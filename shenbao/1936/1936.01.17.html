<p>— 道</p>
<p>近年來國人有一部分因國際援助之渺茫往往發爲偏頗之論以爲今後之對日外交唯有直接折衝今後之救亡圖存亦唯依仗自力此種說法理論上自屬無可訾議唯事實上欲言直接交涉必須自己有力量而後不至於辱國喪權顧三五年來直接交涉中日親善之聲浪時接觸於我人之耳鼓而事實上所表現者則爲土地日益蹙國難日益深罔論失地無恢復之日卽憂患止於何境亦屬毫無把握於是可知自己力量不足難言直接交涉然欲求國力之强需要充分時間目前之環境其能容許我國作若此從容之準備乎</p>
<p>蔣委員長於五全大會中之演說曾謂「和平未到完全絕望時期决不放棄和平犧牲未到最後關頭亦不輕言犧牲」五全大會宣言中對於此點亦曾提及觀此可知當局對於和平之關切與努力然欲求和平之免於絕望則在今日情勢之下勢必尚有賴於國際之切實援助就另一方面而言我國被逼到萬不得已時亦唯有奮起而作壯烈之自衛此種自衛若在孤獨無援之悄勢中自必多犧牲而少效果故無論在目前在今後由外交活動求國際後助實有極大之必要也</p>
<p>或曰國際之路「九一八」來早曾走過特此路不通始退而作自力之應付此言也雖爲事實然人事之未盡在我國亦不無遺憾按國聯對意大利作經濟制裁之時意曾提出抗議以爲國聯於日本侵略中國之後對日旣未施以制裁何以對意大利竟乃絕不寬假英國出席國聯事務大臣艾登卽謂當時對日制裁所以未能成功之原因　爲中國本身並未正式提出此議　爲當時有力過問遠東事悄之俄美並非國聯會員國故國聯未能考慮及此云云艾登此言雖不能謂爲盡符眞理（蓋我國對於第十六條本擬提出特無把握故未提出）然我國人力之未盡亦爲事實往事已矣姑不深論就目前言英法已結成軍事合作之關係集體安全制亦大見强固國聯於制裁意大利一點上旣奏相當功效威望可望恢復英美自海軍會議破裂後日見接近蘇俄亦早成爲國聯之一員國際形勢之改善已非往年可比依是而觀一俟意阿爭端解决國聯當有過問遠東事之能力與餘裕屆時我國再將中日事件提出國聯自爲應有之行動蓋國聯之名詞雖經我人唾棄至一文不値然至直接交涉了無結果之時實尚有借重之必要唯於此所應認識者卽不利用國聯則已若欲利用國聯則當從早向國聯之重要會員國如英法俄等分頭活動從事聯絡吾則難免不蹈往昔同一之失敗蓋國聯乃一空洞之名詞而使其發生作用者僅少數重要會員國而已</p>

<p>華盛頓</p>
<p>史霍系報紙國際編輯辛斯、今日在華盛頓新聞報評論日本之國際政策、謂日本之退出倫敦海會、實與意國受國聯之制裁痛苦、大有關係、蓋日本缺乏天然富源、亟欲控制亞洲大陸之原料、甚至欲南取太平洋口之各島、最後終難免於一戰、故日本之政策、爲力求海陸空軍之優勢、日本不願如意國之被困於國聯、如其海軍能與他國平等、以太平洋中之代管各島爲潛艇及空軍之根據地、在亞洲沿岸各島之問、遍置水雷、則英美兩國雖合力進攻、亦難卜勝利、至於陸地方面、則日本在滿蒙華北、產生緩衝國家、俾其陸空軍隊、可以自由行動、以後除蘇俄以外、亦可不懼任何國家、自此向外發展、安全當可日增、日本亟欲於戰時及平時皆有充份之原料供給、故力欲多得中國之土地、以後或尙擬在西比利亞東部、菲列賓羣島、及荷屬東印度羣島、取得空軍之根據地、於是華北及滿洲之煤鐵、蘇俄之煤油、荷印之油煤橡皮、菲島之各種出產、皆可予取予求、日本如能佔領非島、卽可控制太平洋之一大部份、故其海軍實力、自屬不可少云、（十五日國民電）</p>

<p>德報皆謂日本退出海會、實爲不可避免之事、地方報之評論曰、日本去蘇俄來、又曰、各國無軍縮之誠摯决心、故大會自始卽呈失敗之象、英美或將成立一種恊定、但兩國無日本加入不能製定任何切實的軍縮程序、同時法意兩國將繼續競爭云、又某報對倫敦之新聞加以標題曰、英美排拒日本之海軍妥協、（十六日路透電）</p>
<p>柏林</p>
<p>政界人士對於日本决定退出海軍會議之舉、並不表示驚異、但以爲華盛頓與倫敦兩項海軍條的、各簽字國之間、已因日本此舉而產生一種新局勢、外交部宣稱、德國雖未參加海軍會議、但已密切注視發展情形、德國前於去年六月間、與英國締結海軍協定、旣已表現妥協精神、此際仍極望日本退出海會之舉、不致加重國際現行緊張局勢、並引起造艦競爭、此外大多數各報評論海軍會議、均謂會議失敗、實與德國無關、其中柏林交易所日報載稱、日本退出海會之後、英法兩國本身所處地位、自必加以反省、並引爲口實、而望蘇俄派遣觀察員參加會議、「俾在波爾的海、預防蘇俄方面之威脅」柏林地方日報、亦以蘇俄威脅爲言、並謂「日本退出海會、蘇俄卽將隨之而加入、倫敦方面一幕滑稽劇、行將一變而爲惡作劇、不知此種會議、早成尾聲、卽令勉强繼續開會、此於眞正之軍縮、殆無絲毫裨補可言」云、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>泰晤士報今日評論日本退出軍縮會議事、謂會議仍將進行、俟有充分進步後、將請其他海軍國如德俄等參加會議、以期規畫一種新的、而對和平與軍縮有切實之貢獻、日本雖不幸出會、但世人仍願日本對此良好而必要的工作、予以合作、日本態度顯然不合情理、欲說明其理由、除謂東京之攬大權者對於日本以外之世界大勢、旣無所知、亦不願有所了解外、殆無他語、凡負責之日本政治家斷不欲激動美國作造艦之競爭、日本試再熟思、當可知締結一種協定、縱僅爲彼等所認爲之决要事件、如互換造艦計畫、限定最高噸數與砲力等、然究較全無協定之爲愈也云、（十六日路透電）</p>

<p>— 國立編譯館專任編審　鄭鶴聲</p>
<p>外國人常說中國人是一片散沙，中國人對於國家觀念，本是一片散沙，本沒有民族團體，但是除了民族團體以外，倒有很堅固的家族和宗族團體，總理以爲中國國民和國家結構的關係，先有家族，再推到宗族，再然後才是國族，一級一級的放大，有條不紊，大小結構的關係，當中是很寳在的，主張用宗族做單位，改良當中的組織，再聯合成國族，但我們如何能完成這個聯合的工作，達到「化家爲國」的目的常然要有一個愛國的觀念，但欲養成其愛國的觀念，一方面須打破「不在其位，不謀其政」的惡習慣，而奉行顧亭林先生所謂一天下興亡，匹夫有資」的遺訓，一方面須發揮歷史上光榮的偉績，養成其自信的能力，以引起其國家可愛的情緒，我國自從黃帝開國以來，有久遠的歷史，有顯著的文化，淸朝末年以來，誤信外人的讕言，認定我民族出自西方，固不免數典忘祖的笑柄，更有以黃帝堯舜爲無其人，以夏禹爲九鼎上之動物，是無異毀業先民光榮的歷史，現在爲激引愛國觀念起見，應該發揚我們祖先偉大的精神和基業，年來中央政府崇祀黃陵周陵，就是這個意想。</p>
<p>愛國的嬝動，政府中人，固然應該負資，全國民衆，也應該共同負責，一旦國家有危難的時候，有知識的人應該貢獻意見，有錢的人，應該出錢，有力的人，應該出力，關於這　事實，求之國史，不一其例，好像春秋時候有一次齊國攻打魯國，魯人預備應戰，魯人曹劇就請見魯公，他的鄕人勸他這在位者自有謀畫，勿必干預其事，曹劉不聽，就請入見，供獻作戰的計劃和意見，果然大勝。又秦人將要襲攻鄭國，已絆到了鄭國的境界，鄭國政府中人還不知道，還時鄭國的商人叫弦高在路上遇到，就僞托鄭伯的命令，把自已所有的十二頭牛，犒賞秦兵，幷且派人告知政府，預爲防備，秦將孟明知道計劃失收，就此退兵，又漢朝時候，河南有個姓卜名式的實業家，他本以牧羊致富，這時漢武帝方欲攻伐匈奴，卜式上當願出一半家財助政府努力邊事，政府要他做官，他不願要，問他輸財的目的，他表示國家現在要打匈奴，賢者應該死節，有財的應該出錢，匈奴纔可滅掉！我們看這幾位先民愛國的熱忱，就可曉得當時各國勝利的由來。我們講授本國史，關於這類事實，應該儘量發揮。我們現在國家的情形，內憂外患，交迫而來，國家行政意見的紛歧，人民愛國思想的薄弱，在在可以亡國，我們應該怎樣的挽救呢？歷史上興亡治亂的因果，昭然可見，我國應該加以詳細的研究，以養成國民愛國的觀念，這就是我們學術界和敎育界對於愛護國家的一點責任。</p>
<p>應該研究社會的眞相　歷史的講授，固然要注重於民挨國家的興亡，同時還得要明瞭社會的眞相，以爲改造推進的張本。因爲整個的歷史，除了少數的領袖以外，更寄托包含於多數常人之潛在的社會勢力。所以討論社會進化的痕跡和現今社會的問題，雖爲社會學家研究的要點，但同時亦爲歷史家月重視。我國歷史，向以朝代帝王將相等偉大人物爲記載的中心，對於整個社會的變遷，整個文化的消長，都沒有加以注意。其實不但我國如此，西洋從前史學家，亦有主張以偉人事蹟代表整個歷史的，例如加來爾說：「歷史爲偉人的傳記」一語，可以爲這派史觀的代表，他著偉人與偉人崇拜一書，分述關於神明。帝王。宗敎家。敎士。文學家。詩人等偉人，以爲彼等驚心動魄的偉業，遺留世間，實爲形成歷史的大部，到了十八世紀中葉的時候，有個史學家叫福爾退爾的，才把一時代全部社會的生活，歸納於歷史的範圍，他所著路易十四的世紀一書內，關於風俗論一篇，將沙立曼以來到路易十三止，歐洲道德的，社會的，經濟的，美術的，和文學的生活描寫出來，可謂產生眞正文明史的第一部著作，以後歐西史家，注重社會史的人很多，便不勝枚舉了。</p>
<p>我國自從歐西新史學的學說傳入已來，對於社會史的研究，才有人加以注意。民國十一年中華敎育改進社開會，梁任公先生曾提出「中學國史敎本改造」一案，他以爲現行敎科書全屬政治性質，其實政治史不能包括歷史的全部，舊式政治史，專注重朝代興亡及戰爭，並政治趨勢的變遷亦不能說明，關於社會及文化事項，雖於每朝代之後，間有叙述，然太簡略，且不聯貫。因此缺點，學生受國史敎育完了之後於先民的作業，全不能得明確的印象，故對於祖國不能發生傑厚的情愛，其决所授的史蹟與現代生活隔離太遠，致學生將學問與生活打成兩橛。再决以數年絕少變化的政治現象，其中且充滿着機詐黑闇，學生讀之徒增長保守性或其他惡德，與民治主義的敎育適相背馳，坐此諸因，令學生對於國史一科，不惟不能發生興味，而且有厭惡的傾向。梁先生爲欲矯正固有缺點，順應時代的新要求起見，主張以文化史代政治史。同時何柏丞先生亦有「編輯或講授歷史，應以說明歷代社會狀况的進化，使學生明白現代狀况之如何遞嬗而來爲標準」一個提案，他提案的理由是：歷史的範圍很廣，材料很雜，若專爲事實而研究事實，則汗牛充楝，着手很難，因爲材料旣雜，所以抉擇不易，而在中小學中歷史敎授時間本很有限，若僅述大人與大事，則正如火山大洋不足以代表地理學，虎豹犀象不足以代表動物學，若用斷章取義方法，則因主觀不同的緣故，所編成或所講的歷史，必無顯著的目的，爲抉擇材料便利起見，當編輯或講授歷史的時候，應有一定的標凖。歷史的目的，在於使學生明白現狀之如何遞嬗而來，吾則歷史的效用不著，爲達此種目的起見，應注重社會狀况的進化，這種提案，便是我國創造新史學的開端，不過這種以社會活動爲主體的史著，到今還沒有出世，可見這種企圖是不很容易的。</p>
<p>關於研究社會的演化，自然有許多困難，何先生對於這個問題，已經有過詳細的研究，他說：「我們研究社會的歷史，有兩層特別困難的地方；一屬村料問題，一屬編比問題，就材料方面講：第一就是社會史的材料非常缺乏，例如我們中國的二十叫史，可算是一種汗牛充棟的著作了，但是其中關於一般社會方面的材料却是很少。第二，因爲材料缺乏，月以我們研究一個社會歷史的時候，往往容易犯了掛一漏萬或以偏槪全的　　。第三，根本上社會史的材料，大部分都是　人的記載，不是我們自己由觀察得來，我們要利用他們，必先解决他們的眞僞和　誤等種種問題。就編比方而講：第一，研究的範圍不容易傕定，某一種社會的現象是否普及於社會的全部，還是僅及於一部分，我們要確定他的範圍很困難。第二，現象的種類一容易分淸，一種現象往往在表面上看起來好像政治，但是實際上却由於經濟的動機，亦有在表面上顯然屬於宗敎的，而實際上他的動機在於政治，所以究竟那一種社會現象是純粹政治的現象，那一種現象是純粹經濟的現象，是不容易辨明。第三，因爲各種現象的種類很難辨別，所以我們要在各種社會運動中研究他們的因果關係，就非常困難。政治運動的原因，不一定就在政治，經濟運動的原因，也不一定就在經濟中間。有許多交互錯綜的關係，决不是單在表面上可以看得出來的，何先生這番議論，的確是研究過社會史，以後所發出的眞話，我們承認社會部分歷史的研究，比較任何部分歷史。都感覺困難，允其是要想研究中國的社會史，但我們應該想法打破這種困難。至於研究社會史的目的，自然是要明瞭社會文化的眞相，因爲現在一般國民，對於本國社會的情形，太不明白了，對於本位文化，殊多隔膜，要想改革社會，促進文化，沒有根據，自從東西文化輸入以後，胡亂摹仿，往往失了固有的面目，而蹈於紛亂的狀態。我們研究本國的社會史，應該把社會的組織，社會的風俗，社會的經濟……等等，加以詳盡的討論，至於我國固有文化，例如哲學倫理的系統，文藝小說的思潮，以及科學建築的發明……等等，也要作一比較的研究，庶幾對於我國社會文化，有一明確的瞭解，根據這些研究，加以改造和推進，自然能達發揚民族的或國家的精神，希望我們儘量的努力，逐漸完成罷。</p>
<p>綜上三點，我們講授中小學本國史的目標，無論對於社會國家和民族，應該有個一貫的主張，就是要注重國民的訓練，誠如傳孟眞先生所說借歷史事實做榜樣，啟發愛國心，民族向上心，紀律性，民族不屈性，前進的啟示，公德的要求，建國的榜樣，借歷史形容比借空話形容切實動聽得多，敎育當局，曾經宣示中學敎學的目的，在於養成健全國民，使成中華民族組織的中堅與骨幹，而共內容乃爲科學常識的充分培養，國民道德的嚴格訓練，使凡受中學敎育者，無論研究學術，服務社會，均有完整的基礎，這麼史的一課程，就是訓練國民道德的工具，但於此有一宜注意之點，就是對於敎材的編纂或講授，應該注重於積極的勗勉，勿爲消極的悲觀；應該注重於有效的鼓勵，勿爲淺忿的刺激；應該注重於事實的眞相，勿然盲目的宣傳；應該注重於眞理的研究，勿爲虛妄的幻想應該注重於實際的理論，勿爲奢侈的慾望；務使學生具備正大光明的態度，堅卓不拔的精神，賽成健全的國民，我們果能從歷史敎育上而繳發學生愛社會愛國家愛民族的决心，因而推及各界人士，迎頭趕上，挽救國難，那末中小學木國史的敎育，才有成功的希望，完了。</p>

<p>— 黃寄萍</p>
<p>近年來國貨電器事業，漸見蓬勃之氣，雖然剛在萌芽的電器工業，備受外商的摧殘，而我們幾位電學專家，依然精神抖擻，努力製造，競爭營業，當前的困難，也不算一會事。另一方面，國人購用國貨的心理，已經很普遍，很堅决地演進，這兩種傾向，確是國貨工業發展的朕兆。講到電器事業的範圍很廣，如馬達。風扇。燈泡。電焊。電綫……等，內中電泡一項，凡是住在都市的人們，大有「不可一日無此君」之概。所以它的銷路，却比共他來得廣泛。在十餘年前，我國還沒有製造燈泡的工廠，需要它的人，只好仰給於外貨。到如今，我們可以應用「亞浦耳」或是「華德」的燈泡，這兩種是道地的國貨，聽說現在華商製造燈泡的工廠，也有六七家以上，其牌號如華通。永明·福來勝·永亮·新光華·國華·國泰·中華。中國·德士令。亞爾登。明光。好友。大光明等。共中以「亞浦耳」「華德」兩廠規模較大，品　也比較風行。亞浦耳的內容，大的一個月以前，本報已經發表過了，這裏我要把「華德」的概况，介紹給讀者：</p>
<p>前天午後三時，陰雲籠罩着大地，天氣是怪苦悶的，承華德主人之邀，前往參觀，我們一行四人，黃子鍵。葉長烈。吳錦芳三君及作者，趨車至歐陽路華德新廠，總經理唐兆能，經理兼工程師李慶祥，副工程師李慶華諸君，鵠候已久。茶叙片時，纔知道華德僅有七年的歷史，初時集資五萬，廠設虹口西安路，專製熱水瓶電光燈兩種，後來才專造燈泡的，去年十一月遷入新廠，那座廠房面積不算大而結構很精緻，規模不算大，而機件很新式，確是經濟合理的工廠，現有職員五十餘，工友百八十人，每天出燈泡五千七百只，每月營業約四萬金，出品有銀光泡，（氬氣）好樂泡（眞空）長絲泡，（眞空）氬氣泡，（即哈夫泡）白奶泡，（氬氣）天藍泡，（氬氣）好樂泡，（眞空）橱窗燈泡，天然五彩泡等，自三支起，至二千支，各式俱有。行銷江浙兩省最多，湘那皖粵次之，各處定貨很多，他們抱着現貨現銷的宗旨，擱下的存貨，向來很少，一起有七百餘家經售電料行，所以不愁沒有出路。各省市的路燈，各鐵路。電車。輪船。機關。公司等，都有定貨。因此營業便愈見發達了。</p>
<p>我們一度談話之後，由總工程師引導，照製造的順序，遂部參觀：　玻璃燈殼部，　配料部，　拉絲部，　繞絲部，　騐絲部，　上絲部，　裝心部，　封口部，　抽眞空部，　電化氣部，　　騐光部，　　試騐壽命部，　　裝銅頭部，　　騐燈部，　　包裝部，　　堆棧部，費了兩小時的時間，都仔細地看過了，小小一個電泡從玻璃沙到造成爲止，分析起來，要經過四十七决手續，可見每一事物之成，不論機器與手工，都不是容易的事。我們此番參觀，覺得有兩點値得贊許的：　總工程師李君費了兩年工夫，發明銀光泡，用銀子化爲液體，鍍入泡的裏層，使發出迥光，其功用等於電泡加上一只回光罩，而有省電，光亮，美觀三種效能，這是他的新發明，實業部准予專利五年，現在市上還很少採用，一般人恐怕不知道呢。　華德燈泡暢銷後，外貨如奇異，亞司令。飛利浦。太司令等，便大受打擊，所以他們聯成一氣，和華德競爭，形勢非常激烈，幸而華德的出品，有過之無不及，故國人一致樂用。外貨五百支以上，上海不能製造，須向其本國運來，華德二千支光都能自造，而且華德的售價，總比外貨便宜二成，所以華德能戰勝外貨，總算替中國人爭了一口氣，其他的一切，限於篇幅，恕不盡述。</p>

<p>— 胡</p>
<p>四、分隊的方法</p>
<p>普通的分隊方法可分四種、</p>
<p>第一種是根據兒童的能力分隊、</p>
<p>第二種是根據兒童的興趣分隊、</p>
<p>第三種是根據兒童的生理分隊、</p>
<p>第四種是根據敎材的性質分隊、</p>
<p>這四種方法不妨相互調用、所以有時不妨將分隊的組織稍予變更、以適應需要、分隊組織的變更還可有助於秩序的訓練、並使兒童能在任何人的領隊之下願意合作、而且、分隊的組織如長久缺乏變更、則可使隊與隊之間產生過分的競爭心、但是爲要養成兒童對於一隊發生忠心和責任心起見、分隊的組織也要有相當的特久性、才能產生良好的成績、至於分隊的標幟可用各種隊色來表明、分隊的名稱亦可由兒童共同選定、兒童選定了隊各和隊色以後、就可採用一種標記以示區別、通常的標記、男生頭上可戴一頂色面白底的壓髮式便帽、在未行分隊時、各隊男生可將白底顯白、全班一律白色、在實行分隊活動時、各隊男生可將有隊色的一面顯出、頃刻間各隊即可分別淸楚、而且非常顯明、女生方面、可在頭髮上縛一根代表隊色的緞、一方面可將頭髮縛住、作裝飾用、另一方面可作分隊用、</p>
<p>五、分隊訓練法</p>
<p>分隊訓練的一般原則、</p>
<p>（一）讓兒童自己選擇他們的領袖、自己决定本隊的各稱和隊色、</p>
<p>（二）訓練領隊能講話能發簡單的命令、起初、敎師可領導全班兒童說出簡單的命令、以使兒童分辨命令的强弱、後來、可讓領隊練習發令、讓他們自己尋找適當的語言、以解釋他們要做的事情、切勿允許領隊用耳語的方式去說明領導的方法、</p>
<p>（三）隊中另有副領隊一人、副領隊並不是徒掛虛名、有時、需要將隊中分成兩組時、副領隊即可領導其他的一組、</p>
<p>（四）耍使領隊記着他自己也是隊中一份子、在表誰各種活動時、他也要輪流地參加、</p>
<p>領隊的訓練、</p>
<p>領隊的訓練是分隊的訓練的中心工作、敎師要想將各隊訓練完全、必須先期訓練良好的領隊、在分隊活動時、領隊就是敎師的代表、負責領導全隊共同活動、敎師要訓練兒童及早對於領隊的觀念即有相當的認識、敎師對於領隊不要希望過奢、有些兒童因爲能力的缺乏、或許不能担任領隊的職務、所以敎師不必希望每個兒童都能成爲良好的領隊、重要的原則乃是領隊的任務、要盡量地讓全體兒童輪流分任、</p>
<p>要養成一個有能力的領隊是要經過相當時期的訓練、所以每個領隊要給予他充分的時間以表現他的能力、一個兒童被選爲領隊以後、應該表現他的領導和指揮能力、他還要有正確的表演能力和他種活動的技能、領隊能做一個第一流的代表固然最好、吾則至少要能明瞭活動和遊戲的目的、分別好壞的表演、以及注意同伴是吾遵守規則、敎師還要留心、不宜將注意力全部集中在領隊身上、敎師要鼓勵全隊人員都能應用常識來担負自身的責任、並在必要時襄助同伴工作、</p>

<p>乃德以前被邀作股東，視爲殊榮，因此他勤愼地每天去北尋鷄蛋，賬目登得淸淸楚楚，並且因爲他的努力頗增加了他一些的收入。</p>
<p>「阿韜摩！你竟非此不可嗎？」他說道，覺得這事如果實現，他的令名從此在交易塲中沒有一點地位了。</p>
<p>「我非如此不可，韜摩堅决回答道。「愛彌說當一個人侵蝕了（意思就是拿了錢走出了）一個公司裹的財產，另一個人控告他，或者用別的方法打擊他，不願再和他發生什麼關係。現在你已侵蝕了我的財產；非却不控訴你，也不來打你，可是我不得不解散了我們合夥的關係，因爲我不能信任你，我當然也不願失敗。」</p>
<p>「我旣不能使你相信我，你又不願接受我的錢，可是我寧願將我的錢和盤托出，只要你肯說你相信就我將錢拿去的，這樣我還是感激你呢。務必請你仍舊讓我爲你尋蛋；我也不要工資，只是白做。我熟悉各個生蛋的去處，我也愛做這件事，」乃德苦求道。</p>
<p>但是韜摩搖搖他的頭，他的圓圓而有趣的臉兒，這决看去也竟顯出猜疑和冷酷，當他簡單說道：「不能；寗可你不熟悉。莫再私下去我尋，又在我的蛋上打算什麼。」</p>

<p>— 莫孚</p>
<p>夜是魔術師。</p>
<p>他帶來許多可怕幻影與惡鬼，張牙舞爪，向我威嚇。我感到恐怖與不安。夜偏父這末漫長。要推開他，眞困難。白畫彷彿電光一閃，念四小時全然爲黑暗佔領。我發燒，我失眠，精神不濟，頭如炸彈般時有暴裂的可能，昏昏盹盹沉在雲霧中。曲着的腰幹兒，成了彎弓。——永遠沒有挺直的時會了！我一面這般想着，從屋一隅，踱向另一隅。我小心地提起過於輕巧的脚步，踏着軟綿綿的地板。</p>
<p>一陣嗆咳，我不得不蹲下身去，渾身上下彷彿分裂似地痛楚。驟然之間，我生長了無數翅膀，高高飛上蒼穹——不，這依然是那隻，三年來未會一刻放鬆過我的巨手，抓住我蓬亂的頭髮，往上提——莫非現在就要升天？這念頭尙未轉過，猛不防爲某種大力一擊，我淸醒了，這時却變成了一塊牧羊人　說的滾石，沒命地從高越　霄的山峯上　入無底深淵。我在心中還思念着會不會碰上礁石。雖然很淸楚滾下這千萬仭的絕崖，必然沒命無疑；然而我要活，我盡力掙扎。</p>
<p>……我淸醒了，却橫在地板上，一堆帶血的痰沾汚了我衣裳。我旣弄明白剛才所經過的事，我戰慄了。</p>
<p>搭朦着眼睛，我又看見那隻毛參參的手，三年來，不知在我面前扮演過多少怕懼的悲喜怪劇，且將依然繼續着，直到我的最後，我知道。</p>
<p>光綫渐次昏暗，最後的一絲餘光，亦爲黑暗呑食了，全室籠罩上隆重的夜色。</p>
<p>終於我掙扎到了床上，面對窗子，睜大眼睛，翹望現着蒼色的玻璃喘息。</p>
<p>「不，我不能忍受這重壓」！我决絕地低語着，然而我哪來的回夫之力，留得住時光？經過一次苦鬥，我將電燈扭亮了。這是我僅能做到的，與黑暗抗爭的能力。帶刺的電使我張不開眼睛。</p>
<p>我這病，不宜使用腦經，醫生曾警告過無數决。亦並非我故意反抗。我知道應當休息，需要休息，盡力制止它活動，而結果却愈壞，彷彿腦經是條執拗的蛇。</p>
<p>「死吧！趕快一點死吧！」</p>
<p>我以犯人對劊子手訴說的心情，憤然叫喊着。</p>
<p>痙攀着身子躺在床上，我渴望一分鐘的休息，雙眼屹然凝視着天花板，腦子打着旋，天花板，亦跟轉動，各樣幻影同過去一般開始在我眼前跳躍，旣滑稽，又可怕。沉陷於夢遊狀態了，我覺得忽兒高昇，蒼穹，忽兒低沉深淵，漫山架嶺飛騰着，奔馳着……來到一處無名地方——不，這是地獄羣鬼無忌憚地向我圍攻……渾身冷汗醒來，心在胸中猛烈地鼓動，嘴唇顫慄着，一雙眼睛爲懼怕睜得滾圓，旋視　遭……我將永遠不復回轉平靜了！我看一下置在棹上的台表，還只是數十分種以內的事，長嘆口氣，跟着父是可怕的嗆咳。返　着，經過無數次二有時是惡鬼當胸一刀，鮮紅的血，噴泉似地射滿遍地，抖然一變叉並非爲外力危害，血是自己嘔吐。突然，一個尖嘴巴的怪物出現在面前，伏下身喝盡地上所有的血，然後用粗大多毛的兩臂緊抱我，將管狀的嘴揷入胸中……我爲這無可忍耐的痛苦而暈絕了；有時我看到許多友人圍着我屍身嘆氣，我覺得他們該有多末愚蠢，難道這比活着受罪還壞？有時是躺在荒野的墳墓裏……然而蘊含着同一意味。</p>
<p>最後一次我清醒了，將灰暗燈光疑作晨曦，一絲兒希望又被實施崔滅了。</p>
<p>夜是地獄。</p>
<h3 id="c210">新詩的出路與「胡適之體」 <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— 子模</p>
<p>我對於新詩是很樂觀的，近年來詩壇的動向，明白地吿訴我們新詩有牠的出路。</p>
<p>內容上從個人情調到社會色彩，形式上從因襲的詞藻的雕琢到帶有創造性的俗語化，中國新詩這一種進步，我們總不能不承認。從舊詩詞蛻化出來的「胡適之體」在新詩運動上固然只留有愼糊的痕跡，即使那些顯然受了大戈爾和日本俳歌影饗的「春水體」稍後一點受了西洋浪漫主義詩人影響的所謂「形式優美」的「新月體」，以至前兩年模倣法國不好懂的象徵生義體，在今日新詩墰上也只占幽暗的畸角。跟文學別的部門一樣，我們對於新詩所需要的，是大衆的歌唱，社會的現實的把握和曝露，社會動向的啟示，而現在的新詩人也正向這一個方向努力了。</p>
<p>在形式上，詩與小說戲劇等有一個不同的地方，誠然在於牠的文字的經濟，但是所謂經濟與不經濟絕不是視雅與俗而定，用許多雅的字眼，美的隱喻，顯喻以至典故堆砌雕琢而成的新詩，倘若內容空虛，不一定就是經濟；反過來說，能够用簡單而具體的俗語表現現實，使人發生很具體而深刻的印象和觀感，就是經濟，就是成功的詩。</p>
<p>我這樣說還是主張新詩不需要「優美的形式　不需要技巧，不過，正如女人的美不在於塗脂抹粉束腰和穿高跟鞋那樣，優美的形式不是從因襲求　的雕琢得來。最靈活最具體　有力地表現內容的手段的尋求才是新詩在技巧上應該努力的所在，欲達到這個目的，死的雅的文字應當比不上活生生的口語了。德國新詩人貝塞爾和好些新俄詩人的作品給我們以一很好的例證。</p>
<p>新幾年的目的自由詩就算是失敗，不在於牠的　不雅，更不在於牠之應用口語，（因爲牠實在沒有俗語化），而在於牠的內容貧乏和技巧的幼稚。現在的帶有社會性的新詩的缺點，不在於牠用口語，而在於牠用口語用得不好。道部分與作者的一般技巧的素養和口語的熟練有關，而內容的不充實，作者個人在大衆生活中體騐之不眞切豐富，更是主要的原因。是的，像新俄的詩人那樣從社會下層出身的詩人在現在中國還沒有發現，對於新詩普遍化的希望自不能過奢，不過這個方向是應該而且可以努力的，事實上近幾年表現的成績也不算壞了。</p>
<p>新詩能拿來歌唱當然是很好的，不過能拿來歌唱却不是新詩的不可缺的條件。民歌體或「馮玉祥體」之相對上比「春水體」或「新月體一强，一方面在於牠能拿來歌唱，牠方面也在於牠們之大衆化——描寫大衆和大衆能懂。倘若我們爲着要達到能拿來歌唱一條件，而向舊詩詞學乖，就使成功，也不是新詩的成功。要知道內容固可以决定形式，但同時形式也會影響內容。「舊瓶裝新酒」無論從理論上從詩的發展史上看來都是不行的。用脫胎於舊詩詞的形式來表現新的內容，總會减少牠的現實性或甚至「以辭害意」。</p>
<p>承認了上頭說的幾點所謂「胡適之體」是不是新詩的一條出路，應否採用和提倡，就很明白了。</p>
<p>再就所謂「胡適之體」的代表作「飛行小讚」來講，縱然沒有塡甚麼調兒，但是「小令」的格局臭味還是在字裏行間保留着，來星幾行之所以太「文」了一點，實是怪不得的，因爲在這種舊詩詞的骨架中翻觔斗，不獨翻不出多遠，而且自然而然的會着了牠的道兒。這詩在內容上的有閒階級的「閒適的」意態之表現，更不必說了。不錯，詞曲中（特別是元曲）也有不少很大衆化，値得我們去學習的。但所謂學習不是就模倣或脫胎元曲或明淸雜劇的格調，而是要學牠的大膽地靈活地，貼切地用口語，表現的精神。一時代有一時代的文學內容，也就有一時代的文學形式，正如相對上雅的崑曲之讓步於皮簧那樣，放脚似的「胡適之體」的時代早已過去了在跟舊詩詞厮混熟了的人　也就是伯韓先生所謂「對舊詩詞有素養的那瓤分人，」——的眼中，新詩自然不獨是看不大懂念不上口，而且也不够味兒，但是這不是現在新詩所走的路綫的錯誤，而只是在走這路綫時的步調的錯誤（上頭說的新詩在內容和技巧上的缺點，）而且還是這一部分人的見解的時代錯誤。很明顯的，新詩不必爲這一部分人而開倒車。我們希望於新詩人的只是極力充實新詩的社會的內容，和獨創地運用口語來表現這種內容，造成新的形式。不消說，浸淫於大衆生活中，從那裹增加自己的體騐。和學得活生生的技巧，更是新詩人的先决的條件。</p>
<p>在這個時候還把「胡適之體」特別提出來，認爲新詩的一條路，結果只有「此路不通」吧。</p>

<p>— 任鈞</p>
<p>去年十一月間，筆者曾在第三期的本刋上面發表過「關於新詩的路」一文，對陳子展先生勸新詩人走「胡適之體」兩條路的意見，提出異議。自從那篇文章發表之後，跟着就在本刋第六和第九期上看到陳子展先生的「略論胡適之體」和部分地觸到筆者跟陳先生之論爭的伯韓先生的「最近的詩論與詩話」兩文。</p>
<p>在「略論胡適之體」這篇文章裏頭，陳先生極力維護自己的主張，並盡量替先前的那篇文章下了一番註釋工夫。不通，其中有一點不同的，就是：在以前那篇文章裏，陳先生祇是泛然地勸新詩入走「胡適之體」那條路，而在這一篇呢，則他已經淸淸楚楚地說明：「但我不是希望你仍走『嘗試集』的那條老路」，因爲陳先生也認爲「老路沒有脫去核仿舊詩詞的痕跡，眞是好像包細過的脚放大的」；反之，他希望人家做「飛行小讚」式的詩，因爲「那樣的詩，似乎可以說是一條新路」。這就是說：陳先生勸人家走的「胡適之體」那條路，乃是「飛行小讚」式的「新路」，而不是「嘗試集」的那條老路。</p>
<p>然而，問題也就在這裏。</p>
<p>現在我們要問：像「飛行小讚」那樣的詩，就「胡適之體」來說，究竟可以不可以說是一倏新路呢？這實在是問題的主要關鍵，應該有個確切的解答，祇是含混地說一聲「似乎」可以說或「似乎」不可以說，是斷然不够的。——而想要對這一問題作一確切的解答，筆者以爲最切實最可靠的辦法，莫過於把它拿來跟那連陳先生也認爲是一條老路的「嘗試集」中的作品相較，看看它究竟跟它們之問有何種差異，而且究竟要比它們新得多少。</p>
<p>據筆者所知，「嘗試集」裏面所收集的作品（我所依據的是舊版本），除一小部分係用比較淺近的文言（或稱爲「白話」）做的，塡的，根本不能作爲嘗試作新詩的胡氏之代表作品的舊詩和舊詞（如「中秋」「江上」「沁園春」「如夢令」等）之外，其餘的大部分的作品，可以說都是跟「飛行小讚」同一類型的。現在，且隨手舉「湖上」一詩來做個例子吧：</p>
<p>水上一個螢火，</p>
<p>水裏一個螢火，</p>
<p>平排着，</p>
<p>輕輕地，</p>
<p>打我們的船邊飛過。</p>
<p>仙們倆兒越飛越近，</p>
<p>漸漸地併作了一個。</p>
<p>你看，「飛行小讚」究竟跟這類「胡適之體」有什麼不同？究竟有什麼比較新鮮之處？眞的，你如果有時間和興趣的話，不妨把「飛行小讚」跟「嘗試集」中大部分的作品對照起來讀一讀，那你就一定會覺到那被認爲「新路」的「飛行小讚」不但沒有超過它們一分一毫，而且，不怕它們都是胡氏十幾年前的舊作，你還可以發見許多表現方法耍比「飛行小讚」更加自由，活潑，更加跟舊詩詞距離得遠的作品；雖然正如作者所說，它們多少「總還帶着纏脚時代的血腥氣」。</p>
<p>所以，筆者以爲：要是陳先生始終認「胡適之體」是一條「新路」，要勸人家去走，那也是陳先生個人的自由，旁人自無權干涉；但如勉强地企圖在賣過時貨的舊貨攤上去找些新貨色出來，作爲自己的主張的依據，那是大可不必的。其决，且讓我們再來看看伯韓先生對於這一問題的意見吧。　（未完）</p>

<p>— 王任叔</p>
<p>——讀巴爾札克批判扎記——</p>
<p>在馬利波爾（Marie）著的巴爾札克的批判一書里，開頭就有那樣一段話：</p>
<p>在給「法基諾。卡南」的巧妙的序文里，巴爾札克洩露了他那創作的秘密。——他是超越了自己，與世界之雜多的生活相同化的。看如决一節吧，這是一種吿白。</p>
<p>『「那時候，我住在某條小街里。讀者怕不很知道吧，那是叫做萊台岸爾街的。面對巴斯丟廣塲旁邊的泉水，從聖旦特街開頭，至斯理遂街爲止。求智識的心，把我投入於某的屋頂的房間里。我在此夜里用功。白天到相近的謨西圖書館消磨時間。我過着粗衣粗食的生活。甘心於度那工作者必不可缺的僧院生活之一切條件。無論怎麼上好天氣，到布魯東大街去散步的日子，可說是沒有的。祇有一次爲某種熱情所吸引，把我從研究的習慣中引開了，走出戶外。但是，就是這樣，可不是研究嗎？我得觀察到僻陋的街道上的風俗，住着的人們，和人們的性格。他們和工人們同樣　髒，且同樣不講究禮節。他們　於周圍，可說一點也沒有警戒的。我混在他們中間，看他們論量着賣買，離開工作時相互的爭噪。我底觀察，巳經是直覺的。是深入其人的靈魂的。但也並沒疎忽身體外部的表現。這寗可說是：首先緊緊摑住外面所表現的坦然部分，而馬上突入其內面去的。這樣的觀察，給予我一種生活於被觀察者底生活中去的能力。正像天方夜談中所出現的回敎僧侶，不唸什麼符咒，把人底肉與魂，都能奪了去一般，我和被觀察者交融着了。</p>
<p>『「例如，有一夜，在十一時和十二時之間，我碰到了從恩畢克。柯米克劇塲出來的職工和他的老婆。我記得從龐。特。蕭大街至波買爾西大街，緊跟在他們後面。最初那一對老實人，說　關於看到的戲劇的話。但話頭從這個移到那個，漸漸說到自己的事了。老婆全不曾聽到孩子哆哆囌囌說話，儘管拉着孩子走路。他們二夫婦計算着明天的進帳，想以二十種各不相同的方法，來使用這筆錢。他們首先仔細地說着安排生計的話：什麼馬鈴薯的價値非常的高啦，冬天長起來啦，燒柴騰貴起來啦，以及關於向麵包店借錢的意見啦，他們全都相互述說着。他們的議論非常熱烈，二個人各各不同的性格，在他們話說中確實是很好地給發揮出來了，聽到那樣人的話，我就成了他們的生活中的一份子。我彷彿在自己背上感到他們的襤　。兩脚像穿上他們開了破洞的鞋在走。他們底欲求與希望，一切闖進到我底靈魂里來。也許我的靈魂已經和他們的靈魂相通着了。這是開着眼睛者底夢。工塲的主人虐待他們流氓惡棍，不給他們錢，白跑了不知多少趟。這些話叫我聽了，全跟他們一起憤慨着。棄去了各自的習慣，從精神作用的陶醉中，把自己掩沒，耽溺於這麼個游戲里，這是我的安慰。誰允許我有那樣的才能，有那樣的透視力？這怕是濫用到後來終於會發在的一種性質吧。這麼樣能力底由來的原因，我决不去探求它。我祇說我有這種能力，能用這種能力而已。我從那時起，便着手分析所謂「民衆」這名詞下的不均齊的羣集之各種要素。我得評價他們善的性質或惡的性質，來從事分析群衆。想給讀者知道的，也僅止於此。僻陋的街道，於我有什麽效用呢？從那時起，我才恍然知道了。僻陋的街道，它是各種變革的養成所。在此，英雄，發明家，實力的學者，無賴漢，極惡無道的惡人，有德的人惡棍地痞等等，一切都爲窮乏所困壓，喘息於逼迫下，溺於酒，以强烈的飲料，使身心疲弊而埋葬一生……」</p>
<p>不停滯於外觀與事物的表面，却能提入於規定其他事物的生命的根底里，成爲周圍生活之偉大的啟示者，這樣，才是天才的觀察家的本質。他有在現實中看社會的勇氣，他能在猛烈的攻擊中描寫這個社會。他能用不腐敗的美　的眼光突入，叫出爲許多權力所努力推進的法律與宗敎底眞實任務。由此，他對於能認識自己活着的這個世界的人，給予不可測知的贈物。他對那些人說敎，他以爲世界任何事物沒有不相互關連着。一切事物，在其自身中含有意義，祇是知道分別這意義，却成爲問題。他就是從各種事實中，常常抽出深切而且新頴的敎訓給人。因此，在向自覺的思想　進着去的人類底偉大的敎師們中間，他的地位，是很高的。……」</p>
<p>這一段話，想來於從事創作的人是很有用的。我在另一地方，說過作家僅憑觀察，很容易將現實的眞實，給作家的主觀歪曲了。弄得作品中所出現的人，像被拉到故事中來似的。但像巴爾札克所說那樣，作爲生活之實踐的觀察，那自然又不同了。因爲他不是站在一旁，作冷靜的觀察，而是生活於被觀察者的生活里。這原因，正如馬利波爾在另一處所說：『他對於時代環境及其决定的條件之本質的諸點，有銳利的感覺。他在那里發見車輪的輻輳。」但養成他的銳利的感覺的，是什麼呢。「他是知道社會之可怖的鬥爭，在與金錢的世界作白鐵戰之中，以極煩重的苦惱，决第形成了自己。這是使他的作品，那麼活生生地成爲奇蹟的原因，這也是使他有突入世界的核心的本質的可能的原因。他在不斷的窮乏的鞭子下，全面地而且强烈地抓住他的時代。」</p>
<p>所以窮苦給予巴爾札克的是：叫他强硬而勇敢地，爲了逃避這世界厭在他身上的過重的負担，應於必要，燃起了他創作的火。但這又是使他一日的苦惱，轉化爲壯麗的放射的一種解放。他說：「也祇有工作的時候，叫我忘了自己的苦痛。工作可救了我了，就是最好的說明。同樣也由於窮困，他知道了社會生活總體中經濟條件的重要性。在他作品中，可以看到那些不能適應生活及經濟的社會的構造中那種過渡期的新的必然性的人，是漸漸沒落下去了。『全時代，就以迫人的現實性，通過他那偉大的明鏡之前，叫人認識了那時代里，那跟着工業商業之强力的發達而產生的布爾階級權力之上昇，那向勝利的布爾喬亞的貴族的運動，那覆沒生活的舊形態，在一切領域里，拿出自己的生活形態的新的階級的確立……等等。』</p>
<p>在此，我們也可以說：僻陋的街，它是各種變革的養成所。而窮苦的生活，它是策勵天才發揮其最大的才力的鞭子，他旣爲在苦惱中參澈這社會的眞實。叉得在苦惱中作壯麗的放內射。將心要求的必然性與從客觀的觀點而來的必然性，統一起來，這就成爲巴爾札克偉大的原因了。</p>
<h3 id="c215">口哨 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— 龍貢公</p>
<p>年紀很小的時候，從父親和母親那里，我接受了不同的警吿。父親聽見我吹口哨，嚴厲地瞪起眼睛望住我，說那是賤格的行爲。母親在日間不禁止我，但是在晚間聽到我撅起嘴唇做出那種尖利的響聲，就恐怖地，懇求似地對我說：</p>
<p>「不要做出這種怪聲，不要，那會招鬼的。」</p>
<p>但在後來的有幾决的經騐裏，我非常喜歡那被一部份人認做會招邪魔的天然的笛子。牠底聲音並不是怪聲，是人類底感情的呼吸，淸脆美麗，而且和任何的樂器不同，——何的樂器都不能　　比擬。人類的聲音是不能倣造的。</p>
<p>那幾决的事情，發生在各各不同的地方。一决是早晨，我和一個身體矮小而非常機警的年輕耕家在一條鄉村的小路上走着，我聽見他吹口哨，像是寂寞的山歌，又像是快樂的牧歌。我看見一個純潔，活潑，親切的人。我驕傲有這樣的人類伴着我走路。在海船上，我聽見過不知是什麼人用口哨吹出一個低沉的調子；我底眼前沒有了海，沒有了雲，（雖然牠們是那樣偉大和可愛）我迷失了我自己的所在，幾乎一點都不像幻覺地想起了——或許就是看見了——我底兩個朋友：年輕的，勇敢的，愛眞實的，一個是遠遠地獃在什麼地方，一個是沒有什麼遺憾地死掉了。假使我沒有發見這同樣的歌曲，我會以爲這歌曲沒有別人懂得了的。另外一决，在一個小小的，路徑曲折得很的山岡上，爲了找尋一個已經的好而不知道究竟躱在那里的人、我吹出了我們都喜歡的短曲，突然地，我發見了我熟悉的聲音了。</p>
<p>我已經能够從一個人吹出的口哨去判斷他底理想，性格，和癖好。最初，我以爲是我自己的荒唐，或者，最多不過是偶然的凑合。</p>
<p>有些人吹得一點不好聽，吹得非常殘破，或者吹些惡俗的小調，或者吹出沒有音階的聲音，或者簡直不知道自己在吹口哨。</p>
<p>我認識一些鐵匠，在感情忽然弛緩的時候，他們要吹　聲很長的口哨。有時在馬路上，又會聽見一些和哼聲夾拌着的，苦力們所創造的自由調了。在大學旁邊，那不會有什麼希奇，誰都會聽見于些儼然自滿的流行電影歌。</p>
<p>我對人的觀察證明我自己的拙笨。我永遠不能够從一個人底言語，面貌，骨骼，待人接物態度來推測他是好人或壞人。甚至我知道他做了一件愚蠢的事，我還是不能够决定他底屬類。——因此我必得信賴其他的方法。</p>
<p>假使他會吹口哨，我希望他吹給我聽聽。我自己先吹，一面想：</p>
<p>「嘴不光是吃東西和說話用的。你使牠做別的更好的事情不會損失了牠底價攸。」</p>
<p>我底最大的失意就是倘若他在這個時候反而一聲不響了。</p>

<h3 id="c216">軍事同盟的活躍 <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>不管世界二决大戰會不會就在今年爆發，但一九三六年之成爲一個極嚴重時期，是很顯然的。東菲意阿兩軍尙在相持中，這是危機之一。倫敦海軍會議已瀕破裂，這影響於時局前途，也屬不少。還有東亞方面，一方有帝國主義之加緊進攻我國，他方有日俄的對立，這現象也足以威脅世界的和平。尤其使人不安的，是近日來各地傳出種種關於軍事同盟的消息。火藥氣味已彌漫全世界，今年正是一個浩刦時臨的最危險日子！</p>
<p>關於軍事同盟的傳說，共有四起：一是日德同盟，二是蘇俄與外蒙同盟，三是中日同盟，四是英日同盟。這種種消息，有的自然很不可靠，只能認爲某方面的宣傳作用，但有的却頗能使人相信。例如其中像日德同盟，各方言之鑿鑿，一年來又屢有所傳，現在且有說它們在四個月前，卽已草簽軍事同盟的秘密恊定一件的。這事雖無從證實，又經日外務省吾認，但有入謂這决日德同盟，是由，本駐柏林武官，與德國之防軍代表談判，蓋日軍部爲免外務省出面計，故改取直接行動。</p>
<p>日德軍事同盟，不但各方盛傳，從事實上觀察，也很有可能。蓋它們兩國所表現出來的，頗有幾個性質相近之點。日本是個黷武主義的國家，德國也是個黷武主義的國家。它們同樣是國聯的叛徒，同樣是條的的撕毀者，同樣具有攫取殖民地的野心，又同樣各有一個利害相衝突的敵人（日本的敵人是美國，德國的敵人是法國。）還有反對蘇俄，兩國的立塲也相同。據有些方面的傳說，這回日德同盟，共有二的：一是軍事密約，一是反對共產的公開協定。這樣看來，它們的勾結，無非是要在反俄旗幟的掩護下，進行其破壞世界和平，侵呑弱小的暴行！</p>
<p>蘇俄與外蒙的結合同盟，從兩國對日一點上看，也非不可能。日俄衝突，已日趨尖銳化，進來兩國糾紛時期，形勢十分險惡。有人推測日俄戰爭，勢難避免。至日本與外蒙，最近日僞軍對外蒙威脅更急，外蒙當局，聞已下決心，準備抵抗，。可見它們兩國的對日是一致的。這决外蒙內閣總理等一行，聘問蕪俄，當然具有若干的政治意味。但蘇俄與外蒙軍事同盟，這消息只見於日方的宣傳，是吾沒有別的作用，不得而知。惟以近來蘇俄在外交上所取的方針（卽和平外交）而觀，大的不至於有軍事同盟的締結。</p>
<p>說到中日同盟，這是日本廣田所倡議，由中日聯請蕪俄政府，開放外蒙，如遭拒絕，中日卽成立軍事同盟，以資對付。關於這事，中日是吾有締結同盟的可能，原是一大疑問。</p>
<p>英日軍事同盟，這是舊日同盟的恢復，可能性也很大。歐戰前英日曾締結一次同盟，近來兩方屢有人重提。這决是由英國海軍界一部分人所主張，以爲美國旣泥於孤立政策，未能過問遠東事件，則中日兩國，自可成立一般諒解，若英日同盟能再恢復，則英國在中國的利益，便得以保持。不久原盛傳英美將聯合對日，現時又有英日同盟的風聲，國際關係竟是這樣的複雜。但一看英國最近在海軍會議中，多方遷就日本，就知道所傳非全無據。蓋英國爲要保持其在遠東的地位，與日本恢復同盟，這是它所最希望的。</p>
<p>軍事同盟的活躍，正是大戰將臨的預兆！</p>
<h3 id="c217">冬訊 <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— 羅之華</p>
<p>街道上冷淸淸的，往昔熱鬧的行人，都已縮到毛織品里去了。</p>
<p>我行走在這冷落的街面，像走進一個破舊的院落，心頭有些妻凉。望著那挺直的法國相，就會想到遠方的北國，北國的人，北國的蕭蕭的白楊。</p>
<p>南國是充滿了溫馨的，飄著溫馨的花香烏鳴的南氣，於今，却變成刺人的寒冷。</p>
<p>以前，我是一個夢想老。我夢中的南國，是四季披著春的蔚藍色的：無論是鄉村或都市，都沐浴在溫暖的三月的微風里。當然，這夢是破了，他像世界的任何一個角落，（除了那六分之一的　地。）被飢餓與寒冷交迫着。他像一個患着梅毒的嫖客，在瘋狂地娛樂，掙扎。他很淸楚地知道自己的前途的。當我路上南國的土地，踏上上海的柏油馬路，跟蹤追來的也就是這常見的惡魔，飢餓與寒冷。</p>
<p>當夏天，或春天，我就掛念着冬天的到來，我害怕見到他，他那嚴肅的臉。</p>
<p>然而他必竟來了，掃去了樹葉，掃去了草野的綠色，更掃去了人的體溫：全世界陷在冰窖里了。</p>
<p>我踏着光亮而堅實的柏油路，一陣冷意從脚心傳上來，我的心窩敏捷地感覺到了，嘴唇特特的打若戰，手指像從緊壓中拿出來一樣，發疼，又發凉，那尖銳的西北風，帶着無法解脫的恕意，凍紅了我的鼻頭，鑽進單薄寬大的衣袖。！一切都是冬天了，冬天的街道，冬天的風，我，冬天的行人。</p>
<p>冬天是冷的，殘的，永遠被　咒的。我當然不能來歌頌春天似的來歌頌冬天的。但是，常一個人被熱情弄得瘋狂了的時候，是需要一點冬天的風來吹醒的。正如一個人在春天似的靑春他是生的，春風給他了滋長的力，給了他生長的愛，他生長了。待那夏天似的中年來了的時候，他便暴風雨似的把生活的種子散開了，瘋狂似的攻擊他的敵人。他沒有一點思念，顧慮。但是，秋天似的暮年老了，一切也都隨着秋風的吹打衰老下去了。秋天　一切都衰敗　那靑春火燄都還未完全熄滅，所以四十多歲的人是充滿了火熱的牢騷的。到了現在這樣的冬天，人是老了，他撫摸着被生活磨鍊出光輝的手掌，用冷靜得比冰還深些的心思，數着額角的皺紋，將經騐，那落葉似的經騐，用風力吹到泥沼里，留待他的後起的孩子的參考。</p>
<p>冬天是冷的，將被熱烈的情絲包括着的心淸除了。</p>
<p>我們在冬天的懷抱里，把一年中的記憶重新溫習一下，那樣，我們就可以决定了明年的脚步怎樣開始了。我們將用一切的力量，發揮明春時光給我們的力，向着生活的路。</p>
<p>我踏着的還是那冰凉的柏油路，他擺着發光的黑色的鐵臉，正像生活的臉子一樣。</p>
<p>但是，就是我的牙打戰的聲響再厲害些，就是風吹得更緊些，我沒有工夫管。我向前走。</p>
<p>轉過彎，是較熱鬧的一條馬路，電車帶着急爆的呼喊，像躲避冬的追趕似的飛過去。人們的腦袋縮在大衣領里，手藏在獸毛里，他們在逃避冬天，正像一個老人害怕死亡的迫近。</p>
<p>過來這條街又歸於冷淸淸的路，我聽着脚步的節奏，好已經走遠了的電車的聲響，眼睛瞧着打旋的桐葉，心頭充滿了凄凉，尤共是想起北國的人們，和北國的蕭蕭的白楊的時候。</p>
<p>走着路，在冬風里。</p>
<h3 id="c218">窗 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— 西蒙</p>
<p>對於它，窗，我有多種的回憶和感情。</p>
<p>人一躱在屋宇中，雖不會頓然覺着與世間脫離，但至少是合外面紛紜的事物暫分別一下的。而它，窗。彷彿便是一座橋，把你的心跟窗外的一切依舊接連着，從窗口往下望，或許就有一幅雜亂的街景，嘈鬧的人聲車輛聲一陣陣塞進耳鼓里，使你卽刻又不寗靜起來，因之窗的方向最好是能够不臨街的，往下望只是一條寂寥淸幽的弄堂小巷，長日里也很不容易聽到人的足音，而往上望呢：是掩覆在高叢榛樹的濃綠蔭中的住宅的屋尖，紅色的，藍色的，燦爛地閃耀在明亮的陽光下，天是晴朗，淡靑的，不見一片浮雲，像張不着色的畫，而偶爾自遠方的遙空現出一點點的翱翔着的羽翼，則有如寫入盡里去似的了。</p>
<p>一縷非常輕鬆愉快的情緒湧上心頭來。</p>
<p>那愉快，那輕鬆是因爲窗而來的，使窗的方向換了一個地位，臨着街，你將無端憎厭，和詛咒着，於是忿然把窗關上去了。</p>
<p>找一個窗外邊有着美麗的景緻的窗的房子吧。在漫長的日子里，在不同的季候中，住屋的適當的窗位的確是很重要而又必需的。因着它，窗的關係，往往會改造一個人的心境。在炎炎的夏天，有一只向南的窗在燠熱的空氣中，還不時有凉爽的風吹來，使你透過一口迫促的呼吸，假如是一只向西的窗，六月天的毒太陽灑滿屋子，人便簡直成爲蒸籠中的餛飩了。曾爲了一年的夏天，一只向西的窗，我懊惱過一些時日，瞬問另搬家又是不可能的事，於是房子像隻燃燒着火坑，度了個夏季，彷彿變了半世紀那麼難捱，到得秋凉，人已經被推磨到不大像人了、直至而今，想着又有點痛恨它，那只向西的窗。</p>
<p>而來到嚴寒的冬日，窗是不得向北的。不過在冬日，窗就是有幾隻，也不向北，却總常緊閉着，不常打開的了。並且屋內已生起火爐，籍一口窗，隔別了世界，也同時沒有忘記了世界，祗是阻着它一層玻璃而已。掠窗瞧出去，大地是蕭條了，已無極佳的景物。殘敗的樹木的　枒顫抖於闇闇的天體卞。</p>
<p>這時節，窗對於你較少閑雅的興趣及有更多陰鬱之感。因爲窗外有昏暗的天容，因爲風雨的飄搖下迷離的黃昏，因爲一年又挨近末梢，於是你會不禁發生了一種微烟的輕意，向着溟茫的落着小雪的窗外，思念忽然異機沉重起來了。</p>
<p>在夜中，是岑寂的只讓風撼動着窗，玻璃框子格格作響，冲破了室內凝靜的空氣，此外是再也沒有旁的聲息了。而一個人傾神聽着，那一會兒重一會兒輕的聲浪，心緒也如潮水般在跟着一起一落，這點攪擾，是會呌你一直翻轉着到更闌還睡不着，甚至在一堆荒凉難堪的幻象中熬到黎明，它，給風打擊着的窗，往往有使你受這樣的痛苦的時候。但是你到底不能缺少一口窗的，當破曉，一片稀薄的曙光自窗上透射進來，吿訴你天亮了；當傍晚，窗上的光錢漸漸暗淡下去，你往外一瞥，暮靄濃原地擁着大地，你知道夜來了。</p>
<p>現在居住着的屋舍，竟連一隻方向最壞的窗也沒有，舉起眼眼，視錢卽爲四面的木板所攔阻。宛如藏在黑黝黝的地窖中間，失去窗的對於時問的啟示，完全不曉得白畫是怎樣開始的，又是什麼時候黑下來的。這生活就像在永恒的暗夜中摸索，使我對縱是一只極壞的方向的窗亦熱切地追慕着。</p>

<p>— 白兮</p>
<p>現在又到放學的時候了，xx私立小學校的校長，樂嗣同，肚子里的肚腸千結百結，急得眼睛也紅起來啦！好容易總算渡過了一學期。——在這一學期中，他居然能生活過，眞是他怎樣也想不通的一個道理。</p>
<p>誰都有自尊心的，尤其年靑靑的樂嗣同校長，可是爲了這個小學校，不，爲了捨不得離開天眞無邪的孩子們，他是受盡了債主們的辱駡。他，厚顔地，卑躬甚至近乎屈膝地對着債主們說着好話。……天呵！想不得一切了呵！過去的讓他過去吧！眼前的難關怎末辦呵？</p>
<p>眼前：正在忙着學期考，可是透過這學期考，不是赤裸裸的是他的悲慘的命運嗎？近來他對待小任生特别好，卽使他們有一點兒犯規的行爲，也好言規勸他們，不象往常用着聲色俱厲的態度來嚴責他們了。這爲的什麽呢？還不是爲着一學期將完了，深恐他們會換學校嗎？</p>
<p>每當一個小學生經他好言規勸過後，他就後悔，並且痛恨起來了。——爲什麽我竟作出這種下賤的動作來了呢？我不是孩子們的一個導師嗎？孩子們有錯是一定要嚴責的！是的，我竟辱賤了孩子們的人格了！我是把孩子們當作商品了！喚！啊！……</p>
<p>樂嗣同，這個年靑的校長，頭掛到胸前，他眞想痛痛快快地哭他一頓哩。可是他陡地想到：近來在小學生里不是時常可以聽到一陣子竊竊喳喳的私語嗎？——</p>
<p>“喂！XX學校學費兩元哩！”</p>
<p>“我們這里要五元！”</p>
<p>“太貴了！”</p>
<p>世界是究竟進步得多了！“貴”和“賤”的觀念，孩子們是已弄得一淸二白了！唉！隔壁那條弄子新開辦一個小學校，學費只收兩元。看呀！招生廣告是貼滿各弄，那上面“學費兩元”四個字是又多麽觸目驚心呀！大廣告不算，還挨戶挨家去發傳單，那上面説什麽：“本校因鑒於近來市面之不景氣”呀，“本校爲謀普及敎育起見故只收學費兩元”呀等語，里里拉拉，拉上大堆。天呀！目下做家長的，掙錢難，誰不想送自己的子女到收費低廉的小學校里去呢？……可是這麽一來，把樂嗣同校長急壞啦！</p>
<p>除了『學費兩元』這一個打擊之外，樂嗣同校長還受着『請家長注意』這一張傳單的打擊哩。那張傳單的内容是說：不立案的學校是靠不住的，往往有人假借辦學名義，收了一漂學費就『捲逃』了，所以請各家長先生切勿把子弟送進没有立案過的學校里去讀書。……當然，這反面文章，就是呌人把他們的子弟送往立案的學校里去讀書呀！——可是這麽一來，把樂嗣同校長可更急壞啦！</p>
<p>望着眼前那一批小學生，樂嗣同校長的頭昏暈起來了！他學校弄堂左邊的是新辦了一隻只收『學費兩元』的學校，右邊，却是一隻立過案的學校哩！……天呵！</p>
<p>他痛恨自己去遷就學生，可是他不得不去遷就學生，他痛恨自己象商人那麽地向學生宣傳，說：『我們的學校敎得好』，可是他不得不象商人那麽地向學生宣傳，說：『我們的學校敎得好』呀！他憎恨自己，甚至憎恨他的老婆，孩子，父親，母親，擴大之，他憎恨他的小孩子了，没有了他們，他不是可以不必講那些話了嗎？</p>
<p>可是他還得要生活呀，　他錯了！他嘲弄自己的認識的不足。可是他却更加憎恨他自己起來，因爲他懦怯。</p>
<p>放學的時期一天一天的在逼近。</p>

<p>世問何物易動心。怕有黄金與美人。黃金可奪匹夫志。美人一語如綸音，你看那，多少靑年遭顚沛。亦爲黄金與美人。曾記得，楚霸王英雄烏江刎。他是，依依不捨虞美人。你看那，貪官污吏爭權位。他是念念不休是黃金，有的是，爲黃金弟兄起爭執。有的是，爲黃謀財害性命。有的是，爲黃金親愛仇敵。有的是，爲黃金夫妻兩地分。有的是，爲黃金頃刻　良心變。有的是，爲黃金失節又失身。黃金呀想你是，無上威嚴惡作崇。不知害了幾許人。我看你，顚倒黑白權力大。所以是，黃金可買美人心。試看那，自古美人多魔力。不但傾國又傾城。曾記得，三笑緣中唐解元。脈脈含情爲美人。雙珠鳳中文必正。賣身投靠天官門。一樣秀才不去做。願作低三下四人。休見笑。莫看輕。何非好色愛美人。美人呀可恨你，仗勢欺人權力大。可恨你，只重衣衫不重人。爲了你，同胞手足生意見。爲了你，父子居然起糾紛。我想，世間若無君家在。盜賊不至起橫行。世間若無君家在。不但强國可强身。世間若無君家在。奪什麽遺産害什麽命。世間若無君家在。好好家庭不至起革命。都爲他，燦爛黃金眩人目。都爲你，粉作美人起貪心。試看那，男子十九貪色慾。女子從來愛金銀。故而是，相親相愛金與銀。多少英雄爲誰死。恒河沙數爲兩生。作威作福戲弄人。</p>

<p>Tianjin</p>
<p>Kwantung Army Deputy Chief of Staff Itagaki, Colonel Kawabe, Major Sentada, and others departed by plane at 9:00 AM on the 16th to return to Changchun to report to Kwantung Army Commander Nanjirō Honjō regarding the results of the Tianjin conference. After Itagaki seeks instructions, he will return to Tianjin in twenty days to plan and proceed. Doihara left Tianjin at 4:00 PM on the 16th for a short stay in Beiping and will not return to Tianjin before the Spring Festival. Negotiations on the Hebei-East Chahar issues have been temporarily suspended. If the Tianjin issue is not resolved before the Spring Festival, discussions may be held in Beiping after the festival. Song Zheyuan plans to return to Beiping before the Spring Festival to meet with Doihara again. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM on the 16th, Song Zheyuan, accompanied by Xiao Zhenying, Chen Juesheng, and Chen Zhongfu, went to the Japanese concession's Zhang Garden residence to visit Tada Hayao and Doihara Kenji to discuss the Hebei-Chahar issues. The Japanese side believes that the Pinggu Chaoyangmen and Dagu incidents should be discussed first, and after a satisfactory resolution, the Hebei-East Chahar incidents will be discussed. After exchanging views on the Dagu and Chaoyangmen incidents, and discussing for about an hour, there were still disputes on the Dagu incident. Regarding the Pinggu Chaoyangmen incident, the military and police officers responsible should be punished and a formal apology made, which would resolve the matter. The Japanese side no longer insists on the latter issue very much. After Doihara returns to Tianjin, negotiations on the Hebei-Chahar issue can continue. It is reported that the meeting between China and Japan on the 16th was a preliminary discussion, and negotiations will continue on the 17th. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin</p>
<p>At about 4:00 PM on the evening of the 15th, Song Zheyuan, accompanied by Chen Zhongfu, the Foreign Affairs Committee member of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, visited Tada, Doihara, Itagaki, and Nagami at the residence of the Commander of the Japanese Garrison in Tianjin, on Huayuan Street. They held detailed talks on various issues in North China, as well as the newly occurred Dagu Pinggu Chaoyangmen incidents. Subsequently, there was also a concrete discussion on the development of the North China economy. Song left at about 6:00 PM. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping</p>
<p>After Song arrived in Tianjin, Doihara visited Song once yesterday for a long talk, and exchanged preliminary views on resolving the Hebei-Chahar issue, resulting in a satisfactory outcome. The Hebei-East issue is more complex, and a concrete solution still needs to be jointly studied by both parties. Doihara is still responsible for negotiations on the Japanese side. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Changchun</p>
<p>Kwantung Army Deputy Chief of Staff Itagaki, who arrived in North China to negotiate countermeasures for the North China issue with Song Zheyuan, Yin Rugeng, and the main leaders of the Japanese Garrison, returned to Changchun by plane at 11:00 AM today. The Kwantung Army plans to hold a leadership meeting in the near future, based on Itagaki's report, to determine the fundamental attitude toward China, and to study its so-called joint anti-communism and other North China issues, as well as concrete measures to resolve various outstanding issues between China and Japan. The head of the fundamental news unit in Changchun is also expected to participate. (16th China United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin</p>
<p>Song Zheyuan expressed his apologies for the Nanyangmen shooting and the search of Japanese-flagged stores by Chinese soldiers in Dagu. Therefore, the Sino-Japanese meeting held here last night ended in an amicable atmosphere due to Song's moderate attitude. The meeting last night lasted two hours. The Chinese representatives were Song Zheyuan, Xiao Zhenying, Chen Juesheng, and four others. The Japanese representatives were also four people: Tada, Doihara, Itagaki, and Nagami. Itagaki left for Changchun this morning, and Doihara is scheduled to go to Beiping this afternoon. A spokesman for the Japanese military headquarters stated today that the Chaoyangmen incident has been resolved, and the Dagu incident is still outstanding. The East Hebei Autonomous Council wants to resolve the tax issue first, and the issue of merging with the Hebei-Chahar Political Council will be put on hold. He believes that the merger issue was not discussed at last night's meeting, as it is a diplomatic matter, and the Japanese military authorities do not want to interfere. Hebei has remitted a large sum of money to Nanjing, but in fact, this money should be used for the economic development of North China. He has not heard of the need for a portion of Hebei's tax revenue to be urgently used to build a railway between Rehe and Beiping. The Chinese side stated that the North Ning Railway Bureau's monthly payment of 100,000 yuan to the East Hebei Autonomous Council is a last resort to maintain the integrity of the railway line, as most of the line is within the Autonomous Council's area. (16th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping</p>
<p>Well-informed authorities here all express satisfaction with the Tianjin conference. However, there is little hope of changing the situation in the East Hebei Autonomous Council in the near future. It is rumored that Doihara arrived here tonight and will remain in North China until spring, serving as Song Zheyuan's senior advisor to carry out everything. (16th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>The main points of President Chiang's speech are as follows: First, he explained the international situation in recent years and the process of Sino-Japanese negotiations. Second, he expressed his determination not to sign any treaties that damage territorial sovereignty, and he swore an oath to this effect. All citizens should believe this together. For the sake of maintaining national life, he would not hesitate to make the final sacrifice if necessary. Third, the formation of national strength lies in sound cultural and economic organizations. School principals and students should lead the country, and in addition to patriotic enthusiasm, they must abide by discipline, take responsibility, and have confidence in the fate of the country. They should not be provoked or alienated. They should love the country and not destroy the school or social order. If all the people of the country can be of one mind and one heart and move forward in an orderly struggle, the national crisis will surely be resolved. His attitude was extremely solemn and sincere, and the listeners were deeply moved. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Nanjing</p>
<p>The Central Bank is preparing to reorganize the Reserve Bank. According to Article 7 of the Bank's Organizational Law, government shares account for 60% and commercial shares account for 40%. The National Government ordered the public offering of commercial shares. However, as the Central Bank is reorganized into a Reserve Bank, in order to enable the people to jointly bear responsibility and jointly supervise, I recently proposed to the Executive Yuan to amend the organizational law to expand commercial shares to 60%, which was approved and passed by the Central Political Conference on Wednesday. It will be sent to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. Commercial groups, silver and money industry merchants, and the general public can purchase these commercial shares and be elected as directors, so that the people have statutory representatives to participate in supervising reserve operations.</p>

<p>Kong Xiangxi believes that the Central Bank should be in an absolutely independent position in order to increase domestic and foreign credit and give full play to its functions, which will help to stabilize finance. He specifically proposed to the Central Political Conference to first temporarily expand the limitation of 40% of the total number of commercial shares stipulated in Article 7 of the Central Bank Law to 60%, and in the future, as the economy develops, the government will increase it as needed, and allow the silver and money industry, provincial and municipal governments, and the people to purchase it, in order to share it with the people and show fairness.

<p>After the implementation of the new currency policy, the Ministry of Finance issued eight articles on the exchange of legal tender. Article 1 of the measures stipulates that all holders of silver must exchange it for legal tender within three months from November 4th of the 24th year of the Republic of China, which will end on February 3rd of this year. At present, there are still many cases where silver and silver coins in various places have failed to exchange for legal tender as scheduled, and there are also many remote areas where legal tender has not yet circulated and urgently needs to be promoted. The period should be appropriately extended to benefit merchants and facilitate promotion.

<h3 id="e33">Does Our Country Need International Assistance? <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— Dao</p>
<p>In recent years, a part of our countrymen, due to the vagueness of international assistance, often express biased views, believing that future diplomacy with Japan should only involve direct negotiations, and that future national salvation and survival should only rely on our own efforts. In theory, this kind of statement is undoubtedly unquestionable, but in fact, to talk about direct negotiations, we must have strength ourselves before we do not humiliate the country and lose power. However, in the past three to five years, the voices of Sino-Japanese friendship through direct negotiations have constantly reached our ears, but in fact, what has been manifested is that the land is increasingly shrinking and the national crisis is deepening. Not to mention the day when lost land will be restored, even the extent to which suffering will stop is completely uncertain. From this, we can know that with insufficient strength, it is difficult to talk about direct negotiations. However, to seek the strength of the country requires sufficient time. Can the current environment allow our country to make such leisurely preparations?</p>
<p>In his speech at the Fifth National Congress, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said, "We will never abandon peace until the period of complete despair has arrived, and we will not lightly speak of sacrifice until the final moment of sacrifice has arrived." This point was also mentioned in the declaration of the Fifth National Congress. From this, we can see the authorities' concern and efforts for peace. However, to seek peace that is free from despair, it is inevitable that we must still rely on substantial international assistance under the current situation. On the other hand, when our country is forced to a last resort, we can only rise up and make a heroic self-defense. This kind of self-defense will inevitably involve more sacrifices and less effect in a lonely and unassisted situation. Therefore, whether it is at present or in the future, seeking international assistance through diplomatic activities is extremely necessary.</p>
<p>Some say that the international route has long been taken since the "September 18th" Incident, but only after this route was impassable did we retreat and respond with our own efforts. Although this statement is a fact, there is no regret that human affairs were not fully exhausted in our country. When the League of Nations imposed economic sanctions on Italy, Italy raised a protest, believing that after Japan's invasion of China, the League of Nations did not impose sanctions on Japan, so why should it not be lenient to Italy? Eden, the British Minister attending the League of Nations affairs, said that the reason why the sanctions against Japan were not successful at that time was that China itself did not formally propose this motion, and that Russia and the United States, which had the power to intervene in the situation in the Far East at that time, were not members of the League of Nations, so the League of Nations could not consider this. Although Eden's statement cannot be said to fully conform to the truth (because our country originally intended to propose Article 16, but we were not sure, so we did not propose it), it is also a fact that our country's human efforts were not fully exhausted. The past is over, so I will not discuss it in depth. In terms of the current situation, Britain and France have formed a military cooperation relationship, and the collective security system is greatly strengthened. The League of Nations has achieved considerable effectiveness in the sanction against Italy, and its prestige is expected to recover. The United Kingdom and the United States have become closer and closer since the breakdown of the naval conference. Soviet Russia has also long become a member of the League of Nations. The improvement of the international situation is no longer comparable to that of previous years. Based on this, once the Italy-Abyssinia dispute is resolved, the League of Nations should have the ability and leeway to intervene in the affairs of the Far East. At that time, our country will submit the Sino-Japanese incident to the League of Nations, which is an appropriate action. Although the name of the League of Nations has been spurned by our people to the point of being worthless, it is still necessary to rely on it when direct negotiations have no results. However, what should be recognized here is that if we do not use the League of Nations, then we should not use it. If we want to use the League of Nations, we should contact the important member states of the League of Nations such as Britain, France, and Russia as soon as possible to engage in liaison. Otherwise, we will inevitably repeat the same failure as in the past. The League of Nations is an empty term, and only a few important member states make it work.</p>

<p>Moscow</p>
<p>At today's meeting of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union, Deputy Minister of Defense General Tukhachevsky announced that the Red Army now has a total of 1.3 million people, of which 77% have been trained and possess weapons. Everyone cheered loudly upon hearing his words. Tukhachevsky also said that the monthly salary of soldiers will be increased by 50% this year. Tukhachevsky continued to mention that the increase in military equipment by Germany and Japan is harming the Soviet Union and forcing it to greatly increase the national defense expenditure in this year's budget proposal. The military expenditure in 1936 is twice that of last year. (15th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Moscow</p>
<p>Soviet Deputy Minister of Defense Tukhachevsky spoke during the discussion of the government budget and received a long ovation from the conference. He said, "Military expenditure is indeed not a small number, but the proportion it occupies in the entire budget is still smaller than that of various countries. It goes without saying that it is especially true for countries that are eagerly preparing for a war of aggression. What still needs to be said is that this number is still very small from the perspective of the practical tasks of national defense organizations. Tukhachevsky pointed out the threat to the Soviet Union in the Far East from Japan, and the threat to the west from Germany, detailing the war-mongering fervor of the two countries. He continued, "The situation on our eastern and western borders makes us demand serious consideration of our national defense equipment. The east and west borders are 10,000 kilometers apart and must have simultaneous and independent national defense. This is a necessary principle. In addition, the military force on our western border has greatly increased compared to previous years, so we must strengthen our standing army. Until now, our local troops accounted for 74%, and our standing army accounted for 26%. In order to strengthen the standing army to resist unexpected attacks, we accepted Stalin's suggestion (applause) and reorganized the Red Army infantry according to the opposite principle, that is, the standing army accounted for 77%, and the local troops accounted for 23%. At the same time, the establishment of the standing army can be transferred to war in a timely manner. The extensive increase in the combat effectiveness of our infantry not only creates constant combat readiness but also completes the most complete military training. The cost of expanding the army according to this principle is naturally huge, but this principle guarantees the rapid completion of military training from peacetime to wartime, and it is the most perfect from the perspective of mobilization and military training. When the government needs it, we can immediately resist any strong enemy on both our east and west borders with a strong and prepared force." She continued to describe the development of mechanized and cavalry teams, making them easier to deploy and suitable for national defense, and enhancing the strength of air defense, and emphasized the development of various aviation, and allowed to pay attention to independent aviation, which is the most powerful tool of modern warfare. "Those who dream of seizing Soviet territory have to consider the Soviet Union's aviation power, and they must also consider that they will encounter unexpected difficulties if they want to use air force to attack most of the Soviet Union's industrial centers (and our enemies do not have this benefit).</p>
<p>Tukhachevsky mentioned the development of safety parachute jumping, saying that tens of thousands of Red Army soldiers have obtained safety parachute badges. In addition, the Soviet Civil Aviation Club has made 16,000 airplane jumps and more than 800,000 safety parachute tower jumps.</p>
<p>Tukhachevsky mentioned the navy, saying, "We are now building a strong navy, first focusing on the development of submarines, but in the future, in addition to building submarines, we will also rapidly develop surface forces. Our navy will gradually become stronger and stronger, to the same level as the army and air force." He continued to describe the consolidation of coastal defense and the increase in seaplane power by several times, and filling it with the latest aircraft, and said, "Our development of the navy is to thicken the coastal defense on both the east and west sides. This goes without saying. These various methods of strengthening national defense will necessarily strengthen the overall military force." In 1936, the strength of the Red Army will increase to 1.3 million people (cheers, applause, followed by cheers to Stalin and Voroshilov).</p>
<p>Tukhachevsky reported on the completion of the slogan put forward by Stalin, "Create cadres and make them control technology," pointing out that the adoption of military titles created a solid foundation for cultivating commanders and technical cadres. The number of aviation, armored vehicle, artillery, and infantry schools has greatly increased. The equipment of these schools has been greatly improved to improve the training of experts. The Red Army has 13 military academies to cultivate various specialized talents, and there are six military specialized schools affiliated to ordinary universities. There are more than 16,000 students in military academies. The flying fields and shooting ranges for training troops have also greatly increased. The cultural and living conditions of the Red Army have greatly improved, and the soldiers' pay has also increased. The amount of pay in 1936 increased by 57%. Tukhachevsky reiterated the annual improvement of the Red Army's work and organization, and the elimination of various shortcomings, saying that "because of this, our work has guaranteed that the military training of the Red Army will reach an extremely high level that no other country can match." Finally, he said, "I hope that the conference will approve the military budget. If so, the Red Army and all its personnel will be able to devote all their strength and enthusiasm to controlling the complex art of modern warfare, and under the leadership of our leaders Voroshilov in the party and Stalin, if the enemy attacks the border, they will respond with a complete victory." Tukhachevsky's concluding remarks were submerged in applause. The conference cheered long live Stalin, Voroshilov, and the Red Army. (15th TASS Dispatch)</p>

<p>Moscow</p>
<p>People's Commissar of Finance Klinko spoke on the 1936 national budget at the Second Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union, saying, "In 1935, the income budget was 63.6 billion rubles, and the actual income was 64.6 billion rubles. The expenditure budget was 63.1 billion rubles, and the actual expenditure was 63.9 billion rubles. Therefore, last year's income exceeded expenditure by 700 million rubles, which is a huge contribution to socialist construction. The main items in last year's budget were all completed, and some items were even exceeded. Due to the success of socialist construction and the complete abolition of the bread coupon system, commodity trade increased from 60 billion rubles to 80 billion rubles. In the Soviet Union, the Soviet ruble is only a medium of exchange, so it is more stable than any currency in the world."</p>
<p>Klinko continued to describe the 1936 budget, saying that the government budget for 1936 fully reflects the strong development of socialist construction in 1936. The total amount of this resolution budget reached 78.5 billion rubles, which is more than 14 billion rubles higher than last year's settlement. Due to the Stakhanovite movement, the efforts of various enterprises to increase profits, and the increase in the total profits of various economic organizations, the new budget also increased by a percentage of. Klinko continued to describe the expenditure, saying that the amount of construction investment reached 32.3 billion rubles, and the budget for national defense expenditure was even more approved by the conference with special applause. Klinko pointed out that national defense expenditure was larger in 1935, with a budget of 6.5 billion rubles and an actual expenditure of 8.2 billion rubles. The national defense expenditure in 1936 will increase to 14.8 billion rubles. Klinko said, "The increase in national defense expenditure is to increase military strength and improve its technical equipment, expand barracks, and increase political education expenditure." Klinko continued to describe the amount of expenditure on social and cultural undertakings, which also increased from 16 billion rubles to 21 billion rubles this year, excluding those spent by trade unions, a total increase of 5 billion rubles. The construction of schools has greatly increased, and the number of schoolchildren has increased to 28 million this year. The expenditure for training cadres and talents has almost increased by 1 billion rubles. The expenditure on public health has increased from 4.7 billion to 6.2 billion rubles. Klinko said, "The 1936 budget is obviously based on the general increase in national wealth, and the continued development of socialist construction can not only be completed but also exceeded."</p>
<p>The amount of investment in housing construction and urban construction is 5.57 billion rubles, and the retail sales of state-owned cooperative stores are 100 billion rubles, and retail prices will be reduced in 1936. The total number of workers and employees will reach 25,725,000, and the wage fund will increase from 56.2 billion rubles in 1935 to 63.4 billion rubles in 1936. Social and cultural expenses will increase by 33.6% compared to 1935, reaching 17.638 billion rubles. The social insurance expenditure is 8 billion rubles, while it was 6.7 billion rubles in 1935.</p>
<p>In 1936, there will be 85,300 students graduating from universities and technical specialized schools, and 138,100 people graduating from ordinary technical schools. The fourth year of the Second Five-Year Plan guarantees the considerable consolidation of the country's political and economic strength, and further promotes its technical and economic independence and its national defense strength. The implementation of this plan is to complete the four years of the Second Five-Year Plan in all major parts of the national economy, and to guarantee the early completion of the entire Five-Year Plan. The Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union proves the firm expectation of the Soviet people for peace and supports the resolute implementation of the peace policy of the People's Committee. At the same time, the Central Executive Committee believes that the unconditional completion of the economic tasks in 1936 and the consolidation of the Soviet Union's national defense strength on this basis are necessary conditions for completing the policy of striving for peace.

<h3 id="e45">Mongolian-Manchurian Border Disputes: Manchuria Threatens to Take Decisive Action; Exchange of Documents Published; Russian Dispatch Reports Japanese-Manchurian Troops Invading Mongolian Border Again <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Moscow</p>
<p>The Mongolian government and the "Manchukuo" government recently exchanged sternly worded documents regarding border cases. A document from the "Manchukuo" Foreign Ministry to the Mongolian government on December 25 stated that it would disregard everything and take practical countermeasures. Three days later, it issued another document stating that it would be forced to implement any necessary plans for self-defense. The Mongolian government replied on January 12, saying that the nature and wording of the letter were sufficient to prove that the "Manchukuo" government did not want to peacefully resolve the border cases caused by the Japanese and "Manchukuo" soldiers, and to prevent the continuation of similar incidents that clearly intended to cause disputes between the two sides. The Mongolian people are now devoting all their efforts to economic and cultural development. No one in the world believes that they will plot to engage in war with Japan or provoke Japanese and "Manchukuo" troops. The Mongolian government asked "Manchukuo" to pay attention to the serious danger to peace contained in the continued invasion of the Mongolian border, and that the Mongolian soldiers detained by the "Manchukuo" side should be released immediately. According to the report, both sides are now vying for the land where the incident was initiated, which is within their own borders. (15th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Kulun The Kulun report said that the local newspapers have published the exchange of documents between the Mongolian People's Republic and "Manchukuo" regarding the attack on the Mongolian border by Japanese-Manchurian troops on December 9, 1935. The "Manchukuo" Foreign Minister issued a document on December 25, replying to the protest raised by the Mongolian government on December 22. The document falsely claimed that the conflict between the Japanese-Manchurian troops and the Mongolian border guards occurred within "Manchukuo" territory, the reason being that the Mongolian troops invaded the Manchukuo border, and stated that "regardless of the outcome, decisive action will be taken."</p>
<p>On December 24, Japanese-Manchurian troops attempted to attack the Mongolian border guard camp in the Brantson area again, but were unsuccessful due to the resistance of the Mongolian border guards. The "Manchukuo" Foreign Minister therefore issued another note to the Mongolian government on December 28, falsely claiming that the attack on the Mongolian border by Japanese-Manchurian troops was a Mongolian troop attack on the "peaceful" Manchukuo troops, and attached a protest, and again made the threat of "in the future, any necessary self-defense actions may be forced to be adopted."</p>
<p>The government of the Mongolian Republic replied to the government of "Manchukuo" on January 12, saying that the tone used in the two documents of the "Manchukuo government" can only prove that the "Manchukuo government" is unwilling to peacefully resolve the border conflict caused by the Japanese-Manchurian troops and prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, with the aim of clearly increasing the disputes between Mongolia and Manchuria. The Mongolian government pointed out in its document that "no one in the world can believe or will believe that the Mongolian people, who are devoting all their efforts to economic and cultural construction and deeply desire to maintain peaceful relations with neighboring countries, plan to fight with Japan or provoke Japanese-Manchurian troops." The Mongolian government pointed out that the "Manchukuo" Foreign Minister's accusations against the Mongolian government were unfounded and urged "Manchukuo" to pay attention to how the continued attack on the border guards of the Mongolian People's Republic and the refusal to take appropriate measures to resolve these disputes will endanger the peace policy. It also reiterated the requirement in the Mongolian government's document of December 22, especially to return the Mongolian soldiers captured from Mongolian territory. (16th TASS Dispatch)</p>
<p>Kulun Yesterday, at 9 a.m. on the 15th, the Mongolian border patrol team encountered Manchukuo troops invading the territory of the Mongolian Republic in a valley near Lake Hananur (25 kilometers from the border). The Manchu troops opened fire on the Mongolian soldiers. The Mongolian soldiers surrounded them. The Manchu troops wanted to escape, but they were all detained. There were a total of seven Manchu soldiers wearing military uniforms, seven Japanese rifles, a lot of ammunition, and seven horses were confiscated. There were no casualties on either side. At the same time, 30 yurts of the Bagut nomads were found in the same place. They were protected by the aforementioned Manchu troops to invade the Mongolian territory. They also said that the Japanese commanded the Bagut people's army in Manchukuo. This time they came under the orders of the Japanese. The Japanese told them that the Mongolian territory adjacent to Manchukuo was all Manchu territory. After the Mongolian side explained that the mines here were Mongolian territory and suggested that they return to Bargal, they all agreed and immediately turned back. (16th TASS Dispatch)</p>

Germany's rearmament has long made Britain vigilant, but as Germany's military spending has been continuous in recent years, Britain's vigilance has increased day by day, which is undoubtedly true."

<p>Japan's withdrawal from the London Naval Conference has prompted responsible parties to express that the US Navy Department will soon ask Congress for continued funding to build more battleships. It is heard that an experimental plan has been drawn up to modify two existing battleships or build a new battleship by the end of the year to fill the gap. This decision will proceed simultaneously with the procedure of building a navy according to the treaty. Senator Pittman, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said that the plan to continue restricting naval armaments has now failed. Since Japan has withdrawn from the conference, the United States cannot agree with any other country to reduce its navy. Japan's withdrawal clearly means unlimited expansion of its fleet.

<p>The United Kingdom and the United States will have plans for Pacific defense and facilities in the future. The Army is now planning to establish a joint defense plan with the Navy, but the Japanese government's policy, although it has withdrawn from the disarmament conference, still intends to avoid the competition of expanding armaments as much as possible. Therefore, the Army also intends to maintain the status quo as much as possible for Pacific defense facilities and adopt a calm attitude. (16th, Allied dispatch)</p>

<p>London</p>
<p>Japan has withdrawn from the naval conference. This decision by Japan was expected long ago. Yesterday afternoon, the first committee of the naval conference met for a long time. The Japanese representatives reiterated their demand for equality, and the representatives of other countries expressed their opposition. Therefore, the Japanese delegation decided to withdraw from the conference and issued a long article stating the reasons for its withdrawal and defending its proposal for a common maximum limit, saying that reducing or abolishing aggressive armaments is the most reasonable way to obtain a state of non-harm and non-aggression. In this way, the concept of security can be strengthened, and progressive disarmament can eventually be achieved. It also said that what we want to clearly state is that although we are withdrawing from the naval conference, we have no intention of engaging in an arms race. We are determined to always promote world peace and to promote world peace by carefully creating the best friendly relations with other countries.</p>
<p>British Naval Minister Monsell, who chaired yesterday, spoke freely about Britain's attitude towards Japan's proposal, saying that the Washington Treaty is the best guarantee of security. Britain, like Japan, wants to reduce its navy, but this reduction must be done in a way that is fair to all parties and does not harm the security of any country. From the British delegation's point of view, naval power cannot be measured by the number of ships alone, without taking into account other factors such as the distance of bases, the source of supply, and the vulnerability of transportation lines. A country with responsibilities all over the world must pay attention to its navy to protect its maritime communications. Therefore, its naval power must be higher than that of a country that can maintain its entire navy within or near its own territorial waters. Therefore, the British government and the public feel that Japan's proposal will create a situation unfavorable to the British Empire. Accepting this proposal is tantamount to suicide. Japan only has one sea that is closely related to its survival, while Britain must defend the roads of seven seas. If Japan's proposal is applied to all countries in the world, then all countries, no matter how weak their financial resources or how small their responsibilities, will not only have the right to build a navy equal to that of their neighbors, but will also be encouraged to increase their armaments. This plan is suitable for encouraging countries with existing small navies to greatly increase their armaments.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Britain's Five Points <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>In short, Britain's attitude can be divided into six points: Naval equality cannot be measured by the number of ships alone, but the distance of bases and the length of transportation routes must also be considered. Countries with larger navies cannot neglect the necessary defenses of their land and focus solely on fleets stationed in distant places. Countries with responsibilities all over the world must use their naval power to protect their entire transportation lines and the transportation between all parts, and must also have a greater naval power than countries whose entire fleet is in their own territorial waters. A common maximum limit is not suitable for the needs of the British Empire's defense, because the British Empire must consider its responsibilities in the European Sea, the Atlantic, and the Pacific. The Washington Treaty is the best guarantee of equality and security. Japan's proposal will cause Britain to encounter a bizarre situation, because this proposal not only allows all countries, no matter how weak their financial resources, to build ships to compete with their neighbors, but also indirectly encourages all countries to engage in shipbuilding competition. It feels that Japan's plan cannot be the basis for disarmament or restriction, and is deeply regretful, but it hopes that the Japanese delegation will continue to cooperate with other delegations to seek alternative methods to achieve the common goal of disarmament of all countries. (16th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London</p>
<p>In today's general committee of the naval conference, the arguments made by the representatives of the British Dominions all supported Britain's position. For example, the chief representative of Australia, Bruce, said that Japan's proposal has lost the original intention of restricting armaments and cannot achieve the goal of security equality. The chief representative of India, Birdlow, believed that there was no acceptable point in Japan's proposal. The arguments cited by the chief representative of Canada, Massey, were also very close to Britain's position. The chief representative of South Africa, De Wet, said that the common maximum amount proposed by Japan, if the limit set is appropriately increased, so that countries whose national defense needs are above those of other countries have room for maneuver for the sake of safety, then this proposal may be accepted.

<p>London</p>
<p>French representative Vice Admiral Robert gave a speech at the General Committee of the Naval Conference this afternoon, saying, "Japan advocates that each naval country should have the autonomous right to decide on the naval force necessary for maintaining its security. France agrees with this proposition. Based on this principle, the security conditions of each country are different, and its naval armaments will naturally be different. However, what we do not understand is that if the naval armaments of each country should be equal to each other, just as the common maximum amount system proposed by Japan stipulates, even if the equal status is limited to so-called offensive warships, then how will this so-called equality make it compatible with the different national defense needs of each country? As a result, some countries will find it difficult to obtain sufficient security, while other countries will enjoy excessive protection, and then aggression and threats will arise, which all of us want to avoid, and the Japanese delegation also has the same mentality." Vice Admiral Robert then advocated that the naval conference should re-submit the compromise proposal put forward by France, that is, the suggestion of exchanging information on shipbuilding, and advocated the establishment of another committee to sort out France's suggestions, while the first committee should continue to cooperate with Japan, so as to continue to study other issues. This procedure of taking care of both sides should be sought immediately. (15th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>London</p>
<p>The General Committee of the Naval Conference met at 3:30 PM today. Italian Chief Representative, Ambassador to Britain, Grandi, spoke, saying that Italy fully agreed with the principles on which the common maximum amount proposal put forward by Japan was based. However, Italy was extremely opposed to strictly determining the total tonnage of the navy of each naval country by the current ratio system or by the common maximum amount system. In Italy's view, Japan advocates that the naval tonnage of each country should be differentiated according to its geographical location. How is this different in practice from the ratio system? Is the so-called strict egalitarianism not abandoned? (15th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e65">Hirota Issues Statement <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Hirota issued a statement today on the withdrawal from the naval disarmament conference. The full text is as follows: Maintaining international peace and contributing to its promotion is the consistent national policy of the Japanese government. When the London Naval Disarmament Conference was convened, Japan gladly participated, also based on this national policy. The Japanese government's policy of participating in this decision meeting is to ensure the firmness of national defense, reduce the burden on the people, and enhance friendly relations between countries through a fair and appropriate naval disarmament agreement between the countries concerned. The Japanese government then appointed Japanese representatives to propose at the meeting to set a common maximum limit that the naval forces of each country cannot exceed within the scope of not harming the sense of security of each country, and to reduce this limit as much as possible, so that each country can maintain armaments that are difficult to attack but have no defensive insecurity. It also advocated greatly reducing offensive weapons such as battleships, aircraft carriers, and class A cruisers, in order to realize thorough disarmament and establish the principle of non-threat and non-aggression. However, regardless of the efforts of the Japanese plenipotentiaries, Japan's fair and appropriate fundamental主張 was not accepted by the countries. Japan also hoped to solve problems with the possibility of resolution at the meeting, made a treaty, issued a joint declaration, stated that it would not engage in an arms race in the future, and sought to complete the meeting satisfactorily. However, Japan's sincerity was not recognized by the countries. Therefore, the Japanese representatives had no choice but to withdraw from the meeting. Although, whether or not the disarmament treaty exists, the Japanese government of course respects the spirit of non-threat and non-aggression. It goes without saying that there is no intention of inducing an arms race. The original intention of the Japanese government to cooperate in the disarmament cause for world peace has not changed. It sincerely hopes that the governments of all countries will understand the sincerity of the Japanese government's advocacy of armaments reduction as soon as possible. (16th, Allied dispatch)</p>

<p>Washington</p>
<p>International Editor Sins of the Shaw series newspapers commented on Japan's international policy in the Washington News today, saying that Japan's withdrawal from the London Naval Conference is closely related to Italy's suffering from the League of Nations' sanctions. Because Japan lacks natural resources, it is eager to control the raw materials of the Asian continent, and even wants to take the islands at the Pacific mouth to the south. In the end, it is difficult to avoid a war. Therefore, Japan's policy is to strive for the superiority of the army, navy, and air force. Japan does not want to be trapped in the League of Nations like Italy. If its navy can be equal to other countries, with the trust islands in the Pacific as bases for submarines and air forces, and mines are placed all over the Asian coastal islands, it will be difficult to predict victory even if Britain and the United States join forces to attack. As for the land, Japan is producing buffer states in Manchuria and North China, so that its land and air forces can move freely. In the future, in addition to Soviet Russia, it can also not fear any country. Since then, external development will be safer day by day. Japan is eager to have a sufficient supply of raw materials in both wartime and peacetime, so it is striving to gain more land in China. In the future, it may also plan to acquire air force bases in eastern Siberia, the Philippine Islands, and the Dutch East Indies. Then, the coal and iron of North China and Manchuria, the oil of Soviet Russia, the oil, coal, and rubber of the Dutch East Indies, and the various products of the Philippine Islands can all be obtained. If Japan can occupy the non-island, it can control a large part of the Pacific, so its naval strength is naturally indispensable. (15th, National Telegraph dispatch)</p>

<p>Berlin</p>
<p>German newspapers all said that Japan's withdrawal from the naval conference was inevitable. A local newspaper commented, "Japan is coming from Soviet Russia," and "The countries have no sincere determination to disarm, so the conference has been a failure from the beginning. The United Kingdom and the United States may establish a certain agreement, but the two countries cannot formulate any practical disarmament procedures without Japan's participation. At the same time, France and Italy will continue to compete." A certain newspaper headlined the news from London as "The United Kingdom and the United States Reject Japan's Naval Compromise." (16th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin</p>
<p>Political figures did not express surprise at Japan's decision to withdraw from the naval conference, but believed that the Washington and London naval treaties had created a new situation between the signatory countries due to Japan's move. The Foreign Ministry stated that although Germany did not participate in the naval conference, it had been closely watching the development of the situation. Germany signed a naval agreement with the United Kingdom in June last year, and has already shown a spirit of compromise. At this time, it still hopes that Japan's withdrawal from the naval conference will not aggravate the current international tensions and cause shipbuilding competition. In addition, most newspapers commented on the naval conference, saying that the failure of the conference was actually unrelated to Germany. Among them, the Berlin Stock Exchange Daily reported that after Japan's withdrawal from the naval conference, the position of Britain and France themselves must be reflected upon, and used as an excuse to hope that Soviet Russia would send observers to participate in the conference, "so as to prevent the threat from the Soviet Union in the Baltic Sea." The Berlin local daily also spoke of the threat from Soviet Russia, and said, "Japan's withdrawal from the naval conference will be followed by Soviet Russia's joining. A farce in London is about to turn into a prank. I don't know that this kind of conference has long been coming to an end. Even if it is forced to continue, it will hardly be helpful for genuine disarmament." (16th, Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>At yesterday's meeting of the General Committee of the Naval Conference, the Japanese delegation did not offer any response to the statements made by representatives of other countries. It remains unknown whether the observer sent by Japan will attend today's meeting. However, it is generally believed that even though Japan has withdrawn, the representatives of other countries at the Naval Conference will still strive to find a procedure to formally establish an agreement. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>London</p>
<p>The Times today commented on Japan's withdrawal from the disarmament conference, saying that the conference will continue, and once sufficient progress has been made, other naval powers such as Germany and Russia will be invited to join the conference to plan a new approach that makes tangible contributions to peace and disarmament. Although it is unfortunate that Japan has withdrawn, the world still hopes that Japan will cooperate in this good and necessary work. Japan's attitude is clearly unreasonable, and there is no other way to explain it other than to say that those in power in Tokyo have no knowledge of the world situation outside of Japan, nor do they wish to understand it. No responsible Japanese politician would want to provoke the United States into a naval building competition. Japan should reconsider and realize that concluding an agreement, even if it only covers what they consider to be the most crucial issues, such as exchanging shipbuilding plans and limiting maximum tonnage and firepower, is still better than having no agreement at all.

<p>The southern front is currently experiencing the most intense fighting since the start of the war.

However, they were eventually forced to retreat, and the Italian army pursued them. By January 12th, the Italian advance was blocked by the Abyssinian rearguard, leading to a fierce battle. Judging by the number of troops involved on both sides and the extent of the battle area, it can be considered a major engagement. The Italian army has so far advanced its battle line by fifteen miles. It is estimated that 500 Abyssinian soldiers have died, and 100 Italian soldiers have died.

<h3 id="e90">Student Patriotic Demonstrations in Guangdong Province: Removal of the Signboard of the Guangdong Provincial Education Department; Authorities Organize Volunteer Corps to Accommodate Students <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: Since the first patriotic parade was held by students in Guangdong Province, there was an incident on the 30th of last month where two students from the National Guangdong College of Law, surnamed Liang and Mai, assaulted the military training director and coerced classmates to sign documents. The college immediately announced the expulsion of the two students and handed them over to the Garrison Headquarters for investigation. This matter had just subsided when students from Sun Yat-sen University launched a second demonstration parade on the 9th of this month. When they reached the Education Department on Huiai West Road, they went to the department to petition. Unexpectedly, the students removed the "Guangdong Provincial Education Department" signboard and carried it away. On the same day, some students from Guangya Middle School (formerly the Provincial First Middle School) also participated in the parade. After the parade, they returned to school and demanded that the school authorities grant a one-month vacation so that students could go to various villages to promote patriotism. The principal of the school, surnamed Huo, was not on campus at the time. On the 10th, the students held another meeting, and the atmosphere was tense. Military police arrived to persuade and explain, and order was restored. The authorities, seeing the growing momentum of the students in recent days, immediately discussed response measures to prevent any excesses. It was decided to organize enthusiastic patriotic students into volunteer corps and female students into nursing corps, allowing students to participate freely. Those who continue to attend classes as usual would not be forced. A Volunteer Corps Headquarters would be established at Sun Yat-sen University, with Chen Jitang appointing Garrison Commander Li Shuzong as the concurrent Chief Commander. The First Battalion Headquarters would be attached to the Sun Yat-sen University Headquarters, with Hua Zhenzhong serving as the concurrent First Battalion Commander and Rao Hanjie serving as the concurrent Second Battalion Commander. The Battalion Headquarters would be located at Guangya Middle School, with Ruan Baohong serving as the concurrent Third Battalion Commander. The Battalion Headquarters would be located at the Municipal Second Middle School. After the incident of the removal of the Education Department signboard, Zou Lu, President of Sun Yat-sen University, telegraphed all parties on the 10th, stating that he had failed in his educational duties and should be dismissed and severely punished to clarify responsibility and rectify the academic atmosphere. The Southwest Political Affairs Council issued three orders regarding this matter on the 10th, the original text of which is as follows:</p>
<p>"It is hereby ordered that national salvation and resistance to aggression are the Council's long-standing and greatest advocacy. For years, we have based all our efforts on this purpose, declaring to the people of the country and striving to promote progress without the slightest slackening. The facts are in evidence, and the whole country knows it. Recently, students, recognizing the increasing seriousness of the national crisis, have engaged in extracurricular promotion, parades, and demonstrations. Their patriotic enthusiasm is commendable. However, national salvation and resistance to aggression are major matters that cannot be accomplished with empty words or achieved by luck. Students, as the outstanding members of the country, should at this time intensify their practice of practical national salvation science as an urgent need to resist the enemy and defend against aggression. Even if they think of using speech and action to awaken the people of the country, they should make appropriate expressions within the scope of discipline. If they merely act on impulse and forget the fundamental plan, wasting time and neglecting their studies, they will not only harm the strength of resistance to aggression but also violate the original intention of national salvation. In order to implement the Council's long-standing advocacy and to fulfill the students' patriotic enthusiasm, it is imperative to concentrate the students' national salvation efforts and授以救國實用科學技能(provide them with practical national salvation scientific skills.)Therefore, the First Army Group Commander is specially ordered to organize a national salvation volunteer corps and a national salvation nursing corps, select a site, and properly allocate male and female students from various schools for enlistment and training to fulfill the students' aspirations for national salvation. The said commander should instruct all students to abide by this order, wait quietly for enrollment and training, and study national salvation academic subjects to deal with the national crisis and resist foreign aggression. This is our hope. This order."</p>
<p>"It is hereby ordered that student patriotic movements originate from loyalty, indignation, and enthusiasm. If there is no one to lead them, they will inevitably become undisciplined, and it is feared that malpractices will arise, resulting in a loss of national salvation power. Therefore, a national salvation volunteer corps and a national salvation nursing corps should be organized immediately, a site should be selected, and male and female students from various schools should be properly allocated for enlistment and training to fulfill the students' aspirations for national salvation and avoid being led astray. In addition to ordering the First Army Group Commander to comply and distribute orders, the Provincial Government is hereby ordered to inform them and instruct all schools under its jurisdiction to be informed of this order."</p>
<p>"This order is for compliance. In recent days, students from various schools have been holding national salvation movements. Now, during the winter defense season, local security is of utmost importance. It is sincerely feared that reactionary elements will take advantage of the opportunity to make trouble. Strict precautions should be taken to prevent any incidents. In addition to ordering the First Army Group Headquarters and the Guangdong Provincial Government, this order is hereby issued to the Provincial Government Headquarters, which should immediately comply and instruct the military and police under its jurisdiction to pay attention at all times and be well prepared, without the slightest negligence. Be sure. This order."</p>
<p>Chen Jitang issued a proclamation: "Now, I have received an order from the Southwest Political Affairs Council of the National Government, which states that the staff and students of various schools in this city are enthusiastic about national salvation and should be systematically organized. The Commander-in-Chief is instructed to send personnel to organize a national salvation volunteer corps and a national salvation nursing corps for strict training to fulfill their patriotic aspirations. Therefore, Garrison Commander Li Shuzong is immediately appointed as the concurrent Chief Commander to organize separately. At the same time, it is also ordered that Sun Yat-sen University in Shipai be temporarily used as the Headquarters and First Battalion Headquarters, Guangya Middle School be the Second Battalion Headquarters, and Municipal Second Middle School be the Third Battalion Headquarters (Nursing Corps). All enthusiastic patriotic staff and students are expected to register immediately to participate so that the organization can be established and training can be intensified, in order to unite together and alleviate the country's distress. This proclamation. Commander-in-Chief Chen Jitang." (Evening of January 10th)</p>

<p>Director Zhang of the Public Security Bureau stated that there are numerous private prostitutes in Suzhou, numbering several hundred, and there is a feeling that it is impossible to catch or punish them all. Therefore, a trial operation of public prostitutes is being implemented, divided into three classes. The first step of registration procedures has already been completed. Because there were more than 30 Minsheng Singing Girl Societies outside the city gate that were unwilling to obtain public prostitute licenses, it was delayed. County Magistrate Wu believed that the Minsheng Singing Girl Societies were nominally providing 清唱 (pure singing), but were in reality disguised private prostitutes. Therefore, on the 16th, he instructed the Public Security Bureau to order the Third Branch Bureau to revoke the licenses of the Minsheng Singing Girl Societies and dissolve them. At the same time, inspection matters are being actively handled, and it has been decided that public prostitutes will be established starting on March 1st.</p>

<p>祁雲龍 (Qi Yunlong), the county magistrate of this county, because opium addicts who had registered for reform during the registration period were still mostly hesitant, on the afternoon of the 14th, Magistrate Qi immediately took more than 30 convicted opium offenders, including three female offenders, wearing colorful paper high hats, and paraded them in teams through the city streets. Their faces were full of opium addiction, and they presented an ugly appearance. They were escorted by military police around the entire city so that unlicensed opium addicts could reform quickly.

It is expected to be fully restored to its original state starting on the 17th. The snow on the highways has been gradually melted away by the efforts of employees, and transportation has returned to normal today. In addition, the weather has been very cold in recent days. Three poor people were frozen to death in Hushu Sanguan Lane, Shihuiba Guandi Temple, Jianqiao, and other places the day before yesterday. The Hangzhou Local Court has sent personnel to investigate.

<p>The Daqiao ferry, traveling between Yin and Fenghua, set off from Ningbo to Fenghua on the evening of the 13th. Because it was the end of the lunar year, passengers were crowded. When the boat approached Tongpenpu, eight robbers who had been hiding on the boat suddenly appeared, brandishing wooden replica guns to silence any cries. One robber even took a kitchen knife from the boat and forced the passengers to hand over their silver dollars, rummaging through boxes and trunks. After about an hour of looting, they fired two shots and went ashore towards 社方面而去(the local association). The total loss is estimated at about seven or eight hundred yuan. Also, in Qingshuitan, a place in the Ruyayang Township of Xiangshan, there is a pavilion that is a place for resting for traveling merchants. On the morning of the 11th of this month, more than 40 traveling merchants passed by the place when three robbers suddenly appeared, each holding a handgun, and stopped them to rob them. It lasted for two hours before they left with the loot. The bandits fired several shots to show their power when they were leaving. The total amount of loot was more than 500 yuan.</p>

<p>— Zheng Hesheng, Full-time Editor and Compiler, National Institute for Compilation and Translation</p>
<p>Foreigners often say that the Chinese are like a sheet of loose sand. The Chinese people’s concept of the nation has always been like a sheet of loose sand, lacking a sense of national unity. However, besides the nation, there are very solid family and clan groups. The Premier believed that the relationship between the Chinese people and the structure of the nation starts with the family, then extends to the clan, and then to the nation, expanding step by step in an orderly manner. The relationship between large and small structures is very precious. He advocated using the clan as a unit, reforming its internal organization, and then uniting it into the nation. But how can we accomplish this unification and achieve the goal of "transforming the family into the nation?" Naturally, we need a sense of patriotism. To cultivate this sense of patriotism, on the one hand, we must break the bad habit of "not concerning oneself with matters outside one's position" and follow Mr. Gu Tinglin's legacy of "every individual is responsible for the rise and fall of the world." On the other hand, we must promote the glorious achievements in history and cultivate a sense of self-confidence to arouse feelings of love for the country. Since Emperor Huangdi founded the nation, we have had a long history and a significant culture. Since the late Qing Dynasty, we have mistakenly believed the slander of foreigners, believing that our people originated in the West, inevitably making us the laughingstock of forgetting our ancestors. Even more, some people consider Emperor Huangdi and Emperor Yao and Shun to be non-existent figures, and Emperor Yu to be an animal on the Nine Tripod Cauldrons, which is tantamount to destroying the glorious history of our ancestors. Now, to stimulate patriotic sentiment, we should promote the great spirit and foundation of our ancestors. In recent years, the central government has worshiped the Huangdi Mausoleum and Zhou Mausoleum, which is the intent.</p>
<p>The patriotic movement should be the responsibility of those in government, and the people of the whole country should share the responsibility. Once the country is in danger, those with knowledge should offer advice, those with money should contribute money, and those with strength should contribute strength. Regarding this fact, there are countless examples in national history. For example, during the Spring and Autumn period, when the State of Qi attacked the State of Lu, the people of Lu prepared to fight back. A man named Cao Gui requested to see the Duke of Lu. His fellow villagers advised him that those in positions of authority would have their own plans and that he should not interfere. Cao Gui did not listen and insisted on seeing the Duke, offering his plans and advice for the battle, which indeed resulted in a great victory. Also, when the people of Qin were about to attack the State of Zheng, they had already reached the border of Zheng, but the government of Zheng was still unaware. A merchant from Zheng named Xian Gao encountered them on the road and falsely claimed to be acting on the orders of the Duke of Zheng, using his own twelve oxen to reward the Qin soldiers and sending someone to inform the government to prepare for defense. The Qin general Meng Ming knew that the plan had failed and withdrew his troops. Furthermore, during the Han Dynasty, there was an entrepreneur in Henan named Bu Shi, who originally became wealthy by herding sheep. At this time, Emperor Wu of Han was about to attack the Xiongnu. Bu Shi volunteered to donate half of his wealth to help the government in its efforts on the border. The government wanted him to become an official, but he refused, and when asked about his purpose in donating his wealth, he stated that the country was now going to fight the Xiongnu, and the virtuous should sacrifice their lives and those with wealth should contribute money so that the Xiongnu could be destroyed! When we look at the patriotic fervor of these ancestors, we can understand the source of victory for the states at that time. When we lecture on national history, we should make every effort to elaborate on these types of facts. Our country is now in a situation of internal and external troubles converging upon us. The divergence of opinions in national administration and the weakness of the people's patriotic thoughts are all reasons for the potential downfall of the nation. How should we remedy this? The cause and effect of rise, fall, governance, and chaos in history are clearly visible. Our country should conduct detailed research on this to cultivate the people's concept of patriotism. This is a small responsibility of our academic and educational circles to protect the country.</p>
<p>We should study the truth of society. The teaching of history should naturally focus on the rise and fall of the nation and the country, but at the same time, we must understand the truth of society to lay the foundation for transformation and advancement. Because the entire history, in addition to a few leaders, is entrusted to and contains the potential social forces of the majority of ordinary people. Therefore, discussing the traces of social evolution and the problems of today's society is not only the key point of research for sociologists, but also the focus of historians. In Chinese history, the center of records has always been great figures such as dynasties, emperors, generals, and so on, and no attention has been paid to the changes in the entire society and the rise and fall of the entire culture. In fact, not only is this the case in China, but Western historians in the past also advocated that the deeds of great men represent the entire history. For example, Carlyle's statement that "history is the biography of great men" can be regarded as the representative of this school of historical views. In his book "Heroes and Hero Worship," he elaborates on great men such as gods, emperors, religious figures, priests, writers, and poets, believing that their thrilling achievements left in the world are what formed the majority of history. It was not until the middle of the eighteenth century that a historian named Voltaire included the entire social life of an era in the scope of history. In his book "The Century of Louis XIV," the chapter on customs describes the moral, social, economic, artistic, and literary life of Europe from Shaliman to Louis XIII, which can be called the first work to produce a true history of civilization. Since then, there have been many Western historians who have paid attention to social history, which is innumerable.</p>
<p>Since the introduction of the new Western historiography into China, people have begun to pay attention to the study of social history. In 1922, the Chinese Educational Improvement Society held a meeting, and Mr. Liang Rengong proposed a "Transformation of Secondary School National History Textbooks" case. He believed that the current textbooks were all political in nature, but political history cannot include the entire history. Old-style political history focuses only on the rise and fall of dynasties and wars, and the changes in political trends cannot be explained. Although social and cultural matters are occasionally described after each dynasty, they are too brief and not coherent. Due to this shortcoming, students cannot get a clear impression of the work of their ancestors after receiving national history education, so they cannot develop a deep love for their motherland. Its faults are that the historical events taught are too far away from modern life, causing students to split their learning and life into two halves. Furthermore, the political phenomena that have changed little over the years are full of deceit and darkness, and students will only increase their conservatism or other bad habits when they read it, which is contrary to the education of democratic governance, and for these reasons, students not only cannot develop interest in the subject of national history, but also tend to dislike it. In order to correct inherent shortcomings and meet the new requirements of the times, Mr. Liang advocated replacing political history with cultural history. At the same time, Mr. He Bocheng also had a proposal: "The editing or lecturing of history should be based on explaining the evolution of social conditions in past dynasties so that students can understand how the current situation has evolved." The reason for his proposal is that the scope of history is very wide, and the materials are very complicated. If facts are researched only for the sake of facts, then it will be too difficult to start. Because the materials are complicated, it is not easy to choose them. In the primary and secondary schools, the teaching time of history is very limited. If only adults and major events are described, it is just like volcanoes and oceans are not enough to represent geography, and tigers and leopards are not enough to represent zoology. If a method of quoting out of context is used, then the history compiled or lectured will inevitably have no clear purpose due to different subjective views. In order to facilitate the selection of materials, there should be a certain standard when editing or lecturing history. The purpose of history is to enable students to understand how the current situation has evolved, otherwise the effect of history will not be obvious. In order to achieve this purpose, attention should be paid to the evolution of social conditions. This kind of proposal is the beginning of the creation of new historiography in our country, but this kind of historical work with social activities as the main body has not yet been published, which shows that this kind of attempt is not easy.</p>
<p>Regarding the study of social evolution, there are naturally many difficulties. Mr. He has already conducted detailed research on this issue. He said: "We have two particularly difficult areas in our research on the history of society: one is the material problem, and the other is the compilation problem. From the perspective of materials: first, the materials on social history are very lacking. For example, our Chinese Twenty-Four Histories can be regarded as a voluminous work, but there are very few materials on general society. Second, because of the lack of materials, we are often prone to making mistakes in our research on a social history, such as missing one or ignoring the whole. Third, fundamentally, most of the materials on social history are records of others, not obtained from our own observations. If we want to use them, we must first solve the various problems of their authenticity and errors. From the perspective of compilation: first, the scope of research is not easy to determine. It is very difficult for us to determine the extent to which a certain social phenomenon is popular in the entire society or only in a part of it. Second, the types of phenomena are not easily distinguished. A phenomenon often looks like politics on the surface, but in fact it is due to economic motives. There are also those that obviously belong to religion on the surface, but in fact their motives lie in politics. Therefore, it is not easy to distinguish which social phenomenon is a purely political phenomenon and which phenomenon is a purely economic phenomenon. Third, because it is difficult to distinguish the types of various phenomena, it is very difficult for us to study the causal relationship between them in various social movements. The causes of political movements are not necessarily in politics, and the causes of economic movements are not necessarily in the economy. There are many interactive and complex relationships that cannot be seen on the surface alone. Mr. He's remarks are indeed the truth that he has spoken after studying social history. We acknowledge that the study of social history is more difficult than any other part of history, and especially if we want to study Chinese social history, but we should find ways to break through these difficulties. As for the purpose of studying social history, it is naturally to understand the truth of social culture, because now the general public does not understand the situation of their own country's society too much, and they are very estranged from their own culture. If they want to reform society and promote culture, they have no basis, and since the import of Eastern and Western cultures, they have been imitating blindly, often losing their inherent features and falling into a state of chaos. In our study of the social history of our country, we should discuss the social organization, social customs, social economy, etc. in detail. As for our country's inherent culture, such as the system of philosophy and ethics, the trends of literary novels, and the inventions of science and architecture, etc., we must also make a comparative study, so that we can have a clear understanding of our country's social culture, and based on these studies, we can carry out transformation and promotion, and naturally achieve the spirit of promoting the nation or the country. I hope that we will make every effort to gradually complete it.</p>
<p>In summary, in teaching national history in primary and secondary schools, we should have a consistent proposition on society, the country, and the nation, that is, to focus on the training of citizens. As Mr. Fu Mengzhen said, use historical facts as role models to inspire patriotism, national upward mobility, discipline, national resilience, forward-looking enlightenment, public morality requirements, and nation-building role models. Using historical descriptions is more practical and moving than using empty words. The educational authorities have declared that the purpose of secondary school teaching is to cultivate healthy citizens and make them the backbone of the Chinese national organization, and its content is the full cultivation of scientific knowledge and the strict training of national morality, so that those who receive secondary school education have a complete foundation whether they study academic subjects or serve society. This course of history is a tool for training national morality, but here there is one point that should be noted, that is, the compilation or lecturing of teaching materials should focus on positive encouragement, not negative pessimism; should focus on effective encouragement, not superficial stimulation; should focus on the truth of facts, not blind propaganda; should focus on the research of truth, not false illusions; should focus on practical theory, not extravagant desires; and strive to make students have a righteous and bright attitude, a firm and unyielding spirit, and become healthy citizens. If we can inspire students' determination to love society, love the country, and love the nation through historical education, and thus extend it to people from all walks of life, catch up and save the country from disaster, then the teaching of national history in primary and secondary schools will have a successful hope, completed.</p>

<h3 id="e101">Passengers Carrying Silver Coins at the Station Should Exchange Them for Legal Tender at the Ticket Office. The Limit for Carrying Silver Coins Is 300. Those Exceeding the Limit Must Obtain a Passport; Otherwise, It Will Be Considered Smuggling. <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance, based on a request from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, requested separate instructions to be issued to the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway stations and wharves regarding the exemption from seizure of silver coins and subsidiary silver coins that cannot be exchanged for legal tender. At the same time, a concise proclamation of the enacted methods for exchanging legal tender was issued to ensure widespread knowledge and avoid being treated unjustly. The Ministry of Finance replied yesterday, stating, "Received. Previously, reports indicated that local military police were not clear about the intentions of the regulations and often made things difficult for ignorant people carrying small amounts of coins. The Ministry telegraphed all provinces, cities, and military agencies on [Date] of December 1935, instructing local military police not to confiscate silver coins carried by people from areas where legal tender is not circulating, but to instruct recipients to send them to nearby exchange agencies for exchange into legal tender. Those ignorant people who are not aware of the government orders and carry silver coins should be immediately instructed to go to the nearest exchange agency and exchange them for legal tender. In order to exchange legal tender, there should not be any interception on the way, so as to cause disturbances. If there is any deliberate violation, people should be allowed to accuse and strictly investigate. Those who deliberately conceal and intend to smuggle or collect, transport, and profit for personal gain should be strictly punished according to the law once discovered. Passengers on ships who use silver coins to purchase tickets or carry silver coins outside of the prohibited price should be instructed to hand them over to the ship's accounting office to exchange for legal tender. This Ministry has also separately instructed the Ministry of Communications and the Chief Inspector of Customs to instruct them to comply. In addition, the number of silver coins that passengers are allowed to carry was approved in September 1934. Each passenger is allowed to carry silver coins. If they are not of inferior quality, whether single or double, merchants are allowed to transport them freely within 300 coins. If the above number is exceeded, a passport must be obtained; otherwise, it will be treated as smuggling and confiscated. All these are on file. If the stations encounter passengers carrying silver coins, they should notify the passengers in accordance with the above-mentioned methods and hand over all the silver coins for purchasing tickets, or more than three hundred silver coins and double coins outside the ticket price, to the ticket office of the station for exchange into legal tender. The station will then issue separate receipts for the silver coins used by passengers to purchase tickets, and for the silver coins exchanged for legal tender in addition to the ticket price, and send them to the nearby legal tender exchange agency for exchange into legal tender. If station staff take the opportunity to attempt to smuggle or collect, transport, and profit for personal gain, they should be severely punished according to the law once discovered. In addition to consulting the Ministry of Railways to instruct the various railway bureaus to comply, and to announce it at each station, please inform and circulate this notification."</p>
<h3 id="e102">Transportation of Legal Tender Should Be Facilitated to the Greatest Extent Possible. No Need to Check the Voucher for Transporting Public Goods. The Ministry Orders the Railway Bureau to Comply. <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>According to the Shenshi News Agency, regarding the transportation of silver legal tender on state-owned railways and ships, the Executive Yuan of the National Government previously decided that state-owned railways and ships should charge 50% of the fee for transporting public goods for the transportation of silver legal tender, except for those that are transported free of charge by the Central Bank, etc. The Ministry has ordered all railways to comply. Subsequently, the Traffic Departments of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus inquired whether it was necessary to check the voucher for transporting public goods, or whether they could simply charge 50% of the fee. The Ministry issued Order No. 591, stating that legal tender should be facilitated to the greatest extent possible. The reporting procedures should still be handled according to the usual practices of each railway, and there is no need for the Ministry to issue a voucher for convenience. However, the transportation of silver should still require verification of a passport or certificate before it can be accepted. After receiving the order, the two railway bureaus have instructed the Traffic Department to comply.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Silver Industry to Form a Committee to Study Lowering Interest Rates. The Decisive Issue Is Lowering Deposit Interest Rates. <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>After Yu Qiaqing, Liu Hongsheng, Guo Shun, Rong Zongjing, Nie Lusheng, and others submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance to lower interest rates and help the real economy, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Silver Industry Association were all instructed by the Ministry to handle the matter. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from the Silver Industry Association yesterday that the Silver Industry Association has decided to hold a joint meeting after the general conclusion of each industry in 1935 to discuss specific measures. The decisive issue in lowering loan interest rates is lowering deposit interest rates. Because the loans of the silver industry all come from absorbing deposits. If the loan interest rate is only lowered, but the deposit interest rate is not lowered, it will not be possible to operate the business. Although the deposit interest rates of various banks and money houses are not the same, the highest interest rate of foreign banks is 5%, the highest annual interest rate of Chinese banks is 10%, and the highest monthly interest rate of money houses is 10%. As for the loan interest rates, the lowest interest rate of foreign banks, Chinese banks, and money houses is 6%, and the highest is 12-13%, which depends on the money market. In case it is implemented, there should be remedies for established deposits and loans. Therefore, it is heard that the Silver Industry Association will organize a specialized committee for specific research at the joint meeting.</p>

<h3 id="e105">1935 Financial Report of Two Railways. Net Profit Estimated at Over 1.75 Million Yuan. Year-End Bonus of One Month's Salary Given to Employees with Preference. <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the issuance of the 1935 year-end bonus for the two railways, the Railway Bureau had previously listed a calculation table and submitted it to the Ministry for issuance. The Ministry of Railways issued Instruction No. 146, stating, "Received the submission and attached table. The net profit of the railway for 1935 is estimated at over 1.75 million yuan. According to regulations, 20% of the net profit is allocated as a bonus, which would only be enough to issue slightly more than half a month's salary. However, considering that the employees of the railway have been diligent in their service, the employee bonus for this year is approved to be issued as one month's salary with preference, as a special encouragement. However, this should not be taken as an example in the future. The bonus should still be issued after considering financial resources and must not be raised by borrowing money. The rest should be handled in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry's Instructions No. 2896 and 2897 of 1929. In addition to having been notified by telegram in advance, this order is reissued for compliance." It is noted that this bonus was approved by the Ministry's telegram in advance, and the accounting department was instructed to comply, ensuring that it is issued before January 20.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Municipal Government Proclamation: Assisting Cotton Merchants with Registration. <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Sub-Office of the Central Cotton Adulteration and Mixing Prohibition Office previously handled the registration of cotton merchants in this city in accordance with regulations for statistical purposes. However, some cotton merchants, being ignorant, refused to register. Although urged, they still delayed. The sub-office then requested the Central Office to forward a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Government, requesting assistance in handling the matter. Yesterday, the Municipal Government issued a proclamation stating, "Based on the official letter from the Cotton Industry Control Committee of the National Economic Council and the Central Cotton Adulteration and Mixing Prohibition Office, it is stated that the director of the Shanghai Sub-Office, Tang Dongshan, reported that since the establishment of the office on October 16, it has been handling the registration of cotton merchants and the inspection of cotton in Dongjiapo, Zhoujiaqiao, Beixinjing, Donggou, Wusong, and other places. Most local cotton farmers and merchants have complied with the cotton merchant registration regulations and the prohibition regulations, as well as the inspection methods. However, some people have shown stubborn resistance and disregarded the law. If this continues without rectification, it will inevitably hinder the entire prohibition work. Therefore, it is proposed to request your office to send a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Government to issue a notice, earnestly informing all cotton farmers and merchants to register in accordance with the regulations and submit to inspection, and to instruct the Public Security Bureau to order all sub-bureaus and police stations to do their best to assist in order to reduce resistance and facilitate progress. Based on this, it is found that the Jiangsu Provincial Districts and the Shanghai Municipal District Cotton Merchant Registration and Inspection Methods have been sent to your Municipal Government for promulgation and instructed the Public Security Bureau to effectively assist the sub-office in carrying out cotton merchant registration. In view of the previous situation, in addition to instructions, a corresponding letter is sent, hoping that you will review and issue several proclamations so that all cotton farmers and merchants will comply with the regulations for registration and await inspection by the sub-office. Also, please instruct the Public Security Bureau and its sub-bureaus to provide effective assistance at all times to facilitate implementation. Based on this, it is found that the cotton merchant registration methods and inspection methods in this municipal district have been promulgated by this government and the bureau has been instructed to assist. Now, based on the previous situation, in addition to issuing an order to the Public Security Bureau and replying by letter, a proclamation is jointly issued, instructing all cotton farmers and merchants in the city to register in accordance with the regulations and await inspection by the sub-office, and not to delay. Strictly enforce this proclamation."</p>
<h3 id="e107">Jiangsu Province National Goods Factories Association: This Year's Central Work is to Petition the Government to Lower Interest Rates to Reduce Burden and to Broadly Accept Inland Real Estate Mortgages as Collateral <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Qian Chengxu, Director-General of the China Industrial Federation, attended the Jiangsu Provincial National Goods Factories Association cadre meeting in Changzhou a few days ago and has since returned to Shanghai. A reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency met with Mr. Qian at the association's Shanghai office yesterday morning, and he provided detailed information on the association's central work. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Meeting Process</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial National Goods Factories Association held a cadre meeting in Changzhou. More than ten people attended, including Hu Xiyuan, Xue Mingjian, Liu Guojun, Qian Chengxu, Liu Piji, Ding Zhixiang, Jiang Shangda, and Pan Guojun. Under the chairmanship of Xue Mingjian, it was resolved to revise the organizational charter, changing the director system to a committee system. Qian Chengxu, Xue Mingjian, Liu Piji, Ding Zhixiang, and Pan Guojun were appointed as standing committee members, forming a presidium to jointly assume external responsibilities. In addition, several important proposals, including the central work for this year, were decided upon.</p>
<p>Central Work</p>
<p>As for the association's central work for this year, it was decided that each member should be practically responsible and work hard, avoiding empty talk and striving for practicality. Starting from February 1st of this year, an investigation into the import of goods in various localities will be launched immediately. It is expected that this work will be completed within four months. The next step will be to statistically categorize the findings based on the nature and type of goods. If foreign goods are only slightly used, efforts will be made to design alternatives for factories or shops to replace them with national goods, gradually cultivating the public's love and use of national goods. In addition, more than ten letters have been sent to the relevant industry authorities of various countries, asking about the methods used in those countries to promote national goods, as a reference for our promotion of national goods.</p>
<p>Rescuing National Goods</p>
<p>The association, in view of the recent two years of increasing foreign goods flooding the inland, especially in the Su-Chang area, which has gradually become a center for foreign goods dumping due to convenient transportation, although there are many yarn and cloth factories in Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, and other places, a large amount of foreign cotton cloth is still imported. In order to rescue the production and sales of national goods, this year has been designated as the "National Goods Year." The association is determined to fully support the development of national goods and adopt dumping methods to compete with foreign goods. The association has also submitted a petition to the provincial government, requesting the establishment of an industrial management committee within the Construction Bureau to be specifically responsible for maintaining industry.</p>
<p>Requesting Interest Reduction</p>
<p>Chinese factories face difficulties in competing with foreign goods due to excessive interest burdens and increased costs. For example, foreign-owned yarn factories in China borrow money from their domestic banks at interest rates of only 3.5% to 4%. Assuming that 20-count yarn is the standard, the interest burden per package of yarn is only three or four yuan. However, Chinese-owned yarn factories often pay interest rates of more than 1% per month for year-round loans. During the particularly urgent financial situation last year, the interest burden per package of yarn reached as high as sixteen or seventeen yuan. Although the government has already complied with the requests of the industrial sector and has clearly ordered interest rate reductions, there is still no definite method for reducing interest rates. Therefore, the association is submitting a petition requesting the government to promptly announce the method for reducing interest rates in order to benefit Jiangsu's industries.</p>
<p>Collateral Activities</p>
<p>The government's recently announced financial activities measures also include real estate mortgages as one of the ways to stimulate activity. However, the meaning of "real estate" primarily focuses on Shanghai real estate. As a result, Shanghai's land prices may increase, and cash from the interior will still flow into the city. Therefore, the focus of "real estate" should be inland real estate to avoid imbalances. The association is planning to submit a petition to the government, requesting that matters relating to real estate mortgages should start from inland real estate. In short, the difficulties currently experienced by industrial production in China are not limited to the above points, but they are urgently in need of resolution.</p>

If there is a good solution, we will definitely do our best to implement it."</p>

<p>Sheng Takes Office as Director of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Unified Tax Bureau: Sheng Shengyi arrived at the bureau at 10:00 AM yesterday to take office. He summoned all the bureau's staff to hold an inauguration ceremony in the bureau's auditorium.

<h3 id="e115">With the Total Closing Period Approaching, Money Shops Provide Flexible Overdrafts and Change to Term Loans Based on Credit of Each Account; All Industries Applying for Loans Hope for Quick Approval and Release <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The total closing period for various industries in the 24th year of the Republic of China is approaching. Money shops are extending office hours and providing special flexibility for overdrafts for various industries, changing to term loans. Banks and money shops are busy collecting and settling accounts. Various industries hope that the Loan Committee will generously approve the credit loans that have been applied for. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Special Flexibility: After the start of the total closing period for the 24th year, money shops will urge the return of overdrafts for various accounts, requiring them to be cleared before the 23rd and the deposit books returned. After the total closing, the money shops will distribute the deposit books. However, after the approval of the 18 million loan from the Central, China, and Communications Banks, the money shops are providing special flexibility to various accounts, allowing them to change the overdraft amount to term credit loans or term mortgage loans based on the creditworthiness of each account. The term is usually one or two months. These procedures are being handled these days.</p>
<p>Busy Collecting and Settling Accounts: With the total closing period approaching, banks and money shops have extended their office hours. The time is determined by each bank's and money shop's accounts. The money shops have decided to extend the ticket collection time to 5:00 PM starting from the 19th, and the ticket return time is extended by one hour compared to the past. Banks and money shops are very busy collecting and settling accounts. The money market's foreign exchange rate yesterday was still eight cents per thousand yuan per day. Money shops will be closed for four days from the 24th to sort everything out. Banks will be closed for three days from the 24th, called the Spring Holiday.</p>
<p>Various Industries Request Loans: The 15th and 36th sub-branches of the Citizens' Federation sent a joint letter to the Loan Committee yesterday, which reads: "To Chairman Cai Zengji and all members of the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Loan Committee: Shanghai's various industries are declining and on the verge of collapse, suffering from a lack of funds and unable to cope. Your committee, witnessing the difficult times and addressing the root cause, has taken the initiative to provide loans, for which all our merchants are deeply grateful. Now that the total closing of the old calendar is approaching in the blink of an eye, the economic exhaustion of Shanghai merchants, who have no way to raise funds, relies solely on the loans from your committee as the only way out, hoping to cope with the difficult times and seek development. Your committee is in charge of the important task of loans, and you must have observed the situation. However, it is heard that there are still hundreds of loan applications from merchants that have been investigated and completed but have not been approved by the meeting. Furthermore, it is heard that there is no plan to convene a regular meeting to approve loans before the total closing period. The news has spread and the public is panicked. If this is true, thousands of merchants in the city may be forced to close down due to poor turnover, and the impact is worrying. It will not only create a major economic panic in the commercial market, but the society will also be shaken and uneasy. Our sub-branches are deeply concerned and dare to send this urgent telegram, requesting your committee to approve the various applications that have been investigated and completed, or are being investigated, as soon as possible before the total closing of the old calendar, and to release the loans immediately to relieve the urgent need and overcome the difficulties.

We await your orders with urgency."</p>
<h3 id="e116">National Mining Federation Petitions to Reduce Coal and Coke Freight Rates on the Pinghan Railway <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The Mining Federation of the Republic of China submitted separate petitions yesterday to the Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, Ministry of Industry, and Ministry of Railways, which read: "Regarding the case of the mines along the Pinghan Railway previously requesting the reduction of coal and coke freight rates on the line to reduce costs and provide relief, please quickly examine the original petition and order its implementation. Respectfully request your consideration. We respectfully note that the current coal freight rates of various railways under the Ministry are the highest on the Pinghan Railway. The coal mines along the line have suffered from war disasters, frequent bandits, transportation obstructions, and rising prices of labor and materials since the 15th year of the Republic of China. In addition, the dumping of foreign coal and the depression of the market have resulted in deepening losses and have long been on the verge of bankruptcy. Although they have each maintained, reduced staff and salaries, strictly implemented austerity measures, improved projects, and saved waste in order to reduce costs and strive for recovery, their efforts have been exhausted, and the situation is getting worse. Not only is there no improvement, but it is also becoming increasingly dangerous. The main reason is that the Pinghan Railway's freight is too high, increasing costs. Even if there is coal, it is difficult to transport and sell, and inventories are piled up, waiting to die. They look at each other with sorrow and do not know what to do. Last November, the Zhongfu, Lincheng, Jingxing Zhengfeng, Liuhegou, Yili, Hongfu, Datong, Gaoxian, Xingbao, Mentougou, Zhongxing, and other coal mining companies jointly submitted a petition and elected representatives to attend the Fifth National Congress of the Kuomintang, pleading in unison, and submitted separate petitions to Your Yuan (Your Ministry), requesting compassion for commercial difficulties and ordering the Pinghan Railway Bureau to temporarily collect the new thirty-two coal freight rates at half price, or to cancel them and revise a practical and fair freight rate in proportion to the market coal price to provide relief. The original petitions from the companies are pressing and have been considered. However, nearly two months have passed without a clear indication. The mines are looking forward to it as if hoping for rain. They do not dare to bother again. The association's purpose is related to the entire national mining industry, and the public's interests are at stake. Without presuming, we specially continue to express the sincerity of the companies. We respectfully believe that Your Excellency (arriving new) is wise and that coal is the mother of various industries, needed for national defense, and beneficial for the people's livelihood. With broad planning, you will immediately implement a protection policy. We respectfully request that you examine the original petitions of the companies and order (order the Ministry of Railways to implement) (consult the Ministry of Railways) to promptly revise the Pinghan Railway's coal and coke freight rates to be lighter and order the railway to implement them, so that the coal mines along the line can open up sales channels and celebrate their recovery. Hoping for good news, we cannot express our prayers enough."</p>

<h3 id="e121">Representatives of Merchants and Citizens from Fourteen Counties in Henan Province Come to Shanghai to Petition for the Abolition of Oppressive Taxes on Huai Salt; After Petitioning the Salt Affairs Administration, They Will Go to Nanjing Again <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The people of fourteen counties in the former Ruyang region of Henan Province, as well as Gushi, Huangchuan, Guangshan, Shangcheng, and Xixian counties, are all in the sales area for Huai salt. However, due to the heavy and miscellaneous taxes, merchants and citizens cannot bear the burden. Now that the border area between Henan and Anhui provinces has gradually been pacified, these oppressive taxes still exist in a disguised form. Therefore, merchants and citizens from fourteen counties have specially sent representatives, such as Zhou Longguang, to Shanghai yesterday, intending to petition the Salt Affairs Administration and then go to Nanjing again to petition the Ministry of Finance. The text of their petition is recorded as follows: "For the purpose of petitioning for the urgent implementation of the new salt law to relieve the disaster-stricken people and benefit the people's livelihood, the Huai salt transportation and sales Yinan, Ruguan and other fourteen counties, in addition to the unified tax at that time, did not have any additional taxes, which benefited both national planning and the people's livelihood. Since Mr. Zhao supervised Henan, taxes were first set up in Sanhejian, named salt increment price, followed by named food household donation, setting up cards to collect taxes, which was extremely oppressive. The people, under the power of lust, had no appeal. Fortunately, the Northern Expedition was completed, and the National Government, in the 19th year, issued a general order that salt increment was national revenue and should be uniformly collected by the Ministry of Finance. Local governments may not set up other names to collect additional taxes, and military and political leaders of all provinces should notify their subordinates that they must never establish any names under the salt increment project to collect additional taxes, etc. All our people are deeply grateful. Afterwards, the establishment of a sales supervision office in Sanhejian, Henan Province, was originally to compensate for the insufficiency of tax revenue, which was a temporary expedient, and then changed to a salt affairs tax bureau. However, the Huai salt is taxed at the place of origin in Haizhou, at a rate of four yuan per Zu. After Anhui Province adds one yuan and five corners, the Sanhejian Tax Bureau, only one river away, adds another one yuan and five corners, which is not equal treatment. In addition, according to the market scale, each load of salt is calculated at more than nine foreign yuan. Comparing the past and the present, the disparity is more than ten times. Moreover, the tax bureau sends teams to combat smuggling, harassing everywhere. Whenever they arrive at the market town, they are armed with guns, as if facing an enemy. The Gushi incident of killing civilians has not yet been resolved. The representatives humbly believe that the Sanhejian tax bureau is oppressing and harassing the people and is not conducive to national use. It really goes against the authorities' intention to reform the salt administration. Moreover, Gushi is located in the border area of ​​three provinces and has been ravaged by bandits and communists. In addition, there are floods and droughts, and the starving are full of the fields. The survivors of the catastrophe are waiting to be rescued. Regarding salt, how can we burden our people again? The representatives read in the newspaper that the Fifth Plenary Session of the Fifth National Congress proposed four cases for the implementation of the new salt law, which have been sent to the Resolutions Committee and should be considered for a comprehensive solution. For this reason, we request the urgent implementation of the new salt law and the elimination of the Sanhejian Tax Bureau, in order to relieve the disaster-stricken people and benefit the people's livelihood. We are afraid and await orders. Respectfully submitted to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance of the National Government."</p>

<p>Since the Shanghai County smoker self-renewal registration began at the start of this month, registrations have been quite enthusiastic. The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs specially dispatched inspector Mr. Wei Zhiqi to Shanghai to guide everything. Mr. Wei arrived in Shanghai from Zhenjiang yesterday morning and immediately met with the county magistrate of Shanghai County, Mr. Ye Zhendong, to discuss the overall inspection and implementation methods after the smoker self-renewal registration. Mr. Wei plans to stay in Shanghai for two or three days before proceeding to Chuansha County to continue providing guidance. According to a recent conversation with County Magistrate Ye by a Daily News reporter, most of the Shanghai jurisdiction is rural, so there are not many smokers. As of now, only one hundred people have registered. Even when the registration period ends at the end of this month, there will be only about two hundred people, he said.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Yuyao: Salt Merchant Representatives Remain in Shanghai to Petition <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Around 11 a.m. the day before yesterday, salt merchant representatives Shang Cai Su and others continued to petition the General Office of Salt Affairs Inspection. They were received by Chief Inspector Feng. Details have already been reported in the press. The original petition is now transcribed below: It is submitted to request strict orders to be followed by wealthy merchants who are disobeying orders and delaying, to fully collect the quota in order to save the remaining breath of the salt farmers. Yuyao salt merchant Tu Tiren (also known as Shou Shan) manages the public granaries of the five districts, Gong Xing, Yuan Tai, and is coordinating a price reduction and suspension of collection in the granaries of eastern Zhejiang. Moreover, he has deceptively obtained approval from the Transportation Office to collect salt at a 60% rate. After repeated appeals from the representatives, the Ministry issued Order No. 1465 on December 14th of the 20th year of the Republic of China to the Salt Affairs Office of Liangzhe, instructing them to immediately respond by collecting the full quota and restoring the full collection of bundles to facilitate transportation and sales, without allowing any delays, etc. The Transportation Office also issued an order to the Yuyao field, which Field Director Zuo reiterated to promptly collect the full amount of salt and to ensure that the quota is collected in full within the year, without any delays, etc. Upon receiving this order, the granary merchant should immediately comply and fully collect the quota, so that the impoverished salt farmers struggling to survive at the end of the year can maintain their livelihoods. However, in January of this year, granary merchant Wang Shou Shan announced, "This granary, due to excessive production and sluggish sales, with difficult turnover, has had to temporarily suspend collection. Subsequently, we received an order from the Liangzhe Transportation Envoy Office instructing us to reduce the collection to 60% of the original quota from July of this year to provide relief. This granary, in order to uphold the government's policy and consider the people's livelihood, has repeatedly made efforts and reluctantly complied. Half a year has passed since the opening of collection. Currently, the sluggish sales show no hope, and financial exhaustion makes it difficult to maintain. However, because the end of the year is approaching and the livelihoods of the salt farmers are at stake, this granary, despite the great difficulties, will still try its best to comply with the order and collect the 60% quota first. We earnestly hope that all salt farmers will hand in their 60% quota and receive their salt money to safely pass the new year. As for restoring the remaining 40%, it is a separate matter. The granary merchant is also preparing to find another solution, considering all aspects and cooperating fully to resolve it as soon as possible. We hope you will not easily believe rumors, which will only cause more disputes and do no good, only increasing losses. Please pay attention," etc. His defiance of orders and refusal to immediately restore the full quota is simply aimed at taking advantage of the lunar new year to oppress the salt farmers beyond the already reduced price of eight jiao, reducing it even further. The intention is clear. The order from the Ministry is to fully collect the quota and restore the full collection of bundles. The field order also stipulates that the so-called restoration of the full quota within the year means continuing the full quota of the 24th year of the Republic of China without any doubt. However, the merchant's announcement says it is another matter and that he is preparing to find another solution, his tactics of delaying becoming increasingly sophisticated. The salt farmers, with their food and clothing almost exhausted, are in dire straits, and the situation is extremely dangerous and difficult to suppress. The representatives have exhausted their voices and efforts, unable to persuade them. Therefore, they have rushed to your office again, unable to prepare a written report, and on the 7th of this month, they personally requested that the merchant be strictly ordered to comply with the previous order. A representative was assigned to receive them. Given that the Ministry's order has already been sent to the Transportation Office, we still beg you to strictly order the Yuyao field to supervise and urge the granary merchant to comply with the order and make up the full quota of the 24th year of the Republic of China to save the remaining breath of the salt farmers. We are extremely anxious and await your orders. Respectfully submitted to Zhu Yun, Director of the General Office of Salt Affairs Inspection and Director of the Salt Affairs Office.</p>

The viewers were endless, and details have been reported in previous newspapers.

The grand opening is scheduled for 9 a.m. on the 20th of this month, lasting for two weeks.</p>
<p>The collection of aviation patriotic funds from the freight truck industry has been very successful since it began on July 1st of last year. The original regulation stipulated a monthly donation of six yuan per vehicle. The industry association requested a change due to the economic downturn and poor business. From January, the donation was reduced by two yuan. The General Team Office, in consideration of the merchants' difficulties, approved the change. Recently, various trucking companies have been crowding to the office and association to pay their donations, with over a hundred cases daily.</p>

<p>Since the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Workers' Union has been reorganized by the Municipal Party Department, all union affairs have been actively reorganized. The Reorganization Committee, to protect the due interests of workers, has specifically sent letters to the managers of all pharmacies in the city.

<p>Mr. Yu Jiesan, from Northeast China, has invented a chemical fire extinguishing powder. After obtaining patent rights approved by the Ministry of Industry, he has now transported the product to Shanghai. He immediately sought assistance from the Municipal Social Bureau and the Public Security Bureau to conduct a public test at the Nanshi Fangxie Road Public Stadium this afternoon at 3 p.m. The fire extinguishing effectiveness of this newly invented chemical powder will be demonstrated. At the same time, Yu and others, in the name of the Zhengda Fire Extinguisher South China General Distribution Office, issued invitations, inviting people from all walks of life to visit and observe. Due to winter defense concerns, the Public Security Bureau and the Security Office plan to dispatch police and soldiers to the scene for protection. Therefore, those from all walks of life who wish to visit and observe should first obtain admission tickets from the third floor of No. 39 Jixiang Street in the French Concession for due diligence. It is reported that during this afternoon's test, kerosene and pine wood will be used as fuel. When applying the powder, it will be applied after the flames have burned to an extremely fierce degree, and the fire extinguishing powder, weighing less than three pounds, will be used to extinguish the fire in one fell swoop. As a result, the municipal government and the Public Security Bureau attach great importance to this invention.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Military Affairs believes that coal gas vehicles are extremely important for national defense transportation. Therefore, on the 13th of this month, the Transportation Corps conducted a coal gas vehicle test. The vehicles being tested were the Lihe Dauntless brand coal gas passenger car from the Hankou China Coal Gas Engine Factory, with a load capacity of one and a half tons; the Chevrolet brand coal gas truck from the Shanghai Zhongming Second Factory, with a load capacity of one and a half tons; and the General Motors brand coal gas truck from the China Coal Gas Vehicle Company, with a load capacity of three tons. The main tester was German consultant Roman, along with several people including Transportation Corps technicians Shen Yunshan and Peng Hao, and Ordnance Department technician Hu Zongpu. On the 13th, the vehicles' mechanical components and load capacities were inspected in Nanjing. On the morning of the 14th, they departed from Nanjing for Shanghai. The weather was a mix of rain and snow, resulting in poor road conditions and strong winds. As a result, the China vehicle performed the best, arriving in Shanghai at 9 p.m. that day without any malfunctions along the way. The China Lihe vehicle broke down in Changshu at 12 p.m. the following morning due to a coal gas malfunction, so it switched to gasoline to drive to Shanghai. The Zhongming vehicle also broke down, arriving at 2 p.m. the following afternoon. It also switched to gasoline in Yixing due to a coal gas malfunction. It is reported that the China and Zhongming vehicles, after being repaired, will still travel from Shanghai to Nanjing via Hangzhou in the near future for another decisive test.</p>

<h3 id="e138">Rickshaw Puller Suspected of Collusion in Robbery by Taking Small Roads <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Chen Longheng, a 30-year-old man from Ningbo, works for an oil company and lives at No. 8 Pude Lane, Menghua Street. Yesterday morning at 6 a.m., he arrived in Shanghai from Ningbo on the new Beijing steamship. At the pier, he hired a rickshaw pulled by Qi Youshan from Yancheng to go home. The rickshaw puller did not go west on Tongming Avenue but took small roads, circling around to the vicinity of Jingye Lane, Jukui Street, inside the Little East Gate. Suddenly, a bandit grabbed a呢帽 hat worth over ten yuan from Chen's head from behind the rickshaw and fled. Chen ordered Qi to stop the rickshaw, intending to chase after the bandit, but Qi pretended not to know and ran away. Chen jumped off the rickshaw and reported the incident to policeman Liu Wenhan, accusing the rickshaw puller, Qi Youshan, of being in collusion with the bandit. He was immediately detained in the Yimiao Police Station for investigation. After questioning by Director Liu, he was found to be suspected of collusion and was sent to the bureau for legal proceedings.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Verdict Reached in Bai Hongxun's Appeal Case <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Lawyer Bai Hongxun from Zhenjiang, in the autumn of the year before last, colluded with a fugitive from Guangdong named Xu to falsely claim to be contracting the Western food service on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, and contacted Jiang Youtang from Ningbo and Feng Yishen from Tongzhou, agreeing to charge 33,000 yuan after the deal was completed. They first collected an opening fee of 1,800 yuan from Jiang and Feng, and Bai issued a receipt. Later, Jiang and others, seeing that the matter had not been completed for a long time, inquired at the Railway Bureau in the summer of last year, and learned that they had been deceived. The Railway Bureau reported the case to the judicial police for investigation and arrest. Xu had already fled, and only Bai Hongxun was arrested and sent to the Second Special Court. The Judicial Police Office filed a public prosecution on charges of fraud, and the two plaintiffs, Jiang and Feng, also hired lawyer Wu Peng to file an incidental private prosecution to recover the defrauded funds. After trial, Bai Hongxun was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment, fined 400 yuan, and ordered to compensate Jiang Youtang and Feng Yishen 1,800 yuan in foreign currency on June 17 of last year. Bai, dissatisfied with the verdict, filed an appeal with the Second Special Court Collegial Panel. The statement of reasons submitted was tens of thousands of words long, using over thirty sheets of paper. During the appeal period, Bai suffered from orchitis while in custody at the detention center, and his condition was critical. The presiding judge, after verifying the facts, entrusted his defense lawyers, Yu Hualong and Tang Hao, to be responsible for bailing him out for medical treatment. The case was temporarily suspended. Later, lawyers Yu and Tang learned that Bai, after being bailed out, had a plan to escape while receiving treatment in the hospital. They immediately applied to the court to withdraw the bail. The Second Special Court instructed the First Special Court to send police to the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital on Xizang Road on the 22nd of last month to arrest Bai. Permission was granted to find a suitable bail guarantor. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. Now, Bai's illness has healed. The Second Special Court's appellate court has concluded its investigation. Yesterday, Judge Wang Gangxu, along with judges Xiong 苹 and Sun Pengxian, and clerk Tao Zongkan, heard the case in the First Court Collegial Panel. Lawyer Fei Xizhen appeared in court on behalf of the Judicial Police Office. Appellant Bai Hongxun, accompanied by his defense lawyers Yu and Tang, appeared in court to state his reasons for appeal, mainly claiming that the matter was done by the fugitive Xu, and he was only acting as an intermediary. Although he received the money and issued a receipt, the money was given to Xu, etc. Subsequently, plaintiff Feng Yishen testified about the circumstances of the initial contact and payment. The court's inquiry and the lawyers' arguments lasted for three hours before the debate was declared closed, awaiting a scheduled sentencing. Bai was still released on the original bail.</p>

<h3 id="e140">Women's Temperance Union Asks Authorities to Eradicate Beggars in Shanghai; Plans to Form a Joint Beggar Eradication Association to Address Both Symptoms and Root Causes <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Ms. Liu Wang Limin of the China Women's Temperance Union believes that the large number of beggars in Shanghai is a common sight, often begging on sidewalks, along streetcar stops, and at the entrances of alleys, not only obstructing traffic but also affecting the city's image. Therefore, she has drafted methods to address both the symptoms and root causes to eradicate beggars in Shanghai and has submitted a request to the municipal government for approval to instruct its subordinate departments to take action. The National News reporter has learned the details of the plan as follows: Establish a beggar registration office, funded by the Municipal Public Security Bureau in conjunction with the Public Concession and French Concession Public Works Departments. (Location) Borrowing public temples, ancestral halls, public stadiums, and churches would be most suitable. Force all beggars in the city to register at designated locations. Organize a joint beggar eradication association. The responsible groups are divided into three groups: (A) Child Beggar Relief Group, managed by the Child Welfare Association, Futong Shelter, and Longhua Orphanage; (B) Female Beggar Relief Group, managed by the Women's Relief Association, Shanghai Women and Children's Reformatory, and Rendesuo; (C) (Adult Male) Beggar Relief Group, managed by the Homeless Training Institute; Addressing the root cause, i.e., relieving beggars, is even more important. (D) Establish a Disabled Beggar Relief Group, managed by the School for the Blind and Deaf, Xinpuyu Hall, and Leprosy Relief Association; (E) Establish a Orphaned Beggar Committee, managed by Renjitang; Organize an Economic Committee. The administrative expenses will be jointly borne by the cooperating charitable organizations, but the educational and training expenses should be borne by the Beggar Relief Association. The fundraising methods are: (A) Beggars' lives today depend solely on the support of the middle class. Wealthy families always travel by car, and their doors are heavily guarded, so they are spared. Therefore, a property tax would be fair; (B) Mobilizing the Boy Scouts for fundraising and Western and Chinese charity sports competitions would be most effective; (C) Establish a charitable organization and a handicraft product sales outlet; (D) Establish a job placement department. These are the plans to eradicate beggars in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e141">This City's Pawnbroking Industry Urges Reduction in Business License Fees; Social Affairs Bureau Orders Full Collection; Industry Claims Business is Declining, Requests 60% Reduction <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The Pawnbrokers' Association of this city received an instruction from the Social Affairs Bureau stating that the period for the 20% reduction in business license fees for the industry had expired, and that full fees should be collected starting this year. The association, upon receiving the order, argued that the business of its members had been declining in recent years. It submitted a request to the bureau, asking them to forward it to the Municipal Government for approval to reduce the fees to 60% to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. The bureau's order and the association's submission are recorded below:</p>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Order</p>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Instruction No. 66, addressed to the Shanghai Pawnbrokers' Association: "Regarding the case of the 20% reduction in business license fees for pawnbroking shops in this city, as approved by the Municipal Government upon your bureau's submission in May of the 23rd year, with a two-year extension, and communicated by this bureau to all tax collection offices for compliance, the deadline for this reduction expires at the end of this year. Starting January 1st of the 25th year, full fees should be collected according to regulations to comply with the original plan. This order is issued to your bureau for your information, with the hope that you will immediately inform the pawnbroking industry association and all pawnbrokers not in the association." Dated January 15th of the 25th year of the Republic of China. Wu Xingya, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau.</p>
<p>Pawnbrokers' Submission</p>
<p>Regarding the submission of a request: We received your bureau's Instruction No. 66 on January 15th (the order is quoted above). The member businesses of our association have suffered from market decline and sluggish business in recent years, making it difficult to sustain operations. Those declaring closure are increasing one after another, and those勉强勉强managing to stay open are also outwardly strong but inwardly weak, unable to see beyond the present. Regarding the aforementioned business license fees, they not only lack the ability to pay in full, but even the previous 20% reduction was difficult to bear. Therefore, our association, based on a resolution of the members on October 21st of last year, submitted a request to your bureau to forward it to the Shanghai Municipal Government, requesting that starting from the 25th year, the fees be reduced to 60% to show compassion. Now that the period for paying the license fees this year has arrived, the members are anxiously awaiting approval for pre-payment. However, upon receiving the forwarded order, they are inexplicably panicked. Given the dire straits of the industry, imposing additional burdens would be tantamount to a death sentence. Furthermore, the previous 20% reduction was originally intended to address the merchants' difficulties. As the situation has become even more difficult today, relying on precedent, we believe a re-approval is appropriate. Therefore, we continue to submit this request, earnestly hoping that your bureau will consider the merchants' plight, quickly forward the matter to the Shanghai Municipal Government, promptly approve the request, and also advise the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau to instruct all tax collection offices to temporarily suspend collection to provide relief and comfort those who are yearning for it, which would be greatly appreciated. Respectfully submitted to Wu, Director of the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Minutes of the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association Board Meeting: Investigation Decided on the Jiaxing Road Disturbance <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association convened its 26th board meeting on the 14th of this month at its new association hall, No. 288 Maigen Road. All directors attended except for Mr. Cang Gongwen and Mr. Qiu Zitong. Rickshaw puller director He Wushan sent a letter requesting leave, which was immediately approved, and alternate rickshaw puller director Zhu Fengxiang was temporarily appointed. Subsequently, the meeting discussed the conflict that occurred at the Jiaxing Road headquarters last Thursday. The general manager submitted a letter of report. After discussion, it was resolved:</p>
<p>The board of directors should express condolences to all injured staff members, and the board should extend special condolences to General Manager Zhang Dengying, who was attacked by thugs and seriously injured. Furthermore, it should be recorded that the board of directors is very satisfied with General Manager Zhang's service and firmly believes that Zhang's actions are all based on the welfare of all members of the mutual aid association and are perfectly in line with the guidelines set by the board of directors.</p>
<p>The board of directors should make every effort to investigate and bring the thugs to justice and subject them to legal sanction, and prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. In addition, it was learned that Zhang Dengying would soon recover and return to work. The board members were delighted to hear this, saying that Zhang's position was important and irreplaceable. Regarding the second resolution, a small committee was organized to handle the investigation and ensure that the real instigator is brought to justice. Moreover, what can be reported regarding this riot is that after the incident, rickshaw pullers who truly understood the matter were extremely indignant that some rickshaw pullers were being used. Three hundred and eighty-eight rickshaw pullers jointly sent a letter to the Rickshaw Committee expressing condolences for General Manager Zhang's injuries. The gist of the letter was that they feared Zhang would resign due to his injuries and that they would feel deeply regretful. They also stated that because of the hasty timing, only 388 people signed the letter, but the intention of the letter was truly the public opinion of the majority of rickshaw pullers.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the meeting discussed association affairs and the reports of various committees. The association affairs statistical report stated that the total number of medical diagnoses in December was 15,404, of which 2,569 were new cases. There were 691 relief cases, and nurses visited 637 districts. The December report of the Relief and Special Assistance Committee was approved. Among them, a certain charitable organization in Zhabei requested relief, but it was decided that the scope of the mutual aid association's relief was limited to rickshaw puller members, so it could not be approved. The minutes of the Insurance Committee meeting on December 27 were approved. The personnel committee of the labor service center convened a meeting on December 30 and, in principle, approved the Medical Committee's suggestion to use the upper floor of the Maigen Road association hall to establish a small hospital. However, the establishment of a coffin workshop was not approved because the measure was extremely uneconomical and it would be better to establish appropriate terms with outside coffin shops to have them handle it. The board of directors decided to organize a small committee to continue investigating the matter and also investigate matters such as coffin transport and public cemeteries. In addition, it was decided to seek entertainment for rickshaw pullers during the upcoming Spring Festival, and the location should be as widespread as possible. Later, the records of the Medical Committee were discussed. Regarding the establishment of a small hospital on the upper floor of the Maigen Road association hall, in addition to some regulations on the opening and operating costs, the original proposal was approved.</p>

<p>According to the Japanese-language "Japanese Daily News," since the Shanghai Incident, Japanese residents have suffered great losses. The Japanese government, through the Consulate General, lent 5.3 million yuan of reconstruction funds to the Japanese Residents' Association. The loan agreement stated that the funds would be repaid to the government over ten years, starting in the Showa 13th year (Republic of China 27th year). However, the Japanese residents in this city who received these reconstruction funds have been operating since the incident, and their financial situation has become increasingly depressed. Furthermore, due to anti-Japanese sentiment, all Japanese residents have suffered a great blow. Therefore, those who manage to rebuild their businesses with the loans, regardless of the amount of capital borrowed, suffer equally. They have been forced to request the Japanese government to extend the repayment period stipulated in the loan agreement to thirty years. At 2:00 PM on the 15th, Japanese representatives Mr. Lin, Mr. Sakai, Mr. Ota, Mr. Kimura, and Mr. Takematsu discussed the matter at the Japanese Club. They all agreed that the Japanese residents in this city had suffered great losses due to the Shanghai Incident, and since then, the business and industrial sectors have been in a state of recession. Therefore, they requested the government to extend the ten-year repayment period stipulated in the loan agreement, starting in the year after next, to thirty years. However, applying to the government solely on behalf of Shanghai is unlikely to be effective. They plan to take the same steps in Tianjin and Qingdao. A concrete meeting is scheduled for the 19th to request assistance from government officials and businessmen.</p>

<p>A certain Gu A'gen from Pudong opened a tin shop at No. 158 Xinji Beach Road. He had a younger brother named Gendao (22 years old), who was naturally unruly and specialized in wandering around. Recently, his sister-in-law returned to her hometown in Pudong for her grandmother's funeral. Unexpectedly, Gendao developed malicious intentions. At 6:00 PM on the 4th of this month, he bought a bottle of kerosene from a nearby store for thirty copper coins. At midnight, he sneaked into his brother's bedroom, opened the box, and stole two gold rings, a gold lock pendant, seventy yuan in paper money, and three silver dollars, worth a total of one hundred and forty-one yuan. He took them out and hid them in a trash can in the alley. At about 1:00 AM, he poured the kerosene on the firewood and set fire to two places:</p>
<p>In his brother's bedroom;</p>
<p>Beside the stove by the wind furnace in the kitchen.</p>
<p>After setting the fire, he fled to the road, 静ly trying to burn the house down and destroy the evidence. Fortunately, apprentice Yin Hanzhong and carpenter Shi Genfu, who was procrastinating at A'gen's place, noticed and managed to extinguish the fire. Gendao returned at about 2:00 AM and pretended not to know about the fire. Later, Hua Police No. 1344 arrived after being alerted and, after investigating, took Gendao to the police station. Under questioning by the police chief, he denied it and, without evidence, was released. The day before yesterday, Yin A'gen returned to the shop and found that the banknotes and ornaments in the box were missing. He knew what his brother had done. However, after getting the money, he sold the gold rings and other items to silver shops, bought a whole new set of clothes, including a wool coat, leather robe, shoes, a watch, and a leather wallet, and indulged himself in various entertainment venues. At about 7:00 PM that evening, A'gen found him at the Yong'an Rooftop Garden, twisted him over to Hua detective Sun Shaokun, who arrested him and placed him in the Huishan police station. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. 工部局 Lawyer Zhang Shizhu detailed the previous circumstances and asked for an investigation. Yin A'gen, Yin Hanzhong, and Shi Genfu testified about what happened. Detective Sun presented a leather wallet, containing twenty yuan in paper money and a watch, which had been confiscated from the defendant. Questioned, the defendant's testimony was evasive, and he pleaded for leniency. Judge Jiang Shuzi sentenced Yin Gendao to three years and six months of imprisonment, and ordered the leather wallet, banknotes, and watch to be returned to Yin A'gen.</p>

<p>Zhu Jinfu, a Cantonese man over fifty years old, has been working as a clerk at the Jianghai Customs for more than ten years. He is from a modestly prosperous family and currently lives at No. 35 Wenhua Lane, Shigao Tower Road, Hongkou. Zhu's wife, Deng, is middle-aged. The couple has always been very harmonious. Unexpectedly, Zhu's attitude has changed this year. He likes to patronize prostitutes and has become inextricably linked to a Cantonese prostitute named Li Yuejuan. Li is in her early twenties and has a beautiful appearance, so Zhu loves her more than anything. Li also benefits from his wealth and serves him attentively. As a result, Zhu is completely besotted and, fearing that the good times will not last, plans for the long term. He spent a thousand yuan to exclusively hire Yuejuan and rented a room for her at No. 19 Delin Apartment, Chongming Road, as a golden house. The two live together like husband and wife. Zhu's wife, Deng, has heard rumors but has not known the location of his hidden mistress, so she has had to endure it for the time being. Recently, Zhu felt that it was inconvenient to keep Yuejuan in an external residence for a long time, so he made further plans to redeem Yuejuan's freedom and return her to live with his wife. He discussed it with the madam, and an agreement was reached. Yesterday, he discussed it with his wife, but Deng not only refused but also flew into a rage. Zhu feared that Yuejuan would hear about it and ruin the good thing, so he burst into tears of regret. He harbored resentment and, taking advantage of a moment when no one was paying attention, secretly swallowed sleeping pills, hoping to die for love. Later, remembering that he would not see his beloved again, he went to Delin Apartment. When the two met, they told each other the whole story and cried in each other's arms. At that moment, Li Yuejuan suddenly saw that Zhu's face had turned white, his breathing was rapid, and he was about to fall. She was shocked and, after repeated questioning, he revealed the truth. Li Yuejuan was terrified upon hearing this. She quickly reported to the police station, which dispatched a car to send him to Tongren Hospital for treatment, only saying that Zhu was suffering from a stroke, unaware of the hidden story. It is reported that the poisoning was not severe and his life is expected to be saved.</p>

<p>Wu Yousheng, a native of Jiangyin, 39 years old, lived at No. 7 Doupai, Jinsheng Lane, Jinsheng Road. He used to work as a packer in Shandong. Last August, he was dismissed for some reason and came to Shanghai, but he was still unemployed. His wife, Xu, currently works at the Shenxin Yarn Factory. However, her income is very small, making it impossible to support a family of several people. Therefore, the economic situation was extremely strained. Wu, after thinking about it the day before yesterday, was resentful and despondent. That night, while his wife and children were asleep, he hanged himself on an iron pole in the room. At about 4:00 AM yesterday morning, his wife discovered him and hurriedly tried to get him down, but he was already barely breathing. She reported the matter to the Yulin Road Police Station, which dispatched detectives to investigate and summoned an ambulance to the scene. Wu was rushed to Tongren Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective and he soon died. In addition, Zhang Linfu, a local man, just turned twenty, lived at No. 8 Yifeng Lane, Guizhou Road. His father, Zhang Songren, currently works as a bookkeeper at the Tianran Hotel. The day before yesterday, a jacket suddenly went missing at home. Suspecting that his son had stolen it, he scolded Linfu severely. However, that afternoon, Linfu, after being scolded, felt extremely resentful and despondent and committed suicide by secretly swallowing opium smoke. His mother discovered him groaning in bed and rushed him to Renji Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective and he soon died. The hospital reported the matter to the Lao Zha Police Station, which ordered detectives to investigate. The bodies of the two men were sent to the forensic examination office on Filun Road by the respective police stations. Yesterday morning, Zhang Zongru, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, accompanied by forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuyi, arrived at the office and confirmed that the deaths were indeed suicides. They instructed the family members to separately sign statements and take the bodies back for burial.</p>
<h3 id="e149">The Ancient Vase Case Has Just Concluded; Now There's a Diamond Ring Lawsuit; Cheng Linsheng Sues Jiang Zhaoting for Fraud; Jiang Files a False Accusation Against Cheng for Debt <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Jiang Yuting, a Wuxi native and owner of the Yuanzhang Gold and Silver Jewelry Store at No. 99 Shanxi Road, was previously sued by Chi Yunfei for defrauding him of a Guyuexuan ancient vase. The First Special District Court sentenced Jiang to eight months of imprisonment, but the sentence was suspended. Now, Jiang has been sued by real estate tycoon Cheng Linsheng, represented by lawyer Hu Jue, in the First Special District Court for fraud and breach of trust. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Jiang Shuzi opened the Second Criminal Court for interrogation. Cheng Linsheng did not attend. Lawyer Hu stated the reasons for the prosecution, saying, in brief, that the plaintiff had two diamond rings, one worth 10,000 yuan and one worth 4,000 yuan. In the second month of the lunar calendar last year, the defendant said that someone wanted to buy one of the rings and wanted to take it to view it. At that time, the plaintiff handed the ring over to him, but he never returned it. On November 3rd, he suddenly sent a letter through a lawyer, saying that the ring had been used as collateral for Cheng's debt of 18,000 yuan. In this situation, he committed the crimes of fraud and breach of trust under Articles 339 and 342 of the Criminal Code. He requested that the court issue a judgment according to the law. Cheng Linsheng went to Nanjing for business today and could not attend court. Questioned, Jiang Yuting said that Cheng owed me 18,000 yuan for goods and issued three checks, which were all returned due to insufficient funds. Cheng then handed over the two diamond rings for me to sell, and the proceeds were used to repay the debt. However, the two rings were only worth 6,000 yuan and had no buyer. Cheng then said that they would be used as collateral. Because their value was less than 18,000 yuan, he also used the Guyuexuan vase as collateral. He then colluded with Chi Yunfei to sue me for fraud and is now suing me again. Therefore, I am filing a false accusation counterclaim. He hired lawyers Lu Shaozong and Yu Zhonglu to defend him and said that he had already filed a lawsuit to redeem the collateral against Cheng. He then presented the checks and lawsuits to the court. Judge Jiang found the facts clear and ordered the closing arguments, then announced the end of the trial and scheduled the verdict for next Tuesday.</p>

<p>After Xu Weizhen, Director of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court, came to Shanghai at the end of last year to take over the affairs, he held an inauguration ceremony at the Gao Er Branch on Zhejiang Road at ten o'clock yesterday morning. Liang Renjie, Director of the Gao San Branch, was sent by the Judicial Administration Department to supervise the oath. More than a hundred representatives from all walks of life in the party, government, industry, and commerce attended. A record of the grand occasion is as follows:</p>
<p>Representatives from All Walks of Life Attending the Ceremony: The representatives from all walks of life in the party, government, industry, and commerce who attended included Liang Renjie, Director of the Gao San Branch and Supervisor representing the Judicial Administration Department; Luo Panhui, representing Mayor Wu of the Municipal Government; Jiang Huaisu, representing the Municipal Party Headquarters; Deng Peiyi, representing the Municipal Security Office; Chen Qiaozuo, representing the Garrison Headquarters; Jiang Hechun, representing the Finance Bureau; Ye Zhendong, County Magistrate of Shanghai County; He Dekui of the 工部局; Chen Tingrui, representing the Shanghai Lawyers Association; Luo Tong, Director of the Local Court; Zhou Jue, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Zhao Tiezhang, Deputy Director; and more than a hundred people including Xue Dubi, Xu Xiuzhi, Ye Zhuotang, Lin Kanghou, Wang Xiaolai, Xu Peihuang, Zhao Jinqing, and Wang Yunwu.</p>
<p>Xu Takes Oath, Liang Delivers Instructions: At precisely ten o'clock, Xu Weizhen, under the supervision of Liang Renjie, Supervisor representing the Judicial Administration Department, began the inauguration ceremony. After performing the ritual, Xu Weizhen read the oath, saying: "I solemnly swear that I will respectfully abide by the late Premier's will, obey the Party's principles, abide by the laws, be loyal to my duties, not waste a single penny, not misuse a single person, and never engage in embezzlement, bribery, or anything that violates this oath. I am willing to accept the most severe punishment. This is my oath." After the oath, Liang Renjie, Supervisor from the Ministry of Justice, delivered instructions, saying in brief: "The purpose of law in the country is to balance human rights. Shanghai is the hub of national politics, economy, and culture. The manifestation of the spirit of the legal system must not be neglected in such a large city. Director Xu served in the temporary court in Shanghai in the 16th year and was later transferred. During the One-Two-Eight Incident, he served as the Director of the Gao Er Branch. This is his third time. The situation in Shanghai is well understood by Director Xu and he is always able to handle it with ease. I hope that after taking office, he will abide by the orders of the Ministry of Justice and the spirit of the law to serve the country and the people."</p>

<p>Representatives Delivered Speeches: Jiang Huaisu, representing the Municipal Party Headquarters, then delivered a speech, saying: "The social situation in Shanghai is extremely complex. All evil forces and reactionary forces are hidden within it. Only capable individuals can take on this responsibility. Director Xu has served in the judicial circles of Shanghai for many years. Today, he is returning to the old place and should be able to understand the past and innovate for the future. Today, on the occasion of Director Xu's inauguration, I have a few words to offer as a humble contribution: Those engaged in the judicial field must not only be able to 'endure labor,' but also be able to 'bear grievances.' They must not only 'avoid injustice,' but also 'avoid indulgence.' In handling judicial cases, I hope that they will take into account not only national law, but also natural justice and human sentiment." Xue Dubi then delivered a speech, saying: "Director Xu's return to the Gao Er Branch is truly a deep recognition of talent. In this period of frequent foreign invasions and serious national crisis, what we perceive is that only military affairs and diplomacy can save the country from ruin. We do not know that in addition to this, the judiciary also bears the heavy responsibility of national revival. History has the example of King Goujian of Yue, who spent ten years gathering strength and ten years teaching, and was able to avenge Wu. All of these are ancient lessons that the world can be won and saved by winning the hearts of the people through law. Therefore, to resolve the current national difficulties, we must engage in both internal stability and external resistance. External resistance requires concentrating the strength of the whole country to unite against the outside. Internal stability requires unifying the legal system to consolidate the national foundation. However, the Chinese people are still far from the concept of the legal system. For example, in Shanghai, the unrest of all evil forces truly makes those engaged in the judicial field feel disheartened. But we must not be discouraged because of this. We should uphold the law like a mountain and make the people abide by the law. Then the declining morale of the Chinese people can be reversed, and the crisis of national survival can be saved. Director Xu is returning to this court, and we are willing to uphold the spirit of serving the judicial field in the past and shoulder this responsibility." Finally, Wang Yunwu, Lin Kanghou, Wang Xiaolai, He Dekui, and others also delivered speeches. The speeches were too long to be recorded.</p>
<p>Xu Responds and Thanks for Encouragement: Finally, Xu Weizhen delivered a response, saying in brief: "I have been ordered to serve in the judicial circles of Shanghai for the fourth time. The first time I served in the temporary court without holding an inauguration ceremony. The second time I served as the Director of the temporary court and the Director of the Appeals Court. The third decision to serve as the Director of the Gao Er Branch was the same as today's fourth decision, holding an inauguration ceremony. Today, many of the representatives from the party, government, and other agencies who have attended previous times are here again today. I have not dared to forget the words of encouragement from the past several years. Today, I have received instructions and encouraging words from Director Liang of the Judicial Administration Department, Committee Member Jiang of the Municipal Party Headquarters, and all of you. I will not dare to fail to work diligently and follow them, serving the country and the people, in order to live up to your expectations." After the ceremony, a group photo was taken. Xu also told a New Voice News Agency reporter after the ceremony that he would not change a single one of the internal staff of the Gao Er Branch after taking office in order to streamline the process and achieve efficiency in the work. The current record officer is Zhang Dabing.</p>

<p>The Chinese Republic Mining Association yesterday sent letters to various mining companies, stating: "Dear Sirs, we recently heard that Mr. Ding Zaijun of Tai County, while surveying coal mines in Hengyang, Hunan, succumbed to coal poisoning and passed away on the 6th of this month at Xiangya Hospital in Changsha. Mr. Ding was an expert in geology in our country, greatly promoting and expanding the field. His contributions to the mining industry were truly significant. The news of his passing has deeply saddened us. Subsequently, the East China Coal Mining Company sent a letter to our Association requesting that we initiate commemorative measures for Mr. Ding, with an initial commitment of 2,000 yuan, etc. This matter was discussed at the 16th meeting of the board of directors on the 10th of this month, and it was resolved to send a letter to Mrs. Ding, on behalf of all mining company members, expressing our condolences. Simultaneously, we are sending letters to each member mining company, requesting generous contributions, which will be collected by the Association. Based on the total amount collected, a meeting will be convened to discuss the establishment of an initiative to benefit future generations in the field of geology, in order to fulfill Mr. Ding's unfinished aspirations and create a lasting memorial, etc. This has been recorded in the minutes. We deeply admire Mr. Ding’s pure intentions and unwavering dedication. He devoted his entire knowledge and endured great hardship. His decision to survey the Hengyang coal mines led to his illness and death. His hard work and contributions are exemplary and deeply mourned. Your esteemed company undoubtedly shares our sympathy for such a wise and virtuous man. We earnestly request your generous donation of a substantial sum, to be sent to our Association as soon as possible, so that we can convene a grand commemorative event, expressing the sincerity of our colleagues in the mining industry. In addition to this circular letter, we are sending this separate communication to you. We eagerly await your prompt response."</p>
<p>Ding Wenjiang, Director-General of Academia Sinica and geologist, passed away due to poisoning in Xiang in January 4th of this year. People across the country mourned his death. Now, it has been learned that Academia Sinica, in order to commemorate Mr. Ding's talent and learning, has decided to hold a memorial service tomorrow (the 18th) in both Beijing and Shanghai. In Shanghai, the preparatory work is currently being handled by the Academia Sinica's Shanghai Office on Avenue Dubail in the western part of the city. The venue has been arranged, and the memorial service will be held at 2 p.m. tomorrow, presided over by President Cai Yuanpei. Many members of the China Science Society and other organizations will also participate.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Lawsuit Involving Ballad Singers: Dispute Arising from the "Yang Guifei" Ballad Story; Shen Jian'an and Others Sue Wu Jianqing for Insult <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Shen Jian'an and Xue Xiaoqing, ballad singers from the Guangyu Society in Wumen, recently hired lawyer Chen Yun to file a complaint with the First Special Court, accusing Wu Jianqing of public defamation in violation of Article 310 of the Criminal Code, and requesting compensation for damages of one yuan in national currency. The essence of their lawsuit is as follows: The plaintiffs have been performing ballads in Shanghai for many years. Last spring, they compiled a ballad story based on the history of the Tang Tianbao era, titled "Yang Guifei." After completing a portion of it, they intended to broadcast it every night on the Guohua Radio Station starting on October 1st. The defendant, Wu Jianqing, upon hearing this news, personally visited Shen Jian'an and offered to revise the ballad script. The plaintiffs, believing that the defendant had considerable expertise in the opening verses of ballads, agreed. After providing him with a portion of the draft, the two parties could not agree on the amount of remuneration, so the matter was dropped. Unexpectedly, the defendant harbored resentment and published a series of insults in the Xin Xin Chunqiu newspaper. He also placed large advertisements, claiming that the plaintiffs' "Yang Guifei" was a plagiarism of his "Biography of Yu Huan," which they had disguised and were broadcasting privately. He also complained to Huang Zhaolin, the president of the Guangyu Society, and Wei Yuqing, Xue Xiaoqing's teacher, deliberately damaging their reputation. Therefore, they filed this lawsuit. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yang Qianchang of the Ninth Criminal Court summoned the plaintiffs, Shen Jian'an and Xue Xiaoqing, along with lawyer Chen, to court. They also submitted the script as evidence. The defendant, Wu Jianqing, did not appear but sent a lawyer, who stated that Wu was unable to attend due to illness and requested a postponement. He also filed a counterclaim. Judge Yang ordered that the case be rescheduled for a hearing in seven days.</p>

<p>The 30th anniversary of Mr. Wang Xiaolai's arrival in Shanghai and his 50th birthday celebration is jointly launched by Mayor Wu and others. It is scheduled to be held tomorrow at the Lake Society on Guizhou Road. It is learned that Yu Yefeng and Yun Ju-xun are the director and vice-director of the preparation committee. They have been working overnight to supervise the staff, and the work is very intense. Invitations have been sent to all walks of life. However, due to changes in addresses, it is impossible to inquire and return by post, or the labor is not enough, which is inevitable. Those who have friendships with Mr. Wang should be able to understand. Because the anniversary is coming soon, people from all walks of life have been sending cash gifts for days. The preparation committee on the fourth floor of the New New Hotel, Zhonghua Gong, and the Banking Department of China First Trust Company on Beijing Road, and the General Affairs Section of the Huashang Securities Exchange on Sanma Road are all very busy. It is also heard that the Peking opera performance tomorrow night includes the "Xiao He Chasing Han Xin" by Qilin Tong, and "The Imperial Stele Pavilion" performed by Mei Lanfang and Ma Lianliang. It is expected that the front of the Lake Society will be bustling with traffic and people.</p>
<h3 id="e155">City Federation Issues a Letter to Citizens Urging Them to Abstain from Gambling <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>The Citizens' Federation of the First Special District of this city issued a letter to the citizens today, urging them to abstain from gambling, saying: "Because the market is declining and the people's livelihood is becoming increasingly difficult, under this gloomy economic situation, we should eliminate all gold-consuming caves to save expenses and reverse the decline. This is the urgent task of today. Gambling is the most harmful. Desperate gambles lead to despair, and there are countless cases of people seeking short-sightedness by drowning, hanging, and smoking. For example, dog racing tracks, pelota courts, and all gambling dens directly consume money, corrupt young people, waste wealth and energy, and even lead to ruin. Those who love gambling are flocking to them, tempted by profit and infatuated. They squander useful money on meaningless extravagance. This kind of public gambling can only be mutually prohibited. However, what has passed is gone, and what is to come can be pursued. Parents should restrain their children, wives should advise their husbands, and children should persuade their fathers to strictly prohibit entry into gambling places. Company managers, shopkeepers, and store managers should monitor their employees. If they are found to be gambling, they should be given appropriate punishment. Warning slogans should be posted in stores and bedrooms to pay attention. If this is done, the gambling places will naturally be discouraged."</p>

<p>At around 8 o'clock yesterday morning, six men speaking with a local accent suddenly arrived at No. 4, Alley 18 (Ronggui Li), North Sea Road, which is the Shenkang Yang Cloth Store. They claimed to be shopping and broke into the store. The second and third partners of the store came out to greet them. But before they had said a few words, four of the men suddenly pulled out guns, yelled at them to stop, and forced them to retreat into the inner room. Twenty or so other partners were also placed under guard by two other bandits. They were then forced to hand over the keys to the boxes. The bandits went to the accounting room and searched separately. As a result, all the cash, more than 1,400 yuan in paper money and more than 9,000 jiao in change, was robbed, along with clothes and other items, totaling more than 3,500 yuan. But the bandits were still not satisfied and went to the Yutai Zi Shop across the aisle in the same building to rob. Fortunately, the shop did not have a lot of money, so only a dozen yuan was robbed. The bandits then left the building and fled. After the incident, the victimized shop owner checked the losses and reported to the Laozha Police Station, requesting pursuit.</p>

<p>Wang Xueyao, son of Wang Wanao, owner of the Wangji rickshaw company at No. 135 Avenue Heny, French Concession, is known as Wang Xiaokai. He is nearly thirty years old and has a wife and children. Recently, Chen Gaomin (29 years old), a former maid from Yangzhou, hired lawyer Li Ming to file a lawsuit with the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, accusing him of moral offense, inciting abortion, and abandoning his wife. According to the complaint, on the night of June 29th of last year, after the plaintiff took a bath and went to sleep, the defendant Wang Xueyao pried open the door in the middle of the night and entered the room. He raped her and continued to rape her several times, causing her to become pregnant. Wang ordered her to have an abortion, but she refused because she was afraid of endangering her life. He then designed to dismiss her and abandoned her. She returned to her hometown and was driven out by her husband. Unable to make a living, she came to Shanghai to find Wang, but he refused to see her. In desperation, she filed a lawsuit requesting a trial. The court summoned him once on the 31st of last month, but the defendant was unable to appear because he was in his hometown. The date was changed. Yesterday, Judge Li Changnian held a hearing, summoning the defendant Wang Xueyao and his lawyer, Jin Zhi, to court. The plaintiff first testified about the rape and pregnancy. When asked, the defendant said that the accusation of rape was false and requested that the plaintiff be ordered to compensate him for his loss of reputation. The court examined the statements and ordered that the case be adjourned for further investigation.</p>

Yesterday morning, the police station escorted Liu to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. Lawyer Chen Ming of the Police Department presented the case and requested a postponement to arrest the other accomplices and investigate before filing a lawsuit. The detective then reported the arrest process and presented the stolen money to the court. The victim, Zhang Bin, also came to court and described the robbery, saying that the robbers knew how to make water from a tap at home. Pretending that it was damaged, the fake company came and broke in. Liu confessed that he was eighteen years old, was from Yancheng, used to drive a rickshaw, is now unemployed, and has no home.

<h3 id="e161">Wang Jianfan and Others Sued for Property Division <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Lawyer Wang Jianfan is originally from Dinghai, Zhejiang. His father, Zhongkun, had five sons and one daughter. Jianfan is the eldest, followed by Jianxun, Jianyan, Jianji, and Jianwu. Zhongkun owned property in Shanghai in Houshengli, Zhaofeng Road, and jointly opened the Shenda Soy Sauce Garden with others on Tangshan Road. In his hometown, he owned 180 mu of land, so his family was quite wealthy. Jianfan's younger brothers are still receiving higher education. Zhongkun passed away in the fourth year of the Republic of China, and the family affairs were managed by Jianfan's mother. In the 21st year, the mother also passed away. Jianfan, as the eldest brother, took on the responsibility of managing the family. His fourth brother, Jianji, married Hu Yinghua and had two children, Ruchang and Ruli. The elder one is only five years old, and the younger one is only two years old. Jianji died of illness in July of the previous year. Now his wife, Hu Yinghua, is requesting a division of the ancestral property. Zhongqing, her uncle, had originally mediated a settlement, but Jianfan and others reneged. Therefore, Hu hired lawyer E Sen to file a lawsuit with the First Special District Court against Wang Jianfan and his four brothers, requesting a division of the property. The lawsuit claims that the Shenda Soy Sauce Garden has six shares in total, which should be divided into five parts. Jianji's children should receive one share and two-fifths. There are twelve buildings in Houshengli, Zhaofeng Road. The other five brothers have already received two buildings each, leaving two buildings, which should be divided into five parts. There are also 180 mu of land in Dinghai, which should be divided into 30 mu. In addition, there is the income from the rent of the two buildings since August of the 21st year, which should be divided into 303 yuan. The income from the land rent should be divided into 576 yuan. She requests that the court make a judgment according to law. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Tao held a hearing. First, lawyer E stated the purpose of the lawsuit. Then, Wang Jianfan replied that he admitted that the amount of Shenda shares and the ancestral land that the plaintiff should receive was true. As for the twelve buildings on Zhaofeng Road, they had been divided into six parts in the 19th year according to their mother's instructions, with each of the five brothers and their sister receiving two buildings each. He said that the house that the plaintiff was arguing about had long been rented out to his sister, and he produced the account book, saying that the income from the land rent and the soy sauce garden had also been divided equally according to the shares. The court ruled that it was necessary to investigate the evidence further and ordered that the case be adjourned for another trial.</p>

<p>To whom it may concern:</p>
<p>We have received a statement from Yuan Linjiang, claiming that he read a news item in the Shenmin and other newspapers on the 14th of this month, titled "Manure Boat Capsizes at Chenjiazhui," which stated, "As the ferry routinely sounded its horn before leaving, the sailboat suddenly veered to the left, crossing the bow of the ferry. The ferry immediately stopped its engines and reversed." This account is inconsistent with the facts. Mr. Yuan states that on the 13th of this month, at approximately 11:00 AM, his sailboat, Shanghai Registration No. 694, was sailing northeast in the Huangpu River near the Qujiang Wharf when it was struck from behind and the stern destroyed by Municipal Ferry No. 3, causing it to sink. After the accident, the ferry did not stop until passengers on board intervened. Four workers and passengers were rescued, including a passenger named Changsheng, who died from his injuries after being rescued. The worker Yuan Xiangjiang is still missing, presumed drowned. Mr. Yuan has commissioned your esteemed law firm to write to the Shenmin and other newspapers, requesting a correction of the facts. Therefore, we request that you investigate and correct the matter, for the sake of public interest. Respectfully submitted to the Shenbao Newspaper Office, Attorney Li Zonghong, January 16th.</p>
<h3 id="e170">A Visit to the China Electric Light Bulb Factory <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Jiping</p>
<p>In recent years, the domestic electrical appliance industry has shown signs of vigorous growth. Although the nascent electrical industry is under pressure from foreign businesses, several of our electrical experts are still working diligently to manufacture and compete in the market. They are not deterred by the current difficulties. On the other hand, the desire among Chinese people to purchase domestic goods has become widespread and resolute. These two trends are indeed signs of the development of domestic industry. The scope of the electrical appliance industry is vast, including motors, fans, light bulbs, welding equipment, electrical wires, etc. Among these, light bulbs are something that most people living in cities consider indispensable. Therefore, the market for light bulbs is broader than that of other electrical appliances. A little over ten years ago, China did not have any factories manufacturing light bulbs, and those who needed them could only rely on foreign products. Now, we can use "Apollo" or "China" light bulbs, both of which are truly domestic products. It is said that there are now six or seven or more factories manufacturing light bulbs, with brands such as Huatong, Yongming, Fulaisheng, Yongliang, Xinguanghua, Guohua, Guotai, Zhonghua, Zhongguo, Desiling, Yaerden, Mingguang, Haoyou, and Daguangming. Among these, "Apollo" and "China" are the two largest factories, and their products are also more popular. This newspaper published an article about Apollo a month ago. Here, I would like to introduce the general situation of "China" to the readers:</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, at 3:00 PM, the sky was overcast, and the weather was rather gloomy. At the invitation of the owner of China Electric Light Bulb Factory, I went to visit. Our party of four, including Huang Zijian, Ye Changlie, Wu Jinfang, and myself, took a car to the new China factory on Ouyang Road. The General Manager, Tang Zhaoneng, the Manager and Engineer, Li Qingxiang, and the Deputy Engineer, Li Qinghua, had been waiting for us for some time. After chatting over tea for a while, we learned that China Electric Light Bulb Factory has only been around for seven years. Initially, it was capitalized with 50,000 yuan, and the factory was located on Xi'an Road in Hongkou, specializing in the production of both thermos bottles and electric lights. Later, it focused solely on light bulbs. It moved to the new factory last November. The factory building is not large, but the structure is very sophisticated. The scale is not large, but the equipment is very modern. It is truly an economical and rational factory. It currently has over fifty employees and one hundred and eighty workers, producing 5,700 light bulbs per day, with monthly sales of approximately 40,000 yuan. The products include Silver Light Bulbs (Argon), Haole Bulbs (Vacuum), Long Filament Bulbs (Vacuum), Argon Bulbs (i.e., Half Bulbs), White Milk Bulbs (Argon), Sky Blue Bulbs (Argon), Haole Bulbs (Vacuum), Showcase Light Bulbs, Natural Multi-Colored Bulbs, etc., ranging from 3 watts to 2,000 watts, all varieties available. The largest sales are in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, followed by Hunan, Anhui, and Guangdong. Many orders are placed from all over the country. They adhere to the principle of selling existing stock and rarely have any inventory left over. They have over 700 electrical supply stores acting as distributors, so they do not worry about sales channels. Road lights in various provinces and cities, railways, trams, ships, government agencies, and companies all place orders. Therefore, the business is becoming more and more prosperous.</p>
<p>After our initial conversation, we were led by the Chief Engineer and toured the factory, following the order of manufacturing: the glass bulb department, the mixing department, the wire-drawing department, the filament winding department, the filament inspection department, the filament mounting department, the core assembly department, the sealing department, the vacuum pumping department, the gas filling department, the light inspection department, the life testing department, the copper cap mounting department, the light testing department, the packaging department, and the storage department. It took us two hours to carefully examine everything. A small light bulb, from glass sand to finished product, involves forty-seven different procedures. This shows that the creation of every object, whether by machine or by hand, is not an easy task. We felt that two points were particularly praiseworthy during our visit: First, Chief Engineer Li spent two years developing the Silver Light Bulb, which uses silver converted into liquid to coat the inner layer of the bulb, producing a unique light. Its function is equivalent to a light bulb with a reflector, but with the added benefits of energy saving, brightness, and aesthetics. This is his new invention, and the Ministry of Industry has granted him a five-year patent. It is still rarely used in the market, and most people probably do not know about it. Second, after China Light Bulbs became popular, foreign brands such as General Electric, Osram, and Philips suffered a major setback. Therefore, they formed an alliance to compete with China, creating a very intense situation. Fortunately, China's products are as good as, if not better than, foreign products, so the Chinese people are happy to use them. Foreign manufacturers cannot produce light bulbs larger than 500 watts in Shanghai and must import them from their home countries. China can produce light bulbs up to 2,000 watts on its own. Furthermore, China's selling price is generally 20% cheaper than foreign brands. Therefore, China is able to defeat foreign products, giving the Chinese a sense of pride. Due to space limitations, other details cannot be fully described.</p>

<p>The seventh Sino-Youth Basketball League held its second day of competition yesterday, with a total of five matches. The first two matches were Sino-French vs. Yucai and Sino-Youth vs. Huasheng. Due to the disparity in strength, these matches were one-sided. The third match, Hexing B vs. Guanghua, was more closely contested, with the two teams being evenly matched. The final two matches, Zhongji vs. Qiyi and Guohua vs. Shanghai B, were more exciting. The results of each division are summarized below:</p>
<p>Sino-French Defeats Yucai In recent times, Sino-French's basketball skills have been unusually excellent. They have gradually emerged in the various church school basketball leagues in the past winter. Last night's match against Yucai posed a significant threat to Yucai due to the disparity in strength. Sino-French led 22-11 in the first half. In the second half, Sino-French relaxed slightly and lost 7-9. The final score was 29-20, with Sino-French winning.</p>
<p>Sino-Youth Overcomes Huasheng The second match was Sino-Youth vs. Huasheng, with a clear difference in strength. The Sino-Youth team consists mostly of veteran players, while Huasheng is a young team. Naturally, they were no match. In yesterday's match, Sino-Youth's star player, Chen Xianglong, made bold and decisive moves, unstoppable in his attacks, scoring ten points by himself. The portly Dai Changling ran all over the court, earning himself a full sweat. Xu Daogeng also made seven shots, which was commendable. Sino-Youth led 20-14 in the first half and 46-11 in the second half. The final score was 66-25, with Sino-Youth easily defeating Huasheng.</p>
<p>Hexing Defeats Guanghua The third match was Hexing B vs. Guanghua Optical Company. Both teams are emerging teams, with their skills not yet fully refined and their coordination relatively loose. The strength of both sides was average, and there was no exciting performance in the entire match. The score was very close. Hexing's offense was slightly more intense, while Guanghua was disadvantaged by its smaller players. Hexing B led 10-7 in the first half. Both teams scored 12 points in the second half. The final score was 22-19, with Guanghua being defeated. In terms of individual skills, Zhou Pu and Wu Sanjiang of Hexing were relatively active, and their throws were more accurate. He Yutian of Guanghua was able to attack and defend, and is also a promising talent.</p>

<p>— Hu</p>
<p>IV. Team Division Methods</p>
<p>There are four common team division methods:</p>
<p>The first is to divide teams based on the children's abilities.</p>
<p>The second is to divide teams based on the children's interests.</p>
<p>The third is to divide teams based on the children's physical condition.</p>
<p>The fourth is to divide teams based on the nature of the teaching materials.</p>
<p>These four methods can be used interchangeably. Therefore, it may be useful to make slight changes to the team organization to adapt to the needs. Changes in team organization can also help with discipline and enable children to cooperate willingly under the leadership of anyone. Moreover, if the team organization lacks changes for a long time, it can lead to excessive competition between teams. However, to foster loyalty and responsibility among children towards a team, the team organization must also have a certain degree of permanence to produce good results. As for the team's markings, various team colors can be used to indicate them. The team names can also be jointly selected by the children. After the children have selected the team names and team colors, they can adopt a mark to show the distinction. Usually, boys can wear a color-faced and white-bottomed headscarf on their heads. Before the team is divided, the boys in each team can show the white bottom, the whole class is uniformly white. When the team activity is implemented, the boys in each team can show the team-colored side, and each team can be distinguished clearly in a moment, and it is very clear. For girls, a ribbon representing the team color can be tied on the hair, on the one hand, it can tie the hair, for decoration, on the other hand, it can be used for team division.</p>
<p>V. Team Training Method</p>
<p>General principles of team training:</p>
<p>(I) Let the children choose their own leaders and decide on their team names and colors.</p>
<p>(II) Train leaders to speak and give simple commands. Initially, teachers can lead the entire class to say simple commands to enable children to distinguish between strong and weak commands. Later, leaders can practice giving commands and let them find appropriate language to explain what they want to do. Do not allow leaders to explain the leadership method in a whisper.</p>
<p>(III) There is also a vice-leader in the team. The vice-leader is not just a nominal title. Sometimes, when the team needs to be divided into two groups, the vice-leader can lead the other group.</p>
<p>(IV) The team leader must remember that he is also a member of the team. When representing various activities, he must also participate in rotation.</p>
<p>Leader Training</p>
<p>The training of leaders is the core of team training. If teachers want to train each team completely, they must train good leaders in advance. During team activities, the leader is the teacher's representative, responsible for leading the entire team to work together. Teachers should train children to have a certain understanding of the concept of leaders as soon as possible. Teachers should not expect too much from leaders. Some children may not be able to serve as leaders due to a lack of ability. Therefore, teachers do not have to hope that every child can become a good leader. The important principle is that the task of the leader should be assigned to all children in rotation as much as possible.</p>
<p>Training a capable leader requires a considerable period of training. Therefore, each leader should be given sufficient time to show his ability. After a child is elected as a leader, he should show his leadership and command ability. He must also have correct performance ability and skills in other activities. It is of course best if the leader can be a first-class representative, otherwise, he must at least be able to understand the purpose of activities and games, distinguish good and bad performances, and pay attention to whether his companions are following the rules. Teachers should also pay attention not to concentrate all their attention on the leader. Teachers should encourage all members of the team to use common sense to take responsibility for themselves and to assist their partners when necessary.</p>

<p>Nader had been invited to be a partner before and considered it an honor, so he diligently went north every day to find eggs, kept the accounts clearly, and also increased his income a little because of his efforts.</p>
<p>"Ah, Tao Mo! Do you really have to do this?" he said, feeling that if this happened, his reputation would have no place in the trading market from now on.</p>
<p>"I have to do this," Tao Mo replied firmly. "Aimi said that when someone encroaches on (meaning takes the money out of) the property of a company, another person sues him, or uses other methods to attack him, and is unwilling to have anything to do with him anymore. Now you have encroached on my property; I will neither sue you nor hit you, but I have to dissolve our partnership, because I cannot trust you, and of course I don't want to fail."</p>
<p>"Since I can't make you believe in me, and you are not willing to accept my money, but I would rather give you all my money, as long as you are willing to say that you believe that I took the money, then I am still grateful to you. Please be sure to let me still find eggs for you; I don't want any wages, I just do it for free. I am familiar with all the places where eggs are laid, and I love to do this," Nader pleaded.</p>
<p>But Tao Mo shook his head, and his round and interesting face looked suspicious and cold when he decided and said simply, "No; it's better if you are not familiar with it. Don't secretly go and look for me again, and have any plans on my eggs."</p>

<p>Changes in the Gold Exchange's Method of Collecting Market Accounts</p>
<p>The Gold Exchange has changed its method of collecting market accounts, which has been scheduled to be implemented from the 20th of this month. The method is: regardless of whether the broker is a buyer or a seller, after the transaction is completed, there is no need to first stamp the other party, and then fill in the small market account clearly. Use the return receipt book to hand it over to the market affairs section to verify that there are no errors, and then register the account. It must be handed over as soon as it is done according to the market, and no later than five minutes after the transaction (the duplicate account bottom is kept by the broker for verification). Once the account is verified and registered, it cannot be requested to be cancelled or changed. When the amount of conditions and the price are different for the buyer or the seller, the market affairs section will notify both brokers to accompany the official to correct the error. If both parties shirk responsibility and delay resolution, the market affairs section may cancel it for both parties. If one party has submitted the market account, but the other party has not submitted the market account, the market affairs section will notify the broker who has already submitted the market account to urge the other party to submit it quickly. If the other party still does not submit the small market account after being notified, the market affairs section may cancel the unilateral transaction on the small market account that has already been submitted. The small market accounts submitted by the broker to the market affairs section at the close of the market should be verified by the broker before leaving the office. The price numbers on the small market accounts should be written in detail one by one. In order to be convenient, at least "ten," "yuan," and "jiao" must be written. The small market account paper and the return receipt book are made by the exchange. Each broker can use the folding method to receive it from the exchange. The paper fee is borne by the broker to avoid arbitrary waste.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after another round of dramatic rise in the Chinese Securities Exchange, it fell sharply, although it was a common practice to advance sharply and retreat quickly, but it can also prove that the strength of the bulls is weak, and it can be seen that what they rely on is still false. Since the General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed Beijing the day before yesterday to request that rumors such as reducing interest rates and postponing the deadline for angry coupons be announced, people's hearts were greatly shaken, resulting in the rise the day before yesterday, but in the end, before receiving Beijing's reply, most people were still suspicious. Market rumors rose and fell unpredictably again, or it was said that the shorts deliberately made a mystery, making the large number of rumors complex and impossible to investigate. Rumors of interest rate cuts and the North China incident, regardless of the outcome, the current arbitrage transaction of tens of millions does not swap, and the bulls are indeed greatly threatened. This month's transactions are done until the 28th, and there are holidays for the lunar New Year in the middle. In fact, there are four days left, and the last day is far away on the fifth day of the lunar New Year, so there is still a fierce competition in these three days. In the past yesterday, it seemed that one side was squeezing the shorts, and the other side was shorting in the far future, and the most in the afternoon was those who cut the bulls. At the beginning of the market, people's hearts were still very firm, and buying numbers such as 43, 46, 54, and 69 was still enthusiastic. Numbers 11, 33, and 78 were sold more, and the upward trend was still very sharp. Number 48 avoided headwinds and waited for an opportunity. The short gold rose sharply by one yuan and two jiao and a half more. The buying households have already seen fatigue at the final settlement, and number 48 took advantage of the momentum to put pressure on it, and the number of buying households suddenly became scarce, and the market price suddenly dropped by eight or nine jiao, which shows how deep people are in rumors. In the afternoon market, the popularity was low, but there were quite a few shorts swapping, and number 5 rushed to cover this month, which slightly gained some pulling power, but still small three or four jiao to six jiao. As a result, the market prices were mostly near-term rises and far-term falls, and the distance between the near and far terms was farther, so arbitrageurs had less hope of swapping. The total number of transactions was 25.41 million yuan. The results of the rise and fall are compared and listed on the left, unit (unit of transaction 100 yuan)</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported yesterday (15th) that in the New York stock market, bulls suddenly came out in force in the last half hour, and as a result, the number of losses was small. As this matter has nothing to do with the news, it is obviously a natural reaction, a part of the settlement, or due to fear of inflation. The inflation faction in Congress will use Senator Ke Cheng's explanation of Finance Minister Mao Gengtao's remarks on Tuesday to pay the soldiers' pensions with inflation. Re-efforts to make people support the discussion, coal, oil, cement, cowhide, food and sugar stocks were quite strong in the early morning, American radio went in and out greatly, the first to fall was auto stocks, followed by steel stocks, silver stocks were weak, and railways and utilities also fell. Dozens of special stocks found new high prices in the early morning, but after the bulls sold off, they immediately lost their gains. The small exchange and bond market results were slightly lower, and the full-day trading volume was 3.63 million shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left.</p>

<p>The cotton yarn market has turned upward, mainly because the situation of overseas cotton production is stable, people's minds are calm, and the business hours for standard cotton yarn futures, which end this Saturday (the 18th), are mostly busy with closures. Therefore, the market trading feels particularly desolate. The bullish side is still centered on the banking sector, and they are not entirely giving up on pulling prices up. However, industry insiders are unanimously selling short, it is said.</p>
<p>Gold Rooster Slightly Rises by About One Yuan</p>
<p>At the opening of the futures market, prices for all months showed a slight increase. This was because the settlement price for the one-month contract on the previous day was very low, and many were eager to sell. There were expectations of a price drop in foreign cotton, but it was predicted that the Osaka Sampin cotton yarn prices were still stable today, and a slight upward trend appeared, stabilizing people's minds. The market moved forward slowly, with prices for all months up by 1.2 jiao compared to the closing price of the previous day. After the afternoon opening, the market situation was slightly tight, the trading floor was dry, and the situation seemed stable. Da Ji profited by going short, but securities firms closed out many long positions, resulting in relatively light trading. Business hours ended in just forty minutes. As a result, prices for all months rose by 6, 7, and 8 jiao compared to the morning closing price. Sales included 550 bales of Dafu, 600 bales of Yichang, 250 bales of Dafeng, 400 bales of Run Kang, 550 bales of Tonghe, 400 bales of Yuanda, 1,700 bales of Jinchang, 300 bales of Hexing, 450 bales of Dachangcheng, and 500 bales of Taichang. Purchases included 850 bales of Shenji, 250 bales of Tongji, 350 bales of Xincheng, 750 bales of Dafeng, 1,400 bales of Daji, 900 bales of Ruid, and 300 bales of Run Kang. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn Sales: Over 500 Bales, Current Yarn Sales Are Still Good. Statistics show that 560 bales were traded throughout the day. Prices were no different from the previous day. The purchase amounts for each group are listed below:</p>
<p>The Cotton Market Rebounds Firmly. Because most people had expected a large drop in foreign cotton prices on the previous day, news came that U.S. cotton futures had risen by 1 to 10 points. Indian cotton showed mixed ups and downs, and Osaka Sampin cotton futures rose, leading to stable sentiment. Floating accounts actively covered their positions, leading to an upward trend, it is said.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Scatters Short Covering: At the opening of the futures market, U.S. cotton spot prices were up or down by 10 points, and futures prices were up by 1 to 10 points. Indian cotton was up or down by 0.25 to 0.75 rupees. Therefore, scattered short positions were actively covered, and market prices slowly rose. As a result, prices for all months rose by 2 to 3.5 jiao for near-term contracts and fell by 1 to 1.5 jiao for distant contracts compared to the previous day's closing price. After the afternoon opening, Ruid covered many short positions, and Changhe significantly increased their long positions, giving the market a strong appearance. However, Meiji sold off heavily, putting downward pressure on the market. As a result, near-term prices rose by 5 fen, and distant prices rose by 2 jiao. Market trading was unusually quiet. Sales included 1,000 dan of Tongji, 1,300 dan of Gengfeng, 1,000 dan of Changfeng, 2,000 dan of Run Kang, 1,900 dan of Jifeng, 1,000 dan of Yuanda, 1,000 dan of Tongfeng, and 3,000 dan of Meiji.

The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>
<p>Cotton: Demand Gradually Decreases, Current Cotton Consumption Still Weak. Due to the approaching end of the lunar year, the yarn market is temporarily stagnant, reducing the demand for raw materials. Sources include 810 bales of Yao cotton and 315 bales of Tong cotton.</p>
<p>Lu Bao Cotton: 59.75, Day Hua Factory Intake: 83 pieces, spot delivery to factory. Tianjin American Cotton: 52.25, Yufeng Factory Intake: 150 pieces, spot delivery to factory.</p>

<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton opened higher as traders bought near-term contracts, Liverpool firms bought distant contracts, and some swaps occurred. Prices for all months rose by 1 to 4 points. The government sold January and bought May. Only two delivery notices were issued today, and there was a lack of new accounts. The market seemed to be waiting for Washington to announce a new cotton management plan. Before the close, many long positions in the April contract were liquidated, and the close was steady. Spot prices fell by 10 points, while futures prices rose by 1 to 10 points. English cotton spot prices rose by 4 points, and futures prices rose by 6 to 7 points. Indian cotton initially weakened due to sales from Japanese traders and European exporters but rebounded due to short covering and speculative buying. However, it weakened again due to long liquidation. Pingguoer prices were up or down by 0.25 rupees, Aomula fell by 0.25 to 0.5 rupees, and Bai Luoxi remained unchanged. Original telegram on the left (dated the 15th).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Mumbai, the opening forecast for Bai Luoxi cotton on the 16th was 207 rupees, an increase of 1.25 rupees compared to the previous day's close.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, over fifty sources arrived from various groups (over ten thousand shi in total). Due to the year-end closing, bundled purchases saw over five thousand bundles shipped out. However, the buying pressure was also strong, so as a result, the price of thick early japonica rice continued to fall by half a jiao, while the price of thin indica rice also fell slightly by five fen to nearly a jiao. The supply and demand of Du Yangjian rice were similar, and the market remained stable. The outflow of Yin Bian Yuan rice was still sluggish, falling another two chi. Rice shops in both the north and south markets are scheduled to stop sales on the 19th.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, sources from various routes along the river were quite abundant, numbering over seventy. The sales of white japonica rice from various sources continued to be brisk in the market. Brokers moved prices slightly, with prices down by about a jiao. Flat indica rice followed suit with a small jiao decline, while thin indica rice sales were normal for retail. Bundled purchases from Tianjin were quite active, with prices remaining stable. Yang Du Jian rice weakened by several fen, while retail sales of Yin Yuan and Bai Yuan rice were normal, with prices down by nearly a jiao. Prices for other goods also showed weakness.</p>

<p>Yesterday's guest xian rice market turned quiet. Because the year-end closing had arrived, buyers stopped and watched, and sellers were not eager to sell. The general expectation is that the market will be active in the upcoming lunar new year bull market. Most dealers will stop sampling and close the market today and tomorrow, and trading will become even more light. Although there is a lot of inventory in the market, sellers' intentions are very firm, and market prices are able to hold steady. Over a thousand bundles were opened in the unified market yesterday, and prices were similar to the previous market. The unified market was handled by the local street, it is said.</p>

<p>The flour market unanimously showed a brisk trend. Quotations for foreign wheat were down by 0.8 to 1.2 jiao in Chicago and by about 0.48 jiao in Canada. After the opening, due to the approaching settlement day, pending transactions were thinking about covering their positions. It was heard that some Tianjin firms had a small number of chips and were gradually covering them. Factories rarely issued long-term contracts, but long positions were very active, so bids for all months continued to rise significantly. By the afternoon opening, the current month was experiencing tight conditions due to factory self-support and additional purchases from outside the flour industry, leading to a step-by-step tightening of the situation and active trading. Prices for all months were up by about two fen compared to the previous day's closing price, it is said.</p>
<p>The wheat market was stable. Trading in the current month was stagnant due to both sides remaining silent, and the market was filled with empty bids. Distant months initially showed stability, but then the market became active due to the strong flour market. Prices rose by 3 to 5 fen compared to the previous day. By the afternoon opening, the January and February contracts did not open, but the March contract rose by another 1 to 2 fen due to covering by various firms. Trading in the June new flour contract was active, and prices were also stable. The future situation showed a trend of following the flour market upward. The current wheat market showed stable prices and slow trading. Only 500 bales of Shandong wheat were opened, priced at 5 yuan, and were handled by Fufeng, it is said.</p>

<p>The standard sesame market has been trending flat this week. The foreign plantations' buying interest has turned sluggish, dragging down the standard market. Yesterday, it was rumored that foreign plantations were bidding 10 yuan and 5.5 jiao for the February contract, which made the standard market even more relaxed. In the afternoon, no one accepted a bid of 9 jiao for the January contract. Distant contracts were down by another jiao compared to the previous day, it is said.</p>

<p>The foreign plantation tea towel market has been unusually quiet recently. Both Chinese and foreign parties are actively delivering and settling previous transactions of black and green teas in preparation for the year-end closing. In addition, market inventories are low, and the remaining green teas are mostly unsuitable for sale. There has been no response to the Zhenmei telegram sent by foreign firms such as Tian Yu Hua Tea last week, and new transactions have almost completely stopped. However, Tianjin and Fuzhou firms purchased over a hundred boxes of Xiumei green tea yesterday, priced at 9 yuan and 8 jiao.</p>

<p>Yesterday's sugar market trended flat. The guild's bid price for 24 coarse granulated white sugar spot was 22 yuan and 4.5 jiao, and the transit price was 7 yuan and 2.5 jiao, but no transactions occurred.

The local factory's Mian Bai Zhen Ji No. 1 was priced at 21 yuan and 4 jiao, and Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 5 were priced with tax refund. Due to the recent lack of sales, the opening prices for graded goods such as Chao Qing Fan Chi and Diao Qing An Hai Chi have not changed, but buyers' interest is very weak, resulting in no transactions.</p>

<p>The price of dried lily buds has gradually tightened recently due to the thinning of inventory and the presence of both buyers and brokers, leading to a price increase. Yesterday, the market price for top-grade buds was 22 yuan, and for middle and upper-grade buds, it was 20 yuan to 19.5 yuan, with a price reduction.

<p>The arrival of tinplate has been quiet for a long time, and circulation in the market is lacking. However, factory demand is strong, so there have been several transactions recently. Statistics show that over three to four hundred boxes have been sold in the past two to three days, estimated at 58 yuan per box. The market is firm, almost on par with black iron sheets. In addition, there is also a type of "wild chicken" goods, which has been selling well recently due to the shortage of genuine goods. Prices are estimated at 45 to 46 yuan per box, and over a hundred boxes have been sold. Most buyers are cigarette factories and canneries.</p>

<p>— Mo Fu</p>
<p>Night is a magician.</p>
<p>He brings many terrifying illusions and evil spirits, baring their teeth and claws, threatening me. I feel terror and unease. The night is so long. It's really difficult to push him away. Daylight seems like a flash of lightning, and twenty-four hours are completely occupied by darkness. I have a fever, I have insomnia, my spirit is weak, and my head feels like a bomb that could explode at any moment, drowsy and sinking in the clouds. My curved waist has become a bent bow. ——There will never be a time to straighten up! I thought like this as I paced from one corner of the room to the other. I carefully lifted my overly light steps, stepping on the soft, cottony floor.</p>
<p>A fit of coughing forced me to squat down, and my whole body felt like it was splitting apart in pain. Suddenly, I grew countless wings and flew high into the sky——no, it was still that giant hand that hadn't let go of me for three years, grabbing my disheveled hair and lifting me up——could it be that I was about to ascend to heaven? Before this thought could even turn over, I was suddenly struck by some great force, and I woke up, but this time I had turned into a rolling stone that the shepherd spoke of, plummeting from the towering mountain peak into a bottomless abyss. In my heart, I was still wondering if I would hit a reef. Although it was clear that rolling down this ten-thousand-ren precipice would certainly mean death, I wanted to live, and I struggled as much as I could.</p>
<p>…I woke up, but I was lying on the floor, a pile of bloody phlegm staining my clothes. Once I understood what I had just gone through, I trembled.</p>
<p>With bleary eyes, I saw that furry hand again, which for three years had played out countless terrifying and tragic farces in front of me, and would continue to do so until my last, I knew.</p>
<p>The light gradually dimmed, and the last ray of light was swallowed by the darkness, and the entire room was enveloped in a solemn night.</p>
<p>Finally, I struggled onto the bed, facing the window, opening my eyes wide, and panting as I gazed at the azure-colored glass.</p>
<p>"No, I can't stand this pressure"! I whispered resolutely, but where did I get the strength to retain time? After a hard struggle, I turned on the electric light. This was the only thing I could do, the ability to fight against the darkness. The piercing electric light made me unable to open my eyes.</p>
<p>This disease of mine is not suitable for using my brain, the doctor had warned countless times. It's not that I deliberately resisted either. I knew I should rest, I needed to rest, and I tried my best to stop it from working, but the result was worse, as if the brain was a stubborn snake.</p>
<p>"Die! Die a little faster!"</p>
<p>I shouted angrily, with the same feeling as a prisoner speaking to an executioner.</p>
<p>Clawing at the bed, I longed for a minute of rest, my eyes fixedly staring at the ceiling, my mind spinning, and the ceiling was spinning with it. All sorts of illusions began to jump before my eyes as before, both funny and terrible. Sinking into a sleepwalking state, I felt myself soaring, the sky, or sinking into a deep abyss, flying and racing across mountains and ridges… arriving at an unknown place——no, this is hell, where the demons attack me without restraint… I woke up covered in cold sweat, my heart pounding violently in my chest, my lips trembling, and my eyes wide with fear, looking around in a panic… I will never be able to return to peace again! I looked at the table clock placed on the table, it was only a few tens of minutes, and sighed deeply, followed by terrible coughing. Again and again, sometimes it's a demon giving me a knife to the chest, and bright red blood shoots out like a fountain all over the place. Suddenly, the change is not caused by external forces, the blood is vomiting on its own. Suddenly, a pointy-mouthed monster appeared in front of me, bent down and drank all the blood on the ground, and then tightly embraced me with its thick, hairy arms, inserting a tubular mouth into my chest… I fainted from this unbearable pain; sometimes I saw many friends surrounding my corpse and sighing, and I felt how foolish they should be, isn't this worse than living in sin? Sometimes I'm lying in a tomb in the wilderness… but it contains the same meaning.</p>
<p>The last time I woke up, I mistook the dim light for the morning light, and a glimmer of hope was extinguished again.</p>
<p>Night is hell.</p>
<h3 id="e211">The Way Out for New Poetry and the "Hu Shi Style" <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Zi Mo</p>
<p>I am very optimistic about new poetry. The recent trends in the poetry world clearly tell us that new poetry has its way out.</p>
<p>In terms of content, it has shifted from personal sentiments to social colors. In terms of form, it has moved from imitating the carving of rhetoric to using creative colloquial language. We cannot but admit this kind of progress in Chinese new poetry. The "Hu Shi style" that evolved from old poetry and lyrics has only left faint traces in the new poetry movement. Even the "Spring Water style" that was obviously influenced by Tagore and Japanese haiku, and the so-called "New Moon style" that was influenced by Western romantic poets and emphasized "beautiful form" a little later, as well as the obscure symbolic and allegorical style imitated from France a few years ago, only occupy dark and distorted corners in today's new poetry world. Like other departments of literature, what we need for new poetry is the singing of the masses, the grasp and exposure of social reality, and the enlightenment of social trends. And the current new poets are also working hard in this direction.</p>
<p>In terms of form, one difference between poetry and novels, dramas, etc. lies in the economy of its language. However, the so-called economy and non-economy are by no means determined by elegance and vulgarity. A new poem that is piled up and carved with many elegant words, beautiful metaphors, allegories, and even allusions, is not necessarily economical if the content is empty. Conversely, if one can use simple and concrete colloquial language to express reality, and make people have very concrete and profound impressions and feelings, then it is economical and successful poetry.</p>
<p>By saying this, I am not advocating that new poetry does not need "beautiful form" or does not need skills. However, just as a woman's beauty does not lie in applying rouge and powder, wearing corsets, and wearing high heels, beautiful form does not come from imitation and carving. The search for the most flexible and concrete means to powerfully express content is where new poetry should strive in terms of skills. To achieve this goal, the dead, elegant words should not be as good as the living spoken language. The works of the new German poet Becher and many new Russian poets provide us with a good example.</p>
<p>The so-called free poetry of the past few years failed, not because of its inelegance, and even less because of its use of spoken language (because it was not really colloquial), but because of its poor content and immature skills. The shortcomings of the current social new poetry are not that it uses colloquial language, but that it does not use colloquial language well. This is partly related to the author's general technical training and familiarity with the spoken language, and the more important reason is the lack of rich experience of the author in the mass life. Yes, poets like the new Russian poets who came from the lower classes of society have not yet been discovered in China, so the hope for the popularization of new poetry cannot be overly extravagant. However, this direction should and can be striven for. In fact, the achievements in the past few years have not been bad.</p>
<p>It is of course very good if new poems can be sung, but being able to be sung is not an indispensable condition for new poetry. The folk song style or the "Feng Yuxiang style" is relatively stronger than the "Spring Water style" or the "New Moon style", partly because it can be sung, and also because they are popularized——describing the masses and being understood by the masses. If we were to learn from old poetry and lyrics in order to achieve the condition of being able to be sung, even if we succeeded, it would not be a success for new poetry. It must be known that content can determine form, but at the same time, form will also affect content. "Old wine in new bottles" is not feasible either theoretically or from the history of poetry development. Using forms derived from old poetry and lyrics to express new content will always reduce its realism or even "harm the meaning with words."</p>
<p>Having acknowledged the points mentioned above, it is very clear whether the so-called "Hu Shi style" is a way out for new poetry, and whether it should be adopted and promoted.</p>
<p>Taking "In Praise of Little Flying" as a representative work of the so-called "Hu Shi style," even if no tune is filled in, the pattern and odor of "Little Order" are still retained between the lines. The reason why the last few lines are too "literary" is really not surprising, because turning somersaults in this kind of old poetry and lyric skeleton will not only not turn out very far, but also naturally follow its way. Not to mention the expression of the leisure class's "leisurely" mood in the content of this poem. It is true that there are many very popular songs and tunes (especially Yuan songs) that are worth learning from. But the so-called learning is not just imitating or drawing from the styles of Yuan songs or Ming and Qing zaju dramas, but to learn their spirit of boldly, flexibly, and accurately using colloquial language to express themselves. One era has its own literary content, and it also has its own literary form. Just as the relatively elegant Kunqu Opera gave way to Peking Opera, the era of the hobbling "Hu Shi style" has long passed. In the eyes of those who are familiar with old poetry and lyrics—that is, what Mr. Bohan called "that part of people who are well-versed in old poetry and lyrics"—new poetry is naturally not only difficult to understand and pronounce, but also not flavorful enough. But this is not the error of the current new poetry's route, but only the error in the pace when walking this route (the shortcomings of new poetry in content and technique mentioned above), and it is also a temporal error in the views of this part of people. It is very obvious that new poetry does not need to go backward for the sake of this part of people. What we hope from new poets is to do their best to enrich the social content of new poetry, and to creatively use colloquial language to express this content, creating new forms. Needless to say, immersing themselves in the life of the masses, increasing their own experience, and learning vivid skills are even more prerequisites for new poets.</p>
<p>At this time, specially putting forward the "Hu Shi style" and considering it as a way out for new poetry will only result in "this road does not lead anywhere."</p>

<h3 id="e213">On the Question of New Poetry's Form <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Ren Jun</p>
<p>Last November, I published an article "On the Road of New Poetry" in the third issue of this publication, raising objections to Mr. Chen Zizhan's advice to new poets to follow the "Hu Shi style." Following the publication of that article, I saw Mr. Chen Zizhan's "A Brief Discussion on the Hu Shi Style" and Mr. Bo Han's "Recent Poetry Criticism and Poetic Talks," which partially touched on my debate with Mr. Chen, in the sixth and ninth issues of this publication.</p>
<p>In the article "A Brief Discussion on the Hu Shi Style," Mr. Chen vigorously defended his position and made every effort to annotate his previous article. However, there is one difference: in the previous article, Mr. Chen only vaguely advised new poets to follow the "Hu Shi style," while in this one, he clearly stated: "But I do not hope that you will still take the old road of 'A Book of Experiments,'" because Mr. Chen also believes that "the old road has not shaken off the traces of imitating old poetry, it is really like enlarged feet that have been bound too tightly"; on the contrary, he hopes that people will create poems in the style of "Ode to a Flying Insect," because "such poems can be said to be a new road." That is to say, the "Hu Shi style" that Mr. Chen advises people to follow is the "new road" of "Ode to a Flying Insect," not the old road of "A Book of Experiments."</p>
<p>However, the problem lies here.</p>
<p>Now we must ask: can poems like "Ode to a Flying Insect" really be said to be a new road in terms of the "Hu Shi style"? This is really the main key to the problem, and there should be a definite answer. It is definitely not enough to vaguely say "it seems" to be possible or "it seems" impossible. - And if you want to give a definite answer to this question, I think the most practical and reliable way is to compare it with the works in "A Book of Experiments," which even Mr. Chen considers to be an old road, to see what kind of differences there are between it and them, and how much newer it really is than them.</p>
<p>As far as I know, the works collected in "A Book of Experiments" (I am based on the old version), except for a small part that is written in relatively simple classical Chinese (or called "vernacular"), which cannot be regarded as representative works of Hu Shi's attempt to create new poems, old poems and old lyrics (such as "Mid-Autumn Festival," "On the River," "Qinyuan Spring," "Like a Dream"), most of the remaining works can be said to be of the same type as "Ode to a Flying Insect." Now, let's take the poem "On the Lake" as an example:</p>
<p>A firefly on the water,</p>
<p>A firefly in the water,</p>
<p>Side by side,</p>
<p>Gently,</p>
<p>Flying past the edge of our boat.</p>
<p>The two immortals fly closer and closer,</p>
<p>Gradually merging into one.</p>
<p>Look, what is the difference between "Ode to a Flying Insect" and this type of "Hu Shi style"? What is more refreshing about it? Really, if you have the time and interest, you might as well read "Ode to a Flying Insect" and most of the works in "A Book of Experiments" side by side, and you will definitely feel that the "Ode to a Flying Insect" that is considered a "new road" not only does not exceed them by a single point, but also, even though they are all old works by Hu Shi from more than ten years ago, you can also find many expressive methods that are more free, lively, and farther away from old poetry; although, as the author said, they still "have the bloody smell of the era of foot-binding."</p>
<p>Therefore, I think that if Mr. Chen always considers the "Hu Shi style" to be a "new road" and wants to advise people to take it, that is Mr. Chen's personal freedom, and others have no right to interfere; but if he forcibly tries to find some new goods from the old goods stalls selling outdated goods as the basis for his own position, that is unnecessary. In short, let's take a look at Mr. Bo Han's opinion on this issue. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Wang Renshu</p>
<p>——Reading Balzac's Critical Notes——</p>
<p>In Marie's book of criticism on Balzac, there is such a passage at the beginning:</p>
<p>In the ingenious preface to "Facino Cane," Balzac reveals the secret of his creation. - He transcended himself and assimilated himself to the diverse life of the world. Look at the following section, which is a confession.</p>
<p>'At that time, I lived in a small street. Readers may not know it, it is called Rue de la Clef. Facing the spring next to the Place de la Bastille, starting from Rue Sainte-Anne and ending at Rue des Fossés-Saint-Victor. The desire for knowledge threw me into a room on the roof of a certain building. I worked hard here at night. During the day, I spent time in the nearby Mazarine Library. I lived a simple life. Content with all the conditions of a monastic life indispensable to workers. No matter how good the weather, there were hardly any days to take a walk on the Boulevard de Breton. Only once, attracted by some kind of passion, I was drawn away from the habit of research and went out. But, even so, isn't it research? I had to observe the customs of the remote streets, the people who lived there, and their characters. They were as dirty as the workers and just as unceremonious. They were not at all wary of their surroundings. I mingled among them, watching them haggling over sales and arguing with each other when they left work. My observation was already intuitive. It went deep into the souls of people. But it did not neglect the external expressions of the body. It can be said that it first tightly grasped the frank part expressed externally, and then immediately broke into its inside. Such observation gave me the ability to live in the lives of those being observed. Just like the Islamic monks who appeared in Arabian Nights, without chanting any spells, they could take away people's flesh and souls, and I merged with those being observed.</p>
<p>'For example, one night, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I ran into an employee and his wife coming out of the Théâtre des Funambules. I remember following them closely from Pont-aux-Choux Street to Boulevard du Temple. At first, the honest couple talked about the plays they had seen. But the topic shifted from one to another, and gradually they talked about their own affairs. The wife never heard the child whining, even though she was pulling the child along. The couple were calculating tomorrow's income, and wanted to use the money in twenty different ways. First, they carefully talked about arranging their livelihood: how the value of potatoes was very high, the winter was getting longer, firewood was becoming more expensive, and about the opinion of borrowing money from the bakery, they all told each other. Their discussions were very enthusiastic, and the different personalities of the two people were indeed very well displayed in their words. Hearing the words of such people, I became a part of their lives. I seemed to feel their tattered clothes on my back. My feet were walking in their shoes with holes. Their desires and hopes all rushed into my soul. Perhaps my soul was already connected to their souls. This is a dream of those who have their eyes open. The boss of the factory abused them, the hooligans, and didn't give them money, running around for nothing. These words made me angry along with them. Abandoning one's own habits, immersing oneself in the intoxication of spiritual action, indulging in such a game, this is my comfort. Who allowed me to have such talent, such insight? This is probably a quality that will eventually be abused. I will never explore the reasons for the origin of such an ability. I only say that I have this ability and can use this ability. From that time on, I began to analyze the various elements of the uneven group under the term "the people." I had to evaluate their good or bad qualities to engage in analyzing the masses. What I want to let readers know is only this. What is the use of remote streets to me? From that time on, I suddenly understood. Remote streets are the training ground for various changes. Here, heroes, inventors, scholars of strength, rascals, extremely evil villains, virtuous people, hooligans, etc., are all oppressed by poverty, panting under persecution, drowning in wine, and exhausting their bodies and minds with strong drinks to bury their lives..."'</p>
<p>Not stopping at the appearance and surface of things, but being able to penetrate into the root of life that determines other things, and becoming a great revealer of the surrounding life, this is the essence of a genius observer. He has the courage to see society in reality, and he can describe this society in fierce attacks. He can break in with the incorruptible beauty of his eyes, and call out the true tasks of the laws and religions that many powers are working hard to advance. From this, he gives an immeasurable gift to those who can recognize the world in which they live. He preaches to those people, and he believes that nothing in the world is not interconnected. Everything contains meaning in itself, but knowing how to distinguish this meaning becomes a problem. He often draws deep and novel lessons for people from various facts. Therefore, among the great teachers of mankind who are advancing towards conscious thought, his position is very high. ..."</p>
<p>This passage, I think, is very useful for people engaged in creation. I have said elsewhere that writers are easily swayed to distort the truth of reality with their subjective opinions. It makes the people who appear in the work seem to be dragged into the story. But as Balzac said, observation as a practice of life is naturally different. Because he is not standing aside and making calm observations, but living in the lives of those being observed. The reason for this, as Marie said elsewhere: "He has a sharp sense of the nature of the times and the conditions that determine it. He discovers the hub of the wheel there." But what cultivates his sharp senses? "He knows the terrifying struggle of society, and in the battle with the world of money, he resolutely formed himself with extremely heavy suffering. This is the reason why his works miraculously become so alive, and this is also the reason why he has the possibility of breaking into the core of the world. Under the constant whip of poverty, he grasps his era fully and intensely."</p>
<p>So what poverty gave Balzac was: it made him tough and brave, and in order to escape the heavy burden that the world hated on him, he ignited the fire of his creation when necessary. But this is also a liberation that transforms his daily suffering into magnificent radiation. He said: "Only when I work can I forget my pain. Work saved me, which is the best explanation. Likewise, due to poverty, he knew the importance of economic conditions in the totality of social life. In his works, we can see that those who cannot adapt to life and the new necessities of the transitional period in the economic structure of society are gradually falling behind. "The whole era, with its pressing reality, passes before his great mirror, allowing people to recognize the rise of the power of the bourgeoisie in that era, which arose along with the powerful development of industry and commerce, the movement of the aristocracy towards the victorious bourgeoisie, the overthrow of the old forms of life, and the establishment of new classes that brought out their own forms of life in all fields...etc."</p>
<p>Here, we can also say: remote streets are the training ground for various changes. And the life of poverty is the whip that encourages genius to exert its greatest talent. He not only understands the truth of this society in suffering, but also makes magnificent internal radiation in suffering. Uniting the necessity required by the heart with the necessity from an objective point of view, this becomes the reason for Balzac's greatness.</p>

<p>— Long Gonggong</p>
<p>When I was very young, I received different warnings from my father and mother. My father heard me whistling, stared at me sternly, and said that it was a lowly behavior. My mother did not forbid me during the day, but when she heard me pursing my lips and making that sharp sound at night, she said to me in a terrified, pleading way:</p>
<p>"Don't make this strange noise, don't, it will attract ghosts."</p>
<p>But in some later experiences, I really liked that natural flute that some people thought would attract demons. Its sound is not a strange noise, it is the breath of human emotion, clear, beautiful, and different from any musical instrument - no musical instrument can be compared. The sound of human voice cannot be imitated.</p>
<p>Those things happened in different places. One time it was in the morning, and I was walking on a country path with a young farmer who was short and very alert. I heard him whistling, like a lonely mountain song, or a happy pastoral song. I saw a pure, lively, and kind person. I was proud to have such a human being walking with me. On a sea ship, I heard someone whistling a low tune; there was no sea, no clouds in front of me, (although they were so great and lovely) I lost my own place, and almost thought - or even saw - my two friends without any illusion: young, brave, and loving the truth, one was far away in some place, and the other had died without any regrets. If I had not discovered this same song, I would have thought that no one else understood this song. Another time, on a small, winding mountain, in order to find someone who was already good and didn't know where he was hiding, I whistled the short song that we both liked, and suddenly, I found the familiar sound.</p>
<p>I can now judge a person's ideals, character, and habits from the whistle he blows. At first, I thought it was my own absurdity, or at most just a coincidence.</p>
<p>Some people whistle badly, very brokenly, or blow vulgar tunes, or make sounds without scales, or simply don't know what they are whistling.</p>
<p>I know some blacksmiths, when their emotions suddenly relax, they will whistle a long whistle. Sometimes on the road, you can hear some free tunes created by coolies mixed with humming. Next to the university, it's not surprising, anyone will hear some smug popular movie songs.</p>
<p>My observation of people proves my own clumsiness. I can never infer whether a person is good or bad from his words, face, bones, or way of dealing with people. Even if I know he has done something stupid, I still can't decide his category. - So I have to rely on other methods.</p>
<p>If he can whistle, I hope he will whistle for me to hear. I whistle first, thinking:</p>
<p>"The mouth is not only for eating and speaking. You won't lose its value if you use it to do other better things."</p>
<p>My greatest disappointment is if he remains silent at this time.</p>

<h3 id="e217">The Activity of Military Alliances <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the Second World War will break out this year, it is obvious that 1936 is a very serious period. The Italian and Ethiopian armies are still deadlocked, which is one of the crises. The London Naval Conference is on the verge of collapse, which has a considerable impact on the future of the situation. Also, in East Asia, on the one hand, imperialism is intensifying its attack on our country, and on the other hand, there is the opposition between Japan and Russia, which is enough to threaten world peace. What is particularly disturbing is that various news about military alliances has been spreading from various places recently. The smell of gunpowder has permeated the world, and this year is the most dangerous day when a great disaster is imminent!</p>
<p>There are a total of four rumors about military alliances: one is the Japanese-German alliance, the second is the Soviet-Russian alliance with Outer Mongolia, the third is the Sino-Japanese alliance, and the fourth is the British-Japanese alliance. Some of these news are naturally very unreliable and can only be regarded as a propaganda effect on a certain aspect, but some are quite convincing. For example, the Japanese-German alliance has been widely rumored by all parties, and it has been rumored repeatedly for a year. Now there are even rumors that they secretly signed a military alliance agreement four months ago. Although this matter cannot be verified and has been denied by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it is said that the Japanese-German alliance was negotiated by the Japanese military attache stationed in Berlin and the German defense representatives. It is said that the Japanese military department changed its approach and took direct action in order to avoid the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from coming forward.</p>
<p>The Japanese-German military alliance is not only widely rumored by all parties, but also very possible from the perspective of facts. The two countries have shown several similar characteristics. Japan is a militaristic country, and Germany is also a militaristic country. They are both traitors to the League of Nations, both tearers of treaties, both have the ambition to seize colonies, and both have enemies with conflicting interests (Japan's enemy is the United States, and Germany's enemy is France). Also, the two countries have the same stance in opposing Soviet Russia. According to some rumors, this time the Japanese-German alliance has two goals: one is a military secret agreement, and the other is a public agreement against communism. In this way, their collusion is nothing more than carrying out their atrocities of destroying world peace and encroaching on the weak under the cover of the anti-Russian banner!</p>
<p>The alliance between Soviet Russia and Outer Mongolia is also possible from the perspective of the two countries' opposition to Japan. The conflict between Japan and Russia has become increasingly acute. The situation during the recent disputes between the two countries is very dangerous. Some people speculate that a Japanese-Russian war is inevitable. As for Japan and Outer Mongolia, the threat of the Japanese puppet army to Outer Mongolia has become more urgent recently. The Outer Mongolian authorities have reportedly made up their minds to prepare to resist. It can be seen that their opposition to Japan is consistent. The visit of the Outer Mongolian Prime Minister and his party to Soviet Russia certainly has some political implications. However, this news about the military alliance between Soviet Russia and Outer Mongolia is only seen in Japanese propaganda, and it is not known whether it has other effects. However, judging from the policy recently adopted by Soviet Russia in diplomacy (i.e., peaceful diplomacy), it is unlikely that a military alliance will be concluded.</p>
<p>As for the Sino-Japanese alliance, it was advocated by Japan's Hirota. China and Japan jointly requested the Soviet Russian government to open up Outer Mongolia. If rejected, China and Japan would form a military alliance to deal with it. Regarding this matter, it was originally a big question whether China and Japan had the possibility of concluding an alliance.</p>
<p>The British-Japanese military alliance is a restoration of the old alliance, and the possibility is also very high. Before the European War, Britain and Japan concluded an alliance. Recently, people from both sides have repeatedly brought it up again. This was advocated by a part of the British naval community, believing that since the United States is mired in an isolationist policy and has failed to intervene in Far Eastern affairs, China and Japan can form a general understanding. If the British-Japanese alliance can be restored, Britain's interests in China can be maintained. Not long ago, it was widely rumored that Britain and the United States would jointly confront Japan, but now there is news of a British-Japanese alliance. International relations are so complicated. However, a look at Britain's recent accommodation to Japan in the naval conference shows that the rumors are not entirely unfounded. In order to maintain its position in the Far East, Britain hopes to restore its alliance with Japan.</p>
<p>The activity of military alliances is a harbinger of the coming of war!</p>
<h3 id="e218">Winter News <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Zhihua</p>
<p>The streets are desolate and quiet. The once bustling pedestrians have all shrunk into woolen garments.</p>
<p>Walking on this deserted street, I feel like I'm stepping into a dilapidated courtyard, and my heart feels a little desolate. Looking at the upright French parasol trees, I think of the distant northern lands, the people of the northern lands, and the rustling white poplars of the northern lands.</p>
<p>The south is filled with warmth, drifting with the fragrant scent of warm flowers and the cries of crows. Today, however, it has turned into a piercing cold.</p>
<p>In the past, I was a dreamer. The South in my dreams was draped in the azure blue of spring all year round: whether in the countryside or in the city, it was bathed in the warm breeze of March. Of course, this dream is shattered. Like any corner of the world (except for that one-sixth of the land), it is plagued by hunger and cold. It is like a syphilitic patron, entertaining and struggling frantically. It knows its future very clearly. When I set foot on the land of the South, stepping onto the asphalt roads of Shanghai, what follows is this familiar demon: hunger and cold.</p>
<p>In summer or spring, I worry about the arrival of winter. I am afraid to see it, its stern face.</p>
<p>But it has come after all, sweeping away the leaves, sweeping away the green of the fields, and even sweeping away the warmth of people's bodies: the whole world is trapped in an ice cellar.</p>
<p>Stepping on the bright and solid asphalt road, a chill rises from the soles of my feet. My heart feels it quickly, my lips chatter, my fingers ache and feel cold, as if they have been taken out from a tight squeeze. The sharp northwest wind, carrying an unresolvable anger, freezes my nose red and drills into my thin, loose sleeves! Everything is winter: the winter streets, the winter wind, me, a winter pedestrian.</p>
<p>Winter is cold, cruel, and forever cursed. Of course, I cannot praise winter as I would praise spring. However, when a person is driven mad by passion, they need a bit of the winter wind to wake them up. Just as a person is born in the spring of youth, the spring breeze gives them the power to grow, gives them the love to grow, and they grow. When the summer-like middle age arrives, they scatter the seeds of life like a storm, attacking their enemies like madmen. They have no thoughts, no worries. However, when the autumn-like old age arrives, everything withers and declines with the blowing of the autumn wind. Although the flame of youth has not completely extinguished, people in their forties are full of fiery complaints. Now, in this kind of winter, people are old. They caress the palms of their hands, polished by the grind of life, and with a mind that is calmer than ice, they count the wrinkles on their foreheads, blowing the experiences, those fallen-leaf-like experiences, into the mud with the wind, to be used as a reference for their children who come after them.</p>
<p>Winter is cold, clearing away the heart enveloped by passionate love threads.</p>
<p>In the embrace of winter, we review the memories of the year. That way, we can decide how to start our steps next year. We will use all our strength to unleash the power that the spring season gives us, towards the road of life.</p>
<p>I am still stepping on that cold asphalt road. It presents a shining black iron face, just like the face of life.</p>
<p>However, even if the sound of my chattering teeth is louder, even if the wind blows harder, I have no time to care. I walk forward.</p>
<p>Turning the corner, it is a busier road. The streetcar, with its urgent shouts, flies by as if escaping the pursuit of winter. People's heads are shrunk into their overcoat collars, and their hands are hidden in animal fur. They are escaping winter, just like an old man fearing the approach of death.</p>
<p>Passing this street, it returns to the desolate road. I listen to the rhythm of my footsteps, the sound of the streetcar that has already gone far away, and my eyes look at the swirling tung leaves. My heart is filled with desolation, especially when I think of the people of the North and the rustling white poplars of the North.</p>
<p>Walking on the road, in the winter wind.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Window <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>For it, the window, I have many memories and feelings.</p>
<p>Once a person hides in a house, although they may not suddenly feel detached from the world, they are at least temporarily separated from the chaotic things outside. And it, the window, seems to be a bridge, connecting your heart to everything outside the window. Looking down from the window, there may be a chaotic street scene, the noisy sounds of people and vehicles pouring into your ears, immediately making you restless again. Therefore, the direction of the window is best if it does not face the street. Looking down, there is only a lonely and quiet alley, and it is not easy to hear the sound of people's footsteps for a long time. And looking up: it is the tip of a house covered in the lush green shade of tall hazel trees, red, blue, brilliantly shining in the bright sunlight. The sky is clear, light blue, without a single cloud, like an uncolored painting. And occasionally, a little bit of soaring wings appear from the distant sky, as if written into the distance.</p>
<p>A very relaxed and pleasant mood surges into my heart.</p>
<p>That pleasantness, that ease, comes from the window. If the direction of the window is changed to face the street, you will hate and curse it for no reason, and then angrily close the window.</p>
<p>Find a house with a window that has beautiful scenery outside. In the long days, in different seasons, the proper window location of a house is indeed very important and necessary. Because of it, the relationship of the window often transforms a person's state of mind. In the hot summer, a south-facing window still has a cool breeze blowing in from time to time in the hot air, allowing you to take a breath. If it is a west-facing window, the poisonous sun of June fills the room, and people simply become wontons in a steamer. Once, for a year in the summer, I was annoyed for some time because of a west-facing window. Moving to another house in an instant was impossible, so the house was like a burning pit, and I spent a summer that felt like half a century. By the time autumn came, I had been ground down until I didn't look much like a person anymore. Even now, thinking about it, I still hate it a little, that west-facing window.</p>
<p>When the harsh winter comes, the window must not face north. However, in winter, even if there are several windows, they do not face north, but are always tightly closed and not often opened. Moreover, a stove has been lit in the house. Through a window, separated from the world, I have not forgotten the world at the same time, only blocking it with a layer of glass. Looking out the window, the earth is desolate, and there is no excellent scenery. The branches of the ruined trees tremble in the dark sky.</p>
<p>At this time, the window has less leisurely interest for you and more gloomy feelings. Because there is a dim sky outside the window, because of the misty dusk under the sway of wind and rain, because another year is approaching its end, you will inevitably have a slight, smoky thought. Towards the hazy window outside, where small snowflakes are falling, your thoughts suddenly become unusually heavy.</p>
<p>In the night, it is silent, only letting the wind shake the window, the glass frame rattling, breaking through the still air in the room. Besides this, there is no other sound. And a person listens intently. The sound waves, sometimes heavy and sometimes light, cause one's thoughts to rise and fall like the tide. This disturbance will keep you tossing and turning until late at night, unable to sleep, even enduring until dawn in a pile of desolate and unbearable illusions. It, the window hit by the wind, often has times that make you suffer like this. But you cannot lack a window after all. When dawn breaks, a faint ray of light shines through the window, telling you that it is morning. When dusk comes, the light on the window gradually dims, you glance outside, and the thick haze embraces the earth, and you know that night has come.</p>
<p>The house I am currently living in does not even have a window with the worst direction. When I raise my eyes, my sight is blocked by wooden boards on all sides. It is like being hidden in a dark cellar, losing the window's revelation of time, and completely unaware of how the day begins and when it gets dark. This life is like groping in the eternal night, making me eagerly pursue even a window with an extremely bad direction.</p>

<p>— Bai Xi</p>
<p>It is time for school dismissal again. The principal of XX Private Elementary School, Le Sitong, has a thousand knots in his stomach and is so anxious that his eyes are red! He finally managed to get through a semester. In this semester, he was actually able to live through it; it is a truth he can't understand no matter how hard he tries.</p>
<p>Everyone has self-esteem, especially the young Principal Le Sitong. But for this elementary school, no, for being unwilling to leave the innocent and pure children, he has endured the insults and scolding of the creditors. He, shamelessly, humbly, even almost kneeling, speaks kindly to the creditors... Heaven! I can't think about everything anymore! Let the past be the past! How to deal with the immediate difficulties?</p>
<p>At present: he is busy with the semester exams, but through these semester exams, isn't his miserable fate nakedly revealed? Recently, he has been particularly good to the young students. Even if they have a little bit of rule-breaking behavior, he advises them kindly, not like he used to use a stern attitude to severely reprimand them. Why is this? Isn't it because the semester is about to end, and he is deeply afraid that they will switch schools?</p>
<p>Every time a young student has been kindly advised by him, he regrets it and hates himself. Why am I making such a lowly action? Am I not a mentor to the children? If children make mistakes, they must be severely reprimanded! Yes, I have insulted the children's personality! I am treating the children as commodities! Alas! Ah!...</p>
<p>Le Sitong, this young principal, hangs his head to his chest. He really wants to cry his heart out. But he suddenly thinks: hasn't he often heard a burst of whispering gossip among the elementary school students recently?</p>
<p>"Hey! XX school's tuition is two yuan!"</p>
<p>"Ours here is five yuan!"</p>
<p>"Too expensive!"</p>
<p>The world has indeed progressed a lot! The concepts of "expensive" and "cheap" have been clearly understood by the children! Alas! A new elementary school has opened in the alley next door, charging only two yuan for tuition. Look! Recruitment advertisements are plastered all over the alleys. The four words "two yuan tuition" are so striking! Not counting the big advertisements, they also go door-to-door to distribute flyers, saying things like: "This school, in view of the recent economic downturn," "This school, in order to promote universal education, charges only two yuan for tuition," and so on, pulling on a big pile. Heaven! Nowadays, parents find it difficult to earn money. Who wouldn't want to send their children to an elementary school with low fees?... But in this way, Principal Le Sitong is worried to death!</p>
<p>In addition to the blow of "two yuan tuition," Principal Le Sitong is also suffering from the blow of the "Notice to Parents" flyer. The content of the flyer says: Schools that are not registered are unreliable. Often, people falsely use the name of running a school, collect a bunch of tuition fees, and "run away." Therefore, please do not send your children to study at schools that have not been registered... Of course, this negative article is to tell people to send their children to registered schools!... But in this way, Principal Le Sitong is even more worried to death!</p>
<p>Looking at the group of elementary school students in front of him, Principal Le Sitong's head is dizzy! To the left of his school alley is a newly opened school that only charges "two yuan tuition," and to the right is a registered school!... Heaven!</p>
<p>He hates himself for accommodating the students, but he has to accommodate the students. He hates himself for promoting to the students like a merchant, saying: "Our school teaches well," but he has to promote to the students like a merchant, saying: "Our school teaches well"! He hates himself, even hates his wife, children, father, mother, and, by extension, he hates his children. Without them, wouldn't he not have to say those words?</p>
<p>But he still has to live... He is wrong! He mocks his lack of awareness. But he hates himself even more because he is cowardly.</p>
<p>The time for school dismissal is approaching day by day.</p>

<p>Opening Chapter "Dream of the Red Chamber, Daiyu's Return to Heaven"</p>
<p>The deafening drums and music are as noisy as the tide. In the Grand View Garden, there are many voices. It turns out that, Brother Bao is getting married tonight. Servants are running back and forth, each on their own errands. Little do they know that Lin Daiyu, in Xiaoxiang Pavilion, is terminally ill and emaciated. Only Zijuan and Xueyan are loyally serving her. No one visits, and she is doubly lonely. The girl, her liver fire is rising, her cheeks are red, and her whole body is in pain, difficult to describe. Her breath is as fine as a gossamer, on the verge of death. Zijuan is so anxious that her limbs are weak, and her heartstrings seem to be burning with fierce fire. She thinks of Mother Li, who is usually a good person. She orders a little maid to invite her from Daoxiang Village. Li Wan, hearing this, gets up and comes to visit with great concern. Seeing her, her teeth are clenched and difficult to open, her eyes are slightly open and her lips are moving slightly. Her mind is unclear and she is dizzy for a long time. Zijuan and Li Wan cry sadly. As the sun sets in the west and the bright moon shines, a lamp is as small as a bean, and the bamboo sways in the wind. The girl's illness has slightly recovered, and she opens her eyes to look. She can drink the tea and beckons with her hand. She says to Zijuan, "My friendship with you is as close as hands and feet, and I call you my confidante. I have something important to ask you to do. I am as flawless as white jade. Tell them to send me home for a visit." Saying this, her breath becomes rapid, her hands and feet are as cold as ice, and she is covered in cold sweat. The pupils in her eyes have lost their light, and her fists are clenched tightly. Zijuan's tears have been flowing non-stop. Her heart is cut like a knife, and she cries sadly. Li Wan and Tanchun also arrive. Hearing her, she repeatedly uses her strength to call out "Bao Yu." Alas, as soon as she says "Goodbye," she returns to heaven. In an instant, the jade is lost and the fragrance is gone. She returns to the Land of Sorrow to become an immortal.</p>

<p>Sino-Western (1040) 12:15 AM to 1:00 AM</p>
<p>Opening Chapter "Gold and Beauty"</p>
<p>What in the world easily moves the heart? I fear it is gold and beauty. Gold can take away a commoner's will. A beauty's words are like an imperial edict. Look at the many young people who are suffering setbacks, also for gold and beauty. Remember that Xiang Yu, the hero of Chu, committed suicide at Wujiang. He was reluctant to part with his beautiful Yu. Look at the corrupt officials who compete for power. They are constantly thinking about gold. Some are fighting with their brothers over gold. Some are harming others for wealth. Some are making enemies of their loved ones for gold. Some are separating husband and wife for gold. Some are losing their conscience in an instant for gold. Some are losing their integrity and bodies for gold. Gold, I think you are an evil spirit with supreme power. I don't know how many people you have harmed. I see you turning black and white upside down with great power. So it is that gold can buy a beauty's heart. Look at the beauties of ancient times, who have great magical power, not only overturning the country but also overturning the city. Remember that in the Romance of the Three Smiles, Tang Jieyuan was affectionate for a beauty. In the Double Pearl Phoenix, Wen Bizheng sold his body and relied on the heavenly official's door. He didn't want to be a scholar, but was willing to be a lowly person. Don't laugh, don't look down on him. What's wrong with being fond of beauty and loving beauties? Beauty, I hate you for bullying others with your power. I hate you for only valuing clothes and not valuing people. Because of you, compatriots have differences of opinion. Because of you, fathers and sons actually quarrel. I think, if there were no gold in the world, thieves would not be rampant. If there were no gold in the world, countries could not only be strong but also be healthy. If there were no gold in the world, why snatch inheritances and harm lives? If there were no gold in the world, good families would not revolt. All because of the glittering gold that dazzles people's eyes. All because of the beauty that stirs up greed. Look at the men who are greedy for lust in nineteen out of ten cases, and the women who have always loved gold and silver. Therefore, gold and silver are in love with each other. For whom do so many heroes die? As countless as the sands of the Ganges, they die for these two things. They act as tyrants and play with people.</p>

<p>"Love Letter," written and directed by Li Pingqian, starring Ye Qiuxin, Gu Lanjun, Wang Zhengxin, Sun Min, etc., is an all-dialogue singing sound film, depicting the suffering of young men and women, love disputes, and reflecting the social economic downturn, pointing out the proper way out for young people. Li Pingqian's previous directorial works have always been known for their delicate style. In order to make the title more in line with the content of the story, "Love Letter" has now been renamed "Peach and Plum Contending for Beauty." Judging from this title, it is not difficult to imagine how wonderful and erotic the play is. It is said that the name "Peach and Plum Contending for Beauty" has been approved by the Central Film Inspection Committee.</p>

<p>—In "After the Calamity, Peach Blossoms"—</p>
<p>Probably about a month ago, an old couple came to the Star Photography Studio to see the filming of "After the Calamity, Peach Blossoms." Hao Tian photographed Xu Xinyuan and his old lady (played by Shu Xiuwen). Before the outbreak of the Qingdao war, the couple said goodbye. Shu Xiuwen got up and closed the window, turned around and sat on the big sofa, and gently called Xu Xinyuan: "Come, sit here with me!" So the two of them sat together intimately. Shu Xiuwen stared at him blankly, as if she had a lot to say in her heart. Suddenly, she laughed to herself, reached out and took Xu Xinyuan's hand and said: "Actually, I don't have anything to say to you. We have been talking for more than thirty years. We have said a lot. Come and sit closer to me, take my hand, let's just sit like this for a while!"</p>
<p>The old couple sat hand in hand silently, like young lovers. This scene is moving and interesting. Mr. Lao She has a short story called "Romance in Old Age" - this "Romance in Old Age" scene, seen by an old couple watching the filming next to them, felt so familiar and laughed at each other.</p>
