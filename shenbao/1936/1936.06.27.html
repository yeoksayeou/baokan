<h3>日澳貿易戰的展開</h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>自從上月二十二日澳洲政府宣佈新關稅政策提高日本輸入澳洲的人造絲織物和棉織物的進口稅以後日本也於本月二十五日援用通商擁護法對澳洲輸入的羊毛和小麥採取輸入許可制度加以限制這不但使去年開始的日澳通商會議完全陷入破裂的狀態且使日益尖銳的日澳貿易戰更加白熟化了</p>
<p>澳洲是大英帝國領土的一部份是英國資本和商品輸出的重要對象它又是構成英鎊集團的一份子它的貨幣制度的安定與吾是和英鎊息息相關的近年以來它受世界不景氣洪流的激盪至存在倫敦的現金準備逐漸减少財政上漸有入不敷出之感而澳幣在倫敦市塲的匯價也有下落之可能它爲嚴密英鎊集團的陣容起見便採取這種新關稅政策來維持英國工業品的輸出巿塲穩定澳幣在倫敦市塲的匯價新關稅政策給予日本對澳貿易影響最大的便是入造絲織物和棉織物稅率的提高新關稅率規定人造絲織物的一般稅率每方碼徵九便士對英國則依特惠關稅每方碼僅徵一便士半棉繼物的一般稅率每方碼徵最低二便士又四分之一最高三便士又二分之對英國也依特惠關稅每方碼概徵半便士或從價百分之五這種新關稅實施以後顯然會使輸澳日貨受很火的打擊無法和受特惠關稅待遇的英貨爭取市塲的</p>
<p>日本受到這種打擊自然要有所報復報復的唯一辦法就在限制澳洲羊毛和小麥的輸入羊毛和小麥是澳洲的主要產物而日本是它的大主顧去年日本從澳洲輸入的羊毛總額達一萬八千二百萬元小麥達三千零九十萬元前者占輸入額的百分之九　後者佔百分之七一都立於獨佔的地位所以它以爲祗要限制澳洲羊毛和小麥的進口便可使澳洲受到重大的損失逼得它放棄新關稅政策的其實這個武器並不是了不得的法寳先就羊毛而言它不但是紡織工業所必需就在軍需工業中也是少不得的日本限制羊毛進口不但要影響軍需工業的膨脹且要减少紡織工業的輸出這不啻是對外貿易的自殺雖然它在限制澳洲羊毛進口的反面可以向阿根庭或南菲購買羊毛但運費和貨幣換算的損失要使它的成本比向澳洲購買貴上六分之一這樣鉅大的損失將由誰來負擔何况阿根庭和南菲又都是構成英鎊集團的份子呢至於小麥雖也可向澳洲以外的小麥生產者購買但小麥生產者美國和阿根庭今年小麥歉收事實上恐也沒有剩餘可以供給日本其能供給日本的祗有加拿大但是日本倘向加拿大購買則不但成本每百斤要貴上六角且加拿大也是英鎊集團的一份子實際上又有甚麽效果呢</p>
<p>無疑的澳洲的新關稅政策是受英國的策動的因爲日本紡織工業的進展已經使英國在太平洋的霸權感受到無上的威脅這决羅斯離日的時候日本記者團在橫濱問他英國除希望和日本合作向中國投資外是吾還願使日本在別的國家通商而羅斯的答復是日本要在其他各國得到通商的便利最好能先反省不要去作無益的競爭這是很露骨地表示着英國是已凖備與日本作貿易上的决戰了現在日本的對外貿易到處都受着阻遏不但澳洲對它如此就是美國和荷屬印度等都在提高對日貨的關稅這常然是日本的不幸但他也决不會默爾而息的我們相信它的應戰方略除强硬地要求平分世界巿塲外更會加緊作獨占中國巿塲的工作所以日本在貿易戰爭中所受的損失也有轉嫁到我們的身上的可能</p>

而爲不孕之原因。治法當隔晚用療帶靈一片。納入膣道。用法簡便。並無任何流弊。最宜於在家秘密自療。如因丈夫傳染淋病而患白帶。除行此外治法外。可同時内服「安敵淋」驅逐淋菌。其因體虚及經病者。可與「女用生殖素」同時内服。愈其衰弱。調經補血。故「療帶靈」一藥。實爲婦女患白帶者。自療之捷徑。凡素患白帶病者。其注意焉。安全戒烟經騐談　　狄思威路馮君云（上略）余自吸烟成癮後。因種種不便。百計求戒。然終以痛苦百出。半途而廢。去年因政府決心禁烟。儕輩咸紛紛求戒。余見友人楊君戒時精神愉快。非如其他戒烟者有痛苦者可比。即竊詰其本末。始知楊君在戒期內服用「生殖素」故毫無病痛。且精神百倍。身體壯健。即亦向五洲藥房購服之。約服一月左右。烟癮既火情。體重增加。在戒期內精神愉快。戒斷後見烟自厭。泃戒烟之奇劑也。藥性報告  劉志民醫師　　未老先衰　　患者耿君：秉賦不足。柔弱多病。失於調理。身更瘦削。年方壯盛。神態已似衰邁。腰痠背疼。諸症雜呈。今春由至友介紹服用「生殖素」為期衹三星期。各症盡去。回覆壯健。重返當年青春豐姿云。　　白濁便數　　患者陸君：酒後誤涉花叢。致染白濁。便數刺痛。苦不堪言。誤服廉價劣藥。失去療治病機。化為慢性。合併症迭出。後服白濁特效名藥「安敵淋」。服後檢尿。漸見澄清。即安連服數盒。濁淨身健。回復生機。上月來所談及。知其夫人已懷孕多月云。　　骨痛戒烟　　戒者秦君：染癮久遠。屢次求戒。均以因罹有骨節痠痛。難竣全功。春初由詹念會醫師介紹服「強斯登氏骨痛片」愈其骨痛。服「生殖素」以安全戒烟。同時並注射「育維賜保命」以資補助。使戒烟縮短。未及一月。毒除癮斷。回覆從來未有之壯健云。性病講座  詹念曾醫師　姚爾昌博士合編　　（診所）四川路北京路轉角中國信託公司二樓（門診）上午十時至下午六時。星期日休息。　　（一）手淫早婚子嗣艱難　　患者奚君。年三十九歲。崇明人。工界。奚君一傷於手淫。再傷於早婚。秉質既薄。操勞又過度。以致身體孱弱。罹有性促之患。二十年來。並無生育。因循徬徨。以為莫治。去年秋間。由同事介紹。始自投敝處求治。經余等告以攝生保養之道。施用最新科學手術電氣療法。並囑服生殖腺素製劑。連服數盒。頓覺身體壯實。腰背有力。體滿精厚。回覆青春。性促一症。根本治療。夫妻感情。勝於新婚。清明節前余以專訪某工程師。與奚君不謀而遇。據云其夫人已懷孕多月云。　　（二）遺精健忘腰痠背痛　　患者石君。年二十三歲。吳縣人。學界。石君早歲中淫書之毒。誤犯自凟惡癖。多載　伐。　喪頗烈。以致身體虧損。罹有遺精夢洩之症。初常一月數次。繼竟一月達十餘次之多。虧憊不堪、學業銳退。漸至失眠健忘。腰痠背痛諸症。紛起雜乘。後由其表兄介紹。於去冬十月中旬。來敝處求治。經施用電波感應療法。並投用固精良劑固其精關。治其遺精。未幾即告斷根。並為培補其虧損起見。喂購服生殖腺素製劑。約服一月有餘。頓覺回覆青春。夜得安眠。記憶力恢復。腰背有力。學業猛晉。身壯體健。宛如另換一重人格云。　　（按）生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」治衰弱聞性病有殊效。固精名藥「希米脫氏固精片」專治遺精夢洩失眠不安等症。花柳科戒烟科臨診述例  香港醫科大學醫學學士吳大超　　白濁骨痛苦楚艱堪　　白濁淋菌　如不及早治療。則其毒內竄。併發睪丸炎腫骨節痠疼等症。子嗣維艱。康健難享。病變百出。苦莫甚也。　　余治本症。嘗用最近新發明之黃色素內服製劑。取其與黃色素注射有異曲同工之妙。而無注射時一切副作用之流弊也。　　最近余投用「安敵淋」以治愈馬君潘君之急生慢性淋濁。等險症。而以「強斯登氏骨痛片」治癒黃君郭君之淋濁性關節炎及骨節痠痛等症。為期均未逾一月云。（按）各藥永安公司中西太和各大藥房均售。　　遠年烟癮夫妻並戒　　烟癮之成。係由鴉片慢性中毒而起。吸者生殖腺素形成缺乏。全身失去本來良好之營養。而全恃鴉片麻痺興奮之力。以求振刷於一時。原非正常。如一且求戒。則牽動慣性。全身即感種種之不舒適。如原有胃痛等病者。則至是亦一一湧現。癮毒病痛。相連相關。戒治偏失。即難竣全功。此其所以戒者往往半途廢止也。　　抑戒烟之法。除毒固要。而生殖腺素之補充。尤為對症發藥當務之急。增其抵抗力。烟毒不除自去。故安全戒烟法。舍生殖腺素無他求矣。　　春末有嚴君夫婦並來求戒。余分別令用男用女用「生殖素」以除毒斷癮。起衰強身。至於胃痛白帶。則內服「胃痛靈」外用「療帶靈」以治之。病痛既治。戒烟更屬安全。同時並注射「育維賜保命」以補助之。故咸得將戒烟縮短至不及一月云。</p>

<p>申報婦女專刊國家興亡匹婦有責  芝雲　　國家興亡。匹夫有責，這是一句古話，自然是含有極深長的意義的，更其是在這內憂外息，交相侵迫的非常時期中更覺得其價値的偉大。不過我們站在客觀的立場上照來，二十世紀的婦女，也是不能不負起對於國家興亡的相當之責的。在這裏，我並不是主張二十世紀的婦女，也該像男子那麽的換下了長袍穿起了軍服，肩上負起了武器，上前錢去。我所希望於婦女們是努力於最下層的根本工作。　　第一，是屛絕奢華，革除一切歲榮的惡習。從今天起，不燙髮，不搽粉，不塗胭脂，不穿不買高貴的衣服或衣料，節省着無謂的支出，而把節省下來的金錢，儲蓄起來，以備將來以國運作孤法一擲時，捐贈給政府購軍械儲糧食，或作安定金融之用。在意阿戰爭時，意國婦女紛以婚戒捐贈給政府，這是何等偉大的一件事？我們中國的婦女，若能於必要時，大家很慷慨地把積蓄捐給政府，那豈非是極有意義的一件事？　　第二，是生活習慣的改造。晚上早眠，淸晨早起，養成壯健的體格，以備在需要時，出而負荷一切艱鉅的工作。打牌，聽書，跳舞，觀電影，等一切無裨實際的享樂，應極端的屛絕。把空閒的光陰，完全消費在運動與讀書上面。運動的目的，是在於增强體力，讀書的目的，是在於增加智識。在第一次歐洲大戰時，法國的男子，紛紛被徵人伍，於是後方的農工商各業，甚至於政府機關中，都有不在少數的婦女，在替着男子們工作。因為伊們都有壯健的體格，豐富的學問，所以一切工作，都能很順利地進行着。這一層，在將來，難道我們的婦女，不能麽？假使能及早努力，我想是决不會讓法國婦女，專美於前的。　　第三，是丈夫與子女的敎養。一般的婦女，對於丈夫，大都是愛護備至，體貼入微的。在夫婦之道上說來，這自然是很合理的。但是處於目前的這個局勢之下，負着與亡之責的匹夫，絕對的不能養成閒適的習慣的，因為任誰在將來，是不免於要上前綫去走一遭的。上前綫去的生活，絕對不是茶來伸手，飯來開口者所能忍受的，因此，我以為每一個婦女，都該有誘致丈夫，每天在家中，操作勞役若干分鐘，或一二小時的義務。這並不是對於丈夫的不敬，這正是所以養成丈夫耐勞的習慣。對於子女，也該如此。若是一味的姑息，那麼，將來負起了一根槍桿兒，便得累得喘不過氣來，更怎樣說得上為國效力？　　上述的三個問題，雖然瞧着不過是有關於主婦的私生活的家庭問題，但是我却以為這正是有關於國家光亡的匹婦的重大之責。我希望在這二十世紀中的中國婦女，加以注意。現代的健康女性  闌刪　　最近南京金陵女子文理學院，發起選舉「金陸健康小姐」運動，其動機係在喚起女界改正其以前以弱為美的錯誤觀念，而標示出現代的女性美的典型來。這在我國還是破題兒第一遭，而其實應該早就要舉行了的。　　我們不能再相信那些捧心的西子會在今日佔得健而美的地位，病態的美人現在是落伍了，工愁善病，楚楚可憐的女性，只是被贊賞於古式的時代，病弱的國家的，伊們如今已沒有做現代的母親的資格了。我們需要健而美的女性產將來的孩子們都要被，生於健康的母性。我們的祖母和母親都太孱弱了。　　但也怪不得前代的母親們之樂於趨好病而弱的體格，只能怪那些過往的歷代帝皇罷了，他們是玩弄女性的能手，什麽慘無人道的把戲都想得出來，以為伊們的腰肢細瘦當必悅目，便使無慮千萬的女兒們都去束起胸紮起腰來，必至柳腰欵擺，身輕如燕，而又掌上可舞時纔算美人。又以為伊們姍姍行路定有可觀，便得要那些女兒們含着酸淚而纏足，六寸圓膚定要纏到不滿三寸，可以放在小醬油碟裏。走起來要娉婷婀娜，如風吹楊柳般的，纔呌做體態輕盈。如此障礙着伊們身體上自然的發育，孱弱多病，便是那時代的女性的象徵。　　現代的女性已從舊禮敎之束縛下漸次解放了，纏足束胸，列成禁例，除風氣未開的內地鄉村還是墨守着不良的成法外，其餘差不多巳經覺悟了。雖然如此，但還有些是羞羞澀澀地，對於自己解放了的部份覺得怪難為情似的，這是太昧於生理的敎訓了。更有一層，伊們以為如此解放了，便算達到了健康的目的，而不求進步，所以仍是半孱弱的。（你們沒有看見那些雄糾糾氣昂昂的西女西婦麽？伊們何嘗有着這　一種忸怩之態？伊們纔是健而美的女性，强國的國民，强健的孩子們的母親！）　　然而我們這裏又有一輩舍本逐末的摩登女性，只知道喊解放，而自己實在是不解放，打倒一個舊的桎梏，而又給一個新的桎梏所困，—那就是穿着三四寸高後跟的鞋子，以為這樣纔見得婀娜多姿，不知這適足以妨碍着身體的平衡的發展，—而允足以傷害小腦部份的健康，這比之纏足亦猶五十步之笑百步耳。　　現在金陵女子文理學院之選舉健康小姐，便拿出「各部器官之健全，全身姿勢之正確，舉動自然，精神活潑，」為健康之標準，（而不佞以為尙可加進「思想純正，意志堅定」一條，以糾正其以前一本柔弱，思想飄忽的習氣，未知金大諸女同學以為如何？）這是再簡單也沒有了的，然而能達到這水準，怕也不是易事，此决選舉與被選舉入，雖只限於該校所有師生，未為普遍。但此舉亦不過開風氣之先，正有待於各處各女校的風起雲從，一唱百和；更由各女校推進到社會上各婦女團體各家庭中去，使一向只知有病態美的，或半孱弱的，和舍本逐末的女性，都認淸健康之美何在，而羣向此目標加意鍜鍊，使二萬萬女同胞，一致走上健康之路，則來日大難，正好本「男女平等」之義，共同担負起一分責任來，是豈唯一人一家之幸，抑亦我中華民國漸近於，强盛的一大轉機。　　上海不乏熱心婦運的人，本市「健康小姐」「健康少奶」之選，甚盼能於最短期間，隨金陵女學院之後而實現。徽州的女人  鄭康伯　　徽州的女人是一種標準的女性，勤儉，耐勞，努力操作是伊們的優點；樸素，强悍是伊們的特徵。　　徽州是個多山的地方，因此，伊們有關生的時間生活在山上，也可以說，山上是伊們重要的操作的地方。至於伊們的室內工作是極簡單的，日常，除了掃灑，縫紉外，其它就並沒有什麽重要的工作，至於孩子，原都是野孩子，在五歲以上的，除了家境較好的能進私塾讀一二年書外，家境比較壞的惟有幹放牛或閒逛去了，所以說，徽州的孩子自幼受的是自然的敎養，父母對於他們的關係猶是膚淺的，而一般母親，兒童敎育這樣的字樣在伊們也是極生疏的。　　至於室外工作，那眞是煩極了，春天，得上山採茶，然後製茶；春末夏初的時候，梨樹（徽州也是產梨的地方）的梨實正是逐步發大的時候，為了避免一切禽獸的傷害，於是製成一個個的紙袋，雇人以袋將一隻隻梨實包起來，這工作名「包梨」。包梨以後，每晚便須睡在山上的草棚內了。因為夏日的深夜，常有成羣的禽獸來竊食將熟的梨，所以住在山上，以求管理梨園便利，每天夜裏，很晚很晚的時候，她們偶然聽到一些微聲，」便知道這是山獸的來臨，於是便爬起來吆喝着，追逐着。秋天，正是無邊木葉蕭蕭下的時候，於是每天晨晚，都到山上去收羅木葉，冬天，是伊們所樂的季節，這工作是更其繁重了。　　徽州的女人還都是纏足的，而且截髮的還也絕無僅有，然而，那外鄉人所最感到困苦的山路在伊們走來郤異常的輕快。徽州女人受敎育的機會是極少的，因自幼煩重的工作使伊們沒有受敎育的時間，在這樣的情形之下，伊們的婚姻的情形也可想而知了，而且，伊們結婚的年齡都在二十歲以前。　　也因為徽州的男人都經商在外，所以對內對外的事都由伊們兼管，好在那一帶的生活簡單，如何大的苦惱也是沒有的。幾種價廉物美的潤面劑和使用方法  少明　　一擰檬汁有些面膏裏，多有含檸檬汁的。檸檬汁原有美顏的功效，能令皮膚爽潔白凈，也能退痣除晦氣色。但耍注意，切不可用濃汁，須用淸水攙淡再用，每日可用兩决，任它沾滯在面上，愈久愈妙。洗去時宜用冷水，用久有不可思議的效力。　　二牛乳　好牛乳面上浮有一層厚酪，是潤面的妙品，可用匙撇取，每晚凈面後，將此酪勻搓面上，使透入皮內。再趁不甚乾時，加塗少許冷膏過夜，面皮便不感覺緊張。　　三燕麥粉　純凈生燕麥粉，用薄布縫小袋裝入此粉，每日沐浴時用以擦洗，最為滑澤。　　四麥　子　照用燕燕麥粉的法子，功效相同。（有一件須注意的，乳酪功能漂白。但與檸檬性格相反，所以二物切忌並用，用在一處，是有損而無益的）　　五橄欖油　用純橄欖油，或攙等分的酒精來擦皮膚，有除去皺紋的特長。　　六白滑石粉　這裏面含有充足的硼酸，用來搓洗頸項，可使皮膚舒暢。五寶  雪　　「這一回總該是沒有說的了」！隔壁吳家的新嫂嫂懷着一種很興奮的情緒向五寶的母親說了許多的話，最後便把這句很樂觀的話來做了結束。　　所謂新嫂嫂，其實已早就不新了；伊嫁到吳家來，前後差不多已有了十四五個年頭，便是伊一再很熱心地給伊這一位鄰居女友—袁家的五實—想做媒以來，也快要有六七年工夫了。可是到今天還沒有成功。難道說五寳長得太醜陋嗎？不，决不，當六七年前，五寳在××女學念書的時候，雖不曾給人家公推為校花，但至少是做過了幾任「級花」的；就是說目前，伊雖是二十八歲了，却還留着幾分的豐姿。那末五寳可是不識字的舊式女子嗎？不，决不，伊分明是一個中學畢業生。那末難道是五寳伊自己不願意對親嗎？不，决不，伊從來也不曾唱過獨身主義的高調。　　這樣說，究竟為着什麽呢？唯一的原故就是因為五寳個性太柔弱，不大敢自己做什麽主張，一切全讓伊那整日渴酒打花會的老母去安排，以致弄得事事尷尬了。難道這位老太太就不愛自己的女兒嗎？啊！那可別寃枉伊，伊是怪鍾愛五寶的。每當隔壁吳家新嫂嫂費了有多的力，拆了許多的心思，很善意地來給五寳做媒時，袁老太太總是說：　　「啊！人才是好的，可惜沒有家產，過幾年再談吧」　　「啊！家產是不少，可惜房份太多，五寳嫁過去是要吃苦的。再過幾年商量吧」？　　「啊！五寳自已雖是看對了，可惜他們成婚後就要上南京去做事，我老太婆太冷靜了。還是過幾年再談吧」　　「啊！那末就算决定了！聘禮却不能不先講講，至少要一副金鋼鑽鐲子，兩隻金鋼鑽戒子，一對金鋼鑽…………，如其他們不肯出，便再擱幾年商量吧」！　　幾年，幾年，…五寳已是三十二歲的人了，袁老太太開出口來，却還是「小孩子家」「小孩子家」的說得很順利；可是隔壁吳家新嫂嫂的一顆熱心已完全冷却了。當仁不讓  本報特寫潘公展夫人　唐冠玉女士論新賢妻良母  寄萍　　我的一位朋友說過一句很深刻的話：「你要看一個官吏的廉潔，只消考察三件事：第一，看他本人的進德修業，第二，看他的夫人是否賢慧；第三，看他們怎樣利用休閑的時間。」這三點都是扼要，只可惜現在的人禁不起這三層的推敲罷了。其實也不限於官吏，無論那一種人，要自己斷定他一身事業的成敗，部不可不想想這三件事。　　這裏，我來介紹一位　　玉女士，她是潘公展的夫人，是海上女畫家，也是國貨運動的熱心工作者。大家知道潘先生在黨政方面，已有相當的地位，到現在，他依然淸廉自守，不脫書生本色，雖說一個人的好壞，大半是自己做的，但人家說他得力於夫人之助的，也不算微渺。在這一點看來，就可證明我朋友的話，那也有幾分理由。我想一僩公務人員，允其高級官吏，他不但要自己做好人，就是他主待內政的夫人，也要聰明的用她的思想去鼓勵她的丈夫，奉公守法，勿營私舞弊，那末政治纔有澄淸的希望。近幾天　上不是載着南京某署長借公　私的新聞麽，如果他夫人有賢德的話，那裏肯幹犯法的事，這些廢話，暫且少說。　　潘夫人出身於南洋女子師範及啟明女學，國學頗有研究，後從馮超然先生學繪事，畫就是她維一的嗜好。憶昔年潘氏長社會局時，每逢國貨展覽及審查會事，夫人必熱心多加，前年為婦女國貨年，她　任主席委員，始終勿懈，貢獻獨多。今春他家遷居於巿中心區的翔殷路，前天我去訪問，看這所精緻的洋樓中一切的陳設佈置，我不出一件是洋貨，他們能說到做到，可算很難得的事。夫人說：「我自顧學力　　，不是以應世，平時除心理家務外，絕少對外交　，或發表言　，今承枉　，只能作為私人談話，幸勿　露。」所以我們談了半小時，而所能刊出的，只有以下三點：　　　夫人對社會上那一件事認為最感興趣？　　「我對於社會甚少服務，殊覺慚愧，不過平素頗喜種植。在理想中，以為最好能造成旣淸靜又美麗的鄕村，在道些鄕村中，設立優良的小學校，不但敎小學生，且可用為指導鄕村平民的機關。吾則像現在的學校，雖已設立，亦不過使小學生略知文字，還沒有收到很大的效用。」　　　服務社會的女子，必　何種條件？　　「第一須有强健體格，並辭去一切不適當的應酬。規定時間服務社會，但仍須規定時間整理家務，不可偏廢。至於會客，如無緊要事故，不必作無意思的長談，以免彼此躭誤光陰，允其對於事忙的人，格外要能互相原諒。對於親戚朋友，應和顏應付，使社會上大家有良好的感情，自然能彼此諒解，無事不成。」　　　怎樣才配稱做「新賢妻良母」？　　「新賢妻良母是民族復興運動　婦女們應有的道德標準，凡為母為妻者，應明白帮助丈夫，敎育子女，使他們都能為國家社會盡力，這就是自身的責任；但不能有絲毫希望丈夫子女一旦富貴，可以依賴的意念。要知一個國民是國家社會所公有的，不能據為私有。對丈夫要勉勵其進德修業，對子女應循循善誘。，不可本着封建時代的舊意識，把子女束縛得太嚴，否則子女們將失去對於慈母的情感，不敢再問長道短，喪失了天倫之樂。婚姻一事尤應給子女以自由，如事實上有必要時，或略加商酌亦可；對於兒媳，不應責望太深，俾家庭和睦的氣象可以永久保持。家庭和睦，就是大學所謂的「家齊」，「家齊而後國治」。如果全國做母親做妻子的人能够個個做到「家齊」，國家那有不治之理？這種母親和妻子，就是我們理想中的「新賢妻良母」。潘夫人之近作婦女須耐勞  蟄存　　婦女嬌惰成性，不耐勤勞，大都出自富貴人家。城市婦女又較鄕村為腌弱；而貧家婦女類能操作耐勞。其天足亦不始於近代，讀唐人一身兼作僕兩足白于霜之句，可見中國婦女，早能達出謀生，兼是天足。予有高郵道中詩云：攔河築壩濬兼疏，男婦齊翻吸水車，　　（時由馬棚澍築壩至高郵城，濬河四十里，遂改由陸行，沿途見男女千數百人，正在踏車吸水）幼婦似催人着力，艷妝笑唱鼓兒書，叉過高郵城中書所見云：鴉靑刷鬢煮金釵，脂粉勻施不着鞋，半截美人天足健，一肩担菜賣沿街）。他如大江南北兩岸附近各縣，其風俗素稱渾樸，婦人無專依其丈夫之倚賴性，洵足培閻閻元氣也獨身主義之錯誤（下）  月心　　上面這幾種思想是吾正確，我們現在暫且不論，不過現在我們先得把獨身主義拿出來解剖一下，看看裏面有沒有毒素：　　（一）獨身主義違反人類繁殖進化的原則　　我們早已講過人類全靠男女性的結合而繁殖而進化，但獨身主義者是明白拒絕這個原則。像山額夫人與馬丁夫人的節育主義一樣造成人口稀少的現象，或者有的人以為這樣倒可以把人的品質弄優良起來，不再受人口太多分配不勻的痛苦。但我們拿唯物的眼光考察一下：人類勞苦的有如此之多的原由，那未就不難看出一部份人的獨佔的現象，獨身主義比節育主義危害更大：　　（二）獨身主義者否認由兩性結合所生的新力量—　　獨身主義者最所看不入眼的就是兩性的結合，有的以為兩性的結合是新增一種痛苦，但這種種都不値一論，因為兩性在合理的完美的或從奮鬥出來的結合上，其由合作而生之新力量是不能抹殺的，道種新的興趣不是獨身主義者所能得到的。不過結合的美滿的一點是最重大的因素，但這却是另外一個問題啊！　　（三）獨身主義者必定是異於常態—　　這個異於常態是獨身的惡果；平常一個人受了刺激往往也要異於常態，亦獨身者方面伊不過為了一些小小的刺激，於是也實行了異乎常態的生活：在最初伊是不會覺到異常並且還以為是幸福，但到後來就發現種種不良現象：精神上陷入痛苦孤獨的深淵，由於精神影響到身體，於是對於一切事情感不到興趣，同時在生理上也好像受到一種壓制，生理的發展是由着常態進行的，但在獨身者方面這種進行的發展是受到了限制，於是叉由生理影響了心理，獨身者一定在這兩重矛盾裹打滾！　　獨身思想本身已經有着不少毒素，在一切受了刺激的獨身者，當然不會得到好的結果，在最初獨身主義者是覺得幸福的快樂的，但到最後這種毒素，就要發酵。　　我們碰到許多的姊妹，伊們有很多思想是傾向於獨身的以為獨身者是世界上最自由的人，於是伊們在這個時候對於婚姻是不願提及的，在學校中有的同學因為大家都把獨身主義，由於思想的相同而知己起來，由獨身的演變却入於同性愛的階段。這種現象是很多的，但這是一種變態，一種可怕的變態！　　所以我願意抱獨身思想的姊妹們快點覺悟，不要只看是一面，而忘了別一面的惡果！</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言縣長遊街  劍平　　辛亥革命建立了中華民國以來，便葬送了整個封建制度的帝皇專制。五四運動的文化革命也總算給封建殘餘以一個很大的打擊；最少也可以給一般割據的軍閥一個敎訓—民衆的制裁力是民主國家的一種最出色的武器。但是，封建殘餘是吾便完全沒有了哩？當然沒有這麽快。封建勢力還是在一般未開通的遠僻裏伸着他的魔手。在報紙的通信上，我們還很可以看到一些希奇古怪的醜事　　最近，也有這樣的醜事，而且是「為民父母」的縣長，「知法犯法」的醜態。據某報的長江一帶通信稿，有這麽一段。—玉門縣長在新年中做出了一件有趣味的事情。廢曆正月十五日，縣長突然用椅子作成「八人大轎的樣式，由八個人抬着，請了四十名駐軍前後擁護着，在正街上來回走了一遭，回頭縣政府呌玉門城廂居民每家出洋一角，全城共九百餘家，計洋將近百元，說是「迎春費」。　　從這段通信中，我們很可以想到，在一些舊小說所看到的「縣長遊街」那種類的怪劇。抬着了一乘「八人大轎」，前呼後擁地把我們的縣官大人看待成一個舊家庭和新家庭  齊家　　上面的一張挿畫，就是描繪着兩種家庭苦樂的不同。　　舊家庭因為不講衞生，所以人多疾病，醫藥費算下來眞是一筆鉅數。　　講衞生的新家庭，因為有衞生品送上他的門，雖然破點小費，但是他們家裏的人常能康健。　　請問：『府上是不是願意做一個新家庭呢？』夏令衛生信條　　（一）用「亞林奧水」澆酒居室各處，防疫殺菌，　　（二）用「亞林沙而」隨時洗手沐身，消毒護膚，</p>

<p>活菩薩那麽出巡，百姓都誠惶誠恐地在那裏高呼千歲·這情景想起來才使人好笑，想不到在民國成立後二十五年還有這一種類對人民擺官架子的事情出現·最近行政院有懲治貪官汚吏的辦法，那麽對於這一等「醜態百出」的縣長能够輕輕地放過嗎？　　如果，光是「縣長遊街」那倒不過是一幕地方行政上的怪劇，可是事情當然不會這樣單簡，可以醜態百出地在民衆面前作威作福，那當然也可以藉詞橫征暴飲·果然，這位玉門縣的縣長大人，他在「遊街」以後，便來一個「迎春費」，來勒索居民每家一角了·從這個，我們很可以想得到在「山高皇帝遠」的那些地方，封建勢力還是化裝成一些割據的軍閥存在着；同時我們更可以想到在這一等惜封建勢力來魚肉人民的地方官之下的善良百姓們，他們能够怎樣地過活哩？有地方責任的人，對這會有一點甚麽感想。野心  徐疾　　在一處腐奐的，黝黑的古城裏，被安排在另一種中世紀的，卑劣的生活中有二十來年之後，林敬先生確實是完完全全的改變了·那改變，不僅是因為在年青的，平廣的額上多添了幾條生活的刻痕；不僅是把二十年前的學生裝改成了長袍短套，不僅是把過去的磊落的，眞誠而愉快的，明朗的笑顏改成了人為的，諂媚敷衍的，陰險的微笑，不僅……不，總之，這不僅是一切外貌的，年齡的改變，而是一種本質的，內在的，整個的轉換·這於屬於時代的，生活的，世界與環境之敎育的……　　生活的敎育是熔爐中的火焰一般的啊，它也許可以把鐵塊變成鋼一類的東西，然而，它不是也會把另外一些物質化成灰爐的嗎？可是這事實有誰相信呢？至少，林敬先生自己是不承認的，他對生活始終有着一種野心，年靑時代有，現在不還是依舊「有」嗎？縱然有時候自己也覺得現在的他是與二十年前的他有一點說不出來的「差異」，然而那種感覺，在他，也還是糢糢糊糊的，而且現在不是已快上『半百」的人了嗎？而過去……過去，祇有二十幾啊·三十幾歲上的人，在他現在看來，多半是浮燥的，淺薄的·　　譬如說，從現在的「二十幾歲的人」們底身上看來，不依舊還可以發現多少年前的林敬先生自己的一二處的縮影嗎？那時候，在年靑的血液中是伺樣樣地有着一種奇怪的野心的，一處處地撞着，試騐着，奮鬥着·一處處地，企圖找出一些眞正的人間的歡笑—祗要是「眞」的，卽使是眼淚也好—又一處處地，追尋着入間的「眞實」與「正直」，想用自己底勞力公正地把生活弄好起來，想像一正野牛一樣的，在荒凉的土地上奔跑，用自己底堅實的足蹄把這崎嶇的土路耕平·然而，這「野心」，現在看起來，是都麽「幼稚而可笑」，都麼近於不「聰明」的空想啊·世界依然號麼荒凉可怕，日子依然那麼糟，而個人的可愛的年靑時代的「野心」則顯得那麽渺小·這樣，林敬先生從年靑的時代走了出來，壯年了，中年了，他是被這卑汚的社會所敎育着，被自己的無能與不智所敎育着，在這腐臭了的古城市裹繁息了二十年—那是個長長的時候呀—於是在另一種熔爐中，林敬先生一天天地學習着，他遷就妥恊了，他學會了隨和與敷衍，而這一切，對於我們這個不智的世界與年頭是有用的呀·於是小小的古城中便也有了林敬先生那麼一個人—紳士，書記官，科長，校董與慈善家……日子跟着聲名一天天地好起來，而人間的「眞實」的與「正直的」，則變得一天天地模糊起來，最後，在年月的消蝕中褪了色，被遺忘了·　　而今，林敬老先生底野心依舊是有的，然而，據說是擺脫了靑年時代的「優氣與淺薄」（？），而變得更「深刻」（—）了·無論如何，生活是好的，世界是花團錦簇的，而把自己底生活弄得好起來—興旺起來，發達起來，顯耀起來—是必要的·卽使微小，那却是「實際」的啊，「有好處」的啊·　　於是，這生活上的「野心」，把他好遠好遠開拉開去，使他和眞實的靑年告了別；如今是半百的人了，是中年了啊·中年人除掉自己是不會想到其他的·正如所有的中年人一樣，林敬先生底野心，如今是屬於一個不智的人類的了：拋掉了一切可愛的夢想，他不苟地照着那新的「野心」活下去，諂媚也好，卑汚也好，然而總有一天，林敬先生底聲名會更大起來的，財產目錄上的數字會增加起來的，姨太太底媚笑是會更嫵媚起來的，生活上的享受是會更好起來的·　　一切眞是與過去不同了—一切都有了一個大大的改變·　　那生活的野心是……「深刻」的了…蚊陣  吳豐桓　　小時在學校里念過一課「舊金山的蚊陣」，那課文把「蚊陣」說得又兇又嚇入！連我們全班從沒有受過「蚊陣」的害處的同學們也都憎惡忿恨起蚊子來·不知怎的？惟有我却感到了「蚊陣」的神秘可愛，也許我們那里蚊子稀少了的緣故？本來我們海濱一帶，一年到頭颭着海風，蚊子大概是不喜歡來的？但是我不能相信我們這地方會沒有「蚊陣」？不過別人沒有發現而已·這麼以來我就抱定野心要去發現牠：在夏季的每個黃昏後，我背着家里的大人們，自己偸的偷跑到村外去，那地方離海較遠，草塲上，禾田中，樹林里，河邊，菜園……到處我都去找尋，啊，別扭得很，總找不到「蛟陣」！然我並不氣餒，我右那些地方徘徊到黑夜，因為自己想冒險做這個大發現，所以並不感覺得害怕，胆子實在壯哪·當家里入們發覺不見了我，就都慌了，四下里去找尋，父親跳駡着母親，母親幾乎是哭着喊我：「阿桓！」把整個村莊驚動了！等到我回到母親跟前時，渾身已經有些露濕了·這一夜祖母把我藏在她房里，才沒有給父親責打·第二决發生這事時，父親氣得像一條野牛，生生的把我打了個半死·打那時起，我再不敢出去尋覓「蚊陣」，皮肉的苦痛使我絕望的拋棄了好奇心·現在我才明白了在我們濱海地方是絕對沒有「蚊陣」的·　　十四歲那年伯父把我帶到大連去，到大連不久他就把我跟弟弟送進靑年會暑期學校·那學校里有各種不同國際的人，中國人，日本人，朝鮮人，台灣人，還有常常給日本孩子奚落的白俄人·乍時都很生疏冷淡，日子不長，大家就親熟起來·他們的中國話說得相當流利，所以我們很和得來，在課後我們跑到海邊上遊逛，講故事，其中就牽扯到「蚊陣」·瓦浪斯基在我們當中最會講故事的一個孩子，他給我們講了一個烏克蘭的「蚊陣」的故事·大意是：在烏克蘭南部的地方，那里每到夏天就有「蚊陣」，人們及牲畜都要用防蚊的工具，吾則就會被蚊陣弄死·有一决一個農夫喝醉了酒，夜里躺在天井里，第二天早晨便死去，死後別人發現他身上有無數血點，才知道是給蚊子殺害了·」這故事很非不近情理，簡直可以說是捏造的，可是瓦浪斯基說他老祖母對他講的决不是自己編排的·　　等我到北平看到「蚊陣」時，我便不以為神秘了·城外髒汚的地方，夜里總有許多「蚊陣」，允其是永定門，德盛門外靠近大糞塲的地方，那「蚊陣」確乎可怕·天一黑就看到家家戶戶弄出烟來驅「蚊陣」·城里完全不同，少數的蚊子是有的，但沒有白蛤子厲害·　　現在我是留身在上海了，夏天還未來之前，我曾詢問過朋友們，他們不知道什麽「蚊陣」啦，祇說：「你不必担心，霞飛路一帶隨便你住哈地都沒有蚊子的·」但春天剛過我却離開了霞飛路一帶，跑到徐家匯去住，為了生活我就在接近鄉下的地方生活着了·　　我們的門前是一片綠油油的草塲，淸晨和黃昏都有人來散步，也許人們貪戀着新鮮空氣罷？有些男女竟在草地上從黃昏玩到天黑·天一黑，這里就不是平靜地方了，遠遠的從南邊的汚水阿里飛來了怕人蚊陣，嗡嗡佔據了草塲，不斷向人們進攻，大家都是不抵抗的離開了這里·　　我自己雖然可以離開草塲，但不能不到屋里睡覺，然而我的屋子完全被「蚊陣」包圍了，我剛睡着就給牠們咬醒，剛睡着就給牠們咬醒，一夜我可以醒來七八次·睡眠整個給牠們粉碎了，我不能驅逐牠們！蚊香我也貝來用了，那效力太少，只不過多破費幾個銅板而已·每夜我皮膚上生出疙瘩來，明知是蚊子殺害我，但我沒法子，除非我有錢弄架帳子可以抗抵「蚊陣」·祖母的小鷄  華木　　家裏常年都養雞，平日做菜用的雞蛋就是取給於那幾隻母雞的·雞多了，又頑皮，常常撒了滿地雞矢，抓翻事物，有時也眞覺得討人厭·母親是有好潔癖的，為了一隻雞在廚房裏搗亂，往往拿起掃把任性的驅逐，打得那些雞亂飛高呌；祖母看見了，自然要談話，常常引得人家發笑·　　雞都是祖母一手養起來的，那一隻母雞會生蛋，那一隻會孵子，那一隻脾氣壞，那一隻馴良，這些事情祖母都非常熟悉·我每回回去·碰着傍晚飼雞，祖母就會一手柱着拐杖，一手指點着正在啄食的雞，給我毫無遺漏的說述起來，加之小弟妹們的添鹽加味，對於這些雞也就更外覺得親切有趣，使我回想起自已幼時的情形來·　　祖母雖然那樣愛養雞，成績可是很壞的·她相信什麽「血財」，總把這方面</p>
<p>Page 21</p>
<p>Page 22</p>
<p>Page 23</p>
<p>的失敗歸之於自己的「血財」不好·只　一次，那是我出世的頭年，她孵了兩窩子雞，竟一隻也不缺少養到一斤多大·提起這事，卽不愛雞的母親，也會很高興的凑上來說·不遇這三十多隻一斤多大的雞，到底還是給小偸在一個夜裏整籠的偸了去，痛惜之餘當然又是怪自己的「血財」不好·這個故事，每回孵小雞祖母總要翻來重述一番，末後又加上一個反解的尾巴，算作這番孵的小雞是例外的，而對於眼前準備起孵的蛋種，定然又勾起一股圓滿的美滿的希望·只是，據我所記得的，祖母這個希望又實在是從來沒有給她實現過的希望·這使得母親常常要背着她老人家半氣半笑的拿來做話柄·　　每年春二月初，母雞的蛋也下得特別多，這時祖母就要開始孵小雞了·給母雞上窩一定揀在臨夜上燈時分，蛋的　目也一定要用雙數，放蛋上窩的工作都是派定我擔任，說是這樣可以多孵大　雞，祖母就在旁邊擎着燈，口裏喃喃的而又極其莊重的不知唸些什麽，我就從一隻竹籃子裏把雞蛋一個一個移到做好的窩裏放好，然後再由嬸娘把母雞捉來輕輕放進去，又摯摯誠誠的吩咐母雞幾句勉勵話，這一節上窩禮纔算完成了·小雞孵出來後，漸漸壯健起來，常常會離開牠們的母親走到沒有掩蔽物的天階裏，東啄啄西跳跳；於是又漸漸的一隻一隻給老鷹從半空中閃然降下用兩隻鐵瓜攫了去充當糧食·到後來，祖母着了慌，纔把剩下的小鷄關在天井裏，一天到晚唧唧喳喳的呌着，也許因為缺少運動罷，祖母又吝惜白米，只把用水浸過的白飯拿給小鷄吃，疾病更容易染到了，不知怎麽一來，夜裏給蚊子在眼皮上刺了一口，過幾天小眼睛上就貼起隻大瘤子，母親看見了就要又氣又笑的說·　　—看，阿婆的小鷄，又打瞌睡了！引得大家一陣笑·這樣又過幾天下去，小鷄都完了，只剩下一隻母鷄還在東望望西張張，閣閣閣的呌着，尋覓它的小鷄·　　可是，祖母對於孵小鷄是不會因而灰心的，於是第二窩小鷄又孵出來了，而結果也就在同樣情形下只剩了一隻母鷄走來走去，東張西望，閣閣閣的呌着·　　今年，祖母已八十五歲，為了多病，身體是衰弱了許多了·但我想她老人家孵小鷄的熱心一定還是不减當年的·我雖不在家，自有弟弟們為她上窩·現在又是季春三月，她的小鷄早該孵出來的，讓我祝福她有一决完滿的收穫吧！讀「南遊十記」（上）  台生　　記得有人講過：「經過一次旅行，可以改變一個人的性情」，意思就是說，在旅行的旅程中，可以給你，許多人生經騐，因為在你的旅行中，最少你可以接觸社會各階級層的人物，甚致於你平常從來不肯和他們接談的人，常你走上孤單旅程的時候，他們都是你最親熱的伙伴·　　同時，在這個「非當」當的時期」中，我們如能够利用旅行，去觀察現社會的經濟，政治，以及一切在不景氣狂潮下現社會的面相，以及在帝國主義侵略下，各地商業貿易，政治，交通的情形，作一個有系統的調查，那麽所收穫到的，應當比讀十年書，還得寳貴十萬倍！　　最近讀了趙君豪　牛所著的，「南遊十記」，更感覺旅行給予我們重大的意義。播音特別節目　　　　月星社　　　音（一三四）下午四時至四時三刻　　春之花（秋虹）睡的雙美（秋霞）浣衣曲（張偉）大地行軍（施總）挑夫曲（偏雯）新夜來　（莉潔）休息五分鐘（璐玲）甜蜜的夢（夏斐）和平歌（王健）女軍人（全體）　　雛聲歌唱社　　（一三〇〇）下午六時至七時　　夜來香（瑋茜）三個小賣貝（莉玲）因為你太美（白朗）十里長亭十杯酒（露萍）睡的贊美（莉影）定情歌（蘋影）寄給父親的詩（李明）和平歌（淡琰）小天使（莉霞）梅花接老爺（蕊影）　　電霞藝術研究社平劇　　交部（一三〇〇）下午十時至十一時半九更天（湯起風）六月雪（金士鑫）南陽（汪徘祖）汾河灣（王錦堂）喜封候（王鴻志）盜宗卷（王坪石）坐宮（朱煥文）慶頂珠（鮑存明）南天門（陸兆元）（張兆熊）歌唱　　爵士歌劇社　　李樹德（九四〇）下午五時至五時三刻　　我當初認識你（露茜）寄給父親的詩（曼娜）我不能忘記你（金儀）自殺尙未成功（張俊）擱樓上的小姐（露茜）你路那一個抱（曼娜）我要你的一切（金儀）揚子江暴風雨（張俊）（二十八日）這回事情太希奇（露茜）謝謝你的口香糖（曼娜）敎我如何不想他（金儀）沉醉桃花美酒中（張俊）十里長亭十杯酒（露茜）爸爸倘若你愛我（曼娜）永別了我的弟弟（金儀）瑪麗若是你願意（張俊）　　風雲音樂歌唱社　　大中華（一一六〇）下午五時一刻至六時　　梅花接老爺（蕊英）慈母搖籃曲（張莉）我願意（馬太）睡的贊美（蕊）舟中曲（張莉）愛情如玫瑰（雪霞）　　（二十八日）飄泊者（許昆）好妹妹（張莉）特別快車（莉莉）鮮花新婚（蕊英）自殺尙未成功（雪霞）好時光（馬太）　　都會歌劇社　　李樹德（九四〇）下午五時三刻至六時半　　　天下太平歌　瀟湘夜夢　圓圓月　漂泊老　變料情人　湘累　　（二十八日）　航空救國　驚變　去年的我　新漁光曲　光明之路　鮮花新婚　　玲音社　　中西（一〇四〇）下午五時三刻至六時半　　燕帶春來（黃韻）安慰（黛萊）淸早起來（綠茵）雙料情人（黃韻）丁　當大太（金瑜）（綠茵）銀昏曲（黛萊）好朋友來了（全體）　　（二十八日）平湖春水（綠茵）特快車（黃韻）（黃韻）鮮花新婚（黛萊）銀漢雙星（瑜萊）　　曼蘿歌劇社　　麟記（一二二〇）下午九時三刻至十時半　　　漁　之歌　人間仙子　飛花歌　鐵蹄下的歌女　浣衣曲　我們的皇后　自殺尙未成功　　（二十八日）　路柳牆花　體育皇后　晚香　　玉　春之花　回憶　凱旋歌　安眠　　芙蓉團　　同樂（七二〇）下午十時三刻　　戀愛明星（雪露）鸞鳳引（雪雪）丈夫的ABC（文元）體育皇后（雪敏）小鵡哥（雪雪）（雪露）　　（二十八日）春之花（雪露）春霄膩舞曲（雪雪）晚香玉（文元）送郞（雪敏）浣衣曲（雪雪）　　海市電台（九〇〇）每日節目　　上午　　一一·四五　西樂　　一二·〇〇　報時　氣象　新聞　西樂　　下午　　四·四五　粵曲（滴滴淚，雨過天靑，午夜鈴，在飲，噤休，殘紅）　　五·〇〇　敎育節目（張泳春先生講：靑年學生應有之修養）　　五·三〇衛生運動　講（楊玉階先生）　　六·〇〇　市政報告（公用局吳思循先生講公用局整理本市廣告經過）　　六·三〇　氣象　新聞　歌唱（大路歌，開路先鋒，中華之光，旗正飄飄，神女搖船歌）　　七·〇〇　演講（上海巿商會）　　七·三〇　平劇（抗金兵·逍遙津·刺虎·大報國，宇宙風·武家坡·）　　八·〇〇　轉播中央廣播電台節目　　七·五〇　預報　日節目平劇明日節目　　毛執中美術講習座　　李樹德（九四〇）上午七時至八時半　　　小朋友的美術，因為現在是非常時期，環境太惡劣，只有美術能保存你們的天眞，　奏樂，　敎中西書譜中解剖及透視，　敎畫及覆畫件　　幼童播音團　　中西（一〇四〇）上午九時至十時　　慈愛的母親（錦寶）可愛的春天（朱斐）小小皮球（翠琴）從軍別母（芳恩）偉大的手（斯琪）可憐的秋香（琴珍）女軍人歌（王琳）萬里尋兄詞（耕娣）那一個抱（鳳娟）蝴蝶姑娘（合唱）　　藝鳴社　　同樂（七二〇）上午九時半至十時半　　嫁給勇士吧（藝瑾）睡的贊美（藝娜）船家曲（蓓霞）偉大的手（熱琳）定情歌（藝　）城市之光（藝瑾）民族魂（藝娜）回憶慈母曲（蓓霞）母親（藝琳）甜蜜的夢（藝蕙）　　玲玲歌音社　　友聯（八八〇）上午十時半至十一時半　　愛情是玫瑰（玲娜）太股平花（玲玲）鴛鴦怨（玲健）休息五分鐘（玲琍）小鸚哥（玲倩）回來吧（王瑾）（玲琍）燕雙飛（玲屛）夜深深（玲玲）永遠在後台（玲健）民族魂（周頡）空中音曰樂（玲健）（玲玲）義勇軍進行曲（全體）　　夜城藝社　　李樹德（九四〇）上午十一時至十二時　　回來吧（曼妮）我願意（王瑛）悲秋（孔芬）自由神（余芸）睡的贊美（曼琳）摩登戀愛（曼妮）城市之光（孫方）天倫（王瑛）救國進行（余芸）　　鮑明珊口琴敎授演奏　　安定（八六〇）下午三時至四時　　　敎授「正式口琴吹奏法」第六章第三節五度和音奏法及練習曲聖夜　敎授『普及口琴樂譜」第五種得意舞曲　演奏「中國口琴界」一卷二期賣花娘　演奏「正式口琴吹奏法」短音階分解和音梵亞鈴奏法荒城之月　　吼聲歌詠團　　鶴鳴（一四五〇）下午三時半至四時半　　開路先鋒（全體）頭頂中國大（周朋）漁光　（姜瑛）大地行軍曲（張晁）新大路（包痕）丐（興濤）和平歌（周娥）船夫曲（吼民）時勢英雄（包痕）（興濤）打長江（全體）　　稚鳴社　　交通（一三〇〇）下午五時至六時　　蘇三不要哭（氷卿）吹泡泡（沈玲）鴛鴦怨（沈瑛）銀漢雙星（柴瑟）愛的化（瑛瑛）塞外村女（斐君）秋夜簫聲（陳萍）悲秋（氷卿）恭賀新禧（沈玲）心上裂痕（沈瑛）　　夜鶯藝社　　上海（一一〇〇）下午八時至九時　　紅燒丈夫（曼娜）告別南洋（流朗）賣油條（露茜）打長江（柳村）人靜黃昏（琰琰）新漁光曲（曼娜）飄泊者（流朗）再見吧故鄉（露茜）揚子江暴風雨（柳村）漁村之歌（琰琰）　　餘音　　每星期六午後叫時，中西電台由漫畫家張義璋氏主持之「每週漫畫講　」·本期題為漫畫肖像　」·關於漫畫問題·均可函訽云·（蓮子）電影消息東北是我們的領土　我們為什麼不回槍　　實騐小劇場被迫停演後，內部工作，更形緊張，一方面正積極籌備第三决公演，一方面則由該劇場常年法律顧問史良律帥，直接與工部局交涉，據云、劇場非做到使走私二都會的　角」「秋陽」「劇能繼續演出，並保證嗣後演劇之絕對自由，决不罷休·、　　海燕劇社鑒於爭求民挨存亡最緊急的現在，對於努力國防戲劇」運動的建立，不遺餘力，近正忙於籌組流動演劇隊準備下鄕作喚起民衆統一救亡陣綫之呼號，曾於日前登求　劇隊隊員及社員，索章者幾百數十人，足見社會間對於該社的愛護和注意·日來正積極排　「回聲」「毒藥」「父子兄弟「活路等劇本·　　原該社為想迅速介紹新的劇作計，特於每星期四下午六時一刻至七吋，假座交通部電台播送話劇節目，以期挽回無綫電播音之晚近一般淫靡的頹風·上星期曾播　「走私」劇本，成精良好，日前（廿五日）該社原定播送田漢之新作「雪之夜」（發表於時代九卷十　期一該劇內容是以社會各階層生活的悽慘繪畫為主題，而以一二八滬戰暴發前夜為襯托，全劇並無過激或有犯×國邦交的描寫，祇臨終時「我們為什麽不回槍呢」等句、本經交部電台當局審查通過，但於臨時繼星期實騐小劇場與螞蟻劇團之後，被工部局勒令停播·致臨時改播「賣買」云。「新婚大血案」一幕　　金城映仲夏夜之夢　　大光明戲院，初定今日映梅蕙絲的「風塵奇女」，後因發生意想不到的　殊問題，改映世界鉅片「仲夏夜之夢」·該片雖曾一度獻映於國泰，但座價過於昂貴，今聞大光明開映此片時，並不加價，在仲夏之夜，看「仲夏夜之夢影片，誠趣事也。　　啟事　二十五日所刊「鄧波兒的新作」，署名「萊」，被漏植，特補正。</p>

<h3>Six University Presidents Telegraph the Central Government and Guangdong-Guangxi, Requesting Chen Li Bai to Draw Back from the Brink, Various Groups in Beijing Also Express Their Views</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After Chairman Chiang made a statement on the 25th regarding the policy of handling the current situation, on the 26th, six university presidents, including Luo Jialun of National Central University, telegraphed the Central Government, expressing admiration for the Central Government's policy of peaceful unification and requesting Chen Li Bai of Guangdong-Guangxi to draw back from the brink in order to maintain the life of the nation. The two telegrams are recorded as follows: To the Central Party Headquarters, Chairman Lin of the National Government, and President Chiang of the Executive Yuan: Upon reading President Chiang's speech on June 26th, which reiterated the Central Government's policy of peaceful unification and clearly indicated the principle of treating everyone equally and not pursuing past offenses, we are filled with admiration for your sincerity and openness. We earnestly request the Central Government to uphold this spirit of generosity, carefully consider the international environment, and make comprehensive plans to overcome the impending crisis. We anxiously await your instructions. Ren Hongjun, President of Sichuan University; Zhu Kezhen, President of Zhejiang University; Wang Xinggong, President of Wuhan University; Luo Jialun, President of National Central University; Hu Shuhua, President of Chongqing University; Zhang Linggao, President of West China Union University, respectfully submit. To Mr. Chen Bonan of Guangzhou, and Messrs. Li Delin and Bai Jiansheng of Nanning: Avoiding domestic warfare and preserving the vitality of the nation is the common desire of the people of the country today and the fundamental condition for resisting the enemy and saving the nation. Regardless of the reasons you hold, if you initiate warfare by advancing troops into neighboring provinces, then your move is precisely what the enemy country most desires. If this move is made, the entire game will be lost. This matter concerns the survival of the nation and is by no means just a matter of personal success or failure. The Central Government has already expressed its sincere and open intention not to allow the armies of the provinces defending themselves to cross into Guangdong and Guangxi. We earnestly request that you restrain your troops, withdraw to their original defenses, and await the Central Government's decision on a plan for resisting the enemy and proceed together. With heartfelt words, we dare to request that you draw back from the brink in order to maintain the life of the nation. Ren Hongjun, President of Sichuan University; Zhu Kezhen, President of Zhejiang University; Wang Xinggong, President of Wuhan University; Luo Jialun, President of National Central University; Hu Shuhua, President of Chongqing University; Zhang Linggao, President of West China Union University, respectfully submit. (June 26th, Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Various groups in Beijing have recently sent a telegram advising the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities to draw back from the brink. The original telegram states: (Titles omitted) Since the troops of Guangdong and Guangxi entered the borders of Hunan and Jiangxi, the entire country has been shocked. The Central Government and the people of various regions have repeatedly telegraphed advising you not to disrupt our plans foolishly and hasten our destruction. You have pretended to withdraw troops, but in reality, you have changed course and advanced north, invading the borders of Hunan and Jiangxi. It is now reported that you have organized a military committee, with you serving as the commander and deputy commander, respectively. The Guizhou army in Qiyang and Hengzhou, Hunan Province, has already begun attacking the garrison. The situation is urgent and even worse than before. Upon receiving this bad news, we want to cry but cannot. To save the country, we must unite and act in unison to succeed. Now, without waiting for the Central Government's orders, you have arbitrarily raised troops, disregarding party discipline and national laws. Furthermore, you have ignored the advice of the government and the people, disrupting the steps to defend against invasion and save the country, only to please the enemy and discourage the people. What are you seeking? We hope you will draw back from the brink, immediately withdraw all troops that have invaded the provinces of Jiangxi, Hunan, and Fujian back to the borders of Guangdong and Guangxi, and calmly await the resolution of the Second Plenary Session. The people of the country will certainly understand. If you persist in your errors, falsely claiming to resist Japan while seeking personal gain and intentionally undermining peaceful unification, then the blame for destroying peace will be on you. Success or failure, survival or demise, rests on this one move. We urge you to consider it. The Nanjing Municipal Farmers' Association, Workers' Welfare Committee, Chamber of Commerce, Women's Association, and various groups in Jiangning County have telegraphed the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities, stating that they will follow the Central Government's and the people's advice to immediately withdraw the troops invading the north and await the resolution of all major plans at the Second Plenary Session.

<p>(Changsha) Various Hunanese people's organizations believe that the Chen (of Guangdong) and Li Bai (of Guangxi) armies are continuing to advance north, contradicting their words and actions, causing extreme fear among the people of southern Hunan.

<p>(Xuzhou) The Tong Party Department and various groups have continuously telegraphed the Central Government, requesting sanctions against the military actions in the Southwest, stating that the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities are not acting as guardians of the country but are willingly becoming "beans boiled with their own stalks," and requesting effective sanctions to uphold discipline and comfort the people's expectations.

<h3>The Unfolding of the Japan-Australia Trade War</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>Since the Australian government announced a new tariff policy on May 22nd, raising import taxes on Japanese artificial silk and cotton fabrics imported into Australia, Japan also invoked the Trade Protection Act on the 25th of this month to restrict imports of Australian wool and wheat through an import permit system. This has not only caused the Japan-Australia trade conference, which began last year, to completely break down, but has also intensified the increasingly acute Japan-Australia trade war.</p>
<p>Australia is a part of the British Empire, an important destination for British capital and commodity exports. It is also a member of the Sterling Area, and the stability of its monetary system is closely related to the British pound. In recent years, it has been affected by the torrent of the global economic downturn, resulting in a gradual reduction in cash reserves in London and a financial deficit. The exchange rate of the Australian dollar in the London market is also likely to decline. In order to strengthen the ranks of the Sterling Area, it has adopted this new tariff policy to maintain the export market for British industrial products and stabilize the exchange rate of the Australian dollar in the London market. The greatest impact of the new tariff policy on Japan-Australia trade is the increase in tariffs on artificial silk and cotton fabrics. The new tariff rates stipulate a general tariff of nine pence per square yard for artificial silk fabrics, while British products are subject to a preferential tariff of only one and a half pence per square yard. For cotton textiles, the general tariff is a minimum of two and a quarter pence and a maximum of three and a half pence per square yard, while British products are also subject to a preferential tariff of half a penny per square yard or 5% ad valorem. After the implementation of this new tariff, it will obviously severely hit Japanese goods exported to Australia, making it impossible for them to compete with British goods enjoying preferential tariff treatment in the market.</p>
<p>Japan naturally wants to retaliate against such a blow. The only way to retaliate is to restrict the import of Australian wool and wheat. Wool and wheat are Australia's main products, and Japan is its major customer. Last year, Japan imported a total of 182 million yuan worth of wool and 30.9 million yuan worth of wheat from Australia. The former accounted for 9% of the total import value, and the latter accounted for 7.1%, both occupying a dominant position. Therefore, it believes that as long as it restricts the import of Australian wool and wheat, it can cause significant losses to Australia, forcing it to abandon the new tariff policy. In fact, this weapon is not a foolproof treasure. First of all, wool is not only necessary for the textile industry, but also indispensable in the military industry. Restricting wool imports will not only affect the expansion of the military industry but also reduce textile industry exports, which is tantamount to suicide in foreign trade. Although it can purchase wool from Argentina or South Africa to offset the restriction of Australian wool imports, the losses in freight and currency conversion will make its costs one-sixth higher than purchasing from Australia. Who will bear such huge losses? Moreover, Argentina and South Africa are also members of the Sterling Area. As for wheat, although it can also be purchased from wheat producers other than Australia, the United States and Argentina have had poor wheat harvests this year, and in fact, there may not be any surplus to supply to Japan. The only country that can supply Japan is Canada, but if Japan purchases from Canada, not only will the cost be 60 cents higher per 100 catties, but Canada is also a member of the Sterling Area. What effect will it actually have?</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, Australia's new tariff policy is driven by the United Kingdom, because the progress of the Japanese textile industry has made the United Kingdom feel an unprecedented threat to its hegemony in the Pacific. This is because when Mr. Ross left Japan, the Japanese press corps asked him in Yokohama whether, in addition to hoping to cooperate with Japan in investing in China, the United Kingdom would also allow Japan to trade in other countries. Mr. Ross's reply was that if Japan wants to obtain trade convenience in other countries, it is best to reflect first and not engage in fruitless competition. This is a very blunt indication that the United Kingdom is already prepared for a trade war with Japan. Currently, Japan's foreign trade is being obstructed everywhere. Not only is Australia doing this to it, but the United States and the Dutch East Indies are also raising tariffs on Japanese goods. This is naturally Japan's misfortune, but it will never remain silent. We believe that its strategy for responding to the challenge, in addition to strongly demanding an equal division of the world market, will be to intensify its efforts to monopolize the Chinese market. Therefore, the losses suffered by Japan in the trade war may also be shifted to us.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan held its 64th meeting on the morning of the 26th, with 61 members present, including Chen Changheng. President Sun Ke and Secretary-General Liang Hancao were absent due to illness, and Chen Haicheng, the secretary, stood in for them. The meeting discussed and resolved to amend and pass the "Provisional Regulations for Punishing the Smuggling of Customs Duties." It also resolved to add 314,562,869.24 yuan to both the national ordinary revenue and expenditure for the 23rd year's fourth supplementary budget, and resolved to add 1,868,455.70 yuan to both the national ordinary revenue and expenditure for the 24th year's second supplementary budget. The meeting also resolved to pass the total budget for ordinary local revenue and expenditure for Shandong Province in the 24th year, listing 27,945,987 yuan for both revenue and expenditure; the total budget for ordinary local revenue and expenditure for Chahar Province in the 24th year, listing 3,238,892 yuan for both revenue and expenditure; the total budget for ordinary local revenue and expenditure for Gansu Province in the 24th year, listing 5,033,436 yuan for both revenue and expenditure; and the supplementary total budget for ordinary local revenue and expenditure for Beijing Municipality in the 24th year, adding 100,000 yuan to both revenue and expenditure. The meeting resolved to pass the amendment to Appendix Two of the National Assembly Representative Election Law, which lists the counties under the jurisdiction of each electoral district in Hebei and Henan provinces. As for the national ordinary revenue and expenditure budget for the 25th year, President Sun has instructed the five committees to expedite the review and scheduled a temporary Yuan meeting for the morning of the 30th to deliberate on it so that it can be passed before the end of the year and submitted to the National Government for promulgation. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Appendix Two of the National Assembly Representative Election Law, previously passed by the Legislative Yuan, divides the counties under the jurisdiction of each electoral district in various provinces based on the reference materials originally sent by the Ministry of Interior. The names of the counties under the jurisdiction of each electoral district in Hebei and Henan provinces listed therein were also determined by the Ministry of Interior based on the exchange of county administrations between Hebei and Henan provinces, as well as the mergers and establishments of cities and counties in Henan Province. Now, because the administrative Yuan has approved the postponement of the exchange of counties and the establishment of cities and counties, amendments should be made to take into account the facts. The Legislative Yuan meeting on the 26th passed a resolution to change the counties under the jurisdiction of the 12th district of Hebei Province listed in Appendix Two of the National Assembly Representative Election Law to Daming, Nanle, Qingfeng, Cixian, Guangniu, Handan, Chengan, Changyuan, Puyang, and Dongming, with the number of representatives remaining at one.

Dozens of ronin forcefully loaded 684 pieces of artificial silk, sugar, cotton cloth, and cigarette paper onto three third-class cars, numbers 1053, 1114, 1122, and 1137, and a second-class car. Due to the excessive load, the springs of the second-class car were damaged. Station personnel detached the car, and the train departed from the East Station at 12:00 PM. At the main station, the engineering department discovered that the three third-class cars were also in a dangerous condition. They negotiated with the ronin to unload some of the goods, but were refused. After much delay, Japanese military police were invited to supervise the removal of the three third-class cars. It was agreed that the goods would be transported the next day. The delay lasted two hours, and the train finally departed south at 1:30 AM on the 26th. Because four cars were detached, passengers boarding in Pingjin could not board the train. 294 people had their tickets refunded and changed to the 75 slow train heading south on the morning of the 26th. Some passengers had to spend the night at the station while waiting for the train. (Special dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Following the dispute at the Tianjin Main Station on the 25th night, smuggled goods were still being transferred by railway and attached to the 75th train at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 26th, heading south. In the evening, ronin from the Trade Association again used trucks to transport hundreds of pieces of sugar and artificial silk to the Tianjin East Station, piling them up on the platform, waiting for night trains to transport them. Two new arms dealers have recently opened in a certain concession in Tianjin, which was unprecedented. They sell firearms smuggled from the Northeast Ordnance Factory, but buyers must prove that they are not anti-Japanese. Ainsworth flew south to Beijing on the afternoon of the 26th with his entourage. It has not yet been decided whether the General Inspectorate of Customs will be established in Pukou. Discussions will be held after Ainsworth returns. Five branches have been established on the Pinghan Railway in Zhengzhou, Xinxiang, Xuchang, Hankou, and Shijiazhuang, with Li Pengshou serving as the director of anti-smuggling. Li Tonghua serves as the director on the Tianjin-Pukou Line. (Special dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bureau has instructed the police and transportation departments to cooperate with the anti-smuggling branches to strictly crack down on smuggling. The entire line is divided into four sections: from Pukou to Xuzhou, from Xuzhou to Tai'an, from Tai'an to Dezhou, and from Dezhou to Tianjin. Railway staff and police are all responsible for close cooperation. (Special dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the morning of the 26th, ronin transported 450 pieces of smuggled sugar and artificial silk onto the 21st passenger train heading south on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. The train had a total of four passenger cars, all of which were filled. Passengers were lying on top of the goods, unable to move. Railway officials' attempts to dissuade them were ineffective. One of the passenger cars had its axle broken due to the pressure and was left at the main station. The ronin protested and refused to comply. After much negotiation, they were allowed to follow the car south on this train, and the situation was calmed. The train departed south at 10:15 AM, with a delay of over an hour. (Special dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Smuggling ronin are dumping goods at low prices in Tianjin due to high costs and losses, resulting in mutual competition. They are now making every effort to sell off the goods, while goods from eastern Hebei are stagnant. (Special dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<h3>Smuggled Goods Seized in Qingdao; Japanese Surround Customs</h3>
<p>(Qingdao) The Japanese ship "Maoyi Maru" was found to be carrying smuggled goods and was seized by Qingdao Customs. On the afternoon of the 26th, Japanese residents held a general meeting and claimed that customs officers had beaten and insulted the crew members. They decided to lodge a serious protest with the customs authorities. In the evening, some Japanese people surrounded the customs office for a time, but then dispersed. Several hundred people went to commit assault. The Public Security Bureau notified the Japanese consulate to send police to the scene to maintain order, and the American consul also went to the scene to investigate.

<h3>Reason for the Insult of Foreigners During the Japanese Military Flag Presentation Ceremony in Beiping; Japanese Will Reply to the American and French Embassies, Saying the Japanese Flag Is Sacred and Inviolable</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese military attaché Imai announced that the Japanese authorities will reply to the inquiries made by the American and French embassies within a few days regarding the impolite treatment of three American and French residents who were onlookers during the Japanese military regiment flag presentation ceremony on Tuesday. It is claimed that foreigners must know that the Japanese flag has a special importance and is sacred and inviolable. Japanese soldiers have the utmost respect for it. Therefore, "wherever the Japanese flag goes, Japanese soldiers will fight to the death to follow it." He believes that this incident was caused by the excessive attention of the Japanese soldiers in protecting the flag. He does not believe that the audience was threatened by bayonets. In the future, Japanese soldiers will pay special attention to prevent the recurrence of such incidents. (Reuters dispatch from the 26th)</p>

<h3>Military Attaché Imai Talks; Tashiro Will Go to Beiping at the Beginning of the Month</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese military attaché Imai said that the recent transfer of Japanese troops back and forth may be due to something happening or to routine drills, and does not represent an increase in troops.

<h3>Sasaki Case; British Consulate Reopens Trial</h3>
<p>(Beiping) British Consul Fitzmaurice reopened the trial this morning in the case of the British soldier accused of beating to death Japanese officer Sasaki. First, a Korean waitress from a certain sake shop testified that she was sitting with four Korean customers in the sake shop around midnight on the 26th when two British soldiers suddenly entered. One of them inexplicably punched two of the customers. One of them dropped the glass he was holding and bent down to pick it up, and was kicked off the chair by the other British soldier. The two then ran out. The magistrate ordered her to identify the two soldiers, and the woman pointed to Hunter and another British soldier, Vilston, who was in court, and said that Vilston had kicked her several times, causing her to fall to the ground and injure herself, and she had been bedridden for several days. She also said that Vilston was the one who beat the Korean man. (The initial accusation was that Hunter had struck.) After being questioned by the lawyer, the woman replied that these things happened on Sunday. She knew the two soldiers, but had never seen them together before. Then a rickshaw puller testified that he was walking along Hada Men Street at midnight on May 26 when he saw two soldiers coming out of Suzhou Hutong. He also saw two Japanese men. One of the soldiers suddenly turned around and punched him several times and kicked his leg. He fell to the ground unconscious. He woke up half an hour later and saw a Japanese man lying on the side of the road, and another Japanese man hired a rickshaw to take him away. He did not know how the Japanese man fell to the ground. He could not recognize the soldiers who beat him that day. In the afternoon, the court reopened and summoned three Chinese witnesses, all of whom claimed to have been beaten by two foreign soldiers on the night of May 26. One was a hotel waiter, one was a rickshaw puller, and one was a peddler. The rickshaw puller and the peddler both said that the perpetrators looked like British soldiers and wore armbands. They had removed the armbands and put them in their pockets before committing the assault. However, none of the three could identify the perpetrators among the British soldiers standing in court.

<h3>US Democratic Party Passes Platform: Advocates for Constitutional Amendments, Strives to Avoid Involvement in the Vortex of War, Undertakes Three Obligations to the People</h3>
<p>Philadelphia - The Democratic National Convention today passed its party platform declaration. Drafting member and New York State Senator Robert stated that this platform is the Democratic Party's greatest contribution to the nation. The declaration proclaimed that the government in this new era has the following three obligations to its citizens: 1. Protection of the family; 2. Creation of opportunities for democracy; 3. Assistance to the victims of hardship.</p>
<p>Regarding foreign policy, it advocates for: Continuing President Roosevelt's Good Neighbor Policy; Reaffirming the goals of the Kellogg-Briand Pact; Maintaining neutrality in conflicts between other countries; Exercising caution to prevent involvement in any war through international banking affairs or private trade. On foreign trade, it supports the reciprocal trade agreements established by Secretary of State Hull. It declares its continued protection of farmers and industries to prevent dumping.</p>
<p>The declaration also stated, "We are determined to reduce government expenditures, balance the budget, and reduce the national debt as quickly as possible." As for monetary policy, it proclaimed, "We support a permanent and sound currency, stabilizing its value to prevent the great fluctuations of past currency values." However, it did not mention the silver issue or war debts. Regarding the Constitution, it stated, "New Deal implementation has proven that when state and federal legislatures cannot adequately address issues such as droughts and floods, minimum wages, maximum working hours, the working conditions of child labor in industry, monopolistic and unfair business practices, in accordance with the Constitution, clear amendments must be sought."</p>
<p>This party platform was passed by the assembly without debate and was communicated to President Roosevelt by telephone. After his approval, it was immediately released. (Reuter, 25th)</p>
<p>US Democratic Party Convention</p>
<p>Philadelphia - The Democratic National Convention convened this afternoon for only thirty-two minutes, adjourning at 12:47 PM to reconvene tonight at 8:00 PM. During the session, the entire delegation unanimously elected Senator Robinson as the official chairman. At the same time, the Rules Committee, by a vote of thirty-six to thirteen, passed a recommendation to the convention to abolish the longest-standing traditional rule of the party, namely, that the presidential and vice-presidential candidates' eligibility for election required a two-thirds majority vote, changing it to a simple majority. As for the platform issue, it is understood that on the patent system, all parties have agreed to take a strict stance. The issues of wages and working hours are also expected to reach a compromise. The only point of contention in tonight's convention is likely to be the modification of the presidential candidate's eligibility criteria. Representatives from the southern states still want to retain this old rule with a history of one hundred and four years. (National News Agency, 25th)</p>
<p>Philadelphia - After an all-night meeting of the Rules Committee of the Democratic National Convention, the convention today decided by a vote of thirty-six to twelve to abolish the rule requiring a two-thirds majority to elect presidential candidates. However, to appease the opposition, the convention is preparing to advocate for the reapportionment of delegates to future conventions. The platform committee also adjourned at dawn today after an all-night discussion of the party's election procedures. All members have agreed to keep their efforts secret until President Roosevelt approves them. It is reported that the convention's greatest hesitation regarding the platform is over the wage and working hour clause. Party leaders are willing to issue a statement to satisfy liberals and labor without specifically stating that the party must engage in a constitutional amendment movement to allow the federal government or state governments to rigorously implement laws regulating minimum working hours and minimum wages. Republican presidential candidate Landon has already declared his support for a constitutional amendment granting states the power to enact such laws. (Reuter, 25th)</p>
<p>Philadelphia - During tonight's session of the National Democratic Convention, supporters of President Roosevelt and supporters of "Old Al" Smith engaged in a fierce fistfight, causing a great uproar among the audience. Police were summoned to restore order and the Smith faction was expelled from the venue. (Reuter, 25th)</p>
<p>Philadelphia - The Democratic National Convention has just passed the platform proposed by the Resolutions Committee. A small group of demonstrators, holding banners with the words "We Support Smith," broke into the venue, resulting in a minor conflict. Twelve demonstrators were quickly arrested. Smith is the former Governor of New York and competed fiercely with President Roosevelt in the last Democratic National Convention election of presidential candidates (1932), ultimately failing. He later defected from the Democratic Party due to his opposition to Roosevelt's "New Deal." (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The White House stated today that President Roosevelt's speech accepting the Democratic Party's renomination for president this Saturday will be short and concise, the opposite of lengthy orations at the convention. It is understood that the entire speech will be less than two thousand words, beginning with accepting the party's nomination, then explaining the rationality of the current government's various actions, and providing a brief outline of his future policies. (National News Agency, 25th)</p>
<p>Philadelphia - While the Democratic Party Platform Committee was discussing foreign policy, Senator Lewis suddenly attended and spoke out against Philippine independence. He stated, "The United States should quickly correct its error of allowing the Philippines to become independent. I advocate placing the Philippines under the American flag. If we sever our relationship with the Philippines, Japan will surely seize the islands." (National News Agency, 25th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Senator Norris, who has repeatedly refused to support his Republican Party, criticized Republican presidential candidate Landon after dining with President Roosevelt at the White House today. He strongly criticized the Republican Party's competitive platform, expressing dissatisfaction with entrusting the management of working hours and wages to state governments. Norris supported Smith in 1928 and President Roosevelt in 1932. He stated today that he would travel extensively during this year's general election to continuously support the president. Norris is the first progressive to support President Roosevelt. Speculation abounds here as to whether others among the progressives will follow Norris' example. Senator Borah recently failed in his attempt to participate in the Republican campaign and is deeply dissatisfied with the party's insistence on conservative currency policies. Therefore, many believe that he may also leave the Republican Party. (National News Agency, 25th)</p>
<p>US Democratic Party Platform</p>
<p>Philadelphia - The Democratic Party Convention today decided on its campaign platform, advocating for the maintenance of a sound currency in the shortest possible time, balancing the national budget, and amending the Constitution as necessary to achieve social security. At the same time, the rule requiring a two-thirds majority for presidential candidates was also abolished. Hereafter, a simple majority will be considered legal, but the current session must still follow the two-thirds majority rule. (National News Agency, 25th)</p>
<p>Philadelphia - The Democratic Party Convention's approved platform, two thousand words long, has the following key points:</p>
<p>Continue to use the power of the federal government to oppose the exploitation and bullying of ordinary people by large capitalists.</p>
<p>Expand the social security program.</p>
<p>Enable consumers and producers to obtain reasonable prices.</p>
<p>Continue building power generation projects.</p>
<p>Expand the federal government's housing construction movement.</p>
<p>Provide fair treatment to veterans and their families.</p>
<p>Continue to promote the government's agricultural bill.</p>
<p>Protect collective contracts and extend the federal government's arbitration of labor-management disputes.</p>
<p>Eliminate mutually destructive commercial competition.</p>
<p>Assist young people.</p>
<p>Use the power of the federal government to eliminate various industrial and commercial monopolies.</p>
<p>Relieve victims of natural disasters.</p>
<p>Build public works to relieve unemployment.</p>
<p>If social security programs cannot be completed under the current legal system, the Constitution may be amended.</p>
<p>Civil servants adopt a ranking system.</p>
<p>Freedom of speech, newspapers, no tariffs, broadcasting, religious belief, and mass unions are all guaranteed.</p>
<p>Establish a sound currency.</p>
<p>Economize on national expenditures and balance the budget.</p>
<p>Continue the policy of reciprocal trade and good neighborliness with foreign countries.</p>
<p>Restrict the import of cheap labor to maintain the livelihood of agriculture. (National News Agency, 25th)</p>
<p>Montreux Conference - Acknowledges Turkey's demands. As soon as the new convention is signed, the Straits can be remilitarized. Montreux - The Dardanelles Straits Conference has tentatively decided that as soon as the new convention is signed, Turkey will be allowed to re-establish military defenses in the Straits. General discussions have concluded. Today, the conference officially announced its adjournment until after the League of Nations Executive Council and the General Assembly convene, at which point it will reconvene. After the new convention is signed, a special protocol will allow Turkey to immediately re-establish military defenses in the Straits. Not only that, but Turkey will also be allowed to immediately implement Article 9 of the convention, which stipulates that if Turkey considers any warship passing through the Straits to pose a risk of war, it may take special measures to control it. Today, British representative Stanhope suggested abolishing the clause prohibiting aircraft from flying over the Straits. That clause has been referred to the technical committee for review. While the main representatives remain in Geneva, the committee will continue to discuss everything. The conference's progress seems slow and difficult. To date, only the first sentence of Article 2 of the Straits Convention has been discussed, and a universally acceptable solution has yet to be found. (Reuter, 25th)</p>
<p>Montreux - The Montreux Conference announced its adjournment this morning until after the League of Nations Council and Assembly have concluded. Political figures believe that the British government is currently acting to slow down the conference's work in order to wait for the lifting of sanctions and Italy's appearance before proceeding with deliberations. This shows that the United Kingdom and Italy seem to have reached an agreement on the Straits issue beforehand. At this moment, the United Kingdom wants to use the Straits issue to conduct talks with Italy, and then seek mutual rapprochement through this path. However, although the Montreux Conference has hastily come to a stage, one cannot immediately conclude that the conference's work has made progress. In fact, the various difficulties encountered by the conference have not been resolved, but only temporarily set aside for later discussion. As for the sudden adjournment of the conference, there are three main reasons: 1. If the conference were to continue at this time, the divergent opinions of the various countries would be fully exposed. Such an impression should be avoided so that the countries have sufficient time to diplomatically eliminate the difficulties. 2. The League of Nations Council and Assembly will convene one after another in the coming days, and the chief representatives of the various countries must go to participate. 3. Since Italy has not sent representatives to attend the Montreux Conference, the various countries are not in a position to directly adopt a definite and irreversible resolution. Judging from today's conference, it can be seen that the United Kingdom and Japan are unwilling to take any binding action on certain key points of the future convention before Italy comes forward to support them. Italy is currently adopting a reserved attitude on this matter, just like the United Kingdom and Japan. In short, the Montreux Conference will temporarily lower its flags and cease its drums in the coming days to await the important meetings held in Geneva. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<h3>French Interior Minister Declares "Social Revolution" Successful: Military Industries to be Nationalized</h3>
<p>(Paris) Interior Minister Salengro recently declared in the Chamber of Deputies that the number of striking workers nationwide had been reduced from 1,150,000 to 29,000. "This is an unprecedentedly great social movement in French history, and it has ended without bloodshed." Many deputies applauded and praised these words. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today's Public Gazette contains the following important labor laws: 1. Regulations for paid annual leave for employees in various professions, businesses, and households; 2. Regulations for general collective contracts; 3. Regulations for a 40-hour workweek for industrial and commercial employees, and a 38-hour and 40-minute workweek for underground miners. (Reuter, 26th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Cabinet is scheduled to submit a draft law to the Chamber of Deputies today, advocating for the nationalization of military industries, either in whole or in part, with the state purchasing shares at the average price of the past seven years. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Before departing for Geneva today, Foreign Minister Delbos attended the Senate. Several senators questioned the government's published declaration on foreign policy. The Foreign Minister replied, "While we hold the aspiration for peace, we must also dedicate ourselves to strengthening national defense, ensuring that our country's military equipment maintains sufficient strength to adapt to the needs of the situation." (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, after debating foreign policy, the Senate passed a vote of confidence in the government with 185 votes to 58. Foreign Minister Delbos declared to the Senate, "We are now expressing goodwill to Germany again, hoping that the situation will be conducive to Franco-German coordination." Generally speaking, the speeches given by Blum and Delbos today were largely the same as those announced to the Chamber of Deputies on Thursday. The Council of Ministers today passed a decree to double the salaries of the army and navy and approved the draft law on industrial nationalization during times of emergency.

<h3>Another Dispute Between Japan and Russia: Aircraft Crosses Border and Border Guards Exchange Fire</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Ambassador Ueda's report to the Foreign Ministry on the 5th, on June 6th and 14th, Japanese soldiers patrolling in the territory of "Manchukuo" were twice fired upon by Soviet soldiers. On the morning of June 6th at 6:30 AM, Japanese soldiers patrolling the territory of "Manchukuo" two meters southeast of Gaoyancun were suddenly fired upon by Soviet soldiers with rifles.

<p>Keijo - The Korean Army Command announced that on June 24th at 1:00 PM, a Soviet aircraft crossed the border from the direction of Siroze, flying into Manchukuo to scout Hunchun at an altitude of 600 meters. At 1:15 PM, it entered Changlingzi. It is unprecedented for Russian aircraft to fly at such a low altitude for reconnaissance purposes. The Japanese Army will lodge a serious protest with the Soviet Union. (Domei News Agency, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a report received by the Foreign Ministry from Ambassador Ueda stationed in Manchuria on the 25th, Japanese soldiers patrolling within the territory of "Manchukuo" were fired upon by Russian soldiers on June 6th and 14th. These incidents occurred at locations southeast of Gaoyancun and in Dashimashegou Village. The Japanese side has decided to lodge a protest with Russia.</p>
<h3>Italo-German Aviation Agreement Signed</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The semi-official German News Agency recently announced that Italian Air Force Minister and Air Force Chief of Staff General Valle has reached Berlin and concluded a commercial aviation agreement with German authorities, with a term of ten years. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Executive Council Meets: UK and France Claim Agreement Reached; Frequent Contacts Between Representatives Outside the Meeting; Ethiopian Emperor Arrives in Geneva to Make Final Appeal</h3>
<p>(Paris) British Foreign Secretary Eden flew into this city around 5:36 PM. He held a private talk with Prime Minister Léon Blum and Foreign Minister Delbos at the British Embassy that lasted for a considerable time, ending only when Eden and Delbos boarded their car for Geneva. A public statement issued afterward stated that the result of the three-person talk was satisfactory, with agreement reached on the main issues to be resolved at the League of Nations Executive Council meeting. It is reported that the main issue discussed by the three was the Italian annexation of Abyssinia. In addition, Léon Blum and Delbos also mentioned the diplomatic consequences of German troops' entry into the Rhineland. The German government has not yet responded to the British inquiries on this issue, and it remains to be resolved. Around 11:00 PM, the talk ended. Delbos then left for Lyon Station at 11:30 PM, accompanied by Political Assistant to the Foreign Ministry Marsigli and Legal Advisor to the Foreign Ministry Padewan, boarding a train for Geneva. British Foreign Secretary Eden, along with the Ethiopian Emperor and his entourage, also departed on the same train. The Ethiopian Emperor arrived here at 8:58 PM this evening and, after a few hours' stay, boarded the train to leave. Before departing, he told our reporter that he had important matters to handle in Geneva and had to leave on schedule, which he regretted. At that time, there were few people at the station, no more than forty, including the police. This was clearly different from the warm welcome he received from the people when he recently arrived in the British capital. After the Emperor boarded the train, Foreign Minister Delbos immediately paid his respects on behalf of the French government. General Gaza, the former Commander of the Northern Route of Ethiopia, and several attendants also departed on the same train. The Emperor himself looked dejected and very tired. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) British Foreign Secretary Eden recently left Paris after holding talks with French Prime Minister Léon Blum and Foreign Minister Delbos. People in both the United Kingdom and France are very satisfied with the progress of these talks. British sources have also stated that these talks are not limited to the issues to be discussed by the League of Nations, but also on the issue of maintaining the League of Nations Covenant and enriching the collective security mechanism, the two sides seem to have reached a consensus.

<p>(London) After Army Minister Duff Cooper gave a speech at the Anglo-French Association in Paris yesterday, the Daily Express diplomatic correspondent recently stated, "This speech was approved by the cabinet and is intended to cultivate British public opinion.

<p>(London) The Ethiopian Emperor invited Foreign Secretary Eden to meet on Tuesday this week. Regarding this matter, the Ethiopian Embassy in the United Kingdom recently issued a public statement stating, "The Ethiopian Emperor and Foreign Secretary Eden met for an hour on that day. During the talks, Eden assured the Emperor that the United Kingdom would continue to abide by the League of Nations Covenant and would not recognize the Italian annexation of Abyssinia. The old Empire of Ethiopia will continue to be recognized. The Ethiopian Emperor immediately stated that he was deeply disappointed by the British Cabinet's decision to withdraw sanctions and intended to lodge a strong protest with the League of Nations, resolutely opposing the withdrawal of sanctions. He also stated that all member states of the League of Nations, regardless of size or strength, have the right to enjoy security. This right, and the peace of the world, is guaranteed solely by the League of Nations Covenant. Therefore, he will request the League of Nations to implement the various measures stipulated in the Covenant." According to our reporter's investigation, Foreign Secretary Eden's assurances were only based on the position that the League of Nations General Assembly will take on this issue at the end of this month and cannot be bound by future developments. As for the continued recognition of the old Empire of Abyssinia, Eden's promise is also insufficient to bind British future policies. This is inconsistent with the wording in the public statement of the Ethiopian Embassy. (Havas, 25th)</p>

<p>Letter from the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau</p>
<p>To the Editor of Shen Bao:</p>
<p>We are writing in response to a special dispatch on the 24th of this month, published in your esteemed newspaper on the 25th, regarding the incident at our Jiangbian Iron Factory involving a trainee named Jianwu, who caused a major accident by privately experimenting with a generator. After investigation, we found that the facts were inconsistent with the report. We hereby provide a detailed account of the incident:</p>
<p>The deceased, Jianwu, was from Jiangxi and in his early twenties. He previously studied at a Jiangxi vocational school but dropped out midway due to personal reasons. He then joined our factory as a trainee. He was diligent in his studies and keen on researching science, hoping to make inventions and contribute to society. This spring, he suddenly submitted a report to the Zhejiang Provincial Government, the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Industry, and our bureau, claiming to have invented a generator that could be manufactured using simple methods. His method was based on the Thermo Conpe principle, using a large iron pot buried upside down in the ground, with coal burned inside. Iron pipes were connected to supply air, generating heat exceeding 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit. Two metal wires were passed through the furnace to generate electricity and create a generator. At that time, our bureau, after reviewing the explanation and conducting an examination, determined that this method was an unrealistic fantasy. Firstly, the current generated by this method would be extremely low, insufficient for powering a generator. Secondly, supplying air into the pot would easily cause gasification. Thirdly, according to the principle, the two metal wires would require the use of extremely expensive metals such as platinum, but he used copper wires, which were unlikely to produce good results. Fourthly, the temperature and pressure inside the pot would be too high, creating a dangerous situation. Experts in electrical engineering and chemistry from our bureau repeatedly advised him not to attempt the experiment lightly, to avoid accidents. Our bureau also issued an order prohibiting him from conducting the experiment. However, Jianwu refused to believe this and was convinced of his success. On the afternoon of yesterday, he invited two workers, Wu and Chen, to the sandy ground next to the factory to conduct his first experiment. As a result, the pressure inside the pot became too high, and the underground pot exploded violently. Jianwu, being the person in charge, was the most severely injured and died after being taken to Guangji Hospital. Workers Wu and Chen were further away and were fortunate not to be fatally injured, although they were seriously wounded. Our bureau has notified the family of the deceased to come to Hangzhou for the funeral arrangements. The two injured workers are receiving treatment in the hospital and are not in critical condition. The above is the factual account of the incident. We kindly request that your esteemed newspaper publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" section to correct the record.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Japanese Immigration to Eastern Heilongjiang: Large-Scale Operation Underway</p>
<p>Six Immigration Waves Scheduled for This Year and Next Year</p>
<p>Advance Team to Arrange Everything in Advance</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Concerning the implementation of the Ministry of Colonial Affairs' Fifth Immigration Plan, a vanguard team of sixty students from Harbin National Higher School, led by Japanese nationals Mizumura, Yada, and Aoki, will enter the Yong'an Tun, Chaoyang Tun, and Heitai Zi areas within Mishan County in late June.</p>
<p>Another advance team of 150 people will be dispatched from Japan to immigrate in mid-September. Furthermore, in March of the following year,</p>
<p>before the main force arrives, houses will be built, farmland and agricultural tools will be purchased, vegetables will be planted, fuel will be prepared, plans for the first year of settlement will be established, and livestock will be purchased to prepare for everything. Only after the fourth wave can the experimental immigration phase be abandoned and formal large-scale immigration begin. From this point onward, preparations will be handled by various departments, with clearly defined responsibilities, to strengthen the preparation effort for the large-scale immigration to come. The preparation methods are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Establish a Reclamation Affairs Office in Mishan County, with the puppet county magistrate serving as the director, and staff members as officers. The Reclamation Bureau will also send additional personnel, and the puppet Industry Department's Agricultural Affairs Section will also dispatch staff. Moreover, resident staff from the Manchurian Development Corporation will also be stationed at the office to jointly prepare all affairs.</p>
<p>(2) The preparation for construction will be led by the Reclamation Affairs Office, responsible for guiding and integrating the original residents with the immigrants, as well as preparing the settlement areas for immigration. The Manchurian Development Corporation will manage and adjust the basic data for the settlement construction plan, as well as facilitate the construction of roads and the demarcation of villages, and provide construction funds. The Agricultural Affairs Section will be responsible for selecting and guiding the cultivation of crops based on Japanese agricultural policy. As for the fifth immigration site within Mishan County, it is the Yong'an Tun, Chaoyang Tun, and Heitai Zi areas, with a cultivated area of 20,000 cho, a fertile black soil area. The security situation in the surrounding area is not very good. However, the number of immigrant households will be twice that of the fourth wave, totaling 1,000 households or 1,000 people (including family members). Before the implementation of the immigration, the Reclamation Bureau will prepare everything in coordination with the Manchurian Development Corporation, considering it a joint effort. Local industry has already been handled. Therefore, regarding the sixth immigration, given the current situation in the area and the enthusiasm for immigration to Northeast China within Japan, large-scale immigration will certainly be achievable. Thus, the original target of 3,000 households for the next year's immigration has been revised to 6,000 households. The Reclamation Bureau, following this policy of the Ministry of Colonial Affairs, has also begun selecting settlement sites with the goal of 6,000 households, and is carrying out preparation work.</p>
<p>Recruiting Chinese Laborers in Putian, Across the Strait</p>
<p>Daily Military Training</p>
<p>To be Used as Guides</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: According to the Quanzhou-Xiamen News, "In the fourth district of Putian County, located in a coastal area, someone went to the coast three months ago under the guise of recruiting miners. They verbally agreed to a monthly wage of twenty-six yuan and five jiao per person, with six yuan paid upfront as a settlement fee. Many ignorant people, driven by poverty, applied. From March to the end of April, a total of 4,700 people were recruited. Recently, some who had secretly returned from across the strait reported that they were being monitored upon arrival and had very limited freedom of movement. Communication was strictly prohibited, and their work was not mining but daily lessons and military training. Each person had the characters "中國" [China] tattooed on both cheeks. It is rumored that after four months, they will be assigned to units, four people per company, to serve as guides. Schools in the area have suspended classes for two months to conduct military training," etc. The so-called "across the strait" probably refers to Taiwan. (June 21st)</p>
<p>Guangdong Province Prepares Two Major Water Conservancy Projects</p>
<p>Total Construction Cost of Over Three Million Yuan</p>
<p>To be Advanced by the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Guangdong River Management Committee, to develop water conservancy in the province, previously planned to block the Jiang River and dredge the rear channel of the Pearl River. After drafting a detailed plan, it submitted a request to the National Government to advance funds for implementation. Upon receiving the report, the National Government forwarded the entire case to the National Economic Council for review and approval. The council then sent water conservancy experts Pu Lide and technician Tan Baotai to inspect the area. After arriving in Guangdong and conducting a survey, Pu and Tan returned north to report. They deemed both water conservancy projects feasible. The signed report has been submitted to the National Government for review. It is heard that the National Government plans to approve the required funds to be transferred to the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund Trustees for disbursement to facilitate construction. Upon receiving the news, the River Management Committee telegraphed Luo Yiqun, the committee's resident representative in Nanjing, to discuss everything with the National Government nearby to expedite progress. The two water conservancy projects are quite large, requiring a total of more than 3.8 million yuan. Furthermore, the Provincial Water Conservancy Committee previously decided to build the Trigonal Delta Base, and the survey of the sandbar area has been completed, allowing for construction to begin. However, due to the upcoming autumn harvest, fearing that it would affect the crops, implementation has been postponed.</p>
<p>Songjiang: Fierce Criminals Transferred to Shanghai Prison</p>
<p>After Su Xiao, the former warden of this county's prison, implemented reforms and eliminated "cell bosses," the prison was praised for a time. However, as time passed, old habits resurfaced, and "cell bosses" gradually returned. The responsible authorities did not intervene, and new inmates suffered oppression and extortion, becoming tools for collecting money. At the last meeting of the Prison Reform Association, it was discussed how to improve prisons, starting with separating the notoriously violent "cell bosses." A resolution was passed to select the worst offenders and transfer them to Caohjing Prison, and the Higher Court approved. On the 26th, County Magistrate Li personally led security teams, public security bureau detectives, and police officers to the prison at 9:00 AM to extract Wu Qinghe, Yu Yunsheng, Fan San, Le Xiugen, Li Qingyun, Shen Yuda, Wang Fusheng, Gu Amao, Yang Chonglang, Zhong Shaoyun, Xia Ayun, and 17 others. A large truck was hired, and they were escorted by armed guards to Shanghai for imprisonment.</p>
<p>Kunshan: Telegram Requesting Thorough Investigation of Interest Income</p>
<p>The county party headquarters, county council, and various public organizations have not yet been allocated the interest income from the temporary deposit accounts for county tax funds, and they recently jointly telegraphed the Jiangsu Supervisory Commissioner, requesting a confidential investigation. It is learned that Li Weiruo and eight other natives of this county in Nanjing also sent a telegram on the 24th requesting a thorough investigation. The original text is as follows: "Jiangsu Supervisory Commissioner Ding Goujian: In the case of the interest income from the temporary deposit accounts for Kunshan County tax funds, County Magistrate Peng's response to the Fund Management Office is evasive, clearly indicating collusion. Local public legal organizations have already telegraphed requesting a confidential investigation. Compatriots in Nanjing are extremely indignant. We hereby send a telegram requesting that you, sir, conduct a thorough investigation in public to purify officialdom and deter corruption. Deepest gratitude."</p>
<p>Suzhou: Signing a Public Agreement to Prevent Smuggling</p>
<p>The Wu County Chamber of Commerce, in order to prevent smuggled goods from being dumped in Suzhou, convened a general meeting of industry representatives on the 25th and resolved to organize a Smuggling Prevention Committee by the Chamber of Commerce. It is learned that the Smuggling Prevention Committee will consist of five members, selected from representatives of the Chinese and foreign general merchandise, transportation, and paper industries. Each industry will also sign a public agreement to be followed consistently by all members to achieve practical results. The specific measures are being drafted by the County Chamber of Commerce. It is also learned that there have been many smuggled goods recently in Suzhou, mainly toys and medicines, which are distributed by foreign drug stores to various peddlers for sale. The authorities are paying close attention to this.</p>
<p>Wuxi: The Heinous Assassination Case at Beizhakou</p>
<p>The Fan Hongyu Rong Silk Cloth and Foreign Goods Store at No. 102 Beizhakou in this county was opened by Fan Juquan (81 years old). Fan's wife, Xu (66 years old), had two sons and one daughter. The elder son was named Rongbo, the younger son Shulin, and the daughter Suzhen (33 years old) was still unmarried. Shulin had no children. Only Rongbo's wife, Zhou, had given birth to seven sons, but most died young, leaving only one son, Hangen, 16 years old, who assisted with accounting in the store. He was engaged to Xiu, the daughter of Wang Jinsheng from Jiangjianshang (17 years old), with the wedding scheduled for July 24th of this year. On the morning of the 25th, Fan Rongbo went to Shanghai to purchase goods and instructed Hangen to look for black serge in the store. However, due to price disagreements, the deal did not go through. At that time, two men, both about 20 years old and wearing white short shirts and pants, arrived. One stood guard outside, and the other pushed the door open, drew a handgun, and fired two shots at Hangen. His mother, Zhou, suspecting them to be robbers, immediately offered three gold rings. However, the assailant not only refused but also fired two shots at Zhou. At the same time, Fan Suzhen was also shot once. All fell to the ground, lying in a pool of blood, in a tragic state. Hangen died on the spot from injuries to his waist and left arm. Zhou was injured in the abdomen and buttocks, and Suzhen was injured in the lower abdomen. All were sent to Puren Hospital for treatment. Their injuries were severe, and their lives may not be saved. After the incident, the Public Security Bureau's Supervision Office, the Detective Team, and the Fifth Branch of the police force all went to the scene to investigate. Only one shell from a .38 caliber pistol was found. The police took Xu Baoge, a fabric buyer, into custody for questioning and also dispatched officers to the Cangmen, Wuqiao, and Houqijie areas to pursue the assailants. Yesterday morning (the 26th) at 9:00 AM, Wu Rongmo, a local official, and Wang Yonghua, an apprentice from the store, reported the incident to the court and requested an autopsy. In the afternoon at 5:00 PM, Prosecutor Shen went to conduct the autopsy and confirmed that it was a robbery and homicide. He ordered the family to prepare a coffin for burial. According to general speculation, Fan Hangen's tragic death may have been caused by a feud.</p>
<p>Large Quantities of Stolen Coal Shipped to Shanghai</p>
<p>The unscrupulous merchants in this county, who were in contact with the Liujiang Coal Mine to sell stolen coal, encountered disputes over the unloading and storage of the coal, which remained unresolved. The merchants, realizing the difficulty of establishing a foothold in the area, decided to ship the coal to Shanghai to find another way out. Therefore, yesterday they submitted a request to the Wuxi sub-district of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Joint Tax Management Office for a shipping permit to transport the coal to Shanghai on the original ships, store it at the Mitsui &amp; Co. wharf, and then find a way to sell it to other ports. It is said that these stolen coal merchants have suffered losses of over 600 yuan due to their misfortunes.</p>
<p>Changshu: The Opening Date of the Yangfu Road</p>
<p>The Yangfu Road starts from Yangjian Town (where the Xihu Road passes), which borders Wuxi County, passes through the Dahe Port, and reaches Fushan on the Yangtze River, with a total length of 40 kilometers. The Jiangsu Construction Department, entrusted by the National Economic Council, established an engineering office in Changshu to actively carry out the project. The roadbed earthwork, bridges, and culverts will be completed by the end of this month. Yesterday (the 25th), Shen Baozhang, a secretary from the Construction Department, visited the site to inspect the road project. Zhao Xuanzhang, the chief of the engineering office, and Ling Zhibin, the deputy director, accompanied him in a county government-sponsored boat to inspect the route. It is said that the road surface will be 7 meters wide, using yellow sand and gravel, similar to the Suchang Road. Construction is scheduled to begin on the first of next month, with the road surface project to be completed within two months, at which time the entire road will be open to traffic. The operation of passenger buses will likely be undertaken by the Xihu Company.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang: Jiangsu Provincial Local Budget</p>
<p>In early April, the Jiangsu Provincial Finance Department convened representatives from various departments and bureaus to form a Local Budget Review Committee. The committee held 25 review meetings and completed its work in mid-May. After each county's budget was reviewed, the various sub-budgets were revised, and a general budget was compiled, which was then approved by the Provincial Government Committee and distributed to the counties for implementation. The provincial government committee has now completed the review of all county local budgets. The total revenue and expenditure for the 25th year are reduced by more than 628,000 yuan compared to the previous year. The reasons are: (1) To reduce the surcharge on land tax and abolish miscellaneous levies; (2) The land measurement fee will expire and be discontinued next year; (3) Half of the road construction tax revenue will be transferred to the province and not included in the county budget.</p>
<p>Yangzhou: Suspension of Firewood and Charcoal Taxes</p>
<p>The Jiangdu County Government has announced that the Jiangsu Provincial Finance Department has approved the local expenditure budget for the 25th year. The fourth item, "county local taxes," includes firewood and charcoal taxes, which will be eliminated and suspended starting this year. After receiving the order, the County Government has notified the Miscellaneous Tax Office to suspend the collection of firewood and charcoal taxes from July 1st.</p>
<p>Collecting Bicycle Taxes</p>
<p>In recent years, bicycle shops have sprung up in this county, with no fewer than a thousand commercial bicycles in the urban area. In order to facilitate statistics and increase tax revenue, the County Government has decided to implement the collection of license fees and quarterly taxes starting from the 25th year, in accordance with the management regulations promulgated by the Provincial Government, to regulate the industry. The fees are: 5 jiao per quarter for personal bicycles, 1 yuan per quarter for commercial bicycles, and a license fee of 2 jiao for all bicycles.</p>
<p>Nantong: County Magistrate Concurrently Serves as Security Team Leader</p>
<p>Starting from the 3rd of this month, the heads of security brigades in various counties of Jiangsu Province will no longer be concurrently held by the county magistrate. The Provincial Government has ordered the district security commander to report on the local situation in the province and, regarding Article 15, Paragraph 2 of the major security system improvement plan, to decide whether it is necessary to suspend implementation. For the sake of unified responsibility and clear duties, the position of brigade leader will still be held concurrently by the county magistrate starting from July 1st. The original major-ranked brigade adjutant will be reassigned as a major-ranked brigade staff officer. Regarding security expenses, they will temporarily be managed by the district management office.</p>
<p>Gaoyou: The Lijia Bridge Robbed Again</p>
<p>The Lijia Bridge area near the Cheluo Town in the second district of this county was robbed by bandits last year. Yesterday evening, a group of eight or nine bandits armed with firearms and sharp weapons robbed three families, including Jin Shancai and the Lin family, causing significant losses. Liu Chunshan, a merchant from Cheluo Town, and the two village chiefs, Zhang and Liu, concerned that the village was only two li from the town and had been robbed repeatedly, due to the water patrol team being away for centralized training, leaving the defenses empty and the people uneasy, jointly petitioned the local security unit to return to defense and also submitted a request to the 4th district commander of the provincial water police for the return of the local unit.</p>
<p>Danyang: Parricide Case in Jiqing Township</p>
<p>Mao Xiaohai, a resident of Mao Ming's household at No. 6, Jia 2, Bao 2, Jiqing Township, near Erling Town in the third district of the county, returned home late from Erling on the evening of the 16th of this month. Angered by his father's late return, he pressed his father to the ground and stabbed him eight times with a sharp knife. Mao Ming, due to excessive blood loss, died the following morning. After the incident was discovered by Zhu Meigu, the district chief, he reported it to the county government as a rare case of parricide, requesting an autopsy and punishment of the perpetrator. Upon receiving the report, the county government sent Cheng Shen, along with recorder Shi, coroner Gu, and several bailiffs, to the village on the morning of the 25th to conduct an autopsy and handle the case.</p>
<p>Ningbo: Deteriorating Situation in Yao Salt Farms</p>
<p>The Yao Salt Farms have been delaying the collection of salt and payment to salt farmers, causing panic among the salt farmers who depend on it for their livelihood, and asking for relief. After negotiations by the Saltfield Office convening salt merchants, the salt farmers agreed to open collection, but after the event, only Lake Saltfield implemented the collection of five types of salt and did not pay. No action has been taken in eastern Zhejiang, and no payment has been made. Recently, salt farmers heard that the Shaoxing management office of the saltfield was holding a shareholders' meeting and there was news of stopping collection of salt, causing panic. On the 23rd, over a hundred salt farmers crowded to the Ding Tangji office of the Zhejiang East Saltfield, demanding payment. The owner said that the payment was owed by the saltfield, not by the office, and reluctantly took the salt farmers to the saltfield to plead, but no one was in charge, and the salt farmers gathered and refused to leave, so the situation in the salt farms has recently deteriorated again.</p>

<p>Jinan Japanese Company Murder Case</p>
<p>Ando Died, Wife and Servant Injured</p>
<p>Five Murderers Were All Drug Offenders</p>
<p>Four Pieces of Drugs Were Also Robbed</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Ando Heisaburo, manager of the Japanese Shinwa Company at 15 Jingwu Road, Jinan City, was a general merchandise merchant and also had an ice cream store on Jingwu Third Road. At home were his wife, Miki, and a Chinese servant, Wang Zeyan. On the 23rd, five drug dealers entered the company to negotiate a transaction and rested in the Chinese servant Wang Zeyan's room. By evening, Ando Heisaburo had not yet returned from the ice cream store on Jingwu Third Road. His wife, due to customers waiting for goods, sent someone to call Ando back to the company. Unexpectedly, around 10:30 PM, the unknown person suddenly used an axe to violently chop Ando's head. Ando suffered multiple injuries and died on the spot. His wife, Miki, was also injured on the temples of her head, and the Chinese servant Wang Zeyan was also injured on the head at the same time. After committing the crime, the five criminals robbed four pieces of heroin (worth over 2,400 yuan) and ran out through the back door, crossed the empty courtyard wall, and arrived at Jingwu Tenth Road. The area was open and extremely desolate. Zhang Jichou, a police officer from the Fourth Branch of the Public Security Bureau's Commercial Area, was on watch in the area. Because he was a temporary police officer, he did not carry a firearm. The police officer bravely advanced with bare fists and seized the criminal's firearm. The criminal fired at the police officer, who fell to the ground in response. The criminals scattered and fled. The police officer's injury was a bullet shot from the front of the chest, exiting from the right kidney. After the incident, the Public Security Bureau was notified and immediately carried the injured person to Jinan Hospital for treatment. That night, the court sent personnel to the scene for an autopsy and examined the murder axe and bloodstained clothes, making separate records. The police and the Third Road Special Investigation Team searched for the murderers in separate directions but did not find them. On the morning of the 24th, Zhao Qingpei, director of the Public Security Bureau, accompanied Japanese advisor Igetada and two Japanese police officers to inspect the scene. After receiving the report, Han Fuju, chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, also ordered the detective team and police to strictly apprehend the murderers and offered a reward of 1,000 yuan, limiting the time to solve the case to ten days. In the afternoon of the 24th, Japanese Consul Hashimoto visited Chairman Han Fuju at the Provincial Government to express his satisfaction with Han's serious apprehension of the murderers. It is said that several suspects have been arrested and are being investigated separately. (June 24th)</p>

<p>This City's News</p>
<p>Resolution to Form a Smuggling Inspection Committee</p>
<p>Nine People First Appointed as Ex-Officio Members</p>
<p>Letters Sent to Nineteen Associations to Recommend Members to Participate</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce held its twentieth Executive Committee meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. Over twenty people, including Xu Jiyu, Yun Qing, Jin Runquan, Zheng Zenan, etc., attended. Chairman Yu Zuoting was away in Ningbo on business, and Jin Runquan was elected as the temporary chairman. The following motions were discussed: (1) In accordance with the resolution of the members' representative assembly, a Smuggling Inspection Committee was established. Xu Jiyu, Jin Runquan, Hu Xiyuan, Pei Yunqing, Luo Qinghua, Ge Jiechen, Shen Tianxin, and Zheng Zenan were appointed as ex-officio members. Letters were sent to the nineteen relevant trade associations, each recommending one member to serve on the committee. The remaining members will be appointed by the next Executive Committee.

<p>Discussion in the Velvet Industry</p>
<p>The velvet industry in this city is facing a glut of smuggled goods, hindering business. In addition to repeatedly notifying its members to refuse to sell smuggled goods, it also sends people to conduct strict investigations and make accusations at any time. It has also recommended Ge Jiechen, Wu Mingsheng, and Tong Shuangyang as representatives to meet with the Deputy Superintendent of Customs to discuss the methods of transshipping original boxes and finished goods. The customs has already made separate regulations. The method of transshipping small quantities of goods is being researched and discussed. The trade association will review it and issue a certificate of joint form. Furthermore, the attending representatives proposed that while there should be severe crackdowns on preventing smuggling, there must also be consistency and mutual protection in legitimate business. However, it was discovered that goods currently in transit through Manchuria and Mongolia only pay 7.5% of the factory price in taxes and can be sold within our country. This has a significant impact on regular goods imported with a tax of around 55%. The disadvantages are even greater than smuggling because the Manchurian and Mongolian goods are exported, transshipped, and transported jointly, as mentioned above, and only pay 7.5% in taxes. Therefore, all smuggled goods can use Manchuria and Mongolia as a cover, and it will be impossible to control them. It should be requested that the customs pay special attention to this. After discussion, it was resolved that this issue had already been raised to the Deputy Superintendent of Customs by the three representatives for the tax authorities to study. However, this problem is not superficially within the scope of smuggling, but it is more serious than smuggling in practice. Therefore, it should be submitted by the Smuggling Prevention Committee to the government for planning.</p>

<p>Letter. To the esteemed chief editor of Shen Bao: I am writing to you regarding the report on the 25th of this month about Mr. Fang Gengfu, manager of the Gong Sheng Nan Huo store in this city, who committed suicide by swallowing opium because of losses and feeling ashamed to face the shareholders. This is purely inconsistent with the facts and is probably a rumor that is inaccurate and harms my late father's reputation. I should list the facts below and request that they be published to correct the record and clarify the truth. I would be very grateful. Sincerely, Ann. "My late father, Fang Gengfu, managed Gong Sheng Store for nearly 20 years and earned hundreds of thousands of yuan. In addition to the shareholders receiving dividends many times, there was still about 200,000 yuan owed by the shareholders, all of which can be checked in the records. The facts are all there. There were no losses and no reason to feel ashamed to face the shareholders. Only because a small number of shareholders harbored grudges and deliberately made things difficult for my late father, he was excessively stimulated and committed suicide in anger, leaving Shunpu with endless regret. My late father was upright and self-disciplined throughout his life, and he always valued his reputation, which is well known to the business community in this city and does not need to be elaborated by Shunpu." Transmitted by Fang Shunpu, June 25th, 25th year of the Republic of China.</p>

<p>Era of Medicine Publication: Infectious Venereal Diseases (i.e., Sexually Transmitted Diseases). By Dr. Yao Erchang, Doctor of Medicine from Benscheveni University, USA.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea and Its Symptoms. "What is gonorrhea and where does it come from?" Gonorrhea is a special inflammation of the inner lining of the male urethra. When afflicted, a white discharge flows out, so it is also called leucorrhea. It is the most common of the infectious venereal diseases. It is caused by the patient being infected with the bacteria that cause gonorrhea - diplococci. Without the invasion of gonorrhea bacteria, gonorrhea will never occur, this is an undeniable truth. Many people think that gonorrhea can also arise from physical weakness. In fact, this statement does not conform to scientific medical theory. Indeed, some people develop gonorrhea because of their weakness, but these people either have a recurrence of an old illness or are unconsciously infected with gonorrhea bacteria, and only then do they have this symptom. If there are no gonorrhea bacteria at work, even if the body is extremely weak, he will not develop gonorrhea. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Effective Treatment for Gonorrhea. In the past, the most effective treatment for this condition was the injection of chromotherapy. However, because chromotherapy injections have the drawbacks of causing pigmentation and inflammation, the medical community sees it as the only drawback. Since the recent invention of the oral chromotherapy preparation "Anti-Gonorrhea," because it has the same effect as chromotherapy injections, but without all its drawbacks, it is the only effective holy medicine for treating gonorrhea in recent times. Last month, I used it to cure Mr. Zeng's acute new leucorrhea and Mr. Gu's chronic old leucorrhea and its complications such as orchitis and other dangerous conditions, all of which have been proven to have the most satisfactory and effective results.</p>
<p>Brain Weakness - Seminal Thinness. By Dr. Yu Bofu. The brain is the highest spiritual center of the human body. Its nutrition depends entirely on the sublimation of semen. Anyone who commits masturbation or is addicted to ejaculation, or who also suffers from spermatorrhea, has thin semen and feels brain weakness. Then symptoms such as dizziness, blurred vision, insomnia, and forgetfulness arise. The treatment method should focus on tonifying the brain and semen. Patient Mr. Zheng complained of symptoms such as thin semen, brain weakness, insomnia, and forgetfulness last winter. After questioning him, I learned that he also suffered from spermatorrhea and fear. I immediately instructed him to purchase "Simito's Sperm Fortifying Tablets" from a Chinese and Western pharmacy to strengthen his sperm gates, and to take "Reproduction Element" to tonify the semen and strengthen the brain. Once the nocturnal emission was cured, the semen was sufficient, the brain was nourished, and all the symptoms disappeared. He immediately turned strong and healthy. Before and after comparison, it was like two different people.</p>
<p>Treatment for Kidney Atrophy and Lack of Offspring. By Ren Guoxiang. Patient Mr. Xue, with a history of masturbation and early marriage, suffered significant damage to his reproductive glands. After marriage, he suffered from sexual weakness, which was neglected and mistreated for a long time. The illness became more severe, resulting in the loss of his husband's duties. Not only did he lose his strength and health, but also developed many illnesses and his vitality was extinguished. He had no hope of offspring. It was not until last winter that he came to me for treatment through the introduction of his best friend. I found out the root cause of Mr. Xue's illness and knew that ordinary preparations could not be effective. I immediately instructed him to purchase "Reproduction Element" from Wing On Company and take it for half a dozen boxes in a row. The reproductive glands recovered and prospered. The premature ejaculation subsided suddenly. The feelings between husband and wife were better than at the wedding. According to him, his vitality and happiness were all given by the famous medicine "Reproduction Element," which was no less than reborn parents.</p>
<p>Smoking Cessation Experience. By Dr. Wang Shiying. Smokers are poisoned by nicotine. Their bodies and spirits are completely controlled by nicotine addiction. If they quit suddenly, their physiology and psychology will change suddenly, which is unbearable for smokers. Or they will be mentally depressed, or there will be various diseases. The most common ones are insomnia, spermatorrhea, stomach weakness, and mental fatigue. Safety is difficult to ensure. Success is difficult to achieve. Prohibition is violated. Extreme punishment is difficult to avoid. Therefore, a safe method of quitting is what everyone wants to study. I am based on clinical experience and will give an example to contribute a little of my wisdom.</p>
<p>(1) Safe Smoking Cessation with Bone Pain. This spring, Mr. Zha came to seek to quit smoking. I diagnosed that he was suffering from bone pain, so I instructed him to purchase "Strong Stone's Bone Pain Tablets" from Taihe Pharmacy to treat it. Once the bone pain was cured, I started to give him "Reproduction Element" to cultivate and supplement his smoking cessation. During the smoking cessation period, he was safe and happy, strong and healthy. At the same time, he was injected with "Yuwei Ci Life-Saving" to further shorten the smoking cessation period to no more than a month.</p>
<p>(2) Smoking Cessation with Leukorrhea and Stomach Pain. Last month, Mrs. Chou came to quit smoking. According to her, she was suffering from Leukorrhea and stomach pain. I immediately instructed her to purchase "Stomach Pain Ling" from Wing On Company to treat her stomach pain and use "Leukorrhea Ling" to treat her Leukorrhea. After the ailments were cured, I instructed her to take "Female Reproduction Element" to cultivate and supplement her smoking cessation. At the same time, I injected "Yuwei Ci Life-Saving" to supplement her. In less than a month, she quickly recovered her strength. Nicotine was completely eliminated. She regained her beauty from that year.</p>
<p>Sexual Weakness and Spermatorrhea Gladly Obtained a Son. By Jia Zhizhong. Patient Mr. Ma, 35 years old. In his early years, he suffered significant damage to his reproductive glands due to excessive masturbation. He suffered from spermatorrhea. After marriage, he felt even weaker and hastened. He tried every means to regulate it, but could not eradicate it. He has been married for many years and has no children. His vitality is cut off. His health disappeared. His wife ridiculed him. He suffered physically and mentally. Symptoms of weakness arose in various forms. Last spring, his neighbor Mr. Li, who suffered from kidney atrophy, was cured by me using "Reproduction Element." He was introduced to me for treatment. I found that his vas deferens was relaxed. I mainly used "Simito's Sperm Strengthening Tablets" to strengthen his sperm gates. Spermatorrhea was immediately eliminated. However, his premature ejaculation and other symptoms were all caused by masturbation and spermatorrhea. I immediately instructed him to purchase "Reproduction Element" from Wuzhou Pharmacy and take it for several boxes in a row. The reproductive glands returned to health. All the symptoms disappeared one by one. His body immediately became strong and healthy. The feelings between husband and wife were restored. Sweetness was better than the wedding. This spring, I received a letter from him thanking me, saying that he has now gladly obtained a son. All thanks to good doctors and famous medicines.</p>
<p>Leukorrhea can be treated at home. By Dr. Wu Dachao. Leukorrhea is a disease that women are prone to suffer from. However, because most patients are shy, they are unwilling to tell others. They sit and brew the disease, causing serious harm. If it persists, the vaginal tract is mostly eroded by bacteria and viruses, causing inflammation and erosion, leading to difficult menstruation and causing infertility. The treatment should be to insert a Leukorrhea Ling tablet into the vaginal tract every other night. The method is simple and there are no drawbacks. It is most suitable for secret self-treatment at home. If Leukorrhea is caused by the husband's transmission of gonorrhea, in addition to this external treatment, you can also take "Anti-Gonorrhea" internally to expel gonorrhea bacteria. If it is caused by physical weakness and menstrual diseases, you can take "Female Reproduction Element" internally at the same time to heal the weakness, regulate menstruation and nourish the blood. Therefore, "Leukorrhea Ling" is really a shortcut for women suffering from Leukorrhea to treat themselves. All those who suffer from Leukorrhea should pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Safe Smoking Cessation Experience. Mr. Feng from Disiwei Road said (omitted above). After I became addicted to smoking, I tried every means to quit because of various inconveniences. However, I always gave up halfway because of various pains. Last year, because the government was determined to ban smoking, my peers asked me to quit one after another. I saw that my friend Mr. Yang was happy when he quit and did not have the pain that other quitters had. I secretly asked him about the details. I learned that Mr. Yang took "Reproduction Element" during the quitting period, so he had no pain and his spirit was a hundredfold. His body was strong. I also purchased it from Wuzhou Pharmacy. After taking it for about a month, the nicotine addiction was extinguished. Weight increased. During the quitting period, I was happy. After quitting, I hated cigarettes. This is a miraculous remedy for smoking cessation.</p>
<p>Medication Report. By Dr. Liu Zhimin. Premature Aging: Patient Mr. Geng was born weak and often sick. He lost his conditioning. His body was even thinner. He was young, but his appearance was already old. He had back pain and various other symptoms. This spring, he was introduced by his best friend to take "Reproduction Element" for only three weeks. All the symptoms disappeared. He recovered his strength. He regained his youthful and full appearance.</p>
<p>Leukorrhea and Frequent Urination: Patient Mr. Lu accidentally went to the red light district after drinking, resulting in Leukorrhea. Frequent urination was painful. He mistakenly took cheap and inferior drugs and lost the opportunity to treat the disease. It became chronic. Complications occurred repeatedly. Later, he took "Anti-Gonorrhea," a famous medicine that effectively treats Leukorrhea. After taking it, his urine gradually became clear. He continued to take several boxes in a row. Leukorrhea disappeared and his body became healthy. He regained his vitality. Last month, he mentioned that his wife was several months pregnant.</p>
<p>Bone Pain and Smoking Cessation: Mr. Qin, who was addicted to smoking for a long time, tried to quit many times. He failed because he suffered from bone and joint pain. In early spring, Dr. Zhan Nianzeng introduced him to take "Strong Stone's Bone Pain Tablets" to heal his bone pain. He took "Reproduction Element" to safely quit smoking. At the same time, he injected "Yuwei Ci Life-Saving" to supplement him, which shortened the smoking cessation period. In less than a month, the toxins were eliminated and the addiction was broken. He recovered the strength he had never had before.</p>
<p>Venereal Disease Lecture. Compiled by Dr. Zhan Nianzeng and Dr. Yao Erchang. (Clinic) Second floor of China Trust Company, corner of Sichuan Road and Beijing Road (Outpatient) 10 AM to 6 PM. Closed on Sundays. (1) Masturbation, Early Marriage, and Difficult Childbirth: Patient Mr. Xi, 39 years old. From Chongming. Works in the industrial sector. Mr. Xi was first injured by masturbation and then by early marriage. His natural endowment was weak. He was also overworked, resulting in a weak body. He suffered from premature ejaculation. For 20 years, he had no children. He was indecisive and thought there was no cure. Last autumn, he was introduced by a colleague and came to my clinic for treatment. After I told him the way to maintain his health and applied the latest scientific surgery and electrical therapy, and instructed him to take reproductive gland hormone preparations, he felt that his body was stronger, his waist and back were stronger, and his body was full of vitality. He regained his youth. The premature ejaculation was completely cured. The feelings between husband and wife were better than at the wedding. Before the Qingming Festival, I met an engineer by special visit and met Mr. Xi without prior agreement. According to him, his wife has been pregnant for several months.</p>
<p>(2) Spermatorrhea, Forgetfulness, Back Pain: Patient Mr. Shi, 23 years old. From Wuxian. Academic world. In his early years, Mr. Shi was poisoned by pornographic books and mistakenly committed the bad habit of self-indulgence. He has been cutting down vigorously for many years. The loss was quite severe. As a result, his body was damaged. He suffered from spermatorrhea and nocturnal emission. At first, it was often several times a month. Later, it reached more than ten times a month. He was exhausted. His studies declined sharply. Gradually, insomnia, forgetfulness, back pain and other symptoms arose in various forms. Later, he was introduced by his cousin and came to my clinic for treatment in mid-October last winter. After using radio wave induction therapy and taking sperm-strengthening medicine to strengthen his sperm gates and treat his spermatorrhea, he soon reported a complete cure. In order to cultivate and supplement his losses, he bought and took reproductive gland hormone preparations. After taking it for more than a month, he felt that he had regained his youth. He was able to sleep peacefully at night. His memory recovered. His waist and back were stronger. His studies progressed rapidly. His body was strong and healthy. It was as if he had changed into a different person.</p>
<p>(Note) Reproductive gland hormone preparations "Reproduction Element" have special effects on treating weakness and venereal diseases. Sperm-strengthening medicine "Simito's Sperm Strengthening Tablets" specializes in treating spermatorrhea, nocturnal emission, insomnia, and anxiety. Clinical case reports on venereal disease and smoking cessation. Wu Dachao, Bachelor of Medicine, University of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Leukorrhea and Bone Pain are Hard to Bear: Leukorrhea gonorrhea, if not treated early, the toxins will spread and cause complications such as orchitis, swollen bones, and joint pain. It is difficult to have children. It is difficult to enjoy health. Various diseases occur. The suffering is greatest. In treating this disease, I have used the latest newly invented chromotherapy oral preparations. I took it because it has the same effect as chromotherapy injections, but it does not have all the side effects of injections.</p>
<p>Recently, I used "Anti-Gonorrhea" to cure acute and chronic Gonorrhea of Mr. Ma and Mr. Pan, and I used "Strong Stone's Bone Pain Tablets" to cure Gonorrhea arthritis and bone and joint pain of Mr. Huang and Mr. Guo. The time was not more than one month. (Note) Various medicines are sold in Wing On Company, Chinese and Western Taihe and major pharmacies.</p>
<p>Long-Term Smoking Addiction for Husband and Wife Quit Together: The formation of nicotine addiction is caused by chronic opium poisoning. Smokers have a lack of reproductive gland hormone formation. The whole body loses its original good nutrition and relies entirely on the paralyzing and exciting power of opium to seek invigoration for a while. It is not normal. If you quit, you will affect inertia. The whole body will feel all kinds of discomfort. If you have stomach pain and other diseases, they will all appear at this time. Addiction, toxins, diseases, and pain are connected and related. If the treatment is wrong, it will be difficult to succeed. This is why quitters often give up halfway. To quit smoking, it is necessary to remove the toxins, and the supplementation of reproductive gland hormone is the top priority for prescribing the right medicine. Increase its resistance. Nicotine will be removed without being removed. Therefore, for a safe way to quit smoking, there is no other option than reproductive gland hormone.</p>
<p>At the end of spring, Mr. Yan and his wife came to quit. I ordered them to use male and female "Reproduction Element" to remove toxins, break the addiction, eliminate decline, and strengthen the body. As for stomach pain and Leukorrhea, I used "Stomach Pain Ling" internally and "Leukorrhea Ling" externally to treat them. Once the ailments were cured, quitting smoking was safer. At the same time, I injected "Yuwei Ci Life-Saving" to supplement them. Therefore, they were able to shorten the smoking cessation period to less than one month.</p>

<p>Sports News: Embarking on the Olympic Journey. Delegation Departed Yesterday Afternoon. Mayor Wu and Yang Hu, Among Others, Personally Went to the Pier to See Them Off. Swimming Representatives to Board Ship Tomorrow. The Chinese World Games delegation boarded the Italian Conte Verde ship yesterday at the North Bund Wharf of the China Merchants Bureau. All the departure formalities had been completed in advance. However, Hao Chunde, an alternate member of the track and field team, and Zhou Changxing, who participated in the competition at his own expense, suddenly paid the departure fees on the night before and yesterday morning, respectively. Therefore, the ship tickets and cabins were only arranged at the last minute with the general affairs office of the ship. The Chinese delegation to the World Games and the sports inspection delegation to Germany, with the exception of those who have already departed, totaling 111 people, were led by Shen Siliang and Hao Gengsheng and departed on the Italian mail ship Conte Verde at 12:30 PM yesterday. More than 1,000 representatives from all walks of life went to the pier to see them off, and the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. The German Consul General, Klibe, also expressed his best wishes to the Chinese delegation for success and victory. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>More than 1,000 People Arrived at the Pier to See Them Off. The Conte Verde ship was moored at the North Bund Wharf of the China Merchants Bureau. The national flag and the flags of various organizations were hung at the main entrance. Those who went to the pier to see them off included: Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Songhu Garrison Commander Yang Xiaotian, Central Committee Member Chu Minyi, Director of Education Pan Gongzhan, Director of Public Security Cai Jinjun, Section Chief of the Municipal Government Li Dachao, German Consul Klibe, Wang Zhinan, Huang Jingwan, Lu Lihua, Xia Xiaoyu, the German Boy Scouts, the Chinese Sports Association, the Municipal Sports Association, the Municipal National Arts Museum, the Chinese Sports Association, the Southeast Women's Physical Education School, the Liangjiang Physical Education School, the Chinese Women's Physical Education School, Minzhi School, Private Shangzhong, the Shanghai Municipal Council Girls' School, Zhiguang Society, Kuaiyi Society, the Guangdong Fellow-Townsmen Association, the Diligent Sports Monthly Magazine, and other groups, as well as relatives and friends of the delegation members and reporters from various newspapers, totaling more than 1,000 people.</p>
<p>Setting Sail for a Long Journey of Thousands of Miles. All the welcoming groups held welcoming flags and presented flowers. The pier was crowded with people, an unprecedented scene. The bands of the Public Security Bureau and the Garrison Headquarters played music in turn, melodious and solemn. Everyone had endless hopes and attachment to the long journey of thousands of miles of the delegation. The Conte Verde set sail at 12:30 PM, slowly leaving the shore. For a time, colorful ribbons were flying, firecrackers were set off, and people were waving handkerchiefs and hats, and the atmosphere was enthusiastic. The Chinese Aviation Association also sent a plane to fly over the sky, delivering the delegation to the outside of Wusongkou before returning. A reporter from the Central News Agency traveled on the same ship.</p>
<p>A Total of 111 People. Those who left Shanghai yesterday afternoon included 22 staff members, 53 athletes, and 36 members of the inspection delegation, for a total of 111 people. Zhou Changxing, Zhang Jiakui, Situ Guang, and Hao Chunde were all included. The ship is scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong on the 28th. Swimmers Yang Yuqiong and Chen Zhenxing, football player Huang Jiliang, and inspection delegation member Ye Guanyu will also travel on the same ship. After the closing ceremony of the Games, the delegation will travel to neighboring countries of Germany for sightseeing and hold performance competitions to learn from each other.</p>
<p>Shen Liang Talks About the Purpose of This Trip. According to Shen Siliang, the general secretary of the delegation, he told the Central News Agency reporter before his departure that he had received a telegram from the chief leader, Wang Zhengting, saying that he would arrive in Berlin on the 23rd of this month. The purpose of participating in the World Games is that China's sports are backward, so we dare not hope for victory. But we hope to take this opportunity to learn from each other and learn from the strengths of others to seek future development. The main purpose of sending more than 30 people to form the inspection delegation is to obtain a large amount of harvest so that we can develop sports throughout the country after returning home.</p>
<p>Hao Gengsheng Talks About the Inspection Plan. Hao Gengsheng, the leader of the inspection delegation, told reporters that during the Games, the inspection delegation will concentrate on exploring the technical aspects of athletes from various countries. After the closing ceremony of the Games, they will begin the inspection work. They will visit Germany, Italy, France, Sweden, Denmark, and other countries one after another to search in detail for the facilities, training, education, and technical issues of sports in various countries as a basis for the development of sports in our country. The detailed inspection schedule will be discussed and decided on the ship. The delegation's head coach, Ma Yuehan, and coaches Dong Shouyi and Song Junfu will go to the United Kingdom and the United States for inspection after the event, which will last for one year. They will not return home with the delegation. Mayor Wu and Commander Yang personally went to the pier to see them off. Yang Hu, Wu Tiecheng, Li Sen. (Photo by Ye Changlie)</p>

<p>Like a living Buddha going on tour, the people were all in sincere fear and trepidation, shouting "Long live the county magistrate!" This scene, when you think about it, is truly laughable. Who would have thought that twenty-five years after the founding of the Republic of China, there would still be this kind of official putting on airs before the people? Recently, the Executive Yuan has measures to punish corrupt officials and rapacious bureaucrats, so can this kind of county magistrate, who is "utterly disgraceful," be lightly let off?</p>
<p>If it were just "the county magistrate parading the streets," it would merely be a strange drama in local administration. However, things certainly wouldn't be that simple. If one can act powerful and authoritative before the masses in such a disgraceful manner, then of course one can also use excuses to levy exorbitant taxes and fees. Sure enough, this county magistrate of Yumen County, after his "street parade," came up with a "Spring Festival fee," extorting one dime from each household. From this, we can easily imagine that in those places where "the mountains are high and the emperor is far away," feudal forces are still disguised as some separatist warlords; at the same time, we can further imagine how the good and honest people under these local officials, who rely on feudal forces to exploit and oppress the people, are able to live their lives. Those who have local responsibility, what thoughts do they have on this?</p>
<p>Ambition Xu Ji</p>
<p>In a corrupt and gloomy ancient city, after being arranged in another kind of medieval, base life for twenty years, Mr. Lin Jing had indeed completely changed. That change was not only because a few more lines of life had been added to his young, broad forehead; not only because he had changed from the student attire of twenty years ago to a long gown and short jacket; not only because he had changed the frank, sincere, joyful, and bright smile of the past into an artificial, flattering, and insidious smile; not only... No, in short, this was not just a change in outward appearance and age, but a fundamental, internal, and complete transformation. This belonged to the education of the era, of life, of the world and the environment...</p>
<p>The education of life is like the fire in a furnace, it may be able to turn iron into something like steel, but wouldn't it also turn some other substances into ashes? But who believes this fact? At least, Mr. Lin Jing himself did not admit it. He always had a kind of ambition towards life, he had it in his youth, and doesn't he still "have" it now? Even though sometimes he himself felt that the current him was a little different from the him of twenty years ago, that feeling was still vague in his mind, and wasn't he already almost "fifty" years old now? And in the past... in the past, he was only in his twenties. People in their thirties, in his current view, are mostly frivolous and shallow.</p>
<p>For example, from the bodies of the current "twenty-something people," can't one still discover one or two miniature versions of Mr. Lin Jing himself from many years ago? At that time, in young blood, there was such a strange ambition, colliding, testing, and striving everywhere. Everywhere, attempting to find some real human joy—as long as it was "real," even if it was tears—and everywhere, pursuing human "truth" and "righteousness," wanting to use his own labor to fairly make a good life, imagining himself like a wild ox, running on desolate land, using his solid hooves to plow the rugged dirt road. However, this "ambition," now looked at, was so "naive and laughable," so close to an "unintelligent" fantasy. The world was still so desolate and terrible, the days were still so bad, and the individual's lovely youthful "ambition" seemed so small. Thus, Mr. Lin Jing walked out of his youth, became an adult, became middle-aged. He was being educated by this base and filthy society, being educated by his own incompetence and ignorance. He had multiplied in this corrupt ancient city for twenty years—that was a long time—and so in another kind of furnace, Mr. Lin Jing was learning day by day. He compromised, he learned to be amiable and perfunctory, and all of this was useful to our unintelligent world and era. Thus, in the small ancient city, there was also a person like Mr. Lin Jing—gentleman, clerk, section chief, school board member, and philanthropist... His days became better and better along with his reputation, and the "truthful" and "righteous" aspects of humanity became more and more blurred, and finally, faded away in the erosion of the years and were forgotten.</p>
<p>Now, old Mr. Lin Jing still has ambition, but it is said that he has gotten rid of the "youthful spirit and shallowness" (?), and has become more "profound" (—). In any case, life is good, the world is full of splendor, and it is necessary to make one's own life good—prosperous, developed, and prominent. Even if it is small, it is "practical" and "beneficial."</p>
<p>Thus, this "ambition" in life pulled him far, far away, causing him to bid farewell to true youth; now he is fifty, he is middle-aged. Middle-aged people do not think of anything other than themselves. Just like all middle-aged people, Mr. Lin Jing's ambition now belongs to an unintelligent humanity: casting aside all lovely dreams, he lives according to that new "ambition" without compromise. Flattering or base, but one day, Mr. Lin Jing's reputation will become even greater, the numbers on the property catalog will increase, the concubine's charming smile will become even more enchanting, and the enjoyment of life will become even better.</p>
<p>Everything is truly different from the past—everything has undergone a great change.</p>
<p>That ambition in life is... "profound"...</p>
<p>Mosquito Swarm Wu Fenghuan</p>
<p>When I was a child, I read a lesson in school called "The Mosquito Swarm of San Francisco." That lesson described the "mosquito swarm" as fierce and terrifying! Even all of us classmates who had never suffered from the harm of "mosquito swarms" hated and resented mosquitoes. I don't know why, but I felt that the "mosquito swarm" was mysterious and lovely. Perhaps it was because there were so few mosquitoes where we lived? Originally, along our coastline, the sea breeze blew all year round, and mosquitoes probably didn't like to come? But I couldn't believe that there wouldn't be "mosquito swarms" in our area? It's just that no one else had discovered them. From then on, I made up my mind to discover them: after every dusk in the summer, I would sneak out of the house behind my family's backs and secretly run to the outside of the village. That place was farther from the sea, on the meadows, in the rice paddies, in the woods, by the river, in the vegetable gardens... I searched everywhere, ah, it was so frustrating, I couldn't find a "mosquito swarm"! But I didn't get discouraged, I wandered around those places until dark, because I wanted to take the risk of making this great discovery, so I didn't feel scared, I was really brave. When the people at home realized I was missing, they all panicked and searched everywhere. My father scolded my mother, and my mother almost cried out my name: "Ah Huan!" The whole village was alarmed! By the time I returned to my mother's side, I was already a little wet. That night, my grandmother hid me in her room so that my father wouldn't beat me. The second time this happened, my father was as angry as a wild ox and beat me half to death. From then on, I dared not go out to look for "mosquito swarms" again. The pain in my flesh made me despair and abandon my curiosity. Now I understand that there are absolutely no "mosquito swarms" in our coastal area.</p>
<p>When I was fourteen years old, my uncle took me to Dalian. Not long after arriving in Dalian, he sent my younger brother and me to the YMCA summer school. There were people of various nationalities in that school: Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, Taiwanese, and also White Russians who were often ridiculed by Japanese children. At first, everyone was unfamiliar and indifferent, but before long, everyone became close. They spoke Chinese quite fluently, so we got along very well. After class, we ran to the beach to play and tell stories, and that's when we got involved with "mosquito swarms." Walansky was the best storyteller among us children. He told us a story about a Ukrainian "mosquito swarm." The gist of it was: in the southern part of Ukraine, there are "mosquito swarms" every summer. People and livestock have to use mosquito repellent tools, otherwise they will be killed by the mosquito swarms. Once, a farmer got drunk and lay down in the courtyard at night. The next morning, he died. After his death, others found countless blood spots on his body and realized that he had been killed by mosquitoes." This story was very unreasonable, it could simply be said to be fabricated, but Walansky said that his grandmother told him that it was definitely not made up by herself.</p>
<p>When I saw "mosquito swarms" in Beiping, I no longer thought they were mysterious. In the dirty places outside the city, there were always many "mosquito swarms" at night, especially near the manure yard outside Yongdingmen and Deshengmen. Those "mosquito swarms" were indeed terrifying. As soon as it got dark, you could see every household making smoke to drive away the "mosquito swarms." The situation was completely different in the city. There were a few mosquitoes, but they weren't as bad as bedbugs.</p>
<p>Now I am staying in Shanghai. Before summer came, I asked my friends, and they didn't know what "mosquito swarms" were, they just said: "You don't have to worry, you can live anywhere along Avenue Joffre and there won't be any mosquitoes." But just after spring, I left Avenue Joffre and went to live in Xujiahui. For the sake of life, I lived in a place close to the countryside.</p>
<p>In front of our door is a green meadow. People come to take a walk in the early morning and at dusk. Perhaps people are greedy for fresh air? Some men and women even play on the grass from dusk until dark. Once it gets dark, this place is no longer a peaceful place. A terrifying mosquito swarm flies from the polluted water in the south, buzzing and occupying the meadow, constantly attacking people. Everyone leaves here without resistance.</p>
<p>Although I myself can leave the meadow, I have to go home to sleep. However, my house is completely surrounded by "mosquito swarms." As soon as I fall asleep, I am bitten awake, as soon as I fall asleep, I am bitten awake. I can wake up seven or eight times a night. My sleep is completely shattered by them! I can't drive them away! I have also bought and used mosquito coils, but the effect is too small, it just costs a few more copper coins. Every night, bumps appear on my skin. I know that the mosquitoes are killing me, but there is nothing I can do, unless I have the money to get a mosquito net to resist the "mosquito swarms."</p>
<p>Grandmother's Chickens Hua Mu</p>
<p>My family raises chickens all year round, and the eggs used for cooking on weekdays are taken from those few hens. When there are too many chickens, they are naughty and often scatter chicken droppings all over the floor and knock things over. Sometimes, they are really annoying. My mother has a good cleanliness habit. When a chicken makes trouble in the kitchen, she often picks up a broom and drives them away at will, hitting the chickens so that they fly around and squawk loudly. When my grandmother sees this, she naturally has something to say, often causing people to laugh.</p>
<p>The chickens are all raised by my grandmother alone. Which hen will lay eggs, which one will hatch chicks, which one has a bad temper, and which one is docile—my grandmother is very familiar with all these things. Every time I go back and happen to be there for feeding the chickens in the evening, my grandmother will hold a cane in one hand and point to the chickens that are pecking at food with the other, telling me everything without missing a detail. With the younger siblings adding fuel to the fire, I feel even more affectionate and interested in these chickens, which reminds me of my childhood.</p>
<p>Although my grandmother loves raising chickens so much, the results are very poor. She believes in something called "blood wealth" and always attributes the failure in this area</p>
<p>Page 21</p>
<p>Page 22</p>
<p>Page 23</p>
<p>to her own bad "blood wealth." Only once, that was the year I was born, she hatched two broods of chicks and raised them all to be over a catty without losing a single one. When this matter is mentioned, even my mother, who doesn't love chickens, will happily chime in. However, these thirty-odd chickens weighing over a catty were eventually stolen in a cage one night by a small thief. In addition to feeling distressed, she naturally blamed it on her bad "blood wealth." Every time chicks are hatched, my grandmother always repeats this story over and over again, and at the end, she adds a counter-argument tail, considering this batch of hatched chicks to be an exception, and for the egg types that are about to be hatched, she is bound to evoke a full and satisfactory hope. However, as far as I can remember, my grandmother's hope has really never been realized. This makes my mother often use it as a topic of conversation behind her back, half angry and half laughing.</p>
<p>Every year in early February, hens lay particularly many eggs, and this is when my grandmother starts hatching chicks. She always chooses the time to put the hen on the nest at night when the lamps are lit, and the number of eggs must be even. The work of putting the eggs on the nest is always assigned to me, saying that this way more big chickens can be hatched. My grandmother holds the lamp next to me, mumbling and extremely solemnly, not knowing what she is chanting. I move the eggs one by one from a bamboo basket to the prepared nest and put them in. Then, my aunt catches the hen and gently puts it in, and then sincerely instructs the hen with a few words of encouragement. Only then is the nest-setting ceremony completed. After the chicks hatch, they gradually become stronger and healthier, and often leave their mothers and walk into the open courtyard without any shelter, pecking here and jumping there. Then, gradually, one by one, eagles suddenly descend from mid-air and snatch them away with their iron claws to serve as food. Later, my grandmother became anxious and locked the remaining chicks in the courtyard, chirping and chattering all day long. Perhaps because they lacked exercise, and my grandmother was reluctant to use white rice, she only fed the chicks white rice soaked in water, making them more susceptible to disease. No one knew how it happened, but one night, a mosquito bit them on the eyelid, and in a few days, a large lump stuck to their small eyes. When my mother saw it, she would say, half angry and half laughing:</p>
<p>—Look, Grandma's chicken is dozing off again! This caused everyone to laugh. After a few more days like this, the chicks were all gone, leaving only one hen still looking around, clucking and searching for its chicks.</p>
<p>However, my grandmother would not be discouraged by hatching chicks, so the second brood of chicks hatched, and the result was that only one hen was left walking around, looking around, and clucking.</p>
<p>This year, my grandmother is eighty-five years old, and because of her many illnesses, her body has weakened a lot. But I think her enthusiasm for hatching chicks must still be as strong as ever. Although I am not at home, my younger brothers will put her on the nest for her. Now it is March again, and her chicks should have hatched long ago. Let me wish her a complete harvest!</p>
<p>Reading "Ten Records of Southern Travels" (Part 1) Tai Sheng</p>
<p>I remember someone saying: "Going on a trip can change a person's temperament." What this means is that during the journey of a trip, you can gain many life experiences, because during your trip, you can at least come into contact with people from all walks of life, even people you would normally never talk to. When you embark on a lonely journey, they are your closest companions.</p>
<p>At the same time, in this "extraordinary period," if we can use travel to observe the economy, politics, and all aspects of the current society under the wave of economic depression, as well as the conditions of commerce, trade, politics, and transportation in various places under imperialist aggression, and conduct a systematic investigation, then what we gain should be ten million times more valuable than reading books for ten years!</p>
<p>Recently, after reading "Ten Records of Southern Travels" written by Zhao Junhao, I feel even more strongly that travel gives us great significance.</p>

<p>The Northeast is Our Territory. Why Don't We Go Back With Guns?</p>
<p>After the Experimental Little Theater was forced to stop performing, internal work became even more tense. On the one hand, it is actively preparing for the third performance, and on the other hand, the theater's year-round legal advisor, lawyer Shi Liang, is directly negotiating with the Public Works Department. It is said that the theater will not stop until the performances of "Corner" and "Autumn Sun" can continue, and absolute freedom of performing plays in the future is guaranteed.</p>
<p>The Haiyan Drama Society, in view of the most urgent need to fight for the survival of the people, is sparing no effort to establish a "national defense drama" movement. It is currently busy organizing a mobile performance team to go to the countryside to call for a united front for national salvation. It published a request for team members and members a few days ago, and hundreds of people asked for the regulations, which shows the society's love and attention in the society. It is actively rehearsing the scripts of "Echo," "Poison," "Father and Son Brothers," and "Living Road."</p>
<p>Originally, in order to quickly introduce new plays, the society specially broadcasted drama programs at the Ministry of Communications Radio Station every Thursday from 6:15 PM to 7:00 PM, in order to reverse the recent decadent trend of general lasciviousness in radio broadcasting. Last week, the drama "Smuggling" was broadcasted, with good results. A few days ago (the 25th), the society originally planned to broadcast Tian Han's new work "Snowy Night" (published in the tenth issue of the ninth volume of the Times). The content of the play is based on the tragic depiction of the lives of all social classes, and set against the eve of the January 28th Shanghai War. The whole play does not have any excessive or offensive descriptions of national relations. Only at the end, the lines "Why don't we go back with guns?" were reviewed and approved by the Ministry of Communications Radio Station. However, after the Experimental Little Theater and the Ant Drama Troupe, it was ordered to stop broadcasting by the Public Works Department. As a result, "Selling" was broadcast temporarily.</p>
<p>"New Wedding Massacre" Scene</p>
<p>Jincheng Screens A Midsummer Night's Dream</p>
<p>The Great Light Theater originally scheduled to screen Mae West's "Belle of the Nineties" today, but due to unexpected special problems, it changed to screen the world blockbuster "A Midsummer Night's Dream." Although the film was once screened at the Cathay, the seat prices were too expensive. Now it is heard that the Great Light will not increase prices when it screens this film. It is a fun thing to watch "A Midsummer Night's Dream" on a midsummer night.</p>

<h3>International Convention on Punishment of Drug Traffickers: US Representative Refuses to Sign, Deeming it a Major Setback for the Anti-Drug Movement; Failure to Address Drug Trafficking in Concessions</h3>
<p>(Geneva) US Representative Fowler declared at the anti-drug conference today that the United States is unwilling to sign the opium convention, as it is a major setback for the global narcotics prohibition movement. Fowler especially criticized the convention's provision authorizing countries to refuse extradition of drug traffickers hiding within their borders, stating that the convention failed to address the extraterritorial regions where drug trafficking is most severe. Representatives from other countries, including the United Kingdom, have already signed the convention. (26th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The international conference on the "Convention on the Punishment of Illicit Drug Trafficking" passed a draft convention yesterday, as reported in a previous dispatch. Now, US Representative Fowler has issued a statement saying that his country is unwilling to sign it because the draft's provisions regarding the extradition of drug traffickers are too lenient, and it fails to stipulate that drug traffickers should be extradited even in countries where extraterritoriality is still in effect.

<h3>China Orders Large Quantities of Rails and Trains from Belgium; Loan of £3 Million</h3>
<p>Beijing Reuters reported today that a certain Chinese railway is currently ordering large quantities of rails and trains from Belgian factories.

The total cost of the goods is £3 million, to be paid in installments over several years, guaranteed by the Chinese government. (26th Reuters)</p>
<h3>Japanese Cabinet Approves Establishment of Information Committee to Address International Situation</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) In order to address the changes in the general international situation after the Manchurian Incident, the government, wishing to implement national policy without regrets, established the Domei News Agency. Furthermore, to achieve close coordination of information within government departments, to ensure thoroughness in carrying out important national affairs, it established the Information Committee. Regarding its functional structure and the establishment of other official systems, a preparatory committee was previously organized, with commissioners being relevant officials from the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Interior, Army, Navy, and other related ministries, to conduct intensive research. A proposal has now been finalized and was approved at the Cabinet meeting on the 26th, with a formal decision made. The official system will be published in the official gazette on July 1st and implemented that same day, announcing the appointed commissioners. However, since the government's policies or the content of its policies have often been misinterpreted at home and abroad, resulting in errors in domestic public opinion or obstacles in diplomatic negotiations, the government will use this committee to strive to eliminate such shortcomings. The committee will be headed by the Chief Cabinet Secretary, with vice-ministers from relevant ministries, the chief of the Legislative Bureau, the chief of the Police Bureau of the Ministry of Interior, the director of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the director of the Intelligence Department of the Army, the director of the Military Affairs Propagation Department of the Navy, and the director of the Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications as members, responsible for practical matters. Furthermore, Hikaru Yokomizo, the current First Cabinet Secretary, has been appointed as the chief executive officer with official rank, and Nagao Kita, the third section chief of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Ryuzo Kawamura, the unpaid section chief of the Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, have been appointed as full-time officers to ensure that the organization can operate effectively and appropriately.

<h3>Germany Implements Barter Trade Policy for Trade with the Far East</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Dr. Knupp led an economic survey group to China, Japan, "Manchukuo," and Siam this spring to study the possibility of importing foreign goods and developing German trade in those areas. Commercial agreements were signed with "Manchukuo" and Siam. It is generally believed that the various regions of the Far East have the potential to become a "second South America" with regard to trade with Germany, that is, importing German goods on the one hand and exporting domestic goods to Germany for exchange on the other. The trade relationship between Germany and China is such. According to recent statistics, Germany's trade with China is second only to that of the United States, and its prospects are virtually limitless. This is not the case in Japan, as Japan can purchase large quantities of German goods, but Germany has no use for Japan's industrial products. The Far East Economic Survey Group therefore recommended increasing the purchase of soybeans from "Manchukuo" and that the German Central Bank and the Yokohama Specie Bank of Japan enter into an agreement stipulating that the Specie Bank advance funds for goods, while the German Central Bank would provide marks to Japan to pay for the German goods imported into "Manchukuo" as a stopgap measure. The agreement concluded by the survey group in Siam stipulates that Germany purchase rubber, resin, and white aluminum from Siam and sell industrial manufactured goods to Siam for compensation.

<h3>More Bloodshed in Palestine; Britain Announces Policy to Fulfill Mandate Responsibility and Protect All Nationalities</h3>
<p>(London) During today's meeting of the House of Commons, a Member of Parliament asked whether the government intended to hand Palestine over to the Jews to build a free and independent Jewish state. Colonial Secretary Gore replied that the government, as the mandatory power for Palestine, has the responsibility to protect the rights of residents of all ethnicities and religions, and the government does not want to implement or support any action that conflicts with the mandatory terms and responsibilities. (25th Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) During today's meeting of the House of Commons, Communist MP Gallacher questioned the government on the Palestine issue, saying, "I don't know if the government intends to change the Palestinian territory into a free and independent Jewish nation-state." Colonial Secretary Ormsby-Gore replied that Britain's entrusted rule over the Palestinian territory and the establishment of such a political system are not within the tasks assumed by Britain, and there are currently no regulations stipulating that the Palestinian territory should belong to either the Arab nation or the Jewish nation. He also said, "Regarding the system in the Palestinian territory, the government does not intend to initiate any action that does not comply with the articles of the mandate system and the responsibilities assumed by Britain. What is the responsibility? That is, Britain should guarantee the inherent rights of all residents of the local area, regardless of their ethnicity or religion." (25th Havas Agency)</p>
<p>(London) The government is now closely watching the situation in Transjordan, fearing that the Bedouin tribes there will revolt to support the Arabs of Palestine. Law and order in Transjordan are currently the responsibility of Sir Herbert Samuel, the British High Commissioner for Palestine. Transjordan's relationship with Palestine has been lukewarm in the past, but now they share the same goal of opposing Jewish encroachment into their territory. According to responsible sources, if an incident occurs in Transjordan, Britain is prepared to do its utmost to deal with it. It is said that about 200 chiefs are currently meeting in Amman to discuss the demand to arm and support the Arabs of Palestine. Although the attitude of Emir Abdullah of Transjordan is not a factor in determining safety, it is very important. The British government currently assists him with administrative expenses of £60,000 per year. However, the main point today is whether he is able to restrain the violent Bedouin people from revolting. People in London now expect that if the Arabs of Transjordan decide to take action, they will not enter Palestine to help the Arabs there. The movement of these people is half due to consecutive years of poor harvests, and the root cause of their unrest is undoubtedly the Jewish encroachment into Palestine. It is now estimated that land in Palestine owned by Jews accounts for one-sixth of the total, but some of it is wasteland, previously rarely cultivated by Arabs. According to Transjordan is ruled by local Arabs, with an Emir and assisted by an executive committee. The area is included within the mandate territory of Palestine. (26th Reuters)</p>

<h3>Sovereignty of Three Small Pacific Islands: Britain to Negotiate with the United States</h3>
<p>(London) The US government has formally designated Baker, Jarvis, and Howland Islands as US colonies. The British government claims that the three islands are all British territories and is considering diplomatic action regarding this encroachment. These three islands are all barren coral formations, formerly managed by the Colonial Office and leased to Australian merchants and shipping companies. According to indirect sources here, the US authorities have used coastal patrol boats from Honolulu to take twelve American students to the three islands, leaving four people on each island. After the American students landed, they raised the American flag on the islands. (25th Reuters)</p>

As the national election matters are related to national plans, there are many concerns that they will be affected by the current situation and postponed. According to reliable sources, all national election matters are currently proceeding as normal. However, it is said that national election matters are complicated, such as citizen oath registration and the various procedures for nominating candidates. It takes a lot of time for official matters to circulate. It is not possible to predict at this time whether it can be completed by October. (26th Central News Agency)</p>
