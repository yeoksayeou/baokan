<p>時評</p>
<h3>德國延長義務兵役年限</h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>本月二十四日。德國表示着願意接受不干涉西班牙內戰協定。但是同時又頒佈命令。把國民義務兵年限從一年延長到二年。因此籠罩在歐洲大陸的戰氛不但未見稍散反而更加濃厚了。</p>
<p>國民義務兵役年限的延長是德國重整軍備的基本政策上一個新的階段。我們要解釋這個問題。不妨把重整軍備的經過來追述一番。從一九一九到一九三三年。德國受了凡爾賽和的的限制。在十二年內。祗許設立九萬六千個職業兵。和四千個軍官。凡有攻擊性的武。都為條約所禁絕。砲台也不許修理而且萊茵地帶還劃設非武裝區城不許軍隊駐紥可是到一九三三年一月。希特勒執政以後。情形就大不相同。整個的德國變了練兵場。所有的軍械工廠也加速製造着殺人利器到一九三五年。它才撕毀了遵守和的的假面具。洩露出眞相來。三月十六日的法案。恢復了一年的强追徵兵制。繼之以勞動服務。五月二十一日的法案。又決定了全國國民都歸軍部管理。結果那年末它已組成了二十四個步兵團三個機械戰鬥　和兩個騎兵團。總數不下四十八萬人。今年三月七日。德國殿棄了非武裝區域的規定。進兵萊茵。本月二十四日。又把去年三月十六日的法案所規定的一年微兵制延長為兩年。據一般入的估計一年以後。德國的陸軍將增加到一百二十萬人。這樣無限制的擴張軍備。必然要使德國的全部工業變成軍械庫。全體民衆變成戰爭機器。原來希特勒統治下的德國。內部包含着許多矛盾。他為了要解决內部的矛盾。鞏固動搖的國社黨政權。實現第三帝國的夢想。自然要積極整理軍備。向國外求發展。所以一有可以藉口的機會。就把軍備的擴張。推進一步。恢復徵兵制的藉口是在法國延長兵役年限。進兵萊茵區域的藉口是在法蘇締結互助恊定。最近延長兵役年限的藉口是在蘇聯提早入伍年齡。這些藉口其實都是有些倒果為因的。</p>
<p>有人說德國旣巳接受了不干涉西班牙內戰的恊定。而又投下這延長兵役年限的巨彈。豈不是前後矛盾了嗎。其實所謂不干涉協定的意義。是在對西班牙交戰雙方。一視同仁的嚴守中立。但是西班牙內戰中。叛軍方面獲得法西斯主義國家的援助。早巳成了公開的事實。現在叛軍方面。得到了大量的接濟。在戰事上巳佔相當的優勢。此次德國藉不干涉之美名。可以隔絕愛好和平者對西班牙政府軍的援助。自然樂得做個順水人情。至于在虛偽的妥協之後。繼之以這火藥氣的巨彈。其用意自然不過是要對世界的和平陣綫威脅一下罷了。</p>

<p>教育新聞</p>
<h3>中央各級教育之新趨向　積極推廣注重實際</h3>
<p>敎部對於各省市今後（二十五年度）實施各級敎育之新趨向、檢查該部已往工作（二十四年度）及將來計劃、（二十五年度）的略述其大要於下、</p>
<p>高等教育</p>
<p>敎部鑒於專科以上學校之畢業生、文法科過剩、實類各科人才不足、為顧全實際需要起見、除限制文法科招生外、並於二十五年度、擴張實類農林醫藥等科、對於西北農林專科學校、已增加經費為六十萬元、以便該校本年度添招新生十三班、並以辛樹幟為校長專任其事、力謀發展、對於籌設國立藥學專科學校、巳經招生、九月間卽在南京鹽業銀行舊址開學上課、此外如整理各省高等敎育經費、隨時派員老核受補助費之私立專科以上學校辦理情形、仍賡續積極進行、至於大學各學院及各種專科學校之課程及設備標準、除醫學院及醫學專科之課程及設備標準、已由敎部組織翳學敎育委員會、在二十四年度內已有製定外、共餘各院校之課程及設備標準、教部現已製有簡表、在本年度內仍分工合作、次第進行、</p>
<p>中等教育</p>
<p>除仍繼續編訂中學各科測騐標準、改善中等學校師資培養辦法外、近來之中等敎育、多趨重職業敎育、對於新的事業已有五十五萬元籌設國立中央工業職業學校已選覓校址（大的在中華門外板橋鎭）先辦土木工程·電機·應用化學·機械等科、的於寒假后招生、對於舊有之職業學校、一面令行延聘農工商各界專家或領袖、組織顧問委員會、以謀訓敎之切合實際、一面以三十萬元為補助中等優良職業學校之用、現在各省市已將優良職業學校呈報敎部、敎部卽將組織委員會、從事審查工作、照敎部上年調查統計、各省市今后所需職業各科師資、的共三千六百數十人、則職業師資之培養、與指導講習會之設立、亦為今后之重要工作、此外關於護士及助產職業學校師資之培養、教部已於二十四年度內設立醫學敎育委員會辦公室、有專任職員、辦理其事、故護士及助產敎育之規劃進行、較前便利、巳多所功效、</p>
<p>初等教育</p>
<p>本年度修正小學規程加人小學敎員、任用待遇保障等條文、减少與其規程重複之處、實為全國小學敎育界一致公認之福音、對於囊務敎育、中央補助各省市之費、四百六十萬元、比較上年度增多、同時令各省市自籌義敎經費、亦須比上年度加倍增籌、並為培養推行義敎師資起見、分別舉辦義敎幹部人員講習班、及義敎師資訓練、講習班巳令各省市選送學員來京講習、定九月二十日開學、訓練班則由各省市集中舉辦、此皆本年度積極推行義務敎育之大慨情形也、</p>
<p>社會教育</p>
<p>本年度社敎之進行除中央以一百一十萬、為民衆敎育電影敎育播音敎宵等之用、並已組織電化敎育人員訓練班、為將來各省市利用電影播音、為施敎工具、又編輯及改善民衆讀物外、對於各省市超過義敎年齡之失學民衆、務期在短期間內、受得補習敎育（公民敎育與識字敎育及自衛訓練）每年每縣市應添民校二十至四十校、每校至少辦兩期、每期的為三個月至六個月、此項計畫、各省市應於九月十五日以前呈部備核、此外如注音漢字字模之推行、繼續計畫中央圖書館及博物館之建築、以及督促各省市推行勞工敎育、（現僅有滬錫有勞較實騐區成立其他各區仍在繼續促進中）情本年度社敎已在辦理、或正在進行　也、</p>
<p>蒙藏教育</p>
<p>在過去蒙藏敎育師資之缺乏、學校數量之少、無可諱言本年度、極力從培養師資、及擴充學校方面、積極進行、故對於蒙藏回苗敎育、已支配經費四十四高八千元、大致訓鍊師資、於綏·寧·甘·靑·新·康·滇·黔·川·湘·等十省分別設立師範校班、或補助原有師範、助其發展、對於察·綏·寧·甘·靑·康·滇·黔·新·湘，川藏·等省、分別擴充小學及附屬小學、此外於邊區推行社會敎育、實施生產敎育補助國內升入專科以上校之學生經費等、皆實事求是、不久可見諸實施也、</p>

<p>新家庭與衛生  沈兆荃醫師主編落伍的靑年怎樣培植健全的頭腦？  DR．BEALE作　沈兆荃譯　　在學生時代的靑年，他們對於頭腦明晰法和記憶力堅强法的渴望，好比飢民的求食；這是像老人的探求不老長壽法—和返老還童法同一心理。　　在靑春時代，生理上因生殖器之內分泌的活動，易起性的煩惱；精神上因知識慾高每好亂讀，因此煩惱更甚。至於考試時的煩惱狀態，那是更加劇烈了！所以現在的靑年學子，差不多有十之七八都感覺神經衰弱的悲哀。　　神經衰弱—是在黑暗中毀滅靑春生活力的惡魔！這病能使前途有為的靑年，一變而為可憐無用之殘身；人生的幸福，　付東流，這是何等可怕的病症。　　腦為神經系統的根源地，由腦部發出的神經纖維，好比如樹枝一樣，散佈到全身各組織各器官，吾人一切之動作，都要由腦頒發命令—由神經作為傳導！而營其全體生存上的生活現象。所以加爾氏說：「人類之本能，情緒，思想，天才，慾念，以及其他道德，智慧，與諸種精神現象，皆以腦為策源地」。由此觀之，腦為人身主宰—換句說話，腦就是我們的生命線。那麼，若要挽救神經的衰弱，就非補給腦部的營養不可！　　　　　　　　照此說來，要想培植健全的頭腦，和驅除毀滅生命力的神經衰弱，惟有常時服用Memory　Neurotic『米美爾補腦汁』，可以使腦力健全，神經强壯，精力旺足，這樣才能得到頭腦明晰，思想靈敏，記憶堅强的效果。除了此種療補法以外，無論吃什麼補劑，是白費辛苦，毫無利益的！現在各國醫師都證明『米美爾補腦汁』有挽救衰弱—培補腦力的權威。并經調查歐美各大醫院診療之報吿，確有數千萬落伍的靑年，服用此藥後，已復得健康，底於成功之境。所以譯出來給我國萎弱落伍的諸位靑年同胞，打開黑暗的生活，謀得美滿的出路！療養肺病不必遠求  沈兆荃醫師　　肺癆病欲求澈底之治療。並不一定要轉地療養。蓋氣候與空氣對肺病非直接的有效。其根本的療法。全在革新生活。即在自宅療養者。若能確實奉行空氣安靜榮養等攝生。及適當之藥劑療法。亦可得完美之效果。　　肺癆病係慢性症候。欲得痊愈。治療期需極長久。費時失業。耗費尤巨。故患者須有支持長期之計畫。方為賢明之方法。倘不甚富裕之病家。如在自宅療養。衹須稍稍更改其居室之構造。（使能適合空氣療法）。注意一般衛生。服用確有特效之『肺活』Phith　Weal（本品可補助生理上自然治療之機能）。其所得結果。有優於轉地療養之好成績。　　在自宅療養者。因其不需大多費用。可以無憂無慮。安然養生。即如飯食與看護等方面。亦以家庭為自由舒適。决非住院或轉地所可及。於是。而在自宅作長期經濟療養。豈不更為安逸。且此法合於大衆生活。無論何人。皆易實行。故肺病之澈底治療。只有自宅療養。可達到目的。不必遠求。　　患者須知在自宅作長期經濟療養。奉行空氣安靜榮養諸療法。服用『肺活』Phith　Weal即為肺病澈底治療之秘訣。若不明斯理。捨近就遠。徒自東奔西走。以為衹須轉地即可治病。實則時時破壞其肺部之病灶的堤防。致使病勢蔓延及於全肺。因轉地反而增劇或喪失其生命者。余屢見不鮮。此蓋由於不知療養法之根本。不知安靜療法之重要。本當仰臥不可勞動。而今反使奔走。舟車勞頓其身體。病安得不進行乎靑年們怎樣保持　生命的資本  章元楨　　啊！不良的惡習轉貫—手淫—正不知造成了天下多少的悲劇！比如一個人有着一蓄水池的寶貴的生命力，而他却在池中到到處鑿洞，讓池中的生命力流盡，我們對於這個人，將作何感想？然而許多人，却正是這般做法，人們有着一大池的生命力，但由於人們的無知，使得大部分的生命力都從漏孔中逃走了！多少有作為有天才的靑年，為着不良的惡習所中傷，以致終身不能酬其壯志，這是多麼可憐呀！　　喜甫霍爾氏說過：『一滴之精液，勝於四十滴之血液』，可知精液之寶貴，比血液還來得重要。霍爾博士謂：『少年之睪丸分泌物（精液），由血液送於心臟，再由心臟輸入各動脈，灌注到筋肉組織，使筋肉强壯，灌注於腦部，使思想靈敏，判斷力健全，意志堅强』可見精液不僅是體力之本，又為智力之源。所以那些荒淫無度的靑年男女，大都是身心萎弱，智力滯鈍，這就是因為浪費了生命資本的精液的原故；如此，簡直殺盡他們自己生命中的種種機會，種種幸福！　　手淫所受之惡影響的結果，大槪是腦神經衰弱—和性的障碍；至於一切的症候和苦痛，實非筆墨所能形容得出來的。　　救治手淫的方法，你必須節制精液的洩費，是更不必說的。不過你已經漏走了的精液，當然也不能够收回來的。只有用强精劑來補救，才可以返弱為强的。依據世界醫者的研究和實驗的結果；這種强精劑，要算德國愛生博士發明的內分泌製劑WELL　TONIC『還爾童』為最有效了。因為本劑係提取雄壯動物睪丸中的內分泌（荷爾蒙）煉製而成。服用之後，能使睪丸造精的機能恢復健全，培養為生命活力的精液，旺盛充足，榮養全體，凡由浪費精液之行為—手淫或房事過度—所誘起的神經衰弱，性的障碍等種種的苦惱與疾病，都能迎刃而解，如白雪之見陽春—迅速消失了。還有一點我是要附帶聲明的，『還爾童』雖富有强精固腎培本補元的特效，但無一些流弊，病者儘可安心服用。决不像普通壯陽害人的那一類欺騙病家的藥品。患淋病的人什麼時候可以結婚　　上海海寗路克能海路口市民療養院　　『洞房花燭夜，金榜掛名時』，這兩名話，寫盡人間的樂事。郞才女貌，在親友道賀聲中，已經舉行結婚儀式了。此後甜密的光陰，眞令人羨慕！不幸甜密的光陰，還未過了幾時，無情的惡魔，好似和陪嫁娘一樣的跟着來了。什麼是惡魔呢？就是新娘受着新郞淋菌（白濁菌）的傳染，發生淋病一切的痛苦，眼見得新娘愁眉蹙額不歡的過着生活。復因着新婚燕爾，羞於啟齒，後來因疾病的嚴重化，才想到醫治，如果用藥得當，還可以過着快活的生活，倘是用藥不當，則淋毒能蔓延到子宮，喇叭管，卵巢等內生殖器各部，變成了慢性，反復的發作，白帶淋漓，并且誘起月經障碍，如月經痛苦，經水過多或過少，以及神經衰弱多種症候。因而令潔白無瑕天眞活潑的新娘，成了一個百病纏身的病婦，美滿的家庭，充滿了不快的境象，你想這是何等樣痛苦的事情呀！　　所以有了淋病的人，到什麼地步，才有結婚的資格？這個問題，實在是現代社會上很重要的一個問題。所以男女當未曾結婚之前，如患有淋病尚未全愈的人（如痛苦雖消，但於尿中仍混有膿球，或淋絲者，亦為淋病尚未斷根之象），須服用切實有效的治淋新藥“918”ANTI—GONO—TAB．『九一八白濁片』并且要耐心用長時日的治療，約經過一月左右之後，將小便送給醫師（或衛生機關）用顯微鏡檢查，不見有淋菌的時候就可以算為確實根治，這樣才有結婚的資格！茲依據各專家實地試騐之結果，都認為“918”ANTI—GONO—TAB．『九一八白濁片』殺菌力强，治愈迅速，安全無弊等優良之功績，確非市間誇言欺人的劣藥可比。女性淋病白帶，同樣服用『九一八白濁片』之外，如已併發月經障碍（痛經，經水或多或少，經期不定，氣血虧損等症）者，須同時加用婦科名藥『美奴寗』MENORRIN內服，調經補血，增加健美，頗有著效。現在是性病潮流澎湃的時候，要保持美滿的家庭幸福，不可不注意這個問題！家庭健康顧問　　本刊為服務社會，保持民衆健康起見。特設顧問部，義務指導衛生及醫藥常識，如有關於本範圍以內之問題，請投函上海愛多亞路馬霍路西首均樂邨六號本刊編輯部，由沈兆荃醫師主答，不受任何費用，來函須詳書姓名住址，并附回信郵資本二外五，空函恕不裁覆。家庭醫藥遺精治療法  李國安醫師　　遺精多由艷夢而起。如春情發動之靑年。難與婦人交接者。或血氣已壯。尚未娶妻者。或在他鄕。不能與妻同衾者。易犯之。其他有因濫行手淫。房事過度而起者。特靑年之人。每以妄起淫念。亂行手淫。釀成此症。其結果至精神衰頽。頭腦暈眩。耳鳴。頭痛。失眠。腰背酸痛。四肢乏力。面容枯瘦。毫無生氣。若不早治。或醫治不當。終至虛弱癆　而亡。　　遺精之療法。必須節制情慾。禁用刺戟性之飲食物。避免身心過勞。止遺藥品。宜服用『福郞』固精片Folan　Tab．於夜間臨睡之前。吞服二至三片。頗有著效。大都衹服一二瓶。即能全愈。對於腎虧所引起之衰弱諸症。當用强精劑。『還爾童』Well　Tonic　有防止衰老，挽救虛弱之權威。痢疾之治療  徐立人醫師　　痢疾一症。於夏秋之時最多。其主要原因。大槪由於飲用不潔之飲料。或食不熟之菓實而起。但皆由患者下痢之大便。為媒介而傳染者。此症初起時。覺全身困倦。食慾不振。腹痛。下痢。裏急後重。每次僅排泄粘液，血液，膿汁等相似之大便少許。急性症則忽起惡寒發熱。腹痛劇甚。大便甚至完全血液。故患者之痛苦。不可形容。若患者治療不當。則能於一二星期內殞命。　　本病之療法。以减食為重要。衹能略用流動液體而富有滋養之食物最宜。對於治療。以『敵腸痢』Uyselrin藥片為本病之特效藥。一日三四次。每次吞服二至三片。大抵於服後二十四小時內。即可見效。腹痛與下痢，均見减輕。粘液血便。亦見稀少。患者覺精神爽快。食慾漸開。寒熱消失。不數日即可吿痊愈。氣喘根治法  王文章醫師　　氣喘，又名痰喘，神經質之人。及罹有慢性氣管枝炎者。均易發生本症。　　本病之症狀。常係突然發病。患者呼吸十分困難。喉間痰聲嘶嗄。面色靑紫。冷汗淋漓。手足厥冷。患者因呼吸困難。故多坐於床上。如如此經過數分鐘至二三小時。始見發作停止。恢復常態。其發作之回數不定。有每月二三次者。亦有頻發者。又有一年中衹發數次者。或平日亦覺呼吸不暢。稍一行動。即感氣急者。大抵身心疲勞過度之時。更易發作。　　療法。從前因無完美之藥物。故皆認為難得根治。往往於發作時。藉麻醉劑（嗎啡鴉片）等暫時緩解其痛苦而已。惟此等麻醉劑不宜常用。因恐有中毒之虞耳。市間販賣之氣喘藥。大多數含有麻醉劑。雖能立刻生效。但有成癮之弊。病家對此等藥品。更須留意焉。　　茲有德國最新發明之氣喘根治特效內服藥『哮立平』Holipin依據各國醫師實騐之結果。對於各種病原之氣喘。均有治愈之可能。用於發作時。大抵十分鐘即得平喘之效。以後在間歇期若續服半打至一打。定能解除復發之苦。且『哮立平』Holipin之藥性平和。其成分中絕無絲毫麻醉劑。故宜久服。不生流弊。是以各國醫師公認本品為根治氣喘之安全內服劑也。女性健美法  過根仙女醫師　　女子的健美。任何人皆知的朕兆是月經。月經若照常的來潮。按期的反復時。大槪其性的機能。不呈何種異常狀態。同時可知其身體也無什麼變化。當然是健美活潑。　　月經正常。就是表示女子身體的健全。若是月經不順。這就是表示女子身體的病弱。所以月經為女子身體健否的測定表。我每見靑年的婦女。顏色蒼白。精神憂　。身體衰弱。一經診察和探詢的結果。十有九人。都是月經發生了異常的緣故。　　月經不調所發的病狀。大槪是月經前後苦痛。出血。和其他種種排泄物。—白帶—下腹和腰部大多數感覺脹痛。以外頭痛。不眠。肩酸。心跳。飲食不振。嘔氣。便秘。小便過多。當時也有帶着疼痛。此外也有頭暈。疲勞。麻痺。浮腫。感覺腫脹。全身怠惰。性感軟弱的。性交時疼痛。因人而不同。這些病症的容態。由患者自身的陳述。可以知道實是不少數。　　靑年婦女罹患月經病的悲慘狀態。眞是苦不堪言。破壞夫婦的美夢。引起家庭的不和。因為精神的苦悶。將靑春健美的幸福。完全銷蝕在這個月經痛苦之中。是何等可惜。那末。月經的障碍。須及早施以適當療法。且要注意攝生。切不可輕視忽略的。　　患者須使精神安靜。避免一切的刺戟。修養身心。絕對的不可過勞。倘是血虧的關係。必須多食滋養物。或服用「康氏生活素」滋補血液。使體力迅速恢復。　　調經的藥劑。在臨床上最有效果者。為「美奴寗」Menorrin此係各國專門醫師所一致推獎的。著者近年來對於婦人科的疾病—月經不調—赤白帶下—等症。均用本品治療。確有美滿之成績。婦女一切痛苦。都得於極短期內雲消霧散。還復健美之樂。贈書　　敝社編印（肺病家庭療養常識）及（男性生殖器機能障碍秘密新療法）各一册均為現代歐美著名醫學博士性病及肺病各專家執筆根據平素之臨床經騐或心得所著文字通俗為靑年衛生不可或缺之讀物也。　　　函案衹須附郵二分—面索不取分文　　上海英租界愛多亞路馬霍路西首均樂邨六號本刊編輯部啓　(來函須註索書二字不誤）</p>

<p>申報文藝專刊光棍婆  劉明　　談到什麽事情，總很逞能的，倘若嘲笑她，說她經不起一記拳頭，那　就會把滯俏的小眼睛一稜，「你去打聽打聽看，人家一二十個趕馬人，氣普普的，又高又大，也把我沒奈何嘿　」　　這人便是光棍婆。　　人們在背後，老是光棍婆這樣，光棍婆那樣的，可是，常着面，卽使上了年紀的人，也得呌她一聲嫂子。因為她，人很能幹，潑辣。嘴巴麽，會駡人，會嘲弄人，也會恭維人。至於身裁却是瘦瘦的，顯得十分單薄。而且兩隻足，那才包得小呢。無怪一般初見她的，總要暗自吃驚，「呵，就是她麽？眞是看不出來哩！」　　她沒有家，沒有丈夫，也沒有兒女，恰如人家暗地呌的，一條光棍，不帶枝葉的樹子樣。據旁人講，先前的時候，山頭，離瑣，擺夷，老緬子，以及好些漢人，她都嫁過，但大都不到半年，便分開了，或者不如說，她逃走了。假如要逼問她的原由，她便說：「男子漢麼，他比你强，本事大，他就要擺丈夫的架子，糟蹋你，使你好不憂氣。他比你還不如呢，那又使人看不入眼，事事招你駡她，率性一個人過活的好，落得天不管，地不收的。你想，兩個人擠在一塊，你不憂他，他就憂你，呸，這樣子何苦來呢？」　　她單人獨馬過日子時，開始是拿鹽和鴉片烟，冒充懷胎的大肚子，混過緝私和巡查的眼睛。隨後，便在三不管的夷人地方，　在檳台後面做老板，利用女人吸客的方便，竟將男子們開設的烟館，冷落下來。我遇見她的時候，她巳經放棄那些苦的經營，却閒在各處客店裏，同偷馬賊，私烟販子，以及外國的緝私人員，幹着坐地分肥的淸閒職務了。　　她常常引為驕傲的，說是把一二十個趕馬人氣得鼓眼睛，那便是在野人山脚一個小市果的時候。趕馬人的一個，曾經當塲受過氣的，就吿訴過我。「那一次，眞倒霉。剛走進擺夷店，卸下馬鞍子，吹，巡查員一大夥兒，外國人，通來了。往回都不要緊，由他查，我們啣着烟袋，說笑着，採都不受睬的。這回一大包鴉片，怎麽辦呢？丟麼？沒地方。大家都急得來，靑了臉子。你知道，坐半年六個月痛，（緬語，指鹽獄）我們是滿不在乎，怕打失的就是錢呀，那統是我們一滴一滴的汗掙出來的。幸好事情凑巧。你猜碰着那一個，就是光棍婆。她開的房間，正挨近馬塲，一眼看出我們慌的是什麼，便駡道：「糊塗東西，怎麽不交跟代！……我替你們檢着，看哪個敢搜查？」一把就抓了過去，這眞像活觀音下凡，平白地打救了我們。……嚇，她的本事眞不小，要不是她，那一天，事情也出了岔子。你看見，她剛藏好出來，外國人便走過來了，先不檢查，就指着她問道：「你剛才傘的什麼東西？」「什麽東西？這才問得怪了！」她臉色一點也不變，只要笑嘻嘻，假裝生氣的樣子，「你想當麽？一口袋柿餅哪，他們剛從漢朝地方帶結我的。」設着，眞的把我們那個。袋拿出來了，董的一聲丟在地上。這倒嚇得我們一大跳。萬一檢查，豈不精糕了？可是野入扁達（緬語巡查員）提起口袋，兜底一倒，你猜那是什麽？吹，全是柿餅呀，一點也不哄人。這婆娘，手足眞快極了，一轉身，什麽都做停當了，比要把戲的，還高明。等會檢查的走了，我們一大夥自就凑錢買些牛奶餅乾罐頭去送她，你曉得，白請人帮忙，我們是做不出來的。哪知她才不理我們，也不收禮物，只躺在床上，翹起兩隻要命的尖尖足。還說，「見你們的鬼，誰看見你們的鴉片烟。」我們一聽見這樣說，眞像屋頂忽然蹋下來，壓港腦頂門一樣，大家都說不出話來，一二十個漢子，只是你望着我，我望着你的。要是在漢朝地方，依我們趕馬人的脾氣，早就把她抓下床來，打得稀爛。你知道，我們這一夥兒人，都是揍老婆的能手哪。可是在這里，我們只得向她說好話，朝着她的臭小足，彎腰又屆膝的。因為，事情鬧穿不得，外邊就有着扁達。並且，眞的同她翻了臉，以後一路，就不好做生意。……眞不曉得，一二十個人，輪流向她陪了多少小心，她才坐了起來，答允我們的請求，一面却仍然板起面孔敎訓我們，說我們以前販私烟，全不招呼她一聲，毫沒江湖上的義氣。……媽的，拆穿說，就是要孝敬她呀……我們肚子里想，這婊子多可惡，有朝一日，碰着巧，我們可要倒提起一隻手揑一隻尖尖足，撕開你的跨哪。但嘴巴子呢，都連聲應「是」，還外加幾個「不敢」「不敢」哩。聽了半天敎訓，你以為地原封原樣退給我們嗎？她才摸出紙票來了，開始笑嘻嘻地說道：「好，看在老朋友面上，就照本錢退給我吧！」吹，天王爺，漢朝地方和外國地方，價錢是天差地差的哪，白白賺了我們幾十，還看在老朋友面上。媽的，這婊子。我們拿着幾張紙票出來，個個人肚子都要氣炸了。那往後幾天我告訴你，那百來匹馬，眞不曉得吃了多少鞭子。」　　說到這里，連他自己也跟我笑了起來，一面重新把熄了的烟袋點燃，叭了幾口之後，又像感歎，又似吿誡地說道：　　「踫着光棍婆是該小心的，一個不留意，她的光棍就打在你的身上了。」　　她到我們店里時，只要遇着老板和老板娘在吵架，她總是半開玩笑，半似認眞地從恿。　　「老板娘，你吵什麽呢？跟你老板打一架呀，你體子那們好，一下就把他按翻了。只消一頓收拾，管呌他服服帖帖，要跪就不敢站的。　　「你好人！」老板也半開玩笑半似認眞地回答「簡直敎老婆造反起來了。我不答允你的！」　　「這算得造反麽？要是眞的造反，我吿訴你，先就要把你們男子漢，足緾得小小，比我的還要小三分。」　　光棍婆得意地伸一伸她的小足。　　「那他們這些女人不會餓死麽？我們男子，足都纏來動不得！」　　老板只指着老板娘說，不敢把光棍婆包括在內。　　「那笑話，你想想看，我們女人都有本事緾你們足的時侯，請問還會餓飯嗎？」　　「你就是一張嘴巴厲害」　　聽見老板有點鄙薄她，於是她便把帶俏的小眼睛一稜，照例又舉出她曾經氣一二十僩趕馬人的事了。淞濱感舊  楚陽　　我曾經在吳淞的砲台灣度過兩　夏天和一個下半年，那不獨是我領受得太短促的優越的大學生活時期，而且是充滿着靑春的夢幻與情熱，詩與羅曼斯，永遠値得追懷的日子。這是現實人生中最缺少的日子，在我的生涯中又是何等轉瞬易逝的啊！　　當我在社會的戰塲上負了創，眼看着北國的山河在瀰漫的黑雲籠罩裏漸漸變了色，我帶着幾乎是「永別」的悲哀黯然離開了曾共死生患難的古城，經過了風雪連天巨浪怒吼的數晝夜的海上的漂泊，我重又南返了。那是去年冬天的一個午間，我從暈睡的艙底爬出來，迎接我別了五年的吳淞口：烟雨濛濛中，港口石磯盡處的那燈塔似乎隱隱在閃着紅光—其實這不過是我的幻覺，那燈亮是要對着夜海才閃眼的—，海灣上的要塞處，依舊綠林深掩，看不出什麽痕迹，可是內裏呵，恐怕已經是廢鐵縱橫，空染着戰士斑斑血蹟！觸動着我最深，使得我要從心哭出來的是：驀然眺望見車站那邊，昔日那座「萬綠叢中一點紅」的大學建築，我已經看不見那深紅色的巍峨的前世紀風格的學院式大樓，祇有燒焦了的轟殘了的那鐘樓的半壁轟立在叢林之中，你睜大了的眼睛，它便投入你的眼簾，那好像一隻巨大古銅色的手掌—我想起那些保衛國土的民族英維的巨手來—向你仲舉，向你呼號。　　這樣的一種痛惜的追悼的情緒把我引進了黃浦，我默然踏上了一行列的巨艦拱衛着的上海的岸。我也鑲了這樣痛惜追悼的情緒，到了上海後，我特地去重尋我舊日的不可磨滅的足跡。我那天是和曾在中公任敎職的丹女士一同去的。所以在這裏，也是她「熱情的沉痛」的寄託所與徘徊地。我們在一種懷舊的渴望中和誠樸的黃包車夫攀談，深深留下在他們心坎的對凶殘的暴力的憤恨，像一根火柴似地把火引了起來，不可熄滅的燃燒！他們把我們拖拉在一條被野草掩沒的破碎了的石子路上，這便是昔日朝朝熱鬧的夾道的一條大學街，祇零洛地剩下幾所住着本地的貧窮的村民的破屋，那許多飯館，賣鮮菓和點心的店子，咖啡和冷飮舖子，書店，服用品商行，都不知到何處去了？赤足裸身的孩子和聳着小辮子穿身汚爛的衣裳的小姑娘立在他們破敗的門前，睜大他們稀異的眼釘住道兩位輕易不常見的貴客，他們張開着嘴好像欲吿訴我們：天上的鐵鳥怎麼生下蛋來，落在那好看的大學大樓上，發出大雷一般的巨響，冒出黑烟，那座樓便坍倒了！今日我從他們的神情上還可讀出那充滿了他們小小的生命上的驚奇啊。車夫好容易開出一條道來把我們帶到凋殘了幽黯了的紅色的大門前，我們還熟識它是「我們的大學」的莊嚴的大門哩！我們進進出出踏過幾千幾百回的門前的橋座為幾根燒焦了的樑本所替代，我不知丹女士的感覺怎麼樣，我走過去時好像全身要陷落下去，陷落在那已經乾涸的河溝的汚泥裏，雖然那墊脚的樑木卽是燒掉了皮肉它的骨頭確仍是堅實的。　　一個六七十歲的湖南老頭子不待我們做聲打開了鐵柵的大門，那銹汚了的鐵柵上却懸着一塊「謝絕參觀」的木牌。他並不是門房「老吳」那老頭子，我不認識他，他也不認識我，他是這廢墟的守者，問他時他吿訴我「老吳」那老頭子死了！「老蔡」呢？「老蔡的家庭住在這裏」，他指着校門外不遠那座僅存的完好的瓦房，我這時回頭看見一個高身材的中年婦人呆立在那里望着我們好像回思什麼似地，那便是老蔡的女人，據說老蔡仍在學校裏，但學校在何處呢？我祗知道這裏纔是「我們的大學」啊！　　一進一大門，盡是荒　　革，斷壁殘坦，滿目荒凉，滿目荒凉！一種沉重的「般滅的悲哀」打痛我的心，我看見丹女士也是一付慘然的面容。有什麽比這種人類自己毀滅的戰爭更傷心慘怛的破壞喲！除了世界上最野　的强盜還有人要用砲火來毀滅一座文化的Forum一個尊高的大學的麽？　　無可比擬的野蠻和殘酷，也是無可比擬悲痛和仇恨，導引我們去爬過被戰爭的足跡埋沒了我們的足跡的母校的處處，我們把持着顫懍的心串過一座座為毀滅的精靈遺棄在那裏的房屋：雄美的大樓揭去了屋頂和樓面，空虛的窗和門危危欲墜地立着，地下是碎了的磚堆和燒殘了的木頭，過了四年的風吹雨淋夜露日晒，刺鼻的火藥氣和到處堵塞你的呼吸的一種破敗味包圍着我們。科學館還保留着一個較完整的外壳。風雨操塲橫躺着燒斷了的几枝大樑柱。大禮堂祗剩下一個屋基了。　　—你看那稞大樹成了枯枝椏了！從前這裏不是有許多長得很好看的梧桐樹的麽？　　當我們走過還存留着的一帶由大樓通後面宿舍的走廊的時候，丹女士那麽慨嘆地感念着。兩邊的廊予中間的庭園裏長滿了開着白色小花的蓬蒿，雜着一些野生植物，也還有幾棵低短的權木樹和一株兩株高洋梧站在這很不愉快的塲面裏，丹女士忽然又發現一校獨放異彩的喇叭形的紅花，還把它摘下來要帶回去作紀念物，我說：—這是染了我們民挨的血的戰地之花呀！　　丹女士瞻仰了這校舍的四周的遺址，用她那種詩人唱着憶歌的調子和我描述這已經毀滅的校舍：它的結搆，配置，色調，和四周的風景，新鮮的空氣，搆成整體的美麗，簡直是美學上的典型的建築物。她的讚美使我更追迴於這里的自然，人物不置！在道個富於自然的美麗，海一樣的容量，空氣一樣的自由的大學裏，過去在這裏逗留過的成千成萬的靑年人間，有多少活躍　在我腦裏的各樣彩色各樣特長成長在時代思潮的核心的人物，想起他們現在已經散佈到全中國的動脈裏去了，也有的為民族的災難犧牲了吧？我的感慨也就越多了。　　我們還去看了「新宿舍」建築了這座巨大的三層樓房子的老校長，當時花了不少心血與氣力來經營的，造成後却傳佈一種惡毒的謠言於學生羣裏，說這座房子建築不强固要倒坍下來的，兩三年後却好比那謠言更惡毒的硫磺彈轟炸得倒坍下來了！不獨那老校長來此看了要「老淚縱橫」，便是我這個在這里祇住了半年就被趕走了的學生也要「淚溫靑衫袖」喲。　　新宿舍前的大操塲長滿了深可沒膝的野草，東邊角上那兩座鵝黃色的帶有露台的小洋房，是曾有無數大學男生傾倒在她的脚下的被稱為「東宮」的女生宿含，他們還姊妹似立在這荒凉的戰塲的一角，承受這廢墟的風光，一個竟依然無恙地美好如舊，一個也僅祇帶了些憔悴的創傷的形態。丹女士曾在那里住過所以對它特別神往，祗是連走的路都沒有了，她也就僅止投了最後的一瞥，從一條女貞樹長過了人頭的夾道，我們尋出了校門，守門的老頭子親熱地和我們談話，送了我們出來，希望還在他的心中，他希望這大學仍舊能够要復興起來！　　校門外的門房老蔡的女人仍是用她哼哼的鼻子說話，她認得出我是「×先生」了：—×先生，我還認得你，到家裏來坐坐喝一杯茶！　　天却洒下幾點雨，好像替我們洒下憑吊之淚。我們匆匆地走了，留下寂寞的廢墟，寂寞的老年守者，寂寞的老年女人。呌艇吧  斐兒　　『呌艇吧？』　　『呌艇吧？』　　在廣州，珠江住着水上的民族。當汽輪橫衝過江上，水上的都市却依然在江面飄蕩。在炎陽下，艇仔以狹小的蓬蓋遮蔽着客人；當江面佈滿了雨絲，雨點却打入了蓬

朋友問他得話：　　「擬要不要呌俞小姐來看你一次，如果要，我可以以朋友的力量來帮你一下忙。」　　當時他曾經怎樣回答已記不清了，此時他却流起淚來，等淚珠流到了他的臉上，他像突然一跳，又開始懺悔起來：「讓過去的過去吧，病好了之後，我得好好地振作起來！」　　於是他又溫習了朋友們給他的溫暖的友情，對這些友情？他不知道應該怎樣來表示答謝，他祗是概念地在心底裏呌，朋友們待我太好了，待我太好了。他因之希望更多的朋友來看他，就卽使痛駡他一頓，他也願意接受，像這樣寂寞得像墳墓似的病室，他實在受不了了。　　過度的興奮使他的臉上又發起燒來，他摸了摸自己微燙的臉頰，禁不了又感傷起來，支撑着走到鏡子面前，鏡子吿訴他的却是一個瘦得可怕的影子，顴骨凸起着，眼珠却凹了下去，他感到有一股熱從心底湧了起來，眼珠也感到一陣潤濕，他搖了搖頭，輕輕地嘆息了一句：「怎麽這般沒中用」，便走到窗前去，想從窗口中得一些風，散散他的悶熱。　　從窗口望出去，可以看得見一片綠得可愛的草坪，因為時間正中午，所以院子裏找不出一個人影，祗讓溫暖的太陽明朗地照着整個院子。　　由於草坪，他病中敏銳的神經連想起別的有草坪的所在，也連帶地想起了游泳池，在那些地方，他是會經替她們留下不少的影子的，而現在，他所有的却也祗有那些底片了。　　他顫巍巍地又回到了床上，竭力地把衝動的情感壓低下去，他這時候希望有一位朋友來看他，他可以倒在朋友的懷中，痛快地哭一頓，談後，訴說他不止一次的懺悔。　　但是，房中除了白色的傢具和白色的被單之外，祗有他這一個形同骷髏的生物。　　好容易盼到門開了，進來的却是醫生，醫生診視他的結果，用慈和的聲音對他說：「你應該好好地休養，不要再胡思亂想了，你看，你的興奮又使你的體溫增高了。」　　他無力地低低頭。終於，掙扎着用最大的勇武說：「我的病究竟有沒有好的希望呢？」　　醫生用慈和的聲音回答他，「你不要望壞的地方想，你的病不是挺壞的，好好地休養一時，你便會好起來。最要緊的是你不要把痛苦給自已嚐。」　　他用感激的微笑來答謝醫生，對於他自己，也像添了一股力：他要好好地活下去，並且要使自己活得有意義些。　　醫生走出了他的房門，由於入類同情心的驅使，却禁不住微微嘆息了起來：左右的肺葉差不多都將爛盡了，　他還想活下去，可憐的人呵！笛  寥楚咻　　秋天了。是的，秋天了。那末，就寫一點秋的文章罷。，於第一件東西，隨着秋天，浮上心頭的是「笛」；是一管並不出奇的笛。　　笛是胡樂，這大概不錯。唐初是胡樂流入中國最多的時代，而笛的傳入，却遠在唐前，岑參謀一胡琴琵琶與羗笛」列舉了二樣胡樂，羗自然是當時的一個外國了。李白詩「黃鶴樓中吹玉笛，」「誰家玉笛暗飛聲，東風入洛散滿城，」開元之際，笛之一物，大概已經普遍流行於中國了。　　唐人說部載長安人李謨善吹笛，曾於明月夜在宮牆外偷聽梨園子弟的名曲「霓裳羽衣」，用指偷刻工商，以笛譜之，妙絕一時。這件事曾經引起我若干冥想，凉月一天，宮牆十里，一個白挾少年，携着長笛，獨坐在御溝的石橋邊，側耳遙聽，細按工商，到譜完後，忽然長笛一聲，淸久雲表，月光瀉地，萬籟無聲，卽是宮禁的梨園子弟，也因為特然飛來淸怨的笛聲而停歌漫拍，而側帽凝神，而潛然淚下！　　宋徵明詩：「長笛何人夜倚樓」，笛和高樓幾乎成了不能分開的東西，因為樓高笛聲飛得更遠，因為樓高笛聲顯得更淸，當然高樓長笛，也只有在高遠的秋宵，才能盡他的「淸怨」之妙。　　簫和笛同樣是竹製，樂器中普遍的東西。但是簫的和婉終不如笛的激越，畢竟要我不作左右袒，那末吹簫是宜於春月溶溶的深院，而吹笛宜於秋月皎皎的危樓罷。古人形容歌聲，往往用「穿雲裂石」四字，我以為拿來形容長笛是更適當的。筆記上往往有「笛裂」之說，這雖則不一定是事實，但是笛聲到了極激越的時候，實在使我們不自主的起着這樣的感覺。　　較之一切樂器，笛所具有悲哀成多，是必然的。因為他的起源就在游的西北民族，在平沙無限的大漠上，淡白德沙礫，給北國的皎潔的月光，照成了銀色，無數白雲似的羊羣靜靜的眠着，一個穿着重裘的少年，忽然想到在那很遠很遠的另一個有水草的地方，有一個生着會說話的眼睛的人，同時他又想到在去年就在現在坐的地方，曾經騎着駿馬，携着射雕，弓弩，和那批志在封侯的漢家飛將，縱橫血戰，一個沉雄正直的父親，和英姿煥發的哥哥，都把他們的血喂着脚下的沙礫，而他們的更多的羊羣，也成了漢軍的美食，於是他就把身邊倚着的長笛吹起來，他滿擬借着笛聲吹散自己的悲哀，那知他的悲哀就化作笛聲飛起，從淸幽而凄凉，凄凉而激越，原來他是一個不肯流淚的人啊！　　對於音樂我是一個低能者，但是因為愛好，居然也能夠吹吹笛，後來因為對於崑腔的愛好，就更認眞的吹起來，自然住在上海這樣的都市中，我是就有笛也不敢吹的，因為我有一個奇怪的脾氣，一吹起就不知道停，一定要吹得充滿着眼睛中的眼淚不住的流下來，氣咽得再不成音，方才擱下，而所吹的又不一定是一隻曲子，往往吹了幾句「山坡羊」，接着又是「駐飛雲」，接着又是渾江龍」，這給專門聽聽「桃花江」「花弄影」的人聽到不是大殺風景嗎？　　我有一枝長笛，我想携着牠到一個大漠上儘情的吹一吹，吹給白雲，吹給藍天，吹給我自己聽！啓事　　投稿諸君鑒：退還稿伴務須於原信內附足郵票並詳細通訊地址，如以後補寄郵票，恕不答覆。　增刋編輯室啟無綫電歌曲介紹　　夜戰商　　月光皎皎，慘被彈烟籠軍，黑夜漫漫，祇覺寒風抖哨，風聲緊，砲聲高，槍聲急，一陣陣齊吹到，戰壕積水，如海添潮，沒冷了我的征袍，浸冷氏我的麵包，沒冷了我的一切，但是我的心，我的血，始終像沸湯一般熱，烈火般燒，戰塲生活，勞苦當熬，上好了我的槍彈，上好了我的刺刀，逕往前把敵人掃，任聽我的身，我的魂，往前去，頓時散裂，片刻勾銷，往前去，往前去，若得不到生存的勝利，便得着了死的墳地，死啊，生啊，怎能知道，生啊，死啊，誰能預料，生和死不是我的目標，我的使命是護衛我的民國，我的賣任是保障我的同胞。特別節目　　雅嗚社　　交通（一三〇〇）下午五時三刻至六時半　　醉臥沙塲　（沈瑛）　　義勇軍進行曲　（柴瑟）　　離別了姑娘　（沈玲）　　迷途的羔羊　（沈瑛）　　好朋友來了　（沈玲）　　南海美人　（沈瑛）　　靑年的時髦　（沈瑛）（柴瑟）　　月光藝社　　亞東（七六〇）下午九時零玉分　　（一）前奏曲　（二）賣花女　　（三）爸爸倘若你愛我　（四）告別南洋　　（五）小天使　（六）牢吟曲　　（七）狂歡曲　（八）春之花　　（九）靑春之樂　（十）睡的贊美　　（十一）迷途的羔羊　（十二）蝴蝶姑娘　　（十三）飄泊者　　（十四）後奏曲　　歡迎各界點唱電話三七六二六號彈詞　　中西（一〇四〇）下午一時至一時三刻　　開篇「瀟湘問病」　　荼茫暮色漸黃昏。颯颯微風細雨涔。暗淡瀟湘聲寂寂。凄凉瘦竹影沉沉。怡紅公子多情種。想起了多愁多病人。　笠簔衣穿帶好。持燈急急走園林。行來巳到瀟湘館。姑娘是，作罷詩章纔擱筆。丫環忽報二爺臨。只見他，今朝打扮非往昔。寳哥哥，何事救學漁翁形。公子聞言忙相間。妹妹身處可安甯。藥可吃。飯可增，近日不分明。妹妹若愛此裝束。緩日卽當送一身。顰卿回言何需此。漁婆形像實無名。話出口。暗思忖。漁翁漁婆不該云。桃花面泛羞難掩。默默低頭不作聲。一個是，無意言語偏說錯，一個是，未聞情寶豈知情。紅樓一夢多變幻。聯表那，問病瀟湘一段姻。恨月老不牽情絲綫。故使醫藥總無靈，徒負雙雙一片心。　　何芸芳何琴芳雙珠球　　麟記（一二二〇）下午二時一刻至三時　　開篇「牡丹」　　牲丹花國獨稱王。它那時，綠葉紅花景色揚。富貴獨標奇品類。位居領袖帥羣芳。花神二月花朝夕。譜出嬌顏異種良。曾記得。淸室苛求文字獄。那一詩異稱亦稱王。頓時掀起無邊禍。多少書生為此亡。可憐那，死後還須屍暴露。不敎白骨葬墟荒。而今國事蜩塘裏。昔日文豪誰憶將。吳梅村，逞詩在。冲冠一怒為紅妝。到後來，滇王三桂把千金買。未許將詩刪去藏。所以那，淸室昏君把大獄猖。一紙通行興文字獄。株連多少好先生。憐他屍</p>

<p>(Jiujiang) From Kuling, President Jiang and Vice President Kong telegraphed Chairman Liu of Sichuan Province on the 26th, stating that it was reported that at 4:00 PM on the 24th, rioters in Chengdu rioted, gathering thousands of people, destroying shops, and killing two Japanese reporters, injuring two. One said that two Japanese were seriously injured, one was missing, and one was safely out of danger. Another said that only one Japanese person died. The crowd dispersed at 8:00 AM yesterday morning after the military police opened fire. Chongqing and Chengdu are on alert. We have not received a telegram from the provincial government and do not know the truth. Please investigate the details and telegraph them quickly. On the one hand, persuade those foreigners who do not have legal passports to be sent out of the country. Those who have passports and have lived in Sichuan Province should be given extra protection.

(Special dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today's newspaper editorials unanimously commented on the Chengdu incident. The Nichi Nichi Shimbun said that this matter cannot be resolved with diplomatic documents such as Taoism, security, preventing the recurrence of similar incidents, and punishing responsible personnel. If the National Government authorities are willing to take full responsibility and consider the general situation to start adjusting Sino-Japanese relations, then it may be possible to turn misfortune into blessing. On the contrary, if they stick to their traditional policies in this difficult situation and cannot pull themselves together, then the inevitable occurrence of future unfortunate incidents is inevitable. The Asahi Shimbun said that the Chengdu incident has made Sino-Japanese relations more complicated. Both sides should regard it as a great regret. It is reported that this incident was incited by the Communist Party to trap the National Government in a difficult situation. Although it is true that the Communist Party in Sichuan Province is gradually being suppressed, the Communist Party can still cause disturbances in the provincial capital, the rear of the government army. In any case, the Chinese authorities should take responsibility. We should investigate the cause of this incident, but the Japanese government must also explore the main reasons why Japanese residents in China are often attacked. The Yomiuri Shimbun advised the Japanese government to take this opportunity to abandon its past crude methods of resolving matters and insist on re-establishing a consulate in Chengdu. The newspaper also said that it is essential to guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again, otherwise the adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations is hopeless. The Jiji Shinpo said that Sino-Japanese relations are now entering a new stage. The past gloom between the two countries is expected to be cleared up, but the unfortunate incident in Chengdu is a great regret. If this incident can be the key to China's fundamental abandonment of its anti-Japanese attitude, then it is not difficult to turn misfortune into blessing. There are several points about Japan's attitude towards China that we urgently need to reflect on and pay attention to, and we must not take any useless actions that incite the feelings of the Chinese. The Chugai Commercial News said that the most important prerequisite for adjusting Sino-Japanese relations is to completely eliminate the anti-Japanese movement. The only way to create a bright future is to ask the National Government to completely ban the anti-Japanese movement that is now spreading throughout China. This is a test of the adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<h3>The Bodies of Watanabe and Fukakawa Have Been Found</h3>
<p>During the riot on the 24th, four Japanese people were also beaten by rioters in the chaos. Two of them were rescued by the military police, and the other two were said to have died from serious injuries or were missing, and it was impossible to find out for a while. After the event, when the bodies were examined, two bodies were found, and no one claimed them. The local authorities suspected that they were Japanese. Shibo Yoshi, a former member of the Japanese Consulate in Chongqing, also flew to Chengdu. It was confirmed that the two bodies were indeed Watanabe and Fukakawa. The fact that two Japanese people died from serious injuries was thus confirmed. Wu Zehu, the special envoy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stationed in Sichuan and Kang, telegraphed Taniya Ryohei, the Japanese consul in Chongqing, on the 27th, informing him of this matter and entrusting him to convey condolences to the families of the deceased. The original telegram reads as follows: It was found that two unclaimed bodies were found during the incident on the 24th, and after being identified by Mr. Shibo, it was confirmed that they were Mr. Watanabe and Mr. Fukakawa. I am extremely shocked that such an unfortunate event occurred when Sino-Japanese friendship is good. I would like to express my regret and sincerely mourn.

<h3>Itagaki Seishiro Arrives in Tianjin; Commanders' Meeting to Be Held Today; Wachi to Visit Taiyuan</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Chief of Staff Itagaki, accompanied by Second Section Chief Muto and Adjutant Izumi, flew from Beijing to Tianjin by military plane at 4:30 PM on the 27th, landing at the Dongjie Juzi Airport. Tianjin Japanese Chief of Staff Hashimoto, along with staff officers such as Tonda Asai and Ikeda, welcomed him at the airport and immediately accompanied him to the Furongkan in the Japanese Concession for rest. After meeting with Japanese reporters, he visited Commander Tshiro's residence at Zhang Garden at 5:00 PM for talks. Hashimoto was also present. He returned to his residence at 6:00 PM. It was decided that at 10:00 AM on the 28th, he and Tshiro Hashimoto will convene a meeting of senior commanders of the Kwantung and North China Armies. Staff members of the Tianjin Army Department, as well as Section Chief Muto, Adjutant Izumi, and Fuku Yubutsuki, will attend. At 9:30 AM on the 29th, he will still fly back to Changchun by military plane. (Special dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Itagaki said that his trip to Suiyuan to meet with Fu Zuoyi was for investigative purposes. He did not meet with any important figures of the Hebei-Chahar Council after arriving in Beijing. He will stay in Tianjin for one or two days before flying back to Changchun. The Kwantung Army Department believes that the situation in North China is serious and that it is necessary to consult with the North China garrison to find a response. In the past, the Kwantung Army Department had been laissez-faire towards the North China incident. Now, they feel that the timing is critical and that they must re-define their methods in order to take appropriate measures. The Sui East incident is naturally within this scope, but how to deal with it is still uncertain. He will convene a meeting with Commander Tshiro tomorrow. If anyone considers this to be an important meeting, then they can only listen to it. (Special dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Wachi, a staff officer of the Japanese garrison in North China, changed his itinerary after being ordered to visit Itagaki in Beijing on the night of the 26th and went to Taiyuan to visit Yan Xishan for important negotiations.

<p>(Beiping) Liu Ruming said that the truth of the Sui East incident is unclear, but bandits in Shangdu are quite active. Chahar and Suiyuan are interdependent, and the garrison stationed on the border of Chahar has been ordered to cooperate in defense. (Special dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Zhang Zizhong hosted a banquet for Tshiro, Itagaki, Hashimoto, and the staff of the two armies at the official residence of Beining Road at 7:00 PM on the 27th. (Special dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Kwantung Army Chief of Staff General Itagaki returned to Beiping from Suiyuan today. According to an interview with a newspaper reporter, the Kwantung Army does not want to take any action in Inner Mongolia in the near future, and he never dreamed of it. Itagaki also denied the rumor that Japanese troops were stationed in Zhangbei, saying that there were only three or four Japanese instructors at the Mongolian military school there, which is an ordinary school that also offers military courses. He meant that the participants in the recent war in Suiyuan were bandits. Those bandits launched an attack for the first time, were defeated by the Sui army, and then launched an attack again, and were completely repelled by the Chahar army. When asked by the reporter if he had detected any attitude towards Fu Zuoyi, Itagaki smiled and replied no. (Reuters dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At the meeting at Zhang Garden's official residence on the 28th, Itagaki plans to propose: (1) The North China regime issue, (2) The North China economic issue, (3) The Sino-Japanese diplomatic adjustment issue, (4) The Suiyuan incident, (5) The Kwantung Army Department's full assistance to various overseas agencies in China to strengthen political affairs. Itagaki will submit the draft resolution of the Kwantung Army Department on the spot for discussion and exchange of views. (Special dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Two strange airplanes flew east over Tangshan late at night at 10:00 PM and 11:00 PM on the 25th. (Special dispatch on the 27th)</p>

The director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office was summoned to meet Itagaki. The Kwantung Army Department is strongly supporting the Hebei-East organization. After inspecting it, Itagaki said that he was very impressed and would intercede with Tshiro Hashimoto to maintain its existence. (Special dispatch on the 27th)</p>

<h3>Germany Extends Compulsory Military Service</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>On the 24th of this month, Germany expressed its willingness to accept the non-interference agreement in the Spanish Civil War. However, at the same time, it issued an order to extend the national compulsory military service period from one year to two years. Therefore, the war atmosphere shrouding the European continent has not only not dissipated slightly, but has become even stronger.</p>
<p>The extension of the national compulsory military service period is a new stage in Germany's basic policy of rearmament. To explain this issue, we may as well trace the course of rearmament. From 1919 to 1933, Germany was restricted by the Treaty of Versailles. Within twelve years, it was only allowed to establish 96,000 professional soldiers and 4,000 officers. All offensive weapons were prohibited by the treaty. Forts were also not allowed to be repaired, and the Rhineland was designated as a demilitarized zone where troops were not allowed to be stationed. However, after Hitler came to power in January 1933, the situation was very different. The entire Germany became a training ground, and all the armaments factories were accelerating the production of deadly weapons. In 1935, it tore off the mask of complying with the treaty and revealed the truth. The law of March 16 restored the one-year compulsory conscription system, followed by labor service. The law of May 21 also decided that all nationals should be managed by the military. As a result, by the end of that year, it had formed 24 infantry regiments, 3 mechanized combat divisions, and 2 cavalry regiments, totaling no less than 480,000 people. On March 7 this year, Germany abandoned the provisions of the demilitarized zone and advanced troops into the Rhineland. On the 24th of this month, it extended the one-year conscription system stipulated in the law of March 16 last year to two years. According to general estimates, in one year, Germany's army will increase to 1.2 million people. Such unlimited expansion of armaments will inevitably turn Germany's entire industry into an arsenal and all the people into war machines. Originally, Germany under Hitler's rule contained many contradictions. In order to resolve the internal contradictions, consolidate the shaky National Socialist Party regime, and realize the dream of the Third Reich, it naturally had to actively organize armaments and seek development abroad. Therefore, whenever there was an opportunity to make excuses, it would push the expansion of armaments one step further. The excuse for restoring the conscription system was that France extended the military service period. The excuse for advancing troops into the Rhineland was the conclusion of the mutual assistance agreement between France and the Soviet Union. The recent excuse for extending the military service period was that the Soviet Union advanced the age of enlistment. These excuses are actually somewhat putting the cart before the horse.</p>
<p>Some people say that Germany has already accepted the agreement not to interfere in the Spanish Civil War, and yet it has dropped the bombshell of extending the military service period. Isn't this a contradiction? In fact, the meaning of the so-called non-interference agreement is to strictly maintain neutrality towards both sides of the Spanish Civil War. However, it has long been a public fact that the rebel side in the Spanish Civil War has received assistance from fascist countries. Now, the rebel side has received a large amount of support and has gained a considerable advantage in the war. This time, Germany can isolate the assistance of peace-loving people to the Spanish government army in the name of non-interference, and naturally it is happy to do a favor. As for following the hypocritical compromise with this gunpowder-like bombshell, its intention is naturally nothing more than to threaten the world's peace front.</p>

<h3>Pacific Institute Discusses US Far East Policy; Expand Navy to Counter Japanese Threat; Japanese Representatives Advocate Revising the Nine-Power Treaty</h3>
<p>Yosemite The Pacific Institute continued its meeting today. US branch secretary Field stated that in 1935, the United States spent more than 600 million yuan to promote its Far East policy. Most of it was used to expand the navy in order to counter the threat from Japan. The economic benefits of this policy in the United States that year only reached 84 million yuan, most of which came from commerce and investment. Therefore, in terms of economic value, this policy was indeed not worth the loss. However, the US policy also has important non-economic characteristics and cannot be shifted by revenue and expenditure. The US Navy is dealing with the country from which we obtain the greatest benefits. It is no secret that the United States maintains a strong navy in the Pacific, specifically against Japan. In addition, the United States also spends millions of yuan annually to station troops in the Far East. (Guomin Telegram on the 26th)</p>
<p>Yosemite The Pacific Institute held its first plenary session today to discuss the issue of peace organization in the Pacific. US representative McDonald stated that the outbreak of war in the Far East will inevitably lead to an unprecedented world war. The failure of the Washington Conference was due to the failure to take into account the changes in the Far East at that time. Before we hope to guarantee peace in the Far East, we must recognize three fundamental principles: (1) We should recognize Japan's special geographical position, (2) China should be determined to maintain its independence, and (3) Japan should recognize that other countries are determined not to give up their interests in the Far East. Canadian representative Duff said that the weakening of British and American forces in the Far East is the main reason for the current situation. Both countries are no longer able to do anything in the Far East. The United Kingdom is unwilling to recognize the facts, while the United States is more practical. Duff also advocated organizing a collective security system based on the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Batavian representatives advocated direct negotiations between the countries involved, which should be done by China and Japan, and advocated that the League of Nations host a meeting. The conference then held a round table meeting. Japanese representative Kuni requested to convene a meeting to revise the Nine-Power Treaty before the meeting, but expressed willingness to revise the treaty based on the Kellogg-Briand Pact, rather than having the League of Nations host it, and said that since the signing of the Nine-Power Treaty, the rise of Soviet Russia has changed the situation in the Pacific.

<p>Yosemite Former Chinese government adviser Sir Wilder warned the Pacific Institute today that if Japan invades the Philippines, it will threaten Singapore, and Anglo-Japanese relations will inevitably become serious. Japanese interests will inevitably conflict with the internal affairs of the Philippines one day. At that time, Japan will declare that Japanese interests have been damaged by the political interference or inability to protect the Philippine government. At that time, British territories can no longer rest easy by saying that Japan is busy in the north and has no time to advance south. (Guomin Telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>Yosemite Japanese representative Yoshizawa Kenkichi then continued to speak, saying that China has always adopted a fierce anti-Japanese attitude, while Japan's development in China is inevitable due to population expansion. Finally, representatives from Canada, the Netherlands, and the Australian Federation expressed their support for the proposal to establish a collective security system proposed by the US representative.

<h3>Renewed Disputes Between Japan and Russia: Russia Claims Japanese Planes Crossed the Border, Japan Claims Russian Cavalry Crossed the Border</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Arita invited Soviet Ambassador to Japan Yurenev to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at noon on the 27th, lodging a serious protest regarding the unlawful border crossing incident on the 26th by the Soviet Far Eastern Army in the vicinity of Suning in eastern Manchuria. He also expressed regret over the recent unlawful acts by the Red Army along the eastern border of the Soviet-Manchurian border, stating that if such provocative incidents are not eradicated from the border line, it will have a significant impact on the relations between Japan and the Soviet Union. Therefore, he requested the Soviet government to seriously consider this. The Soviet Ambassador avoided giving a definite answer, citing that he had not received a report from the area. Furthermore, Ambassador Ueda stationed in Manchuria, considering the seriousness of the matter, has telegraphed Consul Okitsu in Suifenhe to lodge a serious protest. (27th Allied Telegram)</p>
<p>(Moscow) According to a report from Khabarovsk, incidents of Japanese aircraft violating Soviet borders have been increasing recently. From August 14th to 23rd of this year, Japanese aircraft have flown into Soviet territory from the "Manchukuo" border as many as five times. At 11:50 AM on the 14th of this month, a single-engine Japanese "reconnaissance-type" aircraft, at an altitude of 1,500 meters, crossed the border 6 kilometers southeast of the village of Sangfunk and flew 6 kilometers into Soviet territory. It then flew north, passing directly over Bosanying Mountain in Soviet territory before turning west and flying back to "Manchukuo" at 12:05 PM. At 12:05 PM on the 16th of this month, a Japanese "reconnaissance" aircraft, at an altitude of 500 meters, crossed the border 2 kilometers southwest of the Kotanyikov border station, flying 4 kilometers north into Soviet territory. At 11:55 AM on the 17th of this month, a Japanese reconnaissance aircraft crossed the border 6 kilometers southeast of the Xilan River and immediately flew towards Manchuria. At 12:30 PM on the 17th of this month, a Japanese reconnaissance aircraft crossed the border at the "Moroznaya" area of Badi (4 kilometers northwest of Vinogrovka village in the area of Lake Ka), intruding 600 meters into Soviet territory, flying one kilometer north, and then turning towards the town of Panzi River (transliterated) and flying back to "Manchukuo." On the 23rd of this month, another border crossing incident occurred. This time, two Japanese aircraft crossed into Soviet territory 15 kilometers at border station number 22 and then flew back to "Manchukuo" via border station number 23.

<p>(Changchun) The Kwantung Army authorities announced the details of the Soviet cavalry border crossing incident on the afternoon of the 26th, stating that a Japanese observation team discovered 20 Soviet cavalrymen at 11:30 AM on the 26th, emerging from the Soviet Secret Police Department east of Dongning County, crossing the border river, and intruding into the Wushegou area of Manchuria. When the Russian soldiers saw the Japanese soldiers monitoring their actions, they immediately opened fire. The Japanese soldiers were forced to return fire and drive them out of the territory. The Russian soldiers abandoned one corpse and withdrew into Soviet territory. Before long, the Russian side increased reinforcements of 70 cavalrymen, carrying two heavy machine guns, and their posture suggested an intention to cross the border and attack the Japanese soldiers. The Japanese garrison is on alert for this, and the two sides are in a standoff. (26th Allied Telegram)</p>

Counselor Lapit of the Soviet Embassy in Japan visited Togo, Director of the European and American Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at 3:30 PM on the 26th to request the release of the detained Russian ship.

Therefore, after the investigation is completed, he can mediate its release. Lapit understood the intention and left the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (27th Allied Telegram)</p>
<h3>Stalin's Speech to the Red Army: Soviet Russia Denies the Incident, Calling it a Provocative Rumor</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The British Evening Standard carried a report on August 26th, claiming that Stalin gave a widespread speech to the Soviet army, saying "War is about to break out" and "This is the time to need you, and now your motherland hopes that you will complete the task you have longed for." The "Evening Standard" also said that Voroshilov, Tukhachevsky, and Alksnis also spoke in the same tone. The TASS News Agency is authorized to declare that the "Evening Standard's" so-called Stalin's widespread speech to the army is a complete provocative rumor. Stalin did not make this speech or appeal, and Voroshilov, Tukhachevsky, and Alksnis did not take this action. (27th TASS Telegram)</p>
<h3>The U.S. State Department Denies Convening a World Peace Conference: One Account Says the Idea is in its Embryonic Stage</h3>
<p>(Washington) The State Department today considered the rumor that President Roosevelt is considering convening a world peace conference and inviting dignitaries from various countries to participate as nonsense, and said that the President is indeed very concerned about the international disputes caused by the Spanish Civil War, but he has not considered initiating a peace conference. The United States also rejected the peace movement initiated by Uruguay last week to resolve the Spanish Civil War. (26th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt left the White House yesterday to inspect the drought-stricken areas in the west. The special train he was riding on has now arrived in Chicago. The President said on the train that the United States has not taken any steps to initiate the convening of a world peace conference. As for the rumor that he intends to invite authorities from major powers to attend the conference in his personal name, the President neither confirmed nor denied it. (26th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(New York) Regarding President Roosevelt's plan to convene a world peace conference, the New York Times recently published an article by political problem expert Kluck stating that the President has notified a few close friends of this plan, but it is still in its embryonic stage and no specific decisions have been made. The President believes that even if convening a peace conference is only an expression and cannot become a reality, it is a powerful expression enough to prevent the outbreak of war from developing and spreading for many years. In short, if the authorities of various countries can jointly declare their desire for peace and restore confidence to the nations, it will be of great benefit. (26th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) The New York Times reported this morning that President Roosevelt intends to convene a world peace conference after being elected and taking office soon. Political figures here have commented on this news. Democrats generally believe that the President is now planning to make a final effort to appease Europe. Once the success or failure of this effort is clear, the United States can then determine the policy it should adopt, that is, whether it should adopt an isolationist policy externally and what measures should be taken internally in the event of any war to ensure strict neutrality. Regarding this point, observers of the party believe that once a war breaks out, American ships and American people are very likely to be affected and cause accidents, which will involve the United States in the vortex of war. If you want to avoid it, it is by no means enough to rely on the current neutrality law alone. (26th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japan Expresses Willingness to Participate in World Conference: Italy Expresses Doubt</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The New York Times reported that President Roosevelt intends to convene a world peace conference in Washington. Japanese diplomatic authorities have not yet received this information, so they will not criticize it for the time being. However, the world peace conference must be based on the premise of President Roosevelt's re-election. In fact, the presidential election is unpredictable, and this can be regarded as Democratic Party propaganda for the presidential election. Since Japan withdrew from the League of Nations, it has in principle adopted a non-cooperative approach to international conferences that maintain the old status quo. However, if all countries in the world make active efforts to establish and promote world peace and eliminate the causes that threaten peace, Japan is also prepared and eager to participate in this group of countries. (27th Same Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) The New York Times recently reported that if US President Roosevelt can be re-elected in November of this year, he intends to convene a world peace conference, inviting the authorities of major countries to attend together, in order to lay the foundation for the world situation. Fascist Party members here all expressed doubts about this proposal, saying that Italy has never dared to believe in the effectiveness of convening international conferences. Only if the participants are limited to a small number of countries and the topics discussed are limited to practical and specific issues can success be hoped for. As far as Italy is concerned, it would rather have the countries concerned conduct direct negotiations on various issues in order to conclude practical agreements, such as the Rome Protocol established twice by Italy, Austria and Hungary in March of the previous year and this year.

<h3>Prime Minister Hirota Decides to Abolish the Custom of Visiting Saionji to Avoid Discussions of Elder Statesmen Interfering in Politics</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Hirota, in view of the experiences of the May 15th Incident and the February 26th Incident, believes that it is necessary to clearly define the Prime Minister's responsibilities and has decided to stop the past practice of successive Prime Ministers visiting Elder Saionji to report on the political situation. That is, in the past, the Prime Minister, after the end of the parliament or at other appropriate times, would visit Elder Saionji every month to report on the general situation of the political situation. As a result, the general public misunderstood that elder statesmen were interfering in politics. Prime Minister Hirota took office with the mission of stabilizing people's hearts and eradicating the roots of political disasters, so in order to avoid misunderstandings in the world, he has this intention.

<h3>Four-Ministry Meeting in Japan: Electricity Nationalization Issue: Responding to Public Opposition</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The related four-ministry meeting to deliberate on the electricity control bill was held at the Prime Minister's official residence on the morning of the 27th. Minister of Communications Raizo Tanaka, Minister of Finance Baba Eiichi, Minister of Commerce and Industry Ogawa Gotaro, and Director-General of Railways Maeda Yonezo attended. Minister of Communications Tanaka first said, "Regarding the electricity control bill, I hope to quickly decide the government's attitude. However, because the issue is quite important, it tends to be used for political purposes. Therefore, in this sense, I hope that each minister will fully examine the content of the bill and carefully discuss and decide it." Then, he explained the original plan of the Ministry of Communications in detail, and strongly stated that (1) in order to realize abundant and low-cost electricity, it is absolutely necessary to nationalize it; (2) the public's opposition criticizes the original plan of the Ministry of Communications, saying that its starting point is in national socialist ideology, but in fact there is no basis for this, etc. He gave examples to illustrate. Later, Minister of Finance Baba and Minister of Commerce and Industry Ogawa questioned the content of the original plan, and also had various questions about the Ministry of Communications' rebuttal of public opposition. As a result, the meeting did not substantially review the content of the original plan on that day, and then decided to reopen the meeting at 9:00 AM on September 5th at the Minister of Communications official residence, and then adjourned at 12:10 PM. Before the next meeting, the Ministry of Communications will prepare rebuttal materials against public opposition, which will be used as the basis for deliberation. (27th Allied Telegram)</p>

<h3>The Day the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty Was Signed: Egypt Designated as National Day: Students in Cairo March with Flags</h3>
<p>(Cairo) The Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of Alliance and Friendship was officially signed in London yesterday. The government has issued an order to designate August 26, the day the new treaty was signed, as the anniversary of the Egyptian National Day. In addition, several hundred young students belonging to the National Party's stormtroopers wore blue shirts and marched with flags last night to celebrate. (27th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) Commentators here today all believe that after the signing of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, Britain has changed Egypt from a "dependency" to a "partner," and that after its implementation, it will strengthen Britain's maritime and military position in the Mediterranean. Italy recently made threats, saying that it would control Britain's "lifeline" through India and the Far East. Now that the treaty has been concluded, the clues before and after are not without trace. The treaty stipulates that Britain will gradually withdraw its troops stationed in Egypt as a concession to the Egyptian National Party. In the future, the main defense forces will be moved to the Suez Canal area. An international conference will be held in Cairo this winter to discuss the abolition of the consular court system and return all judicial power over foreigners to Egypt. At the same time, Egyptians will also be able to immigrate to Sudan, purchase property, and participate in political activities. (26th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) After the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of Alliance and Friendship was officially signed by delegations from both sides in the Locarno Room of the Foreign Office here yesterday morning, the Morning Post published an article criticizing it, stating that if the content of the treaty is really as rumored by semi-official sources, then it is feared that Britain sacrificed real interests in signing this treaty in exchange for some uncertain future benefits. It is hoped that the truth of this treaty will not be as bad as reported by the semi-official side. Those who attended the signing ceremony yesterday morning were worried about the common and individual destinies of Britain and Egypt. How many people there were, this is what we want to know.

<p>(Madrid) The battle for the rebel forces to capture the capital and the battles at Irun and San Sebastian in the north are now progressing simultaneously. It is reported that the government militia is now less than 200 yards from the summit of the Leon Pass, a strategic point north of Madrid. A column of government troops has been ordered to move northeast, aiming to encircle the flanks of the rebel forces in the Guadarrama Mountains. At the same time, a second column has been transferred to the Navarre Pilar area, intending to encircle the rebel forces on the left flank and link up with the first column to surround all the enemies. Aerial attacks are currently very fierce. (27th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hendaye) The Battle of Irun, which began yesterday, continued at dawn today. Government planes first attacked the rebel forces and bombarded them with artillery. The government forces defending the city had the upper hand in yesterday's battle. In the afternoon and evening, the rebel forces launched a three-pronged simultaneous attack on Irun and San Sebastian, with extremely intense artillery fire and aircraft assistance, but they were finally contained by the defending forces and could not make progress. (27th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hendaye) Although the rebel forces in northern Spain launched another attack on the city of Irun at noon today, they still failed. After repelling the rebel forces, the government forces in the city have begun to counterattack. Prior to this, three rebel aircraft flew near the city and dropped nine bombs on the highway leading to the town of Saint-Mace, hoping to prevent grain trucks from driving to the city, but all missed, so the highway remained intact. The government troops' cars were still able to drive at full speed past the road. As for a team of rebel forces detouring through the nearby Turia Mountains, they were only able to advance under the cover of artillery fire, but the government forces' position was extremely solid, and it seemed difficult to succeed for a while. (27th Havas Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hendaye) A special dispatch from our reporter: When the rebel forces in northern Spain, including regular troops, Moroccan native troops, fascist troops, and Carlist troops, attacked the city of Irun this morning, they indiscriminately machine-gunned everything, regardless of anything, and the situation was extremely tragic. The rebel forces' position was originally not as solid as the government forces', so it was beneficial to a quick battle. Although the rebel forces used tanks and armored vehicles to assist in the battle, they were unable to fully exert their effectiveness due to the inconvenient terrain. Afterwards, the rebel forces bombed the city with aircraft, but the damage was minimal. (27th Havas Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Madrid) The government announced that the rebel forces attacking Irun in the north had left 200 corpses behind and collapsed after only six hours of fierce fighting. (27th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Rebel Army Abandons Strategy of Directly Attacking Irun, Reinforcements Arrive to Outflank Along the Mountains</h3>
<p>Andaye - In today's battle for the Irun area, artillery plays a significant role. Both sides have one airplane each, flying back and forth in the sky, using signals to report the accuracy of artillery fire. The rebel army, seeing that the government troops are entrenched and fortified, has abandoned its strategy of directly attacking Irun. The rebel reinforcements arrived this morning from Bargos and have advanced into the mountains. Although these reinforcements are hampered on the small paths in the valleys, they seem to be making progress along the small peaks. The area near the French border is currently in great danger. An area about a mile wide between Andaye and Behobia is now closed to traffic. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>Andaye - Although the Irun area has been fiercely attacked by the rebel army's artillery and aircraft, the Spanish government troops have so far been able to repel the rebels. On the rebel side, more than seven hundred foreign legionnaires newly arrived from Morocco have come to reinforce their ranks and are simultaneously advancing on Irun and San Sebastian in three directions. The thunder of heavy artillery continues day and night. Currently, the most intense fighting is on the main road from Pamplona to Irun between Aranda and Labencia. The rebel army has repeatedly launched attacks, but has been blocked by the defending troops. In the afternoon, several rebel aircraft flew over Irun and dropped forty to fifty bombs. The number of casualties and the extent of the damage are not yet known. The residents remaining in the area have been evacuating. Today, dozens of people have arrived in Andaye, mostly women and children. The rebel aircraft later dropped leaflets over Irun, issuing a final warning to the defending troops, giving them until 8:00 PM to surrender the city, or it would suffer the same fate as Badajoz. However, the defending troops ignored the warning, so fighting continued in Irun into the night. The defending troops have a slight advantage. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>Andaye - After a day of intense fighting in the Spanish northern city of Irun and its surrounding area yesterday, the night was temporarily quiet. As dawn broke today, the artillery fire resumed. The government troops are still using aircraft and artillery to bombard the rebel positions fiercely, and have dispatched a unit of militia from San Sebastian to attack an area fifteen kilometers from the city in order to contain the rebel forces in the Irun area. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>Andaye - A special dispatch from our correspondent: heavy fighting occurred simultaneously on land and in the air near the city of Irun in northern Spain throughout the entire day today. The thunder of artillery fire did not cease all day long, and several shells landed in the small village of Behobia on the French border. However, as of 8:00 PM, the city of Irun was still in the hands of the government troops. Earlier, the battle situation this morning was extremely fierce. In the afternoon, a large number of fresh rebel troops arrived here from Entella Chai Village and immediately joined the battle. Among them were foreign legionnaires and native Moroccan soldiers. They initially concentrated in Aranda City, and then divided into small teams of fifty men each, advancing stealthily along the cornfields in the hope of breaking into the center of the firing line. However, the government troops held firmly to the high ground of Labencia, which overlooks the battlefield, and a fierce battle ensued. At the same time, in the air, aircraft from both sides circled and pursued each other, dropping bombs on each other's positions. As of 7:00 PM, when the reporter left the battlefield, the rebel army appeared to have stopped its offensive, while the government troops continued to hold their positions firmly, with a great air of impregnability. The rebel army used armored vehicles to charge, but the ground they crossed had just been plowed, and the soil was loose, rendering these effective instruments of attack ineffective. Ambulances from both sides were on the battlefield, constantly transporting the wounded, indicating that the number of casualties must be very high, but the exact figures are still difficult to ascertain. According to a later announcement by the People's Front Committee of the Government Army in Irun, a large force of rebel troops attacked today along the 13-kilometer line from Irun to Guetaria, including Moroccan regular troops, fascist party troops, Carlist restorationist troops, foreign legionnaires, and others. After six hours of intense fighting, they were finally repelled by our troops, leaving 200 bodies behind. Our troops suffered only one death and three injuries. When the reporter returned from observing the battle and arrived at the village of Behobia, he could see the mountains shrouded in the twilight, and the sporadic gunfire could still be heard clearly. It is said that several aircraft belonging to the rebel army flew to Irun today and dropped leaflets warning the residents of the city that if they did not surrender by 8:00 PM tonight, then as soon as the rebel army entered the city, they would follow the example of the city of Badajoz and slaughter all the residents of the city. From this, it can be seen that fierce battles will continue to occur in the Irun area. In addition, the city of San Sebastian was as peaceful as ever today, with no fighting. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>Madrid - A special dispatch from our correspondent: the positions of the government troops in the area of the Lion Pass north of the capital are extremely fortified, but the rebel army is not showing any weakness. As a result of days of fierce fighting, the government troops have only been able to advance 200 meters. According to news from the southern city of Malaga, several government aircraft flew over the port of Ceuta in Moroccan territory and severely damaged the rebel warships "España" and "Cinco" which were docked there. They also dropped bombs on the city of Melilla in Morocco, Cordoba City headquarters, and the port of Cadiz, and shot down two rebel aircraft. (Havas, 27th)</p>

It is reported that the government troops are at least able to hold their positions. (National Telegram, 26th)</p>

<h3>The Spanish Non-Intervention Agreement: Britain and France Actively Proceed, Plan to Establish a Committee in London to Discuss and Implement Various Measures</h3>
<p>(Paris) - The British and French governments today separately contacted the eighteen countries that have not yet adhered to the agreement on non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War, urging them to implement it immediately without further delay. Several of these countries are prepared to unilaterally embargo arms. The Portuguese government today notified France that it is prepared to take action in accordance with the policy of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War. The French government is now assuming that all countries that have not yet complied with the non-intervention agreement will implement it immediately, and has therefore invited the relevant countries to participate in further discussions. At the same time, the French side has also proposed the establishment of a permanent committee composed of representatives from countries that adhere to the non-intervention agreement, so that when the neutral measures taken by the governments of various countries progress, they can notify each other to avoid misunderstandings. The committee may be located in London. The measures planned by the ambassadors of various countries to Spain to alleviate the suffering of prisoners of war and other people affected by the civil war will also be considered by the committee. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) - The five countries of Britain, France, Germany, Russia, and Portugal have either implemented or expressed their acceptance of various measures to prohibit the transport of arms to Spain. According to sources in official circles, the British and French governments also intend to simultaneously contact the governments of Italy, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Belgium, Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, Greece, Poland, Austria, Latvia, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland in order to urge those governments to accept the embargo measures as soon as possible. As for the French proposal to organize an international committee to supervise the implementation, those in semi-official circles here understand that the British government is also in favor of this proposal. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) - According to news today, the French government has proposed that a permanent committee be organized by representatives of countries participating in the agreement on non-interference in Spanish affairs, with the location of the meeting place possibly being London. The purpose of the committee is to maintain close contact between the governments of the relevant countries, and to receive detailed reports of the neutral plans adopted by the countries. The committee will also consider the special plans that should be implemented. At the same time, France is rapidly moving forward with the non-interference plan, paying close attention to making earnest appeals to countries that have not yet announced a ban on arms shipments to Spain. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>Lisbon - The government had previously expressed its acceptance in principle of the non-interference in the internal disorder agreement. It has now issued an order prohibiting the direct transport of arms to Spain or their re-export to that country, and at the same time stating that if the signatory countries of the non-interference agreement indirectly allow their citizens to volunteer to go to Spain to fight, or to provide financial assistance to the warring factions in that country, then the Portuguese ban will be revoked and invalid. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>Lisbon - The Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a note to France on the 21st of this month accepting participation in the arms embargo to Spain. The note was published last night, containing several reservations, the main points of which are as follows: (above omitted) "Spanish communist and anarchist elements are acting barbarously in the areas they control, which is deeply deplorable. Therefore, in the following circumstances, the government of this country will have to take certain actions. This action should not be considered as having an interfering nature, namely (1) conducting mediation between the two warring factions; (2) safeguarding Western culture to prevent it from being destroyed by communism; (3) maintaining contact with the central and local authorities who have real governing ability; (4) If a new government is formed in Spain, the two warring factions are deemed to be formally belligerent factions." (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>Turkish Capital - Foreign Minister Ruştu recently sent a note to the French Chargé d'Affaires in Turkey, stating that he has decided to participate in the French draft agreement on non-interference in the Spanish internal disorder in order to stabilize the situation. However, the current attitude of this country should not be regarded as a precedent or used as an excuse for future reference. Furthermore, if the legitimate government of another country requests assistance from Turkey because of internal disturbances, Turkey cannot use the current attitude as a fixed and unchanging method.

<p>(Washington) - The Spanish government issued a verbal statement to the governments of various countries on the 20th of this month that all ports occupied by the rebel army in that country will be treated as war zones, and all merchant ships will not be allowed to enter. Secretary of State Hull sent a note to the government of that country last night, stating that before the government of Spain can effectively blockade the ports, American merchant ships should still have the right to enter the ports. The note also mentioned the traditional American principle of freedom of the seas, and cited various precedents to prove the reasons for its position. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) - Greenwood and Sir Citrine, accompanied by officials from the Labour Party and trade unions, went to the Foreign Office this afternoon to continue Wednesday's talks with Foreign Secretary Eden on the current situation in Spain. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) - The opposition Labour Party sent a delegation to meet Foreign Secretary Eden today to discuss the issue of non-interference in the Spanish internal disorder. It is reported that they suggested including kerosene on the list of embargoed goods. It is now known that the government does not intend to adopt the Labour Party's suggestion, because diplomatic figures believe that their government's actions at this time should be limited to supporting France, and there is no need to increase the list of embargoes, which would hinder the progress of the negotiations.

<h3>German Minister of Economy Meets with French Authorities: Discussions Not Limited to Economic Issues</h3>
<p>(Paris) - Dr. Schacht, the German Minister of Economy and President of the Deutsche Reichsbank, arrived here yesterday. The Governor of the Banque de France, Labeyrie, hosted a luncheon for him at noon. Prime Minister Léon Blum, Foreign Minister Delbos, Minister of Economy Spinasse, Finance Minister Auriol, and German Ambassador Welczeck were invited to accompany him. In the evening, Welczeck hosted a banquet for Schacht at the embassy. Various dignitaries and the Secretary General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Léger, and the Director of Political Affairs, Payart, were invited to attend. Judging from the presence of Léger and Payart, it can be seen that the two sides exchanged views on various diplomatic issues in addition to economic issues. However, both sides remained silent about the specific content. The Secretary General of the Communist Party, Thorez, sent a letter to Prime Minister Léon Blum regarding Schacht's visit to France, asking some questions, saying, "German leader Hitler is now striving to carry out an arms race, and world peace and French security are under threat. Is it not detrimental to the dignity of our nation and incompatible with the cause of peace that our government should treat Schacht with such courtesy at this time?" Prime Minister Léon Blum immediately replied in a letter, saying, "A People's Front government will never allow the dignity of France to be infringed upon, and it will take the necessary measures to protect its national security. However, the government is deeply aware that the desire to maintain peace is part of the dignity of France, and the organization of a peace mechanism is part of the protection of security. Therefore, the government never despairs of the prospects for peace, no matter what. Even after Germany has extended the term of military service, if that country is willing to conduct talks with France on economic, financial, or political issues, the nature of which would make it easier to find a general solution to various European issues, France will naturally not refuse." (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>(Paris) - Since Dr. Schacht, the German Minister of Economy and President of the Deutsche Reichsbank, arrived here the other day, there have been rumors that the purpose of Schacht's trip is to borrow money from France. Various newspapers here have recently commented on this, believing that although the German government claims that its extension of the term of military service is aimed at reducing unemployment, it is feared that Schacht himself would have difficulty providing assurances that the loan would indeed be used for peaceful purposes. The newspapers also believe that Schacht may have come to explain to the French government the crisis that the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Pact could cause. The communist newspaper "L'Humanité" is deeply concerned about Germany's organization of an "anti-Russian crusade," while the famous Figaro reporter Romier said that Schacht may have put forward an international plan on the issue of industrial equipment. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) - Political figures here are paying close attention to the fact that Dr. Schacht, the Minister of Economy and President of the Deutsche Reichsbank, was well received by the French during his return visit to France. As a result, they are reminded of the visit of Banque de France Governor Labeyrie to Berlin earlier, saying that the reciprocal visits of financial figures from the two countries are enough to alleviate the various restrictive measures that hinder international trade. Germany believes that it is abnormal to subordinate international economic policy to diplomatic policy, but that political compromise by means of economic rapprochement is still possible today. The Berliner Tageblatt also criticized Schacht's trip, saying that the Locarno Five-Power Conference is about to be held. If the differences between the countries have not been eliminated, then even if the conference is convened, it will be useless. Schacht is familiar with international politics and the important impact that economic issues should have. We hope that Schacht's trip will be helpful to the relations between France and Germany. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>(Paris) - Dr. Schacht, the German Minister of Economy and President of the Deutsche Reichsbank, is scheduled to return to his country tomorrow. Before his departure, he will meet with Banque de France Governor Labeyrie again. After returning to his country, he will often go to Berchtesgaden to report the results of this trip to Hitler.

<h3>Joint Commemoration of Confucius' Birthday by the Central Government and the National Government, Presided Over by Chairman Ding Weifen, Who Also Gave a Report; Grand Commemorations Held Throughout the Country</h3>

At 8:00 AM sharp, the meeting began with music. Chairman Ding Weifen led everyone in bowing according to the rituals and gave an impromptu report, saying, "Today is the day of Confucius' birth. The National Government has ordered all citizens of the country to hold a grand commemoration. The purpose of this is to encourage everyone to promote Confucius' morals and learning as the foundation of the country. Confucius' morals are lofty and vast, and cannot be explained in a short time. I hope that everyone will read the Analects regularly, and then they can understand. If we act according to the book, we can become people of high character and useful to the country. Because the Analects is a book that records Confucius' words and deeds, it is our compass for learning Confucius' morals and learning, and it can also be said to be a textbook for self-cultivation. As long as we read it carefully and act accordingly, it will be beneficial to our personal mind and body. Therefore, today's worship of Confucius is to learn from Confucius, and to learn from Confucius, we must read the Analects and put it into practice." After the speech, the meeting was adjourned.

<h3>Finance Minister Kong Speaks: The Central Government Advocates Peace Regarding the Guangxi Affair; Reorganizing Guangdong's Finances Can Get on Track</h3>
<p>(Jiujiang) Guling telephone report: A Central News Agency reporter visited Deputy Director Kong on the morning of the 27th and asked about the Guangxi affair. Kong said that the Central Government and Chairman Chiang had always advocated a peaceful resolution to the Guangxi situation and were currently seeking various ways to break the deadlock, hoping that Li and Bai could quickly come to their senses and not mislead themselves and the country. The Central Government had already rescinded the arrest warrant for Chen and Li, and there was no reason not to treat Li and Bai with leniency and cherish them. Regarding Director Huang's entry into Guangxi, Kong said there was no definite information. Regarding the amnesty for political prisoners, Kong said that this matter should be discussed and handled by the Central Standing Committee. As for the reorganization of Guangdong Province's finances and financial affairs, Director Song is currently handling it in accordance with instructions, and it will soon be on track. The people of Guangdong have long suffered from hardship, and they should be able to live and work in peace in the future. Guangdong Province's finances and financial affairs were in great disorder due to the harsh policies of the previous authorities over the years. This time, in a short period of time, Vice Ministers Zheng and Xu, Special Commissioner Song, Advisor Chen, Vice President Chen, and Bank Presidents Tang and Bei were sent to Guangdong twice, adhering to President Chiang's intentions, to plan and reorganize, which has already achieved good results. It can be seen that if government orders are unified and the central government is consolidated, all difficult problems can be solved and the suffering of the people can be reduced. He hopes that the people of the whole country, the military and civilian officials of all provinces, will understand the importance of unity and solidarity and jointly support the central government and consolidate the central government's power.

<h3>The Ministry of Finance Rejects Guangdong City Chamber of Commerce's Telegram Request to Redeem Subsidiary Coins at a Premium</h3>
<p>(Jiujiang) Guling telephone report: Regarding the Guangdong City Chamber of Commerce's telegram requesting that subsidiary coins be redeemed at a premium of 3%, the Ministry of Finance had previously replied to the Chamber's telegram. Later, Zou Dianbang, the chairman of the Chamber, submitted another request to the Ministry. The Ministry of Finance, based on its previous telegram, replied, roughly stating: The telegram of the 11th has been received. It has been found that the subsidiary coins were privately issued by Guangdong Province, with a total amount of 250 million yuan, while the cash reserves were only 10.7 million yuan in silver coins, accounting for 4.3% of the total issue amount. According to the 46% reserve requirement, the shortfall is 1.7%, which is not reliable. In reality, two yuan and three jiao of subsidiary coins are worth one yuan of silver, resulting in a loss of credibility. The province should be held responsible for clearing them up. In consideration of the suffering of the people of Guangdong Province, the Ministry is now properly preparing to replenish the reserves to consolidate the credibility of the subsidiary coins in Guangzhou, especially to show compassion. As for the continued collection of silver, new banknotes must be issued according to law with reserves. If only the issuance is considered and not the reserves, it will repeat the mistakes of the past of excessive issuance of subsidiary coins. Therefore, the continued collection of silver cannot be included in the reserves of the issued subsidiary coins. The matter is very clear. Furthermore, the so-called purchase of silver at a premium of 2% is a separate matter from the stipulated exchange rate of subsidiary coins and should not be discussed together. Moreover, one should not hope for undue benefits now because they did not receive benefits in the past. As for the statement that subsidiary coins were exchanged for silver dollars at a premium of no more than 3% in previous years, it should be known that the real value of subsidiary coins is different now and in the past, so it is difficult to force them to be consistent. Moreover, Guangdong Province has suffered from harsh policies for many years, and its economy has been deeply depressed. For example, Guangdong silk, which is a major export of the province, has seen a sharp decline in exports in recent years, although it is due to the dumping of rayon. However, the high cost, which makes it difficult to compete with foreign countries, is an important reason. Therefore, reorganizing the subsidiary coins is important, but the principles of revitalizing the economy of the entire province must be followed. If there is any impropriety, it will adversely affect the economy of Guangdong Province, which is contrary to the original intention of the Central Government to reorganize the subsidiary coins and not what the people of Guangdong Province hope for. Therefore, it is necessary to properly plan and stipulate in accordance with the key points of stabilizing finance, reviving industry, and developing the economy, and strive to revitalize the economy of Guangdong Province. You should wait quietly for the regulations to be handled. (Central News Agency telegram, 27th)</p>
<h3>He Yaozu Arrives in the Capital to Report to Foreign Minister Zhang</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) He Yaozu, the envoy to Turkey, arrived in the capital from Shanghai on the morning of the 27th. At noon, he visited Foreign Minister Zhang to report on everything and also met with the two Vice Ministers, Xu and Chen. Because He had been away from the country for a long time, all affairs were piled up, and he will stay in the capital for a longer period of time to handle them and wait to meet with Chairman Lin to report. Whether he will go to Guangdong to meet Chiang or wait in the capital to meet him will be determined after he telegraphs for instructions. He said that the reconstruction work in Turkey and the current general progress have been published in detail in Shanghai. This time, in addition to reporting on his duties, he will also request instructions on everything. The Sino-Turkish commercial treaty is being negotiated by Minister Hu Shize in Geneva with the Turkish envoy to Switzerland, but it has not yet reached the stage of conclusion. The Turkish envoy to our country will be reappointed to China soon, and our embassy in Turkey will not be abolished, as rumored.

<h3>Wang Yongbin Discusses the Procedures for Amnesty of Political Prisoners</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Central government officials mostly agree with the amnesty for political prisoners. Someone visited Wang Yongbin, Minister of Justice and Administration, and asked about the amnesty procedures. According to him, the amnesty should be carried out by order of the National Government, but the scope of the amnesty and detailed measures should be formulated through legislative procedures to create an amnesty ordinance. If it is clearly stated that the amnesty is only for political prisoners, then ordinary criminal offenders in the country will naturally not be included. Currently, the number of political prisoners in the country is approximately 2,100 in ordinary prisons and more than 1,060 in rehabilitation centers in various provinces. Those not in ordinary prisons have not yet been counted. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>

<h3>Military Situation in Guangxi Province Becomes Increasingly Serious; Guangxi Troops Approach Qinlian in Guangdong Province; Wuzhou Land and Water Routes Blockaded; Guangxi Establishes Trade Office in Longzhou; Liuzhou Promulgates Martial Law Regulations</h3>
<p>Guangzhou dispatch: In recent days, negotiations regarding the Guangxi affair have yet to yield any concrete solutions. Messengers have been traveling back and forth, but Li and Bai of Guangxi have yet to show any determination to step down. Since the 19th, Guangxi troops have been successively moving east to guard the southwestern border of Guangdong. The newly reorganized 19th Route Army under Cai Tingkai in Guangxi has been deployed to the front lines, causing panic on the southern border of Guangdong Province. It is reported that on the 24th, a portion of the Guangxi troops had invaded Luwu in Qinxian, Guangdong Province (Luwu is about 150 li from Nanxiang on the Guangxi border). On the 25th, they continued to advance towards Beihai and other places. Finance and tax officials in Qilian loaded the tax revenue onto warships on the 24th and transported it back to the provincial capital. Qinxian is not far from Liangning in Guangxi Province. The Guangxi troops' invasion of Qinzhou and Beihai is both an attempt to open up a sea route and to create a buffer for Nanning. As such, Qilian in Guangdong Province may not be spared from the war. At the same time, Nanning has recently tightened martial law. Nearly 2,000 Guangxi military police have been deployed near Nanning and erected anti-aircraft guns on the high ground near the suburbs to prevent air raids. All important institutions in Nanning have secretly moved to another location in preparation for a mobile relocation. As for Wuzhou, since it was blockaded, Guangxi's products have been unable to be exported. It is now reported that a Guangxi export office has been established in Wuzhou to export goods to French Indochina. Therefore, Wuzhou has recently become a military martial law zone and is no longer the bustling trading port it once was. In Guilin, Chen Enyuan, the commander of the militia, is still leading the militia to guard the area from Guilin to Longhuguan Hexian, with Guangxi troops under Wang Zanbin deployed in sections. As for Liuzhou, the location of Guangxi's military agencies, defensive fortifications have been properly arranged. Since the outbreak of hostilities, there has been concern that idlers may infiltrate. Martial law is stricter than in other places. Therefore, since August 7th, it has been announced that pedestrians will be strictly checked to prevent the smuggling of traitors and munitions, and martial law regulations have been promulgated. Anyone who violates the regulations will be punished according to the law. The martial law regulations are as follows:</p>
<p>Anyone who smuggles munitions, damages transportation, burns buildings, creates rumors and incites unrest, or disrupts public order will be executed.</p>
<p>Anyone who privately possesses unregistered firearms without reporting them or carrying them will be investigated and dealt with. The firearms will be confiscated. Those who report and register them will be exempt.</p>
<p>Residents without joint guarantees and travelers in hotels without reliable guarantors will be expelled from the country.</p>
<p>Ships, vehicles, and passengers coming to Liuzhou without guarantors will not be allowed to stay or disembark.</p>
<p>Those who provide false guarantees will be punished with the same crime as the person they guaranteed. Since the promulgation of the above regulations, commercial traffic between Liuzhou and Nanning has decreased sharply. Only special vehicles from the military and political circles travel back and forth. At present, commerce in Wuzhou and Yongning has been depressed. All military supplies are now purchased and sold under government control. Even gasoline has been inspected and purchased. The purchase price is 60% of the market price. As for grains and rice, transportation and exports are prohibited. In the above-mentioned martial law areas, the guards are strict, and the roads are deserted after 7:00 PM at night. The desolate scene is unprecedented. (August 26th)</p>
<h3>Another Robbery on the Minzhanglong Road in Fujian: Intense Gunfight Between Soldiers and Bandits Lasted Three Hours; Four Passengers and Soldiers Killed or Wounded; Truck and Luggage Robbed Clean</h3>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: On the 26th, another robbery occurred on the Minzhanglong Highway in Fujian Province. An intense gunfight between soldiers and bandits lasted several hours, resulting in the deaths of three security team soldiers and the death of a government official's wife. The vehicle was robbed. The details are as follows: On the 26th, the Longyan-based Sixth Army Administrative Supervisor's Office and the Sixth District Security Command chartered two passenger and cargo trucks from the Zhanglong Car Company to transport eighteen security team members to the provincial capital for training. They were led by Squadron Leader Ma Zhinan and Independent Platoon Leader Jiang Zifa. Traveling with them were Wu Renhan, Deputy Commander of the Sixth Administrative District Security; Chen Ziyu, First Section Chief of the Pacification Commissioner's Office; Zhang Guangyuan, Chief Inspector of the Longyan Public Security Bureau; Inspector Zhu Yingdong and his wife; and Jiang Zifa's wife and daughter, totaling twenty-six or twenty-seven people, along with dozens of pieces of luggage. The two trucks departed from Yan City in the early morning. As they approached Xinci, in Shizhong, around eight o'clock, they spotted bandit sentries scattered for several miles. Considering that the passengers were all soldiers, they were prepared and unafraid. When they reached Mentouling near Xinci, over a hundred bandits gradually approached and opened fire on the two trucks. The security team officers and soldiers dismounted and scattered to the left side of the road to return fire. The fighting was fierce and lasted for three hours, until 11:00 AM, when the bandits, fearing the arrival of reinforcements from the garrison, simultaneously fought and divided their forces to surround the trucks, robbing all the valuables and luggage inside. They also kidnapped Jiang Zifa's wife and daughter, retreating after breaking the encirclement. The security team, outnumbered, dared not pursue. Security team soldier Zhang Miaoshou was shot in the head inside the truck and died instantly. Zhu Yingdong's wife was shot in the buttocks, the bullet exiting through her front thigh, also dying instantly. Soldiers Fang Zhenqing was wounded in the waist, and Chen Zonglan was wounded in the wrist. Two Browning pistols were also robbed. Jiang's wife and daughter were taken by the bandits to a nearby valley. After questioning their identities, they were immediately released. The corpses of the dead and the wounded were transported to Shizhong. The corpses were left in Shizhong, and they continued to Zhangzhou, arriving late in the evening. The Zhanglong Company immediately reported the incident to the Pacification Headquarters, requesting the dispatch of troops to encircle and suppress the bandits. On the 17th of this month, two cargo trucks were robbed at Xinci on the Zhanglong Road. Now, just ten days later, another robbery has occurred at the same location. The rampant nature of the bandits can be imagined. (August 27th)</p>
<h3>Recent Situation in North China: Changes Expected in Personnel in Hebei and Chahar; Japanese Actions Increasingly Active</h3>
<p>Beijing Dispatch: The situation in North China has appeared to be very calm recently. This is not only the view of those far away, but even those on the scene have not noticed anything particularly unusual. Since the arrival of Japanese Ambassador to China, Kawagoe Shigeru, in Peiping and Tianjin, Japanese actions have gradually become more active and aggressive. Within this ten-day period, Japanese army and navy attachés and consuls have held consecutive meetings and even joint meetings. It is difficult for outsiders to know the details of their content. However, according to reports from related parties, the meeting discussed the active implementation of investment in Hebei and Chahar, the development of resources, and the strengthening of attitudes towards the Hebei-Chahar political regime. The first step in developing resources is to prioritize transportation, planning to build the Tianjin-Shijiazhuang (Jinshi) Railway, while the Cangzhou-Shijiazhuang (Cangshi) Railway will be discontinued. The second step is to restore the Longyan Iron Mine in Chahar Province and manage cotton planting in Hebei. These measures will be the responsibility of the Xingzhong Company, which is mainly run by the Japanese. The company's president, Sogō Shinji, came to Peiping on the 23rd after being entrusted with the task and met with Song Zheyuan, Qin Dechun, and related parties. He has discussed the issue of road construction and mining with Song. The Japanese hope to invest a large amount of money without restrictions and handle everything. As of the 25th, no concrete results have been obtained. In general, future negotiations with China will be the responsibility of Ambassador Kawagoe. The Japanese believe that the situation in Hebei and Chahar is special (?). Everything should be handled locally. The authorities are carefully considering this statement and have telegraphed the central government for instructions on how to proceed. The situation is changing from moderate to aggressive. The more active others become, the more difficult it becomes for the authorities. Judging from the current situation, difficulties are imminent.</p>
<p>Regarding personnel matters in Hebei and Chahar, there are recent rumors of changes. This matter is likely related to "strengthening." It is rumored that the personnel changes will involve Zhang Zizhong being transferred to head Hebei, Deng Zhexi succeeding as the head of Tianjin City, Chen Zhongfu, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, being transferred to become a senior advisor to the Political Affairs Committee, and Chen Juesheng replacing Chen as the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. The Transportation Committee and Beining Railway Bureau, which Chen chairs, will be taken over by Zhang Yunrong. Zhang Bi is internally designated as the director of the Jinshi Railway Engineering Bureau. Although it is difficult to believe that all of the above is entirely reliable, there is some basis for it. Whether it can be realized in the future is a major question, and how to make it happen will be difficult. As for a certain important figure who has been in seclusion for several months, it is recently learned that he will also be leaving his retreat. Negotiations are currently underway, and he will be traveling far soon. It is said that several secondary figures will accompany him.</p>

Kong Decheng hosted the two directors and other guests. Kong Decheng is growing in learning and age, reading scriptures every day. He has hired professors in science, such as mathematics and history, and has considerable attainments in these fields. He is engaged to the granddaughter of Grand Academician Sun Jianai of the former Qing Dynasty. The wedding is scheduled for November this year, and the location, whether in Jinan or Qufu, has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>Solemn and Grand Sacrificial Ceremony</p>
<p>All the sacrificial etiquette has been carefully prepared by the Directors of Civil Affairs and Education and the Kong Sacrificial Official's Office, and it is extremely solemn and grand. It is scheduled to enter the temple at 7:00 AM on the 27th and visit the mausoleum at 9:00 AM. At that time, drums will be beaten to assemble, and the order of the ceremony will be: 1.

<p>(Sacrificial Positions): On both sides of the Dacheng Hall are the emcees and ushers. The order of the sacrificial positions is: in the front row, the chief sacrificial official in the middle, with the Confucius sacrificial official on his right, followed by the Yan sacrificial official, the Zeng sacrificial official, and the Meng sacrificial official.

<p>Precious Ceremonial Instruments, Ancient Music Lost</p>
<p>The ten sets of ceremonial instruments in the Confucius Temple are entirely from the Zhou Dynasty, the only such set in the country, making them extremely precious. The names are as follows: Zhou Bo Yi, Zhou Xi Zun, Zhou Bao Gui, Zhou Tao Tie, Zhou Four-Legged Li, Zhou Ce You, Zhou Mu Ding, Zhou Bian Feng Dou, Zhou Pan Chi Dun, Zhou Ya Zun, etc. As for the ancient music of Dacheng, it has long been lost. It was not until two years ago, when the central government sent Ye Chucang to Lu Province to offer sacrifices, that a plan was made with the local government and the sacrificial official's office to revive it. The Dacheng Ancient Music Training Institute was established in Qufu with an annual budget of 2,000 yuan approved by the central government, but the funds for the 24th year have not yet been received. The provincial government subsidized 2,000 yuan, and the funds for the 24th year have been received. According to regulations, the orchestra consists of 64 people, divided into departments for qin, se, singing, percussion, and wind instruments. The dance troupe also consists of 64 people, totaling 128 people. Currently, due to financial constraints, the training institute has only recruited 40 people. The musical instruments include qin, di, xiao, zhong, gu, qing, zhu, and yu. The feng xiao and se have long been lost and have become a thing of the past.</p>
<p>Mingde Middle School to Be Changed to Academy</p>
<p>Qufu Mingde Middle School was originally a private school. Now, the internal organization, curriculum, etc., are completely the same as ordinary middle schools. Recently, the Department of Education has submitted a request to the Ministry of Education to change Mingde Middle School to Mingde Academy, focusing on the study of Confucian classics. After the Ministry approves it, the reorganization will begin, and Sacrificial Official Kong Decheng will preside over the academy's affairs.</p>

<h3>Implication of Private Soil After Death</h3>
<p>Gu Fuqi, a postal worker at the First-Class Post Office Parcel Room on Malu Road in the county, committed suicide by electrocution at his home at No. 4 Wangxiang Street under Gu Bridge the day before yesterday. Afterwards, his family found a suicide note in the incense burner on the table. The envelope was addressed to "Chief Executive Liu," and the content roughly stated that "I am sorry to the country, sorry to society, and sorry to my own conscience. This time, the parcels attached to the post office contained private soil, which was done in collusion by so-and-so and 15 other people. I was driven by my conscience, so I committed suicide. After my death, I hope that the local chief executive will thoroughly investigate this case. Even if I die in the underworld, I will be able to rest in peace." After the suicide note was discovered, someone reported it to County Magistrate Long, who ordered Police Chief Wu Zhengrong to summon the deceased's father, Gu Fengshan, and his father-in-law, Fang Bingfu, to the case at 12:00 AM that night. The case was interrogated by Xu Yingtu, chief of the Third Section, for a long time. He ordered that Gu Fuqi's suicide note be used to reinvestigate the case. At 5:00 PM yesterday (the 27th), Xu's section again summoned Zhang Lianyuan, Yang Dahui, Wang Binzhang, Wu Jide, and eight other related personnel to the case for a group interrogation. At the same time, Zhu Suqing, Xu Fuchang, and Feng Xirong were summoned to the case for interrogation. However, the inside story of this case is very complicated.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Searches of Various Chan Temples</h3>
<p>Chen Yu Chu, the director of the Public Security Bureau, has been in Changshu for only half a month. On the 26th, he led police officers to the various Chan temples in Yushan because of reports of large-scale drug trafficking organizations. That morning, Chen summoned Chief Inspector Hong Houchang, the chief of the First Branch Bureau Feng Yimao, the patrol officers of the car patrol team, and special agents, saying that he needed to visit Yushan and the major Chan temples outside the North Gate today and that all personnel had to accompany him. At that time, the people did not pay attention. When they arrived at Xingfu Temple, the monks of the temple set up a vegetarian banquet to entertain them. After the meal, Director Chen announced the above information and ordered all the accompanying personnel to go into action to search. As a result, nothing was found. They then went to the two major Chan monasteries, Lianzhudong Temple and Sanfeng Temple, and conducted similar searches, but no suspicious points were found. Afterwards, they led the team back to the city. According to Second Section Chief Feng Xiaoqing, the above-mentioned situation had been reported in the temple, and there was also some kind of secret organization inside, so it was necessary to personally search.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Arrest of Bandit in Xin'an Town</h3>
<p>The home of Shi Qizhang in Hengbei Township, Fifth District of Wuyi County, was previously robbed, but the case has not yet been solved. The Public Security Fourth Substation in charge recently received a tip that Liu Rongfang, who lived in the Second Bao of Xin'an Town, was a major suspect in the robbery case and had secretly returned to Changzhou from Shanghai. Officer Wu of the station led police officers disguised as civilians to rush there overnight.

<p>Assembly Staff</p>
<p>Presidium: Pan Gongzhan of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Zhang Yuanruo of the Municipal Government, Zhu Xia of the Garrison Headquarters, Zhou Xuexiang of the General Labor Union, Wang Xiaolai of the Chamber of Commerce, Xing Wan of the Municipal Education Association. Master of Ceremonies: Zhang Hanyun. Recorders: Du Mengsen, Wang Guoping. Order Keepers: Ren Bin, Xia Weiqing, Li Qingxiang, Lu Yuanhu, etc. Reception: Zhou Guoping, Li Weihan, Li Shisong, Li Ziyang, etc. The Public Security Bureau band participated in the Qin music, and the police from the Jiaomiao Road Police Station maintained order.</p>
<p>Opening Order</p>
<p>(1) All stand at attention; (2) Play music; (3) Sing the party song; (4) Bow three times to the national flag, the portrait of Sun Yat-sen, and the portrait of Confucius; (5) The chairman respectfully reads Sun Yat-sen's will; (6) The chairman reports on the significance of commemorating Confucius; (7) Speeches; (8) Play music; (9) End of ceremony.</p>
<p>Pan's Speech</p>
<p>After performing the ceremony, Chairman Pan Gongzhan delivered an opening speech, briefly stating that at a time when the international situation is extremely tense and a world war is imminent, and when China's national crisis is even more severe, commemorating our sage Confucius has profound significance. Confucius' most important advocacy throughout his life was "Great Harmony" and "Peace." War is the most brutal act of mankind, but today's world powers are exhausting their efforts to expand their military might to protect their names and invade in reality. Therefore, only Confucius' spirit of peace and his doctrine of Great Harmony can save this crisis. If Confucius' teachings can be widely practiced in the world, the slaughter of humanity can be avoided, and international peace can be expected. Confucius had a spirit of learning, so he was erudite, and his erudition cannot be compared to that of modern people. This is also something that we should admire.</p>
<p>Representative Speeches</p>
<p>After the chairman's report, Zhang Xingwan delivered a speech, briefly stating that although the Zhou Dynasty was a patriarchal feudal society, Confucius' doctrines were able to be implemented. Confucius said that the Dao is not far from people, and also said that Heaven's mandate is human nature, and following human nature is the Dao. Therefore, we can know that this is the driving force for social evolution. Now it is the Republic of China, and the Dao advocated by Confucius is still applicable. We must learn from Confucius and have three prerequisites: (1) a love of learning, (2) diligent practice, and (3) a sense of shame, which is the implementation of wisdom, benevolence, and courage, etc. Finally, Sun Deyu, a representative of the Huiling Guoxue Society, gave a speech entitled "Respect Confucius' Dao to Save People's Hearts." The original speech was very long and is omitted here. The ceremony then concluded and the attendees dispersed.</p>

<h3>From September 1st, Guangdong Customs Will Levy Full Tax on Imported Foreign Rice, Large Quantities of Ke Xian Rice Shipped to Guangdong, Daily Transshipments from Shanghai Reaching 20,000 Bags, Japanese Merchants Reduce Wheat Purchases, Cake Exports Increase Sharply</h3>
<p>After the resolution of the Guangdong political situation, the Ministry of Finance thoroughly reorganized the province's economy and finance. The Guangdong Customs was also ordered to levy a full tax on imported foreign rice starting from September 1st. Large quantities of domestic Ke Xian rice have been shipped to Guangdong in recent days. Japanese merchants have reduced their purchases of wheat, and bean cake exports to Japan have increased significantly. The details are recorded by a reporter from Dagong News Agency as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong Customs Will Levy Tax on Foreign Rice from September 1st</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance increased the import tax on foreign rice and wheat on December 16, 1933, the two provinces of Fujian and Guangdong were not taxed at that time due to environmental reasons, resulting in a failure to unify tax collection. Subsequently, the Fujian situation was resolved, so the Fujian Customs also followed the ministry's order to start levying taxes. However, the obstruction of local governments in Guangdong Province for several years has made it impossible to implement, causing foreign rice imports to double, accounting for the first place in the import surplus of various goods. After the Guangdong political situation was settled, the central government thoroughly reorganized the province's economy and finance. In order to increase national treasury revenue, the Ministry of Finance ordered the Guangdong Customs to levy a full tax on imported foreign rice starting from September 1st. In order to compensate for the losses of merchants who have already ordered foreign rice, it is stipulated that foreign rice ordered before August 10th will still be tax-free with the bill of lading, foreign rice ordered with the bill of lading after August 10th will be taxed at half rate, and foreign rice ordered on September 1st will be taxed at full rate.</p>
<p>Large Quantities of Domestic Ke Xian Rice Shipped to Guangdong</p>
<p>With the Guangdong Customs set to levy a full tax on imported foreign rice soon, the price of foreign rice will be higher if the cost is combined. Therefore, the Ke Zhuang rice shops in Shanghai stationed in Guangdong and Shantou have no choice but to purchase domestic rice. According to the Dagong News Agency reporter's investigation with the rice industry groups in this city yesterday, more than 20,000 bags of Ke Xian rice, which are transshipped from Hankou, Wuhu, Changsha and other places to Shanghai and then transshipped to Guangdong through the South China line ships, are shipped daily. Some merchants in this city will set up Zhuang shops in Guangzhou and Shantou to facilitate commercial transactions and handle trade between Shanghai and Guangdong.</p>
<p>Cake Exports to Japan, Wheat Decreases</p>
<p>Yesterday, a Dagong News Agency reporter conducted a survey in the local miscellaneous grain market. Japanese merchants purchased a large amount of our country's new wheat during the new wheat season last month. Because the moisture content of the new wheat had not dissipated, it had rotted after being shipped to Japan, resulting in heavy losses. Therefore, Japanese merchants have reduced their purchases. As for bean cake and bran, etc., 100,000 pieces have been exported to Tokyo, Kobe and other places in Japan in the past half month. These cakes and bran are all used as fertilizer for farmland.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu and Zhejiang Silk Merchants Stop Releasing September Futures, Export Merchants Have Not Yet Agreed to the Silver-Goods Exchange Method, Zhejiang Silk Factory Association Yesterday Sent Letters to Members for Compliance</h3>
<p>Since the joint meeting of the Zhejiang, Wuxi, and Shanghai silk factories decided to abolish the previous method of collecting money for export merchants' transactions and change to silver-goods exchange, and it was scheduled to be implemented from September 1st, export merchants have not yet expressed their agreement to this method. The silk merchants have decided to temporarily stop releasing September futures. The Zhejiang Provincial United Silk Factory Committee specially sent letters to the member silk factories yesterday to take a unified step. The original letter read, "Dear Sir/Madam, the member meeting was convened in Hangzhou on the 23rd of this month. Among the resolutions of the joint meeting of the Zhejiang, Wuxi, and Shanghai Silk Factory Association, the tenth resolution abolishes the previous method of collecting money. After the inspection is completed, the silver-goods exchange will be based on the publicly weighed certificate, which will be implemented from September 1st. The case of temporarily stopping the release of September futures before the export merchants express their agreement was submitted for discussion, and it was resolved that the interests of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang counterparts are the same and a unified step should be taken to show unity. However, in special circumstances, those who have solid guarantees and pay deception and must make changes without reluctance, each person is responsible and does not involve the entire action, etc. are recorded in the minutes.

<p>According to the New Voice Society, the meeting of Japanese Consuls-General stationed in South and Central China, led by Mr. Ota, an official from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was held yesterday morning starting at 10:00 AM in the embassy office on the second floor of the Japanese Consulate on Huangpu Road, after Mr. Ota arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin the day before yesterday. (Although it was Confucius' birthday yesterday and the Japanese Consulate was closed, the meeting was held as scheduled, and the rumor that it was a preparatory meeting is inaccurate.) Consul-General Suma stationed in Beijing, along with Consul Matsumura, arrived by car from Beijing around 7:00 AM yesterday. Attendees included Ota, Wakasugi (Shanghai), Suma, Nakamura (Guangdong), Miura (Hankou), Matsumura, Fukui, Terasaki (Consuls stationed in Shanghai), Horiuchi, who has not yet taken office as Consul-General in Tianjin, Shimizu, the Chinese language advisor to the embassy, Yoshioka, the head of the intelligence department, and Ogihara, the secretary (who accompanied Kawagoe north and returned to Shanghai from Qingdao the day before yesterday). The meeting was chaired by Wakasugi and adjourned at 12:00 PM for lunch. It resumed at 1:00 PM in the afternoon and concluded around 4:00 PM. The meeting is scheduled to last for three days, including today and tomorrow in addition to yesterday. It is said that yesterday's meeting began with an exchange of views on the Chengdu incident, followed by Ota conveying the intentions of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the proceedings of the North China Consular Conference according to the pre-arranged agenda. However, the detailed content is being kept strictly confidential by the Japanese embassy and is impossible to ascertain. Regarding Kagesa, the head of the Manchuria-Mongolia section of the Japanese Army Ministry, after arriving in Shanghai from Qingdao the day before yesterday, he paid a visit to Kita, the military attaché of the Japanese embassy, and then visited Kita again at his residence on Wuding Road yesterday morning and afternoon to continue conveying the intentions of the Army Ministry and report on the North China Military Attaché Conference. Utsunomiya, the military attaché stationed in Shanghai, also participated in the meeting. According to information from the Japanese embassy, the army will not convene any military attaché conferences; Kagesa and Kita will simply hold discussions. As for the navy, there is no need to convene a military attaché conference in Shanghai again, as Nakamura, the representative of the Navy Ministry, has already returned to Japan via Tianjin. Ambassador Kawagoe was originally scheduled to leave Qingdao for Shanghai on the Dalian Maru yesterday afternoon, but the Japanese embassy received a telegram yesterday stating that the ship was delayed due to a typhoon and would depart from Qingdao at 7:00 AM this morning. It is estimated that it will arrive in Shanghai around 10:00 AM tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>Agricultural and Fishery Election Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the agricultural and fishery units held an election of delegate candidates at the Municipal Agricultural Association. 104 executive members from 14 district agricultural associations and one municipal fishery association attended. Huang Ti-ru was sent by the National Election Office as a voting supervisor, and Yang Shui-ruo and Zhou Bo-hua were voting administrators. Upon presentation of citizen identification cards and certificates of association membership, each person was issued a ballot. According to law, each person filled out the ballot with double-signed names, selecting four people, and deposited it into the ballot box, which was properly sealed. The ballots will be counted on a later date, and three times the required number of candidates will be recorded, compiled into a list, and submitted to the General Office for forwarding to the National Government for final selection.</p>
<p>Agricultural and Labor Union Members Take Oath</p>
<p>Yesterday, over 80 labor union members throughout the city separately took the citizen's oath and registered at their respective union offices. Yang Jia-lin and others were sent by the office to attend and supervise the oath-taking ceremony, which was presided over by the chairman of the standing council of each union. The oath-taking ceremonies for the members of the district agricultural associations and fishery association are scheduled for tomorrow (the 29th) at their respective association offices. It is expected that around 10,000 people will participate.</p>

<p>Free Professionals Elect</p>
<p>The election of candidates for representatives from free professional groups was originally the responsibility of the General Supervisor of Elections for Free Professional Groups. However, the Municipal National Election Office has repeatedly received telegrams from the General Office and the General Supervisor of Elections for Free Professional Groups, entrusting the election affairs to the election offices of various provinces and cities for convenience. The necessary ballots have also been requested to be handled on their behalf. Therefore, the office has scheduled separate elections.</p>
<p>Accountants Elect Representatives</p>
<p>The election of candidates for representatives from the accountants' free professional group is scheduled for tomorrow at 10:00 AM at the association on Hong Kong Road. All 15 executive committee members of the association who have taken the citizen's oath and registered will participate in the election, with each person electing five candidates.</p>

<h3>Local Court Sentences in Gun Theft Case; Wang Xiao A-yu Sentenced to Four Years and Six Months</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Local Court was broken into on the night of May 9th of this year. The seals on the storage room for stolen goods were destroyed, and twenty confiscated new-style handguns and a radio were stolen. The Local Court issued an arrest warrant, and the Yulin Road police station detectives arrested the bandit Wang Xiao A-yu. According to his confession, they arrested Wang Shi, a female bandit in the French Concession's Zhu-jia-qiao, who was hiding the stolen guns, and seized twelve handguns. She was transferred to the Municipal Public Security Bureau. She confessed to conspiring with Chen A-san, a dismissed public servant, to commit the theft. They were immediately sent to court for investigation and trial. After investigation by Prosecutor Xie Lian, no organized accomplices were found. The suspect was evasive, so Wang Xiao A-yu was publicly prosecuted for theft under Articles 321, Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Criminal Code, and Wang Shi was prosecuted for receiving stolen goods under Article 349, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code. After repeated hearings by the criminal court and various methods of inducing confession by court police in disguise, all proved ineffective. This case could only be concluded based on this partial interrogation. Yesterday, Judge Chen Kang-sun opened the court and brought the defendants to the dock. After briefly questioning their ages and origins, the court sentenced Wang Xiao A-yu to four years and six months of imprisonment for jointly breaking into and stealing at night, and Wang Shi to one year of imprisonment for receiving stolen goods.</p>
<h3>One Man and Two Women Convicted of Drug Offenses; Yang Jin-sheng and Xu Chen-shi Each Sentenced to Two Years; Cai Wang-shi Sentenced to One Year and Six Months</h3>
<p>Jin Hai-bo and Ji Pei-quan, Chinese detectives from the Hongkou and Huishan police stations, arrested Jiangbei resident Yang Jin-sheng, Huzhou woman Cai Wang-shi, and local woman Xu Chen-shi between 1:00 PM and 8:00 PM on the 22nd of this month at 545 Feilun Road, 85 Burton Road, and 45 Yuanfang Road respectively for consuming heroin as a substitute for opium. The suspects, along with Jiangbei resident Dai Sha-zhen, who was also suspected, as well as heroin, small opium pipes, and candles, were taken to the police station, detained separately, and sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation. They were remanded in custody to await sentencing. The day before yesterday, Judge Zhong Qing presided over the Third Criminal Court, sentencing Yang Jin-sheng and Xu Chen-shi to two years of imprisonment each, and Cai Wang-shi to one year and six months. Before serving their sentences, they were sent to the drug rehabilitation hospital for up to one month of cautionary punishment. The evidence was confiscated as per the list, and Dai Sha-zhen was released.</p>
<h3>Restaurant Industry Held Meeting Yesterday; Proposed Amendments to Eliminate Extra Tips</h3>
<p>The restaurant industry in the city, under the order of the New Life Movement Association, held an executive committee meeting yesterday afternoon, presided over by Zhu Li-gong, to discuss the elimination of extra tips. As a result of the discussion: (1) Regarding the New Life Movement Promotion Association's draft implementation measures for eliminating extra tips in the city, it was decided to add opinions, explain the difficulties, and request a postponement or careful consideration, as the conditions of various industries in the city are different, and separate detailed rules must be formulated for each industry to avoid disputes. (2) Regarding the re-election of the association, it was decided to: (a) submit a draft amendment to the constitution to the general meeting; (b) increase the number of supervisory committee members by seven. (3) Regarding the solicitation of members, it was decided to send a letter to Standing Committee Member Li requesting the assistance of aviation donation collectors. (4) Regarding the selection of a preparatory committee for the re-election, it was decided to appoint Ye Qi-chang, Cheng Ke-fan, Zhu Li-gong, Shao Shu-wei, Shao Yi-fen, Li Man-cun, Hu Yuan-tang, Huang Han-liang, Shao Yue-run, Zhang Wei-tong, Shao Yue-ting, Shao Yi-wei, Shao Ping-you, Hong Yao-zhang, and Xu Shu-zi as members of the preparatory committee.</p>
<p>The association's measures for eliminating extra tips (original text omitted) were amended as follows: (1) Request that the Chinese and Concession areas implement the measures simultaneously. (2) Because there is no fixed standard for wages in various industries, it is impossible to handle them on behalf of the businesses. Each business should determine its own wages. The general association's notice and implementation measures seem to contradict each other and do not stipulate the setting of wages on behalf of the businesses. (3) In this autumn of economic depression, various industries are struggling to maintain their livelihoods. If implemented, it will inevitably cause serious disputes and seems to contradict Item 3 of the general association's notice. The industry has never solicited extra tips from customers; gratuities given by customers are not restricted. It should be changed to "The punishment for adding an extra tip: each business should follow its original good practices, and employers and employees should freely negotiate." (4) The association's member businesses do not have the practice of requiring employees, except for cashiers, to pay security deposits. They should not be compared with other industries. (5) The association's member businesses' employees are absolutely prohibited from extorting extra tips from customers in the future. Once verified, they will be punished together, regardless of the store. (6) None. (7) Item 5 of the principles promulgated by the general association is in great contradiction with the aviation donation, which goes beyond the scope of eliminating extra tips. It should be absolutely deleted and changed to "After the implementation of the notice on eliminating extra tips, voluntary and legal donations from customers should not be restricted." (8) Postpone implementation until an agreement is reached with the board of directors of the Special District Public Works Department to avoid disputes. (9) Because restaurants mainly use fresh goods daily, and the market prices for fish and fresh goods vary daily, specifying prices within the scope of eliminating extra tips is clearly presumptuous. It should be deleted, and each industry has its own different conditions. Separate detailed rules must be formulated. "It is more appropriate to change it to 'During the trial period, separate detailed rules for implementing the elimination of extra tips will be formulated for each industry.'" (10) None.</p>
<h3>City Center Fire Brigade to Hold Inauguration Ceremony on September 1st at 9:00 AM</h3>

<h3>Majority of Public Concession Complies with New Weights and Measures; Public Works Department Responds to Letter from Fresh Meat Industry</h3>
<p>According to the Da Gong News Agency, the Special District Branch of the Municipal Fresh Meat Industry Association previously sent representatives to petition the Public Works Department and sent a letter to the Department's Health Bureau requesting assistance regarding the ban on the use of steelyard balances. The association received a reply from the Health Bureau yesterday stating: "We have received your letter of the 7th requesting the ban on the use of steelyards and old scales. The Bureau hereby replies as follows: In the Public Concession, generally, noodle shops, restaurants, and food stores have now complied with the orders of the Chinese government and changed to new weights and measures, accounting for nearly 80%. Only a small number of stores still use old scales. All vendors in the vegetable market have also complied with the new system. Regarding the discovery of any stores or citizens within the Concession using old steelyards, the Bureau has no right to interfere or force them to change to new weights and measures. However, it is comforting to your association that the implementation of this new system of weights and measures has been welcomed by the citizens of your country, and the future will surely be smooth. This is a reply from the Health Bureau of the Public Works Department to the First Special District Branch of the Shanghai Fresh Meat Industry Association."</p>
<h3>Preventing Autumn Tides: Raising Low-Lying Roads; Zhejiang Road Has Been Raised by Over a Foot; Preventing Moisture in Rice and Wheat Warehouses</h3>
<p>Every autumn, the Huangpu River has high tides. Because of the many sewers in the city, there is often a risk of flooding in low-lying areas during high tides. Rice and wheat warehouses on both sides of the Suzhou Creek are also at risk of being flooded. As the high tide season approaches, low-lying areas have been raised. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Raising Low Roads</p>
<p>Zhejiang Road and Nanjing Road are busy areas in the city, but they are prone to flooding during autumn tides due to their low elevation. Recently, the Engineering Department of the Public Works Department, in coordination with various businesses, raised the doorsteps in front of the stores. Zhejiang Road and Nanjing Road have been raised by over a foot, and various stores are carrying out storefront renovation projects, most of which have been completed. The foundation of the new Wing On Company building is three feet higher than the original, and a stone slope along the street has now been built. The streetcar tracks on low-lying roads such as Zhejiang Road and Hubei Road will also be raised in the near future.</p>
<p>Warehouse Flood Prevention</p>
<p>Due to the low elevation of various roads along the Suzhou Creek, warehouses have been at risk of flooding during heavy tides in recent years. It is understood that banks and major Chinese manufacturers have accelerated the construction of many flood prevention projects in warehouses containing goods such as yarn, cotton, flour, etc. The interiors can be freely dismantled and are not restricted. They are installed during high tides and removed during low tides, which is very beneficial for flood prevention.</p>

The Japanese authorities took this action because the regulations regarding the sale of narcotics and poisonous drugs by Japanese residents in China, formulated in 1928, had many significant shortcomings. Therefore, they were amended and ordered the Japanese consuls in various places in China to comply with the new regulations.</p>

<h3>Robbery Case at Zhou Xi-tao's Home on Hart Road; Thieves Apprehended; Part of Stolen Goods Recovered; Defendants Partially Confess</h3>
<p>At 10:30 AM on the 21st of this month, Zhou Xi-tao's home at 264 Lane 5 Hart Road was broken into by bandits who used guns to threaten and prevent any outcry.

<h3>Two Cases of Bouncing Checks in the Dancing Industry</h3>
<p>Saint Anna</p>
<p>The Saint Anna Dance Hall, located at No. 80 Xieqiao Lane, Jing'an Temple Road, is owned by Wang Xinhe. In April and May of this year, the dance hall's piano was damaged, so it was entrusted to the Xiangxing Piano Store at No. 471 Tifei Road, French Concession, for repair. The price was 51 yuan, for which Wang Xinhe issued a check from the Zhejiang Industrial Bank. However, when the check matured, it could not be cashed. The Xiangxing Piano Store then appointed Huang Mingzhang as its legal representative and hired lawyer Xu Guowei to file a lawsuit with the First Special Court, accusing Wang Xinhe of issuing a bouncing check. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Daxi presided over the hearing in the Fifth Criminal Court. Because Wang did not appear and the reason for the bounced check was unclear, he ordered a postponement to investigate and verify.</p>
<p>Yang Changlin</p>
<p>Yang Changlin, a socialite at the Vienna Dance Hall, opened the Vienna Joint Business Company at No. 1112 Qinyuan Village, Xinzha Road. Recently, Li Ziyu, the owner of Yong'anxiang Glass Store at No. 351 Xihua Road, hired lawyer Lin Qing to file a lawsuit with the First Special Court, accusing Yang Changlin of issuing a bouncing check. The check was from the China Industrial Bank, two checks for 150 yuan each, totaling 300 yuan.

<h3>Yuan Zhuxuan's Opium Addiction Has Been Cured; Exemption from Abstinence Granted; Request to Exempt from Criminal Punishment Denied</h3>
<p>Gu Zhuxuan, a native of Yancheng and former head of the Jianghuai Association at the Qinchuan Stage, was implicated in the Tang Jiapeng assassination case. The French police arrested him on September 10 of last year and transferred him to the Second Special Court for prosecution. On October 28 of the same year, he was sentenced to 15 years in prison and 10 years of deprivation of civil rights. Gu was dissatisfied and appealed to the Third High Court. Later, a prisoner accused Gu of smoking opium in the Guangci Hospital's external prison ward. The French Police Department filed a public prosecution and sentenced him to eight months in prison. Gu was also dissatisfied and appealed to the Third High Court. After a joint hearing by the High Court, on June 28 of this year, Gu Zhuxuan was found not guilty of inciting murder, the original sentence was revoked, and the eight-month prison sentence for smoking opium was upheld, along with one year of deprivation of civil rights and two months of mandatory abstinence. After the final judgment, the Third High Court sent Gu to the Second Special Prison on July 15 to serve his sentence. However, the French Police Department expressed dissatisfaction with the Third High Court's verdict of not guilty in the murder case and, in accordance with the agreement, requested the Third High Court Prosecutor's Office to appeal to the Supreme Court. Gu submitted a petition to the Third High Court Prosecutor's Office while in prison, requesting exemption from mandatory abstinence and exemption from criminal punishment. After receiving the petition, the Third High Court Prosecutor's Office requested the Criminal Court and consulted the Institute of Forensic Medicine to send forensic doctors to the prison to assess whether Gu Zhuxuan had an opium addiction. This has been reported in the newspapers. It is now known that Wu Tingqi, the Chief Judge of the Third High Court Criminal Court, together with judges Liao Pei and Wang Yue, reviewed the Prosecutor's Office's request and the Institute of Forensic Medicine's assessment report. They considered that the request for exemption from mandatory abstinence should be granted because the Institute of Forensic Medicine's assessment showed that Gu Zhuxuan no longer had an opium addiction. As for the request for exemption from criminal punishment, because Gu Zhuxuan smoked opium in the external prison ward, his malice was deep, which was not in accordance with the provisions of Article 88, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law, it should be rejected. The ruling was issued and the police were dispatched to deliver the ruling to Gu Zhuxuan the day before yesterday. However, Gu's prison sentence for the opium case will expire on January 12 of next year. It is said that Gu feels that life in prison is too bitter and has instructed his family to hire a lawyer again to seek legal relief.</p>
<h3>New Foreman Kidnapped at Chinese Battery Factory; Old Foreman Resentment Suspected; All Suspects Handed Over to the Public Security Bureau</h3>
<p>At the Chinese Battery Factory, No. 26 Dongjiazhai, Beibaoxing Road, Zhabei, the old foreman, Zhu Yichen, a 30-year-old native of Yangzhou, resented the new foreman, Xiao Shunquan, due to the recent change of foremen. A few days ago, he colluded with Wu Jinyang and beat Xiao Shunquan's brother, Xiao Shunkun, causing injuries. The assailant, Wu Jinyang, was detained and sent to the bureau for interrogation. Zhu Yichen escaped and was not caught. On the morning of the 24th, at 10:00 AM, he colluded with Yang Ziliang, Huang Chenglin, and others to kidnap Xiao Shunquan and confine him in Room 78 of the Dahua Hotel in Xixinqiao, threatening Xiao to return to Yangzhou quickly and not to work in Shanghai. Zhu did not make any statement and was not allowed to be free. Hu Guoguang (46 years old, native of Yangzhou), the manager of the Chinese Battery Factory, reported the kidnapping and disappearance of foreman Xiao Shunquan and requested the North Station Branch Bureau to investigate. Liang Fuchu, the chief of the branch bureau, dispatched the Criminal Investigation Team Leader Gu Liancheng and Guo Mengqu, leading the detectives Gao Song and Hu Kui Sheng, together with Zhang Yuanqing, the Chinese detective of the Laoza Gate Police Station, to search various hotels but found no clues. It was not until around 8:00 PM on the 26th that Yang Ziliang and Huang Chenglin were found on Baoshan Road. When Yang and Huang's accomplices learned of their arrest, they released Xiao Shunquan. The police took him to the bureau for questioning and learned the details. Zhu Yichen was subsequently arrested. After questioning, because the case involved injury and kidnapping, he was handed over to the bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Xinzha Detective Squad Smashes Trafficking Gang; Rescues a Woman from the Gang's Den; The One Willing to Be Trafficked Is a Termite</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 3:00 PM, Mao Gongzhao, the deputy squad leader of the Xinzha Detective Squad in Zhabei, received a tip that the trafficker Tang Along had recently abducted a five-year-old boy named Arong, the son of Jin Ayun, a Shaoxing native who sells Western-style buildings at No. 26 Xieqiao Xieqizi Road, Nanshi, and sold him for money. Deputy Squad Leader Mao immediately reported to Squad Leaders Bao and Qian and led detectives Liu Bingrong and Zang Ding to the scene. They arrested Tang Along at the intersection of Gonghe Road and Haichang Road. After being brought to the team, he confessed to abducting and selling Jin Ayun's five-year-old child and claimed to have received 18 yuan, six yuan of which he used to buy a pair of leather shoes and a new wool hat. He also confessed that his accomplice's den was at No. 10 Yongxiangli, Datong Road. According to the confession, the team immediately went to No. 10 Yongxiangli and arrested an old woman, Gao Zhu, in the back of the hall downstairs. She claimed to be 66 years old and a native of Jiangyin. A woman named Wang Gao, who claimed to be a native of Shaoxing and whose husband, Wang Jinshan, was deceased, said, "Today, Gao Zhu and others called me to introduce me to Wuxi, saying there was a big job to do and that they wanted to marry a widow. They were going to be my matchmaker, but unexpectedly, they arrested me too. It's my bad luck!" After being brought to the team, they arrested another woman, Wu Xu, 48 years old, a native of Shaoxing, at No. 30 Guangdali, Gonghe Xin Road. Xu's husband, Wu Jinlin, 49 years old, confessed that the five-year-old boy, Jin Arong, was entrusted to a hemp-faced old woman in the back building of No. 3 Zhenyeli, Zhongxing Road, and resold to a certain place for a total of 40 yuan. The money was distributed by Gao Zhu's husband, Lao Qi. He and his wife only received a few yuan for shoes and socks. They went to Zhenyeli, Zhongxing Road, but the hemp-faced old woman had already fled after hearing the news. Later, the child's biological father, Jin Ayun, was brought to the case and proved that his five-year-old son, Arong, was indeed abducted by Tang Along at around 7:00 PM on the 25th of the lunar month at the doorway. At that time, he also had a twelve-year-old boy named Aniu, who was playing with Arong at the doorway. Tang called Aniu home to fetch a pot to buy sour plum soup, but unexpectedly, he took Arong away. Tang Along was originally his cousin-in-law, and Tang Along also claimed that Jin Ayun was his uncle.</p>

<h3>Workers at the Second Mayar Factory Still on Strike Yesterday; Workers Insist on Abolishing the Grading System; Party and Government Agencies Will Mediate</h3>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency, after a strike broke out among all the male and female workers at the Second Mayar Textile Factory (leased under the name Heji) at No. 619 Jiaotong Road, Zhabei, the negotiations between labor and management broke down. Management agreed to increase wages, but the labor side also demanded the abolition of the grading system. All the workers continued their strike yesterday. Dagong News Agency reports the details as follows:</p>
<p>The Factory Accepts Increased Wages</p>
<p>After more than 250 male and female workers at the factory went on strike at 3:00 PM on August 25, along with the Ninth Factory in Xujiahui, to demand a general wage increase of one cent per meter and the abolition of the grading system (the Ninth Factory resumed work at 1:00 PM on the 26th after effective persuasion from the factory, and the terms of the agreement were to be negotiated later), the management of the Second Factory, on the evening of the 26th, directly negotiated with representatives of various departments in the factory. As a result, the management agreed to increase the wages paid at 90% of the meter to the full original wage.</p>
<p>The Workers Insist on Abolishing the Grading System</p>
<p>After both sides expressed a resolution on the wage issue, the representatives of the various departments, in order to solicit the opinions of the workers, convened all the male and female workers for discussion at 8:00 AM yesterday, and they all unanimously insisted. The labor and management sides reconvened for a second round of negotiations at 2:00 PM in the afternoon. However, the factory only agreed to upgrade the "B" grade to the "A" grade, while the "C" grade remained the same. The workers insisted that both the "B" and "C" grades be completely upgraded to the "A" grade. If the factory management accepted this, they would have to lose seven or eight hundred yuan per day. In the current sluggish business climate, it was difficult to bear this huge loss, so the negotiations broke down without result.</p>
<p>Workers in Various Departments Continue the Strike</p>
<p>After the negotiations on abolishing the grading system broke down, the workers in various departments left the factory and returned home. Some workers stayed in nearby workshops and continued the strike. Liang Fuchu, the chief of the Zhabei Branch Bureau of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, was deeply concerned that workers would have accidents, so he dispatched several police officers to be stationed at the factory in shifts to maintain order.</p>
<p>Party and Government Agencies Will Jointly Mediate</p>
<p>The Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs attached great importance to the labor unrest. In addition to dispatching personnel to conduct investigations, they will also schedule a joint meeting to convene labor and management and mediate according to law. The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions also sent Bao Boyi to the factory at 3:00 PM yesterday to investigate the truth of the strike and solicit the opinions of labor and management in order to mediate.</p>

<h3>Silk Cocoon Merchants Discuss Purchasing Autumn Cocoons in Zhejiang Province; Autumn Cocoons Will Be Available in Mid-September; Telegram Sent Requesting Crackdown on Fake Cooperatives</h3>
<p>According to Xinsheng News Agency, the silk cocoon control agencies of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provincial governments have successively distributed autumn silkworm seeds to farmers for hatching. Autumn cocoons will be available in mid-September. The Zhejiang Silk Industry Association held a meeting the day before yesterday and invited representatives from the silk factories associations of Wuxi and Shanghai to jointly discuss the purchase of autumn cocoons in Zhejiang Province this year. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Resolutions Passed</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Silk Cocoon Industry Association convened a meeting with the silk factories associations of Wuxi and Shanghai and passed the following resolutions: (1) Due to the yellowing of mulberry leaves this autumn, it is expected that the cocoon quality and silk reeling yield will be higher than in previous years. It is requested that the control commission seriously consider and generously determine the grades during price negotiations to ensure fairness. Resolution: It was resolved to submit a request to the control commission to pay close attention to this matter when negotiating cocoon prices. (2) Cooperative members use the name of cooperation to collect cocoons for profit, avoiding various taxes, which is unfair to cocoon merchants who bear various burdens. How should this be cracked down on? Resolution: It was resolved to submit a request to the control commission to strictly review whether cooperatives are legitimate and to formulate supervision methods to prevent abuses. (3) The abundance of cocoons varies from place to place, and it is difficult to obtain accurate figures in advance. The registered amount of cocoon collection should be based on the total registered amount of silk cocoon merchants, not on individual cocoon firms, so that a comprehensive calculation can be made when the cocoon season is abundant or scarce. Resolution: It was resolved to appoint Chen Qinshi, Xu Xingbin, and Zhou Yangsong as three committee members to liaise with the control commission. (4) The improvement fees are increasing constantly, and the silk cocoon industry has not yet recovered. How should we request a reduction or exemption? Resolution: It was resolved to submit a request to the provincial government for approval based on the resolutions of the joint meeting of the silk associations of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. (5) Appoint representatives to negotiate with the control commission on the spring cocoon deduction and price difference compensation methods. Resolution: It was resolved to appoint Chen Qinshi, Xu Xingbin, and Zhou Yangsong as three committee members to negotiate with the control commission. (6) Appoint representatives to the joint office of the silk cocoon associations of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces in Shanghai. Resolution: It was resolved to appoint Chu Huiseng, Zhou Yangsong, Jiang Laixian, Zhang Youyi, Shen Ju, Wang Zhiquan, Hu Jinxiu, and other seven people as representatives of the association to the joint office in Shanghai. (7) The control methods and registration start and end dates for this autumn season should be announced as soon as possible. Resolution: It was resolved to proceed accordingly and telegram the control commission. (8) The Jiaxing Xinxing Silkworm Seed Farm suggested that the control commission arbitrarily reassign silkworm seeds to different counties, causing farmers to lose their faith and the seed farm to suffer unnecessary transportation losses. It requested that the situation be reported for relief. Resolution: It was resolved to forward the request.</p>
<p>Telegram to the Zhejiang Silk Control Commission</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Silk Industry Association telegraphed the Zhejiang Silkworm and Silk Control Commission in Hangzhou, stating, "To the esteemed Hangzhou Silkworm and Silk Control Commission: Our Zhejiang promotes cooperative cocoon drying, aiming to increase the benefits of silkworm farmers. The method is excellent, but unexpectedly, there are one or two opportunists who use the name of cooperation to avoid taxes. They have not completed all the necessary procedures for organizing a cooperative according to regulations and only focus on distributing seeds and collecting cocoons, infringing on the business of cocoon firms and providing no benefits to silkworm farmers. The government suffers losses, which is very inappropriate. Therefore, we hereby telegram to request that such quasi-cooperatives be strictly cracked down on and not be allowed to operate like cocoon firms. First, check the member list and fund and order them to be recorded. On the one hand, allow the local cocoon industry associations to send personnel to supervise cocoon collection, and cocoons from non-members should not be allowed to be purchased to prevent abuses, which is in the public interest. We respectfully telegram."</p>

(2) The association's letter to the silk and satin industry association, assisting in the investigation of the dumping of Zhoucun serge in Shanghai, was approved. (3) Letters will be sent to the citizens' district sub-associations, assisting various industries in investigating smuggled goods nearby at any time.

<p>Police Identify and Apprehend a Child Drug Trafficker: Thirteen-Year-Old Boy Uses Alias Wang Naisheng; Drugs Found in a Shed in Laoyingpan; His Father Detained for Morphine Case and Sent to the Bureau for Interrogation</p>
<p>Wang Xindong, a patrol officer from the Huining Road Police Station in the Nanshi area, led police officers on patrol at 0:10 AM yesterday. While passing Manufacturing Bureau Road, they noticed a boy, about ten years old, riding a bicycle and speeding past. The boy's hurried appearance aroused suspicion. They immediately ordered him to stop, but he ignored them. The police became more suspicious and quickly caught up with him. Upon searching him, they discovered forty-two small packets of morphine. They took him to the station for questioning. He claimed his name was Wang Naisheng, thirteen years old, from Hubei. He said the morphine was given to him by Wang Zhangshi, who lives in a shed in Laoyingpan, to buy on his behalf, with a value of three yuan. The police dispatched officers to search the shed at the aforementioned location and found another fifty-six packets of the same drugs. They arrested Wang Zhangshi and Wu Baokun, along with the drugs, and took them to the station. In total, ninety-eight packets of drugs were confiscated. They sent the suspects and evidence to the Ximen Branch Bureau for strict interrogation. Wang Zhangshi confessed that he was fifty-two years old and from Zhenjiang. The boy was Zhu Naisheng, the son of Zhu Hai, who was arrested in a previous drug case, and not Wang Naisheng. The bureau found that the boy's father had already been arrested for a morphine case and sent to the General Bureau for interrogation. Now, his son was arrested for a drug offense. They prepared a document and, along with the suspects and the bicycle, handed them over to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau yesterday afternoon for further investigation.</p>

<h3>Communist Party Key Members Wang Shunzhi and Over 400 Others Declare Allegiance to the Central Government and Support Unification</h3>
<p>According to Nongcun She, the entire membership of the Chinese Communist Party's "National Ethnic Armed Self-Defense Association" and its "Shanghai Branch" have voluntarily surrendered to the Central Government, support unification, renounced the Communist Party, reviewed past mistakes, and are determined to follow the Three Principles of the People, support the supreme leader, and participate in the work of national salvation. The association has issued a joint declaration as follows: "Joint Declaration for the Voluntary Dissolution of the Communist Party's 'National Ethnic Armed Self-Defense Association' and its 'Shanghai Branch'": With the evolution of the "September 18th" Incident, the crisis of the Chinese nation has reached a critical stage today. Therefore, the fire of defending the motherland has been universally ignited among the people of the whole country, in order to save our precarious country and nation. This has become an inevitable phenomenon and is something that should be done. Our motivation and purpose in joining the Communist Party's National Ethnic Armed Self-Defense Association in the past was precisely this. However, after joining, the reality was contrary to our wishes. In actual action, we realized that the Communist Party's doctrines and strategies are wrong and unworkable. The Communist Party has consistently advocated class struggle and the establishment of Soviet power. Although it has recently advocated the so-called "United Front," organized a "National Defense Government," and an "Anti-Japanese Allied Army," it is ostensibly saying "anti-Japan," but in reality, it is still vigorously pursuing its class struggle and developing the Soviet. The reason why the Communist Party is carrying out a "United Front" and contacting various parties out of power and all feudal warlord politicians is to revive itself and confront the Central Government, so as to destroy the true unification and unity of our country and nation. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the National Ethnic Armed Self-Defense Association has not only failed to carry out the real first task of national salvation, but has also sponsored various destructive actions by the Communist Party, which has depleted the country's strength. Among such so-called "national salvation associations," there are indeed pure patriots, but the so-called "leaders" are completely colluding with the Communist Party, attempting to expand their own forces with this, and playing the role of helping the wicked to do evil. Therefore, we can see that the so-called "United Front" is nothing more than organizing a national reactionary great unity around the Communist Party. This combination is splitting and destroying the true national unification and unity of the whole country and creating opportunities for enemies to invade China. In order to save the country from danger and revive the Chinese nation, we must expose and oppose the sinister plots of the Communist Party and all reactionary groups. The facts are very clear. In recent years, the government has been actively carrying out economic construction, the New Life Movement, military training, and other tasks of nurturing and educating the people, in order to save the country from danger and preserve its existence. The recent Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee decided to organize a National Defense Conference, and the peaceful resolution of the Southwest issue further proves that the Central Government is actively undertaking the task of uniting and resisting foreign aggression. At the same time, since the Southwest Incident, it has inflicted a severe blow on the Communist Party and all reactionary parties. We, considering the above facts, believe that in order to save the country from danger and preserve its existence, the whole country must be united, under the leadership of the Central Government, and with the strength of the people of the whole country, to jointly overcome national difficulties, so that the Chinese nation can be liberated. Whoever attempts to resist the unification of the Central Government is a traitor. Therefore, we resolutely abandoned the influence of the Communist Party, dissolved its organization, and frankly surrendered to the government, leading the members of the pseudo-Armed Self-Defense Association to unanimously pledge allegiance to the Central Government and participate in the true work of national revitalization. This is the meaning of this. Standing on the interests of the nation, we hope that the comrades of the Communist Party and the National Salvation Association will also sacrifice their own prejudices, come to the Central Government, and jointly shoulder the great historical task of saving the country from danger and preserving its existence. Secretary-General of the National General Association of the Communist Party's National Ethnic Armed Self-Defense Association Wang Shunzhi (i.e., Li Hongsheng), Director of the Organization Department and Party Group Secretary Ge Zhiming (i.e., Lao Zhu), Director of the Propaganda Department and Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee Zhang Muhua, Director of the Armed Forces Department Chen Yisheng (i.e., Chen Huairen), Director of the Seamen's Department Wang Alin (i.e., Seaman Wang), Propaganda Officer Zhang Cihua (female), Secretary of the Municipal Committee and Party Group of the Shanghai Branch Wang Fang (i.e., Huang Qingwu), Director of the Distribution Department and Secretary of the Eastern District Committee Wang Zhenxing (i.e., Chen Ke), Member of the Municipal Committee and Secretary of the Central District Committee Zhi Zhi, District Committee Wang Jiufei (i.e., Wang Peng), and District Committee Liu Wan Gong, and 437 others</p>
<h3>Notice from the Bar Association: Litigants Must Not Enter the Rest Room; All Lawyers Must Wear Badges</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bar Association issued the following notice to all members: (1) Dear Members, please note that the lawyers' rest room is specifically designed as a place for lawyers to rest while waiting for court hearings, and is not intended for litigants. The lawyers' rest room of the Shanghai Local Court is already very spacious, but the rest feels crowded. The reason for this is that litigants, witnesses, experts, etc. who are not lawyers sit among them, resulting in messy seats and disorderly order, which is unsightly. In addition to instructing the hall attendants of the room to pay attention and not allow litigants to linger inside, and to dismiss them if they violate the rule, we hereby notify you, hoping that all members will jointly maintain the order of the lawyers' rest room. In the future, do not bring litigants who are not lawyers to sit inside. Even if you need to contact litigants, you should ask them to leave after the contact. (2) Dear Members, we have received a letter from the Registry of the Shanghai Local Court stating: "Dear Members, the gatekeepers of this court have drafted regulations. From now on, members of your association must wear lawyer badges when entering and leaving. If lawyers or clerks come to the court for business, they must first obtain an entry and exit permit. The above measures will be implemented from August. We hereby notify you, hoping that you will investigate and inform all members." With the approval of the 24th Executive Committee Meeting of the Association, we hereby notify all members to take note.</p>

<p>Setting Up a Fake Film Organization to Swindle Money; Leniency for First-Time Offenders; Shen Xingyi and Chen Wei Penalized;</p>
<p>Shen Xingmin (21 years old) and Chen Qu (23 years old), both from Ningbo, along with the absconding principal offender Wang Jinbao, set up a fake film organization at 540 Jian Heng Road between July 29 and the 12th of this month, with the signboard of the Tianer Film Company Preparatory Office and the Tianer Dance Research Society. They advertised in newspapers to recruit dozens of male and female film actors and tea servers, and printed a charter, stating that actors who learned to act and perform on stage could earn a monthly salary of 25 yuan, and tea servers could earn a monthly salary of 8 yuan, requiring a security deposit of at least 20 yuan, attempting to swindle money. The victims included Jiao Ziping from Shandong (learning to act), Zhao Qingxun from Hangzhou, Xia Hengmei, Liu Zhengxiang, and Zhu Ji, who were defrauded of a total of 35 yuan for meal fees, security deposits, and registration fees. After the case was exposed, Hua Detectives Sun Shaokun, along with Chinese constables No. 1967 and No. 1876 from the Huishan Police Station, arrested Shen and Chen successively and sent them to the First Special District Court for interrogation. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. The trial was concluded and the verdict was awaited. The other day, Judge Zhong Qing came to the Third Criminal Court and declared to the two defendants: "Considering that you are young and ignorant and this is your first offense," Shen Xingmin was fined 100 yuan, and Chen Qu was fined 80 yuan. If they were to perform labor service in lieu of payment, it would be calculated at 2 yuan per day. The evidence was confiscated.</p>

<p>(48) Third Day of the Games</p>
<p>August 3rd was the third day after the opening of the Games. The weather was sunny and rainy, but all results were excellent and unaffected. The track and field was still crowded with no empty seats. German Chancellor Hitler still arrived at the venue at 3:30 PM to visit and left at 6:00 PM. The events for the day included the modern pentathlon at 9:00 AM, wrestling at 10:00 AM, track and field (hammer throw preliminaries) at 10:30 AM, track and field from 3:00 PM (400-meter hurdles preliminaries, hammer throw final, men's 100-meter semi-finals, women's 100-meter preliminaries, men's 100-meter final, 800-meter semi-finals, women's 100-meter semi-finals, 3000-meter steeplechase), Danish gymnastics demonstration, polo, modern pentathlon, fencing, hockey, football at 5:00 PM (Italy vs. USA, Norway vs. Turkey), wrestling at 6:00 PM, weightlifting and fencing at 8:00 PM, youth dancing and singing performance at 9:00 PM. The results of the track and field events are recorded below:</p>
<p>Hammer Throw Final</p>
<p>The hammer throw trial competition started at 10:30 AM. Thirty-two people participated. A standard of 46 meters was set for qualification. The official preliminaries started at 3:00 PM. A total of seventeen people qualified. After three throws, Germany's Briesenick was in first place with 55.04 meters, Sweden's Wingerdt was second with 54.03 meters, and Germany's Hein was third with 52.44 meters. The others in the final were Finland's Kuutonen, the United States' Rowe, and Favre. In the final, Briesenick's first throw exceeded 5-8 meters, creating an excellent world record-breaking result, but it was invalidated for going out of bounds. Hein took the lead with 56.49 meters on his last throw. The whole venue cheered, even more enthusiastically than when Hitler entered the venue. Swedish athlete Wingerdt also improved to 54.83 meters on his last throw, but still ranked third. American athlete Rowe also improved, but failed to change the rankings. The results of the top three all broke the Games record of 54.74 meters set by America's McGrath in 1932, but compared with the world record of 57.77 meters set by America's Ryan in 1913, there was still a difference of more than one meter.</p>
<p>(1) Hein (Germany) 56.49 meters</p>
<p>(2) Briesenick (Germany) 55.04 meters</p>
<p>(3) Wingerdt (Sweden) 54.83 meters</p>
<p>(4) Kuutonen (Finland) 51.90 meters</p>
<p>(5) Rowe (USA) 51.66 meters</p>
<p>(6) Favre (USA) 51.01 meters</p>
<p>Hurdles Preliminary</p>
<p>The 400-meter hurdles preliminaries were held at 3:00 PM, divided into six groups. Except for the first group with four people and the fourth group with five people, the rest had six people. The top two in each group were selected. Our country did not have athletes participating. The best result in each group was by Philippine athlete White in the third group, dropping the second place by two meters. White was the hurdles champion in the previous Games. His results have improved rapidly in the past two years. He has great hopes of scoring in this Games. In the fourth group, Germany's Scheele was still in first place in the last ten meters, but because he kept turning his head to look back, he was overtaken and relegated to third place, losing his qualification for the semi-finals, which made the whole venue sigh. The sixth group included American athlete Hardin, who holds the world record (50.6 seconds) and the Games record (52 seconds). He ran with unusually light steps and beautiful posture. In the last sixty meters, Hardin was still in second place, but his pace quickened to the finish line, dropping the second place by three or four meters. It seems that the championship in this event still belongs to him.</p>
<p>First Group</p>
<p>Kovács (Hungary) 53.7 seconds</p>
<p>Bossmans (Belgium) 53.8 seconds</p>

<p>Sixth Group</p>

<p>Gardon (France) 54.6 seconds</p>
<p>100 Meter Semi-Finals</p>
<p>The 100-meter semi-finals were held at 3:00 PM, divided into four groups. The top three in each group were selected. Those who made the list would be guaranteed to score in the finals, so the competition was extremely fierce. In the first group, Owens and Wykoff met. Wykoff started the fastest and led all the way. Owens bravely defended and stabbed, and only took the lead at eighty meters, winning by half a meter over Wykoff. In the second group, Holland's Osendarp, with light steps and no one in his eyes, took the lead. At six meters, Metcalfe arrived like a fly and won by half a meter, taking first place. Germany's Boschmüller lagged behind by one meter and took third place.</p>
<p>First Group</p>
<p>(1) Owens (USA) 10.4 seconds</p>
<p>(2) Wykoff (USA) 10.5 seconds</p>

<p>(6) Sír (Hungary) Eliminated</p>
<p>3000 Meter Obstacle Race</p>
<p>In the 3000-meter obstacle race, the obstacles included hurdles and water pits. When the athletes jumped over the water pits, many could not jump over, causing water to splash everywhere, and some even fell into the water pits, which made the whole venue laugh. The interest was extremely high. The preliminaries were held in three groups at 6:00 PM. Eleven people participated in each group, and four were selected. The results were as follows:</p>
<p>First Group</p>
<p>Dopant (Germany) 9 minutes 28.4 seconds</p>

<p>Tilden's Visit to China May Become a Reality; Tilden Has Agreed to Reduce His Requested Remuneration; 70% of Ticket Sales Will Be Used as Compensation</p>
<p>Tilden, one of the two giants of the world of professional tennis, will visit Japan in October this autumn at the invitation of the Japan Lawn Tennis Association and will also perform in China. He had previously contacted the Shanghai Western Lawn Tennis Association, but the requested amount was too high, requiring the Lawn Tennis Association to guarantee several thousand dollars in ticket revenue. The Shanghai Lawn Tennis Association did not dare to agree, and the matter became pending. It has recently been heard that Tilden has agreed to make concessions in order to promote the sport and no longer insists on the original amount. He recently sent a letter to the Shanghai Western Lawn Tennis Association, willing to receive 70% (seventy percent) of the ticket revenue to cover his expenses. Therefore, Tilden's visit to China is likely to become a reality, which is good news for China's tennis world.</p>
<p>Lin Baohua's Post-Return Interview: Our Country Urgently Needs to Organize a Lawn Tennis Association; The National Sports Association Sending Athletes to Participate in the Davis Cup May Be Rejected According to International Tennis Association Regulations; Lin and Xu's Performance Earned a New Recognition from the European Tennis World</p>
<p>Lin Baohua, our country's Davis Cup representative who has just returned from Europe, had a very satisfactory performance abroad this time and has also been praised by the foreign press. In addition to representing the Davis Cup, Mr. Lin also participated in the Wimbledon and other tennis matches in various parts of England and his results were also very satisfactory. In order to understand the process of our participation in this Davis Cup tennis match and the situation in the foreign tennis world, we made a special visit to Difeng Road yesterday afternoon. During the hour-long conversation, we obtained a lot of news and materials, some of which were very important and interesting. They are written below:</p>
<p>Giving the European Tennis World a New Understanding</p>
<p>The biggest gain from participating in the Davis Cup this time is to give the European tennis world a new understanding of the Chinese tennis world, because very few Chinese tennis stars often go to Europe, while Japanese tennis representatives are active every year. Therefore, the European side did not even know that China has good tennis players. When Lin and Xu competed in various parts of England, many people said, "Are these two Japanese players?" After explaining that they were Chinese representatives, they seemed very surprised that China also has tennis players who play very well. The importance of sports diplomacy can be seen from this. Therefore, it is hoped that participation will continue uninterrupted next year and in the future.</p>
<p>Arriving in France Too Late, Only Practicing for One Week</p>
<p>As for the match against France, arriving in France too late was also one of the reasons for not having a good performance. It was only a week from arriving in Paris to the match, and practice was rushed. As for the French team, they had already started practicing for two months and had two professional tennis players coaching them every day. One of them was Martin Plaa. Before and after the match, they also had two masseurs to massage them. The differences in the situation are so different, and the quality of the performance and the advantages and disadvantages of the situation can also be seen from this.</p>
<p>Zhao Jia Has Made Great Progress, Xu Chengji Seems Inferior to Him</p>
<p>Zheng Zhao Jia has made sufficient progress, but Xu Chengji seemed very flustered in the Davis Cup. Xu's performance was actually inferior to Zhao Jia's. If Lin and Zheng had partnered in the doubles on the second day, they might have had better results. Zheng rushed back to the United States due to academic reasons after the competition and will not be able to return to China for another two or three years. Yu Tianguang, who is studying in the United States, is said to be able to return in mid-October this year. Xu Chengji, who is still in Europe, can arrive here at the end of September, and Cai Huiquan will take the Kang Tuoluosuo wheel back to the country in early September.</p>
<p>(Editor's Note: On the same ship as our country's World Games delegation)</p>
<p>The Subsidy of One Thousand Pounds, Hope to Be Used Well</p>
<p>This year, we even received a subsidy of one thousand gold pounds in ticket revenue for participating in the Davis Cup, which is equivalent to more than 17,000 yuan in national currency. This is also an unexpected event. It is hoped that the Association can use this money to promote tennis. As for the origin of this thousand gold pounds, it is because the International Lawn Tennis Association gathers the income from ticket sales in the European Zone and then distributes it to the countries participating in the European Zone to subsidize their expenses. If Germany can defeat Australia this time and win the match against England, because Germany also belongs to the European Zone, then China may be able to receive another thousand pounds of subsidy.</p>
<p>The Sports Association Sending Athletes May Be Rejected According to Precedent</p>
<p>Another thing that Europeans find very surprising is that China's registration for the Davis Cup was sent by the National Sports Promotion Association. All countries in the world have a National Lawn Tennis Association, but China is the only one that does not. According to people from the London International Lawn Tennis Association, they can actually refuse China's participation because it is not registered by the China Lawn Tennis Association; but because tennis in China is still very young, this is a special accommodation. It is hoped that China can establish a National Lawn Tennis Association in the shortest possible time to promote and support China's tennis movement!</p>
<p>Pan Lai and His Wife's Visit to China Is 90% Likely to Become a Reality; The Only Fear Is That There Will Be No Opponents</p>
<p>The visit of world tennis king Pan Lai to China is 90% likely to become a reality because Pan Lai has personally agreed to visit China in March next year. Pan Lai's wife is a very famous British actress and will also come with him. The most difficult problem for performing in China is finding opponents, so Lin wants to invite the Kramer couple to China as well, but the economic burden for four people is too great, which is a big problem. If it is just the Pan Lai couple, then a few thousand dollars will be enough.</p>
<p>Pan Lai Joining the Professional World Is Only a Matter of Time</p>
<p>How wonderful the skills of tennis king Pan Lai are cannot be described in words. The most important things are speed and power. When the opponent's ball comes, he hits it forward before the ball gets close, without waiting; and the ball that goes out just happens to fly to the opponent's corner. Even if the ball can come back, he is already waiting at the net. Every ball is only half an inch above the net and only half an inch away from the baseline. There are only three people in the world who can compete with Pan Lai: Boche of the United States, Quest of Australia, and Kramer of Germany. Pan Lai becoming a professional player is only a matter of time because he can get 10,000 gold pounds as soon as he agrees, and Pan has also done his best for the British Lawn Tennis Association. Lin said to Pan Lai: "I hope you will join the professional world after you have been to China."</p>
<p>Lin Changed to Learning Pan Lai's European-Style Grip</p>
<p>Pan Lai's criticism of Chinese players is that they cannot make progress without fundamentally changing their hitting method. He also advised Lin to change his hitting method. Lin has changed to learning his European-style Continental Grip. The forehand and backhand do not change. Lin said that it will take six months to see results. This method is extremely powerful for forehand shots. The most obvious point of the world's top players is that their shots are very powerful, as heavy as a thousand pounds.</p>
<p>England Can Only Win the Davis Cup for One More Year at Most</p>
<p>As for the Davis Cup, England can only keep it for one more year at most because they lack young people. The situation in Germany, Australia, and the United States is average. Whichever country produces a second good singles player, that country will change the Davis Cup. According to Lin's opinion, the rankings of the world's top players should be: (1) Pan Lai, (2) Boche, (3) Kramer, (4) Quest, (5) Austin, (6) Crawford.</p>
<p>Competing in Various Parts of England Won Several Second Places</p>
<p>In addition to participating in the Davis Cup and the Wimbledon Championships, Lin also participated in championships in various parts of England: he won the Nottingham singles championship. He also won the doubles runner-up with Australian Kerrigan. He won the Hertfordshire doubles championship, partnered with Siam Chukaphurna; he won the singles runner-up. He won the Surrey doubles runner-up, partnered with Indian Fazzi. He won the Berkshire doubles runner-up, partnered with Kerrigan. He won the Lytham St Annes doubles runner-up, partnered with Hayes.</p>

<p>New Family and Health Edited by Dr. Shen Zhaoquan How Do Backward Youths Cultivate Sound Minds? By DR. BEALE, Translated by Shen Zhaoquan</p>
<p>Youths in their student days yearn for methods to clarify their minds and strengthen their memory, much like starving people seek food. This is akin to the elderly seeking immortality and rejuvenation, stemming from the same psychology.</p>
<p>During adolescence, physiological activities due to the internal secretions of the reproductive organs easily cause sexual anxieties. Mentally, high intellectual desires often lead to indiscriminate reading, further exacerbating these anxieties. The stress during examinations is even more intense. Consequently, about 70-80% of young students today feel the sorrow of neurasthenia.</p>
<p>Neurasthenia is an evil demon that destroys the vitality of youth in darkness! This illness can transform promising youths into pitiful and useless invalids, causing life's happiness to vanish like flowing water—a truly terrifying affliction.</p>
<p>The brain is the origin of the nervous system. Nerve fibers emanating from the brain, like branches, spread to all tissues and organs of the body. All our actions are directed by the brain, with nerves acting as conductors, managing all life phenomena essential for survival. Thus, Gall stated, "Human instincts, emotions, thoughts, genius, desires, and all other moral, intellectual, and spiritual phenomena originate from the brain." From this perspective, the brain is the master of the body—in other words, our lifeline. Therefore, to remedy neurasthenia, it is essential to nourish the brain!</p>
<p>Accordingly, to cultivate a sound mind and eliminate the life-destroying effects of neurasthenia, one should regularly take Memory Neurotic 'Mimir Brain Tonic,' which can strengthen the brain, fortify the nerves, and boost energy. Only in this way can one achieve a clear mind, agile thinking, and strong memory. Apart from this therapeutic approach, any other tonic is a waste of effort, offering no benefit! Doctors worldwide have proven the power of 'Mimir Brain Tonic' in rescuing weakness and nourishing the brain. Surveys from major European and American hospitals report that millions of backward youths have regained health and achieved success after taking this medicine. I have translated this information for my fellow Chinese youths, hoping to help you escape the darkness and find a fulfilling path in life!</p>
<p>No Need to Seek Far for Lung Disease Treatment by Dr. Shen Zhaoquan</p>
<p>For a thorough treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis, it is not always necessary to relocate for recuperation. Climate and air do not have a direct impact on lung disease. The fundamental cure lies in lifestyle changes. Even those recuperating at home can achieve perfect results by consistently adhering to a regimen of fresh air, tranquility, proper nutrition, and appropriate medication.</p>
<p>Pulmonary tuberculosis is a chronic condition. Recovery requires a very long treatment period, involving time off work and significant expense. Therefore, patients should have a long-term plan in place. For less affluent patients, recuperating at home—with slight modifications to the residence to suit fresh air therapy—while paying attention to general hygiene and taking truly effective 'Lung Vitality' Phith Weal (which aids the body's natural healing mechanisms), can yield superior results to moving for treatment.</p>
<p>Recuperating at home avoids large expenses, allowing for worry-free and peaceful recovery. Meals and care are also more comfortable and free at home, which cannot be matched by hospitals or relocation. Consequently, long-term economic recuperation at home is more comfortable. This approach is suitable for the general public and easily implemented. Thus, thorough treatment of lung disease can be achieved through home recuperation—no need to seek far.</p>
<p>Patients must understand that following the principles of fresh air, tranquility, and proper nutrition, combined with 'Lung Vitality' Phith Weal, is the secret to thoroughly treating lung disease. Those who do not understand this principle and seek solutions far away, thinking that relocation alone can cure the disease, are often undermining the defenses against the spread of the disease in their lungs. I have seen many cases where relocation exacerbated the illness or led to death because the fundamentals of recuperation were not understood, especially the importance of rest. Instead of resting in bed, they exert themselves with travel, which inevitably worsens the condition.</p>
<p>How Can Young People Preserve the Capital of Life? By Zhang Yuanzhen</p>
<p>Ah, the vicious habit of masturbation is creating countless tragedies worldwide! It's like someone with a precious reservoir of life force puncturing holes throughout it, allowing the life force to drain away. What would we think of such a person? Yet, many people do just that. They have a vast pool of vitality, but due to ignorance, most of it escapes through leaks! How tragic that so many talented and promising young people are harmed by this habit, unable to fulfill their ambitions!</p>
<p>Hall said, "One drop of semen is worth forty drops of blood," highlighting the importance of semen over blood. Dr. Hall stated, "The secretions (semen) of a young man's testicles are sent by the blood to the heart and then distributed by the heart through the arteries to muscle tissues, strengthening them; to the brain, sharpening thinking, improving judgment, and strengthening will." Thus, semen is not only the foundation of physical strength but also the source of intelligence. Therefore, young men and women who are dissolute are often physically and mentally weak, with dulled intellects, because they have wasted the life capital of semen. They are essentially destroying their own opportunities and happiness in life!</p>
<p>The adverse effects of masturbation are generally neurasthenia and sexual dysfunction. The symptoms and suffering are beyond description.</p>
<p>The remedy for masturbation requires, of course, curbing the expenditure of semen. However, semen that has already been lost cannot be recovered. Only by using tonics can one turn weakness into strength. According to the research and experiments of global medical professionals, the most effective tonic is the WELL TONIC developed by German Dr. Aisen. This product is made by extracting endocrine substances (hormones) from the testicles of strong animals. After taking it, the testicles' semen-producing function is restored, leading to an abundant and vigorous semen supply that nourishes the entire body. Consequently, all the suffering and diseases arising from the wasteful behavior of masturbation or excessive sexual activity, such as neurasthenia and sexual dysfunction, can be readily resolved, disappearing as quickly as snow melts in the spring sun. I must also add that while 'Well Tonic' has the special effects of strengthening essence, fortifying the kidneys, and nourishing the body, it has no harmful side effects, so patients can take it with peace of mind. It is unlike ordinary aphrodisiacs that deceive patients.</p>
<p>When Can a Person with Gonorrhea Marry?</p>
<p>The Citizen Sanatorium, Shanghai, corner of Haining Road and Kenneng Road</p>
<p>"The wedding night and topping the imperial examinations list" are two phrases that capture the joys of life. A talented man and a beautiful woman, surrounded by the congratulations of relatives and friends, have held their wedding ceremony. The sweet days that follow are truly enviable! Unfortunately, before those sweet days have passed, a ruthless demon follows, like a dowry attendant. What is this demon? It is the bride contracting gonorrhea (gonococcus) from the groom, suffering all the pains of the disease. The bride is seen frowning and living unhappily. Initially, due to the embarrassment of a new marriage, she is hesitant to speak up. Later, as the disease worsens, she thinks of seeking treatment. If the medication is appropriate, she can still live a happy life. However, if the medication is inappropriate, the gonococci can spread to the uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and other internal reproductive organs, becoming chronic, recurring, and causing leukorrhea and menstrual disorders such as painful periods, excessive or insufficient menstruation, and neurasthenia. Thus, a pure, flawless, innocent, and lively bride becomes a sick woman suffering from various ailments, and a happy family is filled with unpleasantness. Imagine how painful this is!</p>
<p>Therefore, at what point does a person with gonorrhea become eligible to marry? This question is indeed an important one in modern society. Therefore, before getting married, both men and women who have not fully recovered from gonorrhea (if the pain has subsided but pus or gonorrhea threads are still mixed in the urine, indicating that the disease has not been eradicated) must take the truly effective new drug "918" ANTI-GONO-TAB '918 Gonorrhea Tablets' and undergo long-term treatment patiently. After about a month, send a urine sample to a doctor (or health agency) for microscopic examination. If no gonococci are found, it can be considered completely cured, and they are then eligible to marry! Based on the results of actual trials by various experts, "918" ANTI-GONO-TAB '918 Gonorrhea Tablets' have the excellent qualities of strong bactericidal power, rapid cure, safety, and no side effects, which cannot be compared to inferior drugs that exaggerate and deceive. Women with gonorrhea and leukorrhea should take '918 Gonorrhea Tablets.' If they have also developed menstrual disorders (painful periods, excessive or insufficient menstruation, irregular periods, and qi and blood deficiency), they should simultaneously take the famous gynecological medicine 'Menorrin' internally to regulate menstruation, replenish blood, and enhance beauty, which is quite effective. Now is a time when sexually transmitted diseases are surging, and to maintain a happy family, it is essential to pay attention to this issue!</p>

<p>Family Medicine: Spermatorrhea Treatment by Dr. Li Guoan</p>
<p>Spermatorrhea is often caused by erotic dreams. Young men with aroused spring feelings who have difficulty connecting with women, or those who are physically strong but not yet married, or those who are away from home and unable to sleep with their wives, are prone to this condition. Others are caused by excessive masturbation or sexual activity. Especially young people often have lewd thoughts and masturbate, causing this disease. As a result, they suffer from mental decline, dizziness, tinnitus, headaches, insomnia, lower back pain, limb weakness, and a pale, lifeless complexion. If not treated early or if treated improperly, they will eventually die from weakness.</p>
<p>The treatment for spermatorrhea requires controlling lust, avoiding stimulating foods and drinks, and avoiding excessive physical and mental labor. For medicines to stop spermatorrhea, it is advisable to take 'Folan' Folan Tablets before going to bed at night, swallowing two to three tablets, which is quite effective. Most people can fully recover after taking only one or two bottles. For weakness caused by kidney deficiency, a tonic should be used. 'Well Tonic' has the power to prevent aging and rescue weakness.</p>
<p>Dysentery Treatment by Dr. Xu Liren</p>
<p>Dysentery is most common in the summer and autumn. The main causes are generally drinking unclean beverages or eating unripe fruits. However, it is transmitted through the feces of patients with diarrhea. When this disease first starts, one feels tired all over, has a poor appetite, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, with a feeling of urgency but only passing small amounts of mucus, blood, pus, and other similar stools each time. In acute cases, chills and fever suddenly occur, and the abdominal pain is very severe. The stool is even completely bloody, so the patient's suffering is indescribable. If the patient is not treated properly, they can die within one or two weeks.</p>
<p>For the treatment of this disease, reducing food intake is important. It is best to only use liquid and nutritious foods. For treatment, 'Uyselrin' tablets are the most effective medicine for this disease. Take two to three tablets three or four times a day. Generally, the effect can be seen within twenty-four hours after taking the medicine. Abdominal pain and diarrhea are reduced. Mucus and bloody stools are also reduced. The patient feels refreshed, their appetite gradually opens up, and the chills and fever disappear. They can recover in a few days.</p>
<p>Radical Cure for Asthma by Dr. Wang Wenzhang</p>
<p>Asthma, also known as phlegm asthma, is prone to occur in neurotic people and those with chronic bronchitis.</p>
<p>The symptoms of this disease often start suddenly. The patient has great difficulty breathing, wheezing in the throat, a cyanotic complexion, cold sweats, and cold limbs. Because of the difficulty breathing, the patient often sits on the bed. After several minutes to two or three hours, the attack stops and they return to normal. The frequency of attacks varies. Some have two or three times a month, others have frequent attacks, and still others only have a few times a year. Or they may feel short of breath even on ordinary days and feel short of breath with slight movement. It is generally easier to have an attack when one is overly tired physically and mentally.</p>
<p>For treatment, because there were no perfect medicines in the past, it was generally considered difficult to cure radically. Often, during an attack, anesthetics (morphine and opium) were used to temporarily relieve the pain. However, these anesthetics should not be used frequently because there is a risk of poisoning. Most of the asthma medicines sold on the market contain anesthetics. Although they can take effect immediately, they have the drawback of being addictive. Patients should pay more attention to these medicines.</p>
<p>Now, Germany has invented a new medicine for the radical cure of asthma, 'Holipin.' Based on the results of experiments by doctors in various countries, it has the possibility of curing asthma of various origins. When used during an attack, it generally has the effect of relieving asthma within ten minutes. If you continue to take half a dozen to a dozen tablets during the remission period, you will definitely be able to get rid of the suffering of recurrence. Moreover, 'Holipin' has a mild medicinal property, and its ingredients do not contain any anesthetics. Therefore, it is suitable for long-term use and does not cause any harm. Therefore, doctors in various countries recognize this product as a safe internal medicine for the radical cure of asthma.</p>
<p>Female Fitness Method by Dr. Guo Genxiannv</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the most important sign of a woman's fitness is menstruation. If menstruation comes as usual and repeats regularly, then generally her sexual function is not abnormal in any way. At the same time, it can be known that there is no change in her body. Of course, she is fit and lively.</p>
<p>Normal menstruation means that a woman's body is healthy. If menstruation is irregular, this means that a woman's body is weak. Therefore, menstruation is a measure of whether a woman's body is healthy. I often see young women with pale faces, depressed spirits, and weak bodies. After examination and inquiry, nine out of ten are due to abnormal menstruation.</p>
<p>The symptoms of menstrual disorders are generally pain before and after menstruation, bleeding, and various other secretions—leukorrhea—and most of the lower abdomen and waist feel distended and painful. In addition to headaches, insomnia, stiff shoulders, palpitations, loss of appetite, nausea, constipation, and excessive urination, there is also pain at that time. In addition, there are also dizziness, fatigue, numbness, swelling, a feeling of bloating, general sluggishness, weak sensuality, and pain during intercourse. The conditions of these diseases vary from person to person. The details of these symptoms can be known from the patient's own statements, and there are really quite a few.</p>
<p>The tragic state of young women suffering from menstrual diseases is really unspeakable. It destroys the beautiful dreams of couples and causes discord in the family. Because of mental distress, the happiness of youth and fitness is completely eroded by the pain of menstruation. What a pity. Therefore, menstrual disorders must be treated appropriately as soon as possible, and attention must be paid to recuperation. They must not be taken lightly or ignored.</p>
<p>Patients must keep their minds quiet and avoid all stimulation. They must cultivate their minds and bodies and absolutely not overwork themselves. If it is due to blood deficiency, they must eat more nourishing foods or take "Kang's Vitality" to nourish the blood and restore physical strength quickly.</p>
<p>The most effective medicine for regulating menstruation in clinical practice is "Menorrin." It is unanimously recommended by specialized doctors in various countries. The author has used this product to treat gynecological diseases—menstrual disorders—red and white leukorrhea—etc. with satisfactory results in recent years. All the suffering of women is dispelled in a very short time, and they can restore the joy of fitness.</p>

<p>Commercial News: Food Grains</p>
<p>River Rice Market Continues to Weaken</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the total arrival from all gangs was twenty-three or four numbers, with a total of four thousand four to five hundred shih. Retail sales remained sluggish. The bao wei of the Dalian and Qingdao gangs only handled slightly more than four hundred bags of thin rice. Therefore, the market continued to weaken. Thick and glutinous high-priced rice fell slightly by a few cents. Medium-quality rice was about a few jiao lower. Thin rice with bao wei could still hold steady, but the rest were all slightly close to a jiao lower. Du Yangjian showed a slightly soft color, with no rise or fall except for the bian yuan. A total of six to seven hundred shih arrived from Dongxin. The morning was rainy, and the goods were scarce, so people's hearts returned to firmness and the price rebounded by one jiao. New jian glutinous rice followed with a fresh price.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, eighteen or nineteen numbers of goods arrived from the river. The removal of various goods from the market still moved. The market price broke the</p>

<p>Uterine Endometritis and Its Prevention (Chen Jian) The uterus is an organ unique to women. Therefore, uterine diseases are also gynecological diseases. Among uterine diseases, the most frequently encountered is uterine endometritis. It is caused by microbial infections, or by anemia, chlorosis, miscarriage, masturbation, pinworm invasion, improper hygiene during menstruation and childbirth, excessive sexual activity, etc., all of which can lead to uterine endometritis. Among all microbial infections, gonococcus is the most common, hence the name gonorrheal uterine endometritis. Its symptoms are divided into acute and chronic. Acute cases involve severe pain in the genitals, like labor pains, heavy lower abdomen, frequent urination, difficult bowel movements, chills, fever, and red and swollen uterine mucosa, with leukorrhea that is sometimes purulent and foul-smelling. Chronic cases generally have milder symptoms than acute cases, but often worsen during intercourse or menstruation, with increased leukorrhea. The most important prevention method is hygiene. Daily bathing water and utensils, as well as all related items during menstruation, should be kept clean. Special attention should be paid before and after childbirth. Vaginitis with increased secretion and leukorrhea should be treated early to prevent the disease from spreading deeper into the uterus, which is especially important.</p>
<p>(Editor's note: Father and Son Hospital, No. 64 Ningbo Road, French Concession, Shanghai, sells internal White Discharge Pills and external White Discharge Medicine, which are very effective. Women suffering from leukorrhea and preventing uterine endometritis can take them as directed, and they are invariably effective. Each box is said to sell for two yuan.)</p>
<h3>Differentiation Between Gonorrhea and Non-Gonorrheal Discharge (Xiu De)</h3>
<p>The discharge of white pus from the urethra is commonly referred to as gonorrhea. However, this is not an absolute diagnosis, as urethral discharge may also be caused by urethritis, prostate fluid secretion, or cystitis, all of which have symptoms similar to gonorrhea. Therefore, when pus is discharged from the urethra, it is necessary to distinguish the specific pathogen. To determine whether it is gonorrhea, a microscopic examination is required to check for diplococci in the pus. The presence of diplococci undoubtedly indicates gonorrhea. If no diplococci are found, gonorrhea treatment should not be used. Father and Son Hospital, Ningbo Road, French Concession, Shanghai, has a free examination department. Ladies and gentlemen who suspect they have gonorrhea can undergo a microscopic examination.</p>
<h3>On Leukorrhea in Women (Long Yun)</h3>
<p>Nine out of ten women suffering from leukorrhea are due to gonorrhea. Why is this so? As the world becomes more cultured and transportation more frequent, men residing in cities and towns increasingly engage in promiscuous behavior. They unknowingly contract gonorrhea, often feeling ashamed to admit it or regarding it as a minor ailment, neglecting treatment or stopping before complete recovery. This leads to chronic conditions, and their wives and concubines become infected unknowingly. The most obvious symptom is leukorrhea. Most women endure it in silence, reducing their work capacity, losing family happiness, and facing infertility and childlessness, causing immense suffering. However, to determine whether a woman's leukorrhea is due to gonorrhea, there is no better way than examining for gonococci under a high-power microscope. The method involves smearing the patient's leukorrhea fluid on a specially prepared glass slide and examining it under a high-power microscope. This not only reveals the number of gonococci but also identifies leukorrhea caused by other bacteria.</p>
<p>(Editor's note: The differentiation between female leukorrhea and gonorrhea requires a microscope. Father and Son Hospital, Ningbo Road, French Concession, has a high-power microscope and offers free examinations for both men and women. Any doubts can be clarified with a single examination.)</p>
<h3>Dysmenorrhea (Shou He)</h3>
<p>Menstruation is one of the most important things for adult women to pay attention to. It not only concerns physical health but also affects fertility. Therefore, the depth of color and timing have significant implications. Abdominal pain during menstruation should not be ignored. The causes of dysmenorrhea vary, and the right medication can stop the pain and restore health immediately. I have seen many women with sallow complexions and thin physiques who suffer from dysmenorrhea. Once their condition is cured, their faces glow and they are full of life. Among medications specifically for dysmenorrhea, "Good Relief Friend" is highly recommended. Its quick effectiveness is well-known to gynecologists. It is sold by Dachung Company, 320 Avenue Edward VII, for one yuan per bottle, and it truly has the effect of curing the disease.</p>
<h3>Difficult Menstruation (Jing Zhen)</h3>
<p>There are many causes of difficult menstruation in women. Some are due to oophoritis, others to salpingitis, uterine inflammation, or irregular uterine position. It can also be caused by nerve spasms in the cervix or individual neurological constitutions and hereditary factors. Women suffering from difficult menstruation experience complex symptoms, making it a challenging issue for gynecologists to study. The most prominent and painful symptoms are pain before, during, and after menstruation, which we simply call dysmenorrhea. The pain is like colic or labor pains, radiating to the waist and abdomen, and extending to the buttocks and legs. Some women even experience chills, fever, decreased appetite, fatigue, and confinement to bed. Now, the "Good Relief Friend" tablets sold by Dachung Company, 320 Avenue Edward VII, is the only good medicine specifically for difficult menstruation and dysmenorrhea. It can regulate menstruation and eliminate pain. It can truly be called a good friend of women. Each bottle of one hundred tablets sells for one yuan.</p>
<h3>Gonorrhea in Women (Fu Mei)</h3>
<p>Gonorrhea is caused by the mischievousness of diplococci. It is completely different from leukorrhea, and the treatment methods are also different. Reversing the treatment will be futile. Therefore, before treating leukorrhea or gonorrhea in women, it is necessary to distinguish them with a microscope. Once the pathogen is identified, treatment becomes easier. The most effective treatment for gonorrhea in women is short-wave diathermy. Injections and douches should not be neglected either. (Editor's note: Father and Son Hospital, No. 64 Ningbo Road, French Concession, Shanghai, has extensive experience in gynecology. It has a high-power microscope for free examinations for women. If it is gonorrhea, it is treated with short-wave diathermy, and its rapid effectiveness is always a pleasant surprise.)</p>
<h3>Simple Discussion on Treating Leukorrhea (Xu Chu)</h3>
<p>Eight or nine out of ten women suffer from leukorrhea. Initially, they often neglect treatment. After prolonged delay, they experience lower back pain, fatigue, sallow complexion, and thin physique. However, some cases are caused by gonorrhea, and their symptoms are quite similar to ordinary leukorrhea, but with increased secretion and burning urination. This is a serious harm that can damage the body and cause infertility. If not treated promptly, it can lead to uterine diseases and lower abdominal pain, which is very dangerous. Now, Father and Son Hospital, No. 64 Ningbo Road, French Concession, Shanghai, has two types of medicine: internal White Discharge Pills and external White Discharge Medicine. Their effects are particularly effective, and each type costs two yuan per box. My clinical experience shows that they can quickly eradicate the root cause. I dare to introduce them to readers. These medicines are mild in nature and powerful in effect, capable of treating leukorrhea mixed with gonococci and simple leukorrhea. They are suitable for all ages, including pregnant women.</p>
<p>(Editor's note: Shanghai is too prosperous, leading to frequent interactions between men and women, which can easily result in infection. For a hospital that is honest, reliable, and can effectively eliminate viruses in a short period of time, Father and Son Hospital is highly recommended. The hospital is well-equipped and has rich experience.)</p>
<h3>Leukorrhea and Gonorrhea (Wen Sheng)</h3>
<p>Leukorrhea and gonorrhea are definitely different. One involves diplococcal gonorrhea, called gonorrhea, while the other does not have this bacterium. Nine out of ten women have leukorrhea, and many of them have gonorrhea. When a husband has gonorrhea and infects his wife, the symptoms are similar to increased leukorrhea. However, a stabbing pain during urination is a characteristic of gonorrhea. Yet, some people are infected with gonorrhea and do not feel pain. To distinguish between leukorrhea and gonorrhea, a microscope is necessary. Father and Son Hospital, No. 64 Ningbo Road, French Concession, Shanghai, has a high-power microscope and offers free examinations for women to check for gonococci. If there is suspicion of gonorrhea, an examination should be done to eliminate doubt. The hospital has multiple short-wave diathermy machines, which can treat all kinds of gynecological diseases, especially gonorrhea, with rapid effectiveness. Ladies and sisters, do not miss this good medical treatment.</p>
<h3>Self-Treatment for Uterine Endometritis (He De)</h3>
<p>Uterine endometritis has two types, acute and chronic. It is often caused by pathogenic bacteria. The causes are mostly gonorrhea, puerperal fever, peritonitis, improper hygiene during menstruation, masturbation, etc. Chronic cases are transformed from untreated acute cases. Symptoms: Acute cases initially feel discomfort in the lower abdomen, accompanied by chills and fever. Pressing on it causes pain, and the uterus is swollen and soft. Leukorrhea increases. Chronic cases experience excessive menstruation, and severe menstrual pain before or during the early stages of menstruation. Leukorrhea persists year-round, and mental and appetite are very poor. Women who have been infertile for a long time and miscarry are suspected of having this disease and should seek medical attention and treatment immediately. However, Chinese women are often shy and afraid to speak up. In this case, self-treatment is still an option. The so-called self-treatment refers to the "Internal White Discharge Pills" and "External White Discharge Medicine" sold by Father and Son Hospital, No. 64 Ningbo Road, French Concession, Shanghai. Each type sells for two yuan. Using them for self-treatment is quite effective. I often use them in clinical practice and have even seen cases where the inflammation was cured, the complexion turned rosy, and the joy of having a child was achieved.</p>
<h3>Distinguishing Leukorrhea and Gonorrhea (De Xin)</h3>
<p>There is a saying that nine out of ten women have leukorrhea, meaning that many women suffer from leukorrhea. However, there are two types of leukorrhea: gonococcal and non-gonococcal. Without detailed microscopic examination to detect gonococci, it is difficult to distinguish them. Generally, white leukorrhea is non-gonococcal, while yellow or green leukorrhea is gonococcal, emitting an unpleasant odor that intensifies during menstruation, causing even greater symptoms. Women often experience lower abdominal pain, irregular menstruation, leading to mental depression, fatigue, headache, dizziness, blurred vision, tinnitus, hearing loss, nausea, vomiting, sallow skin, and haggard appearance, resulting in physical weakness, emaciated limbs, infertility, and a lifetime of misery. Therefore, leukorrhea should not be ignored. I often treat leukorrhea in women with White Discharge Pills and White Discharge Medicine, taken internally and inserted externally, with excellent results. Some women have even conceived after their leukorrhea was cured. They came to thank me, and I said, "This is the effect of the White Discharge Pills and White Discharge Medicine."</p>
<p>(Editor's note: White Discharge Pills are taken internally, and White Discharge Medicine is for external use. Their effectiveness is well-known. Each type sells for two yuan. They are sold at Father and Son Hospital, No. 64 Ningbo Road, French Concession, Shanghai. Mail orders from other places require an additional 10% for postage.)</p>
<h3>On Self-Treatment for Leukorrhea (Zhong Wang)</h3>
<p>The most common symptom of female reproductive organ diseases is leukorrhea. Its color may be watery, mucous, thick like pus, or red like blood. This varies depending on the location of the lesion and the severity of the symptoms. Women suffering from leukorrhea feel depressed and uncomfortable all day long. They often experience lower abdominal pain, lower back pain, irregular menstruation, fatigue, headache, dizziness, blurred vision, tinnitus, and hearing loss. In severe cases, the reproductive function is also affected, leading to infertility. Therefore, leukorrhea should not be ignored and left untreated. Eight or nine out of ten Chinese women suffer from this condition, but most are too shy to seek medical attention, delaying treatment and regretting it for the rest of their lives. This is a mistake. In my clinical practice, when female patients with leukorrhea say that they are unable to seek medical treatment due to family responsibilities, I advise them to purchase internal White Discharge Pills for self-treatment. The number of women who have recovered is close to a thousand, and many have even conceived after their leukorrhea was cured. This is truly a good medicine that women should have on hand.</p>
<p>(Reporter's note: Internal White Discharge Pills are exclusively sold by Father and Son Hospital, No. 64 Ningbo Road, Shanghai. Their effectiveness has long been well-known and remarkably effective. Each box of this medicine sells for two yuan. Ordinary leukorrhea is effective with one box. Leukorrhea caused by gonorrhea infected by the husband can be completely cured with two or three boxes.)</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of a Newlywed (Submitted by Xu Zhiming)</h3>
<p>My relative, Mr. Wu, is young and handsome, studying at a university in Shanghai. He is exceptionally intelligent and highly regarded by his teachers. He graduated last summer and held his wedding. His bride is from a distinguished family and works as a trainee at a bank in Hangzhou. A perfect couple, they exchanged vows by West Lake at the Juying Hotel. The guests filled the room, and it was a grand occasion. However, before the honeymoon was over, their relationship fractured because the bride had contracted the terrible disease of leukorrhea, causing her complexion to turn sallow and her spirit to wane. She sought various treatments, but none were effective. The joy of married life turned into days of sorrow. One day, I visited Mr. Wu's house. Due to our close family ties, he told me about the situation and asked for help. I remembered reading in a medical journal that the internal White Discharge Pills and external White Discharge Medicine sold by Father and Son Hospital, No. 64 Ningbo Road, French Concession, Shanghai, were remarkably effective and worth a try. I immediately purchased them and used them according to instructions. Sure enough, in less than half a month, the leukorrhea stopped, and the disease was completely cured. Yesterday, I received a letter from Mr. Wu thanking me for my kindness. Because I believe the medicine is so effective, I am willing to introduce it and ask you to publish it in your esteemed newspaper to express my gratitude. The medicine costs two yuan per bottle.</p>
<h3>Talking About the Ullambana Festival (Wo)</h3>
<p>The Ullambana Festival is a product that arises with the transition from summer to autumn. In Shanghai, regardless of the neighborhood, lane, or village, lanterns are hung, colorful decorations are displayed, and paper money and clothing flutter at the entrances. These seasonal items are a way for Buddhist disciples and idlers to make money. Buddhist disciples cannot thrive without idlers, and idlers cannot be successful without Buddhist disciples. Therefore, during the Ullambana Festival, Buddhist monks are like hourly teachers, leaving one class to teach another, keeping them very busy. However, it is unknown whether poor people benefit from the Ullambana Festival. Those who organize the Ullambana Festival are already content and profitable. According to recent reports, the Suiyuan Garrison Headquarters of Hebei and Chahar will host a Ullambana Festival to commemorate the soldiers who died in battle. It is scheduled to be held at the Tianwang Palace in Beihai on the 31st. At 9:00 AM, Song Zheyuan will preside over the ceremony, followed by sacrifices from military, government, school, and organizational groups. At 6:00 PM, a Dharma ship will be burned to transcend the deceased soldiers. It is appropriate to commemorate soldiers who sacrificed for the country, and military, government, school, and organizational groups should pay tribute. However, whether using the Ullambana Festival and burning Dharma ships is the right way to commemorate and transcend them is a question. This question may seem insignificant, but it is also a strange phenomenon of the abnormal development of North China. Logically, under the rule of the National Government, such superstitious activities should not occur. It is appropriate to commemorate soldiers who died in battle, and military, government, school, and organizational groups should pay tribute. However, the Ullambana Festival should not be used, nor should Dharma ships be burned. This is obvious. Now, the Ullambana Festival is used to commemorate the soldiers who died in battle, which is clearly an action not permitted by the National Government's laws. However, military, government, school, and organizational groups all attended the ceremony, which makes me somewhat puzzled. Originally, we did not fully understand the situation in North China. Even considering the Hebei and Chahar Suiyuan Garrison Headquarters, we must investigate their authority and background. Furthermore, the Japanese are now advocating for the clarification of the North China regime, clearly acknowledging the current covert situation. They insist on erecting a sign that is neither fish nor fowl before settling accounts. Therefore, the Ullambana Festival is a drama that expresses two attitudes: one is to oppose the actions absolutely prohibited by the laws of the National Government, and the other is to support the resurgence of previous corrupt forces. Therefore, the Ullambana Festival should not be seen as a small matter. It is as serious as open gambling and smoking outside the passes.</p>
<h3>The Edge of Death (Li Yinfei)</h3>
<p>—In Memory of an Honest Friend—</p>
<p>After his friend left, Jiaju lazily lay back on the bed. This had almost become a habit. Whenever he had nothing to do or had finished a task, he liked to lie on the bed, close his eyes and meditate, or pick up a book and casually flip through it. The hospital life of the past month had further developed this habit, and he spent almost the entire day lying in bed. The summer sun at noon was fierce. Even the sunlight through the curtains was hot. It was easy to imagine how hot it would be walking on the street. He couldn't help but sincerely thank the friends who came to visit him. He murmured, "In such hot weather..." His fragile emotions surged again, and he felt a trickle flowing from the corner of his eye. Rationally, he closed his eyes, trying to banish all distracting thoughts. The doctor had also advised him to get rid of all distractions, as excessive agitation was not good for his illness. Every time friends came to visit him, they would repeatedly say, "Forget the past! After you recover, you have to start over. We are young and have time to do things!" He engraved these words in his heart and used them to resist whenever distracting thoughts arose. But today, these words seemed to have lost their effect. He clearly heard his friend asking him: "Do you want me to ask Miss Yu to come and see you once? If you want, I can use my influence as a friend to help you." He couldn't remember how he had replied at the time, but now he burst into tears. When the tears ran down his face, he suddenly jumped up and began to repent: "Let the past be past. After I recover, I must pull myself together!" So he reviewed the warm friendship his friends had given him. How should he express his gratitude for these friendships? He just conceptually shouted in his heart: My friends treat me too well, too well. He therefore wanted more friends to visit him, even if they scolded him severely, he would accept it. He really couldn't stand such a lonely, tomb-like sickroom. Excessive excitement caused his face to burn again. He touched his slightly hot cheeks and couldn't help but feel sad again. Supporting himself, he walked to the mirror. The mirror told him that he was just a terrifyingly thin shadow, with protruding cheekbones and sunken eyes. He felt a surge of heat from the bottom of his heart, and his eyes also felt a wetness. He shook his head and sighed softly: "How useless," then walked to the window, wanting to get some wind from the window to dispel his stuffiness. From the window, he could see a lovely green lawn. Because it was noon, there was no one in the yard, and the warm sun brightly shone on the entire yard. Because of the lawn, his illness-sharpened nerves associated him with other places with lawns, and he also thought of swimming pools. In those places, he had left many shadows for her, and now, all he had were those negatives. He tremblingly returned to the bed and tried to suppress the impulsive emotions. At this time, he hoped that a friend would come to see him, and he could fall into his friend's arms, cry heartily, and then confess his repeated repentance. But in the room, besides the white furniture and white sheets, there was only him, a skeleton-like creature. Finally, he waited for the door to open, but it was the doctor who came in. After examining him, the doctor said to him in a kind voice, "You should rest well and stop thinking wildly. See, your excitement has increased your body temperature again." He lowered his head weakly. Finally, struggling, he used his greatest courage to say, "Do I have any hope of getting better?" The doctor replied in a kind voice, "Don't think about the bad things. Your illness is not too bad. If you rest well for a while, you will get better. The most important thing is not to taste pain yourself." He used a grateful smile to thank the doctor, and also added a force to himself: he wanted to live well, and he wanted to make his life more meaningful. The doctor walked out of his room, driven by human sympathy, but couldn't help but sigh slightly: almost all of the left and right lungs were about to rot, he still wanted to live, poor man!</p>
<h3>Flute (Liao Chuxiu)</h3>
<p>It's autumn. Yes, it's autumn. Well, let's write something about autumn. The first thing that comes to mind with autumn is the "flute"; a flute that is not particularly remarkable. The flute is Hu music, and that's probably right. The early Tang Dynasty was the era when the most Hu music flowed into China, but the introduction of the flute was far earlier than the Tang Dynasty. Cen Shen's "Huqin, Pipa, and Qiang Flute" lists two kinds of Hu music, and Qiang was naturally a foreign country at that time. Li Bai's poem "Playing the Jade Flute in the Yellow Crane Tower," "Whose Jade Flute Flies Secretly, the East Wind Enters Luoyang and Spreads Throughout the City," shows that the flute was probably already widely popular in China during the Kaiyuan period. The Tang Dynasty story says that Li Mo, a Chang'an man, was good at playing the flute. He once secretly listened to the famous song "Neon Clothes and Plumed Skirts" by the Liyuan disciples outside the palace wall on a moonlit night. He secretly engraved the shang and gong with his fingers, and used the flute to score it, which was wonderful for a while. This incident has caused me some reverie. On a cool moonlit day, a white-clothed teenager, carrying a long flute, sits alone by the stone bridge of the moat, listening intently and carefully pressing the shang and gong. After the score is completed, suddenly a long flute sounds, clear for a long time, the moonlight pours down, and all sounds are silent. Even the Liyuan disciples in the palace stop singing and beating, tilt their hats and concentrate, and shed tears secretly! Song Zhengming's poem: "Who is leaning on the building at night with a long flute," the flute and the tall building have almost become inseparable things, because the flute sound flies farther from the tall building, because the flute sound appears clearer from the tall building, of course, the tall building and the long flute can only be the "clear resentment" in the high and distant autumn night. The xiao and the flute are both made of bamboo, and are common things in musical instruments. But the harmony of the xiao is ultimately not as passionate as the flute. After all, if I don't take sides, then playing the xiao is suitable for the deep courtyard in the spring moon, and playing the flute is suitable for the dangerous building in the bright autumn moon. The ancients often used the four words "penetrating the clouds and splitting the stones" to describe singing. I think it is more appropriate to use it to describe the long flute. There is often a saying of "flute cracking" in the notes, which may not necessarily be a fact, but when the flute sound reaches the extreme passion, it really makes us involuntarily feel like this. Compared with all musical instruments, the flute inevitably has more sorrow. Because its origin lies in the nomadic Northwest ethnic groups, on the boundless desert of flat sand, the light-colored gravel is illuminated into silver by the bright moonlight of the northern country, countless sheep flocks like white clouds are sleeping quietly, a teenager wearing heavy fur suddenly thinks of another place very, very far away with water and grass, where there is a person with talking eyes, At the same time, he also thought that last year, in the same place, he had ridden a fine horse, carrying a hunting eagle, bow, crossbow, and that group of Han flying generals who were determined to become marquises, fighting vertically and horizontally, a heavy and upright father, and a heroic brother, both fed their blood to the gravel under their feet, and more of their sheep became the delicacies of the Han army, so he picked up the long flute next to him and blew it, he fully intended to use the flute sound to blow away his sorrow, but he knew that his sorrow turned into flute sound and flew up, from clear and secluded to desolate, desolate and passionate, It turns out that he is a person who refuses to shed tears! I am a low-energy person for music, but because of my love, I can actually play the flute. Later, because of my love for Kunqu Opera, I played more seriously. Naturally, living in a city like Shanghai, I dare not play the flute even if I have one, because I have a strange temper. Once I start playing, I don't know when to stop. I must blow it until my eyes are filled with tears, and my breath is so choked that I can't make a sound before I put it down. And what I play is not necessarily a song. Often I play a few sentences of "Mountain Slope Sheep," then "Zhu Feiyun," and then "Hunjinglong." Isn't this a great disappointment to those who specialize in listening to "Peach Blossom River" and "Flower Shadow"? I have a long flute, and I want to take it to a desert and blow it to my heart's content, blow it to the white clouds, blow it to the blue sky, blow it to myself!</p>

<p>Opening Chapter "Xiaoxiang Asking About Illness"</p>
<p>The misty twilight gradually turns yellow. The light breeze rustles with fine rain. The dim Xiaoxiang sound is silent. The desolate, thin bamboo shadow is deep. The amorous Jia Baoyu, a man of love, thinks of the melancholy and sick person.</p>
<p>Straw raincoat dressed well. Holding a lamp, he hurries into the garden. Walking, he has arrived at Xiaoxiang Pavilion. The girl has just finished writing poetry and put down her pen. The maid suddenly reports that the Second Master has arrived. Only see him, dressed unlike before. Baoyu, why are you dressed as a fisherman? The young master hears the words and hurries to inquire. How is my sister doing? Can you eat medicine? Can you eat more food? Recently it has been unclear. If my sister loves this dress, I will send you a set. Lin Daiyu replied, "Why do you need this? The image of the fisherman is nameless." The words came out, and she thought to herself, "Fishermen and fisherwomen should not be mentioned." A blush spread across her peach-blossom face, and she silently lowered her head without speaking. One is, unintentionally said the wrong thing, one is, unknowingly precious, how can you know the love. A dream of the Red Chamber is full of changes. The story of asking about illness in Xiaoxiang. I hate the old man of the moon for not leading the love silk thread. Therefore, medicine is useless, wasting both hearts.</p>

<p>Peony is unique in the flower kingdom. At that time, green leaves and red flowers made the scenery shine. Wealth and nobility were unique, ranking first among flowers. The flower goddess in February. The delicate appearance is different. Once upon a time, the Qing Dynasty was demanding in writing. That poem was also called king. Suddenly, it caused endless disasters. How many scholars died for this. It is a pity that after death, they must be exposed. Do not teach the bones to be buried. Now the country is in trouble. Who remembers the literary men of the past. Wu Meicun, wrote poetry. Was angry for the beauty. Later, Prince Dian, Wu Sangui, bought Qianjin. He did not allow the poem to be deleted and hidden. Therefore, the Qing Dynasty Emperor made a big prison. A piece of paper allowed the execution of many good gentlemen. He pitied the corpse</p>

<p>No one buried the bones. They were scattered in the wilderness. The peony poem is really sad. That foreigner was arrogant. He completely disgraced the literati. The heroes of Yunnan and Guizhou rebelled against the Qing Dynasty. It was also because of the unbearable memory. It is a pity that the ten-character poem. It became a bloody chapter. Purple peony is called the first among flowers in March. He wants the flower kingdom to be called king. Leisurely and quiet. Zhou Zhenyu, Righteous Demon Legend</p>

When night comes, it is a rainy bath. It is even more enjoyable to return barefoot. Autumn wind is easy to get old. The fragrance of hibiscus flowers shines through a round of moon. Suddenly I heard the pearl throat sing. Shihu string moon is full of boats. After touring the 18 scenic spots of Lingyan. Looking up, I saw a green curtain. It is said that the Shijia shop is good at cooking braised fish soup. Since Yu Youren's poetry on the wall, Jiangxiang flavor is better than Yun Zhuan. After autumn, winter comes again. It is the maple leaves of Tianping drunken in frost. The thousands of purples and reds are charming and dripping. It is better than watching flowers in February. Sometimes snow is appreciated in Hugiu. Cold fragrance pavilion leaning on the railing. Bai Mang Mang does not see the lion looking back.

<h3>New Trends in Central Education at All Levels: Actively Promote and Focus on Practicality</h3>
<p>Regarding the new trends in the implementation of education at all levels in various provinces and cities in the coming year (Year 25), the Ministry of Education has outlined its major points below, reviewing its past work (Year 24) and future plans (Year 25):</p>
<p>Higher Education</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education, recognizing the surplus of graduates in liberal arts from colleges and universities and the shortage of talent in practical fields, has decided to limit enrollment in liberal arts and expand practical fields such as agriculture, forestry, medicine, and pharmacy in Year 25 to meet actual needs. The ministry has increased funding to the Northwest Agricultural and Forestry College to 600,000 yuan, allowing the school to add 13 new classes this year, with Xin Shuzhi appointed as the full-time president to focus on development. The establishment of the National Pharmaceutical College has already begun, with classes scheduled to start in September at the former site of the Salt Industry Bank in Nanjing. In addition, efforts to consolidate higher education funding in various provinces and dispatch personnel to review the operations of private colleges and universities receiving subsidies will continue actively. As for the curriculum and equipment standards of various university colleges and specialized schools, the Medical Education Committee, organized by the Ministry of Education, has already established standards for medical colleges and medical specialties in Year 24. The Ministry of Education has now created simplified tables for the remaining institutions, and will continue to collaborate and implement them in stages this year.</p>
<p>Secondary Education</p>
<p>In addition to continuing to compile test standards for secondary schools and improving teacher training methods, secondary education has recently shifted towards vocational education. For new initiatives, 550,000 yuan has been allocated to establish the National Central Industrial Vocational School, and a site has been selected (located in Banqiao Town outside Zhonghua Gate). Departments such as civil engineering, electrical engineering, applied chemistry, and machinery will be established first, with enrollment after the winter break. For existing vocational schools, orders have been issued to hire experts or leaders from the agricultural, commercial, and industrial sectors to form advisory committees to ensure practical training. 300,000 yuan will be used to subsidize excellent secondary vocational schools. Various provinces and cities have already submitted their lists of excellent vocational schools to the Ministry of Education, which will then form a committee to conduct review work. According to the Ministry of Education's survey statistics from last year, provinces and cities will need a total of 3,600 vocational teachers in various fields in the future. Therefore, the cultivation of vocational teachers and the establishment of guidance workshops will also be important tasks in the future. In addition, regarding the training of teachers for nursing and midwifery vocational schools, the Ministry of Education established an office within the Medical Education Committee in Year 24, with full-time staff handling these matters. Therefore, the planning and implementation of nursing and midwifery education have become more convenient and effective.</p>
<p>Elementary Education</p>
<p>This year's revision of the elementary school regulations includes provisions for the appointment, treatment, and protection of elementary school teachers, reducing redundancies with other regulations. This is a welcome development for the entire elementary education community nationwide. The central government's subsidy to provinces and cities for compulsory education is 4.6 million yuan, an increase compared to last year. At the same time, provinces and cities are required to raise more funding for free education than last year. In order to cultivate teachers for the promotion of free education, training courses for free education cadres and teachers will be held separately. Provinces and cities have been ordered to send students to Beijing for the training courses, which are scheduled to begin on September 20th. The training courses will be held centrally by each province and city. These are the general circumstances of the active promotion of compulsory education this year.</p>
<p>Social Education</p>
<p>This year's social education initiatives include the central government allocating 1.1 million yuan for public education, film education, broadcasting education, etc. An electrical education personnel training course has been organized to enable provinces and cities to use film and broadcasting as teaching tools in the future. In addition to editing and improving public reading materials, efforts will be made to ensure that out-of-school adults who have exceeded the age of compulsory education receive remedial education (civic education, literacy education, and self-defense training) in a short period of time. Each county and city should add 20 to 40 civil schools each year, with each school running at least two sessions, each lasting three to six months. Provinces and cities should submit this plan to the ministry for review by September 15th. In addition, the promotion of phonetic Chinese character molds, the continued planning of the central library and museum construction, and the supervision of labor education in various provinces and cities (currently, only Shanghai and Wuxi have established labor education experimental zones, while other zones are still being promoted) are all being handled or are in progress this year.</p>
<p>Mongolian and Tibetan Education</p>
<p>In the past, the lack of teachers and the small number of schools in Mongolian and Tibetan education were undeniable. This year, great efforts will be made to actively promote teacher training and school expansion. Therefore, 448,000 yuan has been allocated for Mongolian, Tibetan, Hui, and Miao education, mainly to train teachers. Normal schools or classes will be established in the ten provinces of Sui, Ning, Gan, Qing, Xin, Kang, Dian, Qian, Chuan, and Xiang, or existing normal schools will be subsidized to help them develop. Elementary schools and affiliated elementary schools will be expanded in the provinces of Cha, Sui, Ning, Gan, Qing, Kang, Dian, Qian, Xin, Xiang, and Sichuan-Tibet. In addition, social education will be promoted in border areas, productive education will be implemented, and funding will be provided to students entering colleges and universities in China. These measures are all practical and will be implemented soon.</p>

<h3>Xu Xingchu Discusses: Sino-Italian Cultural Relations</h3>
<p>Xu Xingchu, the honorary secretary of the Sino-Italian Cultural Association, recently returned from Rome. A reporter from the Shanghai News Agency visited him yesterday at the Shanghai YMCA in Eight Immortals Bridge. Mr. Xu provided a detailed account of the progress of cultural relations between China and Italy in recent years. Excerpts from his remarks are as follows:</p>
<p>Italians Enthusiastically Study Sinology. Mr. Xu said that in recent years, due to the friendly relations between China and Italy, cultural exchanges between the two countries have become closer. In addition, Italians have always admired ancient Chinese culture, and magazines and newspapers often discuss it, leading to a growing enthusiasm for the study of Chinese culture among academics. The organized institutions and groups include the Oriental Institute in Rome (headed by former Minister of Education Gentile), the Chinese Academy in Naples (renamed the Oriental Institute, headed by Congressman Babilleni), and the Oriental Institute of the Royal University of Rome (headed by the famous Professor Falga). All of these institutions have a rich collection of Chinese books, especially the Oriental Institute in Rome, which also has a large collection of Tibetan handwritten Buddhist scriptures. Each institute has established Chinese language courses and hired Chinese teachers, and enrollment is very enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Exchange of Lectures is in Progress. As for Japan, it has been actively promoting its culture in Italy in recent years, and has gradually achieved some success. Some libraries have accepted books donated by Japan, and the Royal University of Rome has exchanged professors and lectures with Tokyo Imperial University. In the past, China did not pay much attention to this area due to the small number of overseas Chinese in Italy, and its activities were rather clumsy. Last year, it quickly caught up and organized the Sino-Italian Cultural Association as an aid to China's foreign cultural diplomacy. The activities that have already been carried out include the public screening of domestic films, the large-scale donation of valuable books, the holding of current affairs lectures, and the public display of Chinese newspapers and magazines. Recently, it has been planning the exchange of professors and lectures between China and Italy, and Mr. Xu has been assigned to contact the Chinese education authorities.</p>
<p>Italian Youth Delegation to Visit China Next Summer. In addition, Italian youth are very concerned about China's recent construction and progress. This summer, they initiated the formation of the Italian Farnese Youth China Study Delegation, and more than 20 people have already joined, including university professors. They plan to travel and study in China during the summer vacation next year. The head of the delegation is Mr. Folioqi, the secretary of the Royal University of Rome, who has met with Mr. Xu several times. In the future, they will first formally contact the Chinese authorities.</p>
<h3>Wu Gongxian Goes to Study in England</h3>
<p>Wu Gongxian, from Rugao, Jiangsu, graduated from the Department of Biology at National Central University with a Bachelor of Science degree. He served as a teaching assistant in the Department of Biology at National Central University and a lecturer in the Department of Biology at China University in Peiping. He has made significant contributions to the study of cerebral cortex cells in white mice. He has now received a grant from the China Education and Culture Foundation Board of Trustees to study zoology at the University of London in England.</p>
<h3>Expansion of Xinhua Art College</h3>
<p>The Xinhua Art College on Xie Xu Road in this city is committed to quality education with equal emphasis on instruction and character-building. It has recently been focusing on promoting practical arts. This semester, it has expanded its campus, added workshops for the craft department, and craft product display rooms. It is striving to equip the labor department with machines and tools. Each semester, ten tuition-free places are offered in the craft and design department. The scholarship recipients for the second semester of the 24th year have also been announced, including Xie Shucheng, Lai Jiaxiu, Zhou Yuanqing, Yu Guiyi, Shen Pingyi, and more than ten others. The school is scheduled to hold entrance examinations for new students from today to the 31st.</p>
<h3>New Universal Vocational School Pays Attention to Extracurricular Activities</h3>
<p>The New Universal Vocational School and New Universal Junior High School on Chongqing Road in this city pay close attention to student training. In addition to the dean of students, each grade has a homeroom teacher.

<h3>Senior Singles First Week: Lin Baohua Defeats He Jialiu; Lin's Performance Shows Improvement; Defu Withdraws from Singles Competition</h3>
<p>Lin Baohua, who just returned to the country the day before, played against He Jialiu yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM in the first week of the Shanghai Western Lawn Tennis Club Senior Singles Championship. Lin has been abroad for several months, and his skills must have improved. Therefore, many people who admired his name came to watch yesterday, even more than for the Rotary Cup. Lin defeated He Jialiu in straight sets without much effort, and his skills have indeed improved considerably. In the second week, Lin will meet the Japanese player Sudo, and the date has not yet been determined. If he defeats Sudo, he will meet Carson in the quarter-finals. On the other hand, Defu has withdrawn from the singles competition, and Kelasha is bound to get the final right. Therefore, the quarter-final between Lin and Carson will be like the final, and the final will be lackluster. Lin's winning score against He is as follows:</p>
<p>Lin's performance did not increase in speed, but his strength was greater than before. The most obvious improvement was in the backhand, which was not only for returning the ball, but also for killing. His drop shots were more accurate and skillful than before, landing lightly and not bouncing up. This was found repeatedly in the first and second sets, making He Jialiu very embarrassed. He was able to cope better in the third set. According to Lin, many people in Europe use this method. Madame Lenglan of France can place a towel in the opponent's court and make the ball land on the towel, which is very skillful. Lin served first, winning three games in a row. He only won the fourth game. Lin won two more games, winning the first set with a score of 6 to 1. After the second set was 4 to 1, He rallied slightly, winning two consecutive games. Unfortunately, Lin won two more games, making it 6 to 3. He was at the end of his rope in the third set, and the score was 6 to 1.</p>

<h3>Junior Singles Competition: Tang Baojia Enters the Third Week; Defeats Frenchman Joe Deng Yesterday</h3>
<p>In the second week of the Junior Singles competition, Tang Baojia competed against Frenchman Joe Deng the day before. Tang lost the first set 1 to 6 due to underestimating the opponent.
