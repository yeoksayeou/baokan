<h3 id="c49">綏東戰爭爆發 <a href="#c49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>據近數日來的消息。敵人指揮偽匪軍進攻綏東的戰爭。業已爆發。這與過去取錦州攻長城併熱河割灤東進而至察北六縣。其方式完全如出一轍。一面以外交談判製造烟冪。一面伸展鐵掌攫取實益。等到烟冪的作用已充分發揮。則接踵而來的。必然是軍事上的新進取。現在綏東戰爭的爆發。又給我們增加一個實例了。</p>
<p>敵人進攻綏束的步驟。從今春察北六縣被侵奪後。卽已開始準備。偽滿傀儡軍張海鵬與李守信部的沾動。德王的被收買。偽蒙軍的逐漸擴大。以及敵人間諜的深入內蒙西北。在一年以來。差不多沒有一刻停止過。祇因華北五省整個局勢的非常嚴重。加以這種消息的不能在報端暢達披露。所以關於這方面的緊急形勢。沒有受到國人充分的注意。但在最近一兩月中。敵人在綏邊的活動。積極加緊。有識人士。早已提出了堅守這個「國防第一綫」的呼聲。綏省傅主席與部下將士。也早已堅築陣地。準備禦敵。果然。外交烟冪剛才過去。軍事的侵略隨卽開始了。</p>
<p>這次敵軍的進攻。以偽滿軍及偽蒙軍為前驅。後方的大本營在張北。由束北運來的軍火。集中於此。侵略的進展分三路。卽傀儡德王的卓世海部。偽滿軍李守信部及偽蒙匪軍王英部。一路攻包頭。一路攻武平。一路攻平地泉。而其中心的目標則為歸綏。這許多偽匪軍。總數約三四萬人。戰鬥力並不强。但他們的進攻。却是以日軍的飛機作掩護。以日軍的坦克作後盾的。所以在口頭上我們儘管說這是偽匪軍進犯。事實上這卽已表示國與國的戰爭重復爆發了。</p>
<p>這戰爭的嚴重性。我們决不容忽視。綏遠確是「華北最後的壁壘。西北各省的門戶。」綏遠若再失陷。不但山西寗夏。立成唇亡齒寒之勢。連整個華北。也像一箭在胸。無可挽救了。事急矣。吾人若不在目前立下决心。竭全力以救綏遠。則今後國土的淪陷。將較已失去的土地更速了。</p>
<p>綏遠的將士是赤誠愛國。决心堅守疆土的。這已有許多事實。蹬實。但據日來消息。前方士氣强盛。而糧食尙虞不足。在這方面應立予接濟。使他們在糧械以至人力的接濟補充上。毫無後顧之憂。現在北平學生及綏省旅平同鄉。已實行斷食節媒。接濟綏東的為民族生存而戰的將士。但願全國上下聞風景從。這是救亡最後的時機。不能再等待須臾了。</p>

<p>已第六委員會　等討論各種政治問題、但於我國有關係者甚少、而我郭代表因行政院理事選舉及海牙法庭補選問題、需要聯絡及與各國代表接洽、故委員會有時由秘書劉鍇參加、於討論國際逃亡者之問題時、委員會根據小組委員會之提議通過、派遣東方逃亡調杳團、我方亦匕附議云、</p>
<p>三、國聯盟約改組</p>
<p>問題　自阿根廷政府提出盟約改組開題後、本年七月一日國聯大會時會作初步討論、並於四日通過一决議案、交行政院照會各國、於九月大會以前表示意見、現在書面答覆者、巳有二十餘國、其餘未作畫面之國家、巳均由其代表在本屆大會中直接陳述矣、其中有的不免涉於理想、爲眼前國際形勢所不許、例如紐西蘭之提議創立國際軍隊以保障盟約、或會員國各出軍隊一部份歸國聯指揮、記得從前法國曾有此種主張、論者每議爲過於理想化、同時卽使能以實現將來之指揮權利、是否純粹屬於國聯、頗成疑問、就國聯眼前情勢觀察之、倘使該種理想能以實現、結果恐不免造成大國家保障本身的工具、適等於爲虎謀皮、不但不足以保障盟約、反陷國聯於更危急的情勢、尤易造成把持操縱之面局、有的主張增强盟約第十六條之制裁辦法、凡地理上毘連之國家、各相締結軍事互助義務之公約、所謂區域互助公約是也、然而此種公約之締結、是否應由國聯制定强迫締結之辦法、抑各關係國家有保留或自由訂立之權、則未見有具體的提案、主張訂立此種公約者、各大國之意見大同小異、然而此種公約若不由國聯制定强迫締結之辦法、恐强國對於弱國是否願意締結、或有無締結之可能、不免又發生困難問題、有的對於行政院一致表决之辦法、主張修改、凡和平感受威　之時、盟約之制裁辦法、不必經行政院「一致表决」、即可施行、以免侵略者利用其一票的機會逍遙法外、故遇有盟約第十一條第一節之情勢發生時、行政院經過三仆之二之半數通過、卽可執行、此種意見、蘇俄法國英國亦大同而小異、此外亦有主張維持盟約現狀、不加任何更改、惟主張盟約上所規定之减軍辦法、應切實付諸施行、尤　意於强國應行减軍、以求平衡、北歐國家如瑞典挪威丹麥可爲此種意見之代表、更有主張確定盟約第十條與第十六條之關係、以貫澈國聯盟約巴黎公約及南美國家所締結之各種反對武力侵奪的公約代表、此項主張者、爲阿根廷、而英國之意見、除上述與蘇俄法國相同之點外、尤認爲盟約應與各種和平條約分立、並應修改盟約第十九條之情節云、至於　國政府之意見、業於大會開會時送達國聯、國內各報已有登載、故不重贅、國聯大會已决定由總委員會開會討論、該委員會之開會日期、已規定有本年十二月七日、吾人甚望各國代表屆時表現合作的誠意、以便主張接近而趨於合理化與實際化、不致於使改組不成、畫虎類犬、反而容易造成歐戰前之割據局面也、</p>
<p>四、大會總討論中</p>
<p>我代表之演詞　大會總討論時、各國代表照例依報名次序、登台發表意見、我顧代表對於遠東嚴重情形及歐洲危急情勢之遠因近果、與國聯盟約改組運動中我國政府之意見、世界减軍問題與經濟狀况、均有主要的分析與批評、記者因感時局之重要、覺得我代表在國聯大會所發揮之意見、當爲國人所注意者、爰將演稿之全部譯義如下、</p>
<p>第十七屆大會於較前幾年愈不振作的情况下、我深知諸位中大多數對於歐洲搖動的時局、都感覺着不安、而請位的思想、已爲該種實際情形中之重要問題的責任所擾亂、因此我想提出一些不同樣的問題、關於我國及遠東大體的情形、來設幾句話因爲我深信今日的世界、有特別連帶的關係、在一個區域上所發生的問題、免不了重演於其他部份、由亞洲與歐洲的關係上看來、尤爲明顯、一九〇四至五年遠東嚴重事件之反響、於歐洲及一九一四至一八年歐洲的火警、映照於亞洲、可爲一個時代的歷史中兩個有力的圖解、亞東的現勢究竟如何、我願簡略的提出兩個事實來、第一爲過去的一年中我國之政治經濟建設之驚人的進步、最近中央政府與西南兩省之關係巳和平解决、全國政治統一、業已完成、關於公共衛生、水利工作、合作事業、農業的技術及實業的改良、電氣交通、摩特鐵路空運等等均有最大的成功、關於此種進步的情形、行政院委員會特派員之報告書中、已有詳細的描寫、秘書長的報告裏業已引證、我國與國聯之技術合作、將繼續得到滿意的結果、尤其是最近與國聯規定的辦法、能使我國專家得到西方最新的技術發展上之智識與經騐、在合作上將有更進一步的成功、在此種關係下使我們深深的感念哈斯先生之工作、由我國幣制與國外匯兌上言之也、已達到了一個顯著的結果、自外國銀價變動、使我國政府遭受了兩年的痛苦、但一九三五年十一月三日所頒佈的制度、業已通行於全國、由此種新經濟政策產生的結果、幣制鞏固、匯價穩定、對於出口實爲最有效的鼓勵、不平衡的貿易、因之尤爲銳减、英國經濟專家李滋羅斯爵士曾說過、其所採取的步驥、已在所得的成績中完全證明矣、總而言之、我國之內部建設工作、雖在特別困難情形之下、仍有驚人進步的表現、據美國遠東經濟調查團之觀察、謂「中國表現了極重要的變遷、其革新氣象與十年前甚至與五年前比較、足打破幾世紀的紀錄、此外關於遠東其他的問題、我願說幾句、在該處的情形、不但尚未解决而日對於戰爭的準備、益爲加緊、邊境上因軍隊的不斷活動、已發生了不少事變、目武裝的俊略、日益擴大、形成了一個極不安的現象、將不免有一個實際爆發的危險　足以嚴重的反響於歐洲、</p>
<p>談到歐洲眼前的情形、使吾人並不感覺可以减少憂慮、尤其是軍備的擴充、，羽翼業已豐滿、我想無論大國小國莫不特別感覺到、若不繼續維持和平、恐不及準備而一旦消滅於强權、同時各國亦在積極努力於强化國防、並締結無數的區域軍事同盟、好像似眼前沒有一個國家感覺有保障的、和平去其堅固性尚爲遼遠、實無異於過去的階段、談到經濟問題、　秘書長報告書中所述、似乎不少國家已有復興的證據、但是復興之降臨、我們能否確定、成爲一個疑問、從用一種詭詐的經濟方法、竭力追求、滿足具國家自私慾望的政策上看來、經濟復興道路之可疑、甚爲明顯、經濟的國家主義在世界各國中、尚未放棄其幻術、各種商業之障碍、仍在繼續的桎梏貿易阻碍其發展、要進而言之、各種條約之信用、數年以來、已根本動搖、各種國際義務之尊嚴、業已損壞、盟的上有糾微的和平制度與安全保障的意義、俱未照常實行、最近雖曾施行、又未產生所期望的效果、實因施行緩慢、且不充合法律與正義的基本宗旨、屈服於利便思想的時期太多了、集體和平的利益、最後亦因之損失、幾年來的歷史已指示着我們爲一時的逼迫而採取妥恊宗旨、其結果嘗使國際秩序益增紊亂、蓋情形愈嚴重、愈不安、則法律的處理愈不容易　行、四年前悲悼整個的盟的意義、失敗於遠東事件者、當時或亦機覺類似的情形、難免發生於西方今日、該種機覺已切實的實現了、或問在如此的情形之下、我們應該怎樣之緩和、這一個重大的問題、恐怕我不見得能給諸位一個十分完善的答復、我要說幾句話不過因爲我國感到西方目前的不穩定狀態、已直接影響到遠東了、因此十二分眞誠的希望此種不穩定狀態及早解除、中國代表團與其他代表團取同一的意見、頗以爲解除目前危機的主要事項、在乎信仰國聯以及維護盟的、因爲此項機關爲世界上維持和平的唯一組織、同時也可以說是應付國際爭執以及解决衝突的工具、以前國聯對於幾件重大事件的失敗、我已屢次說過、並不是盟的條文規定不妥當的錯誤、乃是運用的政策及方法上的錯誤、本年七月四日大會决議案的主旨也是如此、</p>
<p>我國政府在答復行政院的牒文裏已提出數項建議、其建議已詳於秘書長的覺書裏、並已分發與諸位、似乎無詳述其內容的必要、簡單的說、此項建議完全以增進國聯消戰爭與侵略的工作爲宗旨、使戰爭與侵略消戢於未發生之前、遏止於已發生之後、因此盟的第十六條所規定的各項方法、仍應予國聯以處理與執行之權、使適合盟的第十及第十一條之規定、如欲迅速制止侵略的發半、國聯應在事的制定侵略的定義、並應預定迅速及有效的計劃、以便施行盟的第十六條約各項方法、換句話說、行動的迅速、是收效的主要條件、而未雨綢繆、更是應付危機的主要條件、欲達到此目的、我國政府更建議大會應於最短期間表决侵略者之定義、並於秘書廳中附設一常任專家委員會、以制定關於盟的第十六條各項方法施行的細則、以便於大會决議施行第十六條時促助其實現、至於第十六條第二項所規定各會員國派遣軍隊一節、我國政府亦認爲十分重要、因爲此乃該條所規定的、其他各柯制止侵略方法中的最要附件、若能同時實施、始能使之成爲制止侵略與戰爭的完美制度、否則所謂制裁决不能發生迅速的效果、我國政府對於此項規定、因之認爲頗有研究之價値、應使國聯的主管機關、從事研究、並應預先規定各項實施方法使國聯於世界和平感受威脅的時候、有所憑藉、同時副以區域互助公約俾符合盟的之精神、我國政府的另一建議在於解除第十一條所規定的「一致表决」之條欵、以便於最短時期中取得决議、以免爭議事項因延誤而趨入於軍事侵略的行爲、遂發生戰爭、上述各點、不過犖犖大者、並非建議的全部、我國代表團仍主張於將來作具體的討論時再行補充建議的全部、我所以談到此數點、不過欲表示我國政府擁護國聯之至誠而已、並願對於這唯一維護和平的機關、使其增强力量、一層表示精誠合作、以促進共存之宗旨、同時我國政府頗以爲亞洲會員國應在行政院中佔有理事一席、俾使我國能於行政院中盡量供獻合作、在這一點上我很感謝行政院對於我們的主張所表示的熱忱態度、在去年九月所組織的行政院改組委員會、對於行政院之組織、已加以考慮、對於此事業已全體通過、而本屆大會第一委員會亦已全體通過矣、</p>

<p>菲律濱方面　該團抵菲律濱之首都馬尼剌、得中華總商會之協助、在李淸泉主席領導下、舉行國貨展覽會、菲總統奎松、及副總統奧斯米寗、深爲贊助、同時該團與中菲國民協會之折衝、努力增進中菲間之情感、故展覽會盛况、不亞於嘉年華會、菲律濱之市塲、幾完全爲日貨所獨佔、雖美國貨能免稅進口、而仍不能競爭、國貨之運往菲島、已逐年减少、現該團已與該地各大國人進口商、作有力之協定、在雙方互助原則下、力謀國貨在菲島開拓市塲、該團返國後、當能實現、</p>

<p>暹羅方面　暹羅有二百五十萬華僑、到處是中國商店、且目前暹羅政府中、不少高級官員、均屬中國血統、該團抵暹後、其歡迎盛况、不亞於前暹羅考察團、暹羅爲農業國家、故工業品均賴輸入、以前國人極少了解暹羅市塲、該團考察結果、認爲大有希望、有極多貨品、可以運往銷售而國貨尚未去過、因此每日參觀國展會者、極爲擁擠、在暹羅期內、高團長召集各領袖、討論結果、第一步組織國貨公司、當時卽籌得資本七萬元、定於最短期內、促其實現、故前途極樂觀、該團一行業已在棉蘭工作完畢、於十一月三日在棉蘭起程返國、經新加坡西貢等地、略有停留、乘原船（法郵霞飛將軍號）返國、本市工商界、以該團萬里長征、爲國貨增光、已籌備熱烈歡迎、屆時當有一番盛况也、</p>

<p>昨日下午六時許、法租界福煦路第二百二十三號弄內發生盜刦、捕房聞報、飭派大批中西探捕、馳往掩捕、眾盜竟頑强抵抗、雙方開槍互轟、結果三盜中彈被擒、另有一盜、因身中三槍、已逃至小沙渡路勞工醫院求治、經該院通知捕房、遂亦就逮、而捕房率隊前往之値班主任卽副督察邦克拉基Pancrazi及第四八六號越捕兩人因奮勇圍捕、亦各受槍傷、詳情錄後、</p>
<p>兩里鐵柵</p>
<p>法租界福煦路第二二三弄卽係同德里、該里位於白爾部路迤西、巨箱達路東端、弄口異常狹窄、入弄約百武、始見有新建石庫門住房十餘幢、該里東通白爾部路太和里、兩里閒立有鐵柵一所、終年鎖閉、不輕開啟、西通蒲石路之漁陽里、彼此通行無阻、</p>
<p>莊家住所</p>
<p>該里面南東首第一家第十六號門牌、爲一單幢三層樓住宅、二房東爲潮州人莊志揚、（年二十九歲）莊現任公共租界漢口路杜茂洋行出口部買辦、家中人口甚多、莊之闔家、除住於二樓及樓下客堂外、三樓則分租與甬人孫義榮、孫現服務於泰興洋行咖啡出口部、</p>
<p>五盜臨門</p>
<p>昨日下午六時一刻莊宅有一女傭正在廚房內整理雜物之際、突由後門闖入一着藍布短裝、一穿灰色長袍、一御條子布短衫、口操本地音之盜匪三人、以詢問王姓爲由、直入客堂、尚有兩盜則在門口把風、當時莊之胞弟莊名甫適在客堂閒坐、身着藍布短裝之一盜卽袖出手槍、禁止聲張、並逼入後客堂之小房間內、</p>
<p>監視家屬</p>
<p>同時在門口把風之兩盜中、又走入一人、卽監視莊弟之行動、前入三盜、卽一齊登樓、將樓上下所有闔宅大小人等、共計二十餘人、一併驅至樓下、與莊弟同禁於一處、然後復行上樓、開始搜刦、詎當三盜入門步至客堂出示手槍之際、適有莊志揚之妻弟名胡少華、年僅十二、性頗機警、</p>
<p>幼童被捕</p>
<p>當時胡見一盜對莊名甫出示手槍、知非善類、卽一人先竄上樓、三盜因倉皇間亦未加注意、乃胡步上三樓、卽越過晒台而至隔壁十七號屋內、再由十七號大門而出、穿過漁陽里、奔至蒲石路白爾部路口、報告該處崗捕、該捕聞報、立卽報告嵩山路捕房、捕頭立派預備隊長梅益、率隊先行馳往、然後電話通知盧家灣總巡捕房請求協助</p>
<p>捕探齊來</p>
<p>盧家灣　巡捕房聞報、立由値班主任副督察邦克拉基、親自率同俄探員斯太昔古、及總預備暨中西探捕出動馳往、先將該里外面包圍、然後撞擊後門、當時樓下監視諸人之一盜、知事不妙、卽向樓上猛呼一聲、三盜直奔下樓、一齊擬啟大門圖逃、</p>
<p>互擊重創</p>
<p>不料大門外衆探捕早四面埋伏、兩盜甫出大鬥、已被隱伏在隔壁十七號門口之探捕瞥見、速發數槍、兩盜均應聲倒地、而殿後兩盜、遂自門內鳴槍衝出、彈如飛蝗、衆探捕遂亦奮勇還擊、雙方互轟至數十槍、尤以副督察邦克拉基奮不顧身、首先衝擊、混戰歷一刻鐘之久、結果三盜受傷而踏、邦氏及第四八六號越捕兩人左腿部、亦各受彈創、</p>
<p>傷者送醫</p>
<p>三盜受傷就擒後、尚有兩盜則被兔脫、衆探捕在各弄內窮搜一過、並無影踪、遂將三盜帶入捕房、經捕頭嚴詰、據供一名顧榮生、年二十七歲、一名王榮生、年二十歲、一名楊四林、年四十三歲、均直認糾衆行刦不諱，而三盜均傷在腹部、乃連同副督察邦克拉基及第四八六號越捕、先送金神父路廣慈醫院、</p>
<p>少年求治</p>
<p>詎法捕房正在辦理善後之際、忽接到公共租界捕房電話略謂、頃問小沙渡路勞工醫院、忽來一身中三槍之少年求治、醫院因係槍傷、特此通知捕房、因詢問法租界方面是否發生開槍事件、法捕房聞訊、立飭探趕往、經盤詰一過、始知即係拒捕五盜之一、遂移解法捕房、據供名王愛卿、年四十二歲、江陰人、而該盜所穿長袍、卽係莊家贓物、捕頭見該盜傷勢甚重、乃先送廣慈醫院、</p>
<p>與民合作</p>
<p>事後、據失主述明當時被刦情形、除莊家被刦一百餘元、及金鑽戒各一只、三樓房客孫義榮亦刦去皮包一只、內儲三十四元外、金耳圈一付、但一部份之贓物、已自各盜身畔搜獲、故事實上損失甚微、事後、據捕房方面表示、嗣後頤界內居民一遇盜警、務希愼重應付、見機報捕、捕房無不盡力緝捕、以與居民合作、此次如十二歲幼童胡少華之機警越屋報告、　盜以重創、實不可多得也、</p>

<p>乙，屬於八月份者</p>
<p>八月份中特種事業項下金融業之異動，其重要者有五：</p>
<p>一，中國實業銀行裁撤二辦事處—該行於民國四年由財政部奉令籌辦，於民國八年四月成立，資本定額爲國幣二千萬元，實收額爲三百五十萬零七千四十元，係股份有限公司組織，經政府特許發行紙幣，開業以來，營業殊佳，去年幣制改革以後，該行所發紙幣奉令由交通銀行逐漸收併，所辦有獎儲蓄亦移歸中央信託局辦理，故原有業務已略减少。本年六月該行總理胡孟嘉氏逝世後，卽由該行董事長龔仙洲君兼代。龔氏就任以來，銳意整頓，因鑒於愚園路及虹口兩辦事處已無設置之必要，故卽分別裁併於南京路及北京路兩辦事處繼續辦理云。</p>
<p>二，上海綢業商業儲蓄銀行裁併分支行—該行最近改組之經過已詳見上月份報告中，最近該行爲調整營業方針及節省各項開支計，將虹口。西區兩分行及八仙橋支行一併裁併與總行辦理，亦爲該行新總輝陸子冬君就任後整頓計劃之一。</p>

<p>吾國網球界之「愛力生」馬安權、昨以直落三擊敗李丕祖、獲取本年上海法商總會硬地網球單打冠軍、（按馬君之精神與姿態、頗似美國網球名將愛力生、故特以名之）按馬君爲以前草地會初級單打冠軍、數年來雙未見有若何顯著之進步、但擊法已老練、經騐亦相當豐富、此次硬地賽中、先後擊敗柯拉沙及卡那凡洛等西人名將、固早知其奪標希望、呼聲最高也、李丕祖爲南京冠軍、特來滬參加、複賽中曾淘汰擊敗史規亞之沈美鎮、球藝亦甚可取、但以臨陣慌張、正手抽球不穩、遂爲馬安權所挫敗、另一塲原爲女子雨打决賽、臨時改爲單打决賽、對壘者克倫諾甫夫人及海利斯夫人、兩人球藝老練、戰情緊張、表演反較男子單打激烈興奮、結果克夫人以二比一獲得錦標、兩組成績如下、</p>
<p>馬李之戰　馬安權以各種平均發展之擊法、操縱全局、李丕祖之反手抽球亦相當穩着、但正手擊法反軟弱而無把握、且開始頗有怯塲之態、至被馬一刹時連得五局之多、而以六比一歸馬勝第一盤、第而盤開始、李丕祖頗能出之鎭靜、沉着應戰、故形勢忽然轉機、大有後來居上之勢、以三比一、四比二、五比四、着着佔先、但當此緊要關頭、馬安權又晚頴而出　造成六比六之平等局面、接戰　遂趨緊張、李丕祖屢圖大舉、卒不成功、又被馬以八比六連勝、</p>
<p>再戰中、李丕祖受上盤之功虧一簣、銳氣似受相當挫折、鬱鬱不得志、反見馬安權靑雲直上、精神振作、五比零又高懸於紀錄板上、第六局馬發球又以四〇十五佔優、祇須再加一記、卽罄大功、李丕祖最後掙扎、突然奮發有爲、攻破馬君之發球局、繼又取得下局、成五與二之比、但終未能平反局面、被馬以六比二造成直落三之結果、而取得冠軍、二人戰情弛緩、精彩甚少、</p>
<p>女子决賽　女千單打决賽、在馬李之戰之先、克倫諾甫夫人身驅肥碩、出球殺辣、海利斯夫人則爲牛皮糖一條、在底奔蹤還球、穩健非凡、二人表演精彩、遠勝馬李之戰、而情勢之緊張、競爭之劇烈、更足使觀衆神情興奮、賣人欣賞也、</p>
<p>今日秩序　今日决賽秩序、爲（一）女子雙打、摩爾夫人拉姆夫人、對海利斯夫人瑪賽小姐一時半起在第三球塲、（二）男子雙打、馬安權周冠軍對李國墦胡旭光、二時半起亦在第三塲、（三）混合雙打、摩爾夫人與德孚對克倫諾甫夫婦、二時半起在第二塲、</p>

<h3 id="c190">品行 <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 寓意</p>
<p>諸位小朋友，你們的敎師，平日總向你們說過一個人非但要學問好並且還要品行好吧。現在不談學問，且說品行。甚麼是品行，品行可以說是人的一切行為。品行好，可以說是一切行為好，怎樣的行為纔算好，那是很容易下一個定義，我們可以說，好品行應該是誠實。謙遜，有禮和虛心。</p>
<p>何謂誠實？誠實是對己對人都不加欺騙；何謂謙遜？謙遜是對人恭敬客氣；何謂有禮？有禮是行為不越規矩；何謂虛心虛心？是不驕傲不自大。</p>
<p>我有一位親戚，他自從小學畢業之後，便入某公司學業，轉眼三年期滿，可以掌管一些銀錢上的事情了，可是因其受了朋友們的誘惑，私自挪用了行款，事發被歇。他便是為了不誠實而不能上進。換句話說，便是品行不好而不能上進。</p>
<p>諸位小朋友，學問固然要好，品行也要好啊。古人每勸人「教品勵學」，實在是一些也不錯的。</p>
<h3 id="c191">東北的一位小弟弟 <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— 王士鵬</p>
<p>這次我帶了三十幾位小朋友，到南京，加全國童子軍大檢閱。初到南京的－天，我們赴總部報到後，便開始在指定的地點紮營；費了大半天的時間，營地才佈置好。我們很快慰，因為明天是任人參觀的－天。</p>
<p>翌日，來營地參觀的人根多。約莫在下午二時許，有七個身穿童子軍制服的小弟弟，來我們營地參觀，經他們自己的介紹，我們便知道那紮着黑色領巾的一位小弟弟，是吉林人，其他六位，是河北人，他們是專為大檢閱而來南京的。我們這裏三十幾位小朋友，要我央請他告訴我們些關外的消息</p>
<p>他說：「我家住在吉林敦化，自「滿洲國」國旗，掛入我們校中的旗桿頂上後，情形便大變了。我們的課本也改變了，每個學校都有幾位外國先生。地理課本的第一課是「滿洲國」的疆界；國語第一課是國旗歌（是指滿洲偽國的國旗）。每天上午，那幾位先生便來教我們外國語。平時先生對我們說：關內土匪很多，人民個個吃鴉片烟。我們自到關內來以後，才知道這些話，全是欺騙我們的謊話。</p>
<p>我們在那裏讀書，真痛苦極了。記得有一次，我們班上一位外國籍的同學，不知為了什麽事情，和級長起了衝突，他便報告他們的老師，老師將級長打得皮破血流。同學們見了，那個不切齒痛恨？不過都是敢怒而不敢言呀。我的父親一向在關外經商，去年七月，他便把我送到北平姑母家裏來，我現在在河北縣立小學讀書，這次到南京來，看到全國各地的弟兄姊妹們，心中非常之興奮；可是每一憶起家鄉的那隻學校，多時沒有見面的許多同學，現在不知又受了多少委屈呢」？</p>
<p>他這樣滔滔不絕的告訴我們，說得我們大家珠淚盈眶；因為時間不早了，他便告辭我們回營去。</p>
<p>小朋友，這位小弟弟告訴我門的話，你們都看過了吧？大家想一想：我們用什麽方法來拯救在這水深火熱中的兄弟姊妹們呢？</p>

<p>長驅直入，痛飲黃龍，一顯我大中華民族的威風。</p>
<p>那和平之神永遠現着微微的笑容，青天白日的国旗飄遍了天空。</p>

<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>我很希望我們中國，會有這麽樣的一日：</p>
<p>在某一天的報上，忽然發現了一個用大字刋登着的消息，說的行一隊兒童，都是未滿十六歲的，在三個月以前，購置了一艘馬托船。這個馬杯船，是準備作探險之用的。所以定各為「兒童探險號」。一切設備，都是具有對於巨浪冰塊等抵抗力的。他們一切都準備就緒之後便例纜　發，雖然他們並不是世界的著名科學家，由是他們却都是具有着充分的科學智識的，所以驾駛及無綫電的收發等等，完全是由他們自己担任着，自從出發後，很少有消息的傳播，所以會屢次的謠傳着這些兒童，巳犧牲在他們的事業之中了。但昨晚本報接該「兒童探險號」所發無綫電報告，稱「探險隊，業已在太平洋中，發現新大陸，面積甚大，一時難於估計。居民均為土人，為數極少，生活簡單。該島滿地均是金屬礦，與石油礦，現已由不隊高升國旗，獲得主權，希政府迅派海軍及飛機測量隊，前往工作。」</p>
<p>在某一天的報上，忽然又發現了一個用大字刮登着的消息，說的在其省某村落中，有一個十五歲兒童，呌做×××的，本是十分貧苦的，但他　很愛讀書，更其是一切近代科學的實騐。在他八歲時，便已有着一個自天然物質中，尋求出人類食物來的理想。若干年來，把為人傭工之所得，完全消耗在他的簡單而精緻的實騐室裏。他的父母，屢次的阻撓他的科學的研究，他的鄰居親友們，都訕笑他的痴愚，但是他却依然孜孜不倦的研究着。不過無數次的失敗，有時也會迫得他在萬藾俱寂之夜，自己傷心得痛哭起來，但是他並不灰心，還是再接再厲的研究着。最近他的研究，是成功了，他在平常的空氣之中，發現了一種科學界倘未發現的物質，可用人工製造成一種粉末狀的固體。這稱粉來狀固體一公厘，便可替代着麵包一磅，牛肉半磅，牛乳一磅中所含的滋養料，是很好的食糧代用品。連日本國及外國的記者與科学家，均紛紛前往訪問，都認為這個發明，是給與今代的政治經濟等等的一大革命，造福人們於無窮。而本年的諾貝爾科學獎金，無疑地，是將給與這位小科學家云。</p>
<p>我希望我們中國的兒童，會有這麼樣的　日。而同時，我相信，我國那麼坤秀的兒童，必有使我的希望，見諸事實之一日。</p>
<h3 id="c194">聲音 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— 真</p>
<p>在星期日的那天早上，敏兒和他的哥哥聽兒在家園裏作一些健身的體操，那天天氣很晴和，枝上的小烏哎吱喳喳的在唱着，他覺得這聲音怪好聽；怎麽能聽得呢？這個問題，他從來沒有懷疑過，這是一定的道現，有什麽懷疑呢？可是他如今愈想愈有問題，有了問題非解决不可，那便只好問他的哥哥：</p>
<p>「哥哥，從聽這小鳥的歌聲眞好聽，我們怎樣能聽得到呢？」</p>
<p>「你要知道怎能聽得小烏的歌聲，那非先要知道這小烏怎麼會發聲的？我說小烏的發聲是它的喉間的聲帶在振動，可見聲音的發生是由一物體在振動。取怎麼能知道？這可以試給你看。」他便去拿了－隻琵琶，用手指去彈其中的一根，那絃便很快的振動而鏗鏗的發聲了。然而他更把手指一觸，那經的振動便立刻停止聲音也隨而消失。他便開口說道：「從此可以知道了。至於我們怎樣能聽見小烏的呌聲？當小烏在呌的時候，附近的空氣也隨之振動，一會疏，一會密，這種一疏一密能逐漸向上下，左右，前後各方面依次傳播開去，和水裏的波紋一般，這是聲音的波紋，所以　它聲波，這聲波傳到了我們的耳朵裏，振動了我們的鼓膜，才覺得有聲音」</p>
<p>「哥哥，為什麼有的聲音響？有的聲音輕？有的聲音洪？這有什麽分別？」</p>
<p>聲音的響輕，大小的區別很難明瞭，不是把聲音的强弱和高低夾分別一下，倒容易明白：如果那絃被彈得越重，那麼振動的距離越大，聲音便越强；如果那絃被彈的越輕，振動距離也越小，那聲音也越弱，由此可知聲音的强弱，和發聲體的振動距離的大小成正比例。如那絃越短越細，越緊張，振動便也越快，那麽聲音越高；如那絃越長，越粗，越鬆，振動便也越慢，那麽聲音越低，可見聲音的高低，由於發聲體振動的快慢，也就是由於振動次數的多少。聲音的響輕就是我所說的强弱，聲音的尖洪就是高低。」</p>
<p>「哥哥，那麼有的聲音很好聽，像音樂的聲音，有的聲音不好聽，像哭聲，這是什麼道理？」</p>
<p>「那紋振動的時候，它附近的空氣也連續的一疏一密，便成了疏密相間的聲音，如那絃的振動很有規律所發生的聲音當然也很有規律，我們便覺很它是好聽了，所以呌它為樂音。哭的聲音所起的振動是沒有規律的，我們便覺得它是不好聽了，所以呌它為噪音。</p>
<h3 id="c195">肺病統計 <a href="#c195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— 濤</p>
<p>中國患肺病的死亡率，比起任何一國為大，因為這種病菌，最容易傳染，不必要與病人接觸，就是在空氣中，也不知不覺地傳染到了。所以病者愈多，而傳染他人的機會，也就非常的多。當患病初期，不易感覺，但一經發現，所謂已到二，三期的程度，始臨時抱佛脚，延醫診治，可是已雞收效了；同時，國民經濟的貧迫，也是罹致肺病的一大原因，那般掙扎在死亡綫上的人們，卽使知道不幸的患了肺病，可是，那有經濟力量去醫治？因此，肺核菌之在中國，才一天天蔓延擴大，而與國人然結了不解之緣似的。</p>
<p>近見報載，曾有一個駭人聽聞的肺病統計！</p>
<p>本市某醫院，在施行防癆×光檢騐時，就我們青年學生中，前往該院檢騐者，在九月份內，共計四百廿八人，其中曾患肺病者八十六人，已獲治愈者八人，正在患病初期者十七人，總計患病者約佔百分之二四强；卽平均每四人中，有一人患病。想來每個小朋友看到這個可怕的統計數字，都要寒心的吧！</p>
<p>預防肺病的方法很多，不過，簡而易行的，只須注意下到數項：（一）講求個人的公共的衛生，促進小朋友們衛生常識的履行，（二）提倡體育，鍜鍊金鋼不壞的身體。這樣簡直使肺菌望而却步，根本不能侵入。必需如此，庶幾自己該活到某種壽歲的生命，才不會中途夭折，不入「枉死」之路！</p>

<h3 id="c197">指南針 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 王志定</p>
<p>小朋友們：指南針這個名字你們大概都聽到過吧？它的用途你們大概也都知道了。這裏我來談談它的構造和其原理好不好？</p>
<p>在未談它的構造和其原理時，我們不妨先來曉得曉得它的發明者。說起來話良長，距現在四千年以前，那時是黃帝（黃帝是名字，姓公孫）的時候，有一個橫暴的諸候（蚩尤）造反起來，黃帝便派兵去打他，但是不幸得很，當黃帝出兵的時候，恰巧下了幾天的大霧，黃帝的士兵們都迷了路，因此就打了敗仗。</p>
<p>不久，黃帝發明了指南車，能够在大霧中找尋方向，他把這指南車給士兵們去應用，結果他便勝利了。</p>
<p>自從黃帝發明了指南車，後來便有人把它改良成為指南針，它的構造是很節單的，用一個圓盤，盤的面上四角寫了東南西北四個字，中心處有一根小往，柱的頂上放了一枚磁針，盤的上面放了一塊玻璃，右面生了－個拿手的柄，這樣就完了。</p>
<p>現在我們把其餘無關緊要的東西都丟開，祇來講這一枚磁針，因為指南針之所以能够指南，全靠着這一枚磁針的呀。</p>
<p>磁針是什麽東西呢？就是含有磁性的一枚針，磁性是什麽東西呢？這是一種自然界的現象，在磁鐵鑛裏明特有的，它能够吸取鐵的另件（　鐵釘，鐵絲等），小朋友們大該都看到過吸鐵石吧，假使我們拿了一把小刀在它的上面摩擦幾下，那未這把小刀也能够吸鐵了是不是？指南針裏的磁針也是用還個方法做成的，它的兩端呌做兩極，一頭是南極，一頭是北極。</p>
<p>那末它怎麽會永遠地指着南面呢？小朋友們不是要　了嗎？這是很而單的，原來地球也是一槐磁石，它也有南北兩極，指南針的南極度被地球的北極吸住，指南針的北極被地球的南極吸住。這就是「異性相吸，同性相排。」的原理，所以指南針是永遠地指着南面了。</p>
<p>指南針裏的東南西北四個字呌做四方，假使要在推測方向時便利些，便可以把它變為八方或十六方。（同八方一樣的如上去）</p>
<h3 id="c198">蟋蟀在呌着 <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>

<p>月姐兒　着國團的臉龐，呈着凉快的笑意，偷偷地向各家窗前偷窺伺着這時每兒給伊一引誘，竟睜大了眼，一時不肯到夢鄕裏去。他瞧着窗外的窗影，映在琉璃窗上，竟是一幅極好的寫生。又聽到那紡織娘躲在瓜架的叢葉中。嘔！咂！的呌個不住，他恨不得跳，床來，在月亭底下瞧一會兒</p>
<p>瞿！瞿！瞿！又是一陣引誘的聲兒，從階下發出，很清晰地傳到枕畔。敏兒知道這是蟋蟀的呌聲，便聯想到蟋蟀的種種。他想到隔壁的大雄，蓄着一頭雄健的蟋蟀，和別人鬥起來，總是百戰百勝。他又想到蟋蟀的牙齒，真和織鉗一般的利害：兩腿的勁兒，恰像慣跑路的人的車夫；那一陣得勝的鳴聲，又和戰號一般的嘹亮。他想得出神了，眼前便有一巨大的蟋蟀出現，竟有蚱蜢一般大小。他還在　小，那蟋蟀便隨着已意擱大起來，一會兒像知了那般大，青蛙那般大小，貓那設大小，狗那般大。敏兒喜極了。他想有了這一隻蟋蟀，不要說隔壁大雄的常勝　軍不經它半咬，便是集合天下所有的蟋蟀和它厮併，也不在它心上咧！敏兒也急急的跟着它。一到園子裏，大蟋蟀瞿瞿地呌了幾聲，眞像大將軍發號施令一般，草地裏頓時湧出成千成百的小蟋蛉來，分放兩隊，怒目撩牙的整備厮鬥。又是一　號令，兩方面動手了，牙齒兒對鉗着，腿　兒　，鬥得興起的，肚子仰天了，翻起身來仍是戰鬥。一回，二回，……數十回，……百回纔漸漸的分出勝敗來。敗的那一面，腹破腸流，海　挺的死在地上；便是勝的方面，也是鬚折了，齒缺了，腿跛了，作着呻吟般的　鳴。敏兒瞧了這情形，心中覺得不自在，嘴裏的嘰咕着：「都是自己人，為什麼打得　般悽慘呢？」陡的眼前景物一變，那　子成為戰塲，許多死傷的蟋蟀，變成一個個屈死的戰士的冤魂。他們齊口同聲的說：「我們不要受人挑撥着幹　儂事情，我們不要做着傀儡打自己人，我們應當聯全起來，去殺地挑動爭戰的人。」邊說邊指着敏兒說：「這便是我們的仇人，但是挑動我們爭戰的。一說畢，這許多冤魂有的提着斷去的頭，有的由着半折的脚，有的流着血汚的腸子，吼一聲，齊向敏兒奔來，　着敏兒要償命。敏兒大吃一驚。要向轉身逃跑，已來不及了。啊喲一聲，滿身冷汗，一瞧仍在床上，原來是一個惡夢。</p>
<p>這時敏兒瞧窗外的月色，有些朧朧了；那階下的蟋蟀，仍是瞿瞿地在呌着。</p>

<p>這是一個很有興趣的游戲：很簡單的，每個小朋友都能够自己照樣的去做一隻，玩起來一定是很有趣味的。現在我來說與你聽：</p>
<p>（用具）鵝毛管一枝。細竹棒一根（約三四寸長）。番薯或擬類一塊。</p>
<p>（方法）先把鵝毛管的下段（空的一段）剪下。再把竹棒削得比鵝毛管稍小些。又把番薯（其他瓜類也可）削得二分那樣厚。這些做成後，就可開始玩了！把鵝毛管挿進番薯裏，再把別一頭挿到底裏後，把它拿起，用竹棒向鵝毛管的大的一頭推進去，那末鵝毛管裏的番薯便會『撲』的一聲，向前面射出去，一直可以射到二三丈以外，同汽槍差不多。（見圖）</p>
<p>（原理）這個游戲，完會是利用空氣的壓力的道理，　因為當把竹棒推進鵝毛管的時候，鵝毛管裏的空氣壓迫得很重，所以就要把別一頭的番薯向外射出去了！</p>

<p>有一天，柏丝可菲趕了一整天的長路，離開一個呌做迦木吉的地方不遠，不幸遇了一次極猛烈的風潮，伊急急地向前趕去希望能夠到達最近的人家，可以躱一下子。不料却有一棵樹被風吹倒下來，恰好橫在伊的面前，伊就想還是躱在這些密密的樹枝樹葉裏面，比較的安全一些，至少是可以又受大風的吹打了。等到風潮减退時，天色已晚，伊再也不敢在暗中摸索着走去，於是就留在這裏，一動都不動，雨水從樹枝上滴下來，把伊的衣服全都濕透了。天明之後，伊才又走到大路上去，遇見了一個趕小車的農人，許伊坐上車去，八點鐘時到了一處村子裏，就把伊放了下來。伊一下車就跌在地上，全身的衣服，不但濕透，並且沾滿了泥汚，伊又冷又餓，又是乏力，眼瞧着四周屋子的整潔。更使伊暗暗吃驚，不敢走近。然而伊為飢寒所迫，終於放胆走到一扇開着的窗子前，見有一個婦人在剝着豆，伊就懇求着給伊休息一會，烘乾伊的衣服，但那婦人很輕蔑的瞧了伊一眼，喚伊立刻走將開去；伊再到別一家去懇求，也受到同樣的待遇，接着伊又走到了一家門口坐下來，不道屋中的主婦，立時趕伊開去，說伊們是不能容留偷兒和流民的。</p>
<p>柏絲可菲悄悄地想道：不論怎樣，我要是上禮拜堂去時，他們總不至於趕我出來吧。但是伊找到了禮拜堂，却見那門緊緊地鎖着，沒奈何就在階上坐下來休息一會，村中的小孩子們緊集攏來。包圍着伊，向伊嘲笑呌喊，罵伊是賊和私奔者；伊在那裏逗留了足足兩小時，整備着凍死餓死的了。但伊的心中還在默禱着上天，給伊勇氣挨過這因苦的關頭。</p>
<p>末後有一個比較慈善的婦人，從那些小孩子中間走將上來，很溫和的來和伊說話。柏絲可菲便訴說伊昨夜在森林中淋雨過宿的經過，當下由那村長過來查看伊的護照，見是和伊本人一切都是符合的。那慈善的婦人自願帶伊回去，但伊站起身來時，却覺得四肢都已凍僵，不能動彈，兩脚踵了起來，鞋子已失去了一隻；昨夜在上風雨中露宿時，委實是使伊苦痛極了。村中的人，這時也都發了善心，弄了一輛車子來，　着柏絲可菲，跟那好婦人一同同去。在那裏住了幾天，漸漸復原，見已可以趕路了。有一個村人就送了伊一雙靴子。從此以後，伊往往休息一天二天，瞧伊的體力，天氣，和人家的招待，以定去留。凡是人家具留伊小住的，伊往往給他們做些掃地，洗衣，或縫紉等一切小工作，作為報答。伊覺得開始還是不把伊代父，求赦的事情說出來，比較的來得聰明，因為逢人訴說，人家會當伊是　個騙子的；所以伊開始只向人家要一些東西吃，要是對方熊虔和善，伊便進一步訴說伊一路上的疲乏而懇求他們許伊休息一夜，要是人家具容留伊時，彼此談得投機，然後把伊的事情從頭訴說出來。</p>

<p>未死以前的魯迅先生，無事時總是每日在內山書店裏閒坐，這已成爲大家所共知的事了。因此，近十幾年來內山書店和牠的創設者內山完造君，也隨着「魯迅」這字樣使人們深深地印在腦子裏。爲了要想知道一點關於魯迅先生死後的事，以及存心想見見這位內山先生，我便在一個黃昏初臨的傍晚到了公園靶子塲。走進書店以後，問了一聲，才曉得內山先生正去吃飯，一位華籍店員很客氣地請我坐下等一等，同時又問我爲了什麽事要看他。我說明是仰慕拜訪之意後，那位先生便指着書架上一冊「一個日本人的中國觀」說，這便是內山先生的近作，我看見另有一種開明版的中文本，是允炳圻君翻譯的，便趁這機會取下這書來看。首先看到魯迅先生的序。在序之中，在如下介紹的語句：「著者（指內山君）是二十年以上生活於中國，到各處去旅行，接觸了各階級的人們的，所以來寫這樣的漫文，我以爲實在是適當的人物。事實勝於雄辯，這些漫文，不是的確放着一種異彩嗎？自己也常常去聽漫談，其實是負有捧塲的權利和義務的，但因爲已是很久的「老朋友」了，所以也想添幾句壞話在這里。其一，是有多說中國的優點的傾向，這是和我的意見相反的。……還有一點，……就是讀起那漫文來，往往頗有令人覺得「原來如此」的處所。（下略）著者的用心，還是在將中國的一部分眞相，紹介給日本讀者的。但是，在現在，總依然因了各種的讀者，那結果也不一樣罷。這是沒有法子的事。」其决便是翻看了著者的作爲序論的一篇「文章文化與生活文化」，那結語是：「日本的支那研究家，僅研究了支那之文獻，與夫堆砌文獻的文章而已。我却注視生活，而欲把握住生活文化也。」又翻到他漫談「便茶」一篇中說：「我也摹倣着支那人，每年在街頭施送便茶。（中略）不論在排日如何激烈的時節，却沒有一個不喝茶的人。實在是渴極了的話，祗要給他所想喝的東西時，則沒有國籍相異，人種差別的問題了。排斥也者，不用也者，豈非把不想要或是可怕的束西給了他們的緣故嗎？很渴很渴的時候，予以黏糊糊的泥巴，將如何呢？作如此問的人，已經不够人情了。」我正要繼續翻看時，已聽見一陣嘻嘻哈哈的笑聲從門外送進來，接着，那位店員便招呼了我一聲說：「內山先生來了。」他沒有替我介紹；不過我素來認識他，因爲我同在亞塵先生去過那里，見過他的面。我便走向他去。他一進店門，並沒有望別處，便一直走到那堆得如同屛風樣的書架後面，擺得有兩張寫字桌（也類如帳桌）以及平列了好幾把竹椅的地方（據內山君說：這裏是他和魯迅先生及朋友們常常雅集漫談之處）。雖然天氣只是已凉而未寒，但在那環繞着椅子的空隙當中，已經放着一個燒着火的火缸。內山先生光着頭，上身僅穿一件毛絨衫，下身一條西裝褲，笑嘻嘻地坐下來。我走過去向他通了姓名，他恍然如素識的望了望，我便接着說明來意。他又嘻嘻哈哈笑道：「好極了，好極了！」說過這話，他便和藹地注視着我，彷彿準備着回答一切問題。我稍微想了一想說：「您先生那本「中國觀」，我僅看了一鱗半爪已很佩服。假使看完，不知要給我多少增廣見聞的去處呢？不過，我想問問您對於中國新聞界方面有甚麼觀察沒有？」他聽話時很留意，但他却所答非所問地說：「我看了近二十年的申報了，所遇見的中國新聞記者，數目雖不記得，但十七八年以前的老記者，而今老得很，或者死了的多是朋友。」我接着說：「這倒眞是老話，這樣說起來，我倒要請問您內山書店最初開設在那一處？」他摸着沒有留長鬚的下巴笑道：「還是那個魏盛里。二十年前，那裏沒有甚麼人家。福民醫院是有了，廣學會也有了。如同一個村鎭似的，在四面荒野中間。現在永安里地方是老明强中學，還有一個耶穌堂。在那左右，有一個日本人靑年會也開始創設了，我那時才三十一二歲，如今我五十二歲了。我比魯迅先生小四歲，他五十六，很可惜。我想到當時很多的朋友：李大釗，李漢俊，陳獨秀……眼前，這些人都看不見了！」他如有所失地悵惘了一會。同時，他去尋了一張魯迅先生遺像給我，並題了幾個字。他說：「在我們這漫談席上少了這樣一個人，眞可惜，眞可惜。」我覺得這時的空氣未免太緊張了，我便又轉到另一個題目上去：「您取中國名字呌鄔其山是甚麽意思？」他一面用手寫字，一面說道：「內山的日本音讀起來是「鄔其的莫」，鄔其山便是「內山」的半日音半中國音，而且也是一個很正確的中國姓名，我便很高興地採用了。」他立刻又檢兩份最近的漫談稿給我看，上面署名便用鄔其山。我又轉到個題目：「您很喜歡中國嗎？」「住慣了當然很喜歡，尤其是覺得上海最好—您呢？」我這時覺得頗難置答，但我當時不禁衝口而出道：「也如同您不能忘記日本一樣地愛着中國；但對於上海，我有些不很同樣，我覺得在上海會覺得沒有中國！」他莞爾而不很自如地笑了。他頓了一頓說：「據我觀察，從生活着具體地存在的東西（卽我所說的生活文化方面），我以爲上海潛伏　中國的實際生活文化，任何國家對牠都會無從措手足，但這力量仍瀰漫在上海！二十年的上海觀察，我以爲如此。先生在上海幾年？」我很不安地道：「不過十年。」「那我比你多了十年！」一陣哈哈哈的笑聲又從他闊嘴裏吐出。他那近監眼鏡的光閃動着，表明着他搖頭幌腦地很高興。我最後又問他漫談會這幾日在繼續吧？他說：「二十年的觀察還要繼續到三十年恐怕才够。所以這漫談是不能停止的。除了搜集在「一個日本人的中國觀」書中之外，還有許多，不久或者又會編成一本了。」我這時翻到「中國觀」的最後一頁，看到魯迅先生給譯者的信說：「內山氏的書，是別一種目的，他所舉種種，在未曾揭出之前，我們自己是不覺得的，所以有趣，但倘以此自足郤有害。」這時他的店要上門了，我便向內山先生告辭。</p>

<h3 id="c202">評「馬戲團」 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 濟之</p>
<p>美國著名件家A，辛克萊曾說過：「藝　卽是宜傳」，這的確是一句名言，是給藝術定了最正確的定義。我們可以這樣說：凡是因爲社會下層建築底變革而反映於這一階　底　識形態，其所表達出來的，無論是正面底讚揚，反而底諷刺，或未來底歌頌，共主要的目的都不過是「宜傳而已。不過，這種「宣傳」必須襯托着成熟的技巧而完成！尤其是通過戲劇手段而形象化的時候！能收到普遍而有力的效果。否則，因了技巧手段上底拙劣，不但會得到相反的「反應」，而且也會使藝術」本身失却價値的</p>
<p>「馬戲團」這部影片，它　現了劃時代的新作風。這不但顯示蘇聯對於嶄新藝術的　創造性和進步，而且同時也告訴了我們：新的藝術已臻於成熟時代。</p>
<p>蘇聯獨據着一種不同的經濟領域，其反映於意識方面底意台沃羅基也形成了另一種的範疇。所以，過去在各方面，尤其是在藝術卞面，對於「舊底遺留」往往都取着嚴圳批判和鬥爭的態度：這是在一種新的社會制度建設歷程中所必有的現象。現在的蘇聯幾經奮鬥，在經濟方而已建有了相當的基礎，在社會各方面都形成了　定的狀態；同樣，在藝術方面也脫離了緊張階段，而以新底鬥爭經騐溶滙了舊底技巧，創造了新的作風。「馬戲團」這部片子可說是這新作風底代表作。</p>
<p>木底編者用了象徵主義派底手法，把這　世界所有的不平現象都收到這一部片子里來。更用着新浪漫主義底表現法，在詼諧中灌輸給觀衆以許多「正義」與「眞理」。象微我們這一世界中底侵略者的德國人「克納西次大佐底暴躁，偏狹，和　對於弱小者—「小黑人」象徵着弱小民族—的欺侮，凌辱，對於弱女子「梅麗」—象徵着世界上被剝奪被壓迫的人羣—的威逼，壓迨：這一切，都能很深刻地把我們現實世界描書出來。這三個典型在這片子里短短的活動中，可說是把侵　者底暴虐和被壓迫者底慘痛都活生生地表露於觀衆之前了。而在另一方面，劇作者又用各種人—蘇聯人，喬治亞人，烏克蘭人，猶太人，打度人等—對於無依無告的「小黑人」，不但不因爲「克納西决」底宣佈他是「私生子」而鄙棄他，反都非常撫愛他和傳遞着抱他，而目用各種語言唱「催眠歌」安慰他，這反證出了代表侵略者的克納西决底「殘暴不仁」，和蘇、底各民族對弱小者表同情的吶　。「馬戲團經理」用着詼諧口吻對「梅麗」說：「黑孩子怕什麽？在蘇聯只要孩子是健康的，不　是白的，黃的，紅的，或者粉紅的……都要。」這於輕鬆中又明白表示了蘇聯無國際無民族底眞意。</p>
<p>其决，「馬戲團」底特點是出現了在蘇聯影片中從未見過的「踢踏舞」和「大腿舞」；這在一般人看來，或者像過去說蘇聯資本主義化了一樣，以爲也隨着美國而「大腿」花了！其貴，牠不過採取了舊的舞蹈形式而裝人了新的內容，於娛樂中來宣傳「科學」與國防而已。此中有「降落傘」，有「飛升同溫層」，對於觀衆可說是一種實騐敎育與一般唯美主義的舞蹈是不可同日而語的。</p>
<p>作者旣一貫地用了象徵主義底手法把這部片子化成了世界縮圖。同時，又用了幾個對比的節目把劇情橫斷爲兩面，以象徵着現世界上和平中義者與侵略者及一切舊勢力的對立與競爭。「克納西次」對「馬爾德諾夫」底嫉妒，破壞，及他倆在玻璃窗上對視的「大寫」：這象微了今日世界上侵略者進攻和平主義國家底陰謀。當着「克納西决」在馬戲塲瘋在地向觀衆搶「小黑人」的時候，突然被兩個軍官阻止了他，並使他鍜羽而奔：這又象徵了只有武裝才能制止侵略者底侵略和殘暴。「克納西次」與「梅麗」演過了「月亮飛畀」之後，馬爾德諾夫受了感動，馬上就要想演「飛升同溫層」，雖因「克納西决」底陰謀而遭了失敗，但他却並不氣餒，最後竟獲得了成功。這又氣徵了蘇聯底上進精神與和資本主義的競賽。當着「飛升同溫層」的節目不及上演，而馬戲團老經理爲安慰觀衆底　唣，不得已又把「一九〇三」底「騎獨輪自行車」的老把戲拿出來；雖經他們拚着死命來表演，以致「汗流浹背」，但這種「吃力不討好」的落伍把戲卒不能滿足觀衆底願望；這又象徵着今日的世界已是現代人底領域了，舊底一切應當退讓下來。</p>
<p>作者寓意這樣深刻，細密，但所用的故事本身則非常單純。而又能在這狹小的故事領域中建立各種不同的典型。同時，經過導演底帮助，使劇中每一個人物都能各目代表着一種「性格」，於劇情綏緩的進展中，使觀衆對每　種獨特的「性格」都能慢慢地瞭解起來，認識起來，而於最後得一最深刻的打象。除了「克納西决」這一脚色，因爲要達到「暴怒」這一典型的任務—這種「暴怒」，「在笑」，「悲傷」等脚色是旣吃力而又很難討好的—在而部表情管制上稍較生硬與臉　化些外，其他的脚色可說都能於微妙的契機中點染出他們底特性來。</p>
<p>劇情底結構，因爲導演利用了幾點聰明的手段，使全劇組織緊密而不浪費。如表明「梅麗」自離美後周遊全世界，最後到了蘇聯底「馬戲團」這一段經過情形，則以火車上畫的「地球」使擴大旋轉而成爲馬戲團中底球」，和「馬爾德諾夫」幻想着的「愛神」竟變成了諷刺畫上底「愛神」，與夫其他類同的「速寫」；以及當「馬爾德諾夫」和「克納西决」在玻璃窗上對視中而玻璃上結成了冰花，使「克納西决」底影象隔絕了的「大寫」，這都是利用「心理聯想」底科學方法而用Double-exposure造成的。這里，並不因節省不必要的「節目」而割斷了劇情底發展，破壞了親紮底思，影響了對整個劇情底興趣。導演G.Alexandrov能注意到這些微小的地方，其有助於「馬戲團」底成功，的確不少。不過，關於「史加密京」鬭獅這一段，雖然這不過是利用「詼諧」來陪襯着這「驚險」的節自，以免觀衆心理起突變作用而使主要劇情受到了影饗：但若能把這一「節目」挿到「馬戲團底表演中，則更能顯得自然些。</p>
<p>演員中女主角奧爾洛瓦飾的「梅麗」的確是一個吃力的脚色。她不但要講兩國語言，還要載歌載舞。而且在全劇底過程中「梅麗底遭遇是異常複雜的：有時生命受着迫害，有時又受着榮譽的讚揚；有時受着殘暴者底毒打，有時又有愛人底安慰；有光明的希望使她快樂，又有突來的失望使她悲哀。這一脚色必須於這曲線的進程中保持她那統一的性格，才能達到完滿的結果。而最後，　爾洛瓦却是成功了。</p>
<p>經理女兒「拉雅」這類脚色，在蘇聯底每部影片中都出現過。而演這類典型的演員又都　似有天生成的這樣的「聰明」。她「天眞」，「憨直」，「馬虎」，甚至有些「阿Q」型。或者蘇聯社會中也有這型的人物吧？在戲劇中的諷刺對社會或者就是「敎育」吧。</p>
<p>「馬戲團底經理」這類人物在蘇聯其他影片中也是數見不鮮的。道種「行將就木」的「老頭子」却仍然這樣活潑，詼諧，有生氣，這恐怕只有在蘇聯社會中才找得到這樣忘却了天年的老人吧。</p>
<p>在過去幾部蘇　底影片中，所給我們的是一些帮助瞭解蘇聯的現實材料，或一些未來底理想的暗示。而「馬戲團」則更超出了這些範圍，幷給了我們許多應用的理論與技巧。我們對這些寶貴的敎訓是應當更進一步地來學習的。</p>

<h3 id="c203">怎樣與各國人交際？ <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 魯輝</p>
<p>上海，據說是有三十多個國家人種和華人雜處住居。除了少數的高責人物以外，大概薪給階級的人總多半寄居在弄堂式的房子裏，或在那新型的排列式公寓裏，在那一幢住宅或一層公寓裏，往往包含了許多不同國籍不同省籍的入物。出入行動，往往免不了有和異邦人接洽或周旋等事。同時，因爲歷史則習慣的關係，在上海所謂特區（卽兩租界的今名，初開闢時稱夷民居留地）內，又儼然是分了國籍區域似的。例如虹口多半是日本人的聚集處，而白俄人又聚居於霞飛路一帶，朝鮮人多聚居於勞神父路一帶等等。常然，在特區中，只要你是一個照章納稅者，你便可以隨意在那里選　住宅，並無國籍之限。誰也不能干涉或拒絕你。不過，因此你便有意無意地必須要用相當常識和手腕來應付你那居留地的左鄰右舍了。或者，爲了職業的關係，而不得不每日要在異邦人的機關團體中服務：或者，臨時的酬應和突然發生的意外事等等，也使你必須與異邦人接觸。或者，這以後便成了朋友。其他，如逛公園，遊舞塲，跑霞飛路及北四川路，這其問，接觸異邦人士的機會便更多了。</p>
<p>我們先說日本與蘇聯。這兩個國家的人物，在習慣和思想上，確是相差得很遠的。但我們不必去管他那些：我們只問自己應該怎樣對待他們而已，在上海蘇聯的人民比較少，上海所稱的「羅宋」人是指白俄，這些人男的多半做電氣工程，巡捕房，開公共汽車，做査票，保鑣等工作；女的除開店外，多半是做侍女舞女或變相的妓女。在上海和我們接觸的所謂俄國人，便多半是這些先生女士們。在你和他們交際的時候，你不必去向他們誇奬甚麽五年計劃，甚麼社會主義，甚麽大入物列寧，高爾基。最多，談些托爾斯泰，契訶夫或者歌王夏理亞賓等等好了。說到日本入，在上海的虹口區域中，差不多到處都是。工商業方面的入們非常客氣，據久住上海的日本人說：『他們是拜金主義者，只要有錢，呌你一聲什麽好聽的稱呼都可以。』不過，你和他們交際時得注意他們的風俗習慣，比仿你到日本朋友家裏，看見做丈夫的人傲然與客坐談或共食，做妻子的只能如同下女一樣傳盃遞盞，添飯倒茶，服侍唯謹。那是他們一向的例行公事，你可不能以爲這與中國不同，認爲你朋友過於封建，而去招呼那位嫂夫人，或者再三要她一同來吃才肯動筷子等，這在我國是一種禮節，但在他們家裏却反而要使那位嫂夫人爲難了。你只有不去睬她爲妙　還有，你須預先想到到日本人家必　脫去鞋子。幾天不洗的脚和破了的襪子等事先都要注意到　否則，到了臨時，人家的太太小姐照規矩跪在門口伺候你脫鞋時，你豈不是要窘不可言？</p>
<p>至於和素稱紳士派的英國人人交際呢？那你首先要注意儀　了。這並不是說要穿得如何考究，華麗；而是說：整潔，莊嚴。頭髮要梳得光光的，短鬚一定要薙去，若要留一撇，也要把其餘處所修得淸淸爽爽。到他家裏，要知道尊重女眷，見面必須問安，有甚麽請托必須致謝。　與美國女人交際一樣，但言語可更要謹愼宛轉些。因爲美國人說話向來直爽快捷，英國人則比較的和緩客氣。所以有人說：『你到英國人家，必須先找到他們的盥洗室。整容，洗手，刷衣裳，擦皮鞋等事，一進門都要趕快做完。』這確是經騐之談哩！</p>
<p>與美國人和法國人交際比較的可以隨便些。但兩國父有不同之處。目前的交際多半是有女眷參加的。美國入尊重女子，比仿坐下來，必須男人先請女人坐，走路時必須攙扶。如果兩個男子和一個女子同走，必須讓這女子走在當中而兩男子同時攙扶或挽着她的手。如果一個男子同兩個女子同行，那這個男子照例應該攙扶兩個女子。如果兩個女子相挽着，那這個男子便要忽左忽右地招呼她們，爲這兩女子像一個嚮導似的服</p>

<p>— 聞</p>
<p>著名世界的好萊塢紅星葛蘭泰，嘉寳女士說：「健美是我們的生命錢！是我們衣食的供給者！」本來，一個電影女明星除掉藝術是她們所需要者外，健壯的體格，美麗的容貌，更爲她們所迫切需要，好係牡丹與綠葉，是要互相扶持的。一位遊歷好萊塢的記者曾拿「健美如何能使之保持長久」的話，去請問這位神秘女郎嘉寶。據她談：「每日早眠早起，以睡至八小時爲適宜。每日沐港一决，的十分鐘，用微溫水，水中和牛乳及食鹽少許，浴後用一種美身液塗擦遍體，以至紅潤爲度。運動在本人的經騐，以打老爾夫爲最相宜，或者駕自由車。因爲容貌的美麗完全是皮肉所造就，皮肉又是血液所養成，血液又是飲食的結晶，所以它的主宰還是在營養上，所以我很注意飲食，其大略如下：（一）選擇富有蛋白質的菜類，脂肪品不宜多食，因恐其易使人肥胖。（二）每日早晨下午各飲鮮牛乳一杯。（三）不飲濃茶，不吸香烟。（四）飯後晱水菓少許，以維持胃腸間淸潔，並可免除消化小良及一切內疾。</p>
<p>至於化妝方面，其好壞完全是要憑各人經騐和所選的化妝美容用品之優劣了。不過我可以貢獻一點小意見如下：</p>
<p>（一）化妝的時間以晨起餐後爲最適宜，化妝之前要把一切心事拋開，心緒不寗是很有影饗於美容的！塗粉時，先以卡脫絲油遍施面部，因爲可以使之平勻，且免使面部受粉鉛之侵襲而引起斑點。（二）眼圈宜淡黑，濃則顯不自然。（三）胭脂日間宜紅，晚間宜黃，口唇則日晚均宜深紅。（四）面部切忌抹擦任何香水，因其含有酒精質，刺激性甚烈，有損皮膚。（五）夜間就寢時，面部亦宜塗脂肪油少許，可以使皮膚養成白嫩。如面部發生斑疹或皺紋等，宜立卽赴美容醫院施行手術，免其滋長。而且我覺得每一個女明星都應當認得一位稔熟的美容醫師才可以保持她的靑春。」</p>

<p>務。至於法國人呢？法國女入如果同你做了朋友，往往會使你受寵若驚地覺得未免太親密了。同時，如果你的女眷同法國男朋友在一起，那又會使你看不慣，使你的女眷們或者會覺得那人是失禮呢。其實，這是法國朋友們習慣如此，他們和她們都一樣的沒有壞的存心。所以，在這一點上是要特別注意的。據說在巴黎，竟眞有大家換老婆過日子的交際，但那也是極少數的事，法國人的確把男女之間的糾葛監得平淡，然而，在人家國度裏，他們也很講友誼和禮貌的。</p>
<p>再說德國。爲了歐戰關係，有一個時期我們很少與德國人接觸了。不過在工廠，在醫院，這一民族的男女工作人員總佔多數。近年來接觸的機會又多了。他們和她們都非常盡忠於職務，在職務上對任何人都很熱情而細心。交際時不多言不多語，喜歡運動和技術的漫談，和他們交際也是很有益的。</p>

<h3 id="c205">怎樣學習寫生 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 敦</p>
<p>繪畫的確有趣，尤其是「寫生」。因爲材料現成，只要自己眼明心細，對於美醜有確切的判斷，便什麽都可描寫，而描寫出來的，都可成爲美好的作品。</p>
<p>「寫牛」，普通分兩種：一種是「靜物寫生」，一種是「風景寫生」。靜物寫生是學繪畫者必經的一步。初學的人總是先畫石膏模型。我們先預備一個三角木架，高度與自己站立時的胸部相等。木架前面的兩隻脚上左右多做幾個對稱的孔，然後預備一塊大的厚紙或薄薄的木板，用木柱穿入脚上的孔中，將這厚紙或薄塊托住，它的位置須與眼的視綫適合，我們要描寫的東西，可掛於對方的牆上，或擺在對方的一個高台上；這位置是不能隨意亂擺的。初學的人須將畫材擱在有從一方面來的光綫的地方，即是有橫邊的光錢的地方；因爲，在這樣的光綫上，容易分出物體的明暗，感得物狀的「立體」及「距離」來。這　　置妥當了，然後才開始畫：用釘將畫紙（普通呌圖畫紙）釘在那塊厚紙或薄板上，如初學，便直接用木炭在紙上將眼前的畫材描出來。但這麼照樣畫出來便算爲「傑作」了嗎？不對，若一筆不苟地這麽照樣描寫，那簡直成了一種板滯的「說明圖」。繪畫和寫文章一樣，必須在自己的作品裏賦予一個一靈魂」：那便是，在用木炭塗上書紙之前，須先把畫材中的各部分的形狀，光暗，色彩等，都得仔細地加以觀察，深深地印在自己的腦筋上，然後再加以實在的描寫。先領會了畫材全體的姿式及情趣，才能在物歡的色彩，明暗及綫的全體構成中，發見它的神韻。這種「發見」，說起來似乎很抽象，其實只要多練習，多觀摩，便會於無意中獲得了的。</p>
<p>若果所取的材料比較複雜，在一個短時期內寫不完，擱下，隔日再繼續下去也可以的。但每次的繪畫時間，須定在相同的時候，如第一决是在上午開始的，以後都須在上午繼續工作：因爲上下午的光綫不同，物體上所呈顯的明暗自然也不同了；這對於繪畫有根底的人倒沒有多大的關係；但對於初學者，却有因光綫不同，同一的畫材會現出各種不同的現象的困難來。</p>
<p>其决，如要着色的話，除了以上各點，還須注意到畫材的色調，如是石膏像或磁器等類的東西，因爲它自身是白色的，若擺在白的背景上，便難以顯出物體的凹凸來，所以畫材和背景的顏色須十分分明，同時還要諧調；比如所要畫的是個白色的磁盆，盆內盛着蜜橘和蘋果，爲要顯明其色彩，可用一張淡藍色（卽湖水色）的布襯在背後，因此可得各物的色彩的　鮮明的印象。</p>
<p>要着色的畫，先用木炭，依適當的構圖，將大體的輪廓描在畫紙或畫布上，畫好了，將木炭的重灰，輕輕掃去；（有繪畫根基的，往往不用木炭，直接就以油畫筆，蘸起顏色來描輪廓）再就照原物的色彩來一筆一筆塗上去。在紫描（只用木炭畫而不着色的）上，常然是用木炭來描光的濃度或陰影，但在色彩的描寫上，那就須以色調的對照來表現這些部分了。</p>
<p>無論是素描或色彩描寫，除了「光暗」「色彩」須注意之外，還有物體各部的比例是絲毫不能忽略的。我們常見市上的廣告畫，往往一頂帽子戴在胸膛上或手臂長過了兩腿的怪現象，這些都是出於不注意物體各部的比例的緣故。習繪畫必須學「透視學」，便是要糾正這種錯誤，不過若我們沒有多少功夫來硏究這一步，我們在繪畫時，便以手中的筆來作尺子，將物體的各部量個大概。量時，不必跑近前去，抱起物體來量，我們只站得遠遠的，　着一隻眼，將筆桿舉起，望過去，看它的每一部佔筆桿的幾分之幾，再和自己的靈上的各部比較比較就行了。</p>
<p>靜物寫生，有了相常訓練之後，便可學習「風景寫生」了。</p>
<p>風景寫生最難的，是光暗的不易捉摸，因爲風景寫生大都在戶外，而戶外的光綫，明暗異常複雜，但若於靜物寫生有了相當的基礎，這種困難也還容易免除的、</p>
<p>在戶外，日光是不停地在移動，因此名物身上所呈顯的明暗部份或其側影也時時在移動。比如一棵樹的影子，初見時在這裏，一轉瞬間，便已伸長到那邊去了。所以寫生的人，須在光景未有十分變異內，儘可能地描寫，如感　那光景和初來時的相較，相差實在太多了，那就不宜再繼續下去，寗可立刻停止，到明日相同的時候再來工作，不然，全體的畫，東改西改，會陷到全都要不得的境地的。</p>
<p>如果走到一個地方，一時决不定要取那一部份作爲畫材，那末，可預先用鉛筆在寫生簿（有專賣的）上，將所看見的分描幾部的大概。幾部相互一比，便可决定你要取的一部了。有了材料，然後和靜物寫生一樣，先理解那要描寫的部分的一種構成。比如那一部分內有條小溪，溪的一旁有幾棵疏疏落落的樹，樹影幽靜地倒映在水中，那一旁滿生了茸茸的靑草，前面是寬廣的田野，最遠處（遠景）有如煙如織的漠漠的樹林…描寫這，先在畫紙上或畫布上，界定一條地平綫，以决定遠景的位置，然後以這地平綫作出發點，來佈置近景，及主要物象，如樹木，小溪，溪岸等等的位置。决定了，先繪大體的輪廓，如着色，便先染天空的色彩，以後依次繪中景及遠景。自然，在繪這些的時候，不單要注意物狀，還要時時注意到明暗的對服和各景距離的分別。不然，各物就會貼在一塊，顯不出立體的形狀來。</p>
<p>在强列的日光下寫生，須使畫面避免日光的直射。在强烈的日光下，可用寫生傘，揷在畫架（就用靜物寫生的畫架）旁以遮日光，如不用傘，可在樹蔭下，借樹葉的遮蔽。如畫面前方有强烈的日光，或地面有强光的反射，都於寫生不相宜，應力求避免。還有，如遇大風，畫架安不穩固的時候，可尋一個石塊懸在三個脚的中間，賴重心的力使畫架不致被風吹倒。</p>
<p>以上所說，都只是寫生畫的一個大槪。這原是一門專門學問，須有長時間來硏究的。不過，如我們略爲知道一點門徑，再加以勤於練習，也會有優良的成績出來的。如法國的米勒，窮到連木炭和畫紙都買不起，那裏還有錢入學校聽「透視學」和「繪畫論」呢？然而他以可憐的煤屑和破紙畫的「晚鐘」，「拾種者」，「羊羣等作品，至今已成了無價之寶了。</p>

<h3 id="c206">列強的化學戰爭準備 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— 畢嘉</p>
<p>大家知道，毒瓦斯，烟幕彈，燃燒彈等化學兵器，在一九一四—一八年的世界大戰中已經實際地使用了。戰後列强更努力從事化學戰爭的準備，它們的軍事專家和科學者隨時都在宣傳化學兵器的巨大作用，隨時都在努力發明新的殺人利器。英國夫拉將軍曾說：「砲彈落在地上，卽刻就「死了」；而化學物質的微分子投放出來，却還能繼續「生存着」，它不論在地上或地下，就是經過幾日的時間，也會給與一切東西以可怕的打擊。」意大利的德維將軍也指出化學兵器可以送到極遠的地方，發生極大的作用，說它不僅能攻擊敵人的前方，而且還可以侵擾其後方，因而更斷言航空化學兵器的出現將使戰爭諸形態爲之一變。這樣，在快將到來的世界大戰中，化學兵器所演的任務之重大也就可想而知了。</p>
<p>列强化學戰爭的凖備首先從化學工業方面表現出來。大戰以後，帝國主義列强基於化學兵器應用的經騐，都努力創設和發展與化學兵器生產有直接關係的化學工業部門。這些工業部門所生產的，主要是鹽素，砒素，硫黃，人造絲，窒素，亞尼林染料及其他種種化學藥品。近年以來，由於世界形勢的日益緊張，帝國主義列强化學品之生產能力顯示出了可驚的增加。例如鹽素，最近列强可能的生產能力就有如下的表示——</p>
<p>美國　六〇〇·〇〇〇噸</p>
<p>法國　一〇〇·〇〇〇噸</p>
<p>日本　一三〇·〇〇〇噸</p>
<p>德國　一五〇·〇〇〇噸</p>
<p>英國　一〇〇·〇〇〇噸</p>
<p>波蘭　一〇〇·〇〇〇噸</p>
<p>可是，各國鹽素的實際生產額却表現出了這樣的狀態——</p>
<p>美國　三〇〇、、〇〇〇噸</p>
<p>法國　七〇—七五、〇〇〇噸</p>
<p>日本　七〇—八〇、〇〇〇噸</p>
<p>德國　一〇〇—三五、〇〇〇噸</p>
<p>英國　七〇—七五、〇〇〇噸</p>
<p>波蘭　三〇—四〇、〇〇〇噸</p>
<p>這樣，若將列强鹽素生產能力與其實際牛產額（尤其是消費額）相較起來，那其不均衡的現象便可明白看出了。這種可驚的不平衡的表現，卽充分說明了列强對於鹽素生產和準備的努力情形</p>
<p>列强中對於化學工業的發展最努力的，要算東方的日本和西方的德國了。在日本方面，首先是人造絲工業的發展爲世人所注意。據調査，在最近三年間，日本人造絲工業便</p>

<h3 id="e1">Bandit Cavalry Fiercely Assaults Suiyuan Eastern Defenses; Harassment Lasted All Night, Repelled Only at 4 AM Yesterday; Enemy Aircraft, Nine in Total, Reconnoiter Pingdi Quan; Fu Zuoyi Returns to Suiyuan After Inspecting the Front <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) A telegram from Jining reports: Li Shouxin and Wang Ying's cavalry units, stationed in Shangdu, have joined with over a thousand newly recruited bandits, expanding their line along the Daqinggou front in Taolin, launching a fierce assault on our Suiyuan eastern defenses. They engaged in fierce battles with Zhao Chengzhou's cavalry division. Most of the attacking bandits were cavalry, moving unpredictably, causing constant disruption to our lines all night. They were finally repelled at 4 AM on the 14th, with our defenses remaining vigilant. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Fu Zuoyi returned to Suiyuan from Jining at 4 AM on the 14th. Nine aircraft from a certain side, forming a large formation, flew over Jining at 7 AM on the 14th for reconnaissance. They then circled low over Hong'ertu for about an hour before flying away. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A military strategist familiar with the situation in Suiyuan said: if disturbances by the puppet troops in Suiyuan escalate into a formal war, Wuchuan and Xinghe will be the bandits' target destinations. This is because Bailingmiao, Pangjiang, and Shangdu are all bases for the Mongolian puppet troops, making cavalry incursions very easy. If Wuchuan falls, Guihua will be immediately destabilized. If Xinghe falls, it will be difficult to secure Jining, and as a result, the Ping-Sui Railway will inevitably be cut, isolating Shanxi and Suiyuan – a likely outcome. Therefore, although the current bandit attacks are aimed at Taolin, they are actually intended to divert our forces, after which a flanking force will secretly attack our side. Fu Zuoyi is good at defense, and if the puppet troops do not openly attack, the Suiyuan army is sufficient to withstand them. What is feared is that a certain side will recklessly use its air force to bomb our rear, causing us to be unable to attend to both ends and lose contact. Therefore, joint defense of Chahar and Suiyuan is an urgent matter that must be addressed. (14th Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) For the safety of the Ping-Sui Railway, one hundred experienced police officers have been selected from the entire railway to form a Ping-Sui Railway Protection Team. After one month of training starting on the 5th of this month, they will be dispatched to various locations. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Besides aircraft continuing reconnaissance of the Chinese army's front lines in eastern Suiyuan, the overall situation remains calm. Travelers arriving here from Pingdi Quan denied rumors that aircraft had dropped bombs on Pingdi Quan yesterday morning. They claimed that yesterday, the Suiyuan Eastern Air Force's activities consisted only of several reconnaissance planes soaring over Pingdi Quan, Taolin, and Xinghe for quite some time. (14th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain side received a telegram from Suiyuan stating that eight enemy planes flew over the Pingdi Quan area this morning for reconnaissance, flying very low and circling for about an hour before flying towards the northeast. The puppet bandit army's leaders have been holding meetings in Bailingmiao for days, actively preparing for military action. To strengthen their forces, Zhang Hai Peng specifically telegraphed a certain side from Bailingmiao requesting a large troop reinforcement. A large number of puppet troops, approximately four thousand, carrying heavy weapons and aircraft, have arrived in Duolun from the Rehe border. After sufficient food and supplies are prepared, they will head towards Shangdu. Bao Yueqing's Mongolian bandit cavalry, approximately five to six hundred strong, have been entrenched near Taolin and Xinghe in eastern Suiyuan for days, planning to seize an opportunity to create disturbances. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Information from concerned parties indicates that an invasion of Suiyuan Province by puppet bandit troops has become inevitable. The puppet bandits' troop movements and deployments have reached their final stages. Small-scale skirmishes are constantly occurring at the outposts in Sui Dong, Xinghe, and Taolin. Our side's morale is extremely high, and the authorities have made ample preparations for border defense. Approximately four to five thousand puppet troops from western Rehe have been advancing towards Shangdu in northern Chahar for days. Transport vehicles are constantly moving between Jiapusi Temple and Bailingmiao. Aircraft from a certain side are flying daily to Taolin, Xinghe, and our positions for reconnaissance, paying particular attention to Pingdi Quan. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Duolun is now the military transportation hub for the Rehe-Chahar puppet troops. Zhang Hai Peng's puppet army, numbering three to four thousand, has been concentrating in that area from Dage for days, gradually advancing towards Shangdu. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Information from concerned parties: Sha Wang, due to Wang Ying and other bandit puppet troops' attempts to go to western Suiyuan along the northern Daqing Mountains, and to prevent residual bandits from Ningbian from crossing the river and causing disturbances, specifically convened a meeting of the authorities of various leagues and banners yesterday to discuss prevention measures. The results are said to have been decisive. It is also heard that the situation on the Xinghe and Taolin border has become extremely dangerous recently. Several tanks from a certain side are currently moving from Shangdu to the front lines to lead any attack. According to those familiar with the Mongolian situation, northern Chahar is bitterly cold, and the snowy season will arrive in an instant. The bandit puppet troops have little food and difficult transportation, so it is in their interest to fight quickly. If our side builds deep trenches and high walls, firmly defends, and clears the fields, internal changes will occur within the puppet bandit army within a month.

<p>(Tianjin) It is reported that the American Consulate in this area has ordered all American citizens in Suiyuan and Ningxia provinces to move to safe locations in case of a serious situation. Recently, the Chinese government, given the unrest in Suiyuan, Ningxia, and Qinghai provinces, has informed various foreign ambassadors in China to instruct their citizens residing in the three provinces to leave the country. This action by the American authorities is in accordance with the Chinese government's request. It is also learned that an official from the American Consulate in this area has departed today for Zhangjiakou to investigate the situation in eastern Suiyuan. There are a total of thirteen American adults and six young children in Suiyuan, and four adults in Ningxia. (14th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) There is considerable concern here regarding the safety of the American missionary Mr. and Mrs. Wiens. This is because unconfirmed news was received today stating that Mr. and Mrs. Wiens have been kidnapped by bandits in Zhaozishan (transliterated) area, east of Guihua in Suiyuan. The American authorities, however, have not yet received any news regarding Mr. and Mrs. Wiens. (14th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Students from fourteen colleges and universities in Tianjin have launched a donation campaign to console the soldiers in Suiyuan. Nanyang College has stipulated that each student donate at least one yuan, and they will also fast for one day on the 15th, using the money saved as funds to console the army.

<p>(Tianjin) Educational circles in Beiping and Tianjin are scheduled to meet in Beiping on the 16th to discuss support for the Suiyuan army and methods of consolation. Presidents of various colleges and universities in Tianjin went to Beiping on the evening of the 14th to participate. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Faculty and staff of the Huiwen Girls' High School in Nanjing, because bandit puppet troops invading Suiyuan are increasingly urgent, and while our soldiers at the front have the determination to defend the land, they still rely on the people in the rear for a steady supply of materials, have specifically donated one day's income and sent it directly to Fu Zuoyi to purchase leather clothing for the soldiers. The students of the school also plan to economize and continue to donate. (14th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Zhang Zizhong, accompanied by Cheng Xixian, inspected the city's security team at the public stadium at 1 PM on the 14th. Zhang also instructed on the key points of winter defense. He continued to review the city police on the morning of the 15th. Winter defense martial law began at 6 PM. Cheng Xixian said that this year's winter defense measures are slightly different from previous years. More than ten temporary defense posts will be set up in quiet areas of the city, each staffed by a platoon of the security team. The remaining battalions will remain concentrated and stand by for temporary mobilization in case of unexpected events. It has recently been reported that Cheng Guorui has secretly come to Tianjin to engage in activities, and other frustrated individuals are also plotting unrest. These people are all looking for a way out due to financial difficulties, and their only solution is to disrupt public order. Although the city's military and police forces are relatively small before the additional recruitment is implemented, they still have sufficient strength to deal with thugs.

Ambassador Xu made another earnest and clear explanation of our government's attitude, especially clarifying various points where Japan misunderstood our country's position, so that the Japanese government could fully and correctly consider our country's position. Arita seemed not to fully understand all the points mentioned by Ambassador Xu, but promised to reply after receiving a detailed report and reconsidering. (14th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the Asahi Shimbun, China has not only rejected Japan's proposals on North China and anti-communism, but has recently even insisted that the conditions already accepted by China must be attached before drafting clauses. It is also heard that the National Government is seriously concerned about the situation in eastern Suiyuan, expressing that this situation has caused considerable annoyance to the Chinese people, making it extremely difficult for the current negotiations to continue. The report continued that officials from the Army, Navy, and Foreign Ministries held a meeting on the afternoon of the 13th. Isogai, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Army Ministry, Toyota, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Navy Ministry, and Kuwashima, Director of the East Asia Bureau of the Foreign Ministry, and Uemura, Head of the First Section, all attended the meeting. They carefully discussed everything for as long as three hours.

<p>(Nanjing) Luo Jialun, president of Central University, published an article in Suiyuan on the 12th consoling armed comrades. The original text is recorded as follows: "Armed comrades of all armies on the front line of Suiyuan, the rivers and mountains stained with our blood must permanently belong to us. The survival and honor of a nation can only be maintained by the heads and blood of its own people. This time, I have seen the life of the officers and soldiers in the borderlands, and I have realized that the strange flowers of our nation's revival are being nurtured in the fortresses of withered grass and yellow sand, waiting to bloom. I firmly believe that you will soon be able to make the world realize that we Chinese men are still lions, not sheep. The blood of our countrymen all over the country is willing to rush to the trenches outside the Great Wall to help you eliminate the cold and encourage loyalty, courage, and indignation. Now we are preparing to offer 1,000 yuan in national currency, originally intended to be a drunk before you kill the enemy, but thinking that this is a long-term struggle, not a one-time generous sacrifice, so I am willing to change these small sums into medical and health equipment for the sake of your brave warriors to create and fight again. Now the fate of the entire nation is in our hands, and we all have nowhere to escape between heaven and earth. Only the rivers and mountains stained with our blood are more worthy of our and our descendants' praise and love. I sincerely and warmly pay my respects to you, and I would also like to pay my respects to you on behalf of the 3,000 faculty and staff and students of National Central University.

<p>(Nanjing) Prince A came to Nanjing to visit the central authorities and report on the situation in Mongolia. The results of the contact were satisfactory. He is now eager to return to Suiyuan to handle political affairs due to the tense situation in Suiyuan, so he left Nanjing at 4:20 PM on the 14th. Zhao Pi Lian, Chu Ming Shan, Jiang Yang Zheng, and more than 60 representatives from the Central Party Headquarters, the Ministry of Military Affairs, and the municipal government came to the station to see him off. Prince A's chartered car, a total of three, was attached to the Ping-Pu train, and after passing Xuzhou, it turned to the Longhai Road to Zhengzhou, awaiting instructions from Chairman Chiang, then turned to the Zheng-Tai Road to Taiyuan to visit Director Yan and seek instructions on everything, before returning to Suiyuan. According to Prince A's remarks to reporters before his departure, his impression of the southern tour was excellent, and the unity of the country inspired people. The situation in Suiyuan has been tense recently, but I think the situation will not expand, because Chairman Fu has always paid close attention to provincial defense, and the deployment is very solid. Now that the troops are well-trained and the food is sufficient, Chairman Fu has long been determined to resist and will never let the enemy cross the line. As for the responsible officials in the Mongolian banners, they have all made preparations early. If the enemy invades, they will not hesitate to fight to the end at any cost and will never lightly abandon an inch of land. Prince A's words were passionate and admirable. (14th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Prince A came to Nanjing for half a month and his mission is over. On the morning of the 14th, he bid farewell to the heads of various courts, departments, and committees, and in the afternoon he took a car with his family and entourage to return north. The Mongolian Committee sent staff to escort him north. Mr. and Mrs. Agan took a train from Shijiazhuang to Taiyuan to visit the Sui Jing Director Yan Xishan. The entourage went directly back to Suiyuan. Chairman Chiang also sent Prince A four cars, silks, and a lot of daily necessities. According to Ba Wenjun, director of the Sui Political Council's Beijing office, Prince A's visit to the south was excellent, and the central government's generous treatment was deeply appreciated. After arriving in Taiyuan to visit Director Yan, he returned to Suiyuan immediately. Because he had already visited and made a decision before coming to Beijing at the end of last month, there was not much delay. The central government has not yet approved the construction costs of the Sui Political Council, but it is expected that it can be proposed at the next meeting. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e49">The Outbreak of the War in Eastern Suiyuan <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>According to news in recent days, the enemy's command of the puppet bandit army to attack eastern Suiyuan has already broken out. This is exactly the same as in the past, when Jinzhou was taken, the Great Wall was attacked, Rehe was annexed, Luandong was ceded, and then the six counties of Chahar North were taken. On the one hand, diplomatic negotiations were used to create a smokescreen, and on the other hand, iron hands were extended to seize actual benefits. When the effect of the smokescreen has been fully exploited, what inevitably follows is a new military advancement. The outbreak of the war in eastern Suiyuan has given us another example.</p>
<p>The enemy's steps to attack Suiyuan began to prepare after the six counties of Chahar North were invaded and seized this spring. The activities of the puppet Manchukuo army of Zhang Haipeng and Li Shouxin, the purchase of De Wang, the gradual expansion of the puppet Mongolian army, and the penetration of enemy spies into Inner Mongolia Northwest, have hardly stopped for a moment in the past year. Only because the overall situation in the five provinces of North China is very serious, coupled with the fact that such news cannot be disclosed smoothly in the newspapers, the urgent situation in this regard has not received full attention from the people of the country. But in the past month or two, the enemy's activities on the Sui border have been actively intensified. People with knowledge have already put forward the call to firmly defend this "first line of national defense." Chairman Fu of Sui Province and the generals and soldiers under him have also built fortifications and prepared to defend against the enemy. Sure enough, the diplomatic smokescreen had just passed, and military aggression immediately began.</p>
<p>This time, the enemy's attack was led by the puppet Manchukuo army and the puppet Mongolian army, with the main base in Zhangbei in the rear. The military supplies transported from the northeast are concentrated here. The progress of the invasion is divided into three routes, namely the Zhuo Shihai department of the puppet De Wang, the Li Shouxin department of the puppet Manchukuo army, and the Wang Ying department of the puppet Mongolian bandit army. One route attacks Baotou, one route attacks Wuping, and one route attacks Pingdiquan, and its central target is Guihua. The total number of these puppet bandit troops is about 30,000 to 40,000. Their combat effectiveness is not strong, but their attacks are covered by Japanese military aircraft and supported by Japanese military tanks. Therefore, although we say that this is an invasion by puppet bandit troops, in fact, this has already indicated that the war between countries has repeatedly broken out.</p>
<p>We must not ignore the seriousness of this war. Suiyuan is indeed "the last barrier in North China and the gateway to the northwestern provinces." If Suiyuan falls again, not only will Shanxi and Ningxia be in a state of crisis, but the entire North China will also be like an arrow in the chest and irreparable. The matter is urgent. If we do not make up our minds now and do our best to save Suiyuan, then the fall of the territory in the future will be faster than the land that has already been lost.</p>
<p>The generals and soldiers of Suiyuan are sincerely patriotic and determined to defend the territory. There are already many facts to prove this. However, according to news in recent days, the morale of the front is strong, but there is still a shortage of food. In this regard, assistance should be given immediately so that they have no worries about the supply and replenishment of food, machinery, and even manpower. Now, students in Beiping and fellow villagers of Sui Province living in Beiping have implemented a food fast to support the generals and soldiers fighting for national survival in eastern Suiyuan. I hope that the whole country will follow suit. This is the last opportunity to save the country, and there can be no more waiting.</p>

<p>(New York) According to Federal Emergency Relief Administrator Harry Hopkins, the total number of people receiving relief on October 15 was 3,498,000, a decrease of 28% from the peak of 5,316,000 on May 15, 1935. The number of people receiving relief always increases in winter, but Hopkins predicts that this winter can be reduced by one million people compared with last year. (13th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>(Washington) The Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve Board, and the Securities and Exchange Commission, under the direction of President Roosevelt today, began drafting a bill to control $700,000,000 of foreign investment in the United States to avoid adverse effects on foreign exchange and domestic securities markets. President Roosevelt declared that a large influx of foreign capital could create a dangerous situation. He also expressed great concern about foreign purchases of U.S. securities disrupting the monetary agreements between the U.S., Britain, and France. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Landis stated that the commission has no direct power to deal with this situation and is therefore concerned along with other government agencies. He added that experts from the commission and the Federal Reserve Board have been closely monitoring this matter for the past six months. These experts receive daily reports from New York brokers regarding foreign purchases of securities. He declined to comment on whether the current market trend is healthy, stating only that the Securities and Exchange Commission is not overly worried about the current situation, but is very uneasy about the current activity in the securities market.

<p>(Paris) Today's session of the Chamber of Deputies was extraordinarily tumultuous. The deputies debated fiercely and finally passed a vote of confidence in the government. The debate concerned the past of Interior Minister Salengro's military service in the European War. According to a newspaper report, Salengro was a coward who deserted his post in the war. A commission of inquiry appointed by the government refuted this claim. When a deputy announced that Salengro was a revolutionary who opposed military preparedness before the war, a great uproar erupted. Then Premier Blum took the floor, and right-wing deputies shouted sarcastic remarks such as, "The victor of the Great War will speak!" Left-wing deputies, enraged, rushed to the seats of the right-wing deputies, climbed over desks and threw punches. At one point, more than fifty deputies were involved in a brawl. The speaker, unable to restore order, announced a recess. Many deputies suffered swollen eyes, and several had injured shins and required treatment. The session resumed shortly afterward. When the debate on Salengro's conduct concluded, a vote of confidence in the government was proposed and passed by a vote of 374 to 201. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The right-wing deputies today arbitrarily slandered Premier Blum in the Chamber of Deputies, leading to a brawl and the suspension of the session. When the Chamber of Deputies discussed the wartime record of Interior Minister Salengro, Premier Blum rose to speak, and right-wing deputies shouted "Dirty Jew" to obstruct him. Several left-wing deputies crossed the aisles and attacked the right-wing deputies, resulting in a free-for-all of punches and kicks. Chaos ensued, and Speaker Herriot announced an adjournment. The fighting continued, and order was finally restored by the Chamber of Deputies police. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>

<h3 id="e56">German Government Announces Retrieval of Internal River Navigation Rights, Final Restrictions of the Peace Treaty Abolished <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>(Berlin) The German government, at 1:00 PM today, notified the fourteen nations of Britain, France, Italy, Belgium, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, Lithuania, Romania, Yugoslavia, the Netherlands, and Hungary, that it was abolishing Chapter Twelve of Part II of the Treaty of Versailles, which concerned regulations for navigation on rivers within Germany. According to these regulations, the Elbe, Oder, and other rivers within Germany, as well as the Rhine, Danube, and Niemen, which border other countries, were to be considered international rivers. Vessels of all nations would be free to navigate these rivers, and an international commission would be established to oversee the implementation of this navigation system. The German government's action clearly indicates that it no longer recognizes this commission. According to official sources here, the government's action is purely politically motivated, with the aim of restoring the country's rightful sovereignty over its rivers. However, the navigation systems of certain rivers, such as the Elbe and Rhine, will not be changed. As for the ports of Hamburg and Stettin, which have traditionally been free ports available for the free use of Czechoslovakia, this will continue unchanged. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>(London) After receiving this notification, political figures in Britain predict that the government will likely engage in negotiations with the German government soon. They believe that this action by Germany will inevitably have a significant impact on the trade issues of many countries involved. Political figures generally do not approve of Germany's actions but are not surprised, as Germany has been preparing for weeks to remove the last restrictions imposed on it by the Treaty of Versailles, so this action was expected. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Here, there is no excessive surprise at Hitler's recent actions. Although it is recognized that Hitler's move is no different in principle from Germany's disregard for other clauses of the Treaty of Versailles, in practice, it will not lead to any changes. It is said that France has no practical way to utilize the navigation rights permitted in the treaty. Hitler's move may affect Czech shipping on the Elbe to Hamburg and the North Sea, the barge industry along the Rhine River in the Netherlands, and other international routes. All of these shipping industries will likely suffer a significant blow, as they will now be subject to any regulations imposed by Germany. (Reuters, 14th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The Secretariat of the League of Nations, following the resolution of the League Assembly in July of this year, requested opinions from member states regarding amendments to the Covenant. Responses have been received from various governments one after another, and the Belgian government's reply was also received recently and made public today by the Secretariat of the League of Nations. The Belgian reply proposes that certain articles of the Covenant, especially Article 16, should be explained in detail. For example, the scope of the obligations and assistance that member states can and should bear to a country that has been invaded must be clearly defined. In addition, the Belgian reply requests that amendments to the Covenant should be adopted using the method used in 1921, preferring to retain the original articles and adopt additional articles separately, rather than revising the entire Covenant. Finally, the Belgian reply urges all countries to join the League of Nations. (Havas, 14th)</p>

<p>(Washington) Major General McHugh, Director of the Technical Service of the Army Department, today submitted a proposal to the Chairman of the House Rivers and Harbors Committee, advocating the construction of a surface aircraft base at Welles Port on Midway Island in the Pacific, at a cost of $500,000. This base will cover 1,200 square feet and will be surrounded by breakwaters, with a canal dug as an entrance to the port. The annual recurring cost will be approximately $15,000. This base was originally intended for the development of commercial aviation, but military authorities have openly stated that it will be of great use to U.S. national defense.

<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt today met with Philippine Resident Commissioner Secretary Berite and former Senator Hawes and informally indicated that he plans to visit the Philippines in the near future. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram from Washington, the United States believes that the Pacific defense restriction treaty should be terminated and has decided to build a powerful air base on Midway Island. Although this development was anticipated, Midway Island is located in the center of the Pacific and is a strategically important base. Therefore, the Japanese Navy attaches great importance to it. The United States is still adhering to its plan for transoceanic operations. Building a base on Midway Island, which is further west than Hawaii, can be said to be moving its base approximately 800 miles further west. Thus, with Midway Island to the east, the Aleutian Islands to the north, and Luzon Island in the Philippines to the south, the United States is consolidating its encirclement of Japan. The advancement of the U.S. Air Force to Midway Island will shorten the distance to Tokyo to within 2,000 miles. The threat posed by the U.S. Air Force's giant seaplanes stationed there is significant, so the Japanese military authorities are extremely concerned about this development and believe it is necessary to devise comprehensive countermeasures.

The first signal ordered that rum be distributed to all sailors as a token of appreciation. The second signal conveyed a congratulatory message to the fleet and the Portland shore installations. The King said, "I wish to express to the flag officers and commanders my complete satisfaction with all that I have seen. The appearance of the ships and sailors is exceedingly fine. I congratulate you all." The King then left the royal yacht, transferred to the admiral's yacht, and the ships' officers and men lined the decks as the yacht slowly passed along the line. The ships fired a 21-gun salute. The yacht then turned near the flagship Nelson and headed for the harbor. After the guns fell silent, the yacht increased speed and soon arrived at Weymouth pier, where Edward landed, took a car to Weymouth station, and boarded a special train back to London.

<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Eden met last night with Italian Ambassador to Britain Grandi to discuss relations between Britain and Italy for a considerable period of time. It is reported that Eden indicated to Grandi that the British government is prepared to accept the Anglo-Italian Gentleman's Agreement proposed by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and is willing to begin negotiations with the Italian government to conclude this agreement in the shortest possible time. Britain also proposes to divide the Mediterranean into several different spheres of influence. These spheres of influence can be defined by declarations issued separately by the governments concerned. Once the spheres of influence have been demarcated, the governments concerned should promise to respect each other's interests. Before the commencement of formal negotiations on the above proposals, preliminary negotiations should be held between Britain and Italy. The purpose of these preliminary negotiations is to resolve all outstanding issues between the two countries, namely: (1) the Mediterranean shipping route issue; (2) the issue of mutual spheres of influence of Britain and Italy in countries outside Europe; (3) the Suez Canal issue; and (4) the naval balance of power issue. Only after these issues have been resolved can formal negotiations between Britain and Italy begin on this basis. (Havas, 14th)</p>

<p>Madrid. Government and rebel aircraft engaged in two fierce battles in the skies over here today. The result was that the government aircraft were victorious. The rebel aircraft, in addition to eight being shot down, were all repelled. The first battle took place at 8:00 AM. This agency's reporter, O'China, witnessed the event. At that time, ten rebel aircraft appeared in the sky. In order to avoid anti-aircraft guns, they flew very high. Residents of the capital, seeing the enemy aircraft approaching, rushed to underground rooms in various places. At 8:05 AM, fifteen government fighter planes appeared in the sky. The pilots of both sides were extremely skilled. The flight altitude was 2,000 meters at the highest and only 400 meters above the ground at the lowest. The fighting lasted a long time. Residents who had not had time to hide watched the battle in the open air, forgetting the danger. At first, both sides had their successes. Then, one enemy aircraft's wing was hit and shattered, causing it to crash. One pilot inside deployed a parachute and slowly descended. However, it was not known where he landed. Soon after, another rebel aircraft was shot down. At this time, the government aircraft regrouped, numbering fifteen. The crowd on the ground cheered loudly. The remaining eight rebel aircraft attempted to escape but were surrounded by government aircraft. One more was hit and crashed. The government aircraft finally pursued the rebels to the outskirts of Madrid and shot down three more enemy aircraft, bringing the total of rebel aircraft shot down to six. Only four escaped, while no government aircraft were lost. At 3:30 PM, three rebel large bombers appeared in the sky. At that time, the sky was clear and blue. Anti-aircraft guns immediately fired and bombarded the enemy aircraft. About fifteen minutes later, ten rebel light aircraft appeared in the sky. At that time, the ground audience eagerly awaited the government aircraft to respond. In less than a few minutes, ten government aircraft suddenly appeared and bravely pursued the enemy aircraft. The two sides fought fiercely for an hour. The government forces were victorious again. Two rebel aircraft were shot down, and the rest escaped. The people, seeing the government air force's combat skills so miraculous, were all exhilarated and greatly inspired. (Havas, 13th)</p>

<p>Madrid. Prime Minister Caballero has arrived here from Valencia and will go to the central front lines to inspect the positions and confer with the government military staff on the war situation. The militias at all places the Prime Minister visited cheered and saluted him. General Miaja, Chairman of the National Defense Committee, recently gave a radio broadcast speech to the front-line troops, stating that the Madrid defenders will never surrender. When the rebels come to attack, they will be resisted at any cost. The government forces will also launch a large-scale counterattack in the near future. The National Defense Committee also issued a war report, stating that the government forces had launched an offensive in the vicinity of the city today. On the right flank, the rebels were driven back and all destinations were occupied. It was also stated that there were several air battles over Madrid this afternoon.

Spanish Foreign Minister Vayo, recently returned here from Valencia, spoke with the Spanish Ambassador by long-distance telephone today and confirmed reports that the government has ordered a large-scale counterattack against the Nationalist forces. Prime Minister Caballero has also returned to the capital and today inspected the government forces' positions in the capital and consulted with various staff officers. The militias are now equipped with field artillery and other modern weapons manufactured abroad. The Nationalist cruiser Admiral Cervera is currently shuttling back and forth across the Strait of Gibraltar, each time carrying Moorish troops and hundreds of boxes of ammunition. The ammunition is then transported by train to Ronda and then by trucks to the Madrid front. In the last six days, a total of 10,000 troops have arrived in Spain from Ceuta, Morocco. According to a senior Nationalist officer, Nationalist Commander-in-Chief General Franco still needs 20,000 fresh troops before he can enter Madrid. (Reuters, 13th)</p>

This agency's accompanying military reporter reports that the Nationalist forces launched an attack in the southern suburbs of Madrid yesterday afternoon, assisted by tanks, aircraft, and artillery. The government artillery, although it returned fire, was ultimately unable to withstand the attack. They immediately lost the villages of Iezitro Herumtequi and Antonio Vorobezh Street. This place is south of the Toledobridge outside the south gate, about three hundred meters from the left bank of the Manzanares River. (Havas, 14th)</p>

<p>Madrid – The morale of the militia has greatly improved recently. For about a week, they have been quite successful in resisting the Moorish and foreign troops, realizing that these enemies are not invincible. The steady arrival of new war materials from abroad is also a reason for boosting the morale of the defending forces. The garrison troops are now mostly equipped with Italian-made rifles. It's ironic that weapons manufactured by the Fascists are being used to kill Fascists. Madrid's strategic position is quite unique. The Nationalists' main attack comes from the Toledo-Andalusia road, which is difficult to traverse. The many houses, embankments, airfields, and camps along the way can all be used as small fortresses, resulting in much street fighting since the beginning of the war. This is why Nationalist planes frequently attack this area. An offensive from the Casa de Campo area would be easier because the dense forests provide cover, but it would require crossing a vast plain, which is dominated by government machine guns.

<p>Madrid – An Englishwoman who has been living in the capital since the outbreak of the civil war described life in the besieged city to a Reuters correspondent today. She said that shopping is extremely difficult. This morning, a mile-long queue had formed outside a fish shop. Laundry is also a problem, because after washing, there is insufficient electricity to iron the clothes, so they remain damp and uncomfortable to wear. Gas supply has long been cut off. Fashionable clothing is a thing of the past, as women who dress fashionably are seen as middle class and are easily insulted. She has removed the fur collar from her coat. Traveling is dangerous because of frequent air raids. Many women are killed by bombs while gathering to shop. The woman also said that she is accustomed to air raids. Whenever she hears the sound of bombs exploding, she lies flat on the ground, as this is the only way to protect herself, because there are very few public shelters. After each air raid, the scene on the streets is unbearable to witness, as residents rushing home find their houses destroyed and their loved ones injured or killed, leading to inconsolable wailing.

<p>Budapest, Hungary – Responsible officials here commented on the above communiqué from the Little Entente, stating that the Little Entente had previously proposed to Hungary that it be allowed to enjoy equal rights to armament, but on the condition that Hungary concludes a mutual assistance treaty with the Little Entente. The "security guarantees" mentioned in this communiqué from the Little Entente often refer to this mutual assistance treaty. On the Hungarian side, it is believed that Hungary cannot assume the obligations of mutual assistance to countries that still maintain territorial claims to this day. Therefore, the Hungarian side rejected this proposal from the Little Entente at that time. As for Hungary's request for equal rights to armament, it cannot be accompanied by any reservations whatsoever. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>(Rome) – Well-informed sources recently explained that the reason why the Foreign Ministers' Meeting of Italy, Austria, and Hungary supported Hungary's request for equal rights to armament was because Hungary has suffered unfair treatment since the European War, such as limited armament, which is just one aspect. Therefore, it is advocated that such injustices be rectified. This advocacy is not intended to be hostile to any other country. In short, once Hungary implements its rearmament, it will be done in a gradual manner, so that all neighboring countries can adjust their own armament based on Hungary's military strength.

The question of reorganizing the League of Nations Covenant... 4. Representative Gu's speech in the general discussion of the Assembly... 5. The process of our country being elected as a member of the Administrative Council and a judge of the Hague... 6. Conclusion...</p>
<p>The Sixth Committee etc. discussed various political issues, but few were related to our country, and because our representative Guo needed to liaise and contact representatives from various countries regarding the election of members of the Administrative Council and the re-election of the Hague Tribunal, Secretary Liu Kai sometimes attended the committee. When discussing the problem of international refugees, the committee, based on the proposal of the subcommittee, passed the dispatch of the Eastern Refugee Investigation Group, which our side also seconded.</p>
<p>3. Reorganization of the League of Nations Covenant</p>
<p>Question Since the Argentine government proposed the topic of reorganizing the covenant, a preliminary discussion was held at the League of Nations Assembly on July 1st this year, and a resolution was passed on the 4th, instructing the Administrative Council to notify the countries to express their opinions before the September Assembly. Now, more than 20 countries have responded in writing, and the remaining countries that have not responded in writing have all directly stated their opinions in this Assembly through their representatives. Some of them are inevitably idealistic and not allowed by the current international situation, such as New Zealand's proposal to create an international army to protect the covenant, or that member states each contribute a portion of their army to be commanded by the League of Nations. I remember that France once had this argument, which was often debated as being too idealistic. At the same time, even if it can be realized in the future, it is questionable whether the command rights belong purely to the League of Nations. Observing the current situation of the League of Nations, if this kind of ideal can be realized, the result may inevitably create a tool for the big countries to protect themselves, which is tantamount to plotting for a tiger. It will not only fail to protect the covenant, but also put the League of Nations in a more dangerous situation, and it will be easier to create a situation of manipulation. Some advocated strengthening the sanctions measures of Article 16 of the covenant, that all geographically adjacent countries conclude military mutual assistance obligations. The so-called regional mutual assistance covenant. However, whether the conclusion of this kind of covenant should be subject to the League of Nations stipulating mandatory conclusion methods, or whether the relevant countries have the right to reserve or freely conclude, has not been seen in concrete proposals. The opinions of major countries who advocate the conclusion of this kind of covenant are largely the same. However, if this kind of covenant is not subject to the League of Nations stipulating mandatory conclusion methods, whether strong countries are willing to conclude with weak countries, or whether there is a possibility of conclusion, it will inevitably cause difficult problems. Some advocated modifying the method of unanimous voting in the Administrative Council, that when peace is threatened, the sanctions measures of the covenant do not need to be implemented through "unanimous voting" of the Administrative Council, so as to prevent aggressors from evading the law by taking advantage of their one vote. Therefore, when a situation under Article 11, Section 1 of the covenant occurs, the Administrative Council can execute it after passing a two-thirds majority vote. This view is largely the same in Russia, France, and the United Kingdom. In addition, some advocate maintaining the current status of the covenant without making any changes, but advocating that the military reduction methods stipulated in the covenant should be earnestly implemented, especially focusing on strong countries should reduce their military to achieve balance. Nordic countries such as Sweden, Norway, and Denmark can be representatives of this kind of opinion. Still others advocate determining the relationship between Article 10 and Article 16 of the covenant, so as to implement the League of Nations Covenant, the Paris Convention, and various covenants against armed usurpation concluded by South American countries. This argument is from Argentina, and the United Kingdom's opinion, in addition to the points mentioned above that are the same as Russia and France, also believes that the covenant should be separated from various peace treaties, and the circumstances of Article 19 of the covenant should be modified. As for the opinions of our government, they have been delivered to the League of Nations when the Assembly opened. Domestic newspapers have already published them, so I will not repeat them here. The League of Nations Assembly has decided to hold a meeting by the General Committee to discuss it. The date of the meeting of the committee has been set for December 7th of this year. We very much hope that the representatives of all countries will show a sincere spirit of cooperation at that time, so as to bring the arguments closer and move towards rationalization and practicalization, so as not to make the reorganization fail, drawing a tiger but resembling a dog, and instead easily creating the division situation before the European War.</p>
<p>4. In the General Discussion of the Assembly</p>
<p>My representative's speech At the general discussion of the Assembly, representatives of various countries, as usual, took the stage to express their opinions in the order of registration. My representative Gu had important analyses and criticisms of the serious situation in the Far East, the remote causes and recent consequences of the dangerous situation in Europe, our government's opinions in the League of Nations Covenant reorganization movement, the world disarmament issue, and economic conditions. Because the reporter feels the importance of the situation, I feel that the opinions expressed by my representative at the League of Nations Assembly should be paid attention to by the people of the country, so I will translate the entire draft as follows.</p>
<p>At the 17th Assembly, in a situation that was less energetic than in previous years, I am well aware that most of you feel uneasy about the volatile situation in Europe, and your thoughts have been disturbed by the responsibility of the important issues in this kind of practical situation. Therefore, I would like to raise some different questions about the situation in my country and the Far East in general, and say a few words, because I deeply believe that today's world has a particularly close relationship, and the problems that occur in one region are bound to be repeated in other parts. From the relationship between Asia and Europe, this is especially obvious. The repercussions of the serious events in the Far East from 1904 to 1905 in Europe and the fire in Europe from 1914 to 1918 reflected in Asia can be used as two powerful illustrations in the history of an era. What is the current situation in East Asia? I would like to briefly present two facts. The first is the amazing progress in the political and economic construction of my country in the past year. Recently, the relationship between the central government and the two southwestern provinces has been peacefully resolved, and the national political unification has been completed. The greatest successes have been achieved in public health, water conservancy work, cooperative enterprises, agricultural technology and industrial improvement, electrical transportation, motor railways, air transport, etc. The report of the commissioner of the Executive Yuan's committee has detailed descriptions of this kind of progress, and the Secretary-General's report has already cited it. The technical cooperation between my country and the League of Nations will continue to achieve satisfactory results, especially the recently established method with the League of Nations, which enables our country's experts to obtain knowledge and experience on the latest technological developments in the West, and there will be further success in cooperation. In this kind of relationship, we deeply appreciate the work of Mr. Haas. In terms of my country's currency system and foreign exchange, it has also achieved remarkable results. Since the change in foreign silver prices, my country's government has suffered for two years, but the system promulgated on November 3, 1935, has been implemented throughout the country. The results produced by this new economic policy have consolidated the currency system and stabilized exchange rates, which has been the most effective encouragement for exports. The unbalanced trade has therefore been sharply reduced. British economic expert Sir Frederick Leith-Ross has said that the steps taken have been fully proven in the results obtained. In short, my country's internal construction work has made amazing progress, even under particularly difficult circumstances. According to the observations of the American Far East Economic Survey Group, "China has shown extremely important changes. Its reform atmosphere compared with ten years ago or even five years ago is enough to break the records of centuries." In addition, I would like to say a few words about other issues in the Far East. The situation there has not only not been resolved, but preparations for war are intensifying. The constant activities of troops on the border have caused many incidents, and the armed aggression is expanding day by day, forming an extremely uneasy phenomenon, which will inevitably have a dangerous eruption, which is enough to have serious repercussions in Europe.</p>
<p>Speaking of the current situation in Europe, we do not feel that we can reduce our worries, especially the expansion of armaments. We are now fully fledged. I think that whether it is a large country or a small country, everyone is particularly aware that if we do not continue to maintain peace, we may be eliminated by strong powers before we are prepared. At the same time, countries are also actively working to strengthen national defense and conclude numerous regional military alliances. It seems that no country feels guaranteed at the moment. Peace is still far from being solid, which is no different from the past stage. Speaking of economic issues, as mentioned in the Secretary-General's report, it seems that many countries have evidence of revival. But whether we can be sure of the arrival of revival has become a question. From the perspective of pursuing policies that satisfy national selfish desires by using deceptive economic methods, the dubious nature of the road to economic revival is very obvious. Economic nationalism has not abandoned its illusion in countries around the world. Various commercial obstacles continue to shackle trade and hinder its development. To go further, the credibility of various treaties has been fundamentally shaken in recent years, and the dignity of various international obligations has been damaged. The meaning of the allied peaceful system and security guarantees has not been implemented as usual. Although it has been implemented recently, it has not produced the desired effect because it has been implemented slowly and is not adequate to the basic purpose of law and justice. There have been too many times of succumbing to the idea of convenience. The interests of collective peace have also been lost in the end. The history of the past few years has indicated to us that the result of adopting a compromise purpose for a temporary compulsion has often made the international order more chaotic, because the more serious and uneasy the situation, the more difficult it is to implement legal handling. Four years ago, those who mourned the meaning of the entire alliance and failed in the Far East incident may also have been aware that a similar situation is bound to occur in the West today. That kind of consciousness has been truly realized. Some may ask, in this situation, how should we ease this major problem? I am afraid that I may not be able to give you a very complete answer. I want to say a few words, but because my country feels that the current instability in the West has directly affected the Far East, I sincerely hope that this instability will be resolved as soon as possible. The Chinese delegation shares the same views as other delegations and believes that the main task of resolving the current crisis lies in trusting the League of Nations and maintaining the alliance, because this agency is the only organization in the world that maintains peace, and it can also be said to be a tool for dealing with international disputes and resolving conflicts. I have repeatedly said that the failure of the League of Nations in several major incidents in the past was not an error in the improper provisions of the covenant, but an error in the policies and methods used. The main purpose of the Assembly resolution on July 4th this year is also the same.</p>
<p>My government has made several recommendations in its reply to the Executive Yuan's memorandum. The recommendations have been detailed in the Secretary-General's awareness and have been distributed to you. It does not seem necessary to describe its contents in detail. In short, the purpose of this recommendation is entirely to promote the League of Nations' work to eliminate war and aggression, to eliminate war and aggression before they occur, and to contain them after they have occurred. Therefore, the League of Nations should still be given the power to deal with and implement the various methods stipulated in Article 16 of the League of Nations, so that it is in accordance with the provisions of Articles 10 and 11 of the League of Nations. If it is desired to quickly stop the half of the aggressor, the League of Nations should formulate a definition of aggression in the matter, and should formulate a rapid and effective plan in advance in order to implement the various methods of Article 16 of the League of Nations. In other words, the speed of action is the main condition for effectiveness, and preparing for a rainy day is the main condition for coping with the crisis. In order to achieve this goal, my government further suggests that the Assembly should vote on the definition of aggressors in the shortest possible time, and a standing committee of experts should be attached to the Secretariat to formulate the details of the implementation of the various methods of Article 16 of the League of Nations, so as to promote its realization when the Assembly decides to implement Article 16. As for the provision in Article 16, Section 2 that each member state should dispatch troops, my government also believes that it is very important, because this is the most important attachment to other ways of preventing aggression stipulated in that article. Only if it can be implemented at the same time can it become a perfect system for preventing aggression and war. Otherwise, the so-called sanctions can never have a rapid effect. Therefore, my government believes that this provision is worthy of research, and the competent authorities of the League of Nations should conduct research and pre-determine various implementation methods so that the League of Nations has something to rely on when world peace is threatened. At the same time, regional mutual assistance covenants should be added to conform to the spirit of the League of Nations. Another recommendation of my government lies in lifting the "unanimous voting" provision stipulated in Article 11, so as to obtain a resolution in the shortest possible time, so as to avoid the disputed matters from tending to military aggression due to delay, and then war occurs. The above points are just the big ones, not the entire recommendations. My delegation still advocates supplementing the entire recommendations when concrete discussions are held in the future. The reason why I talked about these points is just to express the sincerity of my government in supporting the League of Nations, and I am willing to express a sincere cooperation to this only agency that maintains peace, so as to promote the purpose of coexistence. At the same time, my government believes that Asian member states should occupy a seat as a director in the Administrative Council, so that my country can contribute cooperation to the Administrative Council as much as possible. On this point, I am very grateful to the Administrative Council for the warm attitude it has shown towards our proposals. The Administrative Council Reorganization Committee, which was organized last September, has considered the organization of the Administrative Council. This undertaking has been unanimously passed, and the First Committee of this Assembly has also unanimously passed it.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Huang Guotai's Gang Rampages in Zhangzhou and Xiamen, Looting on Land and Water, Allegedly with Background Support from a Certain Party <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: Huang Guotai, Huang He Shu, Hong Datou, Jiang Tianci, and other bandits from Longxi and Haicheng counties in Zhangzhou Prefecture, with Huang Guotai as their leader, have regrouped with over a hundred bandits, looting in various places in the southern countryside of Zhangzhou. They have issued "black lists" in more than ten villages and towns, including Shuitou, Hongcuoqian, Xiagong, Danzhou, Mazhou, Lindun, and Hongban, demanding amounts ranging from several thousand to tens of thousands of yuan. The villagers, facing economic ruin, were unable to pay. On the 7th, the Huang bandits angrily stormed into Lindun to loot. On the evening of the 8th, they attacked Hongtang, kidnapping more than thirty villagers, releasing over twenty of the poorest, and binding the eleven they considered wealthy. They also shot and killed three people on the spot. That night, they attacked Xiayangshe, burning down two houses. On the 9th, they attacked Tianbian, killing two villagers. They are now gathered in Dongdai. The "black lists" they issue are signed by Huang Houjian (another name for Guotai), the Commander of the Fujian Independent Brigade of the Chinese People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army. The garrison is dispatching troops to encircle and suppress them. According to reports, Huang Guotai was a former subordinate of Wu Ci. After Wu's involvement in the Fujian Incident, he once raised the false banner of the "South China State" in Hua'an. Later, he surrendered and was incorporated into the government forces. Last winter, Wu was assassinated, and Huang became a bandit again, gathering Huang Hedong, Hong Datou, Jiang Tianci, Zheng Beizai, and others, becoming their leader. Zheng was killed by government troops this past September, and Huang took over his followers. Although each group has only twenty or thirty people, totaling just over a hundred, the depth of their harm to the people surpasses all other major bandit gangs in Zhangzhou. Their accomplices are spread throughout Longxi, Haicheng, and the cities of Zhangzhou, Shima, Damen, and Gulangyu. On land, they issue "black lists" in various villages of Longxi and Haicheng counties; on water, they collect flag fees. The so-called "black lists" are written notices demanding the payment of certain amounts of money by a deadline, threatening murder or kidnapping for non-compliance. "Flag fees" are collected from all Zhangzhou-owned ships, whether cargo or fishing boats, on the sea and rivers of Zhangzhou, requiring a monthly payment in exchange for a small flag, which serves as a guarantee of safe passage. Otherwise, they face murder and ship robbery if they encounter bandits on the way. Countless people on land and water have died because of this. Due to their widespread accomplices and extensive connections, they can rampage in the areas of Xicheng Zhangma in Zhangzhou with a small force. Repeated military suppression has failed to capture them, and local militia are also unable to curb their activities. What distinguishes them from other bandit gangs is their collusion with a certain party and their alleged background support. On the 10th of this month, the Second Brigade of the Damen Marine Police, while in Douzaiwei Coast of Beishi, Xiamen, captured Chen Jintang, a bandit who collected "flag fees" from boat owners. They found oil-printed notification slips for collecting fees, which stated, "Our headquarters is reorganizing the sea surface this time, entirely for protection purposes. We appreciate the generous assistance of all boat owners. In the future, when our headquarters achieves its goals, all favors will be repaid. The monthly fees must be paid in full between the 1st and 5th of each month. Violators will be severely punished." The slip was signed by Huang Xiongjian (of the Headquarters), Chief Manager Kang Jianying, and Deputy Manager Gan Jianwu. According to Chen's confession, "The Damen office is located behind the Wantong Opium Den on Jukou Street. The leaders are Kang and Gan. Each ship pays a 'stove fee' of ten yuan and a monthly fee of three yuan. The office has been established for over two months, and Damen can collect over three thousand yuan each month. The boat owners come to pay voluntarily. Those who do not pay are urged. The fee is split between Wantong and us. There is a door in the back of Wantong that leads to the Butterfly Dance Hall," etc. According to reports, the Wantong Opium Den, known as "Wantong Foreign Firm," is operated by Taiwanese people of Japanese nationality, and the Butterfly Dance Hall is also operated by Taiwanese people. Based on the confession, the marine police, together with the Public Security Bureau and officials from the Japanese Consulate, went to Wantong on Jukou Street to arrest them. Upon arrival, Kang, Gan, and their subordinates were already aware and immediately broke down the door and fled, firing shots along the way. The police failed to capture them and returned without conducting a search of the office. At that time, one bandit fled into a nearby house, leaving behind his hat and clothes, and escaped by climbing over the roof. Afterward, the homeowner took the clothes to the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau. At night, someone actually went to the Jukou Street area to inquire, saying that someone had left clothes at a certain house in the afternoon and they had come to retrieve them, but they could not remember which house or the address. None of the nearby residents dared to tell them where it was. After inquiring for a long time without success, they left. They were extremely bold. Huang Guotai joined Weng Cixing's pseudo-Datong League and the Heng Society organized by Weng this summer. After Weng surrendered, Huang remained a bandit. Therefore, he still uses the banner of the so-called "Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army" and imitates the organization of the Heng Society to form a secret society, forcing people on land and water to join and using the character "sword" as a symbol. All those who join his gang must have the character "sword" in their names, such as Huang, who changed his name to "Houjian," and Kang Jianying and Gan Jianwu. The "flag" given to ships at sea as protection is a small yellow flag with a sword drawn on it. The more than three thousand yuan in flag fees collected by the Damen office is used to support the bandits' families in Xiamen and Gulangyu and to purchase guns and ammunition. Kang and Gan are the chief and deputy directors of his Damen branch. Damen, Beishi, Douzaiwei, Nanshi, Xiagang, and the anchorages for sailing ships in Gulangyu are all within his sphere of influence. Those who are late in paying "flag fees" are hung up and beaten. One old boatman was forced to pay fifty-seven yuan for ten months of flag fees and "stove fees" at once, having already paid thirty yuan in installments and still owing twenty-seven yuan. In addition, Haimen, Baishuiying, Shima, and Zhangzhou all have branch offices, while the pseudo-headquarters is located in Chendi, under the jurisdiction of Haicheng. Huang Guotai himself is mostly in Chendi, but also often comes to Damen, accompanied by several people carrying Mauser pistols as guards. It is obvious that he has background support from a certain party and that he can rampage in Xicheng Zhangma without defeat shows the breadth of his connections and the depth of his control over the general population.

<p>Gu Fuqi, a clerk in the parcel section of the local Postal Administration, committed suicide by electrocution at home on the morning of August 26th of this year. Beforehand, he wrote a suicide note and left it to the administrative officer. After the incident, the suicide note was seized by the county government. Because its contents involved the issue of private soil carried in postal packages, Xu Fuchang and postal workers Yang Dahui, Tong Jiayao, postal carriers Tian Changhai, Yu Afu, Yu Shousheng, Wu Jide, Cheng Xiangfu, Zhang Lianyuan, and others were all summoned to the county and escorted to the Second District Security Command for interrogation and detention. Three months have passed. The military court has now determined that Xu Fuchang and the other ten people are not related to this case and ordered their release on bail. Due to procedural delays, they must be released on bail on Monday. As for the reinstatement of postal workers Yang Dahui and postal carriers Tian Changhai and the other eight people, the matter must await the bureau chief's request to the Postal Administration for further review.</p>

<p>The Wujin Bank in Wuyi, opened a branch office in the third courtyard of Zhang Fuji Grain Store in Qishuyan Westkou starting on the 1st of this month, employing two clerks. The 12th was the anniversary of the general manager's birthday. The branch office clerks came to the city beforehand to participate in a Qixia Mountain tour. Unexpectedly, thieves broke into the office in the middle of the night on that day, pried open the bank's safe, and stole three thousand six hundred yuan in cash and silver dollars stored inside out of the eight thousand yuan inside the safe. It was not until dawn that it was discovered that the front and back doors of the room were not open, only the back door of Mujin was found to be wide open, with a bamboo pole leaning against the wall, suggesting it was used to climb over the wall. The incident was immediately reported to the Sixth Branch of the Public Security Bureau for investigation. It was quickly determined that the night watchman, Lao Si, was highly suspicious and was taken to the police station for questioning.</p>

<p>Since taking office, Tong Hangshi, President of the Fujian Provincial High Court, has spared no effort in rectifying the judiciary. Last year, he went to Southern and Northern Fujian to conduct inspections in person, improving all matters that needed improvement or reform based on the actual situation. Therefore, the people of Fujian have given him the reputation of "Iron-Faced Tong." The 18th of this month is his sixtieth birthday, and relatives and friends have launched an initiative to celebrate his birthday. However, Director Tong, citing the ongoing national crisis, declined, but old friends in Fujian, because Director Tong is known for his integrity, had Zhang Qin, a former compiler of the Hanlin Academy, write an article to celebrate his birthday. Director Tong, feeling unable to refuse, decided to leave the provincial capital to avoid the celebrations and inspect the judiciary in Eastern Fujian. The judiciary in Fujian was previously extremely dark, with deeply entrenched problems. After inspections and reforms in Southern and Northern Fujian, the situation has been renewed. The situation in Eastern Fujian is different. In order to conduct on-site investigations into the advantages and disadvantages, he is taking this opportunity to tour the area to facilitate the rectification.</p>

<p>Xiao Bingzhang, the newly appointed Supervisory Commissioner of the Sixth Administrative District of Jiangxi, has followed Premier Sun in revolution for many years. He was recently appointed by the authorities to preside over the district's administration. His administrative policy is to start with the development of the economy. According to Hu Weiwen, a senior official of the commissioner's office, the district's situation and administrative policies are as follows: (1) Providing loans to rural areas. The district is rich in products, such as Guangfeng County's tobacco, which was sold overseas in large quantities in the past. However, due to local turmoil, production has sharply declined. Other products, such as Hekou's paper and Yiyang's rice, are in the same situation. It is now planned to negotiate with the banking sector to provide loans for relief in order to increase and improve products. (2) Promoting cooperation. The products of each county are sold by merchants, resulting in heavy exploitation. Producers are the first to suffer, and merchants lack organization, leading to high transportation costs and losses. Now that the Zhegan Railway runs through the territory, it is planned to form large-scale transportation and sales cooperatives to facilitate sales. (3) Adjusting consumption. The district's customs are mostly simple, but unnecessary consumption is unavoidable. It is now planned to implement a thrifty movement in accordance with the principles of national economic construction, guiding consumption into the right track. Other major tasks, such as managing warehousing, promoting education, and training strong men, should also be implemented in accordance with government orders.</p>

<h3 id="e84">Local Business Community Prepares to Welcome the Nanyang Commercial Inspection Group <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>The Nanyang Commercial Inspection Group departed the country on July 16th, traveling through Manila, Surabaya, Semarang, Batavia, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh, Siam, Penang, Medan, and other places. They were warmly welcomed by overseas Chinese. In each location, they held exhibitions of domestic products, attracting crowds of men and women. Various foreign governments provided preferential treatment, treating them as foreign guests. The group negotiated with economic authorities in various countries and engaged in national diplomacy, receiving much praise from overseas Chinese. The group also gave public speeches in various locations, publicizing the current situation in China and the government's concern for overseas Chinese, which greatly enhanced the patriotic sentiments of overseas Chinese. As a result, there are already three or four groups that want to organize homeland inspection groups. The group has now returned to China on the French postal ship General Xiafei. The following is a summary of the situation:</p>
<p>Philippines: Upon the group's arrival in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, with the assistance of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, under the leadership of Chairman Li Qingquan, they held an exhibition of domestic products. Philippine President Quezon and Vice President Osmeña were very supportive. At the same time, the group negotiated with the China-Philippines National Association, striving to enhance the friendship between China and the Philippines. Therefore, the exhibition was as grand as a carnival. The Philippine market is almost entirely dominated by Japanese goods. Although American goods can be imported duty-free, they still cannot compete. The shipment of domestic goods to the Philippines has been decreasing year by year. The group has now reached a strong agreement with major Chinese importers in the area, under the principle of mutual assistance, to vigorously seek to expand the domestic goods market in the Philippines. The group will be able to realize this after returning to China.</p>
<p>Dutch East Indies: Including Surabaya, Semarang, Batavia, and Medan, four major ports. Except for Semarang, which was not included in the exhibition program due to special reasons, grand exhibitions of domestic products were held in the other three ports. After the group entered the country, they were formally received by the Dutch East Indies Ministry of Economy, so all proceedings were very convenient. However, due to import restrictions, the import of domestic goods faced extreme difficulties. Overseas Chinese in Java, Sumatra, and other places mainly operate as wholesalers, while importers are mostly in the hands of Europeans. Group leader Gao Shiheng negotiated with the Ministry of Economy, and the Dutch East Indies government issued a special import permit to show accommodation. However, the final promotion method still needs further effort.</p>
<p>British Malaya: In addition to holding a domestic exhibition in Singapore and Penang, the group visited Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh, and other places, and was greatly welcomed by overseas Chinese groups. Overseas Chinese celebrities such as Hu Wenhu, Chen Jiageng, and Liang Shannan all provided warm hospitality. Overseas Chinese in Malaya have a higher level of education compared to other parts of Nanyang and have a better understanding of domestic goods. Therefore, the domestic exhibition held at the Great World in Singapore every year has achieved good results. The group held the exhibition at the Daguan Garden Amusement Park in Penang. The admission ticket for the amusement park cost two jiao, but there were 6,000 visitors every day, which shows its popularity. The organizations of overseas Chinese groups in Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh, and other places are exceptionally sound. The addresses of the Chinese Chambers of Commerce are all tall and magnificent. Since 1935, the prices of rubber and tin in Malaya have increased, resulting in a significant recovery. If domestic goods are cheap and suitable, there is great hope.</p>
<p>Siam: Siam has 2.5 million overseas Chinese, and Chinese shops are everywhere. Currently, many senior officials in the Siamese government are of Chinese descent. After the group arrived in Siam, the welcome was no less grand than that of the previous Siamese inspection group. Siam is an agricultural country, so all industrial products rely on imports. In the past, Chinese people had very little understanding of the Siamese market. The group's inspection found that there was great hope and that there were many goods that could be shipped for sale but had not yet been sent to the market. Therefore, the number of people visiting the domestic exhibition every day was extremely crowded. During his stay in Siam, Group Leader Gao gathered various leaders to discuss the results. As a first step, they organized a domestic goods company. At that time, they raised a capital of 70,000 yuan and planned to realize it in the shortest possible time, so the future is very optimistic. The group has completed its work in Medan and departed from Medan on November 3 to return to China, making slight stops in Singapore, Saigon, and other places, and returning on the original ship (French postal ship General Xiafei). The local business community has prepared a warm welcome to the group, which has traveled thousands of miles to promote domestic goods, and there will be a grand occasion at that time.</p>

<p>Promoting the Establishment of Factory Inspection Offices in Shanghai: After the Shanghai Municipal Government received an order from the Ministry of Industry to expedite the establishment of a "Shanghai Municipal Factory Inspection Office," the Factory Inspection Office of the Third Section of the Bureau of Social Affairs drafted an organizational plan for the Shanghai Municipal Factory Inspection Office. It was approved at a recent bureau affairs meeting and submitted to the municipal government for forwarding to the Ministry of Industry for filing. Upon approval, the Shanghai Municipal Factory Inspection Office will be established under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Social Affairs. In order to promote the speedy establishment of a factory inspection office in Shanghai, the Central Factory Inspection Bureau sent Section Chief Wang Ying, who arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning. He immediately met with Xu Yefu, Section Chief of the Third Section of the Bureau of Social Affairs, to discuss the establishment of the factory inspection office.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Sun Weidong Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Morning, Discusses North China Smuggling Issues, Comes to Pay Respects on Behalf of Song, and to Meet with Kong to Discuss Chen <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Sun Weidong, Superintendent of the Tianjin Customs, was dispatched by Zhu Zheyuan, Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, to come south and pay respects to Duan Qirui. He arrived in Shanghai at 7:40 a.m. yesterday morning on the Pinghu through train. After resting briefly, he went to Duan's residence on Avenue Joffre at around 10:30 a.m. to pay his condolences. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency met with Sun at Duan's residence. According to Sun:</p>
<p>Purpose of the Trip: Sun replied to the reporter's question, saying that he had three missions for this trip to Shanghai: (1) To pay respects on behalf of Chairman Song and assist with the funeral arrangements, to liaise with the funeral committee, and to decide whether to build a cemetery in advance in accordance with Mr. Duan's wishes to be buried in the Western Hills of Beiping at a state funeral, or to wait until the coffin is moved to Beiping before determining the location, so that Beiping can make all the arrangements in advance. (2) To meet with Finance Minister Kong to report and request instructions on Tianjin Customs affairs. (3) To attend the funeral of Mr. Wu Shan, a close friend of Chairman Song, on behalf of Chairman Song. Chairman Song, because of Mr. Wu's efforts in national affairs during his lifetime and his desolate circumstances after his death, specially donated 2,000 yuan as a contribution, which was brought by me to Mr. Wu's family. As Mr. Wu's son is still young, it is planned to use half of the amount for funeral expenses and the other half for Mr. Wu's son's education expenses. I will need to stay in Shanghai for one or two weeks before returning north. Mr. Xiao Zhenying has decided to go abroad. Reports say that Chairman Song sent me 100,000 yuan last time for travel expenses, but this is not true. I did not come here last time.</p>
<p>Smuggling Issues: The issue of smuggling in North China is complex and difficult to resolve. Previously, Minister Kong sent Counselor Li (Qingxuan) to North Hebei and Chahar, and Secretary-General Ge (Dingyuan) of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council came south. The discussions were only on how to clear smuggled goods, and there was no way to stop the source. Therefore, the clearing of smuggled goods has not been able to proceed immediately. As for how many smuggled goods there are, it is difficult to count because they come and go at any time.</p>
<p>Security in Hebei and Chahar: As for the situation in North China, the security in Hebei and Chahar is very solid. The situation in Suiyuan is not as serious as the rumors suggest. Chairman Song's talk the other day can give a general overview. Reports say that there are 30,000 to 40,000 pseudo-bandit troops, which is an exaggeration. In reality, there are only over 10,000 people. They are being exploited and used by others to cause some disturbances as a way to repay them.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Central Mint Review Meeting <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>

The meeting was also attended by the secretary of the committee, Shi Yusheng, and the chemist Mr. Ryder. It was chaired by Kong Yongzhi (Chen Jianan attended in his place due to illness). The recorder for the meeting was Li Zhuchang. In addition to approving the minutes of the last meeting, the secretary reported that in October 1936, the committee supervised and stamped 89 strips of Class B (0.880 fineness) mint bars and supervised and sealed three types of subsidiary coins, totaling 8,070,000 twenty-fen nickel coins, 8,000,000 ten-fen nickel coins, and 32,540,000 one-fen copper coins. All were approved for publication and listed for announcement. Detailed reports were also given on the evaluation of mint affairs, review of mint accounts, chemical verification of miscellaneous strips entering the mint, and the committee's work in October. The regular meeting approved the reports. The meeting adjourned at 5:20 p.m.</p>

<p>Song Ziliang, Special Commissioner of Finance for Guangdong Province and concurrently Director of Finance, came to the capital this time to meet with President Chiang of the Executive Yuan and Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance, to report on the reorganization of Guangdong's finances and to request instructions on all matters. He originally intended to leave Shanghai and return to his post as soon as possible, but after arriving in Shanghai, his liver ailment flared up, so he stayed in Shanghai to seek treatment from Dr. Fan. More than a month has passed. As the financial matters he requested have yielded satisfactory results, and his liver ailment has also healed, he took the French postal ship "Losser" yesterday morning at 9 a.m. with Secretary Zhuang Yongling and others to return south to his post. At that time, Vice Minister Xu Kan of the Ministry of Finance, Vice President Chen Xing of the Central Bank, Manager Xi Demao of the Business Bureau, Manager Bei Songsun of the Bank of China, Deputy Commissioner Song Zi'an of the Songjiang Salt Transport, and important personnel from the China Construction Bank and the National Products Bank all went to see him off.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Wang Zhengting Talks About Sino-American Relations: China Welcomes Foreign Investment, Only Requires No Damage to Chinese Sovereignty <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>According to the Shenzhou News Agency, Wang Zhengting, the newly appointed ambassador to the United States, will depart for his post in the middle of next month. Yesterday, Wang met with foreign reporters at his residence to discuss Sino-American relations. Wang said that the friendship between China and the United States has existed for more than 200 years, and the relationship has always been extremely harmonious. He hopes that Sino-American relations can continue to improve in the future. Under the principle of not harming Chinese sovereignty, the United States can help China develop its resources as much as possible. China's current lack of capital is similar to the situation in the United States 150 years ago. Later, with the help of European countries, especially the United Kingdom, the United States developed its abundant resources and became prosperous. Therefore, during the European war, the United States was able to help the United Kingdom's recovery with its surplus. This situation has many lessons for China. China's capital supply is naturally limited during this period of national crisis, but the development of natural resources is unlimited. Therefore, China now welcomes unlimited investment of foreign capital. China is an ancient country with a long history, but its industry is still in its infancy. If it receives assistance from friendly countries, the prospect of China's development is very promising. The reporter then asked about the issue of the United States abolishing consular jurisdiction in China. Wang said that this is still a pending case. China not only has this hope for the United States, but will also use appropriate methods in the same spirit to seek the same solution from all countries. Wang finally said that the situation in the Far East is indeed in a dangerous state, but it is not as severe as in 1913 or 1932. He hopes that this serious situation can be resolved as soon as possible. It is also learned that Mr. Wang plans to meet with former U.S. Secretary of State Stimson next month after arriving in the United States.</p>

<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, it has recently been rumored that Japan and the Netherlands have established a sugar agreement to dump sugar in our country and compete for the market. The sugar industry in this city is quite panicked. Liang Hejun, chairman of the Sugar Transportation and Sales Management Committee of the Ministry of Finance, came to Shanghai in person to inquire about the truth after hearing the news. Mr. Liang visited the person in charge of the Dutch sugar industry organization in Shanghai. According to their answer, the rumor is not true and they denied it. The Japanese government also stated that it had not taken such measures. Mr. Liang reported the situation to the National Sugar Production and Sales Association. The association originally planned to convene a meeting of directors to discuss countermeasures. Because the situation was clear, there was no need for discussion, so the meeting was cancelled. It is now learned that Mr. Liang has completed his work in Shanghai and returned to Beijing by train the night before last to report to the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Government Agencies Use Domestic Products: Five Supplementary Suggestions Sent by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and Municipal Local Association to the Executive Yuan and Relevant Ministries Requesting Adoption <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai Municipal Local Association believe that the seven articles of the "Provisional Measures for Government Agencies to Purchase Domestic Products" passed by the Executive Yuan this time are a profound encouragement to domestic industry. Based on their considerations, they listed five suggestions and sent them to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Industry, requesting adoption. The original text is recorded as follows: "To the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Industry in Nanjing: The seven articles of the 'Provisional Measures for Government Agencies to Purchase Domestic Products' passed by the Executive Yuan, reflect the central government's determination to promote domestic products, which has advanced from encouragement and advocacy to active promotion. The encouragement to domestic industry is profound and far-reaching. The article stating that any government agency that does not use domestic products when available will be considered an uneconomical expenditure and will not be approved for reimbursement is particularly encouraging and should be heeded throughout the country. After unanimously endorsing this, our association wishes to extend it to all industrial and commercial organizations nationwide for uniform implementation, in order to promote it universally. However, considering what concerns us, we respectfully submit our humble opinions: (1) Creating a catalog of domestic products and distributing it to various agencies for selection is an excellent method. However, before creating the catalog, it seems that specialists should be appointed to conduct a thorough review to ensure appropriateness. (2) Before approving the registration and issuing a certificate of domestic origin to domestic factories that have not been registered, in order to prevent non-domestic products from being falsely represented, it is necessary to consult widely and thoroughly to confirm that they are truly domestic products before issuing the certificate and creating the catalog, prioritizing quality over quantity. (3) For merchants who sell non-domestic products as domestic products, there are already measures in place for punishment. The fundamental solution is to hope that the unified domestic products company planned by the Executive Yuan will be realized as soon as possible, so that domestic products companies can be established in various regions in order for government agencies to purchase them. (4) For necessary items that are essential for daily life and have a significant impact on the national economy, it is hoped that the Executive Yuan and relevant ministries will work with the industrial sector to find ways to provide assistance and prepare for self-production. (5) Due to the full support and promotion of the Executive Yuan and relevant ministries, all products of domestic factories will inevitably have smooth sales. In the event that this leads to price increases, which would affect purchasers, it would betray the original intention of the Executive Yuan and relevant ministries. We request that a notice be issued in advance to warn against this in order to facilitate implementation. The above five points are merely humble opinions, and we trust that the Executive Yuan and relevant ministries will carefully consider them. We deeply admire and are eager to see the benefits. We respectfully submit this appeal and hope for your consideration. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and Shanghai Municipal Local Association, respectfully, sealed."</p>

<p>The China International Famine Relief Commission at 97 Renji Road has repeatedly received reports from Sichuan that the drought is extremely severe. Details are as follows: The Hechuan County Government of Sichuan Province stated in a letter: "This year, our county has been hit by a series of disasters, including wind, hail, and earthquakes, which have devastated agricultural production. Since the beginning of summer, the river god has wreaked havoc, causing significant losses to residents along the river in three or four incidents. Most severely, the drought has been devastating. Since summer, the rice and sorghum have mostly withered and died, and even the potato has no chance of survival. As winter approaches, the fields are all red. It is difficult for villagers to find water to drink, and there is no way to plant the winter grain. There is no harvest in either paddy fields or dry fields. Distressed people gather and rob grain, creating dangerous situations. The future is long and unimaginable. We earnestly request generous assistance to help the disaster victims." The Liangshan County Government stated in a letter: "Between spring and summer this year, our county had timely rain and sunshine, and the fields were all sown. However, since mid-summer, the scorching sun has been raging, and it has not rained for a long time. The seedlings have all withered, and there is no hope for beans and sorghum. Farmers in various villages, supporting the old and carrying the young, carrying withered rice and sorghum, are calling for help along the way, displaced and scattered, which is a tragic sight. We request allocation of funds for relief. Your kindness will be deeply appreciated." The Relief Branch of Qu County stated in a letter: "Our county has been unfortunate in recent years, with disasters occurring repeatedly. This summer, there was another severe drought, and as far as the eye can see, the land is red and there is no harvest. The bark and roots of trees have been dug up almost entirely, and even parents and wives cannot protect each other. Abandonment and displacement are everywhere, and the situation is tragic and unbearable. What crime have the people of Qu County committed to suffer such a calamity? Merciful heavens, when will it end? We ask your commission to advocate and raise funds to save these disaster victims. Your merit will be immeasurable."</p>

<p>Since the expansion of the anti-drug campaign began in this city on the 10th of this month, the Municipal Police Bureau immediately ordered all officers and police in each branch to organize propaganda teams and conduct propaganda in various districts. All investigators of the bureau were also ordered to go out to supervise the propaganda, paying special attention to factories and shantytowns, and persuading drug addicts to voluntarily quit as soon as possible. At the same time, the bureau is currently exchanging third-term limited-period opium smoking licenses. Many smokers are hesitant to exchange their licenses, and the deadline for exchanging licenses is the 30th of this month. The time is very short. Therefore, the bureau is taking advantage of this propaganda period to simultaneously conduct door-to-door inspections and persuade smokers to exchange their licenses. In recent days, the bureau's work has been very intense. Dai Lizhen, the head of the anti-drug department, went to the Xinzha Road Branch, Hengfeng Road, Mongolia Road, Pusong, and Xujiahui police stations in the previous two days to convene all working police officers to give instructions, encouraging them to redouble their efforts in order to achieve the greatest effect. Recently, due to the enthusiastic participation of drug addicts in quitting, the number of beds is insufficient. Yesterday morning (the 14th), Dai also went to the Shanghai North Drug Rehabilitation Hospital to discuss with the hospital director, Mei Zhuosheng, about finding ways to increase the number of beds to meet the demand. Dai also pointed out that in recent investigations, the number of repeat offenders who relapsed after quitting drugs was very large. He then convened the drug addicts in the hospital and gave a speech urging them to completely repent after quitting and not relapse again, so as not to be caught in the criminal net. The listeners were all moved.</p>

<h3 id="e101">Shanghai Tramways Company: All Conductors Indignant Because Zhu Huiren Was Dismissed Innocently; Request for Reinstatement Unsuccessful After Petition <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, more than 450 conductors of the Shanghai Tramways Company are indignant because conductor No. 330, Zhu Huiren, was falsely accused by inspector No. 127, who fabricated facts and reported them to the company. The company authorities did not investigate the truth and unreasonably dismissed him, causing him to lose his livelihood and attempt suicide by drowning in the river. Fortunately, he was rescued. All the conductors were dissatisfied after hearing this and jointly petitioned the company's general manager, Irvine, requesting relief. Yesterday, they sent representatives to request it, but were also rejected, causing indignation among all the conductors. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Petition for Reinstatement</p>
<p>Zhu Huiren, conductor No. 330 of the Shanghai Tramways Company, has been working for the company for more than ten years. At 9:30 p.m. on the 3rd of this month, he was working on the No. 8 tram. When the tram arrived at the gate of the Tongxing Cotton Mill in Yangshupu, seven mechanics boarded the tram. Because one of them accidentally injured his finger on the iron gate, the conductor comforted him, which prevented him from selling tickets. When a Chinese ticket inspector, No. 127, boarded the tram to check tickets, he believed that the conductor was suspected of skimming money and reported it to the company. However, the company did not investigate the truth and immediately dismissed him, causing him to be unjustly accused and have no means of living. He attempted suicide by drowning in the Suzhou River and was fortunately rescued by the water patrol team. All the conductors of the company heard the news and jointly submitted a petition to the company, requesting that the dismissal order be revoked, but it was not approved. Yesterday morning at 10 a.m., they sent four representatives to the traffic superintendent, Pollock, requesting permission to be reinstated in order to maintain their livelihood, but were also rejected. All the conductors were panicked after hearing the news and decided to ask the company for reinstatement again. If they do not achieve their goal, they will take effective action to help him.</p>
<p>Letter to the Company</p>
<p>The conductors of the company jointly submitted a letter to Irvine, the general manager of the Shanghai Tramways Company, stating that inspector No. 127 fabricated facts and made false accusations, causing conductor No. 330 to suffer an unjust wrong. They requested a detailed investigation, revocation of the order, and reconsideration in order to redress the grievance and appease public anger. Conductor No. 230 has been serving the company for 16 years, has been diligent in his work, and has spent his youthful energy in these 16 years. Now, because of a trivial matter, without careful investigation and listening to one side of the story, his job was suddenly terminated, causing his family to have nothing to rely on, and he is bound to face the tragedy of his mother dying, his wife leaving, his children scattering, and suicide. How violent is the company's approach to dealing with workers? According to No. 330, at about 9:30 p.m. on the 3rd, seven mechanics came to the tram at the Tongxing Mill stop in Yangshupu. One of them injured his finger on the iron gate, causing an argument with the conductor, which hindered ticket sales. In the short time of one minute, the tram arrived at the Yitai Mill, and there were still four 18-cent tickets that had not been sold. Inspector No. 127 boarded the tram with seven or eight passengers. No. 330 immediately stated to No. 1117 that these seven people had come from the Tongxing small station, and the argument with one passenger had hindered work. Unexpectedly, No. 127 used his position to take revenge and fabricated that ten passengers had not had tickets sold to them. In theory, for all tickets that have not been sold, it is most important to first investigate whether it is possible to skim money. If the tickets are 6, 8, or 10 cents, the inspector should pull them from the conductor and make a report with evidence. If the tickets are 14, 16, or 18 cents, the conductor cannot skim money. The four passengers mentioned above were going to Yangjinghong with 18-cent tickets. Not only could they not skim money at the Yitai Mill, but they also could not skim money at Sanxin or Yangshupu Bridge. Only a person with a mental illness would skim money on an 18-cent ticket. Moreover, No. 330 is an old conductor, how could he dare to take this risk? With a little thought, it can be concluded that the report of No. 127 is untrue. As for No. 127's intentional false accusation of No. 330, the following situation exists: Inspector No. 127 specializes in asking conductors for money. No. 330 has paid bribes many times, even once in February this year, as the diary can prove. According to company rules, if a conductor gives money to a ticket inspector, the conductor may also be dismissed. Therefore, the ticket inspector repeatedly asked the conductor for money, and the conductor dared not report it and could not refuse, because once he refused, he would be in danger of being falsely accused. No. 330 was unjustly accused because he refused. If this matter is not investigated and a fair judgment is not made, listening to a blank document is tantamount to the company authorities creating opportunities for ticket inspectors to ask for money. If the ticket inspector's wishes are not fulfilled, everyone is in danger of being falsely accused and losing their jobs. We are all uneasy and restless. Therefore, we request the company authorities to restore No. 330's work and cancel the unproven report in order to redress the grievance and fulfill the expectations of the public. We are waiting for orders with utmost urgency. Respectfully submitted.</p>

<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, workers at the Sixth Factory of Naigaiwata Cotton Mill in the Shanghai West District resumed work last night. The remaining factories are consulting directly with the labor side to prevent labor unrest, which is not expected to spread. Factories in the Shanghai East District have all resumed work. Funatsu, chairman of the Japanese Cotton Spinning Association, thanked the municipal government for its assistance in quelling the labor unrest. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Sixth Factory Resumed Work Last Night</p>
<p>The overall strike at the Sixth Factory of Naigaiwata Cotton Mill in the West Suzhou Road was caused by a local dispute in which a Japanese foreman beat a female worker in the fine yarn room. It has been going on for two days. The factory's foreman, Nakano Kajiro, spoke with the foremen and supervisors of each class and department yesterday afternoon at 2 p.m. As a result, it was decided that wages would be increased after the factories decided on a method, and the dispute over the beating of the female worker would be dealt with after the facts were clarified. Therefore, all workers have resumed work in the night shift yesterday.</p>
<p>Direct Negotiations in Various Factories</p>
<p>After the workers of more than ten factories in the Shanghai West District, including the Japanese Naigaiwata Cotton Mill, Kiwa, Toyota, Nichihua, and Tongxing First Factory, jointly proposed various conditions such as increased wages, bonuses, and rest, the factories are now trying to avoid the occurrence of similar labor unrest, because they have learned that the factories in the Shanghai East District suffered losses after the strike. In addition to advising all workers to wait patiently for a solution, they are also consulting directly with the foremen and worker representatives, and are increasing wages by 5% according to the methods of the Shanghai and other factories. Based on the current situation, the labor unrest in the factories in the Shanghai West District is not expected to spread.</p>
<p>Inspections of Factories in Shanghai East District</p>
<p>Since the party and government agencies sent personnel to mediate the labor unrest in the Shanghai First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Factories, Tongxing First Factory, Dakang, Donghua, Gongda Second Factory, and other factories in the Shanghai East District, they reluctantly returned to work on the 3rd. The reporter of the Dagong News Agency drove to the factories yesterday morning to inspect the situation. The number of workers returning to work has increased compared to the previous day, and the atmosphere has eased. All the detectives stationed in each factory by the police have also been withdrawn.</p>
<p>Japanese Side Thanks the Municipal Government</p>
<p>After the labor unrest occurred in the Japanese cotton mills in Shanghai and other places, the municipal government authorities advised the workers to resume work and wait patiently for a solution. They also sent personnel to visit Funatsu, chairman of the Japanese Cotton Spinning Association in China, to negotiate the five demands put forward by the labor side. Now that the problem of resuming work has been resolved, Funatsu Tatsuiro, chairman of the association, sent a telegram to Wang Xianqing, director of the Mediation Section of the Third Department of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, expressing his gratitude to our government for its mediation and resolution of the labor unrest, and hoped that it would provide assistance at any time to eliminate disputes.</p>
<p>Investigating the Losses of Both Sides</p>
<p>The Japanese Cotton Spinning Association in China, in order to clarify the total amount of losses suffered by the cotton mills in Shanghai and other places that have experienced strikes, has sent Minami Chuzo and others to visit the factories to investigate and inform each cotton mill to report the losses during the strike period. The Shanghai General Labor Union is also conducting a detailed investigation of the losses suffered by the workers through its investigation section.</p>
<p>Huamei Scheduled to Resume Work</p>
<p>More than 120 male and female workers at the Japanese Huamei Printing and Dyeing Factory at 595 Hejian Road in the Shanghai East District went on strike on the 10th of this month because the factory refused to accept the five conditions they had proposed, such as increased wages. Yesterday, the factory owner, Fukuzo, a Japanese, met with all the workers and, as a result of negotiations, agreed to increase wages by two cents across the board. The remaining conditions will be discussed further after work resumes. Both sides have agreed, so the factory workers have decided to resume work on the 16th of this month.</p>

<p>The state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's business declined and its income was meager in previous years. Since the reorganization this spring, the result of the rectification has been a sharp increase in freight and passenger transport. It is estimated that freight and passenger transport revenue in July increased by more than 11% compared to the same period last year, and in August increased by 48% compared to the same period last year. This has been recorded in various newspapers. It is now learned that the passenger and freight revenue of the company in September this year was 914,119 yuan, 8 jiao, and 3 fen, while the revenue in the same period last year was 589,670 yuan and 5 jiao, an increase of 55% over the total revenue in the same period last year. The revenue in July and August was also higher than previous months. This is not only the result of the company's reorganization, but also a manifestation of the public's support for national shipping, and a precursor to the revival of the entire shipping industry.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Long-Distance Telephone Business Regulations Revised by the Ministry of Communications; Effective Next Month <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The "Long-Distance Telephone Business Regulations" promulgated by the Ministry of Communications in June 1933 were no longer perfect according to the current business situation. Therefore, a new "Domestic Long-Distance Telephone Business Regulations" was formulated, along with a "Domestic Long-Distance Telephone Classification Price Comparison Table" to calculate various telephone charges. It is said that there are many differences between the new regulations and the old regulations. For example, for calling a person by telephone, the caller was required to pay a special fee in addition to the telephone charge under the old regulations. The new regulations have cancelled the special fee, and the calling-a-person telephone and the direct-dialing telephone are charged the same fee. The scope of calling-a-person is limited to 3 kilometers from the bureau. Other details about various telephone procedures, types of calls, and other names are described in detail in the regulations. The aforementioned new regulations have been circulated to all bureaus by the Ministry of Communications and will be implemented starting on December 1 of this year.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Unified Control of Food - Preliminary Measures Proposed <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>This year's agricultural production is abundant. Although unscrupulous merchants previously engaged in large-scale purchasing of rice and grain in Shanghai and inland areas, leading to price increases, the authorities in rice-producing regions strictly prohibited this. Local grain merchants also voluntarily ceased exports. Consequently, food market prices gradually stabilized. In recent days, the market prices of flour and wheat once plummeted. Although there has been a recent rebound, it is not as intense as the previous price surge. The rice market has been declining in recent days, with the highest price being only around ten yuan. However, with the new harvest coming to market, the falling rice prices will affect farmers' economy. Therefore, the authorities will begin by having local areas compile statistics on food production and sales as a preliminary measure for unified food control. A specific plan will first be discussed by the central government, and then relevant authorities from various provinces and cities, as well as leading grain merchants, will be convened for thorough consultation. Afterwards, measures will be implemented step by step to achieve unified effectiveness.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Agricultural Products Extremely Congested on Jinpu Railway Southbound Trains - Urging Consignees to Pick Up Goods Promptly <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Agricultural products southbound from the Jinpu Railway at the Makeng Road Station of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway are extremely congested. The original warehouses are insufficient. Although temporary sheds were added, they were quickly filled. It was necessary to request approval from the Ministry of Railways to shorten the free storage period for arriving goods from five days to three days, so that goods arriving earlier could be picked up promptly to make room for later arrivals. However, it is still impossible to get merchants to pick up goods quickly. As a result, subsequent arrivals cannot be unloaded, and goods still in the rear cannot be transported, greatly hindering the circulation of inland agricultural products. Therefore, another request was made to the Ministry of Railways to charge storage fees for fourth-class and lower goods according to the regulations of 1933 (i.e., 5 fen of national currency per ton per day for carload lots, and 5 li per 25 kilograms for less-than-carload lots). It is hoped that all consignees will pick up their goods promptly to facilitate circulation.</p>

<h3 id="e108">A Brazen Robbery Occurred Last Night in Tongde Lane, Fuxi Road - A Severely Wounded Thief Apprehended - Zhuang Zhiyang's Home Suddenly Robbed - Five Thieves Acting as Lookouts and Searching - Deputy Inspector and Others Bravely Injured - Four Thieves Apprehended and Sent to Hospital <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>At around 6 p.m. yesterday, a robbery occurred in Lane 223, Fuxu Road, in the French Concession. Upon receiving the report, the police dispatched a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to surround and capture the robbers. The robbers fiercely resisted, and both sides exchanged gunfire. As a result, three robbers were shot and captured. Another robber, having sustained three gunshot wounds, had fled to the Labor Hospital on Xiaoshadu Road for treatment. The hospital notified the police, and he was also apprehended. The duty officer leading the police, Deputy Inspector Pancrazi, and two Vietnamese policemen, No. 486, were injured by gunfire while bravely pursuing the robbers. Details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Iron Gates Between Two Lanes</p>
<p>Lane 223, Fuxu Road, is Tongde Lane. It is located west of Bierre Road and east of Juxiangda Road. The entrance to the lane is extremely narrow. About 100 paces into the lane, there are more than ten newly built shikumen houses. The lane connects to Taihe Lane on Bierre Road to the east. There is an iron gate between the two lanes, which is locked all year round and rarely opened. It connects to Yuyang Lane on Pushi Road to the west, with unobstructed passage between them.</p>
<p>The Zhuang Family's Residence</p>
<p>The first house on the east side of the lane, facing south, is No. 16, a three-story detached house. The sub-tenant is Zhuang Zhiyang from Chaozhou (29 years old). Zhuang is currently a compradore in the export department of Dumou Foreign Firm on Hankou Road in the Public Concession. There are many people in the family. Zhuang's entire family lives on the second floor and in the hall downstairs, while the third floor is rented to Sun Yirong from Ningbo, who is currently working in the coffee export department of Taixing Foreign Firm.</p>
<p>Five Thieves Arrive</p>
<p>At 6:15 p.m. yesterday, while a maid was tidying up in the kitchen of the Zhuang residence, three robbers suddenly broke in through the back door: one wearing a blue cloth short jacket, one wearing a gray robe, and one wearing a striped cloth short shirt. Speaking in the local dialect, the three robbers entered the hall on the pretext of asking for someone named Wang. Two other robbers were acting as lookouts at the door. At the time, Zhuang's younger brother, Zhuang Mingfu, was sitting idly in the hall. One of the robbers wearing a blue cloth short jacket immediately pulled out a handgun, forbade him from making any noise, and forced him into the small room in the back hall.</p>
<p>Monitoring the Family</p>
<p>At the same time, one of the two robbers acting as lookouts at the door entered and monitored Zhuang's brother's movements. The three robbers who had entered together went upstairs and drove all the members of the household, totaling more than twenty people, downstairs and confined them in one place with Zhuang's brother. Then, they went upstairs again and began searching. Unexpectedly, when the three robbers entered the hall and showed their handguns, Zhuang Zhiyang's wife's younger brother, Hu Shaohua, who was only twelve years old and quite alert,</p>
<p>A Young Boy Captured</p>
<p>At the time, Hu saw a robber pointing a handgun at Zhuang Mingfu and knew they were not good people. He first scurried upstairs. The three robbers did not pay attention in the confusion. Hu went up to the third floor, crossed the drying terrace to the adjacent house at No. 17, and exited through the front door of No. 17. He passed through Yuyang Lane and ran to the intersection of Pushi Road and Bierre Road to report to the patrol officer there. Upon receiving the report, the patrol officer immediately reported to the Songshan Road Police Station. The police chief immediately dispatched the reserve team leader, Mei Yi, to rush to the scene first, and then telephoned the Lujiiawan General Police Station to request assistance.</p>
<p>Police Arrive Together</p>
<p>Upon receiving the report, the Lujiiawan Police Station immediately dispatched the duty officer, Deputy Inspector Pancrazi, together with Russian detective S. Taixi Gu, and the general reserve and Chinese and foreign detectives, to rush to the scene. They first surrounded the lane from the outside, then broke down the back door. At the time, one of the robbers monitoring the people downstairs knew things were not good and shouted loudly upstairs. The three robbers rushed downstairs, all planning to open the front door and escape.</p>
<p>Mutual Assault and Severe Wounding</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the detectives outside the front door had long been lying in ambush on all sides. The two robbers who came out first were seen by the detectives hidden at the door of No. 17 next door, who quickly fired several shots. Both robbers fell to the ground. The two robbers at the rear then fired their guns from inside the door and rushed out. Bullets flew like locusts. The detectives also bravely returned fire, and the two sides exchanged dozens of shots. Deputy Inspector Pancrazi, in particular, charged forward regardless of his safety. The melee lasted for a quarter of an hour. As a result, three robbers were injured and captured. Pancrazi and Vietnamese policeman No. 486 were also shot in the left leg.</p>
<p>The Wounded Sent to Hospital</p>
<p>After the three robbers were wounded and captured, two other robbers escaped. The detectives searched all the lanes but found no trace of them. They took the three robbers back to the police station. After strict interrogation by the police chief, it was learned that one was Gu Rongsheng, 27 years old, one was Wang Rongsheng, 20 years old, and one was Yang Silin, 43 years old. All admitted to conspiring to rob. The three robbers were all wounded in the abdomen and were taken to the Guangci Hospital on Jin Shenfu Road, along with Deputy Inspector Pancrazi and Vietnamese policeman No. 486.</p>
<p>A Young Boy Seeking Treatment</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, while the French police were handling the aftermath, they suddenly received a telephone call from the Public Concession police station, stating that the Labor Hospital on Xiaoshadu Road had just reported that a young boy with three gunshot wounds had come to seek treatment. The hospital, because it was a gunshot wound, specifically notified the police to inquire whether there had been a shooting incident in the French Concession. Upon hearing the news, the French police immediately ordered detectives to rush to the scene. After interrogation, it was learned that he was one of the five robbers who resisted arrest. He was transferred to the French police station. He claimed to be Wang Aiqing, 42 years old, from Jiangyin. The robe worn by the robber was stolen from the Zhuang family. Seeing that the robber was seriously injured, the police chief first sent him to Guangci Hospital.</p>
<p>Cooperation with the People</p>
<p>Afterwards, according to the victim's statement, in addition to the Zhuang family being robbed of more than one hundred yuan and a gold diamond ring, the tenant on the third floor, Sun Yirong, also had a leather bag stolen, containing 34 yuan, as well as a pair of gold earrings. However, some of the stolen goods were recovered from the robbers. Therefore, the actual loss was minimal. Afterwards, according to the police, residents in the concession should deal with robbery alarms carefully, report to the police when the opportunity arises, and the police will do their best to apprehend the criminals and cooperate with the residents. This time, the alertness of the twelve-year-old boy Hu Shaohua in reporting the incident after crossing the roof was invaluable.</p>

<p>The Great American Evening News says that Mr. Hai Caiwei, 23 years old, from Los Angeles, USA, took the road from India to Central Asia to China last year. He suddenly disappeared on the way. For a time, relatives and friends and American consular officials were worried about his safety. Recently, he arrived in Beiping from Guihua, and the world knew that he had trekked through Xinjiang and Mongolia to North China. Now he has arrived in Shanghai by train from Beiping and is staying with his friend Melvin, who came to Shanghai from Los Angeles to find him. The two will soon leave for Los Angeles. Hai's mother is a writer and deeply misses her son. Seeing her beloved son returning home after enduring many dangers, she will be overjoyed. When Hai arrived in Guihua, he ran out of travel expenses and borrowed money to get to Beiping. After arriving in Shanghai, he did not describe the hardships he had experienced on the journey. It is said that he plans to write a manuscript and sell it to an American newspaper to compensate for his losses on the way. According to Hai, he left the United States a year ago and arrived in Bombay in November. He then went to Johor and found a short-term job making a film. In January of this year, he arrived in Beixiawa and took the road to Srinagar, crossing the mountain pass in winter, almost losing his life. While living in Srinagar, he converted to Islam. He then went to East Kashmir. Hearing that war had broken out in Central Asia, he decided to enter Xinjiang, so he learned Turkish and, with a Turk as a guide, disguised himself as a local and set off. In June, he arrived in Kashgar and met with the British consul there. He then set off for Dihua and disappeared. It is now known that after Hai arrived in Dihua, the Russian officials there suspected him of being a spy and imprisoned him. He was imprisoned for 116 days and tortured in prison, wanting to force him to confess. Hai then went on a hunger strike to resist. Finally, with the intercession of Russian officials elsewhere, he was released. His money, luggage, films, and notebooks were confiscated, and he was only given travel expenses to leave the Xinjiang border. Hai then arrived in Hami. He probably took a car from the Xinsui Automobile Transportation Company from there to Guihua. His experiences could make a great adventure travelogue. It is said that Hai plans to ask the Moscow authorities to instruct the Russian officials in Dihua to return the confiscated items.</p>

<p>Zhang Hongquan from Xiashi came to Shanghai from his hometown a few days ago to purchase goods and was temporarily staying in Room 3 of the Shuhua Hotel on Shandong Road. Suddenly, at 12:30 p.m. yesterday, he received a letter from his friend Ye Wenkang. After opening it, he learned that he was invited to meet at Room 519 of the Nanjing Hotel at No. 200 Shanxi Road to discuss kerosene business. Zhang Hongquan went there at around 2 p.m. At Room 519 on the fifth floor, he saw an unfamiliar person who asked Zhang whom he was looking for. Zhang immediately asked for Ye Wenkang. The person replied that Ye Wenkang had booked a room today and was in Room 424 downstairs, and that he (the person claiming himself) could take him there. Zhang followed him to Room 424 on the fourth floor and saw two other unfamiliar people inside. As they were questioning each other, another person closed the door. Two people immediately pulled out handguns and threatened Zhang, wanting to borrow 20,000 yuan. At this time, he realized he had been deceived. He immediately told the two people that he had no money to lend. The two people searched him and robbed him of 390 yuan in national currency and a gold watch. The three people then fled. After about ten minutes, Zhang opened the door and went outside. The three people had disappeared. He reported to the hotel accountant and inquired about the situation. The hotel accountant said that at around 9 a.m. yesterday, two people came to book this room, claiming to be Li Wencheng. At that time, they paid 6 yuan for the room. The letter signed by Ye Wenkang was forged by these three people. Afterwards, the accountant reported to the police station in charge, who sent detectives to investigate in order to track down the criminals.</p>

<p>Li Lili, a local woman, 28 years old, who is proficient in English, runs an apartment at No. 15 Jingan Villa on Jingan Temple Road. In June of this year, a Greek woman, Pavlena Stanesko, came to the apartment and said that she could tell people's fortunes with playing cards, and that she was extremely accurate. At that time, Li asked her to calculate for a fee of one yuan. Pavlena then flattered her with flowery words, eventually causing Li to fall into her trap. Pavlena then took the opportunity to say that if she wanted to make her destiny prosperous, she must offer a piece of gold jewelry to the gods, but that the item would be returned after a week. At that time, Li immediately handed over a gold ring inlaid with gemstones to Pavlena to ask the gods for help. Pavlena refused to accept it because the ring was not pure gold. Li then handed over a gold bracelet (worth about 50 yuan) worn on her arm to Pavlena. Unexpectedly, Pavlena never came again after a week, and her whereabouts have been unknown ever since. Recently, Li encountered Pavlena on Yapei Road and asked for the bracelet back. Pavlena claimed that after receiving the bracelet, she had gone to Harbin for business and had just returned to Shanghai, so she would return it in a few days. Li believed her, but she still failed to keep her promise. Knowing that she was a swindler, Li met Pavlena again at the intersection of Jingan Temple Road and Hadong Road at 3:30 p.m. the day before yesterday. She called Chinese detective Ni Jiafeng to arrest Pavlena and take her to the Jingan Temple Police Station. Yesterday, she was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the Special First Court. The police station lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, explained the previous situation and prosecuted her for fraud under Article 339 of the Criminal Code, claiming that the gold bracelet had been sold by the defendant to a Russian woman for about 14 or 15 yuan. Li Lili then gave evidence. Interrogated, Pavlena confessed that Li had repeatedly asked me to tell her fortune in the summer, asking if she would succeed in loving an American man and get married. At that time, the results of my calculations made Li very satisfied, and she also ordered me to tell the fortunes of the residents of her apartment, with all the fortune-telling money being paid to her. Later, she gave me a gold bracelet as a gift. When I met her on Xiafei Road last time, she claimed that she could not achieve the purpose I had calculated, so she wanted to ask for the bracelet back. The bracelet was actually given to me by her, not obtained by trickery. After Judge Ye Shengchao verified the confession, he immediately announced the verdict in court, sentencing Pavlena to 30 days of detention to serve as a warning.</p>

<p>Wang Xiuzhen, a woman from Tianjin, 17 years old, was walking along Datong Road in Zhabei a month ago when she saw an apple on the ground. When she bent down to pick it up, an old woman, Wang Hua, touched the girl's head. The girl immediately fell into a coma and was taken to Li Wang's home in Gaoshou Lane, Haining Road. After one night, she was sent to the Oriental Hotel, where she listened to a man's rape. Then, she was taken to the China Hotel in the North Station to sell her. She was arrested by the police and sent to the Public Security Bureau, who sent her to the local court. After investigation, the prosecutor charged Wang Hua with using stupefacients to abduct a good family woman for prostitution, and prosecuted her for violating family integrity. After an inquiry, the victim gave a detailed account of the previous situation. Yesterday, Judge Shao held another hearing. Wang Hua confessed that she did open the Oriental Hotel with the girl, and the name on the sign, Wang Deshan, was written by the waiter. Only Li Wang, who was considered an accessory, did not come. I also opened the China Hotel, but the girl was driven out by the waiter because she was crying. She was caught by the police. I planned to marry the girl as my daughter-in-law and received 300 yuan from a man named Cai. At this point, Prosecutor Tang gave his opinion, saying that the defendants had all admitted to opening a room with Wang Xiuzhen, so please sentence them according to law. After the defendant delayed for a while to allow Lawyer Xue Jiaqi to make his defense, the official ordered the debate to end, and the sentence will be announced on the 21st.</p>

<p>At 11 p.m. on the 13th, the Detaixin Inn at No. 160 Baliao Bridge Road (i.e., West Xinqiao Street) in the French Concession came to stay with a male and female traveler. The man claimed his name was Wang A Gen, 24 years old, from Fengxian. The woman claimed her name was Zhou, 19 years old. The two were a couple. The waiter led them upstairs and opened Room 5 to stay in. At 3 a.m., the man Wang A Gen came downstairs and went out, leaving the woman inside overnight. At 10 a.m. yesterday, the waiter Ding Ziwen (39 years old, from Shanghai) urged the woman to get up because he was cleaning the room. He knocked on the door and called for a long time without response. When he pried open the door and went inside, he found that the woman had already died in bed. Four empty opium boxes were found by her pillow, and a card was left on the table in front of the bed, with a long-term prostitution card from Pei Pei, No. 1 of Fuyu Lane 2. He immediately reported to the French police, who sent detective Jiang Changwen and detective Zhang Chunsheng to investigate. Two pawn tickets (one for 14 yuan, one for 1.1 yuan) and 10 copper coins were found on the deceased's body, and nothing else. According to the card, the detectives went to Pei Pei's house in Fuyu Lane to investigate. They learned that the deceased's real name was Zhou Aibao, 19 years old, from a village in Suzhou. She was already engaged but not yet married. She came to Shanghai to work as a helper. She had a sister-in-law, Zhou Wang, who worked as a helper at No. 8 Hongyun Lane on Kaizi Er Road in the French Concession. However, she did not know the man Wang A Gen who opened the room with the deceased, and did not know who he was. The police station reported to Prosecutor Wang Ren of the Special Second Court, who, along with a forensic doctor and clerk, came to examine the body at noon. The deceased's sister-in-law, Zhou Wang, had not yet arrived. The official questioned the hotel waiter Ding Ziwen and learned that Zhou had committed suicide by poisoning. The body was handed over to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall for collection and burial, and relatives were summoned to claim it. Whether the defendant Wang A Gen had instigated or helped suicide was ordered to be investigated and dealt with by the police department. Four opium boxes with a small amount of opium were confiscated by the court. In the afternoon, the deceased's sister-in-law Zhou Wang arrived at the examination site and identified the body. She said that the deceased had dinner at her home on the 11th night and then went out, saying she was going to Ximen Road. She did not know the reason for her suicide. The French police are currently investigating the fugitive Wang A Gen in order to understand the truth about the deceased's suicide.</p>

<p>Hua Liusheng, 57 years old, a local, lived with his brother Jifang (also known as Axiang, 62 years old) in Zhujiazhai on Bairinan Road in West Shanghai, making a living by farming. The ancestral land had already been divided and each had established their own household. Jifang had two sons, the eldest named Jinting and the youngest named Baoxing. Seeing that his uncle Liusheng had no children, he planned to seize the property and had repeatedly tried to harm him. On the evening of June 1 of this year, Jifang and his two sons used a kitchen knife and bamboo shoot shovel to chop off Liusheng's leg bones in the dark, and his whole body was also injured by knives. Liusheng shouted for help, and his neighbors arrested Jifang and his youngest son Baoxing and sent them to the Caojiadu Public Security Branch Bureau, who transferred them to the General Bureau. The local court sentenced the father and son to one year of imprisonment each. Jifang and others refused to accept the sentence and are currently appealing. In the meantime, they were released on bail. Liu Sheng's chopped leg bones recently relapsed and became seriously injured. Although he was sent to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment, it was ineffective. He died yesterday morning. His family reported to the Public Security Branch Bureau in charge, and Axiang and Baoyu were arrested. The local baozhang of the Fourth District requested the court to send personnel to examine the body. Yesterday at around 3 p.m., the prosecutor went to examine the body.

<p>Li Qianshi, a woman from Yangzhou, lives at No. 469 Tokyo Road, West Shanghai. Her eighteen-year-old daughter, Li Huazhen, works at the Tongxing Cotton Mill on Macau Road. Dai Sanwuzi (also known as Dai Shishun), a twenty-one-year-old Yangzhou native and owner of the Weiwu Barber Shop at No. 188 Haifang Road, saw Li Huazhen passing by his shop daily. He used deceptive tactics, following her and making suggestive remarks, claiming he was without a wife and wished to marry her. Li, young and naive, fell for his scheme. Starting in February of this year, Dai often accompanied Li to secret rendezvous at the Zhongxing Hotel on Rue Robert, where they indulged in intimacy. Unbeknownst to them, a pregnancy began. By the third month, her belly grew, but for the sake of appearances, she decided to remove the fetus to prevent her mother from finding out. On the 4th of last month, Dai, through his neighbor Chen Xu, nicknamed "Yangzhou Big Sister," asked Gao Shishi, a fifty-year-old Suzhou widow and midwife living in a bungalow at No. 116, South Chengdu Road, to perform an abortion. They agreed on a fee of eight yuan. On the same day, Gao inserted a section of equisetum grass into Li Huazhen's lower body. Three days later, the fetus was expelled. However, Li's condition deteriorated significantly after the abortion, and she sought medical treatment. After many days, her condition did not improve. In a panic, Li Qianshi reported the matter to the police on the 28th of last month. Detective Ye Yushan and an ambulance were dispatched to take Li Huazhen to Guangren Hospital for treatment while secretly investigating all involved parties. Fearing exposure, Dai Sanwuzi and the others fled. The police requested the First Special Court to issue arrest warrants. On the day before yesterday, Detective Ye arrested Dai Sanwuzi, Chen Xu, and Gao Shishi. They were separately detained at the Xinzha Police Station and escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang charged them with abortion under Articles 292 and 290 of the Criminal Code, stating that the defendants had confessed and provided statements while at the police station. Li Huazhen remains ill at Guangren Hospital, and her life may still be in danger. When questioned, Dai Sanwuzi not only denied the abortion but also claimed he did not know Li at all. Chen Xu also denied introducing the abortion. When questioned, Gao Shishi admitted that she was introduced by Chen Xu and used equisetum grass to perform an abortion on Li, receiving eight yuan, without denying anything. Gao hired lawyer Ma Leming for defense. Judge Huang Risheng reviewed the statements and declared the case concluded. The verdict is set for the 21st. All defendants are to remain in custody separately.</p>

<p>On August 13th at 10:00 AM and September 30th at 5:40 PM this year, Xiang Honggen, an employee of the Ninghe Pig Firm at No. 52 Yuezhou Road, and of the Wusong Shentai Pig Firm, was collecting debts at No. 46, Lane Zhoujiazui, when he was robbed of a total of 1,280 yuan by multiple bandits. After investigation, Huajia Police Station detectives Shao Jingfan and Yao Yuanlong, and officers Ma Bingzhang and Li Yinmin, successively arrested the bandits involved: Yuan Linjiang, Xue A'gen, Zhang Shibao, Zhu Caibao, Wang Liangbao, and those already under investigation (Zhu Pinquan, Wang A'mao, and Zheng Jinsheng, who were involved in the Yuezhou Road robbery). A pistol and three bullets were found at Xue A'gen's home. The police investigation revealed that the gun and bullets were planted by Gu A'er, a resident of No. 5 Yuezhou Road from Changzhou, through Xu A'huan, to frame Yuan Linjiang and Zhang Shibao, because they are all involved in the pig slaughtering business and Gu had a grudge against Xue from a previous dispute over pig purchases. Gu and Xu were arrested and handed over to the First Special District Court. After investigation and trial, they awaited sentencing on record. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhong Qing presided over the Third Criminal Court and ruled as follows: Yuan Linjiang and Zhang Shibao were each sentenced to five years and six months of imprisonment. Zhu Caibao was sentenced to six years. Wang Liangbao, Zhu Pinquan, Wang A'mao, and Zheng Jinsheng were each sentenced to seven years. Gu A'er and Xu A'huan, for jointly intending to cause criminal punishment to others and fabricating evidence, were each sentenced to six months, suspended for two years. Public Works Bureau lawyer Zhang Shizhu claimed that the seized firearm was related to the robbery and fatal shooting of Chen Buzhao, a Siyang native, at No. 70 Yangshupu Road on May 27th last year between 9:45 PM and 10:30 PM. He requested that it be temporarily kept by the police station, which the court approved. Gu A'er and Xu A'huan each posted 1,000 yuan in cash or a bond during the appeal period.</p>

<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, the city's Tobacco Industry Association received a letter yesterday from the Xuchang Transportation Industry Association stating that Su Roulan, Mei Ken, Mai Long, and Chinese nationals Su Shisan, Tan Zhongfan, and Zhao Xiaoyan, all from the Shanghai Lianhua Tobacco Company, went to Xuchang to investigate the tobacco industry. However, their passports stated that they were going to the county to conduct business and planned to rent houses and purchase tobacco silk. This action violates the regulations that prohibit foreigners from doing business in the interior. After receiving the letter, the association believed that Xuchang is the only tobacco-producing region. If foreign merchants are allowed to purchase, the industry will be unable to operate. In addition to petitioning the provincial government for strict prohibition and issuing a notice refusing to rent houses, they dispatched two representatives yesterday to investigate the truth and seek appropriate solutions.</p>

The "Donate Airplanes for Birthday Greetings" Memorial Committee, to expand publicity and express respect, created portraits of Generalissimo Chiang and slogans for purchasing aircraft for birthday greetings. Furthermore, the Central Photography Studio sent personnel to Shanghai to request the screening of a birthday greeting film in various cinemas. All cinemas in the city complied, except for the Nanjing, Da Guangming, and Shanghai Cathay cinemas, which refused to screen the film. Despite repeated appeals from the committee, these cinemas also refused to participate in the donation drive. The "Donate Airplanes for Birthday Greetings" is an effort to expand the national aviation salvation movement and support the leader. We should do our best to contribute and fulfill our duty. The actions of these cinemas are despised by the nation. It is reported that various circles are extremely dissatisfied, and the central government has sent special personnel to Shanghai to investigate and decide on sanctions, with a warning. The "One Day of Labor" for Aviation Salvation and Birthday Greetings donation drive is enthusiastically supported by all parties. The Cosmetics Industry Association decided that on the 21st of this month, the businesses in the industry will donate 10% of their total daily revenue, and employees will donate one day's salary, to the "Donate Airplanes for Birthday Greetings" donation drive. The Chinese and Foreign Sundries Industry Association is scheduled to hold a meeting on the 17th of this month to discuss scheduling the event. The Western Clothing Industry Association has already held a meeting and appointed several committee members to conduct donation drives among the industry, which is proceeding smoothly. Several hundred yuan have already been collected and will be remitted soon.</p>
<p>The Aircraft Donation Memorial Committee has remitted the first batch of 330,000 yuan, the second batch of 100,000 yuan, and the third batch of 70,000 yuan to the Chiang Kai-shek Birthday Aircraft Donation Memorial Committee.

The total tungseed production in Zhejiang Province is approximately 200,000 dan, which can be entirely pressed into tung oil within four months.

<p>The Zhang brothers, Zhang Wenxing and Zhang Zhifan, from Fujian, opened the Guohua Obstetrics Hospital at No. 134 Kunming Road, with Zhang Zhifan serving as the director, but actual power was wielded by Zhang Wenxing. Di Baolin, a woman from Changzhou, served as a nurse at the hospital. Di's cousin, Wang Manying, does not have a permanent address in Shanghai, so all her correspondence was entrusted to Di for collection. On the 29th of last month, Wang Manying suddenly received a fast letter from her younger brother in Xiaoshi, stating that he had previously sent ten yuan by double-registered mail to Guohua Hospital, but had not received any response. He did not know if it had been received. Wang was surprised and asked Di, who claimed she had not received such a letter. Di then asked the Zhang brothers, who also said they had not received it. Wang reported the matter to the Huishan Police Station. Detective Shen Binkui went to the post office to investigate and discovered that a registered letter was indeed sent to Guohua Hospital, care of Di Baolin, for Wang Manying, on the 22nd of last month, and that Zhang Wenxing of the hospital had signed for it. Later, the post office investigator, Zhu Wenyi, went to the hospital to have the stamp re-applied by Zhang Zhifan. The detectives concluded that the Zhang brothers were highly suspected of involvement in the case and arrested them yesterday. As Zhang Wenxing had already fled, only Zhang Zhifan was apprehended. He was escorted to the Fifth Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Jiang Baoli charged him with obstructing secrets and theft under Articles 315 and 320 of the Criminal Code. As Zhang Wenxing still needs to be apprehended, he requested a postponement for further questioning. After testimony was taken from the postman No. 47 and others, Zhang Zhifan denied the charges when questioned. Judge Zhan Liangce reviewed the statements and ordered the case to be postponed for further investigation.</p>

However, if the debtors provide the aforementioned requested amount or securities of equivalent value as collateral, they may apply to have the provisional seizure suspended or revoked.

<p>Wu Wuming, a 46-year-old Suzhou native residing at No. 117 Rue Amiral Schwerer in the French Concession, engaged in the business of jade and antique trade. He recently engaged a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Second Criminal Court of the Special Court, accusing his fellow villager Zhang Wendi, residing next door at No. 119, of embezzlement and breach of trust. According to the lawsuit, the plaintiff, the defendant, and other shareholders invested capital to establish the Huazhen Company in this city to engage in the jade business, with the defendant serving as the manager and the plaintiff serving as the shareholder and chairman of the board. During the Chicago World's Fair in the United States in 1933, Zhang Xianglin and Huazhen Company jointly formed the Sihe Company, and the defendant took jade items to the United States for the fair. After returning to China two years later, the expenses were considerable. In July of last year, the Huazhen Company held a board meeting, and the defendant submitted the income and expenditure accounts from the United States. It was resolved to audit the accounts, but the defendant refused to hand them over. After the plaintiff filed a lawsuit in the Civil Court of this court, the defendant was ordered to hand over the accounts. The defendant handed over eight account books and a small book of income and expenditure accounts from the United States, which were entrusted to accountant Pan Xulun for auditing. The audit revealed seven points of false and incomplete accounting by the defendant, including: inflated commissions of over 12,890 US dollars; inflated jade tax and levies of over 5,450 US dollars; inflated public relations expenses for goods sold of over 1,030 US dollars; inflated entertainment expenses for sales litigation of 250 US dollars; unauthorized payment of public relations fees of 500 US dollars; unauthorized living expenses of 1,000 US dollars; embezzlement of a remaining balance of 634.75 US dollars and 225.76 yuan in national currency from the US fair accounts. The plaintiff requested legal investigation and prosecution. Upon receiving the complaint, the court, presided over by Judge Chen Shuoying, summoned the parties to the Second Criminal Court yesterday. Both parties, accompanied by lawyers, appeared in court. After questioning by the court, it was decided to postpone the hearing to the 25th and ordered the defendant to submit a written defense to the court as soon as possible for review.</p>

It is said that after the exhibition in Gaoqiao, it will be shown on tour in various rural areas to expand publicity.</p>

<p>Jingde is located in the mountains of southern Anhui. Recently, it has been affected by natural disasters and man-made calamities, and an increasing number of people have come to Shanghai to make a living. They are scattered throughout Shanghai, without any effort to unite or foster mutual assistance. Although there is an Anhui Fellow-Countrymen's Association, its scope is too broad, and small counties are often neglected. Therefore, fellow-countrymen's associations divided by county are springing up one after another. Fellow countrymen from Jingde, in order to connect emotionally and jointly seek public welfare, have initiated a motion to establish a Jingde Fellow-Countrymen's Association in Shanghai. They have temporarily borrowed the Minzhong School on Xilin Heng Road, Ximen, as the meeting place and have chosen 2:00 PM on November 29th to hold the first preparatory meeting. Fellow countrymen from Jingde are urged to participate at that time.</p>

<p>B. Related to August</p>
<p>In August, there were five important changes in the financial industry under the special industries category:</p>
<p>1. China Industrial Bank Cuts Two Offices—The bank was prepared by the Ministry of Finance under order in the 4th year of the Republic (1915), and was established in April of the 8th year of the Republic (1919). The fixed capital was 20 million national currency units, and the actual paid-up amount was 3.50704 million yuan. It was a joint-stock company and was specially permitted by the government to issue banknotes. Since its opening, its business has been very good. After the currency system reform last year, the banknotes issued by the bank were ordered to be gradually merged and collected by the Bank of Communications. The prize-winning savings it handled was also transferred to the Central Trust Bureau. Therefore, the original business has been slightly reduced. After the death of the bank's president, Mr. Hu Mengjia, in June of this year, the bank's chairman, Mr. Gong Xianzhou, concurrently took over. Since taking office, Gong has been determined to rectify the situation. Since the Yuyuan Road and Hongkou offices were no longer necessary, they were merged into the Nanjing Road and Beijing Road offices respectively to continue operations.</p>
<p>2. Shanghai Silk Industry Commercial Savings Bank Cuts Branches—The recent reorganization of the bank has been detailed in last month's report. Recently, in order to adjust the business policy and save various expenses, the Hongkou, Western District, and Baxianqiao branches were merged into the head office to handle business. This is also one of the rectification plans of Mr. Lu Zidong, the new general manager of the bank since taking office.</p>

<p>Ma Anquan, the "Allison" of the Chinese tennis world, defeated Li Pizu in straight sets yesterday to win this year's Shanghai French Chamber of Commerce Hard Court Tennis Singles Championship. (Note: Mr. Ma's spirit and posture are very similar to those of the famous American tennis player Allison, hence the name.) Mr. Ma was previously the junior singles champion of the Grass Court Tournament. For several years, there has been no significant progress, but his hitting technique is skilled, and his experience is quite rich. In this hard court tournament, he successively defeated Western players such as Korasha and Canavanlo. It was known early on that he had the highest hopes of winning the title. Li Pizu, the Nanjing champion, came to Shanghai to participate. In the quarter-finals, he eliminated Shen Meizhen, who had defeated Sguia. His skills are also commendable, but due to nervousness and unstable forehand strokes, he was defeated by Ma Anquan. The other match, originally the women's doubles final, was temporarily changed to the singles final. The opponents were Mrs. Klenov and Mrs. Hailey. Both players were skilled and the match was tense. The performance was more intense and exciting than the men's singles. In the end, Mrs. Klenov won the championship with a score of two to one. The results of the two matches are as follows:</p>
<p>Ma vs. Li: Ma Anquan controlled the game with his all-around hitting technique. Li Pizu's backhand was also quite steady, but his forehand was weak and uncertain. He was also somewhat nervous at the beginning of the match, allowing Ma to win five consecutive games and take the first set with a score of six to one. At the beginning of the second set, Li Pizu was able to calm down and respond calmly, so the situation suddenly changed, with a tendency to come from behind. He took the lead with three to one, four to two, and five to four. But at this critical moment, Ma Anquan emerged late and created a six-to-six tie. The subsequent battle became tense. Li Pizu repeatedly tried to make a big move, but failed, and was beaten by Ma with eight to six consecutive wins.</p>
<p>In the third set, Li Pizu suffered a setback from the previous set's near success, and his morale seemed to be somewhat frustrated. Ma Anquan rose sharply, his spirits lifted, and five to zero was again hung high on the scoreboard. In the sixth game, Ma served and was ahead with 40-15. He only needed to add another point to complete the task. Li Pizu made a final struggle, suddenly rising to prominence and breaking Ma's serve. He then won the next game, making the score five to two. But in the end, he failed to reverse the situation and was beaten by Ma with six to two, creating a straight-set result and winning the championship. The two players' battle was slow and lacked highlights.</p>
<p>Women's Final: The women's singles final, before the Ma-Li battle, featured Mrs. Klenov, who was stout and had sharp shots, and Mrs. Hailey, who was like a piece of chewing gum, chasing the ball at the baseline with extraordinary steadiness. The two players' performance was far better than the Ma-Li battle, and the tension and fierce competition made the audience excited and appreciative.</p>
<p>Today's Schedule: Today's final schedule is as follows: (1) Women's Doubles: Mrs. Moore and Mrs. Lam vs. Mrs. Hailey and Miss Massey, starting at 1:30 PM on the third court. (2) Men's Doubles: Ma Anquan and Zhou Guanren vs. Li Guofan and Hu Xuguang, starting at 2:30 PM also on the third court. (3) Mixed Doubles: Mrs. Moore and Mr. DeFou vs. Mr. and Mrs. Klenov, starting at 2:30 PM on the second court.</p>

<p>Jinan's football team played St. Francis yesterday at Shen Garden for the Western League Group A match. The Saint team was the champion of Group B last season and was promoted to Group A. Since starting, they had won many battles and achievements. Other than victories against Portugal and Sokol, they had drawn with Lancashire with a score of 1-1. Therefore, for yesterday's match against Jinan, Jinan had little chance of winning. Unexpectedly, after the competition, Jinan won 2-0, and many good opportunities were missed. Otherwise, they could have scored a half dozen more goals. The St. team's morale was lax. Other than the start, when they were aggressive and enterprising, the rest of the time, they had no room for development. After that, Jinan marched forward and created a victory. The lineups for both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>Jinan Team</p>
<p>Ye Peichu</p>
<p>Chen Chunxiu Chen Zhenxiang</p>

<p>The St. John's University football team, the only team to promote American football among foreigners, played against the McTyeire American School team for many years. The students of both schools were very interested, and various cheering squads cheered and supported them on the field to enliven the enthusiastic ball game.</p>
<p>The two teams met for the first time two weeks ago. The two sides were evenly matched and in high spirits. As a result, each scored six points, resulting in a tie. Yesterday, the two teams met again at McTyeire American School. The St. John's team, after intensive training in the past two weeks, made rapid progress in their ball skills. As a result, they defeated McTyeire by a large margin of 19 to 6.</p>
<p>The St. John's team often used surprise tactics to break through the opponent's defense line, and their commands were well-coordinated, leaving the McTyeire team at a loss. The enthusiastic cheers of the McTyeire girls ultimately failed to save their warriors from defeat.</p>

<p>Initiate the Organization - Secondary School Federation</p>
<p>With Principals as the Organizational Unit</p>
<p>(Shanghai News) Lin Meiyan, Tong Hangbai, Huang Zaoxiong, Chen Jicheng, and other principals from ten schools in this city, including Da Gong Vocational School, Min Li Women's Middle School, Jun Yi Middle School, and Private Shang Zhong, have initiated the organization of the city-wide Secondary School Federation, with the principals of each school as the organizational unit. The initiators are currently carrying out preparations, and the origins are recorded below:</p>
<p>Origins - Shanghai is the hub of Chinese culture, and the education industry is also the most developed in Shanghai. All facilities, whether good or bad, are enough to affect the whole country and the future of the nation. The purpose of education is to improve the past life, grasp the current trend, and create the future culture. Its greatest key should be consistent with the national policy of reviving the nation. We have been engaged in education for decades, or at least more than ten years. We all regard educating young people and transforming society as our lifelong duty, and we all regard reviving the nation as the only guiding principle for education. However, although the goals are the same, the methods may not necessarily be consistent. The reason is that the secondary schools in Shanghai have never had adequate contact. They have no active contribution to the education authorities, and the schools themselves are self-governing and cannot learn from each other's strengths and help each other. Although it is said that different paths lead to the same goal, it is difficult to increase the rate of implementing the education policy. Moreover, the current situation is serious, and the national affairs are in danger. To cope with the environment in extraordinary times, there must be education in extraordinary times. Our responsibilities lie in, we cannot tolerate ignoring, so we organize the Shanghai Secondary School Federation, in order to polish and discuss, so that secondary education can be reasonably rebuilt and developed, which is not only for unity and communication of feelings. Initiators: Lin Meiyan of Da Gong Vocational School, Tong Hangbai of Min Li Women's Middle School, Huang Zaoxiong of Jun Yi Middle School, Chen Jicheng of Private Shanghai Middle School, Zai Manyun of Pudong Middle School, Gu Huayuan of Huahua Middle School, Zhao Shusheng of Minli Middle School, Mai Foru of Zhonghua Vocational School, Feng Yixian of Huben Middle School, and Tao Guangchuan of Jingye Middle School. The mailing address is temporarily located in the Shanghai Education Association, Daji Road, Nanshi, this city.</p>

<h3 id="e177">Yarn and Cotton - Many Parties Taking Advantage of Low Prices - Yarn Market Easy to Rise and Difficult to Fall - Recent Price Increases Intensifying - Prices Close to Spot Yarn <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to be strong, and the recent price increases in yarn are intensifying. Many parties are strongly controlling and manipulating the market, and they are also cooperating with Indian merchants in their publicity. Therefore, the market situation in recent months has been quite stable. At the same time, Osaka Sanpin yarn has also risen, so buyers have become more active. Securities and gold industries are providing strong support. However, spot yarn sales are still sluggish. The price of this month's standard yarn is not far from the price of spot yarn.</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Rises More Than Two Yuan Again</p>
<p>The standard yarn market opened this morning, and the near-month momentum was very tight. It was slightly looser when auctioned to the far-month. After the second round, it was heard that Osaka Sanpin yarn had a sharp increase this month, and it was also reported that a long-term company had been organized, and the market situation was strong and gradually rising. However, spot yarn production has not been very smooth. However, many parties buy whenever prices are low, so the market has become easy to rise and difficult to fall. As a result, each month rose by 1.67 yuan compared with the closing price of the previous day. When the market opened in the afternoon, the situation in this month was very strong, and floating households were making up for their positions, and the market price rose slowly. However, spot yarn transactions were sluggish. As a result, this month rose by another 1.3 yuan compared with the morning closing price, and the distant month rose by 0.2 yuan. It was found that Hengsan sold 3,000 bales, Juxing 1,150 bales, Dafeng 1,450 bales, Gengfeng 3,000 bales, Ruida 2,000 bales, Shenji 2,850 bales, Changfeng 2,950 bales, Changji 1,750 bales, Xicheng 1,000 bales, Changyu 700 bales, and Taichang 700 bales. Yuda bought 3,400 bales, Jifeng 1,000 bales, Mingde 3,050 bales, Huamao 1,800 bales, Fengtai 1,250 bales, Wangtaixing 2,100 bales, Dachangcheng 1,650 bales, Runkang 1,500 bales, Fukang 1,300 bales, Zhenda 1,450 bales, Dachang 1,350 bales, and Zhengji 800 bales.

<p>The cotton market is still strong because the market is rumored to be suffering from a large reduction in this year's cotton production. This situation still needs to be proven by facts. At the same time, the yarn market is rising steadily, and factories are making huge profits. Some of them also tend to buy and go long. The market price has been raised by the yarn market. However, the overseas cotton market is bleak and lifeless.</p>
<p>Standard Cotton Rises 0.3-0.4 Yuan Again</p>
<p>The standard cotton market opened this morning, and the momentum was gentle due to the mediocre American and Indian cotton markets. After the second round, the market sentiment was peaceful, and the atmosphere was calm. The trend was peaceful. Buyers were not as eager as in the yarn market. As a result, each month rose by 5 cents compared with the morning closing price. It was found that Tonghe sold 12,100 dan, Xincheng 8,400 dan, Yikang 5,200 zu, Yuanxingchang 2,500 dan, Xingchang 1,100 dan, Shengyuan 5,500 dan, Ruida 9,000 dan, Zhenda 3,900 dan, Jinchang 1,200 dan, Yuanda 1,800 dan, Dafeng 1,600 dan, Hengyi 1,600 dan, and Changhe 1,400 dan.

<h3 id="e179">The Yarn and Cotton Market After the Shortened Month Period <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Yarn and Cotton Change Security Deposit - The standard yarn and cotton market of the China Merchants Yarn and Cloth Exchange has been extremely developed recently. Securities groups and gold groups have joined the yarn and cloth market because their own operations are bleak. Therefore, the auction time has been prolonged. At the same time, the government is cracking down on speculation very hard and has shortened the standard yarn and cotton period from six months to four months. According to market rumors, shortening the period is deeply feared that the number of rounds will increase. Originally, there were four rounds of auctions in the morning and the same in the afternoon for each month, or it may be changed to five or six rounds of auctions. In addition, the security deposit for cotton yarn was originally 800 yuan per hundred pieces, and 300 yuan per hundred dan of cotton. Starting from the 16th of this month, the security deposit for cotton yarn will be increased to 1,000 yuan, and the security deposit for cotton will be increased to 400 yuan.</p>
<p>Weekly Refund of Special Certificates - The China Merchants Yarn and Cloth Exchange will cancel the special security deposits for the December, January, February, and March cotton yarn starting from the 16th of this month. All special certificates and security deposits that have been paid will be refunded on this day. The November cotton yarn will still be collected at 16 yuan per bale, and the November cotton will still be collected at 6 yuan per dan.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Securities: Bullish Sentiment Seems to Be Emerging; Government Bonds Suddenly Rebound <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange saw a sudden rebound in market conditions. However, even though the Suiyuan-Qinghai war has begun and the situation on the Shanxi border is critical, the bulls still exerted their remaining strength to maintain the market, and thus were fortunate enough to avoid a downward trend. However, some bulls took profits and closed their positions, while others were still struggling. Given the current high market prices, future opposition is bound to be quite intense, and the overall situation is difficult to be optimistic about. Looking back at yesterday's trading, at the opening in the morning, bulls in issues such as Nos. 4, 5, and 10 emerged, and there were also many exits from No. 34 (Shanxi issue). Nos. 23 and 47 still saw buying interest. Therefore, the initial price of the current month's Series E bonds was raised by three jiao. However, ultimately, due to strong selling pressure and supply exceeding demand, the bulls were temporarily unable to maintain the market, and the situation suddenly deteriorated, falling by two and a half to seven and a half jiao. In the second session, Nos. 4, 5, and 11 saw further selling, and No. 22 also saw exits, with prices falling by three to six and a half jiao. Later, selling became slightly less active, and the bulls seized the opportunity to push prices up. There was significant buying in Nos. 6 to 6, so prices in the later session rose by three to four jiao again. However, the upward momentum had already weakened. At the opening in the afternoon, the earlier issues resumed their upward trend, and retail investors and No. 32 were seen entering the market again, with Series E bonds rising by three and a half jiao. However, the later issues still lacked momentum, and prices fluctuated up and down. Series A bonds fell slightly by one jiao. The market stabilized by the close, and trading was thin, with price differences ranging from nine fen to one jiao. The final market results showed that Series E and D bonds rose by one and a half to three and a half jiao, while the rest only recovered by a small amount, ranging from five fen to one jiao to three and a half jiao. The total trading volume was 18.11 million yuan. The results of the price increases and decreases are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<h3 id="e181">American New Cotton Has a Saying About Stopping Management Plans <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Cotton Speculators Sell Off En Masse</p>
<p>Yesterday, the opening of American cotton futures saw declines of five "bangs" (a unit of weight) to gains of one "bang." Early in the morning, both domestic and foreign long positions were largely liquidated, and cotton farmers engaged in hedging sales, causing a slight drop in market prices. Subsequently, traders and sellers bought in around 11.5 cents, leading to a slight rebound. There was uncertainty in the market, but demand for white cotton remained active, and the domestic situation was strong. Unfortunately, there was no progress abroad, and competition from foreign cotton was also intense. Later, January futures saw limited price buying, and December futures were also driven higher. H. Hester estimated that mill usage this week was 412,000 bales, and Liverpool stocks were 294,000 bales. Before closing, traders bought in, and market conditions turned firm, while hedging sales also increased. Spot prices rose by 5 "bangs," and futures were unchanged to up 9 "bangs." English cotton spot prices fell by 2 points, and futures fell by 3 to 5 points. Indian cotton weakened due to rumors of a halt to the new cotton management plan for American cotton, with speculators and long-time bulls selling off. Flat Goul fell 0.25 to 0.5 rupees, Oomra fell 1.75 to 2.5 rupees, and White Raw Creek fell 1 rupee. The original telegram is to the left. (Dated 13th)</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to a Bombay telegram, the opening forecast for the 14th was White Raw Creek at 116 rupees, up 0.25 rupees; Oomra at 196 rupees, unchanged; and Flat Goul at 157 rupees, unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Three Types of Yarn and Cotton Rise in Unison <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Osaka telegram of the 14th: Three types of yarn futures rose by 1.10 to 3.40 yuan, with near-term contracts at 235.80 yuan and far-term contracts at 211.40 yuan. Cotton futures rose by 0.25 to 0.50 yuan, with near-term contracts at 65.30 yuan and far-term contracts at 65.90 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Finished Cloth and Flannelette Retail Sales Are Particularly Good <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>However, Resale Market for Hand Goods Slips Slightly</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cloth market was agitated by news of estimated cotton production reductions domestically, and market sentiment was tense, with prices trending upward. The Qingdao cotton market for the three types of goods was also favorable. Although current cotton cloth sales were very slow, market momentum remained firm. White shirt flannelette, white twill flannelette, colored plush flannelette, and printed flannelette were selling particularly well in retail shops along the main street. The goods were in short supply. However, due to factories needing to meet deadlines for previously ordered low-priced goods, deliveries increased, causing the resale of hand goods to become inconsistent. Prices generally fell by 0.20 to 0.30 yuan per bolt, depending on the urgency of demand. Tribute cloth, with fewer shipments, commanded higher prices. Serges and broadcloth sales were moderate, and prices were firm due to stable yarn prices. The supply of deeply discounted cotton cloth was already prepared far in advance, but recent transportation issues in the interior have led to sluggish sales and little demand. White goods, coarse cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill are all showing weak demand in the main street. Due to shallow waters, provinces like Hunan and Hubei are trying to ship goods as quickly as possible, and all goods are showing some demand, but only for spot goods. Reports from the Yunnan-Southwest route have been quiet for many days but have now shown some improvement, with shipments mainly consisting of blue cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Crowding Soars by a Yuan <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>With the approach of early winter, there is continued brisk sales of broadcloth and overcoat materials. Retail sales are strong in the Da Xin Street area of the city. The spot wholesale of herringbone, chocolate drill, riding breeches cloth, and crow tops, etc., have seen large volumes traded daily among traders. Among these, crow tops are selling the best. Horse brand cloth has been popular for overcoats for eight or nine years, and chocolate drill has been popular for three or four years. Crow tops were only newly popular last year, and the tendency of customers to prefer the new over the old is inevitable. Sales are currently strong, and imports from both the East and West are significantly lower compared to riding breeches cloth and chocolate drill. Domestic production only includes riding breeches cloth, with no chocolate drill or crow tops. As a result, there is a shortage and prices are soaring. Yesterday, the market saw a sudden jump of more than half a yuan. Western crow tops that sold for 7.70 yuan last week are now being sold for 8.50 yuan by traders. Eastern crow tops that sold for 6.75 yuan yesterday must now be sold for 7.75 yuan, and stocks are extremely low.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Finance: Swap Spread Not Large; Call Money Covers Shorts Actively <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Although the gold market rose yesterday, buying interest was not strong. Fortunately, the swap spread was very small, and large short positions were actively covered, resulting in a slight increase. The trend is still flat. Early in the morning, overseas silver markets saw England rising and America flat. Traders believed that both buyers and sellers were satisfied after closing, and the market was therefore evenly balanced. Monteree forward silver prices rose by 5 hao to 2.5 li. Exchange rates all rose. London raw gold rose by 1.5 pence. The central bank's listing announcement showed both England and America flat. The customs gold unit rose by 3 li. The standard gold bar price listing rose to 1159.80 yuan. Pre-market trading outside the exchange opened around 54 yuan. Tong Taichang once sold at 3.5 yuan. Hengchang Yong slightly absorbed at lower prices. The morning opening was slightly higher. After the opening, various parties sold slightly, causing prices to fall slightly. However, shorts, aware of the small swap spread, covered their positions, gradually pulling prices up. HSBC's listing announcement showed both England and America flat, and the silver balance tax rose by 1 fen. At this time, large customers were seeking supply, but because most were limited orders, and various firms were focusing on the swap spread, the market was even flatter, with very little movement. The same was true at noon. This swap saw shorts paying 1.90 to 2.50 yuan. After noting the market situation for the first half of the day,</p>
<p>The morning opening was 1153.60 yuan, a slight increase of 0.10 yuan compared to the previous close. Tong Chachang and Fu'an unwound, falling to 3.40 yuan. Chengda, Zhengchang, Fuyu, Dadecheng, and Laijin rose to 3.80 yuan. Qiafeng, Yongwanxing, Tong Taichang, Hengyu, Tongfeng, and Henglai sold, falling again to 3.5 yuan. Dadecheng, Chunyuan, Yongfuxing, and Yongshengyuan absorbed at lower prices. HSBC's listing announcement showed both England and America flat, rising back to 3.80 yuan. Fuxing and Yongshunli, etc., sold off. The silver balance tax rose by 1 fen, gradually declining. The noon close was 1153.60 yuan.</p>
<p>The closing price, based on the central bank's listed standard gold bar price, rose to 1159.80 yuan, effectively pressing down over 6 yuan compared to the closing price. December bars were all priced at 1154 yuan. This month's book entry was 1151 yuan, December 1154 yuan, morning water top-up 1151 yuan. Refined gold was priced up 6 yuan to 1159.60 yuan. The spot market remained stable. Tianjin goods were priced up 13.5 yuan. Refined gold buying price was 10 yuan, all transacted. Selling price was priced up 14.5 yuan, with Dafengheng selling over 100 taels.</p>
<p>Trading within the exchange was generally flat. In summary, Yuanmao Yong, Dadecheng, Chengda, Shengyuan, Yonghengchang, Yongzhengchang, and Chunyuan Yong were on the buying side, while Qiafeng Yong, Tong Taichang, Shenda Yong, Tongfeng Heng, and Wanxing, etc., were on the selling side.</p>
<p>This December swap to January saw shorts initially bidding 2.50 to 3 yuan outside the exchange, but there were no transactions. Qingfayong, etc., then bid, falling back to around 2.50 yuan. Qingfayong, Shengyuan Yong, Dafengheng, Jingfu Qianchang Xiang, and Chunyuan Yong actively bid, but Hengyu and Dachangxiang, etc., although bidding, gradually fell to within 2 yuan. Yuanmao Yong bid for 70 bars from Shengyuan Yong at only 1.90 yuan. Wuchangxiang, Qiafeng Yong, Fuxing Yong, Hengyu, and Yuanmao Yong then bid. When the official opening began at 10 o'clock, longs bid 2 yuan. After opening, although Dadecheng and Qiafeng Yong bid, Wuchangxiang, Yuanmao Yong, Yuanting, and Dachangxiang actively bid, rising to 2.30 to 2.40 yuan. Dadecheng and Shengyuan Yong settled to bid, falling to 2 yuan. Yuanmao Yong, etc., bid. The noon close saw longs bidding 2.10 yuan. Large long positions were unchanged, and the closing price was still pressed. The future may be even flatter.</p>
<p>Checking, the market situation for half a day was calm. The morning opening was 1153.60 yuan, and the noon close was 1153.60 yuan. The highest price was 1153.80 yuan, and the lowest price was 1153.40 yuan, with only 0.40 yuan of fluctuation. The total volume traded for half a day was 7,420 bars.</p>
<p>Among those with outstanding December bars, longs included Qiafeng Yong with over 1,400, Shengyuan Yong with less than 500, Dachangxiang with over 400, Qingfa with over 100, Futai Heng, Yisheng Yongheng, and Fuda each with over 100.

<p>The exchange market yesterday saw continued congestion among Chinese merchants, with banks striving to stabilize the situation. The process finally stabilized. Early in the morning, overseas telegrams reported that London large bars were up 1.875 both near and far, with traders saying that the market stabilized after closing because both buyers and sellers were satisfied. New York silver markets were unchanged. Monteree forward silver prices rose by 9 tai to 2.5 li. London raw gold rose by 1.5 pence. England against America rose by 0.375, England against France rose by 3 pounds, America against England rose by 0.4375, and America against France rose by 0.25. The central bank's listing announcement showed both England and America flat. The customs order unit rose by 3 li. The morning opening of the exchange market saw recent selling prices of English exchange at 1 shilling 2.5625 pence, and American exchange at 29.625 yuan, which was flat for both England and America compared to the previous close, but the American dollar was slightly looser. After the opening, banks actively settled their positions. Although Chinese merchants continued to settle American exchange, HSBC's listing announcement showed both England and America flat, but the market was still tense. Later, the silver balance tax announcement rose by 1 fen, and banks still actively stabilized the market, which began to loosen slightly. The noon close saw recent selling prices of English exchange at 1 shilling 2.5625 pence, and American exchange at 29.625 yuan, which was flat for both England and America compared to the previous close. The forward market was the same. Chinese merchants slightly sold over 100,000 yuan of shillings and American dollars. Now, the recorded transactions are as follows:</p>
<p>English Exchange: The morning opening saw a recent selling price of 1 shilling 2.5625 pence. Mai Jia Li bought, December 2.5625. HSBC took spot goods at 2.59375.

<p>Yesterday's flour market initially rose, then fell, forming a consolidation pattern. Overseas wheat reports from Chicago and Canada were up 0.10 to 0.20 yuan, with Liverpool up 1/8. Market sentiment, based on stable overseas wheat prices and the lingering effects of the previous day, saw gradual and smooth buying interest after the morning opening, with different months up by about 0.02 yuan. However, in the afternoon, factories collected near and hedged far, causing far-term prices to initially decline. With current levels already high, outside speculators did not expect further gains and wanted to exit. Therefore, the closing situation turned weak. The overall result for the day was a gain of about 0.005 yuan for the near term and a loss of 0.075 yuan for the far term, forming a situation of near-term strength and far-term weakness.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Wheat Futures' Rising Trend Remains Strong <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market saw a slight increase in overseas wheat reports after the morning opening, and market sentiment initially stabilized. As there were not many days left in the current month, newly emerging long positions were no longer concerned. Therefore, the near-term market was initially quite calm. When new outside demand in January appeared, the market immediately rose 0.03 to 0.04 yuan, and far-term months also showed renewed vigor, rising 0.07 to 0.08 yuan. Then, as the flour market turned weak, and with many floating profits, slight liquidation occurred, and market momentum calmed slightly. The result was a gain of 0.02 yuan for the current month and gains of 0.06 to 0.09 yuan for other months. The overall rising trend for the day remained strong. The current wheat market also showed tightness. The entire city saw Shen Da bringing in 2,500 bags of Yaowan Suqian wheat at a price of 6 yuan. The other factories saw no transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e189">New Japonica Rice Turns Stable, Yuan Rice Drops Slightly <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were over fifty suppliers from various provinces, with a total of 11,600 to 11,700 shi (a unit of dry measure). Sales along the main street slightly improved, but the destination of packaged rice was worse than before due to shipping issues. A total of over 5,000 bags of thin indica rice were sold. As a result, the market situation was strong. Thick japonica high grade rose by 0.10 to 0.15 yuan, while medium grade rose by several fen. Thin indica also only rose by 0.05 yuan. Duyang sharp and japonica rice prices rose by several fen. Yinbian yuan was unchanged.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were over thirty suppliers from the Hexia area. Sales of various goods in the market were flat. New japonica rice was slightly available in the early market. Sellers insisted on prices in the afternoon market, and prices were firm. Yangdu Buke sharp, etc., prices were also tight. Yin yuan was low in stock and prices were flat. Bianyuan saw little delivery for liquor households, and prices were down by 0.10 yuan. Thin indica rice prices were down by 0.03 to 0.05 yuan. Early indica rice was neither good nor bad.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Customer Xian Rice Rises Slightly <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, both the arrival and sales of customer xian rice were active, and the market remained firm. Sales were still mainly to the Guangdong area and the main street. The Henan area also continued to handle machine rice. Given the recent limited arrivals and the lively customer market, there was a need for a gradual increase in the market. However, with remaining stocks still high, some owners were unwilling to give in, so the increase was still slight. After several days of active customer demand, there has been no large increase. Yesterday, only brown rice and some machine rice rose by 0.03 to 0.05 yuan to 0.10 yuan. A total of 3,200 bags of Jiangxi rice, 7,155 bags of Hunan rice, 1,000 bags of Han brown rice, and 800 bags of Yongyuan were sold throughout the day.</p>

<p>Yesterday's tea market saw mixed trading activity. Sales of coarse black tea from Hubei, Wenzhou, Ningzhou, and other areas to England suddenly became brisk. Jardine Matheson and other foreign firms were actively sourcing large quantities. Tong Taixiang and Zhengyuan tea firms sold over 800 dan (a unit of weight), with market prices ranging from 18 to 20 yuan. As for the green tea market, only Xiehe and Tongfu firms bought over 200 boxes of Zhenmei, and prices remained flat.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Tea Warehouse Association reported that this week's tea market was relatively quiet due to the Autumn Equinox horse trade period, followed by Sun Yat-sen's birthday and other holidays. However, various firms, seeing that tea stocks were not high, were actively contacting foreign buyers via telegram, but the offered prices were too low and did not match market conditions. Most transactions involved low-grade goods, such as Pingshui Yatou Zhucha grade 5 and 6, local Zhenmei, and Xiaozhen Kui. The association noted that the on-hand stocks of these low-grade goods have already been sold out.</p>

<p>— Implication</p>
<p>Dear children, your teachers always tell you that a person should not only have good academic performance but also good conduct. Now, let's not talk about academic performance, but conduct. What is conduct? Conduct can be said to be all of a person's behavior. Good conduct can be said to be all good behavior. What kind of behavior is considered good? It is easy to give a definition. We can say that good conduct should be honesty, humility, politeness, and open-mindedness.</p>
<p>What is honesty? Honesty is not deceiving oneself or others. What is humility? Humility is being respectful and polite to others. What is politeness? Politeness is behavior that does not violate rules. What is open-mindedness? Open-mindedness is not being arrogant or conceited.</p>
<p>I have a relative who, after graduating from elementary school, joined a company to learn the trade. In the blink of an eye, his three-year term expired, and he could manage some monetary affairs. However, tempted by his friends, he embezzled company funds. When the matter was discovered, he was fired. He was unable to advance because of his dishonesty. In other words, he was unable to advance because of his poor conduct.</p>
<p>Dear children, academic performance is important, but conduct is also important. The ancients always advised people to "teach conduct and encourage learning," which is indeed correct.</p>

<p>This time, I brought over thirty children to Nanjing to participate in the National Boy Scout Grand Review. On the first day we arrived in Nanjing, after reporting to headquarters, we began to set up camp at the designated location. It took us most of the day to set up the campsite. We were very happy because tomorrow was the day for people to visit.</p>
<p>The next day, many more people came to visit the camp. Around 2:00 PM, seven young boys wearing Boy Scout uniforms came to visit our camp. After they introduced themselves, we learned that the little boy wearing the black neckerchief was from Jilin, and the other six were from Hebei. They came to Nanjing specifically for the Grand Review. Our thirty-plus children here asked me to urge him to tell us some news from outside the pass.</p>
<p>He said: "My home is in Dunhua, Jilin. After the "Manchukuo" flag was hung on top of our school's flagpole, things changed drastically. Our textbooks also changed, and every school had several foreign teachers. The first lesson in the geography textbook was the borders of "Manchukuo"; the first lesson in the language textbook was the national flag song (referring to the national flag of the puppet state of Manchukuo). Every morning, those teachers came to teach us foreign languages. Usually, the teachers told us that there were many bandits inside the pass, and that everyone was addicted to opium. Only after we came inside the pass did we realize that these words were all lies meant to deceive us.</p>
<p>Studying there was extremely painful. I remember once, a foreign student in our class had a conflict with the class leader for some reason. He reported it to their teacher, and the teacher beat the class leader until he was bruised and bleeding. When the students saw this, who didn't hate it with every fiber of their being? But they all dared to be angry but dared not speak out. My father has always been a businessman outside the pass. Last July, he sent me to my aunt's house in Beiping. I am now studying at the Hebei County Elementary School. This time, coming to Nanjing and seeing the brothers and sisters from all over the country, I am very excited, but every time I think of my school back home, and the many classmates I haven't seen in a long time, I wonder how much injustice they are suffering now?"</p>
<p>He told us this so eloquently that we were all in tears. Because it was getting late, he said goodbye and went back to his camp.</p>
<p>Children, you have all read what this little brother told us, haven't you? Everyone, think about it: what methods can we use to save our brothers and sisters who are in dire straits?</p>

<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>I very much hope that China will have such a day:</p>
<p>On a certain day's newspaper, a message is suddenly discovered, printed in large characters, saying that a team of children, all under the age of sixteen, purchased a motorboat three months ago. This motorboat is intended for exploration. Therefore, it is named the "Children's Exploration." All equipment is resistant to huge waves and ice floes. After they had everything ready, they cast off and set sail. Although they are not the world's famous scientists, they all have sufficient scientific knowledge. So driving and radio transmission and reception, etc., are all done by themselves. Since departure, there has been very little news, so there have been repeated rumors that these children have sacrificed in their cause. But last night, this newspaper received a radio report from the "Children's Exploration," stating that "The expedition has already discovered a new continent in the Pacific Ocean, with a very large area that is difficult to estimate at this time. The inhabitants are all aborigines, with very few in number and a simple life. The island is full of metal and oil mines. The team has now raised the national flag and gained sovereignty. It is hoped that the government will quickly send a navy and an aircraft surveying team to work there."</p>
<p>On a certain day's newspaper, a message is suddenly discovered, printed in large characters, saying that in a certain village in its province, there is a fifteen-year-old child named ×××, who was very poor, but he loved to read very much, and even more so to conduct all kinds of modern scientific experiments. When he was eight years old, he already had an ideal of seeking human food from natural substances. For several years, all the income he earned from working for others was completely consumed in his simple and exquisite laboratory. His parents repeatedly obstructed his scientific research, and his neighbors and friends ridiculed his foolishness, but he still persevered in his research. However, countless failures sometimes forced him to cry sadly to himself on quiet nights, but he did not lose heart and continued to work hard. Recently, his research was successful. He discovered a substance in ordinary air that the scientific community has not yet discovered. It can be artificially manufactured into a powdery solid. One millimeter of this powdery solid can replace the nutrients contained in one pound of bread, half a pound of beef, and one pound of milk. It is a very good substitute for food. Even Japanese and foreign reporters and scientists have come to visit and believe that this invention is a great revolution for contemporary politics and economics, benefiting people infinitely. And this year's Nobel Prize in Science will undoubtedly be awarded to this little scientist.</p>
<p>I hope that our Chinese children will have such a day. And at the same time, I believe that our country's talented children will have one day turn my hope into a reality.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Voice <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— True</p>
<p>One Sunday morning, Min'er and his older brother Ting'er were doing some physical exercises in their garden. The weather was very sunny and clear that day, and the little birds on the branches were chirping. He thought the sound was very pleasant; how could he hear it? He had never doubted this question before. This was a definite reality; what was there to doubt? But now, the more he thought about it, the more questions he had. Once he had a question, he had to solve it, so he had to ask his brother:</p>
<p>"Brother, the singing of the little birds sounds so nice, how can we hear it?"</p>
<p>"If you want to know how to hear the singing of the little birds, you must first know how the little birds make sounds. I say that the sound of the little birds is the vibration of the vocal cords in their throats. It can be seen that the sound is generated by the vibration of an object. How can you know this? I can try to show you." He went to get a pipa, and plucked one of its strings with his finger. The string vibrated quickly and made a clanging sound. Then, he touched the string with his finger, and the vibration of the string stopped immediately, and the sound disappeared as well. He said, "From this, we can know. As for how we can hear the chirping of the little birds? When the little birds are chirping, the surrounding air also vibrates, becoming sparse and dense alternately. This kind of sparse and dense vibration can gradually spread up and down, left and right, and forward and backward, like ripples in water. This is the wave of sound, so it is called a sound wave. When this sound wave reaches our ears and vibrates our eardrums, we feel the sound."</p>
<p>"Brother, why are some sounds loud? Why are some sounds soft? Why are some sounds resonant? What are the differences?"</p>
<p>"The difference between loud and soft sounds is difficult to understand. It is easier to understand if you separate the strength and pitch of the sounds. If the string is plucked harder, the distance of vibration is greater, and the sound is stronger; if the string is plucked lighter, the distance of vibration is smaller, and the sound is weaker. Thus, it can be seen that the strength of the sound is directly proportional to the size of the vibration distance of the sound-producing body. If the string is shorter, thinner, and tighter, the vibration will be faster, and the sound will be higher; if the string is longer, thicker, and looser, the vibration will be slower, and the sound will be lower. It can be seen that the pitch of the sound is due to the speed of vibration of the sound-producing body, that is, due to the number of vibrations. The loudness of the sound is what I call strength, and the sharpness or resonance of the sound is pitch."</p>
<p>"Brother, then why are some sounds pleasant to hear, like the sound of music, and some sounds unpleasant to hear, like crying? What is the reason for this?"</p>
<p>"When a string vibrates regularly, the surrounding air becomes continuously sparse and dense, forming alternating sparse and dense sounds. If the vibration of the string is very regular, the sound produced will naturally be very regular, and we will find it pleasant to hear, so we call it musical sound. The vibration caused by the sound of crying is irregular, so we find it unpleasant to hear, so we call it noise."</p>
<h3 id="e197">Tuberculosis Statistics <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Tao</p>
<p>The mortality rate from tuberculosis in China is higher than in any other country, because this germ is most easily transmitted. It is not necessary to have contact with a patient; it can be transmitted unknowingly even in the air. Therefore, the more patients there are, the more opportunities there are to infect others. In the early stage of the disease, it is not easy to detect, but once it is discovered, it is said to have reached the second or third stage. Only then is there a last-minute effort to seek medical treatment, but it is already too late. At the same time, the poverty of the national economy is also a major cause of tuberculosis. Those who are struggling on the line of death, even if they know that they have unfortunately contracted tuberculosis, how can they have the financial means to treat it? Therefore, the tubercle bacillus in China is spreading and expanding day by day, and seems to have formed an inextricable bond with the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Recently, I saw in the newspaper a shocking tuberculosis statistic!</p>
<p>When a certain hospital in this city was conducting an anti-tuberculosis X-ray examination, among the young students who went to the hospital for examination in September, a total of 428 people were examined, of whom 86 had had tuberculosis, 8 had been cured, and 17 were in the early stage of the disease. The total number of patients accounted for about 24 percent. That is, on average, one in every four people is sick. Every child must be chilled to the bone when they see this terrible statistic!</p>
<p>There are many ways to prevent tuberculosis, but the simplest and easiest way is to pay attention to the following items: (1) Pay attention to personal and public hygiene, and promote the implementation of hygiene knowledge among children; (2) Promote physical education and forge a body that is as strong as steel. In this way, the tubercle bacillus will simply be discouraged and unable to invade at all. Only in this way can one's life, which should live to a certain age, not be cut short and not enter the path of "unjust death"!</p>

<h3 id="e199">Compass <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Ziding</p>
<p>Little friends: You have probably all heard the name compass, right? You probably all know its use too. Here, let me talk about its structure and principle, okay?</p>
<p>Before talking about its structure and principle, we might as well first know its inventor. To put it simply, it was 4,000 years ago, during the time of the Yellow Emperor (Yellow Emperor was his name, his surname was Gongsun). There was a tyrannical prince (Chi You) who rebelled, and the Yellow Emperor sent troops to fight him, but unfortunately, when the Yellow Emperor sent troops, it happened to be foggy for several days, and the Yellow Emperor's soldiers all got lost, so they were defeated.</p>
<p>Soon, the Yellow Emperor invented the south-pointing chariot, which could find directions in the fog. He gave this south-pointing chariot to the soldiers to use, and as a result, he was victorious.</p>
<p>Since the Yellow Emperor invented the south-pointing chariot, later people improved it into the compass. Its structure is very simple. It uses a round plate, with the four characters for east, south, west, and north written on the four corners of the plate. In the center, there is a small column, and a magnetic needle is placed on the top of the column. A piece of glass is placed on the top of the plate, and there is a handle on the right. This is all there is to it.</p>
<p>Now, let's put aside the other unimportant things and just talk about this magnetic needle, because the compass can point south entirely because of this magnetic needle.</p>
<p>What is a magnetic needle? It is a needle containing magnetism. What is magnetism? This is a natural phenomenon, unique to magnetite, which can attract iron parts (iron nails, iron wires, etc.). You have probably all seen magnets, right? If we take a small knife and rub it on it a few times, then this small knife can also attract iron, right? The magnetic needle in the compass is also made using this method. Its two ends are called two poles, one end is the south pole, and the other end is the north pole.</p>
<p>Then how does it always point south? Aren't you curious, little friends? This is very simple. It turns out that the Earth is also a piece of magnet, and it also has north and south poles. The south pole of the compass is attracted by the north pole of the Earth, and the north pole of the compass is attracted by the south pole of the Earth. This is the principle of "opposites attract, and likes repel," so the compass always points south.</p>
<p>The four characters east, south, west, and north in the compass are called the four directions. If you want to make it easier to estimate directions, you can change it to eight or sixteen directions. (The same as eight directions, as above)</p>
<h3 id="e200">The Cricket is Chirping <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Rongyu</p>
<p>The Moon Sister wears a round face, showing a cool smile, secretly peeking at the windows of each household. At this time, every child is seduced by her, opening their eyes wide, and refusing to go to the land of dreams for a while. He looks at the window shadow outside the window, reflected on the glass window, and it is actually an excellent sketch. He also hears the weaving maiden hiding in the bushes of the melon trellis. She keeps calling out "Ou! Za!" He can't wait to jump out of bed and take a look under the moon pavilion.</p>
<p>"Qu! Qu! Qu!" Another tempting sound comes from under the steps, and is transmitted very clearly to the pillow. Min'er knows that this is the chirping of the cricket, and associates it with all kinds of things about crickets. He thinks of his neighbor Daxie, who has a strong cricket, and always wins every battle he fights. He also thinks of the cricket's teeth, which are as sharp as weaving pliers; the strength of his legs is just like the driver of a person who is used to running; and the triumphant chirping is as loud as a battle horn. He is lost in thought, and a huge cricket appears before his eyes, as big as a grasshopper. He is still afraid, but the cricket gets bigger and bigger according to his wishes, becoming as big as a cicada in a moment, as big as a frog, as big as a cat, and as big as a dog. Min'er is overjoyed. He thinks that with this cricket, not to mention that Daxie's ever-victorious army next door can't stand half a bite from it, even if all the crickets in the world are gathered together to fight it, it wouldn't care! Min'er also hurriedly follows it. Once in the garden, the big cricket chirps a few times, just like a general giving orders, and thousands of small crickets suddenly emerge from the grass, divided into two teams, glaring and preparing to fight. Another command is given, and the two sides start fighting, with their teeth clenched, their legs kicking, and they fight so excitedly that their bellies are turned to the sky, and they turn over and continue to fight. Once, twice, ... dozens of times, ... hundreds of times, and then gradually the victory or defeat is separated. The defeated side has its abdomen broken and its intestines flowing, and dies stiffly on the ground; even the victorious side has its whiskers broken, its teeth missing, and its legs lame, making moaning sounds. Min'er looks at this situation and feels uncomfortable in his heart, muttering: "They are all our own people, why are they fighting so miserably?" Suddenly, the scene in front of him changes, and the garden becomes a battlefield, and many dead and wounded crickets turn into the wronged souls of dead soldiers. They say in unison: "We don't want to be provoked by others to do such things, we don't want to be puppets fighting our own people, we should unite together to kill the people who provoke the war." While saying this, they point at Min'er and say: "This is our enemy, but he provoked us to fight." As soon as they finish speaking, these many wronged souls, some carrying their severed heads, some with their legs half-broken, some with their bloody intestines flowing, roar and rush towards Min'er, threatening Min'er to pay for their lives. Min'er is taken aback. He wants to turn around and run away, but it is too late. With a cry of "Ah yo," he is covered in cold sweat. He looks and is still in bed, it turns out to be a nightmare.</p>
<p>At this time, Min'er looks at the moonlight outside the window, which is a little hazy; the cricket under the steps is still chirping.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Little Toy Gun <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Zhigang</p>
<p>This is a very interesting game: It's very simple, every child can make one himself, and it will definitely be very fun to play with. Now I'll tell you how:</p>
<p>(Tools) One goose feather tube. One thin bamboo stick (about three or four inches long). One piece of sweet potato or similar.</p>
<p>(Method) First cut off the lower section of the goose feather tube (the empty section). Then shave the bamboo stick so that it is slightly smaller than the goose feather tube. Also shave the sweet potato (other melons can also be used) to be about two minutes thick. After these are made, you can start playing! Insert the goose feather tube into the sweet potato, then insert the other end to the bottom, pick it up, and push the bamboo stick into the larger end of the goose feather tube. Then the sweet potato in the goose feather tube will "whoosh" and shoot forward, and can shoot up to two or three zhang away, almost like a toy gun. (See picture)</p>
<p>(Principle) This game completely utilizes the principle of air pressure. Because when you push the bamboo stick into the goose feather tube, the air inside the goose feather tube is compressed very heavily, so it will shoot the sweet potato at the other end outwards!</p>

<p>— Hai</p>
<p>One day, Bois-Corfield was traveling a long distance, not far from a place called Camoggie, when he unfortunately encountered a very violent storm. He hurriedly went forward, hoping to reach the nearest house to take shelter for a while. Unexpectedly, a tree was blown down and lay right in front of him. He thought it would be safer to hide in these dense branches and leaves, at least he would not be blown by the strong wind. When the storm subsided, it was already late. He dared not grope in the dark, so he stayed there, not moving at all. Rainwater dripped from the branches, soaking his clothes. After dawn, he walked back to the road and met a farmer driving a cart, who allowed him to ride in the cart. At eight o'clock he arrived at a village, and the farmer let him off. As soon as he got out of the cart, he fell to the ground. His clothes were not only soaked, but also covered in mud. He was cold, hungry, and exhausted. He looked at the cleanliness of the houses around him, which made him even more surprised, and he dared not approach. However, driven by hunger and cold, he finally mustered up the courage to walk to an open window, where he saw a woman peeling beans. He begged her to let him rest for a while and dry his clothes, but the woman gave him a contemptuous look and told him to leave immediately. He went to another house to beg, and received the same treatment. Then he sat down at the door of a house, but the mistress of the house immediately drove him away, saying that they could not allow thieves and vagrants.</p>
<p>Bois-Corfield thought to himself: No matter what, they wouldn't drive me out if I went to church, would they? But he found the church, only to see that the door was tightly locked. He had no choice but to sit down on the steps to rest for a while. The children in the village gathered around him, surrounding him and shouting at him, calling him a thief and a runaway. He stayed there for two full hours, preparing to freeze to death or starve to death. But he was still praying silently in his heart for God to give him the courage to endure this difficult time.</p>
<p>Finally, a more charitable woman walked up from among the children and spoke to him very kindly. Bois-Corfield told her about his experience of sleeping in the forest in the rain last night. Then the village chief came to check his passport, and found that everything was consistent with his identity. The charitable woman volunteered to take him back with her, but when he stood up, he felt that his limbs were frozen and he could not move. His heels were swollen and he had lost one of his shoes. Sleeping in the wind and rain last night had really caused him great pain. The people in the village also became kind at this time, and brought a cart, carrying Bois-Corfield to go with the good woman. He stayed there for a few days and gradually recovered, seeing that he could travel again. One of the villagers gave him a pair of boots. From then on, he often rested for one or two days, depending on his physical strength, the weather, and the hospitality of the people. Whenever people kept him for a short stay, he often did some small tasks such as sweeping, washing clothes, or sewing to repay them. He felt that it would be wiser not to tell people about his quest to seek forgiveness from his godfather at first, because if he told people, they would think he was a scammer. So he started by just asking people for some food. If the other person was sincere and kind, he would further tell them about his fatigue along the way and beg them to allow him to rest for the night. If the people allowed him to stay, and they talked well with each other, then he would tell them his story from beginning to end.</p>

<p>Celebrity Interview</p>
<h3 id="e203">Uchiyama Bookstore Owner, Kanzo Uchiyama <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Xinqin</p>
<p>Before his death, Mr. Lu Xun would often spend his days idly sitting in the Uchiyama Bookstore. This has become common knowledge. Therefore, in the last ten years or so, the Uchiyama Bookstore and its founder, Mr. Kanzo Uchiyama, have been deeply imprinted in people's minds along with the name "Lu Xun." To learn a little about what happened after Mr. Lu Xun's death, and with the intention of meeting Mr. Uchiyama, I arrived at the park shooting range one evening as dusk was settling. After entering the bookstore and asking, I learned that Mr. Uchiyama was out for dinner. A Chinese staff member politely invited me to sit down and wait, and also asked me why I wanted to see him. After I explained that I admired him and was paying a visit, the staff member pointed to a book on the bookshelf titled "A Japanese Person's View of China" and said that it was Mr. Uchiyama's recent work. I saw that there was also an Enlightenment Press Chinese version translated by Mr. Yun Bingqi, and I took the opportunity to pick it up and read it. The first thing I saw was Mr. Lu Xun's preface. In the preface, there were the following introductory remarks: "The author (referring to Mr. Uchiyama) has lived in China for over twenty years, traveled to various places, and come into contact with people from all walks of life. Therefore, I believe he is a suitable person to write such essays. Facts speak louder than words. Do these essays not indeed radiate a unique brilliance? I myself often go to listen to his talks, and in fact have the right and obligation to support the venue. However, because we have been "old friends" for a long time, I would also like to add a few critical words here. First, there is a tendency to overstate the advantages of China, which is contrary to my opinion... Another point... is that reading these essays often makes one feel "so that's how it is." (Omitted below) The author's intention is still to introduce a part of the truth about China to Japanese readers. However, in the present situation, the result will still vary depending on the different readers. This is something that cannot be helped." Finally, I turned to the author's essay "Literary Culture and Life Culture," which served as an introduction. The conclusion was: "Japanese scholars of China have only studied Chinese literature and essays built upon literature. I, however, pay attention to life and want to grasp the culture of life." I also turned to his essay "Convenience Tea," where he said: "I also imitate the Chinese and distribute convenience tea on the streets every year. (Omitted) No matter how fierce the anti-Japanese sentiment, there is no one who does not drink the tea. When one is extremely thirsty, as long as you give them what they want to drink, there is no issue of different nationalities or racial differences. Isn't the reason for rejection and non-use because one has given them something they do not want or are afraid of? What if you give a very thirsty person sticky mud? Someone who asks such a question lacks human understanding." Just as I was about to continue reading, I heard a burst of laughter coming from outside the door. Then, the staff member called out to me, "Mr. Uchiyama is here." He didn't introduce us, but I recognized him because I had been there with Mr. Ya Chen and had seen him before. I walked over to him. As soon as he entered the store, he didn't look elsewhere, but went straight to the back of the bookshelf, which was piled up like a screen, where there were two writing desks (also like accounting desks) and several bamboo chairs lined up (according to Mr. Uchiyama, this was where he, Mr. Lu Xun, and their friends often gathered for casual talks). Although the weather was only cool and not cold, there was already a fire pot burning in the space surrounding the chairs. Mr. Uchiyama was bald, wearing only a woolen sweater on his upper body and a pair of Western-style trousers on his lower body, and he sat down with a smile. I went over to him and introduced myself. He looked at me as if he recognized me, and I then explained my purpose. He laughed again and said, "Excellent, excellent!" After saying this, he looked at me kindly, as if preparing to answer all my questions. I thought for a moment and said, "I have only read a little of your book "View of China," but I already admire it very much. If I read it all, I don't know how much it will broaden my horizons. However, I would like to ask you what observations you have about the Chinese press." He listened carefully, but answered something unrelated: "I have been reading the Shen Bao for nearly twenty years. I don't remember the number of Chinese journalists I have met, but the old journalists from seventeen or eighteen years ago are now very old, or many of them have died and were friends." I continued, "That is indeed an old story. In that case, I would like to ask you where the Uchiyama Bookstore was first established?" He touched his chin, which did not have a long beard, and smiled, "Still at that Weishengli. Twenty years ago, there were not many houses there. The Fumin Hospital was there, and the Guangxuehui was also there. It was like a village surrounded by wilderness. The current Yonganli area was the old Mingqiang Middle School, and there was also a Jesus Church. Around there, a Japanese youth association had also just been established. I was only thirty-one or thirty-two years old then, now I am fifty-two years old. I am four years younger than Mr. Lu Xun, who was fifty-six. It's a pity. I think of many friends from that time: Li Dazhao, Li Hanjun, Chen Duxiu... Now, none of these people can be seen!" He looked lost and wistful for a while. At the same time, he went to find a portrait of Mr. Lu Xun for me and wrote a few words on it. He said, "It's a pity, a real pity that such a person is missing from our casual talk seat." I felt that the atmosphere was too tense, so I switched to another topic: "What do you mean by taking the Chinese name Wu Qishan?" While writing, he said, "The Japanese pronunciation of Uchiyama sounds like 'Wuqi de Mo.' Wu Qishan is a half-Japanese, half-Chinese pronunciation of 'Uchiyama,' and it is also a very correct Chinese name, so I was very happy to adopt it." He immediately found two recent essay drafts for me to read, signed with the name Wu Qishan. I switched to another topic: "Do you like China very much?" "Of course I like it, having lived here for so long, especially Shanghai—what about you?" I found it difficult to answer, but I blurted out, "I love China as much as you cannot forget Japan. But for Shanghai, I feel somewhat differently. I feel that being in Shanghai, I don't feel like I'm in China!" He smiled awkwardly. He paused and said, "According to my observation, from the concrete things that exist in life (that is, in terms of what I call the culture of life), I believe that Shanghai hides China's actual culture of life. Any country will find it impossible to deal with it, but this power still permeates Shanghai! Twenty years of observing Shanghai, I believe this is the case. How many years have you been in Shanghai?" I said uneasily, "Only ten years." "Then I have ten more years than you!" A burst of laughter came from his wide mouth. The light from his near-sighted glasses flashed, indicating that he was shaking his head and very happy. Finally, I asked him if the casual talk sessions were continuing these days. He said, "Twenty years of observation may not be enough until thirty years. So this casual talk cannot be stopped. In addition to the essays collected in the book "A Japanese Person's View of China," there are many more, and perhaps another book will be compiled soon." At this time, I turned to the last page of "View of China" and saw Mr. Lu Xun's letter to the translator, saying: "Mr. Uchiyama's book has a different purpose. The various things he mentions, we ourselves do not notice until they are revealed, so it is interesting, but it would be harmful to be content with this." At this time, his store was about to close, so I said goodbye to Mr. Uchiyama.</p>

<h3 id="e204">Review of "Circus" <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Jizhi</p>
<p>The famous American writer A. Sinclair once said: "Art is propaganda." This is indeed a famous saying that gives the most accurate definition of art. We can say that all forms of ideology that are reflected in the superstructure of society due to changes in the infrastructure, whether they express praise, satire, or glorification of the future, have the primary purpose of "propaganda." However, this kind of "propaganda" must be accomplished with mature skills! Especially when it is visualized through theatrical means! It can achieve a universal and powerful effect. Otherwise, due to the poor skills and means, it will not only get the opposite "reaction," but also make "art" itself lose its value.</p>
<p>The film "Circus" demonstrates a new era of work. This not only demonstrates the Soviet Union's creativity and progress towards creating new art, but also tells us that new art has reached maturity.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union occupies a different economic field, and the ideology reflected in the ideological Voloshki has also formed another category. Therefore, in the past in all aspects, especially in art, the attitude of strict criticism and struggle was often taken towards the "legacy of the old": this is an inevitable phenomenon in the process of building a new social system. Now, after several struggles, the Soviet Union has built a considerable foundation in the economic field and has formed a stable state in all aspects of society; similarly, in art, it has also broken away from the tense stage, and has merged the old skills with the new struggle experience to create a new style. The film "Circus" can be said to be a representative work of this new style.</p>
<p>The writer of Mu used the method of symbolism to bring all the unfair phenomena in the world into this film. He also used the new romantic expression method to instill many "justice" and "truth" into the audience through humor. The Germans, "Colonel Knasitz," who symbolize the aggressors in our world, are impatient, narrow-minded, and bullying and humiliating to the weak, the "little black man," symbolizing the weak nations, and the coercion and oppression of the weak woman, "Mary," symbolizing the deprived and oppressed people of the world: All of this can deeply depict our real world. These three archetypes, in their short activities in this film, can be said to have vividly revealed the tyranny of the invaders and the suffering of the oppressed to the audience. On the other hand, the screenwriter also uses various people--Soviets, Georgians, Ukrainians, Jews, Tartars, etc.--for the helpless "little black man," not only because "Knassijue" announced that he was an "illegitimate child" and despised him, but instead, they loved him and passed him around, and used various languages to sing "lullaby" to comfort him. This refutes the "cruelty and inhumanity" of Knassijue, who represents the invaders, and represents the cry of sympathy from the various ethnic groups of the Soviet Union to the weak. The "Circus Manager" said to "Mary" in a humorous tone: "What is the black child afraid of? In the Soviet Union, as long as the child is healthy, it doesn't matter whether it is white, yellow, red, or pink... we want them all." This clearly expresses the Soviet Union's true intention of being international and non-national in a relaxed way.</p>
<p>Its decision is that the characteristic of "Circus" is the appearance of "tap dance" and "leg dance" that have never been seen in Soviet films; in the eyes of ordinary people, or like the past saying that the Soviet Union was capitalist, they thought they were also "leg" with the United States! In fact, it only adopted the old dance form and loaded it with new content, using entertainment to promote "science" and national defense. There are "parachutes" and "flying into the stratosphere", which can be said to be a kind of practical education for the audience, which is different from the general aestheticism of dance.</p>
<p>The author has consistently used the method of symbolism to transform this film into a miniature of the world. At the same time, it also uses several contrasting programs to cross the plot into two sides to symbolize the opposition and competition between the pacifists and the aggressors and all the old forces in the current world. "Knassijue"'s jealousy and sabotage of "Maldnov", and their "close-up" staring at each other on the glass window: This symbolizes the conspiracy of today's aggressors to attack pacifist countries. When "Knassijue" was frantically grabbing the "little black man" from the audience in the circus, he was suddenly stopped by two officers and made him flee in despair: This also symbolizes that only armed forces can stop the aggressor's aggression and brutality. After "Knassijue" and "Mary" performed "Flying to the Moon", Maldnov was moved and immediately wanted to perform "Flying to the Stratosphere". Although he failed because of "Knassijue"'s conspiracy, he was not discouraged, and finally succeeded. This symbolizes the Soviet Union's progressive spirit and competition with capitalism. When the program of "Flying to the Stratosphere" could not be performed, and the old circus manager had to bring out the old trick of "riding a unicycle in 1903" to comfort the audience, although they tried their best to perform it, so that they were "sweating profusely", this outdated trick of "hard work but no reward" could not satisfy the audience's wishes. This also symbolizes that today's world is already the realm of modern people, and everything old should give way.</p>
<p>The author's implication is so profound and meticulous, but the story itself is very simple. And it can establish various different archetypes in this narrow story field. At the same time, with the help of the director, each character in the play can represent a kind of "personality", and in the slow progress of the plot, the audience can slowly understand and understand each unique "personality", and finally get the most profound hit. Except for the role of "Knassijue", because it is necessary to achieve the task of the archetype of "rage"--this kind of "rage", "laughter", "sadness" and other roles are both laborious and difficult to please--the facial expression control is slightly more rigid and facial. Apart from the fact that the roles are more rigid and facialized, the other roles can be said to be able to paint out their characteristics in subtle opportunities.</p>
<p>The structure of the plot is tightly organized and not wasteful because the director uses several clever methods. For example, the part that shows "Mary" traveling all over the world after leaving the United States, and finally arriving at the "Circus" in the Soviet Union, uses the "earth" painted on the train to expand and rotate to become the "ball" in the circus, and the "Eros" imagined by "Maldnov" turned out to be the "Eros" on the satirical painting, and other similar "sketches"; and when "Maldnov" and "Knassijue" looked at each other on the glass window, ice flowers formed on the glass, and the "close-up" of "Knassijue"'s image was isolated. These are all created using the scientific method of "psychological association" and double-exposure. Here, the development of the plot is not cut off, the idea of kinship is destroyed, and the interest in the entire plot is affected because unnecessary "programs" are saved. Director G. Alexandrov can pay attention to these small places, which is indeed helpful to the success of "Circus". However, regarding the "Shi Jiamijing" fighting lions, although this is just to use "humor" to set off this "thrilling" festival, so as to avoid sudden psychological changes in the audience and affect the main plot: But if this "program" is inserted into the "Circus performance", it will appear more natural.</p>
<p>Among the actors, the actress Orlova, who plays "Mary", is indeed a laborious role. She not only has to speak two languages, but also has to sing and dance. Moreover, in the whole process of the play, "Mary's" encounters are extremely complicated: sometimes her life is persecuted, sometimes she is praised for her honor; sometimes she is beaten by the brutal, sometimes she is comforted by her lover; there is bright hope to make her happy, and there is sudden disappointment to make her sad. This role must maintain her unified character in the course of this curve in order to achieve a satisfactory result. And finally, Orlova succeeded.</p>
<p>The role of the manager's daughter "Laya" has appeared in every Soviet film. And the actors who play this type of archetype seem to have a natural "intelligence". She is "innocent", "honest", "careless", and even somewhat "Ah Q" type. Or maybe there are such characters in Soviet society? Perhaps the satire in the drama is "education" for society.</p>
<p>The characters like the "Circus manager" are also common in other Soviet films. The kind of "old man" who is "about to die" is still so lively, humorous, and energetic. I am afraid that only in Soviet society can you find such an old man who has forgotten his age.</p>
<p>In the past few Soviet films, what we have been given are some materials to help us understand the reality of the Soviet Union, or some hints of the future ideals. And "Circus" has gone beyond these scopes and given us many applied theories and skills. We should further learn from these valuable lessons.</p>

<h3 id="e205">How to Interact with People from Different Countries? <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Hui</p>
<p>Shanghai, it is said, has more than 30 nationalities living together with the Chinese. Except for a few high-ranking figures, most salaried people live in lane-style houses or in the new-style row apartments. In one building or one floor of an apartment, there are often people of different nationalities and different provinces. When going in and out, it is often inevitable to have contact with foreigners. At the same time, due to historical reasons and habits, the so-called special areas (the current name of the two concessions, which were called the Foreigner Residential Areas when they were first opened) in Shanghai are clearly divided into national areas. For example, Hongkou is mostly a gathering place for Japanese people, while White Russians gather in the area of Avenue Joffre, and Koreans mostly gather in the area of Route Père Robert. Of course, in the special area, as long as you are a taxpayer who pays taxes according to the regulations, you can choose a residence there at will, without any nationality restrictions. No one can interfere or refuse you. However, therefore, you must consciously or unconsciously use considerable common sense and skills to deal with your left and right neighbors in the residence area. Or, due to occupational reasons, you have to serve in foreign institutions and organizations every day: or, temporary responses and unexpected events make it necessary for you to contact foreigners. Or, later, you become friends. In addition, such as strolling in the park, playing in the ballroom, running along Avenue Joffre and North Sichuan Road, there are more opportunities to contact foreigners.</p>
<p>Let's talk about Japan and the Soviet Union first. People from these two countries are very different in habits and thoughts. But we don't need to care about that: we only ask ourselves how we should treat them. There are relatively few Soviet people in Shanghai. The so-called "Russian" people in Shanghai refer to White Russians. Most of these men work in electrical engineering, patrol the police station, drive buses, check tickets, or work as bodyguards; in addition to opening shops, most of the women work as maids, dancers, or disguised prostitutes. The so-called Russians that we contact in Shanghai are mostly these gentlemen and ladies. When you interact with them, you don't need to praise them for the Five-Year Plan, socialism, or great figures such as Lenin and Gorky. At most, talk about Tolstoy, Chekhov, or the king of songs, Shaliapin, etc. Speaking of Japanese people, they are almost everywhere in the Hongkou area of Shanghai. People in industry and commerce are very polite. According to Japanese people who have lived in Shanghai for a long time: "They are gold worshipers. As long as you have money, they can call you any nice name." However, when you interact with them, you must pay attention to their customs and habits. For example, when you go to a Japanese friend's house, you see that the husband sits and talks or eats with the guests in an arrogant manner, and the wife can only serve cups and pour drinks, add rice and pour tea, and serve with caution like a maid. That is their usual routine. You can't think that this is different from China, and think that your friend is too feudal, so you go to greet the sister-in-law, or repeatedly ask her to eat together before you are willing to move your chopsticks, etc. This is a courtesy in our country, but it will make the sister-in-law embarrassed in their home. It's best if you just ignore her. Also, you must think in advance that you must take off your shoes when you go to a Japanese home. You must pay attention to your feet that have not been washed for a few days and your broken socks in advance. Otherwise, when you get to the time, the wife and young lady of the family will kneel at the door to serve you to take off your shoes according to the rules, wouldn't you be embarrassed?</p>
<p>As for interacting with British people, who are known as gentlemen? Then you must first pay attention to etiquette. This does not mean that you have to dress up in a sophisticated and gorgeous manner; but it means: neat, solemn. Your hair should be combed neatly, and your short beard must be shaved off. If you want to keep a mustache, you must trim the rest neatly. When you go to his house, you must respect the women, you must greet them when you meet them, and you must thank them for any requests. The same as interacting with American women, but the words should be more careful and tactful. Because Americans have always spoken straightforwardly and quickly, while British people are relatively gentle and polite. So some people say: "When you go to a British home, you must first find their bathroom. You must quickly do things like grooming, washing your hands, brushing your clothes, and polishing your leather shoes as soon as you enter the door." This is indeed experienced advice!</p>
<p>It is relatively easy to interact with Americans and French people. But there are differences between the two countries. Most of the current interactions involve women. Americans respect women. For example, when you sit down, men must ask women to sit down first, and you must support them when walking. If two men and one woman walk together, the woman must be allowed to walk in the middle and the two men must support or hold her hand at the same time. If one man walks with two women, then the man should usually support the two women. If two women hold hands, then the man will have to take care of them left and right, serving the two women like a guide.</p>

<p>The famous Hollywood star, Miss Greta Garbo, says, "Health is our lifeline! It is what provides us with food and clothing!" Originally, in addition to art, what a movie actress needs most urgently are a healthy body and a beautiful appearance, like the peony and its green leaves, supporting each other. A reporter who had traveled to Hollywood once asked this mysterious woman, Garbo, "How can one maintain health for a long time?" According to her, "Go to bed early and wake up early every day, sleeping for eight hours is appropriate. Take a bath every day for ten minutes, using lukewarm water with a little milk and salt, and after the bath, apply a beauty lotion all over the body until it turns rosy. In my experience, golf is the most suitable exercise, or riding a bicycle. Because the beauty of the face is entirely created by the skin and flesh, which are nourished by blood, and blood is the crystallization of diet, its master is still nutrition, so I pay great attention to diet, the outline of which is as follows: (1) Choose vegetables rich in protein, and do not eat too much fatty food, for fear of making you fat easily. (2) Drink a glass of fresh milk every morning and afternoon. (3) Do not drink strong tea or smoke cigarettes. (4) Eat a small amount of fruit after meals to maintain cleanliness in the stomach and intestines, and avoid indigestion and all internal diseases.</p>
<p>As for makeup, its quality entirely depends on personal experience and the quality of the makeup and beauty products chosen. However, I can offer a few small suggestions:</p>
<p>(1) The best time for makeup is after getting up in the morning and after meals. Before makeup, put aside all worries, as a restless mood can greatly affect beauty! When applying powder, first apply Cartose oil all over the face, as it can make it even and prevent the face from being attacked by lead in the powder, which can cause spots. (2) The circles around the eyes should be light black, as dark ones appear unnatural. (3) Rouge should be red during the day and yellow in the evening, while lipstick should be dark red both day and night. (4) Avoid applying any perfume to the face, as it contains alcohol, which is very irritating and harmful to the skin. (5) At night when going to bed, apply a little fatty oil to the face to make the skin white and tender. If spots or wrinkles appear on the face, go to a beauty hospital for surgery immediately to prevent them from growing. And I think every movie star should know a familiar beauty doctor to maintain her youth."</p>

<p>duties. As for the French, if a French woman becomes your friend, she will often make you feel flattered and surprised by her intimacy. At the same time, if your female relative is with a French male friend, you may find it uncomfortable, and your female relatives may feel that he is impolite. In fact, this is just the habit of French friends, and they, like her, have no bad intentions. Therefore, special attention should be paid to this point. It is said that in Paris, there are actually social circles where people exchange wives for daily life, but that is a very small number of cases. The French do indeed take a calm view of entanglements between men and women, but in other people's countries, they also value friendship and politeness.</p>
<p>Let's talk about Germany. Due to the European War, we had little contact with Germans for a period of time. However, in factories and hospitals, male and female staff of this ethnicity always make up the majority. In recent years, there have been more opportunities for contact. They are both very dedicated to their duties and are very enthusiastic and careful to everyone in their duties. In social situations, they don't talk much and like to talk about sports and technology. It is also very beneficial to socialize with them.</p>

<h3 id="e207">How to Learn Sketching <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Dun</p>
<p>Painting is indeed interesting, especially "sketching." Because the materials are readily available, as long as you have a keen eye and a careful mind, and a clear judgment of beauty and ugliness, you can depict anything, and what you depict can become a beautiful work.</p>
<p>"Sketching" is generally divided into two types: one is "still life sketching" and the other is "landscape sketching." Still life sketching is a necessary step for those who learn to paint. Beginners always start by drawing plaster models. First, we prepare a triangular wooden frame, the height of which is equal to the chest when standing. Make several symmetrical holes on the left and right sides of the two feet in front of the wooden frame, and then prepare a large piece of thick paper or a thin piece of wood, insert wooden pillars into the holes in the feet, and hold up the thick paper or thin piece. Its position must be suitable for the line of sight of the eyes. What we want to depict can be hung on the opposite wall or placed on a high platform on the opposite side; this position cannot be arbitrarily placed. Beginners must place the drawing materials in a place with light coming from one side, that is, a place with horizontal light; because in this kind of light, it is easy to distinguish the light and dark of the object and feel the "three-dimensionality" and "distance" of the object. Once this position is arranged properly, then start painting: use nails to nail the drawing paper (usually called drawing paper) on the thick paper or thin board. If you are a beginner, directly use charcoal to draw the drawing materials in front of you on the paper. But is it considered a "masterpiece" if you just draw it like this? No, if you meticulously describe it like this, it simply becomes a rigid "explanatory diagram." Painting is like writing an article, you must give a "soul" to your work: that is, before applying charcoal to the drawing paper, you must carefully observe the shape, light and dark, and color of each part of the drawing material, and deeply imprint it on your brain, and then make a real description. Only by first understanding the overall posture and interest of the drawing material can you discover its charm in the overall composition of the color, light and dark, and lines of the object. This kind of "discovery" seems very abstract, but in fact, as long as you practice more and observe more, you will gain it unintentionally.</p>
<p>If the material taken is relatively complicated and cannot be finished in a short period of time, you can put it down and continue the next day. However, the painting time each time must be fixed at the same time. If the first time is started in the morning, you must continue to work in the morning from then on; because the light is different in the morning and afternoon, and the light and dark shown on the object will naturally be different; this does not matter much to people with a foundation in painting; but for beginners, there will be difficulties because the same drawing material will show various different phenomena due to different light.</p>
<p>Secondly, if you want to color, in addition to the above points, you must also pay attention to the color tone of the drawing material. If it is a plaster statue or porcelain, etc., because it is white itself, it will be difficult to show the concavity and convexity of the object if it is placed on a white background. Therefore, the color of the drawing material and the background must be very clear and harmonious; for example, if you want to draw a white porcelain pot with tangerines and apples in it, in order to show its color, you can use a light blue (that is, lake blue) cloth as a lining in the back, so you can get a vivid impression of the color of each object.</p>
<p>For paintings that need to be colored, first use charcoal to draw the general outline on drawing paper or canvas according to an appropriate composition. After drawing, gently sweep away the heavy ash of the charcoal; (those with a painting foundation often do not use charcoal, but directly use an oil painting brush to dip in color and draw the outline) then paint it stroke by stroke according to the color of the original object. In purple drawing (only using charcoal to draw without coloring), it is often natural to use charcoal to describe the concentration of light or shadows, but in the description of color, it is necessary to express these parts with the contrast of color tones.</p>
<p>Whether it is monochrome drawing or color description, in addition to paying attention to "light and dark" and "color," the proportions of each part of the object cannot be ignored at all. We often see strange phenomena in advertisements on the market, such as a hat worn on the chest or arms longer than the legs, which are all due to not paying attention to the proportions of each part of the object. Learning painting must learn "perspective," which is to correct this kind of error, but if we don't have much time to study this step, when we paint, we use the pen in our hand as a ruler to roughly measure each part of the object. When measuring, there is no need to run close and pick up the object to measure it. We just stand far away, squint one eye, raise the pen, look over, and see how many parts of the pen each part occupies, and then compare it with each part of our spirit.</p>
<p>After having sufficient training in still life sketching, you can learn "landscape sketching."</p>
<p>The most difficult thing in landscape sketching is that the light and dark are not easy to grasp, because landscape sketching is mostly outdoors, and the light and dark outdoors are abnormally complex, but if you have a considerable foundation in still life sketching, this kind of difficulty is still easy to avoid.</p>
<p>Outdoors, the sunlight is constantly moving, so the light and dark parts or silhouettes shown on the famous things are also moving all the time. For example, the shadow of a tree is here at first sight, and in an instant, it has stretched to the other side. Therefore, the person who sketches must describe it as much as possible within the period when the scenery has not changed much. If you feel that the scenery is too different from when you first came, it is not suitable to continue, it is better to stop immediately and come to work again at the same time tomorrow, otherwise, the whole painting will be changed here and there, and it will fall into a situation where it is all worthless.</p>
<p>If you go to a place and can't decide which part to take as a drawing material for a while, then you can use a pencil to roughly sketch several parts of what you see in the sketchbook (there are special ones for sale) in advance. By comparing the parts with each other, you can decide which one you want to take. With the material, then, like still life sketching, first understand the structure of the part to be described. For example, there is a small stream in that part, and there are a few sparse trees on one side of the stream, with the shadows of the trees quietly reflected in the water, and the other side is full of fluffy green grass, and in front is a wide field, and in the farthest place (distant view) there are smoky forests... To describe this, first define a horizon line on the drawing paper or canvas to determine the position of the distant view, and then use this horizon line as a starting point to arrange the positions of the foreground and the main objects, such as trees, streams, and stream banks. After deciding, first draw the general outline. If coloring, first dye the color of the sky, and then paint the middle view and distant view in order. Naturally, when drawing these, you must not only pay attention to the shape of the objects, but also pay attention to the contrast between light and dark and the difference in the distance of each scene at all times. Otherwise, all the objects will stick together, and the three-dimensional shape will not be shown.</p>
<p>When sketching in strong sunlight, the screen must be protected from direct sunlight. In strong sunlight, a sketching umbrella can be used and inserted next to the easel (use the easel for still life sketching) to shield the sunlight. If you don't use an umbrella, you can borrow the shelter of the leaves under the shade of a tree. If there is strong sunlight in front of the painting or strong light reflected from the ground, it is not suitable for sketching and should be avoided. Also, if there is a strong wind and the easel is not stable, you can find a stone and hang it in the middle of the three feet to prevent the easel from being blown over by the wind by relying on the force of the center of gravity.</p>
<p>What has been said above is just a general outline of sketching. This is originally a special subject that requires a long time to study. However, if we know a little bit about the doorway and practice diligently, we will also have excellent results. For example, Millet in France was so poor that he couldn't even afford charcoal and drawing paper, where would he have the money to go to school to listen to "Perspective" and "Painting Theory"? However, his works "Evening Bell," "Gleaners," and "Sheep Flock," painted with pitiful coal ash and waste paper, have become priceless treasures to this day.</p>

<h3 id="e208">The Chemical Warfare Preparations of the Great Powers <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Bi Jia</p>
<p>As everyone knows, chemical weapons such as poison gas, smoke bombs, and incendiary bombs were actually used in the World War of 1914-18. After the war, the great powers worked even harder to prepare for chemical warfare. Their military experts and scientists were always publicizing the great role of chemical weapons and were always working hard to invent new killing weapons. General Fuller of England once said: "The shells 'die' as soon as they fall on the ground; while the micro-molecules of chemical substances, when released, can continue to 'survive'. Whether on the ground or underground, even after a few days, it will give everything a terrible blow." General De Ve of Italy also pointed out that chemical weapons can be sent to extremely far places and have a great effect, saying that they can not only attack the enemy's front, but also harass its rear, and thus assert that the emergence of airborne chemical weapons will change all forms of warfare. In this way, the importance of the task played by chemical weapons in the upcoming world war can be imagined.</p>
<p>The great powers' preparations for chemical warfare are first manifested in the chemical industry. After the war, based on the experience of the application of chemical weapons, the imperialist powers all worked hard to create and develop chemical industry departments directly related to the production of chemical weapons. These industrial sectors mainly produce chlorine, arsenic, sulfur, rayon, nitrogen, aniline dyes, and other chemical drugs. In recent years, due to the increasing tension in the world situation, the production capacity of chemicals by the imperialist powers has shown an alarming increase. For example, the possible production capacity of chlorine in the great powers recently is shown as follows——</p>
<p>United States 600,000 tons</p>
<p>France 100,000 tons</p>
<p>Japan 130,000 tons</p>
<p>Germany 150,000 tons</p>
<p>England 100,000 tons</p>
<p>Poland 100,000 tons</p>
<p>However, the actual production volume of chlorine in various countries showed the following state——</p>
<p>United States 300,000 tons</p>
<p>France 70-75,000 tons</p>
<p>Japan 70-80,000 tons</p>
<p>Germany 100-35,000 tons</p>
<p>England 70-75,000 tons</p>
<p>Poland 30-40,000 tons</p>
<p>In this way, if the chlorine production capacity of the great powers is compared with their actual production volume (especially the consumption volume), then the imbalance can be clearly seen. This alarming imbalance fully illustrates the efforts of the great powers in the production and preparation of chlorine.</p>
<p>Among the great powers, the most effort in the development of the chemical industry has been made by Japan in the East and Germany in the West. In Japan, the development of the rayon industry has first attracted the attention of the world. According to the survey, in the recent three years, the Japanese rayon industry has</p>
