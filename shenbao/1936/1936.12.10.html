<h3>津傳某方　對綏事力戒擴大　變更策略再圖進攻　靑案亦主就地解决　日樞密院嚴重質詢有田外交各方認綏青案搆成中日僵局</h3>
<p>（天津）津某方透出消息、中央部近日集議結果、業有電訓令駐華北關外海陸機關、對綏遠靑島兩問題、力戒擴大、就地解决無損顏面卽可、綏遠事先强化蒙僞軍內部、變更進展策略、待事態冷靜後、再攻其不備、頃津口口軍部已令派赴靑口口參謀、卽將此意轉達駐靑谷荻武官、並取得第三艦隊海軍側同意、故靑案日內可急轉直下解决、綏遠最近亦不致發生大戰、（九日專電）</p>
<p>（東京）九日樞密院例會後　賡續舉行自由辯論、達二小時之久、當時曾對有田之外交、提出至嚴重之質詢、並提出如下之願望、是不啻爲對有田之警吿、其願望略謂、謹防外交政策在國策上所鑄成之錯誤、將招致國家不可挽回之禍息、政府必充分凖備堅决信仰、勿爲鄙陋主義所誤導、或爲有力方面所克復、因而損害國家之根基、至所提之質問、約如下述、關於中日談判政府之對策如何、中日判在日本國策之目光中觀之雖爲最重要者、但實際已吿决裂、綏遠事伴爲談判之阻碍、政府於實行外交政策時、缺乏統制、中日談判有賡續舉行之希望乎、僞滿總理張景惠之宣言發表前、曾得日本之默許、果屬實乎、關東軍之宣言、表面上雖無問題、但苟與外務省宣言對照、則與人以不統一之印象矣、關於上述問題、有田答曰、中日談判最初順利進行、但因綏遠事件及日德協定突轉惡化、談判遂陷入僵局、然仍未至决裂之程度、現綏遠漸趨寗靜、希望若干時後、中國之誤解能消釋、則中日關係之調整尙可有望、關於張景惠之宣言外務省尙未接獲關東軍司令植田之報吿、關東軍之宣言、乃以日滿聯合防禦爲目的、而外務省之宣言、則以日本外交政策爲主旨云、聞樞密院對有田之答復、並不滿意、目前問題有引起强烈內爭之極大可能、（九日中央社電）</p>
<p>（東京）近數日來、不僅報紙批評對首相廣田外相有田之外交政策、及秘密外交、有至猛烈之抨擊、卽樞密院及政黨方面、亦均以嚴詞責難、其被攻擊目標之一、卽爲漁業協定、未　獲得蘇聯之簽字、此項協定、業經樞密院通過、而經外相有田保證蘇聯必可簽字者、但因日德協定之成立、蘇聯乃無期延擱、尤其因鑒於一種事實、卽凡經樞密院通過之條約、而不獲簽字者、日本外交史上無此前例、故嚴厲糾彈政府之責任、另一攻擊之目標、則爲中日談判經過情形、中國外交部現已宣佈、而日本政府始終對人民秘而不宣、因此各方對日本外交當局所採政策及策略、均紛加責難、綏遠靑島事件、構成目前僵局之直接原因之事實、使各方面深感外交非一元化」之缺陷、故譴責政府統制失敗之聲浪、隨處可聞、政友會議員安籐八日向廣田首相有田外相提出最嚴重之責問、卽中日談判是否决裂、日本對綏遠局勢之眞態度若何、廣田有田答曰、談判暫吿停頓、但非决裂、現正待適當時機之恢復、綏遠局勢與「滿洲國」有關、但與日本無關、且無更趨惡化之傾向云、安籐復質問日本旣昭吿世界、日本與綏遠事件無關、則日本必負責使世界信賴日本之官言、關於此點、廣田有田答謂、局勢眞相不久自明、安籐又以錄利口吻責問中央政府與駐外各官員間對於外交問題之意見、發生巨大裂痕、甚至有互相矛盾之處、政府是否擬設法處置目前之局勢　廣田有田直認彼等亦有同感、並保瞪將繼續從事工作、以實現一元化云、同時民政黨因僞滿總理張景惠、八日發表贊助蒙軍宣言、已着手調査此頃宣言、是否係得日本之默許、樞密院於九日舉行例會時、將有激烈之辯論、（九日中央社電）</p>
<p>（東京）有田外相於九日樞府本會議完畢後、說明目下之諸問題、請求樞府方面之諒解、當日會議後、外相說明之內容、大體如下、</p>
<p>日意協定</p>
<p>日意協定、僅日意兩政府間交換公文、並不含有任何協定之性質、該規定除已發表者外、別無何項規定、惟確保在阿比西尼亞之經濟權益、則今後進行細目協定、</p>
<p>日蘇漁業</p>
<p>日蘇漁業條約、根據樸資茅斯條的、蘇俄方面負有法理上締結之義務、又同時目的在預防發生與日本北洋漁業有關之紛爭、以期行使日本之漁業權、故確信非如蘇俄所得拒絕調印問題、蘇俄方面現藉口國內手續、但國內手續並不若是永久、因此日本始終在條約滿期前講求萬全之措置、務令調印竣事、</p>
<p>中日交涉</p>
<p>中日交涉並非卽此終了、政府方面今後令須磨總領事繼續事務的交涉細目、始終期交涉目的、中日兩國國交之圓滿調整、（九日同盟電）</p>
<h3>靑島日陸戰隊未撤　雙方意見一度參差又轉緩和　及川離靑返國工人多數回籍</h3>
<p>（靑島）沈鴻烈與西春彥數决會談後、雙方意見本已接近、乃八日後兩方主張又有參差、幾成僵局、九日晚繼續談判、多方折衝、開誠協商、又轉和緩、有急轉直下之可能、（九日專電）</p>
<p>（靑島）及川九日午前乘原田丸離靑返國、日領西春彥與海陸各關係方面人員、及我第三艦隊司令謝剛哲·沈鴻烈代表周家彥、均到埠送行、（九日專電）</p>
<p>（青島）靑島事件、現正由沈鴻烈與西春彥交涉中、四方·滄口·一帶各工廠工人、已多數離靑、被裁之工人、由廠方會同官方、給資遣送回籍、（九日專電）</p>
<p>（濟南）韓談、靑島郭局長來濟、談靑事已有和平解决望、（九日專電）</p>
<p>（南京）日兵非法在靑島登陸後、經沈市長鴻烈興日領西春彥、迭决交涉、已漸趨和緩、日陸戰隊卽可撤退、其撤退時間、尙未接沈電吿、（九日專電）</p>
<p>（靑島）此間形勢九日仍極緩和、惟四方滄口一帶之日陸戰隊、尙無撤退之準備二雙方警備情形如故、各馬路上時有日兵來往、多係臯月等艦之徒手水兵、交涉進行業已六决、九日午前市府參事周家彥又與日領館館員有所接洽、沈鴻烈與西春彥晚間將繼續談判、據確息、雙方咸欲尅日解决、在原則上已無問題、目前所爭執者、在工廠復工與日兵撤退孰先孰後問題而已、我方以爲在日兵威脅之下、欲使工人安心復工、事實上有絕大困難、且日兵一日不撤、則我方亦無從調解工潮也、日方雖提出多項要求、而其注意點、亦祇在早日復工、蓋九家紗廠如長此停閉、日方所受之損失至鉅、其渴求從速解决、自不待言、長谷川淸抵靑後、與各艦長及駐靑武官等迭有會議、惟尙未訪沈、一週來此間日商因營業蕭條、允願早日恢復原狀、（九日中央社電）</p>
<p>（濟南）靑島電話、九日下午二時許、長谷川偕各艦長等、分乘汽車赴四方滄口各紗廠視察、四時始返市內、八日夜十二時沈鴻烈與靑日領會談、仍無結果、紗廠一部復工說不確、工廠開除之工人五百餘人、公安局拘押之工人百餘人、由市政府召集資遣回籍、（九日中央社電）</p>
<p>（南京）日水兵擅在靑登陸搜査黨部逮捕職員、全國人民聞之均極憤慨、茲悉豫滇鄂各省黨部、均以日兵如此無理、蔑視我主權已至極點、先後電呈中央、懇卽函政府、迅速抗議嚴重交涉、並要求適常賠償、以維國體而平民憤、（九日中央社電）</p>
<p>（南京）靑島日商紗廠自全體罷工以來、失業工人、的達二萬九千名、卷屬因之無依者、不下十萬人、時値隆冬、如不能復工、則飢寒交迫、况工人中允以婦孺爲多、非急籌救濟不可、現聞政府對於此事極爲關心、爲實施救濟起見、已由行政院與有關係各省市、妥籌切實有效辦法、以期早日安置失業工人、免致流離失所、（九日中央社電）</p>
<p>（靑島）此間現共泊有日艦八艘、合計其兵力的三千人、華方現覺駐靑島附近之華軍實力、力足應付或將發生之事變、但衆料交涉可望和平解决、不致用及武力、此間謠言雖熾、但緊張之局勢已漸見和緩矣、（九日路透電）</p>

<p>（南京）中日調整關係交涉川越赴滬後、仍在沉寂中、我國駐日大使許世英近會訪日外務當局晤談、據外交界息、許使在東京方面曾晤及其外交當局、但無新接洽、（九日專電）</p>

<h3>中日前途　關臽繫於日本</h3>
<p>—朝日新聞之評論—</p>
<p>爲敵爲友視日政策如何</p>
<p>（東京）朝日新聞今日社評、略謂、中日談判之决裂、已成不可掩飾之事實、無人願見中日關係之益趨緊張、但中日情勢自目前决裂後、有極端嚴重之傾向、今日之中國、顯非日本之友、此後是否使中國爲友、或迫之爲敵、僅繫於日本之决意云、據記者觀察、日本一般輿論、現正嚴重注視中日兩國之前途、同時並不放棄打開目前僵局之希望、但决定中日情勢之關鍵、顯握於日本當局之手中、蓋視其如何變更對華之政策耳、（九日中央社電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>糧食政策的一貫性</h3>
<p>— 柳</p>
<p>最近上海糧食市塲。又掀起軒然大。波第一。嘉定縣扣留過境米船。積至二百餘艘幾。使閘北米市無市可言。但是因爲行政院通過暫時調節辦法的緣故本月。八日蘇省府會議時。已將省頒嚴禁食糧出口暫行辦。法議决廢止。並飭嘉定縣將米船放行。這一問題總　獲得解决。浙省樂淸被扣米船的釋放。想亦不成問題。</p>
<p>第二。粉麥上漲漫無止境有。幾次甚至漲到了一角限　。照前天的收盤行市遠期（四月期）粉已出了。四元一角麥亦在七元。以上如此狂跳暴漲別的且不說就是二百四。十文一斤切麵恐也不免漲價這與一。般平民生計是有絕大關係的。</p>
<p>第三。雜糧油豆的。升漲歷久不衰也。是大可注意的事。自從東北四省失去之後我國不。但對外貿易失了挹法。卽雜糧供給也受着絕大。影響尤其是油豆行。市一直爲人操縱要傾銷。就貶價出售要把持就抬。價不放而且年來各國從事於糧食。國防的建設對於。米麥油豆一類的食糧正。在儘量積儲價格的繼長增高大。半原因就在此。</p>
<p>上述三端不禁引起我們一些雜感來。我們以爲禁止出口雖。不必亟亟但如今年粳米薄稻運往津。靑烟各地數量之鉅。恐爲歷年所未有如果。係供北方民食之用。自不必說若別有作用則米糧到。了走私最活動區域難保不同樣走私那就値得注意至於。粉麥漲價卽使因爲本麥不足濟。用非洋麥不能解决而洋麥。又爲進口稅之故不合訂購亦當卽籌辦法。不容坐視不理否則如其原料的關係尙淺投機。之作用爲多則交易所在政府監理之。下理應加以取締無。使爲害民食再就一般糧食來說今。年入秋以來報旱荒者時有所聞我們不能以今年。如何豐收而一味樂觀要知在無統計。調查之現狀下明年的大威糧荒。最很有可能性的我們當知。在今日情勢之下糧食國防的建設是急不容緩了糧食的出納固。應受相當的管理糧食的調節無。論平時戰時也都應。作統盤的籌畫總之糧食政策是。整個的一貫的必須有一個中心的執行機關握其樞紐就較大。的利害關係來定確當的計畫如。果只是枝枝節節做去則不。但易滋糾紛就是對於日後的民食問題。也是有害無益的。</p>

<p>土肥原秘抵嘉卜寺</p>
<p>前任日　東軍特務機關長土肥原賢二、不知由何地何時、秘密到達嘉卜寺政府、連日與偽盟某方政務參事官·某務機關長·以及匪偽各軍事首領、作密秘會商、聞土肥原日內即離嘉卜寺、二輕局赴平津、向某駐屯軍最高首腦、有所申述、現在之嘉卜寺、已成為匪偽軍後方之中心、則此停駐張北飛機場之飛機、現已全數西開、大部均在嘉卜寺·小部停在商都、統計參加綏邊戰事之某國飛機、約有五十餘架、其原存商都之大批彈藥·軍需·糧秣等、自本月一日起、均已用汽車陸續運至嘉卡寺存儲、某方連日徵調民夫、在嘉卡寺漏夜趕築汽油庫、擴大飛機場面積、惟因氣候特寒、工程進行、極為困難、</p>
<p>匪偽各軍調動情況</p>
<p>察北之匪偽蒙熱各軍、近日調動均忙、因某方於本月一日在嘉卜寺關發各匪部餉項後、即傳有本月十日前開始向綏邊作第三次總攻之訉、計有熱河匪軍　俊哲部三千餘人、二日由圍場節節西進、五日到達百靈廟附近、將參加反攻百靈廟、現拉木楞臺駐有蒙匪軍八千餘人、其中騎兵最多、約六千餘人、某方所組之督戰隊、現駐嘉卜寺、其正規軍一部二千餘人、二日晚由多倫間抵嘉卜寺、附帶砲兵二百餘、大小砲十餘尊、機構槍隊一隊、機槍十餘挺、現正準備開往綏東之陶林、張海鵬偽部三千人、六日已在陶林東北之八臺集中完畢、亦準備參加西犯、駐大青溝李守信部之偽軍、自三日以後、陸續開赴商都、駐寳昌之卓、　海殘部五百餘人、五日亦開抵商都王英匪部之騎兵、已全數開往綏北、王本人現在商都、已被某方軟禁、出入行動、均有人暗中跟隨監視、其全部兵額、統計尚不足四千、四日夜間、有王之某連長、因與某某之指揮官意見不合、竟以手槍將某指揮官擊斃、當時逃往綏北後草地、駐南壕塹之張萬慶匪部、五日夜間、有五十餘人、携帶槍枝、潛向興和之綏防軍投誠反正、</p>
<p>匪偽軍火運輸數量</p>
<p>張北縣地勢衝要、某方供給匪偽全部之軍火、　由此經過、雖不能盡知其詳確數量、但約略尚可估計、本月四日、一載重汽車一隊六十餘輛、內中有二十輛裝載子彈等軍火、三十餘輛裝糧秣及其他軍用品、均係由多倫運赴去嘉卜寺、炸彈及砲彈等十餘車、其彈藥箱上、均印有某國某廠制造及「滿洲」國製造等字樣、四日午刻、復由張北運出機械油、及汽油等二十餘汽車、係分赴商都嘉卜寺者、五日早、有由張北運往商都軍火十汽車、汽油五百餘桶、此外如助戰之飛機、聞現由東北開到多倫飛機場者、有某國及偽國之徽者、約六十餘架、</p>
<p>張北民眾備受摧殘</p>
<p>察北各匪偽、近向民間大事需索、如徵調民夫·大車·騾馬等、無日無之、張北城內之李守信部偽軍尤甚、并向商家敲詐、人人無不痛恨、李近更向城內六七十家麺鋪、每日每家徵索白麺一百斤、祇給官價七元五角、每日均有六七千斤白麺輸出、其他細糧、亦時被徵發、致民食常起恐慌、現附近廟灘地方、發現土匪一小股、約百餘人、時常出沒搶刦、故城內外之民眾、均難安居、深盼國軍早日到達、以解此倒懸、又近來某方深恐其後路遭遇國軍襲擊、特令各偽機關嚴密護防各項通訉機關及軍事設備工程、其情況殆極為顧慮也、（六日）</p>
<h3>粵建廳長　劉維熾談粵省建設　以鄰省餘米調劑粵省糧食　省營各工廠可由人民承辦　絲業貸款計劃規定三步驟</h3>
<p>廣州通訉、粵省建設、自劉維熾長建廳後、規劃進行、甚為積極、頃據劉氏談粵省建設事業最近之進行、甚為詳細、茲分紀如下、</p>
<p>救濟糧食</p>
<p>本省糧食、頗為缺乏、兼以今年晚造歉收、粵湘贛皖四省、自倡議經濟合作後、本省所缺乏之糧米、將擬組織糧運公司、由各省將餘糧運來、邇因湘米銷粵辦法、尚未訂妥、故擬先與江西試辦、但此事仍須攷慮、本來以外省之有餘、補本省之不足、事屬至善、且出禾收獲豐敷、關係天時氣候、本省今年雖吿歉收、但鄰省豐收、彼此互相救濟、實為調劑及充實糧食之唯一辦法、但最近有一部人、則主張減收洋米入口稅、俾外米充分八口、藉資調劑、但兄弟仍以為以鄰省運米來粵救濟一項、較為妥善、在此兩辦法未確定以前、本省糧食問題、仍待磋商、尚無澈底之解決、</p>
<p>招承省廠</p>
<p>關於省營商承辦、確有此意、在政府方面經營之工業、如認為商人能力可能辦到者、可由商人辦理較妥、但其規模較大者、則須由政府舉辦、蓋政府近來興辦之工廠、并無如何便利、因現在決定、人民與政府所辦工廠、須一律繳納各項稅款也、且現有各商民、亦頗願意接辦、以前各省營工廠、其辦理設備責任、均歸於建設廳、現建設廳已成立省營工業總管理處及監理會、此後發展工廠計劃與原料購置等、均須由該兩機關辦理、該兩機關妥　手續後、則呈省府、交省務會議討論、經過多次之手續及各機關之設計、則此後省營各工廠設備、是否適合與週密、不只是設應負責已也凡舉辦事業、財政與經濟、須互相策應、財政應顧及經濟、經濟亦須顧及財政、不能　談、總之、兄弟以為省營各工廠、人民能力所能辦到者、仍交由人民承辦為善、政府可減少一筆流動資金之準備、國民經濟、才可以發展、</p>
<p>開發瓊崖</p>
<p>開發瓊崖實業、政府方面、因暫時尚無確定之資本、故現在主張獎勵人民投資興辦、政府對於發展瓊崖事業計劃、經決定先由利便交通着手、其瓊島公路、經已建築完成、惟因經費無着、橋樑設備、尚未施工、照預算上以士敏土建築、須款七八十萬元、若用杉木、則須十餘萬元、此項經費、除在築路經費項下撥支外、其餘尚在籌措中、將來在行畫溢利項撥還、至於今後發展瓊崖交通計劃、除已飭令瓊崖公路行車管理處加緊進行、將來并計劃建築海港及大參碼頭、以便船舶停泊、此外并　建築鐵路或闊大之公路、俾能與四面貫通、宋委員長此次赴瓊、對瓊崖　展計劃、亦決定仿效興辦、現先往視察、以便施行、至於東西沙群島、出產海草頗富、久已為外人垂涎、時往偷採、政府已設計防止、以免富源被人所奪、</p>
<p>水鐵兩廠</p>
<p>翁江水電前經當局設計、因工程浩大、需費頗巨、迄今仍未施行建築、茍將來該電廠完成、對於救濟農村水利等事業、當能澈底解決、兄弟以為政府能力、暫時未能舉辦時、即使藉外資辦理、亦屬無妨、全部費川、須五千萬元以上、政府一時確難辦到、鋼鐵廠進行情形、與決定先由技術財政兩方面着手、自本廳派何技士赴京請示後、經決定仍由本省繼續辦理、由中央當局予以相當補助云云、</p>

<p>滬南　昨日各帮來源因被前阻於內江之船隻漸閘開通、致抵埠者驟湧、共到竟達一百六七十號、貨共三萬四五千石、內中薄稻仍占大數、計有百十餘號、所幸包胃亦暢、平津靑烟等帮辦薄稻萬三四千包及厚粳五千餘包、且本街銷塲亦可、是故剩者無多、幾全開通、惟不過包胃經此一番購辦、未免有飽滿之狀、是以反形呆化、結果厚薄粳價悉祇定局、杜洋尖及陰變元因乏貨胃香、再呈秀色、不過高低不一耳</p>
<p>客秈　昨日客秈市况、本街進胃仍貪、囤戶續有問津、而河南去胃依然活躍、市面本有繼漲增高之必要、但前昨長江到頭甚旺、新到日有一萬數千包、且因嘉定等處被扣灑下米亦均全部放行、一部份本街與客邦均停手觀望、而貨主以存到兩旺、亦願隨市脫手、因此漲風已止、全日開出贛米四千六百四十七包、湘米九百四十五包、溫秈三千包、嘉興糙三百五十包、價與前市相似云、</p>
<h3>芝蔴一日數漲</h3>
<p>洋荘芝蔴市况、因各產地聞有某信託社　荘放價勁辦、故近日來源更受重大影響、致交易所標準市價、被一般空戶爭抵、行情一日數漲、且現貨市塲續有洋行勁辦、市况有直上靑雲之槪、泮荘凈貨自合義洋行以十三元五角辦去二百噸、至昨市出東洋帮放至十三元九角之價、成交一百噸、大局頗屬有榮無辱、對於十四元大關有非衝破不可之勢、現貨毛蔴東洋帮及紹興榨油銷塲、亦不惡、昨市成交各　一千六七百包云、</p>
<h3>紗花　空方獲利補進　標紗後市突緊</h3>
<p>紗布晨跌午漲、氣勢轉挺、蓋以市價回跌後、空頭抵補、至於大戶多頭脊吸收加碼、於是多空兩方並駕前驅、致檯面乾涸、市態回緊、午後某棉業公司巨量購進八千包、並有流言利多、漲風復起矣、但現紗交易、極形黯淡云、</p>
<p>標紗遠期漲一元餘</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、十二月期市態平疲、趨見下挫、拍至遠期上漲一元、二盤十二月期忽漲一元、遠月猛瀉二元外、因紗銷不暢、且連朝往漲為數殊巨、市價一定、獲利者則擁擠而來、同業多數傾向翻空、因此跌勢亦劇、結果本月比上日收盤價猛跌三元半、遠跌一元二角至二元二角、午後開盤、本月市况仍疲、拍至遠期、以三品紗市上升、且大戶在前市仍拖進、檯面尤湧、實則市價低落後、獲利者紛起扒補、而回高矣、結果各月比上午收盤價均漲二元九角至三元半、查賣出元一四千〇五十包、潤康一千六百五十包、望泰興一千一百五十包、協成一千二百五十包、愼記二千六百包、合興八百五十包、長餘八百包、大昌成九百包、買進錦昌為一千包、昶記一千包、恒德一千五百包、益　五千四百包、長豐五千四百包、大昶二千五百五十包、同和一千一百五十包、豐泰九百包、一日間行市比較如下、</p>

<h3>期棉隨紗市起伏不定</h3>
<p>棉市始跌繼漲、市情依然和平、但美棉五次估計發表、產量為一千二百四十萬零七千包、比上次增七千包、市價反堅而漲十餘磅音、因之人心良好、兼之各鄕擯價甚力、故爾來到貨稍稀、然廠方納胃甚薄耳、</p>
<p>標花漲跌尚微</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、市况平穩、因美棉第五次會計發表產額為一千二百四十萬零七千包、比上屆增七千包市價上漲九至十四磅音、印棉平靜、市塲人心良好、均漲一角半、但入後因紗市不良、受其打擊而回挫、結果各月比上日收盤價均跌五分至二埆半、午後開盤隨紗市回好、二盤又入疲途、迨至三收盤、紗市漲風復熾、人心激昂、結果各月比上午收盤價漲一角至二角半、查賣出長和五萬一千七百擔、元一一千三百擔、台興四千七百担、錦昌一千二百担、興昌一千三百担、仁丰三千四百担、協成一千七百担、生源二千担、源興昌三千一百担、大昌盛六千七百担、益昶七千八百担、潤康一千八百担、新昶一千六百担、泰昌五千一百担、福康四千一百担、一晶間行市比較如下、</p>

<h3>絲茶　白廠經絲　比最高價已小五十元</h3>
<p>輯里絲則頗覺堅挺</p>
<p>本市絲業、白廠經仍見黯淡、昨遠昌洋行進B字七八勻度二〇包、價七二〇元、較月前約跌三〇元、較最高價時跌五十元之譜、但交易依然寂寞、印荘絲市續呈挺秀、輯里下午售開六二〇元、紅團龍等級者售開六九〇元、較月前漲二〇元左右、目下走銷仍暢、市盤將更堅挺、用戶絲本埠進胃微弱、杭紹諸埠、亦無生氣、總之遜來國外絲市之不振、致本埠更少建樹矣、</p>
<h3>貢熙茶印商續有需求</h3>
<p>市面已呈供不敷求　實寫近年來所罕見</p>
<p>貢熙絲茶、向以俄銷為大宗、年來因該荘銷路銳减、各地製茶商家、遂亦改變製法、極力减縮本年貢熙花色、僅祇三萬餘箱、前因印度荘去路活潑、俄荘亦繼續搜辦、市上存底業已銷售一空、最近印荘尚多來電需購、但已供不應求、此為年來未有之景象、珍眉絲茶土荘貨亦多廓淸、來路荘貨、錦隆怡和等行、因國外來電所需、頗有一二千箱、正在談盤論價中云、</p>
<h3>糖市　泉州新片靑不日可到</h3>

<h3>雜項　雖曰外交緊張　日貨進口湧旺　日本應如何保持其優勢</h3>
<p>近兩月來、中日外交雖緊張、綏東北戰事仍策動、而日貨進口、反較前湧旺、其中以砂器·鉛皮·鉛　·漂粉·鹽硫酸及鹹魚等類為最多、自星期日至昨日三日內、有三輪進口、共計一萬餘噸、聞砂糖約二萬二千餘包、又有昨日進口之日輪、除裝砂糖鉛皮鹹魚等外、尚有人造絲一千餘包、約値三十餘萬元、不但如此、日貨進口在近兩月中、已一躍而登首位、惟日本仍不肯轉換其心理與手段、若得幡然改計、可長保其對華貿易之榮盛、乃不此注意、是誠可惜、</p>
<h3>蘭花子產價上展</h3>
<p>蘭花子久無續到、查號貨業已吿罄、各行存底亦已有限、故市勢轉緊、昨據厦門函訊、產區貨底、以現非出產時期、數亦單　、色香俱佳之貨更缺、好貨劃申須三十八九元之　比　須漲四五元、</p>

<p>附呈限制購船年齡困礙事實、及請求變通辦法意見書、限制購船年齡之意見、（一）我國航業、尙在幼稚時代、統計全國所有商船噸位、（五百噸以上）僅四十四萬七千餘噸、以全世界輪船（五百噸以上）合計而比較之、不及百分之一、英美兩國、海運發達、爲全球之冠、船舶噸位、均在千萬噸以上、固屬望塵莫及、而日椰德意法荷諸國、則在二百至四百萬噸之列、卽小如希瑞西丹等國、亦均有一百萬噸以上之商船、以我國版圖之廣、人口之多、與夫海岸綫之長、僅有此少數噸位、一經考査、實屬相形見絀、正宜籌謀擴展、加多噸位、以增國際地位、今於購船年齡、加以限制、無異作繭自縛、從此我國航業、必致日見退步、與提倡發皇之主旨相背、（二）我國造船廠無多、且其力量所能建造者、僅輕噸船舶、政府雖已公布造船獎勵條例、卽使命令施行、而核計現在造船時價、依照規定所得獎金、不及十分之一、故雖獎勵造船、實際仍難收效、是新船之建造、渺不可期、遽將購船年齡、加以限制、必致新船未造、舊船日少、航業益形减色、（三）我國爲條約所束縛、不能阻止外商輪船航行、現査外商在我國沿海長江所經營之航業、（五百噸以上船）英商太古有船六十五艘、計十六萬二千噸、怡和有船三十四艘、計九萬五千噸、日商日淸有船二十六艘、計五萬六千噸、合計三十一萬三千噸、僅三公司之噸量、已佔我國船舶數量四分之三、若再加英商賚賜、日商大連大阪等輪船而併算之、其噸位則超過我全國船舶數量矣、是其魄力之厚、競爭之烈、遠非我國所能及、設再將國人購船、加以限制、徒使外商乘機發展、增厚其勢力、（四）日本從前航業尙未發達之時、航商因謀擴充航務、競相購買他國舊船、政府並未加以限制、新近該國因造船事業發達、始有逐漸限制購買舊船之例、但該國航商、尙有借掛他國國旗、朦蔽營業之舊船、爲數達四十餘艘之多、限制之弊、可想而知、且査英美德法挪威等國、舊船艘數的佔三分之一以上者有之、佔半數者有之、亦未有禁購奮船命令、我國航業落後、情形更屬不同、倘不考察實情、遽行效法日本、限制舊船、等於削足就履、殊非適當之道、（五）船舶航行之安全、雖應注意船質、而允以駕駛之謹愼、管理之適宜、檢査之嚴密、設備之週到、修理之完善、爲最要關鍵、蓋新船航行、設遇颶風大霧或對方航行船舶、有錯駛航道、與因潮流激湍、而不諳避碰章程等情事、並非絕對可免危險之發生、至駕駛舊船者、苟能步步謹愼、熟諳航行技術、與臨危處斷、亦未必遽見失事、况現在航商購船、必先考察該船之船舶內容明細表、又須經過勞依氏或其他可靠之騐船專家、檢査水錢下鐵板及鍋爐等種種手續、駛入本國後、向航政局舉行登記時、必須技術人員之丈量、與持別檢査、方得准許航行、是舊船之安全問題、與新船實無差異、上述各點、均按事實而言、一經考察、卽可瞭然、限制購船年齡之不宜施於今日之航商也、彰彰明甚、現在鈞部命令、未准收回、章程不予修改、航商見聞深切、未便緘默不言、爰敢臚舉事實、再行陳情請願、乞賜體察、酌予變通、以期適當、而免阻礙、變通辦法有二、（一）分噸位之大小、作限制之範圍、先從二百噸以下之輪船實行限制、其二百噸以上之輪船、暫免施行、（二）視噸位之增額、定限制之時期、現在全國所有商船、不足五十萬噸、俟增至白萬噸時、實行限制、在增至七十五萬噸以上、未滿一百萬噸時、應照現在部令限制年齡各加十年、似此變通辦理、庶於鈞部命令不相違背、而航業困難、亦得顧全矣、</p>

<p>夫婦智識</p>
<p>— 德國醫學博士張君實</p>
<h3>增進夫婦愛情的原動力</h3>
<p>性生活為增進愛情消除膈膜的唯一途徑不可或缺　此種幸福惟有身强力壯者方能享受弱者速宜治療</p>
<p>夫婦生活將兩個生長於不同環境中的男女，拉攏在一起，過着最密切的生活。整天地混在一起，果然最能增長感情，郤也能以個性的不同，發生多量的衝突。感情增長的勢力，如較個性衝突的勢力大，夫婦的愛便日滋月長；反之，則時常反目爭吵，成為一對怨偶。這樣說來，要增進夫婦感情，永保和好，只有設法使衝突消滅於無形，增長促進事情的勢力一法。</p>
<p>怎樣能使感情增長的勢力比個性衝突的勢力大呢？這就要加强愛情的原動力。愛情的原動力，實際上卽係性生活。男女的結合，基礎在雙方對於性的需求；性欲能够滿足，愛情常受新的刺激，非但不致减弱，且能逐漸增加。</p>
<p>在性的享樂中，丟開了人世間一切的假面目，雙方各自沈醉覺到兩人的精神軀體，都化合為一，諒解彼此間一切的個性的歧異，衝突遂無從發生，夫婦生活中充滿了幸福。</p>
<p>可是這種幸福惟有身强力壯，性能健全的男女方能享受。性能薄弱的人們便無福消受了。每見少年男子，或先天不足。或少時耽溺於自凟手淫，生殖腺橫受摧殘，遺精，腎虧等症叢生。無法云滿足妻的欲望了。</p>
<p>女子中間也有類似的不幸者，以衰弱或手淫等故，性感薄弱，月經不調，對於性行為缺乏快感，不能和丈夫的熱情同時亢進。</p>
<p>長此以往，愛情沒有原動力云推進，决無增進之望；并致發生憎厭之念。不謀補救，勢將决裂。</p>
<p>男子的患者須急服『希米脫氏固精片』，使精關鞏固，可免遺精之患。再服生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』，使生殖腺健壯，發育機能恢復，性器可以發育長大，女子的患者則有女用生殖腺素製劑『女用生殖素』，能調整月經，恢復性感，使能營適當之性生活。</p>
<p>這樣療治後，性機能旣健全有力；全身强壯，亦得增强，所　時届冬令，不妨用為補品，必可一舉兩得。</p>

<h3>淋病患者之迷津寳筏</h3>
<p>— 美國本薛文尼大學醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>身患淋病的人，偶一不愼，即有遺禍終身的危險。急性淋雖痛苦較甚，治療郤反而容易；萬一殺菌未完，釀成慢性淋，痛苦很輕，然積久不愈，傳染妻子，這種苦痛郤要你够受哩。再則，病根一深，淋菌都深入體內，各種併發症陸續爆發。例如睪丸炎使睪丸炎腫脹疼痛，遷延不治，生育的機能也會消失。又如關節炎，手足動轉不靈，有成為殘疾的可能。又如女子的白帶，積久傷身，并礙生育，倘不愼將淋菌染入目中，有盲目的可能，其他併發症的名目尚多，總之，處處都有使患者一失足成千古恨的危險。</p>
<p>要避免這種危險，着手診療時，不可不愼於擇藥。擇藥以殺菌力之充足為第一義，次之則服用的便利和副作用的避免，皆不可不留意。</p>
<p>合於上述標準的藥，當推黃色素和伐克辛的合製劑『安敵淋』。黃色素有非常强大的殺菌力，無論潛伏得如何深，都能搜殺凈盡。伐克辛於同進使血液中產生抗毒素，淋菌要向體內逃去，也不可能。所以對於急性慢性淋病以及一爭併發症，均可同樣適用。</p>
<p>『安敵淋』係內服劑，故應用極便；無損腸胃，絕對不致發生任何副作用；故確為最合理想的良藥。</p>
<p>婦女患者宜兼用外用藥『療帶靈』，以止白帶，方可收功。</p>
<p>性的開明</p>
<p>— 詹念曾醫師</p>
<h3>防止手淫應早期實施性敎育</h3>
<p>在幼小時便應敎示珍重局部及闡述手淫之害　但欲偵察其人之是否犯上惡癖外觀亦可鑑定</p>
<p>假若做父母的不願兒女受到手淫之害的話，那末對於性敎育的灌輸實為當務之急。在發育時給與兒童以性的智識，不是十分適宜的事。寧是從幼小的時候，便敎示以生殖器官之珍重，及開導他關於手淫之毒害，使他澈底明瞭。此外要給他養成這樣的習慣：卽關於生殖器官而有疑義，便要無忌憚地坦白地向父母們陳述，因為生殖器官便非常容易不潔，而且容易罹於病症，所以在平時要十分地注意衛生之道，同時，在沒有必要的時候，是不能不避免濫行觸及那一部位的。</p>
<p>這樣一來，自然就要新生該部，在發生何等異常的時候，便知有所抑制，所以，便能够預防此種惡癖，知曉疾病，而防性的失策於未然了。</p>
<p>抑有一說：手淫行為因為從幼小的時期便極度廣汎地流行着，所以對於一般兒童，不能不親察是否在實行手淫。而且因為手淫幾乎全是在秘密裏進行，所以此種觀察，是很不容易的。</p>
<p>然而，此種說法，雖也有其理由。但是我們尚可獲得外觀的症候，如面色蒼白，常苦惱於憂愁與恐怖，夜眠不安，神經衰弱。那末照上述的幾點外表，就可以鑑別他是否曾有手淫癖。</p>
<p>若考察到手淫行為所及於性力上的影響，那末，幼時行之，能使性器的發育受阻，遺精頻繁，結果，使內分泌枯竭，而致在日後度入了結婚生活之後，發生種種障碍，如屬女性者，能引起月經紊亂，子宮障碍，儘有許多不姙的原因完全由此。因此之故，對於手淫的疾病，治療應早。若患遺精，可以『希米脫氏固精片』治之，短期卽愈。若罹腎虧，局部發育受阻及種種的神經衰弱症者，最佳而又極端有效的治法，應以生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』服之。因其確具促進新陳代謝的能力，百樣性病，無不對症。</p>

<h3>詹念曾醫師編撰</h3>
<p>（診所）四川路北京路轉角中國信託公司二樓　門診上午十時至下午六時。星期日休息。</p>
<p>（一）早婚不育病在腎虧</p>
<p>患者無上勤耕，年廿五歲，福建厦門人，在滬經營茶業，已歷十載，住居於天瀛路鑫順里。（主訴）—本人先天素强惟因早婚之故，婚後之體魄較婚前衰弱。十六歲卽發育，同年卽奉父命舉行婚禮，年靑無知，縱慾過度，加之剛發育之身體，受此摧殘，日漸衰退。婚後六月，性能漸感衰弱，腎虧，間有遺精，雖曾屢加治療，無澈底治愈之望，故婚後十年，尚無子嗣，父母為我早娶之故，無非抱孫心切，今者適得其反，目所患有增劇之勢，今夏乃自來求治。（診時病狀）—腎虧之外，且局部發育亦不美滿，每星期有遺精二三次，面色蒼白，精枯，腦弱。（治療之法）—每日施行電療一次，服『希米脫氏固精片』根治遺精，並為之鞏固精關，診得趙君之腎虧及發育不全症，完全由於早婚斵喪，以致生殖腺蒙害過甚。乃得用生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』治之。每日分三次吞服，每次二片，使其衰弱之生殖腺轉弱為强，則性能可澈底復恢强壯，局部的發育亦可轉佳，內分泌亦可旺盛，精强，腦足，生育可期。經過不到兩月，果然勃起力異常堅强，且覺精力充足，發育轉佳，至今彼之夫人業已姙娠三月矣。</p>
<p>（二）手淫過度遺精失眠</p>
<p>患者曹毓靈，年廿四歲，杭州人。（主訴）—十歲時卽犯手淫，躭溺過度，精力損喪。旋卽遺精頻繁，耳鳴，頭痛，健忘，失眠等症俱全，致身體衰弱不堪面容蒼白，肌肉削瘦，上月初自來求治。（診時病狀）—遺精每星期至少四次，入夜失眠，遺精。白晝精神萎頓，四肢乏力。（治療之法）—診得曹君受手淫之害，致精關弛鬆，遺精頻繁，乃囑服『希米脫氏固精片』治其遺精，同時投以生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』治其種種神經衰弱症，治療約三星期左右，遺精卽止，經過不到兩月，失眠，頭痛等症盡消，面色亦紅潤矣。</p>
<p>戒煙常識</p>
<h3>戒除煙癮後的我</h3>
<p>— 馮新生</p>
<p>編輯先生：自今夏戒除煙癮以後，眞像所謂的洗面革心，我竟重新做了個健全的人。精神肉體，都感到空前的愉快。心中得意非凡，這都是貴刋介紹靈藥『生殖素』之賜，故特專函申謝，并略叙個人戒除的經過，以為同病者吿。</p>
<p>我自十九歲時為損友所誘，染得嗜好，以後耽溺忘返，吸食幾二十年。年未四十，已容顏蒼老，傴僂曲背，瘦弱不堪，加以滿面煙容，言之殊為痛心。我素服務商界，時需出外奔波。雖則路程不遠，尚可設法支持，然而上下舟車，常遭軍警搜查，這無非是煙容在惹人注目。</p>
<p>這樣已經够受累了，加以我素心好勝，常聞人家冷言譏誚風氣大盛時，我也不顧身體的孱弱，决心戒除。可是乏人指導，誤服雜藥，竟大感痛苦，遂遭失敗。於是悉心訪問，始得同業關君轉吿貴刋介紹，購服『生殖素』，連服了六個星期，不知不覺之中，一點痛苦也沒有受，二十年宿癮竟和我脫離了關係。并且身體較前康强，四肢有力，煙容盡脫，精神烱烱，親友見者無不驚異。（下略）</p>
<p>編者按：『生殖素』功能增强生殖腺，使生命泉源豐富，供給全身各部份以充足的活力。所以服用五六星期後，雖飽受煙毒摧殘，已趨麻醉的細胞也能重獲振作，不必雅片的刺激，卽能照常運動，故精力旺盛，足以抵抗煙毒戒時身體不受任何影響。</p>
<h3>胃痛陣作</h3>
<p>詹念曾醫師：</p>
<p>敝人胃臟有病，時覺陣痛頻發，同時胃口亦不佳，因此食慾大减，雖服藥多種，未能治根，旋見報載『胃痛靈』可止胃痛，『健胃素』能助消化乃各購一盒，服後頻覺疼痛立止，消化轉佳，用敢介紹。（胡思漢）</p>
<h3>白帶奇臭</h3>
<p>詹大醫師：</p>
<p>余妻不知何故，帶下甚劇，且發奇臭，雖余為之遍訪著名婦科專家求治，總難根治，旋同居菊高女士介紹余妻用『療帶靈』治之之後，不旬日帶竟根止，至今未發，余鑒於藥之靈騐，為特錄出以供婦女界之採用（陳志國）</p>
<h3>乳峯高聳</h3>
<p>詹大醫師：</p>
<p>敝人乳峯素所萎癟，各部發育均不佳良，雖多方求治，並曾數度就商於美容院，然總不能使余滿意，今夏幸得同學指導服以生殖腺女用製劑『生殖素』之後，始得轉佳，至今兩月，已豐腴高聳，頗具健美型態矣（錢文進）</p>
<h3>冬令進補</h3>
<p>詹先生：</p>
<p>余每年一入冬季，必求補品，蓋敝人體素積弱而又多病，以前曾服燕窩，人參，桂圓之類，苦於無甚大效，上年起乃以生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』補之，今年自春至今，身體之佳，面色紅潤，為余數年來所僅見，據醫云：由於『生殖素』能促進新陳代謝的機能之故。（俞永先）</p>
<p>女性的美容與生育</p>
<h3>健美為姙娠之先聲</h3>
<p>— 香港大學醫科學士吳大超</p>
<p>不孝有三，無後為大，這是我國的舊觀念，多事生育以繁殖國家的人口，這是現代的新觀念。二者都一致指出生育的重要，可知傳種接代確為男女結合後應負的　責任，婦女們如不幸而患了不姙症，亟宜謀自救之道。</p>
<p>姙娠與生殖腺有直接的關係，所以不姙的原因恒不外於生殖腺的萎弱。大抵生殖腺萎弱之人，恒有數種共同的徵象，所以凡有那些徵象的女子，均有不育的可能。月經運行期雜亂不準確，白帶大下，皆係內分泌錯亂的鐵證。最容易看到的病狀當推身體瘦弱，發育不良。這些婦女絕沒有丯腴滑潤的皮膚，也沒有隆然高聳惹異性注目的乳峯，更沒有嘻笑活潑的可愛的姿態，旣患絕育之症，又喪失了美觀，確是極可悲哀的。</p>
<p>補救之道，首應服用女性生殖腺素製劑「女用生殖素，」這是斯丹那博士採取了健壯的雌性動物的生殖腺素精華而製成的。能使萎弱的生殖腺，立變壯健，內分泌旺盛，發育亢進；不消幾時，經期即得準確；鳳膚立呈紅潤結實；乳房自平坦化為高聳，飽含彈性。此外更外用「療帶靈」為坐藥，以淸凈　道，驅除白帶。那麽一改故態，變為健壯美麗的女子，生育的障礙去，姙娠可以有望了。</p>
<p>自療常識</p>
<h3>寒冬對於骨痛患者的威脅</h3>
<p>— 俞伯符醫師</p>
<p>嚴寒的冬天，確為病家所憂慮。據醫學的立塲觀察，骨痛患者所受的影響為尤甚。每有患者在此寒冬不僅疼痛加甚，且因抵抗力之孱弱，甚至四枝拘攣，麻木異常。抑有進者，素受瘋濕掃襲之人，平時因為抵抗力尚能與之相持，故得避免骨節酸痛之苦，然一入冬令，因氣候酷寒，一切陷於衰頹之狀，抵抗力亦為之削弱。因此之故，瘋濕之侵害，遂致肆無忌憚，到處破壞，結果腰背酸痛，骨節麻木，種種症狀，相繼爆發，故於此時實為骨痛者最受威脅之時。可是防衛得法，不僅可使骨痛可以避免，而且已罹患者亦可澈底根治。余屢加試騐，不爽毫釐，此法當平時感有精力不足者，應於冬初速服生殖腺素造劑『生殖素』以補體力，使身體的抵抗力不受時令的變遷而失調，同時當服以功能袪瘋，除濕，淸血，及預防動脈硬化功能的『强斯登氏骨痛片』，則患者定可骨節輕鬆，疼痛全消。</p>

<h3>精彩出乎意外　曁南祗差三分　二十六比二十九分敗於信通　最後四分鐘勝負尙捉摸不定</h3>
<p>西靑籃球獨立組、曁南對信通、昨晚劇戰之結束、曁南不幸以三分之差、爲信通所敗、二十六比二十九分、上半時曁南以十四比十二佔先兩分、曁南雖敗、表演之精彩、實有出人意料之外、信通猛烈抗戰、直至最後之四分鐘、才超出曁南之上、而在最後之四分鐘中、互以一分相上下者久之、憑別塞爾卡爾生之兩罰一中、信通才能以廿九比二十六多三分得勝、其中經過之千辛萬苦、亦可相見、勝來殊不容易也、在曁南言、昨晚大有得勝之機會、最多時曾佔先八分之多、其中皆以一失手之疏忽、遂讓信通乘機而上、王南珍表演卓絕、中鋒鄺耀雅罰出、在最後之關頭、亦爲　命之傷、西靑上下客滿、臨了之數分鐘、變化萬端、咸坐立不安、一時緊張之至、將來第二循環中、希望暨南有以報復、另一塲辛隊勝麥令乙、四十比十七、上半時各得十五、亦爲獨立組之一幕，</p>
<p>守衛嚴密　南昨晚能得此結果者、其銅牆鐵壁式之嚴密守衛、有以致此、信通五賊、在上半時、竟走頭無路、無從發展、史規亞蘭姆根兩人始終未開擲中之紀錄、後以卡遜自後襲取、蘭茵苦守籃下、想盡方法、信通才得破曁南之陣、暨南除守衛嚴密、毫無放鬆之外、竟令信通罕有投籃之機會進攻上亦採穩紮穩打之方法、惟在上半時中、不少擲籃之會機皆射而不中、亦爲極可惜之事、罰球亦全部失敗、其間在分數上出入甚鉅、亦不無影響勝負也、</p>
<p>黃金時代開賽後、蘭茵以兩罰兩中，先開紀錄、尹責仁遝奉一球、蘭茵韓振元又相互中的、成各四之極緊張局面、蔡演雄王南珍各中一球、曁南頓以八比四佔先、一時呼聲大起、尹貴仁鄺耀雅蔡演雄、又各建一功、曁南驟以十四比六壓倒信通、其聲勢之盛、一時無兩、此實爲曁南之黃金時代、時距上半時結束、祇有二分鐘、曁南果能保持之優異局面、在下半時中、亦較易爲力、惜乎一失手之間、別塞爾史規亞卡爾去、在第罰連中之中、一氣連得六分、上半時遂被信通追成十四比十二、曁南僅多一分而已、</p>
<p>信通居上上半時經此劇戰、暨南之體力、已爲觀衆所關心、王南珍雖上塲卽得二分、但長人萊茵、二中一罰、連加五分、信通初决以十七比十六超出、所可憂者、中鋒鄺耀雅已記上三决犯規之紀錄、不二分鐘、果以第四次之犯規罰出、以顏連進補進、王南珍改跳中鋒、卡遜之輩、遂得連得六分、第二次以二十一比十八分躍居曁南之上、</p>
<p>最後苦鬥其時距完局僅四分鐘、而最緊張之局面、亦於此四分鐘內開始演出、曁南落後三分後、猛烈反攻、王南珍二决遠射、竟二决中的、復以二十二比二十一、再佔上風、信通呌息後、長人開始站立暨南　下、回首間、　被其中、然王南珍奮不顧身、第三次之遠射、又入信通之網、仍成二十　比二十三、長人籃下之第二拋、又被命中、加以別塞爾猛銜中的、信通方以二十七比二十　多得三分、尹貴仁雖急急奪回二分、惜乎在最後之數十秒中、卡遜又罰得　分、造就二十九比十六之最後結局、</p>

<h3>岳飛的少年時代</h3>
<p>— 李季珍</p>
<p>—他未曾有一天忘記要做「忠孝雙全」的好人—</p>
<p>岳武穆以宋徽宗崇寗二年（紀元二〇三年）二月十五日生於河南相州府湯陰縣。父親名和，是一位名士，他常說。「一個人雖然不幸生於亂世，做一個無權無勇的匹夫，但是千萬不可不以國家爲念，只求苟安。許多人誤解孔明先生的「苟全性命於亂世，不求聞達於諸侯」，以爲生於亂世能够不死已算福，何必過分貪圖進取呢？其實孔明先生的「苟全是在做磨礪道德學問的工夫，等到道德學問成熟，碰着機會就出來做救國救民的事業。你看他一出草廬，文才武略那一樣不成熟？就可見得他在草廬的時候，不但不「苟」，並且非常用功。我的志願是要學孔明先生。」因此岳和非常努力，一天不是學文就是習武。他眼見朝中君暗臣奸，知道難像孔明一般，得遇明主。他却仍然不肯灰心，打算自己如不得志，便把所學傳給兒子，兒子又傳給孫子，代代相傳，他相信他的安邦定國的志願和才幹終竟是有實現的一日的。他又想，「要想得好子孫，單靠我一個人是不成的，我一定要找一個好妻子。」他很耐心的去選擇，結果　得到一個美慧而又賢淑的姚姓女子爲妻。</p>
<p>這對賢夫婦，合在一起，非常相得。岳和上無尊親，下無兒女，夫人又儉的，家用很省。他有良田千畝，年中收入，大半拿來周恤鄉里中的貧困的人。他們樂得家庭小，一來可以省錢，養成廉儉之風；二來可以省事，讓夫人能够分出一半理家的時間和他一塊誦讀經史。</p>
<p>這樣快樂而有意義的日子過得特別快，轉眼已經十年。武穆就在岳和夫婦婚後十週年紀念日出世，那時岳和已經四十，夫入也快三十了。他們多年所盼望的小寶貝果然得到，快樂得眞非言語可能形容。他們深信如果敎養得宜，這塊美玉準會成器的，他們把希望全托在兒子身上，盡心竭力的來敎導他。他們想替他取一個顧名思義的好名字，熟思了三天也想不出來。恰好到了三朝，循例要舉行「湯餅會」。岳和因爲十年來的仁俠好施，已變作一貧如洗，心中却又很想借着這「湯餅會」請鄰里的窮入飽餐一頓，那天破曉就起來，跑到十里外問他的好友周同借錢。從他家到周家，如走大路，半日還不能到，如走山路，可以省却大半的時間。因他怕誤了請客的時刻，寗願辛苦些走山路。他一面走，一面想着要替兒子取個名字。走到山嶺上，天忽然全黑起來，利風刺骨，寒不能耐。岳和驚嚷道：「現在是仲春時節，卽使天要下雨，也不能有這樣的寒風，這是什麼災異呢？過了一會，忽然又變了天朗氣淸，鶯鳴柳下，蝶舞花前，好美的風景！也很奇怪，伸長脖子四圍一望，看見遠遠有一個遮天蔽日的大鳥飛過，氣勢雄武，是非常偉大的壯觀。因此他决定呌他的愛子做　飛」。</p>
<p>錢借到手，他回來把他的所見和取名的經過吿訴夫人，夫人很歡喜的說道：「我記得小寳寳快要出世的時候，屋頂有很雄壯的聲音，我請你去看看是什麼一回事，你說只看見遠遠一個大鳥飛過，什麽也沒有。話才說完，我的肚子就痛了。今天你所見的，說不定就是前天那一個。牠是什　呢？難道就是莊子所說的大鵬嗎？好不好我們替他多取一個字呌做「鵬舉」呢？」岳和聽了，十分贊成。</p>
<p>岳夫人的娘家在河北大名府內　縣，本來是富有的書香人家，近年中落了，家裏有一個老娘和一個弟弟，靠着種田過日子。岳飛差兩天滿月的時候，娘家派人來接她回家，說老太太想他成病了，要她回內黃省親去。岳夫人是一個孝順的女兒，聽見母親病了，恨不得揷一雙翼飛回家服侍母親去。岳和很和她表同情，呌她帶着兒子和來人先兩天走，他要把兒子的、滿月做完才能離家，因他已經的好了許多遠路的親友到滿月那天來吃喜酒，現在來不及一個個去推辭，只得自己留在家中招待。岳夫人回到娘家，老太太看見久別的女兒和新生的外孫，非常歡喜，病不覺好了許多。</p>
<p>那天她娘兒倆高高興興談到更深，不想夜半內黃大水，全縣變成澤國。岳夫人的弟弟蹌踉進來對她說道：「姊姊，大水來了，我還要照顧老人家，你自己想法子避難罷，我也顧不得你了。」他一面說，一面把母親背起來走向高處去。岳夫人忙抱起岳飛，出門找生路。水越升超高，一會兒浸沒了大腿。岳夫人不知道怎樣才好，忽然摸着身旁有一個浮起的大水缸，她竟不思索地坐入缸裏，雙手緊緊抱着岳飛，側耳聽着四圍的飛聲和水聲，夾着遠近難民的呼娘呌子。水缸順水衝到岸上，岳夫人娘兒居然不死。天明水退，入家見了他們，誰也說是一件奇事。岳夫人的母親和弟弟都幸得生存，娘兒姊弟相見非常驚喜。岳和聽見大水的消息立卽趕來，把外家都接到湯陰去。第二天是岳飛的滿月，各入一面滴着痛定思痛的眼淚，一面喝着骨肉團圓的喜酒。</p>
<p>時光很快過了幾年，岳夫人的母親和弟弟早已回了內黃、岳飛這孩子長成乖覺無比。岳和夫婦雖然很喜歡他，因爲望他成材，不肯姑息溺愛。岳飛四歲，父親就呌他到書齋去攻讀。岳飛又聰明又肯用功，才十二歲已經把四書，五經和史子百家全讀完了。此時，岳和力耕僅能糊口。岳飛每天到田間送飯，看見父親蓐草犂田，汗下如雨，辛苦非常，他便要留在田間替父親工作。父親因他年少，又怕躭誤了他讀書的時間，每回都是以溫言好話騙他，說耕田是最有趣而又是最不辛苦的工作。他明白父親的意思，不敢和父親爭執，只得含着眼淚回來。到家又怕母親看出他的愁容，擦乾眼淚才敢進屋裏去。但他總覺做兒子不能養親是恥辱和難堪的事。</p>
<p>有一天，他坐在書齋裏，又想起他父親在田裏做工很苦，他看見面前堆滿的書，不覺嘆　，「做兒子不能養親，　書萬卷有什麼用呢？」　起古人所說：「其父析薪，其子不克負荷。」不覺失聲哭將起來。</p>
<p>岳夫人是一個聰明人，雖然岳飛不敢在她的面前露出不如意的辭色，她却已看出岳飛的心事。她只不說出來，一面留心偵察她的見子的舉動。那天在屋裏補縫衣服，忽聽見兒子的哭聲，忙把針綫放下來，到書齋來看是什麽回事。岳飛看見母親，知道無法遮掩，不覺跪了下來，岳夫人忙扶他起來，拿衣袖替他擦乾眼淚，柔聲問道：　「我兒－你小小年紀，有什麽不如意事？可以吿訴娘嗎？」</p>
<p>岳飛聽見母親的話，忍不住又哭了起來，過了一會，他才斷斷續續的說：「娘－我……我每天到田裏送爸爸的飯，看見……看見他工作太辛苦，我捨不得讓爸爸這樣受苦，要替他工作，可是他……他不許我幹，所以我不好過。但我還不懂得我是一個不孝的人，剛纔想起古人所說「其父析薪，其子不克負荷。」我就知道我不孝，因爲爸爸耕田，我不做事，還不是不孝嗎？我最恨不孝不忠的人，你呌我怎不痛恨自己呢？」說到這裏又哭起來，隨哭隨說道：「娘－我不願做不孝的兒子，你替我想個主意罷！」</p>
<p>岳夫人聽見兒子的話，悲喜交集，悲的是因爲家貧，勞壞了丈夫，愁壞了兒子；喜的是，這樣小小年紀的兒子，居然這樣有孝心，會念書，又懂得做人。她雖然愛惜岳飛的身體，但是她更喜歡岳飛的美德，她要成全他做一個孝子。就對岳飛說：</p>
<p>「我兒，起來罷！娘代你想到主意了。不錯，「其父析薪，其子不克負荷。是爲不孝。不過你的年紀還小呢。你旣然定要帮助你爸爸，等娘吿訴他，請他讓你到田裏做工就是了。</p>
<p>第一天岳飛就去種田。他又熱心，又賣氣力，工作得比誰都好。最初還要父親敎他，後來他一切能獨力幹去。他、白天做工，晚上讀書，時光一些都不荒廢。他沒有錢買膏火，就去野地裏檢些柴草，晚上在院子裏燒起來，坐在柴堆前念書。夏天他也這樣幹，柴烟薰黑了口臉，汗水　衣服都濕透了，等到天亮才盥洗乾凈。鄉裏人都稱讚他，說他才是一個力學的孝子。有一位李員外喜歡岳飛把一個獨生女兒嫁給他做媳婦。</p>
<p>岳飛不覺長成十八歲了，學問，品行，都有驚人的進步。他非常沈厚，很少說話。可是看見他那種端正肅穆的態度，誰也曉得他是一個有氣節的孩子。他因爲肯勢動，所以氣力很大，能挽强弓，拉勁弩，他喜歡博覽羣書，其中最喜讀的是左氏春秋和孫吳兵法。</p>
<p>那年秋收完了，因爲是個覺年，田家却在一處慶祝。岳和夫婦被鄰家邀請吃酒去剩下岳飛和媳婦看守家裏。岳飛送父母到了鄰家，回來把竹籬的門掩着，在院子裏拉拉弓，學一回射箭，換過衣服，背着陽光坐在草地上大聲念孫子兵法。</p>
<p>不想他父親的好友周同這正來拜訪。周同是陜西的名士，能文能武，並且有善射的神技。因爲他的獨子征遼死在邊疆，他太傷心，在故土住不下去，特地跑到河南湯陰來作個隱士。他很少交遊，獨喜歡岳和的豪俠好義。岳飛五歲那年，他離開湯陰，雲遊四方。他曉得岳飛是一個非常的人，浪遊了十三年之後，終竟要回湯陰來看看這個聰明的孩子。十三年來，岳家莊的一切都改了樣子，他臨走時小小的綠楊，現在已長成合抱；瞪着眼愛看生客的小孩兒還是前前後後的跟着他，可是一個個不是從前的面孔；他記得離這裏不遠就是岳家，正在要找一個問道的人，忽然聽見前頭不遠有淸脆的書聲非常悅耳，他聽得出來這是少年的口音，聽他念的是孫子。他想，「誰家生這樣有出息的孩子，敢情是將門之子？」他跟着書聲走到竹籬前，認得這裏就是岳家。他剛想叩門，狗聲已經把岳飛驚起。岳飛看見籬門外站着一位英偉慈詳的老人，他忙把門開了，揖請這位長者進來。恭恭敬敬的請敎尊姓大名，才曉得這是他父親的好友周同，不遠千里到來訪間。他忙到鄰家告知父親。好友重逢，各人心中都無限歡喜。</p>
<p>周同非常器重岳飛，定要把他的才學和射箭的神技傳授給他。岳和曉得周同是一代大師，生怕錯過了機會，馬上命兒子前來拜他爲師。都天晚上岳家大排筵席和周同洗塵，第二天周同便開始敎授。</p>
<p>那時周同已經上了年紀，他曉得自己憂傷半生，不會長壽；怕自己的學問失傳，日日夜夜的盡心敎授他的徒弟。岳飛也非常敬愛他的老師，老師吩咐他怎樣幹他就怎樣幹。他心堅神足，身體又結實，整天用腦用力都不覺累，愈學愈有勁，學了兩年射，能挽三百斤的强弓，發八石勁弩。他全學會了周同的技巧，能左右射。岳飛戚激周同這樣苦心敎他，又可憐他老年無子，存心以父親之禮侍奉他，使他的晚年安安樂樂的過日子。不想周同並未受岳飛一點報答，病了幾天就死去了。</p>
<p>岳飛抱着他的恩師的尸首，呼天搶地的痛哭。他把周同葬在本鄉，以便常來掃墓。他拿起書就想起他的先生，常常對書長嘆；挽着弓就想起他的敎師，忍不住淚隨弩發。每逢初一十五他必定到周同的墓前拜祭，風雨不改期。岳和看見他這麽義氣，不覺讚賞他道：</p>
<p>「兒！假如你有一天爲世所用，你一定是一個殉國死義的人。」</p>
<p>岳飛聽了，半嚮說不出話來。他父親又道：</p>
<p>「兒呀，國難一天一天的厲害，父親年老了，救國救民的希望都寄在兒的身上。古今忠臣義士並不少人。兒呀，我盼望你做最純全的一個。」</p>
<p>岳飛說：「爸，我永遠記着你今天的敎訓，我一定要做最純全的一個。」</p>
<p>那時宋國的金驅遼的外交政策，變做引狼入室了。金人攻取了燕京，不但不肯守的把失地歸還，並且打算侵犯宋國。徽宗皇帝是一個不中用的人，只求自己一個人縱情快樂，什麼外交國事一槪不懂，弄到外難和內亂都發作起來，找不出收拾的方法。岳和知道這是義士立功報國的時候，有心呌岳飛從軍去，於是他趁機會對岳飛說道：「兒，你想救國救民，現在就是機會了，你去投軍吧？」</p>
<p>岳飛是有志投軍的，但怕父母在家無人奉養，躊躊躇躇馬上不敢答應。幸虧父親曉得他不能决志的理由，忙對他說道：「兒，救國比事親重要得多，救國和事親是二而一的事，亡了國家雙親便失了寄托，單講事親有什麽用處？何况目前我們並不是非你在身跟不行，家裏的餘糧節省些可以支持一年，晨昏定省又有媳婦代替你。兒，你决定去罷！」</p>
<p>恰好此時眞定劉宣撫招募戰士，岳飛禀過父母應募去了。岳飛到了營裏就接到勦匪的命令，他帶一百兵滅了相州兩個擁衆萬人的大賊。上司正要重用他，不想接到父親病重的信，他什麽也不顧趕回家裏來。岳和已經病到沉重極了，臉色變了灰白，躺在床上，四肢全不會動彈，頭向着屋外，雙眼睜得大大，像等着什麽似的。他聽見岳飛回來，頭忽然會舉起來，伸手要人把他扶起。家裏的人正欣幸他的病有了好的轉機，誰知道他只能說一句「兒你回來了！」便倒　來死了。岳飛和母親抱着屍首，哭得死去活來。岳飛怕傷心壞了母親，忍着眼淚一面勸解，一面經營後事。過了一百天，喪事遵禮辦完了。</p>
<p>那時岳飛已經二十歲了，他什麽都不自專。一切都禀命於慈母。岳夫人准他在家裏守制，每天往田裏做半天工夫，其餘的時間在家習武和溫經史。岳飛念念不忘父親最後的敎言，立志要完成父親未完之志。他常常想道：「我聽說「古人求忠臣於孝子之門」，未做純忠的臣應該先做純孝的子。」他本來是一個天性至孝的人，現在更立心要這純全的境地。遠近的邪人惡子，聽見他的善行而改過的不知有多少。</p>
<p>那時逆賊楊么在湖廣作亂，他聽見人說岳飛是一個英才，很想招致。他卑詞厚禮使人到湯陰去聘岳飛，岳飛嚴詞正色把來人斥去，回去又把一切經過吿訴岳夫入，並且痛哭流涕跪在母親的膝別說道：</p>
<p>「娘！孩兒從小受着雙親的敎訓，未曾有一天忘記要做「忠孝雙全」的好人。這顆光明磊落的心，我想誰也應體諒。兒不明白今日居然有人敢招兒做叛國逆親的賊子，難道孩兒做錯了什麽事，才招人輕視麼？</p>
<p>「我兒，你不要傷心，也不要過於自鄙，你今日所吃的虧，就是聖入也避小了。你唯有立志更加堅定，做人更加小心，邪入看見你的堅貞，自然不敢來侵犯你。」岳夫人說到這裏，忽然想出一個法子，呌　兒子心志堅定。她吩咐岳飛拏香案來，燒着香燭，呌岳飛脫去上衣很敬虔的對天跪着。她拔出頭上一枝小銀簪，在岳飛的背上刺了四個「精忠報國　的字。她一面刺字一面吿訴她的兒子道</p>
<p>「兒呀！娘上了年紀，說不定早晚要離開你，國亂歹人多，少年人最容易上當。我怕我一撤手你便忘記了你的家敎，跟人學壞了，因此在你的背上刺「精忠報國」四個字，讓你永遠記得娘的敎言，負起「精忠報國」的責任。一</p>
<p>他們的精誠支配了一切，所以慈母忍得刺背，兒子又不覺得一些痛苦。</p>
<p>後來岳飛投軍，打破金兵，挽救了將亡的宋國。他因爲要過到「純全」和「精忠」，結果捨身報國。他所以有這樣的大才和至德，全靠他少時的好敎養。</p>

<h3>「教育播音講演集」</h3>
<p>— 英夫</p>
<p>第一輯　民衆教育篇</p>
<p>敎育部主辦的敎育播昔講演，已經於二十四年十月開始舉行。這種講演分爲二方面：一方面是關於中等敎育的，另一方面是關於民衆敎育的。兩者都已同時舉行，一直至去年寒假。始吿暫停。這里，我們現在所要介紹的敎育播音講演集第一輯（中等敎育篇）就是去年由敎育部所舉行的敎育播音講演，第一方面的演詞；由該部編輯，新近由商務印書館印行的。</p>
<p>關於敎育部主辦敎育講演的動機和經過，已經有敎育部長在第一次講演裏說明過了，我們沒有重複述及之必要。這里所要講的，便是：我們在讀過道本講演集之後，所發生的一點感想。首先，談談演詞的分類吧。該講演集的內容共分四項，爲：（一）靑年訓練：（二）學科講演；（三）敎育講演；（四）時事講演。像這樣的材斜支配法，從上述的　項項目來說，是沒有什麽不對的。不過，我們所認爲小不滿的，便是：在四　項目之下，演詞的，量的支配一點。譬如：第一類靑年訓練的演詞，本來依照中等學生的需要來說，是應該特別注重的，其篇幅至少應佔全集之半，或三分之一；但是，事際上却只得四篇，和其他類的演詞比較起來，只占有最小的地位。如：第二類學科購演的演詞，本來是次第一類的，但是，事際上却佔有十八篇之多。這種村料是支配的不得當，當然不能由編輯者負責的；而是應該由主辦敎育播音講演的機關負責的，換句話來說，敎育剖對於講演材料的支配，是應該注重靑年訓練一類，或者把該類和學科講演並重亦可。再者，在內容的分量上，還有一點小缺點，便是：材料的遺漏。如：在靑年訓練一類裏，是應該有一篇關於學生運動的講演；把該運動的意義。歷史。過夫的錯誤。及現在應走的軌道等一一解釋得明瞭。又如：學潮也是頗重要的問題，應該有名敎育家的講演，對學校和學生給一種正確的解答。又如：敎育　演類裏，只有一篇講演涉及了師範生服務問題；而對一般中等學校畢業生的，升學和就業，失業的問題，却不曾有一篇講演提到過。這些，都是我們所認爲的美中不足之點。</p>
<p>其次，讓我們來談談　本講演集內容的質一方面吧。在這一方面，是找不出一點不滿的地方；全集所收三　四篇講演，可說都有其卓超向正確的見地，不是對中等學生的修麥有所指示，便是對其學業有所輔助，對其常識有所擴充。這是我們認爲最有利於他們的：從道一點，便可以肯定：去年所舉行的敎育講演，其成績是很美滿的，其效力是很　大的</p>
<p>現在，且舉出兩篇講演的優點，來　實上面的好評吧。如：羅家倫所講的現代靑年修學養的要素，其主張是頗卓越而正確的。他提出了三種要　，爲現代靑年修養所必具的；卽是：（一）科舉家求知的精神；（二）軍人的生活習慣；（三）運動家的競賽道德。並且，進一步把第二種要素分爲四點，卽是（未完</p>

<h3>一個西崽的死</h3>

<p>西崽在上海雖是一個大衆化的名辭，但幷不因大衆化而减少它的卑賤，因爲呌別人做西崽的人，在呌的時候，自己就有一種高貴的神氣；而西崽呢，也往往聽得一聲呼喚就連忙恭而敬之地喊一聲「也司，馬司脫」！這情形特別是在洋行裏或一些高貴的西人住宅中，他們的喜歡用中國僕人，大抵是喜歡他們那種馴服的神氣，和那一聲恭恭敬敬地，也司，馬司脫！」</p>
<p>不過身份一卑賤了，人格似乎也就不能提高，理由是很簡單的，高貴的人做高貴的事，而卑賤者呢，自然是下流了。這倒也不是他們性之所近，其實是高貴的人們的堅壁淸野主義在作怪，在西崽　主人之間，顯然劃下了一道極大的鴻溝，在西崽這一邊的，大抵是「下流，卑汚」，而在主人那一面呢，又總是「道義」等等。這也是可以舉例證明的：</p>
<p>「本地人陳堯生，在某西人家爲西崽，前日因該西人失去電爐一只，疑陳所竊，幷將陳停歇，陳卽服毒自殺。發覺後，車送醫院醫治無效，當卽氣絕斃命……法院檢察官檢得陳堯生委係生前服毒身死，着家屬收殮云。」</p>
<p>當然咯，在西人眼光中，區區一西崽的服毒，是不及莎翁大悲劇「羅密歐與朱麗葉」中羅密歐的服毒來得刺激的，而且，自殺又是弱者的行動，就述同情也是不必寄與的，他不把「天良發現羞憤致死」等名詞加在陳堯生頭上，已經是够感激的了。</p>
<p>我們雖然不主張自殺，但因陳堯生之死，却不能無感，這「感」就發生在西崽以及西崽卑賤的業務上。西崽大抵是沒有多少知識的，這也是事實；不過沒有知識的人，却並不一定就是下流，這也是事實中的事實。而且正因爲他們腦筋的簡單，他們在這虛僞狡詐的社會裏，還保存一點天眞，這一點天眞，使他們在行動上給「知識份子」以不少可笑的資料。例如被誣作賊，這是沒有自殺的理由的，如果設身處地來想，假定失掉東西的（當然不是電爐）是西崽，而被疑作賊的是那個主人，那末，主人如果不是「哈哈」一笑置之，便是伸出巨靈之掌賞以耳光兩個，而且社會上的旁覜者也會表示正義感似地一齊出來說話：</p>
<p>「他那裏會作賊，怕是你窮極無聊來誣攀吧！」</p>
<p>在這種情形之下，主入如果眞的喜歡偸東西，他的高帽與大禮服仍然受人尊敬。可憐的陳堯生，他沒有知道這些，更沒有知道在這個社會上越是上流入士越要幹偸竊的勾當，不但幹了之後，假面具無人戳穿，卽使戳穿了，仍然笑罵由他笑罵，紳士我自爲之。好在社會上一些所謂有「正義感」的人士，大都是和這些「紳士」一起的，他們看到紳士的面具將要戳穿的時候，會一致起來替他遮掩，因爲他們知道唇亡齒寒，而且也還怕兎死狐悲的。</p>
<h3>楊家港</h3>
<p>— 允海</p>
<p>秋天。沒有滔天大浪，海面堆不起大山，遠望看來，似乎只有小浪兒追逐着戲要，倒怪惹人愛的。</p>
<p>三兩隻牙鷹在半空中翱翔，兩片肥厚的翅膀，像和着節拍那麼地蠻勁的舞動着，時高時下的把整個碧緣的天空點綴得平和面且柔美。當牠那尖銳敏覺的眼瞳裏發現了那追逐着三五成羣的魚踪時，鋼般硬的嘴吧朝下一擺，身體的重量又失了均衡，劈拍劈拍地有那末快便那末快地飛了下來，一個　蜓點水，在水面下輕輕一喙，攫中了，才又一轉頭，吱－的便直衝雲霄。這樣的飛翔非常迅速而且敏捷，快得連人的眼睛也撩亂了，</p>
<p>那邊，突出兩個懷抱般的小山峯背後是一個天然的險要的小島嶼。－這便是楊家港。多少漁人在這裏爲了生活葬送了他幸福的一生。同時，幾年前的這裏，也有多少倖運兒靠了這山巴，發上一筆大財，換上了絲綢的衣服，不過，那是以前的事了，現在這末一個荒凉的天然漁網，都給西江上游的漁民們截斷了來路，整羣的魚踪，已很少來到這衰老了的楊家港了。這時，便只光剩下了散夥的打撈點過日子的小帆船了。</p>
<p>在那磷硝的岸邊，給浪花衝擊着的地方，常有三數赤裸着半身的漁婦，張開一面大網，朝淺水的地方起。費個點</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>把鐘的時光，朝着那張破舊了的漁網，便張開了那貧饞的眼睛，掛上一個希望</p>
<p>「呸！那媽個臭×！黃瘟監蔓！」</p>
<p>網上只張羅着那在掙扎地跳躍着的江蝦，還夾着幾條銀白色的小魚、於是，她們失望了，從心坎裏憂怨地咒駡一聲。</p>
<p>拍－沙沙沙</p>
<p>一個不知從什麽地方湧起的暗浪很猛烈地拍到崖岸來了。一下站不住她給撞倒了，身子一側，繩子一牽絆，走在旁邊的趁勢一張，才算抉穩了脚步站了起來。口裏已嚕哩嚕地罵了出來了：</p>
<p>「從那個洋面來的罡風咧，撞得你老娘好苦大秋天，正趕潮汛……」</p>
<p>「嫂子，我看不是好風色呢？你看，天那邊已給那堆烏雲蓋上了，怕不一下子便把風呀雨的趕到這邊來！</p>
<p>年輕的小姑像煞滿有經騐般的在勸導着那站不穩脚的嫂子。那做嫂嫂的心頭才淸醒過來了。口里驚惶失措地空張了幾下，而後才算歇轉了一口氣似的驚呼着：</p>
<p>「走啊！走啊！頂頭風不是開玩笑的，怕趕不回到村里去咧！那媽個×：……」</p>
<p>那邊，同來的幾條小帆船，這時都聳着人頭。大家都急忙着收網，網收好了，人也上了船了，又得收帆　帆遇了風，是十張九倒的。於是，她們手忙脚亂地，紛擾地吆喝着，呼喚着，剛那寗靜的情景已不知給駭到什麽地方去了。烏雲已展開了它的翼蓋了過來，一陣子黑把人更駭得慌亂。天空中的牙鷹這時已不知飛到什麽地方去了。在這兒只餘下了恐怖，張惶，像大難臨頭般的畏懼。</p>
<p>拚盡了她們的力量，這幾條小帆船，魚串般挨近着對岸那邊掙扎去了。</p>
<p>「唷哎喲，呀喂　　啊，唷，哎喲　」</p>
<p>也像是絕望的呼聲，也像是弱者的呻吟，在這兒，是給這低沉的，抑鬱的求生的，向上的調子沉溺着了。</p>
<p>嗚嗚！嗚！</p>
<p>風漸漸從四面八方襲攏了來，示威般的吼呌着。那盤旋在空中像匹惡鳥般的烏雲，這時已完全遮蓋了這海面了。一切已打入了陰沉的空氣里面了。給風掀起的秋天的浪濤，是比一切都來得大的。從小山崗般湧成了比船還要高的巨濤，像個魔術師的手掌般，殘忍而又淫酷地戲弄着這幾倏爲了生存而掙扎的小帆船。小船頭碰擊着了那貪食無饜的正張着宜口的浪山，很不自然地給拋上了半空，又很不自然地給擲了下來，便是這末一上一下地，翻動着。</p>
<p>船上的人是凝重得像尊佛。她們憑了經騐要在死的命運之　搏鬥；把舵的是穩定而且堅决，在船前頭划着槳的，這時已像完全失去了知覺般的只知道繃起了額角的紅筋般在划，年靑的小孩子這時也忘了嘻笑，一付成人氣味地戽着一斗又一斗的艙水。</p>
<p>雨也從四面八方襲擊了來了。打到人的面上，手上，皮膚上，都是辛辣辣地刺痛。可是，掙扎，人羣却在歌唱着這勇猛的鬥爭。</p>

<h3>Tianjin News: Certain Parties Oppose Expanding the Suiyuan Incident, Changes in Strategy for Further Offensives, Qingdao Case Also to be Resolved Locally, Japanese Privy Council Seriously Questions Arita's Diplomacy, Various Parties Believe the Suiyuan and Qingdao Cases Form a Sino-Japanese Standoff</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) A source in Tianjin revealed that after recent deliberations, the central government has telegraphed instructions to its land and sea forces in North China and the Guandong region. Regarding the Suiyuan and Qingdao issues, they are ordered to avoid expansion and resolve them locally without losing face. The plan for Suiyuan is to first strengthen the internal structure of the Mongol puppet army, change the strategy of advancement, and then, after the situation cools down, launch a surprise attack. It is also reported that the Tianjin military headquarters has ordered a staff officer to be dispatched to Qingdao to convey this intention to the resident military attaché, Koki Ogidi, and to obtain the consent of the Third Fleet of the Navy. Therefore, the Qingdao case may be resolved quickly in the next few days. A major war in Suiyuan is also unlikely to occur in the near future. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the regular meeting of the Privy Council on the 9th, a free debate continued for two hours. During this time, serious questions were raised about Arita's diplomacy, and the following wishes were expressed, which amounted to a warning to Arita: Be vigilant against errors in diplomatic policy that may be caused by national policy, as they could lead to irreparable disasters for the nation. The government must be fully prepared and firmly believe, not be misled by petty-minded doctrines, or be overcome by powerful parties, thereby harming the foundation of the nation. The questions raised were approximately as follows: What are the government's strategies for Sino-Japanese negotiations? Although Sino-Japanese relations are considered the most important issue from the perspective of Japanese national policy, they have practically broken down. The Suiyuan incident is hindering negotiations. Does the government lack control in implementing diplomatic policy? Is there any hope for the continued holding of Sino-Japanese negotiations? Was the declaration by the Prime Minister of Manchukuo, Zhang Jinghui, issued with Japan's tacit approval? Although the declaration of the Kwantung Army appears to be without problems on the surface, it gives an impression of disunity when compared to the declaration of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Regarding the above questions, Arita replied that Sino-Japanese negotiations initially proceeded smoothly, but suddenly deteriorated due to the Suiyuan incident and the Japan-Germany agreement, leading to a stalemate. However, the situation has not reached a point of breakdown. Currently, Suiyuan is gradually becoming quieter, and it is hoped that after some time, China's misunderstanding will be dispelled, and the adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations may still be possible. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet received a report from the Commander of the Kwantung Army, Ueda, regarding Zhang Jinghui's declaration. The Kwantung Army's declaration aims at the joint defense of Japan and Manchukuo, while the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' declaration focuses on Japanese diplomatic policy. It is reported that the Privy Council was not satisfied with Arita's responses, and there is a high possibility that the current issues will cause intense internal strife. (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) In recent days, not only newspapers have criticized the diplomatic policies and secret diplomacy of Prime Minister Hirota and Foreign Minister Arita with vehement attacks, but also the Privy Council and political parties have condemned them with harsh words. One of the targets of attack is the fisheries agreement, which has not yet been signed by the Soviet Union. This agreement has been approved by the Privy Council, and Foreign Minister Arita guaranteed that the Soviet Union would definitely sign it. However, due to the establishment of the Japan-Germany agreement, the Soviet Union has indefinitely postponed the signing. Especially in view of the fact that there is no precedent in Japanese diplomatic history for a treaty that has been approved by the Privy Council not being signed, the government's responsibility is severely criticized. Another target of attack is the progress of Sino-Japanese negotiations. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already announced it, while the Japanese government has kept it secret from the people. Therefore, various parties are criticizing the policies and strategies adopted by the Japanese diplomatic authorities. The fact that the Suiyuan and Qingdao incidents are the direct causes of the current stalemate has made various parties deeply aware of the deficiency of "non-unified diplomacy." Therefore, the sound of condemnation of the government's failure to control is heard everywhere. On the 8th, Seiyukai member Ando raised the most serious questions to Prime Minister Hirota and Foreign Minister Arita, namely, whether Sino-Japanese negotiations have broken down and what Japan's true attitude towards the situation in Suiyuan is. Hirota and Arita replied that negotiations have temporarily stopped, but have not broken down, and they are currently waiting for an opportune time to resume. The situation in Suiyuan is related to "Manchukuo," but not to Japan, and there is no tendency for it to worsen. Ando further questioned that since Japan has announced to the world that Japan has nothing to do with the Suiyuan incident, Japan must be responsible for making the world trust Japan's official statements. Regarding this point, Hirota and Arita replied that the true situation will soon become clear. Ando also questioned in a sharp tone that there is a huge rift between the opinions of the central government and officials stationed abroad regarding diplomatic issues, and there are even contradictions. Does the government intend to find a way to deal with the current situation? Hirota and Arita directly admitted that they also felt the same way and guaranteed that they would continue to work to achieve unification. At the same time, the Minseito Party, due to the declaration by the Prime Minister of Manchukuo, Zhang Jinghui, on the 8th, supporting the Mongol army, has begun to investigate whether this declaration was made with Japan's tacit approval. The Privy Council will hold a fierce debate at its regular meeting on the 9th. (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the plenary meeting of the Privy Council on the 9th, Foreign Minister Arita explained the current issues and requested the understanding of the Privy Council. The content of the Foreign Minister's explanation after the meeting that day was roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Japan-Italy Agreement</p>
<p>The Japan-Italy agreement is merely an exchange of official documents between the two governments and does not contain any agreement in nature. Other than what has been announced, there are no other provisions. However, ensuring economic interests in Abyssinia will be subject to detailed agreements in the future.</p>
<p>Japan-Soviet Fisheries</p>
<p>The Japan-Soviet Fisheries Treaty, based on the Treaty of Portsmouth, obligates the Soviet Union to conclude it legally. At the same time, the purpose is to prevent disputes related to Japanese North Pacific fisheries and to exercise Japan's fishing rights. Therefore, it is believed that the Soviet Union cannot refuse to sign the treaty. The Soviet Union is currently using domestic procedures as an excuse, but domestic procedures are not permanent. Therefore, Japan will always take complete measures before the expiration of the treaty to ensure that the signing is completed.</p>
<p>Sino-Japanese Negotiations</p>
<p>Sino-Japanese negotiations are not ending immediately. The government will continue to instruct Consul General Suma to continue practical negotiations. The ultimate goal of the negotiations is the satisfactory adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations. (9th Allied Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Marines Not Withdrawn from Qingdao, Disagreement Once Emerged but Later Eased, Oikawa Leaves Qingdao to Return to Japan, Most Workers Return to Their Hometowns</h3>
<p>(Qingdao) After several meetings between Shen Honglie and Nishiharu Hiko, opinions on both sides were close, but after the 8th, the claims of both sides differed again, almost forming a stalemate. Negotiations continued on the evening of the 9th, with much consultation and frank discussion, and the situation eased again, with the possibility of a quick resolution. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) Oikawa left Qingdao on the Harada Maru on the morning of the 9th to return to Japan. Japanese Consul Nishiharu Hiko and personnel from various naval and land relations departments, as well as Zhou Jiayan, the representative of our Third Fleet Commander Xie Gangzhe and Shen Honglie, all went to the port to see him off. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) The Qingdao incident is currently being negotiated by Shen Honglie and Nishiharu Hiko. Most of the workers in the factories in Sifang and Cangqiao have left Qingdao. The laid-off workers are provided with severance pay and sent back to their hometowns by the factory in conjunction with the official authorities. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Han Tan, the Qingdao Guo Bureau Chief, came to Jinan to discuss the Qingdao incident. There is hope for a peaceful resolution. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After Japanese soldiers illegally landed in Qingdao, Mayor Shen Honglie and Japanese Consul Nishiharu Hiko negotiated repeatedly, and the situation has gradually eased. The Japanese marines may withdraw immediately. The time of withdrawal has not yet been received from Shen by telegram. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) The situation here on the 9th is still very relaxed, but the Japanese marines in the Sifang and Cangqiao areas are not preparing to withdraw. The state of alert on both sides is as usual. Japanese soldiers come and go on the roads from time to time, mostly unarmed sailors from the Takatsuki and other ships. The negotiations have progressed six times. In the morning of the 9th, Zhou Jiayan, a staff member of the municipal government, had contact with members of the Japanese consulate. Shen Honglie and Nishiharu Hiko will continue negotiations in the evening. According to reliable information, both sides are eager to resolve the issue as soon as possible, and there is no problem in principle. The current dispute is only over the order of factory resumption and Japanese troop withdrawal. Our side believes that under the threat of Japanese troops, it is extremely difficult to make workers feel safe enough to resume work. Furthermore, if the Japanese troops do not withdraw, our side will have no way to mediate the labor unrest. Although the Japanese side has put forward several demands, its focus is also only on resuming work as soon as possible. If the nine cotton mills remain closed for a long time, the losses suffered by the Japanese side will be enormous. It goes without saying that they are eager to resolve the issue quickly. After Hasegawa Kiyoshi arrived in Qingdao, he held several meetings with the captains of various ships and resident military attachés, but has not yet visited Shen. In the past week, Japanese merchants here have been willing to restore the situation as soon as possible due to the sluggish business. (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Qingdao telephone, around 2 pm on the 9th, Hasegawa, accompanied by various ship captains, took cars to inspect the cotton mills in Sifang and Cangqiao. They returned to the city at 4 pm. Shen Honglie and the Qingdao Japanese Consul met at twelve o'clock on the night of the 8th, but there was still no result. The story of some factories resuming work is not accurate. The city government summoned more than 500 workers dismissed by the factories and more than 100 workers detained by the Public Security Bureau to be sent back to their hometowns with severance pay. (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After Japanese sailors arbitrarily landed in Qingdao, searched the party headquarters, and arrested staff, the people of the whole country were extremely indignant. It is now learned that the party headquarters of the provinces of Henan, Yunnan, and Hubei have all telegraphed to the central government, believing that the Japanese soldiers' unreasonable actions disregard our sovereignty to the extreme. They requested the government to swiftly protest seriously, demand appropriate compensation, and maintain national integrity and appease public anger. (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Since the general strike of Japanese cotton mills in Qingdao, the number of unemployed workers has reached 29,000, and the number of dependents who have become destitute is no less than 100,000. It is now the dead of winter, and if work cannot be resumed, they will be starved and cold. Moreover, most of the workers are women and children, so emergency relief must be arranged. It is now learned that the government is very concerned about this matter. In order to implement relief, the Executive Yuan and relevant provinces and cities have properly planned effective measures to resettle the unemployed workers as soon as possible to avoid displacement. (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) There are currently eight Japanese warships anchored here, with a total force of 3,000 soldiers. The Chinese side now feels that the strength of the Chinese army stationed near Qingdao is sufficient to cope with any possible incidents, but it is expected that negotiations can be resolved peacefully and that force will not be used. Although rumors are rampant here, the tense situation has gradually eased. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Suma Visits Gao Zongwu, Continues to Exchange Views, Emphasizing the Chengdu Incident, Will Meet Again in Two or Three Days</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Suma, secretary of the Japanese embassy, visited Gao Zongwu, Director of the Asian Department, on the afternoon of the 9th to continue exchanging views on adjusting Sino-Japanese relations. It is reported that the two emphasized discussion of the Chengdu incident. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that since Chengdu has abolished its municipal status, it should be regarded as the capital of an inland province. However, some countries have set up consular officers there. France has already withdrawn, and it is now planned to propose negotiations to withdraw them all uniformly. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After Kawagoe went to Shanghai, the negotiations on adjusting Sino-Japanese relations were still in a lull. Our ambassador to Japan, Xu Shiying, recently visited the Japanese Foreign Ministry for talks. According to diplomatic sources, Ambassador Xu met with Japanese diplomatic authorities in Tokyo, but there was no new contact. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Suma, the secretary of the Japanese embassy and consul-general stationed in Beijing, visited Gao Zongwu, Director of the Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at 3 pm on the 9th and left after an hour of talks. It is reported that they discussed the Chengdu incident and other general issues. (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Suma and Gao Zongwu conducted the second round of official consultations at Gao's private residence at 3 pm today. They continued the previous negotiations on the Chengdu incident and other unfortunate incidents that frequently occurred in other places, but no agreement was reached. After Suma asked Ambassador Kawagoe for instructions and Gao asked Foreign Minister Zhang for instructions, it was decided to discuss it again in two or three days. The meeting ended at 4:30 pm. (9th Allied Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Qin Dechun, etc., Host Farewell Banquet for Matsumuro</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Qin Dechun, Qi Xieyuan, and others hosted a farewell banquet for Matsumuro at the Diplomatic Building at noon on the 9th, inviting Kawabe and Imai to accompany them. (9th Dispatch) Qin Dechun and Jia Deyao hosted a luncheon for Matsumuro Takayoshi on the 9th, inviting Kawabe and Imai to accompany them. Matsumuro's successor, Matsui Sadaichi, will come to Beiping on the 14th to take over his duties. Matsumuro is scheduled to leave Beiping on the 18th to take up his new post. (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese Future, Connected to Japan</h3>
<p>—Asahi Shimbun Commentary—</p>
<p>Enemy or Friend, Depending on Japan's Policies</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Asahi Shimbun's editorial today stated, "The breakdown of Sino-Japanese negotiations has become an undeniable fact. No one wants to see Sino-Japanese relations become more tense, but the Sino-Japanese situation has an extremely serious tendency after the current breakdown. Today's China is clearly not a friend of Japan. Whether China is made a friend or forced to become an enemy depends solely on Japan's determination." According to reporters, Japanese public opinion is now seriously watching the future of Sino-Japanese relations, and at the same time, they are not giving up hope of breaking the current stalemate. However, the key to determining the Sino-Japanese situation is clearly in the hands of the Japanese authorities, depending on how they change their policy towards China.

<h3>Northern Suiyuan, Bandit Puppet Troops Surrounded by National Army, It is Said that Wang Jingguo and Others Discussed Bandit Suppression Matters, De Wang Enlists Strong Men, Mongols Resent it Greatly, No Contact in Eastern Suiyuan, National Army is Strictly Guarding</h3>
<p>(Guihua) This time, when the bandit army counterattacked Bailingmiao, our troops guarding the temple initially responded calmly and then bravely counterattacked. Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan were extremely pleased and specially awarded 10,000 yuan in foreign currency. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) Wang Jingguo, Zhao Chengshou, and Fu Zuoyi have been arranging military affairs in northern Suiyuan for days. Since the 7th, our army has been mobilized, and the bandits have been surrounded. Except for those who have surrendered, the remaining bandits can be cleared. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) On the afternoon of the 9th, Fu Zuoyi visited Wang Jingguo and Zhao Chengshou to discuss bandit suppression matters. Wang will stay here for several more days before going to Taiyuan to meet Yan Xishan. It is reported that although the situation in eastern Suiyuan has been ostensibly relaxed but secretly tense recently, there has been no contact. However, the National Army's defenses have not been relaxed at all, because the bandits' intentions may be triggered at any moment. Fortunately, the work in Suiyuan is currently limited to preventing and suppressing bandits. All foreign affairs matters are handled by the central government, and the situation is not complicated, so it can be handled with ease. (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) After Shi Yushan of Wang Ying's army surrendered, on the morning of the 9th, Fu Zuoyi specially allocated a large sum of money and telegraphed to the front line to Deputy Army Commander Zeng Yan to gather and speak to all officers of Shi's army nearby, and to distribute money to reward and encourage them. As for Wang Ying's surrender, it is still under negotiation. (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Jining telegram, our army in eastern Suiyuan is gathered like clouds and can outflank the rear of the puppet army in Shangdu at any time, and capture Shangdu in one fell swoop. Recently, more and more puppet troops have surrendered, and our morale is increasing. The soldiers all have the ambition to smash the bandits' lair. The bandits and puppets are increasingly panicked. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Jining telegram, when Wang Ying's puppet bandits attacked and disturbed northern Suiyuan, certain parties issued many poison gas shells. The puppet army had difficulty marching on the snow, making transportation inconvenient, and most of the artillerymen were not good at using them, so they abandoned them along the way. When our Sun Division searched the puppet army, they found many of them, which were all transported to [omitted]. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The place in northern Suiyuan is gradually becoming peaceful, and a certain party's special service agency in Alashan Banner has also been abolished. The [certain] country's reporter Kijizaki and the workers of the special service agency, including Kossi, have left Suiyuan and come to Beiping some days ago and transferred to other places. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhangbei, De Wang recruits strong men from all banners of Xilingol League into the army and launches a large-scale invasion of Suiyuan. According to Mongols from Mount Chaowutai, De Wang was coerced by certain parties to attempt to invade Ulanqab League (i.e., the land above the Daqingshan in Suiyuan) in the hope of unifying the two leagues of Xilingol and Ulanqab to form a puppet Mongolian government. However, the Mongols are accustomed to nomadic life and freedom. Being enlisted into the army is against their will, and they are driven to the front line without proper training, resulting in death. When the Mongols hear the news, many families cry bitterly and are extremely resentful of De Wang. The residents in Shangdu city have mostly fled, leaving only 3,000 puppet troops, in an extremely desolate state. On the 9th, 3,000 Rehe troops arrived at Huluyu in Baochang. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) People from Pingdiquan said that the National Army in northern Suiyuan is advancing forward and will be able to recover Damao Temple, near the place, within days. The place is defended by Mongol-Manchu troops. At the same time, the attacking army is threatening eastern Suiyuan. It is heard that 10,000 people are gathered near Xinghe, and they will launch another offensive after receiving the bullets continuously transported out of Zhangbei. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) The bandit suppression military affairs in northern Suiyuan have now achieved an extremely gratifying result, namely, Shi Yushan, the brigade commander of Wang Ying's bandit gang who was entrenched in Damao Temple, led all his men, a total of three and a half infantry regiments and one artillery company, to suddenly surrender to the National Army. Shi himself went to a certain place at 4 pm on the 8th to meet Deputy Army Commander Zeng Yan to discuss ways to reorganize the army and expressed his sincere patriotism, vowing not to be an accomplice of the bandits and puppets. Deputy Army Commander Zeng praised him deeply on the spot and telegraphed to Fu Zuoyi, Zhao Chengshou, Wang Jingguo, and other generals, all of whom expressed their joy and deeply praised Shi's remorseful patriotism. In addition to the surrender of Shi's brigade, only one guard company remains following Wang's side. Wang himself now lives in a certain place, becoming a trapped beast. Moreover, many small groups of bandits in other places have also surrendered in recent days. From this, it can be seen that the patriotic heart of the Mongol bandits and puppets has not been completely extinguished. (8th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Tashiro Arrives in Beiping from Tianjin, Inspects Garrison Troops in Fengtai, Will Visit Song for Discussions</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The commander of the Japanese army in Tianjin, Tashiro, accompanied by Chief of Staff Hashimoto Gun and more than 20 adjutants, arrived in Beiping on the morning of the 9th. They stopped temporarily at Fengtai, and Tashiro and others got off the car to inspect the Japanese barracks and give speeches. At 4 pm, they took a special train from Fengtai to Beiping. Qin Dechun, Chen Jiqing, Chen Zhongfu, Kawabe, and others all went to the station to welcome them. After Tashiro got off the train, he inspected the Japanese army outside the station and then went to the Fusang Hall to rest. He is scheduled to visit Song on the 10th for discussions. He will stay in Beiping for one or two days before returning to Tianjin. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At 8 am on the 9th, Tashiro, accompanied by Hashimoto, Special Army Commander Tamura, Mutaguchi, Regiment Commander Matsuyama, and others, went to Fengtai to inspect the two battalions of the Kawabe Brigade, Kitata and Ichiki, and inspected the two detachments of Morita and Suzuki in Tongzhou. (9th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Judicial Yuan Interpretation of Opium Suppression Doubts</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Judicial Yuan interpreted the doubts regarding the jurisdiction of the provincial branch directors of the Opium Suppression Supervision Office in handling disciplinary matters. Opium suppression is a general administrative matter. Although the Opium Suppression Director-General is concurrently held by the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, the civil servants under his jurisdiction who handle opium suppression affairs are still general administrative officials. Their disciplinary matters should be under the jurisdiction of the Civil Servant Disciplinary Committee. (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Judicial Yuan explained the doubts regarding the cases of civil servants smoking and being handed over for disciplinary action. (1) A civil servant being impeached for smoking and being investigated for smoking are two different matters. Since the case has been transferred for disciplinary action, it should be accepted in accordance with the law. (2) Smoking is a crime under the Provisional Regulations for Punishing Opium Suppression. According to Article 24 of the regulations, it should be sent directly to the competent judicial organ for trial. (3) The assessment of those responsible for reporting informants who know the situation but fail to report it and those who handle opium suppression affairs is slightly different. Regarding disciplinary action, the provisions of the Civil Servant Disciplinary Law should still apply. (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Chinese Peking Man Material Complete</h3>
<p>Above All Other Places in the World</p>
<p>(Nanjing) In the limestone mountains of Zhoukoudian, Hebei Province, personnel from the Geological Survey Institute previously discovered Peking Man teeth, skulls, and fossils of various animals such as wolves and deer.

This material is currently being studied by Weidenreich, who is jointly hired by the Institute and the Beiping Union Medical College. It is said that the larger one belongs to a male and the smaller one belongs to a female. Their components are complete and far exceed those obtained previously. Based on the existing materials, it can be known that the brain capacity of Chinese Peking Man is from 950 to 1100 cubic centimeters for males and from 850 to 950 cubic centimeters for females. The difference in brain capacity between males and females is much greater than that of modern humans, but it is quite similar to that of apes.

Among such ancient ape-man fossils, the completeness of the Chinese Peking Man material has surpassed that obtained in all other places in the world. (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Reasons for Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies Marrying Local Women</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to relevant sources, the number of our overseas Chinese compatriots who go to the Dutch East Indies to make a living reaches more than 500,000.

According to a survey, there are more than 10,700 local women cohabitating with our overseas Chinese compatriots throughout the Dutch East Indies, but the actual number is probably even higher. The main reasons are threefold: (1) Chinese are more likely to approach local women than other people of color. (2) It is cheaper for Chinese to marry local women than to marry women of the same nationality. (3) Chinese have better economic abilities than local men, so local women are willing to marry Chinese.

<h3>Consistency in Grain Policy</h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai grain market has once again stirred up a major uproar. First, Jiading County detained more than two hundred grain boats passing through, almost rendering the Zhabei rice market non-existent. However, because of the provisional regulatory measures passed by the Executive Yuan this month, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, at its meeting on the 8th, decided to abolish the provincial regulations strictly prohibiting the export of food grains on a temporary basis and instructed Jiading County to release the grain boats. This issue has been generally resolved. The release of grain boats detained in Yueqing, Zhejiang Province, is also expected to be unproblematic.</p>
<p>Second, the price of flour and wheat has been rising endlessly, with prices even reaching a limit of one dime several times. According to yesterday's closing market prices, forward (April) flour has already gone up to four dollars and one dime, and wheat is also above seven dollars. Such a frenzied surge is, aside from other issues, bound to lead to a price increase for noodles, which cost 240 cash per catty. This has a significant impact on the livelihoods of ordinary people.</p>
<p>Third, the persistent rise in the price of coarse grains and oil beans is also a matter of great concern. Since the loss of the four northeastern provinces, China has not only lost its way in foreign trade, but the supply of coarse grains has also been greatly affected. In particular, the oil bean market has been manipulated, with prices lowered for dumping and held high for control. Moreover, in recent years, various countries have engaged in the construction of food security, storing as much as possible food grains such as rice, wheat, and oil beans. The continuous increase in prices is largely due to this.</p>
<p>The above three points cannot help but evoke some mixed feelings. We believe that although it is not necessary to hastily prohibit exports, the huge amount of japonica rice and thin rice being shipped to Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places this year is probably unprecedented. If it is for the consumption of the people in the north, that goes without saying. But if there is another purpose, it is difficult to guarantee that the rice and grains will not be smuggled in the most active smuggling areas, which is worthy of attention. As for the rise in flour and wheat prices, even if it is because the local wheat is insufficient and foreign wheat is needed to make up for it, and foreign wheat is not suitable for ordering due to import duties, a solution should be sought immediately, and inaction should not be tolerated. Otherwise, if the speculative effect is greater than the relationship of raw materials, the exchange should be supervised by the government and cracked down on to prevent it from harming the people's food. Furthermore, in terms of general food grains, there have been reports of drought and famine from the autumn of this year. We cannot be blindly optimistic because of this year's bumper harvest. We must know that in the current situation without statistical surveys, a major food shortage next year is very likely. We should be aware that in today's situation, the construction of food security is urgent. The outflow and inflow of food grains should be subject to appropriate management, and the adjustment of food grains, whether in peacetime or wartime, should be planned in a coordinated manner. In short, food policy is a whole and consistent one, and there must be a central executive agency to grasp its key points and determine appropriate plans based on major interests. If only piecemeal efforts are made, not only will disputes easily arise, but it will also be harmful to the people's food problems in the future.</p>
<h3>British Constitution Faces Crisis: Cabinet Offers Final Advice, Parliamentarians Support Prime Minister, Rumors Swirl of King's Determination to Abdicate, Succession Becomes Problem</h3>
<p>(London) Regarding the constitutional dispute caused by the marriage issue, it is widely rumored in Parliament that the King's confidants have sought the opinions of a majority of members. Political observers have recently declared that, regarding this dispute, members, whether belonging to the trade union or the Labor Party, cannot support the King, as their views seem to have converged, namely, that the Constitution stipulates that the King must abide by it. (Havas dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) Well-informed sources recently declared that the King invited his brothers, the Duke of York and the Duke of Kent, Prime Minister Baldwin, and other important figures to dinner at Fort Belvedere last night and, after lengthy discussions, has decided to abdicate. However, whether the successor to the throne will be his brother, the Duke of York, or Princess Elizabeth, daughter of the Duke of York, with Queen Mary and others forming a regency council to act on her behalf until she comes of age, has not yet been decided. (Havas dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) An Associated Press reporter learned today from reliable sources that King Edward has decided to abdicate rather than abandon the American woman Mrs. Simpson. This determination is said to be irreversible and may be announced to the House of Commons today. Prime Minister Baldwin met with the King at Fort Belvedere for five hours last night and, with the King's decision, hurriedly returned to his Downing Street residence early this morning to consult with Home Secretary Sir John Simon and scheduled an emergency cabinet meeting for 11:00 this morning to report to all cabinet members. The Duke of York, the Duke of Kent, and Monkton, legal advisor to the Duchy of Cornwall, were present at last night's meeting in the palace. People in Buckingham Palace now firmly believe that the situation is about to take a sharp turn. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) A political reporter for the Mail declared today that political figures generally believe that King Edward may ultimately feel compelled to abdicate. Various preparations are already being made. Financial figures have also learned that the King has conveyed his intention to abdicate to Prime Minister Baldwin. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<h3>Cabinet Meeting: Tight Security, Details Unknown</h3>
<p>(London) The Cabinet met at 11:00 this morning to discuss the constitutional dispute caused by the King's marriage issue. Security was very tight, and the details are unknown. It is only known that Prime Minister Baldwin does not intend to make a statement to the House of Commons today. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) At the regular cabinet meeting held at 11:00 this morning, the constitutional dispute involving the King's marriage was the main issue. All cabinet members attended and deliberated in secret for two and a half hours. An hour before the meeting, Home Secretary Simon went to the Prime Minister's residence on Downing Street. Shortly after, Mr. Monkton, the private secretary of the Duke of York, also arrived. Sir Peacock, the Receiver-General of the Duchy of Cornwall, also arrived at the Prime Minister's residence this morning. The King's brothers, the Duke of York and the Duke of Kent, left the King's residence, Fort Belvedere, together at 11:00 last night, but the Duke of Kent returned to the palace at 1:00 this morning and spent the night there. Mr. Monkton also stayed overnight at the palace. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>Fort Belvedere: Meetings Until Late at Night, Prime Minister and Other Important Figures Dine at Palace, Wedding Issue Under Last Consideration</h3>
<p>(London) Last night, Prime Minister Baldwin had dinner at Fort Belvedere with the King, the Duke of York, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Monckton, Legal Advisor to the Duchy of Cornwall, and Mr. Meville, Private Secretary to the Duke of York, and held important discussions on the constitutional crisis. The Prime Minister arrived at the palace at 5:30 PM with Mr. Monckton and Mr. Melville. The Duke of Kent had been with the King all day and was already at the palace. The Duke of York's car entered through the back door of the palace at 6:30 PM, but the occupant of the car could not be identified. The Prime Minister stayed at the palace for four hours and forty-five minutes, leaving at 10:15 PM and returning to his residence on Downing Street. Home Secretary Simon had arrived at the residence at 9:30 PM to await him. The Prime Minister did not arrive until 11:00 PM and talked with Simon for forty-five minutes before he left. When the House of Commons meets today, there will be no detailed announcement of the situation, but it may be briefly mentioned. When the Cabinet holds a regular meeting at 11:00 this morning, it will still discuss the King's marriage. Yesterday, activity was not only taking place at Fort Belvedere, but also at Whitehall (where various government departments are located), Westminster Abbey, and Buckingham Palace, all of which were unusually busy. The King's private secretary, Major Hardinge, traveled by car from Lambeth Palace to Buckingham Palace last night to see Archbishop of Canterbury Cosmo Gordon Lang. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) Based on the current situation, the outcome of the palace meeting does not seem to have resulted in any decision, and the parties involved are still maintaining their original positions. As for how the dispute will ultimately end, opinions vary. The Cabinet still believes that the King's abdication is inevitable, while those around the King say that the points of contention are not insurmountable. Another group of people believe that no decision can be made until Mrs. Simpson's legal advisor, Mr. Goddard, and the famous London doctor, Dr. Kirkwood, return to London, as the three have flown to Cannes, France, yesterday. However, political figures generally believe that the dispute must be resolved quickly, as the current situation is protracted and could endanger the political situation. (Havas dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Meets, Labor MPs Ask Questions, Prime Minister Will Continue to Make Statements Today and Tomorrow, Political Circles Expect Abdication Is Almost Inevitable</h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Baldwin made no statement in the House of Commons today regarding the constitutional dispute, but said he hoped to have something to announce tomorrow. When the House of Commons reconvened this afternoon, Labor opposition leader Clement Attlee asked Baldwin if he could add anything to Monday's official statement. Baldwin replied, "I have nothing to announce today, but I hope to have a statement tomorrow." Labor MP Mr. Paling then spoke, asking the government to pay attention to the fact that the lack of a decision on the constitutional dispute has caused great inconvenience in the financial sector, and asked the Prime Minister to advise the King to make a decision quickly. Baldwin replied that he had paid attention to this situation. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) Political figures and members of Parliament all believe that the King's abdication is almost inevitable, and may become a reality within hours after last night's meeting at Fort Belvedere. After the King abdicates, he may be renamed the Earl of Chester. People in the Parliament's tearoom said that several legal advisors to the Crown were very busy making contacts today, and what they were discussing was the issue of the King's financial resources after his abdication. It is noted that the British Parliament passed the Act of Settlement in 1701, which stipulates that the British throne cannot be vacated except upon the death of the monarch or by law passed by Parliament. Therefore, in legal principle, it cannot be vacant. Generally speaking, after Edward VIII decides to abdicate, he should send an edict to Parliament publicly announcing his intention to abdicate, and then Parliament will pass a law to accept it and announce who will be established as the new monarch. In short, until the parliaments of the United Kingdom and its dominions formally announce the accession of the new monarch, Edward VIII will still reign over the country for one more day. (Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Canberra. The Australian House of Representatives met for eighteen minutes today before adjourning. Prime Minister Lyons said, "I sincerely hope that this crisis can be avoided, so it is best for Parliament to remain silent." Labor MPs opposed the adjournment due to a lack of opportunity to express their views. Leader Curtin believed that the King should have the freedom to choose his marriage, "but the King must also bear the full responsibility for his personal conscience and the entire empire. Once the choice is made, the Labor Party hopes that the King will not abdicate." (National Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>(London) It was learned today from responsible sources here that the Parliament of the Irish Free State may prevent the abdication of the British King by "joking." The parliament may refuse to pass the necessary legislation under the Statute of Westminster to prevent the Duke of York from ascending the throne. It is declared here that confidants of Free State President Éamon de Valera have issued this warning to the authorities in London. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>
<h3>Inside Story of Mysterious Plane Revealed: Mrs. Simpson's Legal Advisor and Famous Doctor Travel Together, How Can the King's Lovers Force a Smile When Their Hearts Are Full of Worries?</h3>
<p>Cannes, France. London suburb of Croydon Aerodrome. A mysterious plane flew out yesterday morning and arrived in Marseille in the afternoon. The plane carried three people: besides Mrs. Simpson's legal advisor, Mr. Goddard, the other two were a famous London doctor, Dr. Kirkwood, and Mr. Barron, a clerk of Mr. Goddard's law firm. After landing in Marseille, the three transferred to a car and arrived here that evening, staying at a hotel. According to Lord Brownlow, the King's private secretary, Dr. Kirkwood is a friend of Mr. Goddard, who is slightly ill and fears that his condition will worsen due to the hardship of the journey, so he came with the doctor. Dr. Kirkwood is now scheduled to move to Monte Carlo today. When Lord Brownlow spoke, he looked overwhelmed with grief. (Havas dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>Cannes, France. London suburb of Croydon Aerodrome. A mysterious plane carrying three passengers flew out this morning and arrived in Marseille at 4:15 PM. The names of the three passengers were kept secret when they departed and have now been revealed (see previous dispatch). After landing in Marseille, the three had a quick meal and then continued on their way to this place. According to two statements made to the press by Lord Brownlow, the King's private secretary, Mrs. Simpson does not intend to return to England anytime soon, and her residence in London should be closed urgently. Mr. Goddard came here to discuss this issue with Mrs. Simpson. As for Mrs. Simpson's plans, she intends to stay here until Christmas, after which her destination is unknown. Also, since Mrs. Simpson arrived here, the Villa Lou Viei has been heavily guarded, and journalists and photographers have been lingering outside the gates all day and are not allowed to enter. Today, one British and one American photographer from each country were allowed to enter to meet with Mrs. Simpson. Mrs. Simpson looked worried. One of them asked Mrs. Simpson to smile so that he could take a photo. Mrs. Simpson angrily replied, "Why should I smile? Do you think this is a time for me to smile?" Soon after, several local photographers were also allowed to enter to take several photos of Mrs. Simpson. At this point, Lord Brownlow said that Mrs. Simpson had satisfied the journalists and now wished to stay quiet and rest, and asked them not to bother her anymore. As for Mrs. Simpson's health, she is currently in good health and has not consulted a doctor. (Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Rumors spread that Mrs. Simpson will come here and stay at the villa of British Lord Beresford. The caretakers of the villa are unaware of this, but the police here will take various measures to protect her. (Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>
<h3>British Press Commentary: Mrs. Simpson's Statement Is Enough to Save the Crisis</h3>
<p>(London) An editorial in The Times said that the King had proposed a course of action, but others had advised him against it based on the Constitution. We dare to assert that the King will accept this advice. According to the provisions of the British Constitution, when the King, the Cabinet, and Parliament reach an impasse, and there are doubts about public opinion backing the Cabinet and Parliament, they may appeal to the people of the country. However, this provision does not apply to today's events, and the King has no such doubts. Therefore, the plan for a morganatic marriage has been abandoned. What the King is now considering is whether to take any other form of action. The duty of the Cabinet is to give the King all the information they know when he consults them, so that the King has a complete understanding of the consequences of the course of action he chooses. It is not permissible for the Cabinet to directly or indirectly advise the King to make other plans, and the Cabinet has never done so. The Daily Mail said that Mrs. Simpson's statement that she was willing to avoid any action or suggestion that would harm the King or the throne has changed the whole situation. This serious and disturbing crisis now has hope of ending soon. Mrs. Simpson's actions make it possible for the King to continue in his position and save the country from the sorrow that would be caused by the King's abdication. The Daily Express said that we can rejoice now. The crisis has become history. The King is still above us. The issue of the King trampling on the Cabinet and the Cabinet forcing the King to submit in matters concerning the King himself has not arisen. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Thinker Baba Criticizes German-Japanese Agreement, Feels Emotional About Anglo-Japanese Alliance Now and Then, Foreign Minister Arita Has Made Efforts to Ease Public Opinion</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Prominent Japanese liberal thinker Baba declared that the news of the German-Japanese agreement was a bolt from the blue for the Japanese people. He solemnly stated that in 1902, the whole country was pleased with the establishment of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, but this time, the feeling towards the German-Japanese agreement is one of deep anxiety. If the sole purpose of the German-Japanese agreement is to oppose communism, then this kind of action cannot be considered wrong. However, since the conclusion of this agreement, other countries in the world have the impression that Japan has become a fascist country. In other words, Japan's ideology is neither fascist nor communist. Japan is willing to maintain a middle course and complete a constitutional government situated between the two extremes mentioned above. Judging from the current situation, Japan seems to have lost its neutral friends, such as the United Kingdom and the United States, and is seeking friendship with Italy and Germany. The Hirota Cabinet's recent secret diplomacy, such as the German-Japanese and Italian-Japanese agreements, has not only caused unrest in domestic political circles, but also aroused the attention of democratic countries overseas. People generally believe that the establishment of the two agreements was due to pressure from the military, or there is considerable reason. The Hirota Cabinet is very sensitive to the domestic and foreign reactions. Recently, the police have often suddenly sent people to visit the leaders of foreign commercial firms in Yokohama to ask for their opinions on the German-Japanese agreement, etc. In order to ease overseas public opinion, Foreign Minister Arita recently hosted foreign reporters in Tokyo and answered questions about the anti-communist agreement for more than an hour without showing any signs of fatigue. Finally, a foreign reporter asked, "If the Communist Party tries to subvert the Nanjing government, will Japan help Nanjing to prevent it from being overthrown?" The Japanese Foreign Minister replied that this question was outside the scope of the anti-communist agreement and could not be answered.

<h3>Western Rebels Actively Reinforcing: General Offensive Imminent, Bombardment of Madrid Has Not Stopped All Night, 60,000 International Volunteers Assist in Battle</h3>
<p>Madrid. At dawn today, a large contingent of fresh troops from the Spanish Nationalist Army arrived at the front line, indicating that the Nationalist Army's general offensive is indeed imminent. Last night, the city was bombarded by Nationalist artillery fire, which continued all night. This is also the prelude to the general offensive. The Nationalist artillery fire was aimed at the northwest of the capital. In the past few days, the Nationalist Army has transported 29 military supplies and 40 new aircraft. The government forces are now stepping up the excavation of trenches and the erection of barbed wire to prepare for resistance. According to estimates by the Catalan autonomous government in Barcelona, ​​there are currently 27,000 foreign volunteers assisting the government forces, many of whom have been sent to the front lines to replenish the International Brigades, which have suffered heavy losses. In the upcoming war, these volunteers will be the main force. According to reliable estimates, the government's International Brigades consist of 6,000 French people, 600 anti-fascist Italians, 1,200 anti-Nazi Germans, 800 Belgians, and 200 Polish people. The Nationalist Army has 22,000 Germans, 14,500 Italians, and 300 Irish Fascist Party members. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>Canary Islands, Port of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. The Nationalist radio station here broadcast a message stating that General Franco, the leader of the Nationalist government, had agreed to designate neutral areas within Madrid that would not be bombed, but the government forces used the neutral areas to set up air defense units to bombard Nationalist planes passing over those areas. Forced to do so, the Nationalist Army had no choice but to open fire and bombard them. In addition, several government planes flew to the city of Talavera, southwest of Madrid, yesterday, attempting to bomb it, but several were shot down by Nationalist planes, and the rest fled immediately. The front lines on the outskirts of Madrid are generally calm, but there is still artillery fire around the former Royal Palace in Moncloa, in the western district. Currently, Nationalist Army troops are moving frequently in the town of Pozuelo, in the northwestern suburbs, and it is expected that the decisive battle will not be far off. Nationalist planes are also very active, especially on the Basque front in the north. According to a statement issued by the Nationalist authorities in Salamanca, there have been no large-scale battles on the various front lines due to bad weather. The Nationalist Army shot down a government fighter plane yesterday, which was made in the Soviet Union. (Havas dispatch, 9th)</p>

<p>(London) Sir Philip Gibbs, a special correspondent for the Daily Mail, sent a dispatch today from Gibraltar, stating that the Soviet experts currently responsible for arranging Madrid's defenses have urged a military withdrawal from the city, and that this news is from a very reliable source in Valencia, so it is quite credible. It is said that the Russians advocate temporarily abandoning Madrid because most of the city's essence has been lost and has no impact on the final outcome of the war. They advise the militia to retreat to the strong positions already prepared in the southeast of the capital, and wait for the arrival of Russian reinforcements, and then launch an attack on the right wing of the Nationalist Army.

<p>New York: The rubber market was looser due to overseas telegrams, so the March opening price was 5 points, and 9.5. Then, as manufacturers and Fang Na entered, the market tended to stabilize, and the final price for March delivery was unchanged. The prices of New York goods are listed below:</p>
<h3>International Drug Trafficking Case: Warmary, Ailing, Subjected to Trial; American Court Finds Guilty, Sentencing Scheduled for This Friday</h3>
<p>Los Angeles: Ms. Warmary, a Chinese-European mixed-race woman who was arrested in the United States last month for drug trafficking, is said to be involved with a large-scale drug smuggling organization on the West Coast of the United States. The Federal Court opened a trial today and is scheduled to announce the verdict on Friday. According to U.S. law, the maximum penalty for the aforementioned charge is 20 years imprisonment and a $10,000 fine. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Los Angeles: Warmary, a Eurasian woman from Shanghai, has been found guilty by a federal jury here of smuggling drugs worth $100,000 into the United States. The woman's lawyer defended her, saying she was used by a large-scale smuggling organization but was exposed due to her incompetence in smuggling. According to reports, the case was cracked in mid-August this year. At that time, a Japanese ship came from the Far East to St. Peter. Federal agents boarded the ship to search for drugs and wanted to detain Warmary. The woman resisted desperately. Then the agents cut open the woman's suitcase with a knife, and there were as many as 54 pounds of heroin hidden in sixteen compartments. The woman then lowered her head and was speechless, and later agreed to confess the mastermind of the smuggling organization, because she claimed that she was just a poorly compensated tool. After receiving the drugs in Shanghai each time, she crossed to the United States and handed them over to a Polish man named Branstad, who was well-known in Shanghai. It is said that this person had already gone to the United States at that time. According to the confession, the anti-smuggling authorities placed the woman in a hotel here to attract accomplices. The woman used a trick to escape, took a plane to New York, boarded a German ship, and was about to sail to Europe, but was still arrested by agents. On the ship, the woman tried to jump into the port to commit suicide, but was also unsuccessful. At the same time, after investigations by both the United States and Shanghai, it was known that the Polish man, Branstad, provided by Warmary was not entirely accurate. Although Branstad had left Shanghai at that time, he had not yet arrived in the United States, because he detoured through Rome and Barcelona to Cuba, and then flew to Mexico, intending to enter the United States from the southern border to meet Warmary, but was sent back to Cuba by the Mexican authorities. According to reports from the local police station, the Cuban bureau also did not accept him, so he went to New York. Presumably, he had learned of Warmary's arrest on the way, so he did not arrive in New York and hanged himself. Therefore, the New York Federal agents only obtained Branstad's body. Later, Warmary continued to confess that she and Branstad were both hired by a man named Stie, who was formerly an accountant at the Shanghai Baolong Hospital, and all the smuggling plans were directed by him. When Shanghai wanted to arrest Stie, Stie had disappeared. However, several weeks later, he was found in a vacant lot in the French Concession of Shanghai, unconscious from poisoning, and died the next day without saying a word. It is still unknown whether Stie was also a tool. The date of the trial of Warmary's case has been postponed several times, once because the woman was ill, and once because the defense lawyer went elsewhere, and only arrived in court last week to be tried. However, the woman was still unable to walk due to illness, and was brought from the prison hospital to the court in a sedan chair. Shortly after the trial began, the woman fainted, so the trial was postponed again to this week. The judge's verdict has not yet been announced today. (National News Agency, 8th)</p>
<h3>Mussolini to Tour North Africa Next Spring: To Preside Over Highway Opening Ceremony</h3>
<p>(Rome) It is reported that Prime Minister Mussolini will travel to Italian Libya in North Africa in March next year. The newly built highway there, which extends to Tunisia in French territory, is expected to be completed by then, and the Prime Minister will preside over the opening ceremony. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<h3>Japan Cracks Down on International Counterfeit Currency Ring: Leader, a Danish National, Arrested in Yokohama, Travels Between Shanghai, Yokohama, and San Francisco</h3>
<p>(Yokohama) The Kanagawa Prefectural Police Department learned that a Danish man named Uldal, who often travels between Shanghai, Yokohama, and San Francisco, had been secretly investigating his activities. On November 27th, they saw him enter Yokohama Port on the Tatsuta Maru and arrested him. After continuous interrogation, they learned that this person had formed a group with more than a dozen Americans, French, Argentinians, White Russians, etc. residing in Shanghai, Tokyo, and Yokohama, and acted as their leader, counterfeiting 15 million yuan of Chinese Central Bank banknotes, and wanted to speculate on silver bars in the international city of Shanghai, hoping to make huge profits. The entire picture of the international currency counterfeiting ring has now been revealed. In addition to the aforementioned Danish national as the leader, there are shipping insurers residing in Shanghai, lawyers residing in Tokyo, and mechanical engineers residing in Yokohama. The currency counterfeiting ring was formed in Shanghai at the end of last year. They first decided to purchase machines in Japan and prepared everything. In March of this year, they came to Japan to purchase machines and hired technicians and workers. The factory was decided to be established in Dalian. On the 6th of this month, they raised another 15,000 yuan and completed the plan. On November 27th, they arrived in Yokohama from Shanghai on the Tatsuta Maru and immediately began to implement the counterfeiting ring's plan, but were eventually arrested by the Kanagawa Prefectural Foreign Affairs Section. This shocking international currency counterfeiting ring was thus cracked before it could be carried out. (Domei News Agency, 9th)</p>

<h3>Under Certain Party's Instigation, Bandit Puppets in Chahar Provoking Trouble, Imminent Invasion; Certain Party's Regular Army Stationed in Northern Chahar, Wang Ying Indeed Under House Arrest in Shangdu</h3>
<p>Zhangbei Correspondence, after suffering a defeat last month when the bandits and puppets raised by a certain party once invaded, they have recently launched a counterattack against Bailingmiao. Now, the party has realized that the National Army's defenses there are solid and the soldiers are brave, and knowing that it will be difficult to succeed quickly in a sudden attack, it has changed its strategy. It will combine the remnants of Wang Ying's bandit forces, numbering 4,000, and more than 2,000 bandits from Jehol into one force, and still attempt to advance westward from the area of Wuchuan and Guyang in northern Suiyuan. At the same time, it will focus on Taolin and Xinghe in southern Suiyuan, hoping to seize Guisui and Pingdiquan to cut off the traffic on the PingSui Railway, the transportation of the Suiyuan Army, and the roads for the National Army to aid Suiyuan. It will also drive all the bandits and puppets in northern Chahar to the front lines as substitute victims for its invasion. All the important areas in the rear of northern Chahar are garrisoned by its regular army and Jehol bandits, and in order to realize this plan, it has been mobilizing frequently in recent days. The various bandit puppet troops are not yet fully aware of its sinister intentions, and appear active on the surface. The current situation in northern Chahar is described below:</p>
<p>Dohihara Secretly Arrives at Jiabusi Temple</p>
<p>Former head of the Japanese Kwantung Army Special Service Agency, Kenji Dohihara, secretly arrived at the government in Jiabusi Temple from an unknown location at an unknown time. He has been holding secret meetings with the political councilors of a certain puppet alliance, the head of a certain service agency, and the military leaders of the various bandit puppet troops for several days. It is rumored that Dohihara will leave Jiabusi Temple within a few days to go to Tianjin to make a statement to the supreme leader of a certain garrison army. The current Jiabusi Temple has become the rear center of the bandit puppet army. All the planes stationed at the Zhangbei Airfield have now been moved westward, most of them are stationed in Jiabusi Temple, and a small part is stationed in Shangdu. It is estimated that there are about 50 planes from a certain country participating in the Suiyuan border battles. The large quantities of ammunition, military supplies, and provisions originally stored in Shangdu have been transported by truck to Jia Kasi Temple for storage since the 1st of this month. A certain party has been mobilizing laborers to build gasoline depots and expand the area of the airfield in Jia Kasi Temple overnight, but due to the extremely cold weather, the construction is extremely difficult.</p>
<p>Deployment of Bandit Puppet Troops</p>
<p>The various bandit puppet Mongol and Jehol troops in northern Chahar have been busy with deployments in recent days. After a certain party issued salaries to the various bandit troops in Jiabusi Temple on the 1st of this month, there were rumors that the third general offensive against the Suiyuan border would begin before the 10th of this month. It is estimated that more than 3,000 troops from Jehol bandit Jun Zhezhe's forces advanced westward from Weichang in stages on the 2nd and arrived near Bailingmiao on the 5th to participate in the counterattack against Bailingmiao. Currently, there are more than 8,000 Mongol bandit troops stationed in Lamulengtai, most of whom are cavalry, about 6,000. The supervisory team formed by a certain party is currently stationed in Jiabusi Temple. A part of its regular army, more than 2,000 troops, arrived in Jiabusi Temple from Duolun on the evening of the 2nd, accompanied by more than 200 artillery soldiers, more than a dozen large and small cannons, and a machine gun team with more than a dozen machine guns, and are preparing to head to Taolin in eastern Suiyuan. Zhang HaiPeng's puppet troops, numbering 3,000, had completed their concentration in Battai, northeast of Taolin, on the 6th and are also preparing to participate in the westward invasion. The puppet troops of Li ShouXin's forces stationed in Daqinggou have been moving to Shangdu one after another since the 3rd. The remnants of Zhuo and Hai's forces stationed in Baochang, numbering more than 500, also arrived in Shangdu on the 5th. The cavalry of Wang Ying's bandit forces has all been sent to northern Suiyuan. Wang himself is now in Shangdu and has been placed under house arrest by a certain party. His movements are followed and monitored in secret. The total number of his troops is estimated to be less than 4,000. On the night of the 4th, a certain company commander of Wang's forces shot and killed a certain commander because of disagreements with the commander, and fled to the grasslands of northern Suiyuan at that time. More than 50 members of Zhang WanQing's bandit forces stationed in Nanhanchang carried guns and surrendered to the Suiyuan defense army in Xinghe on the night of the 5th.</p>
<p>Quantity of Bandit Puppet Military Supplies Transported</p>
<p>Zhangbei County is a strategically important location. A certain party supplies all the military supplies for the bandits and puppets, and although it is impossible to know the exact quantity, it can still be roughly estimated. On the 4th of this month, a convoy of more than 60 trucks, 20 of which were loaded with ammunition and other military supplies, and 30 of which were loaded with provisions and other military supplies, were all transported from Duolun to Jia Kasi Temple. Ten or more trucks of bombs and artillery shells, all of which had the words "Made by a Certain Factory in a Certain Country" and "Made in Manchukuo" printed on the ammunition boxes. At noon on the 4th, more than 20 trucks of mechanical oil and gasoline were transported from Zhangbei to Shangdu and Jia Kasi Temple. On the morning of the 5th, there were ten trucks of military supplies and more than 500 barrels of gasoline transported from Zhangbei to Shangdu. In addition, there are about 60 aircraft with the emblems of a certain country and the puppet state that are said to have been transferred from the Northeast to Duolun Airfield.</p>
<p>The People of Zhangbei Suffer Greatly</p>
<p>The bandits and puppets in northern Chahar have recently been demanding heavily from the people, such as conscripting laborers, carts, mules, and horses every day. The puppet troops of Li ShouXin's forces in Zhangbei City are even worse, extorting merchants, and everyone hates them. Li recently demanded 100 catties of white flour from each of the 60 to 70 noodle shops in the city every day, giving only the official price of 7 yuan and 5 jiao. 6,000 to 7,000 catties of white flour are exported every day. Other grains are also conscripted from time to time, causing panic among the people over food. Recently, a small group of bandits, numbering about 100, has been discovered in the Miaotan area, constantly looting, so the people inside and outside the city are unable to live in peace. They deeply hope that the National Army will arrive soon to relieve this suffering. Furthermore, recently, a certain party is deeply afraid that its rear will be attacked by the National Army, and has ordered all the puppet agencies to strictly protect the various communication agencies and military equipment projects, and the situation is extremely concerning.

<h3>Guangdong Construction Bureau Director Liu Weichi Discusses Guangdong Province Construction: Adjusting Guangdong's Grain Supply with Surplus Grain from Neighboring Provinces; Private Citizens Can Undertake the Operation of Province-Run Factories; Silk Industry Loan Plan Specifies Three Steps</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Since Liu Weichi became the head of the Construction Bureau of Guangdong Province, he has been very proactive in planning and implementing construction projects. Recently, according to Mr. Liu's detailed account of the latest progress in the construction undertakings of Guangdong Province, the details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Relief of Grain Supply</p>
<p>The grain supply in this province is quite scarce, coupled with a poor late harvest this year. After the four provinces of Guangdong, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui jointly proposed economic cooperation, the grain that this province lacks will be addressed by organizing a grain transport company to transport surplus grain from various provinces. Because the measures for selling Hunan rice in Guangdong have not yet been finalized, it is proposed to start with Jiangxi first. However, this matter still needs to be considered. Originally, using the surplus from other provinces to supplement the shortage in this province is an excellent idea. Moreover, abundant harvests are related to weather conditions. Although this province has experienced a poor harvest this year, neighboring provinces have had good harvests. Mutual assistance is the only way to adjust and enrich the grain supply. However, recently, some people have advocated reducing the import tax on foreign rice to allow sufficient foreign rice to enter the market for adjustment purposes. However, I still believe that transporting rice from neighboring provinces to Guangdong for relief is a better option. Before these two methods are finalized, the grain problem in this province still needs to be discussed and there is no thorough solution yet.</p>
<p>Inviting Private Operation of Province-Run Factories</p>
<p>Regarding the private operation of province-run factories, this idea is indeed under consideration. For industries operated by the government, if it is deemed that merchants have the ability to handle them, it is more appropriate for merchants to operate them. However, larger-scale projects must be undertaken by the government. The factories recently established by the government do not offer any particular advantages because it has now been decided that both public and private factories must pay all kinds of taxes equally. Moreover, existing merchants are quite willing to take over. Previously, the responsibility for the operation and equipment of various province-run factories rested with the Construction Bureau. Now, the Construction Bureau has established a General Management Office and a Supervisory Committee for province-run industries. In the future, the development plans for factories and the procurement of raw materials will be handled by these two organizations. After these two organizations complete the procedures, they will submit them to the provincial government for discussion at the provincial affairs meeting. After multiple procedures and designs by various organizations, the question becomes whether the equipment of the province-run factories will be suitable and thorough. It is not just a matter of setting up responsibilities. For all undertakings, finance and economics must support each other. Finance should consider economics, and economics should also consider finance. They cannot be discussed separately. In short, I believe that province-run factories that private citizens are capable of operating should still be handed over to private citizens for operation. The government can reduce the preparation of a large amount of working capital, and the national economy can develop.</p>
<p>Developing Qiongya</p>
<p>Regarding the development of Qiongya's industry, the government currently does not have definite capital, so it now advocates encouraging private investment. The government has decided to start with facilitating transportation for the development of Qiongya's development plan. The Qiongya Island highway has already been completed, but due to a lack of funding, the bridge equipment has not yet been constructed. According to the budget, building with cement would require 700,000 to 800,000 yuan, while using fir wood would require more than 100,000 yuan. In addition to allocating funds from the road construction budget, the rest is still being raised. In the future, it will be repaid from the profits of the transport plan. As for the future development plan for Qiongya transportation, in addition to ordering the Qiongya Highway Traffic Management Office to step up its work, there are also plans to build seaports and large docks to facilitate the berthing of ships. In addition, there are also plans to build railways or wide highways to connect with all sides. Chairman Song's recent trip to Qiong also decided to imitate and implement the Qiongya development plan. He is now going to inspect it in order to implement it. As for the Xisha and Nansha Islands, which are rich in seaweed, they have long been coveted by foreigners who often steal them. The government has designed preventive measures to prevent resources from being taken away.</p>
<p>Water and Steel Plants</p>
<p>The Weng River Hydropower Plant was previously designed by the authorities, but due to the huge scale of the project and the large amount of funding required, construction has not yet begun. If the power plant is completed in the future, it will be able to thoroughly solve problems such as rural water conservancy. I believe that even if foreign capital is used to handle it when the government is temporarily unable to do so, it is still acceptable. The total cost requires more than 50 million yuan, which the government cannot afford for the time being. Regarding the progress of the steel plant, it has been decided to start with technical and financial aspects first. After technician He from this bureau went to Beijing for instructions, it was decided that this province should continue to handle it, and the central authorities will provide appropriate subsidies, and so on.</p>
<p>Silk Industry Loans</p>
<p>In order to revitalize the rural economy, Liu Weichi, in order to save the silk industry in Guangdong Province, specially planned silk industry loans with the Provincial Bank and the Bank of Communications. After several consultations and dispatching personnel to various villages to investigate, Liao Chongzhen, Director of the Silk Improvement Bureau of the Construction Bureau, put forward opinions for the reference of the Provincial and Jiaotong Bank authorities. At present, the negotiations have been generally completed and will be implemented as soon as they are approved. The loan plan is divided into three parts, which will be carried out in sequence. The methods are roughly as follows: The first step is to launch yarn and silk weaving loans. The method is to first select the Lunzhen area, which already has sound cooperatives, for a pilot project. If it is effective, it will be promoted to the silk weaving concentrated areas such as Minle, Shajiao, and Huanglian for a pilot project. The steps are divided into two phases: (1) First, grant loans to existing cooperatives for transportation and sales, and production credit loans, so that they can expand their organization and increase services, and call on more than 400 weaving households in Lunzhen (about 2,600 looms) to join the cooperative, run their own drying yards, so that they can dry black viscose yarn and silk by themselves (that is, self-made finished products), and organize their own sales departments to directly connect with sales in Shanghai, Nanyang and other places. (2) After Lunzhen has been successfully handled, gradually promote it to Minle, Shajiao, Huanglian and other places, and use loans to reward weaving households to improve existing machinery and technology, and manufacture new products obtained from the regional research institutes of the silk industry in Lunzhen and Minle. In accordance with the previous method, the finished products are graded and directly transported to other ports, so that they can meet the needs of the times, in order to seek the survival and development of the Guangdong yarn and silk weaving industry. The second step is to launch machinery silk reeling industry loans. The method is also divided into two phases: (1) Unite existing silk factories to organize a cooperative foreign trade agency. Each silk factory is a member of the cooperative foreign trade agency, reeling the same grade of raw silk and unifying direct foreign trade. Before the products of each factory reach the purchase period, the bank will allow the mortgage of its raw silk or factory properties, and provide financial accommodation to facilitate turnover. (2) United cooperation with the foreign trade agency members, all factory reconstruction, and installation of new machinery, procurement of improved raw materials, and manufacturing of high-grade raw silk, still according to the previous method to unify the product grade and common foreign trade. The reconstruction costs of its factory machinery, etc., are loaned by the banking industry for 70%, and the remaining 30% is raised by the members themselves, or requested by the government for subsidies. The rent obtained by the factory should be used to pay off the principal and interest of the banking industry in installments in advance. Before it is paid off, the factory will be used as a guarantee for the banking industry's 70% investment. The third step is to launch seed production and silkworm raising industry cooperative loans. The method is that the silkworm improvement area and the banking industry will jointly promote the establishment of the cooperative. The former is responsible for technical improvement and organizational guidance, and the latter is responsible for the audit of accounts. Each member of the cooperative should provide mutual guarantees, so that credit production loans can be carried out, and all products of the members will be handed over to the cooperative for joint transportation and sales. As for the silkworm raising cooperative, it should also establish close contact with the silk reeling factory in order to reduce the exploitation of middlemen.</p>
<h3>Active Municipal Facilities in the Capital: Feces Management and Expansion of the Municipal Railway</h3>
<p>Nanjing Communication: The Municipal Government held a memorial week for the Prime Minister at 8:00 a.m. on the first day of this week. All staff members were present, chaired by Secretary-General Wang Shufang. After leading the ceremony, Councilor Zhang Jianming reported on three matters handled and participated in by basic staff: (1) Regarding the first membership solicitation of the Municipal Air Defense Association, it was briefly stated that since the Municipal Air Defense Association held the first membership solicitation meeting on September 15, a total of more than 880 teams have been established by the end of November. The number of members solicited this time was originally set at 100,000, including all sectors of the Party, government, military, police, and academia. Ordinary members are limited to citizens who have received training, so the initial handling felt very simple. However, later, many citizens automatically requested to join, and the number of natural members from all sectors was more than the original number of 100,000. Therefore, as a result, the association issued eight registration books and more than 100,000 copies. About 80,000 people have officially joined after paying their membership fees, which proves that the citizens of this city have a considerable understanding of the importance of air defense, which is worthy of our attention. (2) Regarding the management of feces in this city, it was briefly stated that since the Feces Management Office of this city was officially opened on July 5, it was first tried out in the third and fifth districts, and improved from time to time. Initially, it was stipulated that feces collectors should collect feces from house to house, transport them to the various feces boat docks on the Qinhuai River, load them into feces boats and transport them to Shuixi Gate, and use feces pumps to pump them out of the city and hand them over to merchants for sale. According to the statistics, there are more than 50,000 households in the third and fifth districts, but only more than 8,000 households collect feces in accordance with the regulations by feces collectors, accounting for only one-sixth of the total. The reasons are that a very small number of households use flush toilets and do not need feces collectors to collect feces, and a small number of households have vegetable gardens for their own use, or have septic tank equipment to dispose of them by themselves. Most households, either because they are close to the toilet, or because they are poor, want to save costs and secretly dump and wash them. Now, in order to unify management, the Feces Management Office has specially formulated rules for tidying up and managing toilets, and announced and implemented them, registering all toilets in the city, and absolutely prohibiting the dumping and washing of toilets in the toilets, because without such measures, the feces problem in this city cannot be uniformly controlled, and there is no possibility of thorough improvement. As for the various feces boat docks on the Qinhuai River in the city, which citizens have complained about, if they are all canceled and docks are set up on the moat outside the city, it will be possible to implement them soon. In short, the feces management in this city is still in the early stages, and it is hoped that citizens will do their best to assist in order to achieve perfection. If you have any opinions, please also give more instructions to the organizers of the office, so that they can adopt and implement them. (3) Regarding the expansion of the municipal railway, it was briefly stated that the expansion project of the municipal railway has now been completed. The situation has been reported to you before. Recently, the negotiation of joint transportation with the Jiangnan Railway Company has been generally agreed upon and will be implemented soon. The municipal railway has now been opened to Jiankang Road, and will be opened to Wudingmen next week. In the future, after the joint transportation with the Jiangnan Railway, it can directly reach Sunjiabu in Anhui. As for the joint transportation with the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, the mayor sent a letter to the Ministry of Railways and proposed four methods: 1. The Beijing Railway will set up a track at Jinchuan Gate to connect with the municipal railway. 2. The railway department and the municipal government will cooperate in the Central Street Station of the municipal railway. 3. The Central Street Station of the municipal railway will be the central station to accommodate vehicles from all aspects entering the city. The railway department and the municipal government will jointly manage it. 4. The railway department will try various methods to make full use of the municipal railway. Recently, a reply letter from the Ministry of Railways was received, expressing its agreement to the principle of making full use of the municipal railway. Regarding the expansion of the municipal railway and the Central Street Station, it is hoped that the municipal government will operate and manage it alone. Regarding the connection between the Beijing-Shanghai Railway at Jinchuan Gate and the municipal railway, it is argued that the connection with the municipal railway should still be at Xiaguan Station. The reason is that if the connection is made at Jinchuan Gate, the timetable must be rearranged, which is very inconvenient, and Xiaguan Station already has very perfect facilities, which is easy to do. Regarding this point, our research results show that there is no major relationship between the connection of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway at Jinchuan Gate or Xiaguan with the municipal railway. However, it will take 20 more minutes to transfer to the municipal railway at Xiaguan. According to the actual situation, except for a very small number of passengers who get off at Hepingmen because they have their own cars to save time and avoid noise, most people will be happy to use the train if it can drive into the city. Therefore, this fact is not a problem. Now, the municipal government intends to actively reorganize the old road section of the municipal railway, such as replacing sleepers, replacing steel rails, repairing bridges, and repairing houses at Xiaguan and Central Street stations, so that it can realize traffic with the Beijing-Shanghai Railway as soon as possible to benefit the citizens.</p>
<h3>Jiading</h3>
<p>Release of Rice Boats on the Wusong River</p>
<p>The county government recently received an order from the provincial government prohibiting the expenditure of rice grain from the province. At Jiwang Temple Laogang, the intersection of Jiangsu Province and Shanghai City, on the Wusong River, since the beginning of the month, hundreds of rice boats have been detained in accordance with the order for several days. Now, on the 8th, an order from the provincial government has been received and all have been released. After most of the rice boats have been opened to Shanghai, the navigation of the Wusong River to the north has also returned to normal.</p>
<p>Theft by Bandits in the Nanguang Township</p>
<p>At midnight on the 5th, the house of Xu Yunsheng, a farmer in Xujiachi, Nanguang Township, Second District, was suddenly broken into by twelve bandits with a Jiangbei accent. After being robbed of 40 yuan in legal tender, they broke into the house of Yang Xiaoyi in the same village, tied Yang up, and fled after robbing him.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Police Officer's Jealousy and Murder Case</p>
<p>Yang Chunyi, a policeman in the First Squadron of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, from Bengbu, Anhui, had been living with a woman named Shen Cuie. In July last year, Shen Cuie abandoned the old and changed to the new, and lived with Zhang Longhai. Because of being lovelorn, Yang tried to commit suicide with a pistol but failed. On July 15 of the same year, he took a fake leave from the team, carried a box gun, and went to Zhang Hailong's house at No. 131 Hetan Pavilion Road, Jiangwan Town, and shot Zhang Hailong and his mistress Shen Cuie to death, and injured Shen Cuie's sister Shen Xiaomei. Later, he abandoned his uniform and box gun in Tongle Lane, Hongkou, and fled without a trace. In September of this year, Yang Chunyi wrote a letter from Bengbu, Anhui, to Shen Xiaomei, expressing his apology and asking that the past be spared from prosecution. After receiving the letter, Shen Xiaomei reported to the Municipal Public Security Bureau and notified the Bengbu Public Security Bureau of Anhui to arrest Yang and send him to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau for transfer to the Shanghai Local Court for trial. He was sentenced to life imprisonment for the crime of murder. The prosecutor believed that Yang Chunyi continuously premeditated murder, and the sentence was too light, so he appealed to the Jiangsu High Court. The Second Criminal Court held a hearing yesterday afternoon, and Shen Xiaomei also appeared in court and appointed lawyer Zhuang Pengnian to defend Yang. As a result, the sentence will be announced on the 14th of this month.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Meat Merchants Request Exemption from Business Tax</p>
<p>The Business Tax Collection Bureau of this county believes that the sale of fresh meat by meat merchants, or the production and sale of cooked meat, is obviously another business activity and should be subject to business tax in accordance with the regulations. However, the meat industry believes that the slaughter of pigs is entirely self-slaughtered and self-sold, and is not purchased from others, which seems to be different from the general situation of so-called concurrent operation. Therefore, it sent a letter to the County Chamber of Commerce, requesting that it forward a letter to the Business Tax Bureau to exempt it from collection in order to relieve merchants' difficulties. After receiving the letter, the Chamber of Commerce stated that since the meat industry in Wuxi is self-slaughtered and self-sold, it is difficult to say that it is another business activity. If it is said that taxes are being collected, officials and merchants specially sent a letter to the Tax Bureau, requesting that from January next year, the method of Zhao Wu County be followed to assess and collect taxes from larger cooked meat stores, and also asked them to consider the difficulties of merchants and not to be harsh.</p>
<p>Printing Workers Strike</p>
<p>The accounting book printing company of Pan Jinfeng in Jiangyin Lane outside the North Gate of this county is opened by Tao Wenbing. There are more than 10 workers. However, Tao is usually harsh to people. Recently, the working hours have reached 17 hours, and the internal wages are uneven, which has caused dissatisfaction among the workers, who believe that it violates the printing regulations. Therefore, each worker submitted four requests to the owner, and after receiving no satisfactory answer, they went on strike on the 5th of this month, and requested relief from the Printing Industry Association. After the association mediated between labor and management, there was no result, and the situation became deadlocked. On the 9th, all the workers of the office petitioned the Party and government authorities for relief. However, if this case is not resolved early, it is feared that it will affect the overall situation of the printing industry in the county.</p>

<p>Cotton Firms Stop Weighing Due to Losses</p>
<p>Cotton in Tong County has had a bumper harvest this year. Due to the competition among cotton merchants, the market price has soared, sometimes even higher than Shanghai. Most of the cotton transported to Shanghai and Wuxi has been lost. Various firms once jointly raised the weighing scale to suppress the rise in price. However, cotton farmers, unable to obtain high prices, have stored the cotton in the farmers' warehouses, waiting for a good price in the coming spring. At the moment, the goods arriving in the villages are scarce, and the firms do not dare to accept cotton during the period of low prices and high prices. They have stopped weighing and collecting cotton.</p>

<p>Former Qing Dynasty Patrol Captain Extorted Money</p>
<p>Sun Xianglin, a native of Suining, once served as the captain of the Patrol Team in this county. Now he has been demoted to a third-level policeman in the Second Direct Sub-station. On the 5th, he still used the name of the Patrol Captain and took Qin Yingxi, a policeman from the Fourth Sub-station, to the house of Guo Liansheng outside the West Gate, using the excuse of catching gambling to extort money and divide it among themselves. The matter was heard by a patrol team of the Security Police Corps. The captain of the team, Lang Huizhang, reported to Director Zhang and arrested Sun and others. At 3:00 p.m. on the 8th, Han Rushen, the section chief of the Judicial Section, opened a trial. Because Sun Xianglin was the captain of the Patrol Team and is now a policeman, and policeman Qin Yingxi should not have such behavior, he prepared a document together with the witness Liu Chunrong and sent them to the District Procuratorate for investigation under police escort.</p>

<p>Continuing to Reorganize Anfeng Pond</p>
<p>Anfeng Pond in Shouxian County, northern Anhui, also known as Shao Pond, was created by Sun Shu'ao, the Chu prime minister in the Spring and Autumn Period. It is a famous water conservancy area since ancient times. Its management is actually earlier than the Northwest Qin Canal, Han Canal, Zheng Canal, and Bai Canal. Initially, it irrigated 1 million mu of land, or 400,000 mu, and gradually fell into disuse over time. Now only more than 100,000 mu of irrigated area remain. Its water source is one to draw water from the Pi River, and the other is to receive mountain water. Later, because the path of the Pi River was blocked, the irrigated area shrank day by day. The Anhui Provincial Government plans to restore the old state. After sending personnel to survey and design the reorganization, the construction methods are: A. Dredge the bottom of the canal for drawing the Pi River to half a meter below the dry water level, with a width of two meters, and extend the original spillway dam. A total of 121,231 yuan is required for four types of construction costs. Type B requires 61,043 yuan. The provincial government adopted four types of methods and allocated funds to build it last year. The first phase of earthwork engineering was organized by the Huai River Guidance Committee. The second phase of the project has been transferred from the Huai River Guidance Committee to the Provincial Government for organization. Ma Jidi, the magistrate of Shouxian County, believes that although the dredging project of the Pi River source has been completed, the intake culvert and the repair of the pond and river embankment must be continued to promote irrigation effectiveness. He specially telegraphed the Construction Department a few days ago, asking for personnel to be sent to preside over the construction. The Construction Department replied by telegram, stating that the soil and rock engineering for the Anfeng Pond pond embankment and river embankment had previously been approved by the Huai River Guidance Committee, and the Water Conservancy Engineering Department was ordered to handle it. According to the construction methods proposed by the department, the Huai River Guidance Committee was transferred to allocate funds for the case. It is now waiting for the funds to arrive for construction. It is now heard that before the construction starts, the Anfeng Pond Pond Construction Committee has been ordered to reorganize to facilitate the project.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Continuing to Build Yongrui Ping Road</p>
<p>Yongrui Ping Highway is an important transportation route from Wenzhou directly to the provincial capital. Construction began as early as last year, but it was suspended halfway due to financial difficulties. The Construction Department now believes that the earthwork of the road has been completed, and in order to continue the project, it has specially approved the central government to allocate 100,000 yuan for engineering expenses. The remaining 300,000 yuan will be raised by the province itself. All bridge and road surface projects have been contracted to merchants and will be built soon. It is expected to be completed and opened to traffic in February next year.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Grain: Rumors of Foreign Wheat Being Ordered; Wheat Flour Once Slightly Declined</h3>
<p>After the wheat market opened in the morning, it saw a sharp drop at one point. The quoted prices for foreign wheat were: Chicago down 1/4 to 1/10 of a cent, Canada down 2/10 of a cent. The market rumors of foreign wheat being ordered have been confirmed. It is said that two ships have been ordered at a price of $9.42. With this news, people's hearts became greatly worried. The December price fell by 14/100 of a cent, and the January to March prices also fell by about 1/10 of a cent. Although the market sentiment was loose, the speculative atmosphere was strong. Therefore, it immediately rebounded by 3-5/100 of a cent. Approaching the afternoon opening, it rose due to active buying from outside the industry, and the flour market also showed signs of rebounding. Therefore, the prices of each month rose steadily, only slightly lower than the previous closing price by 1-5/100 of a cent. This situation seems to imply an uncertain future and a difficult immediate loosening. The current wheat prices are still firm. The opening prices for wheat from various places are: Kaiyang He Yaowan wheat at $6.65, Hefei wheat at $6.54, Shaoxing wheat at $6.45 and $6.38 for the second grade, Dongtai wheat at $6.50, Daorenqiao wheat at $6.37, and Pudong wheat at $5.75 and $5.77 for the second grade. Fuxin is said to be handling 4,000 bags.</p>
<p>Highest Lowest Previous Closing Comparison</p>
<p>December $6.62 $6.66 $6.62 Down $0.05</p>
<p>January $6.80 $6.68 $6.79 Down $0.01</p>
<p>February $6.92 $6.78 $6.91 ...</p>
<p>March $7.00 $6.89 $6.99 ...</p>
<p>April $7.04 $6.99 $7.04 Down $1.01</p>
<p>After the flour market opened in the morning, the prices for each month saw a sharp drop at one point. The difference also reached the limit. The reason for this sharp drop is that the manufacturers here are said to have received a telegram confirming the ordering of two ships of Argentine wheat (one saying three ships) at a price of $9.42. At this time of surging price increases, it naturally suffered a blow. The December price fell by only 2/100 of a cent, the January price fell by 5-6/100 of a cent, the February price fell by 1/10 of a cent, and the opening price for March also fell by 1/10 of a cent. It immediately rebounded by 1 1/2/100 of a cent. The April price fell by 7-8/100 of a cent. After the first round, although the December price had fallen, the forward prices had been fixed. Because the large bulls outside the industry were still actively buying, the market was supported. By the time the afternoon opening came, it was initially calm, but later, because the bulls outside the industry believed that foreign wheat would be difficult to order and that the cost would ultimately be higher than the standard, they continued to buy regardless of the environment. Therefore, the prices for each month rebounded by 5-6/100 of a cent. The difference compared to the previous day was only about 2-3/100 of a cent. Under this situation, perhaps the manufacturer's continued ordering of foreign wheat cannot be stopped.</p>

<h3>Rice Boats Detained Are Gradually Released; River Rice Arrivals Surge</h3>
<p>35,000 Piculs of Rice Arrive in Southern Shanghai; Sales Are Brisk in Local Streets and Northern Areas; Arrival of Ke Xian Rice Causes Market Prices to Remain Steady</p>
<p>Northern Shanghai: Rice boats detained for several days in the Jiwang Temple area were released the night before last. Yesterday morning, nearly a hundred arrived at the gate, with more arriving later, which calmed people's minds. Market prices immediately dropped by one or two cents. Later, because buyers heard that Southern Shanghai still had strong demand, selling prices were quite firm. However, due to the relentless demand for exports, prices were difficult to lower. As shops had low inventories, prices moved slightly lower, and various goods in the market were active. Except for white粳, which was slightly lower than the highest price, Bo Dao and Zao Dao were selling well, and market prices were strong. Yang Du Jian was stable, and Ke Jian was in demand. Prices of other goods were weak, falling by a few cents to a dime. In the future, the prices of various goods are expected to tighten.</p>
<p>Southern Shanghai: Yesterday, due to the gradual opening of the gate for ships from various gangs that had been blocked in the Neijiang River, a surge of arrivals reached a total of 160 to 170, with a total of 34,000 to 35,000 piculs of goods. Among them, Bo Dao still accounted for the majority, with about 110 to 120 ships. Fortunately, demand was also strong. The Pingjin Qingyan and other gangs handled 13,000 to 14,000 packages of Bo Dao and more than 5,000 packages of Hou Geng. Local street sales were also good, so there were not many left, and almost all were cleared. However, after this round of purchases, demand was somewhat saturated, so the market became sluggish. As a result, the prices of Hou and Bo Geng were all fixed. Due to the lack of supply of Du Yang Jian and Yin Bian Yuan, they showed a beautiful color again, but the prices varied.</p>
<p>Ke Xian: Yesterday, the market for Ke Xian rice saw continued strong demand in the local streets, with囤戶 (speculators) continuing to inquire. Demand from Henan remained active, so there was a need for market prices to continue to rise. However, there was a strong arrival of new rice at the Yangtze River head the day before yesterday, with more than 10,000 packages arriving daily. Also, rice detained in Jiading and other places was all released. Some local and foreign buyers stopped to wait and see. As cargo owners had both existing and arriving goods, they were willing to sell according to the market. Therefore, the rising trend stopped. A total of 4,647 packages of Gan rice, 945 packages of Xiang rice, 3,000 packages of Wen Xian, and 350 packages of Jiaxing rice were released, with prices similar to those of the previous market.</p>
<h3>Sesame Prices Rise Several Times a Day</h3>
<p>The sesame market in洋荘 (foreign firms) was affected by news that a certain trust company was aggressively pricing in various producing areas, resulting in a significant impact on supply. Consequently, the exchange's standard market price was pushed up by speculators, and prices rose several times a day. Spot markets also saw aggressive activity by foreign firms, and the market was likely to rise sharply. 泮荘 (a type of sesame)净货 (net goods) were sold by He Yi Foreign Firm at 13.5 yuan for 200 tons. Yesterday, the price offered by an East Asian gang in the market reached 13.9 yuan, with 100 tons transacted. The overall situation was quite prosperous. There was a strong momentum to break through the 14 yuan barrier. Spot Mao Ma (raw sesame) from East Asian gangs and Shaoxing oil presses were also selling well. Yesterday's market saw transactions of about 1,600 to 1,700 packages.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Shorts Cover Profits, Spot Yarn Market Suddenly Tightens</h3>
<p>Yarn and cloth fell in the morning but rose at noon, and the momentum turned strong. After the market price fell back, shorts covered their positions, and large bullish investors absorbed and increased their stakes. Thus, both long and short sides moved forward side by side, causing the market to dry up and the market situation to tighten. In the afternoon, a cotton company purchased a large quantity of 8,000 packages, and rumors of positive news resurfaced, causing prices to rise again. However, spot yarn transactions were extremely weak.</p>
<p>Spot yarn futures rise by more than one yuan</p>
<p>Spot yarn futures opened in the morning, and the December market was flat and weak, trending downward. By the time of the auction, distant months rose by one yuan. In the second session, the December market suddenly rose by one yuan, and the far months plunged by more than two yuan. Because yarn sales were sluggish and the price had been rising sharply for several days, those who had made a profit flocked to sell.

As a result, this month fell sharply by three and a half yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, and far months fell by one yuan and two dimes to two yuan and two dimes.

However, the U.S. cotton fifth estimate was released, with production at 12,407,000 bales, an increase of 7,000 bales from the previous time. The market price was firm and rose by more than ten磅音 (points). As a result, people's minds were good, and the township prices were very strong, so the arrival of goods was slightly scarce.

<h3>Piece Goods: Various Types of Woolen Cloth Are Very Popular</h3>
<p>Shipments to Beijing, Hangzhou, and Other Places Are Very Strong; Business in Local Streets Is Also Brisk</p>
<p>Due to the cold weather recently, woolen cloth sales have been brisk. Sales in Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places are particularly good.

Clothing shops on Xiaoximen Daxin Street, Sichuan Road, Avenue Joffre, and overcoat workshops in the Ji畝地 area all have strong purchasing appetites. Shoe and hat shops in the city and other places are also purchasing and cutting. The wholesale and retail business of woolen cloth and the business of Western-style clothing gangs are currently very prosperous.</p>
<h3>Securities: Government Bonds Turn Weak After Being Firm and High</h3>
<p>The Result Is That All Except Bing Wu Still Rise by More Than One Dime</p>
<p>Yesterday, the government bond market on the Chinese Business Securities Exchange was volatile. The trend went from firm to weak, and the environment became dull. However, the market price was firm and high in the morning session, and large investors purchased a lot, so it continued to rise, and the rising trend was quite strong. By the afternoon session, a large investor in the financial industry suddenly sold a huge amount, and the market situation suddenly turned downward, and the market atmosphere also became weak. Because its chips have not yet been sold, there may be more setbacks in the future. Yesterday morning, because large investors such as numbers 35, 7, and 52 were enthusiastically buying, retail investors' minds were also boosted, and many bought. Market prices rose by three to five cents, and the four types in this month even rose by seven cents. However, numbers 10 and 43 sold. In the next session, the trend was still strong. Large investors such as numbers 23 and 13 continued to absorb a large amount. Wu and Ding rose again by one or two cents. After the two types, numbers 10 and 44 sold a lot and fell back by one or two cents. The four types in the next month rose by five cents. When the market opened in the afternoon, the situation suddenly turned weak. A large investor in the financial industry suddenly entrusted number 20 with a huge amount to sell at a limited price, and the market price suddenly fell by three dimes and a half and four dimes and a half. Numbers 11 and retail investors were still buying, and the closing market was firm with long and short sides holding each other, and the rise and fall were minimal. Number 47, on behalf of a large investor, also sold at a limited price, while retail investors and numbers 10 and 5 bought a lot, so the market price was mostly equal to the previous session. As a result of the day, except for the Wu type in this month, the main Bing far-term rose slightly by five cents, and the rest rose by about one dime. The total number of transactions was 9,410,000 yuan. The comparison of its ups and downs is listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: hundred yuan):</p>

<h3>Continuous Demand for Gongxi Tea</h3>
<p>The market already shows a supply shortage, a rare sight in recent years.</p>
<p>Gongxi silk tea has historically been primarily sold to Russia. In recent years, due to a sharp decline in sales from that source, tea merchants in various regions have changed their production methods, drastically reducing this year's Gongxi varieties to just over 30,000 boxes. Previously, due to active routes to India and continued procurement by Russian merchants, the market's existing stock was completely sold out. Recently, there have been multiple purchase requests from India, but supply cannot meet demand. This is an unprecedented situation in recent years. Zhenmei silk tea and local soil tea have also been mostly cleared out. Due to requests from abroad, firms such as Jinlong and Yihe are currently negotiating prices for one to two thousand boxes of incoming goods.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: New Quanzhou Sliced Qing Sugar Expected Soon</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trended flat. The guild’s prices were: No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar at 2.11.5 yuan per 50kg bag, transit sugar at 6.112 yuan. Dongbai sugar remained unchanged. However, No. 4 ( ) mark spot goods were 21.5 yuan. The factory’s refined white sugar was priced at 20.4 yuan. Guangdong and Chaozhou merchants offered over a hundred bags of "turned red" sugar at 14.215 to 14.115 yuan. Beihai sliced Qing sugar was also sold out at 10.4 yuan. The market outlook is tight, and it is reported that Quanzhou sliced Qing sugar will arrive soon.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the 合 company held its second tender for Guangdong sugar this week. The total quota was over 40,000 bags. They sold 590 bags of Shunde factory's Five Rams coarse white sugar at 21.3 yuan, and another 100 bags from the 市 factory at 21.1 yuan. The remaining sugar was not sold at the original price.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous: Despite Diplomatic Tensions, Japanese Imports Surge - How Should Japan Maintain Its Advantage?</h3>
<p>In the past two months, despite Sino-Japanese diplomatic tensions and continued incitement of the Northeast border war, Japanese imports have surged more than before. The most significant categories include earthenware, lead sheets, lead blocks, bleaching powder, sulfuric acid, and salted fish. From Sunday to yesterday, there were three rounds of imports, totaling over 10,000 tons. It is reported that there are approximately 22,000 bags of sugar. Additionally, a Japanese ship that arrived yesterday carried over 1,000 packages of rayon, valued at over 300,000 yuan, in addition to sugar, lead sheets, and salted fish. Furthermore, in the past two months, Japanese imports have jumped to the top position. However, Japan remains unwilling to change its mindset and methods. If it were to drastically alter its plans, it could maintain its prosperity in trade with China for a long time. However, it does not pay attention to this, which is truly a pity.</p>

The purpose of the One Day's Income Contribution Campaign in this city is to contribute the strength of the people to enrich national defense, which is a very good intention. The committee has now designated December 12th as the Shanghai citizens' One Day's Income Contribution Campaign day, which is feasible. It is appropriate to issue a joint announcement, urging all sectors of the city to comply. Except for those who have already contributed one day's income and have receipts from the receiving agencies, all citizens are urged to donate generously, and they must submit their salary income, business income, or profit income of that day to the designated Central, China, Communications, Shanghai, and Shanghai City Banks for collection, so as to gather strength and enrich our national defense. We have high hopes for this, and we hereby announce this."</p>
<p>Notice to Compatriots Issued by the Promotion Committee</p>
<p>The One Day's Income Contribution to the Nation Campaign Promotion Committee of this city issued a notice to compatriots yesterday, stating, "Dear compatriots, since the 'September 18th' Incident, our nation and people have been oppressed and invaded by others. Now, violent people are employing conspiracies and deceit to induce bandits and puppets to be their vanguard and invade our Suiyuan. For the sake of preserving the survival of the nation, the soldiers at the front are sacrificing their lives, fighting bloody battles with bandits and puppets in the icy and snowy lands. For a month, they have recovered Bailing Temple and Honggeertu, restoring our territory and establishing meritorious service beyond the Great Wall. Their blood has nurtured brilliant flowers and fruits, which deserves our infinite admiration and joy. However, when we think of our compatriots who are also Chinese, the soldiers at the front are charging into battle, bravely killing enemies, with severed limbs and remains lying on the battlefield. Can we, the compatriots in the rear, sit idly by? Now the weather is extremely cold. We feel cold even in our houses, so we can imagine how much harder it is for them to fight for the country in the fierce deserts of wind and snow. Since we cannot go to the front lines and share their hardships, we can only help them materially to show our respect and condolences. We firmly believe that all patriotic compatriots are thinking of those brave soldiers at the front who are killing enemies for the country and want to actively comfort them, giving them spiritual and material comfort to show that our spirit is connected with them. Therefore, in view of the patriotic enthusiasm of compatriots from all walks of life, we have launched the One Day's Income Campaign. The significance of the One Day's Income Campaign is to have all the people of the country rise up to assist the government in completing this great mission of suppressing bandits, resisting insults, and saving the country. Because the income of one person for one day is limited, but the concentrated one-day income of the people of the whole country is a very large number. Compatriots in the rear only sacrifice one day's income, while the soldiers at the front receive the condolences of compatriots in the rear, which can increase their courage to kill the enemy, and the effect will be great. Compatriots, the enemy is deep and the situation is urgent. The survival of the nation and people has reached a critical moment. One day's income is the minimum sacrifice that we citizens can make for the nation and people. Please rise up quickly and contribute your one day's income to the government to comfort the front lines, so as to show the great spirit of self-reliance of our Chinese nation. (Note) Please send the One Day's Income donation directly to the Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, Shanghai City Bank, and Shanghai Commercial Bank to receive a receipt. Manufactured by the One Day's Income Contribution to the Nation Campaign Promotion Committee of Shanghai City."</p>
<p>Agencies and Organizations Take the Lead</p>
<p>The promotion committee sent letters to various agencies and organizations, inviting them to take the lead in promoting the campaign among their employees and members. The letter stated, "Dear Sirs, The second item discussed at the second committee meeting of our committee was to designate December 12th as the day for the Shanghai citizens' One Day's Income Contribution Campaign, with attached measures for review. The resolution has been passed, and the meeting minutes have been printed and distributed. Regarding the progress, in addition to sending letters to party and government agencies, jointly issuing announcements to inform the general public to donate generously, and inviting various newspapers and radio stations to promote widely, and our committee issuing a notice to citizens to promote attention among all citizens, it seems that all agencies and organizations participating in our committee should take the lead in promoting the campaign, collecting the one-day income of their members and employees on that day, and submitting it to the bank designated by our committee to facilitate the process. In addition to sending separate letters, we hereby inform you, hoping that you will take note and handle it accordingly."</p>
<p>Designated Banks Collect Donations</p>
<p>The promotion committee previously resolved to invite the municipal government, the bankers' association, the accountants' association, the general labor union, the united university association, the citizen's association of the first special district, and the secondary school association to serve as donation management committee members, and designated the Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, Shanghai City Bank, and Shanghai Bank as donation collection agencies. It is now reported that the donation collection receipts have been sent to each of the banks. Agencies and organizations that have one-day campaign donations can send them to the Central Bank on the Bund, the Bank of China on Sanma Road, the Communications Bank on the Bund, the City Bank on Tianjin Road, and the Laosimen, Xinkaihe, and City Center branches of that bank, the Shanghai Bank on Ningbo Road, and the various branches and offices of that bank in this city for collection and withdrawal of receipts. It is also learned that the banks will immediately report to the association and publish the donations received in the newspapers.</p>
<h3>Pang Jingzhou's Telegram: The Front Lines Urgently Need Supplies; North China Rescue Branch Established</h3>
<p>When the Suiyuan war began, the general headquarters of the Chinese Red Cross Society in this city dispatched personnel to the front lines to inspect the condition of the wounded soldiers and implement rescue work. However, the local medicines and equipment were severely lacking. They telegraphed the headquarters to quickly prepare them and send a team to strengthen the effort. Personnel were dispatched to consult with various local groups on expanding the rescue work. It was generally agreed that the rescue work at the front lines was of great importance and that the name of the organization should be unified. It was deemed appropriate to strictly control the organization and ensure consistent use of the Red Cross flag and armband for identification to avoid disrupting military operations. The current policy of the association is: (1) to produce more wound dressings for use by wounded soldiers in battle; (2) to rush-produce medicine bags for rescuers to administer first aid; (3) to establish more wounded soldier hospitals; (4) to establish surgical teams composed of specialized surgeons carrying large surgical instruments and X-rays to perform surgeries in various wounded soldier hospitals. In order to increase work efficiency and facilitate local operations, a North China Branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society Rescue Committee was established, inviting medical, pharmaceutical, commercial, and academic representatives from the Tianjin and Beijing areas to serve as committee members. It will be established soon. The association received a telegram from Pang Jingzhou from Suiyuan yesterday, stating that the local area is experiencing fierce north winds, snow-covered roads, and a need for warm clothing and bedding to be provided quickly. The vehicles and stretchers for transportation should also be rushed over. It is necessary to provide medicines such as cotton, gauze, bandages, yellow dye, carbolic acid, Lysol, hydrogen peroxide, knives, scissors, tweezers, injection solutions, and syringes. Because it is not easy to procure these in North China, the Shanghai headquarters must raise a large amount of materials. It is anticipated that a major war is imminent. Therefore, in addition to sending all stored items, the headquarters is actively soliciting the above materials, hoping that all sectors will quickly donate or assist in purchasing them with funds, so that they can be transported to the front lines as soon as possible to meet the urgent needs. Regardless of whether it is material or money, please send it to the Chinese Red Cross Society at 856 Xinzha Road. A receipt will be issued as proof. In addition to publishing thank-you notes and publishing a special record of credits, the general situation of rescue will be disclosed in the newspapers one by one.</p>
<h3>Relief Conference Resolves to Transport First Batch of Winter Supplies</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Local Self-Government Association, and Red Cross Society jointly formed the Suiyuan Bandit Suppression Relief and Rescue Committee and began collecting winter supplies, donations of silk wadded jackets, gloves, woolen shirts, etc., have been very enthusiastic. Yesterday, the executive committee resolved to transport the first batch, starting immediately. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The executive committee held its third executive meeting at 4 p.m. the day before yesterday. Xiao Lai, Du Yuesheng, Liu Hongsheng, Shao Yanshan, Lin Kanghou, Mu Ouchu, Jin Runxiang, Huang Renzhi, Yan Esheng, and others attended. Xiao Lai chaired the meeting. First, the general secretary reported on the amount of donations and goods received, and then announced the following cases for discussion: (1) Transportation of Relief Goods Case. It was resolved that the first batch of winter supplies should be transported starting immediately, and Jin Runxiang was appointed to handle the matter. (2) Measures for Handling Relief Work Case. It was resolved that the rescue work should be actively handled by the Red Cross Society Rescue Committee in conjunction with the Rescue Work Promotion Association. The medicines received by the committee will be transferred to the Red Cross Society Rescue Committee at any time for immediate transport. As for the collected medicine packs, those that have already been received will also be transported first.</p>
<p>Telegrams from Fu Zuoyi: The City Chamber of Commerce and Local Self-Government Association previously received a telegram from Fu Zuoyi, which stated: "Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce and Local Self-Government Association, The recent Suiyuan alarm has attracted nationwide concern. I am grateful for your encouragement and spiritual support. The three armies are inspired and strengthened. We will strive to inspire ourselves and bravely kill the enemy, hoping to be loyal to the party and the country and live up to the earnest expectations of our patriotic compatriots. Special telegram to express our gratitude. Hope you will understand. Fu Zuoyi, with respect."</p>
<h3>Joint Relief Association of Charitable Organizations Urges Donations of Money and Goods</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Joint Relief Association of Charitable Organizations in Shanghai on Yunnan Road has spared no effort in appealing for action. It is particularly concerned about the refugees in the Suiyuan disaster area and is now actively urging donations of money and goods, and sending personnel to investigate the disaster situation. It previously telegraphed Director Yan Baichuan, requesting him to report the disaster situation in the war zone at any time. Yesterday, the association received a reply telegram from Director Yan, which is excerpted as follows: "To Mr. Kong Yongzhi, Chairman of the Shanghai Joint Relief Association of Charitable Organizations, and all colleagues, I have read your telegram. The bandits and puppets have invaded Suiyuan, and it is our duty to defend the territory. Thanks to the soldiers' efforts, we have achieved a small victory. I am ashamed to have received your praise. I am honored that your association is urging donations of money and goods and plans to send personnel to Suiyuan to relieve the people in the war zone and benefit the disaster victims. In the future, I will report the actual situation in the war zone at any time. Special telegram to express our gratitude, Yan Xishan, with respect."</p>
<h3>Detained Rice Boats Released in Jiading; North Shanghai Resumes Business Yesterday Morning; Rice Prices Remain Stable Due to Active Sales from Various Groups; Representatives Who Petitioned in Jiangsu Province Have Returned to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Representatives of various groups, including Gu Xin'yi, Jiang Zisheng, Lu Jingwen, Jiang Shizhi, and Lu Wenshao, from the City Chamber of Commerce, Local Self-Government Association, Bean and Rice Industry Association, Rice Shop Association, Rice Grain Merchants Association, and Changshu Guild Hall, traveled to Zhenjiang by car at 8 a.m. on the 8th to petition the provincial government. After arriving in the province, the representatives met with Chairman Chen, but due to Chairman Chen's illness, they were not received. The petition delegation then went to the Department of Civil Affairs to meet with Director Yu Jingtang. The secretary, Xiang Jutan, received them. The representatives submitted the official letters from various groups and reported in detail the incident of rice being detained in Jiading County, requesting immediate release to maintain the food supply for Shanghai citizens. The secretary agreed to immediately telegraph the county to release the detained rice boats. However, regarding the lifting of the rice ban, it would be discussed and handled by the Provincial Administrative Conference after receiving a clear order from the Executive Yuan. The representatives achieved satisfactory results and returned to Shanghai on the 6:20 p.m. express train that evening.</p>
<p>Detained Rice Released</p>
<p>After receiving the reply telegram from the Department of Civil Affairs of the Jiangsu Provincial Government on the afternoon of the 8th, the Jiading County Government immediately ordered the Second District Branch of the Nanxiang Public Security Bureau and the Jiading Temple Police Station to release the rice boats. All rice boats began to leave at 5 p.m. the night before last. The water level was low, and there were many boats, so they made every effort to dredge the waterway. The first batch of more than 80 rice boats arrived in Shanghai successively at 6-7 a.m. yesterday. The remaining large number of rice boats stranded in Huangdu and other places also arrived at the North Shanghai wharf successively in the afternoon.</p>
<p>North Shanghai Opens for Business Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Rice shops in the area of Suzhou Creek, north of the Xinzhapu Bridge and Wuzhen Road Bridge in North Shanghai, all opened for business yesterday morning. Rice market transactions were active due to the active sales from various groups. Although river rice poured in, the market price remained stable. It is estimated that from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. yesterday, local rice shops sold a total of more than 2,500 shi of rice, and the number transported to Xi'an was also very large.</p>
<h3>Record of Contemporary Figures' Whereabouts</h3>

It is also reported that Mr. Jiang may go to Shaanxi to meet with Chairman Chiang.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed Request Not to Reduce Import Duties on Guangdong Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance of the Executive Yuan yesterday, stating, "To the Ministry of Finance of the Executive Yuan in Nanjing, This year, all provinces have reported bumper harvests. Hunan, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces are known as provinces that export surplus rice. It is appropriate to balance surpluses and deficits and support each other, so as to benefit the rural areas of Jiangsu and prevent losses. Guangdong Province has always relied on foreign rice for supplementation. During Chen Jitang's administration, he requested the central government to exempt Guangdong Province from import duties on foreign rice, which led to a large influx of foreign rice, resulting in a huge trade deficit in international trade. As a result, the rice markets in Wuhu and Guangdong Province have plummeted, and the national economy and people's livelihood have been affected. People with knowledge lament this. Fortunately, the tariff system has been unified, and Guangdong Province is levying import duties on foreign rice. In today's situation, when smuggling is rampant and customs revenues at Tianjin and Qinhuangdao have plummeted, it is not without benefit to the country and helps domestic rice compete with foreign rice, promoting sales in Guangdong Province, which is in line with the government's policy of regulating food and promoting rural prosperity. From the perspective of Guangdong, since the completion of the Yuehan Railway, it is convenient to transport Hunan rice to Guangdong, and the railway has also reduced freight rates to benefit both sides. Therefore, Guangdong Province is not in danger of lacking rice or eating expensive rice. Shantou also has Wuhu rice from Anhui Province, which is transferred from Jianglun to Shanghai and transported to Shantou, which is equally convenient. Moreover, according to rice merchants, the market price of domestic rice in Guangdong is only around 11 yuan, which is a clear indication that Guangdong rice has not become expensive. Guangdong Province has always taken the overall situation into consideration and will not indulge its habit of eating foreign rice and place the farmers of the whole country in a dilemma. It is a matter of urgency to maintain tariff integrity. Recently, it has been heard that the province has submitted a request to the central government to reduce or exempt import duties on foreign rice. Although it has not yet materialized, rice merchants in Guangdong and Anhui are very shocked, fearing that the agricultural products of the two provinces will have a surplus and repeat the so-called 'ripe famine' of the past. The matter is too important to remain silent. It is appropriate to telegram your esteemed Yuan (Ministry) for review and approval, and to preside over the matter, so that import duties on foreign rice in Guangdong Province will not be reduced or exempted, so as to maintain tariff integrity and save the countryside. We eagerly pray for this. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, respectfully."</p>
<h3>As the End of the Gregorian Calendar Approaches, Both the Banking and Money Industries Are Handling Account Closures</h3>
<p>Xinsheng News reports that the clearinghouses of the money industry close their accounts every year on the Lunar New Year's Eve. Now, the executive committee has decided that this year, the account closure will be handled once at the end of the Gregorian calendar. Members of the Money Industry Association have been notified to comply. The account closure period at the end of this year is approaching, and the money houses have complied with all procedures. Member banks of the Bankers Association handle account closures based on the Gregorian calendar. As the account closure period at the end of the year is approaching, all account closure procedures have been prepared. The association has also scheduled a meeting of member representatives at the end of this month to report on the association's affairs for the past six months and approve the budget and final accounts. This year, agricultural products in various parts of China have been harvested in abundance, resulting in stronger purchasing power among the people. All industries have reported active business, with the cotton textile industry being the most prosperous. Therefore, the account closures at the end of April, the end of October, the Dragon Boat Festival, and the Mid-Autumn Festival, when money houses have long-term credit loans, have all been passed smoothly. As for the account closure at the end of the Gregorian calendar, there is no other concern. It is expected that the account closure period for industry and commerce at the end of the Lunar calendar will also be passed smoothly.</p>

<p>Overview of the Islands: The Shengsi</p>
<p>Islands comprise more than ten large and small islands in the ocean off the borders of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, north of the Zhoushan Archipelago and Chongming Island. Due to jurisdictional issues, Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces had long disputed their governance. At the end of October, the Executive Yuan finally approved that they would remain under the jurisdiction of Jiangsu Province. The fisheries of these islands are extremely prosperous, accounting for over 90% of the islands' total economy, and are the best in the southeastern provinces, with an annual output of nearly 20 million yuan. However, due to frequent incursions by fishing boats from a certain country, the income of the island fishermen is only 3 million yuan. The island's facilities are also very rudimentary, and construction of transportation, water, electricity, and other infrastructure is lacking. After this group's inspection, each group has drafted reports and proposed improvement suggestions, which have been submitted to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for forwarding to the central government for review and approval. It is said that the island's geographical situation is also of great importance to national defense.</p>
<h3>Steamship Industry Association Submits to the Ministry: Flexible Restrictions on Purchasing Old Ships, Our Country's Industry is Immature, Not Suitable to Cut the Feet to Fit the Shoes, Contributes Two Points of Flexible Measures Based on Facts</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Steamship Industry Association has requested the Ministry of Transportation to waive the age limit on ship purchases and has contributed flexible opinions. The original text is as follows: Submitted to address the hindrance to the development of the shipping industry due to restrictions on the age of ship purchases. We respectfully submit a written opinion containing the facts of difficulties collected from shipping merchants and requests for flexible measures. We respectfully request your kind review and approval for implementation. We received a letter from the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau, stating that the Ministry had instructed that in recent years, shipping merchants have often purchased old and dilapidated foreign ships. If not strictly restricted, it would affect navigation safety. In the future, the purchase of old ships should be reported for review, and the age of cargo ships should not exceed twenty years, and the age of passenger ships should not exceed fifteen years. The letter instructed to inform all industry members to comply. Considering the opinions of shipping merchants, the restriction on ship age is indeed inappropriate. We detailed the reasons and requested the Maritime Affairs Bureau to forward it to the Ministry, requesting a delay in implementation. We received a reply that the Ministry instructed that it should not be discussed. While transmitting this, we also received a letter from the Navigation Affairs Department of the Ministry, stating that the three draft plans for consolidating the shipping industry had already accommodated the shipping merchants' requests and had been reviewed and approved. However, Article 17 of the Supervision Regulations, which restricts ship age, will not be changed because it already has a ministerial order. Shipping merchants were disappointed upon hearing this. As this matter is of great importance to the future of the shipping industry, after a joint discussion by all industry members, they believe that restricting the age of ship purchases is not only a personal issue for shipping merchants but also greatly affects the rise and fall of the national shipping industry and the gains and losses of the national economy. Various facts have been collected from each member to prove that the restriction is not timely. Now, we respectfully submit a written opinion containing the facts of difficulties and requests for flexible measures, requesting your kind review and approval for implementation. We are extremely apprehensive and await orders. Respectfully submitted to the Ministry of Transportation.</p>
<p>Attached are the opinions on the facts of difficulties in restricting the age of ship purchases and requests for flexible measures. Opinions on restricting the age of ship purchases: (1) Our country's shipping industry is still in its infancy. Statistics show that the total tonnage of all commercial ships in the country (above 500 tons) is only 447,000 tons, which is less than 1% compared to the total number of ships worldwide (above 500 tons). The United Kingdom and the United States have developed maritime transport and are the leaders in the world, with ship tonnage exceeding 10 million tons. We are far behind them, but countries such as Japan, Germany, Italy, France, and the Netherlands are in the range of 2 to 4 million tons. Even small countries such as Greece and Denmark have more than 1 million tons of commercial ships. With the vast territory, large population, and long coastline of our country, we only have this small amount of tonnage. Upon examination, it is indeed dwarfed in comparison. We should plan to expand and increase tonnage to enhance our international position. Now, by restricting the age of ship purchases, it is like cocooning ourselves, and from then on, our country's shipping industry will inevitably decline, which is contrary to the main purpose of promoting development. (2) Our country has few shipyards, and what they can build is only light-tonnage ships. Although the government has promulgated shipbuilding incentive regulations, even if the order is implemented, the bonuses obtained according to the current shipbuilding prices are less than one-tenth. Therefore, although shipbuilding is encouraged, it is still difficult to achieve practical results. The construction of new ships is unlikely to happen. If the age of ship purchases is restricted abruptly, it will inevitably lead to fewer old ships and no new ships being built, and the shipping industry will be even more diminished. (3) Our country is bound by treaties and cannot prevent foreign merchant ships from sailing. Currently, foreign merchants operating in our country's coastal and Yangtze River shipping (ships above 500 tons): British firm Butterfield &amp; Swire has 65 ships, totaling 162,000 tons; Jardine Matheson has 34 ships, totaling 95,000 tons; Japanese firm Nissin Kisen has 26 ships, totaling 56,000 tons, totaling 313,000 tons. The tonnage of these three companies alone accounts for three-quarters of the number of ships in our country. If we add the British firm Laiji and the Japanese firms Dalian and Osaka, their tonnage will exceed the number of ships in our entire country. Their strength and intense competition are far beyond what our country can match. If we further restrict the purchase of ships by Chinese people, it will only allow foreign merchants to take advantage of the opportunity to develop and increase their power. (4) In the past, when Japan's shipping industry was not developed, shipping merchants competed to purchase old ships from other countries to expand their shipping business, and the government did not restrict them. Recently, the country began to gradually restrict the purchase of old ships because the shipbuilding industry has developed, but Japanese shipping merchants still have more than 40 old ships operating under the flags of other countries to obscure their business. The drawbacks of restrictions can be imagined. Moreover, countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, France, and Norway have old ships accounting for more than one-third or even half of the total number of ships, but there is no order prohibiting the purchase of old ships. Our country's shipping industry is lagging behind, and the situation is even more different. If we do not investigate the actual situation and hastily imitate Japan to restrict old ships, it is equivalent to cutting the feet to fit the shoes, which is not appropriate. (5) The safety of ship navigation should pay attention to the quality of the ship, but more importantly, the prudence of driving, the appropriateness of management, the strictness of inspection, the completeness of equipment, and the perfection of repairs are the most important keys. New ships sailing, even if encountering hurricanes, thick fog, or the other party's ships accidentally steering into the waterway, or due to tidal currents and not knowing the collision avoidance regulations, are not absolutely exempt from the occurrence of danger. As for those who drive old ships, if they can be cautious every step of the way, be familiar with navigation technology, and be able to handle emergencies, it may not necessarily lead to accidents. Moreover, when shipping merchants purchase ships now, they must first examine the ship's detailed list of internal contents and must also pass the examination of Lloyd's or other reliable ship experts to check the iron plates under the waterline and boilers and other procedures. After sailing into the country, when registering with the Maritime Affairs Bureau, technical personnel must measure and conduct special inspections before being allowed to sail. Therefore, the safety issue of old ships is no different from that of new ships. The above points are all based on facts. Once examined, it can be clearly seen that restricting the age of ship purchases is not suitable for today's shipping merchants. It is very clear. Now that the Ministry's order has not been withdrawn and the regulations have not been revised, shipping merchants feel deeply and cannot remain silent. Therefore, we dare to list the facts and make another petition, requesting your consideration and appropriate flexibility to avoid obstruction. There are two flexible measures: (1) Divide the size of the tonnage and make the scope of restrictions. First, implement restrictions on ships below 200 tons, and temporarily waive the implementation for ships above 200 tons. (2) Determine the restriction period according to the increase in tonnage. Currently, the total number of commercial ships in the country is less than 500,000 tons. When it increases to one million tons, implement the restriction. When it increases to more than 750,000 tons but less than one million tons, the age limit should be increased by ten years according to the current ministerial order. This flexible handling can be consistent with the Ministry's order, and the difficulties of the shipping industry can also be taken care of.</p>

<p>Yang Wendao and Ye Haisheng, both from Guangdong, were accused of assassinating Japanese sailor Nakayama Hideo in Hongkou last winter. After the police investigation identified them as the perpetrators, they were prosecuted. The First Special District Court initially sentenced them to death. Yang and Ye were dissatisfied and, through their defense lawyers, filed an appeal with the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. Presiding Judge Yu convened a collegiate panel on the 2nd of this month, ordering Yang and Ye to present their case. After a full day of investigation and deliberation, the debate was declared closed, and the public pronouncement was scheduled for the afternoon of the 9th. Yang and Ye were returned to the Western Prison by the police. Yesterday at 2 PM, the time for the verdict arrived.

Yang and Ye both expressed their dissatisfaction and stated they would file an appeal.</p>
<h3>The City Was as Dark as Night: Heavy Fog Yesterday Morning Affected Air and Sea Traffic; Shops Had to Operate with Lights On</h3>
<p>After the atmosphere in this city turned cold, there have already been two instances of fog. Although it drifted and dissipated intermittently, the weather has turned cold. Yesterday morning, heavy fog returned, thick and condensed, making it impossible to see even at close range. Traffic was greatly affected. The Associated Press reporter has recorded the following details:</p>
<p>Dense Fog</p>
<p>The day before yesterday afternoon, there was a brief period of sleet. The weather was gloomy all day. Yesterday at dawn, heavy fog suddenly arose, thick and impenetrable. It was difficult to distinguish people and objects even at close range. All kinds of vehicles on the streets drove with their lights on, and businesses had to operate with their electric lights on. The city was dark, resembling a night scene. After 9 AM, heavy rain resumed, making the fog even denser.</p>
<p>Waterway Closure</p>
<p>Imports and exports, ships, were all suspended until 11:00 AM this morning due to the heavy fog. Ships held up outside the Wusongkou included the Xin Beijing on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, the Long'an on the Shanghai-Guangdong route, the Wuxue on the Yangtze River route, and the Shengjing on the Northern Seas route. Vessels held up in the Huangpu River included about five or six ships such as the Huangpu on the Yangtze River route and the Haiheng on the Shanghai-Guangdong route.</p>
<p>Delayed Flights</p>
<p>At the same time, the waters of the Huangpu River were mixed with fog, creating a very dense atmosphere. Apart from the Bopu ferry, which was still slowly moving with its lights on, all other boats were suspended. The Shanghai-Hankou-Westbound flights of the China National Aviation Corporation, as well as the Shanghai-Ping-Northbound flights, were also delayed. Traffic only resumed gradually after the fog dissipated in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Construction of Guide Dikes at the Mouth of the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>A reporter from Zhongzhou News Agency learned from the Huangpu River Dredging Bureau yesterday that the guide dikes built by the bureau at the mouth of the Huangpu River have now been fully completed. Construction of this guide dike began in 1907 on the left bank of the river, with the dike shaped in a semi-circle. The purpose of this dike is to limit the cross-current of the tide to one side. At the same time, the depth of the water in the Huangpu River can be increased from seventeen feet to twenty-five feet. The entire project cost 1 million yuan. Ocean-going vessels with heavier tonnage can also smoothly enter the port without having to anchor outside the Wusongkou. Eight years later, Chederan, the chief engineer of the Huangpu River Dredging Bureau, proposed building a similar guide dike on the side of the Huangpu River. However, this dike is simpler than the previous one, and the materials used are mainly willow wood and small stones, with a length of one English mile. Now that this dike has been completed, the depth of the Huangpu River can be increased by several more feet. Ships can come and go without being affected by high or low tides. In the future, the bureau plans to extend the dike towards the Longhua River surface.</p>
<h3>A Tourist Angrily Took Poison After Being Slapped by a Dancer</h3>
<p>Shi Lianbao, a 25-year-old from Fenghua, residing at No. 63 Yongji Lane, Datong Road, went to the Juelu Dance Hall on Yu Qiaqing Road to dance the night before last. He had a quarrel with dancer Chen Lili and was slapped in the face by the dancer. Shi left quickly. At 6:30 last night, Shi swallowed sleeping pills and staggered back to the Juelu Dance Hall to reason with Chen. Unexpectedly, the poison took effect suddenly, and he collapsed. The dance hall staff, realizing he had taken poison, reported to the police and sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment by ambulance.</p>
<h3>Lawyer Ji ZongSui Is Accused of Public Insult Due to Defending a Litigant. Lawyer Ji Denies Any Intention to Insult.</h3>
<p>Lawyer Ji ZongSui joined the Shanghai Lawyers Association as a member in August of the 19th year of the Republic [1930], and set up his office on the 5th floor of the Continental Commercial Building on Nanjing Road. Recently, Sun Jisheng, the owner of Ruichang Clothing Store at 1243 Huade Road, filed a criminal suit against Lawyer Ji with the First Special Court, accusing him of violating Article 309 of the Criminal Code for publicly insulting him. The main points of the indictment were as follows: The plaintiff and the defendant, Ji ZongSui, did not know each other. At 11:00 AM on the 26th of last month,</p>
<p>First Special Court</p>
<p>Criminal Court One Judge Feng Shide was hearing the case of Zhang Linqing and Zhang Sun vs. Hou Guangren et al. for assault. When Hou Guangren's defense lawyer, Ji ZongSui, made his statement, he publicly declared that "Hou Guangren has a daughter, Hou Xiuqin, who broke away from the Weng family and received 8,000 yuan for living expenses, and was then seduced by Sun Jisheng, Zhang Linqing's nephew, who coveted Hou's wealth and beauty," etc. Miu Baosheng and others who were in the audience at the time heard this. This clearly constitutes</p>
<p>The crime of public insult." Upon receiving the complaint, the court, led by Judge Dai, convened a hearing in Criminal Court Two yesterday afternoon. The plaintiff, Sun Jisheng, recounted the previous events, stating that the defendant's insulting remarks in court were heard by my legal counsel, Lawyer Shi Jiutang, who then relayed them to me, hence the lawsuit. When questioned, the defendant Ji ZongSui argued that I appeared in court in another case as a defender, and during the debate, I mentioned Sun Jusheng. However, the suit was brought against Sun Jisheng. Not only are the characters "Ju" and "Ji"</p>
<p>Different in meaning, their pronunciations are also different. The plaintiff in the lawsuit, therefore, is inaccurate. Furthermore, I was at the time clarifying and explaining matters directly related to the dispute based on the statements of both parties, doing my best to defend and attack, which is an obligation that a defense lawyer should fulfill. There is absolutely no question of criminal intent. If a defense lawyer is convicted for this, then in the future, defense lawyers, when appearing in court, can only</p>
<p>Pretend to be mutes. Moreover, I do not know the plaintiff and had no intention of insulting him. Since the plaintiff was not present when the other case was heard, it is impossible for my remarks to cause him discomfort based on Lawyer Shi's recounting, and thus it does not meet the requirements for insult. In terms of substance, not only did the defendant in the other case confess that Hou Xiuqin was</p>
<p>Seduced and eloped with Jisheng, but also the plaintiff's agent, Lawyer Shi, admitted in court in the other case that Hou Xiu had an affair with Zhang Linqing's store partner. These points can all be verified by the trial transcript. I request that I be declared innocent." The court announced the debate closed and set the verdict for the 14th of this month.</p>
<h3>Mr. Jiang Zuling, Manager of Hua Hua Pen Factory, Steals Gold Pen Nibs to Exchange for Money, Totaling 290 Dozen Worth Over 3,000 Yuan, Takes Them to a Silver Shop to Melt Down, Obtaining Over 1,000 Yuan in Gold, Jiang, Burdened with Debt After Marriage, Conceived a Wild Idea</h3>
<p>Jiang Zuling, a native of Ningbo, residing at No. 57 Dexing Lane, Disicheng Road, was appointed as the manager of the Hua Hua Fountain Pen Factory at No. 39 Bowuyuan Road in the spring of this year. The factory was established by Xu Deren, a Ningbo merchant dealing in tobacco, who was a close friend of Jiang. Therefore, when Jiang was appointed as the manager, he also invested 300 yuan of capital. Jiang has been in charge for seven months, and the factory's business has been quite prosperous. However, Jiang is over thirty years old and has not yet married. Through matchmaking, he married a Miss Ge on the 16th of last month. However, Jiang had no permanent assets, and the marriage resulted in heavy debts. Recently, due to creditors' demands for repayment, Jiang was unable to pay. Out of desperation, on the afternoon of the 2nd of this month at 1:00 PM, he took 290 dozen fountain pen nibs (each nib containing 60% gold content), valued at 3,200 yuan, from the factory to the Lao Tianbao Silver Shop on Nanyang Bridge in the French Concession and exchanged them for 1,202 yuan and 7 jiao and 1 fen in national currency. After obtaining the money, Jiang did not go to the factory to work. After Xu learned of this, he reported it to the General Inspectorate. Detectives Song Yuanshan and Bao Tan Ni Jiaxin were instructed to investigate. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, they finally found Jiang, his wife Jiang Ge, and his mother-in-law Ge Lin hiding in Room 106 of the Tongshang Hotel on Avenue Edward VII. They rushed to arrest them and brought them back to the police station. They found 30 silver dollars on Jiang, 55 yuan on Jiang Ge, and 1,000 yuan in Ge Lin's pocket. An investigation at Lao Tianbao revealed that the gold had already been melted down. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special District Court. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi prosecuted them under Articles 30 and 336 of the Criminal Law. Subsequently, Jiang Deren reported that there were still fountain pens and accounts, and it was not yet clear whether there was any further embezzlement. When questioned, Jiang Zuling confessed that he committed the crime due to marriage debts. He claimed that his mother-in-law was unaware of the matter and wept incessantly. After Judge Qian Hongye of the Criminal Division questioned Jiang Ge and Ge Lin, he ordered the case to be adjourned for further questioning. Jiang Ge and Ge Lin were released and ordered to appear in court for the next hearing.</p>
<h3>Fuyuan Theater: A Visitor Fires a Gun While Meeting a Friend, Wu Linlin Arrested and Taken to the Police Station</h3>
<p>Xu Shunqing, a 50-year-old native of Pudong, established the Fuyuan Theater on Avenue Joffre in Shanghai. Yesterday afternoon at 2:50 PM, while a play was being performed, Wu Linlin, a 46-year-old native of Nantong, residing at No. 10 Puan Lane, Minquan Road, French Concession, went to the theater to look for actor Wang Guoxiang. Zhang Hualin, a 29-year-old Shandong native who was collecting tickets at the theater, stopped him from entering, and the two got into an argument. The argument escalated into a fight. Wu Linlin took out a pistol from his pocket and fired two shots. At the time, there were over two hundred theatergoers inside the theater. Upon hearing the shots, they suspected it was a robbery and fled in different directions, causing chaos. Wu ran out of the theater after firing the shots. Police officers arrived and apprehended Wu Linlin, confiscating a Browning pistol containing six bullets. He was taken to the Caojiadu Public Security Bureau for questioning and will be transferred to the General Bureau for handling.</p>
<h3>Chief of Gaoqiao Public Security Bureau Accused of Embezzling Bonuses, Trial Concluded Yesterday, Sentence to be Announced on a Scheduled Date</h3>
<p>Wang Songfu, Xing Sigui, and others, former police officers at the Gaoqiao Branch of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau in Pudong, filed a private lawsuit in the local court against Guo Bin, an eighteen-year-old patrol officer, and Tang Jinghuan, a forty-five-year-old chief of the branch bureau, accusing them of embezzling 270 yuan, 0 jiao, 1 fen, and 6 li of bonus money. The case was heard by Judge Xie Zhengong yesterday. The plaintiffs stated that on March 27, they discovered smuggled rayon on the Yuxing steamer of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. They were awarded 436 yuan and 9 jiao and 6 fen by their superiors, but Tang and Guo embezzled it. They claimed that they had only received 166 yuan and 8 jiao approved by the General Bureau and requested the recovery of 270 yuan, 0 jiao, 1 fen, and 6 li. They also claimed that on September 4, he gave me fifty yuan, but I do not know for what reason. I didn't hand it in to the treasury and transferred me to the General Bureau etc. The judge stated that regarding the private lawsuit, according to customs regulations, it should be transferred to the civil court and cannot be attached to the criminal lawsuit. The plaintiffs agreed to transfer the civil lawsuit to the civil court. The judge then questioned Tang Jinghuan, who stated that after discovering the smuggled goods in March, according to the usual bonus distribution, the branch chief should receive 50%, the superior officer should receive 25%, and the officers who solved the case should receive 25%. However, since it was the initial resolution of the case, the General Bureau was reported and they got 40% each, they all got it. Later, because they had a fight, they were transferred to the General Bureau and have now been fired, so they hold a grudge and falsely accuse me and requested dismissal and filed a counterclaim. Guo Bin also stated that he led the search for the smuggled goods. His statement was similar to Tang's. The judge concluded the debate and scheduled the sentence to be announced at 10:00 AM on the 14th of this month.</p>
<h3>Tianfaxiang Fur Store: Female Swindler Apprehended, Grey Overcoat Not Lost, Female Swindler Thrown in Jail</h3>
<p>At around 11:00 AM, as the Tianfaxiang Fur Store at No. 390 Henan Road was preparing to close, a modernly dressed female customer arrived. The store clerks greeted her and asked what she wanted to buy. She identified herself as Deng Chengli, a 27-year-old native of Henan, and said she wanted a grey overcoat. She selected one priced at 88 yuan, put it on, and asked the store clerks to accompany her home to get the money. She hired a Xiang Sheng taxi, and Tianfaxiang sent store clerks Zhu Chunmao and Hong Futang to go with her. The taxi drove to the intersection of North Henan Road and Laobazi Road and stopped. They entered the Yanqing Lane and went to No. 7 Kangheng Printing House. Deng asked the two clerks to wait outside while she went inside to get the money from her husband. However, Zhu and Hong, knowing that there were many scams recently, suspected foul play and refused her request. Deng had no choice but to return to the store with the two clerks. Suspecting that Deng's actions were suspicious, they called the police (No. 468) and had Deng Chengli arrested and taken to the General Inspectorate. Under questioning, she firmly denied any intention to swindle and refused to reveal her address. After two hours of questioning, she finally admitted that she lived at No. 54 Yongan Lane, North Sichuan Road. Police officers were sent to search her residence and found nine pawn tickets. Deng was transferred to the women's prison for detention. Yesterday morning, she was escorted to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu prosecuted her for attempted fraud under Article 339, Section 3 of the Criminal Law, and stated that the police found nine pawn tickets in the defendant's residence, suggesting other possible offenses. It was also discovered that the defendant had previously been fined ten yuan for soliciting male customers. He requested an adjournment. The defendant Deng Chengli denied the charges, claiming that she was being framed by the Tianfaxiang Fur Store. Judge Pan ordered the defendant to be detained and remanded for further questioning in seven days.</p>
<h3>Robbery Case on Zhoujiazui Road: Deceased Thief Identified, Autopsy Approved</h3>
<p>On the afternoon of the day before yesterday at 7:00 PM, the Xietai Grain Store at No. 157 Zhoujiazui Road was broken into by four robbers who brandished guns and demanded silence. They stole 70 yuan in legal tender and silver coins before fleeing. The owner, Gu Shuitao, a native of Pudong, reported the incident to the Jiaxing Road Police Station by telephone. Detectives Cao Jinbiao and Liu Zhongcheng, along with nearby patrol officers, were dispatched to apprehend the robbers. The robbers resisted arrest. As a result, one of the robbers, Wang Xiaosan from Nanjing, was captured, and another robber was shot and wounded and sent to the police hospital for treatment. He died from his injuries. The body was sent to the Ferry Road Morgue. Wang was taken to the police station for detention. Details of the case have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. A passerby, Zhou Keming, was injured and is being treated at Tongren Hospital. The defendant stated in his police confession that he had recently arrived in Shanghai from his hometown and stayed with friends Luo Fuyuan and Zhu Lanting at No. 18 Yucai Lane in Zhabei. Unable to find work, Luo and Zhu invited him to rob Xietai. He stood guard outside. The police sent Chinese and foreign detectives to Zhabei, together with detectives from the Public Security Bureau, to arrest the accomplices who had fled elsewhere. They only found a bundle of stolen banknotes totaling 18 yuan and 6 jiao. Because the banknotes were tied with rubber bands, they could be identified and asked for an extension. Gu Shuitao, the owner, and apprentices Xi Maogou and Li Jinshun from the store, testified to the events. The detectives found two fake ironwood pistols at the scene and kept them for inspection. When questioned, Wang’s testimony was evasive. Judge Xiao Xiefen ordered him to be detained for further investigation. The body of the deceased Liu was inspected by prosecutor Song from the court, who determined that the unidentified robber had died from gunshot wounds sustained before death. An autopsy was approved by the forensic research institute, and the body was handed over to Ah Shan Villa for burial.</p>

<h3>Dancer Zhu Menglan Accuses of Attempted Rape and Assault, Defendant is Du Baosheng, Owner of Royal Dance Hall, Court Questioned Plaintiff Yesterday</h3>
<p>Zhu Menglan, a Guangdong woman also known as Zhu Meilan, 21 years old, residing at No. 170 Meidexing Lane, No. 176 Peng Road, who worked as a dancer at the Yangtze Dance Hall and other places, recently filed a criminal complaint with the First Special District Court through lawyer Yan Enliang, accusing Du Baosheng, the owner of the Royal Dance Hall at No. 65 Chang'an Lane, Wusong Road, and his wife, of attempted rape and assault, causing injuries. She requested that they be punished according to Article 277 of the Criminal Law. Because Zhu only wrote "Boss Du" in the complaint when she went to the court for an injury examination, the court summoned Zhu Menglan to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court yesterday afternoon for investigation to clarify the matter. Questioned by Judge Dai Rongduo, Zhu Menglan stated that because of poverty, she learned to dance. In November of this year, she was introduced to the Royal Dance Hall on Zhubaoshan Road to work as a dancer. The owner, Du Baosheng, coveted her beauty and forced her to engage in improper behavior. Because she refused, he held a grudge. On the morning of the 26th of last month at 11:00 AM, he incited another dancer to lure her to the defendant's residence and falsely accused her of defaming his reputation. He and his wife severely beat her, causing injuries to her abdomen and legs. She reported the incident to the Hongkou Police Station. She was treated by Dr. Gong Yan and went to the court for an injury examination. Lawyer Yan Enliang stated that it has been determined that the defendant "Boss Du's" real name is Baosheng, so another complaint has been filed with the court to request that the case be heard and investigated. After verifying the testimony, Judge Dai ordered the case to be adjourned to the afternoon of the 16th to summon the defendants Du Baosheng and his wife for further questioning.</p>

<h3>Warning: Beware of Being Deceived When Purchasing Fire Extinguishers</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Municipal Council, there are now unscrupulous merchants in the concession who wear uniforms similar to those worn by personnel of the Public Concession Fire Department. They break into small factories run by Chinese and inspect under false pretenses. They sell fire extinguishers and use alarming language, as if they were acting under orders and purchase is unavoidable. Merchants lacking knowledge are often deceived and buy cheap fire extinguishers and other equipment at exorbitant prices.

<h3>Gong Xikui Sued for Alimony by Divorced Wife, Owed Over 1,000 Yuan in Alimony, Gong Has Left Shanghai and Cannot Be Served</h3>
<p>Gong Xikui, former magistrate of Suining County, inspector-general of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, and chief of the Xinzha branch of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, married Li Manying (now 27 years old, residing at No. 112 Qingtai Road, Hangzhou), a woman from Hang County, in Hangzhou seven years ago. They married and lived together in Hangzhou, but did not have any children. Recently, Gong has taken a new lover and built a golden house at No. 7 Chongde Lane, Luban Road, French Concession, ignoring Li. This caused a breakdown in their relationship. The two divorced by agreement in Shanghai on January 15 of this year. An agreement was signed, certified by a lawyer, stipulating that Gong would pay Li 5,000 yuan in alimony in installments. The agreement stated that 500 yuan would be paid within one week of the signing date, 200 yuan would be paid at the end of February, 300 yuan would be paid in March and April, and 120 yuan would be paid every month starting at the end of May until the full amount of 5,000 yuan was paid. However, after signing the divorce agreement, Gong only paid the first installment of 500 yuan. No further payments have been made, and as of the end of November, he owes 1,520 yuan, which he has ignored. Unable to make a living, Li hired a lawyer to send a letter urging Gong to pay, but to no effect. Li Manying has hired lawyer Yuan Yang'an to file a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the Second Special Court against Gong, requesting that the court order the defendant to pay the overdue amount of 1,520 yuan. The court accepted the complaint and, in early December, Judge Wu Xiaoke convened a hearing in the Civil Division. The process server tried to serve Gong Xikui, the defendant, at his residence but was unable to do so as he was not in Shanghai, and nobody accepted the summons. Only the plaintiff, represented by lawyer Yuan, stated the facts of the lawsuit and requested a judgment on the subject matter, interest, and legal costs to be borne by the defendant, that the defendant's whereabouts are unknown and impossible to subpoena, and requested a public notice. The court reviewed the circumstances and adjourned the hearing to subpoena the defendant for further examination.</p>

<h3>Yang Emerald Store on Liangting Road, City, Child Burned to Death, Fire Breaks Ladder, Child Thrown from Window Upstairs, Pregnant Housewife and Partner Jump Out of Window Injured, Spreads to Neighbors, Bird Store and Small World</h3>
<p>At 7:45 yesterday morning, a fire broke out on the upper floor of the Wang Baofeng Yang Emerald Store at No. 16 Liangting Road, west of Fuyou Road, Xinbeimen, Nanshi, due to cooking breakfast and using a gas stove. Although the fire departments of the nearby Chenghuangmiao and Nanshi districts dispatched vehicles to rescue the situation, the streets there were narrow, and the shops were crowded, making rescue difficult. The fire spread for three hours, destroying as many as eighteen neighboring buildings. A portion of the Xiaoshijie Amusement Park was also affected. Details are described below:</p>
<p>Gas Stove Fire</p>
<p>The Wang Baofeng Yang Emerald Jewelry and Toy Store at No. 16 Liangting Road, Nanshi, is opened by Wang Yuquan (35 years old) from Zhenjiang. The business has been booming. At around 7:45 yesterday morning, a fire suddenly broke out in the upstairs of the store, due to cooking breakfast. Because all the goods and raw materials in the store were flammable, the fire quickly spread.</p>
<p>Fire Departments Arrive</p>
<p>The nearby police reported to the fire department, and the fire was already out of control. The Chenghuangmiao fire department arrived first. Seeing that the fire was getting fiercer and spreading, almost all the fire departments in Nanshi dispatched to assist in the rescue. The fire was slightly weaker at 10 o'clock. The Chenghuangmiao and Laobeidou police stations dispatched a large number of police officers to maintain order.</p>
<p>Child Thrown, Burned to Death</p>
<p>When the fire first broke out, Wang Yuquan and his wife Wang woke up from their sleep. The ladder had been burned off. In a hurry, Wang first threw his five-year-old son Da Shuangzi from the upstairs window. He and his wife and partner Zhu Yongsheng (23 years old from Zhenjiang) jumped out of the window. All three were seriously injured and sent to Nanyang Hospital. The most tragic thing was that when Wang threw Da Shuangzi down, he landed behind the horizontal sign on the door and was burned to death. Yao is seven months pregnant and her life is in danger. In addition, Wang's relative Yao Meixiao was also slightly injured and discharged from the hospital after being bandaged.</p>

<h3>The Croclot Case: French Consulate Opened Trial Yesterday</h3>
<p>French author Croclot, 50 years old, was arrested in Peiping two months ago for a fake passport and brought to Shanghai. He went on a hunger strike for several days. Yesterday morning, the French Consulate opened a trial in court, presided over by Judge Kaufman. The plaintiff was the French Police, and the defendant hired a lawyer for defense. After the court opened, five witnesses were summoned. The fake passport had fire marks around it. The defendant said that he had placed a cigarette butt in the drawer, and when he discovered it, it had burned the passport. He knew that carrying a fake passport was a serious crime, so he wanted to burn it, but stopped temporarily because he wanted to find out who had framed him by putting the passport in his luggage. His testimony was the same as what he said before he was imprisoned, but the judge did not believe what the defendant said and repeatedly asked him to tell the truth.</p>
<h3>Workers of China Match Factory Petition to Party and Government Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency, since the China Match Factory in Pingjiang Bridge, Zhabei, stopped work without reason in the middle of last month, the 400 workers, unable to make a living, negotiated with the factory, requesting a subsidy for food expenses during the shutdown, but the factory refused. Therefore, the workers petitioned to the Municipal Party Department, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the General Labor Union, requesting mediation, and submitted thirteen conditions in accordance with the Factory Law. The Social Affairs Bureau sent personnel to investigate and convened both parties for mediation. The Social Affairs Bureau believed that the conditions proposed by the workers were all legitimate and ordered the factory to accept them. However, the factory insisted on its attitude, and the mediation failed. It has been three weeks, and the workers' livelihood is almost on the verge of collapse. The factory has not made any indication. All the workers elected representatives and petitioned the Municipal Party Department, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the General Labor Union at 10:00 AM yesterday, requesting a prompt solution to ensure the workers' livelihood and avoid accidents. The party and government agencies and the General Labor Union have sent personnel to mediate after receiving the petition.</p>

<h3>International Art Theatre Society to Perform the Opera "Dodder Dreams"</h3>
<p>According to a report from the National News Agency's Shanghai office on the 9th, the International Art Theatre Society of Shanghai, organized by Chinese and foreign stage artists, with support from Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke and his wife, Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng and his wife, Academia Sinica President Cai Yuanpei, and Central Supervisory Committee member Chu Minyi and his wife, will stage the opera "Dodder Dreams," the latest masterpiece by renowned composer Afu Xiaoloomov, at the Grand Shanghai Theatre on the 15th of this month at 7:15 p.m. Tickets are priced at four, three, and one yuan, and all proceeds will be donated to a relief fund for unemployed musicians and playwrights in Shanghai. The entire opera is divided into three acts, with elegant music, bizarre plot, and specially made costumes and sets. The entire performance is meticulously guided by experts in Chinese opera, and all movements are sufficient to express the meaning of the music and match the rhythm of the music. Rehearsals are now complete. It is expected that the performance of this opera will shine uniquely in the drama world. Composer Afu has lived in China for more than ten years, and has been dedicated to studying Chinese music and drama, keenly observing its strengths and weaknesses. He then proceeded to thoroughly explore ways to improve and develop it. Afu often said that China has extremely rich melodies, such as folk songs, etc., but unfortunately, they are only the rudiments of musical pieces, and the inner details are complex, with flaws and merits interspersed. If composers can remove the dross and select the essence, and use Western composition methods to compose large pieces, then Chinese music can stand out in the world music scene and compete with advanced European music countries. However, Western harmony, counterpoint, and musical forms are not all applicable to Chinese music. Musicians must conduct long-term research and experimentation on both Chinese and Western music to understand the way to choose what to follow and what to discard. Empty talk on paper is unrealistic, and trying to fit square pegs into round holes is also counterproductive. Afu believes that the reform of Chinese drama should start with music because music is the foundation of opera. The difficulty in developing Chinese drama is due to the lack of music suitable for the plot and movements. Therefore, reformers of drama who only focus on improving the scenery and scripts and ignore music, their reform, which abandons the root and pursues the branches, may instead lead the development of drama itself astray, and the result will be a hybrid (neither opera nor spoken drama) drama. Now, most playwrights in China do not understand Western music, and musicians are ignorant of drama. Therefore, to reform drama, both parties must cooperate and first solve the fundamental problem. The remaining minor issues will not be difficult to resolve. Afu's ideal is like this. He has composed more than ten kinds of symphonies, sonatas, preludes, and operas based on his years of research, which have been performed in Shanghai and Europe and the United States, and have attracted the attention of the music and drama circles and have received good reviews from art authorities. This performance of the opera "Dodder Dreams" will not only be welcomed by those who love music and art, but also be regarded as a valuable research material by those engaged in the movement to reform Chinese opera.</p>
<p>Playwright: Afu Xiaoloomov; Performers: Mr. and Mrs. Tang Shixuan</p>

<h3>All Chinese Employees of the National Customs Repeatedly Donate Large Sums to Support Suiyuan, Reaching 30,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Since the bandits invaded Suiyuan, all Chinese employees of the National Customs, considering that the National Army was guarding the territory and fighting bloody battles, and their hard work and great achievements, took the lead in voluntarily donating one million yuan of their salaries and directly telegraphed it to Suiyuan, requesting Chairman Fu to forward it to the front lines to comfort them. Later, after the National Army recovered Bailingmiao, the employees continued to remit one million yuan for the purpose of rewarding the soldiers. These were briefly recorded in various newspapers. Recently, the Customs Club in Tongyi Lane, Jing'an Temple Road, Shanghai, learned that the employees had previously remitted 20,000 yuan and received a thank you letter and telegram from Chairman Fu. The original letter stated, "To all Chinese employees of the National Customs, We have received your remittance of 10,000 yuan, which fully expresses your patriotic enthusiasm to encourage morale. We accept it with reverence. It is our duty to promote benevolence and vigorously encourage our troops, hoping that the three armies will be energized and devote themselves to the battlefield. Based on this sincerity, we will answer the generous gift of our patriotic compatriots. In addition to informing all units at the front, we have specially drawn up a receipt, which is sent with the letter for your perusal. As for the detailed distribution method in the future, we will declare the purpose after it is finalized, so as to show great faith. This is to express our gratitude. Sincerely wish you well. Attached is a receipt. Fu Zuoyi respectfully." The original telegram said, "To the Shanghai Customs Club, Your telegram has been received and read. We are grateful for your previous concern and donation to comfort the troops. In addition to our gratitude, we should immediately send a telegram to thank you. We believe that it has been perused. Now we are grateful for your generous donation of salaries, which is even more inspiring. We can only encourage the soldiers to devote themselves to the battlefield and live up to expectations. Fu Zuoyi bowed." At the same time, the employees, considering that the soldiers at the front continued to fight bitterly against the bandits and puppets in the icy and snowy weather and repeatedly took key passes, in order to show their continuous support, again yesterday (8th) remitted 10,000 yuan in comfort money to Suiyuan through the Bank of China. The original telegram is as follows, "To Chairman Fu of Suiyuan, We have previously remitted a total of 20,000 yuan in comfort money. We trust that you have received it. Since the outbreak of the war, you have worked hard to defend the border and promote national prestige, and the soldiers at the front have loyally devoted themselves to the icy and snowy battlefield, fighting bloody battles and repeatedly defeating the bandits. Looking north to the frontier clouds, we are filled with admiration and comfort. We now donate another 10,000 yuan of our salaries, which will still be remitted through the Bank of China. Please forward it to the front lines to show our support and comfort, and please reply by telegram. All Chinese employees of the National Customs bowed. G, Shanghai Customs Club issued." According to reports, the employees are extremely concerned about the suppression of bandits in Suiyuan, and they have donated a large sum of 10,000 yuan in comfort money in one stroke. Their patriotic enthusiasm is indeed commendable.</p>

<h3>French Concession Detective Jin Jiulin Retires</h3>
<p>Jin Jiulin, the inspector of the special agency of the French Concession Police Department, has been in office for 27 years, repeatedly solving major cases with outstanding achievements, and has always had good relationships with all parties. Now, due to old age and physical weakness, the burden is heavy and difficult to bear, so he submitted his resignation to the French Police Superintendent. The Superintendent, Faber (translated), believing that Jin is prudent in handling affairs on a daily basis, relied heavily on him and immediately tried to retain him. However, Jin resolutely requested to resign due to old age and illness, and the Superintendent approved his resignation, allowing him to resign. However, he has been granted temporary leave in the recent period and will officially resign from January 1, 1927.</p>
<h3>Wuben Principal Sued by Teachers for Breach of Contract, Demanding Compensation for Salaries Due</h3>
<p>Hu Lan (female), the principal of the Shanghai Municipal Wuben Girls' Middle School, was recently sued in court by female teachers Peng Junshi (from Jiangsu), Wan Rong (from Hubei), De Jingwa (from Liaoning), and Yan Qingxin (from Hebei), who hired lawyer Zhang Shanle, on charges of breaching the contract. Judge Pang opened the court yesterday to hear the case. The plaintiffs stated that they were hired by the defendant as teachers of the school, and submitted a request to the Municipal Education Bureau for approval and signed a contract. In the autumn of this year, the defendant suddenly stopped our work. When we asked for the reason, the defendant remained silent. In addition to reporting the defendant's abuse of private power and breach of contract to the Municipal Education Bureau, we have filed a complaint requesting compensation for the salaries due according to the law. The defendant, Hu Lan, did not appear, but was represented by the school secretary, Mr. Hu. He replied that the contract mentioned by the plaintiffs was approved by the Municipal Education Bureau, and they requested compensation, etc. However, the current teachers of the school were also approved by the Municipal Education Bureau. There was no abuse of power or suspension of their work, so they were unwilling to compensate. The judge, noting that both parties held different views, considered that mediation was unsuccessful and ordered the plaintiffs to formally file a lawsuit, and then adjourned the court.</p>

<h3>New Year's Cards and Invitation Cards Must Be Mailed Separately</h3>
<p>According to Shanghai postal authorities, as the end of the year approaches, the number of New Year's cards and other postal items received by the post office will inevitably become crowded. If senders can bundle the three types of items separately (those sent to the local area, domestic, and overseas) and then mail them, the delivery will definitely be faster. Also, if invitation cards are to be mailed, it is best to bundle them separately and not mix them with New Year's cards to avoid delays.</p>

<h3>The Original Driving Force for Enhancing Marital Love</h3>
<p>Sexual life is the only indispensable way to enhance love and eliminate barriers. Such happiness can only be enjoyed by the strong and healthy; the weak should seek treatment immediately.</p>
<p>Marital life brings together a man and a woman who have grown up in different environments and live the closest of lives. Spending all day together can certainly increase affection, but it can also lead to a lot of conflict due to differences in personality. If the force of growing affection is greater than the force of personality conflict, the love between the couple will grow day by day; otherwise, they will often quarrel and become a pair of resentful partners. In this way, to enhance the affection between husband and wife and maintain harmony, the only way is to find ways to eliminate conflict invisibly and increase the forces that promote things.</p>
<p>How can we make the force of growing affection greater than the force of personality conflict? This requires strengthening the original driving force of love. The original driving force of love is actually sexual life. The basis of the union of men and women is the mutual need for sex; when sexual desire can be satisfied, love is often stimulated in new ways, not only does it not weaken, but it can gradually increase.</p>
<p>In the enjoyment of sex, all the masks of the human world are discarded, and both parties are intoxicated and feel that the spirits and bodies of the two have become one, understanding all the differences in personality between them, and conflict cannot occur. Marital life is full of happiness.</p>
<p>However, this kind of happiness can only be enjoyed by strong and healthy men and women. Those with weak sexual function are not blessed to enjoy it. It is often seen that young men are either congenitally deficient or indulged in masturbation when they were young, damaging their reproductive glands and causing spermatorrhea, kidney deficiency, and other symptoms. They are unable to satisfy their wives' desires.</p>
<p>There are also similar unfortunate women who, due to weakness or masturbation, have weak sexual sensitivity, irregular menstruation, and lack pleasure in sexual activity, unable to be aroused at the same time as their husbands' passion.</p>
<p>Over time, love has no original driving force to promote it, and there is no hope of increasing it; it may even lead to hatred. If no remedy is sought, it will inevitably lead to a breakdown.</p>
<p>Male patients should urgently take "Himidol's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" to consolidate the sperm gate and avoid spermatorrhea. Then take the gonadal hormone preparation "Gonadin" to strengthen the reproductive glands, restore developmental function, and allow the sexual organs to develop and grow. Female patients have the female gonadal hormone preparation "Female Gonadin," which can regulate menstruation, restore sexual sensitivity, and enable appropriate sexual life.</p>
<p>After such treatment, the sexual function is healthy and powerful; the whole body is strengthened, and it can also be used as a tonic in the winter season, which will surely achieve two goals with one effort.</p>

<p>Therapeutic Guidance</p>
<h3>The Guiding Light for Gonorrhea Patients</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yao Chongpei, Medical Doctor of the University of Pennsylvania, USA</p>
<p>People suffering from gonorrhea are at risk of lifelong harm if they are not careful. Although acute gonorrhea is more painful, it is easier to treat; if the bacteria are not completely killed and it develops into chronic gonorrhea, the pain is very mild, but if it is not cured for a long time and infects your wife and children, you will suffer enough. Furthermore, if the disease is deeply rooted, the gonococci will penetrate deep into the body, and various complications will erupt one after another. For example, orchitis causes the testicles to swell and become painful, and if it is not treated for a long time, the reproductive function will also disappear. Another example is arthritis, which makes the hands and feet inflexible and may lead to disability. Another example is leucorrhea in women, which damages the body over time and hinders fertility. If gonococci are accidentally infected into the eyes, there is a risk of blindness. There are many other types of complications. In short, there is a risk of patients taking one wrong step that will lead to eternal regret.</p>
<p>To avoid this danger, when starting treatment, you must be careful in choosing medicine. The most important thing in choosing medicine is sufficient bactericidal power, followed by ease of use and avoidance of side effects, all of which must be paid attention to.</p>
<p>The medicine that meets the above standards should be "Anti-Lymph," a combination preparation of flavin and vaccine. Flavin has a very strong bactericidal power and can kill all bacteria, no matter how deeply they are hidden. Vaccine also produces antitoxins in the blood at the same time, making it impossible for gonococci to escape into the body. Therefore, it is equally applicable to acute and chronic gonorrhea and all complications.</p>
<p>"Anti-Lymph" is an internal medicine, so it is extremely convenient to use; it does not harm the stomach and intestines and will absolutely not cause any side effects; therefore, it is indeed the most ideal good medicine.</p>
<p>Female patients should also use the external medicine "Leucorrhea-Cure" to stop leucorrhea in order to achieve success.</p>
<p>The Enlightenment of Sex</p>
<p>— Dr. Zhan Nianceng</p>
<h3>Sex Education Should Be Implemented Early to Prevent Masturbation</h3>
<p>In childhood, one should be taught to cherish the local area and explain the harm of masturbation. In addition to detecting whether a person has the bad habit, one can also identify it by appearance.</p>
<p>If parents do not want their children to be harmed by masturbation, then it is imperative to instill sex education. Giving children sexual knowledge during puberty is not a very appropriate thing. It is better to teach them from a young age to cherish their reproductive organs and guide them about the harm of masturbation so that they understand it thoroughly. In addition, they should be taught to form such a habit: that is, if they have any questions about the reproductive organs, they should tell their parents frankly and without hesitation, because the reproductive organs are very easily unclean and easily susceptible to diseases, so they should pay close attention to hygiene at ordinary times. At the same time, it is impossible to avoid touching that part unnecessarily.</p>
<p>In this way, they will naturally know to cherish that part, and when any abnormality occurs, they will know to restrain themselves. Therefore, they will be able to prevent this bad habit, know about diseases, and prevent sexual missteps before they happen.</p>
<p>It is also said that because masturbation is extremely widespread from an early age, one cannot but personally observe whether general children are practicing masturbation. And because masturbation is almost always done in secret, this observation is very difficult.</p>
<p>However, although this statement has its reasons, we can still obtain external symptoms, such as pale complexion, often suffering from sorrow and terror, restless sleep, and neurasthenia. Then, based on the above-mentioned points of appearance, we can identify whether he has a masturbatory habit.</p>
<p>If we consider the impact of masturbation on sexual power, then practicing it in childhood can hinder the development of the sexual organs, frequent spermatorrhea, and as a result, the endocrine system is exhausted, leading to various obstacles after entering married life in the future. For women, it can cause menstrual disorders and uterine disorders, and there are many reasons for infertility that are completely caused by this. Therefore, treatment for masturbation-related diseases should be early. If you suffer from spermatorrhea, you can treat it with "Himidol's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets," which will heal in a short time. If you suffer from kidney deficiency, hindered local development, and various symptoms of neurasthenia, the best and most effective treatment should be to take the gonadal hormone preparation "Gonadin," because it truly has the ability to promote metabolism, and all kinds of venereal diseases are suitable for it.</p>
<p>Venereal Disease Lecture</p>
<h3>Compiled by Dr. Zhan Nianceng</h3>
<p>(Clinic) 2nd Floor, China Trust Company, Corner of Sichuan Road and Beijing Road Consultation hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Closed on Sundays.</p>
<p>(1) Infertility in Early Marriage is Due to Kidney Deficiency</p>
<p>Patient Wu Shangqin, 25 years old, from Xiamen, Fujian, has been running a tea business in Shanghai for ten years and lives in Xinshun Lane, Tianying Road. (Chief complaint) — I was inherently strong, but because of early marriage, my physique is weaker after marriage than before. I developed at the age of sixteen, and I held a wedding in the same year under the orders of my father. I was young and ignorant and indulged in excessive sexual activity. In addition, my body, which had just developed, was devastated by this, and gradually declined. Six months after marriage, my sexual function gradually felt weak, kidney deficiency, and occasional spermatorrhea. Although I have been treated repeatedly, there is no hope of a thorough cure. Therefore, ten years after marriage, I still have no children. The reason why my parents married me off early was to hug their grandchildren as soon as possible. Now, the opposite is true, and the disease has become more severe. This summer, I came to seek treatment on my own. (Symptoms at the time of consultation) — In addition to kidney deficiency, local development is also unsatisfactory. I have spermatorrhea two or three times a week, pale complexion, sperm depletion, and weak brain. (Treatment method) — I performed electrotherapy once a day and took "Himidol's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" to completely cure spermatorrhea and consolidate his sperm gate. I diagnosed that Mr. Zhao's kidney deficiency and underdevelopment were completely due to the loss of early marriage, which caused too much harm to the reproductive glands. Therefore, I used the gonadal hormone preparation "Gonadin" to treat him. He took two tablets three times a day to turn his weak reproductive glands from weak to strong, so that his sexual function could be completely restored to strength, his local development could also be improved, his endocrine system could also be vigorous, his sperm could be strong, his brain could be sufficient, and childbirth could be expected. After less than two months, his erectile power was unusually strong, and he felt full of energy and his development improved. To this day, his wife is already three months pregnant.</p>
<p>(2) Excessive Masturbation, Spermatorrhea, and Insomnia</p>
<p>Patient Cao Yuling, 24 years old, from Hangzhou. (Chief complaint) — I started masturbating at the age of ten, indulging in it excessively and losing energy. Soon, I had frequent spermatorrhea, tinnitus, headache, forgetfulness, insomnia, and other symptoms, which caused my body to be extremely weak, my face pale, and my muscles thin. I came to seek treatment on my own at the beginning of last month. (Symptoms at the time of consultation) — Spermatorrhea at least four times a week, insomnia and spermatorrhea at night. Drowsiness and weakness in the limbs during the day. (Treatment method) — I diagnosed that Mr. Cao suffered from the harm of masturbation, which caused the sperm gate to relax and spermatorrhea to occur frequently. Therefore, I instructed him to take "Himidol's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" to treat his spermatorrhea and at the same time, I administered the gonadal hormone preparation "Gonadin" to treat his various symptoms of neurasthenia. After about three weeks of treatment, the spermatorrhea stopped. After less than two months, the insomnia, headache, and other symptoms disappeared, and his complexion was also ruddy.</p>
<p>Common Sense on Quitting Smoking</p>
<h3>Me After Quitting Smoking</h3>
<p>— Feng Xinsheng</p>
<p>Mr. Editor: Since quitting smoking this summer, it's really like washing my face and reforming myself. I have become a healthy person again. I feel unprecedented joy in both mind and body. I am extremely proud of myself, and it is all thanks to the miracle drug "Gonadin" introduced in your publication. Therefore, I am writing this special letter to express my gratitude and briefly describe my experience of quitting smoking to inform those who are suffering from the same disease.</p>
<p>I was induced by bad friends to develop a fondness for smoking when I was nineteen years old. After that, I became addicted and forgot to return. I have been smoking for almost twenty years. Before I was forty, I was already old-looking, hunched over, thin, and pale. I am very sad to talk about my face full of smoke stains. I work in the business world and often need to travel outside. Although the journey is not far, I can still find ways to support myself. However, when getting on and off boats and cars, I am often searched by the military police, which is nothing more than my smoky appearance attracting attention.</p>
<p>This was already tiring enough. In addition, I have always been ambitious. I often heard people's cold remarks and taunts. When the trend of smoking was at its peak, I decided to quit regardless of my weak body. However, I lacked guidance and mistakenly took miscellaneous drugs, which caused great pain, and I failed. Therefore, I carefully inquired and finally learned from a colleague, Mr. Guan, that your publication introduced "Gonadin." I purchased and took "Gonadin" for six weeks in a row. Unconsciously, I did not suffer any pain, and my twenty-year addiction was severed. Moreover, my body is stronger than before, my limbs are strong, my smoky appearance is gone, and my spirit is bright. Friends and relatives are amazed when they see me. (Omitted below)</p>
<p>Editor's note: "Gonadin" functions to enhance the reproductive glands, enrich the source of life, and supply all parts of the body with sufficient vitality. Therefore, after taking it for five or six weeks, even the cells that have been ravaged by tobacco toxins and are becoming numb can regain vitality. Without the stimulation of opium, they can still function as usual, so the energy is strong enough to resist the effects of tobacco, and the body is not affected in any way when quitting.</p>
<h3>Sudden Stomach Pain</h3>
<p>Dr. Zhan Nianceng:</p>
<p>I have a stomach problem and often feel bouts of pain. At the same time, my appetite is not good, so my appetite is greatly reduced. Although I have taken many kinds of medicine, I have not been able to cure the root cause. I saw in the newspaper that "Stomach Pain Relief" can stop stomach pain, and "Stomach Strengthening Supplement" can help digestion. Therefore, I bought a box of each. After taking them, I frequently felt that the pain stopped immediately, and my digestion improved. I am now encouraged to introduce them. (Hu Sihan)</p>
<h3>Strangely Foul-Smelling Leucorrhea</h3>
<p>Dr. Zhan:</p>
<p>I don't know why, but my wife has severe discharge and a strange odor. Although I have visited famous gynecologists to seek treatment, it is always difficult to cure the root cause. Ms. Jugu, who lives with me, introduced my wife to use "Leucorrhea-Cure" for treatment. After less than ten days, the discharge stopped completely and has not recurred to this day. I have seen the efficacy of the medicine, so I am recording it specially for women to use (Chen Zhiguo)</p>
<h3>Towering Breasts</h3>
<p>Dr. Zhan:</p>
<p>My breasts have always been shriveled, and the development of all parts of my body is not good. Although I have sought treatment in many ways and have consulted with beauty salons several times, I can't always satisfy myself. This summer, I was fortunate to have a classmate guide me to take the female reproductive gland preparation "Gonadin," and it has started to improve. It has been two months since I started to improve, and they are already plump and towering, with a healthy and beautiful shape (Qian Wenjin)</p>
<h3>Winter Tonic</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhan:</p>
<p>Every year when winter comes, I must seek tonics, because my body is inherently weak and I have many diseases. In the past, I have taken bird's nest, ginseng, longan, and the like, but I have suffered from not having much effect. Starting last year, I used the gonadal hormone preparation "Gonadin" as a tonic. From spring to today this year, my body has been in good condition and my complexion is ruddy, which is what I have seen in recent years, according to the doctor: because "Gonadin" can promote the function of metabolism. (Yu Yongxian)</p>
<p>Female Beauty and Fertility</p>
<h3>Health and Beauty as a Prelude to Pregnancy</h3>
<p>— Wu Dachao, Bachelor of Medicine, University of Hong Kong</p>
<p>There are three unfilial acts, and having no offspring is the greatest. This is the old concept in our country. Multiplying children to propagate the country's population is the new concept of modern times. The two unanimously point out the importance of childbirth, and it can be seen that passing on the lineage is indeed the responsibility that men and women should bear after marriage. If women are unfortunately suffering from infertility, they should seek ways to save themselves as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Pregnancy has a direct relationship with the reproductive glands, so the cause of infertility is always nothing more than the weakness of the reproductive glands. Generally speaking, people with weak reproductive glands always have several common signs, so women with those signs are likely to be infertile. Irregular and inaccurate menstrual cycles and excessive leucorrhea are all ironclad evidence of endocrine disorders. The most easily seen symptom should be thin body and poor development. These women have absolutely no plump, smooth skin, no towering breasts that attract the attention of the opposite sex, and no happy, lively, and cute posture. They are not only suffering from infertility but also losing their beauty, which is indeed extremely sad.</p>
<p>The way to remedy this is to first take the female gonadal hormone preparation "Female Gonadin." This is made by Dr. Stannard by extracting the essence of the reproductive glands of healthy female animals. It can make weak reproductive glands become strong, the endocrine system vigorous, and development vigorous. After a short time, the menstrual period will be accurate, the skin will be ruddy and firm, and the breasts will change from flat to towering, full of elasticity. In addition, use "Leucorrhea-Cure" externally as a suppository to purify the vagina and eliminate leucorrhea. Then, by changing the old state and becoming a healthy and beautiful woman, the obstacles to childbirth are removed, and pregnancy can be expected.</p>
<p>Common Sense on Self-Treatment</p>
<h3>The Threat of Winter to Bone Pain Sufferers</h3>
<p>— Doctor Yu Bofu</p>
<p>The severe winter is indeed a cause for concern for the sick. From a medical standpoint, the impact on bone pain sufferers is particularly severe. Every year, sufferers not only experience increased pain during this cold winter, but also, due to weakened resistance, may even suffer from contractures of the limbs and abnormal numbness. Furthermore, those who are usually affected by rheumatism are able to withstand it because their resistance is able to hold up against it, thus avoiding the suffering of joint pain. However, once winter arrives, due to the harsh climate, everything falls into a state of decline, and resistance is also weakened. Therefore, the encroachment of rheumatism becomes unrestrained, causing damage everywhere, resulting in back pain, joint numbness, and various other symptoms erupting one after another. Therefore, this time is the most threatening for bone pain sufferers. However, with proper defense, not only can bone pain be avoided, but even those who have already contracted it can be completely cured. I have repeatedly tested this, and it is accurate to the slightest detail. This method should be used when one feels a lack of energy. At the beginning of winter, quickly take the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Reproductin" to replenish physical strength, so that the body's resistance is not disrupted by seasonal changes. At the same time, take "Strongston's Bone Pain Tablets," which have the functions of dispelling wind, removing dampness, purifying blood, and preventing arteriosclerosis, then the patient will definitely feel relaxed joints and completely eliminate pain.</p>

<h3>Exciting Beyond Expectations, Jinan Lost by Only Three Points, Defeated by Xintong 26 to 29, The Outcome of the Last Four Minutes Still Uncertain</h3>
<p>In the Xiqing Basketball Independent Group match, Jinan faced Xintong. The fierce battle ended last night, with Jinan unfortunately defeated by Xintong by a margin of three points, 26 to 29. In the first half, Jinan led by two points with a score of 14 to 12. Although Jinan lost, the performance was truly unexpectedly exciting. Xintong fought fiercely, only surpassing Jinan in the last four minutes. In those last four minutes, the score fluctuated closely, with each team scoring one point alternately for a long time. Thanks to Bersell's one successful free throw, Xintong was able to win by three points with a score of 29 to 26. The hardships endured during the game were evident, and the victory was not easily achieved. As for Jinan, they had a great opportunity to win last night, leading by as many as eight points at one point. However, due to a careless mistake, they allowed Xintong to take advantage of the opportunity to rise. Wang Nanzhen's performance was outstanding, and the center, Kuang Yao'ya, was fouled out, which was a fatal blow at the final moment. The Xiqing venue was packed, and in the last few minutes, the dramatic changes made everyone restless and extremely tense. It is hoped that Jinan will be able to retaliate in the second round. In another match, the Xin team defeated Mai Lingyi with a score of 40 to 17, with both teams scoring 15 points in the first half, which was also a highlight of the Independent Group.</p>
<p>Tight Defense, Nanzhen Was Able to Achieve This Result Last Night Due to Their Tight, Iron Wall-Like Defense. Xintong's Five Talents Found Themselves with Nowhere to Go in the First Half, Unable to Develop Their Game. Shi Guiya and Lan Mugen Both Failed to Score Until Later When Carson Attacked From Behind and Lan Yin Tenaciously Defended Under the Basket, Trying Every Possible Method for Xintong to Break Jinan's Formation. In Addition to a Tight and Unrelenting Defense, Jinan Rarely Gave Xintong a Chance to Shoot. In the Attack, They Also Adopted a Steady and Solid Approach. However, Many Shooting Opportunities in the First Half Were Missed, Which Was Extremely Regrettable. The Failure of All Free Throws Also Had a Significant Impact on the Outcome.</p>
<p>Golden Era After the Game Started, Lan Yin Scored First with Two Successful Free Throws. Yin Zeren Then Added a Goal, and Lan Yin and Han Zhenyuan Also Scored, Making It a Very Tense Situation with Each Team Having Four Points. Cai Yanxiong and Wang Nanzhen Each Scored a Goal, and Jinan Suddenly Led 8 to 4, Causing a Great Outcry. Yin Guiren and Kuang Yao'ya and Cai Yanxiong Each Added Another Goal, and Jinan Suddenly Overwhelmed Xintong 14 to 6, Their Momentum Was Unparalleled for a Time. This Was Truly Jinan's Golden Era. Only Two Minutes Were Left in the First Half. If Jinan Could Maintain This Excellent Situation, It Would Be Easier in the Second Half. Unfortunately, Between One Careless Moment, Bersell Shi Guiya Karl Went on a Consecutive Scoring Spree with Free Throws, Scoring Six Points in One Go, and Xintong Managed to Catch Up to 14 to 12 in the First Half, Jinan Leading by Only One Point.</p>
<p>Xintong Takes the Lead After This Fierce Battle in the First Half, Jinan's Physical Strength Has Become a Concern for the Audience. Although Wang Nanzhen Scored Two Points as Soon as He Entered the Field, the Tall Man Raine Scored Five Points with Two Successful Shots and One Free Throw, and Xintong Initially Took the Lead 17 to 16. What Was Worrying Was That Center Kuang Yao'ya Already Had Three Personal Fouls on His Record. In Less Than Two Minutes, He Was Indeed Fouled Out for the Fourth Time, and Yan Lianjin Replaced Him. Wang Nanzhen Switched to Playing Center, and Carson and His Teammates Then Scored Six Points in a Row, Taking the Lead Over Jinan for the Second Time with a Score of 21 to 18.</p>
<p>Final Hard Battle At That Time, There Were Only Four Minutes Left in the Game, and the Most Tense Situation Began to Unfold in These Four Minutes. After Jinan Fell Behind by Three Points, They Launched a Fierce Counterattack. Wang Nanzhen Made Two Successful Long-Range Shots, Regaining the Lead with a Score of 22 to 21. After Xintong Called a Timeout, the Tall Man Began to Stand Up Under Jinan's Basket. In a Moment of Reflection, It Was Targeted and Scored, But Wang Nanzhen Bravely Made a Third Long-Range Shot, Sending It Into Xintong's Net Again, Still Making It 22 to 23. The Tall Man's Second Lob Under the Basket Was Also Successfully Made, Plus Bersell's Fierce Attack, Xintong Scored Three More Points with 27 to 23. Although Yin Guiren Quickly Scored Back Two Points, Unfortunately, in the Last Few Seconds, Carson Scored Another Point With A Free Throw, Creating the Final Score Of 29 to 26.</p>
<p>Xintong</p>
<p>Jinan</p>
<p>First Half: Xintong 12, Jinan 14 Second Half: Xintong 17, Jinan 12</p>
<p>Xin Team Wins Over Mai Lingyi</p>
<p>Xin Team's Victory Over Mai Lingyi Was Initially Tight and Then Relaxed. Neither Team Was Able to Separate in the First Half, Each Scoring 15 Points. They Were Evenly Matched. Xin Team Had Many Good Opportunities That They Failed to Convert. Xin Team Scored the First Eight Points, and Mai Lingyi Scored Seven to Show Their Resistance. Xin Team Then Gave a Demonstration with 15 to 9. Mai Lingyi Then Added Extra Points to Show They Were Not Weak. From the Start of the Second Half, The Situation Greatly Transformed. Xin Team Scored Successively and Continuously, Moving Freely Under the Basket, Achieving What They Wished, Accomplishing Everything Smoothly. Mai Lingyi Then Suffered a Decisive Setback, Allowing Themselves to Be Trampled Upon, Resulting in 40 to 16. In the End, An Extra Point Was Scored with a Free Throw, Making It 40 to 17.</p>

<h3>Yue Fei's Childhood</h3>
<p>— Li Jizhen</p>
<p>—He never forgot to be a good person who was both "loyal and filial"—</p>
<p>Yue Wumu was born on the fifteenth day of the second month of the second year of Chongning during the reign of Emperor Huizong of the Song Dynasty (year 203 of the Christian era) in Tangyin County, Xiangzhou Prefecture, Henan. His father, named He, was a renowned scholar who often said, "Even if one is unfortunate enough to be born in a chaotic world, and is just an ordinary person without power or courage, one must never forget the nation and only seek to survive. Many people misunderstand Mr. Kongming's 'Seeking only to preserve life in troubled times, and not seeking fame among the lords,' thinking that being able to survive in troubled times is already a blessing, so why be overly ambitious? In fact, Mr. Kongming's 'preserving life' was about working hard to cultivate morality and learning. When his morality and learning matured, he would seize the opportunity to come out and work for the salvation of the country and its people. Look at him when he came out of his thatched hut, wasn't he accomplished in both literary talent and military strategy? This shows that when he was in the thatched hut, he was not only not 'preserving life,' but also working very hard. My ambition is to learn from Mr. Kongming." Therefore, Yue He worked very hard, either studying literature or practicing martial arts every day. Seeing the emperor's blindness and the officials' treachery in the court, he knew it would be difficult to meet a wise ruler like Kongming. However, he still refused to be discouraged and planned that if he was unsuccessful, he would pass on what he had learned to his son, and his son would pass it on to his grandson, generation after generation. He believed that his ambition and talent to stabilize the country would eventually be realized one day. He also thought, "To have good descendants, I can't rely on myself alone, I must find a good wife." He patiently chose, and finally got a beautiful, intelligent, and virtuous woman named Yao to be his wife.</p>
<p>This virtuous couple got along very well together. Yue He had no elders above him and no children below him, and his wife was thrifty, so the household expenses were very low. He had thousands of acres of fertile land, and most of the annual income was used to help the poor people in the neighborhood. They were happy to have a small family, firstly because they could save money and cultivate a frugal style, and secondly because they could save time, allowing his wife to spend half of her housekeeping time with him reciting scriptures and history.</p>
<p>Such happy and meaningful days passed particularly quickly, and in the blink of an eye, ten years had passed. Wumu was born on the tenth anniversary of Yue He and his wife's marriage. At that time, Yue He was already forty, and his wife was almost thirty. They finally got the little baby they had been waiting for for many years, and they were so happy that words could not describe it. They firmly believed that if they taught him properly, this beautiful jade would surely become a useful person. They placed all their hopes on their son and tried their best to teach him. They wanted to give him a good name that was meaningful, but they couldn't think of one after thinking for three days. It just so happened that the "Tangbinghui" (noodles feast) was to be held on the third day after the birth, according to custom. Yue He had become impoverished due to his benevolence and generosity over the past ten years, but he still wanted to take advantage of this "Tangbinghui" to invite the poor people in the neighborhood to have a good meal. He got up before dawn that day and ran to his good friend Zhou Tong, who lived ten miles away, to borrow money. If he took the main road from his home to Zhou's, it would take half a day, but if he took the mountain road, he could save most of the time. Because he was afraid of missing the time to invite guests, he preferred to take the mountain road, even though it was harder. As he walked, he thought about what to name his son. When he reached the top of the mountain, the sky suddenly turned completely dark, and the piercing wind was unbearably cold. Yue He exclaimed, "Now is mid-spring, even if it's going to rain, there shouldn't be such a cold wind. What kind of disaster is this?" After a while, the weather suddenly changed again, the sky was clear and the air was fresh, orioles were singing under the willows, and butterflies were dancing in front of the flowers. What beautiful scenery! Strangely enough, he stretched his neck and looked around, and saw a huge bird flying over from afar, covering the sky and the sun. Its momentum was majestic and it was a very magnificent sight. Therefore, he decided to call his beloved son "Fei."</p>
<p>He got the money and came back to tell his wife about what he had seen and how he named his son. His wife happily said, "I remember when the little baby was about to be born, there was a very loud sound on the roof. I asked you to go and see what was going on, and you said you only saw a big bird flying away in the distance, and nothing else. As soon as you finished speaking, my stomach started to hurt. What you saw today might be the same one as the other day. What is it? Could it be the Peng bird that Zhuangzi spoke of? How about we give him another name, "Pengju"?" Yue He listened and agreed very much.</p>
<p>Yue's wife's family was in Neihuang County, Daming Prefecture, Hebei. They were originally a wealthy scholarly family, but they had declined in recent years. There was an old mother and a younger brother in the family, who lived by farming. When Yue Fei was almost a month old, his mother's family sent someone to take her home, saying that the old lady missed her so much that she was sick, and wanted her to return to Neihuang to visit her parents. Yue's wife was a filial daughter. Hearing that her mother was sick, she couldn't wait to have wings to fly home and serve her mother. Yue He sympathized with her and told her to take her son and the messenger to leave two days earlier. He would have to finish his son's full-month celebration before he could leave home, because he had already invited many relatives and friends from afar to come to drink喜酒(wedding/celebration) on the full-month day, and he didn't have time to decline them one by one, so he had to stay at home to entertain them himself. Yue's wife returned to her mother's home. The old lady was very happy to see her daughter and her newborn grandson after a long separation, and her illness improved a lot.</p>
<p>That day, the mother and daughter talked happily until late at night. Unexpectedly, there was a great flood in Neihuang in the middle of the night, and the whole county turned into a swamp. Yue's wife's younger brother staggered in and said to her, "Sister, the flood is here. I have to take care of the old lady. You have to find a way to escape by yourself. I can't take care of you." As he spoke, he carried his mother on his back and walked to a higher place. Yue's wife hurriedly picked up Yue Fei and went out to find a way to survive. The water rose higher and higher, and soon it had submerged her thighs. Yue's wife didn't know what to do. Suddenly, she touched a large water vat floating beside her. Without thinking, she sat in the vat, tightly holding Yue Fei in her arms, and listened attentively to the flying sounds and the sound of the water all around, mixed with the cries of refugees near and far. The water vat drifted to the shore with the current, and Yue's wife and son survived. When the water receded at dawn, people saw them and everyone said it was a miracle. Yue's wife's mother and younger brother were also fortunate to survive. The mother, daughter, and siblings were very happy to see each other. Yue He rushed over as soon as he heard the news of the flood and took his wife's family to Tangyin. The next day was Yue Fei's full-month celebration. Everyone was drinking celebration wine of family reunion, while shedding tears of pain and grief.</p>
<p>Time passed quickly, and several years passed. Yue's wife's mother and younger brother had already returned to Neihuang. Yue Fei had grown into an exceptionally clever and sensible child. Although Yue He and his wife liked him very much, they were unwilling to indulge him because they hoped that he would become a useful person. When Yue Fei was four years old, his father asked him to go to the study to study. Yue Fei was both smart and hardworking. By the time he was twelve years old, he had already finished reading the Four Books, Five Classics, and the works of various philosophers and historians. At this time, Yue He could barely make a living by farming. Yue Fei brought food to the fields every day, and when he saw his father weeding and plowing the fields, sweating like rain, and working very hard, he wanted to stay in the fields to work for his father. His father, because he was young and afraid of delaying his study time, always coaxed him with gentle words, saying that farming was the most interesting and least tiring work. He understood his father's meaning and didn't dare to argue with his father, so he had to come back with tears in his eyes. When he got home, he was afraid that his mother would see his sad face, so he wiped away his tears before he dared to enter the house. But he always felt that it was a shame and embarrassing for a son to be unable to support his parents.</p>
<p>One day, he was sitting in the study, and he thought of his father working hard in the fields again. He saw the piles of books in front of him and couldn't help but sigh, "What's the use of reading ten thousand volumes of books if a son can't support his parents?" He thought of what the ancients said, "The father chops wood, but the son cannot carry the load." He couldn't help but cry out loud.</p>
<p>Yue's wife was a smart woman. Although Yue Fei didn't dare to show any signs of unhappiness in front of her, she had already seen through Yue Fei's concerns. She just didn't say it, and paid attention to observing her son's actions. That day, she was mending clothes in the house when she suddenly heard her son crying. She quickly put down her needle and thread and went to the study to see what was going on. When Yue Fei saw his mother, he knew he couldn't hide it, and he couldn't help but kneel down. Yue's wife quickly helped him up, used her sleeve to wipe away his tears, and asked softly, "My son, what unhappy things do you have at such a young age? Can you tell Mother?"</p>
<p>When Yue Fei heard his mother's words, he couldn't help but cry again. After a while, he said intermittently, "Mother—I... I bring Father's food to the fields every day, and I see... I see him working too hard. I can't bear to let Father suffer like this. I want to work for him, but he... he won't let me, so I don't feel good. But I still don't understand that I am an unfilial person. Just now I thought of what the ancients said, 'The father chops wood, but the son cannot carry the load.' Then I knew I was unfilial, because Father is farming and I'm not doing anything. Isn't that unfilial? I hate unfilial and disloyal people the most. How can you not hate myself?" As he said this, he cried again, and said as he cried, "Mother—I don't want to be an unfilial son. Can you think of an idea for me?"</p>
<p>When Yue's wife heard her son's words, she was filled with mixed feelings of sadness and joy. She was sad because the family was poor, which exhausted her husband and worried her son. She was happy that her son, who was so young, was so filial, could study, and knew how to be a person. Although she cherished Yue Fei's health, she liked Yue Fei's virtues even more. She wanted to help him become a filial son. So she said to Yue Fei:</p>
<p>"My son, get up! Mother has thought of an idea for you. It's true, 'The father chops wood, but the son cannot carry the load' is unfilial. But you are still young. Since you are determined to help your father, wait until Mother tells him and asks him to let you work in the fields."</p>
<p>Yue Fei went to farm on the first day. He was enthusiastic and worked hard, and worked better than anyone else. At first, he still needed his father to teach him, but later he was able to do everything independently. He worked during the day and studied at night, and he didn't waste any time. He didn't have money to buy lamp oil, so he went to the fields to collect firewood, burned it in the yard at night, and sat in front of the firewood pile to read. He did the same in summer. The firewood smoke blackened his face and his clothes were soaked with sweat. He would only wash himself clean when it was dawn. The villagers all praised him, saying that he was a hard-working and filial son. A Mr. Li liked Yue Fei so much that he wanted to marry his only daughter to him as his daughter-in-law.</p>
<p>Yue Fei had grown to be eighteen years old, and his learning and character had made amazing progress. He was very calm and rarely spoke. But seeing his upright and solemn attitude, everyone knew that he was a child of integrity. Because he was willing to move, his strength was very great, and he could draw a strong bow and pull a strong crossbow. He liked to read widely, and his favorite books were the Zuo Zhuan and Sun Tzu's Art of War.</p>
<p>That year, after the autumn harvest, because it was a bumper year, the farmers were celebrating together. Yue He and his wife were invited to drink wine at a neighbor's house, leaving Yue Fei and his daughter-in-law to guard the house. Yue Fei sent his parents to the neighbor's house, came back, closed the bamboo fence gate, pulled the bow and practiced archery in the yard, changed his clothes, and sat on the grass in the sun, loudly reciting Sun Tzu's Art of War.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, his father's good friend Zhou Tong happened to come to visit. Zhou Tong was a famous scholar from Shaanxi, who was accomplished in both literature and martial arts, and had the divine skill of good archery. Because his only son died in the border fighting against the Liao, he was too heartbroken to live in his hometown, so he specially came to Tangyin, Henan, to be a hermit. He rarely socialized, but he especially liked Yue He's heroism and righteousness. When Yue Fei was five years old, he left Tangyin and traveled around. He knew that Yue Fei was an extraordinary person, and after wandering for thirteen years, he finally wanted to return to Tangyin to see this smart child. In the thirteen years, everything in Yue's Village had changed. The small green willows that he left had now grown into trees that could be embraced. The children who used to stare at strangers with curiosity still followed him around, but none of them were the same faces. He remembered that Yue's house was not far from here. He was just about to find someone to ask for directions when he suddenly heard clear reading sounds not far ahead, which were very pleasant. He could tell that it was a young boy's voice, and he was reading Sun Tzu. He thought, "Whose family has such a promising child? Could it be the son of a general?" He followed the sound of the reading to the bamboo fence and recognized that this was Yue's house. He was just about to knock on the door when the dog's barking had already startled Yue Fei. Yue Fei saw a heroic and kind old man standing outside the fence gate. He hurriedly opened the door and respectfully invited the elder in. He respectfully asked for his name and only then did he know that this was his father's good friend Zhou Tong, who had come from thousands of miles away to visit. He hurriedly went to the neighbor's house to inform his father. The good friends were reunited, and everyone was infinitely happy.</p>
<p>Zhou Tong highly valued Yue Fei and was determined to pass on his talents and archery skills to him. Yue He knew that Zhou Tong was a great master and was afraid of missing the opportunity, so he immediately ordered his son to come and worship him as his teacher. That night, the Yue family held a grand banquet to welcome Zhou Tong, and the next day, Zhou Tong began to teach.</p>
<p>At that time, Zhou Tong was already old. He knew that he had been sad for half his life and would not live long. He was afraid that his knowledge would be lost, so he taught his disciples wholeheartedly day and night. Yue Fei also respected his teacher very much. He did whatever his teacher told him to do. He had a firm heart and strong spirit, and his body was strong. He didn't feel tired even if he used his brain and strength all day long. The more he learned, the more motivated he became. After learning archery for two years, he could draw a strong bow of three hundred catties and shoot a strong crossbow of eight stones. He had learned all of Zhou Tong's skills and could shoot with both hands. Yue Fei was grateful to Zhou Tong for teaching him so painstakingly, and he pitied him for having no children in his old age. He intended to serve him as if he were his father, so that he could live his later years in peace and happiness. Unexpectedly, Zhou Tong did not receive any reward from Yue Fei. He died after being sick for a few days.</p>
<p>Yue Fei held his benefactor's body and cried bitterly. He buried Zhou Tong in his hometown so that he could come to sweep his tomb often. He picked up a book and thought of his teacher, often sighing at the book. He held a bow and thought of his teacher, and couldn't help but shed tears as he shot the crossbow. Every first and fifteenth day of the month, he would definitely visit Zhou Tong's tomb to worship him, and he never changed the date, rain or shine. When Yue He saw how righteous he was, he couldn't help but praise him:</p>
<p>"Son! If you are ever used by the world, you will definitely be a person who sacrifices yourself for the country and dies for righteousness."</p>
<p>Yue Fei listened and couldn't say anything for a long time. His father said again:</p>
<p>"Son, the national crisis is getting worse day by day. Your father is old, and the hope of saving the country and its people rests on your shoulders. There are not few loyal ministers and righteous people in ancient and modern times. Son, I hope you will be the most pure and complete one."</p>
<p>Yue Fei said, "Dad, I will always remember your teachings today. I must be the most pure and complete one."</p>
<p>At that time, Song's diplomatic policy of using Jin to drive away Liao had turned into inviting a wolf into the house. The Jin people captured Yanjing, and not only refused to return the lost land, but also planned to invade Song. Emperor Huizong was a useless person who only sought his own pleasure and knew nothing about diplomacy and national affairs. He ended up with both foreign and domestic troubles breaking out, and he couldn't find a way to clean things up. Yue He knew that this was the time for righteous people to make contributions and serve the country, so he wanted Yue Fei to join the army. So he took the opportunity to say to Yue Fei, "Son, if you want to save the country and its people, now is the opportunity. Go and join the army."</p>
<p>Yue Fei was determined to join the army, but he was afraid that his parents would have no one to take care of them at home, so he hesitated and dared not agree immediately. Fortunately, his father knew the reason why he couldn't make up his mind, so he quickly said to him, "Son, saving the country is much more important than serving your parents. Saving the country and serving your parents are two sides of the same coin. If the country is destroyed, your parents will lose their support. What's the use of just talking about serving your parents? Besides, we don't necessarily need you by our side right now. The remaining food at home can support us for a year if we are frugal. Your daughter-in-law can replace you in taking care of us in the morning and evening. Son, make up your mind and go!"</p>
<p>At this time, Liu Xuanfu of Zhending was recruiting soldiers. Yue Fei told his parents and went to enlist. Yue Fei received an order to suppress bandits as soon as he arrived at the camp. He led a hundred soldiers and destroyed two major bandits in Xiangzhou, each with tens of thousands of people. His superiors were about to promote him when he received a letter saying that his father was seriously ill. He rushed home without caring about anything. Yue He was already seriously ill, his face turned gray and white, and he was lying in bed, unable to move his limbs. His head was facing out of the house, and his eyes were wide open, as if waiting for something. When he heard that Yue Fei had returned, his head suddenly lifted up and he reached out for someone to help him up. The people in the family were rejoicing that his illness had taken a turn for the better, but who knew that he could only say one sentence, "Son, you're back!" before falling back dead. Yue Fei and his mother held the body and cried as if they were dying. Yue Fei was afraid of hurting his mother too much, so he endured his tears and comforted her while taking care of the funeral arrangements. After a hundred days, the funeral was completed according to etiquette.</p>
<p>At that time, Yue Fei was already twenty years old. He didn't make any decisions on his own. He reported everything to his loving mother. Yue's wife allowed him to observe mourning at home, working in the fields for half a day every day, and spending the rest of his time practicing martial arts and studying history. Yue Fei never forgot his father's last teachings and was determined to fulfill his father's unfinished ambition. He often thought, "I heard that 'the ancients sought loyal ministers from the homes of filial sons.' Before becoming a purely loyal minister, one should first become a purely filial son." He was originally a person of utmost filial piety by nature, and now he was even more determined to reach the realm of pure and complete filial piety. Countless evil people and wicked sons from far and near changed their ways after hearing of his good deeds.</p>
<p>At that time, the rebel Yang Yao was causing trouble in Huguang. He heard people say that Yue Fei was a talented person and wanted to recruit him. He sent people to Tangyin with humble words and generous gifts to invite Yue Fei. Yue Fei sternly and righteously rebuked the messengers and sent them back. He then told Yue's wife about everything that had happened and knelt at his mother's knees, weeping and saying:</p>
<p>"Mother! Your child has been taught by both parents since childhood, and I have never forgotten to be a good person who is both 'loyal and filial.' I think everyone should understand this honest and upright heart. Your child doesn't understand why someone would dare to invite your child to be a traitor who betrays the country and abandons his parents. Could it be that your child has done something wrong that makes people look down on me?"</p>
<p>"My son, don't be sad, and don't despise yourself too much. Even saints cannot avoid the losses you have suffered today. You must only make your determination even firmer, and be even more careful in your actions. When evil people see your steadfastness, they will naturally not dare to invade you." As Yue's wife said this, she suddenly thought of a way to make her son's determination even stronger. She ordered Yue Fei to bring the incense table, light the incense and candles, and ordered Yue Fei to take off his shirt and kneel reverently to the sky. She pulled out a small silver hairpin from her hair and tattooed the four words "Serve the Country with Utmost Loyalty" on Yue Fei's back. As she tattooed the words, she told her son:</p>
<p>"Son! Mother is getting old and may leave you sooner or later. There are many bad people in troubled times, and young people are most easily deceived. I'm afraid that as soon as I let go, you will forget your family teachings and learn bad things from others. Therefore, I tattooed the four words "Serve the Country with Utmost Loyalty" on your back, so that you will always remember Mother's teachings and take on the responsibility of "Serving the Country with Utmost Loyalty."</p>
<p>Their sincerity dominated everything, so the loving mother endured the pain of tattooing her back, and the son didn't feel any pain at all.</p>
<p>Later, Yue Fei joined the army, defeated the Jin soldiers, and saved the Song Dynasty from destruction. Because he wanted to achieve "pure completeness" and "utmost loyalty," he ultimately sacrificed himself for the country. The reason why he had such great talent and supreme virtue was entirely due to his good upbringing in his youth.</p>

<h3>"Collected Education Broadcast Lectures"</h3>
<p>— Yingfu</p>
<p>Volume 1: Public Education</p>
<p>The educational broadcast lectures organized by the Ministry of Education began in October of the 24th year of the Republic (1935). These lectures were divided into two aspects: one was about secondary education, and the other was about public education. Both were held simultaneously until the winter vacation of last year, when they were temporarily suspended. Here, the first volume of the Collected Education Broadcast Lectures (Secondary Education), which we are about to introduce, is the first aspect of the educational broadcast lectures held by the Ministry of Education last year, edited by the ministry and recently published by the Commercial Press.</p>
<p>The motivation and process of the Ministry of Education organizing educational lectures has already been explained by the Minister of Education in the first lecture, so there is no need for us to repeat it. What we want to talk about here is a little feeling that we had after reading the lecture collection. First, let's talk about the classification of the speeches. The content of the lecture collection is divided into four categories: (1) Youth Training; (2) Subject Lectures; (3) Education Lectures; and (4) Current Affairs Lectures. Such a method of material distribution is not wrong in terms of the above four items. However, what we consider a minor dissatisfaction is the distribution of the quantity of speeches under the four items. For example, the speeches on youth training, which is in the first category, should have been particularly emphasized according to the needs of secondary school students, and their length should have accounted for at least half or one-third of the entire collection. However, in reality, there are only four articles, which occupy the smallest position compared with the speeches in other categories. For example, the speeches on subject lectures, which is in the second category, should have been second only to the first category, but in reality, they occupy as many as eighteen articles. This improper distribution of materials is certainly not the responsibility of the editors, but should be the responsibility of the organization that organized the educational broadcast lectures. In other words, the Education Department should pay attention to the youth training category in the distribution of lecture materials, or give equal importance to this category and the subject lecture category. Furthermore, there is another small flaw in the quantity of content, which is the omission of materials. For example, in the youth training category, there should be a speech on the student movement, explaining clearly the meaning, history, past mistakes, and the path that should be taken now. Also, school unrest is also a very important issue, and there should be a speech by a famous educator, giving a correct answer to schools and students. Also, in the education lecture category, only one lecture involved the service problem of normal school students, but there was no lecture on the problems of further education, employment, and unemployment of general secondary school graduates. These are all the points that we consider to be lacking.</p>
<p>Next, let us talk about the quality of the content of this lecture collection. In this aspect, we cannot find any dissatisfaction. All thirty-four lectures collected in the collection can be said to have their own outstanding and correct views, either giving guidance on the cultivation of secondary school students, or providing assistance to their studies, or expanding their common knowledge. This is what we think is most beneficial to them. From this point, we can affirm that the educational lectures held last year were very successful and effective.</p>
<p>Now, let's cite the advantages of two lectures to prove the above praise. For example, the elements of modern youth's cultivation of learning and virtue, as spoken by Luo Jialun, has quite outstanding and correct ideas. He put forward three elements that must be possessed by modern youth in their cultivation: (1) the scientific spirit of seeking knowledge; (2) the living habits of soldiers; (3) the competitive ethics of athletes. Furthermore, he further divided the second element into four points, namely (incomplete)</p>

<h3>The Death of a Servant</h3>
<p>— Wu Ci</p>
<p>Some nouns are unremarkable to the ears of Shanghainese, but bewildering to outsiders. For example, "servant." Even the most erudite scholars probably couldn't unearth its origins in ancient texts. Yet, in Shanghai, even women and children know what kind of person it refers to.</p>
<p>Though "servant" is a common term in Shanghai, its commonness does not diminish its baseness. Those who call others "servant" adopt an air of superiority. And the servant, upon hearing a call, would hastily and respectfully respond with "Yes, Master!" This is especially true in foreign firms or the homes of wealthy foreigners. They often employ Chinese servants, primarily because they appreciate their submissive demeanor and that respectful "Yes, Master!"</p>
<p>However, once one's status becomes lowly, one's character seems unable to elevate. The reason is simple: noble people do noble deeds, while the base naturally become vulgar. This isn't necessarily due to their inherent nature, but rather the "defense in depth" strategy of the noble class. A vast chasm is clearly drawn between servants and masters. Those on the servant's side are often labeled as "vulgar and filthy," while those on the master's side are always associated with "morality" and so on. This can be demonstrated with an example:</p>
<p>"Chen Yaosheng, a local man working as a servant for a certain foreigner, was suspected of stealing an electric heater that the foreigner had lost a few days ago. The foreigner dismissed Chen, and Chen subsequently committed suicide by poison. After the discovery, he was rushed to the hospital, but the treatment was ineffective, and he died immediately... The court prosecutor determined that Chen Yaosheng died from poisoning and instructed his family to arrange the funeral."</p>
<p>Of course, in the eyes of foreigners, the suicide of a mere servant is less stimulating than Romeo's suicide in Shakespeare's tragedy "Romeo and Juliet." Moreover, suicide is the act of the weak, so there's no need for sympathy. The fact that they didn't attribute terms like "discovered conscience and died of shame" to Chen Yaosheng is already generous enough.</p>
<p>Although we do not advocate suicide, we cannot help but feel moved by the death of Chen Yaosheng. This "feeling" arises from the position of servants and their lowly duties. Servants generally lack much knowledge, which is a fact. However, lacking knowledge does not necessarily make someone vulgar, which is also a fact. And precisely because their minds are simple, they retain a bit of innocence in this hypocritical and cunning society. This innocence provides "intellectuals" with plenty of laughable material in their actions. For example, being falsely accused of theft is not a reason for suicide. If we were to put ourselves in his place, suppose the one who lost something (certainly not an electric heater) was the servant, and the master was suspected of theft. Then, the master would either dismiss it with a "haha" or slap the servant with his giant hand. And the onlookers in society would express a sense of justice and speak up in unison:</p>
<p>"How could he be a thief? Are you trying to frame him out of sheer boredom!"</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, even if the master really likes to steal, his top hat and formal attire would still be respected. Poor Chen Yaosheng, he didn't know these things. He didn't know that in this society, the more upper-class a person is, the more they engage in theft. Not only is their mask never pierced after they do it, but even if it is, they still let others laugh and scold as they please, and the gentleman continues to be himself. Fortunately, many so-called "righteous" people in society are allied with these "gentlemen." When they see the gentleman's mask about to be pierced, they will unite to cover it up because they know that if the lips are gone, the teeth will be cold, and they also fear that the rabbit's death will cause the fox to grieve.</p>
<h3>Yangjia Port</h3>
<p>— Yunhai</p>
<p>Autumn. Without towering waves, the sea cannot pile up great mountains. Looking from afar, it seems only small waves chase and play, which is quite endearing.</p>
<p>Two or three sea eagles soar in mid-air. Their thick wings move vigorously as if keeping time, embellishing the entire blue-green sky with peace and gentleness. When their sharp and keen eyes spot the schools of fish chasing each other in groups of three or five, their steel-hard beaks point downward, and the weight of their bodies is unbalanced again. They fly down quickly, splashing lightly on the water’s surface, catching their prey with a gentle peck. Then, with a turn of the head and a squeak, they shoot straight into the clouds. Such flight is extremely swift and agile, so fast that even the human eye is dazzled.</p>
<p>Over there, protruding behind two embrace-like small peaks is a naturally dangerous islet – this is Yangjia Port. Many fishermen have buried their happy lives here for the sake of livelihood. At the same time, several years ago, many lucky people relied on this mountain to make a fortune and put on silk clothes. However, that was in the past. Now, this desolate natural fishing net has had its path cut off by the fishermen upstream of the West River. Whole schools of fish rarely come to this aging Yangjia Port anymore. At this time, only small sailboats that have split up and make a living by salvaging are left.</p>
<p>On that phosphorous-nitrate shore, where the waves crash, there are often three or five half-naked fisherwomen, opening a large net, facing the shallow water. Spending about</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>the time it takes for a bell to strike, they stretch out their poor, greedy eyes towards that tattered fishing net, pinning on a hope.</p>
<p>"Pah! That damn ×! Yellow plague!"</p>
<p>The net only catches struggling jumping river shrimp, along with a few silvery white small fish. Thus, they are disappointed, and they curse resentfully from the bottom of their hearts.</p>
<p>Slap – shush shush</p>
<p>A dark wave, surging from who knows where, crashes violently onto the cliffs. Unable to stand firm, she is knocked down. Her body leans to one side, and the rope tangles, but those walking beside her quickly pull it taut, finally managing to steady her footing and stand up. She mutters and curses:</p>
<p>"What gale is coming from that ocean? It's hitting your old lady so hard! Late autumn, right at high tide..."</p>
<p>"Sister-in-law, I don't think this is a good sign? Look, the sky over there is covered by a pile of dark clouds. I'm afraid the wind and rain will rush over here in no time!"</p>
<p>The young sister-in-law advises the sister-in-law who can't stand steadily, as if she's full of experience. The sister-in-law then regains her senses. Her mouth opens and closes in panic, and then she gasps as if taking a breath:</p>
<p>"Let's go! Let's go! The headwind is no joke. I'm afraid we won't make it back to the village! That damn ×:…"</p>
<p>Over there, the small sailboats that came with them are all craning their necks. Everyone is hurrying to haul in their nets. Once the nets are collected, the people get on board. Then they have to furl the sails - nine out of ten sails will fall in the wind. Thus, they frantically and chaotically yell and call out. The tranquility of just now has been frightened away to who knows where. The dark clouds have spread their wings and covered over. A burst of darkness scares people into even more chaos. The sea eagles in the sky have disappeared to who knows where. All that remains here is terror, panic, and a fear like the approach of a great disaster.</p>
<p>Exhausting their strength, these small sailboats, like fish on a string, struggle close to the opposite shore.</p>
<p>"Yo ay yo, ya wei... Ah, yo, ay yo..."</p>
<p>It seems like a cry of despair, and it seems like the moan of the weak. Here, it is drowned out by this low, depressed, life-seeking, upward melody.</p>
<p>Woo woo! Woo!</p>
<p>The wind gradually gathers from all directions, howling demonstratively. The dark clouds, swirling in the air like a vicious bird, have now completely covered the sea. Everything has sunk into the gloomy atmosphere. The autumn waves stirred up by the wind are bigger than everything else. Surging up from a small hill, forming giant waves higher than the boats, like a magician's hand, cruelly and wantonly teasing these small sailboats struggling for survival. The bow of the small boat collides with the greedy, insatiable wave mountain that is opening its mouth, and is unnaturally thrown into the air, and then unnaturally thrown down again. It rolls and tumbles in this up-and-down manner.</p>
<p>The people on the boat are as solemn as Buddha statues. They rely on their experience to fight against the fate of death. The helmsman is steady and determined. The one rowing the oars at the front of the boat now seems to have completely lost consciousness, only knowing to strain the red veins in his forehead as he rows. The young children have also forgotten to laugh and play, and are scooping buckets and buckets of bilge water with an adult air.</p>
<p>Rain also attacks from all directions. Hitting people's faces, hands, and skin, it is a spicy, stinging pain. However, the struggle, the people are singing about this courageous fight.</p>
