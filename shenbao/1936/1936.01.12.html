<p>— 黃馥</p>
<p>關於租稅增收，來年頂計如第五表所示：</p>
<p>第五表來年度租稅預計（單位千圓）</p>
<p>（與本年度比較增减）所得稅　三三二、〇〇〇　三六、〇〇〇地租　五八、〇〇〇——營業收益稅　六二、〇〇〇　一一、〇〇〇資本利子稅　一五、〇〇〇——相續稅　三二、〇〇〇　三、六〇〇酒稅　二〇九、〇〇〇　三、〇〇〇砂糖消費稅　八七、〇〇〇　九、〇〇〇織物消費稅　四二、〇〇〇　九、〇〇〇交易所稅　一四、〇〇〇　一、六〇〇關稅　一五八、〇〇〇　二八、〇〇〇印花收人　七九、〇〇〇　二、五〇〇</p>
<p>（以上數字包含因製鐵獎勵法之改正而來的三百萬圓，及礦油稅改正而來的四百萬圓在內—十一月二十七日「東京朝日一）</p>
<p>從上列數字看來，增收最主要的是所得稅和營業收益稅，减收主要的是酒稅交易所稅和印花收人。這種自然增收裹面，我們看出收入增加的主要是以查定為基礎的諸稅；實質上因為景氣恢復而增加的印花稅，酒稅，交易所稅等等都不僅不增而反見减少。所以我們可以知道道種自然增收不足以表示經濟界情况轉佳，而祇能說明稅收技術的改善和查定的更加嚴厲，此外譬如關稅的增加，這也並不由於景氣的轉機，而是由於關稅率的改訂。（這事實祗要看噸稅增加並不很多就可以知道），所以財政當局認為財政改善的所謂「自然」增收，本質上祇是「强權」增收的變名，因為由於强權和人力，所以他的增收也有一定的限度，他的增加率的决不能和激增的軍事費並行，那更是一目暸然的事了。</p>
<p>第二，是特別會計的援助（通融），這很明白的祗是為着緩和頂算編成之困難而一時借用的方法，據十一月二十七日「東京朝日」所載，來年度預算中從歷來絕不流用的特別會計裏面通融的數目是一千二百五十萬圓，計：</p>
<p>第六表　特別會計來年度通融金額（單位千元）</p>
<p>鐵道省所管（特別會計剩餘金的二成）五、四〇〇</p>
<p>拓務省所管（朝鮮、台灣、樺太、南洋廳各特別會計剩餘金的一成）五、〇〇〇</p>
<p>遞信省所管（通信事業特別會計剩餘金的二成）二、一〇〇</p>
<p>合計　一二、五〇〇</p>
<p>這種通融除出表示財源枯竭之外，很明白地還可以看出為着替中央一般會計分擔赤字而犧牲殖民地財政的方案。至於第三，就是因為軍部熊度强硬，不得不承認了二千萬元的復活要求，一方面叉沒有方法再從公債上尋覓塡補，而終於東拼西凑地從各省羅掘零星財源的——所謂「各省協力預算」，在這兒羅掘所及的除出再從鐵道，遞信，拓務三省通融特別會計之外，甚至想入非非地由工商省命令日本製鐵會社提高股息，再從道政府官股收入增加項下撥付二百八十萬元的零欵（日本製鐵資本大概億五千九百萬，內官股二億八千萬，的占百分之八〇，頂計股息從六厘增加至七厘）！</p>
<p>從上述觀察，可以知道所謂赤字公債漸减，一方面祇是一種用財政手段的末技來一時糢糊的撑門而的口號，他方面從這些財政手段裹面表示出財政前途的極端的不安和因這種不安而引起的一種財政技術汎繫化的需要。</p>
<p>總之，包含着十億五千萬之鉅額軍事費的非常時頂算，總算七拼八凑地編定了，可是今後呢？徇金融資本家的要求，赤字公債在面子上是减少了，但是軍事費却依舊無止境地在擴張着，國內財源，早已經枯涸了，一般加稅，用加重貧窮國民的負擔來滿足軍事費的要求，事質己經不像想像那樣的簡單，今年地方選舉的無產黨的進展，一年來的勞働爭議與小作爭議的質的亢揚與量的增加，都表示了高橋聲明中的「天災不斷，民生憔悴，社會政策上有許多地方値得考慮」的不單是一種杞憂，在大陸方面，冒險主義者雖則僥倖地獲得了一大塊肥肉，可是在自己胃臟里面，遺憾地早巳經沒有了消化這肥肉而使之成為自身滋養分的胃液！明年是海軍軍擴競爭的年頭，那時候再用些什麼來供奉這無饜的要求？</p>
<p>由八十二歲的老翁的「超人的」努力所完成的「赤字公債漸减」，使日本財界暫時得到了一點英雄主義的興奮和安心，可是等這種興奮冷靜之後，安心很快地跟着也動搖了，公債漸减，可是歲出的赤字依然！於是他們就對於這恒久化的軍事費的擴張開始凝視和憂慮了。克服它呢還是被克服？在來年度頂算赤字公債漸减之點，門面上是金融家克服了軍部了，可是軍事費數字上不還是依舊增加了三千八百萬嗎？實質上還是被克服了。「東京朝日」十二月一日和二日的評論，是極富於暗示的。</p>
<p>「現在遠東的國際情勢，日本占有指導的地位，已為極明瞭的事實，旣然已經占有指導者的地位，國際情勢的緩急調節，日本在某種程度當然有左右的可能。這就是對於軍事費付與一定彈力性之可能的根據。在軍事費中當然有絕對的要素，但是將一切軍事費都認為有絕對性而使財政計書在他前面低頭，那是在軍事當局也該仔細的考慮的問題」（一日：「依然的糊塗預算」）</p>
<p>「軍事費十億五千萬圓，占總頂算的百分之四十七。比本年度增加了三千八百萬圓，參謀本部的要求雖則讓了步，但是假使這樣還是不能滿意，那麼這種傾向繼續到什麼時候為止？正和荒木前陸相所說的滿洲事變費平年化在那一年實現同樣地是國民所無法估定的事情。對於這種軍事費的擴大沒有一定的國策，實在是使國民極度不安的事情。</p>
<p>「在這種意味，相信了國體明微的國民，同時還希望着國防的明暸化和樹立對國防的國策。在預算閣議上協力了閣僚們，應該拿出些比拼凑財源更大的努力，不要被軍部扯着走，大家協力在獨自的天地樹立國策，同時軍部的自主性也請顧到指導國際情勢的實力，對於軍事費的將來，對國民給與一個展望和安心。」（二日：「軍事費的將來及國策的樹立」）</p>
<p>這種希望究竟能吾現實呢？最近軍部所取的姿勢和上面所說及的事實，都巳經表明了道回答是悲觀而吾定的了。（一九三五年十二月二十四日於京都）</p>

<p>第六屆全國運動大會、於去年十月十日在上海市中心區之大體育塲舉行、會期凡十一日、至十月二十日止、參加者共三十八單位、男女選手共二千七百餘人、爲空前未有之盛、滬市新建之大體育塲、建築之偉大、設備之完全、獨步遠東、允爲大會生色不少、自開幕以後、共用經費十五萬元、而男女山徑賽成績打破全國紀錄者、也頗不少、此皆足以證明我國體育已有長足之進步、</p>
<p>舉辦敎育播音</p>
<p>本部鑑於無綫電播晋敎育之重要、於去年十月十日舉辦敎育播音、先由部訓練無錢電收音員、並令飭各省市中等畢校及民衆敎育館、分期裝設收昔機、俾全國中等學生及一般民衆、得有普遍接受該項播音之機會、所有播音講師、俱爲學識經騐極富之專家、而所選敎材、也爲極其需要之知識、現該項工作、進行尚稱順利、將來繼續推行、於我國敎育前途、當裨益不少、</p>
<p>上面所談的是過去一年中央敎育行政概况的回顧、至於今後行政的展望、據個人愚見、應注意下列幾點、</p>
<p>高等敎育關於專科以上學校方面、應注重質的方面的改進、而不必斤斤於數的方面的擴充、全國專科以上學校、截至現在止、已有一百一十一校、數量已算不少、今後的中心工作、應該要把原有的學校、在質量上加以改進與充實、至於數量的擴充、如非爲國家及民族建設上所必需者而外、似不必再事大量的擴充、至於質量方面的改進、最要的還是在注重學術研究、並謀中國學術的獨立、中國民族不獨應於政治經濟上求獨立、於學術上亦應求能立足於世界、今後專科以上學校、應謀程度的提高、與專門學術的硏究以建立學術獨立的基礎、同時國家對於硏究及發明應積極獎勵、以資提倡、還有一點、專鬥人材及學術人材、政府固應培植、且亦應盡量的任用、如此才是儲才用才的大道、</p>
<p>普通敎育方面、應以全力推行義務敎育與職業敎育、義敎與職敎的重耍、誰都承認的、並且誰都承認是目前最迫切的需耍、義務敎育的推行、我們在上面已說過了、不過僅是發端而已、我們今後應以全力去推行、去擴張、以建立義敎的基礎、職業敎育爲生產的敎育、在目前允爲重要、我們應積極的設法推廣和充實、</p>
<p>社會敎育方面、今後的中心工作是對於民衆敎育及民衆體育的推廣、應想一種最有效的方法去推行、使民衆在知識方面及體格方面、獲得一種基本的訓練和鍜鍊、</p>
<p>蒙藏敎育過去雖無十分的成績表現、但規劃方面、確實有很好的方案、我們今後應按爭方案、先從邊疆的義務敎育着手、然後逐漸謀中學師範及職業敎育的設施、這樣才可以收到實效、（完）</p>

<p>— Louisa　M.Alcott原著　鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>『他不，但假如他拿了，我的確要衛護他的，他一直待我很好』，乃德說道，說得那麼誠懇，唐恩竟忘了他的蜘蛛，立即要起來去謝他，可是內達接下去又說道：</p>
<p>『我知道是唐恩做的，他把錢給了你。一點也不希奇，假如他在未來以前一直是靠剪綹過活的，這裏也只有你知道他的來歷，』內達故意這麼說，想借此激怒他，使他肯把眞情吐露出來。</p>
<p>他這種壞心腸却有一部分的成功，因爲乃德凶狠狠地喊道：</p>
<p>「假如你再說，我要把一切去告訴裴先生。我本不願搬嘴，可是，假如你要去累到唐恩身上，那我簡直不客氣要去告訴了。」</p>
<p>『那末你不但是賊是謊子，而且是個醜壞』，內達開頭故意這麼嘲笑他，因爲乃德能那麼忍受一切的侮辱，所以內達不相信他敢於爲了唐恩去向老師陳訴的。</p>
<p>我不知道他還有什麼話說，因爲其餘的話還沒出口時，後面一隻畏臂已抓住了他的領子，猛將他拉過牆頭，撲通一聲，摔他在溪流的中間，一時水沫，粉飛叫濺。</p>
<p>『要是你再說，我便要撳你到水裹去，直到你連眼睛都張不開來！』唐恩喊道，看去倒像一個武士的塑像一般，雄糾糾，氣昂昂，兩脚各跨在溪流的一邊，往下直視着那個落水的少年。</p>
<p>「我只是談談笑話，」內達說道。</p>
<p>『你自己是個醜壞，逼得乃德來走頭無路。只要讓我下次再見到你，我便要把你浸到河裏去。起來，滾法罷。』唐恩盛怒說來，聲如雷霆。</p>

<p>在本年上半年中，為我國受外國滙兌降落及銀價提高之影響，外滙開始急劇上漲之時期，五月之高價，已冲銷從前我國外滙因銀價跌落而跌落之程度，而回復民國十八年之常態—即二〇·五二四便士。　十一月三日財政部新貨幣法令之公佈，開我國管理外滙之紀元，今後外滙將有穩定之趨勢。</p>
<p>我國外滙之决定，以倫敦大條價為依據，即以我國每單位貨幣所含純銀若干之定數，乘當日倫敦大條銀價，即將當日應有之對英滙價（對其他各國，則以英為凖，以Crosslate計算之）。然自美國提高銀價以來，我國外滙事實上並未隨銀價之上漲為等量之上漲，故有白銀流出等現象發生，茲比較本年倫敦銀價與我國外滙之情形如次（註四）：（未完）</p>

<p>— （本報徵文第一獎）江蘇江都縣立一區城北小學邱正禧</p>
<p>有人說，中國人所以受外國人壓迫的原因，完全是因爲科學不發達的緣故，這話眞不錯。</p>
<p>現在世界上種種事業，全和科學有關，外國因爲科學發達，實業興盛，所以國富兵强，才能壓迫我們科學落後的弱小民族。我們要反抗强權，恢復自由平等的地位，也只有發達科學，才能夠戰勝他們，所以我將來願意做一個科學家，盡我做國民的責任。</p>
<p>但是我不願意做一個只知發明愴砲毒氣來殘殺人類的科學家，我願意做一個有利於人民社會國家和世界的科學家。</p>
<p>像法國的巴斯德一樣，研究改良本國的農業和蠶桑，使得收穫豐富，品質精良，容易推銷到外國去。</p>
<p>像美國的愛迪生一樣，發明了許多應用電器的機器，做工業的原動力，使得出品價廉物美，可以賺很多的錢。巴斯德使法國富强，愛迪生使美國富强，我也要使中國富强。可是空說是沒有用的，我現在是一個小學生，，我要勞力學習，一天不間斷，要照着下面兩種方法做去：</p>
<p>（一）要隨時隨地努力目學，不完全依賴書本，凡是自然界的一切現象，如寒暑的變化，萬物的生長等，都要一天一天記載下來，做研究的資料。</p>
<p>（二）要從小事情研究起，慢慢研究大的問題，譬如牛頓看見蘋果落地，便知道地心吸力，瓦特看見壺蓋掀翻，便發明了蒸汽機，這都是我應該效法的研究精神。</p>
<p>如若全國的小學生，都能和我同樣的立志，將來我的志願達到，中國也就富强起來了，到那時還怕什麼帝國主義的壓迫呢？</p>

<p>— 眞</p>
<p>在星期日的那一天，敏兒於溫習功課外，閒着無事，要求着他哥哥聰兒和他到熱鬧的都市裏去玩玩，這不是第一次的請求了。所以聰兒便答應了他，於是他們兄弟倆步行到都市裹去了</p>
<p>不多一會，他們已到了目的地，敏兒覺得眞是好玩極了，四面的橱窗裹陳列着五光十色，光怪陸離的東西，害得敏兒來不及細細的瞧了，並且又時時刻刻的問着他的哥哥：這是什麼東西？那東西呌甚麼？而聰兒的心要，在笑着他弟弟的無智識，但也難怪他，他對於這些束西，先前都沒有瞧見過。</p>
<p>漸漸的到了一家菜館的門口，敏兒看見一個人在那自來水龍頭上一旋，於是有潔白的水，很急的流出來。敏兒看得呆住了，便很快的問他哥哥：</p>
<p>「哥哥，你瞧，那自來水龍頭裏怎會有水出來的？」</p>
<p>「那水自從自來水廠來的，廠裹有好多座很大的打水機，能從江裹的水打上很高的藏水的桶裏，有人呌它是水塔，於是水從另外的幾根鐵管而分送到各人的家裹，但是在未送到各人家之前，還有好多步的工作，像什麼消毒哪，化騐哪，先要知道這水是不是淸潔，吾則，容易傳染疾病。」</p>
<p>「水怎會從水塔要下來？」</p>
<p>「這就是利用虹吸管的作用，虹吸管是一個不等畏兩臂的彎管可不必傾倒容器，就可把水從高處移到低處，你想水塔是多麼大，怎可傾倒水塔，只可利用虹吸的作用了。總之水怎會從水塔裏下來？便是靠了空氣的壓力。」</p>
<p>「我不信！」敏兒疑着的說。</p>
<p>「好，到家裏去試給你看。」於是他倆很快的跑到家裹。</p>
<p>聰兒拿了一根橡皮管和兩隻碗，他把一隻碗放在高處，把另一隻碗放在低處，再把管子的兩頭各把在碗裹高的一碗已放了水，於是他把低的一頭管子吸了一下，水便源源不絕的下來了。他便說道：「這就是虹吸管，至於筆套吸水，自來水筆裹的橡皮管，這也是虹吸管，不過是變態的罷了。」</p>

<p>一，前言</p>
<p>日本，在其他方面，爲了「敦睦邦交」的關係，姑具勿論；而在學術界上的確是一個極肯挺進的國家；像漫畫，有孩子的，婦女的，文學的，政治的等等。近兩天我在他們「少年俱樂部新年號附錄」漫畫學校（　名）上　見權井　次郞所作奇說的漫畫之描寫方法，不敢珍秘，因將原圖和原文或臨　，或意總，分別介紹給愛好漫畫的小朋友！</p>
<p>二、漫畫漫摹</p>
<p>三、漫話漫譯</p>
<p>這一頁漫書的特徵，因爲那是大的描寫，所以很有趣味。簡述如次：</p>
<p>你瞧那大的描寫，縱橫裏看，或者是長形，或者是短形，或者大，或者小，或者圓，或者扁圓：從縱裹看，都是差不多的：不是嗎？再進一步，再進一步的特微的樣子，全然有區別了：同時趣味也一層比一層加深了。綜觀全頁，這個漫畫的意味，和那個漫畫的意味，又有分別。</p>

<p>— 康健齋夫</p>
<p>世界究竟有末日麼？</p>
<p>要是地球毀滅，或是太陽失踪，那就一切都完了。</p>
<p>看過瀑布飛泉的，應該知道瀑布從高處奔流而下，有一小部分的水受著日光隨時蒸發到空中，並不是全部降到澗裹去的。據現代的科學家說：太陽在天空中不絕的放散，它的熱力不絕的消失，正似瀑布泉要蒸發去一部分的水量一樣。美國最大的瀑布泉是尼加拉瀑布。太陽每一分鐘要消失它的重量二億五千萬噸；這個重量等於尼加拉瀑布泉的一百五十倍呢。</p>
<p>百年以前，科學家的見解以爲世界上的物質是不生不滅的，永遠是一毫不增，一毫不滅。現在呢，愛因斯坦把這個陳舊的學說打破了。改正了物理學上錯誤的見解。</p>
<p>這樣說起來，太陽不停的放散，便一天天變瘦小了，它究竟還能存在多少年呢？據說因爲它先天豐富，它的體積大得海外，胖子身上拔根汗毛，算不得一回事。它至少還可以存在一百萬萬年。</p>
<p>說到我們住的地球，比起太陽，雖然是又小又冷，它每分鐘也要放散出一盎司的熱量。（不到一兩重。）在一畫夜二十四小時之問，大的要减少八十一斤的重量。但是地球也畢竟是個龐然大物，這些損失也還算不了什麼。</p>
<p>世界的末日還遠著咧，我們怎麼可以不力圖民族的自力生存呢！</p>

<p>— 張惠明</p>
<p>光陰如電般的馳來，剎那間，二十四年又夢也似的過去了；二十五年已跟着來了。</p>
<p>小朋友！大家都知道每年的星期是很複雜的，一時要求某月某日是是期幾，是不是一件很困難的事嗎？雖然去翻日曆，也須經過相當的時間：現在我來替諾位介紹一種—二十五年度—星期猜算法。這種方法，如果學會了，求起星期來又便利，又正確，而且很有興趣，小朋友！我們不妨來照着後面的方法玩玩看！月份一二三四五六七八九十十一十二</p>
<p>數目256247251361</p>
<p>這個方法很簡單，只須把表上各月份的數目紀牢，就可以實行了。</p>
<p>方法：把耍求這月份的數目，加上要求這月份的日子，然後再用七去除，餘下的數目，就是所要求的星期，如果除盡，那便是星期日。醫如要求九月十六日是星期幾？可將猜表中，一的數目加上十六，是十七，再用七去除十七，餘數是三，那麼，這日是星期三。</p>
<p>還有二件事應該注意：一，上面這猜算表內的數，祇可於二十五年變適用，如果過了二十五年，就要另定數目了。二，凡表內的數目與日子加後，在七以內的數目，可不必去用七除，這數便是這日的星期。</p>

<p>有一天，我坐在家裹沒有事；忽然看見桌上有一盒牙扜；我就想起挖耳朵，我就拿了一根挖。忽然一個不留心，挖破了耳朵裏的蓋膜，覺得痛了一痛，就不痛了。我還聽見入家說：到了節氣要發，後來到七日的晚上，耳朵裹痛得很，裏面的膜在震動。過了一二天後：纔覺得好些。</p>

<p>— 心靑</p>
<p>柏德希挨受這種悠久而深刻的苦痛，足足有兩年之久，它總是照常的沿着那崎嶇不平的路，向那羅本城走去。一天是在仲夏的時光，天氣炎熱得很，它拖着的車兒中，高高地堆滿了陶器和金屬的貨物。它的主人在旁邊閒閒地度去，不住的將一根鞭子抽在它那抖顫的腰部。</p>
<p>那惡徒自己隨時在路旁酒店中買啤酒喝，但他却不許柏德希停下脚來喝一口河水。可憐它奔走於烈日下火炎似的路上，已有二十四小時不曾吃過東西了，更難愛的，就是十二小時中沒有喝一滴水，塵沙封住它的眼睛，皮鞭抽在它的身上，更要拉着那重重的一車貨物，使它困苦不堪，有一次便口吐白沫，跌倒在地。</p>
<p>它跌在滿着塵沙的雪白的路中，烈日還是很殘酷地遏灼着它。它一動不動的躱在那裹，分明是快要死的樣子。它的主人一面駡一面踢，更拿了一根梗木做的短棍，向着它的身上亂打，這就算是給與它的唯一的飲食，唯一的酬報。</p>
<p>但是柏德希再也不是咒駡和踢打所能逼得起來的了。它仍是伸直了四肢像死一般的僵臥在路的中心，雪白的塵沙，埋沒了它的半身。</p>
<p>停了一會，那惡徒見它仍然不動，以為它是死定的了。於是惡狠狠的駡了它幾聲，解下了它身上的全副皮帶，用力地把它踢在路旁的草堆裏，他還是滿口子的咒駡不休，自己拉了那車兒慢吞吞地走上小山去，讓那可憐的狗躺在草堆裹，給螞蟻去咬，給烏鴉去啄。</p>
<p>這天，是羅凡地方大節日的末一天，所以那惡徒急着要趕到那邊的市集上去，可以揀選一個良好的地位，陳列他的貨物。</p>
<p>這一回，他實在是氣憤極了，因爲柏德希本是一頭强健而很有忍耐力的狗。拉車是它的專職，不料如今却要它拉着這車兒，一路趕往羅凡去。他氣憤之餘，再也不想仔細的〇一〇柏德希，他以爲它勢在必死，沒有甚麼用了。以後他儘可再去偷一頭大狗代替柏德希的職務，在他本身並沒有多大的損失，而對於柏德希過去兩年間的勞績，再也不放在心上了。</p>
<p>那惡徒已去遠了。而柏德希仍是躺在那路旁的草堆裏。</p>
<p>這一天，是路上很忙的日子，千百的人，有的步行，有的騎着驢子，有的趕着貨車，又快樂又忽忙，向羅凡進發，有的對它瞧瞧，有的並不注意，都一一走了過去。可是有一頭狗的死活，和他們有甚麼相干呢？</p>
<p>不多一會，在那許多行人之中，來了一個小老頭兒，傴腰跛脚而又弱衰得很，他身上的衣服甚是破爛，處處表現他的窮苦，只是一蹺一拐的，在塵沙中慢慢地走去。</p>

<p>— 馮善樑醫生</p>
<p>淋病的治療方法夥矣，如電療，注射，洗射，內服等，中除電療法外，注射，洗射及內服三者，都可謂之藥物治療，至於注射，晚近所倡導者，胥色素及混合淋苗，色素中之優良者，如「安抵雪淸」及「脫呂派弗拉文」是，混合淋苗中之最和平穩妥而奏免疫之效者，如法製之「乃啞德梅共」，洗射，向所採用者，大都為蛋白銀製劑之殺菌液，乃者所用，則亦根據免疫療淋之原理，行淋病血淸局部注入收效之能事，此項現成製劑中之最適妥者，莫「淋毒舒藥耳」若，出品種類之最多者，試看報章廣吿，已覺美不勝收，大別之，要凡含有濃重之收斂成分者為不取，因是類藥品，雖服後瞬見大效，然往往因極度收斂故，反使醫生診斷摸糊，而病菌得深潛粘膜之中，俟機再發，實為病根，所以淋病內服藥，須求富於滲透力殺菌力者為上，俾得深入而奏滅菌之效。如近今之「滅殺淋」然。</p>
<h3 id="c195">淋病穩妥治療之我見 <a href="#c195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— 佘雷醫師</p>
<p>人體被淋菌感染後，始初發現，胥在尿道，是以淋病之治療，未可忽略局部處置也，但因淋菌潛伏在尿道粘膜縐襞之中，僅行局所殺菌之未足全恃，是以淋病的治療，須兼行全身療法，近今獎賞之行電機療法，如短波透熱電乃利用其熱力及電力以撲殺淋菌，如最新療濁機乃以該機之光力以殺菌，如是相並施行，可謂歷不獲愈，至少可說是淋病的完全治療。從前局部療淋法，大凡施用蛋白銀製劑，其收效之不完全，固不待說，自「淋毒舒樂耳」及「血立伐耳」出，於焉爭相購用，其價値可知，全身療法中，在免疫上昔以單純的伐克辛，現以混合的白濁漿苗，功效之高下，可毋待卜，他如內服療法，從前是「檀香油」，「哥派巴」等之製劑，現在如「滅殺淋」等之濃重殺菌力而無絲亳之收斂成分之專製之藥物。此外如淋毒性疾患，由淋病原因而來之疾患，如睪丸炎，關節炎等，治療上雖須追原因而施以原因的治療，然藥物的施與，據個人經騐，砒素實為不可缺少之一。</p>

<p>張君年廿四歲，自訴昔年曾犯手淫惡習，今已戒絕，惟夢遺滑精，已歷二三年矣，症狀，夜睡多夢，遺精約數日一次，有時逐日一次，一夜兩次者，遺精後翌朝，則頭重頭暈，精神倦怠，治療，予以「安爾神」之內服，先後凡三盒，所病若失，</p>
<p>陸君年卅二歲，身體素弱，者年染有阿芙蓉癖，戒絕已三年餘，惟年來頻頻夢遺，甚或無夢滑精，曾數度延醫，奈總鮮確效，今春購服陳藥，亦無效騐，經金君之介，始就診於余，復因遠處鄕間，未便作久時之診療，爰卽命其購「安爾神」片內服，迄今二月餘，不但病已霍然，卽精神飽滿，遠勝疇昔。</p>
<h3 id="c197">論割包皮 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 崔馥卿醫師</p>
<p>陰莖包皮過長之病，很普遍，其必需割除者，若包皮過緊而龜頭未得突露者，或包皮過長龜頭全被遮掩者，則有積垢納污，易至包皮及龜頭之炎症，且有妨礙生育之處，理應割除，他如包皮稍長，依然能突露上番者，似無須割治，行是項手術時，僅行局部麻醉已足，從前有主張將陰莖根部結摯，麻醉液之注入，亦陰莖根部為主者，不知結摯陰莖根部，反使有事後出血之虞，即麻醉液之注射，亦僅須於包皮及龜頭溝處已足，陰莖根部等處，似無須續行注入也，剪法自以種類甚多如三角切開法或用V氏之切除法及環狀切除法，視陰莖形，而行手術，皮內之脂內層，不可剪削，因恐內層動壓被割斷縮却後，旣難以找尋，又恐出血不止，如內部血管旣被剪斷，則應立即結摯，縫合時須細密對稱，包摯時須行壓迫繃帶，然後以丁字帶捉舉之，如是旣無割後流血，又無其他無妄之痛苦。</p>

<p>靑年男女，在十五六歲至廿五六歲，卽在發育之時期，往往患本症，本症俗稱粉刺，顏面發生之地位，通常為面頰，顴額及鼻部等處，形如帽針頭之黑點，如用力擠之，則見有細長或小粒之灰色脂肪性物，自由排出，此乃為皮脂皮屑塵垢之混合物，本症乃由皮脂分泌障碍而來明矣，面皰的底層，有發生痤瘡之小結節者，亦有數個面皰，相互通連，形成粗萦纍之面皰者，治療本症的藥物如鋅養，硼酸，水楊酸等物均可，惟須將皰中雜質擠出，净洗後塗之，「滅絕菌」為皮膚治療劑中之聖品，除含有極優良之滅疥等皮膚良藥外，對於鋅養硼酸水楊酸等藥，罔不俱備，用以作面皰之治療，無不收藥到病除之功。</p>

<h3 id="c202">論今日的烟禁 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 世雄</p>
<p>淸代末季，英國利用優越的軍艦大砲作掩護，將多量的雅片輸入我國，以謀根本消滅我民族的生機，迨雅片戰爭結果，更開不平等條約的先河而淪我國於次殖民地的地位。昔林文忠公有言曰：「……此禍不餘，十年之後，無可用之兵，無可籌之餉。……雅片流毒內地，如癰疽流毒人身；癰疽生則漸以成膿，雅片來則漸以致寇。……」慨乎斯言！凡先覺者均已認拒毒為內政上當務之急，中山先生拒毒遺訓也說：「中國之民意未有不反對雅片，茍有主張法律准許雅片營業，或對雅片之惡勢力表示降服者，均為民意之公敵。」「對雅片之宣戰絕對不可妥恊，茍負責之政府機關為自身之私，便對雅片下旗息戰，不問久暫，均屬賣國之行為。」這些拒毒的主張尤為堅毅而具體。</p>
<p>但歷來拒毒和禁烟的工作往往時作時輟，鮮有成效。考其原因，不外：一，軍閥竊據，相爭於內，軍糧剝削於民，於是橫微暴斂，勒種烟苗，飲鴆止渴，以收漁利。第二是歷來的執政者雖也知黑禍的罪惡，然因國庫如洗，而軍餉浩繁，乃不得不假「寓禁於徵」之名，實行雅片公賣之實。民國肇始以來，實行禁烟何止一次？且初辦時往往雷厲風行，可是到了中途終至解禁，以致不但成績亳無，而毒禍的蔓延反與日俱增。試觀二十多歲的靑年，新吸者之數量的加多，卽可見其一班？</p>
<p>最近，據報載，五省烟民早經登記，限期戒絕，以後如遇有新吸或重吸，卽以軍法處分。至於上海這地方，因為五方雜處，且有租界為之屏障，向為藏垢納污的所在，實施烟禁也為最難。但據報載，上海烟民登記也已經截止，嗣後只須觀其方法與收效如何了。</p>
<p>為使此次烟禁不致再蹈已往覆轍起見，我們希望禁烟當局注意以下三點：一，主持烟禁的分子須絕對以身作則　「以身作則」四字雖為一切為政者的條件，而對於負烟禁之責的人尤為重要。所以主持烟禁諸分子，本身須絕無嗜好，然後方能令出法行，而無畏葸退縮之弊。更不可藉此作肥己的工具，俾免烟民之嘖有煩言。</p>
<p>二，罰金絕無能使烟民除癮的效果　前見蘇省各縣，烟民的登記費，除赤貧徵每季六角外，餘均大洋六元。這一筆區區欵項，在當局雖可挪作禁烟行政之用，而在百業凋敝下的小民實為無上的負担。又，以前捉到烟民，常不使戒絕烟癮，僅以罰金了事，這尤為烟禁失败之原。蓋烟禁目的重在使之戒絕烟癮，故决無可以巨量登記費或罰金使烟民去除烟癮者。而况富戶烟民根本不愁無錢，有錢卽仍可安然抽吸，這對於烟禁行政的目的尤相逕庭。</p>
<p>三，應規定最短期限後絕對斷絕土膏毒物的來源　土膏行的准許暫行設立，公開營業，其目的是為便利舊烟民的戒絕。烟民旣有戒絕的定期，烟行也應當隨之撤消，並且應從根本上斷絕土膏及其他毒物的來源。來源旣絕，則已戒絕的可不致重吸，未吸的不致有新癮，這實是治本之圖，釜底抽薪的辦法。然茲事體大，海關應如何査緝烟土及其他毒物？租界上應如何使之不為藏毒的所在？諸如此類，政府茍無正本淸源的决心，不以整個政治力和外交方略促成之，則勢必功敗垂成，而使今日的烟禁前途殊少樂觀成分的！</p>

<h3 id="c203">世界各國的國會議事室 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 似若</p>
<p>英國的國會　在倫敦太晤士河畔有一所高矗雲霄的華麗的洋房，那便是英國的上下院。這個建築是在十一世紀中，由安古羅·沙姆孫王家的最後的英王愛特華特·扎·昆庫梭爾開始修築的。後來又迭次增修，才漸漸成為了極偉觀的建築。但在英國產業革命前，更確切一點說，是在英國君主立憲政治未產生之前，這個建築還是作為宗敎的參拜處所的；它之成為英國國會會所是在君主立憲政治在大不列顚帝國成立之後的事情。</p>
<p>英國國會曾遭幾次焚燒：其中以一八三四年的大火最為厲害，損失當然也最大。但在一八三五年英政府又設計重修，結果費去了七十二萬四千九百八十六磅的巨欵，修成了更偉大更華麗的世界規模最大的國會會所。這個新建的國會當然仍分上下兩院。下院的議長席是在北端；在議長席的前面是書記官席；塲中徧佈着暗綠色的摩洛哥皮的椅子，那便是國會議員們的座位。上院較下院更為可觀，大英帝國歷代帝王的肖像與許多大政治家的大理石的或銅的彫像，都是陳列在這里的；在它的北端有高達三百十八英尺的大塔，極為偉觀；在塔的頂上還有一架大鐘，直徑有二十三英尺，重十三噸，這恐怕要算是世界上最大的鐘了。</p>
<p>美國的Capitol在規模的宏大上僅次於英國國會的，是美國的議事室。</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>美國議會是由華盛頓大總統建築的，內分元老院和代議院（下院）二院。元老院是由四十八州的議會各選出兩名議員，共九十六名議員組成的，其職務是立法。至於代議院，則是在一七八九年由六十五名議員開始組成的。這兩院的議事室位置在華盛頓離坡多馬克河水面八十八英尺的高地。它的西面臨坡馬克河，南面可以俯視亞基可斯加河，是美國首都第一等名勝之。地它在建築上的樣式是古典式的，計有四層之高。</p>
<p>和英國國會一樣，美國的議事室也會遭幾次火災。在一八一五年，政府曾募集五十萬美金的公債，實行改修。至一八一八年時，中央部分即告竣工，下院的工事才算完成：到了一八二七年，議事室的全部也就完工了。但在一八五一年又遭火災，其後又增修，及至一八六一年才完成了像現在這樣美觀的形式。它的南北計長七百五十餘英尺，東西約三百五十英尺，面積共有六個四千二百五十英尺。上院寬五十一英尺，長八十四英尺，天井高三十六英尺。議員席是以演講台為中心，配置成為半圓形；在議場之上的周圍有回廊，那是傍聽席。下院的佈置也很漂亮，在那里可以看到靑銅製的自由神的立像。</p>
<p>德國的議事室　德國的議會是由國參議院和國議會組成的，但這兩者的關係並非普通上院和下院的關係；參議院是代表德意志聯邦的，國會則是代表德國國民的，這可說是德國國會的獨特之點。</p>
<p>德國國會的議事室是在柏林市太爾加爾吞的中央公園之旁，那里有大凱旋紀念柱，有帝室阿拍拉劇場，噴水塔，俾斯麥的銅像等建築物。但是，由於德國的黨爭，德國國會不知道究竟是被那一派縱火災燬了，現在還未修復。</p>
<p>此外，德國還有普魯士的議事室，需要在此談談。這個議事室是在一九〇四年修成的，接鄰着商務和陸軍兩部的所在地，這個議事室的建築也分上下兩院，共四層。上院地基佔六四八〇平方尺，下院地基是六個二千三百九十平方尺。上院議場是正方形，寬約六十四尺，深約六十尺，天井高三十六尺。下院議事室是矩形，共有四百三十三議員席，配置為半圓形；傍聽席是在議場上面的周轉；西面的中央是皇室席，北面是公眾席。可是，現在德國和普魯士已沒有議會制度的存在了，因之這議事室也不過是一種建築形式，不能有什麽特別意義的。</p>
<p>法國的議事室　如在畫家達經特所描寫的「柯德之誓」中所見到的一樣，法國的議事室從開始就不是特別為當作議事所而建築的。法國的元老院，即上院，是巴黎魯克桑布爾爵宮，代議院則是布爾本舊宮殿。前者是從一六一五年到一六二〇年，由布爾本王家的始祖恩里四世的皇后瑪利·德·美姬建築的；路易·斐列普在從一八三〇年到一八四八年的在位中又加以增修，及至一八七五年共和政治復活後，才將其一部分改造成為上院議事室；那時其他一部分還是博物院，這是在一八九〇年才改充議事室之用的。這個議事室共有三層，議場是半圓形，共有三百二十位的議員席。至於後者——布爾本宮殿，乃是由意大利建築家基拉尼設計，在一七二二的動工建成的。以後是國民會議議場，再後來才用為下院的議事室，以至於今。它是在塞魯河畔，共有議員席六百零二位。這上下兩院都是半圓形，現今法國的一切政爭都在這半圓形的議事室中尖銳地表現着。</p>
<p>瑞士的議事室　瑞士是由二十二州合成的聯邦，它的聯邦議會是在各州議會之上。也分上下兩院，上院是各州代表，下院是由國民選出的代議機關。各州議會都採用一院制。瑞士的全體行政即是由聯邦議會提出七人為委員處理之，其任期為三年。</p>
<p>聯邦的新議室在伯倫市彭德士街，是五層高的意大利文藝復興式的建築，外面用伯倫產的莫拉士石砌成，極為美觀。這個議事室是世界議事室中少有的大矩形的缺圓形，在音樂的效果上是很好的。從這里可以望見阿爾卑斯山和瑞士的許多自然美景，所以亦可算得名勝之地。</p>
<p>奧匈的議院　在戰前奧匈是合為一國的，合稱奧匈帝國。戰後分而為二，其政治當然也就各自獨立了。所以，現在我們對奧匈的議事室必須分別說明。</p>
<p>奧大利的議會建築是希臘式，也分成上下兩院。下院在右，上院在左。在上院的門前有大理石的神像，有大的噴水池，兩旁還有鋼鐵製的大旗竿。上二百零八席議員席，下院的議員席則是六百十六席。說到裝飾，那是不能說是很漂亮的。</p>
<p>匈牙利的議事室原來是國立博物館，在一八八六年才實行設計改建為議事室，結果費了十八年的時間，九百五十六萬五十三甫羅林的資金，才完成了這個壯麗的建築物。它是五層高的大建築，不僅外觀很華麗，就是裏面也很優雅；它的室內的四壁都是用大理石裝置的。</p>
<p>此外，世界其他各國也都有議事室，但因在建築上都不怎樣出色，所以在這裏也不再一一講述了。</p>

<h3 id="c204">湯山巡禮 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 許文</p>
<p>我前後在南京住了二年，近兩年內又不時跑到那兒去躭擱幾天，但是呢，却未到那有名的湯山去過。有些時當然是因為機會不巧：事多，天氣不好，沒興緻，再不然就是缺乏法幣。但是我又何嘗不去厭了玄武湖，雨花台，淸凉山，明孝陵和靈谷寺呢？所以說，不去湯山的最大原因！還是我害怕：誰個不知道湯山是名人們的憩息所？我是甚麽人？不要妄想去享受那有名的硫磺泉罷。所以我腦海中的湯山是美麗的，豪華的，是人間的天堂，是適宜的憩息所。但是我在這個冬天，不知怎的竟僥倖地到了湯山。</p>
<p>我們是三個人，像每個旅行者一樣，薄明便起身。七點鐘趁汽車出發，出中山門，沿那美麗的陵園路走了一節，便分道，一直向湯山開去。馬路是沿山坡修的，遠看去，像一條窄帶子。我們的車子也時而在坡上，時而在低谷中。剛剛過了一個鐘頭，便到了湯山。原來這兒離南京祗五十里。</p>
<p>在那　　通到句容與杭州的馬路右邊。它的對面便是公園。看一看，那預先約好作嚮導的朋友却沒來。我們三人都是第一次到這裏來，怎辦？於是只得再沿馬路前行五里，在那建築得很壯偉的某學校中把他找來。我開頭便向他說：「看樣子，湯山的好處恐怕不易見罷；倒是這座學校還雄大巍巍。不要是參觀學校才好呢！」</p>
<p>「正是如此，」我那朋友笑了一笑，「這學校已經是化了二百五十萬的建築費了，你看看，進大門的馬路還沒修好，誰說値不得你參觀？但是你參觀了湯山後再說。」</p>
<p>湯山並不是一座山，正如你所有南京的郊外一般，只是一些左右前後蜿蜒起伏不定的土阜而已。</p>
<p>我們隨着我們的嚮導，踱過一架小而窳敗的木橋。橋下面是一灣非常齷齪的死水，我看見一個洗便桶的女子和一個淘菜的老年婦人，在這同一水　裏工作着。而在岸邊，在這木橋頭，有兩個憲兵和警士正在踱着方步。</p>
<p>過橋，左轉彎，不上十步，陶園便在右手邊，這便是那著名的溫泉浴室附近也　　　　　　和旅舍，這都是在大都市中所尋不到的。陶園外面疏疏地有幾輛汽車，看上去像是非常荒凉的樣子。</p>
<p>陶園和那些旅舍餡餅都是傍着那小小的士阜——湯山而建築的。我們走進去，便有茶房招呼我們至休室。這兒倒不錯，有地毯，有棹布，有火爐，有雨前和雀舌，有咖啡和牛奶，有土司，也有冰淇淋。還有分隔開的小房間，那裏面的裝飾更加華麗，我看見一張紫紅色的天鵝絨檯布，而所有的沙發又是在絲絨上面繍着金綫的。就在這樣的小房間裏，走出一對靑年男女來。男的佩着證章，女的抱着熱水袋。我的嚮導朋友向我說：「看罷，這女子是秦淮河的　　，這男子，看證章是　　部的…」</p>
<p>「這能夠嗎？」我驚異了，「在南京這地方，公務人員能夠嗎？何况在湯山，他很容易碰到他的長官的。」</p>
<p>「你眞太傻了！」我的朋友很有把握地笑了，「現在高級的長官們很少來這裏洗澡了。你看那邊，」他把我引出屋子，用手指着離這兒不遠的一座大　　　　　　　　　　的別墅；這邊，是……現在長官們都往那裏洗澡去了。」</p>
<p>自然，我們都去洗溫泉了。浴室是一種小小的平房，壞而且舊。裏面是各自分開的小房間。走進去，水蒸氣便向臉上撲，那一陣悶熱的味道眞像進了土耳其式的蒸氣浴室。</p>
<p>澡塘是花崗石建築的，是一種見方的，幾乎是游泳池的樣子——我說游泳池，是比方它的大小，眞的，像我們這種人雖然不能游泳，但像小孩子那麽大的體積，一定能在這兒游得開的。我從石級上走了下去，看一看，這池子幾乎也有像游泳池那樣的深。</p>
<p>水太熱了，硫磺味又太重。我尋找龍頭，發現一個——僅有一個非常大的，裝在游泳池的頂頭。我試放一放，却是一樣沸熱的水。沒有冷水，怎麽辦呢？我便靜坐在石級上等候着，等候這水的溫度漸漸的，慢慢的减低……</p>
<p>過後嚮導吿訴我：「這不比北平的溫泉，更比不得四川重慶的北碚溫泉。不要說這兒的水源沒有那兩處大，溫度也沒有那兩處適宜。」他想了一想又加上說：「聽說呢，因為這兒水源不大，所以他們便在夜裏和平時把泉水儲蓄起來，要用時再用火燒一燒。再說，在這兒洗澡總覺太貴些，也太俗些。一個人洗一次澡，連茶連小費得二元多。北平却只要五毛多，重慶更便宜，只要一毛多，有時還可以免費。」</p>
<p>我們都失望地走了出來。沒有山，沒有水，沒有建築，沒有風景，怎麽能稱湯山？又怎麽能這麽著名？</p>
<p>我很想到對面公園中去走走，以為可以補償我們的失望。但是我的嚮導又說了：「說遊公園不如說望公園罷！你只要在門口望一望就得了。看，就是這個：從門口起，一條直的細沙路，兩邊是梧桐，剪秋蘿。走完公園，還是條直路，梧桐，剪秋蘿。你要不要去研究梧桐和剪秋蘿呢？」</p>
<p>我們都苦笑了，便拖着我們的嚮導同返南京。汽車沿着大路疾馳，我們都很頹喪，低着頭，不說一句話，只是嚮導還很有意思地儘笑着。忽然，我的同伴之一說了：「南京所有名勝地方都是非常著名的，但是你只可以知道，切不要去看，一定，切不要去……」</p>

<h3 id="c205">怎樣鍜鍊自己的言行 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 證誼</p>
<p>思想，言論，行為，這是人的生命活動之三個主要的過程，也可以說由這三者構成了人的生命活動的總的過程。可是思想是未公表的語言，它僅僅是自己在頭腦中的說話，因此它對於自己和社會的生活，只要是它尚未發展到言行的階段，便尚不發生若何影響。然而言語與行為則不然，因為它們是公表了的人的活動，所以它們的影響所及，就必然不可避免地會對社會和自己的生活發生影響，也可以說它們都要對自己和社會直接負責，我們對它們是不能不特別審愼而求其正確的。因為如此，所以　　鍜鍊自己的言論和行為　　成為　　　所必須努力的事體了。</p>
<p>但是，我們應該怎樣鍜鍊我們自己的言行呢？這裏且大槪舉幾點主要的條件來說一說。</p>
<p>每一個人對於自己的言論和行為，當然首先是要求其能夠正確和妥當。但如何才能使言論和行為可以達到正確和妥當的地步呢？這自然是以建立自己的正確的宇宙觀和人生觀為最基本的條件，從正確的理論的充實上來豎立我們的言論和行為的正當標識，作為我們在茫茫大海中航行的指南，並以此來充實它的內容。這個條件雖然很重要，但其理由却非常簡單。因爲思想　　　　　　　　於</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>，但一個人的言行都要受他的思想的領導，照他所思想的去說和行，這是當然的。旣然如此，那麽，要有正確的言論和行為，就非得先在思想上有正確的宇宙觀和人生觀，有正確的理論不可。依據歪曲的理論被公表出來成為議論和行為時，則其言行仍然是歪曲的，這與歪曲的言論和行為所賭思想理論自然也是歪曲的，都是同樣的現實的邏輯之必然。因為如此，所以一個人如果要想使自己的說話和處事都不發生錯誤，那麽努力於基本的理論的研究，特別是最新的哲學與社會科學之研究，就有了必要。因為那裏面可以給你以正確的宇宙觀和人生觀，可以交給你以正確的理論的緣故。沒有理論不但不會有正確的行動，沒有理論就連正確的有內容的話也是說不出來的。根據這點，我們可以回答說，如果你願意把你的言行鍜鍊好，那麽新的理論的研究是必要的。</p>
<p>理論自然重要，但要把我們的言行鍜鍊正確，尚必要有豐富的生活經騐。不曾嘗試過學習泅水的生活經騐。經騐不但足以證騐理論之正確與否，而且它可以發展認識，把認識導向新的階段發展下去。經騐就是生活內容的充實，必須要有生活經騐我們說出來的話才有內容，才能言之成理有物。也要有經騐才能使我們的行為少犯錯誤，且更有力些，因為豐富的生活經騐能减少我們在行動中發生猶豫與長却的心理，使行為果敢堅决起來。如此，則我們如果要想把我們的言行鍜鍊好，那麽多多去經騐實際生活，這是很必要的。而經騐也就是行動的實踐，所以努力於實踐同努力於理論的研究一樣，是會使我們的說話和行動日益進步的。</p>
<p>其次是應當注意我們的言論與行為的適當調整問題。所謂言行間的適當調整，最重要的就是要廢除我們的言論和行為間的絕對矛盾，使它們能夠一致。在現社會裏，可以說幾乎是大多數人都是言不顧行的。他們往往是口裏那樣說了，而在行為時並不照他所說過的話去實踐，口頭說的本是這樣，本是這件事情，而他所行的却是那樣，却是別樣的事情，甚至他的言論恰恰和他的行為相反，自己互相反對。有許多政治家就是這樣，在他們談話或演說時，他們的話是說得冠冕堂皇大公無私的，他們口口聲聲都在說是為社會和大眾，但實際上他們的行為却不是那樣，只是為了自己或自己的社會層的私利。如像某國，當它發動侵略弱小民族的戰爭時，那些政客，軍閥，財閥們都對他們的民眾說，這是為了他們的民族，國家，乃至勞苦大眾而如此這般的，但實際上不過是只為了少數財閥的利益才發動了這種戰爭。並且侵略的結果，民眾不但沒有絲毫利益的獲得，却是軍費負担的加重和到戰塲上去當砲灰。又如墨索里尼侵略阿比西尼亞，也是同樣的戲法的表演，就是例證。由此可知現社會裏的人大多數都是言行相否定和矛盾的，我們要鍜鍊我們的言行時，一定要隨時注意我們的言論和行為的一致，如何說了就得如何做，我們所做的事也應當照我們所說過的去做，不要只在言論上說大話，發出一些欺世的，不兌現的言論，却在行為上自己打自己的嘴。這種言行的一致，絕不只是個人的誠實的私德問題，而是政治的和社會的道德所需要，所以對於言行的訓練，注意把它們鍜鍊得互相一致，不相矛盾，這也是必要的。固然，我們不是說在任何情形下這種言行都得絕對一致，都得不互相矛盾，比如對於你的敵人是不當處處都要誠信，正如醫生對於病人不要吿訴他藥是苦的，病不會好等等一樣，但你的言論和行為如果在社會的大眾的利益要求上不需要矛盾時，是絕對不應使它們陷於矛盾的。</p>
<p>要鍜鍊我們的言行，不但是要使言論和行為間能夠互相調整，而且還應使言論和行為能和環境相調整。這就是說在我們說話與處事時應該注意時間和空間的變換，注意環境的推移，在甚麽時候·對甚麽人·是甚麽環境·應該說些甚麽話·做些甚麽事情·都是要切實加以注意的。時空環境改變了，那麽你的言論和行為也得隨着改變，使之與它們相適應，這樣才能使你的言行處處是妥當適宜的，不至和對象相忤逆，和時代相背反，和環境相枘　。關於這一點，看來似乎是很平常的，但是社會上的人可以說很少人能做到這點，大多數人都是不會看淸人的對象去發言行事，更不會審度環境·時空·在甚麽時間·地方·情形下說甚麽話，做怎樣的事的，所以他們的言行，小之則成為不合時宜，分際的，大之則為違反時代與潮流的言行。因為如此，所以我們應該注意自己的言行，隨時嚴格地鍜鍊自己的言行，要使它們能不相矛盾，使它們能和環境相調整，使它們不至成為失分際的甚至和時代相背逆的言行</p>
<p>末了，在言行的技術上的鍜鍊也是必要的。比如如何把我的理論用簡明扼要的言詞表現出來，在表白我的談話中的中心意思與重要點時，應該用怎樣高低不同的聲調或緩急懸殊的語式等等去表白它，這就是大演說家所常注意的問題。在行為上亦復如此，因為對象和環境的不同，也有時有猛進與綏進之分，也應依於環境的需要而分別採用迂回曲折的行徑，或採取直接行動的形式等等。自然，這些雖都是技術問題，並沒有上述的從基本的理論原則上去注意鍜鍊我們的言行那樣重要，但這也是必要的，我們也應隨時在這些技術上加以注意，用以鍜鍊我們的言行，這樣才能使我們成為一個完善的言論家和行動家，使我們的言行完美。</p>
<p>世界珍聞</p>
<p>— 達</p>
<p>賣夫</p>
<p>在我們貴國，丈夫賣老婆是常有的事，不過，婦人出賣丈夫的事，中國人總很少聽到說過的罷！但信不信由你，最近美國就有一位女人公開售賣他的丈夫。這位女人呌做甫勒特。可德絲夫人，她住在紐約。據說是因為她要回到愛爾蘭去，需要很多的旅費，所以才妙想天開地出售其丈夫。她所討的賣價說來也不算多，但也不能說很少，是一千五百美圓！在她售賣丈夫的時候，還公開表示，誰能給與一千五百美圓，她就將她所有的對她丈夫的權利全部出讓。</p>
<p>毒蛇逃亡</p>
<p>在支加哥郊外的一個動物園里，有十九條毒蛇從檻內逃亡了出來。其中有三條是埃及產的有毒蛇，被它咬傷的人便要卽刻死去。所以，這件事情發生後，在動物園內外都發生了大的騷動。結果是有一條蛇咬傷了個外人，又有一條蛇捕去了一個小孩；至於逃出去的那些蛇，在警察的帮助搜索之下都找到了，只有兩條大砂蛇還未尋得。因為這件事情的發生，動物園中那個管蛇的婦人便被解雇了。這位被解雇的婦人說道：</p>
<p>「不想我犯了不注意的罪。我掃除蛇籠後忘記了關門，只是忘記了。我不能同時做各種事情。現在，砂蛇也許潛居在水管中吧，但它决不是有毒的。現在，砂蛇在最良好的塲所中棲息着。如果世人有蛇一半的好心腸，那世界已經平靜了吧。」</p>
<p>有人說，這婦人很痴愚，她說的是蠢話，你看對不對？</p>
<p>娼妓的組織</p>
<p>有一天晚上，在墨西哥市的紅燈街，行人們沒有看到妓女，都很詫異。但據第二天的報紙所載，說是那些賣笑的女人在那天夜裏開會去了。據說她們共有四百人，在開會時還大演其說，結果還選舉職員，並發表宣言書，表示如不容許她們的要求，卽實行同盟罷工。在她們的宣言書中說：</p>
<p>「我們受房東，檢疫醫生及警官的利用，同樣也為衣服店找錢。我們已經沒有更生的希望了。…政府已經承認了我們為自己利益組織起來，我們不得不結成堅守我們的主義的眞正組織。」</p>
<p>這個組織名呌SPM，在它成立後並决議實行八小時「工作」制。</p>
<p>特赦的理由</p>
<p>總計有一百五十一名的囚犯，突然從紐約的監獄中釋放了。這些囚犯都是外國人，其中以意大利人為最多，佔六十二名。他們所犯的罪或是販賣毒品，或是欺詐，或是偷盜，甚或是殺人。　官塲宣佈所以特赦他們的理由，乃是在大總統的慈悲心下，想使他們回到各自的祖國，依自己的才能去從事正當的職業。但據可靠消息，這上特赦的理由，未必如官塲的說明，實際上倒是以减少監獄的經費為目的的。</p>
<p>事實上如果把這一百五十一名外國囚犯收在監獄里，每人每天卽要消費九十五　，總計一年就需要五萬二千美圓。現在美國政府在節省政策之下為了要每年减少五萬二千美圓的開支，所以才特赦了這一百五十一名囚犯。假使美國政府的節省政策與美國的經濟危機和財政困難有關，那麽，這一百五十一名被特赦了的囚犯是當特別感謝經濟危機和財政困難的吧。</p>

<h3 id="c206">特種跑街 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— 則驤</p>
<p>市面愈是不景氣，做生意的方法也愈多。從前一般商店雇用「跑街」，其目的僅祗限於兜攬同業間的交易；但近來因為彼此間的競爭愈形劇烈，於是，一種所謂「特種跑街」的人物便常在我們的眼前出現了。</p>
<p>這種「特種跑街」的生活，說起來的確頗堪玩味，也可說這還是在東方的紐約的上海才有的一種新興職業。起初從事於這種職業的人並不多，他們所展佈的足跡也並不廣，所以還沒有引起人們怎樣的注意；可是現在就不然了，我們無論在電車上，馬路上，甚至於坐在家裏，都能見到他們的踪跡，無疑地，他們是已經在這生活龐雜的上海社會裏以另一種姿態開闢了新的生活途徑了。</p>
<p>「特種跑街」又名推銷員，最初出現的祗是一般大藥房裏利用他們來推銷「仁丹」，當時人數並不多，所以一般失業的朋友們對這種職業並不感到怎樣大的興趣；可是一般利用「特種跑街」的大藥房，却獲得了推銷上的成功，因此，後來一般有獨特出品的大商店和百貨公司便也紛紛效尤，利用起這種「特種跑街」來了。據我們日常所遇到的「特種跑街」，大槪不下三四十家，如先施，永安，冠生園，泰康，中華工業社，中國國貨公司等，大都有這種長期僱用的「特種跑街」，有時創製了新奇的出品，還得臨時添用的。</p>
<p>「特種跑街」現在已形成了一種職業，這在前面已經說過了；但在同一名稱之下，却又有臨時跑街與長期跑街，及拆賬跑街與包銷跑街各種區別。臨時跑街大都是祗有短期間的工作，所推銷的貨物也僅限於一二種新出品；等到這種新出品被推銷到風行起來時，他們也就同時宣吿失業了。長期跑街則比較「寫意」，他們的僱用時期大都較長，像公司裏面的職員一樣，以一年為服務的最短期限，經常的負着推銷的現任　不管是新出品或已有的出品，祗要一到需要推銷時，便得帶這種出品到外面去推銷。拆賬跑街的性質和前面兩種跑街又稍有不同；這種跑街的工作的久暫頗不一定，因為他們並不向公司支薪。至於包銷跑街，那是還得花點小小資本才能幹的一種工作；這種跑街和出品的公司的關係，彷彿和一個小販與商行的關係差不多，自己帶了錢向公司取貨，批了去再向外推銷。但有時也可向公司裏挪賬，把貨賣掉了再還欵，不過這種令人辦法，須得個人對這公司有了信用或是有殷實的店家担保，才可以辦到的。</p>
<p>現在當這「特種跑街」的，據說有好幾百人，男女都有；但大多數還是一些從前曾當過舊式跑街或從事小本經營的商人，新進的份子却並不多見。做這種「跑街」應具備的條件是：第一要善於辭令，把一件並不怎麽好的貨物要說成「天上有，地下無」那麽高貴。其次，臉皮要「老」，見了生人或熟識的人，態度要一如平常；到了一個帬眾集合的塲所，不問其人數有多少，到了該開口宣傳時，就得毫無顧忌地高聲朗誦起來，大做其推銷工作。</p>
<p>至於他們所得的生活上的待遇，一個臨時跑街每月的薪水大約不過二三十元，間或有超過此數的，但每月四元的電車長期票資却得在收入之內提出來。長期跑街的車資多數是由公司發給，但薪水却沒有臨時跑街那麽多；照一般的情形來說，一個長期跑街的薪水最多不過二十元左右。拆賬跑街，車費也是自理；每月收入的多少須看推銷的成績的好壞而定，簡單的說，就是一種「佣金」制；不過有的公司比較客氣，對於車資也肯津貼一部份的。至於包銷跑街的情形，那就大不相同了；他是拿資本做生意，在工作方面可以不受任何限制，但每月收入的多寡也要看推銷的成績如何而定的。大槪一個包銷跑街每月的進賬總不至在二十元以下。此外還有一種女子跑街，她們的待遇比較上述的四種男子跑街大槪是要優　得多了；因為這班女子跑街大都是受有相當的敎育，而她們所推銷的貨品和推銷的途徑也與他們不同；她們的貨品大部份是直接向一般公館住宅裏推銷的。像這種人材，不獨要具備跑街的技能，而且還要有一種「出類」的外表；服飾的入時當然也是一個不可少的條件。所以一般公司商店，對這班女跑街多半是採用月薪制，使她們能毫無顧慮的去推銷，甚至有些女跑街坐的包車也是歸公司負責的。她們一個人每月的收入，最低也有三十多元；而且有些特種出品或日常飲料（如牛奶之類的東西）需要有醫學常識的人材去担任推銷，像這類的女跑街的進欵，大槪每月不會少過六十元的。</p>

Xiao Zhenying is scheduled to return to Tianjin from Beiping tomorrow morning and will meet with Doihara to begin consultations on the Hebei-East and Chahar-North issues. It is reported that regarding the Hebei-East issue, the two sides have previously had some contact and, although they have not yet reached a complete agreement, they are close. How to resolve it in the future will be known after Xiao and Doihara meet. Among the problems in North China, the two matters of Hebei-East and Chahar-North are the most important. Once these two matters are resolved, other issues such as the Chaoyangmen incident and related local issues will be easily resolved. Imai, the military attaché of the Japanese Embassy, said that the Tanggu incident is not as serious as rumored. The station is very close to the Japanese barracks, and the rumor that the Japanese flag was hung at the station may be a mistake for the Japanese flag of the barracks. If the two sides can meet frankly regarding the Chaoyangmen incident, it will not be difficult to resolve. The two issues of Hebei-East and Chahar-North are quite complex. Consultations can begin immediately after Doihara arrives in Tianjin. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: Regarding the current diplomatic problems of Hebei and Chahar provinces, the authorities in Beiping and Tianjin are studying how to deal with them. Itagaki, the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Japanese Kwantung Army, Tada, the Commander of the Garrison Army, and Nagami, the Chief of Staff, are now in Tianjin. Doihara will arrive in Tianjin tonight. Song Zheyuan and Xiao Zhenying will both go there within the next few days. It is expected that within the next week, the responsible persons from both China and Japan will continue to confer in Tianjin, hoping for an early resolution. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: It is confirmed that the pending matters in the Hebei-East negotiations are the withdrawal of the puppet security forces from Tangkou, the stationing of the Twenty-Ninth Army, the cessation of obstruction to the collection of salt taxes, and the interception of funds from the Beining Railway. The focus of the Chahar-East negotiations is on how to prevent southward invasion and ensure that the puppet troops along the Great Wall and the Mongolian security forces do not advance towards Zhangjiakou, southern Suiyuan, and the five eastern counties. The two negotiations are seemingly easy but actually difficult. The Japanese side will decide its attitude after Doihara arrives in Tianjin. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: Song Zheyuan is scheduled to come to Tianjin on the 13th with Xiao Zhenying, Chen Zhongfu, a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, and Pan Yugui, the Director of Political Affairs of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, to meet with relevant parties and discuss the Hebei-East and Chahar-East issues.

(Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: According to sources in diplomatic circles, the situation in Tanggu has not changed recently. The Japanese flag at the station has not been removed. The Zhao Lei security team shows no sign of advancing. The Twenty-Ninth Army troops are still stationed in Xinhe and Dagu. The two sides are about thirty or forty li apart. A solution to this matter is very easy to reach, as there are no other technicalities once the truth is clarified. As for the resolution of the Chaoyangmen incident, if the two sides meet with sincerity, their opinions will easily converge, and the problem can be solved. Doihara is scheduled to arrive in Tianjin from Dalian on the evening of the 11th regarding the two issues of Hebei-East and Chahar-North. It is expected that there will be an important meeting in Tianjin in a few days. (Eleventh Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Tianjin: According to Japanese newspapers, the leaders of the "Autonomy Movement" are now convening a meeting in Tianjin to consider the situation in North China. It is expected that the association will demand complete independence and implement "genuine autonomy." The "Autonomy Faction" is very dissatisfied with Song Zheyuan's activities. If Song does not change his policies, there will likely be continued "mass movements." (Eleventh Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: Negotiations between China and Japan on the Chahar-East and Hebei-East issues will resume in Tianjin within a few days. However, Chinese observers are quite pessimistic about the outcome. Doihara will arrive in Tianjin tonight, and Song and Xiao are scheduled to go to Tianjin tomorrow to meet with him, as well as with Itagaki. Bao Yueqing, the Secretary-General of the Inner Mongolia Political Council, is now in Tianjin as Prince De's representative, which has attracted much attention from the Chinese. According to Imai, the military attaché stationed in Beiping, Doihara does not bear full responsibility for the Tianjin negotiations. The Hebei-East and Chahar-East issues are both very complex, and both sides must be sincere to "eventually" achieve a solution. (Eleventh Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>— Bing</p>
<p>On the fifteenth of this month, principals and student representatives of specialized schools and above from various provinces and directly-administered municipalities with convenient transportation will gather in Nanjing to listen to the government's foreign policy and express opinions on safeguarding the country. This initiative by the government stems from the student patriotic movement that has shaken China and abroad. It aims to unify the will of the people and achieve a single-minded effort to save the country. The intention is good and commendable. Some may think that the joint entry of principals and students into Beijing is only for the purpose of listening to instructions, and newspapers also use the term "listening to instructions" in their reports. This is an inaccurate understanding, leading to a discrepancy between name and reality. In today's world where expert politics is praised, politicians should only disclose their political views and announce their understanding so that the people of the country can see and hear them together. There is no reason to cling to the old ideas of monarchism and teacher-centrism and simply issue a single instruction. A look at the order regarding this matter also does not contain any mention of "listening to instructions," which proves that the government's purpose in convening this meeting is to exchange opinions with the education sector, rather than simply ordering them to come to Beijing for training.</p>
<p>What kind of announcements will the government authorities make at this meeting, and what kind of statements will the attendees make? It is currently unknown beforehand. What we deeply hope is that, on the part of the government authorities, they must make a strong recognition of the necessity and urgency of national liberation, and at the same time, make detailed plans for the path to realizing national liberation. In addition to such announcements, they must also sincerely establish trust to show that it will definitely be fulfilled. The reason why students are running around and shouting slogans, and the reason why the people of the whole country are hesitant and worried, is that what they see and what they expect are not fully in line with each other, and the places that are not fully in line are precisely related to the life of the country and the nation. Therefore, they roll up their sleeves and rise up, echoing from the east and responding from the west. This is nothing but wanting to protect their own lives and protect the lives of the nation. If the government authorities resolutely make the above-mentioned announcements, then the doubts and fears of the masses will be completely dispelled, and all their thoughts and energy will be devoted to the struggle for national liberation. On the part of the attendees, what they state may not be outside the scope of the slogans and catchphrases raised previously, and what needs to be explained is that all of this is the publicly agreed will of the people of the whole country, and it must be fully realized. Moreover, when it is realized, the masses are willing to do everything in their power to achieve it. From the countryside to the streets, there are boiling hot blood and heroic strength. Those in power may not be fully aware of this, but it does not matter if they describe their psychology and voice to inform them. What needs to be stated in addition is that the student patriotic movement is by no means a school disturbance to drive away superiors and despise teachers, and school spirit issues should not be caused by this.</p>
<p>We sincerely hope that through this meeting, the will of the government and the people can truly be connected, and they can express their sincerity to each other and establish their trustworthiness. They should not write articles on paper or engage in philosophical discussions, but use clear and thorough reason and passionate feelings to form a strong will and develop heroic actions to jointly move towards the great road of national liberation.</p>

<p>Nanjing: Xu Shiying, the Chairman of the Relief Committee, arrived in Nanjing on the evening of the 11th. Because the various winter relief funds have been allocated to various places, it can be temporarily safe for a while. However, it is especially difficult during the period between the winter and the spring when the harvest has not yet arrived. Due to the economic depression, those who can donate in various places have already donated, and it is difficult to expect further donations. During his last visit to Nanjing, he once discussed the preparation of spring relief with President Chiang, hoping that the central government would allocate funds, but there is no resolution yet. This time, he will continue to discuss with the central government how to distribute seeds or provide loans. In addition, the issue of restoring the relief association's funding is still under request. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>

<p>Nanjing: The Judicial Yuan's interpretation of doubts about cases of punishment for violating the Factory Law is as follows: If a factory is fined, it is of course not allowed to be replaced by labor service.

<p>Moscow – Molotov, Chairman of the Soviet Russian People's Committee, today called for an increase in Soviet Russian armaments. Molotov based his argument on the news of the Japanese-German alliance, which he said threatened Soviet Russia. Molotov also gave a comprehensive overview of the world situation, harshly criticizing Japan, Germany, Poland, and Italy. He also stated that the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway demonstrated Soviet Russia's strong desire for peace, but Japan's refusal to sign a non-aggression pact and its unwillingness to form a committee to mediate disputes arising from the Soviet-Manchukuo border showed Japan's warmongering spirit. Regarding Germany, Molotov considered it to be an armed camp that threatened all of Europe. Molotov further said that the news of the German-Japanese military alliance was expected, as both countries had withdrawn from the League of Nations and both harbored aggressive ambitions. Molotov predicted that Soviet Russia would thrive this year. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>

<p>Washington – The Senate Foreign Relations Committee recently met to discuss the new Neutrality Act. It obtained the consent of Secretary of State Hull to delete a clause that would prohibit the shipment of certain goods to belligerent nations. This clause stipulated that if the President believed that the shipment of any goods that could be used for war to a belligerent nation would prolong the war, then he should prohibit their export. Some people criticized this clause, saying that it would closely link the United States with the sanctions imposed by the League of Nations, and that once the League of Nations passed a ban on the export of oil, the United States would have to participate. Therefore, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee deleted it. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Washington – The Senate Munitions Investigating Committee is continuing its investigation into how the Morgan bank provided financial assistance to the Allied Powers before the United States entered World War I. Morgan testified again today. Senator Clark, a member of the committee, said that in 1915, the Morgan bank stopped supporting the British pound, causing a panic in the foreign exchange market, and that its intention was to pressure the US government to accept loans to the Allied Powers. Morgan denied this. Clark then read a letter from Morgan to a certain branch office, which stated that on August 19, 1915, the British mail ship Arabic was sunk by a German submarine, and two American passengers were drowned, which greatly angered the United States and helped with the then-existing proposal to loan to Britain. Morgan admitted that this incident did indeed increase American sympathy for the Allied Powers and create a more favorable atmosphere for loans to Britain. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Washington – Details of the Senate Munitions Investigating Committee's questioning of the Morgan bank have already been sent in a separate telegram. Here are more details. Committee members stated that at the time, Britain had issued bonds totaling $500 million, but had been unable to sell them all. Therefore, the Morgan bank forced American manufacturers to purchase them. Senator Clark also read a letter from Morgan to the British branch office, stating that Britain should ask American manufacturers to purchase British bonds and use British purchases of American goods as a condition for exchange. Morgan replied that at the time, he had not forced American people to purchase British bonds. He also said that the claim that the US government's change in its neutrality policy and its loans to Britain were influenced by the Morgan bank was not true, and that "some people attack New York bankers, saying that they should be directly responsible for America's entry into the war. I specifically deny this statement." The committee then adjourned until Monday of next week. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Washington – Morgan, the internationally renowned banker, faced the Senate Munitions Investigating Committee today with a calm demeanor, and enthusiastically denied that the Morgan Company manipulated foreign exchange in 1915 and forced the US government to lend money to the Allied Powers through debt. Before the committee members could ask questions, Morgan stood up and said, "The committee clearly has a preconceived notion that we created the foreign exchange market panic in 1915. I want to deny that the Morgan Company ever had this intention." Senator Clark stated that because of the Morgan Company's assistance, the British pound was withdrawn, causing disruptions to America's booming wartime trade. The purpose was to force President Wilson to act. This is clearly evident from the documentary evidence. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3 id="e38">Isolated in Naval Conference: Japan Considers Policy: Drafting Instructions for Delegation: Cabinet Meeting Final Decision Today <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo – The Ministry of Foreign Affairs convened a leadership meeting on the morning of the 11th to discuss the government's draft instructions. In the afternoon, it was submitted to a joint conference of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of the Navy. The content is roughly as follows: The Japanese representatives should make efforts to explain the Japanese government's disarmament policy, with setting a common maximum limit system as a condition, advocating the total abolition of offensive weapons. Furthermore, they should sincerely explain Japan's attitude towards preparing for the total abolition of battleships, aircraft carriers, and Class A cruisers. The Japanese government does not want to express any opinion on the fact that the four countries of Britain, France, Italy, and the United States do not recognize Japan's disarmament policy, excluding the issue of quantitative limitations, and opening a four-country conference. However, since this is the case, they believe that the five-country disarmament conference will definitely conclude, and the four-country conference will start again. Japan will maintain a non-immediate, non-separated attitude towards this four-country conference. Regarding the issue of establishing a separate regulation restricting the use of submarines, and two or three other supplementary issues, based on past relations, they should be reviewed at the five-country conference, and there are no particular objections. (Domei dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – The Navy Department maintains its views on the instructions requested by the London delegation. The disarmament conference has no meaning to continue, so it requested an early vote on the success of the Japanese proposal, preparing to withdraw from the conference. For the four-country conference, observers can be sent to attend. (Domei dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – The government will hold an extraordinary cabinet meeting at the Prime Minister's official residence at 1:30 PM on the 12th.

After the cabinet formally decides, Foreign Minister Hirota will send these instructions to the delegation. (Domei dispatch, 11th)</p>

<p>Tokyo – The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, based on the request for instructions from the Japanese delegation in London, explained the course of the past conference and presented the opinions of the plenipotentiary representatives. The content is as follows: The Japanese delegation has made its best efforts, but the situation has reached its final stage. The Japanese side strongly advocates continuing to discuss quantitative limitations, but Britain claims that its shipbuilding notification plan is part of the quantitative limitation issue. The United States, France, and Italy also expressed sympathy with Britain, and a situation of opposition to Japan has arisen. Britain seems to intend to discuss the quantitative issue again after reviewing the notification plan, but this is not what we can expect. The Japanese delegation expressed opposition to the above-mentioned procedural matters. The four countries of Britain, the United States, France, and Italy will request our side to send observers to attend the conference. If we refuse, the four countries will continue the conference. Should Japan send observers? Please request instructions in reply. Also, how about ordering France and Italy to participate in the fourth section of the London Treaty, restricting the use of submarines, and making it a separate regulation? Please request instructions in reply. Japan should consider this situation, request the conference to declare a recess, or participate in the review of the notification plan, and wait for the re-examination of the quantitative issue. When the conference turns into a four-country conference, what attitude should be taken? Please urgently request instructions. (Domei dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3 id="e40">Japanese Representatives Seek Outcome: Naval Conference Repeatedly Postponed: British Government Consults with Dominions <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>London – It has been learned that the naval conference originally scheduled to be held on Monday has been postponed to Tuesday. This was requested by the Japanese delegation because the Tokyo Cabinet will consider this matter tomorrow. At the same time, representatives from Britain and its overseas dominions are currently meeting to discuss the policies that the British Empire must adopt after Japan withdraws from the conference. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>London – Efforts are currently being made to retain Japan in the naval conference. At the same time, representatives from Britain and its dominions met this afternoon at the Foreign Office to discuss the policies that the British Empire delegation should adopt if Japan withdraws from the conference. The Japanese delegation requested a discussion of its naval equality proposal. Today, the British chief representative, Navy Minister Monsell, agreed to postpone the exchange of shipbuilding program proposals at the naval conference on Monday and listen to the Japanese representatives' views on a common maximum limit and make a public announcement on this. The opposition attitude of other delegations is well known, so Japan's withdrawal from the conference can be predicted. After Japan withdraws from the naval conference, the conference will continue by the four countries of Britain, the United States, France, and Italy, or Russia and Germany will be invited to join. As for the procedures to be followed thereafter, they have not yet been determined. The general idea is to pass a mutual exchange of shipbuilding program proposals and agree on some qualitative restrictions, such as reducing the size of battleships and cruisers. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>London – Regarding the invitation of Russia and Germany to participate, naval officials said that this naval conference was only attended by representatives of the signatory countries of the Washington Naval Treaty and the London Naval Treaty, namely Britain, the United States, France, Italy, and Japan. The invitation of representatives from other countries has never been considered, but if the proposed five-nation naval agreement cannot be reached, then it should be discussed separately. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>London – According to this agency's correspondent at the naval conference, the British and American delegations have both accepted changing the conference procedure and will re-discuss the common maximum quota issue proposed by Japan on Monday. The reason for this is to take the opportunity to clearly explain the point that they cannot accept Japan's demands. Some people believe that the confrontation between Japan and the United States is the reason for the failure of the naval conference. This can be clearly demonstrated by the attitude adopted by Britain and the United States. It should be known that the principle of common maximum quota held by Japan is not only opposed by Britain and the United States, but also by Italy and France. It is now believed that once Japan announces its withdrawal from the conference, the naval conference will continue by the four countries of Britain, France, Italy, and the United States. The four delegations generally agree that this approach will enable the resolution of some technical issues. In addition, other countries, such as Germany and Russia, may be invited to participate, but before the four-country conference is actually held, a six-country conference is unlikely to become a reality. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>London – It seems that the United States is absolutely unwilling to accept the principle of common maximum quota proposed by Japan. Although Britain also fundamentally opposes it, it may eventually be willing to compromise and start a more extensive study of Japan's claims. Today, the British delegation consulted with various national delegations separately. It is reported that it asked the French delegation to persuade the Japanese representatives to change their attitude and not remain so rigid, in order to extend the time of the conference. Britain's attitude is actually afraid that the naval conference will divide the camp and place Japan in an extreme position, which would hinder political talks between the two countries in the future. Therefore, it is eager to avoid this. As for the Japanese delegation, it is currently awaiting new instructions from its government. If these instructions are as rumored, their nature will cause the naval conference to come to an end. However, some optimists still hope that the new instructions from Tokyo can at least allow the naval conference to continue its last gasp. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>London – Britain and the United States today agreed to abandon Japan and France and Italy and continue the London Naval Conference. This decision is the result of the five-nation conference reaching a stalemate after Japan proposed a common maximum naval limit. The complete failure of the conference is becoming increasingly inevitable, so Britain and the United States are taking this step and isolating Japan. According to reliable sources, British Foreign Secretary Eden warned the Japanese chief naval representative, Admiral Nagano, that Japan's unwillingness to compromise may affect Britain's Far East policy. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>London – The Daily Mail recently criticized the future of the naval conference, saying, "Britain, the United States, and Russia are all Pacific powers. Although their convening to conclude a Pacific agreement seems surprising on the surface, it is not impossible in reality. If the situation develops in this direction, then Japan's attitude towards the naval conference may change within the last minute. But it is still uncertain." The newspaper also said that the naval conference was originally composed of five countries: Britain, the United States, France, Italy, and Japan. Once Japan withdraws, Germany and Russia may join and become a six-country conference. This has already been explored. The British government invited the ambassadors of Germany and Russia to the reception for the delegations to the naval conference on Thursday for this reason. "As for Germany's attendance at the six-country conference, it is still hesitant, while Russia is prepared to participate. The superficial goal of this conference is to negotiate a temporary agreement to limit the maximum tonnage of various warships and to exchange shipbuilding information between the countries concerned. However, with representatives from Britain, the United States, and Russia gathered in one place, and with the Japanese representatives having withdrawn on their own, it is not impossible for various issues in the Pacific and the Far East to be discussed in the conference."

<p>Washington – After the Supreme Court ruled the Agricultural Adjustment Act illegal, President Roosevelt spoke to reporters today about rural problems, saying that rural areas are a difficult problem for the country and that he felt it was his responsibility to treat it as a difficult problem. He decided to deal with this problem by preserving soil fertility and managing production. "We must avoid any national agricultural policy that could result in transferring the country's soil fertility abroad." This statement implies disapproval of subsidies. When speaking, President Roosevelt carefully avoided discussing any concrete plans, only saying that he wanted to seek legislation during this Congressional session to fulfill his responsibility to farmers. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Washington – President Roosevelt has extended the effective period of the clause in the Gold Reserve Act establishing a stabilization fund for one year. When President Roosevelt announced this, he said that the emergency situation that existed when this bill was signed on January 30, 1934, had not yet been eliminated by international monetary agreements, and that in all respects, there were signs of its increasing weight, because the situation of international commerce and foreign exchange rates were not calm. President Roosevelt also extended the power, which is about to expire, granted to the President by the May 12, 1933 Act to stipulate that the weight of the gold dollar cannot be less than half of the legal weight at the time, nor more than 60% of the legal weight. However, this announcement did not mention changing the gold dollar's 59.06-base plan. President Roosevelt added that this announcement extends the President's power to reduce the value of the gold dollar. After consulting with Attorney General Cummings, according to Hengjie's interpretation, this announcement does indeed extend the President's power to devalue the currency. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Washington – The House of Representatives today passed a bill authorizing the immediate payment of cash bonuses to 3.5 million veterans, in amounts ranging from $1 billion to $2 billion. The bill passed by a large majority of 355 to 59, and has since been sent to the Senate. A conflict will now arise between the President and Congress. If the Senate also passes it, President Roosevelt may veto it, but it is expected that Congress will override the President's veto by a majority vote. Supporters of this bill in the House of Representatives include members of both the Democratic and Republican parties. The bill does not mention the source of the necessary funding. Members of Congress who advocate inflation are now supporting this bill, so that new currency can be issued with the gold reserve in the treasury as collateral to pay for this bonus. This bill is a compromise between those who advocate inflation and those who advocate issuing public bonds. As for whether to adopt inflation or issue public bonds, the government will be free to choose. Judging from this bill, the trend of inflation has at least temporarily disappeared, because the supporters of Bateman's proposal to issue $2 billion in new banknotes have now agreed that if the majority of the House of Representatives does not support this bill, then they will not continue their efforts. However, one thing to note is that Congress may not support any proposal to increase taxes to raise money for the bonus. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>

<p>Washington – The Department of Commerce announced today that in the first eleven months of 1935, China had a trade surplus with the United States of $22,197,000, compared to a trade deficit of $23,788,000 in the same period in 1934. This was due to the fact that the United States imported a total of $57,234,000 worth of goods from China, an increase of 40% compared to 1934, and exported a total of $35,037,000 worth of goods to China, a decrease of 45% compared to 1934. Experts say that this has indeed reduced the burden on China's exchange rate stabilization, but the remittances from overseas Chinese to their homeland and other donations have decreased, which may offset this trade surplus. However, since the Chinese Yuan has recently appreciated, these remittances may continue to increase. China was in the process of reforming its currency in November of last year, but it was still able to maintain a trade surplus, which is a good sign for China's future. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>

They reviewed the contents of the draft fiscal policy speech that Finance Minister Takahashi will deliver on the day the parliament reopens. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM. The content first explained in detail the draft budget for the 11th year of Showa, and reported on the current domestic economic situation, trade matters, and international balance of payments. What is noteworthy is that it mentioned the tax increase issue, saying that according to the current national situation, a huge amount of national defense spending is needed externally, and due to frequent disasters in recent years, rural areas are impoverished, and a large amount of funding has to be spent internally. Therefore, it is difficult to expect a reduction in national spending. However, considering all kinds of matters, now is not yet the time to implement a tax increase. Therefore, the revenue shortfall has to be made up for by public bonds. (Domei dispatch, 11th)</p>

<p>The disposition of British troops in the Near East, specifically in Alexandria, is clearly defensive rather than offensive. However, the recent increase in garrison strength and other preparations are sufficient to demonstrate Britain's determination to protect Egypt and imperial lines of communication against enemy incursions. The only route for an enemy attack from the west is along the coast from the border town of Sollum to the port of Alexandria. Egyptian camel corps soldiers are now stationed day and night in the sand dunes between the border and Sollum, watching for enemy movements. Italian soldiers are perched on rooftops and fortresses, surveying the desert with telescopes. In the current situation, no army in the world is capable of reaching the port of Alexandria from the west. Moreover, the Bedouin tribes of the western desert are not favorably disposed toward Italy. A Reuters correspondent spoke today with Italian officers outside the barbed wire barriers at the border; they all scoffed at the idea of an Italian attack. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>

<p>Paris: Yugoslav sources announced today that the French and British fleets will indeed encircle Italy before the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting on January 20. It is claimed that a decision has been made to station nineteen British warships in the Yugoslav naval port of Split on the Adriatic coast. At the same time, other British warships will visit other ports such as Catalonia. The French fleet is currently busy loading coal and ammunition in preparation for major exercises, first in Corsica and then in the South Atlantic. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>London: As far as this agency's reporter knows, the British government is now trying to bring the East African war to a swift end. This is not solely for the sake of success in the League of Nations' policies, but also for the sake of Italy. In the near future, Italy may become an important factor in maintaining the balance of power in Europe, and it cannot be allowed to deplete its economic and military strength any further due to colonial affairs. Vasconcelos, chairman of the League of Nations' Committee of Eighteen, will convene the committee when the Council of Thirteen meets on the 20th of this month to discuss the oil embargo issue. Political figures here believe that the government will authorize Foreign Secretary Eden to support Vasconcelos' proposal. Generally, after the Committee of Eighteen meets, it will appoint several experts to submit detailed reports on the following: 1. Investigate Italy's oil reserves; 2. Estimate Italy's oil consumption during the Abyssinian rainy season; 3. Investigate the amount of oil that can be shipped to Italy from America. Once the experts' reports have been submitted, the Committee of Eighteen will further inquire whether the implementation of an oil embargo can immediately stop the East African war under the current circumstances. If it can, then for the sake of preserving Italy's strength, the Committee of Eighteen may even vote to pass the embargo measures. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Geneva: The League of Nations Administrative Council is scheduled to meet on the 20th of this month. The League of Nations Committee of Eighteen will also meet on the same day, and its chairman, Portuguese representative Vasconcelos, will raise the issue of tightening the oil embargo against Italy. Regarding the oil embargo issue, no decision is likely to be made until the U.S. Congress passes the new Neutrality Act. League of Nations officials believe that even if the Committee of Eighteen and the Council of Thirteen hold meetings before the Administrative Council meeting, it would be useless. Therefore, the chairmen of the committees, Vasconcelos and Madariaga, both advocate holding meetings concurrently with the Administrative Council. League of Nations officials consider this aspect to be of great importance. The task of the Committee of Eighteen is to discuss sanctions against Italy, while the Council of Thirteen seeks a peaceful resolution to the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Paris: The renowned left-wing journalist Thibaud today wrote an article predicting the possibility of a renewed resolution of the Italian-Abyssinian issue, with the following main approaches: 1. Italy would request the League of Nations to appoint a neutral committee to go to Abyssinia, ostensibly to inspect Italy's methods of warfare, but in reality to study the possibility of reconciliation; 2. Belgium would suggest to the League of Nations that it appoint a Council of Thirteen to establish a kind of peace plan, mainly based on the joint development of Abyssinia by Britain, France, and Italy, while maintaining the Abyssinian Emperor's sovereignty over Abyssinia; 3. Efforts would be made to persuade the Abyssinian Emperor to request assistance from the League of Nations, and then the League of Nations would suggest to the Abyssinian Emperor that he employ British and French experts to study ways to improve Abyssinia's social, economic, and financial status. Thibaud also predicted that Britain and France might lend money to the Abyssinian Emperor to develop the entire country and subdue tribal chiefs who have been ambiguous in their attitude towards his rule. On the other hand, an Italian spokesman declared today that if the League of Nations is prepared to correct the errors of the Treaty of Versailles, then Italy is prepared to attend the next League of Nations meeting; if no satisfactory results are achieved, then Italy must completely conquer Abyssinia. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>Paris: An international affairs reporter for the 'Business News' recently learned that the major powers believe that if an African nation were to defeat a major European power in the Italian-Abyssinian War, not only would the balance of power among European nations be affected, but the peace and order of various colonies would also be endangered. The following methods are now being considered to seek a swift resolution of the Italian-Abyssinian dispute: that the League of Nations, at the request of the Italian government, organize a fact-finding committee to send to Abyssinia to investigate the Italian army's methods of warfare; after the investigation, to seize the opportunity to draft a peace plan and submit it to the League of Nations. This peace plan should not only emphasize Italy's needs, but also affirm the necessity of European assistance to Abyssinia. The reporter also learned that the Belgian government has submitted a proposal to the League of Nations Council of Thirteen to resolve the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, advocating that the Abyssinian Emperor personally request the League of Nations to entrust Britain and France to jointly study with the Abyssinian Emperor the necessary plans to improve Abyssinia's economic situation; when Britain and France assist Abyssinia, they should invite the League of Nations to participate in cooperation, and this improvement plan should be financially supported by Britain and France.

<p>Munich: Although officials deny reports of large numbers of Italians fleeing into Germany and Austria to evade military service in East Africa, the Associated Press reporter learned today from several northern Italian residents that about two thousand Italians have already fled. Anti-Italian sentiment is most intense in the Tyrol region, where military authorities have been forced to go house-to-house to forcibly draft men into the army. Last September, nine Tyroleans were reportedly executed in Frankfurt for refusing to be drafted. (National News Agency dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: It is raining heavily in Abyssinia. According to elderly people, such heavy rain at this time of year has never been seen before. Judging from various weather signs, it may not clear up for some time. It is generally believed that this is very beneficial to the Abyssinian army. Today, according to eyewitnesses to the battle of the Quina Pass, Abyssinian patrols overlooking the pass from the mountains saw several Italian tanks stopped in a valley below. They urgently summoned reinforcements and, after dusk, stealthily descended the mountain carrying huge rocks, blocking both ends of the valley, preventing the tanks from entering or exiting. At dawn, the Abyssinian army attacked in dense formation. The Italian army opened fire, but although dozens of Abyssinian soldiers were killed or wounded, they eventually surrounded the tanks due to their superior numbers, and shot down the Italian soldiers in the tanks. After an hour of fighting, the Italian army was unable to hold out and surrendered. According to the Abyssinian army, they captured ten tanks in this battle. In total, the Abyssinian army has captured twenty-four tanks, of which only one was damaged and cannot be repaired. The Abyssinian army's general headquarters has sent specialized technicians to inspect them and train soldiers to use them, to form the initial Abyssinian tank unit. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>

<p>New York: Bruno Hauptmann, the killer of Charles Lindbergh Jr., is scheduled to be executed in the electric chair on January 17. Meanwhile, Dr. Condon, who had previously been the intermediary between the kidnapper and Lindbergh, suddenly departed for South America this afternoon. It is claimed that he now needs a long period of rest, so it is difficult to predict when he will return to the country. At the same time, according to news from Trenton, New Jersey, Governor Hoffman has requested that a magazine retrieve the original manuscript of an article written by Dr. Condon, detailing everything about the Hauptmann case, for his review.

<h3 id="e67">Western Shandong Suffers Heavy Losses in Floods; Zhengza Tax Revenue in Ten Counties Decreases by More Than 700,000; Four-Fifths of School-Age Children in Jining Drop Out of School <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Jining Correspondence: Last year, the Yellow River breached its banks in Juancheng, flooding half of western Shandong and affecting counties in northern Jiangsu. Half a year has passed, but the breach has not yet been closed. Shandong Province established a county administration construction experimental zone, which includes fourteen counties in western Shandong. Ten of these counties were affected by the disaster. Many victims fled to other places for food. They had hoped to harvest wheat this spring to prolong their lives. However, it has been reported that the ice formed by the recent Yellow River floodwaters has melted again, and the water level has risen again, submerging the planted wheat. The devastation is complete, and it is feared that the region will not recover its vitality for ten years. Taking Jining as an example, there are currently only 82 elementary schools in the county, a decrease of two-thirds compared to before (mostly due to closures caused by the floods). Educational expenses are more than 48,000 yuan, a decrease of six-tenths compared to before. The former People's Education Center has been converted into a citizen's school. There are more than 50,000 school-age children in the county, but only over 9,000 are currently enrolled, and over 40,000 have dropped out of school. As for construction, the automobile road from Jining to Jinxiang, Yutai, and Jiaxiang has been washed away by the water and has not yet been restored. The county's telephone line, which runs from Jining county seat south to Tankouji, Tangkou, and Heshangqiao, has also been destroyed. The dikes on the county's rivers have been severely damaged by the Yellow River water, and the riverbeds have been silted up with Yellow River mud and sand, reducing their drainage capacity. Future autumn and summer rainy seasons will likely bring unavoidable floods. One county is like this, and the others can be inferred. Therefore, the water disaster has caused extraordinarily heavy local losses, unprecedented in its scale. Sun Zerang, director of the Heze branch of the Shandong Provincial Rural Construction Research Institute, has come to Jining to welcome Li Shuchun, director of the Civil Affairs Department. According to Sun, one-third of Heze county was affected by the disaster. The rural agricultural school had graduated three classes, totaling six thousand people, who have all retired to their home villages. Other counties have also graduated three classes, numbering two to three thousand people. During this water disaster, there were no reports of banditry in the countryside, thanks to the self-defense efforts of the students of the rural schools. Now that the weather is warm, the ice formed by the Yellow River water has melted again, and the water level is the same as during last year's major flood. Spring wheat planted in Heze, Juye, and other counties has been submerged again. The Experimental Zone Governor's Office has compiled detailed statistics on the collection and exemption of Zhengza taxes in the ten disaster-stricken counties and four non-disaster-stricken counties under its jurisdiction, as follows, to show the terrible extent of the disaster.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Geologist Ding Wenjiang Dies of Poisoning in Hunan; Ordered to Hunan to Investigate Geology; Hospital Complies with Instructions to Perform Autopsy <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Geologist Mr. Ding Wenjiang, dispatched to Hunan to investigate mining, suddenly suffered coal poisoning in Hengyang. He was rushed to Xiangya Hospital for treatment, but medical treatment was ineffective. He unfortunately passed away at 5:45 PM on the 5th. Mr. Ding was a world-renowned geologist. His death is not only a great loss to the Chinese scientific community. The details of his poisoning, medical treatment, and death are recorded in detail below:</p>
<p>Details of Poisoning: Mr. Ding was dispatched to Hunan a month ago to investigate geology. He stayed in Changsha for several days and then traveled by car to Hengyang, where he stayed at the residence of a friend. However, feeling excessively fatigued from the journey, he took a small dose of sleeping pills and went to bed to rest. A servant of his friend, fearing that the cold air in Mr. Ding's bedroom would cause discomfort and that hospitality would be lacking, tightly closed the windows and filled the stove with coal to burn and ward off the cold. When they asked Mr. Ding to breakfast the next morning, they unexpectedly found that Mr. Ding had already suffered coal poisoning. His breathing had stopped, with only a faint breath at his heart. They immediately hired a Western doctor in Hengyang to treat him with artificial respiration and urgently telegraphed Xiangya Hospital, requesting that a doctor be sent to administer treatment. Zhu Jingnong, the Director of the Hunan Education Department, was a close friend of Mr. Ding. Upon hearing the news, he immediately accompanied Wang Zihuan, the President of Xiangya Hospital, Yang Jishi, the Director of Internal Medicine, and others to Hengyang in a special car. Although Mr. Ding was resuscitated after several hours of artificial respiration, he had been poisoned for more than eighteen hours. Moreover, when artificial respiration was administered, the doctor rubbed his ribs with both hands, causing severe injury. Therefore, Zhu, Wang, Yang, and others decided to take him to Xiangya Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Details of Treatment: After Mr. Ding was admitted to Xiangya Hospital, President Wang Zihuan and Director Yang Jishi took charge of the consultation. Miss Jue, the head nurse of the hospital, was assigned to oversee nursing. Four additional experienced nurses were selected and placed under Miss Jue's command. Miss Jue, a Westerner, took great care of Mr. Ding. She personally bathed Mr. Ding and provided him with all kinds of precious items he needed for his diet. However, although the coal poisoning Mr. Ding suffered gradually subsided, the rib injuries he sustained during treatment in Hengyang eventually became inflamed, and the wound discharged pus. After the doctor incised and removed the pus, the remaining toxins were not easily cleared, and the brain suffered severe stimulation as a result, ultimately leading to the failure of medical treatment. Thus, this world-renowned geologist, who once shook the world, passed away.</p>
<p>Autopsy Performed: When Mr. Ding was bedridden in Xiangya Hospital, knowing that his illness was serious and difficult to cure, he instructed the doctor that after his death, he wished to have his body dissected by the hospital. Mr. Ding, as a scientist during his lifetime, maintained his respect for science even in death. Therefore, all the doctors at Xiangya Hospital performed an autopsy at 11 PM last night in the Xiangya Medical Grand Auditorium. Medical students and faculty of Xiangya also participated. The autopsy results proved that the cause of Mr. Ding's death was the excessive force used during artificial respiration when he was poisoned in Hengyang. The hospital has already drafted a report, which will be released to the public soon.</p>
<p>Family's Grief: Since Mr. Ding passed away in Xiangya, his family, including his wife, Mrs. Shi, and his younger brothers, Wenlan and Wenhao, were by his side. Their grief was extraordinary. Mrs. Shi wept over the body, almost wanting to follow him to the grave. Wenlan and Wenzhi tried to maintain a calm demeanor, but reason could not overcome emotion, and their inner grief was evident in their tears. It is said that Mr. Ding's parents both died before the age of fifty. Mr. Ding, who was now over fifty years old, knew that he would not live long. He had already written his will the year before last, entrusting all his affairs to his wife, Mrs. Shi, and his younger brothers, Wenlan and Wenzhi. Now, unfortunately, it has become a reality. Those who suffer from coal poisoning are usually most numerous in the north. Mr. Ding served in the north for a long time but was not poisoned. Instead, he was poisoned in Hengyang. Is there truly a master in the dark?</p>
<p>Foreign Consuls' Concern: The consuls of the United Kingdom and the United States stationed in Hunan, regarding Mr. Ding as a world scholar, expressed deep concern for him after he became bedridden in Xiangya. They frequently inquired about his condition and telegraphed their respective governments without sparing expense, demonstrating the importance attached to Mr. Ding by various countries around the world. Upon hearing of Mr. Ding's death, they expressed condolences and lamented it as a great loss to the scientific community.</p>

The consul of that country initially prevaricated, and only at the end of last month did he formally reply to the municipal government in an official document, denying the interception and robbery, claiming that the smuggled goods were the goods of merchants of that country, which had been mistakenly taken by the customs enforcement team and had been returned by the customs authorities. He also stated that among the rice seized by the customs enforcement team during the search for smuggled rice in Shantou at Jiafa Shop on Deanhou Street, 25 bags belonged to merchants of that country, and demanded that we return them. After receiving this reply, the Shantou Municipal Government, considering that the fact that ronin had intercepted and robbed the customs enforcement ship and its cargo was clear, and should not be allowed to be denied, again cited various pieces of evidence on the 31st of last month to refute the consul of that country, demanding that the consul severely punish the ronin who caused the incident, return the robbed ship and cargo, apologize to us, and guarantee that the same incident would not happen again. As for the consul's request to return the foreign rice seized from Jiafa Shop belonging to merchants of that country, the municipal government, as it was unclear about the actual situation at the time, specially wrote to the Chao-Shan Customs Enforcement Office to investigate and reply for handling. Later, due to a three-day holiday for New Year's Day, government agencies and consulates only began to work on the 4th, and the two sides are still negotiating. It is reported that the Chao-Shan Customs Enforcement Office recently decided to arrest several local merchants in Chao-Shan who colluded with foreign smugglers, and sent a team to escort them to the province for punishment. At the same time, the stores of these traitors were sealed up, giving them the most severe punishment, in order to warn the stubborn. Therefore, the traitors who had previously had dealings with foreign smugglers were quite afraid and have changed their businesses to legitimate ones. However, foreign smugglers are still actively engaged in smuggling operations. Their cunning schemes involve changing the form of smuggled goods and disguising them as taxed goods, and then transporting them into the mainland for sale. It is reported that recently, many ronin have been found in the market buying old rice, bean, and hemp bags with tax stamps, because these hemp bags have tax stamps from the agricultural tax bureau, and can be used to pack smuggled goods, which can easily deceive people. In addition, some smuggle rice and beans by packing them in old wooden boxes or large porcelain jars to deceive inspectors. There are all kinds of tricks, nothing is too strange. Merchants from a certain country also fear losses, so recently they have personally escorted the smuggled goods transported from Shantou to the mainland to avoid being arrested. It is reported that the best-selling smuggled goods at present are broken rice. On the 6th and 7th of this month, a certain smuggling gang imported another batch of untaxed foreign rice, totaling more than 20,000 bags, from Southeast Asia. It is expected that they will use the above-mentioned disguise methods to sell them in Chao-Shan. It is reported that the Chao-Mei Agricultural Tax Bureau is paying close attention to this and plans to set up a proper method to prevent smuggled goods from being disguised as taxed goods. The customs enforcement office has also ordered close investigation to prevent leakage. (7th)</p>
<h3 id="e70">The Financial Crisis of Militaristic Japan (Part 2) <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Fu</p>
<p>Regarding the increase in tax revenue, the estimated figures for next year are shown in Table 5 below:</p>
<p>Table 5 Estimated Tax Revenue for Next Year (Unit: 1,000 Yen)</p>
<p>(Increase/Decrease compared to this year) Income Tax 332,000 36,000 Land Tax 58,000 —— Business Profit Tax 62,000 11,000 Capital Interest Tax 15,000 —— Inheritance Tax 32,000 3,600 Liquor Tax 209,000 3,000 Sugar Consumption Tax 87,000 9,000 Textile Consumption Tax 42,000 9,000 Exchange Tax 14,000 1,600 Customs Duty 158,000 28,000 Stamp Revenue 79,000 2,500</p>
<p>(The above figures include 3 million yen from the revision of the Iron Manufacturing Promotion Law and 4 million yen from the revision of the Mineral Oil Tax – November 27, "Tokyo Asahi")</p>
<p>From the above figures, the most significant increases are in income tax and business profit tax, while the main decreases are in liquor tax, exchange tax, and stamp revenue. In this natural increase, we see that the increase in revenue is mainly from taxes based on assessment. In reality, stamp duty, liquor tax, exchange tax, etc., which increased due to the recovery of the economy, not only did not increase but decreased. Therefore, we can know that this kind of natural increase is not enough to indicate an improvement in the economic situation, but can only explain the improvement of tax collection technology and more stringent assessment. In addition, the increase in customs duties is not due to a turnaround in the economy, but to the revision of customs duty rates. (This fact can be seen from the fact that the increase in tonnage tax is not very large.) Therefore, the financial authorities believe that the so-called "natural" increase in financial improvement is essentially a disguised name for "coercive" increase. Because of coercion and manpower, its increase is also limited. Its rate of increase cannot keep pace with the rapidly increasing military expenditure, which is even more obvious.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is the assistance (accommodation) of special accounts. This is clearly just a temporary method used to alleviate the difficulty of budget compilation. According to the "Tokyo Asahi" on November 27, the amount of accommodation from special accounts that have never been diverted in the past is 12.5 million yen in next year's budget, including:</p>
<p>Table 6 Accommodation Amount of Special Accounts for Next Year (Unit: 1,000 Yen)</p>
<p>Managed by the Ministry of Railways (20% of the surplus of special accounts) 5,400</p>
<p>Managed by the Ministry of Colonial Affairs (10% of the surplus of special accounts in Korea, Taiwan, Karafuto, and the South Seas Agency) 5,000</p>
<p>Managed by the Ministry of Communications (20% of the surplus of the communication business special accounts) 2,100</p>
<p>Total 12,500</p>
<p>This kind of accommodation, in addition to showing the depletion of financial resources, clearly shows a plan to sacrifice colonial finance in order to share the deficit of the central general account. As for the third point, it is because the military's attitude is tough, and they had to admit the 20 million yen of resurrected demands. On the one hand, there is no way to find compensation from public bonds, and finally, the scattered financial resources are scraped together from various provinces - the so-called "cooperative budget of various provinces". Here, in addition to accommodating special accounts from the Ministries of Railways, Communications, and Colonial Affairs, they even fantastically ordered the Japan Iron Manufacturing Company, under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, to increase dividends and allocate 2.8 million yen from the increased revenue from government shares. (The capital of Japan Iron Manufacturing is probably 159 million, of which 280 million are government shares, accounting for 80%. It is estimated that dividends will increase from 6% to 7%)!</p>
<p>From the above observations, we can know that the so-called gradual reduction of deficit bonds is only a slogan of temporarily muddling through using financial means, and on the other hand, it shows the extreme anxiety about the future of finance and the need for a universalization of financial technology caused by this anxiety.</p>
<p>In short, the extraordinary budget containing a huge amount of 1.05 billion in military expenditure has finally been compiled by piecing together. But what about the future? In response to the demands of financial capitalists, the deficit bonds have been reduced in appearance, but military expenditure is still expanding endlessly. Domestic financial resources have long been exhausted. Increasing taxes in general, using the increased burden on the poor to meet the demands of military expenditure, is no longer as simple as imagined. The progress of the proletarian parties in this year's local elections, and the qualitative and quantitative increase in labor disputes and tenant disputes in the past year, all indicate that Takahashi's statement that "natural disasters are constant, people's livelihoods are haggard, and there are many aspects of social policy worthy of consideration" is not just a concern. On the mainland, although adventurers have fortunately obtained a large piece of fat, regrettably there is no gastric juice in their own stomach to digest this fat and turn it into their own nourishment! Next year is the year of naval military expansion competition, so what will be used to satisfy this insatiable demand then?</p>
<p>The "gradual reduction of deficit bonds" completed by the "superhuman" efforts of the 82-year-old man has temporarily given the Japanese financial community a bit of heroic excitement and reassurance, but after this excitement cools down, the reassurance will quickly follow and also waver. The deficit bonds are gradually reduced, but the deficit in expenditure remains! So they began to stare at and worry about this permanent expansion of military expenditure. To overcome it, or to be overcome? In the point of gradual reduction of deficit bonds in next year's budget, the financiers overcame the military in appearance, but wasn't the military expenditure still increased by 38 million? In essence, it was still overcome. The comments in the "Tokyo Asahi" on December 1st and 2nd are extremely suggestive.</p>
<p>"The international situation in the Far East is now extremely clear in that Japan occupies a leading position. Since it already occupies the position of a leader, the regulation of the urgency of the international situation can, of course, be influenced by Japan to some extent. This is the basis for the possibility of granting a certain degree of flexibility to military expenditure. There are certainly absolute elements in military expenditure, but to regard all military expenditure as absolute and make the financial plan bow before it is a matter that the military authorities should also carefully consider." (1st: "Still a Confused Budget")</p>
<p>"Military expenditure of 1.05 billion yen accounts for 47% of the total budget. This is an increase of 38 million yen over this year. The demands of the General Staff Headquarters have been compromised, but if this is still not satisfactory, then how long will this trend continue? Just like what former Minister of the Army Araki said about the year in which the Manchurian Incident expenses will be normalized is something that the people cannot estimate. The lack of a fixed national policy on this expansion of military expenditure is really something that makes the people extremely uneasy.</p>
<p>"In this sense, the people who believe in the unclear state system also hope for the clarification of national defense and the establishment of a national policy on national defense. The cabinet members who cooperated in the budget cabinet should make greater efforts than piecing together financial resources, and should not be dragged along by the military. Everyone should work together to establish national policies in their own field, and at the same time, the military's autonomy should also take into account the strength of guiding the international situation, and give the people a prospect and reassurance regarding the future of military expenditure." (2nd: "The Future of Military Expenditure and the Establishment of National Policy")</p>
<p>Can this hope be realized? The attitude taken by the military recently and the facts mentioned above have all shown that the answer is pessimistic and uncertain. (Written in Kyoto on December 24, 1935)</p>

<h3 id="e71">Antung Sailing Ship Encountered Disaster at Sea; Adrift at Sea for More Than a Month; Ten Died of Starvation Out of Fifty-Nine <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The Public Security Sixth Branch of this city discovered a distressed sailing ship near Kaolao Island, Rongcheng yesterday. Because it had been drifting at sea for more than a month, ten of the fifty-nine crew members and passengers had starved to death. The details of the ship's disaster are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Encountering Wind Mid-Journey: The ship was a large sailing ship from Antung named "Jin Zeng," ship number An Zi No. 1006, owned by Sun Shengqi, a native of Antung. The ship was chartered by people from Rizhao and Zhucheng counties to transport coffins to Rizhao County. The ship carried 107 sets of human bones, in addition to four coffins. There were a total of fifty-nine crew members and passengers. It departed from Antung on the seventh day of the eleventh month of the old calendar. After sailing for a day and a night, it suddenly encountered a hurricane. Both oars and rudder were lost, and it no longer had the ability to control itself. It could only drift in the turbulent waves and rely on fate.</p>
<p>Adrift for More Than a Month: After the ship drifted south with the wind, it drifted to the sea south of Korea. It was at sea for more than a month, unable to reach the shore. The food it carried was only enough for more than twenty days. When the food ran out, and the weather was cold and there were no clothes to keep warm, ten people died one after another due to hunger and cold. The remaining people knelt on the ship to pray, or knelt before the spirits and wept, asking the gods to protect them. In despair, they could only sit and wait for death.</p>
<p>Drifting to Qingdao: As it turned out, there is always a way out. Six or seven days ago, a strong east wind suddenly blew on the sea, and the ship drifted westward with the wind. At that time, all the boatmen were overjoyed. After five days and nights of struggle, it sailed to Kaolao Island near Rongcheng and was able to reach the shore. Statistics show that it had been drifting in the water for more than thirty days. In addition to the dead, there were still forty-nine survivors. Surviving from death can be said to be fortunate.</p>
<p>Authorities Provide Relief: After the ship arrived at Kaolao Island, it landed ashore and went to the police station of the Public Security Sixth Branch in Laoshan to report the disaster. The police station immediately reported the situation to the Public Security Bureau and asked for instructions on how to deal with it. After receiving the report, the bureau ordered the Sixth Branch to first prepare food for the passengers and boatmen, and then raise funds to send the passengers back to their original hometowns.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Shandong Provincial Department of Finance Encourages Silver Shops to Make Loans to Rescue All Industries in Jinan; Loan Amount 1.5 Million <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: This year, Shandong's native products have been in decline, and the sales of silk and flowers are also poor. Grain stores and native product stores, which operate in fresh rice and fresh fruit, suffered heavy losses last summer due to the impact of a sharp decline in prices. When the largest cotton warehouse, Dongxing Huahang, went bankrupt, it owed the market 80,000 to 90,000 yuan, resulting in Jinan's facade of strength hiding a fragile core for several years, which has reached a critical point. In addition, due to the impact of the situation, various banks have adopted a tightening policy on lending. Not only are new loans not being made, but old loans are being pressed for repayment. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has repeatedly requested the Department of Finance to order various banks to continue lending to maintain the situation. Otherwise, half of the city's shops will face the risk of bankruptcy during the lunar New Year. The Department of Finance consulted with various banks, and the banks agreed to jointly contribute 2 million yuan with the money shops to form a loan committee. However, after asking the various head offices for instructions, the head offices ordered that borrowers must borrow from the banks through the Provincial Bank, and the amount was reduced to 1.5 million yuan. However, the Chamber of Commerce did not accept this method and still requested the Department of Finance to handle the matter as previously discussed. The Department of Finance believed that the various banks and silver shops were in Jinan and were interdependent and could not shirk responsibility. It drafted various loan methods and methods for disposing of collateral to ensure the safety of the capital of the lenders, submitted them to the provincial government for approval, and ordered various banks and money shops to handle the matter according to the previous plan. Although the Gregorian New Year has passed recently, the Lunar New Year is approaching, and various shops are busy soliciting overdue debts, and the market is experiencing extremely tight credit, which is causing great difficulty. At times of dispute, those with property and goods have nowhere to borrow. Of those who have the ability to repay, only two or three out of ten. If there is no further relief, there will be many who cannot support themselves and declare bankruptcy. Therefore, on the morning of the 10th, the Department of Finance convened a meeting of the Bank of China, Central Bank, Communications Bank, Minsheng Bank, and other banks, as well as the Silver Industry Association. Although the Donglai Bank, Shiye Bank, Continental Bank, and Shanghai Bank stated that they would not participate in the loan group, they were also invited to join the meeting. After everyone arrived, Wang Xiangrong, the Director of the Department of Finance, did not attend due to other matters, and the First Section Chief Wang Zaolin and Secretary Director Weng Zhiquan attended, explaining the recent alarming situation of Jinan's commerce. If there is no relief method, it is bound to bring down many. Regarding the loan issue, the Chamber of Commerce and various industry associations will investigate, set full guarantees, and organize a loan review committee to review. The Department of Finance, fearing that the banks could not repay the loans to the borrowers and that difficulties would arise when disposing of the collateral, also drafted methods for disposing of the collateral, ensuring that the loan was extremely solid. The silver shops and banks are all in Jinan, weathering the storm together, and should help each other to tide over this difficult time. Although the various banks and silver shops were extremely touched, they had real difficulties and requested that the loan amount be reduced to 1.5 million yuan. It was decided that the Bank of China, Central Bank, Communications Bank, and Minsheng Bank would each contribute 250,000 yuan, and the Silver Industry Association would contribute 100,000 yuan, for a total of 1.1 million yuan, to be lent out first. If it is still insufficient, the Donglai Bank, Continental Bank, Shiye Bank, and Shanghai Bank will each contribute 100,000 yuan to meet the need. Regarding the collateral, movable property is still the principle, but if the collateral is goods that must be sold in the store and cannot be returned to the bank's warehouse, immovable property can be used as collateral. With the exception of the Minsheng Bank, which is a government bank with unavoidable responsibilities and does not need to ask for instructions, the other banks all said that they still need to telegraph the head office for instructions, detailing the needs of Jinan City and requesting approval, and must reply in the near future, so that the Chamber of Commerce can establish a loan committee and release the money before the Lunar New Year. After the discussion, the meeting adjourned, and the various banks immediately telegraphed the head office for instructions. A reply from the Department of Finance is expected in three to five days. The biggest crisis in commerce is expected to be overcome. (10th)</p>
<h3 id="e73">Shandong Province Plans to Build a Highway from Mengyin, Laiwu, and Fei Counties, but Due to Significant Funding Needs, the Decision is to Postpone the Project <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Southern Shandong is mostly mountainous. The areas around Mengyin, Laiwu, and Fei counties are particularly difficult to traverse. It's not just the precarious mountain paths, but also the complex and winding rivers, causing great hardship for travelers. There's a saying in these two or three counties about "nine mountains, eighteen rivers, and seventy-two gullies," highlighting the difficulty of travel. In past years, banditry was rampant in the mountains, making military suppression challenging, and troop movements were often agonizing. Chairman Han personally inspected these counties and is well aware of the situation. He now plans to take advantage of this winter lull to start road construction. Previously, he instructed the Department of Construction to build a road from Laiwu through Mengyin to Fei County. The Department of Construction sent technician Xu Jingfang to thoroughly survey the route. According to his completed survey report, the road is a total of 335 li long. Besides borrowing the existing motor roads on the sections from Xintai to Mengyin and from Pingyizhen to Fei County, there are still 185 Chinese miles (li) that need to be built. The mountain ridges are undulating, and there are many rivers. The first phase of excavation, along the stone ridges, is estimated to cost 712,360 yuan. Paving 2,000 meters of stone road at Baima Pass would cost 30,000 yuan. The remaining earthwork would be handled by conscripting laborers from the counties. Once the first phase is completed, cars could pass. The second phase involves building 37 relatively large bridges and 114 smaller bridges, with a total cost of materials and labor estimated at 630,200 yuan. The Director of the Department of Construction, Zhang Honglie, has submitted this report to the provincial government for review and action. However, Shandong Province is still recovering from disasters, and the people are impoverished. This section of road, just over 180 li, would require over 1.3 million yuan, making it impossible to complete. The provincial government meeting on the 10th has resolved to postpone the project.

<p>Songjiang: Robbery and Murder of Two Victims</p>
<p>At the home of farmer Qian Jingen, in the Gujiezizhen area of Youchebang, Fengjing, on the evening of the 7th, more than ten bandits suddenly appeared, broke in, and robbed. They demanded the hidden silver but were unsuccessful. The bandits then used grass ropes to strangle the victims, Qian Yugen and his wife, Mrs. Lu. When the victims still refused to reveal the location, they were strangled to death on the spot, their eyes bulging and mouths open, a horrifying sight. The bandits dispersed in a panic. The next day, the Second Sub-Bureau was notified for investigation and then reported it to the local court for inspection. It is learned that the Prosecutor's Office has dispatched a prosecutor to Fengjing for the inspection.</p>
<p>Suzhou: Abuse of Maid Case Continues Hearing Yesterday.</p>
<p>Miss Tan Huizhu from Guangdong, residing at No. 17 Deren Lane, Xingjia Muqiao Road, Shanghai, was sentenced to one year and six months in prison by the Shanghai District Court for abusing her maid. Tan appealed to the Jiangsu High Court, and the trial opened on December 18th of last year. The result was that the case required further investigation, and the court ordered Tan Huizhu to post a written bail of 1,000 yuan before being released. The 11th was the date for the continuation of the trial. The appellant, Tan Huizhu, the maid, Xuejuan, and the second landlord, Wang Kaichang, all reported in at 2:00 PM. At around 3:00 PM, Fang Wen, the presiding judge of the Criminal Division I, along with Judge Si Wen, opened the court for trial. First, according to Tan Huizhu's testimony, the scars on Xuejuan were from burns inflicted by a neighbor named Yadain. This happened on September 5th of last year. The judge asked why she said it was a sore when questioned by the Public Security Bureau before. She replied that she did not know at the time. The court then questioned the second landlord, Wang Kaichang, who stated that he worked at the Aikefa Foreign Firm, leaving in the morning and returning in the evening, so he had no knowledge of the matter. Then Xuejuan was questioned, and she testified that the scars were from burns inflicted by a neighbor named Yadain. The judge asked why she pointed out Tan Huizhu as the one who burned her when questioned by the police officer. She replied that this was not the case. At this point, the court adjourned to the deliberation chamber. The prosecutor then took the stand to present his arguments, and lawyer He Yunqing made a defense on behalf of Tan. The arguments concluded, and a date was set for judgment. Tan Huizhu remained on her original bail, and Xuejuan and Wang Kaichang were ordered to return home.</p>
<p>Jiading: A Large Number of Refugees Disturb the Western Countryside</p>
<p>On the 7th, hundreds of refugees from the Tianfu Temple area of Kunshan County entered the western border of this county. In Hongjia Village, Tangqiaobang, and other places southwest of Wangxian Bridge in the Fourth District, they broke into people's homes,抢劫米粮,拐鷄打鴨, and caused great disturbance. The Wangxianqiao Township Office reported this to the Public Security Bureau, which ordered officers to go and suppress the situation. The refugees then turned back west and spent the night in Anting Town before leaving the county on the 8th.</p>
<p>Wuxi: The Truth Behind the Dasongfen Bloodshed Case is Revealed</p>
<p>On the morning of the 5th, a murder case was discovered at Dasongfen Tomb outside the south gate of Xiyi. The deceased was named Lin Yusheng, and his wife, Chen Ada, was only seventeen years old but quite promiscuous, almost anyone could sleep with her. She had affairs with her husband's brothers, Lin A'er and Lin Hesheng. This time, after Jinsheng was killed, the diligent investigation by his friend Shen Yongmao and the detectives led to Chen Ada being suspected of murder and taken into custody by the County Public Security Bureau for questioning. Lin Hesheng, the deceased's brother, was also considered a prime suspect and was also taken into custody at the same time. Bloodstains were found on the corner of Lin Hesheng's cotton robe and on his shoe uppers, which were identical in color to the blood at the scene of the crime. Therefore, he was placed under strict surveillance. Later, based on a tip, Lin A'er, a cousin of the deceased, was suspected of being an accomplice. The county detective team, accompanied by Shen Yongmao, went to the countryside and arrested Lin A'er on the way to Liqiao. After being brought to the city, they were interrogated separately. According to their confessions, both Lin A'er and Lin Hesheng had affairs with Ada. Hesheng wanted to be husband and wife with Ada for a long time, so he conspired with A'er and bought a sugar cane peeling knife for 150 yuan at Chong'an Temple. On the evening of the tenth day of the lunar calendar, Hesheng, together with A'er and the deceased, Jinsheng, drank wine in a hotel outside the south gate. They first got Jinsheng drunk. When they walked to the vicinity of Zhangyuan Temple, Jinsheng fell into the river. The two helped him up and took off his wet cotton robe. By the time they reached Dasongfen Tomb, Jinsheng could no longer walk and sat on a dirt pile. Hesheng first used the knife to stab Jinsheng in the neck, and then A'er held Jinsheng down and stabbed him twice more. Seeing that he was dead, they threw the knife into the pond and fled to Qingqi's house to sleep. Chen Ada also confessed that she had affairs with a soldier, her cousin Lin Shengbao, and her husband's brother Lin Hesheng. Hesheng told her that he planned to kill Jinsheng and then take her as his wife. Thus, the truth of the case has been revealed. Chief Inspector Wang ordered them to be closely guarded and then transferred to the county court for trial.</p>
<p>Long-distance bus accident</p>
<p>Jiangzhen: People from Gaobao Come to the Province to Petition</p>
<p>The Qingyang long-distance bus No. 1208 of the Jiangsu Provincial Highway Administration, traveling from north to south at 2:00 PM on the 6th, passed through the Fengshen Temple Qigong Hall on the Yun Causeway outside the west gate of Gaoyou City. The terrain was dangerous. The driver of the bus, due to careless driving, overturned into the Grand Canal. There were about 30 passengers in the bus, all of whom fell into the water. Neighboring residents of that section of the canal rescued more than a dozen men and women, but eight people drowned, a tragic scene. This caused opposition from the citizens of Gaoyou, and the Standing Committee Member of the Baoying County Party Department, Ji Xiaonan, together with more than ten citizens from Gaoyou County, including Xia Yuhua, brought a petition to the province. They arrived in the province at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 10th and petitioned the Provincial Government and the Department of Construction. The petition is recorded as follows: "The Jiangbei Yangqing Highway allows buses to pass, and the Yangshao section temporarily uses small transport. The route starts from Qingjiang and ends at Shaobo, along the Grand Canal, a long embankment of more than 300 li. The rapid land transportation relies solely on buses. As for the lack of vehicles and crowded passengers, we will not dwell on that. However, in less than a month, tragedies have occurred one after another. One overturned in a culvert in Liujiabao, but fortunately, a wooden bridge blocked it, preventing a major disaster. Half a month ago, a pedestrian was crushed to death north of Jieshou. The most tragic was on the 6th of this month, when a southbound bus overturned at the Qigong Hall outside the west gate of Gaoyou, with 30 passengers, and only 7 survivors. Only eight corpses have been recovered, and the whereabouts of the others are unknown. Whether they are alive or dead, their families have no news. Who doesn't have parents who fear for their longevity? Who doesn't have children who rely on them? Even if they are not husband and wife, they are as respectful as friends. Who doesn't have brothers who are as close as limbs? How can the living bear this? We believe that highways should facilitate passengers, but now they have become instruments of murder, with life in danger and uncertainty. Thinking of this, we are filled with fear. The citizens live in Gaoshi, in the middle section of the highway, and what we see and hear is heartbreaking. Everyone has compassion, and we believe that Your Excellency cares deeply. Hearing of this tragedy, how can you not be saddened? How should we plan for safety and protect the lives of passengers to avoid future accidents? We respectfully request that Your Excellency convene representatives from each county along the route for open discussion, to determine how bus drivers should be strictly screened, how routes should be revised, and how funding should be统筹, with careful consideration to ensure safety. Developing transportation and eliminating dangers will not only benefit the passengers of our two counties, but will also bring life to ten thousand families. In addition to submitting this petition directly to the Provincial Government, we respectfully submit this document, hoping that Your Excellency will review and implement it. Respectfully presented to the Chairman of the Provincial Government, Chen, and the Director of the Department of Construction, Shen."</p>
<p>Nantong: Mediation of the Dasheng Subsidiary Factory Dispute</p>
<p>The Dasheng Yarn Factory subsidiary factory in Jiangjiaqiao has been in a dispute for half a year due to the dismissal of employees. The Nantong District Administrative Inspector's Office ordered the Nantong County Magistrate Jin on the 10th to investigate and handle the matter together with the County Party Department, citing that during the period of martial law, the labor and management should not dispute and cause trouble, and to resolve the matter within three days. If the two sides still dispute and find it difficult to resolve, a proposed solution should be submitted for mandatory execution.</p>
<p>Ningbo: Bandit Zhou Xiaosheng and his gang from Xiangshan surrender.</p>
<p>The bandit gang of Zhou Xiaosheng in Xiangshan has been a problem in the area for a long time. Although the military and police have been cracking down, they have been unable to eliminate the root of the problem. In December of last year, the bandit leader Zhou Xiaosheng repented and wanted to surrender to the Xiangshan County Government, requesting that nearby township heads come to negotiate. The Xiangshan County Government reported this to the Provincial Security Command for approval. However, the matter was suspended because the guarantee issue had not been resolved. Now, the County Magistrate of Hai County, Hu Dingren, in order to eliminate banditry, has decided to personally go to western Xiangshan on the 12th, or send someone there, to negotiate the matter with the township heads. After this, the banditry in western Xiangshan may be eliminated.</p>

<h3 id="e76">Rong Zongjing Contributes Suggestions for Revitalizing Agriculture and Industry, Promoting Wheat Fields and Cotton Fields. <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the topic of President Jiang's speech on New Year's Day at the Central Broadcasting Station was "The National Way to Self-Help and Saving the Country." The program in the speech included the New Life Movement and the National Economic Construction Movement. The implementation requirements and methods of the National Economic Construction Movement included eight items. If these are done conscientiously, it is definitely an easy task. Shanghai industrial tycoon Rong Zongjing has some suggestions for the first item, revitalizing agriculture, and the fifth item, promoting industry. He presented them to President Jiang of the Executive Yuan and Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry. He said, "I have been engaged in the flour and textile industries for more than 30 years. Food and clothing are the basic needs of people's lives, and the raw materials for the flour and textile industries are all agricultural products. Therefore, the revitalization of agriculture is closely related to people's food and clothing. The wheat produced in our country each year is not enough for the mechanized flour mills in the country for half a year, and the Maoxin Fuxin Flour Mills that I founded need more than 10 million祖. When there is a shortage of wheat, to maintain the people's food and the livelihood of workers, we have to purchase foreign wheat to supply the mills. Our country has many places suitable for growing wheat. Instead of relying on others, why not produce enough for ourselves? We should promote wheat fields and plant them in time, so that the output will increase year by year, reaching 100 million担, so that there is no fear of supply falling short of demand. As for the cotton production in our country, the numbers have been increasing in the past ten years. Through active cotton planting, the output has increased to more than 11 million担, but last year there were only more than 8 million担. Our country has a population of 400 million, and cotton production must increase to 16 million担 to meet the needs of the textile industry and the people. Today, all countries are promoting cotton fields, such as Brazil in South America, which is also increasing its output. Our country has a vast territory and a large population. Without actively planting cotton again, we cannot revive the countryside. This is my opinion on revitalizing agriculture."</p>
<p>President Jiang said, "If industry cannot be developed, material civilization cannot progress, and economic life cannot be satisfactory. Therefore, in addition to vigorously promoting agriculture, forestry, and mining, the most important thing is to strive for the development of industry. The textile industry is the most important industry in our country. The United Kingdom has more than 40 million spindles, India has more than 9 million, the United States has more than 30 million, and Japan has been increasing its spindles year by year. In 1935, it had increased to 10,296,528 spindles. Our country has only 2.5 million spindles, and foreign-owned factories in China have more than 2 million. When new cotton is on the market, many of our country's 2.5 million spindles are still idle. For example, Shenxin No. 2 and No. 5 factories have been shut down for almost a year, and there is no way to find a way to resume production. However, considering the needs of 400 million people, spindles must be promoted. If it is limited by economic and environmental factors, at a minimum, the existing number of spindles should be maintained. If the original number of spindles cannot be maintained, economic aggression cannot be resisted. What is the purpose of developing industry? In my humble opinion, maintaining the current state of the yarn industry is better than reducing interest rates and facilitating transportation. Maintaining the current situation is the only way to seek progress. Otherwise, we are still in the budding stage of the textile industry. If we don't irrigate it and destroy it, there is still hope for survival? This is my opinion on promoting industry. People who run factories now are all downcast and have unspeakable pain. After reading President Jiang's speech, I unconsciously became excited. Speaking from the standpoint of a businessman, I said a few words about my own interests. I don't know if I am right. I still hope that the government and the public will teach me."</p>

<h3 id="e84">The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Requests Negotiations to Stop Japanese Residents from Issuing Paper Money, Which Will Cause Our Country's Newly Reorganized Currency System to Fail Completely and Fall Into a Chaotic Situation. <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce submitted a request to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Finance yesterday, requesting negotiations to stop Japanese residents from issuing paper money in Shanghai. The submission stated, "According to reports, Japanese residents in Shanghai have requested their country to circulate Japanese yen banknotes in Shanghai, with the number temporarily limited to 2 million yuan. All Japanese factories will use these banknotes to pay workers' salaries and purchase goods from Chinese people. It is also heard that Japan has already implemented the scheduled steps one by one. This is a further step compared to the previous rumors that it would only be used among Japanese residents. Although foreign banks in our country's commercial ports have issued banknotes, they have long been gradually withdrawn and are almost extinct. This precedent should not be reopened. Moreover, Japanese yen banknotes are said to be based on gold, which is very different from the banknotes issued by foreign merchants based on silver dollars. This measure is no different from applying the old trick of the gold standard implemented in Dalian to Shanghai, which will cause the achievements of our country's currency system, which has been reorganized in recent years, to fail completely and fall into a chaotic situation. Therefore, we respectfully request that Your Excellency (Ministry) review and approve the matter, and kindly order negotiations to stop it, and at the same time order the Central Bank to properly plan effective preventive measures to ensure complete success, which is extremely urgent."</p>
<h3 id="e85">Jiangda and Xinjiang Vessels Collide the Night Before Last, Both Damaged and Sent to Repair <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The Taikoo Company's Xinjiang vessel, 2,646 tons, arrived in Shanghai from Qingdao and was docked at the company's No. 1 wharf on Xinkai River. It was originally scheduled to load cargo yesterday and sail to Shantou, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou. At around 5 p.m. on the 10th, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Changjiang vessel Jiangda arrived and approached Xinkai River. As the ship's body reached the Jinliyuan Wharf, the acting captain and first mate, Xin Shaoqin, immediately turned the ship around there, preparing to berth at the wharf, and dropped anchor first. At this time, the Ningbo line vessels Xin Beijing and Xin Ningshao were coming up behind the Jiangda, causing the Jiangda vessel to reverse, unable to move backward, because reversing would cause a major disaster by colliding with Xin Ningshao. As a result, the bow of the Jiangda vessel collided with the Taikoo Xinjiang vessel. The bow of the Jiangda hit the stern of the Xinjiang, and both sides were damaged.</p>
<p>Damage Situation: The Xinjiang vessel is a sea-going vessel with extremely strong steel plates. The bow of the Jiangda vessel hit the right stern cabin of the Xinjiang vessel, damaging the seventh longitudinal stringer and bending the iron plate. As for the cement and wooden planks used to reinforce the bow of the Jiangda vessel, they were also completely destroyed. After the accident, the acting owner of the Jiangda, Zhe Shaoqin, went to the Xinjiang vessel to inspect the damage together. It was not until yesterday morning that the Maritime Affairs Bureau and the insurance company were notified, requesting technicians to inspect the damage so that repairs could be made at the shipyard.</p>
<p>Two Ships Enter the Shipyard: The Xinjiang vessel was originally scheduled to sail to Nanhua today, but since it was hit and damaged, after inspection by the insurance company and the Customs Port Affairs Office yesterday afternoon, it was sent to the Jiangnan Shipyard in the afternoon to enter the dock for repairs. It will take more than a day or two to complete the work. The company has reassigned another ship to replace it on the Nanhua run. The Jiangda vessel was also inspected yesterday afternoon and is scheduled to enter the shipyard for repairs today. It will take at least four or five days to complete the repairs.</p>
<p>Shipowner's Report: Xin Shaoqin, the acting owner of the Jiangda, reported to the General Office yesterday, saying that the Jiangda vessel dropped anchor and turned around to berth at the wharf due to wind direction and tidal conditions, causing a collision with the Xinjiang vessel. He stated that at 3:04 p.m. on the 10th, the Jiangda vessel entered the Wusong Estuary. After the ship passed the Meifu Petroleum Depot, it slowed down. When it reached Lujiazui, it changed to allow the green light to pass, waiting for the Xin Beijing vessel to exit. When it arrived at the Taikoo Wharf, it discovered a tugboat exiting from the alley. Because the Suiyang vessel was berthed at the buoy in that port, and the Xinjiang vessel was also docked at the Xinkai River Taikoo High Wharf, the vessel took the middle alley forward. When it passed the Suiyang, it stopped at 5:05 p.m., close to the stern of the ship, turned to the starboard and dropped anchor, quickly reversing, intending to berth at the Xinkai River China Merchants Wharf. However, at that time, the northeast wind was rising, and although the anchor was dropped and the car was reversed, it had little effect, and the bow of the ship drifted toward the Xinjiang vessel. At the same time, the Xin Ningshao vessel was sailing past the stern of the vessel. During the turning, it collided with the Xinjiang vessel. Subsequently, the vessel berthed at the wharf. He and the first and second mates immediately boarded the Xinjiang vessel to inspect and saw that the seventh transverse stringer was damaged. The bow of the vessel was also damaged. Therefore, the circumstances were reported. (The following is omitted.)</p>
<h3 id="e86">The Changjiang Six Vessels Distribute Water Transport Expenses Proportionately, Continued Handling After Expiration, Contract Terms Slightly Revised <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Due to the scarcity of cargo transportation on the Changjiang River last year, the six shipping companies, including Nissin and Ningshao, repeatedly lowered water transport prices, competing to take on cargo. This not only sharply reduced revenue but also affected the survival of the entire shipping industry. Therefore, in July, they jointly convened a meeting to standardize water transport prices and implement a proportional distribution system, hiring Thomson Accountants as consultants and setting up an office at No. 2 Guangdong Road. The initial contract was signed for a trial period of six months, which will expire at the end of this month. The reporter inquired there yesterday and learned that since the implementation of proportional distribution of water transport expenses, the results have been good. After the expiration, in addition to slightly revising the terms of the original contract, the decision was made to continue handling it. It is reported that the validity period is still six months, and each shipping company may not withdraw midway until the expiration.</p>

<p>After the establishment of the bank clearing house, it has achieved considerable results. In addition to negotiating with the Money Trade Joint Reserve to collect money shop bills on its behalf, it has also added entrusted agency exchange notices, and business will continue as usual on Sundays. Details are recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Entrusted Agency: The Bank Joint Reserve Committee's clearing position is full and no additional desks can be added. It is specifically stipulated that any member bank of the industry association that is unable to join as a clearing bank due to the limited space in the clearing house may entrust the association to act as its clearing agent. Currently, there are a total of thirty-eight clearing houses. Those who have entrusted the Bank Joint Reserve Committee are: (A) Zhejiang Local Bank, (B) Sichuan Meifeng Bank, (C) Jiangsu Farmers Bank, (D) China Farmers Bank, (E) Yongda Bank. The above have all been implemented.</p>
<p>Business as Usual on Sundays: The clearing house's notice reads, in brief, that the industry association, upon the recommendation of the association, has already stipulated that from this year onwards, all branches of each bank in the city will be closed all day on Sundays. The chaotic habits have been transformed into a neat and uniform new regulation, which is a deeply gratifying event this year. However, at present, the money trade industry has not been able to implement this uniformly. Therefore, the association's collection of bills on Sundays must still be handled as usual.</p>

<h3 id="e93">The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau Strictly Prohibits Smoking and Intensifies Investigation and Arrest Work, Many Opium Dens and Smokers Have Been Cracked Down on in Recent Days, The Drug Rehabilitation Hospital Has Increased Bed Capacity to Accommodate <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, after the registration of smokers ended at the end of last year, began this year to compile a register and classify statistics, and the work of investigating and arresting smokers is becoming increasingly tense. In the past ten days, many opium dens and smokers have been cracked down on. The number of people in the existing drug rehabilitation hospital has increased sharply, and special beds have been added to accommodate them. The details are recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Total Number of Registered Smokers Announced</p>
<p>The Public Security Bureau announced yesterday that the total number of registered smokers from July 1 to the end of December was 30,634, including 12,686 with ordinary licenses, 17,940 with poor people's licenses, and 8 with travel licenses, collecting a total of 74,218 yuan in license fees. In addition, 4,041 people were unable to obtain licenses and applied for abstinence, and 2,873 people had been discharged from the hospital after abstinence. The statistical breakdown of smokers' ages, occupations, and addresses is currently being compiled. Smokers' ages are mostly between 45 and 55, occupations are mostly coolies, and addresses are mostly in the Lao Beimen Yimiao area. At the same time, the Public Security Bureau Water Patrol Team announced that a total of 6,207 households had guaranteed that there were no smoking boat crews.</p>
<p>Opium Dens and Smokers: Many Cracked Down On</p>
<p>Since the bureau's investigation and arrest unit adopted the method of rewarding informers and joint investigations, the land and water investigations and arrests have become increasingly tense. The bureau's detective team and the police officers of the smoker registration section have been dispatched day and night, and in recent days, they have arrested more than 800 male and female smokers. About 90 private opium dens have also been cracked down on. Lao Beimen, Xin Zha, Shiliupu, Yimiao, Hengfeng Road, Menggu Road, and Ximen Branches have all made breakthroughs. In addition, the bureau recently found a recidivist smoker, Bao Zuojun, at No. 24 Hongyun Lane, Yuezhou Road, who had been rehabilitated by the bureau. He was ordered to rehabilitate again and was sent to the Songhu Garrison Command for strict legal action yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>Drug Rehabilitation Hospital: Increased Bed Capacity</p>
<p>The Municipal Central Drug Rehabilitation Hospital, which was jointly planned by the Public Security Bureau and the Health Bureau, cannot be established immediately due to funding and layout reasons. However, on the Public Security Bureau's side, the drug rehabilitation work cannot be delayed due to the congestion of drug addicts and those waiting to be sent to the hospital for abstinence. Therefore, it was decided to add beds and use double-layer beds in the existing North and South Municipal Drug Rehabilitation Hospitals, the Drug Rehabilitation Hospital for Criminals in Caohejing, and the Longhua Drug Rehabilitation Center. The original number of beds in Shanghai South was 100, which has been increased to 180. The original number of beds in Shanghai North was 250, which has been increased to 500. The original number of beds in the Criminal Drug Rehabilitation Center was 100, which has been increased to 200. The original number of beds in the Provisional Drug Rehabilitation Center was 100, which has been increased to 200. Currently, the total number of beds in each hospital has been increased to 1,080, which is temporarily enough to accommodate them.</p>
<p>Drug Rehabilitation Hospital: Strictly Limited Fees</p>
<p>The city's anti-smoking authorities, in order to limit the excessive fees charged by temporary drug rehabilitation hospitals, have specially formulated measures for the management and designation of hospitals to undertake temporary drug rehabilitation work in the city, strictly limiting and regulating the fees. It is now known that this has been approved by the Municipal Government's instructions. The fees charged by each hospital for drug rehabilitation patients are as follows: (A) First-class ward, 4 to 6 yuan per person per day, including meals and medical expenses; (B) Second-class ward, 2 to 3 yuan per person per day, including meals and medical expenses; (C) Third-class ward, a total of 1 yuan per day, including meals and medical expenses; (D) All injectable drugs and supplements may be discussed with the drug rehabilitation patients by each hospital separately and charged separately. Drug rehabilitation patients must be hospitalized for abstinence and may not be discharged freely. The Municipal Public Security and Health Bureaus may, at any time, transfer people who have been rehabilitated by each hospital to the Municipal Drug Rehabilitation Agency for verification.</p>
<p>Anti-Smoking Committee: Compiles and Prints Special Publication</p>
<p>The Municipal Anti-Smoking Committee, with the completion of smoker registration, the anti-smoking work can be declared to have come to an end. A special publication on anti-smoking has been compiled, which compiles various materials. In addition to photos of Chairman Chiang, Mayor Wu, and members of the committee, the text includes Wang Xiaolai's publication preface, Du Yuesheng's "The Anti-Smoking Problem in Shanghai," Cai Bubai's "My Views on Anti-Smoking," Deng Qingshan's "The Principles of Opium Addiction and Anti-Smoking Methods," as well as the various anti-smoking and anti-drug laws and regulations promulgated by the Military Affairs Committee's headquarters, and the committee's anti-smoking efforts. It is quite complete and will be distributed to all sectors of society to facilitate anti-smoking propaganda.</p>

<p>Luo Xiangfu, 40 years old, from Yancheng, is a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner, lives in Pudong, and once had a traditional Chinese medicine license issued by the Municipal Health Bureau. Since he held the kettle, no one cared about him, so he was down on his luck. Recently, he had a whimsical idea and set up a dentist stall at the Yuhang Bridge embankment in the city without authorization, using the traditional Chinese medicine license to deceive people and extract teeth for treatment. A few days ago, Huang Genquan, a resident of Hai, who runs an ocean iron shop at No. 111 Laobaidu Street, (27 years old) sought Luo for treatment because of toothache. Luo said that the painful tooth must be extracted and stated that it would cost 40 cents. Unexpectedly, the pain became more severe after the extraction. He immediately went home to sleep. When he looked in the mirror yesterday, he unexpectedly found that the extracted tooth was a good tooth. So he was extremely angry and ran to Luo to negotiate, demanding the return of the extraction fee and compensation for the good tooth. Luo refused, resulting in an argument. The beat police Liu Fangqiu arrived and took him to the Yimiao Police Station. After questioning, Liu So feared that Luo Xiangfu had a traditional Chinese medicine license, not a dentist, and should not extract teeth for others. Now that Huang Genquan claimed that his good teeth had been extracted, causing severe pain, he was sent to the Public Security Bureau for legal action, he said.</p>

<p>According to Xinxin News Agency, the construction of the Shanghai Qiujiang Wharf is of great importance to the prosperity of the central area of Shanghai. Since the Central Trust Bureau specially formed the Qiujiang Wharf Construction Committee to undertake the construction project, the project has progressed rapidly. A total of 272 mu of land in the Kunlian Wharf has been requisitioned as a base for building warehouses and other facilities. The wharf warehouse project was won by the Innovation Factory and is currently under active construction, with a total cost of more than 440,000 yuan. The wharf filling project and the heightening of the requisitioned land have been entrusted to the Dredging Bureau for separate implementation. Negotiations have also been completed with the municipal government to build Wuquan Road in front of the wharf to facilitate transportation, which is scheduled to begin construction within days. According to a reporter from the Xinxin News Agency who learned from the Qiujiang Wharf Construction Committee, the entire wharf project can be fully completed around September this year.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Divine Shoal Dredging Project Scheduled for Completion in Five Years; Beacon Installation to Commence Night Work Immediately; Another Dredger to Be Built; Construction Ship's Superintendent to Be Replaced Upon Completion of Term <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>According to a Datong News Agency reporter's continued inquiries with the Whangpoo Conservancy Board regarding the dredging of the Divine Shoal outside the Wusong Estuary, night and day dredging will soon commence. Simultaneously, the large dredger designed by the Board will be put out for bids for construction, with a deadline of one and a half years for completion, to facilitate the Divine Shoal dredging project. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Glimpses of the Dredging Work</p>
<p>The Divine Shoal is located approximately thirty English miles northeast of the Wusong Estuary, at the center of the Yangtze River estuary, a vital navigational route. Since the arrival in Shanghai of the "Construction" dredger, ordered from Germany in April of last year, it has been dredging the shoal. The planned initial dredging program covers an area 20 miles long and 1,000 feet wide, deepening the water from 15 feet at low tide to 21.5 feet, removing approximately 20 million tons of soil. Currently, sections such as the Lanjiang Shoal have been initially dredged, with approximately 700,000 tons of soil removed from the dredging area. Including soil removed outside the designated area, the total exceeds one million tons.</p>
<p>Change of Ship's Superintendent</p>
<p>To accelerate the dredging work, the Board will soon initiate night work. However, the dredging area is a busy waterway, and to prevent collisions and other dangers, they are currently consulting with the Customs Maritime Department to install long-range floating beacon lights. Night work will commence once these beacon lights are installed. Simultaneously, the Board's dredging plan is scheduled for five years, requiring two large dredgers. Therefore, the construction of another dredger is urgent. The Chief Engineer has completed the design, and bids for construction will be solicited soon. Furthermore, it is understood that the superintendent of the "Construction" dredger, an experienced professional, was dispatched by the German Schichau shipyard. However, his term is only one year, which has now expired. The Board is currently searching for a suitable replacement.</p>

<p>Xu Yizeng, age 31, a local native and manager of the Hongyun Photography Studio at 82 Pintang Lane, Nanjing Road, whose wife, Ms. Zhu, was approximately four months pregnant, felt unwell and went to see Yu Zuotang, an expert in gynecology practicing traditional Chinese medicine at 72 Guanbao Lane, Xiangfen Lane, Nanjing Road, on November 19th of last year. After examination, Yu diagnosed her with amenorrhea, not pregnancy, and prescribed medication to promote menstruation. The prescription consisted entirely of surface-acting remedies. However, after Ms. Zhu took the medicine, her condition not only failed to improve but worsened. She returned for a follow-up consultation on the 22nd, but Yu insisted it was amenorrhea and prescribed medicine to regulate the surface. Ms. Zhu took it as prescribed. Unexpectedly, after taking the medicine, she experienced severe abdominal pain and heavy bleeding, leading to unconsciousness and the miscarriage of the four-month-old fetus. She was rushed to another doctor, who diagnosed the error made by Yu Zuotang. Therefore, the miscarried fetus was preserved in alcohol to prevent decay. She then engaged lawyers Shen Zongyong and Wang Shouan to file a lawsuit in the Criminal Division of the First Special District Court, accusing Yu Zuotang of abortion and requesting that he be punished under Article 291, Section 1 of the Criminal Code and ordered to pay substantial damages. After an initial hearing by the First Special District Court, a continued hearing was held yesterday afternoon in the Second Criminal Court by Judge Jiang Shuzi. Xu Yizeng presented the fetus, preserved in an alcohol-filled bottle, to the court, while Yu engaged lawyer Xiao Zhuanding for his defense. The plaintiff's lawyer, to ensure fairness, requested the court to submit the fetus for expert evaluation. Judge Jiang instructed Xu Nengwu to pay ten yuan for the evaluation fee. Xu agreed to pay. The court then adjourned the hearing pending the results of the evaluation.</p>

<p>Qian Chenglong, a detective inspector, Zhou Bingcheng, a scout, and Greulich (transliteration), a Western detective inspector, along with detectives Li Liansheng and Le Sixiang, were patrolling Pingji Li Road at noon on the 10th when they spotted a suspicious-looking man between Lafayette Road and Boer Road. The man was carrying a paper package. Upon seeing the detectives approaching, he threw the package on the ground and fled. The detectives picked up the package, opened it, and found it full of new banknotes. They immediately gave chase and apprehended the man at the intersection of Lafayette Road and Annakin Road. They brought him back to the police station, where they examined the banknotes in detail and found them to be counterfeit one-yuan notes of the old version issued by the Bank of China, totaling eight hundred yuan. The man identified himself as Yao Yunqi, 28 years old, from Nanhui, Pudong, a coppersmith residing at No. 16 Shipipi Lane in the city. He stated that a woman on Pingji Li Road had given him the banknotes to deliver, and that the woman was following him but escaped when he was arrested. Yesterday morning, the police sent Yao, along with the counterfeit banknotes, to the Second Special District Court for questioning. Judge Li Changnian and Clerk Wang Baoxun conducted the preliminary hearing in the First Criminal Court at 11:00 AM. Gu Shouxi, the lawyer from the Police Department, described the arrest and stated that the police had discovered that the defendant was previously arrested on September 10, 1931, also for counterfeiting banknotes. However, the court found insufficient evidence and acquitted him. Because the Police Department still needed to investigate the case in detail and apprehend the accomplices who were still at large, they requested an extension of one week to detain the defendant while the case was investigated. The lawyer submitted the counterfeit banknotes as evidence. Yao Yunqi testified that around 10:00 PM on the 9th of this month, an acquaintance, Qian Zhixiang, told him to go to the Yuanyuan Teahouse at No. 148 Boer Road the next morning for tea. When he arrived at the teahouse on time, he met Qian and his friend Jin Yusheng. They told him that Jin's wife had a package of "fancy paper" that she wanted him to deliver to a guest at the Nanyang Restaurant on Boer Road and that he would be paid ten yuan. He went downstairs, walked north along Pingji Li Road, and about thirty storefronts down, a woman approached him and gave him the package. The woman followed behind him, and when he was arrested, she escaped. He claimed he did not know the package contained counterfeit banknotes.

<p>The First Special District Court, in adjudicating opium and drug cases, should follow the Ministry of Justice's directive and abide by the anti-drug and anti-opium regulations promulgated by the Superintendent-General for the Suppression of Opium. However, due to the unique circumstances of the concessions, this has not yet been implemented. Recently, after discussions between President Guo Yuntao of the court and the Public Works Department, it was originally decided that, starting from the 11th of this month, all opium and drug cases apprehended by the various police stations would be prosecuted by the Public Works Department in accordance with the anti-drug and anti-opium regulations. However, after receiving the court's notification, the Public Works Department realized that the regulations were written entirely in Chinese, which the foreign police officers in the various police stations did not understand. Therefore, it was difficult to apply them immediately. The regulations now need to be translated into English so that the foreign police officers can thoroughly understand the text before they can be invoked in cases to avoid discrepancies. Therefore, a considerable period of time is required to make the necessary arrangements, and the original implementation date of the 11th has had to be postponed.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Zhang Wu vs. Xie Lianqing: Litigation Arises Over Management of Estate <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Accountant's Audit Reveals Discrepancies; Judge Instructs Defendant's Lawyer to Take Responsibility</p>
<p>Zhang Wu, a woman from Ningbo, residing at No. 2 Tangshan Road, engaged lawyers Xiang Xun and Peng Yuanxun in December of last year to file a lawsuit with the Criminal Division of the District Court, accusing Xie Lianqing, from Zhenhai, Ningbo, residing at No. 1 Qinganfang, Guangqi Road, of intentional misappropriation of estate funds under her management, requesting a legal investigation to uphold justice, along with a private prosecution. The lawsuit stated that her late husband, Yan Zhong, unfortunately passed away in September 1926 due to illness. Because the plaintiff's sons were still minors, the Zhang Xiafang Estate Management Committee was organized by fellow villagers and friends, with the defendant Xie Lianqing serving as an executive member, stationed at the Hengchangxiang Clock and Machine Shipbuilding Factory founded by the deceased husband. All of the deceased husband's assets were under the defendant's control. Last year, the plaintiff, seeing that the various businesses were facing financial difficulties, entrusted accountant Huang Bingzhang to audit the accounts. The plaintiff discovered that the defendant had intentionally enriched herself at the expense of others, taking advantage of her position as estate manager to sell the real estate on the Bund without authorization. According to the accountant's report, there was a discrepancy of 64,266.66 taels of silver, and evidence of breaches of trust and misappropriation was numerous. The defendant was indeed guilty and had no defense. The plaintiff requested a thorough investigation. The court accepted the lawsuit and ordered a preliminary hearing, resulting in the defendant Xie Lianqing being released on bail pending further instructions. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Judge Chen Jingyi specially opened the 12th courtroom for a continued hearing. The plaintiff Zhang Wu, accompanied by lawyers Xiang and Peng, appeared in court. The defendant Xie Lianqing also engaged lawyer Wang Luqing to defend her. Lawyer Peng stated that the accountant Huang Bingzhang, who was summoned to testify, had gone to Hangzhou Electric Power Company to audit accounts on the 4th of this month, and would return to Shanghai in a few days. He requested the court to postpone the hearing. The defendant's lawyer also requested that the court summon four witnesses, including Dong Xingsheng, to protect the defendant's legal interests. The judge, after reviewing the arguments, instructed the defendant's lawyer: "The defendant must bear a certain responsibility in this case. The criminal charges cannot be withdrawn. However, regarding the civil aspects, it is permissible to seek a settlement with the plaintiff outside the court." The court granted a postponement for a consolidated hearing. Xie Lianqing remained released on the original bail, and because the guarantor was not present, lawyer Wang was responsible for ensuring her release.</p>

Neighbors followed and apprehended one of the accomplices, who was handed over to the police for investigation. The injured man was rushed to the Sacred Heart Hospital by police ambulance for treatment.</p>

<p>Zhang Xu, a young woman from Nanxun, due to her husband's poverty and illness, voluntarily went to a job placement agency near Baxianqiao in September of last year to seek employment as a servant. The owner of the agency, seeing her youth and vulnerability, colluded with Xu Wang, a pimp at No. 42 Nanjing Road, and Li Meili, at No. 6 Le Yu Li, to sell the woman to Qiu Yongnian, a pimp at No. 10 Huile Li, Yunnan Road, for prostitution. The woman seized an opportunity to escape and reported the incident to the police, who arrested the three pimps, including Xu Wang, and remanded them to the First Special District Court. The court ordered Xu Wang to post bail, while Li and Qiu were detained pending investigation. As reported previously, after being released on bail, Xu Wang immediately notified the owner of the job placement agency near Baxianqiao to go into hiding. When the police sent detectives to investigate the agency, the owner had already disappeared. When the police went to Qiu Yongnian's home to investigate, Qiu's four prostitutes, known as Lao Qi, Lao Ba, Da Nv, and Qiao Yun, had also fled. It was suspected that Xu Wang had forewarned them. This morning, Judge Zhan continued the hearing. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian requested the revocation of Xu Wang's bail to avoid hindering the ongoing investigation. The defendant Qiu Yongnian still engaged Jiang Yiping as his lawyer, who claimed that Zhang Xu used to work as a waitress at the Little World Entertainment Center and that this was a setup. The court questioned the three defendants and ordered them to be detained separately pending further hearing.</p>

<p>The restaurant industry sent a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce stating: "We respectfully inform you that our members, including Tian Hongyun Restaurant and others, have reported that the restaurant business in the city is sluggish, with most operating at a loss and barely managing to survive. Moreover, all restaurants have been affected by the group weddings organized by the city government. Regarding the collection of aviation donations, at a meeting convened on April 30, 1935, by the Shanghai Recruiting Team of the China Aviation Association, our chairman, representing the industry, expressed the opinion that due to the poor economic climate, the implementation should be postponed. Furthermore, we discovered that the China Aviation Association did not notify our association of the meeting convened for the restaurant industry. Since the publication of the news that the aviation donation would be levied starting January 15, 1936, members have been inquiring and feel helpless. Although it is collected from customers, it inevitably affects our business. Therefore, we respectfully request that your chamber review the situation and forward this letter to the head office of the Shanghai Recruiting Team of the China Aviation Association, taking into account the difficulties of businesses and postponing the levy to ease public sentiment and show compassion. We sincerely appreciate your cooperation."</p>

<p>The Second Special District Citizens' United Association, First District Branch, regarding the matter of the Lao Qing He Silver Store on Bubbling Well Road being cut off from electricity by the French Municipal Council for levying donations for lights and signs, sent a letter to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession yesterday, requesting negotiation. The original letter is excerpted as follows: Respected Sirs,</p>
<p>According to a letter from our member store, Lao Qing He Silver Store, located at 152 Bubbling Well Road, stating that on January 3rd of this year, they received a letter from the French Municipal Council, translated as saying, "We hereby notify you that your store must pay the light and sign donation of forty-two yuan for 1935 before December 31st, otherwise water and electricity will be cut off, (Note) the store was established more than twenty years ago, and has been installed for two years, without any notice of donation. Now the Municipal Council is extremely distressed by this commercial disruption, which cannot be afforded. They were preparing to present reasons and request the bureau to negotiate, but suddenly on the 9th of this month, the electricity was cut off, resulting in darkness and inability to do business. Therefore, they request your association to provide prompt relief, that is, to increase donations and taxes, and especially to use unreasonable power outages as a means of coercion, which is a great loss of the original intention of maintaining commerce. According to the previous situation in the letter, it is reasonable to send a letter to your association, preside over justice, and seriously negotiate with the French Municipal Council to restore the electricity of the store, and to argue with reason against the exorbitant donations, to achieve the purpose of canceling the donations, to appease merchants and people, and to avoid public dissatisfaction.</p>

Two of them, holding guns, broke into Yang's house and, without asking questions, shot at Yang and Lü, who were wounded and fell to the ground. The police arrived at the scene after hearing the news, but the murderers had disappeared without a trace. An ambulance was summoned to the scene to fly Yang and Lü to Baolong Hospital for treatment. The Gordons Road Police Station ordered Chief Detective Gao Huiguang and others to investigate.

Therefore, the detective immediately detained Yang's wife, Ms. Jin, and sent her to the First Special Court, requesting detention. Rescue was ineffective, and she died. The corpse was taken to the Phélan Road autopsy room. Although Yang suffered abdominal injuries, there was no danger to his life. Yesterday morning, Tang Prosecutor of the First Special Court, accompanied by forensic doctor Zhang Yan, clerk Wang Zuyi, etc., went to the morgue to verify the corpse. Ms. someone, the wife of the deceased, had also fled. Mr. Tang then instructed that the autopsy showed that the deceased Lü Zhenming was male and died from gunshot wounds.

At the end of November last year, when it approached the sea off Wusongkou, the helmsman neglected to steer, and the boat hit a buoy set up by the customs, the body of the boat exploded, the cabin flooded, and the boat and cargo immediately sank to the bottom of the sea. Sixteen crew members on the entire boat were fortunate to escape. Mr. Liu, a cargo owner, suffered heavy losses. At that time, due to the deep and wide water at the sinking location, it was impossible to salvage. Therefore, the total loss of the boat and cargo was about more than ten thousand yuan. According to customs officials, the sunken boat was once discovered not long ago, but recently, there has been no trace of the boat on the coast, probably due to the erosion of the waves or the impact of high tides and huge waves, and it has drifted elsewhere.</p>

<p>The peasant Zhang Yongchang, who lives in Pengpu Township, was suddenly robbed by four armed bandits at around 5:30 AM yesterday morning. At that time, Zhang's mother, Tang, sixty-six years old, had just woken up from sleep and saw many unfamiliar men pouring in. Knowing that things were not good, she hurriedly put on her clothes and got out of bed, ran out quickly, and shouted for thieves. When the bandits saw that things were difficult to accomplish, they turned back and exited, and saw a bicycle in the corner of the house, so they grabbed it and rushed out of the outer room. But at this time, Tang was still shouting wildly. In desperation, the bandits fired a shot at her, hitting her left shoulder, and she fell to the ground on the spot. The bandits were able to escape leisurely. Security team members nearby heard the gunshots and rushed to the scene, but it was too late to pursue them. They sent Tang to the hospital for treatment and cooperated with the police station to search for the culprits everywhere.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Many People Commit Suicide in Hotel Rooms - Oriental Hotel <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The Oriental Hotel at the intersection of Guangdong Road and Xizang Road had a male guest check in the night before last, booking room number 343. He claimed to be Zhang Qishan, thirty years old, from Anhui. But at around 7:00 PM yesterday, the tea servant on the floor suddenly heard groaning sounds in the room, as if something had happened. He hurriedly stepped forward and knocked on the door, but there was no response for a long time. He then tried to open the door and saw the guest lying stiffly in bed, with a bluish-purple face and white foam gushing from his mouth. There were three empty opium boxes beside the pillow. Knowing that he had committed suicide by taking poison, he hurriedly reported to the police station and sent him to the hospital for treatment. The situation was very critical. It is said that it was caused by financial difficulties.</p>
<p>Huizhong Hostel</p>
<p>In room number 251 of the New Huizhong Hostel at the intersection of Hankou Road and Hubei Road, a guest from Suzhou, who claimed to be Wu Wenqin, fifty-nine years old, was heard groaning in the room at around 11:00 AM yesterday. The servant on the floor became suspicious and pushed the door open to peek in. He saw the guest with a bluish-purple face, barely breathing, and stiff limbs, lying supine in bed, about to die. The tea servants were shocked and hurriedly reported to the police station and sent him to the hospital for treatment. Because of the deep poisoning and the fact that he was almost sixty years old, his energy was exhausted, so the situation was very critical. As for why he committed suicide, it cannot be speculated because he has not yet regained consciousness.</p>

<p>The Jiangbei fellow associations in this city, Nantong, Jianghuai, Yangzhong, etc., initiated a joint office to help their fellow villagers. Yesterday, they sent a letter to other Jiangbei fellow associations, soliciting them to join the initiation. The original letter said: Respected Sirs, we have found that in recent years, due to floods, droughts, and robberies in various counties in Jiangbei, rural areas have gone bankrupt, and the number of fellow villagers who come to Shanghai to make a living has been increasing day by day. Usually, they are scattered and unorganized, and are often bullied and humiliated by foreigners. There is no way to complain about their grievances. There are also those who are unemployed, destitute, sick, and dead, and there is a lack of assistance and relief. The sight is heartbreaking, and there are rumors from time to time. Although each county has a fellow association in Shanghai, due to the large number of people and affairs, it is not possible to take care of everyone. Our association, etc., has realized this, so we initiated the establishment of a joint office of fellow associations in Shanghai from various counties in Jiangbei to unite and help each other to promote the strength of unity, so as to help each other in the same boat and benefit our fellow villagers. We have always admired your association for its years of establishment and its great concern for seeking the welfare of fellow villagers living here. We hope that you will sympathize with the establishment of this joint office, and we dare to invite your association to join the initiation, so that we can convene a joint meeting on a regular basis to discuss how to proceed. We hope that you will investigate and reply.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Baiye's Divorce Mediation Fails - Both Sides Argue Over Expenses - Relatives and Friends Make Every Effort to Mediate <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Ye Ruyuan, the elder brother of Ye Ruyu, a well-known Shanghai Sutan female opera singer, is over thirty years old. In the 16th year of the Republic of China, he married Bai Shouhe (33 years old this year), a woman from Tongxiang, Zhejiang, as his wife. The following year, they had a daughter who is nine years old this year. The couple's relationship was very close after marriage, and they lived in Ye Ruyu's home at No. 137, Jinxiang Lane, Glock Road, in the French Concession of this port. Bai also followed her younger sister-in-law Ruyu to learn Tanhuang. Soon, she became skilled and went out to perform at temples and on stage. Recently, the love between the couple suddenly broke down. Ye Bai Shouhe could no longer live with her husband and live to old age, so she left home and lived separately. She then appointed Zhao Zu as her lawyer to file a petition with the Civil Court of the Second Special Court, requesting mediation to divorce Ye Ruyuan. According to the petition, the court summoned both parties to mediate in the seventh courtroom yesterday morning, with Guo Huaipu as the judge. Both parties arrived with their lawyers. First, the petitioner Ye Bai Shouhe stated the reasons for mediation. The respondent Ye Ruyuan said that his wife had learned Tanhuang and could go on stage, but she had an affair and secretly transported household items out one after another. I did not abuse or beat her. He opposed the divorce, etc. After verifying the words in court, the court declared that the mediation had failed because the opinions of both parties were opposite. The petitioner was ordered to file a formal lawsuit according to law, and then they adjourned. It is heard that relatives and friends of both parties are mediating after the court's mediation failed. The petitioner is only willing to pay the respondent 100 yuan for damages, while the respondent's side means that they will not allow the divorce unless they return 500 yuan. Relatives and friends are now making every effort to mediate. It is still difficult to predict whether this matter can be settled outside the court and avoid litigation.</p>

<p>Ren Lin, an old woman residing at No. 41, Dongqinglian Street in the city, was sixty years old and a native of Ningbo. While working as a helper in Jin Yuli, Chujiaqiao, in the French Concession, she met a Fenghua woman (whose name is unknown), who is now over forty years old and lives in Pudong at A Jie's place. Because she was poor and had no food, she came to Ren Lin's place in the city a few days ago, asking her to ask for rice tickets to make a living. She was kept for one night. But yesterday morning, the woman was pouring the chamber pot for her and was about to release the tap water when she suddenly fell to the ground for some reason. When she heard the alarm and went out to look, she was barely breathing. Fearing that she would be implicated, she invited a coal store old driver to help drag the Fenghua woman to the nearby Dunshunli mouth. But she saw that the wind had stopped and she died. Someone reported to the Old North Gate Police Station, and police chief Ma Yumin was immediately dispatched to investigate. According to neighbors, it was only known that the nameless female corpse was moved out by Ren Lin, so Ren Lin was taken to the station. Meanwhile, the landlord Jiang Pingyang was ordered to report to the court for inspection. It is heard that the result of the inspection was that she died of illness.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Wu Shouquan Was Defrauded in Xiamen While Selling Xiangzai Lottery Tickets on Consignment - The Subject Is Unclear and Cannot Be Verified <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Wu Shouquan, a native of Siming, Fujian, thirty-five years old this year, used to open Dachuan Silver Company at the intersection of Zhongshan Road and Shuixian Road in Xiamen, operating banking business, and also selling the current lottery tickets. In October of last year, he received a letter from Sun Houcheng, the owner of Heji Shenzhuang, No. 33 Chengyu Lane, Lafayette Road, French Concession, Shanghai, saying that Heji Shenzhuang was selling Hunan Xiangzai relief lottery tickets on consignment, soliciting Wu to promote the Xiangzai lottery ticket business in Xiamen. Wu immediately replied and agreed to sell on consignment. Sun then sent Wu 500 eighth-term Xiangzai relief lottery tickets on November 25, and continued to send 1,000 ninth-term Xiangzai relief lottery tickets on December 25. After receiving these lottery tickets, Wu sold them in Xiamen, and remitted the ticket price of 440 yuan in cash. But when Wu was selling the second batch of lottery tickets, he found that these lottery tickets were forged, so he informed Heji Shenzhuang and negotiated with Sun. Sun replied that these lottery tickets were purchased from Liji Company in Hankou, etc. Wu then reported this to the Xiamen Chamber of Commerce and sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Government for investigation, but to no avail. He also telegraphed Hankou to trace Liji Company, and received a reply denying that it had sold Xiangzai lottery tickets. People in Xiamen who bought lottery tickets negotiated with Wu one after another, causing Wu to be implicated and suffer heavy losses. When he came to Shanghai in person to seek out Sun for investigation, he was also troubled by not seeing Sun in person, and there was no Heji Shenzhuang at No. 33 Chengyu Lane. Wu then hired Tang Youwei as a lawyer to file a self-lawsuit with the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court based on the location of Heji Shenzhuang's letters received in the past, accusing Sun Houcheng of forging lottery tickets and defrauding property, requesting the court to investigate and punish him according to Articles 211 and 339 of the Criminal Law, and attaching a civil lawsuit, requesting to recover the defrauded ticket price of 440 yuan, etc. According to the petition, the court summoned the plaintiff in the Criminal Court yesterday by Criminal Court President Wang Gangxu. Because he had returned to Xiamen, the agent lawyer came to court to state the facts of the case and presented the correspondence. The defendant no longer lived at the original address and could not be served with a summons, so he did not appear in court. The plaintiff's lawyer also stated that the defendant had fled since this incident, and requested that he be allowed to be wanted or that an arrest warrant be issued to bring him to court for investigation. After reviewing the documents submitted to the court, the court decided that since the defendant's whereabouts were unknown, it was impossible to detain him, and the subject of the crime was unclear, so it was ordered to postpone the case and ordered the plaintiff to visit and investigate the defendant's whereabouts and then file a petition to the court for review.</p>
<h3 id="e130">The Various District Joint Associations Will Again Petition the Municipal Government Regarding Instructions to Reduce Rent <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal various district rent reduction joint associations are sparing no effort in promoting rent reduction. Starting from the 25th year of the Republic [1936], the various district associations have taken turns hosting and funding the recurring expenses. The association's plans have already been reported in the newspapers. It is learned that the association has scheduled a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees to be held at its headquarters at 13 Chezhan Road at 2:00 PM on the 12th of this month to discuss important proposals. It plans to again petition the municipal government and upper-level authorities for instructions to implement rent reduction measures, and notify tenants in various streets and lanes that have not yet organized branches to quickly unite, organize branches, and join the nearest district associations to strengthen their power.</p>
<p>Another report states that Ma Chijun, Xu Dingchen, Ding Bingkun, and other tenants of the Zhongbei Gongyi Lane in Zhabei, due to the impact of the current situation, could not bear the pain of high rents. Therefore, last year, they submitted a petition to the Shanghai North District Rent Reduction Association to register for rent reduction efforts. After negotiations with the landlord, fortunately, the landlord, Mr. Shen Lianfang, deeply understood the righteousness and agreed to reduce the rent based on the reduction amount in the South Gongyi Lane, collecting 87.5% of the original rent, starting from November of last year. It is now heard that the branch has submitted a report to the North District Association, which has approved the completion of registration in accordance with the registration guidelines. All expenses will be borne equally by the members, and a branch seal issued by the district will be affixed to the receipts as proof to comply with the procedures.</p>

<p>According to Dagong News Agency, Dakangyong, a broker at the Gold Exchange, previously submitted a request to the Ministry to urge the issuance of a license. Furthermore, Jinfuquan telegraphed the Ministry to strictly investigate the exchange's embezzlement of license fees. According to a statement issued by the person in charge of the exchange, the Dakangyong Gold Shop, broker license number 160, had already been transferred to another party after it closed down. The Dakangyong broker was Wang Xiaohe, not Jinfuquan. The broker license of Wang Xiaohe was received on February 26th of last year. The broker had not yet come to collect it, and a notice of closure was reported on April 1st. The license has been submitted to the Ministry of Industry in accordance with the law. The Ministry of Industry has been notified and the matter has been thoroughly investigated and reported. The exchange stated that brokers' applications for licenses are submitted to the Ministry for issuance. In addition to brokers collecting them in accordance with procedures, the remaining licenses are kept by the exchange for collection. Jinfu's claim that a certain director colluded to embezzle funds is shocking.</p>

<p>The Huahua Silk and Satin Company, located at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Yunnan Road, in order to reciprocate the kindness of customers since its opening last year, and at the beginning of this 25th year [1936], strives for improvement in order to provide customers with more satisfactory service. Starting from the previous day, it is holding a 20% off sale for seven days. Because the company has always adopted a policy of small profits and high sales, it has been praised by all parties. Adding this major sacrifice of 20% off and giving cash gifts is still an innovation in the silk industry. Therefore, new and old customers have been extremely crowded in recent days, similar to the scene when the company first opened. Its lively situation is similar to that of the newly opened Daxin Department Store nearby.</p>

<p>Pig Vendor Entrusts 50 Yuan, Goes Missing</p>
<p>Gu Demao, a 40-year-old man from Yangzhou, recently came to Shanghai from his hometown to sell pigs. Through the introduction of Chen Tingfang from Rugao, he sold the pigs to Changshun Pig Company, receiving 56 yuan, 3 jiao and 4 fen in legal tender. After receiving the money, Gu hid some of the money on his person and planned to visit Shanghai for a few days. He entrusted the remaining 50 yuan to Liu Dahu, a fellow villager, to take back to his home in Yangzhou. Unexpectedly, Liu had ulterior motives and embezzled the entrusted money. It was not until Gu returned home that he learned that the money had not been delivered. He rushed back to Shanghai and found Liu Dahu yesterday, taking him to the police station for investigation.</p>

<p>Xuzhou, 11th - When the Copper Commissioner's Office held a children's speech contest at the beginning of the year, Hu Xing Su, a female student from the attached elementary school of Xuzhou Normal School, proposed that children in Jiangsu Province save candy money to cast a treasure sword to present to Chairman Chiang, as a way to ask Chiang to command the people to resist insults and kill the enemy.

<p>— Lei Zhen</p>
<p>Holding of the Sixth National Games</p>
<p>The Sixth National Games was held at the Shanghai Municipal Central Stadium from October 10th to October 20th last year, lasting for eleven days. A total of 38 units participated, with over 2,700 male and female athletes, an unprecedented scale. The newly built Shanghai Municipal Central Stadium, with its magnificent architecture and complete facilities, is unmatched in the Far East and greatly enhanced the event. Since the opening ceremony, the total expenditure was 150,000 yuan, and many national records were broken in the men's and women's mountain cross-country races. This is sufficient to prove that China's sports have made considerable progress.</p>
<p>Organization of Educational Broadcasting</p>
<p>Recognizing the importance of radio broadcasting for education, the Ministry of Education organized educational broadcasts starting on October 10th last year. It first trained radio operators within the ministry and then ordered secondary schools and public education centers in various provinces and cities to install receivers in phases so that secondary school students and the general public throughout the country could have the opportunity to receive these broadcasts. All broadcasting lecturers are experts with rich knowledge and experience, and the selected teaching materials are essential knowledge. Currently, this work is proceeding smoothly and will benefit China's educational future if continued.</p>
<p>What I have discussed above is a review of the general situation of central educational administration over the past year. As for the outlook for future administration, in my humble opinion, the following points should be noted:</p>
<p>In terms of higher education, regarding schools above the junior college level, attention should be paid to qualitative improvement rather than focusing on quantitative expansion. As of now, there are 111 colleges and universities nationwide, which is already a considerable number. The central task in the future should be to improve and enrich the existing schools in terms of quality. As for quantitative expansion, it does not seem necessary to expand significantly unless it is necessary for national and ethnic construction. As for qualitative improvement, the most important thing is to focus on academic research and seek the independence of Chinese academics. The Chinese nation should not only seek independence in politics and economics but also in academics, so that it can gain a foothold in the world. In the future, colleges and universities should seek to improve their standards and specialize in academic research to lay the foundation for academic independence. At the same time, the state should actively reward research and inventions to encourage them. One more point is that the government should cultivate specialized talents and academic talents and should also employ them as much as possible. This is the great way to store and use talents.</p>
<p>In terms of general education, every effort should be made to promote compulsory education and vocational education. The importance of compulsory and vocational education is recognized by everyone, and it is also recognized as the most urgent need at present. We have already talked about the promotion of compulsory education above, but it is only the beginning. We should make every effort to promote and expand it in the future to establish the foundation of compulsory education. Vocational education is education for production and is very important at present. We should actively find ways to promote and enrich it.</p>
<p>In terms of social education, the central task in the future is to promote public education and public sports. An effective method should be devised to implement it, so that the public can receive basic training and development in terms of knowledge and physique.</p>
<p>Although there have not been significant achievements in Mongolian and Tibetan education in the past, there are indeed good plans for planning. In the future, we should start with compulsory education in the border areas according to these plans and then gradually seek the establishment of secondary normal schools and vocational education facilities so that we can achieve practical results. (End)</p>

<p>"He didn't, but if he did, I'd stand up for him. He's always been good to me," Ned said, so sincerely that Don forgot his spider and immediately wanted to get up and thank him. But Ned went on:</p>
<p>"I know Don did it. He gave you the money. It's no wonder, if he's been living by cutting locks of hair before, and only you know his background here," Ned said deliberately, trying to provoke him into revealing the truth.</p>
<p>His bad intentions had a partial success, because Ned shouted fiercely:</p>
<p>"If you say it again, I'll go tell Mr. Pei everything. I didn't want to gossip, but if you're going to implicate Don, then I won't hesitate to tell him."</p>
<p>"Then you're not only a thief and a liar, but also an ugly bad guy," Ned began to mock him deliberately, because Ned could endure all insults so well that Ned didn't believe he would dare to complain to the teacher for Don's sake.</p>
<p>I don't know what else he had to say, because before he could finish, an arm grabbed him from behind by the collar, pulled him violently over the wall, and with a splash, threw him into the middle of the stream, where the water splashed and sprayed everywhere.</p>
<p>"If you say it again, I'll press you into the water until you can't even open your eyes!" Don shouted, looking like a statue of a warrior, majestic and high-spirited, his feet straddling either side of the stream, looking down at the fallen boy.</p>
<p>"I was just joking," Ned said.</p>
<p>"You're an ugly bad guy, forcing Ned to be desperate. As long as I see you again next time, I'll soak you in the river. Get up and get out." Don said in a rage, his voice like thunder.</p>

<p>It seems that the Pirate's League Western YMCA basketball championship is almost certain. Ninety percent of the so-called better Chinese teams, Jinan, fought hard last night but could only last for five minutes. The result was that the Pirates defeated Jinan by a score of 51 to 33. Jinan was still able to draw a crowd. The Western YMCA also had a full house last night. The audience was not disappointed because they had expected little hope beforehand. In another Division A match, Xie Xing defeated Youyou 60 to 44. Xie Xing only managed to catch up in the last five minutes.</p>

<p>In the Jinan vs. Pirates match, Jinan took the lead in the first five minutes, and the spectators were delighted. Jinan also had more opportunities than the Pirates, and the Pirates committed numerous fouls. In this situation, Jinan had no hope of winning. However, Jinan lost countless opportunities to score in this superior situation, and the penalty shots were also repeatedly missed. Affected by this setback, the morale of the team was immediately weakened. The Pirates took advantage of the situation to break through and rise sharply. Jinan could not recover.</p>
<p>The First Five Minutes Were Tense. In the first five minutes, Jinan's teamwork was unparalleled. If this kind of cooperation could be trained in shooting, there would be greater hope.

<h3 id="e170">Foreign Exchange Rates Over the Past Year (Continued) <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Ci</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>In 1935, the most important event in China's financial history was the promulgation of the Ministry of Finance's new currency law on November 3. This not only had a significant impact on China's currency system and national economy, but also stabilized foreign exchange, which was unprecedented in the history of foreign exchange changes. China was based on silver, and for more than ten years, foreign exchange was severely affected by the price of silver or the monetary policies of other countries. This not only caused inconvenience to importers and exporters, but also greatly harmed the stability of people's livelihoods and the development of industries. A review of the fluctuations in foreign exchange rates in recent years will illustrate the general situation.</p>
<p>Shanghai Telegraphic Transfer Exchange Rate Table for British Pounds, US Dollars, and Japanese Yen (Note 3)</p>
<p>In the autumn and winter of 1931, Britain and Japan successively abandoned the gold standard, and foreign exchange rates saw a slight increase (but not very significant). In 1933, the United States also broke away from the gold standard. In these years, various countries devalued their currencies, all by about 40% to 60% below the old prices. China's foreign exchange rates should have risen accordingly, but in reality, the increase was minimal. It was not until 1934 that the rise occurred in Shanghai. In May 1935, the British pound reached 20.125 pence, the highest price in five years, but it still fluctuated from time to time. It was not until November 3 that the government announced the new currency regulations, adopting the pegging method, stabilizing the British pound at 14.5 pence, the US dollar at 29.75 yuan, and the Japanese yen at 103 yuan, and it has not been changed to this day. However, there are two points that deserve our special attention:</p>
<p>In the first half of this year, China was affected by the depreciation of foreign exchange rates and the increase in the price of silver, and the foreign exchange rates began to rise sharply. The high price in May had offset the extent to which China's foreign exchange rates had fallen due to the decline in the price of silver, and restored the normal state of 1929—that is, 20.524 pence. The promulgation of the Ministry of Finance's new currency law on November 3 opened the era of China's foreign exchange management, and foreign exchange rates will have a stable trend in the future.</p>
<p>The determination of China's foreign exchange rates is based on the London large-bar price, that is, the fixed number of taels of pure silver contained in each unit of China's currency is multiplied by the London large-bar silver price on that day, which will be the exchange rate for the British pound on that day (the exchange rates for other countries are calculated based on the British pound, using cross rates). However, since the United States raised the price of silver, China's foreign exchange rates have not in fact risen in equal amounts with the increase in the price of silver, so phenomena such as the outflow of silver have occurred. The following compares the situation of the London silver price and China's foreign exchange rates this year (Note 4): (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e171">Securities Traded On Terms Public Bonds <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>The difference is too great, and it is impossible to swap. Moreover, considering the environment and situation, there are rumors that the bonds themselves have changed. The situation in Shanxi and Suiyuan is becoming increasingly serious, and the financial community is still skeptical. Therefore, many are willing to hand over the spot goods and wait and see temporarily. Therefore, the trend and future prospects are such that if large investors do not swap arbitrage, the market price will be difficult to improve. Yesterday's process: at the opening in the morning, only the current month's demobilization bonds rose by 4.5 jiao, and thereafter consistently fell by 0.05 to 0.4 jiao. No. 48 bonds were still being sold continuously, and No. 4 bonds were also being disposed of. In the second session, due to more swap transactions, the market prices of one or two types slightly firmed, but the rest continued to fall by 0.1 to 0.5 yuan. Transactions were not vigorous, and the market price repeatedly weakened, all caused by rumors that the bonds themselves would be reformed. At the opening in the afternoon, a portion of retail investors made up for their positions, because it was Saturday and they temporarily wanted to close out. The closing price still tended to be weak, with forward demobilization bonds falling by 0.4 jiao, and the rest also tending to be weak by about 0.1 to 0.3 jiao. The situation was weak, and it was difficult to expect improvement. The market price resulted in a fall of 0.1 to 0.5 yuan. The total turnover was 14,370,000 yuan. The results of the rise and fall are compared in the following table (unit: yuan, turnover unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>The Sin Fung Foreign Firm reported that the New York stock market rose across the board yesterday (the 10th). The government is rushing to draft measures to replace the agricultural adjustment law. The agricultural machinery stocks, which had been sluggish for days, rebounded. Oil stocks also rose due to the increase in crude oil prices in Texas. Auto stocks rose as production increased sharply. The Standard Statistics Company predicts that industrial production in January will still be good, but slightly lower than in December. The predicted index is 79.5, compared to the production index of 72.3 in January last year. The talk of inflation is rampant. Sound elements believe that this movement will not expand in the short term, but say that the government's budget is unbalanced and there must be a relief plan in the end. Stocks on the small exchange rose, and the bond market stabilized. Total turnover for the day was 3.27 million shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e173">Yarn and Cotton: US Cotton No. 3 Rose Again, Yarn and Cotton Rebounded Higher, Short Sellers Profited and Covered Positions <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>After the sharp drop in the yarn market the previous day, it rebounded today. US cotton No. 3 yarn turned higher. Retail investors rushed to cover their short positions, but the general intention of the industry was to sell, because its base had risen too high. However, the large amount of capital in the financial community was still unwilling to give up, which shows that the competition between the bulls and bears was fierce.</p>
<p>Yarn Rises One Yuan and Three</p>
<p>At the opening of the morning market for standard yarn, various months saw a slight recovery. The previous day's sharp drop was too violent, causing those who made a profit to cover their short positions. Today, US cotton No. 3 yarn turned higher across the board. People's hearts turned from danger to safety. Sellers were not as eager as the previous day, and the situation turned tense. The market gradually rebounded higher. As a result, various months rose by 0.9 to 1.24 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day. At the opening of the afternoon market, it was heard that cotton No. 3 rose by 2-3 yuan. Sales of spot yarn were smoother than before, and the situation on the table could still be maintained. Tung Cheng Company came to buy again, and the market price relied on it for support. As a result, various months rose by 1.2-1.3 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Da Feng sold 800 bales, Da Kee 900 bales, Kam Cheung 800 bales, Hap Hing 450 bales, Yan Fung 550 bales, Yick Cheung 350 bales, Kang Fung 300 bales, Cheung Fung 350 bales, Tung Wo 550 bales.

<p>After the sharp drop in the cotton market the previous day, US cotton futures rebounded by over 0.1 yuan today. People's hearts were greatly calmed. The atmosphere of shock and emptiness temporarily dissipated. However, American merchant Macy &amp; Co. continued to sell. How the future will be depends on the expansion and contraction of foreign cotton.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Rebounded Three or Four Jiao</p>
<p>At the opening of the morning market for domestic cotton, various months turned better, because the previous day's decline was too drastic, and most people expected US cotton to continue to decline. Unexpectedly, the foreign telegram rebounded by over 0.1 yuan for futures, and the market was greatly encouraged. It was found that the October price for US cotton was 10.02, and the December price was 10.01, up 19-25 points. Short sellers profited and covered their positions, causing the market to rise slowly. However, the bulls of American merchant Macy &amp; Co. continued to close out 10,000 dan, but the large amount of capital of Japanese merchants remained unmoved. The financial community spit out slightly, and the situation on the table was able to pass by peacefully. As a result, various months rose by 0.2-0.3-0.4 jiao compared to the closing price of the previous day. At the opening of the afternoon market, it was heard that cotton No. 3 closed firm. The selling sentiment in the market was not strong, and a certain company came to buy again, so the market was tighter. As a result, distant months rose by 0.05-0.1 yuan compared to the morning closing price, and near months were stagnant. It was found that Cheung Fung sold 1,700 dan, Kang Fung 3,300 dan, Mei Kee 7,300 dan, Yick Cheung 1,400 dan, Shun Cheng 4,800 dan, Foo Yuen 900 dan.

<p>Yesterday, when the US cotton market opened, the news from Liverpool was good, and the Liverpool gang bought, and short positions were covered. However, the Far East and cotton farmers sold slightly. Various months rose by 1-8 points. The delivery notice for January is about to expire, and people's hearts are focused on Washington. According to Davis, the director of the Agricultural Adjustment Committee, the plan proposed by agricultural leaders may be implemented for the new cotton of 1936. Later, rumors spread that the House of Representatives would pass the European war pension bill. Short positions were actively covered, and the market price rose sharply. Hester estimated that the factory consumption this week was 364,000 bales, and Liverpool's inventory was 398,000 bales. The final closing was slightly weak.

<h3 id="e175">Tung Cotton Suddenly Rises, Purchasing Hankou Cotton <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>(Hankou Correspondence) The local cotton market is sluggish, and people's hearts are weak, because the news from all sides is not good, so exporters are still hesitant. However, the Hunan yarn factories are particularly keen on purchasing, and the suction power is progressing, with both coarse and fine varieties being purchased. In addition, Japanese merchant Tung Cotton is buying on the market, and the price of goods can still be held tight. Today, 750 wooden frames, 98 bales, 250 medium bales, and 1,200 small bales were traded, totaling 2,298 bales. The opening prices of cotton from various producing areas are listed below:</p>
<h3 id="e176">Grains: Flour Asking Prices Rise <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market showed a gradual increase again. At the opening in the morning, because the quotation for foreign wheat returned to good by about 0.1-0.2 jiao, people's hearts in the market were high because the raw materials were becoming scarce day by day and the foreign wheat was always difficult to determine. Most people were bullish on the future situation, so although buyers were not very smooth, the asking prices entered a better state, 0.01 jiao better than the closing price of the previous day. By the time the afternoon market opened, transactions were quite active, with buyers entering and exiting each other. The market atmosphere was still stable and firm in the midst of calm, because the factories threw out very little and began to withdraw this month, so the market atmosphere was old. Better than the morning by 0.05 jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Wheat Futures Shift with the Flour Market <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures trading was extremely quiet. Only one price was opened for March, and the rest were suspended. By the time the afternoon market opened, trading was still quiet, but people's hearts also showed a boost as the flour market rose. People's hearts were easy to boost because foreign wheat was difficult to determine. The rise and fall in the future still depends on the flour market. February rose by 0.06 jiao, and June rose by 0.01 jiao. Spot wheat delivery has also turned quiet. All-day sporadic transactions, prices are few honors and disgraces.</p>
<h3 id="e178">River Rice Sales Weak and Soft <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than 50 sources from various gangs (totaling over 10,000 piculs of goods). Sales in this street were still moving but not smooth. Although the price of thick early japonica rice did not have much movement, the market showed a clear fixed and dark tired state. Thin indica rice was purchased for 3,000+ bags, and the price was modified due to the quantity of goods, with high material being close to 0.1 yuan, medium-grade 0.05 yuan. Doyang sharp shadow change yuan had no increase or decrease.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were 52-53 sources from various gangs under the river. White japonica rice sales were normal in stores, and hoarders stopped purchasing. High-quality materials were in a fixed trend, while medium and inferior grades were soft. Early indica rice followed closely for nearly 0.1 yuan, while thin indica rice was slightly soft. Yangpu sharp arrived at little sales, and the price was flat and tired. Baiyuan arrived at vigorous sales and was stagnant. High-quality goods were tired for 0.06 jiao outside, medium and inferior grade prices were small 0.1 yuan. Yinyuan was tired, and the prices of other goods were tired.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Guest Indica Rice Arrived in Large Quantities and Sold Finely <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, guest indica rice continued to arrive at the port, especially from the Yangtze River all the way continuously, with 6,000-7,000 bags arriving at the port every day. The various provinces of Zhejiang also arrived with a bumper harvest, and the hoarders stopped purchasing again. Sales in the north have been stagnant for a long time, only relying on this street, and the market is ultimately difficult to improve section by section. Yesterday arrived in large quantities and sold finely, and the situation turned weak again. Although the Xiamen gang inquired, the number of sales was extremely small, and had nothing to do with the rise and fall of the market. Therefore, most people's hearts are looking small, but the hoarders still plan to keep small and then purchase. This street has a daily embellishment, so the market price lacks recovery. Yesterday, 964 bags of Jiangxi rice, 500 bags of Hankou rough rice, and 1,617 bags of rice from various provinces of Zhejiang were opened, as well as 100 bags of foreign yuan rice, all of which were purchased by this street, and the price was similar to the previous market.</p>

<p>Foreign estate sesame seeds have weak sales and a dull market state. The sellers' minds are firm, and the market price has no significant price differences. Although 200 tons were once opened at 11.75 yuan, the market yesterday has returned to the original plate, which is 11.8 yuan, and 200 tons were traded, still ordering delivery in February. The final closing period is near, and the trend may be fixed. Low-grade and medium-grade yellow soybeans have few enquirers, and the market is now tired and soft. High-grade goods are scarce and the market is stable. The upper and middle passes are relatively active. Yesterday, two cars of Bengbu soybeans, 200 bags of Zhengcheng soybeans, 900 bags of Shahuangshe soybeans, and 200 bags of Zha soybeans were opened.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market still had no improvement due to the relatively soft Customs Gold. The guild set the plate for No. 24 coarse sand white spot goods at 22.5 yuan, and transit goods at 7.25 yuan, both lacking ups and downs.

<p>The price of white lotus roots has been rising frequently due to the increasingly thin market base recently, showing new peaks. The highest price in Shanghai was sold to 62 yuan, and then rose by 6 yuan again. However, the land price is even tighter. According to a dispatch from Lanxi yesterday, it even requires 65-66 yuan, but has not yet been willing to sell immediately, and it is predicted that the spring plate will reach 70 yuan. Most of the cargo owners are extremely hoarding.</p>

<h3 id="e185">What Kind of Person Will I Be in the Future? <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— (First Prize in the Newspaper Essay Contest) Qiu Zhengxi, Chengbei Elementary School, Yiqu District, Jiangdu County, Jiangsu</p>
<p>Some people say that the reason why Chinese people are oppressed by foreigners is entirely due to the underdevelopment of science. This is very true.</p>
<p>Nowadays, all kinds of undertakings in the world are related to science. Because foreign countries have developed science and prospered industry, they are rich and powerful, so they can oppress our weak and small nations with backward science. If we want to resist the powerful and restore our free and equal status, we can only defeat them by developing science. Therefore, I am willing to be a scientist in the future, to fulfill my responsibility as a national.</p>
<p>But I am not willing to be a scientist who only knows how to invent artillery and poison gas to kill human beings. I am willing to be a scientist who is beneficial to the people, society, the country, and the world.</p>
<p>Like Pasteur in France, I will study and improve the agriculture and sericulture of my country, so that the harvest is abundant, the quality is excellent, and it is easy to sell to foreign countries.</p>
<p>Like Edison in the United States, I will invent many machines that use electricity as the driving force of industry, so that the products are cheap and good, and a lot of money can be made. Pasteur made France rich and powerful, Edison made the United States rich and powerful, and I also want to make China rich and powerful. But it is useless to just talk about it. I am now an elementary school student. I must work hard to learn, without interruption for a day. I must do it according to the following two methods:</p>
<p>(1) I must strive to study with my eyes anytime and anywhere, not completely relying on books. All phenomena in nature, such as the changes of cold and heat, the growth of all things, etc., must be recorded day by day as research materials.</p>
<p>(2) I must start with small things and gradually study big problems. For example, Newton saw an apple fall and knew about gravity, and Watt saw a lid overturn and invented the steam engine. These are the research spirits that I should emulate.</p>
<p>If all the elementary school students in the country can have the same ambition as me, and my ambition is achieved in the future, China will also become rich and powerful. At that time, what is there to fear of the oppression of imperialism?</p>
<p>This magazine received a letter from Mr. Qiu's parents a few days ago, saying: "The prize money of fifty yuan has been decided to be used to purchase children's books for the school library, as a permanent memorial for our library...:" We think the method is excellent, and after admiring it, we specially publish it as above.

<h3 id="e186">Tap Water <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>On Sunday, Min'er, in addition to reviewing his homework, had nothing to do, and asked his brother Cong'er to go to the bustling city to play with him. This was not the first request. So Cong'er agreed to him, so the two brothers walked to the city.</p>
<p>Before long, they had arrived at their destination. Min'er felt it was really fun. The shop windows on all sides were displaying colorful and bizarre things, making Min'er unable to see them in detail, and he kept asking his brother: What is this thing? What is that thing called? Cong'er was laughing at his brother's ignorance, but it was no wonder him, he had never seen these things before.</p>
<p>Gradually, they arrived at the entrance of a restaurant. Min'er saw a person turning on the tap, and clean water flowed out very quickly. Min'er was stunned, and quickly asked his brother:</p>
<p>"Brother, look, how can there be water coming out of that tap?"</p>
<p>"That water comes from the waterworks. There are many large water-pumping machines in the factory that can pump water from the river into very high water storage tanks. Some people call it a water tower. Then the water is distributed to everyone's homes through other iron pipes, but before it is sent to everyone's homes, there are many steps of work, such as disinfection and chemical testing, to know whether the water is clean, otherwise, it is easy to spread diseases."</p>
<p>"How does water come down from the water tower?"</p>
<p>"This is the use of the siphon effect. A siphon is a curved tube with unequal arms that can transfer water from a high place to a low place without having to pour the container. You think the water tower is so big, how can you pour the water tower? You can only use the siphon effect. In short, how does water come down from the water tower? It depends on the pressure of the air."</p>
<p>"I don't believe it!" Min'er said suspiciously.</p>
<p>"Okay, let's go home and try it for you." So the two quickly ran home.</p>
<p>Cong'er took a rubber tube and two bowls. He put one bowl in a high place and the other bowl in a low place, and then put the two ends of the tube into the bowls. The bowl in the high place had been filled with water, so he sucked the low end of the tube, and the water came down continuously. He said, "This is a siphon, as for the pen cap sucking water, the rubber tube in the fountain pen, this is also a siphon, but it is a metamorphosis."</p>

<p>— Dingming</p>
<p>I. Preface</p>
<p>Japan, setting aside other considerations for the sake of "amicable relations," is indeed a very progressive country in academic circles. For example, there are cartoons for children, women, literature, politics, and so on. Recently, in their "New Year's Supplement to the Boys' Club" cartoon school (name omitted), I saw Quan Jing Cilang's depictions of bizarre manga methods. Not daring to keep them to myself, I will introduce the original drawings and texts, either sketched or summarized, to children who love cartoons!</p>
<p>II. Cartooning Sketches</p>
<p>III. Talking about and Translating Cartoons</p>
<p>The feature of this page of cartoon books is its large depictions, which make it very interesting. A brief description follows:</p>
<p>Look at those large depictions, whether viewed vertically or horizontally, they are either long, short, big, small, round, or oval. Viewed lengthwise, they are almost the same, aren't they? Taking it a step further, the most unique aspects are entirely different. At the same time, the interest deepens layer by layer. Looking at the whole page, the meaning of this cartoon is different from the meaning of that cartoon.</p>
<p>Clearly it is a chestnut, but as it changes, it turns into a child. Clearly it's like a round moon, but as it changes, a fox emerges as if it wants to climb out. It's something for offering to the gods (actually it looks like a gourd, but part by part it gradually turns into a lion from the face). The following are all this kind of evolving method.</p>
<p>Dear children, please think about it!</p>
<h3 id="e189">A Scientist's Fortune Telling <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Kangjian Zhaifu</p>
<p>Will the world really end?</p>
<p>If the Earth is destroyed, or the Sun disappears, then everything is over.</p>
<p>Anyone who has seen waterfalls should know that when a waterfall flows down from a high place, a small portion of the water is constantly evaporated into the air by the sunlight, and not all of it falls into the stream. According to modern scientists, the Sun constantly emits heat in the sky, and its heat is constantly diminishing, just like a waterfall evaporates some of its water. The largest waterfall in America is Niagara Falls. Every minute, the Sun loses 250 million tons of its weight; this weight is equal to 150 times that of Niagara Falls.</p>
<p>A hundred years ago, scientists believed that the materials in the world were neither created nor destroyed, and that they would always remain the same, without any increase or decrease. Now, Einstein has shattered this old theory and corrected the erroneous views in physics.</p>
<p>In this way, the Sun is constantly emitting energy and is becoming smaller day by day. How many years can it still exist? It is said that because it is naturally abundant and its size is extremely large, pulling a hair from a fat man's body is not a big deal. It can exist for at least one hundred million years.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Earth we live on, although it is smaller and colder than the Sun, it still emits an ounce of heat every minute (less than two taels in weight). In a 24-hour day and night, the Earth loses 81 catties in weight. But the Earth is, after all, a behemoth, and these losses are not worth mentioning.</p>
<p>The end of the world is still far away, so how can we not strive for the self-reliance and survival of our nation!</p>
<h3 id="e190">Weekday Calculation Method <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Huiming</p>
<p>Time flies like electricity; in an instant, twenty-four years have passed like a dream; the twenty-fifth year has already arrived.</p>
<p>Children! Everyone knows that the weekdays of each year are very complicated. Is it not a difficult task to immediately ask what weekday a certain day in a certain month falls on? Even if you look up the calendar, it takes a considerable amount of time. Now I am here to introduce a - 25th year - weekday calculation method for you. If you learn this method, it will be convenient and accurate to calculate weekdays, and it is also very interesting. Children! Let's follow the method below and play around! Months: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12</p>
<p>Numbers: 2, 5, 6, 2, 4, 7, 2, 5, 1, 3, 6, 1</p>
<p>This method is very simple. You only need to memorize the numbers for each month on the table to implement it.</p>
<p>Method: Add the number for the month you want to find out to the day of that month, then divide by seven. The remainder is the weekday you are looking for. If it divides evenly, then it is Sunday. For example, what weekday is September 16th? You can add the number for September on the table to 16, which is 17, then divide 17 by 7. The remainder is 3, so that day is Wednesday.</p>
<p>There are two more things to pay attention to: First, the numbers in this calculation table are only applicable to the 25th year. If it is past the 25th year, you will need to determine the numbers again. Second, for any numbers within the table that, when added to the day, result in a number within seven, you don't need to divide by seven. That number is the weekday for that day.</p>

<p>— Elementary School Student Bana</p>
<p>Children, I think you all know the harm of picking your ears. But there is another kind of harm that most children don't know. I'm going to tell you about it now.</p>
<p>One day, I was sitting at home doing nothing. Suddenly, I saw a box of toothpicks on the table. I thought about picking my ears, so I grabbed one and did it. Suddenly, I wasn't careful and punctured the eardrum inside my ear. I felt a little pain, and then it stopped. I also heard people say: it will flare up during the seasonal changes. Later, on the seventh night, my ear hurt a lot, and the membrane inside was vibrating. After a day or two, I felt a little better.</p>
<p>I advise all children, never pick your ears.</p>

<p>— Xinqing</p>
<p>Pádhishí endured this long and deep pain for two whole years. He always walked to the city of Robben along that rugged road as usual. One day it was in midsummer, and the weather was very hot. The cart he was pulling was piled high with pottery and metal goods. His master idled by his side, constantly whipping his trembling waist.</p>
<p>The villain himself always bought beer to drink in the roadside hotels, but he did not allow Pádhishí to stop and drink a mouthful of river water. Poor thing, he had been running on the fiery road under the scorching sun for twenty-four hours without eating anything, and even more heartbreakingly, he had not drunk a drop of water in twelve hours. Dust and sand sealed his eyes, the whip lashed his body, and he had to pull the heavy cart, making him miserable. Once he foamed at the mouth and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>He fell in the snow-white road full of dust and sand, and the scorching sun still oppressed him cruelly. He lay motionless there, clearly looking like he was about to die. His master cursed and kicked him, and even took a short stick made of stalk wood and beat him randomly. This was the only food and the only reward given to him.</p>
<p>But Pádhishí could no longer be forced to get up by scolding and kicking. He still stretched his limbs and lay stiff in the center of the road like a dead man. The snow-white dust and sand buried half of his body.</p>
<p>After a while, the villain saw that he was still not moving and thought he was dead for sure. So he scolded him harshly a few times, untied all the straps on his body, kicked him hard into the pile of grass on the side of the road, and he was still cursing endlessly. He pulled the cart himself and walked slowly up the hill, leaving the poor dog lying in the grass, to be bitten by ants and pecked by crows.</p>
<p>This day was the last day of the grand festival in the Robben area, so the villain was eager to rush to the market there, so he could choose a good location to display his goods.</p>
<p>This time, he was really angry, because Pádhishí was originally a strong and very patient dog. Pulling a cart was his special job, but now he had to pull this cart and rush all the way to Robben. In his anger, he no longer wanted to carefully 〇一〇 Pádhishí. He thought he was bound to die and had no use. Later, he could just steal a big dog to replace Pádhishí's job, and he himself would not suffer much loss. He no longer cared about Pádhishí's hard work over the past two years.</p>
<p>The villain had gone far away. And Pádhishí was still lying in the pile of grass on the side of the road.</p>
<p>This day was a very busy day on the road. Thousands of people, some walking, some riding donkeys, and some driving freight cars, happily and hurriedly set off for Robben. Some glanced at him, some did not pay attention, and all passed by. But what did the life and death of a dog have to do with them?</p>
<p>Before long, among the many pedestrians, came a little old man, hunchbacked, limping, and very weak. The clothes on his body were very tattered, showing his poverty everywhere. He just hobbled along slowly in the dust and sand.</p>

<h3 id="e195">Talking about Drugs for Treating Gonorrhea <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Doctor Feng Shanliang</p>
<p>There are many ways to treat gonorrhea, such as electrotherapy, injection, washing, internal medication, etc. Except for electrotherapy, injection, washing, and internal medication can all be called drug treatment. As for injection, the latecomers advocated all pigments and mixed vaccines. The best of the pigments are "Andaixueqing" and "Tuolvpaifulawen." The most peaceful, stable, and effective mixed vaccine for immunization is the French-made "Naiyademai Gong." The washing used to be mostly bactericidal solutions of protein silver preparations. The ones used now are also based on the principle of immunotherapy for gonorrhea, and the local injection of gonorrhea serum achieves effective results. Among the ready-made preparations, the most suitable is "Lin Du Shu Yao Er." Look at the newspaper advertisements for the most types of products. It is already a beautiful sight. Generally speaking, those containing strong astringent ingredients are not recommended, because although such medicines have a great effect immediately after taking them, they often cause doctors to make obscure diagnoses due to extreme astringency, and the bacteria are deeply hidden in the mucosa, waiting for an opportunity to recur, which is the root cause of the disease. Therefore, internal medicines for gonorrhea should be rich in penetrating power and bactericidal power, so that they can penetrate deeply and achieve the effect of sterilization, such as the recent "Miesha Lin."</p>
<h3 id="e196">My Opinion on the Safe and Reliable Treatment of Gonorrhea <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Physician She Lei</p>
<p>After the human body is infected with gonorrhea, the initial discovery is in the urethra. Therefore, the treatment of gonorrhea cannot ignore local treatment. However, because gonorrhea is latent in the mucosal folds of the urethra, it is not entirely reliable to only perform local sterilization. Therefore, the treatment of gonorrhea must also include systemic therapy. In recent times, electrotherapy is rewarded, such as short-wave diathermy, which uses its heat and electricity to kill gonorrhea. The latest turbidity machine uses the light power of the machine to sterilize. If they are implemented in conjunction, it can be said that the history of non-recovery can at least be said to be the complete treatment of gonorrhea. In the past, local gonorrhea treatment methods generally used protein silver preparations. It goes without saying that their effects were not complete. Since "Lin Du Shu Le Er" and "Xue Li Fa Er" came out, people competed to buy and use them, and their value can be known. Among systemic therapies, simple vaccine used to be used for immunity, but now a mixed white turbid pulp vaccine is used. The level of effectiveness can be determined without divination. As for internal medicine therapies, in the past, they were preparations of "sandalwood oil" and "Copaba," etc. Now there are specially made drugs such as "Miesha Lin," which have strong bactericidal power and no astringent ingredients. In addition, for lymphotoxin diseases, diseases caused by gonorrhea, such as orchitis, arthritis, etc., although the cause must be traced and the cause treatment must be applied in treatment, according to personal experience, arsenic is indispensable in the administration of drugs.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Two Cases of Self-Treatment of Nocturnal Emission Cured <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Yuan Yimin</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang, 24 years old, complained that he had committed the bad habit of masturbation in the past, but he has now quit. However, he has been experiencing nocturnal emission for two or three years. The symptoms are: many dreams at night, nocturnal emission about once every few days, sometimes once every day, and sometimes twice a night. The morning after nocturnal emission, he feels heavy-headed, dizzy, and mentally tired. Treatment: He was given "An Er Shen" for internal use, a total of three boxes, and the disease disappeared as if it had never been there.</p>
<p>Mr. Lu, 32 years old, has always been physically weak. He was addicted to opium for years, but has quit for more than three years. However, he has had frequent nocturnal emissions in recent years, or even seminal emissions without dreams. He has consulted doctors many times, but none of them have been effective. This spring, he bought and took Chen's medicine, but it was also ineffective. Through Mr. Jin's introduction, he came to see me. Since he was from a remote rural area, it was inconvenient to make a long-term diagnosis. I ordered him to buy "An Er Shen" tablets for internal use. As of today, more than two months later, not only has the disease disappeared suddenly, but also his spirits are full, far better than before.</p>
<h3 id="e198">On Circumcision <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Cui Fuqing</p>
<p>The disease of overly long foreskin of the penis is very common. Circumcision is necessary if the foreskin is too tight and the glans cannot protrude, or if the foreskin is too long and the glans is completely covered. There is accumulation of dirt and filth, which easily leads to inflammation of the foreskin and glans, and it also hinders fertility. Circumcision should be performed. If the foreskin is slightly long and can still protrude upward, it seems that there is no need for circumcision. When performing this operation, local anesthesia is sufficient. In the past, some people advocated tying the root of the penis, and the injection of anesthetic liquid was mainly at the root of the penis. They did not know that tying the root of the penis would cause postoperative bleeding. Even the injection of anesthetic liquid is only necessary at the foreskin and the glans groove. It seems that there is no need to continue the injection at the root of the penis. There are many kinds of cutting methods, such as the triangular incision method, the V-shaped excision method, and the annular excision method. The operation is performed according to the shape of the penis. The fat inner layer of the skin should not be cut, for fear that the inner layer's moving pressure will be cut off and shrunk. It is difficult to find again, and bleeding will not stop. If the internal blood vessels have been cut off, they should be tied off immediately. When suturing, it must be meticulous and symmetrical. When bandaging, a pressure bandage must be applied, and then it must be held up with a T-shaped bandage. In this way, there is no postoperative bleeding and no other unwarranted pain.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Treatment of Acne <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Doctor Jiang Guofan</p>
<p>Young men and women, during the period of 15 or 16 years old to 25 or 26 years old, that is, during the period of development, often suffer from this disease. This disease is commonly known as acne. The areas where it occurs on the face are usually the cheeks, cheekbones, and nose. It is shaped like a black dot at the head of a hat pin. If you squeeze it hard, you will see a thin, long, or small gray fatty substance freely discharged. This is clearly a mixture of sebum, dander, and dirt. This disease is caused by sebaceous gland secretion disorder. The bottom layer of acne has small nodules where acne develops, and there are also several acne that are interconnected to form coarse strands of acne. Drugs for treating this disease include zinc oxide, boric acid, salicylic acid, etc. However, the impurities in the blisters must be squeezed out, washed clean, and then applied. "Miejuejun" is the holy product among skin treatment agents. In addition to containing excellent skin medicines for scabies, it is also equipped with zinc oxide, boric acid, salicylic acid, and other drugs. Used for the treatment of acne, it always achieves the effect of medicine working as soon as it is applied.</p>

<p>— Luo Xiuzhang</p>
<p>There is no pain in life greater than illness. The attack of diseases is indeed ubiquitous. Being ill is like being imprisoned, and there is no worse lingering and painful illness than stomach disease. I used to like alcohol, and I was not satisfied with every meal unless it was spicy. Three years ago, I suffered from acute gastritis, which was cured after treatment. Later, I could not tolerate avoiding spicy and stimulating foods, resulting in chronic gastric catarrh. It would be cured when it broke out, but it would still recur after recovery. Even when it did not break out, I was like a normal person, and there was nothing different in my diet and daily life. However, once it broke out, I would toss and turn in bed, and the pain was indescribable. This autumn, when I came to Shanghai, I learned that Dr. Sun Zhiyao was good at treating stomach diseases, so I rushed to him. As I was unable to stay in Shanghai for a long time, Dr. Sun introduced me to take "Wei Bao," a preparation of Yierjiali, which specializes in treating stomach diseases, and instructed me to take it on time even when it did not break out. I followed the method and took about three boxes before and after. It has been four months since then, and it has not recurred. It was truly unexpected. In addition to being grateful, I wrote this to promote it and benefit those with the same disease.</p>

<h3 id="e203">On Today's Opium Ban <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Xiong</p>
<p>In the late Qing Dynasty, Britain, under the cover of superior warships and cannons, imported large quantities of opium into our country, attempting to fundamentally eliminate the vitality of our nation. The Opium War resulted in the beginning of unequal treaties, reducing our country to a semi-colonial status. The late Lin Wenzhong Gong once said, "...This disaster, if not eradicated, in ten years, we will have no soldiers to use, and no funds to plan for... The scourge of opium spreads inland, like a boil poisoning the body; as a boil grows to pus, opium comes to lead to banditry..." How poignant are these words! All enlightened people have recognized that resisting poison is an urgent matter of internal affairs. Sun Yat-sen's anti-drug legacy also stated: "The public opinion of the Chinese people has never been opposed to opium. Anyone who advocates legalizing opium business or expresses surrender to the evil forces of opium is a public enemy of the people." "The declaration of war against opium must never be compromised. If responsible government agencies, for their own private interests, lower the flag and cease the war against opium, no matter how brief, it is an act of treason." These anti-drug propositions are particularly firm and concrete.</p>
<p>However, anti-drug and opium prohibition efforts have historically been intermittent, with little success. The reasons can be examined as follows: First, warlords seize power and fight among themselves internally, extorting military supplies from the people. Thus, they engage in rampant and violent taxation, coercing the planting of opium seedlings, drinking poison to quench thirst, in order to reap profits. Second, although successive rulers were also aware of the evils of the black scourge, the national treasury was empty and military expenses were enormous. Therefore, they had no choice but to implement the reality of publicly selling opium under the guise of "prohibition through taxation." Since the beginning of the Republic of China, how many times has opium prohibition been implemented? And at the beginning, it was often swift and vigorous, but in the middle, it would eventually be lifted, resulting in not only no achievements, but the spread of the drug scourge increasing day by day. Observing the increasing number of young people in their twenties who are newly addicted, one can see a glimpse of this problem?</p>
<p>Recently, according to reports, opium smokers in five provinces have already been registered and given a deadline to quit. In the future, if new addictions or relapses are discovered, they will be punished by military law. As for Shanghai, because it is a place where people from all directions gather and has concessions as a shield, it has always been a place to hide dirt and accommodate filth, making the implementation of opium prohibition the most difficult. However, according to reports, the registration of opium smokers in Shanghai has also ended. Afterwards, it remains to be seen what the methods and results will be.</p>
<p>In order to prevent this opium prohibition from repeating past mistakes, we hope that the opium prohibition authorities will pay attention to the following three points: First, those in charge of opium prohibition must absolutely lead by example. The four words "lead by example" are a prerequisite for all politicians, but they are especially important for those responsible for opium prohibition. Therefore, those in charge of opium prohibition must have absolutely no addictions themselves, so that orders can be issued and laws can be implemented without fear or timidity. Furthermore, they must not use this as a tool to enrich themselves, so as to avoid complaints from opium smokers.</p>
<p>Second, fines can never enable opium smokers to eliminate their addiction. Previously, in various counties of Jiangsu Province, the registration fee for opium smokers, except for the extremely poor who were charged six jiao per quarter, was generally six yuan in silver dollars. This small amount of money, although the authorities can use it for opium prohibition administration, is an unbearable burden for ordinary people under conditions of economic depression. Moreover, in the past, when opium smokers were caught, they were often not made to quit their addiction, but were merely fined. This is also a major cause of the failure of opium prohibition. The purpose of opium prohibition is to make people quit their addiction, so there is absolutely no way that a large registration fee or fine can make opium smokers quit. Moreover, wealthy opium smokers are simply not worried about not having money. If they have money, they can still smoke safely, which is completely contrary to the purpose of opium prohibition administration.</p>
<p>Third, after a specified minimum period, the source of opium and other poisons must be absolutely cut off. The temporary establishment and public operation of opium dens are intended to facilitate the quitting of old opium smokers. Since opium smokers have a set period for quitting, opium dens should also be abolished accordingly, and the source of opium and other poisons should be fundamentally cut off. Once the source is cut off, those who have quit will not relapse, and those who have not smoked will not develop new addictions. This is truly a fundamental solution, a way to remove the firewood from under the pot. However, this matter is of great importance. How should customs inspect and seize opium and other poisons? How should concessions be prevented from becoming places to hide drugs? If the government does not have the determination to address the root cause and does not use its entire political and diplomatic strategy to promote it, it will inevitably fail and make the future of today's opium prohibition less optimistic!</p>

<h3 id="e204">Parliament Buildings Around the World <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Si Ruo</p>
<p>The British Parliament: On the banks of the Thames in London stands a magnificent building that soars into the clouds, which is the British Houses of Parliament. This building was begun in the middle of the eleventh century by Edward the Confessor, the last English king of the Anglo-Saxon royal family. It was later expanded several times, gradually becoming a magnificent building. However, before the Industrial Revolution in Britain, or more precisely, before the emergence of British constitutional monarchy, this building was still used as a place of religious worship; it became the seat of the British Parliament after the establishment of constitutional monarchy in the British Empire.</p>
<p>The British Parliament has suffered several fires: the great fire of 1834 was the most severe, and the damage was naturally the greatest. However, in 1835, the British government designed and rebuilt it, spending a huge sum of 724,986 pounds, resulting in the largest parliament building in the world. This new parliament is naturally divided into two houses. The speaker's chair in the Lower House is at the north end; in front of the speaker's chair is the clerk's seat; the dark green Moroccan leather chairs throughout the hall are the seats of the members of parliament. The Upper House is even more impressive than the Lower House. Portraits of emperors of the British Empire and marble or bronze statues of many great politicians are displayed here; at its north end is a large tower 318 feet high, which is extremely magnificent; on top of the tower is a large clock, 23 feet in diameter and weighing 13 tons, which is probably the largest clock in the world.</p>
<p>The Capitol in the United States, second only to the British Parliament in scale, is the US Capitol Building.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>The United States Capitol was built by President Washington and is divided into two chambers: the Senate and the House of Representatives (Lower House). The Senate is composed of ninety-six senators, two elected by the legislature of each of the forty-eight states, and its function is to legislate. The House of Representatives, on the other hand, was first composed of sixty-five representatives in 1789. The chambers of these two houses are located in Washington, D.C., on a high ground 88 feet above the Potomac River. It faces the Potomac River to the west and overlooks the Anacostia River to the south, making it a first-class scenic spot in the US capital. Its architectural style is classical and has four floors.</p>
<p>Like the British Parliament, the US Capitol has also suffered several fires. In 1815, the government raised 500,000 US dollars in public debt to carry out renovations. By 1818, the central part was completed, and the construction of the Lower House was completed; by 1827, the entire Capitol was completed. However, it suffered another fire in 1851, and was subsequently renovated and expanded, and it was not until 1861 that it was completed in its current beautiful form. It is more than 750 feet long from north to south and about 350 feet wide from east to west, with a total area of six thousand four hundred and fifty feet. The Senate is 51 feet wide, 84 feet long, and has a ceiling height of 36 feet. The senators' seats are arranged in a semicircle with the lectern as the center; around the top of the chamber is a gallery, which is the visitors' gallery. The layout of the Lower House is also very beautiful, where you can see a bronze statue of the Goddess of Liberty.</p>
<p>The German Parliament: The German Parliament is composed of the Federal Council and the Reichstag, but the relationship between the two is not the ordinary relationship between the Upper House and the Lower House; the Federal Council represents the German states, and the Reichstag represents the German people, which can be said to be a unique feature of the German Parliament.</p>
<p>The German Parliament Building is located next to the central park of Tiergarten in Berlin, where there are large triumphal columns, the Imperial Opera House, fountains, and statues of Bismarck. However, due to the factional disputes in Germany, the German Parliament was burned down by arson by which faction is unknown and has not yet been restored.</p>
<p>In addition, there is the Prussian Parliament Building, which needs to be discussed here. This parliament building was completed in 1904, adjacent to the Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of the Army. The building is also divided into two chambers, with a total of four floors. The Upper House has a foundation area of 6,480 square feet, and the Lower House has a foundation area of six thousand two hundred and ninety square feet. The Upper House chamber is square, about 64 feet wide, 60 feet deep, and has a ceiling height of 36 feet. The Lower House chamber is rectangular, with 433 seats arranged in a semicircle; the visitors' gallery is around the top of the chamber; the imperial seat is in the center of the west, and the public seats are in the north. However, there is no parliamentary system in Germany and Prussia now, so this parliament building is just an architectural form and has no special significance.</p>
<p>The French Parliament: As seen in the "Oath of the Tennis Court" depicted by the painter David, the French Parliament was not originally built specifically as a place for parliamentary proceedings. The French Senate, the Upper House, is the Luxembourg Palace in Paris, and the House of Representatives is the former Bourbon Palace. The former was built from 1615 to 1620 by Marie de Medici, the queen of Henry IV, the founder of the Bourbon royal family; Louis Philippe added to it during his reign from 1830 to 1848, and it was not until the restoration of the republican government in 1875 that part of it was transformed into the Upper House chamber; at that time, the other part was still a museum, which was converted into a chamber in 1890. This chamber has three floors, the chamber is semicircular, and has 320 seats. The latter—the Bourbon Palace—was designed by the Italian architect Giardini and was begun in 1722. Later, it was the National Assembly chamber, and then it was used as the Lower House chamber, and it is still used today. It is located on the banks of the Seine River and has 602 seats. Both the Upper and Lower Houses are semicircular, and all the political disputes in France are now sharply expressed in these semicircular chambers.</p>
<p>The Swiss Parliament: Switzerland is a federation composed of 22 cantons, and its Federal Assembly is above the cantonal parliaments. It is also divided into two houses, the Upper House is composed of representatives of the cantons, and the Lower House is a representative body elected by the people. The cantonal parliaments all adopt a unicameral system. The entire administration of Switzerland is handled by a committee of seven members proposed by the Federal Assembly, with a term of three years.</p>
<p>The new Federal Parliament Building is located on Bundesgasse in Bern and is a five-story Italian Renaissance-style building, beautifully built with Molasse stone from Bern. This parliament building is a rare large rectangular rounded building among the world's parliament buildings, and it has a good effect on music. From here, you can see the Alps and many natural beauties of Switzerland, so it can also be considered a scenic spot.</p>
<p>The Austro-Hungarian Parliament: Before the war, Austria and Hungary were united as one country, collectively known as the Austro-Hungarian Empire. After the war, they were divided into two, and their politics naturally became independent of each other. Therefore, we must now explain the Austro-Hungarian parliament building separately.</p>
<p>The Austrian Parliament Building is Greek-style and is also divided into two chambers. The Lower House is on the right and the Upper House is on the left. In front of the Upper House gate are marble statues of gods, a large fountain, and large steel flagpoles on both sides. There are 208 seats in the Upper House and 616 seats in the Lower House. Speaking of decoration, it cannot be said to be very beautiful.</p>
<p>The Hungarian Parliament Building was originally the National Museum and was not designed and rebuilt as a parliament building until 1886. As a result, it took 18 years and 9,560,053 florins to complete this magnificent building. It is a five-story building, not only is the exterior very gorgeous, but the interior is also very elegant; the interior walls are decorated with marble.</p>
<p>In addition, other countries in the world also have parliament buildings, but because they are not very outstanding in architecture, I will not describe them one by one here.</p>
<p>A Week of Travel</p>
<h3 id="e205">A Pilgrimage to Tangshan <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Wen</p>
<p>I lived in Nanjing for two years before and after, and in the past two years I have often run there to linger for a few days, but I have never been to the famous Tangshan. Sometimes it was of course because of bad luck: too many things to do, bad weather, no mood, or lack of legal tender. But haven't I gotten tired of Xuanwu Lake, Yuhuatai, Qingliang Mountain, Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum, and Linggu Temple? So, the biggest reason for not going to Tangshan! It's still because I'm afraid: who doesn't know that Tangshan is a place for celebrities to rest? What am I? Don't fantasize about enjoying that famous sulfur spring. So, Tangshan in my mind is beautiful, luxurious, a paradise on earth, and a suitable place to rest. But this winter, I don't know how, I luckily went to Tangshan.</p>
<p>There were three of us, like every traveler, we got up at dawn. At seven o'clock, we took the car and set off, out of Zhongshan Gate, and walked a section along that beautiful mausoleum road, then parted ways and drove straight to Tangshan. The road was built along the hillside, looking like a narrow belt from a distance. Our car was sometimes on the slope and sometimes in the valley. Just over an hour later, we arrived at Tangshan. It turned out that it was only fifty li from Nanjing.</p>
<p>There is a road to Jurong and Hangzhou on the right. Opposite it is the park. Looking around, the friend who was pre-arranged to be the guide didn't come. This was the first time for all three of us to come here, what to do? So, we had to continue along the road for five li and find him in a magnificent school. I said to him at the beginning: "It looks like the advantages of Tangshan are probably not easy to see; on the other hand, this school is still majestic and towering. Don't just visit the school!"</p>
<p>"That's right," my friend smiled, "this school has already spent 2.5 million in construction costs. Look, the road to the gate hasn't been repaired yet. Who says it's not worth your visit? But you can talk about it after you visit Tangshan."</p>
<p>Tangshan is not a mountain, just like all the suburbs of Nanjing, it is just some undulating mounds of earth that meander around.</p>
<p>We followed our guide and walked across a small and dilapidated wooden bridge. Under the bridge was a very dirty stagnant water, I saw a woman washing a chamber pot and an old woman washing vegetables, working in the same water. And on the shore, at the head of this wooden bridge, two military police and policemen were pacing back and forth.</p>
<p>Crossing the bridge, turning left, not ten steps away, Taoyuan is on the right, this is near the famous hot spring bathhouse and inn, which cannot be found in big cities. There are a few cars sparsely outside Taoyuan, looking very desolate.</p>
<p>Taoyuan and those inn pies are all built next to the small hill—Tangshan. We walked in, and the waiter greeted us to the rest room. This is good, there are carpets, tablecloths, stoves, pre-Qingming and sparrow tongue tea, coffee and milk, toast, and ice cream. There are also separated small rooms, the decoration inside is even more gorgeous, I saw a crimson velvet tablecloth, and all the sofas are embroidered with gold thread on velvet. In such a small room, a young couple came out. The man wore a badge and the woman held a hot water bottle. My guide friend said to me: "Look, this woman is from Qinhuai River, this man, judging by the badge, is from the Ministry of..."</p>
<p>"Is that possible?" I was surprised, "In Nanjing, is it possible for civil servants? What's more, in Tangshan, he can easily run into his superiors."</p>
<p>"You are too silly!" my friend smiled confidently, "Now senior officials rarely come here to bathe. Look over there," he led me out of the room, pointed to a large villa not far from here; over here, it is... now the officials all go to bathe there."</p>
<p>Naturally, we all went to bathe in the hot springs. The bathroom is a small bungalow, dilapidated and old. Inside are separate small rooms. Walking in, the steam hit my face, and the stuffy heat was really like entering a Turkish-style steam bath.</p>
<p>The bathhouse is built of granite, and is a square, almost a swimming pool - I say swimming pool, is to compare its size, really, like people like us who can't swim, but with a volume as big as a child, we can definitely swim in here. I walked down the stone steps, and looking at it, this pool is almost as deep as a swimming pool.</p>
<p>The water was too hot and the sulfur smell was too strong. I looked for the faucet and found one - only one very large one, installed at the top of the swimming pool. I tried to turn it on, but it was the same boiling hot water. No cold water, what to do? So, I sat quietly on the stone steps and waited, waiting for the temperature of the water to gradually, slowly decrease...</p>
<p>Afterwards, the guide told me: "This is not as good as the hot springs in Beiping, let alone the Beibei hot springs in Chongqing, Sichuan. Not to mention that the water source here is not as large as those two places, and the temperature is not as suitable as those two places." He thought for a while and added: "I heard that because the water source here is not large, they store the spring water at night and usually, and then burn it when they need to use it. Furthermore, bathing here always feels a bit too expensive and a bit too vulgar. One bath per person, including tea and tips, costs more than two yuan. Beiping only costs more than five jiao, and Chongqing is even cheaper, only more than one jiao, and sometimes it's free."</p>
<p>We all walked out disappointedly. No mountains, no water, no buildings, no scenery, how can it be called Tangshan? And how can it be so famous?</p>
<p>I really wanted to go for a walk in the park opposite, thinking that it could compensate for our disappointment. But my guide said again: "Saying to visit the park is better to say to look at the park! You just have to look at it at the door. Look, this is it: from the door, a straight, fine sand road, with plane trees and impatiens on both sides. After walking through the park, it's still a straight road, plane trees, impatiens. Do you want to study plane trees and impatiens?"</p>
<p>We all smiled wryly and dragged our guide back to Nanjing. The car sped along the road, we were all depressed, bowed our heads, and didn't say a word, only the guide was still laughing with great interest. Suddenly, one of my companions said: "All the famous places in Nanjing are very famous, but you can only know about them, never go to see them, definitely, never go..."</p>

<h3 id="e206">How to Cultivate One's Words and Deeds <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yi</p>
<p>Thought, speech, and action are the three primary processes of human life activity. It can also be said that these three constitute the overall process of human life activity. However, thought is unspoken language; it is merely talking to oneself in the mind. Therefore, as long as it has not developed to the stage of words and deeds, it does not have any impact on one's own life or the life of society. However, speech and action are different because they are public expressions of human activity. Therefore, their influence will inevitably affect society and one's own life. It can also be said that they are directly responsible to oneself and society. We cannot but be especially careful and strive for their correctness. Because of this, cultivating one's own words and deeds becomes something that one must strive to achieve.</p>
<p>But, how should we cultivate our own words and deeds? Here, let's briefly discuss a few major conditions.</p>
<p>Every individual naturally first requires that their words and deeds be correct and appropriate. But how can one make words and deeds reach the point of being correct and appropriate? Naturally, establishing one's own correct worldview and view of life is the most fundamental condition, using the enrichment of correct theory to erect the proper signs for our words and deeds, as a guide for our navigation in the vast sea, and using this to enrich its content. Although this condition is very important, the reason is very simple. Because thought resides</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>, but a person's words and deeds are led by their thoughts, to say and do according to what they think, this is natural. Since this is the case, then, to have correct words and deeds, one must first have a correct worldview and view of life in thought, have correct theories. When distorted theories are made public as arguments and actions, then the words and deeds are still distorted. This, and the distorted thought and theory underlying distorted words and deeds, are both inevitable realities of logic. Because of this, if a person wants to avoid making mistakes in their speech and conduct, then it is necessary to work hard on the study of basic theories, especially the latest philosophy and social sciences. Because there you can be given a correct worldview and view of life, and you can be taught correct theories. Without theory, not only will there be no correct action, but without theory, even correct and substantive words cannot be spoken. Based on this, we can answer that if you want to cultivate your words and deeds well, then the study of new theories is necessary.</p>
<p>Theory is naturally important, but to cultivate our words and deeds correctly, we also need rich life experience. We cannot neglect the life experience of trying to learn to swim. Experience not only verifies the correctness of theory, but also develops knowledge, guiding knowledge to develop to new stages. Experience is the enrichment of the content of life. We must have life experience for our words to have content, to be reasonable and substantial. We also need experience to make our actions less prone to errors and more powerful, because rich life experience can reduce hesitation and protracted psychological states in our actions, making our actions decisive and resolute. Thus, if we want to cultivate our words and deeds well, then it is very necessary to experience actual life more. And experience is also the practice of action, so striving for practice, like striving for theoretical research, will make our speech and actions progress day by day.</p>
<p>Secondly, we should pay attention to the proper adjustment of our words and deeds. The most important aspect of the so-called proper adjustment of words and deeds is to eliminate the absolute contradiction between our words and deeds, so that they can be consistent. In today's society, it can be said that almost the majority of people do not act according to their words. They often say one thing but do not practice what they have said. What they say is this, is this matter, but what they do is that, is another matter, even their words are exactly the opposite of their actions, contradicting themselves. Many politicians are like this. When they talk or give speeches, their words are high-sounding and selfless, they say that everything is for society and the public, but in reality, their actions are not like that, but only for the private interests of themselves or their social class. For example, when a certain country launches a war of aggression against a weak nation, those politicians, warlords, and plutocrats tell their people that this is for their nation, country, and even the working masses, but in reality, such a war is launched only for the benefit of a few plutocrats. And as a result of the aggression, the people not only do not gain any benefit, but bear the increased burden of military expenses and go to the battlefield as cannon fodder. Another example is Mussolini's invasion of Abyssinia, which was the same trick being performed. From this, we can see that most people in today's society negate and contradict their words and deeds. When we cultivate our words and deeds, we must always pay attention to the consistency of our words and deeds, how we say it, we must do it, and what we do should be done according to what we have said. Do not just make grand statements in speech, issuing some deceitful and unfulfilled statements, but slapping yourself in the face with your actions. This consistency of words and deeds is by no means just a matter of personal honesty and private morality, but a political and social moral necessity. Therefore, for the training of words and deeds, it is also necessary to pay attention to cultivating them to be consistent with each other and not contradictory. Of course, we are not saying that in any case, such words and deeds must be absolutely consistent and must not contradict each other. For example, one should not be honest with one's enemies in every situation, just as a doctor should not tell a patient that the medicine is bitter and the illness will not get better, etc. But if there is no need for your words and deeds to contradict each other in the interests of the public, you should absolutely not allow them to fall into contradiction.</p>
<p>To cultivate our words and deeds, we must not only make our words and deeds able to adjust to each other, but also make our words and deeds able to adjust to the environment. This means that when we speak and act, we should pay attention to the changes in time and space, pay attention to the changes in the environment, and pay close attention to what to say, to whom, in what environment, and what things to do. If the time, space, and environment change, then your words and deeds must also change accordingly, so that they are appropriate and suitable in every situation, not contrary to the object, contrary to the times, or inconsistent with the environment. This point seems to be very ordinary, but it can be said that few people in society can do this. Most people do not see the object clearly before speaking and acting, and even less do they assess the environment, time, and space, what to say and what to do in what time, place, and situation. Therefore, their words and deeds, in a small way, become inappropriate, and in a big way, become words and deeds that violate the times and trends. Because of this, we should pay attention to our words and deeds, strictly cultivate our words and deeds at all times, so that they can be free from contradiction, so that they can adjust to the environment, so that they do not become words and deeds that are out of place or even contrary to the times.</p>
<p>Finally, the cultivation of the techniques of speech and action is also necessary. For example, how to express my theories in concise language, when expressing the central meaning and important points in my speech, what different tones or different speeds of speech should be used to express it, etc., these are the questions that great orators often pay attention to. The same is true in action. Because of the different objects and environments, there are times when there is a distinction between rapid advance and gradual advance, and we should adopt circuitous paths or direct action forms according to the needs of the environment. Naturally, although these are all technical issues, they are not as important as paying attention to cultivating our words and deeds from the basic theoretical principles mentioned above, but they are also necessary. We should also pay attention to these techniques at all times to cultivate our words and deeds, so that we can become a perfect speaker and actor, and make our words and deeds perfect.</p>
<p>World Oddities</p>
<p>— Da</p>
<p>Selling a Husband</p>
<p>In your esteemed country, it is common for husbands to sell their wives, however, Chinese people rarely hear of women selling their husbands! But believe it or not, recently in America, there was a woman who publicly sold her husband. This woman is named Mrs. Polette Cords. She lives in New York. It is said that because she wants to return to Ireland, she needs a lot of travel expenses, so she had the brilliant idea of selling her husband. The asking price she asked for is not too much, but it cannot be said to be too little, it is one thousand five hundred American dollars! When she sold her husband, she also publicly stated that whoever could give her one thousand five hundred American dollars, she would cede all her rights to her husband.</p>
<p>Venomous Snakes Escape</p>
<p>At a zoo outside Chicago, nineteen venomous snakes escaped from their cages. Among them were three poisonous snakes from Egypt, and anyone bitten by them would die immediately. Therefore, after this incident occurred, there was a major commotion inside and outside the zoo. As a result, one snake bit an outsider, and another snake captured a child; as for those snakes that escaped, they were all found with the help of the police, with the exception of two large sand snakes that have not yet been found. Because of this incident, the woman who managed the snakes in the zoo was fired. This fired woman said:</p>
<p>"I didn't mean to commit a careless crime. I forgot to close the door after cleaning the snake cage, I just forgot. I can't do everything at the same time. Now, the sand snake may be hiding in the water pipes, but it is definitely not poisonous. Now, the sand snake is living in the best place. If the people of the world had half the kindness of snakes, the world would already be peaceful."</p>
<p>Some people say that this woman is very foolish and that she is talking nonsense, do you think it is right?</p>
<p>Organization of Prostitutes</p>
<p>One evening, on the red-light street in Mexico City, passers-by did not see any prostitutes and were very surprised. But according to the newspapers the next day, it was said that those women who sold laughter had gone to a meeting that night. It is said that there were a total of four hundred of them, and they gave speeches at the meeting. As a result, they elected officers and issued a manifesto, stating that if their demands were not allowed, they would implement a solidarity strike. Their manifesto stated:</p>
<p>"We are exploited by landlords, quarantine doctors, and police officers, and we also make money for clothing stores. We no longer have hope for renewal... The government has recognized our right to organize for our own interests, we must form a true organization to defend our principles."</p>
<p>This organization is called SPM, and after its establishment, it decided to implement an eight-hour "work" system.</p>
<p>Reasons for Pardon</p>
<p>A total of one hundred and fifty-one prisoners were suddenly released from New York prisons. These prisoners were all foreigners, with Italians being the most numerous, accounting for sixty-two people. The crimes they committed were either trafficking in drugs, fraud, theft, or even murder. Officials announced that the reason for pardoning them was that, under the merciful heart of the President, they wanted to enable them to return to their respective countries and engage in legitimate occupations according to their talents. However, according to reliable sources, the reason for this pardon may not be as the officials stated, but in reality, it was aimed at reducing the expenses of the prison.</p>
<p>In fact, if these one hundred and fifty-one foreign prisoners were kept in prison, each person would cost ninety-five cents per day, totaling fifty-two thousand American dollars per year. Now, under the austerity policy of the American government, in order to reduce the expenditure of fifty-two thousand American dollars per year, these one hundred and fifty-one prisoners were pardoned. If the austerity policy of the American government is related to the American economic crisis and financial difficulties, then these one hundred and fifty-one pardoned prisoners should be especially grateful for the economic crisis and financial difficulties.</p>

<h3 id="e207">Special Salesmen <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Ze Xiang</p>
<p>The more depressed the market is, the more business methods there are. In the past, general stores employed "salesmen" with the sole purpose of soliciting transactions between businesses in the same industry; but recently, because competition between them has become increasingly fierce, a type of person called "special salesman" often appears before our eyes.</p>
<p>The life of this "special salesman" is indeed quite interesting to talk about, and it can be said that this is a new emerging profession that exists only in Shanghai, the New York of the East. Initially, there were not many people engaged in this profession, and the scope of their activities was not wide, so it did not attract much attention; but now it is different. We can see their traces on trams, on roads, and even sitting at home. Undoubtedly, they have opened up a new way of life in this complex Shanghai society in another form.</p>
<p>"Special salesman", also known as salesperson, first appeared in general pharmacies, using them to promote "Jintan", at that time, the number was not large, so unemployed friends did not feel much interest in this profession; but the general pharmacies that used "special salesmen" achieved success in sales, so later, general large stores and department stores with unique products followed suit, and began to use this kind of "special salesman". According to the "special salesmen" we encounter daily, there are about thirty or forty, such as Sincere, Wing On, Kwong Sang Yuen, Tai Kang, China Industrial Society, China National Goods Company, etc., most of them have this kind of long-term employed "special salesman", and sometimes when they create novel products, they have to temporarily add them.</p>
<p>"Special salesman" has now formed a profession, as mentioned earlier; but under the same name, there are various distinctions between temporary salesman and long-term salesman, and between commission salesman and buy-out salesman. Temporary salesman mostly only has short-term work, and the goods they promote are limited to one or two new products; when this new product is promoted to become popular, they also declare unemployment at the same time. Long-term salesman are more "carefree", their employment period is mostly longer, like the employees in the company, with one year as the minimum service period, constantly taking on the current task of promotion, whether it is a new product or an existing product, as soon as it needs to be promoted, they have to bring this product outside to promote. Commission salesman have a slightly different nature from the previous two kinds of salesman; the length of work of this kind of salesman is quite uncertain, because they do not receive a salary from the company. As for the buy-out salesman, it is a kind of work that requires a little capital to do; the relationship between this kind of salesman and the product company is almost the same as the relationship between a small vendor and a trading company. They take the money to the company to pick up the goods, wholesale them, and then promote them to the outside. But sometimes they can also borrow money from the company, sell the goods and then repay the money, but this kind of method requires the individual to have credit with the company or have a solid store guarantee before it can be done.</p>
<p>It is said that there are several hundred people working as "special salesman" now, both men and women; but most of them are some merchants who used to be old-fashioned salesman or engaged in small businesses, and not many new members are seen. The conditions that a "salesman" should have are: first, they must be good at eloquence, and they must describe a not-so-good product as noble as "something that exists only in heaven and not on earth". Secondly, the skin must be "thick", and the attitude towards strangers or acquaintances must be the same as usual; when they arrive at a place where a crowd is gathered, no matter how many people there are, when it is time to open their mouths to publicize, they have to recite aloud without scruples, and do their sales work.</p>
<p>As for the living treatment they receive, the monthly salary of a temporary salesman is only about twenty or thirty yuan, and occasionally it exceeds this number, but the monthly tram pass of four yuan must be taken out of the income. Most of the car expenses of long-term salesman are paid by the company, but the salary is not as much as that of temporary salesman; according to the general situation, the salary of a long-term salesman is at most about twenty yuan. Commission salesman also pay for their own car expenses; the amount of monthly income depends on the success of the sales, simply speaking, it is a "commission" system; but some companies are more polite, and they are willing to subsidize a part of the car expenses. As for the situation of the buy-out salesman, it is very different; he is taking capital to do business, and he can not be restricted in any way in terms of work, but the amount of monthly income also depends on the sales performance. Generally, the monthly income of a buy-out salesman is never less than twenty yuan. In addition, there is a kind of female salesman, their treatment is much better than the above four kinds of male salesman; because this group of female salesman are mostly well-educated, and the goods they promote and the ways of promotion are also different from them; most of their goods are sold directly to general residences. This kind of talent not only needs to have the skills of a salesman, but also needs to have an "outstanding" appearance; fashionable clothing is of course an indispensable condition. Therefore, most companies and stores adopt a monthly salary system for this group of female salesman, so that they can promote without any worries, and even some of the chartered cars that some female salesman sit in are also the responsibility of the company. Their monthly income per person is at least more than thirty yuan; and some special products or daily beverages (such as milk) require people with medical knowledge to be responsible for promotion, and the income of this type of female salesman is probably not less than sixty yuan per month.</p>

<p>Letter</p>
<p>To the editor, having read Mr. Wang Liu's article "Artistic Chirp Society Dissolved Invisibly" in your newspaper on the 9th of this month, after the reorganization of our society, we have spared no effort in the development of the society's affairs, and we will soon be broadcasting on various radio stations. We are afraid that the outside world will not know the truth and will misunderstand, so we specially write to correct it. We hope that it will be published at the end of the newspaper. We are very grateful. We hereby send this message, and we invite the editor to write a letter of appreciation.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Shanghai Artistic Chirp Society</p>
<p>Editor: (Omission) But the facts must be stated. Miss Leah and I only have some shallow friendship; and the editing of the broadcast world is appointed by the museum, pushing and accepting the plate is even more nonsense. I don’t want to say more about other things. Please publish the letter as it is in the future, so as to conform to the facts. Sincerely, Qi Zhuanan</p>

<p>Child star Shirley Temple has not had a new film come to China for a long time since the release of "Little Miss Marker". A group of fans who love this little sweetheart have not forgotten her. Recently, I heard that her latest work, Littlcst Rebel, has arrived in Shanghai and has been transported to Beijing for inspection. The translated name is "Little Heroine", and it will soon be released in Shanghai. It is also said that Shirley Temple's acting skills in this film have even more amazing achievements.</p>
<p>Will Rogers has the reputation of being a master of humor on the screen, but because most of his humor is in the dialogue, it is not very interesting for our Chinese audience who do not understand English very well. However, in "Steamboat ToRund he Beud", which is showing at Cathay, he focuses on action, and everything in the film is quite in line with the tastes of the Chinese people. This is Will Rogers' last creation, and it is also our last chance to appreciate the art of the master of humor.</p>
