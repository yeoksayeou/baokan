<p>當一八八五年中法和議後遊華日人有懼中國積極圖强三年後日必不敵者伊藤博文則謂「中國不足畏法事甫定似乎奮發有爲一二年後則又因循苟安而入睡矣」嗣後伊藤之言果騐日人之觀察中國者多服膺之雖然此未可持以論一二八戰役後中國之人心也中國自二十一年一二八英勇之抗戰失敗有不斷之事實敎訓使人觸目以驚心有遺留之烈士英風足以振頑而立懦今日之中國國民固多已淸醒澈悟懷有衛國之正確意志其所以未能有濟於國難則準備工作之欠缺爲之耳</p>
<p>記者猶憶當年追悼淞滬抗日陣亡將士大會告全國書中有云「在此决戰役中同人深感新式戰具之缺乏與犧牲之重大竊以現代戰爭日趨於機械化奮勇肉搏乃奮時代之往事而戰備之機械化乃現代社會工業化之結果」夫當年抗戰諸烈士不以缺乏新式戰具自餒奮勇肉搏蒙重大之犧牲而不顧誠令人每一回憶精神爲之振奮知欲解救國難仍當賡續諸先烈之犧牲精神然爲現代機械化之國防有所憑藉計則盡力促進社會工業化實爲全國國民之責任此亦吾國人在尚有準備時間之條件下所當認識者也</p>
<p>一二八戰役陣亡諸先烈有英勇之犧牲事實以發舒其衛國之意志固予吾民族精神以莫大之激勵但以國家社會缺乏機械化戰具之供給卒難挽當年之頹勢今之紀念陣亡將士者允宜賡續其衛國之意志分別埋頭於事實上之凖備工作卽不能爲國家而流血亦當爲國家而流汗集全國人之心力積以時日效當可見先烈有知亦可稍慰矣</p>
<p>所謂準備工作乃指促進社會工業化而言已如上述而現代之工業實有賴於現代之科學其他如農商各業亦無不與有相當之聯繫故今日之下國人倘不自怠則救國之準備工作各有其可以致力之處記者不敏臨此沉痛之紀念日愧無以慰先烈之靈惟就所見略述一二以告有志衛國之國人</p>

<p>一，身體强健之意義在講强健身體的方。以前，先要解釋身體强健的意義。因爲意義和方法有聯帶的關係，意義不同，方法也就不同了。尋常所謂强健不外兩種意義，第一點是屬於消極方面，就是身體沒有病，各種器官多在正常狀態之中。第二點是屬於積極方面，就是一人胃口好，睡得着，身體有力量，做事有精神，不易疲癆而且覺得愉快。從這兩點看來，第一點實在就是健康，第二點就是身體發達。所謂身體强健的意思，就不外這兩方面。</p>
<p>二，强健身體之方法上節旣然把强健的意思分成健康和發達兩種，則强健身體的方法就這兩方面着想就是了。第一點積極强身的方法，就是講究體育。體育的功用不是專爲强身，但要强身須講究體育，實行操練，從事運動。操練或運動的時候，非用身體運動身體，就是身體運動物件。例如體操及器械運動是身體運動身體，球類運動是身體運動物件。兩種運動都要用力量，因爲用力量，肌肉本身應運動或操練的要求，就增加織維的數目，於是肌肉發遠了，力量也就變大了。又因運動的時候，身體肌肉裹起化學的作用，就是身體裏的養料（屬於炭水化物之食物）和養氣化合。運動愈多，用的養料和養氣也愈多。人們常常從事運動，則吸收養料的器官如消化器，吸養氣的器官如呼吸器，都發達了。輸送養氣和運送養料的器官如循環器官也就發達了。又運動之後發生許多廢料，如尿素炭酸氣等，不得不由一秤器官專做運去的工作，所以排泄器官也從此發達了。此外運動的時候，因運用肌肉，肌肉的活動受神經的管理，　動愈複雜而愈機巧，神經與肌肉調恊的工夫也愈複雜，所以運動能促進神經系統的發展。從此看來，鍜鍊身體從事運動，結果可使身體靈敏，力量增大，食量增加，心肺及內　其他各器官如肝胰腎大小腸胃等皆變强壯。欲達這種目的，一人每日須做相當的運動。據美國體育專家吼善靈頓氏（Helhernston）研究的結果，小學生每日至少須有四小時活動，中學生每日須有二三小時活動，成人每日須有一小時的活動。若一人因職業關係，不能多做運動，平均每日至少須做三十分鐘的活動，或隔日行一點鐘的活動。活動的種類很多，選擇的方法要看個人的技能·興味·經濟狀况。及習慣等要素來决定。一人若對於田徑運動球類等從未學過，則年輕者可以從事學習，年老者只能擇簡易之運動行之。如吾國年過四十之人能打網球·高爾夫球最好，不能則打太極拳·或練習他種拳衛也好，若不好拳術，星期日到野外爬山也子。一人若對於某一種運法動有與味，就做那種運動。例如德國人嗜器運動，有年過六十尚做器械運動者。一人若有經濟力量能買高雨夫球棍築高爾夫球場，也不妨從吾所好而爲之。惟最緊要者，一人對於一種運動須有相當之技能，技能好與味亦隨之而起。又一人要身體終身强健，須終身保持運動和　練，要能終身保持操練而不間斷，須有運動的習慣和興趣。此種運動的習慣和與趣，不是從老來養成，乃是從年輕時候好動大性發現的時候培養成的。若年輕的時候沒有養成，到年長了是不成的，猶之貓好捕鼠的習慣和技能，從幼時前脚玩球練習來的。小時不學，老來就沒有那種習慣。所以中小學體育是很重要，運動的習慣和與味都要在那時養成。現在社會上一般人，對於運動不會而沒有興趣的人，都是從前對於學校體育不講究的綠故。這般人要强健身體，惟有决心擇一種運動努力練習，學打網球也好，學太極拳也好，如有高爾夫球場學打高爾夫球也好。</p>
<p>此外身體之不强健，由於一人多用精力，神經系統少休息，和其他各器官之功能退化的綠故。大家要明白，一人坐在公事房辦公，在圖書館看書，或書房裏寫文章，雖然不喘氣，心不跳快，四肢也不動，但是消費的精力極多，如一人連夜用功，寫文章或讀書，能致血聚在腦中陲眠不着。此外還有種種很危險的現象，如消化不良，胃口不好，身體裏的養料的消耗之無限制，終至身體虧弱，形容憔悴，這都是不强健的表示。一人若從事運動，可以把用心時提到腦中去的血液引到肌肉裏去，腦中所縈思的問題可以從此忘却，如是睡眠也容易了，胃口也開了，精神也省了，所以要身體强健，還要用運動來調節身心。一人的事業愈大，則身體的强健愈需要。昔曾文正公以戡亂平難爲己任，每日須靜坐三十分鐘，飯後綏步五五步，靜坐有節省精力之意義，緩步有運動的意味。當時因爲體育未及提倡，士大夫不知道運動，但會文正公却早已實踐體育的訓練了。現在我們已經知道幾十種運動，不能拿運動來强健身體，來消費我們的時間，反有人用嫖賭等傷害身體的活動來消遺，眞是可惜。今日是講積極方面强身的方法，還有積極方面的衛身的方法，與强健身體有密切的關係，俟下一决再講。</p>
<p>第二點消極方而强健身體方法，就是講究衛生，因爲衛生與體育須相輔而行，缺一不可。有體育而不講衛生，可將體育所訓練的效果，破壞盡凈，例如體力極充足，精神極活潑之運動好手，飮食不愼，吃不消化的食物，喝不淸潔的凉水，傳染到傷寒症或痢疾，於是身體萎頓，精神减色，所謂强健的體格，那時巳不復見了。所以衛生和體育是互相維持身體强健的。衛生的方法究屬如何？可以把牠分成幾方面來講。</p>
<p>衛生的習慣　這就是一人尋常飲食起居工作休息等整個生活的習慣，對於身體的影響較大。這也可以分幾方面來講。</p>
<p>甲，飲食的習慣　飲食爲精力之源，食物得當，足以養身，食物不得當足以害身，食物之足以應吾人的需要的有三大類，其一爲蛋白質（就是肉類，鷄蛋等）道種食品一人每日二百克已足，稱多亦不妨，惟過多則仍由腎中排去，因蛋白質除補身體之組織以外，不能存留在身體中。有的人好多吃肉類，腎的負担太重，足以傷腎。昔袁世凱每日須吃鴨一隻，終因腎病而死。袁氏有矮胖之體格，是屬於側寬式一類，這類易於生腎病，一方面亦囚多吃肉而然。所以矮胖的人，食物應少食肉類，多吃素菜。第二類食物爲炭水化物，就是飯·麵·糖之類。這種食物如多吃而能消化，則能儲蓄在體內，若吃得太多，則不易於消化，或即能消化，其人亦將萎靡不振，因爲血都到胃中做消化的工作去了。第三類食物爲脂肪，就是奶油。猪油。豆油等，這類食物，消化之後，功用與炭水化物相同，但是多吃不易消化，允共用油炸的食物，不宜多吃，如油條之類，多吃是不衛身的。此外還有所謂護生素，尋常叫維他命，牠們兆有五種，不是獨立存在，往往含在食物中問。維他命Ａ存在脂肪中，如牛油·魚肝油之類，亦有存在紅蘿葡·菠菜中的，可是猪油中一點也沒有。不吃這類護生素，易生結膜炎等病。維他命B，是存在種子裏面和動物的卵裏面，米太白，這種維太命就被磨去了。一人吃不到這種維他命，要生神經炎，脚氣病，維他命C，存在柑橘蕃茄蔬菜中，若不吃這種維他命，耍生貧血，口膜流血，及虛弱症和壞血等症。維他命D，存於牛油及植物脂肪中，小兒不吃這種維他命，要生軟骨病。還有維他命E，存於蛋黃，蒿苣和肝中，不吃牠，就不會生殖。所以一人的食物要吃得平均，各種必需的養生質，都不可少。許多人的飲食專揀好吃的吃，實在不好吃而對身體有益的，也不得不吃一點。還有許多人好吃零星食物，足以敗壞胃口，講究衛生的人，這重不良習貫，絕對不可養成。還有吃飯的時候，有的人吃得很快、也是不好，因爲有一部份食物如米飯之類，在口中消化，有一部份如肉類油類，在腸胃裏消化，吃得慢，嚼得砟，則消化液容易消化牠而且消化液可以出得多，消化更易。所以吃飯須有多嚼而慢吃的習慣。此外飮料方面，水宜多喝，一天至少四斤，其他如酒咖啡之類，不宜多喝。</p>
<p>乙，排泄的習慣就是大便的習慣，大便每日至少一决或兩决。最好在早晨或者飲後。早晨在家庭中或在寓處，成了習慣不易忘却。中午或晚上出外辦公或應酬，易於忘却。但是成了習慣之後，則　時而來，絕不遲緩。一人希望養成習慣，最好到一定時間，（早晨或飯後）去上厠，積久則有排除之感覺，不必用意志來管理了。大便所以需每日來的緣故，因爲糞積腸中，易於腐敗，而生腸靛素及糞臭素，使一人的抵抗力减低容易發生他種疾病。</p>
<p>丙，睡眠的習慣　睡眠是休息最充分的方法。一人坐在花園中或茶坊中間雖然亦算休息，但多少用些腦經和肌肉的力量。至於睡眠的時候，身體上各處肌肉，全部放鬆，腦經也停止工作。即使白天十分疲勞，若能熱睡八九小時，疲勞完全可以恢復。所以一個人希望身體强健，睡眠是很要緊。最好養成到十點鐘或十一點鐘一定睡着的習慣，到明日六七點鐘一定起床的習慣。若一人有嗜好。好跳舞，好打牌，通宵達且的幹，身體一定吃大虧。雖然做運動來强健身體，也是全無效果的。此外還有應附帶注意的事項，就是睡時，被勿蓋到面上，並且還要把窗子開一二扇，因爲空氣淸鮮，睡得好些。</p>
<p>丁，淸潔的習慣　這包括很多，最靈要者，爲早晨飯後之刷牙，因爲食物殘屑存在齒間可以腐化而發生酸質，易使牙齒腐爛，爛後即痛，痛則非補非拔不可，即能補好，亦不易持久不壞。牙壞則消化不良，營養不得充足，與身體强健有直接關係。所以這種刷牙的習慣，不能不養成。食前洗手的習慣，外國人極爲注意，因爲外人吃麵包都用手抓的綠故，吾國人用箸代手，雖然手不直接取物，亦有用到手的地方，若手不潔凈，微生物易入口中，非常危險。所以食前洗手的習慣，也應養成的。此外還有浴身的習慣，皮膚是排泄機關時時排泄脂肪汙素等，不洗浴，則排泄不暢。所以夏天每日應洗浴，冬天至少一星期一决。</p>
<p>戊，工作與休息的習慣　吾人爲生活起見不能不做工作，最好一人的工作，每天都有規定，工作滿時，則事休息或遊散。一人終日用功或做事而不休息，精神消耗太多，身體即爲之虧損。所以做滿幾時，應即休息。休息時或遊公園或與友人出城外遊覽，或登山以調養身心。</p>
<p>己，運動的習慣　此即上節積極的强身方法。如每天按時做運動，或每天做一次運動，也無不可。</p>
<p>以上甲，乙，丙，丁，戊，己六種習慣，可以包括一人尋常之生活，還有特別的事項想要身體强健者，亦不可不知道的，就是以下一項。</p>
<p>防傳染病之常識　傳染病有好幾種，有幾種是極危險的，如傷寒症。天花。白喉。霍亂。猩紅熱。現在醫藥很進步，天花不必說，早巳發明牛痘，餘如傷寒症·白喉·霍亂·猩紅熱，都有預防針可打。打後雖然不能絕對不受傳染，但是比不打好得多。如一人己患傳染病，如白喉。霍亂之後，須趕速送醫院醫治，使共與家庭最好隔離以防傳染家人。</p>
<p>此外還有關於公共衛生常識，直接或間接對於人生都有關係。限於時間，不暇細講，完了。</p>

<p>南京盛極一時　開賽時華北以北平隊先行應戰、竟然全非南京之廠、一任南京蹂躪、全無還手餘力、王士選先開紀錄後、鮑文沛迭建巨功、一中再中、竟造成十比零之數、至此華北才開紀錄、然所得有限、王玉增又出入籃下、比數成二十二對八、</p>
<p>津隊登塲作戰　天津隊不不能再行坐視、全軍更易、南京之攻勢驟减、徐兆熊沈聿恭劉寳成、亦相率入籃、上半時之結果、為二十七比十六、比數稍見接近、然二十三比十時、南京後衛主將趙志華罰出、蕭保源不克繼其業、實為南京致命之傷、</p>
<p>華北二度超出　下半時天津隊大舉進攻、一連獲中五球之多、其勢可怕、僅以二十六比二十七落後一分、京隊舉步艱難、王玉增隨手一揮、才以遠射中的、沈劉二鋒又突中二球、華北頓以三十比二十九、作第二度之超出、</p>
<p>相差一分惜敗　王玉增第二次之遠射、雖吿成功、華北又見直上、以八分估先、京隊陣綫、散漫不克、全恃各個作戰、及遠射進取、四十二比三十四對、華北李紹唐罰出、四十四比三十八對尹煤文罰出、華北險象、又呈眼前、京隊鮑文沛改從中路進取、連中兩球、比數成四十七比四十六、僅差一分、然已吿終局、京隊惜敗、</p>

<p>港滬西人聯合隊與高麗隊、昨日下午三時在申園作友誼賽、觀者四五千人、惟塲地泥濘、影響兩隊賽力不少、高麗隊員奔跑迅速、搶球賣力、勇敢精神、為他隊所不及、惟傳遞不準、輒失之交臂、或舉足無力、或未踢先倒、否則當不致失敗、守門身材矮小、技術欠精、所立地位不當、首失二球、守門不能辭其咎、右衛鄭龍洙、身高善戰、較右衛洪聖恩似高一籌、中衛綫亦差强人意、前錄以金成玕最佳、兩　似少活動、故進攻時均着重於中路、故得手較難、港滬西聯隊均屬精銳之將、後衛派爾史溫、前衛巴爾圖考斯坦雷米狄、如鐵壁銅牆、把守堅固、然遇高麗隊之勇敢奮門、亦時有一籌莫展之嘆、</p>
<p>港滬隊先聲奪人</p>
<p>三時正裁判員倍能、鳴笛開戰、高麗隊迎日光開球、港滬隊截獲前攻、未四分鐘、霍威遠傳赫爾、盤至門前力射、托拔守候正着、躍起一項、球遂入網、首開紀錄、高麗隊見形勢不佳、急圖反攻、金成玕率領三軍、向敵門進逼、派爾不愼犯規、廿碼外罰任意球、幸賴史溫一頂、化險為夷、未幾、巴爾圖又犯規、金成玕舉足命射、惜斜出門外、又示得手、良機旣失、惡運驟臨、考斯坦並進、碧福一脚傳中、托拔輕輕一發、又吿中的、此後彼來我往、各無建樹、二比零結束上半時、</p>
<p>高麗隊一度中興</p>
<p>檸檬後、高麗隊力圖雪恥、形勢甚盛、五虎將在門前環攻、港滬隊門前盡屬高麗天下、時入混戰狀態、惜兩次射門、均為伯賽仲接住、死抱不放、高麗隊員猛衝無效、多人滾做一團、鳴笛開球、霍威單人獨馬、盤球深入、鄭龍洙阻擋不及、霍威於廿碼外遠射中的、造成三比零之局、高麗隊豈甘雌伏個個拼命、金成玕亦效霍威故技、單騎直入、伯賽仲連忙出迎、已趕不及、金成玕舉足一射、球遂入網、打破鴨蛋、全塲呼聲雷動、未二分鐘、又被左翼韓甲錫再射一球、聲勢大盛、前鋒五將、聯絡亦見轉佳、致使港滬隊無法抵抗、球不得越出中綫、此為高麗隊之極盛時代、惜射門慌亂、時成野球、遂使大好機會、輕易錯過、天不佑人、為之奈何、港滬隊難關旣過、再逞强能、考斯坦居中接應、福恩赫爾乘勢反攻、高麗隊後防空虛、托拔又形猖獗、在左角又射入一球、成四比二、高麗隊雖再圖恢復、然時不我與、裁判員長笛一聲、遂吿結束、雙方陣綫如下、</p>

<p>淞滬「一二八」抗戰，是中華民族解放鬥爭史的一頁，是全國民衆光榮而慘痛的紀念，誰都永遠地不會忘却！不過，「一二八」於今整整四年，國難的深重，愈發不像樣了。什麼「獨立」，「自治」的聲浪，愈唱愈高，一大塊一大塊的土地，都變作人家的領域，而我們只是忍耐，妥協，不抵抗，屈服，甚至不許喊一聲慘痛，只許你做隻馴服的羔羊，嗚呼！人間何世？</p>
<p>目前的中國，眞是到了最後的生死關頭！人家不僅是奪取我們的寶藏，簡直要滅亡我們的種族！在這時候，少數漢奸如殷汝耕等竟又以膝蓋對外；全國同胞應當首先聲討這些漢奸；因爲，我們如果日漸畏怯，陣綫凌亂，那麼入家一定氣燄萬文，慾壑沒有止境！</p>
<p>我們當然贊成和平未至絕境，决不輕於犧牲的話，但依今日的情勢，而謂和平有望，究至何時始言絕境？</p>
<p>筆者是國民一份子，愛國不敢後人，心所謂危，不憚費辭，務望全國同胞，一致醒悟！</p>
<h3 id="c187">白相考 <a href="#c187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>吳儂軟語，向爲人所艷稱。卽如一白相」一語是那麼短短的，故不論北老，廣老，縱別的蘇白學不像，也都會嚷着「白相，白相，」而這語遂通行各地。</p>
<p>按「白相」乃嬉游之意。望文生義：白，空也；相，瞧也，去聲。故白相卽「空瞧瞧」之謂；引申之，爲「空逛逛，」卽嬉游也。吳江志：白相作「孛相。」孛乃陰星，是孛相又有「瞧女人」的意思了。</p>
<p>在明朝，白相常作「白賞。」這有當時通俗小說可證。天然痴叟所著石點頭第十四卷「潘文子契合鴛鴦塚」一則故事內，有說：「還有一等老白賞，要勾搭去奉承好男風的大老官……」天然痴叟乃蘇人，故下筆不覺把方言「老白賞」三字用入句中了。老白賞者，卽「老白相」之謂。此可證者一。</p>
<p>至於要有怎樣資格，方能稱做一老白賞，」則明聖水衲艾居士豆棚閒話第十則「虎丘山賈淸客聯盟」一篇故事中說得很明白。居土云：「更有一班，却是浪裹浮萍，糞裹臭蛆相似，立便一堆，坐便一塊，不招而來，揮之不去，呌做老白賞。」所謂「老白賞」者如是。關於「白賞」二字的意義，據居士聽人猜說，謂：「這些人光著身，隨處挿脚，不管一人家山水園亭，骨董女客，不費一文，白白賞鑒的意思。」白相，明人作「白賞，」此可證者二。</p>
<p>如再推之於遠古，則毛詩陳風有「不績其麻，市也婆娑」之句；史記有「　珊勃翠上金隄」之文。「婆娑，」「　珊，」皆「白相」一聲之轉，所謂音似字異。據此，則「白相」二字淵源很古了。</p>

<p>— 茱英</p>
<p>每年到了年底，—是廢歷的年底，有一種應時的食品，呌做年糕。上海是寗波人的上海，所以過了國歷年，大街小巷裏的糕　舖，不用說了，都製售着寗波年糕。就是小南貨店，小麵館，油豆腐綫粉攤等等，總之是小規模的，吃食舖，也都紛紛地帶售着寗波年糕。此外，還有些本來空關着的沿街屋子裏，也有人暫時租借着，貼起了大紅的「眞正寗波年糕」，而一壁製，一壁發售着。還有，「　廣成衣舖」，「姑蘇老薦頭」，也會騰出半個門面來，租給投機家？開設臨時的寗波年糕舖。平日把粢飯油條，或是豆沙粽子當晨餐，或是當點心的，都紛紛地改吃白糖年糕團了。寗波人果然如此，非寗波人，也是如此，於是粢飯阿二，粽子老頭，只得每天仰起了頭歎氣，除了改行而暫時批販寗波年糕，是別無生路的了。偉大哉，在年終，在上海的寗波年糕。</p>
<p>寗波年糕，和蘇帮的桂花年糕，猪油年糕，是截然不同的。寗波年糕之中，是絕對沒有一屑糯米粉的。寗波年糕，是完全用粳米硬春成的。據說春年糕，比了打鐵還費力。的確，要把粳米顆兒，舂成比了糯米粉團更黏的寗波年糕自然非一舉手之勞，所能成功的。寗波年糕，是淡的，不像蘇州年糕那應的甜美。但是寗波年糕的所以能受大衆歡迎，也就在淡味上面。因爲寗波年糕是淡的，所以喜歡吃甜的，儘可加着糖，煎熬炒煮，而喜歡吃鹹的，儘可加入鷄絲肉片，隨心所欲。但是據說，在上海製的寗波年糕，是黏齒的，遠不如寗波來的眞正寗波年糕那麼的細緻滑膩。因此，在上海的寗波人，總是說：「在上海製的寗波年糕，是賣給上海人吃的呢。」</p>

<h3 id="c191">談談壓歲錢 <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— 明道</p>
<p>一般人很怕過廢曆年關，而兒童却是很快活的，因爲他們不但可以有玩耍，而且又有禮物可得，最普遍就是壓歲錢了。在除夕之前，俗例凡爲尊長的却有押歲盤分賜給他們的兒童，作爲廢曆新年的一種恩物，盤中自然滿盛着各色的糖菓，是兒童們心愛之物，到如今菓盤的式樣益發新頴美觀，面價値也增高了不少。按宋時除夕內司意思局進呈精巧消夜菓子盒，見宋夢梁錄，可見這個風俗在宋代已有了。低是壓歲盤之外必附帶壓歲錢，我現在就來談談壓歲錢。</p>
<p>壓歲錢和拜年錢意思差不多，是二而一的，不過拜年錢是給在兒童新歲拜年之時，而壓歲錢却是在除夕以前贈給兒童的。遠道之尊長每付郵寄，不但爲歲尾年頭贈送兒童，而也含有一種祝頌的意思，希望兒童歲歲平安，鎭壓不祥，用心甚善。記得作者在童年時所得壓歲錢，則爲一串串白銅的制錢，都是前淸乾隆嘉慶道光同治時鑄的，又白又厚，此種靑蛟在今日巳是罕見，每串爲一百文，贈變串者則爲二百文，取百歲和雙百歲的意思，當然是很好的口采。後來便改用銀幣了，大都是新的銀幣，兒童的衣袋中往往有鏗鏘的聲音可聽。現在硬幣停止使用，法幣當行，那麼壓歲錢也當然甩法幣了。有些人因爲市上的法幣都破爛污穢，减少美觀，所以預先都選藏着新的紙幣，以備贈送，也有用新的聯號，輔幣券，十張二十張贈送的。唯以前會見某姓以余鎊兩枚贈送兒童，可謂豪奢，而又有人贈送古幣，那是別開生面的壓歲錢了。</p>
<p>有許多兒童得了壓歲錢和賀年錢，往往放在自己衣袋裏自由使用。在那時候市上所有兒童玩具更是特別多，不論新式舊式的，都要化了錢去買，而且有許多東西玩過便沒有了，有的短時期內便損壞了，對於兒童耗費了金錢，也的去購食，又是閑着沒事做，一天到晚的吃東西了，若然吃得過多，或是吃了不衛生的食物，腸胃裏便要受着影響，甚至生病。道樣看來物有利，必有弊，其弊不在於壓歲錢的本身，而在於使用的方法，只要人們如何善用罷了。</p>
<p>壓歲錢當怎樣善用呢？作者以爲家長當對於他們自己的兒童，計核他們獲得了若干數，便想良好的方法，仍用在兒童身上，不失去它本來的意旨。若是家中兒童多的，那麼不妨將兒童的壓歲錢　集了，去購買幾種有益於兒童的書籍，給兒童們在寒假中可以閱書消遺，勝過其他一切不正當的遊玩，幷且每年積起來，將來可以成功一個兒童圖書庫了。樹木少的說話，也可以每年選購一種有用的東西，作為紀念品。除以上所說的，倘然把兒童所得的壓歲錢不放兒童用去，每年放在銀行裏儲蓄起來，那麼積少成多，將來也可補助兒童的學費，又可養成兒童儲蓄的習慣，豈不是一件美德嗎？至於有些家長勸導兒童將壓歲錢充作飛機捐，或是捐助災民，也是很好的事，能使兒童因此而增加愛國愛人之心。嘗見某翁曾將他兒孫所得的壓歲錢，買了許多有用之物去贈送給鄰近貧苦人家的兒童，這又是合着「幼吾幼以及人之幼」的用意了。總而言之，要用在正常的途徑上，那麼有利無弊。</p>

<h3 id="c193">台灣醫事觀感 <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— （錫康）</p>
<p>今年，在台灣開過一個台灣醫事會。那邊像杜聰明郭松根等都是知名的學者。這一决的南遊一方面想看看他們，一方還想乘便視察些台灣島的新設施。</p>
<p>吾曾想起，當台灣被割於日本的時候，李鴻章對伊籐博文說：要整頓台灣有兩伴麻煩的事情，一是疾病，一是生番。的確，因爲台灣之位於熱帶，所以多瘧疾，黑死病，霍亂，傷寒，天花等傳染病。但是日本的學者，正因爲台灣人的多病，就多給了他們研究的材料，多加了他們學術的進展，經過不斷的努力而得到顯著的成功，旅行家初到台北市，就看不到在那邊城市中有瘧疾傷寒等的痕跡：據衛生當局的報告。在全島中就是有一二個天花瘧病者，那是多從外面輸船上帶來的。</p>
<p>鴉片之在台灣，日人先辦專賣，收入却不少。雖然一面有登記，但還是很寬的。近來經國際聯盟幾决禁烟會議以後，日人的管理，也嚴格起來了。他們禁烟的計劃和戒烟的方法。還算完備。台北醫專的藥物敎授杜聰明博士。他對於這一方面的研究工作。眞是精動可佩。</p>
<p>在山脚的地方，因爲多水和田，就多發瘧疾。允其是慢性瘧疾，是常常會碰到的。他們有强迫檢查血液的條例，當局會給工人一天的工資，來實行强迫檢血工作。同時還有强迫治療，當局也要發給工資，而且可毫無費用地進醫院療治</p>
<p>因爲台灣的昆蟲很多，所以特別設置昆蟲研究室，研究有害於人體的昆蟲之病理，預防，治療等等。</p>
<p>又因爲一般醫師不願到鄉僻地方去行醫，所以當局就創設「公醫」。給以名義，濟以金錢，與以種種之便利。這樣一般醫師也就樂得而爲之。</p>
<p>關於台灣的醫事上還有一些要報告的，就是；在台灣的舊醫稱做醫生。當局准原有的醫生開業，但是不准新的醫生產生。而另一方面就努力於新醫—稱醫師—的製造。醫育制度上他們採取，兩級制，因爲要適應環境的需要，就無所顧忌的產生出新醫來。而且爲了要學問進步，他們會把不好的醫師，做第二次的訓練。綜計現有醫師和居民的比例是每二八〇〇個居民有，一個醫師。</p>
<p>吾想，吾們的同胞有四萬萬，那麼如其四〇〇〇人裏有一個醫師，也要產生十萬個醫師才够支配。倘使全國每年產生醫師數是一千。（據敎育部的統計，二十二年度醫科畢業生爲二二六人。）要一百年後才會達到我們的慾望。這豈不是成爲遠水不能救近火嗎？醫學敎育家。總要想想國家民族的前途。看看事實的需要。怎樣去通盤籌劃，應付這生存競爭下的非常時期啊。</p>
<h3 id="c194">「過度敏感」（Hypersen　sitiveness） <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— 月祺</p>
<p>—醫學故事之十六—</p>
<p>隨着病理學的發展，各種人體疾病的原因先後被人闡明。在這發見疾病原因的階段中，「過度敏感」要算是關於疾病原因的最近的發明了。「過度敏感」是什麼呢？這就是說：某種人體的部分對於某種物質的存在「過度敏感」，因而引起不利的反應，而同一物質對於其他人體却是無害的。</p>
<p>首先發表此種症象的是沙爾脫（Heany　ahydeSalter）一八六七年，沙爾脫出版一本叙述他自己的氣喘病的書籍。在這書上他說：「我的氣喘病的原因是接近普通的家貓。我記不出我最早發作此病是在什麼時候，但我相信大槪是從幼年時期就開始的。當我靠火坐着而貓躺在爐毯上的時候，我的氣喘就發作了；假如貓離我更近些，我的氣喘也就更利害些。與氣喘相伴的，是打噴嚏與流淚」。</p>
<p>其實，對於動物發射物過度敏感的人是很多的一。其中以對於馬毛特別敏一感的爲最多。他們大多數一接近馬就患氣喘。也有皮膚發疹的；也餓打噴嚏與流淚的。除馬以外，如犬·如牛·如鷄毛·如鴨毛·都會使某種人感到不舒服。</p>
<p>不但是動物，就是植物也會引起同樣的反應。最常見的是因植物花粉而起的，「枯草熱」（Hal-fever）。關於枯草熱的智識的科學的基礎，是勃拉克萊（Blacktey）所樹立的。一八七三年，一八八〇年，他先後出版兩本說明枯草熱的書。勃拉克萊自已常患枯草熱；他確信這病是草類的花粉所造成的。他搜集花粉，佇藏起來，，果然發作同樣的枯草熱。他又在夏季把膠盤暴露空中，從而發見在枯草熱季節中飄散於空氣中的是什麼植物的花粉。</p>
<p>某女郎患皮膚發疹頗劇，屢治不愈。後來，醫生勸她赴郊外泉地旅行一趟。到了那邊，她的皮膚病果然好了。過了一星期，她回到家裏，舊病又發作了。醫生頗覺奇怪，决定跑到她家中去察看。他發見她的住室的每一窗框上都放着連盆的櫻草。他把窗門推開，把櫻草盆拋出窗外。不久，這女郎的皮膚病居然全愈了。</p>
<p>對於兒童，某種食物是引起過度敏感反應的原因。有起氣喘的，有起皮膚發疹的，有起胸惡的，也有起痢疾的。對於某種食物的特殊厭惡，通常被誤視爲一種神經病。克林登寗博士說，在他的病人中，有一個是不能吃胡桃的。微微一口咬胡桃肉，他就發作劇烈的氣喘；吞入半枚，他就除氣喘外更起皮膚發疹。</p>
<p>關於「過度敏感」，還有一個有趣味的故事。某婦人常患氣喘，但不是像因花粉而起的枯草熱一般的氣喘。經長期的試察，她纔斷定她的氣喘是因揩擦金錶而起，因爲她每一擦錶，就起一回氣喘。原來她是用黃楊木屑擦錶的，而黃楊木屑會引起她的特殊的反應。她决定讓她的金錶污濁不擦，她的氣喘果然不復發作了。</p>

<h3 id="c196">麻疹的防範方法 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— 瘦秋</p>
<p>某一個時期裏，南京的麻疹症，突然的流行起來，小孩們患着麻疹的很多很多，其中固然大部份是被醫好，但是因而傷命的，也不乏人。事後，京市衛生事務所曾請醫藥學家研究防範的法子，已經得有相當的結果。昨天，特地通告全市的兒童家畏們注意。原文對於麻疹的症狀，防範；治療等項，都很淸楚的說明。現在把它寫在下面，使全國有兒童的家長們都加以注意。麻疹就是俗語說的疹子，也叫痧子，是一種最易傳染的病，特別容易侵犯小兒。一旦得了這個病，常因護理不週，併發其他病症，以致發生生命的危險。麻疹的原因，是一種濾過性細菌侵入人體所致。這種病菌多存在病人的鼻涕；淚；痰和口腔等分泌物裏。血液裏也有，人要接觸了，就能被傳染。</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>麻疹菌侵入人體以內，經過十幾天後，才顯疹子，這個時期，叫做潛伏期。本病初起，微似傷風感冒，繼之有怕冷；發熱；結膜發炎：（俗稱紅眼）眼分泌增多，咳嗽；噴嚏；流淚；舌被黃苔等現象。有的在第二天，或第三天細細檢視，兩顆裏面，對著血齒的地方，常常有灰白色小斑點。這叫做「考帕氏斑，」是早期診斷本病重要的一點。到了第四天，熱度繼續增高，在面部和鼻子兩旁，發生界限顯明，圍着毛孔暗紅色的小疹。由頭部而胸腹；而四肢；遍佈到全身。在這出疹的時期，新形勢最為沉重。病後容易並發其他病症，如肺炎，氣管支炎，腎臟炎，淋巴腺腫；中耳炎，腸炎以及口類壞死；（水癌，俗稱走馬疳）病人常因之而致危險。如護理得法，疹子發出，則經過三四日後，熱度就很快的低隆，疹子也漸漸消滅而痊愈。傳染方法，麻疹都是直接接觸傳染的。接觸病人的鼻，或口腔分泌物後，就能傳染，而發生本病，麻疹病人通常在潛伏期內，直至疹後，仍有分泌物時，均能傳染他人。茲將麻疹防範方法，及護理方法列後：</p>
<p>麻疹防範的方法是：　麻疹多侵犯小孩，三歲以下的小孩，死亡率最高較之三歲以上的，約高四十倍以上。所以三歲以下的小兒，務宜設法避免，勿使感染本病。　家裏如有孩子疑發生麻疹，應當和其他孩子隔離。勿使回室居住，勿使互相接觸，卽護理麻疹的家人，也切勿與其他健康孩子接觸，以免傳染。　鄰居有孩子發生麻疹，一家的人，切勿與之接近。　凡曾接觸過病人的人，宜特別注意。如有鼻塞發熱等象，宜速延醫檢查，以期早期隔離治療。　病人住過的房屋，宜將四窗打開，使空氣日光充足。　學校內如有麻疹發生，則家屬應令兒童暫行停學十四日，以免傳染。　注射麻疹恢復期血淸，或母親血液，可以暫時避免麻疹。恢復期血淸甚不易得母親血液，則無論何時何地，俱可辦到。術極簡易，普通醫師都可施行。法在母親靜脈內，抽出血液五公攝，立卽注射於小孩之臀部肌肉內，注射後並無反應。注射要點有三：（甲）母親血液之注射，最好於接觸後之最初五天內行之，則可防止該症。過五天之後，不能絕對防止該症發生。但仍可使新形勢减輕，如接觸者已呈病狀，卽不能生效力，亦不能使病狀减輕。故自己小孩，已與患麻疹的接觸或家中有一孩發生麻疹，而其他小孩尚未顯有病狀時，當立卽施行此種注射，盼能防免該症發生，卽不能防免，亦可使新形勢减輕。（乙）母親血液之注射，宜施於三歲以下之小孩，三歲以上之小孩，可不必施行。蓋三歲以上，迄成年時代止，麻疹死亡率最低，此後復較高，故麻疹最好於此時內得之，危險旣較少，且可終身免疫。（丙）施行母親血液注射，免疫時間，不過數星期，所以注射後，仍須與患者隔離。　家中有患麻疹者，應卽電吿衛生事務所，以便派員指示防範及護理示，或到各分所施行母親血液注射。至於護理方法：　病人室內溫暖，濕潤；且須令空氣新鮮。宜將離病人較遠之窗開放。室中溫度，最好在華氏表七十度上下。　病人之軀斡，宜保持溫暖，但口鼻宜露置於新鮮空氣中，以防並發之肺炎，及氣管支炎。　病人之眼畏光，宜戴眼罩，或使室內光線稍為黑暗，兩眼可用硼酸洗滌。　病令口腔，宜特別注意淸潔，以防並發症，亦可用硼酸水漱口。　病人飲食，以流動食物為佳，以防腸炎。並須多飲開水。　病人咳嗽氣喘，宜速延醫診治。　耳病宜報吿醫師，以防並發之中耳炎，　麻疹愈後應有充分休養二星期，注意預防傷風，及其他傳染病，尤宜注意並發肺癆。如再有發熱，應速卽延醫診治。</p>

<p>— 周夢白</p>
<p>（十二）除蟲菊Chrysanthenun　Ｃinerasiifoliun，Bocc．Insektenblune（德）Insectflower（英）</p>
<p>（植物）為墺國Dalnatia　原產。各地均可栽培，多年生草也。莖瘠長，高約30—60公分。莖葉密生絹毛。葉有長柄，213回羽狀全裂，裂片作綫形，略帶粉白色。初夏，抽出花莖，花莖分歧，開多數頭狀。頭狀花徑長一公分內外，舌狀花為白色。</p>
<p>（栽培法）九月下旬，播種於苗床，翌年四月，移植本圃。且本每多利用麥跡，不另行整地及其他手續，於麥株旁穿一穴，栽植一二株，其間相距約為一尺。我國之溫州及常州近年產量亦多肥料以人糞及人造肥料為主。播種後翌年年初開花。當頭狀花周圍之舌狀花憶開放而管狀花大部分未開之時，為收獲適當之期。花採下，於陽下曝乾之。每畝可收乾花百餘斤。</p>
<p>莖葉曝乾研末，可作蚊香，亦相當需要。</p>
<p>（生藥）除蟲菊花Flos　Pyrethri　乃採集除蟲菊之狀頭花曝乾而成。本品有直徑約一公分內外之花床，花床約為四十餘個苞葉而成，圍繞總苞，內部有一列舌狀花，更內則有管狀花。不附花梗者為上品。舌狀花約15—20個，乾燥品皺縮屈曲，白中略帶黃色，長約一公分，闊約2—4公厘。管狀花上端五裂，呈微黃色，筒狀部為汚白色，長2.5公厘，徑0.7公厘。本品有特異之芳香。</p>
<p>本品粉末，在顯微鏡下檢視，有無數花粉及花部組織破片。花粉為球形，作黃褐色，直徑28—40u，有無數突起。以花粉之多寡，為除蟲菊粉末良否之標準，蓋有無攙和物及採花時期適當與否而花粉有多寡之分也。藤田氏謂粉末一公絲中，花粉數若非1300以上者，不能稱為良品。市塲中之優良品，每有含花粉數5000以上者也。組織破片中最顯明者，為苞葉之丁字形毛茸·上皮·舌狀花冠·花粉及纖維等。</p>
<p>（成分）除蟲菊中有效成分，稱Pyetbrin　I（C21H30O3）及Pyretbrin　II（C22H30O5），為液狀物質，其中含量，兩者合約0.3％。若加水分解，卽消失殺蟲效力。</p>
<p>其他尚含有結晶性特質Pyretbrol（C11H30O）及少量精油，此等成分，無殺蟲效力。</p>
<p>（藥理）本植物有效成分，屬於一種神經筋肉毒。施於溫血動物，能惹起强烈之癲癇痙攣，且因血管運動神經中樞之亢奮，因而發生顯著之血壓上升，因呼吸中樞之亢奮，使呼吸機能增進。體重一公斤之家兔，以此種成分於靜脈內注射二公絲，卽引起劇烈之中毒現象，數分鐘後卽能復原。倘內服一公分，則不發生何等現象。</p>
<p>（用途）除蟲菊花之粉末，每作殺蟲粉及製造蚊香之用。蚊香通常以除蟲菊花及莖葉之粉末，混和於椨粉（椨皮Cortex　Machili粉末）中，復加綠色染料（俗名靑竹），調以溫水，使凝固如麺團，入蚊香壓榨器中壓榨，成細綫狀之物，在適當之長度下切斷而乾燥之卽成。其狀為渦卷形及以竹絲作心製成如棒香者。</p>
<p>又多量用作農用殺蟲劑。但通常作除蟲菊石鹸乳劑用。其製法以除蟲菊花2雨，先搗碎，浸以石油一升，經二晝夜後，以濾過之石鹸粉末1.2—1.5兩及水5合而製成乳劑。使用時，加水不加水均可，但加水以2—5倍之量為度。（未完）</p>

<p>— 林鑑賢</p>
<p>第三節　齒槽膿漏症</p>
<p>（第九二問）第二種的症候怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）此種病症較深。牙肉不如第一種之紅腫，往往反覺白貧血。牙根膜從牙頭部起，破壞甚速。靠近牙頭之齒槽骨（卽牙床骨），漸漸退縮。牙肉亦隨之退縮，漸與牙齒分離，分離處就做成一囊袋，貯積膿液，時常流出。囊袋內往往有硬質齒石，附着牙齒。牙齒動搖，終至脫落。患者口腔甚臭，囊袋內，常現阿米巴寄生蟲。</p>
<p>（第九三問）第三種的症候怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）此種齒槽膿漏症，多為全身疾病所引起。牠的症候也不一致。如為花柳病或肺癆病所引起的。則新形勢進行極快，齒槽骨急速破壞，膿汁常流，牙齒動搖，醫治費時。如為糖尿病所引起的，則牙肉浮腫，牙根膜發炎，感覺酸痛。膿汁或有或無。</p>
<p>（第九四問）齒槽膿漏症所產生的膿汁，有什麽害處？</p>
<p>（答）這種膿汁的害處，和上節所述牙根膜炎膿汁的害處一樣。不過膿汁較多，為害較烈些。所以患齒槽膿漏症的人，若不早治，延長時日，大都健康减退，面黃神疲。</p>
<p>（第九五問）若患部牙齒脫落或抜云後，則該處膿汁停止，病狀消失。但隣近牙齒病勢依舊進行。所以患這病的人，往往弄到滿口牙齒都脫光為止，或扳抜光為止。全口牙齒抜除，也是防止膿汁危險一着。</p>

<p>第六節　專門性的刺激治療—鐵勃固靈</p>
<p>鐵勃固靈之長期療治，對於肺結核症一般症象，像溫度增高，頭痛·咳嗽·虛弱。</p>
<p>食態不佳，盜汗，等種種；大致都有良好之功效的。但他在治療方面，並非每一種本病都可採用無疑的，有幾種型式是很不相宜的。尋常新鮮的侵潤，以及侵潤面積過廣者，照例是受不了過度刺激的，所以他的應用，是不大相宜的；帶有空洞和發高熱者，是决對不可使用，有咳血之傾向者，也是一樣的。就是輕度的本症，也用不着多此一舉的！他所適應的，是溫度並不現增高或不甚高的慢性型式；尋常在攝氏三十八度以下，大槪用不着十分顧慮的。對於小孩方面，也以慢性型式為宜。如果就病體的性質來說，則增生性大半是適應的，而滲出性則不宜輕易嘗試。關於鐵勃固靈對病者之感應，是人人不同的；故劑量之輕重增减，須全憑醫者獨具隻眼，斟酌行事；决不是拘泥成法，蕭夫曹隨的。</p>
<p>關於鐵勃固靈之製劑，習見才也有好幾種，但其中並沒有多大分別。最習見的還是讀給考后之老鐵勃固靈；這是取純粹結核菌甘油肉汁培養基，經過六至八星期之蒸濾，取其菌體之互素而成的。此外，還有好幾種鐵勃固靈類似製劑，也可以說是鐵勃固靈改良智劑，但迄今臨床方面，還沒有多大顯著成績，本文也不一一旁徵博引了！</p>
<p>關於鐵勃固靈之詳細用法，目前已有好多專書了，决不是本編所可盡的，况且本編並不是供給醫者們閱讀的，更用不着過分瑣碎。但作者還有幾句話要貢獻給讀者們的。就是：鐵勃固靈的行使，决不是很簡單的方法，其間劑量之分配，稍一忽略，眞所謂差之毫釐，失之千里的。如果病者行使此種治療，對於醫者所關囑之種種，須有深刻之了解及信仰。其間像注射前後之檢查體溫，每日之固定檢查體溫，注射後須若干埋單之安靜休養，等種種；都是非常煩瑣，為一般患者所不願聞，但患者又决對不能疎忽的。假使發生反應了，患者除决對安靜休養外，更用不着恐懼或妄加揣測，須知此種情形，並非完全不可能的。再則，他的整個治療期是很長久的，患者又須有充分之忍耐心，萬不可因偶有出入，而加以懷疑的。凡此種種，如果不深切了解，在醫者方面，不過覺得多此一舉，或且係前菌盡棄，其損失還少；但在患者一方，其身體及金錢上之損失，眞不可同日而請了！希望讀者們加以留意！</p>

<h3 id="c210">獅和羊 <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— 子南</p>
<p>我們的國粹家們時常把獅子來譬喻爲自己，獅爲萬獸之王，我們這個老大中華，也是「地大物博，有五千餘年文化」之大國。因之，隱隱然以獅子來譬喻中國，是有萬邦來朝的潛意識的存在的。</p>
<p>不過近百年來的中國歷史，實在使國粹家們痛心得很，不僅衆獸臣服的現象絲毫沒有，就是獅子的本身吧，也時常今天給人咬去一條尾巴，明天咬掉一條腿的在漸漸地被瓜分；雖然這現象在慣會意淫的國粹家們還聊自解嘲的解釋爲「睡獅」。可是「睡獅」而一睡至於被人咬掉尾巴咬掉腿還不醒過來，那麼卽使是一息尚存，和「死獅」大槪也相差不遠了。</p>
<p>和死要面子的國粹家們恰巧相反的，是有些失敗主義者，機會主義者們把中國看爲羔羊。看爲羔羊不足，還把中國看爲迷途的羔羊，以爲彷徨歧途，不知所措，而所處的環境，又是前有荊棘，後有豺狼。</p>
<p>因之，這些沒出息的傢伙深深地嘆息起來，以爲「中國不亡，是無天理」。中國眞非果亡不可嗎？卽使是羔羊，卽使是迷途的羔羊。</p>
<p>小時候聽到過一個故事：說是有一羣羊在廣大的草原上優遊自在，遠遠地有一隻狼來了，牧羊者見了狼，不等到狼走近，早已嚇得魂飛魄散，一溜烟的不知溜到什麼地方去。賸下的便祗有這一羣以馴順出名的羊。</p>
<p>可是狼來了之後，牠對這一羣羊可不敢有什麼舉動，因爲牠知道羊雖然是以馴順出了名的，然而終究它還有二隻角，並且，羊是有一羣，在生命感到危急的時候，雖然以馴順出名的羊，也難保不自衛一下，因之，牠祇能靜以待變，等羊羣自己分化的時候，牠乘機來各個擊破。</p>
<p>在受到相當損失以後的羊羣，牠們明白了各自爲戰的必然失敗，而等待牧羊者來驅走貪得無已的狼也是一個可笑的幻夢，因之牠們祇有更親切的聯合在一起，並且知道，如果不驅走狼，那麼牠們的生命是朝不保夕的，因爲隨便什麼時候，狠都可以隨心所欲的衝到牠們的隊伍中來擇肥而噬的。</p>
<p>在在在有生命之慮的威脅下和屢决由犧牲得來的經騐，牠們澈底覺悟到不是沒有羊羣便是驅走狼，這兩者之問是絕無妥恊的可能，因之便準備犧牲去換得自由，而向狼漸漸地逼近，……</p>
<p>這故事的結果如何？到現在我已經記不起來了。雖然說起來，似乎還很新鮮似的。</p>
<p>寫到這兒，我斗然記起今天就是一二八四週年了，在這偉大的紀念日到臨</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>前，照例似乎應該寫些應時文章。然而我却在這裏好整以暇的在說着故事。</p>
<p>說說故事和聽聽故事，於事實究有何補？我實在回答不出來。不過這篇短文旣已寫成如此，也就懶得重寫，將就一下算了吧。</p>
<p>至於「羊」的故事後文究竟如何？那個且等我想得起來時再告訴諸位。不過我想，這羣羊如果眞的團結一起而又不怕犧牲，那麼狼是不難戰退的，以後的出路，以羣策羣力的來幹，也大槪不致於永遠迷途下去，雖然牧羊者早已溜走，馴順的羊們似乎失了統率者，然而，羣衆也就是最好的統率者啊。</p>

<p>— 許傑</p>
<p>「晚上謝年，早一點回來！」</p>
<p>早上爸爸上公司去，媽這樣對他說。這是年常的舊例，媽把謝年是作爲唯一大事的；寗可自家餓肚皮，祖宗菩薩是木能得罪的，爸爸這幾年來生意順手，都是靠了祖宗菩薩保佑，所以媽不會忘了初一，十五，逢時過節的日子。謝年她更是謹愼從事，幾天前就忙着打掃屋子，玻璃窗揩得亮亮的，把燭台封了紅紙，三星官居中掛了起來，水菜菜餚都要討個吉利的名字，因爲謝年是卜明年一歲的凶吉；譬如賭博，寗可自家餓肚皮，是下的本注，而一年的利益是收之無窮的。</p>
<p>他們有一個十二歲的兒子，自從校里放了假，兒子就瞧着日歷等候這天到來。這一天是他最自由的一天，媽因爲要討吉利，無論他做錯什麼事，總是閉上眼睛，塞了耳朶忙着謝年的事，到了實在看不過云的時候，授幾個錢給兒子請他到弄里云玩。</p>
<p>她是從櫉房到客堂，客堂到櫉房的忙着，每一件瑣細的事，如掛三星官，揩桌子，都是自己親自動手的，她顯得那樣虔誠，到了叩頭的時候，嘴里喃喃地祈禱着：祇禱丈夫生意順手，自己手輕脚健，兒子長大成人。她所希望的，錄每個婦人一樣。</p>
<p>從早上忙到晚，客堂里電燈燃亮了，三星官拉開了笑臉，捧着元寶，雪亮的燭台，整齊的菓盆都排列在桌上，但是一件最緊要的事—燃香燭，這是每年由丈夫動手的，她相信婦人的手是不潔的，要冲犯祖宗菩薩的。於是她喘過一口氣，到弄口去張望，街上是嘈雜的，烟兌店里的元寶都掛在大門外面，孩子們擠在人羣中丟火藥砲，她拉着兒子問他看見爸沒有。兒子張大了眼珠，搖搖頭。黃包車接連地在弄口停下，每個人都挾了大包小包的，但是沒有她的丈夫，應該是公司里散寫字問的時候了。</p>
<p>回到客堂里，她頹然坐下，她戚到有點疲倦，但是眼前雪亮的一片，一切象徵着發財的預兆。她心里譴責她的丈夫，一年一次的謝年，不肯早一點回家，自己忙了這許多天，手脚都軟了，不是希望合家平安發財嗎？這樣想着時她又後悔了，或許公司里今年生意特別好，這幾天結賬時候就忙不過來了，丈夫一年忙到頭，，也實在太辛苦了。她想打個電話到公司去罷，兒子却跳躍着進來了，吵着吃年夜飯。她沒有理會她兒子，打電話到公司去，公司回話已走了，她就吩咐兒子到弄口去等爸爸，自己跑進櫉房去了。</p>
<p>但是丈失還是沒有回來，隣舍人家的爆竹在四面響了起來，時候已不早了，她想不透丈夫到底到什麼地方去的，沒奈何她督着兒子燃了香燭，母子倆個等到香燭點盡不見丈夫的影踪。吃年夜飯是要合家團聚的，他們等着，等着…</p>
<p>不知什麼時候爆竹又饗了起來，聲音是異樣地驚人，彷彿每一響都打中人們的心坎一樣，媽驚異着今天什麼事都發生變卦的時候，弄里有人高聲喊着閘北開火的消息，這是一個晴天的霹靂，兒子哭了，他肚子餓，媽也哭了，丈夫還沒有回來…</p>
<p>一年，二年…四年，兒子已是十六歲了！</p>
<h3 id="c212">回家 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— 耶戈</p>
<p>山頭城的城樓漸漸地在山途的塵霧里縮小，隱沒了。</p>
<p>山路上底兩旁滿佈着的竹叢，悄悄的在低語着。昨晚降了陣大雪，現在，風雖略靜點，但那刺骨的寒氣，却比往前更深。慶元老頭咯嘟着嘴告訴我說：路旁的小河溝都已給氷凍對固住了，驢子跑的氣乏，口乾，就連一點點兄闊喉的也沒有。末後他又嘆息也似的接下道：「這樣的冷法，三十年來沒有的啊」！</p>
<p>對于慶元老頭，我是去年運洋貨到山頭城來，在鷄公庵才認識的。那時他還是一個爽直而且快活的中年男子，每當盛夏時節，他便赤起上身頭半，上高緾着那叢花白辮子，坐在凉風的蓬車上，高揚着鞭，大聲的吆喝着。當驢子疊起前蹄咯嗒的在走着的時候，他便謎般的微閉住眼睛，左手放在大腿上輕輕的彈着，嘴里則嗚嗚咽咽的哼着「山嶺路崎……」，直到驢子也受了他底推眠，放低了呆伐，而至于悄悄的站住，呆住眼，搖着耳朵時，他才吃驚地睜開眼來，向四周探望着。在這樣的塲合里，他往往會誤會自己底驢子是受了什麼阻力而不得前進；但當他看見了四周仍是這麼疲嫩而寂寞的，於是，鞭兒又燥暴地響了，驢兒也絕望的跨開步，慢慢的走了。</p>
<p>進了城，交淸貨色，老慶元趕着驢子去上料，托人家看住，自己拍拍身上的灰塵，便也上呌大觀園的那家小飯店去，呌了五十文白乾，一角子飯菜，吃了，出得飯店，在芳珍的什貨攤上買根香烟捲，啣在嘴里抽着，又在街上閉蕩着。末了，看看日頭，知道已快過正中；於是便上幾個熟悉的店家去，探聽有沒有什麼貨色好載上大城去。</p>
<p>從那時到現在相隔恐怕也還不到一年，他却老邁多了，頭上頂着的那叢花白辮子，也差不多快禿光，牙齒也掉了好些個，再也不會那麼興冲冲的尖起喉嚨來那麼一套「山嶺路崎」了。他是老了，時間無情地剝削去了他底一切。</p>
<p>前好幾天，這輛久沒露面的老驢車，又在這山城的小街上出現，是載着一個矮小的老頭，据說是全興洋號的賬房先生下鄕來討賬的。這位賬房先生沒有當天回去，老驢車找不到主顧也沒回去，寄在一家小客棧里。日子住的久了，眼看是快到了大年夜，慶元老頭着了急，便到處去探問兜客，結果是泰元隆小老板，臭破豆腐店夥計戇金和我都答應了。</p>
<p>驢車拖上金鷄嶺，沿着斜坡直下。，這山坡原是佈滿松林的，幾個月前官兵跟土匪打了一塲仗，便被燒的精光了。從大城到山頭城這一百五十里的矩離中，這山坡是被指爲危險地帶的，從前，在那靑翠的古松枝上，便常有赤裸裸的屍體或腐爛的死人頭掛着，而一些路過的客商婦女也常會在這兒不知不覺的掉失得無影無踪的。老慶元便常用慨嘆的聲調，來說明他怎樣的看見有若干趕路的貨商被整串的栓着去，有若干人怎樣的被殺死，末了他又說：</p>
<p>「又有一回，我從山頭城趕着車要回大城去，那時天氣還早，這兒路過的行人一個也沒有，可是却還能借着微弱的月光看淸了路徑。在一叢刺崗下，我們便發現了一堆血跡，當時我們一起是三個人，大家便商量着要怎樣去發現這個奇跡。有一個溫州長工，自願担當看守行李和驢車的職務；於是，我們兩個便都下車，跟着血跡尋去。這松林原本是沒人走動的，所以路途屆屆曲曲的很是難走，又兼是天氣陰暗，但我們將于在一堆厚叢下找到了。</p>
<p>「你們大家以謂找到的是些什麼！說來會呌人吃驚的！原來就是一個無首的屍身。模一模還有點兒熱，但手足却都被截去，只光禿禿的一團。後來我們進得城去，才知道這個被害的屍身，原就是一個偵探。嗣後不久，又聽說這兒信兵跟土匪打着仗，而這些靑松林也就這樣被砲火燬的精光了」。</p>
<p>這是驢車已趕下山坡，而轉入一條石蛋路去了，老慶元止住了話，用鞭子遠遠的指着一座村子道：「烏留鎭就到了」！我們抬起頭來望車篷外望出去，看看日頭己快沉西了。</p>

<p>在某時倫敦公安局審判庭上。曾發生了一件動人聽聞的事情，有一個衣飾襤褸面貌肅雅的人。來庭求敎。</p>
<p>「局長，我可以問你一個問題嗎」；</p>
<p>「祇要我能回答得來。」</p>
<p>「就祇這一句話：我還能活着麼」？</p>
<p>「滾出去！」</p>
<p>「局長，這是我十分眞心的話呀。這一個問題關係我的生命，所以我要知道。我是一個造機器的工人。」</p>
<p>「你沒有神經病麼？」</p>
<p>「局長，我一點兒也不有神經病」。</p>
<p>「那麼，你到這裏問這樣的一個問題，是什麼用意？」</p>
<p>「局長，我失業了！」</p>
<p>「這與那問題有什麼柑干？」</p>
<p>「局長，事實如此。我已經失業兩月，並不是因爲我自己有什麼過犯。局長自然也聽得說了，像我這樣的人，有幾十萬呢。」</p>
<p>「噢，是的，你往下講。」</p>
<p>「局長，我叉不在什麼工會。局長是曉得的，我們這一行。就沒有一個工會。」</p>
<p>「不錯，不錯。」</p>
<p>「局長，從三個禮拜以前，我就到束手無策的末路了。我竭力的找工作，終是沒有成功。」</p>
<p>「你沒到你們地方上的賬濟會去麼？」</p>
<p>「局長，我去過了，但是早都人滿了。」</p>
<p>「你沒去求那敎區的當局麼？」</p>
<p>「去來着，局長，還求過牧師的呢？仍是無結果啊！」</p>
<p>「你沒有什麼親戚朋友帮你的忙麼？」</p>
<p>「局長，有一半也知我的情形一樣。那一半也被我累窮了。」</p>
<p>「你眞個……？」</p>
<p>「而且連把他們能够省下來的，都給我挪用光了。」</p>
<p>「你有太太和小孩麼？」</p>
<p>「局長，沒有。這也與我不利。述累得我到處都赶不上步兒。」</p>
<p>「不錯，我明白了。不過你着濟貧法你很可以……」、</p>
<p>「局長，我也曾去過兩個地方。但是前天夜上因爲住不下了我們好幾十都給赶出來了。局長，我就缺少吃的。我還有權利作工麼？」</p>
<p>「祇要遵着濟貧法……」</p>

Dai Chuanxian chaired the meeting and reported, briefly stating that when the Premier first created the Central Committee, he took restoring the Chinese nation as the responsibility of the Party, and the declaration clearly indicated that all resolutions of previous representative conferences followed this spirit. We must not forget the Premier's teachings and principles today, we must be of one mind and one virtue, be faithful and loyal, and eliminate the habits of following old ways, muddling along, perfunctoriness, and embellishment, in order to achieve the goals of national construction and national salvation.

The meeting adjourned after the speech at around 11:00 a.m. (27th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing: Chairman Lin reported at the National Government Memorial Week on the morning of the 27th, first explaining the Premier's teachings in detail, "Species take competition as a principle, mankind takes mutual assistance as a principle, society and the nation are the embodiment of mutual assistance, and morality and righteousness are the use of mutual assistance," saying that the reason why mankind is different from species is that one is organized and the other is rational. Darwin's theory of "survival of the fittest" has been studied by later philosophers, and it is now known that his views are incorrect. The Premier once said, "Darwin applies the principle of species to the evolution of mankind, not knowing that mankind has already moved towards the principle of mutual assistance." However, the method of mutual assistance is inseparable in one country and one nation, but for other countries and other nations, those who believe in power also feel that it is unnecessary. Therefore, the European War was exhausted and miserable, and the word "power" was the cause of the disaster. It was decided that after the end of the European War, the great powers knew that the losses of war were too great, so there were various treaties of the Washington Conference and the Nine-Power Treaty, intending to maintain world peace based on the principle of international mutual assistance. In 1920, the League of Nations was established, and its meaning was to strive to protect the peace and security of all countries, to develop all material and civilized cooperation between countries, and to effectively sanction acts of aggression in accordance with the alliance. The spirit of the League of Nations lies in this point. Furthermore, it was decided that the evolution of mankind, the relationship between people and people, and between countries and countries, is becoming increasingly close. Therefore, modern politicians should broaden their horizons with regard to international affairs and seek collective security based on the principle of mutual assistance. With regard to domestic affairs, they should trust each other, understand each other, and unite sincerely to plan for self-improvement and survival. This is what our party comrades and government colleagues should strive to do. Finally, it was stated that we should take these words of the Premier as the basis, and we should strive for progress through self-improvement. We must also know that we have the ability to obtain the mutual assistance of others and to help others. We hope that everyone will work hard to promote it. (27th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e16">Will and Preparation <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>— Zi</p>
<p>When a Japanese person who traveled to China after the Sino-French peace treaty in 1885 feared that China would actively seek strength and Japan would not be able to defeat it in three years, Ito Hirobumi said, "China is not to be feared. After the French affairs are settled, it seems to be energetic and promising. After a year or two, it will once again follow the old ways and fall asleep." Afterwards, Ito's words were fulfilled, and many Japanese observers of China agreed with it. However, this cannot be used to discuss the hearts of the Chinese people after the January 28 Incident. Since the January 28th heroic resistance in the 21st year of the Republic, there have been constant facts and lessons that make people shudder and are awe-inspiring. There is a legacy of martyrs' heroic demeanor that can inspire the stubborn and establish the cowardly. Today's Chinese citizens are mostly awake and thoroughly understand and possess the correct will to defend the country. The reason why they have not been able to help the national crisis is due to the lack of preparation.</p>
<p>The reporter still remembers that in the open letter to the nation at the memorial service for the martyrs of the Songhu Anti-Japanese War, it was said, "In this decisive battle, we deeply feel the lack of new-style war equipment and the magnitude of the sacrifice. We believe that modern warfare is increasingly mechanized, and brave hand-to-hand combat is a thing of the past. The mechanization of war preparation is the result of the industrialization of modern society." The martyrs of the Anti-Japanese War did not feel discouraged by the lack of new-style war equipment, and they fought bravely and did not care about the great sacrifices. It is truly inspiring every time we recall their spirit. We know that if we want to solve the national crisis, we must continue the spirit of sacrifice of the martyrs. However, in order to have something to rely on for modern mechanized national defense, it is the responsibility of the people of the whole country to do their best to promote the industrialization of society. This is also what our Chinese people should recognize under the conditions that there is still time for preparation.</p>
<p>The martyrs of the January 28 Incident had heroic sacrifices to express their will to defend the country, which greatly inspired our national spirit. However, due to the lack of supply of mechanized war equipment by the state and society, it was difficult to reverse the decline of that year. Those who commemorate the martyrs today should continue their will to defend the country and devote themselves to practical preparatory work. Even if they cannot shed blood for the country, they should also sweat for the country. Accumulating the efforts of the people of the whole country over time should be effective. If the martyrs knew, they would be slightly comforted.</p>
<p>The so-called preparatory work refers to promoting the industrialization of society, as mentioned above. Modern industry relies on modern science, and other industries such as agriculture and commerce are also closely related. Therefore, today's Chinese people, if they do not become lazy, can devote themselves to the preparatory work of saving the country in various ways. The incompetent reporter is facing this painful memorial day and is ashamed that he has nothing to comfort the souls of the martyrs. He can only briefly describe one or two of what he sees to the Chinese people who are determined to defend the country.</p>
<h3 id="e17">All Staff of the General Staff Swear in Yesterday; Feng Yuxiang Supervises the Oath and Delivers Instructions <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing: The Chief of General Staff, Director-Generals of the Two Bureaus, and all directors of departments, section chiefs, and officers above the rank of lieutenant took an oath of office at the National Government Memorial Week at 27:00 a.m. After Chairman Gan Qian delivered instructions, Supervisor Feng Yuxiang delivered instructions, followed by Yang Jie giving a reply and the ceremony was completed. The original text of Feng's instructions is as follows: In the past, Zigong asked about governance, and Confucius said, "Sufficient food, sufficient soldiers, and the people will trust them." Since ancient times, there have been popular instructions by predecessors on the way to establish a country. Sufficient food means transporting food and relief, and filling the granaries. Sufficient soldiers means conscripting and training, and hiding soldiers among the farmers. The people's trust includes a wide range and is the most important. This requires reforming politics and basing it on the people, so that trust can be established among the people. Therefore, the sages earnestly said that those who have been known for military affairs in our country since ancient times have been the disciplined army of Duke Huan of Qi and Duke Wen of Jin, and the benevolent and righteous army of Tang and Wu. There were no benevolent and righteous armies, because Tang and Wu comforted the people and punished crimes. The disciplined army was neat and solemn. Comforting the people and punishing crimes can indeed be called a benevolent and righteous army, but safeguarding the security of the country, seeking the survival of the nation, preventing the invasion of other countries, and striving to recover lost territory are even more so than comforting the people and punishing crimes. Today, our country is oppressed by powerful neighbors, day by day. You are all deeply aware of this and there is no need to elaborate. Therefore, the entire military preparation of our country from now on should be disciplined, benevolent, and righteous. As for planning and winning, it should be something that all of you who participate in the deliberations should pay attention to. Comrades, you have been in the army for many years, and you have established a foundation for your academic qualifications, merits, and achievements. I hope that you will continue to exert your intelligence to promote it. (27th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e27">Central Commemorative Week: Vice Chairman Chiang's Original Speech - The Significance of Civil Servant Organization and Training - Government Financial and Economic Construction Guidelines <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing. On the 27th, Vice Chairman Chiang delivered a speech at the Central Commemorative Week on the significance of training civil servants and the government's financial and economic construction guidelines and programs as follows: The significance and importance of civil servant organization and training; The true meaning of revolution lies in sacrificing the individual to serve society and the nation; The government is now determined to implement financial plans and realize economic policies; "Labor" and "Integrity" are fundamental requirements for revolutionary nation-building. The original speech is as follows: Chairman, fellow comrades, after listening to the Chairman's report just now, I have many thoughts. Due to time constraints, I can only briefly mention a few points. The government now has a plan to train all civil servants in the capital. This is a common practice in modern countries, but it is only beginning in China. In foreign countries, whether in peacetime or wartime, all citizens, especially all civil servants, have accurate statistics, strict organization, and mobilization training. Only in this way can it be considered a modern nation. We now want to organize and train all citizens, but due to various shortcomings, it is naturally not easy to achieve in the short term. Therefore, we want to start with the capital first. We must first start with the general civil servants who have the knowledge and responsibility to educate the people and govern the country, especially those in the capital. Once civil servants are well-organized and trained, the general public will have a model to follow. Then, we can take civil servants as the foundation, extend it, and organize and train all citizens, thereby maximizing political effectiveness and increasing the country's overall strength. Our so-called civil servants broadly encompass all personnel from various sectors, including the Party, government, military, academia, and police. In the Party, from the Central Committee members to all staff; in the government, from the heads of agencies to all subordinates; in the military, including officers and soldiers of all military organs and units; in academia, including all faculty, staff, and students of all schools; in the police, including all military police officers. We need to have accurate statistics, effective organization, and training for all Party, government, military, academic, and police personnel in the capital. As the saying goes, "Prepare for war in peacetime, and remain calm in wartime." This means that we must be as energetic and hardworking in peacetime as in wartime, preparing everything. Then, in wartime, we can be calm and composed, and not change our routine, so as to achieve the greatest victory with the least sacrifice. That is the so-called "sweat more in peacetime, bleed less in wartime." A country that cannot achieve these two phrases cannot be considered a modern nation. Therefore, the most important thing is the organization and training of all citizens, especially the general civil servants who educate the people and govern the country. This is more important than any military armament. If even civil servants are not organized and trained, then in wartime, the civil servants in the rear will panic, become disorganized, and even flee. No matter how many troops or weapons you have, you will fail in the front. Conversely, as long as all our civil servants are organized and trained, prepared for everything in peacetime, and able to remain calm and steadfast in wartime, with everyone doing their job and fulfilling their responsibilities in the appropriate place, then we can be self-reliant and stand firm no matter when or who we encounter. The significance and nature of civil servant training are as important as described above. Civil servants from all sectors, especially comrades from the Party, should participate enthusiastically and implement it earnestly, so that we can be modern civil servants and build a modern nation. Everyone should also know that the training of civil servants is related to the "labor service system" that I advocate. In spirit, both aim to dedicate each person's abilities to serve society and the nation, and to improve the welfare of the masses. In fact, the organization and training of civil servants is the most necessary and effective way to implement labor service. The purpose is to enable all citizens, whether in peacetime or wartime, to continue to labor and serve society and the nation in an organized and orderly manner. Our so-called revolution is to work hard and serve society and the nation, to passively alleviate the people's pain and difficulties, and to actively improve the welfare of all people. If our general revolutionary party members can work and serve society and the nation in this way, and achieve the Boy Scout motto of "doing one good deed a day," the general public will naturally respect and love us, and their faith in our revolutionary party will increase day by day. The problem is that some comrades cannot do this, do not understand the true meaning of revolution, which is to sacrifice all their own interests to work and serve the country and the people, and only know selfishness and self-interest, thus becoming selfish and self-interested people. Whether individual or group, party members or the Party, if they are selfish and self-interested, they will certainly not survive in this era. The purpose of my advocating labor service and the government's trial implementation of civil servant training is to cultivate the habit of labor service in our general civil servants, especially in general party members, to become modern citizens, and to fulfill our responsibility to build a modern nation. Furthermore, in the future, in addition to everyone having to labor and serve, everyone must also vow to be "honest and upright." Everyone must be able to abide by the law and achieve the two words "honest and upright," and truly build an honest and upright government. Only then can we establish a new society and a new nation. Therefore, "honest and upright" conduct is the first basic requirement for our revolutionary nation-building. From now on, all of us, from top to bottom, must encourage ourselves in this way. Since the remnant bandits in Jiangxi fled west last year and were pursued and attacked by the national army, although they have not yet been completely eliminated, I am confident that these remnant bandits will not be a problem in the future. Therefore, in terms of the overall national situation, it can be said that domestic military affairs have come to a considerable end by the end of last year. From now on, we only need to do the work of elimination. From this year onwards, the government can carefully plan and formally begin to build the country and people's livelihood in all aspects of politics, economy, education, and military affairs step by step. In particular, the government is determined to adhere to the spirit of independence and self-reliance in the economic field, fight to liberate itself from the heavy oppression of various old forces at home and abroad, and enable the entire country and all people to get rid of economic pain as soon as possible and find a way out. We have now begun to implement the government's plans and implement the government's policies. Those whose interests conflict with our country and people will naturally oppose the government, hinder the implementation of the government's policies, and want to return to China's previous financial and economic state, which will plunge the country and the people into an undead and unrecoverable hell. Therefore, they resort to all means, either saying that the government is corrupt or that officials are speculating, spreading rumors and slander, and doing everything they can to undermine financial credibility in order to subvert the government. Some party members who do not understand this content and his role, and even the party newspaper, echo this reactionary tune, wanting to keep the government's finances and finance in the hands of the old few people, and to permanently hinder the government's facilities for national economy and people's livelihood by making the country and the government rely on their whims. What was the previous financial situation? I can honestly say that the previous financial situation was that the old forces of domestic and foreign capital directly manipulated the government's finances and indirectly controlled the people's livelihood, so that all government measures had to listen to their orders. However, after the financial authorities have struggled for the past two years, the government now has independent economic policies and financial plans, and also has the determination and ability to be independent and self-reliant, and can no longer be restricted or manipulated by anyone. It is necessary to fight against all reactionary forces that hinder us from implementing new policies and new plans. Today, I can frankly report to you comrades that the financial and economic foundation of our country can be said to be stable. If we can continue to work hard together in this way, no one can shake the revolutionary foundation of our Chinese government anymore. Now these reactionary and selfish people always want to restore the previous financial and economic status quo, which is tantamount to being clever and cutting off their own retreat. However, the most important point is that since we now have an independent foundation to implement new plans and implement new policies, our Party, government, and military personnel must be especially honest and abide by the law, and absolutely honest, so that we can defeat all selfish and dark forces and complete our nation-building cause. In the government, I cannot casually interfere with other parts. As for the Executive Yuan and all military organs, I can definitely be responsible for achieving the two words "honest and upright." I dare to believe that there is no possibility of corruption among the staff under my command, and no corrupt officials are allowed to exist. If there are crimes of speculation and corruption among officials in the government, it is the crime of my President of the Executive Yuan. I will never evade or conceal it. In the future, if any government personnel have the slightest act of seeking personal gain, engaging in corruption, or perverting the law, it is not necessary to have complete evidence. As long as someone secretly reports to me, as long as he can be responsible for testifying, I can also be responsible for strictly keeping the name of the informer secret. I will immediately punish the corrupt person, whether civil or military, according to military law, and punish his direct superior with the same crime. If not, we cannot revitalize the country's discipline, strictly enforce revolutionary discipline, build an honest and upright government, and a modern nation. Today, Committee Member Dai has reported to everyone the fundamental spirit of the Premier's central legacy on revolutionary nation-building and the resolutions of previous Party congresses. The conclusion is that the purpose of our revolution is to revitalize China. To revitalize the nation, we must first establish a government that is not "lazy and opportunistic" and does not "embellish and fabricate." In other words, we must build a revolutionary government with the ability to take responsibility. How can this new government be built? The only important task is that the general comrades can be diligent, hardworking, honest, upright, and selfless, be loyal to the country, and create blessings for the people. I myself will certainly take "diligence" and "integrity" as my vow, set an example, and at the same time hope that all comrades will encourage themselves and others with diligence and integrity, and work together to strive to unleash the government's revolutionary power, build a solid foundation for the nation, and complete our major mission of revitalizing the nation.

<p>Rome. The talk that the Italian-Abyssinian war affects Europe is again powerful here today. It is said that although international relations have shown signs of progress on the surface recently, the war machine has become more acute than before. Sources familiar with the situation rumored that the munitions transported to Abyssinia via British Somaliland have gradually increased, and the sudden tension in international relations is due to this. In addition, Britain is now consolidating its army and air force in Egypt, and Britain and Italy are also actively strengthening their defenses in the Mediterranean and Red Sea regions. All of this has made foreign observers here believe that international tensions, contrary to general assumptions, are now increasing unabated. Italians have indicated that the British are now encouraging Abyssinia in various ways, and Italy will eventually be forced to consider responding to the threat of obstructing military operations. In short, if neither country is willing to change its policy, the discord between the two countries will inevitably continue to grow. But at present, neither country has indicated that it will change its policy. (National Telegram, 26th)</p>

<p>Addis Ababa. The battles on the northern front are quiet. After days of fierce fighting, both sides are exhausted, so they take a short rest and reorganize their troops. After that, fierce battles can occur at any time. According to a Reuters dispatch from Dessie, reports from official sources there stated that in the past few weeks, the Sidamo region in southern Abyssinia has been bombed by Italian planes twelve times, resulting in the deaths of more than 500 civilians. Italian planes are still bombing undefended towns. Unofficial sources also said that the Swedish Red Cross has telegraphed Addis Ababa, requesting that a plane be sent immediately to Sidamo to transport two injured Swedish Red Cross personnel to Addis Ababa. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>Rome. Military experts here predicted today that the Italian army would probably launch a general offensive against the Abyssinian army in the coming weeks. Most observers outside Italy indicated that this offensive was expected to be victorious. General Graziani, commander of the Italian army in Somalia, is now awaiting orders to advance from Geladi to Harar, and then turn north, or occupy the Djibouti-Addis Ababa Railway via Harar. According to unconfirmed reports from Neghelli, General Graziani's troops have already reached halfway to Harar. (National Press Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa. In recent days, heavy rain has been falling continuously in central Abyssinia, cutting off communication between the city of Dessie, where the Abyssinian Emperor is currently stationed, and the outside world. The capital is muddy and difficult to travel, like a swamp. It is also raining in Tigray Province, but it will not hinder military operations. As for the war news on the southern front, the government here is still strictly silent. (Havas, 26th)</p>

<p>London. Fierce battles between Italy and Abyssinia have been fought on the northern front since Sunday, lasting for five days. Both sides claim victory, but the losses are very large. According to a report from the Italian East African Command received in Rome, the Italian army managed to break the Abyssinian offensive in the Dambian area on January 19. The Third Italian Army Corps advanced southeast of Maikinetal and occupied two towns, preventing the enemy from advancing further. On the 21st, a branch of the Italian army advanced eastward to attack the Abyssinian army occupying the heights of Mount Latte, while the Second Blackshirt Division met the enemy coming from the north and south at the Uolou Pass. This operation was completely successful. After fierce fighting, the Italian army captured the Chibanchahaitai Plateau and forced the Abyssinian army to retreat to Mount Latte. The next day, the Abyssinian army launched a fierce attack on the Uolou Pass, hoping to reverse the defeat. After a fierce battle all day, the Italian army finally counterattacked and captured Mount Latte. On the 23rd, a branch of the Italian army joined the Second Blackshirt Division to completely repel the enemy on the entire front line. The continuous bombing by Italian planes greatly contributed to the Italian army's victory. However, the telephone report from the front received in Dessie completely contradicts the Italian war news. According to reports, the result of this decisive battle was a great victory for the Abyssinian army. The Abyssinian war report stated that Kassai and Seyoum would use agile strategies and mutually supportive actions to outflank the Italian army, so that the Italian army's repeated attacks would be in vain. Although the number of Italian troops deployed, the number of Italian deaths is as follows: 25 Italian officers killed, 19 injured, 389 Italian soldiers killed and injured, 310 local soldiers killed and injured. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>Rome. The Italian East African Command reported here today that there was a fierce battle on the southern front along the Ganale Dorya River last week. About 10,000 Abyssinian soldiers were killed, and the Italian casualties were not many. Only a few hundred local soldiers were killed and injured. Yesterday, the Blackshirt Division and the Abyssinian army led by Greek officers engaged in battle in the Maikinetal area. 200 Abyssinian soldiers were killed, and the Italian army seized a lot of military equipment and ammunition, and also occupied a wireless radio station with very high power. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa. The capital city held celebrations unanimously after hearing the report of a great victory on the northern front. Thousands of local people gathered to welcome the news of the Abyssinian army's great victory. It is now heard that the occupation of Maikinetal and the attack on Aksum are not far away. The Abyssinian official announced that the fierce fighting in the Tembien area resulted in the elimination of at least 3,000 Italian soldiers and the capture of hundreds of prisoners. The local people danced in the streets, sang war songs, and reiterated their oath to be loyal to the emperor and help him drive the invaders out of the country. At the same time, the military authorities are now considering a plan to consolidate the southern front, because it has been destroyed by Graziani's troops who have adopted an offensive stance. Senior officials firmly believe that the Ganale Dorya Basin is the Abyssinian army's natural guarantee. (National Press Agency, 26th)</p>

<p>Addis Ababa. The Italian government sent a telegram to the League of Nations on January 17, stating that the Italian side had collected 1,358 dumdum bullets in the areas of Eritraa and Taica. The Abyssinian government issued a notice today, stating that it was very surprised that the Italians admitted to picking up these bullets and not taking them back to their country as spoils of war. According to official statements, these dumdum bullets were transported by Italy, and the statistics of the Suez Canal can prove this. From June 25 to December 25, a total of 400,000 dumdum bullets passed through the Suez Canal. (National Telegram, 26th)</p>

<p>Cairo, Egypt. On the 4th of this month, an Egyptian Red Cross medical team near the town of Daggahbur in southern Abyssinia was bombed by Italian planes. Afterwards, the Committee for Medical Aid to Abyssinia here dispatched Hamid Said as an inspector to go to the scene of the incident to investigate the truth. According to a telegram from Hamid Said, it is clear that the Italian army should be held responsible for this case. The telegram stated that the Egyptian medical team was far away from the nearest camp of the Abyssinian army in Daggahbur. Before carrying out the bombing, the Italian planes hovered over the medical team more than once. Therefore, the Italian army must have been aware that there was an Egyptian medical team there. As for its implementation of the bombing, it had been carried out three times from the end of December last year to around the 4th of this month. The first time was on December 20 last year, when the Italian planes dropped bombs for 45 minutes. The second time was on December 31, when the bombs fell on other tents, so the medical team was not damaged. In this battle, Italian planes also dropped many leaflets, which read, "The Italian plane driver was unfortunately shot down during the bombing of Daggahbur, captured by the Abyssinian army, and brutally killed. The Italian army has come here for revenge." As for the third bombing, it was on January 4 of this year. In this battle, four Italian planes dropped bombs at the same time for 25 minutes, and finally destroyed all the tents of the medical team. I (the inspector) have also taken many photos at the scene of the incident, which can be used as evidence. (Havas, 26th)</p>

Germany does not want to be Abyssinia the second, and does not want airplanes and bombs to send civilization to Germany. The German army is not for war, but to protect working families. Germany is no longer an isolated island, but a place where defensive works have been established. Who can know the future? The Abyssinian war does not arouse Germany's interest, and events in the Far East are also unrelated to Germany, but Germany is paying attention to its development. (Reuters, 24th)</p>

<p>Tokyo. The Army Ministry authorities believe that the outcome of the current general election will have a significant impact on the political situation in the future, and are observing the situation with great attention. However, there are two different observations within the Army Ministry. The Army leadership, centered on Army Minister Kawashima, observes that Prime Minister Okada dissolved the parliament to implement Japan's withdrawal from the disarmament conference and to deal with the major situation in the future, hoping to develop the national destiny with the unity of the country. Therefore, the general election must be implemented fairly in order to revitalize parliamentary politics. This is one of the major missions of the current cabinet. Therefore, if the government fails, it will resign immediately, and if it wins, it will implement national policies with malevolent spirit. The middle-level group, centered on young soldiers, is dissatisfied with the Okada cabinet's national policies and advocates that its mission should be completed with the current general election, and it should resign immediately to establish a successor cabinet. Although the Army now has these two views, its solidarity movement is gradually proceeding powerfully, and it will issue opinions after the political situation of the future general election is clear, which will have a significant impact on the political world.

<p>Athens. The Greek general election began today, and it is hoped that this election will give Greece a constitutional monarchy. It is reported that the number of voters nationwide is very high, and the order is quite good. According to official sources yesterday, the Liberal Party has won 40% of the votes in Athens and the provinces of Attica and Boeotia. The mixed party and the People's Party of former Prime Minister Kondylis seem to have won more than 50% of the votes, and the other parties have won 10%. According to the report, although former Prime Minister Kondylis has contributed to welcoming King George back to the country to restore the monarchy, he resigned as Prime Minister due to disagreements with the King. He then formed a political party with Foreign Minister Tikitukis, which is the so-called mixed party. This election adopts a proportional representation system, so no party is likely to win an absolute majority. It is expected that the mixed party will win a slightly larger number of votes.

<p>Athens. The first general election in Greece after the restoration of the monarchy was held today. Although the political parties were fiercely competitive and people were uneasy, there were no major disputes in various places. The voting public was very enthusiastic. By noon, half of the registered voters had voted. Rumors have been spreading in recent days, saying that members of the Versailles party want to launch riots in Mastani and Athens, but the authorities are very vigilant and can control them even if such unfortunate events occur. The people are very hopeful for the outcome of the election. 1,668 candidates are competing for 300 seats in the parliament. Fifteen political parties are participating in this election, but in terms of the situation, the Liberal Party led by Sophocles and the People's Party led by former Prime Minister Tsaldaris are likely to be fierce rivals.

According to the latest statistics, the 300 seats in the National Assembly are distributed as follows: Liberal Party 235 seats, Kondylis' mixed party 125 seats, Communist Party 14 seats, and the remaining three small parties each have 1 or 8 seats. From this point of view, no single party can form a cabinet. Liberal Party leader Sophoulis claimed that he is ready to cooperate with the government in accordance with the King's wishes.

<p>Athens. As of now, the results of the parliamentary election are roughly as follows: the Liberal Party led by former Prime Minister Venizelos, from 135 seats to 140 seats; the People's Party led by former Prime Minister Tsaldaris, from 125 seats to 130 seats; the right-wing royalist party led by former envoy to Italy Metaxas, 8 to 10 seats; the Republican Party, 8 to 10 seats; the Communist Party, 10 seats.

According to the authorities, once the new House of Representatives is established, the current cabinet may have to be reorganized, and the current Prime Minister Demetzis (non-partisan) may form a national coalition cabinet, or the current cabinet may maintain the status quo.

<p>——Delivers Written Statement in Hong Kong——</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: After the news of Hu Hanmin's return to China and imminent arrival in Hong Kong spread, representatives from all sides flocked to Hong Kong. For a time, the coast of Hong Kong was filled with carriages and distinguished guests. Some were there specifically to welcome him, while others took the opportunity to engage in negotiations. The Victoria liner, carrying Hu, entered the harbor around 1:00 PM on the 19th, later than expected. Hong Kong gentlemen's welcoming boats and Guangdong provincial and municipal representatives' welcoming boats (over four hundred people) had already set out to greet it. At 1:30 PM, the Victoria liner docked. Ju Zheng and Ye Chucang, representatives of the Central government welcoming party, went to greet him by crossing the sea from Queen's Pier. The other Guangdong party and government representatives welcomed him on the sea in small boats. It is estimated that representatives from all sides used no less than thirty small boats. On the Victoria liner, Hu shook hands with welcoming personnel such as Ju Zheng, Zou Lu, Song Ce, Tang Haian, and Su Chucang. Hu looked fuller than before he left the country. He was wearing a gray satin long robe with a black mandarin jacket on this day. However, his gait was still unsteady and he needed assistance. Hu exchanged greetings with the welcoming party. Ju Zheng and others expressed the Central government's eagerness for him to preside over party affairs. Tang Haian and others also presented letters from important figures for him to read. Ju Zheng, Zou Lu, Ye Chucang, Tang Haian, and others then accompanied Hu onto the Britannia small boat, crossed the sea from the pier to the Hong Kong shore, disembarked at Queen's Pier, and took a car back to Hu's residence on Connaught Road for a short rest. At 2:00 PM, Chen Jitang arrived at Hu's residence to pay a visit and urged Hu to come to the province. In the afternoon, Hu attended and expressed gratitude at the Hong Kong gentry welcome meeting and the Hong Kong overseas Chinese groups' welcome rally. In the evening, Li Zongren, commander-in-chief of Guangxi Province, also rushed over from Guangzhou by car and visited Hu that night, discussing everything frankly. Hu released a written statement on this day, the text of which is as follows: "I have been away from my motherland for over six months in the blink of an eye. The purpose of my departure was to recuperate. Over the past six months, my health has still not fully recovered, but given the ongoing national crisis, I feel uneasy staying overseas for too long, so I have hurriedly returned east. My party and government principles remain the same as before. It is not easy to express them fully. In short, the Party should be restored to a party with principles and spirit, vigorously eliminating the mistakes of past fragmentation and disunity, and striving to continue the great cause of the Party's future. The government should be reformed into a responsible and capable government, vigorously correcting the mistakes of past fearfulness and complacency, in order to shoulder the heavy responsibility of resolving the national crisis and building the country. My attitude toward the domestic reality is judged by the above two points. Only in this way can I be guiltless before the people, guiltless before the Premier, and guiltless before myself. I am ashamed that I have been unable to do much for the country in the past six months abroad, but my observations are valuable for our people to learn from. When I have a little more time in the future, I will express them again." After Hu arrived in Hong Kong, Central government representatives Ju Zheng, Ye Chucang, Xu Chongji Lu, Mai Huanzhang, Zhang Renmin, Chen Yaoyuan, and Gui Chongji all visited him to discuss important party and national matters. Chen Jitang originally planned to stay in Hong Kong temporarily to welcome Hu to Guangzhou, but because Hu was tired from the journey and needed to rest in Hong Kong for a few days, and only agreed to come to the province after spending the Lunar New Year in Hong Kong, he would decide when to go to Beijing after arriving in the province. Chen did not wait any longer and returned to the province from Hong Kong on the Wu Feng warship with Du Yi and Lin Shiqing on the 20th. It is heard here that as Hu is about to go to the province, various groups and provincial and municipal party departments have prepared to hold welcome rallies. (January 20th)</p>

<p>I. Motivation for Departure</p>
<p>The northern provinces are the cultural heart of our country, and their governance, order, survival, and demise are closely related to the continuation of the nation's lifeblood and the people's fate. Last autumn, the Hebei-Chahar incident occurred, and the situation became increasingly precarious. Moreover, the breach of the Yellow River has not been closed, and the floods continue to spread. The great disaster of the future is unknown. Considering the truth of the evolution of the situation, the degree of the people's suffering, the direction of the social future, etc., all the people in this leaky boat of wind and rain who care about their fate must pay extremely close attention.

After the train started, he earnestly comforted him. There were also two young people who were graduates of Nanjing Wu Elementary school</p>

<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The end of the Lunar Year is the time for major settlements of accounts for various businesses. In the past year, all types of businesses in Guangdong Province have been affected by the economic downturn. There were no large-scale sales on credit for all goods. Even with trade, each store, due to a shortage of capital, did not dare to grant loans to businesses to facilitate turnover, avoiding being as helpless as in previous years. According to news from the Provincial Bank, at the end of the Lunar New Year, the amount of government (loan amounts) was at least one hundred yuan, or several hundred yuan, or thousands of yuan. In order to alleviate the situation, the Provincial Bank decided to issue the newly arrived legal tender and recover the previously issued promissory notes. Starting from February 11th, it will recover the one thousand yuan and five hundred yuan promissory notes. Starting from February 21st, it will recover the three hundred yuan, two hundred yuan, one hundred yuan, and fifty yuan (promissory notes). In terms of public security, the government was quick to declare temporary martial law due to conflicts between student patrols and assassination squads. Later, because order had returned, the matter was rescinded. Previously, this headquarters received an instruction from the Southwest Political Affairs Committee of the National Government, stating that students from various schools in Guangzhou were parading and causing conflicts with citizens, shooting and injuring several citizens. The actions were transgressive. Martial law was announced on the 3rd, and the Chief of Staff of this headquarters, Miao Peinan, was appointed as the Guangzhou Martial Law Commander, and temporary martial law regulations were formulated and ordered to be implemented. Reports and orders have been submitted and announced for compliance. Now, it is found that since the declaration of martial law in Guangzhou, students from various schools have ceased causing trouble, the turmoil has subsided, and local order has been restored. As the Lunar New Year is approaching, merchants' goods accounts are being settled, exchanges are frequent, and trade is flourishing. In order to facilitate merchants' transactions, it seems appropriate to announce the lifting of martial law to show flexibility. This headquarters has stated the reasons and requested instructions from the Southwest Political Affairs Committee of the National Government. Now, instructions have been received, approving compliance. We should comply, announce the lifting of martial law today, and abolish the Guangzhou Martial Law Command. In addition to submitting reports and orders separately, and ordering Guangzhou Martial Law Commander Miao Peinan to comply, and issuing orders to subordinates to comply, this announcement is hereby issued for the information of all sectors of the community. This announcement." (January 22nd)</p>

To the south is Qixia Temple, which contains the Monk Shao Stele personally written by Emperor Gaozong of the Tang Dynasty, with vigorous and beautiful calligraphy. In front of the hall are two ginkgo trees, which are from the Six Dynasties. In front of the temple is the Six Dynasties Pine, traditionally planted by Emperor Wu of Liang. In addition, famous scenic spots such as the Relic Pagoda, the Thousand Buddha Cliff, and the White Deer are worth visiting. I once remembered visiting Duzhongyuan's Zhaoxing Porcelain Factory in Shenyang, which he founded in northeast in the winter of 1930. A certain Japanese businessman also visited the factory and said to Du after the visit, "I have heard the voices of boycotting foreign goods in your country for a long time, but you must first produce inexpensive and high-quality domestic goods, such as the porcelain made by your factory, and then you can truly talk about boycotting foreign goods." These words are worthy of careful consideration and are still clear in my ears. In 1931, the September 18th Incident broke out. Du entered the customs to promote the national crisis, awaken the public, and continue his old business. He was planning to build a porcelain factory in the south. When the reporter was in Beijing, I was entrusted by letter to find soil from Qixia Mountain to be tested as raw materials. I went up the mountain with a stick and had a close encounter with the mountain spirits. Now that I passed by again, the beautiful scenery is still vivid in my mind, but Du was interrupted in his large-scale magnetic business in Jiangxi by the "newborn case" and was in jail. Seeing the scenery and feeling emotional, looking back on the past, I can't help but feel emotional. After a while, I arrived in Nanjing and stayed in Dongxiao for a while.</p>
<p>III. The Capital's Scenery</p>
<p>Nanjing controls the Yangtze River to the north and connects Shanghai to the east, with the benefits of shipping, connecting to the provinces and reaching foreign oceans. In addition, the Jinghu, Jinghan, Jingwu and other routes connect transportation, allowing it to take the central position to control inside and outside the region. It is a pity that inland river navigation rights have not been recovered, and air defense equipment has yet to be planned, resulting in unavoidable international maritime and air threats. The city wall is grand and magnificent, with a circumference of ninety-six li (formerly there was an outer city, with a circumference of one hundred and eighty li and eighteen gates, which has been reduced to ruins). The gate has seventeen openings and is the largest city wall in our country. In 1927, the National Revolutionary Army settled the southeast and established its capital here. Over the years, the population has increased year by year. Every year and a half the reporter entered Beijing, I felt that the old wasteland and vegetable gardens had decreased, and the number of agencies, hotels, apartments, banks, shops, and other new buildings had increased. Pedestrians come and go, and carriages meet one after another, all showing a prosperous scene.</p>
<p>IV. Scenes Under the Seamless Sky</p>
<p>Taking the Jinpu train north, the climate became increasingly cold, the vegetation withered, and the sunlight dimmed. The steam sprayed from the front of the train condensed into thick fog as it exited the chimney. Along the way, in the forest along the road, there were often three to five groups of children carrying baskets and brooms, competing to sweep fallen leaves. If they encountered a ruthless north wind, roaring and arriving, they would immediately shrink their necks, cover their ears, squat on the ground and lean on the basket, staring at the fallen leaves being blown away piece by piece, a very pitiful sight. Late winter is the farmers' off-season, and those who can barely make a living live a simple life, so it is often difficult to see a single person even after walking dozens of miles. Insects and birds are hibernating and silent, everything is in a static state, only the light green wheat seedlings have a little vitality.</p>
<p>Passing the Chedaokou of Xuzhou at night, I investigated that after the breaches of the Yellow River Dongzhuang, it first hit western Shandong and then flooded northern Jiangsu, seventeen counties, with an area of more than 100,000 hectares. It has been more than half a year since then. This place happened to be at the outer impact of the Changwei Mountain Lake overflow, and the surrounding area was full of yellow water. The cold mountains and isolated villages were like islands. The car was rumbling, as if a ship was moving forward. Near the shore, it seemed to be frozen, and I could vaguely hear the sound of cracking. In the distance, I could see the mountains, and then I drove into a land area with many sorghum stalk nests, in which there must be crouching disaster victims. The nests had many cracks, how could they block the invasion of the cold wind. When entering Hanzhuang in Shandong Province, this train that broke through the waves abandoned land travel and rushed to the water town. Weishan Lake is two li northwest of the station, and there is also a canal that runs diagonally across the south of the station. Since the Yellow River disaster spread, nearby villages have gradually sunk. Looking out the window on a moonlit night, the water is connected to the sky, the sky tells the water, and the white light is diffused, as if it were a seamless sky. It is a real scene of the four characters "water and sky are the same color." If this scene were on a beautiful spring day and was only limited to the surface of Weishan Lake, poets and writers would not know how to praise its beauty. Today, in this seamless sky, countless wailing wild geese are rolled up, and countless good fields, beautiful lands, and villages are flooded. Not only can you not see the beauty of the scenery, but it is suitable for enhancing people's tragic imagination. Among the passengers, there were acrobats, six people in a group, with swords and halberds, but their clothes were old. One of them had traveled to Weishan Lake and described the scenery as follows: "There are mountains in the lake, which are said to be the place where Weizi finally lived. There is the tomb of Weizi on the south side of the mountain, and two li south of the tomb, there is the tomb of Zhang Zifang. The tomb has jujube trees, which are several times around in circumference, with branches like dragons, ancient and vigorous and spectacular. The mountain is beautiful, with more than ten villages. Their daily lives are like living in a paradise. Today, the mountains are surrounded by floods, and they must have been affected and unable to live in peace as before." Someone asked about the acrobats' livelihood, and he replied bluntly, "This kind of career used to be able to support ourselves everywhere, but now it is difficult everywhere. In the city, we are squeezed out by new magic tricks, and in remote areas, there are no wealthy viewers. After all, acrobatics are false and untrue, and no one will watch them again after they are seen through. Learning magic is also acrobatics. Viewers cannot be deceived again and again, so the future is not optimistic." The words contained other meanings, and the listeners were moved. The group originally wanted to get off the train in Teng County, but because it was not far from the disaster area, they continued to buy tickets to Zou County. A passenger laughed and said, "Zou County is the hometown where sages grew up. Meng taught moving studies. Don't play around. The ancient teachings are clear. I am afraid that your journey will not be great." They could not answer, but there was nothing to worry about. They knew that deception was not reliable, but they still did not change careers, which was confusing.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Shandong Province: After the Destruction of the Juye Dike <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>——The Yellow River Blocking Project is Greatly Facilitated——</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Shandong Yellow River blockade project, after Juye's dike and Dongwang people's dikes were successively destroyed on the 17th and 18th, the water flowed northeast along the former Yellow River course of Li Sheng Tun, established in 1925. The flow of the Dongzhuang mouth in the main river was greatly reduced. Jiangsu's efforts to extend the dike have also been helpful, and the excavation of the western dike has also aided the project. Kong Xiangrong is currently supervising everything at the Dongzhuang mouth and has wired the county magistrates of Juye, Yuncheng, Pu County, Fan County, and Heze to quickly recruit laborers to actively excavate the large lead river north of Li Sheng Tun, in order to find an opportunity to advance and fill the breach and meet early, so that the people can obtain spring plowing. According to Kong Xiangrong's report from the Dongzhuang project on the 25th, the total river flow was only 630 cubic meters per second, and the outflow from the breach accounted for 360 cubic meters per second. The Juye people's dike has collapsed. The embankment on the south bank has been in disrepair for a long time and is worrying. The Shandong River Bureau has the responsibility to defend it and is making efforts to prevent it. A portion of the water still flows into the Lusu disaster area. The old river has benefited from the extension of the Jiangsu dike, and has been aided by the excavation of the base of the west dike. The small lead river near Li Sheng Tun was excavated and drained smoothly, and the newly silted old river has the ability to pass water. The plan is completed, and the counties are being notified by wire to recruit laborers to excavate the large lead river north of Li Sheng Tun. Prepare to excavate the river when the water rises, guide the water downstream, and start blocking early to meet the needs of the disaster victims to obtain spring farming. Regarding the construction of the large lead river, Kong Xiangrong proposed this case at the National Water Conservancy Conference, and it has been approved. Kong has sent an urgent telegram to the Shandong Provincial Government and the Puyang, Fan, Ju, and Yun counties to limit the amount of labor to be provided to aid the main project. Regarding the breach of the people's dike in Juye, since it has diverted in Yun, Ju, and other counties, due to the severe cold weather, the water flows and freezes, so it has slowly progressed towards Huanghuasi in Chenji, Shou Zhang County. On the 26th, it flowed to Huanghuasi and merged with the local stagnant water, connecting to the main river, with a water depth of only five centimeters. As for the dike on the south bank, there is no danger now. Chen Wenmo, the head of the upper reaches of the Yellow River, has reported the situation to the River Affairs Bureau. The Dongzhuang mouth is affected and is of concern to all parties. The commission has sent personnel to the mouth to survey. National League of Nations water conservancy experts Puderly, Gusang, etc., arrived from Beijing on the 26th at 8:00 PM, and will go to Juye to inspect on the 27th. The Yellow River Water Conservancy Office in Jinan has sent a telegram to Kong Xiangrong to prepare to take care of them. Wang Lutai, the director of the office, will go to Qingdao to purchase a large amount of wood for the blockade work. (Evening of the 26th)</p>

<p>After the January 28th Incident, all industries in Wuyi were affected by the economic panic, rural decline, and falling prices. The fast year was nothing to talk about. In the first half of 1935, there was no improvement. Until the second half of September and October, there was a bumper harvest of agricultural products in the countryside, and there was a slight activity. Since the promulgation of the central legal tender, prices have been raised, and the commercial market has suddenly shown a thriving trend. Therefore, at the end of the year, all stores with existing inventory were able to profit, especially yarn mills and cloth factories, which made even more profits, such as Dacheng and Minfeng yarn mills, which made tens of thousands or one or two hundred thousand yuan. The original business in the county, with soybeans and wood as the main commodities, also had a surplus at the end of the year. There is also the oil mill industry, due to the continuous source of soybeans in Anhui Province, the price of oil has increased sharply, and a large profit has been made. In addition, foreign and general merchandise industries, and silk and cloth industries, etc., have been doing well in the winter months. Rising prices have made up for the losses in the first half of the year with a surplus, so they were able to pass safely during the grand closing. This spring, there are very few stores that are closed down or bankrupt, and the market has slightly changed.</p>

<h3 id="e88">Letter <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>To the Editor of this newspaper: I recently read an article in your newspaper on the 17th of this month, page 6, which said, "Jingxing Mine Suspended Due to Water Inrush." I was shocked by this news. Our Lincheng Mine, which belongs to the Hebei Provincial Mining Supervision Committee, suffered a water leakage at the bottom of the eighth-level coal mine on the 26th of last month. At that time, the water volume was very large, and it was difficult to suck and save. At present, we are planning to discuss rescue measures. The Jingxing Mine, which belongs to the committee, is still mining coal as usual, and there is no water inrush. I am afraid that the rumors are not true, so I hereby request a correction.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Methods for Strengthening the Body by Wu Yunrui, Director of Physical Education at National Central University <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>I. The Meaning of a Strong Body Lies in Discussing Methods for Strengthening the Body. Before discussing methods, it is necessary to explain the meaning of a strong body. This is because meaning and method are related; different meanings imply different methods. The common understanding of "strong" usually involves two meanings. The first is on the passive side: the body is free from disease, and various organs are in a normal state. The second is on the active side: a person has a good appetite, sleeps well, possesses bodily strength, has energy for work, does not tire easily, and feels happy. From these two points, the first is essentially health, and the second is physical development. The meaning of a "strong body" is nothing beyond these two aspects.</p>
<p>II. Methods for Strengthening the Body. Since the previous section divides the meaning of "strong" into health and development, the methods for strengthening the body should be considered from these two perspectives. The first, the active method for strengthening the body, is to emphasize physical education. The function of physical education is not solely for strengthening the body, but to strengthen the body, one must emphasize physical education, practice exercises, and engage in sports. During exercises or sports, one either uses the body to move the body, or the body to move objects. For example, gymnastics and apparatus exercises involve the body moving the body, while ball sports involve the body moving objects. Both types of exercise require the use of strength. Because of the use of strength, muscles respond to the demands of exercise or practice by increasing the number of fibers, resulting in muscle development and increased strength. Moreover, during exercise, chemical reactions occur within the body's muscles, where nutrients (from carbohydrate-rich foods) combine with oxygen. The more one exercises, the more nutrients and oxygen are consumed. When people engage in exercise regularly, organs for absorbing nutrients, such as the digestive system, and organs for absorbing oxygen, such as the respiratory system, become more developed. Organs for transporting oxygen and nutrients, such as the circulatory system, also become developed. Furthermore, exercise generates waste products, such as urea and carbon dioxide, which must be transported away by specialized organs, leading to the development of the excretory system. In addition, during exercise, muscle activity is regulated by the nervous system. The more complex and skillful the movements, the more complex the coordination between the nerves and muscles. Thus, exercise promotes the development of the nervous system. From this perspective, physical training and exercise can result in increased bodily agility and strength, increased appetite, and stronger heart, lungs, internal organs, and other organs such as the liver, pancreas, kidneys, large and small intestines, and stomach. To achieve this goal, one must engage in a sufficient amount of exercise daily. According to the research of American physical education expert Helhernston, elementary school students should have at least four hours of activity daily, middle school students should have two to three hours of activity daily, and adults should have one hour of activity daily. If one's occupation prevents extensive exercise, one should average at least thirty minutes of activity daily, or one hour of activity every other day. There are many types of activities; the choice depends on individual skills, interests, economic status, and habits. If one has never learned track and field or ball sports, younger people can engage in learning, while older people can choose simpler exercises. For example, it is best if Chinese people over forty can play tennis or golf. If not, they can practice Tai Chi or other martial arts. If one does not like martial arts, one can go hiking in the countryside on Sundays. If one has an interest in a certain type of exercise, one should do that exercise. For example, Germans are fond of apparatus exercises, and some over sixty still do apparatus exercises. If one has the economic means to buy golf clubs and build a golf course, one may also pursue one's preferences. However, the most important thing is that one must have a certain level of skill in an exercise. Skill leads to interest. Furthermore, if one wants to maintain a strong body throughout life, one must maintain exercise and practice throughout life. To be able to maintain practice without interruption, one must have the habit and interest in exercise. This habit and interest in exercise is not cultivated in old age, but is cultivated from a young age when the active nature is discovered. If one does not cultivate it when young, it will not be possible when one is old, just as the habit and skill of a cat catching mice comes from playing with a ball with its front paws when it is young. If one does not learn when young, one will not have that habit when old. Therefore, physical education in primary and secondary schools is very important; the habit and interest in exercise must be cultivated at that time. The reason why most people in society today do not know about and are not interested in exercise is that they did not emphasize physical education in school. If these people want to strengthen their bodies, they must resolve to choose an exercise and work hard at practicing it, whether it is learning to play tennis, learning Tai Chi, or, if there is a golf course, learning to play golf.</p>
<p>In addition, a weak body is due to excessive expenditure of energy, insufficient rest for the nervous system, and the degradation of the functions of other organs. Everyone must understand that when one sits in an office to work, reads in a library, or writes articles in a study, although one does not pant, one's heart does not beat fast, and one's limbs do not move, one consumes a great deal of energy. For example, if one works hard late into the night, writing articles or reading, it can cause blood to accumulate in the brain, leading to insomnia. There are also various dangerous phenomena, such as indigestion, poor appetite, and unlimited consumption of nutrients in the body, eventually leading to physical weakness and a haggard appearance. These are all signs of a weak body. If one engages in exercise, one can divert the blood from the brain to the muscles. One can forget the problems that occupy the mind. In this way, one can sleep easily, have a good appetite, and conserve energy. Therefore, to have a strong body, one must also use exercise to regulate the body and mind. The greater one's career, the more important it is to have a strong body. Zeng Wenzhenggong took it upon himself to quell rebellions and resolve difficulties. He meditated for thirty minutes every day and took a slow walk of five hundred steps after meals. Meditation has the meaning of conserving energy, and slow walking has the meaning of exercise. At that time, because physical education had not been promoted, the literati did not know about exercise, but Zeng Wenzhenggong had already practiced physical education training. Now that we know dozens of types of exercise, instead of using exercise to strengthen the body and spend our time, some people use activities that harm the body, such as prostitution and gambling, to pass the time. It is truly a pity. Today we are discussing active methods for strengthening the body. There are also active methods for protecting the body, which are closely related to strengthening the body, which will be discussed in the next issue.</p>
<p>The second, the passive method for strengthening the body, is to emphasize hygiene, because hygiene and physical education must complement each other; neither is dispensable. Having physical education but not emphasizing hygiene can completely destroy the effects of physical education training. For example, an athlete with abundant physical strength and energetic spirit, if he eats carelessly, consumes indigestible food, and drinks unclean cold water, may contract typhoid fever or dysentery, resulting in physical decline and diminished spirit. The so-called strong physique will no longer be seen. Therefore, hygiene and physical education mutually maintain a strong body. What are the methods of hygiene? They can be divided into several aspects.</p>
<p>Hygienic Habits. This refers to one's usual eating, sleeping, working, resting, and other overall lifestyle habits, which have a significant impact on the body. This can also be divided into several aspects.</p>
<p>A. Eating Habits. Diet is the source of energy. A proper diet is sufficient to nourish the body, while an improper diet is sufficient to harm the body. There are three major categories of food that meet our needs. The first is protein (i.e., meat, eggs, etc.). Two hundred grams of this type of food per day is sufficient, and more is not harmful, but excess will still be excreted by the kidneys, because protein cannot be stored in the body except to replenish body tissues. Some people eat a lot of meat, which puts too much burden on the kidneys, which is sufficient to harm the kidneys. In the past, Yuan Shikai had to eat a duck every day, and eventually died of kidney disease. Yuan Shikai had a short and stout build, belonging to the lateral type, which is prone to kidney disease, partly because he ate too much meat. Therefore, short and stout people should eat less meat and more vegetables. The second type of food is carbohydrates, i.e., rice, noodles, sugar, etc. If one eats a lot of this type of food and can digest it, it can be stored in the body. If one eats too much, it is not easy to digest, or even if it can be digested, the person will be listless, because the blood has all gone to the stomach to do the work of digestion. The third type of food is fat, i.e., butter, lard, soybean oil, etc. After digestion, this type of food has the same function as carbohydrates, but it is not easy to digest if one eats too much. Fried foods should not be eaten often, such as fried dough sticks. Eating too much is not hygienic. In addition, there are so-called protective elements, commonly called vitamins. There are five types of them, which do not exist independently, but are often contained in food. Vitamin A is present in fats, such as butter and cod liver oil, and also in carrots and spinach, but there is none in lard. Not eating this type of protective element can easily cause diseases such as conjunctivitis. Vitamin B is present in seeds and animal eggs. When rice is too white, this vitamin is ground away. If one does not eat this vitamin, one will develop neuritis and beriberi. Vitamin C is present in citrus fruits, tomatoes, and vegetables. If one does not eat this vitamin, one will develop anemia, bleeding of the oral mucosa, weakness, and scurvy. Vitamin D is present in butter and vegetable fats. If children do not eat this vitamin, they will develop rickets. There is also vitamin E, which is present in egg yolks, lettuce, and liver. Not eating it will prevent reproduction. Therefore, one's diet must be balanced, and all essential nutrients must be included. Many people only choose to eat what tastes good. Things that do not taste good but are beneficial to the body must also be eaten a little. There are also many people who like to eat snacks, which is sufficient to spoil the appetite. People who emphasize hygiene must absolutely not develop this bad habit. Furthermore, some people eat very quickly, which is also not good, because some foods, such as rice, are digested in the mouth, while others, such as meat and oils, are digested in the stomach and intestines. Eating slowly and chewing carefully makes it easier for digestive juices to digest it, and digestive juices can be produced more easily, making digestion easier. Therefore, one must have the habit of chewing more and eating slowly. In addition, as for drinks, one should drink more water, at least four pounds a day. Other things like alcohol and coffee should not be drunk often.</p>
<p>B. Excretion Habits. This refers to bowel movement habits. One should have at least one or two bowel movements per day, preferably in the morning or after drinking. In the morning, at home or in one's residence, it becomes a habit that is not easily forgotten. At noon or in the evening, when going out to work or socialize, it is easy to forget. But after it becomes a habit, it will come on time and will never be delayed. If one hopes to develop a habit, it is best to go to the toilet at a fixed time (morning or after meals). After a long time, one will have the feeling of elimination and will not need to use willpower to manage it. Bowel movements need to occur daily because feces accumulating in the intestines easily decay and produce indoles and scatoles, which reduce one's resistance and make it easy to develop other diseases.</p>
<p>C. Sleep Habits. Sleep is the most complete method of rest. Although one is resting when one sits in a garden or in a teahouse, one still uses some brain and muscle power. As for sleep, all the muscles in the body are completely relaxed, and the brain also stops working. Even if one is very tired during the day, one can completely recover from fatigue if one sleeps for eight or nine hours. Therefore, sleep is very important if one hopes to have a strong body. It is best to develop the habit of falling asleep at a certain time at ten or eleven o'clock and the habit of getting up at a certain time at six or seven o'clock the next day. If one has hobbies, likes to dance, likes to play cards, and does it all night long, one's body will definitely suffer a great loss. Even if one exercises to strengthen the body, it will have no effect at all. In addition, there are other matters that should be noted incidentally, such as not covering one's face with the blanket when sleeping, and also opening one or two windows, because fresh air makes for better sleep.</p>
<p>D. Cleanliness Habits. This includes many things. The most important is brushing one's teeth in the morning and after meals, because food scraps remaining between the teeth can decay and produce acids, which easily cause tooth decay. After decay, it will hurt, and one must either fill or extract the tooth. Even if it can be filled well, it is not easy to maintain it without it deteriorating again. Bad teeth lead to indigestion, insufficient nutrition, and a direct relationship with physical strength. Therefore, this habit of brushing one's teeth must be cultivated. Foreigners pay close attention to the habit of washing hands before eating, because foreigners eat bread with their hands. Although Chinese people use chopsticks instead of hands, there are also places where hands are used. If the hands are not clean, microorganisms can easily enter the mouth, which is very dangerous. Therefore, the habit of washing hands before eating should also be cultivated. In addition, there is also the habit of bathing the body. The skin is an excretory organ that excretes fat and dirt at all times. If one does not bathe, excretion will not be smooth. Therefore, one should bathe every day in the summer and at least once a week in the winter.</p>
<p>E. Work and Rest Habits. We have to work for a living. It is best if one's work is regulated every day. When the work is done, one should rest or take a walk. If one works or does things all day long without rest, too much energy is consumed, and the body will suffer. Therefore, one should rest immediately after working for a certain amount of time. When resting, one can either stroll in the park, visit the countryside with friends, or climb mountains to recuperate the body and mind.</p>
<p>F. Exercise Habits. This is the active method for strengthening the body mentioned in the previous section. It is also acceptable to exercise regularly every day or to exercise once a day.</p>
<p>The above six habits of A, B, C, D, E, and F can encompass one's usual life. There are also special matters that those who want to have a strong body must also know, which is the following item.</p>
<p>Common Knowledge for Preventing Infectious Diseases. There are several types of infectious diseases, some of which are extremely dangerous, such as typhoid fever, smallpox, diphtheria, cholera, and scarlet fever. Medicine is now very advanced. Not to mention smallpox, cowpox was invented long ago. For other diseases such as typhoid fever, diphtheria, cholera, and scarlet fever, there are preventive injections that can be given. Although it is not possible to be absolutely immune from infection after getting the injection, it is much better than not getting it. If one has contracted an infectious disease, such as diphtheria or cholera, one must be sent to the hospital for treatment as soon as possible, and it is best to isolate oneself from the family to prevent infecting family members.</p>
<p>In addition, there is also common knowledge about public health, which is directly or indirectly related to life. Due to time constraints, I cannot go into detail. The end.</p>

<p>Chairman Hu Zhantang of the Central Standing Committee, who decided to return to China on the Italian mail ship Victoria, arrived in Hong Kong on the 19th. The Central Committee specially dispatched Ju Zheng, President of the Judicial Yuan, Ye Chucang, Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters, and Chen Ce, a member of the Central Committee, to Hong Kong to welcome him. Hu then went to Guangzhou for a visit and is scheduled to come north at the beginning of next month. Ju and the others, due to urgent political affairs in Beijing, took the Dollar Line's President Coolidge to return to Shanghai yesterday and returned to Beijing that night to report their mission. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai This Morning and Returned to Beijing That Evening. Ju, Ye, and Chen arrived in Hong Kong on the 15th. In addition to meeting Hu Zhantang in Hong Kong, they also visited Guangzhou. As Hu must come north at the beginning of next month, and Ju and the others have urgent political affairs in Beijing, they accompanied Tang Haian, the representative of Minister of Finance Kong, and Meng Chuanying, the chief of the telecommunications section of the Central Party Headquarters, on the Dollar Line's President Coolidge on the 25th to return north first. They entered the port yesterday at dawn and docked at berths 16 and 17 on the river. Those who came to welcome them included Li Dachao, the representative of Mayor Wu; Wang Zhinan, the representative of Yang Hu, the director of the Municipal Security Office; Cai Jingjun, the director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau; Pan Gongzhan and Wu Kaixian, members of the Central Committee; and reportedly Tang Zhaoshi, the secretary of the Jianghai Customs Superintendent's Office; and Qian Cangshuo, Ye Jiping, and Wang Gongtao. Ju and the others then took a small Public Security Bureau boat across the river at around 8 a.m. and disembarked at the New Customs Pier. They went straight to their residence to rest. Mayor Wu scheduled a dinner at his private residence on Haige Road at 7 p.m. to welcome Ju, Ye, Chen, and the others. Ju and the others will take the night train to Beijing at 11 p.m. to report everything to the Central Committee.</p>
<p>Ju and Ye Released a Joint Statement. Ju and Ye released a joint written statement on the ship, saying, "This time, we went to Hong Kong as representatives of the Central Committee to welcome Mr. Hu Zhantang back to the country to preside over the central government. We received enthusiastic hospitality from comrades in Hong Kong and Guangzhou, which was exceptionally pleasant. Mr. Hu arrived in Hong Kong at 2 p.m. on the 19th. His hair is gradually turning white, but his spirit is still the same. We heard that the waves were extremely high when the ship passed Singapore, and all the passengers were seasick, but Mr. Hu slept and ate as usual. We were all delighted to hear this. We met Mr. Hu five times, and the three meetings were more detailed. He inquired in great detail about the major plans of the party and the country, and his guidance was extremely pertinent. As for the date of his arrival in Shanghai, it is scheduled for the beginning of February, because he has not returned to his home province for four years and must go back to sweep his ancestral tombs. In addition, he cannot refuse the enthusiastic welcome from the party, government, military, and all sectors in Guangzhou. He will stay in the province for three or four days and then return to Hong Kong to wait for a ship to come north."</p>
<p>Visited Wang and Personally Delivered Hu's Reply Letter. Ju Zheng, Ye Chucang, and Chen Ce, the three representatives sent by the Central Committee to welcome Hu in the south, visited Wang Jingwei at Anhe Temple Road yesterday morning and personally delivered Hu Hanmin's reply letter to Wang. It is reported that the letter mainly stated that Hu was very grateful for Wang's concern and comforted Wang's injuries and illnesses. He said that the long journey was tiring and he needed to rest for a while. Once he recovered, he would go north to meet him. Wang was very pleased to receive the letter and inquired in detail about Hu's health and his views on the current situation. Ju, Ye, and Chen talked at Wang's residence for thirty minutes before leaving.</p>
<p>Hu Will Come North at the Beginning of Next Month. A Hong Kong telegram said that Hu Zhantang would leave Hong Kong on the 29th on the Changxing Company's Asia Queen. However, according to the news received yesterday, Hu was afraid that it would be difficult to take that ship because the time was too short. Ju and Ye said that Hu would definitely come to Shanghai at the beginning of February, but the exact date had not yet been determined. According to Tang Haian, Hu will probably take the Dollar Line's President Jackson from Hong Kong to Shanghai. The ship is scheduled to leave Hong Kong on February 1 and should arrive in Shanghai on the 3rd.</p>
<h3 id="e91">After the Resignations of the Directors, Supervisors, and General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company - All Employees Retained Them - Submitting Telegrams to President Jiang of the Executive Yuan and Acting Minister Yu Separately <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Since Liu Hongsheng and all the directors and supervisors of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company reorganized it, its business has been improving and its foundation has been strengthening. Recently, after all the directors and supervisors submitted their resignations, all the employees of the company's land and sea departments were panicked and lost their leadership. The other day, they telegraphed President Jiang of the Executive Yuan and Minister Yu, earnestly urging them to stay. The original telegram is as follows:</p>
<p>Rapidly translate the Nanjing China Merchants Branch and submit it separately to President Jiang of the Executive Yuan and Acting Minister Yu of the Ministry of Communications. Greetings, We believe that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is the only shipping organization in our country, which is of great importance to the national economy and maritime transportation. Since the winter of the 21st year of the Republic, it was ordered to be changed to state-owned, and the central government specially appointed Liu Hongsheng as the general manager and appointed celebrities from the financial and industrial circles of the country as supervisors and directors to jointly take charge of the reorganization. In the past three years, everything has been revived. To mention its major development plans, such as improving the operations of the branch offices, reducing redundant staff, and increasing revenue; eliminating the long-standing malpractices of the tea room, training and assigning service personnel, and winning the praise of travelers; strictly prohibiting smuggling and smuggling, and charging fees for tips, and turning private into public; establishing water and land intermodal transportation, expanding business, and strengthening the foundation; building new Jianghai ships, enriching shipping, and greatly increasing production; repairing docks and warehouses, determining schedules, and promoting business. The decisions made and implemented in the reorganization plan, such as strictly selecting and employing personnel, paying attention to supplies, eliminating foreign employees, and employing Chinese people, saving huge amounts of waste, and eliminating loopholes in order to promote the efficiency of work. The employment and administration of personnel can pay attention to talents and uphold impartiality, which has the effect of internal and external support and the help of collective wisdom. However, the reward and punishment rules for crew members related to faith, and the salary improvement system related to livelihood, have long been legally approved, but have not been promulgated and implemented. It is inevitable that there will be regrets. However, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which is full of holes, and the deep-rooted inside story, have been carefully studied by General Manager Liu and overseen by the directors and supervisors. They have shared the great difficulties and persevered to make the bureau turn from danger to safety, the business recover from decline, and the foundation strengthen day by day. The smooth road can be followed, which is not just lucky. We have followed for a long time, and we are closely related. We are sincerely cooperating with the boat to overcome the difficulties and achieve the success of the last step. Suddenly, we heard that all the supervisors, directors, and General Manager Liu and others had resigned to the central government. Although the central government has repeatedly urged them to stay, it has not been able to dispel the resignation intentions of General Manager Liu and others. Thinking that we cannot grasp their clothes and hate that we cannot turn back the reins, we are all panicked and lose our leadership. At this time, when the bureau's affairs are well organized, how can we listen to their high retreat and suddenly unload their responsibilities? We dare to jointly submit a request to your excellency, urging you to stay and manage with the worthy, as for how to reorganize the old debts and allocate certain funds in the bureau, the central government has long had a way. Please fulfill our request to retain all the directors, supervisors, and General Manager Liu, we are extremely urgent and apprehensive. Jointly bow, the Public Welfare Association of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, all the engine operators, drivers, radio operators, Jiangjiang, business directors, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Junan Society, all the employees of the docks, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Machine Factory, all the employees, and all the employees of the inland China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Pardon.</p>

Foreign bank associations have issued a notice of closure to mourn the passing of the British monarch. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Businesses Reopen: Yesterday was the fourth day of the first month of the lunar calendar. The old customs of various businesses have not been eliminated; all welcome the God of Wealth. Vendors selling "yuan dou fish" (a type of fish symbolizing wealth) were everywhere. Regular business resumes today. Banks were originally scheduled to be closed for three days, but because the 26th is a regular Sunday holiday, one additional day was added. Banks are permitted to reopen today. Money shops are scheduled to resume trading today. The Bankers' Association, Clearing House, Bank Preparation Committee, as well as the Money Industry Association, Money Market, and Money Preparation Treasury will all begin operations at the same time. The Chinese Securities Exchange will also resume trading as usual today. Various shipping companies will also resume operations today.</p>
<p>Money Shops Resume Trading: The money industry traditionally resumes trading today. Members of the association are divided into those who have entered the market ("entered the garden") and those who have not. Members who have entered the market are called "exchange shops," while those who have not are called "tiaoda shops" (referring to a type of transaction). They are categorized into Yuan, Hengli, Zhen, and Shi, all being fellow money industry practitioners. The Hengli Zhen member shops primarily focus on cash exchange and bill of exchange businesses. The Money Exchange Industry Tongyi Association has already been established.

<p>All Made Profits: A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the money industry yesterday that member money shops of the Money Industry Trade Association, that is, exchange shops, despite operating during a period of economic downturn in the 24th year of the Republic of China, all made profits due to prudent management. Fortune sources such as Zifeng enjoyed the most profits, reportedly ranging from 10,000 to 500,000 yuan. Only a few broke even. Apart from Yi Sheng and Zhi Cheng, which have closed because shareholders have no intention of continuing operations, all others will resume trading today.</p>
<p>Lively Evening: In both the northern and southern parts of the city and in the concessions, after settling accounts at the end of the year, shops and firms rested for several days. Yesterday and today, the fourth and fifth days of the lunar new year, is traditionally a time to welcome the God of Wealth. Therefore, all shops, large and small, are offering paper images of the God of Wealth, preparing incense, candles, ingots, firecrackers, and gongs and drums. The sound of firecrackers continued throughout the night. In the city, the City God Temple and Yuyuan Garden were packed with visitors yesterday.

At 2 PM this afternoon, a solemn public memorial service will be held at the Tomb of the Unknown Heroes in Miaohang Town to express grief.</p>
<p>Letter to the Citizens: At the same time, the association issued a letter to the citizens of the city, stating, "Time flies like a stream, and the Shanghai War of January 28th has passed its fourth anniversary in an instant. In these four years, foreign aggression has become increasingly urgent, and internal strife is constantly in mind. Thinking of this, our hearts are saddened. However, the past is gone, and those who come should take a moment of pleasure and make a firm determination to revitalize and avenge this shame."</p>
<p>Lowering Flags to Express Grief: All government agencies, organizations, schools, factories, and stores should lower their flags to half-mast for one day to commemorate the martyred soldiers and civilians, to comfort their loyal souls, and to encourage those who come after.</p>
<p>Memorial at the Loyal Tomb: Cai Xiangsun and Lu Zhengyu, directors of the Jiangwan Chongshan Hall, initiated a burial team after the January 28th Shanghai War, collecting and burying more than 1,300 bodies of soldiers and civilians. Mr. Wang Weiguan, a Shanghai merchant, generously donated coffins, costing more than 10,000 gold. After the war, they were interred in Changgouzhan, west of Yue Shi and Orange, on the Jiangyang Road north of Jiangwan Town, on more than nine mu of land owned by the Hall, named the January 28th Loyal Tomb. Subsequently, they raised funds to build a memorial arch and a monument, and embellished the area slightly to create a garden landscape. Currently, the monument, arch, and altar stone benches have been completed. However, the trees have not yet flourished, and pavilions and rockeries have not been fully arranged, so the unveiling will take some time. Since the fourth anniversary of the January 28th Incident has arrived, the Seventh District Party Headquarters has convened various organizations and agencies, and a public memorial service will be held at 10 AM today. A grand occasion is expected at that time.</p>

This is the purpose of organizing this association. Subsequently, we will follow this aim, work together, and develop Sino-Japanese trade.

<h3 id="e104">Ships Grounded Due to Shallow Yangtze River <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Hong Yuan: The Hong Yuan, a Changsha-class ship of the Sanbei Company, is now scheduled to transport goods into Hunan. However, the Guanyinzhou area below Changsha has the shallowest water. Ships with deeper drafts have been unable to navigate for a week. Goods have been transported by barges. Although the Hong Yuan has a shallow draft, it ran aground due to the sharp drop in the river level when it reached Guanyinzhou. Moreover, the hull of the ship is trapped in the shallows and cannot be moved. It has been five days so far and has not been rescued. Orders have been sent to Changsha to send a ship to barge the goods and to wait for the tide to rise for rescue.</p>
<p>Jiang Hua: The Jiang Hua, a state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ship, is a top-class ship on the Yangtze River. Last Thursday, it sailed from Shanghai to Hankou. On Sunday (the 26th), at around 6 PM, the ship ran aground just before reaching Hankou. The reason was the drop in the river level. The Hankou branch sent a tug to rescue it. After being grounded for seven hours, it was rescued at high tide and has now safely arrived in Hankou.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Salt Administration Levies Sulfur and Nitric Acid Taxes; Industrial Groups Oppose <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Sulfur and Nitric Acid Are Important Industrial Raw Materials; Domestic Foundations Not Solid; How Can They Bear the Burden of Heavy Taxes?</p>
<p>Sulfur and nitric acid are major raw materials for industry and have a significant impact on domestic goods factories. Since the Salt Administration's Nitrosulfur Department began levying taxes, various groups have repeatedly requested exemptions. Now it is learned that the Salt Administration's Nitrosulfur Department has not agreed to the exemptions. Local industrial groups have risen up in opposition and are very intense. A joint meeting of the relevant industries is scheduled to be held in the coming days to discuss effective countermeasures. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram to the Ministry: (Salutation Omitted) The Ministry of Finance's Salt Administration is levying extra taxes on sulfuric acid and nitric acid. We have repeatedly requested exemptions. These are important raw materials for the chemical industry. Customs duties have already been paid upon import, and all fees for passports and waybills have been paid. Additional levies should not be imposed to hinder the export of domestic goods. If this is true, we implore you to retract the order. The Shanghai Machinery Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association and the Enamel Industry Association humbly request. (Salutation Omitted) The Shanghai Machinery Dyeing and Weaving Association and others have telegraphed requesting exemption from the Salt Administration's Nitrosulfur Department's sulfuric acid and nitric acid taxes. Our association and others are in unanimous sympathy. We earnestly request that you have compassion for the difficulties of business and grant the request. We are endlessly grateful. The Shanghai Western Pigment Industry Association and the Chemical Raw Material Industry Association humbly request.</p>
<p>Calling a Meeting: The Shanghai Chemical Raw Material Industry Trade Association, in view of the fact that this matter concerns the entire chemical raw material industry, held a meeting the other day and discussed it. The consensus was that our country's industry is still in its infancy. The government is too busy to protect it, how can it add extra burdens? It was decided that in addition to import and export taxes and legal fees for passports and waybills, the extra taxes levied on sulfuric acid and nitric acid are unanimously opposed. It is reported that the relevant industries will hold a joint meeting in the coming days to discuss effective countermeasures.</p>
<p>Xie Xiaochu Speaks: A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency visited Xie Xiaochu, a member of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and General Manager of the Hua Feng Chemical Raw Material Company, yesterday afternoon. According to him, all sectors have indeed repeatedly fought against the collection of sulfuric acid and nitric acid taxes by the salt administration. Because this sulfuric acid and nitric acid are important raw materials for industry, only the Kaicheng and Tianli companies have been founded by Chinese merchants. The foundation has not yet been consolidated. It is hoped that the government will uphold the principle of assisting industry and exempting heavy taxes and miscellaneous levies, and exempt this extra levy. The board of directors of this company has appointed directors Lin Kanghou, Yu Zuoting, Du Yuesheng, Fang Yexian, Zhu Wenqi, and others to be responsible. The government attaches great importance to industry and will definitely comply with public opinion.</p>

<h3 id="e107">This City's Fresh Pork Industry to Suspend Weighing Scales for Three Days Today <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The final accounting showed great discrepancies, making it almost impossible to maintain operations. An emergency meeting decided to suspend weighing scales and discuss reorganization.</p>
<p>The Fresh Pork Industry Association of this city, due to the lack of rectification methods among its members during the year 24's final accounting period, resulting in significant discrepancies in account balances, decided at an emergency meeting the day before yesterday to suspend weighing scales for three days starting today to discuss and reorganize business operations. An urgent notice was issued yesterday, addressed to related industries such as pig vendors, slaughterhouses, and meat shops. The reporter from the China East News Agency specially investigated and recorded the reasons for the notice as follows: To Whom It May Concern, the member firms of this association, regarding the collection of accounts during this month's final accounting period, have found that the account balances are greatly disparate, making it almost impossible to maintain operations. To barely accommodate incoming goods and customers and to welcome the gods, weighing scales will be opened as usual on the 26th of this month. However, member firms still lack rectification methods. How can a foundation for business operations be established? Therefore, an emergency resolution was passed by all member firms to temporarily suspend weighing scales for three days starting from the 28th of this month to discuss and reorganize business operations, hoping for improvement. In addition to notifying through newspapers, this letter is sent for your information. Therefore, starting today, the entire city's concessions, non-concessions, Wusong, Pudong, and other areas will become a meatless world. It is also learned that slaughterhouses and other associations have prepared to petition the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Social Affairs Bureau, the Health Bureau, and other authorities to seek relief.</p>

<p>The public organizations and leaders of all circles in this city, in order to commemorate the soldiers and civilians who died in the "January 28th" Shanghai War, specially built a tomb at Jiangwan Temple with donations. The tomb was completed in December of last year. After the tomb's completion, it was originally intended to hold the completion ceremony on this year's January 28th Memorial Day (i.e., today). However, according to Mr. Lin Kanghou of the Construction Committee, speaking to the China East News Agency reporter yesterday, the preparations were not sufficient. Therefore, the completion ceremony cannot be held today and is generally rescheduled for February 20th. The procedures, etc., have now been transferred to the Municipal Government for handling.</p>

<p>The clearing number has been designated as "Yuan" number. Transactions between banks will be handled by three banks as agents for collection and payment.</p>
<p>The Central Bank's joining of the Shanghai Banking Association's Joint Reserve Committee clearing house, after several negotiations between the bank and the clearing house, has been completely agreed upon. It has been decided to officially participate in the clearing starting on the 28th of this month. The clearing number has been designated as "Yuan" number. According to the New News Agency reporter, starting from that date, all client accounts of the Joint Reserve Committee's clearing banks will be handled for collection and payment by the Central Bank, together with the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications as agents. Subsequently, the collection and payment of funds remitted between banks and money shops will be summarized and settled by the joint office of the Association's Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, together with the money shop reserve. However, because the Central Bank itself does not have remittances, the inflow and outflow of all clearing banks' remittances will continue to be handled directly by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications as agents.</p>

Branch companies are established in Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Shantou. Manager's offices are established in Ningbo, Shaoxing, Taizhou, Yuyao, and other places. Due to the impact of the economic downturn since July of last year, the company's cash flow was tight, and it was unable to pay its debts. The company then submitted a petition to the Jiangsu Shanghai First Special District Local Court, requesting composition. The court accepted the case, and at 2:00 PM yesterday, a creditors' meeting was held at the Zhengyi Society on the 7th floor of the Continental Department Store on Nanjing Road. The Datong News Agency reporter recorded the situation as follows:</p>

Finally, the proposed composition agreement was discussed. Those who agreed cast an "Agree" vote, and those who disagreed cast a "Disagree" vote. As a result, 65 entities cast "Agree" votes, representing a debt amount of 411,949.53 yuan, and only 4 entities cast "Disagree" votes, representing a debt amount of 5,454.41 yuan. The presiding body declared that the composition was legally established in accordance with Article 27 of the Bankruptcy Law and adjourned the meeting.

Party A shall, from future business operations, set aside three yuan of national currency for each box of cigarettes produced by the entire factory daily (including those entrusted to other factories or those entrusted by other factories to Party A), and repay it proportionally to the total amount of debt owed to Party B.

This calculation shall be carried out every six months. The remaining mortgage amount from Clause 1 of the article, and all other assets, except for the trademark rights which are subject to a separate agreement as collateral for Party B, shall be used as collateral for the debts of both Party B and Party C.

<p>American millionaire Mrs. Taylor chartered a ship to travel around the world. After arriving in Shanghai, Mrs. Taylor switched to trains and planes to tour the Yangtze River and Tianjin, spending more than ten thousand yuan on travel expenses and other uses in just a few days. Yesterday, Mrs. Taylor returned to Shanghai because the scheduled itinerary required her to go to other countries urgently, because the salary expenses of the sailors on her chartered ship are over 40,000 yuan per month, and the crew expenses for a year and a half are already over 700,000 yuan. All shipping formalities in Shanghai were handled by Butterfield &amp; Swire. Yesterday, the reporter heard that Mrs. Taylor had to leave Shanghai on the original ship at 2:00 PM, but upon rushing to visit, Mrs. Taylor had already disembarked and was preparing to set sail. It was not possible to inquire about the details of her sightseeing experience, which is a pity. It is only known that Mrs. Taylor has changed her original plan and does not want to go to Japan or Taiwan. Before leaving Shanghai, she ordered the shipowner to change course to Manila. After visiting the Philippines, she will return to the United States via the South Pacific. During Mrs. Taylor's visit to China this time, she purchased local products everywhere, and the food supplies needed on the ship were also purchased and replenished in Shanghai.</p>

<p>--The trial sentenced him to four months in prison--</p>
<p>At the Da Qian World Amusement Park on Rue de Notre Dame in the French Concession, at around 9:00 PM on the 25th, a tourist named Wang A'jin went to the cinema on the third floor. He asked a teahouse server named Zhang Tingwu to make a pot of tea. The regular price for fragrant tea at the park is two jiao of silver per pot. Because it was the Lunar New Year, the tourist Wang A'jin doubled the tea money and paid six jiao of silver to show generosity. However, the teahouse server Zhang Tingwu was not satisfied with the money and insisted on charging eight jiao of silver. Wang refused to pay, and the two began to argue. Zhang then forcibly snatched the pocket watch from Wang's body to compensate for the two jiao of tea money owed. Wang was unwilling to accept this and angrily left the park to report to the French Police Station for investigation. The police chief agreed and immediately dispatched a detective. The First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court was presided over by Judge. The Police Department lawyer, Gu Shouxi, explained the case and filed a lawsuit according to law. Then, the plaintiff Wang A'jin recounted the process of being forcibly extorted and robbed by the defendant. When questioned, the defendant Zhang Tingwu denied any wrongdoing. The court found that the defendant should have treated the tourist courteously and should not have used violence and coercion to force the tourist to do something they were not obligated to do. This kind of behavior is despicable, even worse than robbery. The defendant was reprimanded and then the debate was declared over. The defendant was sentenced to four months in prison in court. During the appeal period, he was allowed to provide a surety of 800 yuan to ensure his appearance when summoned. Without a surety, he would be detained in the detention center.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Zhang Xibiao Has No Connection to the Shooting of Chinese and Russian Detectives, The Police Department Investigated and Decided Not to Prosecute and Returned the Case to the First Special Court for Trial <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>At midnight on October 15, 1933, Liu Changrui, leader of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau's Detective Squad, led detectives, along with captured thief Chen Bingsheng, and together with French Concession detectives McDougall (transliteration) and Chinese detective Ji Zhixiang, went to No. 12 Hengqing Lane, Beile Road. A pistol was seized, and a shootout occurred with the bandits. Western detective McDougall and Gong Kongxiang, a detective from the Municipal Police Bureau, were killed. As a result, a thief from Shaoxing, Wu Yaoting, was arrested and sent to the Second Special District Court. After interrogation, he was sentenced to life imprisonment. At that time, Wu testified that the shooting was carried out by the fugitive Zhang Xibiao, who was resisting arrest. The French Concession Police petitioned the Second Special Court to issue an arrest warrant for Zhang Xibiao. However, Zhang escaped and remained at large for more than two years. Until recently, the Public Concession Police arrested Zhang. The French Concession Police learned of this, reported it to the Second Special Court, and prepared a document to transfer Zhang to the First Special Court for interrogation and investigation, as detailed in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that during the investigation, the French Police Department transferred Wu Yaoting, the thief who had already been sentenced to life imprisonment, from the Second Special Prison to the case for strict interrogation. He was ordered to confront Zhang. As a result, it was believed that there was no active evidence of Zhang's crime. Yesterday morning, when Judge Xiong Cui of the Second Special Court came to the First Criminal Court to order Zhang to be brought to court for further trial, Gu Shouxi, a lawyer from the Police Department, told the court that the Police Department had investigated the case and there was no evidence of the defendant's crime, so he would not be prosecuted. The court verified the report, briefly questioned Zhang about his name, age, and place of origin, and then ruled in court that Zhang Xibiao should still be sent back to the First Special District Local Court for trial.

<p>Yang Wenlin, a native of Hubei, 32 years old, served as a police officer at the Jiangwan Police Station. He was diligent in his daily work. Recently, he was ordered to be transferred to the North Station Branch for service. Two days ago, no one knows what he was touched by, so at 7:00 PM, he suddenly went to the Baofa Hotel on Baoshan Road, and opened a room at Room 20 on the third floor, and went to sleep in the deep night. Yesterday morning, the waiter called and did not respond, so he became suspicious, informed the front desk, and opened the door to enter. He saw Yang Wenlin lying on his back on the bed, already dead. His lips and fingers were blue-purple, presumably due to poisoning. He then reported to the North Station Branch, ordering the Baojia Zhang Liugen to report to the local court and ask for an autopsy. In the afternoon, Prosecutor Ouyang Shu and Examiner Shen came to the scene to perform an autopsy.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Nanshi District Rent Reduction Committee, in view of the many rental disputes in this city, has since its establishment repeatedly submitted petitions to the National Government Military Commission, the Executive Yuan, and the municipal party and government organs and various courts. It is now learned that the Executive Yuan has decided to draft a mediation for rent disputes in Beijing and Shanghai. The association yesterday specifically submitted a full copy of the draft for promulgation. The original submission is recorded as follows: "Submitted for the purpose of petitioning for the promulgation of the draft for mediation of rent disputes in Beijing and Shanghai passed by your esteemed Yuan for reference, so that there may be compliance and benefit the people's affairs. The association, in response to factual needs, has established the Shanghai Nanshi District Rent Reduction Committee, receiving leadership from the party and government and love from the citizens, working tirelessly day and night. Its purpose is pure, its measures peaceful, and its progress has been two years. Details have long been observed by your esteemed Yuan. Therefore, various alleys, lanes, and merchants unable to bear the burden of high rents have organized rent reduction branches, which have become widespread throughout the city, indicating the depression of the city and the decline in land value. Rent reduction is an urgent task to save the city's appearance. Under the righteous and sincere mediation, the end of rent reduction is heard of every day. However, if there is no draft for mediation to abide by in the future when the interests of tenants and landlords conflict, it is not a permanent solution to end labor disputes. Your esteemed Yuan is the administrative hub of the country, and no place that benefits the country and the people is not planned in detail. Therefore, we specifically petition for the promulgation of the full copy of the draft for mediation of rent disputes in Beijing and Shanghai that has been passed by your esteemed Yuan, so that there may be compliance and benefit the people's transportation. It is truly a public convenience. Respectfully submitted."</p>

The bureau has submitted a request to the Central People's Training Committee and the Ministry of Transportation to send personnel to Shanghai to handle the matter. The People's Training Committee has sent Wu Shaozhu, Director of the Training Department, and the Ministry of Transportation has also sent Ren Jizhong, Section Chief, who arrived in Shanghai on the 24th to convene the various teahouses and conduct mediation.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Military Affairs believes that charcoal vehicles are important for national defense transportation, so the Transportation Corps held a charcoal vehicle test. The vehicles tested were a Chevrolet truck manufactured by the Zhongming Factory, with a load capacity of 1.5 tons, a Lihe Dauntless passenger car manufactured by the China Machinery Factory in Hankou, with a load capacity of 1.5 tons, and a General Motors truck manufactured by the China Corporation, with a load capacity of 3 tons. The chief examiners were German consultant Roman, technician Shen Yunshan, Peng Hao, Hu Zongpu, and several others. Initially, they drove from Nanjing to Shanghai, but there were some failures due to the snowy weather along the way. On the 19th of this month, they officially started the comparison drive, driving from Shanghai to Hangzhou. The results were Zhongming first, China second, and China third. The difference between first and third place was 1.03 points. On the 20th, they drove from Hangzhou to Huzhou, and the results were the same. On the 21st, they drove from Huzhou back to Nanjing, and Zhongming was still first, China rose to second place, and China was third. Also, during the test in Huzhou, the Zhongming's fire-up procedure took only five minutes, while the others were slightly slower. On average, the Zhongming vehicle traveled 45 yards on flat ground and 56 yards downhill, which is better than or equal to gasoline vehicles. The fact that both decisions were first place is no coincidence. Therefore, after arriving in Beijing, it was extremely welcomed by military and political circles. That evening, Shao Hua, Li Sicong, Li Mengsheng, Wang Yongbin, Tian Jiongjin, Jiao Yitang, Zheng Zhenyu, Li Kending, Zhou Bomin, Luo Gang, Wang Luyi, Liu Zhiping, Wang Guangqing, Wu Hantao, Zhao Guanwu, Zheng Luosheng, Zhang Guangxun, Liu Eqing, and others hosted a banquet to celebrate. Tang Zhongming, the inventor of the charcoal vehicle, and Fan Zhengbo, general manager of the Zhongming Factory, attended and reported, making it a grand occasion. The Transportation Corps has also submitted the results to the Ministry of Military Affairs.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Youth Association believes that the scenery of Sichuan is superior to other places in the country, and the climate is mild, making it a natural tourist area. In the past, due to inconvenient transportation, there was a feeling that "the road to Sichuan is harder than ascending to heaven." Therefore, many people in Jiangnan could not travel there to their heart's content. Recently, transportation in Sichuan Province has become increasingly convenient, and the internal order has also been improved, so the number of tourists has increased. The association is planning to launch a Sichuan trip, scheduled for mid-April, when the weather is pleasant. Preparations are currently underway. Any members interested in participating can contact Mr. Song Fuhua, a staff member of the association's Membership Department.</p>

<p>Cao Chunsheng, a 17-year-old apprentice from Changzhou at the Meiwen Printing Shop, No. 622 Nanjing Road, spent one yuan last November and bought a strip of 18th-period aviation lottery tickets from the Fulai Ticket Shop next door at No. 623. The number was "234475". After the lottery draw, he learned that he could win one yuan for matching the last digit of the top prize. He then found a strip of discarded tickets that didn't win anything, cut out the number "7", and pasted it over the hundreds digit "4" on his purchased ticket, making it "234775", which matched the number of the sixth prize drawn in that period. Intending to fraudulently claim the prize money of ten yuan, on the 13th of this month, he took the ticket to Dachangcheng Cigarette and Paper Shop, No. 120 Huangpu Bund, French Concession, which also sold lottery tickets, to redeem the prize money. He was discovered by the shop owner, Gao Zengbao, who detained Cao and the ticket and notified Detective Yao Zhupo and the police, who arrested Cao and took him to the police station and sent him to the Second Special District Court. The police lawyer filed a public prosecution for the crime of altering valuable securities. The circumstances have been reported in previous newspapers. The case has now been concluded after trial by Judge Wang Gangxu of the Second Special District Court. Yesterday, Judge Wang presided over the First Criminal Division and sentenced Cao Chunsheng to ten months of imprisonment, suspended for three years, for altering valuable securities with the intention of providing them for use. During the probation period, he was to be placed under the supervision of his master, Zhang Ziliang. The altered 18th-period aviation lottery ticket was confiscated.</p>

<h3 id="e134">Another Depositor Sues Wuhua Branch Bank, Liquidation Unfinished Two Years After Collapse, Creditor Files Fraud Lawsuit <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The head office of Wuhua Bank was originally located in Hong Kong. In October 1933, it opened a branch in Ningbo Road, Shanghai, with a registered capital of 500,000 yuan, half of which was allocated by the head office. The remaining 250,000 yuan was to be raised by the branch's manager and deputy manager, Fan Shaoliang and Ye Haitian. A council of advisors was also established to guide the bank's operations, consisting of 15 members, with Tang Shoumin and Chen Bingqian as the chairmen of the council. Later, in the summer of the following year, a branch was established in the French Concession's Eight Immortals Bridge area. Ten-year and five-year plans were devised and promoted in newspapers, and deposits were attracted with high interest rates. Therefore, at the beginning of its operation,</p>
<p>There were many depositors and business flourished. Later, the head office, due to financial difficulties, successively withdrew 220,000 yuan from the branch, which caused the branch to feel empty inside. The branch also ran out of funds, and both the branch and sub-branch collapsed simultaneously in August 1934, while the head office was not affected in the slightest and remained strong. However, after the head office received news of the closure of the branch and sub-branch, it sent personnel to Shanghai to handle the liquidation. However, the branch had already started the liquidation process, so a dispute arose between the two parties over the right to liquidate. After a long war of words, a joint liquidation method was decided upon through mediation, and the dispute subsided. However,</p>
<p>Nearly two years have passed since the collapse, and the liquidation is only in name, and the creditors have received nothing. Therefore, a large number of depositors have already filed criminal lawsuits with the Second Special District Court against Tang Shoumin and Chen Bingqian, the chairmen of the council, and Fan Shaoliang, Ye Haitian, Wang Jian'e, and Wu Yousan, the manager and deputy manager of the branch and sub-branch, for fraud. The initial trial has concluded, and Tang, Chen, and others have been fined. However, because neither party was satisfied, the case is currently on appeal in the Third High Court, and it will take some time to reach a final determination. Now, Dehe Aomiaoji Company and Gu Shide, Ma Yimin, and others, who were depositors of the sub-branch, because the money they deposited after the opening of the sub-branch in 1934, totaling</p>
<p>More than 9,000 yuan, has all been defaulted on and there has been no indication of repayment, so they have also filed a lawsuit against the four manager, deputy managers, Fan, Ye, Wang, and Wu, Chairman Chen Bingqian and Council member Cui Pingxi for fraud in the First Special District Court, outlining the various deceptive practices used to attract depositors, such as using famous people and tempting them with high interest rates. They also cited the resolution of the financial conference convened by the Ministry of Finance in June 1935, which stated that banks and money shops that have suspended operations should be liquidated within three months, and shareholders, supervisors, and managers should be responsible for the speedy liquidation. They stated that not only are the defendants undeniably responsible, but the head office cannot</p>
<p>Remain indifferent and requested that they be punished according to the law. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Risheng of the First Special District Court opened the court for a hearing. The plaintiffs who attended were Kong Zhongqi and Xiong Decheng, managers of Dehexing, who were Cantonese, and Gu Shide and Ma Yimin. Only Wang Jian'e, one of the defendants, surrendered. Chen Bingqian hired lawyer Yang Guoshu, and Cui Pingxi hired lawyer Wang Fuchang to defend them. First, Kong Zhongqi presented deposit slips to prove that Dehexing deposited 5,000 yuan in the Wuhua sub-branch. Then, Gu and Ma each proved the amount of their deposits. When questioned, the defendant Wang Jian'e admitted that he was the manager of the sub-branch and claimed that the sub-branch was under the</p>
<p>Control of the branch, so he had no right to intervene in how the liquidation was handled. He also felt that the current liquidation process was being delayed and that the interests of the creditors were not being taken into account, which he was very dissatisfied with. He also described in detail the establishment of the Wuhua sub-branch. The court then inquired about the addresses of the defendants who could not be summoned. According to Wang's answer, he knew that Fan Shaoliang currently lived at No. 40 Huayuanfang, French Concession, and Ye Haitian was the manager of the Guohua Bank in Tianjin. Judge Huang then adjourned the hearing until the afternoon of February 17.</p>

<p>Jianghai Customs issued Joint Announcement No. 1495 to announce that it had been ordered to revise the regulations on restricting the import of hunting rifles and bullets. The announcement stated that the Customs had previously revised the regulations on restricting the import of hunting rifles and bullets by foreign merchants in various places in Section 2 of Article 5, Chapter 21 of the Revised Compilation of Customs Laws and Regulations in 1935, which stipulated that "the total number of various hunting bullets that each business may import each time shall not exceed 10,000 rounds. If this number is insufficient for sales, they may be allowed to store up to 25,000 rounds of various hunting bullets, but the guarantee provided by the business shall state that the number sold to each buyer shall be limited to 4,000 rounds." Now, in accordance with the order of the Ministry of Finance, the aforementioned regulations should be cancelled. In the future, foreign merchants in various places may import no more than four, or at most six, hunting rifles and no more than 10,000 rounds of bullets. However, reputable businesses in Shanghai should still be allowed to store up to 25 hunting rifles and 25,000 rounds of bullets in military and fireproof warehouses in accordance with current regulations (of which, no more than four hunting rifles and no more than 4,000 rounds of bullets may be imported each time). All foreign merchants should be informed of this. Special announcement. Supervisor Tang Haian. Tax Officer Baronson.</p>

<p>Smallpox is a major enemy of mankind, and countless people die from it every year. More than 60 years ago, before vaccination became popular in our country, the old method was mostly used.

The 26th of this month is the 103rd anniversary of the death of E. Jenner, the Englishman who discovered vaccination. We cannot but pay our respects to this great scientist who has contributed to mankind. Furthermore, the Municipal Health Bureau and the Health Department of the Public Works Department, in order to prevent the spread of smallpox and chickenpox due to the mild weather, have now begun preparations for universal vaccination.</p>

Jiang, because he was at his wife's home at the time, and it was also the beginning of the lunar new year, could not retaliate, so he returned home alone, feeling unhappy, increasingly annoyed, and increasingly angry, unable to speak. At 10:30 PM, Jiang actually took his pistol and committed suicide by shooting himself, the bullet entering from the side of his right chest and piercing through his back. He immediately fell to the ground unconscious. By the time people in the regiment heard the sound and rushed over, Jiang was unable to speak. He was immediately taken to the Red Cross Hospital by car. After examination by the doctor, because the injury was in a vital area, his life was in danger.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Electrical Machinery and Silk Weaving Trade Association, in view of the fact that the industry had a credit transaction system in the past when the money market was loose and the market was booming. However, with the market downturn, the money industry has tightened its lending, resulting in tight money. For accounts that have already been extended, they cannot be collected at any time, and all capital goods have become stagnant on the books, falling into the predicament of inflexible turnover. To seek self-preservation, the association convened the 11th executive and supervisory meeting and resolved that, after the closing of accounts for the 24th year and starting from the business opening of the 25th year, all customers who purchase goods in batches must implement the following two methods: commercial acceptance drafts and cash transactions. The old-fashioned credit method without bills will no longer be applicable in order to increase the bargaining chip and facilitate turnover. The benefits of commercial acceptance drafts have long been repeatedly explained and implemented by major groups such as the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and all sectors feel the convenience and effectiveness. The association has also been implementing it for a long time. Although the old-fashioned credit system that does not conform to modern commerce is now abolished, the implementation of commercial acceptance drafts still allows customers to pay in installments as agreed, which is tantamount to still being a credit nature, and also implies the meaning of production and sales cooperation. It is heard that the industry has notified the industry to implement it uniformly starting from today.</p>

<p>The owner of the Russian bakery, Baikiliang (transliteration), located at No. 2346 Albert Road in the French Concession, was 48 years old. Because the Russian employee in the shop, Miyano夫 (transliteration), was 30 years old, had indecent and obscene behavior towards his two young daughters, aged nine and six, he was informed by his wife on November 26th of last year. At 2:00 PM that afternoon, he summoned 　to the third floor for questioning. Sai fully admitted and replied that he was only teasing and had no intention of rape. Bai was unable to vent his anger for a moment, so he killed Sai with a knife and then surrendered himself to the French patrol. After investigation by the French Police Department, he was sent to the Second Special Court and prosecuted for murder. At the end of the trial, Bai Qiliang was sentenced to 12 years of imprisonment. Bai refused to accept the judgment and hired lawyers Zhan Jifeng and others to appeal to the High Third Court. The French Police Department, in view of the comments from various Western newspapers in Shanghai that the defendant killed out of temporary impulse and that, according to Western legal precedents, he could be acquitted, felt that the original trial and sentencing were too heavy and also filed an appeal with the High Third Court, requesting a discretionary reduction of the sentence for the defendant. The High Third Court held a collegial panel to hear the case on the 14th of this month and announced the end of the debate, scheduling the announcement of the judgment, which has been reported in the previous newspaper. The High Third Court has now announced the judgment, revoking the original judgment and reducing the sentence to eight years of imprisonment. It is rumored that the appellant Bai Qiliang is still dissatisfied with the appeal judgment and plans to file a third instance appeal, hoping to be acquitted or given a suspended sentence. However, according to Chinese law, murderers can hardly escape legal sanctions.</p>

<p>Gong Wutai's Third Episode of the Red Lotus Temple is a Great Success Because the Gong Wutai on Aiduya Road spent a lot of money and hired experts to work on the scenery and plot of the Fire Burning Red Lotus Temple, the first two episodes had already shocked the entire Shanghai when they were performed. For the opening of the new year, the newly arranged third episode was replaced. The mysterious mechanism scenery used was obtained from the magic secrets of Deng Tuo, Jifuluo, and other great magicians. It is mysterious and unpredictable, making it unpredictable. It is still a novelty to use such a great magic scenery on the Chinese stage. Therefore, since the premiere, the number of people from all walks of life who have come to watch it has been like a tide. The traffic on Aiduya Road has been cut off several times. Yesterday, the iron gate of the stage was broken through by the audience. Therefore, starting today, the scattered seat tickets will be sold in the cigarette paper shop at the entrance to avoid crowding.</p>

<h3 id="e162">Basketball Preliminary Election Last Night Nanjing Lost to North China by One Point Result: 47 to 46 Nanjing Led by Eleven Points in the First Half <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>The third night of the Arinbique basketball preliminary election. Last night's result between Nanjing and North China was that North China won Nanjing by one point. The score was 47 to 46. In the first half, Nanjing led North China by 27 to 16. After Zhao Zhihua was sent off in the first half, Nanjing's entire line fell into collapse and chaos in the second half. It was fortunate to lose by only one point. As for the excitement, there was not much moving performance except for some long shots.</p>
<p>Nanjing Was Very Prosperous for a While At the beginning of the game, North China took the lead with the Beijing team, but it was completely different from Nanjing's team. Nanjing trampled on it at will, without any ability to fight back. After Wang Shixuan opened the record first, Bao Wenpei built great achievements one after another, scoring again and again, and actually created a score of 10 to 0. At this point, North China only opened the record, but the gains were limited. Wang Yuzeng also entered and exited the basket, and the score became 22 to 8.</p>
<p>The Tianjin Team Took to the Field The Tianjin team could no longer sit idly by and changed its entire army. Nanjing's offensive suddenly decreased. Xu Zhaoxiong, Shen Yu Gong, and Liu Baocheng also entered the basket one after another. The result of the first half was 27 to 16. The score was slightly closer. However, when the score was 23 to 10, Zhao Zhihua, the main defender of Nanjing, was sent off, and Xiao Baoyuan was unable to continue his career. It was a fatal injury to Nanjing.</p>
<p>North China Exceeded for the Second Time In the second half, the Tianjin team launched a major offensive, winning five goals in a row. The momentum was terrible, and it was only behind by one point with a score of 26 to 27. The Jing team had difficulty moving. Wang Yuzeng waved his hand casually and only scored with a long shot. Shen Liu Erfeng scored two more goals, and North China suddenly exceeded the score for the second time with 30 to 29.</p>
<p>A Pityful Loss by One Point Wang Yuzeng's second long shot, although successful, North China saw a straight rise again, leading by eight points. The formation of the Jing team was scattered and unable to restrain it. It completely relied on individual combat and long shots to advance. The score was 42 to 34. Li Shaotang of North China was sent off, and Yin Meiwu was sent off at 44 to 38. The danger of North China appeared again. Bao Wenpei of the Jing team changed to attacking from the middle and scored two goals in a row. The score became 47 to 46, only one point behind, but the game had already ended. The Jing team lost regretfully.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Field Was Muddy, 4 to 2 Hong Kong and Shanghai Western Union Won Korea Korean Team Members Ran Quickly, Were Brave, and Fought Well <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>The Hong Kong and Shanghai Western Union team and the Korean team had a friendly match in Shenyuan at 3:00 PM yesterday. There were 4,000 to 5,000 spectators. However, the muddy field affected the strength of both teams a lot. The Korean team members ran quickly, fought hard for the ball, and their brave spirit was unmatched by other teams. However, their passing was inaccurate, and they often missed the opportunity, or they were too weak to kick, or they fell before kicking, otherwise they would not have failed. The goalkeeper was short, lacked skills, and his position was inappropriate. He lost two goals first, and the goalkeeper could not escape the blame. The right defender Zheng Longzhu was tall and fought well, and seemed to be a notch higher than the right defender Hong Shengen. The center defender line was also barely satisfactory. The front record was best with Jin Chenghan. The two were less active, so the attack focused on the middle road, so it was more difficult to succeed. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Western Union team were all elite players. The defender Paiershiwen, the midfielders Bartu考斯坦雷米狄, were as solid as iron walls, and their guard was firm. However, when they encountered the brave and energetic Korean team, they also sometimes found themselves at a loss.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong and Shanghai Team Seized the Initiative</p>
<p>At 3:00 PM, the referee Bei Neng blew the whistle to start the game. The Korean team kicked off against the sunlight. The Hong Kong and Shanghai team intercepted the attack and attacked first. In less than four minutes, Howie passed the ball to Herr, who dribbled to the front of the goal and shot hard. Tuoba waited for the right move, jumped up and headed the ball, and the ball went into the net, opening the record first. The Korean team, seeing the situation was not good, quickly tried to counterattack. Jin Chenghan led the three armies and approached the enemy's goal. Pai'er accidentally fouled, and a free kick was awarded outside the 20-yard line. Fortunately, Shiwen topped the ball, turning danger into safety. Before long, Bartu fouled again, and Jin Chenghan raised his foot to shoot, but unfortunately, it slanted out of the goal and failed to score again. With the good opportunity missed, bad luck came suddenly. Kaositan joined forces and Bifu passed the ball in with one kick. Tuoba lightly fired the ball again and scored again. After that, they came and went, but there were no achievements. The first half ended with a score of two to zero.</p>
<p>The Korean Team Had a Revival Once</p>
<p>After the lemonade, the Korean team tried to avenge their shame, and the situation was very strong. The five tiger generals attacked around the goal, and the front of the Hong Kong and Shanghai team's goal was all Korean territory. There was a mixed battle at times. Unfortunately, both shots were caught and held by Basai Zhong. The Korean team members rushed wildly to no avail, and many people rolled into a ball. The whistle blew to start the game, Howie dribbled the ball alone and went deep. Zheng Longzhu failed to block him. Howie shot from outside the 20-yard line and scored, creating a score of three to zero. The Korean team refused to be outdone, and everyone tried desperately. Jin Chenghan also imitated Howie's old trick, rode alone and went straight in. Basai Zhong rushed out to meet him, but it was too late. Jin Chenghan raised his foot and shot, and the ball went into the net, breaking the egg. The audience cheered loudly. In less than two minutes, the left wing Han Jiaxi shot another goal, and the momentum was great. The connection between the five forwards also turned better, making it impossible for the Hong Kong and Shanghai team to resist. The ball could not cross the midline. This was the most prosperous era of the Korean team. Unfortunately, the shooting was chaotic and turned into baseball, so the great opportunity was easily missed. Heaven does not bless people, what can be done? After passing the difficult situation, the Hong Kong and Shanghai team showed their strength again. Kaositan responded in the middle, and Fuenherr took advantage of the situation to counterattack. The Korean team's defense was empty, and Tuoba was rampant again, shooting another goal in the left corner, making the score four to two. Although the Korean team tried to recover, the time was not with them. The referee's long whistle sounded and the game ended. The lineups of both sides are as follows:</p>

<p>All members of the China Science Society in this city held a celebration for Cai Yuanpei, director and trustee of the society's foundation, at the International Recreation Club on Bubbling Well Road. Over two hundred people attended. Ma Junwu delivered a speech, stating that seventy years old is the perfect time to do things, like the great German hero Bismarck, who reformed politics at the age of seventy. Therefore, he hoped that Mr. Cai would not consider himself old, lead the people, and work hard to save the country. Cai then gave a reply, saying that seventy years old is just living a few more years. One hundred and twenty years old is considered a long life, and eighty years old is considered a short life. I am only seventy this year, so I can't really call it a long life. However, I am very willing to accept Mr. Ma's request that I not consider myself old and work hard to save the country. He then gave a detailed account of his life's experiences. After Cai's speech, there were additional performances, including an ensemble by the China Harmonica Society, a song by Mr. Chen Nengfang, a violin solo by Miss Liao Yongkang, and a piano solo by the internationally renowned seventeen-year-old Russian musical prodigy, Xivas.

<p>Dr. Wang Tiecheng, the principal of the Continental English School on Avenue Edward VII, spares no effort in cultivating English talents. Many graduates have gone on to serve in various fields and hold excellent positions. Last summer, he broadcast English lessons over the radio, causing a sensation throughout Shanghai, with over eight thousand listeners. It was hailed as a great method for popularizing education. Dr. Wang Tiecheng recently observed that although many English learners have considerable opportunities, they still struggle to get started and find it difficult to make progress. This is due to both the students' lack of effort and the inability to improve teaching methods. Therefore, during the winter break, he devoted himself to studying the latest English teaching methods in the world, drawing on his years of teaching experience and focusing on research interest and practical materials. He also incorporated the Dalton Plan, paying attention to individual instruction, so that students can develop their listening, reading, and writing skills simultaneously according to their individual personalities. His aim is to enable students, regardless of their talent, to achieve results in the shortest possible time, learning one word and being able to write one word, learning one sentence and being able to use one sentence. It is said that Dr. Wang Tiecheng personally teaches important courses at all levels, abandoning mechanical and outdated teaching methods and utilizing new teaching methods, which will surely enable students to achieve twice the results with half the effort.</p>

<p>Mingde Girls' Vocational Middle School</p>
<p>The Mingde Girls' Vocational Middle School on Huajin Road in the city has achieved excellent results. There have been many new students registering this semester, mostly graduates from well-known municipal elementary schools. It is expected that one class will not be able to accommodate everyone, so the school's administrative council has decided to divide it into two classrooms, following the example of the second year of middle school, and adopt a dual-track system to popularize vocational education. All grades in the elementary school are overcrowded. In addition to the fourth grade, which has already adopted a dual-track system and been divided into two classrooms, the other grades are also planning to be divided into two classrooms each, with the aim of popularizing primary education by limiting the number of students in each class. It is said that the school focuses on subjects such as typing and bookkeeping in order to train talents for the business world.</p>

In response to the request of the families of deaf and mute students, a few more students have been specially admitted, and poor students are still being recruited. It is said that the school is scheduled to start on January 6th, and registration will close soon.</p>

<p>On January 20th, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was on its last day before the Lunar New Year holiday, and also the day before the last day of futures trading for January. After this, there would be a week-long holiday, with trading not resuming until January 28th (the fifth day of the Lunar New Year). Therefore, trading on the 20th was still very active, mostly due to swaps and liquidations by both parties. However, market prices were unbelievably chaotic and irregular. On the surface, most of the activity seemed to be short-covering swaps, with traders willing to accept losses on lower prices in the distant months in order to maintain their original short positions. Market prices rose due to short squeezes, which were also linked to the issue of interest rate cuts. There were also rumors of improved conditions in the market, with some saying that due to opposition from the financial community, the cuts would not be implemented immediately, while others claimed that the long and short sides had already settled over ten million off the exchange. Regardless of the actual outcome of the interest rate cut issue, the volume of trading in the distant months exceeded that of the near months by three or four times, and the price difference was even more significant. The price difference for the whole-six contract was as much as 3.4 yuan, which shows that there were still very active short positions in the distant months. If it were not for some of the short-covering swaps, market prices would have fallen sharply. Therefore, there will definitely be major changes when the market reopens after the New Year holiday. On the 20th, trading was still only done in two sessions. In the first session, the current month's 20-roll contract rose sharply by more than 2 yuan, while only the 20-Guanjin short contracts showed a small decrease of 0.1-0.2 yuan in the near months, with sell prices at 33.35, 33.43, and 33.46, and buy prices at 33.20, 33.34, 33.71, and 33.78. The remaining retail trades showed a continued increase of about 1 yuan for both the 9th Good and the 20-roll contracts. The unified tax 23-Guanjin contract was down by 0.3 or 0.6 yuan, which was already absurd. The whole-six near contract rose by 0.3 yuan, while the distant contract fell by more than 1.5 yuan due to the short-covering swap of the 5th contract, and large sales from contracts 43 and 54. The lack of confidence was evident. The final result of the day's market prices was that most contracts rose by 0.3 to 0.5 yuan, up to a maximum of 3.2 yuan, while the near month unified tax contract fell by 0.25 yuan, and the distant month whole-six contract fell by 1.3 yuan. As the reopening of the market after the New Year approaches, the focus of price fluctuations will still be on whether or not the interest rate cut issue is implemented. The total transaction volume was 42.5 million, with distant month contracts accounting for over 30.04 million. The resulting increases and decreases are listed in the table below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>Report from New Fung Foreign Firm (25th): New York stock prices rose, led by the rebound of public utility stocks near the closing. However, the market opened slightly lower due to selling from Europe. Although speculators in this country believe that the higher margin requirements are beneficial to the long side, Europe considers it beneficial to the short side. Rumors circulated throughout the week that the Federal Reserve Board had foreknowledge of certain fundamental changes in the US monetary system. The short side then rushed to cover their positions due to fears that margin requirements might have been increased. Small exchange stocks were firm, and the bond market was mixed.

<p>(1) Overview of Standard Cotton</p>
<p>The condition of standard cotton in the 24th year was turbulent, with wide fluctuations and surprising changes. The first half of the year saw new lows since the exchange was established, with the June contract reaching 30.03 yuan. The second half of the year saw new highs since the abolition of the tael and the adoption of the yuan, with the May contract reaching 46.03 yuan on December 4th. The difference between the high and low was a staggering 16 yuan, which was alarming. The year's process and productivity are described below. At the beginning of the year, the banking sector's hoarding movement was unusually strong. The financial sector ceased lending and discounting for cotton, and cotton merchants were contacted to form cooperatives for large-scale stockpiling. The market sentiment at this time reached fever pitch, standing above 38 yuan at the end of the lunar year. As the winter vacation approached, closures became more serious, and the pressure on credit reached its extreme. During February, March, and April, spring yarn sales were again disappointing, and market prices trended downwards, making it even harder for the interdependent cotton market to stand its ground. The price fell in a straight line from 38 yuan to 34 yuan. During this sluggish period, the US recovery plan was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, and US cotton fell sharply from 12.5 cents to 11.0 cents, a drop of more than 100 pounds. The world cotton industry was shaken, and our country's cotton market was also in a precarious situation. As for the cotton stockpiled by the banking sector, it was continuously shipped to Shanghai, causing the cotton stored in the local warehouses to exceed one million dan. The Lingbao cotton alone accounted for 110,000 to 120,000 bales (each bale weighing 500 pounds). Moreover, the inventory along the Northwest route was congested, and Shanghai's credit situation remained unresolved. As a result, the market price fell into a state of permanent depression. During June and July, the June standard flower contract almost broke the 30 yuan mark, with the lowest price being 30.03 yuan. Later, some cotton merchants, believing that the decline in US cotton had gradually stabilized and that the price was at a new low unseen in more than a decade, became significantly active in taking long positions. The standard gold rose at one point, and the clamor for currency inflation soared. After a two-yuan increase, the price hovered around 33 yuan for a long time. In reality, yarn factories were hit by poor market conditions, yarn prices did not rise, business was difficult, and shutdowns and layoffs were common. The market price wanted to rise but stopped. Subsequently, in August and September, the US cotton agricultural loan was changed from 12 cents to 9 cents, and the market was unstable for a while. Oriental cotton yarn was also dragged into a state of exhaustion. Unexpectedly, severe floods occurred in northern China, and the cotton fields in Hubei were submerged, expanding the scope of the disaster. Hubei Province suffered particularly heavy damage, attracting speculative traders to absorb the supply, leading to a reversal of fortunes. The market's rising momentum was hidden, shifting from a low point to a high level. During October and November, the Italo-Ethiopian dispute led to the concentration of the British Navy in the Mediterranean, and the atmosphere of war was intense. Overseas US cotton, Oriental Three Products cotton, Indian cotton, and Liverpool cotton all rose in unison. Rumors of soaring standard gold prices and a strong inflationary atmosphere spread. Standard gold broke through the 1,200 yuan mark, and the financial sector and outsiders flocked in, regardless of the market price, blindly buying. From 33.04 yuan, the price jumped in a straight line to above 40 yuan. Subsequently, with the currency system reform, which went from rumor to reality, the National Government officially announced the legal tender on November 4th. Yarn flower speculation became even more excited. Gold shops and securities firms worked hard to buy, and the market felt a great shortage of chips. Tongji alone bought 70,000 dan, and Xincheng American Merchants also bought 30,000 to 40,000 dan. Changhe Japanese Merchants also reached 40,000 to 50,000 dan. Buyers were concentrated, and whenever good news spread, the price jumped by three yuan in one day. Later, due to competition among large accounts, there were fluctuations at one point. During November and December, our country's cotton production continued to decline. The first production report was 9,596,684 dan, and the second production report was 8,391,018 dan, a decrease of 1,205,667 dan. The final revised estimate was 8,197,688 dan, a further decrease of 193,333 dan. Compared to last year's final revised estimate of 11,200,199 dan, there was a sharp decrease of 3,004,311 dan. According to this statistical situation, the reduction in production made it difficult to see prices falling. Therefore, foreign merchants adopted a "buy on dips" strategy. On December 4th, the peak reached 46.03 yuan, setting a new record in recent years. Subsequently, with the sharp contraction of overseas silver and the gold market also showing signs of hesitation, the US Supreme Court ruled the Agricultural Adjustment Act unconstitutional. US cotton market prices were unstable, and confidence was dampened. The market price fell back. The closing price on January 18th was 41.8 yuan for the near term and 44 yuan for the far term, an increase of 5.2 yuan to 5.65 yuan compared to the closing price at the end of the 23rd year, which was 36.6 yuan to 38.35 yuan. The total transaction volume of standard flowers for the whole year was 27,024,400 dan, a decrease of 5,670,300 dan compared to the 32,694,700 dan in the 23rd year. Among them, the November contract had the highest transaction volume, totaling 891,200 dan. The highest settlement price for the whole year was 41.5 yuan for the December contract, and the lowest was 31.5 yuan for the June contract. The number of settlement bales for the whole year was 300,360 dan, with the highest being 90,600 dan in December and the lowest being 5,400 dan in June. The highest price for standard flowers was 43 yuan for the December contract, and the lowest was 30.03 yuan for the June contract. The high and low settlement prices of standard flowers for each month of the 24th year, as well as the settlement volume and total transaction volume, are listed below.</p>
<p>Note: The high and low prices of standard flowers for each month above are calculated according to the value of each market dan in national currency. In the 23rd year, it was calculated in old system dan in national currency. The standard flower for the September contract is not open for auction during the period between the old and new crops as a rule.</p>
<p>(2) Spot Cotton Transactions</p>
<p>The number of raw cotton purchased by Shanghai yarn factories last year was recorded and statistically analyzed in the local market. The total transaction volume of white-packed cotton for the whole year was 266,478 bales, a decrease of 14,602 bales compared to the 281,080 bales in the previous year. The number of foreign frames was 157,634 pieces, an increase of 24,977 pieces compared to the 132,657 pieces in the previous year. The reason for the increase was said to be the tightening of domestic finance, which reduced the purchase of foreign cotton, and domestic cotton needed to be used as a substitute. In fact, the consumption of various factories has decreased. During June, July, and August, yarn prices did not rise, and nearly 50% of the yarn factories across the country were shut down. The highest spot cotton price for the whole year was 64.5 yuan for Lingbao cotton, and the lowest was 36.75 yuan for Tongzhou cotton, a difference of 27.7 yuan. The arrivals at the wharf were 256,478 bales of Tongzhou cotton, an increase of 100,541 bales compared to the 151,068 bales in the previous year. The arrivals of Yao cotton were 307,828 bales, an increase of 129,785 bales compared to the 178,043 bales in the previous year. The transaction volume of spot cotton for the whole year and the previous year is listed below.</p>
<p>The monthly highest and lowest prices for spot goods in Shanghai are listed below.</p>
<p>(Note) The above spot transaction prices are calculated according to the old system of Sima weights per dan. Spot goods are delivered to the wharf. A total of 256,478 bales of Tongzhou arrived throughout the year, calculated at 120 catties per bale. A total of 307,828 bales of Yuyao cotton arrived, calculated at 60 catties per bale.</p>

<p>— Ping</p>
<p>The "January 28th" Battle of Shanghai was a page in the history of the Chinese nation's liberation struggle, a glorious and tragic commemoration for the people of the whole country, which no one will ever forget! However, the "January 28th" incident is now exactly four years ago, and the depth of the national crisis is becoming more and more outrageous. The voices of "independence" and "autonomy" are getting louder and louder, and large chunks of land are being turned into someone else's territory, while we are just enduring, compromising, not resisting, surrendering, and not even allowed to cry out in pain, only allowed to be a docile lamb, alas! What kind of world is this?</p>
<p>The current China has truly reached the final moment of life and death! People are not only seizing our treasures, but simply want to destroy our race! At this time, a few traitors like Yin Rugeng are kneeling to foreigners; compatriots across the country should first denounce these traitors; because if we become more and more timid and our ranks are disorganized, then the enemy will definitely be arrogant and their desires will be endless!</p>
<p>Of course, we agree with the idea of not giving up on peace until it is absolutely hopeless, but according to the current situation, when will we consider peace to be hopeless?</p>
<p>I am a citizen, and I dare not lag behind others in loving my country. What I see as a danger, I am not afraid to express. I hope that all my compatriots will awaken!</p>
<h3 id="e187">A Study of "Bai Xiang" <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Shijiu</p>
<p>The soft language of Wu dialect has always been admired. Even a word like "baixiang" is so short that even if northerners and Cantonese speakers can't learn other aspects of the Suzhou dialect, they will still shout "baixiang, baixiang," and this word has become popular everywhere.</p>
<p>"Baixiang" means to play and wander. Literally: "bai" means empty; "xiang" means to look, pronounced with a departing tone. Therefore, "baixiang" means "to look around idly"; by extension, it means "to wander around aimlessly," which is to play. The Wujiang Chronicle says that "baixiang" is written as "beixiang." "Bei" is a yin star, so "beixiang" also has the meaning of "looking at women."</p>
<p>In the Ming Dynasty, "baixiang" was often written as "baishang." This can be proven by popular novels of the time. In the fourteenth chapter of "Stone Nodding" by Tianran Chisou, "Pan Wenzi契合鴛鴦塚," it says: "There are also some 'old baishang' who want to hook up with rich officials who like male prostitutes..." Tianran Chisou was from Suzhou, so he unconsciously used the dialect "old baishang" in the sentence. "Old baishang" means "old baixiang." This is proof number one.</p>
<p>As for what qualifications are required to be called an "old baishang," it is explained very clearly in the tenth story of "Dou Peng Xian Hua" by Nayi Jushi of Mingsheng Temple, "Huqiu Mountain Jia Qingke League." Jushi said: "There is another group who are like duckweed on the waves and maggots in the dung, always forming a pile when standing and a group when sitting, coming uninvited and not leaving when waved away, called 'old baishang.'" This is what is meant by "old baishang." Regarding the meaning of the two words "baishang," according to what Jushi heard people say, it means: "These people are naked and insert themselves everywhere, regardless of whether it is someone's landscape garden, antique female guests, without spending a penny, enjoying it all for free." "Baixiang" was written as "baishang" by people in the Ming Dynasty. This is proof number two.</p>
<p>If we further trace it back to ancient times, the "Book of Songs" Chenfeng has the line "not spinning hemp, but wandering in the market"; "Historical Records" has the line "　珊勃翠上金隄." "Posuo" and "　shan" are both transmutations of the sound "baixiang," what is called "similar sound but different characters." According to this, the origin of the word "baixiang" is very ancient.</p>

<p>— Zhuying</p>
<p>Every year at the end of the year—that is, the end of the lunar year—there is a seasonal food called rice cake. Shanghai is a Shanghai of Ningbo people, so after the Gregorian New Year, the rice cake shops on the streets and alleys, not to mention, are all making and selling Ningbo rice cakes. Even small sundry shops, small noodle restaurants, and fried tofu vermicelli stalls, in short, small-scale food shops, are also selling Ningbo rice cakes. In addition, there are some street-side houses that were originally vacant, where people temporarily rent them, put up big red signs saying "Genuine Ningbo Rice Cakes," and make and sell them at the same time. Also, tailor shops and Suzhou matchmakers will free up half of their storefronts and rent them to speculators to open temporary Ningbo rice cake shops. People who usually eat glutinous rice balls and fried dough sticks or bean paste dumplings for breakfast or snacks are all changing to eating white sugar rice cake balls. Ningbo people are indeed like this, and non-Ningbo people are also like this, so the glutinous rice ball sellers and dumpling sellers have to look up and sigh every day, except for changing careers and temporarily wholesaling Ningbo rice cakes, there is no other way out. Great is Ningbo rice cake at the end of the year in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Ningbo rice cakes are completely different from Suzhou-style sweet osmanthus rice cakes and lard rice cakes. Ningbo rice cakes absolutely do not contain any glutinous rice flour. Ningbo rice cakes are made entirely of hard rice. It is said that grinding rice cakes is more laborious than forging iron. Indeed, it is not an easy task to grind rice grains into Ningbo rice cakes that are stickier than glutinous rice flour. Ningbo rice cakes are bland, unlike Suzhou rice cakes, which should be sweet. But the reason why Ningbo rice cakes are so popular is also because of their bland taste. Because Ningbo rice cakes are bland, those who like to eat sweet can add sugar, fry, boil, or stir-fry, and those who like to eat salty can add shredded chicken and meat slices, as they please. However, it is said that the Ningbo rice cakes made in Shanghai are sticky, far less delicate and smooth than the genuine Ningbo rice cakes that come from Ningbo. Therefore, Ningbo people in Shanghai always say: "The Ningbo rice cakes made in Shanghai are sold to the people of Shanghai."</p>

If you insist on waiting two years, you'll regret it. The local man laughed: You, sir, are very fair, willing to speak for the land seller. Alright, let's talk again tomorrow. The man surnamed Jin also laughed: Hey! Hey! Why are you in such a hurry to leave? If the deal doesn't go through, we can still be friends. Please have a cigarette. Then there was the sound of striking a match, as if the host was lighting a cigarette for the guest. Jia Duocai's business acumen was much more astute than his skills in dealing with women. He immediately gently called the porter in, handed him a business card and said: Go to the next room and ask the guest if he is Mr. Jin Ziqiang? If that's right, tell him that I will come to visit him immediately. The porter smiled and whispered: He is surnamed Jin. He's very rich. Last winter, he came to Xi'an once and wanted to buy land. He's here again this time, still buying land. He's a capable man and has already bought several large plots of land. Do you, sir, know him? I heard that he wants to open a big factory and a big company in Xi'an, a very large scale. I was thinking of asking you, sir, to introduce me to Mr. Jin to get a job. Jia Duocai said: Go ask first if I even know this person. If I don't know him, what's the use of you saying so much? The porter left, and they only heard yelling from the next room: It's Mr. Jia living next door, that's great! Please come over quickly, let's talk first. Hearing the invitation, Jia Duocai answered that he was coming, and following the voice, he arrived in the next room. Jin Ziqiang rushed over and shook his hand, laughing: I was just worried about not having anyone to help, and I heard that Brother Jia was in Xi'an, I really wanted to talk to you, I didn't expect you to be living right next door. This is a great opportunity. I think that with a powerful friend like you to say a word about my land buying, things will go smoothly. Mr. Wang, come, let me introduce you, this is Mr. Jia Duocai, a banker. Their business in the East is extremely large. It's just that they are not sure when the train can be connected to Xi'an, so they are unwilling to invest in Shaanxi.

<h3 id="e191">Talking About Lucky Money <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Mingdao</p>
<p>Most people are very afraid of the end of the lunar new year, but children are very happy, because they can not only have fun, but also get gifts, the most common is the lucky money. Before New Year's Eve, it was customary for elders to distribute New Year's Eve plates to their children as a kind of New Year's gift for the lunar new year. The plate was naturally filled with all kinds of candies, which were the children's favorite. Nowadays, the style of the fruit plate is more and more novel and beautiful, and the price has also increased a lot. According to the Song Mengliang Record, during the Song Dynasty, the Neisi Yisi Bureau presented exquisite New Year's Eve fruit boxes, which shows that this custom already existed in the Song Dynasty. Besides the New Year's Eve plate, there must be lucky money attached. Now I will talk about the lucky money.</p>
<p>Lucky money and New Year's greetings money mean almost the same, it is two in one, but New Year's greetings money is given when children pay New Year's greetings in the new year, while lucky money is given to children before New Year's Eve. Elders from afar often send it by post, not only as a gift to children at the end of the year, but also containing a kind of blessing, hoping that children will be safe every year, suppress misfortunes, with good intentions. I remember when the author was a child, the lucky money I received was a string of white copper coins, all cast during the Qianlong, Jiaqing, Daoguang, and Tongzhi periods of the Qing Dynasty, white and thick. This kind of Qing dragon is rare today. Each string was one hundred wen, and those who gave away two strings were two hundred wen, taking the meaning of one hundred years and two hundred years, which is of course a very good omen. Later, silver coins were used instead, mostly new silver coins, and children often had a clanging sound in their pockets. Now that hard currency is no longer used and legal tender is circulating, then the lucky money is of course legal tender. Some people, because the legal tender on the market is broken and dirty, reducing its beauty, so they hide new banknotes in advance for gifting, and some also use new series of subsidiary currency coupons, gifting ten or twenty sheets. Only once did I see someone gifting two pounds to a child, which can be said to be extravagant, and some people gifting ancient coins, which is a unique lucky money.</p>
<p>Many children who get lucky money and New Year's money often put it in their own pockets and use it freely. At that time, there were especially many children's toys on the market, no matter new or old, they had to spend money to buy them, and many things were gone after playing, and some were damaged in a short period of time. For children, they spent money, and they had nothing to do, eating all day long. If they eat too much or eat unsanitary food, their stomach will be affected, even sick. From this point of view, there are advantages and disadvantages, and the disadvantages are not in the lucky money itself, but in the way it is used, as long as people know how to use it well.</p>
<p>How should lucky money be used well? The author believes that parents should calculate the amount their own children have received, and then think of good ways to still use it on the children, without losing its original intention. If there are many children in the family, then it is possible to collect the children's lucky money to buy several kinds of books that are beneficial to the children, so that the children can read and have fun during the winter vacation, which is better than all other improper games, and accumulated every year, it can become a children's library in the future. If there are few trees, you can also buy a useful thing every year as a souvenir. In addition to what is mentioned above, if the lucky money obtained by the children is not allowed to be used by the children, but is deposited in the bank every year, then accumulating little by little, it can be used to supplement the children's tuition fees in the future, and it can also cultivate the children's habit of saving, is it not a virtue? As for some parents who persuade children to use their lucky money as an airplane donation or to donate to disaster victims, it is also a good thing, which can increase children's love for the country and love for others. I have seen an old man who bought many useful things with the lucky money he received from his children and grandchildren and gave them to the children of poor families nearby, which is in line with the meaning of "love my young and extend it to the young of others." In short, it must be used in a normal way, so that there are advantages and no disadvantages.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Records of What I Saw <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— (Li Qing)</p>
<p>Near Xiaosha Ferry and Zhaojia Ferry, male and female workers often flock together in groups, which are particularly numerous in the morning and evening.</p>
<p>Wheelbarrows are also commonly used in the workers' area.</p>
<p>One evening, I passed by Yanping Road and saw five or six wheelbarrows chasing each other, full of male and female workers. You want to rush to the front, and I want to compete for the lead. They shouted noisily: Special express! Special express! Encouraging the drivers, and the pedestrians on the street also occasionally echoed.</p>
<p>However, an old driver was tired, and he had lost the balance of his wrist strength. The cart fell over, some fell on the road, some were alert and only fell halfway. Then a swarm of people started laughing triumphantly!</p>
<p>Special express! Special express! The passers-by on the roadside also clapped and laughed.</p>
<p>The true and sincere nature of the laborers is fully revealed!</p>

<h3 id="e193">Observations on Medical Affairs in Taiwan <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— (Xi Kang)</p>
<p>This year, a Taiwanese Medical Affairs Conference was held in Taiwan. Well-known scholars like Du Congming and Guo Songgen are from there. This trip to the South was partly to see them and partly to take the opportunity to inspect some of Taiwan Island's new facilities.</p>
<p>I recalled that when Taiwan was ceded to Japan, Li Hongzhang said to Ito Hirobumi: There are two troublesome things to deal with in Taiwan, one is diseases, and the other is the savages. Indeed, because Taiwan is located in the tropics, it has many infectious diseases such as malaria, bubonic plague, cholera, typhoid, and smallpox. However, Japanese scholars, precisely because Taiwanese people were prone to disease, were given more research material, adding to their academic progress. Through continuous efforts, they achieved significant success. Travelers who arrived in Taipei City for the first time could not see any traces of malaria or typhoid in that city. According to reports from the health authorities, if there were one or two cases of smallpox or malaria on the whole island, they were mostly brought in on ships from outside.</p>
<p>Regarding opium in Taiwan, the Japanese initially operated a monopoly, and the income was substantial. Although registration was in place, it was quite lenient. Recently, after several resolutions of the International League of Nations to ban smoking, the Japanese administration has become stricter. Their smoking ban plan and methods for quitting smoking are considered comprehensive. Dr. Du Congming, a professor of pharmacology at Taipei Medical College, has done truly admirable research work in this area.</p>
<p>In the foothills, malaria is prevalent due to the abundance of water and paddy fields. Chronic malaria, in particular, is often encountered. They have regulations for compulsory blood tests. The authorities provide workers with a day's wage to implement compulsory blood tests. At the same time, there is also compulsory treatment. The authorities also issue wages, and patients can be treated in hospitals without any expense.</p>
<p>Because there are many insects in Taiwan, a special insect research laboratory has been established to study the pathology, prevention, and treatment of insects harmful to the human body.</p>
<p>Also, because general physicians are unwilling to practice medicine in remote areas, the authorities have created "public doctors," giving them titles, providing financial assistance, and offering various conveniences. This way, general physicians are happy to do it.</p>
<p>There are some additional medical matters in Taiwan to report: old doctors in Taiwan are called "yisheng" (醫生). The authorities allow existing "yisheng" to continue practicing, but do not allow new "yisheng" to be created. On the other hand, they are working hard to create new doctors—called "yishi" (醫師). They have adopted a two-tier medical education system because they want to adapt to the needs of the environment and do not hesitate to produce new doctors. Moreover, to improve their knowledge, they provide retraining for unqualified physicians. In total, the current ratio of physicians to residents is one physician for every 2,800 residents.</p>
<p>I think that our compatriots number 400 million. Therefore, if there is one physician for every 4,000 people, we need to produce 100,000 physicians to cover the population. If the number of physicians produced nationwide each year is 1,000 (according to the Ministry of Education's statistics, there were 226 medical graduates in the 22nd year of the Republic), it will take 100 years to achieve our desire. Isn't this a case of distant water not being able to quench a fire nearby? Medical educators must think about the future of the nation and the people, and look at the needs of reality. How should they make comprehensive plans to cope with this extraordinary period of survival competition?</p>
<h3 id="e194">"Hypersensitiveness" <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Yue Qi</p>
<p>—Medical Stories, No. 16—</p>
<p>With the development of pathology, the causes of various human diseases have been elucidated one after another. In this stage of discovering the causes of diseases, "hypersensitiveness" is considered the latest invention regarding the causes of diseases. What is "hypersensitiveness"? It means that a certain part of the human body is "hypersensitive" to the presence of a certain substance, thus causing an adverse reaction, while the same substance is harmless to other human bodies.</p>
<p>The first person to publish this symptom was Heany ahyde Salter in 1867. Salter published a book describing his own asthma. In this book, he said: "The cause of my asthma is being close to ordinary domestic cats. I can't remember when I first developed this disease, but I believe it started in childhood. When I sit by the fire and the cat lies on the hearth rug, my asthma flares up; if the cat is closer to me, my asthma becomes more severe. Accompanying the asthma are sneezing and tearing."</p>
<p>In fact, many people are hypersensitive to animal effluvia. Among them, the most sensitive are those to horse hair. Most of them suffer from asthma as soon as they approach horses. Some also have skin rashes; and also sneeze and tear. In addition to horses, animals such as dogs, cows, chicken feathers, and duck feathers can make some people feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Not only animals, but also plants can cause the same reaction. The most common is "hay fever" caused by plant pollen. The scientific basis of knowledge about hay fever was established by Blackley. In 1873 and 1880, he successively published two books explaining hay fever. Blackley himself often suffered from hay fever; he was convinced that the disease was caused by pollen from grasses. He collected pollen, stored it, and sure enough, it triggered the same hay fever. He also exposed gelatin plates to the air in summer, thus discovering what plant pollen was scattered in the air during the hay fever season.</p>
<p>A certain girl suffered from a severe skin rash that could not be cured after repeated treatments. Later, the doctor advised her to travel to a spring resort in the suburbs. When she arrived there, her skin disease was cured. After a week, she returned home, and the old disease recurred. The doctor was quite surprised and decided to go to her home to investigate. He found that every window frame in her living room was filled with potted primroses. He pushed open the windows and threw the primrose pots out of the window. Soon, the girl's skin disease was completely cured.</p>
<p>For children, certain foods are the cause of hypersensitive reactions. Some cause asthma, some cause skin rashes, some cause chest discomfort, and some cause dysentery. A special aversion to certain foods is usually mistaken for a nervous disorder. Dr. Clinton Ning said that one of his patients could not eat walnuts. With just a small bite of walnut meat, he would have a severe asthma attack; swallowing half a walnut would cause him to have skin rashes in addition to asthma.</p>
<p>There is also an interesting story about "hypersensitiveness." A certain woman often suffered from asthma, but not the kind of asthma caused by pollen, like hay fever. After a long period of observation, she determined that her asthma was caused by wiping her gold watch, because every time she wiped the watch, she would have an asthma attack. It turned out that she was using boxwood shavings to wipe the watch, and boxwood shavings would cause her a special reaction. She decided to let her gold watch get dirty and not wipe it, and her asthma did not recur.</p>

<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(77) Nocturnal Enuresis (Eruresis Nocturna) (Q) Why do some children often suffer from nocturnal enuresis?</p>
<p>(A) Because these children have a family history of nervous disposition, which causes urinary dysfunction and cannot be controlled by will.</p>
<p>(Q) At what age do children suffer from nocturnal enuresis the most?</p>
<p>(A) Most children are between the ages of six and ten. During nighttime sleep, urine is involuntarily discharged, and the bedding is soaked. (Q) Do adults also suffer from nocturnal enuresis?</p>
<p>(A) A few people also suffer from this disease.</p>
<p>(Q) In addition to nervous disposition, what other causes are there for nocturnal enuresis? (A) There are many other causes that can cause nocturnal enuresis. Such as phimosis, bladder stones, and parasite infection of roundworms and pinworms.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the condition of people with nocturnal enuresis when they wet the bed at night?</p>
<p>(A) The patient urinates unconsciously or due to dreaming after going to bed. Most of them urinate within one hour after falling asleep, or when it is about to dawn. They only become aware of it after waking up. Some wake up immediately after urinating.</p>
<p>(Q) Do people with nocturnal enuresis have any difficulty urinating during the day? (A) There is no difficulty in urinating during the day.</p>
<p>(Q) Is there any impact on the patient's mental state?</p>
<p>(A) If it is not treated for a long time, the mental state often falls into a state of depression. (Q) Can childhood nocturnal enuresis be completely cured?</p>
<p>(A) Childhood nocturnal enuresis can completely disappear at a certain age or when the nervous system is fully developed.</p>
<p>(Q) Can adult nocturnal enuresis be cured?</p>
<p>(A) Adult nocturnal enuresis is very difficult to treat. It is easy to become a stubborn symptom. (Q) What should be paid attention to in the diet of people with nocturnal enuresis? (A) The amount of beverages should be restricted every afternoon, and foods rich in moisture should be avoided. (Q) Is there a regular method for urination time?</p>
<p>(A) Urination should be forced before going to bed. He can be awakened three hours after going to bed to urinate. One end of the foot end of the bed must be raised. (Q) What are the drug treatment methods for nocturnal enuresis?</p>
<p>(A) Smelling agents, atropine, Lois tincture, etc. can be taken internally (must be prescribed by a doctor); or tetrodotoxin can be injected. (Q) What is the effectiveness of physical therapy?</p>
<p>(A) Physical therapies such as galvano-faradization, hydrotherapy, climatotherapy, and physiological saline injection are quite effective.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Measles Prevention Methods <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Shou Qiu</p>
<p>During a certain period, measles suddenly became prevalent in Nanjing. Many, many children were suffering from measles. Although most of them were cured, there were also quite a few who lost their lives because of it. Afterwards, the Nanjing Municipal Health Office invited medical scientists to study prevention methods, and considerable results have already been obtained. Yesterday, a special notice was issued to parents of children throughout the city. The original text clearly explains the symptoms, prevention, and treatment of measles. Now, I will write it down to make parents with children all over the country pay attention. Measles is commonly known as "zhenzi" (疹子) or "shazi" (痧子), and it is a highly contagious disease that especially easily affects children. Once they get this disease, they often develop other complications due to inadequate care, which can lead to life-threatening dangers. The cause of measles is a filterable bacterium invading the human body. This bacterium is mostly present in the patient's nasal discharge, tears, sputum, and oral secretions. It is also in the blood, and people can be infected by contact.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>After measles bacteria invade the human body, it takes more than ten days for the rash to appear. This period is called the incubation period. At the beginning of the disease, it is slightly similar to a cold and flu, followed by chills, fever, conjunctivitis (commonly known as red eye), increased eye secretions, cough, sneezing, tearing, and a yellow coating on the tongue. Sometimes, on the second or third day, upon careful examination, there are often grayish-white small spots inside the cheeks, opposite the blood teeth. This is called "Koplik's spots" and is an important point for early diagnosis of the disease. By the fourth day, the fever continues to rise, and small dark red rashes with distinct boundaries and surrounding the pores appear on the face and both sides of the nose. It spreads from the head to the chest and abdomen; and to the limbs; all over the body. The new situation is most severe during this period of rash. After the illness, it is easy to develop other complications, such as pneumonia, bronchitis, nephritis, lymphadenectasis, otitis media, enteritis, and mouth necrosis (noma, commonly known as "zou ma gan" 走馬疳). Patients often face danger because of this. If properly cared for, after the rash appears, the fever will quickly subside after three or four days, and the rash will gradually disappear and recover. Transmission method: Measles is always transmitted by direct contact. Contact with the patient's nose or oral secretions can transmit the disease and cause it to occur. Measles patients are usually able to transmit the disease to others during the incubation period until after the rash appears, as long as there are still secretions. The prevention methods and nursing methods for measles are listed below:</p>
<p>The measles prevention methods are: Measles mostly affects children. The mortality rate of children under three years old is the highest, about 40 times higher than that of children over three years old. Therefore, children under the age of three should try to avoid infection with the disease. If there are children in the family suspected of having measles, they should be isolated from other children. Do not let them live in the same room, and do not let them come into contact with each other. Even the family members who are caring for measles patients must not come into contact with other healthy children to avoid infection. If a neighbor's child has measles, the entire family should not approach them. Anyone who has been in contact with the patient should pay special attention. If there are symptoms such as nasal congestion and fever, they should quickly seek medical examination in order to isolate and treat them early. The house where the patient has lived should have all four windows opened to allow sufficient air and sunlight. If measles occurs in a school, the family should order the children to suspend school for fourteen days to avoid infection. Injecting measles convalescent serum or mother's blood can temporarily avoid measles. Convalescent serum is not easy to obtain, but mother's blood can be obtained anytime and anywhere. The procedure is extremely simple, and ordinary doctors can perform it. The method is to draw five cubic centimeters of blood from the mother's vein and immediately inject it into the child's gluteal muscle. There is no reaction after the injection. There are three key points for the injection: (A) The injection of mother's blood is best performed within the first five days after contact to prevent the disease. After five days, the disease cannot be absolutely prevented. However, it can still reduce the severity of the new situation. If the contact person already has symptoms, it will not take effect or reduce the symptoms. Therefore, if your own child has had contact with someone with measles or if one child in the family has measles and the other children have not yet shown any symptoms, this injection should be performed immediately in the hope of preventing the disease from occurring. Even if it cannot be prevented, it can reduce the severity of the new situation. (B) The injection of mother's blood should be given to children under three years old. Children over three years old do not need to be given the injection. Because the mortality rate of measles is the lowest between the ages of three and adulthood, and then higher afterwards, measles is best contracted during this period, as the danger is less and lifelong immunity can be obtained. (C) The immunization time of injecting mother's blood is only a few weeks, so after the injection, it is still necessary to isolate the patient. If there is a person with measles in the family, the health office should be notified immediately so that staff can be sent to provide guidance on prevention and nursing or to perform mother's blood injections at various branches. As for nursing methods: The patient's room should be warm and humid; and the air must be kept fresh. The window further away from the patient should be opened. The temperature in the room is best around 70 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient's body should be kept warm, but the mouth and nose should be exposed to fresh air to prevent complications of pneumonia and bronchitis. The patient's eyes are afraid of light, so they should wear an eye mask or make the room light slightly darker. The eyes can be washed with boric acid. Special attention should be paid to the cleanliness of the patient's mouth to prevent complications. The mouth can also be rinsed with boric acid water. The patient's diet should be liquid food to prevent enteritis. And drink more boiled water. If the patient coughs or has shortness of breath, seek medical treatment immediately. Report ear diseases to the doctor to prevent complications of otitis media. After recovering from measles, there should be a full two weeks of rest. Pay attention to preventing colds and other infectious diseases, and especially pay attention to complications of pulmonary tuberculosis. If there is another fever, seek medical treatment immediately.</p>

<h3 id="e197">Domestic Medicinal Plants (Continued) <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Mengbai</p>
<p>(12) Pyrethrum (Chrysanthenun Cinerasiifoliun, Bocc.) Insektenblune (German) Insectflower (English)</p>
<p>(Plant) Native to Dalmatia, Austria. It can be cultivated everywhere. It is a perennial herb. The stem is sparse and long, about 30-60 cm high. The stems and leaves are densely covered with silky hairs. The leaves have long stalks, 213-fold pinnately divided, the lobes are linear, slightly powdery white. In early summer, flower stems are extracted, the flower stems are branched, and numerous heads open. The head flower diameter is about one centimeter inside and out, and the ray flowers are white.</p>
<p>(Cultivation Method) Sow in the seedbed in late September, and transplant to the field in April of the following year. This field mostly uses wheat stubble, without separate land preparation and other procedures. Drill a hole next to the wheat plants and plant one or two plants, with a distance of about one foot between them. Wenzhou and Changzhou in my country have also produced a lot in recent years. Fertilizer is mainly human manure and artificial fertilizer. It blooms early the year after sowing. When the ray flowers around the head flower are open and most of the disc flowers are not open, it is the appropriate time to harvest. Pick the flowers and dry them in the sun. Each mu can harvest more than a hundred catties of dried flowers.</p>
<p>The stems and leaves are dried, ground into powder, and can be used as mosquito coils, which are also in considerable demand.</p>
<p>(Crude Drug) Pyrethrum Flower (Flos Pyrethri) is made by collecting the heads of pyrethrum and drying them in the sun. This product has a flower bed with a diameter of about one centimeter inside and out. The flower bed is made of about forty bracts, surrounded by involucres, and there is a row of ray flowers inside, and disc flowers inside. Those without flower stalks are top-grade. There are about 15-20 ray flowers. The dried product is wrinkled and curved, slightly yellowish in white, about one centimeter long and 2-4 millimeters wide. The upper end of the disc flower is five-lobed, slightly yellow, the cylindrical part is dirty white, 2.5 mm long and 0.7 mm in diameter. This product has a special aroma.</p>
<p>When this product powder is examined under a microscope, there are countless pollens and flower tissue fragments. The pollen is spherical, yellowish-brown, 28-40u in diameter, with countless protrusions. The amount of pollen is the standard for whether pyrethrum powder is good or not, because the amount of pollen varies depending on whether there are adulterants and whether the flower picking period is appropriate. Mr. Fujita said that powder with less than 1300 pollen grains per milligram cannot be called a good product. Excellent products on the market often contain more than 5000 pollen grains. The most obvious tissue fragments are T-shaped hairs, epidermis, ray flower corolla, pollen, and fibers of bracts.</p>
<p>(Ingredients) The active ingredients in pyrethrum are called Pyetbrin I (C21H30O3) and Pyretbrin II (C22H30O5), which are liquid substances, the content of which is about 0.3% in total. If hydrolyzed, the insecticidal effect disappears immediately.</p>
<p>It also contains crystalline special Pyretbrol (C11H30O) and a small amount of essential oil. These ingredients have no insecticidal effect.</p>
<p>(Pharmacology) The active ingredient of this plant belongs to a kind of neuromuscular toxin. When applied to warm-blooded animals, it can cause strong epileptic convulsions, and due to the excitement of the vasomotor nerve center, it causes a significant increase in blood pressure. The excitement of the respiratory center improves respiratory function. A rabbit weighing one kilogram, when injected with two milligrams of this ingredient intravenously, will cause severe poisoning symptoms, and can recover within a few minutes. If taken internally in one gram, no phenomenon will occur.</p>
<p>(Uses) Pyrethrum flower powder is often used to make insecticide powder and mosquito coils. Mosquito coils are usually made by mixing pyrethrum flowers and stems and leaves powder with tabu powder (Tabu bark Cortex Machili powder), then adding green dye (commonly known as green bamboo), and adjusting with warm water to make it solidify like dough. It is squeezed into a mosquito coil extruder to form a thin line-like object, which is cut and dried at an appropriate length. Its shape is a spiral and it is made with bamboo silk as the core, like incense sticks.</p>
<p>It is also used in large quantities as an agricultural insecticide. But it is usually used as pyrethrum soap emulsion. The method of preparation is to first crush 2 ounces of pyrethrum flowers, soak them in 1 liter of petroleum, and after two days and nights, filter them with 1.2-1.5 ounces of soap powder and 5 cups of water to make an emulsion. When using, water can be added or not, but water should be added in an amount of 2-5 times. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Section 3 Alveolar Pyorrhea</p>
<p>(Question 92) What are the symptoms of the second type?</p>
<p>(Answer) This disease is deeper. The gums are not as red and swollen as the first type, but often feel white and anemic. The periodontal membrane is destroyed very quickly, starting from the head of the tooth. The alveolar bone (that is, the jaw bone) near the head of the tooth gradually recedes. The gums also recede with it, gradually separating from the teeth. The separation forms a pocket, which stores pus and often flows out. There are often hard dental stones attached to the teeth in the pocket. The teeth become loose and eventually fall out. The patient's mouth is very smelly. Amoeba parasites are often found in the pocket.</p>
<p>(Question 93) What are the symptoms of the third type?</p>
<p>(Answer) This type of alveolar pyorrhea is mostly caused by systemic diseases. Its symptoms are also inconsistent. For example, if it is caused by venereal disease or pulmonary tuberculosis, the new situation progresses extremely quickly, the alveolar bone is rapidly destroyed, pus often flows, the teeth become loose, and treatment takes a long time. If it is caused by diabetes, the gums are swollen, the periodontal membrane is inflamed, and there is a feeling of soreness. Pus may or may not be present.</p>
<p>(Question 94) What are the harms of the pus produced by alveolar pyorrhea?</p>
<p>(Answer) The harms of this pus are the same as the harms of the pus from periodontitis mentioned in the previous section. However, there is more pus, and the harm is more severe. Therefore, people with alveolar pyorrhea, if not treated early, will often experience reduced health, yellow complexion, and fatigue over time.</p>
<p>(Question 95) If the affected tooth falls out or is extracted, the pus will stop and the symptoms will disappear. However, the disease continues to progress in the adjacent teeth. Therefore, people with this disease often end up with all their teeth falling out or being extracted. Removing all teeth is also a way to prevent the danger of pus.</p>

<p>Section 6: Specialized Stimulatory Therapy - Tuberculin</p>
<p>Long-term tuberculin treatment generally has good effects on common symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis, such as increased temperature, headache, cough, and weakness.</p>
<p>Poor appetite, night sweats, and various other symptoms generally show good results. However, in terms of treatment, not every type of the disease is suitable. Certain forms are quite inappropriate. Usually, fresh infiltration and excessively large areas of infiltration cannot withstand excessive stimulation, so its application is not very suitable. It is absolutely forbidden for those with cavities and high fever, and the same goes for those with a tendency to hemoptysis. Even for mild cases, there's no need to go to such lengths! It is suitable for chronic forms where the temperature is not currently elevated or not very high; generally, below 38 degrees Celsius, there is usually not much to worry about. For children, chronic forms are also preferable. In terms of the nature of the disease, proliferative types are mostly suitable, while exudative types should not be lightly attempted. Individuals react differently to tuberculin; therefore, the dosage, whether light or heavy, increased or decreased, must rely entirely on the physician's unique discernment and careful consideration. It should never be rigidly adhered to as a fixed rule, nor should it be blindly followed.</p>
<p>There are several commonly seen preparations of tuberculin, but there is not much difference between them. The most commonly seen is still Koch's Old Tuberculin; it is made by taking a pure glycerin broth culture of tubercle bacilli, filtering it after six to eight weeks, and extracting the mutual elements of the bacterial body. In addition, there are several tuberculin-like preparations, which can be said to be improved tuberculin preparations, but so far, there have been no significant clinical results. This article will not cite them one by one!</p>
<p>There are already many specialized books on the detailed usage of tuberculin. It is definitely beyond the scope of this series, and besides, this series is not intended for physicians, so there is no need to be overly detailed. However, the author has a few words to offer to the readers. That is, the use of tuberculin is by no means a simple method. The allocation of dosage, if slightly neglected, is truly a case of "a difference of a hair's breadth leads to a discrepancy of a thousand miles." If a patient undergoes this treatment, they must have a deep understanding and belief in all the instructions given by the doctor. Things like checking body temperature before and after injections, fixed daily temperature checks, and quiet rest for a certain period after injections are all very tedious, which most patients are unwilling to hear, but patients must not neglect them. If a reaction occurs, patients need not be afraid or speculate wildly, but must rest absolutely quietly. It should be known that this situation is not entirely impossible. Furthermore, the entire treatment period is very long, and patients must have sufficient patience, and must not doubt it because of occasional deviations. If all these things are not deeply understood, on the doctor's side, it may just feel like an unnecessary effort, or even giving up on previous efforts, and the loss is small; but on the patient's side, the loss in terms of body and money is truly incomparable! I hope readers will pay attention!</p>

<h3 id="e200">A Discussion on the Complications of Gonorrhea <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— (Dr. Luo Minxiu)</p>
<p>What are the complications of gonorrhea? It refers to after being infected with gonorrhea, the gonococcus spreads to organs near the reproductive organs, such as the prostate, testicles, seminal vesicles, and spermatic cord in men, and the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries in women, as well as various organs throughout the body for both men and women, such as the joints, heart, bladder, kidneys, and rectum. All can be affected by gonorrhea and develop symptoms. The most common complication of gonorrhea in men is gonorrheal orchitis. This condition occurs when gonococci invade the epididymis from the vas deferens. Patients often cannot move due to abnormal swelling and pain. The next most common is prostatitis. Acute prostatitis is extremely painful, and chronic prostatitis inevitably leads to neurasthenia even after recovery. If seminal vesiculitis and spermatic cord inflammation occur, fertility will also be affected. There are also urethral strictures and cystitis. Sometimes, gonococci invade upwards and cause nephritis. In addition, gonococci can enter the bloodstream and cause arthritis in various parts of the body, following the blood circulation. Mild cases take one to two months to recover, while severe cases can become lifelong disabilities. Arthritis is often accompanied by carditis. In summary, the complications of gonorrhea are numerous. Deaths caused by complications of gonorrhea are not uncommon. Therefore, can those infected with gonorrhea afford to take it lightly and delay treatment? Although there are many treatments for gonorrhea, the most appropriate is to receive formal, reasonable, and reliable medical care. The Sun Weicai Father and Son Hospital on Ningbo Road in the French Concession of this city has rich experience and adequate facilities, and employs many doctors. It can completely cure acute and chronic gonorrhea in men and women, as well as various complications caused by gonorrhea, in a very short period of time. Therefore, it is deeply trusted by the general public.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Casual Remarks on Mianli (Face Beauty Cream) <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— (Pharmacist Zhu Qiuyuan)</p>
<p>Mianli is a modern scientific preparation. Its functions include promoting skin metabolism, absorbing facial oils, and unblocking sweat glands to prevent blockage. Therefore, it has remarkable effects on those with freckles and acne on their faces. Regular use can also make the skin white like condensed fat and turn rough skin into delicate skin. The manufacturing of Mianli is all in accordance with regulations. What is mixed first, what is added later, what is dissolved in high heat, and what is condensed in low temperature. Chemical methods are used to precisely combine various skin-beneficial drugs into a white fragrant cream. The raw materials used in Mianli are exceptionally strict. Only those that are definitely effective and absolutely beneficial to the skin are qualified. At the same time, the inclusion of medicinal materials must also have its own special characteristics. They must be especially effective in removing spots and rejuvenating the face, or have a specialty in whitening and brightening the skin. Efforts are made to ensure that each medicinal material is used to its full potential, without being merely decorative. Mianli has a fine powder texture and a fragrant smell. Applying it to the face is as pleasant as applying fragrant powder. In this winter season, rather than using other creams, it is better to use Mianli to achieve two benefits with one action.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Remedy for Weakness <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— (Luo Minxiu) (Physician)</p>
<p>For only with a healthy body can one have a full spirit. With a full spirit, one can have keen thoughts. When the body is healthy, the spirit is full, and the mind is sharp, then one's career succeeds. When the body is weak, the spirit is feeble, and the mind is dull, then one's career fails. This is a definite and immutable principle. In modern times, people are immersed in hobbies, such as gambling, alcohol, tobacco, and lust, all of which harm the body, deplete the spirit, and ruin affairs. In particular, the indulgence in sexual desires is especially serious. Some repeatedly engage in prostitution, or mistakenly practice masturbation. As days pass, habits form naturally. As a result, essence is exhausted, marrow is depleted, blood is defiled, qi is weakened, the skin is thin, the complexion is pale, palpitations are exacerbated, breathing is rapid, the head is heavy and dizzy, the ears ring, the eyes are blurred, there are nocturnal emissions and impotence, and premature ejaculation. These are all symptoms of weakness. Rolling around in bed, listless and weak, although bearing human form, one is already devoid of vitality. Therefore, to have a healthy body, a full spirit, and a sharp mind, it is essential to be cautious in making friends, abstain from desires, quit masturbation, irradiate with artificial sun lamps, and take "Heerbon" tablets internally to replenish blood, strengthen the brain, solidify essence, and benefit intelligence as the primary task. (Note: "Heerbon" is a sacred remedy for weakness. The price is two yuan per bottle. It is exclusively distributed by Shanghai Tongren Western Drug Store.)</p>
<h3 id="e203">Miraculous Pills for Leukorrhea <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— (Female Doctor Shen Qinghuai)</p>
<p>If a medicine is called "miraculous," its remarkable efficacy can be known. If a medicine is called "elixir," its excellent manufacture can be known. The Miraculous Pills for Leukorrhea are the internally taken Leukorrhea Pills and externally used Leukorrhea Medicine sold by Sun Weicai Father and Son Hospital on Ningbo Road in the French Concession of Shanghai. It can treat ordinary leukorrhea in women, as well as leukorrhea infected with gonorrhea. Used internally and externally, it is invariably effective in curing the disease. It can also warm the uterus, regulate menstruation, replenish blood, strengthen the stomach, and invigorate the body and brain. Therefore, among women who cannot conceive due to leukorrhea, those who have been cured by this product and have the joy of obtaining a son are numerous. The price for internal use is two yuan per box, and the price for external use is also one yuan per box. It truly deserves to be called the miraculous pills for leukorrhea and the sacred remedy for gynecology. Moreover, the most common type of leukorrhea is uterine inflammation, often caused by the invasion of gonococci. Regarding its treatment, according to my experience, the first is to prevent the spread of inflammation, the second is to prevent pathogens from invading the uterine tissue, the third is to have the great power to kill pathogens, and the fourth is to stop the flow of leukorrhea and eliminate the patient's suffering. To achieve this goal, we must have effective medicines for external and internal use. These Leukorrhea Pills and Leukorrhea Medicine are the most effective. In my clinical practice, I generally use them to treat women's leukorrhea, and the results are excellent.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Excessive Stomach Acid and Stomach Pain <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— (Pharmacist Ma Yin)</p>
<p>Hyperacidity is the excessive secretion of hydrochloric acid in the stomach. Patients often experience belching, acid reflux, heartburn, burning sensations in the stomach, and pain one or two hours after eating. These symptoms are exacerbated by eating sour, greasy, glutinous rice, or sweet pastries, and the stomach pain becomes more severe. Moreover, if this condition is not treated properly, it is likely to lead to stomach ulcers. This is because the stomach wall is stimulated and corroded by the acidic gastric juice. Once there is a slight injury to the gastric mucosa, it is not easy to heal and an ulcer forms. Patients with hyperacidity also suffer from stomach pain even when fasting. The treatment method is that patients should be careful with their diet and take alkaline drugs such as sodium bicarbonate to neutralize the acidity. "Wei Bi Ling" medicinal powder is a specific and effective medicine for this condition. It not only neutralizes the excessively acidic gastric juice, but also has the effect of immediately stopping pain and aiding digestion. (Note: "Wei Bi Ling" powder, for the treatment of stomach pain and stomach diseases, has long been famous at home and abroad, and the price is also low. Each box costs only one yuan and can be taken for several days. It is distributed by Tongren Western Drug Store, No. 1 Dexing Lane, West Xinqiao Street, French Concession, Shanghai.)</p>

<p>— (Physician She Zhen)</p>
<p>In the past, doctors who helped people quit smoking mostly used internal medicine alone and rarely used injectable drugs. With the advancement of modern medicine, it is now known that using addictive narcotics to quit smoking is ultimately slow. Therefore, the invention of egg yolk lecithin injection was invented to quit smoking. It is very fast and has unexpectedly miraculous effects. Once implemented, it can gradually reduce the smoking addiction until the addiction is completely gone. In my clinical experiments, the results have been countless. I am specially recording the two most recent cases for fellow countrymen who are trapped in the dark addiction. (1) Mr. Wu, from Jiaxing, complained that he became addicted to opium smoking due to socializing and playing games. He started by smoking one qian, and now he smokes four or five qian a day, and still cannot get enough. As a result, he is mentally and physically depleted and as thin as a rake. He had sought medical treatment to quit smoking last year, but ultimately could not break the addiction. Introduced by a friend, he came to the hospital to quit smoking. I immediately gave him an egg yolk lecithin injection once a day and gave him internal medicine. The patient had no pain. In less than fourteen days, he completely quit. (2) Mr. Zhang, from Jinan, started smoking to relieve abdominal pain, which led to addiction. It has been more than three years now. Currently, he smokes three times a day, and each time he needs one qian and five fen. He came to the hospital to request quitting smoking. I gave him nearly twenty injections of egg yolk lecithin, one after another. After three weeks, he completely quit. His abdominal pain also did not recur. (Editor's note: Physician She Zhen is a master of quitting smoking. Those who he has helped quit never relapse. Those quitting also have no feeling of discomfort. His clinic is located at No. 64 Ningbo Road, French Concession, Shanghai.)</p>

<p>— (Physician Zhou Kechang)</p>
<p>Mr. Wang, who is in the dried goods business, felt pain when urinating four days after visiting prostitutes. Gradually, pus dripped out, the glans was red, and the foreskin was swollen. He sought consultation from me. I immediately examined his pus under a microscope and saw countless gonococci. I diagnosed him with acute gonorrhea. However, due to other reasons, the patient could not come for treatment every day and asked me to find a solution. I ordered him to buy "Gonado-Toden" and take it himself. He then came for a follow-up visit once every three days. According to him, on the same day after taking "Gonado-Toden", he felt that the pain gradually disappeared, urination became smooth, and the swelling subsided slightly. The next day, the pus discharge decreased. I re-examined his pus and the number of gonococci was greatly reduced. I ordered him to continue taking it. On the fourth day, the redness and swelling were greatly reduced. On the fifth day, the pus became thin. On the sixth day, he came for another follow-up visit. Under microscopic examination, only a few gonococci were seen. I ordered him to continue taking it for a week and he completely recovered his health. Under microscopic examination, the presence of gonococci could no longer be proven. "Gonado-Toden" is sold at Tongren Western Drug Store, No. 1 Dexing Lane, West Xinqiao Street, French Concession of this city. The price is two yuan per box.</p>

<p>— (Manuscript from Xu Yuan Peizhen)</p>
<p>Because I had many freckles on my face, I paid attention to almost every spot-treating medicine on the market, and I tried them all. But in the end, it was all in vain and I was disappointed. In the middle of last month, my cousin Renfang returned from Shanghai. She gave me a bottle of "Mianli", saying that it was very effective in treating freckles and acne. She said that one of her [unclear characters] in Shanghai [unclear characters] had her freckles removed by "Mianli". So it was very credible and reliable. I gladly thanked her and accepted it. Since I started applying this bottle of Mianli, I didn't see anything at first. Later, I looked in the mirror every day to check the spots on my face. Sure enough, they were fading day by day. After about half a month, I had already used seven or eight tenths of this bottle of Mianli. My previous freckles have completely disappeared without a trace. I specially wrote a letter to thank the Shanghai Tongren Western Drug Store, which sells this product. And I also presented four characters: "Turning Ugliness into Beauty". In this world, there are countless young men and women who suffer from freckles and cannot be cured. Therefore, I do not hesitate to write this in my humble writing during my embroidery break and submit it to this journal, and I also thank my cousin.</p>

<p>Cure My Stomach Pain</p>
<p>I have suffered from stomach pain for a long time. Previously, my relative introduced me to "Wei Bi Ling" produced by Shanghai Tongren Western Drug Store, saying that it was quite effective. So I mailed to purchase two boxes. The effect was as good as they said after taking it. However, I have suddenly suffered from spermatorrhea in recent years. I heard that "Heerbon" is very effective in treating spermatorrhea. I don't know if this is true. (Asked by Zhang Liuzhai) (Answer) "Heerbon" is extremely effective in treating spermatorrhea, kidney deficiency, and other symptoms. This medicine is also a good medicine produced by Shanghai French Concession, West Xinqiao Street, Dexing Lane No. 1, Tongren Western Drug Store. The price is two yuan per bottle. Mild cases can be cured with one or two bottles.</p>
<p>Acute Leukorrhea</p>
<p>I indulged in pleasure for a moment and contracted leukorrhea. It has been dripping and painful for ten days. I know that if I don't seek medical treatment as soon as possible, it will become a lifelong burden. But there are many hospitals in Shanghai, and I don't know which one to choose. I have always known that your publication benefits patients. I dare to ask for guidance. (Asked by Gao Lingyun) (Answer) Sun Weicai Father and Son Hospital on Ningbo Road in the French Concession of this city is the most famous hospital in Shanghai for treating venereal diseases. Experienced doctors are hired to preside over the clinic, and the equipment can be said to be perfect. The Tias electro-therapy machine is the most suitable and effective for treating acute leukorrhea.</p>
<p>Also Treats Acne</p>
<p>I previously suffered from freckles on my face and tried many medicines, but none were effective. Later, I bought a spot-removing "Mianli" cream, and the freckles were completely gone before I finished using one bottle. My skin became soft. Now my younger brother suffers from acne. I don't know if he can use it. May I ask? (Asked by Mo Xiuzhen) (Answer) "Mianli" is not only a sacred product for curing freckles, but also can cure acne with extremely fast results.</p>

<h3 id="e210">The Lion and the Sheep <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Zinan</p>
<p>Our national essence advocates often use the lion to compare themselves. The lion is the king of all beasts, and our old and great China is also a large country with "vast land and abundant resources and more than 5,000 years of culture." Therefore, there is a subconscious idea that China is like a lion, with all nations coming to pay tribute.</p>
<p>However, the Chinese history of the past hundred years has really saddened the national essence advocates. Not only is there no phenomenon of all beasts submitting, but even the lion itself is often bitten off a tail one day and a leg the next, gradually being divided. Although this phenomenon is still explained by the national essence advocates, who are good at wishful thinking, as a "sleeping lion." But if a "sleeping lion" is bitten off its tail and legs and does not wake up, then even if it is still alive, it is probably not far from a "dead lion."</p>
<p>In stark contrast to the national essence advocates who desperately want to save face, are some defeatists and opportunists who see China as a lamb. Not only do they see China as a lamb, but they also see China as a lost lamb, thinking that it is wandering in a fork in the road, not knowing what to do, and the environment it is in is also one where there are thorns in front and jackals behind.</p>
<p>Therefore, these good-for-nothing fellows deeply sigh and think that "it is against heavenly principles if China does not perish." Is it really necessary for China to perish? Even if it is a lamb, even if it is a lost lamb.</p>
<p>I heard a story when I was a child: it said that a group of sheep were leisurely grazing on a vast grassland. A wolf came from afar. When the shepherd saw the wolf, before the wolf got close, he was already scared out of his wits and ran away to who knows where. All that was left was this group of sheep known for their docility.</p>
<p>But after the wolf came, it did not dare to take any action against this group of sheep, because it knew that although sheep were known for their docility, they still had two horns. And, the sheep were in a group. When their lives were in danger, even sheep known for their docility would be sure to defend themselves. Therefore, it could only quietly wait for changes, waiting for the sheep to differentiate themselves, and then it would seize the opportunity to defeat them one by one.</p>
<p>After suffering considerable losses, the sheep understood the inevitable failure of fighting each other and that waiting for the shepherd to drive away the greedy wolf was a ridiculous fantasy. Therefore, they could only unite more closely and realize that if they did not drive away the wolf, their lives would be precarious, because at any time, the wolf could rush into their ranks and devour the fat ones at will.</p>
<p>Under the threat of the threat of life and the experience repeatedly gained from sacrifice, they thoroughly realized that there was absolutely no possibility of compromise between either not having a flock of sheep or driving away the wolf. Therefore, they prepared to sacrifice to gain freedom and gradually approached the wolf...</p>
<p>What was the result of this story? I can't remember it now. Although it seems like it was very recent.</p>
<p>Writing to this point, I suddenly remembered that today is the fourth anniversary of the January 28th Incident. On the eve of this great memorial day</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>Before, it seems that I should write some timely articles as usual. But I am leisurely telling stories here.</p>
<p>What is the point of telling and listening to stories to the facts? I really can't answer it. But this short article has already been written like this, so I am too lazy to rewrite it. Let's just make do with it.</p>
<p>As for what happened next in the story of "the Sheep"? I will tell you when I remember it. But I think that if this group of sheep really unites together and is not afraid of sacrifice, then the wolf is not difficult to defeat. The future path, with the collective efforts of the group, probably will not be lost forever. Although the shepherd has long since run away, the docile sheep seem to have lost their leader, but the masses are also the best leader.</p>
<h3 id="e211">The Night Before <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Jie</p>
<p>"Worship the gods tonight, come back a bit earlier!"</p>
<p>As Dad left for the company in the morning, Mom said this to him. This was the usual custom every year. Mom considered worshiping the gods the most important thing. She would rather go hungry herself than offend the ancestors and bodhisattvas. Dad's business had been going smoothly these past few years, all thanks to the blessings of the ancestors and bodhisattvas. Therefore, Mom wouldn't forget the first and fifteenth of each month, or any festive occasion. She was especially careful about worshiping the gods at year's end. Several days beforehand, she busied herself cleaning the house, wiping the glass windows until they shone, sealing the candlesticks with red paper, and hanging up the image of the Three Star Gods in the center of the room. The dishes and vegetables had to have auspicious names, because the year-end worship was to foretell the fortune of the coming year. It was like gambling, where one would rather go hungry, because it was the initial stake, and the year's profit was boundless.</p>
<p>They had a twelve-year-old son. Since school had let out for vacation, the son had been watching the calendar, waiting for this day to arrive. This day was his most free day. Because Mom wanted to ensure good luck, she would close her eyes and plug her ears, busy with the worship, no matter what wrong things he did. When she really couldn't stand it, she would give her son a few coins and ask him to go play in the alley.</p>
<p>She was busy going from the kitchen to the living room, and from the living room to the kitchen. Every trivial thing, such as hanging the Three Star Gods and wiping the table, she did herself. She appeared so devout. When it came to kowtowing, she murmured prayers in her mouth, only praying that her husband's business would go smoothly, that she would be healthy and nimble, and that her son would grow up to be an adult. What she hoped for was the same as every woman.</p>
<p>She busied herself from morning till night. The electric lights in the living room were lit, the Three Star Gods opened their smiling faces, holding gold ingots. The gleaming candlesticks and neatly arranged fruit platters were all placed on the table. But the most important thing—lighting the incense and candles—was done by her husband every year. She believed that a woman's hands were impure and would offend the ancestors and bodhisattvas. So, she took a breath and went to look at the alley entrance. The streets were noisy. The silver ingots in the pawnshops were hanging outside the doors. Children were squeezing in the crowd, throwing firecrackers. She pulled her son and asked if he had seen Dad. Her son opened his eyes wide and shook his head. Rickshaws stopped one after another at the alley entrance. Everyone was carrying big and small packages, but not her husband. It should be the time when the company was writing out the end-of-year bonuses.</p>
<p>Back in the living room, she slumped down. She felt a bit tired, but the bright light before her eyes symbolized the omen of wealth. She blamed her husband in her heart for not coming home earlier for the once-a-year worship. She had been busy for so many days that her hands and feet were weak. Wasn't it all for the hope that the whole family would be safe and prosperous? As she thought this, she regretted it again. Perhaps the company's business was particularly good this year, and they were too busy with closing the books these days. Her husband worked hard all year round, and it was really too hard for him. She thought about calling the company, but her son jumped in, clamoring for New Year's Eve dinner. She ignored her son and called the company. The company replied that he had already left. She then ordered her son to wait for Dad at the alley entrance and ran into the kitchen.</p>
<p>But her husband still hadn't returned. The firecrackers from the neighbors were ringing all around. It was getting late. She couldn't figure out where her husband had gone. Helpless, she urged her son to light the incense and candles. The two of them waited until the incense and candles had burned out, but there was no sign of her husband. New Year's Eve dinner was supposed to be a family reunion. They waited, waited…</p>
<p>She didn't know when, but the firecrackers rang again. The sound was strangely startling, as if every sound hit people's hearts. Mom was surprised that everything was changing today. Someone in the alley shouted the news of fighting breaking out in Zhabei. It was a bolt from the blue. Her son cried; he was hungry. Mom also cried; her husband hadn't returned…</p>
<p>One year, two years…four years. Her son was already sixteen years old!</p>
<h3 id="e212">Going Home <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Yegao</p>
<p>The city gate of Shantou City gradually shrunk and disappeared into the dust and mist of the mountain road.</p>
<p>The bamboo thickets lining both sides of the mountain road whispered quietly. There was a heavy snowfall last night. Although the wind was a little calmer now, the biting cold was deeper than before. Old Qingyuan told me with pursed lips: The small river ditches by the roadside were all frozen solid. The donkeys were tired from running, and their mouths were dry, and they didn't even have a bit of water to quench their thirst. Finally, he sighed and continued: "Such cold weather hasn't been seen in thirty years!"</p>
<p>I met Old Qingyuan last year at the Jigong Temple when I transported foreign goods to Shantou City. At that time, he was still a straightforward and cheerful middle-aged man. During the hot summer season, he would bare his upper body, wrap his head with that clump of gray and white braids, sit on the cool wind cart, raise his whip high, and yell loudly. When the donkeys folded their front hooves and clattered as they walked, he would mysteriously close his eyes slightly, lightly tap his left hand on his thigh, and hum "Mountain roads are rugged..." until the donkeys were also lulled to sleep by him, lowered their steps, and quietly stopped, staring blankly, shaking their ears. In such situations, he would often mistakenly think that his donkeys were being hindered from moving forward; but when he saw that the surroundings were still so barren and desolate, the whip would sound violently again, and the donkeys would despairingly take a step and slowly walk.</p>
<p>After entering the city and delivering the goods, Old Qingyuan drove the donkeys to load materials, entrusted someone to watch them, patted the dust off his body, and went to the Xiaodaguan Garden restaurant, ordered fifty copper coins worth of white liquor, a dime's worth of rice and vegetables, ate them, came out of the restaurant, bought a cigarette roll from Fangzhen's sundry goods stall, put it in his mouth and smoked, and wandered around the street. Finally, looking at the sun, knowing that it was almost past noon, he would go to a few familiar shops to inquire whether there were any goods worth carrying to the big city.</p>
<p>It has probably been less than a year since then, but he has aged a lot. The clump of gray and white braids on his head is almost bald, and he has lost quite a few teeth. He will never again be so excited to raise his throat and sing that "Mountain roads are rugged" tune. He is old. Time has ruthlessly stripped away everything from him.</p>
<p>Several days ago, this old donkey cart, which had not been seen for a long time, reappeared on the small streets of this mountain city, carrying a short old man, said to be the accountant of Quanxing Foreign Firm, coming to the countryside to collect debts. This accountant did not return that day. The old donkey cart couldn't find a customer and didn't go back either, staying at a small inn. As the days went by, and it was almost New Year's Eve, Old Qingyuan became anxious, and he went everywhere to inquire and solicit customers. As a result, the young boss of Taiyuanlong, the foolish Jin, the clerk of the stinky tofu shop, and I all agreed.</p>
<p>The donkey cart dragged up Jinji Ridge, going straight down along the slope. This hillside was originally covered with pine forests, but it was burned to the ground in a battle between government soldiers and bandits a few months ago. In the one hundred and fifty li distance from the big city to Shantou City, this hillside is designated as a dangerous area. In the past, naked corpses or rotten human heads often hung on the green ancient pine branches, and some passing merchants and women often disappeared here without a trace. Old Qingyuan often used a sighing tone to explain how he had seen several road merchants being tied up in strings, how several people had been killed, and finally he said:</p>
<p>"Once, I was driving a cart from Shantou City to go back to the big city. It was still early, and there wasn't a single pedestrian passing by here, but we could still clearly see the path by the faint moonlight. Under a clump of thorny ridges, we found a pool of blood. At that time, there were three of us, and we discussed how to discover this miracle. A Wenzhou handyman volunteered to take on the task of guarding the luggage and the donkey cart; so, the two of us got out of the cart and followed the bloodstains. This pine forest was originally uninhabited, so the road was winding and very difficult to walk, and the weather was dark, but we found it under a thick clump.</p>
<p>"What do you all think we found! It's shocking to say! It turned out to be a headless corpse. It was still a bit warm when touched, but the hands and feet had been cut off, leaving only a bald mass. Later, we went into the city and learned that the murdered corpse was originally a detective. Not long after, we heard that the government soldiers and bandits were fighting here, and these green pine forests were destroyed by artillery fire."</p>
<p>At this point, the donkey cart had driven down the hillside and turned onto a cobblestone road. Old Qingyuan stopped talking and pointed to a village in the distance with his whip, saying, "Wuliu Town is here!" We looked up and out of the cart canopy, and saw that the sun was about to set in the west.</p>

<p>At a certain time, a moving and sensational thing happened in the London Public Security Bureau courtroom. A person with tattered clothes and a solemn appearance came to the court for advice.</p>
<p>"Director, can I ask you a question?"</p>
<p>"As long as I can answer it."</p>
<p>"Just this one sentence: Can I still live?"</p>
<p>"Get out!"</p>

<p>"Then, what is your intention in coming here to ask such a question?"</p>
<p>"Director, I am unemployed!"</p>
<p>"What does this have to do with that question?"</p>
<p>"Director, that's the truth. I have been unemployed for two months, and it is not because of any fault of my own. The Director must have heard that there are hundreds of thousands of people like me."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, you go on."</p>
<p>"Director, I am not in any union. The Director knows that our line of work does not have a union."</p>
<p>"Not bad, not bad."</p>
<p>"Director, since three weeks ago, I have reached a dead end. I tried my best to find work, but I did not succeed."</p>
<p>"Didn't you go to the relief society in your area?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you go to the local parish authorities?"</p>
<p>"I went, Director, and I even asked the pastor. Still no result!"</p>
<p>"Don't you have any relatives or friends to help you?"</p>
<p>"Director, half of them know my situation too. The other half have been exhausted by me."</p>
<p>"You really...?"</p>
<p>"And even the money they could save has been used up by me."</p>
<p>"Do you have a wife and children?"</p>
