<h3 id="c17">蘇嘉鐵路前途之觀察 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>蘇嘉鐵路自蘇州至嘉興。凡七十五公里。於昨日開始通車。東南鐵路網中。又增一綫。而京杭之間。鐵道運輸。可减少二小時以上之時間。際此國家財政極度困難交通聯絡之需要又萬分急迫之時。此七十五公里鐵路之完成。在國防上之意義。固極顯著。在經濟上之價值。亦不能漠視。誠近來深可慶幸之一事也。</p>
<p>蘇州嘉興間鐵路之聯絡。擬議甚早。光緒年間。張季直會同德國工程司詳測該綫。認為有三大缺點。卽水口太多。妨礙太湖水利。與運河平行。商運不易發展。地形過低。挖廢民田太多。故作罷論。蘇杭甬鐵路。遂變為滬杭甬鐵路。直至民國二十二年。經淞滬戰爭之敎訓。政府乃有重修蘇嘉鐵路之議。由京滬滬杭鐵路局主持其事。二十三年春間。開始察勘去年春間。工事開始。今年四月。全綫軌道枕木。敷設竣事。前月秒則車站房屋。一切完成。</p>
<p>論者謂蘇嘉鐵路之經濟上意義。不若其國防上意義之重要。此說亦不盡然。益蘇嘉沿綫。水路公路之交通。固已甚便利。然沿途人稠物富。前途發展。仍可預期。就該路範圍以內言之。依照目前公路運輸情形。蘇州與吳江及吳江盛澤與嘉興間。旅客上下。至為擁擠。自蘇嘉鐵路通車後。至少有三分之一以上旅客。為鐵路所吸收。貨運方面。以鐵路運價不若舟楫之低廉。不易與水運相競爭。然對於大量運輸。如擇要辦理特價。亦有吸收貨運之可能也。</p>
<p>抑該路之最大經濟價值。在於聯運。蘇州嘉興為江浙交通之樞紐。而蘇嘉一路。成為京杭聯絡之捷徑。自杭州閘口至南京旅客。於該路未成之前須繞道上海北站。乘車時間為十時四十五分。此後由閘口至嘉興。經由蘇嘉鐵路至南京。約八小時三十分。卽可到達。較繞道上海者。减省二小時有餘。蓋京滬杭之綫。長五百公里。而京蘇嘉杭之錢。僅三百九十公里。其間相差百公里許。此後京閘問之客運。勢必由蘇嘉路輸送。而客貨聯運之暢旺蓋在預料之中也。</p>
<p>貨物運輸。在沿綫短程之間。因受水道之包圍。恐不易發展。然管理當局。倘能擇主要河道。互相聯運。鐵路收入。亦可增加。且該路之平望。為蘇州與湖州間航綫之中點。倘以此為水陸貨物聯運站。藉以吸收湖州一帶之貨物。則貨物之舍水路而就陸。亦為可能。總之。就經濟上觀察。蘇嘉鐵路之前途。不至如一般論者之不可樂觀。如何能善於利用。使此新完成之鐵道。獲經濟上之自供自給。則有視於管理常局之努力耳。</p>

<p>— 本報記者胡仲持　胡一臧</p>
<p>進了長崎港，我們望見岸邊種種的景物，最惹眼的是靠山的長崎造船所，有交錯的鋼骨構成的長長的造船台伸出到海面，旁邊橫着幾隻建造中的船壳。我們的船經過了那兒，就靠碼頭了。我們是到神戶去的，因為船在長崎有着四個鐘頭的停留，我們便也上了岸。我們坐了人力車到我國的領事館去，一轉彎就遠遠的望見領事館屋頂飄揚着的靑天白日旗了。領事館在出師橋附近，是一所二層的洋樓，前面有一個小院子栽種着少許的草木。門口傳達室里一個年老的日本女僕把我們的名片遞了進去，我們便在會客室和柳汝祥領事，郭建英主事會見，柳領事是廣東人在長崎任職已經多年了。我們從他那談話的神情里看得出他那爽直的性格來。他在長崎跟當地的行政長官感情很融洽。當地本要實行一種對華僑貿易商加稅的法令，因了他的疏通，就暫時擱着。我們談到日本的新聞事業，據他說，日本各大報都只能替軍部和政府說話，算不得民意的代表。九州的福岡日日新聞比較的敢說話些，對於軍部和政府的政策常有銳利的批評。他又說日本各報對於中國的內情，誤載的地方很多。他碰到日本的新聞記者來訪，往往當面批評他們對中國的認識不足。領事館主事郭君精於繪畫，數年前常給我們的報上投稿，那時順便問到上海諸友的近况。我們跟柳郭兩君談了好久，因有他客進來，便吿了別，的定旅行回來，再來訪談。</p>
<p>我們出了領事館在街上遊覽了一會，便回到船上。這船向神戶開面風景很出色。映入眼簾的大小的島嶼，全是綠油油的。那些島嶼上去，在次日早上經過了瀨戶內海。這一　的海大都是森林，間或也看得見阡陌整齊的農田。</p>
<p>下午兩點鐘，「長崎丸」到神戶靠碼頭，離長崎開出的時刻差不多是二十四小時。我們把行李交給了日本旅行社，自己挈着手提篋上岸去，走了好一段路，才到得海關。關員把我們大小的箱篋每件都兜底翻檢過，問了一番其中幾伴物品的價値，才在箱篋外面用粉紅色的粉筆寫上了OK這兩個字母。森嚴的關稅壁壘終於給我們通過了。我們這才放下了一顆心。</p>
<p>二進了西日本的門戶</p>
<p>從海關出來，我們遠遠地望見六甲山脈的翠綠的峯巒，尤其注意到諏訪山上綠林所構成的兩個圓形的標記，一是神戶的市徽。又一是鐵錨的圖案，大約象徵着國際的船舶進出的這一個世界的大港灣。我們在海關前坐上了「太克希」，（街頭待雇的汽車）到預定的一家旅館去。「太克希」最低的租費，是日金五十錢，行程超過了一定的里數，租費便照里程增加上去。我們經過了幾條寬闊整齊的市街，瞥到了許多壯麗的建築物，覺得這被稱為西日本的門戶的神戶市，在建設上很比得上我們的上海。</p>
<p>我們所住的旅館離三之宮車站不多遠，是一所純日本式的建築。門面雖不大，內部的設備倒很周全，佈置也十分精雅。我們住在樓上臨窗的一個房間。室內的裝飾，富於藝術的趣味。窗格的圖案，紙門的式樣每面都不同，可是配合得很調和。室內充滿着樸素的情調，無論地板或是木柱，都不加上一些油漆。壁間掛着一幅「天仙圖」畫有天竹和水仙。下面放着雅致的盆栽。對窗有匾額一塊，題着「茶味與禪味」，書法很不俗，署名呌自在庵。這一切的布置使我們深深地感覺到日本人的普遍的藝味趣朱。</p>

<p>昨華商證券交易所、巿況以掉期交易居多、乃有盤旋形勢、惟金融界頗有出脫、人心漸轉虛萎、更以粵當局强取中行關稅存欵、愈使多方漸起搖動、軍事上則似已接觸、二中全會之結果、大概先求對內統一、然後再行對外禦侮、是則西南為先决問題、且有復興公債折押現欵、則金融界難免有現貨流出、前途又難樂觀、昨日經過、開盤初為三十七號買進而堅穩不墜、後以四號十一及十四號等賣出丙種、而漸趨疲較、轉小一二角、收盤賣氣仍旺、而戊種仍未見跌、祇小一角而已、餘則續小二三角、甲種遠期反回上一角、全日趨勢、以戊種為最堅俏、尙好三角、丁種因三十七號之買回、亦好三角五分、餘則一致續小五分一角至二角半、九六遠期小三角、近小五分、已成倒掛、成交總數、共計四百二十六萬元、茲轉其漲跌結果、比較列表於左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>

<p>紗巿被挫、且跌風狂驟、實緣連朝猛騰後、客方現銷完全停頓，行情頗形不穩、至於外商曁廠商、鑒於實際交易不起、而標紗價高、羣向所中套賣、於是近期跌勢益烈、午後證券商將多頭巨量出籠、一般附和跟進者亦紛紛出檔、市盤乃狂瀉不支矣、此種倐升倐降、全係投機商之心神不定也、</p>

<p>本月花跌八角五</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、以美棉先漲繼回、結果小漲三至六磅音、一般預料漲風可以暫定、印棉雖漲一至二羅比、然目標注意美棉、大阪三品花跌六七角、市塲人氣和平、近期跌　角半至四角、遠期亦跌二三角、一般浮戶鑒於氣勢不佳、紛起吐出、二·三盤仍屬不振、惟新花回升一·二角、收盤陳花回好、結果陳花比上日收盤價跌二角半至　角、新花跌五分至一角、午後開盤陳花巿態轉昂、新花下落五分至角半、二三盤時平平、迨至收盤、跌風在暴、謂公債帮金融帮獲利多頭、忽來大批出籠、市盤突然下瀉、陳花敲破九元、均跌三四角、新花跌進三元關內、結果各月比上午收盤價均跌二·四·五角、査賣出永大二千擔、大昶三千六百擔、明華二千擔、明德二千擔、裕大二千擔、大孚三千一百擔、大豐二千八百擔、元　四千五百擔、益康三千擔、愼昌一千二百檐、興昌一千二百擔、澄記一千七百擔、德大一千六百擔、買進源興昌三千六百擔、信誠三千六百擔、通記六千擔、振大一千七百擔、合興四千二百擔、愼記八千擔、大昌成二千五百擔、　　二千六百擔、永昌一千二百擔、同和一千三百担、一日間最高最低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<p>昨日期麥巿面、上午開盤後、呈初平繼則逐步傾跌之象、開價時、以洋麥報價、芝加哥跌三五角左右、坎拿大跌一角零、而巿塲人心、因多空觀望、交易不多、是以各月份均多盤旋、出入甚稀、迨至下午開盤、初尙平穩、旋以行家之貨、逐步套售、因現麥不能扳高、故大部分向交易所套出、此種賣戶、彷彿認為實際、故人心大鬆、開價卽步步挫落、業中人之推測、以為粉市一轉岑寂、麥市當須帶動無疑、現麥市面、以到貨仍旺、廠胃平平、各檔喊價計小二分、開滁州麥四元五角、明光沙河集管店麥四元五角三分、竹鎭麥四元四角六分、東葛麥四元四角半、浦鎭麥四元四角二分、淮安麥四元四角八分、由阜豐去六千包、申大去三千包云、</p>

<p>宋朝自從徽欽二帝被金朝捉去了，高宗渡江，在杭州立了都城以後，北邊失去的地方，也沒有收回來，只保着半邊天下。到了理宗時候，任用賈似道這個沒用的傢伙，更把大事弄壞了。這時金朝巳經衰弱了，而在北邊的蒙古——國號元——却强盛起來，隨後金朝也被她滅了。</p>
<p>理宗死了，慶宗登基，仍然任用賈似道。慶宗五年，元朝命大將巴顏，統領大兵，來打宋朝，把　北襄陽圍了五年，賈似道不發兵去救，守將呂文煥只好降了。巴顏得了襄陽，又帶兵去取漢陽武昌，也取得了。巴顏命人守着湖北，自己同阿珠帶領人馬，駕着戰船，順流而下，來取南宋的都城杭州。</p>
<p>那時文天祥在江西文山閉戶讀書，聽得元兵順流東下，就拿忠君愛國的話頭去激動鄕里中的豪傑，起兵勤王。但是朝裏奸臣，右相陳宜中不願意文天祥到杭州來，就呌文天祥在江西南昌駐紥。不多久，元兵一路上勢如破竹，巳經殺到長江下游來了。杭州驚慌得很，又才呌文天祥帶兵到杭州來。恭宗元年八月，文天祥到了杭州，九月，降旨呌他做蘇州知府，十月十五白，文天祥到了蘇州。那時元朝的大兵巳經把常州圍了。</p>
<p>文天祥就命自己的部下朱華麻士龍帶領兩廣人馬，尹王帶領江西人馬，會同張全的淮軍，一道去救常州。</p>
<p>誰知張全是個沒有用的傢伙，又同衆將不和氣。十月二十六日，在橫林虞橋遇見元兵，大殺一陣，麻士龍陣亡了，張全不救，跑回五木。五木是朱華駐守的地方，朱華要安鹿角，挖戰壕，張全都不許。</p>
<p>二十七日，元兵殺到五木，朱華大開營門，揮動麾下的兩廣人馬，同元兵大戰。從早晨殺到午後，兩方面殺死不少的人，也沒有分出大勝敗來。元兵也退回去了。</p>
<p>到晚上，元兵繞到山背後去，攻打江西尹玉的寨子。　尹玉是江西憲司的將官，從文天祥起兵的。尹玉生性直爽，武藝高强，平時常說：「趙官家不明白，聽信秦檜，把岳武穆王害了，弄得不能收復失地。隨後理宗皇帝又用了賈似道這奸賊，把國家大事越弄越糟。不用忠肝義胆的人，國家如何弄得好。我尹玉一身硬骨，學成全身武藝，一有機會，一定報效國家。」</p>
<p>俟後，尹玉聽得文天祥在江西吉州起兵勤王，不覺大喜，說：「文公是好男子，他現在起兵救國，我尹玉這身骨頭，這身武藝，不賣給文公還賣給誰去？」</p>
<p>於楚，尹玉辭別了自己的家，匹馬單槍，到吉州投文天祥去了。</p>
<p>文天祥看見尹玉像貌堂堂，威風凛凛，很喜歡他。但文天祥還信不過尹玉的心，用話試探他道：「元兵勢大，我們起兵去勤王，未見得成功，也許打個大敗仗，丟掉自己的性命。將軍，這是危險的事，你須要三思。」</p>
<p>尹玉大聲說：「文公，休要小覷了尹玉，大丈夫不建功立業，拿這條有用的身子去報效國家，難道守着老婆過一輩子不成！尹玉這次來，巳經沒有把生死和當成一件事，生和死公在一處便了。我們為的是國家！」</p>
<p>文天祥聽了，大喜，撫着尹玉的背說：「將軍眞是忠義之士！」</p>
<p>在南昌，尹玉隨着文天祥，在杭州，尹玉也隨着文天祥，在蘇州，尹玉也隨着文天祥。</p>
<p>這天奉着文天祥的令箭，同朱華一道去救常州。朱華在五木大路上安下大營，尹玉便在山背後要道上結下寨子。</p>
<p>恭宗元年十月二十七日，元兵殺到五木，同朱華大戰的時候，尹玉本想揮兵來救，無奈山後這條路十分重要，不敢擅離汛地。萬一有失，怎生得了！急得尹玉在馬上磨拳擦掌，咬牙切囓，橫着槍，眼看着山前的征塵滾滾，耳聽得山前的喊聲震地。這日子呌尹玉眞不好過。</p>
<p>午後，元兵退了，朱華收兵回營，尹玉也鬆了一口氣。但是尹玉仍然不敢大意，便下令道：「敵兵雖然是北方人，但是用起兵來仍然是一樣的狡猾。今天他們雖然退了，未見得不再來，在夜裏更要小心。今天晚上，人不許卸甲，馬不許摘鞍，小心防守。」</p>
<p>果不出尹玉所料。當天晚上，元兵把十萬大兵分成兩路，一路殺奔五木大路上朱華的大營，一路殺奔山後要隘，來取尹玉的營寨，使宋兵首尾不能相顧。</p>
<p>尹玉正在中軍帳裏，牛燭底下觀書，聽得遠遠人喊馬嘶，知道元兵前來刦寨，同時伏路小校也來報吿，元兵來刦營了。幸好人沒有卸甲，馬沒有摘鞍，尹玉一聲令下，全營都起，大開營門。尹玉縱馬挺槍，衝出營門，迎着元兵。</p>
<p>那五萬元兵，打着燈籠火把，照得如同白晝，漫山遍野，捲地殺來。這種聲勢，胆小的人看見了，沒有不心驚胆戰的。所以，還沒有交鋒，曾同，胡遇，謝雲，曾玉這幾個營頭也潰散了，張全的大軍也跑了，朱華這支人馬又被元兵隔着，救援不得，只剩下尹玉同他部下五百人馬，迎着這漫山遍野的五萬元兵。</p>
<p>尹玉看見幾個營頭散了，咬牙切齒的駡道：「這些貪生怕死的像伙！」又向這五百人馬說：「諸位是我的好兄弟，好朋友，一向都和我同心合意的。今天正是我們報國的好機會！兄弟們，我們就殺到剩下一個，也要同敵人打仗。我們殺一個敵人够本，殺兩個便賺錢了。兄弟們，用心吧！」</p>
<p>五百人馬齊聲答道：「生死同將軍在一塊！」</p>
<p>尹玉大呌道：「好！眞長尹玉的好兄弟們！好！我們衝上前去！」</p>
<p>五百人齊聲大喊，催動戰馬，如旋風一般，向元兵衝去。尹玉一馬當先，槍起處，便挑了幾個元兵下馬。像火雲一般，這五百人馬便捲進元兵陣裏去了。</p>
<p>巴顏正在中軍督陣，看見前軍催動，紛紛向兩面閃開，趕忙催馬去看。看見一員宋將，幾百宋兵，如一羣猛虎，在陣裏左衝右突，如入無人之境。</p>
<p>巴顏大驚，趕忙橫着大刀，催馬迎上前去，大呌道：「陣裏的南朝將軍且住。你瞧我大元五萬大兵在這裏，山前還有五萬大兵，團團圍住著。將軍，你幾百人馬，濟得甚事？不如下馬歸順了大元，得了南朝天下，裂土封侯，少不了你的。將軍你意下怎樣？」</p>
<p>尹玉聽了，大駡道：「哇賤狗，住口！我生是宋朝人，死是宋朝鬼！我就戰死沙塲，也不能降。賤狗，你休道我人少，我這五百人馬也要殺你個人仰馬翻。」</p>
<p>尹玉說完，挺着槍直衝過來。巴顏回馬略退，把令旗揮動，五萬人馬越圍越緊。尹玉殺不得巴顏，只好同五百人馬在元陣中混戰。元兵越來越多，尹玉也越殺越勇，一直殺到半夜。</p>
<p>尹玉看看部下人馬漸漸少了自己同坐下馬都帶了不少的傷，盔甲被血染透了，馬也是一身血。但是尹玉私毫沒有退心，仍然竭力打仗。尹玉殺到後來，力盡了，支持不住，自己知道不好，便呌道：「大宋的列祖列宗，文公，尹玉力盡了，……」話沒有說完，便口吐鮮血，倒撞下馬！</p>
<p>尹玉死了，他部下的殘餘人馬仍然死戰，殺到天亮，殺得元兵屍橫遍野，血流成河。這五百人馬也只剩下四個人回去，沒有一個投降的。五木這一仗，眞駭破了元兵的胆。</p>
<h3 id="c196">達爾文和他的進化論 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— 果軒</p>
<p>（Charles　Darwin　1809——1882）</p>
<p>在舊的聖經創世紀的第一章裏就記載着上帝造人的故事。他說，上帝先造了日月星辰山水草木，最後才搏黃土為人，這人是男的，名呌亞當，亞當又取下一條肋骨，變成一個女的，名呌夏娃，亞當夏娃就是我們人類的始祖了。這種話在過去時代裏是人人承認的，從不敢加以非難。我們中國也有着黃土造人的傳說，而最古的帝王——盤古氏，據說他是像鷄卵一般生於天地之中的。這許多人類起源的說法，到現在我們都認為荒謬不經了，何以呢？就是因為有了達爾文的進化論學說代替了他。</p>
<p>達爾文講進化學說的書名呌『物種原始』，這書百餘年來，已成世界上人人知名的傑作，我們中國也有幾種的譯本。進化論的要點在把神造萬物說打翻，並否認萬物一成不變的理論，他說一切東西都是由簡單的生物進化到高等一些的，所以一切種子都在隨時變化着，古代所說那種各種生物的祖先與現在的情形並沒有變異的學說是不對的，換句話說，就是古代任何生物也許都和目前不一樣，證據就是我們發現了許多稀奇古怪古代生骨骸所成的化石，（這種動物在目前的世界裏是找不出的。）和許多生物界變種的事實。至於我們人呢，自然也是由別種動物進化而來，不過他已進化到目前最高的階段就是了。我們知道猿猴的生活，習慣，生理搆造智力，最與人相近的，所以我們可以斷定人是由猿進化而來，而猿呢，又從別種哺乳類的動物進化而來，如此推下去，一直可以推到最簡單的單細胞生物，如原形虫之類。細胞是搆成生物的最呌他做一個敎堂的職員，但他的兒子却一意的想研究博物，恰好這時有一隻名呌卑哥爾Bengle號的船要作長期航行，他就想搭這隻船到各處遊歷並採集標本，他要求他父親允許他的請求，但他却拒絕了他，為了外國也和中國似的，車船店脚，沒一好人，他父親唯恐他學壞了；不過禁不住達爾文苦苦要求；才答應他如果有一個正派入和他作伴的話，便可允許；達爾文又去央求他的叔叔，因為他叔叔是頂得他父親信任的；恰好平時他叔叔對達爾文的像貌很器重，以為他侄兒長了一頭出衆的鼻子，來日大有飛黃騰達之望，故一經央求，立刻允許，而達爾文就在鼻子相助之下，實現了他的志願，成了世界偉人，所以後來他常向人說他一生的事業是全靠這不平凡的鼻子成功的。</p>
<p>六年的航行期中他到處調査各地的動植物地質等，時時留心生物的變種，因而對於神造萬物說大大起了疑惑。歸國後，他就開始想他的自然淘汰的道理，並隨時搜尋例證。這時他已結了婚，遷到肯特省Kent陀尼Downe地方，尋一個僻靜的古屋，專門來實騐研究。這時，他特別留心考査家禽，鴿子，狗，菓樹，蜜蜂，花草的變種和生活。</p>
<p>他著作是極小心的故他雖有成竹在胸，並未發表，不期到了一八五八年英國大探險家瓦萊斯Wallace也和他一般，開始在馬來半島研究生物進化和自然淘汰的事實，他把研究的結果，寫成一篇論文，送給達爾文，請他代為訂正發表，達爾文看見自己的學說被別人搶了先，非常驚訝，但他是個公正而有度量的人，絕不和別人爭功，就把這稿子送到當時研究科學最著名的林尼安學會Linnacan　Socieyt去，</p>
<p>生物的種類盈千累萬，卽以魚類而論，每一頭魚一次產卵可達數十萬粒，但却從不見海裏被魚塡滿，推而至於陸地上的生物也是一樣，古往今來，並未見總數若何顯著增加，其原因就在自然的環境有時給生物以種種打擊，使他不適於生存，於是只好滅絕。卽如古代每多極犬的動物，而今則絕無僅有了，有人說鯨魚也是曾生於陸上的大型動物，因為陸上覓食困難，只好「下海」，所以直到今日，還是用肺呼吸。然則可知一切能傳種的生物一定是最能適應自然環境的東西，面且也是競爭力强的分子。這樣，故一種動物往往和他的祖先完全變種，也就是生物進化的原因之一了。達爾文稱這種變化為「天然淘汰」。</p>
<p>人旣是生物之一，當然脫不了「淘汰」的「揚棄作用」。非洲黑人，南美紅人，而今世界上已竟完全成了白種人的奴隸，卽我們黃種人，若都像我們中國民族這般不爭氣，怕也早被淘汰無餘了——達爾文的學說，可以說建設了近代人類思想的基礎，於文明的推進上不無功勞，雖然在當時宗敎家和舊派生物學家極端反對他這種人猿同祖的「異說」以為歪纏，但終於達爾文得了最後的勝利。只是，近來帝國主義者的侵略雄心，也未始不是由於這種生存競爭的學說刺激起來的，因而近代的哲學者對達爾文大表不滿，又有克魯泡特金的「互助論」出來，給達爾文的進化論以一個强烈的打擊（容我們下决再談這一問題。）</p>
<p>達爾文生物學的怪傑，近代思想的支撑者，於一八〇九年二月生於英國的史魯司伯來Shrewsbury，他父親是醫生，常達爾文幼年時，他想小個體，單細胞的生物就是只有一個細胞的小東西，幾乎不是人目所能見到的，請想，說我們人類由這東西變來，豈不是驚人的奇論？但你莫以為奇，這却是千眞萬確的，因為達爾文從動植物的變化上給你找出許多證據，使你不能不信！而且這種變化，時間往柱非常之長，卽如自猿類進到人類，中間不知還要經過多少階段，每一階段往往就是幾萬年，若拿我們人事的變遷來作比例，那簡直看不出一切東西在那裏進化，因為他太慢了。那麽一切生物為什麼要變呢？說一句簡單話，就是為了適應環境的緣故。達爾文在這一點的發現上，的確是否稱讚的，他並供給我們豐富的例子作蹬。我們在這兒先舉幾件最顯明的生物進化的證據：</p>
<p>第一件，是解剖學上的證據，當我們解剖一個人或其他動物時，常常發現無用的退化的器官，如人和猩猩的「肓腸」，這種東西不特一點用處沒有，且時常引起「肓腸炎」的險症，假使人是上帝所造的話，何必要這種沒用的器官呢？但若觀察兎子一類東西，他們的肓腸就很發達，而且也很有用，於是我們就可以知道人猿都曾經過兎子的階段，等到後來他的環境改換了，生活改換了，用不到肓腸了，他就慢慢退化，而成現今的形狀，若干年之後，我們幾乎可以斷定人類不會再生肓腸的。又如人類還留着尾巴的痕迹，也是這個道理。（達爾文在人身上找出這種退化了的器官共八十餘個！）</p>
<p>第二件：是同種動物比較的事實，例如昆虫，我們都知道他該有六足四翅的，但為了生活環境不同的緣故，就生出許多變異，蝨蚤等寄生虫因根本不用飛翔，現在已經沒有了翅！蠅子的後翅也變為無有。又如昆虫的口器，因所吃的東西不同，而形狀大異，蝶的長鬚，蝗虫就沒有。但若細加考査都是一個上唇，一個下唇，一對上　，一對下顆搆成的。又如鳥類都是有翅的，但生活在沙漠中的駝鳥，因為用不到翅，故極不發達，而脚却走的異常之快。</p>
<p>第三件是發生學上的事實：普通生物，都由卵而生，人也是由母卵與精虫結合而生，故在人的胎兒進化中，顯現了一般生物進化的程序，他會有鰓，會有尾，一會象一尾魚，一會像一隻獸，這就是表示人類的祖先曾經度過這種階段。</p>
<p>第四件是由化石裏所窺見的古代生物情形，因為地球生成年代已是非常久遠，故在地表上已經有過多决的變化，研究地球的人，把地球全體從古時起依决分為原始代，古生代，中生代，新生代四大時期，再把各期別為若干紀。各紀的地層中都有那時代生物屍骸所成的化石；現在我們發現，地層越古，則所含簡單下等的動植物化石越多。原始代化石很少，只是些下等生物的；到古生代才有魚類化石，但這種魚類，和現在的魚類全然不同；中生紀便有許多兩棲類爬虫類，如蛙和蜥蜴等，至鳥類化石，則是中生代後期和新生代前期才有，這眞是生物進化鐵一般的證據呀！</p>
<p>再說，生物何以要適應環境？達爾文說出天然淘汰和人為淘汰兩個原則來；而不出「生存競爭」「適者生存」的道理。</p>
<p>人為淘汰方面他舉了許多人類飼養生物的變種為例，最有名的，是家鴿的變種：鴿的變種，因人的需要，有突胸的，有孔雀尾的，有眼睛上生肉球的，這都是人類利用生物固有變異性，選擇那種合乎他們目的的種子讓他子孫繁殖下去，這樣過了長久的時間，就漸决弄成各式各樣的變種了。這就呌人為淘汰。（你可以明白北平中山公園的金魚為什麼有那麼些新奇樣子了吧？）打算在該會的會誌上發表。恰好那會裏的幹事拉愛爾（Sir　S．Lyell）胡克爾（Hooker）早已知達爾文對這問題深有研究，就勸他把意見也寫成一篇短論，在當年七月的身誌上同時刊出。一八五九年十一月，達爾文又補充了許多意見，作成一冊書，這就是現在人人誦讀的物種原始。</p>
<p>瓦萊斯知道了自己立說雖與達氏相同，但達氏的研究在前，且論據豐富，思想深遠，情願把這筆功勞讓給達爾文，他甚至自論他自己的著作是「達爾文主義」。這種謙讓的美德，在而今科學界中，還傳為美談，比起那種東抄西掠而冒為已見的學者，强的不知多少倍了</p>
<p>敎會裏起初是非常反對達爾文的，但後來也就無聲無臭的算了。</p>
<p>達爾文在英國博得廣大的信仰，在世界上成了第一等的科學家和思想家，但他的研究，却直到晚年不衰。一八八二年，他在全國哀悼中死去，他的遺骸被國葬在專埋英國偉人的惠斯敏司特大寺裏。</p>

<p>— 莊心在</p>
<p>至於雜誌期刊方面，外國很多專門政治科學的雜誌，而中國却很可憐地一本也沒有。南京雖然有一個以政治評論命名的週刋，與政治月刋，但是前者實只是包含很廣泛的一般時論式的刊物，而後者更感穉弱膚淺，天津南開大學出有一本政治經濟學報，內容比較精實，但不免有畸重經濟之嫌，已經有人論及。所以我們要讀政治科學方面的論文，只能於較有硏究性的一般雜誌中求之。上海的東方雜誌，文化建設月刊；天津的國聞週報；武漢的武漢大學社會科學季刊：南京的中央大學社會科學季刊，都是時常有較為健全精審的政治論著刊載，為硏究政治學者所當特別重視的。此外性質比較專門的有行政效率半月刊是一個很有意義的新出版物，至於國際政治方面的雜誌，在中國却多得有些濫了。</p>
<p>一國政治科學的發達，和一國實際政治的進步，成着正比例。談政治的安全健實，總該推許英國。政治科學之盛，也正以英國為最。中國辛亥革命以來，讀政治學科的人，實繁有徒，現代產業科學發達，政治漸為流俗所鄙薄，甚至有人以治政治者過多為病，而且竟有暫停法政一門院系招收新生的主張，而不知中國政治學方面，還沒苦其幼稚！實際上旣未造成一個政治學者，更找不到一本「中國的」政治新著，政治學在中國只有日見銷沉，而中國的政治也因而未能見昌明旺盛的機運。所以要中國的政治走上軌道，使中國成為一個有組織的現代式國家，只能够進益求精，而决不可因噎廢食。除了對向為人所鄙夷不屑的「政治」，與以重新估價，俾國民對政治有新的正確的認識而外，正應該發揚政治科學的深邃研究，提高政治方面出版物的質量，培養新中國的政治家。造成富有新政治常識，習慣新政治訓練的國民，培植專門敎養的新政治家，實是中國實際政治推進的根本要圖。</p>
<h3 id="c198">介紹『越風』 <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 抱冰</p>
<p>是値得正視的刋物</p>
<p>在翻印古書，以及用色情文宇，人體模特兒的照片來誘惑讀者的出版界，如果我們要想買本意識嚴謹，思想正確的雜誌來讀讀，那翻遍幾千種刋物，像『越風』那樣作風，可以說不大多見。這原因，一半當歸罪於出版界的負不起改進文化的責任，一半當歸罪於讀者的缺乏鑑別力，故而造成了一個『惟利是圖，粗造濫製』的局面</p>
<p>『越風』雜誌，是在杭州仁和路越風社出版的半月刋，從創刋號出版到現在，共出十四期，編者是一位杭州敎育廳的勤務工人黃萍蓀，他們的標語是：『不以幽默惑世，不以異說鳴高』，以新的思想和筆調來整理史實與地方文獻；同時，注重於民族意識的醒覺工作，希望在這國難嚴重的現在，藉文字的力量來振作士氣。</p>
<p>這本刋物裏面的作者，大都均屬現今中國文壇上的知名之士，如周作人嚴旣澄高越天金梁邵元冲陳布雷徐一士郁達夫葉紹鈞夏丐尊柳亞子等，而所寫的作品，也側重於描寫史實方面的多，因此，『越風』自出版以來，據調査，經編者與作者的努力，已銷行八千餘冊，自然得到了不少讀者的好評。因為這裏面有許多寳貴的史料而向來未經發掘者，現在，經過了『越風』作者的縝密整理，參以作者個人的識見與批判，便成了一本很為時代所需要的，富於刺激力的刋物！</p>
<p>雖然『越風』的作者在文宇的描寫方面有些地方是太古舊，叙事紀人，常以文言出之，為一班對於舊文學無修養的讀者所不便，但是從意識嚴謹與夫思想正確的立塲上看來，在近來的出版物裏面，是可謂値得正視的一種刋物。</p>

<p>科學進步，一日千里，於醫學亦然，尤其淋病一症，近頃更有新發見，考淋菌本一狡猾而善奔竄之微生物，一着人體，一如水銀泄地，無孔不入。以致症狀險惡，根治為難。若用殺菌力過强之劑，則多傷害健全組織，反予淋菌，以可乘之機，蓋許多殺菌藥，僅能在某一部發生作用而不及他處也。若殺菌力輕微，則殊難動淋菌之毫末。反而擴張其勢力而蔓延各部。且許多治淋藥服後往往作嘔，食欲减退，尤為不合理之至。</p>
<p>惟彼得氏所發明之「克淋儂」一藥，可稱最合理之淋藥，因「克淋儂」之原料，係用提凈副作用之殺菌抗毒劑所組合成功，服後能於最短期中在體內發生抗淋免疫作用，並能直搗菌巢，毫不損傷其他組織。故不論淋菌流竄體內任何部分，「克淋儂」均有包圍擒殺此菌，使無漏網之效。故此藥能獨步醫林，馳譽世界也。凡攝護腺炎，前後尿道炎，睪丸炎等之局部淋病，及關節炎，骨膜炎等之全身傳染。以及婦女淋毒性白帶，炎，子宮炎，卵巢炎等，服「克淋儂」後，悉能克奏奇功。且因此藥殺菌功之全到，故無遺毒再發之事。尤為其他藥品所難企及也。</p>

<p>兩性發育不全之象微，為身體瘦矮，面容憔悴，肌肉乾萎甲錯，（卽魚鱗狀）不僅失其體健，子嗣亦因而絕望，考其原因，多由少年時誤犯手淫，斵喪內分泌而起，故雖値壯歲，頹憊有如老年，又婚後房事過度，均能致內分泌機能不足，而使神經衰弱，記憶力不良，心思呆鈍，精神恍惚，失眠頭痛，在男子則遺精，下部不能發育，女子則月經不調，久婚無孕，白帶淋漓，而使男女兩性幸福，完全斷送，社會之安寗，國家之基礎，胥被動搖。</p>
<p>對於此病之治療，近頃盛行內分泌療法，惟其效果，皆不圓滿，據各國醫家實騐之報吿，以梅倫博士發明之男用「補體康」，女用「補女容」二藥，功效最速，共原料係採自勇壯之動物睪丸與卯巢之荷爾蒙，以科學方法造成之。對於男女兩性發育不全等病，最能旺盛內分泌機能，而促生殖細胞之代謝加盛。以助長發育，化腐朽為靑年，他如遺精，早淋漏，心悸，作事無力，行動不能活潑，髮白面色蒼黃，皺紋滿額，無不於服後數星期內治愈之，在婦女則月經困難，乳房臀部發育不全等，亦因有刺戟卵泡及促增新細胞而完全治愈之。故歐美各國，對於此藥，均甚暢行。良以此二藥效力充實迅速持久，毫無副作用故也。</p>

<p>所謂易於忽略之攝護腺炎，是淋菌侵入攝護腺而起之症。初時患者，因其病狀不十分痛苦，故最易忽略而不醫治。然隨後即有漸覺排尿困難。頻發尿意，在放尿時其尿道灼痛。尿甚細短，其肛門之前部，亦發生腫脹，此時患者因感到上項各種痛苦。所以始注意而醫治，如能予以合理之治療，均可在短期內完全治愈之。</p>
<p>然若在急性淋病時未能加意治療，上項種種痛苦之症漸决消滅。尿液亦漸澄淸，由澄淸而至完全透明，此時患者，即以為自己淋病完全自愈。於是一切行動與平時無異。結果每為再發之根。久之即釀成攝護腺漏之症。致影響於生育問題，是誠淋病中大可注意之症狀也。原來淋病之尿液透明，本不能作淋病根治之證據，因淋菌潛伏攝護腺中，雖在晨第一次之放尿亦無淋系蹤跡，因肉眼不易觀察也，若用顯微鏡檢査，卽可窺見，然患者往往因此而忽之，對於此病之治療，不可專恃單純之治療，最佳可用攝護腺按摩，及電療，同時可內服克淋特效藥，以殺菌消炎，而恢復其正態。恒可於最短期間，根本治愈。惟此病最易傳染妻子，因而變為淋毒性白帶，亦宜內服克淋特效藥，外用陰道片為坐藥，亦無不迅獲治愈。</p>

<p>肺病之强壯療</p>
<p>對於肺病之療法，近世紀以來，大見進步各種內服或注射新製劑之發賣，層出不窮，藥物療法中，以沃度劑柳楊酸鈣等，較為賞用。然對於病之吸收，營養之增進，體質之改善，欲求完美而無缺者，則選擇殊為不易。蓋一般所謂新藥品者，均不過奏一部分之效力，如鎭咳除痰，增進食慾等，或止血退熱，取效於一時，只將臨床的症狀减輕而已。是均屬對症的而非根治者也。</p>
<p>惟肺病患者，無論得病之久暫，其原因則多為體力之衰减，故結核菌得以乘機勃發，而治療之道，宜以强壯全身及肺組織的抵抗力為準則。</p>
<p>乃經多數之試騐與實騐，卒採取動植礦物體中之各種强壯成分，而製為「補肺拿爾」一藥，其功能善恢復肺臟之組織，及昂盛結核病灶周圍之白血球喰菌力，則病原自歸消滅，確奏根治，性純而效偉？其强壯滋補之力，天熱服之亦無碍。擅療肺癆咳血咳嗽？痰液稠厚，胸痛盜汗，潮熱身羸。又能弭止氣管之痙變與炎症，凡哮喘久咳，小兒百口咳？傷風，多痰等，服後無不獲癒。惟肺病多併發腦神經衰弱，失眠心悸等，在女子即有月經不調，而男子則有遺精等症，可分別兼以「補女容」與「補肺拿爾」進服，以調經健體。或兼服男用「補體康」以補腦生精，由是而體力大旺？枯楊生秭，實一理想與實騐合成之療法也。</p>

<p>— 戴德醫師</p>
<p>本來以前治療淋病，多採用注射一法。至於外科上則有電療及器械等療法。但因注射之藥，每難如期奏效，且患者亦不耐長時期之注射，故殊不普及。嗣透膜殺菌療法之義倡，而用於外治上為效亦暫，蓋此不過局部之治療，不能根除體內之毒藥也。近世又盛行色素製劑，收功雖佳，苟其提煉不純，則為害殊烈，故用時須先行科學手續的消毒。顧色素劑在各種淋藥中，確為比較具有效騐者。</p>
<p>對於色素之提煉，必須應用最新科學之方法，去其品料之粗陋，而取其質地之精純，則效力必彰，副作用可免，</p>
<p>自Spiethoff氏之硏究後，遂更以色素配製共他消炎鎭痛之品，及動植物之類脂質，而由彼得氏祖述師法，製成淋病聖藥「克淋儂」，此即近世盛行各國間，最新改良之非特異性療法是也。對於治療淋病，確收臨床上空前之佳成績，如急性尿道炎，全身性淋毒關節炎症，及慢性之男子攝護腺，膀胱，睪丸等炎症。女子陰門，膣道，子宮淋等，無不奏效切實，而於短時日內徹底斷根。終身無復發之虞。但購時勿輕信他入朦混，而誤購廉價雜牌劣藥，致於服後起生命危險。必須認明眞正「克淋儂」三字為要！因本藥不但效宏質純，蓋毫無敗胃及任何副作用，功擅增加體內之抗毒力，以發生自然的抗淋滅菌機能也！</p>

<p>— 戴德醫師</p>
<p>吾人値天氣炎熱之時，因氣溫增高，致生理的機能發生各種適應，以謀健康之維持。倘此種適應機能發生障碍，身體卽感不適。其症候如食慾不振，精神倦怠，懶于作業，心胸苦悶，四肢無力，體重减輕等，往住引起慢性消化不良之轉歸。有許多慢性胃腸病，皆山夏天得來，卽其顯例。又夏日食物者不小心，多易致急性之腸胃加答兒，嘔吐下痢，復行徹底根治為要。其療法據醫師臨床之經騐，最賞用「强胃精」一藥。按木藥之藥理作用，對于生理無害，一方面賦活其細胞活力，亢進其防禦機能，則　夏由是而除，體力恢復，食慾銳增，精神活潑。</p>
<p>至若急性腸胃病之嘔吐下痢，須行內部之消毒防腐，排除其醱酵物，「强胃精」旣因所含酵　，具有此等效力，故服之卽愈，而共輔導消化，增加榮養，則允善治慢性胃病之噯氣吐酸，嘈雜胸悶，食慾减退，嘔吐胃痛，食後膨脹等。而腸病之大便秘結，糞　，洩瀉腸癆及小兒吐乳綠便，皆有卓效。因其具有脚氣病所缺乏之維他命B，故又治脚氣症而有殊功。</p>

<p>遺精病之原因，多由射精中樞過敏。共因神經上之刺激者，則有艷夢頻來，恍惚間遺精遂起。亦有全然不覺而遺精者，多係精阜及輸精管鬆馳，患者每有精液漏，遇用力或大小便時卽涓流點滴，但原因亦有根于攝護腺漏而來。</p>
<p>治療可行陰部冷水摩擦，避免刺激之談話與淫書等。內服鎭靜神經及改造性組織之藥，自然可獲全效。耐氏「育精片」即具上述諸效，故治遺精精漏，白晝滑洩等症，及眩暈健忘，染有手淫惡癖者，皆能全部根除，實最有實際效騐之專治遺精藥也！</p>

<p>七年之淋</p>
<p>患者周叙齋君，七年前已患淋病，雖屢經醫治，而功效未彰，以致纏綿未愈，猶幸尙稍知攝生，未變其他凶惡症狀。然已尿道時覺灼痛·排尿困難，而淋絲甚多，肛門會陰，悉覺木鈍之感，小便時有精液先行冲出。而便後却又見紅。此蓋將成攝護腺漏之症。嗣山友介紹其至姚菊巖醫師處治療，經姚醫師行電療等法後，即另服「克淋濃」一藥，以消炎殺菌，利尿澄淋，聞服至四五星期左右，即奏效根治。惟其夫人已染白帶多年，亦經外用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」，以除帶，內服「克淋濃」以淸淋。未幾亦獲全效。</p>
<p>淋病體虛</p>
<p>患者繆南山君，未婚體素弱而多病，後復染淋病，益困頓異常，其淋病初本為攝護腺炎，後又變為睪丸炎及精囊炎，遺精頻作，精中見血，以顯微鏡窺之，見其中有無數膿球及淋菌，繆君大為駭愕，經多方醫治，時愈時發，而病根更深，後始至戴德醫師處治療，略行手術外，同時囑服「克淋濃」以治淋，「補體康」以强化生殖系組織而治其遺精。月餘，淋病已去，遺精亦愈，調養半年，體格强壯逾恒，儼然一偉丈夫，嗣由王君撮合，與其女士結婚，旋舉一男，伉儷篤好不渝云。</p>
<p>淋濁忽起</p>
<p>患者黃鳳鳴君，於月前涉足花叢，沾染淋病，數日後尿道痛癢交幷，淋濁流溢，小便困難，尿如茶綠之色，龜頭紅腫，包皮亦翻轉不下，痛楚之狀，難以言罄，幸經陳少華醫師示服「古淋濃」約三瓶，淋濁即减，放尿較暢，乃安心自行續服二瓶，以防復發，遂吿根治，尿液澄淸，痛苦盡矣，經血淸檢騐，確證斷根云。</p>
<p>睪丸腫硬</p>
<p>患者范綱君，患淋已有數年，迭治不愈，每晨有粘性之濁液封住尿道，小便中時夾血絲，或呈混濁狀。睪丸腫大，行動拘痛，經鄧源和醫師診為畢丸炎，投服「克淋濃」除淋抗菌，並服「補體康」行內分泌治療，以消睪腫，未及匝月，即吿全部治愈云。</p>

<h3 id="c208">淸代詞學略述 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— 似茲</p>
<p>詞是兩宋的時代文學，猶之唐代的詩和元代的曲。詞到元明，衰落極了。雖則做詞的人始終不絕，但是他們才氣平庸。毫沒有傑出之作。蓋元明正當兩宋之後，詞巳經發展到頂點了，所謂極盛之下難為繼，他們自然不能怎樣的再發展下去了。</p>
<p>但是到了淸代，則又「剝極而復」，極盛一時，文學史家稱之為「復興時代」。劉子庚先生在他的詞史裏有過下面的幾句話：</p>
<p>「詞者詩之餘，句萌於隋，發育於唐，敷舒於五代，茂盛於北宋，煊燦於南宋，翦伐於金，散漫於明，灌溉於淸初，收穫於乾嘉之際。」</p>
<p>這是說得最明暢不過的。</p>
<p>現在讓我們來把有淸一代的詞學，作一個概括的叙述。</p>
<p>淸初的詞人，還是免不了明人的習氣，都宗唐五代，以花間集和草堂詩餘為模範。因此做出來的詞，淫濫鄙俗，不堪入目。到朱彝尊起來，一變作風，改宗南宋，奉姜白石張玉田為圭臬，形成後來「浙西塡詞者，家白石而戶玉田」的風氣，造成所謂「浙派」的詞。</p>
<p>說起「浙派」，我們應該從曹潔躬講起。嘉興曹溶，字潔躬，他看着靖初人詞，各以明人為法，痛心詞學失傳，乃「崇爾雅，斥淫哇」。朱彝尊力倡其說，浙派於以形成。他的詞雖不盡工，然頗得空靈之趣。至於朱彝尊，他的天分極高，故能自出機杼，盡掃陳言，其靜志居琴趣一卷，實為豓詞壓卷之作，非庸手所能望其項背者。</p>
<p>與朱同時屬於浙派者，尙有李良年·沈曍日·李符·沈岸登·龔翔麟諸家。其後則有厲鶚·郭　·王策·項鴻祚等。而厲樊榭尤為浙派的「白眉」，最為世所稱道。項鴻祚也是一個健將。</p>
<p>除了浙派以外，在淸初有吳偉業和王士禎，都是詩人而兼詞人·同時，還有幾個偉大的詞人產生，如納蘭性德，陳維崧等。納蘭的小令，悽惋不可卒讀，很像南唐後主，在淸代是沒有人能和他相比儗的。陳維崧與朱彝尊齊名，而風格却絕不相同，以雄偉豪壯勝，滿江紅·金縷曲多至百餘首，其氣魄可想而知了。又他的詞集，量亦最多，共有三十卷，古今詞人，殆無敵手。此外如曹貞吉　吳綺·顧貞觀·彭孫遹等人，亦當時大家。</p>
<p>現在我們又要回到浙派來講。派浙標舉僅及南宋，但務為綺藻韻致；及其末流，都是　　寒乞之作了。到乾嘉以後，衰頹益甚。於是張惠言張琦兄弟起而以北宋振之，尊周邦彥而抑姜張，號常州派，和浙派分道揚鑣。他們的詞以沈著寄託兩方面發揮詞旨。董士錫·周濟等都是常州派的後勁。常州派的詞，遂支配了當時的整個詞壇。</p>
<p>當常州派詞盛行的時候，有一個蔣春霖，不傍門戶，獨以風雅為宗。他富有才氣。生當太平天國之世，因此其詞醇雅哀怨，渾成自然。論者謂為有淸一代之冠，洵非虛語。此外若周之琦·莊棫·譚廷獻等亦均能手。</p>
<p>到了淸末，則王鵬運·鄭文焯·朱祖謀·況周頥諸人，並稱健將。王雖為廣西人，實承常州派的系統，他的論詞，別標「重」「拙」「大」三大宗旨，他自己的作品，也確能秉此標的而力赴之。文焯為詞，守律甚嚴，而蕭疏俊逸之氣，却始終不為所掩。朱詞自夢窗入「幽憂怨非」，沈抑緜邈，莫可端倪」。（陳三立語）周顧則偏於凄豓一路，與王朱異趣。</p>
<p>有淸二百八十年詞學大概俱如上述。至於詞家之數，則據淸詞綜（王昶編，至嘉慶初年止），淸詞綜二編（王紹成編，至道光止），淸詞綜續編（黃憲淸編，至同治末年止），淸詞綜補編（丁紹儀編，至淸代亡止）四　所載，合計之共三千人。這個數目是不能算少了。詞集之數，當然也有這麽許多。不過這些詞集，都是單卷孤帙，從來沒有合刋的。因此我們若要硏究淸詞，或者欣賞淸詞，除了依據有主觀色彩的選本外，就很難着手了。</p>
<p>現在開明書發印了陳乃乾先生校輯的「淸名家詞」，這不能不說是一件快事。雖則所收僅百家，然而重要的詞家，已沒有什麽遺漏了。宋詞有汲古閣彙刋於前，四印齋和彊村校輯於後，洋洋大觀，讀者稱便。今淸詞得陳先生和開明書店的努力，其嘉惠士林之功，誠不可沒也。我們希望他將來能二集三集這樣繼續印下去，成一部「全淸詞」，則豈特是我們後生小子的幸羅呢！</p>
<h3 id="c209">「文藝心理學」作者自白 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— 朱光潛</p>
<p>這是一部研究文藝理論的書籍。我對於它的名稱，曾費一番躊躇。它可以呌做「美畢」，因為它所討論的問題通常都屬於美畢範圍。美學是從哲學分支出來的，巳往的美學家大半心中先存有一種哲學系統，以它為根據，演繹出一些美學原理來。本書所採的是另一種方法。它丟開一切哲學的成見，把文藝的創造和欣賞當作心理的事實去研究，從事實中歸納得一些可適用於文藝批評的原理。它的對象是文藝的創造和欣賞，它的觀點大致是心理學的，所以我不用「美學」的名目，把它呌做「文藝心理學」。這兩個名稱在現代都有人用過，分別也並不很大，我們可以說，「文藝心理學」是從心理學觀點研究出來的「美學」。</p>
<p>這部書還是我在外國當學生時代寫成的。原來預備早發表，所以朱佩弦先生的序還是民國二十一年在倫敦寫成的。後來自己覺得有些地方還待修改，一擱就擱下了四年。在這四年中我拿它做講義在淸華大學講過一年，今年又在北京大學的「詩論」課程裏擇要講了一遍。每决講演，我都把原稿更改過一次。祇就分量說，現在付印的稿子較四年前請朱佩弦先生看過的原稿已超過三分之一。第六·七·八·十·十一，諸章都完全是新添的。</p>
<p>在這新添的五章中，我對於美學的意見和四年前寫初稿時的相較，經過一個很重要的變遷。從前，我受從康德到克羅齊一線相傳的形式派美學的束縛，以為美感經騐純粹地是形相的直覺，在聚精會神中我們觀賞一個孤立絕綠的意象，不旁遷他涉，所以抽象的思考，聯想，道德觀念等等都是美感範圍以外的事。現在，我覺察人生是有機體；科學的，倫理的和美感的種種活動在理論上雖可分辨，在事實上却不可分割開來，使彼此互相絕緣。因此，我根本反對克羅齊派形式美學所根據的機械觀，和所用的抽象的分析法。這種態度的變遷我在第十一章——「克羅齊派美學的批評」——裏說得很淸楚。我兩次更改初稿，都從這個懷疑形式派的態度去糾正從前尾隨形式派所發的議論。我對於形式派美學並不敢說推倒，它所肯定的原理有許多是不可磨滅的。它的毛病在太偏，我對於它的貢獻祇是一種「補苴罅漏」。做學問持成見最誤事。有意要調和折衷，和有意要偏，同樣地是持成見。我本來沒有意要調和折衷，但是終於走到折衷的路上去，這也許是我過於謹愼，不敢輕信片面學說和片面事實的結果。</p>
<p>現在一般人對於硏究文藝理論，似乎還存有一種不應有的輕視。創作者說，「我沒有你那些文藝理論，還是能創作；你有了那些文藝理論，還是不能創作。」欣賞者說，「文藝的美妙和神秘是不能用科學方法分析的，你把它加以科學方法的分析，結果是使「七寳樓臺，拆碎不成片段。」這些話固然都「持之有故，言之成理」但是硏究文藝理論者並不必因此而消滅他的生存權。他可以作如下的辯護：</p>
<p>一切事物都有研究的價値。科學並不把世閒事物劃為「應研究」的和「不應研究」的兩種。除非是自甘愚昧，除非是强旁人跟着他自甘愚味，文藝創作者和欣賞者沒有理由菲薄旁人對於文藝作科學的活動，這就是說，根據創作和欣賞的事實，尋求關於文藝的原理。</p>
<p>一個人研究一種學問，原因不外兩種：一種是那種學問對於他有直接的實用，像兒童心理學對於敎育家；一種是它雖沒有直接的實用，而它的問題却易引起好奇心，人要硏究它，好比小孩子們要鑽進迷徑裏去尋出路，祇因為道事本身有趣。關於文藝理論的研究，我們縱退一步承認它對於創作和欣賞無實用，也不能就因此把它一筆勾消。它旣有問題，就能刺激好奇心，就能引起硏究的興趣。</p>
<p>何况文藝理論的研究對於創作和欣賞並非毫無實用哩？先就創作說，「眼高」固然有「手低」的，「眼低」而「手高」的似乎並不多見。文藝到現代大致已離開「自然流露」而進到「有意刻劃」的階段，這就是說，它已經變成有「自意識的」活動了。每個藝術家遲早都不免要思量到內容與形式，藝術與人生，寫意與寫實種種問題上去。他個人在實際經騐中所體騐得來的，像達文奇的「畫論」，哥德和愛克爾曼的「談話錄」羅丹的「藝術論」佛洛伯的「書信集」之類，固然十分可寳貴，但是每個藝術家不一定都有工夫和興趣，尤其不一定都有冷靜的分析力，去作理論的建設。如果他稍稍留心治文藝理論者所得的結果，也許對於平常自己所思量的問題不至持偏狹的，甚至於錯誤的見解。在文藝方面，錯誤的見解流弊之大，並不亞於低劣的手腕。</p>
<p>說得欣賞，文藝理論的研究簡直是不可少的。旣云欣賞，就不能不明白「價値」的標準和藝術的本質。如果你沒有决定怎樣纔是美，你就沒有理由說這幅畫比那幅畫美；如果你沒有明白藝術的本質，你就沒有理由說這件作品是藝術，那件作品不是藝術。世間固然也有許多不硏究美學而批評文藝的人們，但是他們好像水手說天文，看護婦說醫藥，全憑粗疏的經騐，沒有嚴密的有系統的學理做根據。我並不敢忽視粗疏的經騐，但是我敢說它不够用，而且有時還誤事。</p>
<p>趁這個機會，我不妨略說個人的經騐。從前我决沒有夢想到我有一天會走到美學的路上去。我前後在幾個大學裏做過十四年的學生，學過許多不相干的功課，解剖過鯊魚，製造過染色切片，讀過建築史，學過符號名學，用過薰煙鼓和電氣反應表測騐心理反應，可是我從來沒有上過一次美學課。我原來的興趣中心第一是文學，其决是心理學，第三是哲學。因為歡喜文學，我被逼到研究批評的標準，藝術與人生，藝術與自然，內容與形式，語文與思想諸問題；因為歡喜心理學，我被逼到研究想像與情感的關係，創造和欣賞的心理活動，以及趣味上的個別的差異；因為歡喜哲學，我被逼到研究康德，赫格爾和克羅齊諸人討論美學的著作。這麽一來，美舉便成為我所歡喜的幾種學問的聯絡線索了。我現在相信：研究文學，藝術，心理學和哲學的人們如果忽略美學，那是一個很大的欠缺。</p>
<p>本書附載「近代實騐美學」三篇，略述近代心理學家作美學實騐所走的路徑，所用的方法和所得的結果。這些都是乾燥的事實，但是我相信科學家最重要的訓練是學會看重乾燥的事實，和在乾燥的事實中尋出趣味，所以這三篇對於文藝心理學者或許不無裨補。</p>
<p>本書泛論文藝，我另外寫了一部「詩學」，應用本書的基本原理去討論詩的問題，同時，對於中國詩作一種學理的研究。</p>
<p>這部書的完成靠許多朋友的幫助。第一是朱佩弦先生，他在歐洲旅途匆忙中替我仔細看過原稿，做了序，還給我許多謹慎的批評。第六章「美感與聯想」就是因為他對於原稿不滿意而改作的。其决是夏丐尊先生，他在這僩書業不景氣的年頭，讓這部比較專門的書有出版的機會。最後是內子今吾，她在本書起稿時給我許多鼓勵，稿成後又辛辛苦苦地一再校正錯誤。趁這個機會，我向他們表示感謝。</p>

<p>— 淸水</p>
<p>我們很知道，關於過去的生活與故事的書籟，孩子們是很喜歡能够讀些的。因為歷史把人間隔得太久了，前此人們的想像，智慧，技能，以及所用的工具，俱皆千百倍的笨拙於今人，因之，他們的生之爭存的經過，是如此其奇誕，怪異的。我們看了，不單有些要驚慄，抑也有些看了要笑痛肚子，大呼「蠢人，蠢人！」但是，這是我們的祖先限於時代，智識，用具的種種環境所造成的必不能够獲免的過失，幷不是智慧之不若我們的。於此歷史的過程，我們實有去深體力求的必要。不獨要知其然，也要知其所當然。</p>
<p>這門功課，這種　　，從前也是有的，不過有的說的太怪誕，全把它神話化了，這於孩子是感着不足的，有的是寫得太平直了，如實的叙述，板着臉孔在說敎，晦澀難懂，簡直是讀不下去，聽了就打磕睡。因之，這門功課，道些智識，印在我們任何孩子腦子裏的印象，是如此其模糊，一出了學校門，便忘得乾乾凈凈，完全交還給敎師了。</p>
<p>這本拉蒙可夫瑪的「人類史話」（The　Child’s　Story　of　the　Human　Rece），却是一本不可多得好書，給成年人看固很適宜，給孩子看那不消說是最為有益的了。「昆蟲故事」是本好書，但它的內容是限於某一方面的。「楊柳風」是本好書，它的材料，却沒有這麼的廣博。就是說無人不知無人不讀的房龍的「人類故事」罷，書中的材料，也比不上這書的多而且新鮮。這書於人類古代的生活歷史，用藝術的手腕，淺近而又明曉的文字，寫成一本十分有趣的易於上口樂於披　的書籍。旣不是虛搆的神話，使讀者無意識的去追尋幻影的詩之樂園；又不是平鋪直叙，死蛇般的記賬書寫，而是迤邐的紆曲的用剝蕉抽繭的方法，一層層的分析出來，闡明這古代人類生活的史之推進，使讀者滿足地了解許許多多不能了解的「為什麼是這樣」？的一個重要問題。這是眞正的歷史，合乎科學要求的歷史，最足使我們去了解人們過去與現在的狀態和歷程，以及一切相互聯鎖的史之關係的。分門別段，排列有條，流水般的聯成一氣，一樣的淺顯，一樣的明曉，一樣的文字曲折叙述優美，宛如神話故事的易誦易讀，說是一本不可多得的書籍，眞是再適當也沒有的了。</p>
<p>「兒童節」來到的時候，我給幾家日報寫文，都說到這麼的一個問題。我說，『解釋人類歷史人生意義，自然現象的童話專籍，應多多的以美的文字編印或譯述下來，以給我們的孩子閱讀』。『這個年頭，兒童文學，幾乎要畢命了，我們不能創作好的童話給孩子看，那嗎，就是翻譯點像本確可給二十世紀的兒童看的讀的佳作給孩子閱讀，也是功德無量的一回事情。』（周作人先生似乎說過這樣的話）編者費了三年的時光，方編成這本大足以滿足孩子們的智識慾的好書；日本的學者鳥居龍藏譽為「不僅可作少年讀物；作為一般人的讀物，也是很有價値的」（譯者序）這話要算最為公允的了。「楊柳風」的廣吿道，『這是一本少年的書本，所以因此或者是專給少年人看，以及心裏還有少年精神存活着的人們看的。這是生命，日光，流水，樹木，塵土飛揚的道路，和冬天的爐邊之普。這與「阿麗斯漫遊奇境記」相並，成為一種古典』。我讀了這書之後，贊嘆書中寫得的輕快，優美，靈趣——尤其是頭兩三章的文字美妙，得未曾有——以為用這一段話移來相贈，才是相稱，才算得體。</p>
<p>著者的原序道：『我是快活地寫這部著作的，如果你們讀了，同樣地得到快活，這是我的幸運了。』親愛的少年們！請接受「你們的好友」的話，把他給你們寫的有生命有內容的可作精神糧食的這麼一本好書，一口氣讀下去罷！</p>

<h3 id="c211">裝話機後 <a href="#c211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— 寄觀</p>
<p>用戶應注意各點</p>
<p>電話之利益，為普通人所深知，一經裝用，隨時可以接通，無論近途長途，雙方交談，有如唔對。美國為電話最發達之國家，其人民之使用電話，視為日常生活所必需，我國雖進步遲滯，但近數年間，電話事業之發達，亦有日增月盛之勢，殊可見社會樂用之一斑。</p>
<p>話機旣裝，通話自然不成問題，然用戶亦當明曉，此一架電話機，欲保持通話，迅速通話，平時實應加以注意，斯雖普通常識，似頗値得一談。</p>
<p>（甲）裝用話機，須付保蹬金，此項保證金不啻機之代價，將來不用而拆除，話局方面，自須照數歸還，惟用戶須知話機為話局之財產，在使用期間，亦卽為甩戶之財產，平時對於機件，切應加意防護，以免遭損失而致賠償。</p>
<p>（乙）話機裝於室內，無論供諸案頭，或高懸壁上，新機初試，式樣美觀，縱屬用具，足資點綴，但使用旣久，每漸汚損，甚至機繩紐結，磁漆剝落，任其自然，不加珍惜，此使用者之過也，故用戶話機，應隨時自加整理淸拭（用乾布或帚），俾可久維不壞。</p>
<p>（丙）潮濕水氣，最易吸入話繩，影響通話，故濕布面巾以及潮潤之物，切不可任意放上話機，藉免使用不靈。</p>
<p>（丁）接話之後，須親自喚人來談者，此時聽筒不能掛上，在桌機可安放案頭，自無問題，如屬牆機，倉卒間無法掛置，往往將聽筒任其吊落，直懸機旁，如此反復為之，話繩極易損傷，如預裝一掛鈎或掛架，卽能免除此病。（磁石式話機之上蓋板邊緣，間可利用之以臨時搭掛聽筒，但亦頗易滑落。）</p>
<p>（戊）本機之電話號數，如為自動話機，則轉盤上中心圓片，淸晰載明，一望而知，惟磁石式或共電式話機，則缺焉未備，最好用戶自己書寫，黏諸機上，庶通話時，或有詢及本機號數者，或欲其打電話回覆者，臨時忘却，無須翻査。</p>
<p>（己）常須通話之各用戶，最好將其電話號數分別列成一表，懸諸機旁，俾可一覽卽得，其中並應列入救火會及該管警所之電話，蓋為防患未然，緊要時自覺便利多多也。</p>
<p>（庚）話機不靈，由話局派工來修，或租費到期，由話局派員收取，出入用戶，均佩符號或證章，茍有懷疑，自可證明，防宵小之混跡，用戶關於此點，亦應有充分之注意。</p>
<p>（辛）使用磁石式或共電式話機之用戶，對於司機人員，以為共服務不善（如不遜謾駡等事）接綫遲誤，如屬確實，固不必在機上相互爭執，發生口角，應將實在情形，曁通話日時，報吿話局。話局方面自能一査卽得，照章加司機人員以懲處。</p>
<p>裝用電話機，在話局方面，則盡量供給共通話上之便利，在用戶方面，亦無非希望其話機常能保持完善，無須時加修理，但話機旣裝於人家，卽此一部分之機械，平時之維護珍惜，完全屬諸用戶，而善為應用，亦可增加通話之速度，减除無謂之麻煩，此實雙方均有利益，深望裝機者注意及之。</p>
<h3 id="c212">電報送禮 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— 有禮</p>
<p>電報送禮，電報到，禮券亦到，送報的報差，客氣一些，同時兼做了送禮的台使，不過向來習慣，台使的力金，照送禮的厚薄，數角至數元不等，報差充台使，是絕對不能要，也絕對不能受的。</p>
<p>過去的交際電報，祗能拍發祝賀慰唁的文字，收報者得到這樣的電報，知道遠處的親友，對於其婚喪或喜慶，正在那裏表示深切的同情，在禮的方面說，所謂盡其心而已；但是社會俗尙，內心的表示，固屬重要，實物之餽送，却也未能免除，自有了電報送禮，居然心到禮亦到，精神上和物質上，受者都得到相當的安慰。增加雙方的情誼，這樣的辦法，實在是設想很周到。</p>
<p>講到送禮，就個人所感覺，很是一樁麻煩的事情，尤其是寄往遠處的？經過郵局或銀行開好匯票之後，關於慶賀或弔唁，尙須自己寫信，將匯票封入，一併掛號寄出。這一封送禮的信，或者應用「百年好合」，或者應用「節哀順變」，類此一套的辭句，儉腹的我，時常覺得「頗費周章」。現在祗須把所送禮金，交至電局，簡單的發一張電報，電文亦有電局擬就之現成字句，只要自己斟酌選用，是所費的報費有限，而所省的麻煩不少，我敢斷說，任何人都覺得便利的。</p>
<p>辦理婚喪喜慶的人們！你們不要以為你的親戚或朋友，相處很遠，對於你的事情，或者來不及送禮，或者忘却了送禮，須知電報送禮，是特別快的，當日發寄，也能如期遞到，等到報差進門，始信你的戚友，禮厚情深，非但並未失禮，且所餽送者，是一張形式莊重立可兌現的禮券！禮尙往來，確可贊一聲「交際上品」。</p>
<h3 id="c213">關於廣播電台之改進種種 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>年來我國廣播無綫電，已漸引起一般民衆之興趣，收音機之裝置，亦日見增多。聞交通部於去年年底止，計頒發收音機執照四萬二千五百六十五張，而截至本年六月中旬止，計發五萬三千六百三十四張，較去年底增加一萬一千零六十九張。此項數字，若與日本及英美諸國相較，固屬望塵莫及，然在我國草創時代，亦為極良好之現象。况事實上此項數字决有不及，良以一般裝機者之未經登記者，亦所在多有，此殆必經之階段也。</p>
<p>交部近以部辦上海北平兩廣播台之電力甚為微小，不足以充分發揮其效能。現聞决將上海原有之二百瓦特台，改為二千瓦特，北平原有之二百瓦特，改為一千瓦特。所有改裝計劃，已分令各該台議定後呈部核奪，大的此項改裝，不久郁可見諸實行。又聞對於廣播節目，積極加以改進，尤其對於敎育節目，力予充實，如延聘名人演講以及敎授各項科學，以供一般聽戶常識之增進。</p>
<p>世界運動大會，定於八月一日在德京柏林舉行，我國參加選手，均係傑出人物。交通部為提倡體育起見，業已决定辦法，將上項運動新聞，由國際電台劉行收報台接收，再用長途電話綫接至中央廣播電台，由其轉播全國。</p>
<p>交部據報吿：蘇州久大廣播電台，私自增加電力，並於胡主席展堂逝世停止娛樂期內，竟廣播廣東音樂，當經派員前往調査確實，業已處罰停播二星期，以資申誡云。</p>
<h3 id="c214">交通部規定維護長途話綫之辦法 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>交通部為增進修整電信綫路障碍效率起見，曾於上年九月規定電信綫路障碍修整辦法，凡各局處所轄綫路，應由工程師，業務長，測騐員，支局主任，或營業員，隨時注意，如遇顯著異狀發生時，並應分別檢測局內　與局外綫，如査明係局外發生障碍，立卽塡發派工單，飭工趕速査修，不得片刻遲延。至綫工修理綫路障碍，除非常災害為人力不及趕修者外，錢阻之時間，無論晝夜，不得超過下列之規定：（一）重要綫路，二十四小時：（二）次要及尋常綫路，三十小時。自此以後，修整電錢障碍之速率，增加不少。</p>
<p>今春以來，各省長途話綫工程，逐漸完成，並多開放營業，關係各方通信，至為重要。亟應認眞維護，如果綫條偶失平衡狀態，卽有感應雜音等弊病發生。通話自難淸晰。故對於電辦信綫路修整辦法，允宜切實注意，不容稍懈。</p>
<p>又各話綫之交叉位置及方法，均經適當之配置，更不容稍事變更。應卽繪具圖說，訓飭管段各工熟識所轄話綫之對數及交叉位置方法，以免發生錯誤。至錢工試錢之時，務須在裝有試錢夾之試錢桿上舉行，試畢並須將該試錢夾拭凈接妥旋緊，切勿任意割斷綫條。再各路長途話綫進局處所，交通部早有規定，其餘中間各局，一概不得任意斷綫引入，或將其他單錢聯通，以免妨碍通話。</p>
<p>上項辦法，業經飭令各電政管理局遵照辦理矣。</p>

<p>本刋特闢問答一欄，社會人士，對於電報電話收發手續及對於電信章程不明瞭之處，或對於電信常識有所垂詢時，本刊表示歡迎，具誠奉答。</p>
<p>（一）長沙柳子奇君問官軍電報收現，旣經行政院暨交通部通令實行，自應遵照辦理。惟收報人姓名住址，能否照尋常電報不滿十三字者，作三字計費可乎？</p>
<p>（答）依照國內電報營業通則第八十三條之規定，官軍電報之收報人住址及名稱，照原有字數按字計費。蓋以電報每字成本統計，恒在一角以上，官軍電報减半收費，電局巳經賠累一半，故收報人住址及名稱，不予比照尋常電報收付之例。</p>
<p>（二）南京劉楚才君問　鄙人現擬由南京發一長途電話至九江友人，商議某項要公，照官軍電報半價付費，不知可否</p>
<p>（答）查長途電話營業通則，無半價收費之規定。且且京潯長途電話，為九省長途電話幹綫之一，該項話綫工程之資本，係交通部向中英庚欵會之借欵，依照合同，由話務全部收入為第一担保。通話費須照章納費，無通融餘地，並聞行政院已通令各政軍機關　為維護矣。</p>
<p>更正：上期本刊九省長途電話京漢幹綫建設完成一文，南京到懷寗，南京到蕪湖，漢口到九江，懷寗到九江均係直接，誤刋為「由九江轉」，特此更正。</p>

<p>— 廉</p>
<p>據中華日報載：「本年五月份公共租界內，工業上及職業上發生意外事件，經向工部局報告者，計共一百七十一起，其中致命者八起，婦女受傷者八人，致命者一人：原因確知之意外事件，凡一六一起；經工部局調查及飭令採用預防方法者，一零七起。」在這可驚的數目當中，以死傷者的職業分別統計，五金機器業工人為數最多，死傷共達六十人，建築工人死傷者二十七人，紡織業工人死傷者十六人，運輸業死傷者二十一人，造紙及印刷業死傷者十五人。……依死傷的原因檢查，意外事件發生於齒輪或皮帶者十三起，發生於動力機者五十一起，發生於壓力機者十一起，發生於軋輪機者十一起。……而這些意外事件的統計、僅在五月之內，且只屬上海公共租界一隅，為數已如此驚人，苟依比例類推，其嚴重性也就可想而知。</p>
<p>我們對於這以外事件，實在不容忽視。從發生的原因中，我們至少可以肯定，預防意外的方法，設備不很健全，使工人的安全失了保障，而為了生活所驅使，又不得不勉强去幹。遂促成了意外事件的人數之增加，這實在是一個殘酷的人類的悲劇。</p>
<p>在人道和正義的立塲，我們對於工人生命的安全的保障，自不能緘默不言，雖然我們也明白知道，在這個動亂的時代，卽使如何改良，依舊不是一個澈底解決。我們想，有時卽使能夠使其嚴重性略為減輕，也未嘗不先小補的。</p>
<p>中國工人的生活之苦，已較諸歐美各國為甚，更兼以生命之絕无保障，尤為有人道正義感的人們所不忍覩。現在據五月份工部局的統計看來，工人經常受意外死傷的數目尙如此衆多，則未經發表者及旡調查統計者，當尙不止此數，是以為我國工人的前途着想，是鹰得向社會人士再三呼籲的。</p>
<h3 id="c219">愛倫羊奶塲巡禮 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 方舟</p>
<p>本報特寫</p>
<p>羊奶塲在我國，可以說是一椿新興實業；因為它的發現還不過一年以前的事。而且我最初只知上海江灣路有一個羊奶公司，直到近來我到眞如去了兩趟，才知道那裏原來也有一個愛倫羊奶塲。</p>
<p>但國人對於羊奶還很生疏，並且更不明白它和牛奶的品質有什麼分别，所以吃的人非常少，而推銷方面一時亦難以普遍。——七十羊奶事業在歐美各國及日本是差不多和牛奶實業一樣地發達了；尤其是瑞典，羊奶塲幾乎成了農村中的重要副業。所以我總想到那兒去參觀一下，順便還想將裏面的情形來介紹一點於我國關心生產事業的讀者之前。</p>
<p>昨天下午，由那輛公共汽車把我從寳山路駛到了眞如暨南大學門前；我冒着給汽車捲在空中瀰漫的塵砂，沿着那條煤屑路走去。在橋塊上，我就看見了愛倫羊奶塲和眞如鄉村敎育實騐區的指路牌；依着指示牌的方向過了橋，就是那條寬平的眞如路了。</p>
<p>過了眞茹中學，兩傍全是一片田野，田畦裏的瓜蔓花藤，荳顆棉秧，都由綠可愛地屈服在驕陽下，有些花朶却像蝴蝶似的躱在綠葉上面。雖然道傍也有幾座別墅式的洋房，和幾個小型的種植園或花圃，可是却像晨星般地稀落的。</p>
<p>有些棉田里堅有「眞茹鄉村敎育實騐區棉作示範塲」黑牌子者，便是農藝改良試騐場的特約田。</p>
<p>愛倫羊奶塲距離眞如火車站約一哩路，佔地也有十來畝，外圍以竹籬，它的隔壁也有一個農場辦事處，對面就是眞如鄉村敎育實騐區的總辦公處。</p>
<p>我走進裏面，找到了辦公室，向一位女辦事員說明瞭來意，她便派了一位管理員引導我去參觀了一遍。</p>
<p>先去參觀奶瓶銷毒室；那裏有一架洗瓶機，凡預備裝奶的空瓶，必須先在此機上洗滌過，然後再置在蒸汽箱里去消毒。這種蒸汽箱是裝在壁裏的，每箱分六屜格，每格可置空瓶六十只，共有六整蒸汽箱，每一隻箱上均装有溫度表，把洗淨的空瓶放在箱裏後，卽須將門關上，而同時將這隻箱裏的蒸汽開放。蒸汽平均的溫度是二百度至二百二十度。——而且這箱子是兩面有門的，一面在洗瓶室，一面在裝瓶室。消毒時從這裏放進去，裝奶時就在那邊取出來，手續可以說是非常的便利。</p>
<p>擠奶室是在後面；這裏也有兩間，一間是擠奶前洗滌羊身的；把羊身洗净了就擠到那一間裏去擠奶。擠奶是用人工法；他們將羊子騎在一隻木架上，人就坐牠肚下慢慢地勒擠起來。奶擠了出來，馬上要送到樓上蒸汽鍋里去消毒。那兒除了一隻很大的蒸汽鍋之外，壁上還有一隻圓形的，像掛鐘一樣的溫度表，而蒸乳所需要的溫度大約是一百四十至一百五十度。由傍邊水門汀扶梯上走下去，便是裝瓶室。這里有一座装瓶機，裝瓶機的上面是一架冷結機，機的一端有一根管子接通在蒸奶鍋上，另一端却接在裝瓶機漏戽里，壁上就是奶瓶消毒的蒸汽箱門，後面有一聞冷氣室，羊奶裝好了瓶，便去藏在冷氣室中。</p>
<p>在這些地方參觀過了，於是我們便去參觀羊柵；羊柵計有兩埭屋子，每屋裏有鐵欄兩列及食槽兩埭，每頭羊子均係隔離居住，不能爭奪食料和侵略地位。而屋子里每天必須沖洗一次，所以非常清潔；並且每天總要在外面園里放牧一次。</p>
<p>該塲開辦的資本是十萬元，現畜羊子有二百多頭。此種羊子都是瑞典種，每頭價值約八十元左右，平均一頭羊子一天可擠兩次奶，至少有八磅。如不發生意外，一頭羊子可產三年乳，三年以外，便本能擠奶了。這些羊子的乳袋很大，樣子倒有點像是牛的乳袋。</p>
<p>牠們的飼料是和綿羊差不多的，總不外荳麥，豆餅，青草等，但牠們除了產乳之外，毛肉稀不足用。</p>
<p>至於羊奶和牛奶的分別，只是羊奶少一點T.B，其他蛋白質和維他命都是一樣的，並且羊奶較牛奶為優，因為牛乳性熟，而且不適合於病弱及有胃病的人飲服，羊乳則頗有利於胃病患者，况它是不分季節寒暖的。</p>
<p>價格方面，和牛奶也沒有多大出入</p>
<p>不過，飼畜這種羊子須要管理得好，譬如房舍的清潔，空氣的流通，疾病的預防等，均需要嚴密的設備，不然，難免時常有死喪傳染的危險！</p>
<p>他開辦到如今還不過一年多，然而據說成績到很好，奶的銷路也不差，但這銷路都是在上海一地，别處却很少。</p>
<p>最後我又在該塲的各部份巡禮了一番；那裏。除了羊柵及装瓶的各部之外，還有一個辦事處，一個傳達處，一個自流井馬達間及貯水亭，一個水汀間，前面草地上更有一座茅亭。而且這里完全是鄉村風味，不但環境幽靜，空氣新鮮，風景更其是美麗，而交通又是非常便利的，所以我覺得這地位實在是太好了。</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) After Arriving in Hong Kong on the 13th, Deng Longguang Sent a Letter to Chen Jitang on the 15th, Offering his Final Loyal Advice; The Original Letter is as Follows: Respectfully Addressed to Chief Commander Bonan, Since Serving Under Your Command, Five Years have Passed in an Instant; First, I was Ordered to Command Ships, then I Led Divisions; Recently, I was Honored with Your Deep Trust and Transferred to be Deputy Military Commander; I am Grateful and Indebted Beyond Words; Now I Suddenly Leave Without Saying Goodbye, My Heart is Filled with Pain; However, I Cannot Help but Explain the Reasons and I Dare Not Agree with Things that Should Not Be Done; I Respectfully Offer Advice that is Heartfelt and Bleeding from the Depths of My Heart on the Matters of Great Righteousness and Benefit; I Believe that Your Excellency, with Your Authority Over Guangdong and Supporting the Southern Sky, Every Move Concerns the Safety and Security of the Country, Every Decision Determines the Rise and Fall of the Nation, You Must First Win the Hearts of the People Before You Can Gain the Support of the People; In Recent Years, Longguang Led his Troops North to Shaoshu, East to Chao Hui, and Then to Anxun in Jiangxi; Whether Dismounting to Camp or Hurrying with Hidden Muzzles, I Only Knew to Supervise My Troops to Eliminate Bandits and Suppress Communists, Remove Violence and Pacify the People, Never Disturbing the People for a Single Thread or Grain to Enrich Myself, Nor Taking a Single Tax or Donation to Fill My Own Pockets; I Am Willing to be a Beast of Burden for the Group and Vow to be Clean and Honest Forever for Myself; Everything that Can Remove Pain for the People, Rectify the Atmosphere for the Place, Extend the Life of the Group, and Win People's Hearts for Your Excellency, I have Exhausted My Foolish Sincerity and Strived to do My Best; My Conscience is Clear, I have No Shame in My Bedchamber; The Way I Repay Your Excellency is in My Heart and Not in Private Gain, The Way I Love Your Excellency is in Righteousness and Not in Flattery; I Did Not Expect that Public Interest Would Hinder Private Gain, and Righteousness Would Not Tolerate Flattery; Those Who Must Remove Me to be Happy are Many, Those Who Entrap Your Excellency in Injustice are Also of This Kind; Once Military Power is Removed, Arrests Follow, The Rumors of Detention Became Reality in an Instant; Even if I Wanted to Save You, it Would be Impossible; To Avoid Current Losses and Seek a Way to Preserve Yourself, This is Why Longguang Left Without Saying Goodbye; Moreover, Once Trust is Not Established, Doubts Arise, and Worries Deepen; Perhaps My Departure Can Slightly Alleviate Your Concerns; As for the Southwest's Advocacy of Resistance Against Japan, if the Name Matches the Reality, the World Will Surely Follow; Longguang Will Rush to Righteousness, How Dare I Lag Behind; However, Resistance Against Japan is a Matter of Life and Death for the Nation, and the Rise and Fall of the Country Depends on it, Therefore, True Names Cannot be Used for Personal Gain; If it Violates the Facts, How Can it be Believed by the Public; Moreover, Unity Strengthens National Power, and Sincerity Resolves Grievances; Although Your Excellency has No Intention of Using the Enemy to Enhance Your Own Importance, the Petty People Harbour the Idea of Holding Your Excellency Hostage for Their Own Convenience; Thus, They Disregard Public Opinion and Insist on Their Own Way, Burying the People of Guangdong in Water and Fire Without Regret, and Trapping the Country in Decline Without Resentment; Anyone with a Little Conscience, Who Would Agree; Therefore, General Wu Raised the Banner of Righteousness, Brother Hao Resigned from His Post, and Brothers Li, Huang, and Zhang Also Followed One After Another; It is Not Treason Against Your Excellency, But it Comes from the True Sincerity of Loving and Protecting Your Excellency, Hoping to Promote Your Excellency's Awareness; Longguang's Conscience has Not Been Extinguished, and Great Righteousness is Still Clear, How Dare I Not Follow; Now General Wu has Been Appointed by the Central Government to Reorganize the Guangdong Situation; Those Below the Military Advisor Who Have Accepted New Appointments are All People Whom Your Excellency Promoted and Trusted; The Troops are the Same as Before, and the Group Remains as Before; It Can be Seen that the Central Government's Intention is Only to Unify the Political Orders, Not to Make Things Difficult for People; This Painstaking Effort is Seen by All; I Beg Your Excellency to Understand the Hearts of the People Who are Weary of War, and to Understand the Courage of Your Comrades Who See Righteousness and Understand Reason; With a Peaceful Thought, Turn Around and Plan; Save the Error of One Wrong Move, and Return to the Joy of Rebirth from a Bad Situation; If You Can Humbly Come to Assist the Central Government, Then Your Excellency's Days of Saving the Country and the People Will be Long, and Your Desire to Resist the Enemy and Defend Against Insults Will Surely be Achieved; Ning's Special Reputation Will be Permanently Preserved, and the Country's Gratitude Will be Abundant; Otherwise, Who Will be the Chief of the Military, Painfully Wielding the Swords of Brothers, What is the Guilt of the People Driven to Fight Among Themselves, Wounding National Strength and Benefiting the Enemy; Whether it is a Crime or a Merit, There is No Need to Wait for Future Generations to Judge; Your Excellency is Intelligent, How Can You Bear to Do This; Longguang is Leaving, Baring My Heart and Gouging Out My Eyes, I Dare to Offer My Last Loyal Words; As I Put Pen to Paper, I Cannot Help but Let My Tears Flow; I Beg You to Consider it, Incomplete and Unceremonious, I Respectfully Wish You Prosperity, Your Subordinate Deng Longguang Respectfully, Printed (15th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e17">Observations on the Future of the Suzhou-Jiaxing Railway <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>The Suzhou-Jiaxing Railway, from Suzhou to Jiaxing, a total of 75 kilometers, began operations yesterday. Another line has been added to the Southeast railway network. The railway transportation between Beijing and Hangzhou can reduce more than two hours of time. At a time when the country's finances are extremely difficult and the need for transportation links is extremely urgent, the completion of this 75-kilometer railway is of great significance in national defense and its economic value cannot be ignored. It is truly a matter of great rejoicing in recent times.</p>
<p>The railway connection between Suzhou and Jiaxing was proposed very early. During the Guangxu period, Zhang Jian and German engineers conducted a detailed survey of the line and found three major shortcomings: too many river mouths, hindering the water conservancy of Taihu Lake; it runs parallel to the Grand Canal, making it difficult for commercial transport to develop; and the terrain is too low, causing too much farmland to be abandoned. Therefore, it was abandoned. The Suzhou-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway was changed to the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway. It was not until 1933, after the lessons of the Shanghai War, that the government decided to rebuild the Suzhou-Jiaxing Railway. The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Bureaus were in charge of the matter. In the spring of 1934, reconnaissance began, and construction began in the spring of last year. In April of this year, the entire line of rails and sleepers was laid. Last month, the station buildings and everything else was completed.</p>
<p>Commentators say that the economic significance of the Suzhou-Jiaxing Railway is not as important as its national defense significance. This statement is not entirely true. Although the water and road transportation along the Suzhou-Jiaxing line are already very convenient, the population is dense and the resources are rich, so further development can still be expected. Within the scope of the road itself, according to the current road transport situation, passengers traveling between Suzhou and Wujiang, and between Wujiang Shengze and Jiaxing, are extremely crowded. After the opening of the Suzhou-Jiaxing Railway, at least one-third of the passengers will be absorbed by the railway. In terms of freight transport, railway freight rates are not as low as those of boats, so it is not easy to compete with water transport. However, it is also possible to absorb freight transport by selectively offering special prices for large-volume transport.</p>
<p>Moreover, the greatest economic value of the road lies in intermodal transport. Suzhou and Jiaxing are transportation hubs in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and the Suzhou-Jiaxing road is becoming a shortcut for Beijing-Hangzhou connections. Before the completion of the road, passengers from Hangzhou Zhakou to Nanjing had to detour to Shanghai North Station, which took 10 hours and 45 minutes by train. From now on, they can travel from Zhakou to Jiaxing, via the Suzhou-Jiaxing Railway to Nanjing, in about 8 hours and 30 minutes. They can arrive, which is more than 2 hours shorter than detouring to Shanghai. The line from Beijing to Shanghai and Hangzhou is 500 kilometers long, while the line from Beijing, Suzhou, Jiaxing, and Hangzhou is only 390 kilometers. The difference between them is about 100 kilometers. From now on, passenger traffic between Beijing and Zhakou will inevitably be transported via the Suzhou-Jiaxing road, and the prosperity of passenger and freight intermodal transport can be expected.</p>
<p>Due to the encirclement of waterways, freight transport in the short distance along the line may not be easy to develop. However, if the management authorities can selectively connect the main waterways with each other, railway revenue can also be increased. Moreover, Pingwang on the road is the midpoint of the shipping route between Suzhou and Huzhou. If this is used as a water-land freight intermodal transport station to absorb the goods in the Huzhou area, it is also possible for goods to abandon waterways and take land routes. In short, from an economic point of view, the future of the Suzhou-Jiaxing Railway is not as pessimistic as some commentators have said. How to make good use of it to enable this newly completed railway to achieve economic self-sufficiency depends on the efforts of the management authorities.</p>

<p>(London) During today's House of Commons session, Conservative MP Sir Milne asked about the results of the British government's consultations with the US government regarding the North China smuggling issue, and whether the UK and US would take joint action to address it.

He believed that further government action at present would be unhelpful. Sir Milne then stated that several weeks had passed since the British government lodged a protest. Labour MP Fletcher inquired whether British interests had been greatly harmed by smuggling and whether the British government would issue orders to the British fleet stationed in China. The Foreign Secretary replied that the various steps had been taken because British interests had been harmed. (Reuters, 15th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) After the League of Nations Special Assembly's discussion on amending the League of Nations Covenant, it was decided that at the General Assembly on September 5, countries could submit their opinions on amending the Covenant to the General Assembly Secretariat before September 1. It is reported that past amendments to the League of Nations Covenant by the Chinese government have only involved the organization of the Council and the allocation of membership fees, as well as issues such as the International Court of Justice, and have never touched on important articles of the League of Nations' functions. However, the spirit of the League of Nations is based on coordination. Since the Sino-Japanese issue, the League of Nations' functions have generally been deemed too lenient, and with the occurrence of the Italo-Ethiopian issue, the League of Nations' functions have become even more difficult. Therefore, all member states are unanimously paying attention to Article 16 of the Covenant, hoping to confirm its capabilities. The opinions of various countries on amending the Covenant can be divided into two factions. Faction A believes that the League of Nations failed due to the imperfection of its structure, with British Foreign Secretary Eden and French Prime Minister Léon Blum being active representatives of this faction. Faction B believes that the failure is not due to the imperfection of the structure or insufficient strength, but rather the lack of sincerity and determination of member states regarding resolutions, such as evading sanctions, and that it would be better to delete Article 16 and Article 11, and at the same time, allow countries that have withdrawn from the League of Nations to return. The British Conservative Party belongs to this faction. It is confirmed that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is earnestly studying the issue of amending the Covenant at the League of Nations General Assembly on September 10, and will submit its own amendment opinions. This plan has not yet been concretely decided, but the principle has been determined, that is, from China's standpoint, amending the Covenant must be based on the principle of enhancing the League of Nations' strength, which can be said to be largely in sympathy with Eden's proposal. The detailed opinions are still being drafted and will be telegraphed to the attending representatives Gu Weijun and Guo Taiqi next month for their information. (Special Dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Over 100 organized pirates have been discovered in the waters of Laoting, led by a man surnamed Wang. They possess five armored shallow-draft sailing ships, equipped with heavy firearms such as steel cannons and machine guns. Last week, they abducted a lieutenant commander, the chief engineer of a certain foreign warship, at the mouth of the Luan River, and shot him dead for ransom. Subsequently, they abducted two more officers. A certain country dispatched two destroyers from Lushun to search and suppress them. The bandits fled into the reeds at the mouth of the Luan River. Due to the urgent pursuit, they have released the two officers. Some of the pirates landed and fled to Haozizhuang in Laoting. The county magistrate and the chief of the Public Security Bureau were dismissed for their ineffective suppression efforts. The mouth of the Luan River is still under blockade by a certain foreign warship. (Special Dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The previous regulations of the Central Government regarding the official correspondence format for people's organizations were quite divergent, easily causing misunderstandings. To seek uniformity, the Central Government has re-promulgated a letter requesting the National Government to instruct the Executive Yuan to notify all relevant parties to comply. The Executive Yuan issued an order on the 16th to comply. The revised methods are as follows: (1) People's organizations with systematic organization, that is, those with subordinate relationships, use "Orders" for upper-level correspondence to lower-level organizations, and lower-level organizations use "Reports" to upper-level organizations, but associations and individual members may use "Letters" to each other, as stated in Section 2, Item 4 of the Revised People's Organization Regulations. The so-called "systematic organization" refers to those with subordinate relationships, such as farmers' associations below the provincial and municipal level, labor unions below the county and city level (including those directly under the Executive Yuan), women's associations below the provincial level, and educational associations below the provincial and municipal level, etc. (2) People's organizations with grades but no subordinate relationships use "Letters" uniformly, as explained in Section 2, Item 4 of the Revised People's Organization Regulations. The so-called "organizations with grades" refers to those that have provincial and county-level grades but no subordinate relationships, such as fishermen's associations, chambers of commerce, and other specifically designated special social organizations, etc. After this regulation, all previous circulars from the Ministry of Public Instruction of the Central Executive Committee on July 3 of the 20th year of the Republic and the notices from the Guidance Committee for People's Movement of the Central Executive Committee on June 1 of the 20th year of the Republic shall be abolished.

Two printing presses and printing materials such as inks, paper, and dyes used for counterfeiting banknotes were found in a servant's bedroom. The suspects confessed that most of the counterfeit banknotes had circulated in Zhangjiakou, Tongzhou, Baoding, and other important cities and towns. Before searching the residence, detectives went to two locations on Hatamen Street and arrested six people who confessed to using the counterfeit banknotes in the market in recent weeks.

<p>(Berlin) With the establishment of the German-Austrian agreement, the mission of Minister Papen to Austria has ended. (Papen was ordered to Austria in late July 1934 after the assassination of former Austrian Prime Minister Dollfuss, with the mission of restoring normal relations between the two countries). It is heard that he will be transferred as ambassador to Britain, filling the vacancy left by former Ambassador Hoesch. The ambassadorial duties are currently performed by Chargé d'affaires Prince Bismarck. (Havas, 14th)</p>

<p>(Rome) The German military delegation has been here for several days and has now departed for their country. It is rumored that the purpose of the group’s visit was to hold talks with Italian General Staff officers and to establish an agreement. Responsible persons here have stated that this trip was a courtesy visit, and took the opportunity to observe military exercises, and has no political significance. (Havas, 14th)</p>

<p>(Moscow) The famous Soviet writer Radic commented on the German-Austrian agreement in today's Izvestia, saying:</p>
<p>"Although Italian Fascism has become weaker in Europe after its victory in Abyssinia, Italy's softening is perhaps due to its victory in Abyssinia. Mussolini is eager to form a united front with Germany diplomatically, so he does not hesitate to support the Austrian-German agreement. If Germany wants to obtain British neutrality when it goes to war with France and Russia, it will not combine with Italy. After achieving its goals, both sides will definitely prepare to deceive each other. Germany's signing of the agreement with Austria this time, in addition to showing its alliance with Italy, aims to expand Germany's influence in Austria, and at the same time advance from Austria to the Balkan countries. As for the German newspapers claiming that the German-Austrian agreement is enough to show Hitler's love of peace, it is ridiculous. Regardless of whether Germany participates in the Prussian conference, its actions are tantamount to telling the organizers of the conference, whether you agree with me or not, I will move forward. Now I am going to annex Austria, why don't you quickly recognize the remilitarization of the Rhineland?" This is Germany's clear message to Britain and France, and hopes that Britain and France can understand its intentions. (TASS dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<h3 id="e50">The Locarno Conference Will Convene as Scheduled, but Britain May Find It Difficult to Support; Italy Conditions Participation on Inviting Germany; Calls for Establishing a New Treaty from Scratch <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) Official sources recently stated that the British government may find it difficult to support the Locarno Conference convening as scheduled. Although Germany has not submitted a reply to the British questionnaire, the agreement recently reached between Germany and Austria has indirectly answered the sixth item of the questionnaire. (Note: The sixth item of the British questionnaire states that Germany is prepared to negotiate non-aggression pacts with its neighboring countries in the southeast and northeast. The British government has taken note of this and expressed satisfaction, but the British government also wants to know whether this pact can be supplemented with mutual assistance agreements.) If Britain, France, and Belgium hold a meeting at this time, it will only arouse resentment from Germany and Italy. (Havas dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Regarding the Locarno Conference, the Italian government has stated that it will refuse to participate, saying that Germany is one of the signatories to the Locarno Treaty, and if it does not participate, it will only exacerbate the dispute. Political figures recently declared that if Britain, France, Belgium, Germany, and Italy can hold a meeting on an equal footing, the meeting can still be convened in Belgium. However, the Locarno Treaty is now in ruins, and the countries concerned must start from scratch and establish a new treaty. (Havas dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Eden returned to Beijing today after his vacation and immediately studied the issue of postponing the Locarno Conference. Well-informed sources believe that what the British government advocates is to postpone the meeting for several weeks so that the situation can improve and a more perfect solution can be obtained. At that time, it may be possible for Italy and Germany to participate together and become a five-nation conference. (The Italian side has already expressed this intention.) France and Belgium still insist on convening the meeting as scheduled (i.e., on the 22nd of this month), and Britain, France, and Belgium will issue a declaration immediately after the adjournment of the meeting, and in the future, if they want to convene a five-nation conference, they can reserve room for maneuver. (Havas dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(London) Today's news: Britain's request to invite Germany to participate in the conference of signatories to the Locarno Treaty was not agreed to by France, causing the meeting to be postponed until mid-August. British Foreign Secretary Eden may first have informal talks with Belgian Prime Minister Zeeland and French Foreign Minister Delbos. It is reported that Britain originally intended to invite Germany after the opening of the conference, but because Italy insisted that if Germany was not invited, Italy would not participate either, it changed its scheduled plan. French Prime Minister Blum believes that if Germany is invited, it will make Head of State Hitler more headstrong and will tacitly approve of its remilitarization in the Rhineland. At the same time, it is reported that Britain is now willing to abolish the mutual assistance pact signed with Mediterranean countries. (National Telegram on the 14th)</p>

<p>(London) Regarding the internal situation in Abyssinia, the diplomatic correspondent of the Manchester Guardian recently declared that the Italian army is now facing major difficulties. Since the former Governor-General Batuglio returned home, all the work that should have been completed within a few months has not achieved considerable results. For example, most of the roads are in poor condition and inconvenient for traffic. The only route it relies on is the railway line from the French Djibouti port to the Abyssinian capital, but it is also constantly threatened by the Abyssinian people, and the incident of the tracks being dismantled has been seen many times. These natives are erratic. Once the Italian army comes to attack, they will retreat to protect themselves. Although they do not make organized resistance, their strength should not be underestimated. Even between the various factions, they can sometimes contact each other. As for the western Gole area, it is the location of the new Abyssinian government, and the resistance movement also originates from here. After the new victory of the Italian army, they are all arrogant, but they know that the so-called "pacification" work is fraught with thorns, far beyond what they initially expected.

<p>Warsaw After Danzig City Senate Chairman Greiser made a passionate speech at the League of Nations Administrative Council, expressing dissatisfaction with the current situation in the city, the Administrative Council immediately entrusted the Polish authorities to formulate a solution. Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck also personally went to the city at the end of last week to conduct an investigation. Well-informed sources recently declared that the Polish government has put forward several requests to resolve the Danzig issue, and the situation is still smooth. The so-called requests are (1) the right to manage the port of Danzig should be maintained by the Polish government; (2) Polish police may be stationed in Danzig City; (3) After the chairman of the Danzig City Senate is elected, the Polish government may deny it; (4) The bank issuing in Danzig City may be managed by the Polish government. Regarding this issue, Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck stated that when he returned to the country from Geneva the other day, he passed through Berlin and had discussions with German Aviation Minister General Goering, who both expressed their willingness to compromise. Until recently, the Polish High Commissioner in the city, Baber, also declared that if the current system in Danzig City is modified by unilateral action, the Polish government will naturally come out to oppose it, but if the Polish government can obtain practical and reliable exchange conditions, then it will be another matter. As for the requirements recently put forward by Poland, although some people in Danzig political circles regard them as somewhat excessive, the solution can be found quickly. It is expected that Danzig City Senate Chairman Greiser will be forced to resign within a short period of time, but this will be exchanged for the "long-term vacation" of the League of Nations High Commissioner Lester. At present, police are densely deployed in front of the League of Nations High Commissioner's Office, and the city government has taken no notice of Lester's repeated protests against the crackdown measures ordered by the Danzig City government against opposition newspapers. The tense situation can be seen from this. (Havas dispatch on the 14th)</p>

<p>(London) Lloyd's of London released a report on the British shipbuilding industry for the quarter ending June 30, stating that British and Northern Irish shipyards are currently building a total of 848,732 tons of ships, an increase of 50% compared to the same quarter last year. Since 1930, the tonnage of ships built in a quarter has been the highest this quarter. This figure is equal to 43.5% of the tonnage currently being built worldwide, except for Russia, because the figures for that country could not be ascertained. The White Star Line is now considering building at least eight new ships, not including a sister ship to the Mary Queen. The government's rearmament plan will give each naval shipyard six months of work in the future, from 33,000-ton battleships to submarines, so the activity of British shipyards will be at its peak for a while, and factories for engines, boilers, and cannons will also be very busy. Factories that have been closed for many years will now be fully staffed. According to naval experts quoted by the Daily Telegraph, the Sheffield factory alone will build twenty-four 14-inch guns, one hundred and ten 6-inch guns, and two hundred 4.75-inch guns. The renovation process is expected to last at least until 1942. (Reuters dispatch on the 15th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Due to the many incidents in the European political situation, the relationship between Germany, Austria, Italy, and Britain and France, and the issue of League of Nations reorganization are gradually becoming more serious.

<p>(Paris) After the People's Front held a large-scale parade this afternoon, Prime Minister Blum made a lengthy speech at the Place de la Nation, briefly stating, "Last year today, we gathered here and jointly swore an oath. This oath has been fulfilled. It was so in the past, and it will be so in the future. What we swore to do is, first and foremost, to obey public opinion and unite with each other. We have now fully united and have achieved results because of unity. This can be seen from the social and labor bills we have put forward. After two weeks of discussion by the Senate and the House of Representatives, they were all passed. This bill, whether in spirit or substance, is not just a reform, but a New Deal." Prime Minister Blum also said, "There are still several important policies that we should implement in the future, namely (1) implementing a large-scale public works plan, (2) organizing a credit system for small and medium-sized businesses and small and medium-sized industries to provide working capital, (3) controlling prices, especially retail food prices, (4) young people seeking a way out should be arranged by administrative agencies. In short, it is necessary for our country to continue to progress under the current circumstances, because continuing progress is a condition for establishing true order. Otherwise, stagnation or even retrogression will inevitably lead to disturbances, or at least cause disturbances. Although the people of the whole country are behind us, they should also feel the harm of haste and rashness, because the social components included in the People's Front are very complex, including workers, farmers, businessmen, small landowners, and small savers. If we do not concentrate our will and align our steps, how can we achieve anything? Like this, the demands put forward by the working class, anything that may cause unrest and disturbance in the country, we should loudly call out and制止 it. In short, the working class is fighting for social justice, and the republicans are fighting for civil and political freedom. There must be sincere unity between the two to be effective. Our country's history is sufficient proof. I would like to encourage you all." (Havas dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today is National Day, and the various parties belonging to the People's Front held a large-scale parade in the afternoon to celebrate. There were one million participants, and there were also crowds of people standing on the roadside to watch. When the parade passed through the workers' area, the residents watched from the windows, and cheers resounded. Especially in the Saint-Antoine village in the suburbs, the scene was even more enthusiastic, because the village was the origin of the Second Revolution in 1848. The marchers heard the cheers from the roadside and responded with cheers, and shouted the slogans of the People's Front. As for its ranks, they were led by members of the People's Front, members of parliament, and cabinet members, such as Fure, the Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, a cabinet member without portfolio. Then, because of the large number of participants, they were divided into two teams, each team including several groups, all holding huge red flags as guides to mark the names of each group, such as the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, the Radical Socialist Party, various trade unions, etc. When they reached the Place de la Bastille, the two teams merged into one, then split again and marched until the Place de la Nation, where they reunited in one place. The leaders then made speeches in public. At that time, the crowd had already gathered in the square, and some climbed nearby trees or power poles, and some sat high on the roof or looked out the window. The large team came slowly, and the streets were already packed, so they had to walk slowly. At that time, a large number of police were concentrated in nearby streets, but they did not come out to interfere, and the marchers did not see where the police were deployed. All cabinet members and important figures of the People's Front stood on the stone altar in the square. The chairman of the Human Rights Federation, Bashu, first made a speech, followed by Minister of State and Minister of National Defense Daladier, Socialist Party Assistant Secretary-General Seforak, Independent Socialist Party leader Montagnon, Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives and Communist Party member Dugros, and General Secretary of the United General Confederation of Labor Ishikawa. The last speaker was Prime Minister Leon Blum (see separate telegram for the words). The main points of the speeches of the leaders were to demand that the various parties and groups belonging to the People's Front unite, and that all workers and middle classes should form a common front. Although some of the programs stipulated by the People's Front have been implemented, it will not be possible to implement all of them without national unity and 整饬 discipline. When Prime Minister Blum spoke, it was 5:45 p.m. After the speech, the crowd cheered and sang the Internationale in response. (Havas dispatch on the 14th)</p>

<p>— Our reporter Hu Zhongchi, Hu Yizang</p>
<p>As we entered Nagasaki Port, the sights on the shore caught our eye. The most striking was the Nagasaki Shipyard, which leaned against the mountain. Long shipbuilding platforms made of interlaced steel bones stretched out into the sea, with several hulls under construction alongside. Our ship passed by there and docked at the pier. We were going to Kobe, and since the ship had a four-hour stop in Nagasaki, we went ashore. We took a rickshaw to our consulate. As we rounded a corner, we saw the blue sky and white sun flag of the consulate waving in the distance. The consulate was near the Shusshi Bridge, a two-story Western-style building with a small yard in front planted with a few trees and plants. An elderly Japanese maid in the guardhouse at the door handed our business cards in, and we met Consul Liu Ruxiang and Secretary Guo Jianying in the reception room. Consul Liu was from Guangdong and had been working in Nagasaki for many years. We could see his forthright personality from the expression in his conversation. He had a harmonious relationship with the local administrative officials in Nagasaki. The local government originally wanted to implement a law to increase taxes on Chinese traders, but it was temporarily shelved because of his efforts. We talked about the Japanese news industry. According to him, the major Japanese newspapers could only speak for the military and the government and could not be considered representatives of public opinion. The Fukuoka Nichinichi Shimbun in Kyushu was comparatively more outspoken and often had sharp criticisms of the military and government policies. He also said that Japanese newspapers often contained many inaccuracies about the internal affairs of China. When he met Japanese journalists who came to visit, he often criticized them to their faces for their lack of understanding of China. Consul Guo was proficient in painting and had often contributed to our newspaper a few years ago. At that time, he asked about the recent situation of friends in Shanghai. We talked with Mr. Liu and Mr. Guo for a long time, and when other guests came in, we said goodbye and agreed to visit again when we returned from our trip.</p>
<p>We left the consulate and strolled around the street for a while before returning to the ship. The scenery was excellent as the ship headed towards Kobe. The islands of various sizes that came into view were all lush green. We passed by those islands the next morning as we passed through the Seto Inland Sea. Most of this sea area is forest, and occasionally, we could see well-organized agricultural fields.</p>
<p>At 2:00 PM, the "Nagasaki Maru" docked in Kobe, almost twenty-four hours after departing from Nagasaki. We handed our luggage over to the Japan Travel Bureau, and we ourselves carried our hand luggage ashore and walked a long way before reaching customs. The customs officers turned every one of our large and small boxes inside out and asked about the value of some of the items inside before writing the letters "OK" on the outside of the boxes in pink chalk. The strict customs barrier was finally passed. Only then did we feel relieved.</p>
<p>Two Entering the Gateway to Western Japan</p>
<p>Leaving the customs, we saw the green peaks of the Rokko Mountains in the distance. We especially noticed the two circular marks formed by the green forest on Mount Suwa, one was the city emblem of Kobe. The other was an anchor pattern, presumably symbolizing this great world harbor with international ships coming and going. We took a "Taxi" (cars waiting for hire on the street) in front of the customs to a pre-arranged inn. The minimum rental fee for a "Taxi" was 50 sen, and the fee increased according to mileage after the trip exceeded a certain distance. We passed through several wide and well-organized city streets, glimpsed many magnificent buildings, and felt that the city of Kobe, known as the gateway to western Japan, was very comparable to our Shanghai in terms of construction.</p>
<p>The inn where we stayed was not far from Sannomiya Station and was a purely Japanese-style building. Although the facade was not large, the internal facilities were very complete, and the layout was very refined. We stayed in a room upstairs by the window. The interior decoration was full of artistic interest. The patterns of the window frames and the styles of the paper doors were different on each side, but they were very harmonious. The room was filled with a simple mood. Neither the floor nor the wooden pillars were painted. On the wall hung a "Celestial Maiden Painting" with Nandina and daffodils. Below it was an elegant potted plant. Opposite the window was a plaque with the inscription "The Taste of Tea and the Taste of Zen." The calligraphy was very refined, and it was signed "Jizaian." All of this arrangement made us deeply feel the Japanese people's universal artistic taste and charm.</p>

<h3 id="e80">The Sale of the Tianjin Huaxin Yarn Factory: Difficult to Operate Due to Pressure from Japanese Yarn Factories; All Six Beiyang Yarn Factories are Nearing the End <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The Tianjin Huaxin Spinning Factory held a shareholders' meeting on the 13th. The opinions of the shareholders included the following: (1) The machinery is old, consumes a lot, and produces little. There is a lack of large funds for renovation; (2) The current situation in North China is unstable, and the Japanese textile industry is advancing into Tianjin, using its large capitalist system to control the North China economy. The shareholders have no courage to invest huge sums again to increase capital; (3) Banks are reluctant to lend money due to the unstable situation; (4) Foreign debts have been repeatedly extended, but the creditors are pressing too hard and must be paid off immediately. Based on the above four reasons, everyone agreed that it would be better to sell out rather than continue operating. If there are those willing to take over and are willing to pay a reasonable price, then the share capital can still recover 20% to 30%. After deliberation, it was decided to appoint directors Liu Junqing and Xu Jishang as responsible persons to contact outside parties for the sale. Before the sale, no matter how difficult, they will still try to maintain operations to avoid the severance of livelihood for the majority of workers. The original text of the shareholders' proposal for the sale at this meeting is recorded as follows: "Respectfully, our factory has been operating poorly for years, and shareholders have no profits to share. Although this is due to the economic downturn, human efforts have also not been perfect. We have heard that there was a slight surplus last year, but no actual profit. If this continues, the shareholders will be asking for the moon. Recently, the situation in North China has become increasingly urgent, with endless changes. In terms of politics and economy, ×× is using every means of pressure. Several of Tianjin's large yarn factories have already changed hands. Our factory, at this time of great change, does not know what good strategies can be expected to overcome this difficult situation. If we continue to procrastinate and do not revitalize ourselves, I am afraid that we will also go bankrupt in a few years and become the achievements of other factories. It is better to plan early, either to close the factory or to sell it out, so that the shareholders' capital will not be completely lost and there will be no hope. We request that your committee quickly determine the major policy direction and make plans to prevent future troubles. (The following is omitted)."</p>
<p>The Huaxin Yarn Factory is the smallest of the six major Beiyang yarn factories, with 27,000 spindles, 15,000 in the Tianjin factory and 12,000 in the Tangshan branch. Its operations are well-managed and its management is quite innovative, so in recent years, although the North China industrial sector has been shaken by crises, this factory alone has been able to stand firm. However, since this year, smuggling has been rampant, and the sales of smuggled yarn have become more widespread. In the past, every bale of yarn sold incurred a loss of about 10 yuan, but now it has increased to more than 20 yuan. The sales routes in southern Hebei and western Shandong have all been taken away. Although Huaxin is well-managed, it still loses two to three thousand yuan a day. Recently, the Japanese Toyo Textile Company is building the Yufeng Yarn Factory Tianjin factory (the main factory is in Shanghai) in Tianjin's Special District Four. Construction has begun and will be completed in April next year and the factory will open in October. The first phase is 50,000 spindles and 1,000 looms, and the second and third phases are planned to have 100,000 spindles. The Yuyuan Yarn Factory was sold to the Japanese Zhong Spinning Company and renamed Public Great Sixth Factory, with 75,000 spindles. Although the machinery is old, it will be renovated. The Yuda Yarn Factory, managed by Japanese merchants, originally had 30,000 spindles and is also planning to expand and purchase new machinery. Huaxin, looking around at its situation, has no ability to compete and fears that after the yarn factory is completed in one year, there will be no need to resist and Huaxin will have to close down. At that time, even if it wants to sell out, it will not be possible, so it is better to plan early, hence the previous resolution. It is rumored that the buyer has been determined to be the Greater Japan Textile Company. If the deal is completed, then three of the six Beiyang factories will fall into Japanese hands, one factory will be closed (Baocheng), and He Hengyuan and Beiyang will be managed by a trust company organized by the banking community, almost like the light of a dying ember.

<h3 id="e81">Hebei Province Handles General Village Clearance: Joint Defense and Suppression of Bandits on the Border between Hebei-Shandong and Hebei-Henan; Implementing the Baojia System and Conducting Household Registration <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Baoding Correspondence: In order to eliminate bandit troubles in the province and consolidate local security, the Hebei Provincial Government previously divided the entire province into ten security zones, each with a bandit suppression commander responsible for bandit suppression and drug prohibition matters within its jurisdiction. It was also permitted to divide the stationed troops into four regions: southern Hebei, western Hebei, central Hebei, and northern Hebei, to jointly suppress the remaining bandits in each region. Therefore, the major bandit disasters in various parts of the province have been successively eliminated. As for sporadic small gangs, they have also largely gradually disappeared. However, the southern Hebei area is adjacent to northern Henan and western Shandong, and the mountains in the Wuan and Shexian areas of northern Henan are connected, making it a bandit's nest. In addition, the bandits take advantage of the limited defense zones of the stationed troops on the provincial border to travel back and forth, causing harm for years. Governor Song Zheyuan of Hebei Province is now determined to eliminate these roaming bandits and has specially implemented joint defense with the Henan and Shandong authorities. Regarding the joint defense issue in the Hebei-Henan border area, the Hebei border is jointly undertaken by the Chen Huafu Brigade of the stationed troops, and the Henan border is undertaken by the Huang Guanghua Division of the stationed troops. When necessary, both sides can also cross the border to pursue and attack. Therefore, the border areas of the two provinces are currently very peaceful. The joint defense measures between Hebei and Shandong are handled by Song Zheyuan and Shandong Governor Han Fuju in person. The defense zone is near the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, including Dezhou in Shandong and Qinghe, Wuqiao, Qingyun, and Gucheng in Hebei. In the past, large gangs of roaming bandits often occurred, but now there have been no major bandit disasters. From now on, the source of bandits in Hebei Province will be cut off, and local security can be guaranteed.</p>
<p>In order to eliminate bad elements in various counties, the Hebei Provincial Government decided to start by strengthening the basic organization of the people, so it organized the baojia system and conducted household registration. The provincial government stipulated detailed measures and ordered all counties to implement them. The organizational steps are to establish one jia for every ten households, with a jiazhang (jia leader), one bao for every ten jia, with a baozhang (bao leader), and one zongbao (chief bao) for each township, with a zongbaozhang (chief bao leader). The method of jia organization is to start from one side of each village or town and conduct household registration door-to-door. If there are not enough households for one jia, a jia can be established for six or more households, and five or fewer households can be merged into the neighboring jia. This work has already begun and is scheduled to be completed by the end of August. All able-bodied men aged 18 to 45 in various places must be listed in a separate register. The first step is to train the bao leaders and jia leaders, and then the bao leaders and jia leaders will train the able-bodied men, so that the local able-bodied men can have the power to defend the local area themselves. Currently, blockhouses have been built in various counties, and the baojia organization will also be completed. There will be no place for bad elements to stand. (July 11)</p>
<h3 id="e82">The Water Level of the Lower Yellow River Rises Sharply: Lisheng Village Has Risen a Total of Five Meters in Four Days; The Yellow River Estuary Project Will be Completed Quickly <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Since the major flood last year, the people of Jiangsu and Shandong provinces have suffered deeply. Whenever they hear of the Yellow River rising, they rush to tell each other, showing a great fear of tigers. Now, it is not yet the flood season, but flood warnings have been repeatedly issued, and the increase in river water in recent days has been unprecedented. According to calculations by the River Affairs Bureau, the upstream Lisheng Village in Shandong Province rose more than four meters from the 10th to the evening of the 12th, and another nine inches and seven points from the morning of the 12th to the morning of the 13th, for a total increase of about five meters in four days. The main current is surging unusually. The upstream of Shandong Province has many dangerous works. The various cofferdams are severely impacted by the water. The Director of the River Affairs Bureau, Han Fuju, telegraphed various general sub-sections to strictly guard against this, so all the officers and soldiers along the river have been paying attention and preparing for emergencies. Although the river water is high, the works are still stable. At Kang Village upstream, the water level dropped six inches on the evening of the 13th. The main current impacted the tenth to twentieth cofferdams and side-injected the fiftieth cofferdam. Also, Wang Jinfu, the acting county magistrate of Zhencheng, telegraphed on the 12th that the river water was rising, and the main current was moving back and forth between the cofferdams, and that he was supervising the workers to add pressure, and the situation was still stable. The diversion canal dug opposite Kang Village was largely completed, and the current has been released into the canal on the morning of the 12th. The River Affairs Bureau has already telegraphed the provincial government to report this.</p>
<p>Kong Xiangrong, Chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, came to Jinan on the 10th of this month and then went to the downstream of Lijin to inspect the Luanjingzi Caiwan project. On the morning of the 11th, he went to the construction site with Deputy Chief Engineers Zhu Yong and Pan Yifen in the rain. At 6:00 PM on the 13th, he arrived at the construction site and inspected the first diversion canal of the Luanjingzi water diversion dam and the Shunguang Weizi water diversion dam and the second diversion canal. Currently, the diversion canal project has been largely completed and is being expanded to make the water discharge easier to flow smoothly. The dam construction is also progressing day and night and will be completed soon. Kong gave detailed guidance on each item of the dam construction and diversion canal project and urged the dam construction to be completed as soon as possible, so it was agreed to add 1,000 workers, add a night shift, and continue to purchase wooden piles and straw materials for defense. From the current observation of the river's current and shape, everything is very good. Once the water level is slightly higher, the water-blocking riverhead and river tail left at both ends can be opened to allow the water to flow straight down. Not only is it convenient for shipping, but the water discharge is also smooth. The completion of the reorganization of the estuary can be called a partial success. After Kong completed his inspection, he returned west with Deputy Chief Engineer Zhu and others and arrived in Jinan at 9:00 PM on the 13th. He took the Shanghai-Ping train that night to Beijing to attend the water conservancy conference. Once the conference is over, he will still return to Shandong to inspect the downstream project and inspect and guide flood prevention along the river. (13th)</p>

<p>Jinan Correspondence: Ando Heisaburo, the manager of the Jinan Japanese Shinhwa Company, was hacked to death with an axe by drug dealers Xu Gongyang, Si Rongxuan, Xie Fenggang, Li Xuezeng, and Wang Xingzhu on the night of the 23rd of last month, and four bags of heroin were robbed. They then fled one after another. After the case was reported, Shandong Governor Han Fuju immediately offered a reward of 2,000 yuan for the arrest of the fleeing criminals and ordered the military police to solve the case within ten days. The Liu Yaoting Department of the Third Road Special Detective Team and the Fourth Section of the Public Security Bureau successively arrested Xu Gongyang, who carried the axe to commit the crime, and accomplices Si Rongxuan, Li Xuezeng, and Xie Fenggang in Yucheng, Jinan, and other places. Only Wang Xingzhu was at large. They were escorted to the Public Security Bureau and then transferred to the Military Law Department of the General Headquarters for interrogation. This case has now been adjudicated. In addition to executing the principal offender Xu Gongyang by shooting, the remaining accomplices Li Xuezeng and the other three were sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment.

<h3 id="e84">The Ripple Effect of the Wuxi Silk Workers' Strike: Female Workers March and Clash, Instigators Arrested, All Factories in the County Remain on Strike <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Wuxi Correspondence: A work slowdown arose among the female silk factory workers of this county. After the party and government organs convened a meeting to mediate, they set a deadline of the 15th for all factory workers to return to work. It is now known that on that day, some of the more compliant workers had already gone to work. However, a portion of the female workers, about six or seven hundred, did not enter the factories to work when it was time to start. Instead, they set off on a march, heading to the Yongtai Silk Factory on Zhizu Bridge in the South Gate, intending to cause a disturbance. They were stopped by the police officers of the Public Security Bureau's Third Precinct, security team members, patrol units of the Public Security Bureau's Inspection Office, and river patrol units, leading to a clash and great disorder. A temporary curfew was declared in the area near the factory. The female workers then went from Yangyao Bay to Guangfu Gate, intending to petition the General Labor Union. Upon reaching Guangfu Gate, they were again stopped by police, who forbade them from entering the city to prevent any accidents. The city gates were closed. At the same time, female workers in the Eastern Gate area also clashed with the police, and the Eastern Gate was also closed. Later, the entire police force dispersed the female workers, averting a major disaster. After about half an hour, the city gates were reopened. Another group of workers gathered at the Silk Factory Industry Labor Union, demanding relief. They were also driven out by the security brigade's Second Squad. The various precincts increased the number of guards at each city gate to maintain order. The county government, concerned about the expanding strike, issued a strict prohibition. At the same time, it ordered the Chief of Political Police, Wu Zhengrong, to lead political police Xie Xiaodi and other Public Security Bureau officers to arrest Gao Dehua, a suspect in instigating the strike, in Zhou Shanbang, and Lu Liangqing in Wanqian Road. Ge Xinde, an inspector of the Public Security Bureau, also arrested Xu Tangshi. All were taken to the county government. In the afternoon at 4:00 PM, Section Chief Li Duxuan held a court hearing and ordered them to be transferred to the Second District Commissioner's Office for further investigation. The representatives of the Silk Factory Industry Labor Union, Ye Qiaoyun and others, numbering over ten, believed that this strike was instigated by a Land Commissioner from the county party headquarters, so they turned him over to the county government for disposal. The Second District Commissioner's Office ordered the county government to strictly arrest the ringleaders and to enforce a resumption of work within a specified period. However, the workers insisted that they could only resume work after the party and government resolved the conditions they had put forth. Therefore, all the silk factories in the county remained on strike.</p>

The following is a summary of the main points: "Today, as a representative of the China Scientific Movement Association, I am here to broadcast. I chose this topic, but it is very broad. Due to time constraints, I cannot go into detail. I intend to focus on the important points of the National Economic Construction Movement and promote them using scientific methods. This is just a small contribution of my opinion. I hope the listeners will correct any omissions or inaccuracies. If a country wants to exist on this earth, it must have a goal, rally its people, and lead the entire nation together onto the ideal path. This ideal path is the one that suits the country's environmental needs. For example, before the European War, the Germans aimed to dominate the world by force. After the Meiji Restoration, the Japanese aimed to compete for hegemony in East Asia. The Americans aimed to maintain the Monroe Doctrine. The British aimed to hold the reins of world commerce. Although their goals were different, they were all striving for self-preservation. The one thing they had in common was that they wanted the whole country to work together to achieve this goal and continue to maintain it. Today, the most dangerous thing for China is economic bankruptcy. The way to save the country is not to resist the enemy, but to focus on economic construction. Therefore, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, seeing this, launched the National Economic Construction Movement, a head-on blow, like a bright light in a dark sea, setting this as the goal for the entire nation. It is the only effective remedy for revival in this day and age. However, having good goals and good talents, it is necessary to have good methods to use and promote them in order to see results. What are these methods? They are to promote them based on scientific principles. This is the actual topic I will talk about today. The slogan of the Scientific Movement Association is to use scientific methods to organize our country's inherent culture, to use scientific knowledge to enrich our country's current society, and to use the scientific spirit to create our country's future life. It is also said that scientific socialization and social scientification, in other words, use known scientific knowledge and methods to organize or create all past and future undertakings in society. For example, both Japan and Russia use scientific methods to build everything, rather than relying solely on scientific inventions to do construction work. There are two main points in our country's economic construction: (1) To enable the nation to be self-sufficient in common daily necessities such as rice, wheat, cotton, steel, and oil, in order to reduce imports. (2) To increase the export volume of our country's unique products such as furs, tung oil, silk, tea, soybeans, nickel, antimony, and tin, in order to balance imports. There are two principles: one is to develop basic industries and transportation construction, which should be promoted by the state or organizations, and the other is to promote agricultural production and small-scale industries, which should be promoted by the people. There are two steps: one is to have existing talents go deep into the people, cooperate and cooperate, publicize and guide, to correct long-standing habits, and the other is to cultivate talents to continue the movement in an ordinary and orderly manner. Because our country's economic construction is different from that of Soviet Russia. Soviet Russia has a foundation for its industry, and its people are accustomed to scientific training. Therefore, its construction plans can be successful in years. The knowledge of our people is superficial, and they lack organization. Therefore, starting economic construction cannot be done quickly, but must be done with steady and arduous means. Here are a few examples to illustrate how to promote our country's economic work using scientific methods. Hu then described in detail the steps and methods of the four construction movements of agriculture, industry, mining, and transportation, citing various statistics as proof of the facts. Finally, he said that the scientific movement should pay attention to the following four key points in order to achieve the goal of economic construction. The so-called four essentials are (1) regarding finance, (2) regarding organization, (3) regarding talent, and (4) regarding laws and regulations. Hu's segmented discussion was extremely detailed.</p>

<p>Wang Zuxun, chairman of the local Chamber of Commerce, stated that the Sujia Railway is scheduled to begin passenger train service on July 15th. However, the Wujiang station's platform canopy and over-track overpass have not yet been built. If passengers encounter rain while boarding, they will have nowhere to take shelter. Moreover, crossing the tracks to the opposite platform is extremely dangerous. Yesterday, he specifically telegraphed the directors of the Two Railways Bureau, Director Huang, requesting that the Engineering Department be promptly ordered to plan and construct them as soon as possible to benefit travelers.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Suzhou: Concubine Murdered by Paramour <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>On the morning of the 14th, a nude female corpse, with brick wounds and signs of strangulation, was discovered in a rice field in the Youcheqiao area of Sukun Road outside Qimen in Suzhou. Next to the corpse was a seven- or eight-year-old girl, seriously injured but not yet dead. That day, the court conducted an autopsy and sent the injured child to the Gospel Hospital for treatment. After this case occurred, it caused a sensation throughout Suzhou. The Public Security Bureau also immediately sent detectives to investigate the perpetrator. It is now known that the deceased, Ms. Xia, was 34 years old and the wife of Ji Zhongyuan, a rickshaw businessman at No. 63 Lindun Road in the city. Ji is 34 years old, from Qingjiang, and used to live in Qiaosikong Alley. He earned a decent living by renting out rickshaws. He married Ms. Xia in 1925. The injured girl, named Gendi, is nine years old and Ms. Xia's daughter. The family of three lived happily together. Ji had two friends, Yin Amao and Chen Asheng from Chuansha, who jointly opened the Chen Senji Construction Factory in Dongyue Temple in Zhenjiang. Amao had recently become involved with Ms. Xia. On the 11th of this month, Amao came to Ji's home from Zhenjiang, claiming that the construction factory he had established had contracted to build houses near Sukun Road and was willing to pay Ji a monthly salary of 18 yuan to hire him as an accountant. Ji did not agree. That night, Amao stayed at Ji's home. The next day (the 12th), Ms. Xia and her daughter Gendi claimed to be going out to buy groceries, but they disappeared with Amao at the same time. When Ms. Xia left, she was wearing a dark silk cheongsam. As for the reason for the murder, it is suspected that although Ms. Xia left with Amao, she regretted betraying her husband and quarreled with him, leading to her death. The deceased's body has been autopsied and claimed by Ji for burial. The Public Security Bureau is currently sending out detectives to investigate the perpetrator, Yin Amao.</p>

<p>The Dinghai County Government, in order to facilitate communication with the various islands, plans to establish shortwave radio stations in Zhoushan, Daishan, Qushan, Putuo, Liuheng, Jintang, and other places. It submitted a request to the Provincial Government's Department of Civil Affairs and Department of Construction for approval. However, the original plan was to use five 5-watt shortwave transmitters. The order was changed to use a 5-watt shortwave transceiver and a three-tube shortwave receiver. As for the management personnel, two specialized technicians have been hired, and five police officers have been selected for training. The total start-up cost is more than 2,500 yuan. The equipment will be purchased and transported by a construction company. The five police officers are currently being actively trained so that they can start communicating as soon as the equipment is installed.</p>

<p>The largest water conservancy project in Jiangsu Province this year is the opening of the new canal in the coastal reclamation area. Several months have passed since the entire staff of the surveying team set out to survey. Although it is now hot weather, the surveying work is still actively underway. The Department of Construction previously reported that the 150 kilometers from the He Duo River to the Zhan Huang River have now been surveyed and is currently engaged in design and drawing to determine the basis for implementation. The remaining sections will continue to be surveyed in order to complete the project as scheduled. The Department of Construction is carefully planning this project, and it has not yet been determined whether a separate agency will be established to handle it in the future.</p>

<p>The Daokou River outside the West Gate of Yangzhou connects to the outer river. The river is wide and deep, and fishermen regard it as a habitat. Many people fish with nets and hooks. Yesterday (the 13th), a fisherman named Zhang Changyi caught a turtle in that location. Its shell was as black as iron, and its four feet had white hair. It weighed more than eighty pounds. Old fishermen said it was a century-old creature. It was purchased by an elderly man for five yuan, who said he intended to send it to the Shanghai Zoo for feeding. According to Zhang Yumen, a medical researcher, the glue made from this turtle can be taken to prolong life.</p>

<p>Farmers in the Gualuzhou Balipu to Yangziqiao area of the second district of Jiangdu gathered to protect the dike. On the 16th, they detained more than twenty tugboats from various companies going upstream and downstream. Finally, at 6:00 PM, they reached an agreement to release the towlines and let them go. It is now known that since yesterday (the 13th), the Fourth District Department of Water Police sent Captain Dai, along with the Shipping Association, the Transportation Bureau, and representatives from the various shipping bureaus, together with local people and the local township chiefs, to negotiate with the dike-protecting people on two traffic solutions: (1) Within the scope stipulated by the Transportation Bureau's water level, each upper and lower wheel will be towed alongside the slow lane. (2) If the water level exceeds the scope stipulated by the Transportation Bureau, the upstream wheels will dock at the Fourth District Department's door, the downstream wheels will dock at Yangziqiao, and the tugs will be pulled to the docking place to exchange tows to avoid the risk of flushing the dike.</p>

<p>Recently, rice mills have been raising rice prices step by step due to the limited amount of rice stored during this time when the old crop is running out and the new crop is not yet harvested, coupled with the hot weather, which makes it difficult to ship goods. Each shi has increased by 8 jiao and will continue to increase. On the 12th, glutinous rice was 13.2 yuan per shi, dwarf xian snow tip was 12.6 yuan, red shell tip rice was 11.8 yuan, and red brown rice was 11 yuan.</p>

<p>Since the Three North Housen Salt Barn in Yuyao Dongxiang was closed last year, the Yaochang people have accumulated salt and have been unable to sell it, which has cut off their livelihoods. As a result, they repeatedly requested the Yaochang Administration to establish a people's salt barn.

<p>The smuggling of private sugar to the south for dumping has recently continued unabated. Although there have been repeated seizures here, unscrupulous merchants are still selling it secretly. The Bengbu Public Security Bureau recently received a tip that the Rintai, Yongfeng, and Xiehe sugar and paper stores on Jingyi Road in this city had private sugar hidden and were selling it secretly. They dispatched long-term police officers to investigate on the 13th. They found 183 bags of Dong sugar and 184 bags of Taigu sugar in Rintai, 50 bags of Dong sugar and 425 bags of Taigu sugar in Yongfeng, and 303 bags of Dong sugar and 319 bags of Taigu sugar in Xiehe. However, the store owners of the three sugar and paper stores firmly denied that it was private sugar. For the sake of caution, the Public Security Bureau extracted a portion of the seized sugar and sent it to the Bengbu Inspection Office of the Customs for forwarding to Nanjing for testing. All the sugar seized was sealed in the respective stores and will not be moved temporarily. It will be verified after the examination and identification.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Crackdown on Geisha's Unconventional Clothing <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>After the public prostitutes here were renamed geishas, regardless of whether they were from the Suzhou, Yangzhou, Qing, or Huai gangs, there was no longer a name for prostitutes. Recently, the New Transport Promotion Association believed that most of the geishas in the city were wearing strange and unconventional clothing, which was a great loss of simplicity, and that some were wearing white hats and short skirts, imitating the dress of female students, and should be cracked down on. A method of correction was specifically discussed, and the Public Security Bureau was requested to order geishas' clothing to be simple, with red trim on the clothes for identification, and to prohibit dressing up as female students in order to maintain customs. After approving the letter, the Public Security Bureau often ordered the sub-bureaus to notify all the geishas in the city to comply with the shares and not to disobey. Upon hearing the news, the geishas believed that the red trim on their clothes was a matter of face and mostly adopted a wait-and-see attitude and refused to comply. The general pimps held a meeting at noon on the 12th to discuss how to deal with the situation. They decided to comply with the order not to allow geishas to wear white hats or dress up as female students, but they would appeal to the Public Security Bureau regarding the red trim on their clothes, which was a matter of face, and request that the order be withdrawn. They also felt that the geishas' monthly donation of 10 yuan was too heavy and planned to request the authorities to reduce it appropriately in order to alleviate their hardships. It is said that the Public Security Bureau is determined to implement the crackdown on geisha clothing, otherwise, it will not count even if all the geishas go on strike.</p>

<p>Station Security</p>
<p>The authorities in this city, in order to protect the Central Committee members who came to Shanghai after the closing of the Plenary Session, dispatched a large number of security teams to enforce security measures at the North Station and Zhenru. Mayor Wu got off the train in Zhenru and returned to his private residence on Haig Road to rest. At around 9:00 AM, he went to the Municipal Government to work. Wang, Xu, Cai, and others got off the train at the North Station and returned to their respective residences. Wang went directly to Wei Daoming's residence on Haig Road to rest briefly. At around 8:30 AM, he went out with his secretary, Feng Zhizheng, to Wang Aishong's medical clinic to have his nose examined.</p>
<p>Wang's Remarks</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice Agency met the members at the station. According to Wang Chonghui, the impression that the meeting gave us can be summarized in two words: "very good." The problem of the current situation can be solved easily. As for whether it is possible to avoid military action in cleaning up the mess in Guangdong Province, it is not yet certain, but we hope that it can be avoided. I returned to Shanghai immediately because the weather in Beijing was too hot and my nose disease had not healed, so I need to continue to see a doctor. I plan to go to Qingdao to escape the heat in the future, but I have not yet decided on a date. I may make another trip to Beijing before going to Qingdao.</p>
<p>Xu and Cai's Remarks</p>
<p>Xu Chongzhi said that regarding the resolution of the situation in Guangdong Province, after the decision of the Second Plenary Session, the Military Affairs Commission appointed Yu Hanmou as the successor to the Resident Guangdong Pacification Director, responsible for cleaning up the mess. Yu has now returned to his defense, but it is difficult to predict whether it will be resolved peacefully in the future without resorting to military action. Cai Yuanpei said that the military forces can be avoided in cleaning up the Guangdong situation. The expressions of Zhang Zhiben and others were generally the same.</p>

<p>Huang Linshu, director of the Guangdong Provincial Department of Education and one of the five Central Committee members from the Southwest who attended the Second Plenary Session in the North, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday and boarded the Changxing Company's Canadian Empress ship from the Gonghexiang Wharf on East Broadway Road at 5:30 PM yesterday with his secretary, Li Mengqing, and left Shanghai to return south. Li Fulin, a Central Committee member from Hong Kong, returned to Hong Kong on the same ship. Li Renren and Li Qi'an also arrived in Shanghai on the night express train at around 7:00 AM yesterday and stayed at the New Asia Hotel on Tiantong Road, waiting for Deng Qingyang and Cui Guangxi to arrive in Shanghai this morning before joining them on their return south. Huang told a reporter from the New Voice Agency on the ship that he had been away from Guangdong for more than ten days and that he knew little about the situation in Guangdong. Everything would be known after he returned to Guangdong. He had no comments on the abolition of the two agencies in the Southwest and the appointment of General Yu (Hanmou) as the Resident Guangdong Pacification Director. He had the same feeling about the Second Plenary Session as everyone else. He will convey the progress of the conference to the people in Guangdong after returning to Guangdong this time.</p>

<p>Regarding the issue of Chen Jitang sending personnel to the Guangzhou Branch of the Bank of China on the 14th to forcefully withdraw customs tax deposits, a reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed Song Ziwen, chairman of the bank, yesterday morning. Song said that he had been away from Shanghai for many days and had just arrived in Shanghai, and was busy with affairs, so he sent someone to meet him on his behalf. It is said that the annual customs tax revenue of the Guangdong Customs Office is 17 to 18 million yuan, all of which is deposited in the Guangzhou Branch of the Bank of China. Smuggling in North China has been rampant for the past six months, and the Guangdong Customs Office's tax revenue has naturally decreased. The current deposit in the Guangzhou Branch is as high as 8 to 9 million yuan. Unexpectedly, Chen Jitang sent personnel to the bank on the 14th, strongly requesting to withdraw it. The branch authorities refused, arguing that Chen's actions did not comply with the bank's business regulations, and reported it to Shanghai by telegram, stating that Chen's strong desire to withdraw the customs tax was not only related to the national treasury, but also to foreign debt guarantees, which was also of great importance. For the sake of performing its duties, the bank is determined to do its best to protect it. As of noon on the 15th, Chen had not yet seized it. All branches of the Bank of China in Guangdong Province are still operating normally. It is also known that the exchange rate between Shanghai and Guangdong silver dollars is 600 yuan, which is another 10 yuan lower than yesterday.</p>

<p>Those from Shanghai who participated in the opening ceremony included Fan Shouzhi, secretary-general of the railway bureau; Xiao Weiguo, chief of the transportation department; Wang Zhigang, deputy chief of the transportation department; Cao Xinzhi, deputy chief of the general affairs department; Wang Bi, chief of the mechanical department; Wu Naixian, chief of the police department; Wu Xihan, chief of the documentation section; and over twenty people including reporters from the Central News Agency. They departed from the North Station at 4:45 AM yesterday morning on a specially prepared train to Suzhou, arriving at Suzhou at 6:40 AM. There, they met with Huang Boqiao, director of both railway bureaus, Zhou Wuyi, special commissioner of the Ministry of Railways, who had arrived in Suzhou the previous day, and dozens of reporters from Suzhou newspapers. At 7:20 AM, they were attached to the first passenger train from Suzhou to Jiaxing. There were no particular ceremonies at the opening, only the national flag of the Kuomintang was affixed to the head of the train, and the band of the Wuxian Public Safety Bureau accompanied the train, playing music. It was very simple.</p>
<p>Scenery Along the Way</p>
<p>The Sujia Railway is 74.44 kilometers long and has 99 bridges and culverts. The construction cost was approximately 3 million yuan. There are eight stations: Wuxian (Suzhou), Xiangmen, Wujiang, Bachai, Pingwang, Shengze, Wangjiangjing, and Jiaxing. Because it is newly built and the roadbed is not yet solid, the train travels at only 30 kilometers per hour. This route runs parallel to the original Sujia Highway and the canal. The highway and canal are interwoven on both sides of the railway. The platforms at each station, with the exception of the offices, have been completed, but other facilities are still under construction. The area along the line can be said to be the most prosperous in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. As far as the eye can see, there are mulberry gardens, rice paddies, and lakes. At each station, residents came and went in droves, gathering outside the station to watch. Although yesterday was the first day of operation, there were approximately two hundred passengers boarding and alighting in each direction. The Sujia Highway bus was greatly affected. It is said that fares have been reduced by 20% of the original price. However, trains are stable and fast, and it is feared that most passengers will eventually abandon highway buses.</p>
<p>Touring the Lake in the Rain</p>
<p>At 10:15 AM, the train arrived in Jiaxing. They braved the rain to leave the station and first went to the railway bureau's nursery for a short rest, where they were warmly received by the field director. They then took a yacht to Yanyu Tower for a banquet. Wang Xianqiang, special commissioner of the Jiaxing district, was also invited to attend. During the banquet, Director Huang reported on the construction process, followed by a speech by Commissioner Wang, who stated that the opening of the Sujia line would further develop Jiaxing's transportation and promote the development of local construction. In the future, efforts should be made to develop local construction to promote the perfection of transportation. Finally, Jin Shixuan, representative of the Ministry of Railways, reported the Ministry of Railways' determination to complete the Jinghu-Hangzhou line. At 2:00 PM, they boarded small boats to tour the lake. At around 4:10 PM, Director Huang and the reporters returned to Shanghai on the Shanghai-Hangzhou train. Many reporters from Suzhou took the Sujia train back.</p>
<p>Start of Business</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration issued a public announcement regarding the opening of the Sujia Railway: The Bureau is managing the Sujia Railway on behalf of the Ministry of Railways, and it will open for business on July 15th of this year.

<h3 id="e109">Machine Manufacturers Association Petitions Shaanxi Provincial Government to Reward the Promotion of Domestic Goods in the Northwest; Requests Revision of Tax Rates and Exemption of Surcharges; Calculation Based on Cost Price, Do Not Arbitrarily Assess Value <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Machine-Made Domestic Goods Manufacturers Association yesterday submitted a petition to the Shaanxi Provincial Government to reward the promotion of domestic goods in the Northwest. The original text states, "Submitting this petition with three points, earnestly requesting approval, in order to reward domestic goods and promote sales in the Northwest. We have received a letter from Sanyou Industrial Company, a member, stating, 'Our client, Zhongnan Store in Xi'an, Shaanxi, has been distributing domestic goods for a long time, and has been working hard to promote your company's products. However, the collection of special consumption taxes in Shaanxi Province is biased, with no fixed rules. Often, daily necessities of very little value are taxed at a rate exceeding the highest tax rate of modern national taxes, causing excellent domestic goods to fail to penetrate the interior and instead giving foreign goods the opportunity to dump, which is deeply regrettable. The Shanghai Machine-Made Domestic Goods Manufacturers Association is a group of domestic goods factories in our country, and your company has been a member for many years and has been committed to the domestic goods business for decades, so you must pay close attention to this. The fact that special taxes make it difficult for domestic goods to sell well is a difficulty that domestic goods factories in the Machine-Made Domestic Goods Manufacturers Association will encounter when promoting in the Northwest. Therefore, we have some humble opinions and ask you to convey them to the Machine-Made Domestic Goods Manufacturers Association to forward to the Shaanxi authorities to provide opportunities for Machine-Made Domestic Goods Manufacturers Association member factories to promote their products. The following points are listed for your consideration and implementation: (1) Re-determine the tax rate, and all products from Shanghai Machine-Made Domestic Goods Manufacturers Association member factories shall be assessed according to the production cost of goods in Shanghai, and taxed at a percentage to avoid the disadvantages of being biased. The price list shall be compiled and submitted by the Machine-Made Domestic Goods Manufacturers Association to avoid the malpractice of being biased; (2) Require exemption of surcharges to reward the smooth sale of domestic goods in the Northwest; (3) All products from Shanghai Machine-Made Domestic Goods Manufacturers Association member factories transported to the province shall be certified by the association to ensure that there are no fake goods or rebranding, so that customs inspection procedures can be eliminated after arriving in Shaanxi to benefit merchants (because local tax authorities often consider domestic goods to be fake goods). The above points should be forwarded to the Machine-Made Domestic Goods Manufacturers Association for handling, so that all domestic goods factories in Shanghai who are determined to develop the Northwest will quickly rise up and go to operate, and the heavy tax burden will be relieved by this move. We await your orders." Based on this, it is true that the rigorous collection of special taxes in Shaanxi Province, which increases the cost of goods, is one of the reasons why domestic goods are difficult to sell well in the Northwest. The points raised by the store are not without reason. This matter concerns the promotion of domestic goods, and a special letter is forwarded to you, requesting that your association submit a petition on its behalf to the extent possible to facilitate the development of domestic goods. The affection for our friendship has reached the association. After reviewing the points to be noted when revising the Shaanxi Special Consumption Tax Rate, point six states, "For goods not listed in this tax rate table, and other goods can be used for reference to levy taxes without being unfair, they shall be handled temporarily, but the name, origin, use, and cost price of the goods shall be described in detail and submitted for approval, and arbitrary valuation shall not be allowed to cause malpractice." From this, it can be seen that your province's Department of Finance is very strict in approving tax rates and is considerate of business conditions. However, the collecting agencies often do not follow the provisions but submit them for approval, and arbitrarily compare and levy taxes on goods that are not listed in the tax rate, which is inevitable. Otherwise, how could daily necessities of very little value be taxed at a rate exceeding the highest tax rate of modern tariffs? For example, the Wudi Soap Factory's No. 2 Butterfly Soap, with a selling price of four jiao per dozen, is subject to special consumption tax and surcharges on decorative items such as soap by the collecting agency to a huge amount of three jiao and six fen, which is obvious. Now, according to Sanyou Industrial Company, we have received a letter from Zhongnan Store in Xi'an requesting three points, which are indeed a way to reward domestic goods and promote sales in the Northwest. We should combine the list of members with a document and submit a petition, hoping that your government will approve it and eliminate the gap between government and business invisibly, and the future of domestic goods will be promising. I am overwhelmed with anticipation."</p>
<h3 id="e110">Ministry of Finance Issues Instructions on Stamp Tax on Notification Slips; Exempt for Those Not Used for Picking Up Goods <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>After the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to request instructions on whether notification slips used by the forwarding industry between the departure station company and the arrival station company should be stamped, yesterday the Ministry of Finance issued Tax No. 10051, stating, "The telegram and sample copies have been received. After investigation, if the forwarding industry has already provided a bill of lading to the consignor to pick up the goods at the arrival station, then the arrival station company can deliver the goods based on this bill of lading, so there is no need to create another notification slip. Moreover, the various items listed in this notification slip are no different from the provisions that should be included in the bill of lading, so it is possible to replace the bill of lading and give it to the customer to pick up the goods. However, since it is claimed that this notification slip is for the relationship between the departure station company and the arrival station company, and is not given to the customer for picking up goods, then in the future, if this notification slip is found, if it can immediately produce a bill of lading with the same content as the notification slip and has been stamped with sufficient stamp duty in accordance with the law, it can be exempted from stamp duty; otherwise, it should still be handled in accordance with item 13 of the tax rate table, Bill of Lading, to prevent taking advantage. Please forward these instructions for compliance."</p>

<h3 id="e115">Overseas Merchant Chen Bingding Talks About Improving Agriculture and Food; Methods of Planting Cassava and Mountain Millet <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Overseas merchant Chen Bingding cares about the agriculture of his motherland. He recently submitted a memorial to the Ministry of Industry to reform planting methods. Because the original written opinion omitted the planting methods of cassava and mountain millet, he supplemented the conversation as follows: Our country has a vast territory, and there are barren mountains and remote areas everywhere. If we can use wasteland to plant mountain millet and cassava, it will greatly benefit the people's food supply. The planting methods of cassava and mountain millet are briefly described as follows: (1) Cassava (tapioca starch, sago) The original tree is seven or eight feet tall, and the trunk is straight. The seeds are available in Nanyang, Java, Taiwan, and Guangxi, and the price is very low. Each plant costs only one or two fen to transport to our country. If our people cultivate them themselves, half a fen is enough. The planting method is very easy. In the spring season, cut the branches of the original tree, half a foot long, use barren mountains, remove weeds, turn the soil more than a foot deep, and bury the cut branches into the soil about two inches deep, with a horizontal and vertical distance of one foot per plant. Following the Javanese planting method can avoid fertilization and often pay attention to weeding. After eight months, the harvest can be made, with each plant producing more than ten catties, followed by four or five catties, and the lowest grade also producing one or two catties. Bingding tried planting Javanese seeds in his hometown, and after nearly a year, each plant yielded up to thirteen catties, with excellent quality, far superior to our country's sweet potatoes. Moreover, the tree reproduces extremely quickly. If a family plants ten plants, then after eight months, they can be divided into more than one hundred and sixty plants, and after another eight months, they can be divided into more than two thousand plants. (2) Mountain Millet (dry rice) Use barren mountains, remove weeds, and turn the soil more than half a foot deep. In early spring, first use sharpened bamboo to dig holes in the soil, about an inch deep, and place four or five seeds in each hole, cover them with soil evenly, and the horizontal and vertical distance of each hole is four or five inches wide. Following the Javanese planting method can also avoid fertilization and only add weeding. After four months, the harvest can be made. The rice quality is harder than paddy rice. After harvesting, it is best to leave the stalks in place and burn them to nourish the land. Java has mountain millet seeds, and the price is not expensive, with each dan worth about eight yuan in our country. The above two foods are easy to sow and the cost is light. Once reproduced, they will greatly benefit the future of the people's food supply, and perhaps the tens of millions of yuan of food imports that are leaked every year can be salvaged somewhat.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Postal Savings Bureau Decides to Add Safe Deposit Box Services <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>After deciding to add safe deposit box services, the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau yesterday sent letters to various institutions and organizations, and also stipulated rental rules and prices. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Letter to Various Institutions</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of offering safety deposit boxes, Shanghai's prosperity is unmatched in the country, and wealth from all directions converges here. Gold glitters, easily tempting the covetous hearts of petty thieves. Daytime robbery is a constant reminder of the need for vigilance in the city. Although local police patrols are generally thorough, it is difficult for people to be completely prepared. Therefore, the safety deposit box business arises from social needs. The rental fees are limited, but the safety of property is ensured. Ordinary people are eagerly renting them as a way to ensure safety. Our municipal government agencies, as well as the deeds, contracts, duplicate keys, valuables, etc. of public and private organizations are all important. Rather than building separate vaults or installing large iron cabinets, which would cost a lot of money and still not completely solve the safety problem, it would be wiser to use safety deposit boxes as storage places. Our bureau moved to the new Construction Building at the beginning of last month and added the safety deposit box business. We have already made a public announcement and invite your attention. Our bureau is located next to the police station, a prime location. The safety deposit vault we built has a precise structure and a spacious scale. It is equipped with 2,000 steel-made safety deposit boxes of various sizes, most of which have inner boxes. They are sturdily manufactured and have a novel style. Deposits and withdrawals are convenient, rental fees are low, and procedures are simple. In addition to providing rental services for individuals and companies, we are willing to serve various institutions and organizations wholeheartedly. We ask for your consideration.</p>
<p>Rental Rules</p>
<p>Article 1: The rental of safety deposit boxes by this bureau is subject to the Shanghai Municipal Safety Deposit Box Rental Regulations. However, those which should be specified by this bureau are specially stipulated in these regulations. Article 2: The rental fees for safety deposit boxes are detailed in the attached table. Article 3: The key deposit is set at 20 yuan in national currency per box. Article 4: The handling fee for reissuing a key deposit receipt is set at 50 cents in national currency. Article 5: If the renter loses one key, in addition to following Article 11 of the Shanghai Municipal Safety Deposit Box Rental Regulations, the renter shall immediately return the remaining key to this bureau and pay a compensation fee of 6 yuan in national currency. If the renter loses all the keys, the renter shall compensate this bureau 20 yuan in national currency, and this bureau will replace the lock to avoid danger. Article 6: If the items in the safety deposit box need to be sealed and stored by this bureau due to the circumstances in Article 17 of the Shanghai Municipal Safety Deposit Box Rental Regulations, the storage fee shall be calculated by this bureau in accordance with the regulations. Article 7: If the renter does not return both keys and retrieve the items after the rental period has expired or the rental has been terminated, the overdue rental fee shall be calculated as six months if it is less than six months, and as one year if it is more than six months. Article 8: These rules may be modified at any time without notice.</p>

<h3 id="e118">Forcible Relocation of Shantytowns in Eastern Shanghai: Municipal Council Agrees to Flexible Handling. Shantytown Residents Appeal to All Parties Again, Requesting the Speedy Construction of Public Housing. <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the case of the Public Concession Municipal Council forcing the relocation of shantytowns in Eastern Shanghai, after mediation by Yu Qiaqing, the Municipal Council Board of Directors has agreed to handle it flexibly. Shantytown residents have once again appealed to all parties. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Mediates for Flexible Handling</p>
<p>Based on the request of the shantytown residents, Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing conducted mediation at the Municipal Council Board of Directors meeting yesterday afternoon. The following measures were decided: (1) No further increase in shantytowns shall be allowed; (2) One person shall be designated as responsible for guaranteeing every ten households. If any additional construction is discovered, all ten households will be demolished; (3) The shantytown residents shall conduct a survey of the total population and report it to the Municipal Council; (4) Fully responsible representatives shall be designated in each district. All of the above have been accepted by both parties. Therefore, the General Affairs Department of the Municipal Council, which previously stated that demolition would resume on the 15th, did not send personnel yesterday because the matter had reached a stage of resolution.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Petitions the Municipal Government for Negotiations</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce submitted a petition to the municipal government yesterday, stating, "Regarding the matter of submitting a petition, the chamber recently received a joint letter from the shantytown residents of Eastern Shanghai, stating that the concession authorities have set a deadline for the demolition of their shacks, leaving them with nowhere to live, and requesting assistance. It is said that there are nearly 50 families who are facing this deadline for demolition, while the letter from the shantytown residents this time claims that there are more than 10,000 households, which will become a serious problem for the poor people living in this city. This matter cannot be ignored. However, merely making empty appeals for postponement may be rejected by the concession authorities. After careful consideration, the only way to solve the problem is for your government to discuss the matter with the Municipal Council and clarify the measures to be taken. We will gradually increase the number of public housing units each year. Each year, a certain number of public housing units will be added, and the concession will limit the demolition of a certain number of shantytowns, so that there will be a way to accommodate them and they will not have to worry about losing their homes. For the time being, please postpone the demolition. Is this appropriate? We hereby submit a document to your government for review and approval, as it is in the public interest."</p>
<p>Shantytown Residents Appeal to All Parties Again</p>
<p>Yesterday, the shantytown residents sent representatives Zhang Buyun, Yin Yifu, Tang Anping, etc., to report the situation to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. They were received by Secretary Zhu Boyuan, who advised the shantytown residents to live in peace. In the afternoon, they went to the First Special District Citizens' Federation to petition, where they were received by Chen Jiufeng. The shantytown residents said that the Municipal Council's move was illegal: (1) Because Yanshan Road has not been built, if they want to force the relocation, they should build it first and install the utility poles; (2) The landowner must build houses before they can order the relocation; (3) The Municipal Council should build public housing before they can force the relocation. Mr. Chen replied that he would negotiate for a postponement of the demolition and urge the Municipal Council to build public housing, starting with registering rickshaw pullers to improve the lives of workers.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Zhou Zuomin and Others Take Over the China Shipbuilding Factory, Change to a Limited Liability Company, and Appoint Sheng Pingru as Manager. <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The Greater China Shipbuilding Factory (located east of Dinghai Bridge, near the Fishery Market, founded by shipbuilding expert Yang Junsheng, has been in operation for more than ten years. It has had excellent achievements in the past, such as the Xin Dada Wheel of Dada Company, the Tianxing Wheel of Tianjin Shipping Company, and the Jiangxi Zhongzheng Bridge (over 1,000 feet long), all of which were built by the factory. Therefore, its technology, materials, and workmanship have long been trusted by Chinese shipowners. However, it did not pay much attention to business management, which led to the factory's grounding last year. As a result, it owed more than 530,000 yuan to various parties. After several lawsuits, the court convened a meeting of creditors and, in accordance with the bankruptcy law, repaid the creditors a certain percentage. The creditors agreed, and the dispute came to an end. The machinery, equipment, and various projects of the Greater China Shipbuilding Factory are very complete, and it is the best of the Chinese-owned shipyards in Shanghai. It is a pity that it was suspended due to debt. Mr. Yang is willing to transfer the factory to Chinese people to continue operating, and has negotiated with Zhou Zuomin, the general director of Jin Cheng Bank, Fan Xudong, the owner of Jiuda Refined Salt Company, and Lu Zuofu, the director of the Sichuan Construction Department and the general manager of Minsheng Industrial Company, to take over the new factory. Mr. Yang and Zhou Zuomin were classmates in Dongying (Japan). Now, Zhou, Fan, Lu, and others believe that shipbuilding is the largest industry, and Shanghai should have a large-scale, Chinese-owned commercial shipyard to benefit shipping. Therefore, they have agreed. The procedures for taking over and the formal contract have been signed by both parties, and the factory will be taken over immediately. However, the new shareholders have decided to make the factory a joint-stock company, so the name has also been changed to "China Shipbuilding Machinery Factory Co., Ltd." It will be reorganized. Zhou Zuomin will serve as the chairman of the new factory, and Fan Xudong and Lu Zuofu will serve as managing directors. Shipbuilding engineering expert Sheng Pingru has been specially appointed as the manager, and it has been decided that the position of assistant manager will still be held by the original founder, Yang Junsheng. This was decided on the 1st of this month. The handover is currently in progress. The manager's office will be located on the upper floor of Jin Cheng Bank. Manager Sheng has negotiated with the Huangpu River Conservancy Board and agreed to dredge the waterline in front of the factory to facilitate the construction of large ships. From now on, the factory will have the strong financial power of major industrialists and financiers, as well as the expert planning of Sheng Pingru. The future is truly limitless. In the shortest possible time, it has been decided to add a dry dock and expand the business. This is truly good news for China's shipping industry.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Telegram from the National Postal Workers' Union Regarding the Number of Representatives to the National Assembly <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The National Postal Workers' Union is sending a telegram to all relevant institutions and public organizations throughout the country, requesting them to uphold justice regarding the fact that "the number of representatives from the postal workers' union has not yet been stipulated in the National Assembly Representative Election Law." The telegram is addressed to: All ministries and departments of the National Government, the Central Party Headquarters, the governments of all provinces, cities, and counties, party headquarters at all levels, the General Office for the Election of Representatives to the National Assembly, all institutions and public organizations throughout the country, and compatriots from all walks of life: The National Assembly is the central hub of national public opinion. All members of the public should be able to elect representatives to participate in accordance with the law, so as to pool their wisdom and efforts to promote the constitution. Our postal workers' union has been established for more than ten years. All provinces, cities, and counties throughout the country have strict and sound organizations. Under the concrete guidance of the central and local party and government organs and the command and supervision of the National Postal Workers' Union, it has long made practical achievements for the party, the country, the postal service, and society. The facts are clear and need not be repeated. However, the National Assembly Representative Election Law and its implementing regulations promulgated by the Executive Yuan do not provide for the representation of the postal workers' union. Even special unions, such as railway and maritime workers, can participate as representatives, while the postal workers' union is excluded from the law. Such disregard for the revolutionary history and legal rights of 36,000 postal workers nationwide is not only a departure from the legislative fairness of the legislators themselves, but also something that our postal workers nationwide cannot remain silent about. Therefore, after deliberation by the National Postal Workers' Union, we have submitted a document to the National Government, the Military Affairs Commission, the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the Central Party Headquarters, and the General Office for the Election of Representatives to the National Assembly, requesting a revision of the number of representatives to show the sincere desire of the union to lead postal workers nationwide in supporting the constitution. The original submission is recorded below: "It has been found that according to the Implementing Rules of the National Assembly Representatives Election Law, only the railway and maritime unions are included as representatives of special unions, and the postal workers' union is completely excluded, which is perplexing and incomprehensible. Originally, it was based on the Organizational Regulations for Special Unions and the Organizational System Table for Special Unions promulgated by the 157th Standing Committee of the Second Session of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, and the 154th Central Standing Committee. We proceeded in accordance with them, which was in compliance with laws and regulations. Later, the Central Government cancelled the above-mentioned regulations and system table because the Trade Union Law had already been promulgated. The Association, in view of the precedents of the maritime and railway special unions, and in view of the fact that the Trade Union Law was not applicable to special unions, repeatedly suggested to the Central Training Department and the Legislative Yuan of the National Government in the 19th year of the Republic of China to promulgate a special trade union law, or the postal workers' union to hold an organizational law for compliance. On May 5th, the 20th year of the Republic of China, when the National Assembly was held, the Association, together with postal workers' unions in various places, united with representatives from various industrial circles to formally draft a proposal and submit it to the meeting. The Assembly decided that the case of promulgating the Special Trade Union Law should be submitted to the National Government for reference. At the First Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Committee, the Association sent representatives from trade unions along the Beijing-Shanghai Line to Beijing to petition and present detailed opinions to Zhongwei Ju Zheng, Wang Jingwei, Ye Chucang, Ma Chaojun, Zhang Zhiben, Chen Gongbo, Wang Qi, Fang Juehui, Wang Luyi, and other gentlemen, all of whom accepted them sincerely. After the reorganization of the People's Movement Association, Chen Gongbo, Chairman of the People's Movement Association, was in charge. With the summons of Chen, Director Chen Gongbo, and Wang, Deputy Director Wang Luyi, the two members Chen and Wang expressed the necessity of a general organization of trade unions, and said that the principle of organizing mass organizations was once mentioned by this person and passed by the First Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Committee, but the amendment of the Trade Union Law and the promulgation of the Special Trade Union Law still require time in terms of legal procedures. The People's Movement Association intends to formulate interim regulations within the possible scope to remedy them, etc. At the same time, the People's Movement Association instructed the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union (Original Order No. 229), etc., roughly stating, 'For information, after reviewing the documents, it was approved that the Central Secretariat sent a document to the association, etc., as a document requesting the rapid promulgation of the Special Trade Union Law and requesting that members be allowed to attend the meeting when drafting the law, with a draft of the Special Trade Union Law attached. According to this, the association is drafting the Special Trade Union Law in accordance with the recent decision of the Central Government to guide the mass movement plan. As for the request to allow members to attend the meeting when drafting the law, this association may send a letter of appointment when necessary. The draft of the Special Trade Union Law shall be retained for reference. In addition to distribution, please inform, etc.' It is clear that the Central Government attaches great importance to the postal workers' union. Until October of the 21st year of the Republic of China, the Executive Yuan promulgated the Organizational Rules of the Postal Workers' Union, but it has not been implemented because of some obstacles. It is too much to say that the establishment of the postal workers' union is not based on law. In short, the current organization of the postal workers' union is a sound group that can be driven by the party and the country. The facts show that it cannot be erased. At the beginning of the implementation of the constitution, this good social organization and this group that is beneficial to the party and the country should be supported by law to show the state's intention to maintain the people's movement. For the sake of society and the party and the country, we should promptly promulgate the Organizational Law of the Postal Workers' Union and approve the existing organization of the postal workers' union in accordance with the law to adapt to the needs of the facts and conform to the legislative purpose of the state. This is to continue the previous requests to promptly promulgate the Organizational Law of the Postal Workers' Union. It has been found that the postal workers' union is not included in the representatives of the National Assembly. The Association has previously consulted with the railway and maritime unions to submit petitions to the Central Party Headquarters, the Legislative Yuan of the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of the Interior, etc., requesting additional amendments, all of which have been approved for remediation in the implementing rules of the election law. It has now been found that the implementing rules of the election law have been promulgated. Although the railway and maritime unions have been included, the representatives of the postal workers' union are not specified, which is deeply alarming. If it is not to discriminate against the status of the postal workers' union, it is feared that it does not conform to the purpose of promoting the constitution. If it is said that the postal workers' union does not have a legal basis today and cannot be included as an example of representatives of the National Assembly, then the Association and the postal workers' unions in various places have been guided and trained by the party for many years, and have not been regarded as illegal organizations, but have been praised as models of trade unions. The existence of the postal workers' union today cannot be denied in fact. This is the first reason why the postal workers' union should not be excluded from the representatives of the National Assembly. It has been found that special trade unions were first created by the Prime Minister, and they have a large number of people and sound organizations. They have struggled for the revolution for many years and have contributed a lot to the party. The postal workers' union is one of the special trade unions, and its importance is no less than that of the railway and maritime unions. Moreover, from the standpoint of the party, it has a long history. Now that the railway and maritime unions have been included in the representatives of the National Assembly, and the postal workers' union has been excluded alone, who would say that this is fair? This is the second reason why the postal workers' union should be excluded from the representatives of the National Assembly. The party's ideology aims to achieve popular sovereignty, democracy, and people's ownership. On the eve of the implementation of the constitution, we are afraid that we will not be able to support and maintain the mass organizations and workers' movements. However, the postal workers' union has not received any support or maintenance from the beginning. It relies on self-reliance and takes the party's labor policy as its guide. The impact on the workers' movement in China is not insignificant. Furthermore, the postal workers' union has participated in the mass movements in various places, so the postal workers' union has not only become the center of the national labor movement, but also laid the foundation for the party's people's movement. Now that the trade unions of various industries and various mass organizations have been included in the representatives of the National Assembly, the postal workers' union, which has achieved remarkable results in the labor and people's movements, is not included, which is truly perplexing. This is the third reason why the postal workers' union should not be excluded from the representatives of the National Assembly. The above points are all based on facts. Therefore, we have listed the situation below. We implore you to promulgate and implement the organizational laws and regulations of the postal workers' union, and approve the existing organization of the postal workers' union in accordance with the law, and include the postal workers' union in the representatives of the National Assembly, and add the number of representatives to maintain postal operations and emphasize the constitution. We are eagerly awaiting orders." We hope that you will uphold justice and unanimously advocate for the achievement of our goals. Thank you. The National Postal Workers' Union of the Republic of China, July 10, 25th year of the Republic.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Hongxing Sock Factory: Refusal to Register Workers; Labor Union Requests Assistance from Du Yuesheng <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The Hongxing Sock Factory on Caishi Road in the French Concession, due to the registration of workers and the indefinite work stoppage, caused panic among all the workers about their livelihoods. They petitioned the party and government agencies for relief. The Social Affairs Bureau summoned both parties to the bureau for questioning on Monday. It was decided that the factory should not dismiss workers, and the workers should all comply with the party and government-approved registration regulations to register with the factory. The factory was ordered to resume normal operations on the 20th of this month. However, yesterday morning, eight members of the factory's labor union went to the factory to register but were rejected. The workers believed that the factory was deliberately dismissing them, and they were indignant. In addition to sending representatives to petition the party and government agencies, demanding that justice be upheld, they also appointed Zhang Zhuyun, Shi Xiuyun, Deng Yixin, and others to go to Du Yuesheng's residence with a written request yesterday afternoon, asking Mr. Du Yuesheng to provide assistance, and also requested Mr. Lu Jingshi, a member of the Municipal Party Department, to make a similar expression in order to maintain the livelihoods of hundreds of workers.</p>

<p>Li Xianjian and Lei Lin, both from Guangdong, have been engaged in business in the United States. Recently, they returned to China on the Empress of Canada, arriving at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Shanghai at 11 PM the night before. Because the ship had to stay in Shanghai for a day, Li and Lei went ashore to explore. At that time, Xie Daozhen, Shi Hong, and Liang Ji, all from Guangdong, stepped forward and offered to be their guides. Li and others were worried about being unfamiliar with the area, so they immediately hired them as guides. Xie then helped Li and Lei check into rooms 334 and 330 at the New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road for a temporary stay. Xie then encouraged Li and Lei to engage with prostitutes and solicited two prostitutes for them. Xie told Li and others that the prostitutes in Shanghai were of very low character and that it was dangerous for them to carry money. He claimed that he was an employee of the New Asia and could send all their money to the cashier's office for safekeeping. Li and Lei believed him. Li handed over all his US dollars, totaling 400, and eight checks, totaling 1700. Lei also handed over 240 US dollars to Xie, who issued two receipts before leaving. Yesterday morning at 4 AM, when Li and others wanted to retrieve the money, they went to the cashier's office at the New Asia to retrieve it. The cashier's office replied that they had not received the money. Li and Lei realized they had been scammed and told the whole story. The New Asia reported to the Hongkou Police Station. Under the investigation of Chinese Detective Chen Xikang, Xie Dehua, a room attendant from room 198 of the New Asia, stated that he had seen Xie Daozhen go to room 411. The detectives went to that room and found Xie, Shi, and Liang inside. All three were arrested. In the room, they also found Lu Guinian, Zhao Min, Li Xing, Cai Shan, and four other Cantonese. All the original stolen goods were found under the pillow. Three banknotes from the Zhobian Bank, which had been closed for more than ten years, were found on the ground, totaling twenty yuan. All were taken back to the police station. At 9 AM, they were escorted to the Fifth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu prosecuted them for defrauding under Article 339 of the Criminal Law, stating that this kind of incident was currently occurring, and the defendant Shi Hong had been sent to the court by the police station for a similar incident, but he was released due to insufficient evidence because the victim did not stay long and returned to Guangdong. Due to the urgency of the time, a detailed investigation had not yet been conducted, so they requested an adjournment for further questioning. Judge Ye Shengchao briefly questioned Li, Lei, and the defendants, then announced an adjournment. The recovered stolen goods were returned to the plaintiff.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Rapid Floodwater Recession Relieves Yangtze River Concerns: Hankou Retreats to Below Thirty Feet; Water Levels in Jiujiang and Wuhu Fall Consistently <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Since the Yangtze River flooded, the downstream areas, such as Hankou, reached a high of 35 feet 5 inches, only 3 feet 3 inches lower than the high water level during the major flood of 1931. Therefore, the situation was very serious. Fortunately, the water levels have since receded. Although fluctuations have been observed recently, none have exceeded 35 feet. As of the 12th of this month, according to the Hankou water level report received by the customs, it has receded to below 30 feet, measured at 29 feet. The water level in Jiujiang on the same day also receded to 32 feet (36 feet 4 inches on the 1st of this month). The water level in Wuhu on the same day also receded to 20 feet 9 inches (23 feet on the 1st of this month). Observing the above water levels, they are consistently falling, and the retreat is very rapid. From now on, the Yangtze River basin may be able to celebrate peace.</p>
<h3 id="e127">National Products Exhibition Scheduled to Open <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The North Shanghai National Products Exhibition will open on the 17th, the Special District National Products Exhibition will open on the 20th, and the West Shanghai National Products Exhibition is scheduled to hold a lantern parade on the 26th. The details are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>North Shanghai</p>
<p>The North Shanghai National Products Exhibition was delayed due to the incomplete amusement park construction, so only the business was opened on the 11th. Now that the construction is complete, the association has specially invited famous figures in drama, storytelling, and opera to open at 2 PM on the 17th, following the opening ceremony. Shan Wangxiaolai will unveil the curtain, and Wang Manyun will raise the flag. At the same time, people from all walks of life in the city will be invited, and gifts will be given to the guests.</p>
<p>West Shanghai</p>
<p>The Shanghai West Shanghai National Products Exhibition has been very popular since its opening, with many visitors from all walks of life. More than 60 factories are participating in the exhibition, which is divided into two sections: display and temporary market. The display section has been arranged and officially opened. The goods sold in the temporary market are all exquisite national products and daily necessities for the summer. Because the association first promotes national products and encourages people to try them, the prices are particularly low and suitable for the common people in the factory area of West Shanghai. However, in order to maintain costs, each factory has regulations and restrictions on the purchase of goods by guests. All the facilities of the association are meticulous and thoughtful. All the on-site staff are dispatched at any time, and they answer questions from guests sincerely. The factory staff can also follow the rules and treat people with courtesy. Therefore, although the large venue is bustling and noisy, the order is well-maintained. According to the association's statistics, about 14,200 visitors have attended in the five days since the opening, and the business in the market has reached more than 9,800 yuan. The exact figures will be published after detailed statistics in a week. In addition, the association plans to hold a lantern parade, which is actively being prepared and is scheduled to be held on the 26th.</p>
<p>Special District</p>
<p>The Special District National Products Exhibition is scheduled to open on the 20th. Yesterday, a meeting of factory representatives was held, attended by more than 40 people. Jiang Shangen chaired the meeting. The following resolutions were made: (1) The association should appoint famous figures in the national products industry to form a committee to expand the association. It was resolved to appoint Wang Xiaoxiang, Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Zhu Gengtao, Zhou Bangjun, Xu Xiaochu, Le Zhoucheng, Qian Zongjian, Xu Genghua, Jiang Shangen, Xu Yunhui, Wang Hanqiang, Lin Guyun, Shen Liucun, and Xu Jianruo as members. (2) The association should appoint publicity committee members to expand publicity efforts. It was resolved to appoint Tao Leqin, Zhu Yutao, Ge Futian, Zheng Dongshan, Wang Zhaobi, Sun Baohui, Zhu Bin, Li Peiying, Cheng Gengnong, Yan Yongqing, and others as publicity committee members. A letter was also sent to various factories: "Dear Sirs, at a time when international tensions are increasing, the whole country is striving for self-reliance as a way to solve problems, and the national products movement is the basic work of self-reliance. If we can work together with one heart and mind and actively carry out this movement, the revival of the national economy and the revitalization of national industry can be expected soon. In view of this, our association has surveyed and determined that the former site of the Zhonghua Xingye Company at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Shili Road (more than a dozen city houses, including all the rooms on the second floor) will hold the "Shanghai Special District National Products Exhibition," dividing the venue into 80 rooms and soliciting participation from national products manufacturers. The exhibition will last for one month and is scheduled to open on the 20th of this month. The location is central and the transportation is convenient, making it the most prosperous area in the city. With a grand scale and effective publicity, the business prospects can be assured. We have always admired your factory's excellent products, which bring glory to national products. Therefore, we are sending this letter to solicit your participation to promote publicity and support the grand event. There are not many venues, so please register as soon as possible to avoid being left out when the quota is full."</p>
<h3 id="e128">Statistics on Registered Opium Smokers Within One Week: A Total of 938 Male and Female Smokers <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Since the city's registration of opium smokers began, the Municipal Public Security Bureau has dispatched inspectors and police officers to actively investigate and suppress unregistered opium smokers in the Chinese area. However, in the Pitu Special District, there are often unlicensed opium smokers entering the area to smoke opium. In order to universally register and complete the reporting work within the time limit, the bureau has dispatched a large number of inspectors and police chiefs to strictly investigate day and night. According to the bureau's statistics, from July 1st to the 10th, 938 opium smokers were registered within one week. Those who were sent to the hospital for detoxification due to lack of funds are not included. The bureau is still actively investigating, hoping to ensure that no unregistered opium smokers are missed when the deadline expires.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Tragic Incident of Filicide Occurs in Longhua Town: Shi Aming Appears to Have Mental Illness; After Killing His Son, He Wrapped the Head Carefully; Grieving Grandfather Reported to Police to Arrest Son <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>At about 3 AM the day before yesterday, Liu Songjian, a patrolman at the Longhua Town Branch of West Shanghai, received a report from Shi Asanshi, a native of Haimen. The report stated that he lived in a thatched shed in Pan's Residence, south of Zhahe Temple, making a living by farming. He had two sons, the elder Aming, 38 years old, and the younger Jianming, 34 years old. Aming married a woman named He, and they also had two sons, the elder named Dagou, 12 years old, and the younger named Heimao, just four years old. Aming worked as a worker at the Longzhang Paper Mill in Rihui Bridge outside, leaving early and returning late as usual. However, since last year, he seemed to have symptoms of mental illness, and he hated his younger son Heimao to the bone. Yesterday morning at about 3 AM, Aming took Heimao out in his arms. The father knew something was wrong and immediately followed him. When he reached the Wai Yangqi area behind the Lu's Garden, he suddenly saw that Heimao had been killed, his headless body exposed on the ground, a bloody mess, too horrible to bear. Therefore, he came to report and requested the arrest, etc. Patrolman Liu immediately dispatched Sergeant Tang Chunrong and police officers Wei Duoyi and Zhao Bohang to pursue him. They arrested the murderer Shi Aming at Jijiawan and found a package in his abdomen. Upon inspection, it was a bloody head. Shi Asanshi identified it as the head of his murdered grandson Heimao. They immediately took him back to the station. When questioned, the murderer remained silent, only saying "no way." The patrolman believed that the case involved a human life and ordered the head of the Bao, Wu Quansheng, to report to the District Court for an autopsy. The plaintiff, Shi Asanshi, and the murderer, Shi Aming, father and son, were sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Zhao Genfa, a Rickshaw Owner, Accuses Yin Zhiling of Embezzlement and Fraud; Court Finds Facts Clear, Acquits Yin <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Yin Zhiling, a member of the Rickshaw Guild, was recently accused by Zhao Genfa, a rickshaw owner from Yancheng, Jiangbei, of embezzlement and fraud, violating Articles 336, Section 2, and 342 of the Criminal Law. In addition to requesting punishment according to the law, he also filed a civil suit. The indictment stated that the plaintiff had ten rickshaws, and all monthly donations, licenses, and custody procedures were entrusted to his cousin Zhao Guanbao. Zhao Guanbao entrusted Yin Zhiling, a member of the Rickshaw Guild, to donate the licenses. There had been no objection for several years. In April of this year, the plaintiff returned to his hometown to manage his farmland and suddenly received a special messenger from Zhao Guanbao to Yancheng, stating that Yin Zhiling had deliberately made things difficult and refused to hand over the rickshaw licenses, so the rickshaws had been suspended for two months. The plaintiff heard this and immediately rushed to Shanghai, asking Chen Zhenzhu to reason with the defendant. However, the defendant claimed that Zhao Guanbao had not cleared his procedures with him and that he had to wait for Zhao to clear them before discussing it. Whether Zhao Guanbao's procedures with the defendant were true or not, it was Zhao Guanbao's personal matter. How could the plaintiff's car licenses be suspended for no reason, resulting in two months of business suspension and huge losses? This clearly violated the criminal law and included a civil suit, requesting a judgment ordering compensation for the two months of lost business, etc. This case was heard by Judge Huang Risheng in the Eighth Criminal Court yesterday morning at 11 AM. The plaintiff, Zhao Genfa, and witness Zhao Guanbao testified about the previous situation. The defendant, Yin Zhiling, also came to court with his defense lawyer Jiang Baoli, stating that Zhao Guanbao had mortgaged his ten rickshaws to Yin for 400 yuan in national currency in August of last year and had written an IOU. This time, because Zhao Guanbao did not hand over the license fees, he could not donate the licenses. However, he did not know that the ownership of the ten rickshaws belonged to the plaintiff beforehand. He submitted the IOU to the court. Witness Bu Zhengang also testified that the loan of 400 yuan was indeed the case, and he and Zhao Guanbao signed it, but he did not know about the mortgage. The court, finding the facts clear, ordered the start of the debate and acquitted Yin Zhiling in court. The plaintiff's civil suit was dismissed.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Trucking Industry Association stated that since the January 28th Incident, the prices of gasoline, tires, parts, etc., have soared, and taxes have also become heavy. Not only is business difficult, but the industry is declining, with bankruptcies and liquidations occurring one after another. In order to maintain capital and seek survival, the association held several meetings and decided to increase freight rates by 20% across the board from the 15th of this month. The association has informed its members beforehand to comply with the decision to compensate for the losses and informed users yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Zhang Yanzhang's Appeal Rejected; Shen Jinzhou Found Not Guilty <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>After the Liujiang Coal Mine Company was forcibly seized, the company's manager, Shen Jinzhou, reported the situation to the Shanghai Coal Industry Association. The association convened a meeting of all coal businesses in Shanghai and resolved to refuse to sell Liujiang coal to show resistance. Unexpectedly, Youxin Coal Shop, led by Zhang Yanzhang, disregarded the association's notice and privately sold Liujiang coal. Shen Jinzhou reported this to the association, pointing out that he was privately selling stolen coal, and he was expelled from the association and notified to all colleagues. Zhang Yanzhang believed that Shen's actions harmed his reputation and hired a lawyer to file a complaint against Shen with the First Special Court. The first instance found Shen Jinzhou not guilty. Zhang Yanzhang disagreed with the first instance judgment and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court. The appellee, Shen Jinzhou, still hired lawyer Xu Tuhao to defend him in court. Judge Yu concluded the interrogation. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yu Hua and Judges Zhou and Zhong took their seats and announced the judgment, rejecting the appeal. The judgment has been delivered to both parties. Due to the length of the words, it is omitted.</p>

<p>Xia Lanjin, a woman from Shaoxing, is in her early twenties and quite beautiful. Because life in the countryside was difficult, she came to Shanghai last winter and worked as a female worker at the Toyota Yarn Factory on Zhongshan Road in West Shanghai. She lived in the house of Guo Jinsheng on the same road in Fanwangdu. At about 6 PM yesterday evening, Xia returned home from work and was taking a bath when Xi Zhifu (24 years old), a carpenter from Changzhou who lived in the same house, broke into the room without asking questions and dragged Xia onto the bed, intending to rape her. Xia was unable to resist and had to call for help loudly. The landlord, Guo Jinsheng, heard the sound and came to help Xia Lanjin capture Xi Zhifu on the spot. Xia put on her clothes and went to the Zhongshan Road Police Station, which transferred her to the Caojiadu Public Security Bureau for questioning. Xi's confession was evasive. The bureau believed that the case involved the rape of a young woman and prepared a document to send her to the headquarters for further investigation.</p>

<p>Zhuangjiage, Jiangwan Road, Zhabei, is the home of the late tailor Yao Tongsheng, who had considerable property and was from a well-to-do family. He passed away five years ago. More than ten years ago, he became acquainted with a woman named Chen Yuezhen (40 years old this year), and they lived together. Yuezhen was strong-willed and kicked out Yao's wife, taking her place like a magpie occupying a dove's nest. She has since given birth to a son and a daughter, both in their teens. Yao loved them very much and entrusted everything to her. When Yao died, all his property was in Yuezhen's hands, while Yao's mother, Mrs. Shen, who is 73 years old, had to beg for food from Yuezhen. Yuezhen, who had been alone and lonely since Yao's death, took advantage of her wealth and seduced her nephew Jiang Ruiyun into adultery. Soon after, she gave birth to another son, and the scandal spread far and wide. Mrs. Yao Shen hired her clansman Yao Changgui to persuade Yuezhen and Yang to restrain their behavior, but they were reported to the security team, who arrested Yao Changgui and sent him to the North Station Branch Bureau. The General Bureau transferred him to the court for release. Thereupon, great public outrage arose in the clan. Mrs. Yao Shen hired lawyer Yao Fuling to report to the North Station Branch Bureau, who arrested Chen Yuezhen and sent her to the Public Security Bureau. Yesterday, she was sent to the District Court and was ordered by Prosecutor Lei to be detained for further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Xu Wenliang, Who Was Kidnapped the Day Before Yesterday, Is Indeed Not Well-Off; Failed in Speculative Business Ventures; Shows Signs of Being Outwardly Strong but Inwardly Weak <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Xu Wenliang, a Cantonese residing at 1305 Yuyuan Road, was suddenly robbed and then kidnapped by bandits the day before yesterday, which is a novel approach to kidnapping cases. It is reported that Mr. Xu is a small-scale manager in the gasoline department of Mobil Oil Company. In recent years, he has repeatedly failed in speculative businesses such as government bonds and bidding, incurring heavy losses, and he has shown signs of being outwardly strong but inwardly weak. The report yesterday that Mr. Xu had won the first prize in the Golden Goblet Charitable Champagne was not true. The first prize was won jointly by Mr. Xu and Jishentang, Tang, Huang, and four others. This matter was recorded in the newspapers at the time. It is believed that the unfortunate incident was because the bandits were not satisfied with what they had gained and took the opportunity to kidnap Mr. Xu.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Robbery at the Lixiao Public Hall <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The Lixiao Sanyitang Public Hall, recently founded by Cao Yimin at No. 9 Deshunli, Baxianqiao, Avenue Edward VII, held a ceremony to consecrate the Buddha statues the day before yesterday and hosted a banquet to welcome friends from the Lixiao sect. Some members of the church voluntarily donated funds, which aroused the covetousness of robbers. At 2:40 PM that afternoon, just as the banquet was over and the bill was being settled, three robbers suddenly rushed into the living room and punched the bookkeeper Song Guifang on the right cheek, causing him to faint. The robbers immediately searched. At that time, the staff of the hall mistakenly thought that local hooligans had come to extort money. When they saw people being beaten and money being robbed, they realized that robbers had come to their door, but they did not dare to resist. The robbers took the money and fled out the door. Neighbors witnessed this and shouted for help. A French police detective happened to be patrolling and captured a robber. After inquiring about the loss of more than 200 yuan, he took the robber back to the police station. Yesterday, he was sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation and detention to investigate and arrest the fleeing accomplices and then prosecute them for punishment.</p>

<p>Cai Wang-shi, an old woman from Wuxi, was 65 years old and lived at 29 Tiande Lane, Wuhua Road, Zhabei. She had a son, Cai Geng-quan, 29 years old, who married Feng Cui-ling, 18 years old. The daughter-in-law did not uphold marital virtues, as she would go on late night strolls with her boyfriend. Cai Geng-quan caught a glimpse of this and reprimanded her. Feng Cui-ling, in a fit of pique, went back to her mother, Feng Cai-shi (from Guangdong, 51 years old, living at 58 Xintai'an Lane, Tiantong Road), to complain. Feng Cai-shi flew into a rage and led over a dozen men and women, including Feng-shi and Cai Gen-bao, to the Cai's residence at about 11:30 PM, acting as an army to demand justice. They beat Cai Wang-shi, who suffered serious injuries and fell to the ground. The police on patrol saw this, arrested Feng Cai-shi and the other men and women, and rushed the injured Cai Wang-shi to Guangren Hospital for treatment. However, the treatment was ineffective, and she died at about 2:00 AM yesterday. The police interrogated the suspects and instructed the local head to petition the District Court to send a prosecutor to the scene to verify that the deceased had indeed died from injuries. They instructed the family to prepare the body for burial in a coffin. The four defendants, Feng Cai-shi and the other men and women, were sent to the police station for interrogation.</p>

<h3 id="e138">The North and South Gangs of Laborers in the Fish Market Engaged in a Brawl: The Water Patrol Team Sent Police Officers to Suppress It and Restore Order, Arresting 13 Leaders from Both Sides <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The small laborers on the fishing boats in the local fish market originally belonged to the North and South Gangs, each occupying the east and west sides of the market pier, respectively. They earned their living by untying mooring lines for the ships, and each shipowner would pay them wages. Recently, the North Gang laborers had fewer ships and their income decreased sharply, so they competed to occupy the South Gang pier. Therefore, the South Gang laborers, for their own interests, gathered dozens of people, each carrying weapons such as wooden sticks, and waited at the pier around 3:00 PM yesterday, looking for trouble. The North Gang was unwilling to show weakness and also gathered comrades, resulting in a brawl, which almost caused a major disaster. Fortunately, Wang Da-guan, the patrol officer of the First Water Patrol Division, learned of the situation and immediately led police officers to suppress it. They arrested the leaders of the plaintiffs, Wang Fu (43 years old, from Nantong), Zhou Shi-bao (33 years old, from Nantong), Zhu Jiu-bao (25 years old, from Nantong), Sun Ji-fu (26 years old, from Shandong), Gu Wen-rong (23 years old, from Nantong), Jin Bao-sheng (47 years old, from Gaoyou), Yuan Jin-hu (23 years old, from Yancheng), and the leaders of the defendants, Zhang Zhao-xi (36 years old, from Shandong), Sun Mei-xiang (27 years old, from Shandong), Xu Cheng-qin (35 years old, from Shandong), Ma Shi-de (46 years old, from Shandong), Ren Xing-fu (29 years old, from Shandong), and Tian Zhi-chuan (24 years old, from Shandong). Zhang Zhao-xi was wounded in the head and face, and his face was a bloody mess, which was a terrible sight. Ten wooden sticks were confiscated on the spot. The thirteen plaintiffs and defendants were quickly taken to the headquarters for interrogation.</p>

<p>The Putuo Pilgrimage organized by the Shipping Club has seen an enthusiastic increase in participants of both sexes recently, with over fifty people already. Yesterday, the group leader Yu Qia-qing and deputy leader Mao He-yuan, among others, discussed the arrangements and itinerary in the club's meeting room.

<h3 id="e140">Firewood Businesses Need Certification from the Guild to Obtain Licenses: The Ministry of Industry Responds to the Chamber of Commerce <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from the Local Miscellaneous Firewood Industry Guild stating that unscrupulous individuals in the city take advantage of the low cost and easy procedures to set up fake businesses. When they see a firewood boat, they do not let it join the guild. Instead, they charge a dry commission of several cents to several yuan, depending on the size of the boat, and allow the firewood merchant to sell freely. Often, after selling 70-80% of the firewood, they rush back to their hometown and sell the remaining 20-30% at a low price to get rid of it. One boat disregards the market situation and dumps the firewood, affecting the price for the boats that arrive later. This situation not only harms the business of guild members but also disrupts the firewood market. The root cause is the people who collect dry commissions. If this is not stopped, the livelihood of the guild members will be in jeopardy. The guild requested that the Ministry of Industry order the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau to strictly ban this practice. In the future, new businesses should be thoroughly reviewed by the guild to ensure they have capital, a business front, and are officially operating. If they are legitimate, the guild will guarantee to the Finance Bureau that they are eligible to receive a business license and open for business. The guild submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry on the [blank] day of last month to allow this to be implemented. Yesterday, they received a notification from the Ministry of Industry, Commerce Division, No. 45527, stating that the Chamber of Commerce's previous request from the Miscellaneous Firewood Industry Guild to allow the guild to apply for business licenses on behalf of its members should be handled by the relevant authorities. When merchants apply for licenses, they should be ordered to provide proof of their situation from the guild. The decision to approve or reject the application should be based on the proof. A document has been sent to the Shanghai Municipal Government for review and response. Now that the response has been received, the Finance Bureau has been instructed to comply. This notification is hereby given.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Telegraph Bureau previously stipulated that programs such as Siming Nanci, Siming Wenshu, Shanghai Opera, Suzhou Tanci, Small Songs, Qing Songs, Huai Opera, and various school plays, which are related to social interaction, must not exceed two hours of broadcast time. Subsequently, the Siming Nanci broadcaster Sheng Yong-qing and others sent a letter to the Ningbo Association in Shanghai, requesting them to forward it to the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau to request the removal of the restrictions. After deliberation, the bureau decided to generally extend the broadcast time for the above ten programs by one hour. Yesterday, they also replied to the Ningbo Association, stating that in response to the association's letter dated July 11, which forwarded the request from seventeen Siming Nanci broadcasters, including Sheng Yong-qing, to remove the restrictions on Siming Nanci broadcast time, the bureau had previously restricted the broadcast time of ten programs, including Shanghai Opera, because many of the lyrics were related to social education and had been repeatedly requested to be stopped by listeners. Now, the broadcast time for these programs has been extended by one hour to a maximum of three hours per day. Furthermore, they are not allowed to be scheduled between 7:00 PM and 10:00 PM. The previous restrictions have been relaxed. This response is hereby sent to the Ningbo Association for their information. Sincerely, Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, Ministry of Transportation.</p>

<h3 id="e143">The Trial of Zhou Baixing for Beating His Grandfather to Death Concludes: Zhou Meixin Gives Irrelevant Answers, the Defendant's Wife Testifies to What She Knows <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Shaoqing, a 63-year-old villager from Zhoujiazhai, Xisanli, Sanlintang, Pudong, had a son, but both the son and daughter-in-law died, each leaving behind a grandson: Zhou Baixing, 19 years old, and Zhou Xuexing. Both grandsons were dissolute and gambled away their money. On April 12 of the lunar calendar, they demanded money from their grandfather Shaoqing, who was frugal and unwilling to support their extravagance. As a result, the two grandsons beat him violently, causing his immediate death. Zhou Baixing fled to his father-in-law, Zhou Xuegen's, house at 139 Luxuezhai, Caojiadu, Shanghai West. Baixing's wife, Zhou Zhou-shi, questioned him about the situation and reported him to the police, who arrested her husband Zhou Baixing and detained him in the District Court. Zhou Xuexing fled and is still at large. After careful investigation, Prosecutor Lei determined that Zhou Baixing should be severely punished in accordance with Article 277, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law for injury resulting in death, and Article 280, Paragraph 1 for injury to a senior relative. Yesterday, Judge Chen Kang-sun presided over the trial. First, the daughter of the deceased, Zhou Meixin (an uneducated simpleton), was interrogated. She stated that she was 21 years old, a local resident, and lived in Zhoujiazhai. Question: Who was Zhou Shaoqing to you, and how did he die? Answer: He was my father. I don't know how he died. I only know that I heard noises in the middle of the night. I got up and saw four people running away, two to the east and two to the south. Question: What did the four people look like? Answer: I didn't see clearly. I only saw my father fall down. Question: What do you call Zhou Baixing? Answer: I call him aunt. But Baixing had been out for three days already. He wasn't home the night before my father died. Question: Why did Baixing usually argue with your father? Answer: They didn't argue. When asked repeatedly about the four murderers who ran east and west, she gave irrelevant answers. Then, Zhou Zhou-shi, 20 years old, from Zhoujiazhai, testified that she lived with her mother in Caojiadu and that her husband was Zhou Baixing. She had a child with him. Because her husband was not engaged in honest work, she lived with her mother. On the morning of April 13, around 7:00 AM, he came. At that time, I was working the night shift, so I was asleep. Question: What did he say? Answer: He didn't say anything. Question: Was he in a state of panic? Answer: He said he came from the countryside. When asked further, he didn't say a word. Question: You testified to the prosecutor that your great-grandfather was beaten badly? Answer: The villagers came to report it. Then, Zhou Baixing testified that Zhou Xuexing beat his grandfather to death. That night, I went to bed early. When I woke up, I heard my grandfather calling for help. I got up and rushed out, but Zhou Xuexing grabbed me and we went out together. Zhou Xuexing and I went east, and three others went west. We took a boat at Zhoujiadu. Question: Why didn't you report it to the police? Answer: I didn't see any patrol officers, and then I didn't see them anymore. Then, Prosecutor Lei gave his opinion, stating that after Zhou Baixing and Zhou Xuexing beat their grandfather to death, they fled to the home of Zhou Baixing's father-in-law in Shanghai. His wife saw that he was in a panic and asked him what happened. He said that his grandfather had been beaten to death. When she asked him again, he didn't say anything. But according to Zhou Meixin's testimony, there were four people. Zhou Baixing's testimony at the Caojiadu police station was the same. But Zhou Baixing saw his grandfather being beaten to death. Shouldn't he have been heartbroken and reported it to the authorities? How could he have run to Shanghai instead? When he arrived at his father-in-law's house, he claimed that his grandfather was acting improperly outside and was beaten to death when he returned. Zhou Meixin testified that someone knocked on the door and called him out. This shows that Zhou Baixing was trying to fabricate a story. Such an unfilial and wicked person should be severely punished. The court appointed the lawyer Sun Ba-wu to defend the defendant. After hearing the legal arguments, the judge adjourned the debate and announced that the verdict would be delivered on the 21st. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Kidnapping Bandit Zhang Afu Appeals to the Supreme Court for the Second Time: Now Returned to the High Court Third Branch for Retrial <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Qian Zhao-fu, a local manager of Yongfeng Timber Company in Nanshi, and Pu Wen-ting, a Wuxi manager of Fuxin Flour Mill, were kidnapped by bandits in the French Concession in the 20s of the Republic, and huge ransoms were demanded. On August 16 of the following year, special agents of the French Concession police solved the case, arresting five bandits including Zheng Shifan, Zhang Afu and Zhang Jiancheng, all locals, and seized firearms and other items. They were sent to the Special Second Court for prosecution. After interrogation, Zheng Shifan and Zhang Afu were each sentenced to life imprisonment, and Zhang Jiancheng was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment. Because he was also involved in another kidnapping case, he was sentenced to death by the Special First Court and executed. Zheng Shifan and Zhang Afu, dissatisfied with the verdict, appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court, which later commuted Zheng Shifan's sentence to 12 years imprisonment, and rejected Zhang Afu's appeal. The two criminals were still dissatisfied and appealed to the Supreme Court, which overturned the original verdict and returned the case to the Third Branch of the High Court for retrial. As a result, the Third Branch of the High Court reduced Zheng Shifan's sentence to nine years imprisonment, and still rejected Zhang Afu's appeal. Zheng was still not convinced and filed another appeal to the Supreme Court for retrial. The Supreme Court reviewed the entire case file and found that whether Pu Wen-ting's family had received a ransom negotiation call was unclear, so it overturned the original verdict again and returned the case to the Third Branch of the High Court for retrial. After receiving the case file, the Third Branch of the High Court summoned Zheng Shifan for investigation and interrogation at the First Criminal Court yesterday morning, presided over by Judge Liao. The witnesses Pu Wen-ting and his wife, Pu Huang-shi (represented by Zhu Yu-ting, an employee of Fuxin Mill), and Qin You-yu, an investigator from the French Concession police, were also summoned to court for questioning. Lawyer Fei Xi-zhen from the French Concession Police Department and Zheng's defense lawyer were also present in court. The court questioned the defendant Zheng and the witnesses one by one for over an hour. Zheng continued to deny his involvement in the kidnapping case. The court ordered that the case be further investigated and a date be set for trial. Zheng was returned to custody.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Public Buses in the City Center Should Have Bus Stops: Dong Yu-xiao Submitted a Petition to the Municipal Government Yesterday <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Huang Yu-zhai, manager of Huizhong Bank on Ningbo Road, submitted a petition to the Municipal Government yesterday, stating, (excerpt): Since the opening of Greater Shanghai, the number of residents in the city center has increased daily, and the population has gradually become prosperous. The China Merchants Public Bus directly reaches the Municipal Government, which is convenient for pedestrians. However, the company's equipment for passengers may be inadequate, especially the bus stop item. The company does not pay attention to this, only planting a parking sign on the side of the road, and not considering the passengers in any other way. The time interval between vehicles is as long as forty minutes. Passengers waiting for the bus suffer from the scorching sun in summer, and the heat is unbearable. There is no shelter from the sun, and the feet are on a road as hot as fire. They not only suffer from the heat, but also from the difficulty of waiting for the bus. Moreover, the weather in summer is unpredictable, with thunder and rain. Once encountered, there is no shelter anywhere. Those with thin clothes on their backs are like chickens falling into the water. It is inevitable for the old to stumble and the young to fall, and they may suffer from heatstroke or illness, endangering their lives. The harm is even greater. In winter, the north wind is whistling and rain and snow are flying. The cold penetrates through heavy clothes. Standing and waiting for a long time is unbearable on the icy road. Or, snow accumulates above the ankles, making walking difficult. This is really inconvenient for passengers. Although the concessions do not have this equipment either, why should we be fussy about the Chinese areas? Because the situation in the Chinese areas is different and cannot be compared with the concessions. The concessions have prosperous markets and shops are densely packed. One can avoid the wind and sun at any time and anywhere. The city center area is not like this. There are open fields all around, and there is no way to avoid it. This situation is not only what I have witnessed, but also what I have experienced. Therefore, it is urgent to establish public wind and rain bus stops in the city center to benefit pedestrians and facilitate their transportation. Since the opening of Greater Shanghai, the construction can be said to be perfect, but the matter of bus stops has not yet been considered. Therefore, I take the liberty to petition Your Honor on behalf of the citizens of the city center to order the China Merchants Public Bus Company to establish these bus stops as soon as possible. This matter concerns road administration and benefits pedestrians. It can certainly be accomplished soon. I beg Your Honor to consider the human situation and order it to be implemented, which would be a great virtue. (Excerpt)</p>

<p>Zhang Longhai, a 41-year-old man from Pudong, living at 131 Binxi Road, Jiangwan Road, married Shen Cui'e (29 years old), a woman from Jiangwan. At around 9:00 PM last night, Zhang was enjoying the cool air in the living room after dinner. His wife Shen and sister-in-law Shen Zhifang (18 years old) were sitting beside him, chatting and laughing, creating a very happy scene. Suddenly, Yang Chunyi arrived, carrying a package of clothes, and broke into the room. Because they knew each other, they did not suspect anything. Yang opened the package and pulled out a pistol from his trousers pocket. He rushed into the living room and fired several shots in succession. Zhang Longhai was shot twice in the abdomen and died from his injuries. Zhang's wife, Shen, and sister-in-law, Zhifang, were terrified at the sight and tried to escape to the wasteland behind the house. Unexpectedly, Yang also chased after them, firing wildly. The bullets were like strings of beads. One bullet hit Shen Cui'e in the heart, and she fell to the ground and died on the spot. Zhifang was also shot once near her right breast. The bullet pierced her back, and she was gasping for breath, with blood gushing out. The murderer, seeing that his purpose had been achieved, quickly ran away. The maid heard the alarm and gathered the neighbors, and reported the incident to the Jiangwan Police Station, which sent police to the scene. But the murderer had already fled far away. The police were only able to take the items left behind by the murderer back to the station for filing. The seriously injured Shen Zhifang was quickly hired a car to Baolong Hospital for treatment. It is said that the injuries were severe and her life was in danger. The two male and female bodies have been reported to the local court for inspection by the Public Security Bureau. (The two bodies were photographed by Jingyi Photography Studio)</p>

<p>Dear Editor, We have received a letter from Mr. Zhan Wei-hui, stating that he recently read an article in the Shanghai News column of the Shen Bao about a child falling into the river at the Minhang ferry. Some of the details are inconsistent with the facts. The ferry does not allow idlers to stay and enjoy the cool air, and we have repeatedly advised and posted notices. However, recently, due to the major renovation of the pier, some residents are taking advantage of the fact that the iron gate cannot be locked and have reverted to their old habits. At about 9:00 PM on the 11th of this month, a large number of residents were lying on the ferry. The manager persuaded them to leave, but to no avail. The undersigned personally went to wake them up one by one. At this time, there was a sound of something falling into the water from the east side. It was impossible to investigate in the darkness. In the deep of night, two ruffians came, claiming that their son had drowned, saying that the undersigned had injured him by falling into the water and had assaulted him, beating him on the abdomen, back, and arms, and stealing a five-section flashlight. The above facts were witnessed by others. Now, fearing that the outside world may misunderstand the truth and be confused by the rumors, we have specially entrusted our lawyer to send a letter to your newspaper, requesting a correction. Therefore, we will send this letter on your behalf and hope that you will publish it in the corrections column to clarify the truth. To the Shen Bao, Lawyer Zai Bao-ji.</p>

<p>— Written and sent by Captain Li Huitang</p>
<p>Rangoon, Eighth Day (Continued)</p>
<p>(June 28th) The first match had 23,000 spectators, breaking the local record for attendance. Yesterday's match had even more, reportedly over 28,000. Fans also filled the treetops and rooftops outside the stadium, but these numbers were not included in the official count. The strong appeal of our team is evident. Today is Sunday. Thanks to the kindness of the overseas Chinese community, a small steamboat was chartered for a day's outing. The boat included a Burmese dance troupe and music for entertainment. Over two hundred overseas Chinese of both genders participated. Along the way, there were occasional showers and sunshine, laughter and conversation. The scenery of the rivers and mountains was captivating. Each time we reached a small port, we disembarked to tour the market, where residents, whether Burmese or Chinese, rushed to tell each other that the Chinese football team had arrived. As the sun began to set, we returned by the same route. By the time we arrived back at our residence, the city was illuminated. At 7 PM, we attended a tea party hosted by the Chinese Buddhist Research Association and a banquet hosted by the Minyou Club in succession. We have only been here for a few days, but we have been overwhelmed with invitations. Some people even wanted to entertain our team but couldn't due to our tight schedule. The warmth of the overseas Chinese community is truly touching.</p>
<p>(June 29th) The final match is scheduled for 5 PM today. We haven't eliminated our formidable opponents yet, and none of us dare to rest easy. The football authorities, recognizing the previous day's overflowing crowd and chaotic conditions, were determined not to repeat the mistake. They took early precautions, deploying an additional five hundred police officers and cavalry to maintain order inside and outside the stadium. Tickets were sold early at each gate, and the doors were closed as soon as they were sold out. It is said that three to four thousand people were unable to enter that day. The crowd inside was definitely more than a thousand larger than the second match. The opponent today is a team of All-Burma players, combining the best of the best. The Chinese were confident in our team's complete victory, while the Burmese were determined to avenge their previous defeat with this gathering of heroes. The Burmese governor issued an order to close all government offices early to allow officials to attend. The governor himself will also be present. The importance of this match is clear. At 5:05 PM, the following players were ready for battle. The score was 2-0 at halftime, and the final score was 4-0. Li Huitang scored two goals, while Yang Shuiyi and Tan Jiangbo each scored one.</p>
<p>Bao Jiaping</p>
<p>Li Tiansheng, Mai Shaohan</p>
<p>Chen Zhenhe, Liang Rongzhao, Zhang Xianyuan</p>
<p>Zheng Jimin, Tan Jiangbo, Li Huitang, Sun Jinshun, Yang Shuiyi</p>
<p>Before the match, the two teams stood respectfully at the foot of the platform. The captains introduced their teammates and shook hands with the Burmese governor before the game began. The Burmese team continued to attack using their short-passing skills. Fortunately, our defense performed brilliantly, preventing them from scoring. It was drizzling that day, and the field was wet and the ball slippery, making it difficult to control. However, the heavy ball favored shooting, giving our team a slight advantage. For the first fifteen minutes, although we launched numerous attacks, we couldn't break through. However, our tactics were effective, giving us the upper hand. The spectators expected our team to win. In the 25th minute, we were awarded a free kick 25 yards from the goal. Li Huitang fired a low shot into the net. The goalkeeper's view was blocked, so he couldn't save it. With the gate breached, our offense became even more fierce. Yang Jiangbo's header added another goal. The first half ended with a score of 2-0. Switching sides, the opposing team lacked stamina and struggled to defend. Fortunately, their goalkeeper made miraculous saves, stopping many shots. Yang Shuiyi, short in stature but full of ideas, attacked on the right, tricked the left defender, and scored with a diagonal shot, making it 3-0. At this point, the outcome of the match was decided. Although the opponents continued to struggle, our defense was solid, and they were not allowed to cross the line. In the 52nd minute, Li Huitang received a pass from Xiao Heitan, dribbled past two defenders, and scored with a left-footed shot, making it 4-0. Our team won decisively. The overseas Chinese celebrated joyfully. Some were so excited that they lifted me onto their shoulders and carried me from the field to the dressing room. This was due to their extreme happiness and their genuine love for our team, which cannot be described in words. The opposing team had evenly matched players, each with excellent skills, but their coordination was poor and they lacked shooting ability. As the saying goes, "For every foot of height, there's ten feet of magic," so there was nothing they could do. Our team's performance that day was perfect. Zhang Xianyuan contributed the most in this match since joining the team. He was overjoyed after the game. Zhang Xianyuan is a center back. I am now even more convinced of this. Jiang Bo has been playing forward in all three matches. It is a pity that his talents as a defender have not been revealed. However, our team has had too many forward injuries lately, so he was moved to the front line to provide immediate help. There was no better option. He has been instrumental in our attacks in every match, allowing me to penetrate deeper and contribute significantly. Together with my flexible copper head, we dominated the area and achieved numerous feats. Sun Jinshun, despite being overweight, has been working hard in every match lately, a stark contrast to the first half of the tour. Others like Jia Ping, Tiansheng, Rongzhao, and Zhenhe have also been praised by Chinese and foreign spectators alike. Since I joined the football world, I have always had good plans whenever I arrive in a new place. Perhaps this is due to good luck, as I have had this good fortune for over a decade. This time in Burma, I have been able to attract special attention in all three matches. As a result, the number nine shirt has become the focus of attention for spectators and opposing defenders. At my age, to have such good results is truly gratifying for fans. After the match, I saw that Burma's football level is not inferior to that of other places in Southeast Asia. As for individual teams, the Burmese police team is capable of competing with any team in East Asia. Their excellent dribbling, skillful short passing, agility, and clever positioning are all things we can learn from. It is a pity that their shooting is slow, they lack stamina, and their heading is sluggish. Otherwise, even though our team is strong, we would probably have to bow down and acknowledge their superiority. In the evening, as our team was leaving the next morning, the overseas Chinese community held a farewell banquet. Nearly three hundred prominent Chinese and Western figures gathered together. The scale of the event was unmatched by any sports banquet in China. Consul Cai presided over the event. The local police chief (also vice president of the football association) gave a speech, starting by saying, "Originally, I was going to order you to be deported long ago because you have caused a sensation in the city, disturbing the peace, and disrupting the city's traffic order since you arrived." His humorous and unexpected remarks caused laughter throughout the hall, showing how much the Burmese value our team. Then, Director Rong and Huitang gave speeches, expressing deep gratitude for the care and affection shown by people from all walks of life. Finally, each member of the team was presented with a commemorative medal, and I received a special award of a silver bowl. After three cheers, the event ended. As it was not yet late, we were invited to a dance hall to relax. The overseas Chinese invited us to drink, promising that no one would leave sober. By the time we returned to our residence, the clock struck three. We were exhausted, so we fell asleep without packing.</p>
<p>(June 30th) The eight days of our stay in Rangoon have come to an end in the blink of an eye. Looking back, we are filled with gratitude for the warm care and protection we received from the overseas Chinese community in all aspects of our matches and accommodations. Today, as we say farewell, we feel a sense of sadness. At 8:30 AM, hundreds of members of the overseas Chinese community came to see us off. They rode in many cars, led by a band. We paraded through the streets, with firecrackers exploding along the way. The roadsides were packed with people eager to catch a final glimpse of our team. The scene was even grander and more enthusiastic than when we arrived. At 9:30 AM, we boarded the ship. At 10 AM, we set sail westwards, waving goodbye as we headed towards Calcutta, India.</p>
<p>Note: During the farewell reception, we invited Burma to join the Far Eastern Games as a member and send a team to Shanghai in 1938 to participate in the competition. If this becomes a reality, the football competition at the Far Eastern Games will become even more exciting, and our country will have another strong opponent.</p>

<p>National Maritime News Agency, Berlin, July 14th. The South African Olympic team arrived here today and was warmly welcomed by officials and representatives of the Olympic Committee. The South African ambassador, who was assigned to handle the South African team's accommodation in Berlin, also arrived at the station to welcome them. After the official welcome, a representative from the German Foreign Ministry, Wittinhoff, introduced himself as "Foley" to the delegates, as he believed this would avoid difficulties for the South African representatives in pronouncing German names. South African national flags and Olympic flags were displayed at Berlin Station, creating a magnificent scene. Before the train stopped, the military band began playing the South African national anthem, "The Sound of South Africa." The team members were transferred from the station to the city hall for a welcome reception by car.</p>
<p>Havas Agency, Berlin, July 15th. The Olympic Games are scheduled to be held here from August 1st to August 16th.

<p>The Xiqing Swimming Team and the Guangdong Swimming Team held a competition at the Xiqing Swimming Pool at 8:30 PM last night. Many of Xiqing's athletes are now scattered, and their strength is much lower. The Guangdong team has been practicing diligently recently and has made a lot of progress. There were six events last night. Xiqing won two relay events, and each team won two of the remaining four events. As a result, Xiqing won 23 to 21, with Guangdong losing by two points.

<h3 id="e181">Finance: Last Day of August Futures, Margin Money Continues to Decline, Swap Still Requires Over Three Yuan, Resulting in Further Drop of Ninety Cents <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the last day of trading for the August gold futures market. Although the settlement price was only two yuan apart, the swap still required more than three yuan. The longs continued to close positions, resulting in a further drop. It was noted that at the beginning of the morning, the overseas silver market saw London silver trading flat with New York, and market sources said that after the market closed, there were Indian buyers on the board, but no sellers, so the forward silver price did not move. Exchange rates saw only minor fluctuations. London gold rose by one and a half pence. The Central Bank's posted exchange rates showed London and New York flat, and the Customs gold unit rose by two li. The standard margin money price was posted at 1129 yuan, and pre-market trading opened at 32 yuan zero. Dingkang, Hengchang, and Yong Lue sold and fell. The morning opening was slightly higher, but then it was flat and weak. However, because the swap pre-trade retreated from three and a half yuan to within three yuan, it rose slightly once. The HSBC bank's posted exchange rates showed London and New York flat, and major players slightly cut long positions, but still fell. The silver equalization tax was announced to decrease by two five. At this time, there was still much fluctuation. After the market opened, the longs continued to close positions. Because the settlement price was only 29 yuan, and the swap still required more than three yuan, it was revealed that the market lacked support, resulting in the weakest point at noon. The swap was posted by the longs at three to three and a half yuan. The half-day market situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was at 113.1 yuan eight jiao, slightly higher by one jiao compared to the previous closing. Futai, Yong Hengchang Yong sold from one yuan nine jiao to one yuan six jiao, and the swap price pre-trade decreased from three and a half yuan to within three yuan. Tongtaichang Futai Yong bought in, rising to two yuan three jiao. Yuanchang, Yong Da Decheng, Yuan Fa Yong Heng sold, and although the HSBC posted exchange rates were flat, the price still retreated to one yuan six jiao. Fuxing Yong Da Decheng still accepted, rising to two yuan. Da Decheng and Yuan Fa Yong took profits at the high. The silver equalization tax was announced to decrease by two five. At this time, the situation fluctuated. After the market opened, Fuxing Yong Dingkang Yuancheng Yong Da came in to sell, and the price retreated to zero seven jiao. Daheng once rose to one yuan two jiao, but because the settlement price was less than two yuan apart, but the swap still required three yuan three jiao, the longs closed positions. Jiuda floated long and sold the strip, and the price fell again to zero seven jiao. The afternoon closing was at 1130 yuan eight jiao.</p>
<p>The settlement price, according to the Central Bank's standard margin money price, was posted at 1129 yuan, only increasing by less than two yuan according to the closing price, less than the two yuan increase compared to the previous closing. The registration price for this month is 1127 yuan, August is 1131 yuan, and September is 114 yuan. The morning top-up price was 1127 yuan, and the red gold price was 1139 yuan eight jiao. The spot market situation was stable. Tianjin goods were sold by Shengyuan Yong to Yongfeng for 140 taels, adding 16 yuan. The purchase price for cooked red was 13 yuan higher, and the selling price was 16 and a half yuan, but there were no buyers.</p>
<p>There were not many transactions in the market. In summary, Yicheng, Fuxing Yong, Da Heng, Da Decheng, Yuancheng Yong, Tong Taichang, Futai Yong, Qingfa Yong, etc., were on the buying side, and Huixiang, Daf Fa Yong, Jiu Da Hengchang Yong, Da Feng Heng, Dingkang, etc., were on the selling side. Yuancheng Yong and Fuxing Yong went in first and then out, and Futai Yong and Tian Decheng went out first and then in.</p>
<p>It was observed that the half-day market situation was still weak. The morning opening was at 11312 yuan eight jiao, and the afternoon closing was at 1130 yuan eight jiao. The highest price was 1132 yuan three jiao, and the lowest price was 1130 yuan seven jiao, with a range of one yuan six jiao. As a result, the price fell by nine jiao compared to the previous closing.</p>
<p>The pre-market trading for the August-September futures market was posted by the longs at three to three and a half yuan. Wanxing once posted it at around three and a half yuan. Da Decheng, Ruixing, Yuancheng Yong, Jingfu Yicheng, and Da Feng Heng Fu Yu Tong Feng Heng immediately bought in, retreating to within three yuan. Qingfa Yong Da Heng Qia Feng Yong Wu Changxiang Yuan Yi posted, rising to three yuan three jiao. Shengyuan Yong Qian Changxiang Chun Yuan still bought in, retreating to three yuan. Da Decheng Hengchang Yong Wanxing Jiu Da Fuxing Yong tried hard to post, and although Yuancheng Yong bought in, the official opening at 10:00 AM rose to the selling side, posting three yuan four jiao. After the opening, it was still three yuan four five jiao. Qia Feng Yong Dingkang tried hard to post, as did Yicheng.

<p>After the Gold Exchange issued a notice increasing the handling fee, the brokers of the exchange held a meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss it. They decided to sympathize with the exchange, but requested that the implementation be postponed until Monday of next week. The original single-sided commission of jiao, excluding the broker's incentive bonus of 25%, meant that the exchange received 7.5 fen of national currency per strip on one side. This was reduced to 7.5 fen net for both entering and exiting, totaling one jiao. In other words, the net handling fee that brokers should pay to the exchange is 3.75 li per strip on one side. The chairman of the association negotiated with the exchange, and then a decision was made.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Although Chinese Merchants Are Closing Accounts Eagerly, Foreign Exchange Results Unchanged <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market saw banks maintain support at cheap prices yesterday, resulting in no changes in the results. At the beginning of the morning, the overseas telegrams reported that London short and long positions both decreased by 0.0625. Market sources said that after the market closed, there were Indian buyers on the board, but no sellers. The New York silver market did not move. The forward silver price in Montelieri remained unchanged. London gold rose by one and a half pence. The British pound rose against the US dollar by 0.0625, and fell against the French franc by six pounds. The US dollar decreased against the British pound by a strong 0.1875, and rose against the French franc by 0.0625. The Central Bank's posted exchange rates showed London and New York flat, and the Customs gold unit rose by two li. The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with the recent selling price: British pound at one shilling two pence three seven five, and US dollar at thirty yuan zero nine three seven five. Compared to the previous closing, the British pound and US dollar were both flat. After the opening, banks' hedging was uneven. HSBC's posted exchange rates showed London and New York flat, and the New Fung Yang Bank hedged recent US dollars. Banks were happy to trade against each other, so although the silver equalization tax decreased by two five, the process remained fluctuating. After the market opened, although confidence did not improve, banks maintained support at cheap prices. The noon trend was flat and uncertain. The afternoon closing price was the recent selling price: British pound at one shilling two pence three seven five, and US dollar at thirty yuan zero nine three seven five. Compared to the previous closing, the British pound and US dollar were both flat. The forward prices were also the same. Chinese merchants were hedging more than 100,000 US dollars. Mobil Oil bought July US dollars in British pounds and US dollars. The transaction record is listed below:</p>

The purchase price was slightly higher.</p>
<p>The US dollar opened in the morning with the recent selling price at thirty yuan zero nine three seven five. Maccary bought spot at one two five. Youli hedged July at zero six two five. Citibank sold to Xinfeng at the same price in the same month. Maccary hedged July at zero six two five. Shanghai Huabi hedged September at twenty-nine yuan eight seven five.

The purchase price was increased by zero six two five.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Securities: Government Bond Trading Mostly Swaps, Market Prices Mixed, 96 Now Inverted <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw the market situation dominated by swap transactions, resulting in a fluctuating trend. However, there was some selling from the financial sector, and confidence gradually weakened. Furthermore, the Guangdong authorities' forceful seizure of the Bank of China's customs tax deposits further caused the longs to start shaking. Militarily, it seemed that contact had already been made. The result of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee was likely to first seek domestic unification, and then resist foreign aggression. This meant that the southwest was a prerequisite problem, and the restoration of public bonds' discount for cash also meant that the financial sector would inevitably see an outflow of spot goods. The future was difficult to be optimistic about. The market initially opened with number 37 buying in and remained stable, but later numbers 4, 11, and 14 sold Class C bonds, gradually weakening and turning slightly negative by one or two jiao. Selling pressure remained strong at the close, but Class E bonds did not see a fall, only slightly negative by one jiao. The rest continued to be slightly negative by two or three jiao. The forward price of Class A bonds returned to the previous one jiao. The overall trend for the day was that Class E bonds were the most firm, rising by a good three jiao. Class D bonds also rose by a good three jiao five fen due to number 37's buyback. The rest consistently continued to be slightly negative by five fen, one jiao, to two and a half jiao. The 96 forward price was slightly negative by three jiao, and the recent price was slightly negative by five fen, resulting in an inverted market. The total number of transactions was 4.26 million yuan. The results of the price increases and decreases are listed in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>Yesterday, the hardware market was quiet. Ninety pounds of British tinplate, 150 boxes handled by the Henan group, were sold for $18.60. White lead sheets, sizes 5 and 6, were bought in large quantities by battery factories; the price for No. 5 was $128, and for No. 6 was $126. American black iron sheets had a very good trend in the market yesterday. Enamel factories, toy factories, and machine factories all made purchases, so the market was quite strong, opening at $11.75 per dan. British steel plates, I-beams, water pipes, flower garden lead wire, and shear mouth iron were all ordered by various groups and local factories, but the quantity was small, so the price did not fluctuate.</p>

<h3 id="e187">Multiple Bearish Trades Emerge, Yarn Prices Plunge, Yarn Prices Drop Three to Four Yuan in Two Days, Still Above One Yuan <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market has been hit hard, and the price drop is intensifying. This is mainly because after a period of rapid price increases, customer purchases have completely stopped, leading to market instability. Furthermore, foreign firms and manufacturers, seeing little actual trading activity and high benchmark yarn prices, are collectively selling short. As a result, the recent price decline has become even more severe. In the afternoon, securities brokers released large volumes of bearish positions, and many others followed suit, causing the market to collapse. These sudden rises and falls are entirely due to the volatile sentiments of speculators.</p>
<p>Benchmark Yarn Starts to Fall</p>
<p>At the opening of the benchmark yarn market, prices for all months were stagnant due to the high prices and the clearing of most speculative short positions. Consequently, there was a lack of buyers in the market. However, the market situation changed dramatically after the opening, with strong selling pressure and ample supply of yarn. As Osaka's Three Grades of Yarn saw declines, buyers became even scarcer. Prices for all months plummeted by 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, and 1.6 yuan. By the third closing, it was reported that spot yarn business was very slow, further weakening market sentiment. As a result, near-month contracts fell by 1.5 to 2 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, while distant-month contracts fell by 0.5, 0.6, and 0.8 yuan. At the afternoon opening, near-month contracts stabilized, while distant-month contracts rose by 0.3 and 0.4 yuan. However, after the opening, incoming Osaka Three Grades of Yarn cables showed continuous declines, prompting securities firms and gold merchants to sell off, leading to a further market collapse. Prices continued to fall until the lowest closing price was reached. As a result, prices for all months fell by 1.4 to 1.69 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was noted that Da Chang sold 3,250 bales, Tai Chang 1,100 bales, Tong Ji 1,950 bales, Ji Feng 1,100 bales, Yi Ji 1,750 bales, Ming De 800 bales, Xing Chang 850 bales, Ren Feng 1,200 bales, Chang Feng 2,800 bales, Yong Da 1,850 bales, Tong He 1,100 bales, and Xin Cheng 4,050 bales. On the buying side, Cheng Ji bought 1,000 bales, Da Fu 2,850 bales, Ju Xing 2,200 bales, Yu Da 1,550 bales, Jin Chang 2,100 bales, He Xing 2,900 bales, Shen Ji 2,150 bales, Da Chang Cheng 1,150 bales, and Sheng Yuan 700 bales. The daily high, low, and closing prices are listed below.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Weakens in the Morning, Recovers in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are sluggish. It is noted that the total purchases from various firms throughout the day amounted to 585 yuan. Morning prices saw a drop of 2 yuan for yarn and 5 yuan for thread. In the afternoon, yarn prices rose by 1 yuan and thread prices by 2 yuan. Purchase amounts for each firm are as follows:</p>
<p>Inland: 440; Fellow traders: 140; Anqing: 5</p>
<p>The cotton market is weakening, with a sharp price decline. This is largely due to the initial rise and subsequent fall of US cotton, resulting in only a slight increase. Southern cotton farmers are still selling short, easing market sentiment. Additionally, the yarn market is trending downward, and in the afternoon, securities firms and gold merchants released large volumes of positions, causing the market to gradually decline. Distant-month contracts have broken through the 3-yuan barrier.</p>
<p>This Month's Cotton Down 0.85 Yuan</p>
<p>At the opening of the benchmark cotton market, US cotton first rose and then retreated, resulting in a small increase of 3 to 6 points. It is generally expected that the upward trend can be temporarily halted. Although Indian cotton rose by 1 to 2 rupees, attention is focused on US cotton. Osaka's Three Grades of Cotton fell by 0.6 to 0.7 yuan, leading to peaceful market sentiment. Near-month contracts fell by 0.15 to 0.4 yuan, while distant-month contracts also fell by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. Given the unfavorable momentum, speculative traders rushed to sell. The second and third trading sessions remained weak. However, new cotton rebounded by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan, and at the closing, old cotton recovered slightly. As a result, old cotton fell by 0.25 to 0.3 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, while new cotton fell by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. At the afternoon opening, the market sentiment for old cotton turned upward, while new cotton fell by 0.05 to 0.15 yuan. The second and third trading sessions were uneventful. However, as the closing approached, the price decline intensified, as bond and financial firms took profits and released large volumes of positions, causing a sudden market slump. Old cotton broke through the 9-yuan mark, falling by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan across the board. New cotton fell below the 3-yuan barrier. As a result, prices for all months fell by 0.2, 0.4, and 0.5 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was noted that Yong Da sold 2,000 dan, Da Chang 3,600 dan, Ming Hua 2,000 dan, Ming De 2,000 dan, Yu Da 2,000 dan, Da Fu 3,100 dan, Da Feng 2,800 dan, Yuan... 4,500 dan, Yi Kang 3,000 dan, Shen Chang 1,200 dan, Xing Chang 1,200 dan, Cheng Ji 1,700 dan, and De Da 1,600 dan. On the buying side, Yuan Xing Chang bought 3,600 dan, Xin Cheng 3,600 dan, Tong Ji 6,000 dan, Zhen Da 1,700 dan, He Xing 4,200 dan, Shen Ji 8,000 dan, Da Chang Cheng 2,500 dan,... 2,600 dan, Yong Chang 1,200 dan, and Tong He 1,300 dan. The daily high, low, and closing prices are listed below.</p>
<p>Demand for Spot Cotton Remains Sluggish</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption remains mediocre, with sluggish mill demand. Sources: Yao cotton 340 bales, Tianjin American cotton 6.4.00. Gongda Mill purchased 100 pieces. Spot delivery to the factory: Tianjin American cotton 6.275. Gongda Mill purchased 100 pieces. Spot delivery to the factory.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Both Eastern and Western Districts Benefit from Rainfall, US Cotton Does Not Rise Much, Three Grades of Yarn and Cotton Also Fall <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton opened strongly, with positive news from Liverpool. Dealers, brokers, and foreign firms bought in, driving prices up by 12 to 15 points for all months. However, as bullish traders quickly closed their positions, and New Orleans, local firms, and cotton farmers sold short, prices retreated slightly. Parts of both the eastern and western districts benefited from rainfall. It is expected that tomorrow's weather report will be favorable, especially in Texas, which has dampened bullish sentiment. It is widely believed that the damage in parts of Georgia and the Carolinas has been alleviated by the recent rainfall. Trading volume was low. July contracts were firm, with spot prices up 4 points and futures prices up 3 to 5 points. British cotton spot prices rose by 6 pence, and futures prices rose by 6 to 8 points. Indian cotton was bought by Japanese firms, and bullish traders closed their positions. July and August contracts for White Raw Cotton were actively bought by Liverpool, making them even stronger. Plain cotton rose/fell by 0.25 to 1.25 rupees, Oomra rose by 0.25 to 2 rupees, and White Raw Cotton rose by 1.75 to 2.25 rupees. Original telegram recorded on the 14th.</p>
<p>According to a Bombay telegram, the opening forecast for the April/May contracts of White Raw Cotton on the 15th was 226.5 rupees, down 1.75 rupees from the previous day.</p>
<p>Osaka telegram on the 15th: Three Grades of Yarn futures fell by 2.6 to 3.7 yuan, with near-month contracts at 213.3 yuan and distant-month contracts at 207.2 yuan. Cotton futures fell by 0.8 to 1.55 yuan, with near-month contracts at 72.15 yuan and distant-month contracts at 65.85 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e189">Grains Wheat Prices Retreat Slightly, Flour Futures See Significant Liquidation <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market saw prices open steady in the morning, followed by a gradual decline. Opening prices for foreign wheat were based on Chicago, down about 0.3 to 0.5 yuan, and Canada, down 0.1 yuan. Due to cautious market sentiment from both bulls and bears, trading volume was low, resulting in limited price movement for all months. The market remained stable during the afternoon opening. However, as traders gradually sold off their holdings due to the inability to raise spot wheat prices, most of them sold through the exchange. These sellers seemed to believe in the realities of the market, which eased market sentiment and led to a gradual decline in opening prices. Market observers speculate that if the flour market turns sluggish, the wheat market will undoubtedly follow suit. The spot wheat market saw active arrivals, but mill demand was average. Bidding prices were generally reduced by 0.02 yuan. Opening prices were: Chuzhou wheat at 4.5 yuan, Mingguang Shaheji Guandian wheat at 4.53 yuan, Zhuzhen wheat at 4.46 yuan, Dongge wheat at 4.45 yuan, Puzhen wheat at 4.42 yuan, and Huaian wheat at 4.48 yuan. Fufeng shipped 6,000 bags, and Shen Da shipped 3,000 bags.</p>
<p>The US wheat market saw increased rainfall and cooler weather. The forecast of cooler weather and rain has raised hopes that the drought may be alleviated. As a result, although the US and Canada continued to report damages, it had little impact, and trading was relatively quiet. The market is waiting for a more definitive outlook.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat July 13 July 14 Change</p>
<p>September 103.875 102.125 Down 1.750</p>
<p>December 105.250 102.500 Down 1.750</p>
<p>Canadian Wheat</p>
<p>October 91.250 90.625 Down 0.625</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market saw limited-price openings for all months in both the morning and afternoon. While formal trading was slow, there were significant off-market liquidations. Due to the easing of the wheat market, floating longs and some clients were willing to exit their positions in the off-market, with near-month contracts down only 0.04 to 0.05 yuan, August contracts down only 0.02 to 0.03 yuan, and subsequent months also down only 0.03 to 0.05 yuan. This situation indicates that the market situation has significantly eased, and it is rumored that the Social Affairs Bureau's price limits will soon be lifted.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Thin Rice Sales Are Smooth, Prices Remain Firm <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday's supplies from various sources were still limited to 2,400 to 2,500 piculs of Grade 12 and 13 rice. However, sales in this area were slow. Despite Lianqing and Qingdao firms purchasing over 1,000 bags of thin rice, the downward trend persisted. As a result, prices for thick early japonica and thin rice all weakened slightly. Du Yang Jian's arrival and sales were both low, and market prices remained unchanged.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, supplies of Grade 12 and 13 rice from various locations along the river arrived, and the market sold off existing stocks. Fresh white japonica rice saw slight movement, with prices remaining stable. Old stocks remained sluggish, with prices down slightly. Thin rice arrivals were low and sales were active, with prices holding firm. White Yuan prices weakened by 0.03 to 0.04 yuan, and prices for high-quality Yang Jian rice weakened slightly. Prices for medium and low-quality rice were down by a small margin. Prices for Port Guest Jian rice weakened by a small margin. Prices for all other types of rice showed a downward trend.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Hot and Humid Weather Leads to Rice Hoarding Release <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Due to the lack of consistent demand from local traders, the price of glutinous rice has been steadily declining. Yesterday, traders, guest vendors, and hoarders were eager to sell off their inventory, leading to price reductions. As a result, prices for all types of rice continued to fall. In recent days, the price of mid-grade rice has fallen by nearly 1 yuan, while the price of high-quality rice has fallen by more than 0.5 to 0.6 yuan. Due to the price reductions, inland firms have shown some interest, purchasing over 2,000 bags of Xiangjing and Zhongguan Gan early and late rice. Local traders also lowered prices to compete, leading to a slightly more active market. Total daily trading volume was around 5,000 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Silk and Tea US and Japanese Silk Markets Both Decline <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the overseas silk markets remained stable. The New York and Yokohama silk markets did not see any significant price fluctuations. New York spot prices fell slightly by 0.01 yuan, and futures prices fell slightly by 0.005 yuan. Yokohama spot prices fell by 3 yuan, and futures prices rose by 1 yuan. Prices for goods of Chinese origin in New York and quotations in the Lyon silk market remained unchanged. Both domestic and overseas silk markets remained firm and stagnant, with very little trading activity.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the rayon market saw active buying interest. However, hoarders were hesitant to sell, leading to moderate trading activity. Prices for 120-denier Sunlight brand were around 400 yuan for over 20 boxes, and prices for 120-denier Sky Bridge brand were over 400 yuan. Due to limited inventory, traders were reluctant to sell at reduced prices. A major local firm, feeling that its inventory was low and the market was stable, ordered 200 boxes of 120-denier bright Italian Sniade No. 3 goods from Carlowitz &amp; Co., at a price of 100 yuan per bill of lading. The firm's asking price was also 100 yuan.</p>

<p>Yichang black tea has recently been shipped to Shanghai for sale. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. and Zhongxin Chang Tea Firm agreed to a deal for over 700 boxes, with prices ranging from 67 to 87 yuan. The market remained stable. Qining black tea continued to see active sales for high and mid-grade goods, while low-grade goods remained sluggish. Due to the surge in arrivals, Huaxiang broken leaf tea prices continued to decline. As for the green tea market, yesterday, various foreign firms, seeing that inventories of early-spring Tunxi Zhenmei were low, actively purchased them, resulting in a total trading volume of over 1,000 boxes, with Tianyu, Jinlong, and Tongfu being the most active. Selling prices ranged from 80 to 86 yuan, slightly firmer than before. Trading in other types of Zhenmei was relatively slow. In addition, due to the surge in daily arrivals of Sui'an Zhenmei, and its inferior quality, sales remained sluggish. From this perspective, the prospects for second-flush green tea are not optimistic.</p>

<h3 id="e194">Piece Goods Dye Works Are Eager to Purchase Fine Cloth <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>With benchmark yarn and cotton prices declining for consecutive days, market sentiment has gradually weakened. However, due to the fact that mills are still unable to make a profit at current selling prices, and dye works are placing large orders for colored cloth for July and August, most mills have already replenished their stocks of white cloth from Japanese factories. As a result, mill stocks have already been sold. Dye works are also eagerly purchasing large quantities of local machine-made fine cloth this month, making deliveries very urgent. Therefore, market momentum remains firm. Demand for colored cloth from the Sichuan and Yangtze firms is most urgent this month. Due to the new Yangtze River shipping regulations, which calculate freight based on the size of the container, and which are scheduled to take effect on the 16th, various traders are rushing to ship their goods before the deadline, leading to extremely frequent cargo traffic recently. Yesterday, firms along the Yangtze River, such as Hankou, Changsha, and Nanchang, shipped over 200 pieces of white cloth, fine cloth, fine twill, and coarse cloth, as well as over 300 pieces of broadcloth, tribute silk, blue cloth, plain twill, and gray twill. In addition to the Yangtze firms, businesses in Bengbu and Anhui also saw improved sales of colored cloth, white cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill. Sales in all other areas were sluggish.</p>

<p>Yesterday's sugar market trend was stable, with less trading activity. The association's price list for goods such as Grade 24 coarse granulated sugar, white sugar, and Dongbai Nos. 4, 8, and 9 spot goods, as well as transit goods, remained unchanged, with few transactions. Prices for goods from local factories such as Bai Jin Xin, Da Hua, and Zhen Ji also did not fluctuate. The price list included 136 bags of Chaozhou firm's Chung Ti Qing, at 10.9 yuan; 110 bags of secondary Zhuang Zhi Yang, at 11.5 yuan; 240 bags of high and medium Zhuang Zhi Yang, at 14.6 yuan; and dozens of bags of secondary Zhi Chi, at 11.1 yuan. It is reported that Shantou exchange rates remain unstable, with rumors of a return to 1,310 yuan.</p>
<p>The joint venture company held its second bidding session for Guangdong sugar this week. The total allocation was 7,357 bags, and the bid prices remained unchanged. The resulting trading volume was low, as firms had already made significant purchases last week. Yesterday, 400 bags of City Center Granulated White were sold at 19.3 yuan, and 50 bags of No. 4 Mianbai were sold at 20.6 yuan. The remaining products, such as Wuyang Coarse White from factories in Shunde, Dongguan, and Qu Creek, did not sell at the original prices.</p>

<p>Since the introduction of new golden lily flowers, goods from Xuzhou Zhongxing and other sources have been arriving in Shanghai in increasing quantities. Yesterday, the first batch of 199 bags of Zhongxing lily flowers was transferred to the warehouse for sale. However, their color was inferior to that of Xuzhou goods, so they were sold at a discount of 0.5 yuan. It is also reported that production prices for Xuzhou lily flowers have eased slightly. Northern goods industry members had previously formed a public company last year to standardize prices and eliminate competition. It is now reported that industry leaders are initiating a reorganization of the company, following the example of last year. A total of 76 shares will be issued, with over 20 companies participating.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Yin Yu <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>By Zihan</p>
<p>After Emperor Huizong and Emperor Qinzong of the Song Dynasty were captured by the Jin Dynasty, Emperor Gaozong crossed the Yangtze River and established the capital in Hangzhou. The lost territories in the north were never recovered, and only half of the country was preserved. During the reign of Emperor Lizong, the appointment of the useless Jia Sidao further worsened the situation. At this time, the Jin Dynasty was already weakening, while the Mongols in the north—under the name of Yuan—were rising in power and eventually destroyed the Jin Dynasty.</p>
<p>After Emperor Lizong died, Emperor Qingzong ascended the throne and continued to employ Jia Sidao. In the fifth year of Emperor Qingzong's reign, the Yuan Dynasty ordered General Bayan to lead a large army to attack the Song Dynasty. They besieged Xiangyang in northern Hubei for five years, and Jia Sidao did not send troops to relieve the siege. The defending general, Lü Wenhuan, had no choice but to surrender. After capturing Xiangyang, Bayan led his troops to take Hanyang and Wuchang, also successfully seizing them. Bayan ordered his men to guard Hubei, while he and Azhu led their troops and warships down the river to capture Hangzhou, the capital of the Southern Song Dynasty.</p>
<p>At that time, Wen Tianxiang was secluded in Wenshan, Jiangxi, reading books. Upon hearing that the Yuan army was advancing eastward down the river, he used patriotic rhetoric to inspire the local heroes to raise an army to defend the emperor. However, the treacherous minister Chen Yizhong, the Right Chancellor, did not want Wen Tianxiang to come to Hangzhou and ordered him to station his troops in Nanchang, Jiangxi. Before long, the Yuan army swept all before them and reached the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Hangzhou was in a state of panic and finally summoned Wen Tianxiang to bring his troops to Hangzhou. In August of the first year of Emperor Gongzong's reign, Wen Tianxiang arrived in Hangzhou. In September, he was appointed Prefect of Suzhou by imperial decree. On October 15th, Wen Tianxiang arrived in Suzhou. At that time, the Yuan army had already besieged Changzhou.</p>
<p>Wen Tianxiang ordered his subordinates Zhu Hua and Ma Shilong to lead the Guangxi troops, and Yin Yu to lead the Jiangxi troops, to join Zhang Quan's Huai army to relieve Changzhou.</p>
<p>However, Zhang Quan was a useless fellow and was also at odds with the other generals. On October 26th, they encountered the Yuan army at Henglin Yuqiao, and a fierce battle ensued. Ma Shilong was killed in action, and Zhang Quan did not come to his aid, fleeing back to Wumu. Wumu was where Zhu Hua was stationed, and Zhu Hua wanted to set up barricades and dig trenches, but Zhang Quan refused to allow it.</p>
<p>On the 27th, the Yuan army attacked Wumu, and Zhu Hua opened the camp gate and led his Guangxi troops to fight the Yuan army. The battle lasted from morning to afternoon, with heavy casualties on both sides, but no decisive victory was achieved. The Yuan army also retreated.</p>
<p>That night, the Yuan army circled around to the back of the mountain to attack the Jiangxi camp of Yin Yu. Yin Yu was a general in the Jiangxi military administration and had followed Wen Tianxiang since he raised his army. Yin Yu was straightforward and skilled in martial arts. He often said, "The Zhao imperial family was misguided in trusting Qin Hui and harming Yue Wumu Wang, which prevented the recovery of lost territory. Later, Emperor Lizong employed the traitor Jia Sidao, making the country's affairs even worse. Without loyal and righteous people, how can the country prosper? I, Yin Yu, have a strong will and have mastered martial arts. Given the opportunity, I will surely serve the country."</p>
<p>Later, Yin Yu heard that Wen Tianxiang had raised an army in Jizhou, Jiangxi, to defend the emperor. He was overjoyed and said, "Master Wen is a good man. Now he is raising an army to save the country. Who else should I, Yin Yu, sell this body and these skills to but to Master Wen?"</p>
<p>Therefore, Yin Yu bid farewell to his family and, alone on horseback, went to Jizhou to join Wen Tianxiang.</p>
<p>Wen Tianxiang was pleased with Yin Yu's dignified appearance and imposing presence. However, Wen Tianxiang was still unsure of Yin Yu's loyalty and tested him, saying, "The Yuan army is strong, and our efforts to defend the emperor may not succeed. We may even suffer a major defeat and lose our lives. General, this is a dangerous matter, and you must think it over."</p>
<p>Yin Yu replied loudly, "Master Wen, do not underestimate Yin Yu. If a true man cannot establish merit and achieve success, and use this useful body to serve the country, would he simply spend his life guarding his wife? In coming here, Yin Yu has already stopped considering life and death as separate matters, and considers us as one. We are doing this for the country!"</p>
<p>Wen Tianxiang was overjoyed and patted Yin Yu's back, saying, "General, you are truly a loyal and righteous man!"</p>
<p>Yin Yu followed Wen Tianxiang in Nanchang, Hangzhou, and Suzhou.</p>
<p>That day, upon receiving Wen Tianxiang's order, he went to Changzhou with Zhu Hua to relieve the siege. Zhu Hua set up his main camp on the main road of Wumu, while Yin Yu set up his camp on the key pass behind the mountain.</p>
<p>On the 27th of October, in the first year of Emperor Gongzong's reign, when the Yuan army attacked Wumu and engaged in a fierce battle with Zhu Hua, Yin Yu wanted to lead his troops to relieve the siege, but the road behind the mountain was too important, and he dared not leave his post without authorization. In case of any mishap, what would he do! He was anxious and paced back and forth on his horse, clenching his teeth and gnawing, holding his spear, watching the dust billowing in front of the mountain, and listening to the battle cries shaking the earth in front of the mountain. Yin Yu's life was truly unbearable that day.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the Yuan army retreated, and Zhu Hua led his troops back to camp. Yin Yu also breathed a sigh of relief. However, Yin Yu still dared not be careless and ordered, "Although the enemy soldiers are northerners, they are still just as cunning in their tactics. Although they have retreated today, they may very well return. We must be even more careful tonight. Tonight, no one is allowed to remove their armor, and the horses are not allowed to remove their saddles. Be vigilant!"</p>
<p>As Yin Yu had expected, that night, the Yuan army divided its 100,000 troops into two groups. One group attacked Zhu Hua's main camp on the main road of Wumu, while the other group attacked Yin Yu's camp on the key pass behind the mountain, preventing the Song troops from supporting each other.</p>
<p>Yin Yu was in the central command tent, reading under the candlelight, when he heard distant shouts and the neighing of horses. He knew that the Yuan army had come to raid the camp. At the same time, a hidden sentinel came to report that the Yuan army was raiding the camp. Fortunately, no one had removed their armor, and the horses had not been unsaddled. Upon Yin Yu's command, the entire camp was roused, and the camp gates were opened. Yin Yu mounted his horse, raised his spear, charged out of the camp gate, and met the Yuan army head-on.</p>
<p>The 50,000 Yuan soldiers carried lanterns and torches, making it as bright as day. They came sweeping down the mountains and plains. Seeing such a sight, even the bravest would be terrified. Therefore, even before the battle began, the camps of Zeng Tong, Hu Yu, Xie Yun, and Zeng Yu collapsed, Zhang Quan's army fled, and Zhu Hua's troops were cut off by the Yuan army and could not provide support. Only Yin Yu and his 500 men were left to face the 50,000 Yuan soldiers sweeping down the mountains and plains.</p>
<p>Seeing that several camps had collapsed, Yin Yu cursed through gritted teeth, "These cowardly cowards!" He then said to his 500 men, "Brothers, my good friends, you have always been of one mind with me. Today is our good opportunity to serve the country! Brothers, even if we are down to one man, we must fight the enemy. Killing one enemy is enough, killing two is profit! Brothers, give it your all!"</p>
<p>The 500 men replied in unison, "We will be with the general in life and death!"</p>
<p>Yin Yu shouted, "Good! You are truly Yin Yu's good brothers! Good! Let us charge forward!"</p>
<p>The 500 men shouted in unison, spurred on their warhorses, and charged towards the Yuan army like a whirlwind. Yin Yu was in the lead, and with each thrust of his spear, he knocked several Yuan soldiers off their horses. Like a cloud of fire, the 500 men plunged into the Yuan army's ranks.</p>
<p>Bayan was overseeing the battle in the central command, and when he saw the front army scatter to the sides, he hurriedly spurred on his horse to take a look. He saw a Song general with several hundred Song soldiers, like a pack of fierce tigers, charging left and right in the enemy ranks, as if entering an empty field.</p>
<p>Bayan was shocked and quickly raised his saber, spurred on his horse to meet him, and shouted, "Stop, General of the Southern Dynasty! Look at my Great Yuan's 50,000 soldiers here, and another 50,000 soldiers in front of the mountain, surrounding you on all sides. General, what can your few hundred men accomplish? Why not dismount and surrender to the Great Yuan? Once you take the Southern Dynasty's lands, you will be granted land and ennobled. It will not be lacking for you. General, what do you think?"</p>
<p>Hearing this, Yin Yu cursed, "You vile dog, shut your mouth! I am a Song man in life, and a Song ghost in death! Even if I die in battle, I will not surrender. You vile dog, do not think that I have few men. My 500 men will still kill you until men and horses are overturned."</p>
<p>After saying this, Yin Yu thrust his spear and charged straight at Bayan. Bayan turned his horse slightly and retreated, waving his command flag, tightening the encirclement of 50,000 men. Unable to kill Bayan, Yin Yu could only engage in a mixed battle with his 500 men in the Yuan army's ranks. The Yuan soldiers grew in number, and Yin Yu fought more and more bravely, fighting all through the night.</p>
<p>Yin Yu saw that his troops were gradually dwindling, and that both he and his horse were bearing many wounds. His armor was soaked in blood, and his horse was also covered in blood. However, Yin Yu had no intention of retreating and continued to fight with all his might. As Yin Yu fought on, he grew exhausted and could no longer hold on. Knowing that the situation was dire, he cried out, "Ancestors of the Great Song, Master Wen, Yin Yu is exhausted..." Before he could finish speaking, he spat out blood and fell off his horse!</p>
<p>Yin Yu was dead, but the remaining troops under his command continued to fight to the death. The battle lasted until dawn, with the Yuan soldiers leaving corpses strewn across the field and blood flowing like rivers. Only four of the 500 men survived, and none of them surrendered. This battle at Wumu truly terrified the Yuan soldiers.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Darwin and His Theory of Evolution <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Guo Xuan</p>
<p>(Charles Darwin 1809——1882)</p>
<p>In the first chapter of the old biblical Genesis, it is recorded the story of God creating man. It says that God first created the sun, moon, stars, mountains, rivers, grass, and trees, and finally molded yellow earth into man. This man was male, named Adam. Adam then took a rib and turned it into a woman, named Eve. Adam and Eve were the ancestors of us human beings. Such words were universally accepted in past eras, and no one dared to criticize them. In China, we also have the legend of creating man from yellow earth, and the oldest emperor, Pangu, is said to have been born from within the universe like a chicken egg. We now consider these many theories of human origin to be absurd and unfounded. Why? Because Darwin's theory of evolution has replaced them.</p>
<p>The name of Darwin's book on the theory of evolution is "On the Origin of Species." For over a hundred years, this book has become a world-renowned masterpiece, and there are several Chinese translations of it. The essence of the theory of evolution is to overturn the idea that God created all things, and to deny the theory that all things are immutable. It says that everything evolves from simple organisms to more advanced ones. Therefore, all species are constantly changing. The ancient theory that the ancestors of various organisms have not changed from their present state is incorrect. In other words, any ancient organism may be different from the current one. The evidence is that we have discovered many strange ancient bones that have become fossils (these animals cannot be found in the current world) and many facts of biological variation. As for us humans, we naturally evolved from other animals, but we have evolved to the highest stage at present. We know that the life, habits, physiological structure, and intelligence of apes are most similar to humans, so we can conclude that humans evolved from apes, and apes evolved from other mammals. Tracing back in this way, we can trace all the way back to the simplest single-celled organisms, such as protozoa. The cell is the basic unit that constitutes living things. Small individual, single-celled organisms are small things that only have one cell, almost invisible to the human eye. Just think, to say that we humans came from this thing, isn't that a surprising theory? But don't think it's strange, this is absolutely true, because Darwin has found many pieces of evidence from the changes in plants and animals to convince you! Moreover, this kind of change takes a very long time. For example, from apes to humans, it is not known how many stages are in between, and each stage is often tens of thousands of years. If we use the changes in human affairs as a ratio, then we simply cannot see anything evolving there, because it is too slow. So why do all living things change? To put it simply, it is for the sake of adapting to the environment. Darwin's discovery on this point is indeed worthy of praise, and he has provided us with a wealth of examples as evidence. Here, we will first cite a few of the most obvious pieces of evidence for biological evolution:</p>
<p>The first piece is anatomical evidence. When we dissect a person or other animal, we often find useless, degenerate organs, such as the "cecum" of humans and gorillas. Not only is this thing of no use at all, but it often causes the dangerous condition of "appendicitis." If humans were created by God, why would there be such a useless organ? But if we observe things like rabbits, their cecum is very developed and also very useful. Thus, we can know that both humans and apes have gone through the stage of rabbits. When its environment changed later, and its life changed, it no longer needed the cecum, so it slowly degenerated and became its present shape. After many years, we can almost conclude that humans will no longer develop a cecum. The same principle applies to the fact that humans still retain traces of a tail. (Darwin found more than eighty such degenerated organs on the human body!)</p>
<p>The second piece is the fact of comparing the same species of animals. For example, insects, we all know that they should have six legs and four wings, but due to different living environments, many variations have emerged. Parasites such as lice and fleas no longer have wings because they do not need to fly at all! The hind wings of flies have also become non-existent. Also, the mouthparts of insects vary greatly in shape due to the different things they eat. Butterflies have long antennae, which grasshoppers do not have. But if you examine them closely, they are all made up of an upper lip, a lower lip, a pair of upper jaws, and a pair of lower mandibles. Also, birds all have wings, but ostriches living in the desert do not use their wings, so they are very undeveloped, while their feet walk exceptionally fast.</p>
<p>The third piece is the fact of embryology: Ordinary organisms are all born from eggs, and humans are also born from the union of a maternal egg and a sperm. Therefore, in the evolution of the human fetus, the evolutionary process of general organisms is revealed. It will have gills, it will have a tail, it will look like a fish for a while, and it will look like a beast for a while. This indicates that the ancestors of humans have gone through this stage.</p>
<p>The fourth piece is the ancient biological situation glimpsed from fossils. Because the age of the Earth's formation is very long, there have been too many changes on the surface. People who study the Earth divide the entire Earth from ancient times into four major periods: the Archean Eon, the Paleozoic Era, the Mesozoic Era, and the Cenozoic Era, and then divide each period into several epochs. In the strata of each epoch, there are fossils of the remains of organisms from that era. Now we find that the older the strata, the more fossils of simple and lower plants and animals they contain. There are very few fossils in the Archean Eon, only some lower organisms; only in the Paleozoic Era are there fish fossils, but these fish are completely different from the fish of today; in the Mesozoic Era, there were many amphibians and reptiles, such as frogs and lizards. As for bird fossils, they only appeared in the late Mesozoic Era and the early Cenozoic Era. This is truly ironclad evidence of biological evolution!</p>
<p>Furthermore, why do living things have to adapt to the environment? Darwin put forward two principles: natural selection and artificial selection; and the principles of "struggle for existence" and "survival of the fittest."</p>
<p>In terms of artificial selection, he cited many variations of organisms raised by humans as examples. The most famous is the variation of domestic pigeons: Due to human needs, there are pigeons with protruding chests, peacock tails, and fleshy balls on their eyes. This is because humans use the inherent variability of organisms to select the kind of seeds that meet their purposes and allow their offspring to reproduce. After a long time, they gradually develop into various kinds of variations. This is called artificial selection. (You can understand why the goldfish in Zhongshan Park in Beijing have so many novel appearances, right?) He intended to publish it in the society's journal. Coincidentally, the officers of the association, Lyell and Hooker, already knew that Darwin had done in-depth research on this issue, so they advised him to write a short essay with his opinions and publish it simultaneously in the July issue of the journal. In November 1859, Darwin supplemented many opinions and made a book, which is now the "On the Origin of Species" that everyone reads.</p>
<p>When Wallace learned that his theory was the same as Darwin's, but Darwin's research was earlier, and his arguments were rich and his thinking was profound, he was willing to give this credit to Darwin. He even called his own work "Darwinism." This kind of humility is still praised in the scientific community today, and it is many times stronger than those scholars who copy and plagiarize and pretend to be their own.</p>
<p>The church was very opposed to Darwin at first, but later it became silent and odorless.</p>
<p>Darwin gained widespread belief in England and became a first-class scientist and thinker in the world, but his research did not decline until his later years. In 1882, he died amid national mourning, and his remains were buried in Westminster Abbey, which is dedicated to burying British dignitaries.</p>

<p>— Zhuang Xinzai</p>
<p>As for magazines and periodicals, there are many specialized political science magazines in foreign countries, but China pitifully doesn't have a single one. Although there is a weekly magazine in Nanjing named "Political Review" and a monthly magazine called "Political Monthly," the former is actually just a general current affairs publication covering a wide range of topics, and the latter is even more immature and superficial. Nankai University in Tianjin publishes a "Journal of Political Economy," which has more substantial content, but it inevitably has a bias towards economics, as some have already pointed out. Therefore, if we want to read papers on political science, we can only find them in more research-oriented general magazines. Shanghai's "Eastern Miscellany" and "Cultural Construction Monthly," Tianjin's "Guowen Weekly," Wuhan's "Wuhan University Social Science Quarterly," and Nanjing's "Central University Social Science Quarterly" all often publish more sound and insightful political essays, which should be given special attention by political science researchers. In addition, the "Administrative Efficiency Bi-monthly," which is more specialized in nature, is a very meaningful new publication. As for magazines on international politics, there are too many of them in China.</p>
<p>The development of a country's political science is directly proportional to the progress of its actual politics. When it comes to safe and sound politics, Britain should be praised. Britain is also the most prosperous in political science. Since the Xinhai Revolution in China, there have been many people studying political science, but the development of modern industrial science has made politics gradually despised by the public, and some people even believe that there are too many people engaged in politics. There are even proposals to temporarily suspend the enrollment of new students in the faculties of law and politics, but they do not know that political science in China is still suffering from its immaturity! In reality, not a single political scientist has been cultivated, and even a "Chinese" political masterpiece cannot be found. Political science in China is only declining, and China's politics has therefore failed to see a bright and prosperous opportunity. Therefore, if we want China's politics to get on track and make China an organized modern country, we can only improve and refine, and we must never abandon eating because of choking. In addition to re-evaluating "politics," which has always been despised, so that the people have a new and correct understanding of politics, we should also promote the in-depth study of political science, improve the quality of political publications, and cultivate politicians in the new China. Cultivating people with new political common sense, habits of new political training, and cultivating specialized and educated new politicians are the fundamental key to promoting practical politics in China.</p>

<p>— Bao Bing</p>
<p>A publication that deserves attention</p>
<p>In the publishing world where ancient books are reprinted and readers are tempted with erotic texts and photographs of human body models, if we want to buy a magazine with rigorous awareness and correct ideas to read, after searching through thousands of publications, it can be said that there are not many with a style like 'Yue Feng'. The reason for this is partly due to the publishing world's failure to take responsibility for improving culture, and partly due to the readers' lack of discernment, thus creating a situation of 'only profit is sought, and crude production is rampant'.</p>
<p>'Yue Feng' magazine is a bi-monthly publication published by Yue Feng Society on Renhe Road in Hangzhou. From the publication of the first issue to the present, a total of fourteen issues have been published. The editor is Huang Pingsun, a service worker at the Hangzhou Education Department. Their slogan is: 'Not to confuse the world with humor, not to make a name with strange theories', using new ideas and writing styles to organize historical facts and local literature; at the same time, focusing on the awakening of national consciousness, hoping to use the power of words to boost morale in the face of the current serious national crisis.</p>
<p>The authors in this publication are mostly well-known figures in the current Chinese literary world, such as Zhou Zuoren, Yan Jicheng, Gao Yuetian, Jin Liang, Shao Yuanchong, Chen Bulei, Xu Yishi, Yu Dafu, Ye Shaojun, Xia Mianzun, and Liu Yazi, etc., and the works they write also focus on describing historical facts. Therefore, according to investigations, since the publication of 'Yue Feng', through the efforts of the editors and authors, more than 8,000 copies have been sold, which has naturally won a lot of praise from readers. Because there are many valuable historical materials that have never been excavated, now, after the meticulous organization by the authors of 'Yue Feng', supplemented by the authors' personal insights and criticisms, it has become a stimulating publication that is very much needed by the times!</p>
<p>Although some of the authors of 'Yue Feng' are too old-fashioned in their writing, and often use classical Chinese to narrate events and people, which is inconvenient for readers who have no cultivation in classical literature, from the standpoint of rigorous awareness and correct ideas, it can be said to be a publication that deserves attention among recent publications.</p>

<h3 id="e202">Rationalized New Gonorrhea Medicine <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>Scientific progress is rapid, especially in medicine. In recent years, there have been new discoveries in the treatment of gonorrhea. Gonococci are cunning microorganisms that are good at scurrying around. Once they enter the human body, they are like mercury spilling on the ground, penetrating every pore. As a result, the symptoms are dangerous and difficult to cure completely. If an agent with too strong bactericidal power is used, it will often damage healthy tissues, giving the gonococci an opportunity to take advantage of. Many bactericidal drugs can only work in one part and not in others. If the bactericidal power is weak, it is difficult to move the gonococci's hair. On the contrary, it will expand its power and spread to various parts. Moreover, many gonorrhea drugs often cause nausea and loss of appetite after taking them, which is the most unreasonable thing.</p>
<p>However, the drug "Klinnon" invented by Peter can be called the most rational gonorrhea medicine, because the raw materials of "Klinnon" are composed of bactericidal and antitoxic agents that have been purified of side effects. After taking it, it can produce anti-gonococcal immunity in the body in the shortest possible time, and it can directly attack the bacterial nest without damaging other tissues. Therefore, no matter which part of the body the gonococci are scurrying around in, "Klinnon" can surround and capture the bacteria, so that there is no effect of escaping the net. Therefore, this medicine can be unique in the medical field and famous in the world. For local gonorrhea such as prostatitis, anterior and posterior urethritis, and orchitis, and systemic infections such as arthritis and periostitis, as well as women's gonococcal leukorrhea, inflammation, uterine inflammation, and oophoritis, taking "Klinnon" can achieve miraculous results. Moreover, because the bactericidal effect of this medicine is complete, there is no recurrence of residual poison. This is especially difficult for other drugs to achieve.</p>
<h3 id="e203">New Review of Hypogonadism and Its Treatment <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>The symptoms of hypogonadism are short stature, haggard appearance, dry and withered muscles, and armor plating (i.e., fish scale-like). Not only is the body unhealthy, but offspring are also hopeless. The reason for this is mostly caused by masturbation in adolescence, which damages the endocrine system. Therefore, although in the prime of life, they are as decadent as the elderly. Excessive sexual activity after marriage can also lead to insufficient endocrine function, which can cause neurasthenia, poor memory, dull mind, mental trance, insomnia, and headache. In men, it can cause spermatorrhea and failure of the lower body to develop. In women, it can cause irregular menstruation, infertility after long-term marriage, and leukorrhea, which completely destroys the happiness of both men and women. The stability of society and the foundation of the country are shaken.</p>
<p>For the treatment of this disease, endocrine therapy has been popular recently, but its effects are not satisfactory. According to reports from medical experts in various countries, the male "Bodytone" and female "Beautytone" drugs invented by Dr. Merlin are the fastest-acting. The raw materials are hormones extracted from the testicles and ovaries of brave animals, and are made by scientific methods. For diseases such as hypogonadism in both men and women, it can best promote endocrine function and promote the metabolism of reproductive cells. To help growth and transform decay into youth, such as spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, palpitations, lack of energy in doing things, inability to move actively, white hair, pale complexion, and wrinkles on the forehead, all can be cured within a few weeks after taking it. In women, menstrual difficulties and incomplete development of breasts and buttocks are also completely cured due to the stimulation of follicles and the promotion of new cells. Therefore, this medicine is very popular in European and American countries. The reason is that these two drugs have substantial, rapid, and lasting effects, with no side effects.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Effective Treatment of Leukorrhea <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Leukorrhea is the most common disease in women. Because it is common, it is often neglected, and 90% of all female diseases are caused by leukorrhea. In addition to the constant flow of foul-smelling liquid in the vagina, patients also have local erosion, inflammation of the vulva, abdominal distension, and the local area feels hot and painful when urinating. This can cause irregular menstruation, back pain, and weak legs. Sometimes, if invaded by pyogenic bacteria, there is always pus and blood flowing down. It is a very harmful disease in terms of hygiene.</p>
<p>"Carter-Scott Vaginal Tablets" is an effective treatment for leukorrhea. It functions to cleanse secretions in the vagina, resist foreign bacteria, relieve pain and reduce inflammation? It is applicable to both old and new leukorrhea. Take one tablet and insert it into the vaginal canal before going to bed each time, and wash it off the next morning. Treating it in this way for several weeks will always work. There is no stimulation when using it, but if it is caused by a husband's gonorrhea infection, you can also take "Klinnon." If it is caused by physical weakness and incomplete development, you can also take "Beautytone," which will be more effective and you can still have children as usual after recovery.</p>

<p>Easily Overlooked Prostatitis</p>
<p>The so-called easily overlooked prostatitis is a disease caused by gonococci invading the prostate. At first, the patient does not suffer much pain from the symptoms, so it is most easily overlooked and not treated. However, then there is gradually a feeling of difficulty in urination. Frequent urination, burning pain in the urethra when urinating. The front part of the anus is also swollen. At this time, the patient pays attention and seeks treatment because he feels the above-mentioned pains. If reasonable treatment is given, it can be completely cured in a short period of time.</p>
<p>However, if the above-mentioned painful symptoms gradually disappear when acute gonorrhea is not treated carefully. The urine also gradually becomes clear, from clear to completely transparent. At this time, the patient thinks that his gonorrhea has completely healed by itself. Therefore, everything he does is no different from usual. As a result, it is the root of recurrence. Over time, it will develop into prostate leakage, which will affect fertility. This is a symptom that should be paid attention to in gonorrhea. Originally, the transparency of urine in gonorrhea cannot be used as evidence of a complete cure for gonorrhea, because the gonococci are latent in the prostate. Even in the first urination in the morning, there are no traces of gonorrhea, because it is not easy to observe with the naked eye. If you use a microscope to examine it, you can see it. However, patients often ignore it because of this. For the treatment of this disease, you cannot rely solely on simple treatment. The best method is to use prostate massage and electrotherapy. At the same time, you can take Klinn's special medicine internally to kill bacteria, reduce inflammation, and restore its normal state. It can always be cured completely in the shortest period of time. However, this disease is most easily transmitted to wives, and thus becomes gonococcal leukorrhea. It is also advisable to take Klinn's special medicine internally, and use vaginal tablets as suppositories externally, which will always be quickly cured.</p>

<p>Robust Treatment for Lung Disease</p>
<p>Regarding the treatment of lung disease, there has been great progress in recent centuries. Various newly manufactured internal medicines or injectable preparations are sold in an endless stream. Among drug therapies, iodine preparations and calcium salicylate are more appreciated. However, it is not easy to find a perfect and flawless option for disease absorption, nutritional improvement, and physical enhancement. Generally speaking, so-called new drugs only achieve partial effects, such as relieving coughs and eliminating phlegm, increasing appetite, or stopping bleeding and reducing fever, providing temporary relief. These are all symptomatic treatments rather than radical cures.</p>
<p>However, for lung disease patients, regardless of how long they have been ill, the cause is often the weakening of physical strength, allowing tuberculosis bacteria to take advantage and flourish. Therefore, the principle of treatment should be to strengthen the whole body and the resistance of lung tissue.</p>
<p>After numerous experiments and practical tests, various robust ingredients from animal, plant, and mineral sources were extracted to create a medicine called "Lung-Nourishing Nal." Its function is to effectively restore lung tissue and increase the phagocytic power of white blood cells around tuberculosis lesions, thereby eliminating the pathogens and achieving a radical cure. It is pure in nature and potent in effect. Its robust nourishing power is not a problem even when taken in hot weather. It excels at treating pulmonary tuberculosis with hemoptysis, cough, thick sputum, chest pain, night sweats, tidal fever, and emaciation. It can also stop spasms and inflammation of the trachea. It is effective for asthma, chronic cough, whooping cough in children, colds, excessive phlegm, etc. However, lung disease often complicates neurasthenia, insomnia, palpitations, etc. In women, it can cause irregular menstruation, and in men, it can cause seminal emission. "Female Beauty Supplement" and "Lung-Nourishing Nal" can be taken together separately to regulate menstruation and strengthen the body. Alternatively, men can take "Body-Strengthening Kang" to nourish the brain and generate essence, thereby greatly strengthening the body. It is truly an ideal and practically proven therapy for restoring vitality.</p>
<h3 id="e207">A LYMPH REMEDY THAT DEFINITELY ACHIEVES UNPRECEDENTED CLINICAL SUCCESS <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Dai De</p>
<p>In the past, the treatment of gonorrhea mainly adopted the method of injection. As for surgery, there were electrotherapy and mechanical therapies. However, because injected drugs were often difficult to produce the expected results and patients were also unable to endure long-term injections, they were not very popular. Later, the concept of transmembrane sterilization therapy was advocated, and it was temporarily effective when used for external treatment. However, this was only a local treatment and could not eradicate toxins in the body. In recent times, pigment preparations have become popular, and although they are effective, they are extremely harmful if their extraction is impure. Therefore, they must be disinfected using scientific procedures before use. However, among various gonorrhea drugs, pigment preparations are indeed relatively effective.</p>
<p>For the extraction of pigments, the latest scientific methods must be used to remove the crude materials and obtain the pure substance, so that the effectiveness will be evident and side effects can be avoided.</p>
<p>Since Spiethoff's research, pigments have been combined with other anti-inflammatory and analgesic products, as well as animal and plant lipids, and Peter created the holy gonorrhea medicine "Kelinong" by following his teacher's methods. This is the latest improved non-specific therapy that is popular in various countries today. It has indeed achieved unprecedentedly good clinical results in the treatment of gonorrhea, such as acute urethritis, systemic gonococcal arthritis, and chronic inflammation of the male prostate, bladder, and testicles. It is effective in treating female vulva, vaginal, and uterine gonorrhea, and completely eradicates the disease in a short period of time. There is no risk of recurrence for life. However, when purchasing, do not easily trust others to confuse you and mistakenly purchase cheap, miscellaneous, and inferior drugs, which may lead to life-threatening dangers after taking them. Be sure to recognize the real "Kelinong" brand! This medicine is not only effective and pure in quality, but it also has no adverse effects on the stomach or any other side effects. It excels at increasing the body's resistance to toxins to generate natural anti-gonococcal and bactericidal functions!</p>
<h3 id="e208">SYMPTOMS OF SUMMER WEARINESS AND ATTENTION TO THE GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Dai De</p>
<p>When the weather is hot, our bodies experience various physiological adjustments due to the increased temperature in order to maintain health. If these adaptive functions are impaired, the body will feel unwell. Symptoms include loss of appetite, mental fatigue, reluctance to work, chest tightness, weakness in the limbs, and weight loss, often leading to chronic indigestion. Many chronic gastrointestinal diseases originate in the summer, which is a clear example. Also, carelessness with food in the summer can easily lead to acute gastrointestinal catarrh, vomiting, and diarrhea, which must be thoroughly eradicated. According to the clinical experience of doctors, the medicine "Strong Stomach Essence" is the most appreciated for treatment. According to the pharmacological effects of this medicine, it is harmless to physiology. On the one hand, it revitalizes cell activity and enhances its defensive function, thereby eliminating summer weariness, restoring physical strength, increasing appetite sharply, and making the mind lively.</p>
<p>As for vomiting and diarrhea in acute gastrointestinal diseases, internal disinfection and antisepsis are required to eliminate fermented substances. "Strong Stomach Essence" has these effects due to the yeast it contains, so it cures the disease immediately. It also aids digestion and increases nutrition, making it effective in treating chronic stomach diseases such as belching, acid reflux, noisy chest tightness, loss of appetite, vomiting, stomach pain, and bloating after eating. It also has remarkable effects on intestinal diseases such as constipation, fecal impaction, diarrhea, intestinal tuberculosis, and infant vomiting of milk and green stools. Because it contains vitamin B, which is lacking in beriberi, it also has special effects in treating beriberi.</p>
<h3 id="e209">NOCTURNAL EMISSION AND SPERMATORRHEA <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Chen Shaohua</p>
<p>The cause of nocturnal emission is often hypersensitivity of the ejaculation center. If it is caused by nerve stimulation, frequent erotic dreams occur, and emission occurs during trance. There are also cases of emission that are completely unconscious, mostly due to relaxation of the seminal colliculus and vas deferens. Patients often have seminal leakage, with trickles dripping during exertion or bowel movements. However, the cause may also be leakage from the prostate gland.</p>
<p>Treatment can involve cold water friction of the perineum, avoiding stimulating conversations and erotic books, etc. Taking medicine to calm the nerves and transform sexual tissues internally can naturally achieve complete efficacy. Nai's "Essence-Nourishing Pills" have the above-mentioned effects, so they treat nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, daytime spermatorrhea, dizziness, forgetfulness, and those with bad habits of masturbation, completely eradicating them all. They are truly the most practically effective medicine for treating nocturnal emission!</p>

<p>Seven Years of Gonorrhea</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Zhou Xuzhai had gonorrhea seven years ago. Although he had been treated repeatedly, the effect was not obvious, so he has been lingering and has not been cured. Fortunately, he knows a little about health preservation, so he has not developed other sinister symptoms. However, he still feels burning pain in the urethra from time to time, has difficulty urinating, and has a lot of gonorrhea strands. He feels numb in the anus and perineum. Seminal fluid rushes out before urination, and blood is seen after defecation. This is probably a symptom of impending prostatic leakage. Later, he was introduced by a friend to Dr. Yao Juyan for treatment. After Dr. Yao performed electrotherapy and other methods, he also took the medicine "Kelinong" to eliminate inflammation, kill bacteria, promote urination, and clarify gonorrhea. After taking it for about four or five weeks, it was effective and radically cured. However, his wife had been suffering from leukorrhea for many years, and she also used "Cardo Snowdy Vaginal Tablets" externally to remove the leukorrhea and took "Kelinong" internally to clear gonorrhea. Soon she also achieved complete efficacy.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea with Physical Weakness</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Miao Nanshan was unmarried and physically weak and sickly. Later, he contracted gonorrhea, which made him even more exhausted. His gonorrhea was initially prostatitis, but later it turned into orchitis and seminal vesiculitis. Frequent nocturnal emissions, blood in the semen, and microscopic examination revealed numerous pus cells and gonococci. Mr. Miao was shocked and treated in many ways, sometimes better, sometimes worse, but the root cause became deeper. Later, he went to Dr. Dai De for treatment. After a slight operation, he was also instructed to take "Kelinong" to treat gonorrhea and "Body-Strengthening Kang" to strengthen the reproductive system tissues and treat his nocturnal emission. After more than a month, the gonorrhea was gone and the nocturnal emission was also cured. After half a year of conditioning, his physique became stronger than ever, resembling a great man. Later, Mr. Wang brokered a marriage between him and his lady, and they got married and had a son. Their couple is deeply loving.</p>
<p>Sudden Outbreak of Gonorrhea</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Huang Fengming visited brothels a month ago and contracted gonorrhea. A few days later, the urethra was both painful and itchy, gonorrhea overflowed, urination was difficult, urine was tea-green in color, the glans was red and swollen, and the foreskin could not be turned down. The pain was indescribable. Fortunately, Dr. Chen Shaohua showed him to take about three bottles of "Gulinong," which reduced gonorrhea and made urination smoother. He then felt relieved and continued to take two bottles to prevent recurrence, and he was radically cured, the urine was clear, and the pain was gone. A blood test confirmed that the root cause was eradicated.</p>
<p>Hardening and Swelling of the Testicles</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Fan Gang had suffered from gonorrhea for several years and had not been cured despite repeated treatments. Every morning, sticky and turbid fluid sealed the urethra, and the urine occasionally contained blood streaks or was turbid. The testicles were swollen, and movement was restricted and painful. Dr. Deng Yuanhe diagnosed epididymitis and prescribed "Kelinong" to eliminate gonorrhea and kill bacteria, and "Body-Strengthening Kang" was taken for endocrine treatment to eliminate testicular swelling. Within less than a month, he was completely cured.</p>

<h3 id="e211">A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE STUDY OF CI IN THE QING DYNASTY <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Sizi</p>
<p>Ci poetry is the literature of the Song Dynasty, just like poetry in the Tang Dynasty and Qu opera in the Yuan Dynasty. Ci poetry declined greatly in the Yuan and Ming Dynasties. Although there were always people writing Ci poetry, their talents were mediocre. There were no outstanding works. Because the Yuan and Ming Dynasties were right after the Song Dynasty, and Ci poetry had already developed to its peak. As the saying goes, it is difficult to continue after extreme prosperity, so naturally they could not develop it further.</p>
<p>However, in the Qing Dynasty, there was a "reversal after extreme decline," and it was extremely prosperous for a time. Literary historians call it the "revival era." Mr. Liu Zigeng has the following words in his "History of Ci Poetry":</p>
<p>"Ci poetry is the surplus of poetry, its sprout in the Sui Dynasty, its development in the Tang Dynasty, its expansion in the Five Dynasties, its flourishing in the Northern Song Dynasty, its splendor in the Southern Song Dynasty, its pruning in the Jin Dynasty, its scattering in the Ming Dynasty, its irrigation in the early Qing Dynasty, and its harvest in the Qianlong and Jiaqing period."</p>
<p>This is said in the most clear and straightforward way.</p>
<p>Now let us give a general account of the study of Ci poetry in the Qing Dynasty.</p>
<p>The Ci poets in the early Qing Dynasty could not avoid the habits of the Ming Dynasty. They all followed the Tang and Five Dynasties and took the "Among the Flowers Collection" and "Grass Hut Poetry Remnants" as models. Therefore, the Ci poetry they created was lewd, vulgar, and unsightly. When Zhu Yizun rose, he changed his style, switched to the Southern Song Dynasty, and took Jiang Baishi and Zhang Yutian as the standards, forming the later trend of "the Ci poets of Zhejiang Province all learning from Baishi and Yutian," creating the so-called "Zhe School" of Ci poetry.</p>
<p>Speaking of the "Zhe School," we should start with Cao Jiegong. Cao Rong of Jiaxing, named Jiegong, saw that the Ci poetry of the early Qing Dynasty people followed the Ming Dynasty as the law, and he was distressed by the loss of Ci poetry. Therefore, he "worshiped elegance and rejected lewdness." Zhu Yizun strongly advocated his saying, and the Zhe School was formed. Although his Ci poetry is not entirely perfect, it is quite interesting in its emptiness. As for Zhu Yizun, his talent is extremely high, so he can create his own ideas and sweep away stale words. His "Quiet Ambition Residence Qin Fun" volume is truly the best work of enchanting Ci poetry, which ordinary hands cannot hope to match.</p>
<p>At the same time as Zhu, those who belonged to the Zhe School also included Li Liangnian, Shen Haozhi, Li Fu, Shen Andeng, and Gong Xianglin. Later, there were Li E, Guo Pi, Wang Ce, and Xiang Hongzu. And Li Fanshe was the "white eyebrow" of the Zhe School, most praised by the world. Xiang Hongzu was also a strong general.</p>
<p>In addition to the Zhe School, there were Wu Weiye and Wang Shizhen in the early Qing Dynasty, both of whom were poets and Ci poets. At the same time, several great Ci poets emerged, such as Nalan Xingde and Chen Weisong. Nalan's short verses are heartbreaking and unreadable, very much like the Southern Tang emperor Li Yu. No one in the Qing Dynasty could be compared to him. Chen Weisong was as famous as Zhu Yizun, but his style was completely different, winning with his majestic and heroic spirit. He wrote more than a hundred "Manjianghong" and "Jinlvqu" verses, and his spirit can be imagined. Also, his collection of Ci poetry is the largest in volume, with a total of thirty volumes. Almost no Ci poet in ancient and modern times can match him. In addition, Cao Zhenji, Wu Qi, Gu Zhenguan, and Peng Sunyu were also masters of the time.</p>
<p>Now we have to go back to the Zhe School to talk about it. The Zhe School only praised the Southern Song Dynasty, but it strived for beautiful and elegant rhymes. By the end of its run, it was all wretched work. After Qianlong and Jiaqing, the decline became even more severe. Therefore, the Zhang Huiyan and Zhang Qi brothers rose up and revived it with the Northern Song Dynasty, respecting Zhou Bangyan and suppressing Jiang Zhang, calling themselves the Changzhou School, and parted ways with the Zhe School. Their Ci poetry developed the meaning of Ci poetry in terms of profoundness and entrustment. Dong Shishi and Zhou Ji were the driving forces behind the Changzhou School. The Ci poetry of the Changzhou School dominated the entire Ci poetry scene at that time.</p>
<p>When the Ci poetry of the Changzhou School was popular, there was a Jiang Chunlin who did not rely on any school but only followed elegance. He was rich in talent. He lived in the era of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, so his Ci poetry was pure, elegant, sad, and natural. Commentators say that he was the crown of the Qing Dynasty, which is not a false statement. In addition, Zhou Ziqi, Zhuang Yu, Tan Tingxian, and others were also skilled.</p>
<p>In the late Qing Dynasty, Wang Pengyun, Zheng Wenzhuo, Zhu Zumou, and Kuang Zhouyi were all called strong generals. Although Wang was from Guangxi, he actually inherited the system of the Changzhou School. His theory of Ci poetry separately marked the three major tenets of "importance," "clumsiness," and "greatness." His own works can indeed adhere to this goal and strive for it. When Wenzhuo wrote Ci poetry, he adhered to the rules very strictly, but the spirit of Xiao Shu and Junyi was never concealed. Zhu's Ci poetry entered "deep sorrow and resentment" from Mengchuang, and its depression and綿渺 were impossible to detect. (Chen Sanli's words) Zhou Gu's style was biased towards the sorrowful and enchanting road, which was different from Wang and Zhu.</p>
<p>The Ci poetry of the Qing Dynasty for two hundred and eighty years is roughly as described above. As for the number of Ci poets, according to the Qing Ci Zong (edited by Wang Chang, up to the early Jiaqing period), the Qing Ci Zong II (edited by Wang Shaocheng, up to Daoguang), the Qing Ci Zong Continuation (edited by Huang Xianqing, up to the end of Tongzhi), and the Qing Ci Zong Supplement (edited by Ding Shaoyi, up to the end of the Qing Dynasty), the total number is three thousand. This number cannot be considered small. The number of Ci poetry collections is of course just as many. However, these Ci poetry collections are all single volumes and isolated books, and they have never been jointly published. Therefore, if we want to study Qing Ci poetry or appreciate Qing Ci poetry, we can only rely on subjective anthologies, and it is difficult to start.</p>
<p>Now Kaiming Bookstore has printed "Famous Ci Poetry of the Qing Dynasty," collated and edited by Mr. Chen Naiqian, which cannot but be said to be a happy event. Although only a hundred families are included, there are not many omissions of important Ci poets. The Song Dynasty Ci poetry has been compiled and published by Jigu Pavilion in front, and collated and edited by Siyinzai and Qiangcun later, which is a vast spectacle, and readers find it convenient. Now that Qing Ci poetry has been published through the efforts of Mr. Chen and Kaiming Bookstore, its merit in benefiting scholars is truly immeasurable. We hope that he can continue to print the second and third collections in the future, and make a "Complete Ci Poetry of the Qing Dynasty," then how can it be just the luck of us young people!</p>
<h3 id="e212">Author's Confession of "Literary Psychology" <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Guangqian</p>
<p>This is a book that studies literary theory. I hesitated for a while about its title. It could be called "Aesthetics," because the issues it discusses generally fall within the scope of aesthetics. Aesthetics branched out from philosophy. In the past, most aestheticians had a philosophical system in mind as a basis for deducing some aesthetic principles. This book takes a different approach. It abandons all philosophical preconceptions and studies literary creation and appreciation as psychological facts, summarizing some principles applicable to literary criticism from the facts. Its subject is literary creation and appreciation, and its perspective is largely psychological, so I do not use the name "Aesthetics," but call it "Literary Psychology." Both names have been used by people in modern times, and the difference is not very large. We can say that "Literary Psychology" is "Aesthetics" studied from a psychological point of view.</p>
<p>This book was written when I was a student abroad. It was originally intended to be published earlier, so Mr. Zhu Peixian's preface was written in London in 1932. Later, I felt that some places still needed to be revised, so it was put aside for four years. During these four years, I used it as a lecture note at Tsinghua University for a year, and this year I selectively lectured on it in the "Poetry Theory" course at Peking University. Every time I lectured, I revised the original manuscript once. In terms of quantity alone, the manuscript now being printed exceeds the original manuscript that I asked Mr. Zhu Peixian to review four years ago by one-third. Chapters six, seven, eight, ten, and eleven are all newly added.</p>
<p>In these newly added five chapters, my views on aesthetics have undergone a very important change compared with when I wrote the first draft four years ago. In the past, I was bound by the formalist aesthetics passed down from Kant to Croce. I thought that aesthetic experience was purely a formal intuition. In concentration, we appreciate an isolated image without any other distractions, so abstract thinking, association, moral concepts, etc. are all outside the scope of aesthetic perception. Now, I realize that life is an organism; scientific, ethical, and aesthetic activities can be distinguished in theory, but they cannot be separated in fact, making each other isolated. Therefore, I fundamentally oppose the mechanical view on which Croce's formalist aesthetics is based, and the abstract analytical method used. I have made this change of attitude very clear in Chapter 11 – "A Critique of Croce's Aesthetics." I revised the first draft twice, both times correcting the arguments I had previously made following the formalist school from this skeptical attitude towards formalism. I dare not say that I have overthrown formalist aesthetics. Many of the principles it affirms are indelible. Its problem is that it is too biased. My contribution to it is only a "patching up of loopholes." Holding prejudices is the most misleading thing in academic research. Intentionally trying to reconcile and compromise, and intentionally being biased, are both holding prejudices. I originally had no intention of reconciling and compromising, but I finally went down the road of compromise. This may be the result of my being too cautious and not daring to easily believe in one-sided theories and one-sided facts.</p>
<p>Now, people in general seem to still have an inappropriate contempt for the study of literary theory. Creators say, "I can create without your literary theories; you still can't create even with those literary theories." Appreciators say, "The beauty and mystery of literature and art cannot be analyzed by scientific methods. If you analyze it by scientific methods, the result is to 'break the seven-jeweled building into pieces.'" These words are indeed "well-founded and reasonable," but those who study literary theory do not necessarily have to eliminate their right to exist because of this. He can defend himself as follows:</p>
<p>Everything has research value. Science does not divide worldly things into two types: "should be studied" and "should not be studied." Unless you are deliberately ignorant, unless you force others to follow you in being deliberately ignorant, literary creators and appreciators have no reason to despise others for engaging in scientific activities in literature and art, that is, seeking principles about literature and art based on the facts of creation and appreciation.</p>
<p>There are only two reasons why a person studies a subject: one is that the subject has direct practical use for him, like child psychology for educators; the other is that although it has no direct practical use, its problems easily arouse curiosity, and people want to study it, just like children want to drill into a maze to find a way out, simply because the matter itself is interesting. Regarding the study of literary theory, even if we step back and admit that it has no practical use for creation and appreciation, we cannot just write it off. Since it has problems, it can stimulate curiosity and arouse research interest.</p>
<p>Moreover, is the study of literary theory not useful for creation and appreciation at all? First, in terms of creation, while it is true that those with "high eyes" may have "low hands," it seems that there are not many with "low eyes" and "high hands." Literature and art in modern times have largely departed from "natural expression" and entered the stage of "intentional depiction," that is, it has become a "self-conscious" activity. Every artist sooner or later will have to think about content and form, art and life, freehand and realism, and other issues. What he personally experiences in practice, such as Leonardo da Vinci's "Treatise on Painting," Goethe and Eckermann's "Conversations," Rodin's "Art," and Flaubert's "Letters," are certainly very valuable, but every artist does not necessarily have the time and interest, especially not necessarily the calm analytical ability, to build a theory. If he pays a little attention to the results obtained by those who study literary theory, he may not hold biased, or even wrong, views on the problems he usually thinks about himself. In literature and art, the bad effects of wrong views are no less than those of inferior skills.</p>
<p>Speaking of appreciation, the study of literary theory is simply indispensable. Since it is called appreciation, one must understand the criteria of "value" and the essence of art. If you have not decided what is beautiful, you have no reason to say that this painting is more beautiful than that painting; if you do not understand the essence of art, you have no reason to say that this work is art and that work is not art. There are indeed many people in the world who criticize literature and art without studying aesthetics, but they are like sailors talking about astronomy and nurses talking about medicine, relying entirely on crude experience without a rigorous and systematic theory as a basis. I dare not ignore crude experience, but I dare say that it is not enough, and sometimes it is misleading.</p>
<p>Taking this opportunity, I may as well briefly talk about my personal experience. I never dreamed that one day I would go down the road of aesthetics. I have been a student at several universities for fourteen years, studying many irrelevant subjects, dissecting sharks, making stained sections, reading architectural history, learning symbolic nomenclature, and using smoked drums and electrical reaction tables to test psychological reactions, but I have never taken an aesthetics class. My original center of interest was first literature, then psychology, and third philosophy. Because I liked literature, I was forced to study the standards of criticism, art and life, art and nature, content and form, language and thought; because I liked psychology, I was forced to study the relationship between imagination and emotion, the psychological activities of creation and appreciation, and the individual differences in taste; because I liked philosophy, I was forced to study the works of Kant, Hegel, and Croce on aesthetics. In this way, aesthetics has become the connecting thread of the several subjects I like. I now believe that it is a great lack if people who study literature, art, psychology, and philosophy ignore aesthetics.</p>
<p>The book includes three articles on "Modern Experimental Aesthetics," which briefly describe the paths taken by modern psychologists in doing aesthetic experiments, the methods used, and the results obtained. These are all dry facts, but I believe that the most important training for scientists is to learn to value dry facts and find interest in dry facts, so these three articles may be helpful to literary psychologists.</p>
<p>This book generally discusses literature and art. I have written another book, "Poetics," which applies the basic principles of this book to discuss the problems of poetry. At the same time, it conducts a theoretical study of Chinese poetry.</p>
<p>The completion of this book relies on the help of many friends. The first is Mr. Zhu Peixian. He carefully reviewed the original manuscript for me in his hurried journey in Europe, wrote a preface, and gave me many careful criticisms. Chapter 6, "Aesthetic Feeling and Association," was revised because he was not satisfied with the original manuscript. The second is Mr. Xia Gaizun. He allowed this relatively specialized book to have the opportunity to be published in this year of book industry depression. Finally, it is my wife, Jin Wu. She gave me much encouragement when this book was drafted, and then painstakingly corrected the mistakes again and again after the manuscript was completed. Taking this opportunity, I would like to express my gratitude to them.</p>
<h3 id="e213">"A Story of Human History" <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Qingshui</p>
<p>We know very well that children like to read books about past lives and stories. Because history separates people for too long, the imagination, wisdom, skills, and tools used by people before were all hundreds or thousands of times clumsier than those of today. Therefore, their process of surviving and struggling was so strange and bizarre. When we see it, we not only feel some horror, but also laugh so hard that our stomachs hurt, and exclaim "Stupid people, stupid people!" However, this is an unavoidable mistake caused by the various environments of our ancestors' limitations in era, knowledge, and tools, and it is not that their wisdom is not as good as ours. In this historical process, we really need to deeply understand and strive for. Not only do we need to know what is so, but also what must be so.</p>
<p>This subject, this kind of    , also existed in the past, but some said it was too bizarre, and completely mythologized it, which made children feel insufficient. Some were written too plainly, describing it realistically, preaching with a straight face, obscure and difficult to understand, simply unable to be read, and falling asleep after listening. Therefore, the impression that this subject and this knowledge have on the minds of any of our children is so vague that as soon as they leave the school gate, they forget it cleanly and completely return it to the teacher.</p>
<p>This book, "A Story of Human History" (The Child’s Story of the Human Race) by Ramon Koffman, is a rare good book. It is very suitable for adults to read, and it goes without saying that it is most beneficial for children to read. "Insect Stories" is a good book, but its content is limited to a certain aspect. "The Wind in the Willows" is a good book, but its material is not so extensive. Even "The Story of Mankind" by Van Loon, which everyone knows and reads, has less and fresher material than this book. This book uses artistic means and simple and clear language to write a very interesting book that is easy to read and enjoyable to read about the ancient life history of mankind. It is neither a fictitious myth, which makes readers unconsciously pursue the paradise of illusory poetry; nor is it a flat and straightforward account book writing, like a dead snake, but rather an undulating and winding method of peeling bananas and drawing silk, analyzing it layer by layer, clarifying the progress of the history of ancient human life, so that readers can satisfactorily understand the important question of "why is it so" that they cannot understand. This is true history, history that meets scientific requirements, which is most sufficient for us to understand the past and present state and process of people, as well as all the interconnected historical relationships. Divided into sections and paragraphs, arranged in an orderly manner, like flowing water connected into one, equally simple, equally clear, equally tortuous and beautiful narrative, like a myth story that is easy to recite and read, it is truly appropriate to say that it is a rare book.</p>
<p>When "Children's Day" came, I wrote articles for several newspapers, all talking about such a question. I said, "More fairy tale books that explain the meaning of human history and natural phenomena should be compiled, printed, or translated with beautiful words for our children to read." "This year, children's literature is almost dying. If we cannot create good fairy tales for children to read, then translating some excellent works for children to read, such as the ones that Benkakko gives to children of the 20th century, is also a work of great merit." (Mr. Zhou Zuoren seems to have said something like this) The editor spent three years to compile this good book that is sufficient to satisfy children's intellectual desires; the Japanese scholar Torii Ryuzo praised it as "not only can it be used as a children's book; it is also very valuable as a general reading material" (translator's preface). This statement is the most fair. The advertisement for "The Wind in the Willows" says, "This is a book for young people, so it may be exclusively for young people, as well as people who still have a young spirit alive in their hearts. This is life, sunlight, flowing water, trees, dusty roads, and the warmth of the fireside in winter. It is comparable to 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland' and becomes a classic." After reading this book, I admired the book's light, beautiful, and witty writing—especially the first two or three chapters are beautifully written, unprecedented—and thought that it would be fitting and appropriate to move this passage to give to each other as a gift.</p>
<p>The author's original preface says: "I wrote this book happily. If you read it and get the same happiness, it is my fortune." Dear young people! Please accept the words of "your good friend" and read in one breath such a good book he wrote for you that is full of life and content and can be used as spiritual food!</p>

<h3 id="e214">After Installing a Telephone <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Jì Guān</p>
<p>Points to Note for Users</p>
<p>The benefits of telephones are well known to ordinary people. Once installed, they can be connected at any time. Whether near or far, both parties can talk as if they were face to face. The United States is the most developed country in terms of telephones. Its people regard the use of telephones as a necessity in daily life. Although my country's progress is slow, in recent years, the development of the telephone industry has also been increasing day by day, which shows a glimpse of the society's willingness to use it.</p>
<p>After the telephone is installed, making calls is naturally not a problem, but users should also understand that to maintain calls and make quick calls with this telephone, they should usually pay attention to it. Although this is common knowledge, it seems worth discussing.</p>
<p>(A) When installing a telephone, a deposit must be paid. This deposit is equivalent to the price of the machine. If it is not used and removed in the future, the telephone company will naturally have to return the full amount. However, users must know that the telephone is the property of the telephone company. During the period of use, it is also the property of the user. Usually, they should pay attention to protecting the machine parts to avoid losses and compensation.</p>
<p>(B) Whether the telephone is installed indoors on a desk or hung high on the wall, the new machine is beautiful in style and can be used as a decoration even if it is a tool. However, after being used for a long time, it gradually becomes dirty and damaged, and even the machine cord is knotted and the magnetic paint is peeling off. It is the user's fault to let it go naturally without cherishing it. Therefore, users should clean and wipe their telephones at any time (with a dry cloth or broom) so that they can last for a long time without breaking.</p>
<p>(C) Dampness and moisture are most easily absorbed into the telephone cord, affecting the call. Therefore, wet cloths, towels, and damp objects must not be placed on the telephone at will to avoid affecting the use.</p>
<p>(D) If you need to personally call someone to talk after receiving a call, you cannot hang up the receiver at this time. If it is a desk phone, it can be placed on the desk without any problem. If it is a wall phone, there is no way to hang it up in a hurry. Often, the receiver is allowed to drop and hang directly next to the machine. If this is done repeatedly, the telephone cord is very easily damaged. If a hook or hanger is pre-installed, this problem can be avoided. (The edge of the cover plate of the magneto telephone can be used to temporarily hang the receiver, but it is also quite easy to slip off.)</p>
<p>(E) The telephone number of this machine, if it is an automatic telephone, is clearly marked on the central round piece on the dial. It is clear at a glance. However, the magneto or common battery telephone lacks it. It is best for the user to write it himself and stick it on the machine so that when making a call or if someone asks about the number of this machine, or if they want him to call back, they can temporarily forget it without having to look it up.</p>
<p>(F) Users who often need to make calls should make a list of their telephone numbers and hang it next to the machine so that they can get it at a glance. The telephone numbers of the fire brigade and the police station in charge should also be included in it to prevent problems before they occur and to feel more convenient in an emergency.</p>
<p>(G) If the telephone is not working, the telephone company will send a worker to repair it, or if the rental fee is due, the telephone company will send a staff member to collect it. Those who enter and leave the user's house wear symbols or badges. If there is any doubt, they can be proven. To prevent the mingling of petty thieves, users should also pay sufficient attention to this point.</p>
<p>(H) Users who use magneto or common battery telephones may think that the operators are not serving well (such as being rude and scolding, etc.) or that the connection is delayed. If it is true, you do not have to argue with each other on the machine and have a quarrel. You should report the real situation and the date and time of the call to the telephone company. The telephone company can check it out immediately and punish the operators according to the rules.</p>
<p>When installing a telephone, the telephone company will do its best to provide common convenience for making calls. On the user's side, it is nothing more than hoping that the telephone can always be kept in good condition without having to be repaired from time to time. However, since the telephone is installed in someone's home, this part of the machine is entirely up to the user to maintain and cherish it. Using it well can also increase the speed of calls and reduce unnecessary troubles. This is actually beneficial to both parties. I hope that those who install the machine will pay attention to it.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Giving Gifts by Telegram <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Yǒulǐ</p>
<p>Giving gifts by telegram, the telegram arrives, and the gift certificate also arrives. The delivery boy is polite, and also serves as a gift messenger. However, according to the usual custom, the messenger's tip ranges from a few cents to several yuan depending on the thickness of the gift. The delivery boy who acts as a gift messenger must absolutely not ask for or accept it.</p>
<p>In the past, social telegrams could only send congratulatory or condolence messages. The recipient of such a telegram knew that relatives and friends in the distance were expressing deep sympathy for their weddings, funerals, or celebrations. In terms of etiquette, it was only to express their heart. However, in social customs, internal expression is certainly important, but the gift of material things cannot be avoided. Since there is gift-giving by telegram, the heart and the gift actually arrive, and the recipient receives considerable comfort in both spirit and matter. Increasing the friendship between the two parties, this method is really thoughtful.</p>
<p>Speaking of giving gifts, I personally feel that it is a troublesome thing, especially when sending them to a distance? After opening a draft through the post office or bank, you still need to write a letter yourself for congratulations or condolences and send the draft together by registered mail. This letter for giving gifts, whether it should use "a hundred years of harmony" or "condolences on your loss," I, who am frugal, often feel that it is "quite troublesome." Now, you only need to hand the gift money to the telegraph office and send a simple telegram. The telegraph office also has ready-made words for the telegram, which you can choose and use at your discretion. The cost of the telegram is limited, and the trouble saved is a lot. I dare to say that everyone feels convenient.</p>
<p>People who are handling weddings, funerals, and celebrations! Don't think that your relatives or friends are far away and may not have time to give gifts or have forgotten to give gifts. You must know that giving gifts by telegram is especially fast. It can be delivered as scheduled on the day it is sent. Wait until the delivery boy enters the door to believe that your relatives and friends are generous and affectionate, not only have they not lost etiquette, but the gift they have given is a gift certificate that is formal and can be cashed immediately! Etiquette is about reciprocity, and you can certainly praise it as "the best in social interaction."</p>
<h3 id="e216">Various Improvements Regarding Radio Broadcasting Stations <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, radio broadcasting in our country has gradually aroused the interest of the general public, and the installation of radios has also been increasing day by day. It is reported that the Ministry of Communications issued 42,565 radio licenses by the end of last year, and 53,634 licenses by mid-June of this year, an increase of 11,069 over the end of last year. If this number is compared with Japan and the United States, it is certainly far behind, but it is also a very good phenomenon in my country's initial stage. Moreover, in fact, this number is definitely less than the actual number, because there are many cases where those who install machines have not registered, and this is probably an inevitable stage.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications recently felt that the power of the Shanghai and Beiping broadcasting stations run by the ministry was very small, which was not enough to give full play to their effectiveness. It is now reported that it has been decided to change the original 200-watt station in Shanghai to 2,000 watts, and the original 200-watt station in Beiping to 1,000 watts. All renovation plans have been ordered to be decided by the respective stations and submitted to the Ministry for review. It is expected that this renovation will be implemented soon. It is also reported that it will actively improve the broadcasting program, especially the educational program, and strive to enrich it, such as hiring celebrities to give lectures and teaching various sciences to increase the common sense of general listeners.</p>
<p>The World Games are scheduled to be held in Berlin, Germany on August 1. The athletes participating in our country are all outstanding figures. In order to promote sports, the Ministry of Communications has decided to receive the above sports news from the International Radio Station's Liuhang Receiving Station, and then connect it to the Central Broadcasting Station via long-distance telephone lines for national broadcasting.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications reported that the Jiuda Broadcasting Station in Suzhou increased its power privately, and even broadcast Cantonese music during the period of suspension of entertainment due to the death of Chairman Hu Zhan, and has sent personnel to investigate and confirm it. It has been punished by suspending broadcasting for two weeks as a warning.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Measures of the Ministry of Communications to Maintain Long-Distance Telephone Lines <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>In order to increase the efficiency of repairing telecommunication line obstacles, the Ministry of Communications stipulated the method of repairing telecommunication line obstacles in September last year. All lines under the jurisdiction of various bureaus and offices should be paid attention to by engineers, business directors, testers, branch chiefs, or business personnel at any time. If obvious anomalies occur, the internal and external lines should be inspected separately. If it is found that the obstacle occurs outside the bureau, a work order should be issued immediately to order the workers to rush to investigate and repair it as soon as possible without any delay. As for the time for line workers to repair line obstacles, except for very serious disasters that cannot be repaired due to insufficient manpower, the time of blocking the money, day or night, must not exceed the following regulations: (1) Important lines, 24 hours: (2) Secondary and ordinary lines, 30 hours. Since then, the rate of repairing money obstacles has increased a lot.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of this spring, long-distance telephone line projects in various provinces have been gradually completed and opened for business, which is very important for communication in all aspects. It is urgently necessary to maintain it conscientiously. If the lines occasionally lose their balance, there will be problems such as induced noise. It is difficult to hear clearly when talking. Therefore, the method of repairing the electric money line should be paid attention to carefully and should not be slackened.</p>
<p>In addition, the cross positions and methods of each telephone line have been properly configured, and no changes are allowed. Drawings should be drawn immediately to instruct the workers in charge of the section to be familiar with the number of pairs of telephone lines under their jurisdiction and the cross position method to avoid errors. When the Qian workers test the money, they must conduct it on a money testing pole equipped with a money testing clip. After the test is completed, the money testing clip must be wiped clean, connected properly, and tightened. Do not cut off the lines arbitrarily. Furthermore, the Ministry of Communications has long stipulated the entrance of each long-distance telephone line into the bureau and office. The other intermediate bureaus must not arbitrarily cut off the line to introduce it, or connect other single money to prevent hindering the call.</p>
<p>The above measures have been ordered to be followed by the various electrical administration bureaus.</p>

<p>It has been observed that many of the ship radio stations installed on Chinese merchant ships are poorly equipped and maintained, resulting in low communication efficiency, which greatly affects navigation safety. It is heard that the Ministry of Communications, in order to improve the communication efficiency of various ship radio stations, has stipulated the following organizational measures:</p>
<p>(1) When Chinese merchant ships equipped with ship radio stations arrive in Shanghai, the captain or their agent shall immediately submit a written report to the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau, which shall notify the Shanghai International Radio Station to dispatch engineers or technicians for inspection.</p>
<p>(2) When technicians from the International Radio Station inspect ship radio stations, they should pay attention to the following points: 1. Whether the transmitting and receiving equipment is well maintained; 2. Whether the power supply equipment is appropriate; 3. Whether the frequency of the transmitter is accurate; 4. Whether the antenna method, height, and length are appropriate; 5. Whether there are spare transmitters and receivers and automatic alarm machines; 6. Whether the batteries are well maintained; 7. Whether the location and equipment of the radio room are appropriate; 8. Whether the radio station and radio operators have licenses; whether the radio operators' skills are excellent; how many radio operators are there in total; 9. Whether the wireless compass is accurate; 10. Other matters related to communication efficiency.</p>
<p>(3) After completing the inspection, the inspectors from the International Radio Station shall immediately fill out four copies of the inspection report: one copy shall be submitted to the Ministry of Communications for verification, one copy shall be sent to the Maritime Affairs Bureau for review, one copy shall be given to the ship captain or their agent for reference, and one copy shall be kept at the station.</p>
<p>(4) If the inspection report contains any deficiencies in the equipment of the ship radio station, the Maritime Affairs Bureau shall urge the ship to promptly organize and improve it.</p>
<p>(5) After the ship radio station has been organized and improved, a written report shall be immediately submitted to the Maritime Affairs Bureau, which shall notify the International Radio Station to send personnel for re-inspection. If any deficiencies are still found, the provisions of Article 4 shall be followed.</p>

<h3 id="e220">Question and Answer Column <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>This publication has specially opened a question and answer column. Members of the public who have questions regarding the procedures for sending and receiving telegrams and telephones, or who are unclear about telecommunications regulations, or who have any inquiries about telecommunications knowledge, are welcome to contact us. We will answer them sincerely.</p>
<p>(1) Mr. Liu Ziqi of Changsha asks: Now that the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Communications have issued orders to implement cash collection for government and military telegrams, should this be followed? However, can the name and address of the recipient be calculated as three characters if they are less than thirteen characters, as with ordinary telegrams?</p>
<p>(Answer) According to the provisions of Article 83 of the General Rules for Domestic Telegram Business, the recipient's address and name for government and military telegrams shall be charged according to the original number of characters. The cost per character of a telegram is consistently above one dime, and the telegraph bureau has already lost half of the fee by halving the fees for government and military telegrams. Therefore, the recipient's address and name are not treated in the same way as ordinary telegrams.</p>
<p>(2) Mr. Liu Chucai of Nanjing asks: I am currently planning to make a long-distance call from Nanjing to a friend in Jiujiang to discuss a certain important matter, and pay at half price according to the government and military telegram rate. Is this possible?</p>
<p>(Answer) According to the General Rules for Long-Distance Telephone Business, there are no provisions for half-price charges. Moreover, the Nanjing-Jiujiang long-distance telephone line is one of the main lines of the long-distance telephone network of nine provinces. The capital for this telephone line project is a loan from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund to the Ministry of Communications. According to the contract, all telephone revenue is the primary guarantee. Tolls must be paid according to regulations, and there is no room for flexibility. It is also heard that the Executive Yuan has issued orders to various political and military agencies to maintain it.</p>
<p>Correction: In the previous issue of this publication, in the article "Completion of the Nanjing-Hankou Trunk Line of the Nine-Province Long-Distance Telephone Network," Nanjing to Huaining and Nanjing to Wuhu, Hankou to Jiujiang and Huaining to Jiujiang are all direct, which was incorrectly published as "via Jiujiang." This is hereby corrected.</p>

<h3 id="e221">Statistics on Accidental Events <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Lian</p>
<p>According to the China Daily: "In May of this year, 171 accidental events occurred in the Public Concession due to industrial and occupational reasons, which were reported to the Municipal Council. Among them, 8 were fatal, 8 women were injured, and 1 was fatal. The causes of the accidental events were known in 161 cases. The Municipal Council investigated and ordered the adoption of preventive measures in 107 cases." In this alarming number, the occupations of the deceased and injured are statistically divided, and workers in the metal and machinery industries account for the largest number, with a total of 60 deaths and injuries. There were 27 deaths and injuries among construction workers, 16 deaths and injuries among textile workers, 21 deaths and injuries among transport workers, and 15 deaths and injuries among papermaking and printing workers. … According to an examination of the causes of death and injury, 13 accidental events occurred in gears or belts, 51 occurred in power machines, 11 occurred in pressure machines, and 11 occurred in rolling mills. … And these statistics on accidental events are only within May, and only belong to one corner of the Shanghai Public Concession, and the number is already so alarming. If we extrapolate proportionally, the seriousness can be imagined.</p>
<p>We really cannot ignore these accidental events. From the causes of the accidents, we can at least be sure that the methods of preventing accidents are not very sound, which makes the safety of workers lose its guarantee, and they have to reluctantly do it because they are driven by life. This has led to an increase in the number of accidental events, which is indeed a cruel human tragedy.</p>
<p>From the standpoint of humanity and justice, we cannot remain silent about the protection of workers' lives. Although we also know that in this turbulent era, even if we make improvements, it is still not a thorough solution. We think that sometimes even if we can slightly reduce the severity, it is not unhelpful to make small improvements first.</p>
<p>The suffering of Chinese workers' lives is already greater than that of European and American countries, and the lack of protection of their lives is even more unbearable for people with a sense of humanity and justice. Now, according to the Municipal Council's statistics for May, the number of workers who are frequently injured or killed in accidents is still so large. Then, those who have not been published and those who have not been investigated and counted should be more than this number. Therefore, for the sake of the future of Chinese workers, it is necessary to appeal to the public again and again.</p>
<h3 id="e222">A Tour of Allen Goat Milk Farm <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Zhou</p>
<p>Special Report from this Newspaper</p>
<p>Goat milk farms in our country can be said to be an emerging industry; because its discovery was only a year ago. And I only knew that there was a goat milk company on Jiangwan Road in Shanghai at first. Until recently, I went to Zhenru twice, and I realized that there was also an Allen Goat Milk Farm there.</p>
<p>But Chinese people are still very unfamiliar with goat milk, and they don't understand what the difference is between its quality and cow milk, so very few people eat it, and it is difficult to promote it widely for a while. —— The goat milk business in Europe, America, and Japan is almost as developed as the cow milk industry; especially in Sweden, goat milk farms have almost become an important sideline in the countryside. So I always wanted to visit there, and I also wanted to introduce some of the situation inside to the readers in our country who are concerned about the production industry.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, that public bus took me from Baoshan Road to the front of Jinan University in Zhenru; I braved the dust that was rolled up into the air by the bus and walked along that cinder road. On the bridge block, I saw the signposts for Allen Goat Milk Farm and the Zhenru Rural Education Experimental Zone; following the direction of the signposts across the bridge, it was the wide and flat Zhenru Road.</p>
<p>After passing Zhenru Middle School, both sides were full of fields. The melon vines and bean vines in the fields, and the bean pods and cotton seedlings, were all crouching under the scorching sun in a lovely green color. Some flowers were hiding on the green leaves like butterflies. Although there are also a few villa-style foreign houses and a few small plantations or flower gardens along the road, they are as sparse as morning stars.</p>
<p>Some cotton fields have black signs that say "Zhenru Rural Education Experimental Zone Cotton Demonstration Farm," which are special fields for agricultural improvement experiments.</p>
<p>Allen Goat Milk Farm is about a mile away from Zhenru Railway Station and covers an area of ten acres. It is surrounded by bamboo fences. Next to it is a farm office, and opposite it is the general office of the Zhenru Rural Education Experimental Zone.</p>
<p>I went inside, found the office, explained my intention to a female clerk, and she sent a manager to guide me through the visit.</p>
<p>First, I visited the milk bottle disinfection room; there is a bottle washing machine there. All empty bottles prepared for filling milk must first be washed on this machine and then placed in a steam box for disinfection. This kind of steam box is installed in the wall. Each box is divided into six drawers, and each drawer can hold 60 empty bottles. There are six complete steam boxes, and each box is equipped with a thermometer. After putting the washed empty bottles in the box, the door must be closed, and at the same time, the steam in this box is released. The average temperature of the steam is 200 to 220 degrees. —— And this box has doors on both sides, one side is in the bottle washing room, and the other side is in the bottle filling room. When disinfecting, it is put in from here, and when filling milk, it is taken out from there. The procedure can be said to be very convenient.</p>
<p>The milking room is in the back; there are also two rooms here, one is for washing the sheep before milking; after washing the sheep, they are milked in that room. Milking is done manually; they ride the sheep on a wooden frame, and people sit under its belly and slowly squeeze the milk out. After the milk is squeezed out, it must be sent upstairs to the steam pot for disinfection immediately. In addition to a very large steam pot, there is also a circular thermometer on the wall, like a wall clock, and the temperature required for steaming milk is about 140 to 150 degrees. Walking down the cement stairs next to it is the bottle filling room. There is a bottle filling machine here. Above the bottle filling machine is a refrigeration machine. One end of the machine is connected to the milk steaming pot through a pipe, and the other end is connected to the funnel of the bottle filling machine. On the wall is the steam box door for milk bottle disinfection. Behind is a cold room. After the goat milk is filled into bottles, it is stored in the cold room.</p>
<p>After visiting these places, we went to visit the sheep pen; there are two houses in the sheep pen. Each house has two rows of iron railings and two troughs. Each sheep lives separately and cannot compete for food or invade territory. And the house must be washed once every day, so it is very clean; and they must be grazed in the outside garden once every day.</p>
<p>The capital for the opening of the farm is 100,000 yuan, and there are currently more than 200 sheep. These sheep are all Swedish breeds, and each one is worth about 80 yuan. On average, one sheep can be milked twice a day, at least 8 pounds. If no accidents occur, one sheep can produce milk for three years. After three years, it will not be able to produce milk. The udders of these sheep are very large, and they look a bit like the udders of cows.</p>
<p>Their feed is similar to that of sheep, consisting of soybeans, wheat, soybean cakes, and grass, etc., but their wool and meat are insufficient for use in addition to producing milk.</p>
<p>As for the difference between goat milk and cow milk, goat milk has less T.B, but other proteins and vitamins are the same, and goat milk is better than cow milk, because cow milk is hot in nature and is not suitable for people who are sick or weak or have stomach problems. Goat milk is very beneficial to people with stomach problems, and it does not matter whether it is cold or warm in season.</p>
<p>In terms of price, there is not much difference between goat milk and cow milk.</p>
<p>However, it is necessary to manage these sheep well, such as the cleanliness of the houses, the circulation of air, and the prevention of diseases, all of which require strict equipment. Otherwise, there is inevitably a danger of death and infection from time to time!</p>
<p>It has only been open for more than a year now, but it is said that the results are very good, and the sales of milk are not bad, but these sales are all in Shanghai, and there are very few elsewhere.</p>
<p>Finally, I toured all parts of the farm; there. In addition to the sheep pen and the various parts of the bottle filling area, there is also an office, a relay office, a self-flowing well motor room and a water storage pavilion, a cement room, and a thatched pavilion on the lawn in front. Moreover, this place is full of rural flavor. Not only is the environment quiet, the air is fresh, and the scenery is even more beautiful, but the transportation is also very convenient, so I think this location is really too good.</p>

<p>— Zhi Min</p>
<p>Mrs. Zhu seemed to be angry with someone. I already heard the sound of high-heeled leather shoes when she entered the door. Today is the wedding of one of her classmates. A week ago, she prepared diligently for herself and her husband, and she was very happy to have such an opportunity to boast to her many classmates that her husband was such an honest and handsome man. But it happened to be the time for the bank's closing accounts, and she couldn't ask for leave in the bank. Mr. Zhu loved his wife very much. He knew that his wife's efforts for the week had been in vain, so he said to his wife apologetically the next evening:</p>
<p>"There's nothing I can do about it. After eating other people's food, I can't ask for leave during these two periods of the year; but I'll try to get out earlier and have dinner there, wouldn't that be the same?"</p>
<p>But when Mr. Zhu came out of the bank today, it was already ten o'clock in the evening. He expected that the guests would be leaving soon.</p>
<p>Mrs. Zhu felt that it was an insult, and an insult to her husband. But when she told those classmates,</p>
