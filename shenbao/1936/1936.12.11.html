<p>時評</p>
<h3>英國皇位問題</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>在動搖不安的世界裏。大英帝國是最大的安定勢力。在　大的大英帝　。皇室又是唯一的維繫物。很不幸的。近年以來。大英帝國在世界的領導力。漸漸降低。而更不幸的。在大英帝國最需要團結的現在。爲了英皇的婚事問題。皇室的威望。未免動搖。英國人民的團結。大英帝國各部的聯絡。有趨於脆弱之勢。我們不應把這個個人婚姻問題。僅僅作風流佳話來談。因爲此事影響所及。不僅限於英國一隅。而有關於全世、界之休戚。</p>
<p>英皇在英國實際政治上。表面看來是毫無權力。無足重輕的。因爲習慣憲法所賦給皇帝的大權。差不多全要由內閣行使。而內閣又是對國會負責。間接便是對全國人民負責的。但是把英皇看作法蘇各國大總統一樣。頗有錯誤的。因爲英皇有他崇高的重要的機能和作用。而這種機能作用。都不許愛德華八世自由地娶離婚過兩度的美國艷婦爲后的。第一。英皇代表着統一的國家。是國家的唯一代表人。首相雖然實際負行政大權。但他是黨派的領　。他的任期不定。他在全國人民心目中沒。有固定的印象和帶有宗敎意味的愛戴。在國家危急之際。要國王出來。排難解紛。一九三一年前皇喬治不顧憲法成規。任麥克唐納組織全國一致內閣。卽其明例。</p>
<p>第二。英皇是英國海陸空軍的最高長官。每個英國軍人。入伍之時。便要發誓效忠英皇。這雖然是一種形式。不是實權。可是英皇是國家的徽號。是將士們忠勇的寄託點。沒有這個重心。或者將士們對於這個偶像的信心發生動搖。對於軍隊的志氣。會發生極大影響的。第三。英皇夫婦是英國社會的最高榜樣。也是世界最高榮譽的表率。因爲他們受世界的最大尊敬。所以在國內政治上同國際政治。都能發揮很大效力。尤其是對於榮譽觀念很深的國家。如果得英皇之一度降臨。便威覺到莫大的榮幸。英國的風俗習慣。道德標準都用英皇英后做榜樣的。移風改俗。效力速而且大。已往英國報紙。利用近代的攝影術及新聞記者的生花妙筆。把英皇英后。在民衆的心中。造成全知全能盡美盡善的想像。現在英國民衆發現了他們最鄙視的離過婚的美國婦人　做他們的皇后。這當然是一個極大的失望。</p>
<p>但是英皇最重要的任務。還在於維繫大英帝國全部的團結。英帝國各自治領十在事實上已經等於獨立。倫敦國會的法律。不能支配加拿大澳洲。這個包括許多民族許多宗敎許多不同政體的帝國。唯一的維繫物。便是全帝國人民。都臣服於英皇。向英皇効忠。所以英國人稱皇室爲「帝國之黃金鎖鏈」近年以來。加拿大澳洲南菲新錫蘭等國自治的程度。日益提高。同英國的利害漸有不一致的地方。他們有他們的外交官。有他們的海陸軍。也有他們的國會政府。但是他們對於皇室的動忠。却日益加甚。每决皇家的人到各自治領去受當地人民熱烈的歡迎。高呼着吾皇萬歲。英國有一個皇帝。眞是維繫帝國的最可寳貴工具。任何政治學家。决想不出有一種更好的制度。使分佈於五大洲的英國人民及屬地。在一個重心上團結起來。然而帝國各部。决不願意他們奉爲神聖的皇后。是美國二度離婚的女子。而且這個女子的兩位的前夫。尙在人世。所以目前自治　代表。對婚事積極反對。就常情而論。他們反對也不是毫無理由的。</p>
<p>所以愛德華八世和辛博生夫人的婚事。不是個人問題。也不是英國局部問題。而有關於英帝國團結與瓦解的問題。也有關於世界和平安定勢力之增加或咸低的問題。據史家研究。在歐洲大戰以前。奧太子菲蝶南不顧皇室反對。娶地位低微的沙菲霍德爲妻。這件事同歐洲大戰。有相當的因果關係。因婦女之故而使國際政治發生變化。中外歷史。代有明例。此次英皇與辛博生夫人的婚姻問題。確不可以等閒視之。據最近消息。英皇已宣布遜位。這種英斷是有益於英國前途的。</p>

<p>昨賽情形</p>
<p>足球</p>
<p>昨日足球三塲、均屬初賽、角逐結果、約翰晏成之江三校、晋達複賽週、今日開始複賽、同時被淘汰之滬江桃塢及明强三校、亦開始競奪亞軍、至上屆冠軍金陸隊、初賽適逢輪空、今日將與之江遇於複賽、如之江獲勝、則金陵將與明强作落選賽、否則之江巳無資格與明强重逢、而明强亦將不勞而入落選賽之複賽週、但今日金陵之勝望絕濃、對錦標亦極目把握約翰亦雄心勃勃、且得地利之宜、將來冠亞兩軍、將為此兩隊所必爭也、昨日、三塲結果如后、</p>
<p>約翰勝滬江　八對一</p>
<p>晏成勝桃塢　三對一</p>
<p>之江勝明强　四對二</p>
<p>籃球</p>
<p>籃球賽昨共六塲、故各校均巳出席兩次、而完畢其全程九分之二、各隊實力、當以之江較弱、明强技術尙是、而缺乏經騐、東吳亦平平、最佳者當推滬江約翰與金陵三隊、金陸究為上屆、雙料冠軍、雖昨日兩戰兩敗但所遇者為滬江與約翰兩强、共缺乏者為守、前鋒之兩郭一蔣、投擲均極準確、傳遞亦極銳利、其敗於滬江、則因守之不不如人、敗於約翰、則在謀之及、當金陸與約翰相逢時、金陸着着前導、上半時尙以十九比十四領先、中途之最大差數、會有八分之多、詛冉戰時銳於進取、未顧後防致連負十二分之多、迨及覺悟、則約翰勝算早操、最擅投籃之中鋒郭兆英、已為的翰所嚴密監視、欲射無從、致反勝為敗、約翰後衛沈繼恩能鑽能射、昨賽中厥功最偉、將來不難為許文奎之第二、惟全隊經騐、似亦未屆純淸之候、當三十九比二十八時、距終塲僅四分鐘、勝利在握、當事嚴守、但仍銳意進取、致為金陵左右兩鋒、增上八分之多、幾為所乘、此賽因為錦標關係、雙方啦啦隊大事活躍、各為其屬隊助威、事無獨有偶、明强敗於東吳一役、與金陵同出一輒、明强於上半時以十六比六赫然前導、此後防守疏忽、反以二十二比二十五敗續、現各校形勢、滬江與約翰各以兩戰兩勝並峙、東吳與明强、各一勝一負、金陵與之江、則各兩戰兩敗、但預測今後逢東吳與明時强、金陵勝望極濃云、</p>
<p>明强勝之江　卅八比十九</p>
<p>約翰勝東吳　四五比十八</p>
<p>滬江勝金陵　四二比卅一</p>
<p>滬江勝之江　四五比廿一</p>
<p>東吳勝明强　廿五比廿二</p>
<p>約翰勝金陵　四三比卅六</p>
<h3>西靑籃球　約翰戰勝滬江　靑光延長時間勝黃蜂　今晚辛隊出戰麥令甲</h3>
<p>西靑籃球昨晚因秩序互調、而臨時又因誤會、故第一塲延至九時方開始、首塲大學組、滬江諸將因銳意進取、致後防門戶洞開、遂為約翰着着連中、以二十五比九、領先上半時、再戰後、滬江奮力追趕、攻守亦漸見聯絡、原有實力、亦告恢復、終以前半損失過多、雖以十九比十九以終、但終結已為四十四比二十八、而前週曾戰勝持志之滬江隊、終屈伏於素不景氣之的翰隊矣、决為獨立組黃蜂與靑光登塲、靑光首開紀錄後、卽為黃蜂以十一比二超出、惜曇花一現、靑光卽一鼓而下、反以十七比十六佔先上半時、再戰後靑光又以三十一比二十三前導、黃蜂再見活躍、積極追至三十一比三十一、時間亦已吿終循例再延長九分鐘、以分勝負、靑光張區梁剎那間又加上五分、黃蜂方由鄒自成擲中一球、不久、梁國權再中鵠的、靑光遂以三十八比三十三勝黃蜂、今日七時三刻開始、普通大學獨立三組各一塲、中以辛隊對麥令甲一戰、當有緊張局面、秩序如下、</p>
<p>斐律賓對慕爾（初）七時三刻</p>

<p>昨晚五時方亦德表演、確有驚人之處、最高紀錄之四十七分一槍、為其得勝之基礎、四十七分之獲、賴其出槍準確、輕重合度、而佈局允恰釗好處、對方哈洛潑處其支配之下、難以發展、材藝不如之故也、昨晚比數、方亦德以三〇〇比一九一勝、四塲結果、中靑共計勝　百五十九分、</p>

<h3>吾國「體育大使」黃伯長</h3>
<p>— 槐靑</p>
<p>體重二百十五磅是一個民族的模型　以摔角一技橫行歐美大陸所向無敵</p>
<p>十足合乎「彪形大漢」四字的標準，是中國稀有的一位巨人，以摔角一技，橫行歐美大陸，蜜聲國際，他就是否國的體育大使，旅美華僑黃伯長君。</p>
<p>上海愛好運動比賽的羣衆，對於這位中國民族的巨型黃伯長君，還不够相當的認識吧！本月四月當他初次在滬演出，擊敗菲律賓錦標阿奎諾度Aquinaldo，很少人注意這位事。可是本埠外僑，却非常驚異中國有這麼一位摔角大家呀！山此可知中西羣衆對於運動興趣的不同。原因對於黃君新近回國，而他的技術如何，更沒有充分的了解。現在他又要作第二次表演了，下星期二（十五日）對印度最著名摔角　之一的美哈Mehar，在聖喬琪角鬥。</p>
<p>這次是他第一次回到祖國。在香港曾和阿奎諾度一度交手，因裁判員的帮忙，判阿奎獲勝。二人乃相約來滬，作二次交手，於四日晚上在聖喬琪演出，黃君很容易地擊敗了阿奎。報復了在香港失敗之恨。印度名將美哈氏先前宣布要挑戰他們二人中的優勝者。所以黃君便當選與美哈角鬥。美哈是印度最有名的摔角大家，最近一二年內，遊行各地，從未遇到對手。他體重二百十八磅。黃君是二百十五磅。這次交戰，當然美哈比較有把握些；可是據黃君白說，一定要和他一拚。還說不定鹿死誰手。但照黃君過去的成績，不難將這位印度無敵英雄擊敗罷！</p>
<p>黃君現年三十一歲，虎腰猿臂，魁偉其軀，倍於常人。頭髮墨黑，襯着白嫩的肌膚，益顯出眉淸目秀。於一九零六年一月十一日生於支加哥，他的祖籍是廣東新會，父親名黃炳柏，（Wong　Bing　Pock三字的譯音）祗生一子，就是黃伯長君；女二，俱巳出嫁。</p>
<p>他從小喜愛運動，醉心於西洋拳術，暇時輒與同學練習，在學校中以拳鬥蜚　一時。稍長改習摔角，學的是美國式，以他的壯碩的體格，更兼特獨的運動天才，潛心訓練，技術大進，而成為有名的大力士，得過不少錦標。他在支加哥西北大學讀書，研究牙科。不幸父母雙亡，中途輟學，否則他將成為一個牙科醫生。從此他就成為職業摔角家了。</p>
<p>最近七年間，他奔走檀香山·舊金山紐絲倫·澳洲·加拿大等各大都市，比賽數百次，失敗不到十次，而且在澳洲舊金山等地，有許多世界著名摔角錦標，都被他擊敗；這許多光榮的戰績，使他的聲譽，傳播於歐美大陸。</p>
<p>他當然是說的一口流利的美國語，但也能說廣東話，能禾我們一般的用竹筷吃中國菜，不若其他的海外華僑完全不諳祖國國情。他在美國曾結過婚。但已分離了。他白願從此久屆祖國，久居上海。他願意一身盡瘁於摔角，極願意指導後進靑年，使個個都有壯碩的體格，頑强的實力，為國家儲才。</p>
<p>黃君的確是否國的一位體育大使，民族的模型，他在海外孤軍奮鬥，博得異國人士的欽仰。</p>
<p>十五日星期二，他將作第二次表演，地點仍在聖喬琪，門票計分四元三元二元等。</p>
<p>最後我把摔角的規則，簡略地介紹如下。每次比賽的勝負，定三賽二勝制。將對手雙屆按倒地上，歷三秒鐘；將對手拋出圈外；用小臂擊倒對手，歷十秒鐘不起者；用臂挾住對手頭部，使之昏蹶不能抵抗者；這些都作為勝一次。但不許用拳擊脚踢，更不得又住咽喉。平常以十分鐘為一回合，中間休息一分鐘。如雙方不分勝負時，則共賽七回合（七十分鐘，加七次休息，共七十七分鐘）。以定最後之結果。</p>

<h3>浙江省廿五年度　敎育文化費槪算　經常常臨時合計二百八十三萬餘元　較上年度增三十一萬千四百餘</h3>
<p>浙省二十五年度省敎育文化費概算、較上年度酌量增加其所以必須增列之原因如下</p>
<p>一、高初中程度學校（包含中學師範職業）自然增加十七班、又各簡師及各初級職業增授童子軍訓絲、故經費隨同增加、</p>
<p>二、師範生及實騐農校學生膳費津貼、按照實到人數核發本年度人數及班次、均有增加、故膳費津貼亦須增列、三、本省前經遵照約法原旨及敎育部令設置助學金獎學金援助貧寒獎進勤學、現復奉行政院及敎育部令、自二十五年度起、各校應設置免費學額及公費學額、除獎學金、仍照舊設置二三年級學生仍照助學金辦法辦理外、一年級新生分別遵照設置免費及公費學額（免費學額見歲人說明）公費額因學生數增多及公費給予數目照部定辦理、故本年度此項經費須增列、</p>
<p>四、縣市聯私立中等學校補助費、因照補助規程核准補助校數增多、故經費增列、五、本年度省立各中等學校班次、均有增加、原有房屋及設備不敷應用、須分別建築購置、又一部分學校、因校舍年久失修必須改建、故本年度各學校修建及設備等臨時費增列較多、</p>
<p>基上事實、故本年度概算經常門、計列二、五五四、八三七元、較上年度所列一、三七七、八〇八元、（內一四〇、〇〇〇元、義務敎育經費係在總預備費內動支原預算、本列二、二三七、八〇八元因增加一四〇、〇〇〇元、故如上數、）計增列一七七、〇二九元、臨時門計列二八〇、五〇〇元、較上年度所列一四三、〇三六元、計增列一三七四六四、經臨合計共　、八三五、三三七元、較上年度所列二、五二〇、八四四元、計共增列三一四、四九三元、</p>

<p>標紗前市開盤、十二月期因上日之餘威尙堅、但拍至遠期、某戶乘機巨量出籠、致檯面鬆懈而挫、二盤近月稍昂、遠期仍平、三盤十二月猛瀉三元、因紗銷岑寂、且多數同業、傾向拋賣、故壓力尙重、遠月尙平、迨至收盤近月平靜、遠月勿動、標紗結果各月比上日收盤價均跌一元四角、惟三月期僅跌五角、午後開盤、近期平靜、遠月較昂、大概有一部份掉期矣、同時現紗交易　悶、成交僅四百九十包外、結果十二·一月期比上午收盤價再跌二·六角、遠漲一元至一元一角、查賣出賡豐二千三百包、泰興八百包、仁豐八百五十包、大昌成一千包、長豐一千七百包、大昶一千二百五十包、永大一千四百包、同和六百包、誠三千二百五十包、恒德一千一百包、買進恒益八百五十包、吉豐一千包、緊興二千包、裕大八百五十包、明華九百九十包、豐泰八百包、愼記一千六百五十包、泰昌一千六百五十包、福康一千三百包、錦昌一千三百包、茲將一日間最高低及收盤價行市比較如左、</p>

<h3>投機者目標移轉　標花遂多顧問　為是紗價太高證金太鉅　不如舍而之花一展手腕</h3>
<p>棉市漲風亦起、因各路鄉農擯價不售、到貨减少、二則美印棉市轉趨上漲、邇來粉麥在騰市塲議論、棉麥有連帶關係、於是投機者目標轉向標花、</p>
<p>一日漲起七角餘</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、因美印棉市一致上騰、且有一部份對於棉價看漲、而與紗價比例、相差太遠、引起多方興趣、市價轉趨高翔、但某君逢漲時乘機巨量出檔矣、結果、各月比上日收盤價均漲四角半、午後開盤、市氣甚堅、緩步前進、散戶鑒於紗價太高、證金亦巨、目標轉變矣、買者一多、市盤富漲、遠月漲出四十四元外、結果各月比上午收盤價再漲二角半至三角半、查賣出、裕大一萬八千擔、同和三千四百擔、聚興三千八百擔、益康二千七百擔、吉豐四千擔、昌記三千四百擔、大慶二千二百擔、泰興三千四百擔、愼昌三千五百擔、同豐三千二百擔、望泰興二萬二千八百擔、生源四千七百擔、元一四千一百擔、泰昌三千一百擔、協成二千擔、源興昌一千九百擔、買進、恒益六千擔、大豐六千一百擔、明德三千一百擔、潤康一萬一千九百擔、福康八千一百擔、永大二千七百擔、合興六千二百擔、賡豐一萬六千三百担、興昌六千一百擔、豐泰六千四百擔、振大三千四百擔、泰昌七千八百擔、益昶四千一有百擔、福源四千六百擔、茲將一日間最高低及收盤價列左、</p>

<h3>糧食　粉麥升降靡定</h3>
<p>麥上午開盤後、各月份呈先漲後跌之象、當開價時、因洋報價續漲五七角左右不等、因此人心激昂、喊價甚俏、本月份較前日漲起七分、二月份以下、則漲二三分不等、迨至下午開盤、人心即見鬆軟、因粉巾回跌頗速、且又傳續定洋麥一船、致人心不佳、拋戶頗盛、至最後結局、本月份較前日無上落、一月份以下、則反跌二三分不等、現麥市面、仍見平穩、開洋河瑤灣麥六元六角半、高郵麥六元五角九分、天台麥六元五角四五分、蕪湖麥六元六角半、硤石麥六元五角、由福新辦去二千五百包云、</p>
<p>粉上午開盤後、各月份呈漲落不常之態、以洋麥報價、芝加哥漲七角零、坎拿大漲五角零、故開價後、人心又見挻貴、買氣之暢旺、亦與前日相仿、自本月份至四月份、較前日均漲反六七八分、惟至二盤、則市氣又復回跌、因客戶多頭、到此高昂檔口、陸續暢脫、吸戶力量、比較不敵、故較最高時、回落二三分不等、迨至下午開盤、初盤因傳洋麥又有定成一船、價五角零、因此人心甚軟、至二盤則外行又有吸進、市氣微覺回振、但至三盤以後、則因多頭回出亦猛、又呈小勢、目下市面、呼吸已將巨大、以洋麥定價雖昂、惟已開始訂購、故一部份心理、不免逐步轉動云、</p>

<h3>留別</h3>
<p>— 楚陽</p>
<p>記得我去年此時，正懷抱着闊別的渴望和新生的追求的意念，離開了風雪瀰濛的北國的危城，從海浪的顛播的旅程漂泊到上海；想不到今年此時，却要自這個旣混濁而又活躍的都市裏隱遁他去，重尋我那五年不曾回鄉的歸途，滿心是說不出的厭煩，又是說不出的依戀！</p>
<p>——你眞的决定了要走嗎？</p>
<p>朝夕相見的朋友也不知道我的眞意，用懷疑的眼光覷着我。我素來的决定都在心裏，表面上時常就含糊。自己的悲歡離合的感情說了出來也不能為大家所分担和共有，說它幹什麼？何况情威有時就是混淆不淸自己也說不明白的。</p>
<p>我拿「病」來解釋我的「走」，朋友也便如是。其實我們不是這樣愛惜我的生命，甚至於這樣自私的人。戰塲上中了彈還要爬起來舉槍向敵的也不一定要是英雄纔辦到得，眞正的戰士都能如此的。我固然重創了，兩决三决地咯血了，但我還不是爬不起來啊！</p>
<p>當然，我要沒有病，而且是這種沒有救藥的病，我為什麼會走呢？然而，我的去處也不是什麼良好的療養地帶，「我的老子也沒有給我留下一筆錢」，像我這樣除了一枝筆，幾本書的混食者，那裏談得到「休養？何况這多難的社會，不幸的人生早已造就了我好思慮，多懷疑的天性一刻不停的思想的頭腦，和一遇刺戟就被激動得騷擾不堪的心情，要求休息與安定下來，那簡直就不可能。寫信來邀我去住南嶽的璧，雖然我們隔絕了五年了，他還問得很對：「波瀾中游泳過來的你，能吾耐得住這山間的岑寂呢？」想起我去年大病之後，曾於暑天去住西山一月，林下泉畔，形影相伴，終於深感離羣乏苦，匆匆地又要尋別處去了，回憶那種山儈式的或者是隱者式的生活，這决的行脚不覺又躊躇。</p>
<p>共實我倒不怕寂寞，我不是會和巨大的寂寞碰過面來的麼？敢於和寂寞碰而的人纔是勇者，我又何嘗怯弱到怕寂寞。惟有那種生活中的空虛却是太可怕的，我却並不以為鄉村中的生活一定就寂寞，就空虛。我正以為置身在這吵吵嚷嚷，一無所為，唧唧喳喳，事無所成的蠢蠢而動的羣中，覺得寂寞，覺得空虛呢！天下有比吃飽了飯或祇吃了個半飽，從天到晚說閒話，嚼舌頭更空虛的麼？更無所事事的麼？有的人為了怕寂寞就挺身而出鬧一塲了；有的人為了不肯做或沒有別的事好做又來辦刋物了；也有的坦白地說出為了自己和妻兒過好生活而寫驚人之作；更有的是一點點簡單得可憐的成名的動機在牽引他的行爲；還有愚味得可笑的急功好利的自己在造就領袖地位的「英雄」；我看見太多的醜態，我聽見太多的笑話，「眞實，常然不是這一些，這些虛偽就付予我巨大的空虛！別人以為熱鬧，我正因此寂寞。</p>
<p>有一次，羣對我說：「你這是虛無主義的傾向」。我微笑得很天眞。我比誰都更明白我自己：我對於說謊，是一個虛無主義者，對於眞實，我是一個無疑的現實主義者呢。</p>
<p>有的朋友，或許以為我厭惡現實，因而放棄自己的任務，起了逃避現實的念頭。我不過極感旁觀者的痛苦，創傷的生命旣不能與現實决戰，反不如暫時沉默着，醫好我的創傷，培養一番新的精力，再來搏鬥。一個不堪奔走，氣量狹小，神經衰弱的人，立在鬥獸塲的邊綠上做什麼呢？看麼？</p>
<p>——你對於身體不能過於虐待，應該「長期休養，」這是必要的。民族加於我們的責任至巨，而我們自己又經接受這個重賣，為要獲得滿意的結果，無非惟有奮鬥；可是奮鬥的工具的身體不行，一切也談不到。我認為你眼前的賣任，是使你的身體回復健康，聽說你竟咯血，這還成個什麼樣—你應該趕緊找一個安靜的田園住他一年半載……</p>
<p>這是兄弟一般的劍操聽到我的景况後的來信，他的親切的體貼使我哭了一塲，他吿訴我和老友璧要我到璧的地方去養病，醫生早就對我警吿我數次，劍的話纔有催促我的力量。我便决定在我的心裏……</p>
<p>生命犧牲在戰塲上是並不十分可惜的，盲目的浪費和眼睜睜地死在病牀上，那是値得惋惜的啊。我去吧，離開這不生不死的生活—你墊伏着的這冰冷的亭子問會埋葬你呀，拋棄這墳墓，投到那新鮮空氣的乳母懷裏，讓不花錢買的陽光射死你蠕動在胸肺和週身間血裏的病菌。强健的靑年農夫是你的伙伴和榜樣，和他們一樣，强健了你的體魄，也强健了你的靈魂，你再回到這决戰的壕塹，你會促新找到你自己的崗位！</p>
<p>朋友們！我們再見。</p>
<h3>包頭一瞥</h3>
<p>— 櫻子</p>
<p>踏上了包頭城內的街道，我不禁低低的柯息着：『這地方已不同幾年前了呵」！</p>
<p>是的！包頭城的確和以前不同了。石子舖的硬硬的馬路，表面上顯着繁榮的街道，和新建起來的房屋，已一改幾年前：道路不平，電燈不明，電話不靈，一造成包頭城內的「二絕只是點綴這黃河碼頭，平綏路終點，水早碼頭的塞外一大城市的電燈電話，却還是不明不靈，依然成為似頭城內的「二絕」。原因是：電燈公司用的是本省出產的炭，這為了利用土產以致電燈不明倒還可以說得過去，電話的不靈却眞有點「那偭」了。據說：有一次縣長打電話，許久要不來，派人去電話局看，原來「司機生」先生正在「又八圈」呢！</p>
<p>幾年前這裏在夏天，是「蒼蠅的大本營」，蒼蠅之多，除了世界上某一個熱帶地方外，是佔第一位的。街道上堆積着厚厚的黃土，大爾的時候，水從建築在北面半山上的房屋小巷灌下來，於是包頭城內到了夏天，便是「行不得也哥哥」。如今，城外築成了東西水道，雨水是不會再灌到城裏來了。築水道碾下的碎石頭舖成了，平坦的馬路，作為一個城市小市民娛樂的公園，也在市中心區修築起來了，雖然那是由一個傾倒垃圾的地方改築成，裏面也只有些花花草草，然而，那總是一個奇特的花園呀！</p>
<p>同那不明亮的電燈光一樣黯淡的！是那沒有起色逐漸少下去的「買賣」。這幾年，因了歐亞航空的飛航何頭，皮毛的大宗輸出，「皮毛業」和「糧業」總算還勉强過得去。比較設備好一點，闊一點的「包頭飯店」也開設起來了。城裏住着各式各樣的人，山車的，河北的，綏遠各縣的，生活方式形相便也大大地不同。這地方儘多的是來這裏求生活，在「河路漢」（註一）萍蹤無定的苦力們和來做「買賣」的「西客」（註二）為這些人們產生的娛樂地，消遺處，性的發洩處的「平康里戲院的生意，比起距離有三百里的省會—歸化城來，有過之無不及，「價錢」雖然很高，倒常常是「賣滿座」的。</p>
<p>同一個朋友坐着人力車，走過了顛書的馬路，出了東門，到了包頭唯一名勝的「轉龍藏」，泉水從坡上的泉眼流下來，流，流，不斷地流下來，淸冽冽的。與其說這是包頭城的一名勝，倒不如說這是包頭人民生命的源泉了。因為：城內井水城得很，城裏的人全是吃用這一點泉水的。</p>
<p>從流着泉水的坡上爬上去，瞰望兩面的包頭城，是高高低低的房屋，北面是半禿的土山一座大雄竇殿孤立在那裏，對面是一個空蕩蕩地戲台，走進去一股幽幽唸經聲傳出來，和着那淸晰的磐聲，也許會使你起幽然之感吧？</p>
<p>和那幾　唸經的高儈談了幾句話，問一位高儈的法師說是「悟明」他送我們出來，看到他那灰綠的「癮君子」的面孔，我這才想到：他原來「悟」得是這樣的「明」！</p>
<p>走進城來再看到的便是觸目鮮艷的紅球旗子，一架友邦的無綫電台，插入了半天空，瞰視着包頭城，紅球尾巴的飛機照例的示着威，瀰漫於黃昏街頭的歌聲，已不再是凄楚的「爬山調」（註三）和哀怨的「水淹西包頭」，（註四）而是充滿了情怒與激情的：「小××，太橫行……」的怒吼聲了。</p>
<p>註一：從似頭到寗夏等處，在黃河上求生的人，通稱「河路漢」</p>
<p>註二：指寗甘靑來的商人。</p>
<p>註三：「爬山調」係在大靑山下生活的人們的一種山歌曲調。</p>
<p>註四：包頭從前多遭水災，流行過一支「水淹西似頭」的曲子。</p>

<h3>續由勤·沃尼爾戲曲雜寫（四）</h3>
<p>— 隅</p>
<p>在現代文學中，這似乎不是一個偶然的巧合，加特力敎與最進步的思潮，變為歐美文學前進與後退的分野標幟。在大不列顛，我們看到蕭伯訥和威爾斯這樣比較前進的作家，他們兩人，正如法國文學家「莫羅華」（Andre　Maurois所講的一樣，「面向着十九世紀的失敗，而尋找人類的解放於將來。」因此對於蕭伯訥，將來的社會是超人統治的社會，是凱撒與麥秀賽拉（Methuselah）混合兒的社會，而對於威爾斯，將來的社會，是科學家或專家統治的社會，是「試騐管與統計數字」治理下的社會。而在他方面，我們又見到加特力敎信徒今年剛去世的一切斯脫頓」（G.K.Chesterton與其好友而現在尙健在的「貝洛克」（HilaireBelloc）。這兩位加特力敎徒，因其思想的頑固而常常和蕭伯訥頑强地筆戰，被蕭老當為一個妖怪呌做「切斯脫貝洛克」（The　Chistirbelloc）的。這兩人當中，尤其是「切斯脫頓」，他的一貫的理論，司以拿來作為不列巔加特力敎徒文學思想的代表。他在他的「異端」（Heretics）與「正統」（Orthodoxy）兩害中，他反對現代社會思想，他認為現代的罪惡，是由於機器。人類的解放，是回歸到過去。更確切地說，是回歸到中世紀的神秘主義，而人類對於基督敎有堅定的信仰。雖則基督敎是有時不合邏輯的，世你須知道世界本身就是小合邏輯的。如果一個鑰匙只適合一把鎖，那末基督敎就是這唯一的鑰匙。因此基督敎是像一座巨大的不平的神奇的巖石，雖有時因為一擊而動搖，却經過幾千年又很平穩地立定了。為了這原故，他在他的「正統」一書中，强調地說：「基督敎敎會……是一個生存的敎師。它不但昨天敎導找，但在明天也一定敎導我。……是一個宗敎牠在明天吿訴你眞理正和今天一樣。」（以上所引述的，皆根據英譯本莫羅華所着之「先　與詩人二書中論G．K切斯脫頓一章</p>
<p>莫羅華　　　斯　　」，　　相信普通人，而其說敎，也是普通人的說敎，為以他是智識的民主主義者？可是他的那種普通的說敎，卻是替過去問護，以及替旣有社會　護最有九的人。浦力汗諾夫會呌尼采為一巨偉的市民」，因為他所寫的哲學的詩，是資產階級文學中最偉大的成就。同樣我們也可以呌這位加特力敎徒的文學家「切斯脫頓」「偉大的使徒」，因為他的帶滿機智的說敎是擁護基督敎最力的「新福音書」。可惜道位使徒生在二十世紀的今日，使他那種神秘主我，不能被人推祟，而只被人嘲笑為妖怪，這是他死而有知，也許要認為遺憾的。那些想把時代拉回轉去的人，我總認為是世間最愚妄的蠢漢。一個時代有其時代的說敎，違背時代的說敎，雖則拉住了人的耳朶，而把它硬放送於人進去，也不會得着他們所希冀的効果。因為一個新的說敎出來，一個舊的說敎，必然死去。初期基督敎會有傳說，講到當天神天將吿訴「貝士拉漢」（Bethlehem）的牧羊者耶穌降生的時候，希臘全境，部聽一憫深長的呻吟，那是表示偉大的般神（基督敎認為他是異端神的代表者）已經死了，而一切亞靈辟克的諸神，也都退位了，而另外還有好多神袛已繼放逐至寒冷和黑暗中去。這雖出之於基督敎的宜傳，可是我們也可以假定，新的一定代舊舊的，那是無疑的。雖則詩人「瓦茲渥斯」對於異敎的衰息，表示哀悼，曾有下列詩句：</p>
<p>『偉大的上帝，我寗願是</p>
<p>一個異敎徒，吮吸於陳舊的敎條中，這樣，我可以，站在這愉快的草地，有好些多次瀏覽使我比較少寂寞些；可以看到「柏魯脫期」從海中升起，和聽老「脫利東」吹他纏繞花圈的號角」</p>
<p>然而這也不過是代表個人哀悼過去的情緒吧了。我們不能回返希臘時代，正如我們不能回返中世紀一樣。我們早已聽到新時代的呼聲，我們為什麼不熱烈歡迎和忿加新時代的創造運動呢？這巳是很長久的歷史，我們在前一世紀的四十八年代，聽到新世紀的第一决吼聲。我們在前一世紀的六十七年代，我們見到新世紀繼領的公佈。我在在這一世紀的——年代，我們見新世紀的草創開始。一切人如果都不像「切斯脫頓」那機迷戀過去，我相信一定會轉變的。在法國，我們雖然看到「保羅·克勞德（Paul　Claudel）那樣以「加特力敎」便徒目命而勸許多法國文學家改宗加特力敎的文學家，但我們也看到法朗士與紀德的走向新時代。法朗士在第三共和未成立前他是完全同情於當時成立於凡爾賽市民政府的人，他用一個假姓名，帶了一個比利時的護照，逃到凡爾賽後，寫信給他的父母，關於公社的黨員，會這樣說：「流氓……他們是可懀的，像你們所能想像的。當第三共和成立後，他回到巴黎，他感覺「智識階級的生活在巴黎並沒有完全喪失掉」，所以他很滿意。到了一九一四年，他中張參戰，雖達七十歲的高齡，仍願服務兵役。然而等到他的老友「加育」被老虎總理克里孟援關起來，並且如果法朗士多開口批評，也有被用同樣手段對付的危險，他終於被拖到新的方面去了。他的妙語「與其被趕了去，還是被拖了去好」，這就可以表示時代的進展，使許多有正義感的人，不能不跟着時代而進展了。</p>
<p>至於紀德的由法國個人主義而轉向，那更是一個動人的事實。在一九二五年，當紀德五十五歲的時候，為實現他終身偉大的懷抱去探尋法屬剛果地帶的秘密，他最初看到人類社會的慘狀。他未出發之前，他認為在那地帶，可以得到所謂「淫奢的快樂」，和「忘記掉一切」，與享樂蔚藍的天和原始的森林。但當他一達殖民，在「雨本奇」地方，他看到十五個殖民地的男子和兩個女人用一根繩繫在一起，這些人差不多已不能步行在這些人後面，還有兩個看守者，拿着鞭子。這一事實給他很深刻的印象。不久以後，他完全明白法國殖民地當局，是用鐵腕來統治黑人。而殖民地政府唯一個職務，是在用恐怖流血和高壓的手段，使一百二十萬的黑人做成奴隸。這些村莊上的人民是像戰爭時候一樣動員去做奴隸的工作，而為造一條鐵路，差不有一萬七千人犧甡掉了性命。有時，為壓迫黑人工作，不惜用刑罰鞭撻來達到他們的目的。他會經過一個村莊，那裏面有二十五個黑人就受到這機身體的迫害。更使紀德覺得不忍的，就是那些黑人都是忠實而待人親醬。就他自已的話來說：「如許的忠誠……如許的善實……和親善的可能性，完全獲不着什麼而只有叱責……我感覺此地是一個整個受苦的人類，一個可憐被壓迫的人種。一道一事件經過幾年的醞釀，終於使他轉變了。他於是發出勇敢的呼聲，「我一定要呼喊，大聲呼喊我對於一個國家的同情，而也一定要使我的聲昔被人聽見，這件事是很重要的。我一定要長久生活下去看這偉大努力的成功，這一個成功，我整個的靈魂都渴望着，而為了這，我也願意能够去工作……」。（以上參考W.Jroy:The　Convertion　ofAndre　Gide,　Nation，Vol.139，No.3615）</p>
<p>法朗士由濃重的加特力敎而走向新時代，紀德沒有被「克勞德」說服而對被壓迫的人類發生隆厚的同情，都足以使我們感覺到那麻醉人的代帝國主義宜揚毒素的宗敎勢力，在一個有正義感的人，明白了牠的作用後，必然向之一蹴。同時也可以明白加特力敎的敎條，在市民的作家中，巳被認為防護他們璧壘的唯一武器。</p>
<p>說來奇怪，在沃尼爾的好多作品中，這兩種對立的思想，却並存着。他的思想，也經過好幾决變更。我們知道，靑年時代的沃尼爾，是一個和平主義者，是一個反對美國「商業文明」的人。一九一四年，他發表他的詔示（The　Call）一詩中，他向世界勞工呼籲，不要參加戰爭，他向他們提出了疑問，是吾他們願為「吉根海姆流血與呻吟」和為「美孚煤油公司犧牲性命」。一九一七年的在「羣衆」上發表「我的靈魂是一個潛水艇」，則是對大商業的反感，他的詩如下：</p>
<p>「我的大志是魚雷。</p>
<p>我要掩藏起來不被看見，</p>
<p>在生命浮面的下而，</p>
<p>伺察着船，</p>
<p>笨的重載的商船，</p>
<p>銹蝕的灰暗的商用的載金銀的船，</p>
<p>在笨拙的安詳態下徐行</p>
<p>迂緩而辜不畏懼和驚奇，</p>
<p>被浪花的大笑譏嘲着</p>
<p>和被輕蔑的泡沬所唾吐。</p>
<p>我要毀壞他們，</p>
<p>因為海是美麗的。」</p>
<p>在「毛毛猿」這一劇中，我們也可以看判那位主角「楊開」因為受到船主女兒汚辱而思報復，他去加入那些「美國」資本家御用的黃色工會。他旣做了會員，他吿訴支會的秘書，他願意去炸毀那鋼鐵托辣斯。然而這些話却使那位秘書吃驚，於是那位秘書，呌了手底下幾個助手，把他抓牢舉起來從支部的門口摔在「鋪石子的小街上」。他感覺無助，然後才到動物院的「猴室」中去找同伴，而終於鈹人猿打死。這一劇的終極的意義，究在什麼地方，自然很難肯定。不過照我想來至少沃尼爾是有這樣意義的：那些黃色工會，只不過欺騙人吧了。而從被壓迫中解放出來，决不是個人瘋在的「唐吉訶德」行動所能達到。在「馬可百萬」（Marco　Millions），著者也用「馬可波羅」這位中世紀而帶着「現代白培德」型的名人來無情地諷刺崇拜貪欲之神「麥蒙」的市民階級，這劇中的大意是元朝蒙古大汗的公主「庫拉金愛上了馬可波羅遭位客卿，當公主遠嫁到波斯的時候，他請求他的父親命令馬可指揮駛往波斯的船隊。然而這位客卿却乘此機會要求大汗給他沿途貿易的特權。在旅途中，「庫拉金」已明白那位客卿的商人特質，而很輕視他。在其也劇中，沃尼爾也把那腐爛的現存社會的罪惡，無情地暴露出來。美國一個守舊的批評家「克拉克」（Barret　Clark）對沃尼爾的劇本，曾經這樣統計過：「從三十五個我所讀過的劇本中，那兒只有五個劇本裏面，沒有暗殺，死亡，自殺，或瘋在。在其他劇中，我找出自殺的總數共有六個，一個沒有成功的目殺；十個重要的暗殺；十九個死亡；和六倘瘋在的事件」。這樣的一切不合理的情節，並不是作者個人的虛構，而自有其社會的根據，試問這是那些主張返歸過去把天堂設在人的死後所能解决的麼？我們不需要死的說敎和死的說敎者，我們沒有空去想那死了以後的事件。生的意義，遠重過於死，而我們所要求的是把天堂建設在地上。新的神也許是發電機及控制發電機及其他一切的「斯賓塞」所說的「第一原則」，這第一原則巳被人發現而應用着。牠將造成眞正的民有民使民享的新系統。我們旣有這一把鑰匙，我們為什麼還要那只有使我痛苦更深而毫沒有解救希望的加特力敎呢？自然讀者們可以牽批到沃尼爾的「無盡的日子」（Days　Witiont　End）中，說這劇有濃重加特力敎傾向。「無盡的日子」的劇中英雄，會好多年在一種苦悶中，這種苦悶，使他由有信仰而變為無神論者，由無神論者而變為社會主義者，由此而走入放縱之途，並欲謀害其可愛妻子的生命。最後因為跪在十宇架下，解除了他的心裏的苦悶，和他的一切罪惡的根源而尋得他的安身立命的根基。可是這一劇本，其意義究屬如何，還是一個爭執的問題，由加特力敎看來，認為最後勝利是屬於加特力敎的，而由另一羣人看來，而其勝利是屬於另一方面的。總之沃尼爾的思想，現在尙在發展過程中，究竟他轉向那一方面，目前還不能斷定。他如不像一個隱士一樣逃避生活，逃避人羣，他一定會明白人羣的生活是應該怎樣，歷史的發展是走向怎樣，而他也一定會走上一切作家所應走、的路。所以屈里靈（Lionel　Jrilling）的說話：「哲學的地位看起來是最後一個：沃尼爾已經爬入教會黑暗的胞胎而把整個的宇宙也一同拉進。」（Eugene　Oneill　Rcpublic,No　1138），也許言之過早吧！（完）</p>

<h3>萬物騰貴不是好現象</h3>
<p>— 劍平</p>
<p>有時候，有些人會感覺到「萬物騰貴」是好現象，非常快樂。但這限於「有時候」，而且是「有些人」，大多數人是並不這樣的。大家想，在我們中國這麼個「國難方殷」的時候，又碰到了「萬物騰貴」，那不單止不會是好現象，而且是一件致命傷。</p>
<p>那些人如果戚到「萬物騰貴」，物價不斷的高漲是非常快樂的事，那麼，我們朝好」方而說他，那還是「不懂道理」。當然，他們也「自以為是」的，以為的是物價高漲是由於購買力提高，景氣同復。但我們敢告訴他們；這是「夢」。我們不要在身上插上翅膀飛上半空去做夢，如果我們選「脚踏實地」的話，便當知道我們這世界還是普遍地鬧着經濟恐慌，所謂「特種蕭條」的狀態，還是死跟着我們，不讓我們去超越他，因此失業者的數字一天一天增加，工錢（卽使是有職業的人）也一天一天地减低，大多數人都處在生活毫無保障的狀態，大家想想：景氣怎樣回復？購買力又用什末方法來提高？那不是白日做夢嗎。對於那些「別有心腸」的人，我們是不能不指出他們的陰謀。</p>
<p>我們知道，現在的萬物騰貴，决不是「合理的」，「自然的」漲價，而是「人為的」陰謀。我們現在拿最基本的生活要素——食糧來舉例吧。今年是「豐年」，人入的嘴吧都這樣說：可是人人能够不說今年「豐收也成災嗎？在我們這一面——都市的一而，是看到「米船到埠日减，米市漲風更厲」。「多方祇顧吸收，標粉漲勢奇特」。和「麥本身無問題，但受標粉影響」，以及「紗花連朝猛漲」。（均見八日本報經濟版）那麼，一定有人以為豐收的農民今年會舒服一點了吧？可是實際怎樣呢？米麥價高漲和他們依然是無綠的。在他們，「一邊有催租催債的人逼着你非趕快賣穀不行，一邊有收買五穀的人，祇肯給根低的價錢，呌你非賤賣不行」。我們所受的損失——漲價，却仍不是利益於辛苦了一年的農民，而是中飽在「囤積居奇」的收買食糧的商人的大腹裏。那麼，我們還能希冀着：萬物騰貴雖於我們毫無好處，但於農民仍有好處嗎？——這當然也是夢想。</p>
<p>現在，我們該明白了吧，所謂「物價不斷上漲」，無非是一般奸商乘機壟斷，把這本已疲弱衰老的市面，弄得越發不成樣子。年底快到了，一個天大的難關—年關便要到來，當然給這「人為的」萬物騰貴所拖倒的正式商人當不在少數。然而，他們便願意這麼地給拖倒了嗎？如果不願意便該給予這一類奸商以「商業的制裁」，同時我們的當局也應嚴厲取締。我們更淸楚目前的形勢，綏邊戰事的影響，敵方擾亂我後方的陰謀是千萬不能忽略的。因此，對於目前這一可怖的萬物騰責的畸形狀態，實應急謀相當的對策，迅速穩定物價。</p>
<h3>交易</h3>
<p>— 徐疾</p>
<p>太陽斜西的時分，弄裏的那家小學校裏依舊還在擠出些雜亂的唸書的嘶呌，客堂樓的三四年級合併的敎室中在讀着地理敎科書，亭子間裏的一二年級合併敎室中各各在讀着國語興常識課本，還有由灶屋改裝而成的五六年級敎室中則在讀着國文與歷史課本。那幾十條小喉嚨，彷彿已用盡了他們所有的氣力，聲嘶力竭地在嘶喊着一些什麼。像抗夫們底打哼，也像和尙們在拜懺一這已是一天的最末一課了，大家祗希望哼到打了鐘，便程快拉起書包，拖着破的鞋子，流着靑黃的鼻涕從那重「單幢石庫門」裏四散地衝出去，如黃昏在天空中亂噪的烏鴉一樣，一陣在亂與囂擾，把空氣攪得像汚濁的水，呌弄裏的居民沒有一個不頭痛……</p>
<p>是的，不特是那些稱作「學生」的十來歲的孩子們那麼熱望打鈴，便是敎員（他們，連自己也多半是二十歲左右的大孩子呀—雖然敎員全體的總數也不滿五個，可是，全是那種萎靡的，疲乏的，落下去的「靑年」！）便是「校長」自己，也希望快點打鈴——每天一散學，大家都像還去了一天的債務似的，鬆一口氣，想：「又是一天過去了！」</p>
<p>然而這一天，太陽一偏西，校長和幾個敎員們都祖心起來了：這一向校長不寬裕得根，據說欠了六個月的房錢，法院裏來了傳票，最近連餐食都感到困難起來了，譬如像今天，從早上起大家就巳經知道：二桌晚飯又成了問題了。</p>
<p>敎員們在根輕的年齡上帶了老年的神色：枯乏，萎頓。臉上帶着飢餓的，失望的神情，有的站在門口看野景，有的抓住半張申報發呆。錢，在他們是已經有大半年來沒看到了：在這世界裏，由於生活的惡劣，他們一切都是不成熟的，流產的，在這大都會裏做了一隻頂可憐的虫豸，除了在這些地方混口飯吃，此外還有什麼路可以走呢？而校長是頂聰明的，他看透各人的苦痛，比各人看自己更淸楚，而他，也就利用這一點致命的苦痛，扣尅起十來塊錢一個月的「薪水」，呌大家吃點白飯。</p>
<p>可是卽使如此精巧也沒有用處，校長自己也混到了末路上來了。每個學期開始的時候，印傳單，印廣吿，呌那唯一的永遠拿不到工錢的老校役，滿街滿巷地去貼；又另外用了許多心思，把學費减到了三四塊錢的光景，又送各科用書啦，又可以免費加入假期補習班啦。然而市面是實在太不景氣」了，卽使是三四塊錢，卽使是那麼「優待」，有志來學的還是少得可憐，靠着百來個襤褸貧血的頑皮孩子，一班一班地那麼苦混下去，妻子孩子全要吃要着，房錢欠得不能再欠了，而捐錢是一點也少不去的。雖然他知道那些敎員不給錢也不要緊，他把握得很對：他們跑不到那裏去的。</p>
<p>這樣他天天沮喪着，「辦敎育辦得灰心了。結果是在報紙的廣吿欄中登了一則出讓學校的廣告：「茲有地段適中，學生發達之小學校一所………一接着是天天希望有人會來問訊，希望把那所學校換上幾百塊錢用用，讓自己跟女人孩子「舒暢」一些日子，在這汚濁的生活中透一口氣………</p>
<p>然而就在那黃昏，大家都急着開不出晚飯的時候，終於有了光顧的來客了。幾位骨瘦加柴的靑年敎員帶着渴望的，飢餓的眼晴望着　位未來的「主子」，想也許以後的命運會好一點了？然而他跟校長談話談得根輕，站在遠處一點也聽不出。祇能從彼此顛頭恍腦中看出交易的順利。</p>
<p>突然，校長嘻開牙齒露出了一陣哈哈大笑：「哈哈哈哈，這一陣你老兄不必顧及，在我手下的敎員，薪水待遇是不會怎樣便宜他們的！」</p>
<p>像一羣待宰的羊，二個飢瘦的靑年敎員在瑟瑟地打起顫抖來了。</p>
<p>「那命運依舊是一樣的！」</p>
<p>校長的笑聲更加歡快起來了，在凄暗的黃昏的燈下，祇有那陣粗暴可怕的笑聲，才保證了這一决的交易的成功…</p>
<h3>食死蟹者死</h3>
<p>— 佳</p>
<p>偶然在一張外埠報紙上讀得一則新聞：有鄉人某甲，以廉値購得死蟹數隻</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>，煮面食之，幷盡麥酒一瓶，夜半忽腹痛如絞而死。—這是新聞，也是事實，最後才是那位記者下的結論，「聞係誤食毒蟹所致云」。</p>
<p>那則新聞是刋報紙的角落里的，而且語焉不詳，要斷定是否誤食毒蟹（是吾有一種蟹呌做「毒蟹」，也是個疑問）致死，或是那位某甲本來是要死了，而恰恰在那時吃了幾隻死蟹，那是不在本文之內，要仰求大醫士的化騐了。</p>
<p>不過食蟹而致死的，頗有所聞，因貪其他口福之厚而致死的，也是隨時隨地可以見到，聽到的。譬如明明知道「拚死吃河豚」，而今年的報紙上筆者就看到過二則吃河豚而死的老饕。那末，吃幾隻死蟹而傷身者，眞是太普通了。（現在姑且認為是誤食毒蟹而死。）</p>
<p>中國人對於「吃」是本來頗為講究的，且負聲望。什麼吃牛猴腦，三蛇大會等等，可以說達吃的頂峯了。而歷朝大人先生們的掌故中，更不乏為了一個菜而砍下了一個廚子的腦袋的遊戲筆墨」的。現在世界各國的都市都有中國菜館，就被有些人目為為國爭光」的。不過拿這些事實來蹬明中國人的講究「吃」的一項，似乎已經沒有異議了。</p>
<p>且也：中國人旣講究吃的「東西」，更着重於吃的「時令」，閉着眼睛想一想，端午要吃角黍，中秋自然少不了月餅，其他吃重陽糕或什麼糰子等，更是不勝枚舉。現在秋風已起，束籬菊黃的時候，自然又是蟹的時令了。卽以上海一隅而論，大街小巷，淸水大蟹的市招幾乎有些目不暇接，可見自有那末多人每天在維持靠蟹市的商人的營業，不問淸水大蟹久河水小蟹，大家煮一壺酒，邀幾個朋友來大嚼一頓，以應時令。</p>
<p>在「以應時令」之中，又可以分為兩類，一是過時過節吃些以好口腹，一種是另有大道理在—「所謂一風雅」是也。前者不必去講，他們旣沒有拚死吃河豚的勇氣，吃幾隻蟹還捨不得多化幾個錢，僅以廉値購得死蟹數隻，以致腹痛如絞而死去。卽鄉人某甲等是。風雅的人是不在乎蟹的味道，他們是由於「籬菊綻黃」，才想到有「持螯」之舉。所以無論大規模地草了什麼啟，並下了請柬，幾十個人聚攏來恐怕吃不了幾隻蟹，詩詞歌賦却吟了一大堆，風雅人的吃時令理由即在此。</p>
<p>然而風雅與庸俗人之分還不僅在吃時令表面上的區別，就以那則外埠新聞來作例子吧，我們就未聞在一個雅的集團中有一位詩人突然腹痛如絞而死去的，否則，卽使想風雅，恐怕也雅不下去了。而庸俗人如鄉人某甲者吃了幾隻死蟹，卽誤食毒蟹而死去了。</p>
<h3>棄尸</h3>
<p>— 陳浩雄作</p>
<h3>霜夜</h3>
<p>— 林加</p>
<p>午夜，我被寂靜的重量壓醒了。我推開窗子，夜是濃的，我希望能聽到幾聲遙遠的驢鈴，一串少女的笑聲，或一道淸溪的激動………但從窗外流入的：是冬夜的冷風，風中一盞，迷蒙的水霧籠罩着的街燈，在這沉睡的都市中，張著隻惺忪的眼，街心，一片片的梧桐葉，駝着那銀粉似的冰霜，打灰色的路上旋轉。</p>
<p>周圍是靜寂的，窗口對面的紅色小樓上，還閃着一星淺紅的燈火，那裏面住着一對老年夫婦，老女人的一雙眼睛瞎了。在白書，常有一個垂着兩條小髮辮的少女，領她下樓，老人非到每天深夜，才咳嗆着敲門。那女孩子給他開了門，用手杖敲打着樓梯，登登的饗着爬上來，不久，從那個掛着花格幃簾的小窗口，便淡薄地透出鴉片烟香氣，今夜，仍舊燈亮着，大槪老夫婦倆都臥在烟榻上，細瑣地談若什麼，一息，老太婆悲愴的說：</p>
<p>「在開封我買余苹的時候，她才七緊，我耐心的養了她十年，什麼都會替我了，像我親生的女兒一樣，徧徧有你這老畜牲，想糟塌她，她是十七，你是五十歲的人了，唉…………</p>
<p>「她，她跟三樓上那個畫書的學生跑了，我不能白養她，我非弄回她來買給朱四奶奶不可！」</p>
<p>隱約的，我明白了這故事的輪廓，那個有一雙小髮辮，圓臉，大眼睛的女孩子，不願受那老烟鬼的踐踏，跟一個靑年人逃跑了。可是比這冬夜更冷酷，更沉暗的社會中，會讓她逃脫出那數不淸的陷阱嗎？願她堅强，願她得到幸福。我看着紅色屋頂上已飛滿了一層濃厚的霜花，我感到夜氣更形凌人了。等我關了窗，重睡到床上去，對面的燈火還沒有息，語聲却低沉得聽不淸晰了。</p>

<p>齊國馮驩赤骨貧。會經投謁孟嘗君。自家懷刺登門拜。乍叙寒溫問姓名。狼狽衣冠羞面目。客無好也客無能。知君慷慨知君義。願厠，千食客人。分上下中三舍。究竟東君愛客心。閒來倚往三彈劍。食則無魚出則行。况無衣食及家庭。大度田文無小允。揚揚意氣訴親鄰。一且薛中收債務。自然勞力費先生。矯詔傳呼焚契券。並將牛酒犒貧民。一雙空手歸報命。與君市義布聲名。不料齊王收相印。薛中父老謝深恩。馮驩遊說秦邦去。抵掌而談句句聽。高車駟馬收田文。齊國敬向秦國聘。仍為齊相立朝庭。半生富貴馮驩力。食客三千難評論。足智多謀冠古今。</p>

<p>開篇「酒中仙」</p>
<p>昔日西川降謫仙。長庚星入夢產多賢。才通四海無窮異。斗酒在吟詩百篇。只因能識番邦字。故而聲明尙世間。聖旨召。常遲延。這在長安市上酒家眠。天子駕前無忌憚。自稱臣是酒中仙。專權力十將靴脫。罷幸椒臣把墨研。贓成三首淸平調。補人梨園奏管弦。玻璃盃賜葡萄酒。兔毫落紙染雲烟。只因飛燕新妝句。楊娘娘誤信衆讒言。掛冠翛然致仕去。流落江湖十幾年。一封丹詔從大降。各處衙門領酒錢。到采石磯捉月乘鯨去。千古英豪難並肩。有誰人不曉李靑蓮。</p>

        <h1>1936.12.11</h1>
<h3>After the National Army captured Dajiao Temple, northern Sui may be temporarily free of war. Wang Ying is missing, and the bandit forces are disintegrating. A certain party bombed the uprising troops. The puppet army of Rehe is still eager to capture Suidong. Zhang Haipeng's troops have arrived in Baochang.</h3>
<p>(Guihua) Our army launched an attack on Dajiao Temple on the night of the 9th. By 11:00 AM on the 10th, it had completely occupied the temple. The first to enter the temple were the Li Siwen troops of Fu Zuoyi's army. Our army captured a large number of guns, ammunition, and provisions. They are currently being reorganized. Several bandit planes dropped dozens of bombs on Wulanhua on the 10th, and more than 50 soldiers of the newly reformed Jin Xianzhang's troops were injured. Fu Zuoyi has sent cars to the area to transport the wounded soldiers back to Sui for treatment. The war in northern Sui has come to an end. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) At 11:00 AM on the 10th, the National Army recaptured Dajiao Temple. The local Mongolian people warmly welcomed the entry of the National Army and rushed to offer their condolences. (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) Since Wang Ying's bandit troops revolted one after another, Commander Li of Fu Zuoyi's troops led his troops to recapture and occupy Dajiao Temple (i.e., Beile Temple) at 11:00 AM on the 10th. The bandits fled without a trace. The rumors that Dajiao Temple had been recaptured on the evening of the 9th are inaccurate. (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) Several planes from a certain party bombed the newly reformed Jin Xianzhang's troops north of Wulanhua on the 10th, causing more than 50 casualties. It is reported that after hearing the news, Fu Zuoyi immediately sent cars to the area to provide relief. By 6:00 PM, the dead and wounded soldiers had been transported to Sui. The reporter encountered them on the way, and the sight was unbearable. (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhangbei, A certain special agency in Jia Temple has discovered Wang Ying's connection with Sui regarding his surrender, which is very annoying. Because Wang's troops have many new weapons, and more than one million dollars have been spent since April, without any success, they have successively revolted. Therefore, the agency hates Wang to the bone. Wang himself is missing. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhangbei, More than 1,000 artillerymen and more than 30 steel cannons of Zhang Haipeng's Rehe army arrived at Lijia Yingzi, which belongs to Baochang, on the evening of the 9th. 800 cavalry arrived at Yutiaogou, and another 800 cavalry arrived at Kangbao Shichengzi. There are also 300 regular troops from a certain party, waiting for an opportunity to advance westward. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to intelligence, because the bandits and puppets repeatedly failed to attack the Sui border, and in view of the frequent revolts, a large number of puppet troops have been transferred from Xing'an and are successively advancing towards Shangdu. Motor transport between Shangdu and Weichang is busy, and most of the gasoline and coal are taken from the Northeast. It is expected that after the puppet troops' reinforcements arrive and are deployed, the main battle will begin. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A visitor from Chengde said that military transportation in Chengde has been extremely busy recently. Cars and trains loaded with supplies are continuously moving westward day and night. Most of the Japanese and puppet troops in various counties have been concentrated in Chengde and distributed to northern Chahar. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) The revolting troops of Wang Ying's army are Jin Zhizhang and Shi Yushan, two divisions of infantry and cavalry. Among them, the initiator was Ge Zihou, the brigade commander of Jin's troops. They intended to contact comrades to revolt. On the morning of the 9th, Ge led his troops at Dajiao Temple to disarm the Mokedengbao troops of De Wang's Seventh Division, and then went to Wulanhua to visit Zeng Yan Yi. He came to Sui on the night of the 9th and visited Fu Zuoyi on the morning of the 10th. He did not leave Sui that day. He is scheduled to return to his defense on the 11th or 12th to reorganize his troops. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Jining telegram: There are currently three planes parked at a certain special agency's airport in Baotou. They fly between Sui, Qingning, Ejina, and northern Chahar every day, conveying secret orders very busily. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Jining telegram: After Wang Ying's troops revolted, the puppet troops of Li Shouxin, Zhang Junzhe, etc., are all wavering, mostly because they have no way to make contact. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Jining telegram: Wang Ying's special service regiment was surrounded and disarmed by the puppet troops of Li Shouxin and Zhang Junzhe between Shangdu and Kangbao on the 9th due to the influence of the revolt of Shi Yushan and Jin Xianzhang's troops. The regiment resisted, causing many casualties. A unit broke through and fled to Pangjiang in Jia Temple. The puppet army is chasing them. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to reliable sources, since the bandit and puppet troops invaded Sui, a certain country transported poisonous gas to the front line to prepare for release. At the same time, a certain country's merchants are manufacturing a large number of gas masks in Shanghai and Tianjin and selling them cheaply, each only selling for 3 yuan and 50 cents. In fact, they have no gas protection effect, and they are speculating and deceiving the Chinese. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Dispatching personnel to count and inspect the troops of Shi and Jin.</p>
<p>(Guihua) After Shi Yushan and Jin Xianzhang revolted, Fu Zuoyi is sending personnel to count and reorganize them, and has telegraphed Chairman Chiang and Vice Chairman Yan to report the process. He intends to appoint Shi and Jin as brigade commanders. The location where the two troops are stationed is also under study. It is reported that Shi came to Sui on the morning of the 10th to visit military officers. (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The original telegram from Shi Yushan and others on the 8th, transferred from Taiyuan, was received here on the 10th, as follows: (abridged titles) Knowing Your Excellency, We, believing that the country is in trouble and foreign troubles are urgent, being nationals, how can we betray? Only because our situation is getting worse day by day, we have to temporarily submit in order to wait for an opportunity to fulfill our wishes. Yushan and others have served the party and the country for many years, and it is difficult to be an accomplice and help the wicked. Therefore, after several preparations, we have gathered a brigade of elite cavalry, seeing that the opportunity has arrived, and acting in accordance with justice, we have carried out the national salvation campaign on December 8. From now on, we are willing to be under the leadership of Director Yan, Chairman Chuan, and Commander Ge, in order to fulfill our responsibility to protect the country and defend the people. We hope that Your Excellency will understand. Shi Yushan, Su Yihe, Zhang Xiaoyuan, Hui Fuchen, Wang Fengxian, together kowtow, sealed. (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Captured bandit officers and soldiers sent to and influenced in Taiyuan.</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Fu Zuoyi telegraphed Yan, requesting instructions on how to punish the captured puppet bandit officers and soldiers in the Sui war. Yan replied and ordered them to be sent to the Taiyuan Training Institute for instruction, in order to renew themselves. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Li Hongwen talks about the collapse and retreat of the bandits and puppets.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Li Hongwen, director of the Taiyuan Pacification Commissioner's Office in Beijing, went to Shanghai to meet Kong and returned to Beijing. According to his talk, he received a telegram from Taiyuan that the war in northern Sui was very smooth. The bandit puppet troops at Dajiao Temple were severely suppressed by us and retreated backward. Shi Yushan of Wang Ying's bandit troops has led four regiments of cavalry to revolt. The remaining remnants are not many and are being pursued. There is no problem in northern Sui. I went to Shanghai on orders to contact Minister Kong about the issue of subsidies. We have discussed it four times. Kong is very concerned about this. In addition to the several appropriations that have been made before and after, Kong has promised to quickly raise the remaining insufficient amount and remit it in installments. He has also promised to discuss with the military department the remaining shortfall in the monthly regular expenses in addition to the central government's subsidy. I have telegraphed Director Yan about the contact situation at any time. The support association organized by all circles in Shanghai is very enthusiastic about soliciting donations for cold-proof clothing, gas masks, and medicines. I have met and discussed with Mr. Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Lin Kanghou, Huang Renzhi, and others several times. It is reported that more than 3,400 comfort items such as silk cotton vests, 1,000 pairs of gloves, and more than ten boxes of medicines have been collected and will be transported to the front line soon for distribution to the soldiers. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the "Manchu" and Mongolian mixed troops were defeated at Bailing Temple, they used Dajiao Temple as their headquarters. According to a telegram from Chinese sources in Suiyuan received here today, the Sui army occupied the Lama Temple after a full day of fierce fighting. The enemy is now fleeing to the east and northeast. It is said that the Sui army annihilated a division of the enemy, which may be an exaggeration, but the enemy's casualties must be not small. It is rumored that Wang Ying himself is missing. The victory of the Sui army this time is a precursor to the early end of the war in northern Sui. Before the outbreak of the Sui war, the power of the Chinese side in northern Sui only reached a few miles south of Bailing Temple and had never actually been in charge. Since recovering Bailing Temple a few days ago, and now capturing Dajiao Temple, the power of the Chinese side has greatly expanded to the north. The revolt of the attacking army has greatly helped the Chinese side. Wang Ying's surrender is currently being negotiated. If Wang revolts, the Mongolian army under De Wang's command will have only 1,500 men left. Dajiao Temple occupies an area of one square mile and has several temples, which can accommodate about 1,000 lamas. (10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

Starting from the 11th, the Social Affairs and Public Security Bureaus will assist in handling the resumption of work. The factories are scheduled to start work on the 14th.

<p>(Qingdao) The Qingdao incident has been generally resolved after several consultations between Shen Honglie and Nishiharu Hiko. It can be announced that it has come to an end after the formalities are completed. However, the withdrawal date of the Japanese marines has not yet been determined. In addition, more than 400 soldiers of the Izumo warship landed with weapons at 3:00 PM on the 10th and went to the shrine to pay their respects. They returned to the ship around 4:00 PM. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) Shen Honglie and Nishiharu Hiko made a concrete decision on the solution to the Qingdao case after meeting on the evening of the 9th. However, no signing method was adopted, only an agreement on the solution was reached. Shen telegraphed the solution to the Central Government for instructions on the 10th.

<h3>King Edward abdicates after less than a year on the throne. The Duke of York succeeds to the throne and is named Albert I. London is dark during the day, and men and women in the council chamber wear black.</h3>
<p>(London) King Edward VIII's abdication decree was read in the House of Commons this afternoon, and his younger brother, the Duke of York, succeeded to the throne and was named Albert I. The constitutional crisis that has shaken the country for a week has come to an end. Edward is now free to marry Mrs. Simpson without any further concerns. The reason for the king's abandonment of honor is Mrs. Simpson.</p>
<p>Edward VIII's reign was very short, which was unprecedented since Queen Jian, who was beheaded in 1554. He succeeded to the throne on January 20 this year after the death of the former King George V, and it has not yet been a year.</p>
<p>The abdication decree was recited by Speaker of the House Fitzroy in an extremely tense atmosphere. At that time, a thick fog filled the outside, making day turn into darkness. The council chamber was brightly lit. The king's three younger brothers were present and listened. The decree stated that the king expressed his gratitude for the appeals from all parties, but "My mind is made up." The House of Commons was crowded today as never before. The entire venue was full. Only Prime Minister Baldwin, Labor Opposition Leader Attlee, and Liberal Leader Sir Sinclair arrived at the venue a little later. There were also no empty seats for the nobles, diplomatic corps, and autonomous territories in the House. Many people could not enter. At the beginning of the meeting, more than 50 questions were raised by the members, all of which were answered quickly. The voices were noisy, so most of the questions and answers could not be heard clearly. And eagerly awaited Prime Minister Baldwin to make an official statement. Most of the members showed impatience with the words of the questions and answers between the two parties. Everyone at the meeting seemed to feel that this meeting was of historical value and of great significance, second only to the outbreak of the World War. At that time, the thick fog outside had dissipated, the sunlight reappeared, and the lights in the House were all turned off. The depressing atmosphere in the entire venue was cleared. All those present, including women, were dressed in black, as if to express the sorrow in their hearts. (10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>King Edward VIII of England</p>
<h3>Speaker of the House reads the abdication decree, cherishing the idea of benefiting the country and the people from now on. Prime Minister Baldwin's face is pale.</h3>
<p>(London) The Prime Minister arrived at the House at 3:35 PM, and the crowd cheered to welcome him. The Prime Minister sat down with an unnatural attitude, holding documents, and whispered to Lord MacDonald, a member of the Privy Council, and Secretary of the Interior Simon, who were sitting on his left and right. The Prime Minister's face was pale, wearing a black short coat, striped trousers, and a black tie. The members' questioning ended at 3:30. At 3:42, the Prime Minister stood up, walked slowly to the railing in front of the members' seats, and announced that he had accepted the decree personally signed by King Edward. Then he handed the decree to the Speaker, who read it in a heavy voice, "After long and deep consideration, I have decided to abandon the throne inherited at the time of my father's death. I now announce this final, firm, and unshakeable decision. I am deeply aware of the importance of this move, and I hope that my people can understand my decision and the reasons why I made it. I do not want to involve my personal emotions, but I earnestly hope that when you recall the burden placed on the shoulders of the monarch, you will realize that it is too heavy and can only be shouldered in an environment different from the one I am in now. I announce in good conscience that I can no longer fulfill this heavy responsibility happily. I put the public interest first. I believe that I have not ignored my responsibilities by doing this. Therefore, I will implement the abdication according to the following text this morning.</p>
<p>I, Edward VIII, hereby announce my unshakeable decision to abandon the throne, myself and my descendants. I hope this abdication decree will take effect immediately. Signed and sealed in the presence of witnesses on December 10, 1936. The name of the witness is attached later. Signed Edward.</p>
<p>My implementation of the abdication is witnessed by my royal brothers, namely the Duke of York, the Duke of Gloucester, and the Duke of Kent. I am deeply grateful for the sincerity shown to me in urging me to take another path. Before making the final decision, I gave full consideration to this request, but my mind is made up and cannot be changed. Furthermore, if this matter is delayed any longer, it will cause great damage to the people whom I serve in the name of the Prince of Wales and then the Emperor, because the prosperity and happiness of the nation's future are always in my heart. My abandonment of my people is in the hope that I will follow the path that I believe to be the right one, namely the path to the security of the throne and the empire, and to the happiness of the people. I am deeply grateful for the love and support that my people have given me before and after I ascended the throne. I know that the people will also give their full support to the new monarch who will succeed me. I sincerely hope that the abdication decree will take effect immediately without any delay, and I sincerely hope that all necessary steps will be taken to ensure that my legal successor, my brother, the Duke of York, will ascend to the throne."

<h3>The English King's marriage storm: Several protagonists are related to Beijing.</h3>
<p>(Beiping) People from all walks of life in Beiping are paying close attention to the English King's marriage storm. Several of the protagonists are well-known to the people in Pingdi. Those who have lived in Ping for a long time should be able to recall Mrs. Spencer, who is today's Mrs. Simpson, who is attracting worldwide attention. The host couple of the villa where Mrs. Simpson is currently residing, the Rogers couple, also lived in Beiping with Mrs. Simpson. Sir Michael, the personal secretary of the Duke of York, who is often seen in newspapers and news, also lived in Ping for many years and served as the personal secretary of Sir John Jordan, the British Minister to China at the time.

<h3>Baldwin's Declaration: Friendship with the King remains the same. No other slips of the tongue occurred after the parting at the palace.</h3>
<p>(London) After the abdication decree of King Edward VIII was read out, Prime Minister Baldwin immediately issued the following declaration: "I now move that the King's decree be considered immediately. I know that the members of the House will sympathize with my position today, so I ask for your understanding of my busyness over the past week, which has left me very little time to draft a speech. Today's words come entirely from sincerity and have no embellishment. What I want to say today is neither criticism nor praise, but a detailed description of the process of my meetings with the King from beginning to end. When the King was the Prince of Wales, he had known me for many years. There was not only friendship between us, but also feelings. When I shook hands with the King at Belville Palace on Tuesday night, we both declared that our friendship had not been damaged in the slightest, but had become closer due to the mutual discussions over the past few weeks. I dare to say that the friendship between the King and me will never be broken in this life." Then he described in detail the process of consultation with the King. (10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) When the Prime Minister left his residence on Downing Street to go to the House of Commons to make the important announcement of the abdication of the King, the police cleared the streets because the people had gathered in front of the residence. When the Prime Minister left the residence, a photographer took a picture for him. The first to see him cheered. As his car drove towards the Parliament, the men waved their hats and the women waved their scarves to show their respect. Although there were one or two catcalls among the crowd, they were drowned out by the cheers. A crowd also gathered in front of Buckingham Palace, making it impossible to pass. Then a large team of police arrived to move the crowd. When the Queen Mother arrived at the Duke of York's mansion at 3:00 PM today, the people who saw her all cheered towards the capital. Today, the government was in a state of tension at Baitang all day long. The telegrams coming from Downing Street in the morning were endless. All newspapers issued special editions, and buyers rushed to be the first to get them. (10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) If the Emperor decides to abdicate, then the abdication decree will be signed, and the Duke of York will inherit the throne. Then he will engage in the legislation regarding this matter. The arrangement of parliamentary affairs and meetings this week is prepared to propose this legislation in both Houses. It may be proposed when the House of Commons meets today, followed by a debate on Friday. If necessary, both Houses can complete the entire matter by the end of the week. The Cabinet held a meeting in the Prime Minister's office in the House of Commons at 7:30 last night to consider the latest situation of the constitutional difficulties. The Cabinet will not hold another meeting before the Prime Minister makes a declaration in the House of Commons today. The Prime Minister had a long talk with the King at the Elville Palace the night before. The entire House of Commons yesterday hoped that the Prime Minister would make a substantive announcement, but the Prime Minister replied to Opposition Leader Attlee, "I cannot say anything more today, but I will be able to make a declaration tomorrow." In view of the turbulent situation and the panic among the people, which has affected business, the Labor Party members asked the Prime Minister not to delay making a substantive declaration any longer. The Leader of the Upper House, Lord Halifax, Lord Privy Seal, said the same thing when answering questions from Lord Snell in the House. The Upper House usually opens at 4:15 PM, but today it will open earlier at 3:45 PM. Friday is usually not a day for meetings, but this week it will also open at 3:00 PM. The instability of the overall situation has also affected the House of Commons itself. Many ordinary questions on the agenda now have no time to be advisors and are put on the back burner. Attlee and Liberal Leader Sir Sinclair both visited the Prime Minister last night. The Prime Minister told them about the latest situation of the crisis. (10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Edward will leave the country tonight, giving up all titles. He should be called "Mr. Windsor".</h3>
<p>(London) After King Edward VIII's abdication decree is passed by the Congress, Da Di will leave the country tomorrow evening. It is reported that the king has given up all titles and will be called "Mr. Windsor" from now on. It is said that there may be a possibility of accepting a dukedom in the future.

<h3>The Duke of York's Mansion is full of tenants. The coronation ceremony is proceeding uninterrupted.</h3>
<p>(London) There were many visitors to the Duke of York's Mansion this morning. The authorities specially dispatched four policemen to guard the mansion to avoid the gathering of idlers. Those responsible said that after the abdication of the king, who will succeed to the throne, whether it is the Duke of York or his daughter Princess Elizabeth, and whether the regency will act on behalf of the state, there are many opinions at this time, and it is still impossible to reach a consensus. Overseas Autonomous Territory Minister Makang MacDonald visited Prime Minister Baldwin at 10:50 this morning to continue the talks, which lasted for a long time. The king's confidant, the prosecutor of the County of Connor, Monkton, and the tax director of the county, Peacock, also brought important documents to the Prime Minister's Office to participate in the talks. As for the king's younger brother, the Duke of Glousster, and the king's fourth brother, the Duke of Cander, they jointly visited the king and had a meeting. (10th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Although the successor has not been officially decided, preparations for the coronation ceremony are still continuing. Most of the workers are busy erecting the stands for viewing the ceremony. Regarding this level, political figures believe that after the death of the monarch, it is customary to wait a year before the new monarch can hold the coronation ceremony to commemorate the national mourning. As for the abdication of the monarch, there is no need to abide by this precedent. In addition, although the people of London have great love for King Edward VIII, since learning that the dispute caused by the marriage problem has been practically resolved, the uneasy mood has been greatly relieved. When the stock exchange opened this morning, the market situation was firm, which shows that financial figures are optimistic. (10th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Baldwin in Further Consultation with Opposition Parties</h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Baldwin invited Major Attlee, chairman of the Labour Party faction in the House of Commons (the opposition party), and Sinclair, chairman of the Liberal Party faction in the opposition party, yesterday afternoon to inform them of the progress of this dispute and the aftermath of the King's abdication. The two informed their respective factions this morning so that they could decide in advance the attitude that their parties should take when the Prime Minister makes a statement to Parliament. In addition, all dominion governments have been notified of the various measures regarding the King's abdication so that these governments can act accordingly. In the House of Commons smoking room, members of Parliament believe that the King's abdication is unavoidable, but they are still commenting on it heatedly. Initially, they were whispering privately, but then they commented openly without any restraint. Some members of Parliament wanted to mediate, while others criticized Prime Minister Baldwin's attitude. However, members of Parliament unanimously expressed their regret that a popular and virtuous monarch like Edward VIII had to relinquish his throne. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<h3>London Public Opinion</h3>
<p>(London) Londoners' street talk and discussions on the constitutional dispute caused by the King's desire to marry Mrs. Simpson are markedly different from the expressions of loyalty to the King last week. Today, a quarter of the people disapprove of the King's actions, while the rest are hesitant in their words. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<h3>George Bernard Shaw Supports the King and Mrs. Simpson</h3>
<p>(London) Humorous writer George Bernard Shaw believes today that if King Edward can insist on his position, he will be able to marry Mrs. Simpson. In that case, there is no basis for the constitutional issues raised by the cabinet. Shaw also does not believe that the dominions oppose this marriage. If the King can marry an American woman, he can also marry a woman from the colonies in the future. Therefore, the cabinet's claim that this marriage cannot be welcomed by the people is arbitrary. Shaw recently discussed the issue of love in the newspapers and received many letters expressing their support. Therefore, he believes that the world supports the King and that the cabinet is acting inappropriately. They do not know that Mrs. Simpson will definitely not accept the position of queen because if she accepts a lower position, the American people will rise up and attack her. As for those who advocate that the King can marry secretly or must marry a princess, it is even more ridiculous. Are there any chaste princesses in this day and age? And why is Mrs. Simpson's lineage inferior to that of a princess? Mrs. Simpson's status is very high in her country. America is a democratic country, and now the democratic system has spread all over the world. It would be extremely foolish to hope that the monarchical power of the past can be restored and democratic countries can be destroyed. Therefore, if the British cabinet does not approve of the King's marriage, it is arrogant and an insult to the United States. "I don't know what attitude the American ambassador to England will take. I'm afraid he will refuse to attend the coronation ceremony," Shaw said. Shaw called the regency proposal foolish. As for the royal family's opposition to the King's marriage, Shaw believes that if the King insists on marrying, the royal family will not be able to do anything about it. However, if the King abdicates, it would be extremely unfortunate. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<h3>On the Eve of the King's Abdication: Non-stop Officials Visiting the Prime Minister's Residence and Royal Palace, Lights Burning Throughout the Night, Messengers Carrying Documents Back and Forth</h3>
<p>(London) Government activity did not stop late at night. The Prime Minister's residence at 10 Downing Street was still brightly lit at 2 AM today. The Prime Minister's staff carried a bundle of documents to the Colonial Office across the street. After midnight yesterday, messengers were still going in and out of the Colonial Office. Sir Inskip, the Secretary of State for Defence and the government's chief legal advisor, stayed in the ministry until about 2 AM today before leaving. Although the weather was cold and foggy, the public still gathered outside the door. At 2:30 AM, several messengers rode motorcycles from Downing Street to Belvedere Palace. The Prime Minister's staff helped one rider attach a black lead-covered box to the bike, with a large red seal on top. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>(London) The person who will inherit the throne is said to have been internally determined, but the authorities have not yet revealed anything. Various dignitaries were very busy last night. At 10:40 PM, two warrant officers arrived at the Prime Minister's residence in Downing Street on motorcycles. They immediately entered the residence and did not leave until 2:30 AM this morning, when they left for Belvedere Palace, carrying an iron box sealed with red sealing wax. What was inside is unknown. The King's confidant, Monckton, Attorney General of the Duchy of Cornwall, hurriedly left the Prime Minister's residence at 11:20 PM last night and returned half an hour later. He did not leave until 12:15 AM this morning. Home Secretary Simon and Sir Peacock, the Receiver General of the Duchy of Cornwall, left the residence at 12:30 AM. At the same time, Dominions Secretary Malcolm MacDonald returned to his ministry from the Prime Minister's residence and continued to meet with Coordination of Defence Minister Inskip. In addition, the King's fourth brother, the Duke of Kent, went to Marlborough House last night at 8 PM to visit Queen Mary. At 10:15 PM, the Duke drove out of the palace in his own car with one passenger, whose identity is unknown. The King's second brother, the Duke of York, left Marlborough House at 12:35 AM this morning. It is generally believed that the King is still at Belvedere Palace, but at around 11 PM last night, a truck loaded with several pieces of luggage was seen driving from the palace to London.

<h3>Church Declaration</h3>
<p>(London) Today, the Church and the Fascist Party issued declarations, the contents of which are noteworthy. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Bishop of Coventry, speaking at the Ramington Diocesan Conference, said, "Under the current circumstances, every hour of delay is an hour of danger. The dispute caused by the marriage issue has caused great damage, causing us all to be ashamed. I had hoped that the current state of unease would be eased, but this hope has not yet become a reality. Therefore, we must continue to pray to God to guide His servant, our King, into the right path. We ourselves should not forget our responsibilities. What is our responsibility? That is, we should not only look at the current dispute from a close and small perspective, but also from a distant and large perspective. The existence of the monarchical system is indeed cherished by us, but we must be careful not to let the idea of loyalty to the monarch exceed the standard of moral judgment. We should be careful not to assume that the King's need for allegiance from his subjects means that his subjects must be loyal. Although we are now deeply ashamed, we are loyal to the monarchical system on the one hand and loyal to our King on the other. It is our duty to firmly believe that the final decision taken by the country, even if it is regrettable to us, must be acceptable to the conscience of the subjects." (Havas)</p>

Observers have different opinions on this matter. Some believe that Goddard's arrival here indicates that the King intends to abdicate in order to finalize the divorce so that he can marry Mrs. Simpson immediately. Others believe that Mrs. Simpson has cancelled her divorce proceedings. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>Cannes, France: Mrs. Simpson's legal counsel, Goddard, accompanied by his secretary, Baron, and Dr. Kirkwood, flew here today from Croydon, London, on a mysterious plane, carrying three large suitcases and a document case. When asked, Goddard replied, "I cannot discuss my client's affairs. The purpose of this trip is to discuss her London affairs with Mrs. Simpson." Goddard had a long talk with Mrs. Simpson today and plans to stay here for several days to meet with her at any time. At the same time, according to Mrs. Simpson's friends, Mrs. Simpson is currently living in seclusion in the village and seems to be in good spirits. It is reported that Mrs. Simpson has brought most of her valuable jewelry here, many of which were given to her by the King, so she took out special insurance when passing through France. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) It is generally expected that King Edward VIII will depart for Cannes in southern France today to meet with Mrs. Simpson.

<p>(London) Kirkpatrick, the representative of the Export Credits Guarantee Department in China, departed for Marseilles today with his wife. They plan to board the P&amp;O liner, Rawalpindi, to go to China to take up his new post. Guo Taiqi, the Chinese Ambassador to the UK, had left for Geneva earlier today, so Dr. Chen Weicheng, who is in charge of acting on his behalf, went to Victoria Station to see him off.

Since taking on this position, I have received an endless stream of letters from all over the UK inquiring and offering suggestions. News from China is also of a very welcome nature. At the same time, you should know that my trip to China is not to indiscriminately release funds. Every suggestion will be studied purely from a business perspective. I will strive to ensure that any project requesting assistance and the source of funding are solid and without regrets. Based on this foundation, I dare to conclude that there is great business to be done between China and the UK." Accompanying Kirkpatrick is Thorne, an economic advisor from the Export Credits Guarantee Department. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador to Russia Meets with Russian Foreign Minister; Discusses Pending Issues Between the Two Countries; Demands Withdrawal of Troops Stationed in the Far East</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Ambassador Shigemitsu to Russia, acting on instructions from the Japanese government, is scheduled to meet with Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov today. According to international practice, after a newly appointed ambassador presents his credentials, he first exchanges views on general issues between the two countries when he meets with the foreign minister of the host country. Ambassador Shigemitsu also intends to follow this practice, starting with general diplomatic issues and gradually addressing various pending issues, that is, Ambassador Shigemitsu intends to first express the Japanese government's desire to maintain friendly relations between Japan and Russia, explain the inappropriate nature of the Soviet Union's deployment of a large army in the Far East, and explain the purpose of the Japan-Germany agreement. Finally, he will present the Japanese government's views on the following issues: (1) Promoting the signing of the Japan-Russia Fisheries Treaty; (2) The issue of the release of Japanese arrested on suspicion of espionage; (3) The establishment of a committee to handle border disputes and a committee to demarcate the border; (4) The issue of the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the Far East.

<h3>Soviet Union Emphasizes Defense Industry; Newly Established Committee</h3>
<p>(Moscow) After the Soviet Central Executive Committee decided to establish a National Defense Industry Committee, newspapers here uniformly praised it. Pravda said, "Our national defense industry was created by Stalin single-handedly and is the same as our party and government. Because Stalin always pays attention to the power of national defense, the Soviet Union has today countless 'fearless' tanks, giant aircraft capable of carrying dozens of tons into the sky, long-range cannons, high-speed torpedo boats, submarines, and army infantry and weapons, etc." Our aviation industry, tank industry, and all military technologies are completely new creations. In Stalin's two five-year plans, our national defense industry has become a strong and complete organization and has all the conditions for continued development. The natural result of the development of our entire industry, especially the defense industry, is the establishment of the National Defense Industry Committee. In order to make military technology develop more rapidly and to make defense tools more complete, it is necessary to have a separate organization for the National Defense Industry Committee. Therefore, the establishment of this committee is timely. (TASS)</p>
<h3>Pacific Defense Issues; No Response from the US and Japan</h3>
<p>(London) The Washington Naval Treaty will expire at the end of this year. Regarding Article 19 of the treaty, which stipulates that "the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan agree to maintain the status quo of the coastal defenses and naval bases of their respective possessions and territories in the Pacific Ocean, and not to add to them except as specified in the treaty," the British government inquired with the United States and Japan in October as to whether it could be renewed in order to continue to be effective. It also suggested that the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan hold negotiations in the near future to make a final decision. However, as of now, the US and Japanese governments have not yet submitted a formal response. The British government is quite anxious because the treaty is about to expire. It has now instructed its ambassadors to the US and Japan to urge the authorities in Washington and Tokyo to respond as soon as possible. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of the Navy Swanson announced today that the United States cannot immediately proceed with the fortification of Pacific islands because Congress has not yet allocated funds. However, it is difficult to say what will happen in the future. Negotiations between the UK, the US, and Japan on this matter have not been made clear. As for the huge floating dock built by the United States, it will follow the fleet and is not intended to be sent to the Philippines. That is, the US Navy fleet will not be transferred to the Philippines at present. It should be noted that the Philippines is in the process of completing its independence, and the United States only retains certain naval privileges over it. (National Telegram, 4th)</p>

<h3>The British Throne Issue</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>In a turbulent world, the British Empire is the greatest force for stability. Within this great British Empire, the royal family is the only unifying element. Unfortunately, in recent years, the leadership of the British Empire in the world has gradually declined. And more unfortunately, at a time when the British Empire most needs unity, the prestige of the royal family has inevitably been shaken due to the King's marriage issue. The unity of the British people and the connection between the various parts of the British Empire are tending to weaken. We should not treat this personal marriage issue merely as a romantic story because the impact of this matter is not limited to one corner of Britain but concerns the well-being of the entire world.</p>
<p>The King in British practical politics, on the surface, has no power and is insignificant because the great powers granted to the emperor by the customary constitution are almost entirely exercised by the cabinet, and the cabinet is responsible to Parliament, which is indirectly responsible to the people of the whole country. However, it is a mistake to regard the King as being the same as the presidents of various countries such as France and the Soviet Union because the King has his lofty and important functions and roles, and Edward VIII is not allowed to freely marry an American beauty who has been divorced twice to be his queen. First, the King represents the unified country and is the sole representative of the country. Although the Prime Minister actually bears the great administrative power, he is the leader of the party. His term of office is indefinite. He does not have a fixed image or religiously tinged love in the minds of the people of the whole country. In times of national crisis, the king is needed to come out to solve problems and resolve disputes. The clear example of this is that in 1931, former King George ignored constitutional rules and appointed MacDonald to organize a national unity cabinet.</p>
<p>Second, the King is the supreme commander of the British army, navy, and air force. Every British soldier swears allegiance to the King when he enlists. Although this is a formality and not a real power, the King is the symbol of the country and the focal point of the soldiers' loyalty and bravery. Without this center, or if the soldiers' confidence in this idol is shaken, it will have a great impact on the morale of the army. Third, the King and Queen are the highest role models in British society and the epitome of the world's highest honor because they receive the world's greatest respect. Therefore, they can exert great influence in both domestic and international politics, especially for countries with a deep sense of honor. If they receive the King's visit even once, they will feel great honor. British customs, habits, and moral standards all use the King and Queen as role models. Changing customs and habits is fast and effective. In the past, British newspapers used modern photography and the vivid writing of journalists to create an image of the King and Queen as omniscient, omnipotent, perfect, and flawless in the minds of the people. Now, the British people have discovered that they are making the American woman they despise the most, who has been divorced, their queen. This is, of course, a great disappointment.</p>
<p>However, the most important task of the King lies in maintaining the unity of the entire British Empire. The various dominions of the British Empire are already equal to independence in fact. The laws of the London Parliament cannot govern Canada or Australia. The only unifying element of this empire, which includes many nationalities, many religions, and many different political systems, is that all the people of the empire are subject to the King and are loyal to the King. Therefore, the British call the royal family the "golden chain of the empire." In recent years, the degree of autonomy of countries such as Canada, Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand has increased day by day, and their interests have gradually become inconsistent with those of Britain. They have their own diplomats, their own armies and navies, and their own parliaments and governments. However, their loyalty to the royal family is increasing day by day. Whenever members of the royal family go to the various dominions, they are warmly welcomed by the local people, who shout "Long live the King." Having an emperor in Britain is truly the most valuable tool for maintaining the unity of the empire. No political scientist can think of a better system to unite the British people and territories spread across the five continents on one center. However, the various parts of the empire are not willing to have the woman they revere as a sacred queen be an American woman who has been divorced twice, and whose two ex-husbands are still alive. Therefore, the representatives of the current autonomous states are actively opposed to the marriage. From a common-sense point of view, their opposition is not without reason.</p>
<p>Therefore, the marriage of Edward VIII and Mrs. Simpson is not a personal issue, nor is it a local issue in Britain, but a matter concerning the unity and disintegration of the British Empire, as well as the increase or decrease in the forces for world peace and stability. According to historians, before the Great War in Europe, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria married Sophie Chotek, a woman of low status, against the wishes of the royal family. This incident had a considerable cause-and-effect relationship with the European Great War. There are clear examples in Chinese and foreign history of international politics changing due to women. The current marriage issue between the British King and Mrs. Simpson cannot be taken lightly. According to recent news, the King has announced his abdication. This decisive action is beneficial to the future of Britain.</p>
<h3>Bad Weather in Spain; No Fighting on Any Front Lines; Both Sides' Aircraft Conduct Aerial Reconnaissance; Government Troops Occupy Key Town in the North</h3>

<h3>Anglo-Italian Negotiations Proceeding Smoothly</h3>
<p>(London) Negotiations between Britain and Italy regarding the gentleman's agreement to be established on Mediterranean issues are proceeding very smoothly. Officials declared that this agreement could open a new path for the friendly relations between Britain and Italy. Therefore, certain key issues, such as Italy's anti-British propaganda on the radio, must be resolved in advance.

<h3>英法邀德意俄葡　調解西班牙內戰　係教廷與美國所發起　此後辦法分三步進行</h3>
<p>(London) The British Foreign Office announced today that the British and French governments, regarding the situation caused by the prolongation of the Spanish Civil War and the danger to European peace, exchanged opinions last week and decided to invite the governments of Germany, Italy, Portugal, and Soviet Russia to jointly announce with Britain and France their determination to strictly prohibit all direct and indirect actions to avoid foreign intervention in the Spanish Civil War. They also requested the four governments to notify their representatives in the London Non-Intervention Committee for the Spanish Civil War of their opinions on this proposal, so that an effective administrative body can be established as soon as possible for the various seaports of Spain. The British and French governments also invited Italy, Germany, Portugal, and Russia to join hands with them in the spirit of humanitarianism to end the Spanish Civil War through mediation and to enable the entire Spanish nation to make a united expression of its national aspirations.

<p>(Paris) Germany, Italy, and Portugal have decided to grant ample time for consideration regarding the British government's proposal to mediate the Spanish civil unrest. This proposal was apparently initiated by the Holy See, the United States, and other American republics. The initiators intend to proceed in three stages: (1) Mediation by the major powers, (2) A truce, (3) Holding a Spanish plebiscite. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Observers here believe that the Anglo-French proposal is very timely because the Council of the League of Nations will soon convene a temporary meeting on the Spanish issue. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Soviet Ambassador to France Potemkin recently visited Foreign Minister Delbos and personally delivered a note from the Soviet government, stating that the Soviet government expresses its complete acceptance of the Anglo-French proposal for joint action to end the Spanish Civil War. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Foreign Minister Delbos recently received Italian Ambassador to France Cerruti and discussed the Anglo-French proposal to mediate the Spanish Civil War.

<p>(Rome) The British and French governments recently jointly submitted a note to the four countries of Italy, Germany, Portugal, and Russia, advocating that direct and indirect intervention in the Spanish Civil unrest should be stopped. Political figures here are deeply skeptical of the results that can be obtained from this move.</p>
<p>(London) The Non-Intervention Committee for the Spanish Civil Unrest recently held a plenary session and immediately passed the report submitted by the subcommittee. The report proposes two measures: (1) Measures to prevent various indirect acts of intervention in the Spanish Civil War; (2) Measures to prohibit volunteers from various countries from enlisting in Spain and passing through to Spain. During today's discussion of the report by the Coordinating Committee, the Italian and German representatives raised reservations on the above two proposals, saying that they could only agree in principle, and that specific measures should be referred to their respective governments for instructions. It is reported that German Ambassador to the UK Ribbentrop recently returned to London after returning home, and today was the first time he represented Germany at the committee. He briefly stated that if the prohibition of volunteers from various countries from going to Spain is handled separately from the overall issue of indirect intervention in the civil unrest, it may not be acceptable to the German government. Ribbentrop further insisted that there are more than 35,000 Soviet people in Spain, as well as many Soviet officers and military assistants who are training volunteers in Spain. Subsequently, Soviet Ambassador to the UK Maisky refuted, severely criticizing the representatives of Italy, Germany, and Portugal, saying that in the past three months, the representatives of the three countries had repeatedly received instructions from their respective governments to prevent the work of the Coordination Committee from achieving practical results. Maisky then refuted Ribbentrop's claim that Soviet volunteers went to Spain to enlist, saying that there are 6,000 German soldiers fighting on the side of the Spanish Nationalist Army, all of whom are fully armed. The recent repeated defeats of the Nationalist Army have made Italy and Germany feel the need to intervene. Maisky further stated that he hoped that Italy and Germany would not go too far, otherwise, not only would victory be difficult to achieve, but they would also inevitably suffer losses. These words were like a warning to Italy and Germany. Finally, Maisky added that so-called volunteers should be distinguished from the "International Brigades," which are composed of political exiles from Italy and Germany, as well as people from France, Britain, Poland, and other countries, who voluntarily go to Spain to resist the Italian and German troops participating on the side of the Nationalist Army. These troops are shipped from Italian and German ports to Spain on Italian and German ships. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<h3>德國要求　殖民地重行分配　解決困難唯一途徑　世界和平庶幾可期</h3>
<p>(Berlin) German Economic Minister Dr. Schacht delivered a speech today at the centennial celebration of the Geographical Statistical Association held in Frankfurt, saying that the distribution of colonies is indeed a way to solve the current world problems. Schacht has long advocated that Germany must recover its colonies as a step towards Germany's return to world trade and political peace. At present, Germany does not have enough land to accommodate its population, and it also needs territory to supply raw materials and necessary food. The conclusion of a mere trade agreement cannot guarantee the security of Germany's existence, so the distribution of colonies is the only solution to the current difficulties. Schacht also said that it is ridiculous that the British side does not approve of Germany's proposal to recover its colonies, because Britain itself is the largest colonial country in the world. Schacht continued that some foreign countries have said that Germany's pre-war colonies were a loss to the motherland and had no benefit, and that even if Germany could recover all its pre-war colonies, it would probably not be able to solve Germany's economic problems. Both of these statements are incorrect, because the situation before the war is very different from today. At that time, Germany's resources from overseas trade reached 30,000,000,000 gold marks, but today everything has changed. In addition, Germany's former colonies currently export an amount of oil that is one-fourth of Germany's annual needs, and the situation in the timber industry is the same. All of the above is true and not an exaggeration. In short, the peace of Europe and the world depends on whether the crowded population of Central Europe can find a way out. (Reuters, 9th)</p>

<h3>英日航業競爭　英宜亟謀補救之道</h3>
<p>(London) The British Shipping Company held its annual shareholders' meeting today. Chairman Shaw Alexander presented a report, stating that Japanese shipping in the East is gradually surpassing Britain. In terms of shipping costs from Bombay to Japan, Japanese ships carry 80% to 89% of the total commercial transport volume. At present, the tonnage of Japanese ships can carry twice the total amount of their own country's goods, but they still do not consider it enough and continue to build merchant ships. Britain should catch up quickly in order to remedy the situation. If it continues to muddle along, the shipping industry of the British Empire will inevitably decline. (Havas Agency, 9th)</p>

(2) Taking the people as the premise, eliminate corruption, suppress bandits, and abolish harsh taxes, with the main goal of making the people live and work in peace and contentment. (3) Taking the facts as the premise, I always tell the truth, do practical things, and overthrow dependence and hypocrisy in order to save the country. (4) Taking the suppression of communism as the premise, communism is a heresy that confuses the world and is completely incompatible with the national conditions. The territory of Hebei and Chahar must be thoroughly purged. The above four points are the facts of the past and also the policies for the future. (Special Dispatch, 10th)</p>

<h3>行政院研究　整理地籍辦法　擬定綱要四點</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) In order to understand the local financial situation, the Executive Yuan previously sent personnel to investigate. According to the report, the most common phenomenon in the finances of various provinces is that income does not meet expenditure, and it is difficult to administer expenses. Most provinces use borrowing, requesting central assistance, and additional taxes to balance the budget. As a result, debt fees become higher, the people's burden becomes heavier, and the financial foundation becomes more unstable. The Executive Yuan has recently actively planned a way out of the financial situation and has invited economic experts such as Fang Xianting to the Yuan to study. It is reported that those familiar with finance in the Yuan said that the largest source of local income in our country is the land tax. According to the general calculation of local provinces and cities in 1935, the land tax is always in the first place. However, in recent years, there are still many accumulated malpractices in the land tax. The crux of the matter is that the land registry is not accurate. As a result, concealment, hidden ownership, and excessive demands are impossible to prevent. If the land registry is properly organized, hidden land can be eliminated and the tax can be increased. The phenomenon of having grain but no land, and having land but no grain can be avoided. The central government had previously ordered the provinces to conduct consolidation from all aspects, such as surveying, clearing, and reporting, but the results were minimal due to the lack of technology, experience, and funding. The Executive Yuan is now planning to study a method of organizing the land registry that is suitable for current needs and easy to organize. The outline is: (1) The provincial government should formulate and report, raise funds, train personnel, divide districts, and select dates, etc. (2) The county government should train cadres, personnel, investigate customs, publicize organizations, etc. (3) Formulate and report procedures. (4) Reform the collection regulations. (Central News Agency, 10th)</p>

<h3>Amidst Calls for a Truce, the North China Economic Development Issue: Li Enhao Meets with Tashiro and Horiuchi in Tianjin, the Japanese Side Plans to Purchase More Salt and Improve Cotton Production</h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Li Enhao came to Tianjin from Peiping on the 4th of this month. At 10:00 AM on the 5th, he visited Ikeda, the third section chief of the Japanese Garrison Army in North China, to exchange views on economic cooperation. The discussion lasted a long time. At 10:00 AM on the 6th, he visited the Japanese Commander Tashiro in Zhangwei again, to discuss for about 20 minutes based on what he had discussed with Ikeda. Ikeda originally planned to invite Li to continue the discussion at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 7th, but it did not happen due to some matters. Li then visited the Japanese Consul General Horiuchi in Tianjin in the afternoon, and also talked for some time. In the afternoon, he hurried back to Peiping to report. Recently, the North China economic development issue has gradually been ignored by the Chinese people since the outbreak of the Suiyuan War. The Hebei-Chahar authorities believe that this matter was initiated by the Japanese side, and the Chinese side is in a passive position. At this time when the people of the whole country are heartbroken about the North China issue, if the other side does not come to talk, the Chinese side would not be able to take the initiative. Therefore, Li Sihao has not made any formal contacts after traveling south and returning north. On the Japanese Army Command side, the North China Sino-Japanese navigation incident has already been realized, and the construction of the Tianjin-Shijiazhuang Railway is also a settled agreement. However, since the Suiyuan War is tense, all attention is focused on matters related to it, and there are still concerns about being inadequate. Therefore, the economic cooperation issue has been postponed a step. Until recently, the military leaders inside and outside the Guan held consultations on the Suiyuan issue, and the plan has been decided. The Command has therefore continued to pay attention to economic cooperation matters. Li Sihao came to Tianjin this time at the invitation of the Command. It is heard that the result of the talks was only an exchange of opinions on the surface, and no concrete measures were agreed upon. Combining the intentions of the Japanese Army Command and the Japanese Consulate General, they attach great importance to the export of Lu salt and the improvement of cotton, believing that these two items should be carried out after the Tianjin-Shijiazhuang Railway and the Longyan Mine. Li Sihao expressed the Chinese side's opinion, arguing that the Hebei-Chahar Political Committee is willing to accept the export of Lu salt in principle, because the increased sales of salt can bring profits to the salt fields, but the methods must be discussed in detail to ensure that they are meticulous. First, the price must be higher than this year's export salt price, and second, the exported salt cannot be resold to the coastal areas of China. As long as the number of exports does not affect the Chinese people's food supply, the Japanese side can purchase a large quantity. Regarding cotton improvement, if the supply of seeds and technical cooperation are provided, they are also willing to accept it in principle. However, technical assistance should not hinder Chinese sovereignty or undermine the Chinese rural system as a prerequisite. The Japanese side believes that the Chinese side's expressions are all appropriate and have been studied by Ikeda, Ogiwara, etc. However, from the Chinese side's observation, both of the above items are not easy to achieve. Moreover, since the funds have not been properly raised, empty talk will still be difficult to put into practice.</p>
<p>A Japanese company had previously proposed to expand its capital by 100 million yuan to shoulder the economic development front, but later reduced it to 50 million yuan due to difficulties in raising funds. However, its president, Sogawa, and Mantetsu director Sakatani, returned to their country to carry out activities, but the financial groups are still extremely indifferent, and very few are willing to invest and cooperate. The company then had another proposal to issue 50 million bonds, but due to the difficult times and the difficulty in selling, it was again proposed that Mantetsu should invest half of the funds, and the rest should still be raised from the private sector. In addition, the puppet Manchukuo Datong Company will be merged into it to form a "Manchuria" Chinese private integrated economic enterprise to carry out all plans, which is planned to be realized next spring, and then develop the North China economy according to the steps.

<h3>A Certain Country's Tiger's Paw: A Bandit Caught in the Fujian-Guangdong Border, Remnant Bandits in Baxian Mountain Receiving Supplies from a Certain Country, Garrison Troops Destroy Bandit Nest, Obtained Much Evidence</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The remnant bandits in Raoping, Dabu, Zhao'an, Pinghe, Yunxiao, Yongding and other counties under the jurisdiction of Chaozhou and Meizhou have long been exploited, with conspiratorial intentions. These remnant bandits rely on their background and lurk in the coastal areas of the Fujian-Guangdong border, such as the fishing villages in Fushan District, Longyan City in Huanggang District of Raoping, Yanshang, Shiyun, and Zhangxi in Dabu. The local people are greatly disturbed and robbed, and the good people have moved away one after another. Among the bandits, it is heard that 700-800 remnant bandits such as Zhang Dingcheng and Li Tianhui are entrenched in Xianghu Mountain, the junction of Pinghe, Dabu, and Raoping. The bandits such as Yu Dingren, Yang Wuguo, and Chen Jinfang are entrenched in Baxianling and Wushan areas, the junction of Raoping and Zhao'an. Zhang Changshui's remnants are led by Wu Jin and are entrenched in Daba Mountain and Pingshui in Yunxiao and Nanjing. There are also more than 20 other groups of four or five people who gather in the deep mountains and often take advantage of the garrison's unpreparedness to suddenly loot the villages. The firearms they use are all the latest type, manufactured by a certain country. In order to suppress the bandits, the Chaozhou-Shantou garrison specially sent Kong Kequan's brigade to Raoping, with Tan's camp stationed in Fushan District, guarding the border crossings of Fujian, and Chen Qianqi's regiment guarding Yanshang and Zhangxi. Last month, they first defeated the Zhang and Li bandits in Xianghu Mountain. At the beginning of this month, they agreed with the Zhao'an garrison to search the bandit nest in Baxian Mountain. Tan's camp first sent plainclothes teams into the mountain to investigate the terrain of the mountain, and then sent troops to enter the mountain in two routes. The Zhao'an defense army blocked the rear of the mountain. At noon on the 2nd, they unexpectedly attacked the bandit's main camp, captured 32 bandits alive, and escorted them back to the Fushan camp headquarters for interrogation. It is heard that more than 200 remnant bandits fled down the mountain with their weapons when they saw the troops coming. The one stationed in the mountain was the pseudo-military 5th Detachment. The captured squad leader Zhang Xitian confessed that he had repeatedly robbed the fishing villages, and there was an international secret background that was inconvenient to publicize. Among the captured bandits, 23 were from Jingkeng, Zhao'an. Two agencies were destroyed in the mountain, and dozens of new-style guns and artillery of a certain country similar to those in Suidong were seized, as well as radio and communication symbols with a certain party. The bandit nest was immediately burned.</p>

<h3>Hebei Province Increases the Number of Security Teams, the Security Department Sends Personnel to Reorganize the Province's Local Militias, Establishing Two Brigades of Security Teams to Defend the Locality</h3>
<p>Baoding Correspondence: In order to consolidate local security and enhance the self-defense capabilities of the people in each county, the Hebei-Chahar Political Committee specially ordered Zhang Yunrong, Director of the Hebei Provincial Security Department, and Gao Shuxun, Deputy Director, to be responsible for reorganizing the security teams throughout the province and to properly plan permanent measures to strengthen the province's defense. After receiving the order, Zhang and Gao immediately began to carry out the work and sent personnel to each county to inspect and verify them one by one. The Security Department also drafted a pre-determined reorganization plan and standards, which were carried by the inspectors and carefully screened during the inspection. All the old, weak, disabled soldiers and those with addictions were immediately eliminated, and strong and healthy recruits were added. Then, the leaders of the security teams in each county were summoned to the province for training. The Security Department hired specialized personnel to teach them the methods of training and managing the troops. After the training was completed, they returned to their counties to train their subordinates in practice. Now, the security teams in each county have been reorganized and are in good condition, and they all meet the predetermined standards. All firearms and weapons have also been replenished. The funds for the teams are centrally managed and distributed by the provincial treasury, and they have reached the standard of sound capabilities. Recently, the special commissioner of the Security Department personally inspected the counties and believed that the defense within the territory has been strengthened. The winter defense in Hebei Province has already begun, and the joint defense between the counties has also been completed. However, Hebei Province is vast and the number of troops stationed in Hebei is limited. The area south of Hebei has long been the origin of banditry, and the deep mountains of northern Henan have always been areas where bandits are entrenched. Although Ma Shibin, commander of the 9th Security District, and Chen Huafu's brigade of Feng Zhian's troops, are stationed in Daming, Yongnian, Qingfeng, and other areas, which are sufficient to suppress them, it is recently learned that the authorities have transferred Cheng Xixian, former director of the Tianjin Municipal Public Security Bureau, to be the brigade commander of the 1st Hebei Security Brigade, and Gao Shuxun, deputy director of the Security Department, to be the brigade commander of the 2nd Security Brigade, in order to expand the local self-defense capabilities and assist in the security of the locality.

<h3>Songjiang: Songcheng Air Defense Drill</h3>
<p>The Songjiang Branch of the Air Defense Association, with the approval of the authorities, has scheduled an air defense drill for the 11th and 12th. The program has been determined and will be widely publicized by the Baojia chiefs in advance.</p>
<h3>Change of District Head in the Fifth District</h3>
<p>Ye Lizhuo, the District Head of the 9th District of this county, has resigned with the approval of the county government after serving for two years. The county government has selected Ye Lilin to succeed him and has submitted it to the Department of Civil Affairs for approval. The department has ordered the official to go to the department for training within two weeks. The county government has ordered the official to comply.</p>
<h3>Order to Investigate Public Property</h3>
<p>The estates of childless households, abandoned ancestral halls, and public sites in the districts of this county have not been investigated for a long time. It is inevitable that some have been occupied and converted into private property. Now, in order to carry out local public welfare and start undertakings beneficial to the people, the county government has ordered each district to order the township chiefs to investigate and report them, so as to comprehensively plan and carefully examine the needs and situation of each district, design and implement them, and benefit the society.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Yutai Yarn Factory Resumes Production</h3>
<p>The Yutai Yarn Factory in Zhitang Town, the fifth district, which has been closed for several years, resumed production on the 10th. The factory is large-scale and is the crown of the factories here. It employs more than 2,000 male and female workers, who work in two shifts, day and night. It produces more than 30 pieces of yarn per day. According to reports, the Yutai Factory was founded by Zhu Douwen, a wealthy businessman from Anhui. Later, due to losses, it was leased to the Shatou Litai Yarn Factory and renamed Litai Second Factory. It was closed again in 1934.</p>
<h3>Changshu's Newspapers Raise Prices</h3>
<p>The five newspapers here, including Xinsheng Bao and Qin Bao, have raised their prices for the sale of newspapers from the 10th. The actual selling price of each newspaper is 2 cents in national currency. All subscription fees have been changed to monthly settlements, and fees are collected monthly. In the past half month, the price of newsprint here has suddenly risen from several jiao per ream to 5.6 yuan, and there are often shortages. The rising trend has no end in sight.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Flour, Wheat, and Bean Prices Soar</h3>
<p>The wheat market in this county has been rising steadily because the stocks in each store are very low. From autumn to winter, the source of supply is very scarce, and the sales of each factory have been very good, resulting in rising prices. Each bag has reached 11 yuan or so. It is a rising trend that has not been seen in decades. In addition, the market price of flour is also rising steadily. Each bag of Green Barracks flour costs 4.26 yuan. In addition, the market price of soybeans is also firm. On the 9th, each stone of Kai Du yellow soybeans sold for 8.5 yuan, and each stone of Liao Jia Zhou yellow soybeans sold for 8.4 yuan. There is no sign that the prices of the above goods will stop rising.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Murder of Husband Case Solved</h3>
<p>Zhu Aqi, a 35-year-old resident of Liu Sanxiang village, Jiaoxi Township, Wu County, married a woman surnamed Gu in the past. They had a son and a daughter. In recent years, Aqi developed a carbuncle on his waist and became physically weak, which led to a cold relationship between the couple. In recent months, Gu had an affair with Zhu Heshang, a fellow villager. When Aqi discovered this, Gu felt very inconvenient. On the 6th of this month, she and her lover Zhu Heshang sneaked into the bedroom and, taking advantage of Aqi's deep sleep, Zhu Heshang used both hands to strangle Aqi's throat. Gu covered his mouth and nose with a cotton coat, causing him to die instantly. The next morning, Gu claimed that her husband had died of illness. The deceased's brother, Mengsheng, entered and carefully examined his younger brother, finding numerous finger marks on his neck. He became suspicious and interrogated his sister-in-law in every possible way. Only then did he learn about the above situation. He immediately restrained the lover Zhu Heshang and Gu, and reported it to the Jiaoxi Township patrol team, which dispatched police to escort them to the Zheng Luqiao Public Security Fourth Sub-station. On the 9th, the Public Security Bureau transferred them to the local court's prosecutor's office for interrogation. They confessed to the murder in detail, as if recounting a series of events. They were ordered to be detained. On the morning of the 10th, personnel were dispatched to the countryside to conduct an on-site inspection for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin: Taiyu Wanted Criminal Refuses Arrest</h3>
<p>Huang Heyuan from Taiyu, formerly a squad leader in the fort defense camp, had a fellow villager, Li Zhensheng, serving as a soldier under him. Li had deserted twice. This spring, he robbed a child surnamed someone of a gold necklace in Taixing and committed murder. The county government offered a reward of 500 yuan for his arrest. Li was currently at his mistress's place in Lijiashi. Huang lured him to Liu Delin's home in Yujia Chang outside the North Gate. On the 7th, it was reported to the First Branch Bureau, and he was arrested and escorted to the county for interrogation and detention, awaiting Taiyu County to come to Cheng to take him into custody.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Abundant Hairtail Season Along the Coast</h3>
<p>The coastal areas of northern Jiangsu and the fishing grounds of the Shengsi Islands have now entered the peak season for hairtail fishing in winter. Fishing boats have already set sail. After a heavy snowfall on the sea surface on the 7th, the weather has turned mild, and the harvest has been very abundant. In addition to dispatching patrol teams to sea to protect fishermen, the Third District Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Maritime Public Security Bureau has also deployed the Haiying Jun and police warships to patrol.</p>
<h3>Land Tax Consolidation in Progress</h3>
<p>The land tax in Tongyi has always been characterized by fraudulent names and entrusted estates. The current consolidation is extremely difficult. It has been decided to thoroughly reform after the completion of land registration throughout the county. Currently, restrictions on grain transfer are being implemented, uniformly using the household registration of district, township, and baojia.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Huangyan Tangerines Sell Well</h3>
<p>Due to the prolonged drought, the harvest of Huangyan tangerines this year has been reduced. The Fenglin Improvement Farm Horticulture Farm of Zhejiang Province has cooperated with the Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry to improve packaging for preservation and facilitate transportation and sales. The International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry is responsible for promotion. More than a thousand boxes have been transported from Huangyan to Shanghai and have been continuously sold out. Sales are brisk. Prices range from three to four yuan to seven to eight yuan per box, depending on the grade.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan: Vegetable Prices Rise After Snow</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of autumn, Xiaoshan has experienced dry weather. Fortunately, the autumn harvest was not affected. However, the radish, the only vegetable needed for winter consumption, has had a poor harvest due to the prolonged drought. After snowfall on the night of the 5th, more snow fell on the afternoon of the 6th, but it stopped after less than two hours. However, there was still the appearance of heavy snow. Due to the lack of water during the severe cold, vegetable prices in the market have soared, doubling in the past day or two. Prices may continue to rise in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Salt Smugglers Brutally Kill Salt Police</h3>
<p>In Ronggui Township, the Seventh District of Xiaoshan, a salt policeman named Han was recently brutally murdered by salt smugglers Xu Huixian, Shen Shunfa, and others, and thrown into the river滩. Because the corpse had been decaying for a long time, it was difficult to identify. The township police reported to the county for an autopsy. The county government dispatched detectives to investigate the truth and apprehended six salt smugglers, including Xu Huixian, who were sent to the court for interrogation. They confessed to the crime and have been prosecuted and will be punished according to law.</p>
<h3>Ningbo: Remitting Donations to Save the Nation</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Self-Salvation Donation Day Sports Meet, all sectors have enthusiastically donated. In addition to the first batch of over 600 yuan already remitted, another 6,000 yuan was remitted on the 8th, transferred by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications to Beijing for central verification, collection, and transfer.</p>
<h3>Power Outage Lasts More Than Ten Hours</h3>
<p>At around 8 p.m. on the 7th, the Yongyao Power Company in this city experienced a sudden rupture of more than a dozen water pipes connected to the boiler, causing a power outage and plunging the entire city into darkness. The cause of the rupture was that the prolonged drought caused the water to have high salt content, leading to rust and corrosion inside the pipes. The company had spare water pipes, but the high temperature of the ruptured part prevented workers from entering to work. Water had to be poured on it to cool it down before repairs could begin. Therefore, the entire city was dark that night, and it was difficult to restore power until dawn. After the incident, the public security authorities, fearing that petty criminals would take the opportunity to act, dispatched extra police teams to patrol all night to prevent accidents. The repair work was not completed until the afternoon of the 8th.</p>

<h3>General Huang Qixiang Returns to China Yesterday at the Invitation of Chairman Chiang. Talks About His Inspection of Military Affairs in Various Countries. Feels That National Affairs are Urgent and Comes to Serve.</h3>
<p>Huang Qixiang, a former famous general of the Guangdong Army, has been abroad for many years. At the invitation of Chairman Chiang, he hurriedly returned to China yesterday morning at 11 a.m. aboard the German postal ship "Scharnhorst," docking at the Gonghexiang Wharf on East Broadway Road. Wu Tiecheng, the mayor of this city, specially dispatched Li Dachao, a section chief of the municipal government, and Yang Hu, the commander of the Songhu Garrison, sent his secretary Wang Zhinan as representatives to welcome him at the ship.</p>
<p>Visiting Wu and Yang</p>
<p>After disembarking, Huang first drove to Hague Road to visit Mayor Wu, then visited Commander Yang, and then went to the Cangzhou Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road to rest. That evening, he attended a banquet hosted by his former subordinates in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Huang's Speech</p>
<p>A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency visited him at his lodging and was granted an audience. According to him, he has been abroad for three years, spending most of his time in Germany, residing in Berlin. He has also visited various Western European countries such as England, France, Italy, Belgium, Switzerland, and the Netherlands, but has not crossed to America or visited Soviet Russia. His purpose cannot be said to be military inspection, but rather a personal feeling of lacking knowledge, seeking further education. Now, in view of the country's many affairs and the urgency of foreign aggression, he had no choice but to temporarily abandon his aspiration for further education and return to the country to serve. After arriving in Shanghai, he has telegraphed Chairman Chiang to report and will visit him after an appointment is made. He will stay in Shanghai for a few days.</p>
<p>Military Affairs of Various Countries</p>
<p>Regarding the military affairs of various countries, what I have been able to witness is only the external appearance. The inner workings each have their secrets, which outsiders cannot observe. What our country can imitate is not the system, but the technology. The national conditions are different, and the systems cannot be the same, but the increasing mechanization of the military affairs of various countries and the technology are what our country should catch up with urgently. I also have a feeling from staying in Europe, that is, there are no problems on the surface in European countries, but the people of each country have extremely tense psychological states. The people of our country should be even more vigilant.</p>
<p>Situation in Europe</p>
<p>Continuing to talk about the situation in Europe, Huang said that the current Spanish Civil War is nothing less than the beginning of an international war. The government and the rebels each have their international backgrounds, with Soviet Russia secretly aiding the government and Italy aiding the rebels. According to my observation, the war will not end in a short time and will continue to prolong, or even erupt into an international war. Recently, Germany and Italy in Europe have successively concluded agreements with Japan. Although the German side stated that it was not aimed at our country, at least Germany can contain Soviet Russia, so that Japan has no scruples and can carry out its plan to invade our country, which is tantamount to helping Japan invisibly.</p>

<h3>Drawing for Repayment of Principal on National Unification and Telecommunications Bonds Held Yesterday Morning Principal and Interest Amounting to 9,493,000 Yuan Telecommunications Payments at the End of the Month Unification Payments at the End of January</h3>

<h3>Seamen's Party Department Held Yesterday a Bandit Suppression and Traitor Elimination Rally More Than One Hundred Representatives From Seamen's Organizations Attended</h3>
<p>The Special Seamen's Party Department of China convened various seamen's organizations at the auditorium of the department at 10 a.m. yesterday to hold a bandit suppression and traitor elimination propaganda rally. Yang Xiaotian, a special commissioner of the party department, represented Liu Huogong as chairman, reported the significance of holding the rally, and Wang Jiyi gave a speech and issued a "Message to Seamen." The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Representatives</p>
<p>Yang Xiaotian (representing Liu Huogong), Liu Huogong, Hu Chaoxi, Zhang Donglin, Shen Zihou, Wang Yulin, Xie Ganqing, Wang Liren, Chen Jun, Cheng Deyuan, Wang Jiyi, Wang Chengjie of the China Yangtze River Union, Xiong Yisheng, Chen Ziguang of the Ewo Stevedoring Club, Zheng Xiacheng of the Houshen Tongyi Society, Xu Houzhi of the Outer Port Stevedores Mutual Aid Society, Li Zaichen of the China Merchants Jun'an Society, Qian Zhigang of the New Taikoo Stevedoring Club, Hong Yilin of the Sanbei Stevedoring Mutual Aid Society, Guo Chengshou of the Little Yangtze River Club, and representatives from various district branches and more than one hundred people.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>After the rituals, the chairman first reported that since the Chinese Revolution of 1911, which overthrew the Qing Dynasty, followed by the successful Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army, China's politics has made significant progress and all construction has also made rapid progress. Now, the country has been unified, but a few outdated elements and Red bandits and traitors are working as accomplices, engaging in sabotage. Fortunately, our loyal and brave soldiers, based on the spirit of not fearing death, are fighting against this reactionary force. Now, the remnants of the Red bandits have reached the end of their road, and the Mong-bandit army in the border areas has collapsed. Our comrades in the rear are doing their best to assist the front line in terms of materials and thoroughly eliminate the reactionary forces that intend to disrupt the rear. I hope that everyone will work hard based on these two meanings. Then, Wang Jiyi gave a speech, briefly saying that China is now at a critical juncture of life and death, but only by unanimously supporting the party's leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, can it be saved. The comrades of our party should work hard to save the country under the leadership of Chairman Chiang. (The "Message to Seamen" is omitted)</p>

<h3>Hu Xiyuan Reports on the Significance of the National Goods Joint Venture Company Yesterday at the Citizens' Promotion of National Goods Meeting</h3>
<p>In order to understand the significance of the National Goods Joint Venture Company led by the Ministry of Industry and the progress of the preparatory meeting held in Beijing, the Shanghai Citizens' Association for Promoting National Goods held a joint meeting at 2 p.m. yesterday and invited Hu Xiyuan, a member of the preparatory committee of the joint venture company, to attend and report. More than 30 people including Pan Gongzhan, Wu Yunshu, Cai Someone Bai, Xing Shigang, Fang Qian'ge, Zheng Hairuo, and Shao Daren attended. The following is an excerpt from the report by Committee Member Hu. The National Economic Construction Movement Committee is actively engaged in all aspects of economic construction, and promoting national goods is also one of its work guidelines. Therefore, it advocates the establishment of a National Goods Joint Venture Company to make the national goods business network popular throughout the country, so that those who love to use national goods can purchase national goods conveniently and at any time and place. At the same time, national goods can also make considerable progress because of this. The method is very good. The Ministry of Industry, entrusted by the Economic Construction Movement Committee to fully handle this matter, and the China National Goods Production and Sales Association already have the organization of the National Joint Office of the China National Goods Company, which can be used as a reference for planning the National Goods Joint Venture Company. The preparatory committee members for the National Goods Joint Venture Company are mostly from the China National Goods Production and Sales Association and the National Joint Office, which has caused misunderstandings and doubts among comrades outside. The reason may also be here. On the 4th of this month, when the National Goods Joint Venture Company convened a founding meeting of the preparatory committee at the auditorium of the Ministry of Industry, Minister Wu earnestly stated that the government is seeking welfare for national goods throughout the country, not for national goods in one place, and its nature is also universal rather than one-sided or one type of national goods. In short, for all national goods, the government will never let there be any tendency to wither. As for the company's share capital, it will also be openly solicited. All national goods companies and factories will be given the same opportunity to subscribe for shares. If the shares required by national goods companies and factories are insufficient, the government can distribute them, so as to show the government's sincerity in not competing with the people for profits. As for the department stores selling national goods, after the National Goods Joint Venture Company is established in the future, it is also willing to distribute and sell at extremely fair wholesale prices, and will never let department stores lose the opportunity to sell. It is also not true that government agencies will be required to have invoices from the National Goods Joint Venture Company in order to reimburse public goods in the future. It may be a misunderstanding that those who have group goods but do not purchase national goods will not be reimbursed. It is hoped that department stores will not cause unnecessary panic. When the preparatory committee members held preparatory meetings, they all advocated that all facilities should be based on the principles of openness and fairness. The size of our country's territory, the population, and the strength of the consumer forces are by no means something that a few factories can handle. However, the quality of the products will inevitably escape the public law of natural selection. This is something that national goods factories cannot fail to pay attention to. The preparatory committee has been in place for a very short time. It is best to hope that comrades throughout the country who are enthusiastic about national goods will actively invest in the National Goods Joint Venture Company, so that it can have a close relationship forever. Now, if various national goods organizations and national goods comrades have any insightful advice, they should give practical instructions to the preparatory committee. According to the speculation of someone Xiyuan, the preparatory committee will definitely accept it happily. Now that the national crisis is serious and foreign goods are dumped, since we have the leadership of the government, we should all work hard to assist the National Goods Joint Venture Company, so that we can see its success as soon as possible and build the foundation for economic construction.</p>
<h3>Telephone Service Between Nanchang, Jiujiang, and Shanghai Opened Yesterday Morning</h3>

Prior to this, Xu Xueyu, director of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, and Yu Bingjian, chief engineer, had a test call with the directors of the Nanchang and Jiujiang Telephone Bureaus. The toll is 2.8 yuan from Shanghai to Nanchang and 2.6 yuan from Shanghai to Jiujiang. A special district surcharge of 0.3 yuan is added. The business hours and procedures are the same as elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Lawyers' Association Yesterday Submitted to the Ministry of Finance Requesting Interpretation of Doubts Regarding the Provisional Income Tax Law and Implementation Regulations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers' Association yesterday submitted a document to the Ministry of Finance, stating: "Submitting this request for interpretation of doubts regarding the Provisional Income Tax Law and Implementation Regulations, and requesting that clear provisions be made when drafting various income tax collection methods to prevent disputes. It is understood that income tax is a modern and sound tax system, and the government, in order to meet the urgent financial needs of extraordinary times, resolutely embraced it and pledged to comply. However, regarding the content of the tax law, as far as our association has examined, there seem to be many points that easily give rise to doubts. Please allow us to enumerate them to the Ministry. It is found that Article 2 of the Provisional Income Tax Law already stipulates that income from salaries and remuneration should be taxed according to the monthly average income. However, Clause 2 of Paragraph 7 of the same article stipulates that income of the second category, calculated monthly or annually, may be calculated for taxation on a monthly average basis. Income that is irregular or one-time is to be calculated for taxation based on the income of each month. This seems to be an exception to calculating tax on a monthly average basis. It is found that remuneration received by independent professionals for their professions and work, and other monetary payments, such as the annual advisory fees, audit fees, and consultation fees of doctors, lawyers, and accountants, etc., are considered to be calculated monthly or annually. However, other remuneration calculated on a case-by-case basis, although of a regular or continuous nature, often cannot maintain a stable state. For example, one month's income may be particularly high, while another month may have no income at all, or one month's work may be intense, but the income is deferred to the next month. This is a constant occurrence. On the other hand, the various expenses listed in Article 17 of the Implementation Regulations are of a recurring nature. If these business expenses are divided on a monthly basis and deducted separately from each month's income, the burden will not be equal due to the varying amounts of income in each month. It is reasonable to combine the whole year and deduct them from the total income for the year in order to obtain an accurate taxable income amount. In this regard, the provisions of Clause 2 of Paragraph 7 of the Provisional Income Tax Law and Clause 2 of Paragraph 1 of Article 26 of the Implementation Regulations, which require that the income from the remuneration of independent professionals must be declared on a monthly basis and taxes paid on a monthly basis, are cumbersome in procedure and, in practice, violate the principle of fair taxation based on average calculation. It is difficult to comply with them. Would the Ministry consider amending the Provisional Income Tax Law Implementation Regulations or supplementing them in the collection methods by changing the declaration of income for independent professionals to be made within three months after the annual settlement, and changing the payment of taxes to be made within a certain number of days after the annual settlement declaration, so that the average income calculation can be accurate and the goal of fair tax payment can be achieved? This is the first matter that should be adopted by the Ministry. Upon reviewing the Provisional Income Tax Law, the calculation of income for independent professionals is based on hourly taxation, but Article 17 of the Implementation Regulations imposes a restriction that necessary business travel expenses cannot exceed 30% of their respective remuneration. Although this can eliminate abuses and tax evasion in the calculation of income on a case-by-case basis, auditing becomes more cumbersome. In reality, travel expenses and income often cannot maintain a constant ratio. It seems appropriate to make adjustments. Furthermore, regarding the so-called "other directly necessary expenses for business" in Clause 4 of Paragraph 1 of the same article, how many items are included and how are they defined? Details should be specified in the collection methods to prevent disputes and facilitate compliance. This is the second matter for the Ministry to review and discuss. As for the business community's dealings with the banking industry, it is customary to settle accounts on a monthly basis. Due to seasonal factors, for some months of the year, small amounts of interest can be earned on savings accounts, while on some days, larger amounts of interest must be paid on outstanding accounts. If we adhere rigidly to the provisions of Clause 3 of Paragraph 7 of the Provisional Income Tax Law, which states, "The income from interest on savings deposits shall be calculated for taxation based on the interest paid each time or at the time of settlement," and do not allow for annual combined calculation, so that taxation is calculated based on the total interest amount after offsetting savings and outstanding interest, it also seems unfair. Members of our association have closer ties with the business community, and based on our observations, we dare not remain silent. This is the third matter for the Ministry to examine. In summary, the above three points are merely the views of our association, offered to the Ministry. We humbly request that they be adopted and await your instructions with trepidation."</p>

<h3>Chamber of Commerce Sends Letter to Tax Authorities Requesting Admonishment of Stamp Inspectors, Fifteen Trade Associations Apply: Do Not Investigate and Penalize for Lack of Unit Price on Goods</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating: "We respectfully inform you that on the 9th of this month, the Shanghai Marine Products and Groceries Industry Association, Cooked Food Industry Association, Sesame Oil Industry Association, Sugar Industry Association, Dried Longan Industry Association, Fresh and Frozen Fish Industry Association, Northern Goods Industry Association, Tea and Bamboo Shoot Industry Association, Northern and Southern Goods Exchange Industry Association, Southern Goods Industry Association, Pickled Mustard Tuber Industry Association, Fruit and Local Produce Industry Association, Salted Fish Industry Association, Sea Cucumber and Bird's Nest Industry Association, and Wax Industry Association jointly sent a letter, stating: 'Our members, when selling goods to various shops in this city, in addition to clearly stating the names, quantities, and prices of the goods on the invoice and affixing sufficient stamps in accordance with the law, have never specified the total value. The reason for not specifying it is that the goods sold must be weighed net after deducting the weight of the packaging. The weight of this packaging is not consistent. Our members will invariably consider it light, while the other party will invariably consider it heavy. In order to avoid disputes, after the goods arrive, they are weighed net together, and only then is the net weight calculated. Before the net weight is determined, it is impossible to calculate the total value. This is the first reason why it cannot be specified. Also, after the goods are sent, leakage and loss are unavoidable during transit. The buyer claims that there is a shortage, while the seller claims that there is none. Disputes arise repeatedly, and the result is that deductions must be made. Before the deduction is agreed upon, it is again impossible to calculate the total value. This is another reason why it cannot be specified. These two major reasons are why only the quantity and price of the goods can be listed on the invoice, and the total value cannot be specified. This is what the facts have dictated, and it has been done this way for many years. Since the implementation of the new stamp tax, all merchants have complied with the regulations and affixed stamps. Although our members cannot specify the amount on these invoices due to factual circumstances, they must calculate the amount and affix stamps separately according to the Category 1 tax rate, without ever understamping or failing to affix stamps sufficiently. They have followed the law and never violated it. However, stamp inspectors, without understanding the situation, consider it non-compliant and send these invoices to the court for trial. The court, also without understanding these actual circumstances, readily imposes fines of three yuan per document. When the fines were first imposed, it was still considered accidental, and our members thought that the amount was not large and paid them painfully. However, in recent months, it has become increasingly severe, with summonses and fines occurring almost daily, forcing our members to go to court and exhaust themselves. Also, due to the dignity of the judiciary, they do not dare to argue and accept the fines, which they are unwilling to do, but cannot avoid being fined. They suffer injustice and losses and are in great pain. We have read the Ministry of Finance's reply to your association, document number Shui Zi 1146, which states: "If the invoice already lists the unit price of the goods, it cannot be said that the amount is not specified. Stamps should be affixed according to the highest tax rate. If the invoice of He Feng Guohuo Company indeed had the words 'discounted price of one yuan and two jiao' when it was issued, then the inspectors who did not investigate in detail and hastily sent it for punishment were obviously negligent." It also states that the Taxation Department has instructed the inspectors to pay close attention to such documents in the future. This clearly shows that if the invoice lists the quantity and price and sufficient stamps have been affixed in accordance with the law, it does not matter whether the total value is specified or not. Comprehending the meaning of the words, it is very clear. Upon further investigation of the Stamp Tax Law and its Implementation Regulations, there is no explicit provision that invoices that do not specify the total value are considered illegal. Therefore, this type of punishment is without legal basis and is being carried out brazenly, which seems to be a loss of the nation's intention to protect and care for businesses. Our members find it difficult to operate peacefully with daily fines, and we believe that there must be many businesses in the city suffering this kind of pain. If we do not request rectification, how can we relieve them? Therefore, we are stating the facts, citing the Ministry of Finance's instructions, and jointly submitting a letter requesting your association's assistance in petitioning the government to quickly rectify the situation, so as to avoid harassment and reassure businesses." Based on this, the fact that invoices specify the unit price of goods and the amount, but the total amount is not calculated, and that inspectors are abusively investigating and punishing, our association has sent letters to your department twice, on the 2nd and 7th of this month, requesting strict orders for correction to avoid disturbing businesses, but we have not yet received a reply. According to the Ministry of Finance's document number Shui Zi 11462, "If the invoice already lists the unit price of the goods, it cannot be said that the amount is not specified. Stamps should be affixed according to the highest tax rate." Therefore, the various circumstances stated by the trade association, according to the Ministry's instructions, should not be investigated and punished. In short, if the inspectors are not strictly admonished to handle matters in accordance with the law, the businesses will inevitably suffer. We hereby send this letter again, hoping that your department will take note of it and promptly order the inspectors to comply with the Ministry's instructions and no longer abusively investigate and punish these invoices. We also hope for a reply."</p>
<h3>Tenants' Association Yesterday Published a Letter to Tenants: Deduct One Day's Rent to Support the Patriotic Movement</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Tenants' Association yesterday published a letter to tenants, stating: "To all tenants in the city: To resist foreign aggression, we must strengthen national defense. On the occasion of Chairman Chiang's 50th birthday, donations were made by all sectors to purchase airplanes, which surged like a storm. Subsequently, a one-day movement was initiated to continue the effort. Since its implementation, industrial and commercial firms have contributed percentages of profits, and staff and workers have donated their salaries, demonstrating the patriotic enthusiasm of the people. However, the real estate industry has not yet shown any expression. It is thought that real estate has the largest assets. If one day's rent could be contributed to the country, the results would be considerable. Therefore, our association has suggested to the Airplane Purchase Birthday Celebration Association and the City Residents' One-Day Contribution to the Nation Promotion Association that they initiate a one-day real estate movement and suggest designating a donation collection point, where tenants can pay one day's rent. Tenants can then deduct the receipt from the rent paid monthly, and the collection agency will publish it in the newspapers daily to ensure credibility. The Airplane Purchase Birthday Celebration Association has replied, adopting this suggestion and stipulating that the association will collect donations. It has now sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to instruct the Real Estate Industry Association to handle it. In light of this, all tenants in our city, pained by the enemy's aggression and caring for the country, dare not lag behind. It is hoped that you will enthusiastically pay one day's rent starting from December 20th and deduct the receipt from the rent paid monthly. The Airplane Purchase Birthday Celebration Association provides a full guarantee for this matter. It neither increases unexpected burdens nor expresses patriotic enthusiasm. It is hoped that all tenants in our city will rise up together to promote its success. We eagerly await it."</p>
<h3>Three Groups Schedule Joint Executive and Supervisory Committee Meeting, Representatives Telegraph that Defense Works Are Solid, Still Need Winter Supplies and Medicine</h3>

The association has now received a telegram from its representative, Luo Youxuan, from Taiyuan, and has decided to convene a joint executive and supervisory committee meeting to discuss active assistance measures for Suiyuan. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Representative's Telegram (Omitted above) When returning to Suiyuan from Bailingmiao, I presented a letter, which I hope reached your desk. I learned everything in Suiyuan.

<h3>泉州老航道廢棄　新船路已測竣　避去港心山藏兩礁　可保永久航行安全　海關趕設航行標誌</h3>
<p>The old waterway in Quanzhou is abandoned, the new shipping route has been surveyed, avoiding the two reefs of Gangxin and Shancang, ensuring permanent navigation safety, and the customs is rushing to install navigation markers.</p>
<p>Quanzhou, Fujian, as an inland waterway, has always been used for commercial transportation. Ships traveling outside the port of Quanzhou must pass through four submerged reefs, and there are no navigation markers. Therefore, there are frequent incidents of running aground and encountering danger. Over the years, shipping companies, including the insurance industry, have suffered losses of millions of dollars due to commercial vessel accidents on this route. This year, permission was obtained from the Ministry of the Navy to send a survey ship to the outer harbor of Quanzhou to conduct on-site surveys and draw new nautical charts, noting the</p>
<p>submerged reefs and shoals</p>
<p>to guide future commercial shipping. Mr. Gu Weihan, the captain of the survey team, returned to Shanghai after completing the survey and immediately presented the newly drawn Quanzhou Customs map to Mr. Xu Zufan, a technician from the Shipping Insurance Joint Association. Mr. Xu, a senior figure in the maritime industry, discussed with Mr. Gu how to improve the Shanghai-Quanzhou shipping route to ensure permanent safety in the future. Originally, ships traveling from Shanghai to Quanzhou, upon reaching the outer harbor of Quanzhou (about one hour's journey from the port of Quanzhou), had to pass between the Gangxin Reef and the Shancang Reef. The waterway there was about 300 feet wide, and the most dangerous Gangxin Reef was submerged 19 feet at high tide and exposed about one foot above the water at low tide. The Shancang Reef was only four feet away from the water surface at low tide. If transportation is not careful,</p>
<p>danger will be encountered.</p>
<p>As for Xiaozhui Island, it is only nine feet at low tide. Even with a pilot (usually a local fisherman), safety cannot be guaranteed. After deliberation, it was decided to abandon the original old waterway and use the newly discovered new shipping route by the survey team, which is very safe. This new shipping route sails between Xiaozhui Island and Beidazhui Island, with a wide channel of 600 to 700 feet, avoiding the two dangerous reefs of Gangxin and Shancang. From now on, ships going to Quanzhou can reduce danger and avoid losses. After the agreement, Xu Zufan and Gu Weihan, together with Yao Haimin, a representative of the shipping company, visited the Jianghai Customs Inspection Office on the day to request the prompt installation of</p>
<p>navigation markers</p>
<p>as the standard for guiding ships traveling on the new shipping route. Generally, a marker will be set up on Dazhui Island, with a flag and light hanging, and a buoy will be placed on the edge of the shoal to indicate the direction of the channel. The new nautical chart will be given to the Inspection Office for review. Under the discussion of the three gentlemen Xu, Gu, and Yao, they readily agreed and promised to immediately send a ship to the outer harbor of Quanzhou to set up markers and river cones according to the designated location, and promised to go there within this week, hoping that the new shipping route will be opened immediately. Then, the new Shanghai-Quanzhou shipping route can be opened next month.</p>

<h3>昨晚降霧</h3>

<h3>寶華等三綢廠　工人罷工</h3>
<p>Workers Strike at Three Silk Factories Including Baohua</p>
<p>Dagon Society Yun, since the Tianhua Silk Weaving Factory on Linan Road, in early October of this year, due to the organization of a trade union by the workers, the workers' representatives Zhang Boxi, Zhang Yuezhen, Huang Heqin, Zhou Xian'e, Zhu Shengrong, Zhou Ju'e, Sun Yousheng, and other seven people were dismissed on the pretext, which aroused public outrage. At that time, Yucun Silk Weaving Factory also had conflicts because the workers participated in the trade union, which was envied by the factory. More than 20 workers were injured. The workers united with Baohua, Yucai, Yiyou, Fuxing, Yongfeng, Tiancheng and other six factories with more than 1,000 workers, causing a strike, and petitioned the city party department, social bureau, and general trade union to demand that the factory reinstate the dismissed workers, compensate the workers for the losses during the strike period, and the Yucun factory bear the medical expenses of the injured workers. After repeated persuasion from the party and government authorities, it was decided to resume work first and then mediate. The labor side respected the opinions of the military, party and government organs, so the strike only lasted three days before resuming work. During the mediation period, Yucun and Yiyou factories dismissed another seven workers. The labor side wanted to take action at that time, but the city's general trade union sent people to persuade and stop them, saying that they must wait for mediation during the mediation period and not create new problems, so no new incidents occurred. After more than a month, the Social Bureau convened both parties for mediation several times, and finally on the sixth of this month, it approved that, except for the five workers dismissed from the Maihua factory, who were to be dismissed, the remaining two, and the workers dismissed from the Yucun and Yiyou factories, should all be reinstated. The other conditions were to be negotiated by both parties. After receiving the approval, the labor side expressed acceptance and went to each factory to resume work on the 7th, but was rejected by the factory. The labor side then petitioned the city party department and the general trade union to send people to each factory to persuade the factory to comply with government laws and regulations and allow the workers to resume work, but it was not accepted either. The workers were dissatisfied and suddenly at about 9 pm last night, more than 500 workers from the Baohua, Yucun, and Yiyou factories went on strike. The Dagon Society reporter rushed to the factories on strike to inspect, and found that except for three or two employees and police officers, they were empty.</p>

<h3>李貴平　黎明躍下晒台　被華探目經過拘獲　查明妓院私擅監禁</h3>
<p>Li Guiping Jumps from Balcony at Dawn, Apprehended by Chinese Detective, Investigation Reveals Brothel Illegally Imprisoning Him</p>
<p>Chinese detective Cao Qishan of the Laozha Police Station was assigned to investigate a case at Deyu Lane, Lloyd Road, at 5:10 am yesterday morning. Just as he arrived at the entrance of No. 4, a person suddenly jumped from the balcony of the house. Detective Cao thought that it was still dawn, and that he had jumped from the balcony, which was very suspicious. Therefore, he immediately stepped forward to arrest him. After questioning, he said his name was Li Guiping, from Jiangbei. This time, he had been imprisoned by someone for four days and could not escape, so he took advantage of the people in the house being unprepared and jumped off the building to escape. The detective immediately asked why he had been imprisoned. Li replied that he had a younger sister named Guiying, who is now 19 years old and married to Xu Yongkuan. Last month, she came to Shanghai with her uncle Wu Changshan and others, and was imprisoned on the 19th of last month in a brothel opened by Yangzhou native Wang Liandou and his concubine Wang Huang on the 4th of Deyu Lane, Lloyd Road, for a term of one and a half years, with a value of 75 yuan. However, the younger sister soon escaped with a guest, which he did not know. On the 4th, he went to visit, and Wang and others forced him to hand over Guiying, otherwise he would have to return the value. Because he was unable to return it, he was imprisoned. Today, while they were sleeping soundly, he jumped off the balcony to escape. The detectives then entered and arrested Wang Lianbao, Wang Huang, and the prostitutes Wang Guixiang from Suzhou and Wang Gendi from Yangzhou, along with Li Guiping, and brought them to the police station. They were then escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunli stated the details of the case, and because the investigation was not yet detailed, he requested that all the people be temporarily detained. Judge Pan Zhenyang approved the request and ordered them to be detained until next week for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>中華會計師事務所　設企業信託部</h3>
<p>Chinese Certified Public Accountants Firm Establishes Enterprise Trust Department</p>
<p>Engaging Experts to Take Charge</p>
<p>The Chinese Certified Public Accountants Firm at No. 275 Gordon Road, Shanghai, recently recognized that with the national unification and the rapid progress of building the nation, the social economy has suddenly shown a thriving trend. Since the currency reform and the reorganization of public bonds, those with huge capital will inevitably tend to invest in industries. However, in the past, the general wealthy capitalists in China were unable to conduct detailed research on various enterprise situations, so they could not make appropriate use of their surplus funds. Conversely, talents with plans or knowledge of operating enterprises and new inventions often suffer from a lack of capital and no one to cooperate with, and good plans cannot be realized. This phenomenon is indeed an obstacle to the development of enterprises. Therefore, the firm has specially created an enterprise trust department, engaging experts in physics, chemistry, engineering, economics, finance, law, and other fields to take charge. Anyone, Chinese or foreign, who needs talent, material resources, or financial assistance to start or reorganize an enterprise can entrust the firm to study the plan and introduce cooperation between the three parties of talent, material, and finance. This kind of organization has been practiced in European and American countries for a long time, especially developed on Wall Street in New York, but it is still a pioneering undertaking in China and should attract great attention from the industrial sector. The brief rules of the department are appended below: (1) Anyone who wants to start a new enterprise or reorganize an old business and encounters problems in any aspect of talent, material resources, or financial resources and needs assistance will be sincerely planned and introduced once entrusted to ensure the success of the business and the satisfaction of the founder. (2) All entrusted cases will be directly handled by experts quickly and kept strictly confidential. (3) For all entrusted cases, the client may designate a certain expert of the firm to handle it. (4) The standards for charging fees for all entrusted cases are determined based on the effectiveness. Fees will be collected after both parties negotiate. (5) Any Chinese and foreign people who are interested in business and have any inquiries are very welcome.</p>

<h3>Appeal of Japanese Sailor Hideo Nakayama Case: Full Text of the Yang-Ye Judgment</h3>
<p>The judgment states that the confession was used as evidence of the crime, arguing it wasn't obtained through torture; the demonstration of events was not entirely involuntary and therefore cannot be entirely dismissed; and the findings of the original trial were largely consistent.</p>
<p>Yang Wendao and Ye Haisheng, Cantonese men accused of murdering Japanese sailor Hideo Nakayama on the night of November 9th of last year at North Sichuan Road and Doulan Road, were sentenced to death and deprived of their civil rights for life by the First Special District Court. Dissatisfied with the verdict, Yang and Ye appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court. The court concluded its trial on the 2nd of this month and announced its judgment on the afternoon of the previous day, rejecting the appeal. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. In order to quickly conclude the case, the Second Branch of the High Court promptly printed the judgment, which was delivered to the appellants and their lawyers yesterday afternoon. Due to the great public interest in this case, we have obtained the judgment and transcribed the full text below.</p>
<p>Criminal Judgment of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court (Second Instance No. 297 of the 25th Year of the Republic)</p>
<p>Appellant Yang Wendao, male, 42 years old, Cantonese, works as a godown keeper at a foreign firm, resides at No. 18, Tongan Lane, Tangshan Road, represented by lawyers Tang Huaiqun and Guo Qiming.</p>
<p>Appellant Ye Haisheng, male, 28 years old, Cantonese, works as a dancer, resides at No. 22, Cangko Road, Qingdao, represented by lawyer Wang Shizong, and appointed lawyer Zhang Zhirang.</p>
<p>The above appellants, in the case of murder, appeal the first instance judgment of the Shanghai First Special District Court of the Republic of China on October 2nd, 25th year. The court renders the following judgment:</p>
<p>Main Text of Facts</p>
<p>The appeal is rejected. Yang Wendao was the former chairman of the Hongshun Mutual Aid Society. Ye Haisheng, also known as Xiao Guangdong, was also a member of the society. After Yang Wendao left Shanghai, the Hongshun Society disintegrated. In November of the 23rd year of the Republic, Yang Wendao returned to Shanghai, and he and Ye Haisheng and others organized the Tongren and Tongyi Associations, both with Yang Wendao as chairman and Ye Haisheng as a member. Due to the small number of members, their influence was far less than that of the former Hongshun Society. Seeking to expand their influence, they secretly plotted to assassinate Japanese officers and soldiers to incite unrest. Once the plan was decided, they went to Doulan Road to inspect the location on the afternoon of November 3rd of the same year. On the night of the 5th of the same month, inside the Tongyi Association at No. 71, Yongji Lane, Bazilu Road, they used paper slips to determine that Ye Haisheng would carry out the assassination. On the afternoon of the 9th of the same month, around 8 p.m., Yang Wendao and Ye Haisheng, along with a man named Jieke, left the Yuegong Hotel. Upon reaching the Dongyang School on North Sichuan Road, Yang Wendao took a handgun out of a book and handed it to Ye Haisheng. They continued forward until the intersection of Doulan Road, where they saw a Japanese sailor, Hideo Nakayama, walking. Ye Haisheng followed him to the vicinity of the entrance to Fangle Lane on Doulan Road, where he shot Nakayama in the head from the side, causing him to fall to the ground. Nakayama died shortly after. Ye Haisheng fled into Fangle Lane, discarded the handgun under the watchman's kiosk in the lane, and then fled back. After investigation by the police, the appellants were arrested one after another. A practical physics textbook, in which a gun was hidden, was found in Yang Wendao's home at No. 18, Tongan Lane, Tangshan Road, and was submitted as evidence in the indictment.</p>
<p>Reasoning</p>
<p>Upon investigation, the deceased Hideo Nakayama had a circular gunshot wound with a diameter of 0.several centimeters located 7 cm diagonally to the right from the center of the posterior occipital bone, and 6 cm above and behind the external auditory canal. The wound damaged an artery, causing profuse bleeding. There was also an irregular exit wound with a diameter of 2 cm on the front of the head. The surrounding skull was fractured and significantly bulging, with brain matter exposed and the artery ruptured, resulting in a large amount of bleeding. The cause of death was determined to be a gunshot wound to the head, resulting in brain damage and cerebral hemorrhage, as verified and diagnosed by Japanese military surgeon Lieutenant Colonel Ogawa Kiyoshi in a medical certificate attached to the file. Furthermore, Police Officer No. 61 of the Japanese Concession recovered a bullet head 8 feet south of the bloodstain at the scene of the incident. Detective No. 50 of the Japanese Concession simultaneously recovered a shell casing from the same location, and Head Detective Iaso recovered a handgun with the number 241146 containing six bullets from under the wooden kiosk of the patrolling police in Fangle Lane. The bullet head and shell casing found at the scene of the incident were fired from that handgun, as confirmed by Mr. Kalay, an expert in firearms at the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, who submitted an expert report and photographs. The practical physics textbook used to conceal the handgun was found at Yang Wendao's home at No. 18, Tongan Lane, Tangshan Road, on April 19th of this year. The gun-shaped hole in the book matches the size, length, and width of the handgun, and there are over forty traces of rust, indicating that it was used to conceal this handgun and no other similar handgun. This has been confirmed by experts from the fingerprint section of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Dickson, and the Institute of Forensic Medicine of the Ministry of Judicial Administration. Moreover, after the book was seized by the police and placed on the table, Yang Wendao, without being questioned, immediately admitted that the book belonged to him, as confirmed by Deputy Detective Crow and Kawashima, who were present at the original trial (see the original trial record of July 8th of this year). Yang Wendao also admitted during his initial interrogation at the original trial on April 20th of this year that he had carved the hole in the book to hide the handgun. Although he later stated that the book he used to hide the gun was another English book, that the gun license was obtained from the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, that the gun belonged to Li Mu, and that the book was planted by Yang Jianzhong, etc., the police compared the Dimon handgun that Li Mu of the Public Security Bureau had previously lent to Yang Wendao, and it did not match the gun-shaped hole in the book. Yang Jianzhong was also summoned and questioned at the original trial and denied planting the book, stating that he had no feud with Yang Wendao, had never been to his house, did not know where he lived, and had never seen the book. Therefore, the facts that the handgun and bullets in question were the murder weapon used to kill Hideo Nakayama and that the practical physics textbook used to conceal the weapon belonged to Yang Wendao are beyond doubt. As for whether the appellants are the perpetrators of the murder, Ye Haisheng initially denied the crime in his statements at the original trial. Although he later confessed, he sometimes claimed that Yang Wendao fired the gun and sometimes claimed that he acted alone and that Yang Wendao had nothing to do with it. His testimony remained evasive. After the original trial court explained the consequences and questioned him repeatedly, he finally confessed in detail how Yang Wendao initiated the plot to murder a Japanese sailor, how they discussed it at the Tongyi Association, how they went together to survey the route, and how he was selected to carry out the assassination. He also stated that on November 9th of last year, he booked Room 9 at the Yuegong Hotel under the name of Xia Chunjie. Around 8 p.m. he, Yang Wendao, and Jieke left the Yuegong Hotel and headed north. Upon reaching the Dongyang School, Yang Wendao took a handgun out of a book and handed it to him. When they reached the intersection of Doulan Road, he saw a Japanese sailor. Yang Wendao nodded towards the sailor, and he followed the sailor. After walking a short distance and not seeing any police officers, he fired the gun. After the shooting, he fled through Fangle Lane, discarded the handgun, and fled back to the Yuegong Hotel. He claimed that his current statements were all truthful and he would not retract them. Furthermore, the judge appointed by the original trial court took Ye Haisheng to the scene for an on-site inspection. Before the appointed judge, Ye Haisheng accurately pointed out the location where Yang Wendao handed him the gun, where he saw the sailor, where he fired the gun, and the route he took to escape after the shooting. He also corrected witness Hu Xianghe, who stated during the site visit that he saw the suspect flee into Shuangle Lane after passing the telegraph pole, clarifying that he fled directly into Fangle Lane and did not pass through the telegraph pole. The testimony was clear and accurate. The testimony of witness Hu Xianghe that he heard a gunshot and saw a person wearing black clothes fleeing into Fangle Lane, and the testimony of witness Pan Qiaoying that she saw a Japanese sailor and a person wearing a black suit walking north in opposite directions on Doulan Road on the night of the incident, and then heard a gunshot, is consistent with Ye Haisheng's confession at the original trial that he was wearing the black suit in question on November 9th and 10th of last year. His departure towards the scene of the incident was witnessed by Zhang Caiyuan, who stated, "Around 8 p.m. on November 9th, I went to No. 14 Yuqing Lane to find the dancer Xiuying. There were many cars parked at the entrance of Yuqing Lane. I walked around to the west sidewalk and headed south. When I reached the Nanyang Dance Hall, I saw Xiao Guangdong in front, about five or six shops away, followed by two other people, one was Jieke, and I didn't recognize the other one. They were walking north, passing me head-on, and I didn't pay attention to them." After the incident, he fled back to the Yuegong Hotel, which was corroborated by Hai Leya, who stated, "Around 10 p.m. that night, I went to the Yuegong Hotel to find a friend. Zhuo and I ran to the entrance of Room 9, pushed the door halfway open. Zhuo asked Ye Haisheng, 'Why are you like this?' and he said, 'I just came back from a fight.'" It is undeniable that Ye Haisheng himself admitted at the original trial that he booked Room 9 at the Yuegong Hotel under the name of Xia Chunjie and that he fled back to the Yuegong Hotel after the shooting. In addition, the handgun that Ye Haisheng claimed Yang Wendao gave him was taken from a book, and the book was found by the police in Yang Wendao's home. Therefore, cross-referencing and examining the evidence, Ye Haisheng's confession is consistent with the facts and can be adopted as evidence of the appellants' crime. Although Ye Haisheng later recanted his confession, claiming that it was obtained through torture and that he swallowed buttons and locks to seek a quick death and that he felt pain in both sides of his ribs, with the left side being more severe, the original trial court sent him to the Shanghai Municipal Council Hospital for examination by a forensic doctor, and the examination revealed that there were no metal objects in his abdomen and no visible damage to his ribs (see the examination report of forensic doctor Wei Ligong, original trial Volume 2, page 147). The scar on his upper lip under his nose was caused by Ye Haisheng scratching himself, as Ye Haisheng stated on May 21st of this year when defense lawyer Zhang Zhirang and others visited him at the police station. The original trial court questioned the lawyer about this, and the lawyer confirmed that he did say this. Furthermore, according to Ye Haisheng, the date he was subjected to torture was two weeks after the original trial was postponed. Checking the original trial records, the postponement of two weeks occurred on May 6th of this year. Ye Haisheng had already confessed in writing before May 6th. Therefore, his claim of torture is clearly a pretext for denial. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Takahashi Nursery School Holds Parents' Social Gathering</h3>
<p>The Takahashi Rural Improvement Association, to connect villagers in each district, held cordial meetings in the Tunliang Lane and Gaoxing districts on separate occasions the other day. There were also speeches and educational plays to entertain the district residents. The situation was extremely enthusiastic. Considering that the Takahashi Town Nursery School, which it sponsors, rarely has the opportunity to gather together and discuss improvements, except for daily home visits by the principal, female teachers, and family members, the association held a parents' social gathering in the school auditorium at 1 p.m. yesterday. More than twenty people, including Sun Gengyan and Cai Zhiyuan and his wife, attended. In addition to visiting the school's educational and hygienic facilities, Chief Executive Wang Kuizheng, as chairman, gave a detailed explanation of the importance of childcare education and the urgent need to promote rural nurseries. Deputy Chief Executive Lian Yousan continued to elaborate on this, which was particularly moving. Afterwards, major important issues such as educational improvement, winter equipment, and organizational improvement were discussed.</p>
<h3>Fire at Zhikang Foreign Firm</h3>
<p>At 3 a.m. yesterday, a warehouse of the Zhikang Foreign Firm at No. 54 Yangxing Street, Xiaodongmen, Nanshi, suddenly caught fire due to carelessness. Immediately, thick smoke billowed, and the fire was extremely fierce. The Fire Brigade rushed to the scene and tried their best to put out the fire. After about three hours, the fire was finally extinguished. As a result, the building was completely destroyed, and a large number of straw hats, tobacco products, blankets, and other items were burned, resulting in huge losses.</p>
<h3>Assassination of Xiansheng Mining Case: Record of Trial and Interrogation of Male and Female Suspects</h3>
<p>Japanese Male and Female Witnesses Interrogated in the Morning, Statements of Defendants Obtained in the Afternoon, Case Needs Further Investigation Before Debate</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau cracked the case of the assassination of Japanese national Xiansheng Mining and transferred Mao Yonghu, Wang Zhensheng, Zhao Yunhong, Zhu Guisheng, Chen Enming, Jin Daoquan, and female accomplices Tu Zaishi and Zhang Mashi, a total of eight suspects, who were also involved in the assassination of Nakayama Hideo, to the local court. Prosecutor Tang Ruxiu prosecuted the six male suspects for murder and the two female suspects for illegally possessing firearms. Yesterday was the second continued interrogation. At 9 a.m., the Public Security Bureau's Ximen Branch sent Zhou Junfu, a patrol officer, and sixteen police officers to the court to provide protection. Police chief Zhang Xingping, Chen Xigui, police sergeants Gu Hanqing, Liu Fu, and others were ordered to supervise all the bailiffs in the courtroom</p>
<p>to maintain order. Seventy temporary visitor passes were specially made to limit the number of attendees to avoid crowding. The west iron gate of the court was temporarily closed to show preparedness. In advance, Japanese witnesses, male "Men Hiroshi," "Kuriki Kintaro," female "Nakamura Kiko," "Sugiyama Kiya," "Kitayama Mazaniya," as well as Sugiyama's two children and Kitayama's one child who were with Xiansheng at the time, were summoned. Xiansheng's wife had already returned to her country, so the summons was canceled. Those attending as observers included "Suguchi Ryuzaemon," the police officer of the Japanese Consulate Police Department, and "Okumura Giichiro," a police inspector of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Japanese consulate</p>
<p>officials Takahashi Saburo and others. Huang Hua, section chief of the third section of the Public Security Bureau, and Xia Zhongming, director of the audit section, led them to the court. Around 10 a.m., Presiding Judge Cai Dicheng, along with Judge Shao Qinzhi, Li Xuedeng, Prosecutor Tang Ruxiu, and Court Clerk Zhou Yuejuan, opened the first criminal court for trial. Appointed pro bono lawyers Yu Chengxiu and Yu Zhongluo also arrived on time. After the court ordered the defendants to be brought to court, interrogation began. Xia Zhongming, the director of the audit section of the Public Security Bureau, served as the temporary translator. The court asked "Nakamura Kiko" to testify. He stated that he was 20 years old, from Nagasaki, Japan, and resided on Diswei Road, Qimei Road.</p>
<p>He worked as a tailor. On July 10th of this year, at 8 p.m., I passed through Qimei Road and saw two Chinese men, one wearing a blue short coat and the other wearing a black long coat, talking there. Their behavior was suspicious because they were carrying broken mats. Later, I heard what sounded like a gunshot. I immediately saw a person fall to the ground. Because he was wearing a kimono, I knew he was Japanese. I was very panicked at the time, so I did not pay much attention to what happened afterwards. However, there were also three children next to the person who fell to the ground. Because it was already dark, I could not recognize the faces of the two suspicious Chinese men. At this point, the court asked "Men Hiroshi" to testify. He stated that he was 23 years old, Japanese, and resided at No. 731 Diswei Road.</p>
<p>On July 10th of this year, at 8 p.m., I heard a gunshot and saw a flash of light, as well as children crying, in an apartment at the corner of Diswei Road and Qimei Road. I could not clearly see anything else. At this point, the court asked "Kuriki Kintaro" to testify. He stated that he was 59 years old, from Tokyo, Japan, formerly resided on Diswei Road, and currently resided at No. 10022 North Sichuan Road. He ran a barber shop. That day around 8 p.m., I came out alone. Because I was crossing the road, a car drove by very dangerously, so my wife was worried and followed behind me. I heard a gunshot and was very scared. I did not know what was happening. Later, I saw many Chinese people passing by. I only saw one person who was very strange</p>
<p>carrying something as they left. At this point, the court asked "Sugiyama Kiya," who brought two children, to testify. He stated that he was 39 years old, from Kobe, Japan, and resided on Qimei Road. My husband works at a bank. Xiansheng Mining and my family are neighbors with back-to-back doors. On July 10th, Xiansheng took Kitayama's child out and met me at the entrance of the alley. He immediately took my two children with him to play together. After they left, a Chinese man riding a bicycle, whom I knew, said that a Japanese person had been beaten to death while carrying three children. I don't know what this Chinese man was called. I went with Mrs. Xiansheng to see. My younger child was already being held by an unknown Chinese nanny, and the older child ran over and said, "Uncle</p>
<p>has been beaten to death." At that time, Mrs. Xiansheng and Mrs. Zishan took Xiansheng to the hospital. I took the child home. Mrs. Xiansheng has now returned to her country. At this point, the court asked "Zishan Mazaniya" to testify. He stated that he was 38 years old, from Kobe, Japan, and resided at No. 4 Aesili, Qimei Road. He ran a grocery store and was a neighbor of Xiansheng. On July 10th at 8 p.m., Xiansheng came out of his house and took my 5-year-old child out. Mrs. Sugiyama and I were talking at the entrance of the alley when a Chinese man riding a bicycle passed by and told us that a Japanese person had been beaten to death while carrying three children. We thought it might be Xiansheng, so we went to see. Sure enough, Xiansheng was lying on the ground. I don't know what happened. I saw that he</p>
<p>was bleeding from his mouth, so I accompanied Mrs. Xiansheng to the hospital. The doctor came to examine the wound and said he had been shot. The court asked if Xiansheng usually liked to drink and gamble. The witness replied, "He was a very good person." The court asked if he had affairs in addition to his wife. The witness replied, "I don't know about that. I only know that he and his wife had a very good relationship." The court asked if his wife often went out. The witness replied, "Absolutely not. If she went out, she would always go with Xiansheng." The court asked if he and Xiansheng were married. The witness replied, "No." The court asked if Xiansheng had any other enemies. The witness replied, "He was a very good person. He never argued with anyone, so he had no enemies." At this point, because it was past noon, the court ordered that the interrogation continue at 2 p.m.</p>
<p>However, because the defendant Zhao Yunhong presented a rebuttal, the bailiffs were ordered to keep the defendants separated to prevent collusion. At 2 p.m., the court resumed and interrogated Mao Yonghu. Mao Yonghu stated that he was 29 years old, from Siyang, and that Wang Zhensheng fired the gun to kill the Japanese person. Wang Zhensheng stated that he was 20 years old, from Chaoxian, Anhui, and that on the night of July 10th, Mao Yonghu took the handgun and shot the Japanese person. That Japanese person was very young. After firing the gun, he gave the gun to Mao and it was thrown into the garbage bin at the Hu Family Wood Bridge. At this point, Zhao Yunhong stated that he went to Shanghai from Nantong in May. He met Mao Yonghu on the transportation wharf and gave him a piece of luggage and a rattan suitcase to be delivered to his</p>
<p>sister and brother-in-law. Unexpectedly, Mao Yonghu pawned it in three different places. One place was near the Slanting Bridge, one was near the Xinkai River, and one was near the Sixteenth Pier. I don't remember the names of the pawnshops. I looked for him for more than ten days but did not see him. Later, Li Ruiwu came to my sister's place to look for me and asked me where Mao Yonghu lived. After searching twice, about four or five days later, I happened to meet him in a bathhouse at the Sixteenth Pier. I told him that Li Ruiwu was looking for him. I did not hear about how they killed people later. On July 11th, the 60 yuan that the Chinese Merchants Hotel gave me was to redeem the items that were pawned. The pawn tickets were sent over a few days after I had obtained the receipted money, the items</p>
<p>were redeemed by my brother-in-law.. The court proceeded to carefully examine the material, quality, and pattern of his clothes and luggage. Mao Yonghu was brought to the court, and he stated that he did not see what was inside the luggage, suitcase, and package that were pawned, and he did not see it clearly when he went to the pawnshop, and even claimed that he pawned it all at Xinkai River. The pawn ticket was returned to Zhao Xuehong on the third day. He had met with Zhao two or three times in between Li Ruiwu come to find him. At this point, the court ordered all the defendants to be brought to the court together. Jin Daoquan stated that although he had eaten with Li Ruiwu and Mao Yonghu in the restaurant, he did not participate in any discussions and</p>
<p>did not know the inside story. Being arrested at the Jiande Apartment was because Huake had asked me to take care of his friend, etc. Zhu Guisheng stated that he was 39 years old, from Yangzhou, and went to the Jiande Apartment on August 3rd. The court asked if he was preparing to attack another Japanese person. He replied, "No. Shi Jinshan had asked me to go. Shi is at the Public Security Bureau, and it would not be difficult to summon him." The court said, "This court has checked, and he is not at the Public Security Bureau." He replied, "I saw him." The court asked, "Did you go to No. 10 to attack the Japanese person?" He replied, "Please let the court rely on our statements or eye-witness reports." At this point, Chen Enming stated that he was 32 years old and knew nothing. At this point, Wang Zaishi stated that she was 20 years old and was Wang Zhenxi's concubine. The gun was</p>
<p>given to me once, but I don't know what was going on. At this point, Zhang Mashi stated that she was 33 years old, from Qingjiang. Because of a quarrel with her husband in August, she took her child back to Jiangbei. She met Mao Yonghu on the transport ship, who stuffed the gun into the diaper and took my diaper. I knew nothing about it at all. The court questioned Mao Yonghu who stated that he was reselling handguns with Shi Laoda. Because of the inspection on the ship, he stuffed it into the diaper. As for the handgun that accidentally fired when it was used to open the gun, it has been returned to Li Ruiwu. At this point, the court ordered the debate to begin. The prosecutor Zheng lifted his hand to give his opinion, and lawyer Yu Chengxiu then stated that he had opinions to present before the defense, saying that in this case of murder, the victim's</p>
<p>harm, the reasons for harm, and the victim's body were only presented in the postmortem report issued by the Fumin Hospital in conjunction with the Japanese Consulate. There was no inspection by the prosecutor, so the exact state of the matter was lacking. Therefore, as a preliminary matter, the procedural aspects should be carefully examined. Secondly, the statements of the witnesses in this case are post-event statements, and the report of the Public Security Bureau is also post-event. The only evidence is a handgun and the defendant's confession. However, the handgun was discovered a long time after the crime, which is very suspicious. The 32-caliber six-shot handgun is similar in many respects. The gun has been sent to the Forensic Medicine Research Institute for testing at the prosecutor's office. However, whether the bullets on file can be matched to this gun should be</p>
<p>tested once. Otherwise, the gun is a gun and the bullets are bullets. How can a final verdict be reached? At this point, lawyer Yu Zhongluo also stated that in the report of Section Chief Huang of the Third Section of the Public Security Bureau, the important witness Sun Zhongshan said in his statement on July 16th that the deceased fell backward. However, the inspection report stated that it went in the back of the brain, which would naturally cause the body to fall forward. Sun Zhongshan's statement also said that he went to help the deceased. There is also a record of the on-site demonstration of this statement by Sun Zhongshan on July 18th. The circumstances of this case are contradictory and should be carefully investigated. Therefore, it seems too early to begin the debate today, etc. After deliberation by the officials in court, they accepted the lawyers' opinions, approved a change of date for further investigation, and then concluded the trial. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Repeated Major Crimes in Tianjin and Beijing: A Large Group of Russian Master Thieves Flee to Shanghai, Arrested by the Police, Confiscated Military Weapons and Equipment for Burning Safes, Thieves Prepared Cars on a Grand Scale, Their Goal Seems to Be Banks in the Beijing-Shanghai Area</h3>
<p>Recently, a large number of Russian master thieves, who have committed major crimes in Tianjin and Beijing, fled to Shanghai, attempting to continue their activities. Public Concession General Patrol Superintendent Oxeniukoff, Detective Los, Detective Babeining, Chinese Detectives Li Jincheng, Wang Bocheng, Zhu Jiaxin, etc., started a search and arrest at about 1 a.m. yesterday, which continued until dawn. A total of seven Russians were arrested: (1) An Tangtianshafu, (2) Li Ke Nashifu, (3) Li Wen Fattianfu, (4) Ke Shi Mai Bao Luding, (5) Mai Mi Kang Katersianshi, (6) Di Mi Tuo Li Dutianfu, (7) Di Mi Tuo Li Paikefu (hereinafter referred to as Defendant No. X), and the following were confiscated:</p>
<p>Five pistols, one hundred and eighty-five rounds of ammunition, various iron tools and equipment for burning open safes and walls, forged car permits, a car, etc., in large quantities. The scale of the preparations and the completeness of the equipment can be described as unprecedented. At 10:30 a.m., they were escorted to the First Special District Court's Criminal Division, where Judge Feng Shide opened the court for interrogation. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated that because the defendants in this case had just been arrested, a detailed investigation had not yet been conducted, so he requested permission for a two-week detention for investigation. He then described the circumstances of the case, stating that the defendants in this case, due to</p>
<p>repeated offenses in Tianjin and other places, had recently fled to Shanghai. After the Shanghai police authorities received this report, the Public Concession Police instructed personnel to pay close attention to the actions of the suspects for a long time. Now, because the suspects' behavior became increasingly suspicious, and it was discovered that they drove the prepared car No. 8347 out late last night. Because the car's parts were damaged, they hired another car and drove back to the car storage place at No. 227 Nanyang Road. At that time, police detectives arrested Defendants 1, 2, 3, and 4. Inside the house,</p>
<p>a car permit No. 6740 issued by the Municipal Government was found, in which the character "7" was changed to "8" with stone powder, becoming No. 6840, and a completely forged permit No. 6840 was also found. In addition, there was a bundle of bamboo poles, which, when connected, would become an extremely long bamboo ladder, as well as iron hammers, iron bars, iron chains, steel saws, ropes, and other items used for theft. It was found that Defendants 2 and 3 were the sons of Defendant 1, and Defendant 5 was also an accomplice. Defendants 1, 2, and 4 lived at No. 440 Shibazi Road, while Defendant 5 lived separately at</p>
<p>No. 140 Henry Road. When a search was conducted at No. 440 Shibazi Road, an application form for a car license to the Public Works Department and a detailed map of Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Ningbo were found. From this, it can be seen that their criminal destination was not limited to Shanghai alone. Later, the detectives arrested Defendant 5 at No. 664 Lafayette Road, but a pair of leather shoes were found, completely wet, which could prove that Defendant 5 had just returned home from outside. Then, Defendants 6 and 7 were arrested at No. 5, Lane 14, Lafayette Road. Five pistols, one hundred and eighty-five rounds of ammunition, and</p>
<p>many pieces of machinery for burning walls and safes were found at that location. A pair of Defendant 6's undershorts was also found, with the legs completely soaked in water, still wet, indicating that he had also just returned home from outside. Because it rained heavily last night, this was the case. Defendant 7 had previously been sentenced to more than four years and six months for committing a crime. The elaborate organization and complete equipment of the defendants suggest that their planned target for robbery was definitely not ordinary households, but rather</p>
<p>banks in the Beijing-Shanghai area. The scope of the police's investigation is very broad, so although they requested permission for a two-week detention, they may have to request an extension at that time, etc. After submitting the confiscated evidence to the court, Judge Feng approved the detention after questioning and set the date for further interrogation at 2:00 p.m. on the 24th of this month.</p>
<h3>Shanghai South Public Bus Robbed Last Night, All Five Passengers Suffered Losses</h3>
<p>The Shanghai South Public Bus was robbed on the night of September 7 while passing near Luban Road and Kangqu Road. All passengers, drivers, and conductors suffered losses. Subsequently, Liu Guangjun, the leader of the Ximen Detective Squad, cracked the gang of six bandits and handed them over to the law. Unexpectedly, a similar incident occurred again last night at 6:50 p.m. The No. 11 Shanghai South Public Bus, driven by driver No. 385 and conductor No. 174, was traveling from Longhua to Lao Ximen. At the intersection of Kangqu Road and Luban Road, a passenger boarded the bus at the station, followed by a man wearing a navy blue military uniform, a velvet sports cap, and a black overcoat, about 30 years old, with a Shandong accent; a man wearing a blue short coat, about 20 years old; and a man wearing a black gown, about 40 years old. The three men boarded the bus one after another. Suddenly, the man in the military uniform took out a box cannon, monitoring the driver and telling him to drive. The other two thieves also drew their guns, threatening everyone in the car to remain silent. Then, they searched and robbed the passengers one by one. At that time, there were only three passengers in the car. Passenger Zhao Huifeng (resident of Tianyaoqiao Road) was robbed of 20 yuan in cash, four dimes, and copper coins, etc. Zhou Kaisun (resident of 520 Longhua Road) was robbed of 18 yuan and 90 cents in cash, a pocket watch, and an unidentified passenger. The driver and conductor were also robbed of their wristwatches. The three thieves took the loot and got off the bus at the original location, disappearing without a trace in the direction of Luban Road.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Xinzha Road Yesterday</h3>
<p>At about 10 a.m. yesterday, two robbers broke into No. 1656 Xinzha Road, each holding a handgun.

They ransacked the boxes and chests, and as a result, robbed a diamond ring, gold bracelet, watch chain, camera, and cash, estimated to be worth more than 1,000 yuan. They fled with the stolen goods. Afterwards, the owner provided a list of the stolen items and reported it to the Xinzha Police Station for investigation.</p>

He was unable to avoid the train and was run over by the locomotive, his body cut in half, with blood splattered all over the ground, a gruesome sight. The night shift stationmaster immediately ordered the police to take care of the situation, notified the local security, and summoned relatives to identify and claim the body, reporting to the local court for an autopsy and burial.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, I recently read in the news column of your newspaper on the 9th of this month that "The real estate industry is declining, wealthy people have become destitute, involving Yang Qingsheng, the local manager of Puyi Real Estate Company, who lives in the French Concession of Shanghai West. He previously had assets worth nearly ten million, but unexpectedly, he went bankrupt due to the collapse of the Meifeng Bank, resulting in a wealthy man with assets of thousands of millions becoming a poor man with not a penny to his name. All of his real estate has been seized by creditors, and only a residence in the French Concession worth 10,000 to 20,000 yuan has been seized by the court," etc. I was very surprised after reading this. I, the undersigned, have been running Puyi Real Estate for more than ten years. It is obvious that someone is damaging the reputation of all the Zhengjian real estate merchants in the city. I am deeply afraid of confusing rumors, so I have sent a letter specifically requesting a correction. Respectfully, Yang Qiusun, Chinese Manager of Puyi Real Estate Company, December 10.</p>

<h3>French Journalist Croc-Lochte's Forged Passport Lawsuit Continues: Verdict Scheduled for Saturday or Sunday</h3>
<p>The Great American Evening Post reported that French journalist Croc-Lochte, who was arrested in Beiping two months ago and escorted to Shanghai on charges of forging a passport, was interrogated again yesterday morning (the 10th) by Mr. Kaufmann, the president of the French Consular Court. The circumstances of the case are very bizarre. Yesterday morning, Mr. Kaufmann asked the defendant, "You claim to have suffered from amnesia in 1920. How can someone who does not remember the first 34 years of his life write as well as you? If you do not remember the situation before 1920, how can you retain the knowledge you have today?" Mr. Kaufmann also declared in court that he was unable to determine whether Croc-Lochte was the defendant's real name, because according to Croc's statement, he suffered from amnesia in 1920, and he does not remember anything about his early life. Croc may have falsely claimed to have suffered from this disease to start a new life. It has recently been discovered that in 1920, when the Red and White Russian armies fought near Moscow, a person with serious abdominal injuries was seized on the battlefield. There was an identity card in his pocket, with the surname Henry Le Croc-Lochte. After the person was treated and recovered in the hospital, he proved to have extensive medical knowledge. He (the president) investigated at various French medical schools to see if anyone of this name had studied in the schools, but he did not find anyone. Therefore, whether Croc-Lochte is truly a French citizen is still a question. After Croc left Russia and entered France, he no longer remembered his life situation before 1920. He then went to Vietnam, where he quickly won the reputation of a journalist, scientist, and authority on local tribes. In 1923, Mr. Croc returned to France, but left not long after. Observers were surprised by Mr. Kaufmann's words. Mr. Kaufmann continued to say to the defendant, "No matter what eloquent words you use, the facts cannot be concealed. You knew the passport was a forgery, but you still sent it to the consular authorities to ask if it could be exchanged for a new one. This is the crime you committed. As for the passport being planted in your luggage by someone else, this statement is not credible, and I will not ask about its truth or falsehood." Yesterday morning, the defendant still insisted that he had not forged the passport. According to the passport, it originally belonged to Mr. Marsas. His name was erased and the name Croc-Lochte was filled in. Then, the defendant's lawyer, Da Shangfa, eloquently stated that his client did not intend to use the forged passport after finding it in his luggage. If the defendant wanted to escape, he could have escaped to "Manchukuo." The defendant did not destroy the passport, although the reason for this is unclear, but this is not a crime. The defendant has been imprisoned for 76 days due to a temporary mistake and has been on a hunger strike for 35 days. Please, Your Honor, be lenient, etc. It is heard that the verdict in this case will be handed down on Saturday or Sunday of this week. According to Croc, if he is found guilty, he will appeal to the Saigon High Court.</p>

<h3>The 11th Jiangsu-Zhejiang Private Middle School Soccer and Basketball Championships Opened Yesterday: Soccer Preliminaries Ended, Quarterfinals and Consolation Matches Begin Today, Basketball Defending Double Champions Jinling Team Lost Both Games Yesterday</h3>
<p>The 11th Jiangsu-Zhejiang Private Middle School Soccer and Basketball Championships opened yesterday at the Johann Middle School in Shanghai's Fanhuangdu. Seven schools participated in soccer and six schools participated in basketball. The basketball competition uses a single round-robin system. One-fifth of the schedule was completed yesterday. Both Hujiang and Johann have won both of their games and have the best chance of winning the championship. The Jinling team, which won the double soccer and basketball championship in the previous year, was defeated by both Johann and Hujiang in both games yesterday. The soccer competition uses an elimination system. The preliminary round ended yesterday. Today, the quarterfinals and consolation matches will begin. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Today's Schedule</p>
<p>Soccer</p>
<p>Hujiang vs. Taowu (Consolation) 9:00 AM</p>
<p>Mingqiang vs. ? (Consolation) 9:30 AM</p>
<p>Johann vs. Yancheng (Quarterfinal) 1:30 PM</p>
<p>Zhejiang vs. Jinling (Quarterfinal) 3:00 PM</p>

<p>Zhejiang vs. Johann 4:00 PM</p>
<p>Dongwu vs. Jinling 5:00 PM</p>
<p>Mingqiang vs. Hujiang 6:00 PM</p>
<p>Yesterday's Results</p>
<p>Soccer</p>
<p>Yesterday, the three soccer matches were all preliminary round games. As a result of the competition, Johann, Yancheng, and Zhejiang advanced to the quarterfinal week. At the same time, Hujiang, Taowu, and Mingqiang, which were eliminated, also began competing for the runner-up. The defending champion, Jinling, had a bye in the preliminary round. Today, they will meet Zhejiang in the quarterfinals. If Zhejiang wins, Jinling will play Mingqiang in the consolation match. Otherwise, Zhejiang will not be eligible to meet Mingqiang again, and Mingqiang will enter the quarterfinal week of the consolation match without any effort. However, Jinling has a very high chance of winning today and is very confident in winning the championship. Johann is also very ambitious and has the advantage of being the home team. In the future, the championship and runner-up will definitely be contested by these two teams. Yesterday's results are as follows:</p>
<p>Johann defeated Hujiang 8-1</p>
<p>Yancheng defeated Taowu 3-1</p>
<p>Zhejiang defeated Mingqiang 4-2</p>
<p>Basketball</p>
<p>There were a total of six basketball games yesterday, so each school has played twice and completed two-ninths of their schedule. Among the teams, Zhejiang is relatively weak, Mingqiang has good skills but lacks experience, and Dongwu is average. The best teams are Hujiang, Johann, and Jinling. Jinling is the defending double champion, although they lost both games yesterday. However, they played against two strong teams, Hujiang and Johann. What they lacked was defense. The two Guo and one Jiang in the frontcourt are very accurate in their shots and very sharp in their passes. Their loss to Hujiang was due to their inferior defense, and their loss to Johann was due to their planning. When Jinling met Johann, Jinling took the lead. In the first half, they led by 19-14. The largest difference was as much as eight points. However, during the game, they focused on offense and neglected defense, resulting in a loss of twelve points. By the time they realized this, Johann had already secured the victory. Center Guo Zhaoying, who is best at shooting, was closely guarded by Johann and could not shoot, resulting in a reversal of the situation. Johann's guard, Shen Ji'en, is able to penetrate and shoot, and he made a great contribution in yesterday's game. In the future, he may become the second Xu Wenkui. However, the team's experience does not seem to be pure yet. When the score was 39-28, there were only four minutes left in the game. Victory was in hand, and they should have focused on defense, but they still focused on offense, allowing Jinling's left and right forwards to score eight more points, almost being overtaken. Because of the championship, the cheerleaders on both sides were very active, cheering for their respective teams. It was not unique to them, the defeat of Mingqiang to Dongwu was the same as Jinling's. Mingqiang led by 16-6 in the first half. After that, their defense was neglected, and they lost 22-25. Currently, the situation of each school is that Hujiang and Johann are tied with two wins and two losses, Dongwu and Mingqiang each have one win and one loss, and Jinling and Zhejiang each have two losses and two losses. However, it is predicted that Jinling has a very high chance of winning against Dongwu and Mingqiang in the future.</p>
<p>Mingqiang defeated Zhejiang 38-19</p>
<p>Johann defeated Dongwu 45-18</p>
<p>Hujiang defeated Jinling 42-31</p>
<p>Hujiang defeated Zhejiang 45-21</p>
<p>Dongwu defeated Mingqiang 25-22</p>
<p>Johann defeated Jinling 43-36</p>
<h3>West Qing Basketball: St. John's Defeats Shanghai, Qing Guang Wins Against Hornets in Overtime, Xin Team to Play Mai Lingjia Tonight</h3>
<p>Due to order rearrangements and misunderstandings last night, the West Qing Basketball games did not start until 9 p.m. The first game, in the university division, saw Shanghai players aggressively attacking, leaving their defense vulnerable. St. John's capitalized, leading 25-9 at halftime. In the second half, Shanghai rallied, gradually improving their coordination in attack and defense, and regaining their original strength. However, the deficit from the first half was too great, and although they tied the second half 19-19, they ultimately lost 44-28. The Shanghai team, which had previously defeated Chi Chih, succumbed to the previously lackluster St. John's team. In the independent division, the Hornets and Qing Guang took the court. After Qing Guang opened the scoring, the Hornets quickly took an 11-2 lead. However, their momentum was short-lived, and Qing Guang surged ahead, taking a 17-16 lead at halftime. In the second half, Qing Guang extended their lead to 31-23. The Hornets then showed renewed vigor, aggressively catching up to 31-31. With time running out, a nine-minute overtime was played. Qing Guang's Zhang Qu and Liang quickly added five points. The Hornets' Zou Zichen made a shot, but soon after, Liang Guoquan scored again, securing a 38-33 victory for Qing Guang. Games will begin at 7:45 tonight, with one game each in the general university and independent divisions. The match between Xin Team and Mai Lingjia is expected to be intense.

<h3>Shooting League: China Youth Currently Holds Advantage, Zhu Qiliang to Compete Tonight</h3>
<p>In the Shanghai Amateur Shooting Team League, China Youth Association and the Race Club have clashed in four matches. China Youth Association has a total lead of 259 points. Tonight at 9 p.m., renowned marksman Zhu Qiliang will compete. Zhu was last year's Group B champion and has recently made significant progress, becoming a first-class marksman. He will face Shamborek from the Race Club. Shamborek is a dangerous figure in Group A. Their encounter is sure to be a spectacular performance.</p>
<p>Fang Yide's performance last night at 5 p.m. was indeed astonishing. His highest score of 47 points in one shot was the foundation of his victory. The 47 points were earned due to his accurate shooting, proper control, and appropriate strategy. His opponent, Harold, was under his control and unable to develop his skills. This was due to a lack of skill. Last night's score was Fang Yide 300, Harold 191. After four matches, China Youth Association has a total lead of 159 points.</p>
<h3>Handball Match Day 1: Qing Xing Defeats West Qing. The Qing Xing Handball Team</h3>

Results and schedule are as follows:</p>
<h3>First Session of the Shanghai Transportation Sports Federation: Qing Xing Defeats West Qing</h3>
<p>The first basketball competition organized by the Shanghai Transportation Sports Federation of the Ministry of Transportation has been ongoing for two months. The spirit of each team is quite full and the mood is extremely warm. Now all of them have ended. The Association recently held a banquet at Wanli Restaurant to entertain all sectors and directors and supervisors. It is heard that the Association is currently preparing to publish an annual magazine, and the members' general meeting will be held next spring to re-elect directors and supervisors. The table on the left shows the results of the first basketball game organized by the Association.</p>
<h3>Liangjiang Basketball Team Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School basketball team, led by Zhang Yuansheng, arrived in Hankou on the 5th. Many people from the Wuhan sports community and alumni of the school welcomed them at the wharf. The Wuhan Sports Association hosted a dinner at the YMCA. In addition to the general team leader Zhang Yuansheng, the entire team stayed at the YWCA. It is reported that the competition schedule is set for the 6th against the Xin Mian Team, the 7th against the Wuhan Team, the 8th against the Qing Guang Team, and the 9th against the No. 2 Women's High School, and then travel to Hunan, Jiangxi and Anhui for sightseeing.</p>
<h3>Our Nation's "Sports Ambassador" Huang Bochang</h3>
<p>— Huai Qing</p>
<p>A model of a nation weighing 215 pounds.  Invincible in wrestling across Europe and the United States.</p>
<p>He perfectly fits the standard of a "burly man," a rare giant in China, who has been invincible in wrestling across Europe and the United States, and is internationally renowned. He is Mr. Huang Bochang, a Chinese-American and our country's sports ambassador.</p>
<p>The Shanghai crowd who love sports competitions probably don't know enough about this giant Huang Bochang, a Chinese national! When he performed in Shanghai for the first time this April, defeating the Philippine champion Aquinaldo, few people paid attention to this matter. However, the foreigners in Shanghai were very surprised that China had such a wrestling master! This shows the difference in sports interest between Chinese and Western crowds. The reason is that people do not fully understand how Mr. Huang has recently returned to China and how his skills are. Now he is going to perform for the second time, next Tuesday (the 15th) against India's most famous wrestler Mehar, in the St. George's arena.</p>
<p>This is the first time he has returned to his motherland. In Hong Kong, he once fought against Aquinaldo, and the referee helped him judge Aquinaldo to win. The two agreed to come to Shanghai for a second fight, which was performed at St. George's on the evening of the 4th. Mr. Huang easily defeated Aquinaldo and avenged the defeat in Hong Kong. Indian famous player Mehar previously announced that he would challenge the winner of the two. Therefore, Mr. Huang was elected to fight with Mehar. Mehar is India's most famous wrestling master. In the past year or two, he has traveled around and has never met an opponent. He weighs 218 pounds. Mr. Huang weighs 215 pounds. This battle is definitely more confident for Mehar. However, according to Mr. Huang, he must fight with him. It is not certain who will win. But according to Mr. Huang's past achievements, it is not difficult to defeat this invincible Indian hero!</p>
<p>Mr. Huang is 31 years old this year. He has a tiger's waist and ape's arms. His body is much larger than ordinary people. His hair is black and sets off his fair skin, which makes his eyebrows and eyes appear more clear and beautiful. He was born in Chicago on January 11, 1906. His ancestral home is Xinhui, Guangdong. His father's name is Huang Bingbai (the transliteration of the three words Wong Bing Pock). He only had one son, Huang Bochang; he had two daughters, both of whom were married.</p>
<p>He loved sports since he was a child and was fascinated by Western boxing. He often practiced with his classmates in his spare time and was famous for his boxing fights in school for a time. Later, he changed to wrestling, learning the American style. With his strong physique and unique sports talent, he concentrated on training and made great progress in his skills, becoming a famous strongman and winning many championships. He studied dentistry at Northwestern University in Chicago. Unfortunately, his parents died and he dropped out of school, otherwise he would have become a dentist. Since then, he has become a professional wrestler.</p>
<p>In the past seven years, he has traveled to major cities such as Honolulu, San Francisco, New Zealand, Australia, and Canada, competing hundreds of times and failing less than ten times. Moreover, in Australia, San Francisco, and other places, many world-famous wrestling championships have been defeated by him; these many glorious achievements have spread his reputation to the European and American continents.</p>
<p>Of course, he speaks fluent American, but he can also speak Cantonese. He can eat Chinese food with chopsticks like us, unlike other overseas Chinese who do not know the national conditions of the motherland at all. He has been married in the United States. But it has been separated. He is willing to return to his motherland for a long time and live in Shanghai for a long time. He is willing to devote himself to wrestling and is very willing to guide young people, so that everyone has a strong physique and strong strength, and reserves talents for the country.</p>
<p>Mr. Huang is indeed a sports ambassador for our country and a model of the nation. He fought alone overseas and won the admiration of foreigners.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the fifteenth, he will perform for the second time, still at St. George's. Tickets are divided into four yuan, three yuan, two yuan, etc.</p>
<p>Finally, I will briefly introduce the rules of wrestling as follows. The victory or defeat of each game is determined by a three-game two-win system. Knocking the opponent down on the ground for three seconds; throwing the opponent out of the ring; knocking the opponent down with the forearm and not getting up for ten seconds; holding the opponent's head with the arm, making them faint and unable to resist; these are all counted as one win. But punching and kicking are not allowed, and it is even more forbidden to hold the throat. Usually ten minutes is a round, with a one-minute break in between. If the two sides do not divide the victory or defeat, they will compete in seven rounds (seventy minutes, plus seven breaks, for a total of seventy-seven minutes). To determine the final result.</p>

<h3>President of the International Historical Society, Tian Bo Lie, Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday. Scheduled to Visit Mayor Wu This Morning and Pay Tribute to Huang Fu. Tonight, Various Organizations in the City Host a Public Banquet at the YMCA.</h3>
<p>Professor Tian Bo Lie, President of the International Historical Society, visited Zhang Qun, Wang Shijie, Zhu Jiahua, Weng Wenhao, Ma Chaojun, and Luo Jialun in Beijing. Yesterday, accompanied by Kang Xuan Yi, a member of the Standing Committee of the Great Education Union, he toured Suzhou and Wuxi, and arrived in Shanghai in the afternoon. In Wuxi, Sun Yuanliang, commander of the 88th Division of the local garrison, and his wife hosted a banquet on Taihu Lake and notified the military police along the way to take care of them. Dozens of organizations in this city, including the Great Education Union, the Chinese Academic Society, the Institute of International Affairs, the Global Students Association, the Sino-Foreign Cultural Association, the International Education Association, the Peking University Alumni Association, and the Association of Professors and Writers, will host a public banquet for Mr. Tian at 6 p.m. tonight in the Western-style dining room on the 9th floor of the YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge.

In addition, Mr. Tian will give a public lecture at 4:30 p.m. on Saturday, the 12th, in the auditorium of the YMCA, entitled "The League of Nations and the World Situation."</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province's Budget for Education and Culture in the 25th Year: Estimated at Over 2.83 Million Yuan, an Increase of Over 311,400 Yuan Compared to the Previous Year.</h3>
<p>The budget for education and culture in Zhejiang Province in the 25th year has been increased slightly compared to the previous year. The reasons for the necessary increase are as follows:</p>
<p>1. The number of high and junior high schools (including middle school normal schools and vocational schools) has naturally increased by 17 classes. In addition, all simplified normal schools and junior vocational schools have added Boy Scout training, so expenses have increased accordingly.</p>
<p>2. Meal subsidies for normal school students and experimental agricultural school students are issued based on the actual number of students. The number of people and classes has increased this year, so meal subsidies must also be increased.</p>
<p>3. In the past, this province followed the original purpose of the Provisional Constitution and the order of the Ministry of Education to set up scholarships and grants to help the poor and reward diligence. Now, following the orders of the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Education, from the 25th year onwards, each school should set up free places and public expense places. In addition to scholarships, which will still be set up as before, and second- and third-year students will still be handled according to the grant method, freshmen will be set up with free and public expense places respectively in accordance with the regulations (see the explanation of revenue for free places). Because the number of students has increased and the number of public expenses granted is handled according to the Ministry's regulations, this item of expenses must be increased this year.</p>
<p>4. Subsidies for private secondary schools jointly run by counties and cities have been increased because the number of subsidized schools approved in accordance with the subsidy regulations has increased, so expenses have been increased.</p>
<p>5. The number of classes in provincial secondary schools has increased this year. The original buildings and equipment are insufficient, and must be built and purchased separately. In addition, some schools must be rebuilt due to the age of the school buildings, so the temporary expenses for the construction and equipment of each school this year have increased significantly.</p>
<p>Based on the above facts, the current budget for this year is 2,554,837 yuan, which is 177,029 yuan more than the 1,377,808 yuan listed in the previous year (including 140,000 yuan for compulsory education expenses, which were drawn from the general reserve fund. The original budget was 2,237,808 yuan. Because 140,000 yuan was added, it is the above number.) The temporary budget is 280,500 yuan, which is 137,464 yuan more than the 143,036 yuan listed in the previous year. The combined current and temporary budget is 2,835,337 yuan, which is 314,493 yuan more than the 2,520,844 yuan listed in the previous year.</p>
<h3>Sun Yat-sen Cultural and Educational Center Solicits Essays on Party Doctrine. Deadline is at the End of This Month; Invalid After the Deadline. More Than 2,000 Yuan Allocated for Prizes.</h3>
<p>The Sun Yat-sen Cultural and Educational Center, in order to promote Sun Yat-sen's doctrines and encourage young people to conduct research, has decided to hold a national essay competition on the Three Principles of the People for universities, middle schools, and primary schools every year. This year, it has allocated more than 2,000 yuan to hold a university essay competition on the Three Principles of the People. The essays are divided into three categories: Nationalism, Democracy, and People's Livelihood. Ten winners will be selected for each category. The first-place winner will receive a prize of 200 yuan, the second-place winner will receive a prize of 100 yuan, the third-place winner will receive a prize of 50 yuan, the fourth-place winner will receive a prize of 40 yuan, the fifth-place winner will receive a prize of 30 yuan, and the sixth- to tenth-place winners will each receive a prize of 20 yuan. Previously, it sent letters to all universities in the country to inform their students to participate. Now that the deadline for submission is approaching, it has sent letters to all universities to inform them again. The original letter is as follows: Our center intends to formulate methods for awarding prizes for essays on the Three Principles of the People in order to encourage research and promote Sun Yat-sen's doctrines and theories. We previously sent a letter inviting students from your school to participate and requested that the essays be submitted to the center by the end of December this year for review. In view of the fact that this matter is related to academic research, students will surely participate enthusiastically under your school's encouragement. Now that the date is approaching, we are writing again to ask you to pay attention to it. We hope that you will investigate and handle it accordingly.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: The End of the Year is Approaching. Recent Yarn has Rebounds. Profit Takers Rush to Close.</h3>
<p>The yarn market trend is moderate, mainly because the end of the year is approaching, and it is a commercial custom to close accounts once. When the market stabilizes, profit takers rush to close their positions. Moreover, the current yarn sales market also feels stagnant, and people's minds are relatively calm. However, they still do not give up on tightening the far-term contracts, but they release the near-term contracts and hedge into the far-term contracts. Therefore, the recent rise in the near-term contracts the day before yesterday was particularly strong, but today the decline is also dramatic. In short, the root cause is still to see the progress and retreat of current sales.</p>
<p>The Yarn Auction Trade Tends to Sell</p>
<p>At the opening of the previous yarn auction market, the December contract was still strong due to the lingering strength of the previous day. However, when it came to the far-term contracts, a certain household took the opportunity to release a huge amount of yarn, causing the market to loosen and fall. In the second round, the near-month contracts were slightly higher, while the far-term contracts remained flat. In the third round, the December contract plummeted by three yuan, because the yarn sales were sluggish, and most traders tended to sell, so the pressure was still heavy, and the far-month contracts were still flat. By the close of the market, the near-month contracts were calm, and the far-month contracts did not move. The results of the yarn auction showed that the prices of each month fell by 1.4 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day, except for the March contract, which fell by only 0.5 yuan. In the afternoon opening, the near-term contracts were calm, and the far-term contracts were slightly higher. It is probably that some contracts have been rolled over. At the same time, the current yarn trade was dull, with only 490 bales traded. As a result, the December/January contracts fell by another 2.6 yuan compared to the morning closing price, and the far-term contracts rose by 1 yuan to 1.1 yuan. It was found that Geng Feng sold 2,300 bales, Taixing 800 bales, Ren Feng 850 bales, Dachang Cheng 1,000 bales, Changfeng 1,700 bales, Dachang 1,250 bales, Yongda 1,400 bales, Tonghe 600 bales, Cheng 3,250 bales, and Hengde 1,100 bales. Hengyi bought 850 bales, Jifeng 1,000 bales, Jinxing 2,000 bales, Yuda 850 bales, Minghua 990 bales, Fengtai 800 bales, Shenji 1,650 bales, Taichang 1,650 bales, Fukang 1,300 bales, and Jinchang 1,300 bales. The comparison of the highest and lowest prices and closing prices in a day is as follows:</p>
<p>Current Yarn Sales Still Show No Improvement</p>
<p>It was found that a total of 410 bales were bought by various groups throughout the day, and the selling price fell by one yuan. The purchase amount of each group is as follows:</p>
<p>Inland 290, Counterparts 80, Anqing 5</p>
<p>Nanjing 10, Sichuan 55, Guangdong 50</p>
<h3>Speculators Shift Targets. Many Advisors in the Cotton Auction Market. Because the Yarn Price is Too High and the Margin is Too Large. It is Better to Abandon Yarn and Show Talent in the Cotton Market.</h3>
<p>The cotton market also experienced a surge, because farmers from all over the country held up the prices and refused to sell, and the arrival of goods decreased. Secondly, the US and Indian cotton markets turned upward. Recently, there has been discussion in the powder and wheat markets, and cotton and wheat have a related relationship. As a result, speculators shifted their targets to the cotton auction market.</p>
<p>Daily Rise of More Than Seven Corners</p>
<p>At the opening of the previous cotton auction market, the market price turned upward due to the unanimous rise in the US and Indian cotton markets, and some people were bullish on cotton prices, and the price ratio was too far from the yarn price, which aroused the interest of many parties. However, a certain gentleman took the opportunity to release a huge amount of stock when the price rose. As a result, the prices of each month rose by 0.45 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day. The market atmosphere was very strong at the afternoon opening, and the price advanced slowly. Retail investors realized that the yarn price was too high and the margin was too large, so their targets changed. When there were more buyers, the market soared, and the far-month contracts rose beyond 44 yuan. As a result, the prices of each month rose by another 0.25 yuan to 0.35 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Yuda sold 18,000 piculs, Tonghe 3,400 piculs, Juxing 3,800 piculs, Yikang 2,700 piculs, Jifeng 4,000 piculs, Changji 3,400 piculs, Daqing 2,200 piculs, Taixing 3,400 piculs, Shenchang 3,500 piculs, Tongfeng 3,200 piculs, Wang Taixing 22,800 piculs, Shengyuan 4,700 piculs, Yuanyi 4,100 piculs, Taichang 3,100 piculs, Xiecheng 2,000 piculs, and Yuanxingchang 1,900 piculs. Hengyi bought 6,000 piculs, Dafeng 6,100 piculs, Mingde 3,100 piculs, Runkang 11,900 piculs, Fukang 8,100 piculs, Yongda 2,700 piculs, Hexing 6,200 piculs, Gengfeng 16,300 piculs, Xingchang 6,100 piculs, Fengtai 6,400 piculs, Zhenda 3,400 piculs, Taichang 7,800 piculs, Yichang 4,100 piculs, and Fuyuan 4,600 piculs. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices in a day are listed on the left.</p>

<h3>American Cotton Industry Internal and External Purchases Surge</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened with each month rising five to eleven points. In the early morning, traders, brokers, and foreign firms all bought in, with Liverpool firms being the most active. New external customers also purchased after the government's estimate was released. Later, cotton farmers hedge sold and bulls closed out, resulting in a slight pullback. Eventually, traders bought in at limit prices, causing another rise. No delivery notices were issued for December contracts, so the December issue was quite firm. At closing, cooperatives sold, leading to a slight dip. Spot prices rose thirteen points, futures rose eleven to fourteen points. English cotton spot prices rose five points, futures rose twenty-three points. Indian cotton covered shorts encountered hedge selling, speculators bought in, and European exporters entered Oomra. Bulls closed out, resulting in Pingul rising 1.5 rupees, Oomra rising 1.75 rupees, and Broach rising 1.75 rupees. (Reuter's dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>According to a Bombay telegram, the opening forecast for the 10th was: Broach at 223 rupees, Oomra at 203.25 rupees, and Pingul at 164 rupees, all up 2.5 rupees.</p>
<p>Osaka telegram on the 10th: Yarn futures rose 1.10 to 1.80 yuan, with near-month at 247 yuan and far-month at 224.20 yuan. Cotton rose 0.45 to 0.60 yuan, with near-month at 68.60 yuan and far-month at 70 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Spot Cotton Cloth Still Feels Scarce. Customers Can Only Get Warehouse Receipts From Foreign Firms. Factory Receipts Cannot Be Obtained Until After the 20th.</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was sluggish, and the yarn market softened slightly. Eastern piece goods such as white cloth, drills, and grey cloth fell by about 5 cents per piece. Qingdao goods such as drills and twills arrived in Shanghai yesterday, only forty or fifty pieces. These were goods that were not completed during the strike. Customers are going to Japanese foreign firms to get their orders for this month, but can only get warehouse receipts from the foreign firms. Factory warehouse receipts can only be obtained after the 20th. Currently, foreign firms are gradually dispatching spot goods to the merchants, mostly selling them directly to other places, so the goods dispatched from warehouses daily are still very scarce. Cloth boats from Changzhou and Wuxi, which were delayed by rice boats, have arrived in Shanghai one after another in the past two days. All the goods have already been ordered, mostly by Guangdong merchants, who are reporting shipments for export. Spot goods are still very scarce. Drills, serge, and broadcloth prices are also generally stable. Printed cotton drills and serge were drawn in three hundred pieces from Hankou, Tianjin, and other places. The selling price of printed goods has not increased yet. Based on the current price of grey cloth, it is already not enough to cover costs, leading people to hope for improvement. Japanese firms such as Dongmian opened sales of February and March futures of fine cloth such as Dragon Head, Yanghe, and Auspicious brands, and spare pieces of 84 grey cloth and drills, at a price of about 10 cents per piece lower than this month's warehouse receipts.</p>
<h3>Many Outsiders Are Also Buying and Selling Woolens - This Shows How Good the Market Is -</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the retail and wholesale trading of woolens remained strong. The routes to this street and the Beijing-Hangzhou Road remained畅销. All kinds of seasonal thick goods were rising in price, overtly or covertly, and goods were scarce. Both insiders and outsiders understood this (this newspaper has reported it several times), so outsiders are also absorbing woolens, buying and selling them to make profits. There are many people doing so. The hot-selling goods in demand are mostly in short supply, especially 30-count cavalry twill, black and gray overcoating, evergreen plain thick broadcloth, Melton, etc.</p>
<h3>Grains: Flour and Wheat Fluctuate Unsteadily</h3>
<p>Wheat prices, after opening this morning, showed a pattern of rising first and then falling for each month. At the opening price, due to foreign quotations continuing to rise by about 5 to 7 jiao, people were excited and bid prices were strong. This month's price rose 7 fen compared to the previous day, while the price of February and below rose by 2 to 3 fen. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, people had softened, because flour prices had fallen back quite quickly, and it was rumored that another ship of foreign wheat had been fixed, which made people uneasy. Selling was quite prevalent, and in the end, this month's price did not rise or fall compared to the previous day, while January and below fell by 2 to 3 fen. The current wheat market remains stable, with Kaifeng Hyao Wan wheat at 6.65 yuan, Gaoyou wheat at 6.59 yuan, Tiantai wheat at 6.545 yuan, Wuhu wheat at 6.65 yuan, and Xiashi wheat at 6.5 yuan. Fuxin purchased 2,500 bags.</p>
<p>Flour prices, after opening this morning, showed an erratic pattern of rising and falling for each month. Because of the quotation for foreign wheat, Chicago rose 7 jiao and Canada rose 5 jiao, so after the opening price, people felt more expensive, and the buying interest was similar to the previous day. From this month to April, the price rose by 6 to 8 fen compared to the previous day, but by the second session, the market had fallen back again, because many long clients, at this high level, were selling continuously, and the power of buyers was relatively weak, so it fell back by 2 to 3 fen from the highest price. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, in the first session, it was rumored that another ship of foreign wheat had been fixed, priced at 5 jiao, so people were very soft. In the second session, outsiders absorbed again, and the market felt slightly rebounded, but after the third session, because long positions were coming back out sharply, it showed a small downward trend again. Currently, the market has huge breathing, and although the price of foreign wheat is expensive, purchases have already begun, so some psychology will inevitably gradually shift.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Varied Between North and South: Shanghai South Arrived Much, Sales Stagnant, Price Down Two to Three Jiao; Zhabei Sales Quite Smooth, Price Up More Than One Jiao; Hakka Xian Rice Purchases From Quanzhou Gang Still Prosperous</h3>
<p>In Shanghai South yesterday, the sources of various gangs still had more than 150 firms, with a total of about 30,000 shih of goods. Among them, Bo Dao rice accounted for more than 100 firms. After Bo Dao rice had been fully absorbed by the market, it was inevitably sluggish. Now that it has arrived for two consecutive days, there is an excess of supply over demand. Therefore, the appetites of gangs such as Qingyan have slackened, and only the Tianjin gang can still move it. As a result, the market situation declined. In the end, a total of more than 8,000 bags of Bo Dao rice were sold, with the price falling by half a jiao for high-quality rice, and 2 to 3 jiao for medium-quality rice, with varying degrees. A total of more than 4,000 bags of thick Geng rice were sold. Fortunately, the arrival of new goods was not excessive, and the street also made purchases, and the market fell slightly by 5 fen. Du Yang Jian and Yin Bian Yuan also showed a soft trend.</p>
<p>In Shanghai North yesterday, about 90 firms of He Xia rice from Nanpu and Suzhou River. The selling of white Geng and Bo Dao rice remained smooth, which made people feel solid. Store stomachs on this street were also active. The market price of white Geng also increased by several fen to one jiao. Early rice, such as Yangbu Du Ke Jian and Yin Bian Yuan, also sold well. In the market, the price of Yangbu Jian rose by 5 to 6 fen, Du Ke rose by about one jiao, and Yin Yuan rose steadily. However, the price of Bai Yuan remained stable.</p>
<p>Hakka Xian rice has been arriving very strongly in recent days. However, with the Guangdong Gang's stagnation, there is still no hope for a turnaround in the market. However, the Quanzhou Gang has suddenly risen to inquire about it, and has been very greedy in buying these recent days. Yesterday, they also purchased 3,000 to 4,000 bags of Hunan and Jiangxi rice. The Henan Gang still has some embellishments. Although a large number of He Xia rice was detained on the street, there are still Hakka who ask about it, so the market can still stand. Yesterday, the unified market opened with 4,450 bags of Jiangxi rice, 1,700 bags of Hunan rice, 1,000 bags of Wen Xian rice, and 167 bags of Jiaxing rice.</p>
<h3>Securities: Public Bonds Sold in Large Quantities, Price Limited, Quantity Unlimited, Big Players Short Selling, Small Investors Buying</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the public bond market in the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange continued to decline, and the downward trend was strong. A major player in the financial community, whose chips had not yet been sold out, sold them without restriction yesterday, and the market price suddenly became weak. However, the environment remained calm, and the small investors bought very enthusiastically, so the trend on the table was still considered firm. If the outflow of spot goods is huge, there may be a gradual decline, but with the market atmosphere so high, without unexpected changes, there will not be a sharp drop. Yesterday morning, the atmosphere at the opening was extremely stable, but Nos. 37 and 47, representing a major player in the financial community, sold off in large quantities. Because of limited-price trading, the decline was quite slow. Nos. 10 and 45 and small investors bought very enthusiastically, and the market price fell slightly by 1 or 2 jiao. In the second session, the market situation deteriorated sharply, and No. 47 alone continued to sell off an unlimited number of chips of types E, D, C, and B. The market price immediately fell by 2 or 3 jiao to 6 jiao, while small investors and Nos. 10 and 11 continued to absorb. In the afternoon, the trend turned firm, and No. 37 sold off a lot of type E and D, but it fell slightly by 1 or 2 jiao. The buying of type C by small investors was very strong, and Nos. 10 and 54 and others bought a lot. The market price saw a slight rebound of 1 or 2 jiao. By the time of closing, No. 43 also sold off for the financial giant, with an unlimited number of quantities per stall, and a limited price, so market prices became an integer of 1 yuan. However, small investors and Nos. 10, 16, 11, and 54 still bought a lot, so the market price fell slightly by 5 fen to 3 jiao, and the trend was extremely firm. The overall result for the day was a decline of 2.5 jiao to 8 jiao. The total volume of transactions was 13.99 million yuan. The comparison of the highs, lows, rises, and falls is listed in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Finance: Specie Premium Intended to Fall but Rose Instead - The Support of Spot Trading Firms -</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market continued to fall, but in the market, due to the support of spot trading firms taking advantage of the low price, it rose instead of falling. In the end, it rose slightly by 2 jiao, and the trend was also stable. In the early morning, the overseas silver market, the British market shrank and the American market also fell. The Montreaux forward silver price shrank by 5 li and 5.5 li respectively. The exchange rates all fell back. The London raw gold fell by half a penny. The central bank's listing announcement was flat for both Britain and America, and the customs gold unit did not move. The standard specie premium price was listed as 1152.7 yuan. The pre-market off-exchange trade opened with Qingfa Yong slightly selling, and Qiafeng Yong slightly absorbing. The morning opening was slightly higher. Although it was slightly lower after the opening, buyers took advantage of the low price to become active. The HSBC Bank listed both Britain and America as flat, and although the silver balance tax was only 1 fen less, it gradually pulled up. However, the short side increased their positions at a high price, and the upward trend was blocked, but spot trading firms made purchases, and the market was still stable at noon. Later, both supply and demand sides were active, but because the positions were very small and the trading was limited, there were only 2 jiao of fluctuations. The day's market situation will be recorded later.</p>

<p>I remember this time last year, I was embracing the desire to leave and the idea of a new pursuit, leaving the dangerous city of the snowy North, drifting to Shanghai on a wave-tossed journey; I never thought that this time this year, I would have to retreat from this muddy yet active city and seek the return to my hometown that I had not returned to for five years, my heart full of unspeakable annoyance and unspeakable attachment!</p>
<p>——Are you really determined to leave?</p>
<p>Even friends who see each other day and night do not know my true intentions and look at me with suspicious eyes. My decisions have always been in my heart, and on the surface, I am often vague. My own feelings of joy and sorrow cannot be shared or owned by everyone, so what's the point of saying them? Besides, emotions are sometimes so confused that even I can't explain them myself.</p>
<p>I use "sickness" to explain my "leaving," and my friends treat it as such. In fact, we don't cherish my life so much, not even such selfish people. It doesn't necessarily take a hero to get up and raise a gun at the enemy even after being shot on the battlefield, any true soldier can do that. I was indeed seriously injured, coughing up blood two or three times, but I still can't get up!</p>
<p>Of course, if I weren't sick, and this kind of incurable disease, why would I leave? However, my destination is not a good recuperation place either, "my father didn't leave me a penny," a mixed eater like me with nothing but a pen and a few books, how can I talk about "recuperation"? What's more, this difficult society, this unfortunate life has already created in me a mind that likes to think, a nature that is suspicious, a brain that is constantly thinking, and a mood that is disturbed and agitated by a single stimulus. It is simply impossible to ask to rest and settle down. Bi, who wrote to invite me to live in Nanyue, although we have been separated for five years, he still asked very correctly: "You who have swam in the waves, can you endure the silence of this mountain?" Remembering that after my serious illness last year, I went to live in Xishan for a month in the summer, accompanied by the shadows of trees and springs, and finally felt deeply lonely and wanted to go elsewhere. Recalling that kind of mountain-like or hermit-like life, I hesitated again in this decision to travel.</p>
<p>In fact, I am not afraid of loneliness, haven't I met great loneliness before? Only those who dare to meet loneliness are brave, and I am not so weak as to be afraid of loneliness. Only that kind of emptiness in life is too terrible, but I don't think that life in the countryside must be lonely and empty. I think that being in this noisy, do-nothing, chattering, and unproductive crowd, I feel lonely and empty! Is there anything more empty than eating a full meal or just half-full and talking idle talk and chewing the tongue from morning to night? Some people stand up and make a fuss in order to avoid loneliness; some people start a publication because they are unwilling to do anything or have nothing else to do; some people frankly say that they write amazing works in order to live a good life for themselves and their wives and children; and even more, a little bit of simple and pitiful motivation for fame is dragging his behavior; there are also foolish and ridiculous eagerness to create a "hero" who is taking the lead; I have seen too many uglinesses, I have heard too many jokes, "Truth, is often not these, these hypocrisies give me great emptiness! Others think it's lively, but I'm lonely because of it.</p>
<p>Once, the group said to me, "You have a tendency to nihilism." I smiled very innocently. I know myself better than anyone: I am a nihilist towards lying, and I am an undoubtedly realist towards truth.</p>
<p>Some friends may think that I hate reality, so I give up my task and have the idea of escaping reality. I only feel the pain of the bystander, the wounded life cannot fight against reality, so it is better to be silent for a while, heal my wounds, cultivate a new energy, and then fight. What is a person who cannot run around, has a narrow mind, and has neurasthenia doing standing on the edge of the coliseum? Watch it?</p>
<p>——You shouldn't abuse your body too much, you should "take a long-term rest," this is necessary. The nation has placed great responsibility on us, and we ourselves have accepted this heavy responsibility. In order to obtain satisfactory results, we have to struggle; but if the body, the tool of struggle, is not good, everything else cannot be discussed. I think your current responsibility is to make your body recover to health, I heard that you actually coughed up blood, what kind of look is this - you should quickly find a quiet rural place to live for a year and a half...</p>
<p>This is a letter from Jian Cao, a brother-like friend, after hearing about my situation. His kindness and thoughtfulness made me cry. He told me and my old friend Bi to go to Bi's place to recuperate. The doctor had warned me several times, but Jian's words had the power to urge me. I decided in my heart...</p>
<p>It is not very regrettable to sacrifice life on the battlefield. It is a pity to blindly waste and die on the sickbed. Let me go, leave this undead life - this cold pavilion where you are laying down will bury you, abandon this grave, throw yourself into the arms of the nurse of fresh air, let the sunlight that you don't have to pay for kill the germs that are wriggling in your chest and lungs and blood around your body. The strong young farmer is your partner and role model. Like them, strengthen your body and soul. When you return to this decisive battle trench, you will find your own position!</p>
<p>Friends! We'll see you again.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Baotou</h3>
<p>— Yingzi</p>
<p>Stepping onto the streets of Baotou city, I couldn't help but sigh softly: "This place is different from what it was a few years ago!"</p>
<p>Yes! Baotou city is indeed different from before. The hard stone-paved roads, the streets that outwardly show prosperity, and the newly built houses have completely changed the situation of a few years ago, where "uneven roads, dim lights, and unreliable telephones" were the "two wonders" of Baotou city. These were merely embellishments of this Yellow River dock, the terminus of the Ping-Sui Railway, a major city beyond the Great Wall, a water and land transportation hub. However, the dim lights and unreliable telephones were still the "two wonders" of Baotou city. The reason is that the electric company uses coal produced in the province. Using local products resulting in dim lights is somewhat understandable, but the unreliability of the telephones is truly "a bit much." It is said that once the county magistrate made a phone call but couldn't get through for a long time. He sent someone to the telephone bureau to check, and it turned out that the "operator" was playing "mahjong"!</p>
<p>A few years ago, this place was "the headquarters of flies" in summer. The number of flies was only second to some tropical regions in the world. The streets were piled with thick yellow soil, and during heavy rains, water would flood down from the houses and alleys built on the northern hillside. Thus, in summer, Baotou city was truly "impossible to navigate." Now, east-west drainage channels have been built outside the city, and rainwater will no longer flood into the city. The crushed stones rolled down from building the drainage channels have been used to pave smooth roads. A park for the entertainment of the city's residents is being built in the city center. Although it was transformed from a garbage dump and only has some flowers and plants, it is still a unique garden!</p>
<p>As dim as the unbright electric lights is the "business" that has not improved and is gradually declining. In recent years, thanks to the flights of the Eurasia Aviation Corporation and the large-scale export of fur, the "fur industry" and "grain industry" can barely make ends meet. A slightly better-equipped and more spacious "Baotou Hotel" has also been opened. The city is inhabited by all sorts of people, from Shanxi, Hebei, and various counties in Suiyuan. Their lifestyles are also very different. There are many people who come here seeking a living, as well as the rootless coolies known as "He Lu Han" (Note 1) and the "Xi Ke" (Note 2) who come to do "business." For these people, the "Pingkangli Theater," a place for entertainment, relaxation, and sexual release, is even more popular than Guihua City, the provincial capital 300 miles away. Although the "prices" are very high, it is often "sold out."</p>
<p>Sitting in a rickshaw with a friend, we passed the bumpy road, exited the east gate, and arrived at Baotou's only scenic spot, the "Zhuanlongzang." Spring water flows down from the spring eyes on the slope, flowing, flowing, constantly flowing, clear and cold. Rather than calling this a scenic spot of Baotou city, it is better to say that it is the source of life for the people of Baotou. Because the well water in the city is very saline, the people in the city all use this spring water for drinking and other purposes.</p>
<p>Climbing up the slope where the spring water flows, overlooking Baotou city on both sides, there are houses of varying heights. To the north is a semi-bald earthen mountain. The Daxiongbaodian (main hall) stands alone there. Opposite is an empty stage. Walking inside, a faint chanting sound is heard, accompanied by the clear sound of the wooden fish, perhaps giving you a sense of tranquility?</p>
<p>After talking a few words with the monks chanting sutras, I asked a high-ranking monk his dharma name. He said it was "Wuming" (Enlightened). He sent us out, and seeing his gray-green "opium addict's" face, I realized that he was "enlightened" in this way!</p>
<p>Entering the city again, what I saw was the eye-catching red-ball flags. A wireless radio station of a friendly nation was inserted into the sky, overlooking Baotou city. The planes with red-ball tails routinely showed off their power. The songs filling the streets at dusk were no longer the mournful "Climbing Mountain Tune" (Note 3) and the sorrowful "Flood of Western Baotou" (Note 4), but were full of emotion, anger, and passion: the roar of "Little ××, too domineering..."</p>
<p>Note 1: People who make a living on the Yellow River from Baotou to Ningxia and other places are commonly called "He Lu Han."</p>
<p>Note 2: Refers to merchants from Ningxia, Gansu, and Qinghai.</p>
<p>Note 3: "Climbing Mountain Tune" is a mountain song popular among people living under the Daqing Mountains.</p>
<p>Note 4: Baotou used to suffer from frequent floods, and a song called "Flood of Western Baotou" was popular.</p>
<h3>Drawing You</h3>
<p>— Libo</p>
<p>"What draws you,</p>
<p>Is it the camellias of Nanshan in October,</p>
<p>Is it the tears of a mother missing her son, moistening her wrinkled eyes?</p>
<p>Is it the distant piano music in the lonely night,</p>
<p>Is it the memory of friendship?</p>
<p>Is it the remaining fallen flowers from someone's home in the wilderness,</p>
<p>Is it the lover's sobbing after the first kiss?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Then is it the magic of ancient history,</p>
<p>The relics of heroes whose names have been lost?</p>
<p>Is it the mystery of the stars,</p>
<p>Is it the power of the sun?"</p>
<p>"No,</p>
<p>None of those."</p>
<p>"Then is it the sea?</p>
<p>Is it that surging endlessly,</p>
<p>Straight and vast,</p>
<p>The water color blending with the sky,</p>
<p>The sound of waves shaking the heavens and the earth?"</p>
<p>"Neither."</p>
<p>"Then is it the wind,</p>
<p>Is it the wings of nature,</p>
<p>Flying to the edge of the sky,</p>
<p>Flying to the desolate sea and high mountains?"</p>
<p>"Neither.</p>
<p>What draws me,</p>
<p>Is a long-vanished,</p>
<p>Hometown of 1927.</p>
<p>Ah, 1927,</p>
<p>You free calyx!</p>
<p>I ask you,</p>
<p>When will you again,</p>
<p>When these German-style shackles have</p>
<p>Already tightened as much as possible,</p>
<p>When will you again use your buds and shadows,</p>
<p>To cover the suffering and tears filling my hometown?</p>
<p>'And tyrants and slaves, like shadows of the night, are forerunners of the dawn.' Is the poet's words true?"</p>
<p>(Note 1) There is a type of German-made handcuff. Each time the hand moves, it tightens another layer. It is a very troublesome type of handcuff for prisoners.</p>
<p>(Note 1) The last sentence of Shelley's short poem "Freedom."</p>
<h3>Continued Miscellaneous Writings on Eugene O'Neill's Drama (4)</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>In modern literature, it seems not to be a mere coincidence that Catholicism and the most progressive ideas have become the dividing line between the advancement and retreat of European and American literature. In Great Britain, we see more progressive writers like George Bernard Shaw and H.G. Wells. As Andre Maurois, the French writer, said, these two "face the failures of the 19th century and seek the liberation of humanity in the future." Therefore, for Shaw, the future society is one ruled by supermen, a society of Caesars and Methuselahs, while for Wells, the future society is one ruled by scientists or experts, a society governed by "test tubes and statistics." On the other hand, we also see the Catholic believers G.K. Chesterton, who just passed away this year, and his friend Hilaire Belloc, who is still alive. These two Catholics often engaged in fierce debates with Shaw due to their stubborn ideas. Shaw jokingly called them a monster, "The Chesterbelloc." Among these two, especially Chesterton, his consistent theories can be taken as a representation of the literary and philosophical thought of British Catholics. In his two works, "Heretics" and "Orthodoxy," he opposed modern social thought. He believed that the evils of modern society were caused by machines. The liberation of humanity is to return to the past. More precisely, it is to return to the mysticism of the Middle Ages, and to have a firm belief in Christianity. Even though Christianity is sometimes illogical, you must know that the world itself is illogical. If a key only fits one lock, then Christianity is that one and only key. Therefore, Christianity is like a huge, uneven, magical rock, which, although sometimes shaken by a blow, has stood steadily for thousands of years. For this reason, he emphatically stated in his book "Orthodoxy": "The Christian Church... is a living teacher. It not only taught me yesterday, but will surely teach me tomorrow... It is a religion that tells you the truth tomorrow just as it does today." (The above quotations are all based on the English translation of Maurois's "Prophets and Poets," in the chapter on G.K. Chesterton.)</p>
<p>Maurois, believing in ordinary people and preaching as ordinary people do, is he an intellectual democrat? But his kind of ordinary preaching is the most effective defense for the past and for existing social classes. Plekhanov called Nietzsche "a great bourgeois" because the philosophical poems he wrote were the greatest achievement of bourgeois literature. Similarly, we can also call this Catholic writer Chesterton "a great apostle" because his witty preaching is the most powerful "New Gospel" in defense of Christianity. Unfortunately, this apostle was born in the 20th century, making his kind of mysticism not admired, but only ridiculed as a monster. If he knew this in death, he would probably consider it a regret. I always consider those who want to pull the era backward to be the most foolish idiots in the world. An era has its own preaching, and violating the preaching of the era, even if it grabs people's ears and forces it in, will not achieve the desired effect. Because when a new preaching emerges, an old preaching will inevitably die. Early Christian churches had a legend that when angels told the shepherds of Bethlehem of the birth of Jesus, the whole of Greece heard a deep sigh, indicating that the great Pan (whom Christians considered a representative of pagan gods) had died, and all the Olympian gods had abdicated, with many other deities exiled to the cold and darkness. Although this comes from Christian propaganda, we can also assume that the new will surely replace the old, which is undoubtedly true. Although the poet Wordsworth expressed his sorrow for the decline of paganism, he had the following lines:</p>
<p>"Great God! I'd rather be</p>
<p>A Pagan suckled in a creed outworn;</p>
<p>So might I, standing on this pleasant lea,</p>
<p>Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn;</p>
<p>Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea;</p>
<p>Or hear old Triton blow his wreathed horn."</p>
<p>However, this is only representative of personal mourning for the past. We cannot return to the Greek era, just as we cannot return to the Middle Ages. We have already heard the call of the new era, so why don't we warmly welcome and participate in the creative movement of the new era? It has been a long history. In the 1840s of the previous century, we heard the first roar of the new century. In the 1860s of the previous century, we saw the declaration of the new century's leadership. In the 19- years of this century, we saw the beginning of the new century's creation. If everyone doesn't obsess over the past like Chesterton, I believe they will surely change. In France, although we see writers like Paul Claudel, who professes to be a Catholic and persuades many French writers to convert to Catholicism, we also see Anatole France and André Gide moving towards the new era. Before the establishment of the Third Republic, Anatole France fully sympathized with the citizens' government established in Versailles at that time. Using a false name and carrying a Belgian passport, he fled to Versailles and wrote to his parents about the members of the Commune, saying: "Ruffians... they are detestable, as you can imagine. After the Third Republic was established, he returned to Paris and felt that "the life of the intellectual class in Paris was not completely lost," so he was very satisfied. In 1914, he advocated joining the war. Although he was 70 years old, he was still willing to serve in the military. However, when his old friend "Cayeux" was imprisoned by Prime Minister Clemenceau, and if Anatole France criticized too much, he was in danger of being treated the same way, he was finally dragged to the new direction. His witticism "Rather be dragged than driven away" can indicate that the progress of the times has made many people with a sense of justice follow the times and progress.</p>
<p>As for André Gide's turning away from French individualism, that is an even more touching fact. In 1925, when Gide was 55 years old, he went to explore the secrets of French Congo to fulfill his lifelong ambition. He first saw the tragic state of human society. Before he set off, he believed that he could obtain the so-called "luxurious pleasure" and "forget everything" in that area, and enjoy the azure sky and primitive forests. But when he arrived in the colony, in the "Ubangi" area, he saw fifteen colonial men and two women tied together with a rope. These people could hardly walk. Behind these people, there were two guards holding whips. This fact gave him a very deep impression. Soon after, he fully understood that the French colonial authorities were ruling black people with an iron fist. And the only duty of the colonial government was to use terror, bloodshed, and high-pressure means to enslave 1.2 million black people. The people in these villages were mobilized like during wartime to do slave labor. And to build a railway, nearly 17,000 people sacrificed their lives. Sometimes, in order to force black people to work, they did not hesitate to use corporal punishment and whipping to achieve their goals. He passed through a village where twenty-five black people had been subjected to this physical persecution. What made Gide even more unbearable was that these black people were all loyal and treated people kindly. In his own words: "Such loyalty... such kindness... and the possibility of kindness, completely gained nothing but scolding... I felt that this place was a whole suffering humanity, a miserable and oppressed race. "After several years of brewing, this incident finally transformed him. So he issued a brave call, "I must shout, shout loudly my sympathy for a country, and I must make my voice heard. This matter is very important. I must live a long life to see the success of this great effort. My whole soul desires this success, and for this, I am willing to be able to work..." (The above reference is W.Jroy: The Conversion of Andre Gide, Nation, Vol. 139, No. 3615)</p>
<p>Anatole France turning from strong Catholicism to the new era, and André Gide not being persuaded by "Claudel" but developing a profound sympathy for the oppressed human beings, are all enough to make us feel that the religious forces that anesthetize people with the propaganda toxins of imperialism will surely be spurned by a person with a sense of justice after understanding its role. At the same time, it can also be understood that the doctrines of Catholicism have been regarded by bourgeois writers as the only weapon to defend their ramparts.</p>
<p>Strangely, in many of O'Neill's works, these two opposing ideas coexist. His ideas have also undergone several changes. We know that O'Neill in his youth was a pacifist and an opponent of American "commercial civilization." In 1914, he published his manifesto (The Call), in which he appealed to the workers of the world not to participate in the war. He asked them questions, whether they were willing to "bleed and groan for Guggenheim" and "sacrifice their lives for Standard Oil." In 1917, the publication of "My Soul is a Submarine" in "The Masses" was a revulsion against big business. His poem is as follows:</p>
<p>"My ambition is a torpedo.</p>
<p>I will hide unseen,</p>
<p>Underneath the scum of life,</p>
<p>Sighting ships,</p>
<p>Stupid heavily-laden merchant ships,</p>
<p>Rust-eaten gray commercial ships,</p>
<p>Steaming along in clumsy complacency,</p>
<p>Slow and unafraid and unamazed,</p>
<p>Mocked by the great laughter of the waves</p>
<p>And spit on by the contemptuous foam.</p>
<p>I will destroy them,</p>
<p>Because the sea is beautiful."</p>
<p>In the play "The Hairy Ape," we can also see that the protagonist "Yank" seeks revenge because he was insulted by the daughter of a shipowner. He goes to join those yellow unions employed by "American" capitalists. After becoming a member, he tells the secretary of the branch that he is willing to blow up that steel trust. However, these words startled the secretary, so the secretary called a few of his assistants, grabbed him, lifted him up, and threw him out of the branch's door onto the "cobblestone street." He felt helpless, and then went to the "monkey room" of the zoo to find companions, and was finally beaten to death by the orangutan. The ultimate meaning of this play is naturally difficult to determine. But as I think, at least O'Neill has this meaning: those yellow unions are just deceiving people. And liberation from oppression cannot be achieved by individual, crazy "Don Quixote" actions. In "Marco Millions," the author also uses "Marco Polo," a celebrity of the Middle Ages with a "modern Babbitt" type, to ruthlessly satirize the bourgeois class that worships the god of greed "Mammon." The main idea of the play is that Princess "Kukachin" of the Yuan Dynasty's Mongol Khan falls in love with the courtier Marco Polo. When the princess is about to be married to Persia, she asks her father to order Marco to command the fleet sailing to Persia. However, the courtier takes this opportunity to ask the Khan to grant him the privilege of trading along the way. During the journey, "Kukachin" understands the merchant nature of the courtier and despises him very much. In other plays, O'Neill also ruthlessly exposes the sins of the rotten existing society. An American conservative critic Barrett Clark once counted O'Neill's plays like this: "Out of the thirty-five plays I have read, there are only five plays that do not have assassination, death, suicide, or madness. In other plays, I found a total of six suicides, one unsuccessful assassination attempt, ten major assassinations, nineteen deaths, and six cases of madness." All these irrational plots are not the author's personal fabrication, but have their own social basis. I ask, can those who advocate returning to the past and setting up heaven after death solve this? We do not need the preaching of death and the preachers of death. We have no time to think about the events after death. The meaning of life is far more important than death, and what we demand is to build heaven on earth. The new god may be the generator and the "First Principle" spoken by Spencer that controls the generator and everything else. This first principle has been discovered and is being applied. It will create a truly people-owned, people-operated, and people-enjoyed new system. Now that we have this key, why do we still need the Catholic Church, which only makes my pain deeper and has no hope of salvation? Naturally, readers can criticize O'Neill's "Days Without End," saying that this play has a strong Catholic tendency. The hero of "Days Without End" has been in a kind of depression for many years, which made him change from a believer to an atheist, from an atheist to a socialist, and from this into a path of indulgence, and wanted to murder his beloved wife. Finally, by kneeling under the cross, he relieved the suffering in his heart and the root of all his sins and found the foundation for his life. However, what is the meaning of this play is still a matter of debate. From the Catholic point of view, the final victory belongs to Catholicism, while from another group of people, its victory belongs to another aspect. In short, O'Neill's thinking is still in the process of development. Which direction he turns to cannot be determined at present. If he does not escape life and people like a hermit, he will surely understand how the life of the masses should be and what the historical development is heading towards, and he will surely embark on the path that all writers should take. Therefore, Lionel Trilling's saying, "The position of philosophy looks like the last: O'Neill has climbed into the dark womb of the church and pulled the whole universe in with him" (Eugene O'Neill Republic, No. 1138), may be premature!

<h3>The High Cost of Everything Is Not a Good Sign</h3>
<p>— Jian Ping</p>
<p>Sometimes, some people feel that "the high cost of everything" is a good phenomenon and are very happy. But this is limited to "sometimes" and "some people"; most people do not feel this way. Everyone thinks that in China's current situation of "national crisis," encountering "the high cost of everything" is not only not a good phenomenon but also a fatal blow.</p>
<p>If those people feel that "the high cost of everything" and the continuous rise in prices are very happy things, then, to put it mildly, they "don't understand the situation." Of course, they are also "self-righteous," thinking that the rise in prices is due to increased purchasing power and economic recovery. But we dare to tell them: this is a "dream." We should not put wings on our backs and fly into the sky to dream. If we choose to "be down-to-earth," then we should know that the world is still widely suffering from economic panic. The so-called "special depression" is still following us closely, not allowing us to surpass it. Therefore, the number of unemployed people increases day by day, and wages (even for those with jobs) decrease day by day. Most people are in a state of no security in their lives. Everyone thinks: how can the economy recover? What methods can be used to increase purchasing power? Isn't that daydreaming? We cannot help but point out the conspiracies of those with "ulterior motives."</p>
<p>We know that the current high cost of everything is by no means a "reasonable" or "natural" price increase, but rather a "man-made" conspiracy. Let's take the most basic necessities of life—food—as an example. This year is a "year of abundance," and everyone says so. But can anyone deny that this year's "good harvest is also a disaster"? On our side—the city—we see "fewer rice boats arriving at the port, and the rice market rising even more sharply," "multiple parties only focusing on hoarding, and the price of flour rising strangely," and "wheat itself having no problem, but being affected by the price of flour," as well as "cotton yarn rising sharply every day." (All seen in the economic section of this newspaper on the 8th). So, some people must think that farmers with a good harvest will be more comfortable this year, right? But what is the reality? The high prices of rice and wheat still have nothing to do with them. For them, "on one side, people are pressing for rent and debt, forcing you to sell grain quickly, and on the other side, people who buy grain are only willing to give very low prices, forcing you to sell cheaply." The losses we suffer—the price increases—still do not benefit the farmers who have worked hard for a year but instead fill the bellies of merchants who "hoard and speculate" in food. Then, can we still hope that even though the high cost of everything does us no good, it will still benefit the farmers? This is, of course, also a dream.</p>
<p>Now, we should understand that the so-called "continuous rise in prices" is nothing more than unscrupulous merchants taking the opportunity to monopolize, making this already weak and aging market even more unsightly. The end of the year is approaching, and a huge hurdle—the New Year's hurdle—is about to arrive. Of course, there will be many legitimate merchants who are dragged down by this "man-made" high cost of everything. However, are they willing to be dragged down like this? If they are unwilling, they should impose "commercial sanctions" on these unscrupulous merchants. At the same time, our authorities should severely crack down on them. We are even more clear about the current situation. The impact of the border war and the enemy's conspiracy to disrupt our rear cannot be ignored. Therefore, we should urgently seek appropriate countermeasures for the current terrible and deformed state of the high cost of everything and quickly stabilize prices.</p>
<h3>Transaction</h3>
<p>— Xu Ji</p>
<p>It was the time when the sun was setting in the west. In the small school in the alley, the chaotic sounds of reading could still be squeezed out. In the combined third and fourth grade classroom on the second floor of the reception hall, the geography textbook was being read. In the combined first and second grade classroom in the attic, everyone was reading the national language and common sense textbooks. And in the fifth and sixth grade classroom, which had been converted from the kitchen, they were reading the Chinese and history textbooks. Those dozens of little throats seemed to have exhausted all their strength, shouting something hoarsely. Like the chants of coolies carrying things, and like monks chanting sutras—this was the last lesson of the day, and everyone only hoped to drag themselves along until the bell rang, then quickly pick up their schoolbags, dragging their broken shoes, and running out of that heavy "single-arch shikumen" like crows that make noise in the sky at dusk. A burst of chaos and noise stirred the air like dirty water, causing headaches for every resident in the alley...</p>
<p>Yes, it wasn't just those ten-year-old children called "students" who were so eager for the bell to ring. Even the teachers (who, for the most part, were big children around the age of twenty—although the total number of teachers was less than five, they were all the kind of listless, tired, and downcast "youth"!) Even the "principal" himself hoped that the bell would ring soon—every day after school, everyone felt as if they had paid off a day's debt, breathed a sigh of relief, and thought, "Another day has passed!"</p>
<p>However, on this day, as the sun began to set, the principal and a few teachers became anxious. The principal had never been wealthy, and it was said that he owed six months' rent. The court had sent a summons, and recently even meals had become difficult. For example, today, everyone had known since morning that dinner was again a problem.</p>
<p>The teachers carried the appearance of old age at a young age: withered and depressed. Their faces wore hungry and disappointed expressions. Some stood at the door looking at the scenery, and some stared blankly at half a Shen Bao newspaper. Money was something they hadn't seen for more than half a year. In this world, due to the harshness of life, everything about them was immature and aborted. They were like pitiful insects in this big city, and what other path could they take besides eking out a living in these places? And the principal was very clever; he saw through everyone's suffering and saw them more clearly than they saw themselves, and he used this fatal suffering to deduct their "salaries" of ten or so yuan a month, letting them eat some plain rice.</p>
<p>But even such cleverness was useless. The principal himself had reached the end of the line. At the beginning of each semester, he printed flyers and advertisements, and had the only old handyman, who never got paid, paste them all over the streets and alleys. He also used a lot of thought to reduce tuition to three or four yuan, and offered textbooks for each subject and free admission to vacation cram schools. However, the market was really too "depressed." Even with three or four yuan, even with such "preferential treatment," there were pitifully few who were willing to learn. Relying on a hundred or so ragged, anemic, and naughty children, class after class, they struggled bitterly. His wife and children all needed to eat and dress, the rent was owed as much as possible, and donations were indispensable. Although he knew that it didn't matter if the teachers weren't paid, he was right in his assessment: they couldn't run away.</p>
<p>So he was depressed every day, "disheartened by running education." As a result, he posted an advertisement for the transfer of the school in the newspaper's advertising column: "There is now a small school with a convenient location and prosperous students..." Then, he hoped every day that someone would come to inquire, hoping to exchange the school for a few hundred yuan to spend and let himself, his wife, and his children "relax" for a few days and take a breath in this dirty life...</p>
<p>However, just at that dusk, when everyone was anxious about not being able to afford dinner, a guest finally came to patronize. Several skinny young teachers looked at the future "master" with longing and hungry eyes, wondering if their fate would be better in the future. However, he talked to the principal in a low voice, and it was impossible to hear anything from a distance. They could only see the smoothness of the transaction from the nodding of their heads.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the principal grinned, revealing a burst of laughter: "Hahahaha, you don't have to worry about that, old brother. The salaries and benefits of the teachers under my hand will not be cheap for them!"</p>
<p>Like a group of sheep waiting to be slaughtered, the two skinny young teachers trembled.</p>
<p>"That fate is still the same!"</p>
<p>The principal's laughter became even more joyful. Under the dim light of the dusk, only that rude and terrible laughter guaranteed the success of this transaction...</p>
<h3>Those Who Eat Dead Crabs Die</h3>
<p>— Jia</p>
<p>I happened to read a news item in an out-of-town newspaper: A villager, A, bought several dead crabs at a low price</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>, cooked them with noodles and ate them, and also finished a bottle of malt wine. In the middle of the night, he suddenly had severe abdominal pain and died.—This is news, also a fact, and finally, the reporter's conclusion, "It is said that it was caused by eating poisonous crabs by mistake."</p>
<p>That news item was published in the corner of the newspaper, and it was vague. To determine whether the death was caused by eating poisonous crabs by mistake (it is also a question whether there is a kind of crab called "poisonous crab"), or whether A was originally going to die, and just happened to eat a few dead crabs at that time, that is not within the scope of this article and must be verified by a great doctor.</p>
<p>However, there have been quite a few reports of people dying from eating crabs. It is also possible to see and hear at any time and anywhere about people dying from greed for the sake of satisfying their appetite. For example, even though they know "eating pufferfish is risking death," this year I saw two reports in the newspaper of gourmets dying from eating pufferfish. So, it is very common for people to harm their health by eating a few dead crabs. (For now, let's assume that they died from eating poisonous crabs by mistake.)</p>
<p>The Chinese have always been very particular about "eating" and have a good reputation for it. Eating monkey brains, a feast of three snakes, etc., can be said to have reached the peak of eating. And in the anecdotes of officials and gentlemen of past dynasties, there is no shortage of games and writings about cutting off a cook's head for a dish. Now, cities in various countries around the world have Chinese restaurants, which some people regard as "winning glory for the country." However, there seems to be no disagreement that using these facts to prove that the Chinese are particular about "eating" is obvious.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Chinese not only pay attention to the "things" they eat, but also emphasize the "season" for eating. Close your eyes and think about it. You have to eat zongzi for the Dragon Boat Festival, and mooncakes are naturally indispensable for the Mid-Autumn Festival. Other things like eating Chongyang cakes or dumplings are too numerous to mention. Now that the autumn wind has risen and the chrysanthemums are blooming around the fence, it is naturally the season for crabs again. Even in Shanghai alone, the signs for clear-water crabs are almost overwhelming in the streets and alleys. It can be seen that there are so many people who maintain the business of merchants who rely on the crab market every day. Regardless of whether they are clear-water crabs or small river crabs, everyone boils a pot of wine and invites a few friends to feast on them to suit the season.</p>
<p>"Suited to the season" can be divided into two categories: one is eating something to satisfy the appetite when the season or festival comes, and the other has a great reason—"the so-called elegance." There is no need to talk about the former. They don't have the courage to risk their lives to eat pufferfish, and they are reluctant to spend a few more dollars to eat a few crabs, only buying a few dead crabs at a low price, resulting in severe abdominal pain and death. This is the case with villager A, etc. People of elegance don't care about the taste of the crabs. They only think of "holding crabs" because "chrysanthemums bloom around the fence." So, no matter how large-scale the invitation is drafted and invitation cards are sent, dozens of people gather together and probably can't eat a few crabs, but they recite a lot of poems and songs. The reason for people of elegance to eat with the season is this.</p>
<p>However, the distinction between elegant and vulgar people is not only in the superficial differences in eating with the season. Let's take that out-of-town news as an example. We have never heard of a poet suddenly having severe abdominal pain and dying in an elegant group. Otherwise, even if you want to be elegant, you probably can't be elegant. And vulgar people like villager A ate a few dead crabs and died from eating poisonous crabs by mistake.</p>
<h3>Abandoning the Corpse</h3>
<p>— By Chen Haoxiong</p>
<h3>Frosty Night</h3>
<p>— Lin Jia</p>
<p>At midnight, I was awakened by the weight of silence. I pushed open the window. The night was thick. I hoped to hear a few distant donkey bells, a string of girls' laughter, or the excitement of a clear stream... But what flowed in from the window was the cold wind of winter night, a street lamp shrouded in a hazy mist in the wind, opening a sleepy eye in this sleeping city. On the street, pieces of sycamore leaves, carrying silver frost-like powder, swirled on the gray road.</p>
<p>The surroundings were silent. On the red small building across the window, a star of light red light was still flashing. An elderly couple lived there. The old woman's eyes were blind. In the daytime, there was often a girl with two small braids leading her downstairs. The old man wouldn't cough and knock on the door until late every night. The girl opened the door for him, and he climbed up the stairs, tapping the stairs with his cane. Soon, from the small window with the flower lattice curtain, the faint fragrance of opium smoke would emanate. Tonight, the light was still on. The old couple were probably lying on the opium couch, talking about something in detail. For a moment, the old woman said sadly:</p>
<p>"When I bought Yuping in Kaifeng, she was only seven years old. I patiently raised her for ten years, and she could do everything for me, like my own daughter. You old beast wanted to ruin her. She is seventeen, and you are fifty years old, alas..."</p>
<p>"She ran away with the student who draws books on the third floor. I can't raise her for nothing. I have to get her back and sell her to Grandma Zhu Si!"</p>
<p>Vaguely, I understood the outline of this story. The girl with two small braids, a round face, and big eyes did not want to be trampled on by the old opium addict and ran away with a young man. But in this society, which is colder and darker than this winter night, will she be allowed to escape those countless traps? May she be strong, may she be happy. I watched the red roof already covered with a thick layer of frost. I felt the night air was even more oppressive. When I closed the window and went back to bed, the lights across the street were still on, but the voices were so low that I couldn't hear them clearly.</p>

<p>Opening "Auspicious Flowers and a Full Moon"</p>
<p>The autumn sky is clear, and the chrysanthemums are yellow. A round of bright moon reflects the gauze window. The Zhou Hall has selected an auspicious day. Candles illuminate the splendid hall. The bride and groom are talented and beautiful. They are married at an auspicious time. The magnificent bridal chamber is elegantly furnished. Mandarin duck brocade quilt and a bed of joy. Embroidered couplets hang on the pink walls. High-burning candles illuminate the red makeup. Male and female guests come to congratulate. Cars come and go to pick up guests. Only to see, congratulatory banners line up on the left and right. The fragrance of clothes and the shadows of pine trees fill the room. They are happily opening the banquet with excitement. Delicious dishes and fruits fill the basins. Seafood and mountain delicacies are selected to fill the table. The atmosphere is full of joy. Three yuan and four joys add to the excitement. Five kui and eight horses drink the capital estate. Wait until that. After the wine is exhausted and the guests have left late at night. The couple enters the new room together.

<p>Yuan Chang (1120) 3:30 PM to 4:15 PM</p>
<p>Opening "Feng Xuan of Qi" (Mimi Collection Founding Issue)</p>
<p>Feng Xuan of Qi was extremely poor. He once sought an audience with Lord Mengchang. He took the initiative to carry his visiting card and visit the door. He briefly exchanged greetings and asked about his name. His disheveled clothes and embarrassed face were shameful. The guest was not good, and the guest was incompetent. Knowing your generosity and knowing your righteousness. I am willing to join the guests who eat at the thousand-stone level. Divide into upper, middle, and lower lodges. After all, Lord Dong loves the guests' hearts. When idle, lean on the sword and sigh three times. If there is no fish to eat, then leave. What's more, there is no food or clothing for the family. Lord Tianwen is generous and does not allow small things. He proudly told his neighbors about it. If you collect debts in Xue, you will naturally have to work hard, Mr. Feng. He falsely summoned and ordered the burning of the contracts. And use cattle and wine to reward the poor people. He returned empty-handed to report his life. He traded righteousness with you to spread his fame. Unexpectedly, the King of Qi took back the prime minister's seal. The elders in Xue thanked him deeply. Feng Xuan traveled to the Qin state to persuade him. They talked with their palms together, and every sentence was listened to. High carriages and four horses brought back Lord Tianwen. The Qi state respectfully hired him to the Qin state. He still served as the prime minister in the Qi court. Feng Xuan's power brought half a lifetime of wealth. It is difficult to comment on the three thousand diners. His wisdom and resourcefulness surpassed the ancients.</p>
<p>Jiang Binchu "Three Smiles"</p>
<p>New Voice (1380) 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM</p>
<p>Opening "Immortal in Wine"</p>
<p>In the past, a banished immortal descended from Western Sichuan. Venus entered his mother's dream to produce many virtuous men. His talent was boundless and different. He wrote a hundred poems after drinking a bucket of wine. Only because he could recognize the characters of the barbarian country, his reputation was known in the world. The imperial decree was summoned. He often delayed. This was because he slept in a wine shop in Chang'an city. He was reckless in front of the emperor. He called himself a wine immortal. He took off his boots and held the ink to grind ink. He composed three pieces of "Qing Ping Diao." He hired people to play the pipes and strings in the pear garden. The glass cup was bestowed with grape wine. The rabbit hair dropped on the paper and dyed the clouds. Only because of the new makeup of the flying swallows, Lady Yang mistakenly believed the crowd's slanders. He took off his hat and retired from his position. He wandered the rivers and lakes for more than ten years. A secret decree came down from above. All the government offices received money for wine. He went to Caishi Wharf to catch the moon and ride a whale. Ancient heroes are hard to match. Who doesn't know Li Qinglian.</p>

<p>Willow Shakes Heart</p>
<p>(1) Wind blows the willow. Lightly shaking, lightly shaking. How skillfully it sways gracefully. Idle, bored. Humming a song is good. My lover upstairs, please listen carefully. Don't be annoyed. All the husbands in the world have good consciences. They work hard all day and night. Carrying a thousand pounds of burden. For whom are they working so hard? The beloved is delicate. Along with the whole family, big and small. How can they not eat their fill.</p>
<p>(2) Wind blows the willow. Lightly swaying, lightly swaying. How refreshing is the warm breeze. Family matters are kept in the heart. Send out a loud song. My lover in the front building, don't make a sound. Listen carefully to what I say. Many lovers in the world don't end well. Their temperament is naturally dissolute. Their behavior is too absurd. Love doesn't last long. They casually change their minds. Causing many disasters. Alas, they die in vain.</p>
