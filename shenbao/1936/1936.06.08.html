<p>時評</p>
<h3 id="c15">法國新內閣成立以後 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>經過劇烈的競爭以後左派人民陣綫在此次法國大選舉中終於獲得最後的勝利了。右派集團的勢力、經此慘敗、衰落無可收拾。尤其是極右的法西斯主義可謂不能再在法國立足。法國絕大多數的國民為什麼會這樣日趨左傾呢。這是因為近幾年來法國經濟恐慌的發展非常深刻。農產品價格暴跌。使農民的收入激减、同時都市裏的小資產階級。不斷地遭遇了經濟恐慌浪潮的襲擊。並飽受大資本的競爭和壓迫。都苦悶不堪。以至更對現狀感覺不滿。但由於傳統的民主意識極為濃厚的緣故。法國國民向不歡迎法西斯主義。又因德國國社黨行動的刺激。更使他們對法西斯主義發生嫉恨。所以法西斯主義在法國便無法滋生。相反的左傾思想却日益成長了。</p>
<p>現在左傾的法國新內閣已經成立。但應注意的。新內閣並非包含人民陣綫中的各個政黨。共產黨沒有參加組閣。實際上乃由正統派社會黨和急進社會黨聯合組成。共產黨之所以不肯參加內閣而僅止於贊助者。因為現閣尚非他們最終的理想。他們的目的。在於　社會黨內閣為過渡。而進達於更高的階段。</p>
<p>這次內閣能否持久。當以能否解决人民的苦悶為斷。目前最困難的問題是工潮。這幾天來法國工潮的蔓延愈演愈烈。罷工範圍。業已遍及各個產業部門。連公用事業也都無可避免。而罷工人數則已超過五十萬。可見其情勢的嚴重。本月六日內閣所决定向參衆兩院提出的法案中。其中　實施每週四十小時工作制。　工會得代表工人與資方簽訂工作合同。　工人每年休假一星期。工資照給。這些能否獲得參衆兩院的通過。還不能肯定。而通過以後。資本家方面是否會一一實施。工人方面對此又能否滿足。也還是問題。此外如法郎問題。國聯問題。奧國問題。萊茵問題等等。也都是現閣棘手的問題。</p>
<p>還有法國工潮影響於歐洲整個局勢也很深刻。近日西班牙比利時等的工人運動。實際上都和法國工潮有關。同時其他國家如匈牙利等也有波及的可能。因之各方都在　　歐洲大動亂的蒞臨。特別是英國。它更在惴惴不安着。也許它和德國會更趨接近。如果這樣。歐洲未來的局勢。也許更有一番大的變動吧。</p>

<p>— 俞慶棠主編　姜愛羣</p>
<p>九江農村生活（上）　姜愛羣　九江一瞥</p>
<p>九江居於揚子江的中心，是江西省的大門，在從前本省內地的貿易，必須經過這裏出入，所以商業繁盛，輻輳咸集，不失爲本省第一個大商埠。近年來，受了農村不景氣狂潮的襲擊，百業一落千丈，店舖接踵倒閉，自民二十年到二十叫年的五年當中，計有一百四十四家之多，最近她更遭着無力挽救的厄運一則自南昌到玉山的火車業已通車，並連繫到杭州直達上海了，滬贛之間旣成立了新交通路綫，　省貿易遂突由贛北轉向贛東，九江的商業，便益發衰落，形成强弩之末。二則因爲江北一帶，是本省與湖北安徽三省交界之處，土匪旣多，水患又常降臨，一日到了有事之秋，總是互相推諉都不負責，形成所謂「三不管」地帶，而弄得土匪水患，益發乘機滋長和蔓延，後經行政院會　通過將九江所屬江北農村，全數撥歸湖北黃梅，俾便管轄，但是江北一帶，地十沃肥，出產富饒，素爲九江財政上唯一源泉，認爲禁臠之地，而今硬生生的割掉，眞是大大的致命傷哩！</p>
<p>農村狀况</p>
<p>本省受共黨蹂躪最盛的時間，祇有九江比較安全，因此一套殺人放火的勾當，始終沒有侵入農村一步，不過當這帝國主義及封建殘餘勢力雙重壓迫之下，一般農村受到摧毀時，九江農村也難免這一環攻，或者鞭韃的傷痕要益發深刻些吧！先就農民耕種的田地而言，是怎樣的貧乏化！據第三區譚家畈廿叫年的調査：一百六十四家中，小地主二〇戶，共有田地二六七·三畝（這裏畝叫做斗）每戶平均一三畝餘，這是不種田的且躱開不說，其次自耕農二一戶，共有田地一〇三·八畝，每戶平均祇有五畝餘，再决半自耕農七〇戶，共有田地叫七一·八畝，每戶平均自有及租有也祇有六畝餘，更决佃農五三戶，共有田地二〇九·八畝，每戶平均祇有三畝餘，田地缺少可見一斑。不特田地缺少，且每畝面積，也是細碎得很，在劉家壠等處，一畝田地分做幾塊，眞是普遍而不足見怪的，這種原因固然由於丘陵地的地勢使然，但一面也可想像出這是農民遺產的一再分析及地主者羣便於租佃剝削所致。遂令耕種田地的貧乏，農民離村跟着嚴重起來，第三區楊家楂房，在三年前，全村居戶共五六十家，現在大半已遷移他處，改營小本生意及勞働工人，我到那村裏考察的時候，祇見留下來的舊房子，毀敗的毀敗了，倒塌的倒塌了，充滿了一幅肅殺悲慘的氣象，使你會感覺到彷彿置身於收復的匪區一樣，這一帶的農民尙能勤懇耕種，這時都在田裏揷秧了，他們唱着：「揷了黃秧又轉靑，黃秧杪上出黃金，桑樹杪上出綢緞，畫鳥巢裏出夜鶯，讀書房裏出貴人」這首婉美悅耳的山歌，不特反映出我國古時耕讀爲本的農村社會特微，同時因爲當地！如譚家畈東城畈等地，曾出過不少貴人，不免吐露着崇拜和羨慕「做官」的心理。各處賭博的人很多，賭的名稱，叫做「天九」「單雙」和「麻將」等類，賭時的借貸有叫做「放燒」的，放冷燒每天每借洋一元，必須付利洋一角，放熱燒每天每借洋一元，必須付利洋二角，還有一種叫「鳥兒叫」，今天晚上借了錢，明天早上鳥兒一叫便要歸還—利息比率為百分之十到百分之二十。有許多農民，視賭博為生命綫，雖然他的一家老幼站在饑寒綫上啼哭的時候，也不肯丟掉。又農民崇拜木偶，這是任何省縣不易剷除的迷信，而此地農民常把木偶請到家裏來診病的，更是滑糟可笑，家裹有了病人，就由家主恭恭敬敬的請到家裏來，打鼓敲鑼，燒香磕頭，並由禱告者說：「求求大神大發慈悲，善心診好病人，必有重謝」等語。這時有所謂「馬脚」者—即木神之活代表—便接續着一陣囈語狂喊，開出一張「仙方」來，囑令病人照單配藥服用，而仙方上面寫的，都是甘草靑冬桔梗等等旣醫不好也吃不死的藥料，病者因此因循延誤，不求正當洽療方法，遂在荒謬無聊的過程中犧牲者，不知共數。</p>

<h3 id="c76">生物科講演之一　生物學對於人類的貢獻(下)  中正書局編譯所自然科學組主任薛德堉 <a href="#c76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>根據巴氏的硏究，又知道一切創傷部分的化儂，也是細菌作用，使外科手術上又開一新紀　。</p>
<p>巴氏對於微生物的硏究，直接影響於我們的日常生活，因爲知道食物和其他有機體腐敗，大　都是微生物的作用，同時又知道微生物生自微生物，我們扌能應用他的原理，把食物放在洋鐵罐中，用高溫度把潛在內部的微生物殺盡；再把洋鐵罐密封，斷絕空氣流通，使細菌無路可入，罐內的食物，就能長久貯藏不致腐敗，這就是現在市上所售的罐頭食物。我們坐在家裏所　能隨時嘗到　鮮荔子和波蘿蜜的味道，或嘗到遠隔重洋的美國牛奶和牛肉，這都是受雷汶胡克和巴斯　硏究之賜，所以微生物的發見和細胞　的確立，對於人類的是一種是偉大的貢獻。</p>
<p>生物學對於人類第二種貢獻，是進化思想的表　，使人類懷疑　切生物如何演　，如何由簡單　進化到複雜的，　這不僅在生物學上有莫大的貢獻，且其思想影響於全　科學，而指示人類　　應取　方向和解决一切複雜的社會問題。</p>
<p>古時視各種生物悉由神造，此種思想，早巳深植於人心，至中世紀以後，漸漸知道生物出於生物，神造之說，已有許多人懷疑，因此法國的叩維埃（Cuvier）想出一種「天變地易的」學說、以爲各種生物固出神所創造，但經若千年而滄桑易觀，陵谷變遷，起天變地易的大變動，棲息地面的生物，死亡殆盡，僅存化石而埋沒於地　中，於是再由神造出新的生物，故每經一次的天變地易，舊的生物死而新的生物生，在地　中所發見的化石，當然與現存的生物，逈不相同，此種思想，後因人智漸漸進步，都知道他牽强附會不能置信。</p>
<p>提出反對的證據來的，第一個是英國的地質學家來埃(Lyell)，他詳細硏究地質的構造，斷定地質上的變遷很慢，絕無天變地易的大變動使全體生物完全死減之形跡，故叩維埃的學說，根據米氏所　的事實檢討，已無成立之餘地。</p>
<p>其次發表反對學說的人，是法國動物學家拉馬克（Lamarck）氏以爲生物萬不能驟然產生，現存的生物是由從前的生物漸漸變化進步而來，而其進化的原因在器官之「用與不用」，愈用則愈發達，不用則愈退化，這愈發達的性質，可以遺傳於後代。拉氏的主張是如此，但經其他學者實騐，所得結果，並不盡然，例如截斷鼠尾，次代所生的鼠尾巴决不縮短，因此德國的魏司曼（Weismann）對於拉氏的學說加以痛　，並力說生物進化的原因，不在用與不用。繼此而起的學說，就是達爾文（Darwin）的進化論。</p>
<p>達爾文在南洋南美方面，作長期的探險採集，以收集的材料作基礎，發表自然淘汰說，提綱挈領的說：生物依幾何級數式繁殖，而食物及其他需要品僅依算術級數式增加，共應不均，乃起生存競爭，結果，適者生存不適者滅亡。原來各個生物受自親體的性質，並不固定，可淅漸變遷，這叫做變異性，因自然淘汰作川於變異性，生物遂得漸漸進化。</p>
<p>達爾文用自然淘汰說，說明進化之原因，最近因學術進步，雖不免發生動搖，但是說明進化的方法，儘管常常變動，而生物進化的事實，决不發生動搖，這是要希望大家注意的一點。</p>
<p>達爾文的進化論，在距今七十七年前，用「種之起源」一書發表，對於生物學，至少有兩種影響。</p>
<p>第一種影響，是引據種事實證明生物的進化。在達爾文以前如叩維埃·拉馬克等學者，都討論生物進化的問題，但都是架空的思想，並無事實的證明，所以不能得世人的信仰。達爾文則不然，他從形態學上，解剖學上，發生學上，化石學上提出種種事實，（請參觀拙著生物進化的事實——上海新亞書店出版），使從前架空的進化學說，一變而爲事實的證明，更使一般人均抱生物確是進化的觀念，這不能不歸功於達爾文之一點。</p>
<p>第一種影響，是閘明生物進化之原因。已往的進化論者，衹提及生物進化，沒有想到進化的原因。達爾文則進一步用「自然淘汰」說明生物進化之理論，雖現在因不問進步，漸漸發覺有僅用自然淘汰說不能完全證明生物進化之事實，但達氏閘明進化原因於　，致引起後來許多學者向這一方面鑽攻，這不能不歸功於達爾文之又一點。</p>
<p>生物進化確定以後，知道人類並非由神所創造，是由下等動物漸漸進步向上以達於今日，就是現在和將來，都循進化的途徑一步一步的向前邁進，不僅人類如此，一切生物和生物所托足的自然界，都漸漸地在那兒變化，換句話說：「日日新又日新」的思想，和進化論同樣地澎湃，很足以鼓舞我們的精神，向未來有光輝的大道邁進。</p>
<p>生物學對於人生的貢獻，當然不比上列兩端，但是「細胞說的確立」使我們知道一切生物都生自生物閘明生物進化以後，使我們知道一切生物，都由下等生物漸漸進化到高等生物對於我們的思想界確是一種最偉大的貢獻(完)</p>

<p>籌劃建築經過</p>
<p>漢水自陜入鄂、經襄鄂、經襄陽南下而至鐘祥、水流湍急、挾泚沙以俱來、稍一汜濫、則鐘·京·天·潛·川·雲·應·黃·孝·陽等十縣、皆成澤國、漢口亦受波及、在昔卽築有大堤、資為屏障、去年七月初、暴雨五晝夜、襄水陡漲三丈、鐘祥境內十八工·十一工·三四工各段、相繼崩潰、尤以三四工之潰口、長達數里為最大、被冲之處、涮為一河、與永隆河週河相通、形成漢水分流、全國經委會派員履勘、分「開河」「修復舊堤」「退建遙堤」三種設計、經該會·行營·省府·再三商酌、决定退建遙堤、十一月初在漢成立「全國經濟委員會襄堤工程處」、以林友龍為主任工程師、從事測量施工、旋以工程浩大、恐主任制不足以應付、乃呈准經委會擴大組織、以江漢工程局長、席德炯兼處長、第六區行政專員石毓靈副之、下設主任工程師曁工務·總務·管理三股、十二月正副處長就職、本年一月四日遷工程處於沙港、於是銀行·電局·醫院·商店·紛紛設立、野岸荒洲、頓成鬧市、修堤計劃、分為兩部、一為遙堤工程、一為堵口工程、遙堤起自臼口工與舊堤啣接、經沙港至羅漢寺、長十八公里零一九公尺、分為四工段六十分段、每分段長三百公尺、高度約十三公尺、頂寬七公尺、總需土方一百八十萬市方、經費原定二百二十餘萬元、因不敷、增至二百七十餘萬元、一二三段、係就潛江·天門·鐘祥·京山·漢川五縣、徵民工承攬修築、每分段至少容納工人一千五百人、第四段則自行招工包修、堵口工程、設堵口段、在熊家橋　斷流　一道、兩端輔以攔水壩、右端與四工段之羅漢寺接、謂之甲段攔水壩、左端接新集山、謂之乙段攔水壩、全長五公里、距沙港亦約五公里、沿途廣約三十餘里、壩頂高四三·五公尺、專以掩護遙堤、防禦桃汛、後又加築至四五公尺、壩上更築子埂一公尺、以防風浪、遙堤一二三叚於合龍後開工、迄堤潰時、共完成百分之九十、</p>
<p>鍾祥遙堤潰冂　箭頭所示為潰堤之一端</p>
<p>過去工程缺點</p>
<p>遙堤建築之初、卽因承攬制之不良、發生種種障礙、所謂承攬制、係飭由各縣政府令各區選送承攬、由工程處考選錄用、帶領民夫工作、承攬人無管理指揮能力、任其來去自由、作息隨意加以方價太低民夫伙食之虧墊、上下方之不符日虧月累、只得向工程處挪借、初則挪借為難、久之狡黠之承攬人復乘機濫借、到堤民夫多係貧苦農民、由政治力量逼迫而來、田地不能耕種、初次到堤、正隆冬網雪之際、每人僅給蘆蓆兩張、展轉請領、尚不可卽得、且地勢卑濕、藉草而眠、甚有未經領得、露宿數日之久者、聞頗有凍斃之事、至所定方價、初不論遠近每方四角、除提成押扣、實得三角、每人僅日得數分或一角不等、無論附近無米可購、臨時米販居奇、卽此戔戔、實不足供一飽、而風沙雨雪、不能作工、更一無所獲、惟有枵腹、在饑寒交迫下、遂不顧一切、紛紛逃亡、逃後又被地方官廳、追捉到堤、終因不耐饑寒、迫而再逃、逃而再捉、循環至十餘次、民夫痛苦不堪、官廳亦疲於奔命、民工之稍能自給者、多僱人代替、約計鐘京五縣農村、耗損不下數百萬元、於是民間之雞犬不寧、堤上之工程亦緩、省府慮其貽誤要工、特推委員范熙績駐堤監督、全國經委會亦派專員陳汝珍駐堤督察、范於二月初抵沙港、査悉此等情形、飭工程當局、力加改善、幷改用保甲制、管理工人、利用區長聯保主任保甲長之層層節制、督率民夫、努力從事、各縣縣長、一律駐堤督工、一面增加取土較遠之方價、購辦米糧、加撥蘆蓆、及對承攬人虧累之救濟、民工乃得安心作工、工程遂有進展、然寳貴時間、已虛耗不少、一二三段經范氏在堤改制之後、工程遂先完成、則四工段仍由工程處招工包築、工程旣較遲緩、取土又係沙質、　工更不堅實、潰决之禍、遂伏於此矣、關於工程得失、記者在堤晤石專員時亦就詢甚詳、石氏謂、初江漢工程局來文、請遷送承攬人、限於去年十二月五日以前、齊集臼口考選、卽經星夜趕辦、如期趕到、民夫亦多自動赴工、是時工程處規定方價過低、取土距離太遠、不能維持民夫生活、故承攬人皆不敢承攬、到堤民夫、亦無工可　、遂紛紛歸去、其後取土距離及方價扣發、稍加改善、十二月下旬、民夫　集、仍以不能維持生活、未數日復紛紛逃散、經時一月、可謂全未開工、而工程處對此種情形、始終無隻字見吿、後經査悉、乃派副司令及主管科長冒雪到堤考査、此種承攬制、似徵工而非徵工、似包工而非包工、缺點太多、乃於一月間親率各縣縣長區、長駐堤督工、仍以大雪嚴寒、蘆棚過少、民夫露宿、號呼極慘、而米價又漲、一飽為難、相率逃亡、亦誤工不少、本人對於堤工、素無經騐、此次駐堤數月、覺作堤不外兩個原則、堤是用土堆成、要時時注重土塲、土是民夫挑運、要時時注意民夫食住問題、設法維繫、惜工程處對此未加注意云云、</p>
<p>堤壩潰决原因</p>
<p>遙堤一二三三段、在各縣長督工之下、皆能迅速進行、第四工段、則施工遲鈍、該段係經過新冲河道、取十困難、本應提前開工、乃因俟攔水壩堵口斷流、遲至一月底、始行着手籌劃、二月十一日斷流後、四工段地面全部涸出、猶遲半月、方一面組織工排、一面招商承包、方價較一二三各段尤低、其取土較近者、每方五角六分、尚須扣除隊團長等費以四十六人工作、按五十三人攤分、包工之剝削、又較他段為甚、民工胥視為畏途、其中有包工聚成公司、領包一千二百公尺、自五十五分段起、至五十八分段止、訂定招工萬名、三月十八日開工、限五月八日完竣、結果所招之夫、不足三千、故該分段內、土方相差極鉅、並在九十六分段內、留有五六尺寬之流水溝、久不堵築、此次人潰决口門卽在此段、坐失時機、釀成巨變、不能使人無憾、攔水壩旣潰、水由舊河道直衝四工段、當時該處僅工人數千、材料亦不敷用、束手待潰、潰口經勘測後、長為五百三十公尺、據該段段長葉聿身談稱、二十六日淸晨、聞漢水上游暴漲、卽將全段工人一萬名、集中搶築排水主溝、並修補全段低薄堤身、以資抵禦、下午六時高度築至四十五公尺、晚九時後、水到堤脚、仍令工人在堤內取土增加高度、奈該處係舊水槽、水流洶涌、雖屢拋麻袋、加做　工、卒歸無效、十時四十分、水位達四十四公尺時、堤脚漏水、遂致潰决、損失槪數、除土方約五萬方外、計有工棚四百五十個、扁担三千六百二十五根、箢箕五千担、洋鰍五百把、工人死亡、恐亦在所不免、本人奉職無狀、咎所難辭、已向工務處、自請處分云、攔水壩共潰八口、第一號長一一○公尺、二號長一七九公尺、三號長二○一公尺、四號長一三三公尺、五號長六二公尺、六號長九四公尺、七號長一五五公尺、八號長二三八公尺、總長一千一百七十二公尺、其段長黃用誠稱、各口皆係漫溢、但未潰各段、水痕宛在、尚距堤頂一公尺餘也、</p>
<p>堵口復堤計劃</p>
<p>堤壩潰决時、范熙績席德炯二氏、正在京出席防汛會議、石毓靈陳汝珍二氏、在省與楊主席接洽增夫協助四工段問題、堤次由主任工程師林友龍負責、不足以應非常、潰後、范席二氏、卽趕回漢口、二十八日與石陳及經委會所派之技正汪胡楨諸氏先後到達沙港、當晚一度交換意見、二十九日同赴各潰口巡視、晚間又開會議、從詳商討、决放棄攔水壩、專堵四工段潰口、當由汪胡楨氏擬定計劃、其步驟為綑廂·進占·柳輥合龍、所需土方為八萬七千餘市方、重要材料、為蘆柴七萬三千餘綑、柳枝四萬五千餘担、塊石二千市方、麻袋三萬個、柳木椿一萬根、繩纜七千盤、麥草或稻草七千担、經費預算六十萬元、預定一日起十日止、為購料期間、十一日起至三十日止為堵口期間、以民夫兩萬人、不分晴雨晝夜、加緊趕築、於六月內完成堵口工作、至七月十五日、全堤竣工、材料問題、除令原有鐘祥·天門·京山·漢川·潛江五縣、再行徵伕外、並加向雲夢·孝感·應城·安陸·沔陽·當陽·宜城·七縣徵集、由縣長或秘書科長督同到堤、復由范熙績石毓靈二氏、　召集各縣縣長區長會議、勉以努力徵工、至主持機關、經委會二日有電、擬改組工程處為襄堤善後防汛委員會、請范熙績主持堵口、席德炯石毓靈副之、得便宜從事、范氏受命省府、職司監督、對於直接主持工程、於電動機已失之後、似不能不加考慮、但為十一縣市生命財賦設想、以勇于負責之范氏、或能受命於危難之際、而任其艱鉅也、査該工段土質多屬澥沙、見水卽解、此次水不至卽潰、堤土含沙太多、亦原因之一、現在自不能再蹈覆轍、如至山上取土、至少須七人可做一方、人工太多、又難容納、水勢漲落無常、將來能否如期竣工、殊未敢逆料、</p>

<p>昨晚本市各電影院、於放映影戲之前、均映上海律師公會冤獄賠償運動委員會製成之幻燈片、並將冤獄賠償運動重要意義、製成淺明字句、先行開映數分鐘、藉觀眾明晰冤獄賠償法、應行早日制定實施之重要云云、</p>

<p>中央社云、收回引水權問題、據記者向關係方面探悉、引水權在昔我國向小注意、故淪入外人之手、已達數十年、年來我國已漸注意、海軍部現已有引水傳習所之設立、以資培植人才、該所畢業生在各地服務者、已有二百餘人、海軍·交通·財政·參謀·四部、為注意引水人員一切起見、並設立引水管理委員會、凡業引水者、須向該會登記考試、所以一部份引水權、已各收回、惟淞口外銅山引水權之收回、尚待商討、銅山引水人員、昔有四十餘人、幾盡為外人、因種種原因、收回尚需時日云、</p>

<p>日籍商人、對於我國農產品素極注意、因抱﹁工業日本農業中國﹂之慾念、春季菜籽登塲在即、該邦旅華商人、已紛赴農業區購買、早菜則已上市、價開八元九角至九元二三角、貨樣已抵滬、據稱前途有十元希望云、</p>

<p>錢業營業忙</p>
<p>蠶荳亦已登塲、價三元八角至四元零、可充飼料、故各方殊重視、雜糧市塲交易頗繁、錢莊界亦以農養癰遺患借欵為期較短、危險性較小、與雜糧界往來、營業驟形忙碌云、</p>

<p>徑賽三項田賽四項此外西人兩項　女子祗賽一項十項運動今日續賽</p>
<p>參加世運田徑代表預選大會、昨日下午在申園舉行、同時舉行中西田徑對抗、以增加競爭興趣、集全國田徑之精英、與上海西僑之好手、競技一場、故昨日之情况與興緻、異常熱烈、觀衆達四五千人、吳市長亦蒞場參觀、田徑决賽、雖不能如理想之佳、合計共打破全國紀錄七項、此外四百公尺及標槍之全國紀錄、則竟被西人打破、女子表演、僅舉行百公尺一項李森以十三秒二、平等全國紀錄、田徑之外、復添十項運動測騐、參加者三人、今日下午方可測騐完畢、成績之中、以賈連仁之千五百公尺及王士林之三級跳、最爲生色、劉長春二百公尺敗於鮑文、及符保盧不終塲而去、最爲掃興、茲錄成績及情况如下、</p>
<h3 id="c163">七項新紀錄 <a href="#c163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>賈連仁千五公尺有面子　黃英傑高欄壓倒林紹洲　周長星郭潔鬱鬱不得志</p>
<p>昨日共創全國新紀錄七項、另叫百及標槍之紀錄、則爲英兵鮑文及俄人卡張擊落、其間以賈連仁之千五公尺四分十一秒一及黃英傑之高欄十五秒七壓倒林紹洲、爲名貴收穫、標槍有五十三公尺八五之周長星、及鐵餅有四十一公尺十三之郭潔、均鬱鬱不得志、王士林之三級跳亦不弱、陳寳球遠不及其本人在北平所創之紀錄、中欄跳高等亦差强人意、七項新紀錄、分誌如下、</p>
<p>鐵餅　田賽第一項結束者爲鐵餅、以郭潔在北平訓練班中成績之猛晋、必有優異紀績可期、不料屢試鬱鬱不得志、而蟄居上海之冷根培、擲出三十九公尺以外、壓倒郭潔、二人成績、雖均破冷之三十七公尺八五之全國紀錄、但與郭潔在北平新創之四一公尺十三、猶相差殊遠、叫名成績如、、</p>
<p>冷培根（中）三九·〇七</p>
<p>郭潔（中）三八·〇一</p>
<p>卡張（西）三七·四九</p>
<p>派克（西）三七·四十</p>
<p>鉛球　五人與賽、第一擲中、陳寳球即得十二公尺八八、破其本人保持之十二公尺六九全國紀錄、領導羣雄、普洛可費夫、亦以十二公尺六一追隨陳後、第三擲普得十二公尺六六、第五擲卡張奮發有爲、得十二公尺五八、派克亦以十二公尺廿二、由第五升人第四、劉福潤自第二擲得十二公尺十三後、均因越位作廢、以第五落選、陳之成績、猶遠不及訓練班時、</p>
<p>陳寳球（中）十二·八八</p>
<p>普洛可費夫（西）十二·六六</p>
<p>卡張　（西）十二·五八</p>
<p>派克　（西）十二·廿二</p>
<p>標槍　參加爭逐者十人、我國老將郝春德彭永馨、新興名將周長星均出席應戰、詎料出人意料、彭郝周三將竟一籌莫展、第一擲尼克遜卽得五十公尺以上、周得四十八公尺卅一、彭則近四十五公尺、三擲後僅存郝春德·周長星·王學武·卡張·尼克遜五人、及每擲必有進展、卡張於第五次中、始以五一公尺六五超出尼而躍登第一、超出吾國紀錄、郝於末次中亦得五十公尺卅三、周則始終無進步、得第四名、</p>
<p>卡張　（西）五一·六五</p>
<p>尼克遜（西）五一·十一</p>
<p>郝春德（中）五〇·卅三</p>
<p>周星長（中）四八·卅</p>
<p>三級　三級跳中人才薈萃、預料競爭必烈、司徒光爲遠運會中、我國獲得最寳貴之一分者、王士林在訓練班中亦具大好身手、果然昨日出馬即得十四公尺正、司徒首跳僅得十三公尺八七、張嘉夔亦不景氣、日人大久保首跳已得十三公尺三四、第三跳各無進步、祇司徒光晋至十四公尺〇三、最後一跳、王士林得十四公尺三六、破司徒光之十四公尺一九二、俄將於此時竟後來居上、以十四公尺〇六躍居第二、司徒光與張分居三四、</p>

<p>（右）鉛球第一陳寳球</p>
<p>（左）跳高第一吳必顯（國際社）</p>
<p>跳高　未下塲前、吳有接近一公尺九十之野心、劉夢九近來成績亦見進展、最後二人競爭頗烈、劉夢九跳過一公尺八一、至一公尺八二五時、劉三跳未過、吳必顯又越過一公尺八五、已破全國、直增到一公尺八七五時、因氣力不足、未能成功、</p>
<p>吳必顯（中）一·八五</p>
<p>劉夢九（中）一·八一</p>
<p>周世釗（中）一·七八五</p>
<p>普洛可費夫（西）一·七八五</p>
<p>高欄　高欄决賽之結果、出人意料之外、黃英傑竟將林紹洲壓倒得冠軍、成績十五秒七、打破全國紀錄、林僅差一胸、發脚後、林一路居先、至第七攔黃英傑從後趕上、最後一欄前之十公尺中、黃竟憑其最後之衝刺、前胸一挺之力、勝林而第一、第三倍雷、第四可平、俱爲西人、黃倒兩倒、林倒一只、</p>
<p>中欄　程金冠跳欄技術雖不精、過攔之姿勢、尤不高妙、憑其短距離之速度、竟得中欄第一、而以五十八秒三、打破全國紀錄、李世明因見中距離之少有希望、擬於中欄中一試、結果卒爲金冠所敗、白虹健將李厚達第三、廖金海第四、金冠有此速度、宜於過欄技術、稍加訓練、庶幾有望焉、</p>
<p>千五公尺　千五公尺决賽、賈連仁以四分十一秒一、打破全國紀錄、爲砟日徑賽中最生色之一項、拋落第　名谷弗爾達六十餘公尺、第三凌學文、第四克洛各夫、世運預選大參加者僅買凌二人、西人得三、發脚之後、五十公尺處賈躍居前茅、一路居先到底、姿勢步法俱佳、惜乎最後之二百公尺、衝刺尙欠速度、吾則成績當更生色也、</p>
<p>四百公尺　劉長春二白公尺爲鮑文所敗、四百公尺鮑文冉弄權威、將戴淑國壓倒、鮑之成績爲五十秒二、在國內尙屬罕見、戴爲五十二秒七、較其保持之全國最高成績五十一秒六爲遜色、到達終點、與鮑文相去達五六公尺、董叔昭第三、李延祥第四、足見鮑文之實力矣、鮑文得力之點、爲腿高步闊、西人中有此怪物、亦冷門也、</p>

<h3 id="c165">中西田徑對抗雜記 <a href="#c165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>中外對抗兼吾國出席世運田徑預選，昨在申園舉行。因北平訓練班產生不少全國和遠東的新紀錄，使上海的人們都着了迷似的，昨天到申園觀光的有四五千人之多。並有麥令軍樂隊及播昔機，興奮非常濃厚，直到節目完畢纔陸續散去。可是有幾種項目，以爲一定可有好成績出現的，反而被外國人估了優勝去了，這是美中不足的。</p>
<p>揭幕賽一百公尺，劉長春沒有下海·勝負的觀點在傳金城和程金冠·因偷跑和槍聲放不出，接連來叫决不成功的起跑，到第五次纔正式跑出·傳金城以十秒九得了第一。他的實力很足，身段也好，可是衝剌不力，姿勢亦不美麗。</p>
<p>女子百公尺是昨天唯一的女子項目，僅二人與賽，一位是黃頭毛的梅玲諾夫斯加，一位是中國選手。起初大家看不出他是誰，跑到半途，纔認出是一百十一號大名鼎鼎的李森小姐。他的勁道很不差的樣子，拋落西女二十餘碼，十三秒二平等全國紀錄。從此女子三項賽跑的最高紀錄，都由她一人統制。</p>
<p>第一項破全國紀錄的是二點三十五分的高欄，有意不想到的出了一個「冷門」。黃英傑從沒有勝過林紹洲，誰料他竟以十五秒七壓倒林紹洲（全國紀錄保持者）而創新紀錄？前面六攔，林佔優先，最後一欄猶在平衡綫上，直到終點，黃的胸部挺過了林紹洲，得了第一·看來林的功夫也在十六秒關內</p>
<p>英國軍隊裏的鮑文，大出風頭，劉長春戴淑國都給他罩蓋了。二百公？劉曾偷出一步，末一百公尺，劉的脚步很沉重的樣子。鮑文步步佔先，拋落劉甚遠，但成績二二秒七，平平而已。四百公尺鮑又大顯身手，戴淑國雖亦不差，但鮑只費五十秒二，遠不是戴所能够得到的。假如這成績給了我國選手，這就滿意了。</p>
<p>鐵餅和標槍，吾國選手都遭受意外的慘敗，彭永馨周長星原都有五十公尺以上的功夫，那知老彭二試不得手就退出。周僅得四八，三十一。還是老郝（春德）老勁不衰，以五〇，三十三得第三。第一二名都是西人。鐵餅郭潔曾有過叫三·十三尺，以爲穩得冠軍，冷不防蟄居上海的冷培根以三九·〇七壓倒郭潔，郭是三八·〇一：雖都是全國新紀錄，仍不能認爲滿意吧。</p>
<p>跳遠王士林曾有七·〇三的優異成績，昨僅以六·六四得個第三，全運冠軍葉遂安六·五七得了個第四，失望之至。張嘉夔以六·七八平庸的成績，竟獲冠軍。撑竿跳是最有興趣的比賽，亦令人大失所望。符保盧僅試一决，腹痛作罷。王禾曾有三·九二的全國　紀錄，咋與阿勃拉莫夫在三·四八的尺寸時，有很激烈的競爭，二人總算都已免强的跳過了，但决跳名次先後時，王禾還祇得了第二。</p>
<p>最滿意的要算是賈連仁的千五公尺和王士林的三級跳遠，都有更新的新紀錄出現·賈以前跑四分十三秒，昨又縮短近兩秒。王的三級跳十四·三六，也非常可貴。司徒光東山再起，猶能保持十四公尺以上的功夫，眞不容易。賈的八百公尺二分三秒六，與天津對抗時的二分〇秒三，差得很遠。</p>
<p>鉛球陳寳球得十二·八八，雖亦全國紀錄，但非他的得意之作。劉福潤在天津對抗曾有十二·九五，昨位置亦沒有，以十二·一三得了個第五。跳高吳必顯一·八五，還不差。至一·八七五時三試失敗。</p>
<p>四百公尺中欄眞是「冷門」從沒有滿意的人材產生。程余冠做投機生意，果以五八·三秒破全國紀錄。但過欄的姿勢，後脚向臀下勾，依舊不改老調；如出席世運，外人會不會笑中國沒有敎練？</p>
<p>一萬公尺山西老沒有來滬，興味索然。兩項接力劉長春也沒有出場。以這樣整齊的陣容，跑不出好成績來，失望之至。接棒太沒有訓練了。旣不能節省時間，反而要延誤時間。美國的接力隊，往往不是正式參予比賽的選手，然而他們的成績，一再在更新世界紀錄。接捧的藝術，眞太科學化。</p>
<p>昨日在正式節目之外，臨時忽來一套十項運動測騐，由周長星程孟平張齡佳三人參加。難道以吾國十項運動的成績，也一定要出席世運的嗎？以人才為標準道句話，很難解釋。</p>
<p>綜觀昨天的全部成績，大致還算不差。意外的收穫也有，意外的失敗也有；不知選拔委員用怎樣一種目光去選拔？派十二名田徑選手並不算少了。多派選手並不一定算有功德的事，多請幾個外國的敎練來指導，似乎要比較實惠些。中國並不是沒有運動的人材！</p>
<p>二百四百公尺第一鮑文（麟攝）</p>

<p>二百公尺被鮑文壓倒成績平平</p>
<p>吾國最先　席世界運動會之唯一短跑選手劉長春、因腿傷之故、在北平訓練班中、從未露臉、昨日亦僅參加二百公尺一項、不料被英兵鮑文壓倒、而鮑氏之成績爲二十二秒七、殊屬平平、劉尙落後四五碼之遠、約計時間、當在二十三秒以上、觀其最後百公尺時之脚步、頗爲沉重、腿傷謹愼、缺少練習、有以致之、撑竿跳符保盧僅試一次放棄、大爲掃興、賈連仁之八百公尺、未能　新紀錄爲憾、王士林之跳遠、亦不得志、其餘成績、平平而已、</p>
<p>跳遠　成績平平、新紀錄之期待、成爲泡影、前四名成績如下、</p>
<p>張嘉夔（中）　六·七八</p>
<p>大久保（西）　六·六七</p>
<p>王士林（中）　六·六四</p>
<p>葉遂安（中）　六·五七</p>
<p>以七·〇一公尺新創全國紀錄之王士林、於第二次得六·六四後、即無佳作、</p>
<p>八百公尺　八百公尺决賽、因有賈連仁在、大受羣衆注目、賈在北平曾造二分〇秒十分之三之成績、故頗希冀其能進入二分之關、無奈閃昨晚自濟南趕到、休養尙不足、故冠軍雖毫無問題、而成績則僅得二分三秒六、最初之三百公尺、賈之速度、極爲平平、直至三百公尺後、才加步飛　、到達終點、僅能平等紀錄、李世明與西人阿弗雷競爭甚烈、李僅以一肩得居第二、落於賈後三十餘公尺、第四趙妙根、</p>
<p>一百公尺　男子百公尺决賽、爲開塲戲參加者中西各三名、中爲傳余城程金冠趙秉衡、劉長春因欲全力對付二百公尺、故百公尺休息、西人皆庸碌之徒、放槍叫次後、才出發、傳金城即一馬當先、發脚甚快、傳後爲程、再次趙與三西人、五十公尺後、程金冠速度猛加、向前力衝、幾與傳並、共狀至險但到達終點、金冠以一胸之差居第二、傳成績十秒九、已較平日爲佳、趙秉衡第三、英人倍雷第四、</p>
<p>二百公尺　劉長春傾全力於二百公尺决賽、劉在北平、僅出席第一决測騐得二十二秒九、其後退養休息、始終未出席表演、其近來之實力如何、遂受人之極大注意、豈知昨日結果、竟爲英人鮑文所壓倒、鮑之成績二十二秒七、劉落後三米許當在二十三秒左右矣、劉之二百公尺、爲有把握之一項、在國內尙爲第一决之失敗、頗爲三千觀衆所驚訝、鮑居最內圈、劉居中、一百公尺處轉灣後、遂見鮑脫頴而出、一百五十公尺後、躍居劉前、直衝到底、第三爲西尼傾谷、第四史德鬥、鮑碩長無匹、步法闊大而速、劉自非其敵、</p>
<p>一萬公尺　一萬公尺爲昨日最少興趣之一項山西　手、祇見其名、不見其人、出席者五人、到終點完畢全程、祇得其三、第一王正林、第二日人村岡、第三張良、成績平平、三十五分十六秒六、村岡在王後一百五十公尺、張良在王三百公尺、</p>
<p>兩項接力　壓軸戲四百公尺接力及千六公尺接力、雖全爲中華隊所勝、且兩隊俱爲明星好手、但以接棒技術之欠佳、成績平平無精彩、四百公尺四十五秒八、跑者决序如下、一棒趙秉衡、二棒程金冠、三棒黃英傑、末棒傳金城、允爲程黃間之接棒、最爲脫節、千六公尺三分三十八秒六、跑者决序如下、一棒董叔昭、二棒李延祥、三棒賈連仁、末棒戴淑國、兩者俱未破紀錄、英人鮑文及劉長春皆未參加、</p>
<p>撑竿　符保盧僅試一次、因腹痛放棄、祇王禾及阿勃拉莫夫二人競爭、興趣大减、二人掙扎甚久、免强跳過三·四八公尺、並列第一、重决名次、王禾落後、</p>

<p>中華隊女子報名者共有九人、但均未出塲、祇到李森一人、西人隊參加者亦祇有梅玲諾斯加一人、故各項比賽均宣吿中止、僅由李梅二人作百公尺表演賽、二時半開賽、槍聲一響、李森拔足前奔、梅玲跟踪不及、五十公尺後、已落後二公尺、李最後努力衝刺、直達防綫、棄梅玲約三公尺許、成績十三秒二、平焦玉蓮與張潔瓊之全國新紀錄、</p>

<p>— （石敢當）</p>
<p>外侮愈凾，國難日深，某書店出版「乂語百日通」「基本乂語」等書，竟大登其廣告日：「識字的同胞趕緊學乂語，大則足以報國（？）保家，小則足以顯身掦名……」假如大家存此觀念，中國不亡，必無是理。</p>
<p>記得乂校的某先生説：一班學生與其竭力追求女性，不如埋頭苦幹，一旦成名，不必求伊們，伊們自會来求你。我以為凡事均如此，與其求人，不如使人求己，但難者就是如何能使人求己耳。</p>
<p>家裏一位老太太到廟裏去燒香，跌了一交！把手骨折斷，却還責備自己不知怎麽觸犯了菩薩，才遭這不幸。我聽了又覺可笑，又覺可憫。</p>
<p>當你對某人要做某件事的時候，須先站在對方的地位想想。譬如你不快意時；任意責罵僕役，但你把自己站在僕役地位想想，能受無故的責駡嗎？這様，你胸中的怒氣便會立刻消盡。我常用這方法来遏止一時的氣憤。</p>

<p>夏，是一個逐　漸成熟的少女，雖然没有春那麽像少女初　期的富有誘惑力，但，却像成熟了的少女，顯示着肌肉的豐滿的　綫條，而不再含有充分的稚氣了。</p>
<p>的碓，初夏，可説是近二十歲的姑娘，内在的，正孕含着一種偉大的慹與力。</p>
<p>在一春陰睛無定的　氛圍中，在鴿籠式的屋子裏，蜷伏着。偶然的，而且是突然的，在一個睛朗的初夏的太陽光　中，步到了郊外去，眞是出乎意料之外的．靑靑的草，已把醜惡的泥地，像被一般的覆蓋着了。望着似乎是完全是没有彈性的，是像柔軟的被兒那麽的一片。</p>
<p>果然，太陽光，也似乎和二個月前所見的，發着不同様的光彩了，照在身上，感到着薄薄的夾衫，已有些兒嫌厚了。</p>
<p>桃樹枝頭，還殘留着幾朶褪了色的桃花瓣　兒，但梅樹枝頭，却已結上了龍眼那麽大的梅　實了。柳枝上，也裹上了一層綠外衣，在村外的籬角裏，伸到籬外来，拂着行人的帽簷，是那麽的溫柔，是那麽的多情，是那麽地够人的留戀。</p>
<p>靜靜的小池的面上，也浮滿了大的，小的，圓形的浮萍，似乎給池面，蓋上了一重經美術家設計印成的富有圖　案意味的錦被。池岸上的靑草，似乎在和浮萍，鬥爭着誰是蒼綠得鮮　艶。但是那石級旁的幾株野蔷薇花，却顫抖着妃紅色的幾朵圓圓的花　兒，不住地對靑的野草，綠的浮萍，點着頭，似乎在笑着。雖然小池的周遭，是靜寂得僅有一個二個蜂兒，偶然嗡嗡地飛過着，偶然有一尾二尾小魚兒，在浮萍中跳躍着，發出一聲二聲低微的激水聲，衝破着靜寂的空氣，但是，在這小池的周遭，却充滿着浮萍，小草，野蔷薇等一切活的生氣，活的慹力。</p>
<p>没有成年的少女，果然是可愛，但是具有着豐美的綫條的初成熟　的娘兒，有不同的丰韻的。這便是夏的初期所特具的美麗。</p>
<h3 id="c175">綠了芭蕉 <a href="#c175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— 叔範</p>
<p>園林交夏，衆綠轉肥，生氣摩盪，着襟都淸；而芭蕉自分嫩碧，凉上窗紗，尤耐人作非非想：曉露初滋，沐髪風檐，見夫　亭亭垂立，如寒花小婢，曳綠布裳足恭承命，對之輒為大樂。日午微燠，鳯尾悄靜，薰風蕩之，凉意無數，彷佛若干稚鬟為掌靑羅扇子，又復色然自矜。迨夫夕照旣酣，紅霞薄暈，若有人兮，搖搖扶靑步障出，則又不數謝家道韞專綽約於前己。凡此吾對一叢蕉影，欣然有得者也。至若月明之夜，吟風未已，似彼幽人，俯仰感喟，則不禁為之扼腕終宵，旁皇不寐。有時細雨一簾，豆燈綠瘦，聽聲聲訴説，不異寒食嫠婦，啜泣墓下，更為濕透春衫，嗚咽而不自已。一物之微，感人如此，故余獨有所耿耿也。</p>
<p>憶童年吾父為余述　故事：「昔懹素坐　綠天庵中，家貧無紙書蕉葉萬本，乃大進。吾兒不愁紙筆，幸自愛！」時豆架掛殘月一鐮，薄雲時時被割，而流星與飛螢，更雜然亂射，目逆心奇，漫應之，弗暇記也。忽忽二十載，父已龍鍾，余雖役硯耕，顧春蚓秋蛇，無稍寸進，每作家書，迄猶臨發啟封，不知颡泚之何從也。</p>
<p>十齡就讀胡氏率　眞居，表侄女亞雪最頴美，作論對句，皆勿能及，尤愛誦千家詩，日斜散學，嘗見其坐芭蕉樹下，一卷細吟，碧雲亂瀉粉紅襟裾，幼作奇豔，凝注餐次，適表兄咳而出，面赤遁歸，三日不敢作平視。此景歴歴，宛如日昨。春杪重過舊塾，一樹芭蕉，滋長未息，聞阿亞已孀居逾年，可悲也已！</p>
<p>自幼最受吾如憐，欨寒熨暖，無啻慈母。年十一，姑怱病逝，時方盛暑，易簣，覆以蕉枼，余哀啼迄午，目茫然無覩，惟隠隠見吾姑卧綠雲中；然猶冀其起而撫余頂給餅餌也。及殮，知吾姑之終不可回已，乃頓足大啕。自是年年蕉綠，見吾姑慈容，無時不隠浮其間焉。</p>

<p>第二回　芳草麗人天微波乍托　小樓明月夜好夢初温</p>
<p>吳媽斟了一杯茶，放到桌上，笑道：大小姐一天都没有開笑容，算是這本書是喜　臨凡，你一接到就笑了。夢蘭道：我現在没有什麽可樂的，只有借了書本子解悶，書本子來了，我一天一晚就看完了，又要等下半個月。我接到了書，快活一下子，你還不以為是應該的嗎？他說着話，手就去翻動着雜誌。因先看着本期的目錄，其中有一行是爭不成雙，下面署名章唳天的姓名。情不自禁的就笑起来道：這一期，又有他一篇哀情小說了。吳媽倒是怔了一怔，望着她道：小姐，你說什麽？夢蘭抬起頭来，却把臉紅了。笑道：你不知道，我說的是書上的事。你不懂。吳媽聽説是自已不能懂的，這也無再問之必要，自下樓去了。夢蘭將桌子擦抺乾净了，說後，攤開書来看。掀開目錄後的一頁，就是本雜誌作者的相片，那作者第三幅圖相，是位二十上下的靑年，和今天在雨花台會到的靑年，正是一模一様。不免兩眼呆定了，儘管的注視了許久。太槪有十分鐘之久，自己點點頭，自言自語的道：我猜的一點不錯，果然是他。於是把書本子掩着，又凝神想了一想。這就覺得那個在雨花台的靑年，含了微笑，站在自已的書桌面前。咦！這是中了魔了。於是撑了頭，向窗子外的柳樹看着，意思是要定一定神，把這這可怕的幻想拋開。不料那柳條被風吹着，飄飄蕩蕩的，倒很是今日下午國器雨花台上，那衣襟下擺，被風吹得飄飄然一樣。這就不敢再向窗子外看，轉是對了桌上，翻起書本來了。那篇爭不成變，就登在雜誌的第一頁上，所以翻開來就看到了。那篇小說起首說：</p>
<p>一夕，為月明星燦之夕，秋雲浮昱天際，薄如羅蔱，秦一志與其腻友林映華，飲於明霞巷酒樓之一小室中。華燈燁燁，然發為媚光，映射林映華頬上。羞紅上湧，及於　角，似敷玫瑰之瓣，酒旣陳，把　足壽曰：願吾二人幽怨餘年，常能如今日晤接之樂，强笑時多，悲涕時少也。</p>
<p>夢闌看到這裏，情不自禁的，自言自語的道：這又是一篇盪氣迴腸的小說了。這位章先生，好像是與讀者有仇，必定要把讀者的眼淚一齊逼了下來，他才甘心呢。（三一）</p>

<h3 id="c177">金魚漫話 <a href="#c177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— 呉吉人</p>
<p>不作金魚稿將數月，而身却無日不與金魚相周旋，通日小魚滋生，盈千累萬，不可以數計，惟今歲天時不正，同好者頗多發現魚病相告，此則半由掉水不愼，半因陰雨使然也，</p>
<p>金魚之首尾現白塊者，治之較易，可於藥房中購硼砂水，　和魚桶熱水中，（熱水乃舀起後過一周時之稱，非眞燒過之水）。將魚撈取桶中，浸潤之餘，用手輕輕扶按魚身之白塊，自能有白腐層層而下，病輕者，一經沐浴，即可螯然，重者兩三次亦可告愈，屢試不爽。</p>
<p>欲得金魚之新奇種子，厥惟在其交配時將種子混和，似無疑義，但必先注意於成胎（前稿似已記及，即在客冬之三十　期內，以其冬　回春，魚類春性發動時也。）再得於散子時，使之混和追趕，庶能有濟，大約夾種不宜多雜，譬如「籠種」與「球魚」之混合種得「龍種球」，「望天」之與「球魚」得「望天球」。决不宜旣合球，復合以「蓝魚」或「紫魚」。冀使成為「蓝望天球」等等。祗可於今歲混合種子內，百中選一，擇其頭面眼角平正，或球形較大者，則「望天球」與「龍種球」得之矣。如欲再得蓝色或紫色之望天球與龍種球，則須於來春更如前法試之，我人但求新種，不能求其多，而少數必不難倖致矣。</p>
<p>金魚之性生活，頗有新發現，若近日中，每遇氣候濕熱之晨，與新掉淸水之後，可决其必有數缸散子。惟同一缸焉，同一日換過新水，一缸中在努力追趕，爭逐藻際，不顧一切的幹其散子生活，而另一缸中，公母兩性都木然無動。余好奇心動，撈一公魚於散子一缸中，則不移時，即加入魚陣，追求不稍息，復撈母魚如前試之，　雄見又多一目的物，逐逐奔競，威掖追趕，不稍離須臾，務使同時產卵不已。余乃更以追逐方殷之一雙，捉之置不發動之一缸，則亦木然若無事矣。於此可知金魚之散子，半基於性的發動，半實由於水分攸關也。惟過於成熱之母魚，腹大如鼓，游泳臃腫，每有未經公魚追趕，亦能自動就藻間放子，惜此楠卵珠，未必能孵化耳。</p>
<p>日前有一友人，至漕河經冠生園農場訪愚，互談フ必欲讓￢珍珠魚∟之雄性兩尾去，謂其家中所蓄之珠魚，大腹便便，迄無追趕之兆，恐難產子，有脹死憂，故非羅致兩公魚去不可，余笑應之，惟鑒於我處成熟母魚不感亦能產卵，則脹飽之說，可以釋然，不過無雄魚，則必不能有稚魚也。</p>

<p>— 王烈望</p>
<p>自一九三三年十二月美總統宣布購銀政策以來，世界銀價；完全為美國所操縱。去年四五月間美國在倫敦市場大購白銀，以致銀價劇漲，五月間曾達三三便士以上之高價。中國終于十一月四日被逼放棄銀本位而實行通貨管理制，由中中交三行無限制買賣外匯，以穩定對外價匯。及至是年十二月中旬以後，美國在倫敦市場停購白銀；中國幣制又感到極大威脅，據一般意見，以為新幣制之對外匯價；釘住於一先令二便士半之數，其與現銀準備之平價應為十七便士又七五，其計算方式如左。</p>
<p>？便士＝標準盎現銀</p>
<p>標準盎新2349348公　純銀＝一元銀幣</p>
<p>意卽在倫敦每盎新標準銀值，七·七五便士時，則一元銀價幣之實值始相當於一先令一便士半。倘倫敦銀價跌至一七·七五便士以下，則一先令二便士半之對外匯價，將不易維持。因財政部於去年十一月四日所公佈之法幣通令第四條規定；「凡銀錢行號商店及其他公私機關或個人，持有銀本位幣或其他銀幣生銀等類者，應自十一月四日起，交由發行準備管理委員會或其指定之銀行，兌換法幣。除銀本位幣按照面額兌換法幣外，其餘銀類，各依其實含純銀數量兌換。」如此則如倫敦銀價跌至一七·七五便士以下。海外白銀又將流入中國，按照實含純銀數量，兌換法幣，再以法幣三行購買先令，三行之外匯準備可頃刻而盡。竊以為此項危險，尚可設法避免。蓋中國實際上旣已停止銀本位，財政部儘可於必要時修正上次法令，而可另定行市，照價收買，務使取巧者無利可圖，則此項危險，自可避免。所可慮者，國際收支，尚處逆態，（據中國銀行二十年度報告及耿愛德氏估計之國際收支平衡表，白銀與黃金出口仍佔重要地位），此後外匯準備之維持，猶需出售白銀為交換。銀價跌落，則我須以多量之白銀換取少量之外幣。銀價跌落，則我須以多量之白銀換取少量之外幣。今日以一元銀幣可換一先令便士半者，將來或須以一元半易之，因之外匯準備，必感薄弱，如至萬不得已之時，則我亦惟有放低對外匯價以自保，而匯價之穩定，乃由此失敗。銀價跌落之危險，蓋在此而在彼。惟論者多謂今後銀價從其供求之實況而論，當盤旋於十九便士上下，不致再往下跌，究竟如何，恐未易逆利也。</p>
<p>今日白銀之惟一買主，非美莫屬。以前中國為白銀之需要者，自去年放棄銀本位後，乃一變而為白銀之供給者。但中國受一九三三年白銀協定之限制，在協定期內（至一九三八年滿期），不能在倫敦市場拋售。即無此項限制，美國停購白銀，倫敦銀市，永無起色，中國亦不願以低價拋售也。為謀存銀之出路，乃不能不與美國熟商。美國之運用購銀政策原告有操縱中國幣制之意，使中國不得不與彼聰穎　以擴大美元集團之範圍。自陳光甫氏等赴美，與美國財政當局進行幣制協定談判，當初中美雙方，諱莫如深。至最近始有種種消息傳佈。美國上議員金氏（Senatar　King）揚言中國代表至華盛頓，乃為向美購買白銀，此項消息，頗為各方所驚異。由以金氏為白銀派之代表，故為是說，以惑眾聽，亦未可知。各方亦姑亡聽之而已。在中國方感存銀之無法處置，安有再向美國購銀之理？後又傳中國不久將鼓鑄銀元，有恢復銀本位之企圖，更屬謬談。誠如中國銀行報告所云：「當此銀價之時有漲落，及其對於國內經濟之紛爭，設非多數國家認為白銀在幣制上尚有使用價值，則考慮銀本位之恢復，要屬極大錯誤。」近且盛傳政府將改鑄一元銀幣，其大小志色，僅等於原有銀元三分之一；並謂此種改鑄，實等於貶值。則財政部長已在報上發表談話，予以糾正。關於鼓鑄銀幣，素為金融界所重視之耿愛德氏，亦一再言之。彼且曾于銀樓業之請願；深表同情（註一）。至本月十一日紐約路透電傳「美國財部為完成其購銀計劃起見，尚需要白銀七三〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇盎斯。其中當有一部份向中國購買。中國雖極願以存銀售與美國，但必將有相當交換條件。以上所述為一月來關於新幣制之消息。</p>
<p>至本月十八日財政部乃正式公佈宣言計分三點：</p>
<p>（一）政府為充分維持法幣信用起見，其現金準備部份以金銀及外匯充之。內白銀準備，最低限度，應佔發行總額百分之念五·</p>
<p>（二）政府為便利商民起見，即鑛造半元一元銀，幣，以完成硬幣之各類。</p>
<p>（三）政府為增進法幣地位之鞏固起見，其現金準備，業已籌得鉅欵，將金及外匯充分增加。</p>
<p>此外尚有一點，甚可注意，即銀樓業數月來一再請求修改銀製品管理規則，已邀允准。此後銀製品用銀，仍照原有習慣辦理。</p>
<p>又據十八日華盛頓國民電，「財長毛根韜與中國財政部代表等業已成立中美幣制協定，其內容為外界久經亟待，今日已由毛根韜財長發表，謂中美兩國已成立協定，美國即將開始購買大批華銀。購遅之完旨，在於協助中國政府之新幣制政策，並履行一九三四年美國國會所通過之購銀法，該項協定足以協助國際通貨穩定之成功，以後並準備與他國採取穩定通貨之同樣行動，但各國分別談話，實較國際會議之方法為妥善云。毛氏旋發表購買華銀之欵項，謂準備以現金或美元交付，至於購買之數量則守秘密！惟將立刻進行，至價格則將以世界市場每月之平均價格為標準。」</p>
<p>歸納此次幣制之新發展，即為左列三點：</p>
<p>（一）與美國成立幣制協定，中國存銀之出路問題，已得一解決辦法。（幣制協定中有無其他條件，尚不得所知。）</p>
<p>（二）恢復現銀之使用，一為改鑄銀幣，一為銀製品仍照原有習慣辦理。</p>
<p>（三）明定白銀準備之成數佔發行總額百分之二五。</p>
<p>茲就此三點，逐一加以檢討。</p>
<p>第一，中美幣制協定，內容如何，尚未知其詳。該電所傳僅謂中國存銀，可售與美國而已。但中美幣值之聯繫。盡為當然之事。或謂美國通貨尚未達到安定之點，美總統尚有將美元再行貶值百分之十之可能權。萬一美國果行貶低幣值，則我與其他各國之匯價，亦將隨以變動。此固有可能者。但兩害相權取其輕，而利相權取其大。中國幣制所最感迫切之問題，為外匯準備之如何維持。而維持外匯準備，尚有賴於存銀之出售。如銀價跌落，於我甚為不利。而　外銀市，已為美國所操縱，故除與彼商量之外，別無他途。否則存銀前途，未可知也。美元之是否再將貶值。事在未來，而存銀出路之待決，却迫於眉睫。權衡輕重，此舉實不能謂為失策。</p>
<p>第二美國購銀政策，原為白銀派議員所推動，其起因當屬於政治方面，其後乃由政治的目的而兼有國際複準備制度之企圖，所謂擴展美元集團之國而已。夫美為甚為不利。中國原為最大之用銀國，今如並銀製品而亦禁止之，當非美國之所樂聞，此次中美貨幣協定成立，我國乃有恢復用銀之宣佈，或即為協定條件之一，亦未可知也。至於鼓鑄銀元以代表幣性質流通，對於新幣制雖無所損害，但白銀本位放棄以來，為時不過半年，今忽又有鼓鑄輕質銀元之宣布而舊有銀元尚未完全收集。內地人民，智識未開，對此恐不免為之淆感，財部亟須令各地政府，明白曉喻，俾人民有所遵循。</p>
<p>第三，自新幣制成立以後，政府雖聲明法幣準備，仍為六成現銀四成證券，但實際上銀準備之價值；已照外匯計算，而外匯與黃金亦加入準備，（實際所需要之準備，亦祇有外匯而已，）今乃明定現銀準備應佔發行總額百分之二五。本來中國有完全採用外匯準備之可能。而今則已成確切無疑之複準備制，此為新幣制史上最可注意之一點。美國自購銀政策宣佈後，卽憶規定金四銀一之複準備制，其野心所在，蓋欲推行於各國，該電所謂：「以後並準備與他國採取穩定通貨之同樣行支，但各國分別談話，實較國際會議之方法為妥善云，」此次中美幣制協定成立，蓋為美國增加一種極好之經騐。故二十一日字林西報路透電傳，白銀派領袖畢德門氏聲言：「此次協定為拉丁美洲諸國所應跟隨之實例，而美國在倫敦經濟會議，所提各國中央銀行之現金準備，應維持百分之二十之白銀一案，卽為此次協定之根據。」又據大美晚報十九日華盛頓國民電：「今日美國決定開始著手第二步之世界貨幣穩定工作計劃，以謀恢復國際貿易及求取世界和平。該項工作計劃乃在與中國訂立購買白銀協定後所決定者，此間人士深信美國即將與列強分別開始談判，各國拖欠美國之戰債問題以謀此困難問題之解決，政府官員今日以為通貨穩定及國際貿易現狀之對戰債問題的解決，有深切關係一點，表示有此同感云。」美國企圖國際通貨之領導權：挾其兩種武器——戰債與白銀政策，與東西各國相週旋，今白銀政策，已告成功，乃欲進而以戰債問題與各國分別談判，以遂行其國際複本位之企圖。惟各國猜忌之見猶深，國家之主義氣燄尚高。國際貿易之種種限制，如關稅壁壘，定額分配制，封鎖帳項，匯兌限制，等依照存在，如僅謀國際通貨之穩定，能否如美國之所願望，殊屬疑問。在另一方面，複本位制，久為各國所唾棄，歐洲各國對於國際通貨之穩定，主張由國際共同協定，設立國際清算銀行，節約現金之用途，仍以黃金價值之標準，此為一般經濟學者之意見。是與美國之主張，未必能相協調，況美國之企圖，顯有自利之嫌，而白銀派之政治作用，又極深厚。歐洲各國是否肯遷就美國之主張，亦屬疑問。美國雖可以戰債為要挾，但各國遷延抵賴，亦無如彼何。然就反面而論，欲謀國際通貨之穩定，自非擁有金實力如美國者出而首創不可。否則國際僵局，永無打開之望。惟領導者須有犧牲精神，若成見太深，惟利是圖，欲以勢力挾制各國，必使就簡於我，亦終見其徒勞而已。</p>
<p>就複本位制而論，則國際共同採用；在理論上原為各國經濟學家所共認。問題乃在原來用金諸國；是否有此需要。在彼以為祇須美國放出封固中之黃金，國際通貨問題，即可解決，（此一問題甚為複雜，此處不能詳論。）無採用國際複本位之必要。故此二種意見能否接近，正未可知也。中國情形，與用金諸國不同，中國原係用銀，　　準備大部份原為現銀；所感需要者為如何獲得外匯準備之接濟。此次與美訂立貨幣協定，在我正合我之所需；在彼則為遂行其國際複本位制之試金石，協定之成立，固非偶然也。但美國以為中美貨幣協定之成功，便可作為與其他各國分別談判之先例；恐未免過於樂觀。在我則固希望其成功也。（社會經濟月報第三卷第二期姚慶三氏，「銀價跌落聲中新貨幣政策之前途及複準備制度之建議」一文，可資參考。）</p>
<p>最後，此次中美幣貨協定之成立，事先英國未曾表示若何意見，事後則頗表稱頌。夫中國新幣制之成立，得英之助為多，今中國與美國訂立貨幣協定，豈為英國所甘願？此點當為一般人所欲探究。愚見以為英國對於中國幣制，不必與美爭，亦不能與美爭，蓋英鎊與美元，今已穩定於戰前之平價，茍雙方貨幣政策，中幣與美元穩定，與英鎊亦漸無不穩定之理。英乃坐享其成，亦何樂而不同情於美？此英之所以不必與美爭。美國有操縱世界銀價之力，中國存銀出路，勢非美幫忙不可。英實無能為計，上次倫敦銀行界於美國在倫敦停購白銀之時，欲圖聯合購買，終於曇花一現，未有結果。此英之所以不能與美爭。至於英美事先有無諒解，非所知也。</p>

<h3 id="c184">論鑄造銀幣 <a href="#c184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— 予敻</p>
<p>財政部近發表宣言，申述政府保持幣值的安定與確定其獨立的自主性的初衷，足徵政府謀國內經濟安定的志念，始終以鞏固法幣自身的信用為基礎，決不依違於國際之間，而為他人的附庸，此種「自力是賴」的政策，當為國人所其鑒。至其所宣示的辦法三點，第一與第三均在謀準備的充實，確定信用的基礎，此固為政府一貫的政策，亦為鞏固法幣信用的根本方未能，自無可論之處。其第二點則為新銀幣的重鑄，此則殊非一般意想所及，倔今有加以注意必要。原文稱：「政府為便利商民起見，即鑄造半元及一元銀幣以完成硬幣種類。」在進行集中銀貨及嚴禁硬幣流通時候，忽然宣言重鑄銀幣，自難免引起多方面的誤會。吾人就目前國內的情形觀容，增鑄銀幣，似無必要。蓋自去年十一月四日禁止銀幣流通後，主輔法幣流通無阻，雖在平昔認為習用硬貨的頑固窮材，亦推行順利，從無困難，此足證人民對於新的環境，均能隨時適應。交易旣未發生阻滯，鑄造銀幣以謀交易便利，自無必要。故吾人推則個中命意，或不無國際上的苦衷。然成事不說，吾人所應注意者為今後的問題，和問題所在，因勢利導，庶可隨時除幣而就利，謹陳數點如次。</p>
<p>第一，政府旣實行造幣，勢必發出流通，否則造幣成本，將成無益的浪費。財部所決定鑄造者旣為一元及半元銀幣，則不能視為輔幣可知。此種銀幣，政府必規定法價於法幣回價流通，兩者法價。如何始終保持其劃一流通，胥為值得考慮的問題。吾人之見，政府新鑄銀幣，必也為一種命名的代表幣，其實值必在面值之下，然其本身究有相當成分的實值存在。就人民的一般心理，不免有發生偏差之虞。此在一般內地區域，尤隨時有發生此類現象可能，故如何地兩者價格始終保持一致，似為應行考慮的問題。吾人之意，政府旣已再事鼓鑄銀幣，則銀幣與法幣數額應各有相當限制，使兩者之間，不致因數量少而價高，不致因數量多而價賤。而在新幣未鑄有相當數額以前，暫可不必發出流通，使不致有投機居奇之事出現。</p>
<p>第二，目前政府正在集中銀貨。現在市場上法幣與銀幣購買力完全相等，人民心目中因無比較餘地，只知紙幣與銀幣在交易上代表同一意義，故集中進行，困難較少。倘此時發出新鑄銀貨代表幣流通市面，則新銀幣與故銀幣目中固遺一貨幣減值的印象，且彼等將變過去心理，將舊銀幣緊藏，在集中現貨上不啻以多一層阻力。此殆為事實所不能免。是以吾人主張政府目前雖開始鼓鑄銀幣，但可不必急急於發出流通，而在短時間以內，加緊舊銀幣的集中，庶免發生市場上的紊亂與自壤其集中現貨的政策。蓋強不同值的銀幣使有相等的市價，則舊貧緊藏，勢無可免，政府集中現貨的政策，恐將因此而自行破壞。</p>
<p>第三，現在法幣的對外匯價，維持安定，此為吾人應該始終保持的政策。法幣不能兌現而可以法價購買外匯，此即所謂外匯本位，新鑄的代表銀幣，雖亦可以同樣法價購買外匯，然其本身具相當成分的實值，且內人民用現的習慣尚未盡改。恐新銀幣發出之後，將有一種自然趨勢逐漸流入內地農村，反之法幣則多集中於隨時可以直接易成外匯的都市。如是農村貨幣與都市貨幣將於無形中逐漸發生分化作用，銀幣在農村流通，法幣在都市流通，恐久而久之，法幣在內地的流通反受銀幣的侵害。按之我國的實際環境，此蓋大有可能。如何防止此種流通區域的自然分化，倔今為值得考慮的問題之一。</p>
<p>第四，目前國際風雲不定，我國所處的地位尤易受國際環境的影響。根據各國的經騐，在國際關係發生變化時，硬幣流通，最易感受影響。例如南北戰爭時代美國的銀輔幣，其面值與實值雖相差甚遠，然轉瞬之間亦全被藏匿。再如歐戰時的行署法國，初時為調劑市面計，曾由中央銀行發出巨量銀幣，面值與實值差數亦大，然不久亦全被暗藏，絕跡市面。我國新鑄銀幣，縱其面值不取於其實值，然在國際事變發生之後，恐亦將被藏匿絕跡，初時則足以使市面殭結，交易阻滯，久之則難免發生暗盤交易，擾亂市場，妨害法幣流通。此蓋明如指掌，可以預見者。如何使此種現象不致發生，似也應於此時再三考慮也。</p>
<p>第五，新銀幣的成色重量如何，目前尚不得而知，然事實上恐不至太低，太低則不無發生人民心理上的影響。在現貨——舊銀幣未完全集中的情形之下，新銀幣定價太低，尤足以影響人民對於新幣制的信心，蓋暗中尚有一部分舊銀幣可以比較。倘新銀幣定價事實上不至甚低，則法幣的對外價值，顯已受此限制，而之退縮彈性。則為不能否認的事實。在鑄幣之初，此點也不能不加以考慮。</p>
<p>上面五點，為吾人對於鑄造新銀幣的意見。就事實論之，吾人深認鑄造銀幣，無此必要。蓋自法幣政策施行後，外匯安定，法幣流通無阻，一掃幾年來銀本位的迷霧，今後對外方面，但能維持匯率安定，對內方面，能逐漸改善金融機構，以適合此嶄新的制度，則國內經濟的否極泰來，當可假時以待，鑄造銀幣，似覺非目前必要。然吾人能隨機應變，隨時避免產生將來的惡影響。抑猶有言者，自政府宣布重鑄銀幣後，一般談論，頗誤會以此與近平銀價的低落有關。甚有謂政府因不能脫售銀仙，故轉以鑄造銀幣，此則更近無稽之論。蓋我國幣值，已純粹不受銀價的支配。銀價高低，於我國幣值絕無關係。就我國目前視之，銀價漲跌顧全與絲價或桐油價的漲跌同其意義。銀價高固可使我國於出售銀貨時多得利益，銀價低吾人固不免感受損失，然也只限於出售銀幣時所得的代價較少而已，與幣制組織固絕無關係。且就目前所可出售的銀子觀之，卽使銀價跌一半，我國所損失者，恐猶不若東北喪失後大荳出口自我國國際貿易中減去所損失者之鉅。吾人又何必斤斤以此而自危。改鑄銀幣，原因決在此。吾人只能其認為政府應付國際環境的一種權宜政策而已。</p>

<h3 id="c190">華北日增兵所引起之謠言 <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 敬</p>
<p>平津近日因某方增兵，謠言突起，人心惶惶，大有不可終日之勢，惟謠言爲何，報上鮮有載述，無從得知，昨據北方當局宣稱，目前應付時局步驟，對內，决精神團結，努力地方建設，對外，决以和平爲主旨，本平等互惠，互尊主權之原則，進行一切云云，惟近日華北非常之局面，與不安之狀態，均爲某方隻手所造成，謠言之來，應由某方負其責任，某當局委曲求全，聲明政策，原是一片苦心，實出於萬不得已。</p>
<p>蓋愛好和平，本爲我國人之特性，而「多」事不如少一事，亦成我國之格言，但互惠互尊，必須以事實爲根據，今某方日日增兵，到處走私，而仍以和平親善爲藉口，直與玩弄嬰孩無異，試聞怎樣情形而方得謂之不和平不親善乎？和平親善果如是乎？入方以和平親善之名欺我，我猶以和平親善之名自欺，人之欺我，猶可說也，我而自欺，未免不智甚矣。</p>

<p>不但如此，現在又新發生所謂北寗路炸彈案爲何方所造成，與爲何人所行使，現尙在偵査中，雖無從得知，惟據一日哈瓦斯電，據英國自由黨新聞記事報，對於此事，曾加以批評，謂「北寗路發生炸彈案，竟與一九三一年瀋陽附近路軌被炸一事，如出一轍，前此炸案結果，而傀儡國遂以造成，此次炸案，亦適發生於華北某方增兵計劃完成之日」，云云，如果如此，則某方不但不肯消滅謠言，而且日日在製造謠言矣，試問謠言如何能息。</p>

<p>當她帶着婦人的氣息似地指揮着工人們的時候，却好像一但兇惡的樣子似地叱喝道：</p>
<p>「什麽！總共多少碟，多少錢咧。」</p>
<p>那種聲音簡直是尖呌了！</p>
<p>我們起初覺得她的聲音很討厭，不過，一天一天地的觀察下去，我們就感到被衝傷了自己的心靈似的難過起來了。是呵，不錯，你看看她整天地，像一個囚徒似的被父母監視着，坐在賬櫃裏，瞪着沉悶而失了天眞之羣的一切，那路上的汽車，滾起了的囂張　塵垢，毫無惋惜地，撲着那還是小孩子的臉兒呢</p>
<p>「爲什麽你沒有笑呢？」我們撩她了。</p>
<p>「別扭着人呵！誰像你一樣要笑呢」？</p>
<p>她抿着小嘴兒，又好像迸出了憤怒的火燄來似地尖呌着了。她的臉所有的是怒火，天眞的氣息早就被鬼噬呑去了呵！也許，她被這種生活把活潑的心挫折了。</p>
<p>「然而，你不是應該有笑的嗎？你姆媽還要笑哪，你在，她沒有你一樣的狠呢！」</p>
<p>她差不多要　出眼淚來了，眼圈兒紅起來啦。</p>
<p>「小姑娘，假如你不在春天裏多笑一笑，那麽，你就永遠地沉寂了你要求，快樂的心靈了！」</p>
<p>這句話刺激着宇宙上一切沒有快樂的人們底心靈呵。</p>
<p>她突然地，像反抗似的拍着檯子：</p>
<p>「滾開吧，你們偏要撩我！酒思頭！」</p>
<p>像傷心的婦人一樣淌下淚來了，疲乏地，再沒有憤怒了。</p>
<p>這樣，我們以後都只沉默着，望着她的創傷了的臉兒，太息着了。</p>
<h3 id="c192">初夏 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 楞嚴</p>
<p>「初夏是一個沒有悲哀的季節」。</p>
<p>不知那一位先生的話。上海的文學靑年們，往往高興寫一點秋天和春天的文章，這原因我懂得：靑年們的感情豐富，而春天和秋天，又是惹人感慨的季節。傷春和悲秋，不是佔了中國文學的大部嗎？</p>
<p>至於我，那末，最高興的，到是初夏，春天繁花如錦，實在美麗得很，不過，就因爲處處繁花，嫣紅姹紫，使我不自一的起了「繁瑣」的感覺，更說得絕端一點，就是不免有點「俗氣」，譬如妙齡女郞，雖則嬌艷非常，而「儀態」之間，終不能脫盡小氣。</p>
<p>秋天吸，古人早已有素妝嫠婦的譬喩。淸疎淡遠，非不楚楚動人，但是顧盼之間，總令人抑鬱寡歡。惟有初夏，開到荼　花事了」，綠樹陰濃，十分酣暢，好像靑年少婦，脂粉初拋，覆額之髮，盡行掠起，鮮明朗潤，使人心曠，然而這種好處，决非少男少女所能解，就是我自己，眞正了解初夏的好處，也是一二年來的事。</p>
<p>離開鄕村已經三四年了，回想這時候，綠秧遍地，陰陰夏木，從近處直到天邊，响午的農村，正靜得什麼聲音也沒有，假使你一個人携了一卷書，在溪邊　讀。讓水面和風，流蕩你的頭髮，你一定感到說不出的喜悅。這時你不必把自已沉向幻想的海中，目前的景色，實在太使你舒適和滿足。</p>
<p>是的，初夏正是困人天氣，假使你看看書而眞的覺到困倦時，那你就不妨倚樹假寐。橫豎有淸朗而嚮亮的佈榖聲，來摧醒你，牠不但摧你醒來，同時，更用牠的啼聲使你神淸氣爽。因爲牠的啼聲旣不像黃鶯的瑣息，也不像杜鵑的哀怨，牠的啼聲，是同樣的具着初夏的明朗性。</p>
<p>牠往往從遠處飛來，啼聲從天邊直嚮到雲際：牠又漫漫向遠處，啼聲從雲際再嚮到天邊。漸漸地聽不見了，於是宇宙又回復到方才的寗靜。</p>
<p>傍晚了，初夏的農村，就更加平和，炊烟輕淡到看不見，處處水車，快樂的唱着，水珠飛玉般的濺開，於是壯健的　年們，唱歌了，他們唱出生活的艱辛，他們唱出愛情的熱烈，但當他們爲了目前的景色所陶醉時，也就隨口的讚美着秧針和啼烏了。</p>
<p>美麗的景色，常常會使人們忘了工作，但是初夏幷不使人沉溺，他只是充滿了生命的酣暢，只就這點說來初夏的値得稱頌，已經確定的了。</p>
<p>初夏在農村中已如上述，其實初夏在院落，更加美妙，「芭蕉分綠上窗紗」，重簾垂地，茶息棋閑，倦倚北窗，神與古會。「紙屛不枕竹方床手，倦拋書午夢長」，古人有多少閒適的詩文在這時候做出。至於「都市」，那末季節的表現，只在婦女們的衣飾上，因爲初夏的不寒輕暖，或則也更加活躍點罷，我是不能確實知道的。</p>
<p>「初夏是一個沒有悲哀的季節」。</p>

<h3 id="c194">陰雨 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— 耳禾</p>
<p>趙二伯抬頭起來的時候，雨已經細了一些了。他從檯橫槓上將旱烟管抽了起來。在一個烏黑的烟包裏他用兩隻長手指挾起了一撮烟，隨卽放在左手掌上團成了一團裝到烟管頭上去。他遲慢地打着火，接着兩道濃烟紋從他的鼻道裏噴出來。</p>
<p>他再抬頭起來的時候，雨更細了。他的緊緊地皺着的眉頭像雨後的芭蕉漸漸地舒展起來。</p>
<p>「大槪不會再下了吧？」那麽自語着，他微笑起來了。他的眼前閃耀着一片黃的浪花，他看見了一顆顆的大的麥穗。</p>
<p>不知不覺地他抽烟的力量加大了，從鼻道裏噴出來的烟紋也更濃了。「嘶，嘶，」在他的烟管頭上有着有節奏的微細的聲音，烟管頭恰巧在擡底吓，因此，薄薄的陰暗中烟管頭上的火光跟着，「嘶，嘶，」的聲音在一揚一抑。他期待着，等雨停了，他便要上田塍去望望。</p>
<p>然而老天彷彿故意戲弄他似的，雨又漸漸地大起來了，這使他焦急，剛纔的喜悅早被雨聲滴得破滅了。他痛恨這滴不盡的雨，已滴了這許多天數了，難道還不會停止嗎？他知道，現在這幾天是麥的豐收與吾的緊要關頭。麥桿長得很好，看樣子定然會豐收的·然而麥穗究竟剛剛透起來，沒有適當的陽光，常淋在陰雨裏，定然只會長麥桿，而麥穗不會結實的。麥穗不結實，收成當然减少了。並且照現在的情形看，道减少將是大量的减少。他將右手在頭頂上搔了幾下，他無可奈何地嘆着氣：</p>
<p>「反了，反了，這年頭一年不似一年了！」</p>
<p>他又裝上了一管烟。一管烟，他是有些吝嗇的，不過他的心實在太苦，不借烟燒燒他簡直無法安排他自己。同時看着剛敲下來的亮的烟灰，他彷彿覺得一管烟在節省一根火柴上可以得到塡補似的。他毫不躊躇地抽起第二管烟來了</p>
<p>抽着，抽着，雨還是時大時小時斷時績地下個不停。</p>
<p>去年的麥全給冰塊打去，今年的麥行將得手了，不料一連七八天的陰雨。他想起難於生活的一家老小，他的眉頭皺得更緊了。他已生活了五十幾個年頭，從沒有見過這幾年來的收成，不是早災，便是水災，不是水災，便是蟲災。一堆可怕的黑暗凝凍在他的眼前。他敲去了第二管的烟灰，立起身來望望天，天暗沉沉地，只是雨細了一些了。</p>
<p>他冒着細雨向田塍上走去，脚下頗濘滑，常有跌下去的危險，他的脚老是站不穩，他悲傷他的衰老，他想起他的盛年，他禁不住自言自語道：「太陽橫豎下山了，太陽橫豎下山了！」（註）然而生之力鼓勵着他，無論如何他要生活下去的，他小心地平安地到了自己的麥田旁，他撫摩着麥桿彷彿撫摩着一個心愛而又不幸的孩子。</p>
<p>麥桿長得很高，他知道這不是一個好現象，他知道今年的麥穗一定不結實了，一定要打很大的折扣。於是他的眉頭緊緊地皺起來了。</p>
<p>雖然是細雨，但慢慢兒慢慢兒將他的破外衣滲濕了。他望望西天，他的維一的希望，就是從此刻起不要再下雨。他孤獨地，悽凉地在泥濘的路上一步一滑地走回家去。</p>
<p>晚上，他裝了一管烟，熄去了煤油燈，將要躺進被去的時候，他聽見打在茅屋上的雨聲很響了。他的眉頭父緊緊地皺起來，又是一堆可怕的黑暗凝凍在他的眼前。「嘶，嘶，」他用力地抽了幾口將烟灰敲去了，接着毫不吝嗇地又抽第二管，他知道，他今晚一定睡不着了。</p>

<h3 id="c195">大地的歌 <a href="#c195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— 朱露</p>
<p>大地是廣闊的</p>
<p>一陣灰沙飛揚過去，大地模糊地開展起來，無垠的大地，向四週發展着，</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>滿地深黃色的泥土，和着大海一樣地遼闊，土地直伸長到矇朧裏去，像接連着灰色的天涯。</p>
<p>在蔚藍的天幕下，大地廣大滾滾地展開，陽光溫存地撫着黃泥，在泥土上，一條灣曲蛇一樣的小路裏，積壘留下着一個個奔跋的足跡。</p>
<p>大地追憶起往昔的時候來。</p>
<p>在大地裏，曾經埋腐了許多祖先的頭顱，在泥土裏，曾經滲進了好多年代奴隸的血汗，在裏面藏着一年接連着一年的辛苦，費了許多農奴的心血，一代代的人們，都埋沒在裏面，正像一隻隻撲着翅膀的飛蛾，投到火燄裏一樣。</p>
<p>在大地裏，葬埋過一代代農民們的辛酸，一個個農民，辛苦地從小勞作到老，身上的血汗，一天天滿滿地流掛下來，像一顆顆珍珠般，灌肥着泥土，把荒蕪了的土地，耕耘得成熱起來，農民們的身子瘦癟下來，大地却茲生着耕種的菓子，農民們顫抖地鏟動着泥，從晨曦直到夜上，從明媚的春天直到冷酷的泳凍天，血流盡了，精力費掉了，直到苦痛地到什在地上。</p>
<p>大地裏，古英雄也曾騎着馬飛馳，鐵的馬蹄踐踏着泥土騁馳過去，在飄揚的大旗下，雙方陌生的戰士，瘋在戰鬥殘殺起來，紫紅的血流在低窪的地方，流積成河，無盡的骷髏露在地上，土地荒蕪了，直到沒有被殺戮，跳出去的農奴重回來，耕種着土地，忍受着一代代同樣的命運。</p>
<p>在大地裏，也曾灌着悲痛的慈母和婦人們的眼淚，在熱淚裏含着沉痛的想思，她們一個個惦記着，沒有音息的孩子和丈夫，她們失去了最親暱的人，在空虛的懷裏凛着撕裂心靈一樣的苦痛，天天熱淚滴下來，灌生了野花，在每一個墳墓上，斑斑血漬似的小野花。</p>
<p>大地遼闊得，沒有盡頭一樣。</p>
<p>大地就像一隻廣大沒有邊般的大搖籃，一個個人從裏面生長，一個個又在籃裏死亡，大地又像一個老祖母，一個個孩子在它懐裏長大，又一個個投到它的手腕裏，葬埋了殘骸，每一個人到盡頭，——一個個重歸入故土！</p>
<p>大地沉默着，當一陣狂風吹過來，整個大地咆吼了。</p>
<p>有一個時期，土地衰老了。</p>
<p>當秋天的時光裏——</p>
<p>在稀簿的夕陽裏，一個個頭上包着藍花布巾的農女，活潑地跳躍在大地上，她們一個個迎着風，手臂不停地撤着，從手掌裏飄出了粒粒散開的種仔，她們的面孔上，滿溢着靑春的光芒。</p>
<p>她們播散着種仔，寬大的衣袖，滿孕着風，一個個健實的胸肺，撲進狂風裏，頭巾飄動，一個個大地的女兒，不停地伸着健美的手膀。</p>
<p>荒蕪了的大地，接受地懐孕了。</p>
<p>天色慢慢矇朧下來。</p>
<p>遙遠浸在陰暗裏的一個流浪漢，發呆地望着大地裏活躍着的農家女，他深深地感動了，他寂寞的懐裏，被着一種汹湧的精力充實起來。</p>
<p>他痴痴睜大着眼睛望着。</p>
<p>他激動地伏在地上，</p>
<p>在黑暗裏，他的嘴覆下來，緊緊靠貼着深黃色的泥土……</p>
<p>虔誠地吻着大地。</p>

<p>— 顧文宗作</p>
<p>麗雅　得了，你別拿我開玩笑了，我心裏够難受的了！</p>
<p>驚鴻　得了，我的大小姐，你別雖受了，花錢上當，祇是一回，難受又有甚麽好處呢？氣壊你那玉體，那倒不是鬧着玩兒的。</p>
<p>麗雅　我眞恨那些商人的欺騙手段，他們不惜任何犧牲，到處做那些欺騙性的廣吿，你瞧瞧，沿鐵路所經過的地方，那兒不是廣吿，公共場所的廣吿，更做得比僻靜地方觸目，允其是上海地方，沒有一條沒有廣告的馬路，那些高樓大厦的屋頂，也都因爲有利可圖的緣故，供給商人做了廣吿的市場，這簡直是廣吿世界哩！</p>
<p>驚鴻　廣吿越多，越顯着市而不景氣，要　　市面的繁榮，當然要利用廣吿宣傳的力量；向外推廣發展，我剛才也略微的說過一點兒，廣告不一定是欺騙的，有的廣吿的確是物質廉美的憑證，而且這種眞實的廣吿，很容易讓虛僞的廣吿遮蔽，因爲用虛僞廣吿方法欺矇顧客的商人，他們的廣吿必定要比眞實的廣吿作的更觸目，廣吿文字也比人家更新鮮，而且廣吿的量數也比較其他的增加篇幅，地位，甚而致於推遠到各省各縣，所以眞實的商人站在商業競爭的立塲上，他絕不能看着自己商業的失敗，當然他也要在廣吿方面，擴充加大，使得自己的廣吿，能够跟對方抗爭，這樣一來，商塲就成了戰場！貿易就成了商戰了，可是旣成了一個商人，那就不能不走商業之道，我們明瞭了這一點，得馬虎且馬虎，何必爲了這些不値一氣的事，生那些閒氣呢？這都是我不好，我抬出你生了那麼一肚子悶氣，現在你祇要相信那大菜；是十足英國味兒的大菜就完了，別再懐疑了。</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Recently, there have been widespread rumors here that changes have occurred in Hebei Eastern salt affairs and that the Japanese side is organizing a North China Salt Affairs Company. According to personnel from the Changlu Salt Transport Commissioner's Office, the tax revenue from Lu salt reaches more than 20 million yuan annually. Although the current decrease in revenue is a fact, June, July, and August are traditionally off-peak months for tax collection and do not affect the annual tax revenue. The Hebei Eastern Tax Police Brigade is also performing its duties as usual. The various external rumors are still unconfirmed (7th Central News Agency)</p>

<h3 id="e15">After the Formation of the New French Cabinet <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>After fierce competition, the left-wing Popular Front finally won the final victory in the recent French general election. The power of the right-wing group has suffered a crushing defeat and its decline is irreparable. In particular, extreme right-wing fascism can be said to be no longer able to stand in France. Why has the vast majority of French citizens become increasingly left-leaning? This is because the development of the economic panic in France in recent years has been very profound. The prices of agricultural products have plummeted, causing a sharp reduction in farmers' incomes. At the same time, the urban petty bourgeoisie has been constantly attacked by the waves of economic panic and has suffered from the competition and oppression of big capital. They are all in distress and feel increasingly dissatisfied with the status quo. However, due to the extremely strong traditional democratic consciousness, the French people do not welcome fascism. Moreover, the stimulation of the actions of the German National Socialist Party has made them even more jealous and hateful of fascism. Therefore, fascism cannot breed in France. On the contrary, left-leaning ideas have grown day by day.</p>
<p>Now the left-leaning new French cabinet has been formed. But it should be noted that the new cabinet does not include all the parties in the People's Front. The Communist Party did not participate in the formation of the cabinet. In fact, it is formed jointly by the orthodox Socialist Party and the Radical Socialist Party. The reason why the Communist Party is unwilling to participate in the cabinet and only provides support is that the current cabinet is not their ultimate ideal. Their goal is to use the Socialist Party cabinet as a transition to reach a higher stage.</p>
<p>Whether this cabinet can last depends on whether it can solve the suffering of the people. The most difficult problem at present is the labor unrest. In recent days, the spread of labor unrest in France has become increasingly severe. The scope of the strikes has already spread to various industrial sectors, and even public utilities are unavoidable. The number of strikers has exceeded 500,000, which shows the seriousness of the situation. Among the bills that the cabinet decided to submit to the Senate and the House of Representatives on the 6th of this month are: implementation of a 40-hour work week; unions can sign work contracts with employers on behalf of workers; workers have one week of vacation per year, with wages paid. It is not certain whether these can be passed by the Senate and the House of Representatives. And even after they are passed, whether the capitalists will implement them one by one, and whether the workers will be satisfied with this, is still a problem. In addition, issues such as the franc, the League of Nations, Austria, and the Rhineland are also thorny problems for the current cabinet.</p>
<p>Also, the French labor unrest has a profound impact on the entire European situation. The workers' movements in Spain, Belgium, and other countries in recent days are actually related to the French labor unrest. At the same time, other countries such as Hungary may also be affected. Therefore, all parties are worried about the arrival of a major upheaval in Europe. Especially Britain, it is even more uneasy. Perhaps it and Germany will move closer together. If this is the case, the future situation in Europe may have a major change.</p>

As for the reason for the prevalence of smuggling, the reduced tax rate of the Hebei Eastern puppet organization by three-quarters is also a factor (6th Guomin Dian)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The visit to Tokyo by Sir Leith-Ross, the British economic envoy to China, at a time when important issues such as the increasing seriousness of smuggling in North China and the recent Anglo-Japanese trade relations surrounding the reform of the Chinese currency system and the Australian issue are looming, has attracted great attention from all aspects of Japan. Leading figures in the Japanese financial community, centered on the Japan Economic League Council, are scheduled to host Sir Leith-Ross at the Marunouchi Bankers Association at 6:00 PM on the 8th to hold important talks. In fact, after Sir Leith-Ross's entry into Tokyo, Anglo-Japanese negotiations will begin in a preliminary manner. Therefore, it is needless to say that the financial community will exchange views on issues such as the possibility of Anglo-Japanese cooperation in the development of the Chinese economy, the reform of the Chinese currency system, and smuggling in North China.

<h3 id="e38">New French Cabinet Gains Confidence of House of Representatives; Social Reform Bills to Be Proposed; Currency Devaluation Unavoidable <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) As striking workers abandon peaceful means and riot in the streets of Paris, the Socialist government of Léon Blum tonight won a vote of confidence in the House of Representatives, with 384 votes to 210. During his speech, Blum warned that all fascist officials in the government would be completely removed and solemnly declared his desire to maintain peace, calling on Europe to halt the arms race and advocating the immediate consolidation of the principle of collective security.</p>
<p>Blum announced that the government will submit several of the most important social reform bills next week to promote his proposed "New Deal." These bills include: amnesty for political prisoners, a 44-hour work week, collective bargaining for labor-management contracts, paid employee vacations, large-scale public works, nationalization of the arms industry, establishment of a wheat control bureau, extension of the school enrollment age, and reorganization of the Bank of France, etc. He also announced that the government will propose the abolition of various austerity orders issued by the Laval government. Once these bills are passed, the second step will be to propose amendments to the unemployment fund and government pension system, and to establish an agricultural relief plan. Then, a system to simplify the financial system and amend tax laws will be established.</p>
<p>As for the issue of franc devaluation, although it is of deep concern to all sectors at home and abroad today, the Prime Minister has not made any statement. The general public believes that devaluation is unavoidable. Those with the most informed private sources expect that it will be implemented through the following three methods: banning the export of cash, inflating banknotes to the statutory limit of 33% of cash reserves (currently 60%), and implementing currency restrictions. It is reported that the second option is the most likely to be implemented, as it can also restrict the flow of cash. It is reported that banks in coastal cities have been very busy with foreign exchange transactions today, with the British side purchasing large amounts of francs in pounds and then converting them into cash. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After hearing the new Prime Minister Blum read out the administrative outline including France's new measures, the House of Representatives passed a vote of confidence in Blum with 384 votes to 210. There was disturbance in the meeting today. When a member mentioned the name of the former Paris Police Chief Chiappe, Chiappe immediately jumped up, and many members shouted, "Chiappe to the guillotine!" The order was in chaos for a while, and Speaker Herriot announced a temporary adjournment. When the meeting resumed shortly afterward, a far-right member, Vallat, shouted, "France is ruled by Jews, which is a precedent in French history." Seeing the chaotic scene, Blum wanted to leave in anger, but was persuaded to stay. The crowd cheered him incessantly.</p>
<p>When announcing his administrative program, Blum said that the government did not want to manipulate the currency to raise its political expenses. The main events of the administrative program are: amnesty, a 44-hour work week, large-scale public works, and nationalization of the arms manufacturing industry, pensions.</p>
<p>Blum also mentioned domestic policies, including paid holidays, collective contracts, reform of the Bank of France system, and restoration of the salaries reduced for civil servants.</p>
<p>The new government's foreign policy is mainly to maintain peace, respect international treaties, be loyal to all responsibilities, adhere to the collective security system, and strive for disarmament. (Reuters, 6th)</p>

<p>Blum Exhorts National Unity</p>
<p>(Paris) The Léon Blum cabinet attended the House of Representatives for the first time today and won a victory with 384 votes to 210. (The 384 votes are distributed as follows: Communist Party 72 votes, orthodox Socialist Party 146 votes, Radical Socialist Party 110 votes, and the remaining 56 votes were cast by members of the Republican Socialist Union and independent members.) Here is a supplement to the meeting situation in the afternoon today.</p>
<p>After Prime Minister Léon Blum read out the declaration of his major policy guidelines, several members raised questions to the new cabinet, which led to disputes. Right-wing member Laurent spoke first and strongly opposed the implementation of sanctions against Italy. Moderate member Reynaud, who advocated franc devaluation, then elaborated on the theory of devaluation. At that time, when the Communist Party members saw Chiappe (who was the police chief when the riots occurred in Paris on February 6, 1934, and has now been elected as a member of the House of Representatives) also in the meeting place, they booed him. Subsequently, right-wing member Vallat spoke and denounced Prime Minister Léon Blum as a Jew. The left-wing members were in an uproar. For a time, the meeting place was in a hubbub, and Speaker Herriot could not maintain order and had to announce a brief adjournment. When the meeting resumed, Léon Blum requested to speak to reply to Vallat, but Herriot refused, saying, "I will personally resolve this matter." He then argued fiercely with Vallat. Later, Léon Blum took the stage to deliver a speech. (See another telegram later.) Several members continued to raise questions. Finally, the speaker announced the end of the debate and read out the vote of confidence motion proposed by the left-wing Popular Front, which stated: "The various reform plans contained in the Popular Front's political program are the methods listed in the declaration of major policy guidelines. This House trusts that the cabinet will implement them as soon as possible, and this House agrees with the Prime Minister's statement to quickly resolve labor unrest. This House hereby expresses its confidence in the cabinet." Then a vote was held, and the meeting was adjourned at 11:00 PM. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Prime Minister Léon Blum issued a declaration in the House of Representatives this afternoon, stating that the cabinet will announce the actual situation of France's finances within the next week, but no matter what expenditures are made, the cabinet will never take any action on the monetary system to subsidize them. "Because France can implement a large-scale credit policy, there is no need to resort to a currency devaluation policy." The Prime Minister then mentioned the strike unrest, saying that the reasons are nothing more than the following three points: the unemployment problem, low wages, and the different situation of labor supply and demand now and in the past. He also said that it is indeed a fact that this strike was initiated by the workers themselves, but in recent days, some people have been plotting to give the strike other functions. "The cabinet will definitely stop this, and you can rest assured." As for the workers occupying factory buildings, it was originally an illegal act, but the capitalists did not ask the authorities to forcibly expel them, and they will not raise this request. "At the beginning of the strike, we first took all necessary measures to ensure that the people's food supply was not in short supply, and now we are fully exercising our power in the hope that labor and management can reconcile." In conclusion, he asked the people of the whole country to unite, understand each other, and support the government, and announced that the cabinet would explain the foreign policy adopted to the House of Representatives before the League of Nations General Assembly convenes in Geneva at the end of this month. After the Prime Minister finished speaking, the members of the left-wing parties all stood up and cheered in tribute. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Newspapers commented on the cabinet's initial decision to attend the Senate and House of Representatives, all believing that the cabinet had obtained an absolute majority as expected. The orthodox Socialist Party's newspaper, Le Peuple, stated, "The Popular Front put forward new propositions when it was established on February 12, 1934, expressing confidence and a strong will. The cabinet's declaration of major policy guidelines has the same color." The Communist Party's newspaper, L'Humanité, stated that it was gratifying that the cabinet had agreed to submit various bills next week to satisfy the main demands of the striking workers. "This move can also create an atmosphere that makes the current labor unrest easier to resolve." Le Matin, Le Journal, and L'Echo de Paris all said that Prime Minister Léon Blum had clearly stated his position on maintaining the franc. Among them, L'Echo de Paris also stated, "Regarding the labor unrest issue, it is unfair to say that what Prime Minister Léon Blum said was adding fuel to the fire, but the fact is that the Prime Minister failed to express it in a firm, clear, and straightforward manner that all workers could understand." Gringoire's famous reporter, Romier, said that the bills mentioned by Prime Minister Léon Blum were based on the promotion of a large-scale credit system. "But so far, what the Prime Minister has pointed out is only the country's generosity. As for the fate of the large-scale credit system, it will be determined by the application of tax administration, monetary economy. However, the Prime Minister has not made any appropriate announcements on this level. How do you know that if you want the large-scale credit system to take effect, you must create various achievements in production to repay the principal and interest of the debt before you can achieve it?"

<p>Maintaining Peace with the Same Aspiration</p>
<p>(Berlin) A certain observer of the National Socialist Party commented on the French cabinet's declaration of major policy guidelines, saying, "Prime Minister Léon Blum's declaration on foreign policy is very clear, especially the statement that France is willing to live in peace with all countries in the world, which is most noteworthy. This so-called peace is France's long-standing advocacy of an indivisible peace. Regarding this level, German Führer Hitler has repeatedly delivered speeches, and the new French cabinet must know the German government's and the entire nation's desire for peace. As far as French Prime Minister Léon Blum's declaration is concerned, it also has the same aspiration and is not duplicitous." The semi-official Deutsche Tageszeitung stated, "Prime Minister Léon Blum is willing to conclude an arms limitation agreement with various countries, and Germany is still prepared to cooperate with him."

<p>(Washington) The situation in France is causing deep concern on the part of the government. It is reported that the devaluation of the franc is imminent, and it has become an inevitable trend, and the Blum cabinet may even abandon the gold standard. Informed sources here believe that the American financial community has long anticipated the above two events, so they have temporarily suspended all exchanges in order to consider future steps. Officials believe that the situation in France today is similar to the situation in the United States when President Roosevelt took office. Therefore, the general public believes that Blum's hand on exchange and cash may be similar to the hand taken by the United States in 1933. What is most concerned here is that the events that occur in France next week may have a serious impact on the exchange between Britain and the United States and between Britain and France, thereby affecting general trade and finance, and if France abandons the gold standard, other gold bloc countries may have to take similar actions.

<p>Government Authorities Promote Labor-Management Reconciliation</p>
<p>(Paris) Since the new Prime Minister Blum read out the cabinet's declaration of major policy guidelines in the House of Representatives yesterday and the House of Representatives passed the vote of confidence in the new Prime Minister, there is hope that the strike movement will be resolved soon. It is reported that after the Secretary-General of the General Confederation of Labor met with several members of the House of Representatives of the People's Front today, he notified the government that the strikers are expected to resume work tomorrow. It is also reported that representatives of employers and laborers will meet in Blum's office this afternoon to discuss the resumption of work. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the strike situation, after the Minister of the Interior Salengro consulted with the Secretary-General of the United General Confederation of Labor Jouhaux yesterday afternoon, there was a clear turning point this morning, and there is great hope for a quick resolution. All newspapers have been published as usual, and the rumors that electricity, tap water, and gas will be cut off, which were transmitted yesterday, have also disappeared invisibly. All industries, especially the metallurgical industry, are allowed. Representatives of labor and management are generally expected to reach an agreement today. Representatives of various trade unions are scheduled to meet this morning to discuss the various demands put forward by the striking workers and to formulate a draft agreement for submission to the Minister of the Interior Salengro and the Minister of Labor Lebas as the basis for resolution. The general public believes that the government will definitely take immediate action to promote reconciliation. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the resolution of the strike, Prime Minister Léon Blum requested the General Confederation of Labor and the Employers' Federation this morning to immediately start negotiations and seek conditions for resuming work. The General Confederation of Labor and the Employers' Federation agreed to conduct negotiations this afternoon. The Employers' Federation has also appointed Tuchemine, the president of the French Industrial Federation, Lieppe, the secretary-general of the Iron and Steel Industry Association, and the chairman of the Metallurgical Industry Association, and the chairman of the Paris Chamber of Commerce as representatives. The General Confederation of Labor will be led by Secretary-General Jouhaux and three trade union representatives. At that time, Prime Minister Léon Blum and Minister of the Interior Salengro will serve as chairmen. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Although the new Prime Minister Blum has proposed a labor reform plan, there is still no sign of a turning point in the labor unrest. Aspects that were not involved before are now also responding one after another, such as the printing industry, the clothing industry, and the advertising industry are all affected, and the employees of large insurance companies also show signs of unrest. Twenty thousand steelworkers from Maubeuge in the Nord province, textile workers from Hatzipal, and workers from Tourcoing have stopped work one after another in recent days. Seven factories in Aumont-lès-Strassburg, the factory owners closed their doors by themselves, and the workers climbed over the walls and occupied them. It is estimated that there are 200,000 strikers in northern France. The express trains departing from Calais and Marseille now have no sleeping cars or dining cars. Miners in Calais, Boulogne, and Anzin in the Nord province have all decided to strike on Monday, which is the most serious development yesterday. It is quite difficult for residents of Paris to engage in entertainment today because there is a lack of gasoline and they cannot travel by car, and many sports have been suspended. However, Secretary-General of the Labor Union Jouhaux is currently consulting with many members of the House of Representatives of the People's Front, which may lead to hope for resolving the labor unrest. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Although the strike unrest in the capital area has shown a downward trend, it has expanded in the provinces. 1,700 sugar refinery workers in the port of Marseille have now stopped work and occupied the factory. Dockworkers there have also stopped work one after another, and the postal ship "Corsica Cape" has therefore failed to set sail. The labor unrest in the northern region also suddenly expanded last night. The newspapers in Lille and Roubaix failed to publish. Street cleaners in the port of Havre stopped work this morning, but electricity, gas, tap water, and food can be supplied as usual, and there is no shortage. (Havas, 7th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Foreign Ministry Institutional Reform Committee for coping with the international situation in times of emergency has begun to accelerate the formulation of a reform plan by the Standing Committee within this month. This time, the reform plan for the part of the ministry has been decided. After being approved by Foreign Minister Arita, it will be decided by the ministry council and added to the budget for the next fiscal year. It can be proposed to the cabinet meeting on the 3rd of next month and can be decided according to the original plan. The rest is the institutional reform of overseas embassies, which will take some time because foreign envoys need to report on various matters. The main points of this amendment are roughly to add the position of Assistant Vice-Minister under the current Vice-Minister, newly establish the Political Affairs Bureau, expand official residences, and newly establish departments such as the General Affairs Bureau. The commercial institutions are also being expanded, and the investigation department is being reorganized. This is its main point. If it can be applied appropriately, the current situation of the three bureaus of Europe and Asia, East Asia, and the Americas standing side by side, which lacks contact, will open a new face in diplomatic policy. The three bureau chiefs are scheduled to be appointed by imperial decree. In view of the progress of Japan's foreign trade and the difficulty of competition in overseas markets, the Ministry of Commerce intends to seek cooperation with relevant provinces to strengthen it. It will temporarily add a section in order to enhance its function. The other ministries and bureaus will generally maintain the status quo. Therefore, the concrete strategies and budgetary aspects for increasing personnel and cultivating capable diplomatic officials can be decided within ten days. (Domei News Agency, 7th)</p>

<h3 id="e50">British Foreign Secretary Expresses Willingness to Promote a Western European Non-Aggression Pact; Limitation of Air Armaments Is Especially Welcome; Support for the League of Nations Remains Unchanged <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Eden gave an important speech on the diplomatic situation in the Warwick County constituency today. The main points are three: The League of Nations affairs should continue to exist, and the League of Nations should be strengthened by the member states agreeing to revise the Covenant. The British mainland army has the task of defending against air attacks, and its nature is extremely important. The government hopes that Germany will promptly submit a reply on the British issue, so that Britain can be satisfied. The Foreign Secretary said, "Looking at the world today, the best tool for maintaining international peace is the League of Nations, so the British government's trust in the League of Nations has not diminished in the slightest." Referring to the issue of concluding international agreements to limit and reduce armaments, he said that under the current environment, this matter is still inconvenient, but once the opportunity comes, it can be missed by handing over. However, if countries all over the world are not preparing for war, Britain will turn a blind eye. What is the danger? It is necessary to be prepared for a rainy day. Therefore, public opinion and employers must make it convenient for young people to join the mainland army, so that after training, they can be used to defend the coast and resist air attacks. The Foreign Secretary then mentioned the situation in Western Europe, saying, "We should be concerned about maintaining peace without limiting the region. However, there are some areas where we feel particularly painful once chaos occurs. The Western European corner is an example. In early March of this year, after the German army entered the Rhine region, the situation in Western Europe suddenly became serious, and the crisis was pervasive and ready to break out. The British government then went out to find ways to restore international security and restore mutual confidence among Western European countries within the scope of the League of Nations. The reason for this is that the situation in Western Europe and British interests are more pressing. I hereby solemnly declare that Britain is prepared to sign a Western European mutual assistance and non-aggression pact. If this pact can be included in the air pact and another method for limiting air armaments is formulated, it will be welcomed by Britain." (Havas, 6th)</p>

<p>Malta Is No Longer Suitable for the Times; There Is a Saying That It Will Be Moved to the Island of Cyprus</p>
<p>(London) This morning, the newspapers reported that the British naval base in the Mediterranean Sea may be moved from Malta to the island of Cyprus (also known as the island of Kypros). It is said that this issue is listed in the experimental national defense plan discussed by the governments of the British Empire. A powerful group composed of British nobles, members of parliament, and other officials in power is now preparing to submit a letter to the government, stating that Malta is no longer suitable for the times and can no longer defend the Mediterranean. The position of the island of Cyprus is very suitable for protecting the entrance of the Suez Canal and can provide various conveniences for all types of aircraft. It is heard that the parliament will give strong support to the above suggestions. (Reuters, 7th)</p>

<p>(Paris) A diplomatic correspondent for Le Matin in Rome claimed yesterday that if the current sanctions against Italy are not lifted in time, Italy will conclude an indefinite non-aggression pact with Germany, allowing for all possible consequences. It is said that this pact will be signed on the morning of June 30th, which is when Italian Prime Minister Mussolini can no longer tolerate it.

In return, Germany will also promise two things: 1. To respect the territorial integrity of Austria. 2. Not to rejoin the League of Nations. Regarding this point, Italy's demand is based on the fact that some parties are currently enticing Germany to rejoin the League of Nations to make up for Italy's withdrawal from the League," it is said.

<p>The capital of Australia: Murai, the Consul-General in New Delhi, met with Trade Treaty Minister Gullett in the Australian capital on the 3rd to request the withdrawal of the tariff increase and import permit system. He said that if the Australian government does not reflect, the Japanese government will have no choice but to invoke the Trade Protection Law.

Consul-General Murai again requested the Australian government's favorable consideration, and Minister Gullett delivered a formal reply to Consul-General Murai on the same day, stating the following main points:</p>
<p>The Australian government believes that there is no need to protest Japan's invocation of the Trade Protection Law to retaliate against Australia. The Australian government implemented the tariff increase and import permit system not to prevent Japanese goods, but only as a measure to protect domestic industries. Therefore, the Australian government sincerely hopes that Japan and Australia will reach an amicable solution, allowing half of the Australian rayon market and most of the cotton product market to remain open to Japanese goods. This is a statement that must be pointed out. (Dōmei, July 7)</p>
<h3 id="e64">Rural Life Miscellany <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>—Edited by Yu Qing-tang; Written by Jiang Ai-qun</p>
<p>Rural Life in Jiujiang (Part 1) Jiang Ai-qun A Glimpse of Jiujiang</p>
<p>Jiujiang is located in the center of the Yangtze River and is the gateway to Jiangxi Province. In the past, all domestic trade within the province had to pass through here, so commerce was prosperous and people gathered here, making it the largest commercial port in the province. In recent years, it has been hit by the slump in the rural economy, and all industries have declined sharply. From 1931 to 1935, as many as 144 stores closed down. Recently, it has suffered an irreparable misfortune: The train from Nanchang to Yushan has been opened, connecting to Hangzhou and directly to Shanghai. With the establishment of a new transportation route between Shanghai and Jiangxi, provincial trade has shifted from northern Jiangxi to eastern Jiangxi, further weakening Jiujiang's commerce, forming a spent force. Secondly, the area north of the Yangtze River is the border area of Jiangxi, Hubei, and Anhui provinces. There are many bandits, and floods often occur. When something happens, the provinces always try to shirk responsibility, forming a so-called "three-no-care" zone, which allows bandits and floods to grow and spread. Later, the Executive Yuan passed a resolution to transfer all the rural areas north of the Yangtze River under the jurisdiction of Jiujiang to Huangmei, Hubei, for the convenience of management. However, the area north of the Yangtze River has fertile land and rich products, and has always been the sole source of Jiujiang's finances. It is considered a sacred territory, but now it has been cut off, which is a major blow.</p>
<p>Rural Conditions</p>
<p>During the time when the province was most ravaged by the communists, Jiujiang was relatively safe, so the acts of killing and arson never penetrated into the rural areas. However, under the dual oppression of imperialism and feudal remnants, when the general rural areas were destroyed, Jiujiang's rural areas could not avoid this attack, or the scars of the whip were even deeper! First, in terms of the farmland cultivated by the peasants, how impoverished it is! According to the survey of Tanjiawan in the Third District in 1936: among 164 households, 20 were small landlords, owning a total of 267.3 mu of land (here, mu is called dou), averaging more than 13 mu per household. This does not include those who do not farm. Secondly, there were 21 independent farmers, owning a total of 103.8 mu of land, averaging only more than 5 mu per household. Then, there were 70 semi-independent farmers, owning a total of 471.8 mu of land, averaging only more than 6 mu per household, including their own land and rented land. Furthermore, there were 53 tenant farmers, owning a total of 209.8 mu of land, averaging only more than 3 mu per household. The lack of farmland is evident. Not only is there a lack of farmland, but each mu is also very fragmented. In places such as Liujialong, it is common to divide one mu of land into several pieces, which is not surprising. This is due to the hilly terrain, but it can also be imagined that this is due to the repeated division of farmers' inheritance and the convenience of landlords' rental exploitation. As a result of the poverty of cultivated land, farmers are leaving the villages severely. In Yangjiazhafang, Third District, there were a total of 50 to 60 households in the village three years ago. Now, most of them have moved elsewhere to engage in small businesses and manual labor. When I went to the village for inspection, I only saw the old houses that had been left behind, some were destroyed, and some had collapsed, filled with a desolate and tragic atmosphere, making you feel as if you were in a recovered bandit area. The farmers in this area are still diligent in farming. They are transplanting rice seedlings in the fields, singing: "Transplanted yellow seedlings turn green again, yellow seedlings produce gold, mulberry trees produce silk, painted bird nests produce nightingales, and study rooms produce nobles." This beautiful and melodious folk song not only reflects the characteristic of the ancient Chinese rural society where farming and reading were valued, but also expresses the psychology of worshiping and admiring "officials" because many nobles have emerged from places such as Tanjiawan and Dongchengfan! There are many people gambling everywhere, and the names of the gambling games are "Tian Jiu," "Single-Double," and "Mahjong." The loans for gambling are called "Fang Shao," where one yuan of ocean is borrowed per day, and a profit of one jiao of ocean must be paid. Another type is called "Niao'er Jiao," where money is borrowed tonight, and it must be returned tomorrow morning when the birds call—the interest rate is 10% to 20%. Many farmers regard gambling as a lifeline, and they are unwilling to give it up even when their families are crying on the line of hunger and cold. Also, farmers worship wooden puppets, which is a superstition that is not easy to eradicate in any province or county. It is even more ridiculous that the farmers here often invite wooden puppets to their homes to diagnose illnesses. When there is a patient at home, the head of the household respectfully invites the puppet to their home, beats drums, strikes gongs, burns incense, kowtows, and the prayer says, "Please, Great God, have mercy and heal the patient with a kind heart, and there will be a generous reward." At this time, the so-called "Ma Jiao"—the living representative of the wooden god—continues with a series of rambling shouts, issuing a "divine prescription," instructing the patient to take medicine according to the list. The divine prescription is written with licorice, ophiopogon japonicus, platycodon grandiflorum, etc., which are medicines that neither cure nor kill the patient. As a result, the patient is delayed, and they do not seek proper treatment methods, sacrificing themselves in an absurd and boring process, the number of which is unknown.</p>

<p>(Xuzhou) Various groups in Xuzhou and Haizhou recently telegraphed the central government, stating that the Yellow River's floods have been a constant problem throughout history. In recent times, the embankments have deteriorated due to years of disrepair. During each flood season, dangerous works occur frequently, causing huge disasters. Last year, the Dongzhuang breach cost countless resources and took a long time to close. Recently, the southern embankment of the Yellow River between Lanfeng and Dongzhuang is about 200 li long and is entirely made of sand. This year, the dangerous works are even worse than before. If the embankment is impacted during the summer floods, it is likely to breach. If protective measures are not planned in advance, it will be difficult to avoid a collapse. The protection of the embankment depends heavily on sufficient materials and labor, especially stone materials. However, stone materials are not produced locally, and transportation is limited due to inconvenient transportation. If an alarm sounds, temporary procurement from all directions will be too slow to be effective and will inevitably delay the opportunity. It is heard that the people of western Shandong have proposed building a railway along the southern embankment of the Yellow River from Lanfeng to Jinan to transport materials and prepare for the embankment defense. This is a far-sighted plan that meets the needs. Northern Jiangsu and western Shandong are close neighbors with shared interests. The elimination of Shandong's worries is the blessing of Jiangsu. The Yellow River defense plan is related to a century of safety. Please consider the past tragedies of inundation and spare no construction costs. It is deeply hoped. (Zhongyangshe, July 7)</p>

<p>Hankou Correspondence: Following the collapse of the Zhongxiang Xiang River embankment, the counties of Zhongxiang and others have once again suffered severe flooding. The authorities are diligently working on closing the breach and restoring the embankment in an attempt to salvage the situation. At the same time, they have requested punishment to clarify responsibility. Citizens from eleven counties to the north, believing the embankment collapse was due to the negligence of engineering personnel, have enumerated the points of dereliction and submitted separate appeals to the Executive Yuan (Jiang Yuan), Minister Jiang of the Ministry of Interior, the National Economic Council, the Director of the Pacification Headquarters, Chairman Yang of the Provincial Government, and High Commissioner Jiancha, lodging accusations and offering suggestions. The original petition, with representatives of the people, including Shen Bifang and others, listed as responsible, states approximately: The ten-plus counties downstream of the Xiang River in Hubei Province are the essence of the entire province, with a dense population and a large tax base, accounting for nearly one-half of the entire province. Last year, the Xiang embankment collapsed in Zhongxiang, and all eleven counties and cities, including Zhongxiang, Jingmen, Jingshan, Tianmen, Hanchuan, Anlu, Huangpi, Xiaogan, Yunmeng, Hanyang, and Hankou, suffered a devastating catastrophe. Receiving the government's concern for the people's suffering, substantial funds were allocated, instructing the Jianghan Engineering Bureau to construct a remote embankment, with Xi Dejiong as the director of the engineering office and Lin Youlong as the chief engineer, solely responsible for the project. Commissioner Shi Yuling served as the deputy director, and the county magistrates of Zhongxiang, Jingshan, Qianjiang, Tianmen, and Hanchuan served as coordinating members, supervising the laborers and working separately, which should have yielded satisfactory results. At the commencement of the remote embankment construction, Military Commission Chairman Jiang issued a major order stating that those who neglected the project would be dealt with by military law. The laborers, upon seeing this, were all terrified and cautious. Therefore, sections one, two, and three were supervised by the deputy director and the coordinating members, urging the laborers to work day and night, and were nearly completed. However, the fourth section was contracted out by the engineering office, colluding with the director of a certain private engineering firm, organizing the Jucheng Company, operating on a business basis, not using disaster laborers, but recruiting workers from afar in Anhui, Henan, and other places, only seeking profit. They did not use rammers, the loose soil was piled up carelessly, and the work was perfunctory. All measures were different from those in sections one, two, and three. Furthermore, a gap was left between sections fifty-six and fifty-seven of the fourth section, called a drainage ditch. Local officials and the people, upon seeing this, were all shocked and horrified. Although Your Honor, Provincial Chairman Yang, and Pacification Director He strictly ordered it to be filled, they secretly disobeyed. On May 26th, when the flood season arrived, the water-blocking dam first broke, followed by the water rushing out from the drainage ditch, and the water surged straight down, causing the downstream counties to suffer severe flooding again. This time, the embankment project mobilized several counties, lasted half a year, exhausted hundreds of thousands of laborers, and cost millions of dollars. The tangible and intangible losses to the people are even immeasurable. Now, we respectfully expose their crimes and thoroughly present them: The construction of the fourth section did not use civilian laborers, but adopted a contracting system, colluding with their private organizations to form companies, subcontracting layer upon layer, to make profits, which is their first crime. The civilian laborers had completed over 90% of the first, second, and third sections, but the contracted fourth section was only about 50% complete, as evidenced by Construction Director Liu's report after inspecting the remote embankment. Therefore, they delayed the project to wait for the flood season to come, which is their second crime. They only piled up loose soil and did not use rammers, the work was perfunctory, plotting to take advantage of the flood season to falsely report public funds during the emergency rescue, which is their third crime. They deliberately left a gap, which was not filled despite the instructions of various senior officials. They received the Yunxiang water level report and did not fill it for three days, waiting until the water-blocking dam collapsed and the water had reached the embankment before starting to rescue. Even important officials fled, making rescue impossible and construction unfeasible, which is their fourth crime. The original height of the cutoff dams for blocking the water flow was set at 45 meters. Construction Director Liu Shoupeng, Provincial Committee Member Fan Xiji, and Commissioner Shi Yuling of the Third District, fearing that the set height would not be able to withstand the summer flood in May, instructed the office to prepare sandbags and add a one-meter high sub-dam. The office ignored it, and the water level leaked through several holes at only 40.6 meters before reaching the Datantan, and then immediately collapsed, which is their fifth crime. The laborers recruited by the contractors were never sufficient, and there were also cases of deducting wages and unclear accounts of expenses, as evidenced by Committee Member Fan's report during the memorial week, which is their sixth crime. Summarizing the above six crimes, it is inexcusable. We should request Your Honor to strictly punish them in accordance with the Chairman's order to deal with them by military law. The fourth section has collapsed, the beans and wheat have been lost, the autumn harvest is hopeless, and the livelihood is cut off. The sounds of weeping shake the fields, and the sights are heartbreaking beyond description. Remediation should be promptly sought so that the remote embankment can be completed as soon as possible. If the water level rises during the summer and autumn rainy season, it will inevitably lead to a major disaster. The engineering personnel who have neglected their duties should be ordered to compensate for the construction costs and rescue the situation within a limited time, and success should be achieved by a deadline, without allowing any delays. We should promptly dispatch reliable personnel to be responsible for the rescue work to make up for the losses. Last year, the fellow-provincial associations of the disaster-stricken counties had planned to organize a Xiang Embankment Project Advancement Association to inspect the construction site, provide suggestions at any time, and ensure proper implementation, with the expenses borne by the local areas. At that time, Your Government had already appointed Director Xi as the director of the engineering office, Commissioner Shi as the deputy director, and the county magistrates as coordinating members, so it was not approved. Now, based on observations of the facts, such organizations are indeed necessary. We respectfully request that the disaster-stricken counties be allowed to organize an Advancement Association to facilitate progress and make the finances transparent to prevent corruption, in the hope of making up for the losses in the worst-case scenario. In short, the negligence of the office this time has turned the most essential area of the province into a swamp, causing millions of people to suffer the same disaster, and the loss of national revenue and the impact on finances are far from being comparable to ordinary dereliction of duty. Failing to enforce the law strictly is insufficient to appease public anger; failing to promptly seek remediation is insufficient to secure order. The urgent telegram is pressing, and there is no time to choose words. We humbly beg Your Excellency to consider it. (5th)</p>

<p>Wuhu Correspondence: In recent years, various constructions in Anhui Province have progressed rapidly. Provincial and county highways have been gradually completed, and traffic has been closely linked. Since the completion of the Jiangnan and Huainan Railways, goods have flowed smoothly along the lines, and merchants have felt great convenience. Now, at the request of the Anhui and Henan provincial governments, the Huainan Railway has decided to build westward from Hefei, passing through Yeji setttlement, Huo Qiu County, and reaching Xinyang in Henan Province, to connect with the Pinghan Railway. The second survey has been completed, and construction will begin soon. After reaching Sunjiabu, the Jiangnan Railway is still seeking to extend southward. However, due to the mountainous terrain in the Huizhou area, the project is more difficult and costly, and construction will only begin after the funding is secured. Recently, in order to develop the products between Anhui and Zhejiang, the Ministry of Railways has advanced the construction of the Xuanqu section of the Jingqu Railway to connect the Jiangnan and Zhegan Railways. The route is 386 kilometers long, extending from Xuan City, Sunjiabu Station on the Jiangnan Road, to Tunxi, and then eastward into Quzhou, Zhejiang. The survey has been completed. The Ministry of Railways recently dispatched special commissioner Zheng Hua as the director of the Xuanqu Engineering Bureau, who has already set up an office in Xuan City. It has recruited 1,400 railway construction workers, who came from Beijing to Wuhu and transferred to Sunjiabu to begin construction. It is reported that a large number of workers will come in the coming days to actively construct the railway, in the hope of completing it as soon as possible. Following the two sections of railways built by Jiangnan and Huainan, one will connect to southern Henan and the other will penetrate into eastern Zhejiang. It is expected that the rich products of Henan, Zhejiang, Anhui, and other provinces will have unlimited development. (June 6th)</p>

<h3 id="e76">One of the Lectures on Biology: The Contribution of Biology to Mankind (Part 2) Xue Deyu, Director of the Natural Science Group of the Zhongzheng Bookstore Compilation and Translation Institute <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Based on Pasteur's research, it was also known that the suppuration of all wounds was also caused by bacterial action, which opened a new era in surgery.</p>
<p>Pasteur's research on microorganisms directly affected our daily lives, because it was known that the spoilage of food and other organisms was mostly caused by microorganisms. At the same time, it was also known that microorganisms come from microorganisms. We can apply his principles, put food in tin cans, and use high temperature to kill the microorganisms hidden inside. Then, seal the tin cans and cut off air circulation so that bacteria have no way to enter, and the food in the cans can be stored for a long time without spoiling. This is the canned food sold on the market now. We can sit at home and taste fresh lychees and jackfruit at any time, or taste American milk and beef from across the ocean. This is thanks to the research of Leeuwenhoek and Pasteur. Therefore, the discovery of microorganisms and the establishment of cells are a great contribution to mankind.</p>
<p>The second contribution of biology to mankind is the expression of evolutionary thought, which makes mankind doubt how all living things evolved, and how they evolved from simple to complex. This is not only a great contribution to biology, but also its thought affects all sciences, and indicates the direction that mankind should take and solve all complex social problems.</p>
<p>In ancient times, all kinds of creatures were regarded as created by God. This kind of thought has long been deeply rooted in people's hearts. Until after the Middle Ages, people gradually knew that creatures come from creatures. Many people have doubted the theory of God's creation. Therefore, the French Cuvier came up with a theory of "catastrophism", believing that all kinds of creatures were originally created by God, but after thousands of years, the world changed, the hills and valleys changed, and a great change occurred. The creatures that lived on the ground died out, leaving only fossils buried in the ground. Then God created new creatures. Therefore, after each catastrophic change, the old creatures died and new creatures were born. The fossils found in the ground are of course very different from the existing creatures. This kind of thinking was later proven wrong as human intelligence gradually improved.</p>
<p>The first person to come up with evidence of opposition was the British geologist Lyell. He studied the structure of geology in detail and determined that the changes in geology were very slow, and there was no sign of a catastrophic change that would completely kill all living things. Therefore, Cuvier's theory, based on the facts reviewed by Mr. Mi, no longer has any basis for establishment.</p>
<p>The next person to publish the opposing theory was the French zoologist Lamarck, who believed that creatures could not be produced suddenly. Existing creatures have gradually changed and progressed from previous creatures, and the reason for their evolution lies in the "use and disuse" of organs. The more they are used, the more developed they are, and the less they are used, the more they degenerate. These more developed characteristics can be inherited by future generations. Lamarck's claim is like this, but after other scholars' experiments, the results are not all like this. For example, if you cut off a rat's tail, the tail of the rat born in the next generation will definitely not be shortened. Therefore, the German Weismann severely criticized Lamarck's theory, and strongly argued that the reason for the evolution of creatures does not lie in use or disuse. The theory that followed was Darwin's theory of evolution.</p>
<p>Darwin made long-term explorations and collections in the South Pacific and South America. Based on the collected materials, he published the theory of natural selection, saying in a nutshell: creatures reproduce in geometric progression, while food and other necessities only increase in arithmetic progression. There is an imbalance in supply and demand, so competition for survival arises. As a result, the fittest survive and the unfit perish. Originally, the characteristics that each creature receives from its parents are not fixed, and can gradually change. This is called variability. Because natural selection acts on variability, creatures can gradually evolve.</p>
<p>Darwin used the theory of natural selection to explain the cause of evolution. Recently, due to the progress of science, it is inevitable that it will be shaken. However, although the methods of explaining evolution often change, the fact of biological evolution never wavers. This is a point that I hope everyone will pay attention to.</p>
<p>Darwin's theory of evolution was published in the book "On the Origin of Species" seventy-seven years ago, and has at least two effects on biology.</p>
<p>The first effect is to prove the evolution of creatures by citing various facts. Before Darwin, scholars such as Cuvier and Lamarck all discussed the issue of biological evolution, but they were all empty ideas without factual proof, so they could not gain the belief of the world. Darwin was different. He presented various facts from morphology, anatomy, embryology, and paleontology (please refer to my book "The Facts of Biological Evolution" - published by Shanghai New Asia Bookstore), making the previous empty evolutionary theory into a factual proof. It also made the general public have the concept that creatures are indeed evolving, which cannot but be attributed to Darwin.</p>
<p>The first effect is to explain the cause of biological evolution. Past evolutionists only mentioned biological evolution, but did not think about the cause of evolution. Darwin further used "natural selection" to explain the theory of biological evolution. Although it has been gradually discovered that the fact that biological evolution cannot be completely proven by natural selection alone, Darwin's explanation of the cause of evolution caused many scholars to delve into this aspect, which cannot but be attributed to Darwin.</p>
<p>After the determination of biological evolution, it is known that humans were not created by God, but have gradually progressed upward from lower animals to reach today. Both now and in the future, they are advancing step by step along the path of evolution. Not only humans, but all living things and the natural world on which living things depend are gradually changing there. In other words, the idea of "daily renewal and daily renewal" is as surging as the theory of evolution, which is enough to inspire our spirit and move forward to a bright future.</p>
<p>The contribution of biology to life is of course not limited to the above two points, but "the establishment of cell theory" makes us know that all living things are born from living things. After the clarification of biological evolution, it makes us know that all living things gradually evolve from lower organisms to higher organisms, which is indeed the greatest contribution to our ideological world (End)</p>

<h3 id="e77">Continuation of the Zhongxiang Xiang River Embankment Breach (Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper) The Engineering Office's Negligence in Key Projects is Undeniable; the Evils of the Contracting System Led to a Great Disaster <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The Xiang River Embankment in Zhongxiang County, Hubei Province, unfortunately breached on the night of May 26th. The floodwaters turned fields and villages into ruins. Hundreds of thousands of families in Zhongxiang, Tianmen, and Hanchuan counties suffered another terrible calamity. The greatness and importance of this embankment were second to none in the country, except for the Yangtze and Yellow River embankments. The difficulty of its construction even surpassed the notoriously difficult Dongzhuang section of the Yellow River. Therefore, from the beginning of its repair, the National Economic Council, the Military Council Headquarters, and the Hubei Provincial Government all attached great importance to it. Chairman Chiang even issued a strict order that "military law will be applied to those who fail to repair the embankment." Now, the project is nearing completion, but it suddenly breached, and money and manpower were wasted. Although it was difficult to resist the great flood, it was also due to poor planning. The reporter stayed near the embankment for nearly a week. Amidst the vast expanse of water, I witnessed the tragedy of displacement and wandering, and felt grief upon hearing the news. Standing by the river, my sorrow increased. It is no wonder that when Fan Xiji and Shi Yuling and others surveyed the breach, they embraced and wept bitterly. Since the embankment protects the lives and property of eleven counties and cities, I have made a careful description of the planning and construction process, as well as the cause of this breach while on the embankment. This is something that those who care about the Xiang River embankment are eager to see first.</p>
<p>The Planning and Construction Process</p>
<p>The Han River enters Hubei Province from Shaanxi Province, passing through Xiangyang and flowing south to Zhongxiang. The water flow is rapid, bringing sediment. A slight overflow would turn ten counties, including Zhongxiang, Jingshan, Tianmen, Qianjiang, Hanchuan, Yunmeng, Yingcheng, Huanggang, Xiaogan, and Yangxin, into a watery country. Hankou would also be affected. In the past, a large embankment was built as a barrier. In early July of last year, there was torrential rain for five days and nights. The Xiang River suddenly rose by three zhang. Sections 18, 11, and 34 within Zhongxiang County successively collapsed. The breach in Section 34, which stretched for several miles, was the largest. The breached area was scoured into a river, connecting with the Yonglong River, forming a diversion of the Han River. The National Economic Council sent personnel to survey the area and proposed three designs: "opening a river," "restoring the old embankment," and "retreating and building a remote embankment." After repeated discussions by the Council, the Headquarters, and the Provincial Government, it was decided to retreat and build a remote embankment. In early November, the "Xiang River Embankment Engineering Office of the National Economic Council" was established in Hankou, with Lin Youlong as the chief engineer, to carry out surveying and construction. Later, due to the large scale of the project, it was feared that the chief engineer system would not be sufficient to cope with the situation. The organization was expanded with the approval of the National Economic Council, and Xi Dejiong, the director of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, concurrently served as the director of the office, assisted by Shi Yuling, the administrative commissioner of the sixth district. Underneath, there were three sections: chief engineer, general affairs, and management. In December, the director and deputy director took office. On January 4th of this year, the Engineering Office moved to Shagang. As a result, banks, telegraph offices, hospitals, and shops were established one after another, and the wild banks and barren islands suddenly became bustling cities. The embankment repair plan was divided into two parts: one was the remote embankment project, and the other was the breach closure project. The remote embankment started from Jiukou and connected with the old embankment, passing through Shagang to Luohan Temple, with a length of 18 kilometers and 19 meters, divided into four sections and sixty subsections, each subsection being 300 meters long, about 13 meters high, and 7 meters wide at the top. The total earthwork required was 1.8 million cubic meters, and the original budget was more than 2.2 million yuan, which was increased to more than 2.7 million yuan due to the insufficiency. Sections 1, 2, and 3 were contracted by civilian laborers recruited from the five counties of Qianjiang, Tianmen, Zhongxiang, Jingshan, and Hanchuan. Each subsection accommodated at least 1,500 workers. The fourth section was contracted by self-recruited laborers. The breach closure project set up a breach closure section at Xiongjiaqiao, blocking the river in one place, with water-retaining dams at both ends. The right end was connected to Luohan Temple in the fourth section, called the A section water-retaining dam, and the left end was connected to Xinjishan, called the B section water-retaining dam. The total length was 5 kilometers, about 5 kilometers from Shagang. The dam top was 43.5 meters high, specifically to protect the remote embankment and prevent peach floods. Later, it was raised to 45 meters, and a sub-ridge was built on the dam to prevent wind and waves. Sections 1, 2, and 3 of the remote embankment started construction after the closure. By the time the embankment breached, 90% of it had been completed.</p>

<p>Zhongxiang Remote Embankment Breach - The arrow indicates one end of the breached embankment</p>
<p>Past Project Deficiencies</p>
<p>From the beginning of the construction of the remote embankment, various obstacles arose due to the imperfections of the contracting system. The so-called contracting system was that the county governments were ordered to select contractors from each district, who were selected and employed by the Engineering Office, leading the laborers to work. The contractors had no management or command ability, and they were free to come and go as they pleased. In addition, the price was too low, and the laborers' food expenses were in deficit. The difference between the upper and lower parties accumulated day by day, and they could only borrow from the Engineering Office. At first, borrowing was difficult, but over time, cunning contractors took the opportunity to borrow excessively. Most of the laborers who came to the embankment were poor farmers who were forced to come by political forces. They could not cultivate their fields. When they first arrived at the embankment, it was during the severe winter season, and each person was only given two reed mats, which were not immediately available even after repeated requests. Moreover, the terrain was low and wet, and they slept on the grass. It was said that some people even froze to death before receiving the mats. As for the fixed price, regardless of the distance, it was initially four jiao per cubic meter. After deductions, the actual amount received was three jiao. Each person only earned a few fen or one jiao per day. Moreover, there was no rice to buy nearby, and temporary rice vendors hoarded the rice. Even this meager amount was not enough to satisfy one's hunger. And when there was wind, sand, rain, or snow, they could not work, and they gained nothing. They had no choice but to go hungry. Under the double pressure of hunger and cold, they disregarded everything and fled one after another. After escaping, they were chased and captured by local officials and brought back to the embankment. However, they could not endure hunger and cold, so they were forced to escape again, captured again, and so on more than ten times. The laborers suffered unspeakably, and the officials were exhausted. Those laborers who could barely support themselves mostly hired substitutes. It was estimated that the rural areas of the five counties of Zhongxiang and Jingshan lost no less than several million yuan. As a result, the people were restless, and the construction on the embankment was also slow. The Provincial Government, concerned that it would delay the key project, specially appointed Commissioner Fan Xiji to supervise the embankment. The National Economic Council also sent special commissioner Chen Ruzhen to supervise the embankment. Fan arrived at Shagang in early February and, after investigating the situation, ordered the engineering authorities to make vigorous improvements. He also changed to the Baojia system to manage the workers, using the layers of control of the district chief, the joint guarantee director, and the Baojia chief to supervise the laborers and work hard. The county magistrates of each county were stationed on the embankment to supervise the work. On the one hand, the price for taking soil from a longer distance was increased, rice was purchased, more reed mats were allocated, and relief was provided to the contractors who suffered losses. The laborers were then able to work with peace of mind, and the project progressed. However, much valuable time had already been wasted. After Fan changed the system on the embankment, Sections 1, 2, and 3 were completed first, while Section 4 was still contracted by the Engineering Office to recruit workers. The project was slower, and the soil taken was sandy, making the project less solid. The disaster of the breach was thus lurking here. Regarding the gains and losses of the project, the reporter also inquired in detail when he met Commissioner Shi on the embankment. Shi said that the Jianghan Engineering Bureau initially sent a document requesting that the contractors be moved and selected at Jiukou before December 5th of last year. They rushed to handle it day and night and arrived on schedule. Many laborers also went to work voluntarily. At that time, the Engineering Office stipulated that the price was too low and the distance for taking soil was too far, which could not maintain the lives of the laborers. Therefore, the contractors did not dare to contract, and the laborers who came to the embankment had no work to do, so they returned one after another. Later, the distance for taking soil and the price were slightly improved, and the laborers gathered again in late December. However, they still could not maintain their lives and fled again after a few days. For a month, it can be said that no construction was started at all. The Engineering Office never reported this situation. Later, after investigation, the Deputy Commander and the responsible section chief were sent to the embankment to investigate in the snow. This contracting system seemed to be recruiting workers but not recruiting workers, and seemed to be contracting but not contracting. There were too many shortcomings. In January, he personally led the county magistrates and district chiefs to be stationed on the embankment to supervise the work. However, due to the heavy snow and severe cold, too few reed sheds, and the laborers sleeping in the open air, the cries were extremely miserable, and the price of rice rose, making it difficult to have a full meal. They fled one after another, which also delayed the work a lot. He had no experience in embankment work. After being stationed on the embankment for several months, he felt that there were only two principles in making embankments: the embankment is made of soil, so it is necessary to pay attention to the soil source at all times; the soil is carried by the laborers, so it is necessary to pay attention to the food and housing of the laborers at all times, and try to maintain them. Unfortunately, the Engineering Office did not pay attention to this, etc.</p>
<p>Causes of the Embankment Breach</p>
<p>Sections 1, 2, and 3 of the remote embankment were able to proceed quickly under the supervision of the county magistrates, while Section 4 was slow to construct. This section passed through the Xincong River channel, making it difficult to take soil. It should have started construction in advance, but it was delayed until the end of January due to the blocking of the water-retaining dam. After the river was blocked on February 11th, the ground in Section 4 was completely drained, but it was still delayed for half a month before organizing work teams and soliciting contractors. The price was even lower than in Sections 1, 2, and 3. The closer ones were 5.6 jiao per cubic meter, which still had to be deducted for the expenses of the team leaders, etc., and divided among 46 people working, with 53 people sharing the cost. The exploitation of the contractors was even worse than in other sections, and the laborers all regarded it as a dangerous path. Among them, there were contractors who formed a company, contracting 1,200 meters, from subsection 55 to subsection 58, and planning to recruit 10,000 workers. Construction started on March 18th and was scheduled to be completed on May 8th. As a result, less than 3,000 workers were recruited, so the amount of earthwork in this subsection differed greatly. There was also a water channel of 5 or 6 feet wide left in subsection 96, which was not blocked for a long time. The breach occurred in this section. The failure to seize the opportunity led to a major disaster, which cannot but make people feel regret. After the water-retaining dam breached, the water rushed directly into Section 4 through the old river channel. At that time, there were only a few thousand workers there, and the materials were insufficient, so they could only wait for the breach. After the breach was surveyed, it was 530 meters long. According to the section chief of this section, Ye Yushin, he heard on the morning of the 26th that there was a flash flood in the upper reaches of the Han River, so he concentrated 10,000 workers from the entire section to rush to build the main drainage ditch and repair the low and thin embankment body of the entire section to resist it. At 6 pm, the height was built to 45 meters. After 9 pm, when the water reached the foot of the embankment, he ordered the workers to take soil from inside the embankment to increase the height. However, this place was an old water trough, and the water flow was turbulent. Although sacks were thrown repeatedly and work was done, it was ultimately ineffective. At 10:40 pm, when the water level reached 44 meters, the foot of the embankment leaked, resulting in the breach. The total losses, in addition to about 50,000 cubic meters of earthwork, included 450 work sheds, 3,625 carrying poles, 5,000 loads of baskets, and 500 hoes. The deaths of the workers are also unavoidable. I am responsible for my dereliction of duty, and I have asked the Engineering Office for punishment, he said. A total of eight breaches occurred in the water-retaining dam. The first one was 110 meters long, the second one was 179 meters long, the third one was 201 meters long, the fourth one was 133 meters long, the fifth one was 62 meters long, the sixth one was 94 meters long, the seventh one was 155 meters long, and the eighth one was 238 meters long, totaling 1,172 meters. The section chief, Huang Yongcheng, said that all the breaches were overflowing, but the water marks on the sections that did not breach were still more than one meter away from the top of the embankment.</p>
<p>Breach Closure and Embankment Restoration Plan</p>
<p>When the embankment breached, Fan Xiji and Xi Dejiong were attending a flood prevention meeting in Nanjing, and Shi Yuling and Chen Ruzhen were in the province negotiating with Chairman Yang to increase the number of workers to assist Section 4. The embankment was the responsibility of Chief Engineer Lin Youlong, which was not enough to cope with the emergency. After the breach, Fan and Xi rushed back to Hankou. On the 28th, they arrived at Shagang one after another with Shi, Chen, and Wang Huzhen, the technical director sent by the National Economic Council. They exchanged opinions that night. On the 29th, they went to inspect the breaches together. In the evening, they held another meeting to discuss in detail and decided to abandon the water-retaining dam and focus on blocking the breach in Section 4. Wang Huzhen drafted a plan, the steps being bundling boxes, advancing, and willow roller closure. The earthwork required was more than 87,000 cubic meters. The important materials were more than 73,000 bundles of reed grass, more than 45,000 loads of willow branches, 2,000 cubic meters of rubble, 30,000 sacks, 10,000 willow wood piles, 7,000 coils of rope, and 7,000 loads of wheat straw or rice straw. The budget was 600,000 yuan. It was scheduled that from the 1st to the 10th would be the material purchase period, and from the 11th to the 30th would be the breach closure period, with 20,000 laborers, regardless of sunny or rainy days, working hard day and night to complete the breach closure work in June. By July 15th, the entire embankment would be completed. Regarding the material problem, in addition to ordering the original five counties of Zhongxiang, Tianmen, Jingshan, Hanchuan, and Qianjiang to recruit laborers again, they also recruited from the seven counties of Yunmeng, Xiaogan, Yingcheng, Anlu, Mianyang, Dangyang, and Yicheng. The county magistrates or the secretaries of the sections supervised the arrival at the embankment. Fan Xiji and Shi Yuling convened a meeting of the county magistrates and district chiefs of each county and encouraged them to work hard to recruit workers. As for the presiding organization, the National Economic Council sent a telegram on the 2nd, proposing to reorganize the Engineering Office into the Xiang River Embankment Post-Disaster Relief and Flood Prevention Committee, with Fan Xiji presiding over the breach closure and Xi Dejiong and Shi Yuling assisting him, and to act expediently. Fan was ordered by the Provincial Government to supervise. After the motor failed, it seemed that direct supervision of the project had to be reconsidered. However, for the sake of the lives and property of the eleven counties and cities, Fan, who was courageous and responsible, might be ordered to take on the difficult task in times of crisis. It was found that the soil in this section was mostly loose sand, which would dissolve when it encountered water. The fact that the water did not reach the breach immediately was also due to the fact that the embankment soil contained too much sand. Now, the same mistake cannot be made again. If soil is taken from the mountains, at least seven people are required to make one cubic meter, which requires too much labor and is difficult to accommodate. The water level fluctuates constantly, and it is difficult to predict whether the project can be completed on schedule.</p>

<p>A traveler wearing a silk short shirt and pants, claiming to be Feng Jinsheng from Jiaxing, 22 years old, stayed at the Datong Hotel on Songcao Road yesterday. He was sleeping soundly at night, and had not gotten up by 10 a.m. this morning. The waiter called him, but there was no response for a long time. He broke down the door and entered, and found that the traveler had committed suicide by hanging. His feet were kneeling on the toilet. Next to him was a suicide note, which stated that he was down on his luck, had no one to rely on, and was ashamed to return to his hometown. He asked for a simple burial and did not want anyone to be held responsible. There was a novel on the bed, which recorded the death of Emperor Chongzhen on Coal Hill. It was probably what the traveler was reading before he died. People said it was a coincidence. The hotel reported the incident to the police, who then requested the court to conduct an autopsy.</p>

<p>The Zhouzhuang Panlongxiang area in Suzhou is located on the edge of Cheng Lake and has always been a place where bandits emerge. At about 8 p.m. on the 6th, four bandit boats suddenly arrived in the township, carrying more than 50 bandits, each holding guns and other weapons. After landing, they set out in different directions to rob the farmers of the entire village. There were more than 20 farm families in the village, none of whom were spared. After about an hour of robbery, they were fully loaded and boarded the boat. Before leaving, they kidnapped Xu, the wife of farmer Zhou Fuqi, and her four-year-old child. They fired their guns as a show of force at the time. The loss was about 4,000 to 5,000 yuan. After the incident, the township's water patrol team immediately pursued them after hearing the report, but the bandits had gone far away and could not be caught. Therefore, they immediately reported to the Public Security Bureau. Director Zhang, after receiving the report, in addition to reporting to the county government for consultation with the water police team to assist in the arrest, also ordered the responsible sub-bureau and the detective team in July to strictly arrest the stolen goods and rescue the hostages. The 7th Brigade of the Provincial Security Forces stationed in Suzhou also sent a team to the township on the 7th to encircle and suppress the bandits.</p>

<h3 id="e81">Wuxi: Yuanju Cocoon Firm Robbed <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The Yuanju Cocoon Firm in Guyangfangqian Town, District 2 of the county, was originally established by Zi Cheng. Recently, it was rented to Zheng Cuichu and Ding Peiqing from Yangjian for business. It opened recently on the 6th. Everything was arranged in advance. The manager, Ding Peiqing, had 12,000 yuan in cash for cocoon purchases. On that day, 170 dan of fresh cocoons were received. At 9:45 p.m., some of the employees were already asleep when suddenly more than ten robbers arrived, wearing short clothes and armed with wooden shell guns and other weapons. The rest of the robbers were on guard outside. One robber went straight into the firm, first grabbed a young worker, fired a shot, and forced him into the accounting room, where he robbed all the 6,532 yuan of legal tender stored in the accounting cabinet (of which 300 yuan were one-jiao notes from the Xuzhou Official Mint Bureau). After the robbers obtained the silver dollars, they leisurely went in the direction of Meicun Dongting. Before leaving, they fired more than ten shots as a show of force. Because the firm had no police force to defend it, they dared not chase after them. They immediately telegraphed the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau. After receiving the report, Zhang Songxun, the director of the Third Branch, immediately sent the police to pursue the robbers in three directions. They arrived at the Yuanju Cocoon Firm at 12 o'clock, but the robbers had already gone far away and nothing was gained. They immediately went inside to investigate and found four discarded shell gun bullets on the ground, which were immediately taken to the bureau for filing. Ding Peiqing, the manager of the firm, came to the city yesterday (the 7th) morning to report to the County Public Security Bureau and the Security Team and other agencies, requesting joint assistance in the arrest. It was heard that the firm had theft insurance with a certain insurance company in Shanghai, and they had already telegraphed the Shanghai firm to send someone to Wuxi to investigate. Also, Chen Xilian, a resident of Chenxiang Village in Zhaimenzhen, about five miles north of Zhangjingqiao in District 6, was a well-to-do family. On the evening of the 6th, three robbers arrived, holding a rifle, and broke down the door. The robbers went straight into the bedroom and arbitrarily searched for valuables. They were robbed of only eight yuan in legal tender. Before leaving, they fired four shots. Chen Xilian's wife, Xue Xueying (24 years old), jumped into the river through the back door to escape when the robbery occurred, resulting in her drowning. It was also tragic.</p>

<p>North of the Yongning Nunnery in the county, a Ming Dynasty tomb was discovered the day before yesterday by the laborers building the Hangzhou-Hangzhou Highway there. It was of a grand scale, with a path overgrown with weeds leading to a passageway, with bricks and mortar peeling off on both sides. Inside the tomb were three coffins, all lacquered in blood-red. The middle coffin was covered with a half-rotten red banner, on which were written the words "Great Ming Shandong Investigating Censor, Canal Military Preparations Circuit". The handwriting was already blurred and difficult to recognize. The coffin on the left side was already rotten, and several pieces of stone meat and several copper coins were found in the coffin, as well as several other burial objects. The Security Team leader stationed at the Nunnery, Mou, led his team to protect the site, ordered that it be covered as before, and erected a sign to prevent others from looting it. According to nearby farmers, an old woman surnamed Luo from the Tingqiao Xiatang area in the city comes here every Qingming Festival to sweep the tomb.</p>

Unexpectedly, at night, the fire from the stove spread to the mosquito net and instantly burned down three houses. Nine thatched houses were burned down in the two neighboring houses. A three-year-old girl from the neighboring Gao family, who was sleeping, could not escape and was buried in the fire.

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>I have recently read the news in your newspaper's Taicang Correspondence on June 1 regarding the strike in Yuewang City, which is not in line with the facts. Zhang Sentai has owed license tax for more than six seasons and has been contacted by the county government twice. He has been summoned many times but has not responded. Our director was inspecting and supervising the collection in Yue on that day and still sent the original police officer Ma Yongquan to summon him for questioning to persuade him. However, he deliberately resisted the tax and falsely claimed to have been beaten, inciting a strike. We have now submitted a request to the provincial department for investigation. We hereby request your newspaper to promptly correct this to set things right and clarify the truth.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>

<h3 id="e92">Various Industries Prevent Smuggling <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Knitting Industry Association: The Shanghai Knitting Industry Association, in view of the rampant smuggling recently, has established a Joint Industry Anti-Smuggling Committee to prevent its intrusion. Yesterday, it issued the following announcement: "Since the rise of smuggling in North China, it has gradually spread to Central and South China. This not only affects our country's national tax revenue but also severely impacts our industrial and commercial sectors. It is a deeply distressing and malicious plan to undermine our country's economy. In order to assist the government in combating smuggling and to prevent the intrusion of smuggled goods, this association, after discussion, has established an Anti-Smuggling Committee. All colleagues in the industry must supervise each other and unanimously refuse to purchase smuggled goods. If there are those who are greedy for profit and forget their righteousness, secretly purchasing smuggled goods, anyone, or their associated partners, can report to the association and bear the responsibility of informing. Once conclusive evidence is found, we will request the government to impose severe sanctions. For informants, we will strictly maintain confidentiality and request the government to reward them. We hope that all our colleagues in the industry will work together to block smuggled goods and severely eliminate traitors in order to protect the strength of the country."</p>
<p>New Medicine and Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Associations: The New Medicine Industry Association and the Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Industry Association jointly proposed yesterday to establish a Research and Prevention of Smuggling Committee at the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. This is to be approved at the Chamber of Commerce's membership representative conference on the 20th of this month and then submitted to the government for approval. The document stated: "National resources rely on tariff revenue for funding. Observing countries competing to build tariff barriers to support their own industries and commerce, it is evident that tariffs have the function of protecting domestic industry and commerce. Our country's industry and commerce have long suffered from the dumping of foreign goods and are already in a precarious state, relying heavily on the protection of tariffs. Moreover, foreign debt guarantees also rely heavily on tariff revenue, so the abundance or shortage of revenue greatly affects international credit. Recently, the rise of smuggling has become increasingly rampant, not only affecting tariff revenue and undermining the foundation of the national economy but also posing a major problem for our country's industry and commerce. Although the background is complex and suppression is not easy, the urgency of the crisis requires our industrial and commercial organizations to rise up and assist in researching methods to prevent smuggling, jointly removing internal obstacles so that foreign vagrants lose their reliance. We propose the establishment of a Research and Prevention of Smuggling Committee and request the government to issue an order to all chambers of commerce and industry associations across the country to mutually cooperate. Is this appropriate? We request a public decision."</p>
<p>National Goods Year Meeting for Citizens</p>
<p>The National Goods Year Committee for Citizens of this city, considering the increasingly serious smuggling in North China and the significant impact on domestic industries, has decided to convene a plenary meeting of the board of directors at 3 p.m. on the 10th to discuss implementation measures, in order to awaken citizens to use domestic goods. Yesterday, it notified all directors to attend, stating: "Regarding the increasingly serious smuggling in North China, domestic goods are being severely damaged and going bankrupt. In order to discuss expanding the publicity plan to awaken citizens to adopt domestic goods, we have scheduled a plenary meeting of the board of directors on the third floor of the Gongqiao Municipal Chamber of Commerce to discuss measures. We are specially notifying you to attend at that time to jointly discuss the implementation, which is important."</p>

Yan Yinwu reported. Tea and refreshments were served, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Chairman Shen Junru reported, briefly stating that members were honored to have the participation of various officials and representatives of organizations. The motion was initiated at the 5th Representative Assembly of the Republic of China Lawyers Association in June of the 20th year of the Republic (1931), proposed by the association to request the Legislative Yuan to immediately promulgate the Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Law. After passing, it was submitted to the government. By September of the following year, the 6th Representative Assembly was convened in Guangzhou, and the Guangzhou Lawyers Association continued to propose the organization of a Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Movement Committee. After passing, 49 members of the Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Movement Committee were appointed in the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), and a standing committee was established. Joint meetings with local lawyers associations were held repeatedly. On June 5th of the 24th year of the Republic (1935), the first National Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Movement was held, requesting the government to promulgate this regulation as soon as possible. By September 20th of the 24th year of the Republic (1935), the entire judicial conference resolved to pass the Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Law, which was sent to the Legislative Yuan for formulation. The Legislative Yuan has already handed it over to the Criminal Law Committee for reference. Last winter, a Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Movement was convened in Hangzhou and passed, petitioning the Fifth National Congress. This year, the Third Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Movement Committee requested the 7th Representative Assembly to continue to strive for it. Recently, the Fourth Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Movement was convened in Jiangdu and passed, expanding publicity to promote the government's early implementation. Regarding the above process, the most important current matters are: Investigating whether there are wrongful imprisonments in various parts of the country, producing wrongful imprisonment statistics, and submitting them to the government for reference; the issue of recovering judicial rights is also important; regarding administrative and economic aspects, there are also many who are limited by the environment and lack the courage to make decisive decisions. However, we should unite with various sectors to urge the government to complete the Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Regulations, so that they can be implemented on the same day as the Constitution, in order to improve the organization of the country. After the holding of this movement week, we should unanimously and firmly strive to achieve the goal of implementation.</p>
<p>Speeches Recorded Together</p>
<p>Next, Zheng Qian, Chief Prosecutor of the Second Branch of the High Court, spoke briefly, saying that the more civilized the society, the more crimes there are. The purpose of the court organization is to protect the interests of the people, etc. Next, Guo Lansheng of the Command spoke, saying that the Command is a military organization, and what it executes is mostly matters assigned by the judicial organs. However, it strongly agrees with the association's advocacy and is willing to follow up to promote its success, etc. Next, Qu Shaoheng of the Doctors Association spoke, saying that it is said that you all are committed to the Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Movement, which is truly said to be something which touches the eye and moves the heart, and we sincerely hope that you will promote its success in order to reduce social injustice, etc. Finally, Mao Yun spoke, saying, We deeply wish that there would be no unjust matters in society, and if there are unjust matters, we should use the method of compensation to calm their hearts, etc. Then, Zha Dawei said that to seek a society without grievances, we should promote the rule of law and defeat imperialism. Yan Yinwu said that the Lawyers Association proposed the Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation draft, which was passed by last year's judicial conference and has been submitted to the Legislative Research Association by the Judicial Yuan for the Research Office to study, and then submitted to the Legislative Yuan for approval; expand the organization of the Legal Aid Association for the Poor, etc.</p>
<p>Broadcast Speeches</p>
<p>Last night at 8 p.m., the Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Movement Seafarers Association dispatched broadcasting propagandists Zhang Shijie, Zhao Zhijiu, Yuan Yangan, Dai Jixian, Qian Jianqiu, Cui Shie, and others to send programs on the significance of the Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Movement on various radio stations such as China West, Dongfang, Guohua, Donglu, Huaxing, Shanghai, and Lili. Excerpts from the speech are as follows: Today, the Shanghai Lawyers Association is sending representatives to broadcast on various radio stations. Listeners may think that what is being broadcast is legal common sense, but it is not. It is broadcasting the Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Movement, which is closely related to the listeners. Why? Because Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation is to ask the state to formulate a law that allows people who have been wrongly accused to receive compensation for damages based on this law. A person, born into the world, is always inevitably wronged. Once wronged, after the grievances are redressed, all the losses suffered by those who have been imprisoned unjustly can be compensated by the state. Isn't it a great relationship with all the listeners? Asking the state to formulate this law is called the Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Law. If a criminal defendant who is in custody is acquitted by a court judgment, or declared innocent, or exempted from prosecution for the crime he committed, then the state shall be liable for compensation for the damages he suffered during the period of detention. Even if he is convicted and executed, if he is declared innocent or acquitted or given a lighter sentence than the original judgment by the court in accordance with the retrial procedure or the extraordinary appeal procedure, the state shall also be liable for compensation for all damages during the period of detention or the execution of the sentence or the execution of the severe sentence. Although the main cause of wrongful imprisonment is the perjury of witnesses, or the false accusation of the accuser or the self-prosecutor, or the malfeasance of judicial officers, which leads to wrongful charges, the fault is not with the state, but the state should still be directly responsible for compensating the wronged person, and only the state can then recover the damages that should be compensated from the person who caused the wrongful imprisonment. This is called the corporate liability system. What we want to ask the state to formulate the Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Law is based on this point, because judicial officers are officials appointed by the state, and judicial officers should be fair and honest in judging cases. If the cases judged by judicial officers are not fair and honest, so that the people are unjustly imprisoned, the scope of compensation is no more than two kinds of money and reputation. The damage to prisoners is also no more than these two kinds. As for those who have been executed and then redressed, there is no way to make the person who caused the wrongful imprisonment compensate with their lives, so we are assuming to require five compensation methods: A person who has been wrongly accused shall be given an amount of one yuan to five yuan per day according to the date on which he was accused; the money and goods wrongly fined shall be returned to him in full; If the goods are wrongly confiscated, they shall be compensated at the price; those who have been wrongly sentenced to death should be given living expenses to the dead's surviving family; if the dead's surviving family has the ability to live on their own and there is no need for education, they should be given consolation money; if the reputation is damaged due to the wrongful accusation, the compensation ruling should be published in the newspaper for apology.</p>
<p>Film Promotion</p>
<p>Last night, before the screening of the films, all the cinemas in the city showed the lantern slides made by the Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Movement Committee of the Shanghai Lawyers Association, and the important significance of the Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Movement was made into simple and clear words, which were first screened for a few minutes, so that the audience could clearly understand the importance of the early formulation and implementation of the Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Law, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e96">The Authorities Pay Attention to the Recovery of Pilotage Rights; However, Almost All of the Pilots in Tongshan are Foreigners <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reported that, according to a reporter's inquiry to relevant parties on the issue of recovering pilotage rights, China did not pay much attention to pilotage rights in the past, so they have fallen into the hands of foreigners for decades. In recent years, China has gradually paid attention, and the Ministry of the Navy now has a pilot training institute to cultivate talents. There are already more than 200 graduates of the institute serving in various places. The four ministries of the Navy, Transportation, Finance, and Staff have established a Pilotage Management Committee in order to pay attention to all matters concerning pilots. All those engaged in pilotage must register and take examinations with the committee, so a part of the pilotage rights has been recovered. However, the recovery of pilotage rights in Tongshan outside Songkou is still under discussion. In the past, there were more than 40 pilots in Tongshan, almost all of whom were foreigners. Due to various reasons, recovery will still take time.</p>

All provinces, cities, and counties have reported bumper harvests. The price of rapeseed is about 8.9 yuan. Japanese merchants are flocking to the rapeseed-producing provinces of Anhui and Hubei to purchase it, as it can be used as a raw material for machine oil. In addition to the particularly bumper harvest in Anhui Province this year, southern Jiangsu and eastern Zhejiang have also reported bumper harvests. Rural finance relies on this to a great extent. The price of broad beans opened at around 4 yuan, and the price of wheat is about 4.5 yuan. The local grain market and financial circles have suddenly become busy. The details of the news are as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants Buy Rapeseed</p>
<p>Japanese merchants have always paid close attention to China's agricultural products, with the desire for "Industrial Japan and Agricultural China." As rapeseed enters the market in the spring, Japanese merchants in China have flocked to agricultural areas to purchase it. Early rapeseed has already been listed, with prices opening at 8.9 yuan to 9.23 yuan. Samples have arrived in Shanghai, and it is said that there is hope for 10 yuan in the future.</p>
<p>Flour Mills are All Operating</p>
<p>Wheat samples have arrived in Shanghai, with prices ranging from 4.5 yuan to 4.7 yuan. This year's overall harvest is good. More than a dozen factories in this city, such as Fuxin, Huafeng, Fufeng, and Shenda, had previously reduced the number of operating machines due to the gap between the old and new harvests. Now that they have recovered, they are preparing to fully operate all machines. Workers who returned to their hometowns have also returned to Shanghai one after another.</p>
<p>Financial Industry is Busy</p>
<p>Broad beans have also entered the market, with prices ranging from 3.8 yuan to 4 yuan. They can be used as feed, so all parties attach great importance to them. The grain market is quite active, and the financial community also believes that loans for agricultural breeding have shorter terms and less risk. Their business with the grain community has suddenly become busy.</p>
<h3 id="e98">After Zhejiang Released 60% of the Cocoons Purchased, Shanghai Silk Mills Started Operating; Approximately Twenty Mills Including Hengcang <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>After the Zhejiang Provincial Silk Control Committee retained cocoons purchased below the standard price, the Shanghai Silk Mill Industry Association telegraphed requesting their release. Now, the Zhejiang Silk Control Committee has not only released 10%, but has also sampled and tested the cocoon yield in order to determine the penalty method. As for the 60% that was released earlier, it has been shipped to Shanghai one after another. Approximately twenty mills in Shanghai, such as Hengcang and Xinchang, have started reeling silk. Currently, the silk price in the European and American markets for B-grade standard Chinese silk is approximately 550 yuan per dan (a unit of weight) in national currency.</p>
<h3 id="e99">China's Silk Industry's Exports Decreased Sharply This Year <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Shenshi News Agency reports that silk is a major export of China, world-renowned, and quite developed. However, since exports suddenly decreased sharply this year, the future is quite pessimistic. The main reasons are: 1. The increase in import tariffs by various countries; 2. The contraction of purchasing power abroad; 3. The lack of perfection in technology; 4. The dumping of Japanese silk. Therefore, in the European and American markets, etc., the number of exports this spring has decreased compared with last year. Last year's exports were 336,643 kilograms, worth 3,768,817 yuan in national currency. This year's exports during the same period were only 225,299 kilograms, worth 2,783,901 yuan in national currency. The decrease in quantity is 111,344 kilograms, and the decrease in value is 984,916 yuan. Moreover, because the US import tax on Chinese silk has been increased to more than 60%, and the lowest tax rate in other countries has also reached 30%, at the same time, since Central Europe such as Germany implemented controlled exchange, many obstacles have arisen for the collection of payment for goods. Moreover, the markets in Nanyang, India, and other places have also been seized by Japanese goods due to dumping. Therefore, China's silk industry should strive for innovation in production and sales, otherwise the future will be very bleak.</p>

<p>In order to assist agricultural production and sales, the Bank of China has been expanding loans to rural areas as much as possible. Last year, it loaned more than 6 million yuan to small farmers and rural cooperatives. The rural economy relies on this adjustment, which is not insignificant. It is learned that the bank has decided to handle production loans in Jiangxi Province, which urgently needs to be rescued, and has agreed on loan methods with the Jiangxi Provincial Rural Cooperation Committee. Ji'an, Jishui, Yongfeng, Xingan, Chongren, Linchuan, Dongxiang, Le'an, and other counties have been designated as loan areas. The Nanchang branch of the Bank of China and the Ji'an and other offices and branches will begin lending immediately to rescue the rural economy.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Overseas Chinese Li Zhuofang Goes to Hangzhou to Select Local Products; According to Him, Our Handicrafts are Very Popular with Americans; American Women Imitate the Cheongsam Style Quite a Bit <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese Li Zhuofang, who founded the China National Products Company in San Francisco, USA, recently arrived in Shanghai to purchase domestic products. A reporter from Datong News Agency visited Li's residence in Dadong yesterday. According to him, Americans are now very welcoming to Chinese handicrafts such as embroidery, pottery, porcelain, bamboo ware, and lacquer ware, and appreciate the exquisiteness of their production. However, machine-made products are far inferior to foreign products. At the same time, in recent years, American women have started to imitate the style of Chinese women wearing cheongsams, which is quite popular. Therefore, domestic silk fabrics also sell well in the United States. It is a pity that the US import tariffs are too high. For example, the tax on silk and Hunan embroidery is as high as 120%. The tax on pottery and porcelain is also between 60% and 40%. Therefore, it is best for domestic manufacturers to reduce costs so that they can compete in foreign sales. It is also learned that Li went to Hangzhou yesterday to select local products and will return to Shanghai and then go to Hong Kong to go abroad.</p>

<h3 id="e110">President Yang Peng of the Third Branch of the High Court Gives a Lecture on the Current Situation and Prospects of China's Judiciary, Concluding with the Abolition of Extraterritoriality as the Goal and Contributing Greatly to the Improvement of China's Judicial System <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>According to the Shen Shi News Agency, Yang Peng, the current president of the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, is a veteran of the legal profession, and his scholarship and morality are admired by all. He was recently appointed by the Ministry of Justice and took office last month. At the invitation of the Soochow University Law School on Kunshan Road in this city at 6 p.m. on the 6th of this month, and with the attendance of more than 300 guests, professors, and students, President Wu Jingxiong presided over the event. After introducing President Yang, President Yang stood up and gave a lecture on "The Current Situation and Prospects of China's Judiciary." He first pointed out that the four characters "phenomenal harmony" are the standard for judging the quality of the judicial system. Then, he outlined the shortcomings of the current state of China's judiciary and the steps and methods for improvement. He concluded by emphasizing the goal of developing and expanding the inherent spirit of the rule of law in our country, improving the judicial system to adapt to the current social and economic situation, and abolishing the deformed consular jurisdiction. Combining facts and theories, his discussion was incisive and insightful, contributing greatly to the improvement of China's judicial system. The Shen Shi News Agency reporter specially obtained the original manuscript of his lecture, which is published below:</p>
<p>Everything in the universe takes phenomenal harmony as the ultimate in beauty and perfection. All administrative or judicial systems of a country are naturally no exception. In terms of justice, the past judicial situation in our country, viewed from a modern perspective, cannot completely satisfy or praise us. However, judging from the economic and social conditions of each era, it still does not lose its phenomenon of harmony. Those who have studied the history of our country's legal system can understand its outline. Since the Reform Movement of the late Qing Dynasty, all the old judicial systems and laws have gradually been changed, and the speed of change is like lightning. For example, in the early Republic of China, the trial system adopted a genuine four-level, three-instance system. Then, the primary trial was abolished, and a simple court was attached to the local trial court. Now, a three-level, three-instance system is adopted. In terms of law, most of the public law part, such as the criminal law and civil and criminal procedure laws, are changed every few years. Almost all the latest legal systems in the world are quickly adopted. Because of the speed of progress, facts and the environment cannot keep pace, and various phenomena of disharmony arise. For example, on the one hand, the judicial organ has new-style courts, and all organizations and trials are based on law. On the other hand, the county magistrate concurrently handles judicial affairs, and most county magistrates who are not familiar with the law bear the brunt of the trial responsibility, resulting in many illegal judgments. There are many such examples. Now, the following points are briefly described: 1. Improvement of the county magistrate's concurrent judicial duties; 2. Striving for completeness of current laws; 3. Full planning of talent and funds; 4. The connection between judicial organs and other organs.</p>
<p>The improvement of the county magistrate's concurrent judicial duties: At present, the county magistrates in various provinces who concurrently handle judicial affairs often do not try civil and criminal cases according to law. In criminal cases, some judges do not make judgments based on legal provisions but according to their own opinions. Some judges even exceed the requests of the parties and make judgments. There are countless illegal facts. Even if a small number of cases are judged correctly, they are often flawed when strictly applied. Since the initial foundation of the first instance is wrong, it is difficult to remedy the second instance. This is because the opportunity has passed (such as the death of witnesses, the destruction of physical evidence), and it is not easy to find the truth in the second instance. Therefore, the disadvantages of the county magistrate's concurrent judicial duties are undeniable. At present, the people of more than a thousand counties in our country are under this bad system. In other words, more than 300 million people across the country have not been protected by new-style courts. If this kind of county magistrate's concurrent judicial system is not improved, the current high-level courts are like buildings built on sandy ground, which will eventually collapse sooner or later. According to Article 9 of the current Court Organization Law, county or city shall establish a local court. However, if the area is small, several counties may establish a local court. If the area is vast, a branch of the local court may be established. From the perspective of the law itself, it is complete and flawless, with the ultimate in beauty and harmony. However, from the perspective of the central and local financial resources and judicial talents, it is difficult to complete and improve this comprehensive and complete judicial system in one fell swoop. Therefore, the legislative and judicial authorities can only seek remedial measures. The central government has decided to improve the county magistrate's concurrent judicial duties before local courts or branch courts are generally established in various counties, that is, to establish a county judicial office in counties where no courts have been established. The Provisional Regulations on the Organization of County Judicial Offices have been passed by the Legislative Yuan and submitted to the National Government for promulgation. The important points are: 1. The county judicial office has independent administrative powers of adjudication; 2. The judges are appointed by the president of the High Court and approved by the Ministry; 3. The prosecutorial duties are concurrently handled by the county magistrate. The important purpose of this system is to gradually eliminate the entrenched practice of not separating administration and justice, so as to cultivate the foundation for the establishment of local courts in various counties in the future. The completion of our country's judicial system, if the whole country from top to bottom holds on to perseverance and moves forward bravely, it is not difficult to achieve success in a timely manner. 4. Striving for completeness of current laws: Since the establishment of the National Government, various important laws in our country have been gradually formulated and promulgated. However, a few laws are actually very important and have close links with current laws, but they are still lacking. For example, the Compulsory Enforcement Law, the Non-Contentious Case Law, and the Deposit Law are all examples. Regarding the Compulsory Enforcement Law, the Ministry of Judicial Administration has drafted a draft for the Legislative Yuan's reference. The Legislative Yuan is currently deliberating. As for the Non-Contentious Case Law, the Deposit Law, and even the regulations on compensation for wrongful imprisonment, some people proposed them at the Judicial Conference last year, requesting their formulation. The conference has already discussed solutions. In the future, the Legal Research Association of the Judicial Yuan may discuss this and contribute opinions to legislation. The importance of the Compulsory Law, Non-Contentious Case Law, and Deposit Law has been explained in detail by legal scholars and does not need to be repeated. As for the regulations on compensation for wrongful imprisonment, that is, the so-called Criminal Damage Compensation Law, how important is it? It is necessary to say a few words briefly. The criminal damage compensation system originated in Europe. Its basic theory is that when a person harms another, he should restore the damage caused by his harmful behavior to its original state. The same is true between people in society and between the people and the organs. Why not the organs for the people? Because of this, criminal law scholar Helic strongly advocated the criminal compensation system in his book "Opinions on Important Points of French Criminal Legislation" in 1821. Scholars from various countries followed suit. Therefore, many European countries have enacted criminal damage laws, but there are slight differences in their names and methods of regulation. This regulation is extremely important, needless to say. However, how to formulate it and how to implement it need to be studied. It should be specifically stated in the appendix that all current laws and regulations related to agricultural and industrial relations, as well as administrative laws and regulations related to the economy, such as transportation, health, fishery, mining, and forestry, are of great importance to the national economy and the people's livelihood, as are other ordinary civil and criminal laws. On New Year's Day this year, President Chiang, who is also the President of the Executive Yuan, gave a speech with the theme of economic construction movement, elaborating on his grand vision for economic construction, with clear and detailed explanations. After listening to it, we believe that in order to achieve the perfect realization of the economic construction movement, the above-mentioned laws and regulations should not only strive for perfection, but also make the effectiveness of each law and regulation fully exerted, so as not to become empty clauses. Only then can the economic construction movement succeed. Originally, law and economy support each other and use each other. Talking about law without economy is only a shell. Talking about economy without law, the economy loses its physique. As evidenced by the economically developed countries today, there is no complete law to be the core, and then economic construction can be maintained. Do you doubt my words? Please close your eyes and think. The civil law and special civil law that you have learned, such as the Company Law, the Bill of Exchange Law, the Maritime Law, and the Insurance Law, are all benefactors who maintain or promote the economy. Without these laws, the modern economic system may still be in a backward era. 3. Full planning of talent and funds: The implementation of any system must have three essential elements: planning, talent, and funds. The three are interconnected and indispensable. With planning and funds but without talent, the matter cannot be done. With planning, talent, and funds, the matter cannot be done even more. Although the current judiciary in our country has detailed and excellent plans, it may inevitably face considerable difficulties in terms of talent and funds. In terms of talent, since the late Qing Dynasty, scholars studying law have sprung up at once. However, given the vast territory of our country, the large population, and the large number of affairs that the country should handle, this talent seems to be numerous on the surface, but in terms of proportions, it is actually insufficient for distribution. Judicial talent is extremely important for the quality of justice. With good laws but without good judges to apply them, good laws will also become bad laws. For example, the provisional attachment of the security procedures of civil litigation was originally a relief system specially set up by law to avoid the inability to enforce or the difficulty of enforcing in the future when the debtor fails to pay the money debt disputes. It is actually the best way to protect the interests of creditors in civil litigation. According to the provisions of the Civil Procedure Law, the applicant for provisional attachment does not have to provide security, and even if it is necessary to order it to provide security, it does not have to be limited to money. If the judge does not ask whether the applicant for provisional attachment is right or wrong, or whether its current economic situation is, it is generally ordered to provide a large amount of cash security, so that the parties regard the application for provisional attachment as a fear. Isn't a good law turned into a bad law? Conversely, if there are good judges, even if the law is bad, it will not cause harm. For example, the French Civil Code was formulated in the Napoleonic era. It is the oldest in the modern civil codes of various countries. There is a provision that when a wife engages in legal behavior, she should obtain the consent of her husband. However, the French court believes that the recent economic situation of individuals is contradictory. Therefore, there are precedents that recognize that a wife does not need to obtain the consent of her husband to enter into a labor contract with others. There are countless other similar examples. From this, it can be known that although the law is old, if excellent judges are used to apply it, it will not cause harm. Therefore, the rise and fall of judicial talent and the rise and fall of the judicial future are like shadows following the form. Now, in addition to expressing regret for the education authorities' policy of restricting legal education, we deeply admire the spirit of the central and provincial and municipal education authorities' efforts in legal education over the years. The Soochow University Law School has an excellent history and has produced many talents. This school occupies an important position in the cultivation of legal talents in our country at present and in the future, needless to say. As for the funding issue, the current situation in various provinces, except for the provinces with sufficient judicial funds, the salaries of judges in remote provinces are very meager, but their service spirit is not therefore slightly lazy. The virtuous morals of sages and sages who live in thatched cottages and eat with a bamboo basket and a gourd are deeply instilled in the hearts of the people. Therefore, even if the treatment is meager, it is not enough to discourage their ambitions. However, the responsibility of the judge lies in fairness and justice to administer judgments related to the life and property of the people. The importance of its position goes without saying. Most of the judges in the border areas of our country now understand the noble purpose of life, which is to seek bread for work, not to seek work for bread. However, if they are often given very meager treatment, it is not the way for the country to respect scholars and value justice. At last year's National Judicial Conference, it was decided that the judicial funds should be borne by the national treasury. At present, the central judicial authorities are working hard to realize this plan, so that the treatment of judges in various provinces will be equal and will not be thick or thin due to the wealth or poverty of local finances. The problem of judicial funding can also be resolved satisfactorily in the near future. 4. The connection between judicial organs and other organs: The composition of a country is like a machine. The various organs from the central to the local are no different from the gears or pistons in this machine. If one part of the machine is not working properly, it will affect the whole. If the effectiveness of one part of the national organs is hindered, it will affect other parts. The reason is very willing and does not need to be described in detail. Now, just take the point of judicial police as an example. According to Article 209 of the Criminal Procedure Law, police officers, military police officers, soldiers, and others who are authorized by law to exercise the powers of judicial police officers on specific matters are judicial police officers. Regarding the investigation of crimes, they shall listen to the command of the procurator. Article 210 of the same law stipulates that when the police, military police, and others who are authorized by law to exercise the powers of judicial police on specific matters exercise the powers of judicial police, they shall listen to the order of the procurator regarding the investigation of crimes. However, in reality, it is not the case. Therefore, the activities of the police power are seriously affected. The command or order of the judicial police to investigate crimes is actually the soul of the inspection system. The above-mentioned defects were seen by the Ministry of Judicial Administration early on. Each department related to the year will consult with each other on this issue to improve the evidence of the procurator's command and the related agencies will be printed and implemented. Since its implementation, it has been quite convenient. In addition, the Ministry of Judicial Administration has recently formulated a charter for the allocation of judicial police in accordance with the Court Organization Law. It is currently consulting with relevant departments. The mission of this charter is to seek to effectively establish contact between judicial organs and military and police and other administrative or transportation organs within the scope prescribed by laws and regulations, so as to achieve the goal of completely investigating crimes, so that the various provisions of the Criminal Procedure Law regarding the procurator's command and order of the judicial police will not be the same as being empty. The above points are all the current situation of judicial improvement in our country and its future prospects. From the current situation, there is only progress and no regression. No one can deny it. What is even more advanced is that our country is working hard on judicial improvement from top to bottom. Progress is the duty of the government and people of a country under the rule of law. At the same time, we also hope that the current consular jurisdiction that is being restricted can be lifted immediately. The existence of consular jurisdiction not only harms our country's sovereignty, but also hinders international commerce and causes legal conflicts. The people of countries that enjoy this right do not see its convenience. This aspiration of abolishment has been forgotten by people from all walks of life in our country, and insightful people from foreign countries also deeply expect it. In short, the country is now in a difficult situation. We are working hard for the rule of law internally and fighting for national rights externally. This sacred duty is actually the goal of all legal scholars. What has been said today is only a general outline for your study.</p>

<p>Since Xu Fu concurrently served as the director of the Land Bureau in this city, he has spared no effort to rectify the bureau's affairs. Cases that have been accumulating for years have been successively cleared and concluded, and he has been particularly swift and decisive in eradicating previous long-standing malpractices. A person named Han Qixiang reported to the municipal government that Ye Changfu and Zhang Xifan, staff members of the Third Section of the Bureau, were extorting money. Director Xu immediately sent personnel to investigate upon receiving the information and closed the case, recognizing that the staff members were suspected of accepting bribes. The two staff members were transferred to the local court for investigation and to await legal proceedings in accordance with the law. It is reported that Director Xu advocates fairness in matters such as citizens renewing their certificates. Any staff member who is found to have been extorting money after being reported and found to have factual evidence will definitely be dealt with strictly according to the law and will not be tolerated.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Central Savings Society Increases Lottery Prizes; Grand Prize Remains at 25,000 Yuan; First, Second, Third, and Fourth Prizes Increased to Eight Each <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Central Savings Society's business has been exceptionally prosperous. During the first lottery draw, due to being newly established, there were only slightly more than 9,000 ticket numbers. The 25,000 yuan grand prize required the society to subsidize over 20,000 yuan. In addition, there were four each of the first, second, third, and fourth prizes, four consolation prizes, and 913 last prizes. When the second lottery draw was held last month, although the number of ticket numbers had increased to slightly over 13,000, the society still had to subsidize over 18,000 yuan for the grand prize. At the same time, the first, second, third, and fourth prizes were increased to six each, and there were over 1,300 last prizes. It is reported that the third lottery draw will be held publicly at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce on June 15th. The grand prize will remain at 25,000 yuan, with the society guaranteeing to cover the full amount. The first, second, third, and fourth prizes will be increased to eight each due to the increased number of ticket numbers. Because the society has successively established branches throughout the country, it is very convenient for depositors to make payments and collect prizes. Moreover, with the increase in prize amounts, the chances of winning have increased, so everyone is competing to join the society. It is also reported that among the depositors who won the grand prize in the second lottery draw on May 15th was Mr. Huang Changle of Nanjing, who was a former depositor of the Sino-French Savings Society and had exchanged his old deposit certificate to continue depositing with the Central Savings Society. Now, he has unexpectedly won the grand prize, and the prize money is more than that stipulated by the previous Sino-French Savings Society. Therefore, many former depositors of the Sino-French Savings Society, upon hearing this, are successively requesting to exchange their old deposit certificates to continue depositing, resulting in even more overcrowding.</p>

<p>According to Shen Shi News Agency, the Shanghai Pawnshop Association issued a notice to all pawnshops yesterday stating: "Upon investigation, the current selling prices of clothing packages can barely maintain capital, which is due to the tightened loan values of goods received last year. In fact, raw material prices continue to decline, and the market remains sluggish. Such a superficial market situation cannot last. For the sake of the future interests of our fellow pawnbrokers, this association earnestly issues a factual and sincere notice, so as not to be dazzled. We hope that all pawnbrokers and shop owners will be informed and carefully adhere to the old practices, not to relax credit and increase loan values, so as to slightly maintain capital and avoid repeating past mistakes." This notice is hereby issued.</p>

<p>A reporter from the Shen Shi News Agency, having heard rumors that a Japanese merchant organization was forming an exchange and that Lu Zhushuang and Wang Jimei, among others, had been appointed as directors, specifically visited Mr. Wang at Ziyuan. He was received and informed that he had gone to Beijing on private business a few days ago and had only recently returned to Shanghai. He knew nothing about being appointed as a director and was even more baffled as to the source of the rumors. He also said that he had lived by selling paintings in recent years and had very little contact with the outside world. He then showed a recent painting, which, upon examination, was deeply admired. It is said that Mr. Wang's painting skills were personally taught by his father, Mr. Wang Yiting, and he was known as a child prodigy from a young age. In recent years, he has devoted himself to research and has achieved remarkable results. To say that he has surpassed his father is certainly no exaggeration. From this, it can be seen that the aforementioned claim of being appointed as a director of a Japanese merchant exchange is definitely not true.</p>

<p>The Fu'an Company Amusement Park at the corner of Dongmen Road in the Nanshi district experienced a chaotic scene last night around 6 p.m. During the initial performance of the four-part "Peng Gong'an," the park was swarming with visitors because it was a Saturday. The front gate of the park is under the jurisdiction of the Yiting Police Station, while the rear gate falls under the jurisdiction of the Shiliupu Sub-bureau. Unexpectedly, a fire broke out on the third floor of the Yongyutai Ginseng Shop next to the rear gate, immediately filling the air with thick smoke. Soon flames burst through the roof. The northern wind fanned the flames directly toward the third-floor windows of the amusement park. Tourists were horrified and began fleeing. Many ignorant women and children wailed and screamed, creating chaos. Those who tried to escape using the rear staircase were crushed and trampled in the rush. The iron supports on the lower level buckled, and the cement handrail collapsed, causing men and women tourists to fall from the stairs. Some were unable to get up immediately and were trampled and injured. A 17-year-old Ningbo native named Fang Xianming sustained the most serious injuries and lost consciousness. Fortunately, police officers stationed at the park made every effort to control the crowd. They rescued Fang and sent him to Nanyang Hospital for treatment. Doctors reported that his condition was critical. An elderly woman, a middle-aged woman, and a girl were also injured, and their families took them to the hospital for treatment. The incident was reported to the Yiting Police Station. Chief Yu personally led officers to investigate the scene and planned to report to the General Bureau for instructions.</p>

<p>Xiao Hongying, a 12-year-old Cantonese boy residing at No. 12, Tianshui Road, was walking home from school around 11:30 a.m. on July 24th of last year when he saw Geng Zhaolin, a native of Suzhou, setting up a stall near the intersection of North Henan Road and Tianshui Road to perform magic tricks. He had hung a white cloth with the words "Living Magic Research Society" written on it, advertising various acts such as "Immortal Picking Beans," "Fetching Water Across the Mountain," and "Flying Star Playing Cards." He held a deck of playing cards and threw them into the air as he performed his skills (i.e., Flying Star Playing Cards). The boy was delighted and asked to learn the tricks. Geng Zhaolin said that those who wished to learn this skill must give him a piece of gold jewelry for him to pray over, after which the magic would be particularly effective. Xiao went home and obtained a gold ring worth six yuan from his sister and handed it over to Geng. Geng folded a piece of white paper with the four characters "Flying Star Playing Cards" written on it and told the boy to quickly return home and open it to understand the trick, and then come back to ask him if he wanted to learn more. The boy ran home and opened the paper, only to find the same four characters written on it. When he went back to the spot, Geng had vanished. The boy realized he had been cheated and could only cry and tell his sister. The afternoon before yesterday, Xiao was passing by North Xizang Road when he saw Geng using the same method to trick other children into learning magic tricks. He immediately called Hua Pu at No. 300 and detective Chen Xikang, who arrived and arrested Geng. They took the white cloth sign for the "Living Magic Research Society" and a deck of playing cards to the Hongkou Police Station for custody. The day before yesterday, they were transferred to the Third Criminal Court of the First Court. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, briefly described the previous events and requested an investigation. The detective and Xiao described the events, and the evidence was presented for inspection. The defendant bowed his head without a word and begged for leniency. Judge Jiang Shuzi sentenced Geng Zhaolin to four months in prison, and the evidence was confiscated.</p>

<p>Tang Baixiang, a 24-year-old native of Suzhou residing at No. 47, Lane 2, New Zhazha Road, in the Public Concession, worked as a collection officer at the Dachang Automobile Manufacturing and Repair Factory at Nos. 59 and 60, Wusongjiang Road, in the French Concession. Recently, it was discovered by his employer that he had embezzled more than 40 yuan, and he was ordered to repay it by the 6th of this month. Although Tang agreed, he was unable to raise the funds, which led him to contemplate suicide. Using the alias Shi Junji, he went to the Anshang Inn at No. 35, West Xinzha Bridge Street, in the French Concession on the night of the 5th and booked Room No. 6. He got up and went out around 10:00 AM on the 6th, purchased raw opium, and returned to the inn around 1:00 PM, where he closed the door and lay down to smoke the opium and commit suicide. Around 5:30 PM in the evening, he groaned in pain from the poison. The tea server, Yao Bangrui, noticed and knocked on the door, but there was no response. The door was bolted from the inside, so he pried open the window and saw Tang lying in bed after taking poison, on the verge of death. He immediately informed the front desk and reported to the French Police Station, who summoned an ambulance and rushed to the scene. Tang was sent to Renji Hospital, but he was already too deeply poisoned and could not be saved. He died at 4:30 AM yesterday morning. The hospital notified the police, who transported the body to the autopsy room of the Tongren Fuyuan Branch, informed the family, and reported to the court for an examination today.</p>

<p>Gu Zhuxuan, a native of Yancheng, was arrested for murder and sentenced to 15 years in prison. During the appeal period, he was detained in the external prison ward of Guangci Hospital due to illness. He bribed the head guard to smoke opium, and was reported by inmates Li Heshang, Guo Shanyu, Wang A'er, and others. The prosecutor of the Second Special Court investigated and confirmed the facts, and transferred the case to the French Police Department, which filed a public prosecution with the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. After a trial by Judge Sun Penghang, he was sentenced to eight months in prison (sentenced on the 27th of last month) and returned to the prison ward. Later, Gu recovered from his illness and was taken back to the detention center at the end of last month and held in the eastern prison ward attached to the Masnan Road Second Special Prison. Gu was unwilling to accept the prison sentence for smoking opium. He has now appointed a lawyer to present reasons and file an appeal with the Third Branch of the High Court.</p>

<p>Yao Changyu, who runs the Da Shanghai Dance School at No. 592, opposite the YMCA on Sichuan Road in the Public Concession, and Xu Zhiyi, who runs the Far East Women's Travel Agency in Room 516 on the ninth floor of the Continental Department Store on Nanjing Road, were previously prosecuted by the police for selling dance tickets without obtaining a license from the Public Works Department, each fined eight yuan, and ordered to obtain the license. It has been learned that these two dance schools have defied the order and continued to sell dance tickets as usual. This was discovered by Deputy Chief Inspector Xu Shucheng of the General Patrol Room and Western Inspector Watson. They personally investigated the matter and confirmed the facts and purchased dance tickets. They filed a complaint with the First Special Court. Yesterday morning, the court ordered Yao Changyu and Xu Zhiyi to appear in court for questioning. Xu failed to appear, and only Yao complied. Deputy Chief Inspector Xu Shucheng explained the previous events, stating that after the last fine, the police discovered that Yao was still selling dance tickets, so they requested the court to issue a summons. Last night at 10:00 PM, he and Western Inspector Watson went to inform Yao that he was to appear in court today. They found many dancers at the school, and a woman was selling dance tickets at the counter. They immediately confiscated the dance tickets and ordered that they be retrieved after today's court hearing. Unexpectedly, Yao, after seeing them leave around 12:00 AM, falsely reported to the General Patrol Room that a Chinese detective and a Westerner had arrived and forcibly snatched the dance tickets. This was not true. After Judge Shen questioned Yao, he immediately sentenced Yao Changyu to a fine of twelve yuan. Xu Zhiyi's part was postponed for further review.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Shanghai Journalists Association Holds Spring General Meeting Yesterday; Due to Insufficient Quorum, Preliminary Resolution to Amend the Association's Constitution; Next General Meeting Will Elect With One-Quarter Attendance <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Journalists Association held its fifth spring general meeting yesterday (the 7th) at 2:00 PM at the YMCA on Sichuan Road. Ninety-three members attended. Huang Xianggu, a representative from the Municipal Party Committee, Hong Kui, a representative from the Municipal Government, and Lei Kenan, a representative from the Social Affairs Bureau, all attended to provide guidance. Because the number of attendees did not meet the quorum, the meeting proceeded according to Article 31 of the Association's Constitution (if the number of attendees is less than half but occupies one-quarter of the total membership, the meeting can still be held, but all resolutions passed at the meeting can only be regarded as preliminary resolutions). The following is a record of the meeting:</p>
<p>Meeting Proceedings</p>
<p>After the usual formalities, in addition to Yan Duhe, Tang Shichang, and Hang Shijun, who were recommended by the Executive and Supervisory Committees as chairmen of the meeting, Qu ShaoYi and Zhao Junhao were also elected as chairmen on the spot. Chairman Yan Duhe led the attendees in performing the formalities and gave an opening speech. Then, Huang Xianggu, a representative from the Municipal Party Committee, gave a speech, encouraging everyone to unite and serve the Party and the country. Next, Lei Kenan, a representative from the Social Affairs Bureau, gave a speech, stating that the news media is the driving force behind social culture and education, and he hoped that everyone would work hard to promote it and fulfill their responsibility as the voice of the people. Immediately afterward, the discussion of the proposals began. The proposal to establish a sports meet for journalists to improve their health was rejected. The proposal to organize a national journalists association to strengthen unity was put on hold. The proposal to improve the association's affairs was decided to be handled by the Executive Committee. The proposal to amend the association's constitution and change the election method was approved in principle and referred to the next Executive Committee to formulate measures. All of the above resolutions were made as preliminary resolutions and will be subject to formal resolutions at a reconvened members' meeting.</p>
<p>Amending the Constitution</p>
<p>Subsequently, Qian Hua, Yan Esheng, Yuan Yeyu, Zhang Jiping, Qian Cangshuo, and others proposed amending the constitution to remedy the lack of a quorum. As a result of the discussion, Article 32 of the constitution was amended to read: "If the number of attendees at the election meeting is insufficient for a quorum, a new members' meeting shall be convened, and the election shall be conducted when one-quarter of the total membership is present." This preliminary resolution, after being passed by the next general meeting (with one-quarter of the members present), can be implemented.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Chinese Ancient Coin Society Authenticates the Manufacturing Location of the Anyang Knife Coin <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Ancient Coin Society held its fourth research meeting yesterday. The research topic was the "Anyang Knife." Regarding the Anyang Knife among the Qi knife coins, everyone knows about it, but the explanations recorded in *Ji Jin Suo Jian Lu* and *Gu Quan Hui Huo Bu Wen Zi Kao* are all mistaken. Even *Qian Lue,* *Pi Tan,* and *Yi Qie Lu* have failed to accurately point out the location of Anyang. The society has now authenticated the manufacturing location of the Anyang Knife, which is the Anyang mentioned in the *Annals of Xiang Yu* in the *Records of the Grand Historian*: "King Huai of Chu ordered Wang Yi to rescue Zhao, who traveled to Anyang and stayed there for forty-six days without advancing." The city of Anyang is located east of Cao County in Yanzhou Prefecture, as seen in the *Comprehensive Gazetteer*. Based on this, it can be proven that the various coin catalogues are mistaken and their omissions can be supplemented. Furthermore, the first issue of "Ancient Coin Studies," compiled by the society, has already been published. The cover was inscribed by Ye Gongchuo, the vice president of the society. The content includes Zheng Jiaxiang's "Evolution and Changes of Ancient Currency," Chen Rentao's "An Overview of the Evolution of Script Styles in Coin Inscriptions," Ding Fu Bao's "On the Shortcomings of Ancient Coin Collectors' Lack of Knowledge of Weights and Measures," Xu Jiqing's "Preface to Rubbings of Modern Coins," and Yang Kailing's "Biography of Mr. Bao Zinian." The unpublished manuscripts of Weng Yiquan, Rao Dengzhi, and others are particularly rare and valuable. Starting today, they are sold by the Medical Book Bureau on Meibaige Road and the Shanghai Magazine Company on Fourth Malu.</p>

<p>According to Shen Shi News Agency, the Shanghai Branch of the Jiangsu Farmers Bank, recognizing the importance of the rural economy in the suburbs of Shanghai, has jointly promoted cooperative enterprises with the Yutang Public Education Center, using Yutang as the center and gradually expanding. The cooperative societies approved by the bank for loans include the Yutang, Qingdeng, Lincun, and Maqiao cooperative societies. Cooperative loans are intended for productive enterprises. Loan methods, except for marketing operations, mostly adopt the method of lending physical goods. The bank guides the various cooperative societies in handling these matters. The total amount of loans issued last year was nearly 100,000 yuan, with excellent results. This year, two more central areas have been identified for active expansion. Because Shanghai County is divided into two major regions by the Huangpu River running through the center, making transportation quite inconvenient, the bank's management of cooperative enterprises throughout the county is also divided into eastern and western districts. The western districts are promoted by the bank's Beiqiao office, while the eastern districts are directly handled by the Shanghai Branch.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Recent Business Situation of Chinese and Foreign Match Companies <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The various brands of matches produced by the Chinese match companies are sold in various ports and have been doing very well in business. Recently, due to the impact of smuggling, losses have resulted. The manufacturing cost of raw materials has increased, as well as labor costs, now requiring an increase of three to four yuan per case. It is said that starting on the 15th of this month, Chinese and foreign match companies will temporarily increase the price by three yuan per case to maintain capital. According to cigarette and money exchange businesses yesterday, the sales volume of matches has been the highest for the Phoenix brand. Later, it was said that the brand had a certain foreign shareholder and partnered with the Suisheng Company. After this news spread, business failed and plummeted. It was then sold to the Meiguang Company, which established a factory in Shanghai for manufacturing, with the certification of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, issuing sales, and hiring Mr. Chen Ronglu as the salesman. Mr. Chen and the leaders of the Chinese factories sought a consensus and organized a joint office and management committee to rectify market prices and maintain business tax revenue, benefiting both taxpayers and businesses. It has been three years since then, and the factories' businesses have gradually developed, with profits increasing significantly in recent years. Chinese matches account for 85% of the sales volume, while the Phoenix brand and other products of the Meiguang Company account for 15%.</p>
<h3 id="e132">National Goods Maintenance Association: Petition for Adoption of Domestically Produced Raincloth, and a Request to Increase Import Tariffs on Foreign Raincloth; Explanation of Three Points Distinguishing Domestic and Non-Domestic Goods <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The China National Goods Maintenance Association, on the basis of a letter from the Lianpu Company explaining three points distinguishing domestic raincoats, oilcloth, and other goods from non-domestic goods, has forwarded a petition requesting that all government agencies be ordered to thoroughly investigate merchants and purchasing agents who obscurely pass off foreign goods as domestic, thereby hindering the progress of domestic goods. They also request that an order be issued to uniformly adopt the “Flying Eagle” brand of domestically produced goods, and to increase import tariffs on foreign raincloth and similar items to promote domestic industry. The Association recently submitted a document to the Executive Yuan, stating, "We are submitting this petition to earnestly request that all government agencies be notified to pay attention to the three points that distinguish domestically produced raincloth, oilcloth, waterproof cloth, and other goods from foreign products. They should uniformly adopt the “Flying Eagle” brand of domestically produced raincloth, oilcloth, and other products, and increase import tariffs on foreign raincloth and similar items, to promote domestic industry.</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of promoting domestic industry, the Association has recently received a letter from Liang Shixiong, manager of the Lianpu Trading Co., Ltd. Waterproof Cloth Factory, stating, in brief, 'Our factory was established with capital raised by Chinese citizens. The "Flying Eagle" brand of military oilcloth, raincloth, and various other domestic raincloth, raincoat silk, and waterproof cloth items are all meticulously researched and manufactured by our factory manager, who serves as the technician. Moreover, the raw materials and base cloth are all purchased domestically. Our products are reliable and our reputation is solid. We have consistently received registration and awards from the Ministry of Military Affairs, the Ministry of Industry, and the Ministry of Finance, and have been thoroughly inspected by national goods organizations, which have recognized us as a genuine domestic manufacturer. However, our factory is not complacent and strives for continuous improvement in our products, sparing no effort. As a result, the quality of our products improves daily, and production is accelerating. We hope that after sales promotion, foreign goods on the market will disappear and be unable to be sold. Our domestically produced goods, with the promotion from above and below, should be able to spread quickly and be widely sold on the market. Recently, a small number of unscrupulous merchants, seeking only their own small profits and disregarding the public good of the Chinese people, have falsely claimed that imported foreign raincloth and oilcloth are domestically produced, requesting various</p>
<p>Military and Government Agencies</p>
<p>to inspect and adopt them. This prevents our genuine domestic goods from being sold. Obstructing the business of our domestic factories is a minor matter; what about the outflow of rights and interests? Upon comparing domestic and foreign raincloth and oilcloth, the obvious key points are: the width and dimensions of the base cloth. Domestic cloth, such as that from Yong'an, Shenxin, and the Suzhou Weaving Factory, is only 35 to 38 inches wide at most, while foreign cloth is as wide as 42 to 44 inches. This wide-width base cloth, if one wants to pass it off as domestic, is not only unavailable in all of Shanghai, but also no domestic cloth factory in our entire country has such wide looms to weave it. This is the first point. The selvage of domestic base cloth is invariably stamped with the trademark of the weaving factory, while foreign cloth is not. This is the second point. The cotton yarn used for domestic base cloth is all purchased by the cloth factory after the resident unified tax office personnel have issued unified tax permits. After weaving, a woven product transport permit must be exchanged with the unified tax permit before it can be transported and sold. As for foreign goods, there are no such unified tax permits or transport permits. This is the third point. Therefore, we</p>
<p>request your Association</p>
<p>to truthfully forward this to the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>earnestly requesting a thorough investigation</p>
<p>of the fraudulent behavior of the aforementioned unscrupulous merchants, and to take measures to ban the practice of passing off foreign goods as domestic. On the one hand, please notify all relevant agencies to uniformly adopt our factory's "Flying Eagle" brand of domestically produced raincloth, oilcloth, and other items to promote domestic industry. Our factory would be most fortunate, and the domestic goods industry would be most fortunate. Enclosed are samples of our trademarked products and grey cloth, which we hope will also be forwarded to demonstrate our public-spiritedness.' The Association also received trademarked samples. Based on this, we</p>
<p>find that the company is currently the only domestic waterproof cloth factory, with the "Flying Eagle" brand, which was approved and registered by the Ministry of Industry and the Trademark Bureau in August of the 24th year of the Republic of China. Its products include military raincloth, oilcloth, raincoat silk, and waterproof cloth, etc. Its raw materials are white grey cloth woven by Chinese-owned yarn factories such as Yong'an, Shenxin, and the Suzhou Weaving Factory, meticulously processed and manufactured to be truly completely domestic goods. However, the width of its goods is only 38 inches at most, not as wide as foreign goods, which can be up to 44 inches. At this time, when tax-evading private smuggling is rampant in North China, private goods from both domestic and foreign locations are arriving like a tide. Our domestic manufacturers are alarmed, fearing destruction. We urgently hope that the government will</p>
<p>strictly combat smuggling</p>
<p>and set an example by earnestly purchasing domestic goods to maintain the industry. If purchasing agents in various government agencies are careless and allow unscrupulous merchants to deceive them with clever words, they will easily be misled, defeating the purpose of promoting domestic goods by your esteemed Yuan. For the sake of thoroughly investigating the truth, the Association, after a resolution by the fourth executive committee meeting, specially dispatched an investigator who secretly investigated and confirmed that the aforementioned wide-width raincloth and other goods are indeed foreign goods. The only domestic raincloth factory is Lianpu Trading Company. At this time when the government is earnestly promoting domestic goods, the Association, having learned this, should offer its opinion. Therefore, we are submitting this petition with the facts, and enclosing samples of domestic and foreign raincloth, oilcloth, raw material grey cloth, trademark styles, and photographs of registration certificates. We humbly beseech your esteemed Yuan to investigate and approve, instructing all government agencies to thoroughly investigate merchants who obscurely pass off foreign goods as domestic goods, hindering the progress of domestic goods, and requesting that an order be issued to uniformly adopt the "Flying Eagle" brand of domestic raincloth and oilcloth. At the same time, please instruct the Ministry of Finance to increase import tariffs on foreign raincloth and similar items, thereby promoting domestic goods and maintaining the livelihoods of industry and commerce. We await your order with utmost urgency, and respectfully request your instructions for compliance. Respectfully submitted, Chiang, President of the Executive Yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e133">Thin Clothes and a Bulging Abdomen: Lin Huijuan Fully Reveals Her Hidden Affairs; Ma Zonglian and His Mother Accused of Enticement, Rape, and Abandonment; The District Court Scheduled to Investigate and Prosecute Tomorrow <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Lin Yan's wife, from Yin County, residing at No. 11 Jinghe Lane, Maojia Lane, in the South City, along with her daughter Lin Huijuan, 20 years old, hired lawyer Zhang Ding to file a complaint with the District Court against Ma Zonglian (also known as Ma Boyu), 21 years old, from Hangzhou, residing at No. 39 Yinxian Lane, Xundao Street, and his mother, Ma Qian's wife, for offenses including disruption of the family, abandonment, and instigation of abortion. The complaint stated, in brief, that Ms. Lin’s daughter Huijuan, given the nickname Aiju, was enticed into marriage by the first defendant on September 30th of last year, with a written statement promising never to abandon her and not to have relations with another member of the opposite sex. Trusting in this enticement, she was deceived on that very day and had her chastity violated at the Menggen Hotel. Later, on October 27th, the same statement was re-recorded on the back of a photograph to express sincerity, and it was jointly held as proof. Starting from December of the same year, on unspecified dates, she was repeatedly raped for eight nights at the Xiaoyao, Anshang, and Chunjiang Hotels. She became pregnant this year but did not dare to let her mother know. Recently, her clothes were thin and her abdomen bulged, and she was discovered. After repeated questioning, she could not hide it and had to fully confess. Since the matter had been exposed, the defendant turned to his mother, Ma Qian's wife, to invite Huijuan to their residence near the Guoxiangfeng Cigarette and Paper Shop on Xundao Street. They gave her musk powder and Liushen pills prepared in advance, instructing her to swallow them to induce an abortion. They promised to definitely welcome her as a daughter-in-law after the abortion, offering all sorts of comfort. At the time, with her life at stake, she did not comply. The defendants, mother and son, realizing that their wicked scheme had failed, discussed another marriage arrangement. Recently, they have become increasingly distant, showing a clear intention to abandon her. In their actions, Ma Zonglian committed the crime of disrupting the family under Article 240 of the Criminal Code, and also the crime of abandonment under Article 294. Ma Qian's wife committed the crime of instigating abortion under Article 291 of the Criminal Code. They request that the court order a strict prosecution, etc. The Procuratorate of the Court has now approved the case, and Inspector Kong has summoned them for investigation and prosecution at 2 PM on the 9th of this month.</p>

<p>The Shanghai National Goods Year National Goods Movement Association and the China National Products Manufacturers Joint Association, who jointly organized the Shanghai National Goods Movement Exhibition, have seen excellent results since its opening. Therefore, it has been decided to extend the exhibition for half a month. The association now plans to hold a lantern parade on the 15th of this month, to attract the attention of citizens. They have also sent a letter to the citizens' associations of the two special districts of the city, requesting that they lead their district branch members to visit the exhibition during the extended period. The original letter is recorded below: "Dear Sirs, Our association was founded only half a year ago, and has always been dedicated to promoting national goods and supporting the people's livelihood. In the past half year, in view of the rampant presence of foreign goods, the decline of domestic goods, and the enormous leakage of wealth, we are deeply alarmed. The habit of Chinese people of valuing foreign goods and despising domestic goods is becoming increasingly serious. Therefore, we have specifically held the Shanghai National Goods Movement Exhibition on Penglai Road in South Shanghai, to enable all citizens of the city to recognize national goods and develop a mentality of taking pride in using national goods. It has been two weeks since the opening, and the association believes that due to the rushed current situation, it is difficult to achieve significant results. In order to provide our citizens with the opportunity to visit as much as possible, we have specifically extended the exhibition for half a month beyond the three weeks. With a longer time, if all parties can repeatedly encourage and persuade, the results will be grand. We believe that your associations are the highest-level groups in the special districts of this city, and have always been enthusiastic about promoting the national goods movement. We dare to boldly write to your associations, requesting that during the extended period of the national goods exhibition organized by our association, you must forward this to your district branches, introducing them to members who are encouraged to visit. Our association will sincerely receive and guide them in understanding national goods, in order to achieve cooperative results. This would be the good fortune of our association and the blessing of the future of national goods. Respectfully addressed to the Shanghai First Special District Citizens Joint Association and the Shanghai Second Special District People's Joint Association."</p>

<p>The Tanziwan Police Station in Zhabei received a phone call at around 4 AM yesterday morning, reporting that a large number of robbers, about 20 or more, each armed with rifles, Mauser pistols, handguns, etc., and using several trucks, had robbed the Xie Feng Rice Shop at No. 489 Shuimenting Bridge (i.e., Pengpu New Bridge) on Hutai Road, taking all the shop's property and dozens of dan of white rice, etc. After receiving the report, the police station had officers lead the regular shift of police officers to make arrests. Because the number of robbers was large, and fearing that they would be outnumbered, they also called the Xinzha Branch Bureau. After receiving the report, Bureau Chief Liao Jiongxian also dispatched a large number of regular police officers and ordered Detectives Bao Ziying and Qian Tianxiong, along with team leaders Li Shouchang and Mao Gongzhao, and detectives Yang Yucai and Xiao Huaiyu, and a large number of detectives, to rush to the scene. They saw that the iron gate outside the rice shop was tightly closed, and the inner door was also properly closed. There was no sign of robbery. However, the main partners in the shop had all fled. Neighbors said that there had been no robbers. As for the rice in the shop, it was said that the shop's own trucks had been used to transport it to the countryside. It was then realized that it was a false report of robbery. The detectives returned to their bureaus and secretly dispatched detectives Yang Yucai and Xiao Huaiyu to lie in ambush near the shop to observe any movements inside. At around 6 AM, a person resembling an apprentice was seen lingering at the entrance of the rice shop. Detectives Yang and Xiao approached and apprehended him. He said his name was Li Jinxian, 20 years old, from Songjiang, and he was a partner in the rice shop. He said that the shop owner, Li Shusheng, had embezzled money. Yesterday (i.e., the 6th) afternoon, at around 4 PM, [Li Shusheng] told me to deliver a note to the back door of the Yong'an Company on Er Ma Road, and give it to shareholder Song Lansheng. I waited for about an hour but did not see Song Lansheng arrive. Moreover, when Li gave me the note, he also told me not to return to the shop at night, so I went to stay overnight at my aunt's house at the Wang Dachang Incense Shop nearby. This morning, I returned to the shop and saw that the situation inside was not right, and that fifty or sixty dan of white rice were missing. So I was observing from outside. Song Lansheng is about 30 years old this year, and is from Jiading. Li Shusheng is about 25 or 26 years old, and is from Dachang. I don't know where they are now. I didn't return to the shop last night, so I don't know about the police report, etc. After receiving the report, detectives Yang and Xiao took Li Jinxian into custody. They are now sending for Li Shusheng and Song Lansheng to be brought to the case for questioning.</p>

<h3 id="e149">Two "Red Pill" Offenders Detained Awaiting Sentence <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Chinese detective Jin Wanrong from the Yulin Road Police Station apprehended Wang Fucheng, a native of Tongzhou, who was selling the drug "red pills" at Huasheng Road at about 10 PM the night before last. Ninety-six pills were found on his person. He confessed that he had purchased them from a thatched house on Huade Road for 1 yuan. The police then secretly went to the address and arrested the assistant offender Wang Chujiu of Nanjing after being informed, as the principal offender Zhang Mazi had already fled. They took a total of Wang Ganxiang, Xi Xiaodi, Tang Gengen, and Wang Chujiu. They were also brought into the police station along with drug paraphernalia. One night ago, he was sent to the Second Criminal Chamber of the First Special Court. The judge, Jiang Shuzhi, interrogated each of the defendants and ordered their continued detention to await sentencing.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Hua Haiyang Company: Appeal for Return of Lace Samples <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The Dutch merchant Hua Haiyang Company had previously ordered a large quantity of lace from the Xiehe Lace Company on Jingyuan Street, Guangdong Road. A dispute arose over payment for the goods. Zhu Dexin, from the lace company, hired attorney Yue Junying to accuse the foreign manager of the Hua Haiyang Company, the Austrian Mei Pisi, of colluding with Hua Jing, whom he had never met, to deduct the payment, and attempting to renege on the samples, etc., at the First Special District Local Court. The first instance judgment ordered the two defendants to jointly and severally repay the outstanding payment and return 191 pieces of hemp lace. However, the plaintiff's request for the return of 53 samples was rejected. They were unwilling to accept this and hired attorney Yue to file an appeal, stating that it is customary in the lace industry for goods to be received and delivered based on credit. Therefore, the samples held by the appellee were all marked and numbered so that foreign merchants could select them according to the numbers. After the payment was deducted, the appellee refused to return the samples, except for those that had already been retrieved. As these samples of Feili brand are of many colors and patterns, foreign orders depend entirely on the samples. Without the samples, the lace business would be suspended. At the time, in order to be accommodating, the company temporarily agreed to leave the samples in storage. It was not known that they intended to attempt to default. During the first trial, they even presented the appellant's receipt, claiming that they had been returned on January 7. However, the receipt clearly stated that the goods of Feili were returned, not that the samples were being returned. The original trial did not investigate thoroughly and rejected this part, which is difficult to accept. Moreover, after the return of the goods, repeated requests were made for the return of the samples, and the appellee's reply did not deny it, which is sufficient to prove that the samples had not actually been returned. Therefore, they requested a judgment ordering their return, and bearing the costs of litigation for both trials. The other day, the Civil Court of the Second Branch of the High Court summoned both parties and Zhang Tingrong and Zhang Lingsheng, who were present to witness the return of the goods, to appear in court for review. They ordered that the case be adjourned for further review.</p>

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>I have seen in your newspaper the case of Li Guojie, the former General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, stating that the court, in order to restrict his residence, had Jiang Yiping, a lawyer, and Fuchang Ginseng Company, etc., act as guarantors according to the law. After investigation, our company has not acted as a guarantor for Li Guojie. It seems that your newspaper's inquiry was inaccurate. Please correct this.</p>

<h3 id="e162">World Games Preliminaries and Sino-Western Confrontation - Seven National Records Broken <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Three Track Events, Four Field Events, Plus Two Western Events - Only One Women's Event - Ten Events Continued Today</p>
<p>The World Games Track and Field Team Selection Competition was held at the Shen Garden yesterday afternoon. At the same time, a Sino-Western track and field confrontation was held to increase competitive interest. The elite of the country's track and field gathered to compete with the Shanghai Western expatriate athletes. Therefore, yesterday's situation and excitement were exceptionally enthusiastic. The audience reached four to five thousand people, and Mayor Wu also attended the event. Although the track and field finals were not as good as ideal, a total of seven national records were broken. In addition, the national records for the 400 meters and javelin were broken by Western athletes. The women's performance only held one item, the 100 meters, with Li Sen equaling the national record at 13.2 seconds. In addition to track and field, ten sports tests were added, with three participants. It will only be possible to complete the test this afternoon. Among the results, Jia Lianren's 1500 meters and Wang Shilin's triple jump were the most impressive. Liu Changchun's loss to Bowen in the 200 meters and Fu Baolu's departure from the field were the most disappointing. The results and situation are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Seven New Records <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Jia Lianren's 1500 Meters is Creditable - Huang Yingjie Overwhelms Lin Shaozhou in High Hurdles - Zhou Changxing and Guo Jie Unsuccessful</p>
<p>Yesterday, a total of seven new national records were set. In addition, the records for the 400 meters and javelin were broken by British soldier Bowen and Russian Kaczan. Among them, Jia Lianren's 1500 meters in 4 minutes and 11.1 seconds and Huang Yingjie's 15.7 seconds in the high hurdles, overwhelming Lin Shaozhou, were valuable gains. Zhou Changxing, who had a javelin of 53.85 meters, and Guo Jie, who had a discus of 41.13 meters, were both unsuccessful. Wang Shilin's triple jump was also not weak. Chen Baoqiu's long jump was far from the record he set in Beiping. The high jump and middle hurdles were also barely satisfactory. The seven new records are recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Discus - The first field event to end was the discus. With Guo Jie's rapid progress in the training class in Beiping, excellent results were expected. Unexpectedly, he repeatedly failed to achieve success. Leng Genpei, who lived in Shanghai, threw beyond 39 meters, overwhelming Guo Jie. Although both of their results broke Leng's national record of 37.85 meters, it was still far from Guo Jie's new record of 41.13 meters in Beiping. Named results are as follows:</p>
<p>Leng Peigen (China) 39.07</p>
<p>Guo Jie (China) 38.01</p>
<p>Kaczan (West) 37.49</p>
<p>Parker (West) 37.40</p>
<p>Shot Put - Five people participated. In the first throw, Chen Baoqiu got 12.88 meters, breaking his own national record of 12.69 meters, leading the group. Prokofiev also followed Chen with 12.61 meters. In the third throw, Pu got 12.66 meters. In the fifth throw, Kaczan made great progress, getting 12.58 meters. Parker also rose from fifth to fourth with 12.22 meters. Liu Furun's throw was invalidated due to stepping out of bounds after getting 12.13 meters in the second throw, and he was eliminated in fifth place. Chen's results were still far from the training class.</p>
<p>Chen Baoqiu (China) 12.88</p>
<p>Prokofiev (West) 12.66</p>
<p>Kaczan (West) 12.58</p>
<p>Parker (West) 12.22</p>
<p>Javelin - Ten people participated in the competition. Our country's veterans Hao Chunde and Peng Yongxin, and the emerging star Zhou Changxing, all attended the battle. Unexpectedly, the three generals Peng, Hao, and Zhou were completely helpless. In the first throw, Nixon got more than 50 meters, Zhou got 48.31 meters, and Peng was close to 45 meters. After three throws, only Hao Chunde, Zhou Changxing, Wang Xuewu, Kaczan, and Nixon remained. Each throw progressed, and Kaczan surpassed Ni in the fifth attempt with 51.65 meters, surpassing our country's record. Hao also got 50.33 meters in the last attempt. Zhou never made progress and got fourth place.</p>
<p>Kaczan (West) 51.65</p>
<p>Nixon (West) 51.11</p>
<p>Hao Chunde (China) 50.33</p>
<p>Zhou Changxing (China) 48.30</p>
<p>Triple Jump - There is a lot of talent in the triple jump. It is expected that the competition will be fierce. Situ Guang was the one who won one of the most valuable points for our country in the Far Eastern Games. Wang Shilin also has great skills in the training class. As expected, he got 14 meters when he debuted yesterday. Situ's first jump was only 13.87 meters. Zhang Jiakui was also not in good shape. The Japanese Ojiubo got 13.34 meters in the first jump. There was no progress in the third jump. Only Situ Guang improved to 14.03 meters. In the last jump, Wang Shilin got 14.36 meters, breaking Situ Guang's 14.192 meters. The Russian general actually came from behind at this time, rising to second place with 14.06 meters. Situ Guang and Zhang ranked third and fourth respectively.</p>
<p>Wang Shilin (China) 14.36</p>
<p>Prokofiev (West) 14.06</p>

<p>High Jump - Before the competition, Wu had the ambition to approach 1.90 meters. Liu Mengjiu's results have also improved recently. The final competition between the two was quite fierce. Liu Mengjiu jumped over 1.81 meters. At 1.825 meters, Liu failed to jump over it in three attempts. Wu Bixian also jumped over 1.85 meters, breaking the national record. He increased it to 1.875 meters, but failed due to insufficient strength.</p>
<p>Wu Bixian (China) 1.85</p>
<p>Liu Mengjiu (China) 1.81</p>
<p>Zhou Shizhao (China) 1.785</p>
<p>Prokofiev (West) 1.785</p>
<p>High Hurdles - The result of the high hurdles final was unexpected. Huang Yingjie actually overwhelmed Lin Shaozhou to win the championship. The result was 15.7 seconds, breaking the national record. Lin was only one chest behind. After the start, Lin led all the way. In the last 10 meters before the seventh hurdle, Huang Yingjie caught up from behind. In the final sprint, Huang won the first place with the force of his chest. The third was Bei Lei, and the fourth was Keping, both Westerners. Huang fell twice, and Lin fell only once.</p>
<p>Middle Hurdles - Although Cheng Jinguan's hurdle jumping technique is not refined and his posture is not high, he won the first place in the middle hurdles with his short-distance speed. With 58.3 seconds, he broke the national record. Li Shiming wanted to try the middle hurdles because he saw little hope in the middle distance. As a result, he was defeated by Jinguan. Li Houda, a veteran general, was third, and Liao Jinhai was fourth. With this speed, Jinguan should improve his hurdle jumping technique, and he will hopefully have a chance.</p>
<p>1500 Meters - In the 1500 meters final, Jia Lianren broke the national record with 4 minutes and 11.1 seconds, which was one of the most impressive events of yesterday's track and field. He threw away the sixth-ranked Gu Fulda by more than 60 meters. The third was Ling Xuewen, and the fourth was Klogov. Only Mai and Ling participated in the World Games preliminaries. Westerners won three. After the start, Jia took the lead at 50 meters and led all the way to the end. His posture and footwork were excellent. It is a pity that he still lacked speed in the final 200 meters. Otherwise, his results would have been even more impressive.</p>
<p>400 Meters - Liu Changchun was defeated by Bowen in the 200 meters. In the 400 meters, Bowen exerted his authority again, overwhelming Dai Shuguo. Bowen's result was 50.2 seconds, which is rare in the country. Dai was 52.7 seconds, which was inferior to his national record of 51.6 seconds. He was five or six meters away from Bowen when he reached the finish line. Dong Shuzhao was third, and Li Yanxiang was fourth, which shows Bowen's strength. The point of Bowen's strength is that he has long legs and wide steps. It is also a surprise that there are such monsters among Westerners.</p>

<p>Jia Lianren, who has repeatedly updated his national records in the middle distance, will stay in Germany to study sports after participating in the World Games this time, with a view to returning to China in three years.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Miscellaneous Notes on the Sino-Foreign Track and Field Competition <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>The Sino-Foreign competition, doubling as the national preliminary for the World Games track and field events, was held yesterday at the Shanghai Recreation Ground (申園). Because the Beijing training camp produced many new national and Far Eastern records, the people of Shanghai were captivated, with four to five thousand people visiting the recreation ground yesterday. There was also the McLeay military band and a phonograph, creating a very enthusiastic atmosphere, and people gradually dispersed only after the program was completed. However, some events that were expected to have good results were unexpectedly won by foreigners, which was a slight disappointment.</p>
<p>In the opening event, the 100 meters, Liu Changchun did not participate. The focus was on Chuan Jincheng and Cheng Jinguan. Due to false starts and the starting gun malfunctioning, multiple unsuccessful starts occurred before the race finally began on the fifth attempt. Chuan Jincheng won first place with a time of 10.9 seconds. He has plenty of strength and a good physique, but his sprint is weak, and his posture is not graceful.</p>
<p>The women's 100 meters was the only women's event yesterday, with only two participants: a blonde-haired woman, Meling Novska, and a Chinese athlete. At first, no one could tell who she was, but halfway through the race, it was recognized as the famous Miss Li Sen, number 111. Her momentum was quite impressive, leaving the Western woman more than 20 yards behind, and her time of 13.2 seconds equaled the national record. From then on, she dominated all the highest records in the women's triple race.</p>
<p>The first national record broken was in the 2:35 high hurdles, with an unexpected "upset." Huang Yingjie had never beaten Lin Shaozhou, but who would have thought that he would defeat Lin Shaozhou (the national record holder) with 15.7 seconds and set a new record? In the first six hurdles, Lin took the lead, and even at the last hurdle, he was on the balance line. Until the finish line, Huang's chest crossed Lin Shaozhou, securing first place. It seems that Lin's skill is also within the 16-second mark.</p>
<p>Bowen from the British army was very impressive, overshadowing both Liu Changchun and Dai Shukuo. In the 200 meters, Liu false-started by a step, and in the last 100 meters, Liu's steps seemed heavy. Bowen gradually took the lead, leaving Liu far behind, but his time of 22.7 seconds was only average. In the 400 meters, Bowen again showed his prowess. Although Dai Shukuo was also not bad, Bowen only took 50.2 seconds, far beyond what Dai could achieve. If our country's athletes had achieved this result, it would have been satisfactory.</p>
<p>In the discus and javelin, our country's athletes suffered unexpected defeats. Peng Yongxin and Zhou Changxing originally had skills exceeding 50 meters, but unexpectedly, Lao Peng failed twice and withdrew. Zhou only scored 48.31 meters. Old Hao (Chunde) still showed his strength, achieving 50.33 meters to get third place. The first and second places were both Westerners. Guo Jie once had a throw of 3.13 feet in the discus, and it was thought he would surely win the championship, but unexpectedly Leng Peigen, residing in Shanghai, beat Guo Jie with 39.07 meters, while Guo's was 38.01 meters. Although both were new national records, it cannot be considered satisfactory.</p>
<p>In the long jump, Wang Shilin once had an excellent result of 7.03 meters, but yesterday he only achieved 6.64 meters, getting third place. Ye Suian, the champion of the National Games, achieved 6.57 meters, a great disappointment. Zhang Jiakui won the championship with an ordinary score of 6.78 meters. The pole vault was the most interesting competition but was also very disappointing. Fu Baolu only tried once and stopped due to abdominal pain. Wang He once had a national record of 3.92 meters. In the competition against Abramov at the 3.48-meter mark, there was intense competition. Both barely managed to jump over it, but when deciding the ranking, Wang He only got second place.</p>
<p>The most satisfying were Jia Lianren's 1500 meters and Wang Shilin's triple jump, both of which had new records set. Jia had previously run 4 minutes and 13 seconds, but yesterday he shortened it by nearly two seconds. Wang's triple jump of 14.36 meters was also very commendable. Situ Guang made a comeback and was still able to maintain a skill above 14 meters, which is truly not easy. Jia's 800 meters time of 2 minutes and 3.6 seconds was far from the 2 minutes and 0.3 seconds he achieved in the competition against Tianjin.</p>
<p>In the shot put, Chen Baoqiu scored 12.88 meters, which is also a national record, but not his best performance. Liu Furun once had 12.95 meters in the competition against Tianjin, but yesterday he didn't even place, getting fifth with 12.13 meters. Wu Bixian's high jump of 1.85 meters was not bad. He failed three attempts at 1.875 meters.</p>
<p>The 400-meter hurdles was truly an "upset," with no satisfactory talent emerging. Cheng Yuguan took a chance and broke the national record with 58.3 seconds. However, his posture of hooking his back foot under his buttocks while clearing the hurdle still remains unchanged. If he attends the World Games, will foreigners laugh at China for not having a coach?</p>
<p>The 10,000 meters was dull because the old man from Shanxi did not come to Shanghai. Liu Changchun also did not participate in the two relay races. With such a well-organized lineup, no good results were achieved, which was very disappointing. The baton exchange was too untrained. It not only failed to save time but also delayed it. The American relay teams often do not consist of formal competitors, yet their results repeatedly set new world records. The art of baton exchange is truly too scientific.</p>
<p>Yesterday, in addition to the formal program, there was a sudden impromptu decathlon test, with Zhou Changxing, Cheng Mengping, and Zhang Lingjia participating. Is it necessary for our country's decathlon performance to also attend the World Games? The saying "talent as the standard" is difficult to explain.</p>
<p>Overall, yesterday's results were generally not bad. There were unexpected gains and unexpected failures. What kind of perspective will the selection committee use for selection? Sending twelve track and field athletes is not a small number. Sending more athletes is not necessarily a meritorious deed. It seems more practical to hire a few foreign coaches to guide them. China is not lacking in sports talent!</p>

<h3 id="e166">Liu Changchun's Decline <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Defeated by Bowen in the 200 meters, his performance was mediocre.</p>
<p>Liu Changchun, our country's first and only sprinter to attend the World Games, did not show his face in the Beijing training camp due to a leg injury. Yesterday, he only participated in the 200 meters event, unexpectedly being defeated by the British soldier Bowen, whose time was 22.7 seconds, which was quite average. Liu was about four or five yards behind, estimated to be above 23 seconds. Observing his steps in the last 100 meters, they were quite heavy. His leg injury should be taken seriously, and the lack of practice has contributed to this. Fu Baolu only tried once in the pole vault and gave up due to abdominal pain, which was very disappointing. It is regrettable that Jia Lianren failed to set a new record in the 800 meters. Wang Shilin was also unsuccessful in the long jump. The other results were mediocre.</p>
<p>The long jump performance was mediocre, and the expectation of a new record became a bubble. The results of the top four are as follows:</p>
<p>Zhang Jiakui (China) 6.78</p>
<p>Okubo (West) 6.67</p>
<p>Wang Shilin (China) 6.64</p>
<p>Ye Suian (China) 6.57</p>
<p>Wang Shilin, who previously set a new national record of 7.01 meters, had no good performance after achieving 6.64 meters on his second attempt.</p>
<p>800 meters: The 800-meter final was highly anticipated by the crowd due to Jia Lianren's presence. Jia had achieved a time of 2 minutes and 0.3 seconds in Beijing, so there was hope that he could break into the 2-minute mark. Unfortunately, he arrived from Jinan late last night and did not have enough rest, so although the championship was not in question, his time was only 2 minutes and 3.6 seconds. In the first 300 meters, Jia's speed was very average, and he only increased his pace after 300 meters. Reaching the finish line, he could only equal the record. Li Shiming and the Westerner Aflei competed fiercely, with Li only finishing second by a shoulder, about thirty or more meters behind Jia. Zhao Miaogen was fourth.</p>
<p>100 meters: The men's 100-meter final was the opening act, with three participants from both China and the West. The Chinese were Chuan Yucheng, Cheng Jinguan, and Zhao Bingheng. Liu Changchun rested for the 100 meters to fully focus on the 200 meters. The Westerners were all mediocre. After the gun was fired and recalled, they finally started. Chuan Jincheng took the lead, with a very fast start. Behind Chuan was Cheng, followed by Zhao and the three Westerners. After 50 meters, Cheng Jinguan's speed increased sharply, charging forward, almost alongside Chuan. It was a very dangerous situation, but upon reaching the finish line, Cheng was second by a chest. Chuan's time was 10.9 seconds, which was better than usual. Zhao Bingheng was third, and the Englishman Bellay was fourth.</p>
<p>200 meters: Liu Changchun put all his efforts into the 200-meter final. Liu only attended the first test in Beijing, achieving 22.9 seconds, and then retired for rest. His recent strength was therefore of great interest. However, the result yesterday was that he was defeated by the British soldier Bowen. Bowen's time was 22.7 seconds, and Liu was about three meters behind, around 23 seconds. The failure of Liu's 200 meters, which was a sure thing, in the domestic first competition was quite surprising to the three thousand spectators. Bowen was in the innermost lane, and Liu was in the middle. After turning at the 100-meter mark, Bowen emerged, overtaking Liu after 150 meters and sprinting to the end. Third was Sidney Qinggu, and fourth was Stettou. Bowen was unmatched in height, with large and fast strides, making Liu no match for him.</p>
<p>10,000 meters: The 10,000 meters was one of the least interesting events yesterday. The Shanxi athletes were only seen by name and not in person. There were five participants, and only three finished the entire course to the end. The first was Wang Zhenglin, the second was the Japanese Murakami, and the third was Zhang Liang. The results were mediocre, 35 minutes and 16.6 seconds. Murakami was 150 meters behind Wang, and Zhang Liang was 300 meters behind Wang.</p>
<p>Two Relay Races: The closing acts, the 400-meter relay and the 1600-meter relay, were both won by the Chinese team. Although both teams were made up of star players, the results were mediocre and unexciting due to the lack of baton exchange skills. The 400 meters was 45.8 seconds. The order of the runners was as follows: first leg Zhao Bingheng, second leg Cheng Jinguan, third leg Huang Yingjie, and final leg Chuan Jincheng. It can be said that the baton exchange between Cheng and Huang was the most disjointed. The 1600 meters was 3 minutes and 38.6 seconds. The order of the runners was as follows: first leg Dong Shuzhao, second leg Li Yanxiang, third leg Jia Lianren, and final leg Dai Shukuo. Neither broke the record. The Englishman Bowen and Liu Changchun did not participate.</p>
<p>Pole Vault: Fu Baolu only tried once and gave up due to abdominal pain. Only Wang He and Abramov competed, greatly reducing the interest. The two struggled for a long time, barely clearing 3.48 meters, tying for first place. In the deciding round, Wang He fell behind.</p>

<p>A total of nine female athletes from the Chinese team registered, but none of them participated. Only Li Sen attended. Only Meling Novska participated from the Western team, so all the other competitions were announced to be canceled. Only Li and Mei performed a 100-meter exhibition race. It started at 2:30. As soon as the starting gun fired, Li Sen sprinted forward, and Mei Ling could not keep up. After 50 meters, she was already two meters behind. Li made a final effort to sprint, reaching the finish line, leaving Mei Ling about three meters behind. The time was 13.2 seconds, equaling the national record of Jiao Yulian and Zhang Jieqiong.</p>

<p>Our country's race walking athletes for the World Games were tested a few days ago, and a total of four completed the entire course. The results were all not bad. The authorities decided to send two as official representatives. The Chinese Race Walking Association, in order to promote talent, specifically raised funds to select two more, totaling four. The funding shortfall is not much, only about eight hundred yuan. It is hoped that enthusiastic people will generously donate to raise these funds. The results are quite good. It is said that a certain gentleman alone donated as much as 1,500 yuan.</p>

<p>Only the 100-meter breaststroke was tested yesterday, with a time of 3 minutes and 13.6 seconds, a decline compared to before.</p>
<p>Guo Zhenheng, a famous breaststroke swimmer, underwent a test by the World Games Swimming Association yesterday at 11 a.m. at the Municipal Swimming Pool for reference in selecting swimming representatives for the World Games. Ling Xitao was commissioned by the Sports Association as the referee, Wang Fudan gave the starting signal, and Li Jiyuan and Xu Heng kept time. Mr. John Maas also attended to supervise the test. Yesterday, the water temperature in the Municipal Swimming Pool was 76 degrees. After preparations were completed, Guo entered the water accompanied by Zhong Shoujun and Wu Gansheng, breaststroke experts from the Guangdong team. Only the 100-meter breaststroke was tested. The result was 3 minutes and 13.6 seconds, a decline in performance.</p>

<p>— The Municipal Boy Scouts Held a Grand Review Yesterday Morning, Practiced Emergency Drills in the Afternoon, and Held a Bonfire Party for Entertainment in the Evening</p>
<p>The boy scouts from various primary and secondary schools and social organizations in the city set off from their original locations on the 6th, advancing towards the city center. After arriving, they set up camps and pitched tents. The administrative area was transformed into a military area. A grand review was held in the stadium yesterday morning, and an emergency period performance was given in the afternoon, suddenly changing the atmosphere and creating an unusually tense atmosphere. There was a bonfire party in the evening for entertainment. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Camp Inspection: The total number of young children participating in this event reached over seven thousand. The camping area in front of the Municipal Government lasted for three days and nights. The camping area was green with grass, and the tents were scattered like stars. Banners and flags fluttered, bright and dazzling. Bugles sounded from time to time, and the sound of drums created a solemn atmosphere, resembling a battle array.</p>
<p>Review Ceremony: The grand review was held at the Municipal Stadium yesterday at 9 a.m. The chairman, vice-chairman, reviewing officers, all general meeting officials, and Chinese and foreign guests were seated on the western command platform. After the boy scouts being reviewed entered, cannons were fired and flags were raised. First, the chairman and vice-chairman gave instructions, and then the review began. After the review, there was cheering, and the ceremony ended. The reviewed teams withdrew from the venue in an orderly manner, with strict discipline, a good order, and better results than in the past.</p>
<p>Number of Participants: Those who participated in the review ceremony included Chairman Wu Tiecheng, Vice-Chairmen Tong Hangbai and Pan Gongzhan, Municipal Public Security Bureau Director Cai Jingjun, Municipal Council Speaker Wang Xiaolai, US Commercial Counselor Arnold, Municipal Government Secretaries Zhang Tingrong and Tang Shihuang, Municipal Stadium Director Shao Rugan, and the general meeting's officials Leng Xueqiao, Shen Yu, Xi Yutong, and Xia Huanxin, as well as more than 10,000 boy scouts from the city.</p>
<p>Assembly and Entry: At 8 a.m., the boy scouts separately assembled in front of each camp and marched to the stadium. By 9 a.m., the teams had assembled outside the stadium. The general commander Sun Yixin issued an order to advance, and each team and troop entered the venue in four columns, following the track in a large circle. The military band led the way, and each team was led by a dark green team flag, which looked like a yellowish-brown wreath from afar.</p>
<p>Airplane Circling: At 9 a.m. on this day, the Shanghai Boy Scouts airplane circled low over the city center and around the stadium, and then ascended directly into the sky, continuing to perform various maneuvers for 15 minutes before flying away. Around 11 a.m., when the cheering ceremony was over, it flew back, circling several times and performing various maneuvers before leaving.</p>
<p>Firing Cannons and Raising Flags: After the teams were lined up in the venue, the meeting was announced to begin. First, firecrackers were set off, and then the flag-raising ceremony was held. While singing the flag-raising song, General Commander Sun Yixin issued the order to stand at attention, and all the boy scouts stood at attention and performed the baton salute. The team leaders and coaches performed the hand salute, and the team flag bearers tilted the team flags forward by 30 degrees.</p>

<p>Chairman's Report: After the ceremony, Chairman Wu Tiecheng gave an opening speech, which read: "All boy scouts, directors, distinguished guests, and boy scouts: Today is the opening ceremony of the Shanghai Boy Scouts Seventh General Assembly. We have 15,000 boy scouts in Shanghai, and those who participated today account for half of them. The number of participants in this event is unprecedented in the history of Shanghai Boy Scout General Assemblies. The organization of the team is also unprecedented. With so many people participating, yet so orderly and full of energy, the citizens of Shanghai see that, I believe they are not only happy and delighted, but also that they have an even greater belief in the future of China. What is this greater belief? It is that they believe that there is hope for the future of China. Our China has now reached a very dangerous juncture, and the Chinese nation is now suffering a great threat. Therefore, we must now seek survival, and the basic task of seeking survival is to build a nation. What kind of nation should we build? We must build a nation of the Three Principles of the People. Building a nation depends on the people. We must have good citizens in order to build a good nation. Only a good nation can be strong, and only a strong nation can survive. But how can we be good citizens? We must be able to 'cultivate oneself, manage one's family, govern the country, and bring peace to the world.' Cultivating oneself, managing one's family, governing the country, and bringing peace to the world is the highest political philosophy in China. If each of us can do 'cultivate oneself, manage one's family, govern the country, and bring peace to the world,' we can be considered good citizens. Good citizens can build a good nation, and a good nation can seek survival. But how can we train each citizen so that they can do 'cultivate oneself, manage one's family, govern the country, and bring peace to the world?' We must start training from children. Children are the future masters of China. Today we train children, and we are training the future masters of China. The future masters of China will bear the great responsibility of revitalizing the Chinese nation. The best way to train children is through Boy Scout education, because the organization and training of Boy Scouts are the best methods for training children. Since the children of China today are the future masters of China, the purpose of the Chinese Boy Scouts is to 'develop children's ability to do things, cultivate good habits, so that they are noble in character, rich in common sense, and healthy in body, becoming youths with both wisdom, benevolence, and courage, to build a nation of the Three Principles of the People, and to achieve world harmony.' We also take China's inherent virtues, loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, and peace, as the highest principles of training Boy Scouts, so it can be said that Boy Scout training is instructing us on the principles of being and doing, which is also our highest ideal. We hope that the children of China today will use Boy Scout training as a guideline for our future actions, and Boy Scout training as our highest and purest ideal. Therefore, today we hold the opening ceremony of the Shanghai Boy Scouts Seventh General Assembly. We not only want to review the achievements of all the Boy Scouts in Shanghai, but also want to awaken Shanghai society and the parents of Shanghai to know the meaning of the Boy Scouts, and to dedicate their children to the country and society, to receive Boy Scout training, to promote Boy Scout training and movements. We hope that after this year's review, when we hold another review next year, the results will be better than this year. We cannot but hope that our Shanghai Boy Scouts will abide by the Boy Scout rules and oaths, strive to be good Boy Scouts, and prepare to be good citizens in the future, to take on the great responsibility of revitalizing the Chinese nation."</p>
<p>Start of the Review: After the chairman's report, the review began. Chairman Wu Tiecheng, along with all the reviewing officers, went down to the west command platform and to the center of the venue, inspecting the teams along the way. When the reviewing personnel went down, the general commander issued an order to stand at attention. When the reviewing personnel passed each team, the team leader issued an order to salute. The Boy Scouts performed the baton salute, the team leader performed the hand salute, and the team flag was tilted forward by 30 degrees. Everyone watched until the reviewing personnel had passed, and then the team leader issued an order to end the salute. After the reviewing personnel had inspected the area for a week, they returned to the command platform and continued to perform basic movements. The general commander issued the orders: Stand at attention, Right dress, Eyes front, Right face, About face, Left face, About face, Shoulder arms, Order arms, At ease. Finally, it was the marching style. The general commander issued the orders: Stand at attention, Right face, Shoulder arms, Forward, march. The military music began to play, marching around the track. Each team passed in front of the command platform, and the team leader issued an order to Eyes right. The Boy Scouts looked to the right, passing with a parade step, until the last row had passed the command platform, and then issued the Eyes front order. The steps were very orderly, and the reviewing officers applauded to welcome them. The entire group circled the venue once and lined up in front of the command platform, standing in formation.</p>
<p>Instructions from Tong and Pan: After the review, Tong Hangbai gave instructions, briefly mentioning that the annual Boy Scout review is being held here today. The number of participants this time is greater than in previous years, and the curriculum has also increased compared to previous years. This cannot but be said to be a significant improvement. For example, in the curriculum, there is this time an emergency period exercise and labor service. The former is for the sake of the country, and the latter is for the sake of society. In other words, the Boy Scout community today has a further understanding of the country and society, but in the future, we should also pay attention to the advancement of technology, in order to achieve the purpose of perfection. Then Pan Gongzhan gave instructions, briefly saying that he is responsible for education in this city, and is very pleased to see that all the Boy Scouts are energetic and in good order today. As for Boy Scout training, attention should be paid to three aspects: Brain training, that is, to enable each person to fully use their brains, increase their knowledge, and be able to distinguish right from wrong; Heart training, that is, to cultivate in each person the concepts of "brightness," "conscience," "universal love," and "benevolence and righteousness"; Hand training, that is, to do a good deed every day. In this way, one can conform to the three virtues of "wisdom," "benevolence," and "courage."</p>
<p>Singing and Welcoming: After the instructions, everyone sang the Boy Scout song, and then everyone shouted "Move, move, move, Alert, alert, alert, Shanghai Boy Scouts, Boy Scouts, Strive forward, Revitalizing China is our responsibility, Boom, boom, boom, Clang, clang, clang, Chinese Boy Scouts, Boy Scouts, Long live." Then the ceremony ended.</p>
<p>Emergency Exercises: Starting at 1:30 p.m., the emergency exercises began. The general headquarters was set up on the west command platform of the Municipal Stadium, with a large flag hanging to identify it. At 1:30 p.m., the general headquarters issued a general alarm using the sound system. Everyone made preparations. At 2:00 p.m., enemy aircraft were detected entering the front line, so the second alarm was issued, and each group departed for activities. The exercises were divided into the communications group, commanded by Gong Jingzeng; the transportation group, commanded by Xu Guozhi; the anti-poisoning group, commanded by Za Lie; the engineering group, commanded by Sun Yiming; the rescue group, commanded by Xie Yanbo; the relief group, commanded by Sun Yixin; and the fire-fighting group, commanded by Shen Yu. It was not completed until 5:00 p.m.</p>

<p>— (Shi Gandang)</p>
<p>As foreign aggression intensifies and national crises deepen, a certain bookstore publishes books like "A Hundred Days to Master X Language" and "Basic X Language," even going so far as to advertise them extensively, saying: "Literate compatriots, hurry and learn X Language. The greater purpose is to serve the nation (?) and protect the family, and the smaller purpose is to make a name for yourself..." If everyone holds this view, it would be unreasonable for China not to perish.</p>
<p>I remember a certain teacher at an X school saying: Instead of students striving to pursue women, they should bury themselves in hard work. Once they become famous, they won't need to pursue the women; the women will come seeking them. I think everything is like this. Instead of seeking help from others, it's better to make others seek help from you, but the difficulty lies in how to make others seek help from you.</p>
<p>An old woman at home went to a temple to burn incense and fell! She broke her hand, but blamed herself for somehow offending the Bodhisattva, leading to this misfortune. Hearing this, I felt both amused and pitying.</p>
<p>When you are about to do something to someone, you must first put yourself in the other person's position and think about it. For example, when you are unhappy, you arbitrarily scold servants, but if you put yourself in the servant's position, can you endure being scolded for no reason? In this way, the anger in your heart will immediately dissipate. I often use this method to curb momentary anger.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Early Summer, in the Style of a Young Woman <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Xian</p>
<p>Summer is a gradually maturing young woman. Although not as seductive as a girl in early spring, it resembles a mature young woman, displaying the fullness of muscles and lines, no longer containing full childishness.</p>
<p>Indeed, early summer can be described as a girl nearing twenty, inherently pregnant with a kind of great fervor and strength.</p>
<p>In the uncertain atmosphere of a spring filled with sunshine and shade, I was huddled in a pigeon cage-like room. By chance, and quite suddenly, in the bright sunlight of an early summer day, I walked to the suburbs, which was truly beyond expectations. Green grass covered the ugly mud, as if covered with a blanket. Looking at it, it seemed completely inelastic, like a soft quilt.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the sunlight also seemed to emit a different kind of brilliance than what I saw two months ago. When it shone on my body, I felt that my thin jacket was already a bit too thick.</p>
<p>A few faded peach blossoms still lingered on the peach branches, but plum fruits as large as longans had already grown on the plum branches. The willow branches were also wrapped in a layer of green clothing, extending out from the corner of the fence outside the village, brushing against the brims of pedestrians' hats, so gentle, so affectionate, so captivating and memorable.</p>
<p>On the surface of the quiet little pond, large and small, round duckweeds floated, seeming to cover the pond surface with a quilt printed with patterns designed by artists, rich in artistic meaning. The grass on the banks of the pond seemed to be contending with the duckweed, vying to see who was a more vivid and verdant green. However, a few wild rose bushes by the stone steps trembled with a few round, carmine flowers, constantly nodding to the green grass and the green duckweed, as if smiling. Although the surroundings of the small pond were so quiet that only one or two bees occasionally buzzed by, and one or two small fish occasionally jumped in the duckweed, making a sound of splashing water that broke the silence, the surroundings of this small pond were filled with the vitality and vigor of duckweed, grass, wild roses, and all living things.</p>
<p>Unmarried girls are indeed lovable, but mature girls with beautiful lines have a different kind of charm. This is the unique beauty of early summer.</p>
<h3 id="e175">The Banana Tree Turns Green <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Shu Fan</p>
<p>As the gardens enter summer, all the greenery turns lush, vitality surging, making one feel refreshed. And the banana tree, with its fresh green color, brings coolness to the window screen, especially suitable for evoking reveries. When the morning dew first nourishes it, and the breeze caresses the eaves, one sees it standing tall and upright, like a humble maid offering her services, dressed in a green cloth skirt. Contemplating it always brings great joy. At midday, when it is slightly warm and the phoenix tail fern is quiet, the gentle breeze wafts through, bringing countless coolness, as if many young maids are holding green gauze fans. Then again, it seems self-admiring. By evening, when the sunset is intoxicating and the rosy clouds are faint, it is as if someone is swaying, holding a green curtain, surpassing Xie Daoyun in elegance. All these are my joyful reflections on a cluster of banana trees. As for moonlit nights, when the wind's murmur has not ceased, it resembles a recluse, sighing with ups and downs, then I can't help but wring my hands all night, pacing restlessly. Sometimes, in a curtain of drizzle, the bean lamp casts a sickly green glow, and hearing the tree's whispered complaints, it's like a grieving widow on the Cold Food Festival, weeping at her grave, even soaking through my spring clothes, sobbing uncontrollably. A small thing can move people so deeply, hence my singular devotion.</p>
<p>I remember my father telling me a story when I was a child: "In the past, Huai Su sat in the Green Heaven Monastery. He was poor and had no paper, so he used ten thousand banana leaves to write on, and made great progress. My son, you don't have to worry about paper and pens, so I hope you cherish them!" At that time, a crescent moon hung on the bean trellis, thin clouds were often cut by it, and shooting stars and fireflies were mixed in a chaotic shooting, my eyes followed them, my heart was amazed, I responded casually, without time to remember. Twenty years have passed in a flash, my father is already old and frail, although I labor with the inkstone, I have only made spring earthworm and autumn snake-like progress, without the slightest improvement. Every time I write a letter home, I still open it before sending it, not knowing where to start to express my shame.</p>
<p>At the age of ten, I studied at Hu's Suizhen Residence. My cousin, Ya Xue, was the most intelligent. Her essays and antithetical couplets were unmatched. She especially loved reciting poems from the Thousand-Character Classic. At sunset, after school was dismissed, I often saw her sitting under a banana tree, reciting a volume of poetry. Azure clouds streamed down on her pink collar and skirt, creating a unique and enchanting scene. She was absorbed in contemplation during meals, but when my cousin coughed, she turned red and fled back home, not daring to look directly for three days. This scene is vivid, as if it were yesterday. In late spring, I revisited the old school. The banana trees had grown taller and more luxuriant. I heard that A Ya had been a widow for over a year, how sad indeed!</p>
<p>From childhood, I was most cherished by my aunt, who kept me warm and comfortable, like a loving mother. When I was eleven, my aunt suddenly passed away from illness. It was the height of summer. The coffin was covered with banana leaves. I wailed until noon, my eyes blurred, only vaguely seeing my aunt lying in green clouds, still hoping that she would get up, pat my head, and give me biscuits. When I realized that my aunt would never return, I stamped my feet and cried loudly. Since then, every year when the banana leaves turn green, I see my aunt's kind face faintly emerging from them.</p>

<p>Wu Ma poured a cup of tea and placed it on the table, smiling, "Miss, you haven't smiled all day. It's like this book is a joyous event come to earth. You smiled as soon as you received it." Menglan said, "I don't have anything to be happy about right now, so I'm just using books to relieve boredom. Once the books arrive, I'll finish them in a day and a night, and then I'll have to wait another half a month. I'm happy for a moment when I receive the book, isn't it natural?" As she spoke, she reached out to flip through the magazine, first looking at the table of contents for the current issue. Among them was a line that read, "A Love That Can't Be," followed by the name Zhang Litian. She couldn't help but laugh and say, "This issue has another one of his tragic love stories." Wu Ma was startled, looking at her and saying, "Miss, what are you talking about?" Menglan raised her head, but her face turned red, smiling, "You don't know, I'm talking about something in the book. You wouldn't understand." Hearing that it was something she couldn't understand, Wu Ma saw no need to ask further and went downstairs. Menglan wiped the table clean and then spread the book open to read. Flipping past the table of contents, she saw a page with photos of the magazine's authors. The third photo was of a young man in his early twenties, exactly like the young man she had met at Yuhuatai today. She couldn't help but stare fixedly, gazing at him for a long time. After about ten minutes, she nodded to herself, muttering, "I guessed right, it really is him." Then she covered the book and pondered again. She felt as if the young man at Yuhuatai, with a smile, was standing in front of her desk. "Oh! I'm bewitched!" She propped her head and looked at the willow trees outside the window, trying to calm herself and cast aside this terrible illusion. But the willow branches were swaying in the wind, very much like the hem of the young man's clothes at Yuhuatai this afternoon, fluttering in the wind. She didn't dare to look out the window anymore and instead turned back to the table, flipping open the book. The story, "A Love That Can't Be," was published on the first page of the magazine, so she saw it as soon as she opened it. The story began:</p>
<p>"One evening, on a night of bright stars and a brilliant moon, autumn clouds floated across the sky, thin as silk gauze. Qin Yizhi and his intimate friend Lin Yinghua were drinking in a small room in a Mingxia Lane tavern. The bright lights shone, radiating charm, reflecting on Lin Yinghua's cheeks. A shy blush surged, reaching her temples, like rose petals. Once the wine was poured, she raised her cup and toasted, saying, 'May the joy of our meetings remain with us in our years of melancholy, with more laughter and less tears.'"</p>
<p>Seeing this, Menglan couldn't help but mutter to herself, "This is another soul-stirring story. This Mr. Zhang seems to have a grudge against the readers, determined to force all their tears out before he's satisfied." (31)</p>

<h3 id="e177">Rambling Chat on Goldfish <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Jiren</p>
<p>I haven't written about goldfish for months, but I am constantly surrounded by them. Every day, countless small fish are born, impossible to count. This year the weather is not good, and many hobbyists have reported fish diseases. This is partly due to careless water changes and partly due to the rainy weather.</p>
<p>It is easier to treat goldfish whose heads and tails have white patches. You can buy borax water at the pharmacy and mix it with warm water in the fish tank (warm water is water that has been boiled and left to cool for a week, not freshly boiled water). Take the fish out and put it in the bucket, and gently rub the white patches with your hand. The white rot will come off layer by layer. For mild cases, one bath is enough to cure them, and for severe cases, two or three times will be enough. It has been proven effective repeatedly.</p>
<p>If you want to get new and unusual varieties of goldfish, it is undoubtedly important to mix the breeds during mating. However, you must first pay attention to when they are carrying eggs (I seem to have mentioned this in a previous article, specifically in issue 37 last winter, because winter turns to spring, and fish's spring instincts are activated.) Then, when they are spawning, make them mix and chase each other, so you can hopefully get something. It is generally not advisable to mix too many types. For example, mixing "dragon eye" and "bubble eye" gives "dragon eye bubble eye," and mixing "celestial eye" and "bubble eye" gives "celestial bubble eye." It is definitely not advisable to mix bubble eye and "black moor" or "purple goldfish," hoping to create a "black celestial bubble eye" etc. You can only select one out of a hundred from this year's mixed breeds, choosing those with a straight head and eyes, or those with larger bubbles, and you will get "celestial bubble eyes" and "dragon eye bubble eyes." If you want to get blue or purple celestial bubble eyes and dragon eye bubble eyes, you must try again next spring using the same method. We only seek new varieties, not quantity, and a few will not be difficult to obtain.</p>
<p>The sex life of goldfish has some new discoveries. Recently, on humid and hot mornings and after changing to fresh water, you can be sure that there will be several tanks spawning. However, in the same tank, on the same day that new water is changed, one tank will be vigorously chasing each other, fighting over algae, neglecting everything to spawn, while in another tank, the males and females will be listless and motionless. I was curious and put a male fish into the spawning tank. In no time, it joined the fray, chasing tirelessly. I also put a female fish in there to test it. The males, seeing another object of interest, chased each other even more, vying and pursuing, not leaving for a moment, trying to get them to spawn at the same time. I then took a pair that were vigorously chasing each other and put them in a tank that was not spawning, but they also became listless as if nothing had happened. From this, it can be seen that spawning in goldfish is partly based on sexual arousal and partly related to the water. However, overly mature female fish, with abdomens as big as drums, swim awkwardly, and often release eggs among the algae without being chased by male fish, but these lone eggs may not hatch.</p>
<p>A few days ago, a friend came to my farm in Caohejing and visited me, talking about how he wanted to give me two male pearl goldfish, saying that the pearl goldfish he kept at home had big bellies but no sign of chasing, fearing they might have trouble spawning and die from bloating, so he had to get two male fish. I laughed and replied, noting that the mature female fish I had could lay eggs without being chased, so the bloating theory could be dismissed, but without male fish, there would definitely be no baby fish.</p>

<p>— Wang Zhiqin</p>
<p>Suzhou, famous for its beautiful scenery, is full of famous mountains and scenic spots. Xukou is also one of the famous scenic spots in Wudi. It is located near Muzhen, and is the main route to Taihu Lake. Xushan is to its south and Xiangshan is to its north. Xukou is located between the two mountains. Outside the mouth, the water connects with the sky, with silver waves, and inside the mouth, the scenery is secluded and beautiful, like an absolutely beautiful woman. There are no great buildings or important people's villas here. All there are are bamboo houses, willow pavilions, small boats and light gulls, flowing with the waves. However, tourists who see this natural water village map can't help but feel a sense of detachment. I hope that the elegant scholars who travel to Suzhou's Yan Hill will also take a trip to Xukou in the fishing village. If due to time constraints, they cannot have both, then abandoning the former and traveling to Xukou alone is also worthwhile.</p>

<p>Ye Tianshi from Suzhou was a famous doctor during the Yongzheng and Qianlong periods of the Qing Dynasty. He had a sharp mind and deep understanding of medicine, but was lazy and fond of playing, and did not often make house calls, earning him a reputation for arrogance. He often used strange and unusual methods to treat people's illnesses. He was skilled in treating all kinds of diseases. It is said that he studied with seventeen teachers in seven years. If a certain teacher had a specialty in a certain disease, he would master their method before leaving, so the essence of all schools was gathered in one person, and his great reputation was not accidental. Later, he cured the dangerous illness of Zhang Zhenren of Longhu Mountain and was given the title of Heavenly Doctor Star. The gentleman was also generous, and he always gave medicine and treatment to the poor and sick, saving countless lives. Even today, people still praise him.</p>
<p>The gentleman's mother once suffered from a feverish disease. He diagnosed and treated her himself, but observing her pulse, it seemed like a cold syndrome, and he dared not prescribe medicine hastily. He paced the courtyard in the evening, saying to himself, "If she were someone else's mother, I would use Baihu Decoction!" His words were heard by an old man from the neighboring family, also a doctor. The next day, the old man visited Tianshi, pretending to want to examine his mother. After examining her pulse, he prescribed Baihu Decoction, and she recovered miraculously after one dose. The old doctor's fame greatly increased. In fact, it was still Tianshi's achievement.</p>

<p>If the lost territory is compared to the provinces, it is equivalent to: Seven Sichuans; Twelve Guangdongs; Thirteen Hunan; Fourteen Shaanxi; Fifteen Hubei; Sixteen Henans; Seventeen Shanxis; Eighteen Shandong; Nineteen Anhui; Twenty-three Fujian; Twenty-seven Jiangsu; Twenty-eight Zhejiang.</p>
<p>If the lost territory is compared to foreign countries, it is even more shocking. It is equivalent to the sum of the land area of eleven countries: Japan, England, France, Germany, Italy, Austria, Hungary, Belgium, Netherlands, Denmark, and Sweden! In other words, it can also be said to be equal to: Four Frances; Five Germanys; Six Japans; Ten Englands; Sixty Switzerlands; Seventy Netherlands; Eighty Belgiums.</p>

<h3 id="e183">The New Development of China's Monetary Policy <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Lie Wang</p>
<p>Since the U.S. President announced the silver purchasing policy in December 1933, the world silver price has been entirely controlled by the United States. Last year, from April to May, the United States heavily purchased silver in the London market, causing silver prices to soar, reaching a high of over 33 pence in May. China was finally forced to abandon the silver standard on November 4 and implement currency management, with the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications buying and selling foreign exchange without restrictions to stabilize foreign exchange rates. However, after mid-December of that year, the United States stopped purchasing silver in the London market; China's currency system again felt a great threat. According to general opinion, the foreign exchange rate of the new currency system was pegged at one shilling and two and a half pence, and its parity with the silver reserve should be seventeen and seventy-five pence, the calculation method as follows:</p>
<p>? Pence = Standard Ounce of Silver</p>
<p>Standard Ounce of Pure Silver 23.49348 grams = One Yuan Silver Coin</p>
<p>That is to say, only when the value of each ounce of new standard silver in London is 17.75 pence, the actual value of one yuan silver coin is equivalent to one shilling and two and a half pence. If the London silver price falls below 17.75 pence, it will not be easy to maintain the foreign exchange rate of one shilling and two and a half pence. Because Article 4 of the legal tender decree announced by the Ministry of Finance on November 4 last year stipulates: "All silver firms, shops, and other public and private institutions or individuals holding silver standard coins or other silver coins, raw silver, etc., should, from November 4, hand them over to the Issuance Reserve Management Committee or its designated bank for exchange into legal tender. In addition to silver standard coins being exchanged for legal tender at face value, the remaining silver will be exchanged according to the actual amount of pure silver contained." In this way, if the London silver price falls below 17.75 pence, overseas silver will flow into China again, exchanged for legal tender according to the actual amount of pure silver contained, and then the three banks will purchase shillings with legal tender, and the foreign exchange reserve of the three banks can be exhausted in an instant. I believe that this danger can still be avoided. Since China has actually stopped the silver standard, the Ministry of Finance can revise the previous decree if necessary, and can set another market price and purchase at price, so that those who take advantage have no profit to make, then this danger can be avoided. What is worrying is that the international balance of payments is still in a reverse state (according to the Bank of China's 20th-year report and G. Edward's estimate of the international balance of payments, the export of silver and gold still occupies an important position). In the future, the maintenance of foreign exchange reserves still requires the sale of silver in exchange. If the silver price falls, then we must exchange a large amount of silver for a small amount of foreign currency. If the silver price falls, then we must exchange a large amount of silver for a small amount of foreign currency. Today, one yuan silver coin can be exchanged for one shilling and a half pence, and in the future, it may be necessary to exchange one and a half yuan for it. Therefore, the foreign exchange reserve will inevitably feel weak. If it reaches the point of desperation, then we can only lower the foreign exchange rate to protect ourselves, and the stability of the exchange rate will fail as a result. The danger of falling silver prices lies in this and not in that. However, many commentators say that from now on, judging from the actual situation of silver supply and demand, it should hover around 19 pence, and will not fall again. How it will be in the end, I am afraid it is not easy to predict.</p>
<p>Today, the only buyer of silver is the United States. In the past, China was a demander of silver. Since abandoning the silver standard last year, it has changed into a supplier of silver. However, China is restricted by the 1933 Silver Agreement and cannot sell in the London market during the agreement period (expiring in 1938). Even without this restriction, if the United States stops purchasing silver, the London silver market will never improve, and China is also unwilling to sell at low prices. In order to find a way out for the silver reserve, it is necessary to consult with the United States. The United States' use of the silver purchase policy originally had the intention of manipulating China's currency system, so that China had to associate with it in order to expand the scope of the dollar group. Since Chen Guangfu and others went to the United States to negotiate a currency agreement with the US financial authorities, both China and the United States were tight-lipped at first. Only recently have various news spread. US Senator King declared that the Chinese representatives went to Washington to purchase silver from the United States. This news was quite surprising to all parties. Since King is a representative of the silver faction, it is also possible that he said this to confuse the public. All parties may as well listen to it for the time being. China feels that there is no way to dispose of the silver reserve, so how can there be any reason to buy silver from the United States again? Later, it was rumored that China would soon mint silver dollars, with the intention of restoring the silver standard, which is even more absurd. As the Bank of China report said: "At this time of rising and falling silver prices, and the disputes over the domestic economy, unless most countries believe that silver still has a use value in the currency system, considering the restoration of the silver standard would be a major mistake." Recently, it has been rumored that the government will recast one yuan silver coins, with the size and color only equal to one-third of the original silver dollar; and it is said that this recasting is equivalent to devaluation. The Minister of Finance has already published a statement in the newspaper to correct it. Regarding the minting of silver coins, G. Edward, who has always been valued by the financial community, has also repeatedly spoken about it. He also expressed sympathy for the petition of the silver industry (Note 1). On the 11th of this month, a Reuters dispatch from New York reported that "The US Treasury Department needs 730,000,000 ounces of silver to complete its silver purchasing plan. A portion of it should be purchased from China. Although China is very willing to sell its silver reserve to the United States, it will inevitably have considerable exchange conditions." The above is the news about the new currency system for the past month.</p>
<p>On the 18th of this month, the Ministry of Finance officially announced a declaration, divided into three points:</p>
<p>(1) In order to fully maintain the credit of legal tender, the government's cash reserve shall be composed of gold, silver, and foreign exchange. The silver reserve should account for at least 25% of the total issuance.</p>
<p>(2) In order to facilitate merchants and the public, the government will mint half-yuan and one-yuan silver coins to complete the categories of hard currency.</p>
<p>(3) In order to enhance the consolidation of the legal tender's position, the government's cash reserve has already raised huge amounts of money, which will fully increase gold and foreign exchange.</p>
<p>In addition, there is one point that is very noteworthy, that is, the silver industry has repeatedly requested to revise the silver product management rules for several months, and it has been approved. In the future, the use of silver for silver products will still be handled according to the original practice.</p>
<p>According to a Washington National Electric telegram on the 18th, "Finance Minister H.H. Kung and representatives of the Chinese Ministry of Finance have established a Sino-US currency agreement. The content of which has long been eagerly awaited by the outside world, today has been released by Finance Minister H.H. Kung, saying that China and the United States have established an agreement, and the United States will begin to purchase a large amount of Chinese silver. The purpose of the purchase is to assist the Chinese government's new currency policy and to fulfill the Silver Purchase Act passed by the US Congress in 1934. The agreement is sufficient to assist the success of international currency stability, and later prepare to take the same action to stabilize currency with other countries, but separate talks with various countries are more appropriate than the method of international conferences, it is said. Mr. Kung then announced the amount of money to purchase Chinese silver, saying that he was prepared to pay in cash or US dollars, as for the quantity to be purchased, it will be kept secret! But it will be carried out immediately, and the price will be based on the monthly average price of the world market."</p>
<p>Summarizing the new developments of this currency system, there are the following three points:</p>
<p>(1) With the establishment of a currency agreement with the United States, the problem of the way out for China's silver reserve has been resolved. (Whether there are other conditions in the currency agreement is still unknown.)</p>
<p>(2) Restore the use of silver, one is to recast silver coins, and the other is that silver products are still handled according to the original practice.</p>
<p>(3) Clearly stipulate that the silver reserve accounts for 25% of the total issuance.</p>
<p>Now, let's examine these three points one by one.</p>
<p>First, the content of the Sino-US currency agreement is still unknown. The telegram only said that China's silver reserve can be sold to the United States. But the connection between the Sino-US currency values is a matter of course. Some say that the US currency has not yet reached a stable point, and the US President still has the possible power to devalue the US dollar by another 10%. In the event that the United States does devalue the currency, our exchange rate with other countries will also change accordingly. This is indeed possible. But when weighing two evils, choose the lesser, and when weighing two benefits, choose the greater. The most pressing issue for China's currency system is how to maintain foreign exchange reserves. Maintaining foreign exchange reserves still depends on the sale of silver reserves. If the silver price falls, it will be very unfavorable to us. And the foreign silver market has been manipulated by the United States, so there is no other way but to discuss with it. Otherwise, the future of the silver reserve is unknown. Whether the US dollar will be devalued again is a matter for the future, but the decision on the way out for the silver reserve is imminent. Weighing the pros and cons, this move cannot be said to be a misstep.</p>
<p>Second, the US silver purchasing policy was originally promoted by silver faction congressmen, and its origin should be political. Later, it combined the political purpose with the attempt of an international dual reserve system, the so-called expansion of the dollar group. The United States is very unfavorable to it. China was originally the largest silver-using country. If even silver products are prohibited, the United States will not be happy to hear it. With the establishment of this Sino-US currency agreement, our country announced the restoration of silver use, which may be one of the agreement conditions. As for minting silver dollars to represent the currency in circulation, although it does not harm the new currency system, it has only been half a year since the silver standard was abandoned. Now there is a sudden announcement of minting light-quality silver dollars, and the old silver dollars have not yet been completely collected. People in the interior, who are not enlightened, will inevitably be confused by this. The Ministry of Finance urgently needs to instruct local governments to clearly inform them so that people have something to follow.</p>
<p>Third, since the establishment of the new currency system, although the government has stated that the legal tender reserve is still 60% cash silver and 40% securities, the value of the silver reserve has actually been calculated according to the foreign exchange rate, and foreign exchange and gold have also been added to the reserve (the actual reserve required is only foreign exchange). Now it is clearly stipulated that the cash silver reserve should account for 25% of the total issuance. Originally, China had the possibility of fully adopting a foreign exchange reserve. Now, it has become a definite and undoubtedly dual reserve system. This is the most noteworthy point in the history of the new currency system. Since the US announced the silver purchasing policy, it immediately remembered the dual reserve system of four parts gold and one part silver. Its ambition is to promote it to various countries. The telegram said: "Later prepare to take the same action to stabilize currency with other countries, but separate talks with various countries are more appropriate than the method of international conferences." The establishment of this Sino-US currency agreement is a very good experience for the United States. Therefore, the Reuters telegram from the Shanghai Evening Post on the 21st reported that Biderman, the leader of the silver faction, declared: "This agreement is an example that Latin American countries should follow, and the case proposed by the United States at the London Economic Conference that the cash reserves of the central banks of various countries should maintain 20% silver is the basis of this agreement." According to a Washington National Electric telegram from the Great American Evening Post on the 19th, "Today the United States decided to begin the second step of the world currency stability work plan in order to restore international trade and seek world peace. The work plan was decided after signing the agreement to purchase silver with China. People here firmly believe that the United States will soon begin separate talks with the great powers on the issue of war debts owed by various countries to the United States in order to solve this difficult problem. Government officials today feel the same way that currency stability and the current state of international trade are deeply related to the solution of the war debt issue." The United States attempts to lead international currency: holding its two weapons—war debts and silver policy, and dealing with countries in the East and West. Now the silver policy has been successful, and it wants to further negotiate with various countries separately on the war debt issue in order to carry out its international dual-standard system. However, the suspicions of various countries are still deep, and the nationalistic fervor is still high. Various restrictions on international trade, such as tariff barriers, quota allocation systems, blocked accounts, and exchange restrictions, still exist. If only seeking the stability of international currency, whether it can be as the United States wishes is highly questionable. On the other hand, the dual-standard system has long been rejected by various countries. For the stability of international currency, European countries advocate the establishment of an international clearing bank through international common agreements, saving the use of cash, and still using the gold value standard. This is the opinion of general economists. It may not be able to coordinate with the US's proposal, and the US's attempt is obviously self-serving, and the political effect of the silver faction is also very profound. Whether European countries are willing to accommodate the US's proposal is also questionable. Although the United States can use war debts as a threat, various countries can delay and deny it, and there is nothing they can do. However, on the reverse side, in order to seek the stability of international currency, it is indispensable for those with gold strength like the United States to take the lead. Otherwise, the international deadlock will never be opened. However, leaders must have a spirit of sacrifice. If prejudices are too deep and they only seek profit, and want to use force to control various countries, and force them to follow me, it will eventually be in vain.</p>
<p>In terms of the dual-standard system, international common adoption is theoretically recognized by economists in various countries. The problem is whether the countries originally using gold have this need. They think that as long as the United States releases the gold in the vault, the international currency problem can be solved (this problem is very complicated and cannot be discussed in detail here). There is no need to adopt an international dual-standard system. Therefore, whether these two opinions can approach each other is still unknown. China's situation is different from that of gold-using countries. China originally used silver, and most of the reserve was originally cash silver. What is needed is how to obtain the supply of foreign exchange reserves. This time, the signing of a currency agreement with the United States is exactly what we need; for them, it is a touchstone for carrying out their international dual-standard system. The establishment of the agreement is not accidental. However, the United States believes that the success of the Sino-US currency agreement can be used as a precedent for separate negotiations with other countries; I am afraid it is too optimistic. As for us, we certainly hope it will succeed. (Yao Qingsan's "The Future of the New Monetary Policy in the Midst of Falling Silver Prices and the Proposal of a Dual Reserve System" in the Second Issue of the Third Volume of the Social Economic Monthly can be used as a reference.)</p>
<p>Finally, the United Kingdom did not express any opinion in advance on the establishment of this Sino-US currency agreement, and afterwards it praised it quite a bit. The establishment of China's new currency system has been mostly assisted by the United Kingdom. Now that China has signed a currency agreement with the United States, how can the United Kingdom be willing to do so? This point should be explored by the general public. In my opinion, the United Kingdom does not need to compete with the United States for China's currency system, nor can it compete with the United States. The pound and the US dollar have now stabilized at pre-war parity. If the monetary policies of both sides stabilize the currency with the US dollar, there is gradually no reason why it should not be stable with the pound. The United Kingdom sits back and enjoys the success, so why not sympathize with the United States? This is why the United Kingdom does not need to compete with the United States. The United States has the power to manipulate the world silver price, and the way out for China's silver reserve must be helped by the United States. The United Kingdom really cannot do anything. Last time, when the United States stopped purchasing silver in London, the London banking community wanted to unite and purchase it, but it was only a flash in the pan and there was no result. This is why the United Kingdom cannot compete with the United States. As for whether the United Kingdom and the United States had prior understanding, it is not known.</p>

<h3 id="e184">On Minting Silver Coins <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Qiong</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance recently issued a declaration, stating the government's original intention to maintain the stability of currency value and to determine its independent autonomy, which shows that the government's determination to seek domestic economic stability is always based on consolidating the credit of the legal tender itself, and will never vacillate between countries or be an appendage of others. This policy of "self-reliance" should be learned by the people of the country. As for the three points declared, the first and third are both seeking to enrich the reserve and determine the basis of credit. This has always been the government's consistent policy and is the fundamental way to consolidate the credit of legal tender, so there is nothing to discuss. The second point is the reminting of new silver coins, which is not what the general public expected, and it is necessary to pay attention to it now. The original text said: "In order to facilitate merchants and the public, the government will mint half-yuan and one-yuan silver coins to complete the types of hard currency." When concentrating silver and strictly prohibiting the circulation of hard currency, suddenly declaring the reminting of silver coins will inevitably cause misunderstandings in many ways. Judging from the current domestic situation, it seems unnecessary to increase the minting of silver coins. Since the prohibition of silver coin circulation on November 4 last year, the circulation of the main and auxiliary legal tender has been unimpeded. Even in the stubborn poor materials that were usually considered to be accustomed to using hard currency, the promotion has been smooth and without difficulty, which proves that people can adapt to the new environment at any time. Since transactions have not been hindered, there is no need to mint silver coins to seek transaction convenience. Therefore, we infer that the intention in the middle may not be without international difficulties. However, it is useless to say what has been done. What we should pay attention to is the future problems and the location of the problems, and guide them according to the situation, so that we can remove the disadvantages and move to the benefits at any time. I humbly present several points as follows.</p>
<p>First, since the government implements coinage, it will inevitably issue circulation; otherwise, the cost of coinage will become a useless waste. Since what the Ministry of Finance has decided to mint is one-yuan and half-yuan silver coins, it can be known that they cannot be regarded as auxiliary coins. The government must stipulate the legal price of these silver coins in legal tender for circulation, and the two legal prices. How to always maintain their uniform circulation is a question worth considering. In our opinion, the new silver coins minted by the government must also be a named representative coin, whose actual value must be below the face value, but it still has a considerable amount of actual value. In the general psychology of the people, there may be biases. This is especially possible in general inland areas. Therefore, how to keep the prices of the two consistent at all times seems to be a question that should be considered. In our opinion, since the government has already reminted silver coins, the amount of silver coins and legal tender should each have considerable restrictions, so that the price of both will not be high due to the small quantity, and the price will not be cheap due to the large quantity. Before the new coins are minted in considerable quantities, it is not necessary to issue them for circulation for the time being, so as to prevent speculation and hoarding.</p>
<p>Second, the government is currently concentrating silver. At present, the purchasing power of legal tender and silver coins in the market is completely equal. Because there is no room for comparison in people's minds, they only know that paper money and silver coins represent the same meaning in transactions. Therefore, the concentration process is less difficult. If the newly minted silver coins representing the currency are issued for circulation in the market at this time, the new silver coins and the old silver coins will inevitably have an impression of currency depreciation, and they will change their past psychology and hoard the old silver coins tightly, which is tantamount to adding another layer of resistance to the concentration of cash. This is probably unavoidable by the facts. Therefore, we advocate that although the government has started minting silver coins, it does not have to rush to issue them for circulation, but in a short period of time, intensify the concentration of old silver coins, so as to avoid market confusion and self-destruction of the policy of concentrating cash. If silver coins of unequal value are forced to have equal market prices, then the old poor will hoard them tightly, which is unavoidable. The government's policy of concentrating cash will probably be destroyed by itself.</p>
<p>Third, at present, the external exchange rate of legal tender is maintained stable, which is a policy that we should always maintain. Legal tender cannot be cashed, but foreign exchange can be purchased at legal prices, which is the so-called foreign exchange standard. Although the newly minted representative silver coins can also purchase foreign exchange at the same legal price, they have a considerable amount of actual value, and the habit of using cash among the people has not been completely changed. I am afraid that after the new silver coins are issued, there will be a natural tendency to gradually flow into the inland rural areas, while legal tender will be mostly concentrated in cities that can be directly exchanged for foreign exchange at any time. If so, the rural currency and the urban currency will gradually differentiate in an invisible way, silver coins will circulate in the rural areas, and legal tender will circulate in the cities. I am afraid that over time, the circulation of legal tender in the inland will be harmed by silver coins. According to the actual environment of our country, this is very likely. How to prevent this natural differentiation of circulation areas is a question worth considering now.</p>
<p>Fourth, at present, the international situation is uncertain, and our country's position is particularly vulnerable to the influence of the international environment. According to the experience of various countries, when international relations change, the circulation of hard currency is most easily affected. For example, the US silver auxiliary coins in the Civil War era, although the difference between their face value and actual value was very large, they were all hidden in an instant. Another example is France during the European War. At first, in order to regulate the market, the central bank issued a large amount of silver coins, and the difference between the face value and the actual value was also large, but soon they were all hidden in secret and disappeared from the market. The new silver coins in our country, even if their face value is not based on their actual value, I am afraid that after international incidents occur, they will also be hidden and disappear, which will be enough to make the market rigid at first, transactions stagnant, and after a long time, there will inevitably be black market transactions, disrupting the market and hindering the circulation of legal tender. This is as clear as pointing to the palm, which can be foreseen. How to prevent this phenomenon from happening seems to be something to be considered repeatedly at this time.</p>
<p>Fifth, what is the fineness and weight of the new silver coins is currently unknown, but in fact, I am afraid that it will not be too low; if it is too low, it will inevitably have an impact on the psychology of the people. In the case that the cash - old silver coins have not been completely concentrated, if the price of the new silver coins is too low, it is enough to affect the people's confidence in the new currency system, because there is still a part of the old silver coins that can be compared in secret. If the price of the new silver coins is actually not very low, then the external value of the legal tender has obviously been restricted by this, and the flexibility of retreat. Then it is an undeniable fact. This point must also be considered at the beginning of coinage.</p>
<p>The above five points are our opinions on minting new silver coins. Judging from the facts, we deeply believe that it is unnecessary to mint silver coins. Since the implementation of the legal tender policy, the foreign exchange has been stable and the legal tender has been circulating unimpeded, sweeping away the mist of the silver standard for several years. In the future, as long as the exchange rate can be maintained stable externally and the financial institutions can be gradually improved internally to suit this brand-new system, the domestic economy can wait for the time to come. Minting silver coins seems to be unnecessary at present. However, we can adapt to changes and avoid the generation of future adverse effects at any time. There is still something to say, since the government announced the reminting of silver coins, the general discussion has misunderstood that this is related to the recent fall in silver prices. Some even said that the government could not sell silver, so it turned to minting silver coins, which is even more absurd. The value of our country's currency is purely unaffected by the price of silver. The high or low price of silver has absolutely no relationship with the value of our country's currency. Judging from our country at present, the rise and fall of silver prices are the same as the rise and fall of silk prices or tung oil prices. The high price of silver can indeed allow our country to gain more profits when selling silver, and we will inevitably suffer losses when the price of silver is low, but it is only limited to the less price obtained when selling silver coins, and it has absolutely no relationship with the currency system. Moreover, judging from the silver that can be sold at present, even if the silver price falls by half, the loss suffered by our country is probably not as large as the loss caused by the reduction of soybean exports from our country's international trade after the loss of the Northeast. Why should we be so worried about this? The reason for reminting silver coins is definitely not here. We can only recognize it as a kind of expedient policy of the government to cope with the international environment.</p>

<p>Last week, from June 1st to 6th, the market situation of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange fluctuated greatly. The situation in North China changed abruptly, and rumors in South China followed. These were embellished and filled with suspicion and fear. The Hong Kong market experienced massive changes, foreign exchange was in demand, and the public bond market experienced a significant drop. Although the bullish side is still struggling to move forward, it remains to be seen whether they can overcome this rough and dangerous path. According to observations of the current situation, most of the major players selling off in recent days are those with physical goods. For example, categories E and B of No. 47, categories C and D of No. 48, category A of the North Gang, and category D of No. 72 are substantial in number. According to the reporter's investigation, all of them need to recover cash. The retail investors are quite active, buying high and selling low, and fluctuating uncertainly. However, the bearish side with physical goods is unwilling to cover their positions unless at a considerable low price. Therefore, the future of the bond market is not optimistic due to the multiple uncertainties of the environment. Although the decline last week was relatively severe, it was still spiraling downward. On Monday, it fell by twelve to eight cents. On Tuesday, retail investors covered their short positions and the bullish side pushed up the price, increasing by as much as twenty-three to seven cents. The increase was too rapid, so it attracted large-scale selling from major players on Wednesday. All the gains of the previous day were lost. On Friday, rumors were rampant, and those with real strength sold off, mostly for this month, especially category E, which plummeted by sixty to seventy cents. On Saturday, the rumors did not subside, and the selling side was still strong, falling by about another half a dollar. As a result of the week's market prices, the overall decline ranged from forty-five cents to one dollar and forty cents. Category C for this month fell the most, by one dollar and forty cents, while category B for this month fell the least, by only forty-five cents. The total transaction volume was 39,415,000 yuan. The results of the increases and decreases are compared in the following table: (Unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened higher due to unfavorable weather conditions in the east. Wall Street brokers and counterparts actively bought, leading to a new peak in the price of new cotton. Foreign merchants' transactions were limited, except for Japanese merchants with price limits. Subsequently, due to a private report that both northern and southern parts of Carolina had received rainfall, sentiment became unstable, long positions were liquidated, and local brokers sold off, causing the market price to fall slightly. Before the close, the cotton storage department sold July futures, with minimal fluctuations. Spot prices fell by 2 British pounds, and futures fell by 2 to 15 British pounds. British cotton was closed. Indian cotton initially rose due to buying of April-May futures, but then weakened due to the liquidation of July-August long positions. Pingguoer rose by 0.25 rupees, Aomula rose by half a rupee, and Bairoxi rose by 0.75 rupees. Original telegram on the left (dated 6th).</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday's supply from various sources reached just over ten boats, totaling more than 3,000 shi of grain. Market sentiment stabilized slightly, and sales in this street improved. Brokers from both North and South Ocean areas purchased 1,2300 bags, so the situation is slightly tight. Market prices surged, with thick Zaogeng rice and thin Daogeng rice rising by ten cents. Du Yangjian and Zubiangyuan rice remained flat.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday's supply from various routes down the river reached thirty-six or seven boats. The market for white rice at rice shops stabilized, and retail sales of thin Daogeng rice were slightly active, with prices increasing by a few cents. Zubiang rice also had sales, with prices also tightening by nearly ten cents. Du Jian rice tightened by a few cents, and Yangbu Kejian rice sales were normal, with prices slightly tight. The prices of all other grains were firm.</p>

<p>Hunan antimony is one of China's export metal products. In recent years, various countries have been relentlessly preparing for war, so the sales of this commodity to various countries in the East and West have been considerable. However, since the discovery of antimony mines in the Soviet Union and the Philippines, Hunan antimony has been hit hard, and sales have decreased. Overseas sales have been quite sluggish in recent weeks. According to various investigations, this is actually due to the fact that too much cargo was previously shipped, and it has not yet been completely sold. Fortunately, the sentiment in this port is good, and the inventory is also weak, so the selling price has not changed much. The current market price is 750 yuan per ton. Apart from sporadic transactions, there are very few large-scale transactions in the market.</p>

<h3 id="e190">Rumors Caused by Increased Troop Deployments in North China <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Jing</p>
<p>Due to increased troop deployments by a certain party in the recent days in the Tianjin and Peiping areas, rumors have suddenly emerged, and the people are in a state of panic, as if they cannot live through the day. However, the content of the rumors is rarely reported in newspapers, making it impossible to know. Yesterday, the authorities in the North issued a statement, claiming that the current steps to deal with the situation are: internally, to strengthen spiritual unity and work hard on local construction; externally, to prioritize peace, and to conduct all matters based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for sovereignty. However, the extraordinary situation and the state of unrest in North China in recent days have all been caused single-handedly by a certain party. The responsibility for the rumors should be borne by that party. The authorities have compromised and explained their policies, originally out of good intentions, but truly out of desperation.</p>
<p>Loving peace is inherently a characteristic of the Chinese people, and "it is better to have one less thing than one more" has become a Chinese proverb. However, mutual benefit and mutual respect must be based on facts. Now, a certain party is increasing troop deployments every day, engaging in smuggling everywhere, and still using peace and friendship as a pretext, which is no different from playing with infants. I wonder, under what circumstances can it be said that there is no peace and no friendship? Is peace and friendship really like this? If a certain party deceives us in the name of peace and friendship, and we still deceive ourselves in the name of peace and friendship, it is perhaps understandable that others deceive us, but it is extremely unwise for us to deceive ourselves.</p>
<p>Compromising and seeking completeness originally stems from desperation, but compromising and seeking completeness must also have a considerable limit, and it is not simply about compromising and seeking completeness in everything. The current situation of compromising and seeking completeness is probably thousands of times beyond the appropriate limit. Moreover, compromising and seeking completeness means that compromising must seek completeness. If compromising cannot seek completeness, it is better not to compromise. The ancients had a saying, "Better to be a shattered jade than an intact tile." I would go one step further and say, it is understandable if the tile can remain intact, but if this continues, I fear that the tile will no longer be able to remain intact.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Even mosquitoes need to lay yellow eggs," meaning that the emergence of rumors must have a reason. Instead of repeatedly issuing statements to calm people's hearts, it is better to investigate the source of the rumors and make that party cease its unwarranted actions, so that the rumors will subside on their own. Otherwise, the more the rumors are suppressed, the more aggressive that party will become, and the more uneasy people will feel. Therefore, as the saying goes, "The one who tied the bell must untie it."</p>
<p>Not only that, but now there is also the so-called bombing case on the Beining Railway. It is still under investigation as to which party caused it and who carried it out, so it is impossible to know. However, according to a Havas report, the British Liberal Party's News Chronicle criticized the incident, saying that "the bombing case on the Beining Railway is exactly the same as the bombing of the railway tracks near Shenyang in 1931. The previous bombing resulted in the creation of a puppet state, and this bombing also happened to occur on the day when a certain party's plan to increase troop deployments in North China was completed." If this is the case, then that party is not only unwilling to eliminate rumors, but is also creating rumors every day. I ask, how can the rumors be quelled?</p>

<p>— Ai Tu</p>
<p>When she was directing the workers with the air of a woman, she scolded them as if she were fierce:</p>
<p>"What! How many plates in total, how much money?"</p>
<p>That voice was simply a scream!</p>
<p>At first, we found her voice annoying, but as we observed her day by day, we felt a sadness that pierced our souls. Yes, that's right. Look at her all day, like a prisoner being watched by her parents, sitting in the accounting counter, staring at everything dull and devoid of childlike innocence. The cars on the road stirred up arrogant dust, ruthlessly assaulting that still-childlike face.</p>
<p>"Why don't you smile?" we teased her.</p>
<p>"Don't bother people! Who wants to smile like you?"</p>
<p>She pursed her small lips and screamed as if she were bursting out with angry flames. Her face was full of anger, and the breath of innocence had long been devoured by demons! Perhaps her lively heart was frustrated by this kind of life.</p>
<p>"However, shouldn't you be smiling? Your mother still smiles, and she's not as fierce as you!"</p>
<p>She was almost about to cry, and her eyes were red.</p>
<p>"Little girl, if you don't smile more in the spring, then you will be forever silenced, and you will demand a happy soul!"</p>
<p>This sentence stimulates the souls of all people in the universe who are without happiness.</p>
<p>She suddenly, as if in rebellion, slapped the table:</p>
<p>"Get out of here, you have to tease me! Drunkard!"</p>
<p>Like a heartbroken woman, tears flowed down, exhausted, with no more anger.</p>
<p>In this way, we were silent afterward, looking at her wounded face, sighing.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Early Summer <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Leng Yan</p>
<p>"Early summer is a season without sorrow."</p>
<p>I don't know which gentleman said that. Literary youths in Shanghai often enjoy writing about autumn and spring. I understand the reason for this: young people's emotions are rich, and spring and autumn are seasons that easily evoke sentiments. Isn't lamenting spring and grieving autumn a major part of Chinese literature?</p>
<p>As for me, I am most delighted by early summer. Spring is full of flowers and brocades, which are indeed very beautiful, but because there are flowers everywhere, in red and purple, I can't help but feel "tedious," and to put it bluntly, it is somewhat "vulgar." For example, a young girl, although very charming, ultimately cannot get rid of a petty air in her "demeanor."</p>
<p>Autumn has long been likened to a plain-dressed widow by the ancients. Clear, sparse, and distant, it is not without charm, but glancing around always makes one feel depressed and unhappy. Only in early summer, after the tea roses bloom and the flowers are gone, the green trees are shady and thick, which is very pleasant, like a young woman who has just removed her makeup, with her forehead hair all brushed up, bright and smooth, making people feel relaxed. However, this kind of goodness cannot be understood by young men and women. Even for myself, it has only been in the last year or two that I have truly understood the goodness of early summer.</p>
<p>It has been three or four years since I left the countryside. Recalling this time, green seedlings are everywhere, shady summer trees extend from nearby to the horizon. The rural area at noon is so quiet that there is no sound. If you bring a book alone and read it by the stream, letting the water and wind flow through your hair, you will definitely feel an indescribable joy. At this time, you don't have to immerse yourself in the sea of ​​fantasy. The current scenery is really too comfortable and satisfying for you.</p>
<p>Yes, early summer is indeed sleepy weather. If you really feel sleepy while reading a book, then you might as well lean against a tree and doze off. Anyway, there is a clear and loud cuckoo sound to wake you up. It not only wakes you up, but also uses its cry to refresh you. Because its cry is neither as trivial as the oriole's nor as melancholic as the cuckoo's, its cry is equally filled with the brightness of early summer.</p>
<p>It often flies from afar, its cry resounding from the horizon to the clouds. It slowly moves away, its cry resounding from the clouds back to the horizon. Gradually, it can't be heard anymore, and then the universe returns to the tranquility it had before.</p>
<p>In the evening, the countryside in early summer is even more peaceful. The smoke from cooking fires is so light that it is invisible, and waterwheels everywhere are singing happily, with water droplets splashing like flying jade. Then the strong young men sing, singing of the hardships of life, singing of the intensity of love, but when they are intoxicated by the current scenery, they also praise the rice seedlings and the cuckoos.</p>
<p>Beautiful scenery often makes people forget about work, but early summer does not make people indulge. It is only full of the pleasure of life. Just from this point of view, the praise of early summer is already certain.</p>
<p>Early summer is as described above in the countryside. In fact, early summer is even more wonderful in the courtyard. "Green banana trees divide the green onto the window gauze," heavy curtains hang down, tea and chess are leisurely, leaning wearily against the north window, the spirit meets with the ancients. "Paper screens don't pillow on bamboo square beds, tired of throwing books for a long midday nap." The ancients wrote many leisurely poems and prose at this time. As for "cities," the expression of the season is only on the clothing of women, because early summer is neither cold nor warm, or it may be a bit more active. I can't know for sure.</p>
<p>"Early summer is a season without sorrow."</p>

<p>— Er He</p>
<p>When Zhao Erbo looked up, the rain had become finer. He took his旱烟管 (hanyanguan, dry tobacco pipe) from the horizontal bar of the table. From a dark tobacco pouch, he pinched a wad of tobacco with his long fingers, then gathered it into a ball in his left palm and stuffed it into the pipe's head. He slowly lit it, and then two thick wisps of smoke billowed from his nostrils.</p>
<p>When he looked up again, the rain had become even finer. His tightly furrowed brow gradually relaxed like a banana leaf after the rain.</p>
<p>"Probably won't rain again, right?" he muttered to himself, smiling. A wave of yellow flashed before his eyes; he saw large ears of wheat.</p>
<p>Unconsciously, he increased the force with which he smoked, and the wisps of smoke that billowed from his nostrils were even thicker. "Hiss, hiss," there was a rhythmic, subtle sound on his pipe's head, which happened to be under the counter. Therefore, in the thin darkness, the firelight on the pipe's head rose and fell with the "hiss, hiss" sound. He was waiting, waiting for the rain to stop so he could go to the field ridge to have a look.</p>
<p>However, it seemed as if Heaven was deliberately mocking him: the rain gradually increased again. This made him anxious; the joy of earlier had been shattered by the sound of the rain. He hated the endless rain, which had been falling for so many days. Wouldn't it ever stop? He knew that these days were crucial for both the wheat harvest and the planting of rice. The wheat stalks had grown very well; it looked like there would definitely be a good harvest. However, the ears of wheat had only just emerged. Without adequate sunlight, constantly drenched in the rain, they would only grow stalks, and the ears would not be filled. If the ears of wheat were not filled, the harvest would of course be reduced. Furthermore, judging from the current situation, the reduction would be substantial. He scratched the top of his head with his right hand, sighing helplessly:</p>
<p>"Everything's turned upside down! This year is worse than the last!"</p>
<p>He packed another pipe with tobacco. He was usually somewhat stingy with tobacco, but his heart was truly too bitter. Without burning some tobacco, he simply couldn't settle himself down. At the same time, looking at the bright ashes he had just knocked out, he felt as if saving a match could compensate him for it. Without hesitation, he began to smoke his second pipe.</p>
<p>As he smoked, the rain still fell intermittently, sometimes heavy, sometimes light, sometimes stopping, sometimes continuing.</p>
<p>Last year, the wheat had all been destroyed by hail. This year, it was about to be harvested, but unexpectedly, there were seven or eight days of continuous rain. He thought of his family, who were finding it difficult to make a living, and his brow furrowed even more tightly. He had lived for over fifty years, and he had never seen harvests like these in recent years: either there was drought, or there was flooding; if there wasn't flooding, then there were insect plagues. A pile of terrifying darkness congealed before his eyes. He knocked out the ashes from his second pipe, stood up, and looked at the sky. The sky was dark and gloomy; the rain had only become a little lighter.</p>
<p>Braving the drizzle, he walked towards the field ridge. His feet were quite muddy, and there was a constant danger of falling down. His feet always couldn't stand firmly. He grieved for his aging, and he thought of his prime. He couldn't help but mutter to himself: "The sun is going to set anyway; the sun is going to set anyway!" (Note) However, the power of life encouraged him. No matter what, he had to continue living. He carefully and safely reached his own wheat field. He stroked the wheat stalks as if stroking a beloved but unfortunate child.</p>
<p>The wheat stalks had grown very tall. He knew that this wasn't a good sign; he knew that the ears of wheat this year would definitely not be filled, and there would definitely be a large discount. So his brow furrowed tightly.</p>
<p>Although it was a drizzle, it slowly soaked his torn coat. He looked at the western sky; his only hope was that it wouldn't rain again from this moment on. Lonely and desolate, he slipped and slid his way back home on the muddy road.</p>
<p>In the evening, he packed a pipe with tobacco, turned off the kerosene lamp, and was about to lie down in bed when he heard the sound of rain hitting the thatched roof very loudly. His brow furrowed tightly again, and another pile of terrifying darkness congealed before his eyes. "Hiss, hiss," he took a few forceful puffs and knocked out the ashes. Then, without sparing it, he smoked a second pipe. He knew that he definitely wouldn't be able to sleep tonight.</p>
<p>Note—"The sun is setting" alludes to the approach of death.</p>

<p>— Zhu Lu</p>
<p>The earth is vast</p>
<p>A gust of gray sand blew past, and the earth unfolded vaguely, the boundless earth developing in all directions.</p>
<p>The ground is full of deep yellow soil, as vast as the sea, the land stretching straight into the haze, as if connecting to the gray horizon.</p>
<p>Under the azure sky, the earth unfolded greatly and turbulently, the sun caressing the yellow mud tenderly. On the soil, in a winding snake-like path, traces of running feet have accumulated.</p>
<p>The earth recalls the past.</p>
<p>In the earth, the skulls of many ancestors have been buried and rotted, and in the soil, the blood and sweat of slaves for many years has seeped in. It contains the hardships of one year after another, costing the efforts of many serfs. Generations of people are buried in it, just like moths fluttering their wings, throwing themselves into the flames.</p>
<p>In the earth, the bitterness of generations of farmers has been buried. Farmers, laboring hard from childhood to old age, their blood and sweat flowed down day by day, like pearls, fertilizing the soil, cultivating the barren land into a hot one. The bodies of the farmers withered, but the earth gave birth to the fruits of cultivation. The farmers trembled and shoveled the mud, from dawn to night, from the bright spring to the cold and freezing sky. Their blood ran out, their energy was exhausted, until they collapsed painfully on the ground.</p>
<p>In the earth, ancient heroes also galloped on horseback, iron hooves trampled the mud and galloped past. Under the fluttering banner, strange soldiers on both sides went crazy and fought and killed each other. Purple-red blood flowed in the low-lying areas, accumulating into rivers, endless skulls exposed on the ground, the land was barren, until the serfs who were not killed and jumped out returned to cultivate the land, enduring generations of the same fate.</p>
<p>In the earth, the tears of sad mothers and women were also poured in, containing deep thoughts in their hot tears. They missed their children and husbands without any news. They lost their closest relatives, shivering in empty arms with heart-rending pain. Every day, hot tears dripped down, giving birth to wildflowers, and on every tomb, there were small wildflowers like specks of blood.</p>
<p>The earth is vast, as if there is no end.</p>
<p>The earth is like a vast, boundless cradle, where people grow up and die, and the earth is like an old grandmother, where children grow up in her arms, and then throw themselves into her wrist, burying their remains, everyone to the end--each one returns to the homeland!</p>
<p>The earth is silent, and when a gust of wind blows, the entire earth roars.</p>
<p>There was a time when the land was aging.</p>
<p>In the autumn season -</p>
<p>In the thin sunset, farmers girls, with blue floral headscarves, leapt vividly on the earth. Each one welcomed the wind, her arms constantly withdrawing, from her palms scattered grains of seeds. Their faces were full of the light of youth.</p>
<p>They spread seeds, their wide sleeves pregnant with wind, each one with sturdy chests, plunging into the gale, the headscarves fluttering, and each daughter of the earth was constantly stretching out her beautiful arms.</p>
<p>The barren land accepted and conceived.</p>
<p>The sky slowly dimmed.</p>
<p>A tramp immersed in darkness in the distance stared blankly at the farmers women active on the earth, and he was deeply moved. His lonely heart was filled with a surge of energy.</p>
<p>He stared with widened eyes.</p>
<p>He prostrated himself on the ground in excitement,</p>
<p>In the dark, his mouth covered down, tightly against the deep yellow soil...</p>
<p>Kisses the earth reverently.</p>

<p>— By Gu Wenzong</p>
<p>Liya: Enough, stop making fun of me, I'm already feeling bad enough!</p>
<p>Jinghong: Alright, my little princess, stop feeling bad. Losing money and being cheated is just a one-time thing. What good does feeling bad do? If you ruin your precious health, that's no laughing matter.</p>
<p>Liya: I really hate the deceptive tactics of these merchants. They spare no expense to create deceptive advertisements everywhere. Look, wherever the railway passes, it's all advertisements. The advertisements in public places are even more eye-catching than in secluded areas. Especially in Shanghai, there isn't a single street without advertisements. The rooftops of those tall buildings are also provided to merchants as advertising markets because of the potential for profit. It's simply an advertisement world!</p>
<p>Jinghong: The more advertisements there are, the more it shows that the market is not prosperous. To have a prosperous market, of course, you need to use the power of advertising to promote and expand outward. I just mentioned it a little earlier, advertisements are not necessarily deceptive. Some advertisements are indeed proof of cheap and beautiful goods. Moreover, these genuine advertisements are easily obscured by false advertisements because merchants who deceive customers with false advertisements must make their advertisements more eye-catching than genuine advertisements. The wording of the advertisements is also newer than others, and the number of advertisements is relatively increased in terms of length and position, even extending to various provinces and counties. Therefore, genuine merchants, standing in a position of commercial competition, can never watch their businesses fail. Of course, they must also expand and enlarge their advertising efforts to make their advertisements able to compete with the other party. In this way, the commercial field becomes a battlefield! Trade becomes a commercial war. But once you become a merchant, you have to follow the way of commerce. Once we understand this point, we should be lenient and just let it go. Why get upset over these insignificant things? This is all my fault, I brought you out and caused you to feel so upset. Now, you just need to believe that the big dishes are completely British style, and that's all, stop doubting it.</p>

<p>Hu Zhangzhao, "Analects—Eight Rows"</p>
<p>Traffic (1300) 9:30 PM to 10:00 PM</p>
<p>Someone asked about the meaning of the Di sacrifice. Confucius said, "I do not know. He who knows its meaning would govern the world as easily as pointing to this," pointing to his palm. "Worship as if they were present; worship the spirits as if the spirits were present." Confucius said, "If I do not participate in the sacrifice, it is as if I did not sacrifice."</p>
<p>Wangsun Jia asked, "What does it mean to say, 'Rather pay court to the hearth than to the inner corner'?"</p>
<p>Confucius said, "It is not so. If you offend Heaven, there is nowhere to pray."</p>
<p>Confucius said, "Zhou observed the two dynasties. How rich and splendid its culture was! I follow Zhou."</p>
<p>Confucius entered the Grand Temple and asked about everything. Someone said, "Who says that the son of Zou knows ritual? He enters the Grand Temple and asks about everything." Confucius heard this and said, "This is ritual." Confucius said, "In archery, one does not pierce the hide; it is because the strength of the competitors is different. This is the ancient way." Zihua wanted to remove the sacrificial sheep from the announcement of the new moon. Confucius said, "Ci, you love the sheep, but I love the ritual."</p>
<p>Confucius said, "To serve the ruler with complete ritual is considered flattery."</p>
<p>Duke Ding asked how a ruler should employ his ministers and how ministers should serve their ruler. Confucius replied, "The ruler should employ his ministers with ritual, and the ministers should serve their ruler with loyalty."</p>

<p>Opening "Zhang Daoshi Sending Talismans"</p>
<p>The five poisonous creatures are all eliminated on the Dragon Boat Festival. Look at the crowds at the Lingxu Temple. The descendants of the two prefectures have all arrived. Zhang Daoshi welcomes them with a smile. Many carriages and horses are parked, and the crowd of tourists is dispersed. But see there, the twelve golden hairpins cluster around the stalls. There is also a Precious Brother in the middle. Grandma Shi comes to the palace with her cane. Wang Xifeng supports her from the side. The sisters worship Buddha and burn incense. But they hear the swallows chirping and reciting Amitabha. The people who enjoy good fortune worship and pray for blessings. There is no need for many offerings of incense and flowers. The opera is just starting outside. Zhang Daoshi respectfully holds up the spiritual talisman on a colorful plate. The toys in the plate are gold and silver ornaments. A jadeite unicorn is laid on a brocade cloth. He speaks auspicious and flattering words. Shenying hears and wants to reward the family slave. Fortunately, the nanny can forgive him. She picks up the unicorn and rewards him. Zhang Daoshi represents and asks to see Precious Jade. He picks him up and shows him to the crowd for admiration. After seeing Precious Jade, everyone praises him. Unfortunately, Shenying is possessed. He swears that he never wants to pass by again.</p>

<p>Opening "Climbing Mount Tai"</p>
<p>Mount Tai, the Eastern Peak of China, is famous. It has been praised for generations as a scenic spot. The mountain spirit nurtures the beautiful cliffs. Leisurely clouds and wild cranes form shade with the trees. The Tai'an Dai Temple is majestic. The Han cypress has stood for thousands of years. Climbing the mountain temple takes several miles. The Daizong Archway stands tall on the mountain screen. The White Crane Spring flows without a leak. The Jade Emperor Pavilion and the Cave of the True Man. The Wuxian Tower is surrounded by incense. Yellow tiles and red walls straddle the road. The Doumu Palace is praised as beautiful. The nuns are also charming. The Water Curtain Cave, a thousand veins compete to flow rapidly. The South Heaven Gate, a misty waterfall approaches. Listen closely. Turn east. The poor mountain people chatter incessantly. Tourists spend generously. The Two Tiger Temple. The Middle Heaven Gate. The climb to Dai has already gone halfway up. Food stalls sell food. The food is satisfying and without meat. Pass the happy three miles road. The winding path is like the road to Shu. Walking gracefully by the Cloud Step Bridge. The waves splash and ring like bells. The First Emperor Qin enjoyed the rain here in those years. The remains of the Five Great Men still exist in the Jianyi Pavilion. The pine mountains, pairs of Qin pines salute each other. The trees extend along the road, green and green. The Eighteen Bends, winding and difficult to step on. The stone steps on both sides are densely layered. The South Heaven Gate is built along the mountain. Shops line the Heavenly Street. The Bixia Palace of the Song Dynasty is large. Bronze tablets and stone tablets are lined up on both sides. The Jade Emperor Peak rises above the clouds. Ten thousand books come to court, only I am supreme. Climb to the top of Mount Tai. Look far from the Fengshan Terrace. The Qin Emperor was unkind and burned books, and the wordless monument stands at the top of the mountain for thousands of years. Look east at the sunrise from the Sunrise Peak. The Moon Peak, faces west and the moon is bright. The Cliffs of Sacrifice, the walls of the cliffs are dangerous as if walking on thin ice. The Old Man Peak, crouches and stands like a human. The scenery of Mount Tai is endless. The snow should remain in spring. Enjoy the journey and leave footprints.</p>
