<h3 id="c5">所得稅定期實行 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>— 柳</p>
<p>所得稅暫行條例施行細則。已於前日政院通過。該條例第二類之公務人員薪給報酬之所得。及第三類公債及存欵利息之所得。先自二十五年十月一日起徵。其餘各項。均自二十六年一月一日起徵。久未實行之所得稅。而今竟得實現。不能謂非我國稅制上進步之一端也。</p>
<p>所得稅之所以亟須推行。其用意固在擴大財源上之收益。要亦因直接徵稅。為節制資本之一道。乃中山先生所主張者。惟是中國迄今可云尙無大資本家。有之大都從販賈經營得利。而托庇於特殊勢力範圍之內。移轉隱匿。甚為便利。若此少數之可謂為富商者。有法規避。則所得稅之負担。全嫁於一般薪工階級之身。殊失節制資本之本旨矣。</p>
<p>公務人員及存息徵取所得稅似屬易行。惟公務人員原有所得捐以供黨務費之用。加徵所得稅。於負担能力上。不無考慮之餘地。至就存息而言。則外商銀行林立。擁有資財者。大都存儲於此中。徵稅殊多困難。而在華商銀行方面。如僅就華商存戶徵之。則存戶不難化名而為洋商。如併洋商而同徵之。其弊可杜。而其事較艱。蓋有不平等條約在。一切興革。有時竟無從談起。事實如此。不能無此顧慮也。</p>
<p>社會問題之解决。須根據事實。不能單憑學理。近來各種事業成效未著。大半坐單憑學理之弊。而稅制之整頓。一方面固為培養民生。一方面允須顧全民力。蓋民生於今憔悴極矣。休養生息。急不容緩。雖所得稅取之於有所得之人。而年來各人所得。亦有遞减之趨向。尤其為一般定額收入之階級。所得如舊。而支出已增。此其間困苦艱難。有難盡述。故所得稅施行之初。得寬大處仍以寬大為宜。無拘拘於收入之多寡也。</p>
<p>一新稅之推行。不能無隱匿。自不能無舉發。卽此一端。已種糾紛之因。現在所得稅全部實行。尙有四月之久。深望於此期間。籌畫盡善。凡認為足以有擾民之虞者。宜先事防範。卽弊之所不可避免者。亦當以組織之功。减至絕微。務使民間盡知新稅之當納不以為繁苛。此亦為政以德之道也。</p>

<p>我們現在對廣東政治和社會、先就最急要改革的來說、務必首先辦到下列三件事、第一要剷除貪污、第二要禁絕烟賭、第三要解除與民爭利、先就第一點說、廣東過去政治的貪汚、是大家所痛心疾首的、苛捐雜稅、重重疊疊、公家所得有限、人民受苦無窮、以後必須在人格上獎勵廉潔、在政治上减輕負担、用嚴格的法令、來懲治貧汚、一定要使弊絕風淸、苞苴絕跡、走入光明進步的政治、關於這一點、和用人有很大的關係貧汚之所以不能剷除、多半由於各機關用人不自由、在革命的政治上、有所謂肥缺瘠缺、本來是一伴可恥的事、而這種肥缺、每每由黨部和軍隊有力者提人保荐、如此不但主管廳處各機關、不能執行整頓、而且腐敗的政治也由此而起、以後不但各級軍官、不可向黨政機關隨便荐人、就是黨政負責同志、也要確守權限、不可以向同級或下級　機關隨便荐人、總要使主管的人、能够完全負責、而後上級纔可以切實監督、使政治日上軌道、譬如中正現在担任行政院長、除了我職權所在　照例委派以外、就不曾向各部推荐一個人、完全信託各部會長官、依照銓選規程、負責任用、但對於失職的人、卽加以監督制裁、總使所屬各機關長官　能完全負責、不加以牽制干涉、此為做上官者　所必須遵守之原則、亦卽政治上成功之要訣、總之我們要各自認淸權限與責任、絕不去侵犯上官同級　或部下的權限、纔可使政治淸明、要知道　親戚朋友如眞有學問經騐資格的、卽不保荐、也當然有服務的機會、這是造成廉潔政治的根本、其决便要執法無私、遇有貧贓舞弊的、一定要盡情懲辦、這一次中央派來的軍事　財政黨務負責人員、尤其應該為一般表率、如其有營私舞弊的情事、中正一定負責從嚴懲處、一概以軍法從事、現在就要由行營　設一吿密箱、如中央人員、有營私舞弊、在人民均可投遞報吿、但告發人、必須有確實姓名住址、並且要有確實的事宜和證明、總之必使廣東軍事財政與黨務、成為全國的模範、决不許有絲毫之徇情、第二點我們必須竭全　力來禁絕烟勝、烟賭是革命政治上一個必須去掉的汚點、廣東今日還有烟館賭館存在、眞是本黨的恥辱、中央已抱定極大决心、不管財政困難如何、决不在這種害國害民的惡習上、謀一文的稅收、一定要嚴格的禁絕、因為烟賭不除、不但社會有害、弄得萎靡游惰、敗德喪身、而且軍風紀、也沒法整頓、所以今後無論政治上的官員、或者軍區官吏之考成、一定要視其禁絕烟賭是否　切實澈底為懲獎之標準、社會上也均應視為大敵、努力剷除、黨政軍全體一致、應以此為大事、要知吾人今日卽不能為民興利、亦必須消極的為民除害、第三點我們須力戒與民爭利、廣東過去借統制為名、把許多產業都用官　營的名目、來圖少數人的私利、這是絕對要不得的、我們革命政治要為入民造產、不是向人民奪產、更不是借官廳的成權　來和人民爭利、所謂統制也應當限於國防和經濟自衛、以及發展基本產業上之必要、並非像過去這　種掠奪式的辦法、所可稱為統制、所以今後我們　必須切實審查所有產業、一定要使人民利益不被侵犯、必須使國家社會人民均　得到利益、絕不能剝奪人民的利益以自肥、凡是違反此項原則的失業、均應取消、關於此層、有連帶關系的、就是我們要注意吏治、愼選親民的官吏、而加以考核、必須使專員縣長眞能負責解除　人民的痛苦、以上三點、都是目前最急要而必須　首先做到的事、其他政治上應興應革的事情、黃主席賢明公正、一定能領導我們所有同志、使黨政軍呼應一起切實做去、以期不負廣東民衆的期望、，以上說明、我們目前在消極方面、要努力的三件要事、除此以外我們必須注意的、須知革命就是在　實行三民主義、而主義的精神所在、就是總理從前　所諄諄吿誡我們的、必須恢復民族的固有精神和道德、纔可恢復民族固有的地位、所以我們　必須遵奉總理遺敎忠孝仁愛信義　和平的八德、而在實行方面、無論黨政軍都要從「禮義廉恥　的精神做起、古人說「禮義廉恥、國之四維、四維不張、國乃滅亡」、雖是舊話、實在是革命治國之至理、所謂「禮」、實在就是程序和紀律、「禮」不僅在形式、實際就是紀律、中國所以弄　到散漫貧弱沒有力量、受盡外國的欺侮侵略、便因為不知紀律的重要、沒有奉法守紀的精神、所以國家民族、成為無組織的狀態、我們要勉為現代的國民、就不可不恪守黨國的紀律、一方面能服從、一方面能負責、相維相勉、不侵不背、這就是禮的極至、所謂「義」、就是要大公無私、義之所在、生死以之、我們在黨有主義、在社會有正義、不推諉、不茍且、唯正義是歸、不畏强禦、不圖私利、像這一次余總司令　及空軍將士的歸命中央、就是發揮義的精神、至所謂「廉」、不事、必須澈底做好、但必須認識自己的地位，不侵人家的權限、古人說「砥礪廉隅」、就是確守嚴正界限的意思、所謂「恥」就是一種極深刻的覺悟、拿廣東來說、鴉片貪汚嫖賭、就是有形的恥辱、古人謂「辱莫大於不知恥」、因為有恥前不知恥、所以因循玩忽、熟視無覩、最後必貽莫大的恥辱、推而廣之、我們革命為什麽到今天還沒有成功、國家為什麽弄到這樣　屈辱痛苦的境地、都是我們黨員官吏軍入不可湔滌的恥辱、能知恥便能力行、　能知恥必不卸責、所以我們黨政軍同志要湔雪以往　的汚點、光大以後的事業、必須以身作則、以禮義廉恥之四維自勉、凡是合乎禮義廉恥的事、要不顧利害的去力行、違反乎禮義廉恥的事、無論刀鋸在前、利祿在後、也必須避之若浼、這一次廣東革命將士、已把革命精神恢復起來了、今後的問題、在於如何把握這個有希望　的時機、發揚已有的光榮、完成革命的事業、要達到此目的、必須先建立有主義、有責任、有紀律之黨政軍機關、而首先要我們黨政軍各同志、掃除驕奢淫佚浪漫貪汚的頽風、發揚刻苦耐勞樸實剛毅　之正氣、簡言之要樹立起獨立不移完美無疵的人格、以身作則、來改造風氣、振作人心、不但我們自己要澈底改革過去不良的　習慣思想和行動、而且必須使我們的革命軍隊、成為人民的模範、使我們黨部成為革命的中心、使我們的政府、成為廉潔有能的政府、不論上下機關人員一致養成嚴而且正的　風尙、不惟待下以嚴、而且要治己更嚴、不但律人以正、尤其要律已以正、必須這樣、纔能担負革命的重任、完成吾人共同的使命、希望大家共同勉勵、互相監督、如果中樞律己、果有不正不嚴的行動、任何同志　皆應以黨紀國法先來懲處、如果中正有違反革命主義、任何同胞與部下、皆可以叛逆相待、我們為甚麼再以紀律和嚴正兩個字勉　勵我們的同志呢、要知道我們的國家正在監到　空前未有的國難、我們革命正在成敗的關頭、大家决不可有絲毫隨便放鬆一些、否則民族永不能復與、國家必不能存在了、臨到今天的盛會、我們不由得想到過去種種、過去廣東種種變化，其實也並非作亂者本性如此、我上面說過我個人實不能不任其咎、最大原因、卽由於我當時未曾以革命大義和正道、很嚴正的吿訴他們、也不能以嚴格的態度監督他們、所以有人說廣東連年紊亂、實由於中央的過度放任、因為放任慣了、久而久之、漸漸養成惡習、最後幾不可救、不但害地方、害國家、而且實際也害了部下、我想到從前在廣束負責的如李任潮·陳眞如·乃至如陳伯南·如果恪守黨國紀律、一一遵循正軌、何嘗不可以為　國家為革命之很大的功績、祇因中正誠信未孚、中央放任太過、以致他們誤國而自誤、實在是痛心、這，不僅是他們的過錯、亦是中正的過失、今日回到廣州、撫今思想、痛定思痛、實在是慚愧負疚之至、所以我今日呈請　中央赦免李陳及其附從的部下、而要自請處分、我們以後要使同志成功立業、不可不愛人以德、以嚴正的相期、要知道嚴正與苛刻有分別、干涉行動與束縛行動、亦有分別、限制自由與剝奮自由、更有分別、我們過有同志不正當的地方、干涉他、規正他、乃正是成全他、關於黨國最高利害的所在、以及紀律規則上之所不許我們限制他、實在乃是保障他、一軍人官吏黨員無自由、只有國家有自由、　總理這一個寳訓、實在是千古不易的定例、一日不限制、日日放縱、最後卽走上危險之路、而失了保障、一處不干涉、則處處越軌、必至不克全其始終、越軌與放縱、久而久之、卽可為造成作惡之階、所以我們黨政軍的同志們、為要保持上下始終一貫　之歷史與事業，對自身木可不嚴守紀律、時時戒懼、對同志同時亦必須竭盡職責、不可有過而不規、有善而不相勸、尤其是在上官左右、有扶持事業　成敗之責任的負責同志、更應當澈底瞭解、這個意思、君子愛人以德、故對上對下、皆應以主義與道德為標準、不可急於近功與小利、以淆惑上下、失了革命的立塲、我們旣然是死生休戚、共同一體的、就應該榮辱毀譽、也視為一體、在此基礎重奠之際、為期望革命和大家失業的成功、所以特別提出來、剴切相吿、相信我們在塲的文武同志、必定能接納這一番的苦心忠言、特別是愼終於始、於此還有一點很重要的意思要說一說，就是廣東與中央的關係、無論東、中興於廣東、將來也必應廣　東的力量而達到最後的成功、這是廣東特有的責任、也是廣東特有的榮譽、廣東民衆對國家對革命的貢獻、是照耀萬古的、也因為這一點、所以廣東和中央、决不能有分別、要知道無廣東卽無今日之中央、如無中央亦不能有今日之廣東、所以中央如果有力而穩固、就是廣東的福利、反之中央如失敗、亦卽是廣東失敗、就是整個革命的失敗、廣東與中央　榮辱利害得失、是完全一體的、今日的中央政府、雖然在南京、而精神完全在廣東、以黨務而論、廣東的黨員、數量超過於任何省份、所以廣東同志的任務、特別重大、格外要自重自愛、繼續總理遺留的精神、完成革命最後的任務、中央不能沒有廣東、廣東如離開了中央、亦必然陷於失敗和痛苦、中央成功了、廣東也成功、從前廣東當局不知此義、如李任潮陳眞如陳伯南等、以為沒有中央、廣東也能存在、沒有中央來統　率廣東的軍隊、也能獨立存在、這是很大的錯誤、須知革命全在基礎鞏固、中央就是鞏固革命的基礎、若是祇有手足而沒有首腦、則他的精神便無所寄託、試問如何能存在、所以中央和廣東不能分的、而中正與余主任·黃主席·以及在粵陸海空軍的同志、關係亦是一樣、亦是不能分的、今後萬萬不　能有彼此分別之見、廣東的一般同胞同志、以及軍人都要知道這個意義、廣東統一了、當然是中　央的力量增加了、但須知道這就是革命基本穩固、實在就是廣東的福利增加了、無論對人對事、對經濟關係、今後决不可有　中央與地方之分、在他省或者可以看作中央與地方是有區別的、而在廣東則中央與地方、完全是一體、大家澈底認識這一點，廣東前途的光榮、必無限量、中國革命前途、也無可限量、總之這一次可說不　僅恢復了革命根據地、也恢復本黨從來革命的精神、由此更想到在過去割　據痛苦的環境中、許多革命同志、受盡壓迫、飽嘗犧牲、維持了一綫的正氣曰也更是値得我們追思的、這一次旣然有　這樣光榮偉大的成績、大家都要知道、這樣成績、得之甚難、失之則易、必定要戒愼恐懼、竭力保持、一反從前的行動思想習慣、澈底了解廣東的地位怎麼樣、責任怎麼樣、尤其是廣東軍人、格外要認識自　己的責任和地位、要知道創造新局的艱難、共同一致保持現有的事業、並且努力發揚光大、使廣東在以後革命歷史上、盡到最大的責任、希望我們黨政軍負責各同志、從今日起、特別要精誠團結、和衷共濟、耐苦耐勞、共同一致的來努力、對自身則修養革命者偉大的人格、為廣東建設成一個模範省區、造成健全黨部、樹立廉潔政治、以鞏固我們　革命的根據地、恢復本黨革命歷史的光榮、這樣纔對得起廣東全省的同胞、不辜負全國人士的期望、也所以吿慰我們總理在天之靈、（完）</p>

<p>粵人楊文道、以有殺害日本水兵中山秀雄之關係、業與葉海生·周社榮·等同被捕房拘解第一特區地方法院、迭决開庭審究、因楊對於其家內搜出之藏置手槍書籍一册、始則承認係彼所有、繼忽堅稱乃其族人楊建中栽贓陷害、而楊建中遂成為是案之重要證人、法院特令捕房査傳其人、以憑質證、因建中早已離滬、致文道所供</p>
<p>栽害之詞</p>
<p>是否實在、迄難獲得相當證明、迨至前日、楊建中竟自投捕房、聲明彼願到案對質、遂由第一特院簫燮棻推事於昨日下午二時、續開調査庭、唐檢察官亦蒞庭執行執務、日方仍派軍人到庭旁聽、楊文道之辯護律師唐懷羣·郭啟明·亦相繼出庭、因祇審究書籍一點、故僅將、楊文道一名、由捕房</p>
<p>押解到案</p>
<p>當由捕房律師汝葆彝稱、本案被吿楊文道、對於從其家內搜獲挖有藏置殺害中山秀雄手槍之洞之書籍、於第一二兩次提審時、承認該書係彼所有、書內之洞、確係藏槍者、及證捕房騐明該洞所藏者、卽為殺害日水兵之槍、楊始於第三次受鞠之際、變更前供、謂搜出之書、乃楊建中</p>
<p>潛自棄置</p>
<p>其家、栽贓誣害、然此語彼迄未能證實、茲幸楊建中昨已自投捕房、據稱渠與文道雖屬同姓、實非同宗、文道之件處渠向不知、焉能往其家拋贓誣害、自文道被捕、渠屢遭恐嚇、為避免危險計、故離滬他適、惟思此事殊非久避所能了結、渠乃</p>
<p>毅然出首</p>
<p>俾明眞相、今已將楊建中帶案、請求訊究、庭上卽向楊建中訊據供稱、五十三歲、現住老靶子路鴻安里三百七十七號、與楊文道則遠在七百年前為一家、因彼此同屬北山楊族、旅滬同鄕會會員、故而相識、我呼其為叔、自去年八月間、在文道所辦之同仁協會晤面後、從未相見、倘我曾　其家、則其家人當然識我、儘可</p>
<p>傳來指認</p>
<p>庭上旋以在文道家搜出藏槍之書示之、建中視後答稱、此書向未見過、更未授文道於書內挖洞藏槍之法、並謂我已有幾萬家財、何需向文道吿貸云云、質之楊文道供、二十二年十月間、我在太古棧房、建中來訪、適我以所置手槍無處妥藏、建中卽授我藏槍之法；謂於書內挖洞而藏之、最為妥善、其時建中衣中衣、戴呢帽、非如</p>
<p>今之西裝</p>
<p>我與彼分屬叔姪、何忍誣之、庭上爰向建中繼續研詰、據供與醫生鄭惠民相識、四月十八日、鄭來北山同鄉會、見會員中有楊文道名、卽鮑我知否文道住址謂捕房欲覓文道、談話時、另有會員楊桂楣者、遂書文道住址於香烟牌上而付鄭、嗣鄭又來訪我、謂曾按址前往、詢悉文道不住該處、我乃引鄭赴楊桂楣家、由彼等</p>
<p>自行探訪</p>
<p>當鄭初詢我時、並未許我如獲文道踪跡、則給酬報、亦未說明覓文道之原因、嗣文道被捕、我見報方知、不料此後對我之空氣、日益惡劣、故得去粵暫避、回滬後、復歷遊京·杭·各處、現以此事若不使之明白、旣</p>
<p>有礙名譽</p>
<p>尤難營商、故特投案云云、但楊交道則稱楊建中會對楊桂楣言、捕房緝拿甚緊、並着桂楣前來通知速行逃避、而楊建中對文道所供、則矢口否認、於是兩楊遂面質一過、簫推事以關於此一部份、已經調查有相當結果、遂宣告退庭、楊文道仰仍帶回捕房收押、楊建中由捕房指紋處依法警取其雙手卞指之模候核、</p>

<p>（上海工商業槪况之卅四）</p>
<p>四·藝華公司—該公司成立於民廿二年九月，設廠址於康納脫路一一〇九號，係嚴春棠等所合夥組織，嚴任經理，從事攝製聲片，該公司歷史雖短，但以出品精良，故能博得社會好評，每片所耗成本常達四五萬元，其出品共有「肉搏」「女人」「烈燄」「黃金時代」「人間仙子」「飛花村」「凱歌」「時代英雄」「逃亡」「中國海的怒潮」「化身姑娘」等十餘部，該公司基本演員較少，大多臨時向他公司借用，其薪金以拍片一部，致酬若干為準。</p>
<p>五·新華公司司該公司成立於民廿四年，係共舞台主人張善現等所合夥經營，初時無基本演員，導演演員偌訂一部或數部片之合同，其出品亦非常審愼，內容頗佳，已問世者有「紅羊豪俠傳」「桃花扇」「長恨歌」「桃源春夢」等四部，尚能賣座，張君以共舞台所得，為該公司週轉資金，故經濟情形頗佳，聞現已聘胡萍，童月娟，等為基本演員云。</p>
<p>五·快活林公司司該公司成立於民十九年，係張丙生邵莊林等所創設，張為經理，範圍頗小，每年僅有出品一二部，因是社會不甚注意。</p>
<p>七·上海公司—創立年份頗早，曾一度併入聯華，廿三年始又獨立，現從事攝製聲片，範圍不大。</p>

<p>上海之影片經理商，幾全數均為外人，國人所經營者僅華威貿易公司，友聯影片公司兩家，外人經營者，尤以美國公司勢力最大，以其電影事業最為發達所致。今分述如下：</p>
<p>甲、華資創設者：</p>
<p>一、華威貿易公司—該公司成立於民十八年三月，資本五萬元，設於仁記路一一九號，係明星公司高級職員所合資，由張石川，周劍雲二人任經理，經理滬上各公司出品，以明星公司出品為主，每年營業額約百萬元左右。</p>
<p>二、友聯影片公司—該公司、係徐碧波所創辦，公司地址原設自　思威路，一二八前亦製片，曾有出品三十餘部，一二八之後，攝影塲被毀，股東無意繼續，現該公司專事經理過去本公司出品，故營業範圍頗小。</p>

<p>程大使演詞</p>
<p>主席各位女士各位先生、今日中國留德學生會開會歡迎戴季陶鄒海濱王儒堂先生、和世運代表團各位職員、蒙德國來賓惠然肯臨、吾人非常愉快和榮、</p>
<p>世運會本屆為第十一次、但在柏林舉行則為第一次、而本　規模之宏大、籌備之週密、參加單位及選手之數目、均超歷　而過之、阿靈匹克村對各國運動員招待之週到、尤無微不至、足見德國政府及人民對體育之重視、及辦事之精神、使外人來觀光者、異常欽佩、中國參加世運會、此為第三次、但第化屆僅有職員、第十屆僅派選手一人、尚係旁觀性質、本屆則有男女選手七十人、職員二十七人、國術表演員九人、體育考察員三十六人、總數達一百四十二人、總領隊為前外交部長王儒堂先生、國民政府且特派戴院長李陶先生參加、以示隆重、實空前所未有、中德兩國目十九二一年訂立新的後、邦交至為教睦、今世運會在柏林舉行、而中國卽大規模正式參加、更可表示對德之好感、德國近年來處處表現蓬蓬勃勃之新精神、而中國近年來由蔣院長提倡之新生活運動、亦普遍全國、東西兩國、遙遙相應、中國代表團來德後、必能在運動塲上、在寄宿舍中、在一切公共集會塲所、對德國之新氣象、有深刻之認識、而德國人民當亦可由中華代表團之來德、而明瞭新中國之新生活、天放深信目經此會兩國人民必更能互相了解、兩國友誼、必愈形親善也、</p>
<p>吾人受世界大戰之痛苦、對於戰爭深惡痛恨、思所以消弭之、但一部份心理學家則謂競爭為人類天性、故除非改變此天性戰爭、恐終不能免、天放以為競爭固為人類天性、但吾人可設法使之出於正當途徑、而不必出於戰爭、如運動會卽為最好之競爭、方式蓋與賽者在定規則之下、作正當之比賽、不但不傷友誼、並可增進感情、中國先哲孔子、卽曾說明此理、謂「君子無所爭必也射乎」、現代之運動會、亦可謂為君子之爭、吾人如能專從事君子之爭、而廢棄野蠻慘酷之戰爭、則世界和平、可以永保矣、</p>
<p>戴季陶先生為首任國立中山大學校長、鄒海濱先生為現任國立中山大學校長、此大學不僅為中國最大之大學、且與德國有甚深之關係、蓋戴鄒兩先生對德國科學這發達、素極欽佩、故中山大學歷年均聘有許多德籍敎授、實可稱為溝通中德文化之一機關、此點足以吿慰於德國友人、且使吾人對戴鄒兩先生之歡迎、更具深長之意義也、</p>
<p>敬祝中德友誼前途無量、並祝諸君健康、</p>

<p>（四）（一）大會開幕前的柏林</p>
<p>由柏林寄到中國的信、每星期有兩次、航空信是星期一五、西伯利亞快信是星期二五、記者趕着再向國內寄一點報吿、芷是第十一屆世運大會閒幕的前夕、</p>
<p>整個柏林市、為了這次大會、眞足陷入瘋在的狀態、無論走到什麽地方、看到的總是大會的標識、無論遇到什麽人、談起來總是關於大會的消息、柏林市的人口、原來祇有四百萬、可是這次從全世界各地來參加或參觀大會的、竟達八百萬人、超過原有人口的兩倍、因此把繁華的柏林，益顯得熱鬧擁擠、</p>
<p>柏林的市政在全世界的大都市中、本來是占首位的、這次因為整飾市容起見、把所有的建築物都加以粉刷、煥然一新、益顯其淸潔整齊、馬路上除掉不時　落戰片枯黃的落葉外、眞是一塵不染、所有機關商店住宅鬥前、都掛着紅底白圈的　字旗、和白底五連環的大會會旗、大一點的建築物的前面、所掛的旗幟、有五六丈長、隨風招展、氣　寓千、把整個柏林市、充滿了熱烈緊張的情緒、</p>
<p>大會會塲、奧林匹克新村、和女子宿舍前面、每天都聚滿了觀衆、每一國的外國人、走出來的時候、不論你是選手是職員新聞記者、都有許多人包圍你、替你照相、請你簽字、在街上走路的時候也是如此、甚至有許多七八歲的小孩、也拿了一本紀念册、一枝鉛筆、拉着人簽字、那副天眞爛漫的憨態、眞是可愛、德國人對大會的在熱、從　一點也可以看出來了、</p>
<p>二十九日德國的拳擊家希滿林Max　Schmaling去參觀亞林匹克新村、一進大門、就被幾百個的拳迷包圍起來、所有的照相機、都集中在他的身上、希滿林自從擊敗了美國黑色爆炸機喬路易士後、已成為德國的民族英雄、當他奏凱的消息、由美國傳到德國的時候、德國元首希特勒宜傳部長戈塔爾、都去電道賀、他由美返國的時候、更受着熱烈的歡迎、柏林各家電影院開映他和喬路易士比賽的電影、直到現在還沒有停止、僑居在倫敦的美國飛行家林白大佐、也到了柏林來參觀大會、他和希滿林一樣成為大衆談話的資料、</p>
<p>大會一切佈置、都已就緒、祗等着明天下午正式揭幕、德國人辦事的有秩序、有條理、眞是值得欽佩、我們可以用八個字形容他、就是「無人無事、無事無人」、無論在什麽地方、我們决不會看見掛着微章而不做事的人、無論有什麽事情、也决不會找不到人接治辦理、因此各國選手職員和新聞記者、雖然到了一個人地生疎的地方、都不感覺到什麽困難、</p>
<p>專為大會而來的各國新聞記者、一共有千二百人之多、其中日本有七十二名、被正式承認者二十七名、大會設了一個新聞部、專門供給各國記者消息、新聞部裏關了一個大辦公室、每個國家都有一張桌子、一架打字機、供給發電撰稿之用、桌子上面揷了各國的國旗、秩序極為良好、大會會塲裏記者的席次、設在全塲最好的地方、座位前面、還有一條長桌、可以放打字機、裝這電話、電局郵局也附設在後面、凡是新聞記者所能得到的便利、他們已經是佈置得毫無遺憾了、每個運動塲上、都裝了很多的無綫電播昔機、以便各國代表向本國播放消息、播音機一共有四百多架、工作的人員一共一千多人、中國方面、由記者擔任、每天正午十二時起播音二十分鐘、與中國有關的運動節目、並可在比賽進行時隨時播送、設備的精良、也是無可批評的、德國宜傳部長戈培爾Dr．Goebbels於三十日下午八時、在德國動物園的大廳、招待各國代表領袖及新聞記者、到了一千多人、眞是一個盛大的宴會、中國方面參加者總領隊王正延、總幹事沈嗣良、中央日報儲安平和記者四人、大廳的兩端都設了樂隊、隨時奏着悠揚的曲調、參加的新聞記者、雖然都穿上晚禮服、但是仍舊脫不了那副嬉皮笑臉的本來面目、大家不分國籍、也不管言語能不能相通、見著面就拉手談話、把一座偉大的大廳、充滿了融洽和親密的空　、宴席很簡單、一湯兩菜、和點心冰洪淋、並不像中國那樣窮者極侈、就座後先由德國中央政府秘書豐克Funk致詞、次由世運會會長拉都CounldeBailet　Latour致詞、宴席將終的時候、戈培爾氏在全塲寂靜中起立致詞、輝煌的電炬、照耀得如同白畫、電影機和照像機、都對準了他開始活動、我們雖然不能聽懂他演詞的原意、可是這位三十八歲的靑年政治家、具有一副誠摯沉著的態度、和滔滔不能的口才、全塲掌聲四起、震耳欲聾、他能與戈林將軍同為希特勒的左右手、决不是偶然的、最後由國際體育記者協會會長比人博恩Victor　Boin致答詞、因為每决演詞、都要譯成德英法三國文字、所以當大家帶著笑臉走出大廳的時候、已經是午夜了、</p>

<p>棉市先跌後回、但市態仍疲乏、蓋以海外棉業狀况不振、國內氣候順適、各路新棉生產健全、收成大增、故多數心理傾向拋賣、午後市傳私人電訊、美棉有看漲消息、人氣激昂而回漲云、</p>

<p>— 禾湮</p>
<p>蠶絲為我國重要農產品之一，其產銷之盛衰，與國內農村經濟及都市繁榮，有巨大影響，然以有兩千餘年歷史育蠶產絲之我國，因近世以來，日本意大利等產絲國得技術與經濟上的改進，以及政府當局加以有効的援助，故其蠶絲之產銷數量，均能突飛猛進：日本生絲在世界市塲，更握有操縱生絲貿易之覇權，幾有獨佔之可能。（以佔世界生絲消費總額百分之七十的美國進口絲品中，日絲約佔及全數之百分之九十八）返顧我國，近年來絲業界埋頭苦幹，改良產品，雖不乏人，然已見諸實施而有成効者，尚在萌芽與推動期中。至於祇顧一時及一已利害，而使華絲在外喪失信用者，正大有人在，（此點指我國投機絲商，及不規則之出口洋商·如彼等購買次等絲品，調換絲牌，濫升品級，以博昂價售諸國外者）而此兩者綜合說來，其喘息於日絲威脅下之情形，完全相同，其至今尚不能有迅速而合理之改善，亦相同。茲以十一年來，中日及意大利等生絲產量，列表如下，以觀其各國生絲，各因其環境（政治的，經濟的，科學的）不同，而影響其產量之情形。</p>
<p>十一年來各國生絲產狀　况（單位一千磅）</p>
<p>（本表之統計數目，係根據美國全國紡織業同盟會所發表之數字）</p>
<p>就上表數目觀來，日絲每年平均產量，佔世界產量總額的百分之七十五。我國生絲產量，自一九二三年至一九三〇年，每年均呈逐漸增加之勢。然自三一年起，則突然减少，虽一九三三年又见稍增，但至三十四年又復下降。（计一九三一年较上年减少一百五十七萬七千磅，一九三二年更驟减至僅產九百〇二萬三千磅，一九三三年雖又增至一千〇八十二萬磅，但至翌年則僅產八百八十萬五千磅，較一九二九年產量，僅及十分之四）其銳减之驚人，與日絲產量年增之比較，尤不勝相形見拙。（未完）</p>

<p>— 季珍</p>
<p>法律失了功用，賢者才不得已　幹「路見不平，拔劍相向」的事</p>
<p>淸乾隆時，漳南有個窮秀才姓李名越尋，他從小便以敦品勵學出名，博得一村人的敬愛。那時考八股是讀書人的唯一出路，越尋十六歲老上秀才，心裏很高興的想道：「鄉里這樣看重我，我一定要為他們做一番大事業。我這樣年輕便考上秀才，努力下去，中舉人，中進士一定也不難的。科舉的路一走通，做了大官，為鄕里幹什麼公益事不可以？」誰知道他冉多讀兩年八股文，和對於世務認識深些，心裏又起了疑慮了，他常常自己問自己道：「我要為人切切實實做一點事情，應該求些實用的學問，如想改革社會，就該認識社會；想認識社會，就該多讀歷史。紫莊常有水息，想解除鄕里的痛苦，就該研究水利。其他如學兵，舉農，學工，學商等等，都是實用的學問，然而八股完全不講究這些。我今日專弄八股，將來卽使僥倖成名，做了大員，靠什麽來治世利民呢？……」</p>
<p>他想丟棄了八股，躊躇了許久，一時不能决，還是循例念念八股文，應應考。有一天，他的太太餓病了，他非常焦急，想借一升豆來煮粥給她吃，奔走了一天，隨處都撞釘子，到了黃昏的時候，空着兩手回來。他心裏很慚愧，在門外逡巡着，不敢進屋裏來看他的太太。但他又怕她眞會餓死了，不禁又惶急起來，背着手，跪對着門縫向裏張望。那時巳經是該掌燈的時候了，屋裏黑漆一團，什麽也看不見。他正在苦思無計的當兒，不提防有人把一堆煞東西，悄悄地放在他的手裏，等他回過頭來看，只見一個小影兒，閃進左隣去。在暮色蒼茫中，他還很淸楚的看見他雙手捧着的是五個白色的糕餅。他記着過去多决同樣的經騐，他馬上便知道這一次是什麼一回事了。原來他左隣有個賣糕餅的小孩，可憐他沒吃，常常把賢剩下的糕餅，再熱過送給他吃。這小孩是很聰明的，他曉得讀書人最講臉子，總是悄悄地的把糕餅送來，一放下便跑去了。越尋非餓到實在沒法時，他也不肯受的。常常是小孩悄悄的送糕餅來，越尋托他的太太悄悄的送回去。這一回他為着救他快要餓死的太太，他不能再講這一套了。他像得了百萬黃金似的，歡歡喜喜捧着糕餅推門進來。就靠道幾個糕餅把太太的命救回來了。</p>
<p>太太精神恢復過來，便對越尋說道：「你看，人家不過是個小孩子靠着賣糕餅，也能養家，也能帮助人。虧你是一個頂天立地的漢子，讀　了幾句死書，拿不得輕，負不得重，連自己也養活不了。我想這八股文章是害人的，不念罷了。老老實實種地，或者做買賣，才是正經。雖然說考八股，中了可以做官，但你不是說你不是想做官，是想救人嗎？不能自救，怎能救人？我不相信一個人未中前是一個沒用的人，中了就會變成功一個能者呢，你別自欺欺人罷！你不如睜大眼睛看看當今貴顯的人是怎樣的，他們可不都是從科舉出來的嗎？他們究竟幹了什麽？這不是路，你該死心了。」</p>
<p>越尋聽了太太的話，决心放棄八股，耕田養家。有空時，多找些實用的書來讀，學問果然是一天一天的精進了。但可惜國家定了這以科舉取人的制度，越尋短了這八股的敲門磚，也就一輩子懷才不遇了。取士無法，用人不當，老百姓吃了不知多少虧。國家雖有保護大衆的法律，但「天高皇帝遠」，迫於權勢，不見天日的小民，那裏呼籲得到。越尋是一個充滿愛世　情的仁人，看不過眼，往往路見不平，拔劍相看，在鄕里間做了許多鋤奸扶善的好事，因此大家都稱他做李俠士。他常常對人嘆道：「古之君子，愛人心切，所以立志不做良相，也要做良醫。我今日不忍看見人家吃虧，不能執法，只好任俠了，唉，這那裏是我的本心呢—我想救普天下水深火熱的民衆，我聽見一個人啼飢呼寒，都覺得是我的實任，可是一個俠士能幹得什麽出來呢？不知道我的人，還以為我是高興任俠，其實這是我不得已的不得已行徑啊！」</p>
<p>紫莊的人曉得越尋能保護弱者，替伸人寃，因此誰受了屆，誰就找越尋去。越尋常常穿着短衣褲，但着兩把刀出遊，威武之氣奪人，强梁看見也要喪膽的。越尋在鄉里幹了不少有聲有色的事，但以營救某寡婦為最動人。</p>
<p>紫莊有一個年輕貌美的寡婦，守着一個十四歲大的兒子過日，不肯再嫁。她的小叔貪內黃人侯六的錢，暗中把嫂子賣給他。等到喜轎來迎親，小叔吩咐來人先在鄰近的古祠裏躱着，自己回家托詞把嫂子騙出來。她一出來，躲着祠裏那幾十人也跑出來？她不知道是什麽一回事，嚇了一跳，急回頭返家，無奈大門已經緊閉了。她走頭無路，迎親的人便乘機把她抓來，强載入轎裏，圍押着抬走去了。她的兒子聽見這不幸消息，忙跑來搶救，但已經來不及了。他曉得衆寡不敵，追去也無非白送死，人不會搶回來的。於是他跑去找越尋，跑在越尋面前，痛哭求救。越尋愁着眉說道：『道件事不容易辦啊！那位侯六是一個勇士，而你的母親已經落在他手上，路途又遠，恐怕一時搶不回來。』寡婦的兒子，聽了　尋的話，死命跪着，不肯起來，更加哭得厲害。越尋心裏不忍，只得慨然答應道：『拯救你的母親，實在是我的責任，我一定馬上去。如果不能搶回你的母親，我也不生還了。』越尋說完，便出來召集他的黨徒道：『我在村裏，素來是以俠義聞名的。今兒有人在我們村友搶了一個婦人，而我不能救她，還算得什麽俠義？本來想替她去打官司，但是現在做官的都是混蛋，他們只知道貪　納賄，那裏會辦什麽事？而且來往文書要過省過關，移動一下就要幾個月，那裏來得及？侯六這厮，看見我們迫得他急，他會馬上成婚的。婦人和他成了婚，還要她回來幹什麽？那末，官司卽使打勝，也像敗了的一樣，有什麼用？我以為不如以武力生劫侯六，就是不能得到這婦人，把侯六綁回來，也能保全她。』衆人聽了越尋的話，都答應了，越尋便挑選二十七人同去。</p>
<p>侯六住在甘固，離紫莊二十里遠，越尋帶着衆人到了天黑才趕到來，找到侯六的家，督率跟從的人，推門直入堂上來。那時賀客滿座，大家都無戒心。興高采烈的喝酒，忽然看見越尋他們氣忿忿的拿着刀進來，大家都大驚失色。他們想圍攻越尋等，但手無寸鐵，不知怎樣才好。越尋睜大眼睛，大喝一聲，便把他們嚇退了。他們自相賤踏，狼狽到極，更無辦法。越尋忙乘機跑進新婦屋裏來我人。那時侯六已經把那婦人藏在草屋裏，正在找人來帮手抵抗越尋。不想還未準備好，越尋已經趕到跟前來了。越尋左手緊把着侯六的手腕，右手拔腰下佩刀來劫他，跟着大聲叱責道：『你不聽見紫莊有李越尋嗎？怎敢入我的村來搶奪婦人？婦人現在那裏？快交　出來，　則我不能　你了。』侯六顫聲答運：『我，我，我已經把她放了。』越尋曉得　六騙他，很生氣呌他的黨徒把俟六反　着手綁起來。才綁好，村裏的靑年，不知底細，聽見侯家有暴客，爭着盒兵器來攻打越尋。越尋看見聲勢洶洶，知道非兼賴智勇不能取勝，於是他吩咐他那二十七人開着他站住‘各拿着兵器向外，自己站着當中，拿佩刀放在侯六的頸上，對大衆聲色俱厲的說道：『越尋這次來，是不打算生還的，敢和我拼命的，來罷！』一面說，一面舉刀在侯六的頸上試一試，暗示着，『你們如有異動，我必先殺他。』大衆看見這可怕的情景，都嚇出汗來，遠遠站着，不敢相迫。越尋又問侯六道：『婦人在那裏？』侯六不肯說實話，越尋生氣，把侯六拖出來。還未走到門口，聽見那婦人的哭聲，越尋等跟着聲音在草屋裏把她找出來。於是越尋差那二十七人保衛着她向前頭走，自己拿刀驅着侯六隨後跟來。甘固的人怕越尋沒有一個人敢追趕來。越尋看見自己完全勝利了，不願過用威力，走到半道便放了侯六，對他說道：『紫莊李越尋，不是怕死的。如果你想報仇，明天我便在家裏等候你。』侯六唔唔啊啊，什麼話也不敢說，一得到自由，便當脫離虎口一般。飛跑去了。</p>
<p>夜深，越尋才回到紫莊來，把寡婦交給她的兒子，才散遣了衆人。當着寡婦的兒子往求越尋的時候，她的小叔怕越尋責備他，早就逃走去了。侯六受過這次敎訓，也就怕了，不敢再來和越尋結怨。從此紫莊有越尋一天，也一直相安無事。</p>
<h3 id="c190">喇馬克Jean　Baptisete　Lamarek（1744—1829） <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 寶</p>
<p>—一個勇敢的博物學家—</p>
<p>喇馬克於一七四四年生於法國宓卡第（Picardy）巴芷叮（Bazentin）的鄉下。他出自淸貧的世家，父親是一個武士。喇馬克有十一個兄弟姊妹，他自己是最小的一個，家裏有許多人從軍，他三個哥哥是軍人，長兄已於圍攻時很勇敢戰死的。喇馬克很小的時候便會對父親這樣說：「大哥哥為國家戰死，多榮耀啊！我要學效他，爸爸，他會帶着我一塊兒走罷？」父親眼圈紅了，說不出話來，心裏却决定要去學習僧道。不久便送他到阿門（Amiens）的學校念書去。他無可奈何地在那裏念了幾年書，常常背人掩卷幻想軍人的壯武生活，老是想投筆從戎去，再三寫信請求父親，沒有一次不是得堅决反對的答復的。到了十六歲那年，他得到父親的死訊，馬上離開學校，奔喪回去。愛親的熱情興死的恐怖，令他覺情着，人生短促，應該及時努力，準備一個光榮的死，更令他决志從軍。</p>
<p>那時波索萊（Besujolais）的聯隊正在威斯提法力亞（Vestphaha）打仗。喇馬克好容易得一封引薦的信，跑到那裏投軍去。隊長看見他是一個孩子，不把他放在眼內，但碍着情面不能不收容他，只得讓他人伍，跟着因為戰事，忽然緊急起來，他也再沒心注意到這個小兵了。晚上經過一塲惡戰，兩方面死傷了許多人。第二天，大家增調後方軍隊補充，又準備着大戰了。天剛亮。隊長跑到前綫來指揮，把昨夜力戰的兵士都調到後方去。他忽然發覺了喇馬克，很驚奇的問道：「小孩，怎麽你也在這裏呢？」</p>
<p>原來昨晚隊長把他交給一個排長排長不高興用一個這樣小的兵，暗地裏　隊長道：「幹嗎要收一個小孩入伍呢？你愛他，你當他做寶貝就得啦，幹嗎要派到我的名下來？」他忽然因恨而生出惡意來，說，「好，乾脆把他快一點弄死。　他有多大的膽兒？調他到前綫去，不用親自交戰，我想他就會嚇死的。」排長果然馬上送他到芷在交戰的前綫去。不想他一點也不害怕，在槍林彈雨裏力戰了一個晚上，第二天還勇氣百倍地站着最前綫，不肯退同來。隊長問他，他也不切實答隊長的所問，只堅留在前綫服務。他最後含着淚對隊長說道：「我出自軍人家裏，從小受過軍事訓練，隊長，請你相信我，就讓我在前綫服務！我不能讓我的大哥專美的，隊長，你是知道他死得怎樣光榮的！」恰好鄰時敵人又來挑戰，營裏吹着緊急集合號，準備打仗。隊長沒空多說話，不示可吾，使跑到前綫指揮去。喇馬克認為隊長已經默許了他，馬上跟着軍號集合，到最前綫抵抗敵人去。這一次仗，法國大敗，軍官幾乎全數戰死，兵士非常慌亂，不顧紀律的爭着退却，只有喇馬克所在那一小隊，因為看見他勇敢力戰，大家都留着前綫拼命抗敵。最後得到聯隊長的命令，他們才守着次序，一面掩護，一面退到第防綫來。隊長看見喇馬克這樣忠勇，馬上正式重用他。戰事不久結束了，聯隊開到摩拿哥（Monaco）駐防去。有一天一個新來的軍官，聽人說喇馬克這次勇放力戰的事蹟，高興到忘形，提着喇馬克的頭把他舉起來，不想竟因此弄傷了他的脖子，發了可怕的頸腺炎，使他不得不返伍到巴黎醫治去</p>
<p>病好了之後，他改行學醫，但因為太窮，要把大部分時間化去謀衣食，同時他一有空又喜歡到皇家花園去研究植物，盡讀那裏關於植物舉的書籍，結果他的醫學進步得反不如他的植物學。後來他又喜歡算樂，又想改行，但他的兄弟部勸他仍舊學醫，更令他不知怎樣辦才好。好在他在那裏遇着法國的大哲學家盧梭（Rousseau），盧梭帶他四處漫游搜集植物去。他受了盧梭的感化，决定放棄醫學，專攻植物學，兄弟們反對他，他也不管。漫遊回來，他便在那位著名的植物學家堡拿得許索（Beruard　de　Jusaieu）選了植物學一科，精心研究。</p>
<p>他在研究的過程中，過着很淸苦的生活。有些有錢有　的親戚可憐他，常常跑來勸他道：『喇馬克，以你的聰明，走軍界，走政界，甚至走商界，都很容易發達，得到名利雙收的，何必吃這樣的苦？一個博物學家不是容易做得來的，你已經苦幹了好幾年，弄到精疲力倦，還不能弄到一點成績出來，這就是以證明你不能成為一個博物學家。其實做一個博物學家，有什麼了不得？你索性死了這條心，跟我改行罷，我馬上可以替你我個好職業。』</p>
<p>喇馬克正在研究有心得的侍候，聽見這樣煞風景的話，不由得生氣起來，嚴辭拒絕道『謝謝您的好意，但可惜這不是您所能了解的，我是相信世界上最有趣味的學問是博物學，最有價値的人物是博物學家。我又相信如果我努力，我一定能成功一個博物學家。不過大器是要晚成的，越有價値的東西，越需要高貴的代價，所以我要把我全部的時間和精力來求我的學問。我甚至願為牠犧牲我的生命，受些窮苦，算得什麽？』人家看見他這樣堅苦力學，也就不再來攪擾他了。</p>
<p>到了三十四歲那年，他的法國植物誌（Flora　Franocie）一書出版，不久便風行　時使他成名了。第二年，他得到法王的賞識，被選做科學院的會員，後來又受委做皇家「植物彙集品」的管理員。他雖然得到很高的榮譽，但他入息很微薄，又要養活五個兒女，結果還是要過淸苦的生活。好在他富有耐苦的精神，能忍受一切困難，不斷的努力以求深造。一七九三年，喇馬克所提倡創辦的巴黎博物院成立，喇馬克擔任大家都不注意的無眷動物部管理，並且獨力從事研究。『有脊動物（Vertebrates）』和『無脊動物（Invertebrates）』兩術語是他發明的，一直通行至今日。喇馬克所研究的無脊動物，大部分未曾經過前人討論過，旣繁雜又紛亂，喇馬克費了八年的精力才整理出頭緒來，印行他的傑作有脊動物以外的動物的統計（Systeme　desAnimoux　sans　Vertebres）。因為他的努力，他的研究成績，一年一年的驚人，到了老年，他便得到圾高的聲譽，繼林耐（Linnaeus）做世界的大博物家了。</p>
<p>出版界</p>
<h3 id="c191">雜誌圖書劃一出售辦法及其他 <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— 陳忠顯</p>
<p>自從本年四月七日敎育部頒布了「敎科圖着及其他圖書劃一出售辦法」以後，出版界上似乎受了一些影響；本刊第五十八期，獨秀先生特地做了一篇報喜信的文章，認為「這是一個出版界空前的大變革」，「整個中國文化界開始大放異彩的前奏曲」。不錯，這傎是一個完美而且又澈底的方法！六月二日，於是執着全國出版界的樞紐的上海市書業同業公會，根據了部頒大綱，又重行訂定了十五章六十四條約實施辦法；而隔不了些時，接着新生命書局和開明書店，又在核减售價，公布書目；這樣的澎湃洶湧，個人私心竊喜，以為前途眞是有莫大的希望了。然而，再翻開了六月三十日的書業公會的公告，不幸得很，這十五章的大辦法，竟因「手續繁重」「籌備不及」，而展緩半年實行；雖然敎部所頒的大綱，仍然是功令所在，依然存在着。</p>
<p>然而，我們畢竟不能因為敎部辦法的反響小，或者因為展緩半年，而忽視這部頒的大綱，和公會所訂的辦法。何况這正是一個出版界大的改革呢！所以個人極願趁現在，把這兩個條文，擇要的談一下。</p>
<p>這部頒十條約要點（一）是書籍須標明定價；（二）敎科書應减低售價；（三）書籍不准有折扣；（四）已出版書籍，須减低售價；（五）預的特價最低七折；（六）規定同業圖書館學校出版者批發購單之折扣；（七）不准舉行廉價或贈書券；（八）滯銷污損書，得設廉價部發售；（九）外埠得酌加匯水運費；（十）違反條例者，予以制裁。</p>
<p>書籍之不標明定價，這在古書（綫裝書）為最多。元刻本，孤本影印，這給出版者很多賺錢的機會。同時，讀者往往因為不諳個中底細，常常化了高價而得不到好書。再有，因為不標明定價，遂使各書店常看他們的資本，定所要獲利率的高下，而定書價之貴賤；於是，讀者因此而無所適從，同業因此而互相競爭。所以敎部現在規定了道一點，確是根本的解决方法。</p>
<p>但，古書畢竟不像新書之源源不絕的出版的，何况有了定價以後，仍可以七折對折乃至一折七扣的出售呢？所以敎部第三條就規定了不准减折或抬高價格。這樣，不僅是購者感覺到莫大的便利；就是出版者，也正如上海同業公會所說：「或抬高定價，大打折扣；或巧立名目，標榜康價；引起同業間不正競爭，釀成無謂之糾紛與損失。」這種毛病，也可同時免掉。</p>
<p>然而，為了顧全事實，敎部又特訂了第五第八兩條；來便利新書的出版和舊書之脫售，這不能不算是顧慮商艱的周到；同時，也是出版業方面應有的補救辦法。所以上海同業公會所定的實施辦法裏，特地在七八九三章，把辦法詳細的規定。如每年次數的限制，和書籍種數的限制，以及地點，時間等等，都極其周到。</p>
<p>此外，關於同業批發這一點，是頗値得注意的。筆者以前，往往有這種經騐；譬如說商務出的一本什麽書吧，在總館裏，是照定價出售，而在共他的小書店裏，常有資到七折或八折的。總館之不折不扣。其目的在保持其信譽和牌子的堅老，母庸多說；然而從小店之　七八折，卽可推測他們同行問折扣之大，非五折卽六扣可知。再看上海公會所公布的辦法吧。第二章，同行批發酬勞；小學敎科書和無著作權之出版物，八折至七五折；中學敎科書，雜誌，及其他書籍，八五折至八折；預的書，特價書，預定雜誌，九折至八五折。從這一點上，我們曉得他們同行間的折扣，現在是來得小了；換句話說，就是以前可以拿七八折在小書店裏所能買到的商務等大書館的書，現在是必需漲價了。同時我們再看敎部第四條規定：「已出版書籍，因原有折扣而定價較高者，應卽由各該出版者核减，另定實價……」，不　得很，遵部而響應自動核减書價者，僅有開明和新生命兩家而已。商務之類大書店，從前可以七八折買得之書（在小書店）而現在因部頒辦法以後，（當然這類大書店是不曾核减售價的）倒反使我們一般購買者，增加了負擔，而書價反無形的增加；這一點，不能不使我們懷疑，敎都第二條規定：「敎科圖書定價，應以編輯印刷之成本為準，酌量訂定，務求低廉。」那末，素以出版敎科圖書著名的商務，中華，世界，乃至大柬，北新，也似乎應當稍减售價；否則，若仍照以前五折六折的出售，是不遵部令可知；再不然，就是想先闖過了這一個暑假，先賺一個現再說。在此地，我們不能不說六月三十日上海書業公會公告所云：「但敎育部令頒劃一圖書出售辦法十條，凡我同業，均應卽日切實遵照辦理，實為至要」，是多事！是白話！是議而不行！</p>
<p>敎部也知道這種辦法是不容易實施的；所以在第十條上，就規定了若違反規則，地方官廳可以有相當的有效的制裁；只可惜，這屬於地方官廳的制裁辦法，浚看到公布出來。雖然上海同業公會，特地立了第十四章，訂定了四項具體的懲罰辦法；然而又因故展緩施行。</p>
<p>現在，亡羊補牢，猶未為晚；希望敎部不妨三令五申，以底於成；同時更希望上海公會，不要半年以後，又再展期；而各地書業，都一致起來，打破這多年來出版界的積弊，而達到獨秀先生的「大放異彩」目的。那不僅是出版界的幸事，中國文化事業前途。也敢　保是有發揚光大的希望的。</p>
<h3 id="c192">簡愛自傳 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 陳友琴</p>
<p>英C．白朗底女士作　李霽野譯　生活書店世界文庫出版</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>這部簡愛自傳，是十九世紀長篇小說名著之一。以前不知我國有沒有人翻譯過，最近，我繼從世界文庫第四册讀起直讀到第十二册，總算把這部名著賞識過了。照世界文庫的版本，共印上四百二十頁之多，並且現在還沒有單行本，我怕讀過這部名著的人不多，所以想的略陳述一下，藉作介紹。</p>
<p>我認為這是極有價値也極有趣味的好書，雖然作者白朗底女士自謙為這是並無足道的樸素故事。她是以這部簡愛自傳成名的，但是當時她所用的筆名却是CurrerBell卡銳爾白爾，並不是Bronte　Charlotte白朗底卡綠蒂。這部小說　出版，頓時惹起許多讀者的欽佩，大家紛紛推測這位新進作者究竟是誰，但是白朗底到底沒有說出眞名來，她在三版小言中有這樣的聲明：「我要利用簡愛目傳第三版給我的機會，再向讀衆說一句話，解釋我有被稱為小說家的權利，全靠這一部作品。因此，若有別的小說作品認為是我所著，是將榮譽判歸不應得的地方了；結果，正當應得榮譽的地方却沒有得到。這解釋可以用來改正已經鬧出的錯誤，並且防止將來的錯誤。一八四八年四月十三日卡銳爾白爾。」從她自己這段小言裏，可以看到當時人對於這部小說是怎樣的重視了。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>關於白朗底女士的生平，譯者李霄野先生未作介紹，讀者們知道她怕的不十分多，所以特地在下面簡單的叙幾句。</p>
<p>白朗底卡綠蒂Bronte　Cbarlotle是她的眞名，她是一八一六年生一八五五年死的，僅僅只活了三十九歲。</p>
<p>她是白瑞克牧師的女兒，白瑞克帶有愛爾蘭人的氣性，並且天生就一種古怪的脾味。他敎育孩子的方法是極其特別的，常常要使孩子無受許多苦處。</p>
<p>從一個荒蕪村　接近墳地的小牧師住宅（HaworthParsonege）中產生出來，養成她孤癖的性情。並且在兒童時代，他就失掉慈母了，她因為年長，便不得不負起母親的責任，照管並敎育她的兩個小妹妹。一個呌做愛米雷，一個呌做安　的，終於得了她極人的帮助，也在文壇上享負盛名。（這些人物頗與簡愛自傳中幾個配角的個性描寫有關。）</p>
<p>經過許多努力，她曾當過學校敎師和家庭保姆，後來又和妹妹們糾資印刷了一些詩集，署名是卡銳爾，愛麗思，或愛克頓，白爾。（這和簡愛自傳的筆各稍有不同。）但是成績平平，未受多少人汪意與歡迎。（未完）</p>

<p>細胞實質的機能增進　是剷除全身淋毒恢復病灶組織的樞絲</p>
<p>讀者對於淋病治療之認職，當必有幾許經騐。蓋淋菌旣富抵抗性，而繁殖又速：才一傳染，即由尿道粘膜，侵入後尿道，未幾卽蔓延全身。其最著者，如淋菌性關節炎之致人殘廢，心內膜炎之頓死，化膿性骨髓炎之危殆，虹彩炎眼結膜炎之目育，其他尚有神經系疾患等。變症蠭起，不一而足。是豈局部之透膜殺菌，所能蕆事？此在用過透膜殺菌療法之慢性淋患者，即為明證。</p>
<p>因此，近世歐西著名學者，乃一反舊有迂拙不合理之學說，創立白血球增加療法leucocytosentherapie之偉論，而由彼得博士總其成。由是採取類脂及蛋白體，侶以純色素製為「克淋儂」。服後卽旺增白血球，使全身各部每一淋菌，樸滅無餘。而淋菌根斷矣！至於病灶方面，如急性時之前尿道，慢性時之炎腫睪丸，攝護腺，關節，及女子糜爛炎衝之尿道，陰道，子宮等，其壞損組織，得因「克淋儂」之增進細胞實質的機能，均獲全部恢復健康。此藥功能，實曠古所未有。其不敗胃及不含任何副作用，又遠出各種舊有及仿冒新藥之上，購服者所當再四注意「克淋儂」三字也。</p>
<p>余留俄十餘載，所治花柳病多矣，而以本藥施治男女淋濁白帶，收效之速，直駕乎六〇六之治梅毒而遠過之。偉矣哉！淋病療法之成功也！</p>

<p>— 武鐘麟醫師</p>
<p>女子月經，本是生理上之現象，毫無神秘可言。然若一但遠反生理自然法則，此月經卽不龍按期而至。經來亦有種種痛苦之症狀，其最大原因，為卵巢及黃體失常，而子宮與其他鄰接器官失常！亦能影響於月經。凡有此等月經病之女子，應宜矯正。以免病勢日進，而致摧殘受孕力，甚或因此成為子宮痛而致命。</p>
<p>據余多年來臨床上之實騐，凡為月經不調之婦女，尚有腰痠背痛，白帶下，頭目眩暈，心中怔忡不寗，食量不增，貧血等現象。其惟一適當之療治，可服女用荷爾蒙製劑「補女容」最為有效。因此藥有矯正卵巢子宮等器官不健全之能力，故月經因之獲得調整。而恢復健康與受姙力也。有康力　君夫人，結婚已五六年，素乏調整之月經，身體十分纖弱，迎風欲倒，故亦從未有生育之事。舉凡調經補血等藥，皆屢服無效。後改投余處醫治，診之乃卵泡刺戟素缺乏也。囑往中西藥房購服「補女容」，以增多其刺戟素，外用「卡氏陰道片」為坐藥，以淸除白帶，內外兼顧，雙管齊下，經過一月有餘，經水卽按期而通，體亦壯健，果於一年後舉一子，於知月經與生育上，及體健上關係之重要矣。</p>

<p>— 陳少華醫師</p>
<p>熱天流行之病患，以胃腸炎為最。良以居民喜啖生冷，不愼口腹，致胃腸機能損傷，於是發生劇烈之胃痛，嘔吐，身熱，倦怠，洩瀉，胸部飽脹，此為急性之炎症，宜速以「強胃精」消炎防腐，止嘔鎮痛，則腐敗食物，得由排泄而廓淸，胃腸之機能復常，即可無變症如胃潰瘍，胃癌，胃下垂及擴張等現象發生矣。</p>
<p>脫在急性時誤服麻醉製劑以止嘔瀉及鎭痛，則雖暫時獲效，亦必轉為慢性。慢性胃腸病之主症，合言之即消化不良，分言之：則有胸隔嘈雜，噯氣頻頻，吞酸作噎，見食即畏，食後脹痛隱隱，大便秘結，或完穀不化，糞溏，治之之法，以服「强胃精」為首。蓋「强胃精」主有此項複雜之效能。其配製則含有豐富之酵　，不特輔助消化，又能供給榮養。對於重症不復原之胃呆，小兒吐乳綠便，均極奏效！其於煙民胃弱便秘及戒癮，亦著卓騐。此因「强胃精」富含蛋黃素，足以輔助淸除血內之煙毒也。但戒煙最好同服「補體康」以根救其衰弱，而免宿疾復發。</p>
<p>「强胃精」又善治脚氣症，蓋其具有多量維他命B耳。其他因遺精之胃呆，或肺癆之食慾不振，除服强胃精」健胃外，宜兼服「育精片」止遺及「補體康」補精，或兼服「補肺拿兩」以抗菌除痔。中西永安及各大藥房均售。息者如法自療可也。</p>

<p>診所—寗波路四川路口　診時—下午四時至六時</p>
<p>醫治須有絕對之信仰與恒心</p>
<p>肺　之組織，與人體其他內臟不同。其細胞旣嬌嫩，絀於抵抗力，而又缺乏知覺，縱使內部潰爛，其人外表上亦無異狀。必致抵抗力衰退時，因菌毒隨淋巴流入血液，遂有盜汗潮熱胃呆等現象。不過亦有因人體强弱不同，而發現有遲早者。在余所經治之病人中，有半數肺內有空洞一二處，而外表全然不覺。惟以陡然咳血，或傷風咳嗽來余處診療，因而檢出其罹癆已閱五六年之久。此外，第一期肺尖加答兒之癆症，往往與傷風相似：卽咳痰頻頻，食慾銳减，身心倦怠等，此則可目為早發性肺癆。</p>
<p>肺組織一為結核菌佔據，即被其　食鯨吞，終至成為空洞。欲使之彌縫而就愈，惟有使用徒梅博士發明之「補肺拿爾」以增加結締組織，一方增强抗菌能力，則癆菌可以覆沒，空洞弭平矣。其於咳血潮熱，顴赤盜汗，痰稠胸痛，食减困瘦等，服之三四星期至八九星期，即可奏收全功。至兼有神經衰弱，健忘失眠心悸等症，男子可並服「補體康」（此兼善治腎萎，早洩腰痛。如罹患遺精精漏，宜合服「育精片」，一以治之。女子可服「補女容」（此藥兼療月經不調。如有體盧白帶，可外用「卡氏陰道片」）以治之。以上指定之彙，可向永安公司西藥部及各大藥房購嚴。簡時存絕對之信仰與恒心，則療患自可　滅無譽也。</p>
<h3 id="c197">可怕的重篤遺精症 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 南通醫科大學學士武鍾麟醫師</p>
<p>遺精得種類，可分為下列幾項：</p>
<p>（一）夢精　（二）滑精　（三）精漏　（四）早期射精</p>
<p>夢精是遺精症中，最普遍的一種。由淫夢而起。其病理為射精中樞過敏，生殖系神經衰弱。</p>
<p>滑精是無夢遺精，乃輸精管鬆弛，故遺洩時並不感覺。這兩種疾息，應向中西大藥房購服「育精片一以鎭攝神經，使射精中樞堅實，輸精管緊固。服三四星期，便可根本痊愈。如果服那些緩滯之普通製劑，或竟誤服劣藥，損傷生殖腺內部纖巧組織，或是延不施治，便陷入可怕的重篤症，成為精漏了。</p>
<p>精漏症往往進入色情在，一見異性，即發生極度衝動，精液　流。或大小便後。或用力之後，精亦漏出。由此招致早期射精—早洩和腎萎無力。這便必須同時以「育精片」鞏固精系，收縮攝護腺，而以挽救弱性能之「補體康」，並可合服。</p>
<p>以我的經騐，凡是遺精症，如夢·滑·漏·早洩各症，都應該用補體康合育精片「補」·「固」兼施。况遺精多由手淫而來，這二藥又是能制止手淫的。</p>
<p>他如由肺病所致遺精或由急性淋病所引起的，除照服此一藥外，當並服「補肺拿爾」治愈肺病·或「克淋儂」治愈淋濁。藥性都很王道，可以千萬放心施用。</p>

<p>由動物試騐到人體實騐</p>
<p>二十世紀醫學上最値得注意之事項，厥為內分泌學說之昌盛。蓋自十九世紀中葉德國倍多德氏發明內分泌學說以來，為期未及百年，其進步較任何科學為速，然在實騐方面，尚有不少缺陷者。其中獨德人梅倫氏之研究成績，最為卓特，氏所發明之男用「補體康」女用「補女容」二藥，係採取兩性壯勇動物內分泌分別製成，對於兩性發育不全之症狀，服之確具偉效。梅倫氏會將此種製劑，和入食料中，餧飼甲狀腺發育不良而佝僂之雄犬，（即圖中右側犬）繼續餧食至五十餘日，發育即有驚人之進展，大腿骨增長，腰身以至頭部，亦甚增大，姿態雄俊修偉，狀如猛獅·（即圖中左側犬）梅倫氏動物試騐旣獲成功，即作更進一步之研究，又經多年之試騐，乃用嚴密消毒手續，精製成功人類口服片劑。而應用於臨床上之實騐，遂獲最後之成功。於是「補體康」與「補女容」二藥，風行世界，為一般病家造無量之福星矣。凡先天發育不全與由後天手淫，房事過度，而來之發育不全，遺精早洩，頭痛失眠，記憶力弱，貧血，女子月經不調，乳房臀部發育不良者，分別服此二藥，功效無不立見。二藥國內各大藥房均有經售。</p>

<p>患者孫聲海君，年廿五歲，計患淋病已有六年，凡透膜殺菌之淋藥，及尿道洗滌等無不服用殆遍，而症象依然未减，且有增進之趨勢，來余治療時，已成慢性淋毒膀胱處炎，尿意頻數，淋系如絮，時浮游於尿面，沉澱物甚多，小腹作痛，經用膀胱鏡檢查，見其內部發炎紅腫甚熾。乃投以「克淋儂」以消炎殺菌，抗淋淸濁，計服至五星期後，炎消腫退，小便輕利，瑩潔與常人無異。更用籮微鏡檢查十數次，毫無淋菌踪跡，始證明根治。其夫人亦久苦白帶，亦由余指示外用「卡而雪地陰道片」為坐藥，內服「克淋穠」，一月後淋帶皆告全愈。</p>
<p>（療法評議）按孫君之病在急性淋時，如果眞有透膜殺菌之藥，國亦司取小小效，然一旦已成膀胱炎，雖有透膜殺菌之功，决難取效。因膀胱已炎腫，粘膜組織破壞，已無膜可透也。又治療此病，從前多用膀胱洗滌，但症狀既到此地步，洗滌已失效用。祝此種洗滌，往往將淋菌分散各處。為害益烈，余用內服藥之「克淋儂」，以消炎防腐，鎮痛除淋。故能在短期中根本治愈。此實為最平安而有效之處置方法也。</p>

<p>性神經衰弱原因殊夥，而大概起因多山手淫，房勞等所釀成，但淋病變為慢性後，亦易招致此病。此因淋毒侵犯淋系，刺激神經中樞，乃起過敏反應，如慢性淋之遺精，卽以此故，馴至陷於極度神經衰弱，所謂早洩是也，一身而兼此數病者，頗不乏人。而元氣為之消耗，身體因之衰憊，誠岌岌可危也，然臨床上此例甚多，實屬目擊心傷之事。</p>
<p>患者錢子樹君，性倜儻，好狎邪遊，終於受染淋毒，雖經多方醫治，表面上似覺已愈，詎未數月，厥疾復發，自後屢發屢治，且由慢性而發生精系炎，精液自遺，神情頽廢，幸其夫人善能諒解，深加寬慰，錢君尤為感動，第苦床第之樂，不能持久，幾於一觸卽發，又將此毒傳染其夫人。致患劇烈之淋毒性白帶，陰道樂爛過半，錢君益感內疚，服藥無虛夕，無奈病毒已深，收效匪易。由友介紹余處醫治，除行電療及X線療法外，囑往各藥房購服德國「克淋儂」及「補體康」。蓋「克淋儂」可以抗淋殺菌，鎭痛消炎，能直接在病灶上發生殺菌作用，更輔以「補體康」以鎭攝神經而促性腺之强化，俾性神經得以恢復原有健康，連服五星期即告全愈。曾經血淸檢騐，並無陽性反應。此為淋毒斷根之微，遺精之患亦同時治愈。共夫人白帶，亦內服「克淋儂」，外用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」為坐藥，至一月後亦全愈，偕居迄今未發。</p>

<p>— 曉明</p>
<p>全球猶太人大會閉幕了，我們看那大會的議决案，例如對於德國國社黨驅逐猶太人的抗議，請求蘇聯准許其境內猶太人自由信仰猶太敎，請求各國停止究辦猶太人的參加重建祖國的運動……等等，我們是能够相信，猶太民族是優秀的，至少不是如德國希特拉的黨徒所咒詛的那樣下劣。</p>
<p>而特別顯出猶太人的英勇的？是對於德國國社黨的嚴厲的反抗！他們號召全球猶太人抵制德國的貨物。作為是整個民族對於迫害者的答覆。</p>
<p>猶太人，一向是失却了自己的國家政權的保障，他們沒有團結，一任外族的歧視，因此往往召來無辜的欺侮。然而，這次全球猶太人大會的會議精神，是足以向世界無論是壓迫者與同情者宣告，猶太民族的團結的力量了。</p>
<p>在德國，自從希特拉上台以後，為了對外擴張其侵略外交，對內轉移民衆對於社會危機的視綫，將一切德國的貧弱的原因，全盤推給猶太人負担了。希特拉在「我的奮鬥」裏說過，德國的喪亡，創傷，完全是起因於猶太人的男盜女娼混亂了日耳曼民族的血統。因此希特拉反對布爾塞維克就對德國勞工說馬克思是猶太人，希特拉反對暴露客觀眞理的科學，就說愛恩斯坦是猶太人，希特拉禁止諷刺資本主義的影片，也藉口却利，卓別麟是猶太人…</p>
<p>總之，「排猶運動」已經成了希特拉多方面的手段了。因為是一種多方面的手段，所以受損害也就不祇限於猶太人本身，而是全世界愛好自　由文化的大</p>
<p>而在目前，這種對於弱小民族和民族文化的迫害，是有擴大開去的趨勢的，在奧大利，在美國，希特拉的羽黨也正醞釀着排猶運動。</p>
<p>正在這樣的時候，全球猶太人大會的召集是値得我們興奮和同情的。我們應該以同一被歧視的民族的名義，向勇敢的猶太人表示敬意，並希望他們閉會以後堅决的執行民族自衛的議决案。我們相信他們的行為是能够打出敵人的侮辱和獲取全世界愛好文化自由的大衆的擁戴的。</p>
<p>中華民族在希特拉的著作裏也是「劣等民族」，而與豬狗同列的，倘使我們的民族並不是？比猶太人更低劣的話，我們應當有什麼表示呢？</p>
<p>我們應該想想我們的地位和海外僑胞的待遇吧！</p>

<p>— 艾荼</p>
<p>來到廣州以後，人總是很夜夫睡覺的，似乎是我的流浪底慣性，在每個冷靜的深夜，街頭上已沒有了行人，只聽見那一套慣調的咚咚更鼓聲，一片廣漠的藍雲罩籠着大地，這時分，我很願意拖着疲乏的腿兒，一拐一拐的去流浪。一直到四更五更，有時還到了雄鷄喔喔的啼了，我才悄悄地踏上那古舊的樓台</p>
<p>南方的夏夜是這麽値得我留戀的，有時，我簡直像一個人間的探討者，在那陰暗的街頭好奇地觀察一切的，為了這，我就每個夜里都跟那許多許多的露宿的人們接近了。可是，這無數的露宿者，往往地佔有了整條馬路的行人路，有時在深夜，我送安妮回家去的時候，那無數的影子敎她們驚懼的。</p>
<p>「你看，我們的家門也沒路通行了！」那傢伙看見，一定又駡啦！」</p>
<p>這句話，假如是別些女人說的時候，我會斷定地是含了無限的僧怨，厭悶底氣味的，可是，誰相信安妮也跟那些貴婦人或小姐一樣的呢？不！我從這口吻里看得出她是含着無限的同情與悲嘆呀！因為，我曉得，她的生活是接近這些的，她雖然也跟所謂上流的小姐們交有時爭吵起來，又受到警察驅散了。有時，我們可以看見零散的，一個一個的流蕩的窮苦者，他們睜着眼珠子，從陰往，可是，她早就有這樣憎惡現社會的一切的一個女兒了。</p>
<p>我們的家門已給那露宿的人們佔有了，只還有半尺那麽大的空閒讓我們出入，有一天，我們的店主像發怒了的獅子似的在吆喝着，去呌警察來驅逐了：</p>
<p>一不成—在門口睏覺，像幾條死屍似的難看呀！」</p>
<p>他把那　得正熟的人們喝醒了，我們在後面眼瞪瞪地望着心里有點難過起來，當店主那麽神氣的在指手劃脚的時候，安　嘆了一口氣地說：「他也是窮人出身，一個沒家沒門的人，靠人家養大了，發了財就這麽神氣咧？」然而我們還有什麽話好說呢？眼瞪瞪地看着那些人們哀求：</p>
<p>「先生！詩頭！我們沒地方睏呀！」</p>
<p>「到別地方去哪！廣州這麽大！」</p>
<p>「別地方都睏滿了人咧！而且下過雨，地面太濕哪！你看，那宋騎樓的地方不好繭呀！」</p>
<p>「不成！我的門口不是你的家呀！你們像死屍一樣」</p>
<p>我看見這許多無辜的襤褸的人們在憤恨地走開了。</p>
<p>這樣，我總是在街頭上看見了無數的露宿的人們，他們沒有衣服，赤着脚，裸着腿，每個夜里都把馬路的兩邊佔有了，他們整天的飢餓着，沒有工作，像無數的蟲在落角里伸縮着，到了夜里，挨風挨雨，咬着牙根的去讓無情的蛟子刺吮那盆血的皮肉，可是，他們希望睡得快樂一點也不成呀！</p>
<p>我感到夜的街頭充滿的慘痛的影子了，我們兩個常常看到警察替店主人驅逐露宿的人們底悲劇，那兇惡的腿常常地光顧到他們的身上的，尤其是到了落雨的時候，他們都在爭搶睏覺的地方，暗的角落里探視著，像耗子似的，可是，到處都給別人睏覺了，他就會低着，腦袋，失望地又跑到別一個地方去了。</p>
<p>一個新的長官上任的時侯，第一步發下來的命令，這也許是他認為最偉大的奇蹟了，那命令的意思是這樣：「廣州有流民二萬，每夜在路頭露宿，裸臂橫陳，有碍觀瞻，而有不肯之徒，乘機擾亂治安，應嚴行禁止……」</p>
<p>這命令發出了以後，那一班警察老爺的棍子也忙起來了。</p>
<p>可是，這一條巨大的鞭子，像老虎地加到這二萬無家可歸的人們的身上，每個夜里不是還一樣堆滿了露宿的人們嗎？這，安妮有一天跟我這樣說了：</p>
<p>「眞怪，這班長官們，為什麽不懂得人家沒有地方睡的呢？禁止！難道政府有地方給他們睡覺嗎，呵！似乎要他們死了才對似的呀！」</p>
<p>我看見她在搖了搖腦袋，可是，我却不想說什麽了。（羊石散記）</p>

<h3 id="c207">露屍 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 休羊</p>
<p>那露屍是挑水阿根在河灘邊發現的。</p>
<p>挑冰在這鎭上是獨行生意，從阿根祖父手裏就靠着一種特殊勢力來霸佔着，所以他父親，阿根自己，他們的名字上都冠着他們的職業做稱呼了。</p>
<p>這鎭上的店舖，住戶，他們每天的用水都是阿根包着的，卽是做手藝的，在分不開手的時候，也得要阿根挑幾擔水的。</p>
<p>天色發白，阿根就一骨碌從床上爬起來，擔着和他相依為命的水桶到河灘去了，按着路遠近，他挨門達戶挑水去。那些店舖，住戶每天要用多少水，他都為他們裝滿了水缸，再加着短期生意，整個上午他幾乎沒有抽一支烟捲的閒暇。</p>
<p>那天他挑着水桶，唱着山歌，走到河灘邊的時候，他看見一具赤身露體的女屍擱住在河灘上。那屍體已經發胖了，天色又沒有大亮，阿根嚇得喊了起來。</p>
<p>沒有多少時候，河灘邊圍着不少瞧熱鬧的人了。也有人去喊了地保來，設法把那具屍首搬到岸上，用蘆柴遮了下體，一面由一個地保招呼來的人到大街小巷去敲鑼，要家屬來認屍。</p>
<p>來瞧熱鬧的人果然愈聚愈衆，但是沒有人來認屍首的。那具屍首呢，大槪在水裏浸得太久了，五官已經腐爛，沒有人能够猜想出她倒底是誰了。</p>
<p>下半天由地保到善堂去領了一具棺木，到義塚上去埋了。</p>
<p>這裏發生了吃水問題，大家眼看着一具腐爛了的屍首在河裏搬上岸，店舖，住戶都要阿根到十里外的大江去挑水，阿根當然提出反對的理由，他說：</p>
<p>「十文錢挑一擔水，要跑到十里外的大江去，跑一整天弄不到幾百文，誰願意幹！那屍首說不定是大江裏浮來的，那不是白辛苦嗎？」</p>
<p>用戶還是堅决反對，他們寗願不吃水，阿根也賭氣把水桶送回家裏上酒店去了。</p>
<p>酒店裏正把這件事做着新聞，老闆，店小二，酒客混做一堆議論着。阿根踏進店堂去的時候，因為他是發現屍首的，大家圍着他問東問西起來。</p>
<p>阿根今天做不到生意，滿肚子的怨屈正在沒有發洩的地方，他敲着桌子說：「哼，一具女屍就這末起勁，你們想入死×嗎？一面喊店小二打酒，接着又自語起來：「看他們好三天不吃水！」</p>
<p>但是那具莫明其妙的屍首太使人興奮了，酒客們還是竊竊地私議着，彷彿他們負着調查的責任似的。</p>
<p>這一天鎭上有二個人相聚的地方，沒有不是談論着這件事的。</p>
<p>直到掌燈時候，地保忽忽地跑進酒店來，拉着阿根說：</p>
<p>「那屍首調查明白了，是陳二官的老婆，派出所裏要你去問話。」</p>
<p>阿根已微微有點醉意，他把地保一持，「媽的了又不是我的老婆，問只鳥！」</p>
<p>「阿根哥，不是這個意思，」地保總是在上面碰過釘子，他哀求着阿根，一因為你是第一個發現的，要你去做見證人。這鎭上已經鬧着沒有水吃了，上面拼命追着要辦案呢！」</p>
<p>阿根笑了起來，他知道他這項生意的厲害，「不吃水，不吃水好活命嗎？」他咕嚕着跟地保上派出所去了。</p>
<p>陳二官已經逃走了，阿根睹着舌頭告訴了警官他怎樣發現那具屍首的情形，派出所貼了張緝兇的佈告後，他們袛是討論本鎭要發生恐慌的吃水問題了。</p>
<p>那是故鄕在春初發生的一件命案，陳二官至今沒有到案，鎭上的人也不復記起那件哄動一時的新聞了。每天早上，挑水阿根的山歌聲又在河灘邊唱着了</p>
<h3 id="c208">上海孤兒院印像記（上） <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— 方舟</p>
<p>（本報特寫）一個新秋的下午，我踏上了南市的公共汽車到龍華去參觀上海孤兒院。</p>
<p>車子在那條漫長寬闊的媒屑路上爬着，顚簸得非常厲害，那些小淤泥河裏的臭味是一陣一陣地從車窗裏鑽進來，常常使我用手掩鼻子。兩邊的田野房舍只像飛一般的在眼前過去，我們離開都市漸漸遠了。</p>
<p>在龍華司令部門前下了車，找到了上海孤兒院，沒有通知門房，逕自向裏面闖去。那是一個菓園，園裏全種着水蜜桃樹，由中間一條闊道中走過去，過了一頂小橋，又是一個園林，這裏也有花木亭台，草地河流。園外是一列高柳，是蔽護人行道的；這時園邊上正有幾個孤兒在刈除雜草，嘻嘻哈哈的，十分活潑。</p>
<p>由一扇木柵門裏進去，最外面的就是個接待室；室外放着兩缸荷花及許多其他盆景。我們站在室門口，想找一個人來代我們去通報這裏的院長，那時恰好有一個老媽子從裏面走出來，我便向她說明了來意，並且給了他一張名片。她接過名片，一面請我進接待室稍坐，並吩咐一個孩子獻上茶來，到隔壁去通報了。</p>
<p>接待室裏佈置得很簡潔雅微，壁上除了許多院景及孤兒生活，和工作照片外，還有幾位已過院董的遺像，本館史量才先生的遺影也有一張掛在上面，因為史先生曾有過五百元補助敎育基金撥助於該院。</p>
<p>當我正在室裏瀏覽的時候，院長張績夫先生走了進來。他是一個和藹慈祥的老人，從他那副和善的笑容裏，我們便能够看出他的為人。</p>
<p>「我們到隔壁去談談吧，那兒靜點。」他說着把身子一讓，請我們走在前面。</p>

<p>徐工頭……譚洸</p>
<p>包身工</p>
<p>因為帝國主義的壓迫和剝削，中國工農大衆的痛苦更似　了　的潮水，將工農淹得不能活命。這裏，暴露了這腐敗的舊社會中現實的一面——我們聽了每　句台詞，就似看到了他們險上凄苦的表情，和他們臨死的掙扎；以及看到漢奸們的陰刁兇惡的眼，和那根血腥的皮鞭。</p>
<p>這裏是一個泥水匠的家。泥水匠錢連生每天替那些榨壓者蓋洋樓，自己却住在一間低狹的草棚裏，過着非人的不够飽暖的苦罪。現在他工作得摔斷了一條胳膊，胸部也受了重傷，反而給榨壓者遺棄了。他睡在床上，病和失業是可以絞死他的刑具。</p>
<p>「就是好了，剩下一只胳膊，還有什麽用？不也是等着餓死嗎？」他悲憤地說。</p>
<p>他的老婆老淚縱橫地伴着他。他們就想起了女兒阿秀，等待徐工頭將阿秀的包身工的一年的價錢——八元付下來，好去買藥看病。然而，他倆害怕，抬憂着阿秀會受到監獄一樣的虐待。因為「包身工」是將女兒交給包工頭去做三年的工，價錢共三十元，但在這三年內父母就不能再見女兒的面，生死存亡，包工頭也槪不負責。所以包工頭可以無忌地虐包身工，比奴隸還要殘酷。</p>
<p>「哼！一年三百六十天辛辛苦苦的像牛馬一樣做着活，才賺十塊錢。一父親對于母親的希望和自慰，祗回答了一個令笑。</p>
<p>眞的，苦工們的一生，袛有餓塞，挨打，挨罵，直至被壓榨到死。不但做泥水匠和包身工的如此，就是縫麻袋的鄰婦李嫂子，也跑來說：</p>
<p>「自從東洋人來打過我們上海後，什麽也完了！以先我們縫麻袋，每天掙三毛多錢，有時候還可以拿到四毛多哪！現在，好，縫天累得像什麽似的，連兩毛大洋都掙不到了！」接着又吐露了對錢連生的同情。</p>
<p>可是，苦工們生在這腐敗的社會裏，有兩毛大洋一天，也够吃了半飽了；但在這兩毛裏，還要付出草棚捐及其他一切名目。於是巡捕就可以打付不出草柵捐的鄰婦女兒的嘴巴，鄰婦也就跑回家去，預備挨罵。</p>
<p>而女工阿巧姐跑來，嘴裏也滿是灰色的嘆息。她講着一個包身工吃不了苦而吊死的故事。這增加了母親的憂急。</p>
<p>這時，錢連生的女兒阿秀在工廠裏為了吃不了虐待，獨個兒偷跑回來。她害了重傷風，頭昏，身上發燒，但仍得做工；今天實在不行了，不能起床，可是包工頭仍硬迫她去上夜班，而且打她，恐嚇她如不去上夜班，就要她的命。所以她就在散工時逃回家了。</p>
<p>從此，生活使泥水匠和包身工，以及那善良的母親，都開始澈底明瞭了這社會。</p>
<p>但在被壓迫者們尚未團結成廣大的九量的時候，女兒阿秀仍給徐工頭用强硬的手段，狠狠地抓回地獄一樣的工廠去。并且揪打了她的父親！踢倒了她的母親！</p>

<h3 id="e2">The Original Letter of Loyal Advice from Lin Weicheng and Others to Li Bai <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Guangzhou) Lin Weicheng, Commander of the Guilin Air Force and Principal of the Aviation School, and others sent separate letters on the 18th to advise Li Bai and the military and civilians of Guilin. The letter to Li Bai stated: "Mr. Delin and Jiansheng, China today cannot be saved without unification, and cannot resist foreign aggression without concerted efforts. This is a clear truth that even women and children understand. Since you initiated military action, urgent messages have been exchanged rapidly, and advice has been given repeatedly. The distinction between obedience and rebellion has long been clear. The central government has been tolerant and patient, again and again, but you refuse to turn back from your misguided path, which breaks the hearts of people all over the world. You have forced all officers and soldiers of our army and air force to swear an oath of allegiance in blood, wanting to hold them hostage as your accomplices, obliterating the personality of all our comrades in the army. How can this outdated feudal evil practice deceive our modern revolutionary soldiers? We are both members of the Party and soldiers. We can only pledge allegiance to the Party and the country. Any other oath is neither from our free will nor worth a moment's consideration, and only serves to expose your ugly behavior. Recently, all comrades in arms have been able to understand the greater good deeply and are clearly and unwavering in their choice of action. This is all due to the gradual decline of the country's power, which has prompted a general awakening. If you still fail to realize this in time and still want to enslave your comrades as tools for venting your anger and satisfying your personal desires, you are truly heading for a dead end. We have long been under your command, and we cannot bear to turn our backs on you. However, observing in silence is something that our conscience does not allow. Therefore, we resolutely flew to Guangdong to submit to the central government. We hope that you will change your course and make a decisive decision to preserve your reputation and establish peace. Otherwise, the great cause of patriotism is in the hearts of all people. Those who follow in our footsteps will be numerous. If you insist on going your own way and become alienated from everyone, you will regret it too late. It will not only bring about your own demise, but future generations will not forgive you. We sincerely offer this advice, and we hope you will carefully consider it." The letter was signed by Lin Weicheng, Principal of the Guilin Aviation School and Commander of the Air Force; Ning Mingjie, Captain of the Second Squadron of the Guilin Air Force; Zheng Zixiang, Deputy Captain of the Third Squadron of the Guilin Air Force; Li Yifei, Deputy Leader of the Communications Group of the Third Squadron of the Guilin Air Force; Liang Weiru, Group Leader; and pilot Luo Rumin.

<h3 id="e3">Xu Kan Flies to Jiangxi to Meet Kong to Discuss the Plan to Reform the Guangdong Currency System <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Xu Kan, summoned by Kong Xiangxi, flew to Jiangxi on the 18th to meet with him. Kong is scheduled to fly to Guangdong with Xu on the 22nd. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The plan to reform the Guangdong currency system has been repeatedly investigated on-site by financial experts sent by the central government to Guangdong. After Xu Kan and others return from northern Guangdong this time, a concrete plan can be decided. It is reported that the authorities are being cautious about this matter for the following reasons: The total value of fractional currency issued in Guangdong in the past reached more than 250 million yuan, with a cash reserve of only 10.7 million yuan in fractional silver, accounting for 43% of the total amount issued. Although 92 million yuan in provincial treasury bonds were allocated as a guarantee reserve, these treasury bonds currently have no market value or credit, and it is difficult to consider them reliable. When reforming the Guangdong currency system, in order to stabilize Guangdong's finances and consolidate the credit of the Guangdong currency, how should the 17% cash reserve and the 40% guarantee reserve that are insufficient be compensated to make the reserve meet the predetermined amount? This requires detailed planning. This is one reason. The Guangdong fractional currency is priced in terms of silver dollars. When Chen Jitang was in Guangdong in the past, it was stipulated to be calculated by adding 44%. The remittance rate for fractional currency was also around 700 yuan. The Guangdong silver industry now suggests adding 3% for the calculation, which is a large difference. Based on the actual substance of the current reserve of fractional currency, since it only has a 43% cash reserve, each yuan is only worth 43 cents of silver. It is not only impossible to calculate by adding 3%, but even adding 44% is still far from the actual value. When reforming the Guangdong currency system, how should the exchange rate between fractional currency and legal tender be calculated so that the interests of fractional currency holders are not hindered and the finances of the entire country are not affected? This also requires careful research. This is the second reason. Guangdong has used the small silver dollar system for a considerable period of time. Unifying the national currency system is also a consistent policy of the central government in recent years. When reforming the Guangdong currency system, in order to consider both local public opinion and the central government's laws, how should the implementation plan for changing from small silver dollars to large silver dollars be decided? This also requires careful consideration. This is the third reason. In short, it is inevitable that the central government will resolutely reform the Guangdong currency system in order to unify the legal tender policy. It is also a predetermined policy to reform the Guangdong currency system within the scope of the central government's current financial capacity, adhering to the principle of taking a loss in order to protect the interests of the Guangdong people. However, the currency system is a matter of great importance to the national economy and the people's livelihood. In order to achieve satisfactory results, it is necessary to be cautious again and again. (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Kawagoe stated that the main points of his conversation with Song Zheyuan this morning were: (1) China and Japan should cooperate to prevent communism and should first ensure that the people live and work in peace and contentment, and that the lives of farmers are stable. The Communist Party will naturally be unable to operate; (2) Regarding the issue of economic development in North China, Japan's industry is making rapid progress and should cooperate with Japanese technology. If necessary, Japan can invest. Only opinions were exchanged on this issue, and there was no concrete negotiation; (3) He hopes that the authorities will use political power to stabilize the lives of farmers. Regarding the adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations, he was commissioned with a mission when he left Japan. The two countries' authorities should work together to achieve it. In addition to the three principles of Hirota, there are other approaches to the negotiation. He will visit Chiang Kai-shek early next month. After returning to Tianjin tomorrow, he will convene a meeting of consuls. After the meeting, he will visit Han Fuju in Jinan and plans to stay in Jinan for half a day before going to Qingdao, and then return to Tianjin. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese Ambassador to China Kawagoe met with reporters from various newspapers this evening, stating that he did not discuss any specific issues between China and Japan during his meeting with Song Zheyuan. However, he urged Song to pay more attention to the plight of farmers in North China. The Japanese ambassador also expressed hope that Song could improve the current situation of farmers to prevent them from falling into the Communist Party's propaganda. Regarding the issue of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, he said that Japan is very willing to provide technical and financial assistance for the development of mining and the construction of railways. When asked whether negotiations to adjust the Sino-Japanese situation would begin next month, the ambassador replied that he had not received any instructions from Tokyo regarding this matter. However, these negotiations can be held at any time as long as the time is ripe. Kawagoe also hinted that the Japanese side will not insist on the three points proposed by Hirota as the basis for these negotiations. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan, Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, along with Qin Dechun and Chen Zhongfu, paid a return visit to Ambassador Kawagoe at noon today.

The meeting ended after 20 minutes. Subsequently, Ambassador Kawagoe attended a luncheon hosted by Song and Qin at the Hebei-Chahar Political Council at 1:00 PM, which ended happily at 2:00 PM. (19th Allied News Agency Dispatch)</p>

(19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ambassador Kawagoe met with Song Zheyuan this morning and said that Japan hopes for peace in the Far East and the adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations.

<h3 id="e5">Periodic Implementation of Income Tax <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>The Implementing Regulations for the Provisional Income Tax Law were passed by the Executive Yuan the day before yesterday. The income from salaries and remuneration of public officials in Category II and the income from interest on public bonds and deposits in Category III will be taxed starting from October 1, 1936. All other items will be taxed starting from January 1, 1937. The income tax, which has not been implemented for a long time, is now being realized, which can be said to be an advance in China's tax system.</p>
<p>The reason why income tax needs to be implemented urgently is that its purpose is to increase revenue sources. It is also because direct taxation is a way to control capital, as advocated by Mr. Sun Yat-sen. However, China can still be said to have no large capitalists to date. Most of them profit from trading and are sheltered within special spheres of influence, making it very convenient to transfer and conceal their wealth. If these few so-called wealthy merchants can evade the law, then the burden of income tax will fall entirely on the working class, which would lose the original purpose of controlling capital.</p>
<p>It seems easy to levy income tax on public officials and interest on deposits. However, public officials originally contribute their income to party affairs expenses. Adding income tax leaves room for consideration regarding their ability to pay. As for interest on deposits, there are many foreign banks, and most people with wealth store their money in these banks, making taxation very difficult. On the other hand, if only Chinese bank depositors are taxed, depositors can easily become foreign merchants under assumed names. If foreign merchants are taxed together, the abuse can be prevented, but it is more difficult. Because of the unequal treaties, all reforms sometimes cannot even be discussed. In fact, it cannot be without such consideration.</p>
<p>The solution to social problems must be based on facts and cannot rely solely on theory. Recently, various undertakings have not been effective, mostly due to the abuse of relying solely on theory. The reorganization of the tax system, on the one hand, is to cultivate the people's livelihood, and on the other hand, it must consider the strength of the entire people. The people's livelihood is now extremely exhausted, and rest and recuperation are urgently needed. Although income tax is taken from people with income, people's income in recent years has also tended to decline, especially for the class with a fixed income. Their income remains the same, but their expenses have increased. Their hardships are indescribable. Therefore, at the beginning of the implementation of income tax, it is advisable to be lenient where possible, without being constrained by the amount of income.</p>
<p>The implementation of a new tax cannot be without concealment, and it cannot be without reporting. This alone has planted the seeds of disputes. There are still four months before the full implementation of income tax. It is hoped that during this period, plans will be made to be as perfect as possible. Any concerns that are considered sufficient to disturb the people should be prevented in advance. Even if the abuse cannot be avoided, organizational efforts should be made to reduce it to a minimum. It is necessary to make the people fully aware that the new tax is payable without feeling that it is burdensome and harsh. This is also the way to govern with virtue.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Li Bai's Strong Statement <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Guangzhou) Recently, Guilin's attitude has become increasingly strong. Li Bai openly stated in Nanning that he would never step down, and has gathered heavy troops in the Wuzhou area, attempting to invade Guangdong. According to reports, since Xiang Hanping and Deng Shizeng returned to Guangdong from Guilin, senior officials of the central government have made extraordinary efforts to peacefully resolve the Guilin issue in the past week. Chiang Kai-shek has promised to advocate leniency. Reporters have inquired from various sources and learned that the main points of the resolution plan brought by Liu Weizhang are: (1) Bai will take a new position or go abroad for inspection in the name of Chairman of Zhejiang; (2) Li Zongren can temporarily stay in Guilin; (3) The Guilin Provincial Government will still be led by Huang Xuchu; (4) The troops in Guilin will be re-designated and reorganized into six divisions by the central government, and Bai is invited to Hong Kong to meet with a senior official first. When Liu was about to leave, he told people that Li Bai would definitely accept this plan. However, after Liu returned to Yongzhou, a telegram was not received until the 17th, creating new complications and raising new demands. It can be seen that Liu's visit to Guangdong was entirely to temporarily alleviate the situation. (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e8">Ministry of Finance Prepares to Levy Income Tax <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Preparatory Office for Central Direct Taxes of the Ministry of Finance has stated that the Provisional Income Tax Law and its Implementing Regulations will both take effect on October 1, and it is stipulated that the income from salaries and remuneration of public officials in Category II and the income from interest on public bonds and deposits in Category III will be levied starting from October 1. It is currently preparing for the levy. Regarding the income from salaries and remuneration of public officials, the tax amount shall be calculated according to the tax rates stipulated in the Regulations for the Income Contribution Collection Plan for Central Government, and each agency shall be notified to collect the tax. The income contribution will end at the end of September to avoid double taxation. Regarding the income from interest on public bonds and deposits, the office is currently investigating the total amount of public bonds issued in China and the total amount of deposits in various banks and firms. In the future, the office will notify the banks and firms that pay interest annually to calculate and collect taxes at a rate of 50 per thousand. The procedures for collecting the above income are easier, and the calculation method is simple. Preparations will be completed before the end of September. The procedures for collecting the remaining income from profit-making enterprises in Category I, the income from salaries and remuneration of freelancers and others engaged in various industries in Category II, and the income from interest on corporate bonds and stocks in Category III are more complicated, and the calculation is also more cumbersome. It will take more time to prepare for the levy, which will begin on January 1 of next year. (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The government's implementation of income tax, as decided by the Executive Yuan, will be implemented for the income of public officials' salaries and income from public bonds and deposits starting from October 1. The rest will be implemented starting from New Year's Day next year. After review by the Executive Yuan, the Implementing Regulations for Income Tax have several revisions to the collection procedures. The Preparatory Office for Central Direct Taxes is currently making textual revisions and will announce them soon. As for the collection of income tax from foreigners residing in China, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Finance are preparing to notify the procedures. Mr. Massey, President of the British General Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, has clearly stated that British merchants will strongly support the Chinese government's legal and reasonable taxes. According to those familiar with the financial situation, foreigners residing in China who have already paid income tax when residing in other countries will not pay income tax in their home country again according to the laws of various countries. It is expected that the implementation will proceed smoothly. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The implementation of the Civil Servant Screening and Review Regulations and the Civil Servant Registration Regulations has concluded. However, civil servants from the Northeast provinces, due to the incident [Mukden Incident], fled into the interior, and most of their supporting documents were lost, resulting in them not being able to obtain qualifications. The central government believes that among them are many individuals with superior learning, broad knowledge, and extensive experience, and it would be a pity if they were unable to advance. It is imperative to find ways to provide relief. The competent authorities have been instructed to formulate remedial measures for the civil service status of displaced Northeast civil servants, as well as a brief outline of the Northeast Displaced Civil Servants' Qualifications Review Committee. The remedial measures are roughly divided into three items: (1) The Examination Yuan will organize a Northeast Displaced Civil Servants' Qualifications Review Committee to thoroughly review the origin, experience, education, and usual thoughts and behaviors of Northeast civil servants. Those deemed appropriate will be certified and forwarded to the Ministry of Personnel; (2) Northeast displaced civil servants are specially permitted to submit applications for review in accordance with the Civil Servant Registration Regulations promulgated by the National Government on April 23rd, 1934, and its implementing rules. This review period is limited to six months, but the Ministry of Personnel will not review applications that are not forwarded by the Qualifications Review Committee. Furthermore, the individuals applying for registration are limited to those who served in the Northeast before the "September 18th" incident and left their posts and entered the interior due to the incident. Those originally serving in the interior who are of Northeast origin may not invoke this precedent; (3) Those whose qualifications in the Plan for the Settlement of Displaced Personnel from the Four Northeastern Provinces have been reviewed and found to meet the qualifications in the Screening Regulations are specially permitted to be issued a certificate by the Ministry of Personnel. In the Wood Management Plan, those whose qualifications have been reviewed in accordance with the Civil Servant Appointment Act and possess higher qualifications in the Screening Regulations are also permitted to submit documents within the six-month registration period to request a review. Those who pass the review will also be issued a certificate. As for the members of the Qualifications Review Committee, the Examination Yuan has appointed Wang Shuchang, Jin Zhaohua, Huang Henghao, Wang Xianzhang, Zhou Tianfang, Qi Shiying, Gao Xibing, Xu Zhen, and Dong Zhengqi. Gao Xibing, Xu Zhen, and Dong Zhengqi will serve as standing committee members. The committee will be located in the Hualin Hall of the Examination Yuan and will be formally established and begin operations soon. (19th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

<p>Hendaye, Southern France - A special dispatch from our correspondent reports that rebel forces in the northern province of Guipúzcoa took flanking actions last night, advancing along the ridge near the village of Oronoz, and this morning launched another fierce attack on the city of Irún. Government troops inside the city are digging trenches and fortifying their positions, determined to resist with all their might, and have laid landmines everywhere to hinder the rebel advance. All women and children in the area have gathered at the border between France and Spain so that if the situation worsens, they can flee into France at any time. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>Hendaye - Currently, no fewer than 9,000 people are participating in the fierce battle for Irún. The location is fifteen miles east of San Sebastián, bordering France, and is currently under attack by rebel forces. It is reported that the rebels advanced to the hill where the Fort San Marcial is located at night and captured it. Despite the government torpedo boat anchored in the Bidassoa River opening fire, they ignored it. In addition to capturing the fort six hundred yards from Irún, the rebels also occupied the entire artillery battery position and immediately turned it against the defending troops in the city. Today, hundreds of refugees fled across the border from Irún into France. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Madrid - At present, the south of Spain is temporarily calm, and the focus of attention in the civil war has shifted to the north, where government troops are doing everything possible to protect their positions. Government troops, aided by armored vehicles, repelled advancing rebel forces near Hendaye, on the south bank of the Bidassoa River, near the French border city of Behobia. However, the situation of the government troops in San Sebastián is reportedly dire. The government troops there have issued an ultimatum to the rebel warships anchored in the harbor, stating that if they continue to bombard San Sebastián and Fort Guadalupe, all captured rebels will be executed. Last night, a large number of suspects were rounded up in San Sebastián and imprisoned in the fort, which already held more than 1,200 prisoners, many of whom were wealthy aristocrats. It is said that the accuracy of the rebel warship "España" in yesterday's shelling has improved, with most of the shells landing near the fort. According to a French eyewitness, the shelling resulted in significant loss of life and property, with as many as fifty deaths and about a hundred injuries, causing great panic among the city's residents. The residents' opposition to the rebels has intensified due to the relentless shelling. The city's civil governor, fearing that the 1,500 rebel prisoners in the city's prison might be lynched, dispatched troops to protect them. Several shells landed at the central station, only a stone's throw from the French consulate, and the nearby maternity hospital was also hit, tragically killing a newborn infant. The rebel shelling lasted for four hours before temporarily stopping, but it resumed in the evening. According to reliable sources, the rebel cruiser "Cervantes" was holed by the fort and has sailed to Ferrol for repairs. (Reuters, 19th)</p>

<p>Gibraltar - It was learned here today that the Arab soldiers in the rebel forces in La Línea mutinied because they only received half of their pay. They have been disarmed and imprisoned in the camp. In order to stabilize the army, the rebel leader promised the Arab soldiers that they could loot freely when La Línea was cleared. A telegram from Tangier stated that the Rif tribesmen in North Africa are deeply afraid that there will be no food to supply the rebel forces, or are unwilling to join the rebel forces in battle, fearing being massacred by General Franco's troops, so there is talk of instability. According to unconfirmed reports, several units of the Western Moroccan garrison have also rebelled, opposing General Franco. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>

The rebel radio station in Seville admitted that the anti-government forces have encountered strong resistance east of Mérida, while the government forces also declared that they have defeated a column of rebel forces there. The rebel radio station also claimed that a revolution has broken out at the important naval base of Cartagena. At the same time, according to news from Lisbon, Portugal, Navalvillar de Pela, forty miles west of Madrid, is likely to face a fierce attack from rebel forces, as General Franco's troops have been sent from the south to reinforce General Mola's forces. Hundreds of Spanish leftists have fled from La Línea to Gibraltar for three weeks and have now boarded ships to Málaga to assist the government forces in battle. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Madrid - The government recently announced that government troops have won victories in many places, such as in the Guadarrama Mountains north of the capital, where government troops have made progress. The rebel cruiser "Admiral Cervera" has been shelling San Sebastián, Irún, Pasajes, and other places on the northern front for days, but after being returned fire by government artillery, it has been damaged. Yesterday, it stayed in the port of Santoña all day, unable to do anything, and then sailed to Ferrol for repairs, but it is feared that it may not be able to reach its destination. In addition, government troops have also won victories on the island of Majorca in the Mediterranean. The rebel leader on the island of Ibiza in the west has been executed. In short, the government currently controls the following important cities: the capital Madrid; Barcelona, Valencia, Alicante, Tarragona, Albacete, Almería along the Mediterranean coast; the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean; San Sebastián, Bilbao, Gijón, Santoña along the Bay of Biscay; and Cáceres in the west. As for the city of Granada in the south, it is under siege. The rebel bases in Ceuta and Melilla in Morocco, Oviedo in the northwest, and the Andalusia region in the south are being bombed by government aircraft, with great success. The capital has also begun recruiting new soldiers for training, who will be incorporated into the regular army in six months. (Havas, 19th)</p>

Representatives of the revolutionary government have been ordered to find ways to overthrow the Madrid government. Observers familiar with the situation believe that this move indicates that the rebel side hopes that the People's Front government will collapse due to riots and chaos, so that the rebel forces can enter the capital under the guise of suppressing the rebellion and saving the nation, while also avoiding bombing by the air force, which would anger the public.

The "Political News" here reported the details of the battle, stating that government troops had long ago discovered that a column of rebel forces was heading north from the city of Badajoz, intending to cross the province of Extremadura and join the rebel forces on the northern front. Yesterday morning, they dispatched two bombers, each carrying a hundred bombs, to the location of the rebel column, where they saw a large group of rebel forces and more than 300 trucks advancing. They immediately began dropping bombs on them. Many trucks were hit by the bombs and shattered into pieces. The rebel forces were panicked and at a loss. When the bombs carried by the two planes were exhausted, two more planes came to assist in the battle, while the first two planes flew back to base to reload bombs and returned to bomb. As a result, the rebel column was almost completely wiped out. Since the beginning of the war, this battle can be said to be the most important. (Havas, 18th)</p>

<p>(Paris) - Secretary-General of the United General Confederation of Labor, Jouhaux, returned from Madrid yesterday and gave an interview to our correspondent, detailing his impressions of the trip, saying, "Spanish labor organizations are now abandoning their personal opinions and doing everything in their power to defend the republican system. In their eyes, the problem today is only one thing: the republican system should immediately defeat the traitors who are fighting separately. My impressions of this trip are very good. The Spanish people are now determined to defend the republican system and are determined to achieve their goals. The people's power is in the initial stage of organization, and there may be shortcomings, but given time, it can be adjusted, trained, unified, and used. Today, the world regards the Spanish people who are protecting their freedom and rights as the same as the rebels, without any distinction. What is the reason for this? The people are very puzzled by this. For example, the rebels' military supplies are provided by Germany and Italy, so there is no need to worry about shortages. These people are resisting the legitimate government, and the place where they launched their rebellion is not unique to Spain, but is under the joint jurisdiction of the signatory countries of the 1906 Algeciras Treaty, so they cannot enjoy the right to receive supplies. From an international standpoint, the Spanish government has the right to request assistance from various countries, but other countries are hesitating and being overly cautious in providing assistance, which is more generous to the rebels and thin to the people. The facts are there, and there is nothing to hide. How can the Spanish people not feel deep pain and inexplicable surprise when they think of this?" (Havas, 18th)</p>

<p>(London) - According to responsible sources today, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has assured Britain that Italy hopes that the Spanish civil war will not develop into a European war and shares the same feeling with Britain. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano has also expressed to Britain Italy's willingness to maintain neutrality in Spain, and declared that Italy has not had any contact with the rebel forces regarding Morocco and the Balearic Islands, in the hope of changing the status quo if the Spanish rebel forces were to be victorious.

It must be known that what Italy is seeking is to establish an absolute neutrality system, and to do everything possible to promote its success."

Although negotiations on this matter have not yet yielded any definite results, fourteen countries have expressed their intention to participate to the French government. Among them, Czechoslovakia, Belgium, and Austria are participating unconditionally.

Germany has just accepted the draft agreement in writing the day before yesterday, and has proposed three reservations. Only the Italian government, in addition to expressing support in principle orally to the French ambassador Chambrun by the Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano on the 14th of this month, and proposing several reservations, has not yet made any statement. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) - Foreign Secretary Eden has returned to work today after his vacation, and met with Acting Foreign Secretary, Lord Privy Seal Halifax, for several hours. According to reliable sources, Eden will continue to adopt a non-intervention policy on the issue of the Spanish civil war, which is no different from the policy pursued by Lord Halifax during his acting period. He will work hard to carry out the following two approaches internally and externally: (1) prohibit the export of domestic military supplies to Spain; (2) support the French proposal to the governments of various countries, especially Germany and Italy. Germany has submitted a reply to the French proposal, but still has three conditions attached. Italy has not yet replied. The latest trends of the two countries are described below: (1) The Italian government still insists that no money should be supplied to the two warring factions in Spain. Regarding this, the British Chargé d'Affaires in Italy, Ingram, visited the Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano yesterday afternoon and told him that it was practically difficult to implement this measure. Ciano replied that when the Italian-Abyssinian War was fought, the British government had rigorously implemented financial and economic sanctions against Italy without any difficulty. Why is it difficult only for Spain now? In addition, the Italian requirements include (A) banning newspaper propaganda, and (B) not allowing people from various countries to volunteer to join the warring factions in Spain. These two may be easier to satisfy, such as France has agreed to ban people from going to Spain to help in the war, which is one example. However, according to political figures, the Italian government still intends to delay the negotiations on the non-intervention agreement. Although the negotiations are full of twists and turns, it is better than failure. (2) As for Germany's attitude, it can be called satisfactory, because the German government has already agreed to participate in the draft agreement proposed by France, but has attached three reservations, namely (A) the German aircraft detained by the Spanish authorities should be returned immediately; (B) all countries that manufacture and sell military supplies should participate in the non-intervention agreement; (C) people from various countries should be prohibited from volunteering to join the warring factions in Spain. Regarding the first item, it is heard that the British Foreign Office has advised the Spanish ambassador Oliven to ask the Spanish government to allow the previously detained aircraft to be returned to Germany (a total of six aircraft, only one of which has not yet been released). Regarding the second item, most of the countries that manufacture military supplies have agreed to participate in the French proposal, and it will not be difficult for Germany to lose its excuse. Regarding the third item, France has also agreed to do so. Furthermore, according to responsible sources, the Spanish government's proposed appeal to the League of Nations must be avoided and must not be realized. Otherwise, after receiving the application, the League of Nations will inevitably send personnel to investigate the causes of the rebellion, which will inevitably involve Germany and Italy. As a result, the tension between the fascist countries and the democratic countries will only worsen. (Havas, 18th)</p>

<p>Seville: General Del Llano, commander of the revolutionary forces in Andalusia, recently gave a radio broadcast stating that when government aircraft recently bombed revolutionary positions in various locations, particularly in the city of Ronda in the province of Malaga, many of the bombs used were British-made. It is said that the government forces purchased as many as 4,000 bombs from British munitions factories through Ambassador Oliven, which is intolerable. Furthermore, our army now has the support of nine-tenths of the people of the country, but many countries call us rebels, which is deeply regrettable. Also, the British United Telegraph Company has cut the submarine cable between that country and the Spanish Canary Islands, which is also unpleasant. Regarding war news, the revolutionary forces in the province of Cordoba have defeated a column of government troops and occupied the town of Alora. A civil affairs officer in the northern port of Bilbao, a member of the People's Front party, is preparing to flee, while the governor of the southern province of Malaga has already escaped. General Del Llano then warned the Madrid government that if the government dares to harm a single hair on the heads of arrested revolutionary comrades, the revolutionary forces will execute all members of the People's Front held as hostages, including the miners of the Rio Tinto mining area.

<p>(Washington) Japanese Navy Lieutenant General Yoshida, leading a training squadron to visit the United States, declared today that if the US and Japan can maintain a policy of non-threat and non-aggression, the Pacific Ocean is large enough to prevent the two navies from coming into contact. American people have warmly welcomed our visit, which has greatly moved me. As for the talk of the Soviet Union building a Far Eastern fleet, it is probably just talk on paper, and Japan is not concerned. There is also nothing about Pacific aviation that worries Japan, because navies can always evolve with the times, and Japan is not afraid. Battleships and aircraft are indeed mutually supportive, but it is undeniable that the power of aircraft has increasingly increased in naval strategy. (18th National Telegram)</p>

<p>Yosemite, California, USA: The Pacific Society continued its meeting today. Former British Naval Minister Alexander asked the Japanese representative to explain which industries Japan intends to support with its aggressive expansion of foreign trade, or whether it intends to cover up its imperialism. Regarding the relationship between Britain and Japan, Alexander denied that the two countries had engaged in negotiations to discuss Britain's recognition of "Manchukuo," and said that he specifically warned Japan that if it wants to follow in Italy's footsteps and not stand among the nations of the world, then its position is very dangerous. After Alexander finished speaking, American representative Steinhardt rose to read an article titled "The Economic Failure of the Japanese Occupation of Manchuria," stating that this action by Japan cannot solve Japan's economic difficulties, nor can it make Japan economically self-sufficient. The representatives also believed that the issue of Japan buying 60 million yuan of American cotton annually was overemphasized. Experts from the Pacific Society also said that the greatest danger of Japan's cotton policy is whether Japan can develop China's cotton production. If successful, it will withdraw from the American market. The conference then discussed other ways to ensure the neutrality of the Philippines in addition to international conventions. The representatives believed that the first way should be protection by the United States, and the second way should be joint protection by the three major powers, but the Philippine representative insisted that the Philippines has no fear of being invaded.

Upon learning of this incident, the factory immediately sent staff to investigate the truth. According to the Nanjing Tap Water Factory authorities, the burst pipe was not supplied by the manufacturer represented by our factory. Although most of the tap water pipes in Nanjing were supplied by our factory, a portion was still produced by Chinese factories. Therefore, this incident has nothing to do with the products and contracts of the manufacturer represented by our factory.

<h3 id="e65">Oath-Taking Ceremony for Various Guangdong Officials: Original Text of Chairman Chiang's Address (Continued) <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Regarding Guangdong's politics and society, we must first address the most urgent reforms and ensure the following three matters are handled first. First, eradicate corruption. Second, eliminate opium and gambling. Third, cease competing with the people for profit.</p>
<p>Regarding the first point, the corruption of Guangdong's past politics is something everyone has been deeply pained by. Heavy and overlapping taxes and levies provided limited gains for the government, while the people suffered endlessly. Going forward, we must encourage integrity in character, reduce burdens in politics, and use strict laws to punish corruption. We must ensure that all malpractices are eradicated, bribery disappears, and we move into a bright and progressive political system.</p>
<p>This point is closely related to personnel management. The reason corruption cannot be eradicated is mostly due to a lack of freedom in personnel appointments within various agencies. In revolutionary politics, there are so-called 'lucrative' and 'lean' positions, which is inherently a shameful thing. However, these lucrative positions are often filled by individuals recommended by powerful figures in the Party and military. This not only prevents the heads of departments and agencies from carrying out rectification but also gives rise to corrupt politics.</p>
<p>Going forward, no military officer at any level should casually recommend individuals to Party and government agencies. Furthermore, Party and government officials in charge must strictly adhere to their authority and not casually recommend individuals to agencies at the same level or subordinate agencies. The person in charge must be able to take full responsibility, after which the superiors can effectively supervise, ensuring that politics is on the right track.</p>
<p>For example, now that I, Chiang Kai-shek, am serving as the President of the Executive Yuan, apart from the appointments I regularly make within my jurisdiction, I have not recommended a single person to any department. I fully trust the heads of each ministry and commission to appoint personnel responsibly, following the selection regulations. However, I will supervise and penalize those who fail in their duties, ensuring that the heads of all subordinate agencies can take full responsibility without being constrained or interfered with. This is a principle that superiors must adhere to, and it is also the key to political success.</p>
<p>In short, we must each recognize our own authority and responsibilities and never infringe upon the authority of superiors, peers, or subordinates. Only then can we ensure that politics is clean and transparent. Know that if relatives and friends truly have the knowledge, experience, and qualifications, they will naturally have opportunities to serve even without recommendations. This is the foundation for creating a clean government, and the key is to enforce the law impartially. When encountering corruption or bribery, we must punish them to the fullest extent.</p>
<p>This time, the military, financial, and Party officials sent by the Central Government should especially serve as role models. If they engage in personal gain or corruption, Chiang Kai-shek will definitely take strict action and punish them according to military law. Right now, the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters will set up a tip box. If any Central Government personnel engage in personal gain or corruption, the people can submit reports. However, the informant must provide their real name and address, as well as accurate information and evidence.</p>
<p>In short, we must make Guangdong's military, financial, and Party affairs a model for the whole country, and we must not allow the slightest bit of favoritism.</p>
<p>Secondly, we must exert all our strength to eliminate opium and gambling. Opium and gambling are a stain on revolutionary politics that must be removed. The fact that opium dens and gambling houses still exist in Guangdong today is truly a disgrace to our Party. The Central Government has made a firm decision that no matter how difficult the financial situation, we will not seek a single cent of tax revenue from these harmful and destructive vices. We must strictly eliminate them. Because if opium and gambling are not eliminated, not only will society be harmed, leading to lethargy, dissipation, moral decay, and ruin, but also military discipline will be impossible to rectify. Therefore, in the future, whether it is the evaluation of political officials or military officers, we must use the thorough elimination of opium and gambling as the standard for rewards and punishments. Society should also regard it as a major enemy and strive to eradicate it. The entire Party, government, and military should treat this as a major matter. We must know that even if we cannot bring benefits to the people today, we must passively eliminate harm for the people.</p>
<p>Third, we must strongly avoid competing with the people for profit. In the past, Guangdong used "control" as a pretext to put many industries under the name of government operation, seeking personal gain for a few. This is absolutely unacceptable. Our revolutionary politics is about creating wealth for the people, not seizing wealth from the people, and even less about using the power of government offices to compete for profit with the people. The so-called "control" should only be limited to the necessities of national defense and economic self-defense, as well as the development of basic industries. It should not be a predatory approach like in the past that can be called "control."</p>
<p>Therefore, going forward, we must thoroughly review all industries to ensure that the people's interests are not infringed upon. We must ensure that the country, society, and the people all benefit and absolutely cannot deprive the people of their interests for self-enrichment. All undertakings that violate this principle should be cancelled.</p>
<p>Related to this is that we must pay attention to the governance of officials, carefully select officials who love the people, and evaluate them. We must ensure that commissioners and county magistrates can truly take responsibility for relieving the people's suffering.</p>
<p>The above three points are the most urgent matters that must be addressed first. Other matters that should be promoted or reformed in politics, Chairman Huang, being virtuous and just, will surely lead all our comrades to respond together in the Party, government, and military to carry them out earnestly, so as not to fail the expectations of the people of Guangdong.</p>
<p>The above explains the three important matters we must strive to do in a passive way. In addition to this, we must pay attention to the fact that revolution is about implementing the Three Principles of the People, and the spirit of the principles lies in what the Premier had repeatedly warned us, that we must restore the inherent spirit and morality of the nation in order to restore the inherent position of the nation. Therefore, we must abide by the Premier's teachings of the Eight Virtues: loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, harmony, and peace. In terms of implementation, whether in the Party, government, or military, we must start with the spirit of "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame." The ancients said, "Propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame are the four pillars of a nation; if the four pillars are not upheld, the nation will perish." Although this is an old saying, it is truly the supreme principle for governing the country in a revolutionary way.</p>
<p>The so-called "propriety" is actually about procedures and discipline. "Propriety" is not only about form but also about discipline in practice. The reason China has become so disorganized, poor, weak, and vulnerable to foreign bullying and aggression is because it did not know the importance of discipline and lacked the spirit of observing the law and abiding by the rules. Therefore, the country and the nation have become disorganized. If we want to strive to be modern citizens, we must strictly abide by the discipline of the Party and the country, be able to obey on the one hand, and be responsible on the other, supporting and encouraging each other, not infringing upon or betraying each other. This is the ultimate meaning of propriety.</p>
<p>The so-called "righteousness" is to be selfless and impartial. Where righteousness lies, one should be willing to die for it. We have principles in the Party and justice in society. We should not shirk responsibility or be perfunctory, but only follow righteousness, not fear the strong, and not seek personal gain. Like this time, Commander Yu and the air force officers and soldiers pledged allegiance to the Central Government, which is an expression of the spirit of righteousness.</p>
<p>As for the so-called "integrity," it must be done thoroughly, but one must recognize one's own position and not infringe upon the authority of others. The ancients said, "Honing integrity and uprightness" means firmly adhering to strict boundaries.</p>
<p>The so-called "shame" is a very profound realization. Taking Guangdong as an example, opium, corruption, and prostitution are tangible shames. The ancients said, "There is no greater shame than not knowing shame." Because one does not know shame, one becomes negligent and indifferent, ultimately bringing about great shame. Extending this further, why has our revolution not succeeded to this day, and why has the country been brought to such a humiliating and painful state? All of this is the indelible shame of our Party members, officials, and military personnel. Knowing shame is the ability to act, and knowing shame is the commitment to not shirking responsibility. Therefore, our Party, government, and military comrades must wash away the stains of the past and promote future undertakings. We must lead by example and encourage ourselves with the four pillars of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame. Anything that is in accordance with propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame should be done without regard to interests, and anything that violates propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame must be avoided at all costs, even if there are swords and axes in front or benefits behind.</p>
<p>This time, the revolutionary soldiers of Guangdong have revived the revolutionary spirit. The question now is how to seize this promising opportunity, promote the existing glory, and complete the revolutionary cause. To achieve this goal, we must first establish Party, government, and military agencies with principles, responsibility, and discipline. First and foremost, our Party, government, and military comrades must eliminate the decadent habits of arrogance, extravagance, indulgence, romance, and corruption, and promote the upright spirit of hard work, endurance, simplicity, and perseverance. In short, we must establish an independent, unwavering, and flawless personality, lead by example, and transform the atmosphere, inspiring people's hearts. Not only must we thoroughly reform our past bad habits, thoughts, and actions, but we must also make our revolutionary army a model for the people, make our Party headquarters a center of revolution, and make our government a clean and capable government. All personnel in upper and lower agencies should develop a strict and upright style, not only treating subordinates with strictness, but also treating themselves with greater strictness, not only disciplining others with righteousness, but especially disciplining themselves with righteousness. Only in this way can we shoulder the important responsibilities of the revolution and accomplish our common mission.</p>
<p>I hope everyone will encourage each other and supervise each other. If the central authorities have actions that are unjust or not strict, any comrade should first punish them according to Party discipline and national law. If Chiang Kai-shek violates revolutionary principles, any compatriot and subordinate can treat me as a rebel.</p>
<p>Why do we emphasize the words "discipline" and "uprightness" again to encourage our comrades? Know that our country is in the midst of an unprecedented national crisis, and our revolution is at a critical juncture of success or failure. Everyone must not be careless or slack in the slightest, otherwise the nation will never recover and the country will not be able to exist.</p>
<p>Coming to today's grand meeting, we cannot help but think of the past. The various changes in Guangdong in the past were not actually due to the inherent nature of the troublemakers. As I said above, I personally cannot but take the blame. The biggest reason is that I did not tell them about the great righteousness and the right path of the revolution in a very strict manner, nor could I supervise them with a strict attitude. Therefore, some people say that Guangdong has been chaotic for years because of the Central Government's excessive indulgence. Because of being accustomed to indulgence, over time, bad habits gradually developed, and in the end, they became almost incurable, not only harming the local area and the country, but also harming the subordinates in practice. I thought that those who were responsible for Guangdong in the past, such as Li Renzhao, Chen Zhenru, and even Chen Bonan, if they had adhered to Party and national discipline and followed the right path in everything, how could they not have made great contributions to the country and the revolution? It was only because Chiang Kai-shek's sincerity was not trusted and the Central Government was too indulgent that they misled the country and themselves. It is really painful. This is not only their fault, but also Chiang Kai-shek's fault. Today, returning to Guangzhou, reflecting on the present and thinking about the past, I am really ashamed and guilty. Therefore, today I petition the Central Government to pardon Li, Chen, and their affiliated subordinates, and I want to request punishment myself.</p>
<p>In the future, if we want our comrades to succeed in their careers, we must love people with virtue and expect them to be strict and upright. Know that there is a difference between strictness and harshness, and there is also a difference between interfering with actions and restricting actions, and there is even more of a difference between restricting freedom and depriving freedom. If our comrades have improper places, interfering with him and correcting him is precisely to perfect him. Regarding the highest interests of the Party and the country, and what is not allowed in the rules and regulations, our restrictions on him are actually protecting him. A soldier, official, and Party member has no freedom, only the country has freedom. The Premier's precious teachings are indeed an unchanging rule for all ages. If there is no restriction for one day, there will be indulgence every day, and in the end, they will go on a dangerous path and lose their protection. If one place is not interfered with, then every place will be out of bounds, and it will inevitably fail to complete its beginning and end. Going out of bounds and indulging for a long time can create a step towards doing evil. Therefore, our Party, government, and military comrades, in order to maintain a consistent history and cause from top to bottom, must strictly abide by discipline and be wary at all times, and at the same time must do their best to fulfill their duties, and must not fail to advise when there is wrongdoing, and must not fail to encourage when there is goodness. Especially those responsible comrades who are in the position of supporting the career of superiors, and have the responsibility of the success or failure of the career, should thoroughly understand this meaning. A gentleman loves people with virtue, so he should take principles and morality as the standard for both superiors and subordinates, and should not be eager for immediate success and petty gains, so as to confuse the upper and lower levels and lose the revolutionary stance. Since we are a common body of life and death, we should regard honor and disgrace and praise and slander as one. At this time of re-establishing the foundation, in order to expect the revolution and everyone's success in their careers, I have specially put it forward and earnestly told you, I believe that our comrades in the field, both civil and military, will definitely accept this heartfelt advice, especially be careful to the end. There is still one very important meaning to say, that is, the relationship between Guangdong and the Central Government, whether in the East or in China, will rise from Guangdong, and in the future, it must also rely on the strength of Guangdong to achieve the final success. This is Guangdong's unique responsibility, and it is also Guangdong's unique honor. The contribution of the people of Guangdong to the country and the revolution is shining for all ages. Also because of this, Guangdong and the Central Government must not have any separation. Know that without Guangdong, there would be no Central Government today, and without the Central Government, there would be no Guangdong today. Therefore, if the Central Government is strong and stable, it is Guangdong's welfare. Conversely, if the Central Government fails, it is Guangdong's failure, and it is the failure of the entire revolution. Guangdong and the Central Government share the same honor and disgrace, interests and losses, and are completely one. Although today's Central Government is in Nanjing, its spirit is completely in Guangdong. In terms of Party affairs, the number of Party members in Guangdong exceeds that of any province, so the task of Guangdong comrades is particularly important, and they must especially cherish and love themselves, continue the spirit left by the Premier, and complete the final task of the revolution. The Central Government cannot do without Guangdong, and if Guangdong leaves the Central Government, it will inevitably fall into failure and pain. If the Central Government succeeds, Guangdong will also succeed. In the past, the Guangdong authorities did not know this meaning. People like Li Renzhao, Chen Zhenru, and Chen Bonan thought that without the Central Government, Guangdong could also exist, and without the Central Government leading the Guangdong army, it could also exist independently. This is a big mistake. Know that the whole revolution lies in the consolidation of the foundation, and the Central Government is the foundation for consolidating the revolution. If there are only limbs and no head, then its spirit will have nowhere to be entrusted, and how can it exist? Therefore, the Central Government and Guangdong cannot be separated, and Chiang Kai-shek, Director Yu, Chairman Huang, and the comrades of the land, sea, and air forces in Guangdong are also the same, and cannot be separated. In the future, there must not be any distinction between each other. The general compatriots and comrades in Guangdong, as well as the military, must know this meaning. If Guangdong is unified, of course the strength of the Central Government will increase, but it must be known that this is the basic stability of the revolution, and it is actually the increase in Guangdong's welfare. Whether it is to people, to things, or to economic relations, in the future, there must be no distinction between the Central Government and the local government. In other provinces, it may be regarded that there is a distinction between the Central Government and the local government, but in Guangdong, the Central Government and the local government are completely one. If everyone thoroughly recognizes this point, the glory of Guangdong's future will be limitless, and the future of the Chinese revolution will also be limitless. In short, this time it can be said that not only has the revolutionary base been restored, but also the revolutionary spirit of our Party has been restored. From this, I am reminded of the past, in the painful environment of the past, many revolutionary comrades have suffered oppression and tasted sacrifices, and it is even more worthy of our remembrance that they have maintained a line of righteousness. Since there is such a glorious and great achievement this time, everyone must know that such an achievement is very difficult to obtain and easy to lose, and they must be cautious and fearful and do their best to maintain it, reversing their previous actions, thoughts, and habits, and thoroughly understanding what Guangdong's position is and what its responsibilities are. Especially the Guangdong soldiers must recognize their own responsibilities and position, and know the difficulty of creating a new situation, and jointly maintain the existing cause, and strive to promote it, so that Guangdong can fulfill its greatest responsibility in the future revolutionary history. I hope that our Party, government, and military officials in charge, from today onwards, will especially unite sincerely, work together harmoniously, endure hardship and hard work, and work together to cultivate the great personality of revolutionaries for themselves, and build Guangdong into a model province and region, create a healthy Party headquarters, establish a clean government, in order to consolidate our revolutionary base and restore the glory of our Party's revolutionary history. Only in this way can we be worthy of the compatriots of the whole province of Guangdong, not fail the expectations of the people of the whole country, and also comfort the spirit of our Premier in heaven.

<h3 id="e66">Anhui Province: High-Profile Adjustment of Mobile Finance; Issuance of Subsidiary Coin Notes Worth 2.5 Million Yuan; Clearing of Private Notes with Denominations of One, Two, and Five Jiao <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Although Anhui Province is adjacent to the Yangtze River, its customs are closed and conservative. In terms of finance, what the people trust the most are only hard coins, namely "Large Dragon Dollars" and "Small Copper Coins." Paper money only circulates among large shops and intellectuals. This is because Anhui Province is essentially an agricultural area. Wuhu is the only port for foreign trade, and there is virtually no industry. Rural farmers have simple minds and are easily prejudiced. Regarding the use of paper money, they are often suspicious and worried, which causes frequent obstacles to financial adjustment. In particular, the leakage and loss of copper coins make them increasingly scarce and difficult to circulate. Local public organizations or shops in various counties of northern Anhui take the opportunity to issue jiao notes and cash notes without authorization. The reserve funds are unverifiable, and the exchange rate is without any standard, leading to numerous malpractices. Although the people suffer from it, there is nothing they can do. In recent years, although the subsidiary coin notes of the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Central Bank, and the Farmers Bank can be widely used throughout the province, the amount is still insufficient to meet the demand. Profiteers often require premiums for exchange. The various hard subsidiary coins newly issued by the Central Government are extremely limited in their inflow into Anhui Province, serving only for people to collect and admire. The scarcity of copper coins and the shortage of subsidiary coins have invisibly raised the prices of daily necessities, which has a significant impact on people's livelihoods. The Anhui Provincial Government, after much assessment, believes that there is an urgent need to seek relief. Therefore, it intends to comply with Article 10 of the "Provisional Measures for Provincial Banks or Local Banks to Obtain or Issue Convertible Notes" approved by the Central Political Conference, and Anhui has a local bank to issue subsidiary coin notes worth 5 million yuan, so that finance in various places can be unblocked, and the illegal issuance of notes can also be rectified and cleared. After consulting the Ministry of Finance, it was approved to issue 2.5 million yuan because the amount was too large, and ordered to properly allocate the types and amounts of the subsidiary coin notes to be ordered and printed, and report to the ministry for approval. At the same time, it still follows the regulations to deposit cash and guarantee reserves with the local Central Bank for safekeeping. When the amount of new subsidiary coins issued by the Central Government is sufficient to meet the needs, the subsidiary coin notes of the Anhui Bank may be ordered to be withdrawn at any time to unify the monetary policy. After receiving this reply from the Ministry of Finance, the provincial government immediately ordered the local bank to actively prepare. It has now been determined that the subsidiary coin notes will be divided into three types: one jiao, two jiao, and five jiao. The design has already been drawn, and it has been decided to use the Zhenfeng Pagoda of Yingjiang Temple in Anqing as the symbol. It is estimated that within two months, these subsidiary coin notes will be circulating in various places in Anhui Province. (18th)</p>

<p>Hankou Correspondence: The Hubei Provincial Rural Cooperation Committee has been established for more than two years, and it has made great efforts to provide financial relief to rural areas in various counties. This year, Hubei Province has had a bumper harvest of agricultural products, and the rural situation has slightly improved. The committee has formulated specific plans for the future development of cooperative undertakings. According to the person in charge of the committee, "This committee was established two years ago in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters, and the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters designated responsible personnel to organize the Rural Cooperation Committee. Jia Shiyi, the Director of the Finance Department, was specially responsible for handling it and achieved considerable results. Finally, Jia resigned from his concurrent post due to busy affairs, and the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters reassigned Liu Shoupeng, the Director of the Construction Department, to take over as the Chairman of the committee and ordered the Farmers Bank to coordinate the loans to serve as the foundation for establishing rural cooperatives in various counties. Currently, the cooperatives established by this committee include ten counties: Huanggang, Xiaogan, Xishui, Yingshan, Yunmeng, Anlu, Xianning, Jiayu, Suixian, and Zaoyang. The sixteen pre-cooperatives hosted by the former Rural Financial Relief Office (Yangxin, Chongyang, Echeng, Daye, Tongshan, Tongcheng, Mianyang, Jianli, Qianjiang, Enshi, Hefeng, Huang'an, Lishan, Macheng, Yingshan, Luotian, etc.), and the eight cooperative societies of Wuchang, Hanyang, Hankou, Huangpi, Huangmei, Yichang, Hanchuan, Jiangling (loans by Huayang Yizhenhui and managed by The Farmers Bank of China) have all been transferred to the committee. The sum is 37 counties. As of the end of June, a comparison of the foreign currencies loaned by the cooperatives of the 37 counties with the foreign currencies returned shows that one-third of the loans has been repaid. This year, the agricultural products of various counties are very abundant, and the repayments should be even more enthusiastic, which is very beneficial to the social, economic, and economic life of the people. The Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters, in view of the fact that the Hubei border area has been plagued by red bandits and continuous droughts for many years, has specially ordered the committee to send personnel to guide and promote the social affairs of eastern Hubei and establish a cooperative treasury. It has now achieved considerable development. In the future, it is planned to establish offices in the county division areas, and the cooperative administration will be handled by the affiliated district offices in charge, so as to realize the practical effect of cooperation."

<p>Peng Guoyan, residing at No. 623 Shantung Street, formerly the county magistrate of Wuxian, Jiangyin, and Pixian counties, whose son, Lin Sheng, only two years old, died of illness last month. His wife, Xu Xianmin (currently a member of the Wuxian Women's Association), believes that it was caused by Zhou Songfan, a pediatrician of Western medicine, who did not understand the cause of the illness and neglected his duties. Therefore, out of love for her son, she repeatedly decided to publish in the newspaper to express her dissatisfaction with Zhou Songfan. At that time, Zhou entrusted Zhang Yi, Liao Wuzi, Shen and others to mediate, but it failed. Zhou Songfan preemptively filed a lawsuit with the District Court against Peng Guoyan and Xu Xianmin for defamation. On the morning of the 19th, Judge Shen opened the court for trial. The plaintiff, Kai Songfan, reported with his lawyer, Wu Chao. The defendants, Peng Guoyan and Xu Xianmin, also reported with their defense lawyers Jiang Zhu and Lu Xiangru. There were many people in the audience. After an interrogation, Judge Shen guided both parties to reconciliation. Because Peng and Xu were unwilling to express their apologies in court, the reconciliation failed. The court ordered both parties to return and wait for a scheduled continuation of the trial. However, Peng Guoyan decided to sue Zhou Songfan to the District Court for neglecting his duties and causing death, requesting that he be brought to justice.</p>

<p>Recently, theft has been rampant in various urban and rural areas of Wuxian County, and bandits are rampant. The Public Security Bureau has repeatedly received reports, but it is difficult to capture them. On the 17th, it was reported that three robbery cases occurred continuously in Guangfu, Huguan, Weiting and other villages. As many as six or seven families have been robbed in Guangfu Township. Because the place borders Taihu Lake, the bandits fled to Taihu Lake. A robbery also occurred in Xiza Township on the evening of the 18th. The victim was the farmer Fu Yuye, who lost more than 200 yuan. Zhou Zonghao's family in Guihualong, Pingmennei, in the urban area was stolen in the middle of the night on the 18th. A large number of jewelry and other items were worth more than 3,000 yuan. The public security organs divided up and hunted overnight, but found nothing.</p>

<p>Zhang Da, the Director of the Public Security Bureau of this county, due to the reorganization of the police administration district system, transferred 184 police officers from the original branch chiefs and police officers to the province for training. The police officers, unwilling to go to the province, petitioned the county bureau, requesting the issuance of gratuities for dismissal. At that time, there were no results, which led to a city-wide strike. Local security was maintained by security team members and student police officers sent by the province. Details of the process have been recorded in this newspaper. Now, it is known that County Magistrate Long Tiyao has repeatedly summoned the police officers to speak with them. On the night before last, at about 10 o'clock, he sent eleven county government officials to divide all the police officers into eleven groups, and talked to them individually in the Wenxi Hall, asking if they were willing to be transferred to other counties by the province. As a result, 67 people were willing to go to the province and be transferred to other counties, and 55 people were unwilling to go to the province. Yesterday (the 19th), in the early morning, the general bureau assigned 150 student police officers to serve in various branches, with 30 to the first branch, 40 to the fifth branch, 30 to the fourth branch, and 50 to the third branch, all stationed on the roads and main thoroughfares.

<p>Personnel from the Supervision Department of the Bengbu Public Security Bureau recently led detectives to the Tongji Pharmacy on the main street of the city, where they seized a large number of highly toxic drugs and four wanted criminals: Zhang Huiqun (female), Xing Fengxiang, Zhang Hanjun, and Zhang Fashu. They were immediately taken to the bureau and detained. The authorities, considering the Tongji Pharmacy as the main organ for trafficking drugs, paid special attention to it. At that time, detectives were sent to investigate near the pharmacy. Suspects Shen Kaiwen and Hu Furen, who went to the pharmacy to visit, were also captured and taken to the bureau for custody. Director Lu Zongjing, considering the case to be serious, telegraphed the Anhui Provincial Government and the Fourth District Commissioner's Office separately. Subsequently, he requested medical experts to chemically test the seized four packages of drugs, which were proven to be a mixture of morphine essence and caffeine essence, a highly addictive narcotic drug that has long been strictly prohibited from trafficking. These sixty-six large packages of drugs weighed a total of 159 jin. At 7 a.m. on the 17th, detectives from the Supervision Department of the Public Security Bureau searched the pharmacy again, but found nothing. The police were dispatched to seal the pharmacy's gate, and the pharmacy's business was suspended.

<p>Supplementary Swearing-in for Groups: The citizen registration and swearing-in for staff of various professional groups and freelance professional groups have already been held. The National Election Office, fearing that there may still be omissions, has arranged for supplementary swearing-in in three locations throughout the day today. The first location is the General Labor Union, where all cadres, councilors, and labor union directors and supervisors of the various district farmers' associations and fishermen's associations who have not yet been sworn in will go to complete the procedure. The second location is the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, where all executive and supervisory committee members of the various trade associations who have not been sworn in will go to complete the procedure. The third location is the Municipal Education Association, where all members of the Accountants' Association, Journalists' Association, Physicians' Association, and various district education associations who have not been sworn in will go to complete the procedure.</p>
<p>Citizen Certificates Being Rushed into Production: Regarding the staff and members of various agencies and groups who have completed the citizen swearing-in registration procedures, citizen certificates must be issued in accordance with the law based on the oath registration forms, so that they can receive election tickets and enjoy civil rights in the future. The number of these citizen certificates is extremely large. The National Election Office has fully mobilized since the day before yesterday to work on this matter. After the completion of the filling, it can be announced for distribution. In addition, the preliminary elections for various professional groups and freelance professional groups (i.e., the executive organ staff of lower-level groups select candidates) will also begin according to the election procedures. Therefore, the internal work of the office has been extremely tense in recent days.</p>
<p>Qualifications of Group Members: The National Election Office received instructions from the General Office yesterday regarding the qualifications of group members to participate in elections. The original order stated that according to the request for interpretation of Article 19 of the Election Law, "The professional groups and freelance professional groups participating in the election shall be limited to those established in accordance with the law before the promulgation of this law." Whether the qualifications of new members are also limited to those legally determined before the promulgation of the Election Law are included in the meaning, according to this, after investigation, Article 19 of the Election Law has clearly stipulated that professional and freelance professional groups are limited to those established in accordance with the law before the promulgation of this law, then the qualifications of members who organize the groups and have the right to vote, in order to implement the legislative spirit of this article, should also be limited to those legally obtained before the promulgation of the Election Law, etc. The office has already notified and complied with this.</p>
<p>Supplementary Swearing-in for Journalists: The citizen registration and swearing-in of the Journalists' Association of this city was held on the 17th of this month at the association's headquarters. However, there are still many who were unable to participate due to circumstances. The association has now received a notice from the National Election Office that those who have not participated in registration and swearing-in on the prescribed date will be registered and sworn in throughout the day today (the 20th) at the Municipal Education Association at the South City Public Stadium. The National Election Office has appointed Tong Xingbai as the supervisor. The association, considering the matter to be related to citizens' rights and interests, has immediately notified all members who have not been sworn in. It is hoped that members who have not been sworn in will actively participate and not lightly give up their citizenship qualifications.</p>

<p>Liu Zhenhuan, who served as the Commander-in-Chief of the Guangxi Army and the Governor of Guangxi Province, etc., was summoned by telegram by Chairman Chiang to Lushan. On the 12th, he was received by personnel from the General Headquarters and left Lushan to go east, stopping by Nanjing to pay respects to the mausoleum and visit old friends in the central government. On the morning of the 17th, he flew from Nanjing to Shanghai. He originally planned to take the China National Aviation Corporation Shanghai-Guangzhou plane to Guangzhou at 6 a.m. on the 18th, but the flight was suspended due to poor weather in Hong Kong and Guangzhou, so it was postponed to 6:30 a.m. yesterday morning, when he still took the Shanghai-Guangzhou plane to Guangzhou. Those who went to see him off included Yang Hu, the Commander of the Songhu Garrison, and many of Mr. Liu's friends. According to Mr. Liu, speaking to a Central News Agency reporter, various news reports about Guangxi Province are inconsistent. In the end, what is the truth must be judged after an on-the-spot observation in Guangzhou. In short, the central government is magnanimous towards Li and Bai, and I hope that they will accept the new mandate so that peaceful unification can be realized as soon as possible to cope with the current serious national crisis.</p>

<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, the Central Mint was ordered by the Ministry of Finance in March of this year to start casting new copper-nickel subsidiary coins. After the first batch was cast, it was inspected and qualified before being released from the factory and circulated in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places. Due to the high demand in the market, the supply could not meet the demand. The factory has been working day and night to catch up with the casting. To date, more than 10 million yuan of subsidiary coins have been cast. However, with the unification of the currency system in various places and the sharp increase in the number of subsidiary coins needed, the number already cast is still insufficient. In order to adjust the currency system and finance and complete the legal tender policy, the Ministry of Finance has ordered the factory to continue casting a large number of subsidiary coins. Therefore, even in the hot summer, the factory has not stopped work. It is estimated that by the end of this year, the number of new subsidiary coins cast will reach 30 million yuan. It is reported that the current batch of subsidiary coins being cast by the factory will be shipped to Guangdong for circulation after being collected and delivered to the Central Bank upon release from the factory.</p>

<p>According to the Zi Lin Newspaper, a Chinese newspaper reported a piece about Mr. Marshall, Chairman of the Shanghai British Chamber of Commerce, in which he said that British residents in China do not oppose the Chinese authorities collecting income tax from them. This newspaper inquired with Mr. Marshall about the truth of this statement. Mr. Marshall directly and firmly denied this statement. A reporter from a certain Chinese newspaper asked Mr. Marshall to answer certain questions regarding income tax. During the conversation, Mr. Marshall denied that British residents had made any organized opposition to this tax, because they had not considered that under the current circumstances, this tax could be applied to British residents. Mr. Marshall admitted that in theory, the principle of income tax is very sound, but everything depends on how it is implemented. The most important condition is the ability to seriously collect this tax nationwide. Taxing only people's salaries is not taxing their income. He then mentioned the establishment of a bureau to discuss such matters. Mr. Marshall replied that such an agency cannot be established overnight, and requires careful organization. For example, if the people of Jiangsu pay this tax, while the people of Sichuan are exempt, it would be unfair to the people of Jiangsu, because this tax is national in nature. Moreover, this tax is for the central government, not for the provincial government. Mr. Marshall stated that what he said did not affirm that British residents approve of this tax.</p>

<p>The Shanghai County field and house deed tax, which was approximately 220,000 to 30,000 yuan last year, was previously ordered by the Finance Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Government to reduce the tax to 6.3% for sales and 3% for mortgages (originally 9.6% for sales), and repeatedly extended the deadline. The deadline expired again at the end of last month. Now the county government has received an order from the province, which states that the deed tax rate should be set as a permanent tax rate with a maximum limit of 6.3% for sales, in order to reduce the people's burden. The short-price and concealed tax penalties originally stipulated in the deed tax regulations of this province have been revised separately, and the regulations have been issued for compliance. After receiving the order, the county government, in addition to publicly announcing it, has instructed the township heads to comply and inform the people at any time to quickly complete the taxation of untaxed white deeds in order to consolidate property rights. Since the tax reduction, the people have been very enthusiastic about completing the tax payment. According to the sales deed price paid last year, there were approximately 220,000 to 30,000 yuan. It is also reported that after the tax reduction, all deed taxes and county taxes are allowed to retain one yuan within the sale deed tax of six yuan to offset education and public security expenses. The original surcharges may not exceed half of the regular tax.</p>

<h3 id="e92">The Chamber of Commerce Inquires with the Zhoucun Chamber of Commerce About Artificial Silk Fabric Conditions <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Zhoucun Chamber of Commerce yesterday stating, "Dear Sirs, on the 18th of this month, according to a letter from the Municipal Electric Machinery Silk Weaving Industry Association, members recently reported that Minghua Ge and Zhongshan Di from Zhoucun, Shandong, have recently been found in the Shanghai silk market in increasing numbers, and five to six thousand bolts are shipped to Shanghai every day, continuously being transported without end. After investigating their wholesale prices in Shanghai, Zhongshan Di (a fabric interwoven with rayon and cotton yarn) is priced at 3.3 yuan per 2.5 pounds, and Minghua Ge (a rayon fabric) is priced at 4 yuan per 3 pounds. These prices are vastly different from the selling prices of products from domestic silk factories in Shanghai. According to the Shanghai Di of the same type as Zhongshan Di, the cost of raw materials for every 2.5 pounds is at least 3.6 yuan. For products of the same type as Minghua Ge, the tax that should be paid for every 3 pounds of rayon is 4.2 yuan. However, their selling prices are not enough to cover the cost of raw materials in one case, and lower than the tax cost in the other. The source and reason for this dumping are truly surprising and must be investigated. The government's anti-smuggling efforts have been extremely strict recently, and the inspection of the rayon used in bolt fabrics is even stricter. However, it is extremely difficult to dissect and record the raw materials for each bolt of already woven fabric. Therefore, for finished products, it can only be allowed to be sold. However, with five to six thousand bolts of Zhongshan Di and Minghua Ge from Zhoucun being shipped to Shanghai every day by mail parcels, the rayon contained in those five to six thousand bolts is approximately seven to eight thousand boxes. How many boxes of rayon are currently in stock in Zhoucun? How many bolts of finished products are there? What is the cost of rayon? It is urgent to investigate the prices. The Zhoucun Chamber of Commerce should also sympathize with the anti-smuggling work. I hereby earnestly request your association to quickly forward this letter to the Zhoucun Chamber of Commerce, requesting them to investigate the types of raw materials, selling prices, costs, inventory quantities, tax payment situations, and whether they are complying with the regulations of the Ministry of Finance regarding the inspection of imported goods and the temporary regulations for transportation and sales, and the regulations for the inspection of rayon and local product bolt fabrics, issuing licenses, reporting to customs, and handling transportation and sales for the Zhongshan Di and Minghua Ge that are shipped to Shanghai every day without end, and to reply one by one in order to clarify the source and reason for their dumping. The matter concerns the inspection and investigation of the silk weaving industry, and I dare to ask for your investigation and handling, and please reply. Enclosed are two fabric samples and a dissection report." After investigating the raw materials required for rayon fabrics, they are all purchased from foreign countries, with tariffs and freight charges added. The costs required by your weaving factories should not be lighter than those of Shanghai factories. Why are the products shipped from your area to Shanghai for sale cheaper than the goods produced by local Shanghai factories? The weaving factories in Shanghai are suspicious of this situation. The factories are all run by Chinese, and they should have the friendship of caring for each other in difficult times. Therefore, I have enclosed a fabric sample and asked your association to investigate and clarify the situation as described in the original letter and to reply quickly in order to dispel doubts and maintain the business of the Shanghai factories.</p>

<p>According to the Shenshi News Agency, the Ba Mao River in Changshu is a crucial waterway connecting the Yangtze River and Tai Lake. It is of utmost importance for water conservation. The Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission, with the approval of the National Economic Council, allocated funds to construct the Ba Mao Mouth Floodgate to regulate the water flow appropriately. In January of this year, Kong Xiangxi, Standing Committee Member of the Economic Council and Minister of Finance, personally laid the foundation, after which construction began immediately. After more than seven months, the entire project is nearly complete. The floodgate is constructed entirely of reinforced concrete, with a height sufficient to withstand the highest tides of the Yangtze River. The height of the gate sill is 1.5 meters below the zero point of the Wusong sea level. The gate has five openings, and the gate body is 44 meters long. A bridge is built on the gate surface for the passage of cargo trucks with a load capacity of 2.5 tons. The gate is suspended and operated by hand-cranked machinery for opening and closing. The total construction cost is 300,000 yuan. According to information from the Shanghai office of the Economic Council, the floodgate project is now complete, and the council has sent personnel to Changshu for acceptance inspection. Whether or not a completion ceremony will be held has not yet been decided.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Personnel Detained in the Sorghum Wine Industry Are Released; Full Business Resumption Begins Today; Confiscated Wine Sent to the Bureau of Commodity Inspection for Examination; Punishment Will Be Imposed According to Regulations if Alcohol is Found to Have Been Used as an Adulterant <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Following the detention of personnel and goods from forty-two sorghum wine merchants, including Tongxinchang, by the Shanghai Inspection Office of the Suzhou-Zhejiang-Anhui District Consolidated Tax Bureau, and the subsequent suspension of business operations starting the day before yesterday, a bail arrangement was agreed upon yesterday morning. Personnel detained from Tongchangfu and Tonghe Yong wine merchants were released on bail, and full business resumption was approved starting this morning. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Suspension of Business and Transportation</p>
<p>After the Sorghum Wine Trade Association decided to suspend business and petition, representatives He Xiansheng and others negotiated with Section Chief Jiang of the Suzhou-Zhejiang-Anhui District Consolidated Tax Bureau and Section Chief Xia of the Shanghai Inspection Office and agreed that Lai Afang and Wang Ancai of Tongchangfu Wine Merchant, and Shi Agou and others from Tonghe Yong Wine Merchant would be released on bail. The bail procedures were processed the night before last, but because the Shanghai Inspection Office noted on the bail bond "private transportation of firewater adulterated with local sorghum wine," the wine merchants expressed opposition, which led to failure to release the detained individuals. The Association originally planned to resume business after the release of those detained from Tongchangfu and others, and immediately issue a notice to resume business. Because the detained personnel were not released yesterday morning, wholesale transactions remained suspended. As for the local sorghum wine transported to Shanghai from various parts of Jiangbei, transport was also uniformly stopped from yesterday morning. The wine loaded on the new local sorghum wine boats at the Shanbochang Bridge also stopped transporting. However, the retail departments of the various wine merchants maintained normal operations. But the operation of the wine merchants mainly relies on wholesale.</p>
<p>Release on Bail</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 10 am, the Association representative, He Xiang, again contacted Section Chief Xia of the Shanghai Inspection Office and agreed on a flexible bail arrangement. The bail procedures were then immediately processed. Lai Afang and others of Tongchangfu Wine Merchant were released on business bond at around 11 am. Shi Agou, who was detained with a wine boat from Tonghe Yong Wine Merchant, was also released on business bond at 5 p.m. yesterday. As for the confiscated wine, it was decided that the Shanghai Inspection Office would hand it over to the Suzhou-Zhejiang-Anhui District Consolidated Tax Bureau for forwarding to the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau for verification. If the verification clearly showed that it was alcohol adulterated with sorghum wine, punishment would be imposed in accordance with regulations. If no alcohol adulteration was found, it would be released immediately.</p>
<p>Resumption of Business This Morning</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency interviewed He Xiang, a member of the Association yesterday. According to him, the suspension of the local sorghum wine industry was due to the lack of knowledge of wine and personal integrity of the inspectors used by the Shanghai Inspection Office. Upon seeing a wine load, they considered the case to be in hand. Even the sub-director does not know good from bad wines, forcing businesses to first acknowledge and guarantee the use of alcohol as an adulterant. If the wine merchants did not provide this guarantee, the warehouse staff would be detained. They would be detained at the Shanghai Inspection Office during the day and sent to the police station at night until the Consolidated Tax Bureau completed its inspection, which could take one or two months. How could such administration not be heartbreaking? Therefore, as a last resort, we were publicly elected to petition the Consolidated Tax Bureau. The responsible section chief received us. The purpose of our petition was that the wine carriers are only responsible for delivering the wine. Since the wine has an owner, the staff should not be detained to avoid the innocent suffering. Merchants have reported to the inspection office for inspection and labeling. Re-bottled wines should not be detained midway. The two section chiefs approved our requests. Regarding the guarantee, they provided a guarantee to be summoned as needed. The detained warehouse staff from Tongchangfu were released at 11 a.m. The wine of Tonghe Yong, which had been detained for over ten days, was relocated by the inspection office. The detained wine and staff were released at 5 p.m. It was decided that business operations would be resumed starting on the 20th. The details of the bail application will be reported at a general meeting of the members.</p>
<p>Handling Measures</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency visited Section Chief Jiang of the Consolidated Tax Bureau again yesterday morning. According to him, the dispute in the local sorghum wine industry has been resolved in consultation with the Association representative, He Xiang, and others. Detained personnel were released on bail by the wine merchants. As for the confiscated goods, they would be handed over to the Commodity Inspection Bureau for verification. If no alcohol adulteration was found, the goods would be released immediately. If alcohol adulteration was found, the punishment would be imposed according to regulations. Article 2 of the punitive measures for adulterating local wine with firewater states that "Wholesalers who use large quantities of ordinary firewater to adulterate local wine for wholesale business shall be fined between 200 and 1,000 yuan." Article 3 states that "Retail shops that use firewater to adulterate local wine for retail sales shall be fined between 10 and 200 yuan." Article 4 states that "In addition to the penalties prescribed in Articles 2 and 3 of these rules, the seized goods shall be confiscated."</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Shanghai local sorghum wine industry, because of the Shanghai Inspection Office of the Suzhou-Anhui District Consolidated Tax Bureau inspectors, forcefully claimed alcohol was illegally used as an adulterant and made detentions. After the trade association’s resolution, businesses were temporarily suspended and representatives were sent to the tax bureau to submit petitions, as reported earlier. It is now discovered that the trade association dispatched representatives from Lao Heng Xing, Tongchangfu, Tongxinchang, Dafuyong, and eight other wine merchants to the tax bureau yesterday afternoon to submit petitions. Director Sheng of the bureau dispatched Section Chiefs Jiang and Qian to receive them. After each of the representatives detailed the petition, Section Chiefs Jiang and Qian reported to Director Sheng, who earnestly persuaded and stated that the bureau aims to benefit the country and convenience merchants. If illegal detentions, obstruction, extortions, and other matters involving the inspectors should occur in the future, the wine merchants are permitted to file factual charges, and the bureau will investigate and deal with the matter strictly according to law, without leniency. However, since firewater is more than twice as cheap as local wine, unscrupulous merchants use it as an adulterant, which greatly affects tax revenue. Earlier, the Ministry of Finance issued strict orders prohibiting the adulteration of beverages. To implement the ban and safeguard the livelihood of the brewers, future cases of adulteration will be punished in accordance with the regulations to maintain tax revenue. Each of the representatives happily dispersed because Director Sheng eradicated abuses, upheld fair business practices, and spared no effort.</p>

<p>To increase cotton farmer production and supply raw materials for fine yarn, the Zhejiang Construction Department divided the coastal areas of various counties in the province into cotton industry improvement implementation zones last year, focusing on promoting improved American cotton.

This year, the area for promotion in the zone has been expanded to over 30,000 mu, and the planting and production are excellent. The estimated output is 60% higher than last year, and this year's output of ginned cotton is estimated to be over 15,000 bales. The Zhejiang Provincial Agricultural and Forestry Improvement Station sent Director Cheng Bingquan to Shanghai to handle the transportation and sales matters, and to negotiate with the Cotton Industry Control Association, the Cotton Production Improvement Association, Shenxin Textile Mill, and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Sanbei Shipping Company, etc. regarding transportation and sales methods. All parties are willing to do their best to assist. Mr. Cheng returned to Ningbo yesterday due to the satisfactory results of the negotiation, and will start handling the transportation and sales matters.</p>

<h3 id="e107">The Autumn Flood of the Huangpu River; High Tides Are Stable; Water Levels Are Below Predictions; Shipping and Storage Companies Urge Removal of Stored Goods <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>According to the Huangpu River Conservancy Bureau, the highest point of the autumn flood tide of the Huangpu River this month was predicted to be midnight the day before yesterday. According to measurements, the quantity was 12 feet 8 inches. This morning, it was learned from the bureau that fortunately, it did not reach the predicted level. The water level was below the prediction. However, there will be high tides next month. The shipping and storage companies have been urging the removal of stored goods to prevent water damage. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Did Not Exceed Predictions</p>
<p>Because it is currently the autumn flood season, the tides of the Huangpu River are particularly high. According to the Huangpu River Conservancy Bureau's prediction, the tide on the night of the 18th (the day before yesterday) would be the highest, with a quantity of 12 feet 8 inches (the height of the bund embankment is only 13 feet), which is very important. This morning, it was learned from the bureau that the high tide last night did not reach the predicted level, but was only 11 feet 1 inch, 1 foot 1 inch lower than predicted. Therefore, during the high tide time, except for the rapid currents, the roads and embankments were not affected.</p>
<p>Next Month's Forecast</p>
<p>According to measurements, the quantity of today's and tomorrow's high tides is lower than the tide on the 18th. Therefore, if there are no strong winds and rainstorms, the high tides this month can be passed safely. As for the high tides next month, the bureau has also completed the measurements. The tides on the seven consecutive days from the 12th to the 19th will be the highest, with quantities all above 11 feet and 12 feet. In particular, the night tides on the 16th (predicted 12 feet 5 and a half inches), the 17th (predicted 12 feet 6 and a half inches), and the 18th (12 feet 6 inches) will be very high.</p>
<p>Urge Removal of Stored Goods</p>
<p>In addition, the Dada Shipping Company and the Datong Shipping Company announced, "To whom it may concern: The autumn flood is approaching and is difficult to predict. For goods stored by cargo owners in the company's own or leased warehouses, those stacked on the ground floor must be taken away or moved to another warehouse during the flood season. Otherwise, if there is any damage, it is an act of God and difficult for people to resist. The companies will not be responsible. However, within the possible range, we will do our best to protect them. The losses and expenses incurred due to the protection will still be borne by the cargo owners. This is a special announcement, for your information."</p>

<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, after the Shanghai Foreign Exchange Banks Association decided to reduce the foreign exchange commission for brokers from 1/16 to 1/32 starting on September 1, the Japanese brokers were the first to oppose it and requested the Foreign Exchange Brokers Association to file a complaint. The Brokers Association held a meeting in Shanghai and resolved to request a remedy. Now, after negotiation between the chairman of the Brokers Association and the chairman of the Foreign Exchange Banks Association, a flexible arrangement has been decided: (1) For foreign exchange transactions between banks, the broker's commission will be reduced to 1/32; (2) For foreign exchange transactions between banks and customer accounts, the broker's commission will remain at the current level of 1/16. The above arrangement will become official after it is approved by the Foreign Exchange Brokers Association and the Brokers Association sends a letter to the Foreign Exchange Banks Association.</p>

<h3 id="e109">Yang Jianzhong, an Important Witness in the Japanese Sailor Case, Was Interrogated Yesterday; Yang Firmly Denies Planting Evidence and Framing; Face-to-Face Confrontation with Yang Wendao in Court <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Yang Wendao from Guangdong was arrested by the police in the First Special District Court along with Ye Haisheng, Zhou Sherong, and others for being involved in the murder of Japanese sailor Nakayama Hideo. The court has repeatedly opened hearings to investigate the case. Because Yang initially admitted that the handgun and book found in his home belonged to him, but then suddenly claimed that his relative Yang Jianzhong planted the evidence and framed him, Yang Jianzhong became an important witness in the case. The court specially ordered the police to investigate and summon him for questioning. Since Jianzhong had already left Shanghai, it was difficult to obtain substantial evidence as to whether Wendao's accusation of planting the evidence was true. Until the other day, Yang Jianzhong turned himself in to the police, declaring that he was willing to go to court for questioning. Therefore, Judge Xiao Xiefen of the First Special District Court reopened the investigation hearing at 2 p.m. yesterday. Prosecutor Tang also attended the hearing to perform his duties. The Japanese side also sent military personnel to the court to listen. Yang Wendao's defense lawyers, Tang Huaiqun and Guo Qiming, also appeared in court one after another. Because only the book was being investigated, only Yang Wendao was escorted to court by the police.</p>
<p>The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that the defendant Yang Wendao admitted during the first and second preliminary hearings that the book with a hole dug in it to hide the handgun used to kill Nakayama Hideo, which was seized from his home, belonged to him, and that the hole in the book was indeed for hiding the gun. The police confirmed that the gun hidden in the hole was the gun used to kill the Japanese sailor. Yang only changed his previous confession during the third interrogation, claiming that the book found was planted by Yang Jianzhong in his home to frame him. However, he has not been able to prove this statement. Fortunately, Yang Jianzhong turned himself in to the police yesterday, claiming that although he and Wendao shared the same surname, they were not of the same clan. He did not know about Wendao's matters and could not have gone to his house to plant evidence and frame him. Since Wendao's arrest, he has been repeatedly threatened. To avoid danger, he left Shanghai. However, thinking that this matter could not be resolved by avoiding it for long, he resolutely turned himself in to clarify the truth. Yang Jianzhong has been brought to court, and the court is requested to investigate. The court then interrogated Yang Jianzhong, who stated that he was 53 years old, currently residing at No. 377, Hong An Lane, Lao Ba Zi Road. He and Yang Wendao were from the same family 700 years ago. Because they both belong to the Beishan Yang clan, they are members of the Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association, so they know each other. I call him uncle. Since meeting him at the Tongren Association operated by Wendao in August of last year, I have not seen him again. If I had ever been to his home, his family would certainly recognize me, and I could call them to identify me.</p>
<p>The court then showed Jianzhong the book with the hole for hiding the gun that was seized from Wendao's home. After viewing it, Jianzhong replied that he had never seen this book before, and never taught Wendao how to dig a hole in the book to hide a gun. He also said that I have tens of thousands of dollars in property, why would I need to borrow from Wendao. When questioned about Yang Wendao's statement, he said that in October of the 22nd year, I visited Wendao at the Taikoo warehouse. I happened to have a handgun that I had nowhere to store properly, and Jianzhong taught me how to hide the gun, saying that digging a hole in the book and hiding it would be the most appropriate. At that time, Jianzhong was wearing a woolen cap, not like the suit he wears now. I am his uncle, how could I frame him? The court then continued to investigate Jianzhong, who stated that he knew the doctor Zheng Huimin. On April 18th, Zheng came to the Beishan Fellow Villagers Association and saw the name Yang Wendao among the members. Zheng asked me if I knew Wendao's address, saying that the police wanted to find Wendao. At the time of the conversation, another member, Yang Guimei, wrote Wendao's address on a cigarette card and gave it to Zheng. Later, Zheng came to visit me again, saying that he had gone to the address and learned that Wendao did not live there. I then led Zheng to Yang Guimei's house, where they conducted their own inquiries. When Zheng first asked me, he did not promise me any reward if I found Wendao's whereabouts, nor did he explain the reason for looking for Wendao. Later, when Wendao was arrested, I learned about it from the newspaper. Unexpectedly, the atmosphere towards me has become increasingly bad since then, so I went to Guangzhou temporarily to avoid it. After returning to Shanghai, I traveled to Beijing, Hangzhou, and other places. Now, if this matter is not clarified, it will not only damage my reputation but also make it difficult to do business, so I specially turned myself in. However, Yang Jiaodao claimed that Yang Jianzhong told Yang Guimei that the police were arresting people very tightly and asked Guimei to come and inform him to flee quickly. Yang Jianzhong denied Yang Wendao's statement. Therefore, the two Yangs were confronted face-to-face. Judge Xiao announced that the court was adjourned because the investigation into this part had produced substantial results. Yang Wendao was still taken back to the police station for detention. Yang Jianzhong was taken to the police station's fingerprint office to have his fingerprints taken for verification according to law.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Last Night's Thunderstorm in the City - Heavy Thunderstorm Around the Fish Market Area - No Rain in the French Concession and Other Places <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The weather in this port city, after the start of autumn, though briefly cooler, suddenly became unusually hot again from the day before, resembling the heat of midsummer. Even at night, there was no coolness. As a result, the cold drink and watermelon markets were thriving again, and the general shack-dwelling poor were sleeping outdoors everywhere, with many suffering from heatstroke. Fortunately, true cholera was still rare. Around 6:40 PM yesterday, lightning flashed and thunder rumbled in the sky. Before long, dark clouds gathered, threatening a downpour. Around 7:00 PM, the rain fell heavily, immediately alleviating the heatwave and refreshing the spirits. After about twenty minutes, the rain gradually subsided, and by around 7:50 PM, the rain stopped and the clouds dispersed. Simultaneously, it was learned that there was a heavy thunderstorm in the Donggou fish market area. In the French Concession and Hongkou areas, one or two places did not receive any rain. Due to the rain, the air felt slightly cooler, but it was still quite stuffy inside the houses.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Rampant Water Bandits in the Jiangyin Area - Merchants Request Strict Apprehension - All Dressed in Gray Uniforms, Robbing <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>In the Yangtze River area along Jiangyin and Zhenjiang, water bandits frequently appear, and merchant ships traveling to and fro are often robbed. Previously, Yan Yongxiao, the director of the Shanghai Joint Office of the Zhejiang Eastern Saltpeter Boat Industry, submitted a report to the Fourth District of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police, requesting strict investigation and apprehension. Subsequently, an instruction was received stating that the area was no longer under the jurisdiction of the Fourth District and that a separate request should be submitted to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs. Xiao then prepared a document yesterday and submitted it to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, requesting the dispatch of police for investigation and suppression. The original text stated: "Submitting a report for the rampant activities of bandits and repeated robbery cases, requesting strict suppression to ensure the safety of merchants." This office has repeatedly received reports from its affiliated Jin Shun Cai Boat, Wu Tai Xing Boat, Xin Kai Tai Boat, Xin Heng Yuan Boat, Shen Zheng Xing Boat, Wang Shun Xing Boat, Wu Tong Xing Boat, Xin Fu Li Boat, Ma Wan Xing Boat, Xin Tong Xing Boat, Song Yi Xing Boat, Qian Shun Xing Boat, etc., stating that the boats transport goods from Shanghai to Nanchang, Zhenjiang, and other places. Along the way, in the area of about 200 kilometers between Jiangyin and Zhenjiang, they often encounter bandits at midnight. These bandits are usually seven or eight people, wearing gray uniforms and holding modern firearms. They jump from small sand boats onto the boats, claiming to inspect for contraband but in reality robbing. Afterwards, they leave triumphantly. Among them, the Qian Shun Xing Boat was robbed on the 30th of last month, and the boatman Shi Jinren was shot and seriously wounded, with a bullet through his palm. He is currently being treated in a Shanghai hospital. Based on this, this office prepared a document and submitted it to the Fourth District of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police, requesting intensified patrols and apprehension to bring the criminals to justice. Subsequently, on the 11th of this month, a reply was received stating: "The report is noted. Since the reorganization last year, the Yangtze River area is no longer under the jurisdiction of this district. The request to dispatch patrol boats and intensify patrols is difficult to comply with. You should submit the request directly to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs." In view of this, it is found that the area around Jiangyin and Zhenjiang is supposed to be peaceful and stable. However, since December of last year, robbery cases have occurred repeatedly. Moreover, these bandits are wearing gray uniforms and carrying firearms, daring to be blatant and rampant. Whether they are bandits or not is unknown. Judging from their actions and clothing, it is highly suspicious. Therefore, this document is submitted again, requesting your review and approval, and to order the dispatch of capable police officers to intensify patrols in the area before and after Jiangyin and Zhenjiang, especially during midnight hours, in order to curb banditry and ensure the safety of merchants. This would be a great act of kindness. Respectfully submitted to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, by Yan Yongxiao, Director of the Shanghai Joint Office of the Zhejiang Eastern Saltpeter Boat Industry."</p>

The monk has already agreed. The correspondence between them is transcribed below:</p>
<h3 id="e113">Letter of Invitation <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Reverend Master Baojing, I respectfully write to inform you that last year, we and others, recognizing that the disasters of the times are frequent and that only by promoting Buddhism can they be eliminated, initiated the organization of a Lotus Society on Mogan Mountain, with the goal of benefiting both oneself and others. After a year, it has fortunately been completed. However, considering that the position of president is of utmost importance at the beginning of the establishment, only those with grand aspirations and a resounding reputation can shoulder this important task. After deliberation, we have unanimously decided to invite you to take on the position of president and entrust you with full authority. It is clear that you are a renowned contemporary figure and are widely respected. We cannot help but admire you. We respectfully prepare this letter of invitation and sincerely hope that you will compassionately accept it and benefit all sentient beings. Share the remaining glow of Mount Tiantai to illuminate this land, and the old site of Jinzhong is destined to have a previous connection. Continue the unfinished wish of the late Master, and the joy of the Western Paradise is imaginable. By promoting the teachings of Master Si Ming Zun Zhe, the light of the Tiantai School will be boundless. The future of the Buddhist Association relies heavily on this, and the remedy for people's hearts depends on your guidance. We eagerly await your auspicious cloud and offer our heartfelt prayers. Respectfully wishing you peace. Zhang Renjie, Dai Chuanxian, Shi Zhizhao, Zhang Xiaolin, Huang Yingbai, and others, the initiators and founders of the Mogan Mountain Lotus Society.</p>
<p>Reply Letter</p>
<p>Jingjiang, Shengzhi, Xiaolin, Yingbai, and all great lay Buddhists, I have received your letter and respectfully acknowledge its kind intentions. I am unworthy and unqualified to be entrusted with the position of president of the Mogan Mountain Lotus Society. I respectfully admire your noble aspirations and great compassion. On the beautiful Mogan Mountain, you are continuing the legacy of Mount Lu, cultivating mindfulness of the Buddha, and upholding the Dharma in the degenerate age. You are riding the great vow boat to reverse the disasters of the coming age. Your merits are immeasurable, and everyone rejoices. Although I have inherited the robe and bowl, I have not received the transmission of the lamp. I lack eloquence and have no reputation. However, I am determined to help sentient beings and am compassionate. Moreover, I am repeatedly urged to take on this task. Therefore, I should lead monastics and lay followers to diligently practice Pure Land Buddhism and encourage the awakening of Bodhicitta. I hope that there will be a mutual response and that virtuous roots will be widely planted. May the sound of the bell be carried by the wind, and may the villagers commonly understand the teachings. May the bamboo path be filled with clouds, and may the great Bodhisattva's image be seen in this land. With utmost sincerity, I dedicate this merit to all of you. I respectfully reply to this letter and wish you pure joy. Huai Jing He Nan.</p>

<p>Shen Xingmin and Chen Qu from Ningbo colluded with the fugitive mastermind Wang Jinbao. Between the 29th of last month and the 12th of this month, they rented a side room at No. 540 Dong Youheng Road, hanging two signs outside: "Tian Er Film Company Preparatory Office" and "Affiliated Tian Er Dance Research Society." They advertised in newspapers to recruit dozens of actors, tea servants, etc. to practice filming, and defrauded them of guarantee deposits, meal expenses, and registration fees.

<p>Wang Huizhong, a local resident, 27 years old, lived at No. 79 Taopeng Road, Yangshupu. He had been working at the Municipal Council Donations Office collecting wharf donations for a year and a half. He had his father, Wang Yongkui, and mother at home, and he had just married his wife two months ago. Wang Huizhong had requested to be transferred to another position because of the danger of traveling back and forth on the river, and the request was being reviewed. At 8:00 AM the previous morning, Wang Huizhong went out to work and suddenly said goodbye to his wife, "I'm going out now, don't cry." The family thought it was a joke and didn't take it seriously. Unexpectedly, it turned out to be a prophecy. At about 10:10 AM, Wang Huizhong and his Indian assistant went to the Huishan Wharf and were recording the ship numbers when a large wave swept over. Wang was standing by the ship, and the wave knocked him off his feet and drowned him. The water police immediately fished him out, but he was already dead.

<p>Chen Liting, a Cantonese, opened a Guangdong native products company at No. 290, Henan Road, and employed his nephew Chen Peiquan (also known as Gan Chao) as an accountant. In the spring of this year, Chen Liting left Shanghai for business and handed the key to the silver box to Peiquan. However, fearing that there might be something wrong, he placed valuables in a small iron box, which was placed inside the silver box. However, the key to the small iron box was given to his son, Chen Runtai, for safekeeping. Chen has now returned to Shanghai, and all accounts are now managed by himself, and Chen Peiquan also returned the key to the silver box. However, Chen Peiquan had harbored bad intentions for a long time. When his uncle handed over the key, he secretly made another key. On the 6th of the month, taking advantage of Chen Liting's unpreparedness, he used the key he had made to secretly open the silver box and steal two Yida Bank checks, two Hongxiang Bank checks, and one Bank of China check placed in the small iron box. He also stole Chen Liting's seal and filled in the amounts, totaling 9,100 yuan, and withdrew them separately. On one side, he opened a Xiangyu firm at No. 378, Beijing Road. A few days ago, Chen Peiquan filled in the amount of 75,000 yuan on one of the remaining Hongxiang Bank checks and entrusted the Bank of China to collect it from Hongxiang Bank. After receiving the check, Hongxiang found that Chen Liting did not have such a large amount of deposit and notified Chen Liting by telephone for inquiry. Chen Liting discovered that the checks had been stolen and reported it to the General Patrol Room. Under the investigation of Chinese detectives Li Jincheng and Sun Jishan, it was discovered that Chen Peiquan had committed the crime. He was arrested yesterday. It was found that 1,000 yuan of the 9,100 yuan that had been withdrawn had been spent, and the rest was deposited in various banks. Some of the stolen items were hidden in the home of Wang Jiangong at No. 160, Yongfengfang, North Sichuan Road. The police arrested Wang and searched out some of the stolen goods. Yesterday morning, the case was sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang prosecuted in accordance with Article 321, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law and requested an extension for further investigation. After Judge Feng Shide's interrogation, he ordered the case to be adjourned for another week. Wang Jiangong was allowed to provide a guarantee to be available for questioning at any time.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Wheat Exports - Request for Prohibition - First Special District Joint Association Submits to the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Industry <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The First Special District Citizens' Joint Association, in order to request the swift issuance of a ban to prohibit wheat exports in order to maintain the national economy and the people's livelihood, specially submitted reports to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry yesterday. The original report stated: "Submitting a report to request the prohibition of wheat exports in order to maintain the national economy and the people's livelihood. Our country is an agricultural country. Due to frequent floods and droughts, production is insufficient, resulting in the intrusion of foreign rice and wheat into the market, forming a huge drain on the national economy. This year, due to the great climatic harmony, the wheat-producing areas of Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Shandong provinces have all reported bumper harvests. However, Japanese merchants take advantage of our low wheat prices and purchase it in large quantities, and unscrupulous Chinese merchants are helping to fuel the situation. It is heard that those transporting for export have already reached 300,000 dan, and Japanese merchants are still continuing to purchase. This matter has a profound impact on the future of the people's food supply and the flour industry. We believe that in order to reasonably solve the wheat export problem, we should internally examine the domestic food needs and externally observe the world wheat market, so that we will not incur debts. This association believes that wheat should be prohibited from export today. The reasons are as follows: According to wheat as a raw material for flour milling, the raw materials of flour mills in Shanghai, Wuxi, and other places have always relied on the wheat production in the Yangtze River basin, which can only be used by flour mills for seven or eight months. Although the wheat production in Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Shandong, and other provinces has a bumper harvest this year, the Yangtze River basin is still average. If we immediately recognize that there is an excess and allow it to be exported at a low price, then the raw materials of the flour mills will be exhausted in an instant, and we will have to repurchase high-priced foreign wheat for relief. Between one export and one import, the loss is very large. Moreover, the flour mills can expect to be prosperous in foreign sales due to the low cost of domestic wheat. This is from the perspective of the flour mills established by the Chinese people, and the export should be prohibited. Those who advocate wheat exports argue that the cheap grain hurts farmers, believing that excess domestic wheat will inevitably lead to a sharp drop in wheat prices, which will affect the economy. However, they do not know that there has been frequent famine in the country for years, and the people lack food reserves. Not only is there no fear of excess, but it is still difficult to be self-sufficient. At the same time, Chinese flour mills are relying on domestic wheat for supply, and the supply and demand are appropriate. There is no concern that wheat prices will be too low. Today, if we sell wheat at five yuan per dan, and then buy foreign wheat at more than five yuan, is it not enough to worry about the impact of expensive grain on the people's food? This is from the perspective of the people's food supply, and the export should be prohibited. At a time when the international situation is becoming increasingly urgent, national defense food is extremely important. If we do not control it and allow people to buy it, then once something happens, the country will lack food, and how can we maintain the morale of the army and the people? Therefore, even if there is an excess of domestic wheat, it should not be exported. This is from the perspective of national defense food, and the export should be prohibited. In summary, all of the above shows that wheat exports have many crises. Therefore, we especially request your ministry to quickly issue a ban to prohibit wheat exports in order to maintain the national economy and the people's livelihood. We are anxiously looking forward to it. Respectfully submitted to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry."</p>

<p>At 8:40 PM the day before, Liang Yaoting, an inspector of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Unified Tax Bureau Inspection Office, seized Zhang Qingyu at the intersection of Luxiangyuan Road for carrying a large jar of smuggled wine. He immediately arrested him with the assistance of the police. However, at the entrance of the police station, Zhang, fearing punishment, pushed down a jar of wine, causing the jar to break and spill all over the ground in an attempt to destroy the evidence. After being brought to the police station, it was learned after interrogation that the case was related to smuggling and that he was allowed to be brought back for interrogation.</p>

<p>Wu Liang, a 45-year-old woman from Anhui, was working as a maid at No. 24, Jianye Lane, Fuli Road, French Concession. Wang Shen, a 34-year-old woman from the same village, was also working as a maid at No. 25 in the same lane. The two women lived next door. At 10:00 AM on the 18th of this month, the two women were drying clothes on the drying platform. Wu Liang pointed out that Wang Shen had stolen her clothes-drying bamboo pole. The two started a conflict, arguing and quarreling. Then they started fighting each other, and the sound reached the lane. Xin Guanglun, a police officer at No. 242 in the lane, rushed to mediate. However, Wu Liang was ruthless and vicious, biting off half of Wang Shen's right ear with her mouth, causing blood to flow. The police officer reported it to the Lujiawan Police Station, which sent detective Lu Zhenduo to arrest Wu Liang. The bitten-off ear was placed in a medicine bottle as evidence, and Wang Shen was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Yesterday, the police station sent Wu Liang to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. Yao Zhaodi, a lawyer from the Police Department, presented the case and requested an extension to wait for the victim to recover from her injuries before investigating and prosecuting the case. Then, the handling detective reported the incident and presented the bitten-off half ear. Questioned by Wu Liang, she confessed that the plaintiff had first hired someone to hit me. Her ear fell off after she bumped into the iron door. Judge Sun Pengxian approved the confession and ruled that the hearing would be adjourned to the 26th. The defendant was remanded in custody.</p>

<p>Zhang Yueqin, a female drum singer from Hebei, was invited to Shanghai last winter to perform at the Central Hotel on Fuzhou Road. She became involved with Wang Chenglu, a salt merchant from Anhui residing in Shanghai. Wang intended to take her as a concubine, but they could not agree on terms. As a result, the woman committed suicide by taking poison on June 19th at the Xindu Apartment in Daode Lane, Beile Road in the French Concession. The Special No. 2 Court dispatched personnel to investigate and verify the circumstances. Later, Wang provided funds for the woman's father, Zhang Haishan, to arrange for the coffin and burial. This was previously reported. However, after Yueqin's death, Wang promised to settle the living arrangements for the woman's parents, so Zhang Haishan, the father, exonerated Wang at the verification site. Contrary to expectations, after the body was coffined and buried, Wang broke his promise and disregarded the living needs of Zhang Haishan and his wife, Madam Zhang Zhao. Zhang Haishan believes that his daughter was seduced and killed by Wang and that he himself was tricked. Unwilling to accept this, he recently hired a lawyer to file a complaint in the Criminal Court of the Special No. 1 Court, accusing Wang Chenglu of causing death with the intent of adultery, according to Articles 298, Section 2 and 302, Section 2 of the Criminal Law. The complaint states that the defendant Wang Chenglu, a native of Anhui, with the alias "Master Taotan," is 34 years old this year and resides at No. 14 Jingyu Lane, Weihaiwei Road. He is currently the General Manager of the Dayuan Salt Factory. Last winter, the plaintiff's daughter, Yueqin, was invited to Shanghai to perform at the Central Hotel for a monthly salary of one hundred yuan. After the two-month term, she was hired to perform at the Xiao Guang Han theater. At that time, Wang Chenglu came to listen to the performances and, seeing Yueqin's beauty, harbored intentions of seduction. Initially, he used ordering songs to display his wealth, and then he frequently gave gifts to show his attentiveness, causing the vulnerable woman to fall into his trap. He then had relations with her at No. 10 and No. 31 Xindu Apartment, No. 1 Daode Lane, Beile Road in the French Concession. From then on, the two secretly engaged in intimacy, sharing meals and lodging. Just as the two were passionately in love, Wang Haiting, the manager of the Nanjing Confucius Temple branch of the "Yet World", planned to send her to perform in Beijing. Yueqin went to Beijing in April of this year. In less than a month, Wang Chenglu sent Sang and Yang to Beijing to bring her back. Because the contract was not yet complete, Sang and Yang secretly plotted to bring her back to Shanghai. However, when they arrived at Nanjing Station, "Yet World" found out and sent people to bring Yueqin back. Sang and Yang brought the luggage and clothes to Shanghai and stored them at home. Yueqin was unable to perform in Beijing, so she also came to Shanghai. Wang Chenglu offered to pay one thousand yuan to take Yueqin as a concubine. The plaintiff couple, having only one daughter, were unwilling to sell her as a concubine for a thousand yuan and firmly refused. However, Yueqin's will was weak and she was seduced by Wang's money and power. On June 19th of this year, feeling that good things would not come to fruition, she committed suicide by ingesting opium. The defendant sent her to the Niu Min Sanatorium on Weihaiwei Road for treatment. Because the poisoning was severe, she died on June 20th. The defendant arranged for the coffin and burial at No. 4930 Jiangning Public Cemetery on Xinza Road. On July 22nd, the defendant sent Sang and Yang to return Yueqin's luggage. It was discovered that many items of clothing were missing. The death of their daughter was entirely caused by the defendant. They requested that the defendant be punished according to the law and requested incidental civil proceedings, demanding compensation of 24,000 yuan (calculated based on Yueqin's monthly salary of 200 yuan for ten years). The court, upon receiving the complaint, summoned the plaintiff Zhang Haishan and his lawyer to the Criminal Court No. 2 yesterday morning, presided over by Judge Chen Shuoying. The defendant did not appear. The court questioned the plaintiff and ruled that he was not a direct victim and could not sue according to the law. Therefore, the case was dismissed.</p>

<p>Hot Water Bottle Manufacturing Industry: The Hot Water Bottle Manufacturing Trade Association had previously severely and repeatedly addressed the issue of industry sales prices, and had filed with the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for record.

<h3 id="e128">Meat Sold in Vegetable Markets Must Be Deboned; Butchers Oppose; Cattle and Sheep Trade Association Asks Chamber of Commerce to Negotiate for Cancellation <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the butchers in the Hongkou vegetable market of this city received a notice from the Public Works Department's Health Department yesterday, prohibiting the deboning of meat in the vegetable market from today. All the butchers are strongly opposed to this, and the situation is very urgent. The letter from the butchers requesting the Cattle and Sheep Trade Association to ask the City Chamber of Commerce to negotiate for cancellation is excerpted as follows: A humble submission from member associations: It is reported that the Municipal Council Health Department has instructed our butchers to transport the butchered meat to the fresh meat market established by the department for deboning and wholesale and retail. In addition, each cow must increase the cost by one yuan and three dimes five cents, which is a total of two yuan and three dimes five cents with the slaughter fee of one yuan. This method is cumbersome, the burden is too heavy, and it hinders business. We have already described the difficulties and requested your association to negotiate for cancellation. As a result, an agreement was reached with the Health Department that our butchers would pay the fee, with each cow paying a total of one yuan and five dimes with the slaughter fee, and beef, mutton and pork would each increase by five dimes. The original livestock maintenance fees and hot and cold water fees stipulated by the slaughterhouse are now included in the one yuan and five dimes. The cold storage in the fresh meat market is allowed to store fresh meat for free within a week, and is allowed to be exempt from entering the market for work. The burden of the fees is already unbearable. However, in order to avoid the various difficulties of the fresh meat market, members are willing to pay the fee of one yuan and five dimes per cow, which is already a strain. Unexpectedly, only a few months later, the Municipal Council Health Department changed the previous agreement and issued a notice on the 5th of this month, stating that from today onwards, the deboning, trimming and packaging of meat are strictly prohibited in the Hongkou vegetable market and must be carried out in the Municipal Council's meat market specifically for this purpose. This is hereby announced. Reading this, we are deeply horrified. If this system is implemented, members will have to spend a lot of procedures and time, and will suffer from the pain of hindering business, which is really unbearable. Therefore, the difficulties are once again presented to your association. The members slaughter cattle and sheep in the Municipal Council's slaughterhouse, and the slaughterhouse transports them to the vegetable market for deboning and retail sales. The work has been going on at the same time without any differences. However, the Municipal Council has set up this new system. Now, the members must first transport the daily slaughtered meat to the fresh meat market established by the bureau for deboning, and then transport the deboned meat to the vegetable market for sale. This method is extremely difficult and is definitely an impossible fact. Usually, meat is sold every morning at two or three o'clock. The meat must be transported to the vegetable market, deboned and sold to facilitate business. If it is first transported to the fresh meat market for deboning, it will be past the time of purchase and sale, and the meat will be discolored due to multiple handling and frequent movement, and it will easily breed mold. If it is said to be hygienic, it will be counterproductive. According to the hygiene of citizens' meat consumption, there will be obstacles. Moreover, meat buyers often buy meat that has not been deboned (catering companies, Chinese and Western restaurants, and Chinese and Western people often buy it) for cooking. If the bones are removed before the sale, buyers will inevitably sigh at the disappearance of the market. The quantity and quality of the goods sold by members will inevitably shrink. Both supply and demand will be affected. In addition, multiple transfers, frequent transportation, and increased losses are even more unbearable. In addition, the slaughterhouse in the French Concession transports the meat to the Hongkou vegetable market for sale. The bones and meat must be connected before they can be split to the industry. If deboning is not allowed in the vegetable market, it is tantamount to prohibiting the transportation and sale of the meat. The business of our industry will inevitably be reduced. This is also a difficult end. Moreover, members in the same industry often have the fact that there is a surplus in this place and a shortage in that place, or a surplus in that place and a shortage in this place. They split each other to make up for the shortage every day. If the bones have been removed in advance, there is no way to adjust the surplus and the shortage. Those who are short will inevitably reduce their business, and those who are surplus will have no way to sell them. Both parties will suffer. Because members in the same industry must have bones and meat connected to each other in order to meet the market, this is also a difficult task to remove the bones before the sale. The reason for the members' opposition lies in this. If this system is implemented, the direct and indirect losses of the members will be indescribable. As for the members, they rent shops and stalls from the Municipal Council and have signed all the regulations to abide by. It is not much different from renting houses and doing business in other cities. Check the landlords and shops, rent them to others, and have stipulated certain procedures when signing the lease. If the shop is handled after the rental, it is the business of the lessee, but there has never been a case where the tenant is rented and then arbitrarily increases the harsh rules and arbitrarily interferes. When the members rented the stalls, the vegetable market regulations did not have such harsh rules. Now, they arbitrarily change the rules, which is no different from the landlord and the shop renting out the shop and then arbitrarily interfering and hindering the tenant's business. Members feel all kinds of difficulties, and it is really difficult to comply with this system. If the authorities do not understand and force the implementation, the members can only accept the sacrifice of closure and swear not to accept the new system that wastes time, hinders business, wastes transportation costs, and hinders hygiene. If the Municipal Council builds this building as a fresh meat market and the butchers do not use it, it is a pity, it can be used for other purposes. Why must it be unchanged and forcibly used for the needs of the meat market? Things are precious because they are applicable. If they are not applicable and forcibly used, is it not equal to the disadvantage of cutting the feet to fit the shoes? It is not only useless, but also harmful. Now, the fresh meat market is not suitable for the needs of our butchers. If we force it to be used, the harm will be very serious. Therefore, we humbly submit that we beg your association to quickly appeal to the Municipal Council to revoke it, and also ask the City Chamber of Commerce to send a letter to negotiate and must achieve the purpose of cancellation before it is over. So, the industry association finds that the Municipal Council's efforts to build a fresh meat market and to have the butchers transport meat into the market to organize various tasks such as dividing meat and removing bones are well-intentioned, but because the fresh meat market is too far away from the small vegetable market, there are many obstacles. The extension of the ancestral period, the obstruction of business, the increase of unnecessary transportation costs, and the damage to the original quality of meat are all hindering the butchers. The business is really suffering a great loss. The members of the association have repeatedly called for revocation, and it is also appropriate. In order to maintain the business of its members, the association, based on the previous situation, has appealed on behalf of the members. In addition to sending a letter to the Municipal Council to apply for revocation, it also asks the Municipal Council to understand the business situation and revoke it immediately. It is a public concern. I humbly submit it to Wang, Chairman of the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<p>At 7:20 last night, the electric wire along Fangbang Road in the city in front of the Town God's Temple suddenly broke and fell. It happened that Lao Ba (40 years old, from Nanjing), a fruit vendor on the roadside, was touched on his right arm by the broken electric wire and immediately fainted. Fortunately, a clerk from Dachang Candle Shop saw it and used a bamboo pole to pick it away, avoiding being burned to death, but he was seriously injured. The police officer on duty sent him to Shanghai Hospital for treatment and reported the incident to the police station for investigation.</p>

<p>At 5:00 PM at the Electric Bureau Radio Station, Mr. Wu Qiushi, named Qi, styled Xuanlou, a native of Chengdu, Sichuan, this spring, entrusted by General Wang Zhiyi, went to Beiping to invite Qi Baishi to visit Sichuan. Qi Baishi first went to Sichuan, Wu remained in Beiping, visiting Chuan Yuan Shu, Zhou Yang'an, Chen Banding, Hu Peheng, Yang Yugu and other celebrities. All people love to collect calligraphy, painting, ancient books, rare books, as well as ancient stone statues, are good at identification, can write poetry, like to collect ancient seals, are good at calligraphy, purely write cursive script in the style of Six Dynasties tablets, especially good at small regular script, and love to read banned books, such as the poetry collections of Tu Weizhen, Yuan Zhonglang, Yan Weizhong, and Ruan Daoyue of the Ming Dynasty, and have been studying the study of epigraphy for more than 30 years, and the epigraphy addiction is especially deep, to the point of neglecting sleep and forgetting meals. He happened to be exhibiting at the Lishi Calligraphy and Painting Association. Wu's calligraphy, which was displayed at the association, numbered about a dozen pieces. This time he came to Shanghai, and had very good talks with famous calligraphers, painters, and connoisseurs in Shanghai. It is reported that Wu will go to Sichuan in a few days. After negotiation with the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, he will go to the Bureau's Broadcasting Station (call sign HOHC frequency 1300 kilocycles) at 5:00 PM today to give a lecture. It is admirable that he is dedicated to promoting culture in our country.</p>

<p>The large-scale calligraphy and painting exhibition of the Lishi Society has been published in the newspapers for several days. I was eager to go to see it, but I was too busy with trivial matters. Only yesterday did I take the time to go and see it. Sure enough, it was full of colorful lights and sparkling sights. It can be said that it is a grand gathering of the works of dozens of famous artists in Shanghai. Among them, the excellent works are too numerous to appreciate fully. For example, Zhang Dazhuang's old brush is scattered, Qian Huafu's Buddha paintings are full of ancient meaning, Yuan Songnian's spirit and form are both present, Zhang Shuqi's carefully crafted works, and Hu Zaobin's rich and meticulous works are all worthy of savoring and unforgettable. In calligraphy, Zhang Xiaolou's Zhang Paper Calligraphy Manual is powerful and spirited. It is not necessary to imitate Wu Jun to have a place of one's own. Fen Weng's large-scale tablet style, at first glance, seems to be imitating He Xiang, but in fact, the spirit and reason are transcended, and it is superior to the realm of the Han people. Li Que's calligraphy has many types and is excellent in all styles. His Wei stele streamers are indeed his family style, with a distant realm of the right beginning, similar to precise inspection. His big seal script, like the Lin Qian, is truly a spiritual journey of the three dynasties and never lingers in the two Lis. Regardless of Deng and Wang's suddenness, if he makes Qin seal script, such as Lin Qin Liangwen, then he must be the pen of the heroic and dangerous . His walking revolution imitates Lu Gong's large-scale work, which is especially a masterpiece. There is a great Mihai palace comment on the book Bin, the so-called dragons and snakes flying, and the eyes of the viewers are surprised. There are also small screens made by the Four Masters of the Song Dynasty, with the faces of each family lifelike. There is also a person in this book who can truly get the spirit of Su Shi. Tian Jizai's Lin Sanpan is also ancient, powerful, and very different from those who use small seal script to write Zhong Dingwen. There are many other joint works by various artists, which cannot be listed. I not only enjoyed the visual feast, but also opened my eyes. I happily recorded it. (Meng Jiao)</p>

He also excelled in seal carving, favoring plum blossom and bamboo motifs. He was highly regarded in artistic circles. He is now accepting commissions at the Xin Xue Hui She Bookstore on Jiaotong Road in this city. His rates are not high. It is known that members of society who wish to connect with him through the art of calligraphy will find a flourishing opportunity here, akin to a scenic route.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Disputes Over the Property of Xiangxuetang, Custodian Wei Xia Declares <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>According to Xinsheng News Agency, the fresh meat industry in this city has traditionally been divided into Shanghai, Ningbo, and Jiangsu factions. The Xiangyuntang Public Hall and all its assets are the common property of the Shanghai meat industry in the southern part of the city. The land certificate of the public hall was originally held by Yan Weixiao, and for more than ten years, things were peaceful. Unexpectedly, recently, Zhu Zhigao, Liu Zengxiang, and others intended to take out the land certificate to mortgage a large sum of money to build new slaughterhouses in the southern part of the city. However, Yan Weixiao, due to his custodial responsibility, insisted on refusing without the consent of the entire Shanghai meat industry. The two sides held opposing views, leading to each side publishing their arguments in the newspapers, causing unrest among the fellow meat traders. Who is right and who is wrong will eventually be judged fairly. The original letter of reply from Yan Weixiao to all members of the Xiangxuetang Public Hall is transcribed as follows:</p>
<p>"Regarding the matter of the Xiangxuetang property, I previously published a statement in the newspaper Shen Tong Sheng. Now, having read the urgent statements in response from more than eighty firms including Xinsheng Da and others on the tenth of this month, I, Weixiao, am filled with fear and trepidation. I humbly believe that my virtue is insufficient to convince people, my talent is insufficient to manage changes, and my disposition is extremely dull. Only because of the exhortations and entrustment of the late Qian Jinfusheng and Zhao Jun Shenrong and other seniors, was I entrusted with the custody of the property. As a member of our industry, I, Weixiao, cannot shirk my duty. Unexpectedly, over the years, the debts owed by the public hall have not been cleared. In the public hall meetings, my custody of the property has never been mentioned in the general assembly. In all matters of the industry, I, Weixiao, have always adhered to the old ways as my duty, and dared not easily change course. Yet, this small matter of building a house has led to this dispute. Firms such as Xinsheng and others have exhaustively attacked me, even saying that I am stirring up trouble, reversing right and wrong, deceiving my colleagues, burying my head in the sand, ignoring the facts, spreading rumors, and arbitrarily slandering me. It would not be difficult for me to file a complaint under Article 310, but I fear that infighting among colleagues will make us a laughingstock to outsiders. How can this be good for the industry? It is not that I, Weixiao, am willing to endure insults as if blind and deaf. Now, I will address each question raised, based on the facts, one by one as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the collapse of the public hall's building in 1927, the officials in charge of the year and month gathered the directors and repeatedly considered the matter. They all agreed that the dilapidated state of the public hall could not be tolerated for long, as it concerned the reputation of the industry and affected appearances. However, construction with accumulated funds would not be sufficient. Therefore, Qian and others were recommended to supervise and work with me, Gangxiao, to establish the Jiyi Company, raise funds, and assist in this righteous cause. Any member of our industry with the ambition could join as a Jiyi shareholder. At that time, Xiangxue Public Hall and the Jiyi shareholders each appointed representatives to sign a formal contract, which has been followed ever since. If the leaders had not planned and the colleagues had not supported it, then for more than ten years, my colleagues would have already reported and corrected it. Why wait until today to trouble you? This is the first response.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the question of whether the amount borrowed by Jiyi was stipulated in a contract, the contract specifying the amount of the loan is held by both the Public Hall and Jiyi. The original contract is naturally stored in the Public Hall. All of you are members of the Shanghai meat industry and can request to view it. Once seen, it will be clear, so there is no need for further explanation. This is the second response.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the question of how Jiyi was established and whether it was registered with the Ministry of Industry, the original story of the establishment of Jiyi Company has been clearly explained in the first item. The Ministry of Industry was not yet established at that time. Moreover, Jiyi was specifically created to raise funds for the construction of the public hall, and there was no need to have representatives for external communication. The names of the representatives are listed in detail in the original contract, as mentioned above, so there is no need for further elaboration. This is the third response.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the question of whether the fifteen people, including the Chief Director Qian, informed all colleagues and obtained their consent when they entrusted me, Weixiao, with the public hall's property, Chief Director Qian solicited the opinions of colleagues, and I, Weixiao, would not dare to accept the property title for safekeeping without public consent. Moreover, for more than ten years, there has not been a single dissenting opinion. What further response is needed? This is the fourth response.</p>
<p>(5) Regarding the question of why, after more than ten years of my custody, the public hall's annual income and expenses have never been announced, and how it still owes more than 11,000 yuan, and requesting that the annual income and expenses be announced, our public hall has always had an accountant who is specifically responsible for the huge sums of money. After the receipt of the house funds in the past, a certain amount was used each year to repay Jiyi. Both parties have records. Jiyi verified the records and there was no corruption. Since 1935, Qian and others believed that the public hall's accounts had not been cleared for a long time, and in order to quickly settle the debts and revitalize the public hall, they appointed other staff to collect rent and deliver it to Jiyi. The expenses of the public hall were paid by Mr. Zhu Zhigao. Both parties have records to prove the expenditures, which can be verified with the public hall. This is the fifth response. As for the statement that the common property of all industries in the city is currently rotated among custodians, with a maximum term of four years, I, Weixiao, have limited knowledge and experience, and I do not know the basis of this regulation. In short, Zhu Zhigao, Liu Zengxiang, and others have repeatedly expressed their intentions to me, Weixiao, recently, urging me to hand over the land certificate of Xiangxuetang for mortgaging a huge sum of 30,000 yuan to the bank. Therefore, I, Weixiao, dare not hand it over lightly. Moreover, the property management committee that they formed has not gone through legal procedures, convened meetings, or obtained the consent of the entire Shanghai meat industry. Furthermore, it has not been reported to the party and government agencies to send personnel to supervise. It is entirely manipulated by a small number of people, presenting a deceptive organization. As for the twenty-odd families out of more than eighty families who sent letters opposing my, Weixiao's, handing over the land certificate to mortgage at the bank, they are now listed in the announcement, which I, Weixiao, cannot understand. In order to clarify the truth, in addition to publishing this response in the newspaper, I also hope that you will investigate and send copies of this letter to the more than eighty firms, including Xinsheng Da. To all colleagues in the Xiangxuetang Meat Industry Public Hall."</p>

Since its production, it has been tried by many people, who all believe that it is cool and refreshing upon entering the mouth, and that brushing with it is refreshing. It has unique benefits for oral hygiene.

<p>— Edited by China Trust</p>
<p>(Overview of Shanghai Industry and Commerce No. 34)</p>
<p>4.  Yi Hua Company—This company was established in September of the 22nd year of the Republic [1933], with its factory located at 1109 Connaught Road. It was a partnership organized by Yan Chuntang and others, with Yan serving as manager. The company produced sound films. Although the company's history is short, it has earned social praise for the quality of its products. The cost of each film often reaches 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. Its productions include more than ten films such as "Melee," "Woman," "Flame," "Golden Age," "Celestial Fairy," "Flying Flower Village," "Triumphal Song," "Hero of the Times," "Escape," "Rage of the China Sea," and "Incarnation Girl." The company has few basic actors, and mostly borrows them from other companies temporarily, with the salary being a certain amount paid for each film.</p>
<p>5.  Xin Hua Company—This company was established in the 24th year of the Republic [1935] and was a partnership operated by Zhang Shanxian, owner of the Gongwu Stage, and others. Initially, there were no basic actors. The director and actors signed contracts for one or several films. The company's productions are also very careful and the content is quite good. The films that have been released include "The Story of the Red Goat Hero," "The Peach Blossom Fan," "The Song of Everlasting Sorrow," and "Peach Garden Dream," all of which are box office successes. Zhang uses the profits from the Gongwu Stage as the company's working capital, so the financial situation is quite good. It is said that Hu Ping, Tong Yuejuan, and others have now been hired as basic actors.</p>
<p>6.  Kuai Huo Lin Company—This company was established in the 19th year of the Republic [1930] and was founded by Zhang Bingsheng, Shao Zhuanglin, and others, with Zhang as manager. The scope is quite small, with only one or two productions per year, so the company is not very noticeable to the public.</p>
<p>7.  Shanghai Company—Established quite early, it was once merged into Lianhua. In the 23rd year [1934], it became independent again and is now engaged in the production of sound films, with a small scope.</p>
<p>(5) Current Status of Film Distributors</p>
<p>Almost all of Shanghai's film distributors are foreigners. Only two companies are operated by Chinese: Huawei Trading Company and Youlian Film Company. Among the foreign-operated companies, American companies have the greatest influence because their film industry is the most developed. The following is a breakdown:</p>
<p>A. Companies Established by Chinese Capital:</p>
<p>1.  Huawei Trading Company—This company was established in March of the 18th year of the Republic [1929] with a capital of 50,000 yuan. It is located at 119 Renji Road and is a joint venture by senior staff of the Mingxing Company. Zhang Shichuan and Zhou Jianyun serve as managers, managing the productions of various companies in Shanghai, mainly those of the Mingxing Company. The annual turnover is approximately one million yuan.</p>
<p>2.  Youlian Film Company—This company was founded by Xu Bibo. The company's address was originally located on the self-described Swei Road. Before 1932, it also produced films and had more than thirty productions. After the Shanghai Incident of 1932, the film studio was destroyed and the shareholders had no intention of continuing. Currently, the company specializes in managing its past productions, so the scope of business is quite small.</p>

<h3 id="e144">German Chancellor Hitler Awards Honorary Medals to Our Delegation Leaders; Our Country's Future Sports Trends Will Take After Germany; Will Recommend Fifteen-Year Development Plan to the Government <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, August 18 (Kuomin Haitong News Agency) - German Interior Minister Wilhelm Frick, representing Chancellor Hitler, awarded honorary medals to Dr. Wang Zhengting, Chairman of the China National Sports Association, and Shen Siliang, Chief of the Chinese World Games delegation. Shen Siliang told the Haitong News Agency that "Modern sports in China developed relatively late, so we had no extravagant expectations for victory at the World Games from the beginning. But the greatest benefit for us was to understand the content of Germany's sports organization. China's future sports organization will also take after Germany. The Chinese Sports Association will hold a conference here to decide to recommend to the government a (fifteen-year plan) to develop Chinese sports."</p>
<p>When asked if the success of Chinese athletes at the World Games could be compared to the results at home, Shen said that due to weather conditions, the performance of the athletes at the World Games was worse than their results at home.</p>
<p>Shen also said that the organization of this World Games left a very good impression on everyone. He praised the organizational ability of the Germans and their hospitality.</p>
<p>When asked when the Chinese team would return home, Shen said that the football team was still playing friendly matches in Vienna and London. The rest of the team will gather in Naples on September 4 to return home.</p>

<h3 id="e145">Owens' Amateur Status to Be Lost <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>(Kuomin Haitong News Agency) Berlin, August 18 - According to Ferris, Secretary of the American Amateur Athletic Union, the amateur status of American sports star Jesse Owens, who won four gold medals at the 11th World Games, may be lost if he firmly refuses to participate in the British Stockholm Games, as he had registered to participate.</p>
<p>Ferris said, "Owens should go from London to Stockholm to participate in the games there, but he suddenly announced that he was considering accepting a $25,000 contract from the United States, which is enough to prove that, in principle, Owens is not opposed to becoming a professional athlete. According to the American Amateur Athletic Union's regulations, any amateur athlete who has registered to participate in a certain sport and then withdraws automatically loses their amateur status. According to this regulation, Owens may lose his amateur status because he has decided to take the Queen Mary to New York on August 19."</p>

<p>(IV)(X) Activities of the Chinese Athletes</p>
<p>The Chinese athletes arrived in Berlin on the morning of the 23rd. On the afternoon of the 24th, the entire group paid their respects at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, offering wreaths. Practice began on the 25th. Except for Jiang Bai of the soccer team, who had an eye ailment, the rest of the athletes were in good condition.</p>
<p>For athletes residing in the New Village, the cadre department has set a timetable: wake up at 6:30 AM (supervised by team management), raise the national flag at 7:15 AM (full uniform with trousers), breakfast from 7:30 AM to 8:15 AM, lunch from 12:00 PM to 12:45 PM, practice from 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM, lower the national flag at 6:15 PM (five participants), dinner from 6:30 PM to 7:15 PM, and bedtime at 10:30 PM. In addition, eight village rules are stipulated: (1) Be spirited, (2) Be graceful, (3) Be amiable, (4) Be neatly dressed, (5) Comply with village rules, (6) Obey instructions from Chinese staff, (7) Adhere to the schedule, and (8) Do not go out before the Games or on competition days.</p>
<p>Female athletes residing in the women's dormitory also observe the same rules.</p>
<p>Except for a dozen or so in Hamburg, members of the athletic observation group reside in camps along with observation groups from other countries. They hold meetings and listen to lectures by athletic experts from various countries every day. The work is extremely intense, and their lifestyle is just like that of soldiers, which everyone finds interesting.</p>
<p>Chief Delegate Wang Zhengting arrived in Berlin at 5:00 PM on the 24th with the American athletes. He visited the New Village at noon on the 25th with the Chinese Ambassador to Germany, Gan Tianfang, to express his regards to the athletes. That evening, he went to Hamburg and returned to Berlin on the 27th.</p>
<p>Chief Secretary Shen Siliang flew to London on the 25th to attend the Davis Cup meeting and is scheduled to return to Germany on the 28th. The martial arts team was invited to Hamburg on the 24th and gave three performances on the 25th and 26th, which were very well-received. They returned in triumph on the 27th.</p>
<p>The Chinese Students Association in Germany held a grand tea party at 8:00 PM on the 27th to welcome Dai Jitao, Zou Lu, Wang Zhengting, and the athletic delegation. Prominent figures from the German government and public were invited to participate in the fellowship. More than 500 people attended.陶鵬飛, the chairman of the student association, delivered a welcome speech, followed by speeches from Ambassador Cheng, President Dai, and the renowned German professor Franke. Finally, the martial arts team gave a performance, and Ms. Yong Zhujun and Mr. Wang Jizhou performed the Chinese opera "Wang Baochuan," concluding the evening with joy late into the night. Now, the original text of the speeches by Mr. Cheng and Mr. Dai are attached to the end of this dispatch.</p>
<p>Speech by Ambassador Cheng</p>
<p>Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, today the Chinese Students Association in Germany is holding a meeting to welcome Mr. Dai Jitao, Mr. Zou Haibin, Mr. Wang Rutang, and the staff of the World Games delegation. We are very pleased and honored to have German guests grace us with their presence.</p>
<p>This is the eleventh World Games, but the first time it has been held in Berlin. Its scale, the thoroughness of its preparation, and the number of participating units and athletes all exceed those of previous Games. The meticulous hospitality extended to athletes from various countries at the Olympic Village is evident, demonstrating the German government and people's emphasis on physical education and their dedication to their work, which is highly admired by foreign visitors. China is participating in the World Games for the third time, but in the eighth Games, there were only staff members, and in the tenth Games, only one athlete was sent. These previous instances were more of an observer-like nature. This year, there are 70 male and female athletes, 27 staff members, 9 martial arts performers, and 36 athletic observers, totaling 142 people. The chief delegate is former Foreign Minister Mr. Wang Rutang, and the National Government has specially appointed President Dai Tao to participate, demonstrating the importance of the event. This is unprecedented. Since the establishment of the new Sino-German treaty in 1921, diplomatic relations have been very harmonious. Now that the World Games are being held in Berlin, China's large-scale official participation further expresses our goodwill towards Germany. In recent years, Germany has shown a vigorous new spirit in every aspect, and in China, the New Life Movement promoted by President Chiang has spread throughout the country. The two countries, East and West, echo each other. After the Chinese delegation arrives in Germany, it will surely gain a deep understanding of Germany's new atmosphere on the sports field, in the dormitories, and at all public gatherings. The German people will also gain an understanding of the new life in China through the arrival of the Chinese delegation. Tianfang firmly believes that through this meeting, the people of the two countries will be able to understand each other better, and the friendship between the two countries will become even more amicable.</p>
<p>Having suffered the pain of the World War, we deeply hate and abhor war and think about how to eliminate it. However, some psychologists say that competition is human nature, so unless this nature is changed, war may not be avoidable. Tianfang believes that competition is indeed human nature, but we can find ways to make it go through the right channels without resorting to war. Sports events are the best form of competition. Participants compete fairly under established rules, which not only does not harm friendship but also enhances feelings. The Chinese philosopher Confucius explained this principle, saying, "The gentleman does not contend for anything except in archery." Modern sports events can also be said to be the competition of gentlemen. If we can only engage in the competition of gentlemen and abandon the barbaric and cruel war, then world peace can be maintained forever.</p>
<p>Mr. Dai Jitao is the first president of National Sun Yat-sen University, and Mr. Zou Haibin is the current president of National Sun Yat-sen University. This university is not only the largest university in China but also has a very deep relationship with Germany. Mr. Dai and Mr. Zou have always admired the development of German science, so National Sun Yat-sen University has hired many German professors over the years, which can be regarded as an organization to communicate Sino-German culture. This is enough to comfort German friends, and makes our welcome to Mr. Dai and Mr. Zou even more meaningful.</p>
<p>I wish Sino-German friendship a limitless future, and wish you all good health.</p>
<p>Speech by President Dai</p>
<p>Tonight, it is a great pleasure to gather with hundreds of compatriots in Berlin, especially with hundreds of strong and enthusiastic athletes and eager and diligent young students, and to have the most cordial fellowship with dignitaries from all walks of life in Germany. This is not only my personal joy, but I also deeply believe that when this great sincerity and loving spirit is transmitted to China, hundreds of millions of people across the country will be stirred up and cheer for it.</p>
<p>The Republic of China, which takes the Three Principles of the People as its highest principle, is gradually building a solid and firm foundation under the cultivation of sincerity, wisdom, benevolence, courage, and virtue. Our purpose is only to follow the teachings of Dr. Sun Yat-sen that "the world belongs to everyone," to build a rich, strong, and peaceful country, and to advance the world to great unity. Since the death of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, Mr. Chiang has led the nation in fighting for this cause for ten years as if it were one day. Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, all central measures have also been for this purpose. This time, with the spirit of national unity, we have organized the athletic delegation and the observation group to come to Berlin to participate in the World Games. Our purpose is not only to gain the benefits of observation in sports but also to seek the effect of mutual learning in the entire culture. The great spirit of the German people and the great achievements they have made are even more worthy of our reference. I believe that after the athletes and observers of our country who participated in the World Games return to the country, their contribution to the country and the world will create a most glorious achievement in the history of Chinese nation-building, and the cultural friendship between the people of China and Germany will be further strengthened. I wish you all good health. (Sent from Berlin on July 28)</p>
<p>(IV)(I) Berlin Before the Opening of the Games</p>
<p>Letters from Berlin to China are sent twice a week. Airmail is sent on Mondays and Fridays, and the Siberian Express is sent on Tuesdays and Fridays. I am rushing to send another report to the country. It is the eve of the opening of the Eleventh World Games.</p>
<p>The entire city of Berlin is truly in a state of frenzy for this event. Wherever you go, you see the symbols of the Games. Whoever you meet, the conversation is always about the Games. The population of Berlin was originally only four million, but this time, the number of people coming from all over the world to participate or visit the Games has reached eight million, more than double the original population. As a result, the prosperous city of Berlin has become even more lively and crowded.</p>
<p>The city administration of Berlin was originally at the forefront among the world's major cities. This time, to improve the city's appearance, all the buildings have been whitewashed and completely renovated, making them even cleaner and more orderly. Except for the occasional fallen and withered leaves on the roads, it is truly spotless. All institutions, shops, and residences are hung with the red-bottomed white-circled "卍" flag and the white-bottomed five-ring Games flag. The flags in front of the larger buildings are five or six zhang long and flutter in the wind, showing the spirit of the event and filling the entire city of Berlin with a warm and tense atmosphere.</p>
<p>The competition venue, the Olympic New Village, and the front of the women's dormitory are filled with spectators every day. Whenever foreigners from any country come out, whether you are an athlete, a staff member, or a journalist, many people will surround you, take photos of you, and ask you to sign autographs. This is also the case when walking on the street. Even many seven- or eight-year-old children are holding a commemorative booklet and a pencil, pulling people to sign autographs. Their innocent and naive look is truly lovely. The enthusiasm of the Germans for the Games can also be seen from this point.</p>
<p>On the 29th, the German boxer Max Schmaling visited the Olympic New Village. As soon as he entered the gate, he was surrounded by hundreds of boxing fans. All the cameras were focused on him. Since defeating the American "Black Bomber" Joe Louis, Schmaling has become a German national hero. When the news of his victory was transmitted from the United States to Germany, German leader Hitler and Minister of Propaganda Goebbels sent congratulatory telegrams. When he returned to Germany from the United States, he was even more warmly welcomed. The Berlin cinemas are showing the film of his match with Joe Louis, and it has not stopped until now. American aviator Colonel Lindbergh, who lives in London, has also come to Berlin to visit the Games. Like Schmaling, he has become a topic of conversation for the public.</p>
<p>All the arrangements for the Games have been completed and are just waiting for the official opening tomorrow afternoon. The order and organization of the Germans are truly admirable. We can describe them in eight words: "No one is idle, and nothing is unattended." Wherever we are, we will never see people wearing badges who are not doing anything. No matter what happens, we will never fail to find someone to take care of it. Therefore, although athletes, staff members, and journalists from various countries have come to a place where they are unfamiliar with the people and the environment, they do not feel any difficulties.</p>
<p>There are a total of 1,200 journalists from various countries who have come specifically for the Games. Among them, there are 72 from Japan, 27 of whom have been officially recognized. The Games has set up a news department to provide news to journalists from various countries. The news department has a large office, and each country has a table and a typewriter for sending out dispatches and writing articles. The table is decorated with the national flags of various countries, and the order is very good. The journalists' seating in the competition venue is located in the best part of the venue. In front of the seats, there is also a long table for placing typewriters, installing telephones, and post offices are also attached to the back. Everything possible that journalists need has been arranged perfectly. Many wireless broadcasting machines have been installed in each sports venue so that representatives from various countries can broadcast news to their own countries. There are more than 400 broadcasting machines in total, and there are more than 1,000 people working on them. From the Chinese side, the journalists are responsible for broadcasting for 20 minutes every day starting at 12:00 noon. Sports programs related to China can also be broadcasted at any time during the competition. The sophistication of the equipment is also impeccable. German Minister of Propaganda Dr. Goebbels hosted a reception for representatives and journalists from various countries in the hall of the German Zoo at 8:00 PM on the 30th. More than 1,000 people attended. It was truly a grand banquet. Those participating from the Chinese side included Chief Delegate Wang Zhengyan, Chief Secretary Shen Siliang, Chu Anping from the Central Daily News, and four journalists. Bands were set up at both ends of the hall, playing melodious tunes at any time. The journalists who participated, although dressed in evening gowns, still could not get rid of their original hippie smiles. Everyone, regardless of nationality or whether they could communicate in the same language, shook hands and talked when they met, filling the great hall with a harmonious and intimate atmosphere. The banquet was very simple, with one soup and two dishes, and snacks and ice cream, unlike the extreme extravagance of the Chinese. After taking their seats, German Central Government Secretary Funk delivered a speech, followed by a speech by World Games President Counlde Bailet Latour. As the banquet was coming to an end, Goebbels stood up in the silence of the entire hall to deliver a speech. The bright lights shone like daylight. Movie cameras and cameras were aimed at him and started working. Although we could not understand the original meaning of his speech, this 38-year-old young politician had a sincere and calm attitude and eloquent speech. The applause from the entire hall was deafening. It is no accident that he is one of Hitler's right-hand men, along with General Goering. Finally, Victor Boin, president of the International Sports Journalists Association, delivered a reply. Because every speech had to be translated into German, English, and French, it was already midnight when everyone walked out of the hall with smiles on their faces.</p>

<h3 id="e152">The Second Day of the Joint Annual Meeting of Seven Scientific Societies: Experts from Various Societies Have New Inventions. Chang-ying Zhang et al. Invented that Hamsters Can Reproduce in the Laboratory. De-jun Yu et al. Invented New Species and Varieties of Rosaceae Plants in China. Zhao-lun Zeng Used the Pirani Method to Determine Phosphorus and Bismuth in Organic Matter. <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Beiping) The Chinese Science Society, Zoological Society, Botanical Society, Physical Society, Chemical Society, Mathematical Society, and Geographical Society, seven scientific organizations, held sessions at Tsinghua and Yenching Universities this morning (18th) to read papers and present inventions, resulting in numerous discoveries. In the afternoon, each society held business meetings. The Chinese Science Society proposed an amendment to the current calendar. On the 20th, the seven scientific organizations will jointly discuss the matter again. Details from various fields are recorded as follows: The Zoological Society convened at 8 a.m. in the auditorium of the Tsinghua Biological Hall to read papers. Among the inventions was "Hamsters Raised in the Laboratory Can Reproduce," by Xian Wu and Chang-ying Zhang. The key points of the invention are as follows: In 1919, En-zeng Xie used hamsters in medical experiments to replace white mice. Since then, the use of hamsters in experiments has been frequently reported, but no one has been able to make them reproduce in the laboratory. The main reason why hamsters cannot reproduce in the laboratory is that the female hamsters have irregular periods. If ovarian extract is added to the diet of female hamsters daily, their periods can be regulated after one month. Detailed observations were made on the daily height, weight, and physical development of hamsters during their growth period.</p>
<p>New Botanical Inventions</p>
<p>The Botanical Society convened at 8 a.m. in the Tsinghua Chemistry Building to read papers. The new inventions are recorded as follows: (1) Jing-yue Zhang read a paper on "The Growth and Differentiation of Soybean Stems and Leaves under Different Light Intensities." The main points of the invention are as follows: (1) The lower the light intensity, the longer the internodes and the greater the growth rate. (2) When the light intensity decreases, the leaves (leaf blades and petioles) become smaller, and the growth gradually slows down. (3) When the light intensity decreases, the differentiation rate of the stem tip also decreases. (4) When the light is very weak, the stem elongates extremely quickly, but the plant dies soon after. (5) Plants moved from strong light to a dark room grow less in the dark room the more they are exposed to light beforehand. (6) If only the tip of the plant is covered with black paper, the stems and leaves continue to grow very quickly. (2) De-jun Yu and Xi-tao Cai read a paper on "Rosaceae Plants in China." As a result of their research, they discovered two new species and two new varieties of Chinese roses, recorded as follows: Bosa bella Rehdet wib var nudayu et tsai (new variety). This variety differs from the original species in that its flowers are smaller and have smooth receptacles and pedicels. It is distributed in Shaanxi and Henan. (2) Rosa kwangtungensis yu et tsai (new species). This species is common in Guangdong. Most botanists previously mistakenly identified it as R. multifloa tbunberg, but it differs from the latter in that it has pubescent styles and stipules that are not pectinate. Some considered it a close relative of R. souliana crepin, which is produced in southwestern China, but it differs from the latter in that it is entirely covered with gray pubescence and is distributed in Guangdong. (3) Rosa lioui yu et tsai (new species). This new species belongs to the Cinnamomeae tribe and is a close relative of Rlaxa rety and R. Beggeriana schernk. It differs from the two in that the curved thorns under its stipules are large and shiny, and its bracts are narrowly lanceolate or linear-lanceolate, and its pedicels and receptacles are tightly covered with short hairs. It is distributed in Xinjiang. (4) Rosa moyesii var pubscens yu et tsai (new variety). This variety differs from the original species in that it has spines as long as the leaflets, the bases of the spines are enlarged, and the rachis and the underside of the leaflets have dense short hairs. It is distributed in Xikang.</p>
<p>New Chemical Inventions</p>
<p>The Chemical Society convened at 8 a.m. in the Yenching Chemistry Building to read papers. The inventions are recorded in the following order: (1) Zhao-lun Zeng read a paper on "The Determination of Phosphorus, Bismuth, Silicon, and Boron in Organic Compounds Using the Pirani Method." The key points of the invention are as follows: The Pirani method is now the simplest method for determining organic sulfur and halogens. Previous researchers have also tried to use this method to determine other elements. The author has now subjected organic compounds containing phosphorus, bismuth, silicon, and boron to Pirani melting (using sodium peroxide), then dissolved them in water, and applied the methods used in ordinary inorganic analysis to determine these elements. As a result, except for the analysis of boron, which was relatively poor, the rest can be considered satisfactory. (2) Yun-pu Liu read a paper on "A Variant of the Rast Micro-determination Method for Molecular Weight." The key points of the invention are as follows: To improve the usability and accuracy, the variant of the Rast micro-determination method for molecular weight was modified again. A melting point determination bulb was used instead of a melting point measurement tube. The test results obtained were satisfactory. The percentage difference of the molecular weight determined for each of the twenty different items was smaller than that of all previous researchers.</p>
<p>New Geographical Inventions</p>
<p>The Geographical Society convened at 8 a.m. in the Tsinghua Science Lecture Hall to read papers. Fu-ti Yuan read a paper on "The Lower and Middle Mesozoic Strata in Xinjiang." He discovered the lower Mesozoic strata in Shuixi Valley, Fuyuan County, and discovered fish fossils in the Triassic strata near Dihua. The newly discovered points are recorded as follows: In May of the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, when I (Yuan) was investigating the geology of Xinjiang, I discovered the lower Mesozoic strata in Shuixi Valley, Fuyuan County, and learned that its coal and iron were all in sedimentary rocks, mostly Jurassic. However, I discovered several more rock layers below it, so I continued to pursue them. In September of the same year, I discovered fossils of therapsid reptiles in the Triassic strata. In the eighteenth and nineteenth years, I continued to excavate in Fuyuan, Fukang, and Qitai counties. In the twentieth year, I discovered fish fossils in the Triassic strata near Dihua. I discovered seven locations rich in reptile fossils in the northern Tianshan Mountains and collected nearly seventy specimens in total. The work period extended to the summer of the twentieth year, but all the time was spent on preliminary collection work. All of my collected items were transported to Beiping with me in May of the eleventh year. Mr. Zhong-jian Yang gladly accepted to identify the reptile fossils. In the twenty-third year, the paleobotanist Mr. Xing-jian Si and Mr. Jun-ding Ge identified plant fossils and Triassic fish fossils, respectively. Therefore, my geological work in the northern Tianshan Mountains, according to the geological age indicated by the fossils, was able to be determined in detail. Repairing the fossils also took a lot of time. In the past three years, under the supervision of Mr. Yang, eight reptile fossils have been repaired, belonging to three orders, five genera, six classes, and two different periods. If environmental conditions permit, I will continue to sort out the remaining sixty specimens, and there may be new materials discovered.</p>
<p>Ultra-High Frequency Radio Waves</p>
<p>From 4 to 5 p.m., the joint annual meeting held a public lecture in the Tsinghua Science Museum. Zhi-gong Ren spoke on "The Effects of Ultra-High Frequency Radio Waves on Living Organisms," briefly stating that we have long known that R-rays, X-rays, and ultraviolet rays, which belong to electromagnetic waves, have special effects on living organisms. High-frequency radio waves are also a band of the electromagnetic spectrum and have even more significant effects on living organisms, especially ultra-high frequencies. This type of ultra-high frequency wave can be generated by a vacuum tube oscillator. The capacitor of the oscillator has a high-frequency electric field, and its coil has a high magnetic field. If we place a living organism in a high-frequency electric or magnetic field, the most noticeable phenomenon is the rapid increase in the organism's temperature, the speed of which depends on the strength of the field, the type and size of the organism, and its health condition. We have experimented with a variety of organisms. Warm-blooded animals include white mice, guinea pigs, rabbits, cats, dogs, sparrows, and pigeons. Cold-blooded animals include frogs, tadpoles, toads, fish, bees, and fruit flies. If they are subjected to a high-frequency electric field, they will die after a considerable period of time (ranging from one to eighty minutes). However, if they are subjected to a high-frequency magnetic field, warm-blooded animals die in much the same way, while cold-blooded animals show no significant effects after several hours. According to the results of our autopsies on dead organisms, all organisms that die from high-frequency field forces die from increased heat. Other effects may also exist simultaneously, but because the heating effect is so great, it overshadows everything, and we cannot easily detect them for the time being. We have tried to adopt Debye's theory for electrolytes and liquids. Debye believed that the conductivity of electrolytes or polar liquids must change depending on the frequency. As the frequency increases from low to high, the conductivity also increases, until it increases particularly at ultra-high frequencies. As a result, the ability to absorb electrical energy is also particularly great. The effect of ultra-high frequency waves to heat the inside of living organisms has now been practically applied to the treatment of many diseases and is a very useful new development for medicine.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the market situation of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange turned down rather sharply. The situation in Guangxi became worse, and Suidong also gradually became tight. In the late session, there was a saying that Guangxi was organizing a government, and the financial community tended to sell. Although the swap transaction was very lively, the long and short sides were still balanced, and there was no one-sided squeeze. As the delivery approached, if there were wars, the market price would easily fall. The people in the market were firm, and the long positions were more than the short positions.

<p>In the morning session of listed yarn, the market for American cotton three-grade yarn fell, and the momentum became weaker and weaker.

<p>The cotton market first declined and then rebounded, but the market state remains weak. This is because the overseas cotton industry situation is sluggish, the domestic climate is suitable, and new cotton production from all regions is sound and the harvest is greatly increased. Therefore, most psychological tendencies are towards selling. In the afternoon, private telegrams circulated in the market stating that there were bullish news for American cotton, which boosted morale and caused a rebound.</p>
<p>Bid-offer Cotton First Falls then Recovers</p>
<p>In the morning session, the opening of bid-offer cotton saw American Southern cotton being sold short, with a sharp drop of 11 to 17 points. Indian cotton also fell by 0.75 to 2 rupees 25. Osaka's Three Goods cotton plummeted by 8.9 jiao. Market sentiment was extremely bearish. Coupled with sunny weather and lush growth in various cotton regions, it was believed that Yao cotton would soon be available in large quantities. Therefore, short sellers were active, and new cotton fell sharply by 3.4 jiao in the near month and 2.5 jiao in the distant month. After the second session, Gengfeng, Xincheng, and Yuanyi made up for losses during the decline. However, Changhe and Dafu continued to sell and added positions, gradually rebounding. As a result, each month's closing price was down by 1 jiao to 2.5 jiao compared to the previous day. In the afternoon session, the market spread private telegrams stating that American Southern cotton harvests were damaged by 500,000 bales, which was bullish for market prices, triggering a buying spree and tightening the market situation. As a result, each month's closing price rebounded by 5 fen to 2 jiao compared to the morning closing price, with August falling by 3.5 jiao.

<p>Yesterday, the opening of American cotton received unfavorable news from Liverpool. Liverpool, Bombay, New Orleans, and local agents were said to be selling. At the same time, buyers were wary of the uncertain foreign political situation and feared increased short-selling, leading to a decline of 4 to 6 points in each month. Subsequently, fellow traders bought in, and the southwestern part continued to be dry, with the quality of Texas and Oklahoma cotton deteriorating. The market situation rebounded firmly, but demand was not high and there was little short-selling. Spot demand increased with quiet inquiries, and the closing was flat and weak. It is estimated that spot prices fell by 12 points and futures fell by 12 to 17 points. English spot cotton fell by 1 point and futures fell by 6 to 7 points. Indian cotton was initially weak due to multiple sellers, but later rebounded as European exporters bought in and short-sellers cross-bought due to continued drought in Gogera and Gorakhpur. It is estimated that Pingguo'er fell by 0.75 rupee, Aomula fell by 2.25 rupees, and Bai Luoxi fell by 0.75 to 1.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left. (Telegram dated the 18th)</p>

<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market situation was such that the yarn and cloth were particularly affected due to predictions of abundant raw cotton production from various regions, and the sentiment was greatly weakened. However, at present, because spot sales are brisk and new deliveries from various regions continue to increase, goods such as printed flannel, white flannel, coarse cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill are selling well. Shenxin's 11-pound Ren Zhong Siping Lian coarse cloth is in short supply at the factory, and the price has increased by 5 fen per piece. Among bleached cloths, high-end cloths are the most sluggish. Although prices have been reduced by 2 to 3 jiao, sales remain sluggish, and the most inventory is stored in the market. The prices of Eastern fine cloth, fine twill, and market cloth are generally unchanged, with occasional declines of around 2.5 fen. The sales prices of our factory's fine cloth and fine twill have not changed, and the sales of scattered spot goods are still quite good. However, due to the decline in raw cotton prices, futures traders are wary and dare not invest. Customers still consider the trends in the northern routes of Tianjin, Yantai, Sichuan, and the Yangtze River basin to be better. The Henan route is quiet due to a prolonged drought and damage to agricultural production.</p>

American firms' silk deliveries were unanimously holding back and watching because the purchase procedures in Shanghai were not perfect. Therefore, only firms such as Bilibeiya slightly negotiated yesterday.</p>

Up to now, 52,435 boxes of Qi tea, 9,259 boxes of Ning tea, 16,696 boxes of Qi floral tea, and 5,160 boxes of Ning floral tea have been sold. A total of 83,550 boxes have been sold, with a total of 80,649 boxes of Qi tea including floral tea and 15,466 boxes of Ning tea including floral tea arriving. Excluding sales, there are still 11,518 boxes of Qi tea and floral tea and 1,047 boxes of Ning tea and floral tea remaining.</p>
<p>According to a report from the Tea Merchants Association, the green tea market has remained quiet in recent days, with very few transactions. Telegrams from overseas offer progressively tighter prices, so that yesterday, although Xiehe Huacha intended to buy Zhenmei, the price could not be agreed upon after several rounds of negotiation, and the transaction could not be completed. Xiehe only bought dozens of pieces of Zhenmei at a price of 68 yuan. Baitouhang still had transactions for low-grade Guixi at a price of over 20 yuan. Daba Huacha Jinlong in Pingshui tea had some intentions and were reportedly negotiating prices. The transaction of another packaged pearl tea was also clear.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Sugar Market: Four Hundred Tons of Raw Dutch White Sugar Offered <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market transactions were flat. The association's benchmark price for 24th-grade raw sugar remained at 21.85 yuan, and transit goods were 6.8 yuan, but no transactions were made. The prices of Dongbai No. 4 and No. 8 were the same as before, with no transactions. However, there were slight transactions for No. 9 YKO mark at 21 yuan and transit goods TM yuan at 6.125 yuan. The price of our factory's cotton white sugar also remained unchanged. On the brokerage side, Dachanghao offered 400 tons of Dutch raw sugar, with the price for the September-October shipment at 2.89 Dutch currency. Chao Gang offered over 30 packages of cotton red sugar at 14.8 yuan. The market situation was flat.</p>
<p>The sugar industry joint venture company held its second bid-offer futures for this week yesterday, with a total of 8,159 packages, including 4,695 packages from the Shunde factory at 21.6 yuan, with 670 packages traded; 2,100 packages from the Shixin factory at 21.4 yuan, with 310 packages traded; 920 packages from Shantou at 20.09 yuan, with 210 packages traded; and 410 packages of Shixin medium coarse sugar at 19.3 yuan, with packages traded. A total of 1,240 packages were traded.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Special Article: A Comparison of Silk Production and Sales in China and Japan in the Last Ten Years <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>—He Yan</p>
<p>Silk is one of China's important agricultural products, and its prosperity or decline has a huge impact on the domestic rural economy and urban prosperity. However, because China, which has a history of more than 2,000 years of sericulture and silk production, has seen technological and economic improvements in silk-producing countries such as Japan and Italy in modern times, and the government authorities have provided effective assistance, the production and sales of their silk have been making great strides. Japanese raw silk has even grasped the hegemony of manipulating raw silk trade in the world market, and it is almost possible to monopolize it. (Japanese silk accounts for about 98% of all silk imported by the United States, which accounts for 70% of the world's total raw silk consumption.) Looking back at China, in recent years, the silk industry has been working hard to improve products, and there is no shortage of people, but those that have been implemented and have achieved results are still in the budding and promotion stages. As for those who only care about temporary and personal interests, and cause Chinese silk to lose its reputation abroad, there are many people. (This point refers to Chinese speculative silk merchants and irregular export foreign merchants, such as those who buy inferior silk products, change silk labels, and abuse the upgrade to sell to foreign countries at high prices.) Both of these combined, the situation of their panting under the threat of Japanese silk is exactly the same, and the fact that they still cannot have rapid and reasonable improvement is also the same. Here is a table of the raw silk production of China, Japan, and Italy in the past eleven years to see how the raw silk of each country is affected by its environment (political, economic, scientific) differently, and how it affects its production.</p>
<p>Raw Silk Production in Various Countries in the Past Eleven Years (Unit: 1,000 pounds)</p>
<p>(The statistics in this table are based on the figures published by the National Textile Manufacturers Association of America)</p>
<p>Judging from the numbers in the above table, the average annual output of Japanese silk accounts for 75% of the world's total output. From 1923 to 1930, China's raw silk production showed a gradual increase every year. However, since 1931, it has suddenly decreased. Although there was a slight increase again in 1933, it declined again in 1934. (It is estimated that in 1931, it decreased by 1,577,000 pounds compared with the previous year, and in 1932, it dropped sharply to only 9,023,000 pounds. Although it increased to 10,820,000 pounds in 1933, it only produced 8,805,000 pounds in the following year, only four-tenths of the production in 1929.) The astonishing sharp decline, compared with the annual increase in Japanese silk production, is even more inferior. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e169">Food: Factories Dump Violently, Flour Reverses and Plummets <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market showed a trend of first stabilizing and then plummeting in all months after the opening in the morning. The quoted price of foreign wheat was slightly better by 12 jiao in Chicago and about 4 fen better in Canada. When the price was opened, this month's price initially weakened and then recovered because both long and short positions wanted to close. The price for September also initially rose by 1 fen, but later, as the rumor of increased taxes in Yingkou became prevalent, the factories dumped heavily, and it immediately loosened by 1 fen. The prices below were all unstable due to the factories' sales. After the second session, this month's price was still stable with weakness due to both parties closing positions. In September and below, some bulls also sold off, and the factories' aggressive dumping made people feel very empty, and the decline was quite violent. Because of the continuous high rise in recent days, the factories had been standing aside, but now that they have purchased and stockpiled a considerable amount of wheat, they are rushing to sell. The so-called high rise must be dangerous, and it seems to be a necessary reversal. As a result of the closing, this month's price only fell by 1 fen, and all months after September fell by a huge 34 fen. If there are no special changes in the future, it should be a fixed situation. As for the spot flour market, it still needed to be increased in price a few days ago. Recently, because there are only a few days left in this month, major factories still need to raise funds, so it can already be drawn at the same price.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Wheat Futures Followed the Decline by 67 Fen <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market showed a state of initially being flat and then plummeting after the opening in the morning. When the price was opened, people were already mainly stable because the quoted price of foreign wheat was still slightly rising, so the opening price was similar to the previous day. As it approached the second session and below, some bulls tended to sell off because the decline in the flour market was very strong, and the opening price was immediately lower. Originally, the market sentiment had no fixed purpose. If there were more buyers, they would follow in, and vice versa, they would compete to sell, and it often did not match the actual distance. The opening price for this month was 5.08 yuan, and the closing price was only 1 fen, with a difference of 7 fen. The others also reached 67 fen each. The market has already reached such a high level. If the flour sales become sluggish, a reversal must be prevented. Spot wheat market, due to the sharp decline in standards and the suspension of factory purchases, all brokers shouted Xiao Wu Fen to open Baluling Linhuai Pass at 5.05 yuan, then to 0.03 yuan, Bengbu wheat at 5.01 yuan, then 4.99 yuan, Zhuzhen wheat at 5.01 yuan, Gaoyou wheat at 4.97 yuan, then 9.5 jiao, Dongtai Daqiao wheat at 4.95 yuan, Shaoxing wheat at 4.79 yuan. Fuxin bought 4,000 packages.</p>
<h3 id="e171">White Japonica and Thin Rice Sales Are Both Dull <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, a total of 17 or 18 shipments arrived from various gangs, totaling 3,400 or 500 stones, most of which were thin rice. Therefore, although 6700 packages were handled by the Dalian Qingdao Qinhuangdao gangs in the thin rice market, the result was still a reduction of 12 jiao or more. The price of thick early japonica rice depreciated by a few fen due to the sluggish sales in this street market. Du Yangjian was in short supply and the price was stable. Yinyuan rice was similar. A total of more than 1,500 stones arrived in Dongxin, and the route was flat, falling by 2 chi.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 356 boats arrived from various routes in Hexia. The various types of white japonica Yang Dufu Kejian were very dull in the market. The sales of thin rice Bianyuan and Lianhao were slightly better. The market price of high-quality white japonica was barely stable, while the medium and inferior ones were about 1 jiao lower. The price of Bianyuan thin rice fell by about 1 jiao. The various indica rices were weak by a few fen. The supply of Dongxin was quite abundant, but the sales were sluggish, and the price was slightly lower by 2 jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Rough Indica Rice Sells Well and Rises Sharply <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's market situation for customer indica rice was such that arrivals and sales were both strong, and the market atmosphere remained active. However, after the various stalls of machine-milled white rice had jumped in price the day before yesterday, the customers this time were not as greedy as they were a few days ago. The price of rough rice, on the other hand, had fallen sharply by 23 jiao previously, and the degree of decline was too high, which in turn triggered the customers to continue to buy. Therefore, the machine-milled rice has temporarily stabilized, while the rough rice has risen sharply by more than 1.5 jiao. The main route is still this street, and the Ningbo gang, Shantou, Xiamen, inland, and northern ports are all embellishments. 3,500 packages of Hankou goods, 2,480 packages of Jiangxi rice, 100 packages of Hunan rice, and 290 packages of Taiwan rice were offered for rough rice.</p>
<h3 id="e173">The Rising Trend of New Sesame Seeds Has Subsided, and New Soybeans Have No Ups and Downs for the Time Being <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>The rising trend of new sesame seeds from foreign firms has temporarily subsided. Because foreign merchants are hindered by the continuously rising prices and do not intend to buy, the market atmosphere has been flattened. Yesterday, only Jardine Matheson dumped 200 tons at a price of 12.8 yuan, with delivery scheduled for October and November. The future trend mainly depends on the thickness of the route. The new soybeans are hovering, and the high-quality goods are tight, due to the consecutive purchases by oil mills and the inquiries from the Fuzhou gang. Therefore, the overall situation has no ups and downs for the time being. It is estimated that more than 50 packages of various new beans were opened yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Seafood: New Crop of Grade 10 Sea Cucumber and Dried Scallops are Scarce, So Market Prices are Exceptionally Firm <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>The new crop of Grade 10 sea cucumber is scarce this year, and the source is very rare. Therefore, the market price has peaked, and there is often a shortage of goods to supply the market. Yesterday, brokerage firms offered 14 boxes of new Jiang Co sea cucumber, estimated at 38 pieces at 298 yuan, 45 pieces at 282 yuan, 50 pieces at 277 yuan, 60 pieces at 261.5 yuan, and 75 pieces at 244 yuan. The brokers' appetite for importing is strong, and the goods are cleared as they arrive. The market situation is exceptionally firm.</p>
<p>According to news from the producing area of dried scallops, the production of new goods is not high. The cost of shipping to Shanghai based on the local price is estimated to be more than 170 yuan. Therefore, the selling price of the old goods stored in this city's streets is tightening. The current selling price of brokers is quoted at 167 yuan for medium-sized Qiushui goods. The market is expected to rise further.</p>

<p>The arrival of Hainan longan has increased slightly this time. Because sales are gradually becoming flat, sentiment is softening. Yesterday, it was heard that the various stores in the north-south market opened a total of one hundred and dozens of pieces, a decrease of 12 yuan compared to before. If more goods arrive in the next batch, the opening price may continue to loosen, because Guangzhou longan has also dropped significantly.</p>

<h3 id="e189">Li Yuexun <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Zhen</p>
<p>When the law loses its function, virtuous men are compelled to take matters into their own hands, acting on the principle of "drawing their swords when injustice is seen on the road."</p>
<p>During the Qianlong era of the Qing dynasty, there was a poor scholar in Zhangnan named Li Yuexun. From a young age, he was known for his moral character and diligence in learning, earning the respect of the entire village. At that time, the eight-legged essay was the only path for scholars. Yuexun became a Xiucai (a degree in the imperial examination system) at the age of sixteen, and he happily thought, "The villagers value me so much, I must do great things for them. I passed the Xiucai exam at such a young age, if I continue to work hard, passing the Juren and Jinshi exams will not be difficult. Once the path of the imperial examination is open, I can become a high-ranking official and do public good for the village!" Who knew that after reading the eight-legged essay for two more years and gaining a deeper understanding of worldly affairs, doubts arose in his heart. He often asked himself, "If I want to do something truly practical for the people, I should seek practical knowledge. If I want to reform society, I should understand society; if I want to understand society, I should read more history. Zizhuang often has water troubles, if I want to relieve the suffering of the villagers, I should study water conservancy. Other things like studying military affairs, promoting agriculture, studying engineering, studying commerce, etc., are all practical knowledge, but the eight-legged essay completely ignores these. If I only focus on the eight-legged essay today, even if I am lucky enough to become famous and a high-ranking official in the future, what will I rely on to govern the world and benefit the people?..."</p>
<p>He thought about abandoning the eight-legged essay, hesitated for a long time, unable to make a decision. He still followed the routine of reading the eight-legged essay and taking the exams. One day, his wife fell ill from hunger. He was very anxious and wanted to borrow a liter of beans to cook porridge for her, but he ran into obstacles everywhere all day long, returning empty-handed at dusk. He felt ashamed and lingered outside the door, not daring to go inside to see his wife. But he was afraid that she would really starve to death, so he became anxious again. With his hands behind his back, he knelt and peered through the crack in the door. It was already time to light the lamps, but the room was pitch black, and he couldn't see anything. Just as he was racking his brains for a solution, someone unexpectedly and quietly placed a pile of things in his hand. When he turned around to look, he only saw a small shadow dart into the house next door on the left. In the dim twilight, he could still clearly see that what he held in his hands were five white cakes. Remembering many similar experiences in the past, he immediately knew what was going on this time. It turned out that there was a child selling cakes next door who felt sorry for him not having food and often reheated leftover cakes and sent them to him. This child was very clever, he knew that scholars valued their reputation the most, so he always quietly delivered the cakes, dropping them off and running away. Yuexun would not accept them unless he was really starving. Often, the child would quietly send the cakes, and Yuexun would ask his wife to quietly send them back. This time, in order to save his wife who was about to starve to death, he couldn't insist on that anymore. He felt as if he had received a million gold, happily holding the cakes and pushing the door open. He relied on those few cakes to save his wife's life.</p>
<p>When his wife recovered her strength, she said to Yuexun, "Look, even a child who sells cakes can support a family and help others. You are a man who stands tall and firm, but you have only read a few dead books, unable to handle light or heavy tasks, and you can't even support yourself. I think the eight-legged essay is harmful, let's not study it anymore. It is more proper to honestly farm the land or do business. Although it is said that passing the imperial examination can lead to becoming an official, didn't you say that you don't want to become an official, but want to save people? If you can't save yourself, how can you save others? I don't believe that a person is useless before passing the examination, and becomes capable after passing it. Don't deceive yourself! You should open your eyes and see what the current dignitaries are like. Aren't they all from the imperial examination? What have they actually done? This is not the way, you should give up."</p>
<p>After hearing his wife's words, Yuexun decided to give up the eight-legged essay and farm the land to support his family. In his spare time, he read more practical books, and his knowledge improved day by day. But unfortunately, the country had established the system of selecting officials through the imperial examination, and Yuexun lacked this stepping stone of the eight-legged essay, so he was never recognized for his talent in his life. The method of selecting scholars was flawed, and the appointment of people was inappropriate, causing the common people to suffer countless losses. Although the country had laws to protect the public, "the heavens are high and the emperor is far away," and the oppressed common people, unable to see the light of day due to the power of the authorities, had no way to appeal. Yuexun was a benevolent person full of love for the world, and he couldn't bear to see injustice. He often drew his sword when he saw injustice on the road, doing many good deeds of eliminating evil and helping the good in the village, so everyone called him Li the Swordsman. He often sighed to people, "The gentlemen of ancient times were deeply concerned about the people, so they aspired to be good doctors even if they couldn't be good ministers. Today, I can't bear to see people suffer losses, unable to enforce the law, so I can only act as a knight-errant. Alas, how could this be my original intention—I want to save the people of the world from deep water and scorching fire. When I hear someone crying from hunger and cold, I feel it is my responsibility, but what can a knight-errant accomplish? Those who don't know me may think that I enjoy being a knight-errant, but in fact, this is my inevitable and unavoidable behavior!"</p>
<p>The people of Zizhuang knew that Yuexun could protect the weak and seek justice for the wronged, so whoever suffered injustice would go to Yuexun. Yuexun often wore short clothes and trousers, carrying two knives when he traveled, his imposing manner intimidating, causing even the bullies to lose their courage. Yuexun did many remarkable things in the village, but his rescue of a certain widow was the most touching.</p>
<p>There was a young and beautiful widow in Zizhuang, living with her fourteen-year-old son and refusing to remarry. Her younger brother-in-law, greedy for the money of Hou Liu from Nei Huang, secretly sold his sister-in-law to him. When the wedding sedan came to pick her up, the younger brother-in-law ordered the people to hide in the nearby ancient temple first, and then he went home to trick his sister-in-law out under a pretext. As soon as she came out, the dozens of people hiding in the temple also ran out. She didn't know what was going on, and was shocked. She turned around to go home, but the gate was already tightly closed. With nowhere to go, the wedding party seized the opportunity to grab her, forcibly put her in the sedan, and escorted her away. Her son heard the unfortunate news and rushed to rescue her, but it was too late. He knew that he couldn't win against the crowd, and chasing after them would only be a futile death. He wouldn't be able to get her back. So he ran to find Yuexun, running before Yuexun and crying for help. Yuexun frowned and said, "This matter is not easy to handle! That Hou Liu is a brave warrior, and your mother is already in his hands. The journey is far, I'm afraid we won't be able to get her back in time." The widow's son, hearing Yuexun's words, knelt down desperately, refusing to get up, and cried even more bitterly. Yuexun couldn't bear it, so he agreed generously, "Rescuing your mother is indeed my responsibility, I will go immediately. If I can't get your mother back, I will not return alive." After Yuexun finished speaking, he came out and gathered his followers, saying, "In the village, I have always been known for my chivalry. Today, someone has robbed a woman in our village, and if I can't save her, what kind of chivalry am I? I originally wanted to file a lawsuit for her, but the officials these days are all bastards, they only know how to be greedy and accept bribes, how can they handle anything? Moreover, the documents have to go through the province and the checkpoints, it will take several months to move, how can we make it in time? That Hou Liu, seeing that we are pressing him urgently, will immediately get married. If the woman is married to him, what's the point of asking her to come back? Then, even if the lawsuit is won, it will be like a loss, what's the use? I think it's better to use force to rob Hou Liu alive. Even if we can't get the woman, capturing Hou Liu can still protect her." Everyone listened to Yuexun's words and agreed. Yuexun then selected twenty-seven people to go with him.</p>
<p>Hou Liu lived in Gangu, twenty li away from Zizhuang. Yuexun led his men and arrived there late at night. Finding Hou Liu's house, he directed his followers to push open the door and go straight into the hall. At that time, the guests were all seated, and everyone was unguarded, drinking happily. Suddenly seeing Yuexun and his men rushing in with swords, everyone was shocked. They wanted to besiege Yuexun and others, but they were unarmed and didn't know what to do. Yuexun opened his eyes wide and shouted loudly, scaring them all back. They trampled on each other, extremely embarrassed, and had no other way. Yuexun seized the opportunity to run into the bride's room to find the woman. At that time, Hou Liu had already hidden the woman in the straw hut and was looking for people to help him resist Yuexun. Unexpectedly, before he was ready, Yuexun had already arrived. Yuexun tightly grabbed Hou Liu's wrist with his left hand, pulled out the knife at his waist to threaten him, and loudly rebuked, "Haven't you heard of Li Yuexun in Zizhuang? How dare you come to my village to rob a woman? Where is the woman now? Hand her over quickly, or I will kill you." Hou Liu answered in a trembling voice, "I, I, I have already released her." Yuexun knew that Hou Liu was lying to him, and angrily ordered his men to tie Hou Liu's hands behind his back. As soon as they were tied up, the young people in the village, not knowing the details, heard that there were violent intruders in the Hou family, and rushed to attack Yuexun with weapons. Seeing the menacing momentum, Yuexun knew that he could only win by relying on both wisdom and courage, so he ordered his twenty-seven men to stand guard with their weapons facing outward, while he stood in the middle, holding his knife against Hou Liu's neck, and said to the crowd in a stern voice, "Yuexun has come this time with no intention of returning alive. Those who dare to fight me, come on!" As he spoke, he raised his knife and tested it on Hou Liu's neck, implying, "If you make any move, I will kill him first." The crowd, seeing this terrifying scene, were all sweating with fear, standing far away, not daring to approach. Yuexun asked Hou Liu again, "Where is the woman?" Hou Liu refused to tell the truth, Yuexun was angry, and dragged Hou Liu out. Before he reached the door, he heard the woman's crying. Yuexun and others followed the sound and found her in the straw hut. So Yuexun ordered the twenty-seven men to protect her and walk ahead, while he drove Hou Liu behind him with his knife. The people of Gangu were afraid of Yuexun, and no one dared to chase after him. Seeing that he had completely won, Yuexun didn't want to overuse his power. He released Hou Liu halfway and said to him, "Li Yuexun of Zizhuang is not afraid of death. If you want revenge, I will be waiting for you at home tomorrow." Hou Liu mumbled and dared not say anything. As soon as he was free, he fled as if escaping from the tiger's mouth.</p>
<p>Late at night, Yuexun returned to Zizhuang, handed the widow over to her son, and then dismissed his men. When the widow's son went to ask Yuexun for help, her younger brother-in-law, fearing Yuexun's reprimand, had already fled. Hou Liu, having learned his lesson, was also afraid and dared not come to feud with Yuexun again. From then on, as long as Yuexun was in Zizhuang, there was peace and tranquility.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744-1829) <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Bao</p>
<p>—A Courageous Naturalist—</p>
<p>Lamarck was born in 1744 in the countryside of Bazentin, Picardy, France. He came from a poor family, his father was a soldier. Lamarck had eleven siblings, he himself was the youngest. Many people in his family joined the army, his three elder brothers were soldiers, and the eldest brother had bravely died in battle during a siege. When Lamarck was very young, he would say to his father, "Elder brother died for the country, how glorious! I want to emulate him, Dad, he will take me with him, won't he?" His father's eyes turned red, unable to speak. But in his heart, he decided that Lamarck should study to be a monk. Soon, he sent him to school in Amiens to study. He reluctantly studied there for a few years, often imagining the heroic life of a soldier when no one was watching, and always wanting to join the army. He repeatedly wrote letters requesting his father, but each time he received a firm rejection. At the age of sixteen, he received the news of his father's death, and immediately left school to rush home for the funeral. The passion of loving his parents and the terror of death made him feel that life was short and he should make an effort in time, preparing for a glorious death. It further strengthened his determination to join the army.</p>
<p>At that time, the Besujolais regiment was fighting in Vestphaha. Lamarck managed to get a letter of introduction and ran there to join the army. The captain saw that he was a child and didn't take him seriously. But out of courtesy, he had to accept him. He could only let him join the ranks. Then, due to the urgency of the war, he no longer paid attention to this little soldier. After a fierce battle at night, many people were killed and wounded on both sides. The next day, everyone transferred troops from the rear to replenish the ranks, and prepared for a big battle. Just after dawn, the captain ran to the front line to command, transferring the soldiers who fought bravely last night to the rear. He suddenly noticed Lamarck and asked in surprise, "Kid, how come you are here too?"</p>
<p>It turned out that last night the captain had handed him over to a platoon leader. The platoon leader was unhappy to have such a small soldier and secretly said to the captain, "Why recruit a child? If you love him, treat him like a treasure, why assign him to my name?" He suddenly had malicious intent out of hatred and said, "Okay, let's just kill him quickly. How much courage does he have? Send him to the front line, without personally engaging in battle, I think he will be scared to death." The platoon leader immediately sent him to the front line where the fighting was taking place. Unexpectedly, he wasn't afraid at all, fighting bravely in the hail of bullets all night. The next day, he still stood bravely on the front line, refusing to retreat. When the captain asked him, he didn't really answer the captain's questions, but insisted on serving on the front line. He finally said to the captain with tears in his eyes, "I come from a military family and have received military training since I was a child. Captain, please believe me, just let me serve on the front line! I can't let my elder brother have all the glory, Captain, you know how gloriously he died!" Just then, the enemy came to challenge again, and the camp sounded the emergency assembly call, preparing for battle. The captain didn't have time to say much, silently agreeing and running to the front line to command. Lamarck assumed that the captain had tacitly approved him, and immediately followed the bugle call to assemble, going to the front line to resist the enemy. This time, France was defeated, almost all the officers were killed in battle, and the soldiers were very panicked, disregarding discipline and scrambling to retreat. Only Lamarck's small team, seeing him fighting bravely, all stayed on the front line and fought desperately against the enemy. Finally, they received the order from the regimental commander, and they guarded the order, covering each other while retreating to the defense line. The captain saw that Lamarck was so loyal and brave, and immediately formally reused him. The war soon ended, and the regiment went to Monaco to be stationed. One day, a newly arrived officer heard people talking about Lamarck's brave and courageous deeds, and was so excited that he lifted Lamarck up by the head. Unexpectedly, he injured his neck, developing a terrible cervical adenitis, forcing him to return to Paris for treatment.</p>
<p>After recovering from his illness, he changed his career to study medicine. But because he was too poor, he had to spend most of his time earning a living. At the same time, he liked to go to the Royal Garden to study plants, reading all the books there about plants. As a result, his progress in medicine was not as good as his botany. Later, he became fond of mathematics and wanted to change his career again, but his brothers advised him to continue studying medicine, which made him even more confused. Fortunately, he met the great French philosopher Rousseau there. Rousseau took him around to collect plants. Influenced by Rousseau, he decided to give up medicine and specialize in botany. His brothers opposed him, but he didn't care. After returning from his travels, he chose botany as a subject under the famous botanist Bernard de Jussieu and studied it carefully.</p>
<p>During his studies, he lived a very hard life. Some wealthy relatives felt sorry for him and often came to persuade him, "Lamarck, with your intelligence, it would be easy to develop in the military, political, or even business world, and gain both fame and fortune. Why suffer like this? It's not easy to become a naturalist. You have been working hard for several years, exhausting yourself, and still haven't achieved any results. This proves that you cannot become a naturalist. Actually, what's so great about being a naturalist? You might as well give up and change your career with me. I can immediately find you a good job."</p>
<p>Lamarck, who was making progress in his research, became angry when he heard such disheartening words and sternly refused, "Thank you for your kindness, but unfortunately, this is not something you can understand. I believe that the most interesting subject in the world is natural history, and the most valuable people are naturalists. I also believe that if I work hard, I will definitely succeed in becoming a naturalist. However, great talents mature late, and the more valuable something is, the higher the price it requires. So I want to devote all my time and energy to pursuing my knowledge. I am even willing to sacrifice my life for it. What does suffering mean?" Seeing him studying so diligently, people stopped bothering him.</p>
<p>At the age of thirty-four, his book Flora Francocie was published, and soon became popular, making him famous. The following year, he was appreciated by the French king and selected as a member of the Academy of Sciences. Later, he was appointed as the administrator of the Royal "Collection of Plants". Although he received high honors, his income was very meager, and he had to support five children. As a result, he still had to live a hard life. Fortunately, he had a spirit of enduring hardship, able to withstand all difficulties, and constantly striving for further study. In 1793, the Paris Museum of Natural History, which Lamarck advocated and founded, was established. Lamarck served as the administrator of the neglected Invertebrate Department, and independently engaged in research. He invented the terms "Vertebrates" and "Invertebrates", which are still in use today. The invertebrates studied by Lamarck had mostly not been discussed by predecessors, and were complex and chaotic. Lamarck spent eight years of effort to sort them out and publish his masterpiece Système des Animaux sans Vertèbres (System of Animals without Vertebrae). Because of his efforts and research achievements, year after year were amazing. In his old age, he gained extremely high prestige, succeeding Linnaeus as the world's great naturalist.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Unified Sales Method for Magazines and Books, and Other Matters <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Zhongxian</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Education promulgated the "Unified Sales Method for Textbooks and Other Books" on April 7th of this year, it seems to have had some impact on the publishing industry. In the 58th issue of this publication, Mr. Duxiu (Chen Duxiu) specially wrote an article as a letter of good news, believing that "this is an unprecedented transformation in the publishing industry" and "the prelude to the great flowering of the entire Chinese cultural world." Indeed, this is a perfect and thorough method! On June 2nd, the Shanghai Booksellers' Association, which holds the key to the national publishing industry, re-established a 15-chapter, 64-article implementation method based on the ministry's outline. Shortly thereafter, the New Life Bookstore and Kaiming Bookstore followed by reducing prices and publishing book catalogs. Such a surge made me secretly happy, thinking that there was great hope for the future. However, upon turning to the June 30th announcement of the Booksellers' Association, unfortunately, this 15-chapter grand plan was postponed for six months due to "cumbersome procedures" and "insufficient preparation." Although the outline issued by the Ministry of Education remains the law and still exists.</p>
<p>However, we must not ignore the outline issued by the Ministry and the methods formulated by the Association simply because the Ministry's methods have had little response or because of the six-month postponement. Moreover, this is indeed a major reform in the publishing industry! Therefore, I am eager to take this opportunity to discuss these two articles, highlighting the key points.</p>
<p>The ten key points of this ministry's decree are: (1) Books must be marked with a fixed price; (2) Textbook prices should be reduced; (3) Books are not allowed to have discounts; (4) Published books must have reduced prices; (5) Pre-orders have a minimum special price of 70%; (6) Stipulate discounts for wholesale purchases by industry libraries, schools, and publishers; (7) Cheap sales or book coupons are not allowed; (8) Slow-selling or damaged books may be sold in a discount section; (9) Outlying areas may add appropriate remittance and freight charges; (10) Those who violate the regulations will be sanctioned.</p>
<p>The failure to mark books with a fixed price is most common in ancient books (thread-bound books). Yuan Dynasty block prints, rare book reprints—these provide publishers with many opportunities to make money. At the same time, readers often spend high prices and do not get good books because they are unfamiliar with the inside story. Furthermore, because fixed prices are not marked, bookstores often determine the price of books based on their capital and the level of profit they want to obtain, thus readers do not know what to do, and the industry competes with each other. Therefore, the Ministry of Education's current regulation of this point is indeed a fundamental solution.</p>
<p>However, ancient books are, after all, not like new books that are published endlessly. Moreover, even after fixed prices are established, they can still be sold at 70% off, 50% off, or even a 7% discount? Therefore, Article 3 of the Ministry of Education stipulates that discounts or price increases are not allowed. In this way, not only do purchasers feel great convenience, but publishers, as the Shanghai Booksellers' Association says, "either raise the fixed price and give large discounts, or create clever names and promote fair prices, causing unfair competition among the industry and leading to unnecessary disputes and losses." This problem can also be avoided at the same time.</p>
<p>However, in order to take into account the facts, the Ministry of Education specifically stipulated Articles 5 and 8 to facilitate the publication of new books and the sale of old books. This cannot be regarded as a thorough consideration of business difficulties; at the same time, it is also a remedial measure that the publishing industry should have. Therefore, in the implementation methods formulated by the Shanghai Booksellers' Association, the methods are specified in detail in Chapters 7, 8, and 9, such as the limit on the number of times per year and the limit on the number of books, as well as the location, time, etc., which are extremely thorough.</p>
<p>In addition, the point about wholesale within the industry is quite noteworthy. In the past, I often had this experience. For example, if Commercial Press published a book, it was sold at the fixed price in the main store, but in other small bookstores, it was often available at a 70% or 80% discount. The purpose of the main store not giving discounts is to maintain its reputation and the strength of its brand, which goes without saying. However, from the 70% or 80% discount at small stores, it can be inferred that the discounts between them are large, no less than 50% or 60%. Let's look at the methods announced by the Shanghai Association. Chapter 2, wholesale rewards for the industry: elementary school textbooks and publications without copyrights, 80% to 75%; middle school textbooks, magazines, and other books, 85% to 80%; pre-ordered books, special-priced books, pre-ordered magazines, 90% to 85%. From this point, we know that the discounts between them are now smaller; in other words, the books of large bookstores such as Commercial Press that could previously be bought at 70% or 80% off in small bookstores now necessarily have to increase in price. At the same time, let's look at Article 4 of the Ministry of Education: "For published books, if the fixed price is higher due to the original discount, the respective publishers should immediately verify and reduce the price and set a real price..." Unfortunately, only Kaiming and New Life are responding to the Ministry's decree by automatically reducing book prices. Books of large bookstores like Commercial Press, which could previously be bought at 70% or 80% off (in small bookstores), now, after the methods issued by the Ministry (of course, these large bookstores have not reduced their prices), on the contrary, increase the burden on our general purchasers, and the price of books increases invisibly. This point cannot but make us suspect that Article 2 of the Ministry of Education stipulates: "The fixed price of textbooks should be based on the cost of editing and printing, appropriately determined, and strive to be low." Then, Commercial Press, China, World, and even Great East, and Beixin, which are famous for publishing textbooks, also seem to should slightly reduce their prices; otherwise, if they still sell at the previous 50% or 60% discount, it is known that they are not complying with the Ministry's order; or, they want to get through this summer vacation first and make some money first. Here, we cannot but say that the Shanghai Booksellers' Association's announcement on June 30th saying, "However, the ten articles of the Unified Book Sales Method issued by the Ministry of Education should be strictly followed by all our colleagues from this day forth; it is extremely important," is superfluous! It is vernacular! It is discussed but not implemented!</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education also knows that this method is not easy to implement; therefore, in Article 10, it is stipulated that if the rules are violated, local authorities can have considerable and effective sanctions; it is only a pity that the sanctions measures belonging to the local authorities have not been published. Although the Shanghai Booksellers' Association has specifically established Chapter 14 and stipulated four specific punishment methods, they have been postponed for some reason.</p>
<p>Now, it is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep is lost; I hope that the Ministry of Education may repeatedly order and declare to achieve success; at the same time, I hope that the Shanghai Association will not postpone it again after six months; and that booksellers in all regions will unite to break this long-standing malpractice in the publishing industry and achieve Mr. Duxiu's goal of "great flowering." That is not only a blessing for the publishing industry, but also dare to guarantee that the future of Chinese cultural undertakings will have the hope of development and glory.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Jane Eyre: An Autobiography <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Youqin</p>
<p>Written by Englishwoman C. Brontë, translated by Li Jiye, published by Living Bookstore's World Literature Series</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>This "Jane Eyre: An Autobiography" is one of the famous long novels of the 19th century. I don't know if anyone in our country has translated it before. Recently, I continued reading from the fourth volume of the World Literature Series to the twelfth volume and finally appreciated this masterpiece. According to the World Literature Series edition, it is printed on more than 420 pages, and there is no separate edition yet. I am afraid that not many people have read this masterpiece, so I would like to briefly describe it as an introduction.</p>
<p>I think this is a very valuable and interesting book, although the author, Ms. Brontë, modestly calls it an unpretentious story. She became famous with this "Jane Eyre: An Autobiography," but the pen name she used at the time was Currer Bell, not Charlotte Brontë. As soon as the novel was published, it aroused the admiration of many readers, and everyone speculated about who this new author was, but Brontë never revealed her real name. She made the following statement in the third edition of the novel: "I want to use the opportunity of the third edition of 'Jane Eyre: An Autobiography' to say one more word to the readers and explain that I have the right to be called a novelist entirely because of this work. Therefore, if other novels are considered to be written by me, the honor will be given to the undeserving; as a result, the place where the honor should be given will not be received. This explanation can be used to correct the mistakes that have already been made and prevent future mistakes. April 13, 1848, Currer Bell." From her own remarks, it can be seen how important people at the time attached to this novel.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>Regarding Ms. Brontë's life, the translator, Mr. Li Jiye, did not make an introduction, and readers probably don't know much about her, so I will specifically and briefly describe a few sentences below.</p>
<p>Brontë Charlotte is her real name. She was born in 1816 and died in 1855, living only 39 years.</p>
<p>She was the daughter of Reverend Brontë, who had the temperament of an Irishman and a naturally eccentric personality. His method of educating children was extremely special, often causing them to suffer a lot.</p>
<p>She was born in a small parsonage house close to the cemetery in a barren village of (HaworthParsonege), which cultivated her solitary nature. And in her childhood, she lost her kind mother. Because she was older, she had to take on the responsibility of her mother, taking care of and educating her two younger sisters. One was named Emily, and the other was named Anne, who eventually received her great help and also enjoyed a great reputation in the literary world. (These characters are quite relevant to the characterization of several supporting roles in "Jane Eyre: An Autobiography.")</p>
<p>After many efforts, she worked as a school teacher and a governess. Later, she and her sisters gathered funds to print some collections of poetry, signed as Currer, Ellis, or Acton, Bell. (This is slightly different from the pen name in "Jane Eyre: An Autobiography.") But the results were mediocre and did not receive much attention or welcome. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e193">Leukocyte Increasing Therapy <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Yang Daonan, Medical Doctor of the Russian Labor Medical University</p>
<p>Enhancing the function of cell substance is the key to eradicating systemic gonococcal toxins and restoring diseased tissues.</p>
<p>Readers must have some experience in understanding the treatment of gonorrhea. Gonococci are highly resistant and reproduce rapidly. Once infected, they invade the posterior urethra from the urethral mucosa and soon spread throughout the body. The most notable are gonococcal arthritis, which causes disability, endocarditis, which causes sudden death, suppurative osteomyelitis, which is dangerous, iritis and conjunctivitis, which cause eye problems, and other neurological diseases. Complications arise one after another, without exception. Can a local membrane-penetrating bactericidal treatment accomplish the task? This is clearly demonstrated in chronic gonorrhea patients who have used membrane-penetrating bactericidal therapy.</p>
<p>Therefore, prominent Western scholars in modern times have reversed the old, clumsy, and unreasonable theories and created the great theory of leucocytosentherapie, which Dr. Peter has summarized. They adopted lipids and protein bodies, combined with pure pigments to make "Kelinong." After taking it, it immediately increases leukocytes, making every gonococcus in every part of the body wiped out. And the root of the gonococcus is cut off! As for the lesions, such as the anterior urethra in acute cases, the inflamed testes, prostate, joints in chronic cases, and the urethra, vagina, and uterus in women's erosion and inflammation, the damaged tissues can be fully restored to health due to "Kelinong's" enhancement of the function of cell substance. The function of this drug is truly unprecedented. Its non-irritation of the stomach and the absence of any side effects are far superior to various old and counterfeit new drugs. Purchasers should pay close attention to the word "Kelinong."</p>
<p>I have stayed in Russia for more than ten years and have treated many venereal diseases. The speed with which this medicine treats male and female gonorrhea and leucorrhea is directly superior to 606 in the treatment of syphilis and far exceeds it. How great! The success of gonorrhea therapy!</p>

<p>— Dr. Wu Zhonglin</p>
<p>A woman's menstruation is a physiological phenomenon and there is nothing mysterious about it. However, if it deviates from the natural physiological laws, menstruation will not come on time. There are also various painful symptoms during menstruation. The biggest causes are abnormalities in the ovaries and corpus luteum, and abnormalities in the uterus and other adjacent organs! It can also affect menstruation. Women with such menstrual diseases should correct them in order to avoid the progression of the disease, which can damage fertility, or even lead to fatal uterine pain.</p>
<p>According to my many years of clinical experience, women with irregular menstruation also have symptoms such as lower back pain, leucorrhea, dizziness, heart palpitations, poor appetite, and anemia. The only appropriate treatment is to take the female hormone preparation "Bunürong," which is most effective. This is because this medicine has the ability to correct unhealthy organs such as the ovaries and uterus, so menstruation is adjusted accordingly. And health and fertility are restored. Mrs. Kang Liyun has been married for five or six years and has always lacked regular menstruation. Her body is very weak, and she is about to fall in the wind, so she has never had children. She has repeatedly taken all kinds of medicines to regulate menstruation and nourish blood without any effect. Later, she changed to my treatment. After examination, it was found that she lacked follicle-stimulating hormone. She was instructed to go to the Chinese and Western pharmacy to buy and take "Bunürong" to increase her stimulating hormone, and to use "Kashi Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories to clear leucorrhea. With both internal and external care, after more than a month, her menstrual water came on time, and her body became stronger. As a result, she gave birth to a son a year later, realizing the importance of the relationship between menstruation, fertility, and physical health.</p>
<h3 id="e195">The Process of Gastroenteritis Becoming Chronic <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Chen Shaohua</p>
<p>Among the diseases prevalent in hot weather, gastroenteritis is the most common. This is because residents like to eat raw and cold foods and are careless about their diet, causing damage to the gastrointestinal function. As a result, severe stomach pain, vomiting, fever, fatigue, diarrhea, and fullness in the chest occur. This is acute inflammation and should be quickly treated with "Qiangweijing" to reduce inflammation and prevent corruption, stop vomiting and relieve pain. Then, corrupt food can be cleared by excretion, and the function of the stomach and intestines will return to normal. Therefore, there will be no complications such as gastric ulcer, gastric cancer, gastric prolapse, and dilatation.</p>
<p>If anesthetic preparations are mistakenly taken to stop vomiting and diarrhea and relieve pain during the acute phase, although they will be temporarily effective, they will inevitably turn into chronic conditions. The main symptoms of chronic gastrointestinal disease are, in short, indigestion. Specifically, there are chest congestion, frequent belching, acid reflux, fear of food, hidden abdominal pain after eating, constipation, or undigested grains and loose stools. The method of treatment is to take "Qiangweijing" as the first priority. "Qiangweijing" mainly has this complex effect. Its preparation contains rich yeast, which not only helps digestion, but also provides nourishment. It is extremely effective for severe, unrecoverable stomach disorders and infant vomiting of milk and green stools! It is also effective for smokers with weak stomachs, constipation, and addiction treatment. This is because "Qiangweijing" is rich in lecithin, which is sufficient to help clear the nicotine in the blood. However, it is best to take "Butikang" at the same time to radically treat weakness and avoid recurrence of old diseases.</p>
<p>"Qiangweijing" is also good at treating athlete's foot because it contains a lot of vitamin B. In addition, for stomach weakness caused by spermatorrhea or loss of appetite caused by tuberculosis, in addition to taking "Qiangweijing" to strengthen the stomach, it is advisable to also take "Yujingpian" to stop spermatorrhea and "Butikang" to replenish sperm, or to also take "Bufei Nauer" to fight bacteria and eliminate hemorrhoids. Zhongxi Yong'an and major pharmacies all sell it. Those who are resting can treat themselves according to the law.</p>

<p>Treatment requires absolute faith and perseverance.</p>
<p>The organization of the lungs is different from other internal organs of the human body. Its cells are delicate and lack resistance, and it also lacks sensation. Even if the inside is ulcerated, the person's appearance is no different. Only when resistance declines, the bacterial toxins flow into the blood through the lymph, resulting in phenomena such as night sweats, tidal fever, and loss of appetite. However, there are also those who find it sooner or later due to differences in human strength. Among the patients I have treated, half of them have one or two cavities in their lungs, but they do not feel anything on the surface. Only when they suddenly coughed up blood or came to me for consultation due to a cold and cough, it was found that they had been suffering from tuberculosis for five or six years. In addition, the early stage of pulmonary apical catarrh is often similar to a cold: frequent coughing up phlegm, sharp reduction in appetite, physical and mental fatigue, etc., which can be regarded as early-onset tuberculosis.</p>
<p>Once lung tissue is occupied by tubercle bacillus, it is swallowed and eaten by it, eventually becoming a cavity. To make it heal and recover, the only way is to use "Bufei Nauer" invented by Dr. Tumei to increase connective tissue and enhance antibacterial ability. Then, the tubercle bacillus can be eradicated, and the cavity can be healed. It can achieve complete success in three to four weeks to eight to nine weeks for coughing up blood, tidal fever, red cheeks, night sweats, thick sputum, chest pain, decreased appetite, and weight loss. For those who also have neurasthenia, forgetfulness, insomnia, heart palpitations, etc., men can also take "Butikang" (this is also good for treating kidney atrophy, premature ejaculation, and lower back pain. If suffering from spermatorrhea and seminal leakage, it is advisable to take "Yujingpian" together to treat it). Women can take "Bunürong" (this medicine also treats irregular menstruation. If there is leucorrhea in the body, "Kashi Vaginal Tablets" can be used externally). The above designated collections can be purchased from the Western Medicine Department of Wing On Company and major pharmacies. It is essential to have absolute faith and perseverance in the consultation, then the treatment can be eradicated without praise.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Terrible Severe Spermatorrhea <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Bachelor of Medicine Wu Zhonglin, Nantong Medical University</p>
<p>The types of spermatorrhea can be divided into the following categories:</p>
<p>(1) Nocturnal Emission (2) Seminal Discharge (3) Seminal Leakage (4) Premature Ejaculation</p>
<p>Nocturnal emission is the most common type of spermatorrhea. It is caused by erotic dreams. Its pathology is hypersensitivity of the ejaculation center and weakness of the reproductive nerve.</p>
<p>Seminal discharge is nocturnal emission without dreams. It is caused by relaxation of the vas deferens, so there is no feeling during leakage. These two diseases should be treated by purchasing "Yujingpian" from Chinese and Western pharmacies to suppress nerves, strengthen the ejaculation center, and tighten the vas deferens. After taking it for three to four weeks, it can be completely cured. If you take those slow-acting ordinary preparations, or even mistakenly take inferior medicines, damaging the delicate tissues inside the reproductive glands, or delay treatment, you will fall into a terrible severe condition and become seminal leakage.</p>
<p>Patients with seminal leakage often enter the erotic scene. As soon as they see the opposite sex, they experience extreme impulse and semen flows out. Or after bowel movements. Or after exertion, semen also leaks out. This leads to premature ejaculation and kidney weakness. It is then necessary to simultaneously use "Yujingpian" to consolidate the seminal system and contract the prostate, and "Butikang" to save the weak function.</p>
<p>In my experience, all types of spermatorrhea, such as nocturnal emission, seminal discharge, seminal leakage, and premature ejaculation, should be treated with Butikang and Yujingpian, combining "tonifying" and "consolidation." Moreover, spermatorrhea is mostly caused by masturbation, and these two medicines can also stop masturbation.</p>
<p>If spermatorrhea is caused by lung disease or acute gonorrhea, in addition to taking this medicine, you should also take "Bufei Nauer" to cure lung disease or "Kelinong" to cure gonorrhea. The medicinal properties are all orthodox, so you can use them with peace of mind.</p>
<h3 id="e198">An Endocrine Preparation That Has Been Successfully Tested <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Chen Zongkun, Imperial Medical University of Japan</p>
<p>From animal experiments to human experiments</p>
<p>The most noteworthy thing in 20th-century medicine is the prosperity of the endocrine theory. Since the German Beidote's invention of the endocrine theory in the mid-19th century, it has been less than a hundred years, and its progress is faster than any science, but there are still many deficiencies in the experimental aspects. Among them, the research results of the German Meren are the most outstanding. The male "Butikang" and female "Bunürong" medicines invented by him are made from the endocrine secretions of strong animals of both sexes, and are indeed effective for symptoms of incomplete development of both sexes. Mr. Meren mixed this preparation into the food and fed it to a male dog (i.e., the dog on the right side of the picture) with hypothyroidism and rickets. After continuing to feed it for more than 50 days, there was an amazing progress in development. The thigh bones grew longer, and the waist, body, and head also increased greatly. The posture was majestic and slender, like a fierce lion (i.e., the dog on the left side of the picture). After Mr. Meren's animal experiments were successful, he conducted further research, and after many years of experiments, he refined successfully human oral tablets using strict disinfection procedures. And the application to clinical experiments finally achieved success. As a result, "Butikang" and "Bunürong" have become popular all over the world and are a blessing to the general public. Those with congenital incomplete development and incomplete development due to acquired masturbation, excessive sexual activity, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, headache, insomnia, weak memory, anemia, irregular menstruation in women, and poor development of breasts and buttocks, respectively take these two medicines, and the effects are immediately visible. Both medicines are sold in major pharmacies in the country.</p>

<h3 id="e199">Emergency Treatment of Chronic Gonorrhea <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Song Zongyu, Medical Doctor of the Army Medical University</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Sun Shenghai, 25 years old, has had gonorrhea for six years. He has taken almost all membrane-penetrating bactericidal gonorrhea drugs and urethral irrigations, but the symptoms have not decreased and have tended to increase. When he came to me for treatment, he had chronic gonococcal cystitis, frequent urination, and the discharge was like flocs, sometimes floating on the surface of the urine, with a lot of sediment, and pain in the lower abdomen. After examination with a cystoscope, the inflammation inside was found to be very severe. I then administered "Kelinong" to reduce inflammation, kill bacteria, and fight gonorrhea. After taking it for five weeks, the inflammation subsided, urination became easy, and the urine was clear and clean, no different from normal people. More than a dozen examinations were performed with a microscope, and there was no trace of gonococci, which proved that he was completely cured. His wife had also been suffering from leucorrhea for a long time. Following my instructions, she used "Kar's Vaginal Tablets" externally as suppositories and took "Kelinong" internally. After a month, both gonorrhea and leucorrhea were completely cured.</p>
<p>(Treatment Review) If there was a truly membrane-penetrating bactericidal drug during the acute phase of Mr. Sun's disease, it would have had a small effect. However, once it has become cystitis, even if it has the function of penetrating the membrane and killing bacteria, it is difficult to be effective. This is because the bladder is already inflamed and swollen, and the mucosal tissue is destroyed, so there is no membrane to penetrate. In addition, bladder irrigation was often used to treat this disease in the past, but when the symptoms have reached this stage, irrigation has become ineffective. This kind of irrigation often scatters gonococci everywhere. The harm is even greater. I used the internal medicine "Kelinong" to reduce inflammation, prevent corruption, relieve pain, and eliminate gonorrhea. Therefore, it can be completely cured in a short period of time. This is indeed the safest and most effective treatment method.</p>

<p>Gonorrhea Easily Leads to Neurasthenia</p>
<p>There are many causes of sexual neurasthenia, but most are due to masturbation, excessive sexual activity, etc. However, gonorrhea, when it becomes chronic, can also easily lead to this disease. This is because gonococcal toxins invade the lymphatic system, stimulating the nervous center, resulting in an allergic reaction. For example, nocturnal emission in chronic gonorrhea is due to this reason, eventually leading to extreme neurasthenia, also known as premature ejaculation. It is not uncommon for one person to suffer from several of these diseases. This consumes vital energy, and the body becomes weak, which is truly precarious. However, there are many such cases clinically, which is truly heartbreaking to witness.</p>
<p>Patient Qian Zishu was a man of uninhibited nature, fond of dalliances with prostitutes, and eventually contracted gonorrhea. Although he underwent various treatments, he seemed to have recovered on the surface. However, within a few months, his illness relapsed. Since then, it has relapsed and been treated repeatedly, and chronic inflammation of the seminal system has developed, with spontaneous emission of semen and a listless expression. Fortunately, his wife was understanding and deeply comforted him. Mr. Qian was even more touched, but he suffered from the inability to sustain marital pleasure, almost ejaculating at the slightest touch, and also infected his wife with the disease, causing her to suffer from severe gonorrheal leukorrhea, with more than half of her vagina eroded. Mr. Qian felt even more guilty, taking medicine every night without fail, but unfortunately, the virus had penetrated deeply, and it was not easy to achieve results. Introduced by a friend, he came to me for treatment. In addition to electrical therapy and X-ray therapy, I instructed him to purchase and take the German "Klinon" and "Bodycon" from various pharmacies. "Klinon" can fight gonorrhea, kill bacteria, relieve pain, and reduce inflammation, and can directly exert a bactericidal effect on the lesion. It is further supplemented with "Bodycon" to suppress the nerves and promote the strengthening of the gonads, so that the sexual nerves can restore their original health. After taking it for five weeks, he was completely cured. A blood test was performed, and there was no positive reaction. This is a subtle way to eradicate gonorrhea, and the problem of nocturnal emission was also cured at the same time. His wife's leukorrhea was also treated with "Klinon" internally and "Carl Scheddi's Vaginal Tablets" externally as suppositories, and she was completely cured after one month. They have lived together since then without recurrence.</p>

<p>Clinic: Across from Tonghe Bank on Ningbo Road</p>
<p>Leukorrhea is to women as a white jade is to being stained. If it is not quickly removed, there will never be happy days. Observing those who suffer from leukorrhea, not only does their beauty disappear, but the local pain is also most unbearable, such as vaginal erosion, stinging pain, abdominal distension, discomfort, and difficult menstruation. The leukorrhea that is discharged is always grayish-white or reddish-yellow, covering the tissues and organs near the vagina and uterus, causing them to be infiltrated and damaged by the leukorrhea, which is often the main cause of infertility. A woman's suffering from leukorrhea is also like an invisible shackle on her body. To break this shackle, you must use medicinal tablets that prevent decay, reduce inflammation, fight bacteria, and stop secretion.</p>
<p>The suppositories used by general patients do not address the root cause, so they are ultimately ineffective. However, according to our practical experience, whether it is long-term leukorrhea or leukorrhea caused by various reasons, "Carl Scheddi's Vaginal Tablets" can be used as suppositories, and their efficacy is faster and more thorough than any other leukorrhea suppositories. This tablet is rich in anti-decay, anti-secretion, and germ-killing functions, and can thoroughly remove all leukorrhea in three or four weeks. This is a well-known fact among patients who have used this tablet. However, if the husband transmits gonorrhea, in addition to using this tablet, "Klinon" can be taken at the same time to eliminate the gonococci deep in the blood, and the effect will be even more surprisingly fast. I have often seen women who have been cured of leukorrhea by using one "Carl's Vaginal Tablet," and their spirits are all joyful. It is truly "light as a feather."</p>
<h3 id="e202">On the Pharmacology of Phlegm-Reducing and Cough-Suppressing Drugs <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Deng Yuanhe, Dean of Shanghai Hunan People's Hospital</p>
<p>Excessive phlegm is a sign of an unhealthy lung. A healthy lung naturally produces little secretion. Conversely, excessive phlegm, whether thick and dark gray, or thin and white and frothy, or black phlegm expectorated in the morning, are all bad signs. Coughing is an accompanying symptom of phlegm production. Sometimes a dry cough without phlegm is mostly a slight sign of tuberculosis. Coughing up phlegm due to a cold is acute catarrhal bronchitis. When this symptom is severe, it often leads to asthma, which is most common in middle-aged and elderly people. In children, it can cause bronchial spasms and pertussis. Chronic bronchitis is commonly known as chronic cough with phlegm.</p>
<p>Although there are many cough and phlegm medicines sold on the market, very few are truly effective. All phlegm-reducing and cough-suppressing drugs are Kreosot preparations from coal oil. This was discovered by Mr. Reichenbach in coal oil in 1830, but its side effects are very large, irritating the stomach and reducing appetite.</p>
<p>Therefore, the lung disease expert Dr. Peter of Germany extracted pure and flawless Lresol from Kreosot and combined it with other special chemical components to make "Pulmonal," which is extremely effective for catarrhal respiratory diseases. It effectively removes phlegm, suppresses cough, relieves asthma, and calms the heart. For colds or asthma, taking four or five bottles will bring relief. Pertussis in children and chronic cough with phlegm can be completely cured by taking eight or nine bottles. It has been tested on many people, and there are existing medical records to prove it.</p>

<h3 id="e205">Written After the Closing of the World Jewish Congress <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Xiaoming</p>
<p>The World Jewish Congress has closed. Looking at the resolutions of the Congress, such as the protest against the expulsion of Jews by the German National Socialist Party, the request for the Soviet Union to allow Jews within its borders to freely practice Judaism, the request for all countries to stop prosecuting Jews participating in the movement to rebuild their homeland... etc., we can believe that the Jewish nation is excellent, at least not as inferior as the German Hitler's followers cursed.</p>
<p>What particularly highlights the heroism of the Jews is their severe resistance to the German National Socialist Party! They called on Jews around the world to boycott German goods as a response from the entire nation to the persecutors.</p>
<p>The Jews have always lacked the guarantee of their own national political power. They were not united and were subjected to discrimination by foreign races, which often led to innocent bullying. However, the spirit of this World Jewish Congress is sufficient to declare to the world, whether oppressors or sympathizers, the strength of the unity of the Jewish nation.</p>
<p>In Germany, since Hitler came to power, in order to expand its aggressive diplomacy externally and divert the public's attention from the social crisis internally, all the causes of Germany's poverty and weakness were blamed on the Jews. Hitler said in "Mein Kampf" that the destruction and wounds of Germany were entirely caused by the promiscuity of Jewish men and women, which disrupted the bloodline of the Germanic nation. Therefore, Hitler opposed Bolshevism and told German workers that Marx was a Jew. Hitler opposed science that revealed objective truth and said that Einstein was a Jew. Hitler banned films that satirized capitalism, also on the pretext that Charlie Chaplin was a Jew...</p>
<p>In short, the "anti-Jewish movement" has become a multifaceted tool for Hitler. Because it is a multifaceted tool, the damage is not limited to the Jews themselves, but extends to the entire world's lovers of freedom and culture.</p>
<p>Currently, this persecution of small ethnic groups and ethnic cultures is expanding. In Australia and the United States, Hitler's associates are also brewing anti-Jewish movements.</p>
<p>At this time, the convening of the World Jewish Congress is worthy of our excitement and sympathy. In the name of a similarly discriminated nation, we should express our respect to the courageous Jews and hope that they will firmly implement the resolutions of national self-defense after the closing of the conference. We believe that their actions can overcome the enemy's insults and win the support of the world's public who love cultural freedom.</p>
<p>In Hitler's writings, the Chinese nation is also a "degenerate race" and is ranked alongside pigs and dogs. If our nation is not even lower than the Jews, what should we express?</p>
<p>We should think about our position and the treatment of overseas Chinese!</p>

<p>— Ai Tu</p>
<p>Since I came to Guangzhou, I always go to bed very late. It seems to be the inertia of my wandering nature. In every quiet late night, there are no pedestrians on the streets, only the familiar Dong Dong drumbeat of the watchman can be heard. A vast expanse of blue clouds covers the earth. At this time, I am very willing to drag my tired legs and limp to wander around. I do this until the fourth or fifth watch, and sometimes even until the rooster crows, before I quietly step onto the old building.</p>
<p>The summer nights in the South are so worthy of my lingering. Sometimes, I am simply like a human explorer, curiously observing everything in the dark streets. Because of this, I have been close to the many, many homeless people every night. However, these countless homeless people often occupy the entire sidewalk of the road. Sometimes, late at night, when I send Annie home, the countless shadows frighten them.</p>
<p>"Look, our doorway is blocked!" That fellow will definitely scold again when he sees it!"</p>
<p>If other women said this, I would definitely think that it contained endless resentment and boredom. But who would believe that Annie is the same as those noble ladies or young ladies? No! I can see from her tone that it contains endless sympathy and lament! Because I know that her life is close to these people. Although she also argues with the so-called upper-class young ladies sometimes, she is a daughter who has long hated everything in the current society.</p>
<p>Our doorway has been occupied by the homeless people, leaving only half a foot of space for us to enter and exit. One day, our landlord roared like an angry lion, calling the police to drive them away:</p>
<p>"No way! Sleeping at the door, looking like several corpses, is unsightly!"</p>
<p>He woke up the people who were sleeping soundly. We watched from behind with wide eyes and felt a little sad. When the landlord was gesturing so arrogantly, Annie sighed and said, "He was also born poor, a person without a home, raised by others, and becomes so arrogant when he gets rich?" But what else can we say? We watched with wide eyes as those people pleaded:</p>
<p>"Sir! Boss! We have no place to sleep!"</p>
<p>"Go somewhere else! Guangzhou is so big!"</p>
<p>"Other places are full of people! And it has rained, the ground is too wet! Look, the Song arcade is not a good place to sleep!"</p>
<p>"No way! My doorway is not your home! You are like corpses."</p>
<p>I saw these many innocent, ragged people walk away in anger.</p>
<p>In this way, I always saw countless homeless people on the streets. They had no clothes, were barefoot, and had naked legs. Every night, they occupied both sides of the road. They were hungry all day long, had no work, and writhed like countless insects in the corners. At night, they endured the wind and rain, gritting their teeth and letting the merciless mosquitoes suck their blood and flesh. But they couldn't even sleep happily!</p>
<p>I felt that the streets at night were filled with tragic shadows. We often saw the tragedy of the police driving away the homeless people for the landlord. Their fierce legs often frequented their bodies, especially when it rained, they were fighting for a place to sleep, searching in the dark corners like mice. But everywhere was already occupied by other people sleeping, so they would lower their heads and run to another place in disappointment.</p>
<p>When a new official took office, the first order issued, perhaps he thought it was the greatest miracle, the order meant this: "There are 20,000 displaced people in Guangzhou, who sleep on the streets every night, with bare arms and legs, which obstructs the view, and there are those who take the opportunity to disturb public order, which should be strictly prohibited..."</p>
<p>After this order was issued, the sticks of the police officers also became busy.</p>
<p>However, this huge whip, like a tiger, was applied to these 20,000 homeless people. Every night, isn't it still full of homeless people? One day, Annie said to me like this:</p>
<p>"It's really strange, why don't these officials understand that people have no place to sleep? Prohibition! Does the government have a place for them to sleep? Ha! It seems that they want them to die!"</p>
<p>I saw her shaking her head, but I didn't want to say anything. (Notes from Yangshi)</p>

<p>— Xiu Yang</p>
<p>The exposed corpse was discovered by the water-carrier A Gen on the river beach.</p>
<p>Water-carrying in this town is an independent business. A Gen's grandfather relied on a special force to monopolize it, so his father and A Gen himself were named after their profession.</p>
<p>The shops and residents in this town rely on A Gen to deliver their daily water. Even those who are busy with their handicrafts also have to have A Gen carry a few loads of water.</p>
<p>At dawn, A Gen would jump out of bed, carry his water buckets that he depended on for survival to the river beach, and then deliver water door-to-door according to the distance. He would fill the water tanks for the shops and residents according to how much water they needed each day, and in addition, there were short-term businesses. He hardly had time to take a cigarette break the entire morning.</p>
<p>That day, he was carrying water buckets and singing mountain songs when he walked to the river beach. He saw a naked female corpse lying on the river beach. The corpse was already bloated, and the sky was not yet bright. A Gen was so frightened that he shouted.</p>
<p>Before long, many people had gathered around the river beach to watch the excitement. Some people also went to call the local constable to try to move the corpse ashore, covered the lower body with reeds, and asked someone the local constable had brought to knock on gongs in the streets and alleys, asking family members to come and identify the corpse.</p>
<p>Sure enough, more and more people came to watch the excitement, but no one came to identify the corpse. The corpse, roughly, had been soaked in the water for too long. The facial features had already rotted, and no one could guess who she was.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the local constable went to the charitable hall to get a coffin and buried her in the public cemetery.</p>
<p>Here, the problem of drinking water arose. Everyone watched as a rotting corpse was carried ashore from the river. The shops and residents wanted A Gen to carry water from the big river ten miles away. A Gen naturally raised objections, saying:</p>
<p>"For ten copper coins a load of water, I have to run to the big river ten miles away. I can't earn a few hundred copper coins all day long. Who wants to do it! The corpse might have floated in from the big river. Isn't that a waste of effort?"</p>
<p>The users still firmly objected. They would rather not drink water. A Gen also angrily sent the water buckets home and went to the tavern.</p>
<p>The tavern was making this incident the news. The boss, the waiter, and the drinkers were all discussing it. When A Gen stepped into the tavern, because he was the one who discovered the corpse, everyone surrounded him and asked him questions.</p>
<p>A Gen couldn't do business today, and his stomach was full of grievances with no place to vent. He banged on the table and said, "Hmph, so excited about a female corpse. Do you want to fuck a dead woman?" He called the waiter to get wine, and then muttered to himself, "Let them go three days without drinking water!"</p>
<p>But the inexplicable corpse was too exciting. The drinkers were still privately discussing it, as if they were responsible for the investigation.</p>
<p>On this day, wherever two people in the town gathered, they were talking about this incident.</p>
<p>Until the lamps were lit, the local constable rushed into the tavern, pulled A Gen and said:</p>
<p>"The corpse has been identified. It's the wife of Official Chen. The police station wants you to question you."</p>
<p>A Gen was already slightly drunk. He grabbed the local constable and said, "Damn it, it's not my wife, ask what the bird!"</p>
<p>"Brother A Gen, that's not what I meant," the local constable always met resistance. He pleaded with A Gen, because you were the first to discover it, and they want you to be a witness. The town is already in a panic without water to drink, and the superiors are desperately trying to solve the case!"</p>
<p>A Gen laughed. He knew the power of his business. "Not drinking water, isn't not drinking water good for survival?" He grumbled and went to the police station with the local constable.</p>
<p>Official Chen had already fled. A Gen, with a lisp, told the police officer how he discovered the corpse. After the police station posted a wanted notice for the murderer, they only discussed the issue of the town's impending water shortage.</p>
<p>That was a murder case that occurred in the hometown in early spring. Official Chen has not been brought to justice to this day, and the people in the town no longer remember that sensational news. Every morning, the sound of A Gen's mountain song is singing again by the river beach.</p>

<p>— Fang Zhou</p>
<p>(Special Report from This Newspaper) One new autumn afternoon, I boarded the public bus in Nanshi to Longhua to visit the Shanghai Orphanage.</p>
<p>The bus climbed up that long, wide cinder road, bumping very badly. The stench from the small muddy rivers drilled in through the car window in bursts, often making me cover my nose. The fields and houses on both sides flashed past like flying. We were getting further and further away from the city.</p>
<p>After getting off the bus in front of the Longhua Headquarters, I found the Shanghai Orphanage. Without notifying the gatekeeper, I went straight inside. It was an orchard, planted entirely with honey peach trees. Walking along a wide path in the middle, crossing a small bridge, it was another garden. Here there were also flowers, trees, pavilions, terraces, lawns, and rivers. Outside the garden was a row of tall willows, sheltering the sidewalk. At this time, several orphans were weeding by the side of the garden, laughing and playing, very lively.</p>
<p>Going in through a wooden fence gate, the outermost was the reception room; outside the room were placed two vats of lotus flowers and many other potted plants. We stood at the door of the room, wanting to find someone to report to the director here. At that time, an old nanny happened to come out from inside. I explained my intentions to her and gave her a business card. She took the business card, invited me into the reception room to sit for a while, and ordered a child to offer tea, and went next door to report.</p>
<p>The reception room was decorated very simply and elegantly. On the walls, in addition to many photos of the orphanage scenes and orphans' lives and work, there were also portraits of several deceased directors. There was also a photo of Mr. Shi Liangcai, the former owner of this newspaper, hanging on the wall, because Mr. Shi had donated 500 yuan to the orphanage's education fund.</p>
<p>While I was browsing the room, Director Zhang Jifu walked in. He was a kind and amiable old man. From his kind smile, we could see his character.</p>
<p>"Let's go next door to talk. It's quieter there," he said, gesturing for us to walk in front.</p>

<p>Her Daughter A Cai...Hui Ying</p>
<p>Sister A Qiao...Sun</p>
<p>Foreman Xu...Tan Guang</p>
<p>Bonded Laborer</p>
<p>Because of the oppression and exploitation of imperialism, the suffering of the Chinese working class and peasants is like the rising tide, drowning the workers and peasants so they cannot survive. Here, it exposes a realistic side of this corrupt old society - we heard every line and it seemed like we saw their dangerous and miserable expressions, and their dying struggles; and saw the cunning and vicious eyes of the traitors, and that bloody whip.</p>
<p>Here is the home of a plasterer. The plasterer, Qian Liansheng, builds Western-style buildings for those who exploit him every day, but he himself lives in a low, narrow thatched shed, living an inhuman life of not enough food and clothing. Now he has broken his arm while working and suffered a serious chest injury, but has been abandoned by the exploiters. He lies in bed, sickness and unemployment are the instruments of torture that could strangle him.</p>
<p>"Even if I recover, what's the use of having only one arm? Isn't it just waiting to starve to death?" he said sadly and angrily.</p>
<p>His wife accompanied him, her old tears streaming down her face. They thought of their daughter, A Xiu, waiting for Foreman Xu to pay the price for A Xiu's year as a bonded laborer – eight yuan – so they could buy medicine and see a doctor. However, they were afraid, worrying that A Xiu would be subjected to prison-like abuse. Because "bonded labor" means handing over the daughter to the foreman to work for three years, for a total price of thirty yuan, but during these three years the parents cannot see their daughter again, and the foreman is not responsible for her life or death. Therefore, the foreman can abuse the bonded laborers without any scruples, even more cruelly than slaves.</p>
<p>"Humph! Working hard like a beast for three hundred and sixty days a year, you only earn ten yuan. " The father only answered a smile to the mother's hope and consolation.</p>
<p>Indeed, the lives of laborers are only starvation, beatings, scolding, until they are exploited to death. Not only is this the case for plasterers and bonded laborers, but also for Auntie Li, the neighbor who sews sacks, who also came to say:</p>
<p>"Ever since the Japanese came and attacked Shanghai, everything is over! Before, we could earn more than thirty cents a day sewing sacks, and sometimes even more than forty cents! Now, well, we are so tired from sewing every day that we can't even earn twenty cents!" Then she revealed her sympathy for Qian Liansheng.</p>
<p>However, laborers living in this corrupt society can eat half full with twenty cents a day; but in these twenty cents, they have to pay for the thatched shed tax and all other kinds of expenses. Then the police can slap the daughter of the neighbor who cannot pay the thatched fence tax, and the neighbor runs home, preparing to be scolded.</p>
<p>And the female worker A Qiao came, her mouth full of gray sighs. She told the story of a bonded laborer who could not bear the hardship and hanged herself. This increased the mother's anxiety.</p>
<p>At this time, Qian Liansheng's daughter, A Xiu, ran back alone from the factory because she could not bear the abuse. She had a bad cold, dizziness, and a fever, but still had to work; today she really couldn't, she couldn't get out of bed, but the foreman still forced her to go to the night shift, and beat her, threatening her that if she didn't go to the night shift, he would take her life. So she ran home when she was dismissed from work.</p>
<p>From then on, life made the plasterer and the bonded laborer, as well as the kind mother, thoroughly understand this society.</p>
<p>But before the oppressed can unite into a vast force, Foreman Xu uses strong-arm tactics to drag his daughter A Xiu back to the hell-like factory. And he punched her father! Kicked over her mother!</p>

<p>Changchun is beautiful. Peach and plum blossoms are particularly fragrant. The national beauty peony blooms with wealth. The peony imitates the peony in a competition of fragrance. Thousands of reds and purples welcome the spring. Attracting butterflies to fly everywhere. Cuckoos sing endlessly on the branches. But it teaches me, although I face the dressing table, I am too lazy to dress up.</p>
