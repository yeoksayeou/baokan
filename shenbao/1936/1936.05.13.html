<h3 id="c8">舉辦地政 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>— 力</p>
<p>地方高級行政人員會議開幕了在行政院的領導下有十省的地方高級行政人員聚首一堂並有負實際政洽責任的領袖親臨致訓實不能不說是我國最近政治上一件大事</p>
<p>行政院蔣院長在叙述會議的各個要點時很鄭重的提出了地政問題說：「要曉得土地問題是政治上一個根本問題土地行政是政治上一種基本工作如果土地行政不能舉辦完善土地問題不能相當解决政治建設不但不能成功而且無法推進」政治的狀况本來是建築在經濟條件上的</p>
<p>在未曾得到「各省籌辦地政的情形報吿」以前我們不敢揣測這個會議關於地政問題將作何種「共同的决議」但我們希望這回會議的結果决不是以整理士地爲開端以增加租稅爲結局當然沒有一個富足的國家會有貧窮的政府然若政府一舉一動皆以增加稅收爲目的則國家無論如何不會富足</p>
<p>把土地問題當作一個政治根本問題來解决則在土地問題中無疑包含有兩個重大的問題其一是分配土地使其最適於民生的改進其一是改良士地使其有生產力上的增加</p>
<p>有許多人連若干經濟學者在內認這二方面是可以分開進行的看重土地分配論的一派認土地只要分割開來使無土地的貧農成爲自耕的農民則農村的復興可指日以待而看重土地改良的一派則以今日我國祇有小貧大貧之別因而認增加生產是唯一的經濟問題</p>
<p>這兩派各執着眞理的一部分不開闢荒地或增加土地生產力單是把已經耕作的土地分開來恐未必能增加貧民的幸福與我國的全面積比較我國的人口固然還很稀疏但若生產的技術不增進徒以現耕的土地分配於人民卽使平均亦未必能有怎樣的效果反之不限制土地所有權的應用土地改良的口號恐怕終久是一個口號在現狀下政府旣不能代人民担負改良土地的責任它自然要把改良的責任加在人民自己身上但須知道無土地所有權的耕作者沒有改良土地的意思不耕作土地的土地所有者還更沒有改良土地的意思</p>
<p>我們認爲士地分配的工作必須與十地改良的工作一同進行不錯的現政府所需要的决不是土地所有權的革命但把無人使用的土地至少把無人管理的土地無代價的任無土地而有耕作能力的貧民去開墾去改良並充分保障他們的利益在地政問題上乃是起碼的工作若連此亦談不到就不知道地政問題還有什麽意義了</p>
<p>這種工作的先决問題决不是經費僅有機關沒有工作的弊病是我國凡百措施皆無顯著成效的最大原因幾個地政機關的成立至多能養活幾個知識份子</p>
<p>這種工作的先决問題是根本經濟政策的决定政府果有履行它的任務—憲法草案一百二十條「國家對於土地之分配整理以扶植自耕農及自行使用土地人爲原則」—的决心它所要做的祇是掃除這種工作的阻碍具體言之祇是便利農民的遷徙使土地名義上的所有者不敢阻撓實際耕作者的侵入並保障農民由勞力所得的利益使土地有益益改良的可能而巳</p>

<p>和平方式舉行開會</p>
<p>五月是個多事的月，尤其是在這多事的北平、所以四月三十日下午三時、公安局長陳繼淹、召集臨時治安會議、决定在「五一」勞働節那天、全市警察和保安隊、一律停止休息、加緊防範宵小乘機搗亂、果然那天情形、總算平安渡過、隔一天是「五三」慘案紀念、亦幸無意外事件、跟着來的、是「五四」運動的十七週年紀念、</p>
<p>好幾天前、就傳遍了一個不准舉行任何紀念會的消息、連當時做着大本營其後在校歷上每年特別添上與他校不同而放假一天的「北大」、據學校當局表示、本年也暫時取消這天例假、所以二日下午、北大各班代表、會議於該校第四宿舍會客廳、决議用所謂「和平方式」去照舊舉行紀念儀式、所調「和平方式」、內容共有三點、　絕對用和平態度出之、　絕對不罷課、不遊行、　祗限於開紀念會及發紀念宜言、在這方式下、才從學校當局取得了開紀念會的同意、也才從地方當局、取得了開紀念會的允許、其他各校、亦都如此、</p>
<p>會塲內外警探林立</p>
<p>「五四」紀念日旣然來臨、記者特於是晨前赴北大、一看究竟、首到該校第三院、見那古色古香的門墻前、早巳密佈軍警數十、便衣偵探、亦有十幾名、次到該校第一院、此處之紅樓面前、軍警與便衣偵探、較三院多約一倍、其嚴厲亦更甚、出人完全禁止、最後、才到紀念會場所在的該校第二院、此處門墻前、有騎車警察一大排、的二三十人、全掛盒子砲、向西而立、又有憲兵三四十人、分成三四層、向東而立、對於　門學生、均特別注視、</p>
<p>大禮堂前的荷花池一帶、站有警察甚多、大有五步一哨、十步一崗氣槪、便衣偵探、來往如穿梭、數目總在二三十以上、凡有兩三人站在一處談話的、這些偵探們、一定走過來竚足諦聽、或故意從人們中間跑來跑去、使他們不得不散開來、記者踏入大禮堂時、看到幾個黑禮帽的偵探們、正在講壇之上、大聲念紀念會的對聯、主持紀念會的學生們、不住上前請他們退下講壇、每一請時、他們總是那副愛理不理的神氣、九點鐘、該校當局方面、法學院長周炳琳·課業長樊際昌、同時到場、這時、有十幾個警察走進禮堂將貼在墻上的標語、不分好歹、一律紛紛撕去、只留下一幅布的橫額、和一付布的對聯、橫額上大書「五四十七週年紀念大會」字樣、對聯是「失地　權、今賢於昔、忍聽命寇警、坐令摧殘到底」、「救亡抗敵、死榮乎生、誓獻身民族、力爭解放成功、」</p>
<p>九點正、宣怖開會、有十幾個便衣偵探、混雜在這三四百個學生們裏、一同開會、有人提出組織臨時糾察隊、請便衣偵探們退出會塲、但立刻被周炳琳幾句話打銷了、他說、「這絕對不可能、允許我們開會、已經萬幸了、在這種局面下、我們還有什麼自由可言、而况便衣偵探、隨時隨地總跟着我們的、我們今天光明坦白的開會、怕他們幹嗎呢」、</p>
<p>學生敎授作獅子吼</p>
<p>紀念會節目、非常簡單、只有敎授演說·和同學演說·兩項、算是最精的、這節目單、據說、也是會由學校當局認可、學生們發言的、前後共有三位、這三位的話、有的說、「外面表現、希望不要如內心那麽熱烈而高張、」有的說、「我們無論如何、要在適應環境條件下、努力奮鬥、」說時、揮拳皺眉、他們內心的苦悶、是一望而知的、</p>
<p>後來、主席曾多次請同學上台發表意見、但大家面面相覻、都裹足不前、一向勇於發表意見的北大學生、在這樣環境下、似乎也有點戰戰兢兢了、</p>
<p>敎授們到的不很多、參加的幾位、大概總是臨時得到消息趕來的、發表意見的、一共有馬叙倫·周炳琳·樊際昌·許德珩·會昭倫·等五位、</p>
<p>馬叙倫年在五旬以上、頭髮班白、曾任敎育部次長及浙省民政廳長等要職、爲北大的老敎授、十七年前之「五四」、馬即在該校躬與其事、故所說的話、頗爲親切有味、其主要意思有兩點、　奮鬥要在黑暗裏才有價値、所以十七年前即强調反對學校南遷、　大衆奮鬥求解放的、終久要得到勝利、演說時之姿態、亦莊亦諧、　人入勝、以氏這樣高齡、乃一面在北大授老莊哲舉等課、一面爲國事奔走呼號、不遺餘力、本年一月、此地文化界救國會第一次宣言上、即由氏簽名其首、一時與上海文化界救國會宣言首先簽名之九六叟馬相伯、並爲國人崇仰、</p>
<p>法學院長周炳琳、曾任河北敎育廳長等要職、與黨國關係甚深、並爲某國官憲所嫉視、去年曾遭受數决驅逐及威嚇、而氏屹不爲動、學生運動發生以來、氏一貫以政府立塲發表言論、然因其言辭頗有分寸、故招致反感、尙不甚深、氏之演說於叙述十七年前肄業北大參加「五四」運動之種種回憶後、仍保持其固有立塲、勸學生安心向學、以備將來為國家用、氏之演說、有條有理、短小精悍、一如其人、</p>
<p>課業長樊際昌、站在學校當局地位、勸學生保持熱烈的精神、向有價值的方面求發洩、</p>
<p>曾昭倫之演說、有條不素、不愧化學家本色、氏勸學生做無名英雄、勿盡做有名英雄、</p>
<p>許德珩演說、對於「五四」運動之由來、從新興社會學見地上、加以闡明、並確定「五四」運動意義有三、　爲民衆直接打進政治運動、　爲有組織之運動、　爲普遍的社會運動、並謂現在國際與國內情形、已有很大變動、「五四」運動、在目前已嫌不够、那末、我們將怎樣以「五四」的精神、去進社會運動呢、演說時、擡臂喧呼、口沫飛濺、</p>
<p>十一點半散會、在軍警監視下、大家魚貫出塲、「五四」十七週年紀念會、於是吿終、</p>

<p>海關當局報吿</p>
<p>中央社云、華北走私事件、自本年二月份以來、益見擴大、影響關稅收入、究至若何程度、極爲各方面所欲知其詳、良以我國內外各債、其以關稅收入爲擔保者、爲數極多、是以在日人包庇之下之走私事件、實非尋常局部問題、其影響所及、在政治上、不特涉及中日兩國、抑且與列强均有重大關係、而海關之緝私制度、自廿二年來、改進極速、可與其他各國之緝私制度、互相頡頑、此决若無特殊情形、則走私之禁絕、殆爲極易之事、問題癥結所在、因此允爲顯明、中央社茲據海關當局報吿、關於本項事件之重要點、及數字、的如下述、</p>
<p>去年八月一日至本年四月三十日止、因華北走私事性、而致海關稅收　失、共計達二五·五〇六·十四六元</p>
<p>本年四月份一個月內、關稅收入之損失達八百萬元、</p>
<p>去年八月至本年三月、八個月間、平均每月損失達一百七十萬元、</p>
<p>本年四月一日起、私貨增加之猖獗、爲從來所未有</p>
<p>假定每月損失以八百萬元計、則每年損失將達一萬萬元、合稅收全部幾達三分之一、</p>

<p>本年四月十九至二十五日一星期內、自天津由北寗路平漢路運赴中國其他各處之私貨、約如下述、</p>
<p>海關當局、於昨日發表之報吿中、稱華北走私情形、去年一年、約可分為三個時期、　第一時期、自去年一月至五月底、其時日本及「滿洲國」人民、屢有私運銀幣之事、五月十七日及五月二十五日兩次私運事件、爲當局偵悉、日方即提出要求、致海關方面頗形棘手、在此時期中、海道走私、尙未見擴大、大規模之私運、亦未見成熟、惟　四五月至五月間、銀幣私運頗多、約達一七七·〇〇〇元之譜、　第二時期、自去年六月至九月中旬、其時日方提出耍求、已由我方接受、浸至九月間、海關緝私艦、被迫不能在戰區行使職務、同時沿長城一帶緝私人員、亦被解除武裝、是時走私問題、巳漸見嚴重、海關人員、旣不能携帶手槍、於是不法之徒、乃益見活躍、據的計、是時朝鮮浪人從事走私者、在山海關約有四百人、秦皇島的有　百人、至九月中、乃有專事私運之石河轉運公司出現、中國苦力之被雇者、達一千名之多、於是公開走私、乃即此開始、此等不法之徒、均持有木棒石手手槍等物、海關人員、略有干涉之態度、即被若輩所毆擊、致身受重傷、無可吿訴者、蓋數見不鮮、惟在此時期內、除私運銀幣出口外、所有進口私貨、僅有人造絲一種、由北寗路運赴其他各處、路局方面、迫於武力、惟有任其運送未能反抗、中國方面、數　提請日軍當局協助、而日方則稱、此事應由日警局辦理、及向日警提出要求、則竟稱依照日本法律、向中國走私、並不犯法、故日警殊屬無能爲力、至九月間、形勢益見擴大、是月九日、日軍當局、向秦皇島海關稅務司、耍求將所有海關緝私船隻上所置機關槍一律撤除、雖經海關當局據理力爭、而日方置若罔聞、於是海關迫不得已、惟有屈服、數日後日方又來要求、在戰區日英里以內、所有緝私船隻、不論其武裝或非武裝、一槪不得行駛、中國方面、屈於勢力、有理難伸、於是海關緝私船、乃絕跡於戰區、事聞於外交部、向日本駐華大使數次提出嚴重抗議、絕無結果、　第三時期、自去年九月中至十二月底、在該時期中、海關之緝私管理、可謂巳完全消失、日本海軍當局完全吾認中國三英哩內之領海權、對於　關緝私船之搜查、視爲海盜行爲、以致緝私效力、全部消失、結果、海運無法控制、沿海一帶、自大連而來之私船、絡繹於途、當局對之、惟有興無可如何之歎、今年　月以來、海運之外、又有陸運、海關方面、雖迭請路局及日警協助、然絕無效果、最近冀東僞組織自訂稅率之後、問題乃愈形複雜、日本當局、處處作難、謂貨物一經冀東完稅、即不得再完他稅、可見冀　所定稅率、巳爲日方所許可也、海關報吿又稱、華北走私問題之嚴重、自另一方面觀之、益爲可驚、蓋華北一地、向爲貨物運輸之根據地、所有貨物、自津浦或平漢兩路運輸南下、可以直達揚子江下游各處、中國全部稅收之大宗、均在揚子江北部一帶、現在華北私貨陸續南下、其影響國庫收入、自不僅涉及北方一隅、據去年統計、全年稅收百分之八十八八、均係任秦皇島至寗波一帶之二十一海口所征收、可見華北定私、直接影響全國百分之八十八之收入、其事件之重大、由此可見矣、（未完明日續）</p>

<h3 id="c106">經銷俄油失敗淸償債務　光華公司讓渡亞細亞　將全部淸償上海等四行借欵　機器油池等共售四百餘萬元　——公司名義仍在惟經銷英美油—— <a href="#c106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>本市博物院路十四號華商光華火油股份有限公司、由經理俄商油遍地與英美油商競爭後、致負債茶鉅、該公司爲顧全債務、淸償信譽、忍痛犧牲、讓渡與英商亞細亞火油公司、惟該公司今後之營業、由英美兩國油商供給經銷、茲經大公社記者探得確實可靠消息、分誌如次、</p>
<p>光華歷史　華商光華火油股份有限公司、於民國十七年、由現任我國駐日大使許世英氏等發起、初創時、資本僅五十萬、經理美商美孚火油、行銷各地、營業逐漸發展、於民國十八年、增加資本共爲一百十餘萬、十九年至二十年間由一百五十萬增至三百六十萬、內部營業、分爲火油·汽油·兩部、其油棧設於沛東沿黃浦之老鼠沙及漢口丹水池兩處、該公司董事長爲許世英·常務董事兼總經理經易鬥、該公司在國內具此唯一華商之火油企業、予國人之良好印象、不得不歸功於許世英氏之苦心孤詣、及全體董監事之努力也、</p>
<p>經銷俄油　該公司於民國十七年初創時、原擬作大規模之事業、以期將國內如四川·新疆·等各省大量油產蘊藏、予以開發、無如資本有限、而不能負此重任、故暫時經銷美國之美孚火油、運籌惟折、銳意經營、右三四年中、除去各項開支外、曾盈餘二百五十餘萬、於民國二十年春間、俄油商之UP．T（譯音油遍地）欲在遠東開拓市塲、與英美油商爭一日之長短、無如市塲根基地（即經銷處及儲油池）無着、故再三商諸光華公司協商請設法、將美孚油脫退、改銷俄油、經長時間之磋商、始訂立合同、光華公司即一面脫離經理美油而正式接受俄商經銷俄油云</p>
<p>三國競爭　俄商在華銷油市場問題解决後、即挾其大量之油產、運華傾銷、在民國二十年以前、俄油尙未揷足市場之前、英商之亞細亞美商美孚德士古之油價最高、售價每箱竟售十元以上、俄油初輸華時、每箱爲九元左右、該國油商、欲控制英美油商市場之擴展、故貶價傾銷、最低時每箱僅售叫元六角、銷路突飛猛進、英美油商亦跌價競爭、市場頓呈混亂狀態、誠開油業歷史競爭之創舉、</p>
<p>借欵建設　當此英美俄三國油商在劇烈競爭之時、光華公司、雖係經銷地位、而不負營業上之損失外、惟爲儲藏大量油儲、及運輸輪船機器等、必須有充分準備、故該公司特向上海·大陸·國貨·國華·等四銀行、借欵五百萬元、以地而油池各項作爲抵押品、自借欵成立後、即將原有浦東老鼠沙之油棧擴充外、並在漢口丹水池添建池池、共需費四百五十餘萬元、其借欵契的全數期爲民國二十四年七月爲限、嗣後俄油因競爭虧蝕太鉅、創痛巳深、故與光華解除經理合同、現俄油在遠東市塲、已完全放棄、</p>
<p>國營未成　該公司之所有資本、最後增加至三百六十萬元、嗣後添購機器及建築油池等、又向銀行具借五百萬元、連前經理美油時盈餘二百餘萬、計共一千餘萬元、在三國油商競爭時、前後達三年之久、因此連帶虧蝕二三百萬元、但事實上言之、公司本身、並無虧蝕、而所負者、爲現余變爲各種建設不動產而巳、在困難關頭、曾呈請財實兩部、請予撥借一千萬元救濟、由政府收歸國營、在前實部陳公博部長時、曾派礦業司來滬調査、僉主此項企業應須國家扶助、以免遺落外人、惜因國庫支絀、誠屬心餘力竭、　　未能成爲事實、</p>
<p>讓　英商　該公司但為維持淸償銀行債務信譽計、忍痛犧牲、現除將浦東老鼠沙油地之基地、賣於上海商業儲蓄銀行、計九十六萬元、作爲淸償該銀行債務外、復將機器油池輪船等各項設備、讓渡於英商亞細亞火油公司、計費三百二十餘萬元、業巳雙方簽字、同時美商之美孚火油公司、亦加入爲承受人、與英商亞細亞合作、現光華公司當局已將銀行逾期之債欵、全部消償、</p>
<p>營業照常　據大公社記者向此間英商亞細亞及光華公司雙方面探悉、光華公司雖全　油池等財產讓渡於英商後、但今後該公司營業、悉由英商亞細亞及美孚油商供給、惟其營業、總額不得越過英美兩公司全年全部十分之一即經銷火油數量、不得逾出十萬箱、其經銷佣金部份、尙在洽商中、至其光華名義仍用以對外、而油銷區域、在英美商在華市場根基地、均可營業也、（大公社）</p>

<p>（上海工商業槪況之二十四）</p>
<p>槪述——玻璃製造，我國早有發明，惟皆手工生產，技術甚為落後。清光緒二十九年，蘇人張季直，許九香等，曾集資八十三萬兩，創辦近代化之耀徐玻璃廠於江北，但因經騐缺乏，不善經營，至宣統二年即告停頓。上海之有玻璃工廠，略較耀徐為遲，惟迄今亦已有二十餘年之歷史。仁和玻璃廠創設於民國元年，民國四年國人又收買日人之中華玻璃廠，改為中華鳳記玻璃廠，民九民十，公益玻璃廠與上海玻璃有限公司繼起，嗣後接踵而起者有浦東第一玻璃廠，協昌玻璃廠，光明製造電器有限公司，同和玻璃廠等。至民國十六七年，該業大興，共計有三十餘家，民十八年後，因金貴銀賤之影響，該業稍受挫折，滬戰時更受嚴重打擊，計被焚者即有仁和，中華鳳記，上海等數家。戰事結束以後，該業又露生氣，新起者有　業，晶華，中央化學等廠，規模皆相當可觀。此上海玻璃業沿革之大槪也。</p>
<p>至玻璃製品種類，本極繁多，大別之有平板玻璃，光學玻璃，及化學用玻璃器，及裝飾用玻璃等。惟上海各玻璃廠，上半皆因資本不甚充足，技術亦欠精密，其產品什九仍為料器，而尤以瓶，杯，缸，燈等日常用品為多。至平板玻璃，目下僅耀華一家製造。故我國對於該項平板玻璃，仍須仰賴舶來品之供給，此我人所應區別者也。</p>
<p>製造玻璃及料器之主要原料為玻璃砂，硝石，石灰，熒石，錳粉，洋碱，硫酸等物。本埠各廠所需者主要皆來自內地或外洋，如玻璃砂，石灰，熒石等礦料，可由本國內地供給，至錳粉則有賴於日人，洋碱則多係英商下內門出品，是項化學工業原料，國人尙難獨立。故就玻璃業而言，國人尙須努力者，為增加產量，以北洋貨之輸入，更進而求化學工業原料之自給，蓋如是方能謀民族玻璃業之蒸蒸日上也。</p>
<p>洋玻璃之進口——我國市場上所需之玻璃製品，尙需仰賴洋貨之輸入，前已言之，今再就其進口數量，種類，及來源，逐一記述，以供國人參。</p>
<p>舶來之玻璃產品，種類極多，其中最佔大宗者，為普通窗玻璃片。至各項玻璃之進口口岸，自以上海為最多，約佔全國進口量百分之六十以上，今根據海關報告，將最近三年數字列表於后（單位一千海關金單位：）</p>
<p>若按國別而言，輸入最多者為捷克斯拉夫，德國，比利時等國。此中特別值得介紹者為捷克。捷克為歐洲一小國，國人向不注意，但其玻璃及玻璃製品在我國却頗滸。據捷克本國之統計，其輸入我國之玻璃製器，一九三〇年為六·〇八五千克郎（捷幣名），一九三四仍能維持七·一二八千克郎，不隨中國一般進口貿易之萎縮而減退，尤足見其暢銷境況。陳列於上海各大商舖，光耀奪國之“Inwald”商標玻璃器皿，即為捷克出品。再如百樂門跳舞廳及國際飯店之玻璃什具，亦皆來自捷克，由是可見捷克玻璃產品對於上海工商業實有密切之關係。</p>
<p>上海主要各廠之近況——據申報年鑑）二十四年份）統計，我國玻璃製造廠共有七十八家，上海佔三十一家，資本全國為三·〇一九·〇〇〇元，上海佔六〇七·〇〇〇元，產品全國為四·九九二·〇〇〇，上海佔三·二一〇·〇〇〇。上海三十一廠中，資本在一萬元以上者十八家，其餘十三家之資格僅在千元以上，今將主要各廠（製玻璃器皿者）情形分述於后：</p>
<p>一·中央化學玻璃廠——該廠係前瑞和坩堝廠廠長徐新之等所組織，二十三年八月成立，資本收足五萬元，設廠於平涼路一三三二號，廠屋佔地二畝八分，係租地造屋，廠內建有大爐灶一只，設備新式，雇用工人五十餘名。發行所原在華萼坊，今春因營業發展，不敷應用，遷至三馬路五六六號。其出品以各種醫藥用及化學用之玻璃器具為主，家用器皿輔之。該廠以出品精良，銷路甚廣，幾有不克應付之慨。去年營業總額達十萬餘元，今後或能再增半倍</p>
<p>二·中華玻璃廠——該廠係鄭鍾漢獨資經營，資本三萬元，於民國二十一年七月設立，廠址在塘山路九五七號，專製各種瓶類及各種玻璃用品，該廠廠屋及基地均係已產，內建燒　三只，造價約三四千元，各種瓶類鋼模約值二萬五六千元，該廠營業以本埠為主，各化妝品製造廠，糖菓廠及製酒廠，業有聯絡，故其營業頗佳，去年營業額達十八萬元，計獲利二萬元，（未完）</p>

<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>只有發展國產　昭蘇民族工業</p>
<p>誰也知道，中國當前是正過著一個最嚴重的國難時代，而尤其是經濟的國難，由於歷年來外貨的傾銷，入超的激增，每年巨額漏巵的滾滾輸出，以致農村破產，工商凋弊，不景氣的潮流，吹盪全國，大多數人民購買力的薄弱，更趨極點，整個國民經濟的崩潰，已走入了最後的階段，而怎樣打開經濟的國難，已成了當前工們最迫切最緊要的問題，全國人民今後的生路也實在是只有繫於經濟國難的打開。</p>
<p>可是，痛心的事實告訴我們，到最近為止，「經濟的國難」，却並不因我們國民生計的日趨衰微，而稍有鬆馳，相反地在最近卻因外來勢力的加緊侵略，而益趨嚴重，像華北，華南走私問題的猖獗，西北市塲自公路完成後，國貨界正欲有所發展，卻被外貨捷足先登，大肆傾銷，使國貨工業的銷路，大受影響，尤其是私貨到處，國貨不但在那邊無立足餘地，並且還影響到客帳的難收，存貨的退還等，簡直鞭打得國貨界無路可走。</p>
<p>因此，我們可以知道，要打開經濟的國難，那只有發展國產，而發展國產的具體進行，決不是空洞的吶喊所能收效，卻必須要有清經濟國難的眞相，和它的造成主因，然後我們對症發藥，掃除阻止國貨進展的障礙，尤其要嚴防走私，驅逐種種外來的經濟壓迫，一切主權獨立，那纔能打開了經濟的國難，和解決了國貨發展的問題。</p>
<p>所以我們必須認清了目下整個工商界的發展和繁榮，是都被經濟的國難，桎梏住了，束縛住了，而我們今後的出路，必須要掙脫這束縛，解除這桎梏，纔可恢復我們經濟的自由發展。</p>
<p>目前我們經濟的國難，誠然是嚴重的。但我們千萬不要悲觀，不要灰心，我們要求民族的生存，所以必須要打開經濟的國難，而打開經濟的國難，那必須要發展國產，昭蘇民族工業，合政府與人民之力，上下團結一致，共同進行，以謀達到我們最後的目的和勝利。</p>

<h3 id="c143">婦女界與國貨之因緣 <a href="#c143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>日前本市國貨運動聯合會，招待上海婦女會諸女士，頗得婦女界領袖之熱烈贊助，是日各報紀載，微有出入，記者參與招待之役，席間談話，極為圓滿。敢述婦女界之意見，與記者之期望，以為關心國貨事業之同志告焉：</p>
<p>婦女界諸領袖之意見，認為年來國貨之進步，極可欽佩。婦女界衣食住用之所需，茍可以採用國貨之處，無不儘量採用。且謂各人衣著，已一致服用國產綢緞，言次舉衣相示，美亞蔡君聲白在座，騐之果然。又謂小孩服裝，均用國產布疋，三友鴻新，為其大宗主顧，且言兒童愛國，出自天笥，復受敎育薰陶之力，家長偶一大意，購用非國貨之綢布，輙向家長聲明不願穿著，卽此一點，中國前途　大有希望。　華　夫人之一番演說，勗勉國貨廠商，努力改進出品，務使婦女界衣食住所用之物品，一惟國貨是賴。並希望自出心裁，保存中華固有之美，勿競爭洋化，模倣不相干之花樣，語重心長，尤為國貨界所拳拳服膺。記者於此，輙生感想有三：</p>
<p>一般婦女界已轉移風氣，一致傾向於購用國貨，故凡以國貨公司號召者，必門庭若市，此為十年來提倡國貨之效果，良足自慰。</p>
<p>兒童愛用國貨之心，自家庭敎育力量之外，加以學校敎育之力量，其勢益大且強，此輩長而為主人主婦，其服用國貨之熱烈，誠有沛然莫之能禦之勢。</p>
<p>國貨界是製造者，婦女界是服用者，製造與服用兩方，能開誠布公，時時接洽，造成沆瀣一氣之風氣，常常交換意見，溝通情誼，此後國貨界之發展，更不可以言語形容。</p>
<p>凡事能相見以誠，相談以眞摯，則任何隔閡，可以掃除。婦女界旣能眞心贊助國貨，提倡國貨如此，則卽有一二點，意識之相差，或間接者之誤會，萬勿心存芥蒂，致灰一片熱烈之心。記者昨晤李振華王瑞竹歐陽駿諸女士，盛言婦女界提倡國貨之切要，正在聯合女同志一致起來，從事婦女界服用國貨運動。各方存同一之心理，感同一之需要，雖方法不一，而殊途同歸，一以發展國貨消滅入超為職志，此則國貨界極好之氣象也。</p>

<p>五月七日，黨國旗製銷總局，招待各界赴上海印染廠參觀國黨旗之製造。余以徐君采丞任君矜蘋之招，赴廠參觀，計歷二小時，始周遍紡織染整之工作。是廠計分五部：　為紡部，即將棉花紡成棉紗之部分，有和花，拆包，輸棉，開棉，清花，梳棉，抽棉，粗紡，細紡等機，豐田式紡車，有五十二架，一萬五千錠。規模甚偉大。　為織部，即將棉紗織成紗布的部分，織布機均屬豐田式，效能極高，每日可出布三千餘疋。　為漂煉部，將紗布漂白，計有漂煉機十餘架，極精美耐用。　為染部，即將漂白紗布，先染底色。　為印部，將染就之布，正式印成黨國旗顏色，然後用蒸汽水洗滌乾凈，再用整理工夫，色艷鮮明，布疋平整。是廠所有原料，除一部分顏料外，其他悉用國貨原料。徐君於紡織事業，富有經騐，逐一指示，於絡紗，整紗，漿紗，上軸，穿棕，穿扣，捲緯等工作，指點尤詳。印部設備，更見匠心。紡機部分，據徐君云，豐田紡紗機之效能，較美機增百分之三十，較英機增百分之十，日本人已由仿造而進為創造，於此可信。工人約達一千三百人，極有精神。在十小時內，可印黨國旗一萬五千碼。每日生產，如係一號至三號旗，可二十萬面，如四號旗可八萬面。如五六號旗則在一萬面以上。七八九十四種之旗，則均在數千面左右，所用機器，旣屬效能最迅捷者，故生產特多，管理靈便。統計每一黨國旗之成功，自棉花起，以迄飄展於空中，其製造過程，經過手續四十六次。張君子廉謂此項黨國旗，有三特點：　永不退色，　整塊幅面，　國貨原料。同人參觀一過，極為滿意，因濡筆記之。</p>

<p>— 孫麟昌</p>
<p>桐油為我國之特產，有川桐，徵桐，浙桐等名稱，各依產地而區別其種類，國人多以之潤飾房屋器具及塗漆船舶之用。因桐油功能抵抗雨打水滲，一般船隻，終年寢　水中，若無桐油塗漆保護，極易腐朽。至於輸往國外，在昔多用於工物品，嗣後在軍用品中亦占重要地位。如飛機，潛水艇等之外表，均須潤以桐洞，方稱堅固。不料年來外人對於此物在軍事上又發明一特殊用途。因兵士作前綫每次槍彈發出後。其槍管即行發熱，欲繼續運用，以頃刻間熱氣未退，影響射擊，如以桐洞搽之，可免此患。近來世界風雲日趨緊張，各國備戰甚亟。故我國桐油之輸出激增，最近兩日，且佔出口貨物之首位也。</p>

<p>中央社）據新自東北入關之旅客、談及偽組織統治下之東北敎育槪况、茲分誌如下、</p>
<p>敎育行政及學校組織</p>
<p>偽組織最高敎育行政機關、為文敎部設總次長各一人、分設總務學務禮敎三司總務學務為司長、以某國人充之、總務司下設秘書調查庶務文書四科、學務司分設專門普通兩科、禮敎司而設社會敎育及宗敎為科外、有編審委員會及督學官各省敎育廳設廳長一人、以下分設總務科學務科禮敎科督學科、為將學務科、分為學校敎育及社會敎育兩科者、總務學務督學三科科長、以某國人充之、督學及科員、某國人華人參半、各中等學校設校長一人、敎務訓育事務衛生圖書舍務學級等主任各一人、敎務事務為主任、以某國人充之、最近訓育主任亦多由某國人充當各實騐中學校長、亦為某國人各小學添設副校長一人、以某國人充之、</p>
<p>敎育廳對各校、凡有重要訓示、即由某國籍科長、召集各校某籍主任面授機宜、各校校對敎育廳有所請示、亦由某籍主任逕商之某籍科長廳長校長簽字蓋章而巳、關係機密之件、並簽押手續亦無之文敎部敎育廳間之關係、亦如是各校所有用品、悉由敎育廳發放各校職敎員之進退、亦由敎育廳決定、</p>
<p>敎育宗旨</p>
<p>偽組織敎育宗旨、在南校為「忠君退讓、」在女校為賢母良妻、至明瞭建國精神、實現王道主義、偽滿與某國親善、共存共榮、則為男女各校所共同、</p>
<p>各級學校</p>
<p>根據上述敎育宗旨舊日東北各專科以上學校、當然在取消之列、並裁併中學及示範學校、對職　學校、則加以整頓、俾一般東北靑年之最高理想、即為養成最下層之技衛人才、　幼稚園及小學、則積極擴充、蓋灌　親某國思想而奴化之、以自幼稚園小學入手為最澈底之辦法、各級學校取消公民黨義、而代以修身、减少英語算學鐘點、而添授某國語、某國語不及格、不得升級、畢業中等學校史地課本、均用新編之偽國歷史、偽國地理、其他科目沿用舊日敎本、而加以刪節塗改、各小學敎科書、現均用新編者、各校某國語、悉由某國人担任講授、敎育廳並聘各科某國籍敎員多名、分任各縣立指導員、各級學校的訓育、除高唱偽滿與某國親善、共存共榮王道樂士建國眞諦外、並施行下列訓練方法、（甲）唱國歌拜皇城、每月晨操時、先聲偽國國旗、師生齊唱偽國國歌、並遙拜偽國皇城、（乙）參御影讀詔書各校禮堂、　懸掛溥逆照片、尊稱曰「御影」、並珍藏「詔書」兩種、一為登極詔書、一為訪某回　詔書、其內容則為「偽滿與某國不可分離」之金科玉律諭、所有臣民澈底了解遵旨奉行、凡舉行重要典禮、或開會必先向御影敬禮、並朗讀「詔書」、（丙）寫詔書競賽會、為喚起學生、對詔書之注意、舉行全「滿」學生、寫詔書競賽會、每校各選十名、赴省城參加初賽、結果每校各選兩名、赴「新京」參加決賽、（丁）組織建國宣傳班及宣撫班、為親善共存共榮等理論、普及偽「滿」深入人心起見、組織建國宣傳班及宣撫班、分赴各地各校講演王道主義、協和政策、及偽滿與某國不可分離制要義、（戊）尊孔、凡有文廟之省縣、對文廟力加修葺、無文廟者、倡議修建、利用孔子大同主義、及君君臣臣等說、以誘惑靑年、使效忠傀儡組織、（已）徵求宣傳國情繪畫、為使一般民眾明瞭、偽組織政情、並助長其對偽國意識起見、偽吉林敎育廳、於去秋通飭師屬各學校員生、徵集宣傳國情繪畫、</p>
<p>留學政策</p>
<p>對九一八以前出國之東北籍留學、歐美公費生、由駐在國某國使領補發學費、並勸令歸國、聽從者則發給歸國旅費、否則停止學費供給、以後即不送歐美留學生、凡欲深造這、只准赴某國就學、留某國考試、分下列數種、（甲）選送中等學校敎員留學　間一年、每月津貼六十元、（乙）選送高中畢業生、每月學費自二十元至五十元、視所入學校只等級及所載地面定、（丙）選送初中學生偽駐某國大使丁士源、以年事稍長之學生思想堅定不易同化、有碍偽滿與某國恊和工作、爰建議選送十五歲以下之學生、赴某國留學、此項主張、當蒙採納、故近來留學某國之關外學生、不乏十五歲左右者、月給學費廿元至廿五元、（丁）選派小學教員、分批赴某國參觀遊歷廳訓、以增厚親某國思想、而便效忠於奴化敎育、（戊）勒令偽官吏子弟、赴某國就學、為統制留某國東北籍學生起見、裁撤舊日各省經理員、而於駐某國偽大使館內、增設學務科、專司留學生事宜、以某國大充科長、並利用關東洲、（旅　大連）及南滿醫費南滿公學等校出身之學生、組織團體、如靑年團、瀋水會同窗會、同鄕會等、以聯絡感情為名、監視各生行動、不使與內地省籍之留學生往來、</p>
<p>限制入關學生</p>

<p>— （蘊素）</p>
<p>你如果陷在鐵網重重的牢獄裏，你就不應該垂頭喪氣，涕淚縱橫；更不應該希冀他人來援助你，救濟你，你應該憑藉自己的力量，和遇　的惡魔奮鬥，示威，宣戰，將全身的鎖鍊　　，解脫一空，恢復以往的自由，獲得人生的幸福，不然，你的苦痛是永遠不會消滅的。</p>
<p>無論什麽人的生活，總要起一點波瀾好。不問是快樂的，痛苦的；幸福的，悲慘的；勝利的，失敗的。總比那庸庸碌碌，無聲無奧，平凡地過去的好得多。這好比飲那紅灔灔的葡萄酒，和黑辣辣的苦水，究竟比喝那白開水勝一籌。</p>
<p>戀愛它能給人以無限的幸福，也能給人以無限的創傷。不過戀愛的滋味，絕非個個人能嘗試得到的，也非個個人能領略得到的。因爲你雖親近它，愛慕它，它却拒你於千里之外，不和你發生一些熱情，那你也無可奈何它。我以爲年靑的朋友們，不如將這顆赤裸裸的心，整個的獻給文藝。因爲你祇要愛上了它，它絕不會拒絕你的，挪揄你的，它至少能給你一點安慰，一點甜蜜。</p>

<p>黃昏的七點至八點之間，大商店窗外的年虹燈光，紅的，藍的，交相輝映着。在這强烈的年虹燈光下，映演出了一個十字路口的一切動態，那是都市一角中的一個橫斷面。</p>
<p>紅的警燈，換上了綠色的，擠塞在南北路口的汽車，便雄糾糾的向前衝去。有大屁股的，有塌鼻頭的，有舊式的立體形的，有新式的流綫型的。載着的，自然是紳士和高貴的娘兒們。但是在這些汽車之後，却有不自量力的黃包車夫，沒命的向前追着，似乎想要和汽車比賽着速率。——不，這是他們在奔走着他們的生活素。他們的臂膀上，老是帶着斜坐在車廂裏，裝着閒適的姿勢的準紳士，像牛馬一樣的奔着。</p>
<p>南北路上的電車，也懶懶地向前爬動着了。行人，也在這當兒，向前奔着，而越過馬路去。老上海們，總是那麼閒適地踱着，是那麽鎮靜。這時，在東西路口上的紅色警燈下面，又停止着蛇頭一般的電車，吐出了一大批男的，女的，老的，少的搭客，同時，又吞進了一大批。站台上，便跟着起了一陣的騷動，賣夜報的孩子，直着沙啞的嗓子，呌嚷着。乞丐們，裝着勉强的笑臉，追逐着行人。臉上塗着紅脂白粉，身上裹着紅綠旗袍的賣淫的女人，不住地用媚眼，掃射着行人。流氓們，跟着恣情地調笑。小癟三們，把眼死釘在車上某客上絲絨帽，正在盤算着來一下子「拋頂宮」。一切，都呈着極度的活躍。</p>
<p>路口的巡捕，噓噓地吹着哨子，警燈的顏色換了，電車，汽車，黃包車，步行者，又在東西路上交馳着。騷動，又在南北路口演出着。車，——人，——車，——，不絕地在東西路上，南北路上來往着，老是那麼的擠着，攘着，但是沿街的大商店中的伙友們，却只是籠着袖兒閒眺着，雖然年虹燈光，紅的，藍的，不住地在窗外輝映着。</p>

<p>第一回　品茗作淸談夜窗聽雨　折枝驚艷影花巷流芳</p>

<h3 id="c192">日本的公園 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>都市人們的煩悶生活中，最理想的安慰便是公　。我國人　　獨樂　私人　　　多。故各國公園都較我國爲普及。日本東京附近已有公園十餘處，兒童公園更多。去年某小學校的棒球隊，被　車輾死五六人，大受輿論的攻擊，於是今歲將建築百五十七處的小公園，供兒童的遊玩休息。日本小孩子，放學回家，書包向家裏一丟，早已又到了街上和小公園去了。五六歲的小孩，也常由父母哥姊伴着在沙池裏堆沙。小公園裏只有樹木，花卉很少。中間都是鐵製的運動器械，所以名爲兒童公園，不　爲兒眞得運東　　巳。</p>
<p>日本從前的廟宇神社，都有很大的面積。種着樹木和櫻花，佈置成庭園的樣于。較大的有五重塔石燈籠石牌樓等建築物。原來是供參拜的遊散之用，後來改造擴大之後，便成公園。所以初到日本的外國人，看見日本的公園裏，都有廟宇，莫不懷疑的。</p>
<p>東京芝公園，便是將增上寺改造而成的，佈置和我國的庭園相似也是飛泉懸瀑地爲池，疊石爲阜，有山林的生趣，是日本舊式的庭園佈置法。此種公園，幽靜曲折，當天燃氣，但不為一段　人所　，故遊人甚稀。我國新建公園，亦都傾向於歐化，多草地花壇，洋式建物。日本人亦然，如日比谷上野公園等，都巳脫離了日本固有的中國式造園法了。實際上我國造園法別有一逸趣</p>
<p>日本公園裏常附有釣魚池，划船，運動場，演講廳，圖書館等。旣可有些收入，供擴充維持之用。遊人於散步之外，又可以得共他的運動或娛樂。上野公園裏尙有科學館博物館動物園等，利用公園，灌輸民衆知識，法至良善。各公園每月都有各種展覽，如園藝，盆栽，玩具，小動物等，很能吸引觀衆，引起同好。我國公園裹，均有茶館，二三親友，品茶閑談，亦可得一日淸福。日本公園裏面，大都不能營商，附近的小販是很多的。因此來公園的遊客，當帶着水壺便當，作野外聚餐。以致滿　紙屑，果殼狼籍，每天要幾卡車才能運完。</p>
<p>利用天然，是日本建造公園的特長，凡是湖畔山谷，郊外森林，均闢成公園。用極低廉的高架電車連絡着。每年春秋兩季，不但電車的營業大增。而公園附近的人民，販買土產，亦獲利不少。我國各地如能將風景區略事整理，用便利之交通連絡之，以供遊覽，想都市人民可以多一個機會和農村接觸，警惕自己。而農村土產，亦可因此振興起來。</p>

<p>— 周笑涵</p>
<p>手淫惡癖。已成爲靑年公開之秘密。不　男子犯之。卽女子亦染焉。</p>
<p>夫手淫自凟。旦旦而伐。其輸精管形成鬆弛。最易引起遺精夢洩等症。不惟精元頻耗。腦髓蒙損。且生機摧毀。疾患叢生。</p>
<p>精爲人身之至寶。直接爲子嗣所關。間接能營養腦髓及全身。故凡犯手淫或罹遺洩者。精旣枯薄。腦亦衰弱。而肌肉消瘦。精神萎靡。康健喪失。病變百出。</p>
<p>治療之法。手淫切戒。注重攝生。內服「希米脫氏固精片」以治遺洩。精關旣固。始克節流。並服「生殖素」以補其虧損。生機重榮。乃可開源。余於今春曾治愈學子馮翰章。工友金紹康。職員楊迪榮等輩之遺精夢洩諸症。咸奏最美滿之特效云。</p>

<p>治法培補除毒並重</p>
<p>腎臟司淸血除毒之職。如腎虧者。不惟身體瘦弱。生機喪失。且血液內之「尿强酸質」無由加以相當之排除。遂結成「尿强酸晶」。其形有如碎玻璃屑。在身體各部作祟。遂發生腰背骨筋絡酸痛等症。寖假而動脈形成硬化。易罹中風之患。</p>
<p>「强斯登氏骨痛片」。功能化除尿酸。搜除餘毒。祛除風濕。防止動脈硬化及中風之患。故爲統治腰背骨節筋絡酸痛無上良劑。凡患手足麻木不仁。及半身不遂。全身瘓癱者。服之允效。</p>
<p>但如因身體虧弱而致腰背酸痛者。則宜服「生殖素」。余曾於冬初以「女用生殖素」及「强斯登氏骨痛片」治愈張獻廷夫人之腰酸骨痛。其明證也。</p>

<h3 id="c207">失業者的飢餓隊 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>近來世界時常發見一種新團體，那就是一般失業者所組織「飢餓隊」。前些時候，英國有一部分工人，看到當局一面把從人民身上挖取得來的大宗金錢，用作製造殺人利器之需，一面呌一大羣無以謀生的人，忍耐餓肚，故大家就組織一個飢餓隊，向玫府請願說：「我們要求麵包，而不需要戰艦」。最近美國紐遮西州，亦有失業者二十七萬人，組織一個同樣的團體，前往托倫頓，並有千餘人，盤踞立法院內外，聲稱必俟立法院籌定救濟費後，才可退出。</p>
<p>現在世界各國，皆蹈於經濟恐慌的境地。社會上失業者的有增無减，已成爲一個嚴重的問題。但是各國之窮，果眞巳窮到連給人民吃飯的能力亦沒有嗎？怕不至於這樣吧。別的不說，大量的軍費付得出，難道人民的衣食生活，就不能維持，像英國工人的要求，是不錯的？「我們耍求麵包，而不需要戰艦」。只有麵包，才能解决失業者的飢餓，戰艦反會增重他們的痛苦。美國工人的申請當局籌畫救濟費，亦是一個正當的要求。</p>
<p>我國的情形，又是怎樣呢？飢餓隊的組織，是還未發見過的。然而近來各地，時常发生貧人搶取食物，及農民閙荒的事情。這比飢餓隊的結隊請願。性質還要嚴重。上一個月，蘇州就發生過一回農婦閙荒的風潮，置正是一般農民生活困苦的反映。最近上海仁濟醫院，發表一個報告說：「去年上海貧民之數驟增，一半固然因為無工可做，而大多數還是從飢餓的地方流落來的」。這亦足見目前我國人民的生活狀况，是已比往時更爲艱難。</p>
<p>失業者飢餓隊的組織，這顯然是表示一般人民生活的極度困頓。這一個團體的力量，是强大的。當局要是沒有相當的救濟辦法，社會的安寗，怕要無法維持，吃飯的權利，是人人應有的。可是現在的世界，却有一大羣人，是陷於餓飢綫上，求生不得。欲活不能，這現象是多麽的危險呵。</p>
<h3 id="c208">最後一課 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— 凌冰</p>
<p>「先生，不耍講書……」</p>
<p>「講時事呀，先生……」</p>
<p>我踏進課堂，還沒翻開公民課本的時侯，三十多個孩子就像一羣小麻雀似的嚷成一片。我裝出怪威嚴的神色，右手在講檯上重重一拍，吆喝一聲：</p>
<p>「不要鬧；」</p>
<p>孩子們立刻靜下來了，無數烏黑的眼珠子不住地對着我溜，顯然在熱切地等待我講時事。</p>
<p>「今天要講書，……本學期書敎不</p>
<p>課堂裏又像滾湯似的沸騰起來，幾十張小嘴執抝地送出一致的要求：「講時事呀，先生！」當一個孩子默默地掀開書桌的蓋板，掏出公民課本攤在面前的時候，前後左右的目光一齊向他身上注射，許多嘴巴還發出嗤嗤的噓聲，使他不得不紅着臉把課本塞回原處。</p>
<p>我噗嗤地笑了一聲，但這笑却比哭還痛苦。</p>
<p>「那末講幾個有趣的故事給你們聽吧。」</p>
<p>「不，先生。我們要聽時事呀！」</p>
<p>我無奈地呆立在講檯的後跟，不住地乾咳着，說不出一句話。</p>
<p>爲了孩子們熱烈的要求，我根據報紙上的材料對他們講了幾回時事，不料竟因此而受到校長嚴重的警吿。他說校外有人說我老在課室裏宣傳什麽，他誠懇地要求我此後千萬別再講什麽時事了，爲了學校，爲了他的地位。我點頭，苦笑，沒回一句話。我在內疚的慘痛中編造了幾個有趣的故事，預備在不得已時用這些故事代替時事。可是目前的事實證明我這番欺騙孩子的苦心是白費了，我還有什麽話說呢？</p>
<p>「黃先生，你眞是太那個了，隨他們這樣胡鬧。」校長突然踏進課堂，聳起眉尖對着我說。他隨後身子轉了一個半圈，臉孔一扳，對孩子們　喝道：</p>
<p>「這是公民課還是時事課？唉！………黃先生客氣一點，你們就可以無法無天地胡鬧嗎？快拿出課本來。」</p>
<p>課堂裏立刻起了小騷動，在開合着檯板的噼噗聲和翻動書頁的悉索聲中，還夾雜着糢糊的咆哮聲，這使得校長的怒火重又噴發起來。</p>
<p>「誰說什麼？」兩雙眼睛閃電似的在孩子們的臉上掃。</p>
<p>墳墓般的靜寂。校長憤憤地給他們瞪了幾眼，默默地走了開去</p>
<p>我想說什麼，但又說不出來，只感覺到自己的嘴唇抖動得很利害。我抓起書本，瞥一眼面前的孩子們，他們正如一羣可憐的羔羊在無形的壓力下機械地釘視着面前的書本，他們緊皺的眉頭顯出一種敢怒而不敢言的無奈的隱痛。我的心像被無數針尖刺着一樣難受。</p>
<p>我勉强讀完了一段書，該是講解的時候了，但不知怎的總是講不出來，像被什麽緊緊扼住喉嚨以的。爲了二十元月薪的代價，我居然出賣了自己的靈魂，不惜用勝過砒霜的毒汁硬注進無罪的孩子們的脈管，這是應該的嗎？</p>
<p>我突然牙齒一咬，把課本往檯上一丟，大聲喊道：「大家合上書本，聽我講時事吧！」</p>
<p>孩子們不的而同地全身一震，抬起頭，睜着驚異的眼睛，像在問：「你發瘋了嗎，先生？」</p>
<p>「不過吿訢你們：這是我最後一課了。」於是我就大胆地高聲地講着本週的時事……</p>
<p>第二天早晨，我跟着行李踏出校門的時候，一羣孩子就來包圍着我，七嘴八舌地問我爲什麽要離開學校。</p>
<p>『你們忘掉我昨天的話嗎？「這是我最後一課了。」』我苦笑地答。</p>

<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>心裏想：在這保障嚴密的城廓里，總可安穩的睏牠一個大夜吧？</p>
<p>重量的石頭從心架上落下去。我和老鐵三個人是住在東首的後間，牆，眞白，沒有一點汚痕，牠在告訴着旅客們這棧房是新的，還沒有經過什麽糟塌吶</p>
<p>把晚　打發進了肚子，街上，吹蕩着一陣爽人的凉風，由於經歷的常情，我們意會到夜里的天色會變動的。管牠，我們三個人走在中心的路上，店，擺設，什麽都給了我們一種新奇的發覺。</p>
<p>走，進去，阿黃指着右邊的一個店子：聽他二段書再回去。</p>
<p>山國里的情形，阿黃很熟悉，那裏出產什麽，價錢怎樣的，他都知道。書塲，有一統間長長的屋子，兩面，排着許多用帆布製成的躺椅，中問，還有一個不很靈巧的茶几，屋心，留一條狹長的走道，油燈就弔在那走道的頂上，除了這些以外，只有另一頭的書台和牆板上的幾付對聯了。</p>
<p>許是天早吧，除了我們以外，不看</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>見有第四個顧主，怪凄淸的。那年老的茶房嗞着一嘴的黃牙，張張奇特的眼神看看我們幾下，也許眼色里另有語言，又有誰知道。等着，等着，半個鐘頭溜過去，雨，浙：地落了，書台，依然的寂寞着。至什麽時候才能聽得到書呢？不願意再繼續的挨下去，迎了念驟的風雨走回了歸途。</p>
<p>快睡的時候，老伕頭提了一盞風燈趕到這面來，雨水，掛上了他那花白的鬍子，氣喘着，褪了光芒的眼睛望着每一個人，不用說什麽，就能知道他存在了一種希冀。</p>
<p>—我說黃先生，他沒有敢直接的說下去，笑了，明天我也搭了車子吧？</p>
<p>—搭車，要龍洋五塊。老黃也笑起來。</p>
<p>無論從那方面講，我們都沒有反對的理由，何况整個的車子，又是包就就的呢！老伕頭忽忙的去了。夜，吞併了全部空間，大地是靜的。</p>
<p>由桐梓到遵義，這一段路程並不很遠，的計着只有一百二三十里的樣子，假使長途汽車的速率快些的話，那，只須要三個鐘頭就可以到達的。</p>
<p>頂着晨曦的陰臉，我們把應有的物件，搬運到公司的汽車站上，所謂汽車站，是並沒有什麽月台的，僅僅地在公　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　在我們的想像里，以爲山國里的汽車，那破敗的程度也就很可以的，然而，車子終於和我們見面了，牌子是福特的出品，式樣雖不怎樣的新頴，倒還過得去，如果要比擬的話，是有些像上海的滬閔長途汽車的。</p>
<p>司機的人年紀很輕，他能說上海的方言，也能講流利的國語，並且，還懂得廣東的行話。眞的，遠地的旅客，假使能遇到近鄉的人會比自己的親族還要親近的。我們的談話很投機，融洽打開了那生疏的板壁，他吿訴我們到這里工作的年限和景况，這社會的動態和風土人情；談着，談着，不讓虛僞有絲毫的逗留。不知怎樣一來，把話題轉到了將來的出路，他的臉沉下來，搖了搖頭，深深的嘆了兩口氣。</p>
<p>這，給了我們一種暗示，山國？那里面的生活，畢竟也不是容易的啊！</p>
<p>老伕頭慌張的趕來，除了那一根手杖以外，還多了一件煤油的鐵箱，他把這兩件寳物放上了車子，也幫同着綑紮，安置，小件的放在車里，長件的綑在車頂和旁邊。</p>
<p>車子，在人們的圍觀里，衝出了城，像隻猛虎，急驟的奔上那看不到頭的公路。</p>
<h3 id="c210">燈下 <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— 馬均</p>
<p>跳下黃包車，付了車錢，彷彿逃脫一個惡魔似的他急速地逃進了弄堂。在自己門前站定的時候，他來不及按門鈴，就掏出鑰匙開門進去了。跨進客堂，掛鐘剛鏜鏜敲着九下，他才安心地舒了一口氣，在桌上烟罐里抽了支烟捲，用打火機燃着跑上樓去。在半樓梯遇見妻從電話間里出來，但是她彷彿沒有瞧見他似的逕自上樓回房去了。於是他一個箭步冲上去，喊着：</p>
<p>「快些走罷，已經九點鐘了。」</p>
<p>妻是綳緊着臉，已經坐在沙發里了。見到這情形，他在房門口放慢了脚步，緩緩地踱到妻跟前，像每一個好丈夫那樣柔和地拍着妻的肩頭說：「不是還來得及嗎？生什麽氣呢？」</p>
<p>妻向他撇了一下嘴唇，把面孔轉向丈夫相反的方向，像獨自私語似的：。「六點鐘出寫字間的，到這時候回來。」</p>
<p>明白了這點，丈夫輕鬆地聳着肩頭，坐到沙發的手靠上，故意油滑地面對着妻的臉，低聲下氣的說：</p>
<p>「我們先去看戲，停會吿訴你，公司里的事忙哩。」就抓着妻的膀子想拉她起來，但是妻憤怒地摔了他的手，把自己的身體投到沙發的另一角落里，注覦着窗外，窗外是一片沒有月亮的黑暗的天幕</p>
<p>丈夫站起身来，把烟尾向窗外抛去，搓搓手，像公司里遇到困雖的情形的候一樣。他沿着桌子走圈子，皮鞋嘰嘰地嚮着，但是他擔不起用最簡單的話向妻解釋遲回來的原因，那　結里結巴的事幾乎把他的腦子都弄昏了，「你們女人家知道些什麽呢」他不由地脫口說了</p>
<p>妻馬上從沙發角落里翻過身來，重覆着他的話「你們女人家知道些什麽？這些事情女人家本來不懂的，六點鐘出寫字間，到九點鐘才回——來。」她把尾音拉得長長地使人難受。</p>
<p>「好了，我錯了。」丈夫還是溢柔地走到妻面前，「走罷，快開映了，這是最後的一塲了。」</p>
<p>「我不要看！」妻又回過頭去注視着窗外，「今天挨明天，明天挨今天的，你到底忙些什麽來着？打電話到公司里總找不到你的影子，哼，你當我不知道</p>
<p>「茵，這是什麽話」丈夫剛提高嗓子，馬上又壓了下去：「我早不是吿訴你嗎？我這個事情不是獃坐在寫字間里的，那末多的事情都要我一個人調排的。」</p>
<p>一我就不知道这些　　妻的喉　反而提高起來，「我從來沒有聽見過一個經理耍像跑街那樣子滿街跑的！」</p>
<p>丈夫擺擺手，覺得無理可喻的樣子？坐到窗前的椅子上，隨手拖過當天的報紙來翻着　把看影戲的事完全忘了，也不去注意妻的舉動，他的腦子里又盤旋着那筆交易了：長沙的輪船沒有開船的電報，而上海的客家催着要船，可是他不能放過這筆賣買，他的船回來的時候沒有貨色還是小損失，在這樣衰落的市面再不能被別家公司輕易地拉去戶頭，今天下午就同客家相商着這件事，他要求客家等過今天晚上，要是長沙再沒有電報來，他就沒有方法拉住這個戶頭了。但是他又記着妻要去看那個影片，今天是最後的一塲了，在八點半的時侯，他離開了請客家吃飯的菜館，趕到公司吩咐值夜的職員接到電報馬上打電話到他家里，再趕着車子回家，但是女人家知道些什麽：想着，他拋了報紙，又習慣地搓着手。</p>
<p>妻料不到丈夫會那樣子冷淡了她的，她更想定了她的猜測不會錯的。丈夫是愛她的，但這一向來丈夫沒有一天早回家的，那個影片已開映了一個星期，却老是明天，明天的挨下去，打電話到公司里又找不着人，她斷定丈夫是變心了，伏着頭悲切地哭了。</p>
<p>這時候電話間里鈴聲嚮了，丈夫記掛着電報，馬上跳出房去，但是妻搶在前面跑下樓去了。丈夫站在房門口聳着耳朶聽下面的聲音，他希望的是長沙的電報，可是聽不出妻在電話間說些什麽，半嚮才見妻踅上樓來，轉過了他面前，像對另一個人說話似的：「長沙電報來了，客家在公司里等你去商量。」</p>
<p>丈夫馬上想跑下樓去，却又回進房來，走到妻的背後，溫柔地撫着她的肩頭說：「不是嗎？那些事情才够人忙哩！今天弄妥了，明天陪你去看電影去。</p>
<p>「去罷。」妻讓過了他的身體問：「明天做什麼呢？」</p>
<p>妻底笑臉又映在銀色的燈下</p>

<p>— 紀難</p>
<p>初夏的薰風拂過了人們的面上，黃昏的霞飛路，迷漫着浪漫底氣息，幻變着的霓紅燈下，飄過了妖媚底女人的紅嘴唇，黑眼圈，長睫毛，一個年靑人尖起嘴巴吹出一隻舞塲裏頂流行的曲子來配合他自己的踏步，甜蜜的，熱情的，愉快而輕鬆地過去，黃昏是都會的一天的開始哪</p>

<p>我熟練地是人的山，人的，有嬌艷底貴婦人，也有安詳底夜紳士，架起八百度近光鏡底老頭兒，急急地在記錄上一　的結果，斜帶著便帽底呂宋人，兩手橫插在袴袋裏，不耐煩地踱來踱去，狂熱底人氣，嘈維底人聲，使我饑餓似地慌張起來了</p>
<p>球塲上的英雄們——命運的玩弄者，又活躍了，閃過了紅底衣裳，閃過了綠底衣裳，閃過了各種顏色底衣裳，球就隨著這紅紅綠綠閃動而飛逝，發出拍拍底響聲，一下一下地擊在賭客的緊張著底心弦上，擊破了多少人的熱望，雖然也偶或擊中了若幹期待著的心房，使它發出忻幸底微笑。公正人約哨子像是一個法官的判詞，多少人的希望在一聲哨子裏被摧毀了，多少人的命運一聲哨子裏被宣判了。希望在每個人的眼角上懸掛著，這希望滲透著多少的金色底幻夢，生命會隨著這紅紅綠綠底閃動而跳躍，命運被一下一下的球聲在捶擊。</p>
<p>雖然時間已經是午夜，但是塲子裏的人早已失去了時間的感覺，人氣格外的狂熱，人聲也更甚的嘈雜了。我把最後的兩張一元法幣從右手換到左手，後隨手在衣袋裏抓出一把預備回去的車錢的銅元一數，來決定這最後底命運。</p>
<p>一，二，三……十三，十三是一個不吉底數字啊！還是買二號吧！我憤怒似地把最後底兩張法幣丟到票櫃上換了一張二號的票子。</p>
<p>希望是很微渺的了，我好像知道這最後底兩元是不會開出美麗底花朵來的，不過在沒有知這結果以前，誰也不能說是全部絕望。我故意把頭回到後面去，想忘掉他是還有一點兒希望，而預備在漠不關心底時候，忽然聽見二號的勝利底喜報。</p>
<p>閃過了紅底衣裳，閃過了綠底衣裳，閃過了各種顏色底衣裳，球就隨著這紅紅綠綠底閃而飛逝，二號與三號各得四分，造成了最緊張底局勢。一顆顫動底心無法阻止它隨著球的飛逝而跳躍，我下意識地反手裏的票子　得緊緊地變成細長的一條。每個人屏止了他的呼吸，等待著要來的命運。幾分鐘後，一聲哨子結束了這緊張底一幕，各人的命運接著是像一萬頭關在籠子裏的蒼蠅欲飛不得的嗡嗡聲，一切都鼎沸起來了，一切的死又都復了，我像一雙鬥敗的公雞，踉蹌地溜出了塲子。</p>
<p>踏在午夜底鋪道上，有點淒涼的意味，望著遼遠的街燈，像做了一塲夢似的，我希望馬上見到第二天的太陽。</p>

<p>多情卻是總癡情。薄命紅顏自古云。我憲仙。幼失椿宣無依靠。伶仃養媳到　門。姑表訂婚原屬義。一家歡樂度光陰。更喜表兄情亦重。喃喃小語話溫存。　只恨，尼僧不空貪募化。悔只悔。婉詞陳阻結仇深。釵頭鳳，碎落豈有意。惹出非常禍不輕。播弄無非圖報復。世間可殺是尼僧。　言進母將奴害。萬苦千辛委曲承。姑怒不消心更變。竟使我，空門獨處受欺淩。惡尼賤業會誘到。為守貞操誓不　。良人何知遠赴試。愁腸萬種向誰評。朗離歸來幸見面。益悲傷，蓮花並蒂憶難成。可憐我，得賦斷腸豈忍讀。可憐我，淚珠點點溫羅襟。可憐我，思前想後難人夢。可憐我，反覆終宵　不寧。可憐我，憔悴容顏怕對鏡。可憐我，纏綿床第病真成。可憐我，鯤　應續再叮嚀。可憐我，絕而復甦婆婆喚。不能定省侍晨昏。願姑且把　眉展。須恕媳婦不孝名。自歎孽緣宿世定。折磨何必怨他人。只望蒼天知我意。人生聚散本浮萍。甘心瞑目赴幽冥。</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) Hu Hanmin passed away at his residence in the province at 7:45 PM on the 12th due to cerebral hemorrhage. Hu's illness began on the evening of the 9th at Chen Rong's residence, while playing chess with Chen. During the second game, Hu suddenly gasped and fainted on the spot. The doctor arrived and found a crack in a small blood vessel, immediately performing a bloodletting. On the 10th, there were also slight traces of blood in his teeth, but he regained consciousness. He fell into a coma again on the 11th, and passed away on the 12th (Special Dispatch on the 12th).</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Hu Hanmin's blood pressure suddenly rose on the evening of the 9th, leading to a cerebral hemorrhage. Chinese and foreign doctors, including Yang Zixiang, Bernot, Deng Zengde, and Chen Yiping, were consulted, but to no avail. He passed away at Chen Rong's mansion at 7:40 PM on the 12th. The Executive Department's Political Affairs Committee dispatched Zou Lu, Chen Rong, Liu Jiwen, Lin Yizhong, Miao Peinan, Zhan Jusi, and others to form a funeral committee. The first meeting was held at 9:00 PM that evening, resolving to hold the coffin ceremony at Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 13th, with the remains covered by the Party and national flag. Xiao Focheng, despite his illness, recorded the will. The Executive Department's Political Affairs Committee sent a telegram to the central government and the entire nation, stating, "Mr. Hu Hanmin, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee, suddenly experienced a rise in blood pressure on the evening of the 9th of this month, leading to a cerebral hemorrhage. Medical treatment was ineffective, and he passed away at 7:40 PM on the afternoon of the 12th. We respectfully report this via telegram." (Central News Agency Dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Hu Hanmin suffered from high blood pressure here on May 9th. Tonight, it suddenly developed into cerebral hemorrhage, leading to his sudden death at 7:40 PM, at the age of 52. (Reuters Telegram on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) After Hu Hanmin's death, southwest leaders convened a meeting to discuss the political situation, which adjourned late at night. Significant new developments are anticipated. (Reuters Telegram on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Hu Hanmin had intermittent pulses around noon on the 11th, indicating a serious situation. By the morning of the 12th, it gradually stabilized, and his blood pressure also decreased slightly, showing good progress. Hu has now moved to Yongyuan for convalescence, refusing to see guests. (Central News Agency Dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the news of Hu Hanmin, Chairman of the Central Standing Committee, passing away in Guangdong reached Nanjing, all parties were deeply shocked and saddened. After inquiring from various sources, the official report had not yet been received by the time of publication. (Central News Agency Dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>Hu Hanmin's Portrait</p>
<p>Hu's Brief Biography</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Mr. Hu Hanmin, courtesy name Zhantang, was originally from Shanyin, Zhejiang, and born in Panyu, Guangdong. He studied at Tokyo Hosei University in Japan in his early years, met the Premier, and joined the Tongmenghui in the 31st year of Guangxu, presiding over the Min Bao, advocating revolution. After it ceased publication, he went to Singapore with Liao Zhongkai, Zhu Zhixin, and other comrades, and created the News Newspaper to spread the revolution to overseas Chinese officials. In the 33rd year, he returned to China with the Premier and launched an attack on Zhennanguan with Huang Keqiang and others. Due to numerical inferiority, they retreated into Annam. In the 3rd year of Xuantong, the Huanghuagang Uprising was mainly directed by Mr. Hu and Huang Keqiang. During the Wuchang Uprising, Guangdong declared independence, and he was elected as the Governor of Guangdong. In the first year of the Republic, the Nanjing Provisional Government was established, and the Premier was elected as the Grand President, with Mr. Hu serving as the Secretary-General of the Presidential Office. When the Premier resigned, he returned to Guangdong as Governor. In the second year of the Republic, Yuan Shikai dismissed him on the grounds of his affiliation with the Kuomintang and appointed him as the Pacification Commissioner for Tibet. After the second revolution failed, Mr. Hu fled to Japan. After Yuan's death, he returned to China. In the sixth year, Li Yuanhong dissolved the National Assembly, and Mr. Hu defended the Constitution in Guangdong, forming a military government. The Premier was elected as the Grand Marshal, with Mr. Hu serving as the Minister of Transportation and Secretary-General of the Grand Marshal's Office. In the tenth year, the Premier was elected as the Extraordinary President, appointing Mr. Hu as the Governor of Guangdong Province. In the thirteenth year, he served as a member of the First Central Executive Committee of the Party. In the winter of that year, the Premier went north, and Mr. Hu concurrently served as the acting Grand Marshal. In the fourteenth year, the National Government was established, and Mr. Hu served as a member of the National Government and Minister of Foreign Affairs, subsequently going to Russia for inspection. In the fifteenth year, he was elected as a member of the Second Central Executive Committee of the Party. In the sixteenth year, the National Government moved its capital to Nanjing, and he served as a member of the National Government and Chairman of the Central Political Council. In the seventeenth year, he traveled to Europe and America to study politics and economics. After returning to China, he served as a member of the Central Standing Committee, drafted the National Government Organization Law, and subsequently served as a member of the National Government and President of the Legislative Yuan. In the eighteenth year, he was elected as a member of the Third Central Executive Committee of the Party. In the twentieth year, he was elected as a member of the National Government and a permanent member of the Central Political Council. On the tenth, he went from Beijing to Shanghai and then to Guangzhou. In November, he was elected as a member of the Fourth Central Executive Committee of the Party and elected as a member of the National Government and a permanent member of the Central Political Council. Due to illness, he stayed in Hong Kong for treatment. In June of the twenty-fourth year, he went to Europe for inspection and then went to southern France for recuperation. In November, he departed from France to return to China. In late January of the twenty-fifth year, he arrived in Hong Kong and transferred to Guangzhou. The Central Government dispatched Committee member Ju Zheng, Committee member Ye Chucang, and Committee member Chen Ce to the south to welcome him. Due to illness and fear of cold, he did not go north and stayed in Guangdong for recuperation. At 7:40 PM on May 12th, he suddenly passed away due to cerebral hemorrhage at the age of 52. His wife is Madam Chen Shuzi, and his daughter is Madam Mulan. (Central News Agency Dispatch on the 12th)</p>

<h3 id="e3">Smuggling Rampant in Guangdong; Customs Revenue Declines <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Smuggling has been rampant in recent weeks, leading to a significant decline in customs revenue. The authorities are currently making every effort to curb this trend, and have cracked several cases and arrested many people in recent days. The main items smuggled into the country daily are Taiwanese rice and Japanese textiles, resulting in lower retail prices in the market. Yang Lane (transliteration), a famous textile street, displays a large number of Japanese textiles, which the public believes to be domestic or Russian goods, and they are buying them in large quantities. Recently, large quantities of paper materials have also been transported from the Shamian Concession into the city. (Reuters Telegram on the 12th)</p>
<h3 id="e4">Smuggled Goods Diverted; Sales in Southern Henan; Shipped to Jiaodong and Qingdao <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Due to the establishment of inspection stations by the Hebei-East Autonomous Anti-Communist Council, which collects the lowest tariffs, foreign goods have been flooding in since March. Local Chinese merchants, regardless of their capital size, have been impacted by the dumping of smuggled goods and are on the verge of bankruptcy. Recently, smugglers, intending to divert sales to southern Henan, have abandoned plans to unload at Beidaihe and other locations, instead smuggling goods to Jiaodong and Qingdao. As a result, commerce in the Hebei-East region has become increasingly sluggish. (Special Dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Customs reports that too many smuggled goods are being imported, making it impossible to stop. Hundreds of thousands of people, directly or indirectly, rely on this for a living, and it has become a legitimate business. Even with armed anti-smuggling efforts, it is difficult to achieve results. Previously, only four types of goods were smuggled: rayon, sugar, textiles, and cigarette paper. Now, sea cucumber, dried scallops, foreign goods, porcelain, canned goods, stencil plates, printing materials, soda water, candles, and other items are all being smuggled. Military supplies were suddenly discovered on the 12th, which is expected to be just the beginning, and large-scale imports are expected to follow. (Special Dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Customs reports that in the week from last Tuesday to the 12th, the following smuggled goods were imported from Liushouying and Beidaihe in southeastern Hebei-East: 13,600,000 kilograms of rayon, 6,030,000 kilograms of sugar, 30,000 kilograms of cigarette paper, 3,000 bundles of cotton cloth, 8,000 packages of marine products and miscellaneous goods, and 4,775 cases of kerosene and gasoline. In addition, there were 20 boxes of pistols, with 20 pistols in each box. Half of these goods were unloaded in Tianjin, and half were transported to Peiping. (Special Dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) After the Tianjin Customs seized five Korean smuggling ships at Qikou, the Japanese side raised a protest. The Customs is currently investigating the evidence to impose penalties in accordance with regulations. The detained smuggling ships have not yet been released. (Central News Agency Dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to statistics from relevant sources, most of the smuggled goods landed at various seaports east of Tianjin are transported to Tianjin via the Beining Railway. After being unloaded at the East Station, they are then transported from Tianjin to the interior for sale. From August of last year to April of this year, the amount of goods that evaded taxes at the East Station is quite alarming, totaling over 90,000 packages of rayon, over 6,000 packages of cigarette paper, and over 500,000 packages of white sugar. In addition, there are unstatisical quantities of textiles and porcelain. According to the customs tax rates, the tax loss is over 10 million gold units. (Central News Agency Dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) It is estimated that the "Hebei-East Autonomous Government" can collect 4 million yuan per month in taxes from goods smuggled into eastern Luan. Now that smuggled goods such as oil and other items are flowing in again, this tax is expected to increase in the future. Smuggling involves both political and economic aspects. Unless everything is negotiated with the Japanese authorities, the local government's plans to prevent smuggling will be difficult to implement effectively. (Reuters Telegram on the 12th)</p>

<h3 id="e8">Implementing Land Administration <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>The conference of local senior administrative personnel has opened. Under the leadership of the Executive Yuan, senior administrative personnel from ten provinces have gathered together, and leaders with actual political responsibilities have personally delivered instructions. It cannot be denied that this is a major event in China's recent politics.</p>
<p>When describing the key points of the conference, President Jiang of the Executive Yuan solemnly raised the issue of land administration, saying: "We must understand that the land issue is a fundamental issue in politics, and land administration is a basic task in politics. If land administration cannot be implemented perfectly and the land issue cannot be resolved properly, political construction will not only fail to succeed but also be impossible to advance." The state of politics is originally built on economic conditions.</p>
<p>Before receiving the "reports on the situation of land administration preparation in various provinces," we dare not speculate on what kind of "joint resolution" this conference will make regarding the land administration issue. However, we hope that the results of this conference will definitely not start with land consolidation and end with increased taxation. Of course, no wealthy country will have a poor government. However, if the government's every move is aimed at increasing tax revenue, then the country will never become wealthy.</p>
<p>Solving the land issue as a fundamental political issue undoubtedly involves two major issues: one is the distribution of land to optimize the improvement of people's livelihood, and the other is the improvement of land to increase its productivity.</p>
<p>Many people, including some economists, believe that these two aspects can be carried out separately. The faction that values ​​land distribution believes that as long as the land is divided up so that landless poor farmers become self-cultivating farmers, the revitalization of the countryside can be expected in the near future. The faction that values ​​land improvement believes that today China only has the distinction between small poverty and great poverty, and therefore believes that increasing production is the only economic issue.</p>
<p>These two factions each hold a part of the truth. Without opening up wasteland or increasing land productivity, simply dividing the already cultivated land may not increase the happiness of the poor. Compared with China's total area, China's population is still sparse. However, if production technology is not improved, merely distributing the currently cultivated land to the people may not have much effect even if it is evenly distributed. Conversely, without restricting the application of land ownership, the slogan of land improvement will probably remain just a slogan in the end. Under the current situation, since the government cannot assume the responsibility of improving the land on behalf of the people, it will naturally place the responsibility of improvement on the people themselves. However, it must be understood that cultivators without land ownership have no intention of improving the land, and land owners who do not cultivate the land have even less intention of improving the land.</p>
<p>We believe that the work of land distribution must be carried out together with the work of land improvement. It is true that what the current government needs is not a revolution in land ownership. However, allowing the poor who have no land but have the ability to cultivate to open up and improve unused land, or at least unmanaged land, without compensation, and fully guaranteeing their interests is the minimum work in the land administration issue. If even this cannot be discussed, then it is not known what other significance the land administration issue has.</p>
<p>The prerequisite for this kind of work is definitely not funding. The biggest reason why all measures in China have no significant effect is the problem of having only institutions without work. The establishment of several land administration agencies can at most support a few intellectuals.</p>
<p>The prerequisite for this kind of work is the decision of a fundamental economic policy. If the government truly has the determination to fulfill its mission—Article 120 of the draft constitution: "The state shall, in principle, allocate and consolidate land to support self-cultivating farmers and those who use land themselves"—then all it needs to do is remove the obstacles to this kind of work. Specifically, it only needs to facilitate the migration of farmers, so that the nominal owners of land dare not obstruct the intrusion of actual cultivators, and to guarantee the benefits obtained by farmers through labor, so that the land has the possibility of being improved.</p>

<h3 id="e11">Conference of Senior Local Administrative Personnel to Discuss Civil Affairs and Education Proposals; Deliberations on Public Security Matters Today; Closing Ceremony This Afternoon <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) At the Conference of Senior Local Administrative Personnel, the general assembly on the 12th discussed civil affairs proposals in the morning, chaired by Jiang Zuobin. After the meeting, Kong Xiangxi hosted a banquet for all attendees. In the afternoon, the meeting continued to discuss education proposals, chaired by Wang Shijie, and adjourned at 5:00 PM. Wang Shijie, Weng Wenhao, and Jiang Tingfu hosted a banquet for all attendees, which ended at 7:00 PM. The general assembly will continue on the 13th to discuss public security proposals, chaired by He Yingqin. After discussions, the closing ceremony will be held in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The deliberation on civil affairs proposals resulted in six decided solutions: The joint office of the provincial government should still be thoroughly implemented to achieve the expected goals. Some joint offices have increased cumbersome paperwork, but the reason is not the joint office itself, but the failure to thoroughly integrate. After the joint office in Hubei, personnel and expenses have been reduced, and efficiency has increased compared to before. The relationship between the departments and the provincial government is similar to that between the departments of the central government. The commissioner system, if used properly, can assist the provincial government in implementing policies and supervising the actual implementation of policies in various counties. However, the commissioner's office should be further strengthened as part of the provincial government, and its authority should be further defined. The principle of the county government abolishing bureaus and changing them to sections is very good. It can reduce administrative expenses and avoid administrative constraints. However, it still depends on the complexity of the work, the amount of expenses, and the local conditions. For education and construction, if financial resources are sufficient, it is still appropriate to set up two separate sections. Establishing branch offices in counties can assist the county government in implementing policies and avoid the drawbacks of overly large county areas and difficult governance. However, the expenses and personnel of the district offices must be properly planned in advance. Actively promote land policies, especially paying attention to land surveys. The reporting is only slightly less expensive than the land survey, and it is not a fundamental solution. The central government should organize large-scale triangulation and aerial surveys as soon as possible to establish the foundation of land administration. Building warehouses and accumulating grain is rarely implemented in various places. Efforts should be made to improve this practice, and it should not be adhered to rigidly. Pay attention to how to use the accumulated grain to stabilize grain prices, circulate finance, and regulate the rural economy.</p>
<p>The deliberation on education basic proposals resulted in four items: Extending compulsory education and increasing funding: (A) Regarding funding: (1) A portion of the original funding of each county and city, if it is deemed to be similar to miscellaneous taxes, should still be effectively compensated in accordance with the order before it can be handled. (2) Designate one or more types from the various taxes of the central government or provinces (such as salt tax, deed tax, business tax, slaughter tax, etc.), or attach a percentage to a certain tax, and collect a sufficient amount to be used exclusively for compulsory education funding. (3) If difficulties arise during the implementation of Article 5, Section 2, and Section 5 of the Provisional Measures for Raising Compulsory Education Funds in Various Provinces and Cities issued by the Executive Yuan, the central government should provide more specific regulations to facilitate implementation. (4) Add a clause to the Provisional Measures for Raising Compulsory Education Funds in Various Provinces and Cities, allowing elementary school districts to solicit donations from households in the district based on their wealth. (5) A portion of the security expenses reduced by each province and the surplus from the reorganization of land taxes should be used as funding. (6) The central government is requested to double the compulsory education subsidy funding in the 25th fiscal year and instruct the provinces and cities to do the same. (B) Regarding teachers: (1) Teacher training is considered a major task for promoting compulsory education in the next year. (2) When training teachers, the departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities should set up temporary classes to train unemployed graduates of secondary schools and above and submit a request to use the central compulsory education funding. Improving productive education: (A) Each province's vocational education funding must be increased to reach the proportion set by the Ministry, and the central government is requested to allocate considerable funding in the 25th fiscal year to subsidize excellent vocational schools. (B) In accordance with the principle of cooperation between construction and education, the relevant central government agencies should formulate concrete measures at any time. (C) Each province's technical personnel training class should be managed by the Department of Education. (D) Special attention should be paid to the labor science of primary and secondary schools. Implementing mass education: (A) Regarding mass schools and mass training: (1) Flexibility should be reserved in the measures for phasing, to suit the actual situation of the province. It is said that this is determined by the central government and supplemented by the local government. (2) Unified measures should be formulated for mass education and mass training, such as civil soldiers, national military training, youth service, women's service, etc., and there should be close contact. (3) Rural elementary schools and short-term elementary schools should run mass training classes if they cannot implement the two-part system. (4) The central government should provide special funding to subsidize the funding for training teachers in mass schools. (B) Regarding broadcasting and film education, they should be implemented effectively in accordance with the original measures and attention should be paid to improving teaching materials and technology. Actively promote school and mass health education to train national physique: (A) The amount of health education funding allocated by each province and city should be flexible and determined by the Ministry. (B) In addition to the central government organizing health teacher training, the Department of Health is requested to assist each province and city in organizing it by region.</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Nishida, the Japanese adjutant, said that there are a total of 13,000 Japanese residents along the Peiping-Tianjin and Peiping-Ningyuan railways. The military feels that the garrison troops are too few to provide adequate protection, so they have slightly increased the number of troops. The outside world has spread many rumors about this, saying that the Japanese will take some action that is detrimental to North China. This is not true for those who know the truth. The number of new troops is not large, and the rumor of a division is inaccurate. It has not yet been decided who will succeed the Tianjin Commander. It will be announced within the week.

The special police patrol team has been withdrawn, so they are no longer arresting women who violate the rules along the way, forcing them into police cars, and sending them to the police department. Women's groups believe that this kind of action humiliates women and strongly opposes it, demanding that female police officers be hired to handle this matter instead of ordinary male police officers.

<p>(Washington) Finance Minister Morgenthau stated today that an important agreement will soon be concluded with the Chinese banking delegation led by Chen Guangfu, but declined to comment on the nature of the agreement. (National Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Washington) It is reported that the monetary talks between Chinese financial experts visiting the United States and U.S. Treasury officials are now complete or have reached the final stage. It is widely believed that an office agreement on monetary matters has been established. However, Finance Minister Morgenthau has indicated that the content will be kept secret. The Chinese representatives include Chen Guangfu and Guo Bingwen. The discussion focused on the extent to which the United States can assist China in managing its currency. According to White House sources, Finance Minister Morgenthau and the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Shi Zhaoji, were originally scheduled to discuss the silver issue after the New Year, but this meeting has now been postponed. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to a senior official, the talks on currency system issues between Finance Minister Morgenthau and Chen Guangfu, Chairman of the Chinese Banking Delegation, have reached the final stage. The Finance Minister will introduce Mr. Chen to President Roosevelt this week. Although this meeting will be largely private, it is understood that the discussions between Chen and Morgenthau have virtually concluded, and Mr. Chen plans to return to China soon.

<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt held a meeting today with Federal Reserve Chairman Eccles, former Treasury Secretary and Senator Glass, French Ambassador de Laboulaye, and Finance Minister Morgenthau. According to the usual practice for such meetings, an announcement is usually made afterward, but no statement was issued today. Therefore, it is generally believed that the discussion focused on the franc and its impact on foreign exchange, and that general U.S. financial issues, as well as the talks between Finance Minister Morgenthau and Chen Guangfu, Chairman of the Chinese Banking Delegation, were presented to the President. It is understood that the government has been paying close attention to the position of the franc for several weeks, but has maintained complete silence. It is also understood that the Federal Reserve authorities are very concerned about the continuous flow of cash from France to the United States, which has further increased the excessive reserves in the United States. Currently, U.S. officials have differing opinions on what fiscal and monetary policies the French left-wing government will adopt. (National Telegram, 11th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Council, continuing its meeting at 5 p.m. today, passed a resolution stipulating that the Italian-Ethiopian dispute should be discussed at an extraordinary meeting to be convened on June 15, and that sanctions against Italy should be maintained from now until then. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Council held an important meeting today and, after rejecting the strong protests of Italian representative Aloisi, resolved to retain the Abyssinian issue on the Council's agenda, which is tantamount to ruling that Abyssinia is still a member state of the League of Nations and should be protected by the League. After the Spanish and Danish representatives spoke against the Italian representative's proposal to remove the Italian-Ethiopian dispute from the agenda, the proposal was put to a vote. The representatives present unanimously advocated retaining the original agenda. Italy, as the creator of the dispute, its vote was not counted. After the vote was taken, the Italian chief representative, Aloisi, led members of the Italian delegation out of the meeting to express their opposition to the Council's actions and to the presence of Ethiopian representative Mariam. Aloisi declared that he could not allow the so-called Abyssinian representative to attend the meeting, and that only Italians now enjoyed the rights of Abyssinia, so any discussion of the so-called dispute was invalid, and he would not participate in this discussion. Thereupon, the Ethiopian representative Mariam rose to speak a few words on the status of Abyssinia. The major Italian-Ethiopian dispute will be discussed at the Council's public meeting tomorrow. It is heard that a resolution will be proposed tomorrow to postpone the issue to an extraordinary meeting around June 15. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The representatives of the Council member states held a meeting last night to discuss a resolution stating that the Italian-Ethiopian dispute should be postponed for further discussion until the Council's extraordinary meeting on June 15, and that the sanctions against Italy should continue to be implemented before June 15. The issue of the sovereignty of the Ethiopian emperor will not be raised for discussion at that time. (Havas, 12th)</p>

<p>Italian Chief Representative Aloisi is scheduled to lead members of the Italian delegation back to Rome at 4:40 p.m. today. A spokesman for the delegation recently declared that the delegation has been summoned home, but has not received explicit instructions as to whether it is a final farewell or a temporary departure. British and French sources believe that after the departure of the Italian delegation, the Italian government may withdraw from the League of Nations. Italian sources say that the Council's continued inclusion of the Italian-Ethiopian dispute on the agenda should be seen as Mussolini's retaliatory act for annexing Abyssinia. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Although the departure of the Italian delegation from the League of Nations Council had been anticipated, the news came as a bombshell, deafening to the ears. Semi-official sources recently declared that Italy has the right to demand that all countries lift sanctions and recognize the New Roman Empire, that Italy will not beg and will refuse to cooperate with European countries, and that another European country will follow Italy's lead and leave Geneva. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) No one knows what Italy intends to do by having its delegation suddenly leave and return home. It is impossible to know whether this is Italy's indication that it will withdraw from the League of Nations. However, Italy, in view of the League of Nations Council's attitude of maintaining the Italian-Ethiopian conflict on its agenda, clearly intends to threaten the League of Nations. According to well-informed sources here, Italy may not want to withdraw from the League of Nations, as Italian representative Aloisi visited League of Nations Secretary Avenol at 1:00 p.m. today to inform him that he had received instructions to lead all members of the Italian delegation to leave Geneva, but did not mention the possibility of withdrawing from the League of Nations.

<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Council held a closed-door meeting at 5:45 p.m. British Foreign Secretary Eden chaired the meeting. The Ethiopian representative, Wald, had already entered the chamber and taken his seat before the meeting began, which shows that the Council members have always recognized Abyssinia as a member state. Italian Chief Representative Aloisi then arrived and, upon seeing Wald in his seat, immediately made a long-distance call to Rome for instructions. Shortly thereafter, the Council announced that the meeting would begin. The agenda was first put forward for discussion. Chairman Eden then raised the Italian-Ethiopian issue and formally invited Wald to attend the meeting. Thereupon, Aloisi stood up and declared, "The state of Abyssinia no longer exists. The sovereignty of that country belongs to Italy. As the Italian representative cannot tolerate the presence of the so-called Abyssinian representative, any discussion on the Italian-Ethiopian issue is meaningless. I must therefore refuse to participate in the discussion." After speaking, he left the meeting. After Aloisi left the meeting, the Chairman declared that the issue at hand was whether or not to include the Italian-Ethiopian issue on the agenda, and that he thought it was appropriate to include it. Spain's Madariaga and Denmark's representative Menchu also expressed their support. The representatives of the Council member states then held a meeting at the invitation of British Foreign Secretary Eden in the evening, and decided that the Italian-Ethiopian issue should be announced as postponed for discussion at the next meeting, but the date of the meeting was not set. An extraordinary meeting of the Council is scheduled to be convened on June 15 to discuss the Italian-Ethiopian issue and the Locarno Treaty. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) After Italian representative Aloisi left the meeting, the Council immediately held a public meeting to discuss the other items on the agenda. At this time, Ethiopian representative Wald had left the meeting, and Aloisi had quietly returned to his seat. The Council then voted to pass several reports, one of which was drafted by Aloisi. It was then announced that the meeting would be adjourned, and the date for the resumption of the meeting was not decided. It is generally believed that the Council may reconvene on Wednesday (the 13th), at which time it will disregard the opposition of the Italian representative and resume discussion of the Italian-Ethiopian issue. Ethiopian representative Wald may give a speech at the Council on that day, and then the Council will formally announce that this issue will be postponed for discussion until June. People from the Italian delegation recently issued a statement saying that Aloisi was still present when the Council held its public meeting, which shows that his intention in leaving the meeting was only to oppose the presence of the Ethiopian representative. Other delegations said that although Italy claimed that the Abyssinian issue was no longer relevant to the League of Nations, the Council should still put it forward for discussion, which shows that the position adopted by Italy has been unanimously rejected by the Council, and its attitude is very firm, which is worthy of attention.

<p>(London) Prime Minister Baldwin stated in the House of Commons today that the British government recognizes Abyssinian Minister to Britain, Martin, as the plenipotentiary representative of the Abyssinian Emperor. At the same time, the British government has instructed British Minister to Abyssinia, Sir Barton, to grant the Italian military authorities the recognition due to troops occupying enemy territory under the principles of international law. On May 9, the newly appointed Italian Deputy Governor of Abyssinia issued a notice stating that members of foreign missions in Abyssinia would henceforth only be regarded as private foreigners worthy of respect. The Prime Minister's statement disregards the above notice. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Baldwin replied to questions from members of Parliament today, saying that the Abyssinian Emperor's residence in Palestine is a complex issue that concerns the entire League of Nations. Labour MP Cocks then asked that, since Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has declared the creation of the Eastern Roman Empire, should Britain contact countries in the Eastern Mediterranean for collective action to maintain peace? The Prime Minister immediately replied that he did not want to attach importance to temporary emotional remarks, which caused the entire House to burst into laughter. (National Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) The Cabinet met in the House of Commons tonight to study the international situation after Italy's annexation of Abyssinia. It is reported that the Cabinet advocates that the current sanctions should be maintained, but the final policy will be decided after Foreign Secretary Eden returns from Geneva.

According to Foreign Office sources, if the countries concerned cannot adopt a common policy on this matter, the British government will only issue a formal reservation without taking further action.

<p>(London) Italian Ambassador to Britain Grandi went to the British Foreign Office today to hand over the original text of the order announced by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini on Saturday, which stated that the land and people of the Abyssinian Empire have been placed under the complete and total sovereignty of Italy, and that the Italian King has assumed the title of Emperor of Abyssinia.

<p>Djibouti According to a dispatch from the Associated Press, the slow advance of Italian troops into the Abyssinian capital was deliberate, as this would prompt foreign diplomatic missions in Abyssinia to urge them to enter the city. According to reports, among the current critical environment, only the British Embassy had not requested assistance from the Italians. However, after the Italian troops entered the Abyssinian capital, suppressing rioters and looting and restoring order was not easy. In this pacification work, at least 50 Italian soldiers were killed. At the same time, the train from the Abyssinian capital to Djibouti was also frequently subjected to looting by rioters. (National News Agency, 12th)</p>

<p>Jerusalem The Abyssinian Emperor recently stated to our correspondent, "The League of Nations Council rightly refused to allow the Italian representative, Aloisi, to assume the role of Abyssinian representative at yesterday's meeting, which is very satisfactory. The League of Nations should not tolerate Italy's violation of international obligations. My purpose in leaving the country was to avoid unnecessary sacrifice of the people's lives and property. I have not yet decided on future plans and do not intend to announce them before they are implemented." (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Secretariat of the League of Nations recently released a note from the Abyssinian representative, Wald, the country's Minister to France, the conclusion of which is most concise: "Italy is rampant in its aggression, and the League of Nations is also poisoned by it. Will it bow its head and submit to violence?" The full text of the note is roughly as follows: "The Abyssinian army has resisted the invaders unyieldingly and endured hardships, and has repeatedly frustrated the invaders. The Italian government knew that it would not be able to win if it complied with the laws of war, so it disregarded justice and resorted to terror, sparing no effort to exterminate the Abyssinian people by the most cruel methods in the world. The Abyssinian army has fought hard to this day, and even if it wants to continue to resist, it is powerless. The Abyssinian government has also exhausted its voice and repeatedly appealed, but those who listen are few, and the member states of the League of Nations have failed to take effective cooperative action to deal with the aggressor state with obvious crimes, which is regrettable. The people of Abyssinia previously trusted the League of Nations, regarding it as a reliable support, but since the beginning of March of this year, they have realized that they have been abandoned, and all hope has been shattered, what is their disappointment? When the League of Nations Council met at the end of last month, the only solution to the Italian-Ethiopian issue was to delay it, which was another major blow to us. My Abyssinia is one of the oldest empires in the world, but the aggressor state, by its own will, does not allow my country to be among the nations. Will the countries of the world sit idly by and allow my country to be preyed upon by the aggressor state? I am here at the League of Nations Council in the name of the Abyssinian people to protest to all the nations of the world against the victorious aggressor state. The Italian government, which has previously disregarded everything and embarrassed more than fifty countries around the world, is now sitting here covered in blood after its victory, regarding the Council as nothing, and its arrogance is truly unbearable. It also wants the League of Nations to explicitly or tacitly approve its crimes as a condition for the country's participation in cooperation on European events, which is most shameful. It must be known that the Abyssinian people have not surrendered, and the vast land west of our capital is still intact, free and independent, as always. We still want to rely on this, and follow the example of other nations, with the spirit of enduring hardship and humiliation, to drive the aggressors out of the country," and so on. (Havas, 11th)</p>

Secretary of State Hull released a statement today in response, saying that the U.S. government had considered sending warships and troops to Abyssinia, but ultimately rejected the proposal because it would subject the U.S. government to accusations of deliberately undermining the neutrality law and would provoke strong protests from the American people.

So far, the Italian military authorities have received a total of 3,500 rifles, 90 guns, 35 machine guns, 2 cannons, and countless swords and spears.

<p>(Tokyo) According to reliable sources, Army Minister Terauchi declared in a closed session of the Diet today that since the Soviet Union first proposed concluding a non-aggression pact, relations between Japan and Russia have not only failed to improve but have worsened. The overall situation is now particularly tense. The Soviet Union has built numerous fortresses along the border between Manchuria and Mongolia. From the Japanese perspective, this move is indeed of an aggressive nature. The Soviet Union has not abandoned its policy of "Bolshevizing" the world. According to reliable reports, the Soviet Union's troops stationed in the Far East already exceed 200,000 and may increase to 300,000 in the future. In addition, the port of Vladivostok is home to 50 submarines and air squadrons capable of attacking Japanese cities. Outer Mongolia is now completely under Soviet protection, which is enough to surround "Manchukuo." This situation forces Japan to station a large army in Manchuria. The military has so far opposed concluding a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union, viewing the Soviet Union's proposal as worthless. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Asahi Shimbun today reported that Navy Minister Nagano stated at a closed-door Diet meeting discussing the budget that the Japanese Navy wants to have a strength comparable to the most powerful naval country that could attack Japan. In view of the current situation, it is absolutely necessary for Japan to implement appropriate defensive preparations, such as naval bases. Between 1931 and 1933, the Japanese Navy built an average of 22,000 tons of warships each year, while Britain averaged 33,000 tons and the United States 48,000 tons. The average cost per ton of capital ship is approximately between 2,500 and 3,000 yuan. The Navy Minister also said that the time for achieving equality with Britain and the United States has not yet been determined. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The gist of the answers given by the Army and Navy Ministers at today's closed-door meeting regarding Japan's national defense plan at 10:00 AM are as follows:</p>
<p>Navy Minister Nagano: Japan's operational strategy is passive. If Japan's strength is equal to that of its opponent, then the opponent can come and attack Japan, and Japan can also go and attack. However, Japan's policy is not to attack, but to maintain a military force that is insufficient to attack but sufficient to defend. Under this policy, we demand that we maintain a force in the waters near Japan that is equal to the strength that the world's largest naval power can send there.  It is not yet known how much it will cost to build ships after the treaties expire, but generally speaking, the cost will not be much different from the cost during the treaty period.  From 1931 to 1935, the annual tonnage of ships built by various countries was as follows: Japan 22,000 tons, Britain 33,000 tons, and the United States 48,000 tons. The cost of building a capital ship is 2,500 to 3,000 yuan per ton.</p>
<p>Army Minister Terauchi: People say that because the Soviet Union has advocated the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty, it will definitely not launch a sudden attack. However, this was the case when the Soviet Union was implementing its Five-Year Plan. The facts today are completely different.  According to some people, the Soviet Union's transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway proves that it has abandoned its Far Eastern policy. However, the Soviet Union transferred the Chinese Eastern Railway because it saw its value; it was not an abandonment of its Far Eastern policy. The Soviet Union is rushing to build military facilities along its vast borders, calling it defensive rather than offensive. However, from a military point of view, it is entirely an offensive setup. The Soviet Union has not abandoned its policy of socialism and world communization. It is now using the Siberian Railway as a center to send troops to the Far East, the number of which has reached more than 200,000 and may reach 300,000 in the future. This is the same as the strength of the Russian army in the Battle of the Sha River during the Russo-Japanese War.  Vladivostok now has 50 submarines and an air squadron capable of attacking the capital of Japan. It has also placed Outer Mongolia under its control, surrounding "Manchukuo." Because the facts are as described above, Japan must have a necessary force stationed in Manchuria. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A closed-door meeting of the House of Representatives was held on the 11th. The following is a summary of the questions and answers between the two ministers of the military and the members of the committee:</p>
<p>Tegami Koujirou (Minseito): The United States has no intention of going to war with Japan over the China issue. From a broader perspective, how about Japan proposing to the United States to stop the naval arms race?</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Arita: It is not yet known how the United States views Japan's attitude towards China and how it will respond to Japan's proposal. However, it is quite difficult to determine the extent to which the United States will accept Japan's proposal.</p>
<p>Ashida Hitoshi (Seiyukai): Since the treaties restricting armaments will expire, Japan can newly implement defenses within its territory. Has the government considered the cost?</p>
<p>Navy Minister Nagano: It is not yet known whether such a necessity will arise in the future, but it has not been planned for at present.</p>
<p>After an exchange between Ashida and Foreign Minister Arita regarding the state of Japanese goods being imported into North China, he said, "Regarding the issue of warship types, what are the advantages and disadvantages of the Italian and Chinese [strategies of] a small number of large ships versus a large number of small ships?"</p>
<p>Navy Minister Nagano: This is a question that needs to be researched and experimented with. However, we intend to avoid discussing the issue of warship types.</p>
<p>Okuchi Kihachi (Seiyukai): What is the estimated naval expenditure for 1935 to 1937?</p>
<p>Navy Minister Nagano: The figures are not yet known. Matsumoto Tadao (Minseito): Japan proposed equal naval strength for Britain, Japan, and the United States at the London Conference. At that time, did the naval authorities consider concretely realizing this equality within a few years?</p>
<p>Navy Minister Nagano: Because Britain and the United States did not accept Japan's proposal, the number of years has not been determined.</p>
<p>Miyawaki Nagakichi (Seiyukai): It is said that the number of armaments prepared by the Soviet Union in the Far East is exaggerated compared to the actual number. Is this true?</p>
<p>Army Minister Terauchi: The figures we have obtained are reports from reliable sources and are not exaggerated.</p>
<p>Hazeta Akira (Neutral): Will future naval expenditures increase to an alarming level?</p>
<p>Navy Minister Nagano: They will not increase to an alarming level. In my opinion, the expenditure will be roughly the same as the expenditure during the treaty era, with no major difference.</p>
<p>Hazeta Akira: What will future army expenditures be?</p>
<p>Army Minister Terauchi: It is not convenient to say.</p>
<p>Kamei Kanichiro: What about the secret agreement between the Chinese government and the Soviet Union?</p>
<p>Army Minister Terauchi: I don't know.</p>
<p>Kamei and Navy Minister Nagano asked questions about shipbuilding plans and defense issues. Next, Sakurai Hyogorou (Minseito) said that the Soviet Union's proposal to Japan to conclude a non-aggression treaty is a reality.</p>
<p>Army Minister Terauchi: We do not consider the Soviet Union's proposal for a non-aggression treaty to be of value. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>

<h3 id="e42">Foreign Minister Arita Answers on China Diplomacy: The So-Called Three Principles of Hirota Include Economy <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) In the general budget meeting of the House of Representatives, after Kamei Kanichiro of the Social Democratic Party questioned the Foreign Minister, focusing on economic issues in work related to China,</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Arita replied: Issues such as the establishment of reciprocal tariff rates will have to be considered in the future. It would be a mistake to regard the Three Principles towards China as a separate issue from economic work. All the articles should be included within the Three Principles, and we must also maintain our rights toward China. As for the issue with the Soviet Union, I do not consider it urgent. Then Kamei questioned the issue of debts towards China and joint defense work against Soviet "reddening."</p>
<p>The Foreign Minister replied: The purchasing of Chinese agricultural products and the sale of Japanese goods to China has already been carried out in the North China region. In short, we are always paying attention to the lives of the Chinese people. In this relationship, we are promoting close friendship.</p>
<p>At 6:05 PM, there was a recess, and the meeting reopened at 7:19 PM. Shinohara Rikuro of the Minseito asked the Minister of Finance about the salaries of government officials, and Fukasawa Toyotaro of the Seiyukai asked the Minister of the Army about the issue of Japanese officials in "Manchukuo." There was also some discussion about the survival of former Prime Minister Okada, which was answered by the Prime Minister. The meeting adjourned around 11:00 PM.

<p>(Tokyo) The general budget meeting of the House of Representatives reopened at 1:45 PM. Mr. Sugiura Takeo asked about the February 26th Incident. He said that the reason for this incident was because the punishment for the May 15th Incident was too light.</p>
<p>The Minister of the Army replied: I feel that this is one of the reasons, but not all of the reasons.</p>
<p>Sugiura asked: If military orders are absolutely obeyed, then how do you explain that the rebel army in this incident was prosecuted by soldiers?</p>
<p>The Minister of the Army replied: Please refrain from discussing this issue. Although the Minister of the Army requested a ceasefire, Mr. Sugiura did not reduce his sharpness. After a detailed answer from the Minister of the Army, he stopped. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the issue of military interference in politics, Army Minister Terauchi did not fully explain the need for further research from the perspective of a broad national defense when answering Mr. Shoto Takao. Therefore, the ministry felt dissatisfied. Therefore, Army Minister Terauchi, at the general budget meeting of the House of Representatives today, in response to a question from Nishimura Shigeo, briefly touched on the fact that active-duty soldiers are an element of the army and are sons of farmers. From this perspective, it is only natural to study issues such as politics, economy, and social thought from the perspective of a broad national defense. The current meeting of the Chiefs of Staff of the Divisions and Brigades is also fully studying various issues that are becoming the subject of broad national defense and submitting their opinions to the Minister of the Army, who then gives instructions. Therefore, I hope that this point will not be misunderstood. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>

<p>(London) At today's meeting of the House of Commons, Conservative MP Knox mentioned the mutual assistance agreement between the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia and asked to what extent Outer Mongolia had become an independent country. Prime Minister Baldwin replied that after the agreement was signed, the Soviet Union declared that the move did not infringe on the 1934 Sino-Soviet Agreement in which the Soviet Union recognized Outer Mongolia as part of the Republic of China. He also answered a question from Alfred about the results of the trip to Xinjiang by Deutschmann, a Chinese language counselor at the British Embassy in Beijing. The official's report is still under consideration, and no announcement can be made on this issue at this time. The overall situation in Xinjiang is currently quite peaceful. The British Consul-General in Kashgar is currently making every effort to preserve the status and rights of the British in the province. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) Sir Deutschmann, the Chinese Counselor of the British Embassy in China, departed from Beijing last September, via Bailingmiao to Xinjiang Province, to discuss issues such as British and Indian commerce with Xinjiang Province. Afterwards, he traveled to Delhi, India. In the House of Commons today, Conservative MP and Major General Sir Knox asked the government about the results of Sir Deutschmann's trip, briefly stating, "What were the results of Deutschmann's mission to Xinjiang? Can the government report on them? What is the current situation in Xinjiang? Does the British government intend to do anything to protect British commercial interests and other rights in Xinjiang Province?" Prime Minister Baldwin, on behalf of Foreign Minister Eden, replied that the government is studying Sir Deutschmann's report in detail and that it is not convenient to make any statements at this time. Regarding the current situation in Xinjiang, according to what the government knows, the Tungans (Ma Chung-ying's subordinates) have occupied Hotan since 1934, and are still entrenched there. However, in general, the province is still peaceful. Regarding British commerce in Xinjiang, the British Consul-General in Kashgar represents Britain from time to time and has contact with the provincial authorities. The government will do its best to protect British interests and rights in Xinjiang Province whenever necessary. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>

<h3 id="e54">Clearing Out Communist Bandits in Shanxi Province: Authorities Hasten Post-Disaster Recovery, Dispatching Large Forces Across the River to Pursue and Suppress, and Issuing Telegrams to Counties to Comfort the People <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: The communist bandits disturbing Shanxi, after being severely suppressed and routed, the remaining remnants have fled back towards northern Shaanxi. As of now, Shanxi province has been completely cleared. The counties that were troubled by the bandits are still engaged in cleansing operations. Investigations reveal that the communist bandits' incursion into Shanxi lasted nearly three months, disturbing more than thirty counties. Everywhere they went, the local losses were such that almost all houses were emptied. In some places, only scorched earth remained, uninhabitable. According to those returning from inspections at the front lines, although the communist bandits' strength has suffered greatly, the amount of wealth and food they looted was substantial. If the National Army does not thoroughly suppress them in their old nest in northern Shaanxi, the future hidden dangers are truly unpredictable. It is said that the Xue family, a wealthy family in Xinjiang, alone was robbed of 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. Some say the actual amount was even greater. Several families in Hongdong and Linfen counties were also robbed, and the amount of losses was even greater. Currently, the authorities are actively coordinating military operations to suppress the bandits, ordering forces to cross the river and pursue them. In addition to the central government's troops entering Shanxi, which will be largely deployed, the Shanxi army has also decided to dispatch its elite forces to advance westward. The railway between Pingyao and Fenyang is being rushed to completion, with a deadline of ten days. After the large army in southern Shanxi moves north along the Tongpu Railway, it will then be transferred westward along that railway.</p>
<p>It is reported that the Suiyuan Pacification Headquarters is not only urgently drafting the second phase of military plans, but also, together with the provincial government, is rapidly planning for local post-disaster recovery. Yan Xishan has specifically telegraphed the counties affected by the bandits, ordering them to actively handle the situation. The original telegram is recorded below: "To all armies, heads of all anti-communist defense corps, county magistrates, and heads of all advocacy groups: During this communist bandit incursion into Shanxi, more than 30,000 people crossed the river in succession. This headquarters promptly dispatched troops from all directions and requested the central government to send large forces to Shanxi to assist in suppressing them in dozens of battles, large and small. According to statistics, the number of bandits killed, wounded, captured, and surrendered is more than half. Later, with the completion of our blockhouse lines, the bandits were encircled between Xixian, Yonghe, and Daning, and repeatedly subjected to severe attacks. The bandits were exhausted and, taking advantage of the night, led their remnants from Qingshui Pass and Yujiazui back to northern Shaanxi. There are no more bandit traces in our province. Investigations reveal that the bandits disturbed more than thirty counties in Shanxi, harassing our localities, poisoning our people, and causing countless losses, both public and private. As the director, I am responsible for inadequate coordination, failing to prevent their arrival and failing to prevent their westward escape. Reflecting on my duties, I feel deeply indebted. In addition to informing the central government for punishment, all counties affected by the bandits should quickly comfort the people, expedite post-disaster recovery, eliminate the remaining evils, and intensify political work to stabilize the people's livelihoods and pacify the localities. Director Yan Geng (8th) stamped at noon." (May 9th)</p>
<h3 id="e55">Chairman Chiang Inspects Hunan Province, Overview of Hunan's Administration, He Jian Begins Organizing the Pacification Headquarters <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: The fiscal revenue and expenditure for Hunan Province in the 25th year of the Republic (1936) have been compiled and completed by the provincial government. The recurring revenue is estimated at 10,466,625 yuan, and the temporary revenue is 5,256,877 yuan, totaling 15,724,502 yuan. After offsetting expenditures, this is a decrease of over 868,000 yuan compared to the 24th year of the Republic (1935). Recently, since the communist bandits in the province have been cleared out, the province is now fully engaged in construction projects. The methods for suppressing communist bandits were uniquely created by Hunan. For example, the construction of blockhouses was designed by He Jian in Hunan during the suppression of communists in the 19th year of the Republic (1930). Furthermore, the organizational laws for the local militia and volunteer army were traditional methods since Zuo Zongtang, and He Jian has carried them forward. After Jiangxi province imitated and adopted Hunan's tactics for suppressing bandits, it was able to escape the communist bandits' troubles. Last year, there were many complicated troop deployments entering Hunan from various directions, and orders were inconsistent. Later, Chairman Chiang gave He Jian full authority, and he was able to completely clear out the communist bandits in one to two months. Now that the military affairs have come to an end, he is beginning to organize the Changsha Pacification Headquarters. Chairman Chiang especially flew to Changsha from Guizhou on the 27th of last month to personally instruct He Jian on strategies and advise the people of all circles in Hunan to work diligently under the guidance of Chairman He. He also pointed out that Hunan province is the central region for national salvation. After Chairman Chiang's inspection and commendation of the people of Hunan, their work has progressed even further. Investigations reveal that the Guangdong-Hankou Railway was fully connected on April 28th. For transportation purposes, the railway bureau has been changed to set up offices at both ends for convenience. It is planned to hold a full line opening ceremony on Double Tenth Day (October 10th). Furthermore, the Hunan-Guizhou highway has been 80% completed, and the Hunan-Sichuan highway has been 15% completed, with construction being rushed day and night, with the number of workers increased to over 30,000. Recently, Secretary-General Weng Wenhao of the Executive Yuan visited Hunan and inspected various construction projects, expressing great satisfaction and promising to allocate funds for subsidies after returning to the capital. The Hunan Provincial Government, in consideration of the suffering of the people in the bandit areas, has specially exempted Liuyang County from the full year of unpaid land tax for the 20th and 21st years of the Republic (1931 and 1932). There is also the initiative to designate Hengshan County as an experimental model county. Furthermore, Chairman He has issued an order to all county Confucius temples, strictly prohibiting military troops from being stationed there. A military-civilian equestrian competition will be held in Changsha on the 10th of this month, and plans are being made to organize a Chinese orchestra to promote proper recreational interests among the people. At the same time, the Provincial Anti-Smoking Committee has added a branch office for persuasion and abstinence in the provincial capital, ordering all counties to sign anti-smoking pledges to create a healthy population in the province and strengthen national power. Separately, Chairman He has drafted various suggestions for good governance and submitted them to Chairman Chiang for reference, and it is said that they have received high praise. (10th)</p>
<h3 id="e56">Guangdong Province: Luofu Scenic Spot, Zoned for Development and Reclamation, Wasteland Leased to People for Cultivation, Annual Rent of Two Jiao Per Mu, Exempted for Three Years <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Guangdong provincial authorities regard Mount Luofu as a famous scenic spot in the province. In order to develop the mountain and preserve historical sites, it was previously decided to transform it into a summer resort and build a park. Now, the Department of Construction believes that in addition to the designated agricultural and forestry areas and residential areas, there is still much wasteland on the mountain. It is urgent to designate sections of land as special reclamation areas and attract people to lease and cultivate them, so that barren land can be transformed into fertile land. Therefore, it has drafted regulations for leasing land in the area and submitted them to the provincial government for inspection and approval. The case was submitted yesterday to the 485th Provincial Affairs Meeting for modification and approval. The original proposal and the land distribution regulations are recorded below:</p>
<p>"Case: Regarding the case of developing Mount Luofu as a summer resort, the department previously drafted a plan, regulations, and budget, which were submitted to the government for approval and implementation. Now, investigations reveal that in addition to the designated agricultural and forestry areas and residential areas, there is still much wasteland on the mountain. It is urgent to designate sections of land as special reclamation areas and attract people to lease and cultivate them, so that barren land can be transformed into fertile land, and desolate areas can become prosperous. Not only will tourists become more interested, but nearby farmers will also be able to live and work in peace. This will provide some assistance in relieving rural areas. Now, with reference to the Mount Luofu Park Land Rental Regulations, we have tentatively prepared a copy of the Mount Luofu Special Reclamation Area Land Lease Regulations and submitted it to the meeting. We believe that this is appropriate and respectfully await your decision." Attached is a copy of the Mount Luofu Special Reclamation Area Land Lease Regulations: Article 1: Various sections within the scope of Mount Luofu Park, in addition to the designated residential areas and agricultural and forestry areas, will also designate several sections as special reclamation areas, allowing people of the Republic of China to consult the sectional maps from the management office, select sections of land, and pay rent according to the regulations. Article 2: After the land lessee selects the leased land section at the management office, they shall immediately receive a land lease certificate. Article 3: The annual rent for each mu of special reclamation area is two jiao, exempted for three years. Article 4: The special reclamation area is limited to sixty years, and the lease can be renewed upon expiration. Article 5: The land lease certificate is valid for one year. If the land lessee does not start cultivation after the expiration, it will be invalidated, and the management office may approve another person to lease it. Article 6: The official rent is one yuan per certificate, and the survey fee is three yuan. A replacement for lost certificates will be charged half price. Article 7: If there are any matters not stipulated in these regulations, they shall be handled in accordance with the Mount Luofu Park Land Rental Regulations. Article 8: These regulations shall be implemented from the date of submission to the provincial government for approval.</p>

<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Guangdong provincial authorities have paid great attention to the improvement of the silk industry in recent years. The Department of Construction previously established a silk implementation headquarters in Daliang, Shunde County, and implementation areas in Huanglian and other places. The area is actively engaged in the improvement of the silk industry. It also pays great attention to silk by-products. Over the years, there have been significant results. The director of the area, Liao Chongzhen, is now assisting farmers in organizing various silk cooperatives, using cooperative organizations to improve the economic situation of silk farmers. He first organized a silk weaving cooperative in Lun Jiao and Shi Fen, specializing in weaving improved products and handling transportation and sales. Recently, in Le Liu, Huang Lian implementation area, the organization of the improved cocoon silk weaving cooperative, specializing in the business of weaving improved cocoon silk, is progressing and developing. Yesterday, the mulberry leaf purchasing cooperative for silk farmers was established in Le Liu, handling the purchase of mulberry leaves and lending them to poor farmers for silkworm rearing. Recently, there has been the organization of the silk floss production cooperative in Huanglian. Various cooperatives are guided by personnel dispatched by the Shunde Cooperative Enterprise Guidance Office. The Agricultural Bank is also very supportive and provides loans to assist the development of various cooperatives. (8th)</p>
<h3 id="e58">Jiangxi Province: Specialty Products Exhibition Held, Ceramics are the Most Numerous, The Rest are Various Agricultural Products <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: For the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Specialty Products Exhibition, the two provinces have first pre-exhibited the collected specialty products in their own provinces, and then exchanged exhibitions for mutual promotion and sales. In the Jiangxi pre-exhibition, except for the ceramics concentrated in Jingdezhen manufacturers, the remaining items such as summer cloth, paper (fine and coarse), rice, tobacco leaves, tea leaves, shiitake mushrooms, tungsten ore, and coal were not concentrated in one place, so the scheduled opening date was delayed until the 8th. The venue is located in the former Xingying, now the Provincial Library. At 9:00 a.m., people from all walks of life and various agencies gathered in front of the library and the Shou Lequn Cinema for the opening ceremony. Over a thousand people, including Miao Peicheng, attended. The ceremony was chaired by Li Dezhao, Director of the Department of Construction, who gave a report on the significance of the meeting, stating that less than fifty of the eighty-three counties in the province had sent in specialty products, partly due to the lack of knowledge of business among the industrial and commercial sectors, and partly due to the county magistrates' perfunctory attitude, not knowing that developing specialty products is to promote the province's economy. Miao Peicheng and Yu Renqian, a representative from Zhejiang Province, then delivered speeches. After the ceremony, Director Li led the guests to visit the venue. The first exhibition hall is located in the Provincial Library. The first thing that catches the eye are the agricultural products from various regions, such as rice, beans, fruits, Guangfeng's tobacco leaves, Xiushui's tea, and famous local foods. Then there is the tungsten ore, which accounts for 60% of the world's production, and the nationally famous Pingxiang coal, as well as copper, iron, tin, and other minerals from various regions. There is also the Wanzai summer cloth, which is sold throughout the country and Southeast Asia, with many exquisite pieces. As for paper, before the import of foreign paper, Lian Shi, Mao Bian, and other papers had an annual output value of several million yuan, and many were collected. Among the woodenware, the famous camphor wood chests have many styles. The second exhibition hall is entirely dedicated to ceramics, with a wide variety of items. Various antique porcelains are the most valuable, such as the Yongzheng Wanhua Taibai Zun, priced at 5,000 yuan, and the Qianlong Wanhua Dong Hao landscape, priced at 3,000 yuan. Other works by the Four Great Masters, such as Wang Yeting, are also brilliantly displayed. It is said that after the closing ceremony, all the specialty products will be transported to Zhejiang Province for exhibition. (8th)</p>

<p>Last year, during the Double Tenth Day incident where a Shanghai-Chouzhou highway joint transport bus was robbed by bandits on horseback in the area of Lao Yanggong Temple north of Jinshanwei, the Provincial Security Command repeatedly ordered strict pursuit. Later, after the capture of the principal offenders Zhang Xiaobao and others, they confessed that Li Jinxiang was the ringleader. Immediate secret arrests were repeatedly decided, but the bandit leader was hiding in Shanghai and was never found. Recently, bandit cases have occurred frequently in various parts of Punan, and most of them were committed by Li Jinxiang's men. This time, Zhao Zanchen, the commander of the 12th Security Brigade, was ordered to suppress the bandits, believing that arresting the ringleader was necessary to warn the rest. According to confidential reports, the bandit leader was hiding in the Lan Ni Du area of Pudong. Commander Zhao hired a car to Shanghai at 3:00 a.m. on the 12th and arrived directly at the destination at dawn, arresting the bandit leader Li Jinxiang and his concubine Yu Xiaomei together. They then hired a car to escort them back to the team, and are currently under interrogation.</p>

<p>Cheng Wangjichang, principal of Suzhou Anding Middle School, was previously sued in the local court by over ten graduates of the school, including Xu Guoyuan, who hired lawyers Zhou Yuyong and Zhang Yu to file the suit. Because the school had not been registered for a long time, graduates had difficulty transferring to other schools.

Yesterday, the local court ruled to dismiss the plaintiff's claims. It is reported that Xu Guoyuan and others expressed dissatisfaction and are preparing to file an appeal to the High Court.</p>

<p>In Beitang Village, about three miles from Xietang Town in Su Township, a villager named He Asan owed a neighbor named Dai Tuquan 1,000 cash. The day before yesterday, Dai Tuquan suddenly demanded the 1,000 cash debt from He Asan. Because He did not repay, Dai angrily beat He. At that time, the villagers persuaded them to disperse. Unexpectedly, less than two hours later, He Asan died from his injuries. The villagers, recognizing that it involved a matter of life and death, immediately sent the murderer Dai Tuquan to the 6th Sub-Bureau of the local public security office for interrogation, and at the same time reported it to the Procuratorate of the Local Court. On the 12th, Prosecutor Lü led officials to the village for inspection, confirming that the death was due to injuries. He immediately ordered the family to prepare the coffin and burial, and the Public Security Sub-Bureau transferred Dai Tuquan to the General Bureau and sent him to the court for interrogation.</p>

<p>The six foundry factories, including Xicheng, Longchang, Huacheng, Guangqin, Xiangtai, and Sanxin, located by Huinong Bridge in the county, laid off workers to save expenses, causing a sit-down strike. It is learned that there are a total of eighteen foundry factories and over eighty machine factories in the county, with as many as two thousand workers. In the past, a foundry workers' union was established, but it was disbanded following the order to disband the General Labor Union. Recently, the county party headquarters has been actively restoring the General Labor Union, so the workers in the industry unanimously requested the factory to assist in restoring the union. At that time, the factory did not express any opinion, resulting in the labor unrest. The Foundry Industry Guild, because the workers' will was firm and mediation was ineffective, the situation was serious, so it convened representatives of capital and relevant parties to discuss countermeasures. It was decided that official letters would be sent to the County Chamber of Commerce, and then to the County Party Headquarters and County Government, requesting that they uphold justice and mediate according to law. Yesterday morning (12th), all the workers of the county unanimously went on strike. Although some workers continued their normal work, they were connected to the foundry factories. If the foundry workers do not resume work, the machine factories will inevitably be forced to shut down. It is heard that the authorities are trying to resolve the situation, but because no representatives from the workers have come forward to negotiate, a stalemate has formed, the situation has expanded and is beyond control, and it is difficult to resolve in the shortest time.</p>

<p>The home of Chen Xiangchun, a resident of Chen Lane west of Xiao Zhangjia Bridge outside the South Gate in the Second District, was broken into by more than ten robbers around 1:00 a.m. on December 28th of last year. They robbed a box cannon with number 331510, eight bullets, a rifle with number 1026, eight bullets, a white Lang Lin pistol with number 68358, six bullets, 117 yuan in legal tender, as well as gold jewelry, copper coins, clothing, etc., causing significant losses. The victim reported the case to the County Bureau for investigation. The day before yesterday, Zhong Jizhao, captain of the Public Security Bureau Detective Squad, received a confidential report that the bandits involved in the case, Tao Yalin and others, were hiding in a thatched shed in Dingjia Village near Hushu Pass in Suzhou. After receiving the report, Captain Zhong hired a motorboat and led detectives Dai Jingshan, Wang Bingsheng, and all the detectives, including Wu Bingkui, over ten people in total, to set off in the rain to make arrests according to the address. When they arrived at Dingjiaqiao Village in Suzhou, there were indeed two thatched houses. They entered to make arrests. At that time, the bandits Tao Yalin, Yu Rengen, Chen Heshang, and Zhu Zengfu were sitting around a table, deeply absorbed in a game of mahjong. They were all captured at once. A box cannon, a row of bullets, an old-fashioned front-loading gun were found under the pillows in their room. Matching the numbers, they were the same as the firearms lost by Chen's family. They were immediately taken to the boat for safekeeping and escorted to Wuxi. Captain Zhong interrogated them strictly. The criminals confessed to robbing Chen Xiangchun's home of firearms and gold and silver jewelry without denying it. Yesterday (12th), they were transferred to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Zhenjiang: Spring Cocoons About to Come on the Market, Jiangsu Province Promulgates Protection Measures <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government believes that with the silk cocoons about to come on the market this year, all matters related to protecting the cocoon market should be planned as early as possible to facilitate implementation. It has formulated seven articles of protection measures with reference to previous cases, and ordered commissioners, county magistrates, and security regiment leaders to abide by them in order to ensure thoroughness. The protection measures are: The protection of the cocoon market should be jointly undertaken by the public security bureaus, security teams, and water police teams of various counties, as well as the garrison army. In the area along Taihu Lake in southern Jiangsu, the most prosperous area for the cocoon market, an office should be established in Wuxi County during the cocoon season to supervise and direct matters related to protecting the cocoon market in the region. The 1st District of the Water Police Team should dispatch ten patrol boats, and the Civil Affairs Department should also transfer several patrol warships, and all ships of the 2nd District of the Water Police Team to the office to meet the needs of cocoon merchants requesting protection and to be dispatched at any time. Wherever a cocoon market is established, the public security bureaus, security teams, or garrison troops of the respective counties should be stationed on land to protect it. The Water Police Team should dispatch ships to patrol and station at different locations. However, if there is no Water Police Team stationed within the territory of each county, all water patrol matters should still be the responsibility of the public security bureaus and security teams of the respective counties. For cocoon merchants transporting funds via land, each line along the route should dispatch police to escort them. For those traveling by waterway, the nearest Water Police Team should dispatch ships to escort them. For those traveling by both land and water, the county public security bureau and Water Police Team should take turns escorting them. However, all cocoon merchants should notify the number of funds, the starting and ending points of transportation, the places of handover, and the dates in advance for thoroughness. In important ports and prosperous areas of the cocoon market, the county public security bureau, the guaranteed-departure team, the garrison army, and the office should intensify the dispatch of troops and ships to patrol back and forth day and night to show caution. All military police responsible for protecting the cocoon market, regardless of officers or soldiers, must not solicit rewards from cocoon merchants. If there are any violations, cocoon merchants are allowed to report them for investigation at any time.</p>

<h3 id="e73">Peking University Holds "May Fourth" 17th Anniversary Commemoration Meeting - Special Dispatch from Peiping <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Meeting Held in a Peaceful Manner</p>
<p>May is a month of many events, especially in this eventful Peiping. Therefore, at 3:00 PM on April 30th, Public Security Bureau Chief Chen Jiyan convened a temporary security meeting and decided that all police and security teams in the city would suspend their days off on "May 1st" Labor Day, stepping up precautions against petty criminals taking the opportunity to cause trouble. Sure enough, that day passed peacefully. The following day was the anniversary of the "May 3rd" tragedy, and fortunately, there were no unexpected incidents. Next came the 17th anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement.</p>
<p>Several days beforehand, news spread that any commemorative meeting would not be allowed. Even "Peking University," which at the time served as the main base, and subsequently added it specially to the school calendar each year, granting a day off different from other schools, according to school authorities, would temporarily cancel this day off this year. Therefore, on the afternoon of the 2nd, representatives from various classes at Peking University met in the reception room of the school's Fourth Dormitory and resolved to hold the commemorative ceremony as usual in a so-called "peaceful manner." The so-called "peaceful manner" contained three points: absolute adherence to a peaceful attitude, absolute abstention from strikes and demonstrations, and limitation to holding commemorative meetings and issuing commemorative declarations. Under these conditions, they obtained the consent of the school authorities to hold the commemorative meeting and also obtained permission from the local authorities to hold the commemorative meeting. Other schools did likewise.</p>
<p>Secret Police Swarming Inside and Outside the Venue</p>
<p>As the "May Fourth" Commemoration Day arrived, this reporter made a special trip to Peking University that morning to see what was happening. First, I went to the school's Third Courtyard, where I saw dozens of soldiers and police officers densely stationed in front of the antique gate and walls, along with more than a dozen plainclothes detectives. Next, I went to the school's First Courtyard. Here, in front of the Red Building, there were about twice as many soldiers, police, and plainclothes detectives as in the Third Courtyard, and the security was even tighter. Entry and exit were completely prohibited. Finally, I arrived at the school's Second Courtyard, the location of the commemorative meeting. In front of the gate and walls here, there was a large row of motorcycle police, two or three dozen in all, all carrying box cannons, facing west, and thirty or forty military police, divided into three or four layers, facing east, paying special attention to entering and exiting students.</p>
<p>The lotus pond area in front of the auditorium was heavily guarded by police, giving the impression of a sentry every five steps and a post every ten steps. Plainclothes detectives moved back and forth like shuttles, numbering over twenty or thirty in total. Whenever two or three people stood together talking, these detectives would definitely come over to stand and listen intently or deliberately run back and forth among the people, forcing them to disperse. When this reporter entered the auditorium, I saw several detectives in black hats on the podium, loudly reciting couplets for the commemorative meeting. The students hosting the commemorative meeting kept stepping forward to ask them to leave the podium. Each time they asked, the detectives always maintained that indifferent attitude. At 9:00 AM, the school authorities' representatives, Dean of the Law School Zhou Binglin and Dean of Studies Fan Jichang, arrived at the same time. At this time, a dozen police officers entered the auditorium and tore down the slogans pasted on the walls, indiscriminately, leaving only a cloth banner and a pair of cloth couplets. The banner boldly read "May Fourth 17th Anniversary Commemoration Meeting," and the couplets read: "Lost territory and sovereignty, today's worthies are inferior to those of the past, how can we bear to listen to the orders of the bandit police, sitting idly by and letting them be completely destroyed?" "Save the nation and resist the enemy, dying is more glorious than living, vowing to dedicate ourselves to the nation, striving for liberation and success."</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM sharp, the meeting was announced to begin. More than a dozen plainclothes detectives mingled among the three or four hundred students and attended the meeting together. Someone proposed organizing a temporary security team and asking the plainclothes detectives to leave the venue, but Zhou Binglin immediately dismissed the idea with a few words. He said, "This is absolutely impossible. We are already fortunate to be allowed to hold the meeting. In this situation, what freedom do we have? Moreover, plainclothes detectives are always following us anytime, anywhere. Since we are holding an open and honest meeting today, what do we have to fear from them?"</p>
<p>Students and Professors Roar Like Lions</p>
<p>The program of the commemorative meeting was very simple, with only two items, professors' speeches and students' speeches, being considered the most important. This program, it is said, was also approved by the school authorities. A total of three students spoke. Some of them said, "I hope that the external expressions will not be as enthusiastic and high-pitched as the internal feelings." Others said, "No matter what, we must strive diligently within the constraints of the environment." While speaking, they clenched their fists and frowned, and their inner anguish was obvious at a glance.</p>
<p>Later, the chairman repeatedly invited students to come on stage and express their opinions, but everyone looked at each other and hesitated to come forward. The Peking University students, who were always eager to express their opinions, seemed to be a little cautious in such an environment.</p>
<p>Not many professors arrived. The few who participated probably came after receiving the news at the last minute. A total of five people expressed their opinions: Ma Xulun, Zhou Binglin, Fan Jichang, Xu Deheng, and Zeng Zhaolun.</p>
<p>Ma Xulun, who is over fifty years old and has graying hair, has held important positions such as Deputy Minister of Education and Director of Civil Affairs of Zhejiang Province. He is an old professor at Peking University. During the "May Fourth" Movement seventeen years ago, Ma personally participated in the event at the school. Therefore, what he said was quite cordial and meaningful. His main points were twofold: striving is valuable only in the darkness, so seventeen years ago, he strongly opposed the southward relocation of the school; those who strive for the liberation of the masses will eventually achieve victory. His gestures during the speech were both solemn and humorous, captivating the audience. At such an advanced age, he teaches courses in Lao-Zhuang philosophy at Peking University while tirelessly running around and appealing for national affairs. In January of this year, he was the first to sign the first declaration of the National Salvation Association of the cultural circles in this city, and, along with Ma Xiangbo, the 96-year-old who first signed the declaration of the National Salvation Association of the cultural circles in Shanghai, was admired by the people of the country.</p>
<p>Dean of the Law School Zhou Binglin, who has held important positions such as Director of the Hebei Department of Education, has a deep relationship with the party-state and is resented by officials of a certain country. Last year, he was subjected to several expulsions and threats, but he remained unmoved. Since the student movement occurred, he has consistently expressed his views from the government's standpoint. However, because his words are quite measured, the resentment he has incurred is not very deep. In his speech, after recounting various memories of studying at Peking University and participating in the "May Fourth" Movement seventeen years ago, he still maintained his inherent position, advising students to study hard and prepare themselves for future service to the country. His speech was organized and concise, just like the man himself.</p>
<p>Dean of Studies Fan Jichang, standing in the position of the school authorities, advised students to maintain their passionate spirit and seek outlets in worthwhile areas.</p>
<p>Zeng Zhaolun's speech was organized and orderly, befitting the true colors of a chemist. He advised students to be unsung heroes and not just well-known heroes.</p>
<p>Xu Deheng's speech clarified the origin of the "May Fourth" Movement from the perspective of emerging sociology and affirmed that the significance of the "May Fourth" Movement was threefold: the masses directly entered the political movement; it was an organized movement; it was a widespread social movement. He also said that the current international and domestic situation has undergone great changes, and the "May Fourth" Movement is no longer sufficient. So, how will we use the spirit of the "May Fourth" to advance the social movement? While speaking, he raised his arms and shouted, and his spittle flew everywhere.</p>
<p>The meeting adjourned at 11:30 AM. Under the supervision of the military police, everyone filed out in an orderly manner. The 17th anniversary commemoration of the "May Fourth" Movement thus came to an end.</p>

<h3 id="e74">Statistics on Tax Revenue Losses from Smuggling in North China - Reaching Over 25 Million in Nine Months - Approximately One-Third of Total Tax Revenue <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Report from Customs Authorities</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, smuggling incidents in North China have intensified since February of this year, impacting customs revenue. The extent of this impact is of great interest to all parties. This is because a large number of our domestic and foreign debts are guaranteed by customs revenue. Therefore, smuggling incidents under the protection of the Japanese are by no means ordinary local issues. Their impact, politically, not only involves China and Japan but also has a significant relationship with the great powers. Furthermore, the customs' anti-smuggling system has improved rapidly since 1933 and can compete with the anti-smuggling systems of other countries. Therefore, if there are no special circumstances, the eradication of smuggling is almost an easy matter. The crux of the problem is therefore clear. The Central News Agency now reports the important points and figures regarding this matter from the customs authorities, as follows:</p>
<p>From August 1st of last year to April 30th of this year, customs revenue losses due to smuggling in North China totaled 25,506,146 yuan.</p>
<p>In April of this year alone, customs revenue losses reached 8 million yuan.</p>
<p>From August of last year to March of this year, the average monthly loss was 1.7 million yuan.</p>
<p>Since April 1st of this year, the rampant increase in smuggled goods has been unprecedented.</p>
<p>Assuming a monthly loss of 8 million yuan, the annual loss will reach 96 million yuan, accounting for almost one-third of the total tax revenue.</p>
<p>During the week of April 19th to 25th of this year, smuggled goods transported from Qinhuangdao, Beidaihe, Nandaisi, Liushouying, and Changli to Tianjin were as follows:</p>
<p>From August 1st of last year to April 25th of this year, the total amount of smuggled goods transported to Tianjin was as follows:</p>
<p>The miscellaneous goods mentioned above include dried seafood, kerosene, food, ammonia water, rubber, tires, rubber shoes, tinplate, paints, and sulfuric acid, etc.</p>
<p>During the week of April 19th to 25th of this year, smuggled goods transported from Tianjin via the Beining Railway and Pinghan Railway to other parts of China were approximately as follows:</p>
<p>In a report released yesterday, the customs authorities stated that the smuggling situation in North China last year can be roughly divided into three periods: the first period, from January to the end of May of last year, during which Japanese and "Manchukuo" people frequently smuggled silver coins. Two smuggling incidents on May 17th and May 25th were detected by the authorities, and the Japanese side immediately made demands, causing the customs to be in a rather difficult position. During this period, maritime smuggling had not yet expanded, and large-scale smuggling had not yet matured. However, from April to May, there was a large amount of silver coin smuggling, amounting to about 177,000 yuan. The second period, from June to mid-September of last year, during which the Japanese side made demands that were accepted by our side. By September, customs anti-smuggling vessels were forced to be unable to perform their duties in the war zone, and at the same time, anti-smuggling personnel along the Great Wall were disarmed. At this time, the smuggling problem gradually became serious. Customs personnel were no longer allowed to carry pistols, and as a result, lawbreakers became more active. According to estimates, there were about 400 Korean ruffians engaged in smuggling in Shanhaiguan and 100 in Qinhuangdao. By mid-September, Shihe Transport Company, which specializes in smuggling, appeared, employing as many as 1,000 Chinese coolies. Thus, open smuggling began. These lawbreakers all carried wooden sticks and pistols. If customs personnel showed the slightest intention of interfering, they would be beaten by these people, resulting in serious injuries, with no one to complain to. However, during this period, in addition to smuggling silver coins for export, the only smuggled goods imported were rayon, which was transported via the Beining Railway to other parts of the country. The railway authorities, under duress, had no choice but to allow its transport and were unable to resist. The Chinese side repeatedly requested assistance from the Japanese military authorities, but the Japanese side claimed that the matter should be handled by the Japanese police, and when a request was made to the Japanese police, they claimed that smuggling into China did not violate Japanese law, so the Japanese police were powerless. By September, the situation had expanded further. On the 9th of that month, the Japanese military authorities demanded that the Qinhuangdao Customs Commissioner remove all machine guns placed on customs anti-smuggling vessels. Although the customs authorities argued on the basis of reason, the Japanese side turned a deaf ear. As a result, the customs had no choice but to yield. A few days later, the Japanese side made another demand that all anti-smuggling vessels, whether armed or unarmed, be prohibited from sailing within three English miles of the war zone. The Chinese side, yielding to pressure, had reason but could not assert it. As a result, customs anti-smuggling vessels disappeared from the war zone. The matter was reported to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which made several serious protests to the Japanese Ambassador to China, with no results. The third period, from mid-September to the end of December of last year, during which the customs' anti-smuggling management can be said to have completely disappeared. The Japanese naval authorities completely denied China's three-mile territorial sea rights and regarded the search of customs anti-smuggling vessels as piracy, resulting in the complete disappearance of anti-smuggling effectiveness. As a result, maritime transport could not be controlled, and private ships from Dalian along the coast were constantly arriving. The authorities could only sigh helplessly. Since January of this year, in addition to maritime transport, there has also been land transport. Although the customs has repeatedly requested assistance from the railway authorities and the Japanese police, there have been no results. Recently, after the pseudo-organization of eastern Hebei set its own tax rates, the problem has become even more complicated. The Japanese authorities are making things difficult everywhere, saying that once goods have been taxed in eastern Hebei, they cannot be taxed again elsewhere, which shows that the tax rates set by eastern Hebei have been approved by the Japanese side. The customs report also stated that the seriousness of the smuggling problem in North China is even more alarming from another perspective. North China has always been a base for the transportation of goods. All goods transported south from Tianjin-Pukou and Pinghan Railways can directly reach the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The bulk of China's total tax revenue is in the northern part of the Yangtze River. Now, smuggled goods from North China are continuously transported south, and their impact on the national treasury income not only involves a corner of the north. According to last year's statistics, 88.8% of the total tax revenue was collected by 21 seaports from Qinhuangdao to Ningbo. It can be seen that private smuggling in North China directly affects 88% of the national income. The importance of the incident is evident. (To be continued tomorrow)</p>
<h3 id="e75">China National Products Maintenance Association - Cables Request for Strict Anti-Smuggling - Punishing According to Law to Maintain Chinese Rights and Save National Products - Newly Appointed Executive Supervisors Held Swearing-In Ceremony Last Night <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>The China National Products Maintenance Association held a swearing-in ceremony for the new executive supervisors last night and held the first joint meeting of the executive supervisors. Regarding the smuggling problem in North China, it was decided to cable the government to strictly crack down on smuggling in order to maintain the national product market. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Swearing-In Ceremony</p>
<p>The China National Products Maintenance Association held the 24th new executive supervisor committee swearing-in ceremony at the Dahongyun Restaurant at 6:00 PM last night. City Party Department Representative Mao Yun and more than 30 members of the association, including Wang Jiean and Zai Xingyi, were present. Wang Jiean was elected chairman and Sun Zheng was elected recorder. After performing the ceremony, the swearing-in ceremony was held. Then, Mao Yun of the City Party Department delivered a speech, stating that the association is the founder of national product groups and that its members are all backbone figures in the industrial and commercial sectors, hoping that they will continue to work hard to promote national products and enrich the country and the people. After Mao's speech, the first executive supervisor meeting was continued, and the following resolutions were passed: Wang Jiean, Wang Xingyi, and Huang Chucai were elected as standing committee members, with Zai Xingyi concurrently serving as director of documents, Xiang Jiangxun as director of organization, Mao Yaokun as director of finance, Xu Genghua as director of propaganda, Wang Hanqiang as director of investigation, and Chen Yiting as director of design. The smuggling problem in North China is becoming increasingly serious, affecting the national financial lifeline. It was decided to cable the government to quickly and strictly crack down on it in order to maintain national tax revenue and national product marketing. There are still many important cases that cannot be discussed further due to the late hour, and they will be discussed at the next meeting. The meeting adjourned at around 9:00 PM.</p>
<p>Cabling for Anti-Smuggling</p>
<p>The association yesterday cabled the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, requesting that the smuggling in North China be quickly and strictly investigated and punished according to law. The original cable read: To President Jiang of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance, and Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry: Recently, in North China, foreign nationals have been relying on special forces to smuggle large quantities of goods into China for dumping, and recently, it has spread throughout the country. The market is becoming increasingly rampant. Not only are Chinese goods and industries suffering the most, but they are also on the verge of death, and the shortage of our national tax revenue is enough to affect the national financial lifeline. If this continues, the consequences will be unimaginable. Such acts that endanger sovereignty and violate public law have long been noticed by countries around the world. The association, in order to maintain national products, is forced to make a special appeal. We earnestly request that Your Excellency the President quickly devise effective methods to urge the relevant agencies to strictly investigate and crack down on smuggling, punish them according to law, and thereby maintain sovereignty and save national products. We await your orders with bated breath. Wang Jiean, Wang Xingyi, and Huang Chucai, standing committee members of the China National Products Maintenance Association, respectfully kowtow.</p>

<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, the British economic expert specially dispatched to China, has been staying in Shanghai since returning from Nanjing last Monday.

After the organizational law of the Central Reserve Bank of our country is passed and announced by the Central Political Committee and studied, he will decide to leave China and report to his country's government accordingly. At the same time, he was commanded to investigate and report on smuggling incidents in various parts of our country at any time and to assist in resolving them.

<p>Our country's antiquities, after being exhibited in London, were handed over to the Jardine Matheson Company's Ranpura mail ship for shipment back to Shanghai. However, when the ship reached the Strait of Gibraltar, it ran aground due to wind. After three days of rescue, it was finally rescued. The ship then sailed to Marseilles, France, to inspect the hull, causing a delay of more than a week. All the mail has been transferred to Bombay and will be transported by the Sultan ship, which is expected to arrive in Shanghai first on Friday. The more than 90 boxes of antiquities were not landed and transferred to another ship, and the Ranpura ship was not damaged, so it was still loaded on the original ship to Shanghai. The ship is the Jardine Matheson Company's newly built first-class mail ship, with a very high speed. Moreover, because it is a regular ship, it has increased horsepower along the way, traveling at 22 nautical miles per hour. It is minimizing time at each port in order to arrive in Shanghai according to the original schedule. The company received a cable yesterday stating that the ship is scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong tomorrow and is expected to enter the port at noon on the 17th, preparing to dock at the Gonghexiang Wharf to unload the antiquities. It is also heard that our authorities have been notified in advance.</p>

<p>May 12th was the anniversary of the death of General Piłsudski, a founding father of the Polish nation. The Polish Legation in this port specially lowered its flag to half-mast yesterday to mourn and took a day off. All Polish侨民 living in Shanghai also closed their businesses and stopped entertainment. At 8:00 AM yesterday, Polish侨民 held a memorial prayer service at the church on Sainte Marie Road. It was decided that a large-scale memorial meeting would be held at the YMCA on Jing'an Temple Road at 3:00 PM on the 17th. All Polish officials and侨民 will participate, and Polish Minister Weidengtao will attend and deliver a speech. It is reported that Piłsudski died of illness at 8:45 PM on May 12th last year at the Belvedere Palace in Warsaw, Poland, at the age of 68. Piłsudski was born on December 5, 1867, and studied medicine at a Russian university. At that time, Poland was suffering from the pain of being partitioned. Piłsudski devoted himself to revolutionary work and was arrested repeatedly, but his revolutionary work did not stop. He was once exiled to Siberia. During the five years of the European war, Piłsudski secretly organized volunteer armies in various parts of Poland to resist Russia and fight for Polish independence, winning successive victories. In 1917, Piłsudski was imprisoned by the German government in a military prison. The following year, the Great War ended, and Piłsudski was finally freed, and Poland finally achieved independence with Piłsudski's efforts. A provisional government was established, and he was elected as its leader. When the formal constitution was completed, although he was elected as the first president, he firmly declined and retired to the post of Minister of Military Affairs. In 1920, he defeated the Russian army that invaded Poland again, and his reputation grew even greater. He was regarded as a national hero by the world. When he died last year, commentators generally said that Poland had lost its only leader from then on, which was indeed the most significant loss.</p>

<p>The New Sound News Agency reports that, in order to rescue the money trade, the Ministry of Finance established a Money Trade Supervision Committee at the end of April last year. It allocated 25 million yuan (face value) of the Republic of China 24th Year National Financial Bonds to provide loans of 25 million yuan to various money shops through the Bank of China, Central Bank, Communications Bank, various commercial banks, and the Money Trade Joint Reserve. At the same time, it ordered the rectification of business practices. Now the Money Trade Association has received another letter from the Supervision Committee, transcribing the instructions from the Ministry of Finance, ordering compliance with last year's directives and informing all firms to rectify any non-compliant points in their business operations. The Association has already complied with these instructions.</p>
<p>Investigating Firms That Have Voluntarily Closed</p>
<p>The following money shops voluntarily closed before and after the closing of accounts in the 24th year of the Republic of China: Yi Sheng Shop, No. [address] Jiyang Lane, Henan Road, North City; Zhi Cheng Shop, No. [address] Jiyang Lane, Henan Road, North City; Ze Chang Shop, No. [address] Jixiang Lane, Henan Road, North City; Fu Tai Shop, No. [address] Qingshun Lane, Beijing Road, North City. The Money Trade Association has received orders to investigate the external debts of these closed shops and clarify the situation. Letters have already been sent to the above-mentioned shops requesting replies. As for the nine shops that were previously assigned supervisors by the Ministry of Finance for liquidation—Yong Xing, Tong Tai, Yi Kang, Yong Feng, De Chang, Bao Da Yu, Xin Kang, Yi Chang, and Yin Tai—although the liquidation period has expired, they are still in the process of liquidation.</p>
<p>Repayment of Loans from the Three Banks</p>
<p>Various money shops previously borrowed 25 million yuan from the Bank of China, Central Bank, and Communications Bank. Apart from the 7 million yuan from various commercial banks and the Money Trade Joint Reserve, which has been fully repaid, only slightly more than 12 million yuan of the 18 million yuan from the Bank of China, Central Bank, and Communications Bank remains outstanding from Heng [莊名] and a few other money shops. Efforts are currently being made to repay it. It has been verified that the above loans are secured by reliable collateral, such as land deeds, goods, and bonds. The interest rate is 8% per annum. In order to thoroughly regulate the money trade finance, the Bank of China, Central Bank, and Communications Bank have made special accommodations, allowing repeated extensions for repayment.</p>

<p>The Jianghai Customs, in order to comply with orders regulating the carrying of silver small coins by passengers and crew, has issued Proclamation No. 15-2, which states: "Concerning the method of applying for passports for transporting silver and the penalties for secretly carrying it, proclamations have been issued several times. Now, in compliance with the order of the Ministry of Finance, the item of silver small coins, which are still temporarily allowed to be used as circulating subsidiary currency, has not been included within the scope of silver. Special regulations are hereby made regarding the carrying method as follows: 1. Passengers traveling to and from the interior may carry silver small coins in accordance with the regulations of this Customs Proclamation No. 1393 of October 30, 23rd year of the Republic of China, regardless of single or double coins, up to 300 coins per person. 2. Passengers traveling along the coast should, at this time when new subsidiary currency is being issued, take the carrying of new subsidiary currency as the principle. If new subsidiary currency is not yet widely circulating, and the Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank of China subsidiary currency notes are also not circulating locally, the carrying of silver small coins will be temporarily permitted, but regardless of single or double coins, not more than 60 coins per person. 3. Crew members and sailors navigating domestically may carry silver small coins, regardless of single or double coins, not more than 60 coins per person. 4. For all passengers, crew members, and sailors entering or leaving Zhejiang Province, the carrying of silver small coins, regardless of single or double coins, is limited to 50 coins per person. As for passengers traveling to and from the interior of the province under its jurisdiction, the number of silver small coins they may carry is still handled according to the general rule of 300 coins per person. 5. There is no need to apply for a passport to report the transport of silver small coins for export, but silver export tax and equalization tax should be levied in accordance with the regulations of this Customs Proclamation No. 1389 of October 15, 23rd year of the Republic of China. 6.

Since the implementation of legal tender, this ordinance has been generally abolished. As for the carrying of silver small coins, the carrying of new subsidiary currency should also be taken as the principle. If new subsidiary currency is not yet widely circulating, and the Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank of China subsidiary currency notes are also not circulating locally, each sailing boat passenger and boatman may temporarily carry silver small coins, regardless of single or double coins, up to a total of 120 coins. 7. Furthermore, passengers entering or leaving Zhejiang Province may carry up to 1,000 single copper coins per person.

<h3 id="e85">After the Hesheng Steamer Ran Aground in Tianjin, the Xinming Was Damaged by a Collision <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau's regular North China steamer Xinming, with a displacement of 2,143 tons, a length of 270 feet, a breadth of 41 feet and 2 inches, a depth of 20 feet and 2 inches, and a draft of 15 feet, was loaded with passengers and goods in Tianjin and first went to Weihaiwei and Yantai before returning to Shanghai. As the Xinming steamer was sailing out of the Baihe River, the British Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Hesheng steamer, with a displacement of 2,194 tons, was fully loaded with cargo and was sailing from South China and Shanghai to North China. When the steamer arrived at Xuegu and was sailing into the Baihe River, the Xinming had not yet left Zizhulin. Unexpectedly, because the Hesheng was overloaded with cargo and had too deep a draft, it suddenly ran aground and the hull was stranded in the sea and could not be moved. Because its grounding obstructed the channel, the Xinming wanted to sail to a shallower area, resulting in a collision. The Xinming was struck by Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Hesheng steamer. Because the Hesheng steamer from Dagu to Tianjin exceeded the waterline limit set by the customs, the pilot received a report stating that Jardine Matheson's Hesheng had already notified Dagu, saying that it had run aground in the Haihe River. The vessel (i.e., the Xinming) sailed out of Tianjin and collided with that steamer. The extent of the damage has been reported to the Tianjin authorities. The responsibility for the damage to this vessel lies entirely with the British steamer. When this vessel arrives in Shanghai, it will be necessary to notify the company to send a surveyor to the vessel to inspect the damage. Please consider this matter. Upon receiving the report, the China Merchants Bureau notified the insurance company and prepared to inspect the damage when the Xinming arrived in Shanghai in order to prepare for negotiations. As for the Hesheng steamer, it is hoped that it can be unloaded and towed out during high tide.</p>
<h3 id="e86">The Rice Industry Has Not Ordered Foreign Rice <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Although there are still stockpiles, the amount is very small. Orders were also given to instruct rice merchants to purchase and stockpile domestic rice as much as possible.</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of the Ministry of Finance's approval of the request to prevent the dumping of foreign rice, the reporter from the Central News Agency inquired with various relevant parties. According to a spokesperson for the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, after receiving instructions from the Municipal Government regarding the matter of the Ministry of Finance's request to prevent the dumping of foreign rice, the bureau conducted an investigation into the rice industry in this city. The investigation found that the rice industry in this city is not currently ordering foreign rice. Although there are still stockpiles of foreign rice in Shanghai, the amount is very small. The foreign broken rice previously ordered from foreign merchants has mostly been resold to foreign rice merchants en route due to price factors. In addition to ordering rice merchants to purchase domestic rice as much as possible in the future, the bureau also submitted the findings of the investigation to the Municipal Government for submission to the Ministry of Finance for its reference. According to inquiries from rice merchants, the Yongshang Chamber of Commerce ordered foreign broken rice from foreign merchants for disaster relief purposes, so it was approved by the Ministry of Finance to be exempt from all taxes, which has nothing to do with Shanghai merchants. Therefore, the various statements made by the Wujiang County Chamber of Commerce are clearly misrepresentations. Now that the price of domestic rice is low, it is impossible to purchase foreign rice. Therefore, most of the previously ordered foreign broken rice has not been shipped to the country for sale, but has been resold to foreign merchants abroad.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Inaccurate Telephone Metering, Users Petition the Chamber of Commerce to Intervene <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>City Chamber of Commerce Sends a Letter to the Telephone Association Inquiring About Recent Developments</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Telephone Company implemented its new regulations and charged per call, most users in various districts have been dissatisfied because the bills do not match what users have metered, and there are many floating calls. Every day, several times a day, they report to the telephone bureau asking for assistance. The situation is described separately as follows:</p>
<p>Inaccurate Metering</p>
<p>Tangshan Road, Hongkou, No. 548 and Greater Electric Company sent a letter saying that in addition to the number of calls made, there were as many as 181 excess calls. According to the company's own meter, only 72 calls were exceeded, a difference of 109 calls. The company is extremely confused and is now pressing for payment urgently, with no room for appeal, which is really unbearable. Therefore, we earnestly request your association to do its utmost to help and find a solution, which would be very fortunate. The Jiang residence at No. 7, Lane 432, Seymour Road, sent a letter saying, "We have read in the newspaper that your association is fighting on behalf of the citizens on the telephone issue, and we admire it very much. The telephone company is not only invisibly increasing prices and restricting usage, but also arbitrarily adding calls to the monthly bill and forcing us to pay. According to the company's notice, our residence exceeded 38 calls from March 13 to April 12, but our own count shows that we only made 90+ calls. It is self-evident that the company is arbitrarily adding calls. Therefore, we ask your association to intervene."</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Inquiry</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Telephone Problem Committee yesterday saying, "We have seen that your association is fighting against the Shanghai Special Zone's telephone charges. What are the latest methods of your progress? Please provide a detailed description. This is what we hope for. This is addressed to the Telephone Problem Committee of the Shanghai Special Zone."</p>
<p>Shareholders' Opinions</p>
<p>Since Chen Xianzhi, a Chinese shareholder of the Shanghai Telephone Company, sent a letter to the Telephone Problem Committee expressing his views, two other shareholders, Fu and Fan, have contacted Chen Xianzhi to jointly propose to the company that the proper way to increase revenue is to reduce expenditure, and to abandon this unethical policy of increasing prices in disguise. Yesterday, they sent another letter to the telephone company, encouraging them to fight forward with a spirit of perseverance and fearlessness. "We shareholders will never be greedy for this unethical official profit and allow society to fall into a state of unrest," said the letter, which was praised by Chen.</p>

<p>Discussion of Solutions Yesterday</p>
<p>After Qian Chengxu, a representative of the National Federation of Commerce and Industry, the China Industrial Federation, and the China Industrial Federation, petitioned to return to Shanghai, he discussed the solution to black tea and the establishment of a tea company with Chen Yizhou, Gong Mengpan, and other members of the Foreign Tea Industry Association yesterday. It is reported that the black tea issue is being negotiated by the Foreign Tea Industry Association with the Anhui-Jiangxi Black Tea Transportation and Sales Committee. A principle has been decided, which is that the tea warehouses will set up sales offices to handle the sales of black tea. Detailed methods still need to be discussed. After the decision is made, the exchange of black tea drafts can be resumed.</p>
<p>Establishment of a Tea Company Still Requires Further Discussion</p>
<p>Liu Yuanze of the Foreign Tea Industry Association is very much in favor of the establishment of a tea company. Specific methods still need to be discussed. If an organization is to be formed, the method of recovering the money previously lent to tea merchants by the tea warehouses should be considered first. Therefore, the date of the establishment of the tea company may not be possible in the short term.</p>

<p>Mr. Zhang Jiguang and Mr. Zhang Xiaoliang, leaders in the construction industry in this port, and Mr. Chen Jingtang, general manager of the former Jingtai Import and Export Company, are aware that the number of oil felt imports has been increasing year by year.

This item is necessary in modern building materials to prevent water leakage on roofs and dampness on walls, and it is also widely used in air conditioning water plants and swimming pools. After investigation, there are many types and different patterns, but the establishment of a complete factory is still lacking in China. Now, Mr. Zhang and others have come forward to organize a large-scale manufacturing factory in Shanghai, with a total capital of 200,000 yuan. They will use the latest machines and hire superior engineers to train workers. The products will be beautiful, of excellent quality, and superior to imported products.

<p>Baoshan County Has Now Been Fully Installed, Taicang and Jiading Counties Are Actively Erecting Poles and Lines</p>
<p>The Huashang Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, considering that the electricity for lighting in the neighboring counties of Taicang, Jiading, and Baoshan is insufficient, resulting in very weak lighting, and in order to support rural construction, has planned to be responsible for transmitting electricity from the plant. Baoshan County has now been fully installed and will implement county-wide transmission starting on June 1st. Taicang and Jiading counties are still in the planning stage and can also be implemented soon. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Baoshan County to Implement on June 1st</p>
<p>The electricity for lighting in Dachang, Guzhai, Liuhang, Yuepu, and Baoshan County City in Zhabei Baoshan County has been provided by the Dachang Da Yao Electric Lighting Plant. Recently, due to the vast area, the original generators are insufficient, resulting in very weak lighting. Manager Wang Yingru of the plant signed a contract with the Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant, and the Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant will directly transmit electricity. Dachang, Guzhai, Liuhang, and other places in Baoshan have already been implemented. In addition, Luodian Town previously had the Yao Ming Electric Lighting Plant, but the machinery was old and damaged, causing the current to be interrupted from time to time. After consultation between the local Chamber of Commerce and Wang Yingru, it was decided that the Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant would directly supply power. All installations have now been completed and will be implemented on June 1st. The surrounding towns and villages near Luodian will also be supplied by the Luodian distribution square shed. Therefore, the electricity for the entire Baoshan County will be directly supplied by the Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant starting on June 1st, and lighting will be available every night, which will also help promote rural construction.</p>
<p>Jiading and Taicang Counties Are Under Planning</p>
<p>Jiading and Taicang counties also have their own electric lighting plants. In order to support the local industries, it was decided to follow the same method as Baoshan County, consult with the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, and request the same electricity transmission. Both parties have agreed and signed a contract to install poles and lines along the Xihu Highway for direct transmission, and to build a square in Jiading and Taicang counties to transfer power to various towns and cities in the two counties. The initial construction will begin next month, but the electric poles in the two counties are still in good condition, making the project easier. It is expected to be completed in August.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Failure to Distribute Russian Oil, Clearing Debts: Guanghua Company Transfers to Asiatic, Will Fully Repay Loans from Four Banks Including Shanghai Bank, Machines, Oil Tanks, etc. Sold for Over Four Million Yuan - Company Name Still in Use, Only Distributing British and American Oil - <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The Huashang Guanghua Petroleum Co., Ltd. at 14 Museum Road, Shanghai, due to manager Russian oil merchant You Biandi competing with British and American oil merchants, has incurred huge debts. In order to protect its debts and clear its credit, the company has painfully sacrificed and transferred to the British Asiatic Petroleum Co. However, the company's future business will be supplied and distributed by British and American oil merchants. The reporter of Dagong News Agency has obtained reliable information, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Guanghua History The Huashang Guanghua Petroleum Co., Ltd. was initiated in the Republic of China Year 17 by Mr. Xu Shiying, the current Chinese Ambassador to Japan, and others. At the beginning, the capital was only 500,000. The company managed American Mobil Oil and sold it in various places. The business gradually developed. In the Republic of China Year 18, the capital was increased to more than 1.1 million. From Year 19 to Year 20, it increased from 1.5 million to 3.6 million. The internal business was divided into kerosene and gasoline departments. The oil depots were located at Laoshusha along the Huangpu River in Pudong and Danshuichi in Hankou. The chairman of the company is Xu Shiying, and the managing director and general manager is Jing Yidou. The company is the only Chinese-owned oil enterprise in China, and the good impression it gives to the Chinese people must be attributed to Xu Shiying's hard work and the efforts of all directors and supervisors.</p>
<p>Distribution of Russian Oil When the company was first established in the Republic of China Year 17, it originally planned to undertake large-scale operations, hoping to develop the large amount of oil reserves in various provinces in China, such as Sichuan and Xinjiang. However, due to limited capital, it was unable to shoulder this heavy responsibility. Therefore, it temporarily managed American Mobil Oil. After careful planning and determined management, it had a surplus of more than 2.5 million in the past three or four years. In the spring of the Republic of China Year 20, UP.T (transliterated as You Biandi), a Russian oil merchant, wanted to develop a market in the Far East and compete with British and American oil merchants. However, there was no market base (i.e., distribution points and oil storage tanks). Therefore, they repeatedly consulted with Guanghua Company to discuss how to withdraw Mobil Oil and switch to distributing Russian oil. After a long period of consultation, a contract was finally signed. Guanghua Company immediately withdrew from managing American oil and officially accepted the distribution of Russian oil.</p>
<p>Competition Among Three Countries After the Russian merchants solved the problem of the oil sales market in China, they used their large amount of oil production to dump oil in China. Before the Russian oil market in the Republic of China Year 20, the oil prices of British Asiatic and American Mobil Texaco were the highest, and the selling price was more than ten yuan per box. When Russian oil was first shipped to China, it was about nine yuan per box. The oil merchants of that country wanted to control the expansion of the British and American oil market, so they depreciated and dumped oil. The lowest price was only six yuan and six jiao per box. Sales soared, and British and American oil merchants also reduced prices to compete, and the market suddenly became chaotic. This was truly an unprecedented initiative in the history of the oil industry.</p>
<p>Borrowing for Construction When British, American, and Russian oil merchants were fiercely competing, Guanghua Company, although in a distribution position, did not bear any operating losses. However, in order to store a large amount of oil reserves, and to transport ships and machinery, it was necessary to have sufficient preparation. Therefore, the company specially borrowed five million yuan from four banks in Shanghai, the Mainland, Guohuo, and Guohua, using the land and oil tanks as collateral. After the loan was established, in addition to expanding the original oil depot in Laoshusha, Pudong, it also added oil tanks in Danshuichi, Hankou, costing more than 4.5 million yuan. The full term of the loan contract was limited to July of the Republic of China Year 24. Later, Russian oil suffered too much loss due to competition, and the pain was deep. Therefore, the contract with Guanghua was terminated. Now Russian oil has completely abandoned the Far East market.</p>
<p>State-Owned Operation Failed The company's total capital was eventually increased to 3.6 million yuan. Later, it purchased machinery and built oil tanks, and borrowed another five million yuan from the bank, plus the surplus of more than 2 million yuan when managing American oil, totaling more than 10 million yuan. During the competition among the three oil merchants, it lost two or three million yuan over three years. But in fact, the company itself did not lose money, and what it owed was now converted into various construction fixed assets. At a difficult time, it applied to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry for a loan of 10 million yuan for relief, to be taken over by the government as a state-owned enterprise. When Minister Chen Gongbo was in charge of the Ministry of Industry, he sent the Mining Department to Shanghai to investigate, and all agreed that this enterprise should be supported by the state to avoid falling into the hands of foreigners. Unfortunately, due to the depletion of the national treasury, they were sincere but powerless, and it failed to become a reality.</p>
<p>Transfer to British Merchants In order to maintain the repayment of bank debts and credit, the company painfully sacrificed and now sold the base of the oil land in Laoshusha, Pudong, to the Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank for 960,000 yuan, to repay the bank's debt. It also transferred various equipment such as machines, oil tanks, and ships to the British Asiatic Petroleum Co. for more than 3.2 million yuan. Both parties have signed the agreement. At the same time, the American Mobil Oil Co. has also joined as a transferee and cooperated with the British Asiatic. The Guanghua Company authorities have now fully repaid the overdue debts of the bank.</p>
<p>Business As Usual According to the Dagong News Agency's investigation from both the British Asiatic and Guanghua Company, although Guanghua Company has fully transferred the oil tanks and other properties to the British merchants, the company's future business will be supplied by the British Asiatic and Mobil oil merchants. However, its total business volume shall not exceed one-tenth of the total annual volume of the British and American companies, that is, the kerosene distribution quantity shall not exceed 100,000 boxes. The distribution commission part is still under negotiation. As for the Guanghua name, it will still be used externally, and the oil sales area can be operated in the market base of British and American merchants in China. (Dagong News Agency)</p>

<p>Gu Songmao, chairman of the Shanghai Rickshaw Guild Committee (Gu Sanlaoguan, the brother of Gu Zhuxuan), was recently sued by Zheng Fazhu from Yancheng, represented by a lawyer, in the Criminal Court of the District Court, accusing Gu Songmao of forging seals, etc. After receiving the indictment, the court repeatedly summoned him. Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, Judge Zhang opened the court again for further trial. Zheng Fazhu testified that during the rickshaw drivers' strike in the 23rd year of the Republic of China, the defendant accused me of instigating it and sued me in the Civil Court of the First Special District Court for compensation for damages. After the trial, Gu Songmao's lawsuit was dismissed. The defendant's lawsuit for compensation was not signed by the fellow tradesmen, but the defendant fabricated a seal and filed a lawsuit in the court. Therefore, I request legal action. Next, the defendant Gu Songmao testified that I am a member of the Rickshaw Congress, and the matter of suing the prosecutor in the First Special District Court for compensation was decided by a meeting of all the fellow tradesmen, and I was elected to be responsible for filing a lawsuit in the court. There is a meeting record book of the guild that can be consulted. More than 50 witnesses, including Bao Zhenhuang, Chen Liu, etc., came to the court to testify. The interrogator said that there was still a need to summon witnesses in this case and ordered to continue the trial after further summons.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Petitions the Central Government for Prior Payment of Labor Creditors <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency, in recent years, the city's economy has been depressed, and all industries have been declining. Factories and shops have closed down and declared liquidation every day. However, regarding the issue of labor creditors' rights obtained from sweat and blood, which should be given the highest priority in repayment, although various parties have requested it, there are no clear provisions in the current laws. In order to protect the due rights of workers, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has followed the resolution of the Fourth All-City Workers' Congress and specially prepared a document to be submitted to the Central Political Committee, the Executive Yuan, and the Legislative Yuan, requesting that laws be formulated and promulgated for implementation. The original petition is recorded as follows: A petition requesting the stipulation that labor creditors' rights should have the right to be repaid first in order to maintain the livelihood of workers. I have secretly investigated the current laws and regulations, and there are no provisions for the priority of repayment of rights obtained by workers due to employment relations. For example, Article 35 of the Trade Union Law stipulates that "when the debtor of food and wages goes bankrupt, he has the right to request priority repayment of his property." As for the factory and the section on employment in the Civil Code, there are only principles for the payment methods, locations, and periods of wages. There is no mention of the priority of wage repayment. There is no word mentioned. The recently promulgated bankruptcy law has a total of 112 articles, although there is a clear statement that "debts with priority rights over the property of the bankrupt property group shall be repaid before other debts," but it does not enumerate what kind of debts are stipulated. Therefore, when an employer goes bankrupt or closes down, workers' wages and other debts arising from employment relations (such as security deposits, public accumulation funds, etc.) cannot be clearly claimed and repaid first according to the law, and the court cannot base its judgment on its right to be repaid first. Often, the lawsuit ends in victory, but the result cannot be enforced. This is because in recent years, the city's economy has been sluggish, and most employers are strong on the outside but weak on the inside. All their assets are mortgaged to banks and money shops for maintenance, and these creditors' rights obtained due to mortgage rights or pledge rights all have priority in law. If an employer goes bankrupt or closes down, his property will be seized by the pledgees and pledgees. Workers will eventually be unable to seek compensation. Even if the government mediates and arbitrates and is lucky enough to get some share, the exchange of letters and telegrams is already a greater loss than gain. This is a common phenomenon in recent years and is the biggest crisis in society. If a way to stabilize is not sought quickly, it will inevitably affect the entire social security and make the country and the nation suffer endless influence. The workers' creditors' rights are purely obtained from sweat and hard work and are the basis of the whole family's life. The nature of these creditors' rights is completely different from other creditors' rights. If they are not given the right to be repaid first, their livelihood will be cut off. Is this not the fairness of things? Modern laws tend to be socialized, with the principle of protecting the economically weak and maintaining the welfare of the majority. Therefore, all advanced industrial countries stipulate that workers' creditors' rights obtained due to employment relations have the right to be repaid first. This is because workers have a low economic status. Without close protection, it is not enough to prevent illegal infringements. In view of the domestic industrial and commercial difficulties and the difficult livelihood of workers, the association has, through the Fourth Congress of Representatives, resolved to petition the central government to stipulate that labor creditors' rights should have the right to prior repayment. It is specially written to petition Jun (Hui) (Yuan), requesting that the Legislative Yuan be consulted and urgently formulate laws and promulgate them for implementation in order to maintain the livelihood of workers and maintain social order. Respectfully presented to the Central Executive Committee, the Executive Yuan, and the Legislative Yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e115">The Sino-Foreign Relief Committee Dispatches a Special Commissioner to Inspect the Anhui Disaster, Continued Report <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The Sino-Foreign Relief Committee on Renji Road, considering the severity of the drought in northern Anhui, has already distributed 4,800 yuan to Huo Qiu, 4,800 yuan to Fuyang, 3,000 yuan to Shou County, 2,400 yuan to Yingshang, 1,500 yuan to Taihe, 1,500 yuan to Linchuan (transliteration), 1,000 yuan to Fengtai, and 1,000 yuan to Guoyang. In addition to setting up a branch in Fuyang to actively carry out relief efforts, they have also dispatched a special commissioner to inspect the situation and ascertain the truth. According to the report, the investigation into the situation in Shou County was previously published. Now, the report continues with an on-site survey of the disaster conditions in Zhengyangguan and Yingshang County, recorded as follows: Zhengyangguan, although belonging to the fifth district of Shou County, actually occupies four-tenths of the county's area, and the disaster area accounts for seven-tenths of that. The losses amount to more than 1.4 million yuan, lasting for five months. Over 70,000 people are awaiting relief, so special attention must be paid. Walking more than ten li from the South Gate to the East Gate, one sees disaster victims mostly eating wild vegetables. If this continues for a few more days, the situation is unimaginable. Moreover, the land and water transportation there is relatively convenient, so many people fleeing famine from neighboring counties have also come there, making the situation even more precarious. Continuing to Huo Qiu, the Fuyang branch of the committee had just allocated 4,800 yuan for relief, divided into three yuan, two yuan, and one yuan levels for distribution. Those in special circumstances receive an additional five jiao. Details of the distribution will be reported later. Proceeding to Yingshang, the county is located between the Huai and Ying Rivers, bordering Huo Qiu to the south. The area has always been known for its poverty and suffering. Since the major flood of Xinwei year, there have been consecutive years of famine. This year's spring famine is particularly severe. Disaster victims mostly dig up grass roots and tree bark to prolong their lives, and many have starved to death. There are also cases of selling wives and children to exchange for grain to fill their hunger, and even entire families committing suicide, the situation is extremely tragic. The county is divided into three districts, but the second district has the widest disaster area, especially in places like Nanzhao and Gengpeng Runhe. The third district, north of the Ying River, is also severely affected. The first district is slightly better. With the arrival of the spring famine, the county government has actively established more than twenty porridge kitchens, with more than three thousand people coming to the city to eat every day. However, funds are tight, and without substantial financial assistance, disaster victims will inevitably starve to death, it is said.</p>

<p>Plan Outline</p>
<p>The full text of the Shanghai 15th Health Movement Plan Outline states, "The 15th Shanghai Health Movement is a continuation of the previous 14th Health Movement. Therefore, its work should continue the past and usher in the future, connecting with the previous session and laying the groundwork for the future. The matters held in the 14th Health Movement should be continued, taking into account current needs, while on the other hand, a new focus of work should be selected as the characteristics and trends of this Health Movement. The National Government has issued a Children's Year from August 24th to July 25th of the following year. This Health Movement coincides with this event and is held during the implementation period of Children's Year. Therefore, children are the main target of its activities, and the dissemination of parental health knowledge is secondary, in order to achieve a mutually beneficial effect and spread health knowledge in ordinary families. This is in terms of the specific principles of this Health Movement. If measured by facts, this Health Movement, in addition to inheriting past work, also bears the mission of enlightening children's health and imparting family health knowledge. Therefore, its complexity and scope are even greater than those of previous Health Movements. However, as such, the expenses are inevitably huge. At a time when the city is exhausted and the social and economic conditions are difficult, it is not realistic to allow this Health Movement to spend too much. Therefore, there must be some changes in the methods, that is, to earnestly contact and cooperate with cooperating institutions or groups, in order to obtain the union and assistance in terms of material, spiritual, and work, and to reduce a part of the burden of this Health Movement. The matters of inheritance and the work of creation are divided into two major categories, which are described as follows: A. Matters of inheritance, 1. General health propaganda: 1. Select a suitable location to hold a grand exhibition for 10 to 20 days, to display various propaganda materials related to health, such as models, specimens, magazines, books, instruments, hanging pictures, tables, photos, etc. These exhibits should be widely collected in advance, so that the arrangement can be unhurried, orderly, and avoid duplication, and easy to manage. It can give the audience a systematic and profound impression, and it is hoped that they will understand the structure of the human body and the causes of diseases, and know what to be alert to after the meeting, and pay attention to maternal and infant health. 2. Major newspapers publish a special issue one day, publishing health propaganda texts. 3. Distribute slogans and leaflets by plane. 4. Paste slogans on streets, playgrounds, trams, and buses. 5. Invite the mayor and celebrities to broadcast speeches on the city's radio station. 6. Ask the Social Affairs Bureau to order the city's entertainment groups to sing or broadcast health songs and plays (the plays are supplied by the association, or handed over to the Social Affairs Bureau for review by this bureau). 7. Formulate fixed enamel slogans (can be negotiated to donate some according to their ability). 2. Free vaccination against cholera, typhoid fever, and dysentery mixed vaccine is provided to citizens for large-scale mixed vaccine vaccination. 3. Cleanliness movement. 1. Hold a city-wide clean-up to awaken the public's attention to environmental hygiene and street cleanliness. 2. Continue to hold kitchen competitions. B. Original work. 1. Infant health competition. 2. Children's health speech competition. 3. Children's health drawing competition. 4. Children's health clothing show. 5. Mothers, although this Health Movement has the above-mentioned increase in original work, its funding will not be difficult because of this. It is good to invite cooperation from all parties according to the above reasons, so that spiritual and material pity can be obtained.</p>
<h3 id="e125">The Robbers in the Fish Bank Giant Robbery Case Are Found to Have Committed Another Robbery Case, and the Special Court Continues to Question Them Yesterday, the Robbers' Confessions Are Evasive <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The Tongrenchang Fish Bank on Xiaodongmen Street in the French Concession was robbed of a huge sum of money on the morning of the 10th of last month. Later, Inspector Jin Lilin, translator Li Xianyang, detectives Zhang Ziying, Qin Youyu, Tian Shiqing, detective Ma Yizhi, and others of the French Concession Police Station solved the case and arrested the robbers He Zhangsheng, also known as Xiao Mujian (31 years old, from Shaoxing), Fan Ada (28 years old, from Jiangyin), Dai Xiaosizi, also known as Yifa (31 years old, from Yancheng), Chen Xiaoerzi (28 years old, from Qingjiang), and the woman He Chen (28 years old, from Suzhou, her husband is He Qing'en, who is a dismissed Public Concession detective, recently arrested for theft and sentenced to seven years and six months by the First Special Court), and more than ten suspected accomplices. Stolen money of 1,298 yuan and several real and fake pistols were seized. After interrogation by the Special Court, the suspected accomplices who were not related to the case were released first, and He and others were remanded in custody for further verification of the situation at a later date, as reported previously. It is now known that the main culprit in the case, Qiu Bainian (from Ningbo), was an apprentice at the Baokang Qianzhuang at 505 Sichuan Road. He stopped working four years ago. Qiu knew about the relationship between Tongrenchang Fish Bank and Baokang Qianzhuang when he was at the bank, and he knew the details, so he colluded with He Zhangsheng, Fan Ali, and the fugitive Lao Pan and others to plan the robbery. After Qiu divided the stolen money, he deposited 1,000 yuan into the Bank of China. Two days later, he withdrew 990 yuan, leaving only 10 yuan. The deposit book has now been seized by the French Concession Police Station. However, Qiu fled without a trace and has not been captured. Yesterday morning, Judge Li Changnian of the Second Special Court came to the Criminal Court and ordered the arrested criminals to be brought in for further interrogation, and instructed lawyer Jin Xiongbo to defend the defendants. First, lawyer Yuan Jiahong of the Police Station stated the facts of the case, and said that it had been found that the first defendant, He Zhangsheng, had colluded with others on March 6 this year to rob Qin Jichen's house at 26 Zhizhong Lane, West Zilaishui Street, of more than 1,000 gold, and that the defendant Dai Xiaojiaozi had also committed the crime of receiving stolen goods, which was the robbery case in Yideli Lane, Lao Beidou Street. The defendants committed the crime of robbery with a gang of three or more people, and it is requested that they be punished in accordance with Article 330 of the Criminal Law, etc. When asked, He Zhangsheng confessed that he was invited by the fugitive Qiu Bainian to involve Fan Ada and the fugitive Lao Pan and others in the robbery. There was a pistol, which was borrowed by He Chen from Chen Xiaoerzi through Xiao Sizi. Afterwards, he gave them 720 yuan, and the civilians got 1,050 yuan, which was the stolen money seized in the case. He Chen confessed to lending the pistol, but did not dare to help with the robbery. Fan Ada confessed to helping with the robbery and got more than 500 yuan. Dai Xiaosizi confessed to borrowing the pistol from Chen Xiaoerzi on behalf of others. Chen Xiaoerzi said that the pistol was borrowed from a Geng surnamed person by a civilian, and he got 500 yuan afterwards. I got ten yuan. At first, I only knew about fighting, but I didn't know about robbery. The rest of the words were evasive. The court verified the confessions and ordered that they be interrogated again on the 19th. The defendants were still remanded in custody.</p>

<p>Twenty pistols and a radio were stolen from the Shanghai District Court's stolen goods depot. The details of the court's investigation have been recorded in previous reports. Yesterday, Chief Prosecutor Zhong of the court, considering the seriousness of the theft of important stolen goods from the stolen goods depot in the court, personally presided over the court session to investigate the case. Qian, the record clerk who has always been in charge of the stolen goods depot, was brought to court and personally interrogated for a long time. Because of Qian's responsibilities, he was ordered to be detained for further investigation. As for the vacancy of the acting director of the stolen goods depot, it is now temporarily filled by Judge Luo, the president of the court, who has temporarily appointed translator Ru Song from this court to act as the director.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Youxin Coal Company Undertakes Sales, Judgment in the Liujiang Coal Lawsuit, Shen Jinzhou Found Not Guilty of Defamation <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Youxin Coal Company claimed that Zhang Yanzhang, because of violating the resolutions of the joint meeting of executive and supervisory committees of the Coal Industry Association, refused to undertake the sale of products from the Liujiang Coal Mine illegally seized by the pseudo-autonomous region of eastern Hebei, and privately entered a large amount of Liujiang coal and sold it at a lower price. The Liujiang Company reported it to the association, and the association decided to notify the industry to break off economic relations with him. After Zhang Yanzhang of Youxin Company was sanctioned by the assembly, he filed a criminal lawsuit with the District Court of the First Special District against the chairman of the association Liu Hongsheng, standing committee members Mao Chunpu and Pan Yisan, executive committee members Chen Yutang and Wei Hongwen, and Liujiang manager Shen Jinzhou for defamation. Liu and others also hired lawyers Xu Shihao and Zuo Dedao to defend them. After repeated summons by the court, the Coal Industry Association submitted all the relevant documents of the association's punishment of Youxin Company and other industries for violating the resolution and privately selling the stolen Liujiang coal that had been seized, in order to prove that Zhang Yanzhang was only seeking private gain and disregarded public opinion. Zhang began to realize that he had become the target of public criticism, so at the beginning of the debate, he applied to withdraw the self-suit against all the defendants except Shen Jinzhou. The court approved the request. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ye held another court session and ruled that the main text of the judgment against Shen Jinzhou stated that Shen Jinzhou was not guilty. This case has been valued by the entire coal industry since it occurred. Whenever there was a court hearing, many people in the industry went to listen. Now it can be regarded as the end of a stage.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning around 2:00 AM, Yu Run Trading Company at No. 16 Xiaodongmen Main Street and Tong Ren Chang Trading Company at No. 13 dispatched employees Ye Shuping, Gu Cangsu, along with employees who were also brokers Dong Ziyuan, Gu Junchen, Chen Shengshan, Wang Yongkui, and Hu Jinglian. Together, they hired a car with Shanghai French Concession license plate No. 6835, owned by Wu Zhuofei of Xiaodongmen, to go to Dinghai Island. The car was driven by Wu's driver, named A Mao. Unexpectedly, at around 4:40 AM, the Yangshupu Police Station received a report from residents on Liping Road, stating that a car had suddenly been discovered floating on the water surface near the shore and requesting investigation. After receiving the information, the police station immediately dispatched detectives. They confirmed that there was indeed a car floating on the water surface, with license plate No. 6835. However, there were no passengers in the car, and the driver was also missing. It was concluded that they must have sunk to the bottom. Immediately, water ghosts and boatmen were hired to search and salvage the bodies. Soon, two bodies were recovered, but their identities were unknown. After repeated inquiries, the faces of the two bodies were identified as Ye Shuping, an employee of Yu Run Trading Company, and Hu Jinglian. The other five people and the driver were still missing. As the current was very strong at the time, it was unknown whether they had drifted elsewhere. Detectives then summoned ambulances and first transported the two bodies to the hospital for examination before sending them to the mortuary. Meanwhile, efforts were made to raise the floating car ashore. Before long, Sun Guchen, the owner of Tong Ren Chang Trading Company, and relatives and friends of the victims also received the tragic news. In the misty rain at dawn, they drove to the scene, weeping bitterly by the river, a heartrending sight. Sun Guchen personally requested the police station to continue sending water ghosts to search for the remaining six bodies on the spot. By that night, the body of Gu Cangsu was recovered, but the whereabouts of the others were still unknown. Among the eight victims, only Ye Shuping was from Jiashan, 37 years old. The other six were all from Pudong. According to various speculations, the cause of the accident was likely due to the driver, A Mao, being unfamiliar with the route at the time. The police station is still investigating the matter, while Yu Run and Tong Ren Chang are handling the aftermath. Pig merchants view this as a dangerous route, leading to a decrease in sources.</p>

<p>The Jiangbei pig boat Jin Heli, carrying 238 live pigs from Sun Yuanji Pig Company to Shanghai for sale, was sailing on the Qixu Port sea area at approximately 1:00 AM on the 9th of this month when a Chongming boat sailed towards it. Inside the boat were 17 or 18 pirates armed with several rifles and two Mauser pistols. They fired a warning shot and ordered the boat to stop. The pirates then swarmed aboard, locked the crew and pig merchants in the cabin, and began looting 92 live pigs, 10 legal tender dollars, clothing, bedding, oil, and rice. Before leaving, they also destroyed the boat's sailing equipment. The pirate boat then sailed north. The pig boat arrived in Wusong yesterday, where the experienced foreman reported the incident to the Shanghai Pig Industry Association's Wusong office. The office then requested the Third District Water Police to investigate and apprehend the criminals and recover the stolen goods. It is reported that the Pig Industry Association held a meeting because pig boats have been repeatedly robbed this year, but the authorities have not solved a single case, leading to more rampant piracy. Pig merchants view this as a dangerous route. If effective protection measures are not taken quickly, it will affect business and have significant consequences. After discussion, it was decided to send a letter to the Third District Water Police requesting a strict investigation of the pirates' whereabouts and to submit a petition to the municipal government requesting effective protection measures to safeguard the pig industry and facilitate shipping.</p>

<p>Since the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs started organizing group weddings, it has felt that the attire of the brides and grooms during the wedding ceremony was quite inconsistent, making it insufficient to create a grand spectacle and contradicting the purpose of the New Life Movement's "uniformity." Therefore, it specially designated Kaili Silk and Satin Company, established by the Meiya Silk Weaving Factory on Jing'an Temple Road, to exclusively produce the group wedding attire, in order to show uniformity. After the group wedding was promoted and implemented by the Bureau of Social Affairs, other legal entities also followed suit, and the sales of wedding attire soared. Lili Standard Silk and Satin Company, located next to Kaili, published an advertisement in the newspaper in October of last year, stating that it would provide free production of Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs-approved blue robe and black jacket standard wedding attire. At that time, Kaili believed that since it had been designated by the Bureau of Social Affairs to produce the attire first, Lili should not imitate its name and filed a petition with the Bureau of Social Affairs requesting a prompt cessation. Subsequently, the bureau issued an instruction to warn Lili Company. Therefore, Kaili posted the instruction in its window and added the words "When purchasing Meiya standard wedding attire, please beware of imitation and inferior goods" to the instruction. Lili's manager, Lin Zhixiang, saw this and believed that Kaili's actions publicly damaged Lili's reputation. Therefore, he hired a lawyer to file a criminal self-accusation against Cai Shengbai, the general manager of Meiya, and Gao Shiheng, the deputy general manager and manager of Kaili, in the First Special District Local Court, requesting punishment according to law, and attaching a civil suit requesting the defendant to publish an apology in the newspaper. During the first court hearing, the defendants were not all present, so the hearing was postponed until the afternoon before yesterday. Judge Yang Qianchang interrogated the defendants again. Both Cai and Gao appeared in court with their defense lawyer, Chen Churu. During the hearing, both parties did not dispute the fact that the defendant's company posted the Bureau of Social Affairs' instruction and added the words "beware of imitation" to the instruction paper. What needed to be investigated was whether these actions constituted the crime of defamation. The lawyers from both sides then debated the point. The plaintiff's lawyers, Xue Jiaqi and others, stated that the defendant's actions constituted deliberate defamation and requested the court to rule in accordance with the plaintiff's claims. The defendant's lawyers argued that the Bureau of Social Affairs' instruction was equivalent to a trademark registration document, and companies and shops commonly displayed trademark registration documents in their stores. Therefore, the defendant's display of the instruction was not illegal, and the added words "beware of imitation" did not specifically refer to the plaintiff. Therefore, since the documents were not forged and the defamation was unfounded, the court should declare the defendants innocent. Judge Yang then ordered both parties to withdraw and await the verdict next Monday.</p>

<p>The Western-style house at No. 6, Masnan Road, French Concession, is the residence of Shao Wangjing, the wife of Shao Lizhi, the current chairman of Gansu Province and member of the Central Committee. Wang has a younger brother, Wang Shugen, 28 years old. On the 9th of this month, he asked his sister Wangjing for a loan of 200 dollars but was unsuccessful and bore a grudge. Unexpectedly, at 8:30 AM yesterday morning, Wang Shugen gathered robbers Hu Yulin, Zhang Baoqing, and Gao Fu, armed with a fake pistol and a small knife, and led them to Shao's residence to commit robbery. Wang stood outside, directing Hu and others to enter the house to rob. The maid saw them and shouted "Robbers!" The robbers panicked and fled, dropping the fake pistol in the courtyard of No. 7 next door and the small knife outside the back door of Shao's house. They fled in different directions. Nearby police officers and French Concession inspectors Jiang Futian, Wang Rusong, Zhang Daorong, and detective Liu Jinrong arrived and gave chase. They captured robber Hu Yulin (23 years old, from Fujian) at the intersection of Avenue Joffre. Zhang, Gao, and Wang Shugen escaped without a trace. The detectives took Hu to the victim's house for identification and recovered the fake pistol and knife, then took him back to the police station. Under interrogation, Hu confessed that the fake pistol was held by Gao Fu, who was still at large. The police chief ordered him to be detained and ordered the original detectives to continue to apprehend the escaped robbers and bring them to justice.</p>

<p>Also Discovering Impersonation and Abetment; Wang Chuandong and Two Others Released on Bail Pending Judgment</p>
<p>Yan Zhaofa and Zhang Heshang, who worked as waiters at the No. 4 Detachment of the U.S. Marine Corps barracks on Chengdu Road, conspired on the night of April 21 to steal a diamond ring worth 1,500 yuan belonging to the head of the detachment. The next day, they took it to Lihua Silver Shop at No. 120 Hengfeng Road, Zhabei, to inquire about the value and authenticity of the diamond ring. Wang Chuandong, the shop owner from Nanjing, and Dong Songnian, a partner from Shaoxing, examined the ring and determined that it was only worth eight yuan. Yan and Zhang felt that the value was too low, so they took it away and pawned it at Yuanfeng Pawnshop on Xin Zha Road for 50 national currency dollars. They then returned to Lihua Silver Shop and stated that they had pawned it for 50 yuan, and showed the pawn ticket. Wang Chuandong and Dong Songnian immediately offered 18 yuan to buy the pawn ticket. Wang then sent Wu Zhongyuan from Suzhou to Yuanfeng Pawnshop to redeem the diamond ring. Later, the Xin Zha Police Station discovered the case. Chinese detective Ding Huaguo arrested the two thieves, Yan and Zhang, and sent them to the First Special Court. After interrogation, in addition to punishing the thieves, the police determined that Wang Chuandong, the owner of Lihua Silver Shop, his partner Dong Songnian, and Wu Zhongyuan were suspected of conspiring to receive stolen goods. The police station filed charges according to the law. The Special Court once summoned them for questioning. Wang and Wu claimed to be ill and did not appear. Only Dong Songnian appeared in court, but Dong concealed his own name and impersonated Wang Chuandong. After Judge Ye Shengchao discovered this, he believed that Dong had impersonated someone and ordered the case to be postponed. Dong Songnian was ordered to be handed over to the police station for investigation. The police station concluded its investigation, determining that Dong Songnian not only had impersonated someone, but Wang Chuandong also had abetted the crime. Therefore, yesterday morning, when Judge Ye continued the hearing of the case, police lawyer Qian Xunjiu, in addition to charging Wang, Dong, and Zhang with the crime of receiving stolen goods in accordance with Article 349, Section 3 of the Criminal Law, also charged Wang and Dong with the crimes of abetment and concealment of fugitives in accordance with Article 29 and Article 164, Section 2 of the Criminal Law. He then stated the above circumstances and requested a verdict according to law. Wang Chuandong confessed to buying the pawn ticket for 18 yuan and sending Wu Zhongyuan to Yuanfeng Pawnshop to redeem the ring. However, the person who came to sell the ring was wearing Western clothes and claimed that the diamond ring was bought for 120 yuan and now wanted to sell it. Wang said that Lihua Silver Shop specialized in redeeming pawn tickets, so he offered eight yuan for the gold in the ring. As for the diamond, he did not know its authenticity, so he let the person take it away. But the deal did not go through. Later, the man in Western clothes came back, so he offered 18 yuan to buy the pawn ticket. He said that he was sick during the previous hearing, so he had Dong Songnian represent him. Dong and Wu confessed to the same events. After the defendant's lawyer rose to defend, the court ordered Wang Chuandong to pay 3,000 yuan bail, and Dong and Wu to each pay 2,000 yuan bail, to await the verdict next Tuesday.</p>

<h3 id="e141">Shanghai's Glass Manufacturing Industry - Editor <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>(Excerpts from the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Overview, Part 24)</p>
<p>Overview – Glass manufacturing was invented in China long ago. However, all production was done by hand, and the technology was very backward. In the 29th year of the Guangxu reign (Qing Dynasty), Su Ren Zhang Jian (also known as Zhang Ji Zhi), Xu Jiu Xiang, and others raised 830,000 taels of silver to establish the modern Yaoxu Glass Factory in Jiangbei. However, due to a lack of experience and poor management, it closed in the 2nd year of the Xuantong reign. Glass factories in Shanghai started a little later than Yaoxu, but have a history of over twenty years. Renhe Glass Factory was established in the first year of the Republic of China (1912). In the fourth year of the Republic of China (1915), Chinese businessmen bought the Japanese-owned Zhonghua Glass Factory and renamed it Zhonghua Fengji Glass Factory. In the ninth and tenth years of the Republic of China (1920-21), the Gongyi Glass Factory and Shanghai Glass Co., Ltd. followed. Subsequently, the Pudong No. 1 Glass Factory, Xiechang Glass Factory, Guangming Electrical Appliances Co., Ltd., and Tonghe Glass Factory were established. The industry flourished in the sixteenth and seventeenth years of the Republic of China (1927-28), with a total of more than thirty companies. After the eighteenth year of the Republic of China (1929), the industry suffered a setback due to the impact of expensive gold and cheap silver. The Shanghai war caused even more severe damage, with Renhe, Zhonghua Fengji, Shanghai, and several other factories being burned down. After the war ended, the industry revived, with new factories such as Yeye, Jinghua, and Zhongyang Chemical emerging, all on a considerable scale. This is a general overview of the evolution of the glass industry in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The types of glass products are numerous, broadly divided into flat glass, optical glass, chemical glassware, and decorative glass. However, most of the glass factories in Shanghai suffer from insufficient capital and lack of precision in their technology. The majority of their products are still made of material, especially daily necessities such as bottles, cups, jars, and lamps. Currently, only Yaohua manufactures flat glass. Therefore, China still relies on imports to supply flat glass, which is something we should distinguish.</p>
<p>The main raw materials for manufacturing glass and material are glass sand, saltpeter, lime, fluorite, manganese powder, soda ash, sulfuric acid, and other substances. The local factories mainly obtain these materials from inland China or overseas. Mineral materials such as glass sand, lime, and fluorite can be supplied from inland China. However, manganese powder relies on the Japanese, and soda ash is mostly produced by Underdown, a British company. Chinese people still have difficulty independently producing this chemical industry raw material. Therefore, in terms of the glass industry, Chinese people still need to work hard to increase production, reduce the import of foreign goods, and further seek self-sufficiency in chemical industry raw materials. Only in this way can we seek the prosperity of the national glass industry.</p>
<p>Imports of Foreign Glass – China still needs to rely on the import of foreign glass products to meet the needs of the domestic market, as mentioned earlier. Now, the import volume, types, and sources will be described one by one for the reference of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>There are many types of imported glass products, among which ordinary window glass sheets account for the largest proportion. Shanghai has the most ports for importing various types of glass, accounting for more than 60% of the total national import volume. Now, according to customs reports, the figures for the past three years are listed below (unit: 1,000 Customs Gold Units):</p>
<p>In terms of countries, the largest importers are Czechoslovakia, Germany, and Belgium. Czechoslovakia is particularly worth mentioning. Czechoslovakia is a small country in Europe that Chinese people have not paid much attention to, but its glass and glass products are quite popular in China. According to Czech statistics, its imports of glassware to China in 1930 were 6.085 thousand crowns (Czech currency), and in 1934 it could still maintain 7.128 thousand crowns, without declining with the general shrinkage of China's import trade, which shows its popularity. The "Inwald" trademark glassware displayed in major stores in Shanghai is produced in Czechoslovakia. Furthermore, the glass utensils in the Paramount Ballroom and the International Hotel also come from Czechoslovakia, which shows the close relationship between Czech glass products and Shanghai's industry and commerce.</p>
<p>Recent Situation of Major Factories in Shanghai – According to the Shanghai Yearbook (1935 edition), there are a total of 78 glass manufacturing factories in China, with 31 in Shanghai. The capital of the whole country is 3,019,000 yuan, and Shanghai accounts for 607,000 yuan. The output of the whole country is 4,992,000, and Shanghai accounts for 3,210,000. Among the 31 factories in Shanghai, 18 have a capital of more than 10,000 yuan, and the remaining 13 have a capital of only more than 1,000 yuan. The situations of the main factories (manufacturing glassware) are described separately below:</p>
<p>1.  Zhongyang Chemical Glass Factory – This factory was organized by Xu Xinzhi and others, the former director of Ruihe Crucible Factory. It was established in August 1934 with a paid-up capital of 50,000 yuan. The factory is located at No. 1332 Pingliang Road, covering an area of 2.8 mu. It is a rented land with buildings. There is a large stove in the factory, with new equipment and more than 50 employees. The distribution office was originally in Hua'efang, but this spring it moved to No. 566 Sanma Road due to business development. Its products are mainly medical and chemical glassware, supplemented by household utensils. The factory's products are excellent and have a wide sales network, almost unable to meet the demand. Last year's total turnover reached more than 100,000 yuan, and it may be able to increase by another half in the future.</p>
<p>2.  Zhonghua Glass Factory – This factory is solely operated by Zheng Zhonghan with a capital of 30,000 yuan. It was established in July 1932. The factory is located at No. 957 Tangshan Road, specializing in the production of various types of bottles and various glass products. The factory building and base are all its own property. There are three kilns built inside, costing about 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Various bottle molds are worth about 25,000 to 26,000 yuan. The factory's business is mainly based in Shanghai, and it has connections with various cosmetics manufacturers, candy factories, and wineries. Therefore, its business is quite good. Last year's turnover reached 180,000 yuan, with a profit of 20,000 yuan. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e142">How to Overcome the "Economic National Crisis"? <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>Only by Developing Domestic Products Can We Revive National Industry</p>
<p>Everyone knows that China is currently experiencing the most severe national crisis, especially the economic crisis. Due to years of dumping of foreign goods, the surge in import surpluses, and the rolling outflow of huge amounts of foreign exchange every year, rural areas have gone bankrupt, industry and commerce have declined, and the tide of recession has swept the country. The weakness of the purchasing power of the majority of the people has reached its extreme. The collapse of the entire national economy has entered the final stage, and how to overcome the economic national crisis has become the most urgent and important issue for workers today. The future survival of the people of the whole country is only tied to overcoming the economic national crisis.</p>
<p>However, the painful fact tells us that until recently, the "economic national crisis" has not been eased due to the growing decline of our national livelihood. On the contrary, it has become more serious recently due to the intensified aggression of foreign forces. The rampant smuggling in North China and South China, and the Northwest market, after the completion of the highway, the domestic goods industry was about to develop, but foreign goods took the lead and dumped them on a large scale, which greatly affected the sales of domestic goods industry. In particular, the presence of smuggled goods everywhere not only leaves no room for domestic goods, but also affects the difficulty of collecting accounts receivable and the return of inventory. It simply whips the domestic goods industry to the point where there is no way to go.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can know that to overcome the economic national crisis, we can only develop domestic products. The specific implementation of developing domestic products is not effective by empty slogans. We must have a clear understanding of the truth of the economic national crisis and its main causes. Then we can prescribe the right medicine, remove the obstacles that prevent the progress of domestic goods, especially prevent smuggling, and expel all kinds of foreign economic oppression. All sovereignty must be independent before we can overcome the economic national crisis and solve the problem of domestic goods development.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must recognize that the development and prosperity of the entire industrial and commercial sector is being shackled and restricted by the economic national crisis. Our future way out must be to break free from these shackles and remove these fetters before we can restore our economic freedom.</p>
<p>At present, our economic national crisis is indeed serious. But we must not be pessimistic or discouraged. We demand national survival, so we must overcome the economic national crisis. To overcome the economic national crisis, we must develop domestic products and revive national industry. The government and the people must work together, unite and work together to achieve our final goal and victory.</p>

The reports in the newspapers that day were slightly different. As a reporter who participated in the entertainment, the conversation was very satisfactory. I dare to describe the opinions of the women's world and the expectations of the reporter as a notification to comrades who are concerned about the cause of domestic goods:</p>
<p>Leaders in the women's world believe that the progress of domestic goods in recent years is commendable. If the women's world can use domestic goods for their needs in clothing, food, housing, and use, they will do their best to use them. They also said that their clothing is uniformly made of domestic silk and satin, and Cai Junsheng of Meiya was present to confirm it. They also said that children's clothing is made of domestic fabrics, and Sanyou Hongxin is their main customer. They also said that children love their country from the bottom of their hearts and are influenced by education. If parents are careless and buy non-domestic silk and satin, they will declare to their parents that they do not want to wear them. From this point alone, the future of China is very promising. One of the speeches by Mrs. Hua encouraged domestic goods manufacturers to work hard to improve their products so that the women's world would rely on domestic goods for all their clothing, food, housing, and use. She also hoped that they would come up with their own ideas, preserve the inherent beauty of China, and not compete in Westernization and imitate irrelevant patterns. Her words were earnest and sincere, and the domestic goods industry should follow them faithfully. Here, the reporter has three thoughts:</p>
<p>The general women's world has shifted its atmosphere and unanimously tends to buy domestic goods. Therefore, anyone who calls themselves a domestic goods company will be like a marketplace, which is a satisfactory effect of promoting domestic goods for ten years.</p>
<p>The heart of children to love and use domestic goods, in addition to the power of family education, plus the power of school education, its momentum is even greater and stronger. When these people grow up to be masters and housewives, their enthusiasm for using domestic goods is really unstoppable.</p>
<p>The domestic goods industry is the manufacturer, and the women's world is the user. If the manufacturing and user parties can be open and honest, and often contact each other to create an atmosphere of harmony, and often exchange opinions and communicate feelings, then the development of the domestic goods industry cannot be described in words.</p>
<p>If everything can be met with sincerity and discussed with sincerity, then any estrangement can be eliminated. Since the women's world can sincerely support domestic goods and promote domestic goods so much, then even if there are one or two points of difference in consciousness or misunderstandings by intermediaries, do not hold grudges in your heart, so as not to discourage a piece of enthusiasm. The reporter met with Ms. Li Zhenhua, Wang Ruizhu, and Ouyang Jun yesterday, and they spoke highly of the importance of the women's world promoting domestic goods, which is to unite female comrades to engage in the women's world using domestic goods movement. All parties have the same mentality and feel the same need. Although the methods are different, they all lead to the same goal, with the aim of developing domestic goods and eliminating import surpluses. This is a very good phenomenon in the domestic goods industry.</p>
<h3 id="e144">A Short Account of Visiting the Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Factory to Manufacture National Party Flags <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Ran</p>
<p>On May 7th, the General Bureau for the Production and Sale of Party and National Flags invited people from all walks of life to visit the Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Factory to see how the Party and National Flags are manufactured. I went to the factory with Mr. Xu Caicheng and Mr. Ren Jinping for a visit, which took two hours to complete the work of spinning, weaving, dyeing, and finishing. The factory is divided into five departments: The first is the spinning department, which spins cotton into cotton yarn. It has machines for blending cotton, unpacking, transporting cotton, opening cotton, cleaning cotton, carding cotton, drawing cotton, roving, and spinning. There are fifty-two Toyoda-style spinning frames with 15,000 spindles. The scale is very large. The second is the weaving department, which weaves cotton yarn into cloth. The weaving machines are all Toyoda-style, which are highly efficient and can produce more than 3,000 bolts of cloth per day. The third is the bleaching department, which bleaches the cloth. There are more than ten bleaching machines, which are very beautiful and durable. The fourth is the dyeing department, which first dyes the bleached cloth with a base color. The fifth is the printing department, which officially prints the dyed cloth into the colors of the Party and National Flags, and then washes it with steam and water to clean it, and then uses finishing work to make the color bright and the cloth flat. All the raw materials in the factory, except for some pigments, are all domestic raw materials. Mr. Xu has a wealth of experience in the textile industry and gave instructions one by one. He gave detailed instructions on the work of winding yarn, warping yarn, sizing yarn, beaming, drawing-in, and inserting weft. The equipment in the printing department is even more ingenious. According to Mr. Xu, the efficiency of Toyoda spinning machines is 30% higher than that of American machines and 10% higher than that of British machines. It is believable that the Japanese have gone from imitation to creation. There are about 1,300 workers, who are very energetic. Within ten hours, they can print 15,000 yards of Party and National Flags. The daily production can be 200,000 flags if they are No. 1 to No. 3 flags, 80,000 flags if they are No. 4 flags. If they are No. 5 and No. 6 flags, they can produce more than 10,000 flags. The flags of No. 7, No. 8, No. 9, and No. 4 are all around several thousand. The machines used are the fastest and most efficient, so the production is particularly high and the management is flexible. According to statistics, each Party and National Flag goes through 46 processes from cotton to flying in the air. Mr. Zhang Zilian said that this Party and National Flag has three characteristics: It never fades, It is a whole piece of fabric, and It is made of domestic raw materials. My colleagues and I were very satisfied after visiting and took notes.</p>
<h3 id="e145">New Uses for Tung Oil <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Linchang</p>
<p>Tung oil is a special product of China, and there are names such as Sichuan Tung, Zheng Tung, and Zhejiang Tung, which are distinguished by their place of origin. Chinese people mostly use it to decorate houses and utensils and to paint ships. Because tung oil has the function of resisting rain and water seepage, general ships are soaked in water all year round. Without the protection of tung oil paint, they are very easy to rot. As for exporting it to foreign countries, it was mostly used in industrial products in the past, and later it also occupied an important position in military products. For example, the exteriors of airplanes and submarines must be lubricated with tung oil to be considered strong. Unexpectedly, in recent years, foreigners have discovered a special use for this substance in the military. Because soldiers on the front line, after each bullet is fired, the barrel of the gun will heat up. If you want to continue to use it, the heat will not dissipate in a moment, which will affect shooting. If you apply tung oil, you can avoid this problem. Recently, the world situation has become increasingly tense, and countries are preparing for war very urgently. Therefore, the export of tung oil from China has increased sharply, and in the past two days, it has occupied the first place in export goods.</p>

<p>(Havas Agency, Berlin, 11th) The government recently cast a large bell for the Olympic stadium, which was suspended this morning atop the stadium gate tower (tower height 76 meters). This bell is made of 14,000 kilograms of pure steel, with a diameter of 2.80 meters and a height of 2.70 meters. One side is cast with a giant eagle, its claws holding an athlete, and the other side is cast with the Brandenburg Gate and a chariot drawn by four horses. When the 11th Olympic World Games open on August 1st of this year, this giant bell will be rung to symbolize the call to gather the youth.</p>

<p>Councilor Dai Jitao of the Examination Yuan, after being appointed as the government representative to participate in the World Games, and arriving in Shanghai from Beijing the morning before yesterday, was honored by the four groups of the city's National Arts Association, Jingwu Athletic Association, Chinese Athletic Association, and Chinese Wushu Association.

A reporter from Datong News Agency provides the following details:</p>
<p>List of Banquet Attendees: President Dai, Chu Minyi, Zhang Zhijiang, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Shen Siliang, Yang Jingcheng, Xu Zhiyi, Tong Zhongyi, Zhu Lianxiang, Wu Jianquan, Wu Yun-chu, Fu Yingguang, Zhu Ligong, Zhang Qidong, Lao Boshu, Weng Guoxun, Wei Langxuan, Weng Yaohong, Hao Ming, Meng Jianyan, Weng Kangjian, Qian Weiju, Ye Yushu, Zhu Wenwei, and foreign guest Kod and others, over thirty people.</p>

<p>Chu Minyi's Speech: After taking their seats, Chairman Chu Minyi gave a speech, stating that national arts are extremely important to physical education and should be vigorously promoted to achieve universal participation. This time, President Dai is leading the athletes abroad to participate in the World Games, and he will definitely promote national arts and win glory for the country. The national arts groups in Shanghai express their warm welcome and use this banquet as a send-off.</p>
<p>Dai's Reply: After Chu's speech, President Dai gave a reply, stating that in recent years, our country has been plagued by communist bandits internally and pressured by international restrictions externally. The people's thoughts are often stuck in the realm of expediency and complacency. The only way to save the situation is to cultivate a healthy physique. Only with a healthy physique can there be a healthy personality. National arts is the only way to strengthen the body and is also our country's inherent sport. It can also be said to be our country's national spirit. Looking at the reasons for the strength of various countries, they are all achieved through the combination of literary and military aspects. Therefore, our country should also implement an education that combines literary and military aspects as the spirit of the nation. Although participating in the World Games this time cannot compete with countries that are politically advanced and have made rapid progress in sports, it is of great value to take this opportunity to show the national spirit of our country. The banquet ended at around 9 PM, with the host and guests enjoying themselves thoroughly and taking a group photo before dispersing.</p>

If he fails, then Zhou and Bao will have to compete again, because Bao was defeated by Bai Nashuo. However, whether today's game can be played depends on whether the court can be used.</p>

<h3 id="e158">The Education of Northeastern China Has Already Been Enslaved; The Puppet Organization Implements Heinous Methods <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) According to travelers newly arrived from the Northeast, regarding the general situation of education in the Northeast under the rule of the puppet organization, the following is recorded:</p>
<p>Educational Administration and School Organization</p>
<p>The highest educational administrative organ of the puppet organization is the Ministry of Education and Culture, which has one Secretary-General and one Vice-Minister. It is divided into three divisions: General Affairs, Academic Affairs, and Etiquette. The heads of the General Affairs and Academic Affairs divisions are filled by certain Japanese individuals. The General Affairs Division has four sections: Secretariat, Investigation, General Affairs, and Documentation. The Academic Affairs Division is divided into Specialized and General sections. The Etiquette Division has sections for Social Education and Religion. Additionally, there is an Editorial Committee and Inspectors. In each provincial Department of Education, there is a Director, with divisions below including General Affairs, Science, Academic Affairs, Etiquette, and Inspectorate. The Academic Affairs Division is further divided into School Education and Social Education sections. The section chiefs of General Affairs, Academic Affairs, and the Inspectorate are all certain Japanese individuals. Inspectors and staff members are a mix of certain Japanese individuals and Chinese. Each secondary school has one Principal and one Director for each of the following: Academic Affairs, Discipline, General Affairs, Health, Library, Dormitory Affairs, and Grade Level. The Directors of Academic Affairs and General Affairs are certain Japanese individuals. Recently, many Discipline Directors have also been filled by certain Japanese individuals. The principals of each experimental middle school are also certain Japanese individuals. Each elementary school has an additional Vice-Principal, who is a certain Japanese individual.</p>
<p>For any important instructions to various schools, the Department of Education has the relevant Japanese section chief summon the relevant Japanese director of each school to personally impart the necessary information. If schools have any requests for the Department of Education, the relevant Japanese director directly discusses it with the relevant Japanese section chief or the Director of the Department. The Director and Principal sign and stamp the documents. For matters of confidentiality, even the signing and endorsement procedures are omitted. The relationship between the Ministry of Education and Culture and the Department of Education is the same. All supplies for the schools are distributed by the Department of Education, and the hiring and firing of teachers and staff are also decided by the Department of Education.</p>
<p>Educational Goals</p>
<p>The educational goal of the puppet organization is "loyalty to the monarch and forbearance" for boys' schools, and "virtuous mothers and good wives" for girls' schools. For both boys' and girls' schools, the common goals are to understand the spirit of nation-building, realize Wangdao (the Way of the Benevolent King), and promote amity between the puppet state and certain Japanese individuals and mutual coexistence and co-prosperity.</p>
<p>Schools at All Levels</p>
<p>According to the above-mentioned educational goals, all colleges and universities in the Northeast from before the September 18th Incident are naturally abolished, and middle schools and demonstration schools are also abolished or merged. Vocational schools are reorganized so that the highest aspiration of the general Northeast youth is to be trained as lower-level technicians. Kindergartens and elementary schools are actively expanded because instilling pro-certain Japanese individuals ideas and enslaving the youth are considered most thorough when starting from kindergarten and elementary school. Citizen Party Ideology is eliminated from schools at all levels and replaced with ethics. The number of hours for English and mathematics is reduced, while the teaching of certain Japanese language is increased. Failing certain Japanese language results in failing the grade. History and geography textbooks in middle schools use newly compiled puppet state history and puppet state geography. Other subjects use old textbooks with deletions and alterations. Elementary school textbooks now all use newly compiled ones. Certain Japanese language classes in all schools are taught by certain Japanese individuals. The Department of Education also hires many Japanese teachers for various subjects to serve as instructors in each county. In addition to extolling the amity between the puppet state and certain Japanese individuals, mutual coexistence and co-prosperity, and the true meaning of Wangdao and nation-building, the following training methods are implemented in the discipline of all levels of schools: (A) Singing the national anthem and paying respects to the Imperial Palace: During morning exercises each month, the students and teachers first raise the puppet state flag and sing the puppet state national anthem, and then pay respects to the puppet state Imperial Palace. (B) Viewing the Imperial Portrait and Reading the Imperial Rescript: In the auditorium of each school, a photograph of the rebellious Pu Yi is hung, referred to as the "Imperial Portrait," and two types of "Imperial Rescripts" are treasured: one is the enthronement rescript, and the other is the rescript on a visit to certain Japanese individuals. The content is the golden rule that the "puppet state and certain Japanese individuals are inseparable," instructing all subjects to thoroughly understand, comply with, and follow the order. At all important ceremonies or meetings, the Imperial Portrait must be respected first, and the "Imperial Rescript" must be read aloud. (C) Imperial Rescript Writing Contest: To arouse students' attention to the Imperial Rescript, an Imperial Rescript writing contest is held for all students in "Manchukuo." Each school selects ten students to participate in the preliminary round in the provincial capital. As a result, each school selects two students to go to "Xinjing" to participate in the final round. (D) Organizing Nation-Building Propaganda Teams and Appeasement Teams: To popularize the theory of amity, coexistence, and co-prosperity and deeply root it in the hearts of the people of the puppet "Manchukuo," Nation-Building Propaganda Teams and Appeasement Teams are organized to give lectures on Wangdao, the Concordance Policy, and the essential points of the inseparability of the puppet state and certain Japanese individuals in various places and schools. (E) Honoring Confucius: In provinces and counties with Confucian temples, efforts are made to repair the Confucian temples. In places without Confucian temples, proposals are made to build them, using Confucius's Great Harmony doctrine and the ideas of ruler-ruler and subject-subject to seduce the youth and make them loyal to the puppet organization. (F) Soliciting Paintings to Promote National Conditions: In order to enable the general public to understand the political situation of the puppet organization and foster their awareness of the puppet state, the Jilin Department of Education issued a notice to teachers, staff, and students of all schools last autumn to solicit paintings to promote national conditions.</p>
<p>Policy on Studying Abroad</p>
<p>For students from the Northeast who went abroad before the September 18th Incident with government funding to study in Europe and the United States, the certain Japanese legations and consulates in the host countries reissued tuition fees and advised them to return to their home country. Those who complied were given travel expenses to return home, otherwise, the tuition fees were discontinued. Afterwards, no students were sent to Europe or the United States. Those who wished to pursue further studies were only allowed to study in certain Japanese individuals. Examinations for studying in certain Japanese individuals were divided into the following categories: (A) Selecting middle school teachers to study for one year, with a monthly allowance of 60 yuan. (B) Selecting high school graduates, with monthly tuition ranging from 20 to 50 yuan, depending on the level of the school they entered and the location of their family. (C) Selecting junior high school students. The puppet ambassador to certain Japanese individuals, Ding Shiyuan, suggested that students who are a little older have firm ideas that are not easily assimilated, which hinders the work of concordance between the puppet state and certain Japanese individuals. Therefore, he suggested that students under the age of fifteen be selected to study in certain Japanese individuals. This proposal was adopted, so recently there have been many students from outside the customs around the age of fifteen studying in certain Japanese individuals, with a monthly tuition fee of 20 to 25 yuan. (D) Selecting elementary school teachers to visit certain Japanese individuals in batches, to increase their pro-certain Japanese individuals ideas and make them loyal to enslaved education. (E) Ordering the children of puppet officials to study in certain Japanese individuals. In order to control the Northeast students studying in certain Japanese individuals, the old managers of various provinces were abolished, and a school affairs section was added to the puppet embassy in certain Japanese individuals to specialize in matters related to international students. A certain Japanese individual was appointed as the section chief, and students from Kwantung Province (Dalian) and South Manchuria Medical College and South Manchuria Public School were used to organize groups such as the Youth League, the Shenshui Association, and the Hometown Association to monitor the students' actions under the guise of connecting feelings and prevent them from interacting with students from the mainland provinces.</p>
<p>Restricting Students from Entering the Customs</p>
<p>During the summer vacation of the 24th year, the Jilin Provincial Department of Education of the puppet government convened a meeting of parents of students studying inside the customs. The attendees were mostly civil servants. The meeting was called a meeting, but in reality, it forced parents to recall their children studying inside the customs and change to studying in certain Japanese individuals. Except for those who were about to graduate, all others had to comply. In order to implement this policy, the Ministry of Education and Culture of the puppet government planned to change all schools in the country to start in the spring, so that they would not be connected to the entrance examinations of schools inside the customs. Heilongjiang Province has already implemented this starting this spring. Currently, the puppet education departments of various provinces have received instructions to investigate international students and pay special attention to those seeking education inside the customs.</p>
<p>Screening and Training of Teachers</p>
<p>In addition to managing school affairs and training students, the Japanese staff and teachers in various schools in the Northeast also observe the actions and attitudes of Chinese teachers and staff. The Department of Education often asks Chinese teachers and staff with clear minds to write articles or give speeches on the topic of "Impressions of the New Nation" in order to determine the thoughts of each employee and decide whether to keep them. The Ministry of Education and Culture uses winter and summer vacations to conduct examinations and evaluations of primary and secondary school teachers. The most important item in the examination is the "Spirit of Nation-Building," and the remaining subjects are formal. The Ministry of Education and Culture of the puppet government established a teacher training institute in Nanling, Changchun, and selected current teachers and staff from all over the country to study "Spirit of Nation-Building," "Domestic Affairs," "International Relations," and "Economic Education." The first phase of training lasted for three months, from October 1 to the end of December of the 24th year.</p>
<p>Checking Books</p>
<p>In the winter of the 24th year, the Police Department of Heilongjiang Province of the puppet government notified the Department of Education that all publications of public and private schools must be sent to the department for approval before they can be printed, otherwise they would be prohibited from being printed. In various places outside the customs, books related to national justice or national humiliation had long been burned. In the winter of the 23rd year, the chief of the Social Education Section of the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Education of the puppet government inspected the books in the province's libraries and people's education centers, and all records related to the "spirit of martial valor" were cut out. Reviewing textbooks is the top priority of the puppet government. In addition to the Editorial Committee of the Ministry of Education and Culture, the organs responsible for planning and implementing this include the Certain Manchurian Culture Association of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the Fengtian Provincial Youth Education Association, and the South Manchuria Education Association, which are also engaged in the editing of textbooks.</p>
<p>Suppressing Schools and Educators Suspected of Anti-Manchu Activities</p>
<p>The Fengtian Provincial Department of Education of the puppet government believed that anti-Manchu elements had infiltrated the Private Shuren Girls' Academy in Dabeiguan and were spreading anti-Manchu ideas. Therefore, it thoroughly investigated schools and private schools in the city. As a result, 11 middle schools, 11 elementary schools, 18 technical schools, 13 language schools, and 65 private schools were closed down. The puppet organization took last November as a period of major inspection. Many residents were severely punished for communicating with people inside the customs, so everyone was in danger. When the patriotic movement of students inside the customs arose, a large-scale literary dragnet was cast, and 17 educators in Jilin Province were arrested, 12 people in the Changchun education community were arrested, and the same was true in Shenyang, Harbin, and Heilongjiang. However, the number of people arrested is unknown, and the whereabouts of all those arrested are unknown.</p>
<p>Higher Education</p>
<p>(A) Datong College, located in Nanling, Changchun, is a training center for puppet government officials. It is directly under the jurisdiction of the General Affairs Office of the State Council. Its purpose is to train good officials. It recruits certain Japanese graduates, students studying in certain Japanese individuals, and puppet government lower-level officials. After completing their training, they are assigned to various agencies. Certain Japanese are given the best treatment, followed by students studying in certain Japanese individuals, and then non-students studying in certain Japanese individuals. (B) Higher Normal School, located in the old site of Jilin University in Jilin City, with Principal Ma Guanbiao, enrolls certain Japanese students. The annual funding is 307,000 yuan. The Nanling training school is located in Nanling and aims to train primary and secondary school teachers. The director is concurrently held by Xu Ru, the Deputy Minister of the puppet Ministry of Education and Culture. It recruits current primary and secondary school teachers, with an annual funding of 87,336 yuan. In addition, there is a newly established National Higher Agricultural School and the former Sino-Russian co-organized Harbin Institute of Technology, a private medical school. (End)</p>

<p>(Zhenjiang Correspondence) Public and private senior middle schools in Jiangsu Province are currently intensifying training. The graduation of third-year students is approaching, and the proficiency test is imminent. For the convenience of students taking the proficiency test, there are flexible measures. I have recorded it in this newspaper. It is now known that the scope of the test questions, the Proficiency Test Committee decided that algebra and trigonometry would be one group, geometry and analytic geometry would be one group, and physics and chemistry would be divided into upper and lower parts. History and geography are divided into Chinese and foreign groups. At least one question must be selected from each group. This year, it will be postponed. It is also heard that students who refuse to participate in the proficiency test under the pretext of training will not have their student status recognized. However, those who instigate opposition to the proficiency test in school or contact other schools will be investigated by the Department of Education and will be punished according to law and will not be tolerated.</p>

In the afternoon, the first meeting was held, and the articles of association were approved. Chen Xunci, Sun Ming, Pan Ganjian, Sun Yanzhao and other nine people were elected as directors. The association also compiled and printed a volume of the inaugural meeting, which was distributed to members. The board of directors then met on May 1 to discuss many issues, many of which were about the improvement and cooperation of libraries throughout the province. It is said that recently, there are more than 320 public libraries, people's education halls, and school and institutional libraries in Zhejiang Province. The Provincial Library has a collection of 300,000 volumes, and the daily readership, excluding those reading newspapers, is about 750, making it a leader among provincial libraries.</p>

<p>In the recent dozen or so years, the Prime Minister saw that to build and save the country, it was necessary to have military force. The Prime Minister was determined to create a revolutionary army in order to save the country. In the 13th year of the Republic of China, when the Chinese Kuomintang was reorganized, Mr. Chiang was given the responsibility of building the army and saving the country. He founded the Whampoa Military Academy, which continues to be the Central Military Academy today. Let us see its strength. With this small force, it quelled the domestic chaos in a very short period of time and created the great cause of uniting the country with revolution. Think about how much power it had in the beginning. The first class had only four hundred and several dozen people. The Prime Minister said on that day, "Revolutionary soldiers must be able to fight a hundred men with one." At the time, many people thought the Prime Minister was exaggerating, but when we look at the results, we can see that the Prime Minister's words were not an exaggeration. Comparing the power at that time with the power of the warlords, how could it only be one to a hundred? I am afraid it was one to a thousand. We must know that the revolutionary army is different from the general army. Compared with the army of the late Qing Dynasty and the anti-revolutionary army before, the revolutionary army is not only proficient in both literary and martial arts, but also emphasizes both skills and virtues. It not only studies martial arts and cultivates literature, but also has technology and ideology. Therefore, it can defeat those who have no technology and no ideology, or who focus on one aspect of physics. In the past history of China, it is very clear that the separation of civil and military affairs can be seen, and the harm of the incompatibility of skills and virtues can be seen.</p>
<p>Looking again at modern countries, the reason why they can become rich and strong countries, peaceful countries, and culturally advanced countries is that they clearly focus on methodology and consistent civil and military activities. We must seek national unity from this methodology and consistent civil and military activities, and we must concentrate this power to create a strong force for the country and the nation in the world. This is what we must start from education, that is, to realize the Prime Minister's proposition of "creating organized and powerful citizens and an organized and powerful society." If we follow this direction, we can achieve the four major goals of education: "First, to be filial children at home; second, to be useful talents in society; third, to be loyal citizens in the country; and fourth, to be upright people in the world." In military terms, that is, to make all soldiers in the country receive national education, and all citizens in the country receive sound training, especially military training. We must know that national military training not only creates physically strong citizens, but also creates citizens who abide by order, because saving the country and education is not only in the narrow sense of military affairs, but especially emphasizes the social order and sound organization, so as to create a force. Looking at today's economic construction, if we have a sound organization and a sound training, then any undertaking and any major work can be accomplished. For example, taking the Yellow River in the north, since it left the Longmen, it has been unstable. In the past twenty years, there have often been major floods. In recent years, there have been almost no years without floods. Last year alone, there were dozens of counties and millions of people in Shandong and Jiangsu provinces who were fighting the water on both sides of the Yellow River.</p>

<p>Large Investors Observe, Gold Market Fairly Stable, Gold Exchange Rises Slightly by One Cent</p>

However, sellers became active when prices were high, and it soon returned to equilibrium. The HSBC's listed prices were announced, with both British and American rates remaining stable. Although there was a decline afterward, the announcement of an increase of 1.5 cents in the silver balancing tax stimulated buying interest. Transactions gradually became less frequent. The overall trend fluctuated at noon, and the afternoon market was even calmer. The market stabilized and revolved within a narrow range.

<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, the market rebounded slightly from the continuous decline of the past few days. However, transactions were not strong, especially in the morning settlement, where the trading floor was mostly filled with observers. Approximately 200,000 in transactions could influence the market. The market was quite stagnant at the beginning, but became active after No. 72 bought in. The market sentiment was extremely chaotic, capable of going either way. As the trend became slightly firmer, many followed the trend and bought in. However, sellers also emerged, indicating the anxiety of the public. The future trend is still likely to be a large range-bound fluctuation. The opening was quite stable, without any gains or losses, fluctuating between 0.05 and 0.1 yuan. The second session was extremely light, with categories D and J having no opening transactions at all. Category Y recent also saw no interest. Including 96, there were only nine listed prices.

<p>After a Sharp Fall, Yarn and Cotton Surge Again. It is Said that the Long Positions Have Cleared their Obligations and Continue to Take Delivery of This Month's Goods, While Simultaneously Vigorously Buying, Causing the Market to Dry Up and Prices to Rise</p>
<p>The yarn market, which had plummeted the day before, suddenly turned from a slump to a rally, with market prices rising sharply. Each month moved forward in unison. According to market sources, long companies convened a meeting last night, and the general consensus was to continue taking delivery of this month's goods, still dragging in in the near term. Furthermore, one long position had completely cleared the 750,000 that had been dragging, and was making another effort to buy. One firm alone bought 10,000 bales, causing the market to dry up and prices to rise steadily. The cash yarn market feels slightly more lively. It is difficult to predict what the future holds.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Surges by More Than Three Yuan. In the morning opening of the spot yarn market, the near month was unchanged. As it was bid up to the far month, sellers pressed down and fell by 0.3, 0.6 and 0.8 yuan. Unexpectedly, in the second round of bidding, Dafu tried its best to buy in, and Mingde tried its best to buy in in the far month. The trading floor suddenly became tight and the buying trend was very strong. Rumors arose, saying that the long positions convened a discussion, and would continue to take delivery this month. On the one hand, the large investors who had failed to meet the margin call the day before had cleared it in full, and were all vigorously buying in. Although Dachangcheng cut and settled a large number of positions, Mingde, Gengfeng and Dafeng covered their shorts and added to their positions, all coming forward together. As a result, the wind suddenly rose, and the far month jumped up by two yuan. By the third closing, the results were still good. Each shift rose by 1.1, 1.2 and 0.5 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon opening, market conditions were still stable. It was generally said that the Sino-US loan was settled, and the long positions were fighting very hard. Moreover, the spot yarn price used to be 13-14 yuan higher than the three-product yarn. Now, the near month is 1 yuan lower than the three-product yarn, and the far month is still 3-4 yuan higher. As a result, the long positions surged to buy in and add to their positions. How the future unfolds still depends on whether the actual demand improves. As a result, each month rose by 1.4, 6 and 9 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Taichang sold 3,050 bales, Shenji 2,550 bales, Dachangcheng 4,850 bales, Yichang 5,100 bales, Xiecheng 2,700 bales, Renfeng 1,150 bales, Shengyuan 1,450 bales, Tonghe 1,350 bales, Yuanda 1,700 bales, Zhenda 1,450 bales, Jifeng 1,200 bales, Deda 950 bales.

<p>The cotton market suddenly turned firm, and the rising wind was very strong, because the long positions were still unwilling to give up. Some strong people were still dragging in and adding to their positions. The market said that the Sino-US loan was successful. This month still belongs to receiving goods. At the same time, the yarn market is powerful, and the cash cotton sales are more active, which is really caused by the continuous sharp falls, and there should be this kind of reaction.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Buying is Very Strong. In the morning opening of the spot cotton market, the near month fell by 0.15 to 0.2 yuan. Bidding to the immediate month, it was found that it was tight and rising, rising by 0.1 and 0.2 yuan. As the strength of the long side was still insufficient, the margin call was paid in full, and it still came to drag in and add to the code, which was a huge amount. In the second round of bidding, the yarn market was jumping by two yuan, and the trading floor suddenly became harmonious, and the buying was very strong. Hexing, Guangfeng, Jinghua and Mingde added to their positions and made up their shorts, but Dachangcheng, Tongfei and Changhe cut and settled and opened their shorts together, but all the chips were completely searched by them. As a result, each month rose by 0.3 and 0.4 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day. In the afternoon opening, there was a lack of sellers in the market, and the trend was rising. Mingde bought a lot, but Dachangcheng continued to cut and settle vigorously. The closing month was slightly tired. The results of each month are 0.25 to 0.4 yuan higher than the closing price in the morning.

<p>Futures Flour Soars and Plummets. It is Said that There are Still Waves Ahead</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning, the market in each month showed erratic, skyrocketing and plummeting phenomena. The quotation for foreign wheat was Chicago fell 4 points to 1.2 yuan, Canada has no market, and the opening price in June was 3.06 yuan. Unexpectedly, the weather has been sunny, and the old and new wheat in various places have been reported to be abundant, so people are empty, and the pressure on selling is very strong. In the midst of repeated and violent falls, the June issue fell to 2.99 yuan in the third shift, which was a difference of up to 0.7 yuan from the opening price. However, after the downwind passed, the extra-market bulls made every effort to raise it, so the closing price was raised to 3.0225 yuan. Although other months tended to fall, the rise and fall was not drastic. By the time of the afternoon opening, transactions were still smooth, and the market gradually returned to normal. As for the strange breathing in June, it is really the handover of new and old, and the observations of long and short are different, so the rise is easy, and the fall is also as fast as lightning. According to the speculation of people in the industry, the changes in the future will be huge. Compared to the whole day, all fell by about 0.3-0.4 yuan. Another flour opening price, the standard opening price was 2.35 yuan, and the transaction was not much.</p>

<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market, after opening in the morning, all months fell. Because the weather has been clear, the sales of the industry have naturally become smoother. The old wheat in various places that is rumored in the market is easy to shake people's hearts. Therefore, the price saw a big fatigue, and each month fell again and again, falling 0.6, 0.7 and 0.8 yuan less than the previous day. By the time of the afternoon opening, the market in each month was still tired, and transactions also increased step by step. According to the current situation, if the weather is clear and the wheat seedlings are transparent, the impulse of people will be inevitable. In the current wheat market, various factories have stopped due to poor flour sales, and the entry stomach has been silent. Yesterday, the shouting price was 0.9 yuan, and yesterday I heard that the opening price was 0.85 yuan. There were still no formal transactions, because the new arrival was not seen, and the deposit loan only opened 800 packages, which was handled by Fuxin. According to the industry's speculation, it may be necessary to abandon the price to between 0.6-0.7 yuan.</p>
<p>The US wheat market, a large batch of wheat from the southwest was transported to Chicago, and buyers will inevitably hedge futures, and the May period will see relaxation. This matter may affect the market soon. The government's winter wheat production is estimated to be 463,708,000 bushels, which is lower than expected. Supply estimates were reduced by 2,840,000 bushels last week.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the French and American exchange rates both contracted, and the silk prices in Yokohama and New York suddenly fell again. (Yokohama spot 723 yuan, futures 699 yuan, both fell by about 15 yuan compared to the previous day.) As a result, the silk electricity issued by Shenbu to the outside world the day before did not return any news. The silk sales of foreign firms have just subsided, but because the silkworm news has not been good, the cocoon cost has been consistently high, and the silk market has been firm.</p>

There is no bottom line in the current market, but there will be samples coming out one after another in the next few days. I heard that Luzhuang's Suian Zhenmei can arrive in Shanghai on the 14th and 15th. The market wants to have a new atmosphere.

Now, this matter is due to various parties holding different opinions, and the tea house also has different opinions. After listening to the opinions of all parties, Cheng Zhenji, general manager of the distribution office, has decided to organize a unified agency for export.

The transaction of the No. 120 Tianqiao brand for private goods was very miserable, and the price was 308 yuan. The No. 100 matte silk has healthy sales and the price has not risen or fallen. Local Japanese and European foreign firms have not achieved any transactions this month, because there are enough private goods and customs auctioned goods on the market, and the price should be lower than the official tax-paid goods.</p>

<p>The First Batch of Nipple Squid Catches Were Not Good, The Goods Stored on the Street Were Waiting to Be Sold, and Each Stall's Selling Price Rose by 2-3 Yuan</p>
<p>Nipple squid According to the news from fishing households in various mountains in Ningbo, this year's Geng Yin is due to the cold weather, and the first batch of catches was not good. Each ship has less than 1,000 catties at most, so the market price of fresh cuttlefish in this city has been 10 yuan or more. If it were in previous years, it would not be surprising to sell for 7-8 yuan, so those who have old goods stored on the street are now tightened up and sold slowly, waiting for a good price to sell. The market is therefore quite firm. Yesterday, the selling price of the industry was 32 yuan for the Ningbo Ti, 28 yuan for the Tizhuang goods, 25 yuan for the Gaotongzhuang goods, 23-24 yuan for the ordinary Zhuang, and 22 yuan for the Xiatong goods. Compared to the previous market, each stall rose by 2-3 yuan, and many were reluctant to sell, but the sales to various customers are now hesitant. It is said that the rising wind may be even more in the future. According to people in the industry, the market in the future depends on the results of the second and third batch of catches to determine success or failure.</p>

<p>Yesterday's sugar market trend was flat. I heard that Director Feng once came to the new public association to declare that the general idea was that tax reduction was inevitable, but the smuggling problem should be dealt with jointly by officials and businessmen to be effective. Therefore, people are slightly calm, but the current sales are not smooth, and the sugar price seems difficult to get better. The public association's drawing disk 24 crude white spot goods and transit goods are called the original price, and the Dong Chi Bai is not much changed. Only the No. 8 Dong Bai TY mark spot goods were traded at 21.35 yuan, and the transit goods were called 6.45 yuan, which was 0.025 yuan higher. The original price of Mianbai Zhenji Dahua Jinxin from this factory did not move, and the No. 8 goods were still silent, and there was no follow-up opening, but it was heard that the Yuhua gang had secretly opened 500 packages of Dagong white, and the price was 0.1-0.2 yuan lower than before.</p>

<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market, because the factory's minds were set, the yarn flower market gradually returned to peace, and the market was still stable. In the past few days, the Yangtze River area has been overcast and rainy, and the stores in various places have been deserted, and the shipment of goods has been greatly reduced. Yesterday, due to the sunny weather, the shipment of goods was quite complicated. Hunan Province, Changsha, Hengzhou, and Changde shipped more goods, and this factory's Guangzhongmei Hengli New and other factories' bleached cloth, foreign yarn, striped plain silk, and plain linen yarn and Linchang factory's printed cloth and Santai factory's small fine cloth, etc., were more than 100 pieces. Hubei's Tianyu did not move due to the rain. The Guangdong gang had previously purchased 5-600 pieces of fine twill and fine cloth from this factory, and there was no follow-up consideration recently. The previously set goods were shipped in batches. The Guangdong market was also very bad. The Linchang product's new flower linen yarn, this port's big company and the wholesale sales of Jiangxi and Zhejiang inland are quite good. It is currently sold for 8.7 yuan per piece.</p>

<p>— (Yun Su)</p>
<p>If you are trapped in a heavily guarded prison, you should not be disheartened and weep; nor should you hope that others will come to your aid and rescue you. You should rely on your own strength, fight against the demons of adversity, protest, and declare war, completely shattering and casting off the chains that bind you, restoring your former freedom, and obtaining happiness in life. Otherwise, your suffering will never end.</p>
<p>Whatever one's life may be, it is always better to have some waves and ripples. Regardless of whether they are joyful, painful; happy, tragic; victorious, or unsuccessful, they are much better than being mediocre, silent, obscure, and uneventful. It's like drinking ruby red wine and bitter black water, which are definitely better than drinking plain boiled water.</p>
<p>Love can bring people infinite happiness, but it can also give people infinite wounds. However, the taste of love is definitely not something everyone can experience, nor something everyone can comprehend. Because even if you are close to it and admire it, it may reject you from afar and not develop any passion with you, then you can do nothing about it. I think young friends would be better off dedicating their naked hearts entirely to literature and art. Because as long as you fall in love with it, it will never reject you or tease you, and it can at least give you some comfort and some sweetness.</p>
<h3 id="e188">A Cross-Section of a City Corner <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>Between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, the neon lights outside the big stores, red and blue, reflect each other. Under this intense neon light, everything at a crossroads is projected, a cross-section of a city corner.</p>
<p>The red police light turned green, and the cars crowded at the north-south intersection bravely rushed forward. There were big-bottomed ones, snub-nosed ones, old-fashioned three-dimensional ones, and new-fashioned streamlined ones. Carrying, of course, were gentlemen and noble ladies. But behind these cars, there were rickshaw pullers who overestimated their abilities, desperately chasing forward, as if wanting to compete with the cars for speed. -- No, they were running for their livelihood. On their arms, there were always quasi-gentlemen sitting askew in the carriages, pretending to be leisurely, running like cattle and horses.</p>
<p>The trams on the north-south road were also slowly crawling forward. Pedestrians were also rushing forward at this moment, crossing the road. Old Shanghainese always strolled leisurely, so calmly. At this time, under the red police light at the east-west intersection, snake-headed trams stopped again, spitting out a large group of male, female, old, and young passengers, and at the same time swallowing another large group. The platform was followed by a burst of commotion. The children selling evening newspapers were shouting with hoarse voices. Beggars, with forced smiles, were chasing pedestrians. Prostitutes with red rouge and white powder on their faces, wrapped in red and green cheongsams, were constantly sweeping pedestrians with flirtatious eyes. Hooligans were teasing wantonly. Little rascals were staring at the velvet hats of certain passengers in the cars, planning to "snatch the top hat." Everything was extremely active.</p>
<p>The patrolman at the intersection blew his whistle, the color of the police light changed, and trams, cars, rickshaws, and pedestrians were again interweaving on the east-west road. Commotion was being staged again at the north-south intersection. Cars -- people -- cars --, constantly coming and going on the east-west road, the north-south road, always so crowded, pushing, but the shop assistants in the big stores along the street were just idly watching with their sleeves folded, although the neon lights, red and blue, were constantly shining outside the window.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Thoughts on Yu Jianhua's Art Exhibition <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Binhong</p>
<p>Among my friends, there are two Yu Jianhuas. One is Yu Jianhua from Taicang, and the other is Yu Jianhua from Jinan. Yu Jianhua from Taicang is a member of the Nanshe Society, and Yu Jianhua from Jinan is a member of the Lanman Society. One is skilled in poetry, ancient prose, and lyrics, and the other is skilled in calligraphy and painting. I once visited Yu Jianhua from Taicang with Yu Jianhua from Jinan on the Double Ninth Festival in the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, and the two Yus then became friends through writing. Now Yu Jianhua from Taicang is ill and disabled at home, while Yu Jianhua from Jinan is showing off his artistic talents on the art scene in Shanghai. Every time he holds an art exhibition, his works are always highly sought after. His learning comes from the school of Chen Shizeng of Yining. Previously, Shizeng lived in Shanghai and established the Wenmei Society with Master Hongyi (namely Li Shutong) of Qingdao, inviting me to join. He gave me a branch of ink plum blossom he wrote himself, Shutong produced seal carvings, Qingdaoren made clerical script, and we talked day and night, which was very enjoyable for a while. Later, we dispersed, Shizeng and Qingdaoren passed away one after another, Shutong converted to Buddhism, and I am also getting old. It seems like looking back at old events. Mr. Yu came to the south, became more skilled, and wrote more works. In recent years, he sailed on the Ou River, climbed Hua Peak, and searched all the wonders of the mountains and rivers of eastern Zhejiang and Jiangxi, presenting them one by one in his brush and ink. He will gather his usual masterpieces and exhibit them for the public to enjoy. I was able to see them and sighed that the achievement of ancient literati in art must be based on reading ten thousand books and traveling ten thousand miles, and then they can broaden their minds, express their emotions, and not share the same likes and dislikes as the customs of the time. Mr. Yu is still young and diligent in his studies. Even now, the works on display, modeling mountains and imitating water, are all exquisite. What he has seen is enough to make those who are old in the literary and art world step back. If Shizeng and other gentlemen were still alive, I don't know how they would praise him happily. Looking back and forth between the past and the present, and observing this gathering, I secretly feel happy for myself. I write this casually in the idle window. May of the Bingzi year of the Republic of China, Huang Binhong, at the age of seventy-three.</p>
<h3 id="e190">From Milk Chicken to People Tired of the City <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>There is a family in Tiansizhuang, Suzhou, who raises a cow and a bull, and also has a small disinfection device. Not only can the whole family, men, women, old and young, have fresh milk in the morning and evening all year round, but also relatives and friends let the calves born by the cow be female, and after they grow up, they add a source of milk, and the male ones are slaughtered. The meat of the calves is unusually tender. If the excess milk is used to feed the chickens, when they grow up, they become milk chickens, which are fresh, tender and delicious, incomparable to any meat food. For example, the West Lake Condensed Milk Company in Hangzhou produces light milk in addition to milk powder, condensed milk, butter, and buttermilk, which requires a large amount of milk, so it also buys fresh milk from the people, and the rearing business not only enables it to produce continuously, but also makes people feel happy.</p>
<p>Taking fish farming as an example, its breeding power is very rapid, and raising one hundred fish can feed a family. Why don't people who are tired of the city think about raising animals?</p>

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 1 Sipping Tea and Chatting in a Clear Night Window Listening to Rain, Plucking Branches and Admiring the Beauty Shadow Flower Lane Spreads Fragrance</p>
<p>Guoqi's heart was pounding with Bo Bo's. He was thinking, could it be that people knew that he was peeking at them? For a young man to peek at a girl like this, it was inevitable that he would appear frivolous. With a movement in his heart, the blush on his face went straight behind his ears. So he lowered his head and was about to walk away. Just at this moment, he heard the girl gently say, Little brother, pluck a small branch for me. But each of you can only pluck a small branch, don't pluck too much, after all, flowers look better growing on the tree. Guoqi was originally going to leave, but after hearing this, he didn't know why, his footsteps stopped. Therefore, he stopped and didn't leave, and he couldn't help but raise his head. This time, he met her face to face. He just saw her eyes turn, and he lowered his head. He casually smelled the small branch of apricot blossom in his hand, then looked up at the apricot blossoms on the wall again, and then went around the stool the children were using to pick flowers. Because the alley was very narrow, he went around the stool and crossed the dividing line in the middle of the alley. His body and Guoqi's were less than two feet apart. Guoqi felt too close, so he didn't dare to look at her, so he lowered his head again. By the time he raised his head, she had already walked past, but although she had walked past, there was a burst of intoxicating fragrance surrounding his body. When he looked at her, she had already walked away calmly. Although Guoqi was thin-skinned, he didn't feel embarrassed to look at her back, so he stood in the center of the alley and looked in that direction. He thought to himself, she must be walking away like this, and she won't come back. Just as he was watching in a daze, she suddenly stopped and looked back. She probably didn't expect Guoqi to be standing behind her, still looking at her back, so after she turned her head back, she immediately turned around. Guoqi also felt that his attitude was wrong, and his face turned red. But before this embarrassment had completely disappeared, the girl turned her head again. In his imagination, she might have thought that Guoqi wouldn't be standing there for long, so she came back to take a look. Seeing that he was still there the second time, she couldn't look back again, and quickly took two steps and turned around the corner of the alley. This time, Guoqi was stunned, standing in the same place, unable to move. Suddenly, the nine children clapped and laughed, and he was warned in his heart that they must be mocking him here. So he put on a generous appearance and walked forward. He couldn't help but speculate in his heart that this girl was only sixteen or seventeen years old, and seeing her carrying a schoolbag, there was no doubt that she was a female student. Not far from here, there is a girls' middle school, so she must be a female student from this girls' school. Of course, seeing how smart she looked, her homework must be very good. But why didn't she walk with her classmates, but walked alone? That's right, her home must not be far from here, so she walked very calmly. Thinking and walking, he turned into a small alley, and then he raised his head and saw where he was. Ah! This is the alley not far from home, why did he walk back on the road to home? (21)</p>

<h3 id="e192">Parks in Japan <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Yun</p>
<p>The most ideal comfort in the monotonous lives of urban people is the park. Our people mostly enjoy themselves alone in private gardens. Therefore, parks in various countries are more common than in our country. There are already more than a dozen parks near Tokyo, Japan, and even more children's parks. Last year, five or six members of a certain elementary school's baseball team were crushed to death by a tram, which was severely criticized by public opinion. Therefore, this year, 157 small parks will be built for children to play and rest. Japanese children throw their schoolbags at home after school and go to the streets and small parks. Five or six-year-old children are often accompanied by their parents, older siblings, and play in the sandpit. There are only trees in the small park, and very few flowers. In the middle are iron exercise equipment, so it is called a children's park.</p>
<p>The temples and shrines in Japan used to have large areas. They were planted with trees and cherry blossoms and arranged as gardens. The larger ones had five-story pagodas, stone lanterns, stone archways and other buildings. Originally, they were used for worship and recreation, but after being transformed and expanded, they became parks. Therefore, foreigners who come to Japan for the first time are always suspicious when they see temples in Japanese parks.</p>
<p>Tokyo's Shiba Park was transformed from Zojoji Temple. The layout is similar to that of our country's gardens. It also uses flying springs and hanging waterfalls to create pools, and stacked stones to create hills, giving it the vitality of mountains and forests. It is an old-fashioned Japanese garden layout method. This kind of park is quiet and winding, but it is not valued by many people, so there are very few visitors. The new parks in our country are also inclined to Westernization, with more lawns, flower beds, and Western-style buildings. The Japanese are the same, such as Hibiya and Ueno Parks, which have all broken away from Japan's inherent Chinese-style gardening method. In fact, our country's gardening method has a unique pleasure.</p>
<p>Japanese parks often have fishing ponds, boating, sports fields, lecture halls, libraries, etc. This can generate some income for expansion and maintenance. In addition to walking, visitors can also get other sports or entertainment. Ueno Park also has science museums, museums, zoos, etc. Using parks to impart knowledge to the public is an excellent method. Each park has various exhibitions every month, such as gardening, bonsai, toys, small animals, etc., which can attract audiences and arouse enthusiasts. In our country's parks, there are tea houses where two or three friends can taste tea and chat, which can also bring a day of peace. In Japanese parks, business is generally not allowed, but there are many street vendors nearby. Therefore, tourists who come to the park bring water bottles and lunch boxes for outdoor picnics. As a result, the park is full of paper scraps and fruit peels, which require several trucks to transport every day.</p>
<p>Utilizing nature is a special feature of Japanese park construction. All lakesides, valleys, and suburban forests are developed into parks. They are connected by very cheap elevated trains. Every spring and autumn, not only does the business of trains greatly increase, but also the people near the park make a lot of profit by selling local products. If our country can slightly organize the scenic spots in various places and connect them with convenient transportation for sightseeing, I think urban people can have more opportunities to contact the countryside and be vigilant. And rural local products can also be revitalized as a result.</p>
<p>Anecdotes</p>
<h3 id="e193">A Page from Li Zhongtang's Diary of Envoy <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Fan Xianwei</p>
<p>Li Fuxiang's mission was in March of the twenty-third year of Guangxu. It was originally a special trip to congratulate the Russian Emperor on his coronation. Because Russia had previously hinted to the Qing court that if a minister was sent to congratulate the coronation ceremony, a prince should be specially sent. If not, then Zhongtang would be fine! Therefore, the Qing court specially ordered Zhongtang to go on a mission, and also to tour the major countries of Europe. Zhongtang led his son Jingfang and dozens of attendants and left the country on a certain day in March.</p>
<p>He arrived at Awesisha on April 27 and reached the Russian capital on the 30th.</p>
<p>He was received by the Russian Emperor on May 4. The ceremony was very solemn. On the 18th, he arrived at the Moscow government, where the coronation ceremony was held. After the ceremony, he went to Germany.</p>
<p>He arrived in the German capital on June 13. He visited the German Emperor the next day. He received very good treatment. On the 15th, he visited the retired Prime Minister Bismarck.</p>
<p>He arrived in Paris, the French capital, on July 13. The French government's treatment was no less than that of other countries. After staying for more than ten days, he took a boat from Haarlem to England.</p>
<p>He arrived in England on August 2. England gave Zhongtang a carriage and allowed him to stay at the Duke of Lancashire's residence. The next day, he met the British Emperor at Ashmore Castle and accompanied him to watch the British generals' naval fleet exercises. On the 7th, he was invited to a banquet by the China Association. On the 8th, the British Prime Minister Salisbury asked his wife to host a banquet for Zhongtang at the Prime Minister's residence. On the 10th, he attended a banquet hosted by the Shanghai Hong Kong Bank. Since then, he toured for several days, visiting the Bank of England, the submarine cable engineering bureau, and the shipyard. On the eve of his departure, he went to see the Grand Theater. Arriving in the United States, the United States also treated him with great courtesy. In short, Zhongtang's tour of various countries was regarded as a distinguished guest.</p>
<p>After Zhongtang returned, he first stayed in Tianjin for eleven days, and then went to the capital to report. Suddenly, he was impeached and fined for entering the forbidden garden without permission. Later, he donated ninety taels of silver to redeem his sins.</p>

<p>— Liaoyang</p>
<p>In the year of Ji Chou in Guangxu, I, Yu Zhonglu, Ying Shushen, and Feng Junmu made joint poems at the Shigu Pavilion in Cihu. Han Jun Puquan made this painting for us. Suddenly, fifty years have passed. Shushen and Junmu have already been buried. Zhonglu and I are also getting old. The painting has been transferred to Yu Jun Jitiao. Recently, Jitiao took out the scroll and asked for a poem. Looking back on the past tour, it seems like another world. I wrote four chapters, not knowing where the tears come from.</p>
<p>Opening the scroll, tears flow. Searching for the traces of Ying and Feng here. The green mountains are unharmed, but the poets are old. Only the lake reflects the white hair.</p>
<p>The turquoise mist and light are carefully drawn. The spring rain is Xiao Xiao. The water beside the Fenshi Guan Xiang Shrine. Green to the bridge of the city in the south.</p>
<p>The old garden is dilapidated and there is no home. I feel the years passing by in the poetry arena. Leaving the sentence of Hengbo shining on my eyes. I still dare not face the plum blossoms.</p>
<p>The elegant skirts are fluttering. The rhymes are left to remember the youth. There is still the affectionate Yu Jizi. Willing to protect the flower paper with the remaining ink.</p>
<p>Two days before the Shangsi Festival, Du Liang invited Zhu Bieyou, Chen Liaoshi, Hong Shu'a, Qian Taixi, Wang Zhongxian and other children to a wine gathering. Drinking Bi Chang Liaoshi had a poem that turned out to be even. Liaoyang</p>
<p>The scenery of my hometown is infinite. The sound of orioles enters the orchestra through the trees. The new willows contain smoke and are charming. The remaining plum blossoms dot the water and are beautiful. The windows peep at the thousands of verdant eyebrows. The seats are lined with sages, young and old. It is not easy to enjoy pleasure. How many years will we face each other in a cup?</p>

<h3 id="e196">The Harm of Masturbation <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Xiaohan</p>
<p>The bad habit of masturbation has become an open secret among young people. Not only men commit it, but women are also infected.</p>
<p>Masturbation depletes oneself. It is a daily attack. The vas deferens becomes relaxed and is most likely to cause symptoms such as spermatorrhea and nocturnal emission. Not only is essence frequently consumed, but the brain is also damaged, and vitality is destroyed, and diseases arise.</p>
<p>Essence is the most precious treasure of the human body. It is directly related to offspring and can indirectly nourish the brain and the whole body. Therefore, those who masturbate or suffer from nocturnal emission, their essence is dry and thin, their brain is also weak, and their muscles are thin, their spirits are weak, their health is lost, and various diseases occur.</p>
<p>The treatment method is to abstain from masturbation. Pay attention to health. Take "Himi Tuo's Jing Solidifying Pills" internally to treat nocturnal emission. Once the sperm gate is solid, it can be throttled. Also take "Reproduction Hormone" to replenish the loss. Vitality is restored and a source of income can be opened. This spring, I cured the symptoms of spermatorrhea and nocturnal emission of students Feng Hanzhang, worker Jin Shaokang, and employee Yang Dirong, and they all achieved the most satisfactory special effects.</p>
<h3 id="e197">The Principle of Backache and Bone Pain <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Bofu</p>
<p>Treatment emphasizes both cultivation and detoxification</p>
<p>The kidneys are responsible for clearing blood and detoxifying. Those with kidney deficiency not only have weak bodies and lose vitality, but also the "uric acid" in the blood cannot be adequately eliminated, and it will form "uric acid crystals." Its shape is like broken glass and it is harmful in various parts of the body, causing back pain, bone pain, and muscle aches. Over time, the arteries harden and are prone to stroke.</p>
<p>"Strong Siden's Bone Pain Pills" function to dissolve uric acid, eliminate residual toxins, dispel wind and dampness, and prevent hardening of the arteries and stroke. Therefore, it is the supreme remedy for the treatment of back pain, bone pain, and muscle aches. It is effective for those who suffer from numbness in the hands and feet, hemiplegia, and total paralysis.</p>
<p>However, if back pain is caused by physical weakness, it is advisable to take "Reproduction Hormone". At the beginning of winter, I used "Female Reproduction Hormone" and "Strong Siden's Bone Pain Pills" to cure Mrs. Zhang Xianting's back pain, which is clear evidence.</p>

<p>— Wang Shiying</p>
<p>Last winter, Mr. Cao Zhiliang was cured by me with "Strong Siden's Bone Pain Pills" for his previous rheumatism and bone pain, and numbness in his limbs. Therefore, he introduced his colleague Mr. Shao to consult. He complained of premature aging, cold limbs, body tremors, back pain, dizziness, fatigue, palpitations, night sweats and other symptoms. I immediately prescribed the medicine according to the symptoms and instructed him to purchase "Reproduction Hormone" from the Zhengwei Pharmacy. Because "Reproduction Hormone" not only has the effect of greatly replenishing qi and blood, but also has the effect of reversing aging, so after taking it for less than a month, he reported that he had rejuvenated, all the symptoms were eliminated, and he happily thanked me and left.</p>

<p>(Mr. Hu Xingwu wrote a letter saying) My wife's body is inherently weak. Since she came to me, her menstruation has never been accurate. Five or six years ago, she suffered from leucorrhea. Her abdomen hurt during menstruation, and her body was even weaker. In recent years, she has often suffered from insomnia, back pain, premature ejaculation, and there is no hope of having children. She has been married for sixteen years and has no children. (Excerpt) Last summer, I was introduced by a close relative to Dr. Zhan Nianceng for treatment. Following the instructions, I purchased "Female Reproduction Hormone" for internal use and "Leukorrhea Eliminator" for external use from Taihe Pharmacy. I used both internally and externally according to the law for about five weeks. The vaginal discharge was cleared, menstruation was regulated, her body was strong, and premature ejaculation was also cured. Vitality was reborn. Now that my wife is pregnant and about to give birth, although I don't know if it will be a boy or a girl, the power of famous doctors and famous medicines is still in my heart. I write this to express my gratitude and to introduce it to those who have the same disease.</p>

<p>— Qiao Wenbin</p>
<p>This disease is mostly caused by masturbation, which leads to relaxation of the sperm gate. Therefore, "Himi Tuo's Sperm Solidifying Pills" are mainly used. Take two to four pills with boiled water before going to bed. Patients consume essence and qi, have weak brains and dream a lot, and also complain of insomnia and forgetfulness. Therefore, they should also take "Reproduction Hormone" at the same time. Three pills each time, three times a day, with boiled water.</p>
<p>Patient Wu Zhonglin came to consult in early spring and complained of symptoms such as spermatorrhea and nocturnal emission, insomnia and forgetfulness, dizziness, and unbearable distress. I instructed him to purchase the above-mentioned two medicines from Wuzhou Pharmacy. After taking the medicine, his brain was healthy and his essence was sufficient, and the disease was cured by itself. After taking it continuously for a month, his body was strong and healthy, and he was completely different from before.</p>

<p>(Mr. Zhu Shaoqing wrote a letter saying) I previously suffered from venereal disease. Although it was cured, it turned into joint pain, blood deficiency and facial aging. I have taken many kinds of Chinese and Western medicines, but they have not been effective. I have back pain, muscle spasms, a thin and weak body, and difficulty walking. Last winter, I was introduced by my colleague Mr. Song You San to Dr. Zhan Nianceng for treatment. I was instructed to purchase "Strong Siden's Bone Pain Pills" from Zhongxi Pharmacy to eliminate toxins and dispel wind. The bone pain was immediately relieved. I also took "Reproduction Hormone" to restore the decline. Qi and blood immediately became strong. The muscles suddenly became strong. After taking about half a dozen, I have now returned to the youthful state of many years ago. However, the state of being strong and healthy is unprecedented since I was born.</p>

<p>— Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>Women's diseases are mostly caused by uterine diseases. Uterine diseases are generally caused by the decline of the gonads. Therefore, if "Female Gonad Hormone" is used, women's diseases will be cured immediately.</p>
<p>... "Female Reproduction Hormone" ...</p>
<p>Women smoke because they suffer from various diseases that cannot be cured, and they are mentally exhausted, which leads to smoking addiction. "Female Reproduction Hormone" is not only the authority of female gonad preparations, but also has effective ingredients for detoxification and addiction withdrawal. Therefore, it is used to treat various gynecological diseases and to quit opium, and it can achieve the most perfect special effects. I have recently used "Female Reproduction Hormone" to quit the smoking addiction of Mrs. Li Rongqing and others, which proves that it is the supreme remedy for treating diseases and quitting smoking.</p>

<p>(A letter from Mr. Shi Xinyuan states) I have a weak constitution. In my childhood, I did not have good development. My body was thin and my blood was deficient. From the spring of my nineteenth year, I suddenly suffered from nocturnal emissions, which led to seminal depletion and lower back pain, dizziness and blurred vision. During the day, I was forgetful; at night, I suffered from insomnia. My nerves were weak, my thoughts were pessimistic, I was like a fool or a madman, and I often had thoughts of ending my life. I took various tonics, but they had no effect. Last winter, I sent a letter to the question-and-answer column of this publication. I was advised to take "Schmidt's Semen Strengthening Pills" and "Germinal Essence" internally. I immediately purchased them from the nearby Taihe Pharmacy and took them according to instructions. After taking them, my sperm was sufficient and my brain was healthy. All my ailments were eliminated. My nerves were revitalized, my blood was abundant, and my thoughts were positive. I often felt optimistic. Recalling the inhuman suffering of the past, it was as if I had been saved and reborn.</p>

<p>(A letter from Mr. Zhou Weiting states) I have suffered from bone pain for a long time. I have taken various remedies, but they have not been effective. Whenever there is cloudy and rainy weather, I feel even more pain and weakness all over my body. (Omission) Fortunately, I was introduced by a close relative to Dr. Zhan Nianzeng. According to the diagnosis, the cause was that I had previously suffered from gonorrhea and had mistakenly taken inferior medicine, which caused the poison to enter the bones. I received electrotherapy and was also instructed to purchase and take "Strong-Den's Bone Pain Pills" from the Sino-French Pharmacy. After a month of diagnosis and treatment, I was completely cured. Dr. Zhan's skillful hands and compassionate heart have greatly benefited the people.</p>

<p>— Physician Zhan Nianzeng</p>
<p>(Clinic) Second floor of the China Trust Company building on the corner of Sichuan Road and Beijing Road</p>
<p>(1) Safe Smoking Cessation for Women's Hidden Diseases</p>
<p>Patient: Mrs. Lai Xilin. (Chief complaint) — Menstrual pain, leucorrhea. (Medical history) — Mrs. Song has a weak constitution and is prone to worry and illness. She has failed to take care of herself, resulting in further deficiencies. Before marriage, she often helped her mother with work and was often tired, suffering from uterine cold and menstrual pain. She also accompanied her mother in smoking, which led to addiction. She repeatedly tried to quit but failed. After marriage, she suffered from leucorrhea, which she secretly concealed. The feelings between husband and wife gradually faded. Until last winter, her mother's smoking addiction and stomach problems were safely treated by me with "Female Germinal Essence" and "Stomach Pain Relief". She initially came to me for help in quitting smoking. (Treatment) — I observed that Mrs. Song had severe uterine inflammation. I immediately instructed her to purchase "Female Germinal Essence" from the Western Medicine Department of Wing On Company to warm the uterus, regulate menstruation, reduce inflammation, and relieve pain. I also gave her "Leucorrhea Relief" to use externally at home. Because "Female Germinal Essence" can also replenish the body, eliminate toxins, and break addiction, within a month, she regained her health and beauty. The feelings between husband and wife were better than when they were newly married.</p>
<p>(2) Treatment of Nocturnal Emission, Premature Ejaculation, and Kidney Weakness</p>
<p>Patient: Liu Xiaolun. Age 31. From Yangzhou. Works in industry. (Chief complaint) — Nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, kidney weakness. (Medical history) — Mr. Liu was induced by bad friends in his early years and engaged in severe masturbation. His reproductive glands suffered significant damage, and he suffered from severe nocturnal emissions. The condition worsened over time. After marriage, he felt that he had severe premature ejaculation and kidney weakness, making it difficult to fulfill his husbandly duties and dashing his hopes for offspring. It was not until early spring that he came to me for diagnosis. (Treatment) — In addition to performing the latest scientific surgical electrical therapy, I also believed that the source of Mr. Liu's illness was in the reproductive glands. Only "Germinal Essence" could provide targeted treatment. I immediately instructed him to purchase "Germinal Essence" and "Schmidt's Semen Strengthening Pills" from the Sino-Western Pharmacy and take them together according to instructions. After taking them, his sperm gate was immediately strengthened, and his reproductive glands also regained vitality. After about four weeks, all his ailments were eliminated. His vitality was restored, and he regained his health. It was like being reborn.</p>
<p>(Note) Dr. Zhan's clinic is open from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Closed on Sundays.</p>

<p>Kidney Deficiency, Lower Back Pain, Nervous Weakness</p>
<p>Patient: Ding Qichao. Age 37. From Jianglin. Businessman. (Chief complaint) — Lower back pain, nervous weakness. (Medical history) — Mr. Ding had congenital deficiencies and was thin and weak. He had suffered from the above symptoms for no less than twelve years. Repeated treatments were ineffective, and his suffering increased frequently. In recent years, the symptoms of nervous weakness have become more severe. Dizziness, blurred vision, and bone pain in the brain have caused him unspeakable suffering. In early spring, he was introduced by a close relative and came to me for treatment. (Present symptoms) — Bone pain in the brain, rheumatic pain. (Treatment) — After examination, I found that Mr. Ding also suffered from rheumatism. Therefore, his head, brain, back, and spine were all sore and painful. In addition to performing electrotherapy, I immediately instructed him to purchase "Strong-Den's Bone Pain Pills" from Huamei Pharmacy to remove the rheumatism and treat the bone pain. "Germinal Essence" was used to treat his weakness and strengthen his lower back. After taking five or six boxes in a row, he immediately felt his lower back lighter and healthier, and his bones were comfortable. All his ailments were eliminated.</p>
<p>Youthful Common Disease, Re-entering the Bedroom</p>
<p>Patient: Pang Bingyao. Age 19. From Wujiang. Student. (Chief complaint) — Nocturnal emission, wet dreams, insomnia, forgetfulness. (Medical history) — Mr. Li was poisoned by obscene books and mistakenly developed the bad habit of self-indulgence. He harmed himself in secret and depleted his vitality. His sperm was depleted and his brain was weakened. His thinking ability sharply declined, affecting his studies. He finally forced himself to quit, but it had already caused nocturnal emission and wet dreams. The frequency increased, and he also suffered from insomnia and forgetfulness. His spirit was declining, and he was in great distress. His muscles were thin, and his complexion was sallow. It was not until the end of winter that he asked his classmate Mr. Zhang to introduce him to me for treatment. (Present symptoms) — Sperm depletion, muscle loss, blood deficiency, body weakness. (Treatment) — I instructed him to purchase "Schmidt's Semen Strengthening Pills" from the Sino-British Pharmacy to treat his nocturnal emission and wet dreams, and to replenish his sperm and blood, strengthen his muscles, and improve his body. I also instructed him to take "Germinal Essence" for targeted treatment. After four or five periods, all symptoms were eliminated. It was like being reborn.</p>

<h3 id="e207">The Hunger Brigade of the Unemployed <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>Recently, a new type of group has been frequently appearing in the world, namely the "Hunger Brigade" organized by the unemployed. Some time ago, a group of workers in Britain, seeing that the authorities were using large sums of money taken from the people to manufacture weapons of mass destruction, while asking a large group of people with no means of livelihood to endure hunger, organized a hunger brigade and petitioned the government, saying: "We demand bread, not warships." Recently, 270,000 unemployed people in New Jersey, USA, also organized a similar group and went to Trenton, with more than a thousand people occupying the inside and outside of the legislature, claiming that they would not withdraw until the legislature had planned relief funds.</p>
<p>Currently, all countries in the world are in a state of economic panic. The increasing number of unemployed people in society has become a serious problem. But are the countries really so poor that they cannot even afford to feed their people? I'm afraid that's not the case. Not to mention anything else, large military expenditures can be paid, so why can't the people's food and clothing be maintained? The demands of the British workers are correct. "We demand bread, not warships." Only bread can solve the hunger of the unemployed, and warships will only increase their suffering. The American workers' application for the authorities to plan relief funds is also a legitimate request.</p>
<p>What is the situation in our country? The organization of the hunger brigade has not yet been seen. However, recently, incidents of poor people抢夺food and farmers riot荒have frequently occurred in various places. This is even more serious than the hunger brigade's organized petition. Last month, a famine riot occurred in Suzhou, which is a reflection of the difficult lives of farmers in general. Recently, the Shanghai Renji Hospital released a report saying: "The number of poor people in Shanghai has increased sharply last year. Half of them are due to the lack of work, and most of them are from places where there is starvation." This also shows that the living conditions of the people in our country are more difficult than in the past.</p>
<p>The organization of the unemployed hunger brigade clearly indicates the extreme plight of the general population. The power of this group is strong. If the authorities do not have adequate relief measures, the peace of society may not be maintained. The right to eat is something that everyone should have. But in today's world, there is a large group of people who are trapped on the hunger line, unable to survive and unable to live. How dangerous is this phenomenon?</p>
<h3 id="e208">The Last Lesson <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Ling Bing</p>
<p>"Teacher, don't teach from the book..."</p>
<p>"Talk about current events, teacher..."</p>
<p>When I stepped into the classroom, before I had even opened the civics textbook, more than thirty children were chattering like a flock of sparrows. I pretended to be stern, slammed my right hand heavily on the podium, and shouted:</p>
<p>"Don't make noise;"</p>
<p>The children immediately quieted down, and countless dark eyes kept rolling at me, apparently eagerly waiting for me to talk about current events.</p>
<p>"Today we will teach from the book... The books for this semester haven't been taught..."</p>
<p>The classroom boiled again like a rolling pot, and dozens of small mouths stubbornly sent out a unified request: "Talk about current events, teacher!" When a child silently opened the cover of his desk and took out a civics textbook and spread it out in front of him, the eyes of everyone around him were all directed at him, and many mouths even made a hissing sound, forcing him to blush and stuff the textbook back in its place.</p>
<p>I chuckled, but this laugh was more painful than crying.</p>
<p>"Then I'll tell you some interesting stories."</p>
<p>"No, teacher. We want to hear about current events!"</p>
<p>I stood helplessly behind the podium, coughing dryly, unable to say a word.</p>
<p>Because of the children's fervent request, I talked to them about current events several times based on newspaper materials. Unexpectedly, I was severely warned by the principal because of this. He said that someone outside the school was saying that I was always promoting something in the classroom, and he sincerely asked me not to talk about current events anymore, for the sake of the school and for his position. I nodded, smiled wryly, and didn't say a word. I fabricated a few interesting stories in painful remorse, preparing to use these stories to replace current events when necessary. But the current facts prove that my hard work to deceive the children was in vain. What else can I say?</p>
<p>"Mr. Huang, you're really too much, letting them fool around like this." The principal suddenly stepped into the classroom, raised his eyebrows and said to me. He then turned his body half a circle, straightened his face, and shouted at the children:</p>
<p>"Is this civics class or current events class? Alas!... If Mr. Huang is polite, you can fool around lawlessly? Take out your textbooks quickly."</p>
<p>A small commotion immediately arose in the classroom. Amidst the crackling sound of desks opening and closing and the rustling sound of turning pages, there was also a vague roar, which caused the principal's anger to erupt again.</p>
<p>"Who said something?" Two pairs of eyes swept across the children's faces like lightning.</p>
<p>Grave-like silence. The principal glared at them angrily, and walked away silently.</p>
<p>I wanted to say something, but I couldn't say it. I only felt my lips trembling violently. I grabbed the book and glanced at the children in front of me. They were like a flock of pitiful lambs mechanically staring at the books in front of them under invisible pressure. Their tightly frowned brows showed a kind of helpless hidden pain of daring to be angry but not daring to speak out. My heart ached as if it were being pricked by countless needles.</p>
<p>I forced myself to finish reading a paragraph of the book. It was time to explain, but I couldn't explain it, as if something was tightly gripping my throat. For the price of a twenty-dollar monthly salary, I actually sold my soul, and I didn't hesitate to inject the innocent children's veins with poison that was more deadly than arsenic. Was this right?</p>
<p>I suddenly bit my teeth, threw the textbook on the table, and shouted loudly: "Everyone close your books and listen to me talk about current events!"</p>
<p>The children shuddered at the same time, raised their heads, and opened their surprised eyes, as if asking: "Have you gone crazy, teacher?"</p>
<p>"But I tell you: this is my last lesson." So I boldly and loudly talked about this week's current events...</p>
<p>The next morning, when I stepped out of the school gate with my luggage, a group of children came to surround me, asking me why I was leaving the school.</p>
<p>"Have you forgotten what I said yesterday? 'This is my last lesson.'" I answered with a wry smile.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Tong Zi Road <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Especially</p>
<p>I thought to myself: In this well-secured city, I can sleep soundly for one big night, right?</p>
<p>A heavy stone fell from my heart. Old Tie and I were staying in the back room on the east side. The wall was really white, without a single stain. It was telling the travelers that this inn was new and hadn't been ruined yet.</p>
<p>After finishing dinner, a refreshing cool breeze blew through the streets. Based on past experience, we realized that the weather at night would change. Never mind, the three of us walked on the central road. The shops, the displays, everything gave us a novel feeling.</p>
<p>Let's go in, A Huang pointed to a shop on the right: Let's listen to two sections of storytelling and then go back.</p>
<p>A Huang was very familiar with the situation in the mountain country. He knew what was produced there and how much it cost. The storytelling hall had a long room with many canvas deck chairs lined up on both sides. In the middle, there was also a not-very-handy tea table. A narrow aisle was left in the center of the room, and an oil lamp hung from the top of the aisle. Besides these, there were only the storytelling stage at the other end and a few couplets on the wall panels.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was too early. Except for us, I didn't</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>see a fourth customer. It was strangely desolate. The old waiter with a mouthful of yellow teeth looked at us a few times with strange eyes. Maybe there were other languages in his eyes. Who knows? Waiting, waiting, half an hour slipped by. Rain, patter, fell. The storytelling stage was still lonely. When would we be able to hear the storytelling? Unwilling to continue to wait, we faced the sudden wind and rain and walked back home.</p>
<p>When it was almost time to sleep, the old servant came to this side with a wind lantern. Rainwater hung on his white beard, and his eyes, which had lost their luster, looked at everyone, panting. Without saying anything, we could know that there was a kind of hope in him.</p>
<p>—I said, Mr. Huang, he didn't dare to say it directly, smiled, shall I take the car tomorrow too?</p>
<p>—Taking the car costs five silver dollars. Old Huang also laughed.</p>
<p>No matter from which aspect, we had no reason to object, especially since the whole car was chartered! The old servant hurriedly left. Night swallowed up the entire space, and the earth was silent.</p>
<p>From Tongzi to Zunyi, this distance is not very far. It is estimated to be only about one hundred and twenty or thirty miles. If the speed of the long-distance bus is faster, then it will only take three hours to arrive.</p>
<p>Facing the dim face of dawn, we carried the items we needed to the company's bus station. The so-called bus station did not have a platform. It was only in our imagination that the buses in the mountain country were in a dilapidated state. However, the bus finally met us. The brand was Ford, and although the style was not very new, it was still passable. If you want to compare it, it is somewhat like the Shanghai-Minhang long-distance bus.</p>
<p>The driver was very young. He could speak the Shanghai dialect, fluent Mandarin, and also understood Cantonese slang. Really, distant travelers will feel closer to people from their hometown than to their own relatives. Our conversation was very speculative, and we opened up the unfamiliar wooden wall. He told us about the length of time he had worked here and the situation, the dynamics of this society and the local customs; talking, talking, without letting hypocrisy stay at all. I don't know how, the topic turned to future prospects. His face sank, he shook his head, and sighed deeply twice.</p>
<p>This gave us a hint that life in the mountain country was not easy after all!</p>
<p>The old servant hurried over. In addition to the cane, he also had a kerosene iron box. He put these two treasures on the bus, and also helped to tie them up and arrange them. The small pieces were placed in the car, and the long pieces were tied on the roof and sides of the car.</p>
<p>The car rushed out of the city amidst the crowd's watching, like a fierce tiger, rushing up the endless highway.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Under the Lamp <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Ma Jun</p>
<p>Jumping out of the rickshaw and paying the fare, he hurriedly escaped into the alley as if escaping from a demon. When he stopped in front of his door, he took out the key to open the door and went in without even ringing the doorbell. Stepping into the living room, the clock had just struck nine, and he finally breathed a sigh of relief. He took a cigarette from the tobacco jar on the table, lit it with a lighter, and ran upstairs. He met his wife coming out of the telephone room on the half-stairway, but she went upstairs to her room as if she hadn't seen him. So he rushed up in one stride, shouting:</p>
<p>"Hurry up, it's already nine o'clock."</p>
<p>His wife had a tight face and was already sitting on the sofa. Seeing this situation, he slowed down his pace at the doorway, slowly walked to his wife's side, and gently patted his wife's shoulder like every good husband, saying, "Isn't there still time? What are you angry about?"</p>
<p>His wife pursed her lips at him and turned her face in the opposite direction from her husband, as if talking to herself: "Leaving the office at six o'clock and not coming back until this time."</p>
<p>Understanding this, the husband shrugged his shoulders lightly, sat on the armrest of the sofa, and deliberately slickly faced his wife's face, saying in a low voice:</p>
<p>"Let's go see the play first, I'll tell you about the company's business later." He grabbed his wife's arm and wanted to pull her up, but his wife angrily shook his hand away, threw her body to the other corner of the sofa, and stared out the window. Outside the window was a dark sky without a moon.</p>
<p>The husband stood up, threw the cigarette butt out the window, and rubbed his hands, like when he encountered difficult situations in the company. He walked around the table in circles, his leather shoes squeaking, but he couldn't bear to explain to his wife the reason for coming back late in the simplest words. The stammering things almost confused his mind. "What do you women know?" He couldn't help but blurt out.</p>
<p>His wife immediately turned over from the corner of the sofa, repeating his words, "What do you women know? Women don't understand these things anyway. Leaving the office at six o'clock and not coming back until nine——o'clock." She dragged the end of the sound out long and made people uncomfortable.</p>
<p>"Okay, I was wrong." The husband still walked gently to his wife's side, "Let's go, it's about to start, this is the last show."</p>
<p>"I don't want to watch!" His wife turned her head to stare out the window again, "Today is like tomorrow, and tomorrow is like today. What exactly are you busy with? When I call the company, I can't find your shadow at all. Humph, you think I don't know..."</p>
<p>"Yin, what are you talking about?" The husband just raised his voice, but immediately lowered it again: "Didn't I tell you? My business is not just sitting in the office. So many things need me to arrange."</p>
<p>"I just don't know what these..." His wife's throat raised instead, "I have never heard of a manager running around the streets like a street vendor!"</p>
<p>The husband waved his hand, feeling like there was no reason to understand? He sat on the chair in front of the window, casually dragged the newspaper of the day and flipped through it, completely forgetting about watching the movie, and not paying attention to his wife's actions. His mind was spinning with that deal again: the telegram that the ship in Changsha had not set sail, while the Hakka in Shanghai urged the ship to leave, but he couldn't let go of this sale. It would be a small loss if his ship came back without goods, and he couldn't let other companies easily pull away his account in such a declining market. He discussed this matter with the Hakka this afternoon, and he asked the Hakka to wait until tonight. If there was no telegram from Changsha again, he would have no way to hold on to this account. But he also remembered that his wife wanted to watch that movie, and today was the last show. At half past eight, he left the restaurant where he was treating the Hakka to dinner, hurried to the company and ordered the night staff to call his home as soon as they received the telegram, and then hurried home by car, but what do women know: Thinking, he threw the newspaper and habitually rubbed his hands again.</p>
<p>His wife didn't expect her husband to be so indifferent to her, and she was even more certain that her guess was not wrong. Her husband loved her, but lately her husband hadn't come home early for a single day. That movie had been showing for a week, but it was always tomorrow, like tomorrow, and when she called the company, she couldn't find anyone. She was sure that her husband had changed his mind, and she buried her head and cried sadly.</p>
<p>At this time, the bell in the telephone room rang. The husband was worried about the telegram and immediately jumped out of the room, but his wife rushed down the stairs ahead of him. The husband stood at the doorway, pricking up his ears to listen to the sounds below. What he hoped for was the telegram from Changsha, but he couldn't hear what his wife was saying in the telephone room. After a while, he saw his wife walking upstairs, turning past him, and saying as if to another person: "The telegram from Changsha has arrived. The Hakka is waiting for you at the company to discuss."</p>
<p>The husband immediately wanted to run downstairs, but he went back into the room again, walked behind his wife, and gently stroked her shoulder, saying: "Isn't that right? Those things are enough to keep people busy! I'll get it done today and take you to see a movie tomorrow."</p>
<p>"Go on." His wife let go of his body and asked, "What are you doing tomorrow?"</p>
<p>His wife's smiling face was reflected again under the silver light.</p>
<h3 id="e211">A Toss <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Nan</p>
<p>The early summer breeze brushed across people's faces. At dusk, Avenue Joffre was filled with a romantic atmosphere. Under the shimmering neon lights, the red lips, dark circles, and long eyelashes of enchanting women floated by. A young man pursed his lips and whistled a tune popular in the dance halls, matching it with his footsteps, passing by sweetly, passionately, joyfully, and lightly. Dusk is the beginning of the day in the metropolis.</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>I skillfully maneuvered through the crowd, a sea of people. There were glamorous noblewomen and peaceful night gentlemen, and an old man with eight-hundred-degree nearsighted glasses, hurriedly recording the results of a game. A Filipino with a sideways cap, his hands thrust into his trouser pockets, paced back and forth impatiently. The fervent atmosphere and the clamorous voices made me feel anxiously hungry.</p>
<p>The heroes on the court—toys of fate—were active again, flashes of red clothing, flashes of green clothing, flashes of clothing of various colors. The ball flew with these flashes of red and green, making rhythmic sounds, striking again and again at the tense heartstrings of the gamblers, shattering the hopes of many. Although occasionally it struck the hearts of some who were waiting, causing them to emit a joyful smile. The referee's whistle was like the verdict of a judge. In a single whistle, the hopes of many were destroyed; in a single whistle, the fate of many was pronounced. Hope hung in the corners of everyone's eyes, and this hope permeated golden dreams. Life would leap with the flashes of red and green, and fate was being hammered by the sound of the ball.</p>
<p>Although it was already midnight, the people in the stadium had long lost their sense of time. The atmosphere was exceptionally fervent, and the voices were even more clamorous. I transferred the last two one-yuan banknotes from my right hand to my left, and then casually grabbed a handful of copper coins from my pocket, the money I had prepared for the ride home, to count them, to decide this last destiny.</p>
<p>One, two, three... thirteen. Thirteen is an unlucky number! I'd better buy number two! I angrily threw the last two banknotes onto the ticket counter and exchanged them for a number two ticket.</p>
<p>Hope was very渺茫. I seemed to know that these last two yuan would not bloom into beautiful flowers. However, before knowing the result, no one could say that all hope was lost. I deliberately turned my head back, wanting to forget that there was still a glimmer of hope, and prepared to be indifferent, when suddenly I heard the joyful announcement of number two's victory.</p>
<p>Flashes of red clothing, flashes of green clothing, flashes of clothing of various colors. The ball flew with these flashes of red and green. Number two and number three each scored four points, creating the most tense situation. A trembling heart could not stop it from leaping with the flight of the ball. I subconsciously squeezed the ticket in my hand tightly into a long, thin strip. Everyone held their breath, waiting for the fate to come. A few minutes later, a whistle ended this tense scene. Everyone's fate followed, like the buzzing of ten thousand flies trapped in a cage, unable to fly. Everything was boiling over, and everything that was dead was revived. Like a pair of defeated roosters, I staggered out of the stadium.</p>
<p>Stepping on the midnight pavement, there was a bit of desolate meaning. Looking at the distant streetlights, it was like having a dream. I hoped to see the sun of the next day immediately.</p>

<p>Opening "Chai Tou Feng"</p>
<p>Passionate love is always foolish. Ill-fated beauties have been spoken of since ancient times. I, Xianxian, lost my parents at a young age and had no one to rely on. I was raised as a lonely adopted daughter until I reached adulthood. The engagement with my cousin was originally a matter of righteousness. The whole family happily spent their days. What was even more pleasing was that my cousin's affection was also deep. He whispered sweet words of tenderness. Only to hate, the greedy Buddhist nun not being successful in begging. Only to regret. I politely declined, thus forming a deep hatred. The Chai Tou Feng, broken and fallen, was it intentional? It stirred up an extraordinary disaster. The manipulation was nothing more than revenge. The Buddhist nun should be killed. Vile words accused my mother of harming me. I bore countless hardships and grievances. My aunt's anger did not subside and changed even more. She actually made me live alone in a Buddhist temple, suffering abuse. The evil nun would entice me to vile deeds. I vowed to uphold my chastity and would not comply. My husband knew nothing and went far away to take the exam. Ten thousand kinds of sorrows, to whom could I express them? Langli returned and was fortunate to meet me. I was even more sad, recalling the lotus blossoms on the same stalk, difficult to achieve. Alas, I am endowed with a heart-rending tale that I cannot bear to read. Alas, my tears fall drop by drop, warming my silk handkerchief. Alas, I think about the past and the future, difficult to dream. Alas, I toss and turn all night, sleepless. Alas, I fear to face the mirror with my haggard face. Alas, I am entangled in bed, truly sick. Alas, may Kun Peng continue to remind me. Alas, I revive from death, my mother-in-law calling me. I cannot greet her morning and evening. I wish to at least unfold my brow. I must forgive my unfilial name. I sigh that my karmic fate was determined in a previous life. Why must I resent others for the torment? I only hope that heaven knows my intention. The gatherings and separations in life are like floating duckweed. I will willingly close my eyes and go to the underworld.</p>

<p>The vast blue sky gradually fades into dusk. A rustling breeze and fine rain sprinkle down. The dim Dai Yu's voice is silent. The desolate, slender bamboo casts a deep shadow. The affectionate Jia Baoyu cares deeply. He is worried about the sentimental and sickly woman. He hastily gets dressed and puts on his belt. Holding a lamp, he hurriedly walks to the garden. He has already arrived at the Xiang Pavilion. The young lady is, composing poetry, putting down her pen. The maid suddenly reports that the second master is here. She sees that his attire today is different from usual. Wide and loose, what is the matter, why emulate the fisherman's form? Baoyu, hearing this, hurriedly asks. Sister, are you at peace? Can you take medicine, can you eat more rice? Recently, you must not recite poetry. I am always worried, so I brave the rain to see you. Sister, you cannot bear this attire. I will send you a set on a later date. Daiyu replies, why do you need this? The image of a fisherman is truly meaningless. As the words leave her mouth. She silently thinks. Fishermen and fisherwomen should not be spoken of. Her peach blossom face flushes with a hard-to-hide blush. She silently lowers her head and says nothing. One is, unintentionally speaking wrongly, the other is, not hearing the truth, how would she know the affection, The Dream of the Red Chamber is full of transformations. I'll briefly mention that, Asking About the Illness, a section of the love story between Daiyu and Baoyu. I hate that the old matchmaker does not tie the threads of love. Hence, the medicine is useless, bearing two hearts.</p>

<h3 id="e215">"Prisoner of Shark Island" Opens <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>Elected as one of the world's top ten blockbusters of the year</p>
<p>The historical and artistic epic "Prisoner of Shark Island," produced by 20th Century Fox with all its strength, is scheduled to premiere at the Grand Theater tonight (Wednesday) at 9:15 PM. The film tells the story of a noble doctor who is wrongly imprisoned for the assassination of Lincoln. Trapped on a remote island, far from his beloved wife and daughter, he endures an inhuman life. Relentless bullets, man-eating sharks, raging waves, and vicious demons all attack him. The plot is sorrowful and tense, enough to stand shoulder to shoulder with So-Oh's "Tears of the Stars" and Dumas' "The Count of Monte Cristo." Warner's performance in this film is also his greatest success ever. This is indeed a fine film that is capable of making everyone shed tears.</p>
<h3 id="e216">"These Three" to be Released <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>Starring Merle Oberon and Miriam Hopkins</p>
<p>United Artists' latest production, the artistic and tragic film "These Three," is a successful film in every aspect. Goldwyn's production, Hellman's script, William Wyler's direction, and the acting of Merle Oberon (the star of "The Dark Angel"), Miriam Hopkins (the star of "Vanity Fair"), and others are simply all successful. There are also child stars Bonita Granville and Marcia Mae Jones, who have even more unexpected success. Indeed, they are the discovered little stars of the year. The story is adapted from the famous Broadway stage play "The Children's Hour," which is very stimulating and moving. Merle and Miriam share a doctor, which leads to many disputes, and the future of the three is ruined. The film is scheduled to be released at the International Theater starting on Friday.</p>
