<h3>德日同盟與遠東政局</h3>
<p>— 朗</p>
<p>德日同盟的消息已經傳布了許多决數。日前巴爾的摩太陽報記者潘脫遜（Patterson）由日抵滬又。發表了一個驚人消息。說德日二國已於二星期前締訂同盟條約。共同對對蘇聯。潘氏舉出許多事實。證明德日確已締訂同盟條約。並謂不久卽將由廣田首相與有田外相提交樞密院。大約在下月二十四日議會開幕以前。將有聲明發表。潘氏談話發表後。德日二方雖都表示否認。不過意大利政府半官報意大利日報也刊登一個消息。說德日同盟業已成立。日本已加入反蘇聯的共同陣綫。從各方面消息看來。德國同盟條約的締訂。大概已有七八分證實了。</p>
<p>我們暫且不問德日司盟條約已吾正式成立而。來討論德日二國有吾成立同盟的可能性。只要稍為明瞭近年國際形勢發展的人。都知道德日兩國有成立同盟條約的極大可能性。這個極大可能性就存在於二國反蘇聯的共同立塲上。德國的反蘇聯政策。我們從希特勒與郭培爾箏國社煎要人的演說中。已經聽得很多了。不久以前在紐倫堡舉行的國社黨大會。就是一個反蘇聯十字軍大會。德國之所以這樣積極進行反蘇聯的運動主要的原因。一方面因為共產主義本為國社主義的死敵。一方面是想以反蘇聯的政策。去博取其他帝國主義國家對於德國軍擴計劃的同情。德國不但自己積極進行反蘇聯運動。而且還聯合利害相同的歐洲國家。結成國際反蘇聯的十字軍。十月下旬意德談話的結果。已使意國重新開始其反蘇聯的工作。奧匈諸國也在最近維也納會議後加入反蘇聯的共同陣線。</p>
<p>但是反蘇聯十字軍如果單從東歐方面去進攻蘇聯。那是不易致蘇聯的死命的。因此他們就不得不去聯合遠東的日本。來共同夾攻蘇聯了。恰好日本也正如德國一樣的。一方面為着鞏固其統治階層的地位。一方面為掩護其進攻中國的軍事行動。早已採取反蘇聯的政策。而以東方的反共先鋒隊自任。在這個反蘇聯的共同立塲上。這東西二大法西斯國家自然極有携手合作的可能。只等時機成熟。他們就可從東西二方去夾攻蘇聯了。</p>
<p>德日同盟如果成立。對於世界和平自然是一個重大的打擊。因為我們不問蘇聯所行的主義如何。但其近年對於國際和平的努力。却是有目共睹的。德日同盟的成立。不但嚴重威脅世界的和平。而且因地理上的關係。對於我國也有極大的影響。近年日本帝國主義的進攻中國。侵佔東北領土。對外總是宣傳說。他們的行動是為防止蘇聯勢力的發展。藉以博取西歐各國的同情。現在如果反蘇聯的德日同盟訂立後。那末日本以後就可更進一步的侵略我們的領土。以作反蘇聯的準備了。東京的壓迫我們締訂防共協定。也就是為要驅使我們去做他們反蘇聯的犧牲者。最近偽蒙聯合軍的進攻綏遠。一方面固然是為擴充其背後主人的勢力。奪取我們僅存的國防第一綫。一方面也就是想佔領綏遠以做將來進攻蘇聯的根據地。所以德日同盟成立後。日本帝國主義者的進攻中國。必然要更進一步了。</p>
<h3>日德進行談判　締結反俄同盟　軍事密約傳已舉行草簽　俄在東西國境鞏固防務</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）據蘇俄官方機關塔斯通訊社所發表之可靠消息、內稱、昨日蘇俄駐東京大使已由日外相有田口中、探知日本與某强國組織同盟以防共產之談判、目下已在進行中、惟有田否認曾締結任何以蘇俄為對象之協定、同時日外相官稱、日本現時正力謀與蘇俄成立密切及更親善之關係、日本與第三國之談判、對於日俄關係、並無直接或間接之影響云、塔斯社又稱、頃根據同上之可靠來源、已知所謂第三國者、决為德國無疑、並謂一種對付蘇俄之協定、現已在東京簽第一字矣、該協定之內容、表面上雖以互相防共為目的、但實際上係為日德兩國另一種秘密條約之烟幕彈、此項密的係修正簽字國一方或雙方與第三國發生戰爭時、彼此採取一致之行動云、莫斯科方面接獲上項消息之後、並不引以為驚異、蓋自希特勒執政以來、蘇俄即深信日德兩國之間、必有此種諒解之存在也、去年蘇俄人民委員會主席莫洛托夫氏呈中央執行委員會之正式報吿書中、已提及日德間有一種協定之存在、蘇俄政府卽根據此種傳聞、遠東及西部兩邊境、有同時被攻之虞、故在東烏拉爾叢山中、建立規模　海陸軍根據地、以免紅軍之力量受有牽制云、（十八日路透電）</p>
<h3>英外相　延見日使　探詢日德協定真相　倫敦政界印象不佳</h3>
<p>（倫敦）據此間泰晤士報載稱、英外相艾登曾於星期一在外交部與日本駐英大使吉田會晤、並表示英國頗願獲知關於外傳日德兩政府所訂恊定之消息云、英國官方之意見、均以為此項協定確有其事、並信其內容的分二部、（一）以德國軍火及製造軍火之機械、交換日本之商品、（二）一種政治性質之協定、大的除兩國發表聯合防共之宣言外、不致另有所（　八日路透）</p>
<p>（倫敦）據今日此間外交界人士所知、蘇俄官員現已獲有情報、證明上海及東京方面所傳之德日軍事同盟、並非無因、據稱此項同盟表面上將為一種反對共產主義之共同宣言、但據蘇俄所得情報、德日同盟全文將守秘密、所公佈者僅為共同反赤一部份、（十七日國民）</p>
<p>（倫敦）德國與日本卽將成立反共協定一項消息傳至此問之後、一般印象尤其是政界印象、極為惡劣、咸謂意大利他日加入此項協定時、英意兩國現所進行之談話、定必大受妨害、英國所由圖謀與意國互相接近者、主要目的之一、卽在防止「理論上之離異、此固英國輿論所竭力反對、卽海相霍爾爵士昨在外國新聞記者聯合會席上亦曾加以指斥也云、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>德日將發　共同宣言　兩國防共利害相同</h3>
<p>（柏林）此間官塲今日雖否認日德二國已訂立軍事同盟、但承認此事「絕對可以想像、」並稱日德二國　於共產主義利害相同、惟此種條約應稱之為反共同盟、而非反蘇同盟（十七日國民電）</p>
<p>（柏林）政界若干人士頃盛傳德日兩國不日當發表共同官言書、其性質極為重要、但此項消息尙未正式證實、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>字林報云、星期二日有滬僑某氏由日歸來、據稱、日當局對於報紙雖嚴厲檢查、而外間廣傳日政府已與德意兩國締結共同防共之特別協的、衆信與德國所訂之的、將於下月初簽字、其中含有重要商業條欵、最著者為設立商品交換所、日本以大豆供給德國、德國則以軍械子彈供給日本、德日之的一經簽定、意國亦將加入、東京外務省對於此事雖嚴守緘默、而無法向之探知關於此事之消息、但密切觀察時局者皆信該的簽字在卽云、</p>
<p>按德當局對於德日訂的之說曾加否認、但近兩日內倫敦已廣傳此事、據屋期二夜之消息、倫敦人士多信德日兩國間必有此舉、大英無綫電臺廣播懷愛德爵士兩週外務談話、特別注重此事、謂此與希特勒氏最近否認凡爾賽和的之宣言有關、惟據爵士之意、德日兩國未必締結正式同盟、今或互謀親善耳、蓋德國雅不欲以質言予日本、因希特勒氏曾迭决宣布願與英國維持女交、恐為人認此為對英國之威脅也、德日兩國間如有所謀、决非希圖危害英國之海上交通、大約乃求保障德日之合作、以對付由歐洲達亞細亞洲太平洋濱之陸地巨大堅固之障礙云、</p>
<h3>英報論評　行動失却自由　日本得不償失</h3>
<p>（倫敦）泰晤士報對於日德諒解事、著論批評、略謂日本之善於模倣、固為世人所共知、但其最近之投機事業、恐不能預卜能如以前仿傚西方各事之獲利、該報復稱、外傳日德之同盟如正式發表、必將稱為一種純粹防禦之性質、惟蘇俄目下之志願確係和平、蘇俄曾向日本提出不侵略公約之意見、而竟為日本所拒絕、該報續云若就最後之分析而論、日人之措辭固不得為非、但蘇俄之侵略目下尙未實現、一國之修戰備、自不能皆以侵略目之也」云云、日本近來之舉動、已使日俄之緊張關係日趨緩和、而其此次與德國之新結合、又將引起一般人之憂慮、認為俄方西部邊境附近一帶、從此又為愁雲所籠罩矣、日本目下已獲新交兩名、皆具有「承認明顯現實」之嗜好、故對於簽署國際協定卽有東縛義務之成語、皆無接受之傾向、因此日本與蘇俄之關係、乃轉趨不諧、日本自身之行動自由亦受妨害、所得顯然難償其所失、日本更因此而使英日兩國之親善前途、發生障礙、蓋以英國平日之政策、向不欲牽入無謂之糾紛也、（十八日路透電）</p>

<p>（羅馬）半官方面機關報意大利日報頃發表重要消息謂、德日兩國業已成立協定、由日本加入意德兩國前所成立之反共產陣綫、其言略謂、「此項反共產陣綫、乃係意德兩國前在柏林談話時有樹立、嗣在意奧匈三國維也納會議中、又將奧匈兩國包括在內、未及匝月並已推及遠東、而由日本參加其間、查第三國際去年七八月間舉行大會、其所進行之工作、不啻向法西斯主義國家公開官戰、意德日三國此項結合、乃係反對共產主義之防衛行動、其目的係在保障世界文化最偉大之成就、以及各國精神物質上之健全、實卽蘇聯共產主義所採侵略計劃之自然結果也」云云、按意國報紙述及日德兩國成立恊定者、僅有意大利日報一家、政界人士聲稱、此事現僅有外國方面消息可據、未能加以瞪實、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>主席致詞</p>
<p>席間主席林康侯致詞云、今日本會等六團體在此開會、歡迎南洋商業考察團返國、南洋考察團於七月中旬出國、歷經南洋各地、雖各地僑胞、對祖國情緖各異、本人以爲如類此團體、不時前往宣傳、必能得到相當成效、本會等爲慰勞諸君爲國宣勞起見、薄具組餐、請各盡量指敎云、</p>
<p>王氏演辭</p>
<p>次王曉籟致詞云、各位出國時，內政外交、均在極度困難時期、今日返國、國內一切情形、差堪吿慰於諸君、大凡國家之結構、不外三要素、（一）土地、（二）人民（三）物產、過去所謂暹羅考察團出國、僅由本人前去宣傳、而此次貴團以人才貨物前往實地宣傳、尙屬初創見到團長報吿南洋民衆、對我國貨發生疑問、以爲中國無國貨之出產、今因此而使當地民衆有深切認識、厥功殊偉、希望此後不時有此種團體出國宣傳、以期普遍、吾人深知努力才可使事業潑展、有了努力、出超入超問題、經濟問題、均可迎刃而解云、</p>
<p>團長報告</p>
<p>南洋考察團團長高事恒報吿云、國人頗注意於南洋商業考察團之結果、蓋以中國與南洋間、雖具有數白年之貿易歷史、往者均屬個人之經營、絕少有團體之派遣、故彼此間殊隔膜、大戰以前、華僑地位鞏固、產業發達、白歐戰終了、世界各國爭覓市塲、南洋成爲工業之尾閭、尤其某國、全力傾銷、十年間盡佔市塲、吾華僑之地位、因被刦奪、即宗主國之歐人、亦相顧失色、時至今日、華僑痛祖國之危急、極欲爲國貨謀出路、吾人因知南洋華僑大部屬商人、無論輸入批發零售、均操其手中、商人之目的、爲販售謀利、固然愛國之觀念、人人有之、但供應貨物之責任、與乎價格能否競爭於市塲、則全在祖國之工業界、南洋有一億二千萬人口之消費、華僑佔六百萬、佔總人口百分之五、對華僑固可言愛國、勸用國貨、在土人之眼光、初無國界、但求價廉物美、華僑商店爲消費者之仲賣人、固不能不爲其設法、誰無祖國、孰不愛國、使國貨而能競爭於國際市塲、則僑商常然樂於推銷、且爲最好之推銷員故國貨之能否推銷於南洋、視國內工業界是否有奮鬥之能力耳、以言吾國工業之進步、近五年、經工業與新興工業之勃興、亟須對外謀出路、同時、在國家經濟立塲言、每年鉅額人超、海外貿易、卽所以抵補入超之唯一工具、歐美工業發達、吾少挿足之地、惟南洋爲農產國家、需要工業品之輸入、具有堅耐之洧費性質、吾旣有僑胞爲開路先鋒、是任何國家所求之不得之優良條件、故吾國不欲推廣海外貿易則已、如其欲謀出路、捨南洋其道末由、此爲吾人自南洋歸來而深信之、茲爲闡明上述之原則、特分別言之、</p>
<p>南洋僑胞所佔之地位所謂南洋者、包括美屬菲律濱羣島。荷屬東印度。英屬馬來亞·及婆羅洲·英屬緬甸。法屬越南·及暹羅帝汶島、上述之領土、除羅暹爲獨立國外、其餘均屬白種人之殖民地、全南洋人口計一億二千四百三十七萬人、內華僑佔六百十五萬五千人、佔總額百分之五、以地域分、則美屬菲律濱、計總人口一千三百六十三萬人、內華僑十一萬人、荷屬東印度、計六千零七十二萬人、內華僑計一百二十三萬三千人、英屬馬來亞四百四十一萬人、內華僑計一百六十四萬八千人、英屬緬甸、計一千三百十二萬一千人、內華僑佔十九萬三千人、法屬越南、計人口一千九百六十三萬人、內華僑佔三十九萬一千人、暹羅計有人口一千二百七十四萬人、華僑佔二百五十萬人、然華僑之分配、在各重要都市、計新加披四十萬七千人、檳城十一萬八千人、雪蘭（吉隆坡）二十萬四千人、闢靂（怡保）三十萬七千人、巴達維亞七萬八千人、泗水三萬八千人、三寶壟二萬七千人、棉蘭二萬七千人、曼谷四十萬人、西貢十二萬二千人、此鉅額之人口、分布全南洋各地、吾人每至一地、均係中國風土、幾忘置身異國、偉大哉、吾國之華僑、</p>
<p>華僑所經營之事業各地華僑經營之事業、因環境與產業關係而異、英屬馬來亞以新加坡爲中心、本爲自由口岸、地廣人稀、歡迎移民、吾僑之從事於錫鑛及橡膠而起家者、不知數千萬人、自一九三二年起、雖受不景氣影響、現漸有恢復之勢、大城市商店、幾盡爲華僑所設、因土人不善經商也、勞動工人、除政府之公共事業及工程、由印度移民外、吾華僑佔大部分、荷屬東印度之政策、顯然與英屬不同、對於入境、須納一百五十盾人頭稅、的合國幣二百八十元、中人之家、何能負担、故吾國之栘民、爲之减少、吾僑之在荷屬、以經營糖業爲最鉅、其他則屬於批發商、（淮口商均在歐人手中）及另售商勞動人役、以開鑛及種植爲多數、美屬菲律濱華僑、頗佔高尙地位、有銀行及木材公司等大規模之經營、全菲華僑投資、據菲農商部一九三二年總計有四八二·〇〇〇·三一三菲幣之鉅、而另售商如中國之雜貨店、菲人所謂「業亞」店幾全在吾僑之手中、但菲人程度日高、議會中常有不利華人之提議、是前途之荊棘也、暹羅僑胞、以經營米業爲大宗、所謂火聲者、卽碾米廠、幾全在華僑手中、且米爲暹羅惟一命脈、則其與華僑之關係可知、暹人不善經商、一切商店、均屬華僑、而暹政府人員中、大多有中國血　、無論大都市或小鄕鎭、均中國人之世界其在經濟上地位不言而喩矣、法屬之越南、華　之經濟勢力、有逐漸崩潰之勢、法人採取絕對保護政策、排除外貨、卽日貨亦爲之搖頭、在一九二七年前、中國與越南有特殊之條約、舊約到期、新的成立、經營國貨者、完全失敗、惟米業尙在華僑之手中、勉可支持、總之、華僑在海外之地位、一、因當地政府之力謀保護土人利益、二、土人知識日高、有自行振作之趨勢、三、某國人日謀擴張商塲之地盤、因此吾僑除自力更生之外、全賴有强固之政府、爲之後盾、實爲今日華僑所切盼也、</p>
<p>華僑之敎育狀况華僑有敎育、自康有爲到南洋提倡後、始創辦學校、十年以來、更有進步之趨勢、考察團所至各地、深覺國語之通行、反覺較國內爲普遍、皆學校之功也、對於學生之活潑健康樸素、較之國內學生、有足多者、惟華僑之辦敎育、係寄人籬下、據本團秘書敎育專家楊崇臯君、對於各領土內敎育批評結論、謂菲律濱係雙重敎育、卽上午須上不論何種科學英文課、下午又須上國文課、荷屬東印度、係限制敎育、對於敎材之屬於愛國思想者、一概不許、限制之度、無可比喩、學校被封、敎員被驅逐出境、時有所聞、英屬馬來亞、係監督敎育、取自由主義、而加以監督、未聞華僑能讀祖國書而反對英國、此亦英人之聰明、暹羅係同化敎育、即每學生必須讀暹文、敎員必須知暹文、其目的使同化於暹羅、因此種種關係、敎育之普遍、而有成效、當推馬來亞也、華僑頗願送其子女返祖國、求高深造詣、惟希望國內有嚴格管理、而適合華僑性格之學校、華僑家庭、深不放心子女之放任、則保護之責、有賴學校當局也、</p>
<p>華僑對於祖國之觀念華僑之往自祖國者、比較明瞭國內情形、僑生當地者、旣無國家難念、甚且同化於當地人種、或崇拜宗主之國家、近十年來、中國與南洋間往來、較爲頻繁、敎育亦日漸發達、增加愛國觀念、吾惟一領袖蔣委員長之苦幹爲國、給他們良好印象、昔日、有少數報紙、反對中央論調者、現一律改變作風、全力來擁護他們的觀念、在今日之中國、危險萬分現狀下、惟有全國人民、一心一力、來擁護領袖、保護國家、他們的愛國情緖、由煩燥進而沉著此次欺捐購機祝蔣委員長壽即可證明之所以最近之僑胞、已移轉其心理、歸向祖國、此考察團各地舉行國貨展覽會、參加者多訝然而表示驚奇、以爲他方纔明瞭祖國亦有工業、給他們良好印像吾希望政府、能因勢利導、僑胞誠祖國之堅城也、各地領館之今昔　領事館卽商務官、事實上與商界應取得密切聯絡、方能顯出眞正的功能、此次考察團所經各地、領館全體人員、均動員合作、使考察團得到極多便利、這可證明吾駐外領館之進步一斑、據僑胞見吿、謂昔日領館、祇有招牌一塊、今吾領館、能謀僑胞辛福、夫以吾國家之國勢、與領館之經費、均有問題、全賴當局之活動能力、吾人希望以後、隨時與領館取聯絡、謀國際貿易之進展、對各領事館之奮鬭努力、尤致拳拳之意也、</p>
<p>南洋商業市塲之剖視大戰前後、爲南洋市塲之黃金時代、迨不景氣儘　世界後、南洋不能例外、自一九三一年起、橡膠及錫之跌價、予南洋商業以重大打擊、僑胞商店、因之破產者甚多、一九三五年起、巳漸有起色、土人不知營商、在過去僑胞之櫛風沐雨、憑民族耐苦耐勞之天性、建築了偉大之商業根基、今則時勢不同、各方競爭頗烈、華僑非自覺自奮、恐祖宗之遺澤、有消滅之虞、對於南洋市塲，可分別言之、（一）菲列濱爲美之保護國、凡美國貨品入口、受免稅之優惠、但日貨競爭甚烈、其價格較免稅之美貨反爲低廉、不但美國爲之括目、他國將退避三舍、國貨除棉織物及食品一類外、未見發展、中國對菲、居於出超地位、（二）荷屬東印度、實一良好之市塲、因鑒於外貨之傾銷、其母國貨品、反較落後、乃自一九三四年起、實行統制貿易、限制外貨輸入、除與荷蘭訂有商的、交換貨品、在限制內、准許輸入外、其他國均受限制、中國貨品、亦在限制之列、日本會與荷印數度談判、分配市塲、未吿成功、（三）馬來亞爲一自由港口、其出產之豐富、造成極大消費力之局面、日貨競爭頗烈、使英國蘭開夏·孟却斯德。之棉布市塲震動、因此有一九三四年之布疋、限制輸入、據一般觀察、恐其他各貨、漸有被限制之可能、中國貨因華僑之衆多、頗有銷路、但終不及日貨之湧暢、（四）中國對暹羅爲入超之國家、因每年購入暹米、爲數頗鉅、暹羅尙爲一農業國家、需要大量工業品、對各國待遇、均一律平等、中國貨在暹羅、可稱絕少、具有五分之一華僑之國家、而國貨未能暢銷、實屬可惜、其實極有促進之機會、（五）法屬越南、一味保護法貨政策、關稅之重、世界無與比倫正稅之外、另加種種附稅、任何國家、在越南恐少發展希望、此南洋各地市塲大概也、</p>
<p>國貨在甫洋之地位國貨在南洋可稱毫無地位、事實上、經考察團之調查結果、與僑商研究辦法、發覺國貨頗有在南洋推動之機會、在過去中國工商界、祇稱南洋無希望、旣不講求病源、亦不設法推動、祇憑人云吾云、考察團所携帶三十七家工廠之展覽品中、有多數貨品、從未向南洋介紹、而事實上頗可推動、則中國之新興工業、何祗千種、南洋商人、旣未明瞭中國情形、中國工廠、又不向南洋推進、則如何可望其發達、在國際貿易立塲言、本非一椿簡易事情、須具有相當經騐與學識、方克有濟、而時期亦彼此不同、不能推銷於數年前、或能推銷於現在、全在吾人之如何努力耳？</p>
<p>中國工業界今後應如何　中國工業界今後欲在南洋佔一席地、至少應有三項條件、一·價値能加入國際競爭市塲、換言之、卽謀成本之减低、使定價能廉、二·式樣能適合當地銷路、卽須合乎各地土人之嗜好、一切裝璜品質、務適於環境之需要、三·須有整個的計劃、或同業整個集團、旣可謀開支之節省、又能增厚力量、且能進行各種大衆需要之工作及報吿、此外關於應請求於政府有二點、一。開闢南洋航綫、吾人固知航海事業、坐定虧本、但付鉅欵之運費於外人、不如自謀收轉、姑無論輪船公司之如何虧本、但能利源不致外溢、二·各地設置銀行、中國銀行之設立新加坡銀行、予僑胞以良好印象、希望能遍及南洋各地、同時請减輕利率及押匯便利、則南洋貿易、在官商合作下、不難日臻發展、南洋華僑、除自廣東福建移去外、其他各方面、如今未能十分了解、以爲南洋地居熱帶、一定熱得火一般、一而　魚虎豺之可怕、給人以深刻印像，其實南洋氣候、最高不過九十五度、最低七十二度、平均在八十度之間、較之上海夏季、來得舒服、四季皆靑、有山有海、眞是世界之樂園、除了不開闢的地方、有　魚虎豹外、眞是安居樂業、道不拾遺、夜不閉戶、政治與治安之良好、眞是羨慕、國人之赴南洋者、最感麻煩，卽爲入境手續之困難、此點由團體的立塲來設法解决、使能辦理得當、亦無困難可言、最後吾獨望經此次南洋考察團幹了一番播種工作、望國人予以指敎、更希望吾國與南洋間、更有密切之聯絡、則其收穫、必可在預料中也最後、本人此次在南洋一帶最深刻之感想、以南洋各地除暹羅外、均爲被征服之亡國民族、各殖民地政府對待之手段、恐此種民族、永無復興之機、故國家在重要關頭、人民必須全力保護國家、若亡國之後、無論貧富，均屬做牛馬生活、今日中國、雖尙未至此緊要關頭、本人因目擊各亡國民族之殷鑒、而今日到會諸領袖、均是上海最有力工商機關、亦卽代表全工商界之意志、在目前局勢、惟有最要兩點、應予注意、一、一致加緊擁護吾們唯一領袖蔣委員長、全國在領導下起來救國、二、請各公團速即起來、對綏東守土抗戰之傳作義將軍、加以竭力援助、</p>

<h3>上海市禁烟委員會為　禁毒宣傳吿市民書</h3>
<p>親愛的市民們、</p>
<p>今日爲本市各界禁毒宜傳週的第十天、自明年起、所有吸毒的同胞、若不從速戒絕、給政府捉到了、就要執行死刑、本會趁此機會、應有最後的忠吿、希望吸毒者覺悟、</p>
<p>自從淸代末年，一直到了民國、因爲軍閥當局、實行其不澈底的禁烟政策的結果、除了烟禍依然猖獗外、同時又發現各種名稱不同的鴉片代用品、什麽槍上戒烟丸、戒毒金丹、藥水針、種種好聽的名詞、一般惑於宣傳而意志薄弱的烟民、吸用的結朵、非但烟癮未除、反而毒癮加深、因此非吸食這種烈性毒品、則奄奄欲死、如若投以鴉片、則時又不能過癮、於是表面上看起來、以爲吸食鴉片的人、是减少了禁烟政策、收到了相當的效果、實際上毒禍替代烟禍的一部分、好似前門拒狼、後門却來了一虎、越來厲害了、</p>
<p>所以自民國十六年國民政府成立以來、默察環境、深知弊病所在、禁烟當然是要繼續進行、同時對於禁毒、更須貫以全力、並對於禁烟取漸進政策、期以六年、分期禁絕、對於禁毒則取念進政策、期以二年、所以自民國二十六年一月一日起、二年禁絕期滿、對於製運售吸食紅丸及一切烈性毒品的人、是一律處以死刑、</p>
<p>說到烈性毒品、究竟是些什麼東西、怎樣情形、這裏應該有個概括的說明、爲我親愛的市民吿、根據禁毒治罪條例、所謂烈性毒品、是指「嗎啡」·「高根」「海洛因」·「紅丸」·及其他化合物向言、我們也許可以聽到這句話、「這個人是打嗎啡針的、打嗎啡針就是在毒癮發作、涕淚交流的時候、用嗎啡粉化在水內、用一種有管的針、吸進這種毒水、再刺入皮膚內、把這種毒汁流到血管裏去、在這一剎那間、渾身受到麻醉、這就所謂過癮了、還有人說、「這個入在打高射砲」道所　高射砲、是用一根香烟、把牠頭上的烟絲抽掉一部分、然後把毒粉—海洛因—放在香烟頭上、用火作吸烟狀、一氣呵成、這樣毒汁、就在烟內吸入腹中、這種手續最簡便、其情狀仰首注目、極像在瞞準什麼、吸食紅丸及其他顏色的丸子、更是普遍流行在江浙一帶下流社會羣中及北方數省、這種紅丸、是用一種麵粉咖啡糖等其他物件調合而成的一顆圓粒形的東西、內中主要成仆是嗎啡高根之類、道種吸食烈性毒品、使用起來、比吸鴉片要簡單便利得多、並且容易避人耳目、不像抽鴉片的來得麻煩、可是一吸上癮、中毒就深、人就形銷骨立、非但不容易戒除、一二年之後、這種人是必死無疑的、</p>
<p>現在政府規定自民國二十六年起、凡製造或運輸毒品者、販賣或意圖販賣而持有毒品者、意岡營利、爲他人施打嗎啡、或設所供人吸用毒品者、及本人吸食各種烈性毒品者、一律處以死刑、我們若不仔細研究、以爲政府對於這種人處刑太重、應該網開一面、其實這種人吸上了毒癮之後、若不决心戒絕的括、就是政府沒有注意浚有加以處分、這種人也要在一二年內中毒而死的、所以槍斃這種人、是毫無憐惜、不値得同情的、至於這種製運販賣毒品的人、其罪更在吸毒者之上、這眞無異持刀殺人、這種人比强盜都利害兇險、所以槍斃這種人、更是應該、因此在這種塲合之下、對於政府用快刀斬亂麻的辦法、亂世用重刑的苦衷、是應該予以贊助同情、希望在殺一儆百之下、吸毒者快快戒絕、做販毒勾當者、快快放下屠刀、救人救已、</p>
<p>最後我們要說的、是一種堅確不移的事實、就是這决政府决定了這個禁烟禁毒政策之後、一直在嚴厲認眞執行、從來沒有一些假借、非達到這個六年禁絕鴉片、二年禁絕毒品不止、政府對於國民之被刑及處死、當然是一種極大損失、但是對於無志氣甘自墮落的國民，　勸不醒、只有無慈悲無辦法中去犧牲他、所以希望有覺悟的人民、不可再存觀望、徼倖之心、速速自動到醫院裏戒絕、至於製運售毒的人趕快改行、從民國二十六年，做一個自新光明自由的國民、這是何等快樂、</p>

<h3>證券　公債交易午後面漸稀</h3>
<p>昨華商證券交易所跌風仍猛、蔣委員長之蒞幷戰事必更緊張、前途非短時期可以終止、多方已多數把握不定、紛紛出籠、惟散戶頗有抵補、檯面情形、多方尙有一部拉抬、縱有回風、下降亦速、昨日經過、開槃戊種三十四號買進極湧、但僅戊丁兩種之本月份、被其抬高五分至一角半、餘則爲各帮賣氣　軍、高壓重重、卅四號各决吸收、雖甚有力、終爲六號卅五及五十三北帮等奮勇賣出而壓小、後列甲種小四角半、决盤三十四號倐已停止買進、四號十六及三十二號等賣出仍湧、進戶積極、市價再小一角至二角半、午後市氣仍虛、惟買賣已稀、散戶交易爲多、僅七十五號稍有賣出、市况續小一角半至三角、收盤散戶稍有補空、檯面臨時空頭亦有抵進、戊丁小一二角、後列好起一二角、市價結果、續跌二角半至七角半、成交總數、共計一千零十萬元、茲將其漲跌結果比較列表於後（單位元成交單位百元）</p>
<h3>紗花　實銷依然不振　棉紗續見下降　—惟買方拉力仍強—</h3>
<p>紗市晨平午跌、但趨勢尙昂、蓋以大阪三品紗市昂貴、近期紗大戶吸收甚力、兼之存紗本埠僅一萬四千包、於是買方拉力更强、惜乎現紗銷路呆頓未免美中不足也、前途情形、仍在波瀾起伏中、</p>
<p>標紗三收盤稍回振</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、本月氣勢甚昂、因大戶拖緊不放、目大阪二品紗步入高境、多方看漲、心思挺秀二盤以後、聞紗銷停頓、市面鬆懈、浮多了結、市盤回挫、結果各月比上日收盤價均跌一·二·三·四角、惟本月漲二角、午後開盤、市塲誤傳靑島紗市下跌、人心不振、散戶拋賣而挫、二盤本月猛跌三元三角、遠月亦跌一元六七角、但拍至末尾月、某棉業公司及印商努五拖進、市勢轉堅、三盤本月忽漲二元一角、遠月隨之上漲一元外、迨至收盤仍屬堅挺、據云、因三品紗價太高、投機商吸收不絕也、結果各月比上午收盤價再跌九角至一元一·五角、查賣出明德一千五百五十包、森康二千六百五十包、愼記三千六百包、大昌成二千包、生源一千六百包、同和二千五百包、晋康一千五百五十包、長餘一千二百包、望泰興一千四百五十包、潤　二千三百包、恊成一五百五十包、買進裕大一千四百包、合興一千包、賡豐六千六百包、仁豐一千七百五十包、義成一千包、長豐五千包、大昶一千三百五十包、信誠一千二包、益昶一千三白包、泰昌九百五十包、梅記八百五十包、一日間最高低市價列左、</p>

<p>內地　三〇漢口　五　天津　二〇　廣東　三〇</p>
<h3>棉市賣戶壓力甚重</h3>
<p>棉市平靜、但大衆意見看跌、賣方壓迫甚重、惟本月期市態轉昂、因新籌碼缺乏解進、且存賬數量尙巨、大孚代某方面開始補空矣、各路產區售價不肯鬆動、標準市氣恐有盤旋之局、</p>
<p>標花沂平遠疲</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、因日廠工潮復起、美棉漲跌互見、上下一至二磅音、惟印棉上升一羅比半、市氣平庸、各月跌一角半至二角、二盤價跌後賣者不旺、因鄉嚴　持甚力、市况轉趨高翔、結果各月無甚上落、惟本月漲一角、午後開盤、受紗市虛風、猛跌二三角、但近月空方活動抵補、二盤後隨紗市步步回升、結果各月比上午收盤價跌一·二角、查買出振大一千六百担、吉豐千二百擔、聚興一千六百擔、永裕二千擔、豐泰二千五百擔、義成三千五百担、益昶二千五百擔、潤康一千四百擔、生源一千九百擔、益康四千六百擔、愼肥二千五百擔、大昶一千七百　、同和一千九百　、買進大孚四千二百擔、長餘一千八百担、興昌一千七百祖、仁豐一千二百担、大昌成一千二百担、明德一千七百担、明華二千九百担、源興昌三千六百担、大慶三千四百担、賡豐二千八百担、長豐二千四百担、泰昌二千二百担、茲將一日間最高低及收盤價列左、</p>

<h3>美棉集中於十二月期了結</h3>
<p>昨美棉開盤、各月漲一至六磅音、塲內交易、集中於十二月期多頭了結、蓋本月二十四日起、將有交割通知單發表也、晨初利物浦消息良好、中部棉區之全東部、均有嚴霜、外商及同業買進、市價堅昂、旋以一部份多頭了結及棉農套賣而回、惟在上日收盤價左右、又有買進、現棉及布疋甚堅、收盤前、同業買進爲套賣所推翻、計現貨漲一磅音、期貨漲跌一二磅音、英棉現貨漲八點、期貨漲六七點、印棉歐洲出口商買進、爲多頭了結所推翻、計平果爾漲一·五至二羅比、奧姆辣及白羅溪均漲一羅比牛、原電錄左、（十七日電）</p>

<h3>糧食　麵粉實銷略有收吸</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份呈初疲繼俏之象、以洋麥報價、互有一角左右之出入、各地苦早又得微雨、故初開價人心殊見平弱、本月份會小去一分、旋以時局多故、北路戰端已難避免、致實銷略有吸動、人心亦步帶振、較初開計漲一分外、迫至下午開盤、人心又俏、較上午又好近分、惟目下各廠現貨尙豐、業中人心鎭靜、故二盤後、又轉軟弱、此種情形、仍屬盤旋、因各路購買究以市値太高、未免進退失據云、</p>
<h3>時局左右麥市</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤、各月份呈近平遠穩之象、洋麥報價、雖少上落、惟以時局問題、恐北來小麥、或受影響、因此交易雖稀、人心頗健、十二月份以下較之前日、計漲四五分不等、迨至下午開盤、本月份因空頭抵補、喊起二分、遠期曾續好　分、旋則多頭微脫、亦鬆落三四分、此後如時局步聚、暫看穩固、現麥仍然平穩、如山東五河明光特高麥開六元零五分、又至零四分半、管店張八嶺麥六元、江北麥五元九角八分、决至八角九分、漢口車麥五元九角七分、决七角五六分、由福新辦一萬一千包、申大一千包云、</p>
<h3>客秈北銷漸動</h3>
<p>昨日各路客和到頭均减、到貨祗二三千包、而北方消化漸活、如河南洛陽津浦沿路均有辦裝、機元米爲本街汕頭河南問訊、而貨主以到頭不旺、亦復扳持擯守、市面尙能站定、惟粵帮停頓、糙米略形　滯、全日開出江西各米一千〇二十包、湘米五百十八包、溫台甬各米一千五百包、行情均與前市相似云、</p>
<h3>河米天雨行市帶緊</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源、共到五十餘號、貨共萬一千五六百石、市况因天雨人心向上、本街銷塲略見轉活、且包胃客帮續辦薄稻七千餘包、及厚粳一千餘包、故形勢帶緊、結果行情薄稻加起角許不等、厚梗升一尺、杜尖更以貨稀允鮮、漲起角半、洋尖則好一角、陰變元供過於求、賴粳市、價無榮辱、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各帮來源稀少、天時陰雨、客情報緊、市上去路雖平常、新稻價加數分至一角、早稻跟緊之象、薄稻價挺立、羊埠杜尖價漲一角左右、客尖亦緊六七分、陰元貨少、價提足、變元到銷兩和、其餘各米均帶緊勢、</p>

<p>黑棗產價、歷久不鬆、故此間所到客貨、照市均需虧本、現在北鄉棗頭開三十一二元、頭高莊二十五六元、二高莊二十一二元至十八九元、尖統手十六七元、統手　四五元、二棗十三元至十二元半、南鄉棗頭十九元、高莊十五六元、統手十二三元、二棗十二元、成交千除包、</p>
<p>糯米枝、近銷轉稀、號盤略鬆、昨聞壜莊高貨號盤前開過一百二十元者、近開一百十二元、比小八元、普通照减、</p>
<h3>百合片粵幫有需要</h3>
<p>百合片自出新以來、現在銷路漸見活動、查市價最低時會到十三元、昨市已到十八元、前後步升四五元之多、趨勢穩定、一時未易回鬆、蓋粵幫時有需要故耳、</p>

<h3>絲茶絲經昨有相當成交</h3>
<p>昨日海外絲市、日美均稍回漲、（紐約近期漲一分、橫濱遠期漲九元、）市氣已較生動、中市人心似有看跌拋售之趨勢、故昨日絲銷較形活絡、白廠經B字七八勻度及八〇勻度有成批交易、然行盤於　相較　巳回小二十元許、永興速納等行、均有相當吸收、共成交四〇〇包、其他絲品四十四包、用戶走銷仍無特色、惟價格尙見平穩、昨日本埠織廠共進四十五包、亦僅堪點綴耳</p>
<h3>五金　大馬口鐵定出三百箱</h3>
<p>三十寸三十六寸大馬口鐵、市上現貨已感不多、故同業多向海外續訂、查昨日定出三百箱、價二十四號每箱七十先令、二十六號每箱五十九先令、聞均由百老匯路一帶同業定進、至申市行情、如二十四號每箱售九十元、二十六號售七十八元、均比先前好起一二元不等、交易紗廠家採辦甚踴躍、而玩具廠聞亦有點綴云、</p>
<h3>厚馬口鐵銷路暢旺</h3>
<p>厚馬口鐵前昨以來、市塲採辦者甚爲暢盛故市勢非常良好、行情比前提加數分、如二十二號每磅沽四角、二十四號沽三角五、二十六號沽二角二十七號以下均沽二角四分、查客戶採辦、以二十二及二十四號爲最多、而二十六號化色、聞亦開出不少、惟市存頗爲單薄云、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>帶着眼淚的微笑</h3>
<p>— 史楫</p>
<p>—如何援绥—</p>
<p>從這幾天來的事實我們可以知道，綏遠前綫的忠勇的戰士們，他們是如何的負擔起了光榮神聖的責任！也在這幾天之中我們可以看到，全國各地的民衆們，是已怎樣的負起了慰勞捐欵的義務。</p>
<p>從這一事實中，我們可以看得出來，爲了祖國的存亡，民衆們是已怎樣的和前錢忠勇的戰士們連繫在一起了！我們往往聽到有人說我們的民氣消沉，我們也往往聽到有人說我們的將士們是怯敵的，但在這幾天用事實來答覆的又是什慶呢？</p>
<p>我們又看到了黑龍江抗戰，一二八之變，古北口殺敵時的慷慨赴難的将士和踴躍輸將的民衆了。從這一點我們可以確信：祇要是為了保衛祖國而戰，不僅是將士用命，已衆們是更會「萬山響應，舉國風從」的來擁護為祖國而戰的戰士們的。</p>
<p>現在，這個「光榮之遭遇」正落在綏遠的忠勇的戰士們身上。而綏遠的戰士們也並沒有辜負這個「光榮之遭遇」，這兩天的戰跡固然是最好的擔保，而另外，我們再來看罷：閣錫山將軍奉母命捐遺產八十七萬元，傳作義將軍在平地泉「聲淚俱下」的對他忠勇的部下說：「此乃光榮之遭遇！畏怯必死，逃避必死，惟勇敢者不死，願以必死之心抗戰來侵敵人者亦不死！」李服膺將軍爲了「鼓勵士兵誓死抗戰起見，特將其家屬自歸綏遷來陶林」。從上述的許多事實中，當我們讀到了這樣的新聞時，我們是禁不住會流出感激興奮的眼淚來的。</p>
<p>但是，綏遠的戰爭並不是綏遠一省的戰爭，從過去幾决的「前車之鑒」，我們也知道孤軍苦戰的結果必陷於失敗，保衛國土旣是軍人的天職，我們就應該「不分地域」的發動全國的軍隊來援綏！要知道唇亡則齒寒，我們這决是救亡，並不是敎塲上比武，要等到一個失了一個再上去。卽使要論功行賞，也須看在整個救亡運動中的功續如何而定的！</p>
<p>其次，我們在報上時常看到敵機的來我陣地偵察和投彈，由於將士的奮勇，我們在今天報上雖然看到擊落敵機一架的新聞，但是近年來我們民衆不是也捐了許多飛機給政府嗎，我們的飛機在那裏呢？</p>
<p>至於民衆捐欵給前敵將士，那自然是必要的，但是前敵將士們所更需要的却不是錢而是醫藥用品，防毒面具和棉衣！前錢這幾天已在降雪了，將士們的軍衣却相當的單薄；在前幾天的報上我們知道敵軍運到了好多車毒瓦斯彈，現在雖然還未施放，但技窮的時侯他們是會施放的，在這個時候，防毒面具便比什麽都重要！</p>
<p>我們的捐助旣是爲了要忠勇的將死們誓士守土，那麽爲什麽不捐助些於戰士們更有直接利益的防毒面具，棉衣，和醫藥用具及共他物品呢？</p>
<p>並不是以小人之心度君子之腹，爲了防止害羣之馬的中飽起見，也是以直接捐助物品給前綫將士此較來得適當，自然，爲了防患未遂起見，最好是購買好了自已認爲前錢最需要的物品再行送去，這樣就連中間人的回佣也可以省去了。</p>
<p>而在目前，省去一分浪費，便是增厚一分國防的力量。</p>

<h3>資格</h3>
<p>— 方潔</p>
<p>近來的人批判人家的好壞，常喜以資格爲限：雖然這方法是有點呆板不通，但仍爲人所樂用。譬如，照例先由甲發問：「喂，×××是什麽出身呀」？乙答：「是××學堂哩」！於是丙就繼之以「嗡嗡嗡………」好像經過這樣一番三段演繹論後，就决不會再有什麽遺憾了·至於結果，當然已在丙的「嗡嗡嗡：……」之中、得到了微妙的悟解。</p>
<p>考資格之由來，中國是大槪由於唐時才被興起的；唐以前，選腎舉能的責任，都唯二千石是務，漢文帝的「求茂材異等詔」，也著重於二千石的推荐。任方面的官吏，都要悉心訪求，看看境內有沒有什麽孝廉方正足資楷模的人可以報聞。而士君子之流，也羣以辟徵爲榮。</p>
<p>但一到唐太宗開科取士後，就另替仕人闢了一條騰達的捷徑，貧苦之士，不斷坐玷穿硯，祗要一旦金榜題名，就什麽也不用憂慮了；反之，任你博學淵源，精通古今，也難出人頭地！唐書：</p>
<p>「羅隱文名滿天下。有番使入朝，歸後其主問之曰：識得江東羅昭諫吾？曰：禾識得。主怒·何未識得？曰：榜上無名」。（大意如此原文不盡詳）</p>
<p>羅隱已經文名滿天下了，但因缺少了一重榜上的資格，終爲番使所輕，可見此時的資格，就已具威勢。</p>
<p>此後沿傳至淸，此風更盛，甚至著爲令典，凡非科甲出身的，一律不准入閣—就更替有資格人撑了腰。</p>
<p>現在科舉雖已廢止，但進身之具，仍非資格莫辦。——有特殊情節當然不在此例——有許多本非志在求學的：但爲獵取功名起見，也不得不到海外去走一這，等到鍍金歸來，雖然腹內生銹，也依然氣勢十足！</p>
<p>求官如此，戀愛何嘗不如此：小學嫁中學，中學嫁大學，大學嫁留學：到留學無可再嫁了，於是嫁部長一總　　節節高！</p>
<p>沒資格的人，休說做事，便連女人也不易對付！</p>
<h3>薄暮街景</h3>
<p>— 陸嘉</p>
<p>聊城路，臨淸路，淸平路，三條平行的從東洋移殖來的街路。</p>
<p>到處有小巧的日本風的西洋建築，水門汀的人行道上咯咯響着的木屐，彎着腰的老婦人的頻繁的深鞠躬和謙和的「莎楊娜拉」。在這裏做晚步的人簡直有點疑惑自己的國籍和所踐踏的土地了。</p>
<p>淺淡的黃昏，薄霧迷濛了稍遠的街燈。慶平堂高級舞踏塲的樸素的日本音樂，和低徊的姣好的語音隨着年紅燈的光暈彌散開來。小巧精緻的舞屋建築有怪新頴的外形：塗佈着銀粉的墻壁，弧形的鋼窗，配合了嬌美的顯色的店招。覺得是只能繪在紙上讓人讚賞的建築圖案却眞地能移殖到地面上了。門口列一串素雅的燈影和街車的淡墨影。</p>
<p>一面憶着讚美的心情漫步於藍白條紋的遮陽下的人行道上。咖啡座，菓子鋪，舞場各以嶄新的姿態出現在各種不同的調和的光色下。人們賣弄似地用各種材料建築一個個的店屋，甚至有的用計門窗。</p>
<p>鋪道上，散佈着日本店鋪的特有的氣味，女人們的粉香，花鋪課開着的雜色的花香。</p>
<p>店窗課陳列着繽紛的小雅的雜物，以其新奇與精巧吸引許多瀏覽者。於是　木拉門頻時的滑動，一些木展踏進舖着席子的店屋，而隨着謙恭的鞠躬和多謝帶着大包小包被送出來，安置在黃昏的舖道上　重新做一個店窗的欣賞與拜訪。</p>
<p>身前身後的全是有同種的　色而　有相同的國籍的人，短小的身材套着寬大的西裝。女人們梳了高聳的髮髻；帶着遮陽傘，雖則沒有撑起：一層白厚的粉敷滿面龐，頸項和露出的前胸。邁看　　的步子從身邊擦過，寬長的袖口曳起一陣腥味的香。</p>
<p>沿着兩排整齊的街樹轉進淸平路，在樹影裏隱的地露出紅的綠的紙燈籠來。每一間門口有日本料理和朝鮮御料理的牌招。不很寬闊的街，街心，舖着幽暗的月光：人行道上，鋪着紙燈籠的光與懸着桃紅帳帘的窗口逸出的燈光。在各個門口幽雅的光影下有幾個敷着鮮艷的粉脂色的女人們，用淫佚的眼波捕捉街道上獵奇樣四面搜索的人的眼波。一陣低級的調笑鬨然地揚起來，女人們放肆地笑了，而男子則面紅着溜到橫街上去。</p>
<p>朝鮮人，日本人各自佔據各人的門首，互相用鄙視的眼光窺探。那忘卻了亡國的悲哀的女子多穿着素綢的衫子，胸前裸露着來眩耀被自己出賣的肉體：那征服人家的國家的女兒卻沒有祖國的光榮，空有着在髮卷的髻子下姣好的顏面；輕巧的嘴唇；島國的珍珠似的澄淸的眼珠子：每晚佇立在門口等仙每夜的新郎。</p>
<p>可是在路角的僻靜的街燈下，冷落的一盞淡藍的素娟燈籠，有穿稱身素雅的西裝的女兒，獨自個兒倚着門框坐在石階上描繪着俊美的風姿，於沒有入來注意她，空自默默地坐着，坐着。</p>
<p>明明在自己的國度裏，踐着自己的國土，在這裏卻有在海外做僑客的感覺，我不禁低下頭吐出黯然的太息了。（靑島素描之一）</p>
<h3>挨駡</h3>
<p>— 丁尼</p>
<p>小白眼不停手的紮完了聚寶盆的壳子，覺得胳膊有點酸痛。揀了一隻漿糊少些的手指擦一擦睡眠五小時的眼睛，看淸楚沒有黃頭毛的影踪在店堂里。「是休息的時候了」的想念命令他的手停止工作。麻得鐵一樣硬的脚跨上了高凳，似乎感到些舒適。錶袋里的烟蒂又含在嘴角邊了。</p>
<p>黃頭毛一脚跨進店堂，小白眼想把烟蒂的火捏熄已來不及了。</p>
<p>立刻，小白眼的祖宗在黃頭毛並不很厚的嘴唇里像唸經那樣的被咒駡着了</p>
<p>「天下沒有像你這樣懶，生活做得這樣慢的東西！」</p>
<p>「可是我祗有二隻手啊」！他這樣想，却沒說出口來。</p>
<p>要是在三年前，小白眼早已跳起來對罵了：「老子有的是氣力，不吃你的飯難道會餓死不成。」</p>
<p>像小白眼這副本領，三年前的確誰都搶着要的。可是，近年來却不同了。有一次，他負氣把舖蓋從一家紙紮店搬出來時，險乎餓死在小客棧里。</p>
<p>「有氣力，未必就能換飯吃啊」！</p>
<p>他懂得這一點，對黃頭毛的咒駡，就跟耳邊風似的，全不放在心里。</p>
<p>黃頭毛駡了一陣，看看小白眼儘管低下頭糊紙！也就覺得駡得沒有對勁的地坐下來。</p>
<p>也许是黃頭毛的駡聲太響亮了，驚動了樓上的房東太太，　很吃力的把她的一百八十磅的身體從一樓上搬下來。開口第一句就是：</p>
<p>「黃老闆，房錢呢？</p>
<p>「對不起得很，跑了半天，還是借不到，祇好”你寬限幾天……」黃頭毛滿臉的笑容。</p>
<p>「欠了三個月房錢，的到今天還是沒有，這怎麼成呢？我上面也要付房錢的啊！」冷冷地。</p>
<p>「實在因爲店里生意不好……」</p>
<p>「生意不好管我什麽事，開不起店做什麽老闆呢？」說着，氣唬的又把她的一百八十磅的身體吃力地搬到樓上</p>
<p>黃頭毛沒有說什麽，在橙子發一回呆。又跳起來：</p>
<p>「都是你這猪玀，笨坯。你一來，店就弄得……」</p>
<p>小白眼挨着駡，一聲不響，儘管低下頭糊紙。他知道爲什麼要被駡，他從每天被駡中得到解答了。挨罵一天，活一天啊！</p>
<h3>故鄉的眷戀</h3>
<p>— 藍佩</p>
<p>船尾巴轟隆轟隆地翻起乳白色的浪花，藍海上淡白色色那條紋越長，船離開爪哇越遠了！</p>
<p>故鄕的眷戀輕輕地蒙上心頭。</p>
<p>故鄕，對於我是有着詩的情意的。</p>
<p>我愛那兒的藍天，我愛那兒擺着葉浪的遼廣的蔗田，我愛那兒瘦直的椰子樹在藍天下，在淸風裏，在月光中噓噓吹起醉人的曲子。</p>
<p>海邊，軟軟的沙灘。輕輕放上脚去，留下了淸晰的印痕。</p>
<p>當你把貝壳檢滿半袋，累了一一爬到大樹幹上，平放開四肢，望着遠處，那水天一色的地方，幾點白帆隔開了藍天和碧海。風柔柔也吹着。你一一倦了，甚至於：睡了。</p>
<p>在那兒：早晨和黃昏帶給你迷蕩的陶醉！</p>
<p>黑夜一一溫情的恬靜！</p>
<p>留神吧！馬來女人黑瞳裏你看出了什麽？溫柔？含情脈脈？</p>
<p>樸實土氣的馬來土人呢？那原始的坦白之心呵！</p>
<p>在故鄉：一切是一一畫面，屠格涅夫的散文詩。</p>
<p>我伏在船尾欄干上。心，跟着那長長地遙遠地伸張到故鄕去的船行過的痕一路回到故鄉去了！</p>

<h3>老余底兒子</h3>
<p>— 費向東</p>
<p>那是在海元輸船上，我遇見了一個年紀五十多歲的，瘦弱的老人。我們倦伏在悶臭的統艙中，佔着不到一丈寬的位置，整天地在一起，挨着無盡長的日子。因爲長日的無聊：我們開始談起話來，在通問到姓名上去的時候，他吸着馬占山牌香烟，這樣地介紹了自己。</p>
<p>「我呌余錦福——但是在新加坡，人家總是呌我老余。在新加坡我住了二十年，起先是做鞋匠，後來積了一點小錢，便自己開起鞋店來了。我僅有一個兒子，是死去了十多年的妻生的；這兒子是我一生底命脈——他現在在上海××大學里唸書，快要畢業了。」</p>
<p>「那末，你到上海去是看你底兒子去的吧？」我打挿了一句。</p>
<p>「是呀！我們也足有三年不見面了。」他吐着灰色的烟霧，兩道澀滯的眼光望着它漸漸淡下去而想起了什麽似地，突然沉默下去了。</p>
<p>統艙裏鬧雜得很利害：人們在艙裏走來走去，有時是那些粗壯的水手們不知道爲什麽在吆喝着旅客。別的一些人在聚着打撲克，他們底聲音嘈嘈得可怕；不遠的那邊，帶了兩個小孩的那胖婦入，不曉得怎麽沒有侍候到那小的一個，哇哇地又大哭起來。</p>
<p>瞧不見天和地，從圓窗孔裏望出去，是一片渺茫的海水，單調得要敎發瘋。</p>
<p>我不相信余錦福可以若無其事地在這裏打發他底日和夜。有的時候他靜靜地躺在他那簡單的行李旁邊，對着黃色的電燈，吸着馬占山香烟的時侯，老是想着什麽似地，對着自己嘴裏噴出來的烟霧出神；有的時候他就非常高興地吿訴我關於他底兒子底一切，和對於他底期望。這老人是爲了有一個兒子才活下來的——而且活得那麽興奮！</p>
<p>「想想吧，我底兒子再也不是一個鞋匠了！」他說着這句話，眉毛揚起來，「靠兩隻手吃飯是一伴痛苦的事：我自己嘗够了。現在只要小福成人立志，我不是可以享幾年福了嗎？」</p>
<p>「是的——」我應了一聲，心裏本替他着急，因爲他把他底兒子估價得太高了。</p>
<p>余錦福在我底面前誇示着他底兒子，一直到了上海底招商局碼頭，我們各自準備上岸的時候，他還是口不離他的小福。</p>
<p>「咦！奇怪，小福爲什麽不來等船呢？」</p>
<p>「你寫過信給他的嗎？」</p>
<p>「當然囉！寫得明白白的，難道他——」</p>
<p>「也許功課忙，走不開……我們先找一個地方住下再說吧。」</p>
<p>碼頭上熙熙攘攘地，旅館掮客用各種聲調打從我們底面前走過，招徠着旅客。余錦福好像不相信他底兒子會不來似地，不讓他底行李給那些掮客們動一下，睜大了兩眼往碼頭那邊望。</p>
<p>可是終於是沒有來！這使老余異常失望，漸漸變成了沮喪。我呢，這時却要和他分手了，我已經把行李交給了旅館底掮客。在人聲嘈雜中，我和他握了手，道了一聲再會便走了。</p>
<p>大的過了一個月以後，我在一條不很熱鬧的街上過見了這海元輪上的旅伴余錦福；他顯得很消瘦，而且精神也很萎頓。我問道：「找到了你底兒子吧？」出乎意外地他向我搖頭，吿訴我余小福在他來到前兩個月，有一天的夜裏，突然在宿舍裏被拉走了！一直到現在，他得不到一點消息，……</p>

<p>曲曲欄杆曲曲牆。灣灣曲曲繞迴廊。行行去去穿芳徑。一陣陣風來一陣香。蝶翩翩。燕雙雙。枝枝葉葉影垂楊。但見那桃花灼灼明如錦。柳絮飄飄欲舞狂。又聽那，鐵馬鏘鏘風動響。鶯啼嚦嚦鼓　簧。簾鈎未見重重捲。裊裊爐薰韓壽香。想奴奴，鎭”昏昏縈舊恨。倦迷迷懶去繡鴛鴦。玉梳不理絲絲髮。寶鐘慵施淡淡妝。終日裏，獨坐蘭房聲寂寂？惹起了，慷懨臥病在牙牀。便喚那，爐中添撥熊熊火。侍婢忙忙煎藥湯。但聽得，風雨賽凄窗外打。狐燈黯黯夜愁長。不由他，心中是是非非想。私語喃喃暗自量。曾記得，我我卿卿前有的。只望那朝朝暮暮伴蕭郎。竟不料，茫茫　海風波起。害得奴，孤影單單空守房。我是寸寸迥腸寸寸斷。相思不見淚洋洋。從今後，路迢迢盼不到音信寄。血淚斑斑哭斷腸。正覺得，苦雨濛濛悲寂寞。愁屬瑟瑟成凄凉。只剩那，燈殘點點拋紅豆。悄悄羅幃淡無光。可憐我，自恨悠悠傷命薄。淚在在濕透綺羅裳。試看那，庭前靑草年年綠。只恨得，縷縷情　繫不長。夢魂渺渺熱黃粱。</p>

<p>「四十年代」的「賽金花」，今晚在金城大戲院獻演</p>
<h3>從「桃李刦」到「生死同心」　記陳波兒</h3>
<p>她是一位生長在南國的女性，在中國戲劇界是有着相常歷史的。提起她好似在印象中浮起了一種聖潔的新恣態，和一般時行的女明星是有着迴然的不同。</p>
<p>以前她是中國公學的學生，思想和學識都是非常進步的，是中國影壇上罕有的一位藝人。</p>
<p>「桃李刦」的名震遐邇，是她在銀壇上第一次的成就，至今在我們的腦膜上還遺留着不泯的痕跡：這次明星二廠新陳營「生死同心」之攝製，是他們導演以至演員的第二次合作。</p>
<p>在「桃李刦」，波兒是一個柔弱的女性，折磨而終于犧牲在這個萬惡的環境之下，細柔的演技曾博得許多觀衆之同悄之淚，在最近攝製完竣的「生死同死」裏，她是飾演了一個性格完全不同的女性，雖然溫文和感情還是她內在的性格，但在這戲裏，這種性格變成了另外一種東西，感情沒有把她陷入于一般戀愛的泥沼裏，而由于對這社會之更淸楚的認識上，轉變成了人類更偉大的愛，她忘却了失去愛人的苦痛和傷感，努力于更有意義的事業之爭鬥。這是一個新的女性之典型，是値得整千萬徬徨在十字街頭的婦女們注意的。</p>
<p>從「桃李刦」到「生死同心」已隔了兩年多，中國婦女的地位變革得怎樣了，中國的婦女們又進步得怎樣了？</p>
<h3>「生死同心」雜寫</h3>
<p>它是一部名貴的歷史作品，但是並沒有一個歷史上人物的名字，但這是更可貴的，因爲它超越了普通一部電影作品的藝術價値，它反映了某種的社會動態，反映了某個時代的狂颷，它是有着這樣一種更高的社會價値。</p>
<p>看，這是靑年男女生活的又一面，監獄，整千萬人從這裏釋放出來又從這裏進去，悠畏的歲月是同他們寶貴的靑春一樣的被毀滅了。這是什麽，聰明的觀衆，你們自己理會吧，</p>
<p>我們曾經看過了「亡命者」，我們曾看過「牢獄兩萬年」，某個時代下的法律，秩序，中外都是一樣的，這部「生死同心」，它便是刻劃出了一個在軍閥治下所常發生的故事。</p>
<p>幾個監獄塲面之處理，應雲衛導演得頗有「亡命者」中之作風，是中國影片中所罕見的。</p>
<h3>「壯志凌雲」</h3>
<p>一部充滿粗獷氣息的戲</p>
<p>吳永剛編導的悲壯熱烈鉅片「壯志凌雲」，主演人員是金燄干人美夫婦’他倆雖然各都在中國影壇上負有極高的聲譽，在一起合作，這還是第一次，當然，以他們過去的造就，再加「壯志凌雲」本來是一部充滿組獷氣息奮鬥精神的戲，預料一定有驚人的貢獻。同時，新華當局爲了使這部戲十全十美，也决定以極大的資財去攝製，上决大隊人馬西開鄭州外景的盛舉，就是一個明證。</p>

<h3>The Bandit Army Border Disturbance Yesterday Launched a Surprise Attack on Yuhe: Tuchengzi Nanhao Is Under Severe Pressure, Taolin Also Suffered a Fierce Attack; Our Army at Honggeertu Reinforced the Defenses Sufficiently; The Bandit Army Has Completed Preparations and Is Determined to Launch a Large-Scale Offensive Today or Tomorrow, Aiming to Expand the Battle Lines with Wuchuan and Guyang as Goals</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Jining Telegraph: The Mongol puppet army has completed its preparations, gathering more than 20,000 infantry, cavalry, and artillery mixed troops in Shangdu Bailingmiao, with Wang Jingxiu, Zhuoshishai, and Li Shouxin taking command. On the 19th and 20th, a general offensive will be launched with Wuchuan, Taolin, and Guyang as goals, and the battle line will extend to western and northern Sui. A large number of armored vehicles from the puppet army were transported to Bailingmiao on the 18th, and our army is also increasing troops in that direction. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Jining Telegraph: More than 2,000 puppet troops under the command of Li Shouxin and Wang Ying, starting at 8:00 AM on the 18th, abandoned the offensive line at Honggeertu and strategically changed their direction to a surprise attack on Yuhe. Skirmishes have already occurred at Tuchengzi Nanhao trench. Also, on the Taolin front, our defense line was fiercely attacked at dawn on the 18th by more than 1,000 superior puppet cavalry mixed troops, with several bombers dropping bombs in the air and machine-gunning. We are cooperating to resist. Cannon fire was heard inside Taolin and Xinghe cities. On the 18th, our army shot down a bandit plane on the Honggeertu front. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Jining Telegraph: Xinghe Nanhao trench and Tuchengzi are under severe pressure. Our reinforcements arrived at Honggeertu on the 18th. Before departing, Zhao Chengshou gave a speech, saying that this time to open the front line to suppress bandits is related to the honor of the nation and the reputation of our army. We should strive to be diligent, endure hardship and cold, kill the enemy and achieve results, to face the ancestors under the ground for four thousand years and future generations. We are not fighting for Chairman Fu and me personally, but for defending the land. The soldiers were moved and cheered upon hearing this. Also, when the battle was launched on the 13th, the enemy's strength was ten times greater, and they pounced many times, but our army calmly repelled them. After the 17th, the front defense became more solid, and the strength of our left and right wings has been fully replenished. Even if the puppet army comes to attack, it will be difficult to succeed. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Zhangjiakou) The battle of Suidong Geertu was slightly soothed on the afternoon of the 17th, but the planes hovered over the Sui army's position from time to time. The battle situation turned fierce on the morning of the 18th. Eight planes bombed and disturbed the rear of the Sui army's position. The bandit's staff officer arrived in Shangdu from Dolun on the evening of the 17th and went to the front to inspect on the morning of the 18th. Wang Ying, Li Shouxin, and Yin Baoshan accompanied him to direct the battle. Also, more than 3,000 troops of Zhang Junzhe's unit of the bandits' army stationed in Dolun and Rehe are also advancing westward. According to reliable information, 6,000 Mongol troops, after Zhuoshishai's 1,000 troops arrive in northern Sui from the cattle and sheep herds, are determined to launch a fierce attack on the Sui army at Wuchuan Wugongba within this month. Also, the transported poisonous gas is now stored in the Shen family's house in Shangdu City, guarded by many people, waiting to be used when the time comes. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) Northern Sui is gradually becoming tense, but there was no change on the 18th. In addition to continuing to besiege Honggeertu, the bandit army in eastern Sui also began to invade the border of Xinghe with a small number of miscellaneous puppet troops on the 18th. The US Consul General in Tianjin, Mr. Hureid, went to Pingdiquan from Sui on the 18th to visit Fu Zuoyi and investigate the actual situation in eastern Sui. Zeng Yiyi returned to Sui on the 18th to deploy defenses in northern Sui. More people from home and abroad sent telegrams of encouragement to Zuoyi and remittances of aid on the 18th. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) More and more bandits are invading Honggeertu. Judging from the current situation, the bandits' intention is nothing more than to cover Wang's bandits' northward advance and disrupt our strategic plans. There were fierce battles in Honggeertu on the night of the 16th and the morning of the 17th. Bandit planes dropped incendiary bombs, and many houses in the area were burned. It is reported that Zuoyi is temporarily stationed in Kou area to plan. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Relevant parties received news from the front that the battle of Honggeertu was once quiet on the 17th, and there were again outpost battles on the morning of the 18th. It is reported that Zuoyi inspected the defenses in various places and expressed great satisfaction with the deployment. Zhao Chengshou also sent a telegram to Beijing on the 18th. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Two hundred and twenty farmers from Jiabusi in Shandong Province, due to the outbreak of war, could not make a living, and returned to their hometown together. They passed through Tianjin on the 18th to go to Shandong. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Bandit's Troops are Advancing Step by Step</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The puppet bandit troops of Li Shouxin, Jin Jiasan, and Wang Ying in Taolin have been attacking Honggeertu fiercely for days, but have not succeeded and suffered heavy losses. Seeing that the operations were unfavorable, the bandit side has actively increased the dispatch of a large number of troops. Troops from Dage, Weichang, Dolun, and Baochang are now advancing step by step and concentrating in Shangdu. There will be a main battle in the coming days. Contact occurred at the front from time to time yesterday and today. Our army's defenses are solid, and morale is high. It is reported that Zuoyi is still staying to supervise the battle command. The city of Peiping and various circles have sent representatives to Sui to comfort the soldiers. Students from various schools in Suiyuan are responsible for various national salvation tasks to protect their homeland. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The puppet army of Zhang Haipeng and others now in Dolun, Rehe, and part of the army are moving to Shangdu to concentrate. Bao Yueqing, now in Bailingmiao, previously sent a representative to Shangdu to negotiate with the puppet bandit leader Li Shouxin and others. It is heard that the Mongol cavalry of the Bao unit will invade northern Sui, and there is also a saying that a large-scale offensive will be launched in two or three days. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Telegram to Beijing Claims Difficulties with Supplies</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Since the bandit disturbance in eastern Sui, Fu Zuoyi and Yan Xishan have been sending telegrams to Beijing every day. The telegram reported that the income of Sui Province is limited and supplies are difficult. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Report of Cash Discovered for Rewarding Soldiers</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Jining Telegraph: At 6:00 PM on the 17th, more than 300 puppet infantry and more than 100 cavalry were discovered in Dongjia Village near Xinghe Tuchengzi, and a field battle occurred with our security team. Our garrison at Nanhao trench rushed to support and ambushed the bandits. The bandits retreated in a panic. Bandit tracks were discovered in Yangpo Village No. 4 Village on the night of the 17th, but the number of people is unknown. Fu Zuoyi specially discovered cash to reward our soldiers for their calm suppression of the bandits, and the morale of the army has been greatly boosted. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Sui Army Fully Demonstrates its Capabilities</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Jining Discussion: The puppet troops attacking Taolin are rushing to build cloud ladders in Shangdu in an attempt to seize our important bunkers and cut off our communication. According to a certain commander, in the Sui border battles in recent days, the Sui army has fully demonstrated its ability to endure and defend. It is reported that the soldiers under him are diligent. The eastern Sui is a plain, and the trenches are built on the desert. Although the drop points of bombs and heavy artillery shells are very good, the explosive force has been reduced. Airplanes and field artillery have lost their power. Most of the bandit troops are cavalry, and our army can disperse the dense bandit teams. The bandit cavalry will rush to attack all day long, and they will also run away when approaching the trenches. However, the great battle is scheduled for tomorrow or the day after. If there is no problem with the puppet's general attack on Wuchuan Guyang, then the bandit's strength will be exhausted. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) When the official spokesperson of the Japanese Foreign Ministry clarified the Japanese government's position on the Suiyuan war today, it completely denied that the Japanese government bore any responsibility for the Mongol army's invasion of Sui. The spokesperson said that the war in eastern Sui was purely a domestic incident in China and had nothing to do with Japan. Even if Japanese nationals participated in the Mongol army's operations, it should be regarded as personal actions and had nothing to do with the Japanese government and the Japanese army. The spokesperson also solemnly cited several examples of foreigners participating in domestic disputes in other countries in history and directly admitted that the Japanese government expressed sympathy for any defensive actions taken by Inner Mongolia against communism. The spokesperson finally responsibly stated that the Japanese government had absolutely no involvement in the Suiyuan war and said that China had no reason to interfere in how it attacked invaders within its own territory, because the ability to defend against enemies was a basic requirement for every country. Also, various newspapers here published the opinions of the Kwantung Army, claiming that Japan absolutely sympathized with the Inner Mongolian army led by De Wang's invasion of Shanxi and Sui and sincerely wished them success. However, the Kwantung Army denied knowing about the Mongol army's actions in advance. (18th Central News Agency Telegraph)</p>

<h3>The German-Japanese Alliance and the Far Eastern Political Situation</h3>
<p>— Lang</p>
<p>News of a German-Japanese alliance has been circulating for some time. A few days ago, Patterson, a reporter from the Baltimore Sun, arrived in Shanghai from Japan and released a shocking piece of news, saying that Germany and Japan had signed an alliance treaty two weeks ago to jointly counter the Soviet Union. Patterson cited many facts to prove that Germany and Japan had indeed signed an alliance treaty, and that Prime Minister Hirota and Foreign Minister Arita would soon submit it to the Privy Council. It is expected that a statement will be issued before the opening of the Diet around November 24. Although Germany and Japan have both denied Patterson's statements, the Italian newspaper Giornale d'Italia, a semi-official publication of the Italian government, also published a report saying that the German-Japanese alliance had been established and that Japan had joined the anti-Soviet common front. Judging from the news from various sources, the conclusion of the German alliance treaty has been about 70 to 80 percent confirmed.</p>
<p>Let us temporarily set aside the question of whether the German-Japanese alliance treaty has been formally concluded and discuss the possibility of Germany and Japan establishing an alliance. Anyone who is even slightly aware of the development of the international situation in recent years knows that there is a very high possibility that Germany and Japan will establish an alliance treaty. This very high possibility exists in the two countries' common stance against the Soviet Union. We have heard a great deal about Germany's anti-Soviet policy from the speeches of Hitler and Goebbels, key figures of the Nazi Party. The Nazi Party Congress held in Nuremberg not long ago was a crusade against the Soviet Union. The main reasons why Germany is so actively carrying out the anti-Soviet movement are, on the one hand, because communism is the sworn enemy of Nazism, and on the other hand, it wants to win the sympathy of other imperialist countries for Germany's military expansion plan through its anti-Soviet policy. Germany not only actively carries out the anti-Soviet movement itself, but also unites European countries with similar interests to form an international anti-Soviet crusade. The outcome of the Italian-German talks in late October has led Italy to restart its anti-Soviet work. Austria, Hungary, and other countries have also joined the anti-Soviet common front after the recent Vienna Conference.</p>
<p>However, if the anti-Soviet crusade only attacks the Soviet Union from Eastern Europe, it will not easily deliver a fatal blow to the Soviet Union. Therefore, they have to unite with Japan in the Far East to jointly attack the Soviet Union. Just like Germany, Japan has long adopted an anti-Soviet policy, positioning itself as the vanguard of anti-communism in the East, in order to consolidate the position of its ruling class and to cover up its military operations to invade China. On this common stance against the Soviet Union, these two major fascist countries in the East and West will naturally have a very high possibility of joining hands. As soon as the time is ripe, they can attack the Soviet Union from both the East and West.</p>
<p>If the German-Japanese alliance is established, it will naturally be a major blow to world peace. Because regardless of the ideology adopted by the Soviet Union, its efforts for international peace in recent years have been obvious to all. The establishment of the German-Japanese alliance not only seriously threatens world peace, but also has a great impact on our country due to geographical relations. In recent years, the Japanese imperialists have invaded China and occupied the territories of the Northeast, always proclaiming to the outside world that their actions are to prevent the development of Soviet influence, thereby winning the sympathy of Western European countries. Now, if the anti-Soviet German-Japanese alliance is concluded, then Japan can further invade our territory to prepare for anti-Soviet activities. Tokyo's pressure on us to conclude an anti-communist agreement is also to drive us to become their victims in countering the Soviet Union. Recently, the United Mongol Army's attack on Suiyuan, on the one hand, is to expand the power of its master behind the scenes and seize our last line of national defense. On the other hand, it also wants to occupy Suiyuan as a base for attacking the Soviet Union in the future. Therefore, after the establishment of the German-Japanese alliance, the invasion of China by Japanese imperialists will inevitably go a step further.</p>
<h3>Japanese and German Negotiations - Conclusion of Anti-Russian Alliance - Military Secret Agreement Reportedly Initialed - Russia Consolidates Defenses on Eastern and Western Borders</h3>
<p>(Moscow) According to a reliable report released by the Soviet Russian official news agency TASS, the Soviet Russian ambassador to Tokyo learned from Japanese Foreign Minister Arita yesterday that negotiations between Japan and a certain powerful nation to form an alliance against communism are currently underway. However, Arita denied concluding any agreement targeting Soviet Russia. At the same time, the Japanese Foreign Minister stated that Japan is currently striving to establish close and more friendly relations with Soviet Russia, and that negotiations between Japan and a third country have no direct or indirect impact on Japanese-Russian relations. TASS also stated that, according to the same reliable source, the so-called third country is undoubtedly Germany, and that an agreement to deal with Soviet Russia has already had the first signature affixed in Tokyo. The content of the agreement, superficially aimed at mutual anti-communism, is actually a smokescreen for another secret treaty between Japan and Germany. This secret agreement stipulates that if one or both of the signatory countries enter into war with a third country, they will take consistent action. Moscow did not express surprise upon receiving the above information, as Soviet Russia has deeply believed in the existence of such an understanding between Japan and Germany since Hitler came to power. In his official report to the Central Executive Committee last year, Soviet People's Committee Chairman Molotov mentioned the existence of an agreement between Japan and Germany. Based on this rumor, the Soviet government, fearing simultaneous attacks on its eastern and western borders, established a large-scale army and naval base in the Ural Mountains to prevent the Red Army's forces from being constrained.

<h3>British Foreign Secretary Meets with Japanese Envoy - Inquires About Truth of Japanese-German Agreement - Negative Impression in London Political Circles</h3>
<p>(London) According to the Times newspaper here, British Foreign Secretary Eden met with Japanese Ambassador to Britain Yoshida at the Foreign Office on Monday and expressed that Britain would very much like to know about the rumored agreement between the Japanese and German governments. British official opinion is that this agreement does exist and believes that its content is divided into two parts: (1) the exchange of German armaments and machinery for manufacturing armaments for Japanese goods; (2) a political agreement that, besides the two countries issuing a joint anti-communist declaration, would not contain anything else. (Eighth Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) According to diplomatic sources here today, Soviet Russian officials have obtained information proving that the rumored German-Japanese military alliance in Shanghai and Tokyo is not without cause. It is said that this alliance will ostensibly be a joint declaration against communism, but according to information obtained by Soviet Russia, the full text of the German-Japanese alliance will be kept secret, with only the part on joint anti-communism being made public. (Seventeenth National)</p>
<p>(London) After the news of the impending anti-communist agreement between Germany and Japan reached here, the general impression, especially in political circles, has been extremely negative. It is generally believed that if Italy joins this agreement in the future, the ongoing talks between Britain and Italy will be greatly hampered. One of the main purposes of Britain's attempt to approach Italy is to prevent "theoretical deviations," which British public opinion strongly opposes. Sir Samuel Hoare, the First Lord of the Admiralty, also criticized this at a meeting of the Foreign Press Association yesterday. (Eighteenth Havas)</p>
<h3>German and Japanese to Issue Joint Declaration - The Two Countries Share Anti-Communist Interests</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Although official circles here today deny that Germany and Japan have concluded a military alliance, they admit that it is "absolutely conceivable" and claim that Germany and Japan share the same interests in anti-communism. However, this treaty should be called an anti-communist alliance rather than an anti-Soviet alliance. (Seventeenth National Electric)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Some political figures have recently rumored that Germany and Japan will soon issue a joint official statement of great importance, but this news has not yet been officially confirmed. (Seventeenth Havas Electric)</p>
<h3>Contents of Agreement Reported by British - Contains Important Commercial Clauses</h3>
<p>The Chinese-language newspaper *Tzu Lin Pao* reports that a Shanghai resident who returned from Japan on Tuesday stated that, although Japanese authorities are conducting strict censorship of newspapers, it is widely rumored that the Japanese government has concluded a special agreement with Germany and Italy for joint anti-communism. It is believed that the agreement with Germany will be signed early next month and contains important commercial clauses. The most notable is the establishment of a commodity exchange, with Japan supplying soybeans to Germany and Germany supplying armaments and ammunition to Japan. Once the German-Japanese agreement is signed, Italy will also join. Although the Tokyo Foreign Ministry is maintaining strict silence on this matter and it is impossible to obtain any information about it, those closely observing the situation believe that the signing of the agreement is imminent.</p>
<p>According to German authorities, they have denied the claim that an agreement between Germany and Japan had been signed, but London has widely rumored this in the past two days. According to news from the second night of the week, people in London mostly believe that there must be this action between Germany and Japan. The British Broadcasting Corporation broadcast Sir Wythes' bi-weekly foreign affairs speech, paying special attention to this matter, saying that it was related to Hitler's recent declaration denying the Treaty of Versailles. However, according to Sir Wythes, Germany and Japan may not conclude a formal alliance, but may be seeking friendship with each other. Germany would certainly not want to give Japan a tongue-lashing, because Hitler has repeatedly declared that he wishes to maintain diplomatic relations with Britain, fearing that people will recognize this as a threat to Britain. If there is any plot between Germany and Japan, it is definitely not to harm Britain's maritime communications, but rather to seek to guarantee German-Japanese cooperation in dealing with the huge and solid barrier on the land route from Europe to the Asian Pacific coast.</p>
<h3>British Newspaper Commentary - Loss of Freedom of Action - Japan Gets Less Than It Pays For</h3>
<p>(London) *The Times* newspaper published a commentary on the Japanese-German understanding, stating that Japan's ability to imitate is well known to the world, but its recent speculative ventures may not be able to predict the profits of imitating the West as before. The newspaper further stated that the rumored alliance between Japan and Germany, if formally announced, will certainly be called a purely defensive nature. However, Soviet Russia's current aspirations are indeed for peace. Soviet Russia has proposed a non-aggression pact to Japan, but it has been rejected by Japan. The newspaper continued, "In the final analysis, the Japanese wording is not without reason, but Soviet Russian aggression has not yet materialized. A country's preparation for war cannot all be labeled as aggression." Japan's recent actions have made Japanese-Russian tensions increasingly ease, and its new alliance with Germany will cause general concern, believing that the area near the western border of Russia will once again be shrouded in worry. Japan has now gained two new friends, all of whom have a fondness for "recognizing obvious realities," so they have no tendency to accept the idiom of "binding obligations" when signing international agreements. Therefore, Japan's relationship with Soviet Russia has turned sour, and Japan's own freedom of action has also been hindered. What it has gained is clearly not worth what it has lost. Japan has also created obstacles to the future of friendship between Britain and Japan, because Britain's usual policy has been not to get involved in unnecessary disputes. (Eighteenth Reuters)</p>
<h3>Italian Newspaper Praises - Anti-Communist Front Extends to Far East - Another Proof of Italian-German Harmony</h3>
<p>(Rome) This morning, Italian newspapers praised the rumor that Germany and Japan have formed an anti-communist agreement. This can be regarded as another new proof of Italian-German harmony. The government mouthpiece, *Il Giornale d'Italia*, which is the most well-informed, today published an article by Guido Gayda, stating that the solidarity of Italy, Germany, and Japan is a broad struggle against communism, which is caused by the Soviet Russian communists' deliberate attempt to invade. The German-Japanese agreement announced today is a part of this defense. (Eighteenth Reuters)</p>
<p>(Rome) The semi-official newspaper *Il Giornale d'Italia* recently published important news stating that Germany and Japan have already formed an agreement, with Japan joining the anti-communist front previously formed by Italy and Germany. It stated, "This anti-communist front was established by Italy and Germany during talks in Berlin, and was later expanded to include Austria and Hungary at the Vienna Conference of the three countries, Italy, Austria and Hungary. In less than a month, it has been extended to the Far East, with Japan participating. The Third International held a conference in July and August last year, and its work was tantamount to a public declaration of war against fascist countries. This combination of Italy, Germany, and Japan is a defensive action against communism, and its purpose is to protect the greatest achievements of world culture, as well as the spiritual and material well-being of all countries. It is a natural result of the Soviet communist invasion plan." According to Italian newspapers, only *Il Giornale d'Italia* has mentioned the establishment of an agreement between Japan and Germany. Political figures claim that there is currently only foreign news to rely on for this matter, and it cannot be verified. (Seventeenth Havas)</p>
<h3>Germany Forges Contract - Puppet State Purchases Machinery from Germany - to Refine Synthetic Petroleum</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Kato, the commercial commissioner of the "Manchukuo" stationed in Germany, plans to sign a contract worth 12 million marks with a major German company within days. The company will supply the "Manchukuo" with the machinery needed for a coal hydrogenation plant, stipulating that the goods will be shipped over a certain number of years. The "Manchukuo" will deduct 2 million marks from the purchase price as a license fee for the company to refine synthetic oil from coal in "Manchukuo". Other important transactions are also being considered, such as the import of railway locomotives and iron melting furnaces to "Manchukuo". The newly appointed German commercial commissioner to "Manchukuo" will depart from Berlin for Manchuria soon. (Seventeenth Reuters)</p>
<h3>Japanese-Russian Fisheries Treaty - Validity Extended by Eight Years - to be Signed Tomorrow in Russian Capital</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Privy Council regular general meeting was held this morning with the Emperor in attendance. The consultation proposal as follows (1) Regarding the extension of the validity of the fisheries treaty between Japan and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the signing of its agreed protocol and attached documents (consisting of one protocol, three exchanges of official letters, and one record of the meeting). The important point is that the current treaty's effective period, which should expire at the end of December of this year, is now extended by eight years. At the same time, the exchange of official letters stipulates various regulations for the purpose of stabilizing fishing areas. The report of the contents of the proposal and the process and results of the review committee was given by Committee Chairman Arai. As a result of the deliberations, there were no objections and it was passed as originally proposed. Therefore, after the case is issued, the government will submit it to the cabinet for a decision. Then, Foreign Minister Arita telegraphed acting ambassador Sakoh in Moscow to formally sign the agreement with Soviet representative Kazinovsky, the Minister of the Far East, in Moscow on the 20th (18th Allied Press)</p>
<h3>Russian Envoy Visits Arita Again - Exchange of Views on Border Issues</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Russian ambassador to Japan visited Foreign Minister Arita again on the afternoon of the 17th to exchange important views on border issues. Regarding the establishment area, agenda, and composition of the dispute committee, the Russian envoy reiterated the claims made during the meeting on the 16th, and added that a temporary committee should be established first to handle the Jin Chang Gou incident. Arita's response to this was generally in accordance with his decision: (1) The Japanese government has no objections to the establishment of a border dispute settlement committee covering the entire national border, but it must be established in parallel with the border demarcation committee. (2) The Russian government proposes to establish committees in the eastern border within two months after the establishment of the two committees, but Japan opposes limiting the time limit for the establishment of the committee. (3) The agenda of the dispute settlement committee does not need to adopt past incidents, and there is no urgent need for a temporary committee. Arita further asserted Japan's established policy on the issue of the committee's composition, and proposed that all negotiations be entrusted to the Togo-Lavette Conference, but the Russian side did not give in, and the meeting on that day failed to reach a conclusion and broke up.

<h3>Arrested German Nationals - Soviet Union Announces Charges - Engaged in Fascist Propaganda - Conspiring in Espionage and Terrorist Activities</h3>
<p>(Moscow) According to reports here, the Soviet People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs arrested several Germans in Moscow and Leningrad earlier this month because they were secretly engaged in activities harmful to the Soviet Union. Those arrested include Barth, Klein, Furtnäschel, Demisch, Trinkaus, Fischer, Oberburg, Morsch, Niedermeier and Gorschmidt, etc. The charges against those arrested are: attempting to entice Soviet citizens to form Fascist cells, spreading Fascist propaganda to them, illegally distributing Fascist documents, spying on military secrets for a certain foreign country, and attempting to obtain important state secret information, etc. Another part of those arrested had also carried out sabotage of state-owned industries and prepared to carry out terrorist measures against Soviet government leaders. The circumstances of the crime are still under investigation. (Eighteenth TASS Electric)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet Russian Foreign Affairs People's Commissar Litvinov today notified the German ambassador to Russia that some of the German nationals who were arrested a few days ago on charges of engaging in anti-Soviet Russian activities, most of whom admitted to having engaged in espionage in both military and economic fields, or spreading Fascist literature among Soviet Russian civilians, or conspiring in terrorist actions. The German ambassador then replied with a letter, admitting that National Socialist party organizations do exist in other countries, but denying that there are such organizations in Soviet Russia.</p>
<p>Litvinov told the German ambassador that two of the arrested German nationals did not have serious evidence of criminal activity and appeared to be about to be released and deported. (Seventeenth Reuters)</p>

<p>(Rome) France, which abolished the clauses in the Treaty of Versailles related to navigation by Germany, has now invited various countries to protest to Germany. Italy has rejected it. (Eighteenth Reuters)</p>
<p>(Warsaw) After the German government unilaterally announced the abolition of the clauses in the Treaty of Versailles regarding the free navigation of ships of various countries in certain German rivers, officials here believe that it is futile to protest to Germany. Therefore, the Polish government does not intend to do so. Business circles, on the other hand, are quite concerned about the future navigation system of the Kiel Canal, as many Polish ships enter and exit the German Kiel Canal. (Note: The Kiel Canal connects the Baltic Sea and the North Sea, and the Treaty of Versailles stipulates that warships and merchant ships of all countries may pass freely.

<p>(Geneva) Regarding Germany's abrogation of the treaty, the French government has made proposals to the countries concerned, advocating a joint protest to Germany.

<h3>British First Lord of the Admiralty's Speech - International Situation - Britain Decides to Use Authority - to Avert World War</h3>
<p>(London) The Foreign Press Association recently held a gathering here, when the First Lord of the Admiralty, Sir Samuel Hoare, gave a speech, stating that some say that war is inevitable, but I dare not believe it deeply. "We are now determined to use our country's authority and power in all parts of the world to prevent this prediction from becoming a reality." He then analyzed the essentials of British policy in terms of spirit and ideology, saying that Britain is not only a European country, but is also closely related to events in all countries of the world, but Britain is determined to refuse to participate in the prevailing ideological war (referring to the struggle between Fascism and Communism). This is no different from the fact that in the 17th century, European countries were all engaged in religious wars, but our country alone was not involved in the vortex.

<h3>German and Turkish - Economic Talks - Strengthening Germany's Trade Position - Schacht Will Go to the Capitals of Romania and Iran - to Persuade them to Join the Anti-Communist Group</h3>
<p>Turkish Capital - German Minister of Economy and President of Deutsche Bank Dr. Hjalmar Schacht has been visiting here for several days. It is heard that he still intends to take a plane to the capital of Iran (i.e., Persia), and then return home. When passing through the capital of Romania on the way, he also intends to stay for a while. According to well-informed sources, Turkish trade with Germany accounts for 62 percent of its total foreign trade, which is the lifeline of Turkey's economy. The main purpose of Dr. Schacht's visit to Turkey is to enhance the status of German business in Turkey and to strike a blow to British forces. In addition, it is generally believed that Schacht's visits to Turkey, Iran, and Romania are intended to persuade those countries to join the anti-communist group. (Nineteenth Havas Electric)</p>

Both Germany and Belgium must abandon past grievances and jointly devote themselves to the work of anti-communism. He also said that Belgium's foreign policy has now changed course (referring to King Leopold III of Belgium's declaration of neutrality last month), and that it is aware of the dangers of communism, which is very gratifying.

<h3>Imprisonment and Escape Leads to False Accusations - French Interior Minister Commits Suicide in Indignation - Opens Gas Valve and Suffocates to Death - Still Handling Government Affairs the Day Before</h3>
<p>Lille - After the mayor of this city and Minister of the Interior, Roger Salengro, committed suicide, the doctor stated that he suffocated himself with gas at 11:00 last night. His body was found in the kitchen at 9:00 this morning. Salengro's wife died suddenly in May of last year, also in this place, which is also strange. First, Salengro had been dealing with affairs all night the night before, and only finished at 8:15 yesterday morning. Because Premier Léon Blum was scheduled to come here on official business next Sunday, he prepared everything for it yesterday morning. Later, he met with trade union representatives and expressed his indignation at the wanton attacks by the right-wing weekly "Gringoire", saying that the newspaper disregarded right and wrong, added false accusations, and was deeply hated. After that, he did not eat any more, and finally committed suicide. Alas! (Eighteenth Havas Electric)</p>
<p>French Stare - Roger Salengro, the mayor and interior minister of this city, has passed away. It is now known that Salengro took his own life. His younger brother recently gave a speech to newspaper reporters, saying that his elder brother lost his wife in May of last year, and that many close relatives had died one after another, causing him great mental distress. Recently, the right-wing weekly "Gringoire" attacked him again, saying that he deserted during the European War and was sentenced to death by a military court. Although Chief of the Army Staff General Gamelin, along with several veterans of distinguished reputation, organized a committee to review the facts and clarify that he was innocent, and the House of Representatives passed a motion of confidence with a majority of 421 votes to 63, his spirit was even more depressed after being subjected to this false accusation, which led to a tragic change. He also said that after his brother was captured during the European War, the German army forced him to work in a steel mill, but his brother refused to obey, and was sentenced to two years of hard labor by a German military court. This is enough to show his loyalty to the motherland. (Eighteenth Havas)</p>
<p>French Lille - Roger Salengro was born in 1890 and is originally from this city. He was 46 years old this year and liked to write political commentary throughout his life, and his works were published in various newspapers and magazines. He was first elected as a member of the provincial council of the Nord province, and was later elected as a member of the Chamber of Deputies in 1928. In 1932 and this year, he was elected to consecutive terms. He was one of the leaders of the Socialist Party. In June of this year, when Premier Léon Blum organized the cabinet, he invited him to join the cabinet and serve as Minister of the Interior, and relied on him deeply. He made great contributions to resolving labor disputes. (Eighteenth Havas Electric)</p>
<h3>Western Rebel Army Uses Incendiary Bombs, Madrid Ablaze, City Center Reduced to Rubble, Countless Dead and Wounded</h3>
<p>Madrid - Our correspondent Fei Xiadet reports, aircraft belonging to the Nationalist army flew over the city center this morning at 5:00 AM and 8:00 AM, dropping incendiary bombs, especially in the San Miguel market. At the time, the market was bustling with activity, and many housewives were carrying baskets to the market, resulting in numerous deaths from the bombs. However, the exact number is unknown. Since the start of the civil war, this is the first time Nationalist army aircraft have used incendiary bombs. Last night and this morning, fires broke out all over the city, and firefighters worked tirelessly throughout the night to put out the blazes, but they were overwhelmed. Rubble was everywhere, and workers were busy clearing debris. In addition, the streets were littered with dead and wounded, and ambulances were transporting them. In one house on Saint Augustine Avenue alone, more than thirty bodies were found. This morning, the reporter inspected the streets and found that shops and residences on both sides of the streets had suffered significant damage. The air was filled with thick smoke and the smell of gunpowder, which was nauseating. The sight was heartbreaking and terrifying. As for the war situation, it is reported that there are no traces of the Nationalist army's Moroccan troops in the area of the Frasque Institute in the northwestern suburbs. The first line of defense there is now manned by security forces affiliated with the government army, and the second and third lines of defense are manned by civilian militias. Many cannons have also been transported to the front lines and will be used by artillery units to bombard the Nationalist army's positions. However, the opposing artillery units are not showing any weakness, and many Nationalist army shells have landed in the northwestern district. In total, since the fierce fighting began in March, 200 officers and over 500 soldiers have been killed or wounded. Although the government is preoccupied with the war, the House of Representatives will still meet on December 1st, but due to the ongoing fighting, it is planned to move the meeting to Valencia. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Madrid - Aircraft belonging to the Nationalist army bombed the city with incendiary bombs twice yesterday morning. The ferocity was unprecedented since the start of the war. Fires caused by the bombs were everywhere in the suburbs. Several bombs also hit Sun Square and the surrounding streets in the city, and the busy area was almost completely destroyed. In the evening, more aircraft conducted night raids, and loud explosions could be heard throughout the night. When the bombs landed, flashes of light illuminated the streets, as if it were daytime. The telephone exchange building, which is seventeen stories high and the tallest building in the capital, is also the gathering place for journalists from various countries. A bomb landed twenty meters away from the building, and the ground shook with a loud bang. The ferocity can be imagined. Houses near the bomb site caught fire immediately, and firefighters rushed to the scene to put out the blaze, but the fire was raging and continued to spread. At night, as far as the eye could see, the sky was ablaze, and fire engines raced back and forth on the streets. Although it is difficult to estimate the number of casualties and the extent of the damage, it is estimated that at least 300 people were killed and 700 wounded. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>Madrid - The famous Alba Palace in Spain caught fire today after being hit by rebel incendiary bombs. The entire fourth floor has been destroyed, and the entire building is unlikely to be saved. Servants and militiamen only managed to salvage a few valuable paintings. Two nearby houses have also caught fire, and the flames are reaching fifty feet high, spreading towards the city center. (Guomin, 17th)</p>
<p>Madrid - Aircraft belonging to the Nationalist army flew over the city yesterday and carried out large-scale bombings. According to official reports, 250 people were killed and 800 wounded in the raids. Since the beginning of this week, a total of 500 people have been killed and 1,200 injured, most of whom are women and children.

<p>Madrid - Nationalist army artillery units continue to bombard the city today, causing the capital's destruction to progress daily. The recent bombardment has been the most intense since the start of the Spanish Civil War. Although it is said that at least 200 people have been killed and 500 wounded in the past three days, the exact number of casualties is still difficult to estimate. Today, a bomb hit the Romanian embassy, but the embassy staff had moved out 48 hours earlier, so there were no casualties. However, a house next to the embassy was destroyed at the same time, killing nine people. The telephone company building, one of the tallest buildings in Europe, seems to be one of the main targets of the Nationalist army's bombardment. The Montana and Mankeno barracks were also heavily bombarded. Several bombs landed in the area of the Royal Palace, the Italian embassy, and the headquarters of the Western Guard, causing thick smoke and dust to fill the sky, making it difficult to determine the extent of the damage. Residents in the suburbs of the capital have long since been evacuated, and the area has become a war zone.</p>
<p>The capital is subjected to intense bombardment day and night, almost without interruption. Aerial torpedoes and explosive and incendiary shells cause fire and smoke to erupt wherever they land. The prosperous capital will gradually be reduced to a huge field of rubble. The seventeen-story telephone company building is the target of the Nationalist army's artillery bombardment, and shells have also landed in the vicinity. Several foreign reporters were gathered in a room in the building, waiting for international phone calls, when a shell suddenly pierced a hole in the room. Many of the buildings on the main streets are currently on fire. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<h3>Western Government Army's Counter-Offensive Plan, Rebel Army Penetrates Madrid</h3>
<p>(London) The British Embassy in Madrid reported today the government army's counter-offensive plan as follows: (1) Advance south and southeast from the capital, first attacking the rebel army's rear; (2) Advance towards Aranjuez and Toledo. Currently, the civilian militia defending the capital numbers 100,000, while the rebel army only has 45,000, of which 25,000 are currently concentrated in the Madrid area, and the remaining 20,000 are stationed between Madrid and Toledo. In addition, the government army and the rebel army each have 15,000 troops stationed north and northwest of the capital, who have not yet participated in the fighting. (Guomin, 17th)</p>
<p>Outside Madrid, in the rebel army camp, the rebel army has indeed achieved victory in its attack on the Manzanares River. An Associated Press reporter braved the shelling today to get within twenty meters of the city, which is still under rebel control. However, journalists are not allowed to enter the city. The streets of the city are still full of sandbags, vehicles, furniture, and other defensive structures. (Guomin, 17th)</p>
<h3>Rebel Army War Report</h3>
<p>Salamanca - The Nationalist army's general headquarters announced in a communiqué that our army has won two consecutive victories in the vicinity of Madrid. Under the cover of artillery and aircraft, our troops crossed the Manzanares River yesterday morning and occupied various buildings in the northwestern suburbs university district, and continued to advance. Although the government army resisted stubbornly, our army still advanced towards the West Park and the main street in front of the North Station. All the places occupied are strategically important locations, which the government army is also well aware of. They immediately launched a counter-offensive, but it was repulsed by our army. Even the "International Brigade," composed of leftists from various countries, could not withstand the attack and retreated, abandoning over a hundred corpses. The outcome of this battle is enough to shake the morale of the government army, because the "International Brigade" is known for its fighting prowess and is relied upon by the government. After this battle, the government will naturally realize the true value of this unit. Yesterday, aircraft belonging to the Nationalist army also dropped bombs on the army headquarters and the Montaña Barracks in the city. In addition, the government army launched an offensive on the Guadarrama Mountains front in the north, but was also repulsed by our army. In the Pisueña province in the northwest, the Nationalist army and the government army engaged in fierce artillery battles. There have been no other significant developments on other fronts. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>Seville - General Deriano, commander-in-chief of the Nationalist army's southern front, announced in a broadcast message, "The Nationalist army's attack on the city of Madrid is continuing. Although the enemy is resisting desperately, our army is fighting with unparalleled bravery. After the great victory in the northwestern suburbs university district yesterday, our army's range of activity has greatly expanded. The enemy launched several counter-offensives, but was repulsed. In addition, the government army's civilian militia is digging trenches and holding fast in the Montaña Barracks and the Rochaire Street area in the city. Nationalist army aircraft have bombed them and dropped several tons of bombs, setting the barracks ablaze. (Havas, 18th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Surveying the Population of Important Cities in the Northeast, Implementing Control to Strictly Prevent the Activities of the Righteous Army, The Japanese Population is Increasing and Their Influence is Expanding</h3>
<p>Changchun Correspondence, The Japanese are most diligent in surveying the population of important cities in our Northeast, with the intention of strictly controlling the people of the Northeast and using it to strictly prevent the infiltration of the Righteous Army. In addition, it can also be known the statistics of the increase of Japanese in the Northeast, and the expansion of Japanese power. The statistics of the population of major cities in the Northeast surveyed by the Japanese at the end of October are listed below (including the South Manchuria Railway affiliated area):</p>
<h3>A Huge Forest Discovered in the Upper Reaches of the Songhua River, Enough to Provide Twenty Years of Logging, Now Willingly Given to the Japanese to Enjoy</h3>
<p>Changchun Correspondence, According to the report of the Japanese forest survey team's logging and surveying team, a large forest, the only one in the Northeast, was recently discovered on the Gudong River bank in the upper reaches of the Songhua River. The area is rarely visited and is a primeval tree sea, a surprisingly coniferous mixed virgin forest. Among them, coniferous trees account for seven parts, and broad-leaved trees account for three parts. They are ancient pines of red and white interspersed, all reaching seventy or eighty feet, and can extract perfect knot-free wood. If 600,000 stones are logged each year in the future, it can provide a long-term continuous logging for twenty years. The Japanese are very fortunate to have obtained this, but unfortunately our great resources are willingly given to others to enjoy.</p>
<h3>Fujian Security Office Arrests Lei Zoulu in Xiamen, Lei Was Originally an Old Subordinate of Chen Guohui, The Case is Serious and Involves Certain Suspicions</h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence, At about 12:00 p.m. on the 15th, the Xiamen Public Security Bureau received an order from the Provincial Security Office to arrest Lei Zoulu, manager of the Yinan Qianzhuang Three Spring Foreign Building in Xiamen, supervisor of the Xiamen Chamber of Commerce, and executive member of the Overseas Chinese Association, and escort him to the province. The bureau immediately dispatched detectives to Lei's private residence in Xiaozhi on Gongyuan North Road at 3:00 a.m. on the 16th and arrested Lei. At 9:00 a.m. on the morning of the 16th, staff members were sent to escort the detectives to the Haining ship to escort Lei to the province. When Lei was at the Public Security Bureau, he was not allowed to meet with relatives and friends. When he got off the ship, the detectives held guns around him, and the situation was serious. The authorities have not announced the reason for the arrest, but the case is serious and there are certain suspicions. After Lei was arrested, Yinan Sanchun appealed to the Chamber of Commerce for bail. The Chamber of Commerce did not decide for a long time because the case was unclear. According to Lei, he is from Nan'an, in his forties, and was an old subordinate of Chen Guohui. When Chen was alive, he moved to Quanyongxinglong and other places in the early days of the militia. Chen's troops were reorganized twice. Finally, Chen was appointed as the brigade commander of the First Mixed Brigade of the Provincial Defense Army, with nearly 10,000 troops stationed in Xingquanyong and other places for more than ten years, and Lei was responsible for managing finances. Chen's private property was also managed by Lei. The Yinan Sanchun were operated with funds invested by Chen. In the winter of 1932, after Chen was shot, Lei claimed to be a wealthy man in Xiamen. This summer, Lei and Chen's third concubine, Ye Xiulian, were involved in a lawsuit over inheritance for several months. Chen's estate is rumored to be 8 million yuan. Even the numbers cited by Ye Xiulian that can be verified are nearly 4 million yuan. This time, Lei was arrested. According to reports here, Chen Guohui's old subordinates have all pledged their loyalty to the government. However, Chen Weijin of Nan'an refused to accept the reorganization, hid his weapons and did not hand them over, and fled to Tokyo, Japan, to collude with a certain party. Recently, the authorities discovered that Lei had contacts with Chen, which may be one of the reasons for his arrest. (November 18)</p>
<h3>Kunshan Silver Shop Suffers Miserable Theft</h3>
<p>Taihe Silver Shop in Zhongda Street in our county has been open for more than 30 years, with strong capital and good business. At about 1:00 a.m. on the 17th, it was suddenly visited by a giant thief, who stole 150 taels of gold and pure silver banknotes from the safe, worth more than 30,000 yuan. It was not discovered until dawn, and the thief had already fled far away. The county was notified to investigate, and the shop checked the loss list to strictly arrest the thief and bring him to justice.</p>
<h3>Preparations for Winter Defense in Various Districts</h3>
<p>As winter is approaching and bandits are prone to rampage, the various district offices have recently joined forces with the local public security bureaus to actively prepare for winter defense. They immediately jointly organize a watch team and use the baojia force to strictly arrest the bandit atmosphere. At the same time, the water public security team is also inspecting ships to prevent them.</p>
<h3>Suzhou, Da Jue Gets Life, Appeal Rejected</h3>
<p>He Cangyun and Li Gan, students of Shanghai St. John's University, had a dispute with Zhang Yuanquan, the school's cook, on July 18 of this year because a fly was found in the egg fried rice, and even violently beat him. Zhang Yuanquan died of his injuries after being injured. The police sent the two students He and Li to the Shanghai District Court, sentencing He Cangyun to three years and six months in prison, and Li Gan was acquitted. He refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the Jiangsu Higher Court. After repeated trials, it has ended and was sentenced on the 18th, the appeal was rejected.</p>
<h3>Sparse Rental Income After Opening Granaries</h3>
<p>Landowners and granary owners in the Suzhou area opened their granaries to collect rent starting on the 11th. However, since the granaries opened, the gates of each granary have been deserted, and the rental income has not improved. As a result, the landowners are very hesitant. The remedy will be a joint effort by the granaries to set up joint rental granaries in various rural areas so that tenants in each rural area can pay their rent locally. On the other hand, they are actively preparing to pursue rent arrears. The Land Rent Disposal Office, organized by the county government, has been officially established and has begun its work, recruiting one hundred temporary police officers to urge rent payments. The examination is scheduled for the 22nd, and those who pass will receive a monthly salary of ten yuan and be sent to various rural areas to urge and collect rent rice. Furthermore, concerning the issue of universal tax reduction for landowners, the provincial authorities insist on collecting the full amount, which is deemed unsatisfactory. They have nominated Qian Zichu and Sheng Zhenbiao, among four representatives, to meet with County Magistrate Deng to request that the provincial authorities review and reduce the taxes to achieve the goal of actually collecting 90%. However, it is unknown whether this will be possible.</p>
<h3>Planned Construction of More Highways</h3>
<p>Recently, a dense network of highways has been established between neighboring counties of Suzhou, facilitating transportation. Now, the Bureau of Construction has also been ordered to plan and construct a motor road from Wuta to Xiangcheng and from Xiangcheng to Likou, adding another route to the transportation between Suzhou and Changzhou. In addition, a wooden bridge has been decided to be built across the river outside Changmen Old Fifth Regiment to the Xiyuan Jiezhuang Temple on the opposite bank, which requires detouring around the Shangxia Jin Bridge, to facilitate traffic.</p>
<h3>County Government Improves Rice Varieties</h3>
<p>The rice crop test field of the province has achieved excellent results this autumn harvest. The county government has recently been ordered to purchase new rice varieties from the field and expand the new planting area next spring. It is stipulated that at least one-tenth of the land in each rural area must be converted to planting new rice varieties.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Commercial and Educational Circles Launch Aid-Sui Movement</h3>
<p>As bandits and puppets invade Suiyuan, our loyal and brave soldiers on the front lines have risen up to resist and defend the country. All sectors of the country have launched fund-raising campaigns to express their condolences. In Xiyi, the commercial youth were the first to respond, raising dozens of yuan in one day. Once a round sum is raised, it will be remitted to Sui to comfort Chairman Chuan and the generals. Teachers and students of the Provincial College of Education are also actively planning donation methods. It has been decided that teachers will contribute 5% of their monthly salary, and students will uniformly reduce food intake for four days. During these four days, everyone will eat vegetarian food, and the savings, together with the teachers' salary deductions, will total more than 300 yuan. Other schools have also launched fund-raising campaigns to aid Sui.</p>
<h3>Exchanging Fractional Currency for Legal Tender</h3>
<p>Grain merchants and others in this county are unable to exchange fractional currency for national currency at any time at various banks. The financial turnover of small businesses is affected. The fractional currency is collected by the Xuzhou Official Money Bureau from the Wuxi Chenmin Bank, and the Jiangsu Farmers Bank is collected by the Jiangsu Bank. The Central Bank only collects broken fractional currency from the Bank of China. If the fractional currency is in good condition, it will not be accepted. The Four Provinces Qingmin Bank and the Zhejiang Local Bank do not have exchange offices, making it even more difficult to exchange the currency. They jointly sent a letter to the County Chamber of Commerce, asking for help. The Chamber of Commerce's representatives at the General Meeting decided that in addition to sending a letter to the Bankers' Association to notify each bank to collect and circulate the currency at any time, they also sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance yesterday, requesting that it order all banks to comply. They also requested the Four Provinces Farmers Bank and the Zhejiang Local Bank to quickly set up exchange offices in Xi to maintain monetary credit.</p>
<h3>Busy Canal Vouchers Used to Pay Land Tax</h3>
<p>The county government of this county has received instructions from the Suzhou Finance Department that the busy canal vouchers of this county must be cleared within a time limit. It has ordered the township chiefs of each district and township to notify each recognized household to bring the unreturned principal and interest of each period of the voucher to the grain counter to pay off the land tax. However, the deadline is approaching, and there are still a few recognized households who have failed to pay off the tax within the time limit, which is a negligent act. A special notice was issued yesterday to inform everyone, urging each recognized household to pay off the tax within the time limit to complete the procedures and end the process.</p>
<h3>Arrest of Coin-Buying Criminals</h3>
<p>Police officers from the Public Security Bureau intercepted Zhang Zidao and Liu Guowang, two criminals who were buying coins, at the South Dou Wai bus station on the afternoon of the 17th. They seized 2,400 yuan in cash used to buy coins. They were then sent to the county government, where they were interrogated by Inspector Xu. According to Zhang and Liu, they were both employees of the Liyuan Money Shop in Hongkou, Shanghai, buying coins on behalf of the Agricultural and Commercial Bank, and were not involved in illegal outflow. Since August of this year, they have collected more than 20,000 yuan in Changzhou, adding two or three cents per yuan. We can earn four or five cents. However, all the coins collected are entrusted to the Bank of Communications for remittance. As for the cash collection from the Qian Merchant Bank, they have receipts, etc. As a result, the interrogating officer believed that the two criminals, regardless of whether their actions were legitimate or not, had not reported to the local authorities in advance and were buying coins everywhere, which was suspicious. He ordered them to pay 9,000 yuan in cash as bail and conduct further investigation. Subsequently, the two criminals were detained because they could not provide bail.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin: Transfer of Trial Officer by the High Court</h3>
<p>Shen Yuan, the trial officer of this county, was accused of bribery for granting bail to Shen Qingcheng, a red pill drug offender. The High Court sent a prosecutor from the Wuxi Court to Cheng to investigate and report. The High Court ordered Shen Cheng on the 17th to be transferred to the court, and Li Ruilong, a trial officer from Suqian, was appointed as his replacement.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Two Elementary Schools Donate to Support Sui</h3>
<p>Yangzhou Experimental Elementary School, because the Suiyuan former soldiers bravely fought against the war for the survival of the country and the nation, specifically convened a school affairs meeting the other day, unanimously passed the condolence to the national defense front-line soldiers to raise donations. The fundraising will begin immediately. Once the bullying has become a number, it will be sent immediately. In addition, the private Zhengyi Elementary School in this port also convened the Student Federation yesterday and resolved that each junior child would pay at least one dime and senior children would pay at least two dimes to comfort the soldiers in front. A letter was sent to the parents and a letter was sent to the children of each school, calling for unanimous effort.</p>
<h3>Two Advantages in Tax Revenue Performance</h3>
<p>The Jiangdu County's twenty-fourth year of land tax has reached 85% of the ten-year target. On the 16th, County Magistrate Ma specially gathered township chiefs from each district to compare and urge grain collection results. More than 50 people were rewarded, with the best awarded with something and the second best awarded one yuan each. List the grain households that completed 50% of the task and send them to each township to continue urging collection (major households will still be sent to political police to pursue). In the end, all the work will be completed. Although the deed tax ratio was slightly increased this year, from July to the end of September this year, the actual deed tax revenue exceeded 9,260 yuan according to the increased ratio. On the 16th, the Finance Department issued instructions, praising the county for its efforts in urging tax collection and ordered it to continue to supervise its subordinates and continue to work hard.</p>
<h3>Luhe: Suspicious Monks and Taoists Arrested</h3>
<p>A monk and two Taoists suddenly came to Guabuzhen in the third district of the county and checked into the Caishen Temple. They claimed to have come from the Gusongshu Temple in Jiuhua Mountain and had been begging for alms on the street for three days. However, their actions were suspicious and they looked like traitors. The county's special agent received a report and went to the district to arrest them on the spot. After detailed interrogation, the monks and Taoists gave vague answers and a black paper silver character central literature fan was found. The monk had no precepts scars on his head and no alms-begging documents. They have now been sent to the county government for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Elderly Man in His Sixties Trafficking Drugs</h3>
<p>The inspection police stationed in Yaogang seized Xu Aqi, a morphine trafficker in his sixties, at the port. Morphine needles and seventy-three packages of morphine were found. He has been sent to the county government by the Public Security Bureau for legal processing. The epidemic in Tongru has been eliminated. The epidemic prevention team returned to the city on the 17th. During this period, more than 40,000 patients were cured. The epidemic prevention association ended on the same day.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou: Unexpected Soaring of Egg Prices</h3>
<p>The export of eggs in this county has greatly decreased due to the sharp decline in output in various villages. Demand is quite high. The selling price has repeatedly soared and has been increasing day by day, which is quite unexpected. On the 16th, the price rose to 25 yuan per 100 jin, which is more than 2 yuan per 100 jin higher than two days ago.</p>
<h3>Ningbo: Public Security Bureau Prevents Traitors</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Public Security Bureau believes that the current national crisis is serious, and it is deeply feared that there are people with bad intentions who are exploited and act as traitors, spying on local conditions and secretly communicating information. It is necessary to conduct thorough investigations to prevent and deter them. If there are foreign monks, Taoists, and nuns passing through and staying in various hotels and inns in the future, they will only be allowed to stay for one day. If they stay longer, they will be strictly expelled. An order has been issued to all hotels and inns to comply with this.</p>

<p>Comfort and Relief Delegation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Local Association, and the General Association of the Chinese Red Cross have jointly formed the Suiyuan Bandit Suppression Comfort and Relief Committee, which was officially established yesterday and has begun operations. The following is a record of the various letters and telegrams issued:</p>
<p>Telegram to the Central Government</p>
<p>To Chairman Lin of the National Government of Nanjing, Premier Jiang of the Executive Yuan, and Chairman Jiang of the Military Affairs Commission: The bandits and rebels have invaded, and the soldiers defending the territory, under the guidance of the Central Government, have bravely fought and suppressed them, displaying great righteousness that has shaken the heavens and aroused public sentiment. Now, various organizations in Shanghai have decided to jointly form the Suiyuan Bandit Suppression Comfort and Relief Committee to raise donations and provide support. Sui is a crucial shield for the Northwest, and the Central Government, coordinating the overall situation, must have grand plans. We earnestly request that you constantly encourage the soldiers on the front lines to extinguish the flames of the bandits and secure the frontier. We respectfully submit this telegram, hoping for your attention and acceptance. Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Du Yuesheng, Chairman of the Shanghai Local Association, and others respectfully kowtow.</p>
<p>Telegram to Chairman Chuan</p>
<p>To Chairman Chuan of Suiyuan: Your deleted telegram should have been received. Seeing in the newspapers these days that you are leading your soldiers, braving the snow to suppress the bandits, your reputation has spread, and the whole country is inspired. Various organizations in Shanghai have now jointly formed the Suiyuan Bandit Suppression Comfort and Relief Committee to raise donations and provide practical assistance. Sui is located on the front lines of national defense and is a crucial shield for the Northwest, and is of great importance. We pray that you will supervise your subordinates to continue killing the bandits, and to firmly consolidate the border area. With the suppression of the bandits in sight, our thoughts are with you. Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Du Yuesheng, Chairman of the Shanghai Local Association, and others respectfully kowtow.</p>
<p>Donation Announcement</p>
<p>The Comfort and Relief Committee issued a donation announcement yesterday, stating: Suiyuan is located on the front lines of national defense and is a crucial shield for the Northwest, which is of great importance. This time, bandits and puppets invaded, and Chairman Chuan led all his soldiers to bravely resist, which has inspired the hearts of people across the country. However, fighting in the freezing weather is difficult, and the soldiers urgently need comfort, and the compatriots also need relief. Therefore, this committee has launched a campaign to raise funds, believing that the national crisis has reached its extreme, and the life of the nation hangs by a thread. Saving the country and saving oneself is urgent. We hope that people from all walks of life will generously donate and contribute, strengthening the soldiers' determination to defend the country and helping our compatriots in need. This is a matter of benevolence and righteousness. We sincerely announce this, hoping that you will take note. Committee members: Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Chen Guangfu, Liu Hongsheng, Wang Rutang, Qin Runqing, Qian Xinzhi, Xu Jikun, Wu Zhai, Shao Yanshan, Li Fusun, Mu Ouchu, Jiang Wenyu, Lin Kanghou, Pei Yunqing, Hu Yunqiu, Yan Fuqing, Jin Runxiang, Gui Yanfang, Ke Ganchen, Shen Zhongyi, Huang Renzhi, Pang Jingzhou, Yan Esheng. Economic Committee members: Du Yuesheng, Chen Guangfu, Qian Xinzhi, Qin Runqing, Li Fusun, Shao Yanshan, Pei Yunqing. Donation receiving agencies: Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Shanghai Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Zhonghui Bank, Jin Cheng Bank, Continental Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Salt Industry Bank, Zhongnan Bank, Four Banks Savings Association, Fuyuan Money Shop, Tongyu Money Shop, Tongrun Money Shop.</p>
<h3>Various Trade Associations</h3>
<p>One hundred and twenty-four trade associations, including the silk and satin industry, jointly sent a telegram of condolence to Chairman Fu of Suiyuan yesterday, saying: "In recent days, the bandit and puppet allied forces have launched a large-scale invasion. You have led your soldiers loyally and bravely to defend the country, which has inspired all compatriots. We pray that you will strictly organize your troops, make persistent efforts, defeat the enemy's flames, and consolidate our defenses. Our associations are actively raising donations to provide comfort. We first send this telegram to express our wishes for your success." Shanghai Silk Industry, Cotton Cloth Industry, Paper Industry, Pharmaceutical Factory Industry, Woolen Industry, Mineral Ash Factory Industry, Knitting Industry, National Goods Rubber Products Industry, and one hundred and twenty-four other trade associations respectfully inquired.</p>
<p>The Colored Printing Industry Association suggested in a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce: "We respectfully inform you that, as reported in the newspapers these days, bandits and puppet troops have invaded Suiyuan, and enemy planes and tanks are assisting in the battle. Our army is defending the country and bravely resisting, which has inspired all the people of the country. However, the soldiers on the front lines defending the territory and protecting the people have already made their determination, and the people in the rear have an unshirkable responsibility to provide relief and assistance. The north is cold, unlike the south. It is reported that it has already snowed in the border area. Defending the territory and resisting the war is the unanimous demand of our people across the country. Now that the soldiers on the front lines in Suiyuan are fighting in the freezing weather to fight for the survival of the Chinese nation, how should our people in the rear raise funds as soon as possible to provide assistance and strengthen their support? As in the previous example of congratulating the birthday, we should still use one day's income to send to the front lines to purchase cold-weather clothing. This matter is urgent, so we specially send this letter as a suggestion, hoping for your approval. Please immediately notify all trade associations in the city, and all shops, factories, shop assistants, and workers should implement this within a limited time. Those who voluntarily donate more are welcome to donate more. We should also send telegrams to all provinces and cities across the country to imitate this practice to show the determination of our people across the country to fight against the enemy with shared hatred and to let the soldiers on the front lines know that they have the support of the people, so as to achieve greater results in killing the enemy. Is this appropriate? We hope for your decision." Sincerely, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3>Colleagues of Two Railway Bureaus</h3>
<p>The colleagues of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus, in order to support the soldiers defending the territory in Suiyuan, have established a labor army committee with fellows of the two roads. Since the fundraising began, colleagues have enthusiastically donated, and a large sum of money has been accumulated. On the 18th, they first sent 10,000 yuan, which was remitted to Xi'an by the Bank of China, to be handed over to Chairman Jiang and Deputy Chairman Yan, who will then forward it to the soldiers on the front lines. They also sent a telegram of condolence. The original telegram reads: "(1) To Chairman Jiang of the Taiyuan Pacification Office in Shanxi, I am exploring: The invasion of the pseudo-bandits in Sui has shocked the country, and expelling the bandits outside the country is the only way to ensure the integrity of the territory. You have been working hard day and night to establish the national policy. Now, the soldiers on the front lines are loyally resisting the enemy, enduring hardships and remaining steadfast. All the colleagues of this road are willing to be the backing, and in addition to first donating a month's salary of 10,000 yuan, which will be remitted to Director Yan to be transferred to Chairman Fu, we hereby submit this telegram to express our condolences to the soldiers on the front lines and our love for the Party and the country."

<p>Shanghai, Reuters, 18th - News from Beiping stated that Madame Song Meiling, wife of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, is planning to launch a fundraising campaign to aid women and children suffering in the Spanish Civil War. Local authorities today specifically denied this, saying that while Madame Chiang deeply sympathizes with the sufferers of the Spanish Civil War, she believes that there are many urgent problems in China today, so she has no time or resources to engage in fundraising to aid Spanish women and children.</p>

<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce and Other Organizations Host a Banquet for the Nanyang (Southeast Asia) Inspection Group Yesterday, Lin Kanghou and Five Others Presiding with Utmost Cordiality, Expected to Report to the Ministry of Industry in Nanjing After the Holidays</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 6 PM, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the China National Products Promotion Association, the National Products Movement Federation, the China General Federation of Industry, and the Joint Association of Machine-Made National Products Factories held a banquet at the Bankers' Association on Hong Kong Road to welcome the Nanyang Inspection Group. Attendees included Wang Xiaolai, Cai Shengbai, Huang Renzhi, Gao Shiheng, Xu Xiaochu, Lu Zhixue, Hu Xiyuan, Pan Yangyao, Lin Kanghou, Wang Xingyao, Ren Shigang, Hu Shicheng, Fang Jianyue, and more than fifty others. Lin Kanghou, Ren Xiaoxiang, Lu Zhixue, Cai Shengbai, Wang Xingyao, and Hu Xiyuan formed the presidium.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>During the banquet, Chairman Lin Kanghou said, "Today, these six organizations are holding this meeting here to welcome the return of the Nanyang Commercial Inspection Group. The Nanyang Inspection Group departed in mid-July, traveling throughout Nanyang. Although the emotions of overseas Chinese toward the motherland vary from place to place, I believe that if groups like this travel there from time to time to promote [China], considerable results will be obtained. In order to commend you all for your efforts on behalf of the country, we have prepared a simple meal. Please give us your guidance freely."</p>
<p>Mr. Wang's Speech</p>
<p>Next, Wang Xiaolai said, "When you left the country, both domestic and foreign affairs were at an extremely difficult stage. Today, upon your return, the domestic situation is somewhat gratifying. Generally speaking, the structure of a country consists of no more than three elements: (1) land, (2) people, and (3) resources. In the past, the so-called Siam Inspection Group only sent me to promote [China]. This time, your group went to promote in person with talent and goods. This is a new initiative. I saw in the group leader's report that the Nanyang people had doubts about Chinese goods, thinking that China did not produce national goods. Now, this has given the local people a deep understanding, which is a remarkable achievement. I hope that groups like this will be sent abroad from time to time to promote [China] extensively. We deeply know that effort can make a career flourish. With effort, the problems of trade surplus/deficit and the economy can be easily solved."</p>
<p>Group Leader's Report</p>
<p>Gao Shiheng, leader of the Nanyang Inspection Group, reported, "People in the country are paying close attention to the results of the Nanyang Commercial Inspection Group because, although there is a history of trade between China and Nanyang for hundreds of years, in the past, it was all individual operations, with very few group dispatches. Therefore, there is a great gap between them. Before the war, the status of overseas Chinese was solid and their industries developed. After the end of the European war, countries around the world scrambled for markets, and Nanyang became the end point for industrial products. In particular, a certain country dumped its goods with all its might, occupying the market completely in ten years. The status of our overseas Chinese has been taken away as a result. Even the Europeans of the suzerain states have lost their color. Today, overseas Chinese are pained by the crisis of the motherland and are eager to find a way out for national goods. We know that most of the overseas Chinese in Nanyang are merchants, whether they are importers, wholesalers, or retailers. The purpose of merchants is to sell and make profits. Of course, everyone has the concept of loving the country, but the responsibility of supplying goods, and whether the price can compete in the market, depends entirely on the industrial circles of the motherland. Nanyang has a consumption of 120 million people, and overseas Chinese account for 6 million, accounting for 5% of the total population. To the overseas Chinese, we can say that they love the country and should be persuaded to use national goods. In the eyes of the indigenous people, there are no national boundaries. They only seek cheap and good quality goods. Overseas Chinese stores are intermediaries for consumers, so they cannot help but find ways for them. Who does not have a motherland? Who does not love the country? If national goods can compete in the international market, then overseas Chinese merchants will naturally be happy to promote them and will be the best promoters. Therefore, whether national goods can be promoted in Nanyang depends on whether the domestic industrial circles have the ability to strive. Speaking of the progress of our country's industry, in the past five years, with the rise of industry and emerging industries, there is an urgent need to find a way out to foreign countries. At the same time, from the national economic point of view, the huge annual trade surplus and overseas trade are the only means to offset the trade deficit. The industries in Europe and America are developed, and we have little room to insert ourselves. Only Nanyang is an agricultural country, which needs the import of industrial products and has durable consumption characteristics. We already have overseas Chinese as pioneers, which is an excellent condition that any country seeks but cannot obtain. Therefore, our country should not try to expand overseas trade if it has no plans to. If it wants to find a way out, there is no other way but to go to Nanyang. This is what we deeply believe after returning from Nanyang. In order to clarify the above principles, I will explain them separately.</p>
<p>The position occupied by overseas Chinese in Nanyang: The so-called Nanyang includes the Philippine Islands of the United States, the Dutch East Indies, British Malaya and Borneo, British Burma, French Vietnam, and Siam and Timor. Of the above territories, except for Siam, which is an independent country, the rest are colonies of white people. The total population of Nanyang is 124,370,000, of which overseas Chinese account for 6,155,000, accounting for 5% of the total. By region, the United States-controlled Philippines has a total population of 13,630,000, of which overseas Chinese account for 110,000. The Dutch East Indies has a total population of 60,720,000, of which overseas Chinese account for 1,233,000. British Malaya has 4,410,000 people, of which overseas Chinese account for 1,648,000. British Burma has 13,121,000 people, of which overseas Chinese account for 193,000. French Vietnam has a population of 19,630,000, of which overseas Chinese account for 391,000. Siam has a population of 12,740,000, of which overseas Chinese account for 2,500,000. However, the distribution of overseas Chinese is in various important cities, including 407,000 in Singapore, 118,000 in Penang, 204,000 in Selangor (Kuala Lumpur), 307,000 in Perak (Ipoh), 78,000 in Batavia, 38,000 in Surabaya, 27,000 in Semarang, 27,000 in Medan, 400,000 in Bangkok, and 122,000 in Saigon. This huge population is distributed throughout Nanyang. Every time we arrived in a place, we felt as if we were in China, almost forgetting that we were in a foreign country. Great, my country's overseas Chinese!</p>
<p>The businesses operated by overseas Chinese: The businesses operated by overseas Chinese in various places vary according to the environment and industry. British Malaya, with Singapore as its center, is a free port with a sparse population and welcomes immigrants. I do not know how many tens of millions of our overseas Chinese have started their families by engaging in tin mining and rubber. Although it has been affected by the depression since 1932, it is gradually recovering. Almost all of the stores in the big cities are established by overseas Chinese because the indigenous people are not good at doing business. For labor, except for public works and projects of the government, which are handled by Indian immigrants, our overseas Chinese account for the majority. The policy of the Dutch East Indies is obviously different from that of the British. For entry, a head tax of 150 guilders, equivalent to 280 yuan in national currency, must be paid. How can a middle-class family afford it? Therefore, the number of our country's immigrants has decreased. The largest business of our overseas Chinese in the Dutch territories is sugar, while others are wholesalers (importers are in the hands of Europeans) and retailers. Most of the laborers are engaged in mining and planting. Overseas Chinese in the United States-controlled Philippines occupy a rather high position, with large-scale operations such as banks and timber companies. According to the 1932 statistics of the Philippine Department of Agriculture and Commerce, the total investment of overseas Chinese in the Philippines is as high as 482,000,313 pesos. Retailers, such as Chinese grocery stores, what Filipinos call "Yeya" stores, are almost all in the hands of our overseas Chinese. However, as the level of Filipinos rises day by day, there are often proposals in the parliament that are unfavorable to the Chinese. This is the thorny road ahead. Overseas Chinese in Siam mainly engage in rice business. The so-called "fire sound" refers to rice mills, which are almost all in the hands of overseas Chinese. Since rice is Siam's only lifeline, the relationship with overseas Chinese can be known. The Siamese are not good at doing business. All shops are owned by overseas Chinese, and most of the Siamese government personnel have Chinese blood. Whether in big cities or small towns, it is the world of the Chinese. The position in the economy is self-evident. In French Vietnam, the economic power of overseas Chinese is gradually collapsing. The French adopt an absolute protection policy, excluding foreign goods. Even Japanese goods shake their heads. Before 1927, China and Vietnam had a special treaty. When the old treaty expired, the new one was established, and those who operated national goods completely failed. Only the rice industry is still in the hands of overseas Chinese, which can barely be maintained. In general, the position of overseas Chinese overseas is due to: 1. The local government's efforts to protect the interests of the indigenous people; 2. The indigenous people's knowledge is increasing day by day and there is a trend of self-reliance; 3. People from a certain country are constantly expanding their business territory. Therefore, in addition to self-reliance, our overseas Chinese rely entirely on a strong government as their backing, which is what overseas Chinese are eager for today.</p>
<p>The educational situation of overseas Chinese: Overseas Chinese have education. Since Kang Youwei advocated it in Nanyang, schools have been established. In the past ten years, there has been a trend of progress. Everywhere the inspection group went, it felt that the prevalence of the national language was even more widespread than in the country, which is all thanks to the schools. The students are more lively, healthy, and simple than students in the country. However, the education of overseas Chinese depends on others. According to the conclusions of the group's secretary, education expert Yang Chonggao, on the education in various territories, the Philippines has double education, that is, in the morning, English classes of any kind must be taken, and in the afternoon, Chinese classes must be taken. The Dutch East Indies has restricted education. Any teaching materials that belong to patriotic ideology are not allowed at all. The degree of restriction is incomparable. It is often heard that schools are sealed off and teachers are deported. British Malaya has supervised education, takes liberalism, and supervises it. It has not been heard that overseas Chinese can read the books of the motherland and oppose Britain. This is also the cleverness of the British. Siam has assimilation education, that is, every student must read Siamese, and the teacher must know Siamese, the purpose of which is to assimilate into Siam. Therefore, due to various reasons, the prevalence and effectiveness of education should be attributed to Malaya. Overseas Chinese are very willing to send their children back to the motherland to seek advanced studies, but they hope that there will be strictly managed schools in the country that are suitable for the character of overseas Chinese. Overseas Chinese families are deeply uneasy about the laissez-faire of their children, so the responsibility of protection depends on the school authorities.</p>
<p>The concept of overseas Chinese about the motherland: Overseas Chinese who come from the motherland are more aware of the domestic situation. Overseas students have no thoughts of national difficulties, and even assimilate to the local people or worship the suzerain country. In the past ten years, exchanges between China and Nanyang have become more frequent, and education has become more developed, increasing the concept of patriotism. Our only leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's hard work for the country gives them a good impression. In the past, there were a small number of newspapers that opposed the central government's arguments, but now they have changed their style and fully support their views. In today's China, in the current extremely dangerous situation, only the people of the whole country, with one heart and one mind, can support the leader and protect the country. Their patriotic feelings have changed from impetuousness to calmness. This can be proved by the recent donation of money to buy airplanes to wish Chairman Chiang Kai-shek a long life. Therefore, the recent overseas Chinese have shifted their psychology and returned to the motherland. During this inspection group's national goods exhibition in various places, many participants were surprised and expressed surprise, thinking that they just realized that the motherland also has industry, which gave them a good impression. We hope that the government can guide them according to the situation. Overseas Chinese are truly a strong fortress of the motherland. The past and present of consulates in various places: Consulates are commercial officials, and in fact, they should establish close contact with the business community in order to show their true function. During this inspection group's travels, all the personnel of the consulates were mobilized to cooperate, which gave the inspection group a lot of convenience. This proves the progress of our foreign consulates. According to overseas Chinese, in the past, consulates only had a signboard. Now, our consulates can seek the happiness of overseas Chinese. Given the national strength of our country and the funding of the consulates, there are problems. It all depends on the ability of the authorities to be active. We hope to contact the consulates at any time in the future to seek the development of international trade. We also express our sincere gratitude to the consulates for their struggle and efforts.</p>
<p>An analysis of the Nanyang commercial market: The years before and after the war were the golden age of the Nanyang market. After the depression spread around the world, Nanyang was no exception. Since 1931, the fall in the price of rubber and tin has had a major impact on Nanyang commerce. Many overseas Chinese shops have gone bankrupt as a result. Since 1935, there has been a gradual recovery. The indigenous people do not know how to do business. In the past, overseas Chinese braved the wind and rain and built a great commercial foundation by relying on the national nature of enduring hardship and hard work. Today, the situation is different, and competition from all sides is fierce. If overseas Chinese do not consciously strive, I am afraid that the legacy of their ancestors will disappear. Regarding the Nanyang market, we can say separately: (1) The Philippines is a protectorate of the United States. All American goods are imported with tax-free privileges, but Japanese goods compete fiercely, and their prices are lower than the tax-free American goods. Not only the United States is impressed, but other countries will retreat. National goods, except for cotton textiles and food, have not seen development. China is in a trade surplus with the Philippines. (2) The Dutch East Indies is indeed a good market. Seeing the dumping of foreign goods, the goods of its mother country are lagging behind. Therefore, since 1934, it has implemented controlled trade and restricted the import of foreign goods. Except for those who have commercial agreements with the Netherlands to exchange goods, which are allowed to be imported within the restrictions, other countries are restricted. Chinese goods are also on the list of restrictions. Japan has negotiated with the Dutch East Indies several times to allocate the market, but it has not been successful. (3) Malaya is a free port, and its abundant production creates a situation of great consumption. Japanese goods compete fiercely, causing the cotton cloth market in Lancashire and Manchester, England, to be shaken. Therefore, there was a restriction on the import of cloth in 1934. According to general observations, it is feared that other goods may gradually be restricted. Chinese goods have a considerable sales volume due to the large number of overseas Chinese, but it is ultimately not as smooth as Japanese goods. (4) China is a country with a trade deficit with Siam because it buys a large amount of Siamese rice every year. Siam is still an agricultural country and needs a large number of industrial products. The treatment of all countries is equal. Chinese goods in Siam are rare. It is a pity that national goods cannot be sold well in a country with one-fifth of overseas Chinese. In fact, there is a great opportunity for promotion. (5) French Vietnam single-mindedly protects the policy of French goods. The high tariffs are unmatched in the world. In addition to the regular tax, various additional taxes are added. Any country in Vietnam is afraid that there will be little hope for development. This is the general market in various places in Nanyang.</p>
<p>The status of national goods in Nanyang: National goods can be said to have no status in Nanyang. In fact, after the investigation by the inspection group and the research methods of overseas Chinese merchants, it was discovered that there are opportunities to promote national goods in Nanyang. In the past, the Chinese industrial and commercial circles only said that there was no hope in Nanyang. They did not study the cause of the disease, nor did they try to promote it. They only followed what others said. Among the exhibits of the 37 factories carried by the inspection group, many goods had never been introduced to Nanyang, but in fact, they could be promoted. How many new industries are there in China? Nanyang merchants do not understand the situation in China, and Chinese factories do not advance to Nanyang, so how can they be expected to develop? From the perspective of international trade, this is not a simple matter. It must have considerable experience and knowledge to be successful. The times are also different from each other. One cannot sell in the past, or one can sell now. It all depends on how we work hard.</p>
<p>What should the Chinese industrial community do in the future? If the Chinese industrial community wants to occupy a place in Nanyang in the future, it should have at least three conditions: 1. The value can join the international competitive market. In other words, we must reduce costs to make the price cheap. 2. The style should be suitable for local sales, that is, it must meet the tastes of the indigenous people in various places. All decorations and quality must be suitable for the needs of the environment. 3. There must be a whole plan, or a whole group of the same industry, which can not only save expenses, but also increase strength, and can carry out various public needs work and reports. In addition, there are two points that should be requested from the government: 1. Open up the Nanyang route. We know that the shipping business is bound to lose money, but it is better to seek self-transfer than to pay huge freight to foreigners. No matter how the shipping company loses money, the source of profit will not overflow. 2. Set up banks in various places. The establishment of the Bank of China in Singapore gave overseas Chinese a good impression. I hope it can spread throughout Nanyang. At the same time, please reduce interest rates and facilitate the exchange of bills. Then, under the cooperation of officials and businessmen, Nanyang trade will not be difficult to develop day by day. In addition to going to Guangdong and Fujian, overseas Chinese in Nanyang do not fully understand other aspects, thinking that Nanyang is located in the tropics and must be as hot as fire, and that the fish, tigers, jackals are terrible, which gives people a deep impression. In fact, the climate in Nanyang is at most 95 degrees and at least 72 degrees, averaging between 80 degrees, which is more comfortable than Shanghai in summer. It is green in all seasons, with mountains and seas. It is truly a paradise in the world. Except for undeveloped places, there are fish, tigers, and leopards, it is truly a place to live and work in peace, where one does not pick up lost property, and one does not close the door at night. The good politics and security are truly admirable. The most troublesome thing for Chinese people going to Nanyang is the difficulty of entry procedures. This point can be solved by the group's position to find a way to solve it, so that it can be handled properly, and there is no difficulty. Finally, I only hope that this Nanyang inspection group has done a seeding job, and I hope that the Chinese people will give guidance, and I hope that there will be closer contact between our country and Nanyang, then the harvest will surely be predictable. Finally, my deepest feeling during this trip to Nanyang is that all parts of Nanyang, except Siam, are conquered and subjugated nations. The methods of the colonial governments treat them, I am afraid that these nations will never have the opportunity to revive. Therefore, at important moments, the people must do their best to protect the country. After the country is subjugated, whether rich or poor, they will be cattle and horses. Today's China, although it has not yet reached this critical juncture, I have witnessed the lessons of various subjugated nations, and today's leaders are all the most powerful industrial and commercial organizations in Shanghai, which also represents the will of the entire industrial and commercial community. In the current situation, there are only two most important points that should be paid attention to: 1. Consistently step up the support for our only leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and the whole country should rise to save the country under his leadership. 2. Please quickly set up various public groups to provide vigorous assistance to General Fu Zuoyi, who defended the soil and fought the war in Suiyuan (Eastern Inner Mongolia).</p>
<h3>Workers at Japanese-owned Naigaiwata Cotton Mills No. 5, 6, and 7 Responded to the Strike Yesterday, Toyota No. 2 Mill Vandalism Incident, Funatsu Went to Various Mills for Investigation Yesterday, Workers Petitioned to Dissuade Dispersal</h3>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reported that after the Toyota No. 2 Mill was vandalized, the factory immediately reported the situation to the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai. The Consul General Wakisugi, Chief Consul Fukui, and Deputy Consul Terasaki discussed the matter at the meeting room on the third floor of Huangpu Road at 10 AM yesterday.</p>
<p>Funatsu Investigates Various Mills</p>
<p>Funatsu Tatsichiro, chairman of the Japanese Textile Industry Association in China, went to Toyota Nos. 1 and 2, and Naigaiwata Nos. 1, 2, 6, and 7 at 10 AM yesterday to investigate the labor unrest. He was received by Nishikawa, the head of Toyota, and Katsuta Shunji, the head of Naigaiwata. He then accompanied the Toyota No. 2 Mill to inspect the vandalized parts of the factory and its losses, which ended at 10:30 AM. The factory also took photos of the vandalized items for future reference.</p>
<p>Mills Hold Meeting Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>Yesterday at 3 PM, the Japanese Textile Industry Association in China convened a joint meeting of all Japanese-owned yarn mills in Shanghai at the Japanese Club on Peng Road. Sixteen people, including the heads and deputy heads of various mills, attended. Chairman Funatsu reported on the investigation of the labor unrest at Toyota and Naigaiwata Mills. Then, Nishikawa, the head of Toyota, stood up to report on the vandalism and losses at No. 2 Mill. They then discussed countermeasures until they dispersed at about 5:30 PM. As for the labor unrest at Naigaiwata Yarn Mill, at 10 AM yesterday, Nakano Kaheiji, director of the personnel section of the factory's writing room, invited the foremen of various departments and teams of Nos. 2, 5, 6, and 7 Mills to discuss solutions.</p>
<p>Investigation of Vandalism at No. 2 Mill</p>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency reporter's investigation of the vandalism at Toyota No. 2 Mill, in addition to the fact that most of the glass windows in the workshop were damaged, the rest was intact. The writing room, dining room, staff dormitory, chairs, tables, and other debris in the factory were slightly vandalized. The motor machines in the workshop were not damaged. Only nine wooden reeling cars were destroyed, and several spindle heads in the weaving room were broken. The Social Affairs Bureau and the Public Security Bureau have both sent personnel to investigate the losses of the Toyota factory and the details of the conflict at that time.</p>
<p>Current Status of Strikes at Various Mills</p>
<p>At Japanese-owned Toyota No. 1 Mill on Zhongshan Road, there are 900 male workers and 2,400 female workers. At No. 2 Mill, there are 300 male workers and 1,000 female workers. The strike continued yesterday morning. At 6 AM yesterday, 400 workers from No. 6 Mill of the Japanese-owned Naigaiwata Textile Department on Yichang Road and 320 workers from No. 7 Mill (except for the 150 or so workers from the weaving department of No. 7 Mill, who continued to work as usual) and 800 to 900 workers from the fine yarn room of No. 5 Mill on West Suzhou River Road all left the factory and went on strike. Also, at the weaving department of No. 1 Mill of Naigaiwata on Robison Road, the daytime workers started work as usual. Only part of the weaving department of No. 2 Mill started work. When the Dagong News Agency reporter drove to investigate at 5:30 PM yesterday evening, hundreds of male and female workers from Naigaiwata Nos. 1 and 2 Mills entered the factory to work in an orderly manner. However, in front of the new and old Toyota Mills on Zhongshan Road, Japanese marines with guns were stationed, and two armored vehicles were parked along the road. The Caojiadu Branch of the Public Security Bureau also dispatched police posts to provide strict protection. Both factory gates were posted with "Temporary Closure" notices.</p>
<p>Workers Petition to Dissuade Dispersal</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 8 AM, all the striking workers sent more than 60 representatives, holding a white cloth flag with the words "Toyota Yarn Mill Petition Delegation" written on it, to gather along Zhongshan Road. They marched in formation to the Municipal Government to petition. When they passed near Tanziwan on Zhongshan Road, Liao Jiongran, the director of the Xin'yue Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and Liang Fuchu, the director of the Zhabei Branch, personally persuaded the worker representatives to convey the workers' petition to the Municipal Government. All the petition delegates accepted the advice and dispersed.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Workers' Union Petitions the Ministry of Finance for an Extension of the Liquidation of the Loan Association</h3>
<p>The United Association of Citizens of the First Special District, petitions the Ministry of Finance, stating that it is petitioning for approval to extend the liquidation of the Industry and Commerce Loan Committee. In recent years, disasters have been frequent, the national economy has declined, and the encroachment of international monetary policies has intensified, leading to financial exhaustion and economic depression. Therefore, the Ministry implemented a new monetary policy last year to stem the tide. Previously, the Industry and Commerce Loan Committee was re-established in this city to facilitate regulation. Since its establishment, various industries and businesses have benefited greatly. However, upon reading reports recently, the Industry and Commerce Loan Committee is about to be liquidated. All sectors have expressed deep concern upon hearing this news. Considering that although this year's harvests in various regions are promising, and the national economy may be somewhat improved, the years of hardship have depleted the vitality, and a sudden turnaround is difficult to achieve in the short term. Regulatory assistance is still needed. Therefore, the Association has decided at its eighth standing committee meeting to petition the authorities to approve an extension of the liquidation of the Industry and Commerce Loan Committee in order to maintain the market. It is reasonable to petition the Ministry to consider the current difficulties and grant an extension of the liquidation to facilitate regulation and benefit industry and commerce. This is truly in the public interest.</p>
<h3>The Public Works Department Discusses Internal Austerity Issues, No Conclusion Reached Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Board of Directors of the Public Works Department held a meeting yesterday to discuss the issue of personnel reduction. The report of the Personnel Reduction Committee has also been submitted to the Board of Directors. After careful consideration by the directors, it was decided that the matter was of great importance and a special meeting would be convened next Wednesday to continue the discussion. Therefore, no conclusion was reached regarding the report of the Reduction Committee at yesterday's meeting.</p>

<h3>Latvian Independence Day: Latvian Nationals Celebrate Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday marked the 18th anniversary of the independence of the Republic of Latvia. Latvian nationals in this city celebrated with joy. Their consulate also held a reception to receive congratulations from guests. Latvia, after 700 years of foreign rule, regained its independence during the European War thanks to the efforts of the current President Ulmanis and Foreign Minister Meirovich. The new government was initially ruled by parliamentarians elected by the people, but soon political parties sprang up, eventually numbering as many as 27, leading to chaotic government affairs and the risk of national bankruptcy. On May 15, 1934, the current President Ulmanis, with the help of General Balodis of the Army, ordered the dissolution of the government and established a new government to implement a national unification program. Dr. Ulmanis personally took on the heavy responsibility, knowing the needs and aspirations of his people, and his efforts succeeded without bloodshed. Today, the country is peaceful, there are no unemployed, and every year thousands of foreign farmers and workers enter the country. Recently, a treaty of friendship was concluded with China.</p>

<h3>Chongming Compatriots in Shanghai Hold an Important Meeting to Discuss the Forced Purchase of Land in Qidong, Resolving to Strive for Justice from the Central Government and the Provincial Government</h3>
<p>Chongming County has two outer and inner sandbanks, where people mostly engage in farming and weaving. Since the implementation of separate governance in the 17th year of the Republic of China, the outer sandbank was designated as Qidong County. Chongming people have a considerable amount of land in the outer sandbank. Since the separation, the land tax has increased more than forty times, resulting in a heavy burden and great suffering. Recently, Qidong has also petitioned the Jiangsu Provincial Land Administration Bureau, proposing to forcibly purchase the land of Chongming people in Qidong at a price of only six to nine yuan per mu, and issue land price bonds with the rent collected, to be repaid in six years. The Chongming compatriots in Shanghai, considering the important matter of land administration and the need to protect property rights, held a meeting yesterday. More than one hundred people, including Zeng Zezhong, Bai Jinren, and others, attended. After discussion, it was unanimously decided to strive for justice from the Central Party Headquarters, the Executive Yuan, and the Provincial Government, and to reject the illegal proposal of Qidong.</p>
<h3>The County Judicial Criminal Court Allows Lawyers to Appear in Court: Shanghai Lawyers Association Submits Document to the Ministry of Judicial Administration</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association submitted a document to the Ministry of Judicial Administration yesterday, stating that it was submitting a petition to amend Article 7 of the Measures for Lawyers to Practice in County Judicial Courts in order to benefit criminal litigation cases. The letter from the Feng Huai Lawyers Association stated that Article 7 of the Measures for Lawyers to Practice in County Judicial Courts stipulates that in criminal cases where the county magistrate is not required to appear in court, lawyers are also not required to appear in court, according to Article 13 of the Supplementary Regulations on Litigation Handled by County Judicial Courts. Furthermore, Article 13 of the Supplementary Regulations on Litigation Handled by County Judicial Courts states that the county magistrate may not appear in court on the date of criminal case trials. It is evident that the rule that the county magistrate may not appear in court in criminal cases is an extremely arbitrary regulation. It does not mean that the county magistrate may not appear in court in certain criminal cases. In other words, the county magistrate may not appear in court in any criminal case. Judging from the county government's usual practices, the county magistrate has never been very serious about handling judicial matters. Even if there are active legal provisions requiring the county magistrate to appear in court to perform the duties of a prosecutor, the county magistrate appearing in court on the date of a criminal trial is an extremely rare occurrence. Since the county magistrate may not appear in court at all, and lawyers are also not required to appear in court, lawyers will never have the opportunity to appear in court on the date of a criminal trial. Lawyers handling criminal cases who appear in court to confront the prosecutor are performing the duty of defense. In criminal prosecution proceedings, the defender has deeper responsibilities than agents in other proceedings, and should not be treated the same. On the one hand, they protect the interests of the criminal defendant, and on the other hand, they promote the discovery of the truth. Therefore, current criminal laws and regulations even have mandatory provisions for the appointment of public defenders in criminal cases with heavier penalties. If the above measures are followed to restrict lawyers from appearing in court, it is tantamount to directly denying the defender system. This is clearly contrary to our country's recent legislative policies and the legislative examples of civilized countries in the East and West. The Association, seeing this, decided at a meeting of councilors to petition the Ministry of Judicial Administration to amend Article 7 of the Measures for Lawyers to Practice in County Judicial Courts and to request lawyers' associations in various places to strive for justice together. This was approved. The 236th joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees of the Association discussed and agreed that since the organization of the county judicial court does not allow lawyers to appear in court, for the sake of promoting the rule of law and legislative justice, lawyers should be allowed to appear in court in criminal litigation proceedings related to national public interest in order to protect the legal rights of criminal defendants and to promote the discovery of the truth. It was decided to submit a request to the Ministry for amendment. Therefore, it is urgently requested that the Ministry review and approve the amendment of Article 7 of the Measures for Lawyers to Practice in County Judicial Courts to allow lawyers to appear in court in criminal cases. This is in the public interest. Respectfully submitted to the Ministry of Judicial Administration.</p>
<h3>The Buddhist Association's Representative Assembly Closes Yesterday: Telegrams of Condolences to Chairman Chiang and the Soldiers in Suiyuan</h3>
<p>The Eighth National Representative Assembly of the Chinese Buddhist Association, originally scheduled to close the day before yesterday, was extended by half a day to yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM because there were important cases that had not been discussed. All proposals were decided by the meeting as follows: (1) The draft articles of the general rules for the organization of various branch associations were resolved and passed. Cases 1 to 12 were all handed over to the board of directors. Case 13, the budget for the 26th year of the Republic of China, was resolved and passed. (14) A case to send telegrams of condolence to Chairman Chiang and the soldiers in Suiyuan in the name of the Assembly was resolved and passed. Case 15 should not be discussed. Case 16 was also handed over to the board of directors.</p>
<p>The telegram of condolence to Chiang Kai-shek read as follows: "Respectfully addressed to Chairman Chiang, Taiyuan Exploration. You, sir, have devoted yourself to the Party and the country, and have taken on difficult tasks. As the disaster of the invaders deepens, your virtuous efforts are admired. This Association, on behalf of Buddhists across the country, extends our condolences. We humbly ask for your consideration. The National Buddhist Representative Assembly of the Chinese Buddhist Association bows respectfully." (2) To Guihua Fu Niuxi and forwarded to the soldiers at the front: "You, sirs, are defending our territory, resisting aggression, and saving the country with loyalty, righteousness, diligence, and hard work. The world admires you. This Association, on behalf of Buddhists across the country, extends our condolences." The rest is omitted.</p>
<p>Board of Directors Meeting: The Association held a board of directors meeting immediately after the closing of the Assembly. Those present included Qu Wenliu, Guan Jiongzhi, Huang Hanzhi, Dabi, etc. The various proposals submitted by the Assembly were decided to be handled by the Standing Committee. In addition, the resignation of the chairman of the board, Yuan Ying, was passed and a motion to retain him was approved. The various representatives who came to Shanghai to participate this time are scheduled to return today.</p>
<h3>Da Da and Da Tong Launch a Shanghai-Nantong Express Short-Haul Ferry: Da Zhi and Da He Ferries Operate in Rotation, Starting Today and Arriving the Same Evening</h3>
<p>The Da Da Shipping Company and the Da Tong Shipping Company of the Tongyang Line, considering the short days of winter and the current of the water, every time the downstream ferries arrive in Nantong, they arrive late at night at the earliest, and as late as the next morning at the latest. Passengers feel very inconvenient getting on and off, and the bitter north wind is painful. The two companies, serving the shipping industry, should adapt to the times in order to benefit travelers. Therefore, it has been tentatively decided to increase the number of express short-haul ferries from November 19th, transferring the Da Da Company's Da He ferry (1,001 gross tons, 604 net tons) and the Da Tong Company's Zhi Da ferry (1,366 gross tons, 822 net tons), etc., two ships, to operate in rotation, departing from Shanghai and passing through Langshan Port, Yaogang Ren Port, Tianshenggang, Xinshenggang, Zhanghuanggang, and up to Xingang. Shanghai and Tianshenggang both depart at noon and arrive the same evening, barring wind and rain. A trial run will be conducted for one month first.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Public Buses Change to Colored Signs to Indicate Route Names</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Public Bus Company, considering that many buses turn around at the Baoshan Road Terminal, although there are route name signs on the front of the bus and next to the door, passengers often get on the wrong bus due to literacy issues. Now, in order to facilitate universal identification, the Company has added colored magnetic signs to the front left side of each public bus, so that passengers can tell which route the bus is running on from hundreds of yards away. Route 1A buses use black and white, Route 1B buses use black and yellow, Route 3 is red, Route 4 is yellow, Route 5 is green, and Route 6 is white. The small route signs at each stop will also be changed to the above colors. Also, these explanatory tables are affixed to each stop sign to inform the public. This will be implemented on the 20th of this month.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Anti-Opium Committee's Open Letter to Citizens on Anti-Drug Propaganda</h3>
<p>Dear Citizens,</p>
<p>Today is the tenth day of the Municipal Anti-Drug Propaganda Week. Starting next year, all compatriots who are addicted to drugs, if they do not quit quickly, will be executed if caught by the government. The Committee takes this opportunity to give the final warning, hoping that drug addicts will come to their senses.</p>
<p>Since the end of the Qing Dynasty and up to the Republic of China, as a result of the warlord authorities' implementation of an incomplete anti-opium policy, in addition to the continued rampant opium scourge, various opium substitutes with different names were also discovered, such as Shangqiang Anti-Smoking Pills, Anti-Drug Golden Elixirs, Medicinal Injections, and all kinds of pleasant-sounding terms. The general public, misled by propaganda and weak-willed, found that not only was their opium addiction not removed, but their drug addiction was deepened. Therefore, they would be on the verge of death if they did not take this kind of potent drug. If they were given opium, they would not be able to satisfy their addiction. Thus, on the surface, it seemed that the number of people smoking opium had decreased, and the anti-opium policy had achieved considerable results. In reality, the drug scourge replaced a part of the opium scourge, like a wolf being kept out of the front door, but a tiger entering through the back door, becoming more and more serious.</p>
<p>Therefore, since the establishment of the National Government in the 16th year of the Republic of China, having silently observed the environment and deeply understood the shortcomings, it was decided that the anti-opium campaign should continue, and at the same time, all efforts should be devoted to anti-drug efforts. A gradual policy was adopted for anti-opium, with the aim of completely eradicating it in six years, while an intensive policy was adopted for anti-drug, with the aim of eradicating it in two years. Therefore, from January 1st of the 26th year of the Republic of China, when the two-year eradication period expires, those who manufacture, transport, sell, or consume red pills and all kinds of potent drugs will be sentenced to death.</p>
<p>Speaking of potent drugs, what exactly are they, and what is the situation? Here, there should be a general explanation for our beloved citizens. According to the Anti-Drug Punishment Regulations, the so-called potent drugs refer to "morphine," "cocaine," "heroin," "red pills," and other compounds. We may have heard this phrase, "This person is injecting morphine." Injecting morphine means that when the drug addiction flares up and the person is crying and sniveling, they dissolve morphine powder in water and use a tube-like needle to suck in the toxic water and then pierce it into the skin to let the toxic liquid flow into the blood vessels. In that instant, the whole body is anesthetized, and this is what is called "getting high." Some people also say, "This person is firing a high-altitude gun." A high-altitude gun is made by taking a cigarette and removing part of the tobacco at the head, then putting the toxic powder—heroin—on the head of the cigarette and lighting it to smoke. In one breath, the toxic liquid is inhaled into the abdomen. This procedure is the most convenient, and the person looks up and stares, as if aiming at something. Smoking red pills and other colored pills is even more prevalent among the lower classes in Jiangsu and Zhejiang and in several provinces in the north. These red pills are made by mixing flour, coffee, sugar, and other ingredients, and the main components are morphine and cocaine. Smoking these potent drugs is much simpler and more convenient than smoking opium, and it is easier to avoid suspicion. It is not as troublesome as smoking opium. However, once addicted, the poisoning is deep, and the person becomes emaciated. Not only is it not easy to quit, but after one or two years, this person is bound to die.</p>
<p>Now the government has stipulated that from the 26th year of the Republic of China, those who manufacture or transport drugs, those who sell or possess drugs with the intention of selling them, those who intend to profit by injecting morphine for others, or those who set up places for people to consume drugs, and those who personally consume various potent drugs, will all be sentenced to death. If we do not study carefully, we may think that the government is punishing these people too severely and should be lenient. In fact, if these people have become addicted to drugs and do not resolve to quit, even if the government does not pay attention or punish them, these people will also die of poisoning within one or two years. Therefore, shooting these people is without pity and not worth sympathizing with. As for those who manufacture, transport, and sell drugs, their crime is even greater than that of drug addicts. This is truly no different from killing with a knife. These people are more dangerous and treacherous than robbers. Therefore, shooting these people is even more justified. Therefore, under these circumstances, the government's method of cutting the Gordian knot with a sharp knife and the harsh realities of using heavy punishment in chaotic times should be supported and sympathized with. It is hoped that drug addicts will quickly quit under the deterrent of killing one to warn a hundred, and that those who engage in drug trafficking will quickly lay down their butcher knives and save themselves and others.</p>
<p>Finally, we want to say that it is an unwavering fact that the government has been strictly and conscientiously implementing this anti-opium and anti-drug policy since it decided on it. There has never been any pretense, and it will not stop until the six-year eradication of opium and the two-year eradication of drugs are achieved. Of course, the government losing and executing citizens is a great loss, but for citizens who have no ambition and are willing to degenerate, if they cannot be awakened by persuasion, they can only be sacrificed without compassion or a way to avoid it. Therefore, it is hoped that enlightened people will no longer harbor a wait-and-see attitude or a fluke mentality, and will quickly and voluntarily go to the hospital to quit. As for those who manufacture, transport, and sell drugs, they should quickly change their ways and become a new, bright, free citizen from the 26th year of the Republic of China. What could be more joyful?</p>

Now, the Ministry of Finance's Reply No. 31855 states that the charcoal-fired stoves produced by Zhongming Machinery Manufacturing Company are a new invention and deserve promotion and incentives. A three-year exemption from transit tax should be granted, from November 11 of this year to November 10 of the 28th year [of the Republic].

<h3>Preparing for the Shanghai Municipal Horticultural Exhibition</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau is preparing for the third Horticultural Exhibition. President Pan Gongzhan and Director of Preparations Bao Bodu are actively working on the arrangements. It has been decided to hold the exhibition for three days, from the 20th to the 22nd of this month, at the Donggou Agricultural and Forestry Farm (formerly known as the Garden Farm) in Pudong, so that visitors can fully enjoy the scenery of nature. The exhibits collected include a large number of rare and famous chrysanthemums, as well as various exotic horticultural flowers, trees, fruits, vegetables, and various products, tools, medicines, and books related to horticulture, all of which can be displayed. A circular has been sent to exhibitors, requesting them to transport their exhibits to the Lundu Pier on the Bund of Beijing Road between 8:00 AM and 4:00 PM on the 17th and 18th, where the committee will assign personnel for inventory. An agreement has been reached with the Shanghai Ferry Company to issue round-trip tickets at a 40% discount and one-way tickets at a 30% discount. These tickets will be distributed to exhibitors and personnel related to the Horticultural Society for preferential treatment. To encourage the exhibitors' painstaking research, letters have been sent to various sectors soliciting prizes for the selection committee to award. Since yesterday and the day before, exhibits have been arriving one after another, and the arrangements have been properly made. A pine and cypress archway has been erected at the main entrance, with the words "Shanghai Municipal Horticultural Exhibition" made of cotton. In the western part of the exhibition site, there is a small river with avenues along the river, planted with tower cypress and weeping willows, leading directly to a small exit. There is a thatched pavilion on the mountain for visitors to rest. The second entrance to the exhibition site is in the middle section of the road, with a small bridge of blue waves and red railings outside the gate, adding a unique sense of seclusion. In the scenic garden at the rear, a thatched cottage suitable for displaying horticultural products has been specially built. The beams inside the cottage are painted with vermilion paint and equipped with electric lights to create an interesting contrast with the colors of the rare chrysanthemums and various flowers and trees. The outside of the cottage is covered with lawn, creating a flat green area for sitting and lying down. The surrounding hills and ridges undulate, the mountains stretch, the streams meander, and the shadows of the trees are staggered, forming a defensive posture for the cottage. There are also several scenic bridges in the field, which are simple and elegant. It is expected that this annual garden exhibition will be even more spectacular this year.</p>
<h3>Municipal Guoshu Hall Holds Guoshu Performance</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Guoshu Hall is actively promoting guoshu (Chinese martial arts) and improving public health, with remarkable results.

<h3>Medical and Health Services of the Public Concession Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association</h3>
<p>The Public Concession Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association, recognizing the economic difficulties faced by its members, and the fact that illness often leaves them unable to afford medical treatment, greatly affecting their health and well-being, and that delays in treatment often lead to death, established at its inception in 1934, that medical assistance was the most pressing need of the members. The association immediately began preparing to establish clinics to meet urgent needs and later established a hospital to benefit patients. At the same time, it continued to provide health guidance, mobile nursing, vaccinations, health campaigns, and other important health initiatives. Members who are unable to pull rickshaws due to illness are given rice subsidies by the association to ensure that their families are not affected. A detailed description is provided below.</p>
<p>Medical Overview</p>
<p>The association currently has five clinics located in the respective association offices, with Chinese and Western doctors providing treatment separately. Chinese and Western medicines are also provided by the association. The association also operates its own hospital on Maigen Road, equipped with a pathology laboratory, surgical operating room, patient bathroom, and disinfection facilities. The hospital has a total of 28 beds, and all food and meals for inpatients are provided by the hospital. Members with serious illnesses that cannot be treated in the hospital are transferred to specialized hospitals for treatment at the association's expense. Recognizing that members' lifestyles and habits are often unhygienic due to their circumstances, the association provides health guidance to advise members and their families to pay attention to hygiene. If a member is too ill to visit a clinic, a doctor will visit their home for treatment, and mobile nurses will provide care, paying attention to their needs for assistance and providing support. Other preventive vaccinations, childbirth guidance, and other services are also provided, which are greatly appreciated by the members.</p>
<p>Organizational Structure</p>
<p>The board of directors appointed Wang Zhiren, Dr. Mai, Dr. Fu Hou Shao'an, He Wushan, and Tong Xingmen to form a medical committee, with Wang Zhiren serving as chairman. All measures are proposed to the board of directors by the committee for implementation. Currently, there are seven Western doctors, one Chinese doctor, three health counselors and mobile nurses, one childbirth instructor, and seventeen male and female nurses.</p>
<p>Service Statistics</p>
<p>According to the association's statistics, from December 1934 to the end of September this year, the number of visits by members and their families to the various clinics and hospitals for medical treatment totaled 321,534, including 268,834 visits to Western doctors, 6,476 visits to Chinese doctors, 7,179 visits from mobile nurses, 2,834 vaccinations, 6,951 smallpox vaccinations, and 312 childbirth guidance sessions. A total of 13,122 days of hospital treatment were provided to members. Among the illnesses suffered by members, skin diseases were the most common, accounting for 33.51%, followed by eye, ear, nose, and throat diseases, accounting for 19.87%, miscellaneous diseases accounting for 11.78%, trauma accounting for 10.76%, lung diseases accounting for 8%, gastrointestinal diseases accounting for 9.87%, and venereal diseases accounting for 6%. A total of 348 members were treated as inpatients in the association's hospital, with 325 members recovering and being discharged. Sixty members quit smoking, and 54 have successfully quit smoking and been discharged.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Timely Rainfall</h3>
<p>Recently, the local area has been experiencing heavy fog in the early mornings and late evenings, along with very warm weather. However, before dawn yesterday, there was a sudden and much-needed rainfall, which continued intermittently throughout the day. Shanghai's rainfall is usually very scarce from autumn to winter, and the fields have not been adequately moistened. This timely rainfall is of great benefit. Although the rain has stopped since evening, the dense fog has reappeared, so the weather is unlikely to clear up soon.</p>
<h3>Manager of Jin Tai Bank and Others Acquitted</h3>
<p>The manager of Jin Tai Bank, Lin Pingfu, and the accountant, Feng Kaishu, were sued by Li Zicheng, a director and supervisor of the bank, in the First Special District Court for destroying documents. Lin and others also countersued Li for concealing accounting books. After several court hearings, the case was concluded, and yesterday afternoon, Judge Dai opened the court and acquitted both parties.</p>
<h3>Candle Industry Labor-Management Cooperation for Improvement</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Candle Industry Trade Association and the Candle Industry Workers' Union, in order to stabilize the livelihood of their members, signed a cooperative agreement that was approved by the Social Affairs Bureau last month.

<h3>Accusation of Abetting Perjury Case: Gu Zhuxuan Interrogated Yesterday. Gu's Testimony Claims Utter Innocence and Lack of Substantial Funds. Zhang Xiaosizi's Statement Alleges Custodial Assistance.</h3>
<p>Gu Zhuxuan, due to the accusation by the perpetrator Zhao Guangfu and Zhang Xiaosizi (namely Tinggui) in the Tang Jiapeng murder case of instigating assassination, was arrested and sent to the Second Special Court by the Legal Police Department, sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment. Gu appealed to the High Third Branch Court, and while awaiting the pronouncement of the final judgment, Zhang Xiaosizi again accused Gu Zhuxuan to the High Third Branch Court of bribing the guards Ma Xianxiang and Ma Xiancai, brothers, to fund and instruct a retraction of testimony. The case revealed that the Ma brothers and</p>
<p>Wang Yushou and Wang Bogang, two guards</p>
<p>involved in the affair, successively fled. Subsequently, the Chief Prosecutor of the Second Special Court conducted an investigation and first confirmed with the Great Asia Bank that there was indeed a deposit of 2,000 yuan under the name of Zhang Sen. Furthermore, it was alleged that the Warden of the Custodial Office, Wu Lu, the guard Ma Xianxiang, and Gu's brother, Gu Songmao, were also involved. According to the law, the Criminal Division of the same court initiated a public prosecution against Gu Zhuxuan, Gu Songmao, Wu Lu, Ma Xianxiang, etc., for the crimes of abetting perjury and dereliction of duty. Presiding Judge Li Changnian</p>
<p>adjourned the trial without conclusion,</p>
<p>and ordered Gu Songmao and Ma Xianxiang to be released on bail. The case is now being handled by Presiding Judge Chen Shuoying, who scheduled a hearing for yesterday. Details of the situation were reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM, Judge Chen, accompanied by the Chief Prosecutor and Clerk Wang Baoxun, arrived at the Second Criminal Court to continue the trial. Defendant Gu Zhuxuan was brought from the Second Special Prison, Wu Lu from the Custodial Office, and witnesses Zhang Xiaosizi, Zhao Guangfu, and Cao Shida were escorted separately by police officers from the Second Prison under the jurisdiction of the North New Business Department. Gu Songmao arrived with his defense lawyer, Jiang Yiping, and Ma Xianxiang, released on bail,</p>
<p>had not arrived from his hometown.</p>
<p>His defense lawyer arrived on his behalf. The court, after inquiring about the age and origin of Gu Zhuxuan, Gu Songmao, and Wu Lu, announced the commencement of the new trial and requested the prosecutor to present the indictment. Prosecutor Wang stood up and stated that the indictment was detailed in the indictment. The officer then questioned Gu Zhuxuan, "After being convicted by this court for the murder case, you appealed to the High Third Branch Court. How did you instigate Zhao Guangfu and Zhang Xiaosizi to retract their testimony?" Gu replied, "This is absolutely not the case. I do not know the Ma by name, nor have I ever been to the outer sick ward. Regarding</p>
<p>the bank deposit,</p>
<p>whether it was deposited by me, after my arrest, I was detained in the outer sick ward. There were two Annamese and a Jia surnamed person there guarding and monitoring me. When family members came to visit, they could not talk much either. I have not committed any crime. If I had committed a crime, I would be willing to spend some money. Moreover, I have not committed any crime at all. It is completely based on anonymous letters and leaflets that I am being prosecuted. I have been brought to the point of losing my family and my fortune. How could I have such a large sum of money to deposit in the bank for this purpose? Regarding the instigation of retraction of testimony, I am completely unaware of the true situation." After the testimony, he claimed to be suffering from illness, with leg cramps, numbness, and shaking, unable to stand. He asked his lawyer to request</p>
<p>the court to grant him a seat.</p>
<p>Lawyer Jiang Yiping immediately petitioned the court to allow the bailiff to take him outside the courtroom to sit and rest. Wu Lu then testified, "I serve as the Warden in the Custodial Office of this court. The outer sick ward was originally guarded by prison guards. Later, the warden requested personnel from the Custodial Office, so I was sent there. When someone came to visit Gu Zhuxuan, they would first register at the Custodial Office, and then a person would be assigned to accompany them to the outer sick ward for the visit. There were guards and detectives from the police station and Annamese monitoring. I did not interfere. Sometimes Gu's servants would bring things, which were also often</p>
<p>inspected in front of the police personnel.</p>
<p>I have absolutely no knowledge of Gu Zhuxuan instigating retraction of testimony. If I had done such a thing, wouldn't I have run away instead of waiting here to face a lawsuit? I beg for clarification." Gu Songmao testified, "Gu San is my brother's rank, hence the name Gu San. When I was eighteen years old, the brothers divided the family property. Zhuxuan is my younger brother. After he was arrested, he fell ill. I visited him several times. I do not know Wu, Ma, etc. I went once every three or four days, a total of four or five times. When I went, there were Annamese personnel with guns and plainclothes Chinese people monitoring nearby. My brother and I could not say much when we met.</p>
<p>We were oppressed everywhere.</p>
<p>I am very ashamed and do not want to talk to the Custodial Office and the people in the outer sick ward too much. I can only ask a lawyer to handle my brother's case according to the law and seek redress. I know nothing about the deposit in the Great Asia Bank. I do not even know where the bank is." He asked, "The deposit in the bank was verified by the prosecutor to be real, according to Zhang Xiaosizi, the money was deposited by you." He replied, "No, this is someone framing me. I heard rumors outside that they would first bring down Gu Si with a lawsuit, and then bring down Gu San. Initially,</p>
<p>people extorted</p>
<p>my brother, wanting several hundred yuan. He did not agree, leading to a lawsuit. How could he be willing to spend a large sum of money to give them? Nor would he deposit money in the bank and give the deposit slip as proof, inviting a lawsuit on himself. I absolutely do not know Ma Xianxiang and Ma Xiancai, nor have they ever been to my house. Even my sister-in-law does not have a large sum of money to pay. If she did, she would have to discuss it with me. Moreover, his family has no money to use and is now borrowing from me," etc. At this point, Zhang Xiaosizi was brought in to testify. "Ma Xianxiang is the guard on my floor in the prison. He gave me the deposit slip. Initially, the deposit was under</p>
<p>the name of Huang Chunhua.</p>
<p>He showed me the slip. Later, because I could not go to withdraw the money in prison, I asked him to change it to a three-year term. Later, Ma only showed me the slip, refusing to give it to me. Until around 7 PM on February 4th, he again showed me the deposit slip through the iron gate, having already changed it to Zhang Sen's name. I immediately snatched the slip and started arguing. Ma asked inmate Cao Shida to say that he would temporarily store it for Cao's safekeeping and return it to me after the court session. Later, when the court session came, I changed my testimony. Ma still refused to return the slip to me, so I reported it to the High Third Branch Court. Initially, Ma Xianxiang said that this money was paid by Zhang San and deposited in</p>
<p>the bank by Ma, Gu San, and Zheng Jian San.</p>
<p>I do not know Wu Lu. Wang Yu [character unclear] said to me in Zhao Guangfu's place that he would contact Zhao about the matter." Zhao Guangfu testified, "Ma Xianxiang said to me, 'You accused Gu Zhuxuan simply because you wanted money. He said there was a way to get some money to use.' He asked me to discuss it with Zhang Xiaosizi, but I did not agree. Later, he contacted Zhang. After that, Ma gave me a slip to look at, saying it was two thousand yuan. Because it was dark in the evening, I did not see clearly. Wang Yushou did not</p>
<p>say anything to me.</p>
<p>I do not know Wu Lu." Finally, Cao Shida testified, "One morning, Ma asked me to write a receipt, telling me that the slip had been snatched by Zhang and could not be recovered. Ma wanted me to keep it and give it to Zhang after the court session. Zhang agreed to let me keep the slip on his behalf and asked me to issue a receipt to Zhang for future exchange. Later, after the court session, Shou suddenly asked me to return the slip and promised me 400 yuan, but I did not agree because Zhang wanted to reclaim the slip without explanation. On the day of the final decision, Ma ran away," etc. Ma Xianxiang's defense lawyer stated that Ma had stayed in an inn for nearly two months after being released on bail and had now returned to his hometown in</p>
<p>Wo Tang, Anhui.</p>
<p>The summons had been sent, and it would take seven or eight days for it to arrive, so he could not attend the hearing today. He could attend the next court session. The court ordered to wait for rescheduling and further questioning. Gu Songmao remained released on the original bail, and the others were returned to custody. Finally, the officer questioned Gu Zhuxuan again, saying that according to a document from the Sixth District Security Command of Jiangsu Province, a certain Gu Yiqing from your hometown of Yancheng accused Wei Changxin of</p>
<p>privately storing military weapons.</p>
<p>In 1931, there were twenty-three pistols and seven box cannons. According to Wei, you bought eight rifles for official business in 1932. Do you know about this?" Gu replied, "It needs to be investigated with the county government. I sent a portable machine gun to protect the local area, and Director Du contacted me at that time," etc. The officer ordered Gu to provide witnesses for verification and await a reply. Then, he ordered the court to adjourn.</p>
<h3>Stealing Customs Declarations and Fraudulently Obtaining Loans: A Series of Four Crimes; Lu Zhiqing and Others to be Escorted to Court Today</h3>
<p>Lu Zhiqing from Ningbo, formerly worked as a customs broker at the Minli Customs Declaration Agency in this port. After becoming unemployed, because he was familiar with customs declaration procedures, he used seven privately made counterfeit keys made of lead, which could open the consignment note boxes in Jianghai Customs belonging to ten customs declaration agencies in this port, including Jingji, Yongxingchang, Dachang, Gongxing, Meisheng, Tongtai Nantong, Tong Fengtai, Yong Taifeng, and Taiguchang. He stole consignment notes and fraudulently obtained goods. In September of this year, he privately opened a box of Tongtai Agency, stole a bill of lading, and went to the warehouse to fraudulently claim ten boxes of imported grapes, selling them using the fabricated name of Hongxin Canned Food Company. On the tenth of this month, he used the same method again, stole a bill of lading from Jingji Agency, hired a car to fraudulently claim ten boxes of lotus seeds from the China Merchants South Warehouse. After the agency reported this to the Customs Water Patrol Police Station for investigation, clues were obtained, and the Lu suspect was arrested. He confessed the location of the stolen goods at Huiheji No. 129 Zongyuan Road in the city. In a second loft, inside an empty coffin, the original stolen goods were recovered, and seven counterfeit keys were also found. Hui Yongfeng, the owner of the store, was also brought in for questioning. The detectives believed that the case was of great importance and divided their efforts to investigate each customs declaration agency. They discovered that the China Hat and Wool Weaving Company of Meiyuan Road, Zhabei, purchased thirty dozen softwood hat blanks from Guangdong on March 7 of this year, delivered them to the Taigu Company's Jinan ship for transport to Shanghai, and stored them in the company's No. 10 warehouse, entrusting Gongxing Customs Declaration Agency at No. 21 Shenxing Lane, Zilai Street, French Concession, to handle import customs declaration procedures. Lu committed the same crime, stole the agency's bill of lading, claimed the hat blanks, and sold them to the Hong Kong Softwood Hat Company at No. 1, Lane 265, Jingzhou Road, Yangshupu. The detectives, together with the Yulin Road Police Station, summoned Zhou Yefu, the owner of the company, to the police station for questioning and ordered him to await a court summons. It was also found that the Huacheng Cigarette Company of this port delivered fifteen boxes of Three Fresh Brand cigarettes to Chongqing on the Minquan ship last month, entrusting Meisheng Customs Declaration Agency on Maohai Road, Tilanqiao, to handle export customs declaration procedures. The waybill No. 090599 for inspection along the way, after being verified and issued by the Customs, was also stolen by the Lu suspect. Although the goods were not defrauded, the goods would still have to pay taxes along the way due to the loss of this waybill. The police station then retrieved this waybill based on the Lu suspect's confession. The police chief, believing that the defendant had committed four serial crimes, ordered that he be escorted to the District Court for questioning this afternoon, along with the suspect who concealed the stolen goods, Hui Yongfeng.</p>
<h3>Datong Pharmacy Accused of Counterfeiting and Impersonating Trademarked Medicines; Huang Futang and Others Released on Cash Bail; The Case Scheduled for Pronouncement Next Monday</h3>
<p>The Huaan Pharmacy on Hubei Road previously found that the Datong Pharmacy at Lane 300, Guangdong Road, was counterfeiting Huaan's anti-smoking medicine, Black Sea Star, and Puda Factory's Hundred Supplement Dwarf Squash Essence, selling them in the market and infringing on their rights. They reported this information to the General Inspectorate of the General Concession Police. Chinese Detective Feng Zhiming went to the Datong Pharmacy for investigation and found it to be true. He arrested the manager, Huang Futang, the accountant, Jing Gengsheng, and the shop assistant, Chen Shengguan, one after another, confiscated a large number of various counterfeit medicines, and sent them to the First Special Court for questioning and detention. Details of this situation have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Presiding Judge Pan Zhenyang came to the Second Criminal Court to continue the hearing. Police lawyer Qian Xunji filed a lawsuit according to the law and presented the facts of the case, stating that the Datong Pharmacy was opened by Gui Yaohua, who is now at large, specializing in the production of various counterfeit medicines, selling them in the market. Huang Futang, who was arrested, is the general manager, Jing Gengsheng is the accountant, and Chen Shengguan is the shop assistant, all of which are beyond doubt. They should be sentenced according to the law. When questioned, the defendants hired lawyer Fan Gang to court to defend them and request bail. The Huaan Pharmacy, etc., also hired a lawyer to court to file a civil suit, requesting the court to order the defendants to compensate for the losses. The court debated the case and concluded the arguments, scheduling the pronouncement for next Monday. Defendant Huang Futang was allowed to be released on a cash bail of 3,000 yuan, Jing Gengsheng was released on a cash bail of 2,000 yuan, and Chen Shengguan was released on a cash bail of 500 yuan, and they were allowed to leave and await the pronouncement.</p>
<h3>Qiu Peilin, Wanted by the Court, Surrenders Himself at the Portuguese Flag at the New World; Accused of Damaging Creditor Rights in a Case</h3>
<p>Qiu Peilin, a silk merchant from Wuxing, Zhejiang, is 35 years old and resides at No. 4 Yuchiaqing Road. Before 1934, Qiu had leased the land at the intersection of Jingansi Road and Yuchiaqing Road at the New World Amusement Park from the real estate tycoon Cheng Linsheng. When the lease expired in 1934, Cheng filed a lawsuit against Qiu in the First Special Court to terminate the lease and demand relocation. As a result, Qiu lost the case. When the case was being executed, Qiu suddenly hoisted the Portuguese flag on the roof of the New World. Because Portugal enjoyed consular jurisdiction, the court's execution was obstructed. After investigation, the police station learned that Qiu was indeed damaging creditor rights and, because Qiu's whereabouts were unknown, requested the First Special Court to issue an arrest warrant. However, they were unable to arrest him. Recently, the Legal Department of the Public Works Bureau suddenly received a letter from Qiu's attorney, stating that Qiu had previously been ill and had gone to another port for recuperation. Now that he had recovered and returned to Shanghai, he heard that the court had issued an arrest warrant and intended to surrender himself. The department replied in a letter, ordering him to surrender to the Xinzha Police Station, which was handling the case. Yesterday morning at 4:00 AM, Qiu did surrender to the Xinzha Police Station. Chinese Detective Weng Peiyu and Ma Derong detained Qiu and escorted him to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court at 9:00 AM. Police Officer Qian Xunji filed a lawsuit according to Article 356 of the Criminal Code, and Qiu also hired lawyer Yu Chengxiu to defend him. Presiding Judge Pan Zhenyang stated that the case still required the retrieval of files and rescheduled the hearing. Qiu was ordered to provide a guarantor.</p>
<h3>The Electricity Industry Association Opens an Accounting Training Class</h3>
<p>The National Private Electricity Industry Association held its eighth annual meeting in the capital this time.

<h3>Accusation of Bigamy After Divorce; The Case Still Requires Investigation; Zhuang Tinggui Proves Divorce; Zhu Yundi Denies It Throughout</h3>
<p>Zhuang Tinggui, the brother of Zhuang Tinglu, the owner of the Xinhengtai Iron Factory at No. 102 Singapore Road, and his wife, Zhu Yundi, had disagreements, so they agreed to divorce on July 11 of this year. Zhuang paid Zhu氏 3,000 yuan in alimony. On September 7, Zhuang married Luo Lili (also known as Xiulin), a woman from Pudong, at Yipinxian. Zhu氏 recently denied that she had divorced Zhuang and reported Zhuang and Luo to the Laozha Police Station for bigamy. A public prosecution was filed. When the First Special Court heard the case, the defendant's lawyer, Chen Tingrui, presented the divorce agreement signed by Zhu and Zhuang as proof. However, Zhu denied signing the agreement. The court had to investigate whether the agreement was authentic. Yesterday morning, this case was scheduled for a continued hearing. Chief Judge Qian Hongye took the seat in the First Criminal Court to hear the case. First, police lawyer Ru Baoyi presented the case, followed by Chinese Detective Zhang Yuanjing, who stated that he had gone to the residences of Zhu Yundi and Zhuang Tinggui to search based on the search warrant issued by the court. Nothing was found at Zhu's residence, but at Zhuang's residence, he found an account book, a check stub book, and a bank statement from the Bank of Communications, all of which had records of payments to Zhu. He immediately presented them to the court. Then, witness Chen Xikang testified that the divorce between Zhuang and Zhu was indeed a fact. At that time, Zhuang paid Zhu氏 3,349 yuan, and I was one of the people present. The words on the agreement were also signed by Ms. Zhu herself. Subsequently, Zhuang Tinglu testified that there was indeed a divorce, but Ms. Zhu denied it throughout. The court then ordered her to write ten characters and postponed the hearing because further investigation was necessary. It also ordered lawyer Chen Tingrui to try to mediate a reconciliation to avoid litigation.</p>
<h3>The Murderer Said He Was Avenging His Father; Chopped the Monk with a Knife; Cheng Kai Bleeding Profusely, Almost Dead; The Mother Did Not Want Her Son to be Severely Punished</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at about 3:00 PM, the abbot of Taiping Temple, Dharma name Cheng Kai, at No. 1875 on the west end of Zhongxing Road, Zhabei, was suddenly chopped with a kitchen knife on the top of his head by Cao Gui, the son of the landlord who lived in the same building. Someone reported this to the Taiyangmiao Police Station of the Xinzha Sub-bureau, which dispatched police officers to the scene, bringing the injured monk, the perpetrator Cao Gui, and Cao's biological mother, Ms. Hu, to the station. Officer Yang immediately sent the injured monk to Pushan Hospital on Xinmin Road for treatment. Dr. Lu Maiyuan examined and found that the skull had been fractured, and more than three pounds of blood had been lost. He immediately performed surgery to stop the bleeding and, after bandaging the wound, sent him back to the police station. Cao Gui [character unclear] stated that he was 19 years old, from Suqian County, Jiangbei. I used to work as a helper in a Westerner's house, and now I am at home. The monk is my tenant, living in the front, and I live in the back. I also have two brothers. My father, who was originally the captain of the Shanghai North Security Regiment at the Dayang Bridge, also opened a rice store and a southern goods store. He died in March of this year. Unexpectedly, since my father's death, the monk not only lived in my house without paying rent but also collected my rent. Not only that, but he is now acting as my father and driving my brothers out. My brother has moved to Zhiheli, Hengfeng Road. I couldn't stand it, so I wanted to chop him to death to avenge my father. Cao's mother, Ms. Hu, stated that she was 55 years old. I don't want this son anymore. I ask you, sir, to severely punish him. Cheng Kai stated that he was 28 years old, from Yangzhou. Today, because Gui Lin wanted to borrow 30 yuan from me, and I didn't lend it to him, he took a kitchen knife and chopped me from behind when I wasn't prepared, injuring me. After the interrogating officer verified the confessions, he immediately reported the case to the Xinzha Sub-bureau, as it was a criminal matter. The bureau member, after learning the details, ordered that a document be prepared and sent to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. Later, someone went to Pushan Hospital to investigate whether the injured monk's life was in danger. According to the doctor, due to excessive bleeding, there was a risk of death.</p>
<h3>The Public Works Department of the Public Works Bureau Implements a Reduction Policy</h3>
<p>Regarding the internal austerity measures of the Public Works Bureau, according to information from the bureau's Information Office, the bureau's Public Works Department, in the past year, until October 31 of this year, as a result of reducing administrative staff and laying off employees, can save 280,000 yuan annually from now on. Among them, 220,000 yuan is from foreign staff, and 60,000 yuan is from Chinese staff. The factors that contributed to this reduction were, on the one hand, the reorganization of staff in the department, and on the other hand, the vigorous economization of public construction expenses.</p>

<h3>Huang Qingsheng and His Sister-in-Law Live Together; The Accusation Case Has Been Resolved; The Wife Understood and Did Not Want to Pursue It Further; The Private Prosecution Was Withdrawn and the Public Prosecution Was Acquitted</h3>
<p>Huang Qingsheng, a local man who is a foreign secretary at the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, married a Ningbo woman, Huang Zhou氏, ten years ago. They lived together at No. 44 Jinfu Lane, Avenue Haig. They have a daughter named Qibi. However, Huang Zhou氏 has a younger sister named Zhou Yinglan, who is 26 years old. Because she often visited her sister, she had an affair with her brother-in-law, Huang Qingsheng. In December of last year, Huang Qingsheng, taking advantage of his wife's miscarriage, rented a house on Baike Road with Zhou Yinglan at No. 35 Yongnian Lane, living together like a married couple. He abandoned his wife and daughter, ignoring them. Huang Zhou氏 recently discovered the secret and, with lawyer Fan Gang, reported it to the Xinzha Police Station. They dispatched Chinese Detective Liao Huaguo to Baike Road to arrest Huang Qingsheng and Zhou Yinglan. They were taken to the police station and ordered to await questioning. The police station filed a lawsuit with the First Special Court according to Article 239 of the Criminal Code for hindering marriage and Article 294 for abandonment. The case has been questioned once and postponed to a later date. It is now known that during the postponement, both sides' relatives acted as mediators and obtained Huang Zhou氏's understanding, who did not want to pursue it further. Therefore, yesterday morning, when Judge Fu Lin heard the case, police lawyer Wang Yaotang stood up and stated that, regarding the part of hindering marriage, the plaintiff had declared to the police station that she had withdrawn the complaint the day before. According to the articles of the indictment, this was a case where a prosecution was necessary, so he requested permission to withdraw it. Regarding the part of abandonment, he still requested to proceed. Huang Zhou氏 also testified that her daughter, Huang Qibi, was raised by her mother-in-law, and she is still with her aunt. When questioned, both defendants hired lawyers Wu Linkun and Wang Shuxun to court to request an acquittal. The court ordered that the part of the prosecution of Huang Qingsheng and Zhou Yinglan for hindering marriage was not accepted, and Huang Qingsheng was acquitted of the part of the prosecution for abandonment.</p>

You lead a hundred thousand troops to safeguard one area. Your glory is admired and deeply respected. Now that the powerful enemy is rampant, encroaching and nibbling away, the border alarms in Suiyuan are frequently reported, and the whole country is deeply indignant.

Defending the border and guarding the territory, the people of the country regard you as the Great Wall. Our association respectfully presents an embroidered banner to promote your might.

Looking north to the border, we are extremely indignant. At the same time, we are pleased to learn that our army is fighting the enemy in the ice and snow, with a hundredfold courage. The invading enemy army has suffered losses and retreated, but since it is a planned invasion, it is difficult to guarantee that it will not invade again. You are working hard day and night to command the battle, and all the soldiers are bravely killing the enemy. They continue to make efforts to protect the northern gate and contribute to the country. All our citizens should pay their deep respects. Our colleagues are far away in Shanghai, and we are unable to go to the front line to share the labor of defending the country. However, considering that our entire Chinese country is closely related to each other, and that it is not different due to the separation of north and south, and that Suiyuan protects Jin and Hebei, which is related to the safety of the whole country, we should defend it with the power of the whole country. The government is planning the overall situation and has appropriate plans every day. Our colleagues, in order to seek peace of mind and express our patriotic sincerity, have set aside a part of our living expenses, and we will entrust the bank to remit it immediately to help the frontline soldiers make cold clothes.

<h3>Securities: Public Bond Trading Gradually Thins Out in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange continued to experience a sharp decline. The arrival of Chairman Chiang and the intensification of the war made it unlikely that the situation could be resolved in the short term. Most long positions were uncertain and rushed to sell. However, retail investors partially offset the selling pressure. Market conditions showed that some long positions were still trying to prop up prices, but any recovery was quickly followed by a decline. Throughout the day, the E-type 34th issue was actively bought at the opening, but only this issue and the D-type issue for the current month were raised by 0.05 to 0.15 yuan. The remaining issues were under heavy selling pressure from various groups. Although the 34th issue actively absorbed the selling pressure, it was ultimately overpowered by the strong selling from the 6th, 35th, and 53rd northern groups, causing prices to decline. Afterward, the A-type issue fell by a small margin of 0.45 yuan. The 34th issue suddenly stopped buying at the close, and the 4th, 16th, and 32nd issues continued to experience strong selling pressure. Active short sellers caused prices to fall further by 0.1 to 0.25 yuan. In the afternoon, market sentiment remained weak, and trading thinned out, with mostly retail transactions. Only the 75th issue experienced some selling pressure, and the market continued to fall by 0.15 to 0.3 yuan. At the close, retail investors slightly covered their short positions, and some temporary short positions also covered. The E- and D-type issues fell by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan, and later issues recovered slightly by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. As a result, prices continued to fall by 0.25 to 0.75 yuan. The total turnover was 10.1 million yuan. The comparison of the resulting gains and losses is listed below (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Spot Sales Remain Weak; Cotton Yarn Continues to Decline—But Buying Strength Remains Strong</h3>
<p>The yarn market was flat in the morning and fell in the afternoon, but the overall trend was still bullish, because Osaka's Sanpin yarn market was expensive. Major yarn merchants have been actively absorbing recently, and the stock of yarn in this port is only 14,000 bales. Therefore, the buying force is even stronger. Unfortunately, the sluggish spot yarn sales are a deficiency. The future situation is still in turbulence.</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Futures Recovered Slightly at the Third Close</p>
<p>The standard yarn futures market opened in the morning, and the current month's momentum was very strong, because major merchants tightened their grip and did not let go. The Osaka second-grade yarn market stepped into a high territory. Many parties looked bullish, and their minds were bright. After the second round, news of yarn sales stagnated, and the market loosened. More shorts closed their positions, and the market fell back. As a result, each month fell by 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, but the current month rose by 0.2 yuan. The market opened in the afternoon, and the market mistakenly spread that the Qingdao yarn market had fallen, and people's hearts were not strong, and retail investors sold off and fell. In the second round, the current month plummeted 3.3 yuan, and the distant month also fell 1.67 yuan. However, by the end of the month, a certain cotton company and Indian merchants actively bought in, and the market situation turned firm. The current month suddenly rose 2.1 yuan in the third round, and the distant month also rose by more than 1 yuan. It is said that the price of Sanpin yarn is too high, and speculators are constantly absorbing it. As a result, each month fell again by 0.9 to 1.15 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was found that 1,550 bales of Mingde were sold, 2,650 bales of Senkang, 3,600 bales of Shenji, 2,000 bales of Dachangcheng, 1,600 bales of Shengyuan, 2,500 bales of Tonghe, 1,550 bales of Jinkang, 1,200 bales of Changyu, 1,450 bales of Wang Taixing, 2,300 bales of Run, and 1,550 bales of Xiecheng.

<p>Inland 30 Hankou 5 Tianjin 20 Guangdong 30</p>
<h3>The Pressure on Cotton Market Sellers is Very Heavy</h3>
<p>The cotton market is calm, but the public opinion is bearish, and the pressure from the sellers is very heavy. However, the current month's futures market situation turned bullish, because there is a lack of new chips to unravel, and the amount of deposits is still huge. Dafu on behalf of a certain party began to cover the shorts. The selling price in various producing areas is unwilling to loosen, and the standard market situation may have a revolving situation.</p>
<p>Standard Cotton Stems and Falls</p>
<p>The standard cotton market opened in the morning, because the Japanese factory labor unrest resumed, and the US cotton rose and fell interchangeably, up and down one to two pounds, but the Indian cotton rose one and a half rupees, the market situation was mediocre, and each month fell by 0.15 to 0.2 yuan. After the second round of price falls, the sellers were not strong, because the township Yan insisted very hard, and the market situation turned high. As a result, each month did not rise or fall much, but the current month rose by 0.1 yuan. The market opened in the afternoon, and it plummeted by 0.23 yuan due to the virtual wind of the yarn market. However, the near-month short position activity offset, and after the second round, it rose step by step with the yarn market. As a result, each month fell by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Zhen Da sold 1,600 dan, Jifeng 1,200 dan, Juxing 1,600 dan, Yongyu 2,000 dan, Fengtai 2,500 dan, Yicheng 3,500 dan, Yichang 2,500 dan, Runkang 1,400 dan, Shengyuan 1,900 dan, Yikang 4,600 dan, Shenfei 2,500 dan, Dachang 1,700, Tonghe 1,900, Dafu bought 4,200 dan, Changyu 1,800 dan, Xingchang 1,700, Renfeng 1,200 dan, Dachangcheng 1,200 dan, Mingde 1,700 dan, Minghua 2,900 dan, Yuanxingchang 3,600 dan, Daqing 3,400 dan, Gengfeng 2,800 dan, Changfeng 2,400 dan, and Taichang 2,200 dan. The highest and lowest and closing prices in one day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Has Both Arrived and Sold</p>
<p>The current spot cotton consumption is flat, the factory demand is not healthy, the source is 942 bales of Yao cotton and 884 bales of Tong cotton.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Japanese Factory Yarn October Export Statistics</h3>

<h3>US Cotton is Concentrated in the December Term to Close</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened, and each month rose by one to six pounds. The in-house transaction was concentrated in the December period to close the multi-head, because the delivery note will be published from the 24th of this month. In the early morning, the Liverpool news was good. The entire east of the central cotton area had severe frost. Foreign firms and colleagues bought, and the market price was firm. Then, some multi-head closed and cotton farmers hedged and returned. However, at around the closing price on the previous day, there were buy-ins. Spot cotton and cloth were very firm. Before the close, the buy-ins of the same industry were overturned by the hedge sale. It is estimated that the spot rose by one pound, and the futures rose and fell by one to two pounds. British cotton spot rose by 8 points, and futures rose by 67 points. Indian cotton European exporters bought, which was overturned by the close of multi-head. It is estimated that the Pingguoer rose 1.5 to 2 rupees, and Aomla and Bai Luoxi rose 1 rupee each. The original telegram is recorded on the left. (17th electric)</p>
<p>According to the Mumbai telegram, the opening forecast on the 18th was that Bai Luoxi was 217 rupees, up 0.25 rupees, Aomla was 197.5 rupees, unchanged, and Pingguoer was 159 rupees, unchanged.</p>
<h3>The Three Grades of Yarn and Cotton Rose and Fell Intermittently</h3>
<p>On the 18th, Osaka Electric reported that the two-grade futures yarn fell 0.3 yuan to rise 1.2 yuan, the recent month was 238.2 yuan, the distant month was 212.5 yuan, the futures cotton fell 0.25 to 0.4 yuan, the recent month was 65.55 yuan, and the distant month was 66.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Food: Flour Spot Sales Have Slightly Improved</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market showed an initial fatigue followed by a bullish trend in each month after the opening in the morning. Foreign wheat quotations had a difference of about 0.1 yuan, and various places suffered from early drought and received light rain, so the opening price initially seemed weak. This month once fell by 0.01 yuan. Subsequently, due to many troubles in the current situation and the inevitability of the war in the northern road, spot sales slightly increased, and people's hearts also moved in a bullish direction, rising by more than 0.01 yuan compared to the initial opening. When the market opened in the afternoon, people's hearts were bullish again, and it was close to the morning. However, there is still a lot of current stock in each factory, and the people in the industry are calm, so it turned weak again after the second round. This situation is still revolving, because the purchases from various roads are ultimately too high in market value, and it is inevitable that they will lose their position.</p>
<h3>The Situation Influences the Wheat Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday's future wheat market showed a nearly flat and distant stable trend in each month after the opening in the morning. Although the foreign wheat quotation has few ups and downs, it is feared that the wheat from the north will be affected due to the situation. Therefore, although the transaction is rare, people's hearts are quite strong. The price below December is higher than the previous day, with a rise of 0.045 yuan. When the market opened in the afternoon, the current month shouted 0.02 yuan due to short covering. The distant period had continued to be good by 0.0125 yuan. Then, the long-headed slightly released, and it also fell by 0.034 yuan. After this, if the current situation is steadily gathered, it will temporarily be stable. The current wheat is still stable, such as Shandong Wuhe Mingguang Special High Wheat opened at 6.05 yuan and then to 6.045 yuan, Guandian Zhang Baling Wheat 6 yuan, Jiangbei Wheat 5.988, and then to 0.89, Hankou Che Wheat 5.97, and then to 0.756, Fuxin handled 11,000 packages, and Shen Da 1,000 packages.</p>
<h3>Ke Xian North Sales Gradually Move</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the head of each road guest decreased, and the arrival was only two or three thousand bags. The northern digestion gradually became active, such as Henan Luoyang Jinpu along the road have handling and installation, and Ji Yuan rice is asked about by Shantou Henan on this street. The cargo owners also hold on to each other because the arrival head is not strong, and the market can still stand. However, the Cantonese gang stopped, and the brown rice was slightly stagnant. Jiangxi rice 1,020 bags, Hunan rice 518 bags, and Wen Tai Yong rice 1,500 bags were opened throughout the day. The market situation is similar to that of the previous market.</p>
<h3>Investigation: Shanghai Price Index for October of the 25th Year</h3>
<p>According to the report from the Tariff Committee, the Shanghai wholesale, export, and import price indices, as well as the cost of living index for October of the 25th year, all rose compared to the previous month. The rise was most significant in wholesale prices, at 2.5%, and least significant in export prices, at 0.2%. The increase in the indices was largely due to the rise in prices of wheat, flour, cotton yarn, and cotton cloth. From the 15th of this month compared to the 15th of November, the price of wheat rose by 12%, flour by 14%, cotton by 2% to 5%, cotton yarn by 4% to 9%, and cotton cloth by 3% to 17%. In the latter part of this month, the price increase of these items became even more pronounced. Compared to the 15th of the previous month, the prices of wheat and flour each rose by 20%, cotton by 2% to 9%, cotton yarn by 13% to 20%, and cotton cloth by 7% to nearly 32%. However, the indices do not reflect such a dramatic increase. This is partly because the market price changes of other items have generally been moderate, and partly because the price increases of wheat, flour, and other items in the latter part of this month have not yet been reflected in the indices (the wholesale price index is based on the market price on the 15th of each month, and the cost of living index is based on the average of the 1st and 15th of each month). As for the reasons for the sharp rise in the market prices of wheat, flour, and other items, the main reasons are: firstly, this year's agricultural harvest was abundant, and the purchasing power of rural areas has slightly improved; secondly, the tense diplomatic situation in recent months has caused people to become anxious, and the futures prices of several major food and clothing items have soared, which has affected spot prices; and thirdly, in recent years, various banks in Shanghai have gradually invested in rural areas, providing loans secured by agricultural products as collateral, and the agricultural storage business has also made considerable progress, which should have a regulatory effect on the situation of supply exceeding demand during the new crop season.</p>
<p>(1) Wholesale Price Index: The general index is 109.7, an increase of 2.5% compared to the previous month, and an increase of 16.6% compared to the same month last year. Compared to the previous month, all eight categories of indices rose, except for building materials, which remained stable. The increases were larger for food and textiles, followed by miscellaneous items, metals, and other foods. The increase rates for fuel and chemicals were less than 1%. The food category rose by 4.9%. New shipments of Suchang white rice gradually poured into Shanghai, and selling prices fell. Bean products either experienced sluggish sales or new loans entered the market, leading to a general decline in prices. Red sorghum and corn experienced insufficient supply, and buyers from Shantou and Guangdong actively purchased 客秈 (ke xian) rice, causing prices to rise, although not by much. The sharp rise in the food index was mainly due to the soaring prices of wheat and flour. The textile category includes 38 items, of which cotton, yarn, and cotton cloth account for 21 items, nearly one-third of the total number of items in this category. As prices rose sharply this month, the index for this category rose by 3.7%. The miscellaneous category index rose by 2.3%. Pork prices soared, and soap, pig bristles, cowhide, and tung oil also rose sharply. The metal category rose by 2.2%. Prices of lead, tin, and copper rose overseas, and there was a shortage of white lead wire and ship steel plates in stock, leading to a uniform increase in selling prices. The other food category rose by 2.0%, due to the scarcity of pork, soybean oil, and salted fish, and brisk sales of eggs, egg whites, and sesame, as well as a shortage of ham in stock, all of which led to a firm increase in prices.</p>
<p>(2) Export Price Index: The general index is 96.1, an increase of 0.2% compared to the previous month, and an increase of 19.2% compared to the same month last year. Compared to the previous month, the indices for raw materials slightly decreased, while the indices for semi-finished products and consumer goods both increased. Raw materials decreased by 0.7%. Although the index change was small, there were quite a few items with dramatic market price increases and decreases. For example, hog casings were scarce due to limited supply from inland areas, while demand from Europe and the United States increased. Since October of last year, the number of orders from foreign merchants has been quite large, and the delivery deadline has arrived, so it has been necessary to raise the purchase price to fulfill the contracts. The market price per hundred pieces rose from 42.20 yuan last month to 55 yuan this month, an increase of 30%. Other items such as rapeseed rose by 15%, wheat rose by 12%, and rapeseed cake and 建松板 (jian song ban) each rose by 10%. However, red beans and peanuts experienced price declines of 10% and 17% respectively due to abundant inventory and sluggish sales. Dried 菰 (gu), fir wood, and soybean cake also each fell by about 8%. Semi-finished products rose by 0.4%. The arrival of soybean oil was not smooth, and white factory yarn was purchased by foreign firms, causing its price to rise along with that of cotton yarn. Consumer goods rose by 3.1%. Except for green tea, which decreased in price due to sluggish sales, the prices of black tea, cigarettes, firewood, summer cloth, and carpets were stable, while the prices of other items all increased. Among them, almonds, flour, cotton cloth, eggs, and egg yolks experienced the largest increases.</p>
<p>(3) Import Price Index: The general index is 142.3, an increase of 1.6% compared to the previous month, and an increase of 15.0% compared to the same month last year. Compared to the previous month, all three categories of indices increased uniformly. Raw materials rose by 2.3%, due to the speculative rise in wheat prices and the increase in the prices of copper, lead, and tin following overseas markets. The semi-finished products index rose by 1.1%. Artificial silk, cut iron, ship steel plates, foreign silver dollars, white lead wire, purple copper sheets, and yellow brass sheets all experienced insufficient supply and brisk sales, leading to an upward trend in prices. Consumer goods rose by 1.5%. The overseas price of flour was high, and there were no recent transactions, so its speculative price rose along with the price of domestically produced flour. Due to the sales season for Tibetan cloth and Melton cloth, and poor harvests of American ginseng overseas, these items, along with feather silk, 1.6-foot velvet, brown sugar, pepper, bird's nests,麻袋 (ma dai), camel hair blankets, and other items, all remained firm.

<h3>River Rice Market Tightens Due to Rainy Weather</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, shipments from various districts totaled over fifty, amounting to approximately 11,500 to 11,600 shi. The market sentiment was upward due to the rainy weather, and sales in this area showed a slight improvement. Furthermore, wholesale merchants continued to purchase over 7,000 packages of Bo Dao and over 1,000 packages of Hou Geng. Consequently, the market situation tightened. As a result, Bo Dao prices rose by several jiao, while Hou Geng increased by one chi. Du Jian, being particularly scarce, saw a significant increase of 1.5 jiao. Yang Jian also rose by 1 jiao. Yin Bian Yuan, however, faced excessive supply, relying on the Geng market to maintain prices.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, shipments from the river regions were scarce. The weather was阴雨 (gloomy and rainy), and merchants reported tight supplies. Although the market sales were average, Xin Dao prices increased by several fen to 1 jiao. Early rice (Zao Dao) followed closely. Bo Dao prices remained firm. Yang Bu Du Jian prices rose by about 1 jiao, while Ke Jian also tightened by 6-7 fen. Yin Yuan supply was low, and prices were adequately raised. Bian Yuan saw balanced sales. The prices of all other types of rice generally showed a tightening trend.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Sees Trading of Over a Thousand Packages of Guangdong Coarse White Sugar</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trended towards stability. The guild set prices, and the spot and transit prices of 二四 (24) coarse sand white sugar, as well as 489 Dong Bai, remained unchanged. Mian Bai from this factory, Zhen Ji No. 1, was priced at 20.4 yuan. Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 5 were priced according to the retired grade. There were also several dozen packages of Jian Bang's continued Zhang Diao Qing purchases at a higher price of 12.2 yuan. Additionally, over thirty boxes of assorted white ice sugar were priced at 17.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The joint company held its second tender for Guangdong sugar this week, with a total fixed quota of 8,666 packages. The tender price remained unchanged. The company sold 755 packages of Shunde Factory's 五羊 (Five Rams) coarse white sugar at 21.3 yuan, and 110 packages from Shantou at 20.9 yuan. Shi Xin Factory's medium sand white sugar sold 180 packages at 19.3 yuan, totaling 1,045 packages.</p>
<h3>Northern and Southern Dried Black Dates Priced Higher than in Shanghai; Tianjin Red Dates Rise by About One Yuan; Glutinous Rice Market Price Declines</h3>
<p>Tianjin Red Dates: According to reports from the production area, the recent market has tightened, and prices have increased by about one yuan. Local merchant shipments have been around 600 to 700 packages daily. For example, Tianjin Red Date King is priced at 20 yuan, first-grade dates at 16-17 yuan to 14-15 yuan, first-household dates at 12-13-14-15 yuan, second-household dates at 11 yuan, and finally to 8.5 yuan. Assorted goods like Haozhou Red are priced at 8.5 to 8 yuan, and Fu Red at 7.3 to 6.9 yuan.</p>
<p>The production price of black dates has remained high for a long time, so local shipments are generally sold at a loss. Currently, first-grade dates from the north are priced at 31-32 yuan, first-grade Zhuang at 25-26 yuan, second-grade Zhuang at 21-22 yuan to 18-19 yuan, pointy dates at 16-17 yuan, complete dates at 14-15 yuan, and second-grade dates at 13 yuan to 12.5 yuan. First-grade dates from the south are priced at 19 yuan, high-grade Zhuang at 15-16 yuan, complete dates at 12-13 yuan, and second-grade dates at 12 yuan. Approximately one thousand packages were sold.</p>
<p>The sale of glutinous rice has slowed recently, and the market price has slightly loosened. Yesterday, it was heard that the high-grade market price from Tan Zhuang, previously 120 yuan, recently opened at 112 yuan, a decrease of about eight yuan. Regular rice was reduced accordingly.</p>
<h3>Dried Lily Bulbs Are in Demand in Guangdong</h3>
<p>Since the new crop of dried lily bulbs has been released, sales have gradually become active. Market prices, which were as low as 13 yuan at one point, have now reached 18 yuan, an increase of 4-5 yuan. The trend is stable and not likely to loosen easily, mainly because of the demand from Guangdong.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Considerable Transactions in Raw Silk Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the overseas silk market saw a slight rebound in both the U.S. and Japan (New York recently increased by one point, and Yokohama increased by nine yuan in the long-term). Market sentiment was more lively. The Chinese market seemed to have a downward trend in expectations and was selling off, so silk sales were relatively active yesterday. Bai Chang Jing's B-grade silk with 78 evenness and 80 evenness saw bulk transactions, but market prices have fallen by about 20 yuan compared to before. Yong Xing Su Na and other firms all absorbed a considerable amount, with a total of 400 packages traded. Other silk products totaled 44 packages. User sales remained unremarkable, but prices were relatively stable. Yesterday, local weaving factories imported a total of 45 packages, which was just a minor addition.</p>
<h3>Metals: 300 Boxes of Large-Sized Tinplate Ordered</h3>
<p>There is not much of 30-inch and 36-inch large-sized tinplate in the market, so many businesses are reordering from overseas. Yesterday, 300 boxes were ordered, with 24-gauge priced at 70 shillings per box and 26-gauge at 59 shillings per box. It is said that these were ordered by businesses around Broadway Road. As for Shanghai market prices, 24-gauge is sold at 90 yuan per box, and 26-gauge is sold at 78 yuan, an increase of one or two yuan compared to before. Yarn factories have been purchasing enthusiastically, and toy factories have also been buying some.</p>
<h3>Sales of Thick Tinplate Are Brisk</h3>
<p>Since the day before yesterday, thick tinplate has been in high demand in the market, so the market situation is very good. Prices have increased by several fen compared to before. For example, 22-gauge is sold at 4 jiao per pound, 24-gauge at 3.5 jiao, and 26-gauge and below are sold at 2.4 jiao. Customers are mostly purchasing 22-gauge and 24-gauge. A significant amount of 26-gauge, which is easy to oxidize, has also been sold. However, the inventory is quite thin.</p>
<h3>A Smile with Tears</h3>
<p>— Shi Ji</p>
<p>—How to Aid Suiyuan—</p>
<p>From the events of the past few days, we can see how the loyal and brave soldiers on the Suiyuan front have shouldered the glorious and sacred responsibility! In these few days, we can also see how the people all over the country have taken on the obligation of comforting and donating funds.</p>
<p>From this fact, we can see how the people and the brave soldiers on the front lines are connected for the sake of the survival of the motherland! We often hear people say that our national spirit is declining, and we also often hear people say that our soldiers are timid and avoid the enemy. But what are the facts replying in these few days?</p>
<p>We have also seen the soldiers who bravely faced difficulties during the Anti-Japanese War in Heilongjiang, the January 28 Incident, and the battle at Gubeikou, as well as the people who enthusiastically transported supplies. From this, we can be sure that as long as we fight to defend the motherland, not only will the soldiers do their best, but the people will also "respond from all mountains and follow the trend of the whole country" to support the soldiers who are fighting for the motherland.</p>
<p>Now, this "glorious encounter" is falling on the loyal and brave soldiers of Suiyuan. And the soldiers of Suiyuan have not failed this "glorious encounter." The battle records of these two days are certainly the best guarantee. In addition, let's look at the following: General Ge Xishan donated 870,000 yuan of inheritance on his mother's order. General Chuan Zuoyi, with "tears in his voice," said to his loyal subordinates in Pingdiquan: "This is a glorious encounter! Cowardice means death, evasion means death, only the brave will not die. I am willing to fight with the determination to die against those who invade the enemy and will not die!" General Li Fuying "moved his family from Gui Sui to Taolin to encourage the soldiers to swear to fight to the death." When we read such news from the many facts mentioned above, we cannot help but shed tears of gratitude and excitement.</p>
<p>However, the war in Suiyuan is not just a war for Suiyuan Province. From the "lessons learned" from the past, we also know that the result of a lone army fighting hard will inevitably lead to failure. Defending the country is the duty of soldiers, and we should launch the national army to aid Suiyuan "regardless of region"! We must know that if the lips are gone, the teeth will be cold. We are saving the country, not competing in the military field, waiting for one to be lost before another goes up. Even if we want to reward merit, we must look at the merits in the entire national salvation movement!</p>
<p>Secondly, we often see in the newspapers that enemy planes come to our positions to偵察 (reconnoiter) and bomb. Thanks to the bravery of the soldiers, we see news in today's newspaper that an enemy plane has been shot down. But in recent years, have our people not also donated many planes to the government? Where are our planes?</p>
<p>As for the people donating money to the soldiers on the front lines, that is naturally necessary, but what the soldiers on the front lines need more is medical supplies, gas masks, and cotton clothing! It has been snowing on the front lines these few days, but the soldiers' uniforms are quite thin. In the newspapers a few days ago, we learned that the enemy had transported many carloads of poison gas bombs. Although they have not been released yet, they will be released when they run out of tricks. At this time, gas masks are more important than anything else!</p>
<p>Since our donations are to help the loyal and brave soldiers swear to defend the territory, then why not donate gas masks, cotton clothing, and medical supplies and other items that are of more direct benefit to the soldiers?</p>
<p>Not to judge a gentleman with the heart of a villain, in order to prevent the fattening of those who harm the group, it is more appropriate to directly donate goods to the soldiers on the front lines. Naturally, in order to prevent problems before they occur, it is best to purchase the items that you think the front lines need most and then send them, so that even the middleman's commission can be saved.</p>
<p>And at present, saving one point of waste is increasing one point of national defense power.</p>

<h3>Qualifications</h3>
<p>— Fang Jie</p>
<p>Recently, people often judge others based on qualifications: Although this method is a bit rigid and inflexible, it is still popular. For example, A usually asks first: "Hey, what's ×××'s background?" B replies: "He's from ×× school!" Then C continues with "buzz buzz buzz..." It seems that after this three-part deductive argument, there will be no more regrets. As for the result, it has of course been subtly understood in C's "buzz buzz buzz..."</p>
<p>The origin of focusing on qualifications in China probably began in the Tang Dynasty; Before the Tang Dynasty, the responsibility of selecting talented officials rested solely with the Two Thousand Dan officials. Emperor Wen of the Han Dynasty's "Edict Seeking Distinguished Talents" also emphasized the recommendation of the Two Thousand Dan officials. Officials in charge of appointments had to carefully seek out whether there were any exemplary filial and incorrupt individuals in their territory who could be reported. And the literati and gentlemen were all honored by being recommended.</p>
<p>But after Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty established the imperial examination system, he opened a shortcut for officials to rise. Poor scholars kept their inkstones worn and inkwells dry, and as long as they passed the imperial examination, they didn't have to worry about anything; on the other hand, no matter how knowledgeable and well-versed you were, it would be difficult to stand out! Tang Shu:</p>
<p>"Luo Yin's literary reputation filled the world. An envoy from a foreign country entered the court. After returning home, his master asked him: Do you know Luo Zhaojian of Jiangdong? He said: I don't know him. The master was angry. Why don't you know him? He said: He's not on the list." (The general idea is like this, the original text is not very detailed)</p>
<p>Luo Yin's literary reputation was already known throughout the world, but because he lacked the qualification of being on the list, he was ultimately looked down upon by the foreign envoy. It can be seen that at this time, qualifications already had power.</p>
<p>This style was passed down to the Qing Dynasty, and it became even more prevalent, even becoming a decree. All those who did not come from the imperial examination system were not allowed to enter the cabinet—which further supported those with qualifications.</p>
<p>Although the imperial examination has been abolished now, qualifications are still essential for advancement. —Of course, special circumstances are not included in this example—Many people are not originally interested in studying: But in order to hunt for fame, they have to go abroad. After being gilded, although their bellies are rusty, they are still full of momentum!</p>
<p>Seeking office is like this, and love is no exception: elementary school marries middle school, middle school marries university, university marries overseas study: when overseas study has no one else to marry, then marry a minister - getting higher and higher!</p>
<p>People without qualifications, not to mention doing things, even women are not easy to deal with!</p>
<h3>Street Scene at Dusk</h3>
<p>— Lu Jia</p>
<p>Liaocheng Road, Linqing Road, Qingping Road, three parallel streets transplanted from the East.</p>
<p>Everywhere there are small Japanese-style Western buildings, the clattering wooden clogs on the cement sidewalks, the frequent deep bows of stooping old women, and the humble "Sayonara." People who take a walk here are almost doubtful of their nationality and the land they tread on.</p>
<p>The faint dusk, the light mist obscures the street lamps a little further away. The simple Japanese music and the lingering, beautiful voices of the Qingping Hall advanced dance hall diffused with the halo of the annual red lanterns. The small and exquisite dance hall architecture has a strangely novel shape: walls coated with silver powder, arc-shaped steel windows, matched with beautiful, eye-catching shop signs. It feels like it is only a building design that can be drawn on paper and admired, but it can really be transplanted to the ground. A string of elegant lamp shadows and the faint ink shadows of streetcars are lined up at the entrance.</p>
<p>Strolling along the sidewalk under the blue and white striped awning with a mood of admiration. Cafes, confectionery shops, and dance halls appear in various different harmonies of light and color with brand new postures. People seem to be flauntingly building shops one by one with various materials, even some with doors and windows.</p>
<p>Spreading on the pavement is the peculiar smell of Japanese shops, the fragrance of women's powder, and the mixed fragrance of flowers blooming in flower shops.</p>
<p>The shop windows are displaying colorful, elegant sundries, attracting many browsers with their novelty and ingenuity. So the wooden sliding doors slide frequently, some wooden exhibition steps into the mat-covered shop, and are sent out with bows and thanks, carrying large and small packages, and placed on the pavement at dusk—again doing a shop window appreciation and visit.</p>
<p>All around me are people of the same color and the same nationality, short statures wearing wide suits. The women combed their hair into tall buns; carried parasols, although they did not raise them: a thick layer of white powder covered their faces, necks, and exposed chests. Stepping past with hurried steps, the wide and long sleeves stirred up a fishy fragrance.</p>
<p>Turning into Qingping Road along two rows of neat street trees, red and green paper lanterns are faintly revealed in the tree shadows. There are signs for Japanese cuisine and Korean royal cuisine at each door. The street is not very wide, and the center of the street is paved with dim moonlight: the sidewalk is paved with the light of paper lanterns and the light leaking from the windows hung with peach-red curtains. Under the elegant light and shadows at each door are several women with brightly colored powder, using lustful eyes to capture the eyes of people who are curious and searching the street. A burst of low-grade teasing rises suddenly, the women laugh unrestrainedly, and the men blush and slip to the side streets.</p>
<p>Koreans and Japanese each occupy the front of their own doors, peeking at each other with contemptuous eyes. Those women who have forgotten the sorrow of national subjugation mostly wear plain silk shirts, exposing their chests to dazzle the flesh they have sold: the daughters of those who have conquered other people's countries do not have the glory of the motherland, and only have beautiful faces under the curled buns; light lips; clear eyes like pearls of the island nation: every night they stand at the door waiting for every night's new groom.</p>
<p>But under the quiet street lamp at the corner of the road, a deserted light blue plain silk lantern, there is a daughter wearing a well-fitting plain Western-style dress, leaning alone against the door frame and sitting on the stone steps, depicting a handsome posture, and no one comes to pay attention to her, just sits silently, sits.</p>
<p>Clearly in my own country, treading on my own land, but here I have the feeling of being a guest abroad, I can't help but lower my head and utter a dim sigh. (Sketch of Qingdao, one of them)</p>
<h3>Being Scolded</h3>
<p>— Ding Ni</p>
<p>Xiao Baiyan kept his hands busy finishing the shell of the cornucopia, feeling a little sore in his arms. He picked a finger with less paste and wiped his eyes, which had only had five hours of sleep, to see clearly that there was no sign of Huang Toumao in the shop. The thought "it's time to rest" ordered his hands to stop working. His legs, which were as stiff as iron, stepped onto the high stool, seeming to feel some comfort. The cigarette butt in his watch pocket was again held in the corner of his mouth.</p>
<p>Huang Toumao stepped into the shop, and Xiao Baiyan was too late to pinch out the cigarette butt.</p>
<p>Immediately, Xiao Baiyan's ancestors were cursed like chanting scriptures in Huang Toumao's not very thick lips.</p>
<p>"There is nothing in the world as lazy as you, a thing that works so slowly!"</p>
<p>"But I only have two hands!" He thought this, but didn't say it out loud.</p>
<p>If it were three years ago, Xiao Baiyan would have jumped up and cursed back: "I have plenty of strength, I won't starve to death if I don't eat your food."</p>
<p>With Xiao Baiyan's skills, everyone was indeed eager to have him three years ago. However, in recent years, it has been different. Once, when he angrily moved his bedding out of a paper shop, he almost starved to death in a small inn.</p>
<p>"Having strength doesn't necessarily mean you can exchange it for food!"</p>
<p>He understood this, and Huang Toumao's curses were like wind in his ears, not taken to heart at all.</p>
<p>Huang Toumao cursed for a while, seeing that Xiao Baiyan just lowered his head to paste paper! He also felt that the cursing was not right and sat down.</p>
<p>Maybe Huang Toumao's cursing was too loud, disturbing the landlady upstairs, who laboriously moved her one hundred and eighty pound body down from the second floor. The first sentence she said was:</p>
<p>"Boss Huang, where's the rent?</p>
<p>"I'm very sorry, I ran around for a long time, but I still couldn't borrow it. I can only ask you to give me a few more days..." Huang Toumao's face was full of smiles.</p>
<p>"You've owed three months' rent, and you still don't have it today. How can this be? I have to pay rent to my landlord too!" Coldly.</p>
<p>"It's really because business in the shop is not good..."</p>
<p>"I don't care what your business is like. Why be a boss if you can't afford to open a shop?" Saying this, she angrily and laboriously moved her one hundred and eighty pound body upstairs again.</p>
<p>Huang Toumao didn't say anything, and stared blankly at an orange. Then he jumped up again:</p>
<p>"It's all because of you, you pig, you idiot. As soon as you came, the shop became..."</p>
<p>Xiao Baiyan endured the scolding, without saying a word, just lowering his head to paste paper. He knew why he had to be scolded, and he got the answer from being scolded every day. Enduring scolding for a day is living for a day!</p>
<h3>Nostalgia for Hometown</h3>
<p>— Lan Pei</p>
<p>The stern of the boat rumbled and turned up milky white waves, the longer that pale white stripe on the blue sea, the farther the boat is from Java!</p>
<p>Nostalgia for hometown gently covers my heart.</p>
<p>Hometown, for me, has a poetic sentiment.</p>
<p>I love the blue sky there, I love the vast sugarcane fields with swaying leaves, I love the slender coconut trees that blow intoxicating melodies in the blue sky, in the clear wind, and in the moonlight.</p>
<p>Seashore, soft sandy beach. Gently put your feet on it, leaving clear footprints.</p>
<p>When you have collected half a bag of shells, tired, climb up to a large tree trunk, lay your limbs flat, looking at the distance, the place where the sky and water meet, a few white sails separate the blue sky and the blue sea. The wind is blowing softly too. You get tired, even: fall asleep.</p>
<p>There: morning and dusk bring you a lost intoxication!</p>
<p>Night - gentle tranquility!</p>
<p>Be careful! What do you see in the black pupils of the Malay women? Gentleness? Amorous feelings?</p>
<p>What about the simple and rustic Malay natives? That primitive, frank heart!</p>
<p>In my hometown: everything is a picture, Turgenev's prose poem.</p>
<p>I lean on the stern railing. My heart, along with the long and distant traces of the boat traveling to my hometown, returns all the way to my hometown!</p>

<h3>Old Yu's Son</h3>
<p>— Fei Xiangdong</p>
<p>It was on the Haiyuan steamship that I met an elderly man in his fifties, frail and thin. We were weary and lying in the stuffy and smelly steerage, occupying a space less than ten feet wide, spending our days together, enduring endless long days. Because the long days were boring: we started talking, and when we asked each other's names, he smoked a Ma Zhanshan brand cigarette and introduced himself like this.</p>
<p>"My name is Yu Jinfu - but in Singapore, people always call me Old Yu. I lived in Singapore for twenty years. At first, I was a shoemaker, and later I accumulated a little money and started my own shoe store. I only have one son, who was born to my wife who died more than ten years ago; this son is the lifeline of my life - he is now studying at Shanghai ×× University and is about to graduate."</p>
<p>"Then, you are going to Shanghai to see your son, right?" I interjected.</p>
<p>"Yes! We haven't seen each other for three years." He exhaled gray smoke, his two astringent eyes looking at it gradually fading away and remembering something, he suddenly fell silent.</p>
<p>The steerage was very noisy: people were walking around in the cabin, sometimes it was the burly sailors shouting at the passengers for some reason. Some other people were gathering to play poker, their voices were terribly noisy; not far away, that fat woman with two children, I don't know how she didn't take care of the younger one, and started crying loudly again.</p>
<p>You can't see the sky and the earth. Looking out from the porthole, it's a vast expanse of sea, monotonous enough to drive you crazy.</p>
<p>I didn't believe that Yu Jinfu could indifferently pass his days and nights here. Sometimes when he lay quietly next to his simple luggage, facing the yellow electric light, smoking a Ma Zhanshan cigarette, he always seemed to be thinking about something, spacing out at the smoke that came out of his mouth; sometimes he was very happy to tell me everything about his son and his expectations for him. This old man lived to have a son - and lived so excitedly!</p>
<p>"Just think, my son is no longer a shoemaker!" He said this, his eyebrows raised, "Eating with two hands is a painful thing: I have tasted enough of it myself. Now, as long as Xiao Fu becomes an adult and has ambition, can't I enjoy a few years of happiness?"</p>
<p>"Yes—" I responded, secretly anxious for him, because he valued his son too highly.</p>
<p>Yu Jinfu boasted about his son in front of me, until we arrived at the China Merchants Bureau Wharf in Shanghai, and we were each preparing to go ashore. He still kept talking about his Xiao Fu.</p>
<p>"Huh! Strange, why didn't Xiao Fu come to wait for the ship?"</p>
<p>"Did you write a letter to him?"</p>
<p>"Of course! I wrote it clearly, could it be that he—"</p>
<p>"Maybe he's busy with his studies and can't get away... Let's find a place to stay first and then talk."</p>
<p>The wharf was bustling, and hotel touts walked past us in various tones, soliciting passengers. Yu Jinfu seemed not to believe that his son would not come, so he didn't let his luggage be touched by the touts, and widened his eyes to look at the wharf.</p>
<p>But finally, he didn't come! This made Old Yu extremely disappointed, and gradually turned into dejection. As for me, I was about to part ways with him at this time. I had already handed my luggage to the hotel tout. In the noisy crowd, I shook hands with him and said goodbye and left.</p>
<p>More than a month later, I passed by this Haiyuan wheel companion Yu Jinfu on a street that was not very lively; he looked very thin, and his spirit was also very listless. I asked: "Did you find your son?" Unexpectedly, he shook his head at me and told me that Yu Xiaofu was suddenly pulled away from the dormitory one night two months before he arrived! Until now, he has not received any news...</p>

<p>Opening: "Lament"</p>
<p>Curved railings, curved walls. Winding and turning around the corridor. Walking to and fro through fragrant paths. A gust of wind brings a burst of fragrance. Butterflies flutter. Swallows pair. Branches and leaves cast shadows of weeping willows. Only to see the peach blossoms glowing brightly like brocade. Willow catkins flutter, wanting to dance wildly. And hear the iron horses jingle, the wind moving and sounding. Orioles sing clearly like the sound of a sheng. The curtain hook is not seen being rolled up layer upon layer. Lingering incense from Han Shou's perfume wafts from the burner. Thinking of myself, I am often lost in old hatred. Weary and drowsy, I am too lazy to embroider mandarin ducks. A jade comb does not tend to my silky hair. Precious time is wasted on a faint makeup. All day long, sitting alone in my boudoir, the sound is silent? Arousing, a weary illness in my bed. Then I call for more coal to be added to the burner, making a blazing fire. The maidservant is busy brewing medicinal soup. Only to hear the wind and rain beating against the window outside. The fox lamp dimly illuminates the long night of sorrow. Involuntarily, my heart is filled with right and wrong thoughts. Whispering to myself, secretly measuring. I remember, our past affections. I only hoped to be with my beloved, morning and evening. Unexpectedly, a boundless sea of ​​storms arose. Leaving me, alone, guarding an empty room. My every inch of intestine is cut off inch by inch. Longing, not seeing you, my tears are overflowing. From now on, the road is long and I cannot expect a message to arrive. Blood and tears stain, crying my heart out. I feel that the bitter rain is drizzling, sad and lonely. Sorrow belongs to the trembling strings, becoming desolate. Only the remaining lamp casts red beans. Quietly, the gauze curtain is pale and without light. Pity me, I hate myself for my thin life. Tears soaking through my silk dress. Look at the green grass in front of the courtyard, green year after year. Only hate that, strands of affection are not long lasting. Dreamy and vague, heating up yellow rice.</p>

<p>"Sai Jinhua" of "The Forties" to be performed tonight at the Jincheng Grand Theater</p>
<h3>From "Peach and Plum Calamity" to "United Hearts in Life and Death" - Remembering Chen Boer</h3>
<p>She is a woman who grew up in the South, and she has a considerable history in the Chinese drama scene. Mentioning her seems to conjure a kind of pure and new attitude in the impression, which is completely different from the generally popular female stars.</p>
<p>She was previously a student at China Public School, and her thoughts and knowledge are very advanced. She is a rare artist in the Chinese film industry.</p>
<p>The fame of "Peach and Plum Calamity" is well-known far and wide. It was her first achievement on the silver screen, and it still leaves an indelible mark on our minds. The filming of "United Hearts in Life and Death" by the new team of Star Film Company No. 2 is their second collaboration between the director and actors.</p>
<p>In "Peach and Plum Calamity," Boer is a weak woman, tormented and ultimately sacrificed in this evil environment. Her delicate acting skills have won the tears of sympathy from many audiences. In the recently completed "United Hearts in Life and Death," she plays a completely different kind of woman. Although gentleness and emotion are still her inherent characteristics, in this play, this characteristic has become something else. Emotion has not trapped her in the mire of general love, but due to a clearer understanding of this society, it has transformed into a greater love for mankind. She forgets the pain and sadness of losing her lover and strives for a more meaningful struggle in her career. This is a new type of woman, worthy of attention for the tens of millions of women who are wandering at the crossroads.</p>
<p>From "Peach and Plum Calamity" to "United Hearts in Life and Death" more than two years have passed. How have the status of Chinese women changed, and how have Chinese women progressed?</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Notes on "United Hearts in Life and Death"</h3>
<p>It is a precious historical work, but there are no names of historical figures. But this is even more valuable, because it transcends the artistic value of an ordinary film work. It reflects a certain social dynamic, reflects a certain era of storms, and it has such a higher social value.</p>
<p>Look, this is another side of the life of young men and women. Prisons, tens of millions of people are released from here and go back in from here. Long years are destroyed like their precious youth. What is this? Smart audiences, figure it out for yourselves.</p>
<p>We have seen "The Fugitive", we have seen "Twenty Thousand Years in Prison". The laws and order of a certain era, Chinese and foreign, are the same. This "United Hearts in Life and Death" depicts a story that often occurred under the rule of warlords.</p>
<p>The handling of several prison scenes by director Ying Yunwei has the style of "The Fugitive," which is rare in Chinese films.</p>
<h3>"Soaring Ambition"</h3>
<p>A Play Full of Rugged Atmosphere</p>
<p>The tragic and passionate epic "Soaring Ambition", written and directed by Wu Yonggang, stars the couple Jin Yan and Gan Renmei. Although they both have extremely high reputations in the Chinese film industry, this is their first collaboration together. Of course, with their past achievements, plus "Soaring Ambition" is originally a play full of rugged atmosphere and fighting spirit, it is expected to have an amazing contribution. At the same time, in order to make this play perfect, Xinhua authorities have also decided to invest a large amount of money in its production. The grand event of sending a large team to Zhengzhou for outdoor scenes is a clear proof.</p>
