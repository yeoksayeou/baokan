<h3>弱小民族反帝運動之現勢</h3>
<p>— 紀</p>
<p>自意阿戰爭爆發以來國際關係之縱橫離合可謂極盡其變幻之能事矣舉例言之如英法之聯合德國回復殖民地之遠動日本要求英國開放東方市塲之呼聲廣田倡議美日平分太平洋之傳說以及最近英前工黨領袖藍斯堡氏在下院中提出重新分配世界資源之建議等等皆爲國際關係上之新事態此種微妙複雜之國際情勢一言以蔽之卽殖民地半殖民地之獨佔勢力與再分割運動之矛盾是也</p>
<p>此種矛盾深刻化所發生之影響在一方面爲宗主國對其殖民地控制勢力之增厚在另一方面則爲弱小民族以不堪受其宗主國之經濟的及超經濟的高度榨取而猛烈進展其獨立運動故意阿戰爭一擴大英國對菲洲殖民地之警戒綫一鞏固埃及民族之反英卽因而高漲風聲所播弱小民族之要求解放運動幾如雨後春筍一發而不可復遏矣</p>
<p>據最近國民社電傳法委任統治地敘利亞今日發生猛烈之反法風潮敘利亞國會議長會致電國聯及法外部抗議當局用高壓手段致釀成流血案件同時伊拉克國會議員五十人亦聯名致抗議書於國聯委任統治官謂「敘利亞現在一切糾紛法國政策應尸其咎」此外與敘利亞伊拉克毘鄰之巴力斯坦及托蘭斯約丹因受民族獨立運動之影響亦思起而組織汎阿拉伯國聞英國對此已感非常憂慮</p>
<p>在南美洲方面則智力有罷工之騷動而巴西阿根廷烏拉圭秘魯哥倫比亞愛瓜多諸國亦有同樣之不穩現象吾人與世界各弱小民族處於同一之立塲對彼等自表無限之同情而民族運動浪潮之激盪亦可给国人以正確之認識與奮發之勇氣所謂正確之認識者卽　現階段之民族運動已進於普遍聯合進行之前夜而有超國界之性質存乎其間　現今弱小民族國內之一切糾紛皆有支配權益關係之諸帝國主義國家本身所促成者　在帝國主義國家對弱小民族之關係十所謂「互惠」所謂「援助」與「合作」不過其虛僞之幌子而已明乎此吾人可知我民族生存之基本條件爲如何脫離帝國主義之桎梏非此不足以言國運之進展與民族之復興非此亦不足以使國家臻於安定也</p>
<h3>有吉對日外務省當局　建議統一對華方針　一切交涉應出之互相信賴　召開南京會議謂待我通知</h3>
<p>東京　駐華大使有吉明、十二日下午、在外務省會見新任大使有田八郎·重光次官·桑島東亞局長·天羽情報部長等、對日政府從來對華方針、盡量加以批評後、表示如次意見、以資政府樹立新方針之參考、</p>
<p>「日本國內對於蔣介石對日態度、有種種批評、然據余觀察、蔣氏認真努力調整中日關係、日本從來對華方針、缺乏統一、國內意見、亦不無區區分別之狀、如此方針及意見、須要根本的加以改革、中國政府以認真態度、正欲開始中日關係調整交涉之際、日本亦統一對華國論、以一貫的外交方針、應付今後一切交涉、是絕對必要、」</p>
<p>有吉大使、根基於其在過去三年半間駐華經驗、主張外交方針之統一後、由全體人員、關於華北·滿洲·蒙古問題、交換意見之結果、决定方針如下、</p>
<p>調整中日國交、除依據兩國互相信賴與友誼的精神之外、無其他方法、日本應以統一的國策、實行對華外交、</p>
<p>中日兩國互相提携親善、確立所謂三原則至爲必要、以廣田外相在本期議會演說之三原則、爲對全世界之外交方式、</p>

<h3>美國眾院　通過陸軍預算</h3>
<p>額數為和平時最大</p>
<p>華盛頓　衆院今日以二〇四票對三六票通過五四五·二六六·〇〇〇元之陸軍預算案、（十四日國民電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　陸軍剖前向衆議院提出一九三六—三七年度軍事預算案、共爲五五八·〇二七·〇二九元、其中包括陸軍所需經費三九〇·六六七·〇三三元、太平洋沿岸巴拿馬運河及檀香山海防設略、所需經費八。五〇〇·〇〇〇元、暨軍用飛機五百六十五架、購致費四五·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、昨經衆議院表决通過後、頃已咨送參議院、按承平時代美國軍事預算案、當以此次爲最大、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>英設國防部案</h3>
<p>保守黨議員撤回提案</p>
<p>倫敦　保守黨下議員蘇德爵士、提議將陸海空三部合併爲國防部、頃由下院加以討論、不管部大臣潘西勛爵、以政府名義、要求吾决此案、謂內閣自當調整陸海空軍務、使合作精神、更臻密切、合併一舉、無此必要云云、結果由蘇德爵士自行撤回提案、討論之際、前外相奧斯丁張伯倫發表演說、主張內閣當設不管部大臣一員、主持國防委員會之事務、謂就渠觀察所得結論、首相職務繁重、在目前情形之下、對於帝國國防委員會主席一職、實已不能兼顧、吾則勢難措置裕如、去年五月二十二日下議院討論德國空軍之時、首相（時任樞密大臣）自認對於德國空軍之未來力量、估計完全舛誤、迨去年十二月間、首相對於意阿爭端解决方案、卽賴伐爾霍爾二人所擬之案、亦復自認失着、鮑爾溫自知謬誤、向下議院請求恕諒、已有兩次、吾人務當竭盡方法、田令此種謬誤、再度發生也」云云、（十四日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　某議員提出議案、主張創設國防部、其部長以調整陸海空軍工作爲職責、今日下院曾辯論該案、惟二讀通過之動議、徇從政府與奧斯汀張伯倫爵士（一九二四年十一月至一九二九年六月曾長外部）之請而撤回、當討論之際、發見各黨許多要員熱切贊助該案、或該案之修正式、提出動議者、爲保守黨議員海軍少將蘇特氏、蘇特氏極言天空攻擊之重要、謂天空擲下之炸彈、漸成主要利器、政府急宜從事試騐天空炸彈對戰艦彼此之關係、海軍部當撥一舊戰艦、設法使之不沉、而後由航空員自天空轟擊之、以爲試騐、蘇特氏殊不以高射砲能制止飛機轟擊軍艦爲然、又謂自治領均應參加國防部云、繼蘇特氏發言者、均謂調整海陸空軍之工作、每年可節省金錢數百萬鎊、而可得更佳之役務、帝國防務委員會迄未能應付此種局勢云、不管部閱員裴西勳爵代表政府作答、謂中間須有預備之工作、卽　各別之行政部須商定一共同方針、而相聯合、然後呈請首相裁决、　根據各部在一行政領袖下實行行政的統一之合作而定一計畫、政府對於該問題一時不能發表意見、惟內閣自當注重此事、請下院暫勿表决該案、於是奧斯汀張伯倫爵士繼起演說、亦勸下院靜待政府之建議、爵士並從事打銷一般人士評詆、首相鮑爾溫近今所發關於德國重整軍備與其他國際軍事局勢之宣言、謂此種評詆、實根據於謬誤之情報、並謂就此種言論觀之、今實宜作大改革、以免續有此種謬見云、（十四日路透社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　前外相奧斯汀張伯倫、昨在下院所發之言論、雖使創立國防部之議員提案、二讀撤回、然已引起國人多大之注意、蓋其言之主旨、在要求較新而較有效率之國防組織制度、而非對於首相包爾溫加以抨擊也、奧斯汀張伯倫此項要求、確爲人贊助、觀咋日下院之辯論、下院之不滿於現有的國防組織、已可顯見、目前確有創立國防部之眞正要求、但此國防部、須具調整海陸空三軍工作之權力、而隸於能專任其事之一個部長之下、此種見解、爲許多方面所同具、故政府不久必設法製新辦法、（十五日路透電）</p>
<h3>法國革新空軍</h3>

<h3>國聯對意禁油</h3>
<p>無期延緩　促進和議</p>
<p>倫敦　本社訪員頃由英國外交界方面探悉、對意禁運煤油辦法、顯有無期展延之勢、因此英國人士、均以爲對於意阿兩國議和問題、務當從新進行談判、卽一向主張實施禁運煤油者、現亦羣作此說、又意國人士亦謂、和平談判、卽將開始、凡此雖皆言之過早、要亦足以證明一般人士、均認意阿爭端妨害歐洲和平、故亟欲予以了結也、此外英國負責人士聲稱、國聯會行政院五國委員會、（卽英。法。波蘭。土耳其。及西班牙所組織）、曾於去年九月十五日提出解决意阿爭端之建議、當時意國雖於九月二十五日加以拒絕、但該國復文中、曾謂若以國聯會委任統治制之原則爲基礎、則或有進行談判之可能、似亦不無伸縮餘地、因此上項建議、不妨從新加以考慮也、按之外務部方面、最近所接消息、阿國軍火、漸感匱乏、意國受經濟制裁之影響、亦日漸加劇、此或亦可使兩國態度轉趨緩和云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>羅馬　國聯會禁運媒油開題專家委員會、前曾估計意國現所屯儲之煤油爲一百萬噸、頃據此間半官方面宣稱、國內屯儲油量、實際上遠不止此數、惟確數若干、未經言明、又專家委員會在技術上討論禁運煤油問題、工作迅速、瞬已　事、半官方面甚爲詫異、一般人相信專家委員會之所以迅速將事者、蓋欲使美國參衆兩院外交委員會、聞風嚮應、對於煤油出口問題有所决定也、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>四國海軍會議　主艦噸位案又僵持</h3>
<p>美巨艦主義不允條件限制　英對法聲明措辭亦甚籠統</p>
<p>倫敦　海軍會議現行局勢、頗多周折、主要問題、如主力艦噸位、與邀請德國對於未來恊定簽字參加兩項問題、自上星期二日以來、迄未有所進展、此間海軍界人士、在上星期一日晚間、雖以爲英法意美四國、已有成立恊定之希望、但法美兩國代表旣未互相接觸、而英國代表團關於會議前途之聲明、亦復　統其詞、一般人印象、遂以為海軍會議當可圓滿結果、　實則法意兩國主張者、乃在下述兩項條件之下、成立協定、　卽四國協定成立之後、始以之送達德國暨其他各國、請其分別簽字參加、　卽英美兩國得建造三萬五千噸主力艦兩艘、一俟協定六年期滿之後、此項噸位卽當予以减低、此在美國、實際上僅允日後加以考慮、從未應允立卽履行、迨外間誤傳四國海軍恊定、已於上星期二日成立之後、法意兩國當卽表示異議、因而雙方意見相左、眞實情形、暴露無餘、要之、關於主力艦噸位問題、美國始終不允减至三萬五千噸以下、法國在此種情形之下、遂乃拒絕繼續討論、加之英意兩國代表昨日一度會晤之後、業已證明意國對於法國見解、允其是關於主力艦噸位一項問題、仍加以贊助、海會前途、因而益　棘手、此外、法　國駐英大使戈爾平、與意國海軍少將皮西亞先後返國、亦足見海會形勢、殊難使人樂觀云、十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　據本社訪員所知、海軍會議因各關係國對於主力艦噸位問題、迄未獲得妥協、行將宣吿結束、法國駐英大使戈爾平、意國海軍少將皮西亞、先後返國述職、其用意乃向各該國政府報吿主力艦噸位問題、現行討論基礎、以便决定各該兩國在此項基礎上、是吾有退出會議之必要云、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　法國駐英大使戈爾平、本日曾與外相　登舉行長時間談話、旋於午後　四時啟程返國、以海軍會議最近發民情形、報吿該國外交部長佛蘭亭、並以法國代表團今後應採之步驟、請示於外長、英法兩國人士、對於戈爾平此行、均不贊一詞、惟據海軍會議方面所知、英法兩國最近談話所討論者、不僅爲質的限制問題、（指主力艦噸位問題）、卽未來協定、由德國簽字參加問題卽引起之政治問題、亦曾加以研究、此戈爾平所以有返國請示之必要也、現知戈氏將於下星期二日返此、海會談判、當於是時始能賡續切實進行云、（十四日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　海軍會議因主力艦噸位問題、延未解决、殆又陷入僵局、會內人員、甚至以爲下星期中會議或有完全失敗之可能、緣美國主張以三萬五千噸爲中力艦噸位之限額、不允减低、此在法意兩國、則認爲與海軍會議减縮軍備之本旨相背、拒不接受、法國雖允讓步、對於三萬五千噸以下之數字、準備加以考慮、但美國方面、始終堅持前說、至於英國、則僅對於主力艦砲口徑、提出折衷方案、卽由十六英寸减至十四英寸、（此層本年年底華府海的滿期以後、卽可實現、惟須以日本接受爲條件耳）、惟英國此項建議、旣於噸位無涉、自不足以挽救僵局也、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>蘇俄報紙評　法俄互援公約</h3>
<p>謂足保障世界和平</p>
<p>莫斯科　伊斯維斯太報社論謂、法國政府不顧德國報紙之無禮表示、德國卽將吾認羅加諾條的、已向國會提議批准法蘇互助公的、日本軍部報紙、對於法蘇公的、同抱敵視態度、最近「滿」蘇「滿」蒙邊境事件、亦顯與日本軍部意圖供給公的之敵、以蘇聯不足恃之證據、卽謂蘇聯已被遠東緊急情勢所牽制、已無充分力量保衛西方和平、德國法西主義之瘋狂、及日本軍部之行動、最足以證明法蘇公的、對於鞏固世界和平、俱有重大意義、法國一雖最關心保持和平、但亦有人反對法蘇互助公的、似可駭異、吾人必須重視、德一國法西斯蒂反對法蘇互助公的宣言、影　法國右翼份子、而法國右翼份子之反一對公的、又被德國法西斯蒂用作脅迫法一國政界、阻其批准公的之另一理由、該報，否認右翼份子所謂、締結公約乃由蘇聯一提議、謂此公的之提議締結、須歸功於巴一爾都氏、「蘇聯政府應允巴爾都之提議、一非因蘇聯不能以自己武力防衛邊境、吾人乃如斯丹林及莫洛托夫兩領袖在第十一七决共黨大會所言、首先依賴自己武力、鞏固國防、以抗任何强啟、但吾人雖能、且須以自己武力防衛蘇聯邊境、吾人不能僅恃己力保全和平、因此聯合維持和平之各大强國、乃屬必要、因意圖再分割世界之列强、僅此和平大聯合能使彼等感覺重大危險、在其實行侵略之前、促其反省也、法國與蘇聯並不願意締結任何列强集團、彼等曾邀全體列强參加和平組織、但德國及波蘭之拒絕參加互助公的、使法國與捷克祇能各自與蘇聯締結互助公的、德國法西主義攻繫互助公的、此乃打擊法蘇兩國鞏固和平政策最重要之政治步驟、法國之反對此項公的者、實助德國法西主義達其目的、法國議會、對於公的問題之决議、足以左右歐洲集體安全之命運、唯有批准公約、能使準備戰爭者、知尙有若干勢力、準備保障和平、且决不易使其分散、過去數年、事實證明國聯盟的第十六條如無互助公的、僅一具文、希望法國議會瞭解法國及隣近其他歐洲國家之安全、將繫於彼等之决議」、（十五日塔斯電）</p>

<p>華盛頓　此間通貨專家以爲美國向華購大批白銀之後、美國在世界通貨鬥戰中已獲得亞洲方面之有力同盟、同時中國通貨亦將與美元發生連繫、因中國在紐的旣有三二、〇〇〇、〇〇〇元之存欵、已可於一長時期中穩定其通貨對美元之匯率也、中國雖在倫敦亦有同樣存欵、但未能制止此間通貨專家之欣慰、由彼等視之、此舉已使中國在美元英鎊之間、保持兩不偏袒之形勢、由是而使中國通貨完全與美元發生連繫亦意中事、此間一般戚想、以爲目前美國所以欲操縱世界之匯兌與貿易者、以有二十餘國家與之作貨幣合作耳、唯於此種通貨戰爭中、中國苟能與美元發生述繫或拒絕加入英鎊集團、則以美國二十萬萬元之平準基金、平衡美國之國際收支、當能綽乎有餘也、（十四日國民電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　商界方面今日以爲中國向美國財部出售白銀而得之美金爲數甚巨、故南京政府儘可以其中之一部在美國購買鐵路或其他材料、但消息靈通方面以爲倘使中國對美貿易如能保持其最近期間之出超傾向、則中國殊無動用此筆美金之必要、（十四日國民電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　美聯社記者今日得悉、美國現正設法穩定中國之金融、蓋以美國往日購買中國大批白銀、幾使中國金融制度瀕於破產、今後應稍盡其扶持之誼也、財長毛根韜亦西願中國通貨與世界市塲之關係趨於安定、（十四日國民電）</p>

<p>德國白萊門經濟部長沙赫特博士、頃爲此間經濟協會行開幕禮、並發表演說、謂「吾人務當設法增加出口數額、不可或緩、蓋惟出口增加之後、吾人所需要之原料、始能源源輸入反之、若將幣價貶低、則吾人所需要之脂肪。棉花。以及金屬品、卽無從購買矣、總之吾人現當解决者、非金錢問題、而爲貨物問題、惟有堅苦工作、撙節度日、則前途始有光明之一日」云云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>特載</p>
<h3>國亟應舉辦之　生物調查與研究事業（續）</h3>
<p>— 胡先</p>
<p>關於團藝植物之研究</p>
<p>園藝之範圍極大。大要包括果樹，蔬菜，花卉，三大類。吾國果業，雖相當發達；然較之歐美與日本，相去遠甚。如夏熟柑橘與西洋櫻桃之待栽培，即其例也。此外外國所產名果之可以輸入者，種類不少；而吾國野生果品，亦有多種，可以改良。如獮猴桃及各種懸鈞子，即其著例。現在中央農業試騐所，以其事業之偉大，與人力財力之缺乏，無暇硏究及此，實則亦宜重視者也。蔬菜園藝硏究，在吾國當無特別重視之必要；而花卉園藝之硏究，則宜極力提創者。吾國地處溫帶，植物種類之多，爲世界溫帶區域之冠。名葩異卉。種類允多。至有花國之稱。每年歐美各大植物或園藝機關，派遣專家來吾國採集植物及輸入種子者，絡繹不絕。如社鵑花一屬，全世界產五百餘種，而三百餘種產自中國。他屬稱是故在歐美有無中國產花卉不成園庭之說。而中國自身，及墨守昔時所栽植之各品種。自海通以來，則競栽植外國之花卉，甚至國產之品種，亦轉假手於外人，以重行輸入之。英國某科學家常言，以中國人工之賤，卉木種類之繁，若在長江流域，大規模作花卉與蔬菜之育種，可以壟斷世界之種苗業。同時外國之名葩異卉，未經輸入栽培者，爲數亦夥。然今日國內園藝家，寥若晨星，繁植專家，全國不過二三人。今幸廬山森林植物園，有廣大之面積，而極幹練之技術家，主持其事。政府亟宜與以資助，不難使之步英國邱皇家植物園之後　，發達爲東亞第一植物　也。</p>
<p>關於藥用植物之硏究</p>
<p>中國以植物種類之多，故先民對於藥物硏究極早，而特產之良藥，亦極豐富。徒以本經科學整理，故不爲操新醫業者所信任。吾國每年入口之生藥，價至六千萬元；而如大黃甘草之類，本爲中國土產，徒以無藥廠製造，與科學方法檢定，外人以一轉手之勞，而朘削吾人不少。他如附子龍膽遠志之類，中國所產，與歐美所產者種類雖不同，而效用則相若。但未經研究而標凖化，遂爲新醫所擯而不用。至如麻黃已經恊和醫學校之研究，而成世界之聖藥，而黨參川芎黨歸半夏諸藥材，疊經科學家硏究，而其效用以著。惟未經硏究之藥尙夥。今日硏究中國藥物，最感覺之困難，在鑑別其種類。蓋中國藥物種類極多，如龍膽有一百餘種，附子亦有七餘種，究竟市上所賣者係何品種？若無植物學家山栽培新鮮之品種入手以硏究之，藥物學家與化學家終無法判定其品種，與其所硏究之結果不能確定，無由以大規模精製之。只有由植物學硏究機關，聘請藥學專家，會同採集栽培，而硏究之，方能得精確之效果也。（未完）</p>

<p>中學的課程，早就列有外國史，但是大家一向都不甚重視道門功課。學生自以爲拿一本西史敎科書開開來，個僩字都認得，就說牠容易，看牠不起。辦學校的人也以爲道項功課的價値，遠在英文算學之下，於是按照錡點算起薪水來，敎歷史的人，老是拿的錢比算學英文敎員少。還有許多校長，甚至把外國史的鐘點，當做人情，隨便分給旁的敎職員兼任，以作他們的津貼。六年前，曾有某大學的一位預科主任，公開的對學生說：「西洋史値得學嗎！那華盛頓，拿破崙，誰不知道，」？這樣的些人主持學校，當然不曾請一個對於外國史有研究的人，去敎西洋史，更絕對不會想法子，去提倡學生讀外國史的興趣。於是乎中學的外國史，竟完全等於虛設。</p>
<p>近幾年來，這種情形，在學校裏稍爲好點。然而社會上仍有不少的人，對於中學講外國史的事情，加以非難。歸納他們的現論，約有三種：一是說：「外國人的長處，是自然科學；我們缺的，也正是自然科學。我們學外國的科學，便可救國。至若外國史，是人家過去的事跡，與我們無關。學了牠，旣不能富國强兵，又不足以爲謀生之具，白費光陰，有何用處？」另一種人說：「歷史之學，浩若烟海。我們自己的一部二十叫史，尙不知從何處下手，那裏還有閒工夫去學習人家的歷史？現在中學的課程，巳經是特別繁多，學生整天的念英文習算學，尙覺時間不够，再要他們去學外國史，豈不是不明輕重緩急，白苦學生嗎！那外國史，是應該讓少數的有閒階級，在大學裏去作專門研究，靑年的中學生，實在不必管牠了。另有一種人說：「物質文明，是無分中外，人人都可利用的，所以我們應當學取外人的長處。至若精神文化，各種民族不可强同·硬學人家，終是畫虎不成。我們復興民族，須要從自己的歷史裹面找一條路出來，纔能够發揚國光。那舶來的種種思想主義，不合國情，學牠是不惟無益，而且有害的。外國史中充滿這種不合中國國情的學說事實，那還可以讓判斷力未完全發達的中學生學嗎！」</p>
<p>作道三種主張的人，大半以前都住過中學，當然也曾經學過外國史。他們現在有這樣的議論，更可以證明從前中學裹面外國史的課程確是全未收效了。不過這不是外國史的本身不好，實在是學外國史未得法的結果，這是應該由敎學的人自己負責的！猶之乎銳本是養人之物，然而煮的不好，也可以吃了病人，那應當改良煮的法子，不能說就永遠把飯不吃了。</p>
<p>作第一種論調的人，是山於不知道外國史的價値。持第二種全張的人，是沒有弄淸中學裏面外國歷史踝程的內容。發第三種議論的人，是不曉得中學生學外國史應用的方法。知道外國史的眞正價値，自然會利用牠。明白外國史的內容，自然會選擇材料，學得亳不吃虧。曉得學外國史的方法，自然只會得益，不至受害。所以我現在要解釋這三種誤會，以免中學生對於外國史科目懷疑。同時也就把外國史在中等敎育上的價値，同中學生應學的範圑，合學牠的方法，略講一講。希望各中學的同學們可以藉此增加你們學外國史的興趣。</p>
<p>第一派的人，主張科學救國，那是極對的。但若是說中國現在所要的只是自然科學，並沒有其他的東西，那就大錯而特錯了！今日的科學，差不多都是發源於希臘，那麼希臘人爲甚不能利用他們的科學思想去改進他們的物質環境咧？中國人早就發明了指南針，渾天儀，早就知道造紙印書，爲甚麼到現在物質文明還是道樣落伍咧？歐洲大陸，在十八世紀的時候，出了不少的科學家，爲甚麽產業革命還發生在英國之後咧？可見得單靠幾個科學大家，還是不能够普及科學，單有幾件科學上的發明，仍然是强不了國，富不了民的。要是人民沒有運用科學的精神，社會沒有發展科學的組織，科學是永不會發達的。縱學得一點皮毛，也無用處。從前北洋海軍的外表，比當時的日本兵船還堂皇些好看些，然而打起仗來，終是一敗塗地那甲午戰敗的責任，難道該歸常時的海軍獨負嗎？飛機同高射礮，在歐戰中，早經用過，而直至一二八的時候，中國人還要鼓吹甚麽飛箭飛雷。你想在這種飛箭救國，大刀救國的空氣之中，科學還有發展之望嗎！我們現在若眞想拿外國的科學來救國，第一先得去掉這極不科學的心理，養成那追求眞理的精神；第二得造成一種能够應用科學的社會，培養一種適宜於科學發展的環境。然而道些先决條件，都不是科學的本身可以解决的。我們須得研究人家的歷史，看他們的科學文化，是這樣成功的，一步一步照樣做去，綫可有望。所以靑年學生一方面固然要學數學理化，以爲將來學高深科學的預備，一方面却得學外國史，以改革我們不科學的傳統思想，養成同外國人一樣的科學精神。</p>
<p>再進一步說，不懂得社會科學的人，是見解狹隘，不能充分利用自然科學的。所以西洋人，無論學醫也好，學工也好，先都得受一種注重歷史的　自由敎育」，好去擴大他的見解，培養他的鑑別力。沒有世界常識的科學專家，外國是沒有的。現在國內研究科學的人，學問淵博的，固然很多。但是常識缺乏的，也還不免。我曾經遇着一位造船的工程師，他硬說印度人是　種；見過一位醫學博士，他硬說意大利是木梭林立纔統一的；又見過一位學駕駛飛機的，他硬說日本立國的精神，是英國一樣。這幾位先生的專門技術，都很不錯，但是憑他們這樣的常識，就能够充分利用科學來救國嗎？我們現在需要的是明瞭世界大勢的科學家，不是那替物質作奴隸的機器匠。機器匠固然也有用處，但是把中學生都造成機器匠，那還成個國家嗎？諸位若是想做個超機器匠而上之的科學家，就非對於社會科學有根柢不可。世界史在社會科學中，佔最重要的地位，那是不用說的了。</p>
<p>這所說的，都是外國史在學術上的價値。現在要再談牠更大的用處，我們讀書的目的，不僅在求知，還要培養人格，陶冶性靈，換句話說，就是學做一個完人。本來任何學問，談到頂高深的地步，都可用爲進德之資。但這不是一般初學的靑年所能領會到的。因爲靑年的心理，不喜歡那抽象的，迂曲的，奧妙的，玄秘的理論。最好是給他一個具體的榜樣，他便一見心服，潛移默化了。這樣說來，　　　　外國史在內——豈不是陶鎔靑年最有　　　　嗎？因爲：第一，牠的內容多是勸善懲過的記載，可以做我們觀摩砥礪的材料。我們知道聖賢豪傑忠臣義士的言行，便自然會心響往之；領會種種民族運動，社會運動的眞精神，便自然意氣激昻，想奮發有爲。大凡事業學術特別成功的人，生平總　選擇一個偉大的古人，作他理想上的標準，念茲在茲，亦步亦驅，久而久之，自然德業日進了。第二，歷史的目的，是在追求眞理。牠的方法，是客觀的，比較的，分析的，　納的。牠的　論，是合乎理性的；牠的判斷，是絕對　輯的。我們要善於讀史，就自然可以養成那觀察精密，分析淸楚的習慣；那注重客觀，去除我見的心理；同那不長威禮，一本理智的態度。處世做人，都能如此，那還不是特立獨行之士嗎？所以德國的雷新（Lessing）說「歷史是人類的敎育，是人文敎育的基礎」。這位先生，並不是個專鬥史學家，他的話，當然不是偏袒麽史，阿其所好的。（未完）</p>

<h3>塞漠生活考察記　（三）</h3>
<p>— 金兌</p>
<p>四.西藏人民的衣食住</p>
<p>在青海時候的我們因爲想要深入康藏，不得不到西陲宣化使公署去請給護照。探知職授西陲宣化使的護國宣化廣衛大量班禪額爾德尼，駐節在離西寗五十里外的塔稱寺。於是，雇了騾車，在雪地旅行了一整天纔到目的地，時間已是月出東山的黃昏後，便歇突在宣化公署無線電分台的職員住舍。這是一所寺院的側屋，前面中間的右列住着宣傳科的科長汪德君，是一位西藏青年，却操着滿口很流利的北方話，據說以前曾山西軍官學校念書，班禪大量在京時他也追隨着。如果他不穿上束了腰的藏服，你可看不出他是道地的西藏人。晚飯後，因爲曉得明天謁見佛爺的通事（繙繹）就由汪科長担任，所以事前先到他那裏會談，好作禮儀上和一切手續的凖備，順便也訪問一下班禪入藏的情況和西藏的風土習尚，蒙他從衣食住方面告訴我很多，關於西藏社會生活的概況：</p>
<p>甲衣的方面　西藏喇嘛最高階級，即達賴喇嘛跟班禪喇嘛的衣服，分內外兩種，內衣用（西藏織造的特産之一種）製成，外衣穿紫色羊絨造的單衫。鞋有兩種，錦鞋和華履。帽子分冬夏兩種，冬天多戴黃色的尖頂帽，以氆氌羊絨製成。夏帽形如竹笠，用金色皮製。喇嘛的階級極嚴，所以衣服形式，雖然大致差不多，可是表裏精粗却頗有分別。</p>
<p>官員有所謂葛布倫，戴棒。第巴等名位。當令節或臨政進，頭戴　白紗帽，身披大領窄袖的綠錦短衣，衣沿綴以獺皮，圍穿黑褐白褶裙，足登白軟底華履，肩罩紅褐單，腰間佩刀，束大紅花緞帶。</p>
<p>自噶布倫以下至於一般民衆，都佩骨玦，平民者都着大領的密縫無衩的褚巴，腰部束皮或毛褐帶等物，至於平民的內外衣，却和中等階級的喇嘛大略一樣。</p>
<p>至於婦女，頭戴　尖頂上帽，多取綠色，脚穿錦鞋或布鞋，上衣着小袖的短衫，下身着黑紅褐的裙子，外披絨小方單，頭上縣一兩串念珠，不拘貧富都有的。定有的戴　珍珠冠，冠上綴着寶石珍珠等貴重飾物。老婦額上戴　一征鏡子似的綠松石，用金鑲好。婦女們的鬢髪，兩邊分撥，像一般繩子那樣束着，拖隨腦後。未出嫁的少女，腦後分一辮，辮上插了寶石珊瑚等首飾，已出嫁的女人，辮髪也一樣，不過將男聘禮中的飾物，戴　在頭上，表示已經有了丈夫。</p>
<p>乙食的方面，藏民日常食料，以糌粑爲主。藏地有一種植物，名呌青果，是麥的一類，色紫黑，顆粒比小麥稍大，而中含高蛋白和澱粉等養料，較尤多，等體積青果較等體積小麥爲強。將青稞用水洗淨，曬幹熟，磨成細粉，和以酥油，捏成拳形，就呌糌耙，（漢人喚做五道箍點心）。糌耙的食法很方便，最宜旅行和行軍，並且滋養豐富。西藏人體格的強健，未始不是糌耙的功效。牛羊的肉和乳則是較貴的食品。至於稻、麥、豆等類，因産量太少，在民衆生活上，沒有很大的補助。</p>
<p>但是，因了糌耙和牛羊肉乳，性燥而且滑膩，平時吃多了，沒有茶喝，就要生病，所以藏民論貴賤，茶是不可一日缺的飲料。飲茶方法，和內地大不相同，住院病人將茶煮好，加上黃油與鹽，用器攪勻，然後喝下。</p>
<p>吃飯時間沒有定時，食時不用箸，以手抓取，或用木碗，食畢以舌舐器使淨，再不必在水裏洗滌了，食肉一定用火煮熟，有所謂「生抓羊肉」的，似科還未脫除上古茹毛飲血的生食遺風。宴會時增設酒和　杏葡萄等果品，做敬客的陳食。</p>
<p>丙住的方面　　西藏的建築藝術是不壞的，祇看那些寺院和佛塔的莊嚴巍峨，就可想見了。然因西藏的民族，大都從事游牧，逐水草居，沒有固定的室家，他們就藉帳幕來代替了房屋。</p>
<p>在西藏的房舍，除了寺院和一宗教式的建造外，有碉樓，碉房，大廈三種。碉樓是用石砌成的，形似浮屠，上下有梯，堅牢得足以抗禦槍砲，碉房是用土堆成的，這是民間普遍的房舍，最低的亦有一樓一底的兩層，高的往往六七層不等，上幾層居人，最下層却畜養牲口的，惟是窗戶少有，光線感到太缺乏，僅在屋頂開小孔，透光和出烟都從那裏，室內多是異常的不潔，大廈要以拉薩境內最多，建築材料石或土都　有，大抵是喇嘛開會念佛的經堂。還有些在山間打柴爲生的番民，爲了打樵工作上的便利，依着山坡築室而居，也是很慣見的現象。</p>
<h3>東北各地　義軍又複活躍</h3>
<p>木蘭僞森林警察被繳械　安奉線日僞軍疲於奔命</p>
<p>哈爾濱通訊，據日軍透漏之情報稱，一月三十一日，在黑龍江省鳳山木蘭間之森林，有僞森林警察隊員六十名，受義軍趙部三百餘名之襲擊，將全隊武裝解除，該隊員等，生殖現尚未明，日僞軍已由木蘭出動，急行調查真像，近來義軍之活躍，其勢甚盛，茲另據僞方報告進擊義軍消息，略紀如下</p>
<p>依關東軍肅清治安工作，故東邊道地帶治安，可以轉佳，但未經實施積極進攻，安奉線地帶之義軍聲勢，漸次猖獗，此實由義軍採遊擊戰術，俟日僞大軍開到，義軍即引退他處，及日僞軍調開，義軍又捲土重來，此次安奉線之治安及交通上，大受威脅，日僞軍警已取緊密聯絡，共同維持附近一帶之治安，並於五月二十九夜，將關東局警察隊口百口口人（關東軍不發表克實軍數）用火車運往安奉線要地，又由本溪湖僞警察署長，編成聯絡警察隊及其他獨立各隊，第一期進擊工作，俟集合完畢時（歸即開始行動，對義軍天合黃承國等部，採包圍進擊陣勢，更以市瀨部隊廣島警備指導官所指導之本溪湖警察隊，遠由西北環繞，又以南部隊由東方前進，中島部隊向南方前進。淺川部隊向本文繞過，比及市瀨部隊廣島「滿」系部隊到達担家堡子附近，探悉天合部義軍百餘名，止宿於高家堡子，該部義軍於深夜積雪酷寒之中，向進擊之日僞軍頑強抵抗，交戰約有三小時，旋被　衝出重圍退支，是役，日軍死八人，僞軍死十餘人。</p>
<p>一月三十日午前及午後，日僞軍警，兩次前進，南部隊於三十日午後四時，在白石拉子西方廮地，遭遇義軍百五十餘名，戰中小時，義軍向西北退去，而神峙部隊餘夕刻，由南部隊之下面交　鬆權嶺線之義軍，加以攻擊，交戰至八小時之久，義軍決死頑抗，日軍損失甚重。</p>
<p>中島部隊，向險峻山岳地帶前進，淺川迂迴部隊，京繼續撤宵向前，並由援遼陽縣僞警察隊擔任大河沿警備之杉原部隊，期於三十日正午攻義軍根據地，卒遭義軍埋伏，被擊退去，由一月三十日一時，日東條司令官，帶同幕僚，篛偵警飛機，由空中視察義軍及日僞軍作戰狀況，且依通信筒指揮日僞軍作戰狀況，且依通信筒指揮日僞部隊之行動，仍遭失敗，死亡甚衆。所有受傷者，均收容安奉沿線之醫療機關，（東北社）</p>
<h3>首都國展會素描</h3>
<p>各省市監獄出品極稱精緻　西北實業公司各品尤美備</p>
<p>南京通訊，提倡國貨的呼聲，近年來高唱入雲，可是中外貿易入超，仍是有增無減，民國二十四年度，竟達三萬萬元以上，民族工業的衰落，一方面遭受著外來的經濟侵略，一方面又因了內在的技巧的幼稚，而陷於崩潰的境地，在手工業被近代的機器工業壓迫得幾乎全部解體，而社會經濟，跟著走上了末路的現階段，首都各界提倡國貨委員會，在江蘇民衆教育館舉行國貨樣品展覽會，這實在是具有著一處重大的意義的。</p>
<p>在入口處第一個概子裏，陳列著笪綱，乒乓球板等運動器具，乃是江蘇上海特區監獄的出品，這裏還懸掛著許多的毛織品，如駝色及雜色棉紗毯，爲山西榆次晉華晉生公司出品，栽絨椅墊，爲察哈爾第二監獄出品，獨幅提花棉紗毯，爲山西第二監獄出品，毛巾被，爲山東第三監獄及河北每一監獄出品，提花大线毯，爲山東少年監獄出品，非但質料堅固耐用，而其所採取的圖案色調等，也都非常美觀，另外又陳列著小孩榆木飯車，和籐皮三輪車，爲河北每一監獄出品，乃是經過一番設計而製成的新式用具，在市場上還昌很少見呢。</p>
<p>在另一個櫃子裏，所陳列的，乃是無錫出産的泥人，計有醒獅.愛神.孔子像.東方朔.無量壽佛.聖誕老人.勞來哈台.及三娘教子等，種類繁多，目不睱接，這是無錫著名的出産品，同時也是在兒童玩具方面佔有著相當的價值的，所可惜的，在構造和色彩上，還湧稱得是十分優美呢、</p>
<p>美靈登工藝廠，惠民墨水廠，三民臘紙廠，勤業文具公司等出品的水彩，色粉，墨汁，藍墨水，臘紙等一應文具，約十數種，在過去全須購買舶來，現在國貨中也都一一的出現了。</p>
<p>北平德盛號的鍍古銅各式墨盒，筆架，古銅架造像屏，皮盒龍鳳獅紐紅銅圓章等，蘇州陸益元的大小毛筆，這也是很出名的文具。</p>
<p>山西西北實業公司出品的鐵窗插銷，各種蔴花鑽，在政治上圓釘，繪圖儀器，十寸分厘尺，洋鎖，按鈴，絲扣規元度尺，鐵扣，熨鬥，轉數表等，分別陳列在一個櫃子裏，通常我們對於上列各種牲口，以爲是非用外國貨不行的，如今在國貨中也照樣可以得到了。</p>
<p>山西保晉鐵廠製造的各式磁器，也是一種非常優美的出品，江西景德鎮出産的磁器，不消說是舉國聞名的，據記者觀察，兩相比較，該廠的出品，毫不遜色，尤其是在西北方面居然能有這樣優異的五金材料和磁器出現，以供國人的採用，這真是國貨中的一支生力軍呢。</p>
<p>綢緞方面，蘇州振亞織物公司出品的燈芯毛葛，漁光絲，喬其絨，維也納，映雪絹，偉大呢，纙綿等，不下數十種，上海各廠家的出品，陳列並不是很多，但是我們看振亞廠出品的優美，也可以概見其餘了。</p>
<p>織綿靠墊，乃是南京惟一的特産品，這裏陳列著米色彩龍，紅色狠光，藍色彩飛鶴，美國康乃爾校等式樣多種，全是南京楊春記的出品。</p>
<p>青島冀魯針廠出品的在政治上縫紉鋼針，這也是國貨中的一種優異的收穫，過去完全是仰給於德國製造的，記者曾憶及當歐戰時，來源缺乏，售價陡增數倍，如今國貨中也産生了此種出品，可以不再感受外來的影響了。</p>
<p>在整個的展覽會中，張貼著異常警惕的標語。　救濟農村破産，惟有提倡國貨，　實行新生活，應該絕對服用國貨，　兒童年應該養成兒童絕對服用國貨的習慣。　不買洋貨送人，不接受洋貨贈品，　浪費金錢買洋貨，是最不首先的行爲，記者在會場中巡禮一週，感覺得國貨中有很好的出品，因了宣傳的欠缺，竟爲一般社會所忽略了，這親欲求國貨的推行盡利，一方須樹立服用國貨的信念，一方須使國貨出品爲一般人所深知，在這裏我願喚起國貨廠家的注意，這是記者個人葠觀國貨樣展的一些感想。（二.十四）</p>

<p>申報兒童專刊申報兒童志願徵文我將來做怎样的人  蘇州萃英中學附小六年生儲可欣　　　歷史告訴我們，中國原是文化發達很早的文明古國。可是到了現在，像政治咧，建設咧，實業咧，什麼都不如人家。民生日見困苦，國難更形嚴重，這都是科學不發達的緣故呀。因此，我想要救中國，只有去研究科學，纔是正當的途徑，唯一的方法。　　你看二十世紀的世界，完全是科學世界，那國科學發達，就是那國强盛。像我們中國，只知保守舊有的思想和習慣，不知注重科學的硏究，怎樣可以同科學發達的國家去抵抗呢？　　倘　科學發達了，就可以發明武器，打倒侵略我國的敵人。科學進步了，實業方才有發展的希望。總之社會上，無論那種事業，只有靠科學去解决和整　。因爲科學具有偉大的力量，所以我决心要做一個科學家，來救我們垂亡的祖國。　　但是做一個科學家，也不是容易的事。第一要能細心研究。瓦特不過因爲沸水能衝開壺蓋，他就去研究，結果能夠發明蒸汽機，這不是細心硏究的功效嗎？第二要能專心一志。牛頓當他專心研究時，把錶當做雞蛋投在洋鍋裏，後來果然能發明地心吸力，這不是專心一志的成績嗎？　　我能依了這兩點，就不難做一個科學家，爲國家發明精銳的武器，爲社會發展重要的實業。到了那時，我的心中是何等地愉快呀！希特勒幼年生活  珠明　　　稱爲世界怪傑的希特勒，名震全球。他的幼年生活怎樣呢？　　希特勒自興登堡總統死後，已一躍爲德國元首，可是他並不是德國人。他於一八八九年生於奧大利國邊界的小鎮上，曾請求入德國籍，竟被拒絕。後來居然做到國家社會黨的首領，爲全德意志千百萬人的領導者，本能要何等偉大，才能得到非常的擁護和發展。　　他步墨索里尼的後塵，要建立一個法西斯蒂的德意志，不消說是個政治家了。可是當他十一歲時，他的父親向他說，希望他將來做一個官，但他却願做個畫家或建築家，堅决的反對。他本來不願做官，如今竟做到元首，不是出人意外嗎？　　他十六歲時，投考藝學院，因肺病未取。再當木匠學徒，又因待遇苛刻脫離。畫家建築家都絕望，此後在小鎭上做過五年無名畫家，歐戰時在德國當過四年小兵，嗣投身政治舞臺，政變失敗，拘禁近一年牢獄。經過這些艱苦，忍耐奮鬥，才有今日地位。　　他在「余之奮鬥」文中說：「我在小鎭上五年的生活，有時難圖一飽，一面和饑餓奮鬥，一面勤勉的做事。做完了工以後的自由時間，差不多完全用在讀書上，所以讀了不少的書，並且是澈底讀了的，才築成我今日智識基礎」。　　德國國勢猛進，已聳動世界觀聽了，凡爾賽束縛條的，快爲希特勒打破。由此可見要改造自己，要改造國家，都非讀書不可。植物的種子  眞　　　在冬季中的星期日那天，敏兒走到家園裏遊玩，覺得一切自然界的生物都現出一種蕭條的氣象。他不知不覺的走到一株楓樹下，而樹上結滿了一串串的楓子。一陣風吹來，把那些楓子吹下來，那知楓子是旋轉的飄下來。他看見了便覺得很奇怪，就去呌他的哥哥聰兒：「哥哥，有一樣怪的東西在花園裏！去瞧！快快去瞧」！　　他倆很快的跑到花園裏去瞧。聰見見了，便對他說，「噢！原來是這麼一件事，害得我嚇了一跳」。　　「哥哥，楓子很奇怪，它爲什麼要生得這樣？別的種子是怎樣的」？　　「楓子這般的生法，是呌翅果，因爲它的果皮變成翅膀一般，它爲什麼要生得這樣？可以使它的種子飛得遠處去，並且是溶易被風吹散，還有其他的種子：　瘦果：果實裏只有一個種子，像向日葵的子。　　果：果實裏也只有一個種子，不過果皮和種皮是不分離的，像玉蜀黍的子。　堅果：果皮堅硬而成木質，橡栗子的種子」。　　「植物散布它的種子用什麽方法」？　　「植物散布種子的方法，因它的種子的構造不同，所以它傳種的方法，也就各各不同了。　黏附散種法：動物觸着了它，就黏附在動物的身體上，傳到各處，落在適宜的泥土中問，就發出新植勿來。　誘食散種法。它的果實的顏色美麗，滋味很甜，使動物吃了它果皮之後，把種子落在地上，仍舊可以蕃殖。　風力散種法：這種種子大概都是身體小而質量輕，能够飄在空中，不易落下，便可到遠處去蕃殖。　彈力散種法：是靠它的果皮有一種彈力，在種子成熟之後，如果外面有什麼接觸，果皮就分裂開來，果皮裏面立刻收縮，種子就彈到外面，傳播它的種子。　漂流散種法：在水裏的植物，它果實大多比水輕，所以浮在水面，並且果皮堅固，能够保護種子，不使水能侵害，所以順水漂流到遠地」。　　「植物散布它的種子，爲什麼各有不同」？　　「因爲植物的散布種子，是它一件最重要的事情。譬如一株楓樹，它的種十是很多，假使沒有它那種特殊的散種法，聚在它樹底下，起初雖然能够生長，到了後來便要枯死，因爲士壞裏面所含的養料，是有一定，如果生在一處，怎能供給它們的需要呢？並且陽光又不充足，它們就不能生長了。所以植物各有天然巧妙的方法，去散布它的種子」。時計可代指南針的妙用  清癯　　　小朋友們！你曉得時計這樣東西，有幾種用法？看了一天到晚，淅瀝，淅瀝，七時起身，十二時午餐，四時散課，那末：是大家知道這一隻時計的用處，沒有什麽希罕。　　我現在拿這隻時計來，當作指南針，講給你聽：時計的表面，不是分明劃淸十二小時麽？從一時起，不停的走到十二時，不是天天一樣的麽？因爲這一來，就可以拿時計改作指南針來妙用；你若不信的話，就可以走到曠野，或者有時候作郊外旅行，東西南北，不辨的當兒，從袋裏模出時計一看，就不會得不明白方向哩！什麽緣故？你當如在上午要向南前進，看清時計的短針，在十點鐘時候，正指著太陽。那末：十一點鐘處所桁的，就是正南的方向。要向北進行，就看十一點鐘的對經五點鐘處，就是正北的方向。你尙在下午，那末：短針在四點鐘處，正指著太陽，兩點鐘處所指的，就是正南的方向。要向北走去正，必定是兩點鐘的對經八點鐘處，就是正北的方向；這是極正確的一個道理，沒有絲亳會得錯誤的。　　有人對我說：如有一天，恰好沒有太陽在天空，而且身上沒有預備帶著時計，那末：仍舊要受到迷途的苦處，還向那裏去問個淸楚呢？我說：你不要打急，荒凉寂寞的地方，路人或者不易碰到，荒村草野之中，樹木必定是很多的。你要辨別方向，看樹木的表皮，如其顏色是黝黑的，這一面是向北的，靑而帶些有苔痕的樣子，這一面就是向南，也從來沒有會得錯誤的啊！全國兒童讀物展覽會紀詳  瘦秋　　　籌備了多時的全國兒童讀物展覽會，已經在前天正式開幕了！地點是借的南京中山路大行宮小學。陳列的各種兒童讀物，計　千八百七十種，册數達一萬二千餘册，搜羅的　富，也就可以想見。　　這决展覽品的分類，的分爲三大部份：第一是補充讀物類，其中文藝組有五百七十二種，社會組二百八十七種，自然組一百二十一種，叢刊五百○九種，期刊八十一種，共計是一千五百七十種。第二是參考書類，其中外國兒童讀物組有二百四十一種，社會流行的兒童讀物有二百二十九種；兒童硏究的讀物有二百種。共計是六百七十種。第三敎科書類，其中公民組有八十種，　生組有三十三種，常　組有二十五種，美術組有四十二種，勞作組有十五種，昔樂組有二十六種，國語組有一百十七種？自然組有七十六種，算術組有一百○八種，社會組有一百○八種：共是六百三十種。　　首都各小學生參觀的辦法，是由社會局規定的，某一天讓某幾個小學去參觀。此外，各界也隨時可以進去參觀。國民政府的林主席，前天也去過一次，很是　美。場內的招待員，都是京中各小學的優秀女生，年齡最大的祇十三歲，小的才有十歲，一律穿着藍色的衣服，待人接物，很和　有　，這一點，給予參觀的人們以很好的印象。　　第七展覽室裹有一個批評處，桌上放者筆墨和一本簿子。參觀的人們，可以在上面寫上自己的意見，不過那上面大部份是頌揚的字句，貢獻意見的是很少。該會對於展覽物將加以批判，評判的　　，　於內容方面的，約分八項：計　適合國情；　不背黨義；　適合兒童程度，　事理　確，　思想正當，含義積極，　文字通暢　美；　合於國格，絕少方言；　立論穩當。屬於形式方面的計分七項，　挿圖正確明顯；　挿圖生動　美，　字體大小適當；　排列適當；　紙張適用；　裝訂堅固美觀；　售價　　。老貓  　　　一個老太婆有一隻貓，這隻貓的年紀是很大了；伊不能跑得很快，伊也沒有吃老鼠的能力了，爲什麽呢？因爲伊年紀老啦！　　有一天，這老貓看見一隻老鼠，伊用盡平生的力量，跳過去把它捉住了。但是可憐呵！伊的老牙齒咬不下那老鼠，老鼠趁此就從伊的嘴邊掙扎着逃掉了。　　老太婆見了非常憤怒，天下有貓不能吃掉老鼠的事嗎？伊就開始打那老貓了。老貓可憐地說：「好女主人呵！不耍打你的老僕人吧！我已替你做了多年的工作了。我還要想替你工作下去，但是我的好女主人呵！實在，我是太老啦！唉！請你不要虐待老年者呀！記着：因爲老年者在他們年輕的時候，會　忠地替他們的主人做過事情的」　　聽了那話，老太婆覺得很是慚愧。睡覺不要蒙頭  寗自强　　　小朋友！現在氣候仍很寒冷，寒暑表裹的水銀降落到冰點以下！在這時候，不消說是風雪交加，重衾不暖。可是冷天睡覺，有許多小朋友，每因重衾不暖的緣故，更將被頭把頭蒙住。這種蒙頭的習慣，是一種不好的習慣，讓我來告訴你罷！　　我們人類呼吸需要養氣，是諸位曉得的。所以有人主張在冷天，只要不直吹床上的窗子，仍須開放，因為能放進養氣的緣故。你如果把被頭滿滿的蒙住頭，不要說沒有養氣，恐怕呼出來的炭氣，沒有排出去的餘地，豈不是有窒息的危險。但是小朋友心裏想，睡覺蒙頭，不一定卽會窒息。但我要告訴諸位，窒息雖不常見，爲衛生起見，總以不蒙頭爲妙。新童話  村言　　一羣綿羊，正在翼東　「察北僵」的　着新年　　。因為　得不大好，所以　請大野心家，虎公公來，做最高指導。像這樣虎羊合作之下，結果如何呢？兒童園地街上  斯盛學校六年級福基　　　　　上星期六，我站在十字路上，只見車馬來來往往，黃包車夫，爲了求生存，在街上跑來跑去，又見那商店裏，大减價，大拍賈的旗號，在半空中飄揚着，店裏的樓上還有音樂隊，吹着敲着，準備拉生意，但是到店裏去買東西的人還是很稀少，這眞是市面的衰落，　　在左面的轉角上，有一大堆人園在那裏，人聲嘈雜，我也跑過去看了，一看原來是一個小販；在那裏哭着，我聽見人家說：「他是賣香蕉的，警士說他把香蕉皮亂抛在地上，但是這皮不是他抛的，警士打他，他才哭的，」可憐啊！一個謀生的小販，平白地被警士打着駡着，眞是可憐啊！義狗傳（七）  心靑　　　小南洛和伯德希共同工作很順利，很快樂。老達士到夏天雖已恢復了健康，也不必再出夫勞動，儘可座在門口陽光中，眼瞧着他們從　子的小門中一同出去。他就在那裹打睡覺，做好夢，更略略的祈禱着，到得　　三下，他就醒回來，守候他們回家。他們回到了家裹，柏德希擺脫了車兒，很高興的叫了一聲，小南洛也得驕傲地訴說這一天的工作。他們倆隨即一同　去，吃那裸麥的　包，牛乳和湯，瞧那平原上的人影漸漸地長起來，更瞧那夕　罩住了　拜堂的失頂；於是一同淸下來，安然入睡，而老達士便在旁邊給他們喃喃祈禱。光陰一天天年年的過去，小南洛和柏德希的生活是非常快樂，身體也分外的康健。　　　在春夏兩季，尤其是他們快樂的時期，可是法蘭特斯並不是一個可愛的地方，而在羅本城一帶更覺得沒有意味。五殺和菜蔬，草原和　　，那散滿在一片平原上，全是一模一樣。除了歲座灰　色的瘦塔，歲下淒涼的鐘聲，或是田中來了一個農人背了一束乾草，一個樵夫挑著一但木材，略有　意外，此外便毫無變化，毫無美麗的風景。所以不論是誰，凡是住在山上或森林中的，都像受了監禁似的，十分沈悶，而覺得這　漠荒凉的平原，是沒有邊際的。然而這地方是一片碧綠而極其肥沃的。那　闊的地平綫雖覺單調，郤也自有它的一種美點；水邊的產業裹，一朶朶朵的野花，高高的樹，很是鮮潤。河中常有游艇，很快的溜過，黑色的船身反映着陽光，綠色的小烟　和雜色的旗子襯托着綠的樹葉，異常美觀。不倒翁  路爾鈺　　　不倒翁！不倒翁！弟弟打你你不痛，翁不倒！翁不倒！我來笑你你不笑！一上一下，一下一上，好比爸爸吃醉了！你有精神你眞好，一天到晚學體操，不像無錫的泥娃娃，一記拳頭也吃不消！化學遊戲生雞蛋裝入小口瓶的魔術  黃軒宗　　雞蛋大，瓶口小，要不打碎蛋殼，常然是不能裝入瓶裏的，這裏的方法，可以不必將蛋打碎，很容易整個的把它裝進瓶裏。　　材料　生蛋一個。口子比蛋略小的玻璃瓶。酸醋。先將生蛋浸在很濃厚的酸醋裹，經過幾小時以後，蛋殼便會變軟，放進玻璃瓶，自然就很容易

<p>電信竺栞交通部指導下之電信事業  楨　　　天津大公報一月十日論「中央政務宜全局整頓」一文，有言曰：「中國政治機能，極不完全，政策行動，多形矛盾，各機關大抵祇知本身之利害，而不求全體之事功，祇有局部的眼光，而不爲綜合的打算。如交通機關，但知提高運費，而不知農工生產出路壅塞，其結果適足以妨碍交通方面之收入。」語重心長，切中時弊。現今中央政權之統一與鞏固，較民國以來任何時期爲强，對於過去一切矛盾現象，必然加以調整，輿論足以指導政治，該報所論，實國民心理所欲言者也。　　電政爲中央行政之一，除電信條例另有規定者外，應歸中央機關主辦，自無疑義，惟各省政府有長途電話之敷設，非軍用機關有短波電臺之通信，不特違反中央法令，抑且有背經濟原理，關於此點，本刋歷來主張應由中央統制辦理。上期浩君「統籌電政問題」一文，業已剴切陳明，實爲本刋之代表作。今幸行政院政務處長蔣廷黻先生已注意及此，想有以饜吾人之望也。　　至該文所稱交通機關，但知提高運費，而其結果，適足以妨碍交通方面之收入一節，誠爲不刋之論，惟所指交通機關，似爲運輸機關，而非通信機關，電政自不包括在內。吾人在電言電，竊覺兩年來交通部主辦之電信事業，靡不以民衆爲對象，雖在電政經濟極端困難之時，猶創行减低報費便利民衆種種方法。僅就收報人名住址作三字計費一項而言，每年損失四十餘萬元，兩年以來，殆已八十餘萬元，在目光短淺者，對於此種政策，雖表同情，然不敢舉辦，恐收入短少，善後無策，而　　當局，毅然决然規定自二十三年一月一日起實行，此非交通當局昧於收支適合原理，故作此驚人之舉，實國營事業，應以减輕民衆負担與便利民衆通訊爲原則，然後有發達之可言也。　　査各種電報電話省費辦法，自二十三年一月起陸續施行以來，已逾兩年，此兩年中之電信業務長進乎？抑退化乎？亟待數字以證明之。如或長進，則省費辦法之成功，吾則失敗。其成功也，則可悟國營事業應持之方針，其失敗也，則可見國民經濟能力之衰落，二者之間，大有研究之餘地。茲將民國十七年至二十三年之國內電報去報字數决數之概數，圖列如左；　　民國十七年至二十三年國內電報去報之字數决數比較圖　　准上圖觀之則知二十三年國內去報字數，雖較二十一年爲少，而决數則較多，且皆有向上趨　，由此可見二十三年利用電報之民衆，較前有興趣，而電報業務，亦較前爲發達。是交通部現今所行之電政方針，似得相當之成功。希望中央對於全國電政，加以調整，統一指揮，以最少之經濟，收最大之效率。中央政務前途，庶乎有豸從中日電信合作說到中日合作  松　　　中日兩國，同文同種，同洲同洋，玄化上有共同之特點，地理上有密切之關係，彼此應當嚴密合作，自屬天經地義。願近年來以兩國交際之頻繁，因而發生之交涉甚夥，此　情形，實爲國際間常有之事實。苟能以平等互助之精神，與公正和平之態度，推　相興，諒解爲懷，决無不能合作之理也。　　大者勿論，卽以電信事業言之，亦可喩其大概。査中日商務素繁，往來電報，佔我國國際電報之一半。以前經由水錢傳遞，阻斷堪虞，不能發生最高效率，自前年六月開放中日無綫電報電路後，中日電報，驟形發達，根據二十四年統計，中日無綫電路傳遞中日電報來去報字數，駕外商水錢傳遞者而上之。足見彼此合作，雙方利益在焉，吾則俱威不便也。　　中日電政當局，爲發展兩國電信事業起見，已於昨日（十五日）開放中日無綫電話業務。共業務情形，已有文另誌，茲不贅。聞此項通話，發音淸晰，恍如對晤，從此中日人士，除利用電報以通達情他外，並可利用電話，晤言一室。不僅中日兩國之電信事業，得以發展，且中日兩國之國際關係，得以愈加密切矣。　　夫國與國交，以信義爲原則，而信義之基礎，在乎「誠」字之實行，所謂「不賊不信」「誠者成也」是也。中日電政當局，彼此相見以「誠」先將「不誠」心理掃除，故中日通話，得以成立。換言之：中日通話，卽「誠」的作用使然也。且國際通話之機件與時間，均須極正確極靈敏，始能對答如流，正確與靈敏，卽「義」字之精義，苟不能達到「義」字目的，又何能期於必「信」耶？　　中日無綫電話之開放，在於以「誠」的心理，「義」的態度，然後有「信」的表現。本此精神，以磋商一切問題，則共存共榮之說，自可見諸事實也，中日兩國人士，可不勉乎哉？中日無線電話正式通話  麟　　　中日無綫電話，經我國交通部及日本遞信省積極籌備，爲期數月，自本月十五日起，上海東京間業已正式開放通話，聲浪非常淸晰，宛如一室晤談，而呌接及通話手續，允爲迅速，當日通話者，無不引爲滿意。　　按無綫電話爲晚近發明之通信利器，與無綫電報及有錢電報電話同爲現代電信交通之主脈，各有其異曲同工之效用，有綫電原利於短距離之通信，但如遠隔重洋或其他長距離之通信，則以利用無錢電較爲便捷，而兩地商務發達者，允以無綫電話爲最相宜。蓋長途電報所優於電報之處，以取費旣較低廉，而通話之兩方，因對談之故。得以磋商研究，立候答覆，不必再須回電，經濟時間，兩可節省，故近年歐美各國，彼此間多已接通無綫電話，而允以美國利用爲最甚，且因幅圓遼闊，國內各地通信，近來亦有兼用無綫電話者。　　中日兩國，國境昆連，關係綦密，我國對外貿易，無論在進口方面抑在出口方面，素以日本居首位，由於商業上之需要，消息之傳遞，自應力求便利，過去中日電信交通，除經滬崎靑佐水綫外，上海國際電台亦可與日本通報，依據二十四年之統計，發往日本去報共有二五四。四六九决，足見報務之繁忙，而水錢，時有障礙發生，上海電台，亦時感錢路擁擠，是單憑原有設備，仍不足以收充分便利之效，實有增進電信交通便利之必要。蓋電信交通之便利，一方面有助於兩國商務之發展，以達到經濟上之互惠，同時另一方面，亦可藉電信之聯絡，掃除兩國國民間之隔閡，以促進政治上之調整，中日兩國交通當局有鑒於此，故均以莫大之趣味，努力以求電信交通聯繁之密切，此决中日無綫電話之通話，卽由於此種努力而籌備成功者也。　　據國際電信局發表，上海東京間國際無綫電話之通話種類，話費及通話手續規定如次：　　（一）通話種類（甲）呌人通話（須先說明本人姓名及電話號數，並指定須呌某號電話及某人聽話者，）（乙）呌號通話（係指通話時不指定受話或發話人之姓名而僅指定某號電話者，）（丙）傳呼通話（與某處某人通話，而對方並未裝有電話機，須經話局派人前往通知者。）　　（二）話費最初三分鐘規定法幣十五元，通話不滿三分鐘，亦作三分鐘計費，以後每逾一分鐘或不滿一分鐘者，遞加法幣五元。（上述三種通話，均屬同價）　　（三）手續欲由本市華界內通話者先接四○號，由公共租界內通話者，先接○三號，然後聲請掛號，隨卽聲明擬通話種類，國際電話接通後，卽由話局通知講話。　　（四）銷號費國際電話已經接通後，對方不願聽話，或受話人找尋無着者作爲銷號論，每决須納銷號費法幣一元五角。　　據聞此項業務目前暫以上海與東京間開放爲限，將來再逐漸推行於各處，中日國交及貿易前途，今後必有相當之進步，蓋可預卜也。試述國際電話營業通則之要點  靑　　　交通部上海國際電台籌備中日。中英。中菲等國際通話，歷時已久，現在中日通話業經籌備完竣，於昨日起開始營業。交部爲適應需要起見，特頒訂國際電話營業通則一種，於本年二月十五日起施行。査國際電話在我國尙屬初創，一切通話規則諒爲社會人士所急欲知曉者，茲特將上項營業通則內重要各點，撮述於决，以供衆覽：　　　通話之種類及優先權國際通話分爲政務。業務。私務三種：凡國家之首，中央各院部會署主管長官，陸軍海軍或空軍總司令，以及締的國之常駐外交官或領事所耍求之通話，均作爲政務通話；凡國際電話主管機關間，完全爲關於國際電話業務上之通話，稱爲業務通話：凡不屬於政務或業務之通話，概稱爲私務通話。政務通話對於共他各種通話得於優先權：急要之業務通話，對於私務通話有優先權：各種國際通話對於國內加急長途電話有優先權。至國際通話之性質，又可分爲「呌號」。「呌人」。「傳呼」。三類：「呌號通話」，祇須說明發話人與受話人之電話號碼：「呌人通話」，須指明電話號碼，發話人與受話人姓名，及其他特指事項；至「傳呼電話」適用於未裝電話之受話人。又國際電話，經發話人在規定營業時間以內，預定通話時刻，並經先行掛號者，稱爲定時通話，此種通話如爲業務與電路狀况所容許，得在相近預定通話時刻，設法接通。　　　掛號之手續凡欲「呌號通話」者，應先呼呌其電話交換所，經交換所之請求，須吿知下列各欵：（一）受話地名；（二）受話之電話號碼，如電話號碼不明，吿以受話人之姓名住址；（三）發話人電話號碼；（四）預定通話時刻，及其他特指事項。凡欲「呌人通話」或「傳呼通話」者，其掛號手績，除按照上述「呌號通話」之四項規定外，並須吿知：一。關於足以確定發話人與受話人之各項通知，（如兩方之姓名，所在服務機關或團體之名稱，所在機關內某一部份之名稱，分機之電話號碼，以及通話用何種語言等）；二。如爲政務通話，發話人必須說明其所要求者爲政務通話，並報吿其官銜。至發話入未裝電話者，可往電話交換所塡單通話。　　　通話之預備發話局接到受話局下列各項報吿之任何一項後，卽行轉知發話人，準備接話或銷號：（一）受話者一可呌到；（二）受話人因不願談話，呌不到，或其他原因，不能接受通話；（三）一關於傳呼通話，受話局已設法通知受話人來局接話。發話人準備通話或正在通話時，如因話機或綫路發生隊礙，或其他相類原因，不能通話時，得由另一話機完畢共通話。　　　收費之規定國際通話價目，由交通部規定，所有發話人應付之通話費，應以中國國幣繳付。至其價目不論政務私務，不論「呌人」「呌號」或「傳呼」均屬相同。每决通話費，至少以三分鐘計算。三分鐘以上，每加計費時間一分鐘，加收每次三分鐘通話費之三分之一。其最後通話不滿一分鐘之時間，亦照一分鐘計算。「呌號通話」之計費時間，以雙方話機均已接通，雙方用戶可以開始談話時算起。「呌人通話」之計費時問，以雙方話機均已接通，所指定之通話人可以開始談話時算起。其未裝電話之發話人，請求通話時，應先行繳足最初三分鐘之通話費，迨通話完畢後，再行計算話費總數，如有差額，應卽補繳。至計費通話時間，可以廷長至十二分鐘，如無他人等候通話，則可延長至十二分鐘以上。但話務繁忙時，話局得限制通話時間至十二分鐘以下。又發話人得預先請求話務員於雙方談話時，予以間斷，並將經過之計費時間通知本人。　　　銷號之限制發話人在未開始　話以前，得隨時請求銷號。但請求銷號時，如在收到上述第　項所規定任何報吿之一種之後者，應繳納銷號費。至在接通電路手續完畢後，如有下列各項情形之一者，本决通話亦作爲銷號，並照一收銷號費：（一）受話方面無回音或無法通知收話人；（二）受話人呌不到或不願接話；（三）受話人呌到而發話方面無回音；（四）受話人呌到而發話人呌不到，或不願接話。但上述四項情形，如係因話機或綫路發生障礙所致者，不收銷號費。又除定時通話外，發話人於掛號之時起二小時內，未接任何報吿；或話務員於（甲）接到發話及受話兩方面可以通話之報吿後，或（乙）於指定之通話時刻起，一小時內不能接通通話因而銷號者，均不收銷號費。但如報吿在二小時以內達到，而因發話人不答復，或因答復遲緩，（如因機綫障礙所致者除外）致話務員不克轉知發話人時，發話人不能以未接報吿爲理由，而不付銷號費。一年來之電信工程  記者　　　二十四年份內交通部主辦之電信工程，有顯著之成績，兹將其犖犖大者，概述如下；　　（甲）有綫電報　　一，綫路之修建　　有綫電報以錢路爲其主要設備，我國電報綫路，綿亘十餘萬公里，大都年久失修，加之比年以來，軍事迭興，更多破壞，是以修整錢路，遂爲我國電信行政上一重要工作。二十四年份內，對於原有綫路破壞或通報不暢者，加以修理，計已完成者七〇五一公里，未完成者二七〇九公里。對於新設局所或爲謀兩局之得直接通報者，敷設新錢，計四〇八三公里，未完成者一七九公里。至因業務增繁原有錢條不敷分配者，則加掛綫條，計二九三五公里，未完成者，四九〇公里。　　二，機件之裝置　　Ａ，裝克利特自動機者：　南京漢口錢，　上海北平綫，　北平天津錢，　北平漢口綫，　天津烟台綫，　烟台大連綫。　　Ｂ，裝韋氏機者：　巴縣成都綫，　巴縣貴陽綫，　成都雅安錢，　長沙貴陽錢，　長沙洪江綫，　洪江貴陽錢，　長沙常德錢，　漢口廣州綫，　上海鄞縣綫，　成都峨嵋綫，

<p>申報本埠增刊　業餘周刊經濟往來美農整法判違憲及其影響  雲峯　　　　美國的農業調整法（AAA）與產業復興法（BRA）是羅瓶福的所謂新政的兩大支柱。但NRA在去年五月已被美國最高法院判爲違憲，最近AAA又遭到了同樣的命運，這對於羅斯福的復與政策不消說是一個嚴重的打擊，因而對於美國乃至世界經濟都是有很大的影饗的。　　在恐慌期中，不僅工業品表現出生產過剩的現象，卽農產品也有同樣的不良傾向。美國羅斯福的農業調整法便是用來限制農產品的生產，以緩和農業恐慌的。依據這個法案，則是由政府設立農業諷整事務局，限制各項農產品之播種面積，限制生產；對於實行减少生產的農民並給與津貼；同時，農民領受津貼後須繳農產品改造稅，以補償政府一部的支出。這樣的農業調整法是在去年五月十二日公佈的。公佈之後，各農民曾與農業調整事務局訂立契約，接受限制生產法，但對於改造稅却表示反對，並向法院提起控訴，說政府的這種表現是違反憲法的。當時政府曾將這法案修正，在參衆兩院通過。最近由於胡薩克棉織廠拒絕繳納基於農整法的改造稅和營業稅（其數共有八萬一千六百九十多美圓），與政府發生紛爭，控訴到最高法院。本年一月六日，最高法院竟判决農整法是違反憲法的。這個判决的根據，主要的有兩點；。决定營業稅是議會的越權；一，依據農整法的農産物生產統制，是侵害州的權限的　如果實際分析起來，那羅斯福的農業調整法所引起的糾紛，乃是美國資本主義的地主和企業家的利害衝突的反映。不過，我們不想基於這點來詳細分析農整法失敗的問題；現在，應該接着說的，是農整法被判違憲後所發生的影響。　　首先，因爲農整法被判違憲，依此法成立的農業調整局卽須馬上解散，農業品的改造稅和營業稅當然也要馬上停止徵收；在另一方面，政府給與農民的津貼似乎也應停止支付了。這樣，對於政府的財政好像沒有多大的影饗似的。但實際情形却不是如此。因爲羅斯福政府在最高法院未判决前與農民訂立的限制生產契約，無論如何也要履行，從而政府給與農民的津貼仍須繼續支付。據估計，政府大約還要支出三億美元的農民津貼。這樣，一方面政府的財政收入旣减少了農產品的營業稅部分，另一方面又耍繼續支出津貼，結果當然會給政府的財政以莫大影響的。在農整法失效後，華盛頓即傳來了這樣一個消息：「羅斯福總統一九三七年之預算案，在提交國會之前，卽已不能收支相抵；因農產法失效之後，總統原來估計之營業稅美金五四七·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元，卽已失去根據；卽一九三六年列入預算之五二九·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元，亦僅收得六四·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元。」因此，最近美國財玫當局又核准補充預算案三六七·七〇〇·〇〇〇元，其中有二九六·一八五·〇〇〇元，就是用以給全國農民之津貼的。但這補充預算案雖是塡補了因農整法失效所發生的預算不足，然而根本的財政困難問題却並未解决。　　其次是農整法的失效對於農村的影響。依據農整法，有十五種農產物被限制生產。拿棉花來說吧，在農整法的規定下，一九三五年要减少種地百分之二十五乃至三十五，一九三六年（從本年八月到明年七月）更當减少百分之三十乃至四十五。現在農整法旣然失效，棉花的生產也就無所謂限制，因而其價格必會低落。事實上，在農整法被判違憲後，不僅美國，卽世界的棉花市塲也發生了很大的變動。　　美國的農村收入，政府的津貼佔很重要地位。這是在下面的統計數字中可以見到的——　　農家現金收入　其中所有的津貼一九三二年　四，三七七——一九三三年　五，四〇九　二七八一九三四年　六，二六七　五九四一九三五年（豫想）六，七〇〇　五四〇（單位百萬美金）　　但在農整法被判違憲後，雖然政府因爲契的關係不能停止農民的津貼支付，但這在今後農村收入方面仍有重大的影響，因而農村的購買力亦有隨之更加縮减的危險。美國農長華來斯曾以無線電廣播演說，表示農業調整法失效之後，恐於數年以內美國將再發生農村危機：他更具體的指出：「營業稅取消之後，一二年中，結果或能頗爲良好，惟過此時期，則全國農村之收入將大爲减低。」　　現在，美政府已提出代替農整法的新農業法，據說於最近可望在眾院通過。但在美國的企業家與地主的尖銳國爭中？美國農村的危機是否能爲人力所緩和，還是很大的問題。　　同時，農整法的失效還使美國的通貨膨脹派促使羅斯福再行減低美金貶值，這對於世界的匯兌也是有重大關係的　　最後，我們要特別指出：由於農整法之繼產業復興法而被判違憲，已表明了美國藍鷹運動之失敗，已表明了目前的經濟危機不是人力所能挽回的。風俗誌三種不同的過年習俗  旅人　　　（一）俄人過年——俄國人過年，有一種叫做「忘年會」的組織，不過這大都祗限於旅居在中國，特別是哈爾濱的白俄。到了十二月三十日的晚上，他們便把「忘年會」與慶祝元旦合共舉行一種集會，名曰「送迎會」，意即送舊年迎新年。在這天，凡屬白俄，不管男女老幼都可自由參加；除年輕的俄人外，一般年老的男女也都穿着鮮艷奪目的晚裝，興緻勃勃地到會。自然，不吉利的言語行動在道裏也是懸爲例禁的。會中預先設有一個舞臺，到將近十二時，便徐徐啟慕；臺上滿綴着五光十色的電燈，輝煌耀目，更配以悠揚的爵士音樂，使一般置身其中的會衆，簡直似酒醉般的瘋在。當自鳴鐘正敲十二下時，舞臺上的表演更加緊張，愈顯出是一個新年來臨的景象。道時，臺下的會衆，每人身傍的銀亮茶几上，都滿擺着香檳酒，開瓶聲一時便像走火的機關槍般的劈劈拍拍的饗着；全場會衆都舉起滿注着酒的琥珀杯，五相慶賀新年的到來，在歡的呼喊使一個局外人聽了簡直要頭腦漲裂。過此，便祗聽見臺下的喝酒聲，和臺上的歌聲互相輝映；一般靑年男女，間有老年的夫婦，都趁着酒興，互相戲謔，擁抱，在吻，種種情態毫不隱諱地表現出來這樣，直到上午二時至三時，各人始精疲力盡，意與闌珊地挾着愛人或妻子，口裹喃喃地唱着人所聽不懂的歌曲，踉蹌地踏上歸程。　　元旦日這天，也如國人一樣有拜年一事。拜年時多喜用「祝賀新年」，「視君健康」和「多幸」，這一類含有祝意的諛辭。婦女走在路上，如遇有親友，也多說上述的祝辭；不過臨別時，却不管所遇的人爲男爲女及人數的多少，都得一個一個地接吻一决，然後揮手而別。　　（二）朝鮮人過年——鮮人於三十一日夜間，俗有還「鬼債之舉。據說這天「鬼債」極多，所以在這天夜半，家家都焚香化紙，以免「鬼」上門索債，並可保一家人平安無虞。「鬼債」還後，一家人便齊集按决站在庭院中，大放爆仗，舉行祭神的儀式；先由家長取供菓一片銜入口內，移時，即吐出，依次轉遞與第二人，第三人，直到最幼的小孩都　到，然後才把先前紮好的草把人一幷燒化，道叫做「脫除麻煩」。　　元旦日拜年，見面語多喜用「本年中多蒙指導援助了」；女子在元旦這天就絕對不許外出，俗稱「女早爲魔鬼，遇之不祥」，男子都不願意在這天遇見女人，所以女子就祗好藏在家裏度着元旦。　　在元旦的早晨，不論是已分家或沒有分家的人家，都得全家齊集到「老宅」——即祖屋——內，以家長做中心來領導全家的人上祭。祭時，先把雜糧飯和三牲一樣樣的從廚下傳出，一由最幼者一人起，一直傳到家長手裏，才供奉到列祖列宗的神牌前，然後再領　子女行禮。男女立的地位是在昭右穆，形式　為嚴肅。祖堂屋內的中央，放着像廟裏用的一張香案，上面滿擺着祭品和「五供」；男女行過禮後就在祖堂屋裏舉行種種遊戲，如「蹴彩球」，「搖蕩板」等等，男女互相嬸戲，家長看見了也不加以干涉。　　十五這天，即元宵節，算是新年可以娛樂的最後一天了；這天家家都要預備一種用大米</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Current Situation of the Anti-Imperialist Movement of Weak and Small Nationalities</h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Italian-Ethiopian War, international relations have been ever-changing. For example, the alliance between Britain and France, Germany's remote action to restore colonies, Japan's call for Britain to open up the Eastern market, the rumor that Hirota advocated that the United States and Japan divide the Pacific equally, and the recent proposal by former British Labour Party leader Lansbury in the House of Commons to redistribute world resources are all new situations in international relations. This subtle and complex international situation can be summarized in one sentence: the contradiction between the monopolistic power of colonies and semi-colonies and the movement for re-division.</p>
<p>The influence of this intensified contradiction is, on the one hand, the strengthening of the control of the suzerain state over its colonies, and on the other hand, the rapid advancement of the independence movement of weak and small nationalities due to their inability to withstand the economic and extra-economic exploitation of their suzerain states. As the Italian-Ethiopian War expanded and Britain consolidated its warning line against African colonies, the anti-British sentiment of the Egyptian nation rose sharply, and the liberation movement of weak and small nationalities spread like bamboo shoots after a rain.</p>
<p>According to the latest telegram from the National News Agency, a fierce anti-French storm broke out in Syria, a French mandated territory, today. The Speaker of the Syrian Parliament sent a telegram to the League of Nations and the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs protesting the authorities' use of high-pressure means, which led to bloodshed. At the same time, 50 members of the Iraqi Parliament also jointly sent a protest letter to the League of Nations mandated official, saying, "France should bear the blame for all the disputes in Syria." In addition, Palestine and Transjordan, which are adjacent to Syria and Iraq, are also thinking of organizing a Pan-Arab state due to the influence of the national independence movement. It is said that Britain is very worried about this.</p>
<p>In South America, there are strikes in Chile, and the same unstable phenomena in Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador. We are in the same position as the weak and small nations of the world, and we express our infinite sympathy to them. The surge of national movements can also give the Chinese people a correct understanding and the courage to work hard. The so-called correct understanding is that the national movement at the present stage has entered the eve of universal joint action and has a transnational nature. All the disputes in the weak and small nations are caused by the imperialist countries that control the rights and interests. In the relationship between the imperialist countries and the weak and small nations, the so-called "reciprocity," "assistance," and "cooperation" are nothing but hypocritical shams. Knowing this, we can know how to get rid of the shackles of imperialism, which is the basic condition for our nation's survival. Without this, we cannot talk about the progress of national fortune and the revival of the nation, and without this, the country cannot be stable.</p>
<h3>Arita Suggests Unifying Policies Towards China to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan. All Negotiations Should Be Based on Mutual Trust. Saying Nanjing Meeting Will Wait for Our Notification.</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Arita Akira, the ambassador to China, met with the new ambassador Arita Hachiro, Vice Minister Shigemitsu, Director of East Asia Bureau Kuwajima, and Director of Information Bureau Amakasu at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the afternoon of the 12th. After criticizing the Japanese government's policies towards China, Arita expressed his views to provide a reference for the government to establish new policies:</p>
<p>"There are various criticisms in Japan about Chiang Kai-shek's attitude towards Japan. However, according to my observation, Chiang is seriously working hard to adjust Sino-Japanese relations. Japan's policies towards China have always lacked unity, and there are also different opinions in the country. Such policies and opinions must be fundamentally reformed. When the Chinese government is seriously preparing to start negotiations on adjusting Sino-Japanese relations, it is absolutely necessary for Japan to unify its national opinion on China and respond to all future negotiations with a consistent diplomatic policy."</p>
<p>Based on his experience in China over the past three and a half years, Arita advocated the unification of diplomatic policies. As a result of the exchange of views on the North China, Manchuria, and Mongolia issues by all personnel, the following policies were decided:</p>
<p>There is no other way to adjust Sino-Japanese relations except based on the spirit of mutual trust and friendship between the two countries. Japan should implement diplomacy towards China with a unified national policy.</p>
<p>It is very necessary for China and Japan to cooperate and be friendly with each other to establish the so-called three principles. The three principles of Foreign Minister Hirota in this parliament speech are the diplomatic method for the whole world.</p>
<p>The Chinese government proposed to convene the Nanjing Conference on December 27 last year to discuss the adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations. Japan is prepared and will submit concrete matters of the three principles as soon as the Chinese side passes the conference preparations. However, no notification has been received from the Chinese government. The government instructed Arita Ambassador to negotiate with Chiang Kai-shek as soon as he arrives to resolve outstanding cases one by one. (Fifteenth Allied Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Xu Shiying Said He Will Work Hard to Promote Sino-Japanese Friendship</h3>
<p>Nanjing: Xu Shiying attended a banquet hosted by Foreign Minister Zhang and two Foreign Vice Ministers Xu and Chen at noon on the fifteenth, and went to Shanghai at 5:00 PM on the afternoon of the sixteenth. Xu will come to Beijing again on the nineteenth to visit Chairman Lin and President Chiang for instructions before going abroad. A reporter visited Xu, and Xu said that Japan's political rectification in recent years, and the nation's advocacy of thrift, hard work, and endurance, as well as contributions in culture and science, are also admired by us. I have never been to Japan before. This time I am willing to have a deeper understanding and work hard for the future of Sino-Japanese friendship. Sino-Japanese relations in the past have inevitably become complicated due to various relations. In the future, I think we should strive for the four words of faith and fairness to make the friendship between the two countries grow day by day. I hope that the Japanese government and the public will hold the same idea and work together for the future of Sino-Japanese friendship. Then it is not only the blessing of the Far East, but also the happiness of the world. I have always admired loyalty, trustworthiness, sincerity, and respect. I think that China and Japan are brotherly countries, and their fortunes are shared. The complexity of past relationships should be based on sincerity and trust, and I hope to seek solutions from simplicity. If we can proceed accordingly, it is expected that friendship can be increased. I am 64 years old, and in my old age, I am already unable to take on important responsibilities again. For more than ten years, I have been running around and working hard, and my mind and strength have been exhausted. This time, I am afraid that I will not be able to win the order of the government. However, I think that if I can work hard for the future of Sino-Japanese friendship, then what is there to be sorry for my personal sacrifice? Therefore, I accept the order and do not stop, and I hope that all talented people will help me from time to time, so that I can use this remnant body to fulfill my duties and repay the country. Xu also recited the phrase "not humiliating the mission", saying that he would do his best to do it. Finally, Xu said that he will go to Shanghai at 5:00 PM on the sixteenth to deploy everything, and come to Beijing again on the nineteenth, and visit Chairman Lin and President Chiang on the twentieth to ask for instructions, and then visit Foreign Minister Zhang to receive his letter of credence. He will take a car to Shanghai on the twenty-first night. How to conduct Sino-Japanese negotiations will be known after asking for instructions. I plan to leave for Japan around the twenty-fifth, if there are seats, at the latest at the end of the month. It is heard that President Chiang will hold a farewell banquet after Xu arrives in Beijing on the nineteenth. As for the accompanying personnel, Secretary Huang Bodu and Hu Mai are determined to go with them. It is internally determined that Councilor Wang Yun Sheng, I heard, will also travel earlier.

<h3>The United States is Devastated by Storms, Snowstorms, and Various Disasters. Traffic is Blocked, and Panic Arises in People's Food. The Temperature Reaches Below Zero. All of Europe is Surrounded in Thick Fog, and Britain is Using Torches to Guide Traffic.</h3>
<p>New York: The storm that has ravaged most of the United States has been rampant for more than a week, and it has expanded even more today. From the Atlantic coast in the east to the Pacific coast in the west, almost all of them have been devastated. Coastal merchant ships have suffered greatly. The British ship "Trolly Snow" is currently in danger in the waters of Oregon, while the American ship "Winslow" capsized off the coast of Boston, killing 14 sailors. New England, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and other states have been snowing heavily, with extremely large hailstones. In the Midwest, food panic has occurred due to traffic jams. There are 11 places in South Dakota that lack fuel and are now waiting for air transport. Earthquakes have occurred again in Helena and Butte. At the same time, the temperature dropped to 25 degrees below Fahrenheit. In Colorado, Texas, and Oklahoma, there are howling winds and sandstorms, even Michigan in the northeast is affected. The temperature in Martha City, Iowa, dropped to 26 degrees below Fahrenheit, and food and fuel are lacking. As for the San Joaquin Valley in California, the flooded area has reached 20,000 acres due to flooding, and Toddle, Plano Nada, and Li Gelang are all flooded. Therefore, the United States is now in the midst of a storm of wind, snow, water, sand, and earthquake disasters. Traffic is blocked and people's food is in great danger.

<p>London: A total of 200 people died in the storm that swept across Europe last week, and 1,000 people were injured. Today, a Jageria train derailed due to frozen tracks, killing 15 more people. (Fourteenth National Telegram)</p>
<p>London: There is a thick fog in Europe, and navigation has stopped. Land and air traffic has also been disrupted. When the Croden Airport in the United Kingdom was shrouded in thick fog, several passenger planes from Europe were in the sky. They could not descend, but they hovered in the sky under the guidance of the no-money telegram. The authorities inquired about seven airports in the United Kingdom, but the replies received all said that the weather was not conducive to the landing of aircraft. So a plane from Amsterdam decided to fly back to Rotterdam, the Netherlands, after being delayed in the sky for half an hour. There was also a plane from Paris that flew back to its departure point. Navigation on the Thames River was stopped. Torches were lit everywhere in Britain to guide traffic. (Fifteenth Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>US-China Legislation Extension</h3>
<p>House Foreign Affairs Committee Passes Extension to May 1st Next Year</p>
<p>Washington – The House Foreign Affairs Committee recently unanimously passed a new Chinese Exclusion Act, extending the effective period of the current Chinese Exclusion Act to May 1st of next year (originally scheduled to expire at the end of this month). The House of Representatives will discuss this bill on the 17th, with debate time limited to only 40 minutes. This bill relates to foreign affairs and has treaty-like characteristics, requiring a two-thirds vote of all members to pass. The bill passed by the House Foreign Affairs Committee today is the same as the one unanimously passed by the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee on the 12th of this month. (Havas dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<p>Washington – The House Foreign Affairs Committee today unanimously passed a proposal to extend the Chinese Exclusion Act to May 1, 1937. The content of this proposal is largely the same as that recently passed by the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee. The original government proposal, which granted the President the power to restrict the export of military supplies to an amount not exceeding peacetime levels, and the two provisions allowing the President to declare that merchants would be responsible for trade with belligerent countries in certain circumstances, have also been removed.

<h3>US House Passes Army Budget</h3>
<p>Amount is Largest in Peacetime</p>
<p>Washington – The House of Representatives today passed the $545,266,000 Army budget by a vote of 204 to 36. (National Telegram of the 14th)</p>
<p>Washington – The Army Department previously submitted a military budget request to the House of Representatives for the 1936-37 fiscal year, totaling $558,027,029.

After being passed by the House of Representatives yesterday, it has now been sent to the Senate. This is reportedly the largest peacetime military budget in American history.

<p>Washington – US Army Chief of Staff General Craig delivered a radio address today, calling for strengthening national defense. He stated that, learning from past lessons, we should all support plans to strengthen national defense. Furthermore, we cannot ignore the serious facts recognized by far-sighted politicians. General Craig called for the US to have a small but powerful national defense force, and a reserve officer corps capable of training and leading the nation's youth in the event of war, and said that we set up this army not to prepare for war, but to maintain peace.

<h3>UK Establishment of Ministry of Defence Plan</h3>
<p>Conservative MP Withdraws Proposal</p>
<p>London – Sir Sothern Holland, a Conservative member of the Lower House, proposed merging the Army, Navy, and Air Force into a Ministry of Defence. The Lower House recently debated the proposal. Lord Paisley, Minister Without Portfolio, on behalf of the government, requested that the matter not be pressed, saying that the Cabinet should adjust Army, Navy, and Air Force affairs to make cooperation closer. The merger was unnecessary. As a result, Sir Sothern Holland withdrew his proposal himself. During the discussion, former Foreign Secretary Austen Chamberlain gave a speech, arguing that the Cabinet should appoint a Minister Without Portfolio to preside over the affairs of the National Defence Committee, saying that, based on his observations, the Prime Minister's duties were heavy, and in the current circumstances, he could not adequately handle the position of Chairman of the Imperial Defence Committee. "We must act with ease. When the Lower House discussed the German Air Force on May 22 last year, the Prime Minister (then Lord President of the Council) admitted that his estimate of the future strength of the German Air Force was completely wrong. By December last year, the Prime Minister also admitted his mistake in the settlement of the Italo-Ethiopian dispute, which relied on the plan devised by Laval and Hoare. Baldwin has admitted his mistakes and asked the Lower House for forgiveness twice. We must do everything possible to prevent such errors from happening again." (Havas News Agency dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<p>London – A member of Parliament introduced a bill advocating the creation of a Ministry of Defence, with the minister responsible for coordinating the work of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. The Lower House debated the bill today, but the motion to pass it on second reading was withdrawn at the request of the government and Sir Austen Chamberlain (who served as Foreign Secretary from November 1924 to June 1929). During the discussion, many important members of various parties were found to be enthusiastically supporting the bill, or amendments to the bill. The mover was Rear Admiral Sueter, a Conservative MP. Sueter emphasized the importance of aerial attacks, saying that bombs dropped from the sky were gradually becoming the main weapon. The government should urgently conduct experiments on the relationship between aerial bombs and warships. The Navy should allocate an old warship and make it unsinkable, and then have aviators bomb it from the sky for testing. Sueter did not believe that anti-aircraft guns could prevent aircraft from bombing warships, and also said that the self-governing colonies should participate in the Ministry of Defence. Speakers following Sueter said that coordinating the work of the Army, Navy, and Air Force could save millions of pounds each year and provide better service. The Imperial Defence Committee has so far failed to cope with this situation. Lord Peacy, Minister without Portfolio, responded on behalf of the government, saying that there must be preparatory work in the middle, that is, the individual administrative departments must agree on a common policy and unite, and then submit it to the Prime Minister for a decision. The government could not express its views on the matter for a while, but the Cabinet would pay attention to this matter and asked the Lower House not to vote on the bill for the time being. Then Sir Austen Chamberlain rose to speak, also advising the Lower House to await the government's recommendations. The knight also engaged in dispelling the public criticism of Prime Minister Baldwin's recent declarations regarding German rearmament and other international military situations, saying that such criticism was based on erroneous information, and that, in view of this kind of statement, major reforms should be made now to avoid the recurrence of such misconceptions. (Reuters dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<p>London – The remarks made by former Foreign Secretary Austen Chamberlain in the Lower House yesterday, although causing the member proposing the establishment of the Ministry of Defence to withdraw the second reading, have attracted great attention in the country. The main point of his remarks was to demand a newer and more efficient national defense organization system, rather than attacking Prime Minister Baldwin. Austen Chamberlain's request was indeed supported. Judging from yesterday's debate in the Lower House, the Lower House's dissatisfaction with the existing national defense organization was already evident. There is indeed a genuine demand for the establishment of the Ministry of Defence at present, but this Ministry of Defence must have the power to coordinate the work of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and be subordinate to a minister who can devote himself to the matter. This view is shared by many parties, so the government will soon find a way to make new arrangements. (Reuters dispatch of the 15th)</p>
<h3>France Renews Air Force</h3>
<p>Aviation Minister Announces Plan</p>
<p>Paris – Aviation Minister Pierre Cot recently made a declaration to the newspapers, saying, "The strength of the French Air Force is worthy of comparison with the air forces of any other European country. This Ministry is now focusing on the renewal of aviation equipment, and it is expected to be largely completed in July of this year. At that time, it will only be necessary to reorganize the replacement of air force armaments and the stockpiling of fuel, and then our work can be said to be complete. However, if our country can conduct negotiations within the scope of the League of Nations, or with friendly and allied countries, in order to jointly maintain peace, that is what I hope for." (Havas dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Oil Embargo Against Italy</h3>
<p>Indefinite Delay Promotes Peace Talks</p>
<p>London – This agency's reporter recently learned from British diplomatic circles that the measure to embargo oil against Italy clearly has a tendency to be extended indefinitely. Therefore, British people believe that negotiations on the issue of peace between Italy and Ethiopia must be restarted. Even those who have always advocated implementing an oil embargo are now making this statement. People in Italy also say that peace talks will begin soon. Although all this is premature, it is also enough to prove that the general public recognizes that the Italo-Ethiopian dispute hinders European peace and therefore urgently wants to resolve it. In addition, British officials claim that the Five-Nation Committee of the League of Nations Administrative Council (namely, the UK, France, Poland, Turkey, and Spain), made a proposal on September 15 last year to resolve the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. Although Italy rejected it on September 25 at that time, its reply stated that if the principle of the League of Nations mandate system was used as a basis, then there might be room for negotiations, so it seems that there is also room for flexibility. Therefore, the above-mentioned proposal may be reconsidered. According to recent news received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ethiopia is gradually running out of armaments, and Italy is also increasingly affected by economic sanctions. This may also make the attitudes of the two countries become more moderate. (Havas dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<p>Rome – The Committee of Experts on the League of Nations oil embargo previously estimated that Italy currently has 1 million tons of oil stored. According to semi-official sources here, the amount of oil stored domestically is actually far more than this number, but the exact number has not been stated. Also, the expert committee's technical discussion of the oil embargo issue was rapid, and it has completed its work in an instant. Semi-official sources are very surprised. The general public believes that the reason why the expert committee completed the matter quickly was to make the Foreign Affairs Committees of the US Senate and House of Representatives respond and make a decision on the oil export issue.

<h3>Rainy Season Approaching, Italian and Ethiopian Armies Active Again</h3>
<p>Addis Ababa, special correspondent of this agency, O'Shaughnessy, reports. According to reliable sources, as the rainy season approaches, both the Italian and Ethiopian armies are eager to do their best to advance and consolidate their positions, so the war on the front lines has become active again. In the northern route, General Gazza's troops of Ethiopia recently engaged in fierce battles with the Italian Blackshirts near Abaco City, northeast of Magale City, hoping to cut off the main road to Adowa City. The losses on both sides are extremely heavy. In the southern route, in the Wogadan region, severe battles continue to occur south of Sassabane City. The city seems to be threatened by the Italian army. Fortunately, the Ethiopian army moved east to attack its flank, so the Italian army may have had to give up its advance and retreat to its original line of defense between Hualhual and Danana, and its forces in the extreme southern province of Sidamo are also constrained. In addition, General Makonnen's troops on the eastern route are said to have been defeated near Hualtel, but details are unknown. (Havas dispatch of the 14th)</p>

<p>Rome – The Third Army, which has been organized secretly for a long time in the northern front line of Ethiopia, was officially announced today. Today's Army Daily officially recognizes this fact and says that General Bastico has been temporarily appointed as the commander of the army. The army is stationed in the Magale area, connecting with General Santini's First Army. It is also reported that the elite Italian troops of Gariboldi will be transported to East Africa to resist the Ethiopian army led by General Babriah. According to military experts, it consists of 190,000 people. (National Telegram of the 14th)</p>

<h3>Outer Mongolian Soldiers and Japanese-Manchukuo Forces Engage in Fierce Battle Again Yesterday for Several Hours</h3>
<p>Soviet Russia Advocates Inviting Neutral Country Representatives to Participate in Organizing Investigation Committee</p>
<p>Changchun – After the serious conflict on the border on Wednesday, there is an atmosphere of preparedness for war in Manchukuo. Recently, there have been warnings in Hailar again, and the situation is becoming more tense. It is said that this morning, thousands of Outer Mongolian troops, carrying guns and cannons, supplemented by four armored vehicles, appeared in the Kakin-su area at the northern end of the Beier River, attacking the Japanese-Manchukuo troops stationed there. Fierce fighting lasted for several hours. The Outer Mongolian soldiers were driven back, and the number of casualties is unknown, but the losses on both sides seem to be not small. The Kwantung Army is currently trying to guard the border strictly to prevent the continued intrusion of Outer Mongolian soldiers. (Reuters dispatch of the 15th)</p>
<p>Moscow – On February 14, the Japanese Ambassador visited the Soviet People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs and handed Deputy Foreign Commissar Maxim Litvinov the Japanese government's reply to the protest issued by Mr. Kaki on January 30, which was issued due to the invasion of the Soviet border by Japanese-Manchukuo forces on the same day. Mr. Litvinov said that the Japanese Ambassador's explanation was a repetition of the completely false propaganda of the Kwantung Army published in the newspapers. Mr. Litvinov angrily rejected this propaganda by the Japanese military authorities, because it was entirely fictitious and slanderous, intended to conceal their true actions. Mr. Litvinov declared that the Japanese authorities stationed in Manchuria, who attacked the Soviet border and created border disputes, are now trying to use this propaganda to deceive the Japanese government and the Japanese people. The Soviet government has various reasons to insist that their reports are absolutely correct. Japanese-Manchukuo forces did cross into Soviet territory on January 30. The conflict between the Japanese-Manchukuo forces and the Soviet border guards occurred on Soviet territory. At that time, the mutinous troops of Manchukuo were also far away from the border, heading to Voroshilov Town, and could not participate in this conflict. The Soviet government hereby confirms its protest and demand made on January 30. Mr. Litvinov mentioned the issue of organizing a mixed commission, saying that the Japanese government, which had previously rejected the Soviet government's proposal to organize a mixed commission to investigate border conflicts, now felt that the February 12 communique of the Far Eastern Red Army Headquarters could be accepted. At the same time, Mr. Litvinov also said that in order for the mixed commission to publish a fair and objective report of the incident, the commission must have representatives from neutral countries participating. This can guarantee the effective work of the commission, promote good relations between the Soviet Union and Japan, and promote peace. Mr. Litvinov hoped that since the Japanese government had declared its willingness to investigate the border incident, it would not oppose the participation of representatives from neutral countries in the mixed commission. The Japanese Ambassador promised to convey Mr. Litvinov's views to the Japanese government. (TASS dispatch of the 15th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – The Yomiuri Shimbun carried a special dispatch from Changchun, stating that the Manchukuo government's committee investigating border disputes today claimed that since February 1932, 91 incidents have occurred on the Russian-Manchukuo border and the Manchukuo-Mongolian border. Among them, only 4 incidents on the Russian-Manchukuo border have been resolved. A total of 44 incidents have occurred on the Manchukuo-Mongolian border, all of which are unresolved. These disputes will increase rather than decrease, because the boundary line is unclear, and the opinions of Russia, Manchukuo, and Mongolia on the demarcation of the border are very different.

<h3>Four-Nation Naval Conference Main Battleship Tonnage Case Stalls Again</h3>
<p>US Does Not Allow Restrictions on Battleship Doctrine / UK's Statement to France is Also Very Vague</p>
<p>London – The current situation of the Naval Conference is full of twists and turns. Major issues, such as the tonnage of main battleships, and the invitation to Germany to sign the future agreement, have made no progress since last Tuesday. Naval figures here believed on the evening of the first day of last week that the UK, France, Italy, and the US had hopes of reaching an agreement. However, since the representatives of France and the US did not contact each other, and the British delegation's statement on the future of the conference was vague, the general impression was that the Naval Conference could have a satisfactory outcome, but in fact, France and Italy advocated the establishment of an agreement under the following two conditions:</p>
<p>1.  After the establishment of the Four-Nation Agreement, it would be sent to Germany and other countries, asking them to sign and participate separately.</p>
<p>2.  The UK and the US would be allowed to build two 35,000-ton main battleships. Once the six-year term of the agreement expires, this tonnage would be reduced. This in the US, practically, has only allowed future consideration, never immediately agreed to implement. When it was mistakenly reported that the Four-Nation Naval Agreement had been established on Tuesday of last week, France and Italy immediately expressed their opposition, and thus the opposing views were fully exposed. In short, regarding the issue of main battleship tonnage, the US has always refused to reduce it below 35,000 tons. Under these circumstances, France has refused to continue the discussion. In addition, after the representatives of the UK and Italy met once yesterday, it has been proven that Italy supports France's views regarding the issue of main battleship tonnage. The future of the Naval Conference is thus more difficult. In addition, French Ambassador to the UK Corbin and Italian Navy Rear Admiral Piscaccia have returned to their countries one after another, which also shows that the situation of the Naval Conference is difficult to make people optimistic. (Havas dispatch of the 15th)</p>
<p>London – According to what this agency's reporter knows, the Naval Conference is about to announce its end because the countries concerned have not yet reached a compromise on the issue of main battleship tonnage. French Ambassador to the UK Corbin and Italian Navy Rear Admiral Piscaccia returned to their respective countries one after another to report to their governments on the current basis of discussion on the issue of main battleship tonnage, in order to determine whether the two countries need to withdraw from the conference on this basis. (Havas dispatch of the 15th)</p>
<p>London – French Ambassador to the UK Corbin held a long talk with Foreign Secretary Eden today, and then left for his country at 4:00 pm to report the latest developments in the Naval Conference to French Foreign Minister Flandin, and to ask the Foreign Minister about the steps that the French delegation should take in the future. People in both the UK and France did not agree on Corbin's trip. However, according to what is known from the Naval Conference, the recent talks between the UK and France discussed not only the issue of qualitative restrictions (referring to the issue of main battleship tonnage), but also the political issues raised by the issue of Germany signing and participating in the future agreement. This is why Corbin needed to return to his country to ask for instructions. It is now known that Corbin will return here next Tuesday, and the Naval Conference negotiations can then be carried out effectively. (Havas News Agency dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<p>London – The Naval Conference has once again fallen into a stalemate due to the unresolved issue of main battleship tonnage. People in the conference even believe that the conference may fail completely in the middle of next week, because the US insists on setting the limit of 35,000 tons for main battleship tonnage and refuses to reduce it. France and Italy believe that this goes against the purpose of the Naval Conference to reduce armaments and refuse to accept it. Although France is willing to make concessions and is prepared to consider numbers below 35,000 tons, the US has always insisted on its previous statement. As for the UK, it has only proposed a compromise plan for the calibre of the main battleship guns, that is, reducing it from 16 inches to 14 inches (this level can be achieved after the Washington Naval Treaty expires at the end of this year, but only if Japan accepts it). However, since this British proposal does not involve tonnage, it is not enough to save the stalemate. (Havas dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Newspapers Comment on the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact</h3>
<p>Saying that it is Sufficient to Guarantee World Peace</p>
<p>Moscow – An Izvestia editorial said that the French government, regardless of the rude expressions of the German newspapers, Germany is about to recognize the Locarno Treaty, and has proposed to Parliament to approve the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact. The newspapers of the Japanese military circles also hold a hostile attitude towards the Franco-Soviet Pact. The recent Soviet-Manchukuo and Manchukuo-Mongolian border incidents also clearly coincided with the intention of the Japanese military circles to supply the enemy of the pact with evidence that the Soviet Union is not trustworthy, that is, that the Soviet Union has been constrained by the emergency situation in the Far East and no longer has sufficient strength to defend Western peace. The madness of German fascism and the actions of the Japanese military circles best prove that the Franco-Soviet Pact is of great significance to consolidating world peace. It seems strange that some people in France, which is most concerned about maintaining peace, are also opposed to the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact. We must pay attention to the fact that the declaration of German fascists opposing the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact influences the right-wing elements in France, and the opposition of the French right-wing elements to the pact is used by German fascists as another reason to coerce the French political circles and prevent them from approving the pact. The newspaper denied the right-wing's claim that the conclusion of the pact was proposed by the Soviet Union, saying that the proposal and conclusion of this pact should be attributed to Bartou. "The Soviet government agreed to Bartou's proposal not because the Soviet Union could not defend its borders with its own military force. We rely first on our own military force, as the two leaders Stalin and Molotov said at the 17th Congress of the Communist Party, to consolidate national defence to resist any strong enemies. But although we can and must defend the Soviet border with our own military force, we cannot rely solely on our own strength to maintain peace. Therefore, it is necessary to unite the major powers that maintain peace, because only this great alliance for peace can make the powers that intend to re-divide the world feel a great danger and prompt them to reflect before they carry out aggression. France and the Soviet Union do not want to conclude any power blocs. They have invited all the powers to participate in the peace organization, but Germany and Poland's refusal to participate in the Mutual Assistance Pact has forced France and the Czech Republic to conclude Mutual Assistance Pacts with the Soviet Union respectively. German fascism attacks the Mutual Assistance Pact, which is the most important political step to strike at the policy of consolidating peace between France and the Soviet Union. Those in France who oppose this pact are helping German fascism to achieve its goals. The decision of the French Parliament on the issue of the pact is sufficient to influence the fate of collective security in Europe. Only by approving the pact can those who are preparing for war know that there are still some forces preparing to guarantee peace, and it is not easy to disperse them. Facts over the past few years have proven that Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant is merely a formality without Mutual Assistance Pacts. It is hoped that the French Parliament will understand that the security of France and other neighboring European countries will depend on their decision." (TASS dispatch of the 15th)</p>
<h3>Sino-U.S. Gold and Silver Transactions</h3>
<p>America Gains a Strong Ally in Asia</p>
<p>Washington - Currency experts here believe that after the United States purchased a large quantity of silver from China, America has gained a strong ally in Asia in the global currency battle. At the same time, China's currency will also be linked to the U.S. dollar because China's existing deposit of $32,000,000 in New York can stabilize its currency's exchange rate against the dollar for a long period. Although China also has similar deposits in London, it cannot stop the delight of the currency experts here. In their view, this move has allowed China to maintain a neutral position between the U.S. dollar and the British pound. It is expected that China's currency will be fully linked to the U.S. dollar. It is generally felt here that the reason why the United States wants to manipulate the world's exchange rates and trade is that more than twenty countries are cooperating with it in currency matters. However, in this kind of currency war, if China can establish a relationship with the U.S. dollar or refuse to join the sterling bloc, then the United States' $200 million stabilization fund will be more than enough to balance America's international balance of payments. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>Washington - Business circles today believe that the Chinese government can use part of the U.S. dollars obtained from selling silver to the U.S. Treasury to purchase railway or other materials in the United States. However, well-informed sources believe that if China's trade with the United States can maintain its recent tendency towards a trade surplus, then China will have no need to use this sum of U.S. dollars. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>Washington - An Associated Press reporter learned today that the United States is now trying to stabilize China's finances. The reason is that the United States' past purchases of large quantities of silver from China almost bankrupted China's financial system. In the future, it should do its best to provide support. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau also hopes that the relationship between China's currency and the world market will become stable. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>
<h3>Hull Advocates Equal Trade Opportunities</h3>
<p>To Avoid War, Germany Wants to Increase Exports</p>
<p>Washington - Secretary of State Hull recently delivered a radio address, advocating that all countries should have equal trade opportunities in order to avoid the dangers of war. He said, "If all countries achieve economic prosperity and benefit from each other through trade, then feelings of fear and suspicion will be reduced. Even if the leaders of various countries want to encourage their people to seek solutions to economic suffering through war, their people will not be so willing to comply as they are now." (Havas News Agency, 14th)</p>
<p>Dr. Schacht, the Economics Minister of Bremen, Germany, recently gave the opening address at the local Economic Association and gave a speech saying, "We must find ways to increase the amount of exports, which cannot be delayed, as only after the increase in exports, the raw materials we need can be imported continuously. On the contrary, if the currency price is devalued, then the fat, cotton, and metal products we need will have no way to be purchased. In short, what we are now trying to solve is not a monetary issue, but a goods issue, only through hard work, and a frugal lifestyle, then the future will have a bright day."

<h3>Syrian Nationalist Movement Severely Suppressed by the French</h3>
<p>Martel Issues Statement</p>
<p>The Syrian conflict in Homs remains serious. According to Damascus, machine guns are densely arranged in various streets and rooftops, and the situation inside the city is no different from being besieged. Army Commander General Hansen has ordered that groups of more than four people are not allowed to parade. In the past few days, the number of deaths and injuries caused by riots in various places has been considerable. The strike wave has now spread to the cities of Beirut and Lebanon. The people of Damascus are becoming more and more revolutionary in their thinking due to the lack of food and various vegetables. The work of the Citizens' Food Distribution Committee is becoming increasingly difficult. Nationalist Party leader Xiang Xin believes that if the Iraqi government is willing to speak out for the Syrian people, then the French administration may be more moderate. The main figures of the revolutionary movement have begun to flee to Jebel Druze to avoid being arrested by the French authorities. At the same time, they claim that they will organize plainclothes teams to engage in civil war. Due to the opposition of Muslims, the French authorities have stopped using the Senegalese Tirailleurs Black troops. It is said that the French authorities have requested an additional 10,000 troops from their home country, and it is reported that the first batch of reinforcements will arrive on the 19th. The general strike is still continuing, but given the strict precautions taken by the military authorities and the harsh measures used, it is expected that it will soon disappear. The total losses from the strike are now estimated to be over four million pounds. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>Recently, nationalist factions in Damascus, Syria, have been causing trouble within Syria. The French High Commissioner in Syria, Mr. Martel, recently told our reporter, "France has ample power and its governance here is more than benevolent. Once the disturbances are quelled and normalcy is restored, I will be able to identify who is the culprit, who uses sophistry to deceive the public and incite incidents, and who blindly follows like lost lambs without knowing where to return. The Syrian issue is indeed complex. Those who hold nationalist views use deceitful words to deceive the public, leading to instability in the political situation, and increasing the difficulty of economic and financial matters, causing the people to suffer. This is the truth. Only in an atmosphere of mutual trust and cooperation can the problems of minorities be solved and international relations be improved. It is a pity that the general politicians, although they claim to be patriots, avoid the policy of cooperation themselves and do not allow others to do it. How can this be done!"

<h3>Illegal Acts Continue in Japanese Election Battles</h3>
<p>Voting Begins on Remote Islands</p>
<p>Tokyo - The war of words and documents in the general election has now reached its climax. Looking at the situation in various places, due to the government's crackdown on elections, the situation is chaotic and cannot be predicted. Although the government expects the government party to win based on the expected number of elected members of the Minseito and Showakai parties, in fact, there is no basis for confidence. On the surface, it pretends to be optimistic, but internally, it has a sense of unease about the changes in the political situation after the election. On the Seiyukai side, because it is in an unfavorable position as an opposition party, it has not gained confidence in victory. This kind of anxiety and anxiety can be glimpsed in the battle between the government party and the opposition party. Therefore, acts that violate the election law have continued to occur in various places recently. As this evolves, when the election battle enters its final stage, bribery of votes, visits to voter's homes, and other illegal acts will inevitably increase. The police authorities are now on guard against this point and are making every effort to crack down on illegal acts. (Domei News Agency, 15th)</p>

<h3>Order of Royal Toasts in England</h3>
<p>London - Officials announced that King Edward VIII has now approved the proposal of Home Secretary Sir John Simon regarding the order in which toasts are made to the royal family's health at official and public banquets. The order is as follows: first the King, then Queen Mary (i.e. the Queen Mother), then the Duke and Duchess of York, and then other members of the royal family. The Duke of York (the late King George's second son) is the heir to the throne. His successors are as follows: Princess Elizabeth (the Duke of York's eldest daughter, nine years old), Princess Margaret (the Duke of York's younger daughter, five years old), the Duke of Gloucester (the late King's third son), the Duke of Kent (the late King's fourth son), the Duke of Kent's son, born four months ago, and Princess Mary (the late King's daughter). If King Edward VIII marries in the future and has children, then his children will have priority in succession, not the Duke of York. If King Edward remains single and unmarried, then Princess Elizabeth will have the opportunity to become the Queen of England in the future, but if the Duke of York has a son, then his daughters, even if they are older, will not be able to inherit the throne.

<h3>All-Purpose Electric Calculator Installed in the Department of Health</h3>
<p>Nanjing - The all-purpose electric calculating machine invented by the United States was escorted to Nanjing by Bain, manager of the Group Department of IBM, and installed in the Department of Health. According to Mr. Bain and Western engineer Stone and Chinese engineers Shi Dongdiqi and Li Houzai, after the machine was successfully manufactured in the United States, a similar machine was transported to China. After arriving at the end of last year, it was installed in a month. After days of testing, it was found to be accurate and fast. It is currently applying for a patent from the U.S. government, so it is not for sale in China. The price has not yet been determined. Bain will return to the United States at the end of this year, and the management of the machine will be the responsibility of Shi, Chen, Diqi and Li Houzai. This machine has not yet been installed in Japan. The statistics of various agencies in Nanjing are calculated on this machine. The work of sorting, proofreading and copying can also be done with ease. Other things such as commercial bills and electricity bills from electricity plants can be calculated and processed by this machine. Currently, the machine's instructions have not yet been translated. After the translation is completed, various circles will be invited to visit at a specific time. The machine has five parts: the first part is the punching machine and the proofreading machine. Punching is the most important work of this machine. No matter what statistics or numbers, they are all represented by numbers, printed on cards. Once the punch is pressed, it becomes the original manuscript. Then it is sent to the proofreading machine, and if there are no errors in the punching, it can be pushed. If there is an error in a word, it will stop immediately. After the proofreading is completed, it is sent to the copying typewriter to supplement the procedures, and then the card analysis machine analyzes the types. Regardless of the messy colors of more than a dozen types, once the motor is turned on, they can be distributed one by one. For example, ten red ones and fifty white ones can be placed in separate grids. There is a hole at the top of each to show how many sheets are there, and any sheet can be specified from the messy sheets. For example, if the fiftieth sheet is needed, it can be taken out by the machine immediately, checked and obtained. Then it is sent to the tabulating machine printing machine to create a table of the desired statistical results and print it into a form. The number of sheets printed is completely marked. In addition, there is a multiplier calculator. No matter what kind of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, once a table goes in, the addition is pressed, and the number is marked on the wheel axis. Therefore, no matter what large-scale statistics, with this machine, the results can be obtained quickly and accurately. Therefore, everything that can be calculated or printed by the five parts of the machine can be completed by this machine. It is truly a powerful tool for calculation. (Special Dispatch, 15th)</p>

The highest price of dry land in plains was 200 yuan, the average was 25 yuan, and the lowest was 1 yuan. The highest price of dry land on hillsides was 100 yuan, the average was 13 yuan, and the lowest was none. As for the changes in land prices in various provinces over the years, if 1931 is taken as 100, then the index of land price changes between 1931 and 1934 shows a decrease of 18% for paddy fields, a decrease of 17% for plains, and a decrease of 18% for hillsides. This is a sign of the increasing decline of our country's rural areas. (Central News Agency, 15th)</p>

<h3>Biological Surveys and Research That the Country Urgently Needs to Conduct (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Hu Xian</p>
<p>About Research on Horticultural Plants</p>
<p>The scope of horticulture is extremely broad, mainly including fruit trees, vegetables, and flowers. Although China's fruit industry is quite developed, it is far behind Europe, America, and Japan. The waiting cultivation of summer-ripening citrus and Western cherries is an example. In addition, there are many kinds of famous foreign fruits that can be imported, and there are also many kinds of wild fruits in China that can be improved, such as kiwi fruit and various raspberries. At present, the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute, due to the greatness of its cause and the lack of manpower and financial resources, has no time to study this, but it should also be valued. Vegetable horticulture research does not need special attention in China, but flower horticulture research should be vigorously promoted. China is located in the temperate zone, and the number of plant species is the crown of the world's temperate zone. Famous flowers and rare plants, there are many kinds. It has the reputation of being a flower country. Every year, major botanical or horticultural institutions in Europe and the United States send experts to China to collect plants and import seeds in an endless stream. For example, the genus Rhododendron produces more than 500 species worldwide, and more than 300 species are produced in China. Other genera also say that in Europe and America, there is no garden without Chinese flowers. And China itself only sticks to the varieties planted in the past. Since the opening of the sea, it has competed to plant foreign flowers, and even domestic varieties are turned over to foreigners for re-import. A British scientist once said that with China's cheap labor and the abundance of flower and tree species, if large-scale breeding of flowers and vegetables is carried out in the Yangtze River basin, it can monopolize the world's seed industry. At the same time, there are still many famous and exotic flowers in foreign countries that have not been imported and cultivated. However, today's domestic horticulturists are few and far between, and there are only two or three breeding experts in the whole country. Now, fortunately, Lushan Forest Botanical Garden has a large area and extremely capable technicians in charge. The government should urgently provide assistance, and it will not be difficult to make it follow in the footsteps of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, England, and develop into the first botanical garden in East Asia.</p>
<p>About Research on Medicinal Plants</p>
<p>China has a large number of plant species, so the ancients studied medicines very early, and there are also very rich special medicines. Only because the classics are not scientifically organized, they are not trusted by those who practice new medicine. China imports 60 million yuan of raw drugs every year; and such as rhubarb and licorice are native to China, but because there are no pharmaceutical factories to manufacture and scientific methods to test them, foreigners exploit our people a lot with a single turnover. Other examples include aconite and gentian and polygala. Although the types produced in China are different from those produced in Europe and the United States, their effects are similar. However, they have not been researched and standardized, so they are rejected by new medicine. As for ephedra, it has been studied by the Xiehe Medical School and has become the world's sacred medicine, and Codonopsis pilosula, Ligusticum chuanxiong, Angelica sinensis, and Pinellia ternata have been repeatedly studied by scientists, and their effects have been demonstrated. However, there are still many drugs that have not been studied. Today, the most difficult thing in studying Chinese drugs is to identify their species. There are many types of Chinese drugs, such as gentian, which has more than 100 species, and aconite, which also has 7 species. What species are sold on the market? If there is no botanist to collect and cultivate fresh varieties for research, pharmacologists and chemists will not be able to determine their varieties, and the results of their research cannot be determined, and there is no way to manufacture them on a large scale. Only by having botanical research institutions hire pharmaceutical experts to collect, cultivate, and research together can accurate results be obtained. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Educational Broadcast Special History Lecture Foreign History (1) Professor Shen Gang of Central University</p>
<p>The middle school curriculum has long included foreign history, but everyone has always not paid much attention to the subject. Students think that if they open a Western history textbook and recognize every character, they say it is easy and look down on it. Those who run schools also think that the value of the subject is far below English and mathematics, so according to the points to calculate the salary, the history teacher always gets less money than the mathematics and English teachers. There are also many principals who even take the foreign history hours as a favor and casually assign them to other teachers to兼任 as their subsidies. Six years ago, a preparatory department director of a certain university openly said to the students: "Is Western history worth learning! Who doesn't know Washington and Napoleon?" People like this who preside over the school certainly did not invite a person who has researched foreign history to teach Western history, and they will never think of ways to promote students' interest in reading foreign history. As a result, foreign history in middle schools is completely equivalent to a sham.</p>
<p>In recent years, this situation has been slightly better in schools. However, there are still many people in society who criticize the teaching of foreign history in middle schools. Summarizing their arguments, there are about three types: one is saying: "Foreigners' strengths are natural sciences; what we lack is also natural sciences. We can save the country by learning foreign science. As for foreign history, it is other people's past events and has nothing to do with us. Learning it cannot enrich the country and strengthen the army, nor is it enough to make a living. What is the use of wasting time in vain?" Another type of people say: "The study of history is vast as the ocean. We don't even know where to start with our own Twenty-Four Histories, so where do we have the time to learn other people's history? The middle school curriculum is already particularly large, and students feel that time is not enough to study English and mathematics all day long. Is it not ignoring the importance of things and making students suffer in vain to ask them to learn foreign history again! Foreign history should be left to a few people with leisure in universities to do specialized research. Young middle school students really don't need to care about it." Another type of people say: "Material civilization is not divided into Chinese and foreign, and everyone can use it, so we should learn from foreigners' strengths. As for spiritual culture, various ethnic groups cannot be forced to be the same. Learning from others is always painting a tiger and failing to achieve the result. To revive the nation, we must find a way out from our own history in order to carry forward the national glory. The various imported ideas and doctrines do not conform to national conditions. Learning them is not only useless but also harmful. Foreign history is full of such theories and facts that do not conform to China's national conditions, so how can we let middle school students with not fully developed judgment learn it!"</p>
<p>Most of the people who make these three propositions have lived in middle schools before and of course have also learned foreign history. Their current arguments can further prove that the foreign history curriculum in middle schools in the past was indeed completely ineffective. However, this is not because foreign history itself is not good, but because the result of learning foreign history without getting the method right. This is the responsibility of the teachers themselves! It is like rice is something that nourishes people, but if it is not cooked well, it can also make people sick. We should improve the cooking method, not say that we will never eat rice again.</p>
<p>The first type of people argue for saving the country with science, which is extremely correct. But if it is said that what China needs now is only natural science, and there is nothing else, then that is completely wrong! Today's science almost all originated in Greece, so why couldn't the Greeks use their scientific ideas to improve their material environment? Chinese people invented the compass and armillary sphere long ago, and knew how to make paper and print books long ago. Why is material civilization still so backward? Europe, in the eighteenth century, produced many scientists, why did the industrial revolution still occur after England? It can be seen that relying solely on a few great scientists still cannot popularize science, and having only a few scientific inventions still cannot strengthen the country and enrich the people. If the people do not have the spirit of applying science, and the society does not have the organization to develop science, science will never develop. Even if you learn a little bit of fur, it is useless. The exterior of the Beiyang Navy in the past was more majestic and beautiful than the Japanese warships at the time, but when the war started, it was still a complete defeat. Is the responsibility for the defeat in the Sino-Japanese War solely borne by the navy at that time? Airplanes and anti-aircraft guns had already been used in the European War, and until the time of the January 28th Incident, Chinese people still had to advocate what flying arrows and flying thunder. Do you think there is still any hope for the development of science in this atmosphere of saving the country with flying arrows and saving the country with broadswords! If we really want to use foreign science to save the country now, the first thing we must do is to get rid of this extremely unscientific mentality and cultivate the spirit of pursuing the truth; the second thing is to create a society that can apply science and cultivate an environment suitable for the development of science. However, these prerequisites cannot be solved by science itself. We must study other people's history, see how their scientific culture was successful, and follow suit step by step, and there may be hope. Therefore, young students must not only learn mathematics, physics, and chemistry on the one hand as a preparation for learning advanced science in the future, but also learn foreign history on the other hand to reform our unscientific traditional thinking and cultivate the same scientific spirit as foreigners.</p>
<p>Furthermore, people who do not understand social science have narrow views and cannot fully utilize natural science. Therefore, Westerners, whether they study medicine or engineering, must first receive a type of "liberal education" that emphasizes history in order to broaden their views and cultivate their judgment. There are no scientific experts in foreign countries who do not have world common sense. At present, there are many people in China who study science who are erudite. However, there are still some who lack common sense. I once met a shipbuilding engineer who insisted that Indians are a "species"; I saw a doctor of medicine who insisted that Italy was unified only after Mussolini came to power; and I also saw a pilot who insisted that the spirit of Japan's founding was the same as England. These gentlemen's specialized skills are all very good, but can they fully utilize science to save the country with such common sense? What we need now are scientists who understand the world's major trends, not machine craftsmen who are slaves to material things. Machine craftsmen are certainly useful, but would it make a country if all middle school students were made into machine craftsmen? If you want to be a scientist who is above machine craftsmen, you must have a foundation in social science. It goes without saying that world history occupies the most important position in social science.</p>
<p>What I have said are all the academic values of foreign history. Now I want to talk about its greater use. The purpose of our reading is not only to seek knowledge, but also to cultivate personality and edify the soul. In other words, it is to learn to be a complete person. Originally, any learning, when talked about to the highest and most profound level, can be used as a resource for improving virtue. But this is not something that ordinary novice youths can understand. Because young people's psychology does not like abstract, circuitous, mysterious, and esoteric theories. It is best to give him a concrete example, and he will be convinced at first sight and gradually be influenced. Having said that, isn't foreign history — including — the best for 　　　　　　youth? Because: First, its content is mostly records of exhorting good and punishing evil, which can be used as material for us to observe and hone. We know the words and deeds of sages, heroes, loyal ministers, and righteous men, and we will naturally yearn for them; we understand the true spirit of various national movements and social movements, and we will naturally be filled with enthusiasm and want to work hard and make progress. In general, people who are particularly successful in their careers and scholarship have always chosen a great ancient person as their ideal standard in their lives, thinking of him and following his footsteps, and over time, their virtue and career will naturally improve day by day. Second, the purpose of history is to pursue the truth. Its methods are objective, comparative, analytical, and inductive. Its 　論 is in line with reason; its judgment is absolutely logical. If we are good at reading history, we can naturally develop the habits of precise observation and clear analysis; the psychology of emphasizing objectivity and removing our own views; and the attitude of not being long and polite and basing on reason. If we can do this in dealing with people and doing things, aren't we special and independent people? Therefore, Lessing of Germany said, "History is the education of mankind, and it is the foundation of humanities education." This gentleman is not a dedicated historian, so his words are certainly not biased in favor of history, pleasing what it likes. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Robbery Occurs in Welcome Dragon Township, Songjiang</h3>
<p>In Welcome Dragon Township, Punan, at the home of Sun Yongxiang, household number nine of the first sub-section of the third section, three or four bandits broke down the front door and robbed the premises the night before last. They tied up the homeowner one by one, arbitrarily looted the house, and then left through the front door, fleeing southeast. The homeowner, considering the stolen goods to be of little value, was unwilling to report to the authorities to avoid further conflict with the bandits. However, the Ninth Sub-station of the Public Security Bureau learned of the incident, investigated the scene, and reported the details to the county bureau on the 15th, ordering an arrest.</p>
<p>Successive Deaths of Suzhou Prison Inmates</p>
<p>The Third Branch Prison of the Provincial Court of Justice, attached to the Gao Gao Court Detention Center, accommodates both detainees and those awaiting judgment. The original quota for both locations was only 500 people. In recent years, due to the large number of inmates, the number of prisoners has exceeded more than double that limit. Recently, an outbreak of acute pulmonary disease was discovered within the prison. In January, 30 people died. This month, up to the 15th, 18 people have already died within half a month, indicating a trend of widespread contagion. Most of the sick are kidnappers and thieves. According to the doctors, these people generally have strong constitutions, but suffered non-judicial punishments during their arrest, resulting in lung injuries. This, coupled with the unsanitary conditions of the detention center, caused the disease.</p>
<p>Kunshan Commends Brave Police Officers for Apprehending Bandits</p>
<p>In Zhengyi Gaolu Township, Kunshan County, the home of Zhou Changhua, the head of the second sub-section of the fifth section, was raided by more than ten bandits late at night on the first of this month. The head of the sub-section, realizing the situation was dire, seized the opportunity to escape and raise the alarm. Fortunately, the village alliance had already been organized, and neighboring villages responded to the call for help. As a result, eight bandits were captured, along with their firearms, and handed over to the judiciary for interrogation. It is now known that the Public Security Bureau believes that the division chief police officer has been conscientious in his duties, guiding the sub-section heads, and imparting military knowledge. The achievement of the farmers in capturing the bandits was outstanding. The chief police officers were all commended. The township chief Zhu Daoxiang, and the sub-section head Zhou Changhua, assisted in the capture of the bandits with commendable bravery. The bureau awarded them prizes to encourage them.</p>
<p>Changzhou Expands the Construction of New Feng Road</p>
<p>In Wuyi, the New Feng Road, from outside the city gate to the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Station, has seen increasing prosperity. The original road has been damaged and is too narrow. The county government previously drafted a plan and budget for the repair and expansion of the road and submitted it to the Construction Department for approval. It is now scheduled for bidding on the 26th of this month, to be held publicly in the county government auditorium, with personnel dispatched by the Construction Department to oversee the process to ensure fairness. Furthermore, the road surface is currently planned to be 16 meters wide. Residents requested that the width be reduced to 14 meters, with the residents themselves bearing the cost of demolishing any houses, and submitted this request to the county government for approval. County Magistrate Hou believes that the request has some merit and intends to forward it to the department for review.</p>
<p>Wuxi Carpentry Apprentice Dies from Injury</p>
<p>The Taifeng Rice and Grain Shop, inside the East City Gate, is opened by Wang Xingyao from Jingjiang. Last winter, the shop was unexpectedly destroyed by fire, resulting in the destruction of four buildings. Recently, the landlord, Hua Weixin, arranged for reconstruction, which was contracted to the Desen carpentry workshop in the South Gate area. In the morning of the previous day, the carpentry workshop head, Xing Bao, ordered his apprentice, Lu Xin’nan from Xinnan, and several partners to transport lumber to the construction site. Lu and Yu, two apprentices, were carrying a piece of lumber together when, while passing through the East City Gate, the lumber collided with the city wall due to a sharp turn. Lu Xin’nan’s head was violently struck, causing him to fall to the ground, unconscious and bleeding profusely. Yu Genxiang was also injured. Lu was taken to Pushi Hospital for treatment, but he died shortly after arriving due to severe brain trauma. Yu sustained minor injuries and his life is not in danger. On the 15th, Wu Shuntai, the director of the Northeast Fifth Ward, reported the incident to the court for an autopsy. Prosecutor Shen, accompanied by officials, conducted the autopsy and confirmed that the death was caused by the impact injury. He ordered the carpentry workshop head, Xing Bao, to prepare a coffin for the burial.</p>
<p>Yangzhou Boy Scout Inspection Group Returns to Yangzhou</p>
<p>The Boy Scout community in this province formed a Japanese scouting educational investigation group to inspect the scouting operations in Japan for reference. The group departed from Shanghai on the 18th of last month aboard the Shanghai Maru to cross the sea to Japan. It is now known that the group has completed its investigation in Japan and returned to the country recently. Du Zhaotang, Wang Cheng, Huang Youqian, and Wang Meng’e, participants from Yangzhou, have arrived in Yangzhou successively. According to Du, the trip was very successful. The group visited seven major cities in Japan, including Tokyo, Yokohama, Kyoto, Nara, Osaka, Kobe, and Nagasaki, and inspected 15 scouting education institutions and corps, eight schools, ten parks, one naval port, one warship, and one newspaper office. They also visited 47 scenic spots. The group has now drafted a detailed report on the investigation, which will be published after minor revisions.</p>
<p>Xiaoshan Prison Inmates Appeal to the Supervising Censor</p>
<p>A prisoner, Ni, at the Xiaoshan Local Court Prison, reported to Supervising Censor Chen on the 11th, while the latter was inspecting the facility, that Clerk Ke was abusing the prisoners. It was reported that the prisoner’s meals were allegedly 18 taels (approx. 672 grams) according to market measures, which were not enough to satisfy hunger. The guards allegedly charged 11 copper coins for a postcard and 11 copper coins for a pack of tobacco. When converting silver dollars to copper coins, they were only worth 2,800 copper coins. If the prisoners complained, Clerk Ke would allegedly beat them or impose shackles and other forms of oppression. It was alleged that the guards divided the money earned and the profits from reducing prisoners' food rations among themselves at the end of each month, all managed by Clerk Ke. The prisoners felt that the various forms of abuse were unbearable. Therefore, they appealed to the Supervising Censor for relief and to safeguard the prisoners' rights. It is reported that Supervising Censor Chen Shengying ordered the local court to conduct a thorough investigation and report back in accordance with the law after receiving the report.</p>

<p>China-Japan Wireless Telephone Held Formal Communication Ceremony Yesterday</p>
<p>Mr. Peng Xuepei Delivered Opening Remarks, Central Representative Gave Instructions, Chinese and Japanese Leaders Exchanged Congratulations, Clear Voice Quality Due to Fine Weather, Public Communication Officially Began at Noon</p>
<p>The International Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, the International Wireless Radio Station, and the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, under orders to jointly organize the China-Japan Shanghai-Tokyo wireless telephone service, after three months of testing, achieved exceptionally satisfactory results. Therefore, at 9:00 AM yesterday, a communication ceremony was held at the Zhabei Telephone Branch Bureau on Yongxing Road in this city. Public communication officially opened at noon. Details of the ceremony are as follows:</p>
<p>Simple Venue Arrangement</p>
<p>The venue was set up in the long-distance telephone room on the second floor of the Zhabei Telephone Branch Bureau, with a very simple arrangement. The wireless communication room was next door. The national flags of China and Japan were hung high on the wall. A telephone was placed on the conference table, equipped with multiple headphones for participants to use.</p>
<p>Participation of Chinese and Japanese Representatives</p>
<p>Those who participated in the communication ceremony included representatives from the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government Executive Yuan, Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Vice Minister of Communications Peng Xuepei, Director of the Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Gao Zongwu representing the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Director of the Shanghai Office Zhou Jue, Japanese Acting Ambassador Yosuke Sugimura, Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai Ishii, Japanese Consul-General in Nanjing Suma, Chairman of the China-Japan Trade Association Zhou Zuomin, Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Yu Zuoting, President of the Central News Agency Xiao Tongzi, and guests Huang Boqiao, Guo Bingwen, Ling Hongji, as well as reporters from Chinese and Japanese newspapers, totaling more than sixty or seventy people, who were received by personnel from the bureau.</p>
<p>Mr. Peng Delivers Opening Remarks</p>
<p>At 9:30 AM, the communication ceremony began.</p>
<p>It was presided over by Peng Xuepei, Vice Minister of Communications, with Lu Hongxun as the master of ceremonies. After the customary rituals, Chairman Peng Xuepei delivered the opening remarks, saying, "Today marks the opening of the China-Japan wireless telephone service. I am honored to be here on behalf of the Ministry to hold this opening ceremony. Telecommunications have made significant progress in the past decade. Communication methods are constantly being updated. Telegraphs and telephones have evolved from wired to wireless, and from domestic to international communication. More comprehensive international communication is a cause for celebration in human culture. China and Japan share the same race and culture, and various relationships are very close. However, two years ago, the two countries relied solely on a few submarine cables to exchange telegrams, which was inconvenient. On June 1, 1934, the direct China-Japan wireless telegraph service was opened, providing another channel for telecommunications between China and Japan. On October 22 of last year, the measures for China-Japan wireless telephone communication were established. In just three months, we have achieved the opening of the service today, which is the result of the joint efforts of both sides. In the future, the people of both countries will surely increase understanding and eliminate misunderstandings through this new connection. The economic relations between the two countries will certainly become more efficient, and the diplomatic relations between the two countries will be able to better understand and respect each other, jointly consolidate peace and cooperation, and jointly promote Eastern culture. This must be the common hope of the people of both countries."</p>
<p>Instructions from the Central Representative</p>
<p>Following that, Wu Tiecheng, Mayor of Shanghai, representative of the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government Executive Yuan, delivered instructions, saying, "Today, I am greatly honored to respectfully represent the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government Executive Yuan, to participate in the China-Japan wireless telephone communication ceremony. I would like to express my personal thoughts in lieu of congratulations. China and Japan are separated by a narrow strip of water. The various means of transportation are already very complete. Now, with the addition of wireless telephones, the distance between China and Japan will be further shortened, allowing the people of both countries to communicate as if they were in the same hall, which can further promote the relationship between the two countries and increase the friendship between the two countries. Therefore, the success of China-Japan communication can be said to be a new era in the history of diplomatic relations. We hope that the people of China and Japan, due to the closer relationship between China and Japan and the more complete means of transportation, will, through the greatest efforts of both countries, make diplomatic relations closer and the people more intimate. As the ancient saying goes, 'Be kind to your relatives and be good neighbors.' We should use various methods to achieve this. Now that communication has been successful, it can be said to be a precursor to closer ties between the two countries. I hereby offer this as a congratulatory message."</p>
<p>Mr. Sugimura's Speech</p>
<p>Following that, the Japanese Acting Ambassador to China, Yosuke Sugimura, gave a speech in Japanese, the general meaning of which was also that after the China-Japan wireless telephone communication, diplomatic relations would become more harmonious. He then announced the end of the ceremony and invited the guests to tea and refreshments. It was only 9:40 AM, still twenty minutes away from the scheduled communication time. At 10:00 AM, Peng Xuepei, Wu Tiecheng, Gao Zongwu, Yosuke Sugimura, Zhou Zuomin, Yu Zuoting, Xiao Tongzi, Wen Yuqing and others entered the communication room.</p>
<p>Communication Began with Tokyo</p>
<p>Each person was limited to three minutes. Yesterday, the weather was fine and the voice quality was very clear. Acting Minister of Communications Yu (representing Minister Peng) and Japanese Minister of Communications Mochizuki exchanged congratulatory messages (the Japanese side spoke first).</p>
<p>The Minister of Communications' congratulatory message stated, "Minister of Communications and gentlemen, today we are celebrating the opening of wireless telephone communication with Japan, which is truly gratifying. China and Japan share the same race and culture and have always been very friendly. Political, economic, and commercial relations have been extremely close. Today, with the development of transportation, exchanges between each other are becoming more frequent. In the past, direct wireless telegraph service has already been opened between the two countries. Now, the opening of wireless telephone communication has a profound significance for the closer relationship between the two countries. I am very pleased to be able to speak directly with the Minister and gentlemen through this new instrument and personally exchange greetings. I hope that China and Japan will utilize the wireless telephone to the fullest extent and enhance the well-being and friendship of the people of both countries."</p>
<p>The Chinese Minister of Communications sent a congratulatory message to the Japanese Minister of Communications, saying, "The China-Japan wireless telephone communication has opened as scheduled today. From now on, the relationship between the people of China and Japan will become closer due to this connection, and the diplomatic relations between China and Japan will become more friendly, promoting the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation to achieve the goal of coexistence and co-prosperity.

<p>And in the two countries' national aspect,</p>
<p>After the Qin phase, it promises to reach a mutual understanding. This important contribution is extremely gratifying to me. I would like to sincerely extend my congratulations to you and all of you.</p>
<p>Director Gao and Others Talk</p>
<p>After the Japanese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs and Japanese Acting Ambassador to China Yosuke Sugimura spoke in Japanese, Director Gao of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs spoke with the Chinese Acting Ambassador to Japan.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu and Others' Congratulatory Messages</p>
<p>Shanghai Mayor Wu and the Mayor of Tokyo exchanged congratulatory messages.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu's congratulatory message stated, "To His Excellency, Mr. Ushizuka, Mayor of Tokyo, on this fifteenth day of February, the 25th year of the Republic of China, Wu Tiecheng, Mayor of Shanghai, respectfully offers this congratulatory message, expressing his sincere congratulations, which states, 'China and Japan are like reeds that can sail the seas, and wireless communication connects us across thousands of miles, as if we were in the same hall. Being kind to our relatives and good to our neighbors is the way to greatness, spreading culture and ushering in auspiciousness. With diplomacy and goodwill, we can harmonize the people and promote mutual commerce and industry. Let us reach all corners of the world and work together in all directions.' I also wish Your Excellency good health and the city of Tokyo prosperity." The Mayor of Tokyo's congratulatory message stated, "Thanks to the efforts of the transportation authorities of Japan and China, international wireless telephone communication was able to begin today. From ten thousand miles away, Torataro Ushizuka, Mayor of Tokyo, is honored to offer his congratulatory message to His Excellency Wu Tiecheng, Mayor of Shanghai. In recent times, telecommunications have been developing at a rapid pace, shortening the distance between countries around the world, which is truly an astonishing fact that is beneficial to national friendship. Therefore, I am confident that the opening of this telephone service will further enhance the good neighborly relations between Japan and China. The people of our two countries, who share the same race and culture, should cooperate closely and for a long time, so that we can contribute to world peace and human welfare. I especially pray for this. I hereby represent the citizens of Tokyo in offering my sincere congratulations and wish Your Excellency good health and the citizens of your city increasing prosperity."</p>

<p>Yu Zuoting's congratulatory message stated, "I had the honor of visiting your country last year and meeting with your esteemed association, which I greatly appreciate. After returning from my travels, I found that your country's commerce is meticulously organized and strictly ordered, which can serve as a model for our country's industry and commerce. Unfortunately, there have been few opportunities for contact in the past, so I have not been able to fully observe and learn. After the wireless telephone connection is established, the interaction between the two sides will become closer. In the future, I hope that your esteemed president will provide guidance on commercial and revolutionary matters to correct our shortcomings. China and Japan have extremely close cultural ties and a long history of trade. Wireless telephones are the latest means of transportation. With this equipment, trade between the two sides will surely develop further. Today, I represent the Shanghai business community in congratulating on the progress of commerce."</p>
<p>Sukenosuke Go, Chairman of the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry, congratulated, "Today is the ceremony for the international wireless telephone between Japan and China, which is extremely gratifying. The utility of this civilized instrument is not limited to the telecommunications organs of Japan and China, but also promotes the friendship and economic relations between the two countries, achieving greater effects. I hereby represent the Japanese commercial and industrial circles in expressing my deep congratulations to the commercial and industrial circles of the Republic of China.

<p>Xiao Tongzi's Congratulatory Message</p>
<p>Xiao Tongzi, President of the Central News Agency, and Tokichi Tanaka, President of the Domei News Agency of Japan, exchanged congratulatory messages. President Xiao's congratulatory message stated, "Mr. Tanaka, today is the first opportunity to communicate via China-Japan wireless telephone, and I feel extremely honored and pleased to speak with you. Wireless telephone communication between China and Japan is necessary for both our countries and has been long-awaited by both sides. Now that it has been achieved, my heart is filled with infinite joy and hope. I would like to take this opportunity to express a few personal thoughts. Based on the rapid advancements in science in recent centuries, humanity's entire life has benefited greatly. In particular, the progress of transportation has gradually clarified the racial and national barriers and misunderstandings caused by past history and inheritance, which is a very gratifying phenomenon. We know that upholding justice and establishing a solid foundation for human peace are the inherent responsibilities of those engaged in the news industry. Especially at a time when the world is full of turmoil and unrest, how can those engaged in the news industry rely on the progress of science to make our work of seeking mutual understanding and assistance among mankind and marching towards the path of peace and happiness have a very high-speed effect? It is something that we cannot forget every moment. This time, the start of China-Japan wireless telephone communication has provided great scientific strength for colleagues in both countries, greatly reducing the distance of time and space. It is very meaningful and worth celebrating to consider the future of Sino-Japanese relations. I hope that colleagues in both countries will use this convenient tool to make efforts to re-establish harmonious relations between the two major nations and then work together to create the dawn of world peace. Because of time constraints, I cannot discuss this with you in detail, which is very regrettable. In conclusion, I wish you and your colleagues in your country good health and enjoyable work."</p>
<p>Congratulatory Messages from Director Wen and Others</p>
<p>Wen Yuqing, Director of the Department of Electrical Administration of the Ministry of Communications, and Susumu Jinto, Director of the Telecommunications Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Communications, communicated (in English).</p>
<p>Director Wen's congratulatory message stated, "Today is the official start of the Tokyo-Shanghai wireless telephone. In the name of the Director of the Department of Electrical Administration of the Ministry of Communications of the Republic of China, I congratulate you on your success and thank you for your sincere cooperation. I deeply believe that the opening of Sino-Japanese wireless telephone communication will not only enhance the international relations between Japan and China, but also gradually bring the people of both countries closer together through the frequent use of wireless telephones, leading to a more complete understanding and impression. I believe that Your Excellency also shares this sentiment. In conclusion, on behalf of my colleagues in the Department of Electrical Administration of our country, I remotely wish the Sino-Japanese wireless telephone business a bright future, and the future of your country's commerce will also be further expanded by this wireless circuit. I wish you all the best."</p>
<p>Director Jinto of the Japanese Telecommunications Bureau congratulated Director Wen, "Due to the enthusiastic cooperation of Your Excellency and the relevant personnel of your Ministry and our Ministry, the Sino-Japanese wireless telephone communication business has been officially completed with satisfactory results, which is extremely gratifying.

The banquet ended at approximately 2:00 PM.</p>
<p>Wu and Mitsuoka Talked on the Phone</p>
<p>After the formal communication ceremony for the China-Japan wireless telephone was held at 10:00 AM yesterday, Mayor Wu also spoke with Seiro Mitsuoka, Director of the Japanese Telegraph and Communication Agency, at 3:00 PM, and the two sides exchanged greetings.</p>
<p>Mr. Qian Xin-Zhi's Phone Call</p>
<p>Yesterday was the first day of official wireless telephone communication between China and Japan. Tokyo frequently called this port. At about 4:00 PM in the afternoon, Mr. Ota, the Economic Department Director of the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, called Mr. Qian Xin-Zhi, the collaborator of the Four Lines Savings Association in this port. The voice quality of the answers was very clear. First, Ota asked Qian what his thoughts were on the start of China-Japan wireless telephone communication. Qian replied that from now on, traffic between the two countries would be more convenient, news would be spread more quickly, and news agencies would be able to obtain more accurate information. If there were any untrue rumors from afar, they could be quickly corrected. If there was anything that hindered diplomatic relations between the two countries, it could be corrected as soon as possible. For example, today's Shanghai Daily News carried the news that a large amount of Japanese rayon was secretly imported from North China without paying tariffs. If this news were conveyed to your country via wireless telephone, your country could carry out an inspection and take action to crack down on it, so that legitimate merchants in both countries would not be affected.</p>
<p>Page 15</p>
<p>Ota also asked if there was a possibility of currency inflation regarding opinions on China's new monetary system policy. Qian replied that China's new monetary system policy had been very successful since its implementation. There are three functions of this monetary system policy: First, China's banknote issuance can be unified from now on; second, reserves are centralized, and the monetary system's foundation is more solid; and third, silver is preserved so that it is not scattered. In terms of its nature, it is not abandoning the silver standard system. In terms of its measures, there is absolutely no intention of currency inflation. Please do not misunderstand the news media. Ota also asked what the content of China's recent issuance of new public bonds was. Qian replied that 146 million yuan of Unified Public Bonds and 34 million yuan of Restoration Public Bonds were issued. After the previously issued bonds were exchanged, there will only be these two types of public bonds in circulation on the market in the future. Ota also asked if Chinese banks were willing to purchase these public bonds. Qian replied that the bonds issued by the Chinese government have solid funds, and the people have great confidence in them, and banks are naturally more willing to accept them.</p>
<p>Busy Civilian Phone Calls</p>
<p>The China-Japan wireless telephone officially opened for business yesterday at noon and extended to 6:00 PM. Phone calls between the two sides were very busy. From 12:00 PM to 4:00 PM, a total of fifty or ten phone calls were made between the two places, but most of them were inquiries. Phone calls of a formal business nature have yet to come another day. Also, the first phone call between private individuals in China and Japan was a ten-word call between the President of the Shanghai News of the Shanghai News and Communications Industry, Boqi, and the President of the Northeast Japanese Telegraph and Communication Agency, Seiro Mitsuoka.</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce Sends a Letter to the Public Works Department</p>
<p>Opposing Telephone Charges Per Call</p>
<p>Please Prepare Sound Relief Measures in Advance</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Board of Directors of the Public Concession Engineering Bureau yesterday, stating: "We are writing to inform you that on the 13th of this month, we received a letter from the Municipal First Special District Citizens' Federation stating that the Shanghai Telephone Company, in order to satisfy its own selfish desires, has formulated new charging regulations, which will be implemented starting on March 1st. In this autumn of economic depression and industrial and commercial stagnation, how can we bear additional burdens? All of our Shanghai groups should do everything in our power to seek a thorough struggle to alleviate the citizens' unwarranted burdens. Your association is a Shanghai merchant group, so you should actively seek benefits for all members, gradually eliminate the economic panic, and restore the prosperity of a few years ago. Moreover, the use of telephones is a tool to increase commercial traffic. Once restricted by the resolution charging fee, it is an invisible constraint, and the intangible damage to various industries will be incalculable. Our association is heartbroken and cannot remain silent. This special article is offered to you, and we hope that you will immediately inform all members to solicit opinions and make strong representations, which is our hope." The Shanghai Telephone Company intends to change the user's call fee to be calculated by the resolution. When the chairman of our association attended the Public Utilities Committee of the Engineering Bureau on April 1st of last year, he represented the business community of this city and clearly expressed his opposition to the implementation of this new method. It is now heard that the charging method set by the company will be implemented on the first day of next month. Once this matter is realized, the burden of telephone charges on general stores will inevitably increase by dozens or hundreds of times compared to the past, so that the company can obtain a profit of more than one point. In the aftermath of the market's decline, there should never be such unreasonable behavior. It has been decided by the 78th Standing Committee of the Association to write to the Engineering Bureau Medical Council and the 18th Standing Committee to write to the Board of Directors of the Engineering Bureau. Taking into account the actual situation of industry and commerce in this city, we have properly planned relief measures on record. Correspondingly, the file is offered, and we hope that your association will take into account the economic situation of all merchants in the city and prepare proper relief measures in advance to maintain commerce, which is our hope."</p>

<p>Fishmongers Punished for Fish Scale Fraud; Investigation by the Health Department Reveals Scales were Tampered With; Fined Twenty Dollars Each</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the new system of weights and measures, a considerable period of time has passed. While many merchants comply, there are still many who feign compliance. The authorities of the Public Concession have assisted greatly in the promotion of this new system. The Health Department has specially dispatched inspectors to inspect vegetable markets in various districts from time to time to check whether all vegetable stalls are using the new scales and whether the weights and measures are legal. As a result, violations are often discovered. However, the tricks used by general vegetable vendors to cheat are endless, so there are inevitably cases where one is protected while another is neglected. For example, the fish stalls in various vegetable markets, in addition to secretly using private scales, also add iron wire around the fish nets used when weighing fish for customers, in order to increase the weight of the net. Fish vendors usually have two nets for holding fish, one with rattan around it and the other with iron wire. The rattan is painted black to make it indistinguishable. Because rattan is lighter than iron, the iron-rimmed net is used to weigh the fish, and the rattan-rimmed net is used when filling the bag. Thus, the weight of the fish is increased invisibly. This fraudulent method is not easy for customers to detect. It has also been confirmed by the investigators that this is the case with fish vendors in more than one vegetable market, and many are committing the offense. The Health Department believes that it is necessary to ban this practice in accordance with the law to prevent bad influences. Therefore, the Health Department has reported the stall locations and vendor licenses of the fish vendors who have been found to be cheating, Zhu Wenda, Wu Lindi, Yu Genlin, Ji Xiaomao, Zhu Changjiang, Chen Shuizhen, Wei Rongsheng, Zhu Dingfu, Li Shunfa, Zhu Agui, Wang Gaolin, etc., to the Legal Department of the Public Concession, requesting the First Special District Court to file charges of fraud. Yesterday morning, Judges Zhan and Dai separately opened the Second and Fifth Courts for preliminary hearings. Chiang Pao-chien and Chien K'un-chiu, lawyers representing the Public Concession, presented the case. Two inspectors from the Health Department, Bai Luomu, testified to the investigation of the cheating, and presented two fish nets of the same shape to the court for inspection. The vendors, during preliminary hearings, mostly claimed that the iron-rimmed nets were only used for customers who brought their own scales, etc. As a result, Zhu Agui and Wu Lindi were granted a postponement for further hearing, while the others were fined twenty yuan each as a warning.</p>

<p>Letter Received</p>
<p>To the Editor: Today's local news in your newspaper reported a case of impersonating a military officer. It stated that the main suspect, Wang Dongyu, was a native of Shangrao. After investigation by this association, Wang Dongyu is definitely not a native of Shangrao. Although Zhang Xueli is a native of Jiafang, he studied at Hangzhou High School in Zhejiang Province. After graduating, there was no way out, and he stayed in Hangzhou. Wang Dongyu lured him to Shanghai, paid money to buy a title, thinking to develop, but unexpectedly was implicated. Buying an official led to disaster. The youth was ignorant, which is very pitiful. This letter is to your newspaper, hoping for a correction to avoid misleading the public. Thank you very much. Sincerely, The Shangrao Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai. February 15.</p>

<p>Telegraphic Communications and the Telegraphic Industry under the Guidance of the Ministry of Transportation. By Zhen.</p>
<p>The Tianjin Dagongbao newspaper, in an article on January 10th titled "Central Government Affairs Should Be Rectified Overall," stated: "China's political function is extremely incomplete, and policy actions often take contradictory forms. Most institutions only know their own interests and do not seek the accomplishments of the whole. They only have a partial perspective and do not make comprehensive plans. For example, transportation agencies only know to increase freight rates, but they do not understand that the outlets for agricultural and industrial production are blocked, and the result is that they obstruct transportation revenue." The words are earnest and hit the current ills. Now the unification and consolidation of the central government is stronger than in any period since the Republic of China. It will certainly adjust all past contradictory phenomena. Public opinion can guide politics, and what the newspaper discusses is what the people want to say.</p>
<p>Telegraph administration is part of the central administration. Except where otherwise provided in the telegraph regulations, it should be handled by the central authorities. There is no doubt about this. However, the establishment of long-distance telephone lines by various provincial governments and the communication via shortwave radio stations by non-military agencies not only violates central laws and regulations but also goes against economic principles. On this point, this publication has always advocated that it should be centrally controlled. In the previous issue, Hao Jun's article "The Problem of Overall Telegraph Administration" has already clearly explained this, and it is truly a representative work of this publication. Now, fortunately, Mr. Jiang Tingfu, the director of the Executive Yuan's Political Affairs Department, has already paid attention to this, and we hope that he will satisfy our expectations.</p>
<p>As for the passage in the article stating that transportation agencies only know to increase freight rates, and that the result is that they obstruct transportation revenue, it is truly an irrefutable argument. However, the transportation agencies referred to seem to be transportation agencies, not communication agencies, and telegraph administration is naturally not included. Speaking frankly about telegraph administration, we feel that in the past two years, the telegraphic industry run by the Ministry of Transportation has always focused on the public. Even when the telegraphic administration economy was extremely difficult, it still innovated various methods to reduce rates and facilitate the public. Just taking the item of calculating the names and addresses of recipients as three characters for billing purposes, it loses more than 400,000 yuan per year. In the past two years, it has lost almost 800,000 yuan. Those with short-sighted vision, although expressing sympathy for this policy, dare not implement it for fear of reduced income and lack of follow-up measures. However, the authorities resolutely decided to implement it starting from January 1, 1934. This is not because the transportation authorities are ignorant of the principle of balancing income and expenditure, but rather because state-owned enterprises should take reducing the burden on the public and facilitating public communication as the principle, and then there can be development.</p>
<p>Since the various telegraph and telephone rate reduction measures have been implemented successively since January 1934, it has been more than two years. Has the telegraphic service grown or deteriorated in these two years? Numbers are urgently needed to prove this. If it has grown, then the rate reduction measures have been successful; if it has failed. If it is successful, then we can understand the direction that state-owned enterprises should take; if it fails, then we can see the decline of national economic power. There is much room for research between the two. The following is a diagram showing the approximate numbers of outgoing domestic telegram characters from 1928 to 1934:</p>
<p>Comparative Diagram of the Number of Characters of Outgoing Domestic Telegrams from 1928 to 1934</p>
<p>Judging from the above diagram, it can be seen that although the number of characters of outgoing domestic telegrams in 1934 was less than in 1932, the decided number was greater, and both have an upward trend. From this, it can be seen that the public using telegrams in 1934 was more interested than before, and the telegraph service was also more developed than before. It seems that the current telegraphic administration policy implemented by the Ministry of Transportation has achieved considerable success. It is hoped that the central government will adjust the national telegraphic administration, unify command, and achieve maximum efficiency with the least amount of economic investment. The future of central government affairs may have benefits.</p>
<h3>From Sino-Japanese Telegraph Cooperation to Sino-Japanese Cooperation By Song.</h3>
<p>China and Japan are of the same script and ethnicity, from the same continent and ocean, and have common characteristics in their metaphysical transformations and close geographical relations. Strict cooperation between them should be a matter of course. However, in recent years, with the frequency of exchanges between the two countries, there have been many disputes. This situation is actually a common occurrence in international relations. If we can promote mutual prosperity with a spirit of equality and mutual assistance and an attitude of fairness and peace, and with understanding, there is no reason why we cannot cooperate.</p>
<p>To take a minor example, the telegraphic industry can illustrate the general situation. Sino-Japanese commerce is inherently frequent, and telegrams to and from China account for half of my country's international telegrams. In the past, they were transmitted through submarine cables, which were vulnerable to interference and could not achieve maximum efficiency. Since the opening of the Sino-Japanese wireless telegraph circuits in June of the year before last, Sino-Japanese telegrams have suddenly become developed. According to statistics for 1935, the number of characters of telegrams transmitted to and from China and Japan via Sino-Japanese wireless circuits exceeded those transmitted by foreign submarine cables. This shows that cooperation between the two sides benefits both parties. I think this is convenient.</p>
<p>In order to develop the telegraphic industry in both countries, the Sino-Japanese telegraphic authorities opened Sino-Japanese wireless telephone services yesterday (the 15th). The situation of the joint venture has been recorded in another article and will not be repeated here. It is heard that the speech is clear, as if one were talking face to face. From now on, in addition to using telegrams to communicate information, Sino-Japanese people can also use the telephone to speak in the same room. Not only will the telegraphic industry of China and Japan be developed, but also the international relations between the two countries will become closer.</p>
<p>Interstate relations should be based on good faith, and the foundation of good faith lies in the practice of "sincerity." As the saying goes, "those who are not deceitful are not trustworthy," and "sincerity leads to success." The Sino-Japanese telegraphic authorities meet each other with "sincerity" first, eliminating the psychology of "insincerity," so Sino-Japanese communication can be established. In other words, Sino-Japanese communication is the result of the effect of "sincerity." Moreover, the equipment and timing of international communication must be extremely accurate and sensitive in order to respond fluently. Accuracy and sensitivity are the essence of the word "righteousness." If one cannot achieve the goal of "righteousness," how can one expect to be truly "trustworthy"?</p>
<p>The opening of Sino-Japanese wireless telephones lies in the "sincere" mentality and the "righteous" attitude, and then there is the manifestation of "trust." If we discuss all issues based on this spirit, then the theory of coexistence and co-prosperity can be seen in reality. Should not the people of China and Japan strive for this?</p>
<h3>Formal Sino-Japanese Wireless Telephone Communication By Lin.</h3>
<p>Sino-Japanese wireless telephones have been actively prepared by the Ministry of Transportation of our country and the Ministry of Communications of Japan for several months. Since the 15th of this month, communication between Shanghai and Tokyo has been officially opened, with very clear sound waves, as if one were talking face to face in the same room. The calling and communication procedures are considered rapid. Those who communicated on that day were all satisfied.</p>
<p>Wireless telephones are a recently invented communication tool. Like wireless telegraphs and landline telegraphs and telephones, they are the main veins of modern telecommunications, each with its own unique effect. Landline telephones are originally beneficial for short-distance communication, but for long-distance communication across the ocean, it is more convenient to use wireless telephones. For places with developed commerce in both regions, wireless telephones are most suitable. The advantage of long-distance telephones over telegraphs is that the cost is lower, and because the two parties can discuss and research face-to-face, they can immediately wait for a reply without having to send a return telegram, saving both money and time. Therefore, in recent years, many European and American countries have connected wireless telephones to each other, and the United States uses them most extensively. Because the country is vast and wide, wireless telephones have also been used for domestic communications in various places in recent years.</p>
<p>China and Japan are adjacent countries with very close relations. Our country's foreign trade, whether in terms of imports or exports, is ranked first by Japan. Due to commercial needs, the transmission of information should be as convenient as possible. In the past, Sino-Japanese telecommunications, in addition to passing through the Shanghai-Nagasaki-Qingdao-Sasebo submarine cable, the Shanghai International Radio Station could also communicate with Japan. According to statistics for 1935, a total of 254,469 telegrams were sent to Japan, which shows the busy nature of the telegraph service. Submarine cables often experience obstacles, and the Shanghai Radio Station also often feels the congestion of the circuits. It is clear that the original equipment is not sufficient to achieve sufficient convenience, and it is necessary to increase the convenience of telecommunications. The convenience of telecommunications, on the one hand, helps the development of commerce between the two countries, so as to achieve economic mutual benefit; at the same time, on the other hand, it can also eliminate the barriers between the people of the two countries through telecommunications contact, so as to promote political reconciliation. The transportation authorities of China and Japan have realized this, so they have both made great efforts to seek close cooperation in telecommunications. The communication of Sino-Japanese wireless telephones is the result of this effort.</p>
<p>According to the International Telecommunications Bureau, the types of international wireless telephone calls between Shanghai and Tokyo, call charges, and communication procedures are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Types of calls (A) Person-to-person call (must first state your name and telephone number, and specify the telephone number to be called and the person to talk to), (B) Station-to-station call (refers to a call in which the name of the called or calling person is not specified during the call, but only a certain telephone number is specified), (C) Messenger call (talking to someone in a certain place, but the other party does not have a telephone, and the telephone bureau must send someone to notify them.)</p>
<p>(2) The initial three-minute call charge is 15 yuan in legal tender. Calls of less than three minutes are also charged for three minutes. After that, for each additional minute or less than one minute, an additional 5 yuan in legal tender will be added. (The above three types of calls are all at the same price)</p>
<p>(3) Procedures If you want to make a call from the Chinese area of this city, first connect to number 40. If you want to make a call from the Public Concession, first connect to number 03, and then apply for registration. Then state the type of call you want to make. After the international telephone is connected, the telephone bureau will notify you to speak.</p>
<p>(4) Cancellation fee If the other party is unwilling to talk after the international telephone has been connected, or the called party cannot be found, it will be treated as a cancellation, and a cancellation fee of 1.50 yuan in legal tender must be paid.</p>
<p>It is heard that this service is currently limited to Shanghai and Tokyo. In the future, it will be gradually promoted to other places. The future of Sino-Japanese relations and trade will surely make considerable progress. This can be predicted.</p>
<h3>Briefly Discussing the Key Points of the General Rules for International Telephone Business By Qing.</h3>
<p>The Shanghai International Radio Station of the Ministry of Transportation has been preparing for Sino-Japanese, Sino-British, and Sino-Philippine international calls for a long time. Now the preparations for Sino-Japanese calls have been completed, and business will begin yesterday. In order to meet the needs, the Ministry of Transportation has specially issued a set of General Rules for International Telephone Business, which will be implemented on February 15 of this year. International telephone calls are still in their infancy in our country, and everything about the rules of communication is presumably what the people of society urgently want to know. Therefore, I will excerpt the important points in the above-mentioned business rules and describe them in order to provide them for everyone to read:</p>
<p>Types of calls and priorities International calls are divided into three types: government affairs, business, and private affairs: All calls requested by the head of the country, the heads of the various ministries, departments, committees, and offices of the central government, the commander-in-chief of the army, navy, or air force, and the resident diplomats or consuls of the treaty country are considered government affairs calls; all calls completely related to international telephone business between the international telephone authorities are called business calls: all calls that do not belong to government or business are generally called private calls. Government affairs calls have priority over all other types of calls: urgent business calls have priority over private calls: all kinds of international calls have priority over domestic urgent long-distance calls. The nature of international calls can be divided into "station-to-station," "person-to-person," and "messenger." Three categories: "Station-to-station calls" only need to state the telephone numbers of the calling party and the called party: "Person-to-person calls" must specify the telephone number, the name of the calling party and the called party, and other specific matters; "Messenger calls" are applicable to called parties who have not installed a telephone. In addition, international calls that have been scheduled in advance by the calling party within the prescribed business hours and have been registered in advance are called timed calls. If business and circuit conditions permit, such calls should be connected at approximately the scheduled call time.</p>
<p>Registration procedures Anyone who wants to make a "station-to-station call" should first call their telephone exchange. At the request of the exchange, the following items must be informed: (1) the name of the place where the called party is located; (2) the telephone number of the called party. If the telephone number is unknown, inform the name and address of the called party; (3) the telephone number of the calling party; (4) the scheduled call time and other specific items. Anyone who wants to make a "person-to-person call" or "messenger call," in addition to following the four regulations of the above-mentioned "station-to-station call," must also inform: 1. All notices sufficient to determine the calling party and the called party (such as the names of both parties, the names of the service institutions or groups where they are located, the names of a certain part of the institution where they are located, the telephone number of the extension, and the language used for communication, etc.); 2. If it is a government affairs call, the calling party must state that what they are requesting is a government affairs call and report their official title. Those who have not installed a telephone can go to the telephone exchange to fill out a form to make a call.</p>
<p>Preparation for the call After the calling bureau receives any of the following reports from the called bureau, it will immediately notify the calling party to prepare to answer the call or cancel the call: (1) The called party can be reached; (2) The called party cannot accept the call because they are unwilling to talk, cannot be reached, or for other reasons; (3) In the case of a messenger call, the called bureau has tried to notify the called party to come to the bureau to answer the call. If the calling party is preparing to make a call or is making a call, and the telephone or line is damaged or for other similar reasons, the common call may be completed by another telephone.</p>
<p>Regulations for charging International call rates are stipulated by the Ministry of Transportation. All call charges payable by the calling party shall be paid in Chinese national currency. The prices are the same regardless of government or private affairs, and regardless of "person-to-person," "station-to-station," or "messenger." Each call fee is calculated for at least three minutes. For each additional minute of billing time beyond three minutes, one-third of the three-minute call fee will be added. The time of the last call of less than one minute is also calculated as one minute. The billing time for "station-to-station calls" is calculated from the time when both telephones are connected and both users can start talking. The billing time for "person-to-person calls" is calculated from the time when both telephones are connected and the designated caller can start talking. When a calling party who has not installed a telephone requests a call, they should first pay the initial three-minute call fee. After the call is completed, the total call fee will be calculated and the difference will be paid immediately. The billing call time can be extended to twelve minutes. If no one else is waiting to make a call, it can be extended to more than twelve minutes. However, when the telephone service is busy, the telephone bureau may limit the call time to less than twelve minutes. The calling party may also request the operator in advance to interrupt the conversation between the two parties and notify them of the elapsed billing time.</p>
<p>Restrictions on Cancellation The calling party may request cancellation at any time before the call starts. However, if a request for cancellation is made after receiving one of the reports specified in the above item, a cancellation fee shall be paid. If any of the following situations occur after the procedure for connecting the circuit is completed, this call will also be treated as a cancellation, and a cancellation fee will be charged: (1) There is no reply from the called party or the called party cannot be notified; (2) The called party cannot be reached or is unwilling to answer the call; (3) The called party is reached, but the calling party does not reply; (4) The called party is reached, but the calling party cannot be reached or is unwilling to answer the call. However, if the above four situations are caused by damage to the telephone or line, no cancellation fee will be charged. In addition to scheduled calls, if the calling party does not receive any report within two hours from the time of registration; or the operator (A) receives a report that both the calling and called parties can communicate, or (B) cannot connect the call within one hour from the specified call time, the cancellation will not be charged a cancellation fee. However, if the report arrives within two hours, but the operator is unable to notify the calling party because the calling party does not respond or the response is delayed (except for those caused by machine line failure), the calling party cannot use the reason that they have not received the report to avoid paying the cancellation fee.</p>
<h3>The Telegraph Engineering of the Past Year By Our Reporter</h3>
<p>The telegraph engineering undertaken by the Ministry of Transportation in 1935 has achieved significant results. The major aspects are summarized below:</p>
<p>(A) Landline Telegraphs</p>
<p>1.  Construction of Lines</p>
<p>Landline telegraphs rely on circuits as their main equipment. The telegraph lines in our country stretch for more than 100,000 kilometers, most of which have not been repaired for many years. In addition, military campaigns have been frequent in recent years, causing more damage. Therefore, repairing the circuits has become an important task in our country's telecommunications administration. In 1935, repairs were made to damaged or poorly communicating existing lines, of which 7,051 kilometers have been completed and 2,709 kilometers have not been completed. For newly established bureaus or in order to allow direct communication between the two bureaus, 4,083 kilometers of new circuits were laid, and 179 kilometers have not been completed. In order to increase the number of business operations, the original number of circuits was insufficient, so 2,935 kilometers of additional circuits were added, and 490 kilometers have not been completed.</p>
<p>2.  Installation of Machines</p>
<p>A. Stations equipped with Creed automatic machines:</p>
<p>Nanjing-Hankou line, Shanghai-Beiping line, Beiping-Tianjin line, Beiping-Hankou line, Tianjin-Yantai line, Yantai-Dalian line.</p>
<p>B. Stations equipped with Wheatstone machines:</p>
<p>Ba County-Chengdu line, Ba County-Guiyang line, Chengdu-Ya'an line, Changsha-Guiyang line, Changsha-Hongjiang line, Hongjiang-Guiyang line, Changsha-Changde line, Hankou-Guangzhou line, Shanghai-Yinxian line, Chengdu-Emei line, Changsha-Yuanling line, Hankou-Yichang line, Shanghai has a wireless telegraph room.</p>
<p>C. Stations equipped with storage batteries: Stations equipped with Creed machines must be equipped with storage batteries. In 1935, the Tianjin and Hankou bureaus were both completed.</p>
<p>(B) Wireless Telegraphs and Telephones</p>
<p>1.  Domestic Radio Stations</p>
<p>Domestic radio stations can be divided into two categories: frontier and inland. These two categories are further divided into establishment of stations and expansion. The radio stations established in 1935 in the frontier areas are: five stations in Chahar Province, two stations in Suiyuan, and five stations in Gansu and Ningxia. In the inland areas, there are four stations in Shaanxi: Yulin, Shangxian, Zhengwu, and Luochuan; three stations in Fujian: Jinmen, Longyan, and Nanping; and one station in Sichuan: Mianyang.</p>
<p>Regarding expansion: Fuzhou, Ba County, Changsha, Guiyang, Zheng County, Chang'an and other stations have each added a 500-watt machine, Guangzhou has added a 2,000-watt machine, Tianjin has a 500-watt machine, and Chengdu has one 250-watt machine and one 500-watt machine.</p>
<p>2.  International Radio Stations</p>
<p>The expansion and maintenance of international radio station telegraph engineering has been detailed in this publication, Issue 52, "International Radio Stations in 1935," and will not be repeated here. However, the domestic and international wireless telephone projects were all handled by the station, and are briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>A. Domestic Wireless Telephone The Ministry of Transportation previously ordered three 3.5-kilowatt dual-use telephone and telegraph machines from British Standard Company for the purpose of installing domestic wireless radio stations. The equipment was installed in Shanghai, Hankou, and Guangzhou. The Shanghai machine is still located in the Zhenru Liuhang International Station. The Hankou machine purchased land in Luojiadun as a transmitting station, and the old Wuchang long-wave station site was used as a receiving station. The houses and iron towers have been completed and the machine will be installed soon. The Guangdong machine was commissioned by the Ministry to be handled by the Guangzhou Automatic Telephone Committee. The transmitting station is located in Dongshibei Township, Guangzhou, and the receiving station is located in Hebian Village, and is actively preparing.</p>
<p>B. International Wireless Telephone The Ministry of Transportation previously purchased telephone equipment when ordering the Sino-British Radio Station from Marconi Company for international communication. The required terminal and security equipment has been purchased from the British Standard Company and installed properly. It is also planned to add amplitude modulation equipment to the US machine to make the telephone suitable for selecting the appropriate cycle and communicating with San Francisco. Communication between Shanghai and Tokyo was opened yesterday.</p>
<p>(C) Local Telephone</p>
<p>1.  Establishment of new local telephones</p>
<p>2.  Expansion of local telephones</p>
<p>The capital—the main bureau's machine numbers have long been full, and the North Branch Bureau has also successively reported this due to the demand in residential areas. The Ministry of Transportation plans to expand the North Branch Bureau by 500 automatic machines and add a South Branch Bureau with 1,800 machines. In 1935, the expansion work of the North Branch Bureau was completed together with the external line project. The work of the South Branch Bureau is also half completed.</p>
<p>Qingdao—The main bureau will expand by 1,200 automatic machines and add a Lichun Branch Bureau with 50 magneto machines.</p>
<p>Shanghai—Add a 300-machine automatic branch bureau in the city center area and a 50-machine magneto branch bureau in Minhang Town.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang—Reinstall 1,600 common battery machines.</p>
<p>Wuxian—Add a 150-machine magneto branch bureau in Sushuguan.</p>
<p>(D) Long-distance Telephone</p>
<p>1.  Construction of lines in various provinces</p>
<p>2.  Construction of lines in nine provinces</p>
<p>Jingjin Line—This line is divided into three sections, namely Nanjing to Tongshan, Tongshan to Jinan, and Jinan to Tianjin. The Tianjin-Jinan section of the project was completed in May 1935, and the Tongjing section was completed in September.</p>
<p>Jinghan Section—Seven-tenths has been completed.</p>
<p>Jiqing Section—The original telephone and telegraph lines along the Jiaoji Railway are now completely merged and rebuilt, and a pair of telephone lines has been added, which was completed in December 1935.</p>
<p>HanChang Section—One-third has been completed in 1935</p>
<p>Xuzheng Section—Preparation for starting work is underway.</p>
<h3>Let's Talk About Free Telegram Inquiries Again By Qinghua</h3>
<p>...Please pay special attention to all banks and businesses...</p>
<p>I have already discussed in detail in this publication the method of free inquiries with the telegraph office when there are suspected errors in the telegrams received, but few people have paid attention to it. Therefore, recently, people still inevitably blame the telegraph office for errors in telegrams without knowing how to use the free inquiry method, or ask for a refund of their telegraphic inquiry fee after the fact. This kind of thing, on the part of the recipient, is not only easy to delay important matters, but also wastes money. Therefore, I am not afraid of wordiness and will talk about it in detail again, hoping that commercial firms and private individuals who often send and receive telegrams will pay special attention!</p>
<p>According to the regulations of the telegraph office in the past, if the recipient suspected any errors or omissions in the incoming telegram, they could hold the original telegram and ask the telegraph office to send a fee-paying public telegram to inquire. If one character was inquired, the telegram fee for one character had to be paid in advance. If the inquiry revealed that it was the telegraph office's error, it would of course be refunded in full. If there was no error, the prepaid fee could not be refunded. In theory, this was not harsh. Starting last year, in order to develop the telegraph service, the Ministry of Transportation changed all such fee-paying public telegrams, whether domestic or international, to free, so that recipients would reduce the trouble of prepaying telegram fees. When there is a question about an incoming telegram, you only need to make a phone call to the telegraph office, stating the number of the incoming telegram and the character to be inquired, and you can get a reply telegram in a moment, proving that the character being inquired is wrong. Is it not a pity if the recipient does not know about or use this preferential method?</p>
<p>Recently, I have seen several banks and businesses that often send and receive telegrams, because the telegrams they received were suspected of having errors, so they sent another telegram to the sender to inquire. After the sender received the inquiry telegram, they sent another telegram back to reply. This back and forth not only costs two telegram fees, but also takes longer to receive a reply than sending an inquiry telegram from the telegraph office. Let me give an example below to illustrate:</p>
<p>Suppose the recipient inquires with the telegraph office due to a suspected error in the telegram. The telegraph office immediately sends a short public telegram in foreign language to the sending telegraph office to inquire. After the sending telegraph office receives the public telegram, it retrieves the original telegram for verification and immediately sends back a public telegram, reporting that the character being inquired is wrong. After the telegraph office receives the reply telegram, it immediately notifies the recipient. The time spent on such an inquiry is only the time it takes for public telegrams to be transmitted back and forth between the two telegraph offices. If the recipient sends an inquiry telegram, then the number of characters in the telegram is greater, and you must also add the registration or name and address, and then go through a code translation procedure, which of course takes more time. However, when it is transmitted to the other telegraph office, the telegraph office must also transcribe the telegram manuscript, translate it into text, deliver it to the original sender, and send back a reply telegram after verifying it with the original telegram. When sending back the telegram, it will take more time for transmission, translation, delivery, and other procedures before it can reach the original recipient. This kind of inquiry is of course slower than the telegraph office's direct inquiry by public telegram. Therefore, this key point must be understood by all telegraph personnel in banks or businesses!</p>
<p>There is also a disadvantage to sending an inquiry telegram yourself, that is, the telegraph office cannot refund the fees for the two telegrams back and forth according to the regulations. This is because the telegraph office already has a preferential method of free inquiries. If the sender and recipient do not know how to use it and send telegrams themselves, it is of course inconvenient to refund the fees. However, in order to make the telegraph office's service thorough, the Ministry of Transportation has issued a notice to all telegraph offices that if a recipient does not know the free inquiry method and sends an inquiry telegram themselves, as long as the inquiry telegram is in plain language, the telegraph office's telegraph receiving staff should tell him about the free inquiry method and ask him not to send the telegram himself, but to have the telegraph office send the inquiry telegram on his behalf. However, if a bank or business sends a coded telegram to inquire, the telegraph office's telegraph receiving staff will not be able to know, and this is what I want to ask all banks and businesses to pay special attention to.</p>
<h3>International Telecommunications News By Feng</h3>
<p>England</p>
<p>Further Reduction in Telephone Charges</p>
<p>According to Postmaster General Tryon's report in the House of Commons, since telephone charges were repeatedly reduced starting in October of the year before last, the results have been quite good. Daytime calls have increased by 12% each week, totaling 365,000 calls. Nighttime calls increased by 180%, totaling 180,000 calls. In the past twelve months, 200,000 new households have been installed, a twofold increase over the previous year. He proposed reducing the rental fee for ordinary extension telephones from 16 shillings to 14 shillings per year, and creating low-cost private extension exchanges and certain small exchanges. These new rates are expected to be implemented in January 1936. He hopes that the three-minute call fee of 2 shillings and 6 pence can be used to communicate with any location in the country this spring.</p>
<p>Italy</p>
<p>Expanding the Rural Telephone Network</p>
<p>In order to expand the domestic rural telephone network, the Italian government has specially approved an additional appropriation of 20 million Italian lire from the national treasury every six months for four accounting years starting from 1935-36, in order to provide assistance.</p>
<p>South Africa</p>
<p>Creation of Social Telegrams</p>
<p>The Minister of Posts and Telecommunications of the Union of South Africa has created a type of social telegram for marriages and birthdays, which has been implemented since October 1 of last year and is limited to South Africa and Southwest Africa. The price is 9 pence for every 12 characters or less, and 1 penny will be added for each additional character. In addition, there is a "good news" telegram envelope that costs 1 penny, which is gold and green and quite beautiful. It will also be implemented in December.</p>

<h3>The U.S. Agricultural Adjustment Act Ruled Unconstitutional and Its Impact By Yunfeng</h3>
<p>The U.S. Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA) and National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) were two major pillars of Roosevelt's so-called New Deal. But NIRA was ruled unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court last May, and AAA has recently suffered the same fate. Needless to say, this is a serious blow to Roosevelt's recovery policy, and thus has a great impact on the U.S. and even the world economy.</p>
<p>During the panic period, not only did industrial products exhibit overproduction, but agricultural products also had the same adverse tendency. The U.S. Roosevelt's Agricultural Adjustment Act was used to limit the production of agricultural products in order to alleviate the agricultural panic. According to this bill, the government established the Agricultural Adjustment Administration to limit the sowing area and production of various agricultural products; farmers who implemented production reduction were given subsidies; at the same time, farmers who received subsidies had to pay agricultural product transformation tax to compensate for part of the government's expenditure. Such an agricultural adjustment law was announced on May 12 last year. After the announcement, the farmers had signed contracts with the Agricultural Adjustment Administration to accept the production restriction law, but they opposed the transformation tax and filed a lawsuit with the court, saying that the government's behavior was unconstitutional. At that time, the government amended the bill and passed it in both houses of Congress. Recently, the Hoosac Cotton Mills refused to pay the transformation tax and business tax based on the Agricultural Adjustment Act (the number totaled more than 81,690 U.S. dollars), and a dispute arose with the government, which was sued to the Supreme Court. On January 6 this year, the Supreme Court ruled that the Agricultural Adjustment Act was unconstitutional. The basis for this ruling mainly has two points: 1. Deciding the business tax is an overreach of the parliament; 2. According to the agricultural product production control of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, it is an encroachment on the authority of the state. If we actually analyze it, the dispute caused by Roosevelt's Agricultural Adjustment Act is a reflection of the conflict of interests between the landlords and entrepreneurs of American capitalism. However, we do not want to base our analysis on this point to analyze the failure of the Agricultural Adjustment Act; now, what should be said next is the impact of the Agricultural Adjustment Act being ruled unconstitutional.</p>
<p>First of all, because the Agricultural Adjustment Act was ruled unconstitutional, the Agricultural Adjustment Bureau established according to this law must be disbanded immediately, and the agricultural product transformation tax and business tax must of course be stopped immediately; on the other hand, the subsidies given to farmers by the government should also seem to stop being paid. In this way, the impact on the government's finances does not seem to be that great. But the actual situation is not like that. Because the Roosevelt government signed production restriction contracts with farmers before the Supreme Court's ruling, they must be fulfilled anyway, so the subsidies given to farmers by the government must continue to be paid. It is estimated that the government will have to spend about 300 million U.S. dollars on farmer subsidies. In this way, on the one hand, the government's financial revenue has reduced the business tax part of agricultural products, and on the other hand, it must continue to pay subsidies. The result will of course have a great impact on the government's finances. After the Agricultural Adjustment Act expired, such a message came from Washington: "President Roosevelt's 1937 budget could not balance income and expenditure before it was submitted to Congress; because after the agricultural product law expired, the president's original estimate of the business tax of 547,000,000 U.S. dollars lost its basis; that is, of the 529,000,000 yuan included in the 1936 budget, only 64,000,000 yuan was received." Therefore, the U.S. Treasury Department recently approved a supplementary budget of 367,700,000 yuan, of which 296,185,000 yuan is used to subsidize farmers across the country. But although this supplementary budget fills the budget gap caused by the expiration of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, the fundamental financial difficulties have not been resolved.</p>
<p>Secondly, the expiration of the Agricultural Adjustment Act has an impact on rural areas. According to the Agricultural Adjustment Act, the production of fifteen agricultural products was restricted. Taking cotton as an example, under the regulations of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, in 1935, the planting area should be reduced by 25% to 35%, and in 1936 (from August of this year to July of next year), it should be reduced by 30% to 45%. Now that the Agricultural Adjustment Act has expired, there is no so-called restriction on cotton production, so its price will inevitably fall. In fact, after the Agricultural Adjustment Act was ruled unconstitutional, not only the U.S., but also the world cotton market has undergone great changes.</p>
<p>Government subsidies occupy a very important position in the income of American rural areas. This can be seen in the following statistics——</p>
<p>Farm Cash Income. Total Subsidies Therein</p>
<p>1932. 4,377——</p>
<p>1933. 5,409. 278</p>
<p>1934. 6,267. 594</p>
<p>1935 (Expected). 6,700. 540 (Unit: Million USD)</p>
<p>But after the Agricultural Adjustment Act was ruled unconstitutional, although the government could not stop the payment of subsidies to farmers because of the contract relationship, this still has a major impact on future rural income, and thus the purchasing power of rural areas also has a danger of shrinking further. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Wallace gave a radio broadcast speech, saying that after the Agricultural Adjustment</p>
<h3>A Travelogue of Life in the Desert - (3)</h3>
<p>— Jin Dui</p>
<p>4. The Clothing, Food, and Housing of the Tibetan People</p>
<p>When we were in Qinghai, we needed to apply for passports at the Commissioner of Western Territories Pacification Office in order to delve deeper into Kham and Tibet. We learned that the Protector of the Nation, the Pacifying and Expanding Great Guardian Panchen Erdeni, who held the official title of Commissioner of Western Territories Pacification, was stationed at Tachen Temple, fifty li outside of Xining. So, we hired mule carts and traveled through the snow for an entire day before reaching our destination. It was already dusk after the moon had risen over the eastern mountains, so we stayed overnight at the residence of the staff of the Pacification Commissioner's wireless telegraph sub-station. This was a side room of a monastery. In the front middle row lived Wang Dejun, the head of the propaganda section, a Tibetan youth who spoke fluent northern Mandarin. It was said that he had previously studied at the Shanxi Military Academy and had followed the Panchen Lama when he was in Beijing. If he didn't wear his waist-tied Tibetan robe, you wouldn't be able to tell that he was a native Tibetan. After dinner, because I knew that Director Wang would be the interpreter for my audience with the Buddha the next day, I went to talk with him beforehand to prepare for the rituals and all the procedures. I also took the opportunity to ask about the Panchen Lama's entry into Tibet and Tibetan customs. He told me a lot about the general situation of Tibetan social life in terms of clothing, food, and housing:</p>
<p>A. Clothing: The highest class of Tibetan lamas, namely the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama, have two kinds of clothes, inner and outer. The inner garment is made of [a type of Tibetan-woven specialty]. The outer garment is a purple cashmere single shirt. There are two kinds of shoes, brocade shoes and embroidered slippers. Hats are divided into winter and summer styles. In winter, they mostly wear yellow pointed hats made of pulu and cashmere. Summer hats are shaped like bamboo hats and are made of gold-colored leather. The ranks of lamas are extremely strict, so although the forms of clothing are roughly the same, the quality and fineness of the materials vary greatly.</p>
<p>Officials have so-called Gabulun, with staffs. and Depa titles. On holidays or when attending to political affairs, they wear white gauze hats, green brocade short jackets with large collars and narrow sleeves trimmed with otter fur, black and brown pleated skirts, white soft-soled embroidered slippers, reddish-brown single shawls, swords at their waists, and large red flower satin belts.</p>
<p>From Gabulun downwards to the general populace, they all wear bone pendants. Commoners all wear large-collared, tightly sewn chubas without slits, and leather or wool belts around their waists. As for the inner and outer garments of commoners, they are roughly the same as those of middle-class lamas.</p>
<p>As for women, they wear pointed hats, mostly green, and brocade or cloth shoes. Their upper garments are short-sleeved shirts, and their lower garments are black, red, and brown skirts. They wear small cashmere square shawls, and one or two strings of prayer beads, regardless of wealth. Those who are engaged wear pearl crowns, adorned with precious stones and pearls. Elderly women wear a turquoise stone on their foreheads, set in gold. Women's hair is parted on both sides and tied like ropes, trailing behind their heads. Unmarried girls have a single braid behind their heads, adorned with jewelry and coral. Married women also have braided hair, but they wear the ornaments from the groom's betrothal gifts on their heads to indicate that they already have a husband.</p>
<p>B. Food: The staple food of the Tibetan people is tsampa. There is a plant in Tibet called "qingke," which is a type of wheat, dark purple in color, with grains slightly larger than wheat, and containing more protein and starch than wheat. Qingke is stronger than wheat of the same volume. Qingke is washed clean with water, dried, cooked, and ground into fine powder. Then, it is mixed with butter and kneaded into a fist shape, which is called tsampa (known as "Wudao hoop dim sum" by Han Chinese). Tsampa is very convenient to eat and is most suitable for travel and military expeditions, and it is also very nutritious. The strength of the Tibetan people's physique may be due to the efficacy of tsampa. Beef and mutton and dairy products are more expensive foods. As for rice, wheat, beans, and the like, because production is too small, they do not provide much support to the lives of the people.</p>
<p>However, because tsampa, beef, mutton, and dairy products are dry and greasy, one will get sick if one eats too much of them without tea. Therefore, tea is an indispensable drink for Tibetans of all classes. The method of drinking tea is very different from that in the inland. Patients in hospitals boil the tea, add butter and salt, stir it with a utensil, and then drink it.</p>
<p>There is no fixed time for meals. They do not use chopsticks when eating, but take food with their hands or use wooden bowls. After eating, they lick the utensils clean with their tongues, so there is no need to wash them in water. Meat must be cooked thoroughly with fire. The so-called "raw-grabbed mutton" seems to be a vestige of the ancient practice of eating raw meat and drinking blood. Banquets add wine and apricots, grapes, and other fruits as dishes to show respect to guests.</p>
<p>C. Housing: Tibetan architecture is not bad. You can imagine it by just looking at the solemnity and majesty of those monasteries and pagodas. However, because the Tibetan people are mostly engaged in nomadic life, living by water and grass, without fixed homes, they use tents to replace houses.</p>
<p>In Tibetan houses, in addition to monasteries and religious-style buildings, there are three types: watchtowers, blockhouses, and mansions. Watchtowers are made of stone, shaped like pagodas, with ladders up and down, strong enough to resist guns and cannons. Blockhouses are made of earth, which is a common type of house for the people. The lowest is a two-story building, and the highest is often six or seven stories high. The upper floors are inhabited by people, while the lowest floors are used to raise livestock. However, there are few windows, so the light is very lacking. Only small holes are opened in the roof for light and smoke to escape from. The interior is mostly unusually unclean. Mansions are most common in the Lhasa area. The building materials are stone or earth. They are mostly sutra halls where lamas hold meetings and recite Buddhist scriptures. There are also some mountain people who make a living by gathering firewood. For the convenience of their firewood-cutting work, they build houses on the mountainsides, which is also a common phenomenon.</p>
<h3>Guerilla Forces Active Again in Various Northeastern Provinces</h3>
<p>The puppet Forest Police of Mulan Disarmed; Japanese and Puppet Troops Along the Anfeng Line Weary from Running Around</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: According to intelligence leaked by the Japanese military, on January 31, in the forest between Fengshan and Mulan in Heilongjiang Province, sixty puppet forest police officers were attacked by more than 300 guerilla soldiers from Zhao's unit. The entire team was disarmed, and the whereabouts of the officers are currently unknown. The Japanese and puppet troops have dispatched troops from Mulan to urgently investigate the truth. The activity of the guerilla forces has been vigorous recently. The following is a brief account of the news of the puppet side's report on attacking the guerilla forces:</p>
<p>Because the Kwantung Army is carrying out the work of eliminating security, the security of the Eastern Border Road area can be improved. However, without implementing an active offensive, the momentum of the guerilla forces in the Anfeng Line area has gradually become rampant. This is because the guerilla forces have adopted guerilla tactics. When the Japanese and puppet armies arrive, the guerilla forces retreat to other places. When the Japanese and puppet troops are transferred away, the guerilla forces make a comeback. This time, the security and transportation on the Anfeng Line have been greatly threatened. The Japanese and puppet police have taken close contact to jointly maintain the security of the surrounding area. On the night of May 29, the Kwantung Bureau Police Team, hundreds of people, were transported by train to the key areas of the Anfeng Line (the Kwantung Army did not announce the number of troops). In addition, the puppet police chief of Benxihu formed a liaison police team and other independent teams. The first phase of the offensive work will be launched when the assembly is completed, and the troops of Tian He and Huang Chengguo, will be encircled and attacked. Moreover, the Benxihu police team, led by Inspector Shi Se of the Hiroshima Garrison Guidance, will be stationed far around the northwest. The Nambu team will advance from the east, and the Nakajima team will advance from the south. The Asakawa team bypassed the text. When the Shi Se team and the Hiroshima "Manchukuo" series troops arrived near Danjiabaozi, they learned that more than 100 guerilla soldiers from the Tian He unit were staying at Gaojiabaozi. In the severe cold of the snowy night, the guerilla soldiers stubbornly resisted the attacking Japanese and puppet troops. After about three hours of fighting, they were broken through the encirclement and retreated. In this battle, eight Japanese soldiers and more than ten puppet soldiers died.</p>
<p>On January 30, morning and afternoon, the Japanese and puppet soldiers and police advanced twice. At 4:00 p.m. on the 30th, the Nambu team encountered more than 150 guerilla soldiers in a secluded area west of Baishilazi. After an hour of battle, the guerilla soldiers retreated to the northwest. In the evening, the Kamiishi team attacked the guerilla soldiers on the Songquanling Line from below the Nambu team. After eight hours of fighting, the guerilla soldiers resisted desperately, and the Japanese army suffered heavy losses.</p>
<p>The Nakajima team advanced into the dangerous mountainous area. The Asakawa maneuvering team continued to advance, and the Sugihara team, in charge of the Daheyan guard, which was supported by the Liaoyang County puppet police team, attacked the guerilla base at noon on the 30th. They were ambushed by the guerilla soldiers and driven back. From 1:00 p.m. on January 30, Commander Dongjo, accompanied by his staff, inspected the guerilla forces and the Japanese and puppet troops' battle situation from the air in a reconnaissance plane, and used communication tubes to command the actions of the Japanese and puppet troops, but it still failed and many people died. All the wounded were admitted to medical institutions along the Anfeng Line. (Northeast News Agency)</p>
<h3>Sketches of the National Exhibition in the Capital</h3>
<p>The Products of Prisons in Various Provinces and Cities are Extremely Exquisite; The Various Products of the Northwest Industrial Company are Especially Beautiful and Complete.</p>
<p>Nanjing Dispatch: In recent years, the call to promote domestic goods has been resounding, but the trade deficit between China and foreign countries has continued to increase. In 1935, it even reached more than 300 million yuan. The decline of national industries is due to both external economic aggression and internal technical immaturity, which has led to the verge of collapse. At a stage where handicrafts are being oppressed by modern machine industries and social economy is following the end of the road, the National Goods Promotion Committee of all sectors in the capital held a national goods sample exhibition at the Jiangsu Public Education Hall, which is of great significance.</p>
<p>In the first counter at the entrance, sporting goods such as Datang and ping-pong paddles were displayed, which are products of the Jiangsu Shanghai Special Zone Prison. Many woolen products are also hung here, such as camel and variegated cotton yarn blankets, produced by Jinhua Jinsheng Company in Yuci, Shanxi; velvet chair cushions, produced by the Second Prison of Chahar; single-width jacquard cotton yarn blankets, produced by the Second Prison of Shanxi; towel quilts, produced by the Third Prison of Shandong and the First Prison of Hebei; and jacquard large yarn blankets, produced by the Shandong Juvenile Prison. Not only are the materials sturdy and durable, but the patterns and colors adopted are also very beautiful. In addition, a children's elm wood dining car and a rattan tricycle were displayed, produced by the First Prison of Hebei. They are new-style utensils that have been designed and manufactured, and they are rarely seen in the market.</p>
<p>In another counter, what is displayed is the clay figurines produced in Wuxi, including Awakening Lion, Eros, Confucius statue, Dongfang Shuo, Amitabha Buddha, Santa Claus, Laurel and Hardy, and Three Mothers Teach Son, etc., with a wide variety and overwhelming number. This is a famous product of Wuxi, and it also occupies a considerable value in children's toys. Unfortunately, the structure and color are not very beautiful.</p>
<p>The watercolors, pigments, inks, blue inks, waxed paper, and other stationery produced by Meilingdeng Craft Factory, Huimin Ink Factory, Sanmin Wax Paper Factory, and Qinye Stationery Company, etc., about a dozen kinds, used to be purchased entirely from abroad, and now they have all appeared in domestic goods.</p>
<p>Various antique bronze ink boxes, pen holders, antique bronze statue screens, leather box dragon and phoenix lion button red copper round seals, etc. from Desheng Hao in Peiping, and large and small writing brushes from Lu Yiyuan in Suzhou are also very famous stationery.</p>
<p>Iron window latches, various hemp flower drills, political round nails, drawing instruments, ten-inch vernier calipers, foreign locks, doorbells, silk buckle rulers, iron buckles, irons, revolution counters, etc. produced by the Northwest Industrial Company of Shanxi were displayed separately in a counter. Usually, we think that the above-mentioned livestock must use foreign goods, but now they can also be obtained in domestic goods.</p>
<p>Various porcelain made by the Baojin Iron Factory in Shanxi is also a very beautiful product. The porcelain produced in Jingdezhen, Jiangxi, is undoubtedly famous throughout the country. According to the reporter's observation, comparing the two, the products of this factory are not inferior. Especially in the northwest, there can be such excellent hardware materials and porcelain for the use of Chinese people, which is really a new force in domestic goods.</p>
<p>In terms of silk and satin, the lamp wick maoge, fisherman silk, qiaoqi velvet, Vienna, yingxue silk, great ni, luomian, etc. produced by Zhenya Weaving Company in Suzhou are no less than dozens of kinds. The products of various factories in Shanghai are not displayed much, but we can see the rest from the beauty of the products produced by Zhenya Factory.</p>
<p>Tapestry cushions are a unique product of Nanjing. Here are displayed many styles such as rice-colored dragons, red fierce light, blue-colored flying cranes, and Cornell University, all produced by Yang Chunji in Nanjing.</p>
<p>The sewing steel needles produced by the Jilu Needle Factory in Qingdao are also an excellent harvest in domestic goods. In the past, they were completely dependent on German manufacturing. The reporter recalled that during the European War, the source was scarce and the price suddenly increased several times. Now that domestic goods have also produced this kind of product, we can no longer be affected by foreign influences.</p>
<p>Throughout the exhibition, there were unusually alert slogans posted. "The only way to alleviate rural bankruptcy is to promote domestic goods." "To implement a new life, we should absolutely use domestic goods." "Children should develop the habit of absolutely using domestic goods in their childhood." "Do not buy foreign goods to give as gifts, do not accept foreign goods as gifts." "Wasting money to buy foreign goods is the most unwise behavior." The reporter toured the venue for a week and felt that there were very good products in domestic goods, but they were neglected by the general public due to the lack of publicity. If we want to promote the smooth flow of domestic goods, we must establish the belief in using domestic goods on the one hand, and on the other hand, we must make the products of domestic goods known to the general public. Here, I would like to call on the attention of domestic goods manufacturers. These are some of the reporter's personal impressions of the National Goods Sample Exhibition. (2.14)</p>
