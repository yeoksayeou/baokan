<p>時評</p>
<h3>日德反共協定的檢討</h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>日德反共協定成立的消息傳出以後。國際輿論譁然。關於締結協定的原因和利害得失。世人論者已多。現在我們從中國立塲。單就已發表的該協定的內容。略略來檢討一番。</p>
<p>第一。反對共產主義。不過是思想上的問題。日本國內的左傾思想。近年來因取締嚴密。已成緘默的狀態。而德國自希特勒執政後。共產黨亦幾無沽動餘地。卽使日德再要在國內加緊反共。這也祗是兩國各自的內政問題。不能成爲締結此項國際協定的理由。兩締的國的用意。顯然是要用聯合的力量。從第三國家得些好處。該項協定的叙文上有着這樣的幾句話。「倘若容忍共產國際對於各國（並非專指日德兩國）國內關係的干涉。則受到重大危險的。不祇是各該國的安寧及社會福利。卽世界和平也非受到威脅不可。」這暗示着。日德兩國打算以反共的名義干涉第三國的內政了。</p>
<p>第二。就協定本文第二條看。日德兩國對於他們認爲「受共產國際威脅」的國家。都要聯合給以相當的壓迫。使其加入反共集團。而日本外務省的聲明又特別注重中國。其中說「赤化的進行在遠東方面於中國爲特甚。中國本部共產軍跋扈允甚。」日本自國爲要防制共產國際的威脅而講求對策。我們自無間言。但赤禍在中國早成强弩之末。絕不如日本外務省所言那樣嚴重。卽使共黨在中國尙負嵎反抗。而中國自身力量亦儘足應付而有餘。何庸日人代爲過慮。日本這種聲明。不但漠視了中國的主權。簡直是別有作用的。</p>
<p>第三。就協定的性質論。在公開發表的內容中。雖沒有顯明的軍事同盟條欵。但協定正文第一條旣規定對共產國際的活動要採取合作防衛策略。而議定書又規定設置常務委員會。以辦理這合作的防衛事情。則軍事合作的意味已經够濃厚了。</p>
<p>以上所述。是就公開發表的部份而立論的。至於倫敦標準晚報所傳的秘密條欵。假使成爲事實。則德國將放棄收回太平洋舊有島嶼的主張。而對日本的南進政策開個方便之門。此其結果。日本大陸政策的推進。自必益無顧忌。而我國所處地位亦必益感困難。但就目前遠東國際形勢看來。恐怕這還不過是日本的一種幻想罷了。</p>

<h3>德日協定　目標所在　莫斯科報之觀察</h3>

<p>又「眞理報」評云、「四政府現亦將否認嘗與德簽訂任何密的、以愚該國之民衆、但斷不致成功、凡蘇聯政府舉出之可靠消息、皆能以文伴證明之、關於此點、日政府亦必巳經此試騐、於此吾人更可得一推論、卽吾人尙須繼續努力、爲和平爲集體安全而奮鬥、並繼續向戰爭製造家及其罪惡槍械進攻」（廿六日塔斯電）</p>

<h3>證券　公債交割一千九百萬元</h3>
<p>昨日華商證券交易所公債市塲、為辦理十一月份期貨交割期、交割總額計一千九百四十七萬元、內除各經紀人自行劃賬者有一千三百八十五萬五千元外、在交易所方面交割者、僅五百六十一萬五千元、收貨者以七十一號為最多、四十三·七十一號等則交貨亦屬不少、其市况之經過、自九月二十六日開始上塲因適有虹口發生事件、形勢極為嚴　、人心極度恐慌、行市逐步下降、至十月一日、局勢愈呈緊張、跌風益厲、市價一致接近開拍來之最低價、惟後空戶均多獲劣、亦漸見　弛、趨勢復轉上漲、十月十一日後時局消息極為沉悶、人氣亦多恍惚、市價於此時月期中、為多空相持堅定、作長久之盤旋、直至十一月一日後、多方　勢漸形擴大、　面趨勢亦甚挺秀、巿價緩步上升、十一十三日因有利多之傳說、漲風益猛、統一各償俱現第一次除息後新高價、後為多方漸多瀉出、而華北局勢漸呈嚴重、市况略呈回平、然至最後一日、因收貨踴躍浮空急於抵補、復起猛烈之軋空、惟因市氣之堅定、巿况雖居於時局嚴重下、尙難趨其這跌現象也、其過程高低相差、的計五六元至七元半、成交總額、計　萬三千一百八十九萬元、茲將其交割劃賬成交數列表如左、（單位百元）</p>

<h3>紗花　三品紗步步下跌　標紗行市漸相接近</h3>
<p>紗巿續漲、趨勢仍屬堅挺、良以某方面又來　批抱進、某君亦巨量購買、因此市情益乾　、市盤則仍然上升、但同業中多頭已大量出籠矣、大阪三品紗步步下墮、比高峰時已跌十元光景、查前幾日標紗比三品價低十餘元、本月收盤價　低一元六角矣、</p>
<p>浮戶軋直不少</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、承上日漲風續進、蓋以某君仍巨量拖進、致檯面殊緊、二盤聞大阪三品紗市回跌、目靑島紗價跌六元、人氣稍疲而挫、迨至收盤、因買者尙衆、又復回上、但有一部份同業仍拋出、標紗結果、近月比上日收盤價漲一元一角、遠漲二·五角、午後開盤、以三品紗續跌二元、市况平澹、二盤後、某方面仍來大批購買、市價向升、迨至收盤、漲勢更激、各月跳高一元、十二月漲破四十元關外、蓋以今日交割、後日星期、有一日停市之風險、一般浮戶軋直過湧之故也、結果各月比上午收盤價、又漲二元至一元三角、査賣出明德六千九百五十包、矚康一千三百五十包、德大一千五百包、錦昌三千三百包、賡豐三千二百包、昶記一千四百包、泰昌一千五百五十包、大昶四千四百包信誠一千一百包、源大一千一百五十包、振大一千二百包、益昶一千二百五十包、長豐一千一百五十包、買進聚興二千六百五十包、興昌一千七百包、森康三千一百五十包、望泰興五千三百包、元一二千一百包、永大一千四百五十包、益記一千〇五十包、合興四千二百包、仁豐一千五百五十包、同和四千包、一日間高低價及收盤列後、</p>

<h3>期棉後市補空突起</h3>
<p>棉市轉堅、市態益昂、良以紗市步步上騰、且高峯疊見、人心牽動、午後市價急趨上升、惟一般空方鑒於外棉無勁、拋賣不絕、但各產區之價、擯持甚力、</p>
<p>前市拋出為多</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、美棉停巿、印棉跌〇二五至一羅比、大阪三品花漲二角、然本埠市態平淡無勁、因投機商拋賣不絕、致檯面鬆懈、二盤後、因紗市良好、稍回堅、結果各月比上日收盤價跌一角、午後開盤市况平平、二盤後因紗巿良佳、至收盤時買戶補空並起、各月上漲、結果各月比上午收盤價漲二角半至三角半、査賣出、仁豐八千三百擔、裕大一萬二千四百擔、錦昌五千五百擔、德大三千六百擔、合興二千四百擔、長豐三千七百擔、澄記二千五百擔、聚興二千三百擔、大康一千一百擔、恒德一千一百擔、買進畏餘二千五百擔、泰昌四十擔、協成三千七百擔、福康一千七百擔、長和四千五百擔、新昶四千二百擔、明德三千九百擔、長餘四千二百擔、潤康三千七百擔、大昌成一千四百據、一日間最高最低及收盤價比較於後、</p>

<h3>美印棉停士三品紗下跌</h3>
<p>昨美印棉均停市、英棉現貨不動、期貨漲一二點、原電錄左、（二十六日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、廿七日開盤預測、白羅溪為二百十八羅比、跌〇·二五羅比、奧姆辣為一百九十九羅比半、漲〇·七五羅比、平果　為一百六十二羅比、跌〇·二五羅比、</p>
<p>二十七日大阪電、三品期紗跌四角至三元、近月為二百四十一元三角、遠月為二百十四元七角、期棉跌一角至漲五分、近月為六十五元六角五分、遠月為六十六元七角、</p>
<h3>疋頭　天氣驟寒　絨布門市生意突盛　昨雖紗綫微跌布市人心漸平　但客帮採辦仍旺故價難回小</h3>
<p>昨棉布市面、以現紗綫客銷不暢、紗價微跌、人氣漸平、惟現銷仍佳、售盤白貨漲每疋五分之譜、粵·桂·川·滇需要甚健、各當地售盤已能與滬市相埒、致現貨搜辦不遺餘力、成交以細布·細斜·輕磅粗布·縐紋呢·明星呢·士林布·藍布·直貢·嗶嘰·為最多數·此外期貨細布·細斜·十二月份期貨亦訂定五百餘件、與現貨市盤小（每疋）一角之譜、長江沿錢以水淺問　、各貨莫不爭先辦去、其中半數係儲藏性質、陝豫帮略有動辦、白絨·印花直貢·嗶嘰·黑地色丁等貨、直貢·嗶嘰·貨底仍豐厚、獨黑地色丁已吿匱乏、價漲（每碼）一分之譜、若按坯布價格之漲度、以後各　印花布疋及藍布·士林布·漂布·均須大漲、昨天氣酷寒、門市絨貨走銷突佳、深色藍布亦轉活潑云、</p>
<h3>糧食　期粉市氣甚為沉寂</h3>
<p>昨日粉巿、上午開盤後、各月份呈初穩繼定之象、洋麥報價、芝加哥停市、坎拿大近好四分、遠期一角六分、利物浦漲一辨士、故開價後、巿氣頗見挺穩、各月份較之前日、計好一分零、不過本月份甫經過去、遠期出人兩稀、成交甚少、因此趨勢停寂、難見振作、迨至下午開盤、因買氣更寂、各月份交易愈少、市面亦因之稍疲、較前日跌半分、觀此後情形、如北銷不暢、前途當少生氣云、</p>
<h3>多方略有脫手　近期麥獨見虛弱</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤、各月份呈近平遠稱之象、以洋麥報價、仍見微漲、當開價時、本月份已在交割時期、大的有三十九車交割、十二月因接近本月份、差度達一角外、未免過巨、因此人心不佳、遠期則拋戶不多、業外略有拉進、故較好二四分不等、迨至下午開盤、十二月份市氣仍軟、散多脫手、小去三四分、遠期則交易甚寂、上落無幾、現麥市面、遂趨挺穩、因陝帮動辦、人心易於激起、江北麥開六元一角、天台麥六元零四分、淮安麥六元一角三分、本埠廠家、共辦　千餘包、陝西帮辦淮城麥三十餘噸、價六元一角六分云、</p>
<h3>粳米仍靠北方銷路</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源更湧、共到百四五十號貨共三萬二千三四百石、內中薄稻有百一二十號、所幸包胃亦暢、北方辦進薄稻萬五千餘包、及厚粳近三千包、是以本街去路雖平、而巿况反能支持、厚薄粳價守定局、杜洋尖亦然、惟陰變元供過於求、呈帶軟之象、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各地到貨四十三四號、市上各貨銷路白梗店胃取價稍短者、有所動辦、市形定勢、羊埠杜尖　納平常、市價平疲、薄稻本街去化平常、客帮因聞得靑沛汆來廟等處阻止出運、致津烟等都續辦、形轉緊之勢、白元貨旺胃呆、價疲數分、其餘各價、疲中帶定、</p>
<h3>油市　從十個月桐油檢驗觀察　外銷大為减色　內銷雖見擴大終無外銷之鉅</h3>
<p>據實業部上海商品檢騐局報吿、十月份本埠桐油出口、經檢騐合格者、計一、六二九·五七公擔較去年同月之四、八一二·四二擔、减少三、一八二·八五擔、本年一月以降累計為八〇、四二七·六四公擔、較去年同期亦减少三一、〇〇四·四五擔、以言運銷國則對英·美·法及和國之輸出、均不及去年之盛、至內銷數量、月有遞增、本月對各口輸出數量、較去年同月增加二、一七七·一一公擔、本年（十個月）總數、較去年增加六、二八四·八五擔、惟銷納數量究不若外銷之可觀、故欲求桐油貿易之開展、須待於海外需要之轉機也、茲附外銷與內銷統計表如下、</p>

<h3>黃豆銷場殊乏興奮</h3>
<p>近兩日黃豆銷場、殊少興奮、市氣頗形萎縮、全市成交數不滿一千包、計開四平街豆一車、硤石黃豆四百包、丁家州豆七十二包、至收市時、聞得大連市續報回升、至由榨油廠裝進四平街豆十車、行情比早市所開之價、見挫三分、價為五元五角五分、前進之趨勢、刻下在醞釀中、一時未可預測、</p>
<h3>客秈到銷兩少</h3>
<p>昨日客秈市況、來源仍稀、產地禁運與限制之舉雖已解決、然以冬季水潤、運輸不便、且他埠直接運銷亦活、故產價步砌、販連日少、貨主因此多願隨市脫手、但昨日客化已淡、統市祇粵幫辦去四千包左右、汕頭去機元四五百包、本街應酬不多、市面始得扯、統計開出江西米一千八百八十六包、湘米九百包、甬台米二百六十包、大絞二千四百包、行情均與前市相似云、</p>
<h3>絲茶　輯里絲比上週漲十五元</h3>
<p>昨日紐約絲市停業（感謝節休假）、橫濱絲價則又見回跌、計現貨下跌二五元、期貨下跌二七元、故申市情況頗覺沉悶、法銷更無動靜、用戶亦鮮售開、昨日絲市僅達豐購白廠十包、永泰補進六十包外、餘無成交、印莊輯里絲及沔陽絲則續有走銷、如輯里下乾金馬之售五九五元、紅團龍之售六七零元、則較上週（十一月二十）漲十五元許云、</p>
<h3>波斯商採辦貢熙茶</h3>
<p>低莊珍眉綠茶、前因國外來電需求孔殷、存底不充、市價日堅、昨市又復回漲二三元、屯溪歙縣等路上中莊珍眉、銷路亦不寂寞、此外貢熙綠茶、波斯商行、亦因印莊銷路發動、紛起採辦、局勢漸佳、</p>
<h3>糖市　高黃崗青漲起四角　潮幫開出九十餘包</h3>
<p>昨糖市惟潮青以到稀升外、餘均平平、公會劃盤二四粗砂白現貨二十一元五角、又小五分、轉口六元〇八分、東白四八九號以及本廠綿白振記大華金心等牌、均無更動、號貨僅潮幫開出高黃崗青九十餘包、十三元四角、</p>
<p>合組公司昨為本週第三次橡兌粵糖之期、計總定額為一萬八千餘包、標價如前、當售出順德廠五羊粗白一、〇七〇包、惠州又五十包、均二十一元三角、市新廠又四一五包、二十一元一角、餘未成交、</p>
<h3>南北貨　海口枝到貨不多</h3>
<p>海口水東等荔枝干、近以產區造乏、辦價轉升、故來源寥寥無幾、查前日廣東輸入口總數、僅到十八件、此間號貨前到者均已開通、大部份均在行方手中、統共亦僅三千外箱、後市不易見鬆、且有轉緊之可能、</p>
<h3>雜貨　沙紅皮開價漲三元</h3>
<p>海口沙紅皮來源久稀、查日前瓊州輸入口、因僅到四件、因此市勢緊俏、昨聞已開至七十元、比升三元、其餘水挺皮及白水青以銷令已過、號方雖有手存、暫乏受主云、</p>
<h3>特載　我國桐油出口貿易之展望（續）</h3>
<p>— 宰君</p>
<p>最近二年美國建築費按月比較表單（註四）</p>
<p>位百萬美元</p>
<p>月份　一　二　三　四　五　六　七　八　九　十　十一　十二</p>
<p>年份　月　月　月　月　月　月　月　月　月　月　月　月</p>

<p>一九三六　五五　五二　七八　八四　八三　—　—　—　—　—　—　—</p>
<p>美國無論民主黨、或共和黨執政、其對於建築事必仍將繼續進行、以達繁榮之　、且美國新住宅之建築、及舊房屋之改造、均為今後迫切之需要、於最近數年內其建築事業勢必繼續以增、桐油為油刷房屋不可少之物、現美國建築事業既日在增進、則其需要桐油之供給、亦必甚多、自不待言、</p>
<p>吾人從上述各方情形觀之、可知英美德法諸國對於桐油之需要、今後皆有增加之傾向、此誠為我國桐油出口貿易之福音、然此僅有數字可查者方面而言、例如各國化學工業上之需要桐油、亦日有增加之趨勢、美國化學工業之製品、桐油為原料者、幾達八百餘種之多、且美國對用科學研究極為發達、今後對於桐油之用途、更無限量、倘歐洲各國亦與美國相同、則桐油之銷路更增、兼以桐油已為近世工業先進國所必需、又為軍需品之一、當此世界備戰時期、桐油之需要勢必增多、實為意中事、</p>
<p>總之、世界各國對於桐油之需要、於最近之將來、決不　無增加之傾向、可斷言也、況桐油向為我國所獨產、他國尚不克與我競爭、現在美國及其他各處、雖在竭力提倡植桐事業、專心壹志、以謀自給、但目下均尚無能為力、如一九二九年美國榨油商、曾呈請政府徵收我國桐油之進口稅、後經油漆商人、認為時期未至、乃暫行擱置、足見我國桐油在外國市場上之需要尚殷、吾人如能利用當前之良機、奮然振作、努力改進桐油之品質、增加桐油之產量、暢通內外之運輸、力減生產之成本、注意集　之組織、及排除外商之操縱等等、則　出口貿易之前途、更有無窮之希望、願國人經營此業者、及我國政府當局、有以注意及之焉、</p>

<h3>南菲洲施行苛例　摧殘我僑胞商業　國請願代表己抵滬　將晉京謁我當局請願</h3>
<p>申時社云、我國僑居南菲洲之僑胞、以當地政府、於明年起、將實行苛例、摧殘我僑胞商業、禁止我僑胞進口、特推派代表岑新一·梁次在·兩氏返國、向政府請願、與之交涉設法制止、以挽我該地僑商三百萬鎊資金於瀕危、現岑梁兩氏、業巳於前日抵滬、定今日訪僑務局長報吿後、三十日晋京、謁張外長及僑務委員會委員長陳樹人等請頗、茲錄其報吿書如下、</p>
<p>報告書</p>
<p>旅居南斐之華僑、為數的三千餘人、均為粵籍、多以什貨·衣館·菜園等業為生、華僑最初來斐之時間、的在一八八五年、而南斐杜省政府之苛待華僑、亦同時開始、蓋杜省政府於一八八五年、頒行黃金律、禁止亞洲人、及有色人種、在金鑛區域居住營業及購置不動產、華僑之居住營業及購置不動產於金區者為不合法、官廳隨時有勒令停業及驅逐之權、而杜省所有繁盛之都市、皆位置於金鑛區域、該例之不准華僑在金區居住營業者、卽不准華僑居住於各繁盛之都市、此華僑之所受壓迫一也、菲聯政府、以黃金律之權力、祗能施行於金鑛區域、不能施行於其他之鄉村巿鎭、故於黃金律頒行之後、又訂立</p>
<p>私城例</p>
<p>於各業主之地契中、規定不得將該實業賃租、或售予亞洲人及有色人種、換言之、金區外之各市鄉村、亦不准亞洲人營業居住、華僑旣不得居住營業於金區之繁盛都市、又不能居住營業於各鄕村市鎭、此華僑之所受壓迫二也、華僑在金區例私城例兩重之壓迫下、本早已無生活之可能、然為着生活之驅使、不得不拼命與惡劣之環境奮鬥、努力鑽營、以謀生存、適所謂黃金律與私城律、在立法上未臻完密、故華僑仍可苟延殘喘、惟斐聯不斷、將各苛例修改、以求縝密、故訴訟頻仍、吾僑不堪其苦、昔日領事當局、亦缺乏領導之能力、且不知國家之立塲、又不知菲聯苛例之目標、不在華僑、而</p>
<p>在印人</p>
<p>每每與印人聯合戰綫、印步亦步、印趨亦趨、豈知中國與印度之立塲不同、彼為家奴、我為獨立自主之友邦、安可與印人同日而語、故屢决反抗苛例、必遭失敗、菲聯政府、因華人與印度人聯合戰綫之故、益且將一切苛例、加諸華僑之身上矣、菲政府方面、因直接施行各苛例、頗不容易、故於一千九百二十六年、由杜省省議會通過營業管理法、授予杜省各市政府及鄉事局、以處理各區營業牌照之全權、凡市政府或鄉事局、取締亞洲入之營業牌照、無論其所持之理由為何、法庭不得干預、被取締者、亦無上訴之權、自該法規頒行之後、印入之商業牌照、無故被巿政府或鄕事局取締者固多、華僑商照無故被取締者、亦屬不少、此華僑所受壓迫三也、斐聯政府、因黃余律雖屢經修改、然因時勢之變遷、或法律上之疏虞、亞洲人不特能久延殘喘、而在金區居住及營業者、且日益增加、故菲政府為永遠斷絕亞洲人生活之計、特於一九二九年在斐國會、提議亞洲人賃居律、（未完）</p>

<p>張彭　演詞　略謂、此次太平洋國際學會、英法兩國代表所表示之態度、頗足吾人之注意及硏究、（一）英國各代表事先有充分之準備、故弁各方面表示頗整齊一致、深足取法、惟英人往日對於東方問題之認識、頗為錯誤、以為日本對華之活動、不至極端惡化、幷以為假使承認偽國、則日本當可滿意、但太會以後、英人深知日人志不在小、直有囊括東亞之企圖、（二）法國代表對東方問題、初無具體認識、但頗注意於（甲）世界和平有不可分離之整個性、（乙）維護集體安全制度兩原則、在大會中、甚為各國重視也、</p>
<p>朱友漁演辭　略謂本屆大會、吾國出席代表十六人日本出席代表十五人、其立塲各不相同、吾國代表純以學術為立塲、各種表示為正義而發、日本代表如芳澤·金井淸·坂西等、均係往昔日本政界聞人、說話均係偏袒政府、頗多曲解、對於日本對外貿易之進展、遭受各國反對、表示遺憾、而各國代表、以為日貨之所以引人嫉視、實因（甲）推銷手段不合、如在華走私等、（二）好用武力侵奪市塲等、</p>
<p>劉馭萬演詞略謂、此次返國、道經蘇俄、（一）蘇俄在各方面、均表示緊張、絕無懈怠情狀、其故、因日德虎踞東西、英法兼視於旁、（二）在俄旅行、頗不目由、到處均有團體代表一切、個人不能自由、（三）蘇俄生產、及消費機關、均由政府統制、對於生活需要之「卡片制度」、現雖取消、但實際需要之數量、仍有相當限制、（四）工資以有專門技術智並為高、工頭工資較技工為低工價照成績分配、由政府雇用大批專家、精密製成各部門工作標準、以資依據、（五）農係田集體、耕種、所用機器屬於公有、收入農產、一部歸政府、一部歸社會、一部歸機器方面、一部歸本人、</p>
<p>施博羣演詞略謂、太平洋國際學會大會、實際上並無若何具體結果、因該會係學術團體、並非政府組織、赴會後、余個人深感到現有外交機構、不足應付目前複雜局面、因外交須實力為後盾、否則托空言、無補於事、但在回國時道經各國、各國輿論、對中國自力更新、一致表示同情、此則可以引為慰者也、</p>
<p>駱傳華演詞略謂、此次本人出國、共經二十一處、對於各處僑胞情形、略加檢視、覺有三種優點頗可稱道、（一）愛國熱忱之高度發展、（二）經營公共事業之努力、（三）富有奮鬥精神、均足為國人模範云、</p>
<p>李幹演詞　略謂、本人對於此次赴會、略生感想、卽國際宜傳、固極重要、但事實表現、關係尤大、為國內政治上經濟上有良好之建設、表現於世、則國際批評、自能轉好、如此次吾國代表所提農村建設、及新貨幣、政府兩文、頗為各國所重視、卽其例也</p>

<h3>上海之搪瓷業　（續）　（上海工商業概況之卅八）</h3>
<p>— 中國微信主編</p>
<p>本埠各廠出品之銷路，十之六七全在上海本埠，其餘以銷長江流域為主，華南及南洋一帶所銷無幾，同時其所銷納者幾全為本埠各小廠之出品，以其跌價求售，易受顧客歡迎。普通各廠將貨推銷外埠時，概按九·七五折批發，如該外埠有洋貨競銷，各廠可按九·五折批發，貨欵則須現付或用十天期莊票，不行長期拖欠。</p>
<p>至各項搪瓷製品之市價，去年實行新幣制以後，曾一度高漲，最近因國際戰雲密佈，鐵皮瑯粉等原料較前昂貴，該業同行又於前月下旬開會，議决自同月二十三日起，將貨價一律增加百分之丘。按目前情勢而論，搪瓷製品之市價將繼續上漲，影響所及，一般購買力將隨之再减，此吾人所應注意者也。　（完）</p>

<p>婦女專刋</p>
<h3>匪偽侵綏聲中　婦女應負的責任</h3>
<p>— 華胥</p>
<p>幾天以來，匪僞侵綏的消息，儘再接再厲的報紙上刋佈着：這消息帶給我們熱血的腥味，帶給我們偉大的光榮。</p>
<p>尤其可喜的是，在此綏遠危急聲中，看到後方羣衆的熱烈援助，這使我們戚到無限的快慰與興奮。因爲，我們要是想像到前敵的忠勇將士們浴血抗戰的情緒；又如果看到戰區裏婦孺在災難中的慘况，那末再也不會有一點悠閑的時光，來讓我們作自私的享受，再也不會容許我們浪費一些物力，來填補自己的慾壑了。我們應把所有的力量去援助綏遠將士；並且希望我們站在時代之前的婦女界，節省一點時間，節省一點金錢，替自己的國家去效勞。</p>
<p>然而，使我們心痛的是在這暴風雨大動盪的時代，國家民族危急存亡的最後關頭：我們還會看到許多沒有靈魂的婦女，仍舊塗脂抹粉，淫佚奢侈；「商女不知亡國恨，隔江猶唱後庭花，」那不獨是我婦女界的一個奇恥大辱，而且是我中華民族的不幸—我在十一月二十一日，本市各報上，看到了一則「娛樂品在十個月中，進口總數爲七百七十餘萬元」的驚人報吿外，同時又讀到了一則關於婦女界消耗品輸入的報吿：——據載本年十個月中，上海化妝品進口總數竟達一百十餘萬元之巨，內計雪花膏粉十七萬四千〇三十四元，牙粉牙膏二十五萬〇八百九十九元，香水脂粉四十三萬五千五百七十一元，其他化妝用品輸入十七萬〇四百五十四元。其聲色犬馬之消耗，竟有如此驚人的數字，這實在是令人可嘆的一個現象！</p>
<p>現在，强鄰已經在用「逍遙津」的方式威脅着我們；所以，我們已沒有工夫躱在房問裏做太太小姐，更不能一天到晚的塗脂抹粉了。在這非常時期裏，婦女旣然同是國民一份子，當然也有救國愛國的責任，我們祗要看看過去的阿國婦女，和現在的西斑牙婦女，伊們是怎樣勇敢地在槍林彈雨，砲火烽烟的戰地裏出入，怎樣努力在後方幹着接濟與救護的工作。如今，我們綏遠的健兒，在冰天雪地中，忘記了寒冷，忘記了痛苦，揹着大刀和槍砲，在和敵人冒死抗戰，爲國家，爲民族，衝破了敵人殘酷的壁壘，揭起了民族自救的旗幟！然而婦女們雖不能親赴疆塲，但也應該將化妝品，裝飾品，燙髮，娛樂等一切費月節省下來，或製辦一些棉衣，馬夾，鞋襪，手套，帽子等拿去慰勞前綫的戰士…！</p>
<h3>事變前後的東北婦女</h3>
<p>— 吳江</p>
<p>現在平津一帶，被敵騎鬧得烏烟瘴氣，綏東吿緊的消息，紛至沓來，以及南京的中日調整交涉等，在在使全國上下的視聽，都集中在這幾點上，那呻吟在敵人摧殘下的東北婦女，已不爲人所注意，無待諱言，令人想起來，能不痛心！今僅將柬北婦女在事變前的生活和事變後的遭遇，略爲介紹於我婦女界，諒不爲無益吧？</p>
<p>東北文化落後，風氣不開，社會上的封建意識還很濃厚，什麼『女子解放』，『男女平等』的要求，簡直談不到。東北敎育向不發達，女子敎育史甚，女子屆受敎育的時期，却沒有受敎育的機會，各縣雖有二三小學——男女同學——點綴着，但都徒有其名罷了。辦敎育的旣不認眞，誰也不願送女兒入學，以爲入學，也學不到什麼，倒反學壞了，這由於『女子無才便是德』的舊觀念尚根深蒂固呀，是以女子敎育雖舉辦有年，一無進展。但自東北易幟歸順中央後，一切都有革新氣象　女子敎育也要振興起來，可是事變隨發，東北淪陷，一般婦女，更墮於悲慘之境了。</p>
<p>旣是處在濃厚封建意識下的女子，一到十五六歲，父母就爲之物色佳婿，以了向平之願，而伊們也只有謹從『父母之命，媒妁之言，』完成終身大事，當伊們在家做女兒時，每天要帮助家人燒飯做菜，打雜役，或照顧小弟妹，（當然大地主，大財富家小姐們，是無所事事的。）稍得閒暇，就端坐坑頭上，忙那自己結婚時的一切需要：如衣服，被褥，枕頭，鞋子……等，這些些東西，一件件要預備够下半世的需要…因爲一到婆家後，除吃食外，什麼都是自己的，結婚之後，每天只有天經地義的努作，和伺候翁姑的義務，那有什麼權利可享。所以伊們唯一的希望，就是快生兒子，生有兒子，以後那半世就有所依靠，而且生兒子也是翁姑日夜所祝禱的，那末至少可得翁姑的靑眼看待，這是遵循着所謂『三從』的古遺訓啦。</p>
<p>那受有中等敎育的女子，當然對自身有點覺悟，但除少數優秀或有奧援的，能獲得一種職業——如充小學敎員，也只有充小學敎員——外，其餘大部份都感到無出路的煩悶，於是以結婚爲唯一的法門，結婚就是她們最後的歸宿。形成這種沒出息的趨勢，自有其社會的因素在。</p>
<p>但，自九一八事變以後，在敵騎時來時往的擾攘的形勢下，一般靑年婦女，爲着避免姦汚，簡直走頭無路，哭訴無門。如吉林的舒蘭，榆樹……等縣，許多少女無可奈何的和當地的親友，或隣舍，都無條件的結了婚。而今數年來，　經過强暴的刦，屋宇被焚毀，田園爲佔去，家人不遭陷害，就淪於飢娥流離之羣，那有不遭蹂躪屈辱的（自然，在各大城市，敵人還會假惺惺的裝點斯文，但在各縣鄉村，就毫無顧忌了。）？除去那少數漢奸的姊妹女兒，被送往島國留學，培養成親×分子，和作奴化的工具外。</p>
<p>伊們這幾年在層層壓迫困苦中，激發起濃烈的民族觀念，深知做宰割的羔羊，或希望祖國的援救的非計，只有堅强自己的意志，和敵人拚命，才有生路，於是自動加入義勇軍的，日有所聞。她們在義軍中是有很大作用的，譬如偵探敵人的軍情呀，看護受創的同胞呀，洗濯縫補呀。伊們也有直接參加與敵對抗的工作，死無反顧，極爲悲壯的。我們女界姊妹們，國難已臨到最後關頭，速起來，傚法東北姊妹們浴血奮鬥，挽救民族的危亡呀！</p>
<h3>人工受胎的發明</h3>
<p>— 默</p>
<p>「人工受胎」這說起來似乎是不近情理而且是不可能的一回事，因爲沒有雄性的結合而能姙娠，這在人類是從沒有發生過的事。可是在這科學發達的二十世紀，却也有人埋頭的研究這一件我人認爲不可能的事，而且據最近的報吿，這種研究已是到了一段落，人工受胎的方法是被發明了。</p>
<p>從事於這種人工受胎方法的研究者是美國哈佛大學的生理學敎授，珂科克里。珂得伊賓卡司博士。在二年以前，博士曾採集了雌兔的卵球裝在瓶中然後再加上雄兔的精液，經過了二十分鐘之後把卵球取出而揷人於雌兔的喇叭管中，經過了卅三日之後，雌兔果然生出小兔六隻，由於這一次的成功，珂氏又再努力的研究下去，終於到了最近，得到了更圓滿的結果。在本年華盛頓舉行的實騐生理學會上，珂氏提出了很詳細的報吿，他的報吿就是人工受胎的研究，已達到比二年前更進步的不用雄性精液了。他用兔的卵球浸於鹽水之內再把其熱至一百一十三度以上而後揷入雌兔的喇叭管內，終於也生出小兔來，這方法較之於二年前，是更進一步了，珂氏並認爲人與兔俱屬哺乳動物，兔能人工受胎，則人類當也有可能了。</p>
<p>珂氏的這種人工受胎的發明，當然可以說是近代學術的一大奇蹟，可是這種發明之於人類或其他動物，却不一定是適合的，雄雌兩性的調和，這於生理上是有很大的影響的，假如把性的關係、取消而把處女實行人工受胎，則結果是使生理上起了變化的，而且事實上，也沒有人會願意那樣做的，根本上，兩性的結合而使兩方的發育調合，這是自然的法則，不但在人類，就是一切的動物，都是離不了兩性的生活的。所以，這種人工受胎法的發明，於人類也許是沒有多大的利益的，不過在學術史上，這種發明却不能算是白費的。</p>

<h3>周麗華女士談兒童教養</h3>
<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>母親沒智識，子女們不獲良好的生活；　母親不負責，比無智識的情形更可憐！</p>
<p>前幾天和三五位朋友談話，他們都是西洋畫家，所談的自然不出美術的範圍，其中有一位曾推荐到周麗華女士，說她對於西畫，下過廿餘年苦工，作品非常優秀，行將步潘玉良後，出其所作為本年海—　二度女子西洋畫展。當時我腦子裏就留下一個影子，果然不上半月，周女士的畫展，便出現於大新公司的　樓，抽了一些空，到會欣賞了一回；把二百多幅油盡，一齊看完，纔相信那位朋友的話，確是不錯。繪畫我雖是外行，好壞多少還能辨別出來。她的繪畫，不僅用感覺去支配色調，且有哀艷動人的情緒，寓意亦深還，眞是畫家中之富有思想者。例如「敵機下之同胞」，「白雪與赤血」，「永　」，「暴風雨下之和平神」……等數幅，簡直和我們報上每天所登的人標題不謀而合，這些好像前綫的寫生，刺着每個同胞的心靈，眞可以說是「國防的藝術」。今日的和平神，已在暴風雨中，和平之夢，原亦渺茫無期，處此惡劣情勢，惟有集中全國力量，予敵人以重創！</p>
<p>那天我先欣賞了畫，而後認識了她，彼此一見如故，席間談了不少的話，由談話之中，映出了她那爽直的生性，艱苦奮鬥和疾恨世人虛偽掩飾的精神，他說：「我生長於徐州，父親是江西瑞州人，所以徐州只能稱爲第二故鄉，十七歲　　，就久居於上海，自　專舉　後，」度在敎育界服務，後因家務牽累，不能出外做事，每天日是以　畫為惟一的工作。從小我就喜歡　盡，二十餘年來，　臺　沒　厭倦過。我的家庭生活，也和別人異　，自己不做事，丈夫的進益也有限，但我需要油畫的一切材料，都是價值昂貴的舶來品，我不願爲一浪費而荒廢我的　業，他也不會嫌我糜費太多，但我總覺過意不去，因此也有抵補的辦法，便是不雇備僕，燒飯，買菜，洗衣服，收拾屋子，都由我全部負責，把那雇用僕人的錢，拿來多繪幾幅油畫，是很值得的事。社會上一般人决不會明瞭一個人因着某種嗜好，而犧牲其他一切所得的精神上的快慰，有些朋友說我有點傻，爲何不用一個僕人，自己省省力，落得享福。這固然是一番好意，但不明白我並不因此而感到一點苦痛，反而因每天有固定的工作，心裏很舒暢，身體也健壯。他也領會我的心，而體諒我的力，帮忙我操作一切，因是相互間愈見親切，愈見融洽，這種代價，豈是金錢所能衡量得出一由家庭生活又談到了目前的婦女問題，她很沉重的說：「提高女權，唱了這麼多年，依然是男權中心的社會，女子有什麼地位可言？現社會正不知有多少可憐的婦女，呻吟於陰暗的環境之中，現在有兩種要人：一種是醉生夢死只知享樂的女子，一種是未受敎育過牛馬式生活的女子；她們懂什麼女權，有誰來解放？所謂提高女權，也不過痴人說夢，或等於日本人對中國人說「親善」無非小口惠而已。所以論女權，正不知從何說起，於是她不願再談下去，可是又轉到兒童敎餐的問題。</p>
<p>「兒童是每一個家庭中主要的份子，那末兒童的母親，最好、有智識的，懂得治家之道的，否則母親便是沒頭腦的人，什麼良好習慣，幼童心理，敎養方法都沒有，衛生更談不到，生在如此富貴之家，母親是有智識的，因為貪玩，愛交際，不顧家事，對兒童不負責；有的想經濟獨立，而出外服務，把兒童委託無智的傭人，隨便打罵，帶管無方，這種孩子，比貧家的子女更為可憐！可見為了經濟上的關係，而不把孩子好好敎養，不但一家損失，社會國家都有絕大的影響。由這問題，可以知道只有四種婦女，可以從事於職業的活動：（一）未婚的女子，（二）獨身的女子，（三）未生小孩的婦人，（四）孩子長大了的婦人，我想不合這四種條件的婦女，實不宜放棄其天職，老老實實的管理家政，盡心敎養兒童，如其經濟上發生問題，可謀相當的副業，雙方可並行而不悖。婦女的娛樂，自然也不能疏忽，我想最好以音樂，運動，書畫，旅行，影劇，或者找朋友談話，收切磋琢磨之效，此外不正當的消遣，實在太無意味了。」</p>
<p>關於大家庭與小家庭的制度，她也根據已往的經騐，的略說到：一婦女所認爲最難應付的，是大家庭的環境，一椿事情，翁是這樣說，姑是那樣說，因而夫婦的意見，也不一致，新舊的主張，難得融洽，各執成見，形成多頭政治，天眞的兒童，最會模仿，生在這種環境裏，最易染到不健全的思想與習慣所以破落戶必是大家庭蛻變的結果，敗家子也由於大家庭所產生，自然依目前的趨勢，無論鄉村與都市，應由大家庭改成小家庭的紙織，一夫一婦，互助合作，經濟公開，管理嚴密，號令統一，平時予兒童以良好合理的印象，子女的將來，决無越軌的行動，這是我對新家庭小小的貢獻。」</p>
<h3>內蒙婦女的婚姻</h3>
<p>— 雪文</p>
<p>爲了地域的蔽塞和交通的不便，蒙古同胞文化程度的較爲低落，是不容否認的事實。婦女大衆知識的落伍，也是不用諱言的，惟其如此，所以在內地喊得震天價響的『男女平等』的呼聲和『婚姻自由』的口號，彷彿對於她們是沒有什麼關係的——有也只是小小的一部分！</p>
<p>她們的婚姻，不用說：是在父母之命和媒〇之言的封建勢力之下，帶着濃厚的。交易化』的角彩，男女兩家訂婚，往往以若干隻牛羊牲畜等作爲聘禮，這和漢人舊式婚姻的『現錢交易』的方式，當然是另一種不同的新的姿熊了！</p>
<p>訂婚之後，要舉行一個『過禮』的儀式，預備下席筵，遍請親友來參加，大概是表示慶賀之意吧！這一天是非常熱鬧的。</p>
<p>至於結婚的儀式，是不完全甚同的，最有趣的，要算是新娘入門以後的『哭』，本來這在漢人舊式婚姻中也是有的，然而她們『哭』的很特別，不只是新娘自己一個人『哭』，而是要有好幾個女子陪着她一同『哭』，哭的是那末悲哀，彷彿是今生不能再見似的，而且一邊還訴說着，十分沉痛，使任何人聽了，都感到酸楚的滋味！這種『哭』的時間是相當長的。</p>
<p>其次一件事，要算是『搶骨頭』，這大概和漢人『鬧洞房』是相彷彿的，方法是在晚上，廚子預先留下一塊骨頭，新郎和新娘的女友或姊妹，一齊來搶，假如是到了新郞的裏當然若無何問題了，然而事實上十有八九是不會落在他的手裏的，這些女孩子們搶得了這塊骨頭以後，便如獲至寳似的，奇貨可居起來，她們把她放在案子上，新郞便哀吿她們，和她們要，原因是骨頭一到手。他便可以免去許多麻煩了，而她們呢，便想出種種的方法來作弄他，作爲交換的條件，最普通的是呌新郞給她們磕頭，有時是磕得很多的，等他『等因奉此』的照辦以後，她們又變卦了，便又要求他須唱多少多少個小曲，甚至要有千百之多，不過這是可以求別人來代替着唱的，常常要鬧到通夜方休，把新郞弄得個不亦樂乎，這雖是一件近乎取笑的事，然而却到今守此不渝的在奉行着，有些人簡直就把牠視爲一個『畏途』的。</p>
<p>她們的婚姻，雖是由父母來代定，然而却多半是很和美的過着日子，『離婚』兩字，是聽不到的，也許她們根本就沒有道種觀念呢！</p>
<p>她們對於貞操的觀念，非常的濃厚，很能奉行忠事一夫的信條，可是話得說回來，男子也是同樣的尊重她們的人格，『納妾』『休妻』的事情，是很少很少的。</p>
<p>短訊　自匪僞犯綏以來綏中將士愛國心殷，努力抵抗，舉國人民，聞風興起，紛紛接濟。本刊編者周瘦鵑氏近在蘇州聯合東吳大學事務主任施季言君公園主任范雲書君曁著名書畫家園藝家收藏家養魚家等數十人發起一慰勞綏遠將士審美展覽會，陳列一切書畫古玩花草金魚及其他美術品，以供愛美者之欣賞。地點假觀前宮巷樂羣社，日期自今日（二十八日）起，至十二月一日止，時間每日上午十時至午後五時，每券大洋四角，學生券减半，凡所收入，悉數匯綏勞軍，聞更徵集贈品數千件，每券皆得摸彩一次，以助興趣，甚盼海上士女，前往參觀，以襄盛舉云。</p>
<h3>活葬</h3>
<p>— 雪影</p>
<p>K縣眞是一處山明水秀的所在，別說中國人愛玩，就是外國人，一年也儘有好許多要趕上那裏去玩玩咧。可是這樣優美的環境，却特別例外的不能使那些在山水中長大的老百姓變得聰明起來，所以提到K縣，人們往往就會聯想到那些偉麗的山水和一羣獷悍粗野的土著，在那邊，的上幾百個人械鬥一塲，或把一個才死掉丈夫的寡婦搶去做老婆的事，眞可說是司空見慣的玩意兒。</p>
<p>孫子淸是一個五十多歲的老商人，原籍A縣，後來無非因爲生活的問題，流浪到了K縣，就在那邊成了家，還生了一個兒子和一個女兒。兒子在五六年前就流浪出去了，至今不曾有過一封信；女兒呢，因爲孫子淸年紀大了，不能賺錢，養不活她，故在兒子出門的第二年上，按照着常地的習慣，送給了一個開豆腐店的姓苗的人家當童養媳。女兒現在已是二十二歲的小媳婦了，可是苗家的那個豆腐店小開却還不會滿十六歲，依苗考板說，要過明年才給他們圓房咧！</p>
<p>一連下了幾天雪，老太婆病倒了，孫子淸他把自己歷年抄下的一本騐方新編取出來，摘了幾味藥，撑着一頂破洋傘，硬起了頭皮在大雪下趕到大道上去，想配一包湯頭回去醫醫他的老妻；正當他慢慢地走近苗家豆腐店門前時，忽覺得有些異樣，爲什麼小小的店堂裏擠着那麼多人啊？而且人聲又是道樣的喧鬧啊？因爲他女兒是這裏的童養媳的緣故，他便不由自主的想擠進去看一看。可是那一羣人突然又像浪花似的冲出來了，後面有兩人那麼長大的漢子用繩索綑着一個混身赤裸的小媳婦兒趕出來了。左邊的一個正是他的親家公苗老板，而那小總婦雖然已染上了混身的血汚，臉色也變得像好久不曾下雨的泥土一樣，可是本來的面目，媳還不曾改變，正是他的女兒啊。他的那柄破洋傘已在他手裏落下去了，他的身子也在搖晃了，好容易才掙扎出了五個字來：</p>
<p>「你們幹媽喲……」</p>
<p>他這麼一嚷，至少也讓苗老板聽到了，但他並不就停止他的脚步。</p>
<p>「你女兒倫漢，要拿去活葬」！怪乾脆的答復。同時，無數的人全在發出野獸一股的吼聲來：「活葬」！「活葬」！他們都像逢到賽會一養的興奮，據着中間三個人在大雪下趕望東去了。</p>
<p>「爸爸……救命啊……」孫子淸仿彿聽到有一種慘厲的呼號聲在他耳膜上刺着，不由使他忘掉了一切，揮着雙拳，望那人羣中撲去。他用他的手，脚，頭，甚至已經殘缺的牙齒拚命想把他的女兒救出來，可是一個老頭子有什麼用呢？他的衣服全給那些野獸們撕破了，他的白鬚白髮也快落盡了，他被推倒在雪地裏，眼看着女兒給他們架遠了。</p>
<p>「活葬我吧！……活葬我吧！……」他盡着他所有的力氣呼號着：終於，他自己也給無情的大雪活葬下了。</p>

<h3>關於諾貝爾和平獎金</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>報載諾貝爾和平獎金委員會，頃决定以本屆和平獎金，贈給阿根廷外長賴瑪斯，至上屆和平獎金，因當時並未决定贈給何人，茲亦决定贈給德國和平主義作家奧西埃資基。</p>
<p>諾貝爾和平獎金，係設置以贈給有功於和平事業者。如本屆得獎人賴瑪斯，曾以提議締結泛美互不侵犯公約，及召開大廈谷和平會議，有功於和平事業。與上屆得獎人奧西埃資基，係一和平主義者，因信仰和平主義，曾被本國當局拘於拘留營，為時已有兩年之久，至最近始開釋。</p>
<p>但此事頃德國當局，已有所表示，謂奧西埃資基係一著名叛徒，曾以叛逆罪被拘，判處拘役，最近予以開釋。諾貝爾和平獎金委員會，茲乃以和平獎金，贈給此叛徒，實係侮辱新德國之行為，跡近挑戰，是而可忍，孰不可忍，德　府卽常有所公佈，明白予以答覆。</p>
<p>諾貝爾和平獎金委員會，决定以上屆和平獎金，贈給德國和平主義作家奧西埃資基，甚為合宜。因奧西埃資基為和平主義者，有功於和平事業。然此事之引引起德國當局之反對，亦非無理由。因奧西埃資基曾攻擊本國之侵略政策，不容於政府，被判以叛逆罪。此叛徒而得和平獎金，在德國當局不能容忍。</p>
<p>不過德國當局之表示憤慨，一方足以暴露新德國之行為，與和平不相容。一方亦足以說明奧西埃資基之有功於和平事業，得和平獎金而無愧。奧西埃資基因信仰和平主義被拘，實為一鐵蹬。</p>
<p>記得曾有人提議，本屆諾貝爾和平獎金，應贈給德國元首。理由據謂，今日歐局之所以能維持和平，皆為德國元首一人努力於和平事業之結果。可惜此議不僅不為諾貝爾和平獎金委員會所採納，該委員會且將上屆和平獎金，贈給德國政府之叛徒，此舉莫怪要被認為侮辱。</p>
<p>最近德國反共協定，業已成立，德國又完成一和平事業。諾貝爾和平獎金此際若尙未决定，贈給何人，實有加以斟酌之必要。在阿根廷外長賴瑪爾，及德國和平主義作家奧西埃資基，已被决定為得獎人，和平獎金，巳落在彼等之身上。德國當局之反對，大約不至於產生效力。</p>

<h3>鴿子</h3>
<p>— 林加</p>
<p>冬日小品</p>
<p>北國的冬天是常落雪的，雪停後，剛露出地面的碧色麥苗，便也給埋沒了。田野上一片白茫茫地銀光，老鴉棲在枯樹枝頭，欠着身子刮刮的喊，灰陰的天空下，寒風穿過街巷嗚咽咽的吼着，郊野靜寂了，人們都悶在屋里，老年的也許圍着隻炭爐在打瞌睡。整個的樹林像蒙着伴大白氈子，乖孩子似的睡熟了。</p>
<p>家門前有一片空蕩蕩的塲院，風雪息下來時，弟弟便常拿着小掃帚去掃雪，塲上的雪給推到官道邊，一片平坦的黃土地露出來。他把箥籮扣下，用一隻二尺高的木杆支起，杆根上拖着一條長長的麻繩灣灣曲曲直拉到木柴門里，陷阱佈置好了，這淘氣的孩子喜悅的作着鬼臉，悄悄打糧食缸中捧出兩把玉米，在箥籮的最里邊密密的撒下，塲上零散的丟到那個陷阱口，他便牽着繩索蹲在木柴門後面，仰起那小腦袋偷看着塲上的動靜。</p>
<p>在到處都舖蓋着雪花時，鴿子每看見一片黃色的泥土，都要展開翅膀低低的掠着地面去看看，有兩隻喜動貪饞的鴿子，發現那地面上零落的浮了許多黃色的粒子，便咕咕地呌兩聲，展着翅膀，輕的飛跳着，在邊沿上啜食一兩顆，又驚慌的看看那個黑色的怪物，待重伏下頭吃幾粒，仍靜靜的沒有什麽驚擾，立在對面高房的垜口上的那些瞪着小紅眼睛穿瓦色袍子的小伙伴們，便也一個個像秋風下的枯葉似的，飄飄的落下來。沿上的粒子吃光了，胆大的向裏面一顆一顆的啜，漸漸牠們不顧忌了，爭先的搶那黃色的晶瑩的粒子吃，等箥籮外面全被吃完，偸看看那張着嘴巴般的箥口，又有點怕，重飛離開地，四外偵察一陣，胆小的在旁邊一跳跳的看動靜，偵察回來再落地時，便什麽也不瞅，直趨箥籮里面那堆豐滿的食品，叩頭虫般的啜着，呆在後邊幾個猶豫的，便也英勇的轉往里面去，跟那些伙伴打對臉爭吃起來。</p>
<p>弟弟的手扯緊了繩子向後面猛的一拉，甫的聲，沒有被扣住的慌得一反身急閃閃飛回垜口去，籮里面普拉拉的響着，弟弟喜悅的提着那個特製的圈網兜，把箥口輕掀開個縫子，網兜在那縫處支開，鴿子見外面透進一綫亮光，便掙扎着向外鑽，待急忽怱跑出，以為自己得救了却也讓弟弟隔了一層網綫捉住。</p>
<p>晚間在灶頭邊殺了，放在滾開的湯鍋里煮，父親第二天便得酒菜了。</p>
<h3>歌聲</h3>
<p>— 李勵文</p>
<p>海呀！</p>
<p>海呀！</p>
<p>魚兒——來吧！</p>
<p>哎哎喲——</p>
<p>捕魚的人哪——笑啦。</p>
<p>海呀！</p>
<p>浪呀！</p>
<p>在芝拉扎海邊的鄉村裏，這歌聲曾鈎起過我無限的幽情。那時，我正因為腦病被送到那邊一位親戚的家裏靜養。那親戚是個塘主，擁有數十口塘·他的西式的木造房子在村裏是最美麗最堂皇的建築。從村口，遠遠地望過去那被包圍在綠樹叢中的紅色屋頂，幾乎被認為是村裏唯一幸福的樂土。許多人向牠投視着羨慕的眼光；小孩們喜歡在門口草坪裏聚集起來，向房子作着各種奇特美麗的幻夢。我的窗口，正對着草坪。很多時候，歌聲使從窗口驅進來，柔柔地輕盪在聒靜的空氣裏。那些時侯，我沉醉起來了，靜靜地躺在床上諦聽着那種溫情的歌聲做我的夢。或者，步到海邊，呆立在輕軟的沙灘上，眺望着一望無涯的大海，看大海在溫熱的陽光下閃着金波，聽大海在和風的撫摩中低聲輕唱。……</p>
<p>不久，我也熟習了那支歌了。牠凉潤着我，彷彿在大沙漠裏洒下了一塲甘雨。於是：在極度平靜的時侯，在夜裏風送過來樹葉和大海的私語的時候，在窗口遠眺着那浩蕩的跳躍的海水的時候，或者，在孩子們的歌聲輕輕地從窗口爬進來的時候，我也低唱起那支歌來了。</p>
<p>我的病，慢慢變得好起來了。</p>
<p>可是，有一天，村裏突地發生了一件大悲劇：五十多艘出海漁船祗回來了四五艘，其餘，深深埋葬到括起大風浪大海裏去了。村裏被籠罩上無可補償的大悲哀。從人們臉上，從孩子們嘴角邊，極罕找得出那絲微笑了。——詩一樣沉醉人們幽思的歌聲也不再嚮起來了。</p>
<p>親戚們不曾感動在這陣哀氛裏，他們仍然過着一樣的生活。然而，在我，我的心顫動起來了，吹來的海風使我頭痛，深夜裏婆娑着的葉浪使我彷彿又聽到那支歌聲，我又失眠起來了。我的心落在村人們心裏。……</p>
<p>幾天以後我寫信給父親，把我的悲哀寫在每一個字上——於是，在一天早晨，我悄悄地離開了芝拉扎，帶着一顆悲哀的心回到了巴達維亞州府。</p>
<h3>凍瘡特效藥　未破的當天消腫　已斕的指日收功</h3>

<h3>新客衙</h3>
<p>— 柳明</p>
<p>我們　這苦難的，沒有受到祖國的庇護的一羣，現在被趕進這臨時的監獄來了。許多人呌這地方作「新客衙」。</p>
<p>這是一座相當偉大的建築，四面是水門汀的厚厚的牆壁，嵌着鐵條排成的方窓。現在我們完全跟外界隔絕了，剛才在最後的一個同伴進來之後，鐵門便立刻關上下鎖了。</p>
<p>孩子們同婦人們的哭聲漸漸低弱下來了。有許多人坐在潮濕的地面上，用着逃荒者一樣的神色凝視着每個同伴，一個老婦人哭着自語着說：</p>
<p>「為什麼把我關進來呢？天啊！」她絕望地搖着雙手。「我又沒有犯什麼罪。為什麽連我這快進棺材的老女人也帶進來呀！你們這些絕種絕孫的！你呌我的仁兒到那裏去找我呀？」</p>
<p>她那沙啞的聲音不斷地響着，說了又停，停了又說，老是拉起衣裙揩她的眼睛，雙手時時搖擺着，像在招呼什麼人一樣，接着她竟用高聲嚷起來：「你們這般勿好死的五路分屍的人呀！我看你關我到什麼日子？關我到什麽日子！你們這些絕子絕孫的人喲！我上世刨了你祖宗的墳，打碎你祖宗的灰金甕」麽？……」</p>
<p>這凄厲的聲音使我們戰抖起來，許多人的意識給這厲聲喚醒了，就全都低聲咀咒起來，整座房子的空間充滿着憤怒的聲音。</p>
<p>然而非在明天早上不能出去的事情已蚤行决定的。我們心裏雖然戚到苦楚同不平，但起伏不定的心緖終於緩緩地平復下來，同時飢餓的感覺也接着抬頭了。</p>
<p>一想到這種非入的待遇，在我們之間，一種憤激的情緒又猛然掀動起來。</p>
<p>一要把我們餓死麼？坐監也有米飯吃的！媽的，我們還算是入麽？」一個靑年人這樣說。接着轉過身來，用着挑戰一樣的態度對我說：</p>
<p>「生作中國人眞觸霉頭！你說坐「馬鬃」的中國人不是老早就卞船去麽！」</p>

<p>答：（一）第二期梅毒。（二）骨痛，脫髮，淋巴管腫。（三）此症根治頗難。（四）先注射六〇六，每星期一針，連續六針，同時注射『尅爾梅星』（Carbisin）一打，每三日一針。休息二個月，騐血呈陰性者不再注射，但六個月後仍須再檢査一决。如二個月後騐血仍呈陽性者（有毒），須再如上法注射，至呈陰性（無毒）為止。（五）視侵入部位而異：侵腦者為腦梅毒；侵脊髓者為脊髓梅毒；侵肝者為肝梅毒。厥症實多，非一言二語所能盡。</p>
<p>呼吸困難</p>
<p>第一一一號，河南路三馬路口任醒余君問：舍親某君，於民國二十二年冬因疲勞過度竟患慢性心臟病。病發時氣急非常，呼吸困難，不能坐臥，僅能起立行走，因是精神日劣。初延中醫醫治，毫無寸效。後則延西醫×××等醫治，雖打針服藥，而病情並無進步，反愈治愈凶，幾瀕死境。後得友人介紹，往××醫院日醫××處醫治，一决診後，竟能臥倒，其後經診治十餘次，竟巳復原。惟舍親醉心中醫，同時更以××之藥麻辣難服，不願再診於日醫，卽再延中醫×××診治。初時大概也許是病在恢復時期吧，故尙進步。可是再復發時，該中醫也束手無策。再往日醫處就診，一劑卽瘥。不過每每復發，不能斷根。迄今三載，經濟吿匱，所以自去年春間以還，尙屬每月一發。發卽往日人處就診，診後卽瘥。而現今則有時因經濟關係，不去就醫。以是本月竟發三四决，中間曾往××醫院及×××醫師處就診，不過毫無效果。歸納之下，有數點疑問，至祈先生指敎：（一）據日醫云：『該症為慢性心臟病，自肋間而起，以致心臓肥大，呼吸困難。極忌身心過勞，並煙酒肉等。因非長期醫治，迄今已無痊愈辦法』，不知然吾？（二）其他西醫之藥，因何無效，僅日醫之藥，一服卽能平氣？該藥之味甚麻木，服後常嘔吐！『泡立水』器具遇之卽發白，不知何種藥劑？（三）該症刻下服何藥最有效？</p>
<p>答：貴友之病是心臟性喘息，原因極多，或為紋心症，或為心筋炎，或為心力衰弱。至於（一）松井所云，余未診査，當然無從批評是否正確，但旣經伊診查而發是論，當不致錯誤。（二）批評一醫師之學術，不能但憑其某一劑藥之有無效果，此××或對此病有特殊之經騐也。凡類脂肪性藥劑及芳香性藥劑均能使『泡立水』變色，故單憑此點，不能推知是何藥。（二）旣然××之藥有效。以卽委其手診治為妥。實在因所云『經濟吿匱』，則內服『複方樟腦酊』（Tincura.　Campho.　Conpound）及『麻黃素』（Ephedrin　Sulphate　“Star　Brand”）可也。前每服一錢，後者每服一二片。服時加以最大之注意！</p>
<p>兩胃痛疼</p>
<p>第一一二號，王樹之君問：賤內素有月經不調病，自見先生之答某君之信，上有服『當歸兒』語，連服數瓶後已全愈。但賤內同時尙有腹痛病，痛在兩脅，且有一定時間，卽月經後之十三日至十六七日。腹痛時在床打滾，冷汗浸淫。雖曾請醫診治，但類多止痛於一時。故請（一）先生介紹良藥！（二）此痛經多數醫生診査，言人人殊，所謂國醫，更是欺人，連請七位國醫，竟說出七種病名，而服下之藥，竟如石沉大海，並止一時之效亦無之，請問先生，此病到底何名？（三）何故而起？</p>
<p>答！（一）服『戒痛』（Chatone）腹部用『三福消腫膏』（sanfjoid）熱敷亦有效。平時以常服補藥，如『利凡命』，（Livemin）或注射『補爾神』（Blusen）等為佳。</p>
<p>食慾不進</p>
<p>第一一三號，韓慕塵君問：敝人自前二月患赤痢，後來針藥並施，未一週而愈。但茲後常患便秘，飲食不進，見飯生厭。近日取鏡自照，面黃肌瘦，與未病前竟判若兩人，以是非常憂慮。請示療法！</p>
<p>答：注意烹調，服『阿賽多斯陪潑辛』（Acit-ose-Pepsin），便秘時田『甘油栓』（Glycerin　su-ppository）塞入肛門。</p>
<p>（慢性白濁）</p>
<p>第一一四號，福建壽寧縣政府鄭白君問：敝人患白濁已歷四决，有服草藥而愈者，亦有經注封『果能尅淋』（Gonacriudin）而愈者。但此次偶因房事過度，舊疾又復發。不知是否身體過虛，或婦人生殖器不潔，致常染此病。初起時並不十分痛疼，白濁亦無多。以本縣無西藥房，又無醫生注射，故服六七劑本地土草藥。現已漸决而愈，但不能全然斷根，每一日夜仍有濁一二滴洩出，發陽時亦毫不刺痛，與無病無異。長此延期，（一）對生育上有無妨碍。（二）並請介紹良藥（三）果能克淋內服片價格幾何？請一並示知。</p>
<p>答：閣下與尊夫人是慢性淋病。閣下以為痊癒之時，其實並未痊癒，不過淋菌暫時潛伏，不顯症狀而已。該病一遇時機許可，（如飲酒，過勞）卽又發作。至所謂『身體過虛』及『婦人生殖器不潔』，則無關。（一）單生本病無害生育，但男子惹起前列腺炎，睪丸炎，精囊炎時，女子惹起卵巢炎時，則生育絕望。（二）慢性淋病非單靠內服藥所能治燎。請另用『含銀果能尅淋』（Argonnacrindin）冲洗，每日二次，連續一個月，不能間斷。在此治療期內停止房事，以防互相傳染，妨害治癒。</p>
<p>（癬）</p>
<p>第一一五號，錢淸君問：敝人自己不愼，不知何處染來乾癬，在臀部及兩下腿內側，搔癢異常，請示療法。</p>
<p>答：用『一〇％抑酸醑』（SpiritusAcid　Salicylic）塗擦。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>關於諾貝爾和平獎金</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>報載諾貝爾和平獎金委員會，頃决定以本屆和平獎金，贈給阿根廷外長賴瑪斯，至上屆和平獎金，因當時並未决定贈給何人，茲亦决定贈給德國和平主義作家奧西埃資基。</p>
<p>諾貝爾和平獎金，係設置以贈給有功於和平事業者。如本屆得獎人賴瑪斯，曾以提議締結泛美互不侵犯公約，及召開大廈谷和平會議，有功於和平事業。與上屆得獎人奧西埃資基，係一和平主義者，因信仰和平主義，曾被本國當局拘於拘留營，為時已有兩年之久，至最近始開釋。</p>
<p>但此事頃德國當局，已有所表示，謂奧西埃資基係一著名叛徒，曾以叛逆罪被拘，判處拘役，最近予以開釋。諾貝爾和平獎金委員會，茲乃以和平獎金，贈給此叛徒，實係侮辱新德國之行為，跡近挑戰，是而可忍，孰不可忍，德　府卽常有所公佈，明白予以答覆。</p>
<p>諾貝爾和平獎金委員會，决定以上屆和平獎金，贈給德國和平主義作家奧西埃資基，甚為合宜。因奧西埃資基為和平主義者，有功於和平事業。然此事之引引起德國當局之反對，亦非無理由。因奧西埃資基曾攻擊本國之侵略政策，不容於政府，被判以叛逆罪。此叛徒而得和平獎金，在德國當局不能容忍。</p>
<p>不過德國當局之表示憤慨，一方足以暴露新德國之行為，與和平不相容。一方亦足以說明奧西埃資基之有功於和平事業，得和平獎金而無愧。奧西埃資基因信仰和平主義被拘，實為一鐵蹬。</p>
<p>記得曾有人提議，本屆諾貝爾和平獎金，應贈給德國元首。理由據謂，今日歐局之所以能維持和平，皆為德國元首一人努力於和平事業之結果。可惜此議不僅不為諾貝爾和平獎金委員會所採納，該委員會且將上屆和平獎金，贈給德國政府之叛徒，此舉莫怪要被認為侮辱。</p>
<p>最近德國反共協定，業已成立，德國又完成一和平事業。諾貝爾和平獎金此際若尙未决定，贈給何人，實有加以斟酌之必要。在阿根廷外長賴瑪爾，及德國和平主義作家奧西埃資基，已被决定為得獎人，和平獎金，巳落在彼等之身上。德國當局之反對，大約不至於產生效力。</p>

<h3>鴿子</h3>
<p>— 林加</p>
<p>冬日小品</p>
<p>北國的冬天是常落雪的，雪停後，剛露出地面的碧色麥苗，便也給埋沒了。田野上一片白茫茫地銀光，老鴉棲在枯樹枝頭，欠着身子刮刮的喊，灰陰的天空下，寒風穿過街巷嗚咽咽的吼着，郊野靜寂了，人們都悶在屋里，老年的也許圍着隻炭爐在打瞌睡。整個的樹林像蒙着伴大白氈子，乖孩子似的睡熟了。</p>
<p>家門前有一片空蕩蕩的塲院，風雪息下來時，弟弟便常拿着小掃帚去掃雪，塲上的雪給推到官道邊，一片平坦的黃土地露出來。他把箥籮扣下，用一隻二尺高的木杆支起，杆根上拖着一條長長的麻繩灣灣曲曲直拉到木柴門里，陷阱佈置好了，這淘氣的孩子喜悅的作着鬼臉，悄悄打糧食缸中捧出兩把玉米，在箥籮的最里邊密密的撒下，塲上零散的丟到那個陷阱口，他便牽着繩索蹲在木柴門後面，仰起那小腦袋偷看着塲上的動靜。</p>
<p>在到處都舖蓋着雪花時，鴿子每看見一片黃色的泥土，都要展開翅膀低低的掠着地面去看看，有兩隻喜動貪饞的鴿子，發現那地面上零落的浮了許多黃色的粒子，便咕咕地呌兩聲，展着翅膀，輕的飛跳着，在邊沿上啜食一兩顆，又驚慌的看看那個黑色的怪物，待重伏下頭吃幾粒，仍靜靜的沒有什麽驚擾，立在對面高房的垜口上的那些瞪着小紅眼睛穿瓦色袍子的小伙伴們，便也一個個像秋風下的枯葉似的，飄飄的落下來。沿上的粒子吃光了，胆大的向裏面一顆一顆的啜，漸漸牠們不顧忌了，爭先的搶那黃色的晶瑩的粒子吃，等箥籮外面全被吃完，偸看看那張着嘴巴般的箥口，又有點怕，重飛離開地，四外偵察一陣，胆小的在旁邊一跳跳的看動靜，偵察回來再落地時，便什麽也不瞅，直趨箥籮里面那堆豐滿的食品，叩頭虫般的啜着，呆在後邊幾個猶豫的，便也英勇的轉往里面去，跟那些伙伴打對臉爭吃起來。</p>
<p>弟弟的手扯緊了繩子向後面猛的一拉，甫的聲，沒有被扣住的慌得一反身急閃閃飛回垜口去，籮里面普拉拉的響着，弟弟喜悅的提着那個特製的圈網兜，把箥口輕掀開個縫子，網兜在那縫處支開，鴿子見外面透進一綫亮光，便掙扎着向外鑽，待急忽怱跑出，以為自己得救了却也讓弟弟隔了一層網綫捉住。</p>
<p>晚間在灶頭邊殺了，放在滾開的湯鍋里煮，父親第二天便得酒菜了。</p>
<h3>歌聲</h3>
<p>— 李勵文</p>
<p>海呀！</p>
<p>海呀！</p>
<p>魚兒——來吧！</p>
<p>哎哎喲——</p>
<p>捕魚的人哪——笑啦。</p>
<p>海呀！</p>
<p>浪呀！</p>
<p>在芝拉扎海邊的鄉村裏，這歌聲曾鈎起過我無限的幽情。那時，我正因為腦病被送到那邊一位親戚的家裏靜養。那親戚是個塘主，擁有數十口塘·他的西式的木造房子在村裏是最美麗最堂皇的建築。從村口，遠遠地望過去那被包圍在綠樹叢中的紅色屋頂，幾乎被認為是村裏唯一幸福的樂土。許多人向牠投視着羨慕的眼光；小孩們喜歡在門口草坪裏聚集起來，向房子作着各種奇特美麗的幻夢。我的窗口，正對着草坪。很多時候，歌聲使從窗口驅進來，柔柔地輕盪在聒靜的空氣裏。那些時侯，我沉醉起來了，靜靜地躺在床上諦聽着那種溫情的歌聲做我的夢。或者，步到海邊，呆立在輕軟的沙灘上，眺望着一望無涯的大海，看大海在溫熱的陽光下閃着金波，聽大海在和風的撫摩中低聲輕唱。……</p>
<p>不久，我也熟習了那支歌了。牠凉潤着我，彷彿在大沙漠裏洒下了一塲甘雨。於是：在極度平靜的時侯，在夜裏風送過來樹葉和大海的私語的時候，在窗口遠眺着那浩蕩的跳躍的海水的時候，或者，在孩子們的歌聲輕輕地從窗口爬進來的時候，我也低唱起那支歌來了。</p>
<p>我的病，慢慢變得好起來了。</p>
<p>可是，有一天，村裏突地發生了一件大悲劇：五十多艘出海漁船祗回來了四五艘，其餘，深深埋葬到括起大風浪大海裏去了。村裏被籠罩上無可補償的大悲哀。從人們臉上，從孩子們嘴角邊，極罕找得出那絲微笑了。——詩一樣沉醉人們幽思的歌聲也不再嚮起來了。</p>
<p>親戚們不曾感動在這陣哀氛裏，他們仍然過着一樣的生活。然而，在我，我的心顫動起來了，吹來的海風使我頭痛，深夜裏婆娑着的葉浪使我彷彿又聽到那支歌聲，我又失眠起來了。我的心落在村人們心裏。……</p>
<p>幾天以後我寫信給父親，把我的悲哀寫在每一個字上——於是，在一天早晨，我悄悄地離開了芝拉扎，帶着一顆悲哀的心回到了巴達維亞州府。</p>
<h3>凍瘡特效藥</h3>

<h3>新客衙</h3>
<p>— 柳明</p>
<p>我們　這苦難的，沒有受到祖國的庇護的一羣，現在被趕進這臨時的監獄來了。許多人呌這地方作「新客衙」。</p>
<p>這是一座相當偉大的建築，四面是水門汀的厚厚的牆壁，嵌着鐵條排成的方窓。現在我們完全跟外界隔絕了，剛才在最後的一個同伴進來之後，鐵門便立刻關上下鎖了。</p>
<p>孩子們同婦人們的哭聲漸漸低弱下來了。有許多人坐在潮濕的地面上，用着逃荒者一樣的神色凝視着每個同伴，一個老婦人哭着自語着說：</p>
<p>「為什麼把我關進來呢？天啊！」她絕望地搖着雙手。「我又沒有犯什麼罪。為什麽連我這快進棺材的老女人也帶進來呀！你們這些絕種絕孫的！你呌我的仁兒到那裏去找我呀？」</p>
<p>她那沙啞的聲音不斷地響着，說了又停，停了又說，老是拉起衣裙揩她的眼睛，雙手時時搖擺着，像在招呼什麼人一樣，接着她竟用高聲嚷起來：「你們這般勿好死的五路分屍的人呀！我看你關我到什麼日子？關我到什麽日子！你們這些絕子絕孫的人喲！我上世刨了你祖宗的墳，打碎你祖宗的灰金甕」麽？……」</p>
<p>這凄厲的聲音使我們戰抖起來，許多人的意識給這厲聲喚醒了，就全都低聲咀咒起來，整座房子的空間充滿着憤怒的聲音。</p>
<p>然而非在明天早上不能出去的事情已蚤行决定的。我們心裏雖然戚到苦楚同不平，但起伏不定的心緖終於緩緩地平復下來，同時飢餓的感覺也接着抬頭了。</p>
<p>一想到這種非入的待遇，在我們之間，一種憤激的情緒又猛然掀動起來。</p>
<p>一要把我們餓死麼？坐監也有米飯吃的！媽的，我們還算是入麽？」一個靑年人這樣說。接着轉過身來，用着挑戰一樣的態度對我說：</p>
<p>「生作中國人眞觸霉頭！你說坐「馬鬃」的中國人不是老早就卞船去麽！」</p>
<p>靈樞素問</p>
<p>— 劉馨柏醫師　主答</p>
<p>小便量多</p>
<p>第一〇七號，威海衛路三五七弄十二號，會頌賢君問：敝人現在二十九歲，未婚，身體康健，向無其他疾病，亦向未宿娼，惟每於天氣寒冷之時，則感小便頻繁，一决方罷，二三分鐘，又須第二次，速續至四五决之多。如飲湯水後，則更為利害。每决便量頗多。夜間較少，但亦有一二次至三四决。此症狀起於四五年前。請問：（一）是否腎　？（二）醫治之法？（三）同益洋行經理之Cystex是否可服，可靠？</p>

<p>面上酒刺</p>
<p>第一〇八號，辣斐德路瑞華坊二〇〇號，李炎伯君問：鼻頭常常發紅，且起小泡，剔破有膿血，利害時壓之，內微覺痛。面上亦時起小泡，卽俗名「酒刺」者，斑斑點點，此扑彼起，非常討厭·（一）二病原因為何？（二）究屬內病，或只皮膚病？（三）如何治療？搽或喫什麼藥？（四）應吾騐血？</p>
<p>答：（一）前者名薔薇性瘞瘡，（Acne　Rosaceo）後者名單純性瘞瘡。前者之原因頗多，充血，消化器障碍，飲酒，貧血，血管神經異常均能如此。不知閣下自問在此五種原因中有那一種。後者是由皮脂分泌增加而起。（二）皮膚病，但與內病有相當關係。（三）先診斷有何種內病，卽先治療此種內病，單靠擦藥，跡近治標。搽「皮治樂油膏」（Pixrol　Ointment），注射「矯基鈉」（Sod.　Gacodylate）。（四）應騐血决定有無貧血病。</p>
<p>口歪臉斜</p>
<p>第一〇九號，李忠庸君問：敝人從無尋花問柳之事，但上月曾患喉症，經打血淸而愈。因遵醫生之囑，於病後又臥床十數日。起床後因精神煩悶，赴浦東一遊。孰知在船頭感胃風寒，翌日忽然口目歪斜，左臉不能自山動作，口角上牽，閉眼時連嘴同時引上，並且閉眼很費力。故請問：（一）此病何名？（二）若干時間可愈？（三）服何藥？</p>
<p>答：（一）顏面神經麻痺。（二）最少一星期，最多半年，如不治愈，能成終身病。（三）服「安度沃碘」（Endojodin），按摩，電療，溫水罨包（或用「三福消腫膏」（Saulloid）熱敷效力同）。</p>
<p>包皮潰瘍</p>
<p>第一一〇號，丁一心君問：敝人冶遊後包皮內面生一小潰瘍，自知染毒，卽請四馬路某醫師注射九一四二針始癒。自以為全癒，卽不以為意。但前數日忽然全身生許多紅色小點，擬來先生處診治。請先生先告以（一）是否梅毒，是第幾期？（二）梅毒此外應再有何種症狀？（三）何以此病纒綿如此難癒？（四）根治法？（五）不治將如何？</p>
<p>答：（一）第二期梅毒。（二）骨痛，脫髮，淋巴管腫。（三）此症根治頗難。（四）先注射六〇六，每星期一針，連續六針，同時注射『尅爾梅星』（Carbisin）一打，每三日一針。休息二個月，騐血呈陰性者不再注射，但六個月後仍須再檢査一决。如二個月後騐血仍呈陽性者（有毒），須再如上法注射，至呈陰性（無毒）為止。（五）視侵入部位而異：侵腦者為腦梅毒；侵脊髓者為脊髓梅毒；侵肝者為肝梅毒。厥症實多，非一言二語所能盡。</p>
<p>呼吸困難</p>
<p>第一一一號，河南路三馬路口任醒余君問：舍親某君，於民國二十二年冬因疲勞過度竟患慢性心臟病。病發時氣急非常，呼吸困難，不能坐臥，僅能起立行走，因是精神日劣。初延中醫醫治，毫無寸效。後則延西醫×××等醫治，雖打針服藥，而病情並無進步，反愈治愈凶，幾瀕死境。後得友人介紹，往××醫院日醫××處醫治，一决診後，竟能臥倒，其後經診治十餘次，竟巳復原。惟舍親醉心中醫，同時更以××之藥麻辣難服，不願再診於日醫，卽再延中醫×××診治。初時大概也許是病在恢復時期吧，故尙進步。可是再復發時，該中醫也束手無策。再往日醫處就診，一劑卽瘥。不過每每復發，不能斷根。迄今三載，經濟吿匱，所以自去年春間以還，尙屬每月一發。發卽往日人處就診，診後卽瘥。而現今則有時因經濟關係，不去就醫。以是本月竟發三四决，中間曾往××醫院及×××醫師處就診，不過毫無效果。歸納之下，有數點疑問，至祈先生指敎：（一）據日醫云：『該症為慢性心臟病，自肋間而起，以致心臓肥大，呼吸困難。極忌身心過勞，並煙酒肉等。因非長期醫治，迄今已無痊愈辦法』，不知然吾？（二）其他西醫之藥，因何無效，僅日醫之藥，一服卽能平氣？該藥之味甚麻木，服後常嘔吐！『泡立水』器具遇之卽發白，不知何種藥劑？（三）該症刻下服何藥最有效？</p>
<p>答：貴友之病是心臟性喘息，原因極多，或為紋心症，或為心筋炎，或為心力衰弱。至於（一）松井所云，余未診査，當然無從批評是否正確，但旣經伊診查而發是論，當不致錯誤。（二）批評一醫師之學術，不能但憑其某一劑藥之有無效果，此××或對此病有特殊之經騐也。凡類脂肪性藥劑及芳香性藥劑均能使『泡立水』變色，故單憑此點，不能推知是何藥。（二）旣然××之藥有效。以卽委其手診治為妥。實在因所云『經濟吿匱』，則內服『複方樟腦酊』（Tincura.　Campho.　Conpound）及『麻黃素』（Ephedrin　Sulphate　“Star　Brand”）可也。前每服一錢，後者每服一二片。服時加以最大之注意！</p>
<p>兩胃痛疼</p>
<p>第一一二號，王樹之君問：賤內素有月經不調病，自見先生之答某君之信，上有服『當歸兒』語，連服數瓶後已全愈。但賤內同時尙有腹痛病，痛在兩脅，且有一定時間，卽月經後之十三日至十六七日。腹痛時在床打滾，冷汗浸淫。雖曾請醫診治，但類多止痛於一時。故請（一）先生介紹良藥！（二）此痛經多數醫生診査，言人人殊，所謂國醫，更是欺人，連請七位國醫，竟說出七種病名，而服下之藥，竟如石沉大海，並止一時之效亦無之，請問先生，此病到底何名？（三）何故而起？</p>

<p>慢性白濁</p>
<p>第一一四號，福建壽寧縣政府鄭白君問：敝人患白濁已歷四决，有服草藥而愈者，亦有經注封『果能尅淋』（Gonacriudin）而愈者。但此次偶因房事過度，舊疾又復發。不知是否身體過虛，或婦人生殖器不潔，致常染此病。初起時並不十分痛疼，白濁亦無多。以本縣無西藥房，又無醫生注射，故服六七劑本地土草藥。現已漸决而愈，但不能全然斷根，每一日夜仍有濁一二滴洩出，發陽時亦毫不刺痛，與無病無異。長此延期，（一）對生育上有無妨碍。（二）並請介紹良藥（三）果能克淋內服片價格幾何？請一並示知。</p>

<p>答：用『一〇％抑酸醑』（SpiritusAcid　Salicylic）塗擦。</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>我沒有回答。心裏像給什麼悶塞住那樣難過。那位靑年過一下又走到那邊，跟另一些人談論起來。</p>
<p>漸漸地，窓外有一些居住在本地的同鄉人出現了。他們給我們帶來了一些食物同茶水。他們用樂觀的口氣安慰我們：</p>
<p>「同鄉們，耐性子等一等吧！這苦頭我們從前也嘗過的，有什麼法子呢？焦急也沒有用塲，只要到明天淸早就可以出來了。唉，只怨我們中國不强哩！」</p>
<p>在眞摯的安慰之外，我們還接到了二個豆沙麵包同一杯淸茶。同胞們的摯愛眞使我們感動，在祖國時候那種敵視本人的態度，現在完全消滅於無形了。我第一次感到了同胞之愛。</p>
<p>直到毒熟的陽光從東而的牆頭消去之後，巨大的蚊陣便出現了。悶熱得透不過氣來的房子裏，在小孩子的哭聲同大人們的叱聲嘆聲之外，還雜着嗡嗡的蚊子的呌聲，我感到一種無比的煩躁同抑鬱。美麗的故鄉的影子重新現在心頭，在此刻，我才曉得我們的母親大地的可愛了。那裏雖有着飢餓同壓迫，但自由的分量總比這裏多多，我望着天窓外那閃閃的星光，不禁流下淚來。</p>
<p>「假如我們的祖國能保護我們呢？」我心裏憂鬱地這樣想，然而不曉得這希望到什麼時候才實現呢？</p>

<h3>No War in Eastern and Northern Suiyuan; Frontline Heavy Snow Halts Transportation; Enemy Planes Continue Reconnaissance and Bombing; Rumor of Prince Te Being Seriously Ill in Jiabu Temple</h3>
<p>(Zhangjiakou) Prince Te is currently ill in West Sunite Banner. On the 26th, three key figures from a certain party and over ten Mongolian and Han traitors went from Jiabu Temple to the west to visit Prince Te, discuss the issue of Suiyuan, and vigorously urged Prince Te to raise more Mongolian troops for a major counterattack. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to sources, Prince Te is now seriously ill in Jiabu Temple. Several doctors from a certain country took a Huitong Company plane to Zhangbei a few days ago for treatment. Prince Te's family members have also arrived at the temple. Several battalions of Wang Ying's bandit troops between Shangdu and Zhangbei continue to defect. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Most of Suiyuan is currently experiencing heavy snowfall, including the Bailingmiao area. Transportation there has been halted. Except for aircraft activity, the war has had to be temporarily suspended. Yesterday, aircraft from the Chahar side bombed Xinghe in eastern Suiyuan. The Suiyuan government's aircraft did not come out to respond. (27th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A dispatch from Jining reports that seven enemy planes formed a squadron and flew to Pingdiquan for reconnaissance at 8:00 AM on the 27th. After a while, they flew to Xinghe Hongge'ertu at low altitude, circling without dropping bombs. Around 9:00 AM, they flew towards Shangdu. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>A Certain Army Outside the Pass Prepares to Participate</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) A certain military headquarters in Tianjin revealed that Itagaki returned to Changchun on the 28th and immediately convened a meeting of all officers in Manchuria. The Suiyuan war is like a wildfire spreading, and it is difficult to extinguish. It is impossible for the Kwantung Army to avoid participating. It is also heard that a certain army outside the Pass will directly participate in the Suiyuan war, mainly consisting of the 7th Division stationed in Rehe, the 1st Division stationed in Manchuria, and a mixed cavalry brigade. The mobilization will be completed in about ten days, and formal contact will be in mid-December. Currently, air force support is being used to wear down our forces and prevent an attack on Shangdu. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to sources, enemy reinforcements have arrived in Shangdu. The area along the border of Xinghe is still relatively calm, with only enemy planes flying low for reconnaissance. The area near Bailingmiao has been bombed by planes from a certain party for several days. They flew again for reconnaissance on the morning of the 27th and dropped several bombs. Two divisions of puppet troops and one division from a certain army are currently concentrating towards Duolun from Rehe, with a tendency to assist the enemy in invading. (27th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Instigating Prince Te to Call Upon the Leagues and Banners</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The remaining troops of Wang Ying's bandit forces, after repeated defeats in eastern and northern Suiyuan, are less than 4,000 men. They are currently gathering outside Shangdu to reorganize. A certain party believes that the failure of the invasion plan of Suiyuan is not due to unfavorable military supplies, but because the bandit troops lack combat experience and the leaders lack sufficient prestige. Currently, in addition to actively instigating Prince Te to quickly call upon the league and banner troops to make another struggle, it is planned to place the bandit troops in northern Chahar under the command of one person, so as to achieve unity. It is heard that the selection of this person is currently underway. (27th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Quiet Frontline, Outward Slackness but Inner Tensions</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Fu Zuoyi sent a telegram to Nanjing on the 27th, reporting the recapture of Bailingmiao and stating that the front line has been quiet in recent days, but there is outward slackness but inner tensions. A certain party is reorganizing the remaining bandit and puppet troops, while also increasing the deployment of puppet troops from Rehe, concentrating towards Kangbao Shangdu, and is planning something else. Now that the bandit and puppet troops' base in northern Suiyuan has been lost and our army's position in eastern Suiyuan is consolidated, any enemy attacks will be met with a severe blow. (27th Central News Agency Dispatch) A certain party supplied Li Shou-hsin with 20 planes and 30 tanks. Once all the Rehe puppet troops are concentrated, they will join forces with Zhang Wanqing and Jin Jia-san's puppet troops to use Shangdu as a base and launch a major re-invasion of Taolin and Xinghe. (27th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Bandit and Puppet Remnants Form Suicide Squads</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) A dispatch from Jining reports that the puppet Mongolian army in Shangdu is urgently forming suicide squads, commanded by people from a certain country, to counterattack Bailingmiao. Another chemical warfare team is being formed to launch an assault with poison gas weapons, aiming to recapture the area in the coming days. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) A reporter visited Chen Cheng, the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in the Border Area of the Four Provinces of Jin, Shaanxi, Suiyuan, and Ningxia, on the morning of the 27th. According to him, the puppet bandits' invasion of Suiyuan is a problem of China as a whole. The central government attaches great importance to it and has dispatched a large army to strike a heavy blow and thoroughly clear it. The troops are concentrating towards their destinations. He will soon go to Suiyuan for inspection. Chen Cheng left for Suiyuan at 2:00 PM accompanied by Fan Songfu, Liu Huiyang, Li Zefen, and others. (27th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Chen Cheng flew to Suiyuan this morning accompanied by Army Commander Fan Songfu and Chief of Staff Liu Yaoyang. Not long after departure, they returned due to poor weather and switched to automobiles in the afternoon. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) Zhao Chengshou came to Suiyuan from Jining on the morning of the 26th to discuss bandit suppression matters with Fu Zuoyi. Zhang Xueliang sent representative Miao Boran from Shaanxi to Suiyuan on the 26th to meet with Fu for discussions. Representatives of the Northeastern People's Salvation Association, Che Qinghe and two others, came with Miao to comfort the troops. On the 26th, four planes from a certain party came to conduct reconnaissance over Taolin and Jining. There are currently no traces of bandits within Suiyuan. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Enemy and Puppet Military Strength Divided into Three Major Groups</p>
<p>(Beiping) A person from Pingdiquan said that after Bailingmiao was captured by our army, there have been changes in the enemy and puppet forces' strength and preparations for an attack. According to reports, the enemy and puppet forces are divided into three groups. Li Shou-hsin's troops are concentrated in Zhangbei, totaling more than 5,000 men. Wang Ying's remaining troops in Shangdu also number 5,000 men. Prince Te has collected no more than 5,000 of the remnants of the First Army who withdrew from Bailingmiao. A certain party has special forces between Duolun and Zhangbei, including two squadrons of aircraft and a regiment of artillery with many heavy artillery pieces, as well as a team of armored vehicles and a team of tanks. There are two infantry regiments gathered in Duolun. Between Fengning and Dage in Rehe, there are two divisions of puppet troops under Zhang Hai-peng and Li Hai-qing. Most of a certain party's army is still in Chengde. The puppet troops in Shangdu and Zhangbei are still reorganizing and replenishing. Due to the heavy snow and severe cold in Inner Mongolia, it is not yet known whether they will have the ability to counterattack Bailingmiao in the short term. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Our Troops Fought Bravely in the Battle of Bailingmiao</p>
<p>(Guihua) In the battle of Bailingmiao on the evening of the 23rd, the bandit army resisted stubbornly. Zhang Zhenji's company of the National Army bravely advanced towards the bandits, disregarding their own safety. The entire company suffered heavy casualties. According to official reports, in the battles of Hongge'ertu, Bailingmiao, and Xinghe, the cavalry of Zhao Chengshou's troops, the infantry of Li Fuying's troops, the replenishment regiment of Wang Jingguo's troops, and the Dong and Sun brigades, along with the security teams of Taolin and Xinghe, fought bravely to suppress the bandits and defeat them. All units not only fully achieved the instructed objectives, but also completed their tasks at any time, which is commendable. (27th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Zhangjiakou) Due to Bailingmiao being captured by the National Army, the various bandit, puppet, and Mongolian troops invading northern Suiyuan fled, with some escaping to the grasslands behind northern Suiyuan, most retreating to Shangdu and Jiabu Temple, and another cavalry unit fleeing to Pangjiang and Erlian areas under the West Sunite Banner. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Zhangjiakou) There are currently three divisions of Rehe troops and 3,000 bandit troops in the trenches and Daqinggou in southeastern Suiyuan. Zhang Wanqing's rebel forces have been constantly attacking westward from Nanhaogou in recent days, but without success. Ten planes flew to eastern Suiyuan for reconnaissance on the morning of the 26th. There are currently over a thousand Rehe troops stationed in Guyuan. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Wang Jingguo Arrives in Suiyuan; Sizi Banner is Pacified</p>
<p>(Guihua) Wang Jingguo came to Suiyuan at noon on the 27th. Fu, Zhao, and Wang will meet Chen Cheng to discuss military affairs. The puppet Mongolian army collapsed from the temple on the night of the 24th and the morning of the 25th. When passing through Sizi Banner, they were intercepted by Pan Wang's troops, who killed countless bandits and captured some. On the night of the 26th, Pan Wang sent a representative to Suiyuan to meet with Fu Zuoyi to report on the situation. Sizi Banner is currently pacified. (27th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) At 4:00 PM on the 27th, German Ambassador Trautmann visited Foreign Minister Zhang at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to explain the nature of the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact, which has already been announced.

According to Pan Wang's report, when the bandit and puppet troops suffered a crushing defeat at Bailingmiao, they originally planned to escape via the road to Damao Temple, as it was more convenient. However, fearing that the National Army was stationed at Damao Temple, they changed their route and fled from the mountains behind Bailingmiao to the northern wilderness of Inner Mongolia. The mountains behind were covered with thick snow, and the bandits were extremely miserable when they fled.

After the Legislative Yuan ordered the Commercial Law Committee to review and report, the committee reviewed the matter and held that the issue of utilizing foreign capital is complex and should be subject to separate regulations for compliance. It submitted a reply to the sixth meeting of the third session of the Legislative Yuan, which resolved to return the matter to the committee to draft separate regulations for further deliberation. The committee repeatedly convened meetings and jointly discussed the matter, unanimously holding that the current Company Law and Company Law Enforcement Regulations do not have express provisions for the restrictions on Chinese-foreign joint ventures. How should the central resolution be followed now, and restrictions be expressly provided for by law? After the law is implemented, what should be done with companies established before the law, which do not comply with the legal restrictions? How should a deadline for rectification be set? All these aspects must depend on the actual administrative situation, and it is truly the competent authority that can fully understand the current situation, examine the advantages and disadvantages, and stipulate appropriately. Therefore, it was unanimously proposed that the Executive Yuan order the Ministry of Industry to first formulate separate regulations and then consult the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. The Commercial Law Committee's opinion was submitted to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation at its meeting on the 27th, and the result was that everyone advocated that there was no need to formulate separate regulations.

<h3>Review of the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>After the news of the establishment of the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact was released, international public opinion was in an uproar. There has been much discussion among the world's commentators regarding the reasons for concluding the pact and its gains and losses. Now, from China's standpoint, we will briefly review the content of the published pact.</p>
<p>First, opposing communism is merely a matter of ideology. Leftist thought within Japan has become muted in recent years due to strict suppression. And in Germany, since Hitler came to power, the Communist Party has had virtually no room for activity. Even if Japan and Germany were to further intensify their anti-communism domestically, this would only be a matter of each country's internal affairs and cannot be the reason for concluding this international agreement. The intention of the two signatory countries is clearly to use their combined strength to gain some advantages from third countries. The preamble to the pact contains the following sentences: "If the interference of the Comintern in the domestic affairs of various countries (not specifically referring to Japan and Germany) is tolerated, then it is not only the tranquility and social welfare of the respective countries that will be in grave danger, but world peace will also inevitably be threatened." This suggests that Japan and Germany intend to interfere in the internal affairs of third countries in the name of anti-communism.</p>
<p>Second, looking at Article 2 of the pact, Japan and Germany will jointly exert appropriate pressure on countries they consider "threatened by the Comintern" to make them join the anti-communist group. The Japanese Foreign Ministry's statement also placed special emphasis on China, stating, "The progress of redification is particularly severe in China in the Far East. The communist forces in mainland China are rampant." We have no objection to Japan seeking countermeasures to prevent the threat of the Comintern. However, the Red Peril in China has long been at the end of its rope and is by no means as serious as the Japanese Foreign Ministry claims. Even if the Communist Party is still resisting in China, China's own strength is more than sufficient to cope with it. Why should the Japanese be overly concerned on our behalf? This statement by Japan not only disregards China's sovereignty but is simply for other purposes.</p>
<p>Third, regarding the nature of the pact, although there are no explicit military alliance clauses in the publicly released content, Article 1 of the pact stipulates that cooperative defense strategies must be adopted against the activities of the Comintern, and the protocol also stipulates the establishment of a standing committee to handle this cooperative defense matter. The implication of military cooperation is already strong enough.</p>
<p>The above is based on the publicly released portion of the pact. As for the secret clauses reported by the London Evening Standard, if they were to become a reality, Germany would abandon its claim to recover its old islands in the Pacific and open the door for Japan's southward policy. As a result, the promotion of Japan's continental policy would undoubtedly become even more uninhibited, and China's position would inevitably become more difficult. However, judging from the current international situation in the Far East, this is probably just a Japanese fantasy.</p>

<h3>### Rumors Abound in Tokyo: Italy and Japan Reach a Compromise; Japan Prepares to Recognize Italian Annexation of Abyssinia in Exchange for Italian Recognition of the Puppet State</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to semi-official sources today, Japan and Italy have reached a compromise. Japan will recognize Italy's rule over Abyssinia, and Italy will recognize "Manchukuo" and Japanese commercial rights in Abyssinia. The resolution to change the Japanese embassy in the Abyssinian capital to a Japanese consulate has been submitted to the Cabinet for approval. It is also learned that Japan currently does not want to enlist Italy to join the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact because Italy's relations with Britain and Russia are particularly complex and inconvenient to join at present. (December 27th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) This morning, a spokesperson for the Japanese Foreign Ministry, in answering questions from foreign journalists, confirmed the news that Japan and Italy would conclude an important agreement, stating that the nature of the agreement was different from the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact and would be signed and announced soon. When asked whether it involved exchanging recognition of Abyssinia and "Manchukuo," he replied that it was too early to say at present, but negotiations were in the initial stages of completion. The spokesperson also said that Japan had not yet considered the issue of asking Germany to jointly invite China to join the Anti-Comintern Pact and had not yet planned for it. The spokesperson did not express disagreement with Germany's explanation that the agreement had no geographical restrictions, saying that although Japan could not extend its jurisdiction to other countries, the agreement could apply even if communist activity was far away. Japan and Germany will soon begin negotiations on the standing committee. It is heard that Japanese Foreign Minister Arita is quite unhappy that Soviet Ambassador to Japan Yurenev violated the confidentiality of the talks he had with the ambassador on November 16th and 19th regarding the German-Japanese agreement. At the same time, the Foreign Ministry spokesperson also confirmed that there were quite a few people who criticized Arita for not having previously disclosed the news of the German-Japanese agreement to the Soviet Union.

<h3>### Moscow Newspaper's Observation of the Objectives of the German-Japanese Agreement</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Regarding the German-Japanese alliance and the Anti-Comintern, the "Izvestia" commented today, "The purpose of the Berlin agreement is none other than to conceal the secret military agreement of the aggressor countries. The signing of the alliance is not only aimed at the Soviet Union, but other countries must also be taken into account. Each participating country intends to use it to complete its respective strategies of aggression and conquest. The Japanese side sees it as the only tool for establishing hegemony in East Asia and the Pacific, while Germany sees it as the only magic weapon for conquering Europe and the Near East. All of these are the true objectives of the German-Japanese alliance, which are disguised with the theory of 'ideology.'"</p>
<p>The "Pravda" commented, "The four governments will now also deny ever signing any secret agreements with Germany to fool the people of their countries, but they will certainly not succeed. All reliable information provided by the Soviet government can be proven with documents. On this point, the Japanese government must have already experienced this. From this, we can draw another conclusion, namely, that we must continue to work hard, strive for peace and collective security, and continue to attack the warmongers and their evil firearms." (December 26th TASS)</p>
<h3>### Poland Refuses to Participate in the German-Japanese Agreement; Cold Attitudes from Various Countries; Great Disappointment in Berlin</h3>
<p>Warsaw The German Ambassador to Poland, Moltke, visited General Ryz-Smigly, the Chief Inspector of the Armed Forces, yesterday afternoon. Well-informed sources claim that Ambassador Moltke's move had three purposes: (1) To congratulate Ryz-Smigly on his recent promotion to General; (2) To invite Poland to join the German-Japanese "Anti-Comintern Pact"; (3) To advocate that Poland should follow Germany and Italy in recognizing the Spanish Nationalist government. Political figures also stated that General Ryz-Smigly immediately and clearly rejected the second and third requests. (December 27th Havas)</p>
<p>Warsaw According to well-informed sources, the German Ambassador to Poland, Moltke, recently visited Foreign Minister Beck to explain the German-Japanese "Anti-Comintern" Pact, which was still under consideration at the time, and to negotiate Poland's participation in the "Anti-Comintern" Pact. However, it is heard that Poland does not intend to participate in this agreement. (December 26th Havas)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Berlin is particularly disappointed that Britain and other countries have responded coldly to the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact. The mouthpiece of the Foreign Ministry, the "Foreign Political Correspondence," declared that the agreement was limited to curbing the spread of Bolshevism and was very clear. They said that the agreement was a smokescreen for imperialism and contained a will to threaten with self-respect, etc., but Wu Zheng said that these were all transferred statements. (December 26th Reuters)</p>
<h3>### Eastern Newspaper Commentary: Intellectual Circles Express Anxiety</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Apart from newspaper commentaries, there are very few individuals in the Japanese public who have expressed their opinions on the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact. The Asahi Shimbun published another commentary today, urging the public to pay attention to the fascization of Japanese domestic politics, which can reflect a glimpse of the anxiety of Japanese intellectuals. The main points of the Asahi editorial are roughly as follows: Japan and Germany have found common ground in maintaining national individuality and defending against the progress of reactionary ideas, so the current agreement has been concluded. However, the paths to achieve the above-mentioned goals are indeed different for the two countries. The two countries should strictly maintain their respective individualities and vigorously guard against assimilation. Since the purpose of anti-communism is to maintain their respective national individualities, it is illogical to mix and assimilate the individualities of Japan and Germany. Germany's current political plan is adapted to the country's special needs, so apart from the common interests regarding anti-communism, Japan, in terms of domestic guiding principles, certainly does not want to take the same steps as Germany.

<h3>### British and French Apprehension</h3>
<p>(London) After the establishment of the German-Japanese "Anti-Comintern Pact," very few government newspapers here have criticized it. The opposition Liberal Party newspapers, namely the "Manchester Guardian" and the "News Chronicle," stated that the reaction in Britain to the agreement was extremely negative. The "Manchester Guardian" also stated that Japanese public opinion had not expressed satisfaction, saying, "This agreement has caused a bad impression here. The actions of the German Ambassador to Britain, Ribbentrop, are seen by the British as nothing more than a propaganda effort and are inconsistent with the status of an ambassador of a major power. Any sympathy that could have been hoped for in Britain will inevitably be lost completely." The "News Chronicle" stated, "The German government originally wanted to guide Britain to give some support to this Anti-Comintern Pact, but its misunderstanding of the British people's psychology is extreme." (December 27th Havas)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the establishment of the German-Japanese "Anti-Comintern Pact," all newspapers here, regardless of their affiliation, stated that the reaction in most countries, especially Britain, was extremely negative. The moderate "Le Journal" stated, "Britain should immediately rise up to counter Japan." The right-wing "L'Écho de Paris" stated, "The German Ambassador to Britain, Ribbentrop, expressed opposition to this agreement, but then went back on his word and signed it, which has caused great dissatisfaction in London, and the ambassador's mission will inevitably face difficulties." The radical socialist "L'Ère Nouvelle" stated, "Germany has been in contact with the countries of Central Europe and the Balkans, asking them to join this agreement, but has not been able to do so, especially the Austrian government, which has met it with a cold attitude." The Communist Party's organ, "L'Humanité," stated, "France should not always remain in a passive position. All countries that cherish the maintenance of peace should not ignore this alliance treaty between Germany and Japan." In addition, the right-wing "Le Matin" alone expressed support, saying, "The anti-communist struggle has been led by Germany and Japan, and other countries have no choice but to cooperate."

<h3>### Mediterranean Issue: Britain and Italy Negotiate Gentleman's Agreement; Italy Does Not Participate in German-Japanese Agreement for Fear of Affecting Current Negotiations</h3>
<p>(Paris) Semi-official sources recently stated that Italy will not join the "Anti-Comintern Pact" established by Germany and Japan. The gentleman's agreement to be established between Britain and Italy on the Mediterranean issue has begun negotiations in London. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is deeply concerned that Italy's joining the "Anti-Comintern Pact" would hinder these negotiations. As for the relations between Italy and Germany, the Italian government believes that Foreign Minister Ciano had fully explained the irreconcilable situation between fascism and communism during his previous talks in Berlin. (December 27th Havas)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the matter of Britain and Italy establishing a gentleman's agreement on the Mediterranean issue, political figures recently expressed their opinions that the British and Italian governments do not want to hastily proceed with negotiations. The British and Italian governments have agreed in principle on several levels regarding the separate issuance of declarations, mutual recognition of spheres of influence in the Mediterranean, guaranteeing mutual rights within each sphere of influence, and agreeing to hold consultations with each other in the event of disputes. If the environment is favorable in the future, then this gentleman's agreement can be concluded based on the above principles, but there is no need to rush to do so at present. Political figures also believe that Italy should avoid taking any action that would hinder the cooperation between Britain and Italy on the Spanish issue and the establishment of an anti-communist front. In addition, the British government's previous proposal to delineate a neutral zone near the port of Barcelona to allow free passage for ships of various countries has been accepted by General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the Spanish Nationalist forces. It is generally believed that this is the result of persuasion from the Italian side. (December 26th Havas)</p>
<h3>### European "King of Armaments" Zaharoff Dies of Illness; British National Made a Fortune Selling Arms; A Life of Mystery and Known as a Remarkable Person</h3>
<p>Monte Carlo Sir Basil Zaharoff, a British financier, died here today at the age of eighty-six. Zaharoff was the "King of Armaments" of Europe, and his words could often influence the fate of nations. From his youth to the height of his power, there were many extraordinary deeds, hence the name "Remarkable Person." Monarchs and politicians of various countries feared and respected him. There are conflicting accounts of Zaharoff's origins. What is certain is that he was born in 1850, the son of a Zaharoff in Paris. When Lloyd George was Prime Minister during the European War, because Zaharoff was in fact the mastermind behind the supply of munitions to the Allied forces, he wanted to know his background and ordered a secret detective to investigate. It was then learned that Zaharoff was born in Constantinople, his father was Russian, and his mother was Greek. Zaharoff came to England to study at his father's behest. In addition to English, he was also proficient in French, Spanish, Italian, and Arabic. When his father died, he left an inheritance of 40,000 pounds. Zaharoff spent most of this money on gambling not long after leaving school. He then disappeared for several years. It is said that he worked in the press in New York and other American cities, but almost no one knows the details of his early years. Zaharoff's involvement in international affairs began with the supply of munitions to the Egyptian army and the Upper Nile. He then became the manager of the Vickers Company, a British arms manufacturer, in Athens, and gained power in Greek politics. During the Balkan Wars, he donated hundreds of thousands of pounds in money to support Greece's war effort. Before long, he was respected by the whole of Europe. Zaharoff was very successful in selling large quantities of guns and cannons in the Near East. He then changed his position to Russian manager of Vickers Company and settled in Paris. Zaharoff was a major shareholder in important shipyards. During the Russo-Japanese War, he sold a large number of ships to Russia, which is said to have made a huge profit. By the time the European War broke out, Zaharoff had become one of the most powerful and wealthiest people in Europe. The transactions between Vickers Company and the Allied countries reached tens of millions of pounds, most of which were handled by Zaharoff. Zaharoff initially invested heavily in the Dutch Oil Company and then engaged in various industries around the world, all of which were successful. Zaharoff once said, "Everyone knows that I am successful in everything I do, so every time I start a business, they invite me to invest first, so I am known to the world as a lucky person. In fact, since 1900, I have not tried to increase my assets." Zaharoff was generous and charitable, and the poor people of Paris benefited greatly. He donated huge sums of money to establish aviation scholarships at universities in Paris, Leningrad, and London, and established a French literature chair at Oxford University and an English literature chair at the University of Paris. Zaharoff was not only engaged in the arms industry, but was also a trusted political adviser. Initially, he was a confidant messenger between Briand and Lloyd George, and later between Lloyd George and Clemenceau. It is for this reason that he bears the name of a remarkable person. Zaharoff often traveled between London and Paris at night, handling matters with calmness. The most famous romantic story of Zaharoff's life began inside the Madrid Royal Palace in the 19th century. One day, Zaharoff was walking down the stairs in the palace when he suddenly saw a young nobleman grabbing a noblewoman and insulting her. He was angry at his rudeness and stepped forward to intervene. It was only afterward that he learned that the young nobleman was Prince Paul Bourbon, a cousin of the Spanish King, and the noblewoman was his wife, the Duchess of Marchena, who was just twenty years old. As a result, Zaharoff and the Duchess became fond of each other and had close contact. Prince Paul Bourbon, due to mental confusion, was confined by his family in a country villa and did not pass away until 1924. In that year, Zaharoff married the Duchess and lived together in Paris, Nice, and Monte Carlo. However, eighteen months later, the Duchess fell ill and died. He mourned her greatly, and from then on, he no longer went out and engaged in activities. Only in one year, when a British woman named Lady Woven was sentenced to five years in prison, she begged Zaharoff for help. After repeatedly declining, he devised a way to campaign for her and finally got her declared innocent. Zaharoff had many residences, and his villa in Balincourt, which originally belonged to King Leopold I of Belgium, was extremely famous in France for its magnificent architecture. The treasures he had collected for forty years were all displayed in it. Behind the villa was a small lake where he often enjoyed boating in his spare time. Zaharoff moved to Monte Carlo every winter, but for thirty years, he never set foot in the gambling venues there. When he was eighty years old, it was rumored that his total assets were worth about 20 million pounds, making him the richest person in Europe. His life was full of mysteries, and the burning of his diaries in his later years made his life's deeds forever buried in their true form. Zaharoff often had various habits that were quite superstitious, such as using the paper band of a cigar as a symbol of good luck. In 1927, the British Vickers Company presented him with a silver cup to commemorate his 50th year of joining the company. Although Zaharoff was a mysterious figure in the international financial world, he often talked to the elderly and children in the village about farming in the countryside, and his approachable attitude was highly praised by the villagers. Although Zaharoff has now passed away, his mysterious life remains unknowable. Some say that he no longer participated in the world of finance in recent years, while others say that he always used his great influence to manipulate it in secret. But in the end, it is feared that few people in the world know the details. (December 27th Reuters)</p>

<h3>### Greatest Enemies of Austria: Communism and National Socialism</h3>
<p>(Vienna) The Patriotic Front held a rally in Klagenfurt yesterday afternoon, where Chancellor Schuschnigg gave a speech explaining Austria's stance on the "Anti-Communist Crusade," stating that Austria currently has three major enemies: (1) Communism, (2) National Socialism, (3) Self-destructive "failure" righteousness. "Among the three, communism is the most serious. Although we do not overestimate its danger to Austria and it has not yet become acute, we also know that it is the most dangerous thing in modern times and must be closely monitored. As for National Socialism within Germany, it has nothing to do with us. However, Austrian National Socialism is our second major enemy. The Austrian government's policy of anti-National Socialism is based on the legacy of the late Chancellor Dollfuss and is a matter of internal affairs, which does not affect the cooperation between Germany and Austria." Finally, Schuschnigg said that the duty of the government is to do its best within the scope of the Patriotic Front to fight against communism and National Socialism. Political figures recently commented on this speech, saying that the world may blame Austria for only focusing on preventing communism, so the Chancellor compared communism and National Socialism and defended it.

<h3>### Romanian Foreign Minister Visits Warsaw; Hungary Uneasy</h3>
<p>Warsaw Romanian Foreign Minister Antonescu, who came to return the visit, arrived here this morning and immediately paid his respects to President Mościcki. He also visited General Ryz-Smigly, the Chief Inspector of the Armed Forces, Prime Minister Sławoj Składkowski, and Foreign Minister Colonel Beck. (December 26th Havas)</p>
<p>Budapest Responsible Hungarian figures are uneasy about the recent trip of the Romanian Foreign Minister to Poland, fearing that as a result of this trip, Poland will follow Germany and Austria in taking a reserved attitude towards Hungary (i.e., not supporting Hungary's claims to revise the treaties).</p>
<h3>Soviet Congress Closes; Cossack Regiment Declaration: Vowing to Destroy Enemies for the Motherland; All Russian People Praise the New Constitution; Resolved to Continue the Struggle Against Fascism</h3>
<p>(Moscow) At the closing of the All-Union Congress today, the Cossack Regiment declared: "The Red Cossacks will not show any mercy to the Japanese, Germans, or other enemies who dare to attack the Cossack Motherland, and will fiercely strike them down!" Upon hearing this, all the representatives in the congress, including Stalin, Defense Commissar Voroshilov, and members of the Politburo, stood up and cheered enthusiastically in response. The Cossack representatives, dressed in military uniforms that had been banned in previous years, raised their swords and shouted. The light of the swords was dazzling. Their spokesperson further said, "We are prepared to come out again to assist and sweep away the fascist armies at any time." It is said that the Cossacks, being the most elite division in the Red Army, plan to destroy the enemy and assist the working class with all their strength. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) On November 26, representatives participating in the discussion of Stalin's report included personnel from various republics, regions, provinces, Stakhanovites, and collective farmers. In addition, the chairmen of the People's Committees of Ukraine, Crimea, and Kazakhstan, and the chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR), Shalimov, also participated in the discussion. They unanimously praised Stalin's new constitution and discussed the economic and political achievements of various parts of the Soviet Union. Workers and collective farmers in Moscow and Cossack people also told each other about their happy lives and their enthusiasm for praising their leader, and unanimously expressed their willingness to sacrifice everything to defend the country. (TASS, 27th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Yesterday, all the people of the Soviet Union listened respectfully to Stalin's report on the constitution at the Congress of Soviets. The report was also broadcast on the radio. Millions of workers, collective farmers, and office workers listened to the report outside the venue. They were extremely moved by the words stating the author of the constitution and the victory of socialism, and this aroused great faith in everyone for the socialist motherland.</p>
<p>The entire workforce of the Moscow Electric Power Union sent congratulations, stating, "Regarding the Soviet working masses, the new constitution is completed through tremendous struggle. The new constitution is an indictment against fascism and also a banner of war for the evolved human race against fascist barbarism. This new constitution can give the Soviet people a great determination to strive for the motherland," and so on. (TASS, 26th)</p>
<h3>Ukrainian State Chairman's Speech: Resist the Fascist Bloc, Willing to Serve at the Forefront of National Defense</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Chairman of the People's Committee of the Ukrainian Republic, Lyubchenko, first spoke of the suffering of Ukraine being occupied by Germany and wanting to turn it into a Polish colony. He continued, "It was not until under the Soviet government that Ukraine became independent and free, and today coming to this congress, Ukraine has become a strong country and an indivisible part of the Soviet Union."</p>
<p>Lyubchenko stated Stalin's special role in the national, economic, and cultural development of Ukraine and used many figures to demonstrate the country's great economic and political success, refuting the false news in fascist newspapers about the famine in Ukraine. Lyubchenko pointed out the recent intensification of anti-Soviet activities by fascist countries led by Germany, and continued, "Under the guise of anti-communism, fascist countries are madly attempting to form a bloc of the most reactionary countries to launch new attacks against the Soviet Union. Berlin and Rome have launched a mad anti-Soviet propaganda campaign. German fascism has concluded a joint anti-communist agreement with Japanese imperialism, which is actually a military agreement."</p>
<p>Lyubchenko went on to explain that in the atmosphere of these fascist countries concluding agreements, Polish diplomacy is following the path of German fascism. He said, "In the plans of the fascist bloc, Soviet Ukraine and Ukraine's secession from the Soviet Union occupy a special position. The people of Ukraine have already given their support." He also said that although Engaresco's visit was intended to persuade the Polish authorities in the hope of improving relations between Poland and Czechoslovakia, Poland may not be close to Czechoslovakia. (Havas, 27th) All the people of the Soviet Union are jointly creating a strong and invincible nail army. Fascist rulers must remember that their fanning of the flames of world war will first burn themselves. The fascists are drunk with their crazy arms expansion, drunk with their success in turning Germany into a food-deficient military camp, and are fantasizing that they can easily invade the land of Soviet Ukraine from Berlin and East Prussia, just like invading the Rhineland.</p>
<p>Lyubchenko then concluded his speech amidst a tidal wave of applause, saying, "Without a doubt, the Red Army, under the leadership of Marshal Voroshilov, will give the Fascists an unprecedented and devastating blow, and the Ukrainian people will be at the forefront of the Soviet Union's defense!" (TASS, 27th)</p>
<h3>British Ships Redeployed in Spanish Waters: Intended to Protect Shipping</h3>
<p>Malta: The cruiser "Galatea" and nine destroyers sailed to Palma today, replacing the cruiser "Arethusa" and nine destroyers in Spanish waters. The Admiralty stated that this replacement was purely routine, but well-informed sources believe that this is related to Foreign Secretary Eden's protection of British ships from being blockaded by the Spanish rebels.

<h3>200,000 Residents Evacuate Madrid: Thousands of Vehicles Constantly on the Road; Government Troops Win Counterattack in the Southern Suburbs of the Capital</h3>
<p>Madrid: Today, the authorities prepared 239 trains, 25,674 cars, and 2,566 buses to transport 200,000 non-combatants residing in the city of Madrid out of the city. The U.S. Chargé d'Affaires in Spain, Wendelin, and personnel from the U.S. Embassy also left the capital. This time, a total of 2 million liters of gasoline and 795 tons of coal were used. At a time when large numbers of non-combatants were constantly leaving, the military authorities claimed that the government army launched a major offensive in the Aranjuez area, with the aim of trapping the rebel army on the left bank of the Tagus River, and seizing the opportunity to attack the right wing of the rebel army surrounding Madrid, which has been victorious. It is said that the government army has occupied two villages and is now planning to attack Toledo and Talavera. The news of the victory greatly boosted the morale of the Madrid garrison. The garrison is also attacking the Basques on the Biscay front to disperse the rebel army's forces surrounding Madrid. At the same time, according to official announcements, government aircraft have resumed their air raid activities. Today, a squadron of rebel fighters over Madrid was repelled. It was also stated that the rebel army began a fierce attack on the Manzanares area today but was also repelled by the government army, losing several tanks. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>Lisbon: According to a special correspondent for the Lisbon Daily News, there have been significant developments in the situation in Madrid. The correspondent received reliable news that the Nationalist Army's General Staff has decided to abandon the forward positions in Madrid and devote all its efforts to cutting off traffic on all sides of the capital. The most important thing at present is the Madrid-Valencia road. At the same time, the government army has controlled all the strategic locations and defended all entrances to Madrid with 2,000 heavy machine guns. The Nationalist Army in the University City area has become an isolated army, cut off from supplies and lacking food and water. What is taken from the Manzanares River is far from enough, but they are determined to defend to the death, enduring constant artillery fire. Yesterday, twelve government fighters flew over their lines all day long, strafing downwards with machine guns. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<h3>Italy Denies Coveting Spanish Islands</h3>
<p>(Rome) Officials here have firmly denied rumors that Italy covets Spain's Balearic Islands (located in the western Mediterranean, a major thoroughfare for traffic between France and North Africa), and said that Prime Minister Mussolini himself has repeatedly denied this claim. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) Lord Faringdon mentioned during a debate on Spanish affairs in the House of Lords today that various newspapers had published news saying that Italy had occupied the Spanish island of Majorca. According to him, Italy may have engaged in slaughter and organized all the defenses of the National Army on Majorca. British Foreign Secretary the Earl of Plymouth replied that all parties have stated that Italy intends to occupy a part of the Balearic Islands, and this may be an exchange condition agreed with Nationalist General Franco, but in recent months, the Italian government has repeatedly assured Britain that it has no intention of encroaching on the islands in any way. The Italian government leader recently met with a British reporter and made a clear statement on the above intentions. We can naturally regard this as a formal guarantee. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<h3>Italian and German Aid Troops: French Newspaper Reports Confidently</h3>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the matter of Italy and Germany aiding the Spanish Nationalist Army, the socialist party's newspaper "Le Populaire" has recently learned from well-informed sources that 30 Italian fighter planes and 20 bombers are scheduled to fly to the Spanish Balearic Islands in the western Mediterranean (now in the hands of the Nationalist Army) on the 28th of this month, and on the morning of the 30th, they will fly from there to the Spanish port of Barcelona to begin bombing. Mrs. Taboui, a foreign affairs reporter for "Le Populaire", said that German leader Adolf Hitler has decided to send troops to the Spanish territory of Morocco, ordering them to change into Spanish regular army uniforms, and then head to the Spanish mainland to join the Nationalist Army in combat.

<h3>Barcelona Port: Safe Zone Demarcated; Rebels Accept British Request</h3>
<p>(London) The Spanish Nationalist Army government had previously notified all countries that it intended to blockade the port of Barcelona. The British government ordered its ambassador to Spain, Sir Chilton (currently in Hendaye, southern France), to negotiate with the Nationalist Army authorities to demarcate a safe zone near the port of Barcelona. This request has been accepted by the Nationalist Army authorities. Recently, the Admiralty issued a bulletin stating that, according to a report from the commander of the Third British Cruiser Squadron (stationed in Palma, Majorca), "The commander of the Nationalist Army garrison on Spanish Majorca has issued a notice stating that the Nationalist Army General Staff has designated a safe zone for ships of neutral countries near the port of Barcelona. This zone extends from 41 degrees 20 minutes north latitude to 41 degrees north latitude, including the port of Barcelona and a three-mile zone of territorial waters outside the port." It is reported that the garrison commander of Majorca has also issued the same notice to Italian and French ships in the port of Palma. (Havas, 26th)</p>

<h3>Albania Recognizes Rebel Government</h3>
<p>Albanian Capital: The Albanian government has recently recognized the Nationalist Army government in the city of Burgos as the legitimate government of Spain. According to a government communiqué, the power of the Nationalist Army government has already spread to most of Spain's territory, and there is no government in other parts of the territory that can effectively exercise power. In addition, the Albanian government has always held an opposing policy towards communism. All of these are reasons for recognizing the Nationalist Army government. (Havas, 26th)</p>

<p>Naples: After the King and Hungarian Regent Admiral Horthy held a grand review of the Italian Navy here this morning, they held a banquet at noon on the flagship "Zara" to entertain Admiral Horthy. After the banquet, Horthy delivered a speech on the spot, recalling that during the World War, the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Italy had met in battle, but after the war, there was no resentment between Austria-Hungary and Italy. The old enmity has now become an alliance. The Regent then thanked Italy for its grand reception and praised the strength of the Italian Navy, saying that the Italian fleet has now become one of the largest navies in the world, with strict discipline and the strength to win. It will surely promote Italian power in the future." To this, the King rose to thank and said, "I am indescribably grateful for hearing Admiral Horthy's honorable and powerful words. The friendship between Italy and Hungary will only increase, and the Adriatic Sea is a chain of friendship between the two countries." (Havas, 26th)</p>

<h3>Quanzhou: Advocating the Repair of the Tombs of National Heroes, Yu Dayou and Zheng Chenggong, Whose Achievements are Outstanding; Repairing the Two Tombs While Building a Pagoda for Commemoration</h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Qin Wangshan from Quanzhou believes that the Ming Dynasty national heroes Yu Dayou and Zheng Chenggong have outstanding achievements and are admired by the people. It is learned that Yu's tomb is in Jinjiang and Zheng's tomb is in Nan'an, and they have been in disrepair for many years and have been looted. He specially sent a letter to Chairman Lin of the National Government, and Chairman Chen Yi of Fujian Province, Party Affairs Commissioner Chen Zhaoying, Pacification Director Jiang Dingwen, etc., requesting that they advocate the repair of the tombs of the two gentlemen. Chen Yi, Chen Zhaoying, and Jiang Dingwen all replied in agreement, and Chen Yi personally donated 300 yuan, pushing Qin to take charge of the matter. The letter from Qin to Lin and Chen and the reply from the two Chens are recorded as follows. Qin's letter to Lin and Chen reads, "Yu Dayou and Zheng Chenggong, two national heroes of the Ming Dynasty in Quanzhou, one swept away the Japanese pirates and pacified the barbarians, and the other resisted the Manchus and developed Taiwan. Their prestige shook all directions, and their achievements covered the entire world. Their great achievements are no less than those of Mr. Qi Jiguang. However, Zheng's tomb was previously looted by bandits in Nan'an, and his descendants buried him hastily, while Yu's tomb has been lost due to years of disrepair and is difficult to find. Recently, according to reports from villagers, Yu's tomb is in a certain place in Jinjiang, south. On the Double Ninth Festival, Shanchai Zhuoran Elementary School students traveled to the top of the mountain several miles south of Fuquan Road, and discovered the tomb of Mr. Xujiang Yu. Although it was desolate, the stone figures were still majestic. Looking at it, one knew it was the burial place of a famous person in the Ming Dynasty. Upon arrival, it was known that Marachong's seal was also looted by people a few years ago. The ancestral hall was covered with weeds, and the arch trees were growing horizontally. It was also known that his descendants were in decline, and almost no one cared. Thinking of the hero, it is sad. At that time, in the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, and other provinces, Japanese pirates and mountain bandits harassed, burned, killed, and plundered, and there was no peaceful year. After Mr. Yu reorganized his army and wiped out the bandits, the southern half of the Yangtze River was stabilized. His merits were to the nation, and his kindness was to the people. Moreover, his morality and articles were outstanding in the universe. His gentle demeanor was worthy of being a Confucian general of the Ming Dynasty. Reading Mr. Zhengqi Tang Ji makes people admire him and yearn for him. Now that his bones are exposed and foxes and mice have made nests, what will his feelings be? At this time, the Japanese pirates are invading, which is worse than in the past. The people of Fujian are depressed. How can we get Yu Zheng and the two gentlemen to rise up and promote their spirits and wash away national shame? Looking ahead, I am extremely sad and indignant. The relics of national heroes should be properly preserved and promoted to inspire the patriotic thoughts of future generations and boost the national spirit. Although Zheng's tomb has been hastily buried by his descendants, it is planned to build a Zheng Gong Memorial Tower on the top of Shijing Mountain in his hometown, so that it will stand tall on the coast of Quanzhou and Xiamen. Yu's tomb is planned to be repaired, erected with stones, and built a pavilion in the original place, and a long bridge will be built across the stream on the side of the Fuquan Xiamen Highway, opening a branch road of one mile to facilitate the admiration and mourning of future generations. It is also planned to organize a Committee for the Repair of the Tombs of the Two National Heroes, Yu and Zheng, to handle these two projects. Please ask the government to allocate funds or for public donations to promote it. If it is not enough, the committee will raise funds to make up for it," and so on. Chen Yi's reply letter reads, "Brother Wangshan, I have received your letter and the photos of Yu's tomb, and I know everything. Yu and Zheng are outstanding in their integrity and will be immortal for thousands of years. The tomb road has been desolate for a long time, and it is urgent to repair it. (Omission) Your proposed construction plans are agreed in principle, but the financial resources of Fujian Province are tight, and public funds cannot be used. I will donate 300 yuan personally, specifically for the repair of the tomb. Please also have the executive director manage it personally. I hope you will accept and reply." Chen Zhaoying's reply letter reads, "Comrade Wangshan, I have read your letter of the 6th in detail. The tombs of Yu Dayou and Zheng Chenggong need to be repaired. Your words are true. I hope you will send an official letter immediately so that I can forward it to the Provincial Government for appropriation for repairs."</p>
<p>According to Yu Dayou and Qi Jiguang at the same time, Pingping Wo Nian, Xunji shoulder to shoulder, especially no first and then. On the 24th, the Jinjiang County Party Department convened representatives from all walks of life to hold a meeting and decided on various proposals: (1) Organize a "Committee for the Repair of the Tombs and Pagodas of Yu and Zheng", and elect Qin Wangshan, Zhuang Chengbo, Zhang Si, Chen Honglian, Wu Guisheng, and fifteen other people as members. The conference telegraphed the Jing Provincial authorities, requesting Chairman Lin, President Jiang, Chairman Chen, and Director Jiang to be the main repairers, and set up a general affairs office and a public affairs department to carry out fundraising, design engineering, etc. and start work.

<h3>Shantou Collecting Export Fees from Overseas Chinese on the Pretext of Inspection; One Yuan Collected Per Person</h3>
<p>Shantou correspondence: People from various counties of Chaozhou and Meizhou who go abroad through Shantou every year average more than 100,000. The former Director of the Seaport Quarantine Station, Xu Xiren, under the guise of constructing an isolation hospital, planned to collect a one-yuan fee for inoculation against foreign diseases from those going abroad. This was to be added when shipping companies sold passenger tickets. Subsequently, overseas Chinese organizations in various regions sent telegrams of opposition, and the proposal was terminated. Last month, after Wang Gongchen took over as director of the station, he again requested the Central Health Administration to approve the collection of a one-yuan inspection fee per overseas Chinese traveler, claiming it was for inspection. At that time, various travel industry organizations in Shantou also telegraphed their opposition to the capital, but to no avail. The inspection fee has now been collected since November 21st. The method is still to have the inns collect it when purchasing ship tickets on behalf of passengers. The Travel Industry Association requested a three-day extension before implementation, but the station refused. On the 22nd, the Zhangjiakou and Sharles steamships departed from Shantou for Siam. When those going abroad went for inoculation, those who did not pay the one-yuan inspection fee were not given an inoculation certificate. Those without a certificate were not allowed to leave the country. The overseas Chinese nationals had no choice but to pay. The Travel Industry Association and overseas Chinese organizations recently jointly telegraphed the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, requesting cancellation, but it is unknown whether it will be approved.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Construction Department Improving Sugar Industry Control Measures with the Agreement of Sugar Merchants and in a Spirit of Official-Merchant Cooperation</h3>
<p>Guangzhou correspondence: The Provincial Government held its 24th session yesterday, resolving many important cases. Among them was a proposal from the Director of the Construction Department to improve the Guangdong sugar industry control measures, requesting a public decision. The Ministry of Industry also inquired, citing that Guangdong farm firms, commercial firms, organizations, etc., had separately requested the maintenance of sugar industry control and the abolition of sugar industry control, etc., hoping for detailed review and reply, along with all relevant separate regulations, etc. This was also resolved through amendments and passage. The reasons and measures proposed by the department to improve the provincial sugar industry control are recorded below.</p>
<p>Reasons:</p>
<p>Guangdong has implemented sugar industry control since 1934 to protect provincial government-run sugar mills and manage imported sugar products. Initially, the intentions were very thorough with the establishment of sugar factories and the planting of sugarcane. However, due to poor management, the results of operation and sales created excuses for harming merchants and farmers. This was due to a lack of competent people, not the control itself. The sugar industry control has changed three times so far. The first was the operating merchant system, where the government selected ten operating merchants to manage the sales affairs of the entire province, with distributors and retail shops set up to assist in sales. The second was the transport merchant system. The authorities considered the operating merchant system to be a multi-headed policy, forming a "three public system," which was difficult to achieve good results. Therefore, the transport merchant system was adopted, with fixed quotas for merchants to bid on, and the highest bidder won, and they were required to pay a huge amount of security deposit and were subject to severe penalties. On the sugar mill side, all sugar product modifications were restricted, and they were not allowed to freely manufacture and sell. The third was the agent system, which is the most recent system. Agents were recruited by district, with sales quotas specified for direct sales, which is a one-level system. However, often after a certain number of agents had been determined for a district, additional agents were added temporarily, resulting in endless disputes. Looking at the above three methods, all have shortcomings. What sugar merchants oppose is the agent monopoly system, which divides sales areas, with each agent occupying territory and raising prices for monopolies. Moreover, there are only a few agents, and a small number of contract-style merchants obtain huge profits, while most sugar merchants lose their business. Now that the Guangdong situation has been renewed, it seems appropriate to propose an improvement method that does not hinder the provincial government-run sugar mills. Therefore, a detailed consultation was convened with the Chamber of Commerce and the Sugar and Flour Guild, adopting a spirit of official-merchant cooperation, and an improved sugar industry control method was formulated as follows.</p>
<p>Measures:</p>
<p>(1) Open sales: All sugar merchants in the province who hold documents proving their sugar industry guild membership (in areas without sugar industry guilds, certified by the local Chamber of Commerce) can register with the Guangdong Provincial Property Management Office, pay a security deposit of 500 yuan, and obtain a sugar industry operating certificate to become a Guangdong registered sugar merchant. (2) Sugar industry registered merchants are not limited by region or number of firms in their sugar sales, demonstrating universality. (3) Sugar industry registered merchants can directly purchase machine-made cane sugar from the Provincial Property Management Office for sale, but each firm must ship at least 30 bags each time. (4) When sugar industry registered merchants ship goods, the Management Office will issue a provincial government-run sugar product delivery certificate, stating the date, weight of goods, and destination, to be transported with the goods to prevent abuses. (5) When the supply of provincial government-run machine-made cane sugar is insufficient, sugar industry registered merchants can purchase imported sugar to meet urgent needs, but when importing, they must first report the name of the seller, the type of sugar, price, and quantity to the Management Office and obtain an import permit before paying customs duties. (6) An industrial construction fee of one yuan per dan will be collected for imported sugar import permits. (7) If sugar industry registered merchants wish to also operate as sugar modification merchants, modifying rock sugar, white sugar, flake sugar, etc., they must pay an additional security deposit of 200 yuan and obtain a modification license. (8) After these measures are implemented, if the government believes they are not perfect, the government may revise them at any time. (9) Separate measures will be formulated for the provincial sugar industry anti-smuggling. Are the above proposed measures appropriate? Respectfully awaiting public adjudication. Proposer: Liu Weichi.</p>
<h3>Songjiang A Gale Brings Down Yellow Sand</h3>
<p>The weather in this county has been warm and humid recently. On the 26th, the temperature suddenly increased in the afternoon, as if it were early autumn. At 7:00 p.m., a gale suddenly arose, and the temperature dropped sharply. The wind blew harder and harder, bringing yellow sand that filled the sky and covered the ground. The objects inside the house were stained with sand until dawn. According to the farmers, the local name is "falling mist sand," which is beneficial to farmland and a sign of a bumper harvest next year. They were all delighted.</p>
<h3>Executing the Bankruptcy Case of Songjiang Bank</h3>
<p>Since the bankruptcy of Songjiang Bank, it has owed a considerable amount of public funds to various organizations and institutions. Afterward, it went through several lawsuits and cleanups, but it has not been completed yet. Later, the creditors of various institutions and public groups designated the county government as the representative of the creditors and hired a lawyer to pursue the case. As a result, both parties reached a settlement, and the debtor (i.e., the directors and supervisors of the bank) was responsible for the cleanup. According to the settlement, regarding the deposit portion of Songjiang Bank, in addition to the successive distributions by the liquidator, there is still a balance of 99,944.477 yuan in national currency, as well as the 5% annual overdue interest from February 8, 1932, to the end of the execution. The debtors Qian Qing, Zhang Jitai, Zhang Xiaomei, Ni Chenchen, and Song Lijiang (i.e., the directors and supervisors) are responsible for clearing and repaying the case. Now, on the creditor's side, more than half a year has passed since the settlement, but there has been no news from the debtor's side. The county government specially convened the relevant institutions and public groups that deposited money in the bank yesterday to discuss the progress plan. According to the resolution, the county government will draft a complaint to the Songjiang District Court to apply for execution.</p>
<h3>Nanhui Promoting the "One Fen Movement"</h3>
<p>In addition to the "One Day Movement" already implemented for the Aid Sui donation, various agencies in the county were initiated by the county party headquarters yesterday to convene various mass organizations, etc., to organize a donation committee to assist the soldiers fighting bandits at the front. The internal organization was determined, divided into general affairs and finance groups, with the county party headquarters taking charge of general affairs and the property office taking charge of finance. The fundraising method is that the staff of each agency and organization donate one day's salary and save on food assistance. Each business donates one-fiftieth of the daily business income, and the Baojia organization is used to promote the "One Fen Movement" in each Jia (i.e., each person pays one fen). This movement will be implemented uniformly in each district from December 13th.</p>
<h3>Changshu A Major Embezzlement by a County Government Clerk</h3>
<p>The county government recently discovered another shocking embezzlement case. The protagonist is Zhang Changqi from Sichuan, a clerk in the Second Section and concurrently the Field Tax Commissioner, who is the most trusted by County Chief Chen. Zhang has been detained for investigation. It is said that the discovery of this case was in the Suzhou Post Office. The Suzhou Postal and Telecommunications Inspector found an express airmail letter the other day while working. It was sent by Zhang Changqi of the Changshu County Government to his home in Sichuan. The inspector suspected that since Changshu City has a post office, why was the letter sent in Suzhou? He opened the letter and found a draft for 1,000 yuan to be sent to his father. The letter stated, in essence, that the previous remittances had been received, and another 1,000 yuan was being sent for your collection. Another 500 yuan will be remitted soon. Judging from his tone, the remittances were not a one-time occurrence. No matter what his current position is, it is impossible to remit such a sum of money in a short period of time. Therefore, suspecting something wrong, he withheld the letter and reported it to the provincial government. The provincial government secretly ordered County Chief Chen to investigate. After Chen received the order, he summoned Zhang Changqi for questioning. Initially, he asked if there had been any recent remittances, and Zhang replied that there had not been. Then, Zhang's original handwritten letter was shown, and Zhang had no words. He only claimed that he had borrowed money from outside to remit. After repeated questioning, Zhang was detained. However, how the money was embezzled is currently being investigated. At the same time, County Accounting Director Zhu Xingliang discovered that more than 4,000 yuan of local donations had not been deposited in the treasury and were left unused. It is suspected that this case is related to Zhang. Zhang previously served as a clerk in Liyang County. This March, he came with County Chief Chen and was initially appointed as a clerk in the Finance Section, then promoted to Field Tax Commissioner and was most trusted and valued by County Chief Chen. Now that the case has broken out, the county chief is also deeply saddened.</p>
<h3>Prisoners Save Food to Support Suiyuan</h3>
<p>There are more than 400 prisoners in the county jail. Recently, upon hearing about the war in Suiyuan and our army's valiant pursuit of bandits, a group initiated a one-day hunger strike, saving money to support Suiyuan. After obtaining the consent of Warden Bei, it was implemented at noon on the 26th. On this day, cooking was stopped for one day, and most prisoners ate pancakes and fried dough sticks. It is said that more than 40 yuan of rations were saved in one day and have been handed over to the bank for remittance to the front to comfort the soldiers fighting bandits.</p>
<h3>Wuxi The Completion of the Taihu Lake Ring Road</h3>
<p>The original plan of the Jiangsu Construction Department for the Taihu Lake Ring Road network is to connect the Suxi Highway with the Yixing to Zhejiang Wuxing section of the Xixia Road, which is part of the Beijing-Fujian trunk line, and then connect to the Hujia Highway, which will soon be open to traffic, and the Sujia Highway, forming a large circular transportation network. The entire line is more than 350 kilometers long, and the entire road project costs more than one million yuan. The Suxi Road project started in the spring of this year and was completed at the end of last month at the same time as the Mugang Road. It has been inspected and accepted by the Construction Department. The entire line is 36 kilometers long and crosses the two counties of Xi and Wu, with Wangting as the boundary. The Shanren Bridge in the section to Su is connected to the Sufu Road, which is commercially operated. Thus, the Taihu Lake Ring Road is completed. The long-distance buses after the opening to traffic will be commercially operated, and the larger ones will be taken over by the Xicheng Bus Company. The reason is that the current Xicheng Road is a section of the Sucheng Highway. If it is undertaken by the Xicheng Company, the entire line can be consistent, and the opening to traffic will be in early spring next year.</p>
<h3>A Sudden Drop of Yellow Sand in a Hurricane</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of winter in Xiyi, the weather has been mild. At 4:30 p.m. on the 26th, a southwest wind suddenly rose, whistling, and the climate quickly turned cold. At 6:40 p.m., the sky was filled, and yellow sand suddenly fell. The inside and outside of the houses were filled with the smell of earth. The sand and dust stopped at 3:00 a.m. on the 27th. After dawn, the tiles and the ground were covered with yellow sand, some with a fraction of an inch. The residents all thought it was strange. According to the investigation, on an autumn afternoon in the 34th year of the Qing Guangxu reign, a strong northwest wind also arose at 3:00 p.m., dropping a large amount of yellow sand. However, in thirty years, this is the second time.</p>
<h3>All Sectors Donate to Support Suiyuan</h3>
<p>In recent days, after the soldiers fighting against the Japanese in Suiyuan's front line recaptured Bailingmiao, people in the county were even more excited, and donations to support Suiyuan became even more enthusiastic. Qing Fufu, a prosecutor at the local court, saved 40 yuan from the wedding banquet to support Suiyuan. The teachers of Huangni Town Elementary School donated one day's salary and the students' candy savings for one week. The Hengfeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Xinhua Cloth Factory, and all employees donated one day's income. Du Shihao, a famous painter from Zhejiang, also donated 50% of his painting income from the 27th to the 29th in Xi. Liyuan, a scenic area, donated one day's ticket income and employee salaries to Suiyuan for assistance.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Winter Defense Period Major Arrest of Vagrants</h3>
<p>The Wuxian Public Security Bureau started its winter defense on the 27th. The bureau also believes that there are many vagrants in Suzhou. During this winter defense period, it is feared that these people will cause trouble and disrupt local public security. It has specially negotiated with the Yumin Training Institute and various charitable organizations to expand the scope of accommodation. The Public Security Bureau has ordered each branch bureau to mobilize all branches and arrest vagrants and beggars from the 27th. They will be sent to the training institute, the reformation institute, and the nursing home and other institutions for accommodation. A group of vagrants who have received news have fled to the countryside to take temporary refuge.</p>
<h3>Fundraising for Aid to Suiyuan</h3>
<p>All circles in Suzhou recently heard that the bandit suppression in Suiyuan had been victorious. The people were unusually excited, and donations to support Suiyuan were also very enthusiastic. The Su Lun Yarn Factory donated 1,000 yuan, Pan Zixin donated 500 yuan, and there were many others who donated 100 to 200 yuan. The Suzhou Boy Scouts will hold an entertainment fair at the Kaiming Grand Theater starting on the 28th to raise money for aid to Suiyuan. Various calligraphers and painters will also hold an aesthetic exhibition at the Lequn Society starting on the 28th. Dozens of calligraphers, painters, and epigraphers, such as Zhou Shoujuan and Zhang Daqian, have exhibits and gifts to participate in. Each ticket costs four jiao of foreign currency and comes with a gift. All proceeds will be used for donations. Students from various schools, the heads of various townships, and various industry associations are also conducting fundraising.</p>
<h3>Changzhou Enthusiastic Donations to Support Suiyuan</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Sui war, all circles in Wuyi have been saddened and angry. They have been working hard to donate money for comfort. The county party headquarters and the county chamber of commerce receive more and more letters and donations every day. For example, the prison inmates' hunger strike to save the country is moving. Minfeng and other yarn factories and cloth factories donated one day's income and sent it to the labor union for transfer to aid Suiyuan. The telephone company has also been saving food for a long time and remitting the money at any time. In recent days, elementary school students have been saving money from candies and other expenses and handing them over to Xing School. The number is even greater. On the 26th, the local cloth industry association convened a meeting of store representative and decided to divide it into four sections with two people in each to solicit donations from the industry. It will be temporarily kept in Qiantaiyong. After the number has been collected, it will be remitted to the chamber of commerce for transfer.</p>
<h3>Xinghua County Middle School Suiyuan Support Movement</h3>

<h3>Zhenjiang A Northwest Hurricane Strikes Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>After 2:00 p.m. on the 26th, a hurricane suddenly arose in the whole city of this port. For a time, sand and stones flew, almost like a mountain rain was about to come. It did not stop until late at night. According to the person in charge of the meteorological station, at 6:00 a.m. today, they received a report from Nanjing saying that a hurricane would pass through this port. The reason is that the high pressure in the upper reaches of the Yellow River is too heavy and gradually spread to the Yangtze River. In the future, the wind will continue to expand and will definitely not leave the town today. It is expected that the wind will start to dissipate after tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin A Major Fire at the Huacheng Cloth Factory</h3>
<p>The Huacheng Dyeing and Weaving Factory in Gaoxiang, the city, is large in scale and has strong capital. It is the first cloth factory in Jiangyin. The shareholders include local gentry Wu Tinglu, etc. There are six branch factories in total. Yesterday (the 27th) at 1:00 a.m., the factory was working the night shift. The workers' dormitory building in the south suddenly caught fire and spread to the cloth warehouse. Due to the strong northwest wind, the fire was fierce. Since there was no water in the city moat, the fire brigades from various districts rushed to the rescue, but it was difficult to put out the fire. The fire did not extinguish until 4:00 a.m. It is estimated that nine upper and nine lower buildings were burned, as well as more than 22,000 pieces of finished cloth, resulting in a loss of more than 10,000 yuan. The factory has fire insurance. The cloth machine room in the north of the telephone bureau on the west side was fortunately preserved. The cause of the fire is unknown, but it is likely to be a discarded cigarette butt.</p>

<h3>Hangzhou Building a Dam to Defend Against the Qiantang Bore</h3>
<p>The sandy land outside Guanyintang in Hangzhou has been severely eroded by the Qiantang River's massive tidal bore, posing a significant threat to the embankment's safety. To counter the river's force and safeguard the embankment, a plan has been formulated to construct three diversion dams, requiring an estimated construction budget of over 50,000 yuan. However, due to the municipal treasury's constraints, a formal request has been submitted to the Construction Department, which will, in turn, forward it to the Provincial Government. The request seeks to allocate the necessary funds from the general reserve fund to facilitate the construction of the essential dams.</p>

<h3>Western League Soccer Match East China Will Fight French Business Today Xu Wenkui Left Shanghai and East China Lost a Lot of Strength French Business is Strong and Tenacious It is Expected that the Fight Will Be Fierce</h3>
<p>In addition to the replay between French Business and Sucker in the Western League this season, this week is already the last week of the first cycle. Today, East China will face its only strong rival, the French Business Club, in the Jia Group match at Yiyuan. However, at this critical juncture for the title, Xu Wenkui, the most active right winger of East China, suddenly left Shanghai for Wuhan due to job reasons. This is a great loss for East China. Although Zhou Guangzhong happened to return and replaced Chen Zhenhe and joined the front line, and Lao Sun made up for Xu's absence, the strength is still considered flawless. However, the new type of initial test, the connection is inevitably unfamiliar. To deal with the tenacious and strong enemy, I am afraid that it will give people a handle, and the future hope will inevitably be dim. As for the individual skills of the East China team members, there are no newcomers. Just be energetic and pay attention to the position of each person. Do less tricks, pay more attention to the French Business Club's attention target, and try to avoid the weaknesses of last week against Laks. Gu Litai is on one side to deal with the right road of French Business, so there is no need to worry. However, Zhou Zhuang must specialize in cutting off the activities of Bao Xiutuo and Jie Mu Huate, then the chances of winning are not without grasp. As for the lineup of the French Business Club today, the reporter went to the Donation Office of the French Public Works Bureau on Malang Road yesterday and asked the captain of the team, Bao Xiutuo. The determined lineup is the same as when the team held a plane donation match against East China at the beginning of the month, with only two backup players added. Since East China has already suffered everything last time, this battle has more ways to find and will not be like groping in the dark and unable to get the handle. As for Li Yichen of East China, it is said that he arrived in Shanghai the night before and may be able to play today. According to the reporter's inquiry with the club yesterday, the club said that they had not heard of it and had not seen him come to the club to cancel the leave, so this statement will be difficult to realize. However, Li Ning's injury has slightly healed and he can fight hard, so it is not a problem to deal with the right road of French Business. Another Group A match today is between Western Business and Sucker, held at the Racecourse. It is about the competition for the bottom of the list, and both sides will strive to go all out. The fierce battles in each Group A match this week are related to the promotion of each team. The two reserve matches, Jinan meets Laks in Hongkou Park, which can have a wonderful contribution. There are also three Group B matches, one Group C match, and one Junior Cup replay. The order is as follows:</p>

<h3>Last Night's Basketball Games: Xiqing vs. Nanyang Postponed, Jingwu Team Defeats Philippines, Maisons A Team Defeats B Team</h3>
<p>Today's Schedule Changed</p>
<p>The Xiqing basketball game schedule had a slight change yesterday. The college group game between Chihchih and Nanyang was postponed at Chihchih's request. Consequently, the ordinary group game between Jingwu and the Philippines, originally scheduled for 6:15 PM today, was moved forward. The Jingwu players are all renowned martial arts experts, such as Zheng Jichang and Li Ruihua, who are skilled in boxing, hence their energy is abundant, causing the frail and short Philippine team members to retreat. Furthermore, the Philippines' technique is more elementary than Jingwu's, leading to a 34-18 defeat. As for the Maisons A vs. B game, although they were brothers from the same family, the competition was fierce. The A team pressed too hard, resulting in a 44-18 defeat. Today's competition, originally scheduled to start at 4:15 PM, has been changed to start at 5:15 PM because the Philippines-Jingwu game has been moved forward. The schedule has been slightly modified, and the details are as follows:</p>
<p>Today's Schedule</p>
<p>Muller vs. Shanghai Middle School, Ordinary Group, 6:15 PM</p>
<p>Yueh Chung vs. Xiqing, Ordinary Group, 6:30 PM</p>
<p>DeHan vs. Tongji, College Group, 7:00 PM</p>

<h3>Qingwu Handball Team A Team Achieves a Decisive Victory Over Xiqing, 5 to 1, Yan Peiqiu Battles Krammer, B Team Game: Xiqing Also Wins 5 to 1</h3>
<p>The friendly match between the Qingwu handball team and Xiqing resulted in the Qingwu A team winning 5 to 1 against Xiqing after two nights of fierce battles, while the B team suffered a bitter defeat of 1 to 5. The night before, Qingwu was already leading with two wins and one loss in the A team. Last night, they achieved a great victory again, thus winning with 5 to 1. As for the B team, the Qingwu players are still in the early stages of learning, so they are no match for the veteran players of Xiqing who have been fighting for a long time. It is said that Xiqing's Pan Jinsi, who defeated Zhu Kuan the year before, is now attending the B team game, and he is considered the eleventh player, which is enough to show the strength of Xiqing's B team. One of the most intense matches last night was the battle between Yan Peiqiu and Krammer. After Yan Peiqiu took the first game with 21 to 9, Krammer pulled it back in the second game during a stalemate. In the third game, Krammer took the lead with 7 to 0, but Yan Peiqiu finally won the final victory with a brilliant shot. In another group, Wang Binglin targeted Jonah's weaknesses and attacked him unprepared, winning both games. The victory of Hua Fenggang over Ke Xunailun was a complete one-sided situation due to the huge gap in strength. In the B team, in addition to the complete defeat of the 10th and 12th groups, Zhu Hongqing's victory over Fu Luolin was the most difficult. Not only was Zhu the only winner in the six games of the B team, but he also focused on working hard under the complete control of the opponent, catching up step by step, and finally winning with a corner kick, which was truly commendable. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Yesterday's Results</p>
<p>(2) Yan Peiqiu Qing A defeated Krammer Xi A 21-9, 16-21, 21-10</p>
<p>(4) Hua Fenggang Qing A defeated Ke Xunailun Xi A 21-4, 21-5</p>

<h3>Special Feature: Prospects for China's Tung Oil Export Trade (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zai Jun</p>
<p>Recent Two Years Comparison Chart of U.S. Construction Costs by Month (Note 4)</p>
<p>In Millions of Dollars</p>

<p>Whether the Democratic or Republican Party is in power in the United States, construction will continue to be carried out to achieve prosperity. Moreover, the construction of new houses and the renovation of old houses in the United States are urgent needs in the future. In recent years, the construction industry will inevitably continue to increase. Tung oil is an indispensable material for painting houses. Now that the U.S. construction industry is growing day by day, the demand for tung oil supply must also be very high, which goes without saying.</p>
<p>Judging from the above-mentioned situations, we can see that the demand for tung oil in countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, and France will all tend to increase in the future. This is truly good news for China's tung oil export trade. However, this only refers to aspects where numbers can be checked. For example, the demand for tung oil in the chemical industries of various countries is also increasing day by day. In the United States, there are nearly 800 kinds of products in the chemical industry that use tung oil as a raw material. Moreover, the United States is extremely developed in scientific research, and there are unlimited uses for tung oil in the future. If European countries are the same as the United States, the sales of tung oil will increase even more. In addition, tung oil has become a necessity for advanced industrial countries in modern times and is also one of the military supplies. During this period of world rearmament, the demand for tung oil will inevitably increase, which is expected.</p>
<p>In short, the demand for tung oil in various countries in the world will definitely tend to increase in the near future, it can be asserted. Moreover, tung oil has always been produced exclusively in China, and other countries cannot compete with us. Although the United States and other places are making every effort to promote tung tree planting and focusing on self-sufficiency, they are currently unable to do so. For example, in 1929, U.S. oil millers once petitioned the government to levy import taxes on Chinese tung oil. Later, paint merchants believed that the time was not yet ripe, so it was temporarily shelved, which shows that the demand for Chinese tung oil in foreign markets is still strong. If we can take advantage of the current good opportunity, rise up and strive to improve the quality of tung oil, increase the production of tung oil, facilitate domestic and foreign transportation, vigorously reduce production costs, pay attention to the organization of collection, and eliminate the manipulation of foreign merchants, etc., then the future of export trade will have unlimited hope. It is hoped that those in the country who operate this industry and the relevant authorities of our government will pay attention to this.</p>

<h3>Finance Gold Bar Market Shows No Change – Lacking Stimulation Mid-Course –</h3>
<p>Although gold market fluctuations have narrowed, sentiment remains stable, presenting a  situation where the day's trend initially stabilizes and then flattens out, resulting in no significant gains or losses. Initially, the overseas silver market saw London declining and the US remaining steady, with exchange rates rising. London spot gold fell by 1.5 pence. The Central Bank's official rates were announced, with both the UK and US unchanged. Customs gold unit fell by 0.02 taels. The standard gold bar price was listed at $1154.4. In off-exchange trading, due to stable sentiment, retail investors made slight purchases, pushing the price up to around $1156. The morning opened slightly higher, and floating holders continued to buy, causing a slight increase. However, major players remained inactive. The HSBC's official rates were announced, with both the UK and US unchanged, and the silver equalization tax was reduced by 0.25. Although there was little impact mid-course, the trend gradually moved downwards. Major players took advantage of the lower prices to maintain their positions, leading to stagnation. The same was true at noon. The afternoon market remained mediocre, steady but tired, and ultimately showed no change from the previous close. Swap transactions saw sellers posting $1.1 interest. The day's market conditions are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The morning opening was $1155.9, up $0.2 from the previous close. Xiang, Hongchang, and Yongjin rose to $1156.2. Fuxing, Yongtong, Yurun, Dadecheng, Qianchang, Xiangtong, and Fengheng all actively sold. HSBC's official rates were announced, with both the UK and US unchanged, and the silver equalization tax was reduced by 0.25. With little mid-course stimulation, the price gradually retreated to $1155.6. Qia Lan, Yongqing, and Fayong made purchases to provide support. After fluctuating, the noon close was $1155.7.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at $1155.7. Hongchang, Yongyuan, and Mao Yonglai bought, gradually pushing the price up to $1155.9. The Indian silver report showed a small profit of 3 annas. Tiande Cheng Lai sold, dropping the price to $1155.6. Yuan Mao Yong took advantage of the lower prices to add positions, closing at $1155.7.</p>
<p>The closing price, based on the Central Bank's standard gold bar price, was listed at $1154.4. Based on the closing price, the actual premium was over $1. For November account settlements, the price was $1154. For December, it was $1156. The morning water supplement was $1153. The spot market remained firm. Tianjin goods were priced with an additional $12.5, while raw trade prices were priced with an additional $10, with a selling price of $14.5. Dafeng Heng sold 50 taels to the Hankou group. Swap transactions saw Yuan Mao Yong paying Cheng Da interest on 84 contracts at $1.65. In the afternoon market, Dadecheng paid Cheng Da interest on 28 contracts at $1.7.</p>
<p>There were few transactions in the market. Overall, Qingfa Yongyi, Dahongchang, Yongxiang, Fengzhi, Fengyong, and Yuan Mao Yong were among the buyers, while Dadecheng, Tongfeng Heng, Tongyurun, Qianchang, Xiang, Fuxing, and Yongheng were among the sellers.</p>
<p>The day's market conditions were calm. The morning opening was $1155.9, and the closing was $1155.7. The highest price was $1156.2, and the lowest was $1155.6, with a fluctuation of $0.6. The final result showed no change from the previous close. There were 1652 outstanding December contracts, with 4 long positions and 20 short positions. For January contracts, there were 5551 outstanding, with 35 long positions and 24 short positions. The total trading volume was 231 contracts in the morning and 133 contracts in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Relies on Bank Support – Although Major Players Sell, the Result is Still Flat –</h3>
<p>Although there were large-scale sales by major Chinese merchants in the foreign exchange market yesterday, bank support stabilized the situation. The morning began with overseas telegrams reporting that the New York commercial market was completely shut down due to labor strikes. Only London experienced a decrease of 0.0625 for both near and far terms. London spot gold fell by 1.5 pence. The British pound against the US dollar rose by 0.125, while the British pound against the French franc remained unchanged. The Central Bank's official rates were announced, with both the UK and US unchanged. The Customs gold unit fell by 0.02 taels. The morning opening prices for the near-term foreign exchange market were 1 shilling and 2.5625 pence for the British pound, and $29.6875 and $29.75 for the US dollar, with no change in either the British pound or US dollar compared to the previous close. After the opening, banks sold, and Hong Kong slightly purchased. HSBC's official rates were announced, with both the UK and US unchanged, and the market remained stable. The silver equalization tax announcement showed a reduction of 0.25. Later, banks were actively selling, with some counter-trading, leading to fluctuations. Banks gradually absorbed the supply, and the noon market became even calmer. In the afternoon market, major Chinese merchants sold forward-term shillings and US dollars, but banks absorbed the entire amount. The Indian silver small profit of 3 annas had little impact, and the market remained stable. The closing prices for the near-term foreign exchange market were 1 shilling and 2.5625 pence for the British pound, and $29.6875 and $29.75 for the US dollar, with no change in either the British pound or US dollar compared to the previous close. Chinese merchants slightly reduced their positions, and Hong Kong settled some spot US dollar positions. The day's transactions are recorded as follows:</p>

<h3>Securities Public Bond Delivery of 19 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the public bond market of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange handled the November futures delivery period. The total delivery amount was 19,470,000 yuan. Of this, 13,855,000 yuan was settled by brokers themselves, while only 5,615,000 yuan was delivered through the exchange. No. 71 received the most bonds, while No. 43 and No. 71 also delivered a significant amount. The market's performance since September 26th, when trading began, was severely affected by the Hongkou incident, leading to extreme tension and panic. Market prices gradually declined. By October 1st, the situation became even more tense, and the downward trend intensified, with prices approaching the lowest levels since trading began. However, many short sellers profited, and the pressure gradually eased, leading to an upward trend. After October 11th, the situation remained very quiet, and sentiment was uncertain. During this mid-month period, the market price saw a prolonged period of consolidation as long and short positions held steady. After November 1st, the bullish momentum gradually increased, and the trend became more pronounced, with prices rising slowly. On November 13th, fueled by favorable rumors, the upward trend intensified, and unified compensation bonds reached new highs after the first dividend payment. Later, many long positions gradually liquidated, and the situation in North China became more serious, causing the market to slightly retrace. However, on the final day, due to active buying and short sellers eager to cover their positions, there was a strong short squeeze. However, due to the strength of the market sentiment, it was difficult for the market to decline significantly despite the serious situation. The difference between the highs and lows was estimated to be between 5.6 yuan and 7.5 yuan. The total trading volume was 33,189,000 yuan. The transaction volume for delivery and clearing is listed in the table below (unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<p>November Futures Delivery Table</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Three Grade Yarn Gradually Declines, Marked Yarn Market Prices Gradually Converge</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to rise, and the trend remained strong. This was because a certain party continued to take in large batches of yarn, and a certain individual also purchased in large quantities, resulting in a tighter market situation. The market continued to rise, but many long positions had already emerged among traders. Osaka Three Grade Yarn steadily declined, falling by about 10 yuan compared to the peak. A few days ago, the price of marked yarn was more than 10 yuan lower than the price of Three Grade Yarn. The closing price this month was only 1.6 yuan lower.</p>
<p>Many Floating Positions Were Squeezed Out</p>
<p>The marked yarn market opened higher in the morning, continuing the upward trend from the previous day. This was because a certain individual continued to take in large quantities of yarn, resulting in a very tight market. In the second session, the Osaka Three Grade Yarn market declined, and Qingdao yarn prices fell by 6 yuan, causing sentiment to weaken slightly. By the close, due to the continued presence of buyers, prices rebounded again, but some traders still liquidated their positions. The marked yarn market closed with near-term prices up 1.1 yuan and far-term prices up 2.5 yuan compared to the previous day. The market opened flat in the afternoon, with Three Grade Yarn continuing to decline by 2 yuan. After the second session, a certain party continued to purchase in large quantities, pushing prices higher. By the close, the upward trend was even more intense, with each month jumping 1 yuan. The December price broke through the 40 yuan mark, mainly because today was the delivery day, and the day after tomorrow was Sunday, with the risk of a market closure for one day, causing general floating positions to be squeezed out.

<h3>US and Indian Cotton Markets Closed, Three-Grade Yarn Prices Decline</h3>
<p>The US and Indian cotton markets were closed yesterday. British cotton spot prices were unchanged, and futures prices rose by 12 points. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram dated November 26).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening price forecast for November 27 was 218 rupees for White Rose, down 0.25 rupees; 199.5 rupees for Omra, up 0.75 rupees; and 162 rupees for Pingguo, down 0.25 rupees.</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Osaka on November 27, Three-Grade futures yarn fell by 0.4 to 3 yuan, with near-term contracts at 241.3 yuan and far-term contracts at 214.7 yuan. Futures cotton fell by 0.1 yuan to rise by 0.05 yuan, with near-term contracts at 65.65 yuan and far-term contracts at 66.7 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Sudden Cold Weather Leads to a Surge in Flannelette Retail Sales Although Yarn Prices Decline Slightly Yesterday, Sentiment in the Cloth Market Gradually Stabilizes However, Demand from Customer Groups Remains Strong, Making it Difficult for Prices to Return to Lower Levels</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the cotton cloth market, due to sluggish sales of spot yarn and thread and a slight decline in yarn prices, sentiment gradually stabilized. However, spot sales remained good, with prices for white goods rising by about 0.05 yuan per piece. Demand from Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, and Yunnan remained strong, with local selling prices matching those in Shanghai, leading to vigorous efforts to procure spot goods. The most traded items were fine cloth, fine twill, lightweight coarse cloth, crepe, Mingxing cloth, shirting, blue cloth, Zhigong cloth, and serge. In addition, more than 500 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill for December futures were also ordered, with prices about 0.1 yuan (per piece) lower than spot prices. Due to shallow waters along the Yangtze River, there were inquiries, and everyone was rushing to procure goods, with about half of them being for storage purposes. Merchants from Shaanxi and Henan showed some activity, with Zhigong cloth, serge, and black satin being traded. Zhigong cloth and serge inventory remained abundant, but black satin was becoming scarce, with prices rising by about 0.01 yuan (per yard). Based on the increase in gray fabric prices, all subsequent printed fabrics and blue cloth, shirting, and bleached cloth will have to increase significantly. Yesterday's cold weather led to a surge in sales of flannelette goods at retail stores, and dark blue cloth also became more active.</p>
<h3>Grain Flour Futures Market Is Very Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning, presented an image of initial stability followed by stagnation. The price of foreign wheat, with Chicago closed, Canadian wheat prices were slightly better by $0.04 for the near term and $0.16 for the far term. Liverpool rose by 1 penny, so after the opening price, the market atmosphere was quite stable. The price of each month was $0.01 better than the previous day. However, this month has just passed, and there were few buyers and sellers of the far term, and therefore the trend stopped and it was difficult to see any improvement. Until the afternoon opening, due to the quieter buying interest, the trading volume of each month decreased, and the market was also slightly tired, falling by $0.005 compared to the previous day. Judging from the situation, if the sales in the north are not smooth, the future will lack vitality.</p>
<h3>Long Positions Slightly Liquidate, Near-Term Wheat Appears Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market, at the morning opening, presented a relatively flat and distant appearance. Foreign wheat prices still saw a slight increase, and when the price was announced, this month was already in the delivery period, with 39 cars of delivery. Since December was close to this month, the difference reached $0.10, which was inevitably too large, so sentiment was not good. There were not many sellers in the far term, and there were few external pull-ins, so it was better by $0.02-0.04. Until the afternoon opening, the December market atmosphere was still soft, and retail investors sold their positions, losing $0.03-0.04. Transactions in the far term were very quiet, with little change. The spot wheat market then became quite stable, because Shaanxi merchants began to act, and people's hearts were easily agitated. Jiangbei wheat opened at $6.1, Tiantai wheat at $6.04, and Huaian wheat at $6.13. Local factories purchased a total of over 1,000 bags. Shaanxi merchants purchased over 30 tons of Huaicheng wheat at a price of $6.16.</p>
<h3>Non-glutinous Rice Still Relies on Northern Sales</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, more sources came from various groups, with a total of 140-150 shipments arriving, totaling 32,300-32,400 shi. Fortunately, the bag-holding appetite was also smooth. Northern merchants purchased over 15,000 bags of thin rice and nearly 3,000 bags of thick glutinous rice. Therefore, although the outbound traffic on this street was flat, the market conditions were able to support it. The prices of thick and thin glutinous rice were stable, as were Duyangjian prices. However, Yinbian Yuan offerings exceeded demand, presenting a softening appearance.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 43 or 44 shipments arrived from various places downstream. The sales of various goods on the market and the slightly shorter prices of white glutinous rice shop were good, and there was some activity. The market shape was stable, and Yangbu Dujian goods were collected normally. The market price was flat. Sales of thin rice on this street were normal. The customer group heard that Qingpei Zhuanlai Temple and other places were preventing shipments, which led to continued purchases of Tianjin smoke, and the shape turned tight. White yuan goods had strong appetite but were dull, and the price was a few points tired. The rest of the prices were tired but stable.</p>
<h3>Oil Market From the Ten-Month Inspection of Tung Oil Observe Exports Are Greatly Reduced Domestic Sales Are Expanded, but Ultimately Not as Large as Exports</h3>
<p>According to the report of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the qualified tung oil exports from the local port in October amounted to 1,629.57 hectoliters, a decrease of 3,182.85 hectoliters compared to 4,812.42 hectoliters in the same month last year. The cumulative total since January of this year is 80,427.64 hectoliters, a decrease of 31,004.45 hectoliters compared to the same period last year. In terms of shipping countries, exports to the UK, US, France and other countries are not as prosperous as last year. The quantity of domestic sales has been increasing month by month. The quantity of exports to each port this month increased by 2,177.11 hectoliters compared to the same month last year. The total number for this year (ten months) increased by 6,284.85 dan compared to last year. However, the quantity of domestic sales is not as considerable as that of exports, so the development of the tung oil trade must wait for the turning point of overseas needs. The statistical tables for exports and domestic sales are attached below:</p>

<h3>Soybean Sales Lack Enthusiasm</h3>
<p>In the last two days, soybean sales have lacked enthusiasm, and the market atmosphere has been quite sluggish. The total transaction volume in the city is less than 1,000 bags, including one car of Siping Street beans, 400 bags of Xiashi yellow beans, and 72 bags of Dingjiazhou beans. At the close of the market, it was heard that Dalian City continued to report an increase, and the oil mills loaded ten cars of Siping Street beans, and the market price was $0.03 lower than the opening price in the morning, at $5.55. The tendency to move forward is brewing, and it cannot be predicted for a while.</p>
<h3>Few Customers Arrive and Few Goods Are Sold</h3>
<p>Yesterday's customer Xian market conditions showed that the sources were still scarce. Although the measures to ban and restrict transportation from the producing areas have been resolved, the winter water is moisturizing, transportation is inconvenient, and direct sales from other ports are also active. Merchants are less involved, and therefore many cargo owners are willing to sell their goods with the market. However, yesterday's customers were lightened, and Tongshi only took about 4,000 bags from Guangdong merchants. Shantou took about 400-500 yuan. There were not many receptions on this street, and the market situation was just started. Statistics show that 1,886 bags of Jiangxi rice, 900 bags of Hunan rice, 260 bags of Yongtai rice, and 2,400 bags of big squeeze were opened. The market conditions were similar to the previous market.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea  Zhejiang Silk Up 15 Yuan from Last Week</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the New York silk market was closed (Thanksgiving holiday), and the Yokohama silk price fell again. Spot prices fell by 25 yuan, and futures prices fell by 27 yuan, so the Shanghai market situation was quite dull. There was no movement in French sales, and users rarely sold. Yesterday's silk market only reached Da Feng's purchase of 10 bales of white factory silk, and Yongtai's supplement of 60 bales, and there were no other transactions. There are continuous sales of printed Zhejiang silk and Mianyang silk, such as 595 yuan for Zhejiang silk XGJM and 670 yuan for Red Dragon, which is an increase of 15 yuan from last week (November 20).</p>
<h3>Persian Merchants Purchase Gongxi Tea</h3>
<p>Due to the urgent demand from foreign countries, and the insufficient inventory, the low-end Zhuangzhenmei green tea has been rising in price, and the market price rose by 2-3 yuan again yesterday. The sales of medium-grade Zhuangzhenmei tea on the roads of Tunxi and Shexian are also not lonely. In addition, Persian merchants also started purchasing Gongxi green tea due to the launch of sales in printed Zhejiang. The situation is gradually improving.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Gao Huanggang Qing Rises 4 Jiao The Chao Gang Opens More Than 90 Bags</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market, only Chao Qing rose due to the rarity of the arrival, and the rest were flat. The Guild divided 24 coarse granulated white spot into 21 yuan and 5 jiao, and then 5 points, and the transshipment into 6 yuan and 8 points. Dongbai No. 489 and the local factorys Mianbai Zhenji Dahua Jinxin and other brands have not changed. Only Chao Gang opened more than 90 bags of Gao Huanggang Qing, 13 yuan and 4 jiao.</p>
<p>The co-formed company was the third time this week that it had exchanged Cantonese sugar. The total quota was more than 18,000 bags, and the bidding price was as before. Shunde Factory's Wuyang coarse white 1,070 bags, Huizhou and 50 bags were sold at 21 yuan and 3 jiao, and Shixin Factory 415 bags were sold at 21 yuan and 1 jiao, and the rest were not sold.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods  Not Many Arrival in Haikou Branches</h3>
<p>Recently, the dried lychees from Haikou, Shuidong, etc. have been scarce due to lack of production in the production areas, and the prices have turned up, so there are very few sources. It is found that the total number of imported goods from Guangdong the previous day was only 18 pieces, and the previous arrivals in this area have been opened, and most of them are in the hands of the parties concerned. There are also only 3,000 outer boxes in total, and it is not easy to see loose markets, and there is a possibility of turning tight.</p>
<h3>Sundries The Opening Price of Sand Red Skin Increased by Three Yuan</h3>
<p>Sources of Haikou sand red skin have been rare for a long time. It has been found that there were only 4 pieces imported from Qiongzhou the other day, so the market situation is tight. Yesterday, it was heard that it had opened to 70 yuan, an increase of three yuan. The rest of the Shui Ting skins and Baishui Qing are not sold due to the passage of the sales order. Although the parties concerned have stock in hand, they are temporarily lacking buyers.</p>
<h3>Consoling the Rescue Association: Yesterday's Meeting to Console the Representatives Sent to Suiyuan; Representatives Submit Written Reports on the Progress; Resolution to Solicit Medicine and Cold-Weather Supplies</h3>

<p>Written Report</p>
<p>The Suiyuan Consolation Group's report states: Xiaolai and other representatives from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Local Association, and the General Association of the Chinese Red Cross Society, which jointly formed the Suiyuan Bandit Suppression Consolation and Rescue Committee, took the broadcasting airplane lent by Deputy Commander Zhang Hanqing on the 23rd. At 10 a.m., they took off from Shanghai, briefly stopped at Hankou at noon to add engine oil, and then proceeded. Around 5 p.m., they arrived in Xi'an and met with Deputy Commander Zhang, Director Yang Hucheng, and Chairman Shao Lizi. After a thorough discussion, they all shared the same enthusiastic outlook on the future of bandit suppression in Suiyuan. The enthusiastic sentiments of the military and civilians in Xi'an were no less than those in other places. Madam Yang and Madam Shao personally came out to solicit donations and disclosed information to various newspapers. On the morning of the 24th, at 8 a.m., they flew to Jin and arrived in Taiyuan at 10 a.m. Deputy Chairman Yan Baichuan, Chairman Zhao Jueglong, and military and political leaders and local figures all expressed their welcome. They spoke thoroughly with Yan and Zhao, describing their intentions. Yan expressed himself in great detail and sincerity, stating that although Jin and Sui were two provinces, their military, political, and financial affairs were essentially one family. They had already made considerable preparations for all the military needs of bandit suppression, but they would certainly welcome the public's delivery of medicines, cold-weather supplies, and consolation items. On the same day, they received the good news that Bailingmiao had been captured at 9 a.m., which made them all extremely happy. Despite the years of hardship and difficulty in Jin Province, they were still able to make continuous progress in various construction projects, which was admirable. On the morning of the 25th, they flew from Taiyuan to Suiyuan. As soon as they passed Yanmen Pass, all the mountains were covered in snow. They arrived in Suiyuan before noon. Chairman Fu Yisheng, who was originally at the front line supervising the battle, returned to Sui upon hearing of their arrival and personally welcomed them at the airfield. They were led to the guest house in the old city and given a detailed account of their intentions. At that time, the 100,000 yuan raised in Shanghai had also been remitted by the Bank of China. After presenting it to Chairman Fu, Chairman Fu, on behalf of all the military and civilians, expressed his deep gratitude and solemnly stated that all donations received here would be stored in a special account, awaiting the disposal and distribution of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Deputy Chairman Yan, and would not be moved without authorization. He also gave a detailed account of the Battle of Bailingmiao, stating that the attack began at 1:30 a.m. on the 23rd and was captured at 9 a.m. on the 24th. Around 10 a.m., enemy planes arrived and immediately turned back upon seeing that it had fallen. In the afternoon at 4 p.m., they came again to drop bombs. It was estimated that more than 300 soldiers were wounded or killed in this battle. Since the start of the bandit suppression, there have been more than 500 casualties in total. They requested Chairman Fu to withdraw 5,000 yuan from the 100,000 yuan to distribute to the wounded soldiers. The victory at Bailingmiao was considered to be of great significance because the enemy had many stations along the line from Dolon, Zhangbei, and Shangdu to the west, all with military deployments and equipment, with Bailingmiao as the center. Once destroyed, the east and west could not be connected. It was difficult to guarantee that there would not be a large-scale counterattack, but our side was fully prepared. There were no bandits in Sui at present. Countless military supplies such as machine guns and rifles were obtained in this battle. The flour item alone was estimated to be more than 20,000 bags. Because Bailingmiao was a transportation hub station, it stored a lot of engine oil, which was all confiscated. Among the prisoners, someone resembling a certain national would not speak, but many documents had been seized. Four enemy planes had been shot down before and after. Prince De was not intentional, but was deceived. The above were all Chairman Fu's words. Chairman Fu was a capable, composed, upright, and exemplary military man at first sight. They immediately wrote a declaration on the spot and sent it to various newspapers in Suiyuan and Baotou for publication, in order to extend their condolences to all the military and civilians, and to hope that the bandits who had been deceived would repent and return. Immediately afterwards, they visited the wounded soldiers' hospitals to express their condolences. Chairman Fu also expressed his gratitude for the continued supply of cold-weather items and medicines. After a public banquet at the Provincial Government in the new city, they flew back to Taiyuan at 3 p.m. On the morning of the 26th, they flew to Luoyang in a strong wind, with the wind speed at 54 kilometers per hour. The sky was full of yellow sand, and the plane flew above the sand layer at a height of 14,000 feet. At 10:45 a.m., they arrived in Luoyang and met with Chairman Chiang to present public opinions. Chairman Chiang instructed them to express his gratitude to the public organizations and the public, and that he had full determination and preparation for the future of bandit suppression in Suiyuan, which could be comforting. That afternoon, they flew back to Shanghai. The entire trip was by air, covering a distance of more than 7,400 li in four days. The people from all walks of life were concerned about the entire country and believed that the people of the whole country should come out to help wherever there was trouble. There was a unified and clear expression of national concept and national consciousness. In Jin and Sui, the public was deeply moved by the director's sacrifice for the country. Based on the results of comprehensive contact with various parties, it was confirmed that the front line needed cash, cold-weather supplies, and medical and hygiene products. Among the cold-weather supplies, such as leather jackets, the old ones were also suitable. As for vests and gloves, they were easy to handle in the south, and many families could make them themselves. Among the hygiene products, it was best to give each soldier a medicine kit for emergency use when injured, which could be purchased for three or four packs per silver dollar. As for gas masks, they were also needed, and it was hoped that all sectors of society would pay special attention to this. This is a report, and it is hoped that our public organizations, people from all walks of life, and the entire public will continue to work hard. Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Huang Yanpei, Lu Jingshi, Yan Fuqing, Pang Jingzhou, and others, together. November 27, 1936.</p>
<p>Organizing a Rescue Team</p>
<p>According to Mr. Pang Jingzhou, a representative of the Red Cross, who expressed his personal feelings to the Central News Agency reporter, he and others departed from Shanghai, first to Xi'an, then to Taiyuan, and then to Gui Sui, and returned. The details of the process have been reported. The special attention of this meeting was for rescue matters. Director Yan of Jin Province attached special importance to rescue matters. It is said that in terms of rescue equipment, materials worth 200,000 yuan have been ordered. In terms of talent, in addition to the existing military doctors, there are also the Chuanzhi Hospital and church hospitals run by Director Yan, as well as all the teachers and students of the Shanxi Provincial Hospital, who are considered for deployment. The five pharmacies in Taiyuan, including Zhongxi Wuzhou, Huaying, and Zhenhua, although they do not have many sanitary materials in stock, can provide a considerable supply. When they went to Sui, Chairman Fu said that the military doctors could barely cope with the current situation, but once the war expanded, and the villages outside the Great Wall were sparsely populated, there would not be enough medicines and talents, and there would be great difficulties in setting up wounded soldiers' hospitals and transporting wounded soldiers. In Suiyuan City, there is currently a wounded soldiers' hospital, which has taken in fifty or sixty soldiers injured in the Battle of Honggeertu. Because there was no way to accommodate them, they were sent to various church hospitals in Datong via the Ping Sui Road for treatment. In Sui, only the limbs of the wounded soldiers were injured. There were also two or three officials with more serious injuries, who are now staying in the public hospital in the provincial capital. The hospital is run by Belgian missionaries, but has only a hundred beds. The director of surgery, Mr. Wang, a graduate of Aurora University, is extremely busy, so he telegraphed the Peking Central Hospital to hire two assistants to go there, which will arrive in Sui soon. The Suiyuan Branch of the Red Cross Society is assisting in transportation and accommodation. In the Battle of Bailingmiao, more than 300 of our soldiers were injured, mostly by bomb fragments, and are being transported to the rear for treatment. After that, the rear hospitals can only be set up in Taiyuan. However, Suiyuan is separated by mountains and has few large cities. Places such as Yunzhong and Yangmingbao do not have suitable houses to be converted into hospitals. Therefore, in the future, only schools can be temporarily suspended and converted into wounded soldiers' hospitals. In addition, a larger-scale wounded soldiers' hospital should be established in Taiyuan, and a wounded soldiers' committee should be set up to be responsible for the transportation and supply of wounded soldiers. This matter has been adopted by Chairman Fu. Regarding the implementation of major surgery, it is planned to adopt a special system, with medicines and equipment being provided by the south, and hiring surgeons, assistants, and nurses to organize several rescue teams to go to the location to accommodate wounded soldiers and perform surgery. Now Director Yan has ordered Dean Jin of Chuanzhi Hospital to take care of everything in Suiyuan. In the future, all parties can contact Dean Jin for rescue matters. The most lacking medicines in the front line are Danish serum, tetanus serum, chain lock serum, and glucose injection. If there are pharmaceutical companies willing to donate, the above-mentioned medicines are the best. When he returned to Beijing, he sent a letter to Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Pingda Medical College, etc., to consult with various parties on detailed plans to assist the front line in handling rescue matters.</p>
<p>Fu's Letter of Thanks</p>
<p>The Consolation and Rescue Association received a letter from Chairman Fu: To the patriotic colleagues from all walks of life in Shanghai, I have received the 100,000 yuan donated by Mr. Wang Xiaolai and others to Sui. The three armies are ordered to celebrate with joy. In memory of your enthusiasm, I am extremely grateful. In addition to motivating all departments to work hard to defend the country, in order to repay your expectations, I respectfully extend my thanks on behalf of all officers and soldiers, and fill out a receipt, which I hope will be checked. Sincerely, Fu Zuoyi, Chairman of the Suiyuan Provincial Government.</p>
<p>Issuing Receipts</p>
<p>The association previously decided to entrust 26 banks and money shops in the city to collect donations.

<h3>German Consul General Kriebel Issues Statement: Defending the Contents of the German-Japanese Agreement; Does Not Recognize Manchukuo and Does Not Harm Chinese Friendship; No New Attempts Other Than Anti-Communism</h3>
<p>New Voice News Agency reports that after the conclusion of the German-Japanese agreement, there were many discussions in various countries. Now, the German Consul General in Shanghai, Kriebel, made a special statement to the press yesterday, saying that the result of the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact cannot lead Germany to recognize the so-called "Manchukuo." I do not believe that Germany will take any action that will harm Chinese friendship. German industry is seeking raw materials abroad, and we want to maintain friendship with all countries in the world. Germany's love of peace is more sincere than any other country. He continued, "Various rumors and suspicions are unbelievable. There are no military agreements binding Germany and Japan. The Anti-Comintern Pact is only concluded between Japan and Germany because they are dissatisfied with Marxism. Those who are worried about aggression and oppression are not worth laughing at. We have no other new attempts, but are limited to countering Bolshevism. However, there is a possibility that we will leave room for countries that have not yet expressed their attitudes. Prime Minister Hitler and Prime Minister Hirota said in their statements that they did not want to provoke war, but were committed to peace, and this agreement can be said to be the cornerstone of maintaining world peace." When asked about the impact of the British government's implementation of the export guarantee system on China on German-Chinese trade, Kriebel replied, "It will definitely affect the sales of German goods in China, but trade is free, and we will only watch this calmly."</p>
<h3>The Jingwei Railway Decides to Extend to Guixi; The Ministry of Railways and Eight Banks in Shanghai Borrow 14 Million Yuan; The Construction Bonds of the Jing-Gan Railway Are Used as Security; The Draft Contract Is to Be Officially Signed Immediately</h3>
<p>In order to complete the Southeast Railway Network, the Ministry of Railways decided to start construction of the main line of the Jing-Gan Railway. The budget for the entire line project is more than 50 million yuan, and it is planned to build it in sections. The first phase was originally scheduled to build the Jing-Qu section from Nanjing to Quzhou, Zhejiang. A reporter from Shenzhou News Agency learned from reliable sources in the banking community yesterday that the plan to build the Jing-Qu section first had some shortcomings from an economic standpoint, so it has been decided to extend it to Guixi, Jiangxi. The construction cost required for the Jing-Gui section is a total of 30 million yuan. In addition to the 8 million yuan that the Ministry of Railways has raised itself, and the 450,000 pounds borrowed from the Sino-British Gengkuan Association for fixed materials, Director Zhang Gongquan of the Ministry of Railways personally came to Shanghai a few days ago to discuss borrowing a huge amount of money with the Shanghai banking group. After several days of consultation, a specific agreement was announced yesterday. The main terms agreed upon by both parties are as follows: (1) The name is the Ministry of Railways' Jing-Gan Railway Jing-Gui Section Construction Loan. (2) The total amount of the loan is 14 million yuan. (3) The participating banks in the loan are the Bank of Communications, the Jin Cheng Bank, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, the China Farmers Bank, the Yanye Bank, the Zhongnan Bank, the Continental Bank, and the Four Bank Savings Associations. The loan allocation is 2 million yuan for Jin Cheng and 4 million yuan for Communications, and the remainder is shared by the other six banks. (2) The loan is secured by the 14 million yuan construction bonds of the Jing-Gan Railway recently approved by the Executive Yuan, and part of the remaining funds from the Yue-Han Railway. (4) The loan will be repaid in ten years. Both parties have agreed on all major items, and there is still a certain point regarding the repayment method that needs to be discussed and unified before it can be formally signed. The draft contract has been drafted, and once signed, the installments will be allocated from New Year's Day next year.</p>
<h3>Organizing National Social Organizations Should Apply to the Central Government for Permission; The Municipal Kuomintang Headquarters Will Notify All Sectors</h3>
<p>The first step in the procedures for organizing ordinary public organizations is to apply to the local Kuomintang Headquarters for a permit before preparations can begin. However, this type belongs to local organizations. If it belongs to a national one (such as the National Federation), it should apply to the Central Ministry of Civilian Training for permission to organize. It is heard that the Municipal Kuomintang Headquarters has received a notice from the Central Ministry of Civilian Training and will publish a notice in the newspaper to inform all sectors.</p>

<h3>South Africa Implements Harsh Regulations; Destroying the Business of Our Overseas Chinese; The National Petition Representatives Have Arrived in Shanghai; Will Go to Nanjing to Petition Our Authorities</h3>
<p>Shanghai Times News Agency reports that the local government in South Africa will implement harsh regulations from next year to destroy the business of our overseas Chinese and prohibit our overseas Chinese from importing goods. Special representatives Cen Xinyi and Liang Cizai have been sent back to the country to petition the government to negotiate and find a way to stop it, in order to save the 3 million pounds of capital of our local overseas Chinese businessmen who are on the verge of danger. Currently, Cen and Liang have arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, and after reporting to the Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau today, they will go to Nanjing on the 30th to meet with Foreign Minister Zhang and Chairman Chen Shuren of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee to make a request. The following is their report:</p>
<p>Report</p>
<p>The number of overseas Chinese living in South Africa is more than 3,000, all of whom are from Guangdong. Most of them make a living from grocery stores, clothing stores, vegetable gardens, etc. The time when overseas Chinese first came to Fiji was in 1885, and the harsh treatment of overseas Chinese by the government of Du Province in South Africa also began at the same time. The Du Provincial Government promulgated the Gold Law in 1885, prohibiting Asians and people of color from residing, doing business, and purchasing real estate in gold mining areas. It is illegal for overseas Chinese to reside, do business, and purchase real estate in the gold area. The official government has the right to order them to stop business and expel them at any time. All the prosperous cities in Du Province are located in gold mining areas. The prohibition of overseas Chinese from residing and doing business in the gold area is the prohibition of overseas Chinese from residing in all prosperous cities. This is the first oppression suffered by overseas Chinese. The Fiji Federal Government believes that the power of the Gold Law can only be implemented in gold mining areas, and cannot be implemented in other rural towns, so after the promulgation of the Gold Law, the</p>
<p>Private City Regulations</p>
<p>It is stipulated in the land contracts of various business owners that they must not lease or sell the business to Asians and people of color. In other words, Asians are not allowed to do business and reside in various cities, villages, and towns outside the gold area. Overseas Chinese are not allowed to reside and do business in the prosperous cities in the gold area, nor can they reside and do business in various rural towns. This is the second oppression suffered by overseas Chinese. Under the double oppression of the Gold Law and the Private City Regulations, overseas Chinese have long been unable to live. However, driven by the need to live, they have to desperately fight against the harsh environment, work hard to drill and operate in order to survive. It is suitable that the so-called Gold Law and Private City Law are not complete in legislation, so overseas Chinese can still survive. However, the Fiji Union continues to amend various harsh regulations in order to be rigorous, so lawsuits are frequent, and our overseas Chinese cannot bear the pain. In the past, the consular authorities also lacked the ability to lead, and did not know the standpoint of the country, and did not know that the goal of the Fiji Union's harsh regulations was not overseas Chinese, but</p>
<p>Indians</p>
<p>Every time they join the Indian United Front, follow in the footsteps of the Indians, and follow the trend of the Indians. How do they know that the position of China and India is different? They are domestic slaves, and we are independent and autonomous friendly countries. How can we be compared with Indians? Therefore, repeated decisions to resist harsh regulations will inevitably fail. The Fiji Federal Government, because of the joint front between Chinese and Indians, will increasingly impose all harsh regulations on overseas Chinese. Because it is not easy for the Fiji government to directly implement various harsh regulations, the Du Provincial Council passed the Business Management Law in 1926, granting the municipal governments and township bureaus of Du Province the full power to handle business licenses in various districts. The court shall not interfere with the municipal government or township bureau's ban on the business licenses of Asians, regardless of the reasons they hold. Those who are banned also have no right to appeal. Since the promulgation of the regulations, there have been many cases where the business licenses of Indians have been banned by the municipal government or township bureau for no reason, and there are also many cases where the business licenses of overseas Chinese have been banned for no reason. This is the third oppression suffered by overseas Chinese. Although the Fiji Federal Government has repeatedly amended the Huangyu Law, due to changes in the times or legal negligence, Asians can not only prolong their survival, but also increasingly reside and do business in the gold area. Therefore, in order to completely cut off the life of Asians forever, the Fiji government specifically proposed the Asian Tenancy Law in the Fiji Parliament in 1929. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Director Su Will Inspect the Shengsi Islands Today; Islanders Prepare to Welcome Him</h3>
<p>The Shengsi Islands, administered by Chongming County outside the Wusongkou, are located in the area where Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces meet, and are one of the richest fishing areas in Jiangsu Province.

<h3>Qingpu and Other Counties in Jiangsu Province Still Detaining Rice Boats; Rice Merchant Representatives Came to Shanghai for Assistance; Gu Xinyi and Others Requested the Municipal Government to Telegraph the Province for Release Yesterday; Rice Merchants from Beijing and Shanghai Will Hold a Meeting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Since the Executive Yuan passed the Sugar Regulation Measures, allowing free circulation within the country, the provinces and cities that had implemented the ban on grain exports have withdrawn this ban. However, recently, Qingpu and Jinshan counties in Jiangsu Province are still detaining more than 40 rice boats destined for Shanghai, causing significant losses to farmers and merchants.

<h3>Zhang Naiqi and Zou Taofen Were Taken to the Local Court Yesterday; Prosecutor Wang of the Local Court Personally Went to Transfer and Take Them Away; Xiang Sheng Motor Car Company Took Zhang and Zou Away</h3>
<p>Ms. Shi Liang, a female lawyer residing in the French Concession, economist Zhang Naiqi, and Zou Taofen, editor-in-chief of Life Weekly, were arrested on the night of the 22nd by the authorities ordering the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau to cooperate with the French police on suspicion of political activities and instigating labor unrest. The next day, they were transferred to the Higher Third Branch Court, where they were interrogated and ordered to be released on bail, all entrusted to defense lawyers to bail them out. On the 24th, the Higher Third Branch Court received a letter from the Public Security Bureau again, summoning the three defendants to appear in court. Shi did not appear because she had been bailed out, only Zhang and Zou complied with the summons and were detained. On the afternoon of the 25th, the court session was held. The French Police Department, finding no evidence of criminal activity by the defendants, submitted a report to the Higher Third Branch Court withdrawing the prosecution. As a result, the court revoked the ruling allowing bail and ordered the defendants to be transferred to the prosecutor for review, while ordering Shi Liang's defense lawyer to quickly find Shi to appear in court. However, Shi left Shanghai the morning after being bailed out, so as of 5 pm yesterday, she had not yet appeared in court. The police department dispatched detectives to Shi's residence and train and ferry terminals to guard and arrest her. According to reports, the Shanghai Local Court Procuratorate found that Zhang Naiqi and Zou Taofen had committed other acts of disrupting order, and yesterday prepared a document and sent Prosecutor Wang Jiawei with four bailiffs to the Higher Third Branch Court Procuratorate to request that Zhang and Zou be transferred and brought to justice. After receiving the document, the Higher Third Branch Court Procuratorate prepared a note and notified the Criminal Division of the same court. The Criminal Division then issued a notice and sent it to the bailiffs. Zhang Zhizhang, Sun Zuyi, and Xu Yin_, the defense lawyers of Zhang and Zou, arrived at the court at 4 pm. At 5 pm, Wang Jiawei, a prosecutor from the Shanghai Local Court, brought four bailiffs and arrived at the Higher Third Branch Court in two Xiang Sheng Motor Car Company cars to await the transfer. At 5:45 pm, Wu _ Qi, the chief of the Criminal Division, accompanied by two judges, Wang and Liao, and the _ prosecutor, led the secretary _ Lixiang to the Third Criminal Court. Lawyer _ Jiahuang still represented the French Police Department in court. The defense lawyers of the two defendants, Zhang and Zou, also appeared in court one after another, and the family members of the defendants also came to court to listen. Prosecutor Wang Jiawei of the Shanghai Local Court also led bailiffs to the court. Zhang and Zou were brought to the court from the detention center. After Judge Wu asked them questions separately, he cited the _ on the case transfer form from the Public Security Bureau and ruled that Zhang Naiqi and Zou Tao_ were to be taken into custody by Wang Jiawei, the prosecutor of the Shanghai Local Court, and the evidence was handed over together. After the ruling, Prosecutor Wang of the Local Court immediately wrote a receipt and attached it to the file. Zhang and Zou, together with the evidence, were taken down by the accompanying bailiffs and taken back to the Local Court in the original car for review.</p>

<h3>President of the Young Women's Christian Association Talks About Her Experience Attending the World Conference: India and Ceylon Are Very Unfamiliar with the Situation in China; She Gave Many Speeches Explaining Recent Progress</h3>
<p>Ms. Sun Wang Guoxiu, President of the National Association of the Young Women's Christian Association, attended the World YWCA Conference in Ceylon and returned to Shanghai on the Kang Tuo Russell _ ship the day before yesterday. A reporter from the New Sound News Agency interviewed her yesterday about the conference. According to her, the venues for this Regional Conference of the Young Women's Christian Association and the meeting of the Executive Committee of the World Young Women's Christian Association were in the two cities of Colombo and Kandy on the island of Ceylon in India. Representatives from a total of twenty-two countries attended. The Eastern countries included India, Burma, _ Luo, the Malay Archipelago, the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and China. The European and American countries included the United States, Britain, France, Italy, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Hungary, and others. The conference lasted for two weeks, from October 21st to November 6th. Every day, there were speeches and discussions on the status of women, the training of leaders of the Young Women's Christian Association, various international _ issues, the attitude that the Young Women's Christian Association should take towards international issues, and the explanation of the Christian significance of the Young Women's Christian Association, as well as discussions on the preparations for the World Young Women's Christian Association conference to be held in China in 1938. The representatives discussed and exchanged opinions with each other in a very sincere, open and honest manner, without any concealment or exaggeration. The Young Women's Christian Associations in various countries have different organizations and work due to the different situations in each place, but they all adhere to the purpose of serving society and benefiting mankind. In addition to myself, the Chinese representatives included Mrs. Guo _ Di and Ms. Cai Kui. India and Ceylon are very unfamiliar with the situation in China. I have given many speeches to explain to the people there the situation of various constructions and progress in China in recent years. After the conference, I took advantage of my spare time to travel around southern India to investigate the local customs and returned.</p>
<h3>The Local Court Will Try the Xuan Sheng Case Today; Nine Japanese People Have Been Summoned to Testify</h3>

<h3>Health Department Report: Dysentery and Malaria Sharply Reduced</h3>
<p>According to the Health Department of the Public Works Department's October report, dysentery and malaria have greatly decreased this month. Regarding malaria, although the number of reported cases in October was only half of September's, it was roughly the same as the same month last year. This shows that malaria in Shanghai has indeed become an important disease. Furthermore, the work of eradicating mosquitoes cannot be ignored. Even in this quarter, without the efforts of the authorities, malaria might not have decreased so rapidly in mid-October. In addition, the smallpox vaccination campaign began on October 1st and has been very smooth due to the mild weather. As many as 46,228 people were vaccinated this month, largely due to publicity efforts. Furthermore, respiratory infectious diseases and typhoid fever have slightly increased compared to September. Among foreign residents, 40 contracted typhoid fever, with 6 deaths. Among Chinese, 73 contracted the disease, with a staggering 59 deaths.</p>

<h3>Martin Case to be Tried</h3>
<p>The newly appointed US District Attorney to China, Mr. Shales, was delayed in San Francisco due to the American shipping strike and could not come to China to take office. He has now changed to a Japanese ship to Shanghai and is expected to arrive on December 15th. The case of American youth Martin, who had a dispute with a rickshaw puller, resulting in the rickshaw puller falling into the water and drowning, has not yet been tried due to Mr. Shales' delay in taking office. Currently, American lawyer Mr. Rogers is temporarily serving as the district attorney for this case, investigating the facts. He will soon be able to complete the investigation and submit a report to Chief Judge Hillmeck of the US Court. Therefore, the case can be tried after Mr. Shales arrives.</p>
<h3>New World Hangs French Flag, Qiu Peilin Sentenced to One Year for Intending to Harm Creditors' Rights, Judged by the First Special Court</h3>
<p>Qiu Peilin, a large merchant from Zhejiang and business partner of Wu Yu Ren, lived at 4 Yu Qiaqing Road. He previously leased the land of the New World Amusement Park on Jing'an Temple Road from real estate tycoon Cheng Linsheng. When the lease expired, Cheng filed a lawsuit against Qiu for lease termination and eviction. As a result, Qiu was dared to sue by a confirmed judgment. When the case was enforced, Qiu suddenly hung a French flag on the roof of the amusement park, preventing the court from carrying out the enforcement. Qiu's action was clearly intended to damage creditors' rights, so the legal department of the Public Works Department filed a public prosecution against Qiu in the First Special Court under Article 356 of the Criminal Law for the crime of damaging creditors' rights. Because Qiu could not be served with a summons, the court issued an arrest warrant, which has been outstanding for nearly a year, but Qiu has never been arrested. Recently, Qiu suddenly commissioned a lawyer to send a letter to the legal department of the Public Works Department, stating that he had left Shanghai due to illness and had now recovered. Having heard of the court's arrest warrant, he intended to surrender himself. The department ordered him to surrender to the Xin Zha police station in charge. Qiu complied and surrendered. He was escorted to the First Special District Court. Because the case file had to be retrieved, Qiu was allowed to post bail and be released pending a new hearing date. Yesterday morning, Judge Pan Zhenyang continued the hearing in the Second Criminal Division. Qiu Peilin and his defense lawyer argued that Qiu was not in Shanghai when the incident occurred, so he did not know who hung the flag. Furthermore, the collection of rent was handled by the Yuanji rental agency and sometimes by the French businessman Bairenlong rental agency, so the incident may have been due to a misunderstanding by Bairenlong. They requested a declaration of innocence. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu argued that Qiu's actions constituted the crime of damaging creditors' rights under the criminal law and should be punished accordingly. Judge Pan declared that Qiu Peilin, at the time of being subject to compulsory execution, intended to harm the rights of creditors by disposing of his property and sentenced him to one year in prison. Qiu should be taken into custody immediately.</p>
<h3>Osaka Wharf Cracks Down on Trafficking Case, Three Children Rescued</h3>
<p>Two women, Wang Li and Chen Ye, carried three boys to the Yangshupu Osaka Wharf at 1:20 PM the day before yesterday to board the Shengying Jiuri Wheel to Fujian Province, intending to sell the children for profit. A patrol leader at the wharf, Chen Yunfang from Shandong, noticed something amiss and questioned the two women, who gave evasive answers. He immediately reported to the Huishan police station. Chinese Detective Cai Liu and Detective Xu Shutian arrived and took Wang, Chen, and the children to the police station. Wang Li confessed that she had met Wang Afu, who is on the run, two weeks ago. The six-year-old boy, Xiaomao, was born to Wang Afu and his wife, who recently passed away. Therefore, she took the child to a small house at No. 5, Lane 70, Caishi Road in the French Concession for temporary lodging. She was instructed to send the child to Fuzhou. Chen Ye confessed that the five-year-old girl, Lin Nannv, and a boy named Yao of the same age, were brought by her lover, named Xiao Wang, who lives at No. 131, Avenue du Père-Robert, in the French Concession. She and Wang Li were waiting at the wharf. Wang Afu then brought the children, bought the tickets, and gave them 20 yuan to send them to a certain place in Fuzhou. Chinese and Western detectives from the police station rushed to No. 5, Caishi Road, and No. 131, Avenue du Père-Robert, in the French Concession to arrest Wang Afu and Xiao Wang, but both had fled. Yesterday morning, Wang Li and Chen Ye were sent to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Public Works Department lawyer Zhang Shizhu explained the case, stating that the three trafficked children could not state where they lived, and the victims could not be investigated. He requested an adjournment, and the three children were temporarily sent to the Women and Children's Relief Society. Patrol leader Chen Yunfang then testified about the incident. When questioned, the two women gave evasive answers, claiming that they did not know where their lovers had kidnapped the children. They pleaded for mercy. The three boys could not provide detailed information about their homes. Judge Xiao Xiehuan ordered them to be remanded in custody for further investigation. The three children were allowed to be temporarily sent to the Women and Children's Relief Society for care.</p>

<h3>Strong Northerly Winds Howl Last Night, Local Climate Freezing</h3>
<p>This morning in Shanghai, there was a heavy fog. After the fog dissipated, the weather became extremely warm, with the temperature rising to 69.8 degrees. However, at 7 PM, strong northerly winds suddenly howled, whistling through cracks in windows and eaves. Roof tiles were blown off, and pedestrians on the road hurried along, holding their heads and hats. The climate was freezing, with the temperature dropping sharply to over 30 degrees, a difference of a whole season compared to the morning. This morning, the wind has subsided slightly, but the cold is like that of a severe winter. The west wind sweeps across the face, chilling to the bone. However, the weather is clear, making the winter day quite lovely.</p>
<h3>Woman Nie Guizhi Accuses Xi Laichun of Taking Concubines Like Eating Vegetables, Claims Xi Likes to Smell and Knead Women's Small Feet, Verdict: Not Guilty, Civil Suit Dismissed</h3>
<p>Xi Laichun, a wealthy merchant from Hangzhou living in Shanghai, is 70 years old. Recently, Nie Guizhi, a woman from Yushan, Jiangxi, hired a lawyer and filed a criminal complaint against Xi in the First Special Court for violating Article 293, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, and filed an ancillary civil suit, requesting a judgment ordering the payment of 36,000 yuan in living expenses. The court had scheduled two hearings, but because the defendant had not arrived and the summons had not been legally served, the hearing was postponed. This was reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Risheng continued the hearing in the Eighth Criminal Division. The defendant was still not present, but his lawyer appeared in court, stating that the defendant was currently recuperating in Qingdao and that the summons had been forwarded to Qingdao by his family, so he could not arrive today. Judge Huang stated that since the summons had been legally served, the case should proceed. The plaintiff, Nie Guizhi, 30 years old, stated that she had gone to Hangzhou from Jiangxi to escape the war two years ago and met the defendant Xi Laichun. They began living together on November 14th of that year. After marrying the defendant as his fourth concubine, she came to Shanghai with him and lived at No. 30, Jishan Lane, East-West Huade Road, until April 25th of this year. When she sent her mother back to Jiangxi, she returned to Shanghai on June 8th and was refused entry. She does not know the reason. The defendant is addicted to sex and likes the new and dislikes the old, like eating side dishes. He likes novelty. On August 14th of last year, two other women were abandoned. After I became the defendant's concubine, I was repeatedly abused. After being abandoned, I had no means of support and had to pawn my belongings to make a living. I have attempted suicide several times. The defendant has a peculiar habit: he likes to smell and knead small feet. Because he saw that I had bound feet, he took me as his concubine. I request that he be ordered to appear in court and punished according to the law. The defendant's lawyer stated that the plaintiff was a maid in the defendant's house and that it was not known in what capacity she was filing the lawsuit. Therefore, the plaintiff's identity was unclear and he requested a verdict of not guilty. The court declared the debate in this case concluded and ruled that Xi Laichun was not guilty. The plaintiff's ancillary civil suit was dismissed.</p>
<h3>Circumcision Leads to Death, Fake Doctor Sentenced, Xuan Zhongfu Sentenced to Eight Months</h3>
<p>Xuan Zhongnan, a native of Wuxi who previously worked as a nurse at Baolong Hospital, left the hospital before completing his apprenticeship and set up a clinic at No. 533, Baker Road, calling himself a doctor. On the 28th of last month, Ni Jintang, a shop employee from the Tianhe Dyeing Workshop on North Zhejiang Road, went to Xuan Zhongfu for a circumcision because he suffered from phimosis. Xuan injected pantocaine anesthetic. Unexpectedly, due to the excessive dosage, Ni Jintang lost consciousness. He was given a cardiac stimulant, but it was ineffective. He was sent to Baolong Hospital, but he died on the way. The hospital reported to the police station, which sent detectives to take the body to the mortuary. The autopsy revealed that he died of drug poisoning. Xuan Zhongfu, along with four assistants who were present - Shao Jun, Qiu Shouzhong, and Tian Qixiong - were escorted to the First Special Court. According to the forensic report, the dosage of pantocaine anesthetic should be one part per thousand, and a vasoconstrictor (adrenaline) should be added. However, the defendant lacked medical knowledge and mistakenly used one part per hundred, leading to the incident. However, the defendant's lawyer presented a bottle of pantocaine in court, stating that the bottle stated that two parts per hundred could be used. The court determined that this point required further investigation and ordered the four defendants to each post a bail of 1,000 yuan pending a new hearing date. Yesterday morning, Judge Fu Lin continued the hearing in the Eighth Criminal Division. Defendants Shao Jun and Qiu Shouzhong hired lawyer Fan Gang. Xuan Zhongfu and Tian Qixiong hired lawyer Li Baosen, who appeared in court to defend them. First, Judge Fu announced that during the adjournment, the court had inquired with the forensic department about the dosage of the drug. According to the reports of forensic doctors Wei and Zhang, the dosage of pantocaine injection should be one part per thousand and should be mixed with epinephrine to avoid poisoning. The two parts per hundred stated on the bottle was for external use. The judge then had the report distributed to the lawyers for both sides to read. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang and the defendants' lawyers Fan and Li debated the matter. The court ruled that Xuan Zhongfu caused the death of another person due to professional negligence and sentenced him to eight months in prison. Tian Qixiong was sentenced to two months in prison for helping another person cause the death of another person due to professional negligence, with a two-year suspended sentence. Shao Jun was found guilty of attempted fraud and fined 30 yuan. Qiu Shouzhong was acquitted and released. Xuan, Shao, and Tian were allowed to remain on their original bail pending appeal, otherwise they would be taken into custody.</p>

<h3>Public Works Department Retrenchment Committee Recommends General Salary Cuts (Continued)</h3>
<p>"P" Grade Staff</p>
<p>"P" grade staff is a new grade proposed by the committee. All "P" grade staff will be young people who have graduated from local schools in this city and are under the age of 21, with those who have a slight understanding of Chinese being considered qualified. They will not enjoy the benefits of exchange rate adjustments, and their length of service will not be counted towards retirement conditions or long holiday benefits. However, they will be entitled to the benefits of a Provident Fund, with both the staff member and the PWD contributing 5% each. After three years of service or upon reaching adulthood, "P" grade staff may be promoted to "B" grade or "L" grade based on their qualifications to continue serving. Those promoted to "B" grade will receive the same initial salary as "L" grade. "P" grade staff will be entitled to two weeks of short leave each year.</p>
<p>Implementation of New Regulations</p>
<p>The implementation of these new regulations will take effect six months after notification for all staff with employment contracts, except for "A" grade staff or foreign-appointed "L" grade staff whose terms are three years. The PWD may consider allowing staff who do not wish to work under the new regulations and who are less than two years away from retirement to retire early, deducting 1% of their pension for each year of service not completed.</p>
<p>Japanese Police Officers</p>
<p>Japanese officers in the Police Force generally receive the same benefits as British officers, such as exchange rate compensation, except for a slightly lower initial salary. Therefore, the impact of the new regulations will be the same as for other British officers in the Police Force. The general method will be to incorporate the exchange rate loss into the original salary and deduct 8%. They will not be entitled to repatriation pay within the first nine years of service. Rent must be paid as usual. Various allowances will not be subject to exchange rate adjustments. The regulations for long leave, medical care, Provident Fund, and pensions will be the same as for other foreign staff. Furthermore, the treatment of Indian officers in the Police Force and White Russian members of the Volunteer Corps will also be slightly altered. Details are omitted here.</p>
<p>Treatment of Chinese Staff</p>
<p>The Personnel Reduction Committee's report contains the following statement regarding the treatment of Chinese staff in the Public Works Department without employment contracts: "We deeply feel that in principle, no group of PWD staff should be exempt from the burden of the reduction measures we advocate. At the same time, we also feel that lower-level Chinese staff cannot be subjected to the same salary reduction measures as other staff. However, we propose that there should be no further promotions or salary increases for Chinese staff in 1937, and this proposal should be effective from January 1, 1937. Therefore, Chinese staff will not be affected by the salary reduction, except for those whose salaries have reached the maximum level for their grade and exceed 100 yuan or more. Regarding these staff (referring to those whose salaries have reached the maximum level and exceed 100 yuan), we propose a salary reduction equal to the amount that would be added to their salary under the new fixed salary increase system for their grade. If we do not propose this salary reduction, these staff will not be affected by our proposals. We further propose that the system of activity-based salary increases for Chinese staff should also be abolished at the same time as for foreign staff. In the future, the Board of Directors should adopt a new salary grade system for all Chinese staff without employment contracts. This new grade system is described in the appendix to this report, in which the maximum salary has been reduced by 8%, but the minimum salary for each grade below 50 yuan has not been changed. For each grade with a minimum salary between 50 yuan and 99 yuan, it must be reduced by 4%. For each grade with a minimum salary of 100 yuan or more, it must be reduced by 8%. Furthermore, according to the existing salary grade system, the salaries of some more senior staff increase every three years. We now stipulate that all salaries will increase annually. To ensure that lower-level Chinese staff receive the same treatment, all staff who are currently on a three-year salary increase system should serve one additional year before being promoted or receiving a salary increase. In addition, we propose that the Provident Fund granted by the PWD to Chinese staff should be the same as for foreign staff, reducing from 10% to 5% in the first five years. All Chinese staff should also pay the Municipal General Rate and Property Tax."</p>
<p>Financial Impact</p>
<p>According to a report from the Acting Treasurer of the Finance Office, if the Retrenchment Committee's recommendations are adopted by the Board of Directors, it will save 1,060,000 yuan in one year, including 657,000 yuan in salaries for foreign staff, 156,000 yuan for Chinese staff, 50,000 yuan for Japanese police officers, 26,000 yuan for Indian police officers, 7,000 yuan for the White Russian Volunteer Corps, 10,000 yuan from the Municipal General Rate, 34,000 yuan in long leave allowances and exchange rate compensation, 25,000 yuan in medical and special treatment expenses, and 15,000 yuan in Provident Fund and interest. In addition to the above, the delayed salary increase process, the reduced Provident Fund granted by the PWD to new staff within five years of joining, the exemption of exchange rate losses on Provident Fund interest, and the restriction on exchange rate losses on pensions will all make the PWD's finances increasingly economical. It is difficult to predict the exact amount that can be saved annually, but it will certainly be considerable. Furthermore, although the exchange rate risk for Provident Fund and pensions can be largely eliminated in the future, the Retrenchment Committee believes that the PWD should establish a separate fund to cope with ongoing exchange rate risks in the future when its finances are slightly better.</p>
<p>Conclusion of the Report</p>
<p>The report concludes: "We respectfully submit this report, hoping that the Board of Directors will consider the interests of taxpayers and implement effective retrenchment, and that staff will faithfully support this move. Furthermore, we should declare that when considering this matter, we have not only considered the importance of reducing government spending, but also the effectiveness of PWD services." Signed by Franklin, Keswick, and Mitchell. (The End)</p>
<h3>Exchanging Post-Dated Checks That Bounce, Fraud Case Hearing Continues, Complex Case with Unusual Disputes, Yang Yisun Released on Bail by Lawyer</h3>
<p>Yang Yisun, a shareholder of Jinlong Cotton Mill, and Wu Jiamo, the general manager of the mill, exchanged post-dated checks to Huang Wanshou and Pan Xingcheng, and pawned the mill's goods for loans. Wu Jiamo then fled. Yang Yisun claimed that the checks were forged by Wu in collusion with Qin Dedang and Chen Zhengrong, and that the goods were stolen by them. He reported to the Chinese and foreign police authorities, requesting an investigation. Later, the Public Concession Police arrested Qin and sent him to the First Special District Court, where he was acquitted. The case is currently on appeal. Chen Zhengrong was arrested by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau and sent to the Shanghai Local Court, where he is currently under investigation. Qin, Chen, Huang Wanshou, and Pan Xingcheng then filed criminal self-suits in the First Special District Court against Yang Yisun and Chen Shida, the manager of Jinlong, for fraud, false accusation, and abuse of checks. Yang Yisun then filed counterclaims against the plaintiffs for false accusation. This case is complex and involves unusual disputes. The First Special Court has held several hearings, ordering each person to submit handwriting samples for forensic analysis before resuming the hearing. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhong Qing continued the hearing. After taking his seat, Judge Zhong announced that the forensic institute's report on the handwriting analysis had not yet arrived, so the hearing could not be concluded. When questioning Yang Yisun, he stated that the Chen Zhengrong case was still under investigation in the Shanghai Local Court. He had not opened a room at the Yangzi Hotel to discuss the checks with Huang. The checks were not issued by him. He was previously the sales director in the business department of China Oil Lamp Company, and he only worked at the mill initially before being transferred to the company for only 18 days before being dismissed. Chen Chaojun, the plaintiffs' lawyer, presented a letter from the general manager of China Oil Lamp Company, proving that Yang did not work at the company. Another plaintiffs' lawyer stated that the prosecutor of the Shanghai Local Court had now discovered that Yang Yisun was suspected of false accusation and had begun an investigation ex officio. He requested that the case file be reviewed to clarify the matter. The court then questioned Huang Wanshou and Chen Zhengrong separately. Yang Yisun and Wu Jiamo opened room 327 at the Yangzi Hotel on the evening of the 12th of last month to discuss the exchange of the post-dated checks. Huang and Chen both claimed that Yang had asked them to maintain the checks at the time and was willing to use his wife's passbook as collateral. When questioned, Yang vehemently denied this. Judge Zhong then ordered Yang to write a handwriting sample in court for comparison and adjourned the hearing. Yang Yisun was released on bail by his lawyer, Sun Biwu.</p>
<h3>Mortality Statistics for Public Concession Residents Last Month</h3>
<p>Regarding the mortality statistics for Public Concession residents in October, according to a report from the Director of the Health Department, only 87 foreign infants were born this month, accounting for 2.75 per thousand. In previous months, the number was around 24.77 per thousand. Of this number, 72 were born within the Public Concession, including 42 male infants and 30 female infants. There are no accurate statistics on the number of Chinese infants born, but because the smallpox vaccination program has begun this month, the number of infants reported to the Health Department for registration after birth has also increased sharply, exceeding 2,000 compared to September. The total number reported was 2,837, including 2,762 residing in the Public Concession, of which 1,500 were male infants and 1,262 were female infants. Forty-three foreign residents died this month, of which 74% were non-Chinese Asians, accounting for 13.15 per thousand of the total population. The causes of death were typhoid fever, tuberculosis, diarrhea, dysentery, infant diseases, and tumors. Chinese deaths accounted for 15.66 per thousand. The leading causes of death were old age, tuberculosis, typhoid fever, bronchitis, and heart disease.</p>

<h3>En Route from Shanghai to Yingkou, the "Pingshun" Runs Aground: Ship Strikes Reef near Lushun Port, Water Entering Compartments, Rescue Efforts Underway</h3>
<p>The "Pingshun" steamer of the Datongxing Shipping Company of this port, with a deadweight of 1,584 tons, registered at 886 tons, length 252 feet, width 38 feet, depth 21 feet 9 inches, and horsepower 800, with a speed of 10.25 nautical miles per hour, was built in Germany in 1908. On the 25th of this month, due to a large quantity of miscellaneous grains and soybeans awaiting loading in Yingkou, and with Niuzhuang about to freeze over, the ship departed from Shanghai empty, intending to load goods and unload them in Shanghai. On the 27th (yesterday) at 1:00 AM, the ship arrived at Lushun Port and encountered</p>
<p>Strong Winds</p>
<p>The winds were extremely strong, and the waves they stirred up were particularly turbulent. The "Pingshun" struggled mightily in the violent storm, but due to being empty, it could not withstand the impact of the wind and waves, and was blown adrift by the strong winds and waves. The ship was blown directly onto the rocks outside Lushun Port and ran aground. It was immediately unable to move. After the accident, the shipowner immediately telegraphed the Yingkou and Dalian branches for help. After seven hours, the tide receded, and the "Pingshun" was found high aground on the rocks. The shipowner's survey revealed that</p>
<p>Two Compartments Damaged</p>
<p>These were the fire compartments in the engine room, both of which had been flooded. The situation was extremely dangerous. Yesterday afternoon, a telegram was also received in Shanghai, stating: "This morning (27th), the 'Pingshun' ran aground outside Lushun Port due to wind. After the tide receded at 8:30 AM, the ship was aground on the rocks. The fire compartments, etc., have been flooded, and the situation is extremely dangerous. We have telegraphed Yingkou and Dalian for help," and so on. Upon receiving the news, this newspaper's reporter immediately inquired at various locations. Initially, the company planned to hire the large tugboat of Laisi Shipping Company in Shanghai to</p>
<p>Rush to the Rescue</p>
<p>After consulting with Director Tang of the China Ship Insurance United Association, etc., it was generally agreed that sending a ship from Shanghai for rescue was too far, and it would take more than two days to reach Lushun, which was not a suitable emergency measure. Therefore, the decision was changed to telegraph Dalian, requesting the branch company to send a ship from nearby Dalian to rush to the rescue, to facilitate the matter. The reporter then went to the company to inquire. According to them, the sea was not yet calm, and a ship could likely be sent from Dalian to Lushun today for rescue. However, the ship was in great danger. Fortunately, it had not yet been loaded with cargo, so the loss was relatively light. As for the entire crew and sailors, they were all safe.</p>

<h3>International Problems Research Association Welcomes Returning Representatives: Zhang Pengchun and Others Give Incisive Speeches</h3>
<p>The International Problems Research Association held a tea party at the Hong Kong Road Bank Club at 5:00 PM yesterday to welcome Zhang Pengchun, Zhu Youyu, Li Gan, Liu Yuwan, Luo Chuanhua, Shi Boqun, Shen Kun'er, and others, representatives of China who recently attended the Sixth Pacific International Studies Conference. Except for Mr. Shen, who was unable to attend due to business, those present included Zhang Pengchun, Zhu Youyu, Li Gan, Liu Yuwan, Luo Chuanhua, Shi Boqun, Guo Bingwen, Li Zhaohuan, Wu Liande, Liu Zhanen, Shen Xinqing, Zhu Shaoping, Lin Kanghou, Chen Zhi, Tu Chuyu, Zhao Shutong, Huang Tingying, Dai Baoliu, and others. The meeting was chaired by Guo Bingwen, Chairman of the Association, who gave a welcome speech, stating that the representatives of China who attended the Pacific International Studies Conference had achieved outstanding results and have now returned to Shanghai one after another. This association is holding this meeting to welcome them, express our condolences, and invite the representatives to report on the conference and their travel experiences for the association to learn from. Zhang Pengchun then gave a speech on the attitude of British and French representatives at the Pacific International Studies Conference. Zhu Youyu gave a speech on the organization and position of the Japanese delegation. Liu Yuwan gave a speech on his observations of Russia. Luo Chuanhua gave a speech on the situation of overseas Chinese. Li Gan and Shi Boqun gave speeches on their thoughts on attending the conference. The meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM. The speeches are summarized below:</p>
<p>Zhang Pengchun's speech: In brief, the attitudes of the British and French representatives at this Pacific International Studies Conference are worthy of our attention and research. (1) The British representatives were well-prepared in advance, so their statements were quite organized and consistent, which is worth learning from. However, the British people previously had a rather mistaken understanding of Eastern issues, believing that Japan's activities in China would not become extremely恶化and that Japan would be satisfied if the puppet state was recognized. However, after the conference, the British people deeply realized that Japan's ambitions were not small and that it directly intended to engulf East Asia. (2) The French representatives initially had no specific understanding of Eastern issues, but they paid attention to (A) the inseparable integrity of world peace and (B) the principle of maintaining a collective security system. These were highly valued by various countries at the conference.</p>
<p>Zhu Youyu's speech: In brief, the conference was attended by 16 representatives from China and 15 representatives from Japan. Their positions were different. The Chinese representatives took a purely academic position, and their statements were made for justice. The Japanese representatives, such as Yoshizawa, Kanai Kiyoshi, and Sakatani, were all well-known figures in the Japanese political world in the past. Their speeches were biased toward the government and contained many distortions. They expressed regret that the progress of Japan's foreign trade had been opposed by various countries. The representatives of various countries believed that the reason why Japanese goods were viewed with jealousy was due to (A) improper sales methods, such as smuggling in China, etc., and (B) the use of force to seize markets, etc.</p>
<p>Liu Yuwan's speech: In brief, I passed through Soviet Russia on my way back to China. (1) Soviet Russia showed tension in all aspects, without any slackness. The reason is that Japan and Germany are entrenched in the East and West, while Britain and France are also watching from the side. (2) Traveling in Russia is not very free. Groups represent everything everywhere, and individuals are not free. (3) Soviet Russia's production and consumption agencies are controlled by the government. Although the "card system" for living needs has now been cancelled, there are still considerable restrictions on the actual quantity needed. (4) Wages are high for those with specialized technical intelligence. The wages of foremen are lower than those of skilled workers. Wages are distributed according to performance. The government hires a large number of experts to carefully create work standards for various departments for reference. (5) Agriculture is collective farming. The machines used belong to the public. The income from agricultural products is partly returned to the government, partly to the society, partly to the machinery aspect, and partly to the individual.</p>
<p>Shi Boqun's speech: In brief, the Pacific International Studies Conference did not actually have any concrete results, because the conference is an academic organization, not a government organization. After attending the conference, I personally felt that the existing diplomatic mechanism is not sufficient to cope with the current complex situation, because diplomacy must have strength as its backing. Otherwise, empty words will not help. However, when passing through various countries on the way back to China, public opinion in various countries unanimously expressed sympathy for China's self-reliance and renewal, which is gratifying.</p>
<p>Luo Chuanhua's speech: In brief, I visited 21 places during this trip abroad. After briefly examining the situation of overseas Chinese in various places, I found three advantages that are worth praising: (1) The high degree of development of patriotic enthusiasm, (2) The effort to manage public undertakings, and (3) A wealth of fighting spirit, which can all be models for the people of the country.</p>
<p>Li Gan's speech: In brief, I have some thoughts on attending this conference, that is, international propaganda is very important, but factual performance is even more important. If there is good construction in domestic politics and economy, and it is shown to the world, then international criticism will naturally improve. For example, the rural construction and new currency and government documents proposed by our country's representatives this time were highly valued by various countries.</p>
<h3>China Farmers Bank Joins the Check Clearing House, Designated as Number 41</h3>
<p>The Check Clearing House affiliated to the Joint Reserve Committee of the Shanghai Banking Industry Association has achieved good results since its establishment on January 10, 1933. Since the Central Bank joined the clearing and collected the bills of money shops, the total amount of daily clearing has increased sharply. Now, the Shanghai Branch of the China Farmers Bank has also decided to join, designated as Number 41. A notice has been issued and all banks have been notified. The notice states: "To Whom It May Concern: We have received a letter from the China Farmers Bank, stating that it wishes to join this association as a clearing bank to fill the vacancy of the Jiangzhe Bank, etc. After investigation, the bank was originally represented by this association for clearing, and the amount of its bill receipts and payments was particularly large. Now, the Check Clearing House Committee and the Executive Committee of this association have resolved to approve the bank's joining as a clearing bank, starting from December 1 of this year, and the clearing house number of the bank has been designated as Number 41. This notice is hereby issued for your information."</p>

<h3>Various Groups Host a Farewell Banquet for Young Master Yang: Commander Yang and Over 500 Others</h3>
<p>Yang Anguo, the son of Yang Hu, Commander of the Songhu Garrison, was previously sent by Chairman Chiang to study in Germany. He has now completed his studies and returned to China, arriving in Shanghai on the morning of the 24th.

<h3>Chen Guohua's Divorced Wife Sues for Alimony</h3>
<p>Chen Guohua, a Cantonese man residing at No. 38, Xinhua First Village, Xinhua Road, French Concession, is in his prime. His father, Chen Lixing, was a compradore at Yuanchang Huahang, No. 349 Jiangxi Road. After his father's death, Chen inherited his father's position and had a considerable income. He married Tang Deyi (41 years old this year), a woman from Zhongshan, his hometown, who now lives on the third floor of No. 846, North Sichuan Road. They have been married for over 20 years and have two sons and four daughters. Chen is by nature licentious and often associates with foreign women. In 1931, Chen took advantage of his wife's trip to Hong Kong to mediate with her brother-in-law and demand the return of over 100,000 yuan in loans. He actually filed a lawsuit with the court, requesting a divorce from his wife, claiming that his wife did not abide by the duties of a woman. He used the fact that his wife was in Hong Kong to obtain a judgment through default service of process. Later, when Chen's wife returned to Shanghai and learned of this, she questioned Chen. Chen regretted it again, and filed another lawsuit with the court to withdraw the divorce suit, and paid Tang 120 yuan in living expenses every month. However, Chen still did not go to Tang's residence, and ordered his children not to meet their mother. Recently, Chen has been cohabiting with a woman surnamed Cai, and has been in arrears with the living expenses of his wife and children since the end of August of this year. Chen Tang Deyi had no choice but to hire a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the Special Second Court, requesting cohabitation with Chen Guohua and alimony. Because mediation failed, she formally filed a lawsuit. Yesterday morning, Judge Li Liang summoned both parties to the seventh civil division. Both parties arrived with lawyers. According to the plaintiff's request, the defendant Chen Guohua was ordered to cohabitate and pay the plaintiff and his children 1,980 yuan owed before the end of August of this year, and 240 yuan per month starting from September of this year. It was also stated that the defendant's licentiousness would not be announced for the time being. The defendant also locked the children at home and did not allow them to meet their mother, and submitted the letters from the children to the plaintiff as evidence. The defendant denied the facts alleged by the plaintiff in his defense. After both lawyers debated, the court announced the conclusion and scheduled the judgment for the 30th.</p>

<h3>Dr. Chen Bangdian's Special "X Needle" Injection to Quit Smoking: Free Trial Before Quitting</h3>
<p>Dr. Chen Bangdian, a medical doctor who studied in the United States, sympathizes with the suffering of those trapped in the darkness of addiction. He has specially formulated a kind of needle medicine that is the opposite of opium. It completely uses advanced scientific methods and has extraordinary effects. Because it is a special preparation, it does not have a corresponding name, so it is called the "X Needle." Whether it is a new addiction, an old addiction, a big addiction, a small addiction, or a weak and sick body, it can be completely quit. It is very different from general preparations that still use opium as the main raw material. When first injected, you can smoke and work as usual. After a few injections, you can see that you naturally hate smoking. The amount of smoking gradually decreases, even to nothing. There is no reaction in between, and there is no pain. Many people are now using this method to quit. Details can be obtained from Dr. Chen's clinic, Room 402, 4th Floor, Wuzhou Pharmacy Building, Fuzhou Road. Dr. Chen offers a free trial to save smokers from their suffering. Those who are trapped in darkness and want to escape from the sea of ​​misery should not miss this opportunity.</p>
<h3>Du Yuwang and Others Discussed Yesterday: Coordination of Tongyi Company, Du Yuwang and Others Exert Efforts to Mediate, Creditor Representatives Unanimously Approve</h3>
<p>After the Tongyi Trust Company went bankrupt this year, half a year has passed without any progress. Now, Du Yuesheng, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaoxiang, and others are conducting coordination to prepare for resumption of business (as reported in yesterday's newspaper). On the evening of the 26th, at Yizhi Xiang on Fourth Road, they invited various creditors and agents to discuss the coordination plan. Over 80 guests from Shanghai, Pingzhou, and other places attended. Mr. Wang specially rushed back from Suiyuan to attend. First, Mr. Yu Qiaqing gave a speech, explaining the coordination plan. Then, Mr. Du explained it again, stating that for the sake of the legal rights of all creditors, he was responsible for conducting coordination in order to resolve the matter as soon as possible. After the speech, the representatives spoke, expressing their deep agreement with and acceptance of the proposals of Du, Yu, and Wang. They stated that after investigating the company's accounts, the directors and supervisors of Tongyi had not found any personal losses, and that the method proposed by the mediators of 10% for the savings department, 100% for the trust department, and 50% for the bank department (as detailed in the 26th newspaper) was unprecedented for financial institutions that had closed down in the past. It is believed that the creditors' meeting on the 6th of next month will yield satisfactory results, and they will persuade all creditors to actively participate.</p>
<h3>Ji Ren Chinese Medicine Hospital to Open Tomorrow: Wang Yiting Unveils Plaque, Chu Minyi Presents Certificates</h3>
<p>The Ji Ren Chinese Medicine Hospital, founded by the Shanghai Ji Ren Association, will officially open on the 29th of this month. At 10:00 AM, Mr. Wang Yiting will be invited to hold the plaque unveiling ceremony, and the chairman of the board, Chu Minyi, will personally present certificates and badges to the physicians, demonstrating seriousness. The declaration of the association is recorded below: This association has been established for nearly 20 years, and has focused on helping with burial materials with the meager contributions of colleagues. The motive for establishing the Ji Ren Chinese Medicine Hospital this time is based on the actual investigation during the distribution of burial materials, which revealed that most of the dead suffered from diseases that were not incurable, but died because they could not afford medical treatment. They are also human beings, also living beings, not even as good as the dogs and horses of rich families. In such a prosperous Shanghai, this is definitely beyond what we usually dream of. Many famous national doctors are members of this association. They all believe that since the association passively assists with burial materials after death, it is better to actively provide diagnosis and treatment before death. When the Renzi group of this association held its establishment meeting on July 12, the proposal was discussed. With the enthusiastic support of all members, it was unanimously decided to hire specialists and prepare for the opening as soon as possible. It was also noted that impoverished patients often cannot get out of bed to go to the hospital for treatment of serious illnesses, and they lack the funds to hire a doctor. Charitable hospitals in various places do not have free outpatient services, and the fees for doctors to visit patients in Shanghai are expensive. The emergency and difficult situation is beyond what can be saved by providing diagnosis and treatment within the hospital. In order to remedy this shortcoming, it is necessary to hold free outpatient services as an exception to meet the needs of the community. Therefore, the regulations for free outpatient services were specially formulated, and introduction cards for free outpatient services were printed and distributed to the members of this association for issuance at any time. It is now decided to open on November 29 of the Gregorian calendar, providing diagnosis and medicine to benefit the poor and sick. However, colleagues are willing to do their best, and it is hoped that people from all walks of life will give guidance and support, so that the hospital can cure more patients, and the charitable associations can help fewer in the future with burial materials. Cause and effect circulate, and rewards are certain. Rebirth of the dead and fleshy bones are immeasurable merits. Sincerely, please be aware. (This hospital will never send anyone to solicit donations from outside, which is hereby attached). Chairman Chu Minyi, directors Yan Erling, Wang Zikang, Nong Ruhui, Dai Chunfeng, hospital director Shao Ruxin, medical director Wang Xingsheng, Ren Nongxuan, 18 physicians from various departments. Hospital address: No. 6, Dakangfang, Bair Road, north of Taiping Bridge, French Concession, telephone 84532.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor, I recently heard that Mr. Wu Wentian requested leave to come to Shanghai to handle personal affairs. I recently read in your newspaper a news item entitled "Wu Wentian Returns to Beijing to Report for Duty," the content of which is completely untrue. I hereby solemnly declare this and request that this letter be published to correct the record. Thank you very much. Sincerely, Wu Wentian, November 27, 1936.</p>

<h3>The Enamel Industry in Shanghai (Continued) (An Overview of Shanghai Industry and Commerce, No. 38)</h3>
<p>— China WeChat Editor</p>
<p>60-70% of the products produced by local factories are sold in Shanghai, with the rest mainly sold in the Yangtze River basin, and very few in South China and Southeast Asia. At the same time, almost all of the products sold are from small factories in this city, because they sell at reduced prices and are easily welcomed by customers. When ordinary factories promote their goods to other places, they generally wholesale at a 9.75% discount. If there is competition from foreign goods in that place, the factories can wholesale at a 9.5% discount. The payment must be made in cash or with a ten-day bank draft, and long-term delays are not allowed.</p>
<p>As for the market price of various enamel products, it once rose sharply after the implementation of the new currency system last year. Recently, due to the dense clouds of international war, the raw materials such as iron sheets and enamel powder are more expensive than before. The industry peers also held a meeting in the late month and decided that from the 23rd of the same month, the price of goods will be increased by 7%. Judging from the current situation, the market price of enamel products will continue to rise, and the impact will further reduce general purchasing power, which is what we should pay attention to.

<p>Women's Special Publication</p>
<h3>In the Midst of Bandit and Puppet Invasion of Suiyuan: The Responsibilities Women Should Bear</h3>
<p>— Hua Xu</p>
<p>For the past few days, news of the bandit and puppet invasion of Suiyuan has been published in newspapers one after another: this news brings us the bloody smell of passionate patriotism, and brings us great glory.</p>
<p>What is especially gratifying is to see the enthusiastic support of the masses in the rear in the midst of this Suiyuan crisis. This makes us feel infinite comfort and excitement. Because, if we imagine the heroic spirit of the loyal soldiers at the front who are fighting bloody battles; and if we see the tragic situation of women and children in the disaster-stricken areas, then we will no longer have any leisurely time to indulge in selfish enjoyment, nor will we allow ourselves to waste any material resources to fill our own desires. We should use all our strength to help the soldiers in Suiyuan; and we hope that we women standing at the forefront of the times will save a little time and save a little money to serve our country.</p>
<p>However, what makes our hearts ache is that in this era of great storms and turmoil, at the final moment of the nation's crisis and survival: we still see many soulless women, still applying rouge and powder, indulging in extravagance and pleasure; "The singing girls are unaware of the hatred of a fallen nation, still singing 'Backyard Flowers' across the river." This is not only a great shame for our women, but also a misfortune for our Chinese nation—On November 21, in the newspapers of this city, I saw a shocking report that "the total number of entertainment products imported in ten months was more than 7.7 million yuan," and at the same time, I also read a report on the import of consumer goods for women: -According to records, in the ten months of this year, the total import of cosmetics in Shanghai reached more than 1.1 million yuan, including 174,034 yuan for vanishing cream powder, 250,899 yuan for toothpaste and tooth powder, 435,571 yuan for perfume and lipstick, and 170,454 yuan for other cosmetic supplies. The consumption of pleasure-seeking is so shockingly high, which is really a lamentable phenomenon!</p>
<p>Now, our strong neighbors are threatening us with the "Xiaoyaojin" method; therefore, we no longer have time to hide in the room as ladies and miss, and we can no longer apply rouge and powder all day long. In this extraordinary period, since women are also members of the nation, they naturally have the responsibility to save the country and love the country. We only need to look at the women of Aiguo in the past and the women of Spain today, how bravely they enter and exit the war zone amid gunfire and artillery fire, and how hard they work in the rear to provide relief and rescue. Now, our heroes in Suiyuan, in the ice and snow, forget the cold and forget the pain, carrying broadswords and guns, fighting the enemy at the risk of their lives, breaking through the enemy's cruel barriers for the country and the nation, and raising the banner of national self-salvation! However, although women cannot go to the battlefield in person, they should save all the money spent on cosmetics, decorations, perms, and entertainment, or make some cotton clothes, vests, shoes, socks, gloves, hats, etc. to comfort the soldiers on the front line...!</p>
<h3>Northeastern Women Before and After the Incident</h3>
<p>— Wu Jiang</p>
<p>Now the area around Pingjin is smoky and chaotic due to the enemy cavalry's disturbances, and the news of Sui East being in urgent need is coming one after another, as well as the Sino-Japanese adjustment negotiations in Nanjing, etc., all of which focus the attention of the entire country on these points. The Northeastern women who are groaning under the enemy's destruction have not been noticed. It is undeniable that it is heartbreaking to think about! Now I will briefly introduce the lives of Northeastern women before the incident and their experiences after the incident to my women's community, which I believe will be beneficial.</p>
<p>Northeastern culture is backward, the atmosphere is not open, and the feudal consciousness in society is still very strong. The requirements of "women's liberation" and "equality between men and women" are simply out of the question. Education in the Northeast has never been developed, and the history of women's education is even more so. Women who should have been educated do not have the opportunity to be educated. Although there are two or three small schools (co-educational) in each county, they are all in name only. Those who run education are not serious, and no one wants to send their daughters to school, thinking that they will not learn anything by going to school, but will learn bad things instead. This is because the old concept of "a woman without talent is virtuous" is still deeply rooted. Therefore, although women's education has been carried out for many years, it has not made any progress. But since the Northeast changed its flag and surrendered to the central government, everything has been renovated and women's education has also been revitalized. However, the incident followed, and the Northeast was occupied, and the general women fell into a more tragic situation.</p>
<p>Since they are women who are in a strong feudal consciousness, when they reach the age of fifteen or sixteen, their parents will find a good husband for them to fulfill their wishes, and they can only follow "the orders of their parents and the words of the matchmaker" to complete their lifelong event. When they are at home as daughters, they have to help their families cook, do chores, or take care of their younger siblings (of course, the daughters of landlords and wealthy families have nothing to do). When they have some free time, they sit on the kang head and work on everything they need for their wedding: such as clothes, bedding, pillows, shoes...etc. These things need to be prepared enough for the needs of the second half of their lives...Because after arriving at the husband's house, everything except food is their own. After marriage, they only have the heaven-sent duty to work hard and serve their parents-in-law. What rights can they enjoy? Therefore, their only hope is to have a son quickly. Having a son will give them something to rely on in the second half of their lives, and having a son is also what their parents-in-law pray for day and night, so at least they can be looked upon favorably by their parents-in-law. This is following the ancient precepts of the so-called "three obediences."</p>
<p>Those women who have received secondary education naturally have some awareness of themselves, but except for a few excellent or well-supported ones who can obtain a job (such as being an elementary school teacher, only being an elementary school teacher), most of the others feel frustrated that there is no way out. Therefore, marriage is the only way. Marriage is their final destination. There are social factors in the formation of this unpromising trend.</p>
<p>However, since the September 18th Incident, under the turbulent situation of the enemy cavalry coming and going, young women in general have no way to avoid being defiled and have no way to cry out. In counties such as Shulan and Yushu in Jilin, many young girls have no choice but to marry local relatives, friends, or neighbors unconditionally. In the past few years, after being robbed by force, houses were burned down, fields were occupied, and family members were either harmed or reduced to a group of hungry and displaced people. How can they not be trampled on and humiliated (of course, in major cities, the enemy will still pretend to be civilized, but in various counties and villages, they have no scruples)? Except for the sisters and daughters of a few traitors who are sent to island countries to study and be cultivated into pro-× elements and used as tools of enslavement.</p>
<p>In the past few years, under layers of oppression and hardship, they have aroused a strong sense of national identity. They deeply know that being a slaughtered lamb or hoping for the rescue of the motherland is not a good plan. Only by strengthening their own will and fighting the enemy desperately can they find a way out. Therefore, it is heard every day that they automatically join the volunteer army. They play a big role in the volunteer army, such as detecting the enemy's military situation, taking care of injured compatriots, and washing and sewing. They also directly participate in the work of fighting the enemy, and their deaths are unrepentant and extremely tragic. Our female compatriots, the national crisis has come to the final moment, quickly rise up, follow the example of our Northeastern sisters and fight bloody battles to save the nation from danger!</p>
<h3>The Invention of Artificial Insemination</h3>
<p>— Mo</p>
<p>"Artificial insemination" seems to be unreasonable and impossible, because there has never been a case of pregnancy without the union of male and female in humans. But in this technologically advanced 20th century, there are people who are devoted to studying this matter that we think is impossible, and according to recent reports, this research has reached a stage, and the method of artificial insemination has been invented.</p>
<p>The person engaged in the research on this artificial insemination method is Professor Kokolik of Physiology at Harvard University in the United States, Dr. Keethe Ibinkas. Two years ago, the doctor collected the oocytes of a female rabbit, put them in a bottle, and then added the semen of a male rabbit. After twenty minutes, the oocytes were taken out and inserted into the fallopian tube of the female rabbit. After thirty-three days, the female rabbit gave birth to six rabbits. Due to this success, Dr. Ke continued to work hard on the research, and finally recently, he got more satisfactory results. At the Experimental Physiology Society held in Washington this year, Dr. Ke presented a very detailed report. His report is that the research on artificial insemination has reached a more advanced stage than two years ago, without the need for male semen. He immersed the oocytes of the rabbit in salt water and then heated them to above 113 degrees before inserting them into the fallopian tube of the female rabbit, and finally also gave birth to rabbits. This method is a further step than two years ago. Dr. Ke also believes that humans and rabbits are both mammals, and rabbits can be artificially inseminated, so it is also possible for humans.</p>
<p>Dr. Ke's invention of artificial insemination can certainly be said to be a great miracle of modern science, but this invention may not be suitable for humans or other animals. The harmony of the two sexes, male and female, has a great influence on physiology. If the relationship between the sexes is eliminated and virgins are artificially inseminated, the result will be a change in physiology, and in fact, no one would want to do that. Basically, the union of the two sexes to harmonize the development of both sides is the law of nature. Not only in humans, but in all animals, life is inseparable from the two sexes. Therefore, the invention of this artificial insemination method may not be of great benefit to humans, but in the history of science, this invention cannot be said to be in vain.</p>
<h3>Words About Women</h3>
<p>— Lu Yan</p>
<p>I am very willing to talk to women more, because they can tell me many things that men don't know. (India, Tagore).</p>
<p>Women are the source of the nation. According to the principles of eugenics, all corrupt thoughts are enough to affect the thoughts of the future nation. (Turkey, Kemal).</p>
<p>Madam, raise your children, educate your children: making your daughter a healthy citizen is your indirect contribution to the Pan-system. (Italy, Mussolini).</p>
<p>A family, a country, may very well be able to grasp the rise and fall in the hands of a woman. (Germany, Hitler.)</p>
<p>Women are the mothers of mankind. We should express infinite love to them. Don't you see that they are so kind and lovable? (Soviet Union, Stalin).</p>
<p>Don't scold women for being disasters, don't you see the pain your mother went through when she gave birth to you? And, maybe your mother died in childbirth? (Humorist Bernard Shaw)</p>
<p>Women are amazing. They only need to work hard in two jobs, unremittingly, and their strength can really revive a lost nation. (Indian Gandhi)</p>
<p>Special Feature by This Newspaper</p>
<h3>Ms. Zhou Lihua Discusses Child Rearing</h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>A mother without knowledge means her children won't have a good life; a mother who isn't responsible is even more pitiable than one without knowledge!</p>
<p>A few days ago, I was talking with a few friends, all Western painters, and the conversation naturally revolved around art. One of them highly recommended Ms. Zhou Lihua, saying she had toiled over Western painting for more than twenty years, and her work was exceptionally outstanding, on the verge of following in the footsteps of Pan Yuliang, with her work set to be featured in this year's Shanghai Second Women's Western Painting Exhibition. At the time, I had a mental image of her. Sure enough, in less than half a month, Ms. Zhou's painting exhibition appeared on the upper floor of the Great World Company. I took some time to attend and appreciate it. After seeing all two hundred-plus oil paintings, I truly believed what my friend had said was accurate. Although I'm a layman when it comes to painting, I can still discern good from bad to some extent. Her paintings not only use feeling to control color tones but also possess poignant and moving emotions, and their underlying meanings are also profound. She is truly a painter with a rich inner world. For example, "Compatriots Under Enemy Planes," "White Snow and Red Blood," "Eternity," "Peace God Under the Storm"... Several of these works coincided with the headlines we publish in our newspaper every day. These are like sketches from the front lines, piercing the hearts of every compatriot. They can truly be called "art for national defense." Today's peace god is already in a storm, and the dream of peace is faint and uncertain. In this dire situation, the only way is to concentrate the nation's strength and inflict a heavy blow on the enemy!</p>
<p>That day, I first admired her paintings and then got to know her. We hit it off immediately. During our conversation, she revealed her straightforward nature, her arduous struggles, and her hatred of hypocrisy and concealment in the world. She said, "I grew up in Xuzhou. My father was from Ruizhou, Jiangxi, so Xuzhou can only be called my second hometown. I've lived in Shanghai since I was seventeen. After the abolition of special examinations, I served in the education sector for a while. Later, due to family responsibilities, I couldn't work outside, so painting became my only job every day. I've loved painting since I was little, and I've never been tired of it in the past twenty years. My family life is also different from others. I don't work, and my husband's income is limited, but I need all kinds of expensive imported materials for oil painting. I don't want to waste my career because of thrift, and he won't complain about me spending too much, but I always feel bad about it. Therefore, I have a way to compensate: I don't hire a servant. Cooking, shopping, washing clothes, and cleaning the house are all my responsibility. The money saved from hiring a servant can be used to paint a few more oil paintings. It's a worthwhile thing. Most people in society will never understand the spiritual joy one gains from sacrificing everything else for a particular hobby. Some friends say I'm a bit silly. Why not hire a servant to save myself some effort and enjoy life? This is certainly well-intentioned, but they don't understand that I don't feel any pain because of it. On the contrary, I feel very comfortable and physically strong because I have a fixed job every day. He also understands my heart and appreciates my efforts, helping me with everything. Because of this mutual support, we become closer and more harmonious. This price cannot be measured by money." From family life, we moved on to the current women's issue. She said heavily, "Raising women's rights has been sung for so many years, but it's still a male-dominated society. What status do women have? There are countless pitiful women in society who are groaning in dark environments. There are two kinds of women: one is women who are drunk with life and only know how to enjoy themselves, and the other is women who are uneducated and live like beasts of burden. What do they know about women's rights? Who will liberate them? The so-called raising women's rights is just a pipe dream or like the Japanese saying 'friendship' to the Chinese, which is nothing but empty words. So, when it comes to women's rights, I don't know where to start." Then she didn't want to talk about it anymore, but she turned to the issue of child-rearing.</p>
<p>"Children are the main members of every family. Therefore, the child's mother should preferably be knowledgeable and know how to manage the household. Otherwise, if the mother is scatterbrained and doesn't know good habits, early childhood psychology, and methods of education, not to mention hygiene, even if she is born into a wealthy family, the mother is knowledgeable but is too fond of playing, loves socializing, and doesn't take care of the family. She is irresponsible to her children. Some want economic independence and go out to work, entrusting the children to ignorant servants who casually beat and scold them and manage them poorly. These children are more pitiful than children from poor families! It can be seen that not educating children well because of economic reasons not only results in a loss for the family but also has a great impact on society and the nation. From this issue, we can see that only four types of women can engage in professional activities: (1) unmarried women, (2) single women, (3) women who have not had children, and (4) women whose children have grown up. I think women who don't meet these four conditions should not give up their vocation and honestly manage the household and wholeheartedly educate their children. If economic problems arise, they can seek appropriate side jobs that can be done in parallel without conflict. Women's entertainment should also not be neglected. I think the best are music, sports, painting, travel, film, or talking with friends to learn from each other. Other improper pastimes are really meaningless."</p>
<p>Regarding the system of large families versus small families, she also briefly mentioned, based on her past experience, that "the most difficult thing for a woman to deal with is the environment of a large family. For one thing, the father-in-law says one thing, the mother-in-law says another, so the opinions of the husband and wife are inconsistent. It is difficult to reconcile the old and new ideas. Each sticks to their own views, forming a multi-headed government. Naive children are most likely to imitate. Growing up in this environment, they are most likely to develop unhealthy thoughts and habits. Therefore, bankrupt families are the result of the transformation of large families, and spendthrifts are also produced by large families. Naturally, according to the current trend, whether in rural or urban areas, the paper structure of large families should be changed to small families. Husband and wife help each other, cooperate, open up their finances, manage strictly, and unify orders. Usually, give children good and reasonable impressions, and the future of their children will definitely not go astray. This is my small contribution to the new family."</p>
<h3>Marriages of Women in Inner Mongolia</h3>
<p>— Xue Wen</p>
<p>Due to the remoteness of the region and the inconvenience of transportation, it is undeniable that the cultural level of our Mongolian compatriots is relatively low. The backwardness of knowledge among women is also undeniable. Because of this, the cries for "equality between men and women" and the slogans of "freedom of marriage" that resound throughout the inland seem to have little to do with them—or only a small part!</p>
<p>Their marriages, needless to say, are under the feudal forces of parents' orders and matchmakers' words, with a strong "commercial" color. When two families arrange a marriage, they often use a number of cattle and sheep as betrothal gifts. This is, of course, a different and new posture from the "cash transaction" method of old-fashioned Han Chinese marriages!</p>
<p>After the engagement, a "gift-giving" ceremony is held, with a feast prepared and relatives and friends invited to participate, presumably to express congratulations! This day is very lively.</p>
<p>As for the wedding ceremony, it is not entirely the same. The most interesting thing is the "crying" after the bride enters the house. Originally, this also existed in old-fashioned Han Chinese marriages, but their "crying" is very special. It is not just the bride crying alone, but several women accompany her to "cry" together. The crying is so sad, as if they will never see each other again in this life, and they also tell stories with great pain, making anyone who listens feel a sense of sorrow! This "crying" lasts for quite a long time.</p>
<p>The second thing to mention is "grabbing bones." This is probably similar to the Han Chinese "teasing the bridal chamber." The method is that at night, the cook sets aside a bone in advance, and the groom and the bride's girlfriends or sisters grab it together. If the groom gets it, there is naturally no problem, but in fact, it is unlikely to fall into his hands. After these girls get the bone, they treat it like a rare treasure, and it becomes a commodity to be hoarded. They put it on the table, and the groom pleads with them and asks them for it because once he gets the bone, he can avoid a lot of trouble. And they think of various ways to tease him as a condition of exchange. The most common is to ask the groom to kowtow to them, sometimes a lot. After he does everything they ask, they change their minds and ask him to sing a certain number of ditties, even hundreds or thousands, but this can be done by asking someone else to sing instead. It often goes on all night, making the groom enjoy himself to the fullest. Although this is a near-ridiculous matter, it is still being followed unswervingly, and some people simply regard it as a "daunting task."</p>
<p>Although their marriages are arranged by their parents, most of them live very harmoniously, and the word "divorce" is not heard. Perhaps they simply don't have that concept!</p>
<p>They have a very strong concept of chastity and are very able to follow the creed of loyalty to one husband. But having said that, men also respect their personality in the same way, and things like "taking concubines" and "divorcing wives" are very rare.</p>
<p>Brief news: Since the bandit puppets invaded Suiyuan, the soldiers in Suizhong have been showing ardent patriotism and working hard to resist. People across the country have been inspired by this and have been providing assistance. Zhou Shoujuan, the editor of this journal, recently in Suzhou, together with Shi Jiyan, the director of Dongwu University affairs, Fan Yunshu, the director of the park, and dozens of well-known calligraphers, painters, horticulturalists, collectors, fish farmers, etc., initiated a aesthetic exhibition to comfort the soldiers in Suiyuan. All kinds of calligraphy, paintings, antiques, flowers, goldfish, and other artworks are displayed for art lovers to appreciate. The venue is the Lequn Society in Gongxiang Lane in Guanqian. The dates are from today (October 28) to December 1, from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM every day. Each ticket is four jiao in ocean dollars, and student tickets are half price. All proceeds will be sent to Suiyuan to support the army. It is said that thousands of gifts have been collected. Each ticket can be used for a lottery to add to the interest. It is hoped that the gentlemen and ladies in Shanghai will visit to support this grand event.</p>
<h3>Live Burial</h3>
<p>— Xue Ying</p>
<p>K County is truly a place of beautiful mountains and clear waters. Not to mention that Chinese people love to play there, even foreigners want to rush there to play every year. However, such a beautiful environment, exceptionally, cannot make the common people who grow up in the mountains and rivers become smarter. So when K County is mentioned, people often associate it with those magnificent landscapes and a group of fierce and crude natives. Over there, hundreds of people fighting with weapons or snatching a widow who has just lost her husband to be a wife is a common sight.</p>
<p>Sun Ziqing was an old merchant in his fifties, originally from A County. Later, due to the problem of livelihood, he wandered to K County, where he started a family and had a son and a daughter. The son wandered out five or six years ago and has not had a letter since. The daughter, because Sun Ziqing was old and unable to make money to support her, was given to a Miao family who ran a tofu shop as a child bride in the second year after her son left, according to local custom. The daughter is now a young daughter-in-law of twenty-two years old, but the young boss of the Miao family's tofu shop is not yet sixteen years old. According to the Miao boss, they will not consummate the marriage until next year!</p>
<p>It had been snowing for several days in a row, and the old woman fell ill. Sun Ziqing took out a newly compiled book of proven prescriptions that he had copied over the years, picked a few medicinal herbs, held up a broken umbrella, braced himself, and rushed to the avenue in the heavy snow, hoping to buy a bag of medicine back to treat his old wife. Just as he slowly approached the door of the Miao family's tofu shop, he suddenly felt something strange. Why were so many people crowded into the small shop? And why was the noise so loud? Because his daughter was the child bride here, he couldn't help but want to squeeze in to take a look. But the crowd suddenly rushed out like waves, and behind them, two grown men were driving out a naked young daughter-in-law with ropes. The one on the left was his father-in-law, Boss Miao, and although the young daughter-in-law was covered in blood and her face had turned as muddy as if it hadn't rained for a long time, her original appearance had not changed. It was his daughter. His broken umbrella had fallen from his hand, and his body was shaking. It was with great difficulty that he struggled out five words:</p>
<p>"What are you doing..."</p>
<p>His shout must have been heard by Boss Miao, but he did not stop his footsteps.</p>
<p>"Your daughter is unchaste and is going to be buried alive!" A straightforward reply. At the same time, countless people were making beast-like roars: "Live burial!" "Live burial!" They were all as excited as if they were at a race. The three people in the middle were rushing east in the heavy snow.</p>
<p>"Dad... help..." Sun Ziqing seemed to hear a miserable cry piercing his eardrums, which made him forget everything. Waving his fists, he rushed towards the crowd. He used his hands, feet, head, and even his already broken teeth to desperately try to save his daughter, but what use was an old man? His clothes were torn to shreds by those beasts, and his white beard and hair were almost all falling out. He was pushed to the ground in the snow, watching his daughter being carried away.</p>
<p>"Bury me alive! Bury me alive!" He shouted with all his strength. Finally, he himself was buried alive by the ruthless snow.</p>

<p>Discussion</p>
<h3>On the Nobel Peace Prize</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>According to reports, the Nobel Peace Prize Committee has decided to award this year's Peace Prize to Argentine Foreign Minister Saavedra Lamas. As for last year's Peace Prize, because it was not decided at the time who to award it to, it has now been decided to award it to German pacifist writer Carl von Ossietzky.</p>
<p>The Nobel Peace Prize is established to be awarded to those who have contributed to the cause of peace. For example, this year's winner, Saavedra Lamas, has contributed to the cause of peace by proposing the conclusion of the Pan-American Non-Aggression Pact and convening the Chaco Peace Conference. Last year's winner, Carl von Ossietzky, is a pacifist who has been detained in a detention camp by the authorities of his own country for two years because of his belief in pacifism. He was only recently released.</p>
<p>However, the German authorities have expressed their views on this matter, saying that Carl von Ossietzky is a notorious traitor who was detained and sentenced to detention for treason. He was recently released. The Nobel Peace Prize Committee is now awarding the Peace Prize to this traitor, which is an insult to the new Germany and a near challenge. If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? The German government will make an announcement and respond clearly.</p>
<p>The Nobel Peace Prize Committee's decision to award last year's Peace Prize to German pacifist writer Carl von Ossietzky is very appropriate because Carl von Ossietzky is a pacifist who has contributed to the cause of peace. However, it is not without reason that this matter has aroused opposition from the German authorities because Carl von Ossietzky has attacked his country's aggressive policies and has been deemed unacceptable by the government and sentenced to treason. It is unacceptable to the German authorities that this traitor has won the Peace Prize.</p>
<p>However, the German authorities' expression of indignation, on the one hand, is enough to expose the new Germany's behavior as incompatible with peace, and on the other hand, it is enough to show that Carl von Ossietzky has contributed to the cause of peace and deserves the Peace Prize. Carl von Ossietzky's detention for his belief in pacifism is a iron proof.</p>
<p>I remember someone once suggesting that this year's Nobel Peace Prize should be awarded to the German head of state. The reason, it was said, was that the reason why the European situation can maintain peace today is all thanks to the efforts of the German head of state alone for the cause of peace. Unfortunately, this proposal was not only not adopted by the Nobel Peace Prize Committee, but the committee also awarded last year's Peace Prize to the traitor of the German government. This move is no wonder considered an insult.</p>
<p>Recently, the German Anti-Comintern Pact has been established, and Germany has completed another peace project. If the Nobel Peace Prize has not yet been decided at this time who to award it to, it is really necessary to consider it. Argentine Foreign Minister Saavedra Lamas and German pacifist writer Carl von Ossietzky have already been decided as the winners, and the Peace Prize has fallen on them. The opposition of the German authorities is unlikely to produce results.</p>

<h3>Doves</h3>
<p>— Lin Jia</p>
<p>Winter Sketches</p>
<p>It often snows in the winter in the northern country. After the snow stops, the green wheat seedlings that have just emerged from the ground are also buried. The fields are covered with a white expanse of silver light. Crows perch on the bare branches of withered trees, leaning over and cawing, and under the gray and cloudy sky, the cold wind howls through the streets and alleys. The countryside is silent, and people are huddled in their houses. The elderly may be dozing off around a charcoal stove. The entire forest is like being covered with a large white felt blanket, sleeping soundly like a good child.</p>
<p>There is an empty courtyard in front of my house. When the wind and snow subside, my younger brother often takes a small broom to sweep the snow. The snow on the ground is pushed to the side of the official road, revealing a flat piece of yellow earth. He covers the basket trap and props it up with a two-foot-high wooden pole. A long hemp rope is tied to the pole and zigzags straight into the wood shed. The trap is set. This naughty child makes a joyful face, quietly takes out two handfuls of corn from the grain jar, and scatters them densely inside the trap. He scatters some sparsely on the ground near the entrance of the trap. Then, he crouches behind the wood shed, holding the rope, and peeks at the movement on the ground with his little head raised.</p>
<p>When snow covers everything, doves often see a patch of yellow soil and spread their wings, skimming low over the ground to take a look. Two active and greedy doves discover many yellow particles floating scattered on the ground, so they coo twice, spread their wings, and lightly hop, pecking at one or two grains on the edge, and look nervously at the black monster. After bending down again to eat a few grains, there is still nothing alarming. The little companions standing on the top of the high building across the street with their small red eyes staring and wearing tile-colored robes, one by one, like withered leaves in the autumn wind, flutter and fall. The particles along the edge are eaten up, and the bold ones peck at the grains inside one by one. Gradually they become unconcerned and rush to grab the yellow, crystal-clear particles. When the outside of the basket trap is all eaten up, they sneak a peek at the trap entrance that looks like an open mouth, and they are a little afraid. They fly away from the ground again, and scout around. The timid ones jump and watch the movement from the side. When they come back after scouting, they don't look at anything and go straight to the pile of full food inside the trap, pecking like click beetles. The few hesitating ones in the back also bravely turn to go inside to compete with those companions face-to-face.</p>
<p>The younger brother's hand tightens the rope and pulls it hard backwards. With a "poof" sound, the ones that are not trapped flutter frantically back to the top of the building. Inside the basket, there is a "prala" sound. The younger brother joyfully holds the specially made net bag and lightly lifts a gap in the opening of the basket. The net bag is propped up at the gap. Seeing a line of light coming in from the outside, the doves struggle to get out, but when they rush out in a hurry, thinking they are saved, they are caught by the younger brother through a layer of netting.</p>
<p>In the evening, they are killed by the stove and put in a boiling soup pot to cook. The father will have wine and dishes the next day.</p>
<h3>Song</h3>
<p>— Li Liwen</p>
<p>Sea!</p>
<p>Sea!</p>
<p>Fish—come!</p>
<p>Ai ai yo——</p>
<p>Fishermen——laugh!</p>
<p>Sea!</p>
<p>Waves!</p>
<p>In the village by the sea of Cilacap, this song had evoked my infinite melancholy. At that time, I had been sent to a relative's house there to recuperate because of a brain disease. The relative was a pond owner who owned dozens of ponds. His Western-style wooden house was the most beautiful and magnificent building in the village. From the entrance of the village, looking far away, the red roof surrounded by green trees was almost considered the only happy paradise in the village. Many people cast envious glances at it. Children liked to gather on the lawn in front of the door, making all kinds of strange and beautiful dreams about the house. My window faced the lawn. Many times, the song was driven in from the window, gently swaying in the quiet air. At those times, I became intoxicated, lying quietly in bed listening to that tender song as my dream. Or, I would walk to the seaside, stand on the soft beach, gazing at the vast sea, watching the sea shimmering with golden waves in the warm sun, and listening to the sea singing softly in the caress of the gentle breeze. …</p>
<p>Soon, I also became familiar with that song. It cooled and moisturized me, as if a sweet rain had fallen in the great desert. So: in extremely calm times, when the wind in the night sent over the whispers of leaves and the sea, when I looked far out the window at the vast, leaping sea water, or when the children's songs crept in gently from the window, I also hummed that song.</p>
<p>My illness slowly got better.</p>
<p>But one day, a great tragedy suddenly occurred in the village: only four or five of the fifty-plus fishing boats that went out to sea returned, and the rest were deeply buried in the sea that had been whipped up by great waves. The village was shrouded in irreparable grief. From people's faces, from the corners of children's mouths, it was extremely rare to find that trace of a smile. —The song that intoxicated people's melancholy like a poem no longer sounded.</p>
<p>My relatives were not touched by this atmosphere of sorrow; they still lived the same life. However, for me, my heart trembled. The sea breeze made my head ache, and the swaying leaves in the deep night made me feel as if I heard that song again, and I became sleepless again. My heart fell into the hearts of the villagers. …</p>
<p>A few days later, I wrote a letter to my father, writing my sorrow in every word—so, one morning, I quietly left Cilacap, bringing a sorrowful heart back to the capital of Batavia.</p>
<h3>Effective Frostbite Medicine - Unbroken: Eliminates Swelling on the Same Day - Broken: Achieves Success Soon</h3>
<p>Frostbite is a disease caused by the coagulation of stagnant blood. At the beginning, it is red and swollen, causing unbearable pain and itching. After ulceration, pus drips, and the pain is even worse. This disease is especially common during winter, and the world lacks good remedies, causing patients to suffer. Now, fortunately, Zhengwei Pharmacy (Second Malu, Yinghua Jie intersection) has invented two kinds of effective medicines: (1) Frostbite Wish-Fulfilling Water, specially for treating unbroken frostbite. Once tried, the pain and itching stop immediately, and the redness and swelling disappear instantly. (2) Pearl White Jade Cream, specially for treating broken frostbite. Once tried, it removes the rotten and regenerates the new, and the wound heals soon. The prices are: Wish-Fulfilling Water, two jiao per bottle; White Jade Cream, four jiao per box.</p>
<h3>New Guest House</h3>
<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<p>We, this group of miserable people, without the protection of our motherland, are now being driven into this temporary prison. Many people call this place "New Guest House."</p>
<p>This is a rather grand building, with thick cement walls on all sides, and square windows made of iron bars. Now we are completely isolated from the outside world. As soon as the last of our companions entered, the iron gate was immediately closed and locked.</p>
<p>The cries of children and women gradually subsided. Many people sat on the damp ground, staring at each other with the expressions of famine refugees. An old woman cried to herself:</p>
<p>"Why are you locking me up? Heavens!" She shook her hands in despair. "I haven't committed any crime. Why are you even bringing an old woman like me, who's about to enter her coffin, in here! You people will die without descendants! Where are you telling my Ren'er to find me?"</p>
<p>Her hoarse voice kept ringing out, speaking and stopping, stopping and speaking, always pulling up her clothes to wipe her eyes, her hands constantly waving, as if beckoning to someone. Then she suddenly shouted loudly: "You damned, good-for-nothing people! I want to see how long you'll lock me up for! How long! You childless and grandchildless people! Did I dig up your ancestors' graves in my past life and smash your ancestors' ash urns?"</p>
<p>This mournful voice made us tremble. Many people's consciousness was awakened by this sharp voice, and they all began to curse in low voices. The space of the entire house was filled with angry sounds.</p>
<p>However, the matter of not being able to leave until tomorrow morning had already been decided. Although we felt bitter and aggrieved in our hearts, our fluctuating emotions finally calmed down slowly, and at the same time, the feeling of hunger also began to rise.</p>
<p>The thought of this kind of inhuman treatment stirred up a surge of indignation among us.</p>
<p>"Do they want to starve us to death? Even in prison, they give you rice to eat! Damn it, are we still human?" a young man said. Then he turned around and said to me with a challenging attitude:</p>
<p>"It's really bad luck to be born Chinese! Don't you think the Chinese who sit on the 'horse mane' should have left by boat long ago!"</p>

<p>Rosacea on the Face</p>
<p>No. 108, No. 200, Ruihua Fang, Lafayette Road, Mr. Li Yanbo asks: The tip of my nose is often red and has small blisters. When pricked open, there is pus and blood. When it is severe, pressing on it feels slightly painful inside. Small blisters also appear on my face from time to time, the common name for which is "rosacea," appearing in spots, one after another, which is very annoying. (1) What is the cause of the two diseases? (2) Are they internal diseases, or just skin diseases? (3) How to treat them? What medicine to apply or take? (4) Should I have a blood test?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) The former is called acne rosacea, and the latter is called acne vulgaris. There are many causes for the former, congestion, digestive disorders, drinking alcohol, anemia, and abnormal blood vessel nerves can all cause it. I don't know which of these five causes you believe you have. The latter is caused by increased sebum secretion. (2) Skin disease, but it has a considerable relationship with internal diseases. (3) First diagnose what kind of internal disease there is, then treat this internal disease first. Relying solely on applying medicine is close to treating the symptoms. Apply "Pixrol Ointment," inject "Sod. Gacodylate." (4) A blood test should be performed to determine whether there is anemia.</p>
<p>Crooked Mouth and Slanted Face</p>
<p>No. 109, Mr. Li Zhongyong asks: I have never engaged in seeking pleasure with women, but I suffered from a throat ailment last month, which was cured by injections of serum. Following the doctor's instructions, I stayed in bed for more than ten days after the illness. After getting up, because I was mentally depressed, I went to Pudong for a trip. Who knew that I caught a cold in my stomach while on the bow of the boat. The next day, my mouth and eyes suddenly became crooked, and my left face could not move by itself, the corners of my mouth pulled upwards. When I closed my eyes, the corners of my mouth pulled up at the same time, and it was very difficult to close my eyes. Therefore, I ask: (1) What is the name of this disease? (2) How long will it take to heal? (3) What medicine should I take?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) Facial nerve palsy. (2) At least one week, at most half a year. If it is not cured, it can become a lifelong disease. (3) Take "Endojodin," massage, electrotherapy, warm water compress (or using "Saulloid" hot compress has the same effect).</p>
<p>Preputial Ulcer</p>
<p>No. 110, Mr. Ding Yixin asks: After engaging in pleasure-seeking, a small ulcer appeared on the inner surface of my foreskin. Knowing that I had contracted a disease, I immediately asked a doctor on Sima Road to inject 914 twice before it healed. Thinking that I was completely cured, I didn't pay attention to it. But a few days ago, many small red spots suddenly appeared all over my body. I intend to go to your place for diagnosis and treatment. Please tell me first: (1) Is it syphilis, and which stage is it? (2) What other symptoms should there be in addition to syphilis? (3) Why is this disease so difficult to cure? (4) What is the root treatment method? (5) What will happen if it is not treated?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) Secondary syphilis. (2) Bone pain, hair loss, swollen lymph nodes. (3) This disease is quite difficult to cure. (4) First inject 606, one injection per week, for six consecutive injections, and at the same time inject "Carbisin" a dozen, one injection every three days. Rest for two months, and if the blood test is negative, do not inject anymore, but a test is still required six months later. If the blood test is still positive (toxic) after two months, inject again as above until it is negative (non-toxic). (5) It depends on the area invaded: if it invades the brain, it is neurosyphilis; if it invades the spinal cord, it is spinal cord syphilis; if it invades the liver, it is liver syphilis. There are many symptoms, which cannot be exhausted in a few words.</p>
<p>Difficulty Breathing</p>
<p>No. 111, Mr. Ren Xingyu, Sanma Road, Henan Road asks: A relative of mine suffered from chronic heart disease in the winter of the 22nd year of the Republic of China due to overwork. When the disease occurred, he was very short of breath, had difficulty breathing, and could not sit or lie down, only stand and walk, and because of this, his spirit deteriorated day by day. At first, he was treated by Chinese medicine, with no effect at all. Later, he was treated by Western doctors ×××, etc., and although he was given injections and medication, the condition did not improve, but became more and more severe, almost to the point of death. Later, introduced by a friend, he went to ×× Hospital to be treated by Japanese doctor ××, who was able to lie down after one consultation. After more than ten treatments, he actually recovered. However, my relative is intoxicated with Chinese medicine, and at the same time, because ××'s medicine is numb and spicy and difficult to take, he is unwilling to consult the Japanese doctor again, and then engages Chinese doctor ××× for treatment. At first, it was probably the recovery period, so there was still progress. But when it recurred again, the Chinese doctor was also at a loss. When he went to the Japanese doctor for consultation again, one dose was effective. However, it recurs every time and cannot be eradicated. It has been three years since then, and his finances have run out, so since the spring of last year, it has been happening once a month. When it happens, he goes to the Japanese for treatment, and he gets better after the diagnosis. But now, sometimes due to financial constraints, he does not seek medical treatment. Because of this, it has happened three or four times this month. In the middle, he went to ×× Hospital and Dr. ××× for consultation, but to no avail. In summary, there are several questions, and I sincerely ask for your guidance: (1) According to the Japanese doctor: "The disease is chronic heart disease, arising from the intercostal space, leading to cardiac hypertrophy and difficulty breathing. It is extremely taboo to overwork the body and mind, as well as smoking, alcohol, and meat. Because it is not a long-term treatment, there is no way to completely cure it." I wonder if this is true? (2) Why are other Western medicines ineffective, and only Japanese medicine can calm the breath with one dose? The taste of the medicine is very numb, and vomiting often occurs after taking it! 'Sparkling water' utensils turn white when they come into contact with it. What kind of medicine is it? (3) What medicine is most effective for this disease right now?</p>
<p>Answer: Your friend's disease is cardiac asthma, and there are many reasons for it, such as coronary heart disease, myocarditis, or heart failure. As for (1) what Matsui said, I have not examined it, so of course I cannot criticize whether it is correct, but since he made this argument after examination, it should not be wrong. (2) To criticize a doctor's scholarship cannot be based solely on whether a certain dose of medicine is effective. This ×× may have special experience with this disease. Any fatty and aromatic medicines can discolor 'sparkling water,' so based solely on this point, it is impossible to infer what medicine it is. (2) Since ××'s medicine is effective, it is appropriate to entrust him to diagnose and treat it. If it is really because of "financial constraints" as you said, then taking "Tinctura. Campho. Compound" and "Ephedrin Sulphate "Star Brand"" internally is also possible. Take one mace of the former each time, and one or two tablets of the latter each time. Pay the greatest attention when taking it!</p>
<p>Pain in Both Sides of the Stomach</p>
<p>No. 112, Mr. Wang Shuzhi asks: My wife has always had irregular menstruation. After seeing your answer to someone else's letter, which mentioned taking "Danggui Er," she took several bottles in a row and has fully recovered. However, my wife also has abdominal pain, pain in both hypochondria, and it occurs at a specific time, namely the 13th to 16th or 17th day after menstruation. When she has abdominal pain, she rolls around in bed and sweats profusely. Although she has consulted doctors, they mostly prescribe painkillers temporarily. Therefore, I ask (1) that you recommend a good medicine! (2) Many doctors have examined this pain, and each says something different. The so-called national doctors are even more deceptive. I have consulted seven national doctors, and they have come up with seven different disease names, and the medicine that was taken is like a stone sinking into the sea, with no effect even temporarily. Please tell me, what is the name of this disease? (3) What causes it?</p>
<p>Answer! (1) Take "Chatone," and apply "sanfjoid" hot compress to the abdomen is also effective. Usually, it is best to take tonics regularly, such as "Livemin" or inject "Blusen," etc.</p>
<p>Loss of Appetite</p>
<p>No. 113, Mr. Han Muchen asks: I suffered from dysentery two months ago. Later, acupuncture and medication were used, and I recovered in less than a week. But since then, I have often suffered from constipation, loss of appetite, and aversion to food. Recently, when I look in the mirror, my face is sallow and my muscles are thin, which is completely different from before I got sick, so I am very worried. Please advise on treatment!</p>
<p>Answer: Pay attention to cooking, take "Acit-ose-Pepsin," and when constipated, insert a "Glycerin su-ppository" into the anus.</p>
<p>(Chronic Leukorrhea)</p>
<p>No. 114, Zheng Baijun, Fuding Shouning County Government, asks: I have suffered from leukorrhea for four times. There are those who have taken herbal medicine and recovered, and there are also those who have recovered after injecting "Gonacriudin." But this time, due to excessive sexual activity, the old disease recurred. I don't know if it is because my body is too weak, or the woman's reproductive organs are unclean, which causes me to often contract this disease. At the beginning, it was not very painful, and there was not much leukorrhea either. Because there is no Western medicine store in this county, and there are no doctors to inject, I took six or seven doses of local herbal medicine. Now it has gradually subsided and healed, but it cannot be completely eradicated. There is still one or two drops of discharge every day and night. When I am excited, it does not sting at all, and it is no different from being without disease. If this is prolonged, (1) will it affect fertility? (2) Please recommend a good medicine (3) What is the price of oral tablets of Gonacriudin? Please let me know all this.</p>
<p>Answer: You and your wife have chronic gonorrhea. When you think you are cured, you are actually not cured. However, the gonococcus is temporarily latent and does not show symptoms. When the disease encounters a suitable opportunity (such as drinking alcohol, overwork), it recurs. As for the so-called "body is too weak" and "woman's reproductive organs are unclean," it is irrelevant. (1) This disease alone does not harm fertility, but when men cause prostatitis, orchitis, or seminal vesiculitis, and women cause ovaritis, fertility is hopeless. (2) Chronic gonorrhea cannot be cured by relying solely on oral medication. Please use "Argonnacrindin" for rinsing twice a day for a month continuously without interruption. Stop having sex during this treatment period to prevent mutual infection and hinder healing.</p>
<p>(Ringworm)</p>
<p>No. 115, Qian Qingjun asks: I was not careful and don't know where I contracted tinea, which is on my buttocks and the inner sides of my lower legs, causing extreme itching. Please advise on treatment.</p>
<p>Answer: Apply "Spiritus Acid Salicylic".</p>

<p>Talk</p>
<h3>Regarding the Nobel Peace Prize</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>Reports say that the Nobel Peace Prize Committee has recently decided to award this year's Peace Prize to the Argentine Foreign Minister Saavedra Lamas. As for the previous Peace Prize, because no one had been decided to be awarded at the time, it has now also been decided to award it to the German pacifist writer Carl von Ossietzky.</p>
<p>The Nobel Peace Prize is established to be awarded to those who have contributed to the cause of peace. For example, this year's winner Saavedra Lamas has contributed to the cause of peace by proposing the conclusion of the Pan-American Non-Aggression Pact and convening the Chaco Peace Conference. The previous winner, Carl von Ossietzky, is a pacifist who was detained in a detention camp by his own country's authorities for believing in pacifism for two years before being released recently.</p>
<p>However, the German authorities have recently made some statements, saying that Carl von Ossietzky is a famous traitor who was detained and sentenced to imprisonment for treason, and was recently released. The Nobel Peace Prize Committee is now awarding this traitor the Peace Prize, which is an insult to the new Germany and an act close to challenging it. If this is tolerable, what is not tolerable? The German government will often make announcements to give a clear response.</p>
<p>The Nobel Peace Prize Committee's decision to award the previous Peace Prize to the German pacifist writer Carl von Ossietzky is very appropriate, because Carl von Ossietzky is a pacifist who has contributed to the cause of peace. However, the opposition caused by this matter from the German authorities is not without reason, because Carl von Ossietzky has attacked his country's aggressive policies, which the government cannot tolerate, and he was sentenced to treason. The German authorities cannot tolerate this traitor receiving the Peace Prize.</p>
<p>However, the German authorities' expression of indignation, on the one hand, is enough to expose the new Germany's behavior as incompatible with peace, and on the other hand, it is enough to show that Carl von Ossietzky has contributed to the cause of peace and is worthy of receiving the Peace Prize. Carl von Ossietzky's detention for believing in pacifism is truly an injustice.</p>
<p>I remember that someone once suggested that this year's Nobel Peace Prize should be awarded to the German leader. The reason was that the reason why the European situation can maintain peace today is all the result of the German leader's efforts for the cause of peace. Unfortunately, this proposal was not only not adopted by the Nobel Peace Prize Committee, but the Committee also awarded the previous Peace Prize to the German government's traitor, which is no wonder that it is considered an insult.</p>
<p>Recently, the German Anti-Comintern Pact has been established, and Germany has completed another peace cause. If the Nobel Peace Prize has not yet been decided to be awarded to whom at this time, it is really necessary to consider it. The Argentine Foreign Minister Saavedra Lamas and the German pacifist writer Carl von Ossietzky have already been decided as the winners, and the Peace Prize has already fallen on them. The German authorities' opposition will probably not have any effect.</p>

<h3>Pigeons</h3>
<p>— Lin Jia</p>
<p>Winter Sketch</p>
<p>Winter in the north is often snowy. After the snow stops, the green wheat seedlings that have just emerged from the ground are also buried. The fields are a vast expanse of white, silvery light. Crows perch on the branches of withered trees, leaning over and croaking. Under the gray, overcast sky, the cold wind howls through the streets and lanes. The suburbs are silent, and people are suffocated in their houses. The elderly may be dozing around a charcoal stove. The entire forest is like being covered with a large white felt, sleeping soundly like a good child.</p>
<p>In front of my house, there is an empty courtyard. When the wind and snow stop, my younger brother often takes a small broom to sweep the snow. The snow on the courtyard is pushed to the side of the official road, revealing a flat piece of yellow earth. He puts a basket down, propping it up with a two-foot-high wooden pole. A long hemp rope is tied to the base of the pole and curved all the way to the wood gate. The trap is set. This naughty child makes a joyful face and secretly takes two handfuls of corn from the food jar, scattering them densely on the inside of the basket, and scattering them sparsely on the ground to the entrance of the trap. He then squats behind the wood gate, pulling the rope, and looks up at the movements in the courtyard.</p>
<p>When everything is covered with snowflakes, pigeons always spread their wings and skim low over the ground when they see a patch of yellow soil. Two lively and greedy pigeons discover that there are many scattered yellow particles floating on the ground, so they coo twice and spread their wings, flying and jumping lightly, sipping one or two grains on the edge, and then looking in alarm at the black monster. After bowing their heads again to eat a few grains, there is still no disturbance. The little partners standing on the high wall of the opposite house, staring with their small red eyes and wearing tile-colored robes, also flutter down one by one like withered leaves in the autumn wind. After the particles on the edge are eaten, the bolder ones sip the particles inside one by one. Gradually, they become indifferent, vying to grab the yellow, sparkling particles to eat. After the outside of the basket is completely eaten, they secretly look at the mouth of the basket, which is open like a mouth, and are a little afraid. They fly away from the ground, scouting around. The timid ones jump around on the side, watching the movements. When they return to the ground after scouting, they don't look at anything and go straight to the pile of abundant food inside the basket, sipping like head-bowing insects. The few who were hesitant at the back also bravely turn inward and compete with those partners to eat.</p>
<p>My younger brother tightens the rope in his hand and pulls it sharply to the back. With a soft sound, those who were not trapped scramble to turn around and fly back to the wall. The basket inside rattles. My younger brother happily lifts the special net bag, slightly lifting the mouth of the basket. The net bag is propped open at the opening. When the pigeons see a line of light coming in from the outside, they struggle to drill outward. When they rush out, thinking they are saved, they are caught by my younger brother through a layer of netting.</p>
<p>In the evening, they are killed by the stove and boiled in a pot of boiling water. My father will have wine and dishes the next day.</p>
<h3>Song</h3>
<p>— Li Liwen</p>
<p>Sea, oh!</p>
<p>Sea, oh!</p>
<p>Fish--come on!</p>
<p>Ah-ee-yo--</p>
<p>The fishermen--are laughing.</p>
<p>Sea, oh!</p>
<p>Waves, oh!</p>
<p>In the village by the sea of Cilacap, this song once stirred up my infinite melancholy. At that time, I was sent to the home of a relative there to recuperate because of a brain disease. The relative was a pond owner, owning dozens of ponds. His Western-style wooden house was the most beautiful and magnificent building in the village. From the entrance of the village, looking from a distance, the red roof surrounded by green trees was almost considered the only happy paradise in the village. Many people cast envious glances at it. Children liked to gather on the lawn in front of the door and make all kinds of strange and beautiful dreams about the house. My window faced the lawn. Many times, the singing drove in from the window, gently rippling in the quiet air. At those times, I became intoxicated, quietly lying on the bed, listening to that warm singing making my dreams. Or, I would walk to the beach, stand still on the soft sand, gazing at the vast sea, watching the sea glittering with golden waves in the warm sunlight, and listening to the sea singing softly in the caress of the gentle breeze. …</p>
<p>Soon, I also became familiar with that song. It moistened me, as if a heavy rain had fallen in the great desert. So: in moments of extreme calm, when the wind sent the whispers of leaves and the sea in the night, when looking out the window at the vast, leaping sea, or when the children's singing gently climbed in through the window, I would also sing that song softly.</p>
<p>My illness slowly got better.</p>
<p>However, one day, a great tragedy suddenly happened in the village: only four or five of the fifty-odd fishing boats that went out to sea came back, and the rest were deeply buried in the sea that had risen with big waves. The village was shrouded in an irreparable great sadness. From people's faces, from the corners of children's mouths, it was extremely rare to find that trace of a smile. - The song that intoxicated people's thoughts like a poem no longer rang out.</p>
<p>The relatives were not moved by this atmosphere of sorrow, they still lived the same life. However, in me, my heart trembled, the sea breeze that blew made my head hurt, the rustling leaves and waves in the middle of the night made me seem to hear that song again, and I suffered from insomnia again. My heart fell into the hearts of the villagers. …</p>
<p>A few days later, I wrote a letter to my father, writing my sorrow on every word - so, one morning, I quietly left Cilacap, and returned to the provincial capital of Batavia with a sad heart.</p>
<h3>Effective Medicine for Frostbite</h3>
<p>Swelling disappears on the day it appears, and recovery is achieved within days for those that have festered</p>
<p>Frostbite is caused by the coagulation of stagnant blood. Initially, it is red and swollen, causing unbearable pain and itching. After it has ulcerated, pus drips out, and the pain is even more severe. This condition is especially common in winter, and there is a lack of good remedies in the world, causing patients to suffer. Fortunately, Zhengwei Pharmacy (Yinghua Loan Street entrance, Second Avenue) has invented two kinds of effective medicines: (1) Frostbite Ruyi Water, which specializes in treating unbroken frostbite. Once used, the pain and itching stop immediately, and the redness and swelling disappear immediately; (2) Pearl Baiyu Ointment, which specializes in treating festering frostbite. Once used, it removes decay and generates new flesh, and recovery is achieved within days. The price of Ruyi Water is twenty cents per bottle, and Baiyu Ointment is forty cents per box.</p>
<h3>New Arrivals Hall</h3>
<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<p>We, this suffering group, not protected by our motherland, are now driven into this temporary prison. Many people call this place the "New Arrivals Hall."</p>
<p>This is a rather grand building, with thick cement walls on all sides, embedded with square windows made of iron bars. Now we are completely isolated from the outside world. Just after the last of our companions came in, the iron gate was immediately closed and locked.</p>
<p>The cries of children and women gradually subsided. Many people sat on the damp ground, staring at each other with the expressions of famine refugees. An old woman cried and muttered to herself:</p>
<p>"Why are they locking me in here? Heavens!" She shook her hands in despair. "I haven't committed any crime. Why even bring in an old woman like me who's about to enter the coffin! You descendants doomed to extinction! Where will you tell my Ren'er to find me?"</p>
<p>Her hoarse voice kept ringing, speaking and stopping, stopping and speaking, always pulling up her skirt to wipe her eyes, her hands waving from time to time, as if beckoning someone. Then she began to shout loudly, "You cursed people who deserve to be torn apart by five horses! I'll see how long you keep me locked up! How long you keep me locked up! You childless, grandchildless people! Did I dig up your ancestors' graves in my past life, and smash your ancestors' ash urns?"…</p>
<p>This mournful sound made us tremble. Many people's consciousness was awakened by this fierce voice, and they all began to curse in low voices, the space of the entire room filled with angry sounds.</p>
<p>However, the fact that we couldn't leave until tomorrow morning had already been decided. Although we felt bitterness and injustice in our hearts, our restless emotions finally calmed down slowly, and at the same time, the feeling of hunger also began to rise.</p>
<p>At the thought of this kind of dehumanizing treatment, a surge of indignation suddenly stirred among us again.</p>
<p>"Do they want to starve us to death? Even prisoners get rice to eat! Damn it, are we even considered human?" a young man said. Then he turned around and said to me with a challenging attitude:</p>
<p>"It's really bad luck to be born Chinese! Don't you think the Chinese riding 'horsehair' carriages would have long gone to sea by boat!"</p>
<p>Spiritual Pivot Plain Questions</p>
<p>— Dr. Liu Xinbai Answers</p>
<p>Frequent Urination</p>
<p>No. 107, No. 12, Lane 357, Weihaiwei Road, Mr. Hui Songxian asks: I am currently 29 years old, unmarried, and in good health, with no other diseases, and have never patronized prostitutes. However, whenever the weather is cold, I feel frequent urination. Once I have finished, I need to go a second time in two or three minutes, and then a third, fourth, or even fifth time. This is even worse after drinking soup or water. The amount of urine each time is quite large. It is less at night, but there are still one or two to three or four times. This symptom started four or five years ago. May I ask: (1) Is it kidney deficiency? (2) What is the treatment? (3) Is the Cystex managed by Tongyi Foreign Firm safe and reliable to take?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) It is diabetes insipidus. (2) Eat more nutritious foods, limit drinking water and salt. There is no reliable treatment in drug therapy. (3) I do not know the ingredients of Cystex and cannot comment. (4) Please ask a doctor to distinguish whether there is diabetes and atrophic kidney!</p>
<p>Rosacea on the Face</p>
<p>No. 108, No. 200, Ruihua Lane, Lafayette Road, Mr. Li Yanbo asks: The tip of my nose is often red and has small blisters. When scratched and broken, there is pus and blood. When it is severe, pressing it feels slightly painful inside. Small blisters also appear on my face from time to time, which are commonly known as "rosacea," spotty and appearing one after another, which is very annoying. (1) What is the cause of the two diseases? (2) Is it an internal disease or just a skin disease? (3) How to treat it? What medicine to apply or take? (4) Should I have a blood test?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) The former is called rosacea (Acne Rosaceo), and the latter is called simple rosacea. There are many causes of the former, including congestion, digestive disorders, drinking alcohol, anemia, and abnormal vascular nerves. I do not know which of these five causes you suspect. The latter is caused by increased sebum secretion. (2) It is a skin disease, but it has a considerable relationship with internal diseases. (3) First diagnose what kind of internal disease there is, and then treat this internal disease. Relying solely on topical medication is almost treating the symptoms. Apply "Pixrol Ointment" and inject "Sod. Gacodylate." (4) A blood test should be done to determine whether there is anemia.</p>
<p>Crooked Mouth and Slanted Face</p>
<p>No. 109, Mr. Li Zhongyong asks: I have never engaged in prostitution, but I suffered from a throat ailment last month, which was cured by blood serum injections. Because I followed the doctor's advice, I stayed in bed for more than ten days after the illness. After getting out of bed, I felt mentally depressed and went to Pudong for a stroll. Who knew that I caught a cold on the boat, and the next day, my mouth and eyes were suddenly crooked and slanted, my left face could not move on its own, the corners of my mouth were pulled up, and when I closed my eyes, my mouth was pulled up at the same time, and it was very difficult to close my eyes. Therefore, I would like to ask: (1) What is the name of this disease? (2) How long will it take to recover? (3) What medicine should I take?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) Facial nerve paralysis. (2) At least one week, at most half a year. If it is not cured, it can become a lifelong illness. (3) Take "Endojodin", massage, electrotherapy, warm water compress (or use "Saulloid" for hot compress with the same effect).</p>
<p>Balanitis</p>
<p>No. 110, Mr. Ding Yixin asks: After engaging in prostitution, a small ulcer appeared on the inner surface of my foreskin. Knowing that I was infected with poison, I immediately asked a doctor on Fourth Malu Road to inject 914, which cured it. I thought I was completely cured, so I didn't pay attention. However, a few days ago, many small red spots suddenly appeared all over my body. I plan to go to you for diagnosis and treatment. Please tell me first (1) whether it is syphilis and what stage it is in? (2) What other symptoms should syphilis have? (3) Why is this disease so difficult to cure? (4) What is the radical cure? (5) What will happen if it is not treated?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) Secondary syphilis. (2) Bone pain, hair loss, swollen lymph nodes. (3) This disease is quite difficult to cure radically. (4) First inject 606, one injection per week, for six consecutive injections. At the same time, inject one dozen of "Carbisin", one injection every three days. Rest for two months, and if the blood test is negative, no more injections are needed, but it should still be checked again six months later. If the blood test is still positive (toxic) after two months, it must be injected again as above until it is negative (non-toxic). (5) It depends on the site of invasion: invasion of the brain is cerebral syphilis; invasion of the spinal cord is spinal syphilis; invasion of the liver is liver syphilis. There are many symptoms, which cannot be exhausted in a few words.</p>
<p>Difficulty Breathing</p>
<p>No. 111, Mr. Ren Xingyu, at the intersection of San Malu Road, Henan Road, asks: A relative of mine suffered from chronic heart disease in the winter of 1933 due to overwork. When the disease occurs, he is very breathless, has difficulty breathing, cannot sit or lie down, and can only stand and walk, so his spirit is deteriorating day by day. At first, he sought treatment from Chinese medicine, but it was completely ineffective. Later, he sought treatment from Western doctors ×××, etc., but although he received injections and took medicine, his condition did not improve and became more and more severe, almost to the point of death. Later, on the recommendation of a friend, he went to ×× Hospital to be treated by a Japanese doctor ××, and after a diagnosis, he was able to lie down. After more than ten treatments, he had recovered. However, my relative is obsessed with Chinese medicine, and at the same time, because ××'s medicine is difficult to take due to its spicy taste, he is unwilling to consult the Japanese doctor again, so he sought treatment from Chinese medicine doctor ××× again. At first, it was probably because the disease was in the recovery period, so there was still progress. But when it recurred, the Chinese medicine doctor was also helpless. Going to the Japanese doctor for consultation again, one dose cured it. However, it recurs frequently and cannot be eradicated. For three years, his finances have been depleted, so since the spring of last year, it has been happening about once a month. When it happens, he goes to the Japanese doctor for consultation, and it is cured after diagnosis. But now, sometimes because of financial reasons, he does not seek medical treatment. As a result, it has happened three or four times this month. In between, he went to ×× Hospital and consulted with Dr. ×××, but it was ineffective. In summary, there are several questions, and I sincerely hope that you can provide guidance: (1) According to the Japanese doctor, "The disease is chronic heart disease, starting from the intercostal space, leading to cardiac hypertrophy and difficulty breathing. It is extremely忌諱 to be overworked physically and mentally, as well as smoking, alcohol, and meat. Because it is not treated for a long time, there is no way to cure it so far." I don't know if this is true? (2) Why are the medicines of other Western doctors ineffective, and only the medicines of the Japanese doctor can calm the breath immediately? The taste of the medicine is very numb, and it often causes vomiting after taking it! The "bubble water" utensil turns white when it comes into contact with it. What kind of medicine is it? (3) What medicine is most effective for this disease now?</p>
<p>Answer: Your friend's illness is cardiac asthma, which has many causes, such as angina pectoris, myocarditis, or heart failure. As for (1) what Matsui said, I have not examined it, so of course I cannot criticize whether it is correct, but since he has examined it and made this statement, it should not be wrong. (2) Critiquing a doctor's scholarship cannot be based solely on whether a certain medicine is effective or not. Perhaps ×× has special experience with this disease. All types of fatty and aromatic agents can discolor "泡立水," so based on this alone, it is impossible to infer what medicine it is. (3) Since ××'s medicine is effective, it is appropriate to entrust him with the diagnosis and treatment. If, as you said, "finances are depleted," then taking "Tinctura. Campho. Compound" and "Ephedrin Sulphate 'Star Brand'" internally is also possible. Take one qian of the former and one or two tablets of the latter each time. Pay the utmost attention when taking it!</p>
<p>Pain in Both Sides of the Stomach</p>
<p>No. 112, Mr. Wang Shuzhi asks: My wife has always had irregular menstruation. After seeing your reply to a letter from a certain gentleman, which mentioned taking "Danggui Er," she took several bottles in a row and has completely recovered. But my wife also has stomach pain at the same time, with pain in both flanks, and at a fixed time, that is, from the 13th to the 16th or 17th day after menstruation. During the stomach pain, she rolls around in bed, covered in cold sweat. Although she has consulted doctors for diagnosis and treatment, most of them only relieve the pain temporarily. Therefore, please (1) recommend a good medicine! (2) This pain has been diagnosed by many doctors, and everyone says something different. The so-called national doctors are even more deceitful. After consulting seven national doctors, they came up with seven different diagnoses, and the medicine taken was like a stone sinking into the sea, with no temporary effect at all. Please tell me, what is the name of this disease? (3) What causes it?</p>
<p>Answer! (1) Take "Chatone" and apply "Sanfjoid" hot compress on the abdomen, which is also effective. Usually, it is best to take tonics regularly, such as "Livemin" or inject "Blusen," etc.</p>
<p>Loss of Appetite</p>
<p>No. 113, Mr. Han Muchen asks: I suffered from dysentery two months ago, and later acupuncture and medicine were used, and I recovered in less than a week. But since then, I have often suffered from constipation, loss of appetite, and aversion to rice. Recently, when I looked in the mirror, my face was yellow and thin, and I was completely different from before I was sick, so I am very worried. Please advise on treatment!</p>
<p>Answer: Pay attention to cooking, take "Acit-ose-Pepsin", and when constipated, insert "Glycerin su-ppository" into the anus.</p>
<p>Chronic Leukorrhea</p>
<p>No. 114, Mr. Zheng Bai, Fujian Shouning County Government, asks: I have suffered from leukorrhea for four times, and some have been cured by taking herbal medicine, and some have been cured by injecting "Gonacriudin." But this time, due to excessive sex, the old disease has recurred. I don't know if it is because my body is too weak, or because the woman's genitals are unclean, which often leads to this disease. At the beginning, it was not very painful, and there was not much leukorrhea. Because there is no Western pharmacy in this county, and no doctor to inject, I took six or seven doses of local soil herbal medicine. Now it has gradually recovered, but it cannot be completely eradicated. There is still one or two drops of turbidity leaking out every day and night, and there is no stinging pain when it is yang, as if there is no disease. If this is delayed for a long time, (1) will it affect fertility? (2) Please recommend a good medicine (3) What is the price of oral tablets of Gonacriudin? Please let me know as well.</p>
<p>Answer: You and your wife have chronic gonorrhea. When you think you are cured, you are not actually cured, but the gonorrhea is only temporarily dormant and does not show symptoms. The disease will recur when the opportunity arises (such as drinking or overwork). As for the so-called "body is too weak" and "female genitals are unclean," it is irrelevant. (1) This disease alone does not harm fertility, but when men cause prostatitis, orchitis, and seminal vesiculitis, and women cause oophoritis, fertility is hopeless. (2) Chronic gonorrhea cannot be treated solely by oral medicine. Please use "Argonnacrindin" to wash, twice a day, for one month continuously, without interruption. Stop having sex during this treatment period to prevent mutual infection and hinder healing. (3) I don't know the price of oral tablets of Gonacriudin.</p>
<p>Ringworm</p>
<p>No. 115, Mr. Qian Qing asks: I was careless and don't know where I got dry ringworm on my buttocks and inner thighs. It is extremely itchy. Please advise on treatment.</p>
<p>Answer: Apply "10% Spiritus Acid Salicylic".</p>

<p>I didn't answer. My heart felt as if it was blocked by something, so sad. That young man went over to the other side again after a while and started talking to some other people.</p>
<p>Gradually, some fellow villagers living in the area appeared outside the window. They brought us some food and tea. They comforted us with optimistic words:</p>
<p>"Fellow villagers, be patient and wait! We have tasted this suffering before. What can we do? There's no use being anxious, you can come out tomorrow morning. Alas, we can only blame our China for being weak!"</p>
<p>In addition to the sincere comfort, we also received two red bean buns and a cup of tea. The sincere love of our compatriots really moved us. That kind of hostile attitude towards me in the motherland has now completely disappeared without a trace. For the first time, I felt the love of my compatriots.</p>
<p>Until the scorching sun disappeared from the eastern walls, a huge swarm of mosquitoes appeared. In the stiflingly hot house, mixed with the cries of children and the scolding and sighs of adults, there was also the buzzing sound of mosquitoes. I felt an incomparable restlessness and depression. The shadow of my beautiful hometown reappeared in my heart. At this moment, I realized how lovable our mother earth was. Although there is hunger and oppression there, the amount of freedom is always much more than here. I looked at the twinkling starlight outside the skylight and couldn't help but shed tears.</p>
<p>"What if our motherland could protect us?" I thought sadly in my heart, but I don't know when this hope will be realized.</p>
