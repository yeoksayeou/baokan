<h3>浙江之瓷器</h3>
<p>— 陳萬里</p>
<p>浙江造瓷之見於記載的，在晋曰標，在唐曰越，曰秘色，曰婺州，在宋曰哥，曰龍泉，曰修內司官窰，曰郊臺下新窰，還有所謂泉山窰等等名稱。</p>
<p>就已往的情形說，龍泉瓷器，最負盛名。然而上至鑑賞收藏之士大夫，下至輾轉販賣之古董行商，亦祗曉得龍泉兩個字；並且談到龍泉，捨梅于靑三字外，又別無可說。見聞之陋，眼光之小，眞是十足表示出生在一個閉關時代的　預樣子。</p>
<p>最近數年來，由於郊臺下新窰的發見，由於龍泉兩個字已不足以賅括各地的出品，而另又發現了大窰，竹口，楓堂，新亭，各處的窰基。（見拙著靑磁之研究）由於餘姚上林湖附近出十碎片的哄動在杭州市塲，於是一般人方才大夢初醒，曉得在浙江有如許多的窰口，有如許多可以寶貴的古代遺物，打破昔日僅僅以龍泉窰代表浙江古代瓷器的謬見，這的確是對於認識浙江瓷器方面的一個大進步。</p>
<p>其實，不祗這一點，餘姚上林湖的越器，以五代錢氏的倡導，爲了屢屢供奉底目的而大量生產，（見拙著越器之史的研究）由此關係，使得越器的制作，在中國瓷器史上做到了一步空前啟後的工作。（見拙著越器圖錄序）前乎此者，在技巧上說，沒有像牠那樣精緻成熟，圖案方面，也沒有像牠那樣繁複，因此越器之在中國瓷器史上，有牠燦爛的一頁，也就可以說浙江造瓷之於中國瓷器史上，是佔據了極光榮的地位。</p>
<p>嗣後龍泉崛起，由早期的制作一直到了明代，不僅是充分供給了民間的需要，而且因爲外輸的關係，使得浙江龍泉瓷器的聲譽遠播國外。最近由於龍泉各處窰基的　見，曉得當時生產數量的可驚，以及造瓷技巧的進步。此外在南宋偏安的局面之下，產生了郊臺官窰的最精美最名貴底作品，這在中國瓷器史上，實在開闢了南方制作官窰的一個新底紀元。</p>
<p>因爲有了越器，有了龍泉，有了南宋官窰，浙江的造瓷，可以說是到達了黃金時代。在北方之所謂邢，定，均，汝，磁，各窰，固然都很有名，可是究竟北方勝過了南方，還是南方勝過了北方，實在不容易分別出高下來。就以北方的邢器說，雖則到現在還沒有發見，邢瓷的審基，可以見到邢瓷的眞相，然而在當時的品評，已有邢不如越之說。定器花紋極繁耨，可與五代時之越器相抗。南宋修內司官窰邵成章所主者尚未發見其窰基）及郊臺新窰，據說都是沿襲舊京遺製，應與汴梁的制作，不能有什麽分別。總之在此數百年間，南北兩方面，確實是分道揚鑣，各　身手，北方以河北河南爲中心，南方却獨在浙江，其他各窰之在別省的，祗能算是浙江的附庸。因此一來，浙江的造瓷，不僅是在中國瓷器史上有一頁光榮的地位，我可以大胆地肯定說浙江的造瓷，是跟着北方的造瓷，平分占據了這一個時期的歷史。所以如其不談史實則已，要講的話，浙江的造瓷，在已往的歷史方面是極重要的。</p>
<p>從此，吾們向來祇曉得所謂柴，汝，官，哥，定五大窰的一句老套底話，是根本的打破了。並且由此五大窰的一句話裏，把浙江的造瓷向來是被抹煞了的，也由此有了翻身之日。</p>
<p>可是最近事實還告訴吾們說，浙江的造瓷，不祗是爭得了這一點在歷史上的地位與光榮，而未來的新底發見，却一天一天地增加起來。例如紹興九巖窰廟下窰窰基的發現；因爲漓渚項里古壙的開發，黃龍太康元康磚以及元和墓誌磚等等的實物，證明了九巖窰餘姚越器的年代；我於湖州金華等處，又找到了好幾處窰基，這些，都是極重要的事。不曉得要在已往的浙江造瓷史上開拓出多少奇蹟！</p>
<p>所以綜起來說，浙江的造瓷，經過了近年來不斷地種種發見以後，一方面是證實了牠在瓷器史上的重要性，同時因爲許多新的窰基，新的證明，又是方興未艾地陸續發現出來，彷彿是一個未經開採的鑛，蘊藏着多少富源，留待吾人之努力。我很希望以研究爲目的的同志們，不要輕輕放過這一個千載難逢的機會。</p>

<h3>美國新門羅主義與中國</h3>
<p>— 隅</p>
<p>自從羅斯福在本屆的美國選舉重被他國內的選民擁了上台繼任總統以後國內國外有許多政論家發表了高明的推測說是羅斯福在他的第二屆任內對於遠東問題將有些「顏色」顯給世界人看是的有些「顏色」顯給世界人看是我們所樂意聽到的可是我們且慢沾沾自喜自一九三二年到目前羅斯福做美國元首快近四年美國所給我們的實惠不過幾决空頭的宣言也許有人要講過去四年美國為空前的不景氣所牽累忙於內政無暇他顧現在美國的經濟已經好轉羅斯福這决再為其選民所擁護他的「領導世界和平所處的地位將較前屆民主黨總統威爾遜更為有力」只要看到他八月中旬的和平演說指斥破壞條約的帝國主義渚只要看到九月下旬美國國務卿赫爾聲明繼續維持史汀生的不承認中義就可知道他的對遠東外交政策或者將有更積極的表示此外羅氏在重行獲選以後對於十二月間在阿根廷京城波諾愛爾舉行的汎美會議預備親自出馬這也可見羅斯腦擁護和平的熱誠汎美會議主要的任務有締結中立公約保持美洲和平設立商務委員會與中立國得自由限制及禁化與交戰國貿易等項而共主要的目的據有些人分析共有兩個一個自然是使西半球避免捲入歐洲行將發生的戰爭還有一個乃是成立聯合經濟戰綫制裁東方侵略國因為日本的商業决不是可以賴中國一地就能使其商品不過剩的它需要美洲的市塲它需要英屬各自治領各殖民地的市塲英日經濟衝突的結果英國各屬地已經實行排斥日貨給日本嚴重的打擊如果美洲再有聯合的抵制使其遭受更大的打擊這對於日本也未始不是一種制裁</p>
<p>這樣的觀察固然言之成理不過我們不要忘記美國對南美的所謂睦鄰政策按其實質並非着力於和平的觀點而是一種門羅主義的新姿態美國想獨占南美的市塲而把其他一切國家尤其是英國的經濟勢力排斥於美洲之外換句話說美國失去了遠東的市塲而謀補償於南美這樣英美之間就必要引起更嚴重的經濟利益的衝突英美在遠東的不會合作其原因固不止一端然而美國這種新門羅中義我們也不能不承認是主要原因之一前天東京方面傳出消息說日美在太平洋的勢力衝突不如日英衝突利害而英美在太平洋勢力衝突雖微而在美洲衝突較烈這種觀察我們不能說他完全屬於片面的宣傳其中是不無見地的</p>
<p>英美小能合作旣一如往昔那末羅斯福今後的外交當然多半是如以往一樣完全囿於他的以往的衣缽而無本質上的改變的從我們的立塲要希望靠美國外交上的援助來恢復我們所失的權益實在等於痴人的妄想不過講到這兒我得聲明的我並不是講外交沒有用我的意思是講在疆土日削的情况之下不自謀積極的辦法而徒靠他人之出而維護所謂正義來保全我們的主權和疆土是絕對不可能的如果我們下了决心則世界視聽才可為之一轉血人之待我亦會刮目相看然而這就看我們今日的决心究竟如何了</p>

<h3>章十接見記者　暢談北方現狀　謂翼察安綏東亦無虞　並否認翼察設最高分院</h3>
<p>冀察政務委員會委員兼法制委員會主席章士釗氏、前日由平飛滬、弔唁段祺瑞氏、預定在滬作一星期之勾留、卽將北返、章氏曾於昨午在寓接見新聞記者作下列之談話、</p>
<p>翼察安　　綏東無虞</p>
<p>據章氏談、北方之現狀、實不如南方人所想像之危險、冀察境內、頗爲安謚、雖有一種隱藏之危機、然此種危機、中國其他各地、亦無不有之、而此種危機、何時爆發、及爆發於何地、吾人固難加以預測也、偽蒙匪烏合之衆、進擾綏東、據本人觀察、决可無虞、蓋傅主席（作義）之實力、足以消滅匪衆而有餘、决不致令其蔓延也、</p>
<p>法制委會　即將改組</p>
<p>冀察法制委員會、係於中央法制系統之下、討論冀察適用之法制、換言之、卽爲討論冀察之單行法也、過去法制委員會主席一職、係由河北高等法院院長鄧哲熙氏兼任、是故法制委員會與法院打成一片、至於此後、法制委員會與法院之關係、尚待研商、冀察政委會所屬各委員會均將改組、法制委員會如何改組及委貝之數額暨人選、均待本人北返後再行决定、</p>
<p>無設最高　分院之意</p>
<p>我國土地廣大、人口衆多、因之最高法院所受理之案伴、異常繁多、迄今積壓之案件、幾達萬件、積壓達一年之久、而迄未處理者、亦屬不少、故在理論上、最高法院實有設立分院之必要、然事實上、最高法院固並不許可設立分院、試觀東北與西南之最高分院之先後撤銷、卽可證明、外傳冀察將設立最高分院之說、實非確詞、我人固絕未考慮及此也、</p>
<p>留滬一周　即將北返</p>
<p>本人此來、專爲弔唁段芝泉先生、並無其他任務、預定作一星期之勾留、卽將北返、</p>
<h3>王唐　昨離滬赴崑山</h3>
<p>冀察政務委員會委員王揖唐、於前日抵滬、弔唁段祺瑞氏之喪、在滬僅留一宵、業於昨晨八時乘早特快車離滬、聞係因事赴崑山、是否將再來滬、抑卽北返未定、</p>
<h3>宋子良　在滬尚有勾留　傳昨晚乘輪南旋不確</h3>
<p>粵財政特派員兼財廳長宋子良、自九月三十由粵飛滬、謁晤孔財長、報告並請示一切、滯滬已久、傳宋氏昨晚乘輪南旋云云、並非事實、據宋宅消息、宋氏在滬尚有相當勾留云、</p>
<h3>一日運動　宣傅剛要　購機祝壽會訂定　分送播音臺宣傳</h3>
<p>航空救國獻機祝壽一日運動、爲擴大宣傳、特擬定一日運動官傳綱要、分送各播音臺、各遊藝塲所、按日摘要宣傳、茲探其綱要如左、</p>
<p>緣起　本市獻機祝壽捐欽、預定一百萬元、購機十架、編爲中正隊、呈獻政府、爲蔣委員長五十壽辰紀念、迨壽期已屆、核計所收捐欵、已達六十餘萬元、不敷尚多、當由吳市長向中央商洽、先將定機十架飛滬命名、不足之數、繼續慕足補繳、各界人士、聆此消息、紛起贊助、於是有「以一日貢獻國家運動」之產生、先有旅業公會姚頌年君、向本會建議、繼由立報著論倡導、復經市商會主席王曉籟先生、於本市舉行獻機命名典禮時、臨時動議、引起全國注意與同情、現此項運動、不獨普及於全滬、且已遍及於全國、可見我全國國民、對於國家之願望與認識矣、</p>
<p>意義　國家的存亡利害、就是全國人民的存亡利害、人民要保障自己的生活和安全、就必須要羣策羣力、維護整個國家、整個民族使不受任何損害、可是要達到此目的、必須要先充實國家的國防、尤其是國防中最重要的空防、我們以「一日貢獻國家運動」、就是鑒於國難嚴重、外侮緊迫、各盡能力、貢獻國家、充實航空、鞏固國防、表演力量、爲外交後盾、爭民族生存、一日運動之意義、卽在於是、</p>
<p>辯法　全市各界同胞、均應以一日所得之工資薪給、貢獻國家、至於公司商號、如能將一日營業所得、貢獻國家固佳、否則可將一日營利所得、酌量提成、各盡心力、不計多寡、提捐日期决定、或登報通告、或函達本會商會査照、並於舖面標明、以資鼓吹、捐得之欵、可逕送八仙僑青年會本會或送由商會及各業公會與各大報館代爲收轉亦可、</p>
<p>標語　「以一日貢獻國家」、這是做非常時期國民的最低限度犧牲、用全國一日的力量、來充實國防、用全國一日的精神、來保衛民族、「一日」數目不多、集合全國「一日」的數目卽多、一人一日的力量不大、集合全國　萬萬五千萬人一日的力量卽大、願同胞勿放過此「一日」、實行犧牲此一日」、上海市募欵購機祝壽紀念委員會、</p>

<h3>魏璐克極贊　中國民航進步　魏氏定期回美</h3>
<p>駐華英大使署航空委員魏璐克氏在滬辦公、已閱三載、對於中國航空發展、多所擘畫、而對於最近英飛艇抵滬、及完成汎美航空公司剪風號在香港設立根據地之英美協定、允爲出力、近由英政府調回本國、任帝國防務專校敎授、日內即將啟程返國履新、數日前</p>
<p>魏氏曾偕其繼任員寇璧氏同游華北、繼復至杭州遊覽、對於中國商業航空之進步、印象甚佳、寇氏近年曾服務新加坡美國空軍根據地、其來滬之前、曾視察英國最新式工廠與航空錢、覺中國於商業航業、有重要進步、魏氏擬於下星期一日、偕其夫人、乘加拿大皇后號、先至美國、赴白法洛、參觀寇蒂斯拉愛特飛機廠、然後由紐的乘船返英、魏氏對於中國航空前途、甚具希望、而對於　港將爲有世界關係之航空終點、允爲關切、</p>

<p>申報文藝專刋傷兵  李輝英　　那時候我正住在一條大胡同里，每天的日子過得不忙不閑的。我所以要在胡同之上加個「大字，原因很簡單，那是因爲胡同本身不但很爲寬大，就連人馬車輛的往來也異常繁多，熱鬧程度正不在一條大街之下，所不同的不過沒有幾家買賣舖商罷了。　　我時常有機會在胡同里走一走，因爲到街上去買東西或是辦事情，全不能拋開道條胡同另走別路，儘管左近地方很有些其他的小胡同也可行走，但走起來全沒有這條胡同方便。　　胡同的東口交會在一條南北貫通的大街上，從那里往南一拐，就可以看得見大街路東的一個「商塲」，因爲其中集合諸種商店在一處，買什麼東西全可以在那所面定的範圍之內買得到，顧各絡繹不絕，所以塲里塲外非常熱鬧；我們的胡同旣然靠近商塲，一個熱鬧的處所，西來的人全不能越過道條主要的道路，另尋捷徑，間接着也就帮助了胡同本身增長了它的繁華。　　那一天我正需要　街上去辦事，在午後三點鐘時就出了家門，街上的風非常大，每一陣風刮過之後，就捲過來一陣塵土和飛沙，偶一閉慢了眼睛，就迷得半天半晌睜不開，而且，因爲空氣乾燥，呼吸困難，嗓子里簡直是難過極了，若不是我有必需辦理的事情，我眞要返身走進自己的大門。我怕風，我怕塵土和飛沙，然而這座古城中又偏不缺乏道些特別的產物。當我走到臨近胡同東口那里的時候，在風塵灰沙中猛然看見一隻汚黑的手伸到我的面前，同時一種乞求的聲音也來了：「先生，我是一個傷兵，請你行行方便，施捨一兩大枚，先生，請你可憐可憐我罷。　　我仔細一看，看到前面道旁有一個跪着爬行的殘廢者，他缺少的是兩條腿。他穿一身破舊的灰軍衣，兩枝拐杖拐在胳膊肘下，他的臉色灰土土的沒有光彩，似乎久未擦上一把水。照他的說法和這身穿戴上來淪定，他應該是一個傷兵。他旣然擋住了我的前路，我就不得不停住了脚步。我正自不知如何應付的時候，只見他拉出一副笑臉來，點頭行禮又開始了他的要：「先生，我是一個傷兵，可憐可憐我罷，現在沒有辦法，人受傷旣然不死，就不能不活。　　我把右宇伸進衣袋中去，摸了兩個大枚，可是我並沒有就遞給他，我想起來這城中似乎有什麼殘廢軍人敎養院似的，那里專門收留傷兵，他到院里去，總比在街上乞討要好得多。而且我看送給他一兩大枚，也不是久計，這並不是高妙的辦法。　　「你不是可以到殘廢軍人敎養院去麼，」，我說道，「院里面有吃有穿，强起你有今天無後日的自已天天到街上來乞討。」　　「先生，我是一個傷兵，請你修修好事罷，先生，修修好事罷。」　　他就如沒有聽見我給他供獻的意見，依然說着他的老套，道可使我老實有點生了氣，—爲什麼要這樣糾纏着別人呢。我大聲說：「這兩大枚的好事我是可以修修的，不過我想這並不是久遠之計！我剛剛跟你說的話不是很好麼，你怎麼不理我？」　　他笑了，因爲他看到了我摸出來的兩個大枚，他回答道：一先生，我還能不想找享福的地方麼。跟你說，那里也不容易進，限制很嚴，再說，進去之後，出入全不自由，這有多麼苦惱！我老實不願受那種氣，我身子受了傷，心可沒有死，有機會來時我還想冉幹幹呢。」　　他這話是眞是假，我可猜不出，可是我忍不住問道：「那麼你說須幹幹，可是要幹什麼事情？到軍隊里去？身子不行了。」　　「不行也要幹，只看機會來不來。先生，打仗的事情不一定上前綫，在後方幹事那也是打仗。我不能衝鋒陷陣，我可以在後方看堆。」　　接着，他灰土土的臉上浮起一片興奮的光芒，他不厭絮煩地講了下去，述說他受傷的故事：「先生，吿訴你，我是在喜峯口受的傷，這是因爲保衛國家的原故啊，受傷之後，就回到後方來了。身子受了傷，我不懼怕，這倒堅固了我的志向，我無時無刻不想那一回事，就是等機會一來，好再跟那些人幹幹。能幹是要幹幹。說起來那年咱們的大刀隊，可不知砍死了多少敵人，可是這些事情全過去了，現在一想起來，我就覺得生氣，越生氣，越想再幹幹。」　　一般人說討飯人的話十成有九成假，但對於這面前的殘廢者，我不想爲了要施捨兩大枚而妄加測斷，他若是個爲國傷身的勇士，那自然很値得欽敬；卽或他是說了一套假話，那也盡可由他自去，殊不必爲此多化費一些有用的時間，我還有我該辦的事情，我不能多停留一刻這使我雖然很有意思想再同他談談戰地的情况，也只有暫時作罷了。我把拿在手中的兩大枚遞給他逕自走了。　　當我坐上電車時，讓我想起來一句成話，那成話其實也可以說是一個故事，「一將成名萬骨枯，」這情形一點也不錯。若果這成名的事情是爲了民族的生存，爲了要解除套在脖頸　諸種被壓迫的困難和束縛，這絕對不該誹議，反而是値人贊助敬仰的；但如果藉此專爲爭取個人的名利，那就是欺騙，卑鄙的汚點！　　幾年來，我曾經看見過好多軍士們陣亡的紀念塔，每决全給我想起道同一的問題，同時還呌我想到那些深埋在土內的孤魂，他們爲了某個人造成了功名而犧牲了自己的性命多麼可憐！　　第二天，我又上了一决街，恰巧又讓我碰見這個傷兵，他依然又伸出手，依然又說出他和昨天說過的那一套求乞話。我說：「昨天你不是跟我要過兩大枚麼，怎麼今天你又伸出手來？」　　「昨天是昨天」他毫不介意地說，「我的苦處天天有啊。」　　「那麼你還要幹幹不呢？你能再回答我一决麼？」　　「一直到死，我不會忘記那一回事情，我止爲那事苟延着自己的生命。」　　第三天，在同一時間內我又到胡同東口去，這回打算同他好好談一談，可是我再也我不到他的影子。有一個警察站在那里，我明白了。我不覺就爲一個傷兵不幸的命運而替他担起心來，他是連討飯的自由也沒有了。他究吾是個傷兵，我全不必理會，而他那要幹幹的精神，想來並不一定是什麼「謊言」，誰也不該因爲他的身位而卑視他的這種志願。望望眼前的警察，想想那被逐的傷兵，我的內心里閃出一番無限的感動來。薰風樓（註一）  宋之的　　關於「薰風樓」，是有着各種不同的傳說的，其一：是說在黃巢造反以前，有一隻紅冠子的雄雞，突然從天外飛來。落在樓頭，長啼三聲，使得小百姓全躭了心思。之後不久，果然黃巢就殺了來，結果雖終被河中節度使王仲榮所擊敗，但郤殺了無數的小百姓，甚至把黃河的水全染紅了。據說爲了抵抗黃巢，王仲榮在出發以前，會立樓頭對大家演說，發誓道：「不退黃巢，則全家必死於此。」所以勝利以後，邀宴表功的時候，爲了紀念這不幸的事件，便把這樓題爲「薰風」，以示今後的永遠吉祥。　　另一，那郤更古遠了。說是舜帝也曾在這樓頭擺宴以賀歲的。那時候，大禹剛剛治過水，天下自然是非常太平。大家在酒酣耳熱之餘，均覺得薰風拂面，景狀昇平，甚至鳳凰也跑來凑熱鬧。於是舜帝一高興，就把這樓賜名「薰風」，也不過是表揚太平的意思。　　所以這樓雖說已經很古老，磚石全頹坍了。但骨子裏郤有一件更古老的東西，摸不淸，看不見，郤永遠活在附近一帶的居民心裏。　　這說起來確實是有些神秘的。每年四個節季，淸明，端午，中秋，新年，這薰風樓上就擠滿了人。卽使那樓頭衰敗的木石會咯喳咯喳的嚮，也不會使登樓的人受絲毫的影響。他們多半是携了香燭紙錢，在樓上焚燒禮拜，一面嘴裏咕嚕些「保佑平安」的話。遠遠的望起來，人頭如蟻，香烟繚繞，倒也有些薰薰然的感覺。　　就在平常的時候，那薰風樓上的一磚一瓦，也全蒙滿了紅布條之類的擺飾。上面寫着一些歌功頌德的話，下欵落着弟子某某等等。彷彿那樓上，眞住着什麼仙道似的。這仙道究竟是從什麼時候什麼地方遷到這樓上，並且深深的打動了人心，我們是無從知道的。只知道這向着樓頂磕頭的事，已成了一種風俗，一種習慣，世代相傳，很久遠了。　　但今年，一九三六年的淸明節，情形郤有些兩樣起來了。樓洞裏雖仍然有些擺小攤的在談古道今，但樓上郤像添丁一樣的添了一個守望的兵，兵的背上且負着搶。常常舉起手向着遠方瞭望，那樣子，很有些不可一世。於是人們開始懷疑而且憂慮了。　　「你說這是？」　　「看吧，天下就要大亂的！」　　那兵，卽使有時候也下樓走走，但郤總是要绷着臉，且把眼睛，生氣一樣的釘着每個人。人們從被釘以至就感到某種恐懼，而畏縮的躱開了。有時，擺小攤的雖也曾試探的說：　　「老總，來坐坐吧！」　　「抽棵九台山（註二）來談談吧！」　　但回答却老是微笑着搖搖頭，爲什麼要站在樓上去，那兵像寶藏着一件珍珠似的，寳藏在他的心底。人們無從知道，就更加不安了。　　淸明節，是鬼的季侯。人們爲了尊敬祖先，也許還爲了別的一點什麼，到這一天，全要流點淚，磕點頭，並且燒點紙錢，才算了却心願，可得太平無事。那流淚，磕頭，且燒紙的地方，則多半是在神主前，墳地裏，或者薰風樓。　　可是薰風樓的泥墻上，却在前一天，貼出了吿示。「照得」什麼的一大堆，結果不過是命令居民不得無故登樓。於是不安更加擴張了。　　「究竟爲了什麼？」　　「我說，天下一定要大亂的！」　　人民由於那固執的習慣，也曾試探着步上那石梯，但總是才走到半中，就可以聽到一聲斷喝：　　「滾下去！」　　薰風縷　人們的心裏，更覺得神秘了。　　傍晚的時候，那兵也許是由於疲倦，下樓來了。擺小攤的才噠訕着要講話。忽見有一個人影走上樓去，立刻心裏跳兩下，就蒼白了臉：　　「這下可眞要出事情了！」　　那人是否是遠地的過路人，在淸明節的時候，思念起家鄕，而登樓憑弔呢？是否爲了那古老的遺留，不登樓磕頭卽不得放心呢？人們無由知道。只知道不一會兒，那人便被兵採進縣府裏去了　　這一下，可更增重了人們的恐怖和焦慮。　　「怎麼回事？」　　「誰？」　　「一定是…」　　「天下已經亂了！」　　以後多少大，沒人敢思想這件事。那兵仍然來站崗臉色更嚴重了。　　其後不久，縣府裏父出了吿示。說是抓住了匪，來乘隙偷窺城內地勢，以定攻取。立刻，謠言像烽火一樣的燃起來，人們陷在混亂裏了　　只有那擺小攤的，才見人就苦喪着臉。　　「是寃枉的，一定是寃枉的。」　　落後又說：　　「匪還在此樓，有千八百地呢？」　　但對於薰風樓，卽連那那　小攤的，也遷了地方，像躱避災難一樣的躱開了。　　註一：薰風樓，在山西安　縣。相傳為舜建都地。　　註二：五台山，山西土產香烟。五四時代的傷疤  　　　騎士之歌  大保　　西班牙，英勇的騎十的國度。　　堂·吉訶德曾經在這裏唱過正義之歌。　　西班牙的騎士是「理想的忠僕」，　　仗熱情，仗長劍敢去削平世間的强權。　　他英雄的姿態，跨過依伯利安半島的山嶺，　　他昂揚的歌聲，震撼古今戰士的靈魂。　　西班牙，熱愛正義的民族，　　歐羅巴，是他首先揭起了正義的旗幟。　　但是，歐羅巴也有陰謀的國度，　　逃亡的將軍帶領他們干涉民衆自己表决的政權。　　兩條戰綫，　　在西班牙展開了猛烈的决鬥！　　瑪德里總動員。　　人民戰綫播音號召　　守衛勝利與自由—　　礦工，民團，義勇軍，　　從司令部，兵工廠，武裝庫……　　拿出了槍枝；　　從博物院，從陳列館……　　拿出了槍枝；　　憑熱情，憑勇敢，　　土槍也成爲爭取正義的武器！照相的美與眞  徐訏　　照相要「美術」還是要「像眞」？這個問題是費解的，不過我想，如果從歷史方面講，自然是先要求像而後冉要求美的，這同繪畫一樣，古典主義不是要求精確像眞嗎？所以「像眞」是在「美術」以前的，但是旣然美了，是不是還要求「像眞」，這就成了問題。有人拿美術照相來問我：「這是不是像我？」他的要求自然是「像」，但旣然要求「像」，那還照什麼「美術」？　　事實上「像眞」與「美術」，二者是不妨共存，但前者是客觀的，以對象爲主，後者是主觀的，以作者爲主。這不但人像如此，風景照也是一樣，如果你要在照相下標出「三潭印月」，那麼你理該拍出三潭。在上海北站，有京滬滬杭沿綫的照片，都註出地右景右，這只是客觀的紀載而已，假如有點美，那也只是屬於風景，而不屬於照相的。所以這就引起許多攝影家的批評，以爲這是毫無價値的東西，據說黃山的風景最合畫意，但攝影名作都只見書意而不見黃山，那麼你就題些。。「一片詩意」之類的名字好了，可是一定要寫名「黃山」什麼，這就有點不知所云。用一二枝亂山也可以配成詩意之山水氣韻，而必須在黃山取景，足見攝影師還只能斷章取義的抄襲，而沒有什麼整個的創造。其實照相要說到藝術，到極端就不必用什麼鏡箱，只要棉絮紙張在晒紙上佈置一下，晒晒就可以成爲名作的。而必需實地取景，也還是在寫實。那麼爲什麼寫實之外，又要弄得虛玄起來呢？　　這個問題，在美學原則有一個根據，就是所謂美的距離。所謂美的距離，就是說任何美的東西，必需保住一個距離，否則太接近了就破壞了美；海浪極美，但太近了就會使你發生怕感，於是就無所爲美。畫幅用鏡框，彫像用座台都是爲與人的實世界保持一個距離的緣故。那麼把照相照得虛玄自然也是保住美的距離，可是如果所照是人相，而這個人是大家認識的，那麼這個距離自然算已是破壞了。所以站在美的立塲上，所照的相就是要人家不認識的，要人家不認識，這個辦法很多，而且也很容易辦到，可是被照的人就有問題，去照相的人，雖然願意自己美，但終不願意看不出自己，例外的變態的心理也有，雖然不是自己，但也可相信他是自己，這事情就同色盲的人一樣，完全無法辯明的。可是卽使在照相中看不出是誰，而還有破壞距離的問題，那就是照成太肉感，或有太可憐，容易使人動感情，許多摩登裸體及襤褸乞丐照相都是有道個毛病的。所以站在這個美學立塲上，照人像是最不美的事情，照得多麼模糊與虛玄，也難保住這美的距離的。照風景相也是一樣，被人家認得是什麼地方，或者被人家猜疑是什麼地方都是破瓖美的距離的。在繪畫上有什麼立體派象徵派的產生，其在美學上的根據也就是爲保持美的距離，照相要維持藝術的尊嚴，說句笑話，或者還是漏光的底片是最尊嚴的。　　其實盡點寫眞主義的職責，照相是最好的工具，那麼問題就在於取材與構圖；可是直至現在，新聞攝影記者不像文壇上有左右翼之分，這個事實我到現在還奇怪着。　　照人像要捉摸一僩人的個性，那就是說，不但要照出其人之形，還要照出其人之精神；這是寫實主義者該努力的地方。現在一派寫意派的攝影師，以美爲表率，照相以不像爲貴，弄到招生的大學不收美術照了；可是美術照與非美術照的界限是非常難分，旣沒有一定的分法，廣義與狹義，就可以「失之毫釐差之千里」的。假如嚴格一點說，像上海一班的攝影店，用活動的燈光來配人的面部之光綫，實是都可說是美術照了，這些照相如果都不收，那末學生進大學，只好到小城小鎭去照；而那面是有傳統的眉淸目秀面白手直的古訓的，這樣一個推動，是不是要使中國照相術開倒車回到古典主義上。我想中國照相的寫實運動應當起來了。　　事實上，照相的應用並不限於人像與風景以及靜物，在科學一方面，小至病理學細菌學，大至天空的星球，以及犯罪學與軍事問牒等等，無不以照相爲精確的工具；照相的應用，在這里是只要精確而不要美術的。而且現在精確的成度已經因人在科學的努力，而到了高度的進展。　　所以照相領域中，「像眞」與「美術」已經，而且越將趨於大衆不能碰頭的極端，像眞只要精確，不要美術，美術也就不要像眞，可是因此爲難了人像，又要像眞而還要美術！這是使人這個可憐的動物又陷於這矛盾的境界中了。　　其實以藝術來論，悲劇是藝術，老頭子可以入塑像，褸襤的乞丐也可以入畫，那末照相的美醜，於被照者之美醜不是沒有什麼關係麼？可是人像常不是以「像」爲鑑賞對象，而是以像中之「人」爲鑑賞對象的，而鑑賞者也不止是像外之人，更重要的還是像中之人呢！麻煩點也許就在此。東京通信日本詩壇一風景  雷石楡　　在一切都商品化的資本主義社會，尤其是資本主義祉會悽凉地沒落着的現在，文學相伴而退嬰着（那些受壓迫和摧殘的更不用說）决不是偶然的。在日本雖未做出德國焚書坑儒的堂皇榜樣，然實同名異的把戲怕不會遜色吧。　　進步的作家和出版者被壓得差不多喘不過氣那且不說，就是一般「無傾向」的作家們在還不景氣的環境裏也會大嘆筆墨難換米炊呢。　　然感到最受成脅的是詩人，怪不得室生犀星悲歎一句「詩啊！永別了！」竟轉向到小說去了。而曾是個中錚錚者的中野重治，老擱了詩筆，現在倒這樣自白：我自己仍想作爲詩人而出馬，不過現在不寫而已。又說：我要寫，接着又說現在沒有好詩。這樣的矛盾不澈底，我想，室生會捧着肚皮笑吧？　　然而除了作爲御用文學家出其風頭以外，一般小說家也不見得那個。　　不知是爲了要使文壇熱鬧一下，還是有某種用意，記得去年鬧了一决莫明出處的文藝懇話會賞，詩人沒有資格參加且不用說，就是小說家島木健作因是某種關係，而罷免他受賞的權利。　　那把戲這樣玄妙又這樣露骨，實在値不得嘵舌，而詩人們如小熊秀雄，後藤郁子等，竟憤慨得什麼似的，大加戲嘲了。　　尤其是以詩爲單戀對象的小熊秀雄，不但在詩作上或詩論上潑婦似的諷刺和抨擊輕視時的人，連小說家也做了他指桑駡槐的對象了。　　然而値得憤慨的還是數月來的事。那是大宅壯一「暴論」日本詩人的「認識不足」。他說詩是包莖文學，皰瘡文學，空地文學。「他警吿詩人「如不抽出靑春發動機底的情緒，使之愈益成爲批判的東西，那麼已沒有詩的形式了。」　　是的，詩的確需要有批判精神，然溶合於批判精神中的情緒，决不是如未認識人生社會的深鎖閨房的林黛玉式之純情底靑春發動。日本的新興詩雖然接近散文式，但决不能說這種詩是「包莖文學，皰瘡文學，空地文學。」　　自然主義時代的詩人萩原朔太郞也自吿奮勇的不披甲　地闖進戰塲了，然而他沒有痛擊大宅的「暴論」，只是以詩人的老資格來勸戒時人。不，也同樣非難前進詩人的。他說：「第　沒有一點作爲韻文的價値性，第二趨於散文，第三素朴的演說口調。」他說如和杜甫，拜倫的詩比較就有天淵之感。他們憤慨時世，諷刺政治，用勇敢的精神自他地挑戰。因此他們的詩常給讀者以美妙的抒情底藝術的陶醉。　　萩原這種理解，的確比一般把海湼和拜倫的政治性的詩除外，而單以他們的戀愛的抒情詩爲有藝術價値的批評家進步得多，不過忽視前進詩具有時代的地歌唱最大的熱情而單强調要藝術全上主義似地充滿抒情，善感的藝術的陶醉，却同樣不爲我們敬佩的。正如後藤郁子說：「抒情，善感不是詩感情美的要素的第一義，活生生於人間的素朴的情熱才是詩人本來的姿態。」　　她又說：「爲着驅逐自然主義的形式主義的詩底具體的詩事務，我等着戰鬥的爆發。怎樣的音樂性，怎樣的緊張，怎樣的個性等問題也很想成爲問題的中心」。　　依我看日本詩的經騐，的確有缺乏韻律和散文化的感覺，但我並不同意如某詩論家說那是日本語言的先天的缺陷。日本的普羅詩可說還在萌芽期而且在暴風的摧拆之中，爲着產生偉大的作品，詩人不能不粉身碎骨地幹，同時睛那些看詩的人，不必退坐於幾世前的藝術廢墟上，作非時代性的慨歎。　　詩人的「認識不足」也好，「認識有足」也好，還是拿出我們陣營裏的詩論家的批判底眼晴來觀察吧。　　但是這「認識不足」的餘波，現尙在日本的詩壇蕩漾着。</p>

<p>康健之路  康健醫藥社主編淋病探奇內外兼治　淋疾之病家自療  俄國勞働醫科大學畢業楊道南醫師　　不論男子和女子淋病除須清血抗毒外　還要用特效藥液洗滌患部以除濁排膿　　人類思想不斷進步，文化之發展遂日益猛晋，在醫言醫，今日淋病之治療，日新又新，已可謂進步至最完成之階段。其盡美，固無可比擬；而療法之穩妥，尤無懈可擊！夫淋疾之抗素抗體療法。其特效已為無可否認之事實。又以此療法之應用為內服製劑，故對於患者自療，極為簡便。抗素抗體說者，蓋淋病最有學說根據之權威理論也。　　此種學說，已迭經全歐，如淋病著名學家E.Franke氏及花柳病學博士Dr.Romer等人一再施行動物實騐，均已確認其價値。並證實淋病除蛋白體類脂汁有昂盛人體抗素抗體之特效作用外，別無第二條途徑。而以蛋白體配製黃色素。於是之克淋特效藥「克淋儂」，得以發明成功。查克淋特效式余在俄國莫斯科勞働醫大時，卽已雷聞其名。回國後迭經以「克淋儂」施用於男子腎囊腫大之睾丸炎，遺精夾血之攝護腺炎及一切急慢性淋濁，皆有特具效能。而之婦女隱疾。用「克淋儂」投服。卽能根本剷除血內淋毒肅清淋菌。一方外用「卡而雪地」陰道片每晚於睡前納入體內一二片，卽能將白帶滌凈。恢復生育機能！然淋病雖有「克淋儂」之特效內治法。然欲求格外速效。則之手續亦不可少。此手續以前須行諸淋病醫師，今則前須行諸淋病洗滌　醫師，今則方法進步，可自己如法施行。　　蓄近頃又有最新發明「抗淋水」AntiGonococioAqva，只須依法洗浴尿道或陰道，卽能排除膿濁也。婚後的悲哀　夫婦之道苦矣！  日本帝國醫科大學畢業　陳敏伯醫師　　打開兩性裂痕的障礙——性弱　實現愛情恢復性組織健全　　兩性的結合，並不是完全建設在金錢上，也不是在虛偽的儀式，而是在健全的性慾上。但我們時常看見許多愛虛榮的男女，他們有時為了金錢的誘惑，有時為外表上的面貌所惑，就馬馬虎虎結合了。這種賭命運的婚姻，真不知道送葬了天下多少的青年男女啊！我們應該怎樣去預防呢？既成了事實的男女，又應該如何去補救牠呢？這些問題，我想現代每個青年都應該知道的。　　凡是兩性結合，不論任何一方發覺性機能不健全的話，都宜及早醫治。但是我們時常看見有性病的男子，如青春期的自凟，把青春腺弄壞，性神經斵傷，於是下部矮小，遺精。精虫缺如，攝護腺漏，勃起力不能，白晝見色遺精，此等青年病的男子，縱然免强結婚，也得不到異性的滿足，甚至使異性詬誶，我們兩性的結合，本為嗣育，本為愛情而結合的。現在因了一方有病，使對方在精神和肉體上感到很大的損失。而犧牲可貨的有限青春。所以不論男女，都感到婚後的悲哀。如斯的夫婦之道，可謂苦矣！德國Calolingians，謂青年性腺的被手淫和色慾過度所戕而發生各種症狀。以服「補體康」功效最著。自余日本帝國大學醫科畢業返國應診以來，几遇婚後對於性的不滿足的青年，概給以「補體康」服之，在短期中山血液循流，輸送各部，以袖給青春腺所缺之荷爾蒙。結果病態除去，性組織健全。那麼愛情恢復，度正當甜蜜的兩性的性生活。並恢復了生殖力。但有遺精病的可與「耐而斯遺精片」同服。以固精關而治遺精。療養肺病者之先决條件  陸軍醫科大學畢業宋忠鈺醫師　　冬季為肺病最適於療養之時期……切勿放任此機會　為肺癆患者指示一個正確途徑……謀癆菌完全消滅　　為了肺病的痛苦，我不能絨默，我要本着二十餘年來一點研究心得，給肺病者謀一條自立更新的坦道。如一般所曉得的一樣，結核菌是存在肺臓裏面的，在結核函　周圍，滿生着結締細胞組織。這種組織，就是人體的天然防禦機能，它能够限止結核菌的活動。　　不過，這個防禦組織若不堅固，因了體力的衰减，或肺呼吸的震蕩，常有破裂的危險。而久困病魔的肺癆患者，身體當然非常衰弱。所以肺病的痊愈，也極端困難。　　現在盛行於治療界的肺臓外科手術和理學療法，都無非根據這樣的理由，把肺部壓縮，使結締細胞緊緊圍困結核營造，不致因肺弛張而發生破裂。其奏效實在是很確實的。　　是於肺病的藥物療法呢？　　藥物療法，對於肺病一樣是有着相當功效的。今日的肺病療養院中，對於不施行手術治療的患者，在長期的靜養中，醫師大多設法使其體力增進，以及减除其各種症象。而達到這種目的。都是仰賴於內服藥或注射的，就是受手術（如割肋骨，打空氣）的患者，也沒有不需要藥物治療的。譬如內服鈣劑以及化痰止咳或止血袖體等藥物，足以帮助肺病的迅速治愈者不少，這是從事實上證明的。　　現今肺病最新內服劑，以「補肺拿爾」極為可靠。因此藥包括鈣劑及魚肝油等效力之長處，而無絲毫副作用。故服後咳嗽和吐血，立見停止。且無痰液稀釋，食慾增進。潮熱盜汗，均得霍然！若兼患神經衰弱遺精失眠，可並服男用「補體康」或女用「補女容」，更有偉效。月經紊亂及乳房的萎小  南通醫科大學畢業武鍾麟醫師　　……沒有做腎妻良母的資格的人是女性的恥辱　……經亂腸子萎都是消蝕女子健美和全身的創痛　　女性之所以為女性，和女性之所以為人類中負很大責任的，那就是月經及和及經有連帶關係的乳房了。一個是生殖的重要器官，一個是蕃殖的重要器官。可說是人類的發源地。我們應該很加意的保護牠。但她們因為先天的發育不全，和後天的任意摧毀，性腺機能。失去正常的發育，如卵泡刺　素缺乏，往往引起月經的不調，又因性腺的不發育，以所乳房也不能如健全女子那高聳，患有此等病狀的女性，精神大多深鬱，神經衰弱，多愁心悸，遇事容易遷怒於人，成為性情怪僻之孤獨者，故往往失歡於家庭，見棄於丈夫。　　不用說，這種女子已喪去了賢妻良母的資格。實為女性的一種恥辱。但我們應該如何去挽救她。關係這個問題。我在南通大學醫科畢業後，因用「補女容」一藥，救治經亂乳萎久婚不孕的女子，達數千人。此劑在德國柏林已大為彼邦婦女所矚目而應用，因為牠——「補女容」有旺盛卵巢機能，促青春腺和乳房的發育。所以很快地把上述症狀掃除了。但如患有白帶的可外用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」為坐藥。以滌除白帶。白帶病之危機與自救  陳少華醫師　　白帶是婦女病中極常見之病象，女性因其十女九帶之說，故多漢視，於是變症百出因　道中有種桿菌，能喰外來細菌，但因白帶關係，此種保衛　道健全之桿菌，被其殺滅。於是外來細菌，乘機侵入，破壞腔道之健全組織，且因而侵入子宮，及卵巢致使各部出血，或者因此等細菌之侵入，變為毒質白帶，若偶爾侵染眼內，立時有使失明之危險。又因其毒性甚烈，而為不孕之原因。其療治之方，以外用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」為坐藥，以掃滌白帶，同時增多　桿菌，以殺滅外來之細菌。故不論新起或遠年之白帶，皆可用此片為坐藥。不僅殺菌，且可去炎防腐止泌，其功效之速，逈出常藥之外。惟因淋病而來者，可服「克淋儂」，因月經或體虛而來者可兼服「補女容」，庶可雙方兼顧也。淋毒性後尿道炎腫  姚藥巖醫師　　患者沈浮舫君。年廿三歲。於淋病後繼之以酗酒，故病勢突變，排尿艱窘異常。其泌出之濁液，混有血星，淋絲如絮，浮游尿面，其龜頭與包皮之腫痛雖已退去，然其形狀，依然未復原態。會陰及肛門等處，牽引作痛。曾私服市上某種劣藥，反將毒收入深部，故尿意益感頻數。痛楚尤為劇增。嗣向大東書局購「性病全書」，始來余處治療，經用尿道反射鏡檢查，見其尿道粘胰腫大，幾難辨其皺襞，（如第一圖）其四周亦幾密合無間。小便膨脹，蓋宿尿有所未盡也。余乃用手術排泄其尿液外，一方投以內服「克琳儂」，以殺菌消炎，利尿鎮痛。前後服至三星期，所有粘膜浮腫，已盡行消退，尿亦暢利，更用長短波電氣交互治療至一星期餘。則尿道粘膜之皺襞增多，恢復原狀，（如第二圖）蓋已全愈矣。（第一圖）　　此為未服「克淋儂」前尿道粘膜腫大皺襞幾全消失（第二圖）　　服「克淋儂」後尿道粘膜炎腫消失皺襞增多恢復原狀姚菊巖醫師淋病講座　　（診所）：四用路寗波路轉角　（診時）：上午十時至十午六時。　　惹起性神經衰弱之淋病　　淋毒性性攝護腺炎之最貽留症象，厥為性神經衰弱，蓋攝護腺位於生殖之重要部份，若淋毒性炎症不急事治愈，則腺體因炎症之持續，而釀成各種神經衰弱。此際症象之最易遇見者，為會陰部，腰部有不快之壓迫感。睾丸及上腿內側，有放射不定之輕度疼痛，其疼痛有如穿，如扣，如壓，如刺等狀態。此街不快之痛楚，亦遊移無定，又每於排尿前後，膀胱部有輕度疼痛之感覺，或訴尿後之淋瀝Hantraufeln。除副睾丸部分感到痛楚外，險莖與龜頭，亦有異常之感覺。而最著明之症象，為精液射出之異常。例如頻回之遺精是也。尤其是遺精之後，疲勞無力之感覺為甚。其他為勃起不能，精液漏由攝護腺炎而成攝護腺漏。至此性神經已大為衰弱。患者每為不安與恐怖所襲。而不孕亦為本病症象之一。　　處理此症，不僅單在袪除淋毒，更宜挽治性器官與神經衰弱並重。有住賈西義路之高乃昌君，由慢性攝護腺炎，後又起遺精，睾丸炎痛等症，精神頹喪，大小便後，恒繼之以米泔色之白液物流出。經余診斷結果，認為神經性攝護腺炎。乃施行電療法，一方投服德國「克淋儂」以增多抗淋素，使　菌作用，直接在病灶發生。五星期後，卽大著成效。會陰與腰部及睾丸之痛楚皆已根除，足見「克淋儂」對此症已臻尅服地步。惟性神經之衰弱尙未告痊。亦囑購服「補體康」以强壯性腺而治其神經衰弱，至四星期後，遺精，勃起力不能等，又完全治愈矣。嗣因其夫人亦患淋毒陰道炎。用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」為坐藥。仍以「克淋儂」為內服劑。而愈。今春幸舉一子。蓋性機能已全恢復矣。健碩的體力　為男性所必具  留俄楊道南醫師　　新時代的婦女所昕夕禱求的丈夫：　要像綿羊的溫馴和有蠻牛的氣力！　青年期犯了手淫而致遺精將怎樣？　　時代的輪子，已輾碎了舊式白面書生的男性美。那為往昔所厭惡的小黑炭以及組碩的男性體格，已一躍而成婦女們理想中所渴求的對象了。　　不管是性格要怎樣的溫馴，甚至由男性而變成如女性般的溫柔；但像蠻件一樣的體格，實在是新時代男子所必具的條件。必須神氣虎虎，孔武有力，才能够站在時代的尖端，為妻子和異性所愛護。　　我們如果看那些鬧離婚或是失戀悲劇的人，實際都是為了自己卑怯無能，失去駕馭異性的力量。　　這種不滿于異性的男子，都是體力方面有了缺陷。或雖肥碩逾恒，却是虛有其表。他們大都是在青年期犯了手淫，斵喪性器，濫費了荷爾蒙精液，或由房事過多，消蝕健碩的體力，以致性器短小，陰萎早洩，遺精夢多，甚至失眠腰痛，腎虛腦弱。所以在根本治療上，應該旺盛全身荷爾蒙，便全身和腎部體力增强，細胞發育昂盛，這就得服用荷爾蒙製劑「補體康」以達到此種目的，此外是沒有其他方法的。至於遺精那就須同時進服「耐而斯遺精片」了。讀者園地　　下列各業，均經國內外醫科大學畢業醫師指定。購時務請認明各藥各稱！切勿妄信他人言而購雜牌劣藥，以免服後引起危險。　　戒煙要藥　　編輯先生：余染煙癖，已歷多年，屢戒重犯，皆因戒煙期內，未有適當製劑。致痛苦重重，遺精早洩，腎虧失眠。今限期已迫，乞示可靠藥劑。（岳雲龍）　　答：煙毒已將全身荷爾蒙毀滅，必須以荷爾蒙劑「補體康」量盛荷爾蒙，則可免痛苦，而能將血內煙毒，根本肅清　　胃弱便秘　　蕪湖何健人君來函云：鄙人久患胃病，食少胸悶，噯氣頻仍，常作噁心。又大便時覺乾硬，不易排出。且食後作脹，腹中隱痛，經友人蕭君之介紹，購服「强胃精」三瓶，竟獲偉效，胃口頓開，所患各症。均憶完全沙失云。用特介紹同症焉。　　遺精頻繁　　長沙張和敏君問：患了沉重的遺精，現覺眠花面熱，記憶减退，體力衰弱。擬服「耐而斯遺精片」及「補體康」，請問何處有售？卽請示知！　　答：上海各大藥房均售，函購可滙欵至上海寗波路五號海彌登總行。　　歡迎問病！請函示尊址並附回郵，寄上海武定呼八六九號。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言綏軍事不影響南京談判？  我　　昨據本報電訊，綏北接觸，記者特為此事，往訪日大使館發言人松村書記官，詢以萬一該方面發生戰事，南京外，談判，是否中止，松村答謂，近日察綏軍事，乃中國正式軍隊與土匪間事，完全為中國內政，與日本無關云云，把察綏的軍事，推得一乾二淨，認為中國內政問題，這句語恐不見得有人相信吧？此次中日交涉，原欲作整個的談判，察綏問題，天然也是交涉中之一，安能把察綏的軍事，完全推在土匪身上。　　幷且所謂交涉者，並不是僅靠口頭上的空談，當以事實為根據。故交涉與事實原有連帶與密切關係，若事實儘管事實，交涉儘管交涉，則所謂交涉者是交涉些甚麼？現在察綏的事，他們已經是認定土匪的行動，但是我們對於這稱土匪，應該羣策羣力，同心一致，先來解决一下，不使他們蔓延開來。　　又據電訊，北平清華學生開天會，議决停止煤火五日，計可得千餘元，捐贈綏東國軍，表示慰勞，又息，平地泉防禦工事堅固，槍械齊備，惟麵粉問題，無法解决云云，這個問題，非同小可，這種衛國衛民的士兵，我們當設法相當的接濟，不能看察綏遠在關外，我們以秦人視之，萬一察綏盡為土匪世界，一步一步的進來，到那時再要想挽救，恐也來不反了，總之我們的一尺土，一寸地，一個人民，都是我中華民國的土地，都是我們的同胞，不能看他一個一個下水去，一個一個的滅亡。　　現在欲挽救的方怯，亦極簡單，祗要像清華的大學生的節衣縮食，源源不絕地去供給前方的兵士，我們未曾直接蒙著土匪的擾亂時，先應該少請一次客，少吃一頓點心，少看一次電影，少看一塲戲少吃一匣白錫包，少穿一件新衣裳，少跳一夜舞，少打一塲麻雀，少聽一回書，少吃一斤老酒，少開一間房間，少吃一檯花酒，少買一些，要物，少買一些古董，少買一些。消費而無用之物，若有喜慶喪吊的事，少擺一些，排塲，節省一些，糜費，去供給我們衛國衛民的兵士，這才是我中華民國人民的責任，也是我中華民國人民應盡的責任。　　現在我們的國民，應當枕戈待旦，節衣縮食，以救國家，現在並不是驕奢浮樂的時候，也並不是安富尊榮的時侯，我們當抬起頭來看看，側着頭去想想</p>

<h3>Observing Bandit and Puppet Troops: Attacking from Northeast of Suiyuan, Fierce Fighting Yesterday Afternoon, Gunfire Heard Near Shangdu, Aircraft from a Certain Side Assisting in Reconnaissance, Fu Zuoyi Inspects Jining Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Guihua) The mixed troops of puppet bandits, etc., in Shangdu, under the command of Li Shouxin, have been attacking from the northeast of Suiyuan since the 11th. From 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM, the fighting was very fierce. Rapid and dense gunfire was heard near Shangdu. At the same time, aircraft from a certain side assisted in the battle, which did not stop until the morning of the 12th. At 6:30 AM on the 12th, seven aircraft flew west over Shangdu from the east to conduct reconnaissance over the battlefield, but did not drop bombs. At around 8:00 AM, they returned to the Shangdu airfield. Furthermore, leaders from a certain side and the puppet bandit troops, etc., held important consultations at Jiaxiasi on the 11th and 12th. Also, on the 11th, sixty vehicles of military supplies were transported from Duolun and Zhangbei to Shangdu, and thirty vehicles were immediately distributed to Bailingmiao. More than 700 soldiers from a certain army continued to arrive at the temple. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) Fu Zuoyi went to Jining for inspection on the night of the 12th and is expected to return to Suiyuan on the 13th. The east of Suiyuan is currently very peaceful. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Although the bandit puppet troops under Li Shouxin and Wang Ying have launched attacks on various places in eastern and northern Suiyuan, they have not succeeded due to our solid defenses and have suffered heavy losses repeatedly. Some days ago, the bandit puppet armies once concentrated at Bailingmiao to attack northern Suiyuan. However, due to the inconvenient transportation in that area and the extreme difficulty in military transport, and the severe shortage of food and supplies, the bandit puppet armies' plan to attack northern Suiyuan has again failed. There are no problems with the Ping-Sui transportation and the safety within Suiyuan. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The original division troops of the Fifth Army of the Puppet Manchukuo are transporting supplies from Chifeng and Duolun to the Suiyuan border. The main focus of the puppet army is on the Xinghe defense line. First, the puppet Li Shouxin and Bao Yueqing divisions are stationed and active in front of our defense line, adopting disruptive tactics to demoralize our troops, and then launch a full-scale attack. It is heard that soldiers from a certain country have disguised themselves as Puppet Manchukuo troops and are gathering at Jiabusi, waiting for an opportunity. The general attack is scheduled for around the 20th. Brigade Commander Zeng Yanyi, acting on behalf of Fu Zuoyi to meet Song Bi, has already returned to his defense post. (12th Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The bandit army of Chahar and Suiyuan uses Shangdu as its base and Daqinggou as its front line. Several hundred military officers from a certain country have been dispatched by a certain military headquarters outside the customs to serve as supervisors in Zhangbei and Duolun. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing: Fellow villagers from Suiyuan in Nanjing, concerned about the tense and precarious situation in eastern Suiyuan due to the bandit puppet troops receiving support from a certain side and invading, held a meeting at 3:00 PM on the 12th. More than ten people attended, including Central Committee member Zhao Yunyi and student representatives, to discuss three measures for assistance and comfort to the soldiers of Suiyuan: (1) Urge the National Government's Military Affairs Commission and the Executive Yuan to provide substantial assistance to the soldiers of Suiyuan and work hard to resist the enemy. (2) Recommend Zhao Yunyi and others to visit the party, government, and military authorities to report the actual situation in Suiyuan. (3) Donate funds based on the monthly salaries of fellow villagers in Nanjing to comfort the soldiers, with those earning over 500 yuan per month donating 200 yuan, and those earning the lowest monthly salary of 20 yuan donating 4 yuan. Students will reduce their food consumption for one week to donate funds. (12th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Magistrate of Dongsheng County, Cheng Rui, Assassinated and Killed</h3>
<p>(Guihua) Lu Chengrui, the magistrate of Dongsheng County, was suddenly assassinated and killed on the morning of the 12th. The provincial government has sent personnel to investigate. The order within Dongsheng City is peaceful, maintained by Liu Ziying, the director of the security office, to preserve the status quo. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Lianchi College Moves Its Collection</h3>
<p>(Baoding) On the 12th, Lianchi College began to move 2,862 types of Song Dynasty block-printed classics, historical works, philosophical works, and literary collections stored in the former Lianchi Academy to the Scripture Depository for management and display by the College. It is said that Song Zheyuan will come to Baoding to visit soon. (12th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Sun Weidong Goes to Beiping</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Sun Weidong, the Tianjin Customs Superintendent, went to Beiping on the morning of the 12th to meet with Song and took the night train south to Nanjing to report to central leaders on behalf of Song. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The U.S. Embassy Discusses the Issue of U.S. Nationals Withdrawing from Three Provinces: A Total of Thirty-Four U.S. Nationals; British and French Authorities Have Not Yet Taken Action</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The U.S. Embassy in China is currently consulting with the relevant U.S. consulates in various locations to discuss the Chinese government's request for foreign nationals to withdraw from the three provinces of Suiyuan, Ningxia, and Qinghai. It is reported that there are a total of thirty-four U.S. nationals in the aforementioned three provinces, including thirteen adults and six children in Suiyuan, four adults in Ningxia, and six adults and five children in Qinghai. The British Embassy here has not yet received any documents from the Chinese side. Although the exact number of British nationals residing in the above three provinces is unknown, it can be determined that it is very small. The French authorities in Beiping have not yet taken action, as this matter is being handled by the French Ambassador currently in Shanghai. It is generally believed that there must be many French Catholic priests in the above three provinces, as well as some priests from Germany and Belgium. It is noted that Japan currently has military inspection groups stationed in Zhangjiakou, Guihua, Baotou, Ningxia, and Yixingeer, and has established radio stations in Baotou, Ningxia, and Yixingeer. Song Zheyuan, Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, expressed his opinion when meeting with reporters that the situation in Suiyuan is unlikely to develop into a serious conflict in the near future. (12th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Various embassies here have received notifications from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that foreigners are prohibited from traveling in the bandit suppression areas of Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai provinces in the future. The British, American, and French embassies are consulting on the withdrawal and protection measures for residents in these provinces. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Eight U.S. Warships Left Hong Kong Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Eight U.S. warships left Hong Kong for Singapore on the morning of the 12th. (12th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Ambassador Xu Reports on the Meeting with Foreign Minister Arita: The Japanese Side Still Does Not Have a Thorough Understanding of Our Position</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Sino-Japanese diplomacy is on holiday today, and there has been no contact between the two sides. Ambassador Kawagoe's eighth visit to Foreign Minister Zhang is scheduled for this week, but the timing is still being discussed and decided. Ambassador Xu has reported to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the morning of the 12th after meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita to clarify our position. The content is not much different from what was reported in the press. It is heard that the Japanese side's understanding of our position has not yet reached a thorough and clear level. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Today's Asahi Shimbun editorial, titled "The Background of Sino-Japanese Negotiations," begins by expressing strong dissatisfaction with the Japanese government's secrecy regarding the recent Nanjing negotiations. It then states that the Chinese government's unexpectedly tough stance on the two major issues of joint anti-communism and North China has brought the talks to a standstill. What Japan needs to reflect on is comparing the public opinions of the two countries. On the Chinese side, the whole country is united under the major principles of anti-Japanese resistance and national salvation, advancing towards a very clear goal. However, on the Japanese side, although internal and external situations may have been considered, there has been no indication of what our purpose is, causing the public to lack enthusiasm and easily fall into indifference. Therefore, the background of public opinion in the two countries, the strengths of the host and guest, are very clear. The newspaper concludes that the most regrettable thing is that the initial calls were too high, while the outcome seems insufficient to cope with the situation. If Japan only seeks a formal end to the current negotiations, it will cause China to despise Japan even more. Therefore, it is better to suspend the overall negotiations and immediately revert to the original state before the negotiations, leaving the matter to be dealt with in the future. In a nutshell, we have learned a lesson from the current negotiations: if we still ignore the psychology of the Chinese people when adjusting Sino-Japanese relations, progress is impossible. Furthermore, the Sino-Foreign Business News editorial, titled "Sino-Japanese Negotiations and the Anti-Communist Issue," briefly states that the North China issue can be temporarily set aside, but China's continued skepticism about the anti-communist issue is incomprehensible.

<p>(Tokyo) The content of the seventh meeting between Kawagoe and Zhang Qun on the 10th was reported in detail to the Japanese Foreign Ministry via official telegram by Ambassador Kawagoe on the evening of the 11th. It is heard that the Chinese side's attitude at the meeting on that day was quite tough, so the future of Sino-Japanese negotiations still shows a difficult situation, making it impossible to develop the negotiations. To stop the meeting, Kawagoe and Zhang Qun plan to temporarily avoid continuing the meeting. In the future, Consul General Suma and Gao Zongwu will conduct side-line preliminary negotiations, and the Kawagoe-Zhang Qun meeting will be resumed when there is a possibility of a formal meeting.

<h3>Song Zheyuan Makes a Statement: The Issue of Eastern Suiyuan Is a Minor Matter, Abolishing Arbitrary Flights by Japanese Aircraft</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan said when meeting with reporters on the morning of the 12th that he went to Tianjin to handle private matters. Commander Tadashi visited him in Tianjin, and he also returned the visit. Apart from social courtesies, there was nothing else discussed. Recently, the diplomacy in North China, such as Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, has continued previous unfinished negotiations based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit. The content is exactly the same as reported in the press. Sino-Japanese air traffic is generally prepared, and there are still some revisions to the regulations. It will soon be realized. At the same time, the arbitrary flights of Japanese military aircraft in our airspace will also be abolished. Sino-Japanese aircraft plan to draw a Bagua diagram for identification. Reports about the tense situation in eastern Suiyuan are mostly exaggerated. The number of Mongolian puppet troops is not less than 10,000, and the reports of 40,000 to 50,000 are inaccurate. Because the weather is severely cold in places like Bailingmiao and Jiaxiasi, and fuel and food are scarce, it is factually impossible to station such a large number of people. Therefore, in Song's observation, the issue of eastern Suiyuan is still a minor matter. He had long planned to go to Chahar for inspection, but was unable to spare time due to busy official duties. If time permits, he may go. Hebei Province's administrative affairs are important, and he has no time to take care of them concurrently, so he is succeeded by Division Commander Feng Zhi'an to specialize in the responsibility.

<h3>Central and National Government Jointly Hold Commemoration Ceremony for Sun Yat-sen's Birthday: National Government Chairman Lin Leads the Ceremony and Reports, Various Places Hold Commemorations, All Agencies Take a Holiday</h3>

At 8:00 AM, the music was played, and the ceremony was held, chaired by National Government Chairman Lin, who led everyone in paying their respects and then gave a speech. After the speech, he led all the Central Committee members, National Government Committee members, and specially appointed officials into the mausoleum to pay respects to the remains, then returned to their positions. Then, the music was played and the ceremony was completed. All the participants then went down the mountain. The main points of Chairman Lin's report were: "On this day, forty-six years before the founding of the Republic of China, our National Father was born, which is the most commemorative day. The birthplace of the National Father, Cuiheng Village, has beautiful scenery and early intellectual development. The National Father developed the aspiration to save the country and the people and the mindset to do great things in this environment from an early age. This is something we can never forget. The National Father was the creator of the Republic of China and was appointed as the President, but in order to promote unification, he did not hesitate to give up his honor and resigned as President. This great spirit is something only Washington has in the world and is the most glorious record in the history of revolution. Our National Father was extremely great, and I don't need to go into detail, but I can say that the basic conditions for the National Father to achieve great personality, in addition to the childhood environment and family education, were that he had (1) a love of learning, (2) practice, and (3) love of people, three personalities that are unmatched by ordinary people. Because of his love of learning, he never put down his books, studied various theories, and invented the Three Principles of the People, the Founding Strategy, and the Founding Outline. Because of his practice, he embraced a spirit of fearlessness and did not lose heart after ten major failures, and finally the Republic of China was born. Because of his love of people, he had the heart of the Buddha, treating people with forgiveness and relying on the people to be moved by the world, leaving behind the legacy of fraternal love and sincerity. In short, the National Father's entire personality has an ethical foundation of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, righteousness, peace, and his life's work was revolution. The purpose of the revolution was to save China, and his personal cultivation was to be able to love learning, practice, and love people. Today, we should urgently emulate the National Father's cultivation and continue the National Father's spirit to complete the National Father's will, so as not to betray this warm commemoration."

<h3>Revolutionary Pioneer, You Lie, Passes Away</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Revolutionary pioneer You Lie had long suffered from asthma. Unexpectedly, his condition suddenly worsened on the afternoon of the twelfth. Despite medical treatment, he passed away at his residence at 7:35 PM on the twelfth. According to legislator Feng Ziyou, who rushed from Shanghai on the twelfth to see him, when he saw Mr. You in the morning, his condition was not severe, and he was chatting and laughing as usual. However, at 1:00 PM, his breathing suddenly became rapid, and phlegm accumulated in his throat. Despite the careful diagnosis and treatment by his old friend, Western doctor Cheng Liqing, there was no improvement. At around 5:00 PM, traditional Chinese medicine practitioner Ye Guhong was called in, and ginseng soup was administered, but to no avail. He passed away at 7:35 PM. His aides have already reported the death to the Central Party Headquarters and have scheduled the encoffining at the Renxiao Funeral Home on the morning of the thirteenth. (Twelfth day, Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) You Lie passed away at 7:35 PM on the afternoon of the twelfth.

The body was moved to the Renxiao Funeral Home around midnight and is scheduled to be encoffined today. After arriving in Nanjing, You had already prepared his will, which will be formally announced within days. (Twelfth day, Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) You Lie's brief biography is as follows: Mr. You, whose courtesy name is Shaowan and also Lingji, was from Shunde, Guangdong. He advocated revolution at a young age and was known as one of the "Four Bandits" along with Premier Sun, Yang Heling, and Chen Shaobai, as the initial founders of the Revive China Society. Later, the Revive China Society was reorganized into the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance), and he presided over the alliance in the Nanyang region. Countless overseas Chinese were inspired by him to join the revolution. The name "Republic of China" was determined by Premier Sun and Mr. You in Japan. When the Wuchang Uprising occurred, he rushed to Yunnan to urge the Southwest to revolt, which the entire nation followed. After the founding of the Republic of China, Yuan Shikai attempted to appease him with titles and emoluments, but Mr. You was unmoved. Instead, he formed the Salvation Army and denounced Yuan's crimes. After Yuan's downfall, Mr. You lived in seclusion in Hong Kong. In the tenth year of the Republic (1921), when Premier Sun established a government in Guangzhou, he repeatedly sent envoys to invite him to serve, but he firmly declined. This year, due to the peaceful unification of the country, he came to Nanjing to pay respects at the mausoleum and take a short rest, but his old illness recurred and he passed away on the afternoon of the twelfth at the age of seventy-two.

<h3>American Insulting Film to be Shipped to Nanjing for Inspection</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the case of the American Paramount film insulting China, the company's representative in Nanjing explained that before producing "The General Died at Dawn," they believed that Du Tingxiu, the Chinese representative in the US during the filming of "The Good Earth," had indeed instructed the Chinese government representative to hire Mr. Du for close guidance to ensure caution. They filmed the movie according to Mr. Du's opinions, and the company has Mr. Du's written proof. Before, when the film was screened in Manila, it had been reviewed and approved by the local Chinese Chamber of Commerce.

<h3>Porcelain of Zhejiang</h3>
<p>— Chen Wanli</p>
<p>Regarding the recorded porcelain production in Zhejiang, it was called "Biao" in the Jin Dynasty, "Yue," "Mise," and "Wuzhou" in the Tang Dynasty, and "Ge," "Longquan," "Xiuneisi Guan Kiln," "Jiaotai Xia Xin Kiln," and various so-called "Quanshan Kiln" names in the Song Dynasty.</p>
<p>Historically speaking, Longquan porcelain has been the most prestigious. However, from the scholar-officials who appreciated and collected it to the antique dealers who resold it, they only knew the two characters "Longquan." Furthermore, when talking about Longquan, there was nothing else to say besides the three characters "Mei Yuqing." Such narrow-mindedness and limited vision truly represent the attitude of someone born in a closed-off era.</p>
<p>In recent years, due to the discovery of the Jiaotai Xia Xin Kiln and the inadequacy of the name "Longquan" to encompass the products from various locations, large kilns have been discovered in Dayao, Zhukou, Fengtang, and Xinting. (See my book "A Study of Celadon"). Due to the sensation caused by the discovery of shattered pieces near Shanglin Lake in Yuyao in the Hangzhou market, the general public has finally awakened and realized that there are so many kiln sites and so many precious ancient artifacts in Zhejiang. This has broken the erroneous view of representing Zhejiang's ancient porcelain with just Longquan kiln, which is indeed a great step forward in understanding Zhejiang porcelain.</p>
<p>In fact, it's not just this. With the promotion of Yue ware from Shanglin Lake in Yuyao by the Qian family during the Five Dynasties, for the purpose of frequent offerings, a large amount of production was carried out (see my book "A Historical Study of Yue Ware"). This relationship allowed the production of Yue ware to achieve unprecedented and pioneering work in the history of Chinese porcelain (see my book "Preface to Yue Ware Illustrations"). Before this, in terms of technique, there was nothing as exquisite and mature as it, and in terms of patterns, there was nothing as complex as it. Therefore, Yue ware has a brilliant page in the history of Chinese porcelain, and it can also be said that Zhejiang's porcelain production occupies an extremely glorious position in the history of Chinese porcelain.</p>
<p>Later, Longquan rose up, and from the early production to the Ming Dynasty, it not only fully supplied the needs of the people, but also, due to exports, the reputation of Zhejiang Longquan porcelain spread far abroad. Recently, due to the discovery of kiln sites in various parts of Longquan, we know the astonishing amount of production at that time and the progress of porcelain-making techniques. In addition, under the situation of the Southern Song Dynasty's partial peace, the most exquisite and precious works of the Jiaotai Guan Kiln were produced, which truly opened a new era for the production of Guan Kilns in the South in the history of Chinese porcelain.</p>
<p>Because of Yue ware, Longquan, and the Southern Song Guan Kiln, Zhejiang's porcelain production can be said to have reached a golden age. The so-called Xing, Ding, Jun, Ru, and Ci kilns in the North are certainly very famous, but whether the North surpasses the South or the South surpasses the North is really not easy to distinguish. Taking the Xing ware of the North as an example, although the base of Xing porcelain has not yet been discovered, so that the true appearance of Xing porcelain can be seen, it was already said at the time that Xing was not as good as Yue. The Ding ware has extremely complex patterns, which can be compared with the Yue ware of the Five Dynasties. The Southern Song Xiuneisi Guan Kiln, led by Shao Chengzhang (whose kiln base has not yet been discovered) and the Jiaotai Xin Kiln, are said to have followed the legacy of the old capital and should not be much different from the production of Bianliang. In short, in these hundreds of years, the North and South have indeed gone their separate ways, each showing their skills. The North was centered on Hebei and Henan, while the South was exclusively in Zhejiang. Other kilns in other provinces can only be regarded as vassals of Zhejiang. Therefore, Zhejiang's porcelain production not only has a glorious place in the history of Chinese porcelain, but I can boldly assert that Zhejiang's porcelain production, along with the North's porcelain production, equally occupies this period of history. Therefore, if we don't talk about historical facts, then so be it, but if we do, Zhejiang's porcelain production is extremely important in the historical aspect.</p>
<p>From then on, the old saying that we have always known, the so-called Chai, Ru, Guan, Ge, and Ding five major kilns, has been fundamentally broken. And from this saying of the five major kilns, Zhejiang's porcelain production, which has always been obliterated, also has a day to turn over.</p>
<p>However, recent facts also tell us that Zhejiang's porcelain production has not only won this historical status and glory, but new discoveries in the future are increasing day by day. For example, the discovery of the kiln base under the Jiuyan Kiln Temple in Shaoxing; because of the development of the ancient mine in Xiangli, Lizhu, the real objects of Huanglong Taikang Yuankang bricks and Yuanhe tomb bricks, etc., proved the age of Jiuyan Kiln Yuyao Yue ware; I also found several kiln bases in Huzhou, Jinhua, etc., which are all extremely important things. I don't know how many miracles will be discovered in the past history of Zhejiang porcelain!</p>
<p>Therefore, to sum up, after the continuous discoveries in recent years, Zhejiang's porcelain production has, on the one hand, confirmed its importance in the history of porcelain, and at the same time, because of many new kiln bases and new evidence, it is continuously discovered in a rising trend, as if it is an unexploited mine, containing many rich resources, waiting for our efforts. I very much hope that comrades who aim at research will not easily let go of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The American New Monroe Doctrine and China</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Since Roosevelt was re-elected as president of the United States by domestic and foreign voters in the current American election, many political commentators at home and abroad have made brilliant speculations, saying that Roosevelt will show some "color" to the world on the Far East issue in his second term. We are happy to hear that some "color" will be shown to the world, but let's not be complacent. From 1932 to the present, Roosevelt has been the head of the United States for nearly four years. The actual benefits the United States has given us are nothing more than a few empty declarations. Some people may say that the United States was hindered by unprecedented economic depression in the past four years and was busy with domestic affairs and had no time to take care of other things. Now that the American economy has improved and Roosevelt has been re-elected by his voters, his "position in leading world peace will be more powerful than that of President Wilson of the previous Democratic Party." Just seeing his peace speech in mid-August accusing the imperialists who violated the treaty, and just seeing the statement by US Secretary of State Hull in late September that he would continue to maintain Stimson's non-recognition of China, we can know that his foreign policy toward the Far East may have more positive expression. In addition, Roosevelt is preparing to personally attend the Pan-American Conference held in Buenos Aires, the capital of Argentina, in December after being re-elected. This also shows Roosevelt's enthusiasm for advocating peace. The main tasks of the Pan-American Conference are to conclude a neutrality convention, maintain peace in the Americas, establish a commercial committee, and allow neutral countries to freely restrict and prohibit trade with belligerent countries. According to some people's analysis, the main purpose is two: one is naturally to prevent the Western Hemisphere from being involved in the impending war in Europe, and the other is to establish a joint economic front to sanction aggressive countries in the East, because Japanese commerce definitely cannot rely on China alone to make its goods no longer surplus. It needs the markets of the Americas. It needs the markets of the British Dominions and colonies. As a result of the Anglo-Japanese economic conflict, the British territories have already implemented the exclusion of Japanese goods, giving Japan a serious blow. If the Americas have a joint boycott, causing it to suffer a greater blow, this may not be a sanction for Japan.</p>
<p>Such observations are of course reasonable, but we must not forget that the so-called Good Neighbor Policy of the United States toward South America is, in essence, not based on the view of peace, but a new posture of the Monroe Doctrine. The United States wants to monopolize the markets of South America and exclude the economic forces of all other countries, especially Britain, from the Americas. In other words, the United States has lost the Far Eastern markets and seeks compensation in South America. In this way, a more serious conflict of economic interests between Britain and the United States will inevitably arise. The reason why Britain and the United States cannot cooperate in the Far East is not limited to one reason. However, we cannot but admit that this new Monroe doctrine of the United States is one of the main reasons. Two days ago, news came from Tokyo saying that the conflict of power between Japan and the United States in the Pacific is not as harmful as the conflict between Britain and Japan, and although the conflict of power between Britain and the United States in the Pacific is slight, the conflict in the Americas is more intense. We cannot say that this observation is entirely one-sided propaganda, and there is some truth in it.</p>
<p>Since Anglo-American cooperation is still the same as in the past, Roosevelt's future diplomacy will of course mostly be limited to his past legacy without any essential change. From our standpoint, hoping to rely on American diplomatic assistance to restore our lost rights and interests is really tantamount to wishful thinking. But speaking of this, I must declare that I am not saying that diplomacy is useless. What I mean is that under the circumstances of daily diminishing territory, it is absolutely impossible to rely solely on others to come out and maintain so-called justice to preserve our sovereignty and territory without seeking active solutions ourselves. If we make up our minds, the world's attention will be turned upside down, and the bloodshed people will treat us with respect. However, it depends on what our determination is today.</p>
<h3>Japan Streamlines Naval Lineup: Major Personnel Implement Major Shifts; Hase Appointed Commander of the Third Fleet</h3>
<p>Nanjing: This naval change can be said to be the first major change since Navy Minister Nagano took office. Therefore, it is relatively difficult to be as mediocre as ever. It actually reflects the current situation. Vice Admiral Minei, who bears the important mission of Commander of the Combined Fleet, is a pure military officer who does not interfere in politics. Vice Admiral Yoshida, Commander of the Second Fleet, has been nominated as a reserve admiral and is a person with a clear mind and rich judgment. Vice Admiral Hasegawa, Commander of the Third Fleet, was an admiral during the terms of both Osumi and Nagano, and has the credit of being trusted by the people for being able to deal with difficult domestic and foreign situations. He has a clear mind and is rich in political negotiation skills, so he is the most suitable person to take on the position of Commander of the Third Fleet to open up the difficult situation between China and Japan. New Admiral Yamamoto Isoroku, Vice Admiral, became famous during the London Naval Preparatory Conference and is a person who boldly advances toward what he believes in. Vice Admiral Hyakutake, Commander of the Yokosuka Naval District, has served as Commander of the Third Fleet and Chief of the Navy Technical Department. Vice Admiral Kato, Commander of the Kure Naval District, is the adopted son of Admiral Kato Tomosaburo. Because of his noble self-discipline, he is highly trusted by his subordinates. Vice Admiral Shiozawa, Commander of the Sasebo Naval District, and Vice Admiral Yoshida Yamamoto are classmates. Vice Admiral Nakamura, Commander of the Maizuru Naval Port, is a Tosa person from the same hometown as Navy Minister Nagano. The main thing is to value the air force. Therefore, the new Chief of the Aviation Headquarters, Oikawa, the Commander of the Third Fleet, Hasegawa, and the new Admiral Yamamoto, the Commander of the Combined Fleet Minei, etc., are all great figures who should be given special attention. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Navy's regular promotion and major changes for Showa 11 (1936) were presented to the Emperor by Navy Minister Nagano on the 7th and approved.

<h3>Japanese Ministry of Finance: Cuts Budgets of All Sectors</h3>

The Ministry of Finance ordered the Budget Bureau to review the budgets of various ministries and has obtained a review plan, which has been presented to the officials concerned in each ministry to avoid disputes in the budget cabinet meeting and the budget meeting. The Ministry of Finance plans to reduce the new budget request of 1.6 billion to 1.1 billion yuan, reducing the total budget to below 3 billion yuan. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>Oral Statement by British Military Expert: Strength of the Russian Army: Fully Mechanized; Common Hatred Against Germany</h3>
<p>(London) A British military expert recently went to Soviet Russia to investigate its army combat strength in detail. After returning home, he stated the following content today: The experts saw hundreds of tanks performing difficult movements, and their power was enough to impress people deeply. They can almost be said to be indestructible. A two-ton tank fell into a deep ditch, and then lifted seven feet high and stopped safely on the flat ground. In the opinion of the experts, the Soviet Union's aircraft are still below the highest standards of other countries, but the agility of its pilots seems unmatched. Judging from the situation in the large exercises, the Soviet Union's officers seem to be the weakest part of the military. They can only act according to the predetermined plan and lack the spontaneity and resourcefulness to deal with emergencies. However, there are several officers from the imperial era in the Army General Staff who seem extremely capable. Train transportation is still insufficient, and mobilization seems to be slow. However, the army is fully equipped with trucks. The experts visited a factory where they were assembled and manufactured, which can produce 300 trucks every day. The Soviet troops have good clothing and supplies, so they look very strong. They have a high degree of animosity towards Germany, because their superiors often warn them about this.

<h3>British King Reviews Navy: Portland Harbor: Violent Winds</h3>
<p>(London) The British fleet gathered in Portland Harbor to await the British King's review. Today, there are violent winds outside the harbor. This morning, the train carrying the British King arrived at Portland Station. The wind speed reached 80 miles per hour. Huge waves crashed against the shore, sometimes reaching the tracks. The British King, dressed in the uniform of a Navy Admiral, got off the train and took a car to the dock, where he was greeted by the Commander-in-Chief of the Home Fleet. Before the British King boarded the ship, four sailors rowed a small boat across the harbor and were blown by the wind against the seawall. The four sailors quickly climbed onto the seawall, and the boat sank immediately. A lifeboat was then sent to rescue them. After the Emperor boarded the ship, the flagship raised its flag and fired a salute. From the Admiralty to the sailors of the newly entered fleet, they are now hoping that the wind will subside and the waves will calm down so that the Emperor can carry out his review procedures. There are a total of thirty or forty warships gathered in the harbor. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>Franco-Russian Pact: French Right-Wing Leader Also Expresses Support</h3>
<p>(Paris) Right-wing leader and Member of Parliament Mandel gave a speech today unconditionally endorsing the mutual assistance pact concluded between France and the Soviet Union, which has attracted general attention. Mandel served as the confidential secretary of the famous Tiger Prime Minister Clemenceau during the European War. Later, he served twice as Minister of Posts and Telecommunications in the Florentin Cabinet and the Sarraut Cabinet. He is currently a Member of Parliament. Today, on the occasion of the Armistice Day of the European War, Mandel gave a speech in his constituency, saying, "In the past fifteen years, Germany has repeatedly violated the Treaty of Versailles, and even risked the wrong to reorganize its armaments. This is all due to the weakness and incompetence of the League of Nations. For this reason, former Prime Minister Laval signed the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact with the Soviet government on May 3, 1935. Foreign comments say that the motivation for the Franco-Soviet Pact is more due to ideology and less due to security expectations. This kind of public opinion can be said to be groundless. Furthermore, French nationalists spread an opinion that the Soviet Union is determined to cause a world war. This statement is not accurate. It should be known that Germany is currently concentrating all its military power to oppose France. Germany is currently building military roads in areas close to the French border. In addition, a large number of troops are stationed in the Rhineland region, which must be paid attention to," he said. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>End of Conference between Italy and Austria; Austria Recognizes Italy's Annexation of Abyssinia; Italian Foreign Minister Departs Vienna</h3>
<p>(Vienna) The Foreign Ministers' conference of Italy, Austria, and Hungary, which opened yesterday, concluded this afternoon. A communique will be issued to explain the achievements of the conference. This noon, members of the three delegations and the German Ambassador to Austria, Papen, attended a banquet hosted by the Hungarian Ambassador to Austria, Truttena. In the evening, the Austrian Foreign Minister Schmidt will host a reception and attend a performance at the theater. The Hungarian Foreign Minister Kanya is scheduled to leave tonight for his home country. The Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano is scheduled to depart from here for the Hungarian capital tomorrow. (Havas Dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) It was announced at the Three-Country Conference that Hungary and Austria have officially recognized Italy's conquest of Abyssinia. Tonight, Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg hosted a banquet at the Shangbailun Palace, where he raised a toast to King Victor Emmanuel, addressing him as "King of Italy and Emperor of Abyssinia." The British, French, and American ambassadors were also present and felt quite uneasy, but managed to avoid drinking the toast. Observers say that the two countries' recognition of Italy's conquest of Abyssinia is noteworthy because Italian Prime Minister Mussolini recently stated in a speech in Milan that if Hungary cannot reclaim the territories it lost after the European war, there will be no peace in the Danube region. Now that recognition has been granted, Italy may first grant Hungary and Austria commercial privileges in Abyssinia as a reward. Furthermore, the outcome of the Three-Country Conference may lead to the establishment of a Three-Country Agreement, which may even lead to the restructuring of Central European countries. (National Telegraph, 11th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) The Austrian government held a banquet at the Hungarian Palace tonight, where the Austrian government representative formally announced the recognition of the "Italian Empire" (i.e., recognizing the Italian King as Emperor of Abyssinia). Today was King Victor Emmanuel III's birthday. During the banquet, Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg and Hungarian Foreign Minister Kanya specifically raised their glasses to celebrate the boundless longevity of the Italian monarch, using the title "King of Italy and Emperor of Abyssinia" to express formal recognition. Kanya then announced that the Hungarian Regent Admiral Horthy would soon visit Rome, where he would formally present the official document recognizing the "Italian Empire" to the Italian monarch with great ceremony. Count Ciano then raised his glass to thank the governments of Austria and Hungary, stating, "The Italo-Austro-Hungarian Protocol has opened the path to coordination and stability among the European countries. It should be known that the purpose of this protocol is not to divide the countries with interests in the Danube region, but rather to promote coordination and establish good relations among these countries." According to Italian sources after the banquet, they were very satisfied with the fact that Austria and Hungary recognized the "Italian Empire" on the King's birthday, and stated that "the imminent exchange of ambassadors between Italy and Austria, whose letters of credence will all use the title 'King of Italy and Emperor of Abyssinia,' shows that Austria has already recognized the Italian Empire in fact. This is only to further solidify it." (Havas Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The result of the meeting of the Italian, Austrian, and Hungarian foreign ministers in Vienna is that Austria and Hungary will legally recognize Italy's annexation of Abyssinia, which is almost a certainty. The German government had already formally recognized the "Italian Empire" when Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano visited Germany. As for Austria and Albania, the recent appointments of ambassadors to Italy all used the title "King of Italy and Emperor of Abyssinia" in their letters of credence. Therefore, Austria and Hungary's formal recognition of the "Italian Empire" should not be a problem. However, the letters of credence presented by the new American ambassador to Italy and the new ambassadors to Italy from Egypt, Iraq, Haiti, and Estonia did not mention the "Italian Empire." (Havas Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Budapest) People in the Hungarian capital generally hope that the Vienna Conference will address the issue of Hungary's equal rights to military armaments, and believe that the Vienna Conference will issue a solemn declaration stating that the equal rights of Italy, Austria, and Hungary are a key element stipulated in the Three-Country Rome Protocol. Currently, only Hungary has not yet enjoyed this equal right. (Note: This refers to the right to equal military armaments.) Furthermore, general observers believe that the Vienna Conference must adopt a clear stance on the issue of the restoration of the Habsburg dynasty in Austria, and this aspect should be given importance. In addition, Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano will visit the Hungarian capital after the Vienna Conference, scheduled to arrive here on the 13th of this month. The city is currently preparing a grand welcome ceremony. The Hungarian "Revisionist United" party has issued a notice asking people to gather at the train station to greet him, and flags will be hung on the streets of the capital to show welcome. (Havas Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Budapest) Newspapers in the Hungarian capital recently commented on the conference of the foreign ministers of Italy, Austria, and Hungary, saying that the only result achieved by the conference so far is the recognition of Italy's annexation of Abyssinia. As for what specific benefits Hungary has gained, it is still unknown. The semi-official Hungarian Daily, which has always advocated revision of the treaties, hopes that the relevant parties can issue a statement to explain that even if Italy and Yugoslavia, and Austria and Czechoslovakia, reach agreements in the future, Hungary's hopes for treaty revision, and even the support of Germany and Italy in principle for Hungary's revision of the treaties, will not be hindered.

<h3>End of British-Polish Talks; Future Western European Pact to Guarantee Polish Interests</h3>
<p>(London) After several meetings between British Foreign Secretary Eden and Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck, who plans to stay here for four days, it was officially announced today that the opinions and aspirations of Britain and Poland are completely aligned. It is reported that both parties have agreed to find ways to guarantee Poland's legitimate interests in the future Western European pact, and both believe that international cooperation can best be maintained within the League of Nations. If Europe is divided into opposing groups, there will be no peaceful days in Europe. (Reuters Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) The Polish government is extremely concerned about the Western European Security Pact currently under negotiation, and hopes that the Western European Security Pact will not isolate Poland. This concern has attracted the attention of the British side since the arrival of Foreign Minister Burke of that country. This is the main result of Colonel Burke's visit to Britain. It is reported that Burke has received assurances from the British government that any new pacts that the Western European countries may conclude in the future will not affect the alliance treaty between France and Poland. The alliance between France and Poland was renewed when Polish Army Education Director General Rydz-Śmigły visited France in August of this year, and it remains effective. This British guarantee is sufficient to show that Britain's viewpoint is the same as France's, that is, it recognizes that the Eastern European issue is of great importance. If a thorough solution to the European and French situation is desired, it cannot be limited to considering the Western European issue. In addition, it is reported that the issues involved in the talks between Foreign Secretary Eden and Burke are very wide-ranging. According to general confirmation, Eden asked Burke to pay attention to Britain's view that the improvement of relations between Poland and Czechoslovakia is extremely important. Some people think that the relations between Czechoslovakia and Poland are only related to the two countries and have nothing to do with other countries, but Britain cannot agree with this view. (Havas Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Burke has completed his visit to Britain and talks with Foreign Secretary Eden, and set off for home at 2 pm today. (Havas Dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>Fascist Party Supreme Council to Amend Constitution</h3>

Prime Minister Mussolini will report on the common policies decided diplomatically by the Italian, Austrian, and Hungarian foreign ministers' conference, the situation of Italy's military armaments, and the implementation of Italy's economic self-sufficiency plan.

<h3>Heavy Artillery Duels Continue in Spanish Capital, Situation Unchanged</h3>
<p>(Paris) Today, according to a telephone notification from the Argentine Embassy in Madrid to the Associated Press, the war situation in the Spanish capital is unchanged. A large number of reinforcements from Catalonia continue to arrive. Artillery duels continue in the suburbs of the Manzanares River area. (National Telegraph, 12th)</p>
<p>(Madrid) The Nationalists' attack on Madrid has become more fierce today. Shells are exploding everywhere in the city. The positions of the Nationalist artillery are the same as the previous two days, indicating that the government forces can only stop the enemy's advance but cannot repel them. Residents are pessimistic about the war situation, which is completely contrary to the optimistic news reported in the newspapers. People are indifferent to the rumors of government forces winning victories in various places. (Reuters Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Madrid) A Reuters reporter inspected the position of the government forces and sent a telegram stating that the Nationalists' attempt to enter the capital had again been decisively defeated. The Nationalists' target of attack was the French Bridge. Although the government forces were bombarded by heavy artillery, tanks, machine guns, and hand grenades, their morale was strong, and they defended their positions firmly. They indicated the enemy trenches with humor. Soon, the Nationalists rushed out of the Colmenarejos area, covered by foreign legions and Moorish artillery, with a great chance of success, but the defending troops had taken accurate aim, and the artillery and machine guns fired at the same time, with bullets raining down. The attacking army was defeated and rushed to the nearby destroyed houses to hide. The streets in the center of the capital are still very dangerous, with shells falling from time to time. The sound of exploding shells is mixed with the sound of machine guns, making pedestrians tremble. (Reuters Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Madrid) This agency's reporter, Shadote, reports that at 3:30 this morning, the Nationalist army mobilized a large number of Moroccan native troops and foreign legions, and used tanks and heavy artillery to assist in the battle, and launched a fierce attack on the city, attempting to seize the French Bridge near the North Railway Station. The government forces fought bravely to resist, and finally repelled them at dawn. Until noon, fierce artillery fire broke out again in the western suburbs leading to the Autostrada province, because the Nationalist army was attacking that place. Several shells fired by the Nationalist army fell in the southeastern part of the city, and the sound of the explosions was deafening. The western park was also hit by the Nationalist army's artillery fire. Two more shells fell near the French University, injuring two Spaniards. A bell tower of the university, built in the 17th century, was also slightly damaged. The sound of machine guns is quite dense at the moment. (Havas Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Madrid) Today, the heavy artillery of the rebels at the Vientos airfield and the artillery of the government army fought fiercely, shaking the entire capital. An Associated Press reporter overlooked the battle situation from a high building, only seeing shells flying. One shell hit the ruins of an ammunition factory near the Montaña military camp, and the factory immediately caught fire, spreading to neighboring houses. One shell hit the Paraguayan Embassy, ​​but fortunately, no one was injured. At present, the government forces are still using machine guns and hand grenades to resist in the western suburbs, but neither side is using aircraft to assist in the battle. (National Telegraph, 11th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Chilean Embassy in Spain notified the Associated Press by telephone that the Madrid municipal regiment fought fiercely with the rebels in the Rosales area today. There were many casualties on both sides, and the rebels were finally driven back. The claim that a large fire broke out in the city of Madrid is not accurate. The Madrid diplomatic corps met today and decided to appeal to both sides to avoid bombing civilians. (National Telegraph, 11th)</p>
<p>(Madrid) Today, the local regiment of this capital surrounded 1,000 rebels in the west of the city, most of whom are Moorish native soldiers and foreign legions, and they will soon be completely annihilated. (National Telegraph, 12th)</p>
<p>(Lisbon) According to a statement by Nationalist Army Commander General Franco published by the Lisbon Radio Club, the Nationalist Army will continue to bombard Madrid until it surrenders. The city will be destroyed district by district. Although I regret it, I can't help it. (Reuters Dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Seville) According to news from the local radio station, the Nationalist Army is currently preparing to launch a new large-scale offensive against Madrid. It is reported that the 17th Division has consolidated its position to make a new attack. The government army has counterattacked twice, and it is reported that they were defeated and suffered heavy losses. At the same time, according to Valencia news, ten government planes flew from Alicante to Palma, the largest island in the Balearic Islands, today to bombard the Nationalists' fortress. (Reuters Dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Hengtai) Today, according to a radio broadcast from the Spanish rebels, Nationalist Army Commander Franco has ordered a temporary halt to the attack on Madrid in order to consolidate the positions near the capital. (National Telegraph, 12th)</p>
<p>(Valencia) Since the Madrid government moved to this place, although some departments of the cabinet have not yet been arranged, Prime Minister Caballero, Minister of Navy and Aviation Prieto, and Foreign Minister Talva Yu have left here to go to various cities to supervise the deployment of defenses. The first government bulletin has been published, with very few pages, only four pages. As for the local anarchists' union, it plans to hold an important meeting in the short term in order to decide on emergency measures to deal with emergency events. Furthermore, it is rumored that the airfield set up by the Nationalist Army in Avila, 90 kilometers west of Madrid, was bombed by government planes. It is reported that more than 20 Nationalist planes were destroyed, and this statement has been confirmed by local officials. (Havas Dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>Neutrality Committee Plans to Establish International Committee to Monitor Spanish Government</h3>
<p>(London) The sub-committee of the Committee on Non-Intervention in the Spanish Civil War is scheduled to hold its tenth meeting today, and will complete the drafting of the plan to establish an international committee to monitor Spanish seaports and borders. It will be submitted to the plenary meeting of the Coordinating Committee tomorrow for discussion. This plan stipulates that two monitoring committees should be established in various seaports and borders in Spain, to be responsible for monitoring matters in the territories of the Spanish government forces and the Nationalist forces, respectively. The airfields in various places should also be monitored in order to avoid foreign munitions being transported to Spain by plane. This is a proposal put forward by the Soviet Union. As for the Soviet government's proposal to monitor the ports of Portugal, it does not seem to be accepted by the Coordinating Committee. (Havas Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the monitoring of Spanish ports and borders, the sub-committee of the Non-Intervention Committee has formulated a plan that advocates the establishment of a monitoring committee within the territories of the Spanish government and the Nationalist army to engage in monitoring work. According to estimates by various experts, after the implementation of this plan, the required expenses will reach as much as 1 million pounds per year. Therefore, one of the future tasks of the committee is to apportion the above expenses according to the size of the vested interests of each member state. In addition, the Coordinating Committee will also discuss the future outline of the work of the monitoring committee at its meeting this afternoon, as well as the Soviet government's reply to the points pointed out by the Italian representative. (According to the Italian representative, two Soviet steamships, "Kuban" and "Nava," were carrying a batch of munitions to Spain to help the government forces in that country.)

<h3>Total Number of Members of British Trade Unions: 4.8 Million</h3>
<p>(London) The British Ministry of Labor issued a communique stating that as of the end of 1935, the total number of members of trade unions nationwide was 4,842,000, an increase of 272,000 compared to the end of 1934. Among them, there were 4,080,000 men, an increase of 246,000 over the previous year, and 726,000 women, an increase of 25,000 over the previous year. The latest total amount includes 35,000 members of various branches of the Irish Free State and 31,000 members of various overseas branches. Among the trade unions, the most members belong to the transportation industry and ordinary labor unions. The combined membership of the Transportation and General Workers' Union and the National Union of General and Municipal Workers has reached as many as 793,000. Most of the female members belong to the textile and teaching industries. As for the decrease in the number of trade unions, the main reason is due to mergers and the absorption of most small trade unions by larger ones. Therefore, at the peak at the end of 1920, there were a total of 1,379 trade unions, but by the end of 1935, it had decreased to 1,042. The total number of members of the Trade Union Federation of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was 2,730,000 at the end of 1935, while it was only 2,712,000 at the end of 1934.

<h3>Romanian Liberal Party Demonstration</h3>
<p>The ruling Liberal Party of Romania recently held a demonstration in Oradea Mare, Outer Transylvania Province, to express opposition to Hungary's call for treaty revision. Party leader Bratianu, Cabinet Counselor Ingulescu, former cabinet members Nistor, Rabeda, and Babo all participated. Bratianu gave a speech, saying, "Our country will never give up an inch of land." When Italian Prime Minister Mussolini delivered a speech in Milan, he said that Hungary was "a crippled country." It should be known that Romania was also a crippled country before the European war. At that time, there were three places where Romanian ethnic groups lived that were controlled by foreign countries: Bessarabia Province was occupied by Russia, Outer Transylvania Province, and Bukovina Province were occupied by Hungary. After the European War, thanks to the support of the British and French forces, they were able to be incorporated into our country's territory. Among them, Outer Transylvania Province had been reduced to foreign territory for thousands of years. (Note: This province was seized back from Hungary.) After the Second Balkan War in 1913, Romania and other victorious countries signed the Treaty of Bucharest with Bulgaria. At that time, Bulgaria was a defeated country, like the Treaty of Trianon signed after the European War, and Hungary was a defeated country, but in terms of the way the Treaty of Bucharest treated Bulgaria, the nature of the Treaty of Trianon had been greatly eased. In short, if we want to maintain peace, the principle of national self-determination must be respected at all times. The conclusion is that our country's policy of rearming still needs to continue, because this policy, in the current situation, "is not a thing of the past." (Havas Dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>Rumor of Reorganization of German Political Institutions; Politics Controlled by Deputy</h3>
<p>(Paris) Mrs. Tabuy, a diplomatic reporter for Shiye Bao, recently issued shocking news that the domestic political institutions of Germany will soon be completely reorganized, and all political affairs will be subject to the jurisdiction of military power. "Chief and Prime Minister Hitler will only be high above, and all political power will be exercised by the Deputy Prime Minister, who is likely to be the current Minister of Aviation and 'Four-Year Plan Dictator' General Göring. Under him is an Executive Council, composed of three members, with Göring concurrently serving as the Dean. The three members are the current Ambassador to Britain, Ribbentrop, a confidant of Chief Hitler, Mr. Keberler, a rival to Economic Minister Schacht, and the other member of the Executive Council is unknown. As for the Chamber of Deputies, it will be dissolved and replaced by a Senate. The Senate will consist of a total of 200 senators. Once this plan is implemented, it is tantamount to placing the national power of Germany in the hands of the military." (Havas Dispatch, 12th)</p>

<h3>European Armistice Anniversary: Britain and France Commemorate Fallen Soldiers</h3>
<p>London: Yesterday was Armistice Day. In the evening, the British Legion held a memorial service for fallen soldiers at the Royal Albert Hall. The King, as a member, attended the meeting. An independent speaker addressed the audience, and his conclusion quoted the British poet laureate Binyon, saying, "At the going down of the sun and in the morning, we will remember them." The thousands of listeners responded with "We will remember them." Throughout the ceremony, the crowd cheered for the King. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>London: The King, in plain clothes, visited Westminster Abbey today to view the memorial square illuminated by electric lights. He planted an ordinary wooden cross, engraved with the number of His Majesty King George V, in the square. The first to notice the King were several children. The King stood silently with his head uncovered, then braved the rain and water to inspect the red poppies with other mourners before leaving the square. The King purchased two poppies from a veteran and threw a roll of banknotes into an iron box. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Paris: Today is the anniversary of the European armistice. Celebrations were held here. A large group of veterans marched past the tomb of the unknown soldier of the European War in silence. All veterans, regardless of political party, marched in formation. Even the Communist Congressman Fan Yang Gudulier and the chairman of the Royalist Veterans Association, Heli Gu, walked side by side, which attracted much attention. After all the veterans had passed, the police allowed the public to join the parade. At that time, the rain stopped, and people on the Champs-Élysées who had been sheltering from the rain in the cafes on both sides of the street went out to join the procession, heading towards the tomb of the unknown soldier under the Arc de Triomphe. The scene at that time was very solemn. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>Rome: Today is the anniversary of the European armistice, and also the 66th birthday of King Victor Emmanuel III. A grand military parade was held as usual, but the King has been unwell recently and was unable to attend in person. (Havas, 11th)</p>

<h3>Proceedings of the 17th League of Nations Assembly (Continued)</h3>
<p>1. The Question of Abyssinian Representation... 2. The Work of Chinese Representatives in Various Committees (A) First Committee (B) Second Committee (C) Third Committee (D) Fourth Committee (E) Fifth Committee (F) Sixth Committee... 3. The Question of Reorganization of the League of Nations Covenant... 4. Representative Gu's Speech in the General Discussion of the Assembly... 5. The Election of China to the Council of the League of Nations and to the Hague Tribunal... 6. Conclusion...</p>
<p>2. The Work of Chinese Representatives in Various Committees: The organization of the committees is the same every year, except for the Third Committee, which was not organized for four sessions from the 1932 General Assembly to last year's General Assembly. This is because the committee was specifically established for the issue of disarmament. Since the start of the 1932 International Disarmament Conference, the work of the committee has been transferred to the Disarmament Conference, so there is no need for organization. Now, because the Disarmament Conference has been suspended for a long time, and countries are increasingly competing to increase armaments, international peace is also increasingly feeling endangered. In recent years, various international peace movements have been brewing to restore the Disarmament Conference. At the same time, since Germany abolished the Locarno Treaty, the spirits of Britain and France, especially France, have almost entirely focused on the Rhine. On the other hand, the purpose of lifting sanctions against Italy, in the Locarno issue, has not had any remedy. The Italian government's non-committal attitude is far from the hopes of France. Therefore, France's panic is greater than that of any other country in Europe, and she feels that the role of the Disarmament Conference is urgently needed. The revival of this year's Third Committee is the biggest reason for this, and in fact it was established based on the proposals of France and the small Nordic countries. Regarding the work of the Third Committee, the reporter will describe it in another chapter. In this year's General Assembly's various committees, except for the Credentials Committee, the Chinese delegation has participated in all of them. Among them, the most important, such as the Agenda Committee, is organized by the chairman of the General Assembly. Our representative, Guo, was assigned as one of the seven representatives on the committee. For the remaining committees, each delegation applied to participate. Gu attended the First and Third Committees, Jin attended the Second Committee, Liang attended the Fourth Committee, Qian attended the Fifth Committee, and Guo attended the Sixth Committee. Now, the work of our representatives in each committee will be described separately above.</p>
<p>First Committee: The most relevant issues to China in this year's First Committee were the reorganization of the Council of the League of Nations and the supplementary election of the Hague Tribunal. Regarding the reorganization of the Council of the League of Nations, after the report of the Council Reorganization Committee was passed by the Council meeting in May of this year, it has been submitted to this year's General Assembly. It will first be reviewed by the First Committee and then executed by the General Assembly. At the first meeting of the First Committee, this issue was specifically discussed. After the chairman of the committee read the report, our representative, Gu, stood up to explain China's reasons for hoping to participate in the Council, saying that China's request is based on the general purpose of the League of Nations Covenant. When I participated in the 1911 Council meeting, I drew attention to the importance of geographical distribution and rotation of Council seats. Since the number of League of Nations members has increased, the number of Council representatives should also be increased to conform to this purpose. Now, all continents of the world have seats, but Asia has no representative. Although Asian member states have always expressed loyal support for the League of Nations under various panics, Asia should have a representative, not only because it has significant practical value for the League of Nations itself, but also because of China's dominant position in Asian countries in terms of population, and the relationship between the League of Nations and China in terms of technical cooperation and various construction assistance. Subsequently, the Australian representative rose to support the significance of the report, but reserved its government's opinion until there were concrete results. The Chilean representative also expressed acceptance of the significance of the report and supported Representative Gu's proposal. The Swiss representative said that the number of Council seats should be limited to the extent possible to prevent the diffusion of responsibility. If the Council is expanded, it could also become a miniature version of the General Assembly, which is not in the interest of the League of Nations. Therefore, this proposal must be specifically designed for member states that most urgently hope to restore their Council position under the most reasonable term. The Council must be based on the foundation of its democratic spirit and should not exclude a certain country in practice. The Swiss government has always sympathized with the permanent Council seats of major powers and has never requested a Council seat due to its neutral policy. In order to solve the current problem, I would like to express my support for the opinion of the report. The Iranian representative said that Iran has always advocated that Asia must occupy two seats according to the geographical and racial conditions of the Asian continent, one seat for East Asia and one seat for West Asia. The current seat of Turkey should allow West Asia to continue to occupy it. The Norwegian representative expressed support for the Swiss opinion. The representatives of Siam and Lithuania also supported the significance of the report and supported the request of our representative. Turkey, Afghanistan, and Iraq seconded the motion. The Iranian and Argentine representatives supported Representative Gu's proposal, saying that it is not enough to guarantee the meaning of the general purpose of the League of Nations without it. Finally, the chairman, Belgian representative Roland, said that although Belgium has not participated in the Council for ten years, its national interests and dignity have not suffered because of it. Although small countries need to participate in the Council, they should think about the importance of their responsibility, although they do not necessarily have to pursue it, but sometimes they cannot escape it. It is becoming a contradiction to reduce the influence of small countries in the Council by increasing the position of the Council to suit democratic principles. As a result, major powers seek solutions outside the Council when solving serious problems, and for the sake of giving all member states the opportunity to speak in the Council, whenever interests involve non-Council countries, Article 5 of the Covenant can be cited, and they may be invited to attend the Council. Therefore, he (the Belgian representative) proposed that if the situation permits in the future, a special committee should be organized to find a permanent solution. If this issue was not already a fact, the Belgian's remarks could have dismissed our seat in the Council. In his sarcastic tone, there was also a hint of contempt, as if to say that before our country requests a Council seat, we should first think about whether we can bear the responsibility, and if we cannot bear the responsibility, it is better not to request it. We are very clear about his mission. The Belgian representative's non-participation in the Reorganization Committee in May of this year (at which time the Belgian representative was still in Geneva) is enough to express his intention this time. What is especially worth pondering is that his tone carried the accent of a Frenchman, but on the other hand, it was not without our own criticism. Our ability to be elected is probably because we have not yet reached the situation in Abyssinia. The opinions of the Belgian representative, France, Hungary, Cuba, and other representatives all agreed with the taste. However, the report has been passed by the Council and cannot be overturned, so they also agreed to the report. As for the representatives of Poland, Latvia, Yugoslavia, and others, they all agreed with the Belgian representative's opinion and advocated that one of the two seats to be added should still be left to the Near East countries. The representatives of Venezuela, Sweden, Mexico, Albania, and the Union of South Africa all expressed their agreement with the significance of the report, but the representative of Sweden said that the number of Council seats could not be expanded again in the future. He wished to invite Finland to join the group of old neutral countries. The Belgian representative's opinion has been revised at the request of our representative, and the committee has no other differences in its conclusions on the report, so it was passed and transferred to the General Assembly. Regarding the Hague International Court of Justice, that is, to fill the three vacancies for judges, one was for former German judge Walter Schücking, one was for American judge Frank Kellogg, and one was for the vacancy of Dr. Wang Chonghui. On the American side, former Secretary of State Stimson was recommended as one of the candidates, but Mr. Stimson declined with all his might. He then recommended Manley Hudson. Our candidate was Dr. Zheng Tianxi. The countries recommending Mr. Zheng totaled thirty until the end. There were originally thirty-six names on the list of candidates. Many candidates did not want to run, in other words, they knew that the hope was very small, so they withdrew. As a result, there were nineteen left. When the committee discussed the election method, there were two opinions. The first opinion advocated adopting the elimination system, and making one election from the nineteen candidates. The proposer was the Greek representative Polychroniadis, and the seconders were Turkey, Belgium, Latvia, Finland, and other countries. The second opinion advocated holding two run-off elections, that is, one election for the vacancies of Kellogg and Schücking, and another election for the vacancy of Dr. Wang Chonghui. The proposer of the second opinion was the United Kingdom, and the seconders were Poland, France, and our country. The committee debated fiercely at the second meeting and there was no proper solution. At the third meeting, it was put to a vote. As a result, the majority voted in favor of holding two run-off elections, so it was passed to adopt the second opinion. According to the first candidate list (the election for two vacancies), there were sixteen people in total: Chile 1, Latvia 1, Equatorial Guinea 1, Haiti 1, Venezuela 1, Sweden 1, Norway 2, United States 1, Brazil 1, Turkey 2, Ireland 1, India 1, Mexico 1, Austria 1. The second election (Dr. Wang Chonghui's vacancy) had seven names on the list. Originally, there were only two names, one for Panama, one for Portugal, and one for Dr. Zheng Tianxi. Turkey saw that the situation on the first list was not good, and opened the United States and Switzerland with the best hope of being elected, so they thought of a clever method to move the two candidates on the first candidate list to the second candidate list, thinking that competing with China would always be easier than with the United States and Sweden. It is said that Turkey started the activity of judge election the earliest, but the result was always inevitable failure. Afterwards, our representative Guo once said that the sick man of the Near East often wants to bully the sick man of the Far East. Although the words are funny, the fact is indeed so. Turkey competed with our country for the Council of the League of Nations in 1934, and this year they wanted to compete with us for the judge. It is also heard that they often have jealous expressions of our country's victory in the two elections. How unsatisfied is this sick man of the Near East! (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Recent Trends in North China Economic Development: Song Zheyuan Says Everything Has Not Yet Been Implemented; Ikeda Has Returned to Tianjin After Consulting in Tokyo</h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Song Zheyuan came to Tianjin last week to preside over the wedding of his niece, Miss Yu Jie, and took the opportunity to meet with the commander of the Japanese garrison in Tianjin, Tashiro, to exchange opinions on various matters related to North China's diplomacy and economic development. He left Tianjin in the afternoon of the 11th and returned to Peiping. During Song's stay in Tianjin this time, in addition to issuing a brief statement on the 7th regarding diplomatic and economic matters, he met with reporters at 3:00 PM on the 9th at his mother's residence on Qiangzi Road in the British Concession, and discussed the current situation and North China's circumstances in detail. Among them, there are a few words that are enough to be thought-provoking and dispel external rumors. He said, "There are four people in my life that I admire the least: Shi Kefa, Wen Tianxiang, Hong Chengchou, and Wu Sangui. There are two people I admire the most: Guo Fenyang and Zeng Wenzheng. Shi knew that the general trend was gone, but he still defended Yangzhou with blood, causing the people to suffer. He was ignorant and unwise. Wen Tianxiang sacrificed himself to achieve benevolence, exhausting his loyalty, only to win personal heroic honor. Hong Chengchou was the first person in the biography of treacherous officials. Wu Sangui, to vent his personal anger, colluded with foreign forces to kill his compatriots. The morality of these four people, compared to Guo and Zeng's determination to save the country and turn danger into safety, cannot be measured by distance. Last year, I took charge of the political situation in Hebei and Chahar, and rumors abounded. Over the past year, everything I have suggested, I believe there is absolutely no secret to it. I am fighting for a page of historical records. Decades later, right and wrong will be judged fairly. Current fame and wealth have long been put aside. As for navigation, this is a public case that has existed since the Green Tanggu Agreement. Today, I am only completing unfinished procedures. The funds are definitely half from China and half from Japan. Our share of the funds will be raised from the tax revenues of the Hebei Provincial Bank and the Yizhong Tobacco Company, amounting to 1.35 million, not all funded by the Japanese side. For example, economic cooperation involves the issue of funds. I advocate the principle of equality and mutual benefit, ordering experts to discuss it. When it is necessary to borrow money, I will also use three points as the basis for consultation: (1) The money must be paid in full, without any discounts; (2) Cancel handling fees and rebates; (3) The interest must be reduced. By following this, we can achieve the goal of mutual assistance. Previously in Peiping, someone asked about the above matters, and I told them what kind of person Song is. Over time, it will become clear. If I am a traitor, please come and overthrow me. If I am a patriot, please come and support me. The country has come to this point, and the people should avoid suspicion and cooperate sincerely. China is not without a solution, it depends on whether everyone is willing to take responsibility. If the Chinese people do not want to destroy their own country, who can destroy it? The situation in North China should also be viewed in this way. The press has the responsibility to guide public opinion. Today, I meet you and sincerely tell you this." Song continued that there is no secret to North China's economic cooperation. Recently, only navigation has been handled. After Ikeda returned to China, I have not seen him. Li Zanhou will return north in a few days. If I do not return to Peiping, he may come to Tianjin to meet. "</p>
<p>At 6:30 PM on the 9th, Tashiro, because Ikeda had returned from Tokyo and had obtained the Japanese central government's intention on economic cooperation, specially held a banquet at his official residence on Miyajima Street, as it was necessary to negotiate with Song. Those invited to the banquet at the same time included Qi Xieyuan, Cao Rulin, Jia Deyao, Zhang Zizhong, Chen Juesheng, etc. Those accompanying were Iida, Ikeda, Senda, Kai, etc. Ikeda, based on the instructions from Tokyo, negotiated with Song for a long time. Although the outline of this matter has been determined, how it should be handled depends on the issue of funds. It is necessary to wait for Li Sihao to return before discussing it directly with Ikeda. It is said that as a result of Ikeda's activities in returning to China, although the domestic financial groups have slightly moved their intention to invest, they strongly opposed the Xingzhong Company's method of monopolizing the increase of capital and controlling development. This is because the general financial groups deeply feel that if they invest a lot of capital, they must have the right to operate freely. If the development is restricted by any party, it will not be satisfactory. The final result of Ikeda's contact is that the financial groups have almost bluntly stated that if the Xingzhong Company's control policy is cancelled, it is still possible to jointly initiate investment. Therefore, after Ikeda returned to Tianjin, he has studied with the Japanese military headquarters. Tashiro specially ordered staff officer Senda to go to Changchun on the 10th to meet with Itagaki and Imamura to exchange opinions in order to provide a guideline for implementation. (10th)</p>
<h3>Fujian Province Implements Complete Prohibition of Opium: Native Soil Within the People Is Limited to Being Cleared; Private Soil Imports Are Investigated</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Since the implementation of opium prohibition in this province, the source of opium can be divided into three types: (1) Taxed Soil, which is opium taxed and stamped by the Opium Prohibition Supervision Office. This opium comes from Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Gansu, and other provinces, and is transported to Hankou. After the General Office verifies and affixes the stamp tax ticket, it is purchased and transported by the province's Yumin Company, and stored in the Tu Gao firms in Xiamen and Fuzhou. Then, the two Tu Gao firms sell it to the Tu Gao shops in various counties, and opium smokers with opium cessation licenses purchase it from the local Shi Gao shops. These Tu Gao shops are operated for a period of one year, and the licenses are renewed for operation upon expiration. The business licenses are divided into four grades: Grade A for monthly sales of more than 5,000 taels, Grade B for monthly sales of more than 2,500 taels, Grade C for monthly sales of more than 1,800 taels, and Grade D for monthly sales of more than 1,000 taels. (2) Native Soil, which is the old opium stored by farmers in various counties in southern and eastern Fujian who used to grow opium seedlings. Due to the impact of the opium control and sale, they have no way to sell it, so the quantity is still very large. The three agencies of administrative, military, and opium prohibition have jointly organized a special committee to clear local products, dividing the counties in eastern and southern Fujian into four districts, and sending special commissioners to each district to cooperate with the county governments and garrison troops to ascertain the quantity of opium stored by the people, and uniformly order them to pay taxes and affix stamps, allowing them to sell and clear it within six months. In the future, if any remaining soil is found, it will be regarded as private soil, and in addition to confiscation, they will also be prosecuted. (3) Private Soil, which is all transported from Hong Kong, Macau, and Dalian by British and Japanese steamships, and sold cheaply inland without paying taxes and affixing stamps. Recently, the import of private soil has been increasing day by day, which has greatly affected the sales of taxed soil. The opium prohibition agencies are conducting strict investigations. However, a group of large opium merchants, such as Lin Wu, have recently raised 100,000 yuan to organize a large-scale private soil company, preparing to transport large quantities of opium from Hong Kong and Macau to the province for sale, and entrusted someone with 10,000 yuan to persuade the agency to transport it for them. The主管長官 discovered the matter and was greatly enraged, and has sent personnel to strictly arrest and investigate it. Now, the provincial government, considering that this province is an absolutely prohibited planting and time-limited prohibition province, is known for the counties of Yunxiao, Dongshan, and Zhao'an, which used to be the most prosperous in opium production. Although the opium seedlings were cleared last year, the bandit forces are now spreading day by day. I am deeply afraid that the farmers will take advantage of the military and political agencies' lack of time to take care of them during the suppression of bandits, and secretly plant them again between this autumn and winter. Yesterday, I specially ordered the governments of each county to cooperate with the local garrison troops to strictly prevent it. The prohibition of planting opium seedlings should be regarded as equally important as the suppression of local bandits. From the 16th of this month, a provincial opium prohibition conference will be convened for five days. The governments of each county must send the county magistrate or the主管科長 to the province to participate, report on the situation of opium prohibition and sales in the county, and publicly discuss the future opium prohibition plan of the province in order to complete the opium prohibition policy as scheduled. The representatives of each county have already brought proposals and successively come to the province to report. (November 12)</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Guangdong Provincial Security Command; Provincial Guards Reorganized into Security Command</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: Since the active training of the Guangdong Provincial Guards in recent years, significant progress has been made in organizing reserve and auxiliary forces. During Chen Jitang's tenure as head of military and political affairs, the guards were brought under the direct command of the highest military authority, and a Guards Office was established to handle training matters. With the renewal of the Guangdong situation, the original Guards Office was transferred to the Fourth Route Army Headquarters. Recently, the Military Affairs Commission of the Ministry of Military Affairs again reorganized the Guangdong Guards, renaming them the Security Command. Huang Musong, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, was appointed concurrently as Security Commander, and Zou Hong, Commander of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway Garrison, was appointed as the Director of the Security Command. Huang and Zou, upon receiving their appointments, were sworn into office on the 2nd of this month. Besides Zou Hong as Director, the Security Command also has a Deputy Director, with Chi Zhongkuan filling the role. The Security Command is reorganized from the original Guards Office, but the organization has been expanded. Under the Director and Deputy Director, there is one Chief of Staff, one Secretary-General, and one Military Judge. In addition, there are the Inspector's Office, Telegraph Translation Room, Office, and Sections 1, 2, 3, and 4. The total monthly expenditure of the Command is 20,000 yuan. Section 1 is divided into Compilation and Training, Conscription, and Intelligence subsections, with Yu Bin appointed as Section Chief. Section 2 is divided into General Affairs, Transportation, Sanitation, and Personnel subsections, with Bo Junhong as Section Chief. Section 3 is divided into Training and Statistics subsections, with Lin Huan as Section Chief. Section 4 is divided into Accounting, Auditing, and Ordnance subsections, with Feng Jielian as Section Chief. Furthermore, Tu Kuan is appointed as Chief of Staff, Wu Ziquan as Lieutenant Colonel Secretary, and a Mr. He as Military Judge. Most of the subsection chiefs, clerks, and secretaries are former members of the Guards Office. Previously, there were many Guards Inspectors responsible for inspecting guards in outer counties. These inspectors have now been uniformly renamed Security Inspectors. As for the security zones, they are divided according to administrative inspection zones, with the Administrative Inspectors concurrently serving as commanders of each security zone, and deputy commanders directly appointed by the Security Command. After the provincial guards were renamed the Security Command, reorganization was immediately initiated.</p>
<h3>Bandit Ship Discovered in Weiting Township, Suzhou</h3>
<p>In Weiting Town, Suzhou, in the Yuanyang River area, one *li* from the town, three bandit ships arrived at dusk on the 11th. They carried over twenty bandits armed with guns and with ill intentions. Fortunately, the locals were alerted and fired shots to deter them. The bandits, not daring to act, fled towards Yangcheng Lake. The responsible police precinct, upon receiving the report, dispatched police to pursue them overnight, but they were nowhere to be found.</p>
<h3>Investigation into Roadside Fire</h3>
<p>The fire that engulfed four businesses, including the Da Zhonghua Hat Factory on the main road outside the gate the other day, resulted in substantial losses. It is now known that the Public Security Bureau has handed over the fire starter, Qian Peisen, to the District Prosecutor's Office, which has released him on bail pending investigation. Da Zhonghua Account Factory had a fire insurance policy of 10,000 yuan with Tianyi Insurance Company. The company sent personnel to Suzhou yesterday to investigate and determined that an investigation into the cause of the fire was necessary. Therefore, the issue of compensation will be resolved after the investigation is completed.</p>
<h3>Unprecedented Fire on Huiqin Road, Wuxi</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of autumn, there has been little rainfall in the region, and the weather has been dry. Fires have been frequently reported in both urban and rural areas. At approximately 11:00 AM on the 12th, a fire broke out in a small room downstairs in the home of Yan Jiulang, resident of the fourth household of the sixth *jia* of Huiqin Road, outside Beidou in the town of Huiqin. The fire was accidentally started, and Chen Fujin and Zhu Aji, who lived with Yan Jiulang, were not home at the time. The flames quickly spread, bursting through the roof and spreading to the neighboring homes of Ge Weiqing, Gao Maoquan, Kuang Yaoliang, and others. Due to the wind, the flames spread directly to the houses on the opposite side, numbers 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, and 22, totaling over forty households, including the residences of Wang Along, Yao Jusheng, Wang Jinbao, Li Dexiu, Wang Zhongqi, Luo Azhang, Gao Maoquan, Yang Asi, Zhu Jugen, Li Quanfu, Zhang Kaitai, Chen Laoqi, Wang Genhe, Sheng Defu, Guotai Cargo, and Xiao Juxing Iron Shop, among others. Fire brigades from all sections responded to the alarm and rushed to the scene to fight the fire. The fire was extinguished at around 12:00 PM. The losses in this incident totaled over 10,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin Coal from Liujiang Transported to Shanghai</h3>
<p>In the early summer of this year, stolen coal from Liujiang, disguised as white coal, was transported from Shanghai to Jiangyin, stored in the Changxing warehouse outside the north gate, and then transported to various ports in Wuxi for sale. The Coal Industry Association refused to accept it, and the matter was stopped. The 3,000 tons of stolen coal have remained unclaimed. The other day, three barges were used to transport the coal, intending to gradually transport it back to Shanghai for sale. The First Branch of the Public Security Bureau was requested to detain them, but after the Changxing warehouse sent someone to present the tax receipts, they were immediately released.</p>
<h3>Nantong Confirmed Survey of Cotton Production in Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>The initial estimate of cotton production in various parts of northern Jiangsu Province was 1.3 million *dan* of lint. Subsequently, due to the sunny and dry autumn weather, the late cotton suddenly flourished, and the production increased to more than 1.4 million *dan*. Currently, the Cotton Production Improvement Office has commissioned on-site surveys, regulated cotton brokers, and selected improved cotton varieties.</p>
<h3>Haizhou Weather Turns Cold, Water Begins to Freeze</h3>
<p>The weather in this county has recently changed abruptly and become cold, resembling winter. Wearing lined clothing is no longer sufficient to resist the cold.

<p>After the ceremonial procedures, Tao Baichuan gave a report on the significance of the commemoration, stating, "Today is the Premier's birthday, and it is being enthusiastically commemorated throughout the country. Human life is short, and after death, one becomes like grass and trees, decaying into nothing. However, there are also those who live as long as heaven and earth. Those who live as long as heaven and earth must possess one of three conditions: establishing virtue, establishing merit, or establishing words. The Premier was born at a time when the country was in a perilous state of international political and economic affairs.</p>
<p>The Premier witnessed and experienced this firsthand, and his shock was particularly profound. Therefore, he resolved to launch a revolution. Now, the Premier has been dead for ten years, and the Chinese people still commemorate him enthusiastically. This is precisely because his contributions to the country and the nation were immense, and he possessed the three conditions of establishing virtue, establishing merit, and establishing words. The Three Principles of the People, namely nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood, are the Premier's means of consolidating China's international, political, and economic position. This is establishing virtue. Furthermore, the Premier initiated ten revolutions, overcoming numerous setbacks without succumbing. He finally succeeded in overthrowing the imperial system and establishing the Republic. This is establishing merit. The theory of the Three Principles of the People is profound and extensive, and it is the only great work to save China. Other works, such as the National Reconstruction Program, the Outline of National Reconstruction, and the declaration of the First National Congress, can all be passed down for ten thousand generations without decay. The Premier accomplished this great undertaking that benefits all people and all generations. Therefore, he can remain immortal and live as long as heaven and earth. At this commemorative time, we should follow the Premier's teachings and strive to revive China together. (1) Follow the Premier's last words and make the revival of the Chinese nation our goal. (2) Follow the Three Principles of the People, support the only leader, and contribute personal strength to complete the self-liberation of the Chinese nation, so as not to betray the meaning of commemoration."</p>
<p>Record of Speeches</p>
<p>Following the report, Wang Xiaolai gave a speech, stating, "The national crisis is deepening, and we should act on the idea that 'every citizen is responsible for the rise and fall of the nation' and do our best to work for the country. What we should strive for now is (1) aviation to save the nation; aviation is a powerful weapon for national defense, and we hope that the people of the country will work hard to promote it; (2) using national products; the Chamber of Commerce is launching a one-day movement to contribute to the country, and we hope that the people of the country will make a firm resolution to serve the country." Lu Jingshi then gave a speech, stating, "At this commemorative time, comrades of the Kuomintang should work harder to promote the Premier's teachings, emulate the Premier's fearless spirit, and fight for the country. We should also follow the Premier's instructions at the First National Congress, recognize the sacrifices made for the ideology and individual freedom, and work hard for the Party and the country." Finally, Zhou Xuexiang gave a speech, stating, "Today, as we commemorate the Premier, we should support the only leader and strive to restore the nation."</p>

<p>Civic Education Center</p>
<p>The Municipal Civic Education Center on Wenmiao Road held a commemorative meeting for the Premier's birthday at 10:00 AM yesterday in the center's lecture hall. The meeting was attended by staff, students of the civic schools, members of the martial arts, opera, harmonica, and other groups, and over 300 citizens. Xu Zexiang presided over the meeting, and Li Ziyang was the master of ceremonies. After the bell rang to open the meeting, the ceremonial procedures were followed. The chairman reported on the significance of commemorating the Premier's birthday and invited Zhu Xuefan, chairman of the Shanghai General Labor Union, to give a speech. Zhu said, "When commemorating the Premier's birthday, we must not forget the Premier's teachings, promote the inherent virtues of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, and peace, and not forget the survival of the nation, and strive for the freedom and equality of the nation. There is a saying in Italy: I would rather be a fierce lion for a day than a gentle sheep for a hundred days. In this time of national crisis, we must prepare for the final sacrifice of the nation to achieve the goal of national revival." Then, slogans were shouted, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Two Railway Party Headquarters</p>
<p>The Special Party Headquarters of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways held a commemorative meeting for the Premier's birthday in the auditorium yesterday. All committee members and staff who signed in, as well as over a hundred directors, supervisors, and all staff of the railway labor unions in Shanghai, representatives from the railway bureau, and representatives from schools, attended. Chen Chengshi and Li Dasan, two standing committee members, served as chairmen. First, Chairman Chen respectfully read the Premier's will, followed by Chairman Li Dasan's report on the significance of commemorating the Premier's birthday. He said, "The Premier was born on November 12th, the 46th year before the founding of the Republic of China, in Cuiheng Village, Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province. At that time, after the failure of the Taiping Rebellion, nationalistic ideas permeated the people. The Premier was deeply influenced by this. As he grew older, seeing the daily decline of the country and the people's livelihood becoming increasingly difficult, he advocated revolution to overthrow the autocratic Qing Dynasty in order to rescue the Chinese nation. After ten uprisings, he rose up again and again, and finally, in the Battle of Wuchang, he established the Republic. The Premier's lifelong efforts were aimed at liberating the Chinese nation and the world's weak and small nations. China was spared the disaster of extinction and stood tall and independent in the world. This was all due to the Premier's leadership in the revolution. Therefore, if the Chinese nation did not have the birth of the Premier, there would be no realization of today's democratic politics, nor would there be today's model of political training and construction. When we commemorate the Premier's birthday today, we should follow the Premier's teachings, emulate the Premier's revolutionary spirit, overcome the current national crisis, and strive for the survival of the nation." Then, Chairman Chen Chengshi and Secretary Shi Changguoyuan gave speeches, which were omitted for brevity. Then, slogans were shouted, and the meeting adjourned.</p>

Over 100 people attended. The ceremony began at 8:00 AM. After the ceremonial procedures, Committee Member and Chairman Ji Zhangjian first reported, saying, "To commemorate the Premier's birthday, we must implement the Three Principles of the People and enhance the Party's spirit. The implementation of the ideology and the enhancement of the Party's spirit depend on establishing the Party's center and the Party members setting an example. To put it plainly, all of us Party members must absolutely, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, the inheritor of the Party, strive for spiritual and material revolutionary construction. If so, then saving the country from its difficulties will be easier than turning one's hand." Committee Member and Secretary-General Shi Ziya then gave a speech, saying, "Commemorating the Premier's birthday is commemorating the birthday of the Republic of China. We should accept the Premier's teachings, support the leader, strive for aviation construction, pay attention to mass training, guide national education, save the country from its difficulties, and revive the nation." Finally, slogans were shouted, and the atmosphere at the meeting was extremely enthusiastic.</p>

After the ceremonial procedures and the chairman's brief report, Comrade Li Boqing, the representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, delivered a speech, followed by a speech by Mr. Zhang Yuanruo, the secretary of the Municipal Government. The theme of the speech was "The Ideal and Spirit of the Chinese Revolution," which stated that the ideal should have objective and subjective conditions, and that revolutionaries should have the three virtues of wisdom, benevolence, and courage. The speech concluded with the future path to be taken, which was (1) to promote the New Life Movement, (2) to popularize national education and citizen training, and (3) to strive for national economic construction. The speech was several thousand words long, and the listeners were moved by it. After the speech, the chairman summarized the main points of the speech and made a conclusion, shouting slogans and dispersing.</p>
<p>China National Aviation Corporation</p>
<p>Yesterday was the Premier's birthday. To celebrate, China National Aviation Corporation specially dispatched pilots to fly Stinson trainer aircraft starting at 3:00 PM yesterday and use smoke screens to form the two characters of the Premier's name in the air to express their respect and congratulations. The high altitude yesterday was clear, with little wind and few clouds, so the characters drifted in the sky clearly and beautifully. At that time, many pedestrians on the street stood and craned their necks to watch and praised them endlessly.</p>
<h3>Zhang Shizhao Meets with Reporters, Talks Freely About the Current Situation in the North, Says There Is No Cause for Concern in Hebei, Chahar, Suiyuan, and Eastern Hebei, and Denies That Hebei and Chahar Will Set Up a Supreme Branch Court</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Shizhao, a member of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee and Chairman of the Legal System Committee, flew from Beiping to Shanghai the other day to offer condolences to Mr. Duan Qirui. He is scheduled to stay in Shanghai for a week before returning to the north. Mr. Zhang met with reporters at his residence yesterday afternoon and made the following remarks:</p>
<p>No Cause for Concern in Hebei, Chahar, Suiyuan, and Eastern Hebei</p>
<p>According to Mr. Zhang, the current situation in the north is not as dangerous as people in the south imagine. The situation in Hebei and Chahar is quite stable, although there is a hidden crisis. However, this kind of crisis exists everywhere else in China, and it is difficult to predict when and where it will break out. The rabble of the pseudo-Mongolian bandits invaded eastern Suiyuan. According to my observation, there is definitely no cause for concern, because Chairman Fu (Zuoyi)'s strength is sufficient to eliminate the bandits and more than enough. They will never be allowed to spread.</p>
<p>The Legal System Committee Will Be Reorganized Soon</p>
<p>The Hebei-Chahar Legal System Committee is under the central legal system and discusses the legal system applicable to Hebei and Chahar. In other words, it discusses the single-line laws of Hebei and Chahar. In the past, the position of Chairman of the Legal System Committee was concurrently held by Deng Zhexi, the President of the Hebei Higher Court. Therefore, the Legal System Committee and the court were integrated. As for the future relationship between the Legal System Committee and the court, it remains to be discussed. All committees under the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee will be reorganized. How the Legal System Committee will be reorganized, the number of committee members, and the candidates will all be decided after I return to the north.</p>
<p>No Intention to Set Up a Supreme Branch Court</p>
<p>China has a vast territory and a large population. Therefore, the number of cases accepted by the Supreme Court is extremely large. To date, the number of pending cases is nearly 10,000. Many cases have been pending for a year, and have not yet been processed. Therefore, in theory, it is necessary for the Supreme Court to set up a branch court. However, in fact, the Supreme Court is not allowed to set up a branch court. The prior revocation of the Supreme Branch Courts in the Northeast and Southwest can prove this. The rumors that Hebei and Chahar will set up a Supreme Branch Court are not true. We have never considered this.</p>
<p>Leaving Shanghai in a Week and Returning to the North Soon</p>
<p>I came here specifically to offer condolences to Mr. Duan Zhiquan and have no other mission. I plan to stay for a week and then return to the north.</p>
<h3>Wang Yitang Left Shanghai for Kunshan Yesterday</h3>
<p>Wang Yitang, a member of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, arrived in Shanghai the other day to offer condolences for the death of Duan Qirui. He only stayed in Shanghai for one night and left Shanghai by early express train at 8:00 AM yesterday. It is said that he went to Kunshan for business. It is uncertain whether he will come to Shanghai again or return to the north immediately.</p>
<h3>Song Ziliang Is Still Staying in Shanghai; It Is Not True That He Took a Ship South Yesterday Evening</h3>
<p>Song Ziliang, Special Commissioner of the Guangdong Finance Department and Director of the Finance Department, flew from Guangdong to Shanghai on September 30 to meet with Minister of Finance Kong and report and request instructions on everything. He has been staying in Shanghai for a long time. It is rumored that Mr. Song took a ship south yesterday evening, but this is not true. According to news from the Song residence, Mr. Song will be staying in Shanghai for quite some time.</p>
<h3>One-Day Movement Advocacy Outline; Purchasing a Plane to Celebrate Birthday Conference Sets a Date; Sent to Broadcasting Stations for Promotion</h3>
<p>In order to expand publicity for the aviation-to-save-the-nation, dedicating-a-plane-to-celebrate-birthday one-day movement, a concise outline for official promotion of the one-day movement has been drafted and sent to various broadcasting stations and entertainment venues to be promoted on a daily basis. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>Origin: The donation for a plane to celebrate birthday in this city is expected to be 1 million yuan, enough to purchase 10 planes, organized into the Zhongzheng Team, and presented to the government as a memorial to Chairman Chiang's 50th birthday. As the birthday approached, the donations received amounted to more than 600,000 yuan, far from enough. Mayor Wu negotiated with the central government to have 10 planes flown to Shanghai and named first, with the remaining amount to be collected and paid later. People from all walks of life, hearing this news, rose up to support it, and thus the "One-Day Contribution to the Country Movement" was born. First, Yao Songnian of the Travel Industry Association suggested this to the association, followed by an editorial in the Li Bao newspaper advocating it. Then, at the naming ceremony for the planes dedicated to the country held in this city, Wang Xiaolai, the chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, made a temporary motion, which aroused national attention and sympathy. Now this movement is not only popular throughout Shanghai, but has also spread throughout the country. It can be seen that the people of our country have a desire and understanding of the country.</p>
<p>Significance: The survival, interests, and harm of the country are the survival, interests, and harm of the people of the country. The people must protect their own lives and safety, and must unite their efforts to maintain the entire country and the entire nation so that they are not harmed in any way. However, to achieve this goal, we must first enrich the country's national defense, especially the most important air defense in national defense. We are launching the "One-Day Contribution to the Country Movement" because we see the seriousness of the national crisis and the urgency of foreign aggression. We should do our best to contribute to the country, enrich aviation, consolidate national defense, demonstrate strength, be a diplomatic backing, and fight for national survival. The significance of the one-day movement lies in this.</p>
<p>Method: All fellow citizens in the city should contribute one day's wages to the country. As for companies and shops, it would be good if they could contribute one day's business income to the country. Otherwise, they can take a portion of one day's profit and donate it as they see fit. The date of the donation will be decided or announced in the newspaper, or sent to the association and chamber of commerce for verification, and marked on the shop front for promotion. The donated money can be sent directly to the Eight Immortals Overseas Youth Association, this association, or the Chamber of Commerce and various industry associations, and major newspapers can also be entrusted to collect it.</p>
<p>Slogans: "Contributing to the country for one day" is the minimum sacrifice for the people in extraordinary times. Use the power of one day in the whole country to enrich the national defense, and use the spirit of one day in the whole country to defend the nation. The number of "one day" is not large, but the number of "one day" collected from the whole country is large. The power of one person for one day is not great, but the power of 450 million people in the whole country for one day is great. I hope that fellow citizens will not let go of this "one day" and implement the sacrifice of "this one day." Shanghai Fundraising to Purchase a Plane to Celebrate the Memorial Committee.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Chinese Employees General Association Calls an Emergency Meeting</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Council published the news of the "Staff Economic Committee," all parties have paid close attention to it. It is said that the Chinese employees of the council are particularly fearful. It is now known that the association, in order to protect the rights and interests of all Chinese employees, has scheduled a temporary emergency membership meeting at 5:30 PM today in the auditorium of the Gezhi Public School on Beihai Road to report on and discuss response policies. It is said that the association intends to make proposals regarding the rights and interests that Chinese employees should receive.</p>
<h3>Wei Luko Highly Praises China's Civil Aviation Progress: Wei Returns to the US Regularly</h3>
<p>Mr. Wei Luko, Aviation Commissioner of the British Embassy in China, has been working in Shanghai for three years. He has made many plans for the development of Chinese aviation. He also contributed to the recent arrival of the British airship in Shanghai and the Anglo-American agreement to establish a base for Pan American Airways' Clipper in Hong Kong. He has recently been transferred back to his home country by the British government to serve as a professor at the Imperial Defence College. He will soon depart to take up his new post. A few days ago,</p>
<p>Mr. Wei, accompanied by his successor, Mr. Koubi, visited North China and then Hangzhou. He was very impressed with the progress of Chinese commercial aviation. Mr. Koubi has served at the US Air Force base in Singapore in recent years. Before coming to Shanghai, he inspected the latest British factories and aviation finances and felt that China had made important progress in commercial aviation. Mr. Wei plans to travel to the United States with his wife next Monday on the Canadian Empress, first to Buffalo to visit the Curtiss-Wright aircraft factory, and then to England by boat from New York. Mr. Wei has great hope for the future of Chinese aviation and is concerned that Hong Kong will become an aviation terminus with global connections.</p>

<h3>Liu Wan Returns to Shanghai After Attending the Pacific International Institute, Discussing Details of the Conference and Impressions of the Soviet Union: The Council of the International Institute May Be Held in Shanghai Next Year; The Soviet Union is Committed to the Second Five-Year Plan with Remarkable Results</h3>
<p>According to Shenzhou News Agency, Liu Yuwan, Secretary-General of the Chinese Branch of the Sixth Pacific International Institute, returned to Shanghai on the eighth of this month via Siberia after the conference and after inspecting the eastern United States and various European countries. Yesterday, the reporter of Shenzhou News Agency went to interview him and learned a lot about the inspection process and the real situation of the conference. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>More Than Two Hundred Representatives from Various Countries</p>
<p>According to Mr. Liu, the conference was held in Semite Park, California. Participants included more than 250 representatives from the United Kingdom, the United States, China, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Canada, Australia, and other countries. The Japanese representatives were former Foreign Minister Kijuro Shidehara, Major General Sakaishi, Senator Dr. Yamakawa, important members of the South Manchuria Railway Company Kiyoshi Ii, and scholars Yosuke Tsurumi, Kenzo Takayanagi, and Hiroshi Nasu, etc., a total of sixteen people. The French representative was former Prime Minister Schuman. The United Kingdom promoted former Naval Minister Alexander as the chief representative. China promoted Dr. Hu Shih as the chief representative. The Soviet Union sent Professor Matiev of the Moscow Institute of Economics and Mr. Raum, a TASS reporter stationed in Washington, for the first time this year. The chairman was former US Secretary of the Army Baker.</p>
<p>Important Topics Discussed at the Conference</p>
<p>The conference lasted for two weeks. The general topic of discussion was "The Economic and Social Policy Goals and Impacts of Pacific Countries," which was decided three years ago at the conference held in Canada. Because the United States, China, Japan, and the Soviet Union occupy important positions in the Pacific, the discussion also focused on the above four countries. It can be roughly divided into (1) the impact of China's economic construction on other countries. In addition to the construction of highways, the most important thing is the improvement of China's currency system, which has attracted great attention from various countries. (2) The relationship between the United States' recovery and countries such as Canada, China, and the United Kingdom. The review of the impact of the US silver purchase policy on China is very detailed. (3) The expansion of Japanese trade. Because Japan published a statement in April of the previous year stating that China's economy should be supported by Japan and not allow European and American countries to invest in China, but China has the largest trade and economic relationship with various countries, many representatives questioned it. This meeting gave the participating representatives a special impression of Japan on this issue. (4) The economic development of the Soviet Union, etc.</p>
<p>Important Report by Soviet Representatives</p>
<p>When discussing issues related to the Soviet Union, the Soviet representatives reported on the country's economic plan, which attracted the attention of the entire audience. The representatives gave specific reports on the Soviet Union's economic construction and system, which were different from other countries. Because there is no private operation in international trade, the country's economic system and policies were explained in detail, and it was stated that the Soviet Union has no ambitions in the Pacific, loves peace very much, and is very willing to be friendly with all countries. The Soviet Union's military preparations, etc., are very well-organized, and if any country invades, it will definitely resist. In the last three days, the new balance of international forces in the Pacific and peace strategies were discussed. Because of Japan's ambition and the independence of the Philippines in the past three years, the situation in the Pacific has changed.</p>
<p>Glimpse of Papers by Chinese Representatives</p>
<p>Sixteen Chinese representatives attended the conference. The head of the delegation, Hu Shih, spoke the most and gave a very poignant speech, which was greatly sympathized by various countries. Among the Chinese representatives, those who submitted papers for reading included (1) Fang Hsien-ting, the new trend of China's economic control, (2) Zhang Chunming, rural reconstruction, (3) He Lian, rural construction and China's economy, (4) Ding Jie, China's cotton spinning industry, (5) Lin Weiying, review of China's new currency system, (6) Zhang Zhongfu, Sino-Japanese relations after the Tanggu Agreement, etc.</p>
<p>Council to Be Held in Shanghai Next Year</p>
<p>The conference is held once every three years. The location of the next conference has not yet been decided. The president has been appointed. The new president is Dr. Dafu, a famous Canadian journalist. One of the vice presidents is Hu Shih, and the other is Mr. Wilbur of the United States. At the same time, the meeting decided to hold a council in the Far East next year with representatives and members from eleven member countries. The location will be in Shanghai or Tokyo, Japan, to discuss preparations for the 1939 conference, etc. After that, it was decided to hold a council in each country in rotation every year. The Chinese members are Hu Shih and myself. As for the general topic of discussion for the next conference, it has been decided to be "Political and Economic Factors of Trade Coexistence Between Pacific Countries."</p>
<p>Glimpse of Impressions of Soviet Inspection</p>
<p>Finally, when the reporter asked Mr. Liu about his impressions of inspecting the Soviet Union, he said that after the meeting, he had traveled to New York, Washington, and various places in England, France, and Geneva. On the way back, he passed through the Soviet Union and stayed for four days. He was warmly received and visited by the local branch. He felt a lot during his short stay in the Soviet Union. In general, although the situation in the Soviet Union seems to be better on the surface, it is still far from capitalist countries. Whether it is clothing, food, housing, or transportation, it is not comparable to England, the United States, France, and Belgium. However, the current state of its economic policies should be discussed separately. The people of the country work mainly on the premise that it is truly related to national and people's welfare. The first five-year plan was entirely focused on developing heavy industry, and the second phase began to pay attention to light industry. The people pay attention to every piece of clothing and every sock, which shows its greatness. What is noteworthy is: (1) The current Soviet-made new cars, airplanes, etc. are all self-made. (2) Moscow recently laid a subway, which has now completed a section, but it is even more beautiful than those in New York and Paris. (3) Ninety-five percent of the materials for the completion of its subway are all domestically produced. (4) Currently, there are no British or American cigarettes or French cigarettes in Moscow. (5) Moscow has five million people, but the transportation facilities are only enough for two million people, so it is actively working on transportation construction. Mr. Liu said at the end that this time he, his wife Shi Jiguang of the Four Lines Savings Society, and Mr. Shen Kunshan of the Yizhong Tobacco Company returned to China via Siberia through the Soviet Union. After arriving in Manchukuo, they were often checked by the Manchukuo military and police, which was very troublesome. They were detained overnight at Shanhaiguan because of the inspection. He was quite sad when he said this.</p>

<h3>Liu Zhen Went to Hangzhou Yesterday</h3>
<p>Mr. Liu Zhenhuan was originally summoned to the north to ask Chairman Chiang for instructions on everything. Later, he received a telegram from Chairman Chiang from Luoyang, asking him to invite him again after returning to Nanjing. Liu felt that he was too busy with social activities and was very tired, so he took advantage of the autumn weather to go to Hangzhou for sightseeing and rest. He left Shanghai by car yesterday afternoon.</p>
<h3>China Silk Exports Are Smooth, But Unfortunately Raw Materials Are Lacking, and Many Factories Are Shutting Down</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of autumn, China silk exports have been smooth and prices have risen sharply. Recently, the price of standard China silk with 20 to 22 stripes in the foreign market has risen to 750 yuan in national currency. Foreign firms such as Dachang in this city have purchased large quantities, so exports have increased sharply, and the stock of silk in the market is decreasing day by day. Because of the lack of raw materials, many silk factories are unable to start work, including Yuanji, Yuanxing, Shaoxing, Hengtai, and Fuchang No. 2 factories. The silk factories that are currently maintaining work will also shut down one after another. The raw materials of each factory can only last until the end of the year at most, so the prices of China silk are expected to rise uniformly. Due to the dry autumn weather in Zhejiang Province, the harvest of late autumn cocoons has decreased, and the firms have now stopped weighing. The Zhejiang Provincial Sericulture Control Committee and the Jiangsu Provincial Sericulture Improvement Committee have now begun to prepare seeds for the spring silkworms next year and will distribute them to farmers in various places for incubation.</p>
<h3>Workers in Various Factories Firmly Strike; Shanghai's Attempts to Resume Work Fail; Workers at the Gongda Factory Continue to Work at Night After the Day Shift Strikes; The Factory Promises to Respond to the Five Demands This Morning; The Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Sino-Japanese Trade Association Conduct Mediation</h3>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency, since the joint strike wave occurred in Japanese-owned yarn factories in Shanghai, the central government has attached great importance to it. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce sent personnel to Shanghai to discuss solutions with the municipal government. Qian Xinzhi, chairman of the Sino-Japanese Trade Association, visited Mr. Funatsu, chairman of the Japanese Yarn Factory Association, again yesterday to conduct side-by-side consultations. The various striking yarn factories failed to resume work last night, and various factories such as Nei Wai Cotton in the Hongqiao area also have unstable actions. The details of each situation are as follows:</p>
<p>Ministry of Industry and Commerce Sends Personnel to Shanghai to Discuss</p>

The situation is becoming increasingly serious. The central authorities are very concerned about this labor unrest.

Recognizing this, the Chamber of Commerce and the Accountant have jointly organized an income tax seminar. In addition to public lectures and joint research, we have specially formulated a summary, solicited members, and held seminars. We plan to explain in detail the principles and history of income tax, and the types of taxes, tax amount calculation, tax procedures, and tax payment methods in our country's current system. We will also provide clear guidance on accounting issues related to income tax, such as the calculation of capital and public reserves, the verification of income and expenditure and net profit, the valuation of various assets, and accounting management and bookkeeping improvements. We aim to complete the seminar in six weeks so that our industrial and commercial community can have a thorough understanding of income tax and be adequately prepared. This will undoubtedly be beneficial.</p>

<h3>Traffic Lights Intentionally Making Things Difficult for Chartered Cars; Department Responsible for Operation Bears Responsibility</h3>
<p>The intersection of Zhejiang Road and Beijing Road in the Public Concession is a prosperous area in the central district. The Public Works Department has installed traffic lights at the intersection, with officers specifically assigned to operate them and direct traffic. Yesterday (the 12th) around 8:00 AM, during the peak time for Chinese and Westerners going to their offices, there was a constant flow of cars. A chartered car with license plate number 6580, seeing that the green light was on, proceeded from east to west. Unexpectedly, while in the middle of the intersection, the green light turned off and the red light turned on. The driver was in a dilemma, unable to move forward or backward. He hurriedly turned south, but was stopped by Chinese officer number 1000, who accused him of violating the regulations. The officer pulled at the car's canvas top and pried off its chartered car permit. The driver refused to comply and argued with the officer, leading to a dispute. The white armband on the officer's arm was torn off. The officer immediately detained the driver, accusing him of damaging his uniform and obstructing his duties. The driver continued to argue and was beaten. The officer then took the driver and the car to the police station for investigation.</p>

<h3>Gangsters Extort 200 Gold; Claiming to be Good Samaritans Passing Through; Hardware Store Owner Wang Reports to the Police; Gangsters Arrive to Collect the Money and are Apprehended</h3>
<p>Shen Quanbing, the owner of Xie Changxiang Hardware and Glass Store at 328 East-West Huade Road, received a threatening letter delivered by gangsters the morning before yesterday at 7:00 AM. The letter claimed that the senders were good samaritans passing through Shanghai on their way home. They claimed to be short of funds for their return and, hearing that Shen was wealthy, requested a loan of 200 yuan in twenty ten-yuan bills. The letter instructed Shen to hide the bills in a large envelope in the third gap of the stacked wooden door panels in front of the store. The letter threatened to set the store on fire if the money was not there to be collected at 8:00 PM. After receiving the letter, Shen was extremely alarmed and reported the situation to the Hongkou Police Station, presenting the letter as evidence. At the appointed time, Chinese detective Liu Zhaonian, along with detectives Zhang Xishan and Huang Yulin, disguised as merchants, kept watch near the store. Meanwhile, Shen's store clerk, Zhang Shunqing, kept watch from the balcony. After some time, a Cantonese man named Guo Sen arrived, pretended to urinate, and checked the door panels. He then took the envelope and fled. Detective Liu and others immediately stepped forward to arrest him and took him to the police station. The next morning, he was escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The Public Works Department lawyer, Zhang Shizhu, presented the case and stated that the defendant had not confessed at the police station and requested a postponement. Detective Liu then reported the circumstances of the arrest and presented the evidence. When questioned, the defendant claimed that he was passing by the area and saw an envelope, so he picked it up to look at it and knew nothing else. Judge Xiao ordered him to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing to investigate further.</p>
<h3>Brothers Induce and Rape Sister-in-Law; Sentenced to Ten Months in Prison</h3>
<p>Chen Ni, the wife of Chen Jinrong, a native of Shaoxing who runs a coal shop on Zhong Yu Road, Zhabei, had an affair with Chen Jinwen, her husband's brother who works at a gold exchange, because her husband was unemployed and she could not bear a simple life. She hired a lawyer to divorce her husband so that she could marry her brother-in-law. Chen Jinrong caught them in the act at the Central Apartments and brought them to the District Court. After investigation by the prosecutor, it was found that Chen Jinwen had sent a love letter to his sister-in-law, and his enticement and disruption of the family were evident in writing. Chen Jinwen was charged with inducement and adultery, and Chen Ni was also charged with adultery. During questioning by Judge Wu Xiangzu, Chen Ni claimed that a clerk named Shi Jiwan from lawyer Zhang Baotang's office introduced the lawyer to the Central Apartments and also sent someone to deliver the divorce papers. Chen Jinwen claimed that he was only there to persuade his sister-in-law to return home. The judge found that the handwriting on the love letter matched Chen Jinwen's, and there was no way to deny it. However, Chen Jinrong, the husband, pleaded in court to withdraw the charges due to his parents' wishes. The judge ruled that while adultery could be withdrawn, the inducement charges could not. The defendant's lawyer, Zhang Baotang, requested probation or bail, but the prosecutor argued that the brother-in-law's inducement and rape of his sister-in-law could not be tolerated and requested that the lawyer's request be rejected. The judge then declared the debate closed, released Chen Ni on bail to return to her husband, and ordered Chen Jinwen to remain in custody pending judgment. Yesterday, Judge Wu Xiangzu opened the court and sentenced Chen Jinwen to ten months in prison for inducing a married woman. As for the adultery charges, since the plaintiff withdrew them, they were dismissed. After the judgment was announced, Chen Jinwen was remanded in custody pending the appeal period, after which he would be sent to prison.</p>

<h3>Leather Goods Association Ceases Activities</h3>
<p>The Jin Fu Yuan and other leather goods factories in this city received a notification from the Social Affairs Bureau, Hai Zi No. 1294, yesterday, stating that since Chen Jiufeng and others no longer have factories operating, their qualifications as member representatives and committee members should be revoked in accordance with the law. Furthermore, since the association's application for record has exceeded the statutory time limit and it has not yet applied to the bureau for registration in accordance with the law, its internal organization is seriously lacking. It should cease activities immediately and wait for the city party headquarters to send personnel to reorganize it. Since these factories are colleagues in the leather goods industry, they should all join the Leather Goods Association as members, and there is no need to form another group to avoid fragmentation. In addition to ordering the Leather Goods Association to comply, a letter will be sent to the city party headquarters to send personnel to reorganize it. You are hereby notified.</p>
<h3>Deep Love; Landlord is Accused Instead</h3>
<p>Cui Zhongfa, a resident of 183 Lane, Hui Ning Road in this city, makes a living by pulling a rickshaw. His wife, He, is somewhat attractive and promiscuous. Recently, she has fallen in love with Wu Zongshan, a friend of her husband's, and has been having an affair. One night, Wu came to Cui's house again for a secret rendezvous. It was already late at night, and he pushed open the door and entered. Wang San, a rickshaw puller who lived with them, saw this and questioned his identity. They disagreed and Wu punched him. A continuous dispute ensued. Wu Shouhai, the second landlord of the place, was awakened by the noise and called the police. They dispersed the crowd. Wu Zhongshan threw down his uniform and hat and left. The next day, he became angry out of shame and filed a complaint with the District Court, accusing the first landlord Wu Shouhai of assault and fraud. After questioning yesterday, the official ruled that the case still needed investigation and rescheduled the hearing. (Xinmin News Agency)</p>

<h3>Funeral Preparations at Duan's Residence; Reduced Expenses Discussed Yesterday</h3>
<p>Contacting the Ministry of Railways to arrange for the transportation of the coffin and family members to Beijing in the coming days to prepare for the funeral. Duan Qirui's funeral preparations, with expenses estimated at 20,000 yuan donated by President Jiang and 10,000 yuan subsidized by the central government, but the daily expenses have reached 500 yuan.

<h3>Fishing Piles and Discoloration Cases; Ministry of Finance Replies with Explanation</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association, in response to the fishing salt stacking and discoloration cases in Daishan, which affected the livelihood of fishermen, telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to order a flexible solution. It is now reported that the association received a reply from the Ministry of Finance, No. 5418, yesterday, stating that since the Daishan incident, the Ministry has received various reports from public groups on the difficulties faced by local salt fishermen. It has ordered the Liangzhe Transportation Envoy to conduct a detailed investigation and, if there are any inconveniences to the people, to find ways to improve the situation. Based on the various circumstances reported by Liu Linzhao and others, representatives of the salt fishermen in Daishan, a detailed review has been conducted and is hereby clearly indicated below. The construction of salt piles is an important policy for reorganizing the salt production areas nationwide. The implementation of the new salt law is imminent, and the fundamental construction of salt production areas is being actively carried out in all regions. Daishan is an important salt production area in Zhejiang, and preparations have only just begun, which is already late and cannot be delayed any further. However, the previous use of mud land for salt production and the restriction of salt pile time seem to be inconvenient for the people. The Liangzhe Transportation Envoy has been ordered to reply, and the engineering office is trying its best to avoid salt fields when building salt piles. The opening of salt piles can also be flexibly changed to avoid hindering the work of salt fishermen in terms of location and time. Therefore, the previous difficulties have been eliminated. As for the heavy cost of finished salt, improvements should be made to the salt industry itself, which has nothing to do with salt pile construction. This is not a problem. This means that the construction of salt piles cannot be delayed and that the handling is not hindered. Since the government has specially reduced the tax rate on salt used for fishing to facilitate competition with foreigners, it is necessary to prevent the mixing of heavily taxed edible salt, which would result in a loss of national revenue. Therefore, there are regulations on changing the taste and color of salt used for fishing. However, the methods of discoloration vary from place to place. The Ministry has jointly established a fishing salt experiment area with the Ministry of Industry to specialize in researching and implementing methods to ensure that the measures are appropriate. The discoloration of fishing salt in the Daishan area is still in the trial stage. How to improve it in the future, strive for convenience, or formulate strict measures to eliminate discoloration procedures is still under evaluation and discussion. This means that the measures for discoloring fishing salt are still under consideration. In addition to instructing the Liangzhe Transportation Envoy, this electricity report is hereby sent for immediate notification, hoping that it will be forwarded to the salt fisherman representatives to be informed.</p>

<p>Continuation of Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Dynamics in July and August</p>
<p>(Continuation) (Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Overview, Part 8) China Zheng, Editor</p>
<p>(4) Opening of Shengsheng Trust Company</p>
<p>This bank was initiated by the Jinye tycoon Lin Bingyan, and is a limited company with a capital of one million yuan. It specializes in trust and banking business. The chairman of the board is Mr. Lin Bingyan, and He Shanheng and Chen Zhenxia serve as general manager and manager. It opened in the middle of the month on the 6th.</p>
<p>Regarding news publishing and intermediary industries, there are:</p>
<p>American Huamei Publishing Company Opens</p>
<p>This company was initiated by a group of colleagues from the former Damei Evening News, and is a limited company organized, registered by the US government and filed with the US Consulate General in Shanghai. It first published the Chinese Huamei Evening News, and plans to engage in other publishing businesses. It has a grand scale and new printing machines.</p>
<p>(2) Shanghai Flour Exchange Increases Capital</p>
<p>The original capital of the exchange was 750,000 national currency. This time, the shareholder Santaihao proposed to increase the capital by 250,000 yuan, making a total of one million yuan, in order to consolidate the foundation. The shareholders' meeting unanimously approved the share offering.</p>
<p>(3) Shanghai Coal Industry Public Warehouse Liquidation</p>
<p>The warehouse was established in the Republic of China thirteen years ago, with a capital of 110,000 yuan, and is a limited liability company organized. The manager is Mr. Wei Hongwen, specializing in the preparation of head stacks. In recent years, due to the impact of the depression and competition from the same industry, prices have gradually fallen, and business has declined. Recently, the shareholders' meeting decided on the 8th of this month to dissolve the company and carry out liquidation. At the same time, the coal warehouse base, wharf and all buildings were sold to China Coal Mine Company.</p>
<p>The number of new manufacturing industries in July increased by one compared to the previous month, and the number of closures decreased by ten compared to the previous month, which is much better than the previous month. The more important ones include the following:</p>
<p>(1) Restructuring of the Zhonghua Steel Factory</p>
<p>Founded in March of the 22nd year, with a capital of 110,000 national currency, it is a partnership organization. The shareholder Bao Heqing serves as the manager, employing twenty to thirty workers, specializing in the manufacture of various kinds of strips. The factory's raw materials mainly come from old ship scrap iron and other materials. Recently, due to Japanese competition to purchase scrap ships, and because the Chinese Customs charges a tax on the demolition of old ships, the raw materials are sometimes in short supply, and the market is sluggish and sales are declining, and business is gradually declining. On the 1st of this month, the factory suddenly announced its dissolution, and at the same time sold all the machinery and factory buildings to the British China Steel Factory Co., Ltd. to continue operations.</p>
<p>(2) Huachang Match Splint Company Reduces Capital</p>
<p>The company was established in January of the 22nd year, that is, it was reorganized from the former Huachang Heji and Huachang Xinji, with a capital of 200,000 national currency. The directors are Zhu Ziqian and Xu Zhihui, etc., and Wang Yihe is hired as the manager; in the past, business was difficult to make a profit due to the impact of foreign goods dumping. In August of the 24th year, a labor dispute occurred again, and it was impossible to make ends meet, and liquidation was announced. Until September of the same year, the labor and management reached an agreement through the mediation of the Social Bureau, and considerable planning was done in the economic aspect, and the liquidation was terminated. On October 15th, a trial resumption of business was carried out; however, since the start of work, business has not improved, so the shareholders' meeting decided to reduce the original capital to 140,000 yuan, in order to reduce the scope and lighten the burden.</p>
<p>(3) Asia Soap Products Company Sells Out</p>
<p>The company was founded in the Republic of China 21 years ago, initiated by Mr. Li Xingchu. At the beginning, it was originally planned to raise 10,000 yuan to build a factory building, but because the situation was unstable at that time, it was difficult to raise shares, so only 10,000 yuan was raised before starting business. The company adopted a limited liability company organization, with Mr. Li serving as the manager; since the opening, business was initially booming, but due to soaring raw material prices and plummeting prices, profits were minimal: in recent years, although raw material prices have gradually fallen, the market is sluggish and sales are slow, so the shareholders have no intention of operating, and all movable property has been sold to Asia Xingji Soap Factory for operation.</p>
<p>(4) Huabi Tobacco Company Closes</p>
<p>The company was founded around the tenth year of the Republic of China, with a capital of 200,000 national currency, and is a joint-stock company organized. Mr. Weng Haiqing served as the general manager, employing 300 to 400 workers. At the beginning, the business was not very developed. By the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, the shipowner brand cigarettes produced by the company were very popular, so the scope was expanded and the factory building was purchased. However, not long after, the business fell sharply due to excessive competition among peers. Since the 22nd year, the company's own brand cigarettes have almost completely stopped production, and all the machines are specially used for Wadah Company to roll cigarettes on behalf of the company. Since then, economic turnover has become increasingly tight, and the company had no choice but to mortgage all the machines to Dahshang Bank. Recently, Dahshang Bank enforced the mortgage and auctioned off the mortgaged property to repay the debt. At the same time, the landlord also filed a lawsuit for rent arrears, and the tax bureau also ordered the company to stop business and cancel its operating rights, so it was impossible to maintain it.</p>

<p>Sports News</p>
<p>When Tilden Vances Comes to Shanghai for the Second Time</p>
<p>Amateur Players Cannot Participate in Guidance Matches</p>
<p>Local Netball Player Carter and Others Rejected by the Grass Court Association</p>
<p>The Organization of China Netball Association Cannot Be Delayed</p>
<p>Since world professional tennis players Tilden and Vances came to Shanghai to demonstrate their skills, enthusiastic tennis fans in Beijing and Shanghai have contacted Mr. McCarty, the manager of the Dalei Company, the agents of Tilden and others in Shanghai, to invite them to perform another game each in Beijing and Shanghai after the final performance on the 20th, and then return home on the mail ship that departs on the 24th. The details were published in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the results of the negotiations with McCarty in the past few days have been completely disappointing. The reason given by Mr. McCarty is that Tilden and others signed a contract with Hollywood's MGM and Paramount film companies before leaving the United States, and must start filming before December 15th in order to be released before Christmas, so they must take the Lincoln wheel to arrive on time, etc. However, there is still a glimmer of hope, that is, Mr. Qian once agreed by telegram, but his reply has not yet been received. If Mr. Tilden's reply also refuses, then we will not be able to enjoy Mr. Tilden's skills for the third time. Only Mr. Vance said that when he forms a team to come to China in the spring and summer of next year, he can see Vance's art again. The contract for Vance's performance in China next year can be signed in advance before Vance and others return home on the 20th. In addition, Mr. Chen Qihao, who is enthusiastic about tennis, also contacted his agent yesterday and yesterday, and intended to invite Tilden and others to match up with local foreign masters Carson Defu and Chinese successors Cai Huiquan, Yu Tianguang, Ma Shaobo, Tu Kaiyuan, and Zhou Guanjun in the third and fourth performances, respectively, to correct their hitting methods and imitate Tilden's so-called "guidance" performance in Japan with Yamagishi and others, so as to avoid the incompatibility between amateur and professional players. Yesterday, Carson came forward to discuss a compromise with the local lawn tennis association, but failed to reach an understanding. Chen also cited the duel between Japanese player Yamagishi and the fact that when Ke Xian came to Hong Kong last year, the local grass court association also allowed the Lin Zhen brothers and Chinese youth master Cai Weipei to openly attend the ticketed competition. Although the British authorities opposed this move and sent a letter to condemn it, it was not heard that they exercised their sanctions in the end, which shows that guidance is helpful in improving the level of tennis and is beneficial to players, and it seems that it can be handled with discretion, but it was finally rejected by the local grass court association. Chen was heartbroken by this incident and once again expressed his desire to organize the "China National Tennis Association", and has invited tennis experts to dine at the New Asia Hotel this afternoon to discuss this issue.</p>
<p>China Football Club Holds Committee Meeting Tonight</p>
<p>Qian Dui Jianmin Changed to Saturday</p>
<p>The China Football Club Committee is scheduled to hold a meeting at the Dengtuomo Hotel on Ningbo Road at 6:00 PM tonight to discuss all important matters related to the club's affairs. Members Jiang Xiangqing, Le Xiurong, He Chunhui, Ma Detai, and Rong Qizhao are all expected to attend to discuss the progress together. In addition, the ball team's Shuang Qian Dui Jianmin game, originally scheduled to be held on Sunday (15th) of this week, has now been changed to Saturday (14th) afternoon at 3:00 PM at the Great China Stadium. The game between the club team's Public Security Huainan has been postponed.</p>
<p>Football Friendship Match</p>
<p>Xuhui vs. Zhendan</p>
<p>1-3 Xuhui Teachers and Students Lose</p>
<p>Xuhui Public School in Xujiahui has a long history, teaches conscientiously, and strives for development in sports. Yesterday was the anniversary of the death of the Premier. In order to observe the skills of the game, the school specially invited the football team of the Medical College of Zhendan University in this city to play a friendly match at the school's stadium yesterday morning. After an hour and twenty minutes of fierce fighting, the Zhendan team won 3-1. Zhendan's forwards were sharp, such as Zhang Susheng, Hualai, and Cai Zhenyan, and their performances were excellent, but they lacked contact, so they lost many opportunities. The Xuhui team's defense was very stable, repeatedly saving dangerous balls, which was appreciated by the audience. All five forwards were teachers and staff of the school, who were able to contact and pass directly, and the momentum was like a bamboo, but because Zhendan's defender Chen Yuwen, and Yan Er Ju Kefu, Wei Bei Sen, intercepted the ball before the goal, the victory belonged to Zhendan.</p>
<p>Billiard Competition to Begin Soon</p>
<p>Many National Masters Join the Senior Group</p>
<p>It is reported that this year's Shanghai billiards competition at all levels will begin on the 16th of this month. The participants are very enthusiastic. The team championship is still expected to be won by the Portuguese General Assembly. The only team that can compete with the Portuguese team is the Chinese Youth Association, followed by the International General Assembly.</p>
<p>In the senior group of the singles competition, it has not been seen that the billiard king Li Gongying will participate in this year's competition. Therefore, this year's championship will most likely be won by the defending champion, Portuguese master Medina. The Englishman Clark also has considerable qualifications.</p>
<p>Many national masters have joined the senior group of the singles competition, and the interest has not been reduced due to Li Gongying's absence. However, Li's participation would make the competition even more enthusiastic. Zhang Yingda, the runner-up in the previous competition, should have greater hopes this time. The Wu brothers are also veterans in the field. The elder brother uses his left hand, and his stability is extraordinary, and his control over the red ball is especially good. Ding Mingyi, a key member of the Chinese team in last year's international championships, is now performing better than in previous years and has the possibility of defeating Zhang Yingda. Zhu Qiliang was the champion of Group B in the previous competition and has been promoted to Group A this time and should have a better performance.</p>
<p>In addition, Ba Kou, Kai Ying, Qi Xu Mu, and Nie Ge Er and other four famous players will join the senior group. The primary is mostly Westerners, and the champion is most likely to be Chinese Bao Jun. It is found that Bao Jun was the runner-up in the previous competition.</p>
<p>Billiards has become a popular sport in Shanghai. All general assemblies, clubs, major hotels, and public institutions have billiards tables, which are the most elegant indoor entertainment. Therefore, there are many people who enjoy this, and the interest in each competition is also increasing year by year.</p>

<p>Donghua and Fudan</p>
<p>Result: 2-2</p>
<p>In order to practice their skills, the Donghua Football Club yesterday played a friendly match with the strong Fudan University team at the school's stadium. Donghua's A and B team players took turns to play. Fudan's strength was exceptionally sharp. Team members such as An Lesheng, Yang Jinling, Liu Zurong, Li Changchi, and Zhu Wenzhang were all veterans with many years of experience, and their offense and defense were extraordinary. Donghua's defense was also as solid as a rock. As a result of the fierce battle in the first half, neither side gained anything. After the break, Donghua changed to an offensive formation, with Gu Shangdong and Feng Yunyou being transferred to the front line, and Tang Shen withdrawing for rest. Gu Feng's defense was replaced by the new force Jin Shu. The front and back were connected, and the momentum was greatly strengthened. After several rounds, Jia Liliang first scored, but due to a momentary negligence, Fudan's center and right forwards Hu Zongxian and Liu Zurong scored two goals in a row, leading 2-1. Donghua was determined to make progress, and Gu Shangdong made another contribution, ending the game in a 2-2 draw.</p>

<p>The End of the City Stadium Small Ball Competition</p>
<p>Discovery of False Claims of Deposits</p>
<p>The 11th small football competition of the City No. 1 Sports Ground ended on the 8th of this month. The deposits of each team were also returned starting on the 8th. Most of the teams have already taken them back. The few teams that have not taken them back are also expected to bring the original receipts to collect them within a week.</p>
<p>It is reported that the 66 Flying Bear Two Small Football Teams, which participated in the conference, previously declared by the cadre Ni Ciyao that the deposit receipts of the two teams had been lost. Anyone who comes to collect the money with these receipts is requested to stop the payment immediately. Yesterday, Ni Shiyao came to the stadium again, holding a letter printed with the emblems of the 66 Flying Bear Two Small Football Teams, stating that the original receipt was lost and specially submitted a letter with the team's seals to collect the deposit of ten yuan. The association immediately paid according to the letter, as Mr. Ni had declared it in advance and had the team's seals as evidence. However, not long after, Xu Guorong, the organizer of the 66 Flying Bear Two Small Football Teams, instructed team member Gui to bring the original receipt to collect the deposit. The association immediately showed Mr. Ni's letter. Mr. Gui said that there was no such thing as losing the receipt, and Mr. Ni was suspected of falsely claiming the deposit. Therefore, the association deeply hopes that Mr. Ni will settle this matter with Xu Guorong as soon as possible to restore his reputation.</p>

<p>The Road to Health   Edited by the Kangjian Medical Society A Strange Exploration of Gonorrhea with Internal and External Treatment - Self-Treatment for Gonorrhea Patients by Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Russian Labor Medical University   Regardless of whether it is men or women, gonorrhea requires not only blood purification and detoxification but also washing the affected area with special medicinal fluids to remove turbidity and drain pus.</p>
<p>Human thought is constantly progressing, and cultural development is becoming increasingly rapid. In medical terms, today's gonorrhea treatment is constantly being updated and can be said to have progressed to the most complete stage. Its perfection is unparalleled, and the stability of the treatment is impeccable! The anti-toxin and antibody therapy for gonorrhea is undeniably effective. Moreover, the application of this therapy as an internal preparation makes self-treatment extremely simple for patients. The anti-toxin and antibody theory is the most authoritative theory based on gonorrhea research.</p>
<p>This theory has been repeatedly tested throughout Europe. For example, the famous gonorrhea scholar E. Franke and venereology expert Dr. Romer have repeatedly conducted animal experiments, all of which have confirmed its value. It has also been proven that besides protein lipid juice having the special effect of enhancing human anti-toxin and antibody production, there is no other way to treat gonorrhea. Therefore, by preparing yellow pigment with protein, the highly effective anti-gonorrhea drug "Kelinong" was successfully invented. I, Yu, heard of the name "Kelinong" when I was at the Moscow Labor Medical University in Russia. After returning to China, I repeatedly used "Kelinong" to treat testicular inflammation with swelling in men's scrotum, seminal emission with blood in prostatitis, and all acute and chronic gonorrhea, all with special efficacy. For women's hidden ailments, taking "Kelinong" can fundamentally eradicate gonorrhea toxins in the blood and eliminate gonococci. Externally, inserting one or two "Kaerxuedi" vaginal tablets into the body every night before going to bed can cleanse leucorrhea and restore reproductive function! However, although gonorrhea has the special internal treatment method of "Kelinong", additional procedures are necessary for extra-fast results. Previously, these procedures had to be performed by a gonorrhea doctor, but now, with the advancement of methods, they can be performed by oneself.</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a new invention, "Anti-Gonococcio Aqva," which only requires washing the urethra or vagina according to the instructions to drain pus and turbidity.</p>
<h3>The Sorrow of Marriage: The Bitter Path of Husband and Wife   By Dr. Chen Minbo, Graduate of the Japanese Imperial Medical University   Overcoming the Obstacles that Divide the Sexes—Sexual Weakness - Achieving Love and Restoring Healthy Sexual Function</h3>
<p>The union of the sexes is not entirely built on money, nor on false ceremonies, but on healthy sexual desire. However, we often see many vain men and women who are sometimes tempted by money or deceived by outward appearances and get married hastily. Such marriages, which gamble with fate, truly send countless young men and women to their graves! How should we prevent this? And how should men and women who have already married remedy it? I think every modern young person should know these questions.</p>
<p>Whenever a couple unites, if either party discovers that their sexual function is unsound, they should seek medical treatment as soon as possible. However, we often see men with venereal diseases, such as those who ruin their puberty glands and damage their sexual nerves through masturbation during adolescence, resulting in underdeveloped lower bodies, seminal emission, lack of sperm, prostatic leakage, inability to achieve erection, and seminal emission upon seeing sexual images during the day. Even if these young men marry reluctantly, they will not satisfy their partners and may even be scorned. The union of the sexes is originally for procreation and love. Now, because one party is ill, the other suffers great losses both mentally and physically, sacrificing their precious and limited youth. Therefore, both men and women feel the sorrow of marriage. Such a path for husband and wife is truly bitter! The German Calolingians said that various symptoms occur when the sexual glands of young people are damaged by masturbation and excessive lust. Taking "Butibody Kang" is most effective. Since I graduated from the Medical Department of the Japanese Imperial University and returned to China to practice medicine, I have prescribed "Butibody Kang" to young people who are dissatisfied with their sex lives after marriage. Within a short period, the blood circulation in the body is improved, transporting nutrients to all parts and providing the hormones lacking in the puberty glands. As a result, the diseased state is removed, and the sexual function is restored. Then love is restored, and a proper and sweet sexual life between the sexes is achieved, and fertility is restored. However, for those with seminal emission, "Naires Seminal Emission Tablets" can be taken together to strengthen the seminal gate and treat seminal emission.</p>
<h3>Prerequisites for Treating Lung Disease - By Dr. Song Zhongyu, Graduate of the Army Medical University   Winter is the Best Time for Treating Lung Disease...Do Not Miss This Opportunity - Indicating a Correct Path for Tuberculosis Patients...Seeking Complete Elimination of Tuberculosis Bacteria</h3>
<p>Because of the suffering of lung disease, I cannot remain silent. Based on my research experience of over twenty years, I want to seek a path of self-reliance and renewal for lung disease sufferers. As is generally known, tuberculosis bacteria exist inside the lungs, surrounded by connective tissue. This tissue is the body's natural defense mechanism, which can limit the activity of tuberculosis bacteria.</p>
<p>However, if this defense organization is not strong, it is often at risk of rupture due to decreased physical strength or lung respiratory shock. And lung disease patients who have been trapped by the disease for a long time are certainly very weak. Therefore, the cure of lung disease is extremely difficult.</p>
<p>Currently, lung surgery and physical therapy, which are prevalent in the treatment community, are based on the same principle: compressing the lungs so that the connective tissue tightly surrounds the tuberculosis lesion, preventing it from rupturing due to lung expansion. The effect is indeed very certain.</p>
<p>What about drug therapy for lung disease?</p>
<p>Drug therapy is also quite effective for lung disease. In today's lung sanatoriums, for patients who do not undergo surgical treatment, doctors mostly try to improve their physical strength and reduce their various symptoms during long-term rest. Achieving this goal relies on internal medicine or injections. Even patients who have undergone surgery (such as rib resection or air injection) need drug treatment. For example, taking calcium and expectorant, cough suppressant, or hemostatic drugs can help speed up the healing of lung disease, as proven by facts.</p>
<p>Currently, "Bufei Naier" is the most reliable new oral medicine for lung disease. This medicine includes the strengths of calcium and cod liver oil and has no side effects. Therefore, coughing and hemoptysis stop immediately after taking it. Moreover, sputum is diluted, and appetite is increased. Night sweats are also suddenly stopped! If you also suffer from neurasthenia, seminal emission, or insomnia, taking "Butibody Kang" for men or "Bu Nv Rong" for women will have a more significant effect.</p>
<h3>Menstrual Disorders and Breast Atrophy - By Dr. Wu Zhonglin, Graduate of Nantong Medical University   ...A woman who does not qualify as a good wife and mother is a disgrace to women. ...Menstrual disorders and intestinal atrophy are all erosions of women's health and beauty and pain throughout the body.</h3>
<p>The reason why women are women and the reason why women bear great responsibilities in humanity is menstruation and the breasts, which are related to menstruation. One is an important reproductive organ, and the other is an important breeding organ. It can be said to be the birthplace of humanity. We should protect it carefully. However, because of congenital underdevelopment and acquired arbitrary destruction of gonadal function, normal development is lost. For example, a lack of ovarian hormone often causes irregular menstruation, and because of gonadal underdevelopment, the breasts cannot be as high as those of healthy women. Women with such symptoms are mostly mentally depressed, neurasthenic, melancholic, and easily angered, becoming eccentric loners, so they often lose favor in the family and are abandoned by their husbands.</p>
<p>Needless to say, such women have lost the qualifications of a good wife and mother. It is indeed a disgrace to women. But how should we save her? Regarding this issue, after graduating from Nantong University Medical School, I used "Bu Nv Rong" to treat thousands of women with menstrual disorders, breast atrophy, and infertility after prolonged marriage. This medicine has been widely noticed and used by women in Berlin, Germany because it—"Bu Nv Rong"—has a strong ovarian function and promotes the development of puberty glands and breasts. Therefore, it quickly eliminates the above symptoms. However, if you suffer from leucorrhea, you can use "Kaerxuedi vaginal tablets" externally as suppositories to remove leucorrhea.</p>
<h3>Crisis and Self-Help for Leucorrhea - By Dr. Chen Shaohua</h3>
<p>Leucorrhea is a very common symptom in women's diseases. Women often take it lightly because of the saying that "nine out of ten women have leucorrhea", resulting in various complications. There are bacilli in the vagina that can consume foreign bacteria, but due to leucorrhea, these bacilli that protect the health of the vagina are killed. Therefore, foreign bacteria take the opportunity to invade, destroying the healthy tissues of the vagina and then invading the uterus and ovaries, causing bleeding in various parts. Or, because of the invasion of these bacteria, it becomes toxic leucorrhea, which can immediately cause blindness if it accidentally infects the eyes. Also, because of its high toxicity, it causes infertility. The treatment method is to use "Kaerxuedi vaginal tablets" externally as suppositories to sweep away leucorrhea and at the same time increase the number of bacilli to kill foreign bacteria. Therefore, whether it is new or old leucorrhea, this tablet can be used as a suppository. Not only does it kill bacteria, but it also eliminates inflammation, prevents corrosion, and stops secretions. Its effectiveness is far beyond that of ordinary medicines. However, for those caused by gonorrhea, "Kelinong" can be taken. For those caused by menstruation or physical weakness, "Bu Nv Rong" can be taken at the same time, so that both aspects can be taken care of.</p>
<h3>Gonococcal Posterior Urethritis Swelling - By Dr. Yao Yaoyan</h3>
<p>The patient, Mr. Shen Fufang, is 23 years old. After suffering from gonorrhea, he continued to drink alcohol, so the condition suddenly changed, and urination was extremely difficult. The turbid fluid secreted was mixed with blood stars, and the gonorrhea threads floated on the surface of the urine like flocs. Although the swelling and pain of the glans and foreskin have subsided, their shape has not yet returned to normal. There is referred pain in the perineum and anus. He privately took some inferior medicine on the market, which instead brought the toxin into the deeper parts, so the urge to urinate became more frequent. The pain also increased dramatically. Later, he bought the "Complete Book of Venereal Diseases" from the Great East Book Company and came to me for treatment. After examination with a urethral reflector, I saw that his urethral mucosa was swollen, and it was difficult to distinguish its wrinkles (as in the first picture). The surrounding area was also almost completely closed. The bladder was distended, probably because the residual urine was not completely emptied. I then performed surgery to drain his urine. On the one hand, I administered "Kelinong" internally to kill bacteria, reduce inflammation, promote diuresis, and relieve pain. After three weeks of taking the medicine, all the mucosal edema had completely subsided, and urination was smooth. I also used short-wave and long-wave electricity alternately for more than a week. Then the wrinkles of the urethral mucosa increased and returned to their original state (as in the second picture), indicating a complete recovery.</p>
<p>(First picture) This shows the swollen urethral mucosa with almost complete disappearance of wrinkles before taking "Kelinong." (Second picture) After taking "Kelinong," the inflammation and swelling of the urethral mucosa disappeared, the wrinkles increased, and the original state was restored.</p>
<h3>Gonorrhea Lecture by Dr. Yao Juyan</h3>
<p>(Clinic): Corner of Siyong Road and Ningbo Road (Consultation hours): 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM</p>
<h3>Gonorrhea Causing Sexual Neurasthenia</h3>
<p>The most common sequela of gonococcal prostatitis is sexual neurasthenia. The prostate gland is located in an important part of the reproductive system. If gonococcal inflammation is not treated urgently, the gland will develop various forms of neurasthenia due to the persistence of the inflammation. The most commonly encountered symptoms at this time are an unpleasant feeling of pressure in the perineum and lower back. There is radiating, indefinite, mild pain in the testicles and the inner thighs. The pain is like piercing, buttoning, pressing, or stabbing. This unpleasant pain also shifts indefinitely, and there is often a slight pain in the bladder before and after urination, or the patient complains of post-micturition dribbling (Hantraufeln). In addition to the pain felt in the epididymis, there is also an abnormal sensation in the penile shaft and glans. The most prominent symptom is the abnormality of ejaculation. For example, frequent seminal emission. Especially after seminal emission, the feeling of fatigue and weakness is severe. Other symptoms include impotence and seminal leakage due to prostatitis. At this point, the sexual nerves have been greatly weakened. Patients are often plagued by anxiety and terror. Infertility is also one of the symptoms of this disease.</p>
<p>Dealing with this disease requires not only removing gonorrhea but also treating sexual organ and neurasthenia concurrently. Mr. Gao Naichang, who lives on Jiaxi Road, suffered from chronic prostatitis, followed by seminal emission, testicular pain, and other symptoms. He was mentally depressed. After bowel movements, a rice-water-colored white liquid would flow out. After my diagnosis, I considered it to be nervous prostatitis. I then performed electrical therapy and administered the German "Kelinong" to increase anti-gonococcal, so that the antibacterial effect would occur directly in the lesion. After five weeks, there was a significant effect. The pain in the perineum, lower back, and testicles had been completely eliminated, indicating that "Kelinong" had reached the point of overcoming this disease. However, the weakness of the sexual nerves had not yet been cured. He was also instructed to purchase and take "Butibody Kang" to strengthen the sexual glands and treat his neurasthenia. After four weeks, seminal emission and impotence were completely cured. Later, his wife also suffered from gonococcal vaginitis. "Kaerxuedi vaginal tablets" were used as suppositories. "Kelinong" was still used as an internal medicine. And it was cured. Fortunately, a son was born this spring. His sexual function has been fully restored.</p>
<h3>Robust Physical Strength - A Must for Men - By Dr. Yang Daonan, who studied in Russia</h3>
<p>The husband that women in the new era pray for day and night: must be as gentle as a lamb and have the strength of a bull! What if a young man commits masturbation and causes seminal emission?</p>
<p>The wheel of the times has crushed the old-fashioned, pale-faced scholar's ideal of male beauty. The "little black carbon" and the sturdy male physique, which were once disliked, have leaped to become the objects of desire in the ideals of women.</p>
<p>No matter how gentle the personality should be, even transforming from masculine to feminine tenderness, a physique like a bull is truly a necessary condition for men in the new era. They must be energetic, powerful, and able to stand at the forefront of the times, loved by their wives and women.</p>
<p>If we look at those who are having divorces or love tragedies, they are actually losing the power to control the opposite sex because of their cowardice and incompetence.</p>
<p>These men who are dissatisfied with the opposite sex have defects in their physical strength. Or, although they are fat, they are only superficially strong. Most of them committed masturbation in their youth, damaging their sexual organs and wasting hormones and semen. Or, due to excessive sexual activity, they wasted their strong physical strength, resulting in small sexual organs, impotence, premature ejaculation, seminal emission, many dreams, and even insomnia, back pain, kidney deficiency, and brain weakness. Therefore, in fundamental treatment, we should invigorate the hormones throughout the body, so that the whole body and kidney physical strength are enhanced, and cell development is strong. This requires taking the hormone preparation "Butibody Kang" to achieve this goal. There is no other way. As for seminal emission, "Naires Seminal Emission Tablets" must be taken at the same time.</p>
<h3>Readers' Corner</h3>
<p>The following medicines have been specified by doctors who graduated from domestic and foreign medical universities. Please be sure to identify the names of each medicine when purchasing! Do not blindly believe in other people's words and buy miscellaneous inferior medicines, so as to avoid danger after taking them.</p>
<h3>Medicine to Quit Smoking</h3>
<p>Editor: I have been addicted to smoking for many years, and I have repeatedly tried to quit but relapse. This is because there is no appropriate preparation during the quitting period, which causes heavy suffering, seminal emission, premature ejaculation, kidney deficiency, and insomnia. Now the deadline is approaching, please indicate a reliable medicine. (Yue Yunlong)</p>
<p>Answer: Tobacco toxins have destroyed hormones throughout the body. Hormonal agent "Butibody Kang" must be used to increase hormones, so that suffering can be avoided, and tobacco toxins in the blood can be completely eliminated.</p>
<h3>Weak Stomach and Constipation</h3>
<p>Mr. He Jianren from Wuhu wrote: I have been suffering from stomach disease for a long time, with little appetite, chest tightness, frequent belching, and often nausea. Also, bowel movements feel dry and hard and are not easy to expel. And after eating, there is bloating and dull pain in the abdomen. On the recommendation of my friend Mr. Xiao, I purchased and took three bottles of "Strong Stomach Essence", which achieved great results. My appetite was opened, and all the symptoms I suffered from were completely lost. I am using this to introduce it to those with the same symptoms.</p>
<h3>Frequent Seminal Emission</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Hemin from Changsha asked: Suffering from severe seminal emission, I now feel dizzy, flushed, have memory loss, and am physically weak. I plan to take "Naires Seminal Emission Tablets" and "Butibody Kang". Where can I buy them? Please let me know!</p>
<p>Answer: All major pharmacies in Shanghai sell them. For mail orders, you can remit money to Haimideng General Office, No. 5 Ningbo Road, Shanghai.</p>
<p>Welcome to ask about illnesses! Please indicate your address and attach return postage and send it to No. 869 Wuding Road, Shanghai.</p>

<p>Does the Suiyuan Military Conflict Affect the Nanjing Negotiations? - Our Reporter</p>
<p>Yesterday, according to our newspaper's telegraph, there was contact in northern Suiyuan. Our reporter specifically visited Mr. Matsumura, the spokesperson of the Japanese Embassy, to inquire whether the Nanjing negotiations would be suspended in case a war broke out on that side. Matsumura replied that the recent military conflicts in Chahar and Suiyuan were matters between the official Chinese army and bandits, entirely China's internal affairs, and had nothing to do with Japan. Pushing the military conflict in Chahar and Suiyuan away completely and considering it an internal affair of China is a statement that perhaps no one will believe? This Sino-Japanese negotiation was originally intended to be a comprehensive negotiation, and the issue of Chahar and Suiyuan is naturally one of the issues in the negotiation. How can the military conflict in Chahar and Suiyuan be completely attributed to bandits?</p>
<p>Moreover, negotiation is not just relying on empty talk, but must be based on facts. Therefore, negotiation and facts have an inherent and close relationship. If facts are facts and negotiation is negotiation, then what is being negotiated? Now, they have already identified the events in Chahar and Suiyuan as bandit actions, but we should pool our efforts and work together to solve these so-called bandits first, to prevent them from spreading.</p>
<p>According to another telegram, students from Tsinghua University in Beiping held a meeting and decided to stop using coal fires for five days, which could yield over a thousand yuan to donate to the national army in eastern Suiyuan to express their condolences. Another news item said that the defensive works in Pingdi Spring were solid, and the firearms were complete, but the problem of flour could not be solved. This problem is no small matter. We should find ways to adequately support these soldiers who are defending the country and its people, and not treat Chahar and Suiyuan as being far away outside the border, looking at them like people from Qin. If Chahar and Suiyuan were to become a world of bandits, advancing step by step, it would be too late to save them. In short, every inch of our land, every foot of our soil, and every one of our people is a part of the Republic of China, and our compatriots. We cannot watch them go under the water, one by one, to their doom.</p>
<p>The way to save them now is also extremely simple. Just like the students of Tsinghua University who are practicing thrift and providing a continuous stream of supplies to the soldiers at the front, we who have not been directly disturbed by the bandits should reduce our dining out, eat fewer snacks, watch fewer movies, see fewer plays, eat fewer boxes of imported cigarettes, wear fewer new clothes, dance fewer nights, play fewer games of mahjong, listen to fewer storytellers, drink fewer pounds of liquor, rent fewer rooms, eat fewer banquets, buy fewer unnecessary items, buy fewer antiques, and buy fewer consumable and useless items. If there are happy or sad events, reduce the scale of displays and save on waste to provide for our soldiers who are defending the country and its people. This is the responsibility of the people of the Republic of China, and it is the responsibility that the people of the Republic of China should fulfill.</p>
<p>Now our citizens should be prepared for war, practice thrift, and save the country. This is not a time for extravagance and pleasure, nor is it a time for living in comfort and honor. We should lift our heads and look, and turn our heads and think.</p>

<p>Where the People's Will Lies - Fang Kewen</p>
<p>"Government troops fought fiercely with rebel troops in the suburbs of this city today, and the efforts of the civil corps were very helpful. A reporter from this agency recently learned of an incident at the front line that is sufficient to prove the civil corps' heroic resistance. When the two sides fought fiercely in the Garapung district yesterday, the rebel troops' artillery fire was extremely fierce, and the morale of the civil corps was shaken. A certain Communist Party member, the leader of the corps, saw this and immediately ordered a counterattack. Upon hearing the order, the civil corps sang 'The Internationale' and advanced bravely. On the way, they encountered six rebel tanks, from which machine gun bullets were fired like raindrops. A member of the civil corps, disregarding his own safety, jumped forward and threw several hand grenades at the tanks, destroying four of them. When the other members of the corps followed him forward, the young member had already died in action. The large civil corps was inspired by this and advanced with one heart, finally repelling the rebel troops." (Havas, Madrid, 8th)</p>
<p>"A large detachment of Communist women soldiers fought bravely in the former royal palace garden outside Madrid City late yesterday, like demons, and suffered heavy casualties. At the same time, women in the capital's Southern Surrey Garabancheel district who supported the government gathered on the roofs and poured boiling oil on the National Army." (Reuters, near Madrid, 9th) After reading the above two news reports, while I was fascinated by the bravery of the Spanish people, I immediately recalled the so-called "Shanghai Incident" five years ago; five years ago, because the people and the soldiers defending the country shared life and death, there was no shortage of such heroic feats that were almost mythological and such moving historical facts.</p>
<p>And now, it has been five years! In these five years, what has become of our beautiful land? What has become of the vigorous and sacrificial spirit of our people, who are willing to die without regard for sacrifice! After seeing the people of Spain bravely rise up to resist the violent enemy, we cannot help but ask ourselves this question. At present, the violent oppression suffered by the Spanish people is not much different from the oppression suffered by the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Over the past five years, our people's spirit has indeed been much more depressed, but it has not died! It is like the magma hidden under the volcano, and when it can no longer bear it, its eruption will still destroy everything!</p>
<p>We can already see the harbinger of this eruption in the alarm from Suiyuan these past few days. Please see:</p>
<p>"Chairman Fu Zuoyi of Suiyuan, General Admonishment to All Officers and Soldiers of Suiyuan Province: Recently, the puppet Mongol bandits, instigated by violent enemies, have launched a large-scale invasion of Suiyuan. They will not stop until they achieve their goal of annexing the Central Plains. You have a responsibility to defend the border. You should be determined to 'repay an eye for an eye' and 'repay a tooth for a tooth' to wipe out the enemy and extinguish the bandit atmosphere. All Chinese people who have any conscience will spare no effort to provide you with manpower and resources. This association is following the meaning of 'Everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the world.' We are willing to share the heavy responsibility of saving the country and seeking survival with you, and we vow to be your backing. Respectfully sent by the Chinese Women's Society." (See various newspapers on the 9th)</p>
<p>"Tsinghua students held a general meeting and decided to stop using coal fires for five days, which can raise more than ten yuan to donate to the national army in eastern Suiyuan to express their condolences." (Central News Agency, Beiping, 10th)</p>
<p>The patriotic movement of Beiping students, which began last December, still retains its undying brilliance. Now, despite all the heavy pressure, their patriotic sincerity is still being expressed in a calm response. "Stopping coal fires for five days" is just a small example. As for the circular telegram from the Chinese Women's Society, it expresses the determination of "those with a conscience." "The common people" have long been prepared to shed their last drop of blood for the liberation of our nation.</p>
<p>The will of the people has been expressed without a trace of doubt. On the eve of the light where light and darkness are fighting, the great masses of the Chinese people have long recognized their sacred responsibility.</p>
<p>The courage of the great masses of the Chinese people is no less than that of the Spanish people!</p>
<p>Cargo Guest - Especially</p>
<p>--A Glimpse of a Mountain City--</p>
<p>Countless spiritual blocks are piled up in the blue sky, stretching, stretching, and gradually spreading out, like a cotton dragon, or like a majestic lion. The sun, that merciless face, is obscured by the screen of peaks, and the afterglow of the sunset still lingers unwillingly on the window facing the alley in the house where I live.</p>
<p>Downstairs, today is a bit different. It seems like something is happening. The shop assistant, after eating, often sneaks upstairs when he has a chance. Sometimes, he even asks us to call him up, so that he can avoid the eyes of others and linger for a while longer. The purpose is very obvious: he wants to get some gossip about Shanghai from our mouths. But today, he broke the convention of the past few days and did not come up. This phenomenon aroused our curiosity.</p>
<p>Following this, the hall where we eat downstairs also became restless. The moving of inventory, the noise of people, and the stern scolding of the old master were all playing at the same time. Looking at the afterglow hanging on the gable wall, it quietly passed away, and the house began to be a bit chaotic.</p>
<p>A bell rang from the other side of West Gate. Experience tells us that a group of horsemen will follow the bell. Standing at the top of the building and looking at the group in a single line, I estimated that there were more than thirty horses, with many white squares piled on their backs, not like salt, nor like oil tanks. Closer, closer, they are local fabrics!</p>
<p>--Desheng Family, No. 30! The shop assistant stretched his throat and shouted in. Following this shout, the passage next to the counter was immediately cleared. The horses were so weak. The one leading the way had three bells and a bunch of red tassels tied under its neck.</p>
<p>The goods were unloaded in a corner of the hall and piled up. The person with the purple-brown face was probably the owner? He dug out a note and handed it to the shopkeeper: Forty Xiecheng, twenty Yongfeng, pick up the goods the day after tomorrow! As he said this, he made a funny face, which made us realize the joy that was instilled by the hardship of the journey.</p>
<p>Everything has returned to its usual state. The dimness of the lights tells you what time it is. Probably the shop assistant got some benefits, hiding in the backyard and softly singing the unforgettable mountain tune!</p>
<p>The eldest sister next door is only eighteen, a small figure, but unfortunately a little numb, watery eyes glanced at my heart, how can I not think of her...</p>
<p>Dad! The teacher said if I don't pay tomorrow, I won't be allowed to study anymore!</p>
<p>Nurse's Husband - Si Quan</p>
<p>Nurse's husband suddenly came to my residence, which surprised me very much. He seemed to have expected it long ago. After sitting down, he immediately stated to me: "I asked the wife (my mother) before I knew that Ah Guan lived here."</p>
<p>In fact, I am not surprised that he knew my residence. My mother lives in the countryside, so of course I could guess that he came to ask my mother. What I am surprised by is that this farmer who hates Shanghai would now also throw himself into the arms of Shanghai.</p>
<p>My nanny is nurse's husband's second wife. His first wife ran away to Shanghai with a rogue in the village. The fields they planted were right along the side of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railway. When nurse's husband learned of his wife's escape, he rushed to the train station like a madman. He almost grabbed every staff member or passenger at the station, asking them if they had seen his wife. The station was in chaos for a moment, and the stationmaster immediately grabbed him and wanted to send him to the Public Security Bureau. At that time, nurse's husband knelt down, crying and begging, asking the stationmaster to allow him to take the train to Shanghai to find his wife. It was not until the neighbors of the village knew about it that they dragged him home by force.</p>
<p>From then on, nurse's husband did not want people to talk about Shanghai. He even hated the railway and train that took his wife away. Whenever he was farming and heard the sharp whistle of passing trains, he would immediately run home, as if a sharp knife had stabbed him in the heart, and he would hold his head and cry.</p>
<p>Later, he married his current second wife, who is my nanny. It is said that her willingness to marry nurse's husband, who was ten years older than her, was because she was moved by his conscience. After they got married, their relationship was very good, and nurse's husband gradually forgot the pain of losing his ex-wife.</p>
<p>Within a year, they had a child, and I was born at that time. His wife was hired in my house to be my nanny. When I grew up and learned about this story, I would often tease him: "Nurse's husband, do you miss your wife?"</p>
<p>He would always stroke my hair and say in a low voice, as if talking to himself: "Ah Guan, you don't understand."</p>
<p>When I graduated from middle school and came to Shanghai to study at university, nurse's husband and nanny brought local products from the countryside to the train station to see me off. When the train was about to leave, I suddenly said a joke again: "Nurse's husband, should I help you find your wife?"</p>
<p>He lowered his head like a child, gave a miserable smile, and did not answer.</p>
<p>I felt very regretful. I should not have re-injured his heart when he happily came to see off Ah Guan, who had been raised on the milk of his wife. Now that he was sitting opposite me, restrained, I thought of that time again.</p>
<p>"Did nanny come out with you?" I asked him.</p>
<p>He nodded and said in a low voice: "I really can't live in the countryside anymore. Everyone encouraged me to come to Shanghai. I'm really afraid of seeing Shanghai!" He glanced at me and continued, but his voice was even weaker: "She immediately entered the factory, and I also want to find something to do, but I'm old..."</p>
<p>Knowing his intentions, I asked him for his current address and how much money the nanny could earn. I promised him that I would help him find a light job.</p>
<p>I asked him to stay for dinner, but he declined, saying that he would come to me again in a few days.</p>
<p>Half a month passed, but I did not fulfill his request. People who really could not live in the countryside all flocked to the city, but the rice bowls in the city were decreasing one by one. Nurse's husband could not sell his strength, so this matter was put aside and gradually forgotten.</p>
<p>This was the first half of the year.</p>
<p>He came early this morning. Seeing his dejected look, I felt very sorry. I don't know what kind of hard life they have been living for the past six months? Seeing him sitting opposite me without speaking, I asked him if he needed some money.</p>
<p>He shook his head, glanced at me, and lowered his head. I saw him shedding tears.</p>
<p>"Nurse's husband, don't be sad! Now the market is bad everywhere. I can't find a job for the time being. Come and live with me. I can still support the two of you..."</p>
<p>After hearing this, he burst into tears, so sadly, as if he had suffered a great injustice. Asking him questions, comforting him, was all useless. He cried, tears dripping on the front of his jacket, wiping them with his sleeves. After a long time, he sobbed and said a sentence: "My wife has run away again!"</p>
<p>I couldn't help but feel a stinging pain in my eyes. Shanghai took away his second wife. What words could I use to comfort him? My vision was blurred, and I seemed to see an old man without a hometown or home standing in the vast desert, taking heavy steps to move forward, but being blown back by the gale...</p>
<p>I also saw the back of an honest man rushing towards the Huangpu River...</p>

<p>Smoke and clouds drift around the Luochuan goddess. Her emerald feathers and bright earrings are stunning. She walks gently, stepping on waves, graceful and charming. A stream separates her from me. I see her silk skirt and white silk shining like snow. I see her emerald sleeves fluttering in the wind, her sash light. I see her high bun adorned with phoenix hairpins. I see her slim waist as graceful as a jade pavilion. I see her bright eyes and white teeth smiling like flowers. I see her dark eyebrows slightly frowning. I love her gentle and considerate appearance. I love her affectionate gaze. I love her elegant demeanor, speechless and charming. The Chen family's thoughts were recorded in writing. I admire his wonderful brush for writing about heavenly beings. In dreams, who is the companion of the celestial family? Only to find that the beautiful barrier melts away, leaving spring at the corner of the sea. The pavilions are illusory and haunt my dreams. The ancestral temple will be worshiped for a thousand years. Only to gain the sound of wind and flags.</p>

<p>The spring scenery is gentle with a light breeze. Zhang Sheng lies sick in bed. Hongniang, following the command of the mistress, personally visits the study to inquire about his health. Sir, I don't know what caused this illness? Why don't you invite a good doctor? Sister, my illness is mostly caused by the young lady. It's like the road to the Blue Bridge is blocked. If the doctor has the art of reviving the dead, it's hard to cure my lovesickness. If you want my health to improve, please help me convey my feelings to the young lady. Once the spring breeze blows, my illness will be relieved. Hongniang spat lightly when she heard this. She then turned to the embroidery room. Thinking of Zhang Lang, she hung her heart.</p>

<h3>Dada Company Increases Capital: Totaling One Million Yuan, Method: Proportional Share Allocation</h3>
<p>The passenger and freight steamship company Tongyang Qian Dada operates five steamships, namely Dada, Dayu, Daqing, Dahe, and Guangxiang, as well as the tugboats Chuyuan and Chuting, and the iron barges Yuanda, Hengda, and Lida. Du Yuesheng is the general manager, and Yang Guanbei is the manager. In order to expand its business and raise more funds, the shareholders' meeting on October 12 decided to increase the capital, changing the total amount to one million yuan. The method of increasing capital is as follows: The first step is to add the company's accumulated construction reserve for the 24th year's dividend surplus and the surplus from the 25th year, after deducting dividends and bonuses, to the original capital of 527,500 yuan, to make up 800,000 yuan. That is, each old share will receive a new share of 50 yuan. The remaining 200,000 yuan will be allocated proportionally to the old shareholders, that is, every four old shares will be entitled to subscribe for one new share. If there is a fractional number, round down for 4 and up for 6. In addition to the new shares that should be subscribed for, all old shareholders may submit a letter of application if they wish to subscribe for more new shares. If there is a surplus, the board of directors will distribute it evenly. The deadline for subscription is set at the end of this month.</p>
<h3>The Urgent Need for Disaster Relief in Gansu</h3>
<p>Negotiations are being conducted by Zhu Qinglan and others regarding the severe banditry disaster in Gansu Province. The provincial treasury is exhausted, and it is difficult to allocate disaster relief funds. The provincial government authorities have telegraphed the Disaster Relief Committee to request funds. Zhu Qinglan, the chairman of the committee, is taking the opportunity of going to Shaanxi to prepare for the establishment of disaster relief orphanages to visit Gansu to discuss disaster relief with the provincial chairman Yu Xuezhong. According to news from the Shanghai office of the Disaster Relief Committee, it is difficult to raise relief funds for Gansu Province from outside sources. Currently, disaster relief is urgently needed. In order to solve the urgent problem, it has been decided to submit a request to the Executive Yuan to allocate funds from the Central Disaster Relief Preparedness Fund to handle urgent relief. After Commissioner Zhu returns south, Zhu will negotiate with Wang Zhen, the chairman of the Central Disaster Relief Preparedness Fund Management Committee, to proceed.</p>
<h3>Detective Shi Was Injured By Stone; Shi Weixiang Sentenced</h3>
<p>A major strike occurred at a Japanese-owned yarn factory in the Hudong District of this city due to labor-management disputes. Shanghai Tongxing, Donghua, and other factories followed suit, with tens of thousands of male and female workers participating. At 5:30 p.m. the day before yesterday, thousands of workers from Tongxing went to the vicinity of the Dakang Yarn Factory on Shengyue Road to prevent workers from entering the factory to work, causing disorder, and also joined the strike. At this time, the Yangshupu Police Department dispatched Detective Claydon on a motorcycle to the scene. He was hit by stones thrown by workers, injuring his right hand and nose, causing him to bleed. Subsequently, Japanese Constable No. 148 arrested Shi Weixiang (age 22), a native of Yancheng, who threw the stones, and took him to the police station for detention. The day before yesterday, he was escorted to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, presented the case, filing a public prosecution in accordance with Article 150, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code for disrupting order and injuring a public official. Detective Claydon then testified about the incident. Although his injuries had been treated by doctors at the Public Hospital, his hand was severely injured and he could not move it, so it was wrapped in cloth and hung around his neck. Japanese Constable No. 148 stated that he had witnessed the defendant throwing stones and injuring the detective. When questioned, the defendant's confession was evasive. The judge sentenced Shi Weixiang to eight months in prison as a warning.</p>
<h3>Tong Xinfu Commits Suicide By Poison</h3>
<p>Tong Xinfu, a native of Huzhou, age 22, who worked at the Liuhe Celluloid Factory at No. 21, Youbang Lane, No. 174, Liaoyang Road, suddenly had a pessimistic thought for some unknown reason. At around 1:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, he used the alias Tong Xingui and went to the Ningfeng Hotel at No. 523, Minguo Road in the French Concession, claiming to be borrowing room No. 1 to stay overnight, and committed suicide by poison. At 2:00 a.m., he groaned in pain due to the poison taking effect. The tea boy Shang Mingde discovered this and reported it to the French police. He was taken to Guangci Hospital by car. Because he was deeply poisoned, the rescue was ineffective, and he died at 7:00 a.m. the next morning. The hospital notified the police, who transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home for examination. The Special Second District Court was notified, and the local prosecutor and forensic doctor arrived at the funeral home to examine the body. After questioning the witness Shang Mingde, because the deceased had no family, it was ordered to be handed over to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home for burial, pending family recognition. Later, his younger brother Tong Xinrong learned of this and rushed to the funeral home to identify his brother's body. He requested the prosecutor to allow him to claim the body for burial, which was approved.</p>
<h3>Gangsters Sentenced Separately for Private Possession of Military Weapons and Extortion</h3>
<p>Gangster Liu Zhongliang, a native of Ningbo, and others conspired to write threatening letters, intending to extort huge sums of money from Le Zhenbao, the owner of Taichang Wood Shop, and Yuan Ludeng. After the case was uncovered, Liu and other six gangsters were arrested by Chief Detective You Agen and Detective Ma Xiushan of the Old Gate Police Station. The threatening letters, pistols, bullets, and other items were seized, and they were escorted to the First Special District Local Court for interrogation and detention. As reported previously, it is now learned that the case has been repeatedly heard and clarified by Criminal Judge Qian Hongye. The verdict was announced yesterday: Liu Zhongliang was sentenced to two years in prison for privately possessing military firearms and one year and six months in prison for extortion, with a total sentence of two years and two months.

<h3>Wife Co-residency Case: Out-of-Court Reconciliation and Divorce; Court Approves Postponement of Summons</h3>
<p>Tao Zhirong, a native of Suzhou, age 24, the brother-in-law of Zhang Yexiao, a performer of the Youmo Theater Group, married Gu Shuhua (age 21 this year), a woman from his hometown, in the twelfth lunar month of the Republic of China year 22, through a matchmaker. They lived together at the home of Zhang Yexiao at No. 6, Shangyi Lane, Xiaocai Market, Baxianqiao in the French Concession. The relationship between the couple was still good. On August 6th of this year, Gu suddenly left without saying goodbye. Her lawyer sent a letter to Tao, alleging that she had been abused and could not bear to live together, and requested a solution. Tao initially ignored it. Later, after being persuaded by mediators, Tao was willing to pay 1,000 yuan to separate. However, after the agreement was reached, it was put on hold because Gu was unable to raise the money. Tao then hired lawyer Wang Hengyi to file a petition with the Special Second District Court, requesting mediation for co-residency with Yin. Yin did not appear, and mediation failed. He then formally filed a lawsuit. On the one hand, Tao investigated Yin's address. On the 1st of this month, he found out that Yin had an affair with Guo Shunlin (age 26), a college student from Changzhou who worked as an insurance broker, and they were living together at No. 15, Yihe Lane, Beile Road. That night, Tao reported to the French police, who sent detectives to catch them in the act. Guo and Yin were arrested and sent to the Special Second District Court the next day. The police department filed a public prosecution against them for the crime of undermining the family. After the trial, Guo was sentenced to three months in prison and Yin was sentenced to two months in prison, each with a two-year suspended sentence. Regarding Tao Zhirong's lawsuit against Yin Shuhua for co-residency, Judge Wu Xiaoke presided over the summons in Civil Court No. 7 the day before yesterday. The plaintiff was represented by lawyer Wang Hengyi. The defendant did not appear. According to the plaintiff's representative lawyer, a criminal case of adultery has occurred after the lawsuit was filed, and the criminal court of your court has sentenced the defendant to guilty with a suspended sentence. The two parties in this case are now reconciling and divorcing out of court, and they request a temporary postponement. If the reconciliation is successful, they will file a petition to withdraw the case. If the reconciliation is unsuccessful, please postpone the hearing. After verifying the situation in court, it was ordered that the postponement be approved and a further summons be issued.</p>
<h3>Female Receptionist Mistreated, Almost Attacked by Gigolo</h3>
<p>Yang Meimei, a 22-year-old girl from Nanjing, lives upstairs in the Beef Shop in Xianqiao County. Because her parents were deceased and she could not make a living, she was introduced to work as a female receptionist at Xiaoshijie (Little World). Recently, a tourist named Yuan Xiaofang, age 23, from Changzhou, who claimed to be in the customs business and not yet married, developed affection for her. Later, they made a vow of lifelong love and opened a room in a hotel to wait for a rented house to live together. Unexpectedly, for half a month, they did not rent a house, and Yuan often took the initiative to pawn Yang's clothes and accessories to make a living, which caused disputes. Yuan then took Yang to a tea house on Sanma Road to borrow money from her relatives to buy things and rent a house to start a family. Yang followed him. Unexpectedly, Yuan was a gigolo. After defiling her body, he wanted to sell Yang Meimei to a brothel as a prostitute. Yang found out and started a big quarrel, but to no avail. Yang knew that she had met the wrong person and returned to Xiaoshijie to work, treating Yuan coldly. As a result, Yuan was resentful. At first, he threatened to chop Yang with an axe. Recently, he has been carrying a weapon, waiting for Yang to go out to harm her. At 3:40 p.m. yesterday, Yang was informed by a colleague that Yuan was carrying two iron awls, waiting for an opportunity to attack. There was indeed a premeditated murder. She secretly informed the patrol police, who arrested Yuan Xiaofang and found the murder weapon on the spot. He was taken to the Yimiao Police Station. After interrogation, he was suspected of premeditated murder and was sent to the Bureau for handling according to law.</p>

<p>Since the Wuzhou Pharmacy created its own Planet Brand Glycerin, the glycerin item has been able to meet domestic needs, and it has indeed solved part of the raw material difficulties. Now, attention is being paid to the production of stearic acid, because stearic acid is also a widely used raw material in China. It is currently being planned, and it is said that the goods will be available in the summer of next year, with a production volume of 1,000 tons per year.</p>
