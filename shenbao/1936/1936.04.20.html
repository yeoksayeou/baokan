<p>（一）對蘇政策　最近蘇聯政府對於東亞、其中尤以對於「滿洲國」、採取積極動向、此事在維持束亞安定上、不得不加以注意、日本政府認爲赤軍無須進駐遠東地方、故應以撤退赤軍爲正當、蓋撇退該項不必要之赤軍、即可剷除蘇滿邊境方面發生不祥事件之根源、同時日本政府亦可將介在日蘇兩薩間之各種懸案、將到迅速解決、以便確立兩國問之友好關係、是所切盼者也、</p>

<p>（倫敦）首相鮑爾溫昨在華塞斯特演說、謂集體安全制、茍非參加之各國、準備同時以軍事制裁對待侵略者、如有必要，雖出於戰爭亦在所不計、則永遠不能收效、並謂今日歐洲之人、有撥開懸於歐陸之陰霾之權力者、莫德元首希特勒若、首相重行聲明英國關於意阿戰事所處之地位、切言英國亟宜擴張軍備、並吾認渠行將引退之謠言、又嚴責意軍在東菲施用毒瓦斯、</p>

<p>首相謂歐洲如再見戰爭、而施用毒瓦斯、則其文明之滅絕、更可確定、渠意此種新戰爭終止時、各國人民激於公憤與戰爭之慘毒、將羣起破壞歐洲之各政府、而吾人將遭遇以混亂反抗居高位者所為惡行之事態、</p>
<p>首相謂渠遇當引退時、自當引退、又稱、渠可屈指以數處於瘋人院外而願代其職者之人數、衆聞此言、歡聲如雷、首相述及國際現局謂就近數星期來最重要之二事、卽　德國重整軍備、　玩弄國聯盟的合觀之、已證明英國軍備之擴張、實有絕對之必要、如英國仍欲盡其對國聯之義務、及維持其在世界中所處之地位、則萬不能不取此步驟、蓋在最近總選舉中、政府曾受國民進行重整軍備工作之委託也、</p>
<p>在歐戰終止時、實施制裁、而使侵略者、立卽屈服世界壓力、覺其事殊易、但今日之國聯、已非創設時之國聯可比至少有三大國卽美德日不參加國聯、此三大國之不參加、使制裁之實施、减少實力、國聯曾不能阻止意阿戰爭、乃取共同行動宣布意國為侵略者、而實施或種制裁、但兩交戰之一、若决計進行戰爭、而不將事案之異見提出討論、聽受仲裁、今似無有力之機關可以終止此戰爭、再、制裁之實施、進行殊覺遲緩、而苟不能得最後之制裁、卽封鎖或武力為助、則今所施行之制裁、已大失其力量矣、但在今日國聯會員國中、如何可使封鎖得組織國聯之各國贊同、誠未敢言也、</p>
<p>意人對於國聯行動、現有一種趨勢、卽以毀譽歸諸個人、而不知國聯之出此、乃集體努力之結果也、渠嘗讀意國報紙、詆責英外相艾登以進行仇意政策為務其不明是非、使人扼腕、此項抨擊、含有兩種誤會渠願予以消除、　外相對此事進行之政策、非其個人之政策、乃英政府全體所定之政策、且得英國入民大多數之贊助者　　此非仇意政策、其志非欲意國失敗或屈服、蓋為擁護國聯盟的計耳、吾入欲國聯盟的成世界之法律、此為吾人之目的、故在盟的有破壞之虞時、吾入責當以全力扶助國聯、此為吾人對此事唯一之志願、渠信世界餘處、對此必能充分諒解、如意人以為吾人之政策志在使共失敗或屈服、則實大錯也、</p>
<p>首相决述及集體安全制、謂吾人現正竭力經營之、且將繼續經營之、吾人今尙未達目的、必再前進、庶可達之、集體安全制苟非參加之各國準備同時以軍事制裁對待侵略者、如有必要、雖出於戰、亦在所不計、則永遠不能收效、此卽謂參加集體安全制之各國必須隨時準備也、</p>
<p>現交戰之兩國、各責對方違背戰事條例、國聯今將作公允之調查、如施用毒瓦斯之說果確、吾人現有種種理由可信其為確、則危及世界、實非淺鮮、如歐洲一大國竟不顧其曾簽宇於反對施用此種毒氣之公的、而在菲洲用之、則安保他日不用之於歐洲乎、歐洲各城、人烟之稠密、過勝阿比西尼亞、共受害亦必遠勝之、歐洲若再見戰爭、而用毒瓦斯以作戰、則其文明之毀滅、更可確定、渠信如果用此、則戰爭終止之時、各國人民激於公憤與戰爭之慘毒、必將羣起破壞各政府、而吾人將遭遇以混亂反抗居高位者所作惡行之事態、</p>
<p>歐洲當軸在努力保特和平中、必須察知國聯今所缺乏者為何、如何始可鞏固之、如何能實施集體安全制、能得何種保障、使毒瓦斯不用於歐洲、但吾人今有何機會乎、渠不欲言預兆完全不佳、今有多處天空、陰霾密布、惟吾人已接法德政府所提出之建議、現方予以至嚴重之注意、同樣建議同時來自歐洲兩大國、此實創見、其能調查本問題、而求使兩國相親善者、孰勝於英國乎、渠在職時、嘗屢言狄克推多之困難、蓋渠信狄克推多制久之必造成禍患、而較其所銷除之禍患為多、德國之狄克推多希特勒、今日其地位所握、撥開全歐陰霾之權力、實較歐洲任何人為大、希氏之權力、實能出此、上帝許希氏得為之、如希氏願為者、則英國所能為之事、將無　毫遺留矣、渠信希氏有此志願、而歐洲無人不欲與之合作、蓋歐洲人民今皆心嚮和平、對於戰爭之慘毒、皆可慄慄也、</p>

<h3 id="c67">學習問題（下） <a href="#c67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— 中央大學教育學院院長　艾偉</p>
<p>第二種關係是學習與情緒的關係。我們知道學習需要相當的智慧，但是一個人的情緒若不穩定，則雖有智慧亦難學習成功。關於所謂情緒的不穩定，現在舉例如下：</p>
<p>在學校裏常有演說運動等會，參加者都想獲得第一名獎品。其實學校開這些會的目的，在使一般學生有練習演說運動身體的機會，不過為比較技能起見，才有第一第二等名之分。在學生方面應採取「勝敗乃兵家常事」的態度。可是學生們往往勝則驕矜敗則氣忿。這兩種態度都不甚好。勝者固不必驕矜，敗者亦無庸氣忿。因為失敗乃成功之母，失敗之後應查明失敗之原因以圖改進。例如畢業會考縱有一二門功課不及格，我們應常於事後重讀，切不可終日憂慮，以為此决不能及格，恐怕下决也不能及格。這樣的態度影饗學業非常之大。常懷憂慮之學生對於世事每抱悲觀，至共極端則成　慮之瘋症，或發生向殺之結果。</p>
<p>情緒的第二個例子是戀愛的情緒。一般學生正當靑年，身體發育巳很充分，戀愛情緒遂亦相隨而來。所謂「知好色則慕少艾」，這是不可避免的事實。「情緒穩定的學生與異性同學相往來，彼此切磋，若行無所事；即遇意中人互講愛情，亦不至忘掠讀書。且因勉勵之故，成續將更優良。惟情緒之不穩定者則不然。偶與異性接觸，即　愛情，一若人盡可妻者；迨對方報以白眼，則又恨之刺骨。如是數决，每次必遭失敗，結果成為憎恨女子者（Woman　hatei），每與友人談及關涉女子之事，必大駡女子不止。此種「緣木求魚」之舉動，在常態人見之，可笑亦復可憐。此輩實為情緒之最不穩定者」。其他還有所謂反動之不能遲延者，就是一有愛人就想結婚，不顧自己的學業。我們如此可下一原則，就是：「凡擬升學者，若有與異性接觸之機會，不宜　到愛情，以免麻煩。如中學生而欲升入大學者或大學生而欲於畢業後繼續深造者，在中學或大學時代，應充分凖備，不必編綿於愛情以作繭自縛。此為就情緒之穩定者而言。若情緒不甚穩定，最好在學業終了經濟獨立之時，然後談及婚事。若此則生活中可以免去麻煩而其學業亦可底於成」。</p>
<p>第三種關係是學習與習慣的關係。假使我們的習慣好，則學習的進步必快。吾則不但進步很慢，恐怕還要妨礙學習。</p>
<p>與學習有關的習慣非常之多，其重要的有三，茲分述於下：</p>
<p>第一為誠實的習慣。這種習慣在一般生活中的重要誰都知道。其實在學習的時候，亦何獨不然。誠實的反面為取巧。現在一部份學生缺乏誠實習慣，但用取巧方法。如畢　止計年限，不顧學問有心得與吾。叉參加考試之時患得患失之心太重，一臨考場，覺其題目太業，即稱病吿退，要求日後補考。有時避難就易，尙未選課，必先探聽某敎員授課的辦法，若平日練習甚多，給分極嚴，而其所指定之參考書又必須全讀，則敬謝不敏，望望然去之若將浼焉。關於誠實習慣的養成，我們應當杜漸防微，不求倖進。「在學習歷程中宜按步就班循序漸進，在一定的時間內須聚精會神以赴之，至學習純熟而後參與試騐。臨考之時對於問題能答則答，不能答則寗付闕如；不應答非所問以　朦混。設不幸而遭失敗，則埋頭閱讀至完全了解而後止。總之，學習是為己，並非為人，但求自己領悟，不必使人盡知」。</p>
<p>「學習習慣之誠實者自知較明，對於工作之能否勝任能决定於事先，不至冒昧從事，致隕越於事後。其在生活中心理比校安定，不似不誠實者不顧自己的事實專想欺騙他人，共言行之相差至遠，有如變態中之二重人格。故為身心健全計，誠實實為學習中不可少之習慣」</p>
<p>第二為秩序的習慣，假使平日謹守秩序，這在學習上有很大的帮助。例如聽講而作筆記，假使記得很有條理，可以帮助記憶。假使聽講時所記雖極潦草，而事後即加以整理以至大考之時必定看得淸楚。有許多人敷衍了事，字不清楚的當時似尙能認識，可是過了兩個月再拿出來看，則完全不認識了。</p>
<p>秩序的習慣是一種科學的習慣。我們在作實騐的時候，若是毫無條理，則其結果必不準確。秩序的習慣也是一種經濟的習慣，因為凡做事有條理，取放物件有秩序，則每日都照樣做决不至於紊亂。無秩序習慣的人，今日把甲物放在這裏，明日把牠又放在那裏，弄得每决要用時都要去找，因此時間費得很多，這當然是不經濟。</p>
<p>第三爲恒心的習慣。求學貴有恒心，因爲學業不是一月或一年所可成功的，必要終身求之至死而後已。所謂做到老學不了。學者若無恒心，進步必定很難，在舉校裏這種恒心的習慣尙易養成，因為平日由敎員指導，計日考查各生的成績，同時目標懸在前面，非繼續努力則不能畢業，在寒暑假期或在畢業以後，恒心的習慣容易破壞，因為那時無人指導，又無目標，遂致懈怠。在這個當兄，我們應當自己振作，並設法引起自己　書的興趣。最好和三五同學相互切磋，因為有了比較必能上進。不過在放假以前的計劃不能太大，貪多務得，往往反無所成。這一點我們也應注意的。</p>

<p>憲法草案、連日各方紛議增加過渡條欵、究其內容如何、亟爲外間所欲知、新聲社記者爰於昨午往訪立法院長孫科氏於其哥倫比亞路私邸、叩詢一切、當承延見、茲錄孫氏談話如次、據孫氏談、關於　　草案物加過波條欵、昨日（十八）憲草審議委員會、已經討論、待未星期中常會當再付議、至其內容、　如憲法正文規定、縣長係民選、但在地方自治未完成之縣、民選縣長、勢有困難、故必須規定一過渡辦法、凡地方自治未完成之縣、縣長暫由政府任命、待其地方自治完成、再行民選、　父如立法委員監察委員、亦規定係民選、惟按照目前實際情形、勢亦必有一種過渡辦法、即一部份民選、一部份暫由政府任命、待至適當時期、再完全民選、　關於憲法施行問題、究於一經頒布後即施行、抑須規定一過渡期間、頒行後經過相當時日再實施等等、均待商討、</p>
<p>授權總統緊急命令</p>
<p>再若授權總統　發布緊急命令之權一點、孫氏之解釋謂、此有歐美各則、均有例可援、例如法國、爲法郎問題、國會曾臨時議决一案、授權大總統、可隨時爲一種緊急處置、以安定金融、又美國對經濟復興政策、亦係國會决議、授權總統、便宜行事、中國內憂外患如是、遇有緊急情事、若照正常規定、須召集國民大會、待大會決議、則已事過境遷、故必須有授機總統以發布緊急命令之權之規定俾凡遇緊急事宜、得由總統相機處躍、過後、再循正常程序、交國民大會追認、</p>
<p>東北代表增額待商</p>
<p>憲法草案、自十八日中央憲草審查委員會修正後、尚須二十三日中常會通過、再交立法院修正及整理、草案即告完成、五月五日、由中央正式公布草案、然後待交國民大會通過頒布、將來大總統之選任等問題、尚須待國民大會討論決定、至國民大會代表產生、東北五省市以所佔代表名額太少、請求增加、中央是否容納該項要求、尚待中常會决定、</p>
<p>西南並無意見參加</p>
<p>最近與王亮疇·載季陶·葉楚倫·諸氏會商、亦係屬於憲法草案問題、王氏以法學家之地位、貢獻意見、並未代表胡漢民先生、而西南同志對憲草過渡條欵之增加、亦無意見參加、至胡先生北來之期、因未獲準確之消息、程天周氏近亦未與會唔、故恕雖見告一切、</p>
<p>非常時期財政問題</p>
<p>關於非常時期財政問題、據孫氏談、係馬寅初等一般學者、之學理見解、非立法院所屬財政委員會之主張、惟本人意見、將來以所得稅爲國家財政收入之大宗、恐於經濟落後之我國、决難與歐美諸國相提並論、故此種學理上之見解、事實上似難容許、</p>

<p>劉氏致詞　首由海員黨部劉　公主任致詞、略謂今日爲趙朱兩代表將次放洋之期、兄弟謹代表海員同志說幾句話、我們　得海員亦爲勞工上之一種、不過勞工在陸地工作、海員則在水上工作、大凡國家之盛衰、常以海岸綫之長短爲正比例、而海岸綫之長短與海員之多寡、又有極密切之關係、所以海員之進退多寡、對於國家民族、以及國防上·軍事上·工農商業上·都有深切的關係、吾人的衣食住行、除天然物外、無一不受勞工之恩惠、但現我國勞工薪資之低微、待遇之不平等、艱難困苦之狀、真令人目不忍睹、我們希望越朱兩代表、此次出席國際會議時、能將我國全體工人之痛苦　況、傳達到國際、其所需要提出之問題、固然很多、最切要者莫如下列兩點、　提高工人地位、　解除工人痛苦、能如此始不負我總理積極爲工人謀幸福之遺教、現在滿飲一杯、預祝前途順利、次海員工會王寄一秘書致調、略謂、海員工友之福利待遇、此不僅是他們本身的問題、也是全民族的要求、弱小民族的工人、在薪金微薄、待遇不平等之下、我們自當努力爲之解除其痛苦、希望趙代表·朱代表、乘此國際會議之機、作整個要求、並希抽出餘暇、做聯絡工夫、以期於經濟上·精神上、物質上·能得到援助、儘量宣傳弱小民族之困苦、以喚起平等待我之民族、滿餘此杯、以示慶祝、</p>
<p>朱氏答詞　朱學範答詞、略謂、今天承蒙中華海員黨部·海員工會·及各社團設宴欵待、非常感謝、兄弟學識經驗、都很淺薄、此次奉中央令出席國際勞工會議、將來的結果如何、現在覺得毫無把握、剛才劉同志·王同志·給予很好的指教、兄弟很誠懇的接受、並願與趙代表各盡棉薄、共同努力、以期達到勞工會議海事會　很圓滿的結果、我們曉得中華海員煎部與工會、爲勞工努力、很有成績、尤其在楊特派員領導下、更有極顯著的進步、兄弟對於楊特派員及諸位同志之爲勞工謀福利、得到非常的安慰、我們這次出席共有二個會議、就是國際勞工會議、與海事會　、這兩個會識裏、有許多問題要提出來討論、國際勞工大會、是國際勞工共有的組識、所以國際上許多勞工問題、也都要在此會裏解決、一般的看來、中國勞工問題、與一般國際勞工問題、情形不同、因爲國際勞工問題很單純地祗有勞方與資方的問題、而中國方面是勞方與資方問題、兼而有帝國主義壓迫剝削問題、剛才劉王二同志很明白地指示我們、要求中華民族的解放、我們自然　盡十二萬分的誠意去努力、不過學範自知學識淺薄、能力有限、此次出席會議、單靠個人的力量、是決不能　極大的效果、所以極希望在座諸位同志、時刻加以指教、俾能在這次會議裏、收到相當的　功、回國以後、定作一誠懇之報告、以作諸位同志的參考、今天很榮幸的參加此會、除表示謝意外、　敬視諸君一杯、</p>
<p>趙氏答詞　趙班斧答詞、略謂、今日承海員黨部海員工會及各社　、設宴招待、　　厚誼、　斧異常　謝、　　年來勞資雙方、　原　上有許多衝突、是以又召開二十一屆會議來解決、班斧承楊特派員（虎）之選拔、自覺能力學識均差、感覺到十二分惶恐、好在朱代表在中國勞工界是有成績的、兄弟能隨朱代表之後、母任榮幸、農村破產的範圍、廣佈全世界、自總理將散漫的海員、組成整個的在革命史上有很光榮之表演、兄弟此次出席國際海事會議、有幾個重要議案須提出的、就是船舶上海員工作的時間、海員疾病之保障、海員假期給付工資等問題、此外尚有二個問題、（一）中國海員與外國海員工資之不平等、又其同船職之海員待遇、總是外國海員高、中國海員低、在道理上甚是不平、此次擬向海事會提出、（二）宜取銷包工制、以減少工人之被剝削、希望此次會中、將中國海具痛苦表明、取得公道的判斷、此外在會前會後、擬觀察各個海員情形、以作參考、但班斧自覺才　學淺、恐不能勝此重任、好在早有光榮歷史的海員黨部·海員工會、均在楊特派員領導之下、又有朱代表之贊助、其結果當然不致甚壞、謹借主人的酒、以爲答謝云、繼有陳海峯演说、詞長從略、</p>

<p>大公社云、寳山旅滬同鄉會、昨具呈南京鐵道部、請展長淞滬鐵道支綫、直達寳山城、以利交通、其呈云、呈爲懇請准予延展京滬路淞滬支錢、以抵至竇山縣城、藉利交通、而臻繁榮事、竊按</p>
<p>吾邑寶山</p>
<p>位居海濱、扼峙江口、頗饒形勢之勝、且接邇滬埠、比鄰商港、允擅流暢之利、第以偏處一隅、交通阻梗、民智閉塞、等若僻壤、欲期繁榮、莫由實現、識者早引以爲憾、敝會以寳山爲桑梓之邦、更感切膚之痛、同人再四籌商、僉以不謀寶山繁榮則已、欲謀繁榮、當以興闢交通爲首務、况寳山復興、其前途之福利、非僅寳山人可獨沾實惠、播益之廣、</p>
<p>允稱可觀</p>
<p>敝會不揣冒昧、用敢臚陳所見、爲鈞部進一言焉、査寳山現有交通命脈、唯恃京滬路淞滬支錢而已、淞滬綫起於上海、以迄吳淞鎭砲臺灣、而砲臺灣距寳山縣城、猶有四華里之遙、通常非恃人力車、卽賴步行以爲溝通、但斯短距離之路程、輾轉上下行旅者、每感不勝煩累、若花　苻不靖、晚上更使入人裹足不前、今若延展淞滬支綫、以達寳山縣城南門外橋堍、則</p>
<p>交通暢利</p>
<p>有期、復興自可指日而待、砲臺灣至寳山南門、相距不滿兩公里、沿途平坦、培修路基、敷設路軌、尙屬輕而易舉、估計費用、該錢需用地畝、以直綫十畝計、每畝卽以二百元估價收買、費用僅二千元、再增築路費用、以普通標準論、每華里作一萬元計、今路錢僅及一公里又三分之一、所費不過三萬三千三百餘元、如建造站房、增派員工、所費至多一萬二千元、綜核</p>
<p>各項費用</p>
<p>有五萬元已足斯數、雖不足信、尙須專家考核、然就實地而論、似不致有懸殊之差、設能樂觀厥成、則寳山縣城、得以直達滬埠、與新上海縣交通之迅捷、爲何如哉、寳山地價低廉、必誘使一般企業家、踴躍爭投鉅資、興建農塲工廠、轉瞬大上海計劃吿成、寳山密邇新港、彼時將益改舊觀、愈呈活躍、其感美滿也　如、再言寳山城界</p>
<p>大江風景</p>
<p>之美、亦有足道、交通旣便、定必吸引遠方人士　居、有成優美住宅區之趨勢、卽此二端、裨益於寳山者固非淺鮮、若言養路、更足綽有餘裕、且言寳山西南與太嘉二縣、接壤其間、已興築汽車大道、東與淞滬爲鄰、尙不能通暢、自如淞滬一帶、素稱國防前哨、果能延展路錢、東西南北可成一氣、其有力於國防者又何如、據此以諭、築斯鐵路、何獨嘉惠寳邑、</p>
<p>一舉數利</p>
<p>豈係誇張其辭、敝會有鑒及此、不敢緘默、爰經第七决理監事聯席會議、提出討論、一致通過、立卽備文呈請鈞部、伏乞鑒核、再京滬鐵路局、年有益餘、斯區區支出、諒不致影響大局、况是舉有益於地方國家者至鉅、義不容緩、迫不及待、爲此仰祈鈞部尅日訓令京滬鐵路局、派員勘視路綫、及早興工、以底於成、母任翹企待命之至、謹呈鐵道部部長張、</p>

<h3 id="c122">禁烟運動 <a href="#c122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— 吳開先</p>
<p>兼吿上海各界同胞</p>
<p>禁烟運動，非自今日始也。淸道光元年，兩廣總督阮元氏即奏請禁烟：十九年林則徐氏查辦廣東海口事務，始以理論見之實際，嚴禁鴉片，悉燒英商存烟。乃帝國主義者甘爲推銷鴉片而啟戰爭，於是我以戰爭失敗而烟禁遂弛。辛亥革命以後，總理孫先生就任總統，與民更始，始一再嚴申禁令，務淸烟毒。惜乎總理引退以後，政權落於北洋軍閥之手；借名禁烟從而歛錢者有之，强迫種烟資以養兵者亦有之。於是禁令廢弛，烟毒充斥，禍流全國，愈演愈烈。吾人回溯百年來之禁烟運動，深慨其一張一弛，一暴十寒，未嘗不痛心疾首而隱憂彌已也！</p>
<p>國民政府奠都甫京以後，即以禁烟拒毒爲急務，去年中央政治會議爲促進禁烟效率計，復强化禁烟機關，特任蔣委員長爲禁烟總監，頒布治罪條例，確定禁絕年限，務於法定年內肅淸烟毒。一年以來，成效卓著，國際視聽，爲之一變。此百年未竟之禁烟大業，在國民政及蔣總監督率之下，共必如期完成，實可預卜。惟吾人於此，尙有一事必須深切注意：吾國領土之內，尙有特殊區域如上海天津漢口等外國租界地在。此等特殊區域，格於條的，政府權力所不能及；歷爲販賣烟毒之集散地，而一切飲鴆自安沉湎忘返之人，亦多麕集於是。欲圖禁烟事業之澈底完成，對於此等特殊區域，自非政治力量所能爲力，而實有待於社會力量之努力焉。蔣委員長亦嘗有見乎此，會愷切以吿吾人曰：「中國各方面的情形，比較特殊，禁烟的事情如果單靠政府的努力，的確不容易澈底做到，因爲有許多地方，（允其是上海漢口天津各處的租界），以及許多情弊，（允其是外國人在中國境內販賣毒物），政府的力量所不能完全達到的。所以有許多場合，與其單靠政府的力量來禁烟，還不如靠社會的力量，更加有效，」又云。：「對於國際方面，允其是上海漢口天津等處租界，外國人直接間接製販毒品的事情，爲我國政府權力之所不及，我們惟有盡力引起國際輿論的同情，藉社會的與道義的力量來防製，使販毒謀利的外國人，亦不敢明目張膽來做犯罪的行爲。」是故吾等身居上海之人，必須深體政府堅决禁烟之苦心，協助政府，共同拒毒，表現社會的組織力量，造成强有力之祛毒與論；，使一切販賣謀利以及飲鴆自安之中外國人，不復得以租界區域爲淵藪，不復得以國際勢力爲護符。而使租界區內之禁烟運動，得與我政府之禁烟運動，相爲桴鼓。如是，則澈底清毒之大業，庶可完成。</p>
<p>總理嘗云：「鴉片流毒中國，垂及百年，」沉溺通於貴賤，流衍遍於全國，失業廢時，耗財殞身，浸淫不止，種族淪亡，其禍蓋非敵國外患所可同語。」人之從東北四省歸者，亦恒以「敵人黑化我東北同胞。冀滅其種族」爲言。嗚呼！吾人居今日而不再努力禁烟，非惟如林則徐之言，無可籌之餉，無可練之兵，而已種族淪亡，即迫眉睫。是固敵人之所馨香禱祝者，吾人寗能漠視而袖手耶？救亡之道多端，禁烟實一要圖，我上海各界，共亦知所努力乎！</p>
<h3 id="c123">禁烟與民族復興 <a href="#c123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— 陸京土</p>
<p>民族的盛衰，係基於其搆成民族的各個份子是吾健全爲斷。中國近百年來國勢極度衰落，究其所以衰落的主因，可說全是受烟毒的禍害所造成。允其因鴉片問題而引起的中英戰役，造成帝國主義在我國根深蒂固的勢力，開列强侵略之端，實爲我民族生存上最大的致命傷。自對內而言，烟苗遍地，邊遼省區的農田幾盡植毒物，反使糧食缺乏，不得不抑給於洋米、每年因此而損失的金錢，誠不可數計；同時人民深中烟毒，不但喪財誤事，使個人立陷於傾家破產之境，且因個人體格的衰弱，因而民族精神衰落至一蹶不振，若再任其延蔓，十百年後恐全國將盡成烟民病夫，不待人家侵略，我們自己也會自趨滅亡了。此種無形的烟禍之烈，實較任何政治軍事經濟侵略爲允甚。</p>
<p>所以中國目前的問題，不祇是如何抵禦外侮，允在於如何澈底禁烟。提起禁烟，在中國已有很久的歷史，在明末政府已開始禁烟，可惜過去的辦法都不適宜，不是操之過急，就是流於放縱，結果都沒有成效，加以民國以來連年內戰，軍閥割據，致禁政廢弛，反使烟毒彌漫全國，愈趨愈烈，這在民族立塲上誠是一件痛心的事。</p>
<p>自國府奠都後，中央認定烟毒一日不澈底肅淸，民族卽一日無由振　，故將禁烟列爲要政。最近復訂定六年禁絕計劃，腹地省份一律禁種，邊遠省份也劃定縣份限期减少產量，同時限期勒令烟民登記逐漸戒除，並頒佈極嚴厲的法令，對於裁種，製造，運輸，販賈，及包庇受賄等處以死刑無期徒刑或高度的有期徒刑，規定烟毒案犯不由晉通法院受理，而由軍事審判機關裁判執行，以期迅速。至於整個的計劃之推進及監督指等責，由蔣委員長親自主持，這是與從前歷來禁烟政策截然不同之處，也足以表示政府此决所抱的决心。</p>
<p>不過政府之所以如此制定嚴峻法令，揆諸世亂典重之意，也是不得已而同時不可少的手段。然法律是死的，法律自己本身不會發生效力，全賴人去推行，允其要人民眞正的醒覺，與政府合作切實貫澈禁烟計劃。現在禁烟當局在檢舉期內特許烟民登記，不予處罪，這並非整個禁烟計有什麼變更或中止，這是給一般老年與患病而不能立卽戒絕的烟民一個自新之路，希望國人一致努力宣傳，使烟民都能明瞭政府的苦心，從速自動投戒，立志戒除不良嗜好，重新做個好國民。</p>
<p>最後還希望全國社會頒導份子與智識份，應該以輿諭的力量，來改變人民的心理，輔助政府法令的不足，養成人民走向光明的積極的生活習慣，共同開闢民族今後的新生命。</p>

<p>社會上天天在戰爭，時時在戰爭，這戰爭卻以智力代替了武器，戰爭的結果，當然是智力高的人佔勝利，智力差的人遭失敗，其影響所及，實不亞於武器的戰爭。然智力差的人，果抱有「智者千慮必有一失，愚者千慮必有一得」的心理，努力邁進，終不難有出頭之日。</p>
<p>吸鴉片的人，自初吸至臨終，可以五個「　　」字詳述其吸食過程，（卽引，影，隱，癮，尹是也）初爲戚友所誘「引」，而稍稍嘗試，不久生理上乃受「影」響，他人起懷疑而詢問之，仍一味「隱」瞞，尙無戒吸之心，久而遂成「癮」，自是體弱力單，百病叢生，結果乃「尹」（駐）矣，吸者見此，若猶沉迷不悟者，踓不死不遠矣。（註：「尹」乃「一尸」之合，卽謂尸首爲木槓所抬，猶言死也。）</p>

<p>雖然在很早，在很早的初春，娘兒們早有穿起了薄薄的單衣，在春行著夏令。但是，那還是只限於少數。待到了清明之後，那才能整齊劃一，一條條的玉臂，紛紛從短衣袖裏，脫穎而出。同時，玉腿兒上，也除掉了羊毛襪，敷上了粉了。鏤空高跟鞋裹的比了鄉色的指甲油，似乎在向著人，呈送著笑靨。</p>
<p>顯然地，襪廠老闆，在清明之後，不啻是度著年中的一個最難困的非黃金時代。因爲在清明之後，任誰都得對著高階級中的勞苦羣衆，卻沒命的拉開著嘴兒，儘笑。爲的是清明之後，柳枝兒上的葉　兒，都覺得躱在裏面，悶得慌，而挺出來，透著氣，那麼，勞苦羣衆身上的　棉襖兒，也可以輕鬆地近卸掉了，換上夾的，單的，不用再打著顫了。</p>
<p>的確，清明之後，天氣是暖和了。觀音報，元帝報，張大帝生日，老和尙過江，可怖的節報，都已過去了，春風輕鬆地在大地上打著轉，催生了大地的每一角上的青草。都市裏的紳士與娘兒們尖頭鞋，娘兒們的高跟鞋，在諧和的笑得在田間嚙食著青草的牛兒，羊兒，像農村中的姑娘們，一樣的顯著怕見生人而靦觍。</p>
<p>不用靦觍，這正是牛兒，羊兒的黃金時代，盡量兒的嚙著青草罷。清明之後，再過不多時，太陽是逐漸地將放出炎威來，逐漸地將催著農夫們，喘著氣兒淌汗了。聽哪，播榖鳥已在殷勤地呌着了。呌着，呌着，呌着人們播榖，否則，晤，——不作工，莫怨著肚子裏面餓得鬧蹩扭。</p>

<p>彥士是在上年十二月十五日得病，初因頭目昏眩，繼則血壓增高，當請西醫金問淇臧伯庸及某日醫治療，針藥兼施，但病勢有增無减，……（中略）</p>

<p>—</p>
<p>烹子療飢</p>
<p>西醫診斷如是，乃議改請中醫，因於二月十八日遷出寶隆醫院回寓診治，先後服中醫張藝城王仲奇夏應堂應父方藥，中間病勢起伏無常，時生變化，彥士平日很信仰西醫沈麟伯，尤是幼年友好，見此情形，故一面急電北平沈麟伯醫生，當於三月一日到寓診治，彥士和我執手道：「麟伯已到，我的病可以託付他了。並詢問我女兒芝芳在醫校情形，並謂獨鶴劍侯志蓀均有信來問我病狀，請你代爲謝謝他們的　意」。但是這天麟伯醫生診察結果的論調和其他各醫生相同，認爲此症危險極點，無法挽，但是他的臉面已經浮腫了，雙目已近盲神，病勢緊急萬分，九日晚忽接到電話說彥士去世了，遺體已入上海不殯儀館棺殮，唉！那裏料到那次的會見，便成永訣。這夜我悲哀極了，輾轉反側，竟不能成寐，次日送彥士遺像到報館裏去，因和劍侯談起彥士待人的真摯，不覺悲泣淚下。（下略）</p>
<p>以彥士的年齡而論，正在壯年，英俊可畏，他不該死，再以現在中國建設的急進，需要大批人才，而尤其是現在的領袖，然能像彥士先生那樣碩學而兼勇敢的精神，在短期間創辦許多事業得到偉大的成功，恐怕鳳毛麟角，不易多得。而彥士在這強隣壓境，國難嚴重的今日，更不應該死，但現在彥士終究是死了，蓋棺論定，所給與社會的影響是怎樣？不但電業界是推動了一位領袖，以平日努力服務，作事不苟的精神，亦可說我們失去了一位導師。故彥士死後，博得許多人的辛酸之淚，均非無因。現在各團體及電氣界同人暨生前友好於昨日假湖社開會追悼的時候，更有許多沉痛的悼辭，唉，彥士！你現在脫去了　　而飛去，但我想起了往事，祇有悲哀，祗有傷感，不，也昨是痛惜罷！（却酬）</p>

<p>我呀了一聲說：這女主角是收塲很慘呢。怎麼比起綠珠來了。蘭厂說：你沒有看到撐將淚眼四個字嗎？這也無非是一咱比方。你看下面這一首就明白了。我看下面是：</p>
<p>蓋聞滄海多波，紅顏薄福。鸚鵡以能言而投　，孽非自作。山　以善舞而觸鏡，天實爲之。是以能藏金屋，不妨生碧玉於小家。一人侯門，誰得尋紫　　邸。</p>
<p>蓋聞良禽擇木，不以遭綱羅而易此心。芳草流芬，不以生荊棘而裏其質。故徐庶別蜀，策未魏謀。李陵事胡，心存漢室。</p>
<p>蓋聞精衛填海，未减痴心。愚叟移山，且竟素願。牡丹亭畔，寓言還杜女之魂。四馬門中，故主園樂昌之鏡。故満山是血，夜深啼遍哀鵑。一葦可航，春歸終期　燕。</p>
<p>我點點頭說：試說得很明白，是說男主角了。就高聲念道：蓋聞孝思不　，有歧路回車之私。人言可畏，秉瓜田納履之戒。故東家宋玉，　感投桃。陌上羅敷，終虛解佩。</p>
<p>蓋聞月沒星替，並是因緣，李代桃僵，相爲禍福。故绦珠雖出於賈氏之園，孔雀不飛於仲卿之室。</p>
<p>蓋聞漢家信絕，明妃之淚偷垂。楚宮腰輕，息嬀之心早碎。故面壁經年，留此身以有待。楚歌四起，慟去日之苦多。</p>
<p>我不由得跌脚說：這女人可憐！就憑面壁經年，留此身以有待說起來，這人就大可敬佩。蘭厂沒說什麼，點點頭。以下許多首，文字都很隱晦，有客去荒園，天寒尙倚翠竹，馬嘶芳草，樓上立盡黃　。雪海馳書，身甘一死，寒燈割臂，事足千秋。還可以懂，都是說這女人不錯。第十八首，就比較的明白些說：</p>
<p>蓋聞河梁唱別，念生死之悠悠，樓上斷魂，感年華之寂寂。故抽刀斷水，情猶繋乎勘藕絲，煉石袖犬，身不甘於泥絮（一〇）</p>

<p>— 馮摩尼</p>
<p>因為春寒料峭，所以覺得氣候太凉，我住的亭子間裏，更其寒氣森森，沒有適當衣服，委實很難消受，尤其地上是水門汀，愈加覺得陰颼颼的，於是想了一個辦法，和二房東商量，搬上新造的三層擱樓。</p>
<p>雖則走上三層擱必須灣倒身體才能走進，而且時常會碰痛頭顱，我心裏很不滿意，但是比了亭子間，溫暖了許多，而且房價比較便宜，也就馬虎住下。</p>
<p>可是氣候突然的暖熱起來，三層擱上風也不透，委實氣悶不過，而且伏在牆壁裏的臭蟲已在騷動，整夜沒得安睡，感覺得不舒服於是再想搬到亭子間去。</p>
<p>亭子間幸而沒有租戶，我估計袋裏全部財產，僅有法幣四元，幸虧還有兩塊錢的稿費併凑在內，便又搬回亭子間，我覺得舒適，胸懷也暢然，好像重見光明似的愉快。</p>
<p>因為我老是坐在屋裏，並不曉得外邊是什麽樣兒，可是看見了後樓嫂嫂穿着一件極薄的綢單衫，我便又些懷疑起來，氣候雖是溫暖了些，但夏天的衣服，畢竟不大適用，於是我到外邊去看看春天的氣象，順便去送兩張稿子。</p>
<p>走到馬路上，已覺得眼花繚亂，那些摩登女子，全是穿的沒袖子的長衣，的確是很輕鬆，頓時我身上覺得沉重起來，我竟糊塗得自己穿着的破厚棉袍還不覺着熱，我朝自己身上一看，很有些慚愧，也不敢瞧別人，垂着腦袋在太陽光下跑路，額角上的汗珠一顆一顆鑽出來，覺得什麽都模糊，好像在這世界裏並沒我這個人存在。</p>

<p>食慾不振，一般最易忽視；豈知延久而成胃呆胃弱，致全身營養不良，面黃肌瘦，體力孱弱，終至虛脫而漸入險境，滋可嘆也。</p>
<p>住百老滙之謝君，年二十九。某决食後作劇烈運動，致起脹痛。自此食多輙吐，胸院壓重，嘔泛酸水，嘈雜作噎，叉兼便秘多屁，腦脹煩心，日陷憔悴，寖至失眠，羸弱不勝，迭藥無效，乃投余所乞診。即指服德國「强胃精」，未及三盒，食慾大振，脹痛嘈酸盡失！又因此藥內含脾素（內臟荷爾蒙），擅補血補腦，故服後即若酣睡，精神大旺；連服五瓶，體重頓增，肌肉充盈，腰脚輕健，今有三年未發，無怪此藥被譽爲胃病之寳筏云。</p>

<p>女子白帶，爲男子最所厭惡之病，不僅身體上受到莫大痛苦，即精神上亦受最大打擊也。故有白帶之婦女，其精神莫不十分沈鬱，神經因受刺戟而失眠。此時患者膣部恒有膿血物流出。小便時作痛，局部浸潤腐爛，發出特異之臭氣，月經不調。不能房事，夫婦感情，亦因而淡薄。終則厭棄。是白帶實女子最痛苦之症狀也。然如能早用德國『卡而雪地氏陰道片』，必能早日就痊，若因體虛而患白帶者。則可兼服『補女容』以安補其神經，而壯其體力。因淋病而息白帶者，可兼服『克淋儂』撲滅其淋菌。內外兼顧，功效無不立見，重者三四星期，輕者二三星期，即能完全治愈。且愈後仍能照常生育也。</p>

<p>傷風初起，若不根治，即成久咳，癢氣喉嗆，欬嗽頻頻，咯痰不爽，胸悶食减，每成內傷，而轉癆瘵。苟欲根除痰欬，補肺防癆，惟有服用鱉魚比目魚熊鹿之肝肺胰等臟器荷爾蒙製劑一補肺拿爾」，查此藥於善治傷風與一切頑固之欬痰及小兒百日咳外，允宜於一二三各期肺癆餌服，且　內富含蛋黃素，功能增加體內高爾基氏體，對於煙客欽痰及老年哮喘症，最有卓效，若用爲戒烟，亦能迅速斷癮。因藥性和平，故服者日衆，而余臨床實騐，亦最樂用此藥，莫不迅獲奇騐云。</p>

<p>如何使老白濁早日根治</p>
<p>白濁沐非難治，其所以成爲難治者，一山於患者延宕失治，一由於臀治未盡其法，因而成爲難感之病耳。蓋淋菌一入慢性時間，吾人本身亦發出一種抗毒作用故痛苦不若急性時之甚，但此淋菌時時有傳染他人之危險，如與異性接觸後，恒於一星期內發生淋病。</p>
<p>此等情形，允多見已婚夫婦。如陸潤亭君，於六年前即患淋病，歷經名醫治療，並未根治，後轉成攝護腺炎，及尿道狹窄，會陰鈍痛，放尿射精，俱感劇烈痛苦，有時竟作痙學性者。其夫人亦染白帶，膣道清痛，膿血交流，局部赤腫，月經亦因而困難。嗣陸君向大東書局購「性病全書」，來乞治療，乃行攝護腺按摩，及電氣療法外，內服德國「克淋儂」，以通尿殺菌，消炎定痛。的五星期而全愈，其夫人白帶，亦經余指示外用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」，每晚以一片納入膣道深部。以除白帶，內服「克淋儂」，以肅淸病菌，亦六星期而帶凈痛止。後服「補女容」一月，經水按期而至，夫婦二人皆經血淸騐查，無淋毒反應。可知此種老白濁，如非兩人同治，收效决難如是之速，及愈後不復再發也。</p>

<p>所得稅（Income　tax）是國家對於僩人或法人在一定期間內之經濟的純收入——所得，直接賦課的一種租稅，係屬於人稅，其一般的優點有　稅普及，不若他種租稅如田賦房捐營業稅多限於局部的。　負擔公平，不管它是直接稅或間接稅，凡係採比例課稅制的，都是貧者負擔重，富者負擔反輕，完全漠視國民納稅的能力。所得稅則顯然有它的特點，其一爲對於所得的數目加以區別，即所謂「累　課稅」（Progresslve　taxation），所得越大，稅率也越高，故富有階級的負擔加重，此在超過所得稅上所表現的爲愈甚。所謂超過所得稅者，係對於不問來自何方的總所得，超過某一數額時，除普通所得稅外，再課以累淮率特高的附加稅，故亦稱附　所得稅。其二爲對於所得的性質上加以區別，即所謂「差別待遇」（Dilfereitiation），最主要的如將勤勞所得的稅率减輕，財產所得的稅率加重，庶不勞而獲者的負擔增大。　收入穩固每在一定期間都有可靠的收入。　富有伸縮力，一般租稅多不易隨時變更稅率，故必要時無法實行政府的政策。，但所得稅則是具有相當彈性的，在承平時代固然可以把稅率降低，即遇必要時——如發生戰爭等之非常時期，亦較易變更稅率，可視各階層納稅能力所及，分別將稅率提高，而使政府便於籌得緊急費用。</p>
<p>所得稅之種類及其課稅方法</p>
<p>所得稅由於征課手段的標準範圍不同，可分下述二類：</p>
<p>綜合所得稅　綜合所得稅（Lumpsum"　in　come　tax）亦稱一般所得稅或總數所得稅，這是不問所得之來自何處，將個人或法人各方而所得加以綜合，以其全體合計爲標準而課稅，即所謂綜合課稅制度（System　of　the　Tump　um"　income　tax）。它的優點是累進率易於收效，負擔格外公平，但其缺點即爲不易將調查及綜合工作辦得圓滿，往往會生出許多弊端。所以，如無完好的行政制度，反將有不公平的傾向。</p>
<p>泉源所得稅泉源所得稅（Sioppage　atthe　source"　income　tax）亦稱部分或個別所得稅，係將一切所得各依其門類而分的，有的固仍須應用調查估計等方法，但有的可以從支付者手裏預先扣取。優點；在無法將一切所得同時征稅的國家，亦可逐步採行，俾不致失之過急。不過，分門別類，征收手續和費用恐非增多不可，且因累進率效用减少，有時負擔必不能完全公平。</p>
<p>以上係就課稅手段的總範疇如何而將所得稅分類，茲進而略述各種不同的課稅方法：</p>
<p>申報法　這是由納稅者自己申報一定時期內的所得，大致於每年年度終了時，納稅人將各種帳冊送呈當地主管官署或征收機關發交調查委員會審核，憑帳冊而定稅。惟所得額的確定，須在總收入內除去本年度的支出，前年度的盈餘，其他各種公課及保險金公積金等。這種方法須具備完善的帳簿組織，吾則，以多報少，官民通同舞弊等事。</p>
<p>外標推定法　這是按照外表的標凖，推定所得之數，從而核算其應納的稅額。這種方法優點，手續較便，並可免除申報法中之以多報少。但亦不無缺點，如估計的工作，欲求確實與公平，殊屬難能，而又容易串通舞弊。</p>
<p>溯源法　這是對於薪給·租金·利息等，其听得之有確定來源者行之，於收入尙未歸所有之前，即從支付者方面先行抽取。道種方法的優點，最顯著者爲减省手續，防阻逃稅，數目凖確等。然而，却也有缺點，由於分別課稅結果，减少了累進稅率的效能。</p>
<p>右述三種方法，優點缺點互見，如何採用，要宜視各國各自的情形而斟酌之。</p>
<p>所得稅與收益稅的區別</p>
<p>這裹應該注意的，就是所得稅和收益稅的區別問題，歷來對於所得稅和收益稅二個名詞論爭很冬；而在表面上看來，所得與收益，確似相類，所以往往容易被人混同。然而，如果我們能够從兩者的本質上去考察，却也不難找出它們的不同點來，試槪述之：</p>
<p>所得稅和收益稅的稅源雖屬同一，但課稅的根據則各異，所得稅是以有收入的人的所得爲標凖，收益稅是以有收入的物的收益爲標凖。所以，所得稅是以人爲對象，稱作人稅，收益稅是以物爲對象。稱作物稅。自然，人與物的嚴格的分別是很難的。　所得稅是普遍的，凡是合於課稅標凖的一切所得都須課稅，收益稅沒有普照遍性，僅限於某幾種特定的收益而已。　收益稅征稅的手段是籠統的，它並不一定以凈收入爲標準，往往粗依總收益而逕定稅額。至所得稅須將當事人爲獲得此種收益而必需支付的各種費用及其他公課等扣除，而僅對他的凈剩所得課稅。此外，所得父常斟酌個人各種狀　而定不同的稅額，如獨身者與已婚者，無債者與負債者的區別等是。</p>
<p>中國所得稅問題的演進</p>
<p>所得稅旣係一種收入豐富，納稅普及負擔公平而富有伸縮力的合於時代的租稅，故現時各國大都早已實行，且成績日益進步，已占稅制中重要地位而爲財政收入的主要泉源。計股早的要算英國，於一七九八年業已開征；其决爲美國，開始於一八六二年；此外意德日等也都各在十九世紀下半相繼施行，僅法國較遲，於一九一叫年才决定採用所得稅，正式實行則在一九一六年。茲將各國實行開征所得稅時期及所得稅在總稅收中之白分比（以一九三二年爲準）列表於下：</p>
<p>至於中國，征收所得稅的聲浪，雖也從前淸末年就已喊起，民國以來父逐决制定條例，但直到眼前，除了對於政府所屬各機關的公務員征收畸形的黨部所得捐外，迄未見之正式實行。關於民國以來所得稅問題的演進情形，的可概說如後：</p>
<p>據查民國初年，財政部以國庫窘迫，曾决心籌辦所得稅，但屢議屢輟，始終沒有具體的計劃出現。至三年一月，好容易頒布了所得稅條例二十七條，並估計收入二，一七五，〇〇〇元，追補於民國二年度之預算內，但結果沒有行。四年八月，以原訂所得稅條例範圍太廣，手續又過於麻煩，深覺無法在同一時期內驟將各種所得全部開征，乃制定所得稅第一期施行細則，凖備分期推行，先從官吏議員及贏利較多之大商業等項着手，並决定前者用溯源方法征收，後者用申報方法征收，五年度預算數列入二，八三五，〇〇〇元，似已達具體的階段，不意最後終因國內紛擾之故，仍被擱淺。民八當局又覺第一期施行細則稅率太高，决定廢止，另訂先後征稅數額，交各省財政廳分別自行估認，並規定將所得稅欵充教育實業之用。十年一月，財部再公布所得稅條例施行細則，所得稅征收稅目，所得稅調查及審委會議事規程，所得稅征收規則，所得稅欵儲撥章程等，當時蘇浙魯鄂各省且都已認定數目，原擬於是月一日起實行，忽各省議會商會通電請求緩辦，乃展延三月，竟至於無期。</p>
<p>國民政府成立，征牧所得稅之議復起，十七年十月規定辦理所得稅之步驟，十八年一月財政部將民國三年之所得稅條例重加修正公布，並按修正條例之要點，復將以前所得稅施行細則分別改訂，但修正條例與細則公布後，却仍未達到實際的征收。只是有一件事情我們要注意的，那就是十六年起所實行的公務人員所得捐，計平均每月的可總收三十萬元左右；這的確已有類於所得稅制內的官吏所得稅，然而範圍畢竟太狹，且稅欵係充各地黨部之用，於中央財政收入不生關係，所以僅可認爲一種過渡的畸形的性質。</p>
<p>迨去年（二十四年）夏，政府當局終覺要健令財政與改良稅制，無論如何非開辦所得稅不可，乃再行參酌已往成案，草定了新的所得稅暫行條例，計共三十一條。當初，就預備從七月一日起實行，故二十四年度預算曾列入五百萬元；但旋决定延至本年一月一日　征；然而結果，竟到目前還仍在發論莫定。</p>
<p>那末，遲遲其行者，到底爲了甚麼原因呢？根據我們考求所獲，似大致不外於下列幾點；　政治的不統一　戶口調查的不完備　賬簿組繳以及其他技術上的欠缺　工商業的未發達　國內惡勢力的阻撓　外人的掣肘。</p>
<p>今後如何實行？</p>
<p>上述幾種阻碍，自然到現在還不曾完全克服，而且最近的將來，恐怕也未必極容易所可解消的。可是，我們終不能一直因循下去，如果呆板地死等一切條件都會目行具備，想期待一個毫無困難的時期，而不加努力推進，則無異守株待免，將永無實現的一日。</p>
<p>那來，如何實行呢？讓我們稍稍貢獻些意見：</p>
<p>課稅區域爲了國內政治上經濟上的拘束，以及調查工作之不易迅速完成，恐無法立刻同時實行全國統一的所得稅，則不妨變通辦法，分區　徵；或者先從東南幾省起始，具有試辦性質，隨時改進，逐漸擴大，最後推行到全國。但推行稈序愈快愈好，吾則將形成長期的不平，與省際逃稅的現象。鄙意以爲至多分叫期，每期以半年爲原則，二年後須普及全國。蓋旣歷二年之經騐各種手續當有相當頭緒，自較易於初創時期。其决，爲避免各省故意對中央之可能的掣肘，不妨將所得稅稅欵提成若干，撥交地方政府，俾收中央與地方合作之效。這雖與行政統一與稅收統一俱有未合，但在特殊情形之下，不得不認爲無辦法中暫時過渡的辦法。不過，倘使非常時期就在目前，則自不必再拘束於旣定分期程序，應運用非常時手段，立刻推進於全國各個地方。</p>
<p>課稅範圍在草創時期，各種條件欠缺，一時無法普遍到一切所得，而不得不逐種推行，這是對的。然而，在程序上則頗可硏究；最近所頒布的所得稅暫行條例，其規定範圍實在太狹：計第一類爲公司商號行棧工廠以及一時營利事業之所得，第二類爲薪給報酬之所得；這裹沒有圈入最重要的資產所得。資產所得中之地租房租等，因已有相當綦重的地方稅（如房捐田賦及其附加稅），故在未與各省商定妥善辦法以前，確應緩征所得稅（但對大地中可用超過所得稅）。然下列幾種所得，則必須同時課征的，而技術上也並非最困難，計：　公債利息所得　存欵利息所得　大企業股東紅利所得　大富豪之超過所得。如果這些所得都不征稅，則所得稅中一切優點如「征收普及」「負擔公平」「收入充分」「富有伸縮力」等，將盡歸消滅，更談不到作爲非常時期的種源了。</p>
<p>課稅方法因調查工作困難，並以課稅範圍一時不能遍及一切所得，故除征收超過所得稅外，中國自不能實施綜合課稅制度而應採行臬源課稅制度。至於行泉源所得稅時，課稅方法如何，我以爲不必拘泥於單純的種，宜擇便活用之：如薪給報酬所得，房租所得，可採「溯源法；」帳簿組織較完善的公司商號行棧工廠等所得，可採「申報法，」自由職業者所得地租所得等可採「外標推　法。」此外，征稅機關在可能範圍內不妨委托當地政府與已設的他種稅收機關代征或帶征，以省開支。</p>
<p>稅率　初創辦時，稅率目不宜過高但亦不宜過低，應予所得的大小以切合。所得稅條例第一類營利事業所得以百分之五起征尙妥，但資本標準定三千以上，似於小企業負擔太重，宜改爲五千元。第二類薪給報酬所得以六百元起征，似亦太有累於小所得，宜改爲一千元。至其起稅點均奉爲千分之十，尙屬適當，但累進率太低，對大所得最高的千分之二百，即使增加一倍，亦不會過苛。前述所謂資產所得稅與超過所得稅，根據重課不勞而獲的原則，更官提高稅率。總之，大所得者的負担務必加重，非常時期允然。至於有的主張納稅者個人環境如家庭負担之多寡，債務之有無等，課稅率應予差別，則因調查工作繁劇，初倡時期中國似暫不能顧及。</p>
<p>與他種租稅之關係薪給報酬所得實行後，現有各機關黨部所得捐應取消。田地房屋上之一切附加雜稅，應與各省當局商議减免，於短期內代以所得稅。營業稅等與所得稅衝突過甚者應調整之。此外，應與所得稅同時實行的，則爲遺產稅。</p>
<p>困難問題　照上述幾種辦法，技術上的困難尙在其次，最討厭的是國內惡勢力的阻撓與外人的制肘。蓋中國的所得，允其是資產所得者，直接間接多是具有勢力的人，他們對於累進率的程度，是多方使其减低，對於資產所得則必欲不在徵稅之範圍，近頒條例之所以累　率如是低，及未行列入資產所得者，他們的活動亦不無相當原因。至於外人的掣討，往往會產生逃稅漏稅甚至資金逃避的現象，其對於中國所得稅的前途，影響殊大。打破之道，但不是單純地從外交上所司全部消除的，現存關稅漏稅問題，尙且得不到解决，新辦的所得稅自必更多麻煩。所以要使中國所得稅進行順利，那這兩種障礙，非有澈底破除不可，然而不易，那末納稅的總不出無法逃避的小所得，焉能公平普遍。</p>
<p>總之，中國所得稅之必須開徵，已爲仟何人所不否認，問題乃在如何實行耳？至於所得稅與非常財政問題，我們自然不敢武斷地遽說徵收所得稅便可解决非常時財政困難。，但至少，所得稅對於非常財政之有甚大的補助，那是無可抹煞的事實吧。</p>
<h3 id="c175">遺產稅的檢討 <a href="#c175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— 曾雲</p>
<p>最近，財政部　債極計劃開徵所得稅與遺產稅，前者之條例，早經頒布，後者亦在革擬中，如無阻碍，便可實施。這當然是平衡國　收支上重要的一着，而况遺產稅爲近代私有財產制度下最合理最公平的良稅呀！照字面去講，所謂遺產稅，似乎很簡單的一回事，只要對某一人所遺下來的財產，課以若干稅額就是了。然而，實際上關於徵課手續以及　稅標準等等，却都非常複雜，正爲租稅中最不容易辦好的一種，稍或有所疏漏，就會產生不良的結果。</p>
<p>茲就遺產稅的本身言，有遺產總課與遺產分課之別；就徵稅的地域標凖言，父有依產（遺產所在地）依人（遺產人或繼承人所在地）依國籍之不同；就繼承人的對象言，有近親與遠親之分；更就稅率的準即言，有比例稅率與累淮稅率，而累進稅率中父有所謂全額累　與超額累進之異；此外，如稅級的劃分，免稅點以及免稅者的規定，都需要嚴密的考量與籌策。爲使明瞭遺產稅的內容起見，我們對於以上幾點，殊有略加敘述的必要。</p>
<p>遺產總課與遺產分課前者爲對於總遺產課稅，具有財產稅的性質；後者係依照遺產分配上各別課稅，屬不勞利得稅的性質。這兩種方法各有利弊，總課制可使財務行政上手續簡便，並得卽省徵收費用，而累進率相對的增高，免稅額絕對的减少，在稅收方面又可增加不少。但這對於遺產稅納稅羣中是含有不平的成分，因對總遺產上以同一標凖課稅，則受分較少者，實際受虧不少。反之，分課制則須分別規定免稅額之有無，累進率的高低，手續固繁，但就遺產繼承人階層的立塲視之，負担似較公平。現時各國，日德純採分課制（德國於一九一九年雖會創設總課制，但一九二二年後即行廢止，歸入分課制中），英法總分制並採，美國則總遺產稅屬聯邦，分遺產稅屬各州，至於單純採用總課制的，聞僅英屬哥倫比亞（British　Columbia）一地而已。</p>
<p>征稅之地域標凖　這是征收遺產稅上最感麻煩的問題，遺產授受的時候，常可碰到遺產人與繼承人分在各地的複雜狀態。因之，徵稅標準就很多，有的是依照遺產人之住址的，有的是依照繼承人之住址的，有的是依照遺產人之國籍的，有的則以遺產之所在地爲標準的，而關於遺產人及繼承人的住址，各地解說，往往各不相同，故常有發生重複微牧的事實。有時，對於同一財產，甲地亦徵，乙地亦徵，甚至丙地亦徵。此種現象允以美國爲最多，美國各州法令關於地域的解釋並不一律，所以有時遇產產人在甲州，繼承人在乙州，而遺產却在丙州的場合，甲乙丙三州竟可同時各按其所定稅率課稅。至於單以遺產所在地爲標準　，確屬明白得多，但亦並非絕無問題，醫如有人遺　某種公司的股票，而該公司則在幾處地方都有財產的，那末情形也就複雜了。此外，因國際間立法不同，常無法避免遺產稅的重課現象；此項困難，目下各國雖均努力想設法消除它，但終以國際問恊調未能普遍與澈底，迄無可靠辦法。</p>
<p>遺產人與繼承人的親疏關係現時各國遺產稅稅率，大都是依照遺產人與繼承人間關係的親疏，而定稅率的高下，遠親者終比近親者被徵較多。它們認爲近親是應得的，遠親則係偶然的。計法國分十一等，英國分五等，而日本則更有家長繼承和一般繼承的區別，家長繼承的稅率是比一般繼承爲輕。以上所謂分等徵稅的辦法，在遺產稅納稅者階層間，其準確與公平，自然無可非議：不過，它也不能不有相當的缺點，即手續方面實在太覺麻煩了，因爲有了親疏的區分，　免稅額標準問題，累進率高低問題等等，便都非另行再各別規定不可。而尙有可能發生弊端的，則爲增多狡黠者的逃稅。譬如，遠親者應得的遺產，常可先由近親者的名義代爲出面，以輕稅率。</p>
<p>稅率的標準要使稅率恰當，這又是一樁繁重的工作。稅率所　據的標準，大致有下述數項：　遺產稅的大小；即按遺產數額的多寡，區分若干級，每級分別訂定不同的稅率，大致係採累進方法而遞增的，並規定了一個最低點和最高點。　遺產　與繼承人的親疏關係；如上述，有的也有依據親疏程度，而區分爲若干等不同的稅級。　子女的有無或多寡；這大概係跟着獎勵人口的社會政策下所特殊發展的，法國的遺產稅法令中，便有按子女的有無及多寡而異其稅率，子女四人者，甚至可以免徵總遺產稅。　此外父有所謂以遺產周轉决數而定稅率之高下的，如意大利人里湼諾（E.Rignano）主張遺產第一次繼承　稅率最輕，第二次第三次……則遂步增高。但道種辦法近於一種理想，事實上困難點很多，所以尙無採行的國家。因第一，繼承後原有財產與新添財產容易混同，而無法再加以正確辨明；第二，先前繼承人或將故意消耗繼承所得項下的原有財產；第三，財產價格變動無定，將影響以後的納稅關係。至於英國人但登（Daton）等主張預納辦法，即第一决繼承人除繳納其本來應負的遺產稅外，再預納第二决繼承的稅額，在該第二次繼承尙未實行以前，由國家每年給與相當利息；這雖然已經比較具體些，但也如不容易辦妥吧。</p>
<p>全　累　與超額累進一般的說米，徵稅本有比例稅率與累准稅率之分，不過遺產稅徵稅方法，終是屬於累進的。這是因爲直接稅的遺產稅，係不勞利得的性質，惟有以累進稅率徵收之，才見眞正公平。但累進方法中又有全額累進（英，德等採之）與超額累進（法，日，美等採之）之分，兩者優劣互見，全額累進手續較簡，收入較多，惜當有不公平的現象；超額累進則反之。舉例：甲之遺產數額爲二萬　，稅率百分之一，故應繳稅額爲二百元，實存一萬九千八百元；乙之遺產數額爲二萬零十元，稅率百分之一·五，如照金額累進計算，應繳稅額爲三百元零一角五分，實存一萬九千六百九十九元八角五分，後者實存數反比前者爲少。但　超額累進徵收則不然，即二萬零十元中之　萬元是照百分之一稅率算，稅額二百元，僅十元項下照百分之一·五算，稅額一角五分，合計二百元零一角五分，可實存一萬九千八百零九兀八角五分。</p>
<p>稅之範圍關於免稅範圍的規定，其標準大致有下列幾項：（一）依遺產數額而定：即是由法律規定一個免稅的標凖點，不滿某一數額者免稅，超過某一數額者開始按率征稅。其實行手段父可分爲多種：有的規定凡遺產額超過所定的免稅點時，即按全部遺產課稅，不再扣除原有免稅額（日德等採之），有的僅將超過部分課稅，如遺產額爲四千元，免稅點爲三千元，則僅對該超過部分之一千元課稅，而將三千元除外（美法等採之）。又有所謂遞减免稅法（Vanishing　eremption），如原定免稅點爲三千元，但若超過一元即遞减一元，此時之免稅額成爲一千九百九十九元，應納稅的遺產爲二元，迨超過額達三千元時，（即遺產額爲六千元時），即將免稅額取銷，對六千元全部課稅（南非聯邦等採之）。（二）依遺產繼承人的性質叫定；如果遺產是贈給慈善以及其他公共事業的，普通多屬免稅、（三）依子女多寡而定；此爲一國社會政策下特殊的待遇，如法國爲獎勵人口起見，對於子女較多者是例外地給與减稅或免稅的優待的。（四）依遺產人的性質而定；即對於陸海空軍陣亡或因戰地服務受傷致死之人員，其遺產均免課稅。</p>
<p>遺產之對象　遺產的種類可包括一切不動產動產之土地，房屋，存貨，現金，存欵，放欵，票據，應收賬欵，應收利息，以及代表財產利　或營業利益的憑證商業，專利權，商標權，版權等。但征稅時慶除　遺產人的債務，未付押欵，應付各項租稅。公課，保險費，喪葬費，管理暨分配遺產與執行遺囑等之必要費用，以及意外損失等等。至於未成年繼承人的敎育費是吾應行除去，則視各國敎育政策而異。</p>
<p>以上各點，俱爲討論遺產稅問題上必須明瞭的重要節目；至如何實施，那自然沒有一定的機械的標準，須唬各國實際情形而斟酌之。</p>
<p>現在，我們進而來看遺次財政部所草定的遺產稅條例草案，綜合各章各條內容，可得最主要幾點如下：</p>
<p>（一）捨分課制而採總課刷；</p>
<p>（二）課稅不分繼承之親疏；</p>
<p>（三）征稅標準於國內採遺產所在地，於國外採國籍；</p>
<p>（四）免稅點定爲三千元，但政院審查後改爲五千元：</p>
<p>（五）稅率採超額累進制，最低百分之一，最高百分之二十四，但超過一千萬元者，增百萬兀之額課百分之五；</p>
<p>組織遺產審查委員會；遺裏　將上述六點的略來檢討一下吧：</p>
<p>分課制與總課制的優劣已是上述，但中國應採取的，的確暫以總課制爲宜，至　目前中國財務行政技術落後，自應避免苛細；　中國財產制度與遺囑制度尙未普遍，分課制之征收手續太覺繫複；　中國尙無財產稅，如邋行分課制，在程序上似太見突進，且總課制可兼盡財產稅的任務。不過，無論採總課制抑分課制，健全的戶口制度乃爲必要的前提，如果中國淸查戶口未能精密完成，則有碍遺產稅的征收，是極其深重的。</p>
<p>遺產本來係不勞利得，實際上乃無所謂應得或偶得。所以，征稅時對於繼承的親疏關係，確可不必區分。且如上述，中國財務行政技術未會健全，這些繁劇的區分工作，是難以勝任的。猶其將來多生種種弊端，如隱匿逃稅等等；母寗捨繁就簡爲佳。</p>
<p>征稅標凖屛除住址，而於國內採遺產所在地，國外採國籍：確如條例草案中所說明，具有、兼採屬人屬地二者之長」的優點，可以避免各地互岐的弊端，然而尙有未行明示而成爲疑問的，即如前述關於在幾處地方都有財產的公司股票等，究竟以那一地方爲標準呢？此外，對於在華外人遺產的征稅，能吾順利進行，恐怕還是一個問題吧。</p>
<p>不論三千元或五千元之免稅點，在原則上誠屬折中，但就目前中國人民財產分布狀態血論，要否再加斟酌，是另一問題，惟求成年繼承人的教育費是否應行扣除，而在免稅之列條例草案中未見說明，在鄙見以爲中國免費敎育旣未行普及，似應酌加扣除。</p>
<p>超額累進率較爲公平，確屬無可否認；但鄙意以爲不必機械地完全一律，遺產額絞大的，似毋庸給與此種優待。凡十萬元以上可改用全額累進率，十萬元以下者仍用超進率，即兼採全額累進制與越額累進制。至於累進的比率，所定亦覺太低，不妨略再增高，希望立法當局於審查時詳加硏究之。</p>
<p>審查委員會爲必需的機關，但其工作實屬非常繁劇；如果對於調查評價的工作漏，不僅將影響政府稅收，且常會產生的現象。允其是土地，房屋，商譽，專利權，商標權，版權等的估價，更覺不易。此外，審查委員會與納稅者通同舞弊，也是很可能的。</p>
<p>總之，遺產稅　租稅中之最佳者，但亦最不容易辦得精密周到，中國遺產稅方値草創，所遇困難必允多。現在我們提出最低限度的希望：　稅率不太低：　調查評價務求準確，　絕對防杜舞弊與逃稅；　肅淸一切不合理的阻撓，從早實施；　征稅所得，用之於正當建設及敎育事業。最後，父不得不重行提示者，倘使淸查戶口不能完密做到，則征收遺產稅的成績，恐怕難以樂觀吧？</p>

<p>— 潘公展</p>
<p>兼弱攻昧，取亂侮亡，這是中國古代的成語；物競天擇，優勝劣敗，這是近代社會進化的學說。物腐蟲生，在科學上雖然是不合邏輯，在意義上却有相當的至理。所以一個人在社會上要有相當的地位，要能自立而不被淘汰，基本的條件，就是要努力，奮鬥，而沒有被人家攻擊的弱點；則自己不能振作，而徒相僥倖生存，苟延殘喘，終有自趨於失敗的一日，個人如此，國家民族，亦復如此。</p>
<p>近代國家的强盛，决不是有賴於少數人的努力奮鬥，而是全國廣大的優秀人民所造成。從前的政權，集中在少數人或者是皇帝手裏，如少數人或者皇帝是賢明的，國家民族隨時就可强盛，因爲絕對多數的人民是不識不知而是聽一人或少數人所指揮。如其皇帝或少數人是昏昧庸懦，則國家民族也就隨之衰弱，歷史上所記載的歷代興亡以及民族盛衰的事蹟，大都總逃不了這種的原因。可是近代國家的政權，都是操在大多數人民的手裏，國家民族的命運，是决於構成國家民族每個份子的優劣。如其組織的份子不良，則整個的組織，亦决不會健全。譬如人體，細胞不健全，何能望其全身達於健康的地步？德國在歐戰期中，雖然一收塗地，然未過二十年，復造成歐洲今日之地位，說對都謂希特拉的堅苦卓絕，纔能使德國復興，但此不過皮毛的觀察，若無德意志優秀之民族爲後盾，則希特拉手握政權，不過數年，縱具有天賦才智，堅苦意志，又焉能使一蹶不振之德意志民族在最短時期內復躋於歐洲列强之林呢？</p>
<p>中國自鴉片戰爭以後，多數人民沉浸於烟氛毒霧之中者，將近百年。在這百年當中，也不知埋沒了許多上進的靑年，也不知葬送了許多有爲的志士，個人的傾家蕩產，民族精神的萎靡不振、莫不由於烟毒的原因。在民國初年，中間雖曾嚴禁數次，終以禁者未具决心，吸者未明利害，以致烟毒蔓延，區域日廣，從前所吸者僅及於鴉片一種，後來目變本加厲，紅丸嗎啡，逐漸普遍。飯可不吃，而烟與毒不能脫離；稻可不種，而罌粟不能不栽。吸烟吸毒者，固直接受害，而不吸食烟毒者，亦間接大受其影響。長此以往，中國即不受侵略，亦必自趨於減亡；列强即不來分割，我們也决不能自存。以如此腐化不長進的民族，而欲在一十世紀的舞臺，與自强不息的，優秀民族相角逐，决無倖存之理。人必自侮而後人侮之，國必自伐，而後人伐之，烟毒蔓延，已等於整個民族自殺，不獨無復興的希望，且將永淪於萬刦不復的地位。波蘭亡國，尙可復興；土耳其爲近東病夫，亦能振拔，然其復興與振拔的原因，均由於人民鑒於亡國的痛苦，生聚敎訓，故能在歐戰以後，一躍而晚離列强的束縛。設使全國多數人民，均染有烟毒，昏沉迷惘，卽有機會，又何能自救呢？林則徐所謂十年之後無可用之兵，無可使之民，處現在國祭情勢之下，不待十年，國家民族，早爲他人所宰割。現今列强方才整軍經武，秣馬厲兵，以預備第二决世界大戰的來臨，重行分割殖民地，我國有大好的河山，强鄰久已耽耽虎視，若我們再不求上進，力圖目拔，則帝國主義者更可假借文明的幌子，鯨呑蠶食了。</p>
<p>中國現在已到生死存亡最後的關頭，國家民族的復興，也就靠我們最後努力的成績如何。但是民族如何才能復興，其中雖然有種種的條件，而最低限度，先要剷除亡國減種的烟毒。蔣委員長訂了三年禁毒六年禁烟的計劃，嚴厲實施，實在是救亡的惟一要圖。因爲烟毒一日不除，中國民族將永無復興的希望；烟毒一日不凈；中國民族將永淪於黑暗的地獄。烟毒是銷沉壯志的惡魔，姻毒是頹廢精神的工具，烟毒是束縛思想的縲絏，烟毒是斫傷身體的利器。吸食烟毒，不獨自身受其害，且將遺害於子孫。所以我們爲個人前途努力計，爲將來子孫發展計，爲整個民族生存計，不能不嚴厲的剷除烟毒，不能不堅决的戒除烟毒！</p>
<h3 id="c179">過去半年內本局辦理禁烟之槪况 <a href="#c179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— 蔡勁軍</p>
<p>查鴉片爲害人人皆知自遜淸末季遞及民國數十年來，莫不詳定刑章，懸爲厲禁，顧究其實際，成效未著，流毒愈烈，此其故何哉，蓋亦施禁不得其法耳，本市爲中外通商巨埠，全國交通總樞，人口稠密，商業繁盛，市民習於奢靡沉湎嗜好者頗多，而不法之徒利用交通便利與警權之不統一，密設製造或儲藏窟穴，運輸販賣，以圖私利，非亟謀肅淸，非特一隅之害，亦且影響全國禁政之推行，我市長對於本市烟毒之禁絕，極爲重視，而其有澈底肅淸之决心，勁軍職掌公安，奉命兼管禁政，半年以來，成績未著，深用目愧，茲承禁烟拒毒宣傳調籌備會徵文，謹將本局辦理禁烟經過概况略叙於　，</p>
<p>長以我國烟毒爲害之深。斷非短期內所能禁絕，是以本總理遺訓决定禁烟方案，製定六年禁烟計劃，頒佈限期禁絕各項法令，督飭各省市努力推行，本局於二十四年七月奉令實施禁烟方案，即以烟民登記爲第一步工作，查禁種禁運禁售，必以禁吸爲前提，烟民登記所以求得烟民吸量之總數，製成統計，爲分年遞减及統制種運售三者之標準，故登記務求普遍，吸量統計務求精確，有精確之烟民及吸量統計，乃能規定每年遞减之標凖，遞减之標凖數旣定，乃能統制鴉片之產額及運售數量，蓋烟民逐漸减少，鴉片產量與運售亦當比例减少，迨烟民完全戒絕，則種運售三者，自應完全禁絕使種運售吸四者連帶禁絕，步驟井然，實較以前施禁爲法良意美，可操券以待也。</p>
<p>故本局辦理禁政之始，工作重心完全側重烟民登記，計自二十四年七月開始至十二月止，共計登記烟民二萬　八三三人，茲列表如左：</p>
<p>在上列表中，本市烟毒最重區域，爲老北門警察所所轄境內，次之爲邑廟警察所，最輕爲市中心區，此爲最可注意之一點，蓋凡接近鄕村之區，其烟毒較輕，而人烟稠密之區域，則烟毒較重，所以造成此種現象之社會原因殊値得吾人之硏究也，至於登記烟民以年齡統計四十歲至五十歲爲最多，三十至四十歲决之，三十歲至五十歲爲人生最重要時期，正建立事業之際，因習染嗜好，致使有用之才，無形廢棄，其影響於社會國家爲何如耶，茲將烟民年齡之統計列後；</p>
<p>年齡　人數</p>
<p>二十歲以下　一七</p>
<p>二十一歲至三十歲　二二四八　　三十一歲至四十歲　九四六八</p>
<p>四十一歲至五十一歲　九四三七</p>
<p>五十一歲至六十歲　六六二八　　六十一歲至七十歲　二六九八</p>
<p>七十一歲至八十歲　三一五　　八十歲至九十歲　二二</p>
<p>登記烟民之主旨在得烟民之總數，及吸量總數已如上述，在本局烟民吸量分組統計之結果以每日吸食一錢至二錢者爲最多，二錢至三錢决之，每日吸食在一兩以上者，亦二十六人之多，總計登記燜民爲三〇八三三人，每日耗費上膏須六三七三·八三二雨，平均每人須二錢餘，若每兩土膏，以二元計算，則每日須洋一萬二千七百四十七兀餘，每年消耗的須四百五十萬元，此係第一次登記烟民之吸量及其實際數目尙不止此，此項巨量金額消費於呑雲吐霧之中，影響於國計民生又爲如何耶，此尙就直接之消耗而言，至於農田因種植鴉片，而减少種食生產，以致外國糧食源源入口，流出巨量金錢，其間接損失允不可以推計，故雅片之害不除，國家經濟，農村生產，必受其打擊，而無此挽救，就經濟立場言，禁烟問題之重大可想而知矣。</p>
<p>限期戒烟執照，分貧民與普通二種，在本局具領普通執照之男子，爲一〇，三八七人，女子爲二，四五一人，共計一二，八三八人，領貧民執照之男子爲一五，三六四人，女子爲二，六三一人，共計爲一七，九九五人，兩相比較，領貧民執照者，超過領普通執照者，五千餘人，就常理言，吸食鴉片，非有資財者不能負祖，貧民力作所入，以資事蓄尙虞不足，安有餘財供無謂之消耗，而事實表現，貧民染有嗜好比較富有者爲多，其原因何在，又足資吾人之研究也。</p>
<p>本市本局所轄境內，人口統計共二百〇一一萬八千一百十四人，登記之烟民與人口之比例，爲百分之一，五，其未經登記及自動戒絕者與吸烟被捕送院勒戒烟民，尙不在其內，據木市特業公會估計，本市烟民當有十二萬人，是遵章登記者不過全數烟民三分之一，若依照特業公會之估計數目，則木市烟民與人口之比例，至少有百分之五四即每百人中，至少有烟民五人，現在檢舉烟民登記辦法，業已頒佈，在檢舉烟民期內，准許補行登記，則將來登記烟民增加，烟民爲人口之比例當有變更，故此項比例現時尙未能確定也。</p>
<p>本局自去年七月起十二月止送各戒烟醫院施戒烟民共計四千三百〇四人，其中在滬南戒烟醫院戒除者男一一六七人，女二八叫人，滬北戒烟醫院戒除者男二一三四人，臨時戒毒所戒除者男二五三人，女三二人，人犯戒烟醫院戒除者男三六三人，女七一人，而本局會同衛生局指定擔任戒烟醫院戒絕人數，尙不在內，試分析烟民戒烟踴躍之原因，固由一部份烟民對於政府禁烟政策有澈底之了解，因而翻然覺悟，然亦因本市戒烟完全免費，故自願報戒者有之，其另一部份，則凛於禁烟治罪暫行條例科刑之嚴厲，因而自動請戒者亦有之，但在吾人之觀點，如果烟民對於政府禁烟政策，能有確切認識與了解，固可欣慰，即其因懼罪而請戒，亦足嘉許也，故吾人對於烟民請戒之踴躍，實爲禁烟前途致其無窮之希望。</p>
<p>關於二十四年鴉片烟案之查獲，因本局厲行查緝，故破獲案件，亦較歷年爲多，自去年一月起，至十二月終止，共破獲私吸案件，二二一五起，其中初犯人數男三九八一人，女四九〇人，再犯人數男九人，三犯人數女一人，共計男三九九〇人，女叫九一人，查獲鴉片六五二，二七兩。破獲私售案件計一一一起，男犯一二八人，女二四人，查獲鴉片一四九，五兩。破獲私運案件計三六起，男四四人女四人，查獲鴉片二四九五，三六兩。破獲私設烟館一六六起，男犯二四一人，女三三人，查獲鴉片九一，九四兩，在上述統計數字中，考察獲案數目以私吸案件爲最多，可見一般烟民對於禁烟法令，尙未盡悉，此殆由於國民敎育根基薄弱之故，至私售案件在去年七月以前破獲者計一〇一件，七月以後破獲者一零件，於數字上觀察，可知關於私售案件之查緝，已較七月以前嚴密，使售私之徒，不敢再以此爲生，因之私售案之破獲，較前大减，此吾人深以爲欣慰者。</p>
<p>以上所述爲本局推行禁政概况，限於篇幅，詳舉靡遺，至最近本局工作，側重於檢舉烟民登記，在檢舉期內，准許烟民補行登記，此係政府寬大爲懷予烟民以自新之機，惟限期售　三月，希望未經登記之烟民，速行投局聲請登記，毋誤良機，致蹈　綱，勁軍不敏，推行禁政未能盡善，敬乞社會人士予以指止，俾禁烟工作之推進更著成效，以期如限完成，不特勁軍個人之幸，抑亦國家民挨之福也。</p>

<h3 id="c180">阿比西尼亞沒有失敗？ <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— 劍平</p>
<p>歷時半年有多的意帝國主義侵阿戰爭，到了現在因爲阿比西尼亞孤立無助，而意軍也因用各種非法的殘酷的戰術，得到節節勝利了。戰訊已被證實的，阿比西尼亞的台西城已被意軍攻陷，幷向阿京加緊推進，可知意阿戰爭，已到了最後關頭了。但是，處在這個歐洲和遠東局面非常尶尬的時侯，帝國主義關係更趨複雜，大家已極願意阿戰爭早日停息，甚至不惜犧牲被侵略的弱小民族以討好意帝國。因此，曾經掙紅臉孔力主對意大利制裁的國際聯盟，也改轉談鋒於「意阿議和問題」了。由此，我們更可以淸楚地看到帝國主義的眞面目。</p>
<p>不過，議和問題在野心勃勃正在不斷勝利的意帝國主義是未能心滿意足的。因此，十六日的十三國會議中，意代表提出議决的先决條件——一，阿軍解除武裝，表示降服。二，黜廢阿王。三，意軍進佔阿京。四，自法國屬地直布底港通至阿京的鐵道，當由意軍特別加以監督。換一句話說：意帝國非至滅了阿比西尼亞不願議和。這樣亡國的條件，英勇抗敵的阿比西尼亞當然不能承認的。阿代表團的「斷然拒絕」是意想中的事。而十三國會議也只好宣告和議失敗了。</p>
<p>和議失敗了以後，當然的路向便是意帝國主義更積極更殘酷的向阿京進攻了，帝國主義的侵略戰爭，是不惜用一切非法的戰術的，而阿京的危殆也是必然的了。可是，英勇抗敵的阿比西尼亞是不會屈服的，他們的戰爭不會因爲暴力而停止。阿京十七日電謂：阿政府於必耍時遷都於阿京西一百二十五英哩的比羅地方。由此我們可以看見阿國抗敵的决心。這一决阿比西尼亞的戰敗，我們也認爲是光榮的，勝利的。因爲一件事的成敗是不能以暫時的勝敗下結論的。</p>

<p>— 白玲</p>
<p>—嶗山脚下—</p>
<p>在陽光和煦的照耀中，那一隻灰色的海圻軍艦，離開靑島棧橋，踏着穩靜的藍色的海面，沿着一串連綿不斷的山前浮滑着。</p>
<p>春天的海是美的。春天的靑島的山也是美的。</p>
<p>經過了一段不遠的海程，那高高的聳入雲霧里的糢糊的嶗山之巔，有如一座大的古墓出現了。</p>
<p>小的山，環繞着，起伏着。</p>
<p>從軍艦上放下來的只能容二十人的一隻一隻小的艇子，開始奔忙着向着岸上的石岩跟前划送着。</p>
<p>灣曲的，羊腸似的，平坦的山道上，一隊不整齊的，高的，低的，穿着淺藍色制服的我們在爬動着。直朝着華巖寺走去了。</p>
<p>在華巖寺休息過之後，我們便分散開。</p>
<p>這時，我和着三個同學，興奮地胡跳着。逛完了較近的幾個名勝的地方，我們實在有些疲倦了，脚步再沒有力量去跋踄了。我們朝着一個小的山村一步一步的走去。這個山村只有五家人家，矮小的房屋，都是用凹凸不平的黃色的石塊壘成的，屋頂是舖蓋着茅草。在這山村的週圍是一片山，左邊是廣大的海，但沒有一方田地。處處是現着荒凉的景象。</p>
<p>我們站在這山村的一家屋後頭。我們見不到一個人影。糾着「咯咯」的雞，三五成羣的在山坡上亂抓着。山村是靜的。</p>
<p>忽然，從村南的那條小道上，走過一個三十多歲的男人來，這男人的臉子是長長的，有點發黃。他沒有帶帽子，腦袋是光禿的。他身上穿着一伴舊藍布大褂，看模樣是一個不勞動的人。他走近我們跟前，向我們瞟了一眼，沒有停脚步，就慌忙的走進一個院子里。我們剛想離開這個村子，突然，一陣暴躁的駡聲，從剛才那個男入進去的院子里透送出來：娘個×，你天大的膽!」接着是女人的哭聲。院子變做不安了。一個最多不過三十歲的男人從院子跑出來，他被我們所遇見的那個男人追趕着。他一邊跑一邊回頭望。但在他屁股後追他的那個人，一邊追一邊這麼罵：「我×你祖宗的，你再來我給你敲斷了狗腿……」他像被什麼感動似的，再沒有往前追，馬上停下腿，轉身就往院子跑。一進院，他提高了嗓子：「我問你，我問你，你再敢不敢？」拳頭好像在女子的身上掄。女人哀求的，直着喉嚨：「我，我，我再不敢了……」</p>
<p>男人又是打：「嘿，把你娘的……要你幹什麼，你眞耍氣死我了！你天大的膽，我不在家你偸着和人家……我揍你，揍你，你和人家多少决了？你說，你說？」</p>
<p>女子抽搐哭：「我，我，就三次……」停了一回：「你也得想想，你不管我，你在外頭和人家的女人胡勾塔，三月兩月不來家一回，我吃什麼？你看人家的男人，多麼能出力，誰像你……春天暖和和的，人家都上山去找生意做，你沒看見這幾天山上多熱鬧，靑島的老爺，太太，少爺，小姐們都來逛山，你不好找個伴，抬着山轎上山去看看……你不學好，還來駡我，打我，我，我，我是被逼得沒有辦法，我才……」</p>
<p>男人沒說一句話。半天，他：「你娘那個臭×，你沒權干我的事，我揍你，你，你，他給你多少錢？你說，你說，拿出來……</p>

<p>— 徐疾</p>
<p>夜烏里而深沈，在街的遠遠的盡頭騰起了如烟的濃霧，風不息地捲括一依　是那麼尖峭而凜冽，細雨像灰塵那樣地，靜靜的落下……</p>
<p>街袒着烏黝而光亮的平面，行人問歇地一個兩個地行過，街是廣闊爾寬大，在一角裏，幽暗的燈光照在一所房子的門廊上，隱隱地，顯露了幾個被年代所剝蝕了的字跡：「宵嬰堂」。</p>
<p>（育嬰堂！在那兒，人從幼小的時候起，就不斷地遭受着苦難的命運的，忘記了人問的愛與歡笑的，蘊蓄着無窮的生之梅恨的……）</p>
<p>於是，從細雨中，從街的遠處，一條破殘的黑影飄來了：搖幌着，糢糊而無力……</p>
<p>在細雨與濃霧的夜之街頭，這一會，他眞的鼓着勇氣向上這兒來了！前一向，他曾獨個兒一决兩决地上這兒來探望過，探望着一些什麼，籌思着一些什麼，决定着一些什麼——可是，這一回，眞的，却不再是他孤獨的一個了，而是二個！二個啊！（他望一望懷抱裏的單薄的小生命，是的，現在，是二個人了！）</p>
<p>抖動着手，一次次地望着在臂灣裏沈睡着的小生命，裹在破殘的被絮中，呼着輕微得像黃昏的微風一樣的鼻息，這，帶着一種强頑的使人痙攣的生之意志：這牛命終於到世界上來了：誰也沒有權力再去左右它的生命，然而，入難道也有權力把它放進悲慘的命運裏去嗎？那號哭，那扭動，那嬰兒的酣睡的姿態……</p>
<p>望一望育嬰堂牆上的那隻烏黑的大抽屜，猛地像觸了害似的，混身抖動起來了：那裏，將埋葬了一個人底永世的命運；那裏，將埋葬了一個靈魂的永世的歡笑：那兒，是墳墓，是可怕的呑食人們底幼年之歡笑的血口……</p>
<p>在夜的冷風中，眼淚疎疎地落下了：想起幾個鐘點以前的年輕的妻的悲哭，心裏是像在絞着似的——一陣罪孽的悔恨深深地刺在心裏，慘痛，憎恨；「爲什麼呢？爲什麼在生活的面前，連一個小生命之出生都成了最大的犯罪呢？爲什麼入與人之間的熱情應當受到那麼殘酷，不可恕的，慘痛的刑罰呢……？）</p>
<p>毁滅，把那個悲慘的小小的生命毁滅了吧的這樣，也許能爲它結束了所有的人間的苦痛；然而，想自己，又有什麼權力去讓它死亡呢，「也許，會長大起來；也許，會把世界的命運改變一下的；也許……」</p>
<p>那麼想着，心頭漸漸地變得開朗而冷靜了，迷茫在細雨中已有好一會，冷風吹着單薄的衣衫，身上也給淋濕了。打了一個寒噤，把臂灣中的小生命再緊緊地把一把，輕輕地懺悔着：「孩子，在生活面上，你要原諒我們呀！」於是，敏捷地走到牆角，抽開大抽屜，把孩子颯的放了進去，一下子，一條單身的影子在街的那邊溜了去，街上是烏黑而靜寂大抽屜的警鈴「檔」的響了一聲，接着，裏面的「接嬰處」的人們便習慣地把那個孩子取了出來：「呀，又是一個！得登記呀！」</p>
<p>登記員在簿子上一筆一筆的登記，一筆一筆的决定着一個人的未來的命運……</p>
<p>夜是冷冽而潮濕，而離人的眼淚却乾了。</p>
<h3 id="c183">子明先生 <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— 石風</p>
<p>春天的陽光溫和地晒着子明先生底灰白色的頭髮，兩隻發光的眼鏡框，寂寞地反射出微弱的銀光，手里托着一冊殘破了的書籍，頭晃晃地讀着。眼鏡框也就動呀動地反着光。</p>
<p>眼睛已經花了。甚至戴上老花眼鏡看書還不得勁兒。不光這，身體也像弓背一樣地彎曲了，當他站起來的時侯，個子顯得小小的，皮膚發着棕色，他像一個木雕的干巴老頭兒！只是，他有些動作二雖然那些動作有些笨拙。有時，他還孩子氣很重地回想着練習一下過去的動作，那也不過使自己或旁人笑一笑就是了。</p>
<p>他老了。像他手裏的殘破的書籍一樣。……</p>
<p>那些籍寂寞地陪着他過了一生，從很年輕他就很愛書籍，家裏沒有錢買書，就借別人的。——那是時常遭到拒絕或白眼的事。他的母親也不知道上了誰的當，把自己辛苦地獲得交給孩子去讀書，她希望他在將來一定會撈過本錢來的。眼見他把四書讀完了，經書也讀完了，就在那時改了制；他免費進了當地的高等師範，從那裏出來是可以當敎席的。敎席，是怎樣高貴的職業呀！</p>
<p>在學校裏他愛上了繪畫。尤其是中國畫裏的山水畫。這並不是說他就專來學畫了，他還照樣地學着別種功課。由於母親的催促和自己的努力，他的功課超過別人的水準，山水畫更引人注意。</p>
<p>所以當他畢業以後，職業沒發生什麼大問題就通過了。他選擇了家鄉的一處中學和小學的職務。他常說，一個人是該給養育自己的家鄉出些力的。雖然那力不一定大，甚至對家鄕沒什麼好處。</p>
<p>在學校裏，學生們對他表示着敬愛。他也像愛着自己的孩子似的，指導着學生們。</p>
<p>允其是他的畫，多少人來求；有一個時代，內戰接連的發生着，子明先生的家鄕沒有法子逃出這大的漩渦，今天剛剛換了縣長，明天還不知道誰來長縣；就在那時代，他的畫却更加風頭了：縣長們一定要他畫，作爲一個紀念。我們知道，一個縣長到任時，那些當地紳士們都去把結他，他們就來求子明先生帮忙，畫一幅，隨便地畫一幅，來「紀念」一下兒。誰知道許允以後，他的名聲就大起來了呢？這個學校請他，那個學校的他，那些下了野的縣長們也辦起學校來了，更火熱地來的請他。</p>
<p>他是一個讀書人，那種士大夫氣味是很重的，對於這些的請，他都想辦法拒絕了，他不出家鄉的門，他願意給地方服務。</p>
<p>待後，孩子長大了，母親年老了，他更沒法出動，就死守在家里。</p>
<p>眼看年老了。在一個秋天，他又害了一塲大病，病好了以後，他的身體瘦弱的像幾根高粱稭扎的草人一樣，簡直沒有什麼肉了。在這時，他决定了不再做下去，在家修養一下，將來畫一點畫，換點錢生活。可是那些敬愛他的學生們又不允許他的吿退，而且，空著課等待他的到校。這樣的舉動眞感激得他流下淚來，扶着病體去上課了。</p>
<p>在課堂上，他坐在預備好的椅子上，講講書，然而，不能支持到下課，他一方面用手絹擦着流下的汗！雖然是冬天，流得很厲害。一面宣佈了下課。</p>
<p>病後的勞動使他的病又恢復了原狀，好像還重些。</p>
<p>現在，他又好了。但是，他像一個失去了知覺的人似的，每天在家看看書，指導一下孩子們的功課。那孩子又像他一樣地喜愛畫畫，他曾經說，將來一定要像子明先生一樣地努力地。子明先生對於孩子的話，只是苦笑着，用垂死的低音說：</p>
<p>——不要學習我吧，我是沒用處的。</p>
<p>談着，他放下殘破的書，像恢復了靑年的神氣，改着孩子的畫。</p>

<p>— 之爾</p>
<p>演員的保障（上）</p>
<p>最近訪問了一次夏佩珍小姐，在其他方的談話之外，她很叙說了些以前拍戲時所受苦處，例如拍「血債」的時候，她說一丈多高的機關上直摜下來，跌得昏了過去，又如拍「女兒經」的時候，在嚴冷的冬天的淸晨，幾决三番的受十幾個自來水罷頭冲，冲得她哭旣不能，笑也笑不出來。（戲裏是應該笑的。）</p>
<p>而最近，藝華公司拍「父子英雄」，有一位叫王仲康的演員，也從高的丈餘的佈景上跌下來，跌得不能動彈，據說也非得在醫院裏住三個月不可。</p>
<p>拍戲時爲了逼眞起見，一個演員需要絕對的服從導演，從高處跌下，或在冷水中冲淋，一决不足，繼以二次三次，或甚至四次、五次，那是應該的。不過，徐了認眞之外，在一個鏡頭完畢之後，或是在重拍之前，對於演員的身體，應該非常週密的加以保護，那也是必需的，例如演員在冷水中冲淋之後，立刻應該給他喝一盃白蘭地或共他却寒的東西，使他不致受寒成病，又例如拍從高處跌下的戲（即使戲裏並不要跌下，而爲了預防失足起見），在底下也應該有防止跌下受傷的設備，以免演員有意外的損傷。而在道些必需的設備之外，應該有一位經常的醫藥顧問來診察演員的身體，那也是並不苛刻的要求。這不僅是「亡羊補牢」的事情，也是「防患未遂」的事情。——至於所需的一切醫藥費用，應該由公司當局來担負，那自然也是大經地義的。</p>

<h3 id="e4">Tianjin Newspaper Publishes Bizarre News: Regardless of Whether the Hebei-Chahar Committee Receives Customs, the Inspection Office Will Act in Place of the Tianjin Customs <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) A Japanese newspaper here published a news item this morning stating that the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee has decided to provide special convenience for North China commerce, which is the same as that in the eastern Hebei autonomous region. All goods unloaded at Chihkou and Chaochiakouzi (both transliterations) south of Dagu can be transported by automobile to Cangzhou and Tianjin and pay half the tax levied in eastern Hebei. For example, sugar is taxed at two yuan per package, and rayon is taxed at ten yuan per package. The loading, unloading, and transportation of goods are protected by the military. The Cangzhou Yanshan Coastal Inspection Office, which opened on March 25, will supervise this method. In other words, regardless of whether the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee receives the Tianjin Customs, the duties of the Tianjin Customs will be replaced by this inspection office. It is heard that a certain Wang and a certain Yuan have been appointed as supervisors. It is also heard that four motorboats, fully loaded with goods such as sugar and rayon, will depart from Dalian today and unload at Chaochiakouzi. (Reuters dispatch from the 19th)</p>

<h3 id="e5">Ministry of Finance Denies the Establishment of an Economic Agreement Between China, Britain, and the United States; Claims That the Government's Subsidy Purchase of Silver Is Absurd <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A responsible person from the Ministry of Finance said that since the implementation of the legal tender policy, the economic foundation has been consolidated and has exceeded expectations. Financial and economic experts from various countries have also praised the achievements of our country's currency system reform. We are now working hard to promote the legal tender policy and will gradually achieve a stable monetary position. There is no need to join the sterling or dollar group, nor is there any plan to join any group. The rumors are mostly unreliable. Chen Guangfu and others are going to the United States to exchange Sino-American economic opinions. The rumor that a Sino-British-American economic agreement will be established is not entirely accurate. However, Britain and the United States have always adopted a friendly attitude towards our country's new legal tender policy and unanimously assisted in any measures that can enhance or stabilize the legal tender policy. This conversation also focuses on the word "assistance." As of now, no documents of any concrete fact have been established. (Special dispatch from the 19th)</p>
<p>(New York) The New York Commercial Daily predicted the results of the talks between US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau and Chinese bankers here, saying that China, Britain, and the United States may establish an agreement to support the Chinese currency system. However, well-informed sources should announce that the United States will continue to purchase silver at prices higher than the world market price when we agree not to sell silver to others in China. Furthermore, it should also be announced whether this agreement has any relationship with British debt. (Reuters dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Since the implementation of the new currency policy, because the people feel that the legal tender is firmly credible, they are happy to exchange and use it. Therefore, the national banks' silver reserves have increased sharply. The rumor that this is due to the government's subsidy purchase is intended to damage the value of our country's legal tender policy in order to influence the Sino-American negotiations on monetary issues in Washington. According to financial circles, in the early days of the government's implementation of the legal tender, many remote areas did not have legal tender circulation. In order to facilitate the people's silver deposits and exchange for legal tender, the government entrusted governments at all levels and state-owned enterprises to handle the exchange procedures on its behalf. The transportation costs required for handling the exchange procedures were still borne by the national treasury. However, when the legal tender extended the exchange period in February of this year, the above-mentioned method was abolished. At the same time, within the above-mentioned time limit, because the difference between domestic and foreign silver prices was large at that time, the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Bank of Agriculture also gave interest to foreign banks in exchange for legal tender with silver coins to show fairness, but only once. From February 4 to May 4, because the Bank of China sent personnel to the countryside to handle the exchange of legal tender, the required transportation costs were also approved by the government to be borne. However, foreign banks in Peiping and Tianjin did not receive interest for exchanging legal tender with silver deposits. All of the above-mentioned transportation costs were factual and necessary expenses for the exchange agencies and were not subsidies for silver holders. How can it be said that they are subsidized silver purchases? This absurd rumor is not worth a smile from those who know. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 19th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance believes that the deadline for replacing legal tender will expire on the 3rd of next month, but the people in the inland provinces still have not been able to exchange as much as possible due to inconvenient transportation and other reasons. It plans to extend the deadline and is considering it. It also plans to add measures to refer the exchange of legal tender to the provinces to instruct the counties to handle it, and in the future, the performance of the handling will be used as the county magistrate's assessment.

<h3 id="e11">The Last Chance for Opium Addicts to Extricate Themselves <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— Du</p>
<p>Since the central government resolved to abolish the Anti-Opium Committee and have Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Military Council concurrently serve as the Director-General of Anti-Opium, using military law to promote the anti-opium policy, its determination to deeply hate and eradicate it has already been seen by all. Chiang is issuing educational orders and enforcing laws step by step. With the trend of the times, the effects are gradually becoming visible. In terms of planting, the inland provinces are of course absolutely prohibited, and remote areas are also subject to scheduled prohibitions. In terms of transportation and sales, the current output is under unified control, and the passing on of secrets is strictly prohibited. For addicts, the goal is to gradually eliminate addiction, with the issuance of licenses for limited consumption until 1940, when planting, transporting, selling, and smoking will all be completely eliminated without pardon. This is a reasonable and well-considered approach, not a hasty undertaking. The repeated orders in official documents and the detailed and comprehensive exhortations show the authorities' dedication to avoid embarrassing people. We in the news industry believe that this is the only good policy and are happy to promote it with words and convey its implications. We dare not tire of repeating it.</p>
<p>Ordinary people do not know the harm of opium, and those who know it still fail to restrain themselves and lightly engage in it do so because the habit has been around for a long time, the temptation is strong, and addiction is easy. This is true for those who are old and sick. Young men and women who linger in pavilions after dancing and singing often quench their thirst with poison and throw themselves into the net when they think of finding excitement. At first, they laugh at the attempt, but in the end, they fall into the black book and find it difficult to return. Is this not even more disastrous? Since ancient times, those who have talked about banning opium have always thought of starting with the source. However, unscrupulous merchants either take advantage of operations as a shortcut to starting a business or rely on selling and smoking as a means of making a living. They do not hesitate to break the law and try to obstruct in every possible way. It is difficult to expect the eradication of the pervasive poisonous atmosphere unless a unanimous determination is made to strike hard. Now, the authorities are banning planting and blocking sources, registering and controlling sales and smoking, confiscating property to scare away their profit-making ideas, and sentencing to death to ensure the ultimate sanction. If all levels of the government are committed to their duties and move quickly, it may not be difficult for the brokers to wash their hands and the wicked to restrain themselves. As for the addicts, under such strict scrutiny, those who are tempted can avoid addiction, and those who are not deeply addicted can be cured immediately. However, for those who are old, sick, and accumulate gradually, it is difficult to get rid of in a hurry. The authorities have implemented a gradual cessation method by issuing licenses, which is a proper way to seek relief for these people. Even during the reporting period, they are still allowed to register retroactively, which can be said to be a careful consideration. If they still hold the intention of waiting and seeing and trying to be lucky, not only will they fail to live up to the country, but will they not love themselves? Time and situation are pressing. The opportunity is fleeting. Quickly rise up and seek the last chance, and there is no room for hesitation.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Yan Xishan, the Pacification Director stationed in Shanxi, recently sent a telegram to Nanjing reporting on the bandit suppression situation in recent days. The original telegram is copied below: (title omitted) Lin Biao's bandit led the First and Fifteenth Army Corps, totaling about 4,000 people. After being ambushed from the north and south by our Tang and Yang Corps in the Xiangling Fencheng area, they fled into the territory of Jishan and Hejin counties. Our army followed closely and pursued fiercely. Because of the Yellow River barrier and the Fen River to the south, the bandits fled to the northern mountains into the territory of Xiangning. Our Tang Corps continued to follow and pursue them. The Guan and Yang Corps went straight from Fenxiang to Pu County and Danning to intercept them. According to Commander Guan, at noon on the 17th, near Pitiaowan in Pu County, they encountered the 1st and 2nd Divisions of the southbound bandit army, as well as more than 1,000 bandits who had fled from the north. Our army launched a head-on attack. After eight hours of fierce fighting, the bandits suffered heavy casualties and collapsed westward. Our army immediately pursued them and is now confronting them in the area of Shangxiawu Village. It is estimated that this battle seized seven light machine guns, 43 rifles, two horses, more than 1,000 bags of flour, captured more than 60 Red bandits, and more than 140 Yugen teams. In addition to ordering the various armies to quickly rush to the ambush in order to eliminate them all, a special telegram is sent to you, Ge Xishan. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 19th)</p>
<p>Yan's Telegram Reports Victory Over Lin to Chiang</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) In the county of Damaqiao and Lingshi Shuangchi Qian and other places, a large number of bandits have gathered again. The bandits, about 2,000 in number, plan to join forces with the remnants of Xu and Liu who fled south from Zhongyang, and the scattered bandits in the county of Zhongyang Shilou. Yan telegraphed to order the various armies to build blockhouses around the bandit areas in order to protect the villages and towns and avoid proliferation. Guan's division defeated Lin Biao's bandit forces in the county and achieved a great victory. Yan sent a special telegram to Chiang and other parties today to report the victory. The original telegram is as follows: Nanjing Chengdu will have the Commander-in-Chief. According to Commander Guan's telegram, the fake 1st Army Corps 1st and 2nd Divisions, which were defeated by our division, were tracked and suppressed. Last night, the confrontation was on the line of Shangxia Wule. That night, we sent Liang Brigade Sangzicun to encircle to the Shangyangde Zhongyangde area. At dawn, the main force of our unit attacked from the front toward Beizhuang. Liang Brigade猛烈 attacked the bandits in Sujiazhuang Fort Village. The bandits initially resisted stubbornly, but our army bravely charged. Until Ji Shi, the bandits suffered heavy casualties and collapsed to the north. In this battle, 4500 bandits were killed, including fake regiment commander Zhang Zhenjie, political commissar Longfa, and many officers below the chief of staff of the fake 1st and 2nd Divisions. The number of wounded was several times greater. 200 bandits were captured, and more than 400 people were coerced and released. 150 rifles, 10 light machine guns, 13 horses, and military flags were seized. The 1st and 2nd Divisions of the bandits suffered more than half their losses, and their 4th and 5th regiments were almost completely destroyed. Our officers and soldiers also suffered 150 casualties. According to the confessions of the captured bandits, the purpose of the bandits' northward flight was to join forces with the bandits in Yang County Zhongyang Damaiqiao and other areas and have other plans. In addition to replying with praise and awarding 5,000 yuan to encourage them, I have telegraphed to report, Ge Xishan. (Special dispatch from the 19th)</p>

<h3 id="e14">Japanese Foreign Minister Arita Decides on Diplomatic Policy, Focusing on China and Russia, Using Economic and Cultural Means <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreign Minister Arita, after clarifying his diplomatic policy at the 68th Diet, convened a meeting of senior Foreign Ministry officials on the 18th at his official residence for careful discussions. It was decided that another meeting would be held on the 21st to finalize the decision. The spirit of his speech follows the Emperor's Rescript, based on a world peace policy. His specific adjustments adopt an independent and proactive approach, focusing on policies toward China and the Soviet Union. Regarding China, it is based on the Three Principles, aiming to adjust national relations. Regarding Soviet relations, it follows the traditional policy, striving to advocate for the withdrawal of Soviet forces from the Far East. China, Japan, and Manchukuo should cooperate based on common principles, absolutely excluding communist ideology from East Asia. The main points of his speech are as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Diplomatic Foundation: Promoting the survival and development of the Japanese nation, while striving to foster peaceful and friendly relations with other powers.</p>
<p>(1) Policy Towards the Soviet Union: Recently, the Soviet government has adopted an active stance towards East Asia, especially "Manchukuo." This requires attention to maintain stability in East Asia. The Japanese government believes that the Red Army does not need to be stationed in the Far East, so it should withdraw. Withdrawing unnecessary Red Army forces would eliminate the root causes of unfortunate incidents on the Soviet-Manchukuo border. The Japanese government can also promptly resolve various pending issues between Japan and the Soviet Union to establish friendly relations between the two countries, which is what we earnestly hope for.</p>
<p>(2) Policy Towards China: The rapid establishment of normal relations between Japan, China, and Manchukuo is what we have always hoped for. However, rampant communism now directly threatens North China and "Manchukuo." The Japanese government cannot but have significant concerns for the stability of East Asia.</p>
<p>(3) Relations with Britain and the United States: Japan and the United States are two major friendly nations separated by the ocean, and there are no problems that cannot be resolved through diplomatic means. Anglo-Japanese relations are extremely complex in terms of trade. Therefore, the British and Japanese governments are frankly exchanging views on adjusting relationships such as insufficient markets and resources. Our reasonable demands will certainly be realized.</p>
<p>(B) Trade Relations: Currently, market closures and collusion of economic alliances in the world hinder Japan's trade development and are extremely harmful. The Japanese government should demand the opening of markets to the world, abolish exclusionary alliances, and strive to implement the principles of free trade.</p>
<p>(C) Cultural Work: To live in harmony with other countries and make the world understand the Japanese national character, cultural work is considered a side aspect of diplomacy, which is necessary. Since Japan is an existing force for stability in East Asia, its cultural essence should be recognized by the world, which is an urgent task. (Kyodo News Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The 69th Diet, convened on May 1st, will hold its opening ceremony on May 4th and its closing ceremony on May 25th. Prime Minister Hirota's policy speech and Foreign Minister Arita's foreign policy speech will be delivered at 10:00 AM in the House of Peers and at 1:00 PM in the House of Representatives.

<p>(Nanjing) The sales of Chinese tea in Java used to be in the leading position. However, in recent years, due to competition from Dutch East Indies local tea and the dumping of Taiwanese tea, the impact has been very significant. According to the latest survey, the current market price of Taiwanese tea in Java is 20 Japanese yen per picul, while the price of Chinese tea is 40 yuan. Although the general literati love Chinese tea, they ultimately have to choose the former due to its high price. The import volume of Chinese tea in the same period last year was 803,000 kg, while Taiwanese tea reached 1,449,011 kg. Therefore, Chinese tea has been overwhelmed. As a result, many overseas Chinese tea shops have closed down, and over ten thousand overseas Chinese who depend on the tea market for a living have become unemployed and returned to their country. If this continues, Chinese tea is likely to disappear from the Dutch East Indies market in one or two years. It is said that our government authorities are now trying to find ways to help.

<h3 id="e34">British Prime Minister Baldwin Proposes Military Sanctions Against Aggressor Nations; Collective Security System Will Never Succeed Unless All Countries Are Willing to Sacrifice <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Baldwin said in a speech in Worcester yesterday that the collective security system will never succeed unless the participating countries are prepared to simultaneously impose military sanctions on aggressors, even if it means war. He also reiterated Britain's position on the Italo-Ethiopian war, emphasizing that Britain urgently needs to expand its military. He also strongly condemned the Italian army's use of poison gas in East Africa.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Italian Army's Use of Poison Gas Greatly Endangers Civilization; Europe Now at a Critical Juncture <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>The Prime Minister said that if Europe sees war again and uses poison gas, the destruction of its civilization is even more certain. He believes that when this new war ends, the people of all countries, driven by public anger and the suffering of war, will rise up to destroy the governments of Europe, and we will encounter a state of chaos and resistance against the evil deeds of those in high positions.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said that when he should retire, he will retire. He also said that he can count on one hand the number of people outside the madhouse who are willing to take his place. The audience cheered loudly. The Prime Minister mentioned the current international situation, saying that the two most important things in the recent weeks are (1) Germany's rearmament and (2) the mockery of the League of Nations, which have proven that the expansion of Britain's military is absolutely necessary. If Britain still wants to fulfill its obligations to the League of Nations and maintain its position in the world, it must take this step. In the recent general election, the government was entrusted by the people to carry out the task of rearmament.</p>
<p>At the end of the European War, it was easy to implement sanctions and make the aggressor immediately succumb to world pressure. But today's League of Nations is no longer comparable to the League of Nations when it was first created. At least three major countries, namely the United States, Germany, and Japan, do not participate in the League of Nations. The non-participation of these three major countries reduces the strength of the implementation of sanctions. The League of Nations could not prevent the Italo-Ethiopian War, but took joint action to declare Italy an aggressor and imposed certain sanctions. However, if one of the two belligerents is determined to wage war without submitting the case's differences for discussion or accepting arbitration, it seems that there is no powerful mechanism to end this war. Furthermore, the implementation of sanctions is slow, and if the final sanction, namely blockade or force, cannot be used as an aid, the sanctions currently implemented have greatly lost their power. But today, it is difficult to say how the blockade can obtain the consent of all the countries that organized the League of Nations.</p>
<p>Italians now have a tendency to attribute praise and blame to individuals for the actions of the League of Nations, but they do not know that the League of Nations' actions are the result of collective efforts. He once read an Italian newspaper that criticized British Foreign Secretary Eden for being engaged in anti-Italian policies, which showed that he did not understand right and wrong and made people sigh. This attack contains two misunderstandings that he would like to dispel: (1) The foreign policy conducted by the Foreign Secretary is not his personal policy, but the policy determined by the entire British government and supported by the majority of the British people. (2) This is not an anti-Italian policy, and its goal is not to make Italy fail or succumb, but to uphold the League of Nations. We want the League of Nations to become the law of the world. This is our goal. Therefore, when the League of Nations is in danger of being destroyed, we are responsible for doing our best to help the League of Nations. This is our only desire for this matter. He believes that the rest of the world will fully understand this. If Italians think that our policy aims to make them fail or succumb, then they are greatly mistaken.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister concluded by mentioning the collective security system, saying that we are currently working hard to operate it and will continue to operate it. We have not yet reached our goal, and we must continue to move forward to achieve it. The collective security system will never succeed unless the participating countries are prepared to simultaneously impose military sanctions on aggressors, even if it means war. This means that the countries participating in the collective security system must be prepared at any time.</p>
<p>The two belligerent countries accuse each other of violating the war regulations. The League of Nations will now conduct a fair investigation. If the claim that poison gas was used is confirmed, and we now have various reasons to believe it is confirmed, then it endangers the world and is no small matter. If a major European country ignores its signature on the public opposition to the use of this poison gas and uses it in Africa, then how can we be sure that it will not be used in Europe in the future? European cities are more densely populated than Abyssinia, and the harm they suffer will be far greater. If Europe sees war again and uses poison gas to fight, the destruction of its civilization is even more certain. He believes that if this is used, then when the war ends, the people of all countries, driven by public anger and the suffering of war, will rise up to destroy the governments of Europe, and we will encounter a state of chaos and resistance against the evil deeds of those in high positions.</p>
<p>European leaders must realize what the League of Nations is lacking in their efforts to maintain peace, how it can be strengthened, how the collective security system can be implemented, and what kind of guarantees can be obtained to prevent poison gas from being used in Europe. But what opportunities do we have now? He does not want to say that the omens are completely unfavorable. There is now dense haze in many places in the sky. However, we have received proposals from the French and German governments and are now paying the most serious attention to them. The same proposal comes from two major European countries at the same time, which is indeed innovative. Who is better than Britain to investigate this issue and seek to bring the two countries closer together? When he was in office, he often talked about the difficulties of dictatorships, because he believed that the dictatorship system would eventually cause more harm than it eliminated. The German dictator Hitler, today, his position holds the power to clear the haze of all of Europe, which is actually greater than anyone in Europe. Mr. Xi's power can actually do this. God allows Mr. Xi to do it. If Mr. Xi is willing to do it, then there will be no trace of what Britain can do left behind. He believes that Mr. Xi has this ambition, and no one in Europe does not want to cooperate with him, because the people of Europe now all yearn for peace and are all terrified of the suffering of war.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister concluded by saying that the next few months are a critical period for life and death. (Reuters, 19th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) Italy submitted its preliminary terms for peace to the Committee of Thirteen on the 16th of this month. The content included a total of four items, which were recently released by the Secretariat of the League of Nations.</p>
<p>Italy agrees to immediately begin ceasefire negotiations, or the military authorities of both sides will negotiate a ceasefire agreement, or the representatives of the two countries will negotiate preliminary peace terms, all of which are possible. However, the negotiation time required for a ceasefire agreement must be very long, just like the negotiation of peace terms. At the same time, special measures must be negotiated to ensure the safety of the Italian army. Italy therefore advocates that it is more appropriate to negotiate preliminary peace terms immediately.</p>
<p>During the negotiations, the Italian delegation believes that the war situation since the outbreak of the war six months ago must be taken into account, and the Committee of Thirteen cannot ignore this level.</p>
<p>The Italian delegation believes that the only appropriate method is for the two parties involved, Italy and Ethiopia, to conduct direct negotiations. The location should be in Ouchy, near Lausanne, Switzerland. Italy also considers all measures to notify the Committee of Thirteen of the progress of the negotiations at any time.</p>
<p>The Italian delegation expressed the hope that the results of these negotiations will enable Italy to actively cooperate with the League of Nations in the general situation. (Havas, 18th)</p>

<p>Vienna The government has recently adopted the labor service and military service system. Today, it held a spring military parade to review the garrison troops in the capital, and the situation was therefore more enthusiastic and grand. The government's intention is to take this opportunity to show the unity of the new Austria and abide by the country's traditional spirit. Before the military parade, a religious ceremony was held in the field. President Miklas, Prime Minister Schuschnigg, and other cabinet members then began the review at "Heroes' Square." Two squadrons of the Air Force circled in the air, with two bombers being the most eye-catching. Finally, the various troops, including tank units and a large number of motorized units, paraded past the reviewing stand. (Havas, 19th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) Vasconcelos, chairman of the League of Nations' eighteen-nation subcommittee (discussing sanctions against Italy), has convened the committee to meet at 11:00 AM on the 21st of this month. The purpose is to consider reports from governments participating in sanctions regarding the implementation of current measures since the committee's meeting on March 2nd, as well as any issues that may arise in future discussions on sanctions. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Thirteen-Nation Committee today passed a report on the failure of mediation in the Italo-Ethiopian dispute, without assigning blame for the failure. Prior to the vote, Committee Chairman Madariaga consulted with representatives from both Italy and Ethiopia on the report's content. The report will be submitted to the League of Nations Council for discussion on Monday afternoon. At the request of British Foreign Secretary Eden, the League of Nations' committee of experts will also meet on Monday morning to study the effectiveness of sanctions against Italy and submit a report to the Council, to be considered together with the Thirteen-Nation Committee's report. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Thirteen-Nation Committee met this afternoon and unanimously passed the report drafted by Chairman Madariaga, which will be submitted to the League of Nations Council for discussion next Monday. The report documents the failure of the committee to mediate the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. All documents related to Madariaga's negotiations with representatives from Italy and Ethiopia have been included, and the report mentions Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's invitation for Madariaga to meet with him in Rome. The report also addresses the issue of the Italian army's use of poisonous gas and the violation of wartime laws by both Italian and Ethiopian forces. Regarding this issue, the chairman of the Thirteen-Nation Committee, Madariaga, condemned Mr. Huber, president of the International Red Cross, because the Thirteen-Nation Committee had previously requested him to provide documents regarding the brutal acts of both Italian and Ethiopian forces, but was refused, preventing the Thirteen-Nation Committee from conducting an investigation. As for the Ethiopian government's citation of the testimony of Polish doctor Boro to prove the brutal acts of the Italian army, the Thirteen-Nation Committee's Polish representative, Komarnicki, provided unfavorable information about Boro's integrity. The committee considered Boro's statements unreliable and therefore did not include them in the report. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Thirteen-Nation Committee today passed the report submitted by the League of Nations experts regarding the use of poisonous gas in East Africa. It contains the Ethiopian accusations against the Italian army and the report submitted to the League of Nations by the United Kingdom. The committee also passed the report by Chairman Madariaga and League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol declaring the failure of mediation in the East African war. Today's meeting was brief and largely a formality, lacking the tension of previous sessions. Madariaga simply announced that the Ethiopian representative was eager for Italy to declare its terms for reconciliation, but after an hour of talks between the two countries' representatives, it was clear that negotiations could not proceed in the spirit of the League of Nations. Italian Chief Delegate Aloisi then responded, saying that Italy deeply hoped to cooperate with other countries in the League of Nations once the war with Ethiopia ended. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Thirteen-Nation Committee of the League of Nations Council requested Italy and Ethiopia on the 10th of this month not to adopt any methods of warfare that violate international agreements. The governments of both countries have submitted replies. Committee Chairman Madariaga has also sent a letter to the Italian government, requesting a detailed explanation of the country's army's use of poisonous gas. It stated, "While your country's reply provided a detailed response regarding the bombing of rescue teams, it made no mention of the use of gas. Although the final paragraph states, 'If the enemy disregards law and morality and resorts to brutal acts, the Italian army will have no choice but to punish them,' this cannot be used as an excuse to use suffocating gas, poisonous gas, and similar gases." In addition, the Italian government, because its Colonel Liberati had previously suffered injuries from Dum Dum bullets, lodged a protest with League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Chairman Madariaga of the Thirteen-Nation Committee of the League of Nations Council, after reviewing the committee's decision, sent a letter to Mr. Huber, president of the International Red Cross, expressing regret for the organization's refusal to provide relevant documents regarding the methods of warfare used by the Italian and Ethiopian forces. He stated that the organization's reason for refusing, namely maintaining neutrality, was understandable. However, he continued, "It is surprising that the Thirteen-Nation Committee, acting in the name of the League of Nations Council, was met with this kind of excuse." (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) French Minister without Portfolio, Peng Gu, held talks today with Italian representative Aloisi, Soviet representative (and Soviet Ambassador to France) Potemkin, Romanian representative Antoniade, and Polish representative Komarnicki. The discussion centered on the situation at the League of Nations Council meeting next Monday. It is expected that the Council will make two decisions on that day. In the morning, the Chairman of the Thirteen-Nation Committee, Madariaga, will present his report, and representatives from Italy and Ethiopia will deliver speeches. In the afternoon, after other countries' representatives express their opinions, a resolution will be passed to conclude the discussion. Alternatively, it is possible that the Chairman of the Council, Australian representative Bruce, will deliver a speech instead of a resolution. (Havas, 18th)</p>

<p>Addis Ababa - It is reported today that Italian forces in the south have now occupied Qiqiqa, northeast of Harar. The Ethiopian government, fearing that the capital may be attacked, is currently seriously considering moving the capital to the west. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(Rome) It is widely rumored here that troops under the command of General Graziani, commander of the Italian forces in southern Ethiopia, recently occupied the city of Qiqiqa after occupying the city of Harar, but this has not yet been confirmed. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to semi-official sources, Italian forces have occupied Harar. Reports from the southern front state that a division of Libyan troops fought for 60 hours and finally defeated the right wing of General Nasibu's forces defending the roads to Harar. It is reported that Ethiopian commander Abibi Dantu and his 3,000 troops were killed in action. The Italian army also suffered many casualties. Harar is the second most important city in Ethiopia.

<p>Addis Ababa - Rumors here suggest that the government has decided to abandon the capital due to the increasing proximity of Italian forces, but officials have stated that this matter will only be decided tonight. A government spokesperson also stated that the police force in the capital is sufficient to protect foreign nationals, so there is no need to worry about their safety. It is rumored that the U.S. Chargé d'Affaires, Van Engert, has instructed American citizens to seek protection from the British legation. This statement has been denied by the Chargé d'Affaires. According to information obtained by this newspaper's reporter, there are a total of 118 American citizens in Ethiopia, 60 residing in the provinces and 58 in the capital, including 9 women and 6 children. In addition, there are also several Belgian officers among the foreign nationals, who are serving as instructors in Ethiopia. They will leave the capital once the Ethiopian government approves, fearing adverse treatment upon the arrival of the Italian forces. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa - Ethiopia is determined to fight to the end in its resistance against Italy. Today, Addis Ababa is still frantically conscripting disorganized troops in the streets, sending them north to try to stop the advance of the Italian forces. Mayor Tigara is also personally giving moving speeches in the streets, calling on the people to enlist. The hopelessness of the war is completely evident. The Belgian technical advisors in the Ethiopian army have already begun their return journey, boarding a train today to Djibouti. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa - The official announcement acknowledges foreign reports that there are internal disagreements within the government and states that the government continues to communicate and exchange opinions with the Ethiopian Emperor. The announcement also confirms reports that the Emperor intends to move the capital to the west, but the name of the city cannot be announced. It is widely believed that this decision demonstrates the Emperor's insistence on resisting to the end, even if the capital is unfortunately lost, this determination will not waver.

The British representative requested that Belgium establish a defense line between Antwerp and Ghent, not in the sense of building fortresses, but as a preliminary arrangement to flood the entire area in case of emergency. Fortresses should be built below Ghent, so that Belgian forces can quickly build a defense line connecting to France's Maginot Line of fortifications. According to French newspapers, the United Kingdom and France are willing to assist Belgium in completing its defense. It is also reported that during the talks, the British air force representative strongly emphasized the necessity for British and French aircraft to use Belgian military airfields in an emergency.

<p>Angora - It is now confirmed that Turkish troops have entered the demilitarized zone of the Straits, which is 47 miles long. The decision was made at the cabinet meeting on Thursday night, when President Kemal declared that in view of the current international crisis, the demilitarized zone of the Straits should have its defenses restored. The cabinet immediately approved the decision, and Turkish troops entered the demilitarized zone on Friday. The second step will be to rebuild the fortifications. (National Telegram, 19th)</p>
<p>Athens - It is widely rumored here that the government received a report today stating that Turkish troops have entered the demilitarized zones of the Dardanelles and Bosphorus Straits. However, according to the semi-official Athens News Agency, as of this afternoon, the report has not been officially confirmed. Regarding this matter, the Greek government believes that since the Turkish government has submitted the issue of amending the Treaty of Lausanne to the relevant countries through legal channels and is prepared to negotiate with them, there is no reason to change its attitude and send troops into the demilitarized zones without the consent of the relevant countries. According to various newspapers, Greece has not yet responded to the Turkish communication. In general, if the signatory countries of the Treaty of Lausanne do hold a meeting to study the Turkish demands, then Greece will certainly participate in the meeting. As for the outcome of the meeting, if the clauses of the Treaty of Lausanne regarding the demilitarized zone system of the Dardanelles and Bosphorus Straits are revoked, then the demilitarized status of the Greek islands of Lemnos and Samothrace should also be abolished with the consent of the signatory countries.

<p>Buenos Aires - The Inter-American Peace Conference is about to be convened. Foreign Minister Lamas has submitted a draft treaty to the conference's preparatory committee to consolidate peace. The main points are as follows: 1. Consolidate and expand the arbitration system; 2. Oppose "armed peace"; 3. Abolish violence; 4. Implement sanctions against aggressor countries, but without endangering the neutrality of the treaty countries; 5. The Kellogg-Briand Pact, the League of Nations Covenant, and this draft treaty should be linked together; 6. Abolish tariff wars; 7. The restrictions imposed by various countries on the shipping industry should be reduced to facilitate the flow of goods. Regarding the consolidation and expansion of the arbitration system, Lamas argues that this system should apply equally to legal and non-legal issues, without distinction. In addition, he also argues that all countries in the Americas, as well as other countries in the world, should be able to join this treaty. (Havas, 18th)</p>

<p>(Washington) Although President Roosevelt has informally stated that he may not ask this Congress for funds to build two battleships, it is known today that Rear Admiral Standley, Chief of the Naval Mission to the London Naval Conference, will soon try to change the President's mind. Standley believes that this Congress should allocate $10 million to lay the keels of two battleships. Vincent, chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, believes that the beginning of naval competition will not be Japan, but the United States. However, there is no fear here that the United Kingdom and the United States will become rivals, because the chief representative of the United States at the naval conference, Davis, and British Foreign Secretary Eden, have already reaffirmed the principle of equality between the two countries at the conference. The United Kingdom has already begun building two battleships, and the United States has three battleships that are four years past their service life. If they need to be replaced, it will take four years to build them. Therefore, the U.S. Navy is eager to begin construction of two battleships this year, so that they can be launched by 1941.

<p>Warsaw - After the clash between unemployed people and police in Lviv on the 14th of this month, the "Colonel's faction" and the civilian cabinet members are increasingly in conflict. There may be a cabinet reshuffle, in which the position of Interior Minister Raczkiewicz is particularly unstable. However, even if a cabinet crisis occurs, it is possible that the Inspector General of the Army Education Department, Zymierski, and the Army Chief of Staff, Sosnkowski, will step forward to mediate, because they did not sign the resolution passed by the Veterans' Association, which called for the formation of a political party to implement the ideals of the late Marshal Piłsudski. The civil faction and the "Colonel's faction" have been at odds since the death of Marshal Piłsudski. The "Colonel's faction" originally advocated abolishing the party system and organizing a parliament of professional groups based on local interests to replace the National Assembly. The moderates, i.e., the civil faction, such as Prime Minister Gościński and Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Kwiatkowski, wanted the cabinet to cooperate with the left wing to deal with the situation. The "Colonel's faction" opposed this policy, and since the Lviv incident, their opposition has become more intense. In addition, the semi-official Polish Daily (the mouthpiece of the "Colonel's faction") has also accused the current cabinet of being weak and incompetent and said that it should retreat from the scene. They have even attacked President Mościcki. Prime Minister Gościński then banned the publication of the newspaper, making the confrontation between the two sides even more obvious. Political figures say that Interior Minister Raczkiewicz should be responsible for the Lviv incident and should resign before Labor Day on May 1st, making a cabinet reshuffle inevitable. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>Warsaw - Prime Minister Gościński, who was originally scheduled to go to the Hungarian capital this morning at 8:00 AM on a return visit, unexpectedly postponed his departure due to "physical discomfort." It is generally believed that this move was caused by the semi-official Polish Daily's fierce criticism of Gościński after the clash between unemployed people and police in Lviv on April 14th, which has even led to the possibility of a cabinet crisis. The Prime Minister therefore postponed his departure. The cause of the April 14th Lviv conflict is as follows: On that day, a group of unemployed people held a demonstration and threw bricks at major buildings. A conflict occurred with the police, who opened fire, killing two workers belonging to the "Labor Front" (one of whom was Korczak) and injuring many others. When the deceased Korczak was buried on April 16th, the demonstrating crowd clashed with the police again. The Polish Daily then began to criticize the cabinet, accusing it of improper measures. The press censor also ordered the newspaper to be suspended this morning. It is reported that the cabinet has had partial changes due to the impact of the Lviv incident, i.e., the struggle between the cabinet and the "Colonel's faction" has begun. (The "Colonel's faction" refers to the old subordinates of the late military minister, the former Polish dictator Marshal Piłsudski, most of whom are colonels, hence the name.) The Polish Daily is one of the main mouthpieces of the "Colonel's faction." (Havas, 19th)</p>

<p>(Special Correspondent for This Newspaper: Cheng Jun)</p>
<p>Yangxin After the Calamity</p>
<p>Yangxin suffered the most during the bandit disasters in Hubei Province in the past, and the destruction of the rural areas was the most severe. I, the reporter, personally visited the area, eager to interview the victims and understand their suffering. However, I was hindered by heavy rain and spent two gloomy days in the city. This morning (the 2nd), after the rain cleared and the sky brightened, I left the West Gate, passed through Songshunao, Guanqiao, Ditianpu, and finally reached Zhanbutou, walking twenty-nine li. Along the way, the number of碉堡 (fortified houses) outnumbered civilian houses, and the severity of the disaster could be imagined. Zhanbutou is a small market town with about sixty or seventy households. It uses tens of thousands of pine trees as fences to defend against bandits. It can be described as the most novel defensive work besides 碉堡. There are few pedestrians on the road, and it is impossible to find food in the town. I offered two 角 (jiao, unit of currency) as payment to buy wheat cakes, but they had no change. Women in tattered clothes digging grass by the roadside were everywhere. When asked, they said they were going to use it to fill their stomachs. This grass is commonly known as red flower grass and is used to feed pigs. Now, they are using it to fill their bellies. It was heartbreaking to hear, but they didn't seem to mind much. According to them, there was a great disaster the year before, and the people had exhausted all means of survival. Although the government provided relief, many still starved to death. In Mushigang and Paishi alone, more than 3,000 people starved to death. More than 1,000 people died of starvation after being taken to the urban area, and more than 1,000 people died of starvation in Sanxikou, mostly the elderly, weak, women, and children. "We are fortunate to be able to dig grass to eat," they said. I also met an old man resting by the side of the road and chatted with him. According to him, there have recently been animal disasters in the mountainous areas. Because there are no people in the areas near the mountains, wild animals have been able to breed. The most common are wild boars and muntjacs, which come out of the mountains in groups of dozens at night to forage for food. As a result, the sweet potatoes and wheat in the nearby farmland are completely unharvested. The government prohibits the use of guns, and hunters have no way to hunt them. By the time I returned to the city, it was already noon. I went to visit the group farm. The farm is fifteen li away from the city, and there are no civilian houses along the way. Occasionally, there are one or two dilapidated walls standing among the desolate smoke and weeds. When I asked a passerby, he said that in the past, the people between the county seat and Mushigang, a distance of thirty li, were prosperous, and the houses were lined up one after another. Now, they have all been burned down. The market town of Mushigang, with more than 200 households, has also been reduced to ashes, with only the ashes of the fire remaining to commemorate it. There were fewer pedestrians on the road than in the western countryside. They were all selling firewood, and most of them were women and children. An old woman of sixty was hunched over carrying firewood, walking and resting. She said that both of her sons had been killed, and her daughter-in-law had been sold. Now, she is all alone and can only eke out a living by selling firewood. When asked about the price of the firewood, it was only one 角. It was so sad! It is said that the red bandits in the county have been wiped out. Single people walking on the road mostly wear "Good Citizen Certificates" on their chests, like government officials in the provincial capital wearing badges. There were no incidents of murder or robbery on the road. However, in the mountainous areas, there are still occasional remnants of bandits. During the bandit suppression period in the past, the upright gentry were either killed by the bandits or fled to other places to avoid disaster, and did not care about county affairs. The inferior gentry seized the opportunity to rise. At their peak, there were so-called "five pests" and "three evils." Now, they have slightly restrained their behavior, but the legacy they have left behind continues to poison society. In the countryside, whenever red bandits surrender, they are seen as an opportunity to get rich. Those with fields have their fields taken away, and those with houses have their houses taken away. Even the main culprits of murder and arson can rehabilitate themselves with money up to a dozen times, while those without money, even if they were coerced into following, are killed. It is difficult to eliminate the bandits, which is understandable. As for the current Lianbao (joint security) chiefs and Bao (village) chiefs, it is said that many of these people are mixed in among them. When the Bao chief travels, he is often escorted by two soldiers carrying guns. The authority of the Lianbao chief is even greater, and he is called the "土皇帝" (local emperor). The household registration fees collected vary from Bao to Bao. Some are divided into A, B, C, and D grades, with Grade A being four 角 per household, Grade B three 角, Grade C two 角, and Grade D one 角. Others are allocated according to household registration, and even the extremely poor cannot avoid paying. I don't know if the government has such regulations. (Dispatch from Yangxin, April 2nd)</p>

<p>Kaifeng Dispatch: Wang Liren, Director of the River Affairs Bureau, accompanied by Zhang Guangcai, Chief of the Engineering Section, went to Zhongmu River to inspect the levees around 10 AM on the 16th, and returned to Bian that night. According to Wang, the peach blossom flood arrived three or four days ago, rising six 寸 (cun, unit of length) higher than usual. The levees built last year were significantly affected. According to the report from the Shangnan Sub-Bureau yesterday, the Dalian Top Rush in the 8th, 9th, and 10th fortresses of Shangfan in Zhongmu were due to continuous northwest winds and the breaking of waves. Wave action eroded the levee foundations and the old shoals. A total of 15 meters of rubble were used to reinforce the levee foundation of six levees in the 8th fortress, 16 meters of stones were used to reinforce the levee foundation of one levee in the 9th fortress, 8 meters of stones were used to reinforce the levee foundation of two levees, 30 meters of stones were used to reinforce the headwater stones of two levees in the 10th fortress, about 20 meters of stones were used to reinforce the headwater stones of three levees, and about 7 or 8 尺 (chi, unit of length) of stones were used to reinforce the headwater stones of four levees, with a height of about 1 公尺 (meter). During the inspection, orders were given to throw stones for reinforcement, with an estimated need of more than 500 and less than 1,000 方 (cubic meters) of stone, which can be completed in ten days. On the 17th, the water level was 2.04 meters at Shangnan, 1.53 meters at Xinan, 1.7 meters at Shangbei, and 1.14 meters at Xibei, completely at the same level. (Dated the 17th)</p>
<h3 id="e66">Anhui Province Implements Tea Export Registration - A Total of Seventeen Registration Offices Established in the Province - <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Anqing Dispatch: During the tea sales season last year, the Department of Finance and Construction of Anhui Province jointly established tea export registration offices in the border areas of Anhui Province. This year, a portion of Qihong tea has been able to obtain tea loans based on the registration volume of last year. The government also supervised production and sales. Recently, with the Qingming Festival over, tea has been put on the market. The establishment of registration offices is imperative. However, due to the changes in the Qihong tea industry and local transportation, the location and organization of the offices should be slightly changed compared to last year. The tea business tax has already been finalized by the Department of Finance, with eleven offices established in: She County, Xiuyi, Qimen, Jingtai, Xuanlang, Tongshi, Taitong, Mabao (attached to Lianghekou Balitan), Maotan Factory, Huoshan (attached to Guanjia Ferry), and Qili River. Registration offices will be established simultaneously to inspect and collect taxes. It is expected that tax revenues will increase as a result. A table was prepared listing the organization and location of the registration offices and the expenses to be incurred, and registration measures were drafted and submitted to the provincial government for approval and implementation. A total of seventeen general and branch registration offices will be established in the province, such as: Wuhu, which governs the Lugang and Jinzhuge branch offices; Xuancheng, which governs the Wanzhi, Guangde, Xinhezhuang, and Langxi branch offices; Jiekou, which governs the Laozhuling branch office; Daohu, which governs the Daqiaotou branch office; Datong; Huaiyuan, which governs the Bengbu and Linhua branch offices; and Sanhe. The above locations will all establish tea trade export registration offices. When tea merchants pay business tax at the tea business tax bureau in the producing area, they should fill out and submit an application form, detailing the operator's name, store name, and other columns. The tax bureaus will immediately verify the merchants' application forms, and if there are no discrepancies, in addition to collecting taxes and issuing receipts as required, they will also fill out a tea merchant's notification and hand it over to the tea merchants for transport. When passing through each registration office, the receipt and notification should be presented to the registration office for verification and registration. Each registration office should compile a summary table at the end of each month and at the end of the term, summarizing the production and sales volumes, and submit it to the authorities for review along with the registration book.

<h3 id="e67">Problems of Learning (Part 2) <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>- Ai Wei, Dean of the School of Education, National Central University</p>
<p>The second relationship is the relationship between learning and emotions. We know that learning requires considerable intelligence, but if a person's emotions are unstable, it will be difficult to succeed in learning, even with intelligence. Examples of so-called emotional instability are given below:</p>
<p>Schools often hold speech and sports meetings, and participants all want to win the first-place prize. In fact, the purpose of schools holding these meetings is to give general students the opportunity to practice speaking, sports, and physical activity. However, for the sake of comparing skills, there are first and second place distinctions. Students should adopt the attitude that "victory and defeat are common in war." However, students are often arrogant when they win and resentful when they lose. Neither of these attitudes is very good. Winners should not be arrogant, and losers should not be resentful. Because failure is the mother of success, after failure, the cause of the failure should be investigated in order to improve. For example, even if one or two subjects fail in the graduation exam, we should often reread them afterward, and never worry all day long, thinking that this will never pass, and fearing that the next exam will also fail. This kind of attitude has a very large impact on academic performance. Students who are often worried are pessimistic about the world, and at the extreme, they become insane due to worry, or even commit suicide.</p>
<p>The second example of emotion is the emotion of love. Students are generally in their youth, and their bodies are well developed, so the emotion of love follows. The so-called "knowing good color means admiring the young and beautiful" is an inevitable fact. "Emotionally stable students interact with classmates of the opposite sex, learning from each other, as if nothing is happening. Even if they meet someone they like and talk about love, they will not forget to study. And because of mutual encouragement, their grades will be even better. However, those with unstable emotions are not like this. They fall in love at the slightest contact with the opposite sex, as if anyone is fit to be a spouse. When the other person responds with a cold shoulder, they hate them to the bone. After several such failures, they inevitably become a woman hater, and whenever they talk to friends about things involving women, they will scold women incessantly. This kind of 'fishing in the air' behavior is seen as ridiculous and pitiful by normal people. These people are truly the most emotionally unstable." Others include those who cannot delay reactionary impulses, that is, they want to get married as soon as they fall in love, regardless of their studies. We can draw the following principle: "Those who plan to continue their studies, if they have the opportunity to interact with the opposite sex, should not indulge in love, so as to avoid trouble. For example, middle school students who want to enter university or university students who want to continue their studies after graduation should prepare fully in middle school or university and should not become entangled in love and tie themselves in knots. This is for those with stable emotions. If emotions are not very stable, it is best to talk about marriage after completing their studies and becoming financially independent. If so, trouble can be avoided in life and academic work can be successful."</p>
<p>The third relationship is the relationship between learning and habits. If our habits are good, then learning progress will be fast. Otherwise, not only will progress be very slow, but it may also hinder learning.</p>
<p>There are many habits related to learning. The important ones are three, which are described below:</p>
<p>The first is the habit of honesty. Everyone knows the importance of this habit in general life. But is it not equally important in learning? The opposite of honesty is opportunism. Some students today lack the habit of honesty and instead use opportunistic methods. For example, they only count the years until graduation, regardless of whether they have gained any knowledge. Or, when taking exams, they are too concerned about gains and losses. When they enter the exam room and feel that the questions are too difficult, they claim to be sick and ask to withdraw, requesting a make-up exam later. Sometimes they avoid the difficult and take the easy. Before selecting a course, they will first inquire about the teacher's teaching methods. If there is a lot of practice required, the grading is very strict, and all the assigned reference books must be read, then they respectfully decline and leave as if they are about to be contaminated. Regarding the cultivation of the habit of honesty, we should nip it in the bud and prevent it from happening. "In the learning process, we should proceed step by step, and we must concentrate on it within a certain period of time. Only after learning is pure and skilled should we participate in the experiment. When taking an exam, answer the questions that can be answered, and leave the ones that cannot be answered blank. Do not answer something that is not asked in order to muddle through. If, unfortunately, we fail, then bury ourselves in reading until we fully understand it. In short, learning is for oneself, not for others. We only seek to understand ourselves, and we do not need to make others fully aware."</p>
<p>"Those who have an honest learning habit know themselves better and can decide in advance whether they are competent for the job, so they will not embark on it rashly, leading to failure afterward. In life, their mentality is more stable, unlike those who are dishonest and disregard their own facts, focusing on deceiving others. The difference between their words and actions is so great that it is like having a dual personality in a morbid state. Therefore, for the sake of physical and mental health, honesty is an indispensable habit in learning."</p>
<p>The second is the habit of order. If we usually adhere to order, it will be of great help in learning. For example, when listening to lectures and taking notes, if the notes are very organized, it can help with memory. Even if the notes taken during the lecture are very scribbled, if they are sorted out afterward, they will definitely be clear when the final exam comes. Many people do things perfunctorily. They seem to be able to recognize the unclear words at the time, but when they take them out to look at them two months later, they are completely unrecognizable.</p>
<p>The habit of order is a scientific habit. When we are doing experiments, if there is no order, the results will definitely be inaccurate. The habit of order is also an economical habit, because if everything is done in an organized manner and objects are taken and placed in an orderly manner, then doing the same thing every day will never lead to disorder. People without the habit of order put A here today and put it there tomorrow, so that they have to look for it every time they want to use it. Therefore, a lot of time is wasted, which is certainly uneconomical.</p>
<p>The third is the habit of perseverance. Perseverance is essential for learning, because academic work cannot be successful in a month or a year. It must be pursued throughout one's life until death. The so-called "it is never too old to learn." If scholars have no perseverance, progress will definitely be difficult. In schools, this habit of perseverance is easy to develop, because teachers guide them on weekdays, and the grades of each student are examined daily. At the same time, the goal is hung in front, and they cannot graduate without continuous effort. During the winter and summer vacations or after graduation, the habit of perseverance is easily destroyed, because there is no one to guide them at that time, and there is no goal, so they become lazy. At this time, we should cheer ourselves up and find ways to arouse our interest in reading. It is best to learn from each other with three or five classmates, because progress will be made with comparison. However, the plans before the vacation should not be too large. Trying to do too much often leads to nothing. We should also pay attention to this point.</p>

<p>Hankou Dispatch: The atmospheric pressure here has been very low for the past two or three days, feeling extremely oppressive and hot, with the thermometer rising to seventy degrees. Unexpectedly, at 1:50 AM on the 18th, there was a sudden combination of thunder, lightning, and a fierce gust of wind, with all the apertures sounding. A torrential rain followed. The wind came from the northwest plateau and moved extremely fast, like ten thousand horses galloping, with roaring sounds. The power plant stopped the current supply due to precautions, and the entire city was dark, so only three people died from electric shock. The telephone was also out of service. After three hours, it finally cleared up, and the wind went straight along the Yangtze River towards the southeast. The business community here received a telegram from Sichuan on the evening of the 17th, saying that the hurricane had passed through eastern Sichuan at about 5:00 PM that day. Eight hours later, the wind reached Hankou. Fortunately, advance warnings had been received, prohibiting inland steamers from sailing. Moreover, the wind came late at night, so the losses on the river surface were small. Only one coal ship capsized in the Yangtze River at the Dadukou pier in Wuchang, and nine of the ten people on board drowned. In the two hours of storms in Wuhan, many houses collapsed and people were killed and injured. After the incident, investigations revealed that in Hankou, 86 brick houses collapsed on Zhongshan Road, Sanhuang Street, Huangpi Street, Minquan Road, Qianhualou, and Zhongzheng Road, killing 18 people and injuring more than 200. The most tragic were the poor people outside the railway who lived in sheds supported by bamboo mats. When the storms suddenly came, more than a thousand of these shacks had their bamboo mats blown away by the wind. Countless poor people were crying and calling for their parents and children in the storms, not knowing where to go. In addition, the sudden drop in temperature and shivering conditions were extremely miserable. In Wuchang, more than ten brick houses collapsed in Datongmen Kuaizi Street, Desheng Bridge, etc., killing 11 people and injuring dozens. The walls of the private residence of the Chairman of the Provincial Government, the Provincial Stadium, the Normal School, etc., were blown down by the wind. Two dormitories at Central China University collapsed, but fortunately no one was injured. Countless shacks along the river were blown away, leaving nothing behind. In total, three thousand households in the three towns of Wuhan had their brick houses and sheds blown down, and hundreds were killed and injured. This unexpected catastrophe is truly unbearable for the hard-pressed people. (Dated April 18th)</p>
<h3 id="e69">Expansion of Guangdong Provincial Textile Factory - The Sole Mission is to Revive the Silk Industry - The Various Departments in the Factory are on a Grand Scale <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Since the implementation of the Three-Year Plan in Guangdong Province, no effort has been spared in the implementation of various industrial constructions. Industry construction is particularly emphasized. Since the three years, various provincial factories, such as textile factories, cement factories, sulfuric acid factories, caustic soda factories, beverage factories, paper mills, charcoal car furnace factories, fertilizer factories, sugarcane factories, and steel factories, have been established or expanded one after another. Guangzhou is becoming increasingly industrialized. Among them, the recent large-scale expansion and successive commencement of work of the provincial textile factory, at a time when the textile industry in our country is declining, is worthy of attention. Here is an exploration of its general situation:</p>
<p>Preparation Process</p>
<p>The Guangdong Provincial authorities, in view of the fact that the silk industry in this province has always been a major industry, but has been severely hit by foreign goods dumping and the impact of the global economic downturn, decided to establish a textile factory to rescue rural areas and revive the silk industry. It was approved by the 105th meeting of the 6th Guangdong Provincial Government in 1933, and immediately began to construct various factories, warehouses, and offices, and purchase various looms, generators, steam boilers, and all necessary machinery and equipment. It was further expanded in March 1934. Now, various departments have successively started construction, and the scale is grand, truly a great factory in South China.</p>
<p>Equipment Content</p>
<p>The factory site is located in Henan. The total area of the factory is 386,400 square feet. The factory is divided into silk weaving, silk reeling, spun silk linen yarn, wool spinning, cotton spinning, and electrical and mechanical departments, totaling six departments, covering an area of 217,884 square feet. The total area of other land is 386,400 square feet. The total capital is 5,147,076.66 yuan. The factory also built its own pond, which can supply the entire factory. The individual situations of each department can be described as follows: Silk Weaving Department: There are 60 looms, working ten hours a day, and each loom can produce 20 yards of silk. Later, due to the large increase in sales and insufficient supply, night shifts were added, and production can be doubled. Currently, the products include Nanxing crepe, Lizhi crepe, Huaguang crepe, silk serge, Yuehua crepe, wool crepe, modern twill, and Mingxing twill. The results are excellent. Silk serge is made entirely of Cantonese silk and is very popular among all sectors. For the purpose of expanding production, it was decided to purchase 100 looms. Silk Reeling Department: There are currently four silk reeling machines, totaling 142 cauldrons. On average, each cauldron produces 10 taels of silk per day. There are currently 200 trainees. During the training period, the daily output of silk is 260 taels. 150,000 catties of silkworm pupae are required each year. The produced raw silk is uniform. Multiple strands are reeled at 90 points, and sitting reeling is at 80 points. All products, with the silk weaving department's needs as the main product, and the remaining materials from silk reeling as by-products, can be used as spun silk raw materials. Spun Silk Linen Yarn Department: There are two refining cauldrons, one hemp steaming cauldron, one dehydrator, one hemp softening machine, four cotton interception machines, two first-pass carding machines, one each of second-pass carding machines, third-pass carding machines, and fourth-pass carding machines, four extension machines, three each of sliver making machines, roving making machines, and roving finishing machines, one combined sliver making and roving finishing machine, one 40-spindle coarse spinning machine, one 32-spindle coarse spinning machine, three 300-spindle fine spinning machines, one doubling machine, two twisting machines, two singeing machines, one yarn shaking machine, one baling machine, one Hans scale, one yarn twist testing machine, and one yarn testing machine, and 38 motors. The machinery in the Wool Spinning Department has been installed and a part has already started construction. The Cotton Spinning Department and the Electrical and Mechanical Department were completed at the end of last year, and have recently been put into operation.</p>
<h3 id="e70">News from the Bandit Suppression in Shanxi Province: The Bandits' Ranks Lack Arms and Ammunition, Putting Them in Dire Straits; The Yang Family Generals Display Extreme Bravery, Repeatedly Recapturing Famous Cities <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Taiyuan Dispatch: The situation regarding bandit suppression in Shanxi Province has now turned from danger to safety. Concerning news snippets from the bandit areas and the rear, there are still some worth recording. I have gathered a few items below:</p>
<p>Playing Theater Everywhere: Whenever the bandits arrive at a place, if the National Army's pursuit is slightly slow, they immediately set up formations and stage their "red" theater to lure the people to watch and listen, taking the opportunity to carry out major propaganda. It is reported that they have done this kind of trick in Shuangchi Town in Lingshi County and Gucheng Town in Fencheng County.</p>
<p>Setting Off Paper Firecrackers: Although the Communist bandits who invaded Shanxi claim to number 30,000, their firearms are incomplete and dilapidated, and their quantity is extremely insufficient. Only about half of the entire group carries arms and ammunition. Recently, after being encircled and suppressed by the National Army on all sides, the bandits have suffered heavy losses. Because the river crossings along the Shanxi-Shaanxi border have all been blockaded by government troops, the bandits' supplies have long been cut off. Recently, due to a lack of ammunition, the bandits have been setting off paper firecrackers during nighttime battles with government troops to cover their movements.</p>
<p>Magistrate Seeking Guarantee: Although the bandits who invaded Shanxi are running around everywhere, encircling various county towns, none have actually been captured except for Xiangling. It was previously rumored that Hongdong City had fallen and the magistrate had died heroically, but this was actually a false rumor. After Xiangling County was captured, there were also many reports that Magistrate Kang Xiaomin had been killed. At that time, the government had even received such reports. Now, the county has been recovered, Kang is fortunately unharmed, and has already returned to his post. According to a letter from the county, Kang's survival was truly a matter of luck. After the bandits entered the city, they had already captured Kang, intending to put him to death immediately. However, because Kang had a good reputation and was highly praised by the people, the bandits asked the people whether Kang was a good official or a bad official. The people replied that he was a good official. The bandits then said that if he was a good official, he could be spared death if he could obtain a guarantee from twenty shops. The merchants were willing to vouch for Kang. After the guarantee forms from twenty shops were filled out, Kang was spared, taking the opportunity to hide in a business. However, the Chief of Public Security, Zhu Shiyu, was killed, which was indeed a matter of fortune and misfortune.</p>
<p>Main Reasons for the Bandits' Defeat: The main reasons for the bandits' defeat in attacking Shanxi are as follows: Yan Xishan has been preparing for communism for a long time. Although the county defense corps and police are not very effective in suppressing bandits, they have achieved considerable success in city defense work. The central government is extremely concerned about the bandit problem in Shanxi Province. Upon hearing the alarm, it mobilized a large army to take on the responsibility of defense, and sent Chen Cheng, the Chief of Staff of the Wuhan Headquarters, to Taiyuan, to reside there for a long period, assisting in the military affairs of suppressing the bandits. With such careful arrangements, victory could be achieved. The bandits lack arms and ammunition, and their strength has been further depleted in battles with the National Army. Judging from the recent situation, the bandits will surely become turtles in a jar. The people of Shanxi are inherently simple and honest, and rich in local ethical concepts. Although the bandits have been luring poor people everywhere to help them, judging from the situation in various counties that have been occupied by the bandits and then recovered, the people in various places have all stayed behind in their villages. Except for a very small number of local ruffians, few have worked for the bandits. Since they have lost the people, this is why they are bound to collapse.</p>
<p>The Yang Family Brothers: Among the senior generals of the Shanxi Army, there are four people with the surname Yang: Yang Aiyuan, Yang Chengyuan, Yang Yaofang, and Yang Xiaoou. Yang Aiyuan was originally a division commander. At the beginning of this war, he was appointed by Yan Xishan as the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression. Later, the central government sent a large army into Shanxi, and Chen Cheng was ordered to come to Taiyuan to assist in the suppression. Yan then reassigned Chen as the Commander-in-Chief of the First Route, and Yang as the Commander-in-Chief of the Second Route. Yang Chengyuan, Yang Xiaoou, and Yang Yaofang were all division commanders, and all participated in the war, personally directing operations. Yang Chengyuan's unit has been stationed in Linfen since 1930, responsible for guarding southern Shanxi, for several years. This time, Yang was ordered to lead his troops to attack the bandits in Xi County, but Linfen County, where his headquarters was located, was surrounded by bandits. Before long, Yang's hometown, Xiangling County, was also occupied by bandits. Yang's subordinates were extremely angry. Therefore, when the order to attack was issued, they cheered wildly. In less than a day and night, they charged and killed, fighting to Linfen, immediately relieving the siege of the county town. After a brief deployment, they rushed straight to Xiangling, and in a few hours, they recaptured Xiangling. They are truly brave. Furthermore, because Yang Aiyuan and Yang Chengyuan have the same surname and the same character "yuan" in their names, outsiders often suspect that they are brothers. In fact, Aiyuan's ancestral home is Wutai, and Chengyuan's ancestral home is Xiangling, one in the south of Shanxi and the other in the north of Shanxi, separated by a thousand miles.</p>
<p>Shooting Bandit Scouts: In their operations, the Communist bandits dispatched a large number of bandit scouts to lurk in various places to spy on the National Army's military situation. According to Yan Xishan's recent statement, as many as 5,000 of these bandit scouts have already entered Shanxi. Their tricks are truly appalling. In order to eliminate these people and reduce the eyes and ears of the bandits, the authorities ordered the relevant military, police, and constitutional organs in the provincial capital and the county troops and county governments to strictly arrest them. If there is solid evidence, they are allowed to execute them first and report later, in order to facilitate military operations. A Bandit Suppression Enforcement Office was specially established in the provincial capital to specifically try these bandit scout criminals. After this order was issued, executions were endless throughout the province. In the past few days, the provincial capital executed two or three bandit scouts at the execution ground outside the South Gate around noon every day, as a warning to those who work for the bandits. There were even two or three cases every day. Until recently, this trend has subsided slightly. It is reported that many have also been executed in other counties. According to reports received by the government, thirty-four people have already been executed in eight counties, including Yangcheng in eastern Shanxi. These counties are still not bandit areas, so what is happening in other counties can be imagined.</p>
<p>Change of County Magistrates: Since the rise of the bandit suppression campaign, many county magistrates have been replaced. Some have been dismissed for dereliction of duty, and some have resigned due to timidity. Among those who resigned, some feigned illness, some begged for mercy, and some used other methods or means. Therefore, the county magistrates who have been replaced in the past two months include those in Qi County, Lingshi, Anyi, Jiaocheng, Xinjiang, Puzhou, Fangshan, and Jiexiu, which is quite a few.

<h3 id="e71">Superintendent of the Ouhai Customs, Xu Hongbin: Second Inspection of the Patrol Team – Delivers Earnest Speech to Team Members – <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Wenzhou Dispatch: Since taking office, Xu Hongbin, Superintendent of the Ouhai Customs, has spared no effort in reorganizing customs affairs. Recently, Xu noted reports that unscrupulous merchants in Fujian Province have established large-scale smuggling organizations. As Ouhai is adjacent to Fujian, Xu is deeply concerned about being affected. In addition to repeatedly writing to the Customs Department to instruct subordinates to pay close attention and take strict precautions, Xu believes that the customs patrol team is the key to suppressing smuggling. He conducted an inspection of the team in January and after several months, he conducted a second inspection at 11 a.m. on the 13th, accompanied by Tax Commissioner Ma and Assistant Qiao, at Jiangxin Islet. The team's various performances were impressive, and Xu delivered an earnest speech, which was photographed and distributed. It is reported that the Inspector General of Customs, impressed by Xu's attention to smuggling suppression, has transferred an Englishman named Mian Yan from the Kowloon Customs in Guangdong to train the Ouhai Customs patrol team. This Englishman has served as a naval officer in his country and has extensive experience in dealing with smuggling. He will train the team in Ouhai for a month. In the future, the results of smuggling suppression will surely improve, demonstrating Xu's and Inspector General Mei's attention to Ouhai Customs affairs. The following is an excerpt from Xu's speech during the inspection of the patrol team: "The patrol team is the key to the customs' smuggling suppression efforts. Everything about it is closely related to the future of customs affairs. The customs jurisdiction is vast, with many ports. I previously went to inspect the coastal areas, and drew up a plan to reorganize smuggling suppression efforts, which was submitted and adopted. The reason for this diligent effort to reorganize is that national taxes are the lifeblood of the country. To increase national taxes, we must strictly seize smuggled goods. The presence of smuggled goods not only harms national revenue but also hinders the business of legitimate merchants, which is extremely detrimental. On the customs side, the patrol team is the one that directly carries out the task of suppressing smuggling. Therefore, your responsibilities are very important. The strictness of your discipline, the cultivation of your character, and the progress of your smuggling suppression methods are all closely related to national tax revenues. Moreover, reports indicate that unscrupulous merchants in Fujian Province have recently organized large-scale smuggling companies, even setting up small radio stations to report the locations of customs patrol boats and various information such as returning to port, adding coal, and adding water. They have also built dozens of sailing ships for smuggling purposes. The situation is very serious. Our region is connected to Fujian Province and is bound to be affected. Therefore, I hope that you will redouble your efforts and patrol diligently, so as to eliminate smuggling and increase national tax revenues. This is what I strongly hope for, and I expect you to have good results."</p>
<h3 id="e72">Fengxian: Investigation of a Smoking Dispute <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>A resident of this county named Jin Fa, over fifty years old, smoked opium due to illness. After the government strictly prohibited opium last year, he obtained a license according to regulations. However, on the night of the 12th of this month, while he was smoking at the Songji smoking den in the town, Yu Yi, a newly arrived service member from the Public Security Bureau, a native of Jintan, came to investigate. Yu slapped him several times, injuring his brain. That night, he developed symptoms of insanity, drooling, with hemiplegia, and complete loss of consciousness. Doctors were helpless. On the 16th, swelling and redness appeared on his left ear and cheek, and thick liquid flowed from the orifice. He is on the verge of death, with no hope of survival. His son, Qi Wu, has already submitted a complaint to the county government, requesting punishment for the perpetrator, but there has been no result.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Suzhou: County Government Sends Commissioners to Strictly Collect Land Rent <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>The Wu County government, due to the fact that the farmers in Wu County have been claiming disaster and crop failure for the 24th year of the Republic, and tenants in Xiangcheng and other villages have even resisted paying rent, resulting in a harvest of less than 50%, has specially formulated a method for collecting rent. The discounted price should not exceed seven yuan and five jiao. Those with severe disasters are allowed to defer 20% of the payment. Zhang Yijun, Pan Renxian, and others have been appointed as rent collection commissioners and will go to collect rent today (20th). All payments must be made before the end of May. Those who are overdue will be detained and forced to pay. The local public security police are also instructed to provide assistance at any time in order to ensure the collection of rent.</p>

<p>The Wu County Chamber of Commerce, Suzhou Electric Factory, Suzhou Orphanage, and ten other groups and organizations initiated a memorial service for Fei Shuwei (Zhongshan) yesterday (19th) at 2 p.m. at the Fei residence in Taohuawu. Zhang Yipeng, Cheng Ganqing, County Magistrate Deng, and representatives from all walks of life attended. Zhang Yipeng and others reported on the significance of the memorial service, and the event ended around 5 p.m.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Wuxi: Strict Prohibition of Copper Coins Entering the City <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>The seventeen trade associations in this county, including wine, soy sauce, and tobacco, previously reported that the exchange rate of copper coins in Wuxi was uneven, with large fluctuations, causing significant losses to merchants and residents. They have already submitted a request to the provincial and county authorities to investigate and ban the practice, and have also requested the Ministry of Finance to instruct the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications to collect and exchange coins in accordance with the law. However, recently, copper coins from other areas have been entering the city, and speculative merchants are profiting from it. Yesterday, they submitted another request to the county government, requesting that a notice be issued to strictly prohibit the entry of such coins. If anyone is found carrying more than the legal amount, the public should be allowed to report them and confiscate the coins as a reward, in order to warn the offenders.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Appeal for Reduction of Rickshaw Tax <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>There are a total of 2,714 rickshaws in this county, of which only 1,759 are in the urban area, while 455 are in the rural area. Traditionally, each rickshaw paid a monthly local public welfare donation, which was originally one yuan, and then an additional sanitation donation of two jiao. Since the unified operation of urban and rural rickshaws in the autumn of the 21st year of the Republic, a public welfare donation of five jiao has been added, reducing five fen in the summer of the 22nd year. In total, each month each is one yuan and six jiao and five fen. Recently, the business tax bureau has repeatedly urged the payment of business tax, resulting in a heavy burden on small rickshaw owners. In Shanghai, Suzhou, Changzhou, and other places, rickshaws only pay a local monthly donation and there is no business tax. Only Zhenjiang, the provincial capital, levies business tax. However, before the business tax was levied, the local monthly donation was one yuan and four jiao. After the business tax was levied, the original monthly donation was reduced to one yuan. There is also a precedent to follow. Yesterday, the rickshaw industry sent a letter to the county chamber of commerce, requesting that it forward a letter to the county government, urging the removal of the original sanitation donation of two jiao, in order to alleviate the heavy burden.</p>

<p>The county chamber of commerce, in order to prosper the market, has negotiated with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to allow steamers to berth at the south bank for a trial period of six months. However, due to unresolved lease negotiations for the opening of the Kailuan Wharf, there have been obstacles. Wu Shouying and others from the Chamber of Commerce have entrusted Ji Xiangji to go to Shanghai to discuss with Liu Hongsheng, manager of Kailuan. They have agreed to lease the wharf location, and a contract will be signed next week. The Jiangnan steamer can then dock on the south bank.</p>

<p>Chenjia Village in Yunting, Second District, put on a Shaoxing opera performance, attracting nearby villagers, men and women, like a sea of people. A person from Jinjia Village shouted insults, and the two sides clashed, using knives and iron rods as weapons, injuring Chen Jinsheng, Tao Zhizhao, Wu Zishan, and Tao Xingbang from Chenjia Village. Chen Jinsheng's life is in danger. The injured were sent to the Fuyin Hospital. The perpetrators, Jin Aqi and others, were detained by the merchant corps and reported to the county for investigation on the 17th.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Yangzhou: Villagers Beat the Bureau Chief <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>At about 10 a.m. on the 18th, Shu Guohua, director of the Jiangdu Construction Bureau, was surrounded by more than 200 villagers, women and children, led by Zhao Yuansan (75 years old), at the earthwork engineering office outside the West Gate. They demanded the land price for the requisitioned land and questioned why the money had not been issued after it had been received. Director Shu announced that the money had not been allocated and that he would be responsible for submitting a request to the county. If they did not believe him, they could go to the county to inquire. However, the crowd was clamorous. At first, they were willing to go to the county together, but then they said it was not necessary and shouted, "Beat him!" (referring to Shu), "Take straw rope and drag him through the streets!" For a moment, the crowd surged like a tide. Shu ordered the gates of the office to be closed, but the villagers broke them open. Shu then fled into the house, but the villagers destroyed the furniture and pulled down the houses. Fortunately, Shu escaped. He was still surrounded, but a few workers rushed to protect him. At the same time, the villagers knocked down the engineer Fan Jiliang, using a straw rope to pull his neck, and dragged him into the mud. At that time, most of the workers returned to the office for lunch and asked what was happening. The villagers attacked them without asking questions, breaking their heads. This aroused public anger, and they fought each other, as if facing an enemy. In the chaos, supervisor Ge Jiasheng and Shu Qifan, son of Director Shu, were injured. Zhao Yuansan's head was also broken. Liu Xianwen, captain of the 22nd Security Brigade, led the security team to suppress the situation, but there was no way to do so. Later, the workers gathered together and escorted Director Shu out of danger from the crowd. However, his jacket was torn and his hat was lost. He hurriedly took a car into the city to report the situation to acting County Magistrate Wang Jizhi and ask for instructions on how to deal with the aftermath. After discussion with the heads of the land and political affairs departments, they decided to report the situation to the Department of Finance and request the allocation of land prices. The northwest gates were temporarily closed to prevent villagers from entering the city. Zhang Shu, director of the Public Security Bureau, also led a special task force of 30 people out of the city to rescue Director Shu and persuaded the villagers to leave. By the time the security and special task forces entered the city, it was already late at night.</p>

<p>The Yin County Literature Association believes that the tombs of local worthies in the urban and rural areas should be preserved to preserve historical sites and inspire admiration. At the 12th meeting on the 17th, it was decided to recommend Feng Tongsheng, Ye Youyi, Cai Ziqing, Zhang Yidong, Yang Juting, Feng Mengzhuan, and Chen Renxuan for review. The standard for protecting the tombs of worthies should be based on those listed in the biographies in the old and new county chronicles. Regarding the tombs of worthies that must be moved, the person in charge of the public cemetery should be notified to designate a duty area for proper burial. After the review is passed, the association will erect a sign and notify the local townships to protect it. A request should be submitted to the county government for approval and implementation.</p>

In an instant, the fire blazed fiercely. The girl and the fish hut were turned to ashes. The girl was charred and her face was burned. She fell into the river and died. The scene was terrible. When Cao returned, he pulled up the dead body, and wept bitterly.</p>

<h3 id="e84">New Norwegian Minister to China, Mr. Kolban, Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning: Awaits Negotiations Before Setting Date to Proceed to the Capital <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>The newly appointed Norwegian Minister to China, concurrently the Minister to Siam and Japan, Mr. Kolban, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 7 a.m. to assume his post, accompanied by his wife. They arrived on the British company ship "Ranchi Putana", which arrived in Wusong the night before and entered the port yesterday morning. At about 7 a.m., it docked at the Jardine, Matheson Wharf on the Bund. Those who went to the ship to welcome him included Tang Shixuan, representing Mayor Wu Tiecheng; Zhang Mengling, representing the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Mr. Or, the Norwegian Chargé d'Affaires and Consul-General in Shanghai; Vice-Consul Kilde; Erwei; and many community leaders. After exchanging greetings with the welcoming party on the ship, Mr. Kolban and his wife disembarked at about 8 a.m. and went to the Astor House Hotel on the Bund to rest. They plan to visit Zhou Jun, the representative of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, this morning to discuss the presentation of his credentials and will also visit Mayor Wu.</p>
<p>Norwegian Minister Kolban and his wife (Photo by International Society)</p>
<p>Remarks: Mr. Kolban met with reporters from various newspapers on the ship and made the following remarks: "I have been transferred from my post as Minister to Portugal to become the Minister to your country, concurrently the Minister to Japan and Siam. I departed from Oslo, Norway on February 6th and spent ten days in Bangkok, Siam. After arriving in China, I originally planned to stay for two months, but due to the long delays en route, I have had to change my plans. I will only stay in China for a short time. After proceeding to the capital to present my credentials, I will return to Shanghai and take a ship to Japan. I will reside in Tokyo and wait until I have presented my credentials in Japan before returning to China. I plan to travel to various places and will travel between China, Japan, and Siam at any time. The date for proceeding to the capital to meet with Chairman Lin and present my credentials, as well as to visit Foreign Minister Zhang and other authorities, will be determined after further negotiations. I have spent a long time on the Pacific coast and have passed through Shanghai by ship, but I have never disembarked and set foot on your country's soil. This is my first time. The relationship between China and Norway is very strong and there are no disputes. I will strive to further improve it."</p>
<p>Mr. Kolban's Brief Biography</p>
<p>When Mr. Kolban arrived in Shanghai, he was wearing a grey tweed suit, yellow leather shoes, and glasses. His hair was already grey and his attitude was very amiable. He is 60 years old and a senior member of the Norwegian diplomatic service. He graduated from the University of Oslo in Norway. He first served as an attaché at the Norwegian Consulate General in Kobe, Japan, and was later promoted to Consul General in various cities, including British Australia. He was later promoted to Minister. In recent years, he has served as Minister to Portugal. After the previous Norwegian Minister to China, Japan, and Siam, Mr. Oberta, was transferred, the Norwegian government, believing that Mr. Kolban had previously resided in the Far East and was familiar with the Far East situation, transferred him to succeed Mr. Oberta. Because Mr. Kolban is a concurrent Minister, the Norwegian Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. Or, will serve as Chargé d'Affaires during his absence. Mr. Or will also be returning to his country soon. The Norwegian government originally intended to assign Ministers to reside permanently in both China and Japan, but was unable to do so due to limited funds.</p>

<p>General Report on Smokers</p>

A Dagong News Agency reporter met with Director Ye of the Fourth Section of the bureau yesterday. According to him, the bureau is ready for the general reporting procedures and was originally scheduled to hold it this morning. However, since Commissioner Ma has not yet arrived in Shanghai, it must be postponed. The supplementary registration of smokers will be carried out simultaneously when the general report begins.</p>
<h3 id="e86">The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association's Stance on Anti-Smoking <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association, with today being the closing day of the Shanghai Anti-Smoking and Anti-Drug Campaign Week, specifically issued a declaration, presenting the association's ten major proposals for anti-smoking. The original text is recorded as follows: 1. Opium is the primary cause of poverty and weakness, and the guiding thread of foreign aggression. For more than a century, it has created the current semi-colonial state. Internally, the people are impoverished and resources are exhausted; externally, strong neighbors are invading, creating a precarious situation that cannot last. It is truly as the ancient sages have shown us, "Things must first decay before insects breed," and "A country must first be attacked by itself before others attack it." All Chinese people should share this feeling and recognition. Throughout history, those who spoke of banning smoking, from Lin Zexu onwards, were in every generation. However, due to the disorganization of groups and the inadequacy of strength, evil often prevailed over good. It is painful to speak of. Since 1924, leaders from various groups and sectors in Shanghai, aware of the rampant disaster and the imminent demise of the country, initiated the National Anti-Drug Movement and organized the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association to take responsibility for its promotion. The call resonated throughout the country, and over 4 million people swore to join the anti-drug movement and requested the League of Nations to limit the world's production of drugs to scientific and medicinal uses. World opinion shifted, recognizing this as a sign that the Chinese people had awakened. Since then, anti-drug comrades in various places have made unremitting efforts to oppose the opium monopoly and protest forced opium cultivation. Many have sacrificed their lives as a result. Unfortunately, during the reign of warlords, the authorities only sought revenue, and the results were not significant. The disaster of smoking remained as before. Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, it has repeatedly responded to public requests and expressed its intention to ban smoking. However, due to internal troubles that have not yet been resolved and the failure of general administration to get on track, it is difficult to achieve practical results. In the past two years, government leaders have sensed the severity of the national crisis and realized that without starting with banning smoking, there will be no way to achieve rejuvenation and save the country from danger. Hence, the approval of the six-year smoking ban plan, extending from ten provinces to the whole country, from narcotic drugs to opium. Now, we feel even more the difficulty of banning smoking and the deep penetration of the disaster of smoking into society. Without the concerted cooperation of the government and the people, it will be difficult to achieve complete results. Therefore, this Anti-Smoking and Anti-Drug Campaign Week is being held, mobilizing all sectors of the party, government, military, and people to make a collective move against the disaster of drugs. It is expected that wherever the army goes, complete success will be achieved, and the century-old disaster of drugs will be completely eliminated, giving this ancient country, which is on the verge of death, a chance to revive. Then, this smoking ban will not be in vain. However, the major policy of banning smoking has countless threads and ends. The central government may not have the determination to completely ban it, and local areas may continue their old ways of outwardly complying but inwardly opposing. If strict enforcement is not carried out, it will be like building a mountain one basket at a time, only to give up halfway. Not only will the deadline for banning smoking be extended, but the spread of the disaster of smoking will become even more uncontrollable. Members of this association have been engaged in anti-drug work for twelve years and have a deep understanding of what they have seen and heard. We humbly present the following proposals, hoping that the leaders of the smoking ban will adopt and implement them, as it will be fortunate not only for the smoking ban, but also for the party and the country. Moreover, Shandong and Zhejiang provinces, as well as Qingdao and Nanjing cities, have implemented a policy of complete prohibition, and their results are better than those of other provinces and regions. It is hoped that this method will be promoted throughout the country to achieve the effect of early elimination. In many provinces, smoking bans are handled by contractors, who have established opium paste shops. Although on the surface, they are only for supplying the needs of registered smokers, in reality, they are expanding sales and using clever strategies. Some contractors openly formulate regulations that only allow opium paste shops to sell more opium paste, not less, as a standard for reward and punishment. The authorities should strictly prohibit this situation to prevent abuses. There are many merchants who sell opium soil on consignment in various places, colluding with local officials and foreign rogues, taking advantage of special forces to smuggle private soil for personal gain and profit from drugs. Before the opium paste shops are eliminated, the government should pay attention to this. In South China and North China, under the protection of [blanks in original], rogue smugglers of drugs are openly unbridled. The government should quickly [blanks in original] effective measures to stop them, so as not to [blanks in original] the opportunity to create sales of drugs by banning smoking. The so-called front door rejects the tiger, and the back door lets in the wolf. The result will be even more uncontrollable. It is hoped that the government will allocate all smoking ban revenue to the expenses of smoking cessation, anti-drug propaganda, and anti-drug education, both to make remedial arrangements and to prevent the disaster of drugs before it happens, so as to achieve the goal of permanent prohibition. It is hoped that the government will [blanks in original] in remote opium-growing provinces, such as Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Chahar, and Suiyuan, regions where opium seedlings have not yet been eradicated, order farmers to switch to growing cotton and grains from this year onwards, and completely ban planting early, so as to cut off the source and eliminate the disaster of drugs. The government has taken resolute action in banning highly toxic drugs, but private manufacturing and selling still exist everywhere. The reason for this is that the raw materials used to manufacture drugs are not managed, and they are readily available in pharmacies everywhere. The government should pay attention to this. We ask the government to cooperate with the League of Nations and the governments of various countries to cancel the opium monopoly imposed on overseas Chinese in various colonies in Southeast Asia within a time limit. We ask the Ministry of Education to order all levels of schools to increase the use of special anti-drug teaching materials. The government should cooperate effectively with the people and social organizations in strictly enforcing the smoking ban, so as to assist where the law cannot reach and achieve the actual effect of prohibition.</p>
<h3 id="e87">The Yellow River: Closed One Month Early, Autumn Harvest Increased by 50 Million Yuan, Public Bonds Pledged at Only 1% Interest <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Kong Xiangrong of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission came to Shanghai to meet with Minister Kong to request instructions on unified river defense measures, and also met with Standing Committee Members Sun and Song of the Economic Commission to present everything. This time, the closing and joining of the embankments was completed one month ahead of schedule, before the Qingming Festival, with the river flow cut off. From an agricultural perspective, this is of great importance. The crops planted in the provinces along the river, such as corn, sorghum, and soybeans, are all sown in April and May, and the Qingming Festival is the beginning of cultivation. After this, a bumper harvest is difficult to expect, or the entire year may be wasted. Taking this Yellow River disaster as an example, the area of the disaster area is estimated to be 10,000 square kilometers, equivalent to about 16 million mu. Excluding mountains, lakes, and houses, with 10 million mu, and each mu yielding a minimum price of five yuan, the autumn harvest of crops can be worth more than 50 million yuan. Moreover, the people can return to their fields and will not become bandits, which is also of great benefit politically. It is also reported that the 3 million yuan in public bonds for the Dongzhuang Yellow River closing project were pledged to seven banks, including the Jinan Central Bank, for 1.5 million yuan in cash, with a monthly interest rate of only 1%, which is offset by the interest on the public bond notes, and there are no prepaid discounts or anything else, which shows the enthusiasm of the banks in providing assistance.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi came to Shanghai on the 18th to handle official business at the Central Bank and to meet with leaders from the banking industry.

<h3 id="e89">Sun Ke Discusses the Draft Constitution, Adding Transitional Clauses, Necessary to Authorize the President to Issue Emergency Decrees, Fiscal Problems in Extraordinary Times are Academic Views <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Various parties have been discussing the addition of transitional clauses to the draft constitution in recent days. The New Voice Agency reporter visited President Sun Ke of the Legislative Yuan at his private residence on Columbia Road yesterday afternoon to inquire about everything. We were granted an audience, and the following is a record of Sun's remarks: According to Sun, the addition of [blanks in original] clauses to the draft constitution was discussed yesterday (the 18th) by the Constitution Draft Review Committee, and will be submitted to the Standing Committee for further discussion in the middle of the week. As for its content, [blanks in original] such as the provisions of the constitution that the county magistrate is elected by the people, but in counties where local autonomy has not been completed, it is difficult to elect the county magistrate by the people. Therefore, a transitional measure must be stipulated: In counties where local autonomy has not been completed, the county magistrate shall be temporarily appointed by the government, and then elected by the people after local autonomy is completed. As [blanks in original] legislative members and supervisory members, it is also stipulated that they are elected by the people. However, according to the current actual situation, there must also be a transitional measure, that is, some are elected by the people, and some are temporarily appointed by the government, and then fully elected by the people when the time is right. [blanks in original] Regarding the issue of the implementation of the constitution, whether it should be implemented immediately after promulgation, or whether a transitional period should be stipulated, and implemented after a considerable period of time after promulgation, etc., all remain to be discussed.</p>
<p>Authorizing the President to Issue Emergency Decrees</p>
<p>Regarding the authority of the President to issue emergency decrees, Sun explained that this is common in Europe and the United States. For example, in France, for the franc problem, the parliament temporarily passed a case authorizing the President to take emergency measures at any time to stabilize finance. Also, the United States' economic recovery policy was authorized by Congress to the President to act expediently. China is facing internal and external troubles. In the event of an emergency, if normal procedures are followed, the National Assembly must be convened, and the matter must be resolved by the Assembly, then the event will have passed. Therefore, there must be a provision authorizing the President to issue emergency decrees, so that in the event of an emergency, the President can take appropriate action, and then follow normal procedures and submit it to the National Assembly for ratification.</p>
<p>Additional Representatives from the Northeast Awaiting Discussion</p>
<p>After the Constitution Draft was revised by the Central Constitution Draft Review Committee on the 18th, it must be passed by the Standing Committee on the 23rd, and then submitted to the Legislative Yuan for revision and collation. The draft will then be completed. On May 5th, the Central Government will formally announce the draft, and then it will be submitted to the National Assembly for approval and promulgation. The election of the President and other issues will have to await discussion and decision by the National Assembly. As for the generation of representatives to the National Assembly, the five provinces and cities in the Northeast requested an increase in the number of representatives they occupy, which is too small. Whether the Central Government will accommodate this request remains to be decided by the Standing Committee.</p>
<p>No Objections from the Southwest to Participate</p>
<p>Recently, consultations with Wang Liangchou, Dai Jitao, Ye Chuzhen, and others also concerned the draft constitution. Wang contributed his opinions as a jurist and did not represent Mr. Hu Hanmin. The comrades in the Southwest have no objections to the addition of transitional clauses to the draft constitution. As for the time of Mr. Hu's arrival in the North, as I have not obtained accurate information, I have not met with Cheng Tianzhou recently, so I am sorry for not being able to tell you everything.</p>
<p>Fiscal Problems in Extraordinary Times</p>
<p>Regarding fiscal problems in extraordinary times, according to Sun, this is the academic view of Ma Yinchu and other scholars, not the proposal of the Finance Committee under the Legislative Yuan. However, in my opinion, in the future, the income tax will be the main source of national fiscal revenue, but it will be difficult to compare with European and American countries in our economically backward country. Therefore, this kind of academic view seems to be difficult to allow in practice.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Measures for Receiving New Banknotes from Various Banks Have Been Determined <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the Preparatory Committee for the Issuance of Banknotes of the Ministry of Finance previously received inquiries from the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications about how to handle the new banknotes that have been printed but not yet issued among the guarantee reserves of the eight issuing banks. The Preparatory Committee immediately forwarded a letter to the Ministry of Finance for inquiry. It is now heard that the handling method has been determined, that is, when receiving the new banknotes that have been printed but not yet issued by the various banks, the various expenses incurred when printing them abroad will be deducted from the cash reserves in full. For example, if a certain bank issues banknotes and must pay 4,000 yuan in cash and 6,000 yuan in bonds for every 10,000 yuan, if the bank has 50,000 new banknotes that have been printed but not yet issued, and the printing cost is 2,000 yuan, then when receiving them, all the new banknotes will be taken and sealed, and the printing cost of 2,000 yuan will be used to offset the cash certificate of 4,000 yuan, and another 2,000 yuan in cash will be paid.</p>

<p>Published Declaration Clarifying Future Endeavors</p>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reports: The City General Labor Union held its fourth delegates' congress yesterday at 2:00 PM in the grand auditorium of the union located in Meijialong, Xiaonanmen, Nanshi. Representatives attending included those from the First District Cotton Spinning Union, Fourth District Cigarette Union, Leather Manufacturing Union, Nanshi Specialty Products Union, Candle Industry Union, First District Paper Making Union, Fifth District Carpentry Union, Dyeing Union, Second District Knitting Union, Fifth District Civilian Ship Union, Porter Union, Fifth District Shipbuilding Union, Military Uniform Union, Sauce Industry Union, Fourth District Rubber Union, Underwear Union, Postal Service Union, Ninth District Soap and Medicine Union, First District Shipbuilding Union, Sixth District Public Bus Union, Elevator Driver Union, Sixth District Water and Electricity Union, Maritime Transportation and Travel Union, Clothing Union, Sixth District Sanitation Union, Postal Workers Union, Pharmaceutical Industry Union, Tugboat Union, Third District Cigarette Union, First District Water and Electricity Union, Fifth District Cigarette Union, Second District Water and Electricity Union, Umbrella Union, Sand Casting Union, Fresh Pork Union, Pharmacy Union, Ginger Slice Union, Automobile Driver Union, Rice Transportation Union, Civilian Ship Timber Union, Winemaking Union, Sixth District Tea Manufacturing Union, Sanitation Water Pipe Union, Third District Cotton Spinning Union, Fourth District Silk Reeling Union, Fourth District Loading and Unloading Union, Seventh District Sanitation Union, Fifth District Cotton Spinning Union, First District Cosmetics Union, Fifth District Paper Making Union, British Public Bus Union, Newspaper Union, Transportation Timber Union, Sixth District Silk Reeling Union, Hotel Industry Union, and more than eighty other labor unions. Over 160 representatives including Zhang Shanqin, Hu Menglin, Gu Fuzhang, Zhang Yiping, Zhang Zhuyun, Hu Zufou, Shen Qingrong, Wu Xiaodi, Wu Ying, Liu Jintai, Shao Bingyan, Lu Yuanxun, Zhu Weichang, Yu Hongzhang, Ren Zhenxiang, and Zhou Weixin were present. The City Party Headquarters sent committee member Lu Jingshi to supervise. The three-person presidium included Zhu Xuefan and Zhou Xuexiang, as recommended by the executive committee, with Li Mengnan added by the congress as chairman. Shao Hubai served as secretary-general, Fang Rusheng as recorder, Li Hua as master of ceremonies, and Zhao Zhenhui, Zhang Yuanming, Zhang Zhuyun, Le Junwen, Shen Fu, and Wan Banghe as receptionists. Security was provided by the Boy Scout troop of the Fourth District Cigarette Workers Union.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Following the customary protocol, Chairman Zhou Xuexiang delivered a report, stating that the term of the third session's executive and supervisory committee members had long expired. According to the union's organizational law, elections should have been held last spring, but due to the nation's troubles and the severity of the situation, the elections were postponed by order of the Party Headquarters until today, when the fourth delegates' congress was convened. The number of representatives attending today exceeds that of previous sessions, and their punctuality fully demonstrates the deep understanding of responsibilities and future directions among our labor circles. In addition to aligning labor circles' steps, strengthening unity, and maximizing the function of collective organizations, we must all recognize the great difficulties facing us and, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, make our utmost efforts for the national salvation movement and the revival of China. With the current bankruptcy of industry and commerce and the increasing unemployment, the suffering endured by our city's workers is rapidly intensifying. To resolve the issue of livelihoods, we must first focus on flourishing industry. Therefore, we must enhance production efficiency and, with a spirit of diligent hard work, pave a path for national industry to thrive. He hoped that all representatives attending today would jointly shoulder this responsibility.</p>
<p>Union Affairs Report</p>
<p>Standing committee member Shao Xubai then represented the third session's executive and supervisory committee in reporting on the general state of affairs, stating that the third session's executive and supervisory committee had originally planned many work projects, with a particular focus on the construction of labor movement undertakings. However, due to limited finances, significant difficulties were encountered in implementation. Furthermore, due to the limited capabilities of the committee members, significant contributions were not made, for which he expressed deep regret to the representatives. He then provided a brief report on the most important work of the third session. In terms of organization, the union has reviewed and issued membership certificates to 98 labor unions throughout the city, totaling over 160,000 members as of recently. While some unions have faced stagnation due to factory closures and member unemployment, the majority of unions have been able to maintain unified intentions and synchronized progress. Regarding labor-capital disputes, the union has made every effort to prevent them before they occur. In 1935, 34 cases were resolved through union mediation (cases not mediated by the union were not included in the statistics). Significant cases included the cancellation of uncompensated leave at the Yixin Toothbrush Factory, the closure of the Minsheng Yarn Factory, the opposition of Zhabei Water and Electricity Company workers to service regulations, the dismissal of workers at the Shenxin Yarn Factory, and the Xiangtai Timber Firm contracting incident. However, the causes of disputes in various industries largely stemmed from employers suspending operations, reducing wages, or dismissing workers, with no disputes arising from worker demands for improved treatment or increased wages. This demonstrates that the city's labor circles have been able to deeply understand the current difficulties and implement labor-capital cooperation. In terms of worker welfare, in addition to striving to oversee the establishment of literacy schools by various unions, six labor supplementary night schools were also established. According to recent statistics, over 1,000 male and female workers are enrolled. Originally, it was intended to add more schools in each district, but this could not be achieved due to financial constraints. (4) Regarding publicity work, the session revived the Shanghai Labor Monthly, changing it to a semi-monthly publication and then to a weekly publication. Special issues were also published on Labor Day last year and on National Day. However, after the fourteenth issue, it was forced to cease publication due to financial difficulties. Other matters, such as participating in emergency relief efforts, jointly addressing the North China autonomy issue with various sectors, requesting central government relief for unemployment, and handling daily union affairs, will not be reported in detail due to time constraints. Liu Xinquan then reported on the detailed conditions of various labor schools, in brief.</p>
<p>Instructions from Higher Authorities</p>
<p>Following the report, Lu Jingshi, representative of the City Party Headquarters, delivered instructions, stating that the large number of attendees today and their vibrant spirit were deeply gratifying. The past work of the General Labor Union, thanks to the efforts of all executive and supervisory committee members, has achieved remarkable success and is highly commendable. Although the organization of the General Labor Union has no legal basis, the various committees have been able to maintain it through hard work, and the Party Headquarters has filed it for record. The central government is also expected to approve the filing soon. He hoped that after obtaining legal status in the future, particular attention should be paid to: (1) Building economic strength. The advancement of any undertaking depends on the soundness of the economic organization. The General Labor Union's weak economic situation has hindered the development of union affairs. It is hoped that all labor unions in the city will take more responsibility. (2) Striving to train workers. The nation is facing severe difficulties, reaching a critical point. The General Labor Union should earnestly focus on promoting training, so that workers have a genuine understanding of the nation and the people, which can unleash great strength. (3) Strictly abiding by discipline. All workers in the city should unanimously obey the labor union, abide by resolutions, and obey the orders of the Party, strictly adhering to Party discipline. Only then can unity be strengthened. He hoped that everyone could work together to achieve these points.</p>
<p>Election of Executive and Supervisory Committee Members</p>
<p>The election of the fourth session's executive and supervisory committee members followed. The list of elected members is as follows: Executive Committee members: Zhu Xuefan, Zhou Xuexiang, Ye Xiangyuan, Shao Xubai, Li Mengnan, Long Peiyun, Shui Xiangyun, Fan Yifeng, Li Hua, Zhang Linhua, Chen Xiupu, Chuan Dewei, Zhao Zhenhui, Zhang Yiping, Zhou Qigui, Zhang Kechang, Ding Changyan, Hu Menglin, Yu Ting; Alternate Executive Committee members: Zhang Yuanming, Zou Dexin, Lu Muqin, Yu Yaoqiu, Le Junwen, Ying Yukang, Chai Zhenyou, Yan Quanrong, Zhang Shanqin. Supervisory Committee members: Shi Yitang, Liu Xinquan, Liu Jintai, Wang Zhuping, Shen Jiabin, Le Lianpin, Xiao Gengsheng; Alternate Supervisory Committee members: Yu Fuqing, Zhang Zhuyun, Lou Jingguan.</p>
<p>Passed Proposals</p>
<p>The following important proposals were then passed: (1) Proposal for raising funds to purchase an airplane for birthday greetings. (2) Proposal for sending a telegram of condolences to Chairman Chiang. (3) Proposal for submitting a request to the central government to amend Articles 20 and 21 of the Labor Union Law. (4) Proposal for submitting a request to the central government to instruct the Judicial Yuan to issue a directive to all levels of courts nationwide, stating that in the event of factory or store bankruptcy, employees' compensation rights should be given priority. (5) Proposal for all workers in the city to consistently practice labor-capital cooperation, strive to intensify production, develop national industry, and build the national economy. (6) Proposal for organizing the second city-wide workers' sports congress and actively promoting worker sports. (7) Proposal for actively promoting labor education to improve workers' knowledge. (8) Proposal for preparing a grand celebration to commemorate the upcoming May 1st Labor Day. (9) Proposal for sending a letter of condolences in the name of the congress to the union chairman, Zhu Xuefan, who has been appointed as the Chinese labor representative to the upcoming International Labor Conference, urging him to strive for breakthroughs and bring honor to our country. (10) Proposal for issuing a congress declaration.</p>
<p>Telegram to Chairman Chiang</p>
<p>The congress sent a telegram of condolences to Chairman Chiang, which read: To Chairman Chiang of the Nanjing Military Commission: Since your leadership of the revolution, you have been diligently striving and loyal to your goals. Your great achievements are worthy of being recorded for eternity. Your prestige is overflowing, surpassing the past and illuminating the present. Now, with the increasing urgency of foreign invasion and the deepening national crisis, you, sir, do not hesitate to endure hardship and preside over the central government. With unwavering spirit, you bury yourself in hard work for the nation. The New Life Movement is advancing, showing the beginnings of China's revival. Economic construction gives the people hope of recovery. Sincerity can move even metal and stone, and the entire nation responds. This congress dares to lead 800,000 workers in Shanghai to offer our sincere support and unanimous endorsement. We respectfully send this telegram of condolences, our hearts full of admiration. Zhu Xuefan, Zhou Xuexiang, Li Mengnan, Chairman Presidium of the Fourth Congress of the Shanghai General Labor Union, Secretary-General Shao Hubai, and all representatives bow in unison.</p>
<p>Congress Declaration</p>
<p>The fourth delegates' congress issued a declaration, which read: This union was established in the autumn of grave national crisis after the September 18th Incident. Entrusted with the heavy responsibilities by the city's labor circles and the earnest expectations of society, we deeply recognize the mistakes of past labor movement policies. The results of class struggle have only dealt a major blow to China's fragile industry and commerce, nipping them in the bud. We also deeply realize that under the constant aggression of the powers, Chinese workers, to seek genuine liberation, must first take the development of national capital and the prosperity of national industry as prerequisites. In the meantime, we must closely organize and concentrate our forces, follow the teachings of the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and under unified and strengthened unity, eliminate the shackles of unequal treaties imposed by various countries and seek the overall revival of the Chinese nation. We, the members of this union, are mindful of the magnitude of the mission we shoulder and strive diligently, not daring to be negligent. However, due to the difficult environment and our own insufficient capabilities, we have achieved few significant results over the past five years. This is something that we, as members, have been deeply ashamed and regretful of. Today, the difficulties are even deeper, and the foreign threats are even more urgent. Coupled with the extreme panic of the global economy and the compounding of natural disasters and human calamities, industry and commerce are on the verge of bankruptcy. When we look back on the past and look forward to the future, we deeply feel that our responsibilities cannot be shirked, and we can only strive diligently under the leadership of the Party and follow Chairman Chiang's instructions to work hard, work quickly, and work practically. Now, at the time of the fourth delegates' congress, we dare to present three things as the goals of our future endeavors: (1) Promote practical labor-capital cooperation and intensify production to develop national industry. Shanghai is the center of the nation's industry and commerce. Since the January 28th Incident, the market has been depressed, and all industries have been struggling, which is an undeniable fact. In addition, with the massive dumping of foreign goods, major industries such as silk, yarn, silk fabrics, cotton, rubber, and tobacco have experienced factory closures and wage reductions one after another. Under these critical circumstances, workers are enduring the pain of their livelihoods being on the verge of collapse, and employers deeply feel the difficulty of maintaining operations. To break through this difficult situation, we must passively avoid pointless labor-capital disputes and actively promote practical cooperation between labor and capital. Under mutual understanding, we will diligently bury ourselves in hard work together, improve technology, intensify production, and reduce the cost of production as much as possible to compete with foreign goods. Only then can national industry rely on growth and development, and the suffering of workers can be truly alleviated. (2) Promote worker sports and strengthen workers' physiques. Gu Yanwu once said, "The rise and fall of a nation is the responsibility of every individual." Today, our country is facing endless internal and external troubles. At this critical moment for the nation's fate, we cannot forget our responsibilities to the nation and the people. To shoulder this significant responsibility, we must first have a healthy physique, and only then can we be able to endure hardship, bear heavy burdens, and go far. Therefore, in the future, this union will actively promote worker sports and physical training, so that the physical and mental well-being of ordinary workers can be fully developed, and they can use the spirit of self-improvement to create vitality for the nation. (3) Promote labor education and improve workers' knowledge. Chinese workers have been despised by the general public due to their low level of education. Furthermore, due to their shallow knowledge and thought, they are easily taken advantage of. To raise the status of workers, we must prioritize improving workers' knowledge. Therefore, in addition to actively promoting labor education to eliminate labor illiteracy, we must also pay attention to the widespread implementation of training, cultivate workers' habits of collective living, and cultivate the foundations of social organization. The above three points are not just limited to these, but encompass a wide range of meanings. We will not make empty declarations, nor dare to boast. We will adhere to these principles and exert our efforts to achieve them. We hope that the Party and government authorities and social leaders will strictly supervise, provide assistance, and that all workers will be united in their efforts to complete this important mission. This declaration is made here.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Seafarers' Party Headquarters and Others Hosted a Banquet Yesterday for Zhao and Zhu, Two Representatives Attending the Geneva International Labor Conference <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Zhao Banfu, design committee member of the Chinese Seafarers' Special Party Headquarters, has been appointed by order of the Central Government as a representative to attend the Geneva International Maritime Conference. He is scheduled to depart on the 24th of this month with Zhu Xuefan, the representative attending the International Labor Conference. The Chinese Seafarers' Party Headquarters and Union, together with representatives from seafarer associations such as the China Merchants Wharfingers' Association, Yan Ying General Office, Commercial Shipping Joint Benefit Association, Ewo Wharfingers' Club, New Taikoo Club, and Zhongcang Association, held a banquet at the Tao Le Chun Restaurant yesterday in honor of the two representatives. The attendees included representatives Zhao and Zhu, as well as Cheng Haifeng, director of the International Labor Bureau. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. Liu's Speech</p>
<p>First, Mr. Liu of the Seafarers' Party Headquarters delivered a speech, stating that today marks the eve of Representatives Zhao and Zhu's departure overseas. He wished to say a few words on behalf of his seafarer comrades. He felt that seafarers were also a type of worker, but workers worked on land, while seafarers worked on water. The prosperity of a nation is often directly proportional to the length of its coastline, and the length of the coastline is closely related to the number of seafarers. Therefore, the advance or decline of seafarers and their numbers have a profound relationship with the nation, the people, national defense, the military, industry, agriculture, and commerce. Our clothing, food, housing, and transportation, except for natural products, are all indebted to the benevolence of workers. However, the low wages, unequal treatment, and difficult and arduous conditions of our country's workers are truly unbearable to witness. We hope that when Representatives Zhao and Zhu attend the international conference this time, they will convey the suffering of all Chinese workers to the international community. There are many issues that need to be raised, but the most crucial are the following two: (1) Improving the status of workers. (2) Relieving the suffering of workers. Only in this way can we live up to our late Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy of actively seeking happiness for workers. He now drank a full cup, wishing them a smooth journey. Wang Jiyi, secretary of the Seafarers' Union, then delivered a speech, stating that the welfare and treatment of seafarers are not only their own problems, but also the demands of the entire nation. Workers of weak and small nations, facing meager wages and unequal treatment, should naturally strive to alleviate their suffering. He hoped that Representatives Zhao and Zhu would take advantage of this international conference to make a comprehensive request and also find time to make connections in order to obtain assistance in economic, spiritual, and material terms and to promote the plight of weak and small nations in order to awaken nations that treat us equally. He drank this cup to celebrate.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu's Reply</p>
<p>Zhu Xuefan replied, stating that he was very grateful for the banquet hosted by the Chinese Seafarers' Party Headquarters, the Seafarers' Union, and various associations. He said that his knowledge and experience were very shallow, and he had no confidence in the outcome of attending the International Labor Conference by order of the Central Government. He sincerely accepted the good advice given by Mr. Liu and Mr. Wang and was willing to work with Representative Zhao to do his best to achieve a satisfactory outcome at the Labor Conference and the Maritime Conference. He knew that the Chinese Seafarers' Party Headquarters and Union had made great achievements in working for workers, especially under the leadership of Special Commissioner Yang, and there had been remarkable progress. He felt very comforted by Special Commissioner Yang and all comrades' efforts to seek welfare for workers. He was attending two conferences this time, the International Labor Conference and the Maritime Conference. There were many issues to be raised and discussed in these two conferences. The International Labor Conference is an organization shared by international laborers, so many international labor issues also need to be resolved at this conference. In general, the situation of Chinese labor issues is different from that of general international labor issues. The international labor issues were simply a matter of labor and capital, while Chinese labor issues involved both labor and capital issues and the issue of imperialist oppression and exploitation. Mr. Liu and Mr. Wang had clearly instructed them to demand the liberation of the Chinese nation, and they would naturally strive to do their best with sincerity. However, Xuefan knew that he had shallow knowledge and limited abilities, and he could not achieve great results by relying on personal strength alone. Therefore, he hoped that all comrades present would provide guidance at all times so that he could achieve considerable success at this conference and make a sincere report after returning home for the comrades' reference. He was honored to participate in this meeting today. In addition to expressing his gratitude, he respectfully toasted everyone.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhao's Reply</p>
<p>Zhao Banfu replied, stating that he was very grateful for the banquet hosted by the Seafarers' Party Headquarters, the Seafarers' Union, and various associations, and that he was unusually grateful for their kind hospitality. Over the years, there have been many conflicts between labor and capital, so the 21st conference was convened to resolve them. Banfu felt very uneasy about Special Commissioner Yang's (Hu) selection of him, feeling that his abilities and knowledge were lacking. Fortunately, Representative Zhu was successful in the Chinese labor community, and he was honored to follow Representative Zhu. The scope of rural bankruptcy has spread all over the world. Since Dr. Sun Yat-sen organized the scattered seafarers, the whole [group] has had a glorious performance in revolutionary history. Zhao had several important motions to propose at the International Maritime Conference, including the working hours of seafarers on ships, the protection of seafarers' diseases, and the payment of wages for seafarers' holidays. In addition, there were two other issues: (1) The inequality of wages between Chinese seafarers and foreign seafarers, and the fact that the treatment of seafarers with the same position on the same ship was always higher for foreign seafarers and lower for Chinese seafarers, which was very unfair in principle and would be raised at the Maritime Conference. (2) The contracting system should be abolished to reduce the exploitation of workers. He hoped that at this meeting, the suffering of Chinese seamen would be expressed and a fair judgment would be obtained. In addition, before and after the meeting, he planned to observe the situation of various seafarers for reference. However, Banfu felt that his talent and knowledge were limited, and he was afraid that he would not be able to bear this heavy responsibility. Fortunately, there was the Seafarers' Party Headquarters and the Seafarers' Union, which had a glorious history, all under the leadership of Special Commissioner Yang, and with the support of Representative Zhu, the result would certainly not be too bad. He borrowed the host's wine to express his gratitude. Then, Chen Haifeng gave a speech, the details of which were omitted.</p>

<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that Shanghai banks and money shops signed contracts with various note-issuing banks to receive marked notes. The method was 60% cash, 40% guarantee, or 100% cash, with the issuing bank rebating 40% interest. Since the implementation of the new currency system policy on November 4 of last year, various issuing banks, such as the China Industrial, China General Chamber of Commerce, and the four banks (Dalu, Yanzhou, Zhongnan, Jincheng), as well as the Kenye, Nongshang, and Siming banks, cancelled the marked note arrangement, leading to disputes. Now, these have been resolved through consultations. As for the China and Communications Banks, they are currently operating as before, but the procedure for cancelling the return of notes will be in effect until the expiration of the contract. The Banknote Association previously received an inquiry from the Tianjin Money Shops Association and has now replied, "Dear Sirs, We have received your letter inquiring about the resolution of our colleagues' receipt of marked notes from the China and Communications Banks. Please investigate and reply. We have investigated that the receipt of marked notes from the China and Communications Banks by our members is currently operating as before. The China and Communications Banks have not made any changes. We hereby reply accordingly, and we hope for your kind understanding."</p>

<p>Reports indicate that dog restaurants and _ restaurants have been established in this city one after another. The affluence of these creatures' lives is beyond the reach of ordinary people. Yesterday, the China Animal Protection Association on Yunnan Road received a report from a charitable organization in Fuding County, Fujian Province, requesting a ban on the cooking and eating of cats and dogs in the county, in order to preserve life. The two situations present a striking contrast, one of affluence, the other of satisfying appetites. After receiving the report, the association's chairman, Ye Gongchuo, sent a letter to the county government to investigate and prohibit the practice. The original letter is as follows:</p>
<p>Dear Sirs, We have received reports that some residents in your county have been capturing, killing, cooking, and eating cats and dogs at will, harming beneficial animals. The situation is extremely dire. Please find a way to stop it. Cats and dogs are beneficial to humans and are not meant for consumption. For the sake of satisfying their appetites, people are wantonly killing creatures. This cruel custom is rampant and has a significant impact on people's hearts. Therefore, we are writing to request that the County Government promptly investigate and prohibit this practice, in order to benefit living beings and rectify people's hearts. We hope that you will investigate and reply to this letter. Respectfully, To the Fuding County Government.</p>
<h3 id="e97">New Novice Monks of Longhua Temple Beg for Alms Yesterday, Collected Enough Grain; Visited Lay Buddhist Forest and Buddhist Association; Bidding for Buddhist Cemetery Held Yesterday <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Since Longhua Temple held the Great Ordination of a Thousand Buddhas, the number of new novice monks in this session has reached over 250. As a result, the number of mouths to feed is large, and there is a shortage of vegetarian food. Yesterday, they specially went to Buddhist Lay Forest, the Chinese Buddhist Association and other groups to beg for alms of vegetarian food. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Novice Monks Beg for Alms</p>
<p>Yesterday at noon, the 250 novice monks of the temple, led by Abbot Xingkong, Supervisor Yongchan, and Deputy Abbot Hongkui, set out on foot from Longhua Temple. At around 2:00 PM, they arrived at the Buddhist Lay Forest on Xinmin Road. They placed the large porcelain bowls they were carrying in the corridor of the forest and began the Buddhist ritual of begging for alms. Li Jingwei, the head of general affairs of the forest, led forest friends Yuan Xilian, Xie Meizhi, and Pan Zongyuan in donating money and goods, which were placed in the bowls. The total amount reached over 200 yuan. At around 3:00 PM, after the ceremony, the novice monks went to the Chinese Buddhist Association on Hede Road and begged for alms in the same way. They returned to the temple as a group in the evening.</p>
<p>Cemetery Bidding</p>
<p>In addition, the Buddhist cemetery initiated by philanthropists Wang Yiting, Qu Wenliu, and Guan Jiong, among others, purchased 100 mu of land on Zhenda Road as a base. Construction work such as digging canals and filling land has been underway in recent days. Since advertisements were placed to solicit bids for the construction of tomb houses, bridges, gatehouses, funeral homes, and other projects, the bidding was held yesterday afternoon at the Buddhist Bookstore on Hede Road. As a result, the Zhang Changji Construction Company won the bid for construction and will start work immediately.</p>

<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports that over a hundred stores, including Changda and Yongxingxiang on Zhaozhou Road in Tangjiawan, jointly petitioned the municipal government yesterday, requesting strict punishment of illegal police officers. The original text reads: (omitted above) It has been investigated that Mei Shunxing sesame oil store at No. 375 Zhaozhou Road brought in five bags of sesame seeds on the morning of April 17 this year. While temporarily placing them in front of the store, while the weighing process was ongoing, police officer No. 3833 suddenly stepped forward to interfere, stopping the weighing process, and instructed the store to immediately move the bags inside. The store owner, Liu Peiyuan, politely requested the police officer to allow him to finish weighing the bags and then he would move them inside, and requested leniency. Unexpectedly, the police officer slapped the store owner and kicked him. The store owner fled into the store, and the police officer chased after him, punching and kicking him indiscriminately. Onlookers gathered, many feeling indignant. The police officer, realizing his wrongdoing, tore his uniform with his hands and detained the store owner, Hu Peiyuan, in the West Gate Branch Bureau. The bureau's officer Huang, without investigating the matter in detail, sentenced him to fifteen days of detention, a fine of five yuan, and compensation for the uniform. We stores witnessed the incident and are extremely frightened. It is a fact that the police officer tore his uniform after committing the violence, as witnessed by us. Moreover, the store owner Wu Peiyuan is an honest and legitimate businessman, how could he dare to beat a police officer and willingly accept legal punishment? It is clear that he has been falsely accused and wronged. Such a grievance remains unaddressed, and police officers act tyrannically and disregard the law. If a thorough investigation is not conducted and strict punishment is not imposed, we merchants will all be in danger. Therefore, we jointly submit this petition, respectfully requesting that the authorities conduct a thorough investigation and promptly release the innocent, and severely punish the illegal police officer, in order to maintain local security and uphold the rule of law, which is in the public interest.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Binshan Native Association Petitions for Extension of Songhu Branch Line to Reach Baoshan City Directly from Paotaiwan, Hoping Construction Will Begin Soon to Achieve Multiple Benefits at Once <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Da Gong News Agency reports that the Baoshan Native Association in Shanghai submitted a petition to the Nanjing Ministry of Railways yesterday, requesting the extension of the Songhu Railway branch line to directly reach Baoshan City in order to facilitate transportation. The petition reads: "Petition to respectfully request permission to extend the Songhu branch line of the Jinghu Railway to reach Doushan County Town, in order to benefit transportation and achieve prosperity. It is noted that</p>
<p>Our County of Baoshan</p>
<p>is located on the coast, guarding the mouth of the river, and is rich in strategic advantages. It is also adjacent to Shanghai, a commercial port, and enjoys the benefits of smooth flow. However, due to its remote location and obstructed transportation, the people's intelligence is closed off, like a remote place. To achieve prosperity, there is no way to realize it. Those with knowledge have long regarded it as a pity. The Association regards Baoshan as its homeland and feels the pain even more deeply. After repeated discussions among the members, it was unanimously agreed that prosperity should be the ultimate goal for Baoshan, and that developing transportation should be the primary task. Moreover, the benefits of Baoshan's revitalization are not only for the people of Baoshan to enjoy exclusively. The scope of dissemination</p>
<p>Can Be Considered Remarkable</p>
<p>The Association takes the liberty of presenting its views and saying a word to Your Ministry. It is noted that the current transportation lifeline of Baoshan relies solely on the Songhu branch line of the Jinghu Railway. The Songhu Line starts from Shanghai and ends at Paotaiwan in Wusong Town. Paotaiwan is still four Chinese miles away from Baoshan County Town. Usually, one must rely on rickshaws or walking to get there. However, travelers going up and down the road of this short distance often feel overwhelmed by fatigue. If bandits are rampant, people are even more hesitant to travel at night. If the Songhu branch line is extended to reach the bridgehead outside the South Gate of Baoshan County Town, then</p>
<p>Smooth and Convenient Transportation</p>
<p>can be expected, and revitalization can be awaited. Paotaiwan to the South Gate of Baoshan is less than two kilometers away. The route is flat, and it is easy to repair the roadbed and lay the tracks. The estimated cost of the line, calculated at ten mu of land in a straight line, is only 2,000 yuan, assuming a price of 200 yuan per mu. In addition, the cost of road construction, based on ordinary standards, is calculated at 10,000 yuan per Chinese mile. Now the road line is only one kilometer and one-third long, and the cost is no more than 33,300 yuan. The cost of building station houses and increasing staff is at most 12,000 yuan. In summary,</p>
<p>Various Expenses</p>
<p>A sum of 50,000 yuan is enough. Although this is not entirely credible and needs to be verified by experts, it seems that there should be no significant difference based on the actual situation. If it can be successfully completed, then Baoshan County Town can directly reach Shanghai, and the speed of transportation with the new Shanghai County will be like what? The low land price in Baoshan will inevitably induce entrepreneurs to eagerly invest heavily in building farms and factories. In the blink of an eye, the Greater Shanghai Plan will be completed, and Baoshan, close to the new port, will further change its old appearance and become more active. Its beauty is like. Furthermore, the scenery within the boundaries of Baoshan City,</p>
<p>The Scenery of the Yangtze River</p>
<p>is also worth mentioning. With convenient transportation, it will definitely attract people from afar to reside there, and there is a trend towards becoming a beautiful residential area. These two points alone are of no small benefit to Baoshan. If we talk about road maintenance, there will be more than enough surplus. Furthermore, Baoshan's southwest borders the Tai and Jia counties, where a motor vehicle avenue has been built. It cannot be smoothly connected to Songhu in the east. Since the Songhu area has always been known as the front line of national defense, if the road line can be extended, it can become a unified line in all directions, which is also beneficial to national defense. Based on this, the construction of this railway is not only beneficial to Baoyi,</p>
<p>Multiple Benefits at Once</p>
<p>is not an exaggeration. The Association is aware of this and does not dare to remain silent. Therefore, it was proposed for discussion at the 7th joint meeting of the Board of Directors and Supervisors, and was unanimously passed. A document was immediately prepared and submitted to Your Ministry, respectfully requesting verification. Furthermore, the Jinghu Railway Bureau has surplus profits every year. This small expenditure should not affect the overall situation. Moreover, this initiative is of great benefit to the local and national governments, and there should be no delay. Therefore, we respectfully request that Your Ministry instruct the Jinghu Railway Bureau to dispatch personnel to survey the route and start construction as soon as possible, in order to achieve success. We await your order with eagerness. Respectfully submitted to the Minister of Railways, Zhang.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Nanyang Hotel: Unemployed Man Commits Suicide by Poisoning, Suicide Note States Husband and Wife Will Commit Suicide Together, but Wife Went Out and Her Whereabouts Are Unknown <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>On the 13th of this month, a husband and wife checked into the Nanyang Hotel at No. 394 North Zhejiang Road, and designated Room 22 as their lodging. They claimed to be Wang Caiying, 46 years old, from Ningbo, and Peng, 39 years old. They rarely went out for several days, and they also bought their lunches and dinners in the hotel. Yesterday at around 10:00 AM, the wife suddenly went out, leaving only Wang in the room for lunch. Until evening, Peng had not returned to the hotel, and Wang Caiying in the room was also completely silent, and did not call the waiter to prepare dinner. Therefore, the waiters were suspicious. Until about 9:00 PM that night, the waiters could not bear it anymore and went to knock on the door. However, there was no response for a long time. They immediately tried to open the door and enter, and found Wang lying stiffly in bed, already unconscious. An empty box of poison was left on the pillow. They knew it was a suicide, and immediately reported to the police station and sent Wang to the hospital. However, Wang died soon after due to severe poisoning. The body has been sent to the morgue for examination. Afterwards, the detectives found a suicide note near his body, stating that he had lost his job and had been under severe economic pressure recently, and had no intention of being greedy for life. Therefore, the husband and wife committed suicide by poisoning together. However, Wang's wife, Peng, has been missing since she left in the morning. If the suicide note is true, then Peng must have been poisoned and her life is in danger. After so much time, she should have been discovered and her whereabouts would be known. But as of the time of this reporter's writing, there is still no news. If Peng has not been poisoned, then her whereabouts are worthy of investigation.</p>

<p>Yesterday at around 4:00 PM, near the Xinjiang Stage in front of Menggu Road, Zhabei, a gangster was defecating by the side of the road. Police Officer Wen Shiying, No. 1853, of the Menggu Road Police Station (29 years old, from Beiping), went to intervene. However, the gangster not only refused to stop but also spoke rudely. At first, they argued with each other. Then, four or five people beat up the police officer, dared to seize his baton and gun, and struck Officer Wen. Fortunately, a neighboring officer heard the alarm and arrived. The gangsters then abandoned the baton and gun by the side of the road and dispersed in a panic. As a result, a suspect named Yu was arrested and taken to the police station. The injured police officer was immediately sent to the Pu Hospital on Xinmin Road. Dr. Mai Shirong examined the officer and found that his face, cheeks, and nose were injured, and his lip was split open. Surgery was used to join the lip.

<p>The Doutian Grand Emperor in the Garbage Pond of Yangjiadu, Pudong, is revered by people from Jiangbei throughout the city. The deity procession and temple fair is held annually in March, surpassing all temples in Shanghai. Yesterday, the heads of various associations welcomed the Doutian Grand Emperor to tour Pudong, with Little Lord, Third Prince, Hard Board Fireball, 19 silken embroidered dragons, several groups of costumed stilt walkers, Land Boat (a boat carried overland), Clam Spirit Ghosts and Monsters, Pavilion Lion Beasts, portraying scenes of Fishermen, Woodcutters, Farmers, and Scholars; Tang Monk Retrieving Scriptures, Grain Officials Eating Shit, Carrying Incense and Hanging Burners, spare no effort on extravagantly impressive and ingenious skills, extending for over ten miles in length. The procession went through a place for four hours. Residents all over Shanghai were out in force. Bo Pu went to watch, so the roads of Pudong towns were crowded. The ferries worked overtime, but the passengers were still crowded. Shops in Pudong suddenly became prosperous, and rickshaw prices tripled, but they were still overwhelmed. Cut purse thieves took the opportunity, and modern girls were crowded in the crowd, being deliberately teased by hoodlums, with conflicts arising from time to time, and all kinds of phenomena unheard of. In total, the group left the temple at 4:00 AM and returned to the temple at 3-4:00 AM, touring Pudong for as long as 24 hours, it can be described as grand.</p>

<p>Chen Woquan, a resident of No. 11, Lane 127, Zhaofeng Road, a native of Panyu, Guangdong, and employed at the China Merchants Bureau's North Wharf, had a daughter named Chen Guoying, 18 years old, who was studying at the Western school run by Portuguese L.S. Hyndman at No. 15, Lane 211, Dong Youheng Road. Unexpectedly, at 5 p.m. the day before yesterday, after school, she hired a rickshaw to return home. When she asked her mother, Chen Li, for 18 copper coins for the fare, her mother refused, leading to a dispute. Consequently, the daughter became extremely resentful and harbored thoughts of ending her life. She secretly went to her bedroom and swallowed poison to commit suicide, lying on the bed awaiting death. Later, her brother, Chen Yuchun, intended to call her for dinner and discovered her condition. He immediately informed their parents, who rushed her to Shanghai Sanitarium and Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and she soon passed away. The hospital reported the case to the Huishan Police Station, which ordered detective Shen Binkui to conduct an investigation. The body was then transported to the Forensic Examination Office on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Local Court was requested to dispatch Prosecutor Song Genshan to the office to examine the body. According to the report of Chinese Head Constable Shen Baoshan, Mr. Song determined that the deceased, Chen Guoying, was a female who died of poisoning. The body was handed over to her mother, Chen Li, who signed a document and took it back for coffin preparation.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Taxpayers' Association Sends Letter to French Municipal Council Requesting Cancellation of Harsh Taxes on Fen Wine Business; Tax Collectors Should Report Facts Accurately; Earnest Protection of Small Businesses is Requested <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Shen Shi News reports that members of the Fen Wine Industry Association in the French Concession have successively claimed to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession that the French Municipal Council has recently been levying counter taxes on members of the industry and extorting a monthly tax of two yuan and eight jiao from small single-room liquor stores, which is an unbearable burden for merchants with limited business scopes. They requested that the association forward a letter to the French Municipal Council to cancel the aforementioned harsh taxes in order to maintain their businesses. After receiving the report, the association immediately sent a letter to the French Municipal Council requesting its cancellation. The reasons stated are as follows:</p>
<p>Counter Tax</p>
<p>The Fen Wine industry has never sold hot liquor, so there is no so-called counter tax. Occasionally, a small number of businesses set up one or two small counters to attract customers in order to maintain their storefronts. However, in reality, having a counter is equivalent to not having one, and it has no impact on business. Now that the French Municipal Council wants to levy a counter tax, it should immediately notify all relevant businesses that, in the future, all small counters that are merely for show should no longer be placed inside the store. If counters are absolutely necessary for maintaining the storefront, they should all pay the counter tax monthly according to the regulations of the Municipal Council. However, the Municipal Council's tax collectors should also verify the facts accurately and not report excessively (for example, Xiechang Tea and Liquor Store at No. 252, Xujiahui Road, has two and a half counters, but the tax collector reported five and a half). This is the first matter that should be earnestly protected.</p>
<p>Monthly Tax</p>
<p>The criteria for the monthly tax on the liquor industry, which is divided into different grades, is not stated anywhere. Under normal circumstances, small single-room liquor stores generally pay one yuan and four jiao per month. However, Zhen Xiangyong at No. 290, Beile Road, Zhen Xingyong at No. 450, Zhang Hongsheng at No. 180, Malang Road, Yu Taixiang at No. 14, Annajin Road, and Qing Xiangyu and other Fen liquor stores at No. 119, Ximen Road, all had their taxes increased from one yuan and four jiao to two yuan and eight jiao last year, and there were even cases of overcharging by several jiao. The French Municipal Council should promptly balance the monthly tax rates of the aforementioned liquor stores and clearly indicate the grading standards in detail to ensure fairness. This is the second matter that should be earnestly protected. The above two matters have been repeatedly reported by the Fen Wine Industry Association. It is requested that your Municipal Council consider the situation and resolve them promptly and provide a reply for notification.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Shanghai Silk Industry Bank Holds Shareholders Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Xin Sheng News reports that Shanghai Silk Industry Bank at No. 460, Hankou Road, has been established for six years. Yesterday afternoon at 2 p.m., the bank held its fifth annual general meeting of shareholders on the fourth floor of the Silk Industry Building. All directors, supervisors, deputy managers, and shareholders including Du Yuesheng, Chen Aishi, Xu Jilong, Pei Yunqing, Wang Boyuan, Wu Kaixian, Shen Qinzhai, Wu Yunxu, Wang Boying, Chen Ziming, Shou Yicheng, Feng Zhongqing, Ma Jiliang, and more than a hundred others attended. Chairman Wang Yansong led the ceremony and read the fifth annual business report, making a brief report, stating that: Fellow shareholders, in addition to what has been outlined in the printed business report regarding the bank's affairs over the past year, there are two points that need to be added to the report. First, banks originally aim to regulate surpluses and deficits, and facilitate circulation. In February of last year, the Silk Industry Association and other organizations in this city, recognizing the decline of commerce and industry and the exhaustion of finance, and the fact that business practices often rely on extending credit, which freezes capital and stagnates trade, jointly advocated for commercial acceptance drafts to alleviate financial difficulties. The goal was to shorten credit periods and increase currency circulation. The bank believes that the promotion of such drafts is closely related to the banking industry, as it can invisibly increase the circulation of currency and benefit all parties. Fearing that the significance of these drafts may not be understood by the general public, hindering their implementation, the bank, based on its desire to serve society, not only publicized their significance in newspapers and published sample commercial acceptance drafts for public research, but also recognized that if the banking industry does not set an example, it would lose the opportunity for conversion. In March, after an important meeting, the bank decided to accept the discounting of these drafts, established discounting procedures, and set up a discounting market. These commercial acceptance drafts meet the needs of commerce and industry. In the future, if all industries jointly promote them, cooperation from the financial industry will be needed to achieve full success. The bank decided to request the Banking Association to discuss and finalize a universal discounting plan when convening meetings, and to consult with the Silk Industry Association and other organizations at any time to promote the benefits. As a result of the bank's continuous advocacy, not only have various industries gradually adopted them, but the Banking Association, in response to the need, has also established a Bills Acceptance Office under the Joint Preparation Committee to promote discounting business. The bank has also joined the office as a member bank. In short, although the bank does not dare to claim to be the first to promote commercial acceptance drafts and bill discounting, it has fulfilled its responsibility to serve. Second, Item 5 of the resolution of the previous annual general meeting stated that, in order to strengthen the bank's strength and consolidate its foundation due to the increasing expansion of its business, it was proposed to increase capital by 800,000 yuan, combining with the original capital to form 2 million yuan. The case was unanimously passed. After the board of directors accepted the resolution, it contacted various parties. As of now, nearly 400,000 yuan has been discussed. Then Supervisor Xu Jilong reported on the accounts, and the supervisors were discussed and elected. Ge Shuqian and Chen Ziming were elected as scrutineers, and Shen Ji'en and Chen Qingzhao were elected as tellers. As a result of the election, Xu Jilong, Chen Aishi, Ge Shuqian, and Cheng Yongliu were elected as supervisors. The majority decided that Lu Zhengbing and Lu Bohong should be the two supervisors. Finally, tea and refreshments were served, and photos were taken before the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>At 10:37 p.m. last night, the 12th branch of Xiang Sheng Automobile Company at No. 277, Fuxu Road, French Concession, was suddenly visited by an uninvited customer, about 20 years old, wearing a blue cloth shirt and trousers and a melon-shaped hat, claiming to need to rent a car to go to the west of Shanghai. The company's accountant ordered driver Wang Xinbao (local) to drive a No. 4963 car, registered as No. 18406 in the concession (No. 4806 in the Chinese area). After the driver obtained the signed slip from the accountant, the uninvited customer immediately sat in the car and ordered it to drive west. After passing Beidichen Road to the gate of the Orphanage Grand Theater, the uninvited customer instructed to stop the car. A well-dressed man, around 30 years old, was waiting there on the sidewalk. Upon seeing the car stop, he also calmly boarded the car and ordered it to drive to Hongqiao. The driver obeyed and drove. When the car arrived near Kaixuan Road, Hongqiao Road, the two men ordered to stop the car. As soon as the driver turned to look back, the two men suddenly revealed their hideous faces, forcing the driver to get out of the car. Driver Wang Xinbao, seeing this situation, realized he had encountered bandits. Seeing the area was unusually desolate, he had no way to resist and sullenly got out of the car. The uninvited customer in short clothes drove away and disappeared in an instant. Helpless, the driver rushed to the nearby Fahua Township Public Security Bureau to report the incident. The branch office notified Xiang Sheng's head office, which reported to the French patrol room, requesting pursuit and apprehension. The French patrol room then notified the public concession's patrol rooms and the municipal public security bureau's branch offices and police stations, requesting them to pay attention to intercepting the car. As of the time of this newspaper's publication, the car was still missing.</p>

<p>The Zi Lin News reports that a squadron of British submarines, making their annual summer cruise to the north, will soon arrive in Shanghai. This is the first time in several years. Another similar number of American submarines will arrive at almost the same time, and cruisers and destroyers from Britain, the United States, and Japan will also converge, making Shanghai resemble a naval base. The British submarine squadron, along with the supply ship HMS Medway, is expected to enter the harbor from Hong Kong on Friday and will remain until May 12, before sailing to Weihaiwei. These warships are not commonly seen in Shanghai, as they have been based between Hong Kong and Weihaiwei for several years and have not passed through Shanghai. The American submarines, on the other hand, have passed through Shanghai twice in one year. The last time they arrived in Shanghai was at the end of October last year, sailing from Qingdao to Manila to participate in the Philippine inauguration ceremony. And during the annual naval exercises, the American submarine squadron will also follow the supply ship USS Canopus. Last Friday, eight American destroyers arrived in Shanghai from Manila. This is the vanguard of the American fleet stationed in Asia. Fourteen more ships are expected to arrive from the south this week, followed by six more. On Thursday, the flagship of the American fleet, USS Waco, will return to Shanghai from Beijing. The American transport ship USS Chaumont will also enter the port. Other warships docked in the Huangpu River include two Japanese training cruisers and the flagship of the Japanese Third Fleet. In addition, there is also a French warship. According to unconfirmed reports, the British cruiser HMS Kent may arrive in Shanghai next Thursday. It is estimated that by the end of next week, there will be about forty warships docked in Shanghai Harbor, a rare sight in this city.</p>
<p>From today (the 18th) to the next four days, the arrival and departure of steamships in Shanghai Harbor will also be at an unprecedented peak, with a total of eleven ships with a total gross tonnage of over 187,000 tons. The largest of these is the Empress of Russia, with a gross tonnage of 26,032 tons, which is expected to arrive from Canada on Tuesday, carrying a large number of spring tourists. Another Japanese steamship is also expected to arrive on the same day. A total of three ships are expected to arrive today, and five are expected to arrive tomorrow. The exact number of passengers and cargo unloaded in Shanghai by each ship is not yet known, but the number is certain to be large, as many of the ships are fully loaded with passengers.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Closing of the Architectural Exhibition - Announcement of Important Declaration Stating Five Points <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Architectural Exhibition, which has been open to the public for eight days at the City Center Museum and the new building of the Chinese Aviation Association, concluded yesterday, which also happened to be a holiday. Throughout the day, over a thousand people visited, making it extremely crowded. Even around 5 PM, hundreds of people were still requesting to enter, with some coming from as far as Suzhou. Therefore, the museum extended its closing time by one hour. In total, the exhibition saw 45,000 visitors over its eight-day run, including students from more than 110 elementary schools. This level of activity in the city center area had not been seen since the National Games.</p>
<p>In other news, at 5 PM yesterday, the association held a meeting for initiators at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA. Attendees included Ye Gongchuo, Huang Boqiao, Zhou Ren, Shen Yi, Li Qianruo, Zhuang Jun, Du Yengeng, Wu Derun, Lu Shusen, Chen Duanzhi, Zhang Xiaoliang, Li Dachao, Hu Zhaochun, Sun Menggang, Wang Xingyuan, and over thirty others. Ye Gongchuo, as the chairman, conducted the meeting with due formality. First, the chairman reported on the exhibition's progress, income, and expenses. Then, the following resolutions were discussed and passed: the association's declaration proposal (passed); the association's draft submission to the Executive Yuan (passed); the proposal to publish a commemorative volume (passed), and Ye Gongchuo, Liang Sicheng, Dong Dayou, Du Yengeng, Xu Weinan, Hu Zhaochun, and Chen Duanzhi were elected as editorial committee members; the proposal on how to make up for the association's significant financial shortfall (passed), and Zhang Xiaoliang, Li Dachao, Lu Fengzhang, Tang Jingxian, and Dong Dayou were tasked with raising the necessary funds; the proposal to ensure the association's permanent existence (passed), and Ye Gongchuo, Shen Yi, Zhu Qiqian, Zhang Xiaoliang, Li Dachao, Guan Songsheng, Zhuang Jun, Du Yengeng, and Dong Daxi were elected to design a plan. The proposal to express gratitude on behalf of the assembly to the association's president Ye and all staff members, and to send letters of appreciation to exhibitors (passed), and the administrative department was tasked with handling it. The original text of the association's declaration is recorded below:</p>
<p>Housing is one of the four major issues of people's livelihood. In recent years, as our country strives for construction, its importance has become increasingly prominent. However, since the introduction of Western architecture, our country's inherent architecture has undergone significant changes. Choosing the best and discarding the worst has yet to yield a final conclusion. As a result, architectural styles often progress along irregular paths, becoming more and more diverse but also increasingly chaotic. It is extremely rare to find originality and unique design expression. As for building materials, they are imported from foreign countries in an endless stream, costing the country at least tens of millions of dollars annually. Its impact on people's livelihood is undoubtedly severe. Feeling deeply about this, we initiated the Chinese Architectural Exhibition, seeking over two thousand items in five major categories: models, drawings, materials, tools, and publications. These were displayed publicly at the Shanghai Museum and the Shanghai Chinese Aviation Association. Additionally, we invited celebrities and experts to deliver speeches at the Shanghai YMCA on important architectural issues, hoping to raise public awareness and discussion. From April 12th to 19th, the exhibition lasted eight days, with thousands of visitors each day, proving that construction issues have indeed drawn deep attention from the public. Based on the purpose of the meeting and the results of recent exchanges of views, this association deeply believes that if the current state of China's architectural community is not urgently changed, time will easily pass, and money, which is hard to come by, will be wasted in vain. Failure to create an authentic architectural style would be the greatest crisis for our national culture. However, it is not too late to address this now, and real reform requires action, not just words. Therefore, we specifically highlight the most fundamental points, which colleagues unanimously believe require societal attention and government advocacy, as stated below. We hope that our fellow countrymen will give it their consideration. Education on architecture should be urgently emphasized in all schools. In modern times, scientific progress and technological advancement rely on specialized education as their foundation. Architecture is no exception. In recent years, due to various new constructions in the country, tens of millions of dollars are spent annually. The number of architects and supervisors needed in construction is estimated to be over several thousand, while the number of such talents trained domestically is no more than a hundred per year. Among the public and private universities nationwide, only a few, such as the Central University in the capital and the Qinqin University in Guangzhou, have established architecture departments. They are pioneering with limited resources, and their facilities are largely incomplete. There are even fewer institutions dedicated to training mid-level specialized personnel. The mismatch between supply and demand is so significant that it is no wonder the performance of architecture is poor, thereby affecting the overall performance of construction. Therefore, we earnestly request the Executive Yuan to instruct the central and local education authorities to promote architectural education, expand training facilities, or establish an architectural academy at the central level dedicated to specialized training, so that a larger number of talents can be cultivated to meet the urgent needs of reality. Domestically produced building materials should be vigorously promoted. It is found that of the newer types of building materials used in public and private constructions nationwide, those taken from foreign countries account for more than seven-tenths. The annual outflow is no less than several tens of millions of dollars. Since the establishment of the National Government in the 17th year of the Republic, this must have amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars by now, a staggering sum. If we do not urgently remedy this, we will continue to talk about construction while becoming increasingly impoverished and weak, which is cause for great concern. According to the industries related to construction, such as steelmaking, ironmaking, copper production, afforestation, timber production, paint production, pigments, glass, ceramics, cement, bricks, tiles, stone, and various decorations, are directly and indirectly related to the livelihood of the people and the balance of power. Observing the general psychology, it is known that the outflow of money is alarming, but domestic products are simply insufficient to meet the demand. Sometimes, even when domestic products are usable, poor management and a lack of marketing skills result in them being unavailable. Engineers and the construction industry, fearing difficulties and seeking convenience, develop habits, further blocking the path of domestic product development. The cycle of cause and effect leads to a downward spiral. In times of crisis, the danger would be even more unspeakable. It is requested that the Executive Yuan promptly circulate instructions to all agencies inside and outside the capital, requiring that domestic materials be used as much as possible in all new constructions, and instruct the Ministry of Finance, Industry, and Railways, as well as the provincial and municipal governments, to make every effort to support the above-mentioned industries in design, operation, freight, and taxation, to enable them to emerge, establish, and develop, and to supervise their production volume and quality, so that they are useful and suitable. In this way, benefits can be kept within the country, and utilization can be more self-reliant. Standards and specifications for building materials should be developed promptly. The most urgent specifications to be established for building materials are nothing more than quality and dimensions. Currently, the standards for the quality of building materials on the domestic market either follow the customs of other countries or are self-defined by the businesses, resulting in extremely chaotic standards and diverse names. Dimensional standards are even more lacking in uniformity. Although major cities such as Nanjing, Shanghai, and Beiping have some regulations, they are each governed independently and are not unified. The quality standards, names, and dimensions of building materials are practically non-existent. As a result, the progress of construction projects is often hampered, and the safety of people's lives and property lacks protection. If the government formulates quality standards, verifies names, and unifies dimensions and grades for various building materials such as cement, timber, steel, bricks, tiles, hardware, glass, paint, etc., then the system in all regions will be unified, and inferior goods will find it difficult to be substituted and deceive. Product manufacturers, planners, and owners will all benefit. Furthermore, industrial hazards will be reduced daily due to strict restrictions on quality standards such as load-bearing capacity and tensile strength. It can be asserted. It is requested that the Executive Yuan immediately instruct the Ministries of Interior and Industry to formulate these standards as soon as possible to demonstrate renewal and facilitate application. Ancient and famous buildings within the country should be seriously protected by the government through instructions to provincial and municipal governments. China's architecture has historically possessed unique characteristics in the world. Although times and customs have changed, there are still many aspects that can be modeled after. Examples such as the grottoes of Dunhuang and Yungang, the sculptures of Longmen, and the Sarira Pagoda of Qixia all express the spirit of the nation and embody the crystallization of culture, and are important materials for exploring our national art. In recent years, China has focused on modern construction, paying little attention to famous ancient buildings. Furthermore, the common people lack awareness of their preservation, resulting in much damage. Looking at the West, the ancient Roman arena and the Greek temples, although in ruins, embody the great spirit of their nations. Therefore, the preservation of architectural relics is not only an aid to museums but also serves to promote the virtues of the nation. Furthermore, the current question in Chinese architecture is how to create a new style that does not merely imitate Europe and the West, nor is it limited by tradition, but seeks to adapt to national customs, real life, and economic conditions. Therefore, the advantages of China's inherent architecture urgently need to be studied and referenced. It is requested that the Executive Yuan instruct the Ministries of Interior and Education, the Central Antiquities Preservation Committee, and the provincial and municipal governments to seriously protect famous buildings and their relics from all dynasties, urging officials and civilians to take effective measures and not treat this as a mere formality, so that the future of culture and economy will benefit. All agencies related to architectural duties should uniformly employ architectural experts and provide more job opportunities for architects. Architects are similar to ordinary engineers but are actually different. The key elements of architecture are safety, practicality, and aesthetics. Engineers are only responsible for the structural safety of buildings, while architects are not. Architects must also seek to combine practicality, sturdiness, and beauty. Structural safety is certainly a key point, but as times progress and matters become more complex, it is undoubtedly necessary for buildings to be suitable for their specialized purposes. Considering location and economy, and planning for savings, architecture inherently belongs to art, and its patterns and methods are the means to showcase national culture. Therefore, the services of architects not only meet the needs of enterprises but also allow public works administration to rely on architects to apply their knowledge and experience to guide everything, in order to increase the welfare of the people. Today, public and private buildings are changing rapidly everywhere, but upon further examination, some government offices resemble residences, and some libraries resemble ordinary offices. The three major elements of suitability, sturdiness, and beauty are rarely balanced. Alternatively, there is blind faith in foreign architects, and designs and supervision are sought only from foreigners, without considering whether they are suitable for China's needs or economical. The resulting increase in the use of foreign materials and the suppression of specialized talent are inevitable. Furthermore, the heads of architectural departments in various agencies, due to a lack of talent, often rely on amateurs or those with superficial knowledge to manage public works administration, resulting in inappropriate measures and a lack of supervision and guidance. Therefore, although a huge amount of money is spent on construction each year, specialized domestic talent is not given sufficient opportunity to display their skills, and there is no way to promote the progress and improvement of the architectural industry. It is proposed that the Executive Yuan issue a circular to the entire country, stating that in the future, all positions related to the management of architecture should uniformly employ specialized architectural talent and that non-specialists should no longer be used to fill these positions. Government buildings should provide domestic architects with job opportunities and not readily employ foreign architects, so that they can improve and become versatile talents. This is of no small importance to the development of all new undertakings.</p>
<p>The above five points, approved by the association's general assembly, are considered essential plans that should be promptly submitted to the government for implementation. It is hoped that all colleagues and comrades in the country will unanimously support them to achieve early realization. Social facilities that should be available (such as factories, etc.) are also expected to be actively prepared in advance to complement government facilities in fulfilling the mission of the architectural community. This is hereby declared.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Anti-Smoking Movement <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Kaixian</p>
<p>Also to the compatriots of all circles in Shanghai</p>
<p>The anti-smoking movement did not start today. In the first year of Daoguang in the Qing Dynasty, Ruan Yuan, Governor-General of Liangguang, requested a ban on smoking. In the nineteenth year, Lin Zexu investigated affairs at the Haikou port in Guangdong and began to put theory into practice, strictly prohibiting opium and burning all the opium stored by British merchants. However, imperialists willingly started wars to sell opium, and as a result, we failed in the war and the opium ban was relaxed. After the Xinhai Revolution, President Sun Yat-sen took office as president and started anew with the people, repeatedly reiterating the ban and striving to eliminate opium. Unfortunately, after President Sun retired, political power fell into the hands of the Beiyang warlords. Some borrowed the name of banning smoking to collect money, while others forced people to grow opium to support their troops. As a result, the bans were abolished, and opium flooded the country, causing widespread harm that worsened over time. Recalling the anti-smoking movement of the past century, we deeply lament its inconsistency, its stop-and-go nature, and we cannot help but feel heartbroken and filled with hidden anxieties!</p>
<p>After the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, it made banning smoking and rejecting drugs a matter of urgency. Last year, the Central Political Conference, in order to promote the efficiency of the anti-smoking effort, strengthened the anti-smoking agencies, specially appointed Chairman Chiang as the Anti-Smoking Supervisor, promulgated regulations for punishing offenders, and set a deadline for eliminating opium in order to completely eliminate opium within the statutory years. Over the past year, the results have been remarkable, and international opinion has changed. The great task of banning smoking that has not been accomplished for a century will certainly be completed as scheduled under the leadership of the National Government and Supervisor Chiang, which can be predicted. However, there is one thing that we must pay close attention to: within our country's territory, there are still special areas such as foreign concessions in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Hankou. These special areas, restricted by treaties, are beyond the reach of government power, and have historically been distribution centers for selling opium. All those who willingly drink poison and wallow in forgetfulness also gather here. If we want to completely complete the task of banning smoking, we cannot rely solely on political power in these special areas, but must rely on the efforts of social forces. Chairman Chiang has also seen this, and once earnestly told us: "The situation in China is relatively special. If the work of banning smoking relies solely on the efforts of the government, it is indeed not easy to achieve completely, because there are many places (such as the concessions in Shanghai, Hankou, and Tianjin) and many malpractices (such as foreigners selling drugs within China) that the government's power cannot fully reach. Therefore, in many cases, it is more effective to rely on social forces than to rely solely on the government's power to ban smoking." He also said: "Regarding the international aspect, namely the concessions in Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, and other places, where foreigners directly or indirectly manufacture and sell drugs, which is beyond the reach of our government's power, we can only try our best to arouse the sympathy of international public opinion and use social and moral forces to prevent and control it, so that foreigners who sell drugs for profit will also dare not openly engage in criminal behavior." Therefore, those of us who live in Shanghai must deeply understand the government's bitter determination to ban smoking, assist the government, jointly reject drugs, demonstrate the organizational power of society, and create a strong public opinion to eradicate drugs, so that all Chinese and foreigners who sell drugs for profit and willingly drink poison can no longer use the concession areas as their lairs and no longer use international power as their protection. And so that the anti-smoking movement in the concession areas can be in sync with our government's anti-smoking movement. In this way, the great task of completely eliminating opium can be accomplished.</p>
<p>President Sun once said: "The scourge of opium has afflicted China for a hundred years." Addiction pervades both the noble and the base, spreading throughout the country, causing loss of employment and time, wasting wealth and ruining bodies. If this continues, the race will be lost. The harm caused by this is no less than that of foreign enemies." Those returning from the four northeastern provinces also constantly say that "the enemy is turning our northeastern compatriots black, hoping to destroy their race." Alas! If we do not make efforts to ban smoking today, not only will we, as Lin Zexu said, have no money to raise and no soldiers to train, but racial destruction is already imminent. This is what the enemy is praying for. Can we turn a blind eye and stand idly by? There are many ways to save the country, and banning smoking is an essential one. Compatriots of all circles in Shanghai, you also know what to strive for!</p>
<h3 id="e123">Smoking Ban and National Revival <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Jingtu</p>
<p>The prosperity or decline of a nation is based on the soundness of each individual that constitutes it. China's national strength has declined drastically over the past century, and it can be said that the main reason for this decline is the harm caused by opium. The Anglo-Chinese War, caused by the opium issue, created the deeply rooted power of imperialism in our country, opened the door to aggression by the great powers, and was the biggest fatal injury to our nation's survival. Domestically, opium seedlings are everywhere, and the farmland in the border provinces is almost entirely planted with poisonous substances, which makes food scarce and forces us to rely on foreign rice. The money lost each year is countless. At the same time, the people are deeply addicted to opium, which not only wastes money and interferes with work, causing individuals to fall into bankruptcy, but also weakens their physical constitution, thus causing the national spirit to decline to an irreversible level. If we allow it to continue, in a hundred years the whole country will probably become a nation of opium addicts and sick people, and we will destroy ourselves without waiting for others to invade. The intensity of this invisible opium disaster is actually much greater than any political, military, or economic aggression.</p>
<p>Therefore, China's current problem is not just how to resist foreign aggression, but also how to completely ban smoking. The history of banning smoking in China is already long. At the end of the Ming Dynasty, the government began to ban smoking, but unfortunately the methods used in the past were not appropriate. Either they were too hasty or they became indulgent. As a result, they were not effective. In addition, since the founding of the Republic of China, there have been years of civil war and warlord separatism, which led to the abandonment of the anti-smoking policy and instead allowed opium to spread throughout the country, becoming more and more intense. This is truly a heartbreaking thing from the standpoint of the nation.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the National Government, the central government has recognized that the nation will not be able to rise until the opium is completely eliminated. Therefore, it has listed banning smoking as an important policy. Recently, it has formulated a six-year plan to ban smoking. The inland provinces are uniformly prohibited from planting, and the remote provinces are also designated counties to reduce production within a time limit. At the same time, opium addicts are ordered to register and gradually quit within a time limit. Extremely strict laws have been promulgated, imposing the death penalty, life imprisonment, or long-term imprisonment on those who plant, manufacture, transport, sell, or harbor and accept bribes. It is stipulated that opium cases will not be handled by the Common Court, but will be tried and executed by military judicial organs in order to expedite matters. The responsibility for the promotion, supervision, and guidance of the entire plan is personally presided over by Chairman Chiang. This is a completely different approach from the previous anti-smoking policies and is enough to show the government's determination in this regard.</p>
<p>However, the government has formulated such severe laws out of the intention to emphasize the importance of chaos and is also a necessary means. However, laws are dead, and the laws themselves will not take effect. They rely entirely on people to implement them, and it is important for the people to truly awaken and cooperate with the government to earnestly implement the anti-smoking plan. The current anti-smoking authorities have specially allowed opium addicts to register without punishment during the reporting period. This does not mean that there will be any changes or suspensions in the entire anti-smoking plan. This is to give elderly and sick opium addicts who cannot quit immediately a path to reform. It is hoped that people across the country will work together to promote and make the opium addicts understand the government's good intentions, voluntarily give up addiction as soon as possible, resolve to quit bad habits, and become good citizens again.</p>
<p>Finally, it is also hoped that the national social leaders and intellectuals will use the power of public opinion to change the psychology of the people, supplement the shortcomings of government laws, cultivate the people's positive living habits towards the light, and jointly open up a new life for the nation in the future.</p>

<p>The Anhui Provincial Government, due to the completion of the construction of the floodgates inside and outside the Huai River embankment, urgently needs to cultivate the West Lake fields in Huoqiu that have been drained. In addition to sending personnel to measure and build water conservancy projects, it has also contracted 100,000 acres to Anhui University to serve as the agricultural farm of the university's College of Agriculture. All matters related to the West Lake's project, including the reclamation and leasing of wasteland, the investigation of concealed reclamation and tax increases, and the clearing of wasteland loans, have also been handed over to the personnel dispatched by Anhui University for guidance and handling. Currently, Anhui University has dispatched Feng Zigang, director of the Agronomy Department of the university, leading more than a dozen staff members of the College of Agriculture, carrying more than 80 varieties of rice seeds entrusted to the university for testing by the National Rice and Wheat Improvement Institute, to plant them for trial. They have also requested the provincial government to borrow 20,000 yuan from the bank to purchase high-quality rice seeds along the way for planting. The president of the university, Li Shunqing, also took a steamer to Beijing on the 17th to pay a visit to the Minister of Education to discuss the opening of the Agricultural Economics Department and the enrollment of new students in the university's College of Agriculture next year. It is reported that the original plan of the university's College of Agriculture was to establish the Agronomy Department in the first year, the Agricultural Economics Department in the second year (25th year of the Republic), and the Forestry Department in the third year (26th year of the Republic) to meet the needs of Anhui Province. It is heard that President Li will proceed to Suzhou and Shanghai after completing his official business in Beijing to purchase machines and agricultural tools for sowing, deciding, planting, cultivating, and harvesting, so that they can be transported to Huoqiu for large-scale cultivation.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Education Association hosted the citywide elementary school student calligraphy competition. Representatives selected from preliminary rounds in each district held the finals yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM in the auditorium of Junyi Middle School on Jumen Road in the Nanshi district. Executive director of the association, Huang Zaoxiong, judges Tong Xingbai, Ma Gongyu, and Li Xiaobai, along with over fifty contestants from various districts, were present.</p>
<p>Chairman's Address: Chairman Huang Zaoxiong first delivered a speech, stating, "Ever since the abolition of the imperial examination and the rise of schools, students generally have rarely studied or paid attention to calligraphy. Although elementary and middle schools have calligraphy courses, they only briefly demonstrate strokes and talk about structure in a very superficial way. Therefore, modern students, even after graduating from university, still do not know what calligraphy is. Truly excellent calligraphers are rare. It should be known that calligraphy is one of the Six Arts, and is also recognized as an art form today. The Shanghai Education Association is therefore holding this elementary school student calligraphy competition to arouse a considerable understanding and interest in calligraphy among elementary school students throughout the city, encouraging them to study diligently. We also hope that elementary school student calligraphy competitions will be held in all provinces, cities, counties, townships, and villages across the country to revive calligraphy. Hopefully, this can be expected. I hope all the young friends will work harder, strive forward, and advance."</p>
<p>List of Winners: After the speech, the competition began. Each person wrote one sheet each of large and small script. The large script used the seven characters "Peace, Struggle, Save China," and the small script used Sun Yat-sen's Last Will and Testament. The allotted time was one hour. The judging results were: First, Ding Xiangyuan (Chongzheng); Second, Bo Huaying (Yongxing); Third, Shen Yuanxing (Gan Gong); Fourth, Wu Lizhi (Dunhua), Zhang Fengxiang (Fudan), Cai Ruiyao (Jinghua); Fifth, Wang Qichang (Shanghai); Sixth, Lu (Xicheng); Seventh, Guo Shurong (Shanghai), Zhang Zhongliang (Qiuzhi), Gao Chunhong (Wusong), Liu Yingda (Sanyu); Eighth, Zhao Boyun (Chengzhong); Ninth, Cai Shanghe (Ningbo No. 2 Elementary School); Tenth, Li Yiding (Jingye Affiliated Elementary School), Zhou Wensheng (Shuji). After the competition, the judges gave guidance, and then Huang Zaoxiong presented the awards.</p>

The national elite has been gathered, totaling 22 people, and the list has been reported. Selection committee member Mr. Rong Qizhao returned to Shanghai yesterday noon aboard the Empress of Russia, landing at the New Customs Wharf.

<p>It is heard that President Chiang of the Executive Yuan is very concerned about the athletes participating in this conference and has notified the National Sports Federation to convene the football team to Beijing on the 30th of this month for training and instructions. It is also scheduled to hold an exhibition match at the Capital Central Stadium on that day to satisfy the eagerness of the people in the capital.</p>

<h3 id="e137">First 30,000-Meter Relay Race: Yibing Jia Wins Championship; Time: 1 Hour, 25 Minutes, 3 Seconds, 4 Tenths; Runner-Up Hongkou Jia Also Strong <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The first 30,000-meter long-distance relay race (divided into four stages, the first stage is 5,000 meters, the second stage is 7,480 meters, the third stage is 4,228 meters, and the last stage is 4,920 meters, totaling 21,628 meters) organized by the Jingwu Athletic Association started at 10:30 AM yesterday at the west side gate of Hongkou Park. There were originally eleven teams participating, but Yibing Yi and Zhonghua Yi were absent due to temporary absences, so only nine teams actually competed. As a result, Yibing Jia had particularly complete talents and won the championship with a time of one hour, twenty-five minutes, three seconds, and five tenths. The runner-up was Hongkou Jia. The details of yesterday's race are recorded below:</p>
<p>Gu Qimin: Takes the Lead</p>
<p>At exactly 10:00 AM, the team members gathered inside the west side gate of Hongkou Park. After roll call, the second, third, and fourth runners were sent to their respective destinations by special vehicles from the Jingwu Association. At 10:30 AM, the first runners, under the gunshot of the starter Sun Huipai, moved their hairy legs. Jingwu veteran Xu Yanbo took the lead, but when he reached the intersection of Xiangyin Road, Xu Yanbo went the wrong way. When he realized it and returned, he had already gone 80 meters in the wrong direction, and was surpassed by Gu Qimin of the Yan She. The first 5,000-meter stage was completed in 19 minutes and 35 seconds.</p>
<p>Ling Xuewen: Sprints with All His Might</p>
<p>In the second stage, Yang Linfa of the Yan She took the baton and ran swiftly. After 50 meters, Ling Xuewen of Yibing Jia and Zhou Ruquan of Jingwu followed closely. Chen Zhiming of Hongkou Jia was 20 meters behind. Yang Linfa suddenly showed that his strength was slightly inferior, and before reaching Jungong Road, he was overtaken by Ling and Zhou. After passing the power plant, Ling Xuewen sprinted with all his might, surpassing Zhou Ruquan by 200 meters. At this time, Ma Riji of Zhonghua Jia showed his skills and surpassed Yang Linfa, Qian Zenglong, and Chen Zhiming from behind, and was not much different from Zhou Ruquan. At the end of the second stage, Ling Xuewen arrived first, followed by Zhou Ruquan and Ma Riji, taking 26 minutes and 12 seconds.</p>
<p>Little Zhang Liang: Runs Ahead</p>
<p>In the third stage, Zhang Liang of Yibing Jia took the baton and ran like a horse freed from its saddle, with light steps and beautiful posture along the way. Wan Jinsheng of Hongkou Jia had ample strength and, silently and without color, had moved from fifth place to second, surpassing Chen Xuzhou, Le Kangyi, and Xi Rurong. The others had no significant changes. When Zhang Liang reached the fourth stage, he left Wan Jinsheng about 500 to 600 meters behind, taking 18 minutes and 22 seconds.</p>
<p>Yibing Jia Wins the Championship</p>
<p>In the fourth stage, the championship was almost certain to go to Yibing Jia. After Wu Wenlin took the baton, he walked forward with a calm posture. Wang Rulin of Hongkou Jia tried his best to chase, but Chen Luzhou of Jingwu gradually felt unsustainable due to lack of strength in the middle. When Gu Huiyuan took over and caught up, there was a difference of 800 meters. Zhu Wenzhang of Zhonghua and Gu advanced shoulder to shoulder, and the first to reach the finish line was Wu Wenlin of Yibing Jia, with a time of 21 minutes, 63 seconds, and five tenths. Wang Rulin of Hongkou Jia fell behind by 500 meters and surrendered to second place. 150 meters behind was Wang Zhenglin of Yibing Bing. Zhu Wenzhang of Zhonghua relied on the final sprint to surpass Gu Huiyuan and reach the finish line first.</p>
<p>Jingwu Association Rewards Merit</p>
<p>After the race, the Jingwu Athletic Association prepared exquisite prizes to encourage the interest of the participating teams. The team champion, Yibing Jia, received a large silver cup, the runner-up, Hongkou Jia, the third place, Yibing Bing, and the fourth place, Zhonghua Jia, each received a silver shield. The association also awarded each of the four players of the team champion, Yibing Jia, namely Guan Youwen, Ling Xuewen, Zhang Liang, and Wu Wenlin, a small silver shield. The winning teams are listed below.</p>

<p>Preparing to participate in the World Games track and field preliminary selection to be held in Shanghai at the end of May, the Secretary General of the Sports Association, Mr. Shen Siliang, went north to consult with the Chairman of the Selection Committee, Mr. Ma Dehan, and decided to hold a preliminary selection training class at Tsinghua University in Beiping before the preliminary selection meeting, to give track and field athletes who meet the standards a full opportunity for training. Due to the extremely short distance from the preliminary selection date, it was decided to start on the 20th of this month and end on the 25th of May. The method was immediately announced and registration began. To date, the track and field stars of this city who have gone to register include Dong Shuzhao, Wang He, Wang Zhenglin, Jia Lianren, Gong Wanyu, Jiang Huairen, Zhu Guangzhi, Chen Yongan, Dai Shuguo, Fu Baolu, Zhang Jiakui, Cheng Mengping, etc., totaling twelve people.

Except for Dong and Gong, who had already gone to Beiping the day before, Jia, Jiang, Zhu, and Chen are also scheduled to depart today by through train. Wang He and Wang Zhenglin were originally scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 17th, but Zhenglin's participation in the Sino-Western Five-Team Games and the Jingwu 30,000-meter relay caused the delay. They will also leave in succession in the next few days. As for the famous generals scattered in Beijing-Hankou and other places, such as Liu Changchun, Wu Bixian, Chen Baoqiu, Bai Chunyu, Hao Chunde, etc., the Sports Association said that they have directly contacted Pingfang to avoid round-trip troubles. Women's training, due to accommodation problems, must wait until negotiations with the Tsinghua authorities are completed before a decision can be made.</p>

<p>— (Pu)</p>
<p>Society is constantly at war, always at war. This war, however, replaces weapons with intelligence. The result of the war is, of course, that people with high intelligence triumph, and people with poor intelligence fail. The impact of this is no less than that of a war with weapons. However, if people with poor intelligence hold the mentality that "the wise man may make a mistake in a thousand plans, and the foolish man may gain something in a thousand plans," and strive forward, it will not be difficult for them to have their day.</p>
<p>The process of opium smokers, from the initial intake to their death, can be described in detail with five characters "引 (yǐn), 影 (yǐng), 隱 (yǐn), 癮 (yǐn), 尹 (yǐn)" (meaning lead, shadow, conceal, addiction, tomb). Initially, they are "led" by relatives and friends to try it slightly. Soon, they are "shadowed" by its effects on their physiology. When others become suspicious and inquire, they still "conceal" it in every way, without any intention of quitting. Over time, they become "addicted," and from then on, they become weak and frail, with all kinds of diseases. As a result, they "reside" in the tomb. (Note: "尹" is a combination of "一尸," which means the corpse is carried by a wooden pole, meaning death.) Smokers who see this and are still unrepentant are not far from death even if they are not already dead.</p>
<h3 id="e151">After Qingming <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Jing</p>
<p>Although very early, in the early spring, women had already put on thin single-layer clothing, experiencing summer attire in the spring. However, that was still limited to a minority. Only after Qingming can it be uniform, with slender jade arms emerging one after another from short sleeves. At the same time, the jade legs also removed wool socks and applied powder. Open-toed high heels, coupled with nail polish surpassing the color of the countryside, seemed to be offering smiles to people.</p>
<p>Obviously, for sock factory owners, after Qingming, it is no less than enduring the most difficult non-golden age of the year. Because after Qingming, everyone has to open their mouths wide and smile desperately at the hard-working masses in the upper class. This is because after Qingming, the leaves on the willow branches all feel stuffy hiding inside and stick out to breathe. In that case, the cotton-padded jackets on the hard-working masses can also be easily taken off, replaced with lined or single-layer clothes, without shivering anymore.</p>
<p>Indeed, after Qingming, the weather is warmer. The Guanyin Festival, the Yuandi Festival, the birthday of the Great Emperor Zhang, and the old monk crossing the river, those dreadful festival reports, have all passed. The spring breeze turns lightly on the earth, promoting the growth of green grass in every corner of the earth. In the city, the pointed shoes of gentlemen and the high heels of women, harmoniously smile at the cattle and sheep gnawing grass in the fields, appearing shy and timid like the girls in the countryside.</p>
<p>No need to be timid, this is precisely the golden age for cattle and sheep, to graze on the green grass as much as possible. After Qingming, before long, the sun will gradually release its scorching heat, gradually urging the farmers to pant and sweat. Listen, the cuckoo is already calling diligently. Calling, calling, calling people to sow grains, otherwise, oh, if you don’t work, don’t complain about your stomach being upset with hunger.</p>

<p>— Gao Shu'an</p>
<p>Electrical expert Mr. Li Yanshi passed away on March 9th. Time passes quickly, and forty days have already passed in a hurry. In these forty days, I seem to have lost something, feeling confused all day long. He was my close friend, and now he is dead. But I don’t know if it’s sadness? Is it sentimentality? Or is it regret? He was only forty-four years old when he passed away, so his friends from afar sent letters inquiring about the cause of his death.</p>
<p>Yanshi fell ill on December 15th of last year. Initially, he suffered from dizziness and blurred vision, followed by increased blood pressure. Western doctors Jin Wenqi, Zang Boyong, and a certain Japanese doctor were consulted for treatment, and both acupuncture and medication were used. However, the illness continued to worsen...

On February 18th, he moved out of Baolong Hospital and returned to his residence for treatment. He took the prescriptions of Chinese medicine practitioners Zhang Yicheng, Wang Zhongqi, Xia Yingtang, and Ying Fufang. In the middle, the condition fluctuated and changed constantly. Yanshi usually had great faith in Western doctor Shen Linbo, especially as a childhood friend. Seeing this situation, he urgently telegraphed Dr. Shen Linbo in Beiping. He arrived at the residence on March 1st for treatment. Yanshi held my hand and said, "Linbo has arrived, and my illness can be entrusted to him." He also inquired about the situation of my daughter Zhifang in medical school, and said that Du He Jianhou Zhi Sun also sent letters to inquire about his condition, asking me to thank them for their kindness. However, the conclusion of Dr. Linbo's examination on this day was the same as that of other doctors, believing that the condition was extremely dangerous and could not be saved. However, his face was already swollen, and his eyes were almost blind. The condition was extremely urgent. On the evening of the 9th, I suddenly received a phone call saying that Yanshi had passed away. The body had been placed in a coffin at the Shanghai Funeral Home. Alas! Who would have expected that that meeting would become a final farewell? That night, I was extremely sad, tossing and turning, unable to sleep. The next day, I sent Yanshi's portrait to the newspaper office. When I talked to Jianhou about Yanshi's sincerity in treating others, I couldn't help but cry. (Omission below)</p>
<p>In terms of Yanshi's age, he was in his prime, handsome and formidable. He should not have died. Furthermore, with the rapid progress of China's construction now, a large number of talents are needed, and especially the current leaders, who can possess the spirit of both scholarship and courage like Mr. Yanshi, creating many careers in a short period of time and achieving great success. I am afraid that they are rare and difficult to find. And Yanshi should not have died even more today, when powerful neighbors are pressing in and the country is in serious trouble. But now Yanshi has finally died. What is the impact on society, when the coffin is closed and the final judgment is made? Not only has the electrical industry promoted a leader, but with his spirit of diligent service and meticulous work, it can also be said that we have lost a mentor. Therefore, after Yanshi's death, he earned the bitter tears of many people, and there were reasons for all of them. Now, when various groups and colleagues in the electrical industry, as well as friends from his lifetime, held a memorial meeting at the Lake Society yesterday, there were many more solemn eulogies. Alas, Yanshi! You have now shed your skin and flown away, but when I think of the past, there is only sadness, only sentimentality, no, it is also regret! (Returned thanks)</p>

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Prologue: Enjoying Chrysanthemums Near Chongyang, Seeking Seclusion in a Small Gathering, Remembering Old Dreams with Linked Pearls, Regretting a Thousand Autumns</p>
<p>I exclaimed: This female protagonist's ending is very tragic. How did she compare to Luzhu? Lanchang said: Didn't you see the four words "Supporting Tearful Eyes"? This is just a metaphor. Look at the following poem, and you will understand. I looked at the following, which said:</p>
<p>It is said that there are many waves in the Canghai Sea, and beautiful women have bad luck. Parrots are castrated because they can speak well, the evil is not self-inflicted. The mountain 　touches the mirror because it dances well, heaven is the cause. Therefore, being able to hide in a golden house does not prevent the birth of jasper in a small family. One enters the marquis’s gate, who can find the purple 　　residence.</p>
<p>It is said that good birds choose trees, not changing their hearts because they encounter nets. Fragrant grass flows with fragrance, not changing its quality because it grows in thorns. Therefore, Xu Shu left Shu, his strategy not for Wei’s plans. Li Ling served the Hu, his heart still thinking of the Han court.</p>
<p>It is said that Jingwei fills the sea, without diminishing her infatuation. The foolish old man moves mountains, and will eventually fulfill his long-cherished wish. By the peony pavilion, an allegory returns the soul of Du Nu. In the four horse gate, the former master rejoices in the mirror of Princess Lechang. Therefore, the mountains are full of blood, and the cuckoos cry everywhere in the deep night. A reed can sail, spring returns, and the swallow can finally be expected.</p>
<p>I nodded and said: It explains it very clearly, talking about the male protagonist. Then I read aloud: It is said that filial piety does not 　, having the private thought of turning the car on a fork road. People's words are fearful, holding the warning of picking up shoes in a melon field. Therefore, Song Yu of the east family, 　felt moved by being given a peach. Luo Fu on the street, ultimately feigned unfastening her sash.</p>
<p>It is said that the moon sets and the stars wane, all are due to karma. Li replaces peach, with each other for fortune and misfortune. Therefore, although the green pearl came from Jia's garden, the peacock does not fly in Zhongqing's room.</p>
<p>It is said that the Han family's trust is severed, and Mingfei's tears are secretly shed. The waist of the Chu palace is light, and the heart of Xi Gui is already broken. Therefore, facing the wall for years, keeping this body for expectations. The songs of Chu rise from all sides, lamenting the bitterness of past days.</p>
<p>I couldn't help but stomp my feet and say: This woman is pitiful! Just based on facing the wall for years, keeping this body for expectations, this person is highly admirable. Lanchang didn't say anything, just nodded. The following many poems, the words are very obscure, a guest goes to a barren garden, still leaning on green bamboo in the cold weather, horses neigh in fragrant grass, and yellow 　stand on the upper floor. Sending letters through the snow sea, willingly dying, cutting arms by cold lamps, the matter sufficient for a thousand autumns. I can still understand, all saying that this woman is good. The eighteenth poem is relatively clearer, saying:</p>
<p>It is said that singing farewell on the river bridge, thinking of the long, long cycles of life and death, the soul is broken on the upper floor, feeling the loneliness of the years. Therefore, drawing a knife to cut off water, the affection still tied to lotus silk, refining stone to cover dogs, the body unwilling to be mud (10).</p>

<p>— Feng Moni</p>
<p>Because the spring is still cold, I feel the climate is too cool. In my attic room, the cold is even more severe. Without proper clothing, it is really difficult to bear, especially since the floor is cement, making it feel even more gloomy. So, I thought of a solution, discussing it with the second landlord to move to the newly built three-story loft.</p>
<p>Although I have to bend over to walk into the three-story loft, and I often bump my head, I am very dissatisfied in my heart. However, compared to the attic room, it is much warmer, and the rent is cheaper, so I reluctantly settled down.</p>
<p>But the climate suddenly became warm, and the three-story loft was not ventilated at all, making it really stuffy. Moreover, the bedbugs lurking in the walls were already stirring, making it impossible to sleep peacefully all night. I felt uncomfortable, so I thought of moving back to the attic room.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the attic room had no tenants. I estimated that my entire property in my pocket was only four French francs. Fortunately, I still had two dollars of manuscript fees to pool together, so I moved back to the attic room. I felt comfortable, and my chest was open and happy, as if I had seen the light again.</p>
<p>Because I am always sitting in the room, I don't know what it is like outside. But when I saw the sister-in-law in the back building wearing an extremely thin silk shirt, I became a little suspicious again. Although the climate is a little warmer, summer clothes are not very suitable after all. So, I went outside to see the spring scenery and, by the way, send two manuscripts.</p>
<p>Walking on the road, I already felt dizzy. Those modern women were all wearing sleeveless long dresses, which was indeed very relaxed. Suddenly, I felt heavy. I was so confused that I didn't even feel hot wearing my broken thick cotton robe. I looked at myself, feeling a little ashamed. I didn't dare to look at others, hanging my head and running in the sunlight. Beads of sweat dripped from my forehead, making everything seem blurry, as if I didn't exist in this world.</p>

<p>When did the banks in Shanghai open? This is a question worth studying. Recently, I read Mr. Xu Yuzhi's Shanghai Miscellaneous Notes and learned that the first bank in Shanghai was Liru Bank, established in the Qing Dynasty, Daoguang twenty-ninth year. The second was McGalli Bank, founded in the Qing Dynasty, Xianfeng seventh year. Since then, the banking industry has gradually developed. Until now, the total number of banks in Shanghai is about more than fifty, which can truly be said to be the golden age of the banking industry.</p>

<p>— Lan Shan</p>
<p>The gifts between friends are originally in the heart and not in the object, so-called "a thousand miles sending a goose feather, the gift is light, but the affection is deep." However, among the responsive works, there are many that can make people burst into laughter. I will copy one or two to make the readers smile:</p>
<p>Someone gave a friend a chick to make a dish. The friend did not accept it and replied in a poem: "Yesterday, you favored me with a chick, pitifully separated from its mother not long ago. I advise you not to try it with a butcher's knife, but keep it in a cage to paint its eyebrows." Humorous and frivolous, it can be said to be appropriate.</p>
<p>There is also someone who thanked a person for giving ham, and his poem said: "The golden leg was given by my father, and the whole family laughed happily. The firewood burned three burdens, and the water reached a tank full. The meat is like withered lotus leaves, and the skin is like a broken saddle. Thirty-six teeth, each one is not peaceful." In addition to thanking, he did his best to ridicule and condemn, which is truly entertaining.</p>

<p>When I was a child, I studied at ×× Junior High School. In the Chinese class, when I read the word lust, the teacher said: "There is a knife above the word lust, so female lust should not be approached. Approaching it will lead to a murderous disaster." At that time, I was intellectually naive and only had the duty to listen, so what opinions did I have? Later, when I entered high school and read elementary school, I read this word lust again, saying that lust comes from the crowd, (section) so a person should be restrained in approaching female lust and should not be excessive. This statement is much more reasonable than the former. (Implication)</p>

<p>— Li Fumin</p>
<p>Loss of appetite is generally most easily ignored. How can you know that prolonged loss of appetite will become a weak stomach, resulting in systemic malnutrition, yellow and thin face, weak physical strength, and ultimately exhaustion, gradually entering a dangerous situation, which is regrettable.</p>
<p>Mr. Xie, who lives on Broadway, is twenty-nine years old. He engaged in strenuous exercise after a certain meal, resulting in swelling and pain. Since then, he vomits whenever he eats too much, with heaviness in his chest, acid reflux, noisy hiccups, and also constipation with a lot of farts, brain bloating and irritability. He became emaciated day by day, eventually suffering from insomnia, becoming too weak to bear. Various medicines were ineffective, so he turned to my clinic. I prescribed the German "Strong Stomach Essence." Before he finished three boxes, his appetite was greatly enhanced, and the swelling and acid noise disappeared! Because this medicine also contains spleen hormone (internal organ hormone), it is good at nourishing blood and brain, so he slept soundly and his spirits were greatly boosted after taking it. After taking five bottles in a row, his weight increased immediately, his muscles were full, and his waist and legs were light and healthy. It has not recurred for three years now. No wonder this medicine is praised as the treasure raft for stomach diseases.</p>

<p>Leukorrhea in women is a disease most abhorred by men, not only causing great physical pain, but also causing the greatest mental blow. Therefore, women with leukorrhea are very depressed and their nerves are disturbed and suffer from insomnia. At this time, the patient's vagina constantly has purulent blood flowing out. It hurts when urinating, the area is infiltrated and rotten, and a peculiar odor is emitted. Menstrual irregularities. Inability to have intercourse, and the feelings of the couple are also weakened as a result. In the end, they are rejected. Leukorrhea is really the most painful symptom for women. However, if you can use the German "Carl-Schneide vaginal tablet" early, you will definitely be able to recover soon. If you suffer from leukorrhea due to physical weakness, you can also take "Bunu Rong" to soothe your nerves and strengthen your body. If you suffer from leukorrhea due to gonorrhea, you can also take "Kelin Nong" to eliminate the gonorrhea bacteria. Both internal and external care, the effect is immediately visible, severe cases in three or four weeks, and mild cases in two or three weeks can be completely cured. Moreover, you can still have normal fertility after recovery.</p>

<p>— Chen Shaohua</p>
<p>If a cold is not treated thoroughly at the beginning, it will become a chronic cough, itchy throat, frequent coughing, unsatisfactory phlegm, chest tightness and reduced appetite, often becoming internal injuries, and turning into consumption. If you want to eliminate cough and phlegm, nourish the lungs and prevent consumption, you can only take hormone preparations made from the liver, lungs, pancreas and other organs of turtles, flatfish, bears and deer: "Pulmonary Nal". This medicine is good at treating colds and all stubborn coughs and phlegm and children's whooping cough. It is suitable for taking in the first, second and third stages of pulmonary tuberculosis. Moreover, it is rich in lecithin, which can increase the Golgi body in the body. It is most effective for smokers' phlegm and elderly asthma. If used to quit smoking, it can also quickly break the addiction. Because the medicine is mild, more and more people are taking it, and I am also most happy to use this medicine in clinical practice, and I can quickly get wonderful results.</p>
<h3 id="e168">The Most Reliable Preparation for Treating Gonorrhea <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Since the spread of gonorrhea, there has been a saying that there is no medicine to cure gonorrhea. Although there are many researchers, the invention of gonorrhea medicine is rare and the effect is weak, so today, gonorrhea medicine has almost lost the trust of patients, which is true for chronic patients! In fact, the components of previous gonorrhea medicines are all diuretic products such as cubeb, and taking them often causes kidney disorders, leading to other diseases. And their effect in treating gonorrhea is only temporary, and it is difficult to cure it permanently. Drug dealers only know how to seek profit, and do not hesitate to make exaggerated publicity, misleading patients, and causing no small harm. This is why the old gonorrhea medicines are losing their credibility and becoming obsolete. However, since the successful invention of the German gonorrhea holy medicine "Kelin Nong", all gonorrhea and turbidity can be eradicated by taking it. It has been repeatedly verified by famous hospitals and doctors in various countries and is indeed proven. I do not need to guarantee it with my personality. "Kelin Nong's" curative effect is based on Schweellenreizlherapie, which can promote the body's self-activating anti-gonorrhea activity according to each person's cellular ability, so the success is very great! Its raw material is a specific protein, Perutz has done experiments on this protein, that is, chronic and stubborn gonorrhea testicles and arthritis can also be reduced in a short period of time with this medicine, and the turbidity is stopped and the urine is clear. Therefore, as soon as this medicine came out, it spread without being promoted, and it was popular in various countries. All the old gonorrhea medicines were defeated!</p>

<p>How to Cure Chronic Leukorrhea Early</p>
<p>Leukorrhea is not difficult to treat, but the reason why it becomes difficult to treat is that the patient delays treatment, and the treatment is not thorough, thus becoming a difficult disease. Once gonorrhea bacteria enter a chronic state, our body also produces an antitoxic effect, so the pain is not as severe as in the acute stage. However, these gonorrhea bacteria are always at risk of infecting others, such as developing gonorrhea within a week after contact with the opposite sex.</p>
<p>This situation is often seen in married couples. For example, Mr. Lu Runting suffered from gonorrhea six years ago. He was treated by famous doctors, but it was not cured. Later, it turned into prostatitis and urethral stricture, perineal dull pain, and both urination and ejaculation felt severe pain, sometimes even spasticity. His wife also suffered from leukorrhea, vaginal pain, purulent blood exchange, local redness and swelling, and menstruation was also difficult as a result. Later, Mr. Lu purchased the "Complete Book of Venereal Diseases" from the Great Eastern Bookstore and came to ask for treatment. In addition to prostate massage and electrical therapy, he took the German "Kelin Nong" internally to clear urine, kill bacteria, reduce inflammation and relieve pain. He recovered completely in five weeks. His wife's leukorrhea was also instructed by me to use the "Carl-Schneide vaginal tablet" externally, one tablet inserted deep into the vagina every night to remove leukorrhea, and "Kelin Nong" internally to eliminate bacteria. She also stopped the leukorrhea and pain in six weeks. After taking "Bunu Rong" for a month, menstruation came on time. Both couples underwent blood serum tests, and there was no gonorrhea reaction. It can be seen that this kind of chronic leukorrhea, if not treated together, would be difficult to achieve such a rapid effect and would not recur after recovery.</p>

<p>The reason for the unhealthy sexual tissues of both sexes is actually due to excessive masturbation and sexual activity, and the lack of hormones in the blood, resulting in weak reproductive power. Therefore, it is obvious in the reproductive organs. If you want to save it, you must supplement the hormone's ability. German Merlin has spent his life inventing "Souti Kang" made from the testicular hormones of male lions, tigers, sea dogs, etc. in puberty, and "Bunu Rong" made from female ovarian hormones to treat unhealthy male and female tissues, which has special effects. Mr. Shan, who lives on Sima Road, committed masturbation at an early age, resulting in underdevelopment, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, small sexual organs, kidney atrophy and weakness, weak memory, haggard complexion, heart palpitations, insomnia, dizziness and tinnitus, and inability to have intercourse after marriage. The couple had no feelings to speak of, and Mr. Shan's weight decreased day by day, and his decline increased frequently. Fortunately, his friend Mr. Sun Chunfu introduced him to my treatment. In addition to surgery to correct the pathological state, he immediately took a large amount of "Souti Kang." After half a month, his reproductive function had an erection phenomenon. After taking it for more than a month, all the diseases were cured, and his reproductive development had reached soundness. The couple's love has become more complete as a result. Mr. Shan often said that "Souti Kang" has the power to seize the creation of heaven. As for women's irregular menstruation, infertility, etc., I have used "Bunu Rong" to cure no less than thousands of people. And they have gained red faces and moist muscles, plump breasts, high chicken heads, and the thin ones have become slender, healthy and beautiful, and have entered the typical era of beauty. Its tonic power is really magnificent.</p>

He immediately took a few more bottles with peace of mind in order to cure it completely. His dear friend Ms. Hu was also suffering from dry cough and thinness, and irregular menstruation. Mr. Cao took her to my clinic; I instructed her to take "Pulmonary Nal" and also to take the German "Bunu Rong" to regulate menstruation and nourish blood in order to become strong. She also achieved good results.

<p>— Sen Yu</p>
<p>Recently, the income tax issue has been widely discussed. Since legislator Ma Shichu repeatedly advocated that fiscal policy should first implement income tax during this extraordinary period, this issue has attracted much attention from all parties. It is also heard that the Central Finance Committee and the Economic Committee have scheduled a meeting within days to discuss the issue, and concrete measures are expected to emerge soon.</p>
<p>What exactly is income tax?</p>
<p>So, what exactly is income tax? Let's give a brief overview:</p>
<p>Income tax is a tax directly levied by the state on the economic net income (income) of individuals or legal entities within a certain period. It is a personal tax, and its general advantages are: Wide tax coverage, unlike other taxes such as land tax, house tax, and business tax, which are mostly limited to local areas. Fair burden, regardless of whether it is a direct tax or an indirect tax, all proportional tax systems place a heavy burden on the poor and a light burden on the rich, completely ignoring the ability of citizens to pay taxes. Income tax clearly has its characteristics. One is to distinguish the amount of income, which is called "progressive taxation." The higher the income, the higher the tax rate, so the burden on the wealthy class is heavier. This is even more pronounced on excess income tax. The so-called excess income tax refers to an additional tax with a high progressive rate levied on total income from all sources that exceeds a certain amount, in addition to the ordinary income tax. It is also called additional income tax. The second is to distinguish the nature of income, which is called "differentiation." The most important is to reduce the tax rate on earned income and increase the tax rate on property income, so that the burden on those who gain without labor is increased. Stable income: reliable income is generated during each fixed period. Flexible, most taxes are not easy to change at any time, so the government's policy cannot be implemented when necessary. However, income tax has considerable flexibility. Tax rates can be lowered during peacetime, and it is also easier to change tax rates when necessary, such as during wartime. Tax rates can be increased separately based on the ability of taxpayers at all levels, making it easier for the government to raise emergency funds.</p>
<p>Types of Income Tax and Taxation Methods</p>
<p>Income tax can be divided into the following two categories due to the different standards and scope of collection methods:</p>
<p>Comprehensive Income Tax Comprehensive income tax, also known as general income tax or total income tax, does not consider the source of income, but combines the income of individuals or legal entities from all sources and taxes it based on the total amount. This is the so-called comprehensive taxation system. Its advantage is that progressive rates are easy to achieve and the burden is particularly fair. However, its disadvantage is that it is not easy to conduct investigations and comprehensive work satisfactorily, which often leads to many malpractices. Therefore, without a sound administrative system, it will have unfair tendencies.</p>
<p>Source Income Tax Source income tax, also known as partial or individual income tax, classifies all income according to its categories. Some still require the use of investigation and estimation methods, but some can be deducted in advance from the payer. The advantage is that countries that cannot tax all income at the same time can gradually adopt it, so as not to be too hasty. However, classifying by category may increase collection procedures and costs, and because the effectiveness of progressive rates is reduced, the burden may not always be completely fair.</p>
<p>The above classifies income tax based on the overall scope of taxation methods. Now, we briefly describe various different taxation methods:</p>
<p>Declaration Method This is where taxpayers declare their income within a certain period. Generally, at the end of each year, taxpayers submit various account books to the local competent authority or collection agency for review by the Investigation Committee, which determines the tax based on the account books. However, the determination of the income amount must deduct this year's expenses, last year's surplus, various public taxes, insurance premiums, and reserve funds from the total income. This method requires a perfect accounting system; otherwise, there will be incidents of overreporting and collusion between officials and the public.</p>
<p>External Standard Estimation Method This is to estimate the amount of income based on external standards, and then calculate the amount of tax payable. The advantage of this method is that the procedures are relatively convenient and it can avoid the overreporting in the declaration method. However, there are also disadvantages, such as the difficulty in accurately and fairly estimating the work, and it is easy to collude and commit fraud.</p>
<p>Source Method This is used for salaries, rents, interest, etc., where the income has a definite source. It is extracted from the payer before the income is owned. The most obvious advantages of this method are reducing procedures, preventing tax evasion, and ensuring accurate amounts. However, there are also disadvantages. The result of separate taxation reduces the effectiveness of progressive tax rates.</p>
<p>The above three methods have both advantages and disadvantages. The method to adopt should be considered based on the specific circumstances of each country.</p>
<p>The Difference between Income Tax and Revenue Tax</p>
<p>What should be noted here is the distinction between income tax and revenue tax. There has been much debate over the two terms income tax and revenue tax; and on the surface, income and revenue seem similar, so they are often confused. However, if we can examine the nature of the two, it is not difficult to find their differences. Let's give a brief overview:</p>
<p>Although the tax sources of income tax and revenue tax are the same, the basis for taxation is different. Income tax is based on the income of people with income, while revenue tax is based on the revenue of things with income. Therefore, income tax is aimed at people and is called a personal tax, while revenue tax is aimed at things and is called a property tax. Naturally, it is difficult to strictly distinguish between people and things. Income tax is universal, and all income that meets the tax standards must be taxed. Revenue tax is not universal and is limited to certain specific revenues. The means of collecting revenue tax is general. It does not necessarily use net income as the standard, and often directly determines the tax amount based on gross revenue. Income tax must deduct various expenses and other public taxes paid by the person concerned in order to obtain such revenue, and only tax his net surplus income. In addition, income tax often takes into account various personal circumstances to determine different tax amounts, such as the difference between single and married people, and between those with and without debt.</p>
<p>The Evolution of the Income Tax Issue in China</p>
<p>Since income tax is a modern tax with abundant income, universal taxation, fair burden, and flexibility, most countries have already implemented it and are making increasing progress. It has occupied an important position in the tax system and is the main source of fiscal revenue. The earliest was the United Kingdom, which had already started collecting it in 1798; followed by the United States, which started in 1862; in addition, Italy, Germany, Japan, etc. all implemented it in the second half of the 19th century. Only France was later, deciding to adopt income tax in 1914 and officially implementing it in 1916. The following is a table listing the period of implementation of income tax in various countries and the percentage of income tax in total tax revenue (as of 1932):</p>
<p>As for China, although the call for collecting income tax had already been raised in the late Qing Dynasty, and the Republic of China has repeatedly decided to formulate regulations, until now, except for the collection of deformed party income donations from civil servants of various government agencies, it has not been formally implemented. The evolution of the income tax issue in the Republic of China can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>According to investigation, at the beginning of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Finance, due to the financial difficulties of the national treasury, was determined to prepare for income tax, but it was repeatedly discussed and stopped, and no concrete plan was ever presented. In January of the third year, the 27 articles of the Income Tax Regulations were finally promulgated, and the estimated income was 2,175,000 yuan, which was added to the budget of the second year of the Republic of China, but it was not implemented. In August of the fourth year, because the scope of the originally established Income Tax Regulations was too broad and the procedures were too cumbersome, it was deeply felt that it was impossible to suddenly collect all kinds of income in the same period, so the first phase of the Income Tax Implementation Rules was formulated, preparing to promote it in stages, starting with officials, parliamentarians, and large businesses with more profits. It was decided that the former would be collected using the source method and the latter would be collected using the declaration method. The estimated budget number for the fifth year was included in 2,835,000 yuan, which seemed to have reached a concrete stage. Unexpectedly, in the end, it was still shelved due to domestic turmoil. In the eighth year of the Republic of China, the authorities felt that the tax rate of the first phase of the Implementation Rules was too high, and decided to abolish it. They formulated the amount of taxes to be collected in order and asked the provincial finance departments to estimate them separately, and stipulated that the income tax funds should be used for education and industry. In January of the tenth year of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Finance again announced the Implementation Rules of the Income Tax Regulations, the income tax collection tax items, the Income Tax Investigation and Review Committee Rules of Procedure, the Income Tax Collection Rules, the Income Tax Funds Storage and Allocation Regulations, etc. At that time, all provinces in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, and Hubei had already determined the numbers. It was originally planned to be implemented from the first day of the month, but the provincial councils and chambers of commerce telegraphed to request a delay, which was extended for three months and eventually became indefinite.</p>
<p>After the establishment of the National Government, the discussion of collecting income tax arose again. In October of the 17th year of the Republic of China, the steps for handling income tax were stipulated. In January of the 18th year of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Finance revised and announced the Income Tax Regulations of the third year of the Republic of China, and revised the previous Income Tax Implementation Rules separately according to the main points of the revised regulations. However, after the promulgation of the revised regulations and implementation rules, actual collection was still not achieved. However, there is one thing we should pay attention to, that is, the income donation for civil servants implemented since the 16th year of the Republic of China, with an average monthly total of about 300,000 yuan. This indeed has a government official income tax similar to the income tax system, but the scope is too narrow after all, and the tax funds are used for local party departments, which has no relation to the central fiscal revenue, so it can only be regarded as a transitional deformed nature.</p>
<p>Until the summer of last year (24th year of the Republic of China), the government authorities finally felt that it was necessary to implement income tax in order to strengthen finance and improve the tax system. Therefore, they again consulted the previous established cases and drafted the new Provisional Regulations on Income Tax, totaling 31 articles. Initially, it was prepared to be implemented from July 1st, so 5 million yuan was included in the budget for the 24th year of the Republic of China; but it was decided to postpone it to January 1st of this year. However, the result is that it is still under discussion.</p>
<p>So, what is the reason for the delay? According to our investigation, it seems that it is roughly due to the following points: Political Disunity Incomplete Household Survey Lack of Bookkeeping Organization and other Technical Aspects Undeveloped Industry and Commerce Obstruction by Domestic Evil Forces Obstruction by Foreigners.</p>
<p>How to Implement it in the Future?</p>
<p>The above-mentioned obstacles have not been completely overcome now, and it is probably not very easy to resolve them in the near future. However, we cannot continue to follow the old ways. If we stubbornly wait for all the conditions to be met, hoping for a time without any difficulties, without making efforts to promote it, it is tantamount to waiting for a rabbit to bump into a tree, and there will never be a day to realize it.</p>
<p>So, how to implement it? Let us contribute some opinions:</p>
<p>Taxation Area Due to domestic political and economic constraints, and the difficulty of quickly completing the investigation work, it may not be possible to immediately implement a unified national income tax. It may be a good idea to change the method, collecting taxes by region; or starting with several provinces in the southeast, with the nature of a pilot project, improving it at any time, gradually expanding it, and finally promoting it to the whole country. However, the faster the promotion process, the better; otherwise, it will form a long-term inequality and the phenomenon of inter-provincial tax evasion. I believe that at most, it should be divided into four phases, with each phase lasting half a year. After two years, it must be popularized throughout the country. After two years of experience, various procedures should have a considerable clue, which will be easier than in the initial stage. Second, in order to avoid deliberate obstruction from various provinces to the central government, a certain percentage of the income tax funds may be allocated to local governments, so as to achieve the effect of cooperation between the central government and local governments. Although this is not in line with administrative unity and tax revenue unity, in special circumstances, it has to be regarded as a temporary transitional method in the absence of a better solution. However, if an extraordinary period is imminent, there is no need to be bound by the established phased procedure, and extraordinary means should be used to immediately promote it in all parts of the country.</p>
<p>Taxation Scope In the initial stage, various conditions are lacking, and it is impossible to cover all income at once, so it is necessary to promote it gradually. This is correct. However, the procedure can be researched. The scope of the recently promulgated Provisional Regulations on Income Tax is too narrow: The first category is the income of companies, shops, firms, factories, and temporary profit-making businesses; the second category is the income of salaries and remuneration; the most important asset income is not included here. Because land rents and house rents in asset income already have considerable local taxes (such as house donations, land taxes, and their surtaxes), it is true that income tax should be levied slowly before reaching a proper solution with the provinces (but excess income tax can be used for large landlords). However, the following types of income must be taxed at the same time, and it is not the most difficult technically: Income from government bond interest Income from deposit interest Dividend income of shareholders of large enterprises Excess income of the wealthy. If these incomes are not taxed, all the advantages of income tax, such as "universal collection," "fair burden," "sufficient income," and "flexibility," will be completely eliminated, and there will be no talk of using it as a source of emergency funds.</p>
<p>Taxation Method Due to the difficulty of investigation work and the fact that the taxation scope cannot cover all income at once, China cannot implement a comprehensive taxation system and should adopt a source taxation system, except for collecting excess income tax. As for how to tax when implementing source income tax, I think there is no need to stick to a single type, and it is better to choose a convenient and flexible one: Income from salaries and remuneration, and income from house rents can adopt the "source method;" income from companies, shops, firms, and factories with a more complete accounting organization can adopt the "declaration method;" income from freelance professionals and land rent can adopt the "external standard estimation method." In addition, the tax collection agency may entrust local governments and other existing tax collection agencies to collect or bring taxes on their behalf within the possible scope to save expenses.</p>
<p>Tax Rate At the beginning, the tax rate should not be too high or too low, and it should be closely related to the size of the income. The income tax regulations for the first category of profitable business income starting at 5% is appropriate, but the capital standard is set at 3,000 or more, which seems to be too burdensome for small businesses and should be changed to 5,000 yuan. The second category of salary and remuneration income starting at 600 yuan also seems to be too burdensome for small incomes and should be changed to 1,000 yuan. As for the starting point for tax, they are all set at 10 per mille, which is appropriate, but the progressive rate is too low, and the highest 200 per mille for large incomes would not be too harsh even if it were doubled. The aforementioned asset income tax and excess income tax should increase the tax rate further based on the principle of heavily taxing unearned income. In short, the burden on large income earners must be increased, which is naturally allowed during extraordinary periods. As for some people's claim that the tax rate should be differentiated based on the individual circumstances of the taxpayer, such as the number of family members and the existence of debt, China seems to be unable to consider this temporarily in the initial stage due to the complexity of the investigation work.</p>
<p>Relationship with other Taxes After the implementation of salary and remuneration income, the existing agency party income donations should be cancelled. All surtaxes on land and houses should be discussed with the provincial authorities to reduce or exempt them, and replace them with income tax in the short term. Business tax and other taxes that conflict too much with income tax should be adjusted. In addition, what should be implemented at the same time as income tax is inheritance tax.</p>
<p>Difficult Problems According to the above-mentioned methods, technical difficulties are secondary, and the most annoying is the obstruction of domestic evil forces and the restrictions of foreigners. The income in China, especially those with asset income, are directly or indirectly mostly powerful people. They try in every possible way to reduce the level of the progressive rate, and they must not include asset income in the scope of taxation. The reason why the recently promulgated regulations have such low levels and do not include asset income is also due to their activities to some extent. As for the foreign obstruction, it will often produce the phenomenon of tax evasion and even capital flight, which has a great impact on the future of China's income tax. The way to break this is not simply to eliminate all of them from the diplomatic perspective. The existing customs tax evasion problem has not yet been resolved, and the newly established income tax will inevitably have more trouble. Therefore, in order to make China's income tax progress smoothly, these two obstacles must be thoroughly eliminated, but it is not easy. Then, the taxpayers are generally small incomes that cannot be evaded, how can they be fair and universal?</p>
<p>In short, the necessity of China's income tax has been denied by anyone. The question is how to implement it? As for the issue of income tax and extraordinary finance, we naturally dare not assert that collecting income tax can solve the difficulties of extraordinary finance. But at least, it is an undeniable fact that income tax has a great auxiliary effect on extraordinary finance.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Review of Inheritance Tax <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Zeng Yun</p>
<p>Recently, the Ministry of Finance plans to levy income tax and inheritance tax. The former regulations have already been promulgated, and the latter are also under drafting. If there are no obstacles, they can be implemented. This is of course an important move in balancing national revenue and expenditure, and inheritance tax is the most reasonable and fair good tax under the modern private property system! Literally speaking, the so-called inheritance tax seems to be a very simple matter, just levying a certain amount of tax on the property left by someone. However, in practice, the procedures for levy and the standards for taxation are very complicated. It is one of the most difficult taxes to handle well. Even a slight omission can lead to adverse results.</p>
<p>Regarding the inheritance tax itself, there is a distinction between total inheritance tax and individual inheritance tax; regarding the geographical standard for taxation, there are differences based on the location of the property (inheritance location), based on the person (location of the deceased or heir), and based on nationality; regarding the object of the heir, there is a distinction between close relatives and distant relatives; regarding the standard of the tax rate, there are proportional tax rates and progressive tax rates, and within progressive tax rates, there is a difference between so-called full-amount progression and excess progression; in addition, the division of tax brackets, the provisions for tax exemption points, and those who are tax-exempt all require careful consideration and planning. To clarify the content of inheritance tax, it is necessary for us to briefly describe the above points.</p>
<p>Total inheritance tax and individual inheritance tax: the former taxes the total inheritance and has the nature of a property tax; the latter taxes each distribution of the inheritance and is in the nature of an unearned income tax. These two methods each have advantages and disadvantages. The total inheritance system simplifies the administrative procedures and saves collection costs, and the progressive rate increases relatively, and the tax-free amount decreases absolutely, which can increase tax revenue significantly. However, this contains an unfair element for the inheritance tax paying group, because taxing the total inheritance with the same standard will cause those who receive less to suffer a lot. On the other hand, the individual inheritance system must separately stipulate whether there is a tax-free amount and the level of the progressive rate. The procedure is cumbersome, but from the perspective of the inheritance beneficiary class, the burden seems fairer. Currently, various countries, such as Japan and Germany, purely adopt the individual inheritance system (Germany created a total inheritance system in 1919, but abolished it after 1922 and included it in the individual inheritance system), while the United Kingdom and France adopt both total and individual systems. The United States has the total inheritance tax under federal jurisdiction and the individual inheritance tax under state jurisdiction. It is said that only British Columbia (British Columbia) solely adopts the total inheritance system.</p>
<p>Geographical Standard of Taxation This is the most troublesome issue in the collection of inheritance tax. When inheritance is transferred, complex situations often arise where the deceased and the heirs are located in different places. Therefore, there are many tax standards. Some are based on the address of the deceased, some are based on the address of the heir, some are based on the nationality of the deceased, and some are based on the location of the property. The interpretation of the address of the deceased and the heir varies from place to place, so there are often instances of double taxation. Sometimes, the same property is taxed in location A, location B, and even location C. This phenomenon is most common in the United States. The laws of each state in the United States do not uniformly interpret the geographical standard, so sometimes when the deceased is in state A, the heir is in state B, and the inheritance is in state C, states A, B, and C can each levy taxes according to their own tax rates. As for solely using the location of the property as the standard, it is indeed much clearer, but it is not without problems. For example, if someone leaves stocks of a certain company, and the company has property in several places, then the situation becomes complicated. In addition, due to differences in international legislation, it is often impossible to avoid the phenomenon of double taxation of inheritance tax. Although various countries are currently trying to find ways to eliminate this difficulty, they have not found a reliable solution because international coordination has not been universal and thorough.</p>
<p>Relationship Between the Deceased and the Heirs The inheritance tax rates in most countries are based on the closeness of the relationship between the deceased and the heirs, with distant relatives being taxed more than close relatives. They believe that close relatives are entitled to it, while distant relatives are incidental. France divides into eleven classes, the United Kingdom divides into five classes, and Japan distinguishes between family head inheritance and general inheritance, with the tax rate for family head inheritance being lower than that for general inheritance. The above-mentioned method of dividing into classes for taxation is undoubtedly accurate and fair among inheritance tax payers. However, it also has considerable shortcomings, namely, the procedures are too troublesome. Because of the distinction between close and distant relatives, the standards for tax exemption amounts, the level of progressive rates, etc., must be stipulated separately. What is likely to happen is to increase the tax evasion by cunning people. For example, the inheritance that distant relatives should receive can often be represented by close relatives in name to enjoy a lighter tax rate.</p>
<p>Standard of Tax Rates Making the tax rate appropriate is another heavy task. The standards on which tax rates are based generally include the following: the size of the inheritance tax; that is, according to the amount of the inheritance, divide it into several classes, each class specifying a different tax rate, generally using a progressive method to increase it, and stipulating a minimum point and a maximum point. The relationship between the deceased and the heirs; as mentioned above, some also differentiate into several different tax brackets based on the degree of kinship. Whether there are children or how many there are; this is probably a special development under the social policy of encouraging population growth. The inheritance tax laws in France have different tax rates depending on whether there are children or how many there are. Those with four children can even be exempted from total inheritance tax. In addition, there is the so-called determination of the tax rate based on the turnover of the inheritance, such as the Italian E. Rignano, who advocated that the first inheritance tax rate should be the lightest, and the second and third times... the rate would gradually increase. However, this method is close to an ideal, and there are many practical difficulties, so no country has adopted it. First, the original property and the newly added property after inheritance are easily mixed together and cannot be accurately identified; second, the previous heir may deliberately consume the original property under the inheritance; third, the price of property changes indefinitely, which will affect future tax relations. As for the pre-payment method advocated by the Englishman Daton, that is, the first heir, in addition to paying the inheritance tax that he should originally bear, will also pre-pay the tax amount for the second inheritance, and the state will give a considerable interest every year before the second inheritance is implemented; although this is already more concrete, it may not be easy to handle.</p>
<p>Full Progression vs. Excess Progression Generally speaking, taxation is divided into proportional tax rates and progressive tax rates, but the inheritance tax method is ultimately progressive. This is because the direct tax of inheritance tax is unearned income, and only by levying it at a progressive tax rate can true fairness be achieved. However, there is a distinction between full progression (adopted by the United Kingdom, Germany, etc.) and excess progression (adopted by France, Japan, the United States, etc.) in the progressive method. The advantages and disadvantages of the two are mutually evident. Full progression is simpler and generates more revenue, but it has an unfair phenomenon; excess progression is the opposite. For example: the amount of A's inheritance is 20,000 yuan, and the tax rate is 1%, so the tax payable is 200 yuan, and the actual amount is 19,800 yuan; the amount of B's inheritance is 20,010 yuan, and the tax rate is 1.5%. If calculated according to full amount progression, the tax payable is 300 yuan and 15 cents, and the actual amount is 19,699 yuan and 85 cents, the actual amount of the latter is less than that of the former. However, the excess progressive levy is different, that is, 20,010 yuan, 10,000 yuan is calculated according to the 1% tax rate, the tax amount is 200 yuan, and only 10 yuan is calculated according to 1.5%, the tax amount is 15 cents, totaling 200 yuan and 15 cents, and the actual amount can be 19,809 yuan and 85 cents.</p>
<p>Scope of Tax The standards for the provision of tax-free scope are roughly the following: (1) Based on the amount of inheritance: that is, the law stipulates a tax-free standard point. Those who are less than a certain amount are tax-free, and those who exceed a certain amount are taxed at a rate. There are many ways to implement it: some stipulate that if the amount of inheritance exceeds the set tax-free point, the entire inheritance will be taxed, and the original tax-free amount will no longer be deducted (adopted by Japan, Germany, etc.), and some only tax the excess part, such as if the amount of inheritance is 4,000 yuan and the tax-free point is 3,000 yuan, then only the excess part of 1,000 yuan will be taxed, and 3,000 yuan will be excluded (adopted by the United States, France, etc.). There is also the so-called Vanishing exemption, such as if the original tax-free point is 3,000 yuan, but if it exceeds 1 yuan, 1 yuan will be reduced. At this time, the tax-free amount becomes 1,999 yuan, and the taxable inheritance is 2 yuan. When the excess amount reaches 3,000 yuan (that is, when the inheritance amount is 6,000 yuan), the tax-free amount will be cancelled, and the entire 6,000 yuan will be taxed (adopted by the Federation of South Africa, etc.). (2) Determined according to the nature of the inheritance beneficiary; if the inheritance is donated to charity and other public undertakings, it is generally tax-free. (3) Determined according to the number of children; this is a special treatment under the social policy of a country. For example, France, in order to encourage population growth, exceptionally gives tax reductions or exemptions to those with more children. (4) Determined according to the nature of the deceased; that is, the inheritance of personnel who died in action or were injured and died due to battlefield service in the army, navy, and air force is exempt from tax.</p>
<p>Object of Inheritance The types of inheritance can include all real and personal property, land, houses, inventory, cash, deposits, loans, bills, accounts receivable, interest receivable, as well as certificates representing property interests or business profits, commercial, patent rights, trademark rights, copyright, etc. However, when taxing, the debts of the deceased, unpaid mortgages, and various taxes and public charges payable should be deducted, as well as insurance premiums, funeral expenses, necessary expenses for managing and distributing the inheritance and executing the will, as well as accidental losses, etc. As for whether the education expenses of minor heirs should be deducted, it depends on the education policy of each country.</p>
<p>The above points are important items that must be understood when discussing inheritance tax issues; as for how to implement it, there is naturally no fixed mechanical standard, and it must be considered according to the actual situation of each country.</p>
<p>Now, let us further look at the draft inheritance tax regulations drafted by the Ministry of Finance. Combining the contents of each chapter and article, the most important points can be obtained as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Abandoning the individual inheritance system and adopting the total inheritance system;</p>
<p>(2) Taxing regardless of the closeness of inheritance;</p>
<p>(3) Adopting the location of the property in the country and nationality abroad as the standard for taxation;</p>
<p>(4) Setting the tax-free point at 3,000 yuan, but the Executive Yuan revised it to 5,000 yuan after review;</p>
<p>(5) Adopting the excess progressive system, with a minimum of 1% and a maximum of 24%, but those exceeding 10 million yuan will be taxed at 5% for each additional million yuan;</p>
<p>Organize an inheritance review committee; Let us briefly review the above six points:</p>
<p>The advantages and disadvantages of the individual inheritance system and the total inheritance system have been mentioned above, but China should temporarily adopt the total inheritance system. At present, China's financial and administrative technology is backward, so it should avoid being overly meticulous; China's property system and will system have not yet been popularized, and the collection procedures of the individual inheritance system are too complicated; China does not yet have a property tax. If the individual inheritance system is implemented, it seems too abrupt in the procedure, and the total inheritance system can also fulfill the task of a property tax. However, no matter whether the total inheritance system or the individual inheritance system is adopted, a sound household registration system is a necessary prerequisite. If China's household registration census cannot be completed precisely, it will hinder the collection of inheritance tax, which is extremely serious.</p>
<p>Inheritance is originally unearned income, and in reality, there is no such thing as entitled or incidental. Therefore, when taxing, it is indeed not necessary to distinguish between the closeness of inheritance. Moreover, as mentioned above, China's financial and administrative technology has not been sound, and these complicated classification tasks are difficult to undertake. It is still possible that various malpractices will occur in the future, such as concealment of tax evasion, etc.; it is better to abandon complexity and choose simplicity.</p>
<p>The taxation standard excludes the address, and adopts the location of the property in the country and nationality abroad: as explained in the draft regulations, it has the advantage of combining the advantages of both personal and territorial principles, and can avoid the drawbacks of mutual discrimination in various places. However, there are still things that have not been clearly stated and have become questions, such as the company stocks with property in several places mentioned above, which place should be used as the standard? In addition, whether the taxation of the inheritance of foreigners in China can proceed smoothly is probably still a problem.</p>
<p>Whether the tax-free point of 3,000 yuan or 5,000 yuan is a compromise in principle, but whether it is necessary to reconsider it in light of the current distribution of property among the Chinese people is another question. However, whether the education expenses of adult heirs should be deducted and included in the tax-free list is not mentioned in the draft regulations. In my humble opinion, since China's free education has not yet been popularized, it seems that a deduction should be added.</p>
<p>The excess progressive rate is fairer, which is undoubtedly undeniable; but in my humble opinion, it is not necessary to mechanically and completely treat everyone the same. It seems unnecessary to give this kind of preferential treatment to those with larger inheritance amounts. The full amount progressive rate can be used for those above 100,000 yuan, and the excess progressive rate can still be used for those below 100,000 yuan, that is, both the full amount progressive system and the excess progressive system can be adopted. As for the progressive rate, the set rate is also too low, and it may be appropriate to increase it slightly. I hope that the legislative authorities will study it in detail during the review.</p>
<p>The review committee is a necessary institution, but its work is very complicated; if the investigation and evaluation work is missed, it will not only affect government tax revenue, but also often produce corruption phenomena. Especially the valuation of land, houses, goodwill, patent rights, trademark rights, copyright, etc., is even more difficult. In addition, it is also very possible for the review committee and taxpayers to collude in fraud.</p>
<p>In short, inheritance tax is the best of all taxes, but it is also the most difficult to handle precisely and thoroughly. China's inheritance tax is still in its infancy, and the difficulties encountered must be many. Now we put forward the minimum hope: the tax rate is not too low; the investigation and evaluation must be accurate; we must absolutely prevent fraud and tax evasion; we must eliminate all unreasonable obstacles, and implement it as soon as possible; the tax revenue should be used for proper construction and educational undertakings. Finally, I have to reiterate that if the household registration census cannot be done thoroughly, I am afraid that the results of inheritance tax collection will not be optimistic.</p>

<h3 id="e178">Eradicating Opium and National Rejuvenation <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Pan Gongzhan</p>
<p>The strong bully the weak, the chaotic are insulted and perish. These are ancient Chinese idioms; survival of the fittest, natural selection, these are modern social evolution theories. Corruption breeds worms. Although this is not logically correct in science, it has considerable truth in meaning. Therefore, if a person wants to have a considerable position in society, to be self-reliant and not be eliminated, the basic conditions are to work hard, strive, and not have weaknesses that can be attacked by others; otherwise, if one cannot be invigorated and merely hopes to survive by luck, one will eventually tend towards failure. This is true for individuals, and it is also true for countries and nations.</p>
<p>The strength of modern countries does not depend on the hard work of a few people, but is created by the vast majority of outstanding people in the country. In the past, power was concentrated in the hands of a few people or the emperor. If the few people or the emperor were wise and enlightened, the country could become strong at any time, because the absolute majority of the people were ignorant and obedient and listened to the commands of one person or a few people. If the emperor or a few people were foolish and incompetent, the country would also decline. The historical records of the rise and fall of dynasties and the prosperity and decline of nations are mostly due to this reason. However, in modern countries, power is in the hands of the majority of the people, and the fate of the country and nation depends on the quality of each member that constitutes the country and nation. If the members of the organization are not good, then the entire organization will not be sound. For example, in the human body, how can one expect the whole body to be healthy if the cells are not healthy? Although Germany was defeated in the European War, it regained its position in Europe today in less than twenty years. Some say that it was Hitler's hard work and determination that enabled Germany to revive. However, this is just a superficial observation. Without the support of the excellent German nation, even if Hitler held power, it would only be for a few years. Even with natural talent and strong will, how could he enable the once-defeated German nation to re-enter the ranks of European powers in the shortest possible time?</p>
<p>Since the Opium War, the majority of the Chinese people have been immersed in the atmosphere of opium and drugs for nearly a century. In these hundred years, I don't know how many aspiring young people have been buried, and I don't know how many promising people have been buried. The impoverishment of individuals and the decline of the national spirit are all due to opium and drugs. In the early years of the Republic of China, although there were several strict prohibitions, the opium and drug problem continued to spread and the area widened, because the prohibitors were not determined and the smokers did not understand the harm. Those who smoked only opium in the past gradually became more severe, and red pills and morphine gradually became widespread. They can go without food, but they cannot live without opium and drugs; they can not plant rice, but they cannot plant poppies. Those who smoke opium and drugs are directly harmed, and those who do not smoke opium and drugs are also indirectly greatly affected. If this continues, China will inevitably decline even if it is not invaded; even if the powers do not divide it, we will never be able to survive. With such a corrupt and unprogressive nation, if we want to compete on the stage of the 20th century with self-improving and excellent nations, there is no reason to survive. People must insult themselves before others insult them, and the country must attack itself before others attack it. The spread of opium and drugs is equivalent to the suicide of the entire nation. Not only is there no hope of revival, but it will also be forever in an irreversible position. Poland was destroyed, but it can be revived; Turkey was the sick man of the Near East, but it can also be revitalized. However, the reason for their revival and revitalization is that the people are aware of the pain of national destruction, and they can gather, teach, and train, so that they can jump out of the shackles of the powers after the European War. If the majority of the people in the country are addicted to opium and drugs and are confused and lost, even if there is an opportunity, how can they save themselves? Lin Zexu said that after ten years, there will be no available soldiers and no people who can be used. Under the current national situation, without waiting for ten years, the country will be slaughtered by others. Now the powers are preparing their troops and horses to prepare for the arrival of the second world war and re-divide the colonies. Our country has great rivers and mountains, and strong neighbors have been watching for a long time. If we do not seek progress and strive to improve ourselves, the imperialists can take advantage of the pretext of civilization and swallow us up.</p>
<p>China has now reached the last moment of life and death. The revival of the country and nation depends on the results of our final efforts. However, how can the nation be revived? Although there are various conditions, the minimum is to first eradicate the opium and drugs that destroy the country and reduce the population. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has set a three-year plan to ban drugs and a six-year plan to ban opium, and strictly implemented it. This is really the only way to save the country. Because if opium and drugs are not eradicated for a day, the Chinese nation will never have the hope of revival; if opium and drugs are not purified for a day, the Chinese nation will be forever in the dark hell. Opium and drugs are demons that destroy lofty ambitions, opium and drugs are tools that corrupt the spirit, opium and drugs are shackles that bind thoughts, and opium and drugs are sharp weapons that cut the body. Smoking opium and drugs will not only harm oneself, but will also harm future generations. Therefore, for the sake of personal future, for the sake of the development of future generations, and for the sake of the survival of the entire nation, we must strictly eradicate opium and drugs, and we must resolutely quit opium and drugs!</p>
<h3 id="e179">Overview of the Bureau's Anti-Smoking Measures in the Past Six Months <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Cai Jinjun</p>
<p>It is well known that opium is harmful to everyone. Since the late Qing dynasty and throughout the decades of the Republic of China, detailed criminal laws and strict prohibitions have been established. However, in reality, the results have been insignificant, and the harm has become increasingly severe. Why is this? It is simply because the enforcement of the prohibition has not been effective. This city is a major commercial port connecting China and foreign countries, the transportation hub of the nation, with a dense population and a flourishing commerce. Many citizens are accustomed to luxury and indulgence. Lawless individuals take advantage of the convenient transportation and the lack of unified police authority to secretly establish manufacturing or storage dens, transporting and selling opium for personal gain. If we do not urgently plan for a thorough eradication, it will not only harm this area but also affect the implementation of the national anti-smoking policy. Our mayor attaches great importance to the eradication of opium and drugs in this city and is determined to completely eliminate them. I, Jinjun, am in charge of public security and have been ordered to oversee anti-smoking measures concurrently. Although my achievements in the past six months have been insignificant, I feel deeply ashamed. Now, I am writing this article in response to the call for submissions by the preparatory committee for anti-smoking and anti-drug propaganda. I would like to briefly describe the general situation of the Bureau's anti-smoking efforts.</p>
<p>I have always believed that the harm of opium and drugs in our country is so deep that it cannot be eradicated in the short term. Therefore, the late Premier's instructions determined the anti-smoking plan, formulated a six-year anti-smoking program, promulgated orders to eliminate various illegal activities within a time limit, and supervised the provinces and cities to vigorously promote the program. When the Bureau received the order to implement the anti-smoking program in July of the 24th year, we immediately began the first step of registering opium addicts. We believe that prohibiting cultivation, transportation, and sale must be based on prohibiting addiction. The registration of opium addicts aims to obtain the total number of opium addicts and create statistics to serve as a standard for the annual reduction and control of cultivation, transportation, and sale. Therefore, the registration must be universal, and the statistics on opium consumption must be accurate. With accurate statistics on opium addicts and opium consumption, we can set the annual reduction standards. Once the reduction standards are set, we can control the production and sales of opium. As opium addicts gradually decrease, the production, transportation, and sale of opium should also decrease proportionally. When opium addicts are completely abstinent, cultivation, transportation, and sale should be completely prohibited. This approach, which links the prohibition of cultivation, transportation, sale, and addiction, is more effective and well-intentioned than previous enforcement methods and can be confidently anticipated.</p>
<p>Therefore, at the beginning of the Bureau's anti-smoking efforts, the focus of our work was entirely on the registration of opium addicts. From July to December of the 24th year, we registered a total of 30,833 opium addicts. The table is as follows:</p>
<p>According to the table above, the area with the most severe opium and drug problem in this city is the jurisdiction of the Lao Beimen Police Station, followed by the Yi Miao Police Station. The area with the least severe problem is the central urban area. This is a noteworthy point because the areas closer to rural areas have a lighter opium and drug problem, while the densely populated areas have a more severe problem. The social reasons for this phenomenon are worth our study. As for the age statistics of registered opium addicts, the 40 to 50 age group is the largest, followed by the 30 to 40 age group. The 30 to 50 age group is the most important period of life, when people are establishing their careers. Addiction leads to the unseen waste of useful talents. What is the impact on society and the nation? The age statistics of opium addicts are listed below:</p>
<p>Age Number of People</p>
<p>Under 20 years old 17</p>
<p>21 to 30 years old 2248 31 to 40 years old 9468</p>
<p>41 to 50 years old 9437</p>
<p>51 to 60 years old 6628 61 to 70 years old 2698</p>
<p>71 to 80 years old 315 80 to 90 years old 22</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the main purpose of registering opium addicts is to obtain the total number of opium addicts and the total amount of opium consumed. According to the Bureau's statistics on opium consumption, the majority of opium addicts consume one to two qian per day, followed by two to three qian. There are also as many as 26 people who consume more than one liang per day. In total, 30,833 opium addicts were registered, consuming 6373.832 liang of opium paste per day, with an average of more than two qian per person. If each liang of opium paste is calculated at two yuan, then the daily cost is more than 12,747 yuan, and the annual consumption is 4.5 million yuan. This is based on the opium consumption of the first group of registered opium addicts, and the actual number is even higher. What is the impact of this huge amount of money being spent on opium on the national economy and the people's livelihood? This is only in terms of direct consumption. As for the farmland used for opium cultivation, it reduces the production of food crops, leading to the import of foreign food and the outflow of huge amounts of money. The indirect losses cannot be estimated. Therefore, if the harm of opium is not eliminated, the national economy and agricultural production will inevitably suffer, and there will be no way to save the situation. From an economic standpoint, the importance of the anti-smoking problem can be imagined.</p>
<p>The licenses for quitting opium within a time limit are divided into two types: for the poor and for ordinary people. Among those who obtained ordinary licenses from the Bureau, there were 10,387 men and 2,451 women, for a total of 12,838 people. Among those who obtained licenses for the poor, there were 15,364 men and 2,631 women, for a total of 17,995 people. Comparing the two, the number of people with licenses for the poor exceeds the number of people with ordinary licenses by more than 5,000. Logically speaking, opium addiction is something that only those with financial resources can afford. The income of the poor is already insufficient for their daily expenses, so where would they have the extra money for unnecessary consumption? However, in reality, there are more poor people who are addicted to opium than wealthy people. What is the reason for this? This is also worth our study.</p>
<p>According to the population statistics in the Bureau's jurisdiction, there are a total of 2,011,814 people. The ratio of registered opium addicts to the population is 1.5%. This does not include those who have not been registered, those who have quit on their own, and those who have been arrested for opium addiction and sent to rehabilitation centers. According to the estimates of the special industry association in this city, there should be 120,000 opium addicts in this city. Therefore, those who have registered according to the regulations are only one-third of the total number of opium addicts. If we follow the estimates of the special industry association, the ratio of opium addicts to the population in this city is at least 5.4%, meaning that at least five out of every hundred people are opium addicts. Now, the methods for reporting opium addicts for registration have been promulgated. During the reporting period, opium addicts are allowed to register retroactively. In the future, the number of registered opium addicts will increase, and the ratio of opium addicts to the population will change. Therefore, this ratio cannot be determined at this time.</p>
<p>From July to December of last year, the Bureau sent a total of 4,304 opium addicts to various rehabilitation hospitals. Among them, 1,167 men and 284 women were detoxified at the Hu Nan Rehabilitation Hospital, 2,134 men were detoxified at the Hu Bei Rehabilitation Hospital, 253 men and 32 women were detoxified at the temporary detoxification center, and 363 men and 71 women were detoxified at the prisoner rehabilitation hospital. The number of people detoxified at the rehabilitation hospitals designated by the Bureau and the Health Bureau is not included. Analyzing the reasons for the enthusiasm of opium addicts to quit opium, it is due to the fact that some opium addicts have a thorough understanding of the government's anti-smoking policy and have therefore awakened. However, it is also because opium detoxification is completely free in this city, so some people voluntarily report for detoxification. Another group of people are afraid of the severe penalties under the provisional regulations on anti-smoking and punishment, and therefore voluntarily request detoxification. However, from our point of view, it is gratifying if opium addicts have a clear understanding of the government's anti-smoking policy. Even if they request detoxification out of fear of punishment, it is also commendable. Therefore, we believe that the enthusiasm of opium addicts to request detoxification brings endless hope for the future of anti-smoking efforts.</p>
<p>Regarding the investigation of opium cases in the 24th year, the number of cases solved is higher than in previous years due to the Bureau's strict investigation. From January to the end of December of last year, a total of 2,215 cases of private opium use were solved, involving 3,981 first-time male offenders, 490 female offenders, 9 male repeat offenders, and 1 female offender with three offenses, for a total of 3,990 men and 491 women. 652.27 liang of opium were seized. A total of 111 cases of private opium sales were solved, involving 128 male offenders and 24 female offenders. 149.5 liang of opium were seized. A total of 36 cases of private opium transportation were solved, involving 44 male offenders and 4 female offenders. 2,495.36 liang of opium were seized. A total of 166 cases of privately set up opium dens were solved, involving 241 male offenders and 33 female offenders. 91.94 liang of opium were seized. In the above statistical figures, the number of cases of private opium use is the highest, indicating that opium addicts are not fully aware of the anti-smoking laws. This is probably due to the weak foundation of national education. As for the cases of private opium sales, 101 cases were solved before July of last year, and 10 cases were solved after July. From the numerical perspective, it can be seen that the investigation of private opium sales is stricter than before July, making private opium sellers afraid to make a living from this activity. Therefore, the number of private opium sales cases solved has decreased significantly compared to before, which is something we are very pleased about.</p>
<p>The above is a general overview of the Bureau's anti-smoking efforts. Due to space limitations, I cannot list everything in detail. Recently, the Bureau's work has focused on reporting opium addicts for registration. During the reporting period, opium addicts are allowed to register retroactively. This is because the government is compassionate and giving opium addicts an opportunity to reform. However, the deadline is March. We hope that opium addicts who have not yet registered will quickly go to the Bureau to apply for registration and not miss the opportunity, lest they fall into the net of the law. I, Jinjun, am incompetent and have not been able to implement the anti-smoking policy perfectly. I respectfully ask for guidance from members of society so that the advancement of anti-smoking efforts can be more effective and can be completed as scheduled. This would not only be my personal good fortune but also the blessing of the nation and the people.</p>

<h3 id="e180">Has Abyssinia Not Failed? <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Jian Ping</p>
<p>The Italian imperialist war of aggression against Abyssinia, which has lasted for more than half a year, has now resulted in the Italian army winning victory after victory by using various illegal and cruel tactics, due to Abyssinia's isolation and helplessness. According to confirmed war reports, the Italian army has captured the city of Taixi in Abyssinia and is stepping up its advance towards the Abyssinian capital. It can be seen that the Italian-Abyssinian war has reached its final stage. However, at this time when the situation in Europe and the Far East is very awkward, the relationship between imperialist powers is becoming more and more complex. Everyone is very willing to see the Abyssinian war end as soon as possible, and even at the expense of sacrificing the small and weak nations that have been invaded in order to please the Italian Empire. Therefore, the League of Nations, which had once argued red-facedly for sanctions against Italy, has also changed its tune to "the issue of peace talks between Italy and Abyssinia." From this, we can more clearly see the true face of imperialism.</p>
<p>However, the issue of peace talks is not enough to satisfy the ambitious and constantly victorious Italian Empire. Therefore, at the Thirteen-Nation Conference on the 16th, the Italian representative put forward the pre-conditions for the resolution: 1. The Abyssinian army must disarm and show submission. 2. The Abyssinian king must be deposed. 3. The Italian army must occupy the Abyssinian capital. 4. The railway from the French territory of Djibouti to the Abyssinian capital must be specially supervised by the Italian army. In other words, the Italian Empire is unwilling to negotiate peace until Abyssinia is destroyed. Abyssinia, which is bravely resisting the enemy, certainly cannot accept such conditions of national subjugation. The "resolute refusal" of the Abyssinian delegation was expected. The Thirteen-Nation Conference had no choice but to declare the peace talks a failure.</p>
<p>After the failure of the peace talks, the natural course of action is for Italian imperialism to launch a more active and cruel offensive against the Abyssinian capital. Imperialist wars of aggression do not hesitate to use all illegal tactics, and the danger of the Abyssinian capital is inevitable. However, Abyssinia, which is bravely resisting the enemy, will not yield, and their war will not stop because of violence. A dispatch from the Abyssinian capital on the 17th said that the Abyssinian government will move its capital to Biro, 125 miles west of the Abyssinian capital, if necessary. From this, we can see the determination of Abyssinia to resist the enemy. Even if Abyssinia is defeated, we believe that it is glorious and victorious. This is because the success or failure of a thing cannot be concluded based on temporary victories or defeats.</p>

<p>— Bai Ling</p>
<p>—At the Foot of Laoshan Mountain—</p>
<p>In the warm sunshine, that gray Haiqi warship left the Qingdao pier, and on the calm blue sea, it floated along a series of continuous mountains.</p>
<p>The sea in spring is beautiful. The mountains of Qingdao in spring are also beautiful.</p>
<p>After a short voyage, the hazy peak of Laoshan Mountain, which towered high into the clouds, appeared like a large ancient tomb.</p>
<p>Small mountains surrounded it, undulating.</p>
<p>Small boats, each holding only twenty people, lowered from the warship, began to row busily towards the rocky shore.</p>
<p>On the winding, sheep-gut-like, flat mountain road, an uneven team of us, tall and short, wearing light blue uniforms, crawled along, heading straight for the Huayan Temple.</p>
<p>After resting at the Huayan Temple, we dispersed.</p>
<p>At this time, I and three classmates were excitedly hopping around. After visiting the nearby scenic spots, we were really tired, and our feet no longer had the strength to trek. We walked step by step towards a small mountain village. This mountain village had only five households. The small houses were all built of uneven yellow stones, and the roofs were covered with thatch. Around this mountain village was a mountain, and on the left was a vast sea, but there was no farmland. Everywhere was a desolate scene.</p>
<p>We stood behind a house in this mountain village. We couldn't see a single person. Flocks of chickens clucking "cluck, cluck" were scratching around on the hillside. The mountain village was quiet.</p>
<p>Suddenly, from the small road in the south of the village, a man in his thirties walked over. The man's face was long and a bit yellow. He was not wearing a hat, and his head was bald. He was wearing a patched old blue cloth gown, and he looked like someone who didn't work. He walked up to us, glanced at us, didn't stop, and hurriedly walked into a courtyard. We were just about to leave this village when suddenly, a burst of irritable scolding came from the courtyard where the man had just entered: "Damn it, you're so brave!" Followed by a woman's crying. The courtyard became uneasy. A man who was no more than thirty years old ran out of the courtyard, chased by the man we had met. He ran while looking back. But the person chasing him from behind, chased and cursed: "I'll screw your ancestors, if you come again, I'll break your dog legs..." As if he was touched by something, he stopped chasing and immediately turned around and ran into the courtyard. As soon as he entered the courtyard, he raised his voice: "I'm asking you, I'm asking you, do you dare again?" His fist seemed to be punching the woman. The woman pleaded, raising her throat: "I, I, I dare not again..."</p>
<p>The man hit again: "Hey, damn you... what do I keep you for, you're really going to kill me! You're so brave, you're sneaking around with other people when I'm not home... I'm going to beat you, beat you, how much did you get from them? Tell me, tell me?"</p>
<p>The woman sobbed: "I, I, only three times..." After a while: "You have to think about it too, you don't care about me, you're hooking up with other people's women outside, not coming home for three or two months, what am I supposed to eat? Look at other people's men, how capable they are, who's like you... when the spring is warm, everyone goes up the mountain to look for business, haven't you seen how lively the mountains have been these days, the gentlemen, ladies, young masters, and young ladies from Qingdao all come to visit the mountains, you should find a partner, carry a sedan chair up the mountain to take a look... you don't learn to be good, and you come to scold me, beat me, I, I, I was forced to, I had no choice, that's why..."</p>
<p>The man didn't say a word. After a long time, he said: "Damn you, you have no right to interfere with my business, I'm going to beat you, you, you, how much money did he give you? Tell me, tell me, take it out..."</p>

<p>— Xu Ji</p>
<p>The night was dark and deep, and a smoky fog rose at the far end of the street. The wind was blowing incessantly, so sharp and piercing. Fine rain fell quietly like dust…</p>
<p>The street bared its dark and glossy surface, and pedestrians passed by intermittently, one or two at a time. The street was vast and wide. In a corner, the dim light shone on the porch of a house, vaguely revealing a few characters eroded by time: "Xiaoying Tang" (Infant Asylum).</p>
<p>(Infant asylum! There, from a young age, people are constantly suffering a miserable fate, forgetting human love and laughter, and accumulating endless hatred of life...)</p>
<p>Then, from the fine rain, from the distance of the street, a broken black shadow floated: swaying, blurred and weak...</p>
<p>On the night street with fine rain and thick fog, this time, he really mustered up the courage to come here! Before, he had come here alone once or twice to visit, looking at something, thinking about something, deciding something—but this time, really, it was no longer just him alone, but two people! Two people! (He looked at the fragile little life in his arms. Yes, now there were two people!)</p>
<p>His hands trembling, he looked again and again at the little life sleeping in his arms, wrapped in broken bedding, breathing lightly like the evening breeze, carrying a stubborn, cramping will to live: this life had finally come into the world: no one had the right to control its life again, but did people have the right to put it into a miserable fate? That howling, that writhing, that sleeping posture of the baby...</p>
<p>Looking at the dark drawer on the wall of the infant asylum, he trembled violently as if he had been touched by something harmful: there, a person's eternal fate would be buried; there, a soul's eternal laughter would be buried: there, it was a tomb, a terrible blood mouth that devoured people's childhood laughter...</p>
<p>In the cold wind of the night, tears fell sparsely: thinking of the young wife's weeping a few hours earlier, his heart felt like it was being twisted - a wave of sinful regret pierced deeply into his heart, painful, hateful; "Why? Why in the face of life, even the birth of a small life has become the greatest crime? Why should the enthusiasm between people be subjected to such cruel, unforgivable, painful punishments...?"</p>
<p>Destroy it, destroy that miserable little life, and perhaps that will end all the pain of the human world for it; however, thinking of himself, what right did he have to let it die, "Maybe it will grow up; maybe it will change the fate of the world; maybe..."</p>
<p>Thinking that way, his heart gradually became clear and calm. He had been wandering in the fine rain for a while, and the cold wind was blowing his thin clothes, and he was getting wet. He shivered, hugged the little life in his arms tightly again, and gently repented: "Child, you must forgive us in the face of life!" Then, he quickly walked to the corner of the wall, pulled open the big drawer, and quickly put the child in. In an instant, a lonely shadow slipped away on the other side of the street. The street was dark and quiet. The alarm bell of the big drawer rang "Dang", and then the people in the "Baby Receiving Office" inside habitually took the child out: "Ah, another one! We have to register it!"</p>
<p>The registrar registered on the book stroke by stroke, deciding a person's future fate stroke by stroke...</p>
<p>The night was cold and humid, but the tears of the departing person had dried.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Mr. Ziming <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Feng</p>
<p>The spring sunshine warmly shone on Mr. Ziming's gray-white hair, and the two shiny spectacle frames, lonely reflected a weak silver light. Holding a tattered book in his hand, he read with his head shaking. The spectacle frames moved and reflected the light.</p>
<p>His eyes were already blurry. Even wearing reading glasses made it difficult to read. Not only that, his body was bent like a bow. When he stood up, he looked small, his skin was brown, and he looked like a dried-up old man made of wood carvings! However, some of his movements, although clumsy, were sometimes very childish. Sometimes, he would childishly recall and practice the movements of the past, but that would only make himself or others laugh.</p>
<p>He was old. Like the tattered books in his hands…</p>
<p>Those books lonely accompanied him throughout his life. From a very young age, he loved books. He didn't have money to buy books at home, so he borrowed them from others. ——That often resulted in rejection or cold looks. His mother didn't know who she was fooled by, giving her hard-earned money to her child to study, hoping that he would definitely get his money back in the future. Seeing that he had finished reading the Four Books and the Classics, the system was changed at that time; he entered the local higher normal school for free, from which he could become a teacher. A teacher, what a noble profession!</p>
<p>At school, he fell in love with painting. Especially landscape painting in Chinese painting. This doesn't mean that he specialized in painting, he still studied other subjects as usual. Due to his mother's urging and his own efforts, his studies exceeded the level of others, and his landscape painting was even more eye-catching.</p>
<p>So when he graduated, there was no major problem with his job. He chose a position in a middle school and an elementary school in his hometown. He often said that a person should contribute some effort to his hometown, even if that effort is not necessarily great, or even beneficial to his hometown.</p>
<p>At school, the students showed him respect and love. He also guided the students as if he loved his own children.</p>
<p>Especially his paintings, many people came to ask for them; in an era when civil wars broke out one after another, Mr. Ziming's hometown had no way to escape this big vortex. Today, the county magistrate was just changed, and tomorrow, who knew who would be the county magistrate; in that era, his paintings were even more popular: the county magistrates must have him paint them, as a souvenir. We know that when a county magistrate took office, those local gentlemen would all go to curry favor with him, so they came to ask Mr. Ziming to help them, to paint a picture, just any picture, to "commemorate" it. Who knew that after agreeing to it, his fame would grow? This school invited him, that school invited him, and those county magistrates who had retired from office also started schools, and even more fervently invited him.</p>
<p>He was a scholar, with a very strong literati flavor. He tried to find ways to refuse these invitations. He didn't leave his hometown, he was willing to serve the local area.</p>
<p>Later, when the children grew up and the mother got old, he couldn't move even more, so he guarded the home.</p>
<p>He watched himself getting old. One autumn, he suffered another serious illness. After he recovered, his body was as thin as a scarecrow made of a few sorghum stalks, with almost no flesh. At this time, he decided to stop working and recuperate at home, painting a little in the future to exchange for money to live on. But those students who respected and loved him did not allow him to resign, and they waited for him to come to school with their classes empty. This act of kindness made him shed tears, and he went to class supporting his sick body.</p>
<p>In the classroom, he sat on the prepared chair, talked about the book, but couldn't hold on until the end of the class. He wiped the sweat that was flowing down with a handkerchief! Even though it was winter, it flowed very heavily. He announced the end of the class.</p>
<p>Labor after the illness made his illness return to its original state, seemingly even worse.</p>
<p>Now, he was better again. But he was like a person who had lost consciousness, reading books at home every day, and guiding his children with their homework. That child also liked painting like him. He once said that he must work hard like Mr. Ziming in the future. Mr. Ziming only smiled bitterly at the child's words, and said in a dying low voice:</p>
<p>——Don't learn from me, I am useless.</p>
<p>Talking, he put down the tattered book, like he had regained the spirit of his youth, and corrected the child's painting.</p>

<p>Ten thousand sorrows like autumn begonias. My heart is tied to my wistaria lover. Lotus blossoms too lazy to put down golden needles. Only hear, the goldfinches chirping beside my ear. I remember, when we met inside the peony garden. You are, the dodder vine tangled in my breast. My worried heart tight as a narrow lotus hook. I use the cockscomb flower and scheme well. I spent silver flowers and sent a ring. Night-fragrant cereus leads you to my boudoir. I am, a pure-hearted orchid, a flawless jade. I adore you, your appearance like a lotus, surpassing the sixth son. Thus, pitying your talent, I vow to make a lifelong commitment. Smiling, I break into the tower to be with you. You and I, sitting shoulder to shoulder in the bridal chamber like peony and peony. It is, a time of gentle breeze and warm, beautiful spring light. Only see, white cranes flying high beyond the Milky Way. Graceful butterflies in pairs. Fine wine poured into golden goblets. Precious incense ascending in plumes. Straight month rises... person... Together watching... intentions cheerful. Secret peach blossoms bloom on jade cheeks. We pledge our love on the honeysuckle bed.</p>

<p>Opening "Yingying Playing the Qin"</p>
<p>Fragrant lotus, blue water stirs with breeze. Water stirs with breeze, long summer day. Long day, summer. Blue lotus fragrance. Miss Yingying calls Hongniang. Bored sitting in her room, she dislikes the solitude. To relieve her melancholy, she goes to the garden. Flower-lined streets wind around the curves. Silk fan gently raised to shield the sun. On the Nine-Bend Bridge, red railings curve. Green gauze windows by the lake pavilion. Miss is. Leaning on the railing, watching the water. Seeing mandarin ducks playing in the pond. Hongniang pushes open the green gauze window. A fragrant table placed in the center. Incense burning in the censer. The qin taken from its bag. Yingying sits down and tunes it. First plays a Xiangfei Lament. Then plays a Phoenix Seeking its Mate. A Homebound Tune played with increased sadness. Several qin songs finish. The red sun gradually descends the mountain. Little Hongniang. Frantically busy. Puts the qin away. Extinguishes the incense in the censer. Moves the fragrant table aside. Idly approaches the green gauze window. Follows Miss back to her boudoir. Only calling long day, summer breeze stirs water. Cool breeze stirs water, blue lotus fragrance. Truly a summer scene extraordinary.</p>

<p>The Global Harmonica Society at No. 11 Yuancheng Lane, Xinbeimen in this city, to promote harmonica music, in addition to setting up teaching classes, has recently printed 2,000 copies of the harmonica famous song "Star of the Orient" for public distribution. Those who love this music can enclose half a cent for return postage to request it from the society. However, if personal requests are not accepted, various popular sheet music printed by the society's research class are printed on colored paper and are only charged five cents per copy to cover the cost.</p>
<p>Since the Youth Association started the Public Choral Society, it has developed extremely rapidly, and its members have increased to the tune of 500 people. Recently, various social organizations in Shanghai, recognizing that this work can indeed assist the public and obtain legitimate entertainment, have sent letters to the association, requesting that it send leaders to establish Public Choral branches. As a result, the association's leaders are insufficient to meet the demand. The association has now started a Public Choral Leadership Training Class on Tuesday of last week (the 14th). Any social organization that intends to hold a Public Choral Society can send two representatives to the Youth Association on Sichuan Road to request a prospectus and register to join.</p>
<p>Since the Amateur Storytelling Research Society expanded its operations, registration has been extremely enthusiastic. There are no restrictions on gender or age. Regardless of whether they have studied before or not, anyone who is interested in storytelling can join the society. The new articles of association have been printed, and one cent for postage should be sent to the society's preparatory office at No. 16, Lane 487, Aierjin Road, and it will be mailed to you.</p>

<p>— Zhi Er</p>
<p>The Guarantee of Actors (Part 1)</p>
<p>I recently interviewed Miss Xia Peizhen. In addition to discussions on other aspects, she recounted some of the hardships she suffered when filming in the past. For example, when filming "Blood Debt", she said that she was thrown straight down from a mechanism more than ten feet high and fainted from the fall. Also, when filming "Daughter's Sutra", in the frigid winter morning, she was repeatedly blasted by a dozen water spouts, so much so that she couldn't cry or laugh. (She was supposed to be laughing in the play.)</p>
<p>And recently, in the Yihua Company's filming of "Father and Son Heroes", an actor named Wang Zhongkang also fell from a high set more than ten feet high, and could not move. It is said that he will have to stay in the hospital for three months.</p>
<p>When filming, in order to achieve realism, an actor needs to absolutely obey the director. Falling from a high place or being drenched in cold water, one time is not enough, followed by two or three times, or even four or five times, that is to be expected. However, in addition to being serious, after a shot is completed, or before a reshoot, the actor's body should be very carefully protected, which is also necessary. For example, after an actor is drenched in cold water, he should immediately be given a glass of brandy or something else to ward off the cold, so that he does not get sick. Also, for example, when filming a scene of falling from a high place (even if the play does not require a fall, but in order to prevent a misstep), there should also be equipment underneath to prevent falls and injuries, so as to avoid accidental damage to the actor. In addition to these necessary equipment, there should be a regular medical advisor to examine the actor's body, which is not an excessive request. This is not only a matter of "locking the fold after the sheep is stolen," but also a matter of "preventing problems before they happen." As for all the necessary medical expenses, they should naturally be borne by the company authorities, which is of course a matter of great justice.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Warner Bros.' Amazing Contribution "Human Hell" to be Publicly Performed Soon <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>The film industry giant Warner Bros. Pictures is famous for its tense, terrifying and stimulating productions. Since the giant film "Desperate" was released, it has become a sensation and won enthusiastic praise from all walks of life, breaking all box office records, and is the company's most honorable masterpiece. Warner Bros., in view of the need for such films, produced this "Desperate", even more exciting and tenser "Human Hell". The film stars the big star Donald Huazhi and the actress Katherine Knack, as well as the entire cast of the famous film "Iron-Blooded General", directed by the famous director Luo Yiqi and Jin. The entire film depicts a promising young man who, because he does not follow the instructions of politicians, is tricked into prison with his friend and suffers all kinds of hardships, whipping and torture. His friend could not bear it and wanted to escape, but was electrocuted by the electric fence. It was extremely tragic. Later, he angered the prison guards and was punished to work in a dark mine, which was even more painful. Later, he contacted various criminal miners, rebelled against the prison, and fought a major battle with the police. Finally, the young man gained his freedom and married his girlfriend. This film has a very touching depiction of the inhuman lives of criminals, and the cruel prison guards, etc., who grit their teeth and wish they could swallow them in one bite. In short, it is an extraordinary production. It is said that it will be publicly performed in the most noble theater in this city soon.</p>
