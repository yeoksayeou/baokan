<h3>區域公約與遠東安全問題</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>自國際聯盟大會開幕。中國有被選為行政院半常任理事之可能。國人對於日內瓦之和平組織。重感興趣。以國際和平勢力緩和遠東危機之希冀。又一度增高。往者國聯行政院以無遠東國家之代表。於亞洲之事。態度冷淡。今大會關心中國之要求。使亞洲最主要國家得常厠身與英蘇意法等歐洲大國間。共商世界各項問題。於遠東安全當不無裨益。雖然。中國被選入行政院之際。正國聯威望日薄虞淵之時。以區域公約代替集體安全之說。甚囂塵上。此後國聯之活動。將有裨於東亞和平考。果達何種程度耶。</p>
<p>夫集體安全與區域公約。性質有異。在集體安全原則之下。一國侵略。卽為世界之公敵。凡國聯會員國均負同等的制裁之義務。良如盟的所言。戰爭或戰爭之威脅。乃有關於全體之休戚者也。區域安全制。乃在一定之區域內。諸國共同負維持安全制裁侵略之責。而區域以外各國。則不過問。羅卡諾公約。卽區域安全公約之明例。其範圍僅及於萊因河附近之英法此意德五國。而受保障者僅限於德法比接壤之境界。使盟的修改。以羅卡諾之方式代替盟約之第十章至第十七章之規定。則歐洲為區域安全之一單位。東亞亦成為區域安全之一單位。在今日情形之下。國聯之主動力。在於英法。英法所關心之地帶。在於萊茵河區域。遠束之事。無暇過問。亦無力處理。縱使今後國聯能為和平努力。緩急先後。必有區別也。</p>
<p>况以國聯為倡導組織遠東之區域安全制度。尙有絕大阻碾。蓋遠東問題。以日蘇英美及中國為主體。中國以國力過弱。往往處被動地位。四强之中。日美兩國均非國聯之會員國。與羅卡諾五國中僅德國置身於國聯以外考。頗有不同。昔華府舉行會議。英美日法四國曾簽訂四國公約。共約保持太平洋之現狀。尊重彼此領士屬地之安全。設有侵略。則羣議應付之方。此項規定。與區城安全協定性質相同。然華盛頓條約中雖有恊商諮詢之規定。而九一八以後。此項條文並未實施。在今日情形之下。欲日本簽同性質之條約。恐非可能。欲美國加入國聯所發起之遠東區域安全公約。負更大之制裁義務。亦多困難。保障希望甚為渺茫。</p>
<p>國聯不能解决歐洲之問蹬。而英法等國又急急於求西歐局部之和平。欲遠東安全之得保障。吾人對於國聯。不必抱過分之希冀也。</p>

<h3>歐游通信　康脫凡悌號到香港</h3>
<p>— 徐訏</p>
<p>從上海到威尼斯是三萬里的路程，以意大利的執世界權威的郵船SS　Conte　VERDE來航行，也要二十五天的工夫，可是所有廣吿都以念三天到歐洲來宣傳的，念三天到歐洲原是不錯，可是我們初行的人，終只想到威尼斯的目的地，所以沒有一個不誤會二十三天就可以到威尼斯的，船是八月二十八日四點鐘啟椗，不知道是不是有這廣吿上日期的經濟，而要把啟行的時間定得這樣早；送客的人，兩三點鐘時候才回去，乘客一覺醒來，船已經在海中了。</p>
<p>這次同船到歐洲去留學的學生不算少，大槪去英的有二十一位，赴德的有十八位，赴法赴比的各四位，赴意的有三四位，加上到意國公使館去任職的夫婦，則有五六之多，此外到奧國的有一位，到瑞士也有一二位，這許多中國孩子，無論其在社會上做過許多年事情，或在中國閱歷過許多人生，或剛剛從大學出來，無論官費或者自費，大家總算都是中產以上的子弟；他們身上也都有一技之長，在中國社會中很可以有一個職業，而且大家也都有一個家庭；為什麽要遠涉重洋到迢迢的國外去呢？這無論他們是為智識，或是為名，或是為利，總之都是為前途的光明，而對於目前的現狀不滿足之故吧。</p>
<p>差不多的的學生都搭經濟二等艙，可是下面通艙里還有客人，客人中除印度人外就是中國人，那些中國人，都是些小商人或者手藝工人，雖然不見得都到意大利上船，但離開自己的故鄉到遙遠遙遠的異地是一樣的，而其所受碼頭上船上以及異地種種的壓迫與苦處，是遠超過那羣留學生以上的，我於前天會卜去訪問，他們同一樣地方與鋪位，從上海到新加坡，有的是七十五元有的是三十五元，其相差有如此之大的；不知道的人會不相信，不過坐過北洋南洋長江等船的朋友，都可以曉得同樣到天津或那里的房艙，那不過一二十元的價目，就可以有十來元的上下，那末看這里船價的高低，也就沒有什麽可希奇，中國有無數無數靠碼頭上吃敲竹槓飯的流氓，巳有無數無數在農村里靠田地上吃敲竹槓飯的流氓，還有無數無數在敎育在政治方面……總之，中國所有的流氓都能規規矩矩靠勞力去吃飯，中國的漢奸就沒有賣國賊也會消跡的，凡是不淸明的政治都有不淸明的人羣做背景，是互相利用，函數式的只好讓一方都存在着的。然而那羣小商人與手藝工人還是忍受這些千欺萬凌的到外面去，這倒底是為什麽？還不是有求光明的前途，因不滿於現狀而求前進的。</p>
<p>這可見中國人不是不會不滿意現狀，不是不會求前進，而都只有個人的改良，而沒有集團的反抗。所謂個體的改良是生物界就有的現象，生物界中也常有因不適合環境而改變自身的生理組織的；而集團的反抗則是將環境改變了以適合自已的生存，這則只有人類社會方才有的。</p>
<p>我並不是說求個體的改良就是一種動物的行為，個體的改良在人類中也是常有的，把孩子培養大也能說個體的改良，給他敎育也是個體的改良，但個體改良的目的在生物是為適合環境，在人類則剛剛相反，是為改良環境的。這才是人類勝於生物的地方。可是中國回國的留學生不少了，大多數給我們知道的，都只是把自己的個體適合於環境，在環境之中作個人的爭奪吧了。以醫生來論，都市里有成千成萬的醫生，都是有本事的留學生，可是都在都市里傾軋爭生意，很少有一二個人連絡着在小鎭小市的地方改成一個有科學化醫院的環境的！以敎育來論，許多許多有本事的留學生，回來以後，也只是在都市中爭地位，把持與傾軋，有誰肯到小城小鎮去辦敎育，去改良敎育環境呢？所以由這些地方看來，大多數中國人改良了個體，只能適應環境，而不能改良環境的。</p>
<p>在外國讀書的中國人，程度好的很多，學問好的很多，他們千辛萬苦的到外國去，目的就在求學，就在改良個體，所以常常比別國人用功，而功課也能在別人以上的，所以以求個體改良而論，中國人是並不弱的，那麽為什麽到中國後只能適應環境，而不能改良環境呢？</p>
<p>這就因為沒有集團的組織與習慣，改良環境必需有這種組織與習慣。一個醫生到小鎭辦醫院或者不可能，那必需集合幾個醫生去方才可以勝任。這種習慣的養成，就在於改良個體時候的注意與聯絡的。為什麼你學醫要到外國去？你一定會吿訴我外國設備好，材料好，組　完備，所以在你改良個體的時候，你必需注意改良你個體的環境。</p>
<p>我在大學曾聽一個周姓敎授的課，這敎授是擔任高級心理實騐的，但是他自己對於心理實騐的機械不但不會裝置而且不了解，於是許多機械都只是列而不用，我想他或者不至泠有見過這些機械，不過學在學的時候，只是在別人的已裝好的架子做一遍實騐，對於實騐的環境當然毫不曉得的。可這樣的人本沒有敎課的資格，但不注意環境一點正是中國人易犯的毛病。</p>
<p>所以這是兩方面的，個體改良與集團組織新接觸，環境的了解與舊環境的改造。在道一羣旅伴之中，我希望他們都有這樣的覺到。</p>

<p>高氏於席次起立報吿云、今天乘着吳市長招待各位的機會、並承中央宣傳部方部長之召、來把籌辦所得稅的經過、作一個簡要的報吿、在淸末的時候、就有辦所得稅的動機、因政局之不定、沒有成功、民國改建、民元·民三·民四·民九·民十·北京政府、迭决籌議開辦、也是一紙空文、未見實行、終歸曇花一現而已、民十六北伐成功以後、國民政府凖備好幾决、因為事實上的困雜、仍然有始無終、一直到去年七月、才由財政部孔部長遵照中國國民黨的政策政綱、起草法案、呈經行政院决議、送立法院審査、這才算是正式開始了、所得稅的原則、是今年六月二十四日十六次中央政治委員會議通過的、所得稅的暫行條例、是七月九日立法院會議通過的、七月二十一日、由國民政府公布、八月十八日、行政院第二七五次例會通過所得稅暫行條例施行細則、八月二十二日、院會公布此項細則、關於所得稅經過的立法程序大槪如此、至於所得稅暫行條例的內容、是以公平·簡便·為原則、並且顧到人民納稅的能力、和社會經濟的條件、所以現訂的稅率極輕微、所用方法極單簡、根據公布的暫行條例課稅的範圍、分三類、第一類、是營利事業所得、以除去開支後的純益額計算課稅、凡公司·商號。行棧·工廠·或個人資本在二千元以上營利所得纔課稅、不滿二千元之資本不收、官商合辦營利事業、以及一時營利事業之所得、都按所得之多少而課稅、以期公允、幷且營業所得的純益、不滿五厘、或一時所得不及百元者、仍予免稅、第二類、是薪級報酬所得、依公務員·自由職業者·及其他從事各業者薪給報酬所得課稅、每月平均得不到三十元的也不課稅、幷且小學敎員的薪給、和軍士·官佐·公務員因公傷亡之卹金·殘廢·勞工·以及無力生活者之撫卹金·養老金·贍養費·等、一律免予納稅、第三類、是證券存欵所得、凡公債·公司債·股票·及存欵利息之所得、以每决或結算付給之利息計算課稅、稅率不過千分之五十、而公務員勞工之法定儲金、敎育慈善機關、或團體之基金存欵、以及敎育儲金、每年所得利息不及百元者、也一律免稅、按照上項分類課稅辦法、第一類、營利事業所得的純益、達到五厘以至一分、或者所得在百元以上以至于元以下、僅就所得之純益征收千分之卅、第二類的稅率、薪給報酬、每月平均到了三十元、征稅五分、較之各國、總是再輕沒有的、征收的手續、分兩種、　　一是用扣繳的辦法、如公務員之薪給、可由發薪機關照扣、債券存欵的利息、可由付息的銀行、或儲蓄會等照扣、二是用申報的辦法、先由納稅人自己報告、再由政府加以抽査審核、這是課稅分類和稅率的大槪情形、至于本人奉命和各同仁籌備所得稅的進行、雖沒有顯鉅的成績、以慰各方的期望、但是承各方熱烈的維護、總算是很順利的、沒有遇着困難、特別的要感謝新聞界為國宣傳的贊助、不過敝處負着這個責任、抱定宗旨、遵照孔部長所說的「辦新稅决以新人才新精神赴之、」的意思、所需要的職員、一律考試取才、第一期、巳經招考了七十名大學畢業生、現在正在嚴格的加以訓練、然後才派出來服務、同時確立會計制度、將來經征與收欵分立負責、彼此監督、任何人不能取巧弄弊、征收的費用、力求節省、辦事的手續、力求簡單、對于納稅人無論如何、是决定寗漏不擾的辦法、使他們自然而然的就範、我們要做到不濫不費不慌不擾地步、以獲得全國人的同情、就是外僑也是同等的待遇、决無歧異、現在行政院第二七五次例會决議、從本年十月一日起、開征公務員之薪給報酬所得、和債券存欵利息·兩種、其餘明年一月起再行課稅、我們負責者，惟有遵辦而已、現在財政部已在部內設立所得稅事務處、主管征收事務、各省市亦已派有專門委員、分期與地方當局接洽、幷辦理關子所得稅推行事宜、將來中央與各省市之征收機關、卽本此合理之組織、視稅務之進展需要、及人才之訓練養成、逐步使其擴充健全、目前開征者、均係用扣繳法之所得、故尙無擴大組織之必要、這是籌備的大槪情形、最後要附帶說明的、就是所得稅的理論、各位當然很明瞭、母庸贅述、不過这次來辦所得稅、有兩個很重要的意義、一是革新稅制、我國的租稅、歷年來都是偏重於間接稅、而間接稅不合於租稅的普遍·公平·富有彈性·的三個原則、世界各國、已經辦了所得稅的、有五十多國、無一不是以所得稅為其國家租稅收入的主要基幹、絕對不是純靠間接稅為來源的、也絕對沒有不辦所得稅而可以致富强之域的、國家的財政沒有上軌道、政治沒有上軌道、才沒有所得稅、請問各位、誰可以武斷、我國不可以向有軌道的路上去走、况且間接稅的基礎、旣不穩固、一國的財源、當然不能恃為租稅的基幹、假定國家的情勢有變遷、或者經濟的狀態發生動搖、那麽間接稅也就隨之受感應、而不能維持原有數額的收入、　　這樣的情形、很足以影響國家財政的安定、甚至可以動搖國本、危如纍卵的我國、懲前毖後、非革新稅制、另闢一個完善的途徑、建立國家財政的健全基礎、不足以救亡圖存、這是第一個說法、第二就是要平均負担、我們看全國的人口、農民居百分之八十、勞工也不在少數、這大羣農工的負担怎麼樣、他們每年的收入非常的少、每年直接間接的担負、却比任何人重、這樣不平的情形、任何人都知道的、可以說他們痛苦不堪、而無法解救、近幾年、政府看到這點、中央與地方皆努力的幹那裁廢苛捐雜稅的工作、很想換一個局面、使無力納稅農工的負担、轉一部分給有力納稅的人、尤其非辦所得稅不能貫澈這個計劃、要是這樣幹、才能够維持民生平衡的協調、才能把負担的義務來平均、平均負担的目的、最注重的民生問題、同時也是為顧慮國家治安而策動、是消弭隱患唯一的方法、二十多年來、新聞界無時無刻不有救濟民生的理論、民生痛苦的新聞、使政府日自警惕、更無時無刻不在報紙上大聲疾呼的主張、督促政府的改革、蘇息民困、現在可以說、這决辦所得稅、就是實現新聞界的主張、完成新聞界的目的、至於目前的暫行條例和辦法、完善二字、誰也不敢武斷、因為在我國尙屬初創、必須依照經騐和事實來求改良進步、談到推行的責任、政府方面、絕對不能放棄責任、新聞界方面、允望多多的協助和匡導、要通力合作、庶乎可以達到歷年官民一致的希望完了、</p>

<p>擁擠大堪</p>
<p>碩大之刑三庭、幾無立足之地、而被摒於庭外者、尙不在少數、先由捕房律師張師竹起稱、本案捕房、現依照刑法二七一條第一欵殺人罪及二四七條遺棄尸體罪起訴、自上决庭諭改期之後、茅阿根在捕房已經供認不諱、據稱、於事前已共同商妥、乃於九號在新閘救火會會齋、一同出發、而裝屍之籐箱、係由蔣元菼於八號交茅阿根洋六元、茅卽往愛多亞路二百九十二號三友箱店以二元八角之代價購得該籐箱、蔣元英則將自己之斧頭一柄携帶、茅因係開車、</p>
<p>並無斧頭</p>

<p>彩英之名</p>
<p>然實另有其人、而死者並不每大至該塲服務、故非正式女茶房、是以並無照片、而存福里之看弄人葉奎玉、則稱三號係空屋、此係避免責任之言、又據二百十一號救火員曾對人言、曾聞三百八十九號救火員談及、於八月九日之後、見蔣元英洗過血衣、但向三八九號査詢、則加以否認、而林根弟與茅阿根姘識之前、與五六一號姘識·曾開過房間四次、今日中華旅社之　役、亦已到庭、應請庭上質訊云、庭上卽</p>

<p>日期、確為八號、與茅共先後開過房間三次、出事後、茅曾允將死者衣服送我幾件、我不要、彼允代我製一新衣、然迄今未送我、當時茅等將被頭揩盡血跡後、卽將死者之衣服十餘件打一包裹携去、此决因死者附身、囑代報仇、乃在路上向人道出此事、實非有意誣陷茅·蔣·二人云云、而茅阿根仍堅决否認、並稱箱子實非我購、而由包探領至各箱店査取同樣之箱、而西人頭目之斧、我始終未曾加過云云、詰之蔣元英、忽將上次庭訊時所供認之詞、完全推翻、謂實因被根弟一口咬件、更以</p>
<p>刑罰難受</p>
<p>祇得胡認根弟之所以誣我、實因某日根弟在新新公司與遊客爭鬥、為我趕出所致、茅之律師范　卽提出報紙一張、謂工部局醫生葛福亭曾發表尸首之殺、係於　十四小時之內、故本案應再將尸體送交法醫檢　云云、種排事以本　捕房所査獲之斧柄、及出事處所獲之關色粉等、均有化騐之必要、遂諭本案改期十月一日下午再訊所獲各物、候送法醫硏究所鑑定再核、</p>

<h3>滬西民敎實驗區　訓練模範車夫　灌輸普通學識　糾正行為錯誤</h3>
<p>滬西民生敎育實騐區、鑒於人力車夫大都沒有受過相當敎育、故有時有蠻橫情事發生、該區茲為剷除各種不良觀念起見、特於昨日假座中山路總輔導處、舉行首决訓練模範車夫、情况熱烈、茲彙誌各情如决、</p>

<p>夫婦智識</p>
<p>— 美國本薛文尼大學醫學博士姚爾昌著</p>
<h3>兩性間不姙的是非公論</h3>
<p>……以醫學的頭腦判明其所負的責任　……用科學的方法指示一條成功之路</p>
<p>一對夫婦在結婚三年之後，假若沒有產生子女，那末一定會引起夫婦間的煩惱，家庭間的裂痕也就不免在開始醖釀了。不過照醫學的理論來講，除了有不姙的病症阻撓之外，天下決沒有不姙的女子和不育的男子。但是真的患了不姙症之後，應該來判明誰的過失，切不可將過失一味諉之於妻，這是大大的錯誤。</p>
<p>職是之故，那已進入結婚生活的青年，經過了二年乃至三年，而仍未獲姙的夫婦，應即首先就診於有信用的專門醫士，而求確認其原因，如果責任屬於男子或在女方，那一方面應該講求其對策。</p>
<p>男子方面的不姙原因，極簡單地說起來是：（一）陰莖底畸形；（二）睾丸底發育不全、但這些病症，還都限於少數、而最多者厥為淋病、以致失却了生殖之能力。就中，萬其是像淋毒性疾患那樣的病，大都是男子把這種病毒傳染給了女子，妻子却因此血引起子宮，喇叭管或者卵巢的病症，而幾幾乎終于畢生不姙者，</p>
<p>此外，最普遍而習見的男子的不姙，則為陰萎與早洩，此純為內分泌缺乏·生殖腺衰頹之故。但是女子之不姙底原因，並不全都是由男子方面而來的。並不是那麼一概地全是因花柳病而妨碍了生殖底機能。因了其他各種各樣的原因，都可以形成不姙症。即主要的是：子宮底發育不全，卵巢底發育不全，月經不調等。所以，所謂不姙症者，乃是因為身體有了病症的緣故，如崇尙迷信而求孕、那全是無益的勾當美國克利弗呢亞大學生理學院院長霍爾謨斯教授Prof，Samud。l。JHolmes’曾經在紐約優生學會第二次國際代表大會，發表了一篇世界馳名的生育講演，對於男子的早洩，陰萎很忠實地指示一種生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』補救法，他闡明生殖腺素結於不姙的男子獲益非淺，不但可使男子精力充足，性神經衰弱症消失。如婦女患有月經不調，子宮及卵巢底發育不全等症，可以女用『生殖素』服之，他對於『生殖素』之發明者之奧國生理學家斯丹那博士，尤推崇備至，彼曾向全球學術界作廣播演講，認為國淋病而喪失生育的男女，非服德國傑特生博士發明的黃色素和伐克辛合製劑『安敵淋』不可。我曾在美國以『生殖素』治愈一婚後之陰萎表年，及以『安敵淋』治愈一有慢性淋病的俄國商人，後此兩人均獲得子，此誠為絕嗣者的有力實證。</p>
<h3>世界最美的女郎訪問記</h3>
<p>— 訪問者小巴黎晨報記者Barees周笑涵醫師節錄</p>
<p>她說乳峯是女子健美所必需的生命缐也就是女子一生健康的基礎不容忽視高高的乳峯，是二十世紀女性最美的集中點。時代的小姐們，無論妳的容貌怎樣美麗，衣服怎樣漂亮，妳切不可漢視妳的乳峯發育，這是妳分頭的要素，也是潮流的趨向。具有標準美的德國Kellemann女士是全世界最健美而最適合美的標準的女性了。女士的記數是乳峯高度為三英寸半，胸廓35．2吋臀圍278吋大腿之周圍為22．2吋，法國小巴黎晨報記者A．D．Barees．氏，曾在她的寓所作公開的訪問，關於訪問所得，刋載於The　Women　News．據云：「此具有健美權威的Kellemann女士，為一容貌美麗，乳峯高聳的女子，今年　二十一歲，她的乳峯結實而柔靸，和她豐腴的臀部，恰巧構成極自然的曲線，她曾研究醫學，一九三二年赴奧專攻美容術，她完全根據醫學的原理以收事半功倍之效，彼之成功，實深得奧國著名生理學家斯丹那氏的學理，完全藉生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」之功。兩年前彼的乳峯並不高聳，乃以「生殖素」服之，其後精神特別旺盛，全身發育，突飛猛晉，乳與臀部健美異常云。」</p>
<p>是時代的中國女性，妳假若要覔得健美的秘決，在交際場中不為異性所輕悅，妳能毫不心怯嗎？也許有人輕輕地說；「臉子到好派司，乳太萎瘪真難看死了。』你將怎麼辦呢？那你實在不可忽視上面的一段記載。這是妳的金科玉律。</p>
<h3>無痛苦的戒煙法</h3>
<p>— 賈治中醫師</p>
<p>大凡吸烟的人，都有一種茍安的僥倖性，假使要他戒煙，更視若畏途了，考其原因，實在是戒煙時的痛苦，使人難受，因為在戒煙期中，身體必定衰弱，疾病更容易侵入，像失眠，盜汗，腰　背痛，精神不支等症，更使戒者增加痛苦，而又無力抵抗，所以怕於戒煙了，但在戒煙期中若能用培補戒煙法，投以生殖腺製劑「生殖素」並注射育維賜保命，使體力增強，不難在短期中無痛苦而又不覺中完全戒除煙毒，試述一例於後？</p>
<p>去年有吸者鄭鴻銘，年四旬餘，吸煙已達十餘年，以前身處政界，吸食自如，癮念甚深，近以戒煙期限很嚴，無奈體力不支，欲戒不能，這當然是他怕痛苦，後余以培補戒煙法施行內服「生殖素」及注射育維賜保命，戒期三個月，癮念俱無，見煙自惡，在無痛苦中安全戒絕矣。</p>
<p>以健美著稱全世界的德國Kellemann女士，大受新聞記者所包圍，風頭不減於政治家，果何為乎至於斯焉？</p>

<h3>手淫青年的自新之路</h3>
<p>— 節錄The　Evolutlon　of　Sex原文。賈治中醫師</p>
<p>……受手淫之害的各種病態曲曲寫出　……發育不全遺精性神經衰弱等療法</p>
<p>當世最著名的兩位生物學大家，蓋德斯先生（Pauick　Geddes）和湯潑蓀爵士。（Sir　Arthur　Thompoon），在他們合著的一部科學傑作，名呌『性的演進』（The　Evolution　of　Sex）裏面，曾經關於男女青年手淫的弊害，發表了一篇詳明切實的理論，他，不姙症的發生。然此各種病態的將期爆發時確定男女青年的嗜好手淫，完全屬於病態，按人體的得以繁殖健康，須需身體各部產生新的細胞，以替代留存體內所有的舊細胞，使四肢百骸皮膚毛髪，新陳代謝循環不息，方始不妨碍康健而減少疾病機會的來臨。然促成此細胞的交替作用者，尤非精液充足不為功。手淫行為的青年，非但不能使精液充足，而且更進一步來浪費精液，因為它完全是自動色淫，摧殘腦力和精　更勝尋常性交十倍，能阻碍性器的發育；所以很有人因此生殖器特別細小。能使全身營養衰退；因此很普遍地有人面色蒼白，精神不振，食欲銳減，胃臟障碍等症。能使神經衰弱；因此難逃耳鳴，頭痛，心悸，失眠，健忘等症。能使性能受損，因此有早洩，陰萎，不姙症的發生。然此各種病態的將期爆發時，必有前驅的症關發現，發現此前驅症狀者，厥為遺精，故手淫之與遺精，成為不可分離的連縏，故能止其遺精，實為避免其各種病態的扼要方策。因此他建議，罹有手凈癖者，只消設法來堅定神志；鞏固精　。神志堅定，夢幻自少，外界的引誘，不受衝動；精　鞏固，精液欲實現上述兩種療法，應推德國性病學家希米脫氏Schmidts發明的「希米脫氏固精片」為吾人最理想的成功者。我們在他的成功上，可以揣測科學的進步已不難接近最高之水凖了。</p>
<p>（編者按：遺精的療法，難有此特效劑的發明，但因遺精過久之後而所起的神經衰弱症及早洩，陰萎，應以『生殖素』服之，此為吾醫界公認之最有實效之療法）</p>
<p>性病講座</p>
<p>— 姚爾昌博士詹念曾醫師合編</p>
<p>（診所）四川路北京路轉角中國信託公司二樓　（門診）上午十時至下午六時。星期日休息。</p>
<p>性病症關，各類殊多。其為吾人所習見之者，如生殖器之細小，性生活的不能，如早洩，陰萎等是也。他若房事過度，肌肉削瘦，精液枯竭，必至影響於全身的康健，不但易以衰老，且多無健康活潑之子嗣產生，甚或竟至不孕。</p>
<p>青年之嗜手淫，實為促成上述各種性病的堦梯，尤以遺精，滑精及發育不能為最。此外之早婚及多妻者，其弊害實與手淫惡癖相等。據調查所得，都市的市民較居於鄉村者體質較弱，主要原因，為性病的猖獗，及花柳傳染病的橫行，此幾為人盡所知的事實也。並有二例，足資證實。</p>
<p>（一）手淫耽溺阻碍發育</p>
<p>患者馮世益，年二十歲。十七歲時即有手淫惡癖，故全身發育障碍，生殖器細小且有包莖。（主訴）——陰莖如童子，至十九歲時，自知有損康健，乃戒絕手淫，但遺精難止，一星期至少四次。故本人神經異常衰弱，失眠，健忘，耳鳴，心悸等症，接踵相繼。（現在症狀）——全身營養不佳，面色蒼白，肌肉瘦削，生殖器發育不全，包莖異常，神經衰弱症極度惡化，最劇烈者，厥為遺精。（治療方法）——用平面電療，斷護腺按摩，由詹醫師割去包皮，以『希米脫氏固精片』止其遺精，同時服以『生殖素』消滅其神經衰弱症，並助長發育，不到兩月，發育良佳，遺精及神經衰弱症盡除。</p>
<p>（二）早婚絕嗣陰萎早洩</p>
<p>患者，鄧達貴，年甘一歲，十七歲即已結婚，（主治）——因結婚過早，罹有早洩，陰萎症等，故結婚四年，尙未生育，現除早洩，陰萎之外，並罹有腦弱，耳鳴，頭痛，失眠等症。（治療方法）——除每日服以『生殖素』四次之外，並為之注射『育維賜保命』，節制其房事，如是兩月，性能轉強，陰萎，早洩完全治好，鄧君鹽於『生殖素』之效騐，因身體虛弱，現作為常年補劑，故彼之夫人業已懷孕四月矣。</p>
<p>胃痛自療</p>
<p>編者先生：我在四五年前，突患劇烈的胃痛，每在晨起飯後，作　吐酸，疼如絞割，求醫服藥，絕無效騐，請賜我良方，以脫苦海，不勝盼感（王念誠）（答）可向中西藥房購『胃痛靈』內服，疼痛立止，並服『健胃素』增強食慾，輔助消化，自能自愈。</p>
<p>白帶根治</p>
<p>編者先生：我不幸患着不可告人的隱疾——白帶，起初祇流少許，後來越來越多，因此精神遭受莫大的損傷，頭暈失眠，體健日減，惶急異常，後幸在三月前逅邂幼時同窗李女士，囑我到五洲藥房購『療帶靈』外用，『女用生殖素』內服，現已帶凈根治，誠靈藥也。</p>
<p>未老先衰</p>
<p>編者先生：幼時我最玩皮，喜自弄生殖器，非到洩精得樂不止，所以旦旦而伐，　喪　度，現在形削骨立，面黃血枯，髪白背灣，蒼老得如同老人，請賜治療之法，（鄧自新）</p>
<p>（答）速至五洲藥房購服「生殖素」，再就詹念曾醫師施行電療。</p>
<p>發育不全</p>
<p>編者先生：我是一個二十五歲的青年，照年齡我應是一個偉丈夫了，誰知我的身體，矮小得如同孩子，尤其是生殖器形如白菓，渺小得可憐，失却了人生應有樂趣，請賜治法（施大）（答）「生殖素」為治發育不全之唯一特效藥，各藥房皆有出售。</p>
<p>自療常識</p>
<h3>淋病療法的商權</h3>
<p>— 香港醫科大學醫學學士吳大超</p>
<p>關於淋病的療法，在各醫學書籍及各國醫界曾討論不已；而國外的著名學者，也都孜孜不倦，憚心竭力，冀將研究所得使淋病的治療方法，得一更新之途，所有以前的困難問題，掃除盡絕。的確，科學家的埋頭苦幹，使患者獲益非淺，當余在港大花柳病院研究時，曾得世界著名的英國淋病專家Ladison氏蒞院演講云：「渠最欽佩德國醫學發明的成功，為世界任何民族所不及，尤以淋病藥的研究，可以壓倒全世界，如傑特生博士之發明黃色素和伐克辛合製劑「安敵淋」其所含之成分，確為他藥所不及？不但能透膜殺菌，且使服者全身血液中，產生無數抗毒菌苗，直迫淋病雙球菌無由生存云云。」余固早知黃色素和伐克辛對於治淋上之功效，但自得專家之闡明後，余益信賴。故近年來對於患者之療法，無不以「安敵淋」為我主要用藥之標準。證於臨床之經騐所得，鮮有失敗。上年冬有一患者曾罹慢性白濁，且睾丸腫脹，遍服各藥，均少效果，後山余以「安敵淋」服之，如湯潑雪，即見奇效，不但睾丸腫脹消退，且淋濁立止，前後不到五星期，完全治好。</p>
<p>骨痛常識</p>
<h3>患骨痛病的救星</h3>
<p>— 兪伯符醫師</p>
<p>『強斯登氏骨痛片』的偉績</p>
<p>骨痛病一症，本來沒有特效的藥可以治療，尤其是處在這世內日澆，人慾橫流的現代，本症更現着嚴重的問題，年老的人，患這種病的，因由於其一生操勞過度，或營養不良，不重衛生，因之瘋濕內侵，促成本症，但現在恒見一輩有為的壯年人，也時嚷着骨節　痛，四肢麻木，這是什麼緣故呢？這大概都是因為少年時手淫過度或房勞損喪；或花柳病毒，致尿份不潔，而身體隨着衰弱，失却了抵抗力，日積月累，瘋濕內蘊，餘毒內攻，本症即可在無意中促成，患着了這病，他的痛苦，就不啻終身墮入了地獄。</p>
<p>美國強斯登氏博士，有鍳及此，畢一生的研究，發明了『強斯登氏骨痛片』一藥，確係對症良藥，無論新久骨痛，莫不服之立愈，且可永不復發，</p>
<p>患者施再春，年川三歲，幼時沉淪手淫，婚後又恣意房事，尋花問柳，因之血份不潔，瘋濕內蘊，即患劇烈之骨痛，每屆節氣過勞，四肢百骸，節節酸痛，服藥無效，諸醫束手，及後購服『強斯登氏骨痛片』四瓶，　痛乃止，且週身輕鬆，如釋重負云，</p>

<h3>我國足球隊　在英兩戰詳情　輿論界一致推許　英國人大為驚奇　憑列山自倫敦寄</h3>
<p>倫敦航空特訊</p>
<p>中國足球隊、此决參加世界運動會、第一賽就遇到英國隊、許多人都覺得咱們的運氣不好、於國際運動競賽中、往往一出馬立刻碰着强敵、假如我們不斤去計較一時的勝負、那末就容易明白這一次中英足球賽的意義、經過了這一度比賽以後、才奠定卜中國足球隊在國際間的地位、中國足球隊的努力、雖說楚戰收了、還是我們在此决世界運動會中唯一的收獲、唯一的成就、</p>
<p>說到足球、這是英國人的國家運動、英國足球隊、素來在國際間是佔領袖的地位的、當中英兩隊將比賽的消息公佈以後、英國一般人多少總覺得有些新奇、中國人不但也懂得玩足球、而且居然派起隊來參加世界運動會、因為他們平常、都只拿「中國人踢足球、」句話常做開玩笑的口頭語用的、英國報紙呢、知道我隊在南洋一帶的成績、似乎有些担心、怕出冷門、有幾家報紙甚至於說、中國隊簡直有「威嚇」英國隊「尊嚴」的可能性、比賽結果、我隊雖以零比二失敗、然而在塲的觀衆、幷歐洲各國報紙都、一致推許我隊的球藝、「中國隊也是國際第一流業餘足球隊」的論調、到處可以聽到、事實上我們幷不算失敗、</p>
<p>一位英國小姐介紹</p>
<p>柏林比賽時、我隊表演精彩、論我球藝决不在於英隊之下不幸失敗、所以格外得到觀衆的同情、觀衆中有一位司密士小姐、她的爸爸是一個英國業餘足球團體　凌士恩司令Islington　Corinthians領隊、當時她自動託她的爸爸、替我隊接洽來倫敦比賽、經過幾度商量的結果、我隊應邀、决定在倫敦與英國業餘足球隊比賽兩决、頭一塲對柯凌士恩司隊、第二塲對英國業餘足球錦標隊卡慈耳司隊Casuals</p>
<p>中國足球隊於八月二十八日　間抵倫敦、僑胞方面、担任招待出力最多的人、為中華恊曾幹事張似旅先生、英國方面、司密士先生特別熱心、中國隊各派員、雖經過四個月的長途旅行、先後三十五决比賽、負傷的人員、幾乎過了半數、但個個依然振作精神、終留下一個極良好的印像、英國各報除刋登我隊隊員照片以外、多半更特載專文介紹我隊的作戰能力、球王李惠堂君、似乎從前老了一些，經過這幾個月的征程、臉上顯露倦容、小黑炭陳鎭和君瘦了許多大約因為此君每戰　不顧身的緣故、自然這也難怪他、受了旅途幷足球塲上的磨折、連孫　順君都不像有胖子氣槪、何况別人、全隊中氣色最好的一位要算譚江柏君、譚君的體格、一望去你就知道他應該是一位足球健將、可是你同他接談表來、他都又文氣不過的了、</p>
<p>對於「歐洲生活過得慣嗎」的問題、小黑炭說、「幾個月來沒有吃中國飯、整天西餐、苦透了、早一天回去早一天好」、徐亞輝君說、出來兩個月以後、就想歸家、早日回國、這幾乎是全體隊員的口號、</p>
<p>隊員某君曾向記者談起他對於中國隊球藝的意見、他說、我們的踢延球幷沒有拜過老師、我們只看人家怎麽踢法、覺得他踢得好、就把它偷學足球健將而組成的、內中有七入會出席過此次世界運動會，英國　郵報說、這一隊似乎在柏林比賽的英國代表隊為强、</p>
<p>在開賽以前、由軍樂隊先奏中英兩國國歌、中國隊在一萬五千人的觀衆熱烈歡迎之下、於英隊開球後即取攻勢、我隊藝球高强、合作純熟、上半時幾手全佔上風博得不少掌聲、開賽不五分鐘、卽由馮景祥首先攻入一球、二十分　內、李惠堂得判陳鎭和傅來的球、在英內衛監視之下、李仍舉足遠射、簪我隊連獲二球、李此球踢來淸晰、美觀、好像射來毫不費氣力、球塲上掌聲動雷英國新聞彙報記者、譽李君此球為他數年來所看見的許多最妙球中的一球、英隊反攻、受阻於黃紀良、無所獲、三十分鐘時、陳鎭和在英門前傳中一球、英守門趨救跌倒在地上、球對空門、惜馮景祥遲到一步、錯過一個良機、此後英隊氣勢頓盛、中國球門幾乎全處於被包圍的形勢下、黃紀良胆大心細、身手敏捷、無論高球低球、全數接住、逼得英隊前鋒毫無發展餘地、直到將近上半時完塲時、始由英隊中堅於角球時頂人一球、</p>
<p>下半時一開始、英隊依靠壯健的體格、大有愈戰愈勇的氣槪、我隊以勞對逸、本來已算吃虧、加之、球員譚江　、黃紀良等都帶傷勉强出塲應過來、實際上幷沒有完全釗家所以無法同職業足球隊相比、我問他、作戰時是否領隊人從旁指點有沒有定的陣勢他說、沒有、我們是各自為戰的多半是個人乘機應變、這也許就是中國隊白尺竿頭未能更進一步的原因、不過、容啟兆博士說、他回國後、擬向體育協進會建議、聘請一英籍足球敎練來華、我們希望他的計劃能够早日實現、也許四年後中國足球隊有機會使中國國旗、在世界運動會塲上飄揚、</p>
<p>第一日比賽情形</p>
<p>對於為柯凌士恩司隊、時間八月三十一日　後六時三十分、地點、倫敦Highbury足球塲、結果我隊以二對三失敗、上半時一·比一我隊勝、射球人、李惠堂一、馮景祥一、當日我險陣勢如下、</p>
<p>蔡文禮　黃紀良　李天生</p>
<p>李國威　徐亞輝　梁勞照</p>
<p>陳鎭和　譚江柏　李惠堂　馮景祥　楊水益</p>
<p>漢隊陣勢如下、</p>
<p>愛理司薩　哈德　柏策耳</p>
<p>特克來夫　坦寗敦　伊司呑</p>
<p>芬區　路易士　歐士邦　司波士　戈林司</p>
<p>射球人、坦寗敦一、歐士邦一、路易士一、</p>
<p>此决英隊名為柯凌士恩司隊、實際上是集合各業餘足球隊的精銳、再加上海陸軍中戰、全隊精神遠不及上半時、英隊至此確比我隊佔優勢、所幸守門黃紀良日來有驚人的進步、不慌不忙、救出好幾個幾乎都是無法挽救的險球、有一次一英前鋒帶球已迫近中國球門、此球看來十之八九早無希望、黃守門却有這種胆量出對方不意、乘機躍出、倒在地上、該球遂被迫成角球、黃紀良是當日中國隊中的英雄、他每救一球、觀衆就報他一陣然烈的掌聲、英國每日快報說、黃紀良是中國隊的明星、他的救球獲得了觀衆的心、新聞彙報說、中國的守門球員是一個預備員、但他救球的技能與敏捷、就是英國足球隊中最好的守門員也不過如此、每日先驅報說、黃紀良救了這許多險球、還是一個預備員、那末那位中國正式守門球員的妙技可想而知的了、話雖如此設，但在完塲前二十分鐘終於被英隊前鋒先後攻進兩球、成為三對二的比數、我隊失敗、我隊吐戰內衛人才很出色、蔡文禮並徐亞輝特別賣力、</p>
<p>前鋒小黑炭奔跑迅速、不讓英人、造成不少射門的機會、為我隊唯一的機器人、</p>
<p>比賽完後、我隊隊員大受塲中觀象的歡迎、因為他們能够了解中國隊的眞實本領、當我們走出球塲來的時候、路中還聽到觀衆到處在向僑胞打招呼、這一塲踢得眞好、這就是我們的收穫、</p>
<p>第二天英國各報對於我隊的表演、大加讚美、每日郵報說、中國隊隊員的名字、是一個謎、可是他們踢起球來、一點也不難懂、每日快報說、中國人踢一港道地的足球、每日先驅報說、「中國隊技術比英國隊高明、他們的失敗是運氣不好一、諸如此類的論調、我們還能够有什麽要求、論球　、我隊個人技術都已臻上乘、不過缺點也有、第一隊員過於疲乏、氣力不足、不但在塲中跑人家不過、而且到了最後一二十分鐘、幾乎自已都走不動、輸球的原因就在這里、因為歐洲比賽足球時間、為九十分鐘、比中國足球賽多二十分鍾、其决、合作工夫不够、沒有預定的陣綫、尤其是前鋒間彼此的聯絡不靈敏、所以往往前鋒得到球後、不是向無人處傳遞、就是須先站住看自家人到底在那單、於是屢决多失去射門的良機、相反的、英隊前鋒一得球、便毫不思索互相傳遞、立刻達到我隊的第二道防綫、第二、以體格關係、脚頭不够强硬、前鋒射門無力、至於搶球工夫、似乎也還不及英隊、不過、中國人頭腦聰明、思想敏捷、於是有許多妙球多出乎敵人意料之外、這一點是我隊的特長、而且也靠　人的天分、不是甩死工夫所能够學得來的、</p>
<p>此外、中國足球隊替國家增光的地方、尙有兩點、在　林比賽後、德報已譽中英足球賽時雙方球員舉動文雅、處處符合運動家的精神、是世界運動會中最理想的一塲比賽、可作大家的模範、在倫敦比賽後、每日郵報對於我隊這一點也特別讚揚、中國隊隊員只踢球、沒有踢人、這是我們覺得很可以向全世界驕傲的地方、另外一點、歐洲報紙大部分都登載及口國隊隊員的出身、醫生、商人、軍官、警察、拳術家、學生、社會上、各色人等都有、這個就足以證明足球遝動在中國的普遍化、事實上、大部分我們所希望的都已達到了目的、中國足球隊此行所差的、就是一個名義上的勝利、</p>
<p>第二日比賽情形</p>
<p>對手為卡慈耳司隊、時間九月一日午後六時、地點倫敦Selhurst　Park足球塲、結果我隊以二對五失敗、上半時一比一、射球人、李惠堂一、孫錦順一、</p>

<p>英隊以業餘錦標隊卡慈耳司隊為基礎、再加上其他强隊健將數人組織而成、實力似不及柯凌士恩司隊雄厚、惟我隊以連日作戰過多、雖以正式隊員九人出戰、而表演的結果、反不及第一戰、我隊開球後、即被英隊搶去、英前鋒帶隊進攻、被中國內衛攔住、中國前鋒再度反攻也無效、此時球來球去、雙方雖無所得、但英隊似佔上風、包家平門前生意興隆、幸他身手敏捷、得平安無事、中國隊左右兩翼、因跑不過英人、殊少貢獻、曹桂成老矣、得球後每被英人搶去、弄得看台上旁觀的中國隊員、大家着急、因上半時不立功、下半時就更無希望、在這　局面下、我隊顯然處於不利的地位、上半時完塲前二分鐘、被英右翼先攻進一球、這一來大家更加担心、但世事每出人意料之外、吾極泰來、英隊獲不到球一分鐘、中國前鋒得球後、擁至英門前、英隊守門衝出、而已將球拍出不遠、李惠堂眼快從人叢中趕前一脚、等到英內衛發覺時、球早巳滾進空門去了、此球之得、全出意外、大家看到球在繼裏、才不禁大笑起來、上半時一比一、無勝負、</p>
<p>下半時開塲後、不到三分鐘、孫錦順得到一球、不加思索、立刻向英鬥遠射、球應聲入網，博得不少　聲、李國威君在看台上說、咱們現在有了本錢了、可是此後中國隊即入於不振的狀態、雖包家平、徐亞輝、多方努力抵抗、小黑炭顯出他跑全塲的本領、始終奮鬥、但仍不能减少英隊的攻勢、終於在二十分鐘內被英隊先後再攻入兩球、造　二比二的局面、此時中國　知勝利已無望、只求不再多輸、所以更取守勢、但大家　感到疲乏、尤其是前鋒、進不能攻、退不能守、就在這時候、球員的體格、顯然比個人的球藝重要、假如此次我隊前鋒五人、大家都有小黑炭一樣的身體、這一塲比賽勝利的决不會是英隊、在最後五分鐘內被英隊再接連攻進兩球、結果我隊以五比二失敗、</p>
<p>第二天英國各報的記載、多半說我隊過於疲乏、所以失敗、論調仍多致同情、這是我隊在歐最後的一次比賽、希望大家歸國後時常會記起、我們所吃虧的只在於體力、輸球又在於最後的五分鐘、（九月三日倫敦）</p>

<p>標花升降平凡　標花前巿開盤、美棉微漲比半、二盤後因紗巿上漲、廠方對於原料實然購辦、且地頭售價不鬆、買氣頓起、上日大最拋空之長和、亦來拖進、巿價步步上升、查明德·合興·愼記·大昶·生源·福康·等則賣出、惟裕大·長和·兩號補定甚夥、結果各月比上日收盤價均漲一角五分至二角、午後開盤、巿態平定、上下五分、二三盤仍無變化、迨至收盤轉緊、回小五分至一角、結果各月比上午收盤價跌一角、查賣出愼記四千三百担、合興三千二百担、明德二千九百担、大孚一千二百担、義成一千二百担、望泰興千五百担、買進裕大七千七百担、興昌四千八百担、森康一千八百担、長餘二千担、潤康二千八百担、永昌二千担、信誠六千二百担、源興昌二千六百担、長和七千六百担、福康三千五百担、恒益一千二百担、長豐一千四百担、茲將一日間最高低及收盤價列左、</p>

<h3>高次客秈售價日跌</h3>
<p>昨日客秈到頭、續有長江一帶整批抵埠、存底旣充、來源不絕、巿面續見無神、昨日本客去化雖活、終以供量太多、行販客帮均主貶價急脫、因此高次各檔一律步削三五分至八九分不等、倘無粵帮暢辦、跌風尚須見盛也、昨粵帮去化尚活、辦去糙米五千包、寗波與本街亦有問津、全日開出江西米二千七百三十包、湘米三千八百二十包、沙灘糙米二千二百包、其他各米均無進出、</p>
<h3>新米湧到行巿步降</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源較前轉旺、共到有三十二三號、貨共六千餘石、內中以新貨居多、故若新粳際此本銷續滯、巿色疲頹不堪、行情再跌二角、新百哥包胃去七十包、而因前巿時鮮貨轟得太高、至暴降三尺有奇、至於　破來源漸稀、略貶幾分、薄破包胃雖有青島帮辦五六百包、但零化不良、是以能有包子採辦者當可平定、餘則均削一二角不等、新蘆尖目連日銳跌後、城鄉店胃漸見活動、故雖到夥、跌風已能　殺、略修角許新羊尖適相反、短去角半至　角許、陳新變陰元未到無巿、</p>

<p>昨日橫濱因假期停巿、紐約絲巿微漲、人心仍看好面、本埠白廠絲巿、殊覺清堅、用戶洋行均暫停採辦、而賣方絲價、仍堅挺逾恒、故絲交不多、巿情擯持、輯里絲及川魯經亦僅零星賣買、價亦隨漲、昨日洋莊成交八七七包、用戶合購二十包、內白廠裕源一六　一八價六七五元之售盤、尤稱堅挺云、</p>
<h3>紅茶整個推銷計畫進行順利</h3>
<p>皖贛紅茶總運銷處、對於巿上剩存之七千餘箱、前曾擬定整個推銷計畫、與汪裕泰茶店、一再交涉、已有端倪、惟因顧全茶商利益計、在不背整個推銷原則下、規定昨今兩日為期、凡備有的欵之商家、均可提出、另行售與洋行、因此昨日恊和錦隆等行、均大量吸收、業已發出二三千箱、其餘大部份、將由汪裕泰全部銷納云、</p>
<p>又據茶棧業公會報告、日來綠茶巿面、均與外洋買方電報交易、如復電對巿價相符、隨時成交、昨日買方仍續有少數來電交易、零星者恊和寶隆及天祥各進抽珍數十箱、售價穩定、華茶進婺珍百餘箱、價六十元左右、及白頭行續有貢熙交易、平水茶前錦隆拆大帮五六帮後、三陽一帮亦相繼售出云、</p>
<h3>海味　新干貝歉收價昂　——葉菜過時銷呆——</h3>
<p>干貝　新貨歉收、來源絕少、因之本巿行情、日見加緊、前批計到十二箱、號盤開升二百零五元、且行方進胃濃厚、不以價昂而却步、後如到貨仍稀、巿有續漲之勢、</p>
<p>葉菜　為天時步冷、客銷轉懈、行家存貨、殊少問津、且查各檔存額頗豐、以致供過於求、故巿逐步下鬆、現售廂館大方玻璃高貨、價一百四十五元、黃色次貨僅售七十元、寗波貨上莊八十元、中莊六十元、下莊四五十元、</p>
<h3>糖巿　荷赤軋缺升加三角　—期貨拋兌二百噸……海南赤升二角</h3>

<h3>周遇吉夫婦</h3>
<p>— 鄭侃嬨</p>
<p>—明未的守將，再奪一對周遇　吉夫婦，明步亡了—</p>
<p>三百多年前，正是明朝的衰世，錦州衛有一個七十多歲的退老錦衣衛僉事臥病在床上，他半身不遂已經三年了。他的遭遇很壞，她的職是世襲的，上七歲父親死了他便襲職做錦衣衛指揮僉事，壯年時曾隨楊鎬經略朝鮮（在公元一五九七年，明神宗萬歷二十五年），以軍功陞遷了錦衣衛指揮使，到了晚年得罪了太監魏忠賢，又降回原職。他退老回來，本來該是他的兒子遇吉襲職，無如他只有這一個兒子，什麼親屬都沒有，遇吉不放心離開家庭，寗可捨棄了職位在家伺候老父。但是這位周老先生，生平慷慨助人，並不曾留得一個錢做養老費，現在全靠遇吉打獵過日。入山打獵至少也需要一日半日的工夫，病人躺在床上，要茶要水一時也離不開人，因此遇吉非到柴米已盡，萬不得己時不肯出去打獵。有時他全身都披掛好，到屋後牽馬去，從破洞裏低頭一窺，看見父親神色不好，他不忍走，寗可回頭握餓；有時他走到半道，遠遠聽見父親的呻吟聲（當然是一種心理作用），心裏非常難受，立卽勒馬加鞭跑回來、至於他父親，也異常的，關心他兒子；遇吉的臉本來長得胖胖的，周老先生總覺得兒子一天瘦似天；相識的人本來誰都敬重遇吉的，周老先生總是担心兒子會被人欺負。遇吉才辭了他出去，跟着門兒一動，他便以為兒子回來了。遇吉出外打獵，天色稍為有一點變動，他便流着眼淚禱吿，一直等到兒子回來才罷。</p>
<p>有一天，遇吉出外打獵，不多時，天忽然全黃起來。周老先生猜想快要括大風，否則也要下雨，心裏又怕又憂，不斷的自言自語道：「兒，快有大風雨了，回來罷！』等了一會不見兒子回來，他便改口道：『天老爺，改天括風下雨罷；為着蒼生不要苦壞了我的兒子。」</p>
<p>其實周老先生一切都是過慮的，遇吉從小受過嚴格的鍛鍊，現在非常結實雄壯，拉幾百斤弓，輕輕地像無事一樣。他立志甚高，、很能耐勞受苦，就是赴湯蹈火他也不當是什磨一回事，何况一點什麼風兒雨兒呢？記得四年前，遇吉在京營裏做遊擊，那時京營的軍官多是勛戚和中官的子弟，習慣驕奢淫逸，看見遇吉勤儉厚道，他們就輕視他，遇吉不但毫不介意，反諫他們道：「諸君都是紈袴子，怎能抵當大敵呢？何不於無事時練練武事，為將來之用，免得白費了國家的　祿。」他們聽了遇吉的話，都笑他迂腐。遇吉不管他們，努力習武，所以人人都墮落下去，而他却體健神壯。遇吉這次出去打獵，决定要為父親準備一二個月的糧食，他怕破壞了他的計劃，不敢想目前分別彼此的難過，只想一二個月能够父子守着寸步不離的幸福　正當遇吉在山中追兔逐鹿的時換，家裏忽然來了一位貴客，這貴客姓劉，是一個現任總兵。他未曾得志時，常在周家作客，受過周老先生許多好處，為着感恩圖報，曾把他的愛女冰娘許給遇吉。後來他自己發迹而周家中落，他有心悔婚了。周老先生也覺得「齊大非偶」，從不提起這一門婚事，打算劉總兵一開口退婚他便答應了。不想劉總兵看不起這個親家，甚至想直接把冰娘嫁給別人，不和周家辦退婚的手續。幸虧冰娘心向遇吉，不肯賴婚，據理和父親力爭。原來冰娘從小和遇吉住在一塊，遇吉從敎習裏學得來的武藝，都一件一件敎給她。他們有過海誓山盟，說將來兩人要結為夫婦，一塊捐軀報國的。劉總兵受不了他的女兒理直氣壯的責備，同時也因為女兒太能耐，管不來，只好答應招遇吉來入贅總兵府。他現在親自造訪，就是為着這一件事。周老先生覺得遇吉遲早是要娶媳婦的，劉總兵旣然不願退婚，他只好讓遇吉入贅。事情還未說好，風忽然大刮起來，周老先生心裏惦着遇吉，總談小起勁。劉總兵以為親家有意待慢他，正想回去，托辭來哄冰娘。剛要吿辭，遇吉回來了，這一天他僅打得一個半獵，因為他在山上看見天色越變越可怕，記着屋裏的窗戶未關好，怕父親吃虧，只得趁早同來。</p>
<p>劉總兵自從遇吉十七歲那年離開周家，到如今已經八個年頭了。他看見遇吉長得更加英偉，不由得不敬愛起來，於是他又坐下來對遇吉說明來意。遇吉站在劉　兵面前，拱手恭聽。聽完，雙眼看着父親，什磨話也不說。周老先生懂得兒子的意思是讓他做主，他覺得為遇吉的前途着想，非答應不可，因此對劉總兵說道；『老弟，難道你替遇吉想的還有不週到嗎？我相信你，我答應你，你就挑一個好日子帶遇吉去入贅罷。」</p>
<p>遇吉本來守禮不發表意見，不想父親對於劉總兵的要求，竟不馬上全盤答應，到了此時，他不能不說話了。他轉身對父親說道：「老爹，劉叔叔因為老爹年老多病，曉得兒子一個人伺候不週到，送他的愛女過來幫助兒子，這是兒子萬分感激的。至於要兒子離開老爹來做他的　壻，兒子誓死不敢從命。劉叔叔是明理人，想他不會這樣幹。」他的聲音說得很嚮亮，每一個字都讓劉總兵聽得淸楚。劉總兵不敢再提什麼，只說回家磋商過再行定奪。</p>
<p>劉總兵回去幾天，打發人把冰娘送來，從此周劉兩家很少來往了。據說劉總兵回到家裏，又想賴婚，冰娘和他爭論了幾天，他一時氣起使人送冰娘到周家來，聲明此後不理她。</p>
<p>冰娘到了周家，周家馬上繁榮起來。出外打獵，在家事親，兩夫婦輪流擔任。打獵之餘，他們又從事畜牧，不上兩年，便有羊一千頭了。可惜周老先生染了這個症候，不能久享，到了兒媳婦進門第三年，他一切機能停止作用，很安樂的死在兒子的懷裏。</p>
<p>周老先生死後，滿洲常來犯境，越鬧越利害，錦州也不能安居了。有一天，冰娘對遇吉說道：『國家這樣受外人侵凌，正是好漢馬革裏屍的時候，你何不馬上從軍去？我想父親那裏幾一定需要人用，你去罷！你不要發愁我在這裏後人作伴，我可以回娘家去，骨肉之愛是天性，父親不會不收留我的。如果你不喜歡把我們的家常散了，我也願意在這裏住着。我常常到山裏打獵，認識了二十個胡婦，她們都是騎射精捷，勇悍非常的人。我已經和她們結成生死之交，我打算你一離開，我便接她們過來和我同住，天天和她們一塊學習武藝，等你得到獨當一面有權收容我們時，我們一定都來投到你的麾下，為國效力去。誰說女子不能救國？誰說女子不能衝鋒陷陣？我們要打破歷史的紀錄，給後人一個好榜樣。』冰娘說得非常的果决有力，眉宇間顯出凛凛不可侵犯的氣槪。</p>
<p>遇吉聽了冰娘的話，很受感動。剛好侍婢捧茶進來，遇吉接着茶碗，不假思索，碰的一聲連茶帶碗擲在地上，碎磁黃水飛濺一地。侍婢驚嚇一跳，冰娘忙揮手呌她出去。遇吉回頭跪在冰娘面前，指着地對她說道：『我和你立誓粉身碎骨，肝腦塗地以報國如何？』冰娘忙還拜道：『這正是我的心願呢。』</p>
<p>遇吉慢慢地扶冰娘起來，對她嘆道：『唉！你，是榮腸，是俠骨、是孝子，是忠臣——』忽然他又轉調說，『妹妹，我相信你是了解我的，我近年之所以積聚起家，並非志在「問舍求田」，實在一半是為娛父晚景，一半是想輸財助邊。現在不幸老父死了。』他不覺滴下淚來，『產業留來有什麼用？都拿去散了充軍餉罷！我本來是在京營裏當過職的，用不着投岳父那裏去。你呢，還是在家等着我好，為的是有空可以常去看看我父親的墳墓。等到需要你幫助時，我會親來或者派人來接你的。那二十位胡婦，你接她們來一塊住罷，國家有事，正是需要人才的時候，什麼人用不着。不過你們要記住，千萬不要荒疏了弓馬，閒時不練習，急時那裏有得用呢？』</p>
<p>冰娘一切都答應了他，過了幾大，各事弄妥了，遇吉便到墓前拜別了父親，離錦州入關投軍去。到了崇禎十七年，遇吉因為累立戰功，幾决陞遷，已經做到鎭守山西兼關門代州三關總兵，官授太子少帥中軍都督府在都督，自然冰娘和各　婦都已來軍中服務了。</p>
<p>那時不但邊警緊急，並且中原的流寇猖獗到了不得，陜西山西已經失守，畿內土崩瓦解，只遇吉夫婦所守着的寗武一關岌岌然像中流砥柱一般沒有陷落。遇吉見消息太緊，立卽增加鎖兵二千，以熊通統帥。兵隊來到河干，叛將陳尚志迎賊，迫令熊通回鎭說遇吉降，遇吉怒叱　道。『我受國厚恩，怎能跟從你們叛逆？你領兵二千，不能堵賊，反來替賊作說客嗎？』跟着傳令道，『馬上斬决熊通。』熊通斬後，遇吉使標下提塘都司楊志榮把首級帶到京師去，並且請求救兵。</p>
<p>到了二月十五日那一天，流寇李自成帶着十幾萬衆直偪寗武關。自成自從打破了太原，乘勝席捲破竹而來，意志很驕，滿不在乎的對部下說道：『寗武一關，既非雄險，而兵力又微，要打破牠，簡直是等於摧枯拉朽。你們替我傳檄，說，「寗武關五日不下，便要實行大屠殺了」。』</p>
<p>遇吉新守寗武關，一切都要重新佈置，然費心力，而且這個關素乏兵備，遇吉日夜練兵，盡選城中壯勇僅得幾千人，和賊軍相比，彼衆我寡，眞有螳臂當車之嘆。遇吉明知京師必無救兵來，卽有也無法趕到，心裏非常焦急，不免憂形於色。冰娘看見，深怕誤了行軍大計，抽空悄悄的勸慰遇吉道：『臨危非鎭定不為功，勝有勝的打算，敗有敗的打算，盡人事以聽天，沒有什麼值得我們憂慮的。』</p>
<p>『然則你打算什麼？』遇吉還是不改憂色的問着。</p>
<p>『打算做斷頭將軍。你「粉身碎骨，肝腦塗地」之誓，今日眞可以實踐了。』她說時氣壯神和，眞使遇吉得了不少的鼓舞和安慰。遇吉欣然說道：『像你所說的一樣，我也决定了。』</p>
<p>遇吉於是召所部兵士，激以忠義，兩夫婦身先士卒，等賊未安營便殺出來，直搗賊的中堅，殺了賊軍許多精銳。無奈賊人多，鋒雖挫而不却，轉戰十幾决，賊已經逼到城下來了。遇吉夫婦盡力拒守，放砲殺傷賊軍萬多人。遇吉的作戰計劃是白天列兵城外，以戰為守；晚上收兵入城，登陴打擊。到了第三日，火藥已盡；有一位軍官對遇吉說道：『賊勢力太大，不如和他們通欵罷？』遇吉答道：『戰才三日，竟殺了萬多賊，你們還怕什麼？幸而得勝，一軍都未患義；不幸戰敗，你們把我獻給賊便無事了。』遇吉說完，又開門奮擊，殺死幾千賊。</p>
<p>到了晚上，賊以為雙方殺到精疲力倦，大家都需要休息，不會生事的，因此毫應戒備。不想半夜遇吉夫婦督率着百壯士，縋出城外，直闖人賊營殺賊。諸賊驚起，會皇中一人不及甲，馬不及鞍」已身首分離了。那時殺賊最多的，是那二十個胡婦的一枝生力軍。賊兵在火光下，見衆娘子各披着銀甲，拿着明晃晃的長刀，跑得飛快而無聲，正在驚懾她們的威風，猛不提防，寒光一閃，忽然受到一尖痛，不覺頭血已淋在身上了。原來胡婦在遇吉部下是照裨將一樣支餉，遇吉選二十個武藝超羣的健丁，使各娶一個胡婦，臨陣非到至急時不役使她練們。她們得到充分的訓和休養，因此都能殺敵無算</p>
<p>这次刦營把賊軍打得大敗，他們害怕，乘夜退二十里。此時城裏已矢絕糧盡，勉强再支持了半個月，援兵還不到。遇吉無法可想，决定力戰而死，於是各地先伏健兵，開門僞降。自成知道守兵除投降無生路，也就相信了，使賊兵萬多人進城。賊兵才進了城，遇吉卽將城門閘放下，號砲一聲，伏乒四起，把賊兵殺得片甲不留，賊軍四個驍將也重傷了。</p>
<p>自成因為受過屢次的慘敗，頹喪到極，相信寗武關無法可破，怕再相持下去會弄到全軍覆沒，有心逃回老巢去。賊裏有人為自成戲謀道『大王十幾萬衆竟不能敵幾千人，怎能號令天下？現在城裏的精銳已盡，所留老弱也不多，還不趁此時把城攻下嗎？我衆彼寡，如戰時能分別主客，以十擊一，斷無不勝之理。大王可出奇制勝，吩咐兵士去帽做記認，看見戴帽的人就擊殺。』　　自成聽了他的話，傾兵環攻。遇吉的兵士，有一人敵十人的，有一人敵百人的，勢力這樣懸殊，還能支持了四畫夜。城破，居民感激遇吉夫婦忠義，冒死來和殘兵合作，與賊短兵相接，巷戰、抗拒，因此全城百姓很壯烈的同歸於盡，兒童婦女也未有一個人肯受屈投降。遇吉領着市民巷戰，徒步跳盪，槍斷刀折，還能用手拉殺幾十人。遇吉最後受了重傷，被賊生擒過去。遇吉罵賊不絕口，賊把他縛在高竿上，亂箭射死他，全身集矢如蝟。事後賊兵為遇吉忠勇所感，有許多人為他下淚。</p>
<p>當着巷戰正在劇烈的時候，冰娘帶着婦女登屋，負隅死抗。她們每一支箭都能射死一個人，從無虛發的。賊兵不敢迫近，放火焚屋，她們也不下來，站着讓火燒死。同時那二十個　婦在另一方面出寄驕敵。她們躱在屋裏，開盡內外門戶，把遇吉所乘的駿馬栓在大門上。賊衆是很怕遇吉的，本來不敢進來，但想冒險得到這匹駿馬，大家爭着去牽引牠，　婦在內乘　連　强弩，射死幾白人，等到矢已經射盡了她們才一個個跳到火裏去。</p>
<p>白成这次打人了寗武關，表面是得勝了，其實　的損失眞大。他檢閱兵隊，發現前後殺死的將士快有十萬人，而剩下的大都是殘廢波弱的。想在這裏養兵蓄銳罷，但是看看他听得到的一個城，未有一個人遺留，未有一斗粟存儲，未有一件可用的兵器，未有一塊能　衣的布，房屋不是全燬便是半倒，四壁一片瓦礫，簡直是等於一間廢墟。自成看見這樣的情形，不斷的搖頭嘆道：『這樣的得勝，不勝也罷了。早知如此，我一定不來打寗武關。遇吉這個人眞利害！唉！也是合該我們倒霉，幹嗎我們不先用反間計，等到已經調虎離山才來進攻呢？』他不勝悔恨的咽了一口口水又說道：『我們本來打算直抵帝京，可是現在誰敢作如此想？大同有兵十萬，宣府有兵十萬，居庸有兵十萬，陽和等鎭有兵合二十萬，如果都像寗武關，我們還有</p>
<p>一個人剩嗎？不如回陜西去，等兵隊休息擴充好，再找過另一條吉利的路來。』賊將都點首稱是，决定明早班師回陜。於是諸賊將圍着商量怎樣使傷病的兵慢慢的退，談到夜深，忽然報到大同總兵姜壞使人送降表來。諸賊非常驚喜，忙設宴加意欵待。才坐定，又報到宜府總兵王承允的降表也到，並且派一百騎來迎。自成歡喜過望，馬上改退為進，利用各叛將做前鋒，長驅直進京師，迫死了大明思宗皇帝。</p>
<p>到了京師的賊兵，有半面的，有折手斷足的，都是在寗武關戰時所砍傷。他們咬着指頭告訴人道：『周總兵眞是好漢，再有寗武這樣一個鎭，我們那能來到這裏？難得他的夫人也是像他一樣的節烈。』遇吉夫婦的威名很快傳遍京城，談論他們的人未有不驚嘆悚服，稱他們做大人和夫人的。</p>

<h3>從「論語」到「逸經」</h3>
<p>— 宜夫</p>
<p>—幽默小品漸有沒落之勢—</p>
<p>自林語堂先生提倡幽默小品，出版「論語」半月刋以來，近數年間，幽默的空氣，滙漫周遭，好像把整個的中國，都籠罩於幽默及晚明小品的零氛圍中。</p>
<p>「論語」以標榜幽默而起，提　晚明小品為宗，於是這個幽默，那個幽默，作文幽默，談話幽默，甚至電影院以及各種商店的廣吿，也無不奉幽默為正宗，標幽默為摩登，幽默的紅運，眞交到極點了。</p>
<p>爾時書店出版家，也趨向這條路走，於是袁中郞又突然抬頭，你標點，我校印，甚至有以此而成名的。</p>
<p>由林語堂提倡幽默，連帶晚明小品文交了紅運，更連帶一折八扣書風湧而起，有許多書店老闆及設站脚的海派文人且靠此吃飯這恐怕也是提倡幽默正宗的巨子林語堂先生有所想不到吧。</p>
<p>幽默作品之有無價值，這自有公論，我以為「高度的嚴肅」的昨品，「甜蜜的刺」的嬸笑，使世人看了這樣的幽默，會覺得欲哭不能，欲笑不得神情，這乃是文學的別調，太史公滑稽列傳中，所謂，「談言微中，亦可以解紛」原不可厚非，我們也歡迎之不暇</p>
<p>但談何容易？要像這樣的幽默恰到好處的作品，實是一件極大容易的事；因之畫虎不成，，反而類狗，遂產生了無聊的低級的趣味的作品，使一般人都趨向不負責任，以打譚取笑為能事，一唱百效，以寳貴的光陰，用之於無意義的工作，「淸淡」「消閒」，恐怕隨之而亡國。</p>
<p>但我們要追究其幽默由何而起，由何而風湧一時？這也正有其時代環境的關係在。晋人非生而好為淸談，生而喜歡出世，以環境之無出路，故不得不借風月詩酒以消閑。現時中國，固一極危殆的時代，生為中國人，並不是個個無血氣的男兒，有血氣而不能正當發洩，因而一部份無克服環境勇氣的人，便走入幽默嬉笑的途中，這也是難怪的。徐訏先生答朱光潛先生的一封公開信中，我覺得有幾句話還說得公道，不妨抄錄如下：</p>
<p>「我也是以為最健全的理想是多方面的發展，但我也不反對一個人的私好，同時在文化史上我們也常常知道有時是有些時髦有些風行的東西，用一點物觀的態度來觀察，這種現象也是有必然的背景的。冷眼說來，這種波浪的週期性也是很有趣的事情。袁中郞之流在淸朝受過壓迫，到現在抬抬頭也是平常事，不久自然也會平靜到一個適當的標價的。我不知道這種現象，用什磨來解釋好，或者是一種物性吧？或者是辯證法的正反合的演進。總之這種事情是有必然的消長的，自然人力能够促成其早生，</p>
<p>也能促成其早死。……</p>
<p>幽默之起來和袁中郞的抬頭，原是平常的事，但要他成為風氣，實是不必的。而且因模倣而俗濫，其弊便不在少，朱光潛先生對此說得很透澈，他對徐訏君的公開信中是有下列一段的說明的：</p>
<p>「我對於晚明小品文也有同樣的感覺，它自身是本很新鮮，經許多人一模倣，就成為一種溫調了。我始終相信在藝術方面，一個人有個人的獨到，如果自己沒有獨到，專去模倣別人的一種獨到的風格，這在學童時代做練習，固無不可，如果把它當作一種正經事業做，則似乎大可不必。」</p>
<p>我以為最懇切而指出幽默派的無謂，提倡晚明小品文之不必，要算是朱光潛先生的這封公開信了。</p>
<p>自「論語一刊後接續而起來的，尚有「人間世和「宇宙風」。「人間世」和「宇宙風」可以說都是「神語」的姊妹刋物。「論語」已出到八十三期，已有三年半的歷史了，幽默的風氣，綿延到這般長，不能不算是語堂先生們的努力。「論語最初是由林語堂和陶亢德編輯的，後來因另開拓了「人間世一，遂由語堂而轉交給他的幫手亢德編輯了。</p>
<p>「人間世」是由林語堂任總編，徐訏和陶亢德任編輯的，可是到了四十二期，與良友圖書公司不知為了什麼，終於不繼續出版了。</p>
<p>「論語」自第八十三期起，陶亢德却退了手，由郁達夫和邵洵美編輯，現在正宗的嫡派，却只存了「宇宙風」。　（未完）</p>
<h3>孔子</h3>
<p>— 獨秀</p>
<p>童行白編著　初中學生文庫之一　中華書局出版</p>
<p>盲目的崇拜和盲目的反對在學術上同樣是千古的罪人。關於孔老夫子，曾受過數千年來人們盲目的崇拜，但也會受過人們無理由的攻訐和謾罵。崇拜他的人們很少把孔子的學說加以精詳的研究，攻擊他們的人們更不願把孔子的學說加以理瞭。於是在今日中國社會中對於孔子簡直造成了下列這種現象：反對孔子的人們罵尊孔者為復古派，思想開倒車；尊崇孔子的人們罵反孔者為過激派，思想中毒。這種不求甚解盲目批評的人們，不論尊孔也好，反孔也好，不僅是孔老夫子的罪人，而且是學術界上的蟊賊！</p>
<p>所以我們無論對於那一位大思想家大政治家或大敎育家的學說，除了澈底研究他的思想學說再下評語以外，絕對沒有理由任意加以批評的可能，否則，這批評决不是眞正的批評，而是盲目的謾罵。</p>
<p>孔子是中國數千年來一致承認的大政治家，大敎育家，和大思想家，然而對於孔子的舉說如以澈底的研究和予以系統的論述的專書，簡直絕無而僅有。這，我們不能認為一個大笑話。而且，不僅是笑話，簡直是中國學術界上的奇恥！</p>
<p>童行白先生在中華書局出版的「初中學生文庫」中，編著以一本「孔子」，雖然不過五萬言左右的一本單行本，然而關於孔子的生平和學說的內容，却已加以了精審的論述，這，我們不能不認以為值得欣喜的事。</p>
<p>在這册白薄的單行本中，我們祗須把它章目的編製和分類，就可以曉到它包羅之廣大與精深。第一編為「孔子的生平和環境」，在這一編中，把孔子的家世，幼年時代，壯年時代，晚年時代等，論述無遺。尤其值得注意的，就是把孔子當時的歷史背景，政治背景，社會背景，和思想背景等，也一一加以分析。這種科學的研究方法，已值得我們注意，而分析之精詳深刻，允使我們不能不加以一讀的。第二編為「孔子的哲學思想」，這是一個最重要的部門。一般人研究孔子的哲學部份，往往偏重於孔子的人生哲學，政治哲學，和敎育哲學等，對於孔子哲學方法，大多略而不詳。所以造成這種現象，當然為了孔子的哲學方法的部門實在太艱深了。其實，假定不理解孔子的哲學方法，我們便不能接受這大思想家治學為人的最精深的部份，也便是算不得了解孔子，研究孔子的學說。該書對於孔子哲學方法的」項，特別詳加論列。把孔子的一貫，知機，中庸，正名，絜矩的哲學方法的道理，詳為闡述，這一點，我們應該加以鄭重地注意的。第三編為「孔子的不朽事業」，它把孔子政治上的成就，著作上的成就，敎化上的成就，具體列舉，這一編與孔子的生平歷史，互相參閱，更可對孔子得到明晰的認識、第四編為「偉大的孔子」，這一編的內容，完全是說孔子對於後世影響的深刻和久遠，不論政治方面的或社會方面的。所以我們能够把這本單行本細細地閱讀一過，對於孔子已有深刻研究的人們，可以得到互相參證研討之益；對於孔子毫無認識的人們，可以對於孔子得到一個輪廓的大要。</p>
<p>筆者以為該書最值得我們佩服的一點，就是立論非常客觀，一點沒有固執的偏見。這，固然是研究一切學術的根木條件，然而，在今日國人研究孔子的態度而論，是缺少那麼一件寳貝的。　筆者希望中學生們，大學生們，尊孔的大人先生，反孔的前進份子們，大家都來一讀這本「孔子」，要知道盲目的崇解和盲目的反對，在學術同上樣是千古的罪人啊</p>
<p>該書為中華書局出版，實價五角，桃零紙精印，凡一八〇頁，長五萬官。</p>

<h3>白濁白帶是兩性關係的魔障</h3>
<p>— 德國Scblagenhaufer原著　俄國勞働醫科大學畢業楊道南醫師節譯</p>
<p>……夫婦間喪失去幸福非但子嗣難望且無快樂可言　……要掃除淋濁必須依據根本的實益和聽醫師指導</p>
<p>淋病的足跡，已經傳佈了宇宙的每個空間，各個國家，各個階級，到處都充滿了淋病的氣氛，這話並不誇張，我們只要看醫院中淋病數字的劇增，和花柳病院的紛起，都是極好的證明。</p>
<p>凡是一個人患了淋病，無論已婚未婚，對於異性方面每每被剝奪天賦的權利。因為患者如果不去醫好，必致終身抱病，簡直不能夠結婚。倘使有了妻子，而患着淋病，那就不能實行夫婦間的性生活，否則，即將引起為妻的健康上的糾紛，使她發生白帶症，斷送一生的幸福。而且男子患淋病的，攝護腺·睾丸·精囊等，都被淋菌毀損，因此不能生育。婦女子宮·卵巢·輸卵管亦由淋毒作崇而不能受孕。所以要免除這些悲慘事實的來臨，必定要根本求得剷除淋毒的實益，淋毒一除，許多生殖器部分的炎症及合併症的關節炎等，也就絕對一掃而盡。</p>
<p>依據我（原著者）在德國醫科大學研究院的考察，許多有名的教授如Bumm　Weiss等醫師的實騐，確證只有淋病聖藥「克淋儂」，為治淋濁白帶的特效劑。因為這是蛋白體和提凈的色素合製而成。其治淋的特殊功效，早已為全世界醫師所震驚！凡男女患者不論急性施用此藥，而婦女可兼外用「卡而雪地」每晚納入陰道一二片，這是有百利而無一害的。</p>
<h3>發育不全和陰萎是男子的致命傷</h3>
<p>— 楊道南醫師</p>
<p>要怎樣處置才可以增進妻子的快感</p>
<p>凡是健全的男子，他的發育之良好是無疑的。尤以生殖器的發育，為每個健全男子必具的條件。像陰莖，睾丸，攝護腺，精囊等，都能充分發育，這原因就由於體內有一種促進全身和性發育的荷爾蒙液之故。如在少年犯手淫或房事過多，先天不足，荷　爾蒙必然缺乏，發育便不完全，而兩性的性生活，就難以達到美滿。早洩，陰萎，使你陷入最悲慘的地步。對方也就無法享受一切幸福了。</p>
<p>我在俄國勞　醫科大學研究院時，鄰近有許多工人都患着劇烈的手淫，每星期大都有五六次的遺精，有的耳鳴精滑，健忘心悸。有的入夜甚至失眠盜汗。他們很難實行正式性生活，性不發育，陰萎早洩，使他們痛苦異常，離婚的案件，成為家常便飯。經我用梅倫氏的德國「補體康」增加他們的荷爾蒙，以使發育，並根治其性的衰弱症，同時投以「耐而斯遺精片」治其遺精，大多不出六七星期，諸症狀及性的衰弱症與遺精，完全消除，精神旺盛，重獲健全的發育，一切令人極端滿意。這兩藥絕對合乎華人體質，值得介紹。</p>
<h3>一個聰明伶俐女子</h3>
<p>— 南通醫科大學畢業武鐘麟醫師</p>
<p>因了神經衰弱　變成了啼笑無常</p>
<p>我們如果有一副聰明伶俐的天賦，那末到處自然會受人歡迎的。尤其是女子如此，但是本來一個聰明伶俐的女子，因了神經衰弱，月經乖亂等病的結果，就變為愚笨了。而且因卵巢機能的變態，月經不調，艱於嗣育，精神和肉體更受打擊，往往變成一個啼笑無常的歇斯的里症。那時的夫婦之道，更加苦了。他如白帶的下注，也時見於此病。</p>
<p>凡是婦女患了上面各症。據我在南通醫科大學的時候，嘗讀到利斯德，達克資基諸博士的論文，知道以服德國梅倫氏所發明的「補女容」一藥，對於女子月經失調，少腹痛，白帶病，及其他久婚不孕等患，即可使月經趨於調整，故結果遂完成調經催孕之任，稪可使神經趨於正常，仍可恢復一個聰明伶俐的女子，且使肌肉細緻充實，除紋去皺，研態動人。良以「補女容」有使整個內分泌機能旺盛，回復青春時代之狀態。至於白帶病，則除了用此藥為內服劑外，可一方用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」為坐藥，以掃盪可厭的白垢，大概在四星期左右，無不全愈。</p>

<p>……姑息頓挫療法之淘汰——　……昂進細胞抗淋療法之新成功——</p>
<p>科學猛進，醫學亦日進不已：許多古人所認為難治不治之疾患，今日皆藉科學之萬能以解決之。淋病亦其一也。從前一般醫家，對於淋病，向視為難治或不治這症，當其病患發作時，施以姑息療法，為一般人往往惑於局部透膜殺菌之謬說，或用暴劣藥品，以求一時頓挫病勢。結果由急化慢，由輕變重，如睾丸炎，精囊炎，攝護腺炎及漏，以及關節炎，淋毒性狹心症，敗血症等。輕則負痛絕孕，重則生命斷送。</p>
<p>然自彼德氏發明色素與蛋白體混合製劑之「克淋儂」，服後能在短期中使全體起昂進抗淋殺菌效力，心遇有病灶之處，即起喰菌作用。故可迅將全部淋菌蕭清，而「克淋儂」一藥，遂能戰勝任何淋藥，前之以透膜殺菌等為號召之白濁藥，亦完全淘汰矣。余於多年來臨床上之實騐。各期淋病，用「克淋儂」為內服藥，一方伍以X缐電療等法，發揮其殺菌之威力，依此治療，茍患者能知攝生，從夫失敗，不但余之經騐如此，即世界著名醫家，用「克淋儂」而治愈淋病之成績亦然。故能獲得一致之好評。惟妻子亦已被染此病者，除內服「克淋儂」外，一方用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」為坐藥，以滌清白帶，防其　道糜爛，則效用尤著矣。</p>
<h3>破鏡重圓</h3>
<p>— 日本帝國大學醫科畢業陳宗堃醫師</p>
<p>夫妻已失去了愛情，怎樣能給他重新恢復？</p>
<p>破鏡重圓這句話，一向拿來比喻夫妻反目或分離之後，而重復和合的事情。但我們要分析中原因，有許多人以為夫婦的反目或離異，都因為經濟上的關係，其實都沒有了解愛的真相，我們不是時常看到有資產階級的人家，他們為何天天鬧離婚或爭吵呢？這當然不是為錢的問題而是為愛的問題，質言之，他們之中必有一方對於性生活感到不滿足，老實說，維持愛情只有「性慾」二個字，用不着拿道學先生說些吞吞吐吐的話。</p>
<p>者我在東京帝國大學醫科的時候，對於這個問題，感到極大的興趣，孜孜研究不倦，才知道凡是男子在青春發育時代，濫施手淫，或者未屆結婚年齡而遽行早婚，於是正在萌芽發育的青春腺，天天受此種惡魔的剝奪，試問他們還能享受性的正常的幸福麼？所以患了手淫和早婚房事過度的男女，他們下部的發育是畸形的，或渺小如蠶蛾，或彎曲如弓形，而遺精，早洩，勃起力不堅，性的快感減少等異常嚴重的症狀，都接踵而起了。他如精神沈　，心悸亢進，失眠頭痛，記憶力有顯著退減。整個性神經衰弱的症狀都　集於一身。</p>
<p>這種性腺的毀壞，我們應該求徹底的治療，就是改進性腺的組織，德國梅倫博士發明的男用「補體康」，便是對性神經衰弱療法第一個大成功的人。他選擇勇壯動物的荷爾蒙，以科學新方法製成，經過了多次動物試騐成功之後，更研究改為人的內服藥，故「補體康」效力的偉大和耐久，凡是用過「補體康」的醫家和病家都可證明的。此藥既能強化生殖系統，促進性的發育和快感的增加，一切遺精早洩不能勃起等嚴重症狀，自然無形中治愈了。既然獲到了健全的性機能，夫婦的愛情自然山濃厚而如膠漆。但仍須注意，不可濫用「性慾」庶幾體健可維至久遠而不弊。</p>
<h3>生命的活力資源惟一就是飲食</h3>
<p>— 陳少華醫師</p>
<p>健康者需要一個更好的胃臟充實體憊</p>
<p>胃呆和消化不良的人應如何急待解決一種生物缺乏了營養，便不能夠維持生命。同樣，人類的活動能力，完全是靠了食料的營養。黃包車夫和苦工們對于飯的大量攝取，便是一個很好的證例。飯量的大小。視其人勞動（勞心和勞力）的程度為比牽。失了一定的限度就會使人營養不良，貧血，衰弱，所以在講究衛生的歐洲人，認定「強胃精」是家族必備之品。因為牠能強大食慾。</p>
<p>健康人如此，有胃病的人就更該設法治愈。我們看那些胃病患者，終年不能暢快的吃點東西，不是食後作痛，便是膨脹難受，平日噎逆噯氣。酸水嘔噁。痛苦重重，談虎色變。普通製劑都沒有治這些症候的能力！只有「強胃精」能兼籌並顧。國內外醫科大學畢業的醫師完全證明了它的實效。對於消化不良的口臭口苦，腹痛腸鳴，大便秘結，下痢清水等，都有對症治療的無上功績。</p>
<h3>遺精與滑精</h3>
<p>— 陳宗堃醫師</p>
<p>夢中快樂醒來愁　青年人的危機</p>
<p>要想做一個健全的國民，希望將來立身社會，做一番大事業的青年，第一不可不注意他的體格，是否可担得起這責任。真的，現在青年，他們十九都有犯手淫的惡習，天天把可貴的荷爾蒙浪費，以致未老先衰，其主要的病狀，為艷夢多端，醒來即覺不樂，其遺精，漸進而為滑精—見色流精，精液漏，身體天天的瘦下來，面色黃如桅蠟，唇爪無華呈極度的貧血。不及早治療，則勃起中樞神經，射精中樞神經都失去他們的作用，快感的神經也因麻痺而失去了。這，我們都應該去分析處理他。絕對不可用霸烈的藥物，以快一時之意。</p>
<p>「耐而斯遺精片」，善能鎮攝神經的虛性興奮，鞏固精管，澄清慾念而戒除手淫的惡癖，所以服此片後，即可在數星期中治愈了。但是遺精久了，荷爾蒙有大量的損失，失眠健忘心悸等，可與「補體康」同時服用。更有雙管齊下，相得益彰之妙了。</p>
<p>紅樓夢斷片研究</p>
<h3>林黛玉肺結核的研究</h3>
<p>— 前南洋醫科大學教授鄧源和醫師</p>
<p>……善病工愁三朝兩病急壞了寶哥哥！　……林妹妹從小得着「小癆病」何以會長到十六歲？</p>
<p>「癆病百問」之Ⅱ</p>
<p>本刋兩期以前曾談到賈寶玉的丫頭晴雯害「女兒癆」死去的一節，開于癆病的描述，紅樓夢的著者曹雪芹真能走到鬼斧神工的一步了。尤其是林黛玉的癆病，讀之令人如親身目擊。我們現在要問：林妹妹從小得了癆病，所以她善病工愁；但三日一　，五日一兩的，為什麼會得長大到十六七歲時才死呢？這是一個大足注意的問題。記得我在南為醫科大學教書時，課後常把這些問題和學生討論。我以為我們雖不必像賈寶玉那樣耽心，可是從醫學的立場來說，林妹妹的病確可供療養肺病者的研究。她所以能一直長大到十六七歲，就因為她沒有過分的勞動，而且平日多半躺臥。住室四週又是空曠的花園，空氣新鮮，故能抗戰癆虫，延長殘餘的生命。可惜因無特效藥而結果仍是死了。</p>
<p>因此，一切害肺癆的男女病人，應該首先尋取肺病特效藥來根治它。僅憑療養實不中用。一九二六美國肺病專家葛萊夫金氏曾加以肯定，證明肺癆如吐血潮熱，盜汗咳嗽。胸痛欬痰等，只有絕對餌服「補肺拿爾」這種特效藥，便可在八九個星期的短時間內，把癆菌包圍起來，獲得迅速治愈。至於男肺病人的早洩陰萎，腰痛，可兼服「補體康」。遺精可服「耐而斯遺精片」。女病人的月經不調，經痛經閉，可服「補女容」。體虛白帶可外用「卡而雪地」而「補體康」「補女容」又能治愈兩性肺病人的腦弱失眠呢！</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>「亞化西流」！</h3>
<p>— 無次</p>
<p>『亞化西流！』</p>
<p>無綠無故地寫上這四個字，讀者大的也會感到奇突。但幷不眞的沒來由：有三位女畫家為了『宣揚我國美化（不是文化）』，呈請敎育部補助津貼，現在已蒙批淮。批准之後，本來就可以束裝就道實行『宣揚』了。但據說那篇呈文，『駢四儷六，情文幷佳』有刋登之必要；我於拜讀之餘，特再在這裏節錄數段，以示景仰之意云爾：</p>
<p>『伏念某等才非道韞，學世界之交界之交通，促藝林之進步，歐風久經東漸，亞化自可西流，本宗元法之正宗，作歐美折衷之定見，茫茫墜緒，恐負荷之弗勝，小小年華，望前程之遠大……日成功歸國，春暉報寸草之心，此時載筆放洋，德化被甘棠之蔭……』</p>
<p>從頭到尾，把這篇『情文幷茂』的大文一口氣讀下來，果然鏗鏘入耳，情見乎詞，大有繞樑三日之槪。不過『才非道韞』也吧，『值世界之交通』也吧，『小小年華』也吧，唯有這『亞化自可西流』，却大有斟酌之必要。</p>
<p>為什麼呢？</p>
<p>這裏首先應該被考慮的，就是什麼是『亞化』了。假如『亞化』就是『亞洲的文化』的縮寫，看來中國的文化這一次是要代表亞洲無疑。不管人家承認不承認，但我們也該照照鏡子，除了古代以外，近代的中國文化到底是什麼呢？倘然沒有什磨，那麼這『西流』呌它怎樣『流』法？假如『亞化』幷不當作『亞洲的文化』而祗作為「亞洲化』解，如『具體化』，『明朗化』等，這『化』字大有動詞Nze的意味，那麼就是要呌西方人變成『亞洲化』或者『亞洲的中國化，』呌他們丟了飛機輪船不坐，來改坐中國的帆船和牛車，呌他們撇了電燈自來水不用，而改點眞正中國型的『燈盞』，改到古井裏去波水：呌他們無綫電報不打，電影不看，而改用中國的「驛使」，和到祠堂裏去看草台斑：呌他們男子都養起髮來打一根辮子，呌他們女人脫去高跟鞋，而用裏脚帶將六寸圓膚裏成三寸金蓮。</p>
<p>老實說吧，現代的中國文化，早已經不是國產的了，我們應該承認自己的不長進，而虛心地去接受下來，也許能够「迎頭趕上去。」如果仍舊抱着「蠻夷」與「華夏」的成見，以為中國文化閒發最早，任憑人家怎樣進步，都是不足道的，充其極，必要弄到文化解體而后止。</p>
<p>卽以藝事來說吧，我不知道中國畫有些什麼值得到外國去『官揚』，又有些什麼能够代表『亞化』而『西流』？幾百年以前的古人，畫的山水，岩石，茅屋，水牛，牧童，花草，在現代人的筆底也仍舊是那磨一套，而且還要傲然地題上「倣宋元筆意」之類的東西，使外人見了，以為中國還停留在十五六世紀那個不知有世界的時代，中國是一個落後的國家，中華民族是一個最不長進的民族。</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>這簡直是『出乖露醜』而不是『宣揚』了。</p>
<p>既然是『小小年華』而且『前程遠大』，那麽就虚心地在國外研究研究，『宣揚』我想不必費心，而『西流』更是萬萬『流』不得的。</p>
<h3>鄉長</h3>
<p>— 士希</p>
<p>在記憶里，使我印象最深刻的人，有兩個：一個就是王子成，再一個是王保董。</p>
<p>王子成是一個三十四五年紀的人，身材瘦瘦高約四尺多長，身上常常穿着一件白灰色竹布長衫，足上常穿雙綫耳草鞋，（綫和竹麻編成的），不管晴天雨天，照常是那雙草鞋，要到舊歷年終才看見他換的。</p>
<p>在村里他是壯丁隊的長官，官架子打得十足，可是他對我底母親却像是自家人。他和王保董是死對頭，為什麼呢？他自己也說不出，但是對母親說話時，一開口却就憤憤的罵起來！</p>
<p>「他媽的，什磨狗屁王保董就喊王金登算了。」接下，又用憤慨的聲音訴說他底罪惡了：他底心比媒炭還黑，收了公欵，繳上區公所去，最少要侵吞一半，還說是無私。整天事情也不幹，要不是，他造大屋子，買皮大衫的錢那兒來？……」</p>
<p>他底氣發得够了，末後便萬分細心地可嚀道：</p>
<p>一老太太這些話只有你我兩人知道就算了，不要說出口去，我跟他，王保董也是無寃無仇的。……」</p>
<p>王保董，他也和王子成一樣，常到我們家里來和母親談話，洗白他底心。在暗中，他雖不知道王子成說他什麼壞話，但是他却害怕他會奪去他底鄉長地位的。他說話時滿面笑容，口里就老太太長老太太短的呌。有時他就無原無故生氣地呌道：</p>
<p>「王子成那個狗心腸的，他抬私包子不知道有多少决，挑私鹽和牛犯（偷關稅）都和他有來往。有時和着那些門戶連（四川呌壯丁隊）在晚上說是去放步哨，暗中却偷去「摸夜螺絲」搶那些富農和小地主。……」</p>
<p>有時他們互相在我們屋里碰在一塊了，兩方面都滿面排着笑，互說了好話，客氣得像兄弟樣，母親常說他們只是一時的意氣，過些日子就好了。</p>
<p>但在背後，他們又互相說着壞話，拍着胸膛訴說對方的罪孽。</p>
<p>有一天，我們送母親回城，正在為着一件小事談得興奮，忽聽得背後有喊呌聲，回過一看，見王保董，他也正要上城去，他大聲呌着：</p>
<p>「老太太你坐得起轎子不坐，那些抬轎夫從過（怎樣意）生活下去？又附近低着說：「王子成那狗心腸昨晚又鬧事了，他以為牛犯子牽着牛從他底壩子邊一過，我不知道嗎？」</p>
<p>說罷笑了笑便長揚去了。</p>
<p>走沒好遠，我們便碰到王子成了，他正從外村趕得來，面孔非常難看，盛氣地訴說着道：</p>
<p>「王金登那王八，在外面說我壞話，老太太如果你聽到就請別去信他。」</p>
<p>晚上八點鐘，大家正吃完晚飯，長工們都洗着手脚預備去睡覺，太安大叔他是一個抽大烟的人，正躺在床上吞烟吐霧的抽着，我們都圍在他旁邊。在田路上有馬燈照亮在我們底大門壁上，有人低聲的說道：「王保董回來了。……」</p>
<p>可是過不了多久，我們便聽見了一陳喊救聲從遠遠飛丟着過來，大家都驚愕着，長工們，從睡里驚醒了，抓牢了傢伙趕出去，，連抽搭烟的大叔也丟下烟槍跑去看。</p>
<p>在一堆血泊中王保董就躺着，他已經昏失得不知人事了。在遠遠王子成也帶了幾個壯丁隊趕着過來，他邊呌人把屍首抬走，邊咽聲咽氣的對着熟鬧的人呌道：</p>
<p>「你們父老兄弟，我們底王保董被人暗算了，這是我們村里的不幸，也是兄弟的不幸，因為我失去了一枝有力的助手……」</p>
<p>說吧他底眼淚滴下了，大家都搖着頭，說王子成是一個好人。</p>
<p>不久他被人選作鄉長了。</p>
<h3>名勝之區</h3>
<p>— 胡慰雄</p>
<p>回到鄉下的第二天，幾個的着的朋友都乘頭斑車到我家裏來。故鄉在歷史上是很有地位的，近來公路通行之後，從上海來遊覽，當天好打來回，方是這小小的縣城居然也像其他名勝之區一樣地常常有闊老們來光顧了。</p>
<p>自己因為職務關係，要年難得有幾天回到鄉下，而且每决都是來去忽忽，黃包車在街道上拉過的時候，祗覺得故鄉的商店也學會了上海大减價的一套，紮彩牌樓，僱吹鼓手，其他就看不出這縣城變為名勝之區的理由了。</p>
<p>朋友們却有這樣一個要求，要我嚮導他們遊覽一番。這對於我眞是個難題目，自已進中學讀書就離開了故鄉，算起來已經有十年光量了；故鄉卽是有什磨名勝，我應該也是被嚮導的一個了。所以每次我都拒絕了：</p>

<p>但是他們總沒有絕望，此次我因為有事回到鄉下，他們馬上結隊來了。我立卽去找了堂吹來，他自然比我知道得多些。上午我們遊行了街道一周，所看到的是大減價，彩牌樓，像其他的縣城一樣，到處鬧着不景氣。我想拿這個理由來希望他們和我搭午車返上海，他們却要求堂兄弟和他們去參觀××園，孔廟，校塲，甚至想到附近的×山×峯去遊個暢快。這些名勝之區在我的記憶裏早已模糊了，他們彷彿本地人一樣背得滾瓜爛熟。在地主之誼的我到這時候也無拒絕了。由堂兄弟的引導，飯後我們先到××園。</p>
<p>××園是故鄉的一個私人花園，我祖父在的時候，我曾經跟着去過一次，但是那花園是什麼模樣，現在是怎樣也記不起來了。黃包車拉過了一條僅能通過一輛車身的小街，就儘在曲折的小巷里兜着，我幾乎懷疑我們的車子已經離這小縣城了，一個本地人怎樣沒有到過這地方呢。又兜過了一條狹小的街，才瞧了××園的一方匾額掛在一所廟宇式的大門前，金底黑字，在太陽光底下閃閃作光，看來還是新近掛上去的吧？</p>
<p>走過二進屋子，眞像廟宇一樣，靜悄悄地沒有一個人。轉過走廊，有一個月洞門，上面寫「曲徑通幽」，才聽見裏面有喧鬧的聲音。我正回想我跟祖父來的時候是不是這個地方，我們已經到了四面廳了。廳的前面有一個荷花池子。這池子却在我腦海裏留着，我曾吃過這池子裏的兩個蓮蓬。現在荷葉都已枯黃了，祗有浮在水面的還有幾張綠葉，不過那樣小，所謂留得殘荷聽雨聲，這樣的小葉子是不中用的，何况它浮在水面，雨的在上面等於落在池子裏一样。</p>
<p>四面應好像也是新近修理的，有匾額，有屏條，有匟几，中央陳設了幾張小圓台和藤椅，預備遊客們到了這裏品茗賞荷用的。現在雖然沒有荷花可賞，而且邊門貼着一張「內係住宅，遊客止步」，這名勝的××園旣已一覽無餘，自然也得坐下來歇歇了。</p>
<p>「如何？」我開始向朋友們發問。</p>
<p>不到黃河心不死。一個回答我：「總比得意樓喝茶風雅些。」</p>
<p>大家微笑着，失望了的樣子。</p>
<p>遊客到是很多，也有西賓，因為那天是星期日，坐自備汽車來恐怕不在少數吧。</p>
<p>我們每人泡了一壺茶，沒有坐到十分鐘光景，他們都想走了。不過意見並不一致，有的再想去看看孔廟校塲，有的也附議我乘三點半的車子返上海了。</p>
<p>堂兄付了茶博士一塊錢，那個老實的鄉下人扮着笑臉說再要一塊。我們一共是五個人，五壺茶要二塊錢，我笑着說：</p>
<p>「這不是跳舞塲裏的價錢嗎？」</p>
<p>「今朝禮拜，請再賞賜一點」茶博士又笑着開口了。</p>
<p>堂兄向他揮揮手。「我們都是本地人，別打秋風了，一塊還是客氣的呢？」</p>
<p>他聽了堂兄的本鄉話同，才謝着走開了。</p>
<p>「好罷」。在踏出××園門口時候，我對他們說；「不是有綫人沒有地方化錢，才到這裏做冤大頭！」</p>

<p>中秋月</p>
<p>是的，「中秋月」是分外的明媚有綫的人家在這個分外明媚的中秋月夜裏，在狂歡的喝着酒，跳着版，唱着歌，和咀嚼着應時的月餅兒，悠幽地講着聽着「唐明皇的軼事。」可是這祗是屬於有綫人賞樂的節日啊！</p>
<p>然而，我們窮人家呢？這分外明的月光是投照片不進我們鴿籠也似的草棚或者是矮屋的。草棚和矮屋裏有的是：飢餓侵蝕得消瘦的面容；空着肚子啼哭的孩子；床上呻吟沒錢吃藥的病人；上門討債的兇狠的眼睛；迫着人家走上死路去！</p>
<p>岳子林的一家就給追上滅亡的路了。—在「中秋月」分外明的時候。</p>
<p>岳子林從前也有過十來萬的家私，因為經過一陣陣的襲擊，終　保不住這十來萬的財富而破產而淪落了。然而十來萬財富固有生活習慣使他在淪落下來的現在還改變不了他的固執。他死要面子，他是不願意他的第二人個女兒—阿榮（卽妹妹）去給人家當使女的；但是一家六口子的食　，都重壓在她姐姐—大女兒的身上，靠做工來養活是擔當不下的。</p>
<p>阿荣是一個天眞無邪的小姑娘，因為生得美麗，却給主人家的少爺胡信美騙上了</p>
<p>知道這是一種騙欺啊。正是：「他玩厭了那些小姐們，現在要拿我們窮人開心了！」</p>
<p>「你年紀還輕，不會懂得的，可是你要知道他們就是眞喜歡你，過不幾時也就要忘記了…」她的姐姐說得對。她的姐姐是個新的女性，她在做着婦女大眾的解放運動在向主子們交涉着提高待遇的事。因此她們工作的廠正停着工。可是她們為了生活，妹妹又被騙遺棄，她們的母親遭受了重重刺激，先主母害了三四二個妹妹，而自己也自殺了。</p>
<p>妹妹是瘋狂的跑了出去。姐姐呢？她是去領導着大眾們反抗那些殘忍的主子們！</p>
<p>父親追趕不着她們倆，失望的回來。「你一個人活着幹嗎呢？」唉！都死了。</p>
<p>總之，這樣的事在都市裏在層層的發生着；可是，那些孩子是無辜的。太殘酷了！</p>
<p>救救孩子吧！</p>

<h3>Kawagoe Visits Foreign Minister Zhang to Continue Negotiations on the Chengdu Incident. Zhang Expresses Views on Suppressing Anti-Japanese Sentiment. Both Sides Exchange Opinions on General National Relations Adjustment Issues.</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe visited Foreign Minister Zhang at 3:30 PM on the 23rd to continue discussions on the Chengdu Incident. Mr. Zhang first explained the measures the National Government was considering to resolve the Chengdu Incident and expressed various views on suppressing the anti-Japanese movement. Subsequently, they exchanged opinions on general adjustments to Sino-Japanese national relations, until 7:00 PM when Kawagoe departed, totaling a meeting of three and a half hours. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Japanese Embassy Counselor Wakasugi, accompanied by Secretary Ogihara, arrived in Nanjing by China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane at 9:00 AM on the 23rd and immediately went to the Japanese Embassy to report to Kawagoe and present their statements. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to reporters' inquiries, the third meeting between Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe and Foreign Minister Zhang on the 23rd included, on the Chinese side, in addition to Foreign Minister Zhang, Gao Zongwu, Director of the Asian Affairs Department, Zhou Longxiang, a specialist in the Asian Affairs Department's Research Office, and Shao Yulin, Chief of the Japanese-Soviet Section of the Intelligence Department. On the Japanese side were Ambassador Kawagoe and Secretaries Suma and Shimizu. Zhou Longxiang and Shimizu took separate notes for each side. The talks began at 3:30 PM and concluded at 7:00 PM. It is reported that Foreign Minister Zhang, throughout the meeting, adopted a frank and sincere attitude, frankly conveying the Chinese side's views on general issues between China and Japan. (23rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Beihai Investigation Commences Yesterday. Nakamura Visits Diao Zuqian Without Raising Any Demands.</h3>

The 159th Division of the Fourth Route Army, under Tan Ta, immediately departed from Gongguan to take over the defense at noon. Ling Shifen also received a telegram from the Fourth Route Army Headquarters on the afternoon of the 22nd and briefly disembarked from the Fuan warship to inspect the situation in the area, and visited Xu Rangxuan, Chief of Staff of Tan's unit, and local gentry before returning to the ship. He telegraphed Commissioner Diao to report on his landing. As of 8:00 PM on the 23rd, the Liangguang Diplomatic Commissioner's Office had not received any reports on new developments in the area. (23rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Wang Shouting Arrives in Fujian</h3>
<p>(Fuzhou) Training Fleet Commander Wang Shouting led the various warships from the "Four Rivers" and "Six Chu" regions from Hong Kong to Fujian today. They will rest for a day or two before sailing to Nanjing. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>

All garrison units must participate. The exercises will take place from October 25th to early November. While the entire garrison, except for the rear echelon, will participate, the number of troops will certainly not be the exaggerated six or seven thousand as rumored. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Students from the Tianjin Japanese Middle School have formed a volunteer corps and are receiving additional military training, instructed by Major Iwamoto and Instructor Araki attached to the garrison headquarters. The garrison headquarters has issued eight machine guns, three hundred rifles, and several dozen pistols for their use. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Hankou Yoshioka Case: Key Foreign Witness Obtained, Proving Victim Was Shot on Duty. No One in Blue Uniforms Seen. Morishima Meets with Miura to Discuss Everything. Seven Japanese Warships Have Arrived in Hankou.</h3>
<p>(Hankou) Morishima, First Secretary of the Japanese Embassy, arrived in Hankou by CNAC plane from Nanjing on the 23rd to investigate the Yoshioka incident. He met with Japanese Consul Miura to inquire about the discussions with Yang Yongtai and telegraphed the Japanese Embassy. The incident occurred within the Japanese Concession, and any aspect can prove this. The Japanese side suspects it occurred on a Chinese street and claims the perpetrator was wearing blue clothing, based on the statement of an eight-year-old, ignorant vendor, which is very unreliable. Our officials have assisted in the investigation to the best of their ability and have identified a highly relevant foreign witness. We requested that the Japanese send personnel to the witness's consulate to inquire about everything in person, but the Japanese did not send anyone to attend. Subsequently, the municipal government requested they set a time themselves, but no definite answer was received, only that they would not have time in the next few days. Currently, our officials should still proceed with the investigation alone, in accordance with the principle of assistance, in order to clarify the truth. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The foreign witness in the Yoshioka case is from a Northern European country. The eyewitness account they provided has greatly advanced the investigation of this case. It is claimed that at the time of the incident, they were sitting in a rickshaw on He Street in the Japanese Concession, near the Meifu Wharf, only six or seven zhang from the post. They suddenly heard two gunshots and saw Yoshioka fall to the side of the post. They did not see anyone wearing blue clothing. This proves that the body was never moved and that the perpetrator must have come from Dazheng Street within the Japanese Concession. This record has reportedly been sent to the Japanese side for their attention. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Morishima, a secretary of the Japanese Embassy, conferred with Miura and Shirai on the 23rd to discuss the progress of negotiations. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Morishima Morito, First Secretary of the Japanese Embassy, arrived in Hankou by CNAC plane from Nanjing at 11:00 AM on the 23rd. Usui, the Japanese Vice-Consul in Hankou, welcomed him at the airport. It is reported that Morishima came to meet with Consul General Miura to inquire about the details of the Yoshioka incident and the discussions between Miura and Yang Yongtai. (23rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Captain and Mrs. Qiao Qinsheng, two Westerners, happened to be boarding the "Meifu" steamer, which was docked at the Bund here last Saturday morning. They have now been appointed as witnesses in the Sino-Japanese joint investigation of the Yoshioka murder case. It is reported that the Qiaos heard gunshots at the time and witnessed the body of the murdered Japanese policeman lying on the ground. Their testimony may be a crucial factor in the dispute between China and Japan over the location of the crime and the circumstances at the time. The Japanese side insists that Yoshioka was murdered in Chinese territory and moved several yards into the Japanese Concession. However, the Chinese side claims that the entire area is under Japanese jurisdiction, and that the Japanese claimed in 1928 that the area belonged to the Japanese Concession. Chinese and Japanese authorities have held repeated meetings, all of which have focused on this point. The most important meeting was yesterday's meeting between Governor Yang Yongtai of Hubei and Japanese Consul General Miura. It is reported that Qiao's testimony has refuted the rumor that Yoshioka's murderer escaped in a cargo truck after the incident. It appears that the murderer disappeared into the crowd standing nearby. It is even said that the murderer escaped by civilian boat, which seems illogical. Since yesterday, after two Japanese destroyers carrying a batch of marines arrived in Hankou from Shanghai, there are now seven Japanese warships stationed here, shining searchlights on the Bund outside the Japanese Concession every night. (23rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) According to the Daoxun News Agency, Chinese authorities have identified a highly relevant eyewitness in the case of the shooting of Japanese policeman Yoshioka, a foreigner (from a Northern European country). At the time of the incident, this person was sitting in a rickshaw traveling on He Street in the Japanese Concession towards the Meifu Wharf. About six or seven zhang away from Yoshioka's post, they suddenly heard two gunshots and saw Yoshioka fall beside his post (i.e., where the body was found, also known as the "security area" within the concession in Japanese newspapers). After the incident, the rickshaw continued, passing by the body. Only a child and an elderly vendor were seen running away in fear towards the lower part of He Street upon hearing the gunshots. No one wearing blue clothing was seen. This testimony is extremely important because it completely proves that the body was never moved and that the assassin must have launched the attack from Dazheng Street within the Japanese Concession, and escaped back via Dazheng Street or towards the interior of the Japanese Concession after the attack. Due to the importance of this witness, the Chinese side specifically requested the Japanese side to send personnel to the witness's consulate at 2:30 PM on the 23rd to jointly inquire about everything. However, the Japanese side declined to attend at the appointed time, so the Chinese side could only conduct the inquiry alone. (23rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Part of the 29th Army Moves to Nanyuan. Matsumuro Goes to Beiping to Meet Xu Changlin. The Hebei-Chahar-Suiyuan Headquarters Issues a Notice Prohibiting Rumor-Mongering.</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The military affairs in Fengtai were completely resolved on the 23rd. A battalion of the 29th Army's replacement troops moved to Nanyuan in Beiping on the morning of the 23rd. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>

This morning, two companies stationed in Zhao Jia Zhuang were ordered to move to Nanyuan, and the battalion headquarters also moved to Nanyuan. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Soldiers of the 37th Division of the 29th Army are still stationed at the barracks at Fengtai Station. The rumor that they have all withdrawn is inaccurate. As there are unresolved issues, Matsumuro returned to Beiping to discuss with Xu Changlin, Deputy Commander of Feng Zhi'an's security forces. Matsumuro had already returned to Beiping by the morning of the 23rd. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the Fengtai incident was resolved, Matsumuro did not make any proposals to the Chinese side. Rumors are inaccurate. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Matsumuro came to Tianjin to report to Tashiro. After completing his business, he returned to Beiping on the morning of the 23rd. (23rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Hebei-Chahar-Suiyuan Headquarters issued a notice on the 23rd against spreading rumors. Those who fabricate rumors or believe in hearsay will be severely punished. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Second Battalion of the 37th Division stationed in Zhao Jia Zhuang, south of Fengtai, has recently been ordered to move to Xiyuan. The defense of the area they vacated will be taken over by troops from the 38th Division. (23rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Certain Parties Active. Prince De Adopts a Passive Attitude. Eight Thousand Mongolian Soldiers Arrive at Jiabu Temple.</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Prince De is currently stationed at Jiabu Temple. Certain parties are still very active. Prince De's response is currently passive. Eight thousand newly recruited Mongolian soldiers have also arrived at Jiabu Temple. Wang Ying's bandit gang is gradually losing favor with certain parties.

<p>(Kaifeng) Dozens of journalists from the Kaifeng News agency recently submitted a petition to the National Election Headquarters, requesting the suspension of the election of representatives for the entire body of news journalists and proposing an alternative remedy to conform to public opinion. They stated that the situation in the Chinese journalism world is complex, and most journalists in various regions are engaged in their profession independently, without any proper organization, let alone legal entities. If, according to Article 19 of the National Assembly Representative Election Law, occupational groups and freelance professional groups participating in the election are limited to those legally established before the promulgation of this law, then it will be almost impossible for news journalist groups to produce representatives. Even if they are reluctantly produced, they will inevitably be manipulated by a minority, violating the public opinion of the majority of journalists and contravening the original intention of the central government's legislation. The impact in the future is difficult to predict. Considering the significance of this national representative election and the difficulty of implementing the election law in the journalism world, they dare to explain the reasons and earnestly request the commission to understand the situation and approve the temporary suspension of the election of representatives of news journalist groups, and to formulate alternative measures to remedy the situation.

<h3>Regional Pacts and the Issue of Far Eastern Security</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>Since the opening of the League of Nations General Assembly, China has the possibility of being elected as a semi-permanent member of the Executive Council. The people of the country are once again keenly interested in the Geneva peace organization. Hopes for alleviating the Far Eastern crisis with international peace forces have once again increased. In the past, the League of Nations Executive Council lacked representatives from Far Eastern countries, and therefore had a cold attitude toward Asian affairs. Now, the General Assembly's concern for China's demands allows the most important country in Asia to regularly participate with major European powers such as Great Britain, the Soviet Union, Italy, and France, in discussing various global issues. This will undoubtedly be beneficial to Far Eastern security. However, at the time when China is elected to the Executive Council, the League of Nations' prestige is waning. The idea of replacing collective security with regional pacts is gaining momentum. To what extent will the League of Nations' activities contribute to peace in East Asia thereafter?</p>
<p>Collective security and regional pacts differ in nature. Under the principle of collective security, aggression by one country makes it an enemy of the entire world. All League of Nations member states bear equal obligations to impose sanctions. As the League of Nations Charter states, war or the threat of war concerns the well-being of all. Regional security systems require countries within a defined region to jointly maintain security and sanction aggression, while countries outside the region do not intervene. The Locarno Treaties are a clear example of a regional security pact. Their scope extends only to the five countries of Great Britain, France, Italy, Germany, and Belgium near the Rhine River, and the protected area is limited to the border between Germany, France, and Belgium. If the League of Nations Charter is amended to replace the provisions of Articles 10 to 17 with the Locarno model, then Europe would become a regional security unit, and East Asia would also become a regional security unit. In the current situation, the driving force of the League of Nations lies with Great Britain and France. The area of concern for Great Britain and France is the Rhine River region. They have neither the time nor the ability to deal with Far Eastern affairs. Even if the League of Nations can strive for peace in the future, there will inevitably be distinctions between urgency and priority.</p>
<p>Moreover, there are major obstacles to the League of Nations promoting a regional security system in the Far East. The main actors in the Far Eastern problem are Japan, the Soviet Union, Great Britain, the United States, and China. China's national strength is too weak, and it is often in a passive position. Among the four powers, Japan and the United States are not members of the League of Nations, which differs greatly from the fact that only Germany among the five Locarno countries is outside the League of Nations. In the past, the Four-Power Treaty was signed at the Washington Conference, in which Great Britain, the United States, Japan, and France agreed to maintain the status quo in the Pacific and respect the security of each other's territories and possessions. If there was aggression, they would discuss how to respond. These provisions are similar in nature to a regional security agreement. However, although there were provisions for consultation in the Washington Treaty, these clauses were not implemented after the September 18th Incident. In the current situation, it is unlikely that Japan would be willing to sign a treaty of the same nature. It is also difficult for the United States to join a Far Eastern regional security pact initiated by the League of Nations and assume greater sanction obligations. The prospect of security is very slim.</p>
<p>The League of Nations cannot resolve European problems, and Great Britain, France, and other countries are eagerly seeking partial peace in Western Europe. If we want the security of the Far East to be guaranteed, we should not place excessive hopes on the League of Nations.</p>
<h3>Belicza Visits Zhang Zizhong to Discuss Anti-Smuggling Affairs in the Suburbs of Tianjin. Zhang Agrees to Dispatch Military Police to Provide Substantial Assistance. Sun Weidong Goes to Beiping to Visit Li Qingxuan to Discuss the Issue of Clearing Smuggled Goods.</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) At 10:00 AM on the 23rd, Belicza, accompanied by Xu Liya, Customs Commissioner of Tianjin, visited Zhang Zizhong at the municipal government to discuss the substantial assistance from military police agencies in anti-smuggling in the suburbs of Tianjin. Zhang has agreed, but the Customs must propose a method to the municipal government, which will then discuss it with various agencies. Xu excused himself during the discussion. Afterward, Belicza and Xu went to the Sanfenka in the suburbs to inspect the situation. They originally planned to visit Song Zheyuan in the afternoon, but because Song was busy, the visit was changed to the morning of the 24th. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The matter of anti-smuggling in North China and the Hebei-Chahar Chief Inspectorate will continue to be discussed in Beiping. Sun Weidong and Ge Dingyuan went to Beiping on the 23rd to continue discussions with Guo Zhihan, Qin Dechun, and Li Qingxuan. When Li Qingxuan was in Tianjin, he telegraphed Kong and suggested two compromise policies: 1. Limit the policy to smuggled goods already stockpiled in Tianjin, register them with the Customs, and release them without fines. 2. If it is necessary to change the inspection and release procedures, the fee must be at least one-quarter of the customs duty. The Ministry of Finance has not responded, and the Hebei-Chahar authorities also fear that this method will be difficult to implement diplomatically. Therefore, a new approach must be discussed in Beiping. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Sun Weidong, Superintendent of the Tianjin Customs, and Ge Dingyuan, Secretary-General of the Political Affairs Committee, went to Beiping from Tianjin on the morning of the 23rd.

<p>(Tianjin) The Cang County Branch of the Hebei-Chahar Chief Inspectorate cracked a batch of smuggled sugar that landed from Qikou on the 22nd. The total value is more than 10,000 yuan, and it will be transported to Tianjin for auction. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) With regard to Hebei-Chahar's plan to establish an Inspectorate, the Ministry of Finance, based on the principles of maintaining the integrity and unity of customs duties and the customs anti-smuggling organization, and of not reducing taxes to protect the interests of legitimate merchants, instructed Li Qingxuan to go to negotiate. The solution is still under discussion. However, recently, the Ximen Branch of the Tianjin Customs has been impersonating the name of the Inspectorate, colluding with Korean ronin to transport smuggled goods to Gaoyang and other areas near Beiping. There have been three major shipments: the first shipment consisted of rayon, with 45 trucks; the second shipment consisted of silk fabrics and sugar, with 52 trucks; and the third shipment consisted of 20 trucks. All claimed to have obtained permission and forcibly transported the goods. Therefore, smuggled goods have recently become active again in Beiping and Tianjin. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Portugal Proposes Conditions for Participating in the Adjustment Committee; Foreign Minister of Spain Plans to Protest Neutrality Violations and Arms Supplies</h3>
<p>(Geneva) After British Foreign Secretary Eden discussed with the Portuguese Foreign Minister this afternoon, British officials revealed that Portugal had accepted to participate in the Adjustment Committee for non-intervention in the Spanish civil war, but proposed multiple conditions. For example, since the Soviet Union is included in the Adjustment Committee, Portugal cannot allow the Adjustment Committee to have the power to control affairs within Portuguese territory.</p>
<p>(Lisbon) Regarding the issue of participating in the Adjustment Committee, there have been many rumors since Portugal proposed conditions. Prime Minister Salazar recently issued a statement to the newspapers, stating that Portugal will faithfully fulfill its obligations under the non-intervention agreement in the Spanish civil war. However, it is unwilling to give up all of its colonies and naval bases, and its foreign policy is not contrary to that of Great Britain. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) According to today's morning newspapers, the Spanish representative to the League of Nations, Foreign Minister Álvarez del Vayo, will send a note to the Great Powers in Geneva opposing Portugal's violation of neutrality. It is reported that the note will list the facts of Portugal's supply of arms to the Spanish rebels. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>The League of Nations Seeks to Restore Authority; Strives for Connections with the Americas; Tries to Harmonize Three International Conventions; Remarks by the President of the Assembly Reveal Clues; The Issue of Abyssinian Representation Is Put to the Vote at the Assembly</h3>
<p>(Geneva) French Foreign Minister Delbos held talks with Argentine Foreign Minister Lamas (the current President of the League of Nations Assembly) today. Lamas declared that he is very willing to do his best to work to harmonize the Covenant of the League of Nations, the Saavedra Lamas Anti-War Treaty, and the Briand-Kellogg Pact. (Note: The Saavedra Lamas Anti-War Treaty, also known as the "Treaty on Non-Aggression and Conciliation Between American States," was initiated by Argentine Foreign Minister Saavedra Lamas and signed in the Argentine capital on October 10, 1933. The Briand-Kellogg Pact, also known as the Pact of Paris or the Kellogg-Briand Pact, was initiated by the late French Foreign Minister Briand and former US Secretary of State Kellogg and signed in Paris on August 27, 1928). In addition, Lamas said that Argentina hopes to develop economic and cultural relations with France and, through France's mediation, develop economic and cultural relations with European countries. Delbos replied that he expressed his deep sympathy for Lamas's plan and would do his best to seek closer ties between France and Argentina. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Credentials Committee of the League of Nations Assembly held a closed meeting at 10:30 this morning to continue discussing the issue of Abyssinia's representative attending the Assembly. The chairman was Peruvian representative Tudela. The meeting adjourned at 1:05 PM and was scheduled to resume at 4:30 PM. It is generally believed that the committee will submit recommendations to the Assembly and allow it to choose freely. It is expected that the issue can be resolved when the Assembly meets at 6:30 PM this afternoon. Informed sources believe that if the Assembly decides to refer the case to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for a decision, Italy will definitely issue a statement that it will disregard all work of the League of Nations, but will not formally withdraw from the League of Nations at this time. (Havas dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Disarmament Negotiations; Possible Resumption in Geneva; Britain Is Willing to Voice Support for France</h3>
<p>(Paris) When well-informed sources mentioned the possibility of resuming arms limitation negotiations in Geneva today, they all said that France did not want to submit a concrete disarmament plan to the League of Nations. The French government may issue a declaration on disarmament, but it will not contain concrete suggestions. This statement was made because the Paris correspondent of The Times of London had reported that disarmament negotiations might resume in Geneva. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) According to well-informed sources, the British Cabinet Sub-Committee recently held a meeting chaired by Lord President of the Council MacDonald, with seven cabinet members in attendance. The following resolutions were passed: (1) To make the greatest possible effort to ensure that the Portuguese government participates in the work of the Adjustment Committee for non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War. (2) The Cabinet Sub-Committee decided that the British government should support France's efforts regarding arms reduction in Geneva. British cabinet members speculate that Germany's opposition to Britain and France on the issue of arms expansion is inevitable, which may be understood by German Head of State Hitler. (3) Regarding negotiations for convening a five-power Locarno conference, it was decided not to rush it, lest Germany demand the abolition of the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact. (4) To hear a report from Palestine regarding the recent Arab rebellion. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>The Assembly Appoints Chairmen of Various Committees</h3>

<h3>The Issue of Abyssinian Representation; Two Factions Confront Each Other in the League of Nations; The Great Powers Do Not Want to Displease Italy; The Small Countries Insist on Protecting the Rights of the Weak</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The decision of the Credentials Committee of the League of Nations Assembly to refer the matter of Abyssinia's request to attend the Assembly to the Permanent Court of International Justice in The Hague for a decision may cause serious international disputes. Now, apart from Rome viewing this as an attempt to obstruct the harmony between Italy and the League of Nations, the representatives of the League of Nations will also be divided into two factions. The representatives of several great powers form one faction, known as the "realist faction." This faction said that Italy's withdrawal from the world radio conference was a warning, making it known that Abyssinia should be excluded from the League of Nations to avoid hindering the new European peace mechanism. The delegations of the small countries also form one faction, known as the "idealist faction." This faction firmly believes that the principle of protecting the rights of small countries is more important than Mussolini's cooperation with the League of Nations. At the same time, according to sources in Rome, the Italian government must wait until the League of Nations excludes Abyssinia before it plans to send a delegation to Geneva. The decision of the Credentials Committee greatly surprised Italy. Now, it is believed that Italy will refuse to participate in the Locarno Conference until the ruling of the Hague Tribunal on this issue is announced. If the ruling of the Hague Tribunal is unfavorable to Italy, it seems that Italy will no longer participate in any new Western European security agreement. The decision of the Credentials Committee will now be submitted to the Plenary Session of the League of Nations Assembly for a vote. Even this move has raised new questions: Whether recourse to the Hague Tribunal must be unanimously approved to be effective, or whether it can be effective with only a majority vote. If unanimous approval is necessary, this move may be difficult to achieve, because countries that have not imposed sanctions on Italy, such as Austria, Hungary, and Albania, will definitely vote against it. Even with this entanglement unresolved, another difficulty will arise: Whether Abyssinia's representatives should be suspended from attending the Assembly meetings while the Hague Tribunal has not made a decision. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Italy Withdraws from the Radio Conference; No Less Than a Warning to the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Italian delegation attending the International Radio Conference officially stated today that it did not want to continue participating in the work of the conference. Although the reasons it stated were purely technical, the general public in Geneva felt that the delegation's withdrawal from the conference was actually decided by Rome. This shows that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is dissatisfied with the League of Nations Assembly's attitude toward Abyssinia. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Legal Experts Draft a List of Questions; To Consult the Hague Tribunal</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Assembly will only be able to decide on the issue of whether the Abyssinian delegation can continue to attend when it holds an open meeting tomorrow afternoon. At that time, the Credentials Committee attending will be able to submit a final report to the Assembly. Legal experts are now drafting a list of questions to ask the Permanent Court of International Justice in The Hague: Whether the Abyssinian Emperor can still send a delegation to represent Abyssinia at international conferences. As for the question of whether the Abyssinian delegation can continue to attend the League of Nations Assembly before the International Court of Justice makes a decision, it will be decided by a vote of the Assembly. The outcome of the vote will inevitably be that some will advocate attendance and some will oppose attendance. It is still too early to speculate on which faction will be in the majority.

<h3>All Roads Lead to One Place; Spanish Rebels Encircle the Capital; The Final Battle Begins at Any Moment; The Strategic Pass South of the Capital Was Occupied Yesterday</h3>

The government forces and rebels north of the capital are now digging trenches opposite each other on the peaks of the Guadarrama Mountains. However, in several places, the rebels have advanced to the Madrid area, threatening the headquarters of the government forces. The highway northeast to Zaragoza is now controlled by the rebels guarding Siguenza. The government forces south of the capital occupy Toledo, but they are hampered by the rebels in the Alcazar fortress, who are fighting to the death. The rebels in the fortress received a notice dropped by plane, stating that reinforcements would arrive within 48 hours. Therefore, although they were forced to withdraw from the stables and granaries in the fort, they are still hiding in underground caves, fighting hard to await the arrival of reinforcements. Only the southeast can be used by the government forces to transport military supplies and reinforcements. This road must pass through Albacete and Valencia. The rebel front in the southwest stretches from Torrijos (45 miles from Madrid) to Quismondo (5 miles from Maqueda), about 41 miles from the capital. After the government forces were defeated in Maqueda, they are now holding Quismondo. The town seems to be the focus of the rebels' general attack on the capital, because from there there is a wide motor road through flat land directly to the capital. The rebels in the west, northwest, and southwest have now joined together, but the mountain defenders are too thin, so the rebels are now almost surrounding their destination. However, a gap remains between Toledo and a point due east of Aranjuez. Aranjuez is located at a railway intersection and is now the only way out for the government forces. According to the rebel headquarters, there is now a strong force with a large number of aircraft gathered in the territory of Toledo, preparing to attack. The army will be commanded by General Varela, who has been overseeing the battle in the Malaga area until now. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Burgos) As a result of the rebels' occupation of the strategic town of Maqueda, 60 miles south of Madrid, yesterday, Madrid's position has fallen into a desperate situation. According to a senior rebel commander here, "Anything can happen now." Because the fall of Maqueda made the highway from the town to Ávila unobstructed, the rebels were able to advance to Toledo. Yesterday, the sound of artillery fire from the Alcazar fortress was incessant. After Prime Minister Caballero personally inspected the fortress, the artillery intensified its bombardment of the watchtower in the fort. However, by dusk, the watchtower still stood tall, so the government forces occupying a part of the fortress had no choice but to retreat. Before the fall of Maqueda, several rebel planes participated in a desperate battle and shelled the town fiercely. Three columns of rebels began to attack from the south, center, and north at dawn. Before the rebel planes destroyed the government defenses, the three columns were temporarily blocked by the mechanized government forces and could not advance. Before long, the shelling was successful, and the government militia lost their fighting spirit and boarded long-distance buses to retreat to Torrijos, 15 miles north of Toledo. The rebels, led by Moroccan troops, then occupied the town and pursued the victory. It is reported that the rebels killed thousands of militiamen in the battle. It is also reported that after the fall of Maqueda, there was a fierce battle between the planes of the rebels and the government forces at one time, but the government planes arrived too late to help the defenders. Soon, three rebel bomber planes flew over the city of Toledo and dropped bombs, destroying the important railway bridge in the Vargas area, connecting Madrid and Extremadura.

<h3>The Mountain Pass Fell; The Government Forces Were Forced to Retreat</h3>
<p>(Paris) A telegram received here from Talavera de la Reina said that as a result of the advance of the Spanish rebels in the Sierra de Gredos area, they have occupied the Puerto del Pico pass, and the highway to Ávila has been opened. It is reported that the government troops installed machine guns in the snow-covered Sierra de Gredos and even dragged cannons to the tops of two mountain peaks to control the small pass and the ancient Roman highway. Two rebel cavalry teams attacked the government troops stationed beside the mountain and defeated them. The government troops have retreated into the mountains. It is also reported that the government troops shot more than 500 people in the village of Arenas de San Pedro, including 15 young women, which accounted for almost one-tenth of the village's population. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>The Rebel Attack on the Northern Front of the Capital Was Frustrated</h3>
<p>(Madrid) According to news from the Guadarrama Mountains front, the rebels suffered a major defeat in the battle near the Lozoya Reservoir, the main water supply source for the capital, and suffered heavy losses. The government troops have discovered more than 400 rebel soldiers' corpses, all of whom were killed while trying to break through the Madrid northwestern front. The intensity of this offensive was unprecedented, continuing day and night. Although the rebels had approached the government trenches and could launch hand grenades, they were taken advantage of by the government forces due to the darkness and suffered heavy losses before retreating, abandoning a lot of military materials. The government forces took advantage of the victory to pursue to a place two miles away before stopping. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<h3>Lansing Memoirs: Japan Plans to Refute</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) During the First World War, U.S. Secretary of State Lansing concluded the Ishii-Lansing Agreement with Japan's Ishii. Therefore, Lansing's posthumous manuscript, "Lansing's War Memoirs," was publicly sold by Merrill Publishing House this spring. The contents describe the famous Zimmermann Telegram leak incident, and the bold exposure of major international political secrets during the greatest crisis of the time caused a great stir around the world. Those parts concerning Japan are full of malicious criticism, stating that Japan's participation in the war was intended for aggression. This is not only a major insult to Japan, but also, without the understanding of the Japanese government, the secret diplomatic documents exchanged between Japan and the United States regarding the Twenty-One Demands on China were published. Therefore, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has expressed great dissatisfaction with this breach of international trust and has commissioned Dr. Hayashi Ikuo, a prominent authority on Japanese diplomatic issues, former President of Keio University, and a member of the Imperial Academy, to draft a lengthy rebuttal essay. It is scheduled to be published in mid-October to reject the harmful biases against Japanese-American diplomacy. After being conveyed this intention by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the doctor, despite being 79 years old, gladly agreed for the sake of Japanese diplomacy. With the assistance of the authorities, he extensively researched the diplomatic materials of China, Japan, and the United States at that time. From the free and impartial standpoint of a scholar, he refuted Lansing's arbitrary and fallacious views, stating that the Japanese-German war was based on the Anglo-Japanese alliance, with the goal of world peace, and based on facts such as the spirit of friendship with China. The full text reaches 80 pages of the original manuscript and is titled "Lansing's Memoirs and Its Slanders." It is decided that the essay will be published in the diplomatic magazine "Gaikō Jihō" in mid-October. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will translate it into English to make the world recognize Japan's just position. (Domei, 23rd)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Financial Report Advocates Adjustments to World Prices</h3>
<p>(London) The League of Nations Financial Committee issued a report today stating that because there is no parity between prices and currency values, exchange rates cannot be balanced. This is a major obstacle to the progress of global recovery. The report agrees with the views of the Economic Committee, that is, if we want to restore economic exchanges to normalcy, we must eliminate the abnormal gaps that separate the price levels of various countries. The report also fully agrees with the opinion that it is now appropriate for countries to handle currency issues themselves and that holding a world conference at this time would not be beneficial. Any attempt at international economic cooperation should first focus on the opinions of a limited number of countries that seem to have influence over current events. Furthermore, it believes that future currency adjustments, if not accompanied by the relaxation of strict import restrictions, and ultimately leading to their elimination, will not bring any progress to the current economic situation. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) Financial figures here explained that this report advocates that countries in the Gold Bloc should adjust the price of their currencies so that they are equivalent to the currencies of the Sterling Bloc. Regarding this matter, when French Treasury personnel visited Washington earlier, the U.S. government is rumored to have provided a promise to maintain the current exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the franc. However, financial figures here do not want to maintain the exchange rate between the pound and the franc. Therefore, the negotiations currently being conducted by Britain, France, and Belgium are of great significance. (Havas, 23rd)</p>

<h3>Japanese Finance: Requests 3.3 Billion Yen; Income 2.7 Billion Yen</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The total amount of the budget requests from various ministries for the next fiscal year has reached 3.3 billion yen. The Ministry of Finance is currently reviewing its contents. The Ministry of Finance intends to decide on the budget amount approved for each ministry based on the revenue from the planned increase in national taxes.

<h3>Insurance Fees Provided for Japanese Goods Transported to China</h3>

<h3>Measures to Restrict Official Telegram Fees</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Since the implementation of the strict enforcement of the revised official military telegram fee and restriction measures by the Ministry of Communications, the following sixteen provinces that have agreed to pay fees in accordance with regulations include Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Shandong, Fujian, Sichuan, Jiangxi, Suiyuan, Gansu Qinghai, Yunnan, Guizhou, etc., as well as the Northwest Bandit Suppression Headquarters. A few other agencies still state that they have financial difficulties and cannot comply. Therefore, the Ministry of Communications has drafted measures and presented them to the Executive Yuan for instructions, consulting with the Ministries of Finance and Military Affairs to determine the following three measures, requesting the Executive Yuan to forward them to the National Government for compliance, and sending a letter to the Central Secretariat for review. (1) Various agencies sending telegrams, starting from July 1, should uniformly pay in cash in accordance with the above revised measures. All military agencies that fail to comply should be ordered to be responsible for payment. If other agencies are unable to pay due to the fact that the budget for the 25th year has already been allocated and the amount listed for telegram fees is insufficient, they should state the reasons and report to their respective supervising agencies for review. (2) Telecommunications is an important national undertaking. If it is not thoroughly rectified, its impact on politics and military affairs will be significant. Rectification and maintenance require funds everywhere. If the measures are not strictly followed, there is a risk of collapse. Various agencies must comply with the stipulated measures, and those who do not comply may have their telegram services suspended. (3) Non-urgent matters should be sent by express mail instead of sending telegrams at every turn. Telegram texts should be concise. The Executive Yuan has recently issued an order to comply.

<h3>Japan Reinforces Hankou. Japan Claims the Yoshioka Incident Occurred at Mei Foo Wharf. Our Side Discovers Eyewitnesses but Japan Refuses Consultation. Japanese Consul Miura Pays a Brief Visit to Yang Yongtai.</h3>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: Regarding the case of the Japanese policeman Yoshioka being shot, it occurred within the Japanese concession, beyond the reach of Chinese political forces. Therefore, the Japanese authorities themselves must strive to investigate the case and arrest the perpetrators, while our government can only provide assistance under the principle of fostering friendly relations. However, observing the Japanese actions, including the landing of naval forces, police searches, erection of electric fences, meetings of officials and civilians, and reinforcement of troops to Hankou, all demonstrate their excessive tension. On the 21st, Japanese naval marines patrolled outside the concession twice with loaded weapons. On the 22nd, the destroyers "Ren" and "Mu" sailed from Shanghai to Hankou, carrying more than 200 naval marines, all anchored on the river in the Japanese concession, together with the originally anchored Ataka, Atami, Futami, and Katada ships, totaling six ships. Although the exact number of naval marines is unknown, it must be over 1,000 people. After the case occurred, the Japanese arrested Chinese hawkers, one being an old man and the other a child. The old man, Huang Qingyun, testified that he and the child Liu Ya's father set up stalls next to each other. On that day, Ya's father went to work at the Chinese wharf, instructing Ya to watch the stall. He heard two gunshots nearby and immediately went out to investigate, seeing the Japanese policeman fall to the side of the post from a distance, without seeing anyone fleeing. Although Huang is old, he feels his observations are more accurate than those of an eight-year-old child. However, the Japanese authorities seem to suspect that he was shot on the Chinese street and moved to the side of the post. After the Sino-Japanese joint trial the day before, today they requested the Municipal Government Secretary Zhang Xianghuai, Police Bureau Inspector General Wang Yufen, and Section Chief Dong Keren to consult, starting from 4:30 p.m. and ending at 6:30 p.m. At the same time, our Pacification Commissioner's Office and Provincial Government ordered the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters, Hankou Municipal Government, and Wuhan Police Bureaus to thoroughly investigate household registrations and examine suspicious persons. The Municipal Police Bureau also found several important eyewitnesses near the scene of the incident. The Municipal Government notified the Japanese side to send personnel to the Police Bureau for consultation at 3:30 p.m. on the 22nd. Because the Japanese personnel did not arrive, it had to be rescheduled, demonstrating the efforts of our authorities to assist. The Japanese Consul-General Miura has been meeting with Mayor Wu Guozhen for days to discuss assistance in the investigation. Today, the 22nd, he led two staff members across the river from Hankou to the Provincial Government to visit Chairman Yang Yongtai for a brief conversation. The content of the conversation is still unknown. However, the Japanese claim that the incident occurred not at the intersection of Nisshin Wharf and Dazheng Street, but near Mei Foo Wharf. As far as this reporter knows, in August of the Republic of China year 17, our four police departments set up posts in the area of Taikoo Dock and Yizi Street. The Japanese Police Chief Ogawa personally went to the branch bureau in charge and claimed that the area belonged to the Japanese concession, forcing us to withdraw the posts there. After several negotiations, when Liu Wendao was the head of Hankou in the 20th year, Police Chief Huang Zhenxing requested to consult with the Japanese Consul, stating that the public security management of the area was unclear and that bandits and communists could easily hide there, and that the police boundary line should be jointly measured and demarcated. The Japanese Consul replied that the boundary line there, that is, the line from the side of Sanxing Foreign Firm to the side of Taikoo Dock, including Taikoo Dock, forms a straight line, and there is no need for measurement, etc. These facts are only a few years old, and many people can testify to them. The government should also still have records. Therefore, the location of the incident, even if it is Mei Foo Wharf, is within the Japanese concession. (September 22nd)</p>
<h3>Minnan Zhangzhou Area: Serious Bandit Disaster in Zhao'an. Meizhou and Xitan in Weiying Township are Occupied. Communists Burn and Loot, Losses are Huge. Sun Dingwen Launches a Large-Scale Suppression After Returning to Zhangzhou.</h3>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: The communist bandits Wu Jin, Yu Dingren, Yu Qitou, and others in Zhao'an County, Zhangzhou, are causing disturbances in Meizhou in the fourth district, Xitan in the third district, and Weiying in the second district, all of which are large townships with strong clans and resilient people with strong self-defense capabilities, long coveted by the communist bandits. Recently, Meizhou was attacked and occupied by Wu Jin and others, with more than 20,000 yuan looted and seven or eight village chiefs and wealthy households kidnapped. Except for five or six people who were redeemed, two are still in the bandit dens. Xitan was also occupied by bandits. Xitan was originally divided into upper and lower sections. The villagers in the upper section were incited by bandits and have mostly become bandits. The lower section suddenly felt weak in self-defense and was occupied by bandits. Several section chiefs were killed in this battle, dozens of rifles and short guns were looted, several houses were burned, the entire township was looted, and losses were no less than 100,000 yuan. Many people were also kidnapped and have not been released. The organization of the Baos, Jias and strong young men in Weiying was originally very strict, and it was not easy for strangers to infiltrate. The villagers are also brave and good at fighting. In view of the losses in Meizhou and Xitan, the security measures were strengthened. Every household in the township has guns. Those with money contribute money, and those without money contribute labor. They are also very united. At about 6 p.m. on the 15th, the communist bandits Wu Jin, Yu Dingren, and Yu Qitou jointly launched a sudden attack. The township reported to the Zhao'an County Government for help while dispatching strong young men to guard the key points in the township to resist. The two sides fought fiercely, and the artillery fire was very intense. After holding out until the morning of the 16th, the bandits used automatic rifles, machine guns, and Mauser pistols to cover the charge, and used homemade cannons to bombard, destroying all the wooden barriers and obstacles. The strong young men had no danger to defend and were captured. They still fought in the streets for a long time before retreating. The bandits then looted the entire township. The Zhou Battalion of the 80th Division stationed in the county seat rushed to support, and the bandits were preparing to retreat. The army pursued and captured three bandits, killed several, and confiscated four or five guns. In this battle, twelve strong young men were killed in battle, twenty-one were injured, and several guns were lost. In the afternoon, the army withdrew to the county seat, and the bandits returned to the township and looted it wantonly. Many villagers from Changpu, Shangyingzai, Shencuzhai, and Huxiangwei participated in the bandit party. The looting and destruction were extremely tragic, the losses were too great, and the people were terrified, and they moved to the county seat one after another. In addition, most of the villages in the second and third districts have become bandits, and the people are extremely afraid of bandits. They were coerced by the bandits, and the land has been distributed according to population in the Hunei area. The fields have been dug up and almost destroyed. Chen Qi arrived in Zhao'an on the morning of the 16th and took a special train to Zhangzhou. He agreed to the request of the party and government authorities and various agencies and social groups in Zhao'an to leave a battalion of Zhang Feiyuan temporarily stationed in Zhao'an, and then go after the relief troops arrived. In addition, Xikou Township in the second district of Shanghang, western Fujian, is close to the Yan Yong border. On the evening of the 11th, more than 100 bandits from Liao Haitao's troops suddenly came and fought fiercely with the strong young men until 3 a.m. on the 12th. Although the blockhouse was not breached, the bandits had entered the township and burned a large house of the Joint Guarantee Director Zhang Jingming's family and more than 20 households, killing 19 villagers, kidnapping more than 20 people, and looting tens of thousands of yuan worth of property. Chiang Ting-wen, Director of the Pacification Office in Fujian, returned to Zhangzhou from Guangdong on the 18th of this month, and summoned the division and brigade commanders to inquire about the recent bandit situation in western Fujian and Zhangzhou, and instructed on the suppression strategy. It was completed on the 21st, and the division and brigade commanders returned to their defenses separately and launched a large-scale suppression on the same day, which should be able to eliminate the bandits.</p>
<h3>Li Zongren Returns to Guangxi. Withdrawal of the Weng Division Stationed in Beihai. Nanning Conference Begins to Handle the Aftermath in Guangxi. Guangdong Army Takes Over Beihai and Investigates the Nakano Case.</h3>
<p>Li Zongren, Director of the Pacification Office in Guangxi, and Huang Xuchu, Chairman of the Guangxi Provincial Government, flew to Guangdong on the 17th to visit Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to ask for instructions on the aftermath of the Guangxi situation. After Li arrived in Guangdong, he and Chief of General Staff Cheng Qian, Chairman Huang Shaoxiong, and others formulated a plan for the aftermath of the Guangxi situation, discussed it in detail with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and discussed issues of concern to the two Guangdongs with the Guangdong military and political authorities. At 1 p.m. on the 19th, Li and Huang visited Chiang again. In addition to discussing the aftermath measures in Guangxi Province, they also discussed important national policies. Li and Huang retired at about 5 p.m. Li said that the Guangxi situation needed to be urgently returned to Guangxi to discuss and deal with Bai Chongxi, so he returned to visit Huang Musong, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, Yu Hanmou, Director of the Guangdong Pacification Office, and his old friends in Guangdong on the evening of the 19th. The next morning (the morning of the 20th), he took a plane back to Guangxi. Although Yu, Huang, and others wanted to host a banquet for Li that evening, it was too late. Li Zongren then took Huang Xuchu by car from Jiyuan, Dongshan to Tianhe Airport at 8:30 a.m. on the 20th. Those who saw him off included Ju Zheng, Cheng Qian, Qian Dajun, Yu Hanmou, Huang Musong, Xiang Hanping, Xu Jingtang and dozens of others. After Li and Huang got off the car, they exchanged greetings with the well-wishers, and then boarded the Junkers giant plane and headed west. All the well-wishers did not withdraw until the trace of the plane had disappeared. According to Li's statement to others before his departure, the results of this decision to come to Guangdong to visit Chiang Kai-shek were satisfactory. The number of troops in Guangxi Province has also been determined, and the military expenses will be subsidized by the central government every month. After Bai Chongxi has reorganized the troops, he can take up a new position. Another said that Li's hurried return to Guangxi was because the Weng Zhaoyuan's army in Guangxi had been stationed in Beihai for a long time and had not yet withdrawn. This move made it difficult to investigate the Nakano case, so the authorities urgently ordered Li to return to Guangxi to first withdraw the Weng's army stationed in Beihai in order to facilitate diplomatic progress. After Li arrived in Yongning, he convened a meeting with Bai Chongxi and others in Nanning to report on his visit to Chiang in Guangdong, and that the Guangxi army would be reorganized in accordance with the central government's establishment. It is heard that the Guangxi army will now be organized into divisions, with 20 regiments of soldiers, organized into six to eight divisions. The serial numbers will be listed as the Fifth Route Army, and Li Zongren will also serve as the commander-in-chief. The old troops of Cai Tingkai will be incorporated into the Guangxi army. After the establishment of the Fifth Route Army Headquarters, the former Fourth Group Army Headquarters and various district garrison commands of Guangxi Province will be revoked separately. As for Bai Chongxi's whereabouts, it has not yet been determined. It is expected that he will not be able to leave Guangxi until all the Guangxi army has been demobilized. After Li Zongren returned to Yongning, he immediately telegraphed the Weng Zhaoyuan's army stationed in Beihai to withdraw to the Guangxi border to await orders. The two division commanders, Weng Zhaoyuan and Qiu Zhaochen, then began to withdraw the troops stationed in Lianjiang, Hua County and Beihai on the 21st, and sent a telegram to Guangdong to report. The original telegram said, "Limited to arrival in Guangzhou immediately, General Commander Yu (Hanmou), Deputy Commander Xiang (Hanping), Staff Officer Xu (Jingtang), and Mr. Deng Yineng (Shizeng) were all informed. 1. The Hao telegram and Yi Gong's letter have been received. 2. Brother Zhuoyun has returned to Meiluo, and everything has been entrusted to him to convey. 3. The battalion of the Tan Division that took over Beihai has been asked to stop at Gongguanwei, and two officers will be sent to Beihai immediately to scout the position in advance. Tomorrow morning, Beihai will be handed over to the battalion to defend. This army also ordered the two division commanders, Tan Sui and Wu Jianhong, to advance from Gongguanwei to Lianjiang and Beihai on the 21st to take over the defense of the area. On the afternoon of the 21st, Weng Zhaoyuan's troops will be able to withdraw completely. As soon as the Fourth Route Army Tan Division is stationed in Beihai, Ling Tufen, the secretary sent by the Special Commissioner's Office for Diplomacy between Guangdong and Guangxi, will be able to land and conduct an investigation into the Nakano case and start negotiations with the Japanese side."

Every day, he was only interested in seducing women. Yang A'quan's wife, a carpenter, was young and beautiful, and Xingsheng seduced her into adultery. They often met in secret. They continued their affair the night before, and were caught by the husband, who became angry and burned with anger. He took a sharp axe and chopped Xingsheng hard. He fled in pain, covered in blood, fearing being reprimanded by his father. He went to the river to wash his wound, but died on the ground due to excessive blood loss.

<h3>Suzhou: Three Routes of Land and Water Bandit Suppression</h3>
<p>Robberies and thefts have been frequently reported in various villages, and the bandit problem in Taihu Lake has resurfaced. Some days ago, the water police forces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces jointly suppressed the bandits in the Changbai Lake area bordering Jiangsu and Zhejiang. They encountered bandits opening fire in the Yangcheng Lake area, and the bandits abandoned their boats and fled. Now, the land and water public security authorities and the security team, in order to thoroughly suppress the bandits, jointly decided at a meeting to set out on three routes yesterday morning (23rd) for a large-scale joint suppression. The first route was the water police, led by District Chief Zhou as the commander-in-chief, leading the Anjing and Zhizhong warships and special teams, etc., which set out at 4 a.m. yesterday (23rd) and headed to Taihu Lake and the Yangcheng Dianshan lakes area to search and suppress.

<h3>Wuxi: Tragic Death of Young Boss of Sauce Garden</h3>
<p>Tao Zhonghou, the owner of the sauce garden and workshop of Bu Taochang outside the North Gate Wuqiao, is 68 years old. His wife, Mrs. Zhu, is about the same age. They have one son and four daughters. The son, named Zhaonian, is 30 years old and has one son and one daughter. There are more than ten branches in and out of the county, and the business is developed. In Wuxi, he can be called a wealthy man. However, the Tao family and his son are usually stingy, so there is very little contact with the outside world. In the afternoon of the previous (22nd), Zhaonian was riding a barge in the Beidiaochiao branch store, intending to go to the Wuqiao General Store. When the boat arrived at Jiangjiankou, a machine boat was driving towards it. Due to an accident, the two boats collided with each other. Zhaonian was standing at the bow of the boat looking at the scenery, and was knocked into the river and drowned. The machine boat was detained and negotiations were initiated. The body has now been salvaged. The Zhonghou couple were in tears and grief-stricken.</p>

Then she returned home and continued to fight. After the neighbors persuaded her to stop, she suddenly burst into anger on the 22nd at midnight. The husband and wife fought again. Mrs. Gu was furious and rushed out the back door, jumping into the river to commit suicide. Tingbiao saw that the situation was not good and bravely chased after her, jumping in to save her. Mrs. Gu became flustered and grasped Tingbiao tightly. Tingbiao, although he knew how to swim, was unable to break free. Both husband and wife became the servants of the waves. After the wife's younger brother and others discovered it, they were salvaged. The two corpses were still embracing each other. Mrs. Gu was already seven months pregnant. The onlookers were horrified.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Zhou Tongzhi Escorted to the Province</h3>
<p>The county's telegraphic newspaper, for publishing personal news about the Security Team's soldiers, had its entire building destroyed on the night of the 5th of this month by Zhou Tongzhi, the leader of a division, leading the crowd. The group was shocked. The newspaper is temporarily operating from a fake inn office until the matter is resolved. Afterwards, the Security Command of Wuxi District sent personnel to Chang to investigate. The case has been reported to the Ministry, and the culprit of the incident, Zhou Tongzhi, has been escorted to Wuxi. However, Director Xiang of the Provincial Security Office attaches great importance to this matter.

<h3>Funing: Bank Employee Collaborates with Bandits and is Detained</h3>
<p>Last month, the Baitan Farmers Bank agent office in this county was robbed of a large sum of money by bandits. Although the Security Brigade tried to investigate, it has not been solved. The bank transferred Yuan Shuren, the person in charge of the office, back to the Funing branch. Unexpectedly, Zhu, the deputy commander of the Yancheng District Security Command, came to Funing for inspection and learned that Yuan Shuren was suspected of colluding with Sun Houfu, Song Shaoqing, and others to rob the bank. Deputy Commander Zhu interrogated Yuan and others in detail and then handed them over to the Security Brigade for custody. Yesterday, he ordered them to be sent to the brigade for interrogation. After receiving the order, the team dispatched a team today to escort Yuan Shuren, Sun Houfu, Song Shaoqing, and three others to the Yancheng District Command for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Change of Director of Highway Bureau</h3>

Cao, who also concurrently served as a technician at the Construction Bureau, requested and was granted permission to resign. He took the early train to Shanghai yesterday morning (the 23rd) and took a boat to Guangdong. The vacancy will be filled by Chen Cong, the director of the Transportation Management Office of the Construction Bureau, who is scheduled to take over on October 1st. Cao's predecessor appointed Yu Shiqian, the chief of the General Affairs Section, to be responsible for handling the handover.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing: Chamber of Commerce Requests Exemption from Household Tax</h3>
<p>The Jiaxing County Government decided to levy household tax on the security group and household tax on shops at the same rate starting from the 25th year. However, the county's farmland has suffered from poor harvests, and the rural economy is bankrupt, resulting in the decline of all industries. Urgent government relief is needed, but even this may not be enough. If household taxes are levied again, it would be like adding insult to injury, and it would be impossible to accept. The County Chamber of Commerce and the Xinhuang and other town chambers of commerce have separately submitted requests to the provincial and county governments to cancel the household tax to alleviate the suffering of merchants and residents.</p>
<h3>European Travel Correspondence: The "Conte Verde" Arrives in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>— Xu Yu</p>
<p>From Shanghai to Venice is a journey of 30,000 miles. Traveling on the Italian-owned SS Conte VERDE, which holds world authority as a mail ship, takes 25 days. However, all advertisements promote travel to Europe in "23 days." It is true that it takes 23 days to get to Europe, but those of us who are traveling for the first time only think of Venice as our destination, so everyone mistakenly believes that we can get to Venice in 23 days. The ship weighed anchor at 4:00 PM on August 28th. I don't know if this has anything to do with the economics of advertising the date, but the departure time was set so early. Those who were seeing off passengers did not leave until two or three o'clock. When the passengers woke up, the ship was already at sea.</p>
<p>There were quite a few students on board this time who were going to Europe to study. There were probably 21 going to England, 18 going to Germany, 4 each going to France and Belgium, and 3 or 4 going to Italy. In addition, there were 5 or 6 couples going to work at the Chinese embassy in Italy. Besides that, there was one going to Austria and one or two going to Switzerland. These many Chinese children, whether they have done many things in society for many years, or have experienced much of life in China, or have just come out of university, whether they are on government scholarships or self-funded, are all children of the middle class or above. They all have a skill, and they can have a job in Chinese society. And everyone has a family. Why do they travel across the ocean to foreign countries? Whether it is for knowledge, fame, or profit, it is all for the sake of a bright future, and because they are dissatisfied with the current situation.</p>
<p>Almost all the students take second-class economy, but there are also passengers in the lower hold. In addition to Indians, the passengers are Chinese. Those Chinese are small merchants or craftsmen. Although they may not all be boarding the ship in Italy, they are leaving their hometowns for distant lands, and the various oppressions and hardships they suffer on the dock, on the ship, and in foreign lands far exceed those of the group of students. I once visited them a few days ago. The same place and berth, from Shanghai to Singapore, cost some people 75 yuan and others 35 yuan, a difference of such a large amount. People who don't know about it won't believe it, but friends who have traveled on Beiyang, Nanyang, and Yangtze River ships all know that to get to Tianjin or somewhere, the price of the same cabin can fluctuate by ten or so yuan, so there is nothing surprising about the high or low prices of ships here. There are countless hooligans in China who live by extorting money at the docks, and countless hooligans in the countryside who live by extorting money from the land. There are also countless people in education and politics... In short, if all the hooligans in China could obediently eat by working hard, there would be no traitors to sell the country and they would disappear. All unclear politics have an unclear group of people as a background, and they are mutually exploited. The function-style can only exist on one side. However, that group of small merchants and craftsmen still endure these thousands of deceptions and humiliations to go outside. Why is that? Isn't it still for the sake of seeking a bright future, because they are dissatisfied with the status quo and seek to move forward.</p>
<p>This shows that Chinese people are not unable to be dissatisfied with the status quo, and are not unable to seek progress, but they only seek individual improvement and have no collective resistance. The so-called individual improvement is a phenomenon that exists in the biological world. In the biological world, there are often changes in one's own physiological organization due to unsuitability to the environment. Collective resistance, on the other hand, changes the environment to suit one's own survival. This only exists in human society.</p>
<p>I am not saying that seeking individual improvement is an animal behavior. Individual improvement is also common among humans. Raising children can also be said to be individual improvement, and giving them education is also individual improvement. But the purpose of individual improvement in biology is to adapt to the environment, while in humans it is the opposite, it is to improve the environment. This is what makes humans superior to biological beings. However, there are not a few Chinese students who have returned to their country, and most of what we know is that they only adapt their individuals to the environment and engage in personal competition within the environment. Taking doctors as an example, there are thousands upon thousands of doctors in the cities, all of whom are capable students who have studied abroad, but they are all competing for business in the cities. There are very few who contact each other to change a small town or city into an environment with a scientific hospital! Taking education as an example, many, many capable students who have studied abroad only compete for positions, control, and squeeze others in the cities after returning. Who is willing to go to small cities and towns to run education and improve the educational environment? So, from these places, it can be seen that most Chinese people improve their individuals, can only adapt to the environment, and cannot improve the environment.</p>
<p>There are many Chinese people studying abroad who are good at their studies and have good knowledge. They go to foreign countries with great difficulty for the purpose of studying and improving themselves, so they often work harder than people from other countries, and their grades can also be above those of others. So, in terms of seeking individual improvement, Chinese people are not weak. So why can they only adapt to the environment after arriving in China, and cannot improve the environment?</p>
<p>This is because they lack collective organization and habits. Improving the environment requires this kind of organization and habits. It may not be possible for one doctor to run a hospital in a small town, but it is necessary to gather several doctors to be competent. The cultivation of this habit lies in the attention and connection during the process of individual improvement. Why do you study medicine abroad? You will definitely tell me that the equipment is good, the materials are good, and the organization is complete, so when you improve yourself, you must pay attention to improving the environment of your individual.</p>
<p>I once took a class from a Professor Zhou at the university. This professor was in charge of advanced psychological experiments, but he himself not only could not install the mechanical equipment for psychological experiments, but also did not understand it. As a result, many machines were only listed and not used. I think he may not have even seen these machines. However, when he was studying, he only did the experiment once on someone else's already installed frame, and of course he did not know anything about the experimental environment. People like this are not qualified to teach, but not paying attention to the environment is a common problem of Chinese people.</p>
<p>So, this is two-sided: individual improvement and new contact with group organization, understanding of the environment and transformation of the old environment. Among this group of travel companions, I hope they all have this awareness.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Gao Bingfang and Cui Weiwu Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday to Solicit Opinions from All Parties. Liang Jingchuan's Negotiations with the Banking Industry have been Successfully Completed. Gao Liang and Cui Attended the Mayor's Banquet in the Evening to Report on the Progress.</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Liang Jingchuan, the deputy director of the Central Direct Tax Preparation Office of the Ministry of Finance, came to Shanghai a few days ago to discuss the procedures for securities, deposit interest, income, and income tax, and has reached a satisfactory result. It will be implemented on the 1st of next month on schedule, with Chinese and foreigners being treated equally. Gao Bingfang, the director, and Cui Weiwu, the secretary, also arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning to solicit opinions from all parties. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Successful Negotiations</p>
<p>In order to equalize the burden on the people and adjust the state's tax sources, the Ministry of Finance, following the precedents of European and American countries, is implementing income tax and listing it as a central direct tax. Its regulations and detailed rules have long been passed and promulgated by the Legislative Yuan and the Executive Yuan, and it is scheduled to start on the first of next month, and the income tax on securities, interest, and income will be implemented first. The Shanghai banking industry stated that with the implementation imminent, various procedures are still waiting to be negotiated. After research by various banks, they made a statement to the preparation office, and Deputy Director Liang Jingchuan was dispatched to Shanghai to meet with the responsible personnel of various banks and explain in detail. The result was very satisfactory.</p>
<p>Mayor Hosts Banquet</p>
<p>Director Gao Bingfang and Secretary Cui Weiwu of the office also stated that with the opening of the new tax imminent, they must solicit opinions from all parties, so they came to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning. After arriving at the station and checking into their lodgings, they went to the Municipal Government at about 10 o'clock to visit Mayor Wu for talks. In the evening, Mayor Wu and Fang Zhi, the acting Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, hosted a banquet for representatives of various newspapers at Xinghualou, and also invited Gao, Liang, and Cui to participate, introduced them to the members of the newspapers, and invited Peng Ge, the director of the General Propaganda Office of the Central Propaganda Department, to participate. Gao reported on the preparations for the collection of income tax.</p>
<p>Gao's Report</p>
<p>Gao rose from his seat at the banquet and reported, "Taking advantage of Mayor Wu's invitation to you today, and with the call of Minister Fang of the Central Propaganda Department, I will give a brief report on the progress of the preparation for income tax. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, there was a motive for implementing income tax, but it was not successful due to the instability of the political situation. After the Republic of China was rebuilt, the Beijing government decided to deliberate on the implementation in the first, third, fourth, ninth, and tenth years of the Republic of China, but it was also an empty promise and was not implemented, and it ended up being a flash in the pan. After the success of the Northern Expedition in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, the National Government prepared several resolutions, but because of the factual difficulties, it still had no end. It was not until July of last year that Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance drafted a bill in accordance with the policies and political program of the Kuomintang of China, submitted it to the Executive Yuan for resolution, and sent it to the Legislative Yuan for review. This was considered to be the official start. The principles of income tax were passed by the Sixteenth Central Political Committee meeting on June 24th this year. The provisional regulations on income tax were passed by the Legislative Yuan meeting on July 9th. On July 21st, they were promulgated by the National Government. On August 18th, the 275th regular meeting of the Executive Yuan passed the detailed rules for the implementation of the provisional regulations on income tax. On August 22nd, the Executive Yuan announced these detailed rules. The legislative procedure for income tax is roughly like this. As for the content of the provisional regulations on income tax, it is based on the principles of fairness and simplicity, and takes into account the people's ability to pay taxes and the socio-economic conditions. Therefore, the currently set tax rate is extremely low, and the methods used are extremely simple. According to the scope of taxation promulgated in the provisional regulations, it is divided into three categories. The first category is income from profit-making businesses, which is calculated and taxed based on the net profit after deducting expenses. All companies, shops, firms, factories, or individuals with capital of more than 2,000 yuan are taxed on their profit-making income. Capital of less than 2,000 yuan is not collected. The income of government-private joint ventures and temporary profit-making businesses is taxed according to the amount of income in order to be fair. Moreover, the net profit of business income is less than five percent, or temporary income is less than one hundred yuan, and is still exempt from tax. The second category is salary income, which is taxed according to the salary income of civil servants, freelancers, and others engaged in various industries. Those who do not earn an average of 30 yuan per month are also not taxed. Moreover, the salaries of primary school teachers, and the pensions, disabilities, labor, and support funds for civil servants and officers who are injured or killed on duty, as well as the helpless, old-age pensions, alimony, etc., are all exempt from tax. The third category is income from securities deposits, which is taxed on the interest income from public bonds, corporate bonds, stocks, and deposits, calculated on the basis of each decision or settlement payment. The tax rate is no more than fifty per thousand, and the legal savings funds of civil servants and laborers, the foundation deposits of educational charitable organizations or groups, and educational savings funds are also exempt from tax if the annual interest income is less than one hundred yuan. According to the above classification taxation method, the net profit of the first category, profit-making business income, reaches five percent to one point, or the income is above one hundred yuan and up to one yuan, and only 30 per thousand of the net profit is levied. The tax rate for the second category, salary income, averages 30 yuan per month, and a tax of five percent is levied, which is lighter than that of other countries. The collection procedures are divided into two types: one is the method of withholding, such as the salaries of civil servants, which can be withheld by the salary-issuing agency, and the interest on bonds and deposits, which can be withheld by the interest-paying bank or savings association, etc. The second is the method of reporting, first by the taxpayer reporting themselves, and then by the government conducting random inspections and audits. This is the general situation of tax classification and tax rates. As for the progress of myself and my colleagues in preparing for income tax under orders, although there are no significant achievements to comfort everyone's expectations, I am very grateful for the enthusiastic support from all parties, and it has been very smooth and without encountering difficulties. In particular, I would like to thank the news media for their support in promoting the country. However, our office bears this responsibility, and is determined to follow Minister Kong's words: "We are determined to deal with new taxes with new talents and a new spirit." All the required staff will be recruited through examinations. In the first phase, 70 university graduates have been recruited and are now being strictly trained before being sent out to serve. At the same time, an accounting system will be established, and in the future, the collection and receipt of money will be handled separately and supervised by each other. No one can take advantage of loopholes or engage in malpractice. The collection costs will be minimized, and the handling procedures will be simplified. Regardless of the taxpayer, the method of choosing to be careless rather than disturb them is decided, so that they will naturally comply. We want to achieve a state of non-abuse, non-waste, non-panic, and non-disturbance in order to gain the sympathy of the people of the whole country. Foreigners are also treated equally, without any discrimination. Now, the 275th regular meeting of the Executive Yuan has resolved that, starting from October 1st of this year, the salary income of civil servants and the interest on bonds and deposits will be levied first, and the rest will be taxed again from January next year. Those of us in charge can only comply. The Ministry of Finance has now set up an income tax affairs office within the ministry to be responsible for collection affairs. Special commissioners have also been dispatched to various provinces and cities to contact local authorities in stages and handle matters related to the promotion of income tax. In the future, the central and provincial and municipal collection agencies will be based on this reasonable organization, and will gradually expand and improve it according to the needs of tax development and the training and development of talents. At present, the collectors are all incomes using the withholding method, so there is no need to expand the organization. This is the general situation of the preparation. Finally, I want to add that the theory of income tax, of course, everyone is very clear, and there is no need to repeat it. However, there are two very important meanings in coming to handle income tax this time. One is to reform the tax system. China's taxes have always been biased towards indirect taxes, and indirect taxes do not conform to the three principles of universality, fairness, and elasticity of taxes. More than 50 countries around the world that have implemented income tax all use income tax as the main pillar of their national tax revenue. There is absolutely no source that relies solely on indirect taxes, and there is absolutely no country that can become rich and strong without implementing income tax. If the country's finances are not on track, and the politics are not on track, there is no income tax. May I ask everyone, who can arbitrarily say that our country cannot go on the road to being on track? Moreover, since the foundation of indirect taxes is not solid, the country's financial resources, of course, cannot be relied upon as the foundation of taxes. Assuming that the country's situation changes, or the economic situation fluctuates, then indirect taxes will also be affected and unable to maintain the original amount of income. This situation is very likely to affect the stability of the country's finances, and may even shake the foundation of the country. Our country, which is in a precarious situation, must learn from past mistakes and open up a perfect path to establish a sound foundation for the country's finances in order to save the country and survive. This is the first saying. The second is to equalize the burden. We see that 80 percent of the country's population is farmers, and there are also many laborers. How are the burdens of this large group of farmers and workers? Their annual income is very small, but the direct and indirect burdens they bear each year are heavier than anyone else's. Everyone knows this unfair situation, and it can be said that they are suffering unbearably and cannot be saved. In recent years, the government has seen this, and the central and local governments have worked hard to cut and abolish exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous taxes, and want to change the situation, so that the burden of farmers and workers who are unable to pay taxes can be transferred to those who are able to pay taxes. In particular, this plan cannot be implemented without implementing income tax. If we do this, we can maintain the balance and coordination of people's livelihood, and we can equalize the obligation of the burden. The most important goal of equalizing the burden is the people's livelihood issue, and it is also to plan for national security. It is the only way to eliminate hidden dangers. For more than 20 years, the news media has always had the theory of saving the people's livelihood, and the news of the people's livelihood suffering has made the government vigilant day by day, and they have always loudly advocated and urged the government to reform and relieve the people's difficulties in the newspapers. Now it can be said that this decision to implement income tax is to realize the propositions of the news media and complete the goals of the news media. As for the current provisional regulations and methods, no one dares to arbitrarily say that they are perfect, because in our country it is still in its infancy, and it must be improved and progressed according to experience and facts. Talking about the responsibility of promotion, the government absolutely cannot give up its responsibility, and it is hoped that the news media will provide a lot of assistance and guidance. We must work together in order to achieve the long-standing hope of officials and civilians."</p>
<p>Gao's Talk</p>
<p>Gao met with reporters yesterday and said that the government has been preparing for the implementation of income tax for a long time. The consistent advocacy of the public opinion community has enabled the whole country to understand its significance and to implement it on schedule. He is very grateful. This tax is being implemented for the first time in our country, so various procedures need to be studied. Mr. Liang has had satisfactory results in his negotiations in Shanghai, and it will be implemented uniformly in Chinese and foreign banks across the country on schedule. As for foreigners, if there are any unclear points in the methods, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is explaining to various countries, and there will be no problems, he said.</p>
<p>Liang's Talk</p>
<p>Liang then told reporters that he had discussed with the banking industry in Shanghai and had detailed answers to the various procedural questions they had raised. The banks believe that there are no more problems and have decided to conduct a general settlement before implementation to clear the accounts. However, the branches in remote provinces are worried that various forms and other documents cannot be received on schedule and handled at the same time, and they have requested changes to avoid unexpected losses, which has been understood, he said.</p>
<p>Collection Procedures</p>
<p>Nanjing, 23rd, Central News Agency report: The Central Direct Tax Preparation Office of the Ministry of Finance will implement the first classified collection of income tax on October 1st. All income tax payments should be entrusted to the National Bank or the Postal Remittance Bureau for collection in accordance with the regulations of its implementation rules. The Director and Deputy Director of the Office, Gao Bingfang and Liang Jingchuan, are now going to Shanghai to sign a contract with the Three National Banks and the Postal Remittance Bureau for the collection of these taxes. The content of the contract is to stipulate that taxpayers should pay the first and second categories of income tax (not just referring to the income from public bond deposit interest) by self-payment, withholding, and proxy payment. If there is a Central Bank in the local area, it will be handed over to the Central Bank for collection. If there is no Central Bank, it will be handed over to the China and Communications Banks for collection. If there are no China and Communications Banks, it will be handed over to the Post Office for collection. As for the silver money industry, since it will be withholding deposit interest income on behalf of the government from October 1st, it needs to handle more settlement procedures. The authorities may give special rewards in the form of awarding bonuses.</p>
<h3>Case of Japanese Sailors Shot: Around 8:20 PM Last Night, in Front of the Japan Shanghai Bank, One Person Died and Two Were Injured</h3>
<p>Around 8:20 PM last night, at the corner of Wusong Road near Haining Road, in front of the Japan Shanghai Bank, three Japanese sailors were shot. One, a seaman first class named Tagang, was shot in the front chest, the bullet exiting from his back. Another, a seaman second class named Izuriha, was wounded in both arms. The third, a seaman first class named Yahata, was wounded in the right arm. In total, Tagang was shot twice, Izuriha twice, and Yahata once. After the incident, the patrol police immediately reported it to the Hongkou Police Station, which sent a vehicle to take the injured to Fumin Hospital for treatment. However, Tagang died shortly after arriving at the hospital due to his severe injuries. The other two sailors' injuries were not serious and they are expected to recover. They are currently still in the hospital receiving treatment. After the incident occurred, the police immediately began investigating the case. Lieutenant Ban Gu of the Japanese Marine Corps and the Japanese Consulate General also received reports and went to the scene to investigate. When the three sailors were shot, a public bus of route 2 happened to be passing by. It was suspected that the shots were fired from inside the bus, and the driver and ticket seller were once taken in for questioning. However, they were released after it was confirmed that they were not involved. After the incident, the police and Japanese Marine Corps soldiers jointly guarded the area and searched pedestrians. The area of the incident was heavily guarded. At the time of writing, the area was still under guard. During the search, a wooden-cased pistol was found in a yellow sand box placed by the Public Works Department at the intersection, and eight shell casings were found on the ground nearby. At the same time, three suspects were detained. After receiving the news, the Chinese police authorities paid great attention to the matter, fearing that the criminals would escape. They immediately ordered all police stations to send out all detectives to assist in the hunt, paying particular attention to pedestrians at the border between the Chinese and foreign concessions. Until late at night, in addition to the three suspects arrested earlier in Hongkou, who had been taken to the Marine Corps headquarters, there was no further development in the case, according to the Central News Agency. Four sailors from the Japanese warship Izumo were passing the Japan Shanghai Bank at the intersection of Haining Road and Wusong Road in the Public Concession at 8:20 PM on the 23rd, when they were suddenly attacked by gunmen. Seaman first class, Tagang Chaoguang, was shot through the chest and died on the spot. Seaman second class, Izuriha Zangji, and Seaman first class, Yahata Yoshiharu, were wounded in the arms. The other sailor was unharmed. The injured were sent to the Japanese Marine Corps Hospital on Jiangwan Road for treatment. After the incident, the concession police arrested a suspect near the scene and also found a pistol in a garbage can in a nearby alley. After receiving the report, the municipal government immediately ordered the Public Security Bureau to assist in the arrest of the murderers and inspect pedestrians and homes in the area bordering the concessions. After the incident, the Japanese Marine Corps immediately dispatched troops to guard the area near the scene, inspect pedestrians, and patrol in armored vehicles, creating a tense situation.</p>
<p>According to a report from the Tongmeng News Agency in Shanghai on the 23rd, at approximately 8:23 PM tonight, near the Japan Shanghai Bank at the corner of Wusong Road and Haining Road, four Japanese sailors were walking when they were suddenly shot at by a Chinese person with a pistol. A total of eight shots were fired, hitting Seaman First Class Tagang in the chest. The sailor appeared to be attempting to reach the Zhicheng Japanese Bookstore around the corner, but died on the spot due to his injuries. Seaman Second Class Izuriha and Seaman First Class Yahata were also shot in the wrist. One of the assailants attempted to hide the pistol in a nearby sand box and was apprehended on the spot by a patrol officer from the Public Works Department. The others escaped. Detectives from the Japanese Marine Corps and the Hongkou Police Station rushed to the scene to investigate, prohibiting pedestrians from walking nearby. A rigorous search for the suspects was immediately launched, but the remaining accomplices have not yet been apprehended. According to eyewitnesses near the scene, the principal culprit appeared to be a Chinese man in Western clothing, aged 32 or 33, who fled towards North Sichuan Road after the shooting. Detectives from the police station recovered eight shell casings at the scene. A suspect arrested by the police station, a resident of No. 8 Xinruikang Lane, Dixiwei Road, was brought to the location for investigation by Lieutenant Ban Gu of the Japanese Marine Corps, Inspector Nakamura of the Public Works Department, Sergeant Shibuya of the Japanese Military Police, and representatives from the Japanese Consulate General.</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from Guangzhou on the 23rd reports that after news of the murder of a Japanese sailor in Shanghai arrived today, authorities here have taken various precautions to avoid any accidental incidents involving Japanese residents. The Municipal Standing Committee has issued a notice strictly prohibiting anti-foreign activities.</p>
<h3>Results of Lawyer Candidate Recommendations</h3>

<h3>Sino-American Trade Association Held Regular Meeting Yesterday; Decided to Jointly Organize a Tourist Guide Association with Various Organizations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the American Chamber of Commerce, the China International Trade Association, and the Chinese National Committee of the International Chamber of Commerce, in order to promote Sino-American trade, organized the Sino-American Trade Association last year. It is learned that the association held its seventeenth regular meeting at the Bank Club yesterday afternoon. Committee members present included Guo Bingwen, Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Bei Songsun (represented by Xia Pingfang), Van Klingen, Porter, Madi, and honorary secretary Miao Zhongxiu, totaling more than ten people. Li Guochin, a member of the American-Chinese Trade Association, who had just arrived in Shanghai from New York, also attended. During the meeting, the issue of promoting the tourism industry was discussed. It was generally agreed that in various countries, special departments are set up or organizations are formed to promote and publicize tourism with tireless efforts. The income from foreign tourists exceeds tens of millions each year, which is a special income for various countries and can offset import surpluses. Moreover, it can promote culture and international understanding, which is of great benefit. Our country's famous scenic spots are renowned throughout the world, but due to the lack of systematic promotion abroad and the lack of organized guidance at home, European and American tourists abandon our country and go to neighboring countries, resulting in huge losses. It was decided to immediately join forces with various organizations to organize a Tourist Guide Association to conduct publicity and guidance activities, and to appoint committee members to investigate various inconveniences currently experienced by tourists visiting Shanghai and find ways to improve them. In addition, several important cases related to trade were discussed. Finally, Mr. Li Guochin gave a detailed account of the recent situation of the American-Chinese Trade Association. The meeting adjourned at 2:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Outbound Competition on the Yangtze River; Large Quantities of Goods Blocked in Yichang; Shanghai Sichuan Merchant Groups Greatly Alarmed</h3>
<p>Due to the crowding of goods for shipment, freight rates for various Sichuan River shipping companies are rising. For cotton yarn shipped from Shanghai to Chongqing, the lowest freight rate was only three yuan per piece, but it has now risen to eighteen yuan, an increase of six times. With the Upper Yangtze River expected to become shallow soon, freight rates are expected to rise further. It is said that there are discussions to increase rates by another two yuan per piece starting on the first of next month. According to people in Sichuan merchant groups, during the dry season this year, if freight rates continue to increase at this rate, the freight rate for cotton yarn could reach twenty-six yuan per piece. For foreign goods (which are actually domestic goods, such as galoshes, toothbrushes, enamelware, blankets, and towels), the rate is also around one hundred yuan per ton. Therefore, the Sichuan River shipping industry is better than any other shipping route. Currently, the shipping companies operating on this route include Minsheng, Taikoo, EWO, and Nissin, which are all listed as regular liner services on the Yangtze River. According to the Ministry of Transportation's restrictions, non-regular liner services are not allowed to operate on this route, so the allied companies are protected in their business and do not have to worry about ships outside the alliance competing with them. Two months ago, the Shen'ai, a foreign-flagged ship managed by the Yilong Foreign Firm in Shanghai, suddenly changed its route from the Northern Seas to the Upper Yangtze River to compete for Shanghai cargo bound for Sichuan. Because it had a deeper draft and larger hull, it was able to ship heavy cargo directly from Shanghai to Yichang. It then transshipped the cargo onto smaller Sichuan-bound boats for transport upriver. Because the freight rates were cheaper, many customers were eager to use it, and every shipment was fully loaded. The allied companies did not initially pay attention, but recently realized that this move would harm the Sichuan River shipping industry and greatly impact the outgoing goods and freight rates. The companies held a meeting to discuss countermeasures and decided to take a passive resistance approach: all Sichuan-bound boats from the allied companies would refuse to transship goods that had been transported to Yichang by the Shen'ai, so that the goods would be permanently blocked in Yichang and unable to reach Chongqing. This plan was implemented when the Shen'ai arrived in Yichang for the third time. It is said that there are now thousands of pieces of cargo blocked in Yichang, worth hundreds of thousands of yuan. Yichang has sent urgent telegrams to Shanghai. Many Sichuan merchant groups in Shanghai have goods blocked in Yichang. With the Mid-Autumn Festival approaching, the blockage of goods has brought financial activities to a halt. The various groups held a general meeting at the Sichuan Department Store Mutual Aid Association in Shanghai to discuss solutions. As a result, the mutual aid association sent a letter to the shipping companies, requesting them to quickly transship the goods and not allow hundreds of thousands of yuan of goods to be blocked. The original letter was very long and is not reproduced here. If this measure is ineffective, it was decided to appoint representatives to negotiate with the shipping companies in person. The companies have not yet expressed their attitude. It is difficult to predict what will happen in the future. The situation is quite serious. Since this incident, customers have become wary of using non-regular Sichuan River ships. As a result, foreign-flagged ships operating on this route may suspend their operations.</p>
<h3>After Meeting on the Izumo, Wakasugi Flew to Beijing Yesterday to Meet Kawagoe; First Summoned Representatives of Japanese Residents</h3>
<p>Wakasugi Kaname, Counselor of the Japanese Embassy in China and Consul General in Shanghai, accompanied by Ogihara, Secretary of the Embassy, flew to Beijing from Shanghai on a China National Aviation Corporation mail plane at 7:00 AM yesterday to meet with Ambassador Kawagoe in Beijing. Before his departure, Wakasugi convened a meeting on the Izumo at 1:00 PM the day before yesterday. Attendees included Naval Attaché Sato, Assistant Army Attaché Utsunomiya, Commander of the Third Fleet Kawa, and Commander of the Japanese Marine Corps in Shanghai Kondo, among others. They discussed Sino-Japanese issues for forty minutes. Then, at 5:00 PM, he summoned representatives of Japanese residents in Shanghai at the Consulate General. More than ten people attended, including Matsunaga, Acting Chairman of the Japanese Residents Association, Hishida, Chairman of the People's Assembly, and Lin, Honorary Chairman of the Various Road Associations. Japanese Consuls in Shanghai Fukui and Terazaki also attended. The meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>China Economic Society Prepares for Annual Meeting; Thirteenth Session to Last Five Days; Opening Ceremony on the Morning of the 27th; Appointed Responsible Personnel for Each Group; Various Public Organizations to Attend Public Banquet</h3>
<p>The thirteenth annual meeting of the China Economic Society will be held at 9:00 AM on the 27th of this month at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA in this city. The meeting will last five days.

<h3>Zhejiang Literature Exhibition; Shanghai Collection Branch Established; Opening in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Literature Exhibition was originally scheduled to open on October 10th, but due to the impact of the summer weather on the preparations and collection of exhibits, it could not be completed as scheduled. In addition, the elections of National Assembly representatives were being held in various provinces and regions, which further delayed the work of collecting exhibits. Therefore, the exhibition's design committee decided to postpone the opening to October 26th. Currently, collection branches have been established in all nine administrative inspectorates within Zhejiang Province. In Yinxian, Shaoxing, Jiaxing, Taizhou, Yongjia, Jiashan, and Yuhang, preparations are underway to hold literature exhibitions in their respective counties, or have already been held, in accordance with provincial orders. After the exhibitions, the best exhibits will be selected and sent to the province. It is said that Ningbo, Shaoxing, Wen, and Jia have collected many exhibits. The existing local chronicles and registers of successful candidates in the Fan family's Tianyige Library in Ningbo have also been borrowed with the Fan family's consent. The Liu family's Jiayelou Library in Nanxun has a rich collection of books, including rare manuscripts and transcripts of Zhejiang worthies, which will be sent for collection. The association has contacted various bibliophiles in Hangzhou and preparations are underway. It is expected that the exhibited books will be quite spectacular at the time. The association's executive committee held its third meeting on the 19th and plans to convene a meeting of the design committee's standing committee within a week. The Shanghai collection branch was established on the 11th, and Ye Gongchuo has been additionally appointed as the branch's director by the Zhejiang Department of Education, with Zhang Shouyong and Qin Runqing as deputy directors.

<h3>Returned Goods Unable to Obtain Shipping Permits Again: Woolen Fabric Guild Announces Refusal of Returns</h3>
<p>In order to prevent smuggling, the central government has issued a decree requiring goods to obtain a shipping permit before they are allowed to be transported. The Woolen Fabric Guild of this city has announced that goods may not be returned thereafter, as customer groups in various locations often return goods, making it impossible to obtain permits again. The announcement is recorded below:</p>
<p>"Since the implementation of anti-smuggling measures, it has been necessary to obtain shipping permits from the Customs for all transported goods, and the quantity of goods to be transferred has been noted on the original permit. This has been followed uniformly. However, recently, various member firms have reported that customer groups in various locations, after selecting and accepting goods and completing all the necessary shipping permit procedures, suddenly claim that the goods are not as described or use the excuse of sluggish sales to return the goods. The original seller finds it difficult to restore the original state of the permit with the Customs. As the returned goods have lost their permit basis, they cannot be resold, resulting in significant losses. They have requested that restrictive measures be put in place. After investigation, once goods have been selected, inspected, and accepted, and a contract has been agreed upon, there is no reason for returns. To eliminate all disputes, the council has now decided that after customer groups select and receive goods, and the consignee fills out and stamps the shipping permit, no returns will be allowed under any circumstances. This is hereby announced in the newspaper for public knowledge."</p>

<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Yangtze River Transport: Results After Rectification, Using Passenger Revenue as a Comparative Standard, Income Has Increased by More Than 15%</h3>
<p>During the comprador system period, all personnel administration and passenger revenue of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Yangtze River vessels were handled by the business director. The company only collected a fixed amount from the business director each month according to the stipulated ratio. On April 1st of this year, in order to rectify operations and increase revenue, the company abolished the comprador system for all Yangtze River vessels and changed to a system of actual reporting and reimbursement. All personnel administration was directly managed by the company, and all passenger revenue was handed over to the company. On the other hand, the company strictly investigated passengers traveling without tickets, strictly prohibited tea room staff from soliciting tips, improved vessel facilities, and implemented armed escorts. Since implementation, there has been significant progress in improving the convenience and comfort of passengers and maintaining the order and cleanliness of the wharves.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Jiangshun, Jiang'an, Jianghua, Jiangxin, Jiangda, and Jianguo vessels on the Shanghai-Hankou line have seen an increase in passenger revenue even though ticket prices remain the same. From April to July of this year, the total revenue from first, second, third, fourth class, and other passenger tickets was 266,149.21 yuan. After deducting administrative expenses (formerly borne by the compradors, now paid by the company) of 100,597.65 yuan, the net profit was 155,525.46 yuan. Compared with the total fixed amount during the comprador period of 134,468 yuan, the net profit increased by 21,097.46 yuan in four months, accounting for 15.66% of the income during the comprador period. Currently, passengers on most Yangtze River vessels using the comprador system must pay extra for berths and large tips in addition to purchasing tickets, with the total amount nearly equal to the ticket price, which is very uneconomical. Therefore, many passengers choose to travel on the company's vessels. Unfortunately, the company does not have enough vessels to meet the demand. Recently, the company and its branch offices along the Yangtze River have experienced extreme crowding of passengers booking cabins and purchasing tickets before each vessel arrives at the port, and supply cannot meet demand. The company regrets that it cannot meet the needs of its customers.</p>
<h3>Forging Loan Documents and Extortion: Gu Pingzhen and Others Sentenced</h3>
<p>The wealthy elderly widow Ms. Yin, residing in Xicang Bridge in the city, was recently sued in the local court by Gu Pingzhen, a Baoshan native who runs the Baoli Hosiery Factory, for a loan of 100,000 yuan and interest of 10,000 yuan. Gu claimed that in 1920, Ms. Yin, with her eldest son-in-law He Shuhe (the owner of the bankrupt Xiaodongmen He Hengchang Silk and Satin Shop) as guarantor and her other son-in-law Cheng Qizhi (an employee of Samsung Jewelry) as intermediary, borrowed the money from Gu's grandmother, Gu Gongshi. Before her death, Gu Gongshi entrusted the loan to Gu, hence the request for repayment.</p>
<p>However, Ms. Yin stated that she had never met the Gu family and had no financial dealings with them. She also claimed that she was quite wealthy and would not have needed to borrow money in 1920. She also stated that she used to give each of her sons-in-law 50 yuan per month, but recently stopped the payments due to tenant rent arrears and vacant houses, which angered them. Additionally, the Yongji Company house in Tianxi Lane, Zhengjia Bridge, was entrusted to Cheng Qizhi to collect rent, but since the end of last year, the task was transferred to Lawyer Xu. Cheng Qizhi refused to hand over all documents. After mediation by relatives and friends, he handed over the documents after being paid 1,700 yuan. Three days later, this lawsuit arose. Therefore, she hired Lawyer Fang Junjie to file a lawsuit in the criminal court against Gu Pingzhen, He Shuhe, and Cheng Qizhi for forging private documents with the intent to defraud. Judge Wu Xiangzu suspended the hearing. The defendants hired Lawyer Wu to defend them. Gu Pingzhen, He Shuhe, and Cheng Qizhi were initially detained. Cheng was later released on bail with a large guarantee from his employer, Samsung Jewelry. Gu and He remained in custody.</p>
<p>The plaintiff presented Gu Pingzhen's uncle, Gu Wenhua, as a witness, who testified that his mother, before her death, only instructed her descendants to be cautious and not to tarnish the family's reputation, and never handed over any loan documents. Furthermore, the judge had calligrapher Wang Xishen authenticate the loan document. The handwriting was similar to that of He Shuhe. An investigation also revealed that the stamp on the loan document, as verified by the city chamber of commerce, was from 1933. The case was thus clarified, and the debate was declared closed. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu held a court session and sentenced Cheng Qizhi in absentia. Gu Pingzhen and He Shuhe were brought to the court, and after briefly questioning their ages and backgrounds, the judge read out the verdict: Gu Pingzhen was sentenced to two years of imprisonment for jointly forging documents with the intent to illegally possess property and to harm the public or others. He Shuhe and Cheng Qizhi were each sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment for the same actions. After the verdict, the defendants and their lawyers requested that Gu Pingzhen and He Shuhe be released on bail, but the judge denied the request and ordered them to be returned to custody. The defendants immediately announced their intention to appeal and hired Lawyer Sha Xunyi to handle the appeal to the higher court of the second instance.</p>
<h3>Robbers Unsuccessful in Robbery: Shot and Killed an Indian Constable, Robbers Jumped into Yu Songjun's Car and Speeded Away on a Escape Run</h3>
<p>At around 10 AM yesterday, three robbers suddenly entered the home of Dr. Liu Yixiang, an ophthalmologist residing at No. 6 Maurice Villas on Racecourse Road, and attempted to rob the place with guns. Liu, seeing the intruders' ill intentions, immediately fled to the third floor and took refuge in No. 8 next door. Liu's wife tightly closed the door to the third floor and shouted "Catch the robbers!" from the window facing Racecourse Road. The robbers, realizing the situation was unfavorable, did not dare to act and turned to flee eastward.</p>
<p>At that time, Constable No. 189, stationed at the intersection of Mohawk Road, had heard the alarm and rushed over. Seeing the three robbers coming towards him, he bravely stepped forward and grabbed one of them. The other two robbers, seeing their accomplice being arrested, immediately fired their guns, shooting Constable No. 189 in both shoulders and chest. He fell to the ground, wounded. The captured robber also managed to escape. The other two robbers fled towards the Xiaocai Market on Dagu Road, passed through Rue Edouard VII, crossed Rue de Tientsin, and reached Avenue Foch. By this time, the French Concession police had received the information and were closely pursuing the robbers.</p>
<p>In their panic, the two robbers suddenly saw a car parked in front of No. 145 Avenue Foch. Without asking any questions, they opened the car door, forced the occupant out of the car, jumped inside, and ordered the driver at gunpoint to drive west. The driver had no choice but to obey. At the same time, the two robbers fired two more shots at the pursuers from the car. After the car passed Rue Petain and Rue de l'Eglise and reached the front of Tongde Pawnshop at No. 83 Rue du Pere Froc, the two robbers finally ordered the car to stop, jumped out, and fled west. The car driver, unable to think of any other solution, turned the car back to Avenue Foch and reported the incident to the French police station.</p>
<p>It was then learned that the car belonged to obstetrician Yu Songjun. He was on his way to pick up a female doctor to assist in a delivery at No. 11 Route des Soeurs when the robbers hijacked the car. The injured constable died from his wounds. His body was transferred to the Chinese Police Hospital. The police are preparing a grand funeral for him and have ordered all personnel to cooperate in the arrest of the escaped robbers.</p>
<h3>Overcrowded Courtroom with Men and Women: Corpse-in-a-Box Case Continued Yesterday, Police Lawyer Narrated the Murder Process, Mao and Jiang, the Two Murderers, Retracted Confessions, Court to Chemically Examine the Murder Weapon and Powder</h3>
<p>Mao A'gen, driver of the No. 650 car at the Xinzha Fire Station, Jiang Yuanying, firefighter No. 231 at the Central Fire Station, and Lin Gendi, a waitress at the Xianshi Amusement Park, are suspected of jointly killing Cai Ying, a waitress at the Daxin Amusement Park, at No. 3 Cunfu Lane, Baobao Road, on August 9th, dismembering her body, and abandoning it. The case is under investigation by Huang Fusen, Liu Zhaonian, Chen Defu, and Deng Shu, detectives of the Hongkou Police Station, who arrested Mao and others and sent them to the First Special District Court for repeated interrogations, as previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhong Qing of the First Special District Court continued the hearing in the third criminal court. The men and women in the audience were extremely crowded.</p>
<p>The large third criminal court was nearly impossible to stand in, and many people were excluded from the courtroom. First, Police Lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated that the police are now prosecuting the case under Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law for murder and Article 247 for abandoning a corpse. Since the court adjourned the hearing, Mao A'gen has confessed everything to the police. He stated that they had agreed beforehand to start from the Xinzha Fire Station on the 9th. The rattan box used to contain the corpse was given to Mao A'gen by Jiang Yuanying on the 8th for 6 yuan. Mao then went to Sanyou Box Store at No. 292 Avenue Edouard VII and bought the rattan box for 2.8 yuan. Jiang Yuanying brought his own ax. Mao, being a driver, did not have an ax.</p>
<p>So Mao stole the ax used by the foreign supervisor. He also bought a large bag of lime and disinfectants from Xie Da Stone Store on Avenue Avener for 1 Jiao, and placed them in the box. After killing Cai Ying, Gendi bought a reed mat and put the head in it. Then he used a blanket to wipe away all the blood. After dismembering the corpse, he put it in the box and locked the door. They then went out together. That evening, Mao and Lin went to the Zhonghua Xieji New Hotel at No. 387 Avenue Avener and opened room No. 31, writing "No. 690, 32 years old, patrolman" in the register. At 6:45 AM on the 11th, they went to Cunfu Lane.</p>
<p>Took the box out</p>
<p>Hired a rickshaw and first went to Zhapu Road Bridge, where they threw the head into the river. Then they went east to the entrance of No. 79 Suzhou Road, where they got off and abandoned the box. The police investigated the Sanyou Box Store and confirmed that the box was indeed sold by the store, but they did not know who bought it. The police obtained another box similar to the one used to contain the corpse, which has also been brought to court today. The ax stolen by Mao from the foreign supervisor has also been found. There are spots on the ax, which appear to be blood stains, but cannot be determined until they have been chemically examined. The police investigated the Daxin Amusement Park and found that there was indeed</p>
<p>A Cai Ying</p>
<p>On the list of waitresses, but there was actually another person with that name. The deceased did not work at the amusement park every day, so she was not an official waitress and there was no photo of her. Ye Kuiyu, the caretaker of Cunfu Lane, stated that No. 3 was an empty house, which was an attempt to avoid responsibility. It was also reported that a firefighter from No. 211 said that he had heard a firefighter from No. 389 mention that he had seen Jiang Yuanying washing bloody clothes after August 9th, but when questioned, the firefighter from No. 389 denied it. Before Lin Gendi had an affair with Mao A'gen, she had an affair with No. 561 and had opened a room four times. Today, the bellboy from Zhonghua Hotel has also been brought to court and should be questioned by the court." The court immediately</p>
<p>To Mao A'gen</p>
<p>Questioned him. He stated that he met Lin Gendi in late June and had opened a room at the Zhonghua Hotel twice, but not on August 9th. He was only 27 years old, not 32. He did not know Cai Ying and had not killed her. He was being framed. His confession to the police was only because he could not bear the torture and had to admit to it. Police Lawyer Zhang immediately stated that although there was a Chinese police officer from No. 650 in the police station, he was already 50 years old. Chen Jinrong, the bellboy from Zhonghua Hotel, testified that Mao came to open room No. 31 on August 9th, and a woman came to stay with him, but he did not know if the woman was Lin Gendi. When questioned, Lin Gendi insisted that she stayed with Mao at the Zhonghua Hotel on the 9th,</p>
<p>Killed Cai Ying</p>
<p>The date was definitely the 8th. She had opened a room with Mao three times before and after. After the incident, Mao promised to give her some of the deceased's clothes, but she didn't want them. He promised to make her a new dress, but he hasn't given it to her yet. At that time, Mao and others wiped all the blood stains from the blanket, then took the deceased's clothes, more than ten pieces, in a package. This was definitely because the deceased's spirit possessed her and told her to seek revenge, so she revealed the matter on the road to others, and did not intentionally frame Mao and Jiang. Mao A'gen still firmly denied it and said that the box was not bought by him, but was taken by the detectives to various box stores to find a similar box, and he had never touched the ax of the foreign supervisor. When questioned, Jiang Yuanying suddenly retracted his previous testimony, saying that it was because Gendi kept insisting on the</p>
<p>Severe Penalty</p>
<p>Had to admit it. The reason Gendi framed him was because Gendi got into a fight with a tourist at the Xinxin Company one day and he drove her out. Mao's lawyer, Fan, then presented a newspaper, saying that Dr. Ge Futing of the Public Works Department had published that the murder of the corpse occurred within 14 hours, so the case should be sent to a forensic doctor again for examination. The court ordered that the ax handle obtained by the police and the colored powder obtained at the scene should be chemically examined. The court ordered that the case be postponed to the afternoon of October 1st for further hearing and that the obtained items be sent to the Forensic Research Institute for further identification.</p>
<h3>Counterfeit Currency Den Located in Guo Ren Lane, Wangzhi Road: Eight Male and Female Criminals Arrested, Police to Investigate Before Prosecuting</h3>

<h3>Executive Yuan Responds to National Goods Association: Raincloth Should Reduce Costs, The Way to Compete with Foreign Goods, Increasing Import Tax Rates is Pending</h3>
<p>The China National Goods Maintenance Association, at the request of the Lianpu Waterproof Fabric Factory, presented documents to the National Government, Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Industry on June 26, requesting that all agencies be ordered to use domestic raincloth and increase import tax rates on foreign raincoats and fabrics to promote national goods. The association received a reply from the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan, No. 6693, stating: "The President has ruled that the case of the China National Goods Maintenance Association's request to increase import tax rates on foreign raincoat fabrics should be reviewed by the Ministry of Finance, and the original presenters should be informed." Accordingly, a copy of the original document is enclosed for your reference. Addressed to the China National Goods Maintenance Association. Enclosed is a copy of the original letter from the Ministry of Finance. Secretary-General Weng Wenhao of the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>The original letter from the Ministry of Finance states: "Received letter No. 5009 dated July 6, this year, opening with 'The President has ruled that 'the China National Goods Maintenance Association presented on June 16th of the fifteenth year, to distinguish between domestic raincoats, paintcloth, and other products and non-domestic goods, requesting that all agencies thoroughly investigate merchants who cover up and use foreign goods to impersonate domestic goods, hindering the development of domestic goods, ordering the use of domestic products, and increasing the import tax rates of foreign raincoats and fabrics to promote them, should be submitted to the Ministry of Finance and Industry for review and instructions be issued.'' In addition to the President's instructions and separate letters, a copy of the original document is enclosed for your reference." Regarding the original request to increase the import tax rates on foreign raincoat paintcloth, the Mountain National Tariff Committee has been instructed to investigate and review it. After further review, the Ministry found that the lowest market price of foreign cotton raincoat fabrics in Shanghai is 4 Jiao per unit, and the cost is at most 2 Jiao per unit. The cost of domestic goods is nearly 1 Jiao per yard for the blank fabric, and at least 3 Jiao for processing, totaling 5 Jiao. Comparing the two, the price of each yard differs by 1 Jiao. It is clear that domestic raincoat fabrics will not be able to compete with foreign goods unless they strive to reduce costs in manufacturing. The import tax rate for foreign raincoat fabrics is currently levied at 25% ad valorem. The request to increase the tax rate should be considered when the tariff is revised in the future. With the approval of the previous letter, we hereby reply to your office for reference and submission. Addressed to the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan, Kong Xiangxi.</p>

<h3>Assassination of Shao Wenbin Case: Two Suspects Claim Frame-Up, Firmly Deny Charges Despite Court Confrontation, Ordered to be Held in Detention Center for Rescheduled Trial</h3>
<p>Shao Wenbin, the "Flower Association King" from Pudong, also known as "Driver Sixth," was shot and killed on the evening of July 28, 1933, at the intersection of Avenue Wagner and Rue de la Mairie in the French Concession. Subsequently, the French police arrested the suspect, Zhang Bingrong, a Ningbo native nicknamed "Little Ningbo," and handed him over to the Second Special District Court for prosecution. The initial trial sentenced him to 15 years in prison, but the High Court's Third Branch overturned the verdict and sentenced him to life imprisonment. During the trial, Zhang confessed that Wang Shilong, who was at large, had conspired with him to carry out the assassination. The court issued an arrest warrant for Wang Shilong, and he was finally apprehended by the French police and handed over to the Second Special District Court.</p>
<p>Custody and Investigation</p>
<p>According to the case file, during the investigation, Wang confessed to accomplices Qian Ajin and Ma Pi Ajin. Qian was also arrested, and the cases were merged for investigation. This has already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Wang Gangxu of the Second Special District Court, accompanied by clerk Gao Yan, conducted a preliminary hearing in the First Criminal Court. Attorney Gu Shouxi from the Police Department presented the case, stating that the Police Department was now prosecuting the defendants Wang Shilong and Qian Ajin under Article 271 of the Criminal Law for murder, and Articles 267 and 268 for intent to profit and engaging in illegal flower association gambling. He stated that after the victim, Shao Wenbin, was assassinated on the evening of July 28, 1933, the police</p>
<p>Arrested the Murderer</p>
<p>Zhang Bingrong, who was sentenced to life imprisonment by the court. According to Zhang's confession, Wang Shilong had arranged a meeting at the Yuebin Hotel to discuss the plan, inviting Zhang Bingrong, Li Landi, Si Gen, Chen Changgeng, and others to kill Shao. Wang also discovered that Shao passed by Rue de la Mairie and Avenue Wagner every evening after leaving the Far Eastern Hotel. On the evening of July 28, they carried out the murder. Now Wang has confessed to the assassination in the police station and implicated Qian Ajin, requesting that they be interrogated according to the law. Wang Shilong and Qian Ajin both denied participating in the conspiracy to assassinate Shao Wenbin and claimed they did not know Shao. Wang also claimed he had a feud with Zhang Bingrong because Zhang had sent him an invitation, and when he didn't send a gift, Zhang demanded the invitation back.</p>
<p>Verbal Quarrel</p>
<p>He hit me, and I held a grudge and bit him. I did not participate. My confession at the police station was only due to unbearable suffering. I confessed nonsense. Qian claimed that he did not confess to participating in Shao's murder at the police station, only admitting to being a lookout for the flower association, but stopped when he didn't get paid. Now he is being falsely accused. Both defendants hired Wu Kaisheng, Huang Xiubo, and Wang Shou'an as their lawyers. The court wanted to present Zhang Bingrong as a witness, but it was already near noon, and there was no time for questioning. The hearing was adjourned until 2 p.m. In the afternoon, at 3 p.m., Judge Wang continued the trial at the Criminal Court and first questioned the witness Zhang Bingrong, who testified that he had not participated in the assassination of Shao Wenbin.</p>
<p>Wrongful Arrest</p>
<p>Sentenced to life imprisonment. I knew Wang Shilong before. He asked me to go to the Chunjiang Hotel and meet Chen Changgeng. Chen recommended me to work as a tea server at Cao Awu's house. At Cao's house, I heard Cao Awu, Zhao Liansheng (Cao's son-in-law), Li Landi, and another person I didn't recognize discussing killing Shao Wenbin. Wang Shilong was not present. I did not know Qian Ajin either. Later, Chen Changgeng told me that he, Li Landi, Si Gen, Xiao Mao, and others had gone to kill Shao because of</p>
<p>Robbing Flower Associations</p>
<p>I have no deep hatred for Wang Shilong, but reflecting back, I was arrested because I met Wang Shilong. He asked me to go to the Chunjiang Hotel and meet Chen Changgeng, who asked me to work as a tea server. That's why I implicated Wang Shilong. The court then questioned Wang Shilong and Qian Ajin again, who still vehemently denied killing Shao. After repeated confrontations, Wang and Qian continued to deny the charges. As a result, the court ordered a postponement until October 1 for further interrogation. The defendants were ordered to be held in the detention center.</p>

<h3>Shanghai West Civic Education Experimental Zone: Training Model Rickshaw Pullers, Imparting Basic Knowledge, Correcting Behavioral Errors</h3>
<p>The Shanghai West Civic Education Experimental Zone, recognizing that most rickshaw pullers have not received adequate education, which sometimes leads to unreasonable behavior, is launching a training program for model rickshaw pullers to eliminate negative attitudes. Yesterday, the first training session was held at the General Counseling Office on Zhongshan Road. The event was very enthusiastic. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Crowded Attendance</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Director Tang Mao of the zone, Director Ling Zhiying of the Rural Department, Director Xu Shuquan of the Urban Department, Counselor Lou Jiaji and staff Zhou Congyi of the Twenty-Second Community of the Xujiahui District, and over fifty hardworking rickshaw pullers, including Qu Chunlin, Xue Hongshan, Wu Huanchun, Zhu Zengtai, Qu Fengqi, Sha Changchun, and Jiang Dengshan, attended the training session. Under the direction of Urban Department Director Xu Shuquan, the training began as the sun set. Discipline was strictly enforced.</p>
<p>Preliminary Training</p>
<p>(1) Training on Meeting Procedures: A. Singing the Party Song, B. Saluting, C. Reading the Will, D. Silent Meditation; (2) Basic Civil Rights: A. Proposals, B. Explanations, C. Discussions, D. Voting; (3) Mutual Teaching and Learning: A. Men and women, young and old, love each other, B. Relatives, neighbors, and friends, help each other, C. Building roads benefits everyone, D. Cleaning up filth serves the public. Following this, the directors of each department delivered speeches. The meeting ended around 9 p.m.</p>
<p>Summary of Speeches: (1) Director Tang Mao of the zone delivered a speech, stating: "Chinese people only know how to eat, work, and pursue their own happiness, and are unwilling to cooperate with others for common benefit. Now we must 'cooperate to survive.' We must organize the Twenty-Two Communities, implement joint management under the principle of cooperative production, improve the lives of the masses, and achieve the goals of 'everyone doing their best,' 'everyone enjoying the fruits of their labor,' 'everything being used to its full potential,' and 'everything yielding its benefits.' So, how can one be a member of the Twenty-Two Communities? As long as one has (1) sound character, (2) a spirit of cooperation, (3) abundant knowledge, and (4) good habits, one can be a community member and a good community member is a good citizen. Therefore, if a person can understand the meaning of 'cooperation' and the relationship between 'people and people,' it will be easy to follow the twelve covenants below: (1) Wear homespun cloth, (2) Use domestic goods, (3) Do not smoke, (4) Do not gamble, (5) Work diligently, (7) Spend frugally, (8) Do good deeds, (9) Love cleanliness, (10) Value hygiene, (11) Be friendly to neighbors, (12) Help each other." (2) General Director Lou spoke on "Model Rickshaw Puller Guidelines," stating: "A model rickshaw puller is one whose words and actions can serve as an example for other rickshaw pullers. Of course, a perfect model rickshaw puller cannot be achieved immediately, so we have temporarily stipulated a few points: (1) Be able to comply with the covenants stipulated by this zone, and be confirmed by the zone's investigation; (2) Receive the most votes in the model rickshaw puller general election; (3) Be confirmed as good by local police officers and passengers." B. The Creation of Model Rickshaw Pullers: (1) Performance in fulfilling covenants accounts for 50%; (2) Election votes account for 30%; (3) Social evaluation accounts for 20%. C. Rights of Model Rickshaw Pullers: (1) The right to request small loans from this zone; (2) The right to request treatment, introduction to treatment, and learning treatment from this zone; (3) The right to request assistance with legal matters from this zone." D. Obligations of Model Rickshaw Pullers: (1) The obligation to obey all orders of this zone; (2) The obligation to guide and report the lives and behaviors of other rickshaw pullers; (3) The obligation to implement the zone's pre-set covenants and various collaborations, and to serve as a model for other rickshaw pullers." (3) Director Ling of the Rural Department spoke on "Methods from Rickshaw Pulling Cooperation to Animal Husbandry Cooperation," stating: "Rickshaw pulling is too simple, and life is very difficult. We should utilize the free time of housewives and children to adjust family work and increase production. Animal husbandry in the family should focus on livestock that are easy to raise and produce a large yield, such as Angora rabbits, chickens, and ducks. If this is organized with the funds of all the members, it will definitely achieve twice the result with half the effort."</p>
<h3>Public Concession to Have Two Parking Lots, Municipal Council to Set Up Free Parking Lot</h3>
<p>According to a translation of a mainland newspaper by a foreign news agency, before the implementation of the Municipal Council's new parking regulations on October 15, Shanghai will have two large parking lots. It is also rumored that a real estate company plans to open a third parking lot. One will be located between Fuzhou Road and Henan Road, at the former site of the Central Police Station, which will be leased by the Municipal Council to a business for operation, and a small portion will be set aside for a gas company to set up a branch. The second will be located between Central Road and Xinkang Road, operated by the Shanghai Land Company. The monthly rent for the first lot will be about five to eight yuan, and the rent for the second lot will be seven yuan for cars and three yuan for chartered cars. The first lot was put out for lease in August, and three companies have submitted bids. The decision will be made soon, and the parking facilities should be completed by October 15. The first lot will have space for 90 vehicles, and it is expected to be ready in early October. It is said that half of the spaces have already been reserved by car owners. In addition, the company will hire guards to watch the lot, and car owners can request that their vehicles be driven to the office. It is also rumored that various car companies and gas stations are planning to build parking lots. The Municipal Council is also setting up a free parking lot between Jiujiang Road and Beijing Road, which can accommodate 116 cars. This is the only free parking lot currently under construction in Shanghai. If needed in the future, it is planned to build another lot along the Suzhou Creek. In total, there will be three parking lots, although only one offers free parking, it can accommodate 300 vehicles. According to a report from the Police Department, after the implementation of the new parking regulations, 350 vehicles will no longer be able to park for free. However, the British-owned Public Bus Company claims that the number is closer to 500. Therefore, the company is drafting a protest against the Municipal Council's implementation of the new regulations.</p>

<h3>Fine Arts Association's Art Exhibition Opens Today</h3>

<h3>Inheritance Dispute Loses Third Appeal, Hu Seeks Revenge, Writes Threats and Throws Excrement, Hu Ji'an Suffers Intolerable Harassment</h3>
<p>Hu Ganqing, a native of Hangzhou, Zhejiang, was extensively involved in business in Shanghai, including shares in Hu Qingyutang on Beijing Road, Fuchang Ginseng Shop in the South City, Zhang Yongchang Hardware Store on Wuhu Road, and Xinlisha Restaurant on Simalu Road. However, since Hu's death, all the stock certificates of the various stores and the residence at No. 132 Guling Road have been inherited and managed by his son, Hu Ji'an. Since then, the family has experienced many problems and incessant litigation. The son of a Mr. Li, a bookkeeper in the Hu residence, filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Court's Criminal Division last September 16 in the name of Hu Sheng, accusing Hu Ji'an of embezzlement, claiming that Hu Sheng was the adopted son of the late Hu Ganqing, who had been forced to live in Suzhou since the age of eight or nine, and that now that Ganqing had passed away, all the inheritance had been embezzled by Hu Ji'an. However, after the trial, Hu Sheng lost all three appeals, and the verdict was final. Unexpectedly, Hu Sheng refused to repent and, since May of last year, repeatedly pestered Hu Ji'an for loans. This year, he even wrote a threatening letter with harsh words and threats to Hu Ji'an's life. Hu Ji'an reported this to the Old Gate Police Station and requested that the First Special District Court issue an arrest warrant. On the night of the 18th of this month, Hu Sheng took a can of excrement to the door of Hu Ji'an's home at No. 132 Guling Road and threw it, and posted a notice on the door, declaring that the person throwing the excrement was your brother, in intimidating language. At 6:05 p.m. the day before yesterday, Hu Sheng went to the Xinlisha Restaurant on Guangxi Road, intending to make trouble, and was arrested by Chinese detectives Zhang Yuanjing, Li Shugui, Xue Youwen, etc., and taken to the Old Gate Police Station. Yesterday morning, they were handed over to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police Attorney Jiang Baoqi charged Hu Sheng with obstructing freedom under Article 305 of the Criminal Law. According to Hu Ji'an's complaint, the defendant Hu Sheng confessed that he had someone else write the threatening letter and that he had thrown the excrement. Judge Dai verified the confession and ordered the case to be adjourned until next Thursday for further hearing. The defendant was returned to police custody.</p>
<h3>Lu Zhangde Sued by Siblings for Embezzling Inheritance, Investigation into Sale of Landed Property to be Made Through Registered Foreign Firm</h3>
<p>Lu Zhangde, residing at No. 75 Jessfield Road, possesses substantial assets in inheritance. Recently, his brother Lu Zhangci and sister Lu Fengqin filed a lawsuit against him in the First Special District Court, accusing him of embezzling inheritance. According to the plaintiff's statement, their legal mother, Wu, being childless, adopted the son of her late husband Zhongfu's aunt, Wang (i.e., the defendant), as her heir. Subsequently, Zhongfu remarried Zhao, who was also childless, and then married Liu, who gave birth to Fengzhu, Zhangren, and Zhangliang. Then, he married Ding, who gave birth to the plaintiff siblings. During his lifetime, Zhongfu served as the manager of the real estate department of the British firm Telier &amp; Co. for decades, accumulating substantial wealth. On November 14, 1926, Zhongfu passed away, leaving behind over 100,000 yuan in cash and a considerable amount of real estate. Initially, the defendant managed the assets, deciding to entrust the management of the real estate to the stepmother, Zhao. On October 7, 1931, Zhao passed away, and all the inheritance was managed entirely by the defendant. In January of this year, the defendant, having depleted the cash left by Zhongfu, proposed dividing the property and living separately, and insisted on receiving a larger share. The plaintiffs agreed to his proposal, and a division contract was signed. It was discovered that since Lu's property had been managed by the defendant, there had never been any public accounting of income and expenses. It was recently learned that among Zhongfu's inheritance was a plot of land of 3 mu, 5 fen, 2 li, and 4 hao located at the corner of Guiyang Road in Yangshupu, which the defendant had embezzled and pocketed the proceeds from. The defendant, being an adopted son, had no right to inherit according to the laws at the time. The plaintiffs were unwilling to engage in fraternal strife and had always tacitly acknowledged him as one of Lu's heirs. However, the defendant completely disregarded his conscience and arbitrarily embezzled the inheritance, constituting a crime under Article 335, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Therefore, they specially requested to be prosecuted. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Pan Zhenyang summoned the plaintiff Lu Zhangci, who explained the circumstances and stated that the defendant had secretly sold the real estate on Guiyang Road, which is now worth 70,000 yuan. Furthermore, it has been discovered that seven other titles to land have also been secretly sold. The plaintiffs submitted the title deeds and a ledger of the total title deeds to the court, requesting a thorough investigation. The defendant Lu Zhangde testified that the real estate was sold by Zhao and the other two mothers, and that he had never sold an inch of land after taking over the management. Judge Pan stated that the seller of the real estate should be investigated through the registered foreign firm to clarify the matter. He then adjourned the hearing until the afternoon of the 30th of this month.</p>
<h3>Tongyi Debtor Meeting Fails, Bank Debtor Meeting to Be Held Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The creditors' meeting of Tongyi Trust Company failed to reach a quorum previously, so the attendants requested the chairman to set another date, and to convene the savings and bank portions separately. At nine am on the morning of the 23rd, the savings creditors meeting at the Lake Society Hall was attended by creditors and representatives numbering three hundred and representing 1737 accounts with a total value of 1.67 million yuan. Due to the lack of a legal quorum, the judge from the court appointed as the chairman, Jiang Gongliang, announced that the meeting had failed. The attendants expressed considerable doubt about the quorum and were particularly concerned that the meeting could not be successfully held, so they spoke up one after another. Then, lawyer Zhang Yifan, representing a portion of the rights holders, applied to the chairman, asking that in order to protect the benefit of the creditors and to quickly move ahead with the bankruptcy law, that they move ahead with the electronic election procedure to elect inspectors as quickly as possible. This was greeted with applause and endorsement by the entire hall. However, since the chair must have a written request, a written request would be made to the bankruptcy administrator to request the court to administer this procedure. The meeting adjourned at noon. The banking creditors meeting scheduled to be held at the same venue on the 25th will be held as usual.</p>

<h3>Unregistered Smokers - Specially Allowed to Voluntarily Apply for Cessation - If Still Unrepentant... Investigation and Military Law Will Be Applied</h3>
<p>Since the general inspection of smokers has ended, those unregistered smokers who voluntarily apply for cessation will be given special consideration. Those who remain unrepentant will be punished according to the law once discovered. Door-to-door inspections of smokers will be conducted, and each district will mobilize its personnel to begin. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Special Permission for Cessation</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau states that since the general inspection of smokers in this city ended on September 10th, there have been quite a few who have voluntarily applied for cessation. However, the Smoking Prohibition Regulations do not explicitly state whether to accept applications or impose penalties. Therefore, the Municipal Government specially requested the Military Commission's General Supervision Department for Smoking Prohibition to provide an interpretation. Afterwards, to give smokers a chance to repent and reform, smokers who have not registered but voluntarily apply for cessation will be given special consideration and will not be penalized. However, if they remain unrepentant, they will be punished according to military law once discovered, without leniency.</p>
<p>Mobilization for Inspection</p>
<p>After the completion of the procedures for smokers' household pledges and guarantees, the Municipal Public Security Bureau immediately ordered each district station to conduct door-to-door inspections based on the pledge forms filled out by each household. Each district station has already dispatched police to mobilize. If there are suspicious households with sallow complexions and blackened teeth, they will be questioned in detail. If it is confirmed that they are addicted and have not registered, they will be punished according to the law.</p>

Yesterday at 9:00 AM, she hired a rickshaw to go to the South Railway Station to take the train back to her hometown. While passing the intersection of Fumin Road, Dananmen, a robber suddenly jumped out from the roadside, snatched a pair of gold earrings worth over 20 yuan, and fled. Ms. Zhang cried out for help. Zhu San, a coppersmith, happened to be passing by and bravely chased after the robber to the Jinjia flagpole lane in Hejia Lane. With the help of the police officer on duty, the robber was caught and taken to the Wenmiao Road Police Station. He confessed his name as Yang Jinbiao and admitted to the robbery. After verification, the police station determined that the robbery occurred in broad daylight, which was despicable. In addition to returning the stolen items to the victim, the suspect Yang was transferred to the Public Security Bureau for severe punishment.</p>
<h3>Polish Female Reporter, Su Aisi, Arrives in Shanghai - Xu Xingchu Hosts a Banquet Yesterday - Introduces Her to the Local Press</h3>

She arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. Dr. Xu Xingchu, honorary secretary of the China-Italy Cultural Association, who was a correspondent for Shen Bao and Xin Bao in Europe, knew Ms. Su well in Geneva.

<h3>A Frugal Wedding</h3>
<p>Mr. Feng Bingnan, a business magnate in Shanghai, held a wedding ceremony for his third son on the 10th of this month. To save money and time, Mr. Feng specifically stated three points in his invitation cards: first, he originally intended to decline all gifts, but if relatives and friends insisted on giving something, please send cash only, but each gift should not exceed ten yuan in national currency; second, there would be no wedding hall for the wedding ceremony, and congratulations would be declined; third, in addition to preparing refreshments on the afternoon of the auspicious day to entertain guests, there would be no separate banquet, and the funds saved from the banquet, together with the cash gifts from relatives and friends, would be donated to the Shanghai Renji Hospital and Sacred Heart Hospital for the purpose of helping the poor and sick. This approach not only reduces the various formalities of the wedding ceremony but also benefits the poor and sick. Therefore, although many guests gathered that afternoon and the road was crowded with carriages and horses, the order was well maintained and both the host and guests were happy. It was truly the simplest and most frugal wedding ceremony, which is worthy of emulation by the general public during this time of economic depression.</p>

<p>Couple's Knowledge</p>

<h3>An Impartial Discussion of Infertility Between the Sexes</h3>
<p>……Using a medical mind to clarify the responsibilities……Using scientific methods to point out a path to success</p>
<p>If a couple does not have children after three years of marriage, it will inevitably cause trouble between the couple, and rifts within the family will inevitably begin to brew. However, according to medical theory, there are no infertile women or infertile men in the world, except for those with infertility-related illnesses. However, if one is truly suffering from infertility, one should determine whose fault it is, and it is a great mistake to blame the wife alone.</p>
<p>Therefore, young couples who have been married for two or three years and have not yet conceived should first consult a reputable specialist physician to confirm the cause. If the responsibility lies with the man or the woman, the respective party should seek countermeasures.</p>
<p>The causes of infertility in men can be simply stated as: (1) penile malformation; (2) testicular hypoplasia. However, these conditions are limited to a small number of cases, and the most common cause is gonorrhea, which leads to the loss of reproductive ability. In particular, diseases like venereal disease are often transmitted by men to women, causing diseases of the uterus, fallopian tubes, or ovaries in the wife, resulting in lifelong infertility.</p>
<p>In addition, the most common and frequent causes of infertility in men are impotence and premature ejaculation, which are purely due to lack of internal secretion and decline of the reproductive glands. However, the causes of infertility in women are not all due to men. It is not all due to venereal disease affecting reproductive function. Various other reasons can lead to infertility, mainly: uterine hypoplasia, ovarian hypoplasia, menstrual irregularities, etc. Therefore, infertility is due to physical ailments. To worship superstition and seek pregnancy is all in vain. Professor Holmes of the Physiological College of the University of California, USA, delivered a world-renowned fertility speech at the Second International Congress of Eugenics in New York. He faithfully indicated a gonadotropic hormone preparation "Shengzhi Su" for the remedy of premature ejaculation and impotence in men. He clarified that gonadotropin is of great benefit to infertile men, not only making men energetic and eliminating sexual neurasthenia. If women suffer from menstrual irregularities, uterine and ovarian hypoplasia, they can take the female "Shengzhi Su." He highly praised Dr. Steiner, the Austrian physiologist who invented "Shengzhi Su." He gave a global academic lecture, believing that men and women who lost fertility due to gonorrhea must take the yellow pigment and vaccine combination preparation "Anti-Gonorrhea" invented by the German Dr. Jettelson. I have cured a sexually impotent young man after marriage in the United States with "Shengzhi Su" and cured a Russian merchant with chronic gonorrhea with "Anti-Gonorrhea". Later, both of them had children, which is a powerful proof for those who have been cut off from offspring.</p>
<h3>Interview with the World's Most Beautiful Woman</h3>
<p>— Interviewer: Barees, Reporter of the Small Paris Morning News, Excerpted by Dr. Zhou Xiaohan</p>
<p>She said that the breasts are the necessary lifeline for a woman's fitness and beauty and are the foundation of a woman's lifelong health. It cannot be ignored. High breasts are the most beautiful focus of 20th-century women. Ladies of the era, no matter how beautiful your appearance is or how beautiful your clothes are, you must not neglect the development of your breasts. This is the key to your success and the trend of the times. Ms. Kellemann of Germany, who has standard beauty, is the most fit and beautiful woman in the world who meets the standard of beauty. The lady's measurements are: breast height is 3.5 inches, chest circumference is 35.2 inches, hip circumference is 27.8 inches, and thigh circumference is 22.2 inches. A.D. Barees, a reporter from the Small Paris Morning News in France, made a public visit to her residence. The findings of the visit were published in The Women News. It is said: "Ms. Kellemann, who has the authority on fitness and beauty, is a woman with a beautiful appearance and high breasts. She is 21 years old this year. Her breasts are firm and soft, and her plump hips form a very natural curve. She studied medicine and went to Austria in 1932 to specialize in cosmetology. She fully applies medical principles to achieve twice the result with half the effort. Her success is deeply based on the theory of Dr. Steiner, a famous Austrian physiologist, and is entirely due to the gonadotropic hormone preparation "Shengzhi Su." Two years ago, her breasts were not high, so she took "Shengzhi Su." After that, her spirit was particularly strong, and her whole body developed rapidly, and her breasts and hips became exceptionally healthy and beautiful."</p>
<p>Chinese women of this era, if you want to find the secret of fitness and beauty, and not be belittled by the opposite sex in social situations, can you not be timid? Perhaps someone will lightly say: "The face is good, but the breasts are too withered, it's really ugly." What will you do? Then you really must not ignore the above record. This is your golden rule.</p>
<h3>Painless Method of Quitting Smoking</h3>
<p>— Physician Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>Generally, smokers have a complacent and僥倖性 mentality. If they are asked to quit smoking, they will regard it as a daunting task. The reason for this is that the pain of quitting smoking is unbearable, because during the withdrawal period, the body will inevitably weaken and diseases are more likely to invade. Symptoms such as insomnia, night sweats, waist and back pain, and mental exhaustion will increase the pain of the quitter and make them unable to resist. Therefore, they are afraid to quit smoking. However, if the tonic withdrawal method can be used during the withdrawal period, and the gonadotropic hormone preparation "Shengzhi Su" is given and Yuk Wei Cibaoming is injected to strengthen the body, it is not difficult to completely quit smoking without pain in a short period of time. Let me illustrate with an example?</p>
<p>Last year, a smoker named Zheng Hongming, who was in his forties, had been smoking for more than ten years. He used to be in politics, and he smoked freely and was deeply addicted. Recently, the deadline for quitting smoking was very strict, but he was unable to do so due to physical weakness. Of course, he was afraid of the pain. Later, I used the tonic withdrawal method to administer "Shengzhi Su" internally and injected Yuk Wei Cibaoming. After a three-month withdrawal period, all his cravings disappeared, and he hated cigarettes when he saw them. He safely quit smoking without pain.</p>
<p>Ms. Kellemann of Germany, who is known worldwide for her fitness and beauty, is surrounded by newspaper reporters. Her fame is no less than that of a politician. Why is that the case?</p>

<h3>The Path to Self-Renewal for Youths Addicted to Masturbation</h3>
<p>— Excerpted from "The Evolution of Sex." By Physician Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>……Describing in detail the various pathological conditions resulting from the harms of masturbation……Treatments for incomplete development, nocturnal emission-related neurasthenia, etc.</p>
<p>Two of the most famous biologists of our time, Mr. Patrick Geddes and Sir Arthur Thomson, in their collaborative scientific masterpiece, "The Evolution of Sex," once published a detailed and practical theory regarding the harms of masturbation for young men and women. It does not cause infertility. However, when these various pathological conditions are about to erupt, it is certain that the preference for masturbation among young men and women is entirely pathological. According to the human body's ability to reproduce healthily, it requires various parts of the body to produce new cells to replace the old cells remaining in the body, so that the limbs, bones, skin, and hair can undergo continuous metabolism and circulation. This does not hinder health and reduces the chances of disease. However, the one that promotes the alternation of these cells must be sufficient in sperm. Young people who masturbate not only cannot make their sperm sufficient but also further waste it because it is entirely automatic sexual indulgence, damaging mental and physical strength ten times more than ordinary sexual intercourse. It can hinder the development of sexual organs; therefore, many people have particularly small genitals as a result. It can cause the body's nutrition to decline; therefore, many people commonly have pale complexions, listlessness, reduced appetite, and stomach disorders. It can cause neurasthenia; therefore, it is difficult to escape tinnitus, headaches, palpitations, insomnia, forgetfulness, and other symptoms. It can damage sexual function; therefore, premature ejaculation, impotence, and infertility can occur. However, when these various pathological conditions are about to erupt, there must be precursor symptoms. The precursor symptom discovered is nocturnal emission. Therefore, masturbation and nocturnal emission become an inseparable connection. Therefore, stopping nocturnal emission is the essential strategy to avoid its various pathological conditions. Therefore, he suggests that those suffering from masturbation should simply find ways to strengthen their will and consolidate their essence. When the will is firm, dreams are naturally fewer, and external temptations are not impulsive; when the essence is consolidated, sperm will realize the above two treatments. The "Schmidt's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" invented by the German venereologist Schmidt should be regarded as our most ideal success. We can speculate from his success that the progress of science is not difficult to approach the highest level.</p>
<p>(Editor's note: It is difficult to invent such a specific drug for the treatment of nocturnal emission, but for neurasthenia, premature ejaculation, and impotence caused by prolonged nocturnal emission, "Reproductive Essence" should be taken, which is the most effective treatment recognized by our medical community.)</p>
<p>Lectures on Venereal Diseases</p>
<p>—Compiled by Dr. Yao Erchang and Dr. Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>(Clinic) 2nd Floor, China Trust Company, Corner of Sichuan Road and Beijing Road (Consultation) 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Closed on Sundays.</p>
<p>There are many types of venereal disease symptoms. The ones that are commonly seen by us include small genitals and the inability to have sexual life, such as premature ejaculation and impotence. If one indulges in excessive sexual activity, the muscles become thin, and the sperm is depleted, it will inevitably affect the health of the whole body, not only easily aging but also often resulting in unhealthy and lively offspring, or even infertility.</p>
<p>Youths' addiction to masturbation is actually the ladder to promote the various sexual diseases mentioned above, especially nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, and incomplete development. In addition, early marriage and polygamy have the same disadvantages as the bad habit of masturbation. According to surveys, urban residents are physically weaker than those living in rural areas. The main reasons are the rampant venereal diseases and the prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases. This is almost a well-known fact. There are also two examples to prove this.</p>
<p>(1) Addiction to Masturbation Hinders Development</p>
<p>Patient Feng Shiyi, 20 years old. He has had a bad habit of masturbation since he was 17 years old, so his overall development is impaired, and his genitals are small and have phimosis. (Chief complaint) - The penis is like a child's. At the age of 19, he realized that it was harmful to his health, so he quit masturbation, but nocturnal emission was difficult to stop, at least four times a week. Therefore, he suffers from abnormal neurasthenia, insomnia, forgetfulness, tinnitus, palpitations, and other symptoms. (Current symptoms) - Poor overall nutrition, pale complexion, thin muscles, incomplete development of genitals, abnormal phimosis, extremely severe deterioration of neurasthenia, the most severe of which is nocturnal emission. (Treatment methods) - Using planar electrotherapy, prostate massage, Dr. Zhan removed the foreskin, and "Schmidt's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" were used to stop his nocturnal emission. At the same time, "Reproductive Essence" was taken to eliminate his neurasthenia and promote development. In less than two months, his development was good, and nocturnal emission and neurasthenia were completely eliminated.</p>
<p>(2) Early Marriage Leads to Childlessness, Impotence, and Premature Ejaculation</p>
<p>Patient Deng Dagui, 31 years old, married at the age of 17. (Main treatment) - Due to marrying too early, he suffered from premature ejaculation, impotence, etc. Therefore, he has not had children after being married for four years. Now, in addition to premature ejaculation and impotence, he also suffers from brain weakness, tinnitus, headaches, insomnia, and other symptoms. (Treatment methods) - In addition to taking "Reproductive Essence" four times a day, he was also injected with "Yu Wei Ci Baoming," and his sexual activity was restricted. After two months, his sexual function became stronger, and impotence and premature ejaculation were completely cured. Deng Junyan was impressed by the effectiveness of "Reproductive Essence" because of his weak body, and it is now used as a perennial tonic, so his wife is already four months pregnant.</p>
<p>Self-Treatment for Stomach Pain</p>
<p>Editor: I suddenly suffered from severe stomach pain four or five years ago. Every morning after meals, I experienced acid reflux and pain like a cut. Seeking medical treatment and taking medicine were completely ineffective. Please give me a good prescription so I can escape the sea of ​​suffering. I am extremely grateful. (Wang Niancheng) (Answer) You can buy "Stomach Pain Relief" from Chinese and Western pharmacies for internal use. The pain will stop immediately, and take "Stomach Strengthening Element" to enhance appetite and aid digestion, which will naturally heal itself.</p>
<p>Radical Cure for Leukorrhea</p>
<p>Editor: Unfortunately, I am suffering from an unspeakable disease - leukorrhea. At first, only a small amount flowed out, but later it became more and more. As a result, I suffered great mental damage, dizziness, insomnia, and decreased physical health. I was extremely anxious. Fortunately, three months ago, I encountered Ms. Li, a childhood classmate, who told me to buy "Leukorrhea Relief" from Wuzhou Pharmacy for external use and "Female Reproductive Essence" for internal use. Now the discharge has been completely cured. It is truly an effective medicine.</p>
<p>Premature Aging</p>
<p>Editor: When I was young, I was very naughty and liked to play with my genitals until ejaculation gave me pleasure. Therefore, I depleted my essence every day and lost my moderation. Now I am thin, my bones are protruding, my face is yellow and bloodless, my hair is white, my back is bent, and I am as old as an old man. Please give me a treatment method. (Deng Zixin)</p>
<p>(Answer) Quickly go to Wuzhou Pharmacy to buy and take "Reproductive Essence" and then have electrotherapy performed by Dr. Zhan Nianceng.</p>
<p>Incomplete Development</p>
<p>Editor: I am a 25-year-old young man. According to my age, I should be a great man, but my body is as short as a child, especially my genitals, which are shaped like ginkgo nuts and are pitifully small. I have lost the joy of life that I should have. Please give me a treatment method. (Shi Da) (Answer) "Reproductive Essence" is the only specific medicine for treating incomplete development. All pharmacies sell it.</p>

<h3>Commercial Rights to Gonorrhea Treatment</h3>

<p>Regarding the treatment of gonorrhea, there has been endless discussion in various medical books and medical circles in various countries. Famous scholars abroad have also worked tirelessly and devoted their efforts to update the treatment methods of gonorrhea so that all previous difficult problems can be completely eliminated. Indeed, the hard work of scientists has benefited patients significantly. When I was studying at the Venereal Disease Hospital of the University of Hong Kong, I had the honor of having Mr. Ladison, a world-renowned British gonorrhea expert, come to the hospital to give a lecture. He said: "He most admired the success of German medical inventions, which is unmatched by any nation in the world, especially the research on gonorrhea drugs, which can overwhelm the world. For example, the combination preparation of yellow pigment and vaccine invented by Dr. Jie Te Sheng, 'Anti-Gonorrhea,' contains ingredients that are indeed unmatched by other drugs. Not only can it penetrate the membrane and kill bacteria, but it also enables countless anti-toxic vaccines to be produced in the blood of the person taking it, directly forcing gonorrhea gonococci to have no way to survive." I had long known the effect of yellow pigment and vaccine in treating gonorrhea, but after obtaining the expert's explanation, I became more trusting. Therefore, in recent years, in the treatment of patients, I have always used "Anti-Gonorrhea" as my main standard drug. As proven by clinical experience, failures are rare. In the winter of last year, a patient suffered from chronic leukorrhea and testicular swelling. He took various drugs, but with little effect. Later, I gave him "Anti-Gonorrhea" to take, and it was like pouring soup on snow, immediately showing miraculous effects. Not only did the testicular swelling subside, but the leukorrhea also stopped immediately. It was completely cured in less than five weeks.</p>
<p>Common Sense About Bone Pain</p>
<h3>Savior for Those Suffering from Bone Pain</h3>
<p>— Physician Yu Bofu</p>
<p>The Great Achievements of "Johnston's Bone Pain Tablets"</p>
<p>Bone pain is a disease that originally had no specific medicine to treat. Especially in this world where things are getting worse and human desires are rampant, this disease is presenting a serious problem. Elderly people who suffer from this disease do so because they have worked too hard in their lives, or they have poor nutrition and do not pay attention to hygiene, causing madness and dampness to invade internally, promoting this disease. However, now we often see a generation of promising young people also complaining about joint pain and numbness in their limbs. What is the reason for this? This is probably because of excessive masturbation or sexual fatigue in their youth, or sexually transmitted diseases, leading to unclean urine and a weakening of the body, losing its resistance. Over time, madness and dampness accumulate internally, and residual toxins attack internally, and this disease can be promoted unintentionally. Suffering from this disease, their pain is no less than being trapped in hell for life.</p>
<p>Dr. Johnston of the United States, in view of this, devoted his life's research and invented "Johnston's Bone Pain Tablets," which is indeed a symptomatic medicine. Whether it is new or old bone pain, it can be cured immediately after taking it, and it will never recur.</p>
<p>Patient Shi Zaichun, 33 years old, indulged in masturbation in his youth and indulged in sexual activity after marriage, seeking pleasure in brothels. As a result, his blood became unclean, and madness and dampness accumulated internally, causing severe bone pain. Every time the seasons changed or he overworked, his limbs and bones would ache. Taking medicine was ineffective, and many doctors were helpless. Later, he purchased and took four bottles of "Johnston's Bone Pain Tablets," and the pain stopped. His whole body felt relaxed, as if a burden had been lifted.</p>

<h3>Our National Football Team: Detailed Account of Two Matches in England. Universal Praise from the Press; Great Surprise Among the British. From Lieshan, Sent from London.</h3>
<p>London Airmail Special</p>
<p>The Chinese football team's participation in the World Games was initially seen as unfortunate, as they were drawn against England in their first match. In international sports competitions, we often encounter strong opponents right away. However, if we don't focus too much on immediate wins and losses, we can understand the significance of this Sino-British football match. This competition has laid the groundwork for the Chinese football team's standing in the international arena. The efforts of the Chinese football team, even though they resulted in a loss, are still our only achievement and gain in these World Games.</p>
<p>Speaking of football, it is the national sport of England. The English football team has always held a leading position internationally. When the news of the match between the Chinese and English teams was announced, the British public felt a sense of novelty. Not only do Chinese people know how to play football, but they have even sent a team to participate in the World Games. Usually, they only use the phrase "Chinese people playing football" as a joke. However, the British newspapers, knowing about our team's performance in Southeast Asia, seemed somewhat concerned, fearing an upset. Some newspapers even suggested that the Chinese team had the potential to "threaten" the "dignity" of the English team. Although our team lost 0-2, the audience and European newspapers unanimously praised our team's skills, with the sentiment "The Chinese team is also a first-class international amateur football team" being heard everywhere. In fact, we were not defeated.</p>
<p>An Introduction by a British Lady</p>
<p>During the Berlin competition, our team's performance was excellent, and our skills were no less than those of the English team. Unfortunately, we lost, which garnered extra sympathy from the audience. Among the audience was a Miss Smith, whose father is the leader of a British amateur football organization, Islington Corinthians. She voluntarily asked her father to arrange matches for our team in London. After several discussions, our team accepted the invitation and decided to play two matches in London against British amateur football teams: the first against the Corinthians team, and the second against the Casuals team, the British Amateur Football Champions.</p>
<p>The Chinese football team arrived in London on August 28th. The person who contributed the most to the reception from the overseas Chinese community was Mr. Zhang Sili, a staff member of the Chinese Association. On the British side, Mr. Smith was particularly enthusiastic. Although the Chinese team members had endured a long journey of four months and played thirty-five matches, with almost half of the team injured, everyone remained spirited and left an excellent impression. In addition to publishing photos of our team members, British newspapers often featured special articles introducing our team's combat capabilities. The "King of Football," Mr. Li Huitang, seemed older than before. After these months of travel, his face showed fatigue. Little Blackie, Chen Zhenhe, lost a lot of weight, probably because he always gives his all in every game. Naturally, this is not surprising, as he suffered from the hardships of travel and the football field. Even Sun Shunjun did not look like a fat person anymore, let alone others. The one in the best spirits was Tan Jiangbai. One look at Tan's physique and you know he should be a football star, but when you talk to him, he is very cultured.</p>
<p>When asked about whether he was used to "European life," Little Blackie said, "I haven't had Chinese food for months and have been eating Western food all day. It's been terrible. I'd rather go back sooner rather than later." Xu Yahui said that he started missing home after two months abroad and wants to return to China as soon as possible. This is almost the motto of the entire team.</p>
<p>One of the team members told the reporter about his views on the Chinese team's skills. He said, "We didn't learn to play football from any teacher. We just watch how others play and steal the good moves." The English Post reported that this team seemed to be stronger than the British team that competed in Berlin.</p>
<p>Before the match, a military band played the national anthems of China and England. Amidst the enthusiastic welcome of 15,000 spectators, the Chinese team took the offensive after the English team kicked off. Our team's skills were high and our teamwork was skillful. We dominated the first half and won a lot of applause. Within five minutes of the start, Feng Jingxiang scored the first goal. Within twenty minutes, Li Huitang received a pass from Chen Zhenhe and, under the watch of the English inner defense, Li still kicked a long shot, and our team scored two goals in a row. Li's kick was clear and beautiful, as if he shot without effort. The applause on the field thundered. A reporter from the British News Summary praised Li's goal as one of the best he had seen in years. The English team counterattacked but was blocked by Huang Jiliang and gained nothing. At thirty minutes, Chen Zhenhe crossed the ball in front of the English goal. The English goalkeeper rushed to save and fell to the ground. The ball was in front of an empty goal, but unfortunately, Feng Jingxiang was one step late and missed a good opportunity. After that, the momentum of the English team suddenly increased, and the Chinese goal was almost completely surrounded. Huang Jiliang was bold, careful, quick, and caught all the high and low balls, leaving the English forwards with no room to develop, until the English midfielder headed in a goal from a corner kick near the end of the first half.</p>
<p>At the start of the second half, the English team relied on its strong physique and seemed to be getting stronger. Our team was already at a disadvantage due to being tired. In addition, players such as Tan Jiang, Huang Jiliang, etc., were injured and barely able to play. In fact, they were not fully recovered, so it was impossible to compare them with professional football teams. I asked him if the team leader gave instructions from the sidelines during the game, and if there was a fixed formation. He said no, we mostly fight on our own and improvise. This may be the reason why the Chinese team failed to make further progress. However, Dr. Rong Qizhao said that after returning to China, he plans to suggest to the Sports Association that they hire an English football coach to come to China. We hope that his plan can be realized soon, and that perhaps in four years, the Chinese football team will have the opportunity to make the Chinese flag fly at the World Games.</p>
<p>The First Day of Competition</p>
<p>Against the Corinthians team, time: August 31st, 6:30 PM, location: Highbury Football Stadium, London. As a result, our team lost 2-3. In the first half, 1-1, our team won. Goal scorers: Li Huitang 1, Feng Jingxiang 1. Our team's formation that day was as follows:</p>
<p>Cai Wenli Huang Jiliang Li Tiansheng</p>
<p>Li Guowei Xu Yahui Liang Rongzhao</p>
<p>Chen Zhenhe Tan Jiangbai Li Huitang Feng Jingxiang Yang Shuiyi</p>
<p>The Han team's formation was as follows:</p>
<p>Ellis Sa Hard Bachel</p>
<p>Teklaf Tanin Dun Eaton</p>
<p>Fenwick Lewis Osborne Sibos Goring</p>
<p>Goal scorers: Tanin Dun 1, Osborne 1, Lewis 1.</p>
<p>This English team is called the Corinthians team, but in reality, it is a collection of elites from various amateur football teams, plus naval and army soldiers. The whole team's spirit was not as good as in the first half. The English team was indeed superior to our team at this point. Fortunately, goalkeeper Huang Jiliang has made amazing progress in recent days, remaining calm and saving several dangerous shots that seemed impossible to save. Once, an English forward dribbled the ball close to the Chinese goal. It seemed that there was little hope, but the goalkeeper Huang had the courage to surprise the opponent, take the opportunity to jump out and fall to the ground, and the ball was forced into a corner kick. Huang Jiliang was the hero of the Chinese team that day. Every time he saved a ball, the audience gave him a burst of warm applause. The British Daily Express said that Huang Jiliang is the star of the Chinese team, and his saves won the hearts of the audience. The News Summary said that the Chinese goalkeeper is a substitute, but his saving skills and agility are no less than the best goalkeepers in the British football team. The Daily Herald said that Huang Jiliang saved so many dangerous balls, and he is still a substitute, so the wonderful skills of the Chinese official goalkeeper can be imagined. Although this is the case, in the twenty minutes before the end of the game, the English forwards successively scored two goals, making the score 3-2. Our team failed. The inside defenders of our team were very good. Cai Wenli and Xu Yahui worked especially hard.</p>
<p>Forward Little Blackie ran fast and did not give way to the British, creating many opportunities to shoot, and was our team's only robot.</p>
<p>After the game, our team members were warmly welcomed by the spectators in the stadium, because they were able to understand the true ability of the Chinese team. When we walked out of the stadium, we still heard the audience greeting the overseas Chinese everywhere: "This was a really good kick!" This is our harvest.</p>
<p>The next day, British newspapers praised our team's performance, with the Daily Mail saying that the names of the Chinese team members are a mystery, but their football playing is not difficult to understand at all. The Daily Express said that the Chinese played a very authentic game of football. The Daily Herald said, "The Chinese team's technique is better than the British team, and their failure is due to bad luck." What more could we ask for? In terms of skills, our team's individual techniques have reached the top level. However, there are also shortcomings: first, the team members are too tired and lack energy. Not only can they not outrun others in the field, but in the last ten or twenty minutes, they can hardly move themselves. The reason for losing the ball lies here, because European football games last for ninety minutes, which is twenty minutes longer than Chinese football games. Secondly, the teamwork is not good enough, and there is no predetermined line of attack. In particular, the communication between the forwards is not smooth, so often after the forward gets the ball, they either pass it to an empty spot, or they have to stand and see where their teammates are, and thus repeatedly lose good shooting opportunities. On the contrary, the English team forwards pass to each other without hesitation as soon as they get the ball, and immediately reach our team's second line of defense. Third, due to physical reasons, their kicking strength is not strong enough, and the forwards' shots are weak. As for tackling the ball, it seems that they are still not as good as the English team. However, the Chinese people are smart and quick-thinking, so many wonderful balls are unexpected by the enemy. This is our team's strength, and it also relies on personal talent, which cannot be learned through hard work.</p>
<p>In addition, there are two other points where the Chinese football team has brought glory to the country. After the Berlin game, the German newspapers praised the elegant behavior of both Chinese and English players during the Sino-British football match, which was in line with the spirit of sportsmen in every way, and was the most ideal match in the World Games, which could be used as a model for everyone. After the London game, the Daily Mail also specifically praised our team for this point: the Chinese team members only kick the ball and do not kick people. This is something we feel we can be very proud of to the world. Another point is that most European newspapers have published the backgrounds of the team members, including doctors, businessmen, officers, policemen, martial artists, students, and all kinds of people in society. This is enough to prove the popularity of football in China. In fact, most of what we hoped for has been achieved. The Chinese football team's trip is only missing a victory in name.</p>
<p>The Second Day of Competition</p>
<p>The opponent was the Casuals team, time: September 1st, 6:00 PM, location: Selhurst Park Football Stadium, London. As a result, our team lost 2-5. First half 1-1. Goal scorers: Li Huitang 1, Sun Jinshun 1.</p>
<p>Our team's formation that day was as follows:</p>
<p>Bao Jiaping</p>
<p>Mai Shaohan Li Tiansheng</p>
<p>Chen Zhenhe Xu Yahui Liang Rongzhao</p>
<p>Ye Beihua Sun Jinshun Li Huitang Feng Jingxiang Cao Guicheng</p>
<p>The English team's formation was as follows:</p>
<p>Hard</p>
<p>Wei Er Satrekla夫</p>
<p>Hochman B乍伊 Tanin Dun</p>
<p>Riley Allen J里 Sebien Goring</p>
<p>English team goal scorers: Goring 2, Riley 1, Allen 1, B乍伊 1.</p>
<p>The English team was based on the amateur champion Casuals team, plus several strong players from other strong teams. Their strength did not seem as strong as the Corinthians team. However, our team had been fighting too many consecutive battles. Although we played with nine official team members, the result of the performance was not as good as the first game. After our team kicked off, the ball was taken away by the English team. The English forwards dribbled the ball to attack, but were blocked by the Chinese inner defense. The Chinese forwards counterattacked again, but it was ineffective. At this time, the ball went back and forth, and although neither side gained anything, the English team seemed to have the upper hand. Bao Jiaping was very busy in front of the goal. Fortunately, he was agile and safe. The left and right wings of the Chinese team made few contributions because they could not outrun the English. Cao Guicheng was old, and every time he got the ball, it was snatched away by the English, which made the Chinese team members in the stands anxious. If they did not achieve success in the first half, there would be even less hope in the second half. In this situation, our team was clearly at a disadvantage. Two minutes before the end of the first half, the English right wing scored a goal first, which made everyone even more worried. However, things in the world are always unexpected. When things are at their worst, they turn for the better. The English team did not get the ball for a minute. After the Chinese forwards got the ball, they crowded in front of the English goal. The English goalkeeper rushed out and knocked the ball away not far. Li Huitang was quick-eyed and rushed forward from the crowd, and by the time the English inner guard realized it, the ball had already rolled into the empty goal. The scoring of this goal was completely unexpected, and everyone could not help but laugh when they saw the ball in the net. The first half ended 1-1, with no winner or loser.</p>
<p>Less than three minutes after the start of the second half, Sun Jinshun got a ball and immediately shot a long shot at the English goal without thinking, and the ball went into the net with a sound, winning a lot of applause. Mr. Li Guowei said in the stands that we now have capital. However, after that, the Chinese team entered a state of depression. Although Bao Jiaping and Xu Yahui tried their best to resist, and Little Blackie showed his ability to run the whole field and fought all the time, it still could not reduce the English team's offensive. Finally, in twenty minutes, the English team scored two more goals one after another, creating a 2-2 situation. At this time, the Chinese team knew that victory was hopeless, and only sought not to lose any more, so they took a defensive position. But everyone felt tired, especially the forwards, who could not attack or defend. At this time, the players' physique was obviously more important than individual skills. If the five forwards of our team this time all had the same physique as Little Blackie, the victory in this game would definitely not have been the English team. In the last five minutes, the English team scored two more goals in a row, and as a result, our team lost 5-2.</p>
<p>The next day, most of the British newspapers reported that our team was too tired, so they failed. The tone was still sympathetic. This was our team's last game in Europe. I hope that everyone will often remember after returning home that what we suffered was only in physical strength, and that we lost the ball in the last five minutes. (London, September 3)</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Cultural Relics Exhibition: Exhibition Period to Open in Hangzhou on October 26; Ningbo, Shaoxing, and Taizhou Collection Branches Send Exhibits</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education has ordered the Zhejiang Cultural Relics Exhibition to be organized by the Provincial Library. Preparations are underway, and collection branches have been set up in Beijing and Shanghai. The news has been published in this newspaper. It is now known that the association was originally scheduled to open on October 10th, but due to the impact of the summer heat on the preparation and collection, it was unable to complete on schedule. In addition, the National Assembly representatives elections held in various provincial regions have further delayed the collection work. Therefore, the Standing Committee members of the association's Design Committee, Wang Tingyang and Yu Yueyuan, sent a public letter to the Provincial Department of Education requesting an extension of the deadline, which has been approved by the department. It has been decided to postpone it to October 26th, and it will still open at the Provincial Library on Hangzhou Daxue Road. Currently, nine administrative supervision districts within Zhejiang Province have established collection branches. Yinxian, Shaoxing, Jiaxing, Taizhou, Yongjia, JiaShan, Yuhang and other places are also following provincial orders to prepare to open local cultural relic exhibitions, some of which have already been held or will be held soon. After the exhibition, they will select and send the exhibits to the province. It is said that Ningbo, Shaoxing, WenZhou, and Jiaxing have collected a lot. The existing local chronicles and enrollment records of Fan's Tianyi Pavilion in Ningbo have also been borrowed with the consent of the Fan family. The Liu family's Jiaye Building in Nanxun has a rich collection of books, among which the manuscripts and rare editions of Zhejiang sages will be sent for collection. The association has contacted various collectors in Hangzhou and is ready. It is expected that the books on display will be very impressive. The association's Executive Committee held its third meeting the day before yesterday (19th), and it is also heard that a Standing Committee meeting of the Design Committee is planned to be held within a week. After the Shanghai Collection Branch was established on the 11th, the Zhejiang Department of Education added Mr. Ye Gongchao as the director of the branch, and Mr. Zhang Shouchong and Qin Runqing as the deputy directors, and designated Ningbo Road Fuyuan Qianzhuang as the venue. It has now started to collect items. Collectors from all walks of life can write to the bank to request the method and registration form for solicitation, and send them to Hangzhou for compilation. The association will be responsible for returning them after the exhibition.</p>

<h3>Provincial and Municipal Schools and Libraries Installed Radio Statistics: A Total of 855 Sets, Jiangsu Province Has the Most</h3>
<p>In order to enable secondary schools and people's education centers in various provinces and cities to universally install radios, so as to enhance the effectiveness of radio broadcasting education, the Ministry of Education promulgated the General Outline of Methods for Installing Radios in Secondary Schools and Public Education Centers Nationwide in June of the 24th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1935]. According to Item 3 of the Outline, secondary schools should complete installation by the end of December of this year, and public education centers should complete installation by the end of June of the 26th year [1937]. The purchase of these wireless radios was entirely arranged by the Ministry with electrical manufacturers, to be paid for on schedule and distributed by the Ministry to the responsible education departments in each province and city for installation in schools and libraries. As for the price of the radios, it was originally supposed to be raised by each province and city, and paid on schedule. However, considering the financial difficulties of schools and libraries in various provinces and cities, the Ministry has carefully considered local conditions and provided appropriate subsidies for the purchase of machines. In the 24th year, the Ministry subsidized the full price for remote provinces, and a half of the price for inland provinces and cities. Subsidies will also be provided in the current year according to local conditions.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Buyers Purchase Yarn for This Month, Revitalizing the Yarn Market; Several Hundred Bales of Yarn Also Stored in Warehouses</h3>
<p>The yarn market is trending upwards. Initially, buyers were purchasing yarn for this month and storing several hundred bales of yarn in warehouses, which made the market increasingly tight. At the same time, the spot yarn sales were brisk, with buyers from Sichuan, the inland, Guangdong, Changsha, and other regions purchasing in succession, further strengthening the upward trend. It eased slightly in the afternoon, but the industry still absorbed the yarns sold for hedging. The last transaction was at 201.7 yuan, which was 4.3 yuan higher than the price of last month.</p>
<p>Yarn for This Month is Even Tighter: At the opening of the bidding yarn market, all months showed a consistent rise, and the market sentiment was even better on the last day of trading for this month's yarn. This was because buyers were purchasing yarn for this month, especially yarn for warehouse storage, as the factories lacked spot goods and the prices were relatively low. As a result, the upward trend became even stronger, and the forward months were also affected. Market prices rose step by step, but Deda, Hengyi, Jinchang, Mingde, Wangtai, Xingxie, and Fukang sold, while Yuda, Tongji, Yiji, Hexing, Senkang, Dianji, and Dachang bought in large quantities. The result of the bidding yarn was that this month rose by 1.9 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day, and the forward months rose by 0.8-0.9 yuan. At the opening in the afternoon, the market situation for this month was slightly flat, as some people sold off their stagnant goods. Although there were buyers, they were still hesitant, and the forward months also fell by 0.3-0.4 yuan. By the close of the market, some people in the industry bought in, and it was heard that spot yarn transactions were still over 3,000 bales, and the price rose again by 0.3-0.4 yuan. As a result, this month fell by 0.7 yuan compared to the closing price in the morning, and the rest fell by 0.2-0.4 yuan.

<h3>Cotton Market Subjected to Pressure After the Rise</h3>
<p>The cotton market is quiet. Because the yarn market is lively, factories have a strong need for raw cotton, and the market prices in various producing areas are firm, and people's hearts are good.

<p>Pure Gold Has Concerns of Falling Back; Specie Buyers Wait and See</p>
<p>Yesterday's gold market saw a decline in buying interest due to a strengthening exchange rate trend and general apprehension about a potential pullback in pure gold prices. As a result, prices retreated by four jiao. Initially, the overseas silver market saw British prices rise and American prices remain stable. There were rumors of "Big Foot" positions selling off after the market closed at listed prices, indicating a weakening market. The forward silver price in Monte Video remained unchanged, with a premium of three and a half li. The exchange rate continued to strengthen, and the price of raw gold in London rose by half a penny. The Central Bank's listed rates were released, showing no change in British and American rates, and the customs gold unit remained unchanged. The listed price for standard gold specie rose to 27.1 yuan. Pre-market trading opened at around 24 yuan, but lacked support due to the rising exchange rate and fears of a decline in raw gold prices. Chun Hui Yong and other firms offered spot sales, opening slightly lower and initially weakening before stabilizing. Major players took advantage of the lower prices to buy, gradually pushing prices back up. However, sellers offered supply at higher prices, and major players also unloaded positions. The HSBC exchange rate listing showed that both British and American rates had fallen back to their previous levels. When the silver equalization tax was announced, it rose by half a fen, leading to a slight increase in trading. However, due to a large number of players taking advantage of the higher prices, there was continued selling pressure, making it difficult for prices to rise further. As a result, the trend at midday was peaceful, but with much struggle. Yesterday, the swap rate was quoted by the long side at 2.8 yuan. The following is a record of the market situation for the first half of the day:</p>
<p>The market opened this morning at 1123.6 yuan, four jiao lower than the previous closing price. Chun Yuan Yong sold off, falling 3.4 yuan. Heng Yu, Sheng Yuan Yong, Da De Cheng and others bought heavily, rising to 4 yuan. Yuan Heng, Qia Feng Yong, and others sold off, retreating to 3.6 yuan. The HSBC exchange rate listing showed no change in British and American rates, and the silver equalization tax rose by half a fen. There was some struggle in the middle of the day. Fu Xing Yong, Jin Feng Yong, Qing Fa Yong, and others took advantage of the lower prices to buy heavily, rising to 3.9 yuan. Yuan Mao Yong continued to sell, and retreated again to 3.6 yuan. Finally, although Qing Fa Yong and others advanced, Tong Tai Chang and others supplied, leading to a struggle. At noon, the market closed at 1123.6 yuan.</p>
<p>The closing price, based on the Central Bank's listed price for standard gold, rose to 1117.1 yuan. According to the closing price, it rose by about 6 yuan. The ledger prices for this month are 1118 yuan, October 1121 yuan, and November 1124 yuan. The spot market was stable, with Tianjin goods quoted at 9.75 yuan. Cooked red gold was selling at 11.5 yuan and buying at 7.5 yuan, with few counterparts. The ten-eleven month spread was quoted by Da Feng Heng to Chun Yuan Yong at 210 lots, Yi Yu at 14 lots, at 2.8 yuan.</p>
<p>Trading within the market was relatively peaceful. In summary, Jin Feng Yong, Heng Yu, Qing Fa Yong, Da De Cheng, Sheng Yuan Yong and others were on the buying side, while Tong Tai Chang, Shen Da Yong, Chun Yuan Yong, Xiang Feng, Qia Feng Yong, Fu Xing Yong, Yuan Heng and others were on the selling side.</p>
<p>The market situation for the first half of the day was peaceful, with the opening and closing prices both at 1123.6 yuan. The highest price was 1124 yuan, and the lowest price was 1123.4 yuan, with a range of six jiao. As a result, the market retreated four jiao compared to the previous closing price. There are still 595 gold bars remaining for this month, with a total of eight long positions and five short positions. The total number of transactions for the first half of the day was 1316 gold bars.</p>
<p>There are still 994 gold bars remaining from the October period that have not been swapped, with eleven long positions and eleven short positions.</p>
<p>The positions for the November period are as follows: Long positions include Fu Xing Yong with over 1000 lots, Heng Chang Yong with over 800, Wan Xing with over 700, Da Chang Xiang and Yuan Mao Yong with over 600 each, Wu Chang Xiang with over 400, Shen Kang with over 300, and Shun Li, Jin Feng Yong, and Qing Fa Yong with over 100 each.

The total number of lots is 7308, with a total of 30 long positions and 39 short positions.</p>
<h3>Currency Exchange: Although the US Dollar is Loose, It Can Still Be Maintained</h3>
<p>Yesterday's currency market saw a rise in exchange rates, with British currency tight and the US dollar loose, leading to a significant number of settlements. Early in the morning, overseas telegrams reported that London "big foot" positions, both near and far, rose by 0.0625. It was said that after the market closed, there were sellers offering at the listed price, indicating a weakening market. The New York silver market remained unchanged, and the Monte Video forward silver price remained unchanged, with a premium of three and a half li.

The Central Bank's listed rates were released, showing no change in British and American rates, and the customs gold unit remained unchanged. The opening selling prices for the near-term market were 1 shilling, 2 pence, 0.25 and 0.3125 for British currency, and 30.1875 yuan for US currency. Compared to the previous close, the British rate was slightly tighter, while the US dollar was looser by 0.03125. After the opening, bank spreads varied, with occasional swaps. The HSBC exchange rate listing showed that both British and American rates remained unchanged and fluctuated. After the silver equalization tax was announced, it rose by half a fen. Foreign firms and Mobil were buying US dollars, and banks were happy to trade against them. The process was still struggling. Until noon, the selling prices for the near-term market were 1 shilling, 2 pence, 0.25 and 0.3125 for British currency, and 30.1875 yuan for US currency. Compared to the previous close, the British rate was slightly softer, while the US dollar was harder by 0.03125. The forward market was the same. Chinese merchants were watching from the sidelines, and banks were trading against each other. Foreign firms had a relatively large number of settlements. The following is a record of the transactions for the first half of the day:</p>

<h3>Securities: Public Bond Trading Mostly Swaps</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, with only two days left until the settlement date, swap trading in the market was extremely active. Although the atmosphere was lively, the market price was not greatly affected. Due to different choices, the rise and fall were quite uneven. The sale of Class B bonds for this month on the 11th caused a unique small fluctuation. Although the environmental changes are still constantly evolving, the market price, due to the relationship between chips, should not have any major changes. Today is the last day for September futures. Although there may be squeezing, it should be limited. Looking back on yesterday, the market opened up about 1.2 jiao in the morning. Although the secondary market was slightly uncertain, there were still more gains than losses. In the afternoon, the atmosphere for the 10th and 54th bonds suddenly became strong, and they unanimously retreated about 0.8 jiao. At the close, Class A bonds tended to be firm, while Class B bonds were pressured too heavily by the 55th bond, falling another 0.2 jiao. The rest were also weak and sluggish. The trend is unlikely to have major changes in the short term. Yesterday's market price resulted in a high and mutual change. Class Ding and Jia bonds rose by 0.3 jiao, while the rest unanimously continued to fall by 0.5 fen to 2.5 jiao. The total number of transactions was 8.18 million yuan. The following is a comparative table of the results of the rise and fall (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>
<h3>Food: Spot Sales Are Brisk, Flour Prices Are Booming</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw a sudden boom due to brisk spot sales. When the market opened in the morning, although Liverpool's report on foreign wheat was down by half a penny, Chicago and Canada both rose by 5-6 jiao. Near and far positions were heavily hedged. The initial situation showed a tight upward trend. Subsequently, the Tianjin gang opened a whole batch of spot flour to the Fu Fu factories, totaling 160-170,000 bags, priced at 3.13 yuan. The market's morale became more excited. Although there was a lot of profit-taking in the current month, since the factories had opened up spot flour, they would take back the chips for this month. The long positions of non-industry players were more focused on the forward market, so the buying sentiment was particularly strong in the afternoon, and the market gradually strengthened. If flour sales continue in the future, and the factory's inventory loosens, there may be a stable atmosphere for the time being. Compared to the previous day's closing price, this month rose by 3.5 fen, October rose by 1.75 li, November rose by 2 fen, December rose by 2.5 fen, January rose by 3.75 fen, and February rose by 3 fen.</p>
<p>Highest Lowest Closing Comparison</p>
<p>September 3.2000 3.1550 3.1850 Up 0.0350</p>
<p>October 3.1300 3.2925 3.2150 Also 0.0575</p>
<p>November 3.2625 3.2375 3.2575 Also 0.0200</p>
<p>December 3.2050 3.2800 3.3050 Also 0.0250</p>
<p>January 3.3625 3.3225 3.3600 Also 0.0375</p>
<p>February 3.3800 3.3150 3.3775 Also 0.0300</p>
<h3>There is No Shortage of Selling at High Prices; Wheat Prices Increase, But Near Months are Slightly Weaker</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market initially saw foreign telegrams from Chicago and Canada reporting increases of 5-6 jiao, although Liverpool fell by half a penny. However, because the previous day's gains were too great, it was not worth paying attention to. Moreover, spot wheat sales are still active. The opening atmosphere was prosperous. Subsequently, flour sales were smooth, and people's morale became more prosperous. Therefore, both the front and rear markets rose in unison. Although new goods have arrived, they have not yet reached the point of decline. As the market rose, there were many sellers selling short, so this month's gains were slightly lagging behind. The result for the whole day was that this month rose by 3 fen, November rose by 7 fen, December rose by 4 fen, and October, January, and February each rose by 5 fen. The spot wheat market also saw an increase. Shandong high wheat has opened to 5.15 yuan, and Yingzhou wheat has opened to 5.1 yuan. The remaining high-quality wheat from Gaoyou, Daqiao, Hankou, etc., ranged from 4.95 yuan to 4.78 yuan. The total number of transactions for the day was 4,000 bags, with Fu Xin importing 3,000 bags and Shen Da importing 1,000 bags.</p>
<p>Highest Lowest Closing Comparison</p>
<p>September 4.96 4.93 4.96 Up 0.03</p>
<p>October 5.18 5.14 5.17 Up 0.05</p>

<h3>High and Secondary Quality Ke Xian Rice Selling Prices Fall Daily</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Ke Xian rice continued to arrive, with whole batches arriving from the Yangtze River area, resulting in abundant reserves and a continuous supply. The market continued to appear lifeless. Although the disposal of Japanese Ke rice was active yesterday, it ultimately fell due to too much supply. Both the merchants and the Ke gang took the initiative to devalue prices and sell off quickly. Therefore, high and secondary grades all decreased by 3-5 fen to 8-9 fen. If there is no smooth handling by the Cantonese gang, the downward trend will still be strong. Yesterday, the Cantonese gang disposed of 5,000 bags of rough rice, and Ningbo and this street also inquired. The total output for the day was 2,730 bags of Jiangxi rice, 3,820 bags of Hunan rice, and 2,200 bags of Sand Beach rough rice. There were no imports or exports of other types of rice.</p>
<h3>New Rice Floods In, Market Steps Down</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of goods from each gang was stronger than before, with a total arrival of 32-33 ships, carrying more than 6,000 shi. Among them, most were new goods. Therefore, if new japonica rice's local sales continue to be sluggish, the market color will be unbearably tired and the market will fall another 2 jiao. The new Baige bags were used to eat 70 bags, and because the fresh goods in the previous market were blasted too high, there was a sharp drop of more than three chi. As for the broken goods, the source is gradually scarce, slightly depreciating by a few fen. Although there are Qingdao gangs handling 5-600 bags of thin broken bag goods, the retail sales are poor, so those who can have bagzi procurement should be able to stabilize, and the rest are cut by 1-2 jiao. After the continuous sharp drop in Xin Lujian, the activities of urban and rural stores have gradually seen activity, so even though there is a lot of arrival, the downward trend has been able to be controlled, slightly repairing a jiao. The new Yangjian is the opposite, with a short reduction of half a jiao to a jiao. Chen Xinbian Yuanda has no market to arrive.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 31-32 ships came from the wharves along the river. The sales of each type of goods in the market moved slightly. The market form broken japonica high-quality goods is tight, and the middle and secondary grades have no major honor or disgrace. The West Xin Geng high-quality goods are flat, and the middle and secondary grades are repaired by nearly a jiao. The New Yangdujian continued to be tired by nearly a jiao. The change of yuan is flat, Xinbujian is tightly tied by several points, thin rice, Lingbaijian price is outside a small jiao, Chen Meijian is firm, Dongxin Geng price is down a small jiao, and Xin Ke Baibai is rotten.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Market Situation Firm and Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Yokohama was closed due to a holiday, and the New York silk market rose slightly. People's morale is still looking good. The local white factory silk market felt particularly clear and firm. Both user foreign firms have temporarily stopped purchasing, and the silk prices of sellers remain firm and persistent, so there is not much silk transaction, and the market situation is controlled. The sales of Jili silk and Chuanlu silk were also only sporadic, and the price also rose with the rise. Yesterday, foreign estates transacted 877 packages, and users jointly purchased 20 packages. Among them, the sale of White Factory Yuanyuan 16/18 at a price of 675 yuan was particularly strong.</p>
<h3>Black Tea Whole Sales Plan Progresses Smoothly</h3>
<p>The Anhui-Jiangxi Black Tea General Sales Office previously formulated a whole sales plan for the more than 7,000 boxes remaining in the market, and has repeatedly negotiated with Wang Yutai Tea Shop, and there are already signs. However, in order to take into account the interests of tea merchants, under the principle of not violating the whole sales principle, it is stipulated that yesterday and today are the deadline. All merchants with available funds can submit them and sell them to foreign firms separately. Therefore, yesterday, Xiehe Jinlong and other firms absorbed a large amount, and have already issued 2-3,000 boxes. The rest will be fully sold by Wang Yutai.</p>
<p>According to the report of the Tea Warehouse Industry Association, the green tea market in recent days has been trading with foreign buyers by telegram. If the reply price matches the market price, the transaction is completed at any time. Yesterday, buyers continued to have a small number of telegram transactions. A few scattered Xiehe Baolong and Tianxiang each entered dozens of boxes of premium Zhen, and the selling price was stable. Huacha entered more than one hundred boxes of Wuzhen at a price of about 60 yuan, and Baitouhang continued to have Gongxi transactions. After Jinlong dismantled five or six gangs of Dabu Pingshui tea, Sanyang also sold one gang one after another.</p>
<h3>Seafood: New Scallops are Short in Harvest and Expensive - Leafy Vegetables are Out of Season and Sales are Dull -</h3>
<p>Scallops The new goods are short in harvest, and the source is extremely small. Therefore, the market price in this city has become tighter day by day. The previous batch totaled twelve boxes, and the market price opened up to 205 yuan. Moreover, the firms are deeply interested in importing goods, and do not retreat due to the high price. If the goods are still scarce in the future, the market is likely to continue to rise.</p>
<p>Leafy Vegetables As the weather steps into the cold season, passenger sales have turned lax, and the inventories of the dealers are rarely visited. Moreover, each stall has a considerable amount of inventory, resulting in oversupply. Therefore, the market has gradually loosened. The current sale of large, square, glass, high-quality goods for box restaurants is priced at 145 yuan, and yellow secondary goods are only sold at 70 yuan. Ningbo goods are 80 yuan for the upper stall, 60 yuan for the middle stall, and 40-50 yuan for the lower stall.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Dutch Red Sugar is Short, Adding 3 Jiao - Futures Traded 200 Tons...Hainan Red Rose 2 Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market morning trend was stable, the association divided the market, the price of No. 24 coarse sand white spot and re-export goods did not move, Dutch red was short of spot and shouted 16.4 yuan, Dongbai and this factory white were called the original price, the foreign firm side, Da Chang opened 200 tons of Dutch red loaded in November, the price was 2.5 yuan and a half (Dutch currency), Hainan red continued to open more than 200 bags, 14.2 yuan, the joint venture company yesterday for the second time this week to bid for the futures of Wuyang coarse white, the total quota was 8,616 bags, the bid price was the same as before, when the Shunde factory Wuyang white 1,118 bags, Quxi factory again 120 bags, 20.7 yuan, the city new factory again 220 bags, 21.2 yuan, and Zhongsha white 150 bags, 19.3 yuan, a total of 1,608 bags were transacted.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Haikou Branch Opened 1,700 Boxes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Haikou Shuidong lychee dry fruit, a total of more than 1,700 boxes were opened. There were slight differences in the goods compared with the previous ones, with a rise and fall of more than one yuan, and no change in the lower grades. The market trend was flat.</p>
<h3>Zhou Yuji and His Wife</h3>
<p>— Zheng Kanzi</p>
<p>—The Ming Dynasty was overthrown by valiant generals and their wives, like Zhou Yuji and his wife—</p>
<p>Over three hundred years ago, during the waning years of the Ming Dynasty, a retired seventy-year-old Vice Commander of the Embroidered Uniform Guard in Jinzhou Garrison was bedridden. He had been paralyzed on one side for three years. His situation was dire. His position was hereditary; he inherited it at the age of seven when his father died, becoming a Vice Commander of the Embroidered Uniform Guard. In his prime, he followed Yang Hao in managing affairs in Korea (in 1597, the 25th year of the reign of Emperor Wanli of the Ming Dynasty), and was promoted to Commander of the Embroidered Uniform Guard for his military merits. In his later years, he offended the eunuch Wei Zhongxian and was demoted to his original position. After retirement, his son, Yuji, should have inherited the position, but he only had this one son and no other relatives. Yuji was unwilling to leave home, preferring to give up the position to stay and care for his elderly father. However, this old Mr. Zhou had always been generous in helping others and had not saved any money for his retirement. Now, they relied entirely on Yuji's hunting for a living. Going into the mountains to hunt required at least a day and a half. The patient was bedridden, needing tea and water and constant attention. Therefore, Yuji would not go hunting unless the rice and firewood were completely exhausted and he had no other choice. Sometimes, he would be fully armed, going to the back of the house to lead his horse, but peering through a hole in the wall, he would see his father's unwell expression. Unable to leave, he would rather endure hunger. Other times, he would be halfway there, hearing his father's moans from afar (obviously a psychological effect), feeling deeply distressed and immediately reining in his horse and galloping back. As for his father, he was also unusually concerned about his son. Yuji's face was naturally round, but old Mr. Zhou always felt that his son was getting thinner by the day. Everyone who knew Yuji respected him, but old Mr. Zhou always worried that his son would be bullied. As soon as Yuji excused himself to go out, the moment the door moved, he would think his son had returned. When Yuji went hunting, if the weather showed any sign of change, he would pray with tears in his eyes, waiting until his son returned before stopping.</p>
<p>One day, Yuji went out hunting, and before long, the sky suddenly turned completely yellow. Old Mr. Zhou guessed that a strong wind was coming, or it would rain, and he was both afraid and worried, constantly muttering to himself, "Son, there will be a big wind and rain soon, come back!" After waiting for a while without seeing his son return, he changed his words and said, "Heavenly Lord, let the wind and rain come another day; for the sake of the people, don't let my son suffer."</p>
<p>In fact, old Mr. Zhou was overthinking everything. Yuji had undergone rigorous training since childhood and was now very strong and robust, able to draw a bow with hundreds of pounds of force as easily as if it were nothing. He had high ambitions and was very capable of enduring hardship; he would not consider wading through fire and water to be anything, let alone a little wind and rain. He remembered that four years ago, Yuji was a guerrilla officer in the capital garrison. At that time, most of the officers in the capital garrison were descendants of meritorious officials and eunuchs, accustomed to extravagance and licentiousness. Seeing Yuji's diligence, frugality, and kindness, they looked down on him. Yuji not only did not mind but instead advised them, "You are all pampered youths, how can you withstand a great enemy? Why not practice martial arts when there is nothing to do, for future use, so as not to waste the country's salary." Hearing Yuji's words, they laughed at him for being pedantic. Yuji ignored them and diligently practiced martial arts, so everyone else fell into depravity, while he became physically strong and vigorous. This time, Yuji decided to prepare provisions for his father for one or two months. Fearing that he would ruin his plan, he dared not think about the current difficulty of separation, only thinking that for one or two months, father and son could stay together, never leaving each other's side. Just as Yuji was chasing rabbits and deer in the mountains, a distinguished guest suddenly arrived at his home. This guest, surnamed Liu, was a current General. When he was still unsuccessful, he often stayed at the Zhou family and received many kindnesses from old Mr. Zhou. To repay his gratitude, he had promised his beloved daughter, Bingniang, to Yuji in marriage. Later, he became successful while the Zhou family declined, and he intended to break off the engagement. Old Mr. Zhou also felt that "marriage should be between equals," and never mentioned the marriage, planning to agree as soon as General Liu opened his mouth to cancel the engagement. Unexpectedly, General Liu looked down on this prospective in-law and even wanted to directly marry Bingniang to someone else, without going through the formalities of canceling the engagement with the Zhou family. Fortunately, Bingniang's heart was set on Yuji and she refused to break the engagement, arguing forcefully with her father. Originally, Bingniang had lived with Yuji since childhood, and Yuji taught her all the martial arts he learned from his instructors. They had made vows of eternal love, saying that in the future they would become husband and wife and sacrifice themselves together to serve the country. General Liu could not bear his daughter's righteous rebuke, and also because his daughter was too capable to control, he had to agree to recruit Yuji to join the General's mansion. He was now personally visiting for this matter. Old Mr. Zhou felt that Yuji would eventually marry a wife, and since General Liu was unwilling to break off the engagement, he had no choice but to let Yuji join the family. Before the matter was settled, the wind suddenly began to blow strongly, and old Mr. Zhou was worried about Yuji, unable to talk vigorously. General Liu thought that his prospective in-law was intentionally treating him coldly and was about to leave, using the excuse of coaxing Bingniang. Just as he was about to bid farewell, Yuji returned. That day, he had only caught half a hunt, because he saw the sky becoming increasingly terrible in the mountains, remembered that the windows at home were not closed properly, and feared that his father would suffer, so he had to come back early.</p>
<p>General Liu had left the Zhou family when Yuji was seventeen years old, and it had been eight years since then. Seeing that Yuji had grown even more handsome and heroic, he could not help but respect and love him. So he sat down again and explained his intentions to Yuji. Yuji stood in front of General Liu, cupping his hands and listening respectfully. After listening, he looked at his father without saying a word. Old Mr. Zhou understood that his son meant to let him decide. He felt that for Yuji's future, he had to agree, so he said to General Liu, "Brother, is there anything else you haven't considered for Yuji? I believe in you, I agree with you, you choose a good day and take Yuji to join your family."</p>
<p>Yuji originally observed propriety and did not express his opinion. He did not expect his father to not immediately agree to General Liu's request. At this point, he could not help but speak. He turned to his father and said, "Father, Uncle Liu knows that you are old and sick and that I alone cannot take care of you properly, so he is sending his beloved daughter to help me. I am extremely grateful for this. As for asking me to leave you to become his son-in-law, I would rather die than obey. Uncle Liu is a reasonable person, and I don't think he would do such a thing." His voice was very loud, and every word was clear to General Liu. General Liu dared not mention anything else, only saying that he would go home to discuss it further before making a decision.</p>
<p>A few days after General Liu returned, he sent someone to bring Bingniang over. From then on, the Zhou and Liu families rarely interacted. It is said that when General Liu returned home, he wanted to break off the engagement again. Bingniang argued with him for several days. He became angry and sent Bingniang to the Zhou family, declaring that he would no longer care about her.</p>
<p>After Bingniang arrived at the Zhou family, the Zhou family immediately prospered. Hunting outside and caring for her father-in-law at home, the couple took turns. In addition to hunting, they also engaged in animal husbandry. In less than two years, they had a thousand sheep. Unfortunately, old Mr. Zhou contracted this symptom and could not enjoy it for long. In the third year after his daughter-in-law entered the door, all his functions ceased to work, and he died peacefully in his son's arms.</p>
<p>After old Mr. Zhou died, the Manchus often invaded, becoming increasingly severe, and Jinzhou could no longer be a peaceful place to live. One day, Bingniang said to Yuji, "The country is being invaded by foreigners, now is the time for heroes to die on the battlefield. Why don't you join the army immediately? I think my father definitely needs people there. Go ahead! Don't worry about me being here alone. I can go back to my parents' home. Love for one's flesh and blood is innate, my father won't refuse to take me in. If you don't want to break up our family, I am willing to stay here. I often go hunting in the mountains and have met twenty Mongol women. They are all skilled in riding and archery, and extremely brave. I have become friends with them for life and death. I plan to bring them over to live with me as soon as you leave, and practice martial arts with them every day. When you are in a position to be independent and have the authority to recruit us, we will definitely come and join your command to serve the country. Who says women can't save the country? Who says women can't charge into battle? We want to break historical records and set a good example for future generations." Bingniang spoke with great decisiveness and force, her eyebrows showing an inviolable aura.</p>
<p>Yuji was very moved by Bingniang's words. Just then, a maid brought tea in. Yuji took the teacup, without thinking, smashed it on the ground with a bang, splashing碎磁黃水 everywhere. The maid was startled, and Bingniang quickly waved her hand to tell her to leave. Yuji turned around and knelt in front of Bingniang, pointing to the ground and saying to her, "How about I swear with you to shatter my body and spill my brains on the ground to repay the country?" Bingniang quickly returned the bow and said, "This is exactly my wish."</p>
<p>Yuji slowly helped Bingniang up and sighed to her, "Ah! You are brave, you are chivalrous, you are filial, you are loyal——" Suddenly, he changed his tone and said, "Sister, I believe you understand me. The reason I have accumulated wealth in recent years is not to 'ask for houses and seek fields,' but half to entertain my father in his old age and half to donate money to help the border. Now, unfortunately, my father is dead." He could not help but shed tears, "What is the use of keeping the property? Let's take it all and distribute it to supplement the military expenses! I used to hold a position in the capital garrison, so there is no need to go to my father-in-law's place. As for you, it's better to wait for me at home, so that you can often visit my father's grave when you have time. When I need your help, I will come in person or send someone to pick you up. Bring those twenty Mongol women to live with you, now is the time when the country needs talent, no one is useless. But you must remember, never neglect your archery skills. If you don't practice in peacetime, where will you have the skills to use in times of emergency?"</p>
<p>Bingniang agreed to everything. After a few days, after everything was arranged, Yuji went to the tomb to bid farewell to his father, left Jinzhou, and joined the army in the Pass. By the seventeenth year of Chongzhen, Yuji had been promoted several times for his accumulated military merits, already serving as the General guarding Shanxi and the three passes of Daizhou, and was awarded the title of Commander of the Central Military Governor's Office of the Crown Prince, naturally Bingniang and the Mongol women had come to serve in the army.</p>
<p>At that time, not only were the border guards in emergency, but also the rebel bandits in the Central Plains were rampant beyond description. Shaanxi and Shanxi had already fallen, and the capital region was collapsing. Only the Ningwu Pass, guarded by Yuji and his wife, stood firm like a pillar in the middle of the stream. Seeing that the news was too urgent, Yuji immediately increased the number of locked soldiers by two thousand, under the command of Xiong Tong. When the troops arrived at the riverbank, the rebellious general Chen Shangzhi welcomed the bandits and forced Xiong Tong to return to the town and say that Yuji had surrendered. Yuji angrily scolded, "I have received great kindness from the country, how can I follow you rebels? You lead two thousand soldiers, unable to stop the bandits, and instead come here as a spokesman for the bandits?" Then he ordered, "Execute Xiong Tong immediately." After Xiong Tong was executed, Yuji sent the chief of the sentinel office, Yang Zhirong, to take the head to the capital and request reinforcements.</p>
<p>On the fifteenth day of the second month, the rebel bandit Li Zicheng led hundreds of thousands of troops directly to Ningwu Pass. Zicheng, since breaking through Taiyuan, had come sweeping through victoriously, full of pride. He said to his subordinates nonchalantly, "Ningwu Pass is neither strong nor dangerous, and its military strength is weak. To break through it is simply like crushing dry weeds. You pass on my decree, saying, 'If Ningwu Pass is not taken in five days, a great massacre will be carried out.'"</p>
<p>Yuji had just taken over guarding Ningwu Pass, and everything had to be rearranged, which was time-consuming and laborious. Moreover, this pass had always lacked military preparation. Yuji trained his troops day and night, selecting only a few thousand brave men from the city. Compared with the bandit army, we were few and they were many, truly a case of a mantis trying to stop a chariot. Yuji knew that the capital would definitely not send reinforcements, and even if they did, they would not be able to arrive in time. He was very anxious and could not help but show his worry on his face. Seeing this, Bingniang was afraid that it would delay the military plan, and secretly comforted Yuji, "In times of danger, composure is essential for success. Have plans for victory and plans for defeat, do your best and leave the rest to fate. There is nothing for us to worry about."</p>
<p>"Then what are you planning?" Yuji asked, still with a worried look.</p>
<p>"Planning to be a general who dies fighting to the end. Your oath to 'shatter your body and spill your brains on the ground' can truly be put into practice today." She spoke with great strength and composure, which truly gave Yuji a lot of encouragement and comfort. Yuji happily said, "Just like you said, I have also made up my mind."</p>
<p>Yuji then summoned his troops, inspiring them with loyalty and righteousness. The couple led the soldiers themselves, and before the bandits had settled their camps, they charged out, directly attacking the core of the bandits, killing many of the bandit army's elite. But because the bandits were many, their momentum was only blunted but not broken. After more than a dozen battles, the bandits had already approached the city. Yuji and his wife tried their best to defend, firing cannons and killing more than ten thousand bandits. Yuji's battle plan was to deploy troops outside the city during the day, using battle as defense; at night, he withdrew the troops into the city, climbing the walls to attack. By the third day, the gunpowder was exhausted. An officer said to Yuji, "The bandits' power is too great, why not negotiate a truce with them?" Yuji replied, "We have only fought for three days and have already killed more than ten thousand bandits, what are you still afraid of? If we are lucky enough to win, none of the army will lose their righteousness; if we are unfortunate enough to lose, you can hand me over to the bandits and everything will be fine." After Yuji finished speaking, he opened the door and fought bravely, killing several thousand bandits.</p>
<p>At night, the bandits thought that both sides were exhausted from fighting and everyone needed to rest, so nothing would happen, and they were not prepared at all. Unexpectedly, in the middle of the night, Yuji and his wife led hundreds of brave men, climbing down the city walls and directly breaking into the bandit camp to kill bandits. The bandits were startled, and one of the bandits, who did not have time to put on armor or saddle his horse, was already separated from his head and body. At that time, the ones who killed the most bandits were the twenty Mongol women, a fresh force. The bandit soldiers, in the firelight, saw the women wearing silver armor, holding bright long knives, running quickly and silently, and were shocked by their power. Before they could guard against it, a cold light flashed, and they suddenly felt a sharp pain, not realizing that their head blood had already been splattered on their bodies. Originally, the Mongol women in Yuji's command were paid like assistant generals. Yuji selected twenty strong men with outstanding martial arts skills and had each of them marry a Mongol woman. They were not used in battle unless it was absolutely necessary. They received full training and rest, so they were able to kill countless enemies.</p>
<p>This raid on the camp defeated the bandit army, and they were afraid and retreated twenty miles at night. At this time, the city had already run out of arrows and food, barely managing to hold out for another half a month, and reinforcements still did not arrive. Yuji had no choice but to decide to fight to the death. So he first ambushed brave soldiers everywhere and opened the door to pretend to surrender. Zicheng knew that the defending soldiers had no way out but to surrender, so he believed it and sent more than ten thousand bandit soldiers into the city. As soon as the bandit soldiers entered the city, Yuji immediately lowered the city gate, and with the sound of a signal cannon, the ambushed soldiers rose up and killed the bandit soldiers, leaving not a single piece of armor. Four brave generals of the bandit army were also seriously injured.</p>
<p>Zicheng, having suffered repeated defeats, was extremely frustrated. He believed that Ningwu Pass could not be broken and feared that if they continued to hold out, the entire army would be wiped out, and he intended to flee back to his old nest. Someone in the bandit army came up with a plan for Zicheng, "Your Majesty has hundreds of thousands of troops and cannot defeat a few thousand people, how can you command the world? Now the elite of the city have been exhausted, and there are not many old and weak left. Why not take the city at this time? We are many and they are few, and if we can distinguish between the main and guest armies during battle, attacking one with ten, there is no reason not to win. Your Majesty can use a surprise victory, and order the soldiers to take off their hats as a mark, and kill those who are wearing hats." Zicheng listened to his words and attacked with all his troops. Yuji's soldiers, some of whom could fight ten people alone, some of whom could fight hundreds of people alone, were so disparate in strength that they were still able to hold out for four days and nights. When the city was breached, the residents, grateful for the loyalty and righteousness of Yuji and his wife, risked their lives to cooperate with the remaining soldiers, engaging the bandits in close combat, street battles, and resistance. Therefore, the entire city's people died heroically together, and not a single child or woman was willing to surrender. Yuji led the citizens in street battles, jumping and fighting on foot. When his spear broke and his sword broke, he could still kill dozens of people with his hands. Yuji was eventually seriously injured and captured alive by the bandits. Yuji cursed the bandits incessantly. The bandits tied him to a high pole and shot him to death with random arrows, his entire body covered with arrows like a hedgehog. Afterward, the bandit soldiers were moved by Yuji's loyalty and bravery, and many people shed tears for him.</p>
<p>While the street battles were raging, Bingniang led the women to climb onto the roofs, resisting to the death. Each of their arrows could kill a person, never missing. The bandit soldiers dared not approach and set fire to the houses, but they did not come down, standing and letting the fire burn them to death. At the same time, the twenty Mongol women, on the other hand, launched a surprise attack. They hid in the house, opening all the inner and outer doors, and tying Yuji's steed to the front door. The bandit soldiers were very afraid of Yuji and originally dared not enter, but wanting to risk getting this steed, everyone rushed to pull it. The women inside fired crossbows in succession, shooting to death several hundred people. When the arrows were all shot, they jumped into the fire one by one.</p>
<p>Zicheng's attack on Ningwu Pass was a victory on the surface, but in reality, the losses were truly great. He inspected the troops and found that the generals and soldiers killed before and after numbered nearly one hundred thousand, and most of the remaining ones were disabled and weak. He wanted to raise and replenish his troops here, but looking at the city he had obtained, not a single person remained, not a single斗 of grain was stored, not a single usable weapon, not a single piece of cloth that could be clothed, the houses were either completely destroyed or half-collapsed, and the four walls were一片瓦礫, simply like a ruins. Seeing this situation, Zicheng constantly shook his head and sighed, "Such a victory is no better than defeat. If I had known this, I would not have come to attack Ningwu Pass. This Yuji is truly formidable! Alas! It is also destined that we are unlucky, why didn't we use a counter-espionage scheme first, and only attack after we had lured the tiger away from the mountain?" He swallowed a mouthful of saliva in regret and said, "We originally planned to go straight to the imperial capital, but who dares to think so now? There are one hundred thousand soldiers in Datong, one hundred thousand soldiers in Xuanfu, one hundred thousand soldiers in Juyong, and a total of two hundred thousand soldiers in Yanghe and other towns. If they are all like Ningwu Pass, would there be anyone left of us? It is better to return to Shaanxi, and wait for the troops to rest and expand before finding another auspicious road." The bandit generals all nodded in agreement and decided to return to Shaanxi tomorrow. So the bandit generals gathered around to discuss how to make the wounded and sick soldiers retreat slowly. They talked late into the night, when suddenly it was reported that Jiang Huai, the General of Datong, had sent someone to submit a letter of surrender. The bandits were very surprised and happy, and hurriedly set up a banquet to treat him with great care. Just as they were seated, it was reported that Wang Chengyun, the General of Yifu, had also sent a letter of surrender, and had sent one hundred riders to welcome them. Zicheng was overjoyed beyond expectation and immediately changed from retreating to advancing, using the various rebel generals as the vanguard, and advanced straight to the capital, forcing Emperor Sizong of the Great Ming to his death.</p>
<p>The bandit soldiers who arrived at the capital, some with half faces and some with broken hands and feet, were all wounded during the battle at Ningwu Pass. They told people, biting their fingers, "General Zhou is truly a hero, if there were another town like Ningwu, how could we have come here? It is rare that his wife is also as virtuous and loyal as he is." The prestige of Yuji and his wife quickly spread throughout the capital, and no one who talked about them was not amazed and awed, calling them大人 and 夫人.</p>

<h3>From "The Analects" to "Lost Classics"</h3>
<p>— Yi Fu</p>
<p>—The Gradual Decline of Humorous Essays—</p>
<p>Since Mr. Lin Yutang advocated humorous essays and published the semi-monthly journal "The Analects," in recent years, a humorous atmosphere has permeated the surroundings, as if enveloping the entire China in the atmosphere of humor and late Ming essays.</p>
<p>"The Analects" started by promoting humor and advocating the late Ming essays. Consequently, this humor, that humor, humorous writing, humorous conversations, even advertisements in movie theaters and various stores, all regarded humor as orthodox and labeled it as modern. Humor's popularity truly reached its peak.</p>
<p>At that time, bookstore publishers also leaned towards this path. As a result, Yuan Zhonglang suddenly rose to prominence again. You punctuate, I proofread, and some even achieved fame because of this.</p>
<p>Lin Yutang's advocacy of humor led to the popularity of late Ming essays, and even led to the surge of heavily discounted books. Many bookstore owners and Hai Pai (Shanghai School) literati who set up stalls relied on this for a living. This is probably something that Mr. Lin Yutang, the giant who advocated humor as the orthodox, did not expect.</p>
<p>Whether humorous works have value is a matter of public opinion. I believe that "highly serious" works and "sweet stabs" of gentle mockery, allowing people to feel like they want to cry but cannot, want to laugh but cannot, is another style of literature. Sima Qian's "Biographies of Jesters," which says, "Their subtle and pointed words could resolve disputes," is originally not blameworthy, and we even welcome it warmly.</p>
<p>But how easy is it? To create a humorous work that is just right is an extremely difficult task. As a result, attempting to draw a tiger but failing and resembling a dog instead, leads to the production of boring and low-grade works. This causes people to become irresponsible, taking pleasure in making frivolous jokes, with one person starting it and a hundred following suit, using precious time for meaningless work. "Purity" and "leisure" may lead to national demise.</p>
<p>But we must investigate where this humor originated and why it suddenly surged. This is also due to the relationship with the era's environment. The Jin people were not born fond of pure conversation, nor did they like to renounce the world. Because there was no way out in the environment, they had no choice but to use wind, moon, poetry, and wine to kill time. Present-day China is indeed an extremely dangerous era. Being Chinese does not mean that everyone is a bloodless man. Those with blood and energy cannot express themselves properly, so a portion of people without the courage to overcome the environment turn to humor and jest. This is also not surprising. In Mr. Xu Yu's open letter to Mr. Zhu Guangqian, I feel that a few sentences are fair, and it is worth transcribing them as follows:</p>
<p>"I also believe that the most sound ideal is multifaceted development, but I do not oppose a person's private preferences. At the same time, in cultural history, we often know that there are sometimes fads and popular things. Observing this phenomenon with an objective attitude also has a necessary background. Speaking coldly, the periodicity of these waves is also very interesting. People like Yuan Zhonglang were suppressed in the Qing Dynasty, and it is normal for them to raise their heads now. Soon it will naturally calm down to a suitable listed price. I don't know what to use to explain this phenomenon. Perhaps it is a kind of property? Or perhaps it is the evolution of the dialectical thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. In short, this kind of thing has a necessary waxing and waning, and naturally human power can promote its early birth,</p>
<p>and can also promote its early death. …</p>
<p>The rise of humor and the raising of Yuan Zhonglang's head are originally ordinary things, but it is unnecessary for them to become a trend. Moreover, because of imitation and vulgarity, the drawbacks are not few. Mr. Zhu Guangqian explained this very thoroughly. In his open letter to Mr. Xu Yu, there is the following explanation:</p>
<p>"I have the same feeling about the late Ming essays. It itself is very fresh, but after many people imitate it, it becomes a kind of gentle tone. I have always believed that in art, a person has his own unique insights. If he does not have his own unique insights and specializes in imitating someone else's unique style, it is okay to do this as an exercise in childhood, but if he treats it as a serious career, then it seems unnecessary."</p>
<p>I believe that Mr. Zhu Guangqian's open letter is the most sincere in pointing out the meaninglessness of the humor school and the unnecessity of advocating late Ming essays.</p>
<p>Following the publication of "The Analects," there were also "Ren Jian Shi" and "Cosmic Wind." "Ren Jian Shi" and "Cosmic Wind" can be said to be sister publications of "Shen Yu" ("The Analects"). "The Analects" has been published for 83 issues, with a history of three and a half years. The trend of humor has lasted for so long, which must be considered the effort of Mr. Yutang and others. "The Analects" was initially edited by Lin Yutang and Tao Kangde. Later, because he developed "Ren Jian Shi," Yutang handed it over to his assistant Kangde to edit.</p>
<p>"Ren Jian Shi" was edited by Lin Yutang as the editor-in-chief, and Xu Yu and Tao Kangde as editors. However, after 42 issues, for some reason with Liangyou Book Company, it finally did not continue to be published.</p>
<p>From the 83rd issue of "The Analects," Tao Kangde withdrew, and Yu Dafu and Shao Xunmei edited it. Now, the orthodox direct line only retains "Cosmic Wind." (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Confucius</h3>
<p>— Du Xiu</p>
<p>Compiled by Tong Xingbai, one of the "Junior High School Student's Literature Series," published by Zhonghua Book Company.</p>
<p>Blind worship and blind opposition are equally eternal sinners in academics. Regarding Confucius, he has been blindly worshiped by people for thousands of years, but he has also been unreasonably attacked and cursed by people. Those who worship him rarely conduct detailed research on Confucius's doctrines, and those who attack them are even more unwilling to understand Confucius's doctrines rationally. As a result, in today's Chinese society, the following phenomenon has been created regarding Confucius: those who oppose Confucius scold those who revere Confucius as restorationists, reversing the course of thought; those who revere Confucius scold those who oppose Confucius as extremists, poisoned by thought. Such people who criticize blindly without seeking thorough understanding, whether they revere Confucius or oppose Confucius, are not only sinners against Confucius but also moths in the academic world!</p>
<p>Therefore, no matter which great thinker, great politician, or great educator's doctrines we study, we have absolutely no reason to criticize them arbitrarily unless we thoroughly research their thoughts and doctrines before making a judgment. Otherwise, this criticism is definitely not genuine criticism but blind abuse.</p>
<p>Confucius is a great politician, great educator, and great thinker who has been unanimously recognized in China for thousands of years. However, there are simply no specialized books that thoroughly research and systematically discuss Confucius's sayings. We cannot consider this a big joke. Moreover, it is not just a joke, it is simply a great shame in the Chinese academic world!</p>
<p>Mr. Tong Xingbai compiled a book entitled "Confucius" in the "Junior High School Student's Literature Series" published by Zhonghua Book Company. Although it is only a separate volume of about 50,000 words, it has already made precise and careful descriptions of Confucius's life and the content of his doctrines. We cannot but recognize this as a matter worthy of joy.</p>
<p>In this thin booklet, we only need to look at the compilation and classification of its chapters to understand its breadth and depth. The first part is "Confucius's Life and Environment." In this part, Confucius's family background, childhood, adulthood, and old age are discussed without omission. What is particularly noteworthy is that the historical background, political background, social background, and ideological background of Confucius's time are also analyzed one by one. This scientific research method is already worthy of our attention, and the detailed and profound analysis makes us unable to avoid reading it. The second part is "Confucius's Philosophical Thought," which is the most important part. Most people who study Confucius's philosophical part often focus on Confucius's philosophy of life, political philosophy, and educational philosophy, etc., and mostly omit the details of Confucius's philosophical method. The reason for this phenomenon, of course, is that the part of Confucius's philosophical method is really too difficult. In fact, if we do not understand Confucius's philosophical method, we cannot accept the most profound part of this great thinker's learning and conduct, and we cannot be considered to understand Confucius or study Confucius's doctrines. The book specifically elaborates on the "Confucius's Philosophical Methods" item, detailing the principles of Confucius's philosophical methods of consistency, adaptability, the mean, rectification of names, and the measuring square. This point should be given serious attention. The third part is "Confucius's Immortal Career," which specifically lists Confucius's political achievements, literary achievements, and educational achievements. This part, when read in conjunction with Confucius's life history, can give us a clearer understanding of Confucius. The fourth part is "The Great Confucius." The content of this part is entirely about the profound and lasting influence of Confucius on later generations, whether in political or social aspects. Therefore, if we can carefully read this single volume, those who have a deep understanding of Confucius can benefit from mutual comparison and research; those who have no knowledge of Confucius can gain a general outline of Confucius.</p>
<p>The author believes that the most admirable point of the book is that the argument is very objective and there is no stubborn prejudice at all. This is, of course, the fundamental condition for studying all academics, but in the attitude of today's Chinese people in studying Confucius, it is a treasure that is lacking. The author hopes that junior high school students, college students, adults who revere Confucius, and progressive elements who oppose Confucius will all come and read this "Confucius" to know that blind worship and blind opposition are equally eternal sinners in academics.</p>

<h3>Leukorrhea and White Discharge are the Obstacles to Relationships</h3>
<p>— Original text by German Scblagenhaufer, abridged and translated by Dr. Yang Daonan, a graduate of the Russian Labor Medical University.</p>
<p>…Loss of happiness between husband and wife not only makes it difficult to have children, but also brings no joy…To eliminate gonorrhea, one must rely on fundamental benefits and listen to the guidance of a doctor.</p>
<p>The footprints of gonorrhea have spread to every corner of the universe, every country, and every class. The atmosphere is filled with gonorrhea. This is not an exaggeration. We only need to look at the dramatic increase in gonorrhea statistics in hospitals and the rise of VD hospitals, which are excellent proofs.</p>
<p>Whenever a person suffers from gonorrhea, whether married or unmarried, they are often deprived of their natural rights regarding the opposite sex. Because if the patient does not get treatment, they will be chronically ill for life and simply cannot get married. If they have a wife and are suffering from gonorrhea, then they cannot carry out sexual life between husband and wife. Otherwise, it will cause health disputes for the wife, causing her to develop leukorrhea and ruining her lifelong happiness. Moreover, in men suffering from gonorrhea, the prostate, testicles, and seminal vesicles are damaged by gonococci, thus preventing them from having children. In women, the uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes are also unable to conceive due to the effects of gonorrhea. Therefore, to avoid the arrival of these tragic facts, one must fundamentally seek to eliminate the benefits of gonorrhea. Once gonorrhea is eliminated, many inflammations and complications of the reproductive organs, such as arthritis, will be completely eliminated.</p>
<p>According to my (the original author) investigation at the German Medical University Graduate School, many famous professors, such as doctors Bumm and Weiss, confirmed through experiments that only the "Kelinong," a sacred medicine for gonorrhea, is an effective agent for treating gonorrhea and leukorrhea. Because it is made of a combination of protein and purified pigments. Its special effect of treating gonorrhea has long been shocked by doctors all over the world! For all men and women suffering from acute gonorrhea, use this medicine. Women can also use "Karushadi" externally, inserting one or two tablets into the vagina every night, which has a hundred benefits and no harm.</p>
<h3>Underdevelopment and Impotence are Fatal Wounds for Men</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yang Daonan</p>
<p>How can one increase his wife's pleasure?</p>
<p>For a healthy man, his good development is beyond doubt. Especially the development of the reproductive organs is a necessary condition for every healthy man. If the penis, testicles, prostate, and seminal vesicles can all be fully developed, this is because there is a hormone liquid in the body that promotes the overall and sexual development. If adolescents commit masturbation or have too much sex, or have congenital deficiencies, the hormone will inevitably be lacking, and development will be incomplete, making it difficult for sexual life between the sexes to achieve perfection. Premature ejaculation and impotence put you in the most tragic situation. The other party will also be unable to enjoy all happiness.</p>
<p>When I was at the Russian Labor Medical University Graduate School, many workers nearby were suffering from severe masturbation. They had five or six nocturnal emissions every week. Some had tinnitus, spermatorrhea, forgetfulness, and palpitations. Some even had insomnia and night sweats at night. It was very difficult for them to carry out formal sexual life. Sexual underdevelopment and premature ejaculation made them extremely painful. Divorce cases became commonplace. After I used Merren's German "Buti Kang" to increase their hormones to promote development and radically cure their sexual weakness, and at the same time gave them "Nai Ersi Spermatorrhea Tablets" to treat their spermatorrhea, in most cases, within six or seven weeks, all symptoms and sexual weakness and spermatorrhea were completely eliminated. They regained vigorous spirit and sound development, and everything was extremely satisfactory. These two medicines are absolutely suitable for the Chinese physique and are worth introducing.</p>
<h3>A Clever and Intelligent Woman</h3>
<p>— Dr. Wu Zhonglin, a graduate of Nantong Medical University</p>
<p>Became Erratic Due to Neurasthenia</p>
<p>If we have a clever and intelligent talent, then we will naturally be welcomed everywhere. Especially for women. But a clever and intelligent woman, as a result of neurasthenia, menstrual irregularities, and other diseases, becomes stupid. Moreover, due to the abnormality of ovarian function, menstrual irregularities, and difficulty in having children, both the mind and body are more severely attacked, often turning into a hysterical case of erratic laughter and crying. At that time, the way of husband and wife becomes even more bitter. Other symptoms such as the discharge of leukorrhea are also often seen in this disease.</p>
<p>For women suffering from the above symptoms, I once read the papers of Lister, Datskizky, and other doctors when I was at Nantong Medical University. I learned that taking the "Bunvrong," a medicine invented by German Merren, can be effective for women's menstrual disorders, lower abdominal pain, leukorrhea, and other conditions such as long-term infertility, which can make the menstruation tend to adjustment. As a result, it completes the task of regulating menstruation and promoting pregnancy, can make the nerves tend to be normal, and can restore a clever and intelligent woman. It also makes the muscles delicate and full, removes wrinkles, and has a charming appearance. The reason is that "Bunvrong" can make the entire endocrine function vigorous and restore the state of youth. As for leukorrhea, in addition to using this medicine as an oral medicine, one can use "Karushadi vaginal tablets" as a suppository to sweep away the disgusting white scale. In about four weeks, they are all cured.</p>
<h3>Dr. Yao Juyan's Gonorrhea Lecture</h3>
<p>Clinic: Corner of Siyong Road and Ningbo Road Clinic Hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM</p>
<p>…Elimination of Palliative and Abortive Therapies… New Success of Advanced Cell Anti-Gonorrhea Therapy</p>
<p>Science is advancing rapidly, and medicine is also advancing day by day. Many diseases that the ancients considered difficult or incurable are now solved by the omnipotence of science. Gonorrhea is one of them. In the past, general doctors regarded gonorrhea as a difficult or incurable disease. When the disease occurred, they used palliative therapy. People were often confused by the fallacy of local transmucosal sterilization, or used violent medicines to seek temporary abortion of the disease. As a result, it changes from acute to chronic, from mild to severe, such as orchitis, seminal vesiculitis, prostatitis and leakage, as well as arthritis, gonorrhea angina, and sepsis, etc. Mild cases cause pain and infertility, while severe cases cause life to be lost.</p>
<p>However, since Peter invented the "Kelinong," a mixture of pigment and protein, after taking it, the whole body can exert advanced anti-gonorrhea bactericidal power in a short period of time, and when it encounters a lesion, it exerts a phagocytic effect. Therefore, all gonococci can be quickly eliminated, and the "Kelinong" medicine can defeat any gonorrhea medicine. The previous leukorrhea medicine that called for transmucosal sterilization has also been completely eliminated. I have used "Kelinong" as an oral medicine for many years of clinical experiments. In addition, X-ray electrotherapy and other methods can exert its bactericidal power. According to this treatment, if the patient knows how to maintain health, and if the husband does not fail, not only is my experience like this, but also the achievements of world-renowned doctors who have used "Kelinong" to cure gonorrhea are the same. Therefore, it can get unanimous praise. However, for wives who have also been infected with this disease, in addition to taking "Kelinong" internally, they can use "Karushadi vaginal tablets" as a suppository to cleanse the leukorrhea and prevent vaginal erosion, which will be more effective.</p>
<h3>Reunited After the Broken Mirror</h3>
<p>— Dr. Chen Zongkun, a graduate of the Imperial University of Japan Medical School</p>
<p>Husband and wife have lost their love. How can it be restored?</p>
<p>The phrase "reunited after the broken mirror" has always been used as a metaphor for things that are reconciled after a couple's discord or separation. But if we want to analyze the reasons, many people think that the discord or divorce of couples is due to economic reasons. In fact, they do not understand the truth of love. Aren't we always seeing wealthy families, why are they divorcing or arguing every day? This is certainly not for money reasons, but for love reasons. In other words, one of them must feel dissatisfied with their sexual life. To be honest, maintaining love only requires the word "sexual desire." There is no need for moralists to say euphemistic words.</p>
<p>When I was at the Tokyo Imperial University Medical School, I was very interested in this issue and studied hard. I learned that all men who abuse masturbation during adolescence, or who marry early before they reach the age of marriage, are depriving the sprouting and developing youthful glands every day. Can they still enjoy the normal happiness of sex? Therefore, men and women suffering from masturbation and early marriage with excessive sex have abnormal development of their lower bodies. They are either as small as silkworms or moths, or bent like a bow. The extremely serious symptoms of spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, lack of erection strength, and reduced sexual pleasure all follow. Other symptoms such as mental depression, palpitations, insomnia, headaches, and significant decline in memory also occur. All the symptoms of sexual neurasthenia are gathered in one body.</p>
<p>We should seek thorough treatment for this destruction of the sex glands, that is, to improve the organization of the sex glands. The German Doctor Merren's invention of the male "Buti Kang" is the first great success in the treatment of sexual neurasthenia. He selected hormones from brave and strong animals and made them using a new scientific method. After many successful animal experiments, he further researched and modified them into oral medicines for humans. Therefore, the greatness and durability of the effect of "Buti Kang" can be proven by all doctors and patients who have used "Buti Kang." This medicine can strengthen the reproductive system, promote sexual development and increased pleasure, and all serious symptoms such as spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, and inability to erect will naturally be cured invisibly. Since healthy sexual function has been obtained, the love between husband and wife will naturally be strong and like glue. However, one must still pay attention not to abuse "sexual desire," so that physical health can be maintained for a long time without drawbacks.</p>
<h3>The Only Vital Resource of Life is Diet</h3>
<p>— Dr. Chen Shaohua</p>
<p>A Healthy Person Needs a Better Stomach to Replenish the Exhausted Body</p>
<p>How Should People with Poor Appetite and Indigestion Be Urgently Treated? A biological organism cannot maintain life without nutrition. Similarly, the activity of human beings depends entirely on the nutrition of food. The large amount of food intake by rickshaw pullers and coolies is a good example. The amount of food depends on the degree of labor (mental and physical). Losing a certain limit will cause malnutrition, anemia, and weakness. Therefore, Europeans who pay attention to hygiene believe that "Strong Stomach Essence" is an essential product for the family. Because it can greatly increase appetite.</p>
<p>This is true for healthy people, and people with stomach problems should try to cure it even more. We see those stomach patients who cannot eat something happily all year round. They either have pain after eating, or they have bloating and discomfort, belching and burping on weekdays. Acid reflux and nausea are painful and terrifying. Ordinary preparations do not have the ability to treat these symptoms! Only "Strong Stomach Essence" can take care of both. Doctors who have graduated from domestic and foreign medical universities have fully proven its actual effect. It has unparalleled achievements in treating bad breath, bitter mouth, abdominal pain, intestinal noise, constipation, and diarrhea, etc.</p>
<h3>Spermatorrhea and Spermatorrhoea</h3>
<p>— Dr. Chen Zongkun</p>
<p>Dream of Happiness but Wake Up with Sorrow - Crisis of Young People</p>
<p>To be a healthy citizen, and to hope to stand up in society in the future and make a great career, young people must first pay attention to whether their physique can bear this responsibility. In fact, most young people now have the bad habit of masturbation, wasting precious hormones every day, leading to premature aging. The main symptoms are many vivid dreams, and waking up feels unhappy. Spermatorrhea gradually progresses to spermatorrhoea—color drains the essence, semen leaks, and the body becomes thinner and thinner every day, the complexion is as yellow as the mast wax, and the lips and nails are dull, showing extreme anemia. If treatment is not carried out early, the erection central nerve and the ejaculation central nerve will lose their function, and the nerve of pleasure will also be lost due to paralysis. We should all analyze and deal with this. Absolutely do not use violent drugs to achieve temporary satisfaction.</p>
<p>"Nai Ersi Spermatorrhea Tablets" are good at suppressing the virtual excitement of nerves, consolidating sperm tubes, clarifying desires and eliminating the bad habit of masturbation. Therefore, after taking this tablet, it can be cured in a few weeks. However, if spermatorrhea has been present for a long time, a large amount of hormones will be lost. Insomnia, forgetfulness, and palpitations can be taken at the same time as "Buti Kang." There is a wonderful effect of using two methods at the same time to complement each other.</p>
<p>A Study of Excerpts from the Dream of the Red Chamber</p>
<h3>A Study of Lin Daiyu's Pulmonary Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>— Dr. Deng Yuanhe, Former Professor of Nanyang Medical University</p>
<p>...Her frequent illnesses and melancholy worried Brother Bao immensely! ...How could Sister Lin, suffering from "consumption" since childhood, live to be sixteen?</p>
<p>"One Hundred Questions About Consumption" - II</p>
<p>In two previous issues of this publication, we discussed the section about Jia Baoyu's maid Qingwen dying from "daughter's consumption." In describing consumption, Cao Xueqin, the author of Dream of the Red Chamber, truly reached a level of divine craftsmanship. Especially Lin Daiyu's consumption, reading it makes one feel like a firsthand witness. We now ask: Sister Lin has suffered from consumption since childhood, hence her frequent illnesses and melancholy; but why, with illnesses every three or five days, did she live to be sixteen or seventeen years old before dying? This is a question worthy of attention. I remember when I was teaching at Nanyang Medical University, I often discussed these questions with students after class. I believe that while we don't need to worry like Jia Baoyu, from a medical standpoint, Sister Lin's illness can indeed be studied by those undergoing treatment for lung disease. The reason she was able to live to sixteen or seventeen years old was because she did not overwork herself and mostly rested in bed. The surroundings of her residence were also spacious gardens with fresh air, which enabled her to resist the tuberculosis bacillus and prolong her remaining life. Unfortunately, due to the lack of effective drugs, she still died in the end.</p>
<p>Therefore, all men and women suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis should first seek effective drugs to eradicate it. Relying solely on recuperation is not useful. In 1926, American lung disease expert Dr. Grove Kind, affirmed that pulmonary tuberculosis, with symptoms such as hemoptysis, hectic fever, night sweats, coughing, chest pain, and expectoration, can only be quickly cured by absolutely taking the specific drug "Bu Fei Na Er," which can surround the tuberculosis bacilli within a short period of eight to nine weeks. As for male lung patients with premature ejaculation, impotence, and back pain, they can also take "Bu Ti Kang." For spermatorrhea, take "Nai Er Si Spermatorrhea Pills." For female patients with irregular menstruation, menstrual pain, or amenorrhea, take "Bu Nv Rong." For leucorrhea due to physical weakness, use "Ka Er Xue Di" externally. Furthermore, "Bu Ti Kang" and "Bu Nv Rong" can also cure neurasthenia and insomnia in both male and female lung patients!</p>
<h3>Gonorrheal Urethral Abscess</h3>
<p>— Dr. Song Zhongyu, Graduate of the Army Medical University</p>
<p>Painful Urination Like Being Cut with a Knife, Flow of Pus and Blood</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Xu Shitai, aged twenty-six. Originally a gentle and refined person, one night after returning home from a dance hall, he was induced by a friend to enter a brothel and suddenly contracted gonorrhea. Mr. Xu, being impatient to get well quickly, recklessly tried various medications and surgical procedures. (Sometimes changing doctors several times a day and taking various over-the-counter drugs). Unexpectedly, the disease not only did not improve but worsened. His urethra, due to reckless surgical procedures, became increasingly inflamed, suppurated, and formed an abscess (see the first circle). Furthermore, because the pus blocked the urethra, urination became extremely difficult and painful, like being cut with a knife. Pus and blood often flowed from the urethral opening. This was truly a case of gonorrheal urethral abscess. After slightly washing the area, I prescribed the German specific drug for gonorrhea "Ke Lin Nong" to be taken internally to fight gonorrhea, kill bacteria, reduce inflammation, prevent decay, promote urination, relieve pain, and reduce swelling. After taking it for three weeks, the inflammation had subsided by seventy to eighty percent, and urination was much clearer. However, there was still some discharge. I instructed him to continue taking "Ke Lin Nong" without interruption. After taking it for two more weeks, this difficult and dangerous case of gonorrhea was completely overcome and cured. The tissue in the urethra returned to normal, with no traces of lesions (see the second picture). I must deeply thank "Ke Lin Nong" for its great and appropriate efficacy, as many gonorrhea drugs can promote urination but not reduce inflammation, kill bacteria but not prevent decay, relieve pain but not reduce swelling. Only "Ke Lin Nong" has these multiple effects.</p>

<h3>After the Autumn Cool</h3>
<p>— Dr. Wu Zhonglin</p>
<p>Young People Must Be Careful to Prevent Colds and Coughs, the Elderly Must Pay Attention to Relapses of Asthma and Phlegm Retention, Children Must Pay Attention to the Dreadful Whooping Cough</p>
<p>As we enter autumn, how to nourish the lungs becomes an important issue. Careless health maintenance and exposure to coolness at night will first affect the respiratory system, leading to colds, coughs, and excessive phlegm and mucus. Without effective treatment, there is a risk of prolonged coughs and internal damage, leading to consumption. The elderly, whose lungs are inherently weak, are prone to asthma attacks with sudden changes in air pressure in autumn, even with careful health maintenance, leading to shortness of breath, expectoration, and restless sleep. Children's lung metal is inherently weak, and autumn dryness prevails, making them prone to whooping cough. For all these conditions, it is advisable to quickly take the only specific agent for nourishing the lungs to prevent problems before they occur and treat diseases once they develop. After graduating from the Army Medical University, I have repeatedly used the only specific agent for nourishing the lungs in clinical practice and achieved remarkable results, curing many people. If hormone preparations are taken simultaneously to nourish the whole body, it will be even more appropriate. The only specific agent for nourishing the lungs "Bu Fei Na Er" is best at suppressing coughs, eliminating phlegm, calming asthma, and calming the mind. The hormone preparations for nourishing the body, "Bu Ti Kang" for men and "Bu Nv Rong" for women, have special effects of boosting physical strength, nourishing the brain, and nourishing the blood, with a noble character and no drawbacks.</p>
<h3>Reader's Corner</h3>
<p>— Letter from Mr. Sun Dawu</p>
<p>"Harmful Habit of Masturbation Destroys Vitality"</p>
<p>Editor: I unfortunately committed masturbation when young, excessively depleting my essence, and then suffered from spermatorrhea. I had nocturnal emissions as often as five times a week, with occasional seminal leakage. I suffered from headaches, palpitations, tinnitus, and forgetfulness. Insomnia and night sweats were common. After getting married in 1929, the symptoms worsened, and I eventually became impotent. Even when I could engage in intercourse, it was difficult to last. Not only did symptoms of neurasthenia appear, but I also had phimosis. My genitals were as small as a child's. Because of this, I was disliked by my wife! Last spring, on the recommendation of a friend, I took "Nai Er Si Spermatorrhea Pills" and was cured of spermatorrhea, which has not recurred since. Later, Dr. Yao Juyan performed a circumcision, which was painless. I also received electrotherapy every other day. At the same time, I took "Bu Ti Kang" to promote development and treat various symptoms of weakness. In about four weeks, I gained weight. After taking it for a month, my genitals developed abnormally well. I am extremely grateful, and my wife's life is also very happy.</p>

<p>Supplement to the Shanghai News</p>
<p>Talk</p>
<h3>"Asianization Flowing Westward!"</h3>
<p>— Wu Ci</p>
<p>"Asianization Flowing Westward!"</p>
<p>Writing these four words out of nowhere might strike the reader as odd. But it’s not really out of nowhere: three female artists, in order to "promote our country's beautification (not culture)," applied to the Ministry of Education for subsidies, which have now been approved. With approval granted, they could have packed their bags and set out to "promote" it. However, it’s said that the petition, “written in balanced prose, with excellent emotion and rhetoric,” needed to be published. After reading it, I’m now excerpting a few passages here to express my admiration:</p>
<p>"Humbly considering that we lack the talent of Xie Daoyun, but are aware of the global intersection of the world, and can promote the progress of the art world, European customs have long permeated eastward, so Asianization can naturally flow westward, adhering to the orthodoxy of the original sect, and creating a fixed view of European and American eclecticism, fearing the inability to bear the burden of countless lost threads, and hoping for the greatness of the future with small youth... returning home upon successful completion, repaying the kindness of parents with the heart of an inch of grass, taking up the pen to travel abroad at this time, receiving the benevolence of the sweet pear tree..."</p>
<p>Reading this entire "emotionally and rhetorically" powerful article from beginning to end, it is indeed sonorous and affecting, with the sense of lingering for three days. However, whether it is "lacking the talent of Xie Daoyun," "valuing the global intersection," or "small youth," only this "Asianization can naturally flow westward" requires considerable deliberation.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>What should be considered first here is what "Asianization" is. If "Asianization" is an abbreviation for "Asian culture," it seems that Chinese culture this time is undoubtedly representing Asia. Regardless of whether others acknowledge it, we should also look in the mirror. What exactly is modern Chinese culture besides ancient times? If there is nothing, then how can this "Westward Flow" flow? If "Asianization" is not regarded as "Asian culture" but only as "Asianize," such as "concretize," "clarify," etc., this word "ize" has the meaning of a verb, then it means to make Westerners become "Asianized" or "Asianized into Chinese," telling them to abandon airplanes and ships and instead ride Chinese sailboats and ox carts, telling them to abandon electric lights and running water and instead light truly Chinese-style "oil lamps," and draw water from ancient wells: telling them not to send wireless telegrams or watch movies, but to use Chinese "messengers" and watch local operas in ancestral halls: telling them to grow their hair and wear a braid, telling them to take off their high heels and bind their six-inch round feet into three-inch golden lotuses.</p>
<p>To be honest, modern Chinese culture is no longer domestic. We should admit our lack of progress and humbly accept it, perhaps being able to "catch up." If we still hold on to the prejudices of "barbarians" and "Chinese," thinking that Chinese culture developed the earliest, and that no matter how much others progress, it is not worth mentioning, ultimately, it will inevitably lead to cultural disintegration and then stop.</p>
<p>Taking art as an example, I don't know what Chinese painting has that is worth "officially promoting" abroad, or what can represent "Asianization" and "flow westward"? The mountains, rocks, thatched cottages, water buffaloes, herdsboys, flowers, and plants painted by the ancients hundreds of years ago are still the same set in the hands of modern people, and they also arrogantly inscribe things like "imitating the brushstrokes of the Song and Yuan dynasties," making foreigners think that China is still stuck in the 15th and 16th centuries, an era that knew nothing about the world, that China is a backward country, and that the Chinese nation is the least progressive nation.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>This is simply "showing ugliness" rather than "promoting."</p>
<p>Since it is "small youth" and the "future is great," then humbly study abroad, "promoting" I think there is no need to bother, and "Westward Flow" is absolutely not allowed to "flow."</p>
<h3>Village Chief</h3>
<p>— Shi Xi</p>
<p>In my memory, the two people who left the deepest impression on me are Wang Zicheng and Wang Baodong.</p>
<p>Wang Zicheng was a man in his thirties, thin and tall, about four feet tall, often wearing a long white-grey bamboo cloth shirt, and always wearing double-strand straw sandals on his feet (woven from thread and bamboo hemp). Regardless of sunny or rainy days, it was always those straw sandals. Only at the end of the lunar year would you see him change them.</p>
<p>In the village, he was the commander of the militia team, and he carried himself with great authority. However, he treated my mother like family. He and Wang Baodong were mortal enemies. Why? He couldn't say it himself, but when speaking to my mother, he would start cursing angrily!</p>
<p>"Damn it, that piece of dog crap Wang Baodong should just be called Wang Jindeng." Then, he would recount his crimes in an indignant voice: "His heart is blacker than coal. He embezzles at least half of the public funds before handing them over to the district office, yet he claims to be selfless. He doesn't do any work all day. Otherwise, where did he get the money to build that big house and buy that leather coat?..."</p>
<p>After venting his anger enough, he would carefully warn:</p>
<p>"Old lady, these words should only be known to you and me, don't say them out loud. I have no grievances or hatred with him, Wang Baodong..."</p>
<p>Wang Baodong, like Wang Zicheng, often came to our house to talk to my mother and clear his name. In secret, although he didn't know what bad things Wang Zicheng was saying about him, he was afraid that he would take away his position as village chief. He always had a smile on his face when he spoke, and always addressed my mother as "old lady, old lady." Sometimes he would call out angrily for no reason:</p>
<p>"Wang Zicheng, that dog-hearted man, I don't know how many private buns he's sold, and he's involved in smuggling salt and cattle (evading customs duties). Sometimes he goes out at night with those men from the militia team (called Zhuang Ding Dui in Sichuan), supposedly to stand guard, but secretly they go to "catch night snails" and rob those wealthy farmers and small landlords..."</p>
<p>Sometimes they would meet in our house, both with smiles on their faces, exchanging pleasantries and being as polite as brothers. My mother often said that they were just temporarily upset and that they would be fine after a few days.</p>
<p>But behind their backs, they would say bad things about each other, pounding their chests and recounting the other's sins.</p>
<p>One day, we were sending my mother back to the city, and were talking excitedly about a small matter when we suddenly heard a shout from behind. Looking back, we saw Wang Baodong, who was also going to the city. He shouted loudly:</p>
<p>"Old lady, why don't you take a sedan chair? How are those sedan carriers supposed to make a living?" He then said in a low voice, "That dog-hearted Wang Zicheng caused trouble again last night. Does he think I don't know that cattle smugglers are leading cattle past the edge of his dam?"</p>
<p>After saying this, he smiled and left.</p>
<p>Not far away, we ran into Wang Zicheng, who was hurrying from another village, his face looking very bad. He angrily complained:</p>
<p>"Wang Jindeng, that bastard, is saying bad things about me outside. Old lady, if you hear anything, please don't believe him."</p>
<p>At eight o'clock in the evening, everyone had just finished dinner, and the farmhands were washing their hands and feet in preparation for going to bed. Uncle Tai'an, who smoked opium, was lying in bed puffing smoke, and we were all gathered around him. On the field road, a kerosene lamp illuminated our front gate wall. Someone said softly: "Wang Baodong is back..."</p>
<p>But before long, we heard a cry for help flying over from afar. Everyone was shocked. The farmhands, awakened from their sleep, grabbed their tools and rushed out, even Uncle Tai'an, who smoked opium, dropped his opium pipe and ran to see.</p>
<p>Wang Baodong was lying in a pool of blood, already unconscious. In the distance, Wang Zicheng also led several militiamen rushing over. He was shouting for people to carry the body away, while sobbing and saying to the crowd:</p>
<p>"My fellow villagers, our Wang Baodong has been assassinated. This is a misfortune for our village, and also a misfortune for me, because I have lost a powerful assistant..."</p>
<p>As he spoke, tears dripped from his eyes. Everyone shook their heads and said that Wang Zicheng was a good man.</p>
<p>Soon he was elected as the village chief.</p>
<h3>Scenic Area</h3>
<p>— Hu Weixiong</p>
<p>On the second day after returning to my hometown, several close friends took the first bus to my house. My hometown has a high historical status. Recently, after the highway opened, it's easy to travel back and forth from Shanghai in one day. Even this small county town often has wealthy old men coming to patronize it, just like other scenic areas.</p>
<p>Due to my job, I rarely have a few days to return to my hometown each year, and every time I come and go quickly. When the rickshaw pulls through the streets, I only feel that the shops in my hometown have learned the set of Shanghai's big sales, building colored archways, hiring drummers, and I can't see any other reason why this county town has become a scenic area.</p>
<p>But my friends have such a request, they want me to guide them on a tour. This is really a difficult problem for me. I left my hometown to study in middle school and it has been ten years. Even if my hometown has any scenic spots, I should also be the one being guided. So I always refuse:</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>Shanghai Postal Administration Mailing Schedule</p>
<p>All branches in Shanghai can send registered express airmail and handle remittances, savings and other matters</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>"Don't I know? It's just that rich people have nowhere to spend their money, so they think of this small county town!"</p>
<p>But they never give up. This time, because I had something to do and returned to my hometown, they immediately came as a group. I immediately found my cousin to come over, he naturally knows more than me. In the morning, we toured the streets for a week, and what we saw were big sales, colored archways, and the same economic downturn everywhere as in other county towns. I wanted to use this reason to hope they would take the afternoon bus back to Shanghai with me, but they asked my cousin to go with them to visit the ×× Garden, the Confucian Temple, the school grounds, and even thought of going to the nearby × Mountain × Peak for a fun outing. These scenic areas have long been blurred in my memory, they memorized them as fluently as if they were locals. As the host, I couldn't refuse at this time. Guided by my cousin, we first went to ×× Garden after lunch.</p>
<p>×× Garden is a private garden in my hometown. When my grandfather was alive, I had been there once, but I can't remember what the garden looked like now. The rickshaw pulled through a small street that could only pass one car body, and then it was all in winding alleys. I almost suspected that our car had left this small county town. How could a local not have been to this place? After circling through another narrow street, we finally saw one of the plaques of ×× Garden hanging in front of a temple-style gate, gold letters on a black background, shining brightly in the sunlight. It seemed to have been hung up recently, right?</p>
<p>Walking through the second house, it was really like a temple, quiet and without a single person. Turning the corridor, there was a moon gate with "Curved Path Leads to Seclusion" written on it, and only then did we hear noisy sounds inside. I was thinking back to whether this was the place when I came with my grandfather, we had already arrived at the four-sided hall. There is a lotus pond in front of the hall. This pond is still in my mind, I once ate two lotus seeds from this pond. Now the lotus leaves have all withered and yellowed, and there are still a few green leaves floating on the water, but they are so small that the so-called listening to the sound of rain on the remaining lotus is useless for such small leaves, and besides, it floats on the water, the rain on it is the same as falling into the pond.</p>
<p>The four sides seem to have been recently repaired, with plaques, screen strips, and low tables, with a few small round tables and wicker chairs set up in the center, prepared for tourists to come here to taste tea and enjoy the lotus. Now although there are no lotus flowers to admire, and there is a sign posted on the side door saying "Residential Area Inside, No Entry for Tourists," the scenic ×× Garden has already been fully viewed, and naturally we have to sit down and rest.</p>
<p>"How is it?" I started asking my friends.</p>
<p>"Don't give up until you reach the Yellow River." One of them answered me: "It's always more elegant than drinking tea at the Deyilou."</p>
<p>Everyone smiled slightly, looking disappointed.</p>
<p>There are many tourists, and there are also Western teachers, because that day was Sunday, and there are probably many who came in their own cars.</p>
<p>We each brewed a pot of tea, and they all wanted to leave before sitting for even ten minutes. However, the opinions were not consistent. Some wanted to see the Confucian Temple and school grounds again, and some also agreed with me to take the 3:30 bus back to Shanghai.</p>
<p>My cousin paid the tea man one dollar, and that honest countryman said with a smiling face that he wanted another dollar. There were five of us in total, and five pots of tea cost two dollars. I said with a smile:</p>
<p>"Isn't this the price of a dance hall?"</p>
<p>"Today is Sunday, please give me a little extra reward," the tea man said with a smile again.</p>
<p>My cousin waved his hand at him. "We are all locals, don't try to fleece us, one dollar is already being polite."</p>
<p>Hearing my cousin's local dialect, he thanked us and walked away.</p>
<p>"Alright." As we stepped out of the gate of ×× Garden, I said to them; "It's not that rich people have nowhere to spend their money, that's why they come here to be fools!"</p>

<p>Mid-Autumn Moon</p>
<p>Yes, the "Mid-Autumn Moon" is particularly bright. The wealthy are celebrating wildly under this extraordinarily bright Mid-Autumn Moon night, drinking wine, dancing, singing, and leisurely telling and listening to "anecdotes of Emperor Tang Ming." But this is only a festival for the wealthy to enjoy!</p>
<p>But what about us poor people? This extraordinarily bright moonlight cannot shine into our pigeon-cage-like thatched or low houses. What's in the thatched and low houses are: emaciated faces eroded by hunger; crying children with empty stomachs; sick people groaning in bed with no money for medicine; fierce eyes of debt collectors at the door; forcing people to go to their deaths!</p>
<p>The Yue Zilin family was driven to the path of destruction. - When the "Mid-Autumn Moon" was particularly bright.</p>
<p>Yue Zilin used to have a fortune of about 100,000, but after a series of attacks, he was unable to keep this fortune and went bankrupt and fell into poverty. However, the lifestyle habits of a fortune of 100,000 made it impossible for him to change his stubbornness even in his fallen state. He was desperate to save face, and he was unwilling to let his second daughter - A Rong (i.e., younger sister) become a maid; but the food for a family of six was heavily burdening her older sister - the eldest daughter, and it was impossible to support them by working.</p>
<p>A Rong is an innocent little girl, but because she is beautiful, she is deceived by the young master of the landlord, Hu Xinmei.</p>
<p>Knowing that this is a deception. It is exactly: "He is tired of playing with those young ladies, and now he wants to make fun of us poor people!"</p>
<p>"You are still young, you won't understand, but you must know that even if they really like you, they will forget you in a few days..." Her older sister is right. Her older sister is a new woman, she is doing the women's liberation movement and negotiating with the masters to improve their treatment. Therefore, the factory where they work is on strike. But for the sake of life, her younger sister was deceived and abandoned, and their mother suffered heavy blows. First, her mother harmed her three or four younger sisters, and then she committed suicide herself.</p>
<p>The younger sister ran out madly. What about the older sister? She is leading the masses to resist those cruel masters!</p>
<p>The father could not catch up with them and returned in disappointment. "Why are you living alone?" Alas! All dead.</p>
<p>In short, such things are happening layer by layer in the city; however, those children are innocent. It's too cruel!</p>
<p>Save the children!</p>

<h3>Two Blockbuster Films Soon to be Released at the Grand Theater</h3>
<p>(1) Frontier Heroic Legend</p>
<p>American Paramount Pictures, this spring, had "Battlefield Heroes" released in Shanghai, which caused a great sensation at the time, perhaps everyone still remembers it. Now, they have produced another film of similar nature. The film is the latest work of the great director Victor, in collaboration with Fred MacMurray. The film features Indians launching sudden attacks, massive sieges with giant stones and poisoned arrows, the intensity of the battles, and the strangeness of the war preparations are even more than in "Battlefield Heroes," it is indeed a work worth appreciating in the new autumn cinema scene, it is said.</p>
<h3>"Passionate Village Teacher"</h3>
<p>Playing at the Great Shanghai</p>
<p>(2) Anthony Adverse</p>
<p>Anthony Adverse is an immortal masterpiece by the great American writer Hervey Allen, which has been translated into a dozen other languages. Warner Brothers of America has now adapted it for the screen. When the company was producing this film, they were very cautious, using all their energy in terms of both money and talent, and it took two years to complete. The director is Mervyn LeRoy, and the leading actors are Fredric March and Olivia de Havilland. After its release, it shocked the entire film industry, and everyone said that it was not only Warner Brothers' best production of the year, but also a miracle of Hollywood. It is now reported that the film has been shipped to Shanghai, and it has been scheduled to be screened at the Grand Theater from 9:15 PM on the first day of last month (Thursday), it is said.</p>
<h3>New Publication Introduction</h3>

With its humor that can relieve worries, its implicit and extremely satirical nature, the clarity of its lines, and the novelty of its composition, it is especially rare among the world's continuous comics.
