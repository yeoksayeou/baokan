<p>中日外交之側面談</p>
<p>總上所言，關於中日此次調整外交之全案，固不及詳知而列舉。然大要各點，為中外報紙所宣傳者。其內容槪況及應付之策略限度，大致已相差不遠。讀者就此消息，隨加研究，亦可略盡推一合十之長。至我之所以應付者，亦試掇傳聞之詞，略述於後，未必敢謂為眞相也。</p>
<p>方此等項目達到我外部之時，外部受上級機關之指揮，自不能不有所請示。本來結結實實一截提案之際，東京同時有宣言，謂此時我國已不許再徘徊於歧路之間，何去何從，必得一結果。然在記者之好事援證者言之，正以為日本此語，大可與去年我國之宣言，相映成趣。我國不嘗宣言和平未完全絕望時期，決不放棄和平，犧牲未到最後關頭，亦不輕言犧牲耶。信是則所謂歧路云者，不必待日方今茲之致詞，而本早為我國意中想像之所及。此在我國旣已有想像之所及，亦卽秉此輪廓，以為和平犧牲歧趨之標的。在此原則之下，當事者應付外來，遂亦意志堅定，以有備無患之精神，謀折衝樽俎之驛策。而所謂對策者亦卽外傳五項之所由來也。</p>
<p>外交周旋本無一定之公式，而亦不憚出以各種之態度。以盡迂回之能事，此本壇玷間所習見者也。在甲階段間，彼旣有口頭之提案，而我亦有口頭之對案，此在趾高氣揚者，自必好出以主觀之態度，因之甲階段之折衝，遂告停止。其所以告停止者，非我之主觀過度，不欲於緩急先後之間，一一痛析其利害，而實為我對策之未為對方所重視。夫國與國間，平等之外交，凡有損對方之主權者，本在不當言之列，今乃更進一步，在我提出以自保主權者，尙不獲對手者之重視，則此後更有何說可以繼續進行。負上級之責任者與負折衝之責任者，如指便臂，具有同感。因之甲階段亦卽在此情況之下，中輟進行矣情況之下，中輟進行矣</p>
<p>中輟之後，對方局勢因呈外緊內弛之象。何以言外緊也。日本軍人方面水陸徵調，劍拔弩張，一面於察北匪軍王英等加以接濟，一面再於上海，裝成極端緊急之模樣。　此事局已至不可終日者，此其以　緊之局開始高壓，冀我就範，無待贅言。至於內弛云者，則彼邦亦有知彼知已之人，明知高壓之道，不易以應付有備無患之人，且外表上之緊急與事實上之交綏，其中程度相去太遠，茍非籌策安全，或轉輕率債事。此在彼斥我方徘徊歧路之術，已將窮盡者，彼亦實已自處於歧路之前。兼之其負與我折衝之責者，留華已有二十餘年，其觀察我目下之應付，較為淸晰。因之亦尙出於愼重，只求能於雲玷間逐步做去，正不必自陷過渡困難之中，以求萬一貫澈之想。在此外緊內弛情況之下，因之甲階段之交涉，雖已停止，而對我側面之活動，亦遂立卽開始，至此側面之活動，試再分方法與策略言之。</p>
<p>甲階段為日大使與我外部之交涉，旣告停止，難於賽續，則必另覓一方法，以開繼續之門。此方法蓋卽日方要求與外交部之上級機關行政院長相接洽。此事在國際通例上言，本非合式，然外交部之談判，旣告中止，別謀途徑，正非易事。而東京方面文武之看法不同，於是在武人整軍經武，文人勒馬懸崖之際，亦不得不妥籌一策，以外開繼續進行之途，內戰褊激之口。於是要求以外交部之上級機關，為交涉對手者，其說大盛。此蓋側面活動之方法，對內所以解揚杚之危，對外所以濟甲階仙之窮也。至其策略，則彼亦何嘗不知要求外交部以外對手之有違常規。決不可　致。因之則活動及於外部以外之他部，以個人為中心，以晤談手段。前席陳詞，連虛帶實，似此不了之局，但有此法，足以幹旋。至我國則仍守去年之宣言，認為和平旣未絕望，自不必輕棄和平，惟具體之條件，乃至折衝之間，此事除負有專責之外部以外，實不能與之接洽，更不能以上級機關之簡人為對手，中經盤錯，意見較為接近，而是時行政院蔣院長亦適由粵抵贛，有一至南京料量政務之必要。夫此事之由斷復續，倘卽以一度晤談為契機，但使不違交涉之常例，不任交涉之對手，則又何必慳其一晤。因之蔣際長在到南京後，遂有八日上午川越之進謁，此則蓋由側面之活動，因之而漸漸入於乙級段矣。</p>
<p>八日晤談前後二小時，私人之談話，固非局外人所知悉。卽偶知之，亦固無庸細為載述也。至揣其大槪，則彼所懇談卽將其所希望之各項，一一申訴，並加附理由，以自文其所希望之極有理由。而我則於泛論大局及兩國關係之外，未置多詞，僅謂一切應仍由負折衝之責任者為之。實則彼於事前側面接洽之結果，旣不必認外部以外之個人為磋商具體之對象，則晤談之際，除申述各項以外，亦不過兼及前途之如何，以至事件之利害關係，初未嘗要求個人為作任何具體之答復。蓋此種會晤，只可謂為私人表示意見之空談，而不得謂為具體之交涉。蓋彼方對我，亦已熟計深籌，在此時機，旣談交涉，終必尋一對手，而此時除負責對手以外，亦無自帝求。則在一晤之後，雖事後回思，感覺彼此所言之僅在大處，似嫌無邊際之可尋。然亦只得信以為對手之資，以觀其推衍之迹耳。</p>
<p>在此乙階段旣經展開以後，於是自僵局之中，又進而入於彼此可以談話之途。因以報傳旣有某日重與外部約晤等紀載。實則目下雖在乙階段中，尙未至乙階段當前之時期，而實不過為籌商之工作。籌商多半近於事務，亦未至一定具體之際，則以事務官任奔走宣說為已足，本不必卽經正面之折衝；蓋事務官之接洽，方式較簡，言論較自由，探討轉較為實際也。萬一各項在無背立國原則之下，而幸得一辦法，則若者可辦，若者不可辦，若者應有專門研究機關之設置，若者由當局者自動辦理，分別籌措，亦或儘此乙階仙，卽可謀得此次交涉之暫告段落。如根本仍屬主觀，意見未由接近，則由乙而丙而丁，以後將如何，始可獲得一辦法，此時殊不易加以預測矣。</p>

<h3 id="c49">意外長訪德 <a href="#c49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>— 朗</p>
<p>最近歐洲形勢的發展。已到了一個極重要的關頭。西班牙叛軍的節節勝利。比利時的官布中立地位。都表明法西斯集團勢力的長足發展。而給予國際和平陣綫以極大的打擊。但最重要的。則爲意德兩個法西斯國家之更進一步的團結。</p>
<p>據外電所傳。意大利的外交部長。慕索里尼的乘龍快婿齊亞諾伯爵。已於二十到達柏林。訪問德外長牛賴特與國社黨重要人物。在柏林勾留二天之後。卽轉赴貝許特斯加登城進謁希特勒元首。雙方會談的內容。據一般觀察。凡是最近歐洲的重要問題。如承認西班牙叛軍政府問題。比利時中立問題。地中海與中歐問題。以及反蘇聯問題。必然都要談到。雙方會談的結果如何。我們現在雖不能預測。但依兩國的同爲法西斯同志及最近的密切關係來說。此次會談的結果。必能增進法西斯集團的團結。而更加靈其對於世界和平的威脅。這是毫無疑義的。</p>
<p>德意兩國之結成共同陣綫是在東非戰爭時開始的。在這時以前。意德兩國雖同爲法西斯的同志。但因爲他們對於中歐利益的衝突却形成了敵視的形勢。但自東非戰爭一發生後。這種形勢就完全改變。因爲意大利的侵略行爲。巳引起嚴重的國際反響。而其在地中海與英國利益的衝突。尤爲嚴重因此意大利就不得不改變其對德的政策。緩和他們間的矛盾而與之携手。藉以增强其對英的抵抗力量了。同時德國自從廢棄凡爾賽和約·羅加諾公約。積極擴充軍備。進行反蘇聯的十字軍運動後。國際地位也已非常孤立。正需要法西斯同志的合作。在這樣的塲合下。德意兩國的結合就開始發展了。最近因爲人民陣綫的抬頭與和平勢力的增長。於是這侵略集團的團結就有更進一步的發展了。</p>
<p>德意的勾結情形。我們可以舉出很多重要的事實來證明。在國聯對意實施制裁的時候。德國就同奧匈等帮助意國。今年初夏意國航空次長伐來將軍又訪問柏林。簽訂德意航空協定。數日前德國舫空部次官米爾樞將軍。也報聘羅馬。七月間德意兩國更成立了重要的政治恊定。同時德奧親善恊定也在慕索里尼的暗示下宣布成立。一掃過去數年間的德奧糾紛。到了最近。親德的齊亞諾外長。又復親往柏林訪謁國社黨的領袖。其意義的重大。當然可想而知。</p>
<p>德意兩個法西斯的國家。不但想緩和他們自己內部的矛盾而建立起密切的關係。同時還拉攏有法西斯傾向的國家。組成法西斯的集團。以與國際和平勢力和民主陣綫相鬥爭。這次德意會談中的重要議題。就是怎樣調和他們內部的矛盾而結成更鞏固的侵略陣綫。依照最捉的情形觀察。齊亞諾此行。也許可以產生重大的政治後果。而予國際和平陣綫以更嚴重的威脅。但是我們同時也得認淸。法西斯集團的內部矛盾。是遲早必會爆發的。如何促成其爆發。那就有賴有全世界擁護和平的人們的努力了。</p>

<h3 id="c133">祖逖 <a href="#c133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>— 如璧</p>
<p>晋朝開國不久，因爲惠帝太昏了，弄得天下大亂，起初有八個親王——趙王倫，齊王冏，成都王穎，河間王顒，長沙王義，東海王越，楚王璋，南王模。——彼此爭權奪利，你殺我，我趕你，鬧個不休。就在這個時候，匈奴左賢王劉淵看見晋朝大亂，正是奪天下的好機會，於是乎便不願意當晋朝的屬國，登了皇帝的實位，國號漢。——因爲劉淵自以爲是漢朝的外甥，以甥繼舅位，所以國號漢。</p>
<p>不久劉淵死了，兒子劉聰承繼了大位。這時晋朝內部更亂得不成樣子。劉聰便呌他的部將石勒劉曜呼延晏數人領兵攻打晋朝，晋兵如何抵得住，懹帝愍帝先後都號漢兵捉去，並且先後被劉聰殺了。於是大江北面的地方，都被匈奴的兵將佔去了。</p>
<p>好在大江南面的地方還安靜，晋朝的宗室，安東將軍都督揚州江南諸軍事，琅琊王睿在南京登基，用了王導等幾個有才幹的人，總算把江南保住了。</p>
<p>這時中國的北方，全在外國人手裏，漢是匈奴人建的國，國都在平陽，（後改國號前趙）；武都羯人石勒，本是劉淵的部將，後來叛了，並且把劃氏建立的國家滅了，國號後趙；此外還有鮮卑慕容氏建立的前燕，氐人張軌建立的前凉，鮮卑人拓跋氏建立的代國，氏入符堅建立的前聚。前秦頂强盛的了，牠幾乎統一了中國的北方，並且還想把偏安江南的晋朝滅了呢。</p>
<p>這個時代，便是中國歷史上有名的五胡亂中華。</p>
<p>祖逖便生這個大變亂的時代裏面。</p>
<p>祖逖，號呌士雅，范陽人氏，還是一個童子時候，父親便死掉了。他的性情很豪爽，慷慨好施，行俠作義。雖然到了十四五歲還沒有把書讀上路，哥哥們都很憂慮，但是他每到鄉裏去的時候，却隨着自己的心意，把一些錢米布帛散給那些貧苦的人，實行「有飯大家吃，有錢大家用」主義。受了周濟的人感謝他，他却說：「你別謝我，這是我哥哥呌我散給你們的，你要謝謝我的哥哥罷。」</p>
<p>祖逖却有幾個好哥哥，他這樣把錢米布帛隨便給人，他們不但不怪他，反轉說他好。因爲他們都覺得錢米布帛終歸是生不帶來，死不帶去的東西，要能善用牠們來幫助入，才是一個大丈夫應該做的事。所以他們努力行義。不久便很得人敬重，只要是知道祖逖弟兄的人，都很看重他們，說他們是將來有大用的人。</p>
<p>一年跟着一年過去了，祖逖的年紀也漸漸大了，他的聲名也跟着他的年紀大起來。一天，祖逖暗想：「現在我有了聲明，但是我的實在學問在那裏呢？道不過是虛名罷了。我只是慷慨好施，行俠作義，便這樣作一輩子，究竟對於國家社會有甚麽好處？方今天下混亂，正是英雄豪傑報答國家的時候，但是沒有應付這大亂局面的才幹，那也沒有辦法。我要做一個有用的人，要學到應付這種局面的才幹，要到書本裏去找這些才幹。我應該讀書。」</p>
<p>於是，祖逖决心讀書，經史子集，只要是有用的書，他都很用心的讀。自己家裏沒有的，便去買，便去借。讀了幾年，祖逖的心裏着實有些道理了。</p>
<p>祖逖有一個很要好的朋友，名呌劉琨，也是一個很英俊的靑年。他們一道畢文練武，一道研究學問，他們都有趕走胡人，恢復中華的志氣。志同道合，所以他們要好得很。</p>
<p>祖逖同劉琨有時因爲在一道學文練武，忘記了時候，夜深了，便在一道安歇。天快破曉的時候，人家養着的雄鷄，便伸着頸項啼起鳴來。祖逖醒來，聽見鷄鳴聲，便推劉琨道：「老哥，你聽，鷄嗚了，這鳴聲對於人是很好的呢。牠在告訴人們：天快亮了，光明快來了，大家起來吧。老哥，我們不要辜負了牠。」</p>
<p>劉琨也翻身起來，道：「正是，我們不要辜負了牠。」於是祖逖同劉琨都拔出劍來，在屋子裏對舞，閃閃爍爍，劍光同燈光混成一片。</p>
<p>兩個人把劍舞完了，在燈下對坐着，休息了一會，祖逖說：「現在八王不和，把天下弄成一團糟，胡人便趁着這個機會攻進來，晉朝　見得命不長了。我們生威一付好身手，學成文武，正應該在這個時候報答國家。縱然晋朝被人滅了，我們也要盡力去復興中華，才合道理呢！」</p>
<p>劉琨聽了，便說；「對了，我們志同道合，要幹都應該去幹。我們以後幹功立業，誰也不要讓誰，看誰先達到他的志向，睢便是好男兒。老哥，你看：中原倚山帶河，好一片戰塲，正是你我弟兄驅逐胡人，馳騁戰馬的好地方呢。」</p>
<p>兩個人對　着，不覺都鼓掌大笑起來。</p>
<p>晋元帝沒有登基的時候，早已經聽得祖逖的聲名，現在在江甫做了皇帝，要想恢復，自然要一些有才幹的人。於是下詔命祖逖做軍諮祭酒，（好像是一個軍師的地位）。這時祖逖已經有心腹干弟兵二百人，個個都是彪形大漢，都是忠義奮發，武聽超羣的人物。</p>
<p>那時元帝剛剛登基，一心在平定江南，還無意渡江北伐，去收復失掉的土地。</p>
<p>一天早朝，祖逖出班奏道：「晋朝弄到現在道步田地，並不是主上無道，也不是百姓們反叛，只是八王不和，自己人同自己人打起來，沒有去守邊境，胡人們才乘虛而入，中原竟被他佔去了。現在中原的百姓們遭了胡人的蹂躪，人人都想中華復興，人人都想官家出兵，他們都可以起來殺胡人。陛下如果能遺將發兵，臣願意做，前部先鋒，渡江北伐，那時中原豪傑必定望風響應，江南的英雄也必定棄家從軍。失地可以收復，國恥也可以雪掉了。聖意如何？」</p>
<p>元帝聽了，很被祖逖的話感動，馬上封祖逖做奮威將軍豫州刺史，但是沒有兵可派，只好給三千疋布，一千人的糧食，呌祖逖自己去招募，便官行事。</p>
<p>祖逖領了旨意，回家略略收拾，一方面呌準個船隻，渡江北伐。朝廷旣然沒有兵可派，祖逛便只帶他部下的二百子弟兵渡江了。</p>
<p>船剛剛渡到江中心，祖逖突然站起來，舉起手來打着船漿，立害道：「祖逖畢命渡江北伐，如果不把中原收復，胡人殺盡，雖死也不過江！如果過江，一定死在江裏！」</p>
<p>祖逖說時臉上很　肅，聲音也慷慨激烈，二百子弟兵聽了，都感動起來，人人庫拳擦掌，恨不得便同胡人打仗，馬上收復失地，雲掉國恥才好！</p>
<p>組逛渡過長江，就在淮陰立下大本營，一面趕造盔甲兵器，一面揭出忠義二字的大旗，招募豪傑·不久，黃河流域，長江流域的志士，投到祖逖麾下已經有兩千人。</p>
<p>祖逖把這兩千人訓練好了，然後進兵，先把那些表面上是民兵，實在是漢奸的雜牌隊伍，解的解决了，投的投降了，才同後趙石勒的部隊正式打仗。石勒的侄子石虎，是天下聞名的勇將，也被祖逖用計殺敗了，胡將個個喪膽。於是黃河流域那些不曾忘掉祖國的百姓們都響應祖逖石勒的兵將鎮守不住，都逃了。黃河以南的地方都恢復了。石勒懼　祖逖的威風，一面派人到祖逖的家鄉去保護祖宗的墳墓，一面派人向祖逖講和通商。祖逖表面上不理石勒，暗中却任隨百姓們通商。於是祖逖兵精糧足，得到機會，便要渡黃河去收復華北的失地了。</p>
<p>不意這時元帝派戴淵來作都督，分去祖逖的兵權；朝庭裏面王敦又同劉隗爭權，說不定要起內亂，祖逖知道內亂一起，便不能冉波黃河去牧復失地了，於是鬱鬱不樂，竟生起大病來。臨死的時候，祖逖嘆息道：一沒有把失地完全收回，便死了，死也不瞑目！」</p>
<p>二十五年八月，於成都。</p>
<h3 id="c134">亞幾默特Archimedes（287-212　B.C. <a href="#c134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— 珧華</p>
<p>亞幾默特是希臘有名的物理學家和幾何學家。他生在西四里島上的叙拉哥（Syracuse）城。他出世的時候，叙拉哥城的光榮時代已經過去，在他的一生中，總是不斷有戰事的。起初是伊比魯斯（Bpitus）國王皮洛土Pyrrhus）帮了釵拉哥攻打迦太基人，後來皮洛士因爲與國的嫉妒和陰謀，憤而率兵回國。那時亞幾默特才祗有十一歲，他已在亞歷山大利亞進了擊校。</p>
<p>亞幾默特靑年時代的生活，我們不很熟悉，祗知道他有一個嚴肅冷靜的頭腦，又在學術研究上費了許多年的功夫，因此才使他得到了日後的成就。</p>
<p>他和叙拉哥皇族有關係，他曾向國王亥厄洛King　Hiero）　說過一句有名的豪語，說如果給他一個立足地，他可以運轉這個地球，但是亥厄洛並不信他的話。恰好亥厄洛王這時替托洛曼王（King　Ptolemy）造了一艘船，但是完工　後，全叙拉哥城內沒有人能設汰把這船駛動。亞幾默特當時便答應擔任這項工作，他於是想出了滑車的組織，可以利用很小的力量，推勳很大的重量。他把滑車安排好後，拿繩子的一頭遞給亥厄洛去拉，這艘不能駛動的船，便很輕快的由亥厄洛拉着繩子下水了</p>
<p>他道一次的成功，使國王對他非常信任。接着第二個難題來了。國王亥厄洛曾定製一頂純金的王冠，要想知道工匠是否摻雜別的金屬在內，便請亞幾默特檢查一下。王冠旣不能打碎，靠視覺來觀察也沒用。亞幾默特想了好久，不能解决，祗得去回復國王，說是沒有辦法。但他是一向好勝的人，這件事不成功，使他很失望。他走到半道時，很無聊賴，沒精打采的跑進公共浴皇裏洗澡去了。當他跳進水裏去的時候，浴盆裏的水便溢出盆外，並目他注意到愈沈沒，他的身體就似乎愈覺輕些。聰明的亞幾默特，看到了這個現象，便大喜過望，跳出浴盆，跑到街道上大呌道，「我知道了！我知道了！」因爲他已經悟到著名的浮力定律了。</p>
<p>亞幾默特因爲有明晰的頭腦，又肯用心思，所以從這個現象裏，很快的推定了一個結論。平常的人，雖然在洗浴時，也看到盆裏的水溢出，也覺得身體似乎輕些，但因爲懶於用心推求，便找不出道理來了。</p>
<p>亞幾默特的浮力定律，說物體在水中所受的浮力，必等於所擠開同體積的水的重量。從這裏，物體民密度或是比重就可以測定了。亞幾默特試出王冠的比重較純金的比重輕，因此斷定工匠摻雜了別的金屬了。</p>
<p>過了幾年，亞幾默特老了，亥厄洛王也死了。繼位的是亥厄洛尼謨（Hieronymus），這位年輕的國王，與世仇迦太基聯合了，反對羅馬。因此羅馬的海軍對鎖了叙拉哥的海港，而馬薩拉斯（Marcellus）將軍率領大軍，圍攻叙拉哥城。</p>
<p>亞幾默特雖然不贊成和迦太基聯盟，但是在國難當頭的時候，他便放棄了個人的主張，利用了他的聰明的才力，想出了種種防守的工具，來保術他的同胞。</p>
<p>上面說過亞幾默特發明了滑車的組織，可以利用很小的力量推動很大的重量，後來他又發明了起重機。這個起重機雖然和現在的起重機不能相揭並論，但是在二千多年前，亞幾默特却用來將羅馬的戰船吊起來，懸至空中，又把牠放下，和水面相撞擊，將羅馬的戰船撞得粉碎，有時他把船吊進城中，放下來讓叙拉哥人把這些羅馬兵　活捉起米。</p>
<p>他又發明了投石機，能射出大石塊，攻打羅馬的戰船。又發明了一種器具，能射出小石塊和碎的銅鐵塊，攻打敵人。</p>
<p>這種種的發明，是帮助叙拉哥人守禦他們的國土的利器。羅馬的軍隊，付見城裏拋出一根繩子來就驚惶失色，恐怕這位老科學家又想出新的方法來對付他們了。馬薩拉斯知道了士氣的沮喪，曉得圍攻是不能收效的，因此便放棄攻城，採用封鎖的方法，斷絕了食糧的供給，這樣，叙拉哥終於在紀元前二一二年降服了，兩年後，羅馬就統治了西西重全島。</p>
<p>當叙拉哥城破的時候，這位老科學家正在埋頭研究，想借科學的發明來救他的同胞。</p>
<p>馬薩拉斯雖然吃了亞幾默特的苦，却很佩服他的才能，因此在城破之日，傳命部下，不准塲害這位老科學家。但他不是一個貪生怕死的人，他早己有心殉國了，所以當着一個士兵闖入他的屋了時，他毫不客劍喝道，「滾開去，蠢貨，不要毀壞了我所作的園！」他故意觸怒了這個士兵，借敵人的劍，斷送了自己的生命。</p>
<p>亞幾默特一生，對於幾何學，靜水力學，機械學都有重大的貢獻，就他的功績來說，他雖死猶生呢。</p>
<p>在幾何學上，他測定了圓周與直抓的比值及圓的面積。雖然同時愛普羅尼厄（Epollonius）也測定了圓周率（卽圓周與直徑的比值）比亞幾默特所測定的更　準確，但是他却把著名的「家畜問　」難釗了愛普羅尼厄，據說這問題的答案，寫成了一本六首多頁的書呢。</p>
<p>在靜水力學上，他發見了浮力定律，並且從牠演繹出其他靜水力學的定律，奠定了靜水力學的基礎。他所著的關於「浮體」的兩本書，更是研究靜水力學者的聖經。</p>
<p>在機械學方面，他的功續也不小，他發見了槓杆定律，製造滑車及原始的起重機。這些和現代人的日常生活，都是有很密切的關係呢！他的機械學的基理論，到現在已二千多年，還沒有絲毫的進步。可以說，我們今日也是他的世界呢。</p>

<p>— 周寒梅</p>
<p>文字是記事抒情表意的重要工具，無論求學治事，都是必不可少的東西。致於文學更可以陶冶性靈，鍛鍊思考，如涵養德行，在靑年訓練上是一種重要的課程，在敎育價值更居首要的地位。我們在歷史上觀察如個朝代的興亡治亂，往往在文學上也充份地表露出來，我們不敢說文學是可以决定治亂的東西，至少它是可以表現某一個時代的精神趨向的。</p>
<p>不過文學的範圍非常廣大，卽以中學校的國文一科而言的選材施敎，都比其他各學科艱難。在課外作業的指導方面，更不容易得到一個適當的辦法。怎樣選擇國學的書籍，來培養文字方面史的基礎；怎樣講求章法風格，來訓練一般學者的欣賞鑑別的能力；怎樣養成發表的能力？怎樣指導學者的寫作？凡此種稱，都是中國幾千年來一般國文敎員深思熟慮的大問題，而直到現在還不能得到解决關於這幾點，似乎太偏重於國文科敎學上的專門問題了，現在且就「觀摩」一項而論，觀摩這方法，在國文科敎學上是最有效的辦法，往往在一位敎員提出了一篇某一學生的佳作給一般同學傳觀的時候，同學們的注意研究和批評，恐怕比讀國文科的敎材還要認眞得多。倘使道一篇文章而刋載在某一報章或雜誌上以後，那諸同學們的羨慕和欣賞，更不待言了；而寫這篇文章的這個學生，那更洋洋得意，引爲殊寵。這種情形，自幼年時代起，一直到晚年時代止，不論古今中外，都是這樣的，不過因他的環境是在變換，而追求的慾望也增厚而已。所以在中小學時代的國文數學，倘使老師們儘量地利用這觀摩的方汰，作者深信，學生的作文成績一定可突飛猛進，並且可增加無限的興趣！</p>
<p>在這裏，我們就應該注意到這「觀摩」的方法問題。倘使僅限於一級或一校，那麽天地旣小，範圍旣狹，自不能收到我們理想的效果。倘能集合全國各中學的學生作文成績於一册，那麼學生之觀摩材料，旣見豐富，而觀摩的興趣，亦增加萬倍，其收效之大，自非一級或一校可比了。</p>
<p>馬崇淦先生在從政講學之餘，忽然大發宏願，爲全中國的中學生謀進修，邀的名家，將國內各中學的學生作文成續詳加評選，對於題材作風，修詞佈意，都有嚴格的標準，精爲取捨，耗費了一年餘的心血，才編製成這一部「全國高初中學生作文精華」一書，筆者瀏覽之餘，深嘆該書編者用心之苦，貢戲之大，對於全國各中學生造福之深。而一般中學校的國文敎員，也將爲之稱便不少了。</p>
<p>該書共分兩部，一爲「全國初中作文精華」，計四厚册；一爲「全國高中作文精華」計四厚冊。在這兩部高初中作文精華中，包羅的文章有一千二百七十四篇，共二百六十四校，　不能將全國各中學的作文成績都搜羅在內，但已可代表中學生的作文成續了。其中有記叙文，說明文，議論文，書後，描寫文，傳狀文，應用文，演購詞，壽文，贈序，哀誄祭文，小說，詩歌，劇本等，包羅萬象，應有盡有，而因選擇之謹嚴，佳作之琳瑯滿目，自亦不容贅述了。</p>
<p>筆者謹介紹道兩部書於於全中國各中學的國文敎員和中學生之前，希望各中學生人手一編，細加閱讀；要知道文字工具的能否善爲運用，對於自己，是一生專業成就的關鍵；對於國家，是一代文化盛衰的鎖鑰，是絕對不能忽視的。</p>
<p>鄰邦的友人在說：「二百年以後中國文字的音義，是需要他們來敎授的。」我們不必憤慨這說話太過於在妄，總之，我國人民對於自己文字之不肯每一個人都細加研究，勤　學習，是一個事實，不容諱言的痛心的事實，「何必來？祗須記」！</p>
<p>「初中作文精華」計四厚册，母部實價二元二角，每册實價五角五分；「高中作文精華」計厚冊，售價與「初中作文精華」相同上海四馬路勤奮書局出版。</p>
<h3 id="c136">課外活動 <a href="#c136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— 陳際雲</p>
<p>－商務印書館出版，李相勗等著</p>
<p>每冊實價國幣三元－</p>
<p>課外活則有許多近代的新敎育家都看作和課內工作有同等的重要，美國狄蒙與彼爾（Deam　and　Bear）曾說：「課外活動是補充及推廣兒童在正課中所獲得的經騐，牠們使兒童的餘剩精力，男女的自然銜動及自負的態度有正當的出路；同時，且發現他們的普通和特殊的能力。敎育的設立不是來創造精力，而是排洩和指導精力。課外活動帮助發展靑年人的天性，使這些夭性能盡量的表現出來。還有就是課外活動使學生的精力向有益的方面排洩，使他獲得良好的公民訓練。」我們由這一叚話就可以知道課外活動的重要。</p>
<p>中國過去的一般敎育，視敎育的目的純爲知識的灌注和道德的陶冶，因此學子所過的讀書生活是十載寒窗，足不涉園，目不窺戶，終日請書，甚至夜以繼日，無所謂休閒；而辦學的人對於休閒的敎育只有嚴格的監視，不許稍給以絲毫自由。中國歷史明白告訴我們，自有史以來，以迄淸季，中國的學校行政制度中從來沒有注意到課外活動，也更夢想不到課外活動。</p>
<p>我國課外活動的歷史，自頭至尾是很短的，雖然發展很快，但至今還是幼稚；雖說已脫離萌芽時期，但仍然是園中一株柔嫩的小樹；正倚賴着健全的組織做牠的根苗，精密的行政做牠的土壤、適當的指導與管理做牠的豐富不竭的肥料，和全體的遊園人做牠的慈善的保護者。我們要時剎刈草，時加灌溉，任其生長，時令一至，當然會結下鮮艷的蓓蕾，美麗的花朶，和芬香而碩大無朋的果實了。</p>
<p>怎樣使「課外活動」逐漸發達？那當然要靠敎育家去研究了。關於研究課外活動的著作，不過報章雜誌上的零星散篇，有系統的著述還不多，近商務印書館出版李相勗先生等編著的大學叢書課外活動，現把該書內容簡略的介紹於下：</p>
<p>第一章　緒論</p>
<p>詳述課外活動的定義，課外活動的種類，課外活動的學理根據，課外活動與敎育的社會目的，課外活動興中國中學敎育目標。</p>
<p>第二章　踝外活動史略</p>
<p>關於課外活動的史略分兩點說明，先說西洋課外活動的史略，分上古及中古時期，近代與現代時期，中國課外活動的史略，分民八以前與民八以後說明。</p>
<p>第三章　課外活動的缺陷及問題</p>
<p>詳述外力所造成的缺陷，本身的缺陷，各中學校長對於缺陷及問題的意兒，各中學學生對於缺陷及問題的意見，缺陷的預防及補救，</p>
<p>第四章　課外活動與各學科的關係</p>
<p>詳述課外活動在各學科的工作中，不特無害，而且能有所助益。從課外活動與學習原理，課外活動與設計佚，課外活動對學業成緒的影響上加以說明。</p>
<p>第五六章　課外活動的組織與行政</p>
<p>課外活動組織與行政的普通原則，課外活動組織的步騾，一般美國中學校課外活動組織與管理的實例，行政之集中與統一，時間的供給，表格的需要，均有詳細的說明。</p>
<p>第七章　學生的參加與管理</p>
<p>詳述學生參加管理的原則，學生參加的管理方法，褫奪參加活動權利的不當，參加的鼓勵，分數制，服務分數與榮譽分數平行制，無益組織產生的制止。</p>
<p>第八章　課外活動的指導</p>
<p>分指導的系統，校長與指導，敎師與指導，指導員等</p>
<p>第九十章　學生自治會</p>
<p>關於學生自治會的目的，學生自治會的歷史，學生自治會的種類，學生自治會的活動範圍，學生自治會的組織步驟，學生自治會的行政要點，學生自治會的特許狀等，都有很詳細的說明。</p>
<p>第十一章　組會與級會</p>
<p>組會存在的價值，組會的功用，組會的組織，組會的活動，組會的指導員，組會的集會時間；級會興學生自治會，級會的活動，級會的組織等，均有詳細的說明。</p>
<p>第十二章　學生週會</p>
<p>詳述學生週會的重要，學生週會的目標，一般的批評，週會工作的範圍，週會秩序的担任，週會的日期與時間，週會秩序項目的分配，週會委員會的組織，由班級輪流主辦的週會，週會的價值等。（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c137">疑古派與社會史派（續） <a href="#c137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— 宜夫</p>
<p>在結論裏，顧氏曾伸說主張，謂社會史派之活潑的態度，我在稱頌的。我不參加社會史的論戰，是能力不足，唯以資料的檢討爲自己的工作而已。我這論文特提供於社會史派，但望不可以先秦諸子的宜傳文書，作爲古代社會的史料，應注意於如沙漢上築樓閣的研究的危險。……</p>
<p>顧氏雖對社會中派放一天，但是好意的，且依然是信賴社會史派。唯在這論文後記所書的到於禹貢學會的楊同奎，明顯地對社會史派抱不信，攙人了固守社會史派舊說的人們。這是疑古派與一部的社會史派離反的表示。</p>
<p>果是疑古派無目的的以疑古爲終止，欲與社會史派相離而孤立的嗎？</p>
<p>又熱中形式理論之一部的性念的社會史學者，在將反省當更活躍於堅固的基礎之上吧？</p>
<p>若社會史派與疑古派打破共同戰綫，這是中國學術界的大不幸的事。惟我相信在學術上之相互討論相互爭執，是應有的現象，而對於古的重新鑑定，總覺得是萬分的重要，還應該向同一目的之分工研究，原是無不可的吧！（完）</p>

<h3 id="c145">粉麥市價昨日盛漲　市場特加限制交易暫行停頓　預測前途漲風一時尚難見止 <a href="#c145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>中央社云、昨日粉麥市塲、發生更勁之漲風、麵粉一日間漲足一角、以致後數盤陷於停頓狀態中、小麥上午尚平平、下午以粉價驟升、亦帶高二角之譜、現在交易所當局、正設法謀暫時安定之辦法、但預測前途漲風尚難見止也、茲誌砟日詳情如下、</p>
<p>漲風盛熾　特加限制</p>
<p>麺粉市場連日漲風已熾、大有扶搖直上之勢、昨日之漲風更甚、上午開盤後、買氣甚旺、而食胃又巨、故半日間、各月份一致上升、竟達七八分之譜、及至下午開盤、漲風仍不見减、旋由交易所當局根據「每日漲價不得超過一角」之規定、加以限制、結果、各月份均漲升一角、遠期最高價爲三元九角零二釐半、近期最高價爲三元七角四分二釐半、自經交易所當局對價格加以限制援、交易卽陷於無形停頓中、</p>
<p>麥受影響　價亦高升</p>
<p>昨日之雜糧市塲中之小麥、於上午開盤時、上落尚不大、各月份的漲六七分之譜、及至下午最援數盤、因受粉價高漲之影響、亦驟起漲風、現貨與標價、均漲至六元、而遠期小麥竟漲至六元六角、近期較前各升漲二角、遠期上升二角五分六釐、</p>
<p>市塲擬謀　穩定辦法</p>
<p>交易所方面、對於此次粉麥價格驟漲一事、現正覓取穩定辦法、對麵粉方面、其證金雖經一度由二百五十元增至五百元、現擬再增至七百五十元、以防投機者之從中操縱、小麥方面、今日將追繳證金、如體金未能追齊、恐將亦停拍、</p>
<p>個中人談　驟漲原因</p>
<p>記者據向粉麥商方面探詢、其驟漲原因、最初因某方收買國粉甚勁、滬地裝運赴華北及束北者、爲數至鉅、麵粉廠商、雖加工趕製、竟有供不應求之勢、最近某方、雖已停止收買、事實上已無貨可資供給、但按今年國麥產量、雖較往年爲佳、但事實上、國內各廠商所用原料、往年每多求給於外國、而本年外麥產最不豐、洋麥進口减少、故各廠商雖於國麥新產時、收買有用、但該項存貨、僅能供應四五個月、下次新麥登塲、尚須九個月之久、故此四五個月援、原料勢威缺少、如以目前情形觀察、粉價前途、尚有上漲之勢、且日來市塲間、時有投機者造謠操樅、此亦使上漲原因之一也、</p>
<h3 id="c146">英大使許閣森　昨晚回京 <a href="#c146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>

<p>彼在二十二年在原籍嘉定、遇被告孫翠蘭、偕其來滬、庽於被告陳關泰處、陳乃起意假名募捐工作、曾偕楊·孫·兩女同往香港、冒名上海法租界藍維靄路上海女子慈善醫院、向各界捐募欵項二千元、由陳按月給付楊英車馬費十元、迨回滬後、又假用平民</p>
<p>婦孺醫院</p>
<p>及福祿醫院名義、四出慕捐、而楊之月薪亦增加爲十五元、嗣楊忽與陳關泰意見不合、於去歲回籍、至本年四月間又來滬、住於牯嶺路一四九號、至六月間、有自稱爲廣濟慈善醫院院長之胡豐民、因素知楊女有募捐之能、乃邀楊合作、聘爲慕捐之專員、四出募化、嗣因外界以</p>
<p>楊女假借</p>

<p>確會被騙</p>
<p>如江西路中國貿易公司·中國·中南·兩銀行·等、均能證明楊·孫·二女前去募捐、惟因所捐之欵大者十元、小者四角、事屬善舉、損失細微、故未到庭、查被告等數年來所犯之案、不能統計、捕房曾接匿名信指明被告等騙得之欵、竟達十萬元左右、今因承辦此案之西探長須赴英公堂爲印捕槍殺案作證、故請准予征期云、傅推事諭張學祥准交三百元保、餘人仍分別還押候改期七天再訊、</p>

<h3 id="c208">健康是兩性歡樂的柱石 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>……當男女發育開始時就需要智識來引導他們跨進人生的樂園　……性機能障礙症是錄削夫婦歡樂的惡魔也是孱弱青年所獨有　……先天不足及婚後房事過度手淫與淋病均為本症的主要原因</p>
<p>一個青年從呱呱墜地而進入兩性生活，中間是經過無數次的生理變化，在這生理變化的演進中，漸漸步入性的範圍內。一般生理學家論斷，當男女發育開始時，就需要一種智識來引導他們跨進人生的樂園，這種智識就是『性智識』。</p>
<p>在親舊交替的中國社會，青年因為缺少性的智識，以致引起不應有的煩惱。在吾人日常頻聞屢見的：就是青年性智識薄弱之結果，而犯上手淫惡癖，致體力　喪，性機能障礙症不能免。</p>
<p>性機能障礙症是孱弱男子獨有的病態，大凡身體強壯的不知性機能障礙為何物，所以永相絕緣！但是這種人是很少的。因此結婚後煩惱的夫婦依然多不勝指！</p>
<p>結婚後的性障礙，大概可分為夫婦生活的倦怠，年齡的關系與病的關係的三種，所說夫婦生活的倦怠期，即為性感的薄弱，不僅不感到興趣與熱烈而且有的竟喪失此種機能，完全不能行房事。次為由年齡的關係而來之性的障礙，分有週期的發現者，與實衰老者，週期的發現者，這是任何人普通所常經驗的，不要以為不可治的障礙。由衰老而來者，純由青年時的荒淫無度及意志薄弱而身染淋病，因此主宰康分健的生殖腺為之破壞，故本症的治療，應明晰其病源，將其完全治好，然後可進入結婚生活，不然非但感覺無味，有時常會惹成家庭的惡果。</p>
<p>人類的身體，是由各部複雜的機關經營生活，如一旦發生性的障礙，則司性能的青春腺（卽生殖腺）定必衰頹，手淫與淋病就是使生殖腺衰頹的主因。此外的先天不足與婚後房事過度，亦能惹起莫大的性機能障礙。關於療法，根據全世界的名醫臨訂實驗，除服真正優秀的生殖腺素制劑『生殖素』之外，實無最較為有效而合於理想的製劑了。此僅指先天不足及荒淫早衰而言。如受淋病之害，則除此製劑之外，應兼服黃色素和伐克辛合製劑『安敵淋』以清除尿道前後及黏膜內外的淋病雙球菌。當余在美時，卽該兩　之攻效，故回國後時藉『生殖素』以治愈千萬的早洩陰萎患者，與『安敵淋』的治淋病不分軒輊。</p>

<h3 id="c209">女子健美必修課　去除皺痕及發育乳峯 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士張君實</p>
<p>……皺痕的產生為女子美容的障礙　……高聳豐腴的乳峯為健美所必需</p>
<p>近幾年來，中國的婦女界雖在極力提倡健美，然而因為科學進步的呆滯，醫學發明的落後，所以依然毫無收獲。假若如果把眼睛望到海洋的那面，我們就發現許多新的動向了。在英法德奧他們已有去除皺痕及發育乳峯的科學方法現現，的確一個女子假若起了面部計怨的皺痕和萎　的乳房，那末無論你穿上怎樣艷麗奪目的服裝，終被他人所嗤笑而目為落伍的女子。反之就能夠很榮耀地使人讚羨。</p>
<p>皺痕的產生是隨著年齡之增加而逐漸湧現，乳房的萎　大都為身體孱弱發育不全的女子所難免。科學家與生理學家明瞭年齡的衰老及健康的喪失完全青春腺（卽生殖腺）萎弱的關系。各國名醫及全世界的著名生理學家力倡生殖腺素製劑女用『生殖素』以強壯生殖腺來預防皺痕及發育乳峯，因效果確實，在各國通商大埠就可以看見失去健美的女人成千累萬排列成行向藥房購取女用『生殖素』從事於科學之補救。該製劑除上述之功效外，能調整月經，故女子一致認此為健美所必需。</p>
<p>戒烟心得</p>
<h3 id="c210">脫離黑籍後　戒煙者的自述 <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— 俞伯符醫師</p>
<p>日前有一姓馬的面色豐腴之中年人來余診所，請求查驗煙癮絕否，經余細加診察，則此人煙毒早無，身體各部均極康健，彼聞言大喜，因自述其戒煙經過，頗足資有心戒除者參考，故錄之於左：</p>
<p>『我十六歲時就會吸煙，到現四十六歲，足足已有三十年歷史。從前在禁綱嚴密的時候，也曾想戒除過兩次，四面八方去覓得了藥方，如法泡制服用，不消幾天功夫，老覺得全身乏力，好像虛飄飄的，身子沒有擱處，煙卻還是沒有戒成。』</p>
<p>去年家鄉（太倉）舉行煙民登記，去領了張執照，回來想想，這至多不過幾年光景，總要嘗到勒令傳戒的滋味的。法令又比以前凶得多，家鄉的縣長又是個絲毫不肯含糊的人，他自己會到處查訪，再要不戒，難免得多吃點苦。</p>
<p>以前的藥方可不願意再試，有上海來的友人說起『生殖素』一藥，據說服食以後可以強身，把給煙毒催殘了的生殖腺恢復健壯，不知不覺的增加抵抗力就會見煙自厭。當時見　心喜，遂連服的兩個月，卅年的宿癮竟離我而去，並且面色紅潤，與前大異，雖中間曾有過遺精，但因見報截而購服了『希米脫氏固精片』也就立卽停止。這次因事來滬，順便來此一診，得到這樣的好消息，心中越發坦然了。』</p>

<p>— 詹念曾醫師</p>
<p>歐陸男兒為什麼盡是氣昂昂雄糾糾的好漢子？　蒼白的性神經衰弱者究竟都怎樣重獲健康？　醫藥界對於保養國家元氣之青年的空前貢獻！</p>
<p>整千整萬的人們，從世界的每個角落裏，踏上了歐陸去參觀在德國舉行的亞令匹克運動會，沒有一個不同聲讚美德意志青年人的健壯。走在柏林街上，那一個不是身軀高大，神采奕奕，挺著結實的胸脯。誰曾在柏林找出過幾個容顏憔悴，面色蒼白的性神經衰弱者樣子的人來？</p>
<p>只要見了這等情形，誰都會知道希特勒何以能建造不世的功業，真的，有了這們結實的青年群，這國家那有不強之理，於是不少人不禁想念到祖國的少年，他們常在開始發育的時候，為友所誘，或為下流書報所惑，猛烈地舉行者手淫，隨著釀成了遺精。這種自覺的惡習慣之成為祖國少年人的通病，早為舉世所週知。結果，我們看見一大批一大批的青年衰弱下去，意志消沉下去，不必再候『友邦』炮火的轟擊，國家的元氣就無聲無息地消磨殆盡了。</p>
<p>不過我們還不用因此而悲觀，一個走馬看花的視察者自然只看見德國青年的雄姿，其實，德國的青年還不是和我們一樣的，大多數也常有手淫的習慣，遺精滑精的疾病，不過以醫為的進步，社會的注意，在發現了這種情形的時候，馬上就設法治療以恢復其健壯。</p>
<p>德國醫藥界對於療治這種病人，都公認以『希米脫氏固精片』和斯丹那博士發明配制的『生殖素』為最有效驗而絕無流弊。因此，這兩種藥在歐陸簡直是家喻戶曉，就是青年自己因耽於自瀆而患遺精時，大都也憬然自悟，趕快購服『希米脫氏固精片』以固精關，再報『生殖素』以培補本元。這樣一來，不知替國家保存了多少的精兵悍卒，準備在未來的戰爭中為國爭光。你不見希特勒進兵萊茵，收復失地嗎？還不是那批青年人的豐功偉績！</p>
<p>祖國的青年們，你們也希望有像德國重取萊茵那樣的一天嗎？要的說話，不要忘了上述的兩種藥，他們曾趕走你的性神經衰弱而使你健壯得像條德國青年一樣的。</p>

<p>診所　四川路北京轉角中國信托公司二樓　門診　上午十時至下午六時，星期日休息</p>
<p>（一）耽於手淫的惡果</p>
<p>患者宣立明，廿一歲，湖南常德人，主訴——早年耽於手淫，引起遺精惡疾，精神疲乏，身軀衰頹，更兼發育不全。病歷：十五歲時寄宿校中，聞劣友描述男女之事及手淫樂趣，躍躍欲試。一度以後頓成習慣，自是無夜或虛，漸感學業退步，記憶艱難，視力銳減，二年以後，頗思戒除，而耽溺難止，且又患遺精之疾，以致生殖機能，橫受摧殘，枯萎不能發育。現在症——全身衰弱，性器短小，遺精頻繁，治療方法：先投以『希米脫氏固精片』以止其遺精，俾漏洩消除，庶無變本加厲，更趨惡化之勢。然後使之購服大量生殖腺素制劑『生殖素』，使其內分泌歸於正常狀態，萎縮之性官得欣欣向榮，重行發育，全身精神亦得充沛，並以電療手術，為之補充，三個月後，諸症一掃而空，性能充足，身軀壯實，頓變為一英俊少年。</p>
<p>（二）遷延不治的遺精病患</p>
<p>患者印國寧，年三十八歲，浙江衢州人，主訴——弱冠之時，頗知自愛，力戒手淫，然每於月儕處閱覽淫書淫畫，心旌搖搖，手淫雖能遏制，意淫終不能免，睡夢之中，有美人抱，遂成遺精之疾，強碩之軀漸為消磨，廿二歲時結婚，以為從此可免，不料又罹早洩之症，遺精亦未克痊，體質日衰，意志消沉，十餘年來遷延不治，雖妻係舊式女子，未致仳離，亦同床異夢，徒存形式，現在症——粗關寬馳，生殖腺萎縮。治療方法——先服『希米脫氏固精片』以止遺精而固精關。更以『生殖素』之內服及電療手術以補虛弱，並治早洩。兩個半月後，全部復原，遺精早洩均止，夫婦得重拾墜　，然已年近中年矣，若當時及早施治，何必忍受此十數年非人之生活。（生殖素有男用女用兩種，均裝鐵盒，服用者不可誤用紙盒偽藥，或弄錯性別，則將反受大害，不可不慎）</p>
<p>白帶無憂</p>
<p>楊君，河北定縣人，其妻體弱多帶，時常淋漓不堪，更引起月經不調，乳房萎　等症，前曾遍覓市上各藥治療，均無效果，近得人介紹，向上海安立思洋行郵購『療帶靈』二盒，用後竟得全愈，來函致謝，並別購『女用生殖素』半打以療其虛弱雲。</p>
<p>胃病自療</p>
<p>蘇州河沿街呂君來函雲：余連年奔走四方，異地食品難於習慣，勉事吞食，積久遂成胃疾，生產疼痛不止，諸醫束手，偶見報載有『胃痛靈』及『健胃素』二藥，初以為廣告故事誇大，不料購服之後，痛止而飯量增，真希世之名藥也。</p>
<p>久婚不育</p>
<p>本埠同孚路胡君函雲：愚夫婦體俱孱弱，結婚以來，憶及四載，未有子息。去冬因人介紹，購得男女用『生殖素』，夫婦分別服用，頓覺健碩，相互間快感驟增，至今未及一年，內子已懷孕五月，誠不勝快慰之至雲。</p>
<p>骨痛常識</p>
<h3 id="c212">腰背酸痛　必須早為治愈 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— 周笑涵醫師</p>
<p>腰背酸痛一症，在抵抗力薄弱者每易感覺。抵抗力的所以薄弱，除先天不足之外，盡為後天失調後所罹患。例如成年時代的　施手淫，或恣意淫欲，精力消耗，體力因此虧損。此外工作不能調節，操勞過度，及起居不合衛生，致染受瘋濕。在青年時因抵抗力尚能相持，故雖病已潛服，感覺尚少，非俟工作過度後，幾全無感覺。一般名醫均認此症為乘人之危的唯一狡病，實為至於名言。</p>
<p>通常體力強裝之人，非至暮年，決不爆發。如在中年時卽已感覺，應早為治療，不然此病症能逐期演進，能使你全身麻林陷於半身不遂之狀。</p>
<p>治療之法，根據專家的臨床經驗，首推『強斯登氏骨痛片』故務國著名醫學雜志，均不惜大字標題為之推廣，該藥功能祛除瘋濕及掃清血毒，自非普通骨痛藥所要號之比並。假若患者抵抗力薄弱，或病後失調及先天不足，同時應以『生殖素』服之，此誠治補並進之良法也。</p>
<p>患者章志恒，年卅七歲，五年前卽感覺腰背酸痛之苦，不加醫治，故近年已陷於全身麻木手足不能動作狀態，始於今年八月間由余診治，服『強斯登氏骨痛片』後，骨節輕松，腰背舒適，衹共服三盒。</p>

<h3 id="c213">淋病擇藥須知 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 香港醫科大學醫學學士吳大超</p>
<p>一個賣藥的人，向一位患淋病睾丸炎的人說：『那有什麼，並不至於釀成大患，讓我給你系上一個好看的懸囊，然後塗上我們所做的幾種油，你照裏晨的仿單去用，病就會好的。『那患者又復問道：這睾丸的腫脹疼痛怎樣呢？』這賣藥的回答說：『那不用我管了，這都是心理作用，我給你安裝好了，自然會消失的。』過了幾天，據他自己說：『這是無效的，所以不久那病人就進醫院裏去了。』</p>
<p>許多年來，我常常看見許多淋病患者，因為治療不當，使病惡化。當我有一天，曾接觸了十個以上的慢性患者，據他們所說，完全因擇藥不慎變為慢性的，可知像上述的事情真是多不勝指。淋病藥中有效的藥品，並非沒有，像全世界淋病專家所推薦的黃色素和伐克辛合制劑『安敵淋』，它的所以勝過一切，因為所含的成分確具透膜殺菌及產生抵毒菌苗，全世界成千累萬的慢性淋病所以必須服此而得根治者，原因就在於此。</p>

<h3 id="c214">拯救和平和自救 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— 黎學濂</p>
<p>據十六日報載，世界和平大會，自九月三日至六日在比京舉行會議之援，曾發出一宣言，「懇請全世界的人們起來積極地保障和平，」這宣言劈頭就說：『第一次世界和平大會，有三十五個國家，七百五十個民族與四十個國際團體的四千多代表參加，這樣，大會得到了宗敎團體，參戰退伍軍人，工會·合作社紕織·智識份子組織·婦女·農民與靑年組織，及保守黨·自由黨·民主黨·社會黨與共產黨等一切和平力量的熱烈贊助，我們共同的口號是：「和平已到了危險關頭，必須拯救和平！』</p>
<p>這次大會的開會期間，恰巧正是歐洲的縱火者們，以飛機大砲來助長西班牙內戰的時候，所以大會的宣言又鄭重的說：「我們以最大的熱望，號召一切未曾加入我們隊伍的人們，起來參加我們的擴大運動，我們的運動是絕對不干涉內政的。我們唯一的目的，就是保證一切民族，不論大小，一律平等地得到和平，我們唯一的敵人，就是蹂躪國際正義而危及世界和平的侵略者！」</p>
<p>目前的火藥氣味已經充滿着全世界，不論是遠東或歐洲，都誠如上而所說！「和平已到了危險的關頭。」在德意葡諸帝國主義所支持下的西班牙的內戰，和五年來底遠東的「不宣而戰，」固不必說；自國社黨紐斯倫大會之後，誰都知道德帝國主義者更在積極地準備着染指蘇聯底廣大的領土了。「和平是不可分割」的，每一個角落裏的事變和軍事政治的動態，都有影響到全世界的安全的可能。所以，世界和平大會無疑的是一個目前非常切要的機構。而世界和平陣綫的鞏固與擴大，戰爭的危機卽隨之而消减，爲了拯救行將爲戰爭所蹂躪的人類，以及人類勞動所集積的成果－－「世界文明，」每一個有正義的人們都有參加保衛和平的義務。</p>
<p>我們目前正受着慘酷的「不官而戰」的蹂躪，這「不宣而戰，」是和整個世界和平有着極密切的關聯的。東方的縱火者並不减於西方的希特拉的威燄。我們爲了擁護偉大的人類的信念，－－和平，我們有權利向這當前唯一的敵人抗爭。</p>
<p>我們要救陷在戰爭中的入類，也要救淪於奴隸殖民地中的我們自己，用我們的全力來衛護這個被人侵略的國家。</p>
<p>因之，在國際上，我們要和整個和平陣綫相連結，在國內，我們要集中了我們任何一派和任何階級的力量，來結成救亡的統一陣綫；一致起來抗拒這亙古未有的人類浩刧！</p>
<p>我們要拯救世界和平，也要拯救我們自己！</p>
<h3 id="c215">烟兌店 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— 蓉</p>
<p>踏出弄口眼前似乎一亮；那空閉着半年來的十幾家舖面，忽然靠弄口的那間門前圍着許多人，新漆的櫃台還蒸發着一種刺鼻的氣味，門前掛着一塊水牌，上面密密地寫着一行行細字，最上一列是香烟的牌子，下面是肥皂，綫團一切應用的東西。有三四個店夥忙着招呼顧客，這難有的熱鬧我頗爲那家烟兌店的老闆幸。因爲我每天踏出弄口，總想</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>着爲什麽沒有人來開這樣一家店舖，住在這弄里一百多份人家都會感到要到對街去兌換錢洋實在是太麻煩，而且上海弄堂住家有許多應用品都是仰給於烟兌店的，無論市面不景氣到如何程度，這塊牌子還是一行好生意吧。</p>
<p>晚上回家，他們還沒有歇業，每天看慣了一排墨黑的板門，獨家店舖撐在那里頗見鶴立雞羣的樣子。這時有一個光頭的中年人在舖里應市，見我是黃包車上跳下來的顧客，滿面春風的招呼我：</p>
<p>「先生住在弄里的？」</p>
<p>我點點頭，隨意回問了一句：「生意好？」</p>
<p>「靠福！靠福！」他鼓着那顆禿頂的腦袋，是中國商人特有的態度，一面數給我兌換的銅板。</p>
<p>這樣，沒有三天功夫，我們已經很熟識了，不論兌角子，買香烟，都要搭腔幾句，而且對我特別客氣，譬如兌角子吧，水牌上雖然明明寫着兌法幣九角九分，他却是給我十足的。開烟兌店的老開是在銅板上扎算盤的，一塊大洋從角子到銅板，和直接兌銅板至少要相差四五枚，第一次他兌給我十角大洋，我覺得很過意不去，另外補了他三枚銅板，但是他無論如何推着不要：</p>
<p>「住在一條弄里，照顧小店的生意多着哩！」</p>
<p>又過了幾天，我每天兩毛錢買慣的兩盒香烟，他另外找了我兩枚銅板，我遲疑着瞧瞧他滿面笑肉的禿頂，又瞧瞧水牌上面，特別用紅粉樣各項香烟的價目，每種都比普通减少一枚。</p>
<p>「减價？我問他。</p>
<p>「大减價！大减價！」</p>
<p>但是說話的聲調和那張笑臉是不統一的，又見他眼光始終瞧着對街，我才回過頭去看看，原來對街烟兌店的水牌上用紅粉標着很大的字，雖然看不淸楚上面的價目，我已經明瞭兩家同業在那里火拼了。</p>
<p>下一天，我踏出弄口就被對街烟兌店櫃台前的一塊大水板吸住了，固本肥皂每塊十四枚九個字都有碗口那末大，這自然又是大拍賣的表示，不過對於這類東西的眞實價格我是棄來不知道的，每塊十四枚比通常要便宜多少自然是莫明其妙。一看禿頂的櫃台前，也是同樣的一塊大水板，是固本肥皂每洋二十二塊，我肚里一算，照兌價三千零十文計　又要便宜七個銅板。</p>
<p>「老關」，買香烟時我問他了：「這兩天的損失不小吧？」</p>
<p>他用手掌從光頭上抹了下來，啐了一口痰：</p>
<p>「眞是死要面子活做鬼！固本肥皂賣十五個銅板還是沒有多少好處－那不過是應應市的，賣屁股，每塊賣十四個！好！一洋二十二塊，算算看，三千零八十。」</p>
<p>他把腦袋搖着，表示阿拉老闆本錢大，蝕脫兩鈿不在乎的樣子。</p>
<p>我笑着走了。</p>
<p>他們每天唱着對台戲，有許多物件連我外行也知道比進價要便宜，有時兌洋的水牌除突然比市面土增高幾個銅板，弄里的每份人家差不都在議論這兩家老闆到底在什麽地方傷了和氣。</p>
<p>有一天早上踏出弄口，光頭的烟兌店又上了墨黑的板門了，對街的大水板自然已收了進去，門前的水牌上恐怕也恢復了原來的價目了吧？</p>
<p>起初幾天我常常在弄口停下車子來援再到對街換角子，麻煩還在其次，看到他們店里的每張面孔，我馬上要想起那個搖着腦袋的光頭來，「死要面子活見鬼！」彷彿他用手掌從禿項上抹下來啐一口痰的憤怒的情狀在我眼前盪漾着</p>

<p>— 沈家千</p>
<p>昨天夜車抵×縣，落了客棧已經半夜二點鈸了。坐了一整天火車，背脊，腰肢都發酸了，見了床馬上想倒下去鬆散鬆散，受了一天徒刑的四肢；但是一問這裏的茶房，頭班汽油輪五點鐘就要開的，客棧離碼頭又要半點鐘的路程，掄着指頭一算，除頭去尾巴至多祗有二點鐘好睡，大家一商議，預備犧牲到底，要睡到輪船上睡，二點鐘坐着過去是很容易的。我們將這個意思告訴了茶房，要他替我們設法弄一些酒和菜，本來到這個時候也應該裝一點食物到肚子里去，我們的晚餐是在上車之前吃過一盆像裝飾品一樣的蛋炒飯。</p>
<p>但是那個瘦小的茶房頗有點投合外省客人的經騐，他說小地方小勢半夜里實在沒有買東西的店了，客棧里又不賣酒菜的；他說先生們要是高興，他可以帶我們到一個地方去，說了他故意把頭一縮，舌尖一伸，那種鬼鬼祟崇的樣子會使人想起戲臺上抹白鼻子的小丑。</p>
<p>那倒底是個什麽好地方，自然用不到他再詳加說明，大家都已經意悟的了。於是三個人又開了一次會議，到這種小市城來調查（這兩個字或許太官派一點，可是我們確有這種意思。）一下那些被生活榨壓着的可憐蟲底情况，未見得是十分無聊的行爲。我們卽刻答應了茶房，同時，我們不預備再回客棧來了，把行李交託了他，要他在五點之前送到碼頭，重重有賞。</p>
<p>那茶房高興極了，用重濁的鼻音回答了一連串的「是！是！是！」他也特地回到小房間去罩了件長衫，點了馬燈，偷偷地和睡在櫃台上的一個小伙計說通了，帶着我們上街。</p>
<p>街上像死去着一樣，犬吠的聲音也沒有，幾盞煤油的街燈距離總在四五丈遠以上，我們注意着馬燈所照到的一圈燈光，走路幾乎像在測量地形了。</p>
<p>將要折入一條小巷的時候，遇見一個值夜的警察，茶房就用一種我們所聽不懂的「切口」和他嘰哩咕嚕了一陣，把我們放行了。</p>
<p>那條小巷不是我故意說破話，如果比較寬一點的個子，他的兩個肩膀多少要受一點損失的。茶房告訴我們它呌小街，是娼妓的小本營。這裏的娼妓照每個月要捐上幾塊錢的花捐的說法應該是公約，但是被值夜的警察查出有留客宿夜的却要請你到裏面去坐一夜，雖然第二天至少要你化一點「出門費，」但是「生意」愈來愈壞了。我們碰到的那個警察故意「值」在小街的角上，就是這個意思。</p>
<p>走過十來間破房子，那茶房停在一家有一盞十二號媒油燈的門前了。門虛掩着，我們跟在他的後面走進去，經過一個臭氣撲鼻的天井，或許裏面已經聽到了我們的脚步聲，一個年輕的姑娘迎了出來，她先和茶房搭了嘴，才請我們到裏面坐。那茶房向我們要了二塊錢，他說明要和那個值夜的警察對拆的。</p>
<p>那房間可以用亂七八糟四個字來包括它，除了我們這筆「外快」之外，我想到這裏來的客人如果不專來宿夜的，那一定這市城裏太沒脊化錢的地方了。那小姑娘或許見我們是外省客人，忙着冲茶，又忙着裝兩碟瓜子花生出來，又高聲呌她的媽，說到外面去守着，有值夜的來，何二（那茶房的名字）已經打過一招呼了。</p>
<p>何二臨走的時候，也特地向我耳語：「什麽事有我何二保險，隨先生們高興吧。」又頭一縮，舌尖一伸，提着馬燈走了。（未完）</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe visited Foreign Minister Zhang at the Foreign Ministry's official residence at 3:00 PM on the 21st to continue the talks from the 19th regarding the adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations. This was the fifth exchange of opinions, and he departed at 5:20 PM. It is understood that the opinions of both sides still failed to align, and another meeting will be scheduled. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) It is reported that in the fifth meeting between Foreign Minister Zhang and Ambassador Kawagoe on the 21st, there was still a gap in their opinions.

(21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to observations here, the fifth meeting between Foreign Minister Zhang and Ambassador Kawagoe this afternoon seems to be blocked by various difficulties regarding the negotiations on the two major issues of special status for North China and joint anti-communism. This morning, Nanjing newspapers unanimously expressed their opposition to the anti-communist agreement, the Sino-Japanese North China navigation agreement, etc. Tokyo is paying serious attention to this. The general opinion is that the meeting between Foreign Minister Zhang and Ambassador Kawagoe today is the most urgent stage of the current negotiations. Whether the fate of the negotiations will be compromise, breakdown, or stagnation will be decided in a few hours. The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today still refused to release the content of the Sino-Japanese North China navigation agreement signed by Song Zheyuan and Horiuchi, the Japanese Consul-General in Tianjin, stating that they have not yet received a formal report.

<p>(Nanjing) After arriving in Nanjing from Hangzhou a few days ago, Han Fuqu has successively visited various central authorities in Nanjing for discussions. All sectors in Nanjing feel that Mr. Han is working hard on Shandong's affairs and is very busy, so there are few opportunities to come to Nanjing. Many have hosted banquets to entertain him. Mr. Han, considering that provincial affairs are waiting to be handled, especially visited President Chiang at noon on the 21st to request instructions on everything and will return to Jinan within a few days. When reporters visited him on the morning of the 21st to inquire about diplomatic and other issues, he said that the central government has its own comprehensive and meticulous plan for diplomatic and other issues, and Shandong Province has no other opinions. Shandong Province is the arm of the central government, and all diplomatic issues will be handled according to the directives of the central government. With the national crisis so severe, local officials should only be sincere and loyal, diligently perform their duties, and show unity towards the central government. If there are any external forces that damage the territory or endanger sovereignty, I will fulfill my responsibilities as a local official and strive to defend it. Even if there are difficulties, I am willing to persevere. During my visit to the south, I witnessed the people everywhere being vigorous, united from top to bottom, and a new atmosphere of unity. This has given me great excitement and demonstrates the enthusiasm of the people of the whole country to support unity and the government's determination to seek unity and engage in various construction projects to revive the nation. The opportunity for recovery from the extreme adversity has already begun, which makes people feel infinitely happy. Mr. Han then talked about Shandong Province's current active development of mass education and engagement in various important construction projects. Regarding the financial situation, it is not very tight. Fortunately, the Yellow River has been safely managed this year, and all construction can proceed without hindrance. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Shandong Chairman Han Fuqu will stay in Nanjing for another day or two. After visiting President Chiang again for instructions, he will return to Jinan. Han said that Shandong's construction, within the limits of the province's financial resources, has been steadily progressing on roads, telephones, canals, and Yellow River water conservancy, or has already established a foundation. For example, for telephones, all towns and villages can now be connected. After the Jinan-Liaocheng branch line was repurchased, Director Ge Guangting is planning to connect it to the Longhai Railway. Shandong's finances suffered more losses last year due to the Yellow River floods, with more expenses for protection and relief, about one million, one hundred thousand or so. This year, government spending has been tightened to gradually make up for it. The banditry in Shandong Province has been suppressed and cleared, and merchants, travelers, and farmers can all live and work in peace and contentment. Qingdao is also currently as normal. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A reporter from a certain news agency asked Han Fuqu, "Qingdao is located on the coast, a trading port. At this time of tense Sino-Japanese relations, what special circumstances are there in Shandong?" Han replied cautiously, "I cannot say what will happen in the future. There is certainly nothing happening now. The various rumors are not credible. The Japanese side has not raised any issues with Shandong." (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ding Weifen, Yu Hongqi, Yu Enbo, Gao Bingfang, Cui Weiwu, Wang Zizhuang, and other representatives, sixty-odd people, of the Shandong natives association in Nanjing, originally scheduled a banquet to honor Han Fuqu on the evening of the 20th at Minghu Chun, which was temporarily changed to 11:00 AM on the 21st due to circumstances. During the banquet, Ding delivered a speech on behalf of the association, praising Han's suppression of banditry and his constant adherence to the central government's leadership in dealing with the national crisis. Han replied that everything was done based on the four characters "protecting the country and defending the people" and hoped that his fellow countrymen would provide guidance on the politics of his hometown. Then, a group photo was taken, and the event ended happily. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Zhangjiakou) Wang Ying, commander of the puppet Anti-Communist Autonomous Army, has recently been suspected by a certain party, and his 4,000 infantry soldiers have been suddenly dismissed. Currently, Wang only has 1,500 cavalry, and there is talk of transferring him to Dolon. Jin Jiasan, a bandit army from Rehe, will take over Shangdu. Li Shouxin, the puppet army commander, is highly trusted by a certain party, and most of his troops have been deployed from Zhangbei to the Daqinggou area to monitor Wang's troops. The puppet army's plans to invade Sui have therefore been delayed. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Mongolian Committee received two telegrams from the Zhangjiakou office and the Gabsi Temple De Wangfu, reporting that the bandit puppet army in eastern Sui is still confronting the national army. Although the situation is severe, it is unlikely to escalate in the short term because Wang Ying's bandit troops are short of people and weapons and are constantly recruiting. The Mongolians are deeply aware of the greater good and are unwilling to join the rebellion. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Zhangyuan reports that more than 2,000 soldiers of the puppet army of Li Shouxin, and 3,500 soldiers of the 4th brigade of Rehe puppet army of Wu Jiatin, have been concentrated in Shangdu by the 17th of this month, and have established contact with Wang Ying's bandit troops stationed in Daxingzhuang and Erdaohexi south of Shangdu-Jining border, adopting an encirclement posture against Sui East. It is expected that they will invade Sui in two routes within this ten days. One route will be led by Bao Yueqing, along the Pangjiang Pangji Road, and the other route will be led by Li Shouxin, departing from Daxingzhuang. The target is Pingdiquan. At the same time, Wang Ying's bandits will harass Xinghe as a diversion. (21st China United News Agency)</p>

Regarding Sino-Japanese navigation, the content of the Huitong Company is to formulate methods by both shareholders in accordance with our country's ordinary company law, which must be decided and reported when the inaugural meeting or shareholders' meeting is held.

<p>(Nanjing) The Judicial Yuan interprets the disputes in appeal cases. The decision of the appeal has the effect of binding the original disposition or the original decision-making agency. Article 12 of the Appeal Law has clear provisions. Except for the original disposition or the original decision that is not accepted, the person who is not accepted can file another appeal or an administrative lawsuit. The original disposition or the original decision is finalized, and the agency of the original disposition or the original decision must be bound and must not automatically revoke its original decision by the original decision-making agency. As for the referral to a higher-level agency, except in accordance with the law, it must not use its supervisory authority to order the original decision-making agency to make a further decision. The agency that accepts the re-appeal must not automatically revoke the re-appeal that has been decided and make another decision. However, appeals and re-appeals are both the rights or interests of the people. If the rights or interests of the people are damaged due to the decisions or improper dispositions of the official agencies, and the appeal agency finds errors after the decision of the appeal or re-appeal is finalized, or revokes the original disposition due to other circumstances and makes a new disposition, if the rights or interests of the appellant or the re-appellant are not damaged as a result, they can make other dispositions based on their administrative rights or supervisory authority, and are not within the scope of the provisions that should be bound.

<p>A Sideways Discussion on Sino-Japanese Diplomacy</p>
<p>Regarding the above, I cannot list every detail of this Sino-Japanese diplomatic adjustment case, as I do not have thorough knowledge. However, the general points are those that have been publicized by Chinese and foreign newspapers. The content and the limits of responsive strategies are roughly not far off. Readers can study this information and make their own judgment. As for how we should respond, I will try to relate what I have heard, but I cannot guarantee that it is the truth.</p>
<p>When these items reached our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the ministry, under the direction of higher authorities, could not but seek instructions. From the very beginning of the proposal, Tokyo simultaneously declared that our country could no longer waver at the crossroads and must come to a decision. However, in the eyes of reporters who like to find proof, Japan's words are reminiscent of our country's declaration last year. Did our country not declare that it would never abandon peace when peace was not completely hopeless, and would not lightly talk about sacrifice until the final moment? If this is true, then the so-called crossroads were not something that Japan mentioned today, but something that our country had already imagined in its mind. Since our country had already imagined this, it used this outline as the goal for peace, sacrifice, and the direction to take. Under this principle, the parties concerned responded to external forces with a firm will, and planned a strategy of negotiation with a spirit of preparedness. The so-called countermeasures are the origin of the five points that have been circulated.</p>
<p>Diplomatic maneuvering has no fixed formula, and various attitudes are used to exhaust the ability to maneuver. This is what is commonly seen in the diplomatic world. During stage A, they had oral proposals, and we also had oral counter-proposals. Those who are arrogant will naturally like to use subjective attitudes, and as a result, the negotiations in stage A came to a halt. The reason for the halt was not that our subjectivity was excessive and we did not want to thoroughly analyze the advantages and disadvantages between urgency and priority, but that our countermeasures were not valued by the other party. Between countries, in addition to equal diplomacy, anything that harms the other party's sovereignty should not be mentioned. Now, going a step further, our proposal to protect our own sovereignty is still not valued by the other party. Then what else can be said to continue the process? Those responsible to higher authorities and those responsible for negotiations have the same feeling. Therefore, stage A was terminated under these circumstances.</p>
<p>After the suspension, the situation on the other side showed signs of being outwardly tense and inwardly relaxed. Why do I say outwardly tense? The Japanese military mobilized troops by land and sea, creating a tense atmosphere. On the one hand, they aided the bandit army of Wang Ying in Chahar, and on the other hand, they created an extremely urgent appearance in Shanghai. The situation has become untenable. Needless to say, this is to start high pressure with a tense situation, hoping that we will submit. As for the inward relaxation, there are also people in their country who know themselves and know their enemy. They know that the way of high pressure is not easy to deal with those who are prepared. Moreover, the degree of urgency on the surface is far from the actual fighting. If safety is not planned, it will easily turn into a rash debt. They have already exhausted their tricks of accusing us of wavering at the crossroads, and they have actually placed themselves at a crossroads. In addition, those who are responsible for negotiating with us have been in China for more than 20 years and have a clearer understanding of our current response. Therefore, they are still cautious, only seeking to proceed step by step, and do not need to fall into excessive difficulties to seek the illusion of implementing everything. Under these circumstances of outward tension and inward relaxation, although the negotiations in stage A have stopped, side activities against us have also begun immediately. As for these side activities, let's divide them into methods and strategies.</p>
<p>Since the negotiations between the Japanese ambassador and our Ministry of Foreign Affairs have stopped in stage A and are difficult to continue, we must find another method to open the door for continuation. This method is that the Japanese side requests to contact the head of the administrative Yuan, the higher-level agency of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In terms of international practice, this is not appropriate, but since the negotiations of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have been suspended, it is not easy to seek other ways. However, the views of the civil and military officials in Tokyo are different. When the military is preparing for war and the civil officials are pulling back, they have to come up with a plan to open the way for continued progress and to quell the internal激angry mouths. Therefore, the argument for requesting the higher-level agency of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to be the negotiating partner is very popular. This is the method of side activities, which is used internally to resolve the crisis and externally to help the poor in stage A. As for its strategy, they also know that it is against the norm to ask for a counterpart other than the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It must not be achieved easily. Therefore, the activities extend to other departments besides the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, with individuals as the center and with the means of meetings. In the opening remarks, the truth is mixed with falsehood, and in this endless situation, there is only this method to make a difference. Our country still adheres to last year's declaration, believing that since peace has not been despaired of, there is no need to lightly abandon peace. However, the specific conditions and even the negotiations are not possible with other parties besides the responsible Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and it is even more impossible to take the simple people of the higher-level agencies as opponents. After some twists and turns, the opinions are closer, and at this time, President Chiang of the Executive Yuan also happened to arrive in Jiangxi from Guangdong, and there was a need to measure political affairs in Nanjing. If this matter is resumed after interruption, if the meeting is used as an opportunity, as long as it does not violate the normal practice of negotiations and does not appoint a negotiating opponent, then why be stingy with a meeting. Therefore, after President Chiang arrived in Nanjing, there was a visit by Kawagoe on the morning of the 8th. This was gradually entering the B-level stage due to side activities.</p>
<p>The two-hour meeting on the 8th was a private conversation, which outsiders could not know. Even if they knew it, there would be no need to describe it in detail. To guess the general outline, what he earnestly discussed was to state all the items he hoped for one by one, and add reasons to justify the extreme reasonableness of his hopes. We did not say much besides broadly discussing the overall situation and the relations between the two countries, only saying that everything should still be done by those responsible for the negotiations. In fact, as a result of the prior side contact, since there is no need to recognize individuals other than the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as the object of consultation, then in addition to stating various items during the meeting, it is only necessary to also consider how the future will be and the pros and cons of the event. There was never a request for an individual to make any specific answer. This kind of meeting can only be said to be an empty talk of personal opinions, and cannot be said to be a concrete negotiation. The other party has also made thorough calculations for us. At this time, since we are talking about negotiations, we must find an opponent, and at this time, there is no way to seek an opponent other than the responsible opponent. Therefore, after a meeting, even if we think back afterwards, we feel that what we said to each other was only in general terms, which seems to be boundless. However, we can only believe that it is the opponent's capital to observe the traces of its deduction.</p>
<p>After this stage B has been launched, we can move from a deadlock to a path where we can talk to each other. Therefore, there are reports that there will be another meeting with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on a certain day. In fact, although it is currently in stage B, it has not yet reached the time of stage B, but it is only the work of consultation. Consultation is mostly close to business, and it has not reached a certain concrete point. Then it is enough to have the business officials run around and explain. There is no need to immediately go through a formal negotiation. The contact between the business officials is simpler, the speech is more free, and the exploration is more practical. If all items are under the principle of not violating the founding principles, and we are fortunate to find a way, then what can be done, what cannot be done, what should have the establishment of a specialized research institution, and what should be handled automatically by the authorities. Separately plan and prepare, or even take advantage of this stage B to seek a temporary end to this negotiation. If the fundamentals are still subjective and opinions have not become closer, then from B to C to D, how will we get a way later? At this time, it is not easy to predict.</p>

<h3 id="e49">Unexpected Visit by the Minister of Foreign Affairs to Germany <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>— Lang</p>
<p>The recent developments in the European situation have reached an extremely important juncture. The successive victories of the Spanish rebels and Belgium's official proclamation of neutrality all indicate the significant growth of the fascist bloc's power, dealing a great blow to the international peace front. But the most important aspect is the further consolidation of the two fascist nations, Italy and Germany.</p>
<p>According to foreign dispatches, the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Count Ciano, Mussolini's son-in-law, arrived in Berlin on the 20th to visit the German Foreign Minister Neurath and important figures of the National Socialist Party. After staying in Berlin for two days, he will proceed to Berchtesgaden to meet with Führer Hitler. According to general observations, the content of the talks will inevitably involve recent important European issues such as the recognition of the Spanish rebel government, the Belgian neutrality issue, the Mediterranean and Central European issues, and the anti-Soviet Union issue. Although we cannot predict the outcome of the talks now, based on the two countries' shared fascist ideology and recent close relationship, the result of this meeting will undoubtedly strengthen the unity of the fascist bloc and further intensify its threat to world peace.</p>
<p>The formation of a common front between Germany and Italy began during the East African War. Before this time, although Italy and Germany were both fascist comrades, their conflicting interests in Central Europe formed a hostile situation. However, since the outbreak of the East African War, this situation has completely changed because Italy's aggressive behavior has aroused serious international repercussions, and its conflict with British interests in the Mediterranean is particularly serious. Therefore, Italy had to change its policy towards Germany, easing the contradictions between them and joining hands to strengthen its resistance against Britain. At the same time, since Germany abandoned the Treaty of Versailles and the Locarno Pact, actively expanded its military, and launched an anti-Soviet crusade, its international position has also become very isolated. It needs the cooperation of fascist comrades. Under such circumstances, the combination of Germany and Italy began to develop. Recently, due to the rise of the People's Front and the growth of peace forces, the unity of this aggressive bloc has further developed.</p>
<p>We can cite many important facts to prove the collusion between Germany and Italy. When the League of Nations imposed sanctions on Italy, Germany helped Italy along with Austria-Hungary and other countries. In early summer this year, Italian Undersecretary of Aviation General Valle also visited Berlin and signed the German-Italian aviation agreement. A few days ago, German Undersecretary of Aviation General Milch also paid a return visit to Rome. In July, Germany and Italy established an important political agreement. At the same time, the German-Austrian reconciliation agreement was also announced under Mussolini's suggestion, sweeping away the German-Austrian disputes of the past few years. Most recently, the pro-German Foreign Minister Ciano again visited Berlin to meet with the leaders of the National Socialist Party. The significance of this is of course imaginable.</p>
<p>The two fascist countries, Germany and Italy, not only want to ease their internal contradictions and establish close relations, but also want to win over countries with fascist tendencies to form a fascist group to fight against international peace forces and the democratic front. An important issue in this German-Italian meeting is how to reconcile their internal contradictions and form a more consolidated aggressive front. According to the most worrying situation, Ciano's trip may produce significant political consequences and pose a more serious threat to the international peace front. However, at the same time, we must also recognize that the internal contradictions of the fascist bloc will inevitably erupt sooner or later. How to promote its eruption depends on the efforts of peace-loving people all over the world.</p>

<p>(Rome) Italian troops have entered the fertile region of Sidamo in western Abyssinia, the result of the great battle to capture Chiava-Sirl. The battle lasted for six hours. The Italian army first bombarded the Abyssinian positions with heavy artillery, followed by infantry charges. Hundreds of Abyssinians were killed, and the rest fled into mountain caves. The Abyssinian army, commanded by General Abebe, launched a fierce counterattack, but was defeated by Italian aircraft with bombs. The Italian infantry continued to attack, and the Abyssinian army fled in panic. General Abebe was also among those killed in action. The Italian army captured many machine guns. (Reuter, 20th)</p>

<p>(Berlin) Italian Foreign Minister Ciano met with German Foreign Minister Neurath for 90 minutes this morning, reportedly discussing European issues. The two sides' views were very harmonious. Ciano later expressed his satisfaction with the outcome of the talks to guests. Further talks are expected this afternoon or tomorrow. (Reuter, 21st)</p>
<p>(Berlin) After arriving here, Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano began talks with German Foreign Minister Neurath at the Foreign Ministry at 11:00 a.m. today. After the talks, he attended a luncheon at the Italian Embassy. There were no German officials present. The German authorities are scheduled to hold a grand welcome reception this afternoon at the sports stadium, presided over by National Socialist Youth Leader Schirach. Foreign Minister Neurath will host a banquet in the Foreign Ministry auditorium this evening. In addition to important figures from the financial, industrial, and artistic circles, Führer Hitler will send Minister Without Portfolio Hess to represent him. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Although semi-official sources say that it is too early to predict the content of future agreements between Italy and Germany, it is generally believed that the two countries will jointly resist Bolshevism in Spain. Political circles say that Germany and Italy have expressed opposition to various regional agreements. However, the future Locarno Pact will be treated differently if it does not attract other countries (referring to the Soviet Union) to join. It is also said that Article 16 of the League of Nations (i.e., the sanctions measures) is also one of the main goals of the talks between the German and Italian foreign authorities. Regarding the Austrian issue, Ciano will meet with Führer Hitler in Berchtesgaden. Regarding economic and financial issues, he will meet with Aviation Minister General Göring, the newly appointed "Four-Year Plan Dictator." (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Italian Foreign Minister Ciano began talks with German Foreign Minister Neurath today, and the results have attracted much attention from various countries. According to an Italian official spokesman, Germany will first recognize Italy's annexation of Abyssinia, and Italy will cede certain economic rights in Abyssinia to Germany in exchange. (National Telegraph, 21st)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano arrived here at 8:00 p.m. The Italian Ambassador to Germany, Attolico, went to the station to meet him and arrived in Beijing in the same car as Ciano. In addition to Führer Hitler's representative, Foreign Minister Neurath, those welcoming him at the station included a majority of people from Italy and Germany, and the atmosphere was very warm. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>Italian Newspaper Reveals: Goals of the Talks</p>
<p>(Rome) Various newspapers have commented on the talks that Italy and Germany should conduct, and their opinions do not go beyond the following: (1) At this time of European turmoil, Italy and Germany both want to work actively to find a way to achieve peace, but this peace cannot be based on maintaining the status quo. (2) Italy and Germany have already submitted replies to the note proposed by Britain regarding the convocation of the Locarno Conference, with reservations attached, because the two countries believe that the future Locarno Pact can be linked to the League of Nations, but it cannot be related to the Franco-Russian mutual assistance pact. (3) Before the future Locarno Pact is signed, certain issues must be resolved first, especially Italy must first obtain guarantees that it will have freedom of navigation in the Mediterranean without restrictions. (4) The outcome of the German-Italian talks should determine the positions that the two countries occupy in Central Europe. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>German Newspaper's Comment: Worth Pondering</p>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano's visit to Berlin, Italian newspapers had been promoting it extensively for several days, while German newspapers waited until yesterday, the day Ciano arrived in Berlin, to comment on it. The difference in attitude is noteworthy. Therefore, the claim from foreign sources that the two sides have reached an agreement on several issues cannot be easily believed. Regarding this, German people are mostly reserved, believing that the talks that Ciano and the German Foreign Minister should conduct are only for exchanging opinions. Outside speculation should be treated with caution. It is also said that Italy's tendency towards Germany is due to the fact that European countries have a negative impression of Italy and Germany, and are unwilling to recognize their rights related to survival. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>Vigorously Promoting: Joint Anti-Russian Sentiment</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Essen National Daily (the organ of Prussian Governor Göring) recently commented on Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano's visit to Germany, saying, "Italy and Germany now take the same attitude towards the common enemy of the world, namely Bolshevism. At this time, European peace is being constantly threatened by revolutionary slogans and the Red Army representing Bolshevism. The common views of Italy and Germany are the most reliable guarantee of European peace." The newspaper also published a message from a Rome correspondent stating that Ciano brought several concrete proposals for discussion with the German authorities. If Italy and Germany can reach an agreement, several outstanding issues in the European situation may be resolved. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<h3 id="e54">Italy's Reply to Britain: Friendly Tone; Explains Technical Viewpoint on the Locarno Conference Issue <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>(London) The British government recently proposed a suggestion regarding a future conference of the five Locarno Pact countries. It has now received a reply from the Italian government, which is worded quite friendly, but only states preliminary opinions that are not of a far-reaching nature. Diplomatic circles believe that this must be because Italy and Germany are discussing similar policies. The article does not mention the political differences between Italy and Britain regarding the Mediterranean. (Reuter, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the issue of convening the Locarno Conference, the Italian government submitted a reply yesterday to the note that the British government sent to France, Italy, and Germany on the 18th of last month. According to responsible sources, the wording of this reply is quite friendly. Regarding the Locarno issue itself, it only provides explanations from a "technical" point of view, in other words, it does not mention the interconnection between the Locarno issue and the Eastern European mutual assistance pact. In addition, the reply also advocates that the countries signing the future Locarno Pact should enjoy reciprocal rights under any circumstances, meaning that the security of Italy should also be guaranteed by each signatory. Only with full reciprocal rights can perfect balance be achieved. In addition, the signatories should be divided into two categories: guarantor countries and guaranteed countries, and each guarantor country and guaranteed country can form a group within the scope of the new Locarno Pact, such as the Anglo-French pact and the Anglo-Italian pact. According to this opinion, British semi-official circles have always opposed the proposal to guarantee Italy, believing that if this is the case, it will cause several complicated problems, such as the current situation in the Mediterranean. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>Beijing: Regarding the issue of convening the Locarno Conference, after the British government sent notes to France, Italy, and Germany on the 18th of last month, France, Germany, and Italy have already submitted replies. It is learned that Belgium's reply will also be delivered to the British government on Wednesday or Friday of this week. The reply also intends to explain King Leopold III's recent declaration of neutrality and the new diplomatic policy adopted by Belgium. (Havas, 20th)</p>

<p>Romanian Capital: After King Carol of Romania visits Prague at the end of this month, Czechoslovakia will gain a kind of security guarantee, so that it will not be attacked suddenly by other countries. It is reported that Romania, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia have agreed to build a bridge of military importance in Dunavăţu de Jos, Romania, crossing the Danube River, connecting the transportation of Yugoslavia and Romania, and building a railroad through northern Romania to the Czech border, so that when Czechoslovakia encounters a sudden attack by other countries, the troops and supplies of Romania and Yugoslavia can be transported at any time along this route to support Czechoslovakia. It is believed that the saying that this railway line extends to the Soviet border is unlikely to become a reality, because Yugoslavia has always opposed the Little Entente countries concluding a military alliance with the Soviet Union. (Reuter, 21st)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, the newspapers here carried news from the Romanian capital, saying that Romanian Prime Minister Tătărescu had gone to Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia, on a secret mission. The newspapers are all afraid that the increasingly close relationship between Russia and France may cause France to lose its two alliance countries, namely Romania and Yugoslavia. Belgium's recent return to a neutral policy and alienation from France is also due to this. Well-informed circles in the Romanian capital all believe that Romania and South Korea will enter into an agreement to deal with the Soviet Union with a more cautious policy. (Reuter, 21st)</p>
<p>Capital of Yugoslavia: Romanian Prime Minister Tătărescu arrived here this morning by special ship via the Danube River. Although officials say that this trip is purely private, Tătărescu met with South Korean Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Stojadinović immediately after landing. Some observers believe that Romania and South Korea recently concluded an agreement that stipulates measures for financial and economic cooperation, among which the two measures of Romania's supply of coal oil to South Korea and the construction of bridges on the Danube River are more important.

<p>(Berlin) General Göring issued a statement stating that Führer Hitler's National Socialist Party Advisor Keppler has been dismissed and is awaiting assignment. According to Keppler, who belongs to the radical faction of the National Socialist Party who advocate national socialist policies, the public regards Keppler's loss of power as a sign of the increasing capitalization of German economic policy, and thus Economic Minister Schacht has regained a victory. (Reuter, 21st)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Since Göring was given full power to implement the four-year plan and handle all economic issues, Premier Hitler has withdrawn the privileges given to Keppler regarding raw materials. When notifying Keppler, Premier Hitler expressed his gratitude for his success in handling raw materials. It is reported that Keppler will have an important appointment under Göring, the official in charge of promoting the four-year plan. (National Telegraph, 20th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Führer Hitler announced at the National Socialist Party Congress last month that Germany would implement a four-year construction plan. Yesterday, he gave full power to implement the plan to Aviation Minister General Göring, appointing him as the "Four-Year Plan Dictator." The detailed program of this plan will be announced soon, and General Göring will also issue several orders at the same time to implement the plan. German people have been commenting on Göring's new position, and the newspapers have mostly spoken of the general mobilization of the entire national power, hoping that Göring will maintain price levels and deal with unscrupulous merchants with resolute means. Among them, the Berlin Daily reported, "The task undertaken by General Göring has an all-encompassing nature." Other newspapers said that the press is also under Göring's jurisdiction, and the implication seems to be to break away from the shackles of Propaganda Minister Goebbels and express a certain degree of satisfaction. In any case, Göring's position now exceeds Goebbels, which is a fact. (Havas, 20th)</p>

<p>(Vienna) Chinese Minister to Poland Zhang Xin-hai recently gave a lecture at the Cultural Association here, entitled "Intellectual Perspectives on New China." The content first compared the European countries' emphasis on materialism with the Asian civilization's emphasis on intellectual characteristics, and elaborated on the efforts of Chinese Executive Yuan President Chiang Kai-shek to promote old morals and strengthen the authority of the central government, saying that the cause of China's unification has now been completed thanks to the efforts of General Chiang Kai-shek, and the future task is only to make it more solid. He also said that although China's progress in science is slow, it does not seek to advance rashly, and its wisdom lies in this. Its curiosity about novel things in science and politics is not as great as that of Europe, but it strives to promote social harmony. Zhang's speech was full of highlights, and the audience, all well-known Austrian figures, applauded and praised it. (Unique Sickness Telegraph, 20th)</p>

<p>Madrid – General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the Spanish rebel army, is pressing his attack on Madrid ever more urgently. A large number of fresh troops are arriving continuously to join the front lines in order to participate in the final battle to capture the capital. It is also reported that the situation there is becoming increasingly difficult. For example, the climate is gradually becoming colder, and Madrid's coal reserves are almost exhausted. Rebel forces claim they have reached a location less than twenty miles from the capital and are currently consolidating their positions. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>Madrid – The capital's situation is tense today. Residents are aware that the rebel army is almost at the city walls. Newspapers are encouraging all citizens to fight hard to defend the city. Soldiers are also posting and distributing leaflets everywhere, vowing to fight to the death. The Foreign Minister, Val, has ordered all citizens to arm themselves and defend the city. The General Labor Union has convened workers in its branches to prepare for a general mobilization. The central station is crowded today with people wanting to leave the city. Socialist and anarchist unions have ordered all dance halls and bars employing women to close. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>Madrid – Special dispatch from our correspondent: Although the capital's position is precarious due to the approach of the Nationalist army, public morale has not been dampened. The fervent enthusiasm from the beginning of the civil war seems to have been rekindled. Even women are displaying extraordinary vigor, not letting men have all the glory. These women are gathering in groups of three to five, rushing through the streets, shouting slogans to boost morale, saying, "Men should fight at the front, women should serve at the rear." Whenever the people's militia takes an offensive posture at the front, people from all walks of life cheer and rejoice, feeling inexplicable comfort. Newspapers unanimously advocate that the best way to defend is to attack, and simply defending is futile. Such arguments are seen daily. Government troops launched counterattacks against the Nationalist army in several locations today. The fighting was fierce from Navalcarnero to Brunete, west of the capital. At the same time, government aircraft bombed and bombarded rebel positions. As a result, government troops have retaken the positions around Illescas, south of the capital, which were lost in recent days. In addition, the ambulance teams of the British Red Cross are providing very effective service on the battlefield. Team members often enter and exit the hail of bullets, risking danger to carry wounded soldiers back for treatment. Their bravery is truly admirable. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>Lisbon – According to a rebel radio broadcast today, the Madrid government has established two lines of defense: the first is in the suburbs of Madrid, equipped with 1,000 machine guns, and the second is inside the city.

<p>Burgos – General Franco, commander-in-chief of the rebel army, told a guest today that negotiations with Madrid today would not succeed because we insist on unconditional surrender. The general seemed very confident about the war, continuing that the Nationalist army's victory is imminent. Our army has now occupied the town of Illescas, 25 miles from the capital, and has surrounded the town of Navalcarnero. Our army is now threatening the town of Aranjuez and controls the town of El Escorial. The battle lines around the capital have been surveyed and defensive works have been established. Our army has advanced one hundred kilometers in a few weeks. Our army could have advanced deeper and faster, but we do not want to bombard villages and towns where those who sympathize with us live. Finally, the general denied rumors that the Nationalist army was using poison gas in combat. (Reuters, 21st)</p>

(Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Although people generally feel that the Soviet Union is unlikely to decide to withdraw from the non-intervention agreement before the next meeting of the Non-Intervention Committee in the Spanish Civil War, political circles in Moscow are pessimistic about whether the committee can satisfy the Soviet Union's demands, and anticipate that the Soviet representative will withdraw early and then supply the troops of the Madrid government with military arms. At the same time, tens of thousands of workers, encouraged by officials, have held many meetings, shouting slogans such as "If fascist intervention does not stop, we should quickly transport military arms to aid Spain." The labor unions have recently collected donations amounting to millions of rubles to purchase food and clothing to help Spanish civilians. Foreign observers believe that the Soviet Union is unlikely to deploy troops or transport military arms to Spain for the time being, fearing that it would trigger an international catastrophe. However, once the non-intervention agreement is scrapped, it seems likely that it will purchase military arms in other countries and transport them to Spain from there. (Reuters, 21st)</p>

<p>Brussels – Two hundred thousand members of the fascist Rexist Party are scheduled to march and demonstrate on Sunday. It is reported that 100,000 members of the Socialist Party are also scheduled to hold a meeting on the same day. Socialist figures have also stated that their party's decision to hold the meeting on this day was made first, which is known to everyone. Therefore, the demonstration planned by the Rexist Party is a provocative act. As for whether the government should prohibit the demonstration planned by the Rexist Party, a special committee of the Cabinet is scheduled to hold an emergency meeting at 3:00 PM today to discuss it, and a decision will be made at that time. The dispute between the government and the Rexist Party (which has Flemish nationalism supporting it) is about to enter a new stage, which is being closely watched by the people of the whole country. Observers believe that the government knows that the Rexist Party should be stopped immediately, but it is still hesitant about what method to use. In addition, members of the majority party in the House of Representatives, such as the Flemish Nationalist Catholic Party, are now planning to join hands with the Flemish Nationalist Party, which makes the government feel even more difficult.

<p>Brussels – Baudart, a member of the Christian Democratic Party (also known as the Catholic Workers' Party, now affiliated with the Catholic Party) in the House of Representatives, recently gave a speech at a Christian workers' rally, stating briefly that the leader of the fascist Rexist Party, Degrelle, went to Germany on the 27th of last month to visit the authorities of the German Foreign Ministry, and completed an agreement with Flemish nationalism a few days before leaving for Germany, planning to divide the Wallonia region inhabited by the Walloon people in southeastern Belgium and the Flanders region inhabited by the Flemish people in the west into two administrative regions. According to the languages and characters used by the Belgian people, French and Flemish have been used simultaneously for a long time. Now the Rexist Party and the Flemish Nationalist Party want to adopt two languages in the Wallonia region, and Flemish as the official language in the Flanders region. After this plan was announced, the hearts of the Belgian people were greatly shaken, and party figures said that this was an act of destroying the unity of Belgium. The Minister of Transportation even declared that this movement wanted to make Belgium an ally of Germany and establish a fascist regime. (Havas News Agency, 21st)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Russian Ambassador to Japan, Yurenev, met with Foreign Minister Arita on the 16th. At that time, he presented six conditions regarding the establishment of a commission to determine the border and a commission to handle disputes, seeking Japan's opinion. Foreign Minister Arita invited the Russian Ambassador to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 4:30 PM on the 20th to formally respond to the proposal.</p>
<p>Russian Ambassador: After the establishment of the two commissions on the border between Russia and Manchuria in the east, all disputes that occur before the border is determined should be reviewed by the Dispute Resolution Committee.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister: Japan has no objections to this proposal.</p>
<p>Russian Ambassador: Outside the eastern border zone, a Dispute Resolution Committee should be established within two months to handle incidents occurring in that zone.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister: It is only meaningful to have two types of committees, so Japan opposes setting up only one Dispute Resolution Committee. As for limiting its term to two months, it is difficult for Japan to understand the true intention of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Russian Ambassador: The Dispute Resolution Committee established on the eastern border should handle all incidents that have occurred since January of this year.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister: Past incidents should be limited to incidents that occurred after its establishment.</p>
<p>Russian Ambassador: The "Manchu"-Mongolian Border Dispute Resolution Committee is currently in progress. If the committee cannot proceed smoothly, I hope the Japanese government will urge the "Manchu" government to promote negotiations.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister: Manchu-Mongolian negotiations have absolutely nothing to do with Japan. The Japanese government has no say in this.</p>
<p>Russian Ambassador: The fundamental spirit of establishing two types of committees lies in maintaining peace on the Russian-Manchu border. However, it is regrettable that various disputes have recently occurred.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister: The Japanese government also sincerely hopes for peace on the borders of the two countries. The reason for the recent incidents is the uncertainty of the border line. Therefore, the establishment of a border demarcation committee is urgently needed.</p>
<p>Russian Envoy: Regarding the composition of the two committees, the Soviet Union considers Japan and "Manchukuo" to be one entity.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister: When establishing this committee, Japan, "Manchukuo," and Russia each have their own independent positions, so Japan cannot agree to this proposal.</p>
<p>In Foreign Minister Arita's reply, the Russian Ambassador has recognized five of them, but because the sixth item is the most important condition for the Soviet government, it needs to request the opinion of its own government. After its instructions arrive, it will give a reply. The Russian Ambassador left at 7:30 PM. As a result of the talks on that day, both sides were almost in agreement on the fundamental spirit of establishing a committee. Only the sixth item has not been resolved. If this one item is resolved, then Tōgō, Director of the European and Asian Affairs Bureau, and Soviet Counselor Rapete will conduct practical negotiations. (Dōmei, 21st)</p>

<h3 id="e78">Fu Zuoyi Pays Attention to Ping-Sui Railway Traffic; Enemy Planes Fly to Sui East for Reconnaissance; De Wang Gives a Speech at Jiabu Temple Again <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Shangdu Correspondence: The bandit army Wang Ying, Li Shouxin, etc., entrenched in Chabei, have been making loud noises about invading the west recently, but they have not yet realized it. According to people who understand the inside story of the bandit army, the reason for the delay is that on the one hand, the defense of Sui Province Chairman Fu Zuoyi is strict, and on the other hand, the internal situation of the bandits is complicated, making it difficult to fight. However, judging from the current situation, the occurrence of war is probably unavoidable. At 7:00 a.m. on the 18th, three enemy planes circled over Shangdu. Judging from their direction, they flew from Dolun. They hovered in the air for a week, then flew southwest to the Sui East area for reconnaissance. After 8:00 a.m., the three planes flew back together. When passing over Shangdu, they did not circle and flew east towards Dolun.</p>
<p>Under the environment of enemy and puppet coveting and invading the Sui East area, Sui Province Chairman Fu Zuoyi, in addition to doing his best to consolidate the defense to prepare for emergencies, pays special attention to the traffic on the Ping-Sui Railway. It is said that Fu Zuoyi issued a notice to all counties along the Ping-Sui Railway a few days ago, roughly stating that the Ping-Sui Railway is a key transportation artery in the northwest, which is related to national defense. In order to prevent bandits from destroying the traffic, special regulations are made for the protection and inspection of bridges and culverts of all sizes within the territory of each county in the Sui Province along the Ping-Sui Railway, and the number of bridges and culverts in each county is detailed, listed and distributed to each county for strict compliance. The local authorities of each county are responsible for assigning security teams or township guides along the road to closely monitor day and night, prohibiting pedestrians from approaching or staying on the road, so as to prevent the bandits from taking the opportunity to destroy it. If the tracks and bridges are destroyed by bandits within the territory of the county after the issuance of this notice, only the county magistrate of the county will be held accountable.</p>
<p>According to people from Jiabu Temple, De Wang summoned a speech at Jiabu Temple the other day, but outsiders have no way of knowing the content. Also, the Mongolian Living Buddha Dongwu Jumuqin Buddha went to Zhangjiakou the other day and stayed there. It is said that he has decided to take the Ping-Sui express train to Ping on the evening of the 18th. After visiting the leaders of Pingfang, he will go south to Jinjing (October 18th).</p>
<h3 id="e79">Guangxi Army Demobilization Completed; Regular Army Still Organized into Two Armies and Six Divisions; Actively Training Militias During Agricultural Leisure <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Wuzhou Correspondence: Since the realization of peace in Guangxi Province, the army has been completely demobilized, and the people's troops have also returned to their hometowns to serve. The Headquarters of the Guangxi Army is now established in Guilin, but the military designation has not been changed. In addition to the headquarters in Guilin, a headquarters camp has also been established in Nanning. The organization of the headquarters is divided into two offices and twelve departments. The directors and chiefs of the departments have been appointed as follows: Director of the General Office Zheng Chengdian, Director of the Military Affairs Office Lv Jingcun, Chief of the Staff Office Li Xingzhu, Chief of the Military Affairs Office Ge Shixi, Chief of the Adjutant Office Tang Xipu, Chief of the Management Office Xie Zanying, Chief of the Medical Office Xie Sai, Chief of the Political Training Office Pan Yizhi, Chief of the Military Law Office Zhang Jundu, Chief of the Ordnance Office Chen Hanwu, Chief of the Transportation Office Lan Tengjiao, Chief of the Training Office Zhang Zhuangsheng, Chief of the Secretariat Zhu Foding, Chief of the Regiment Affairs Office Li Zuoli. The regular army of the province is organized into two armies and seven divisions, including the 7th Army, with Commander Liao Lei and Deputy Commander Zhou Zujian, under the jurisdiction of the 19th Division Xu Qiming, the 21st Division Yang Junchang, and the 24th Division Cheng Shufen, a total of three divisions; the 15th Army, with Commander Xia Wei and Deputy Commander Zhang Yunsong, under the jurisdiction of the 43rd Division He Weizhen, the 44th Division Wang Zanbin, and the 45th Division Mo Shujie, a total of three divisions, totaling two armies and six divisions. In addition, there is the newly編 First Division under the command of Weng Zhaoyuan.</p>
<p>After the demobilization of the militias and reserve units in Guangxi Province, the training is still being intensified. The militia command headquarters in each district remains the same, only the Yulin Militia Command District is added to command the militias in Yulin. The militia command headquarters is directly under the General Headquarters. There are currently nine militia districts, each with a militia commander and a deputy commander. Most of the militia commanders in each district still hold their posts. The names of the militia commanders in each district are as follows: Nanning District Liang Hansong, Guilin District Chen En Yuan, Wuzhou District Huang Heling, Xunzhou District Chen Liangzuo, Liuzhou District Huang Mian, Pingle District Zhong Zupei, Baise District Su Xinmin, Tianbao District Gao Yangru, Longzhou District Jiang Ruquan. All of the above are major general or lieutenant general ranks. The militia commanders are under the command of the General Headquarters and the supervision of the Provincial Government. Each militia district governs ten or more counties. Each county has a militia command headquarters, with a militia commander concurrently held by the county magistrate and deputy county magistrate. Below the county is a district, with a district joint team headquarters, with a joint team captain concurrently held by the township/district chief. Below the district is a township (town), with a brigade headquarters, with a brigade commander concurrently held by the township chief. Below the township is a village (street), with a reserve team in each village, and the team leader concurrently held by the village chief or street chief. Recently, autumn is ending and winter is coming, and the rice harvest has been completed. The authorities are taking advantage of the agricultural leisure to recruit strong men from various townships into the army for three months of military training. The enlistment will begin in early November, and the method of recruiting strong men will be handled as usual (October 20th).</p>
<h3 id="e80">Fujian-Sui Headquarters Moves to Jian'ou; Zhangsha Welcomes Jiang Dingwen; Jiang Expresses Sincere Words to the People of Fujian; Sui Headquarters Personnel Leave Zhangzhou in Two Batches <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: The Pacification Headquarters in Fujian, under the order of the Military Commission, moved from Zhangzhou to Jian'ou in northern Fujian. Pacification Director Jiang Dingwen entered Fujian during the suppression of the rebellion. After the suppression of the Communist bandits, he stationed in Zhangzhou for three years. Now that he is about to move, all sectors of Zhangzhou and Xiamen specially held meetings to bid farewell. Jiang came to Xiamen from Zhangzhou on the 15th. On the 16th, all sectors of Xiamen's party, government, military, business, industry, and academia held a public banquet for Jiang at the Municipal Government. During the banquet, Party Affairs Commissioner Chen Lianfen delivered a farewell speech, followed by Jiang's reply, which roughly stated: "I was ordered to come to Fujian on November 20th, 1933, and three years have passed in a flash. During this period, I suppressed the rebellion and suppressed the Communist bandits. Thanks to the central government's prestige and the soldiers' efforts, and the assistance of the people, we gradually achieved peace. It is not something I dare to take credit for. In November 1934, I was ordered to pacify Fujian, and it has been almost two years since then. I feel sorry that I have not yet completed it. Southern Fujian, especially Xiamen, has a special environment and complex situation. It is particularly difficult to deal with. We should overcome all difficulties, work together, and move towards the road of national revival together. Then the future is bright and we can wait and see. Secondly, when the Chang bandit area was recovered, the Department of Education held special education to transform the people in the bandit area. I think this special education should be expanded and implemented in the coastal areas of southern Fujian to enhance the national consciousness of the people in the coastal areas so that they will not forget their original face. I am ordered to move to Jian'ou, and I will start my journey in the next few days. If I take the waterway, I will first go to Fuzhou, then to Yanping. If I follow the land route, I will first go to Longyan, then to Liancheng Yong'an and then to Yanping to Jian'ou."</p>
<p>On the morning of the 19th, Jiang returned to Zhangzhou from Xiamen. At 3 p.m., all sectors of Zhangzhou also held a farewell meeting at the Lianhuan Society. During the banquet, Jiang gave a reply, stating: "(1) In the three years since I entered Fujian, the first year was the period of suppressing the rebellion and suppressing the bandits, and the second and third years were the period of pacification. Most of the large bandits have been defeated. Now there are still a few scattered bandits. Because the army is often transferred, they have not been completely eliminated, which is regrettable for the suffering of the people. (2) I hope that intellectuals and local gentry and business leaders in Zhangzhou can set an example, take responsibility, and create a path for the country and the nation."</p>
<p>As for the relocation of the Pacification Headquarters, Chief of Staff Li Jianai has led the advance team to Jian'ou last week to make arrangements. The personnel and supplies of each department, the first batch of more than 120 people and files, will take the Wuyang Wheel to Fuzhou from Xiamen on the 22nd, and then go to Jian'ou. The second batch will be completely evacuated from Zhangzhou by the end of the month. The Sui Headquarters will also cease operations in Zhangzhou on the 28th. At the end of last month, the Special Supervisors sent to western Fujian and Zhangzhou and Quanzhou will also return to Zhangzhou before the 25th. Jiang will take the Fuquan Zhang bus to the province from Zhangzhou on the morning of the 21st, and will stay for a short time before transferring to Jian'ou (October 21st).</p>
<h3 id="e81">Zhenjiang Investigates Flowing Food <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Department of Finance believes that the food production and sales situation in various counties of the province has been roughly statistically analyzed. However, the flow of food in various city markets is not yet fully understood. Therefore, special commissioners are dispatched to various places for investigation. The department's investigation of the flow of food is of a trial nature, with a time limit of six months and a budget of 1,800 yuan. The current scope of investigation is temporarily divided into five districts: Jinpu, Hu-Ning, Jiangnan, Lixiahe, Song, Li, and neighboring province markets. Special personnel are dispatched to reside and investigate. After the above-mentioned places have achieved success, other city markets will be investigated.</p>

<p>Deng Xianghai, the magistrate of Wu County, is aware that bandit alarms have been frequent in various townships recently, and the people are restless. During this autumn harvest season, it is urgent to strictly arrest bandits to ensure local peace. Therefore, he specially ordered the Public Security Bureau to strictly arrest bandits under its jurisdiction. Director Zhang, upon receiving the order, has already ordered various sub-bureaus to strictly arrest bandits, and pay special attention to local ruffians and hooligans.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Xu Wancheng Punished for Defamation <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The case of Xu Wancheng, editor of Shanghai Longwen Bookstore, defaming the judicial community has been tried by the Wu County Local Court designated by the High Court, and the trial has been concluded. At 4 p.m. on the 20th, the judgment was made: Xu Wancheng was fined 30 yuan for publishing words that defamed others, with a two-year suspended sentence.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Yangcheng Lake Crabs Also Have a Good Harvest <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>The famous autumn products of Wu County, Yangcheng Lake crabs, are produced in Xiangcheng District and Weiting District. The annual output is about 2,000 dans, mainly sold to Shanghai, Nanjing, and Suzhou. This autumn, the output of Yangcheng crabs is particularly high. According to the more than 200 fishing boats in Yangcheng Lake that specialize in catching lake crabs, this year's harvest can reach at least 3,000 dans. Currently, the market price of large-sized lake crabs in the production area is 40 yuan per dan, and the secondary grade is 35 to 30 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Kunshan Malignant Malaria Epidemic <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Since the beginning of autumn, the weather here has been abnormal, causing malignant malaria to easily spread. Although it has been found in the urban area, the number is still small. However, in rural areas such as Zhengyi, Bacheng, Pengmin, and Yangxiangjing, the surrounding villages have spread severely and are difficult to prevent. Deaths due to this are often heard, and the situation is serious. Currently, in order to seek treatment, the local authorities have organized a mobile malaria eradication team from the County Hospital, which will set off immediately to carry out its work.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Wuxi Yarn and Cloth Prices Soar Endlessly <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>The market price of cotton yarn in the county is soaring. Because the factory's current yarn is scarce, there is a situation of supply falling short of demand. On the 20th, the market price of each brand soared by 10 to 12 yuan. Various yarn shops think highly of the price and are still unwilling to sell the existing goods. The reasons are: (1) The sales of cotton cloth are more prosperous than in the past. In Shanghai, because the currency system of Guangdong and Guangxi has been unified with the central government, the cotton cloth trade in these two provinces is ordering in large quantities from Shanghai, resulting in a large decrease in cotton cloth; (2) After improvement, Chinese cotton is almost the same as American cotton, but the price is lower than American cotton. Therefore, Japanese merchants, in addition to buying as much cotton as possible in North China, are also ordering it in Shanghai and other places, resulting in Chinese yarn factories lacking raw materials, while sales are very active. Therefore, under this situation, the price of cotton yarn cannot be stopped, breaking the record of more than ten years. Compared with the lowest time in the local yarn market, it has risen by nearly 40 yuan per piece. The market price is still continuing to rise; (3) The price of yarn has also soared, and the price of cotton textiles has also risen accordingly. The original price of 16-pound coarse cloth produced by local factories such as Qingfeng, Gengyu, and Shenxin was 9 yuan per piece, but recently it has risen to 11 yuan, and there is no stock available for sale. The price of mercerized money cloth in various city markets has also soared, rising by 3 to 5 cents per yard. All the stocks of various cloth factories have been collected by various silk shops. Yesterday, the price of Shuangyu Gengyu coarse cloth broke the 12 yuan mark.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Rice Market Prices Remain Firm <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Wuxi has always been a gathering area for rice. Anhui Province is a rice-producing area. Therefore, whenever the new grains are harvested, general merchants transport rice to Wuxi for sale. The opening price is usually lower, but although the goods in various rice shops are pouring in, the market price remains firm. Qingbai japonica rice is 9 yuan and 1 jiao per stone. According to people in the industry, the reasons for the firm rice market this time are: Although this autumn harvest is better than last year, and the goods arriving are also more than in previous years, there are fewer rice merchants from Anhui Province selling in Wuxi than last year. This is because a certain party recently sent Chinese businessmen to purchase large quantities of rice in the Su-Wan area, load them onto sea vessels, and transport them to a certain country. Therefore, the market price in Wuxi is unlikely to fall in the near future.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Special Goods Oversupplied <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The local opium houses, opium dens, and opium smoking places that previously received the second annual business license have now expired. Now that the third annual session has begun, they have all submitted a report to the county government requesting to continue their business. After County Magistrate Long approved the opium houses Dachang, Yongxing, Futai, Jiatian, the opium dens Yitai, Dalong, Yuanji, Dasheng, Yonghe, Qiuguang, Yongda, Xinxing, Yunji, Xiexin, Shengli, Youli, Xiecheng, and thirteen others, and the opium smoking places Luo Hongchang, Shenchang, Yongyu, Zhenxin, and fifty-seven others, they submitted a report to the Department of Civil Affairs for review yesterday. Also, the local official soil market price has gradually soared. Yuntu has risen by 2 jiao and 4 fen per liang. The original price was 1 yuan and 7 jiao, but now it costs 2 yuan and 9 jiao and 4 fen. Moreover, various opium houses and shops have very few sources, and there is a danger of running out of stock due to oversupply. Smokers throughout the county are in a state of panic.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Yangzhou Director Jian of the Department Arrives in Yangzhou for Inspection <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Wanfu Bridge in the east of this county is a necessary passage for transportation in Yangzhou, Taizhou and other places. Since it was destroyed by Sun Jun in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, the bridge has been a large project and it is not easy to repair. Although local people have been running around to raise funds for repairs, it has been difficult to work due to the difficulty of fundraising. Later, the National Economic Council and the Jiangsu Provincial Government allocated funds for repairs, which started this spring. After several months, the work was often stopped due to insufficient funds and materials, which made it difficult for the bridge to be completed. It is now known that Shen Baixian, Director of the Department of Construction, came to Yangzhou from the province on the morning of the 21st with technical personnel to inspect the actual situation of the project and complete the bridge as soon as possible, and then went to Wanfu Bridge for inspection.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Truth About Bai Shulan Robbery Case <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the case of the robbery of Wang Yuanzhang, a clerk of the Jiangsu Bank, who was robbed of ten yuan of remittances from a Zhou family in Dongguan Street in the old city of Jiangdu, the county government, according to the report of accountant Jiang Yingbo and the oral statements of Wang Yuanzhang, immediately ordered the Public Security Investigation Team and the Third Sub-station in charge to arrest and investigate the robbers. Now, Hu Yaozhen, the detective of the team, has learned the truth. Wang Yuanzhang is addicted to gambling. When passing through Five Lane, he saw a gambling table and participated in gambling, losing eight yuan. He used the ten yuan bill for remittance to find two yuan back (both red Jiaotong Bank bills). Later, Wang felt cheated and argued with the stall owner, intending to reclaim it. Seeing that the situation was not good, the stall owners fled together. Jiang witnessed this. When Wang chased after Jiang, he embellished the report that he had been robbed. Yesterday (19th), the detective led detectives Cui Xingwu and arrested a gambler named Cao Wanyuan at the west entrance of Duomai Lane. He confessed the same as before and summoned Wang Yuanzhang to the team to confront him. It is said that both sides have requested to be exempted from further investigation, and Cao compensated Wang for his losses. The original was detained by the team, waiting for further interrogation.</p>

<p>The epidemic in Tongyi has recently spread to a wider area. In addition to recruiting more than 60 doctors from various hospitals and health agencies to depart for diagnosis and treatment, the Epidemic Prevention Association is also sending a large number of medical personnel to Nantong to prevent and control the epidemic. A military and police inspectorate has been established in Tongyi to eliminate vagrants, bandits, and detect reactionary elements, and maintain law and order. Zhang Weiqun, the commander of the district security headquarters, and Hu Ruilin, the commander of the garrison troops, were appointed as the director and deputy director respectively. Three divisions of general affairs, detective, and inspectorate were established, and three teams of patrol, detective, and inspection were formed.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Danyang Monster Found in Fish Pond <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>In the daming river pond in Xujiawei, east of Yaojia Bridge in this county, it is said that there is a very fierce water ghost. After nightfall, the villagers warned each other not to walk past it. Those who mistakenly walked near it would be fascinated and drown without realizing it. A villager named Zhang, a local rich man, refuted the idea of ghosts and gods. One night, he secretly carried a pistol and walked alone along the shore. Before long, he felt that his movements were slightly restricted, as if he was being pulled by something in the dark. He felt a little timid, but then he regained his spirit and moved forward bravely. Suddenly, he saw an object lying in the pond, shaped like a giant tortoise, raising its head outwards, frequently sucking in its breath, as if using it to pull pedestrians into the pond. Zhang knew that the so-called haunting of the water ghost must be this thing. He quickly raised his gun and shot it from a distance, and there was a sound of falling into the water. The next morning, he told the villagers what he had seen. The villagers drained the fish pond and searched for it. They found an object, its body as soft as cotton, less than a foot long, unlike the giant tortoise seen last night, but one of its feet was injured, obviously a gunshot wound. So they captured it and placed it in a large tank in the ancestral hall, filled with water. The monster swelled up, and the tank could not hold it, and it even burst. When the water was drained, it shrank back to its original shape. As for what it is, there is no way to name it. Therefore, it is recorded for the study of naturalists.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Jiaxing Establishment of Collection Sub-Counter <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>In order to reorganize the income of land taxes and eliminate long-standing malpractices, the Jiaxing County Government has set up land registration officers to collect land taxes and abolish tax collection officials. It is now planning to set up collection sub-counters in the urban area, Xinfeng, Xinzhen, Wangdian, Wangjiangjing and other places. All the personnel have been allocated and will be announced soon. The office buildings of each sub-counter are currently being sought and repaired. Each sub-counter will be established in early November, with a temporary period of three months to facilitate local payments by grain households. As for households with outstanding taxes, they are now being transferred and urged by the Tax Collection Office, so the number of collections has gradually improved recently.</p>

<p>The Zhejiang Literature Exhibition hosted by the Zhejiang Provincial Library has been decided by the design committee at a standing committee meeting due to the approaching exhibition period: (1) The exhibition date will be changed to November 1st and will close on the 15th; (2) The exhibition venue will be decided at the Provincial Library on Daxue Road, but a part of the rubbings will be displayed at the Gushan Branch. The Zhejiang provincial product collection sub-committees have mostly shipped cultural relics to Hangzhou. In the Ning district, in addition to a few counties such as Cixiao sending them by post, they still need to wait for the Tianyi Pavilion to transport books before sending them together. A lot of precious books were collected in the Wen district, and they have been transferred to Hangzhou via Shanghai, totaling 17 large wooden boxes and more than 560 pieces of cultural relics, and the registration and editing have begun.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Sanjiang Lock Siltation Reorganization <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The Qianjiang Shaoxing Duantang Lock Project Office believes that since the beginning of autumn, the weather has been dry and Cao'e River has a small flow and low water level. Now it is dry to 5.63 meters, while the autumn tide in the outer port is surging and the mud and sand are swelling with the tide, reaching 6.05 meters, exceeding the inland river water level by 0.42 meters. The river flow is far away from the Sanjiang Lock, resulting in a lock port of more than ten miles long. After the Wang Fan tide in August of the lunar calendar, the lock port was completely silted up, and a special report was submitted to the Department of Construction. The provincial government plans to make fundamental improvements, which must wait for the completion of the river mouth plan and the determination of the river bank line before starting. The current relief method should be to temporarily hire workers to excavate, then release water for flushing, and when the silted sand increases to 5 centimeters above the inland river surface, one or two holes should be opened for flushing. The project office has been ordered to investigate the actual situation and apply it as appropriate.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Ningbo Hengfeng Factory Debt Dispute <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Hengfeng Cloth Factory in Ningbo owed Dayuanzhuang 33,900 yuan in national currency and Ruifengzhuang more than 5,200 yuan. The two sides had a dispute and were involved in litigation at the Zheng County Local Court. The local court then ruled that the debt should be repaid in six equal installments within six months. Hengfeng refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the High Court, which scheduled a hearing on the 24th of this month. The two villages, Dayuan and Ruifeng, operate on the basis of deposits and loans from money houses. If the debt can be repaid in installments and the deposits can be withdrawn at any time, the operation of the money house will be in danger. Moreover, Hengfeng Factory has ample assets and the shareholders are very wealthy. Whether it is the partnership property or the shareholders' capital, it is possible to pay off the debt in one lump sum. Te Xing asked the Money Industry Association to transfer a letter to the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, which was sent to the party and government organs for detailed explanation, and transferred a letter to the Third Branch of the Zhejiang Higher Court for investigation, requesting to amend the judgment to repay in one lump sum in order to maintain the money industry.</p>

(2) Strengthening the martial arts department. In addition to the original Tan Tui, Tai Chi, Fanzi, Mantis, and Chaquan styles, which are taught by famous masters such as Zhao Yunhe, Wu Jianquan, Zhao Shouchun, and Chen Guoqing, there will be a martial arts lecture and a performance once a month. For Western boxing, a sparring class has been established, and Chen Hanqiang has been hired as the instructor. Ping Weiren, who recently won a championship in the Nanyang Islands, has also joined the training. (3) Reorganizing the table tennis team. This team is one of the four strongest teams in Shanghai.

"Improved" refers to schools that have adopted school textbooks; "unimproved" refers to schools that have not yet adopted school textbooks. In addition, Hunan Province has been able to utilize improved private schools to establish inter-school associations, but the number has not yet been reported and is therefore not included.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Zhejiang Literature Exhibition's Exhibits Substantially Enriched Opening Date Revised to November 1st at Provincial Library Exhibits from Various Regions of Zhejiang and Beijing-Shanghai Arriving in Hangzhou <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education, in order to promote local literature and advocate scholarship, designated the Provincial Library to organize the Zhejiang Literature Exhibition. A design committee and exhibit collection subcommittees in Beijing-Shanghai and other regions were formed, and preparations have been underway for several months. Previously, the Department of Education had instructed all counties to first organize county literature exhibitions, and then to select the best exhibits to send to Hangzhou. Most counties complied with the order and held exhibitions. After the exhibitions, many sent exhibits to their respective regional subcommittees for compilation. The Provincial Library sent personnel to collect the exhibits, or the exhibits were sent directly from various locations. As of yesterday, exhibits had arrived from Hangzhou County, Tonglu, Yuhang, former Jiaxing, Huzhou, Shaoxing, Jinhua, Quzhou, Cixi, Dinghai, Taishun, and other areas, totaling over 5,500 items. Wenzhou, Yin County, Pinghu, and other areas are either en route or awaiting collection and transport. In Beijing, dozens of rare treasures from private collections have been transported to Nanjing. The Shanghai exhibit collection subcommittee has gathered a collection. The library sent a representative to Beijing on the 16th to make arrangements. It is reported that the Relics Preservation Society, the Institute of History and Philology, and various public and private parties have been supportive and have offered many exhibits. The preparatory work for the exhibition is being carried out by a portion of the Provincial Library's staff as volunteers. Due to the late arrival of exhibits from distant regions and the time required for editing, the original opening date of October 26th was deemed too hasty. After deliberation at the Standing Committee meeting of the Design Committee yesterday (the 19th), the opening date was revised to November 1st and the closing date to November 15th, to allow for continued collection and arrangement. The Standing Committee also resolved several issues related to the grouping and examination of exhibits. It is reported that the exhibits sent by various parties include rare Zhejiang local chronicles, manuscript copies of writings by distinguished figures, calligraphy, rubbings of bronze and stone inscriptions, clothing and items used by local worthies, and relics of Zhejiang revolutionary martyrs. Many of the exhibits collected are valuable. Rare books from the Tianyi Pavilion and Jiaye Library will also be exhibited. At that time, the confluence of various strengths will surely create a magnificent spectacle. The collection work in Shanghai is continuing, and those who are enthusiastic about supporting the effort can contact the Ningbo Road Fuyuan Money Exchange exhibit collection subcommittee.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Food prices, especially flour, surged and hit the upper daily limit The forward price has reached 3.9025 yuan, the highest peak since the exchange was founded <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market for each month showed an upward trend again, setting a new record high. Although the quotation of foreign wheat was flat, due to the strong momentum of the traders, it was impossible to speculate based on common sense. As a result, the market price rose and fell sharply. When prices rose, the market was full of bullish sentiment. The opening price immediately rose by one or two cents. Then, the off-market big players frequently traded and bought up the supply. The factory owners in this city and other cities and towns, seeing the difficulty in buying wheat, were silent and allowed the price to rise sharply. As a result, the market soared, and made significant progress. During the day, a total of 700,000 to 800,000 bags of flour were transacted, and the market increased by seven to eight cents. When the market opened in the afternoon, due to the futures wheat market jumping by another corner of a yuan, the market sentiment became even more excited. The opening price for each month rose by a corner of a yuan. Therefore, after the second round of trading, the market was invisibly suspended due to the price limit. This is the highest peak since the establishment of the exchange. The market price in March reached 3.9025 yuan. If there were no daily price limits, it might have reached an alarming record of 4 yuan. It is not known whether the relevant authorities have noticed this.</p>

<h3 id="e121">The price of future wheat has not stopped rising The far-term has soared by a huge 0.256 yuan <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the futures wheat market, the prices for all months jumped across the board at the opening, and the degree of increase was unprecedented in recent years. The prices for December and January have increased by a huge 0.256 yuan. This situation is as if there is already a shortage of food, causing speculators to raise prices arbitrarily. At the opening price, the sentiment of off-market investors was good. Although there were many transactions, the prices for each month rose by varying amounts of 0.04 to 0.07 yuan. When the market opened in the afternoon, due to the active participation of the cotton yarn and securities traders, the narrow market was unable to resist the huge forces. As a result, the opening price jumped across the board by 0.123 yuan, and the trading was unprecedented. Since then, the market has been calm for the recent two months, and the far-term has continued to be good. This situation is not related to actual sales and is purely speculative. According to this trend, after the price is raised step by step, it will inevitably approach the pricing of foreign wheat before stopping. Currently, the price of wheat is high, and transactions are not smooth. The price of medium-quality wheat has risen by 0.15 yuan. The price of Shandong Nansu wheat is 6 yuan, the price of Yanghe wheat is 6 yuan, the price of second-quality wheat is 5.98 yuan, the price of third-quality wheat is 5.95 yuan, the price of Jiangbei wheat is 5.79 yuan, the price of Yaowan wheat is 5.91 yuan, the price of Guangshui wheat is 5.7 yuan, the price of Zhumadian wheat is 5.85 yuan, and the price of Zhuzhen wheat is 5.9 yuan. Fuxin sold 4,000 bags, and Shentai sold 1,000 bags.</p>

<p>Yesterday, about 10,000 bags of rice arrived, but traders from various regions were even more eager to purchase, especially traders from Guangzhou and Shantou. Traders in this street took the opportunity to purchase. Traders from Guangzhou vigorously searched for unpolished rice, but the supply of unpolished rice in the market was scarce. All of the rice in the hands of hawkers was purchased by traders from Guangzhou. Yesterday, the price was raised to 8.78 yuan to purchase high-quality unpolished rice, but they were still unable to purchase as much as they wanted. Therefore, they only purchased 1,000 to 2,000 bags of unpolished Yangjian, early unpolished machine-milled rice, and rice flour. Traders from Shantou and this street purchased machine-milled rice. The market price immediately soared by 0.23 yuan. If the volume of sales continues to be strong, the market price may rise further. A total of 8,450 bags of Jiangxi rice, 2,500 bags of Hunan rice, 200 bags of Shatou rice, and 1,000 bags of unpolished rice were sold throughout the day.</p>

<p>(South of Shanghai) Yesterday, more than 30 firms arrived from various sources, with a total of more than 6,000 stones of rice. Sales in this street were flat, but the volume of packaged rice was strong. Traders from Pingjin, Yanwei, and other regions purchased 1,400 bags of new thin rice, nearly 1,000 bags of thick new japonica rice, and 400 to 500 bags of thin broken rice. As a result, the market price was stable. As a result, the market price for green seed and Baekga increased by 0.03 yuan. The price of new japonica rice increased by nearly 0.1 yuan. Due to the shortage of supply and fragrance, the price of Duyang Jian has increased by as much as 0.12 yuan. The price of thick and thin broken japonica rice has also increased. The color of new Yin Yuan is still fresh.</p>
<p>(North of Shanghai) Yesterday, 25 or 26 ships arrived from the cities along the river. Sales of various types of rice in the market, such as new japonica rice, Yang Dubu Jian, new Yin Yuan, and green seeds, turned better, while the sales of broken japonica rice and new and old rice remained sluggish. The market price of high-quality new japonica rice was stable, and the price of medium-quality rice increased by several cents. The prices of Yang Dubu and Ke Jian also increased by 0.03 to 0.04 yuan. The price of new Yin Yuan increased by about 0.1 yuan. The price of broken japonica rice continued to fall by nearly 0.1 yuan. The price of new and old rice fell by 0.12 yuan.</p>

<p>Recently, the gradual reduction in the inventory of raw silk in New York has led to the repeated rise in the silk market between Japan and the United States. As of yesterday, the selling prices of current and forward contracts have risen by an average of about 40 yuan compared to the beginning of this month. The prices of near and far futures in New York have also risen by about seven points. As a result, silk sales in Shanghai this week have become more active. The prices of exported silk are soaring, and the appetite is strong, which is only seen in the past two months. Yesterday, the prices of New York, Shanghai, and Guangdong silk held firm, as factories were in great need and inventories were low, so they rose by another three points. Japanese silk only rose by one or two points. Yokohama spot prices continued to rise by five yuan, and forward prices by a small one yuan. Sales of American silk firm's silk in Shanghai continued to be brisk, and French silk was also satisfactory. Selling prices rose by 30 yuan compared to the beginning of this week. Market sentiment is increasingly optimistic, so silk sales to users also became active yesterday, and the appetite was not weak, making the silk market even more profitable. Yesterday, more than 580 bales of silk were traded in Shanghai, with domestic sales accounting for about one-fifth.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Yarn Flower: Yarn Market Waves Rise and Fall, Differing Bull and Bear Views Cause Sudden Ups and Downs, Highest This Month Reaching 240 Yuan, Unfavorable Afternoon News Causes Slight Decline, Current Yarn Stabilizes Around 6 Yuan <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Yarn Market: Ups and downs, sudden rises and falls, like a storm. Market sentiment is chaotic and inconsistent, with bulls and bears out of step. In reality, prices have reached a high level, full of twists and turns. However, it is said that a certain major player from the past has already gone long in the November futures, preparing to take delivery. Therefore, buying momentum is strong, and new peaks are frequently reached, rising to 240 yuan this month. It is found that there are still 9,000 bales left in the account. November penetrated 30 yuan outside to 230 yuan. However, on-site yarn sales are sluggish and difficult. Everyone is taking a wait-and-see attitude. Therefore, during the third session in the afternoon, the market became restless, with unfavorable news causing declines in various months. The market rebounded at the close, but remained in chaos for the time being, with frequent trading continuing until late at night. Observing the overall trend, the bulls are holding onto November without letting go. A certain individual is using their skills, dragging in on this number and selling heavily on that number, causing the market price to fluctuate and surge. In short, prices are too high, and once there is a reaction, it will be difficult to stop. One must be cautious.</p>
<p>The November Futures Market is Especially Strong</p>
<p>The labeled yarn market opened with calm. October remained unchanged, November fell by five cents, and distant months rose by 1.13 to 0.20 yuan. March remained unchanged. In the second session, the bullish trend rose again, but the current yarn situation was exceptionally weak, with selling prices flat. It is said that the customer group is actually selling, and the Tianjin group is offering a large number of long positions, so the upward momentum is not strong. Unexpectedly, in the third session, the near-month gains were particularly strong, surpassing the previous day's high. This month was 239.90 yuan, and November was 251 yuan. However, the last two months fell by 0.09 to 1.00 yuan. By the time of closing, the near-month recovered by 0.05 yuan, and the distant month rose by 0.56 yuan. The results for labeled yarn showed near-month prices up 3.50 yuan from the previous day's closing price, and distant-month prices up 2.20 to 1.00 yuan. The market opened at 3:00 PM, with near-month gains particularly rapid. This month reached 40 yuan, November 32 yuan, and distant months were slightly flat. The third session suddenly fell by more than 2.00 yuan, claiming that foreign reports were inaccurate. By the time of closing, the market situation this month was still flat, with November uniquely strong, and distant months also rebounding by 0.80 to 0.90 yuan. The results for this month were down 2.00 yuan from the morning closing price, with remaining months up or down by 0.348 to 1.00 yuan. Confirmed sales included: Sen Kang 3,000 bales, Da Fu 2,500 bales, Tong Ji 1,500 bales, Ju Xing 2,050 bales, Jin Chang 2,250 bales, Zhen Da 1,050 bales, Tai Xing 1,000 bales, Ming Hua 1,150 bales, Geng Feng 2,900 bales, Da Chang Cheng 1,450 bales, Yi Chang 1,950 bales, Run Kang 2,900 bales, Yong Da 2,100 bales, Yi Ji 1,050 bales, Ming De 2,150 bales. Purchases included: Yu Da 9,550 bales, Yu Kang 1,400 bales, Da Feng 2,500 bales, Shen Chang 4,350 bales, Ren Feng 1,650 bales, Wang Tai Xing 1,450 bales, Chang Yu 5,000 bales, Tai Xing 1,400 bales. The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Current Yarn Prices Too High, Sales Stagnate</p>
<p>Current yarn sales have turned sluggish, with customers hesitant to purchase due to high prices. It is found that the various groups purchased only 394 bales for the entire day, with selling prices flat. Thread prices fell by 5 to 6 yuan, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e126">This Month's Flower Futures Surge Two Yuan Due to Short Squeeze, Rumors of Japanese Merchants Ordering Indian Cotton, Distant Month Gains Gradually Ease <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market's October futures surged sharply due to a short squeeze, showing a strong trend. This is because retail investors sold too much. Although short sellers delivered goods, the remaining amount in the account is still a huge 12 ten thousand dan. Coupled with the good yarn market, buyers are very eager. However, some say that Japanese merchants have ordered Indian Oomra cotton, so the distant month's gains are relatively moderate. Investigating the inside story, someone is also acting. Tai Chang Yu Da suddenly purchased aggressively, jumping wildly by 0.09 yuan to close at 43.50 yuan.</p>
<p>Labeled Cotton Short Sellers Scramble to Cover</p>
<p>The labeled cotton market opened with a violent surge this month. The October delivery issue has not yet been resolved. According to the market, disputes arose between the old and new long companies. Short sellers cannot fulfill delivery, so short sellers cover their positions, and the market price rises by 0.06 yuan. Distant months also enter a good state. After the first session, the yarn market's upward momentum was even stronger, resulting in each month rising by 0.678 to 1.15 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. A sudden decline occurred in the second session, with various rumors spreading. Because short sellers secured a loan at a certain bank with 24,000 dan of coarse cotton warehouse receipts, which have been sent to the inspection office, this month fell by 0.03 yuan, and distant months followed with a wild plunge of 0.56 yuan. This kind of violent situation is rare in recent times. The market stabilized during the session. By the time of closing, there was talk of a short squeeze this month, jumping wildly by 0.09 yuan to 42.50 yuan, with the rest also rising accordingly. Yu Da sold in the morning and bought in the afternoon. It was found that Ming De sold 7,600 dan, Da Feng 5,200 dan, Ming Hua 3,000 dan, Feng 12,900 dan, Shen Chang 5,000 dan, Sen Kang 19,200 dan, Da Chang Cheng 9,100 dan, Chang Feng 6,500 dan, Run Kang 5,000 dan, Xin Cheng 15,700 dan, Fu Kang 4,100 dan, and Ju Xing 7,500 dan. Purchases included Da Fu 3,800 dan, Yi Cheng 10,000 dan, Wang Tai Yu 8,800 dan, Tai Xing 4,500 dan, Zhen Da 6,000 dan, Rui Da 6,600 dan, Xing Chang 3,300 dan, Tai Chang 12,800 dan, Yi Lian 6,200 dan, Xin Chang 8,100 dan, Chang He 31,800 dan, and Ren Feng 3,100 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed on the left.</p>

<p>Current Cotton Prices High, Sales Clear</p>
<p>Current cotton consumption is slightly clear, but because prices are too high, the buying party has reduced purchases again. The source is Yao cotton 3,490 bales, Tongzhou cotton 1,900 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e127">New American Cotton Sales Slow <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened with months down 6 points or up 2 points. Early in the morning, Liverpool news was unfavorable, foreign merchants sold, cotton farmers hedged, and bulls closed out. However, counterparts bought in at lower prices, and new cotton movement was slow. At the same time, current cotton and cloth needs are active, all enough to arouse the interest of bulls. Southern hedging has gradually decreased, and sellers are also wary, so market transactions are relatively clear. The weather report stated sunny weather in the east, clouds or rain in North Carolina and Georgia, cloudy weather in the center, with possible rain on Wednesday, rain in Arkansas tonight, and cloudy weather in the west. The market closed steady, with spot prices down 4 points and futures down 7 to 10 points. Indian cotton initially fell due to futures traders selling and bulls closing out, then rose due to European producers buying in, and finally softened again due to Liverpool news being quietly favorable. Calculated, Pingguo fell 1.25 rupees twice, Oomra fell 1.75 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell 2.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (19th dispatch).</p>

<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market situation: with the current yarn and thread situation slightly loose, cotton cloth also softened slightly in futures due to continuous surges, while spot goods remained firm. Many hand goods were sold. The prices of East Goods fine cloth and fine twill warehouse order goods fell uniformly by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan (per piece). Japanese factories opened orders for fine cloth and fine twill futures for December, 600-700 pieces. Changzhou's various weaving factories opened orders for more than 300 pieces of fine twill for November, purchased by the Guangdong group. In recent days, the Guangdong group has been delivering and releasing a lot of pre-ordered fine twill from various factories. Local coarse cloth factories are demanding very high prices. The factory price for 16-pound coarse cloth from Ren Zhong is 11.50 yuan. Hand goods sold in the market are slightly cheaper.

Most of the orders allocated to factories by various groups daily are overdue. It is said that this is all due to the shortage of current yarn and thread. The current market price is soaring, and customers are urging delivery even more urgently, it is said.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange market initially rose sharply due to the favorable atmosphere surrounding the negotiations, but later fell due to unfavorable news about the fifth subscription. In reality, the market in this environment, rising by one yuan, naturally caused a rebound. How the negotiations will go is difficult to predict. The situation on the table is very strong. Class C, which failed to break out of 60.05 yuan three times, actually broke out to more than 1 yuan yesterday. At the morning opening, buyers with number 43 were the most eager, and retail investors also covered their positions. Class E was softer, while Classes A and B were the firmest, rising by 0.015 to 0.045 yuan. In the second session, buying of numbers 22 and 33 was the liveliest. Selling of numbers 11 and 54 was also quite active. Market prices still rose by 0.01 to 0.03 yuan. At the afternoon opening, numbers 35, 44, and 53 sold against the wind again. Class C actually still broke out of 61 yuan, with buying of numbers 11 and 32 being extremely strong, rising another 0.015 to 0.04 yuan. This kind of market price has not been seen for several weeks. At the closing, rumors rose again, and market prices fell back by 0.01 to 0.03 yuan. Market sentiment was stable, and the market price ultimately rose uniformly by 0.045 to 0.08 yuan. The total number of transactions was 1,265,000 yuan. The results of the rises and falls are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>

<p>— Ru Bi</p>
<p>Not long after the founding of the Jin Dynasty, because Emperor Hui was too foolish, the empire was thrown into great chaos. Initially, there were eight imperial princes—Prince Lun of Zhao, Prince Jiong of Qi, Prince Ying of Chengdu, Prince Yong of Hejian, Prince Yi of Changsha, Prince Yue of Donghai, Prince Zhang of Chu, and Prince Mo of Nanyang—who fought each other for power and profit, killing and driving each other away, causing endless turmoil. At this time, Liu Yuan, the Left Worthy Prince of the Xiongnu, saw the great chaos in the Jin Dynasty as a good opportunity to seize the empire. Therefore, he was unwilling to be a vassal state of the Jin Dynasty and ascended to the throne as emperor, establishing the Han Dynasty. Because Liu Yuan considered himself the nephew of the Han Dynasty, inheriting the throne as a nephew inheriting his uncle's position, he named his dynasty Han.</p>
<p>Soon after, Liu Yuan died, and his son Liu Cong inherited the throne. At this time, the internal affairs of the Jin Dynasty were even more chaotic. Liu Cong ordered his generals Shi Le, Liu Yao, and Huyan Yan to lead troops to attack the Jin Dynasty. How could the Jin troops resist? Emperors Huai and Min were captured by the Han troops one after another, and were subsequently killed by Liu Cong. As a result, the areas north of the Yangtze River were occupied by the Xiongnu generals.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the areas south of the Yangtze River remained peaceful. A member of the Jin imperial clan, General of Pacifying the East and military governor of Yangzhou and the southern regions of the Yangtze River, Langya King Rui, ascended the throne in Nanjing. By employing capable individuals such as Wang Dao, he managed to safeguard the southern regions.</p>
<p>At this time, the entire northern part of China was in the hands of foreigners. The Han Dynasty was established by the Xiongnu people, with its capital in Pingyang (later changing its dynastic title to Former Zhao). Shi Le, a Jie from Wudu and originally a general under Liu Yuan, later rebelled, destroyed the state established by the Di people, and established the Later Zhao Dynasty. In addition, there were the Former Yan Dynasty established by the Xianbei Murong clan, the Former Liang Dynasty established by the Di people Zhang Gui, the Dai state established by the Xianbei Tuoba clan, and the Former Qin Dynasty established by the Di people Fu Jian. The Former Qin was the most powerful, and it almost unified northern China and even wanted to destroy the Jin Dynasty, which was clinging to power in the south of the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>This era is known in Chinese history as the "Five Barbarians' Uprising in China."</p>
<p>Zu Ti was born in this era of great turmoil.</p>
<p>Zu Ti, styled Shiya, was from Fanyang. His father died when he was still a child. He had a very forthright temperament, was generous in giving, and practiced chivalry. Although he was already fourteen or fifteen years old and had not yet made progress in his studies, his brothers were very worried. However, whenever he went to the villages, he would distribute money, rice, cloth, and silk to the poor according to his own will, practicing the principle of "everyone eats when there is food, and everyone uses when there is money." Those who received his assistance thanked him, but he said, "Don't thank me, my brothers told me to distribute these to you. You should thank my brothers."</p>
<p>Zu Ti had several good brothers who not only did not blame him for giving away money, rice, cloth, and silk, but praised him. Because they all felt that money, rice, cloth, and silk were ultimately things that one could not bring into life or take away in death. Using them to help people was what a great man should do. Therefore, they worked hard to do good deeds. Soon, they were highly respected. Anyone who knew the Zu Ti brothers held them in high regard, saying that they would be men of great use in the future.</p>
<p>Year after year passed, and Zu Ti's age gradually increased, and his reputation grew with his age. One day, Zu Ti thought to himself, "Now I have a reputation, but where is my real knowledge? It's just an empty name. If I just continue to be generous, practice chivalry, and do good deeds for the rest of my life, what good will it do for the country and society? Today, the world is in chaos, and it is the time for heroes to repay the country. But without the talent to deal with this chaotic situation, there is nothing I can do. I want to be a useful person, to learn the skills to deal with this situation, and I must find these skills in books. I should study."</p>
<p>Therefore, Zu Ti resolved to study. He diligently read the classics, histories, philosophical works, and literary collections, as long as the books were useful. If he didn't have them at home, he would buy them or borrow them. After reading for several years, Zu Ti's mind was filled with reason.</p>
<p>Zu Ti had a very close friend named Liu Kun, who was also a very handsome young man. They studied literature and practiced martial arts together, and they both had the ambition to drive out the barbarians and restore China. With shared goals and common interests, they became very close.</p>
<p>Sometimes, Zu Ti and Liu Kun would forget the time while studying literature and practicing martial arts, and it would be late at night, so they would rest together. As dawn approached, the rooster raised by the family would stretch its neck and crow. Zu Ti woke up, heard the rooster crowing, and nudged Liu Kun, saying, "Brother, listen, the rooster is crowing. This crowing is very good for people. It's telling people: it's almost dawn, the light is coming soon, everyone get up! Brother, let's not let it down."</p>
<p>Liu Kun also turned over and got up, saying, "Exactly, let's not let it down." So Zu Ti and Liu Kun both drew their swords and danced in the room, the flashing sword light mixing with the lamplight.</p>
<p>After the two finished dancing with their swords, they sat facing each other under the lamp, resting for a while. Zu Ti said, "Now the eight princes are at odds, turning the empire into a mess. The barbarians are taking this opportunity to invade. It seems that the Jin Dynasty won't last long. We have good skills and have learned both literature and martial arts. We should take this opportunity to repay the country. Even if the Jin Dynasty is destroyed, we must do our best to revive China, that is the right thing to do!"</p>
<p>After listening, Liu Kun said, "That's right, we have the same aspirations, and we should do what we can. In the future, when we achieve merit and establish our careers, neither of us should yield to the other. Let's see who achieves his ambition first, that will be a good man. Brother, look, the Central Plains relies on mountains and rivers, a good battlefield. It is a good place for you and me to drive out the barbarians and gallop on horseback."</p>
<p>The two looked at each other and couldn't help but clap their hands and laugh.</p>
<p>Before Emperor Yuan of Jin ascended the throne, he had already heard of Zu Ti's reputation. Now that he had become emperor in Jiangfu and wanted to restore the dynasty, he naturally needed some capable people. Therefore, he issued an edict appointing Zu Ti as Military Counselor (similar to the position of a military advisor). At this time, Zu Ti already had two hundred trusted followers, all of whom were burly men, loyal, righteous, and possessing outstanding martial skills.</p>
<p>At that time, Emperor Yuan had just ascended the throne and was focused on pacifying the southern regions of the Yangtze River. He had no intention of crossing the river to the north to recover the lost territories.</p>
<p>One day during the early court session, Zu Ti stepped forward and reported, "The Jin Dynasty has come to this point not because the ruler is unprincipled, nor because the people are rebelling, but because the eight princes are at odds, fighting among themselves, and not defending the borders. That's why the barbarians have taken advantage of the situation and occupied the Central Plains. Now, the people of the Central Plains have suffered under the barbarians, and everyone wants the restoration of China. Everyone wants the government to send troops. They can all rise up to kill the barbarians. If Your Majesty can send generals and troops, I am willing to be the vanguard and cross the river to the north. At that time, the heroes of the Central Plains will surely respond like the wind, and the heroes of the southern regions of the Yangtze River will surely abandon their families and join the army. The lost territories can be recovered, and the national shame can be washed away. What is Your Majesty's will?"</p>
<p>Emperor Yuan was very moved by Zu Ti's words and immediately appointed Zu Ti as General of Mighty Valor and Governor of Yuzhou. However, there were no troops to send, so he had to give him three thousand bolts of cloth and enough grain for one thousand people, and ordered Zu Ti to recruit troops and act accordingly.</p>
<p>After receiving the decree, Zu Ti returned home, made some preparations, and ordered ships to be prepared to cross the river to the north. Since the court had no troops to send, Zu Ti only took his two hundred personal followers across the river.</p>
<p>As the ship was in the middle of the river, Zu Ti suddenly stood up, raised his hand, struck the oar, and solemnly said, "Zu Ti is determined to cross the river to the north. If I do not recover the Central Plains and kill all the barbarians, I will not cross this river even in death! If I cross, I will surely die in this river!"</p>
<p>Zu Ti's face was very serious when he spoke, and his voice was passionate and intense. The two hundred followers were all moved by his words. Everyone clenched their fists and rubbed their palms, eager to fight the barbarians, recover the lost territories, and wash away the national shame!</p>
<p>After crossing the Yangtze River, Zu Ti established his main camp in Huaiyin. On one hand, he rushed to manufacture armor and weapons, and on the other hand, he raised a large banner with the words "Loyalty and Righteousness" and recruited heroes. Soon, patriots from the Yellow River and Yangtze River regions had joined Zu Ti's command, numbering two thousand people.</p>
<p>After training these two thousand people, Zu Ti advanced his troops, first resolving those miscellaneous troops who were ostensibly militia but were actually traitors by either disbanding them or accepting their surrender. Only then did he formally engage in battle with the troops of Shi Le of Later Zhao. Shi Hu, Shi Le's nephew, was a famous general known throughout the land, but he was defeated by Zu Ti through trickery, and all the barbarian generals lost their courage. As a result, the people in the Yellow River region who had not forgotten their homeland responded to Zu Ti. Shi Le's soldiers and generals could not hold their ground and fled. The areas south of the Yellow River were all recovered. Shi Le, fearing Zu Ti's power, sent people to Zu Ti's hometown to protect his ancestral tombs and sent people to Zu Ti to negotiate peace and trade. Zu Ti outwardly ignored Shi Le, but secretly allowed the people to trade. As a result, Zu Ti had well-trained soldiers and sufficient supplies. When he had the opportunity, he would cross the Yellow River to recover the lost territories of northern China.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, at this time, Emperor Yuan sent Dai Yuan as Inspector-General to divide Zu Ti's military power. In the court, Wang Dun and Liu Wei were fighting for power, and an internal conflict was likely to break out. Zu Ti knew that once an internal conflict broke out, he would not be able to cross the Yellow River again to recover the lost territories, so he became depressed and fell seriously ill. As he was dying, Zu Ti lamented, "I have not completely recovered the lost territories before dying. I will not rest in peace even in death!"</p>
<p>He died in Chengdu in August of the twenty-fifth year.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Archimedes (287-212 B.C.) <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— Yao Hua</p>
<p>Archimedes was a famous Greek physicist and geometer. He was born in Syracuse, a city on the island of Sicily. When he was born, the glorious era of Syracuse had already passed, and throughout his life, there were constant wars. Initially, King Pyrrhus of Epirus helped Syracuse fight the Carthaginians. Later, Pyrrhus, due to the jealousy and conspiracies of his allies, angrily led his troops back to his country. At that time, Archimedes was only eleven years old, and he had already entered school in Alexandria.</p>
<p>We are not very familiar with Archimedes' life in his youth, but we know that he had a serious and calm mind and spent many years in academic research, which enabled him to achieve his later accomplishments.</p>
<p>He had relations with the Syracuse royal family. He once said a famous bold statement to King Hiero, saying that if he were given a place to stand, he could move the Earth. But Hiero did not believe him. It just so happened that King Hiero was building a ship for King Ptolemy, but after its completion, no one in the entire city of Syracuse could figure out how to launch the ship. Archimedes then agreed to take on this task. He then came up with the organization of pulleys, which could use very little force to push a very large weight. After he arranged the pulleys, he handed one end of the rope to Hiero to pull. The ship, which could not be moved, was easily launched into the water by Hiero pulling the rope.</p>
<p>This success made the king trust him very much. Then came the second problem. King Hiero had commissioned a pure gold crown and wanted to know if the craftsman had mixed other metals into it, so he asked Archimedes to check it. The crown could not be broken, and visual observation was useless. Archimedes thought for a long time but could not solve the problem, so he had to reply to the king that there was no way. But he was always a competitive person, and he was very disappointed that this matter was unsuccessful. On his way back, he was very bored and listlessly ran to the public bathhouse to take a bath. When he jumped into the water, the water in the tub overflowed, and he noticed that the more he sank, the lighter his body seemed to feel. The clever Archimedes saw this phenomenon and was overjoyed. He jumped out of the tub and ran into the street, shouting, "I've got it! I've got it!" Because he had realized the famous law of buoyancy.</p>
<p>Archimedes, because he had a clear mind and was willing to think carefully, quickly deduced a conclusion from this phenomenon. Ordinary people, although they also saw the water overflowing from the tub when bathing and felt that their body seemed lighter, did not find the reason because they were too lazy to think and investigate.</p>
<p>Archimedes' law of buoyancy states that the buoyant force experienced by an object in water must be equal to the weight of the water displaced by the same volume. From this, the density or specific gravity of an object can be determined. Archimedes found that the specific gravity of the crown was lighter than the specific gravity of pure gold, so he concluded that the craftsman had mixed other metals into it.</p>
<p>A few years later, Archimedes grew old, and King Hiero died. He was succeeded by Hieronymus, the young king, who allied with Carthage, the sworn enemy, against Rome. As a result, the Roman navy blockaded the port of Syracuse, and General Marcellus led a large army to besiege the city of Syracuse.</p>
<p>Although Archimedes did not agree with the alliance with Carthage, when the country was in danger, he abandoned his personal views and used his intelligence and talent to come up with various defensive tools to protect his compatriots.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, Archimedes invented the organization of pulleys, which could use very little force to move a very large weight. Later, he invented the crane. Although this crane cannot be compared with modern cranes, more than two thousand years ago, Archimedes used it to lift Roman warships, suspend them in the air, and then drop them, colliding them with the water surface, smashing the Roman warships to pieces. Sometimes he lifted the ships into the city and lowered them to allow the people of Syracuse to capture these Roman soldiers alive.</p>
<p>He also invented the catapult, which could shoot large stones to attack Roman warships. He also invented a device that could shoot small stones and broken pieces of copper and iron to attack the enemy.</p>
<p>These inventions were powerful tools to help the people of Syracuse defend their country. The Roman army was terrified when they saw a rope thrown out of the city, fearing that the old scientist would come up with new ways to deal with them. Marcellus knew that morale was low and that the siege would not be effective, so he abandoned the attack on the city and adopted a blockade method, cutting off the food supply. In this way, Syracuse finally surrendered in 212 BC. Two years later, Rome ruled the entire island of Sicily.</p>
<p>When the city of Syracuse fell, the old scientist was buried in research, trying to save his compatriots through scientific inventions.</p>
<p>Although Marcellus suffered at the hands of Archimedes, he admired his talent very much. Therefore, on the day the city fell, he ordered his subordinates not to harm the old scientist. But he was not a person who was greedy for life and afraid of death. He had long been determined to die for his country. So when a soldier broke into his house, he unceremoniously shouted, "Get out, you fool, don't destroy my circles!" He deliberately angered the soldier and used the enemy's sword to end his own life.</p>
<p>Archimedes made significant contributions to geometry, hydrostatics, and mechanics throughout his life. In terms of his achievements, he is immortal even in death.</p>
<p>In geometry, he determined the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter and the area of a circle. Although Epollonius also determined the value of pi (i.e., the ratio of the circumference to the diameter) at the same time, which was more accurate than Archimedes' determination, he stumped Epollonius with the famous "Cattle Problem." It is said that the answer to this problem was written in a book of more than six hundred pages.</p>
<p>In hydrostatics, he discovered the law of buoyancy and deduced other laws of hydrostatics from it, laying the foundation for hydrostatics. His two books on "Floating Bodies" are the bible for researchers of hydrostatics.</p>
<p>In mechanics, his contributions were also significant. He discovered the law of levers and manufactured pulleys and primitive cranes. These have a very close relationship with the daily lives of modern people! His basic theories of mechanics have not made any progress in more than two thousand years. It can be said that we are still in his world today.</p>

<h3 id="e135">Introduction to "The Essence of National High School and Junior High School Compositions" <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Hanmei</p>
<p>Writing is an important tool for recording events, expressing emotions, and conveying meanings. It is indispensable for both studying and managing affairs. Literature can cultivate the mind and exercise thinking, nurturing morality and serving as an important course in youth training, occupying a primary position in educational value. Observing history, the rise and fall, order and chaos of dynasties are often fully expressed in literature. We dare not say that literature can determine order and chaos, but at least it can express the spiritual trends of a certain era.</p>
<p>However, the scope of literature is very broad. Even with the Chinese language subject in middle schools, selecting materials for teaching is more difficult than other subjects. In terms of guiding extracurricular assignments, it is even more difficult to find an appropriate method. How to choose books of Chinese studies to cultivate a foundation in writing, how to emphasize composition methods and styles to train the ability of appreciation and discrimination of general scholars, how to cultivate the ability to express oneself, and how to guide scholars' writing, all these are major issues that Chinese language teachers have pondered for thousands of years, and have not yet been resolved. These points seem to focus too much on specialized issues in Chinese language teaching. Now, let's focus on the "observation" aspect. Observation is the most effective method in Chinese language teaching. Often, when a teacher presents a good work by a student to other students for viewing, the students' attention, research, and criticism are probably more serious than reading Chinese language teaching materials. If that article is published in a newspaper or magazine, the admiration and appreciation of the students will be even greater. And the student who wrote this article will be overjoyed and consider it a special honor. This situation, from childhood to old age, remains the same, regardless of ancient times, modern times, China, or foreign countries. However, the environment is changing, and the desire for pursuit is increasing. Therefore, in the Chinese language subject in elementary and middle schools, if teachers make full use of this observation method, the author believes that students' writing performance will definitely improve rapidly, and it can increase unlimited interest!</p>
<p>Here, we should pay attention to this "observation" method. If it is limited to one grade or one school, then the world is too small, and the scope is too narrow, and we cannot achieve our ideal effect. If we can collect the writing performance of students from middle schools across the country in one volume, then the students' observation materials will be rich, and the interest in observation will increase tenfold, and the benefits will be far greater than one grade or one school.</p>
<p>Mr. Ma Chonggan, in addition to politics and lecturing, suddenly made a grand vow to promote the advancement of middle school students throughout China. He invited famous scholars to carefully evaluate the writing performance of students from middle schools across the country. There were strict standards for subject matter, style, rhetoric, and composition, with careful selection and omission. He spent more than a year of hard work to compile this book, "The Essence of National High School and Junior High School Compositions." After browsing through it, the author deeply sighed at the hard work of the book's editor and the greatness of his contribution, and the deep benefits for middle school students across the country. And the Chinese language teachers of general middle schools will also find it very convenient.</p>
<p>The book is divided into two parts, one is "The Essence of National Junior High School Compositions," with four thick volumes; the other is "The Essence of National High School Compositions," with four thick volumes. These two parts of high school and junior high school composition essence include 1,274 articles, from 264 schools. It is impossible to collect all the writing performance of middle schools across the country, but it can already represent the writing performance of middle school students. Among them are narrative essays, explanatory essays, argumentative essays, book reviews, descriptive essays, biographical essays, applied essays, speeches, birthday essays, farewell essays, elegies, novels, poems, and plays, encompassing everything, and because of the careful selection, the abundance of masterpieces, there is no need to elaborate.</p>
<p>The author hereby introduces these two books to the Chinese language teachers and middle school students of middle schools across the country, hoping that each middle school student will have a copy and read it carefully. You should know that the ability to make good use of writing tools is the key to one's professional achievements in life; for the country, it is the key to the rise and fall of a generation's culture, and it is absolutely not to be ignored.</p>
<p>Friendly people in neighboring countries are saying: "Two hundred years later, the pronunciation and meaning of Chinese characters will need to be taught by them." We don't need to be angry that these words are too arrogant. In short, the fact that not every Chinese person is willing to study their own characters carefully and diligently is a painful fact that cannot be denied. "Why come? Just remember!"</p>
<p>"The Essence of Junior High School Compositions" has four thick volumes, each costing two yuan and two jiao, each volume costing five jiao and five fen; "The Essence of High School Compositions" has four thick volumes, and the selling price is the same as "The Essence of Junior High School Compositions."

<p>Extracurricular activities are regarded by many modern educators as equally important as in-class work. Deam and Bear of the United States once said: "Extracurricular activities supplement and extend the experiences children gain in regular classes. They give proper outlets for children's surplus energy, natural tendencies of boys and girls, and self-respect; at the same time, they discover their ordinary and special abilities. The establishment of education is not to create energy, but to discharge and guide it. Extracurricular activities help develop the nature of young people, allowing these natural abilities to be fully expressed. Furthermore, extracurricular activities channel students' energy in beneficial directions, enabling them to receive good civic training." From this passage, we can understand the importance of extracurricular activities.</p>
<p>In the past, Chinese education generally regarded the purpose of education purely as the infusion of knowledge and the cultivation of morality. Therefore, the reading life of scholars was one of "ten years of cold window," without stepping into gardens or peeking through doors, spending all day reading books, even day and night, with no leisure. Those running schools only strictly supervised leisure education, not allowing the slightest bit of freedom. Chinese history clearly tells us that from the beginning of recorded history until the late Qing dynasty, the Chinese school administrative system never paid attention to extracurricular activities, let alone dreamed of them.</p>
<p>The history of extracurricular activities in our country is very short from beginning to end. Although the development is rapid, it is still immature. Although it has broken away from the budding stage, it is still a tender sapling in the garden; it relies on sound organization as its roots, precise administration as its soil, appropriate guidance and management as its rich and inexhaustible fertilizer, and all the visitors to the garden as its charitable protectors. We must constantly cut grass, constantly irrigate, let it grow, and when the time comes, it will naturally bear bright buds, beautiful flowers, and fragrant and unparalleled fruits.</p>
<p>How can "extracurricular activities" gradually develop? That, of course, requires educators to study. Regarding works on the study of extracurricular activities, there are only scattered articles in newspapers and magazines; systematic writings are still not many.

<h3 id="e137">The Doubting Antiquity School and the Social History School (Continued) <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Fu</p>
<p>In the conclusion, Gu stated that he praised the lively attitude of the social history school. I do not participate in the social history debate because of insufficient ability, but only take the review of materials as my own work. I offer this paper specifically to the social history school, but I hope that the propaganda documents of the pre-Qin philosophers should not be used as historical materials of ancient society, and attention should be paid to the danger of building pavilions on the sand. ...</p>
<p>Although Gu released an arrow at the social history school, it was well-intentioned and still relied on the social history school. However, Yang Tongkui, who was mentioned in the postscript of this paper regarding the Yu Gong Society, clearly held disbelief towards the social history school and mixed in people who clung to the old theories of the social history school. This is a sign of separation between the Doubting Antiquity School and a part of the Social History School.</p>
<p>Is the Doubting Antiquity School aimlessly ending with doubting antiquity, wanting to separate from the Social History School and become isolated?</p>
<p>And should the social historians who are enthusiastic about the formal theory reflect and be more active on a solid foundation?</p>
<p>If the Social History School and the Doubting Antiquity School break the common front, this is a great misfortune for the Chinese academic community. However, I believe that mutual discussion and mutual dispute in academics is a phenomenon that should exist, and I always feel that the re-identification of the old is extremely important. It should also be divided research towards the same goal, which is originally not impossible! (End)</p>

<h3 id="e140">Autumn Fishing Season Has Arrived Three Banks Raise Funds to Lend to Fishermen Totaling 120,000 Yuan Eight Loan Measures <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The Four Banks Savings Society, Zhonghui Bank, and Xinhua Bank have raised 120,000 yuan to lend to fishermen first, as the autumn fishing season has arrived and fishermen are in urgent need of funds. The loan measures and progress are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Three Banks Raise Funds</p>
<p>The preparation of the Fishery Syndicate has been nearly half a year. Although the Ministry of Industry has formulated an organizational outline and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for approval, all detailed measures have been drafted by Qian Xinzhi, Kui Yanfang, and Wang Zhixin, and have been submitted to the ministry for instructions. After receiving the letter, they can start drafting. However, the autumn fishing season is about to end. Fishing boats going to sea have always been advanced by fish companies. This year, due to the impact of the economic downturn, fishing boats have no way to borrow money and lack funds to go to sea. The Fish Market was requested and agreed to by the Four Banks Savings Society, Zhonghui, and Xinhua Banks to raise 120,000 yuan first. Xinhua Bank was entrusted to handle the loan, and 50,000 yuan has been lent to the Ningbo Fishermen's Cooperative to re-lend to the fishermen. The remaining 70,000 yuan will be lent to the fishing boats. Applications were made to the syndicate by the unloaders of the Fish Market and closed on the 20th. After review, loans can be started within days.</p>
<p>Loan Measures</p>
<p>There are eight articles recorded later: (1) The Four Banks Savings Society, Zhonghui Bank, and Xinhua Bank (hereinafter referred to as the Three Banks) are organizing ship industry loans for the 25th year of the autumn fishing season to meet the urgent needs of fishermen. (2) The purpose of the loan referred to in these measures is to lend to fishermen or ice-fresh boat merchants for a portion of the expenses required for this year's voyage. (3) The loan referred to in these measures is temporarily aimed at fishery cooperatives and unloaders in the Shanghai Fish Market and is temporarily limited to those related to the Shanghai Fish Market. (4) Those who apply for a loan in accordance with these measures must have the Shanghai Fish Market as a guarantor. When the Three Banks deem it necessary, they may also order the borrower to add individuals or groups recognized by the Three Banks as guarantors. The guarantor and the borrower jointly bear all the responsibilities for the repayment of the loan. (5) Those who apply for a loan in accordance with these measures take the payment that should be obtained from the sale of fish in the Shanghai Fish Market or the commission that should be obtained from the consignment as collateral. When the Three Banks recognize that the payment commission is insufficient as collateral, they may order the borrower to provide other collateral. (6) The loan period shall not exceed ten months, but it can be repaid in installments, and the interest decreases with the principal. (7) The loan interest rate is calculated at 9% per month and is settled monthly. The loan interest rate for fishery cooperatives may be reduced by 1%. (8) The interest rate for the unloaders of the Fish Market to re-lend to the swimming fresh boats shall not be higher than 3% above the loan interest rate of the Three Banks.</p>

<h3 id="e145">Flour and Wheat Prices Soared Yesterday The Market Added Restrictions on Transactions Temporarily Suspended Forecast: The Rising Trend is Difficult to Stop for a While <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency said that yesterday, the flour and wheat market experienced an even stronger surge. Flour rose by a dime in one day, causing several later sessions to be suspended. Wheat was still flat in the morning, but in the afternoon, due to the sharp rise in flour prices, it also rose by two dimes. The exchange authorities are now trying to find a way to temporarily stabilize the situation, but it is predicted that the rising trend will be difficult to stop in the future. The details of yesterday are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Soaring Prices Special Restrictions</p>
<p>The rising trend in the flour market has been fierce for days, with a tendency to soar. Yesterday's rise was even greater. After the market opened in the morning, the buying sentiment was very strong, and the demand was huge. Therefore, the prices of all months rose in unison in half a day, reaching as high as seven or eight points. When the market opened in the afternoon, the rising trend did not decrease. The exchange authorities then imposed restrictions based on the "daily price increase shall not exceed one dime" rule. As a result, all months rose by one dime. The highest price for the distant period was three yuan, nine dimes, zero li, two and a half hao, and the highest price for the near period was three yuan, seven dimes, four fen, two li, and a half hao. Since the exchange authorities imposed restrictions on prices, transactions have been virtually suspended.</p>
<p>Wheat Affected Prices Also Rise</p>
<p>Wheat in yesterday's miscellaneous grain market did not fluctuate much when the market opened in the morning. The prices of each month rose by six or seven points. By the most recent sessions in the afternoon, wheat prices also rose sharply due to the high rise in flour prices. Spot and bid prices both rose to six yuan, and distant-period wheat rose to six yuan and six dimes. The near period rose by two dimes compared to the previous periods, and the distant period rose by two dimes, five fen, and six li.</p>
<p>The Market Plans to Seek Stable Solutions</p>
<p>Regarding the sudden rise in flour and wheat prices, the exchange is now looking for stable solutions. For flour, the margin has been increased from 250 yuan to 500 yuan, and it is now planned to increase it to 750 yuan to prevent speculators from manipulating the market. For wheat, the margin will be collected today. If the margin cannot be collected, it may also be suspended from auction.</p>
<p>Insiders Talk About the Reasons for the Sudden Rise</p>
<p>According to inquiries from flour and wheat merchants, the reason for the sudden rise was initially that a certain party bought a large amount of domestic flour. The number of shipments from Shanghai to North China and Northeast China was very large. Although flour mills are working overtime, they cannot meet the demand. Although a certain party has recently stopped buying, there is actually no goods that can be supplied. However, according to this year's domestic wheat production, although it is better than in previous years, in fact, domestic manufacturers have often sought supplies from foreign countries in the past. This year, foreign wheat production is not abundant, and the import of foreign wheat has decreased. Therefore, although manufacturers bought domestic wheat when it was newly produced, the inventory can only supply four or five months. The next new wheat harvest is still nine months away. Therefore, raw materials will be scarce in these four or five months. If we observe the current situation, the future of flour prices is still rising. Moreover, speculators often spread rumors in the market these days, which is also one of the reasons for the rise.</p>

<p>Shen Shi News Agency reports that the Ministry of Railways completed the 6% British Loan for the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway in the amount of 1.1 million pounds in the 25th year of the Republic (1936). The loan was underwritten by a syndicate composed of the China-British Banking Corporation and the China Construction Bank. The Ministry of Railways organized a certain Gold Management Committee to issue bonds. On the first of this month, advance subscription certificates were issued first. The official bonds were printed by the Shanghai Commercial Press. The bonds have now been printed, and all who hold advance subscription certificates can exchange them for official bonds at the HSBC at No. 12 Bund starting today. A notice has been issued. As for the insufficient funds for the construction of the Yuehan Railway, it was previously requested that the board of directors in charge of the British Boxer Indemnity Fund transfer the funds earmarked for purchasing materials for the Jinpu and Jiaoji Railways and the funds earmarked for purchasing vehicles for the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, as well as the second batch of materials for the Capital Ferry. The remaining amount of the British Boxer Indemnity Fund to be returned from the 26th year of the Republic (1937) onwards was used as collateral. Now, as it is still deemed insufficient, another 3 million yuan has been borrowed from the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. The two banks will bear the burden equally. The funds will be delivered in installments from this month onwards. Both parties have signed a contract, and the funds for this month have already been delivered by the two banks to the Ministry of Railways for distribution to the Yuehan Railway Bureau.</p>

<p>The Jixi Fellow Villagers Association in this city, due to the rampant banditry in Anhui Province, has sent telegrams to various parties requesting strict suppression. The following reply telegrams have been received in succession: (1) Chairman Liu of the Anhui Provincial Government telegraphed, "Your telegram received.

<h3 id="e172">Tuberculosis Screening: Last Month's Statistical Report Shows a Total of 817 People Screened, with Only 246 Completely Healthy <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>The tuberculosis H-ray group screening jointly initiated by the Chinese Anti-Tuberculosis Association and Hongqiao Sanatorium has seen an increase in the number of people screened each month since its inception. According to statistics from last month, from September 11th to October 11th, the total number of people screened was 817, including 626 males and 191 females. In terms of occupation, 339 were from the business community, 233 from the academic community, 36 from the industrial community, 92 from other fields, and 117 were unemployed. The screening results showed that 246 people were completely healthy. Ninety-eight people suffered from active pulmonary tuberculosis, accounting for 13.3% of the total. A total of 413 people were found to have chronic pulmonary tuberculosis, accounting for 50.5% of the total. Sixty people had heart or aortic changes, accounting for 7.3% of the total. According to this, the total number of chronic and active pulmonary tuberculosis cases alone exceeds 60% of the total, which is alarming. Based on Shanghai's population of 3 million, if we extrapolate accordingly, the number of people infected with tuberculosis could reach over 1.5 million. The severity of the disaster is unimaginable. The Xuhui screening center is still located at No. 2 Daxilu, south of Jing'an Temple, with extremely convenient transportation. To facilitate screening for all sectors, it has now been changed to be held every Wednesday morning. Screening certificates can still be purchased from the Shen Bao newspaper office in advance for one yuan per person. Attend at the scheduled time to avoid long waits and crowding.</p>

<p>The Yangtze River water level usually recedes in November, but this year, due to the small amount of water in the Sichuan River, the water level in the Yangtze River has also decreased rapidly. Near Jiujiang and above, there are only 21 or 22 feet, and Wuhu only has 17 to 18 feet. In particular, the Qingtianjiao channel in Tongzhou has undergone drastic changes. Yesterday, Huang Youshi, captain of the China Merchants Bureau's Jiangxin Wheel, telegraphed Shanghai, reporting the situation, saying, "This afternoon, this wheel passed the Qingtianjiao buoy. The channel only has 14 feet of ice. The last time this wheel passed this place, it was also during low tide, but there were still 19 feet of water. It can be seen that the channel has undergone rapid changes. Please quickly notify the hydrographic survey, the Customs Port Patrol Department, and all wheels of this bureau to pay special attention when passing through this channel." After receiving this telegram, the bureau, in addition to notifying the captains of all Yangtze River ships, has forwarded it to the Customs and Measurement Bureau to inform all shipping merchants, so as to avoid unexpected dangers for the ships.</p>

<p>Liu Huai, captain of the anti-smuggling team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, reported on the 16th that Xue Shilin, the squad leader, had received confidential information that someone was setting up an organization in the Zhaojiabang Road area of Nanshi to secretly counterfeit British-American "Bandit" brand cigarettes for sale in the market, hoping to profit from them. He immediately dispatched squad leader Xue and team leaders Liu Bingyuan and Wang Peiting, along with debt investigators, to the Changsheng Hotel opposite the Guandi Temple on Zhaojiabang Road. Guided by the original informant, they arrested Liu Fulin on the spot. He admitted to selling cigarettes outside. Counterfeit cigarette empty cases were found on Liu. After determining the source of these counterfeit cigarette empty cases, the officers went to the Xueji Printing House on Wuhua Road in Zhabei for a raid. They seized a wooden box of cigarette case paper, containing 5,000 sheets, and detained Tang Zongfang, the shop owner. They then went to the third floor of No. 37 Yuanjili, Tangshan Road, Hongkou, and seized four boxes of counterfeit case paper, totaling 20,000 sheets. According to Tang Zongfang, he had partners who specialized in distributing counterfeit cigarettes at Room 15 of the Tongyu Hotel on the 16th Pu in Nanshi. They secretly went to Room 15 of the hotel and arrested Wang Zaide and seized three large boxes of counterfeit cigarettes, totaling 1,500 cigarettes, and many sheets of empty case paper. Wang Zaide confessed that the counterfeit empty cases were entrusted to him by Xu Zhengyuan, who lived at the entrance of Aisi Lane, Qimei Road, Zhabei. The officers rushed to the above-mentioned location and arrested Xu Zhengyuan. Xu pointed out that the empty cases were sold by Jin Zhenyu from Ningbo. As for where the counterfeiting organization was located, he did not know. Until the night before last, the officers secretly went to No. 1 Lianquanfang, Tangshan Road, and arrested Yu Zhenyu. A total of five suspects were arrested, and more than 30,000 sheets of empty case paper were seized. The team interrogated the suspects several times. Jin Zhenyu finally confessed that all the counterfeit cigarettes and empty cases were purchased from a wholesale outlet at No. 769 Faelun Road in the Public Concession. The officers, disguised, went to inquire with Chinese and Western detectives from the police station in charge. They learned that the counterfeiting organization was located at No. 40 Dexin Lane behind Faelun Road. The Chinese and Western detectives entered the house and broke up a huge counterfeiting organization. They captured the resident manager, Gu Yisheng, foreman Li Yuankang, Cao Xianbao, and a certain Japanese, Ikura Ken. Except for Ikura Ken, who was taken away by personnel from the consulate in charge for his own disposal, the other three suspects were transferred to the team. According to their confessions, the person in charge of the organization was actually Jing Huixian and others. All the suspects and evidence have been sent to the bureau for interrogation. The machines seized in the organization have been sealed by the police station for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Three People Jump into the River, Fortunately All Were Rescued; One Grieved Over National Affairs <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Between the night before last and yesterday morning, three men jumped into the river to commit suicide. The reasons for their despondency were: one could not bear the pain of illness, one was under economic pressure, and one claimed to be grieving over national affairs. The details of each case are as follows:</p>
<p>Fang Baoyuan, 32 years old, from Ningbo, at 5:10 pm the night before last, took the Chunbei Qianshi ferry at the Peidong Chunjiang Pier to cross the river. When the boat reached the center of the river, he suddenly jumped into the river from the side of the boat. His body was floating up and down. Fortunately, he was rescued by the captain of the boat, who stopped the engine and devised a method of rescue. He was sent to the Customs Water Police Station. He claimed that he was suffering from severe heart pain and that there was no joy in life, so he had the idea of ending his life. The chief police officer immediately sent detective Yao Guofa to Renji Hospital for treatment. Because Fang claimed to have been treated at the Edouard Road Epidemic Hospital, he was sent to the Epidemic Hospital for treatment after being informed by the doctor at Renji Hospital.</p>
<p>Lu Haisheng, 27 years old, from Jingjiang, at 9:10 pm the night before last, stood alone on the Waibaidu Bridge outside the mouth of the Suzhou Creek. Taking advantage of no one's attention, he climbed over the railing and jumped into the river to commit suicide. With a loud splash, waves splashed everywhere. A Chinese police officer from the distant Water Police Station noticed and rushed to rescue Lu. He was taken back to the police station. He confessed that he was a tailor. Because there was no future in his hometown, he admired the prosperity of Shanghai and the ease of making money. Half a month ago, he raised some travel expenses to come to Shanghai and stayed with his friend Chen A'da, who set up a stall on Marong Road in the French Concession. However, after arriving in Shanghai, he could not find a place to eat. His travel expenses were used up, and all hope was lost. He sought death to avoid becoming a starving ghost. The chief police officer, feeling extremely sorry for him, sent detective Xu Lenian to send him to his friend Chen's home to find a way to help him or send him back to his hometown.</p>
<p>Zhuang Binrong, 24 years old, from Hangzhou, jumped into the river at the Zhaofeng Road Pier in Hongkou at 9:00 am yesterday. Fortunately, he was discovered and rescued by a Chinese police officer from the Customs Water Police Station and taken back to the police station. He confessed that he used to work at the Wuhua Silk Weaving Factory and is currently unemployed. He has an older brother named A'bin in Shanghai, who lives in Juxing Lane, Wuhua Road, and runs a teahouse. He was grieved that the country was being oppressed by strong neighbors. He read the newspapers every day and was deeply stimulated. He had a pessimistic view and hoped to die to get rid of his troubles. The chief police officer ordered a detective to summon his brother and take him back to comfort him.</p>

<h3 id="e180">After Bending Down to Pick Up an Apple, a Young Girl Experiences Danger; The Plot is Like a Mythological Novel; The Court Will Conduct a Detailed Investigation <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Wang Dingtai from Tianjin, who lives at No. 4 Yixing Lane, Guoqing Road, Zhabei, has a daughter named Wang Xiuzhen, 17 years old, who is quite beautiful. On the afternoon of August 16th, she was walking along Guandong Datong Road when she saw two apples on the ground. She bent down to pick them up. An old woman from Suzhou, Wang Hua, stroked the girl's head, and the girl fell into a coma. She was taken to Wang Li's house in Gaoshou Lane, Haining Road, for a night's sleep. She was sweating all over. She woke up in the morning and thanked Ms. Wang for saving her from heatstroke. She asked to be sent home. Ms. Wang hired a car to send her off. Unexpectedly, she became delirious again in the car. She was sent to the Oriental Hotel and raped by a man for two nights. Ms. Wang told the girl that her brother had sold her to him. The girl cried and wanted to see her mother. Ms. Wang took her to the China Hotel at the North Railway Station. Because the girl was crying non-stop, the waiter intervened. Ms. Wang left. A police officer saw her as suspicious and detained her at the Laochan Police Station. The girl explained the situation. The police station thought that the case involved magic, so they arrested Wang Li. Because the incident took place in the Chinese area, they transferred her to the Public Security Bureau and sent her to the Local Court. The prosecutor investigated. In addition to returning the girl to her family, the old woman was also prosecuted. Yesterday, Judge Shao Qinzhi opened the court. The girl confessed the previous situation and said that there were many people watching her in the China Bookstore. The defendant claimed that the girl was her daughter-in-law and that everything she said was completely fabricated. At this point, the victim's lawyer, Tang Hao, appeared in court and filed a civil lawsuit for mental damages of only one yuan. At this point, the official questioned the hotel waiter again. The waiter said that Wang Hua and the girl had been to the Oriental Hotel, but only two people came in and left in the middle of the night, and there was no third person. The official thought that the case needed to be investigated and would be heard again.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Failure to Recommend a Job Leads to Murder; Wu Guangen's Intentions are Sinister; Fang Boxi's Life Ends Tragically <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Fang Boxi, 24 years old, from Nanhui, was a noodle maker at the Wuweizhai Noodle Shop at No. 9 Minzhuniyin Road in the French Concession. He stayed overnight in the cooking area at No. 12 Xinshou'an Lane, across the street. Because his fellow villager and colleague, Wu Guangen (the same age as Fang), failed to recommend a job to him, Wu harbored resentment and intended to kill Fang. On the night of the 2nd of this month, Wu secretly hid a foot-fighting knife and borrowed a place to stay at Fang's place. At about 5:00 am the next morning, while Fang was sleeping soundly, Wu stabbed Fang's throat with the knife. Fang woke up in pain and chased him out. The police intercepted Wu and took him to the police station. Fang died of excessive blood loss after ineffective treatment. After the body was reported and examined by the court, the police sent Wu to the Special No. 2 Court for interrogation and detention. The Police Department's lawyer prosecuted him for murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday, Wang Gangxu, the chief of the criminal court of the Special No. 2 Court, and Wang Ren, the prosecutor, came to the second criminal court for a continued trial. Fang Wei, the mother of the deceased, said that her husband had died early and she had raised Boxi. She relied on him for support. Now that he had been killed by Wu, her livelihood was cut off and she requested that the defendant be severely punished. Wu Guangen confessed that he killed him because the deceased did not recommend a job to him, so he was angry and killed him. The court also summoned witnesses Wang Shuyuan and Zhu Fusheng. According to them, the defendant's behavior was usually good, and they did not know why he killed Fang this time. They had never heard him say that he had a feud with Fang. Hua B was summoned from No. 156 and No. 459 to testify about the process of arresting the defendant. At this point, the court considered that the case was clear and ordered the opening of arguments. Yuan Jiahong, the Police Department's lawyer, and the lawyer appointed by the court to defend the defendant made their arguments. The court ordered the debate to be concluded and set the sentence for the 28th. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Settlement of Dispute over Broken Engagement: Zheng Sues Bao, Case Set for Pronouncement; Bao Sues Zheng, Case Dismissed for Lack of Jurisdiction <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Zheng Jinghan, the second daughter of Zheng Liansheng, a Suzhou native and owner of the Peimei Flower Shop on Nanjing Road, became engaged in October of last year to Bao Wenhai, the son of Bao Maoji, a Ningbo native and former comprador of the Ruheng Foreign Firm, who is now the secretary of the National Commercial College. Recently, due to differences of opinion, the woman initiated the dissolution of the engagement. Following negotiations, the woman, in addition to returning the engagement gift of four hundred yuan, also compensated the man for his losses in the amount of three hundred yuan. Consequently, on the 28th of last month, both parties went to the office of lawyer Wang Weizhen on the fifth floor of the Continental Emporium on Nanjing Road to sign the agreement. Unexpectedly, Bao Wenhai brought two portraits of Zheng Jinghan, and the Zheng party insisted on their immediate return, leading to a conflict and physical altercation. Both parties had filed complaints of assault with the General Inspectorate, but neither was accepted. Zheng Liansheng then hired lawyer Yin Shijie to sue Bao Maoji and Bao Wenhai for assault in the Special District Court No. 1. The Bao family, father and son, also sued Zheng Liansheng, his wife Zhao, his son Yangyuan, and his daughter Jinghan for assault in the Special District Court No. 1. Zheng's case against Bao had already been heard once by the Special District Court No. 1, while Bao's case against Zheng was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yi Shengchao of the Special District Court held another hearing in the fifth courtroom. Zheng Liansheng was absent due to illness and was represented by lawyer Yin. The Bao family, father and son, filed a counterclaim against Zheng Liansheng for assault. During questioning, Bao Wenhai testified that on the day of the signing at lawyer Wang's office, due to the issue of the two photographs, Zheng Yangyuan uttered abusive language and insulted him. He returned the insults. Unexpectedly, Zheng's alleged relatives and two unknown persons rushed out, beat him, causing injuries and tearing his clothes. He then went to the police station to file a report, and so on. The court also cross-examined Bao Maoji. Then, the judge ordered the start of the debate. After arguments between Lawyer Gu and the defendant's lawyer Shi Zhuoren, Judge Ye announced the conclusion of the debate and scheduled the verdict for the afternoon of the 28th.</p>

<h3 id="e184">Fraud for Four Years, Hundreds of Cases, Embezzling Ten Thousand Yuan, All Under the Guise of Hospitals: Police Investigation Completed, Prosecution Initiated <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Chinese detective Wu Hanzhang of the Putuo Road Police Station No. 50, on the 1st of this month, at the intersection of Huaqing Road and Henan Road, No. 24 Tong'an Lane on Xinzha Road, and No. 59 North Wuxi Road, arrested six individuals: young women Yang Ying, Sun Suzhen, and Sun Cuilan, and men Zhang Xuexiang, Sun Laisheng, and Chen Guantai (also known as Chen Afu or Dou Luan Afu), who were fraudulently soliciting donations from all walks of life under the names of the Guangji Charity Hospital and the Civilian Women and Children Hospital. Along with</p>
<p>Donation Books, Receipts,</p>
<p>etc., they were brought to the First Special District Court for interrogation. Because the defendants were part of a large-scale organized fraud scheme, committing numerous crimes within the concession since 1933, an immediate investigation was impossible. Therefore, it was ordered that they be detained pending further investigation. These details have already been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the police investigation procedures in this case have been completed. The number of cases of fraudulent fundraising committed by the defendants in the concession during these four years is no less than hundreds. The donations obtained,</p>
<p>amount to approximately ten thousand yuan. A secret organization was established, specializing in utilizing young women like Yang Ying, employing their eloquent tongues and disguising them as female students, carrying handbags and donation books, soliciting donations everywhere. The police have now obtained eighteen types of evidence, including: (1) An anonymous letter received by the Gordon Road Police Station on June 6th, enclosing a pamphlet for the Civilian Women and Children Charity Clinic; (2) An</p>
<p>Envelope and Flyer</p>
<p>obtained by Detective No. 50 at Chengshun Porcelain Store, 689 Xihua Road, on September 21st; (3) Thirty-nine envelopes and flyers confiscated when the defendant Yang Xuexiang was arrested, all bearing the words "Guangji Charity Hospital, 1042 Huishan Road, Hongkou"; (4) A ledger from the Guangji Hospital; (5) A receipt book; (6) (7) Two bankbooks; (8) Sixteen cards from the Guangji Hospital; (9) Nineteen business cards of Yang Yunqin (i.e., Yang Ying), an external staff member of Guangji; (10) Two business cards of Hu Weimin, the director of Guangji Hospital; (11) Stamps and receipts</p>
<p>from seventy businesses for donations collected by Yang Ying for Guangji, totaling two sheets; (12) An anonymous letter sent to Judge Fu Lin of the First Special District Court; (13) An anonymous letter sent to the General Inspectorate; (14) A card and receipt from the Civilian Women and Children Clinic, and a receipt from the Guangji Hospital; (15) A receipt from the Women and Children Hospital to Weier Heji Yarn Factory; (16) A card from the Civilian Women and Children Hospital received by the Central Trust Bureau on Hankou Road; (17)</p>
<p>A business card of Xie Weiliang (who can identify the defendant Sun Cuilan) of the General Affairs Department of the Bank of China</p>
<p>on Hankou Road (18) A business card of Xie Kesheng (who can identify Sun Guantai) of the China &amp; South Sea Bank on Hankou Road. These were listed and, along with the defendants, were brought to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang, in accordance with Article 340 of the Criminal Code, charged the defendants with habitual fraud and detailed the case, stating that the first defendant, Yang Ying, admitted to undertaking</p>
<p>fundraising work</p>
<p>since 1933. In 1933, in her hometown of Jiading, she met the defendant Sun Cuilan and came to Shanghai with her, residing with the defendant Chen Guantai. Chen then conceived the idea of ​​fundraising under false pretenses. He accompanied Yang and Sun to Hong Kong, falsely claiming to be from the Shanghai Women's Charity Hospital on Lan Weiai Road in the French Concession, and solicited 2,000 yuan in donations, with Chen paying Yang Ying a monthly transportation fee of 10 yuan. After returning to Shanghai, they again used the names of</p>
<p>the Civilian Women and Children's Hospital</p>
<p>and the Fulu Hospital to solicit donations everywhere, and Yang's monthly salary also increased to 15 yuan. Later, Yang suddenly had a disagreement with Chen Guantai and returned to her hometown last year. In April of this year, she came to Shanghai again, residing at 149 Guling Road. In June, Hu Fengmin, who claimed to be the director of the Guangji Charity Hospital, knowing of Yang's ability to fundraise, invited Yang to cooperate, hiring her as a fundraising specialist, soliciting donations everywhere. Subsequently, because</p>
<p>Yang was falsely using</p>
<p>the names of various hospitals to defraud people of money, someone reported it to the police, and they ordered the Chinese detective of the 50th Precinct to conduct an investigation, which led to the successive arrest of the defendants. Because the defendants were well-informed and knew in advance that the police had begun a secret investigation, they destroyed all the evidence. Now, only one donation book was found at Yang Ying's residence. Since September of this year, she has successively solicited donations from various sectors, reaching more than a hundred households. The police also went to seventy businesses that had been defrauded to investigate, and they all stated that they</p>
<p>had indeed been deceived.</p>
<p>For example, the China Trading Company, the Bank of China, and the China &amp; South Sea Bank on Jiangxi Road could all prove that Yang and Sun had gone to solicit donations. However, because the donations were small, ranging from ten yuan to four jiao, it was considered a charitable act, and the losses were minimal, so they did not come to court. The number of cases committed by the defendants over the years cannot be counted. The police have received anonymous letters indicating that the funds obtained by the defendants amounted to approximately 100,000 yuan. Because the Western detective handling this case must go to the British court to testify in the case of an Indian policeman being shot, it is requested that the trial be postponed, said Detective. Judge Fu ordered Zhang Xuexiang to be released on bail of 300 yuan, and the remaining individuals were returned to detention pending a retrial in seven days.</p>

<h3 id="e186">Xin Chun Chi Bloodshed: Gu Wanfa Dies, Gu Had an Affair with Ni Gengyin's Wife, Ni, Harboring a Grudge, Committed the Murder with an Iron Bar <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Gu Wanfa, a 50-year-old native of Yangzhou, has been working as a heater and receptionist in the Xin Chun Chi bathhouse at 1379 Lujiabang Road in the Chinese area for many years. Previously, he had collaborated with Ni Gengyin (35 years old this year), a fellow villager and colleague, as a receptionist at Xin Chun Chi. Ni, due to his opium addiction, was lazy in his work and was dismissed by the manager after the January 28th Incident. At the time, Ni mistakenly believed that Gu had secretly instigated his dismissal, harboring resentment. Subsequently, Gu and Ni's wife had an affair, and when Ni was in financial distress, Gu provided some assistance. However, Gu recently encouraged Ni's wife to divorce Ni, which Ni learned of, further fueling his hatred for Gu. On the morning of the 16th of this month, at 5:30 AM, Ni hid an iron bar and, taking advantage of the Xin Chun Chi opening its back door for the cleaner to empty the toilet, seized the opportunity to sneak into Gu Wanfa's area of Xin Chun Chi. Without asking any questions, he pulled out the iron bar and struck Gu's head violently, causing a skull fracture and profuse bleeding. The assailant immediately turned around and fled. The bathhouse staff Kong Qingsong and Xu Zhengshan caught a glimpse of him and tried to pursue the assailant, but it was too late. They immediately informed the accounting office and had Gu taken to Guangci Hospital for treatment. At the same time, they reported to the local Public Security Bureau to dispatch personnel to investigate and apprehend the assailant. However, Gu died from his injuries on the morning of the 18th. Because the incident occurred in the Chinese area and the injured person died in a concession hospital, Xin Chun Chi notified the deceased's nephew, Gu Deshan, who appointed lawyer Zhao Zuwei to file a petition with the Second Special District Court Procuratorate requesting an autopsy. The court ordered the relatives of the deceased to report to the Public Security Bureau to have the body transported to the autopsy room of the Tongren Fuyuan Branch. The following day, Prosecutor Wang Ren of the Second Special District Court, accompanied by a forensic doctor and clerk, arrived at the scene at noon to examine the body. Sitting in court, they heard the testimony of the deceased's nephew, Gu Deshan, who stated that he did not know the circumstances of his uncle's assault and death. He was notified by Xin Chun Chi afterward. He now requested to claim the body for burial. Witnesses Kong Qingsong and Xu Zhengshan were not present. The officials declared that Gu Wanfa had indeed died from a head injury caused by the assault. The body was claimed by the deceased's nephew, Gu Deshan, for burial. It was also announced that the case file would be transferred to the Shanghai Local Court Procuratorate for the Public Security Bureau to apprehend the assailant and bring him to justice.</p>

<p>Liu Hantao, Fu Chaobai, Yin Jiafu, Wang Dongcai, Guan Yaoting, and the other five members of the Blood Soul Assassination Squad, were arrested by the Public Concession Police and prosecuted by the First Special District Court for throwing bombs at shops in the Public Concession to warn them against selling inferior goods. After being sentenced to imprisonment, the French Concession Police transferred Liu and the other five to their custody, believing that they had committed the same crimes in the French Concession. After investigation by the Second Special District Court, it was found that Liu and others had thrown bombs at four locations: Xiedaxiang Foreign Goods Store on Xiaodongmen Street, Yuanhe Sugar Store on Xinkaihe Road, Rixinsheng Foreign Cloth Store on Fa Da Malu, and Bei Runsheng's residence on Beile Road. The Police Department's lawyer then filed a public prosecution based on Article 151, Article 154, and Article 181 of the Criminal Code, alleging crimes such as disturbing public order and endangering public safety. After repeated hearings and deliberations by Judge Chen Shuoying, the debate was declared closed, and a date was set for the pronouncement of the verdict. These details have already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday was the date for the pronouncement of the verdict. Around 10:00 AM, Judge Chen arrived at the First Criminal Court and ordered the defendants to be brought before the court. After briefly questioning the defendants about their age and origin, he announced the main text of the judgment: "The defendants in this case are acquitted." He also summarized the reasons for the judgment: "The crimes committed by the defendants are the same as those committed in the Public Concession, and they have already been sentenced by the First Special District Court. Therefore, this court acquits the defendants." After the pronouncement, the defendants were ordered to be temporarily detained in the detention center, pending their transfer back to the First Special District Court for execution of the sentence.</p>

<p>The Haining Road branch of Xiang Sheng Taxi Company received a phone call around 7:30 AM yesterday morning, stating that they wished to charter a taxi, and the passenger would be waiting at the entrance of Pu'an Lane on Zhoujiazui Road. The branch then dispatched driver Zhang Heshang, a native of Chongming, driving taxi license number 18468. Upon arriving at the entrance of Pu'an Lane, they found a man in his thirties, wearing a gray cloth shirt and pants, waiting for the taxi. After exchanging greetings, the man stated that he had some items to move and asked to wait a moment. After speaking, he turned around and entered the lane. About four or five minutes later, the man came out carrying a newspaper-wrapped object in both hands, placed it on the taxi, and then re-entered the lane. Unexpectedly, he never came out again. The driver waited for a long time, unable to endure it any longer, and was also driven by curiosity. He slightly tore open the paper wrapping to see what was inside, revealing an Eight Lights Feigu brand wireless device, along with a piece of paper that read: "Now sending a wireless device by taxi driver, please check and receive. [Addressed to] Hongkou Police Station." The driver was completely baffled at the time, and he simply drove the taxi to the Hongkou Police Station, reported what had happened, and handed over the wireless device as evidence. After learning the details, the police, fearing there might be other circumstances, immediately dispatched detectives to Pu'an Lane to investigate and investigate the case.</p>

<h3 id="e196">After a Violent Beating, He Was Forced into a Poop Bucket, Sun Akang Makes Trouble for Shen Along, and Threatens the Factory Owner by Phone <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Sun Akang, a native of Jiading, has been working as a foreman at the Tian'an Can Manufacturing Factory at No. 42 Huade Road, earning 34 yuan and 45 jiao per ten thousand cans. The factory was founded by Jiang Zhifu, a native of Ningbo, in 1931 and has been quite successful. Recently, due to a slight decrease in business, the contract price was reduced to 33 yuan per ten thousand cans. Now, Shen Along, a local, contacted the factory owner, Jiang, offering to contract at 31 yuan and 50 jiao per ten thousand. He notified Sun Akang, who refused, so on the afternoon of the 7th of last month, at 3:00 PM, he invited Shen Along to the teahouse at No. 1107 East Broadway Road to discuss the matter, asking him to subsidize expenses on a monthly basis, to continue employing his original eight apprentices, and to pay a monthly contract fee of 45 yuan, before he could take over the contract. Shen, considering the subsidy to be too large, could not resolve it and told the factory owner, Jiang, who dismissed Sun Akang and let Shen Along be the foreman. Around 11:00 AM on the 15th of this month, Sun Akang had someone invite Shen to his house at No. 34 Huade Road under the pretext of talking, and then instigated more than ten people to beat him violently and force him into a poop bucket. After being persuaded to stop, the factory's accountant, Zhu Meisheng, received a phone call asking for the factory owner, Jiang, and claiming that Shen Along had been beaten and that all the costs of installing the machinery when the factory was opened and the unpaid wages, totaling 306 yuan, must be paid in full, or they would use the same means to pay him. Zhu informed Jiang Zhifu, who returned to the factory at 6:00 PM in the afternoon. Jiang Zhifu then reported the matter to the Huishan Police Station, which dispatched detectives to arrest him without success. Sun Akang surrendered to the police in the afternoon with his lawyer. The police chief ordered him to be detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Shanghai Municipal Council lawyer Zhang Shizhu explained the case and requested a postponement for further investigation, submitting the two promissory notes to the police station, one for Sun Akang's debt to Shen Along and one for his debt to Jiang Zhifu. Then, factory owner Jiang, accountant Zhu Meisheng, and the assaulted Shen Along testified about what had happened. When questioned, Sun Akang stated that he had been a foreman at the factory since it opened under Jiang's ownership, that the factory initially had only 10,000 to 20,000 yuan in capital but had developed successfully and now had more than 200,000, that he should not be dismissed, and that Shen Along should take over the contract. He also stated that Shen had previously worked for him for six months and denied threatening Jiang by phone. He also stated that Shen's beating was done by others who were dissatisfied and asked for leniency. Judge Xiao Xie Fan ordered him to be remanded in custody, pending further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Wu Ye Ruizhen Sues Her Brother for Embezzlement, Continued Hearing, Both Parties Instructed to Submit Evidence at the Next Hearing for Review <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Since Ye Zhongfang, a native of Suzhou, inherited his father Ye Huanyu's position as a comprador in the insurance department of the China Business Company after his death in July, he also took control of all his father's inheritance, which led to his married sister, Wu Ye Ruihua, hiring lawyer Li Zhongwen to file a criminal lawsuit in the First Special District Local Court, accusing him of embezzlement of inheritance, and filed a civil lawsuit to request half of the entire inheritance. The court has summoned him for questioning, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Dai continued the hearing. According to the defendant, Ye Zhongfang, he is the adopted son of Ye Huanyu. The inheritance consists of a house in Suzhou and 1,000 yuan in shares of a certain foreign goods store, all of which are currently managed by his adoptive mother. The deceased father had many concubines during his lifetime, but only one, Madam Xi, has been recognized by the family as his concubine. The plaintiff was raised and married by Madam Xi, and the adoptive mother also has an adopted daughter who has already been married. As for whether the inheritance can cover the debts, he does not know, and he is not currently managing it, so the plaintiff should not be able to receive a share. Madam Xi, Ye Huanyu's concubine, was also present to testify, stating that the plaintiff was brought by Huanyu at the age of twelve and ordered her to raise her. She was only married off this year. Huanyu was quite wealthy in the past, but since he operated the Dafa Chi Bathhouse, he suffered losses year after year, and only left behind a house in Suzhou and 1,000 yuan in shares. The plaintiff, Wu Ye Ruihua, stated that the living expenses of her stepmother in Suzhou were taken from the inheritance when her father died, and that the remaining assets, as Huanyu's biological daughter, she is legally entitled to one-half. The defendant and the married sister, one being an adopted son and the other being an adopted daughter, can only share the other half. However, the defendant's defense lawyer, Hua Maosheng, argued that this kind of inheritance dispute is purely a civil matter, and the plaintiff should not have filed a criminal lawsuit. Since he is accusing of embezzlement, he cannot list the facts of the embezzlement and requested an order for the plaintiff to provide concrete evidence. After reviewing the case, Judge Dai announced a postponement for further hearing on the afternoon of the 30th of this month, instructing both parties to submit evidence for review at the next hearing.</p>

<p>To whom it may concern: According to the parties concerned, Gao Yushan and Wu Zhile, after reading the news column in today's "Shen Bao," which contains two news items under the headline "Stealing and Copying Lamp Manufacturing Methods, Hua Yi Sues: Defendants Admit to Copying, Still Awaiting Investigation and Re-examination," the phrase "Defendants have admitted to copying" is not factual. During the court hearing on the morning of October 20th, Yushan absolutely stated that he created it himself and succeeded as early as the year before last, so there was no need to copy other people's methods. Zhile also only stated that he saw the announcement in the Industrial Bulletin and copied it publicly, which is completely different from admitting to copying. This can be verified by court records. However, "Shen Bao" has recorded it in this way, which is obviously inconsistent with the facts. We should request a written correction to clarify the true facts. This is a matter of public justice.

<p>Marital Knowledge</p>
<p>— Written by Dr. Yao Erchang, Medical Doctor of Ben Xue Weni University, America</p>
<h3 id="e208">Health is the Pillar of Marital Bliss <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>...When men and women begin to develop, they need knowledge to guide them into the paradise of life ... Sexual dysfunction is an evil that robs couples of happiness and is unique to weak youth ... Congenital deficiency, excessive sex after marriage, masturbation and gonorrhea are the main causes of this disease.</p>
<p>A young man goes through numerous physiological changes from birth to entering sexual life, and gradually enters the realm of sexuality in the evolution of these physiological changes. In general, physiologists judge that when men and women begin to develop, they need a kind of knowledge to guide them into the paradise of life, and this kind of knowledge is "sexual knowledge."</p>
<p>In the rapidly changing Chinese society, young people suffer unnecessary troubles due to lack of sexual knowledge. What we often hear and see in our daily life is the result of weak sexual knowledge among young people, which leads to the bad habit of masturbation, resulting in loss of physical strength and inevitable sexual dysfunction.</p>
<p>Sexual dysfunction is a disease unique to weak men. Those who are physically strong do not know what sexual dysfunction is, so they are forever insulated from it! However, there are very few such people. Therefore, there are still many troubled couples after marriage!</p>
<p>Sexual dysfunction after marriage can be roughly divided into three types: fatigue in marital life, relationship with age, and relationship with illness. The so-called fatigue period in marital life is the weakness of sexual sensation. Not only do they not feel interest and enthusiasm, but some even lose this function and are completely unable to have sexual intercourse. The second is sexual dysfunction caused by age, which is divided into those who experience it periodically and those who are actually aging. Periodic discovery is a common experience for anyone and should not be regarded as an incurable obstacle. Those caused by aging are purely due to the licentiousness and lack of willpower in youth, and they are infected with gonorrhea, so the gonads that dominate the health of Kang are destroyed. Therefore, the treatment of this disease should clarify the source of the disease and completely cure it before entering married life. Otherwise, it will not only feel tasteless, but also often cause bad consequences for the family.</p>
<p>The human body is managed by complex organs to live. If sexual dysfunction occurs, the youth glands (i.e., gonads) that control sexual performance must be weakened. Masturbation and gonorrhea are the main causes of gonadal weakening. In addition, congenital insufficiency and excessive sexual activity after marriage can also cause great sexual dysfunction. Regarding treatment, according to the clinical experiments of famous doctors around the world, there is no more effective and ideal preparation than taking a truly excellent gonadal hormone preparation, "Gonadal Hormone." This only refers to congenital insufficiency and premature decay caused by licentiousness. If you suffer from gonorrhea, in addition to this preparation, you should also take the "Antilin" preparation made of yellow pigment and valxin to clear the Neisseria gonorrhoeae inside and outside the urethra and mucous membrane. When I was in the United States, I was very effective in attacking these two diseases, so after returning to China, I often used "Gonadal Hormone" to cure thousands of patients with premature ejaculation and impotence, and the treatment of gonorrhea with "Antilin" was not much different.</p>

<h3 id="e209">Essential Course for Women's Fitness: Removing Wrinkles and Developing Breasts <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Zhang Junshi, Medical Doctor from Germany</p>
<p>... The appearance of wrinkles is an obstacle to women's beauty ... High and plump breasts are necessary for fitness</p>
<p>In recent years, although the Chinese women's community has been vigorously advocating fitness, it is still fruitless due to the stagnation of scientific progress and the backwardness of medical inventions. If we look across the ocean, we will find many new trends. In England, France, Germany and Austria, they already have scientific methods for removing wrinkles and developing breasts. Indeed, if a woman has annoying wrinkles on her face and withered breasts, no matter how gorgeous and eye-catching clothes you wear, you will still be ridiculed by others and regarded as an outdated woman. On the contrary, it can gloriously make people envy.</p>
<p>The appearance of wrinkles gradually emerges with the increase of age, and breast atrophy is mostly unavoidable for women who are physically weak and underdeveloped. Scientists and physiologists understand the relationship between aging and loss of health and the weakness of the youth glands (i.e., gonads). Famous doctors from various countries and well-known physiologists around the world strongly advocate the use of gonadal hormone preparations, "Gonadal Hormone" for women, to strengthen the gonads to prevent wrinkles and develop breasts. Because the effect is indeed effective, in the major commercial ports of various countries, you can see thousands of women who have lost their fitness lining up to buy "Gonadal Hormone" for women from pharmacies to engage in scientific remedies. In addition to the above-mentioned effects, this preparation can adjust menstruation, so women unanimously believe that this is necessary for fitness.</p>
<p>Experiences in Quitting Smoking</p>
<h3 id="e210">After Breaking Away from the Blacklist: Confessions of a Smoker Who Quit <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Yu Bofu</p>
<p>A middle-aged man with a ruddy complexion and surnamed Ma came to my clinic the other day, asking to check whether his smoking addiction had been eliminated. After careful examination, I found that the person had no tobacco poison at all, and all parts of his body were very healthy. He was overjoyed when he heard this, and recounted his experience of quitting smoking, which is worth referring to for those who are determined to quit, so I have recorded it on the left:</p>
<p>"I started smoking when I was sixteen years old. Now I am forty-six years old, so I have a history of thirty years. In the past, when the prohibition was strict, I tried to quit twice. I found prescriptions from all directions, made and took them according to the law. After a few days, I always felt weak all over, as if I was floating in the air, and my body had no place to put it, but I still didn't quit smoking."</p>
<p>Last year, my hometown (Taicang) held a smoker registration and went to get a license. When I came back, I thought that this would only last for a few years, and I would always have to taste the taste of being ordered to quit. The laws are much fiercer than before, and the county magistrate of my hometown is a person who will not be ambiguous at all. He himself will go everywhere to investigate. If I don't quit, I will inevitably suffer more.</p>
<p>I don't want to try the previous prescription again. A friend from Shanghai mentioned a drug called "Gonadal Hormone," which is said to be able to strengthen the body, restore the gonads that have been destroyed by tobacco poison, and unconsciously increase resistance, so you will hate cigarettes. I was very happy to see it at the time, so I took it continuously for two months, and the 30-year-old addiction left me. Moreover, my complexion was ruddy and very different from before. Although I had spermatorrhea in the middle, I bought and took "Schmidt's Spermatorrhea Pills" after seeing the newspaper report, and it stopped immediately. I came to Shanghai this time for business, and came here for a consultation. I got such good news, and my heart is even more at ease."</p>

<h3 id="e211">The Road to Self-Renewal for Patients with Masturbation and Spermatorrhea <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>Why are European men all heroic and majestic? How do pale sexual neurasthenia patients regain their health? Unprecedented contribution of the medical community to maintaining the national vitality of young people!</p>
<p>Thousands upon thousands of people, from every corner of the world, traveled to Europe to visit the Aring Peak Games held in Germany. No one did not praise the strength of German youth. Walking on the streets of Berlin, who is not tall, energetic, and with a strong chest. Who has ever found a few emaciated, pale sexual neurasthenia people in Berlin?</p>
<p>As long as you see this kind of situation, everyone will know why Hitler was able to build a world-class career. Really, with these strong young people, how can this country not be strong? Therefore, many people can't help but think of the young people in their motherland. They are often tempted by friends or misled by vulgar books and newspapers when they start to develop, and they practice masturbation vigorously, which leads to spermatorrhea. It is already known to the world that this self-conscious bad habit has become a common disease of the young people in the motherland. As a result, we see a large number of young people weakening, their will declining, and without waiting for the bombardment of the "friendly country"'s artillery fire, the national vitality is silently depleted.</p>
<p>However, we don't have to be pessimistic because of this. A superficial observer naturally only sees the majestic appearance of German youth. In fact, German youth are not the same as us. Most of them also often have the habit of masturbation and spermatorrhea. However, with the progress of medicine and the attention of society, when this situation is discovered, they immediately try to treat it to restore their health.</p>
<p>The German medical community generally recognizes that "Schmidt's Spermatorrhea Pills" and "Gonadal Hormone" developed and prepared by Dr. Stan are the most effective and free from abuses for treating this kind of patient. Therefore, these two drugs are simply household names in Europe. Even young people themselves, when suffering from spermatorrhea due to masturbation, mostly realize it and quickly buy "Schmidt's Spermatorrhea Pills" to consolidate their sperm gate and report "Gonadal Hormone" to nourish their essence. In this way, I don't know how many elite soldiers have been preserved for the country, ready to win glory for the country in future wars. Didn't you see Hitler marching into the Rhineland and recovering lost ground? Isn't that the great achievement of those young people!</p>
<p>Young people in the motherland, do you also hope to have a day like Germany regaining the Rhineland? If you want to speak, don't forget the above-mentioned two drugs. They have driven away your sexual neurasthenia and made you as healthy as a German youth.</p>

<p>(1) The Evil Consequences of Indulging in Masturbation</p>
<p>Patient Xuan Liming, 21 years old, from Changde, Hunan, complains: indulging in masturbation in his early years, causing spermatorrhea, mental fatigue, physical decline, and underdevelopment. Medical history: When he was 15 years old, he boarded at school and heard inferior friends describe the affairs of men and women and the pleasure of masturbation, and he was eager to try. Once and then it became a habit, from then on there was no night or emptiness. He gradually felt that his studies were regressing, his memory was difficult, and his vision was sharply reduced. After two years, he thought about quitting, but it was difficult to stop indulging, and he also suffered from spermatorrhea, so that his reproductive function was severely destroyed, withered and unable to develop. Current symptoms: general weakness, small genitals, frequent spermatorrhea. Treatment methods: First, administer "Schmidt's Spermatorrhea Pills" to stop his spermatorrhea, so that leakage is eliminated, so that there is no intensification and further deterioration. Then, have him buy and take a large amount of gonadal hormone preparation "Gonadal Hormone" to bring his endocrine back to normal, so that the atrophied sex organs can flourish again and redevelop, and the whole body and spirit can be full. Supplement it with electrotherapy surgery. After three months, all symptoms are swept away, sexual performance is sufficient, and the body is strong, and he becomes a handsome young man.</p>
<p>(2) Prolonged and Untreated Spermatorrhea Patients</p>
<p>Patient Yin Guoning, 38 years old, from Quzhou, Zhejiang, complains: When he was weak, he knew how to love himself and tried to avoid masturbation. However, he often read lewd books and paintings at Yuechai, and his heart was shaken. Although masturbation could be suppressed, lust could not be avoided. In his sleep, he had a beautiful woman hugging him, and he suffered from spermatorrhea. His strong body gradually declined. He got married at the age of 22, thinking that he could avoid it from now on. Unexpectedly, he suffered from premature ejaculation, and his spermatorrhea was not cured, his physique deteriorated day by day, and his will was depressed. He has been suffering from prolonged and untreated diseases for more than ten years. Although his wife is an old-fashioned woman, she has not divorced, and they also sleep in the same bed but have different dreams, and only exist in form. Current symptoms: rough customs, gonadal atrophy. Treatment methods: First take "Schmidt's Spermatorrhea Pills" to stop spermatorrhea and consolidate the sperm gate. Moreover, "Gonadal Hormone" is taken internally and electrotherapy surgery is used to replenish weakness and treat premature ejaculation. After two and a half months, he fully recovered, both spermatorrhea and premature ejaculation stopped, and the couple regained their lost relationship, but they were already nearing middle age. If he had been treated earlier at that time, why would he have had to endure this inhuman life for more than ten years. (Gonadal Hormone has two types, male and female, both of which are packed in iron boxes. Consumers must not mistake the paper box for counterfeit medicine, or mistake the gender, otherwise they will suffer great harm. Be careful)</p>
<p>Worry-Free Leukorrhea</p>
<p>Mr. Yang, from Dingxian, Hebei, his wife is weak and has a lot of leukorrhea, which is often dripping and unbearable, and also causes irregular menstruation, breast atrophy, etc. He had previously sought various medicines on the market for treatment, but all were ineffective. Recently, he was introduced to purchase two boxes of "Leukorrhea Relief" by mail from the Shanghai Anliss Company, and he was completely cured after using it. He wrote a letter to thank him and bought half a dozen "Female Gonadal Hormone" to treat her weakness.</p>
<p>Self-Treatment for Stomach Problems</p>
<p>Mr. Lu from Suzhou River Street wrote in a letter: I have been running around for years, and it is difficult to get used to food in different places. I reluctantly swallow it, and over time it becomes a stomach problem. Production pain does not stop, and doctors are helpless. I occasionally saw in the newspaper that there are two medicines, "Stomach Pain Relief" and "Stomach Strengthening Hormone". At first, I thought that the advertisement exaggerated the story, but after buying and taking it, the pain stopped and the amount of food increased. It is really a famous medicine in the world.</p>
<p>Infertility After Long Marriage</p>
<p>Mr. Hu from Tongfu Road, this city, wrote in a letter: My husband and wife are both weak, and since we got married, we have remembered that it has been four years, and we have not had children. Last winter, we were introduced by someone and purchased "Gonadal Hormone" for men and women. After my husband and wife took it separately, we suddenly felt stronger, and the pleasure between each other increased suddenly. It has not been a year now, and my wife is already five months pregnant. I am sincerely overjoyed.</p>

<h3 id="e212">Back Pain Must Be Cured Early <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Zhou Xiaohan</p>
<p>Back pain is easily felt by those with weak resistance. The reason why resistance is weak is all caused by acquired imbalance in addition to congenital insufficiency. For example, adults indulge in masturbation or indulge in lewd desires, energy is consumed, and physical strength is lost. In addition, the work cannot be adjusted, overwork, and living habits do not meet hygiene standards, resulting in infection with madness and dampness. When young, because resistance can still be maintained, although the disease has been latent, there is still little feeling. It will not be until after excessive work that there is almost no feeling. General famous doctors all believe that this disease is the only cunning disease that takes advantage of people's dangers, which is indeed a famous saying.</p>
<p>Usually, people with strong physical strength will not break out until their twilight years. If you already feel it in middle age, you should treat it early, otherwise this disease can progress in stages and make your whole body numb and fall into a state of hemiplegia.</p>
<p>According to expert clinical experience, the first method of treatment is "Strongton's Bone Pain Pills". Famous medical journals in various countries do not hesitate to promote it with large-character headlines. The drug has the function of removing madness, dampness and sweeping away blood toxins. It is not comparable to ordinary bone pain medicines. If the patient has weak resistance, or post-illness imbalance and congenital insufficiency, at the same time, he should take "Gonadal Hormone". This is a good method of treating and supplementing at the same time.</p>
<p>Patient Zhang Zhiheng, 37 years old, has felt the pain of back pain for five years. He did not receive medical treatment, so in recent years he has fallen into a state of whole-body numbness and inability to move his hands and feet. He began to be treated by me in August this year. After taking "Strongton's Bone Pain Pills", his joints felt relaxed, and his back felt comfortable. He only took three boxes in total.</p>

<h3 id="e213">Important Information for Treating Gonorrhea <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Dachao, Bachelor of Medicine, University of Hong Kong</p>
<p>A medicine seller said to a person suffering from gonorrhea and orchitis: "It's nothing serious, it won't lead to major problems. Let me put on a nice suspensory for you, then apply some of the oils we make, and use it according to the instructions inside. You'll get better." The patient asked again, "What about the swelling and pain in my testicles?" The medicine seller replied, "That's not my concern. It's all psychological. Once I've applied it, it will naturally disappear." After a few days, according to the patient himself, "It was ineffective, so soon the patient went to the hospital."</p>
<p>For many years, I have often seen many gonorrhea patients whose conditions worsened due to improper treatment. Once, I came into contact with more than ten chronic patients who said that their conditions became chronic entirely due to choosing the wrong medication. It shows that things like the above are too numerous to mention. Effective medicines for gonorrhea are not lacking. For example, the compound preparation of Flavine and Vaccozine "Antilymph," which is recommended by gonorrhea experts worldwide, surpasses everything else because its ingredients truly have the ability to penetrate membranes, kill bacteria, and produce anti-toxic bacterial vaccines. The reason why tens of thousands of chronic gonorrhea cases around the world must take this to be cured is precisely because of this.</p>

<h3 id="e214">Saving Peace and Self-Salvation <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Li Xuelian</p>
<p>According to the 16th report, the World Peace Congress, which held meetings in Beijing from September 3rd to 6th, issued a declaration, "earnestly requesting people all over the world to actively safeguard peace." The declaration began by saying: "The first World Peace Congress was attended by more than 4,000 representatives from 35 countries, 750 ethnic groups, and 40 international organizations. Thus, the Congress received enthusiastic support from religious groups, war veterans, trade unions, cooperative organizations, intellectual organizations, women, farmers, and youth organizations, as well as all peace forces from the Conservative Party, Liberal Party, Democratic Party, Socialist Party, and Communist Party. Our common slogan is: "Peace has reached a critical juncture, and we must save peace!"</p>
<p>The Congress met precisely when the arsonists of Europe were fueling the Spanish Civil War with planes and cannons. Therefore, the declaration of the Congress also solemnly stated: "We call upon all those who have not yet joined our ranks with the greatest eagerness to rise up and participate in our expanded movement. Our movement absolutely does not interfere in internal affairs. Our only goal is to ensure that all nations, large and small, equally obtain peace. Our only enemy is the aggressor who tramples on international justice and endangers world peace!"</p>
<p>The smell of gunpowder is already filling the whole world, whether in the Far East or Europe, it is as stated above! "Peace has reached a critical juncture." The Spanish Civil War, supported by the imperialisms of Germany, Italy, and Portugal, and the "undeclared war" in the Far East for the past five years, need not be mentioned; since the Nazi Party's Nuremberg Rally, everyone knows that German imperialists are even more actively preparing to covet the vast territory of the Soviet Union. "Peace is indivisible," and events and military-political dynamics in every corner have the potential to affect the safety of the whole world. Therefore, the World Peace Congress is undoubtedly a very crucial institution at the moment. And the consolidation and expansion of the World Peace Front will be followed by a reduction in the crisis of war. In order to save humanity from being ravaged by war, and the fruits of human labor accumulation – "world civilization," every righteous person has an obligation to participate in defending peace.</p>
<p>We are currently suffering from the brutal "undeclared war," which is closely related to the entire world peace. The arsonists in the East are no less than the flames of Hitler in the West. In order to uphold the great belief of mankind – peace, we have the right to resist this only enemy in front of us.</p>
<p>We must save humanity trapped in war, and also save ourselves who are淪落落 in slavery and colonies, and defend this invaded country with all our strength.</p>
<p>Therefore, internationally, we must link up with the entire peace front, and domestically, we must concentrate the strength of any faction and any class of ours to form a united front for national salvation; unite to resist this unprecedented human catastrophe!</p>
<p>We must save world peace, and also save ourselves!</p>

<p>— Rong</p>
<p>Stepping out of the alley entrance, it seems brighter; those dozen or so shops that have been closed for half a year, suddenly the one near the alley entrance is surrounded by many people. The newly painted counter is still emitting a pungent smell, and a sign is hanging in front of the door, densely written with rows of small characters. The top row is the brand of cigarettes, and below are soap, thread, and all kinds of daily necessities. There are three or four shop assistants busy greeting customers. I am quite happy for the owner of that tobacco shop for this rare liveliness. Because every day I step out of the alley entrance, I always wonder</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>why no one comes to open such a shop. More than a hundred households living in this alley would feel it is too troublesome to go to the opposite street to exchange money, and many daily necessities for households in Shanghai's alleys depend on the tobacco shop. No matter how bad the market is, this sign is still a good business.</p>
<p>Going home in the evening, they haven't closed yet. I am used to seeing a row of dark shutters every day, and this sole shop standing there looks quite outstanding. At this time, a bald middle-aged man is serving customers in the shop. Seeing that I am a customer jumping off a rickshaw, he greets me with a smiling face:</p>
<p>"Sir, do you live in the alley?"</p>
<p>I nodded and casually asked, "Is business good?"</p>
<p>"Thank goodness! Thank goodness!" He drums on his bald head, which is the unique attitude of Chinese merchants, while counting the coppers for my exchange.</p>
<p>In this way, in less than three days, we have become very familiar. Whether exchanging coppers or buying cigarettes, we have to exchange a few words, and he is especially polite to me. For example, when exchanging coppers, although the sign clearly says it exchanges at 9.9 cents per yuan, he gives me the full amount. The old hands who run tobacco shops calculate carefully on coppers. One yuan, from cents to coppers, is at least four or five coins different from directly exchanging coppers. The first time he exchanged ten dimes for my yuan, I felt very sorry and added three more coppers, but he refused to take them no matter what:</p>
<p>"Living in the same alley, taking care of the small shop's business makes up for it!"</p>
<p>After a few more days, the two boxes of cigarettes that I am used to buying for twenty cents each, he gave me two coppers back. I hesitated and looked at his smiling bald head, and then looked at the sign above, which specially marked the prices of various cigarettes in red powder, each one being one coin less than usual.</p>
<p>"Price reduction?" I asked him.</p>
<p>"Big price reduction! Big price reduction!"</p>
<p>But the tone of his voice and the smiling face are not consistent. Seeing that his eyes are always looking at the opposite street, I turned my head to look, and it turned out that the sign of the tobacco shop on the opposite street was marked with very large characters in red powder. Although I can't see the prices on it clearly, I already understand that the two competitors are fighting there.</p>
<p>The next day, when I stepped out of the alley entrance, I was attracted by a large sign in front of the counter of the tobacco shop on the opposite street. Each bar of Guben soap was marked with fourteen coins, the nine characters being as big as bowls. This is naturally another sign of a big sale, but I have never known the real price of this kind of thing, so it is naturally inexplicable how much cheaper fourteen coins per bar is than usual. Looking at the front of the bald head's counter, there is also a similar large sign, which says twenty-two bars of Guben soap per yuan. I calculated in my stomach that at the exchange rate of 3,010 cash, it would be another seven coppers cheaper.</p>
<p>"Old Guan," I asked him when buying cigarettes, "The loss these past two days is not small, right?"</p>
<p>He wiped his hand from his bald head and spat:</p>
<p>"Really want to save face and live like a ghost! Selling Guben soap for fifteen coppers still doesn't have much profit – that's just to respond to the market. Selling ass, selling it for fourteen each! Fine! Twenty-two yuan for one yuan, calculate it, 3,080."</p>
<p>He shook his head, indicating that our boss has a lot of capital and doesn't care about losing a few coins.</p>
<p>I walked away smiling.</p>
<p>They sing duets every day, and many items, even I, an amateur, know are cheaper than the purchase price. Sometimes, the sign for exchanging foreign currency suddenly increases by several coppers compared to the market price, and everyone in the alley is discussing where the two bosses offended each other.</p>
<p>One morning, stepping out of the alley entrance, the bald head's tobacco shop had dark shutters up again. The large sign on the opposite street has naturally been taken in, and the prices on the sign in front of the door have probably returned to their original prices, right?</p>
<p>In the first few days, I often stopped the car at the alley entrance and reluctantly went to the opposite street to exchange coppers. The trouble is secondary. Seeing every face in their shop, I immediately think of that bald head shaking his head, "Want to save face and live like a ghost!" It seems that the angry look of him wiping his hand from the bald spot and spitting is rippling in front of my eyes.</p>

<p>— Written by Ma Mengchen</p>
<h3 id="e217">Small Street <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Jiaqian</p>
<p>Yesterday, the night train arrived at × county, and I got to the inn at 2:00 AM. After sitting on the train for a whole day, my back and waist were sore. Seeing the bed, I immediately wanted to lie down and relax my limbs that had suffered a day's imprisonment. But when I asked the porter here, the first gasoline boat would leave at 5:00 AM, and the inn was half an hour away from the dock. Counting on my fingers, there would be at most two hours to sleep after deducting the beginning and the end. Everyone discussed and prepared to sacrifice to the end, and sleep on the boat. It would be very easy to sit for two hours. We told the porter our idea and asked him to find some wine and dishes for us. Originally, we should have put some food into our stomachs at this time. Our dinner was a plate of egg fried rice that looked like a decoration before getting on the train.</p>
<p>But that thin porter had quite a bit of experience in catering to guests from other provinces. He said that small places have small situations, and there are really no shops to buy things in the middle of the night, and the inn doesn't sell wine or food. He said that if the gentlemen were happy, he could take us to a place. As he said this, he deliberately shrunk his head and stuck out his tongue, that kind of sneaky appearance would make people think of the clown with a white nose on the stage.</p>
<p>Of course, there was no need for him to explain in detail what a good place that was. Everyone already understood it. So the three of us held another meeting. To investigate in this small market town (these two words might be too official, but we really had this intention.) The situation of those poor insects who were being squeezed by life might not be a completely boring act. We immediately agreed to the porter. At the same time, we didn't plan to return to the inn anymore, so we entrusted him with the luggage and asked him to deliver it to the dock before five o'clock, and there would be a generous reward.</p>
<p>That porter was extremely happy, and answered with a series of "Yes! Yes! Yes!" in a heavy nasal voice. He also specially returned to the small room to put on a long gown, lit a horse lamp, secretly communicated with a small waiter sleeping on the counter, and led us onto the street.</p>
<p>The street was as if it were dead, and there wasn't even the sound of dogs barking. The distance between a few kerosene street lamps was always more than four or five zhang. We paid attention to the circle of light illuminated by the horse lamp, and walking was almost like surveying the terrain.</p>
<p>Just as we were about to turn into a small alley, we met a policeman on duty. The porter chatted with him for a while using a kind of "code" that we didn't understand, and let us pass.</p>
<p>I'm not deliberately exaggerating about that small alley. If someone is a little wider, their shoulders will suffer a bit of damage. The porter told us that it's called Small Street, and it's the small base of prostitutes. The fact that the prostitutes here have to donate a few dollars of flower donation every month should be a public agreement, but if the policeman on duty finds out that someone is keeping a guest overnight, they will ask you to sit inside for a night. Although you will have to spend a little "exit fee" the next day, the "business" is getting worse and worse. The policeman we met deliberately "patrolled" at the corner of Small Street, which is what that means.</p>
<p>After walking past ten or so broken houses, the porter stopped in front of a house with a number 12 kerosene lamp. The door was ajar, and we followed him in. After passing through a foul-smelling patio, perhaps they had already heard our footsteps inside, and a young girl came out to greet us. She first talked to the porter before asking us to sit inside. The porter asked us for two dollars, explaining that he had to split it with the policeman on duty.</p>
<p>That room can be described with the four words "messy and disorganized." Apart from this "extra money" of ours, I thought that if the guests who come here don't come specifically to stay overnight, then there must be too few places to spend money in this market town. That little girl probably saw that we were guests from other provinces, and was busy making tea and putting out two plates of melon seeds and peanuts, and loudly called her mother to go outside to watch, and if the policeman on duty came, He Er (the porter's name) had already given a greeting.</p>
<p>When He Er was about to leave, he specially whispered in my ear: "If anything happens, He Er will guarantee it. Let the gentlemen enjoy themselves." Then he shrank his head, stuck out his tongue, and left carrying the horse lamp. (To be continued)</p>

<p>The fourth month of the Grand View is drunk in the flower season. Peonies are blooming everywhere. The order belongs to Qinghe, and the flowers are still good. Brother Bao's birthday is set up with a flower feast. The Hongxiang flower garden is brightly opened. People come under the flowers, full of joy. Drumming to urge the flowers, ordering wine. Borrowing flowers to offer Buddha, writing poems together. A beauty, after the feast, foggily looks for the flower path. Fluttering steps like a flower fairy. Flowers know people's intentions and add charm frequently. Intoxicated by the flowers, leaning on the stone to sleep. The flowers seem to be affectionate and pity the drunken state. Remnants of flowers protect the body, soft as cotton. Not knowing the fallen hairpin at the bottom of the flowers. People come to the flower path to pick up the emerald hairpin. The flower face is good. The drunken state is upside down. People are drunk and flowers are blooming, both beautiful. Flowers must be less colorful because of drunk people. People become more beautiful because of flowers. Don't suspect the bees and butterflies playing with flowers. A waist is caressed, and the flowers also pity. Birds sing in the flowers, breaking the dream. The sisters of all the flowers arrive in front of the flowers. Peach face is ashamed and hard to hide. Just tidying up the appearance of the flower, holding hands and spinning. The flowers and the moon in the Red Chamber will always flutter.</p>

<p>"Spring in the Maiden's Heart" is the most elaborate production of Universal Company this year. When it was screened in the United States, all newspapers unanimously believed that the film was the most humorous masterpiece of abundant jokes since the invention of sound films. The story in the film is based on the novel by the famous novelist Irick Heisch. It narrates the various scandals and strange appearances in the homes of the rich. There are all kinds of things, and there is nothing that is not strange. The humor of the dialogue and the slapstick of the action can really make people laugh and cry when they see it. The protagonist of the film is William Powell, who has always been good at playing gentleman-type roles. In this film, William appears on the screen in another guise. The first half plays a desolate scavenger in the slums, and the second half plays the steward of a wealthy family. The supporting actors include Carol Lombard and Elias Brody.</p>

<p>China's first horror blockbuster, "Midnight Song," has attracted much attention from movie fans. The film has unique features in photography and sound.</p>
<p>Jinshan's makeup in "Midnight Song": with a hideous face and withered fingers, it is almost the resurrection of a corpse. When silent, it makes people shudder.</p>
<p>After "Happy Night," Shi Dongshan will make greater efforts to direct "Bells of Huangshan," written by Tian Han. The selection of the protagonist and the location of the exterior scenes have been prepared and will be filmed soon.</p>
<p>There is a song in "Little Orphan Girl," sung by Chen Juanjuan, with a sad tone that evokes sympathy.</p>
<p>For the sake of amateur learning, Xinhua colleagues have set up a library and welcome donations of books and newspapers from various magazine clubs. They are willing to exchange with Xinhua Pictorial to express their gratitude.</p>
<p>Xinhua Pictorial is gradually becoming perfect. The content of pictures and texts in the fifth issue is more substantial, and the cover and binding are unique and stylish. The first edition of 12,000 copies has been sold out soon.</p>
