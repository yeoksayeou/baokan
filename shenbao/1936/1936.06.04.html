<p>今天是紀念禁烟先哲林文忠公九十七年前在虎門焚燬烟土的一日、我們追想林公當日大無畏的精神、和不屈不撓的毅力、眞覺得無限的欽敬、同時又不禁感到無限的慚愧、我們的先哲、爲了保障民族的健康與生存、至不惜任何犧牲、抵制外國烟土的輸入、不料幾十年以來、烟禍的蔓延、竟日甚一日、我輩後人、實在太對不住我們的先哲了、鴉片足以戕賊個人的健康、影響社會的生計、動搖國家的根本、阻滯民族的文化、爲禍之烈、令人寒心、林公遺訓云、「鴉片之毒、甚如洪水猛獸、天下萬世之人、斷無有以鴉片爲不必禁者、此禍不除、十年後無可用之兵、無可籌之餉」、實在是確切的名言、在歷史上我們可以看到不少的先例、一個民族的滅亡、往往不是單純的被別的民族用武力或政治的力量收服所致、而是由於這民族本身墮落腐敗的結果、反之任何外力的侵略和壓迫、對於一個有潛在力量、能够發奮圖强的民族、只可看作暫時的打擊、無論推殘破敗到什麽程度、這民族終究是能够複與的、所以我覺得鴉片的危險、遠勝於外侮、我國民族、能吾復興、要看我們能吾下大决心、振作精神、修明內政、增强國力、最重要者、就是看我們能吾剷除烟毒的禍害、近幾年來、中正於剿匪之餘、目睹我民族遭烟毒之禍、普遍深刻、長此以往、不但亡國、必至滅種、遂下最大决心、除此酷烈的毒害、因確立兩年禁毒、六年禁烟的計劃、並先後制定各種章則、分別施行、自從中央特別賦予以權責以來、每日兢兢業業、深懼不能實際貫澈、以負中央與國民的期望、現在各省市禁烟分會、都已先後成立、已登記的烟民達一百五十六萬以上、檢查實際的成績、也不能說沒有進步、但終究沒有照原定的計劃、達到預計的成效、其癥結所在、據我看來、大抵不外以下數端、第一是缺乏堅决的信心、因爲歷來禁烟、總未能澈底做到、允其是軍閥時代、所謂禁烟、不過是一種剝削民脂民膏的政策、而辦理禁烟事務的人、亦無不種此營私舞弊、致令一般人民對於政府的禁烟政策、一時不能恢復他們的信心、總以爲政府無非「寓禁於徵」、藉此斂財、就是各級民政長官、亦不無意存觀望、以爲禁絕鴉片、是不可能之事、而不能切實執行政府所頒布的法令、這實在是絕對要不得的錯誤心理、如果這種錯誤的心理不能打破、禁烟是永遠不會成功的、我屢决表示、政府對於鴉片之惡勢力、决不妥協降服、限期禁絕的政策、决不絲毫變更、政府更絕對沒有「寓禁于徵、」想延長稅收期間以圖財政上任何便利的意思、這一年多以來、多數民衆、也確已認識政府執行政策的堅决了、如果還有少數觀望的人、那就無異於甘心自誤、該極早快快覺悟、纔不致後悔莫及、第二是缺乏實幹硬幹的精神、過去主辦禁烟的機關、多是有名無實、或始嚴終懈、所以毫無成績可言、中國人做事、做不通的時候、總是喜歡歸咎于環境困難、其實這正是證明他自己沒有力量改造環境、排除困難、而爲環境所屈服、譬如有權有勢的人、違犯禁令、禁烟行政人員、往往懾於權勢、無可如何、權且敷衍了事、所以結果旣不能禁官、又不能禁民、只好淹旗息鼓、甘爲鴉片的俘虜、我們今後的禁烟、如果仍舊和以前一樣、開口環境困難、閉口環境困難、不能抱定澈底不降服政策奮鬥到底、那就一切都沒辦法了、我相信世問决沒有絕對不能解决的困難、也沒有絕對不能排除的障礙、有一分的努方、必有一分的成功、所謂「精誠所至金石爲開、」我們應該把這句話作我們的信仰、第三是缺乏合作的精神、我們知道任何社會問題、都不是獨立的片面的、而是關涉於整個社會的、鴉片問題、當然也不能例外、我們把普通人吸烟的原因考查一下、大抵不外以下幾種、一·社會衛生環境之不良、二·以鴉片爲治病藥劑、三·工作狀况、過於惡劣、四·好奇或受人引誘、細分析起來、與社會各方面都有關係、因此禁烟一事、决不是局部的片面的努力可以成功的、必須社會全體動員、彼此通力合作、向一個目標堅决的北同努力、才可以收效、而且如果我們社會上不論敎育政治衛生慈善各界、共同一致來努力、我們不但可以限期禁絕、而且必能提早禁絕、我以爲惟有社會的總力量、才是决定一切成敗的關鍵、總之、我們今天在這裏紀念我們的禁烟先哲、最重大的意義、是要檢查我們過去的錯誤、要效法林公實幹硬幹的情神、和不屈不撓的努力、並望全國民衆一致努力、與此惡勢力作殊死戰、務達目的而後已、末了、我不能不鄭重的提及中國禁烟的前途、還有賴於國際間的合作、因爲非法販賣鴉片和毒品的機關、可以存在中國領土之後、而非中國政府所能爲力、此種困難的情形、實非他國所有、假如外國的烟毒、仍繼續向中國輸入、我們所有的努力與犧牲、都會歸於失望、甚願各友邦對於中國不至採取英國政府所早已放棄的九十年前的毒化政策、致造成此種不幸的現象、而增加彼此間誤會的原因、（三日中央社電）</p>

<p>五　烟犯自首及烟毒犯總檢舉</p>
<p>本省辦理總登記時期、確係貧苦無力領照、以致規避登記之烟民、為　甚多、如果一一予以拘拿法辦、情殊可憫、爰於二十四年一月、呈准舉行烟犯自首、准許未登記之烟民、在江蘇省禁烟治罪暫行條例未經施行以前、向該管官署自首、發交戒烟所免費施戒、並從實免予科刑、以示恤刑愼獄之意、統計各縣自首烟犯、截至前項治罪暫行條例施行之前一日（二二四年三月三十一晶）止、有九千二百四十四人、均經分別戒絕出所、嗣於二址五年二月為澈底肅清烟毒起見、於烟民自新登記辦理　事後、舉行烟毒犯總檢舉、運用保甲組織、命令全省各級自治人員、及水陸公安人員、全體出動、層層督飭、限期辦理葳事、一面通飭各區行政督察專員各縣縣長親赴所屬各地督辦、同時山省派員三十一人、分赴各縣督促指導、綜計自二十五年二月十六日開始、至三月十八日截止、共檢舉烟毒犯二萬零五十八人、</p>
<p>六　取締栽種罌粟及取締私販私吸</p>
<p>本省奉令劃為絕對禁種區域、於民國二十三年冬、嚴令向各種烟商份縣政府、強迫剷除、並由省保安團隊派員協同辦理、故於二十四年春季烟苗出土時期、迭經派員明訪暗查、均稱互卉殆盡、今年春復派員分往各地遍查、結果以各級人員兩年來之認眞查禁、雖窮鄉僻壤、高山深林、曁與鄰省毘連各地、均未發現根株寸卉、全省毒卉可告完全肅清、</p>
<p>本省禁烟現採分年禁絕辦法、於法定限期內、對於已登記之烟民、及經政府核準設立之土膏行店售吸所、自準許其依法營業吸食、然仍有不肖之徒、甘犯法紀、從事於私販私運吸、破壞禁政之進行、故於緝私工作、迭經嚴訂辦法認眞辦理、一面為愼選緝私人員起見、於二十三年招考起見、於二十三年、　月招考查緝員八十人、設立查緝已訓練班、經四個月之嚴格訓練、然後分發各縣　任查緝工作、又於二十四年一月、成立查緝大訓練組、選擇警犬若干頭、援以對於烟土淺藏深藏行動藏以及高藏埋藏水藏之各項搜查技能、以補查緝人員工作之不足、綜計自二十三年八月至二十五年四月、經各縣自行破獲及省查緝員查緝犬協助破獲及省查緝員查緝犬協助破獲之烟毒案共一萬九千三百九十八人、</p>

<p>結論</p>
<p>本省限期禁烟、以登記領照、傳戒、勸戒、搜查復騐、生活救濟為施行統制之基本工作、謀逐步達到限期禁絕之目的、施行迄今已屆兩載、所有辦理經過情形憶述上、幸賴各級辦理禁政人員及地方人士、俱能一致推行、得以成效漸著、然依現規定施戒年度禁絕之期距今僅餘二年有四個月（本省施戒年度自二十三年十月一日開始、四年為限、應於二十七年九月三十日禁絕）、以本省烟民人數之多、地方情形之複雜、禁烟經費之支絀、今後自當益加努力以期如限完成、然則今後努力之方向為何、曰、　本旣定方針、積極辦理烟民傳戒、務使各縣登記烟民依年齡吸量之大小、並參酌戒烟所之容量先後分批切實戒絕、　舉行烟毒犯總檢查以達澈底肅清之目的、　擴充戒烟所之設備、並力求戒烟技術及行政管理事宜之改善、以便烟民樂於投戒自趨新路、　增設烟民習藝工廠等組織、使戒絕烟民各有謀生技能、以增加社會生產力量、他如統制土膏行店售吸所、管理烟民、抽查復騐、自應仍本旣定方策積極進行、以期風清弊絕、尚祈地方、熱心人士仍本往昔襄助之忱協力推行、俾本省禁政得以早觀厥成、是本人所馨香默祝者也、　（完）</p>

<p>新聲社云、章士釗律師、近以律務到京、並訪問政府方面各友好、曾於五月二十六日蔣院長招宴　席間關於憲法草案、有所陳述、內容如何、非外間所得而知、因之京滬間紛說章君主張總統獨裁、曾上萬言書於蔣院長之說、新聲社記者、昨訪章氏於寓次、要其在可能範圍以內、宣示眞相、俾釋誤會、</p>
<p>理想討論確是錯誤</p>
<p>章氏云、余素性坦白、絕無不可告人之事、當憲草公布之前王亮疇先生曾對余云、此次憲草、以國民為基礎、希望黨外之法學家、有一公平之批評、俾引起國人對於憲草之興趣、余答云、憲草本是現實的、非理想的、二十年前、吾人好以個人之理想討論憲法、確是錯誤、余多年不作政治論文、且以營謀個人生活之故、對於現時國民政府之政治組織、亦未暇詳細研究、先生囑余批評憲草、余於執筆之先、不得不略略考察現政情形、冀免鏧枘之病等語、</p>
<p>不重理想而重事實</p>
<p>此次在京發言、大體不外斯旨、蔣院長招宴席上之語、亦大同小異、余當時並稱引法國前例、謂法蘭西革命初成、民黨好以純粹理想製成憲法、而實行輙生齟齬、於是憲草屢成屢蹶　前後迭至十二次、而迄未定最後第三共和始遷就事實、力崇簡略、宣布千八百七十年之憲法、而大局以定、迄今六七十年、法國轉欣欣向榮、憲法不重理想而重事實、此種最為適例、</p>
<p>上書之事絕對無有</p>
<p>蓋法人理想甚高、造法與立法歧而二之憲法者、非造法機關不能制定、意謂先憲法而後國家、先國家而後政府造法乃造國家以先之法、立法則立政府以　之法、此中界域、何等嚴明、乃第三共和之憲法、至以麦馬韓將軍為第一任總統、任期七年之一條文、遽爾闌入、此關於政府用人之事、不知　造法幾階、而憲法中如此大書特書、不恤自壞其例、可見事實逼眞、良足推倒理想、此次吾國憲草、其合於今時事實如何、余尚未着手研討、殊難論定、至憲法之當以事實為重、則余敢斷然主張者也、當時發言旨趣、略不外是、至外間謂余主張獨裁、則未嘗一語及此、上書之事、絕對無有、記者以章君語頗質直、逐為表　如右、亦足語與當世、政治得失之林也、</p>

<p>昨日下午、為楊文道·葉海生·周社榮·被訴殺害日水兵中山秀雄一案續訊之期、代表工部局起訴之律師、本為汝葆彝·博良、昨日博良律師並不出庭、由厲志山律師與汝律師共同出庭、市府秘書張廷榮·市公安局第三科長黃華·仍到庭旁聽、二時十六分、由第二特區法院刑庭長錢　業·偕馮世德·蕭　　推事·張宗儒檢察官·丁重南書記官·升座刑一庭續訊、即據捕房汝律師起稱、上次庭上因根據棄海生之供詞、謂曾呑服</p>
<p>錀匙二枚</p>
<p>及金屬物於腹內、并受有傷害、乃論知將棄送工部局醫院、會同法醫檢騐、捕房當將葉送至醫院、經法醫會同予以檢騐、經先用愛克司光照騐葉之腹、內部有無　匙及金屬物存在、便結果騐得並無上列物個把存於腹內、又騐葉之傷痕、祗口唇上有微破、亦不能證明因何而破、現由工部局醫院副監督及愛克司光部主任之報告為證、而捕房方面對於葉所供有刑訊之點、極為重視、已予以調查、凡承辦此案之人員、上自副總巡勞勃生、下至探員、均製成報告書、述明辦理此案之</p>
<p>詳細經過</p>
<p>均可呈庭、而奉派赴青島調查之西探長克老特及日探、至今尚未返申、故請於審理後、予以延期云云、錢庭長核稟、即命丁書記官司朗讀　醫檢騐葉海生之報告、丁君即起而宣讀、大致謂騐得　之唇部、有一公分長·半公分闊·之粉紅色痕跡、而第六·第七·第八·根肋骨有軟物摩擦痕跡、讀畢、庭上即詢葉海生呑服　匙及金屬物之日期、據葉供、呑服鑰匙二枚之時、為第一次我供認去犯案之前、至呑銅　、則在　二次在庭承認之後、日期</p>
<p>不能記憶</p>
<p>庭上復詢以被刑情形、據葉供、在庭上改期二星期之後之二三天、將我眼紮住、復綁於凳上、以水灌入鼻部、後又以短香烟二支、塞入鼻部、故唇上之傷、即因此而生云云、庭上又訊楊文道、謂爾供該藏手槍之書、係楊建中所掉換、但供　中等均未提及楊名、楊答、實係楊所陷害、問、該書雨曾經看過否、答、在捕房時及第一次解法院時、均未看過、由法院回去之後、始給我看、但未着手翻閱、至此、葉海生義務律師張志讓即起稱、關於呑物一點、敝律師於接見時、葉即言及、惟稱當時</p>
<p>係在腹瀉</p>
<p>故已瀉出、亦未可知、今醫院檢騐得葉腹部內並無金屬物等存在但不能證明以前葉是否確曾呑過鑰匙與否、至肋骨有軟物摩擦傷、核與葉所供用拳摩擦之情形相府、而唇部之痕跡、據法醫報告、甚屬整齊、决非手指所抓傷、至上次庭上将葉海生送往工部局醫院、雖為檢騐有無傷痕、但亦含治療之意、乃捕房仍將葉謚檢騐後押於捕房、顯與</p>
<p>庭上裁定</p>
<p>相背、此乃過去之事、今且不論、現敝律師有一公充適當之改善　押方法、向庭上請求、即將葉海生改送鈞院看守所、而捕房儘可多派員警看守、至接見亦不妨依照捕房接見之辦法、庶免認為有弊、此點應請庭上採納云云、錢庭長即宣稱、本院所有之看守所、僅屬於民事者、貴律師恐冀有受刑之虞、如確有此事、承辦之人員、自須負責、目即使押於本院而捕房亦可隨時提回偵查、故所請難予照准、而唐懷羣律師即聲明、冀海生於上次開庭後、並不即送醫院、而於</p>
<p>翌晨送去</p>
<p>捕房汝律師即起而駁稱、自上次庭諭之後、捕房亦認為如確係呑有金屬物、則殊屬危險、故即刻送往工部局醫院、經以愛克司光照騐、並無如葉所稱之情形、則自毌　醫生之看護、故仍送回捕房、目葉並無疾病、焉能例外住於醫院也　錢庭長復宣稱、本院現接楊文道妻楊金氏之狀、請依照葉海生之先例、送往醫院、此點不能照准、旋詢捕房汝律師、今日傑克有否帶庭、汝律師答、據日領事署之理由、謂該署對</p>
<p>傑克部分</p>
<p>尚未偵查完畢、故不能送案、繼由證人張琛投稱、某日由曾元佳之妻囑我陪同鄭惠民家索欵、去時見楊建中坐於鄭之客堂內、衣黑色西裝、身材商極高大、由曾兀佳之妻對我言、此即楊建中、在以前我並未見過楊建中、是日亦未與之交談云云、訊至此、錢庭畏即稱、本院現已將檢獲之手槍及子彈與楊文道家抄出之挖洞書籍、送交法醫研究所鑑定、關謚子彈一點、請予鑑定者有三點、　該子彈是否曾穿過人之身體、　穿過身體後有無血跡、　有血跡經洗去後、</p>
<p>有無痕跡</p>
<p>、關於書籍應鑑定者有四點、　挖洞處藏槍經過多少時間始生銹、　銹能否人工造成、　該書之洞挖已多少時間、　裝拆處之藍色鉛筆痕留有多少時間、現該所謂可以鑑定、惟須極長時間、故本案應俟鑑定復到後再行審究云云、張志讓律師又稱、關於檢獲手槍之豊樂里亭子有無巡捕駐在及豊樂里看弄人李鴻斌、雖有供詞、而無供單二點、請捕房調查、並復重申改善　押之請求、捕房汝律師謂關於張律師所述二點、可予調查、至</p>
<p>改善覊押</p>
<p>一點、有所聲明、謂承辦此案之捕房、係屬狄思威路捕房、而捕房為愼重起見、特將葉　生押於成都路捕房、楊文道·周社榮·押於總巡捕房、實亦避免或有待遇不良之情形、且葉海生之待過、較任何人犯為優待、葉欲食何項菜飯、捕房均為照辦、且葉染香烟闢甚深、捕房亦將准其吸食香烟、即於接見律師時</p>
<p>亦吸香烟</p>
<p>、即此可見捕房待葉之優、辯護律師不信、可問葉便知云云、而楊文道之律師葛肇基·郭啟明·亦有所聲明、庭上以本案須候鑑定送到後、再行進行、逐宣告不定期改期、並裁定葉海生·與楊文道·周社榮、一併覊押於總巡捕房、逐退庭、時為三時零七分鐘、當未開庭之前、葉海生押至法庭後、涙流滿面、頻頻以袖拭目、其內心之苦、於此可見一斑、</p>

<p>二，五金市價之漲落</p>
<p>五金業之標價單位，以其商品繁多，性質各異，故其標價單位，多有分別。計其單位，有以噸，担，札桶，圈，箱，張等種，就大概而論，銅，錫，鉛等，以担為單位；鋼鐵條，　，則以噸計；鐵皮，鋼板，銅皮，銅絲等，大宗成交，多以担計，零星則以張計。馬口鐵以箱計，元釘，以桶為單位，鉛之計算單位有圈及担兩種，黑鐵皮以札或担計算。此外如鎖，刀，鋸，鉸，鏈等，有以　計，打計。至五金製造市價之漲落，當以海外　價之漲落為轉移。同時，市存之多寡，及需求之　弛，亦與市價之挺疲有關。惟此外我人尚需注意外滙之上落，例如去年十月份以後，外匯大縮，五金貨價即隨之猛漲，即其明證也。至其交易上開價，因無標準市塲之定盤，各家常有不同，　其原因，約有四端：第一，各家存底之多　；第二，市况觀察之不同；第三，薄有利沾，即　　手；第四，本身經濟關係。將上述各項因素綜合硏究，則於五金市價之漲落，或能見端緒矣。</p>
<p>三，本市五金販賣號及製造廠之現狀</p>
<p>本市五金業之分佈地域，一似有所規定。虹口百老匯路，熙華德路一帶之五金號，大體為小五金業：天后宮橋西首北蘇州路及民國路北京路一帶之五金號，多半為大五金業，銅錫業在法租界及南市民國路各地；鐵行業則在天后宮橋東首頭壩浪附近，及南市各地。統計四業之同業，就加入公會者　言，達　百餘家。就其經營帮別，而言，則以寗波　最多，無錫帮次之，其他各帮又次之。今將其各項情形分述於次：</p>
<p>組織及資本—上海五金業之組織，以合夥居多，而獨資者較少，公司組織，則絕無僅有。資本一節，大小不等，視其營業情形而定。　　經營銅錫業者，自五六千元，至四五萬元不等，而以五六千元至一萬元者為最多鐵行業，最大三四萬元，小者四五千元，而以六七千元至一萬元者居多。小五金業，大者約五六萬元，小者五千至一萬餘元，普通約一二萬元。大五金業，規模較大者，近二三萬元，中等萬元左右，小者三五千元。大抵上海之五金業資本，平均自五千元至一萬元為大多數，約佔全市該業十分之七八，上五六萬元者，祗數家而已。（未完）</p>

<p>— 蘇子涵</p>
<p>阮大年，明朝崇禎末年廣東新會縣的秀才，家裏很窮，沒有好穿的，旁人笑他，他也只當耳旁風。在一般才裏，他也並不是出奇的人物，但是他對於他的母親却很孝順，母親死了，沒有錢請泥工，他便自己揩土把母親埋了，天天都要到墳地上去哭，這樣一直過了三年。</p>
<p>李自成打破了北京，崇禎皇帝在煤山上吊死的信息傳到了新會，阮大年聽見了，大哭了幾天，也一連幾天沒有飲食，隨後他轉念一想：「我就這樣月死了實在不值得；我要在值得死的時候去死！」於是，他才恢復飲食。</p>
<p>那時就有人向阮大年說：「聽說閻賊殺進京城的時候，多少大臣都投降了，現在還是做大官。你為甚麼不去呢？却老在這裏吃苦，」</p>
<p>阮大年嘆息道：「這些人太沒有心肝了，我才想死咧！」</p>
<p>阮大年一時不想死，原是想盡自己的力量去恢復明朝，那天聽見有人勸他去降賊，便更氣憤起來，就馬上去召集隣舍，想在新會起事。但是那些人太膽小了，也太沒有忠義之心了，大家都不幹。阮大年奔波了幾天，毫無結果，他氣極了，一個人駕一隻小船，到厓門去，上了岸走到楊太后廟裏，跪在地下，大哭起來，厓門海邊上住的漁夫們，聽見廟裏有人哭，都跑來看，看見阮大年哭得那樣傷慘，有些人也不知不覺流下淚來，有些人便去勸阮大年。</p>
<p>阮大年哭得聲嘶力竭才住聲，立起來，看見這些漁夫們這樣容易受感動，覺得是一個機會，自己不能把這機會輕易放過。便向漁夫們說，「你們知不知道萬歲爺被　賊害了？」</p>
<p>漁夫們都詫異了，說！「我們不知道。這闖賊又是誰？」</p>
<p>阮大年說：「闖賊名叫李自成，是個大強盜。他到處奸淫燒殺，不知道害了多少百姓。此刻已經打破京城，把萬歲逼死了。我們是大明的人，應該替萬歲報仇，那些做官的只會拿錢，要殺賊，報仇，還是要靠我們自己。我一個人的力量太小了，成不了事。你們都是太明的老百姓，都是忠肝義膽的人，我們大家聯合起來，去殺賊罷！」</p>
<p>阮大年越說越激昂，漁夫們也聽得憤怒起來，都磨拳擦掌，恨不馬上就去。阮大年出來，悄悄的四處留意的察訪得漁夫中幾個有血性少年，告訴他們如此如此，這般這般，又過了幾天，一起約定的日子，便到海邊去點騐，有一百十隻漁船，四百多壯丁，阮大年便用兵法都勒好了，定下明日舉事，</p>
<p>同時，新會另外有一個秀才，名叫李子俶，家裏很有錢，每逢年成不好的時候，必定自己拿出錢來救濟窮人，所以有多少人都感謝他的恩德。當他聽見崇禎殉國的消息後，就寫了一個「大竹皇帝」牌位，供在家廟裏，帶領著家去上祭，去哭。也同阮大年在厓門哭楊太后時候一樣，到有多少人來看。</p>
<p>李子俶哭完了，就立起來向大家說：「大明自高皇帝平定天下以來，到現在已經三百年。我們的祖宗以來多少代人，都受了國家不少的恩惠。現在闖賊把萬歲逼死了，大臣們平常只曉得玩鬧，到危急的時候就降了賊，把國家弄到這個地步。我們百姓再不團結起來，去把國家挽救過來，艱見得大家只有一天一天的往地獄裏走了。我們活著是大明的人，死了是大明的鬼，不是很正當的事嗎？不過死要死得值得，我們大家一塊去找值得死的地方罷！」</p>
<p>李子俶的話還沒說完，人羣跳出三十歲條大漢，一齊嚷道！「李先生如果要救國，我們願意跟著去，湯裏火裏同在一塊，要死也死在一塊。那個半路變心，使不是人生父母養的！」</p>
<p>李子俶說：「這才是我李子俶的好朋友，國家的好百姓。我們親戚朋友裏面，總還有不少的忠義之士，請大家去約束，人手越多越好。」</p>
<p>不過十來天，得了五百多人。李子俶又拿種種忠義的話去說新會境內的強盜們，強盜們答應一道去幹救國的事業。這一來，就有一千六百多人。</p>
<p>李子俶聽見阮大年在厓門，就帶了這一千多人到厓門去。</p>
<p>這兩位滿腔忠義的讀書人在厓門會著了，一見就抱頭大哭，哭得軍中人都情不欲生，恨不得馬上去殺賊。</p>
<p>阮大年先住了哭聲，說李兄：大臣們胡作妄為，把國誤了，我們聖明的皇帝也算死在他們手裏，國家鬧到這步田地。好在人心還沒有死，你我不過是一個秀才，但是登高一呼，就集集了這樣多的忠義士，國家事還有辦法哩！」</p>
<p>李子俶也住了哭聲，說：「是啊！人心未死，國家還可以恢復。現在兩京早已立了皇帝，我們還是到南京去勸王；那比這裏有辦法。」</p>
<p>兩人問了起大家，大家都願意到南京去。</p>
<p>阮大年李子俶兩人帶領了這一千多人，上了船，打算往海上到上海，轉長江到南京去。</p>
<p>一天，海裏起了大風，波浪隨著風勢，如山一般，在海裏升起降下，滾來滾去。阮大年李子俶這一隊船在鑽進鑽出，彼此失了聯絡。風越刮越大，波浪也越來越大，這些木船怎經得這樣的風浪？他們死力同風聲掙扎，但是不行，已經被浪打翻了不少的船，滿海都是船底，翻轉了西瓜皮似的，在茫茫大海中汆來汆去；滿海都是死屍，在那裏隨著波浪漂流。</p>
<p>船雖然翻了不少，但是阮大年李子俶他們仍然拚命同風浪掙扎，在浪山裏極力使自己的船不翻。</p>
<p>這風刮了一天一夜，才漸漸地住了，浪頭也平下去了。阮大年李子俶收集了不曾翻的船隻，點了一點，已經翻了一大半，只剩下三五百人，但是他們仍然不灰心，仍然帶著這些人向南京去。</p>
<p>這天走到崇明島，已經到了長江的日子，才知道史可法已經死了，南京已經失了。剩下的這三五百人聽見了這消息，知道大事已去，有些便散了，只剩下幾十個人，阮大年李子俶無法，只好辭了這幾十個人回新會去</p>
<p>不久，福建同浙江都立了皇帝，但是阮大年同李子俶決定到贛州去。</p>
<p>臨走的時候，大家都勸道：「現在闖賊已經死了，清朝已經佔了大半個天下，黎遂球一個人成得甚事？去幹嗎！」兩人不聽，仍然到贛州去了。</p>
<p>到了贛州，見了黎遂球，黎遂球問道：「二位來見我，有甚麼事兒敎？」</p>
<p>阮大年李子俶同聲答應：「在將軍這裏來找一個值得我們死的地方。」</p>
<p>不久，清朝的大兵到了贛州，日裏夜裏都在攻打，沒有歇息的時候，虧得黎遂球死力支持，才支持了幾天。但是清兵的勢太盛了，終歸支持不住，城被打破了，清兵如潮水一樣湧進城來，黎遂球便同清兵巷戰，筋疲力竟，死於陣中！</p>
<p>阮大年李子俶在城頭上看見城池破了，黎遂球陣亡了，就拔出身伴的短刀，仰天大叫道：「列祖列宗在天之靈，小臣今日有了報國的機會，死也值得了！」兩人飛步下城，迎著那如潮水一般的清兵，挺刀刺去，一連刺死幾個。清兵初時吃了一驚，俟後看見是兩個書生，那裏放在心上，刀槍齊舉，頃刻之間阮大年李子俶就在亂刀槍之下被確成了肉醬</p>
<h3 id="c196">諾貝爾Alfred　Nobel　1833-1896　——炸藥發明家 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— （果軒）</p>
<p>只要是一個人，誰都在怕著現代的戰爭吧？上海的閘北，被什麼東西給轟平了？我們只要一聽見頭上嗡嗡地響，為什麼就坐立不安？我們為什麼要怕別人，不敢同人家見個高低上下呢？</p>
<p>我想，我們怕人家的，就是利害的兵器，我們所沒有的，也就是這兵哭！</p>
<p>現代已經不是大刀梭標的年頭了，十六吋口徑的大砲，可以發射一噸（一千六百多斤！）的砲彈，在七英里（即三十華里上下）以內他可以穿透一尺厚的鋼板，請問什麼樣的人禁得住這傢伙？什麼樣的房子禁得住這傢伙？歐洲大戰時，德國兵硬從比利時經過去打法國，比國人在安特衛普建築了極結實的砲台，預算可以守三個月，不想在十一天之內，所有砲台上的堅石，都被德國的在砲打成灰塵，那個城只好投降！飛機呢？還不是一樣嗎？大的炸彈的一般有一噸重，那東西從空中落下來簡直要天翻地覆！二百四十磅重的一顆炸彈，他的力量已經使我們驚訝了，——恐怕普通的地窖都抵抗不了他的力量！——何況一千多斤重的呢！</p>
<p>什麼使他有這樣大的力量？——還不是炸藥！</p>
<p>說起炸藥來，我們也慚愧，這東西還是我們中國人發明的呢！據說在中國隨時，（離現在一千五百年左右）已知用火藥變戲法，到宋朝就利用他來打仗，但是直到而今，我們還只是那些用「爆竹」「花盒」裏的木炭火藥，並沒有什麼進步，西洋人却拿了他欺侮起我们来了！當我們過新過爆竹的時候，也曾想到這東西含有那麼大的用處嗎？</p>
<p>火藥所以能發大力的理由，很簡單，就是他原來是液體固體，一經受勢或受電以及撞擊等，聽然變成氣體，體積便要無前因在若干倍；譬如把一些火藥放在房子裏，一旦爆發，能把窗戶吹開，門扇震壞，　試想若再把他較在細小的槍砲管中，力量如何不大！近代的火藥，比古時的火藥力量更要大若干倍，原因就是近代化學一天比一天發達，人類知道選擇爆發力更大的原料製造火藥罷了。我所要說的諾貝爾就是改良火藥，使他力量增強一人。</p>
<p>原來火藥並不是只用作殺人的，他更可以利用到開礦築路等於人類有利的事業上去。例如火車遇山，要開隧道，若只用人力，那如何得了？這時就得大量地使用炸藥。例如法國和意國中間的塞尼山隧道，在一八五七年開始工作，起初用舊時的黑色火藥轟炸，預算要二十四年完工，後來一種猛炸藥發明了，於是工程提早完成十一年，我們看，炸藥豈不是一樣可以造福人羣呢？只看人類如何利用他就是了。</p>
<p>諾貝爾是歐洲北部瑞典人，這個冷冰冰的國家，人民大都賦有強毅的性格諾貝爾也不是例外。他父親本是一個機械師，家庭環境，可以說自幼便與科學相近。但他父親却沒心事造就他成一個火藥發明才，而是想叫他能夠繼續自己的事業。故他在中學畢業後；就被送到俄京聖得堡大學工科去讀書，專門學機械。諾貝爾年二十二歲，已在大學畢業。</p>
<p>此時有一個法國的批克准將軍研究炸藥很有名。批克准本是軍器製造家，他想設法增加子彈射擊的距離，所以研究改良火藥。原來早日火藥的搆成無非是木炭硝石硫磺等物的混合劑，雖能爆炸，力量很小。批克准研究火藥的消息喧傳在報紙上以後，頗引起諾貝爾的興趣。因為當他在大學時，已經開始注意製造新式炸藥的原料，硝化甘油的研究了。</p>
<p>但諾貝爾研究炸藥的動機，却不是要帮助人類打仗，而是站在帮助人類建設的立塲上。他不分晝夜的伏在試騐室裏，想要實現他的理想。他的父母，對他這種　氣的舉動，很不贊成，許多親友也勸他甚至幾天他不該和沒有影子的夢，我們可以說諾貝爾同其他發明家一樣，起初也是遇到好多打擊的。但他並不灰心，每天只是和那些極濃烈的藥品相對，如像硝酸，硫酸，等，衣服燒得大洞小洞，有時皮膚也要灼焦，自然嘍，在他的發明沒有成功以前，大家對他的譏笑也只有一天比一天利害起來。</p>
<p>諾貝爾在試騐室裏埋狀苦幹，一下就是二三年功夫過去了，他累得骨瘦如柴，精神萎頓，但希望的東西，還是毫無辦法。有時他自己工作到半夜，只有冷冷的月光陪伴他罷了，任何人都在甜甜地睡著，這偉大的科學家，看到自己的凄涼狀況，也不免滴下一點淚來。</p>
<p>他相信「硝化甘油」一定有極猛烈的爆發性，可以製成猛炸藥，但試騐了幾百次，老是失敗，後來他才覺察到並不是硝化甘油的毛病，而且導火綫不完備之故。於是他又設法改良導火綫，這又費去他許久的時光，結果也是失敗。他又將導火綫改良為爆發管，費了九牛二虎的力量，還是徒勞無功！他眞有點莫明其妙了。</p>
<p>最後，他想用一種名叫爆酸録的藥品裝入爆發管中，也許有效，於是他就開始裝置起來。但是，究在何時燃火，燃火以後，是否果能爆發呢？他正在自己疑慮著；忽然，砰，砰，砰，砰，天翻地覆的聲音從他面前發出來，一切試用的東西，都飛到屋外去了！眼前只是一片白茫茫的煙霧。</p>
<p>家中人聽了這巨大的聲響，情知是出了亂子，出來一看，但見黑煙從諾貝爾的試騐室裏冒出來，那屋子的頂棚已是沒了，許多雜物狼籍在地下，發著燃燒的煙氣。他的父母不顧死活地鑽到裏邊去，才把諾貝爾後所流的血。大家看了他那可憐的樣子，委實吃驚不小！但諾貝爾却不慌不忙地說道：「你們不必害怕！我是死不了的！……啊！我的工作成功了！成功了！……快給我一杯水，我渴得要命！」立刻有人給他斟了水，他吃了之後，精神更加奮發起來，兩隻充滿了血腥的手，不覺舞蹈起來，他像瘋狂一般，在屋裏轉著，舞著，一面　著；原來他已閉在這間屋子裏整整六個年頭了！（這時已是一八六四年了）</p>
<p>諾貝爾的甘油火藥發明了，全世辦都震動起來，因為這東西的爆炸力比舊日的火藥不知要大到多少倍！瑞典政府特許他專利製造，並得到英德法各國政府的特別保障；於是諾貝爾的資產一天天積累起來，而世界上偉大的工程，也不知省了多少時間力氣，全世界誰不讚揚他的功勞呢！</p>
<p>但硝化甘油是液體，運輸起來極不方便而且危險，諾貝爾費了許多心思，又解決了這個難題，他將「砂藻土」與硝化甘油混合，成了一種柔軟的物體，這就是軍事有名的「猛炸藥」。後來他又發明了硝化火棉，是用棉花浸在硝酸中製成的，為一種膠狀物，其爆炸力比猛炸藥又大許多，故亦名「炸膠」（這是一八七八的事）這個也得到政府特許的專利權。</p>
<p>自諾貝爾的火藥發明以後，工業上的需用日繁，一八六七年，他只製了十一噸，一八七〇年就增刊到四二〇噸，一八七七年為五千五百噸，到一八八二年已到萬噸之數。諾貝爾自然是發了大財，且成了舉世知名的科學家。但有一件事，却使他極度苦痛，就是這本來給人類謀福利的火藥却漸漸移用到自相殘殺的戰爭上去！各國都在設法製造火藥，兵器也就改進了，總之，殺人的方法更迅速了，更經濟了，更殘毒了！這那裏是諾貝爾的本心呢？到他臨死時，很有些懺悔自己的罪惡，他有一千八百萬元的遺產，為了贖罪起見，全部都捐給國家，組織了一個諾貝爾財團來管理，將每年所得的利息，獎給各國對於物理，化學，生理學，或文學有貢獻的人。還有，致力於縮小軍備和世界和平的人，也有得獎金的資格，每門每年以一人為限，大約可得八萬元左右。這就是舉世注意的諾貝爾榮譽獎金了。</p>
<p>諾貝爾活到六十三歲，在抱著無窮的遺憾中死去了！</p>

<h3 id="c197">出版界的大變革 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 獨秀</p>
<p>—劃一全國書價—</p>
<p>出版界一方面是為了維持一部份人的生計，同時更担負起了一個部門，本來都可以「我為人人，人人為我」的八個字去解釋，不過，在比較性上，的確有其緩急輕重之別。譬如以出版界而論，不獨負有將前人的才智學識傳授給現代和將來的義務，而且還可以推動這時代的前進，發揚這文化的向上！</p>
<p>同時在這現社會的無論那一部門，都有著不合理的現象存在，這不合理的現象，對於某一部門的少數人也許有一點小小的利益，但對於大眾却是一各毒害。這種情形，普遍於這世界的每一個地方，每一個職業綫上，出版界當然不能例外。</p>
<p>唯某出版界之影響於人民太深刻，唯其出版界所負的使命太重大，因此，我們要求出版界之革除其不合理的現象，也愈迫切。敎育部之命令全國出版界劃一書目的意義，恐怕在此，而上海市書業同業公會首先奉令照辦，恐怕也在。</p>
<p>過去的出版業者，往往將書的定價很高，而折扣也很大，於是在最近市面上不景氣的時候，一折八扣的書籍，也就層出而不窮。在營書業者，可謂有虧商業道德，在購書者，當然很多上當之人，因此而呆滯了圖書的銷路，文化的餅鈕帶，也是意料中事。</p>
<p>現定於本年七月一日起，各書一律印明實價，廉價預約，也有一定的規定，從此以後，各書局旣可減除許多無謂的競爭，提高商業的道德，切實地為文化而服務，而一般讀者也不致有上當之虞。</p>
<p>這一個出版界空前的大變革，作者深信這是整個中國文化界開始大放異彩的前奏曲！</p>
<h3 id="c198">明日之康藏滇桂問題 <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 吳企雲</p>
<p>方秋董著　世界出版</p>
<p>我們在方秋葦先生著的「明日之康藏滇桂問題」一書的自序中，讀到了如下一段沉痛的自白「在九一八事變以前，我曾努力於東北問題的寫作，結果沒有人去注意牠；九一八事變以後，我又努力於華北問題的寫作，同樣地很少人去注意它；反之，對於我這個寫作注意的却在日本方面。…」一個比較有卓越眼光的研究者，他的勞作竟得不到一般人的注意，反爲友邦的日本所注意，所研究，這眞是一個最大的悲哀！</p>
<p>現在方秋葦先生的「明日之康藏滇桂問題」一書又完成了，假定該書還是得不到國人的注意，反給英法日俄諸國以爲參考之物，那麽永遠這樣糊塗下去，東北既失之於前，西南問題也可接踵於後，神州之陸沉，尚復何言？那麽著作者一個人的悲哀，猶其餘事了！</p>
<p>在中國的歷史上，對於邊疆各省，素取懷柔政策，祇要他們不叛離，不作亂，不反抗，而做到所謂「歲歲來朝年年進貢」的地步，也就心滿意足了。這一個政策，在閉關時代，原未可厚非，因為以中國疆土之廣，交通之不發達，敎育之不普及，民情風俗之不同，種族文字之歧異，要希望中央政府的權力直接達到邊遠各省份，原非事實所許可。但是這一個壞柔政策，以為一時權宜之計則可，以為萬世不變之策則不可；在閉關自守時代則可，到了現在則不可。康藏滇桂之所以佈滿了英法諸國的勢力，就是為了我國中央政府老是抱定懷柔政策的緣幫。（未完）</p>

<p>— 張天佑</p>
<p>楊幼炯　符　彪編　中華出版</p>
<p>人是政治的動物，這句說話，從國家成立以來，乃至無窮的將來，筆者敢肯定地說，決不會動搖它確立不易的定論的。因威望始終是一個社會的人，決不能離羣而索居，自己滿足自己的生活要求，因為生活是需要大眾的分工合作，於是國家於以成立，而政治也於焉產生。所以你喜歡政治也好，厭惡政治也好，這政治制度，總是在影響一般人的；這政治法令，永遠是支配一般人的。我國數千年來，在君主專制時代，一般自史記清高之土，往往以不預問政治為超脫，然而這一般厭惡政治的隱士，何嘗能逃免國家法定及政治制度的支配呢？為政治制度所統治而以不預問政治為清高，豈非滑稽之尤者。直到民國初期，汪精衛先生曾提出了所謂三不主義，「三不」中之「一不」，即為不做管，汪先生之所以不欲做民，無非表明清高而已，然而你不做官，袁世凱一系下之軍閥却要做官，結果因統治者之胡法妄為，還是要來一個討袁運動，到了民國十七年，汪先生還是祇有做官；這裏得特別說明，筆者之所謂干預政治，並不是說一定要做官才是干預政治；而中國過去一般清高之士之所謂不做官，即包括了不干預政治的全部意義，所以筆者認為汪先生在民國初期「不做官」即包括「不干預政治」之全部意義的口號，是有值得討論的餘地的。還有我們那位胡適博士，起初他也認為干預政治是不清高的事情，但是結果他說：「我要逃避政治，然而政治却時時刻刻跟隨著我，一步也不肯放鬆。」（大意是如此，原文不記得了。）到了最近兩三年來，胡適先生的政論時時刻刻地發表著，足見人到底是一個社會的動物，政治的動物啊！</p>
<p>過去國人所以不這種厭惡政治的怪現象，筆者以為可以分下列三點來說明；第一，政權和治權完全掌握在帝皇一人的手裏，皇帝的說話就是法律，就是命令，人民是不容置喙的；第二，仕途上奔競貪汚卑鄙齷齪之風，使一般潔身自好之士，望而却步，所以不願預問政治；第三，那時政府與人民的關係非常淺薄，除掉完糧納稅的義務以外，政治的好與壞簡直與一般安分守已的良民不會發生多大關係，所謂「天高皇帝遠」，誰管得了誰呢？</p>
<p>可是到了現在，社會生活日趨複雜，經濟發展日臻嚴密，敎育程度日益普遍而提高，民權思想更達到了天之涯海之角，政治與人民的關係當然不若過去專制時代的那麼淺薄了，於是一般人民之關心政治干預政治，正好像對於日常衣。</p>

<h3 id="c200">國聯中的一個困難問題 <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— 敬</p>
<p>現在攏在我們眼前的困難問題，要十倍百倍於國聯，然而置諸一邊不談，而去談絕不相關的國聯困難問題，去談他怎麽？不，這個國聯，我們也曾認爲是一個「有求必應」的大菩薩，自九一八後，也會經去請敎過，去懇求過，但是到底像去紅廟裏求籤一樣，抽着了一擋下下籤，此外絕對得不到一些甚麽影響</p>
<p>九一八之役，我們早已第一决認識了國聯，意阿之役，阿比西尼亞，也同樣地去「求籤問下」，到底「惟誠則靈」，居然求到了一個上上籤，得到不少的安慰，面子，但是阿國到底亡了，阿王也出奔了，這是我們第二决認識國聯，現在的國聯的困難問題，不是別的，便是意國侵阿的餘波，雖則餘波，然而處置這個問題，確是非常困難，問題是什麽？便是對意制裁是吾應當撤銷。</p>
<p>當意阿戰事發生之初，國聯卽議决認定意國爲侵略國，並議决應當對意制裁，與實施辦法，到現在阿國亡了，意國已宣布阿國爲意國的殖民地了，國聯的困難問題，便在這裏，欲制裁下去麽？恐引起未來的糾紛，欲撤銷制裁麽？於國聯的面子上，亦說不過去，這個問題，的確有研究的必要，的確有「好呌我左右爲人難」的痛苦。</p>
<p>這個問題，國聯無法解决，本想延宕下去，麻花榻煞，不料喜開玩笑的阿根廷，忽要求國聯，提早召集大會，阿根廷政府原與意國有密切關係，所以國聯議决制裁意國時，阿國並不熱烈，故現在要求國聯提早召集大會，亦是爲意國帮忙，或傳係意大利所間接發動，將來乘機催促撤消制裁的實現，也是可信，而意國一方面用宣傳方法，謂現行制裁辦法，若不能在六月十五日前，予以撤消，則意國卽當退出國聯，一方面則意國駐英大使格蘭第，去訪問外相艾登，作緩和兩國關係初步的工作，一硬一軟，威脅利誘，二者並進，的是外交的好手段。</p>
<p>然而英國呢？欲强硬到底，一則恐國聯就此壽終正寢，無法維持，二則恐惹起禍端，非同小可，實在硬不起來，故兩國確有成立諒解的可能性，卽撤消制裁辦法一問題，亦可獲得解决，至解决途徑爲何？據英國觀察報載稱，祇須將英意兩國，前於一九二五年十二月間所成立之協定，加以修改，（該協定規定，阿國西部査那湖一帶，爲英國勢力範圍，）並將恊定內所載阿比西尼亞國皇帝字樣，易以意國政府字樣，換言之，卽將英國政府所要求之讓與權，改由意國政府出面，自願給予英國而已。</p>
<p>若照這一段新聞觀之，英國也祇要得到阿國西部査那湖一帶爲英國的勢力範圍，卽可撤消制裁，如是，英國從前帮阿比西尼亞的忙，原來帮自己的忙，只要自己得到權利，和保全權利，其他的面子，亦可拋開不問，我從前認識的國聯，祇認爲「國聯無用論」罷了，現在認識的國聯，實是一個「分贓式」的國聯，以後弱小的國家，須大家覺悟，須努力自强，努力自救，國聯原是世界上的一種裝飾品，是一個漆黑一團的黑衙門。</p>
<h3 id="c201">馬的故事 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— 夏理斯</p>
<p>那一年我在馬來半島一帶流浪着；從這個都會到那個都會，有的時候簡直連吃一頓飯也成了問題，忍着飢在街頭　　。有一天實在餓得受不住了。在街上老是把貪婪的眼光看着每一家食品店的門口。鬼蜮而混賬的印度亞三開始注意我了，老不放鬆地追隨着我·這樣，我跨了小坡的那座橋，帶着惶恐的心走到荒野的地帶；抹抹頭上的汗，安定了一下，在一塊草地上躺了下去。</p>
<p>太陽很光亮，刺射着我的眼睛；疲倦到了極點，可是不能入睡。這樣躺了一刻，不知道什麽時候來了一匹馬，正在離我不遠的地方，垂下頭在吃草。四圍十分靜寂，牠嚼草的聲音淸晰地可以聽見；因此我又威到自己有一天不吃什麽了。就坐在那里默默地看着這匹馬；牠長得很健壯，而且營養邊一定不錯吧，不知道怎麽一來我向牠生了一絲羨慕的念頭。這時遠遠地有兩個人趕來了，顯然是找他們的的馬，一發現原來就在這里，就歡喜遠呌着：</p>
<p>「牠在這里呢！」</p>
<p>對於我，不知道出於怎樣的，忽然也表示了他們的好感。也許是以爲我替他們守住了這匹馬吧？看見了我的飢餓的樣子，他們把我和那匹馬一同帶了走。距離這草塲不遠，他們的馬房就可以看見了。由於他們的口談，我明白了這匹馬是在訓練中，三個月以後一定要讓牠出席馬來半島大競賽的。一路他們在談論到馬的各方面，然後忽然又問我要不要一個工作？在飢寒交迫中的我，那有不答應的呢？於是，第二天，我就做了馬房里打雜的小伙計。</p>
<p>在十幾匹馬中，我總有點徧愛那在草塲上相識的馬；牠的名宇呌做拿破崙·每天早上，我牽了拿破崙在外邊蹓躂，讓晨風吹着牠，太陽晒着牠。高突的時候牠就引頸畏嗚，頭上的棕髮披向兩邊，顯出一種威風。有一天主人看見了，就笑得嘴邊合不攏來地呌道：</p>
<p>「拿破崙，眞不壊呀！」</p>
<p>主人是英國鬼子，一副紳士的架子，拿着司的克，脖子上掛着望遠鏡。快近賽期了，他就把拿破崙帶到跑馬塲去，呌騎師跑給他看。於是他就拿出計時錶來，非常注意地看着。槍聲一放，拿破崙就往前跑；四脚下揚起塵灰，的達的達地響，繞着塲子飛奔。這時大家都很緊張，直到牠跑完了，主人雖然很滿意，但是仍舊照樣地可嚀着，呌我們好好地看護牠，加緊地訓練。一面他自己又在報紙上把拿破崙介紹出來，誇張着說今年一定是拿破崙的天下！</p>
<p>過兩天就是賽會的會期了。那天晚上起先是悶熱得很；半夜里下起滂沱的大雨來了。我看着拿破崙安靜下去以後，就在馬房的一角閉起眼睛休息。我還做夢呢，夢着拿破崙在馬來半島的比賽中得了第一，十萬人替牠喝采！可是，醒來以後，怎麼——</p>
<p>拿破崙不見啦！</p>
<p>是給人偸去了的。因爲那一般人畏忌拿破崙在賽會里要奪去他們的錦標，所以做了這樣的事。我們的主人念得只是咬着雪茄，但不點上火，把雪茄咬得碎以後，吐了一口涎沫到痰盂里去。他又打電話給警察署：「一定要把拿破崙在二十四小時內找回來！」他厲聲地吩咐。</p>
<p>自然，我是當天就給趕出了馬房。流浪挨餓的生活又回來了；然而我懐念着拿破崙。賽馬的一天我特地走到那擠着整千整萬人的跑馬廳去，想知道拿破崙的消息；可是我那襤樓的樣子又引起了印度亞三的干涉，不許我走近那入口處。這樣在震耳的喊聲中我站在外面，向一個人熱烈地間道：</p>
<p>「先生，拿破崙在不在跑呢？」</p>
<p>「沒有！華盛頓得到第一了。」這就是他的回答。</p>

<h3 id="c202">烟廠的一天 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 葉萊</p>
<p>七點鐘，太陽已爬進了我們的宿舍裏，從鋼窗望了出去，可以看到遼遠的一角，高高的烟筒又鮮明地轟立在我的眼前了　好多工廠都響着笛聲，嗚嗚——這聲音已催促着我了，我趕緊地洗了個臉，粘在黃黑色的臉上的油質怪粘膩的，好容易才洗　淸爽，可是，在這香烟製造所裹，整天整夜都沉鬱在烟味混着麻酒的氛圍裏，雖然，我並不是一個會抽香烟的人，我却變成一個染上了烟氣的魔鬼似的</p>
<p>這時候還沒有開始辦公，事實上是到了九點鐘才算是正式辦公的。我該做什麽呢？我是一個非常生疏的辦事員呀，於是，我像一個考察者似地在偌大的工廠裏跑一個圈兒，不過，我是很愛在早上，允其是沒有辦公以前的早上，有充分的時間到各門各部去觀察觀察的。不過，也許人家會說我是一個願意在女兒們的周圍活動的人吧，但是，我總是感到，當我跟她們接近的時候，心裏就浮起了一種秘隱的痛苦來了。</p>
<p>看啦，這廣大的工廠裏；一排一排的坐位展開者，這單是一個包烟部，就有千把　坐位了。當我跑進這充滿了光彩的工塲的時候　已經坐滿了的女兒們就吱吱喳喳地談着，笑着，她們還未有工作好做，這是習憤，她們每天早上都是這樣地恭候工作的，不過，這一千多個坐位，現在只不過容納了五百個女工吧了。而且，她們都不是長工的，做一天工就算一天的工錢，她們做滿了一天工，挺多也不過是二角錢吧了，她們跟我打比，眞有很大的差別哪，不過，我是十塊錢一個月的會計員，一天要做足了九小時的麻煩賬，跟那專領薪水不做事的大爺們打比，又有床地的隔別了。眞的，我每天早上到這兒來，心裏總是有點兒難過的。</p>
<p>四五百個女兒的年上，大都是打扮得很好看的，這，我有點兒不懂，她們縱使天天有工作做，從白天做到夜裏，甚至做滿了二十小時的工作，一個月挺多是拿八九塊洋錢吧了，她們還要吃，往，從那兒弄得這麽好看呢，染紅了的嘴唇，塗滿了香粉的臉孔，花花綠綠的衣裳，有時，三五成羣的混在一角談笑，你扯我推的，當然，如果管工來了，她們就像被什麽壓着一樣，沉默得連眉頭也皺緊了。</p>
<p>「喂！李先生，今天會開工的？」當我走進去的時候，她們就爭着的問，張大了希望的眼珠子，有一些還捧着碗冷飯，冷麵之類的東西喫着呢。</p>
<p>「會的，昨天才有人定了貨，今天明天都要趕工呢！」</p>
<p>我說着，透了一口氣的走過去，她們那吱吱喳喳的聲音，夾着歡笑又波動起來了，可是，我如果回答她們沒有工作的話，她們一定會悲哀地低下頭，透了一口氣的準備回家去了。</p>
<p>照例地，我走完了工廠的每一個部分，就回到辦公室去，跟着，工塲里每一個部分，就不停地播傳出那森隆轟隆的聲音，五六百工人就忙碌地，靜靜地在做他們的機械的工作了，我呢，不是依然一樣機械地，在做我那許多麻煩的賬目嗎？以前有十個會計人員，現在只有三個吧了，而且，有一個是年紀老勱的，他常常把數目弄得糊塗，又要求帮他們的忙，眞的，我差不多負起做這全工廠的會計工作啦，你想，我不是忙得氣也透不出來嗎？所以，我一上了辦公所，我的頭腦也不自由起來了。</p>
<p>午飯以後，我們就聽到一個焙房的工人病倒了，而月馬上就送到醫院去，聽說，他是患了腥紅急症的。不過，那個工人，我却聽到一點兒關於他的話。他是經山東流落在上海的人，沒有親族沒有朋友，一年前就到我們的工廠來做焙房的工作，這個身體强壯得好像老虎似的人，在經常都有一百二十度以上的熱度的焙房重，從白天到夜裏，老是呼吸着窒息的烟和麻酒的氣味，於是，一天一天地淸瘦，體弱，一直支持到今天就病倒了。可是，不一會兒，從醫院那里傳來的訊息，他是的確是患腥紅症死了，死了，這個可怕的印象就深刻地印在我的腦袋裹，我連打那百二十多度以上的焙房門前走過也沒有勇氣，然而，工人們沒有一點兒聲的，就用沉默敬答這個事實上爲工作而死的工友。</p>
<p>「我們照例是要送多少給工人的家屬的。」</p>
<p>經理機械地徵求各入的意思，可是，許多人都不響，沉默着。</p>
<p>「就送他五塊好了！」一個月薪二百元的不做事的大爺，不樂意地說了。</p>
<p>五元，我壓着沉痛的氣息，把數目記在每日的數自上。可是，另一方面呢，我却記着下面那許多的數目；</p>
<p>「×××爲某公事請宴，五十元。」</p>
<p>「×××五十元，×××汽車費六元。×××請客廿八元九角！」</p>
<p>「××公司追欠連利息共三千五百元。」</p>
<p>「××銀行追討抵押工廠之利息一萬二千元。」</p>
<p>我透了一口氣，腦袋却昏熱了起來了。</p>

<p>— 顧文宗作</p>
<p>驚鴻　證明這一件事，以經濟力和廣吿宣傳力的對比，那還不够，因爲廣吿；根本是誘惑購買的手叚，這是做生意招徠僱客；必要走的一條門路，凡是經濟力不充實的人，他們全會羨慕廣吿上形形色色；美不勝收的甜言蜜語的，那種美好動聽的廣吿術語，專門騙取的；就是那些家無恒產食圖便宜者的金錢，越是經濟力量薄弱的人，越要享受些價廉物美的各種物質，所以我說，廣吿是利誘購買力薄弱者的無上利器，沒有多少錢的人們，打算得到便宜貨的小市民們，往往會受了廣吿的支配的。</p>
<p>麗雅　但是廣吿的最大作用跟它的本意恐怕不祇是您可說的那樣卑鄱吧？</p>
<p>驚鴻　那是自然，我所說的，那是限於不忠實的宣傳，可是那些忠實的廣吿，現在早被那些無聊的廣吿，欺騙式的廣吿，吹牛性的廣吿，還有那些低級誘惑手叚的廣吿逼迫到毫無　力了！因此不忠實的廣吿，反而能够欺腞愚民，支配愚民。</p>
<p>麗雅　那麼剛才我吃的那個英國大菜，一定是廣吿性的大菜嘍？</p>
<p>驚鴻　只要那個大英；在你嘴裏發生了辨別滋味的效力，使那個大菜的廣吿，失去了欺騙的力量，那你就不是上當的一份子，照剛才你說的那麽津津有味，那就是廣吿的吹噓」戰勝了「購買者的辯別力」，購買者旣失去了「物質的鑑別」與「滋味的辯別」，那就是再壊的東西也成了極上品的東西了，</p>

<p>— 珍</p>
<p>在一年以前，華納公司的「仲夏夜之夢」攝竣了，本來好萊塢其他公司不管暗中正準備着攝製大批莎翁劇的，至此因鑒於華納之失敗，皆是途放棄了企劃。</p>
<p>向來以敢於大膽投資著名的米高梅公司，對於這却幷未感到膽怯，他們仍不願放棄了這條可以開闢的新路。於是决定了攝製一部「羅密歐與朱麗葉」的片子。</p>
<p>照豫算，這一部片子的化費將達至一百二十五萬元美金數額。</p>
<p>監製者特別注意於莎士比亞原著底對白，為求精密與眞確，他們曾搜遍了十八種不同的版本，最後，是决定了採用劍橋版的原書。</p>
<p>又為了要確實知道一四五年代佛朗那城的一切情况，本片的美術監督吉彭斯氏還派了兩位攝影師到這個意大利古城實地去觀察。他們一共去了三個月，拍了三千七百六十九張有關係的照片回來，由這些照片，他們製出了數十套的縮尺模型，然後再照着模型築成富麗偉大的攝影塲佈景。</p>
<p>一場佛朗那中央廣場的佈景足足估了八英畝。另一個大舞廳的橫端寬二進五十呎，長四百呎。加普利茲的花園也是同樣大，但看去比舞廳更寬廣的樣子。那個露台，羅密歐要從那滿佈着薔薇花的　根攀上去的露台（這在原著中是最醉人的場面之一）共有二十四呎高。</p>
<p>此片最大的耗費還是在演員的服裝上。全片男女演員有一千二百餘，而女的服裝較男的更麻煩得多；她們共穿去了二萬碼的綢布，而男的也化了一萬八千碼。羅密歐一件外套便去了九碼，但李斯廉霍華却曾穿了牠出場四次，終也算値得。</p>
<p>「羅密歐與朱麗葉」，慢啊瑙瑪希拉在這片中擔任女主角朱麗葉，這片不久就將在本埠上映了。牠是這兩年內第二部莎翁作品的電影化，總計在這兩部片子上，好萊塢為莎士比亞已付去了幾近三百萬金元了。</p>

<p>(Guangzhou) Gan Jiehou told a Reuters reporter today that the Japanese claim that the Southwest has declared war on the Central Government is absolutely false. This news originated from rumors that Bai Chongxi had arrived in Guangzhou and that the Guangdong army had been mobilized. In fact, Bai has not arrived in Guangdong, and no mobilization order has been issued to the Guangdong army. Gan also stated that Guangdong's proposal is aimed at logically eliminating the possibility of civil war in China. (Reuters dispatch of the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Today, many newspaper reporters gathered at the Municipal Government to request a meeting with Mayor Xiao. Xiao later came out and stated that rumors that Ming Qu had gone to Peiping were untrue. However, he declined to answer any politically charged questions raised by the newspaper reporters. (Reuters dispatch of the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Xiao Zhenying left for Peiping by train on the evening of the 3rd to meet with Song. Many rumors persist in Tianjin. Xiao stated that there would not be any serious changes in diplomacy. The bombing of the Beining Railway is under investigation. Apprehending the perpetrators is difficult, but it should not involve too many parties. The Japanese side's views are still unclear. I will stay in Peiping for a few days and then return soon. Many rumors are circulating, and there is no way to stop them; we can only let them live and die on their own.

<p>(Tokyo) The British Ambassador to Japan, Clive, visited Foreign Minister Arita at the Foreign Ministry at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd, holding talks for about an hour. According to the authorities, the content of the talks between the British Ambassador and the Foreign Minister only concerned the issue of Rose's visit to Japan. However, Rose's decision to visit Japan is the result of a decision by the British and Japanese governments. Therefore, the meeting between the British Ambassador and the Foreign Minister must have touched on issues such as measures to aid friendly nations, protect British interests in China, and Anglo-Japanese cooperation towards China. (Domei News Agency dispatch of the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Military Attaché Kita in China is scheduled to visit key figures in the Chinese government in the coming days to inquire about the degree of their attitude towards Japan. After receiving Kita's report, the central government will closely review the attitude and movements of the Chinese government, and listen to the opinions of Consul General Suma and Ambassador Kawagoe. The relevant authorities will discuss countermeasures, demanding that the Chinese government crack down on anti-Japanese elements, sweep away the root causes that hinder the adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations, and strive to achieve coexistence and co-prosperity. Former Commander of the China Garrison Army, Lieutenant General Tada, plans to visit the Army authorities in the coming days to offer important opinions on China. Important diplomatic negotiations between China and Japan are certain to unfold when Ambassador Kawagoe takes office. (Domei News Agency dispatch of the 3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e4">Beining Railway Authorities Investigate Bombing Case <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Director and Deputy Director of the Beining Railway Bureau and others went to the site of the bombing case on the Beining Railway last Friday night to investigate. The development of this case depends entirely on the attitude of the Japanese military authorities. After the bombing occurred, two guards of the railway were arrested and taken away by Japanese soldiers and have not yet been released. (Reuters dispatch of the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Chen Juesheng, along with Deputy Director Xu Chengyu and the heads of the Car and Locomotive Departments, took a special train to the vicinity of Zhangguizhuang at noon on the 3rd to inspect the site of the railway bombing on the 29th. The urgency and seriousness of this matter still lies with the Japanese side. The situation is not yet optimistic. The Tianjin Municipal Railway Public Security authorities are making every effort to search for the perpetrators, but there are many doubts as to whether this was done by Chinese. (Special dispatch of the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Regarding the bombing of the Beining Railway on the night of the 29th, according to the report of Section Chief Mu of the 3rd Section of the Railway Police and the investigation and confirmation by the authorities, the incident occurred at 7:00 PM on the night of the 29th. After the No. 24 train from Tanggu to Jinzhou arrived in Tianjin, someone placed explosives under the tracks 8 kilometers away from Tianjin, connecting them with iron wire. Due to the urgency and lack of complete technical preparation, the explosives were buried very shallowly. At 8:02 PM, when the 3rd Japanese military train passed the site from Tanggu to Tianjin, an explosion occurred, causing the bottom compartment and roof of the last car to bulge. Three war horses were slightly injured. At the time, the railway police inspected the road and saw smoke and dust rising in the distance, suspecting that soldiers inside the car were firing outwards. At 9:00 PM, they changed shifts and instructed the incoming officers and police to pay attention. At 10:10 PM, the Japanese requested a special train from Tianjin and instructed the driver to drive at the usual speed. Eight minutes later, they stopped because the Japanese knew the location of the explosion. At 8:20 PM, ten minutes before the military train arrived in Tianjin, they specially drove at the usual speed to find the bombing site. However, the special train was eight minutes faster than the military train and passed the bombing site, reaching Bridge No. 14 in Zhangguizhuang. The Japanese soldiers ordered the train to stop and got out of the car to inspect, discovering traces of the bombing at the joints of steel rails Nos. 14 and 15. They then sent military police to guard the site. At 11:45 PM, the railway police inspected the road and discovered the incident. The Railway Bureau received the report at 0:30 AM.

<p>Ansel Consults in Tianjin on Smuggling Suppression</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance believes that customs smuggling suppression has often relied on informant reports, leading to successful seizures. In order to promote smuggling suppression and encourage reporting, the following supplementary measures are hereby formulated:</p>
<p>*   Confidential report boxes shall be set up at customs offices and branch offices and cards, allowing ordinary merchants and civilians to submit written reports regarding smuggling, illicit sales, and concealment.</p>
<p>*   In addition to stating the specific facts of smuggling, illicit sales, and concealment, as well as the names and addresses of the perpetrators or stores and factories, the report must also include the name and address of the informant.</p>
<p>*   Customs offices, branch offices, and cards shall maintain absolute confidentiality regarding the identity of the informant.</p>
<p>*   In addition to submitting written reports, informants may also, as usual, personally go to the customs office, branch office, card, or local military police to make verbal reports.</p>
<p>*   If there is no confidential report box nearby, informants may send telegrams or postal parcels to the customs office or card to make a report.</p>
<p>*   Written reports shall be opened personally by the responsible personnel of the customs office or branch office or card. When necessary, the informant may be secretly invited for questioning at any time, or accompany the authorities to the location indicated to investigate and seize smuggled goods.</p>
<p>*   For smuggled goods obtained as a result of a report, after processing by the customs office or card, the informant shall be rewarded according to the newly established informant reward measures. (Central News Agency dispatch of the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Ansel visited Tax Commissioner Hillier and Chen Juesheng again on the 3rd to consult on smuggling suppression matters, and it was decided that he would return south on the 5th to report. Whether a special investigation office should be set up in Tianjin awaits the decision of the Ministry of Finance. Ansel believes that the situation in North China is special and will suggest to the Ministry that a special investigation office not be established, but that a few responsible customs officials be added to assist the customs smuggling suppression section in handling everything.

<p>(Zhenjiang) 120 bags of smuggled sugar shipped by Changzhou Gongsheng Warehouse were investigated and handled by county officials.

After receiving the report, the provincial government sent a telegram to the county magistrate instructing him to hand over the smuggled sugar and the apprehended suspects to the customs for separate handling, and requested the Zhenhai Customs to send personnel to Changzhou to investigate and authenticate.

<p>Oppressing China and Protecting Smuggling</p>
<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian commented today on the recent bombing case on the Beining Railway, saying that anyone familiar with Japan's methods would not be surprised by an unexpected event that is followed by a request, which is tantamount to having a cause without a result. Initially, everyone expected Japan to impose new oppression, but it has not been realized, perhaps only delayed. The newspaper also commented on the smuggling of goods from the Japanese-controlled Eastern Hebei Autonomous Region into China, saying that its extent is appalling. Although Japan has so far responded to protests with evasions and various excuses, its responsibility is clear. Without Japan's protection, smuggling would be impossible. (Reuters dispatch of the 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) The Financial News stated that the overall situation in the Far East is becoming increasingly chaotic. In recent weeks, rumors have spread that Japan intends to penetrate deeper into Chinese territory. Soviet military preparations are becoming increasingly solid, clearly intended to resist any aggression. Japan may therefore abandon its long-standing ambition to seize the port of Vladivostok and turn south to invade China. (Reuters dispatch of the 3rd)</p>
<p>(New York) A Washington Post editorial on the 30th stated that smuggling in North China not only affects Chinese tax revenue but also deals a death blow to British and American trade. If Japan wants to stop the rampant smuggling, it is a matter of simply raising a hand. However, Japan not only refuses to do so, but also increases its military preparations. Japanese redundant personnel not only refuse to cooperate with China, but also try to undermine the Open Door Policy, which has been repeatedly solemnly declared to be guaranteed by Japan, which is clearly a complete violation. These actions are nothing more than an attempt to force China to submit in order to achieve the recognition of "Manchukuo," the revision of import tariffs, the acceptance of Japanese privileges in North China, and the abandonment of maintaining an independent monetary system in favor of linking up with Japan's.

<p>And States That Japan Must Also Strengthen Its Military Preparations</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Minister of the Army Terauchi, in response to questions from the Privy Council at the Privy Council's main meeting, explained the following key points: The Soviet Union's military preparations on the Soviet-Manchurian border, taking the Manchurian Incident as a wedge, have gradually become active. Countless solid forts have been built along the border line, and frontline defenses have been strengthened. At the same time, the organization of the Far East Red Army has been reformed and strengthened, new weapons have been used, equipment has been renewed, and preparations have been made for wartime. An active offensive stance is being taken against Japan and Manchuria. With the outbreak of the North China Incident last year, military preparations on the border of Outer Mongolia have been further enhanced and strengthened, intending to threaten "Manchukuo" from the east, west, and north. Therefore, Japan also needs to strengthen its military preparations. (Domei News Agency dispatch)</p>

<p>(Peiping) A Reuters reporter learned today from the British Embassy that with regard to the death of Japanese military officer Sasaki, which is said to be due to an assault by British Embassy guards, the British authorities immediately thoroughly investigated the actions of British soldiers and determined that all British soldiers in Peiping had returned to the camp long before the incident occurred. As for the piece of torn cloth found next to the deceased's body, which was said to be the same material as British soldiers' uniforms, the British authorities carefully examined the clothing of each soldier and found that none of them were damaged. Furthermore, the material of the cloth is not similar to that of British soldiers' uniforms. However, the British Embassy has notified the Japanese Embassy that if further evidence is presented regarding this case, the British authorities are willing to continue the investigation.

The person in charge admitted that the company's business situation this year is worse than before, but said that the seven ships mainly transport soybean cake and have not been affected by smuggling.

<h3 id="e14">Eradicating National Illiteracy <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— Dou</p>
<p>Since human affairs become increasingly complex and writing becomes increasingly important, whether to express ideas internally or to understand knowledge externally, almost all rely on it for communication. Today, as we pool national strength to seek overall development, it is essential to have a universal and profound influence. Observing the movement to promote wisdom within the country, we can only be somewhat optimistic in very limited cities. Most rural and remote areas are filled with ignorant people who do not understand the Qin and Han dynasties, let alone the Wei and Jin dynasties. If we want to popularize education and give everyone a drive, how can we succeed? I recently heard that the Ministry of Education has made a decision to eradicate national illiteracy and is currently drafting measures to promote mass education in the responsible department, aiming to eliminate 200 million illiterate people within six years, establish a foundation for education, and promote social progress. This sound in the empty mountains is cause for excitement.</p>
<p>In recent years, the authorities have also been working hard on education. They have put their heart and soul into compulsory education, used radio broadcasting for propaganda, and simultaneously planned for both free education and special education, which were widely promoted for a time. However, due to frequent disasters and disturbances in recent years, they have not been able to achieve significant results. Now, with the call for a six-year plan, we see the authorities' determination to eradicate illiteracy. With my limited ability, I dare to offer a humble suggestion.</p>
<p>Eradicating illiteracy is not easy to achieve quickly, given the vast area of our country and the prevalence of illiteracy. If the authorities are determined and can formulate a detailed plan, there should be no worries about the implementation process. The lack of talent is not a problem; while illiterate people are everywhere in the country today, there is also a significant surplus of wandering and displaced intellectuals. We should know that there are many knowledgeable people in the unemployment environment, either wandering due to unfavorable circumstances or being rejected due to a lack of support. There are also those who were originally teachers but were dismissed due to a lack of qualifications or were eliminated due to overly strict screening. We can be inclusive and recruit them all, provide them with the necessary training, and offer them reasonable financial assistance. We can then send them to the countryside to promote the work of eradicating illiteracy. As for the materials used, we should consider the situation and specially compile them, striving to adapt them to the needs of the rural people and focusing on being able to attract their interest. Furthermore, we should assign those with eloquence and quick wit among the staff to be responsible for public speaking, and those with skilled writing to be responsible for writing. Local educational institutions should supervise the progress at all times, assess the results, and impose rewards and punishments accordingly. In this way, on the one hand, we can provide intellectual relief, and on the other hand, we can also alleviate occupational hunger. Those who are concerned should not dismiss these words as irrelevant.</p>
<p>What must be done in conjunction with this is to increase the number of newspapers and posters and create more pictorial propaganda. We can instruct the staff to explain their meaning in simple terms. At the same time, we can consult with those who perform low-level entertainment arts, such as storytellers, to help instill knowledge. We can distribute simple explanations of the text when they tell stories to induce a desire for knowledge, which may have considerable effects. The main thing is that things depend on people, and with determination, we can achieve success. Whether we can succeed in eradicating illiteracy depends on the authorities' determination.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Statistics on Opium Smokers in Wuhan <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>(Hankou) Since the Wuhan Public Security Bureau took over the ban on opium smoking last July, due to the lack of cooperation between the special zone and the French concessions, only 11,434 opium smokers have been registered and 2,012 opium smokers have been persuaded to quit so far. Furthermore, due to the difficulty in funding for only one municipal hospital as a smoking cessation institution, it is impossible to accommodate opium smokers as much as possible. Now, a part of the prison building has been borrowed from the Second Prison, which can accommodate 500 people. It is reported that the Public Security Bureau, in order to make the reporting of opium smokers more thorough, will add female staff to assist in strict investigations to prevent private smoking.

<h3 id="e17">Anti-Opium Director-General's Office Holds 6/3 Commemoration <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Anti-Opium Director-General's Office held a 6/3 Commemoration Meeting at the Lihsheshe at 9:30 AM on the 3rd. The event was attended by over 400 people, including anti-opium committee members Gan Naiguang, Lü Xinchou, Zhang Boling, Zhang Yuanshan, Li Zhonggong, Li Jihong, and representatives from various agencies, including Lü Chao, Liu Ruiheng, Chen Shuru, Jiao Yitang, and Wang Yongbin. After the ceremony, Gan Naiguang, representing Director-General Jiang, presided over the meeting and delivered a speech, and read Director-General Jiang's instructions. Subsequently, Li Shengong reported on the anti-opium situation, followed by a speech by Lü Chao, who stated that our country had suffered from imperialist oppression in the past, and that the scourge continues unabated today, which is truly heartbreaking. Now, Director-General Jiang, based on Premier Sun’s anti-drug instructions and the Central Committee's resolution, is determined to strictly prohibit opium and drugs. If this is achieved, the opium disaster of more than 200 years can be eradicated. Only with a strong body can the whole nation have the ability to resist, and the nation can be revived. Finally, Zhang Boling gave a speech, detailing the determination of our country's anti-drug movement in the past and the reasons for its subsequent failure. In the face of the laxity of the anti-opium administration, Director-General Jiang resolutely shouldered the responsibility of eradicating opium and drugs. The results of the past seven months have been astonishing. Mr. Jiang is using this educational approach to transform the country and revive the nation, and the country's future is expected to be bright. The meeting adjourned at 11:00 AM.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Original Text of Director-General Jiang's Instructions <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Today, we commemorate the day 97 years ago when our anti-opium sage, Lin Wenzhong, burned opium at Humen. When we recall Lin Gong's fearless spirit and unyielding perseverance on that day, we truly feel infinite admiration, and at the same time, we cannot help but feel infinite shame. Our sages, in order to protect the health and survival of the nation, did not hesitate to make any sacrifices to resist the import of foreign opium. Unexpectedly, in the decades since then, the spread of the opium scourge has become increasingly serious. We descendants have truly let down our sages too much. Opium is enough to harm individual health, affect social livelihood, shake the foundation of the country, and hinder the culture of the nation. The severity of the disaster is chilling. Lin Gong's instructions say, "The poison of opium is even worse than floods and wild beasts. There is no one in the world who does not think that opium must be prohibited. If this disaster is not eradicated, there will be no usable soldiers and no funds to be raised in ten years." These are truly accurate words. In history, we can see many precedents. The demise of a nation is often not simply caused by the conquest of another nation with military or political power, but by the degeneration and corruption of the nation itself. Conversely, any foreign aggression and oppression, for a nation with latent power that can strive to become strong, can only be regarded as a temporary blow. No matter how devastated it is, this nation will eventually be able to recover. Therefore, I feel that the danger of opium far outweighs foreign aggression. Whether our nation can be revived depends on whether we can make a great determination, invigorate our spirit, improve our internal affairs, and strengthen our national power. The most important thing is whether we can eradicate the scourge of opium and drugs. In recent years, while suppressing bandits, Zhongzheng has witnessed the widespread and profound suffering of our nation from the scourge of opium and drugs. If this continues, it will not only lead to national ruin but also to the extinction of the race. Therefore, I have made the greatest determination to eliminate this cruel and poisonous harm and have established a plan for a two-year ban on drugs and a six-year ban on opium, and have formulated various regulations to be implemented separately. Since the Central Government has specially granted me authority and responsibility, I have been working diligently every day, deeply fearing that I will not be able to implement it effectively and live up to the expectations of the Central Government and the people. Now, the anti-opium branches in the various provinces and cities have been established one after another, and more than 1.56 million opium addicts have been registered. Examining the actual results, we cannot say that there has been no progress, but in the end, it has not achieved the expected results according to the original plan. The crux of the problem, as I see it, is generally no more than the following: First, there is a lack of firm confidence. Because the prohibition of opium has never been thoroughly achieved throughout history, especially during the warlord era, the so-called prohibition of opium was nothing more than a policy of exploiting the people, and those who handled anti-opium affairs were all engaged in private gain and corruption, causing the general public to be unable to restore their confidence in the government's anti-opium policy for a time. They always thought that the government was simply "collecting taxes under the guise of prohibition" to collect money. Even the civil affairs officials at all levels also harbor the idea of ​​wait-and-see, thinking that it is impossible to eliminate opium and failing to earnestly implement the laws and regulations promulgated by the government. This is really an absolutely unacceptable wrong mentality. If this wrong mentality cannot be broken, the prohibition of opium will never succeed. I have repeatedly stated that the government will never compromise or surrender to the evil forces of opium and that the policy of banning it within a limited time will not be changed in the slightest. The government absolutely has no intention of "collecting taxes under the guise of prohibition" to extend the period of taxation to seek any financial benefits. In the past year or so, the majority of the people have indeed recognized the government's determination to implement the policy. If there are still a few people who are waiting and watching, then it is tantamount to willingly ruining themselves. They should wake up as soon as possible so as not to regret it too late. Second, there is a lack of a practical and hard-working spirit. In the past, the agencies that were in charge of anti-opium efforts were mostly nominal or started out strictly and then became lax, so there were no achievements to speak of. When Chinese people do things and cannot get through, they always like to blame it on the difficult environment. In fact, this is precisely to prove that they themselves do not have the power to transform the environment and overcome difficulties, but are succumbed to the environment. For example, when people with power and influence violate the prohibition orders, anti-opium administrative personnel are often intimidated by their power and influence and are unable to do anything, so they simply muddle along. As a result, they can neither prohibit officials nor prohibit the people, so they have to withdraw and become prisoners of opium. If our future prohibition of opium is still the same as before, with the constant excuse of a difficult environment and the inability to be determined to fight to the end without surrendering, then there is no way to do anything. I believe that there are absolutely no difficulties that cannot be solved in the world, nor are there absolutely no obstacles that cannot be overcome. One point of effort will lead to one point of success. The so-called "sincerity can move mountains," we should take this sentence as our belief. Third, there is a lack of a spirit of cooperation. We know that any social problem is not isolated or one-sided, but is related to the entire society. The opium problem is certainly no exception. If we examine the reasons why ordinary people smoke opium, they are generally no more than the following: 1. The poor social health environment. 2. Using opium as a medicine. 3. Work conditions are too harsh. 4. Curiosity or being seduced by others. In detail analysis, it is related to all aspects of society. Therefore, the prohibition of opium is definitely not a successful effort by partial or one-sided efforts. The entire society must be mobilized, cooperate with each other, and work together firmly towards a common goal in order to achieve results. Moreover, if all sectors of our society, including education, politics, health, and charity, work together unanimously, we can not only ban it within a limited time, but we will certainly be able to ban it ahead of schedule. I believe that only the total power of society is the key to determining everything's success or failure. In short, the most important meaning of commemorating our anti-opium sages here today is to examine our past mistakes, to emulate Lin Gong's spirit of practical and hard work and unyielding efforts, and to hope that the people of the whole country will work together to fight this evil force to the death and achieve the goal. Finally, I cannot but solemnly mention that the future of opium prohibition in China also depends on international cooperation. Because the organizations that illegally sell opium and drugs can exist behind China's territory, which the Chinese government cannot do anything about. This difficult situation is not shared by other countries. If foreign opium and drugs continue to be imported into China, all our efforts and sacrifices will be in vain. I sincerely hope that the friendly countries will not adopt the 90-year-old poisonous policy that the British government has already abandoned towards China, so as to cause this unfortunate phenomenon and increase the reasons for misunderstanding between each other.

<p>(Hankou) Recently, rumors of people being harmed by poison needles have spread too quickly in Hankou, affecting social order significantly. The reporter asked Chen Xizeng, director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, about this matter. According to him, the Hankou Second Branch Bureau recently had a case in which a habitual thief attempted to seize the belongings of a child, Hong Xueqin. Hong Xueqin was young and, upon hearing what his relative had said about the recent rumors of people being stabbed by poison needles, suddenly felt numb due to psychological stimulation. After investigation by the Second Branch Bureau, the original cause was determined to be completely untrue. On the 3rd, the Seventh Branch Bureau also had a similar misunderstanding. After repeated consideration by the bureau and based on his own practical investigation, it was learned that the origin of these rumors was that someone had widely posted advertisements on the walls of various streets, with words stating secret recipes for preventing poison needles. The ignorant men and women in society did not understand and thought that it was true. Currently, in addition to dispelling the rumors, the bureau will issue a notice on the 4th, strictly prohibiting these rumors. If anyone is found to be creating rumors under this pretext, they will be reported to the superiors for strict punishment by military law. (Central News Agency dispatch, 3rd)</p>

<p>Increased Purchasing Power of the Chinese People Benefits Britain, America, and Japan</p>
<p>Kobe – Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, economic advisor to the British government, accompanied by his wife and secretary, arrived in Kobe port aboard a Canadian vessel at 4 PM on the 2nd, for another visit to Japan. He told reporters on the ship that the purpose of this visit was to further discuss matters from last year's trip to China, where he had extensive talks with Japanese authorities, but some issues remained unresolved. He plans to meet with Foreign Minister Arita and two or three other key figures in Tokyo. However, he emphasized that his trip to China was not as a political advisor but as an economic advisor, allowing him to adjust the interests between Japan and China, and Japan and Britain from a third-party perspective. Regarding the economic and financial reconstruction of China, he believes it can be achieved with Japan's cooperation. He noted that the recent currency reform in China did not link the Chinese currency to the British pound or US dollar, so as long as the Chinese currency is stable, it will not be affected by fluctuations in the British pound or US dollar. If China's currency reform can stabilize the Chinese currency, it will benefit Britain, America, and Japan. In short, providing the Chinese people with sufficient purchasing power will undoubtedly create a vast new market. He has several trial proposals for this, but because they are trial proposals, he cannot disclose them. (3rd, Domei News Agency)</p>

<h3 id="e65">Argentina Formally Requests Early Convening of the League of Nations Assembly to Handle the Italo-Abyssinian Crisis and Reform Issues; Roughly Expected to be Convened on the 23rd of this Month <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) Argentina is strongly opposed to Italy's annexation of Abyssinia and recently made a verbal request for the League of Nations Assembly to convene an emergency meeting to consider sanctions against Italy. Today, it sent a diplomatic note to the League of Nations Secretariat, reiterating this proposal. In addition to sanctions, Argentina also requests consideration of: 1. The situation arising from the annexation of Abyssinia. 2. Reform of the League of Nations. Argentina suggests that the League of Nations Assembly should be convened around June 16th, and the member states of the League of Nations should deal with the new situation created by the annexation. After receiving this diplomatic note, the League of Nations Secretariat immediately notified the Chairman of the Assembly, Dr. Benes, who must consult with the Chairman of the League of Nations Executive Council, British Foreign Secretary Eden, and others before a date can be selected for the Assembly to convene. It is reported that other Latin American countries have agreed to support Argentina's proposal not to recognize Italy's annexation of Abyssinia. (3rd, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Argentine representative to the League of Nations, Mr. Genochio, visited League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol at half past six in the afternoon, where he formally presented a note requesting the early convening of the Assembly. The contents of the note had been previously notified to representatives of South American countries. The note stated that the Executive Council had previously decided on the 12th of last month to postpone the discussion of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute until the 16th of this month. At that time, the Argentine representative had already submitted a reservation. It was also stated that the League of Nations is based on the principle of equality. Therefore, important issues such as the Italo-Abyssinian dispute should be discussed jointly by all member states. "The government of our country now believes that the League of Nations should discuss the situation caused by Italy's annexation of Abyssinia and the implementation of sanctions and therefore applies to call the assembly early." Avenol, after receiving the note, is scheduled to discuss the matter with the current chairman of the Assembly, Czech President Benes, and the current chairman of the Executive Council, British Foreign Secretary Eden, tomorrow. He will also make informal contacts with other governments in order to decide whether the Assembly should be convened earlier. According to League of Nations personnel, Argentina's request should be accepted by the League of Nations. According to this agency's diplomatic correspondent, the Assembly will most likely be convened early on the 23rd of this month, and the extraordinary meeting of the Executive Council will also be postponed to that day. League of Nations personnel commented on the note submitted by Argentina, saying that it is based on the spirit of democracy of the League of Nations and has sufficient reason. Because the League of Nations Assembly includes all member states, large and small, on an equal footing, its method is the most democratic in all the activities of the League of Nations. Argentina also repeatedly cited Article 10 of the Covenant in the note and the principle of not recognizing land seized by force. The former stipulates that the territorial integrity of the member states of the League of Nations should be respected and maintained, and the latter is a principle consistently supported by the countries of South America. In addition, it is also worth noting that the word "annexation" is deliberately used in the note. In Italy's formal declarations, it has always tried to avoid using this term. (2nd, Havas)</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Eden received Argentine Ambassador Mabrun today in the afternoon to discuss the country's request to call the League of Nations assembly earlier. However, the talks were purely informal in nature, so Foreign Secretary Eden did not formally express the British government's views to the Argentine Ambassador. Political figures said that the British government did not advocate an earlier convening of the League of Nations Assembly, but if Argentina's request is supported by other countries, Britain would have no objections.

<p>(London) The Emperor of Abyssinia, aboard the British mail ship "Oxford," received an interview from a reporter from the Daily Telegraph. The reporter asked if he was preparing to go to Geneva to personally attend the League of Nations meeting to defend Abyssinia's position. The Emperor replied, "Everything must wait until after arriving in England to be decided. We are eager to contact the authorities of various European countries to understand their attitudes towards our position. The people of the Ethiopian Empire have repeatedly expressed their trust in the League of Nations and their emphasis on the moral value of the Covenant. We will certainly adhere to the resolutions passed by the League of Nations, striving for their continued implementation, and the Covenant of the League of Nations must be respected. We deeply believe that the Italo-Ethiopian dispute should be resolved based on justice. Although Italy has occupied Abyssinia by force, it has been judged by the League of Nations as an aggressor, and its actions cannot be recognized. Abyssinia still exists in law, and the southwestern part of Abyssinia still has a government in practice, which continues to handle state affairs under my command before I leave the country. In terms of war, if the enemy troops had followed the laws of war, the outcome would not be certain to this day, because our army fought bravely and repeatedly defeated strong enemies, until the Italian army used poison gas, our army began to falter, therefore we will never admit defeat." (Havas News Agency dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) The Emperor of Abyssinia departed from the Port of Gibraltar for England. It is estimated that he will arrive here in the afternoon of tomorrow. His residence has been chosen opposite Hyde Park, namely the mansion of Shanghai tycoon Sir Victor Sassoon. The Emperor's visit is of a private nature, so the authorities do not intend to officially send guards to protect him, but the Emperor will spend funds to hire several police officers to provide constant protection. A joint conference of British organizations supporting the League of Nations will hold a large-scale meeting in "Albert Hall" here in the coming days to discuss the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. It is rumored that the Emperor will be invited to attend and deliver a speech, but confirmation is awaited. (Havas dispatch, 2nd)</p>

<h3 id="e74">French Labor Strikes Expand <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Strikers in More Than Two Hundred Factories</p>
<p>(Paris) The number of factories affected by the labor strikes in the capital area has reached more than two hundred and thirty, including metallurgical plants, aircraft manufacturing plants, chemical food plants, and gas plants. The number of striking workers occupying factory buildings has reached more than 100,000. In addition, one hundred and twenty-eight workers at famous swimming pools and dance halls also went on strike to protest increased taxes. Moreover, labor strikes in the provinces are now more serious, with more than 10,000 striking workers, especially in the northern industrial area. For example, 1,150 workers at the Peugeot car factory and 1,000 workers at the Achiet electrical plant went on strike this morning and occupied the factory buildings. (Havas dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) The movement of striking by staying in the factory but not working is now spreading like wildfire. After the strikers in the machine industry achieved their demands, other industries followed suit one after another, and the speed was amazing. It is reported that there are more than 70 strikers in the bus company. At the same time, many large factories such as Citroen and the Nieport aircraft factory have returned to work as usual. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) The metallurgical industry strike, which had shown signs of ending quickly yesterday, suddenly took a turn for the worse today. The factory buildings of seventy factories are still occupied by strikers who refuse to leave. In addition, the strike situation in various chemical factories and food factories has also worsened. Previously, the strike was only limited to the capital area, but now it has spread to other areas in the suburbs. Even workers in the provinces have started to follow suit, especially in the northern industrial cities, such as Lille and Valenciennes. Although some factories in the metallurgical industry in the capital area have returned to work as usual, all the workers are still restless. For example, workers at the Renault car factory held many demonstrations, and workers at the Caudron aircraft factory stopped working again shortly after resuming work. Capitalists now believe that the strike no longer has an occupational nature, but has a political meaning. This can be seen from the fact that some of the strike leaders are not employees of the factory. Therefore, the joint meeting of labor and capital in the metallurgical industry is experiencing difficulties, and it is doubtful whether the union representatives can sign the work contract with the workers as scheduled (previously said it could be signed tomorrow). Some strikers have arbitrarily detained the managers of the factories. Premier Sarraut has received reports of this situation and immediately summoned union representatives to order them to take necessary measures immediately to stop it. The representatives have agreed to do so. (Havas dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Paris) The striking workers in the metallurgical industry in the capital area are still occupying the factory buildings and refusing to leave. The unions recently issued a statement explaining the reasons, stating that there are a total of 250,000 workers in the metallurgical industry. The capitalists have only accepted the demands put forward by 100,000 workers, and the remaining 150,000 are still disappointed. Once these people are satisfied, the strike will naturally end. As for the workers in other industries, they have joined the strike because their wages are too low. (Havas dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e75">New French Cabinet Personnel <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>There will be Two Women</p>
<p>(Paris) Socialist leader Blum is now organizing a new government according to completely new principles. According to responsible sources today, the personnel of the new government will be divided into three categories: cabinet members, state members, and deputy state members. The main personnel who have been internally determined are: Foreign Minister Delbos, Army Minister Lyautey, Defense Minister Daladier, and Finance Minister Auriol. There will be two women in the new government, which is an innovation: one is Mrs. Lacore, who will serve as Deputy State Member for Children's Welfare, and the other is Mrs. Joliot-Curie, the daughter of the famous scientist Marie Curie, who discovered radium, who will serve as Deputy State Member for Scientific Exploration. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the candidates for the new cabinet members, the gist has been recorded in yesterday's telegram. The news that was revealed in the lounge of the Chamber of Deputies this afternoon is exactly the same as what our reporter has learned. There is no change in the candidates for all important cabinet members. The only differences are the following: Yesterday's telegram said that the three departments of the Navy, Army, and Air Force will be merged into the Ministry of National Defense, with three chiefs in charge of naval, army, and air force affairs, respectively. Now it is learned that the six departments of the Navy, Army, Aviation, Agriculture, Posts and Telecommunications, and Merchant Marine have all been changed to directorates, each with a director, but no chief. The position of Director of the Navy Directorate, which yesterday's telegram intended to be filled by Congressman Campinchi, is now known to be filled by Congressman Holion, a radical socialist. The position of Chief of Overseas Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which yesterday's telegram intended to be selected from Congressman Tedsang of the Radical Socialist Party and Congressman Moch of the Socialist Party, is now known to be filled by Congressman Modet of the Socialist Party. Yesterday's telegram said that Mrs. Lecare will be the Chief of the Ministry of Agriculture. It is now known that she will be changed to the Director of the Ministry of Public Health. Originally, Mr. Umbrum intended to appoint Mrs. Joliot-Curie (the daughter of Marie Curie, the inventor of radium) as the Director of the Ministry of Public Health, but she firmly declined the position, so Mrs. Lecare was appointed instead. The candidates for the ministers of the newly established Ministry of National Solidarity and the Ministry of National Economy are unknown. In addition, the Daily News recently criticized the structure of the new cabinet, roughly saying, "The future Prime Minister Leon Blum intends to add more director positions, which is tantamount to restoring the councilors of the monarchical era in the past. In the future, the ministers will have the support of the directors, and their administration can achieve great efficiency, and a new factor can also be added to the administrative organization. Moreover, the ministers of each department are all rich in experience and superior in learning, which will naturally benefit the cabinet and will not be restricted by trivial department affairs, but will be able to engage in greater and farther-reaching matters. However, Leon Blum and his associates are still strictly silent about the new cabinet organization. The above is just speculation." (Havas dispatch, 2nd)</p>

<p>Arabs Throw Bombs at Police Station</p>
<p>Jerusalem: The Palestinian authorities have issued an emergency ordinance authorizing district commissioners to order all shops to open. In the past few days, street vendors, shopkeepers who have half-opened their shops, journalists, and municipal staff in several towns have followed the orders of the Arab strike committee to either close or stop work. Therefore, the authorities have issued this ordinance to stop this. Anyone who disobeys the order to resume work will be punished. At the same time, the manufacture of explosives or the transportation of this item into Palestine is prohibited. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>Jerusalem: Throughout Palestine today, riots broke out again as new British troops from Egypt passed through the streets of Jerusalem. Arabs in Nazareth today threw bombs at the local police station, destroyed the Jerusalem-Lydda railway, derailing a train, and opened fire on officials in the Hebron district, setting fire to soap factories opened by Britons and Jews in Lylobes.

<p>Nicaraguan Capital: General Somoza, the leader of the National Guard revolutionaries, claimed today that the revolutionary army has controlled the entire country. In addition, 2,500 troops surrounded the Alcazar Fortress and the city of Leon. The garrison there is likely to surrender due to lack of food. President Sacasa is still surrounded in the La Loma Palace, protected by guards and civilians loyal to the government led by former President Moncada. The situation here is still calm today, but people are panicked. Banks and shops are still open as usual. (National Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Washington) The State Department is paying close attention to the revolution in Nicaragua. President Roosevelt's policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of South American countries may face a severe test. State Department officials are still determined to stand by and watch, hoping that the Nicaraguan army can protect 334 American citizens and $13,000,000 of American investment.

<p>Vaccine Injected Subcutaneously</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Since Edward Jenner's vaccination with cowpox, which has made great contributions to mankind, the year 1936 marks the 140th anniversary. At that time, all smallpox vaccinations were done by inoculation, so the ugly smallpox scars were a common worry for women around the world. In Showa year 5, Dr. Hideo Yaoi, a member of the Japanese Institute of Infectious Diseases, discovered and successfully created a method of subcutaneous vaccination with refined vaccine (vaccination by injection). In the past six years, after a period of careful testing, the result was that President Nagayo of Tokyo Imperial University petitioned for permission to publicly sell this unique refined vaccine using the new vaccination method. Now, with the approval of the two ministers of the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Interior, it will be announced in the official gazette by the Ministry of Education on the same day, and will be sold publicly by the Institute of Infectious Diseases. Japan, ahead of other advanced countries in the world, is implementing this new vaccination method, which is a major reform in the world of vaccination since Jenner. At the same time, it will also promote a major revision of the Japanese Vaccination Law Regulations, which stipulates a dedicated vaccination method. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 3rd)</p>

<h3 id="e80">Japanese in Qingdao Stir Up Trouble: International Negotiations Sparked by Assault on Japanese Elementary School Student <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Since Japan increased its troops stationed in North China, the situation there has become exceptionally tense. Japanese vagrants residing in Qingdao constantly seek opportunities to cause trouble and disrupt the overall situation. However, due to the city authorities' thorough precautions, they have found no excuse to do so, and peace has been maintained. Recently, a Japanese elementary school student was reportedly assaulted by an unknown person. The Japanese saw this as an opportunity and made a mountain out of a molehill, creating an intimidating atmosphere and protesting vehemently to the municipal government, which has led to significant negotiations. The details of the incident and the negotiations are described below.</p>
<p>Incident Account: On the 29th of last month, around 5 p.m., a nine-year-old female student from the First Japanese Elementary School on Bao'an Road was playing at the Japanese sports ground on Rehe Road. At that time, a child (nationality unclear) injured the girl's right arm. The child fled after the incident. Around 6 p.m., two students from the Municipal Elementary School on Huangtai Road, Jiang Wanshan (14 years old) and Yu Cifu (12 years old), who were in the second-highest grade, were returning home after school was dismissed. They passed by the Japanese sports ground and were seized by the girl's parents, who insisted that they were the ones who had injured the girl. They beat and kicked Jiang and Yu, and then sent Jiang Wanshan to the Japanese police station for detention. Yu Cifu was released at the time because of his young age. This is the general account of the incident.</p>
<p>Details of Negotiations: After this incident, the Japanese believed that Chinese elementary school students dared to assault Japanese elementary school students because they were taught anti-Japanese education in school. The Japanese Residents' Association, Youth League, and other groups held an emergency meeting the day after the incident to discuss how to respond. They also requested the Japanese consul to lodge a protest with the municipal government. Upon receiving the news, the municipal government immediately ordered the Public Security Bureau to retrieve Jiang Wanshan from the Japanese police station for interrogation. According to Jiang's statement, the school had designated this week as a "Cleanliness Campaign Week," so every day after school was dismissed at 5 p.m., they had to carry out a major cleaning work for one hour until around 6 p.m. On the evening of the 29th, after work, he waited for the cleaning work to be completed as usual, and at 6:20 p.m., he went home with his classmate Yu Cifu. Unexpectedly, when they arrived at the Japanese sports ground, they were seized and beaten by the Japanese. He claimed not to know who injured the Japanese girl. The Public Security Bureau summoned several of Jiang's classmates to the bureau for questioning. Jiang's classmates all stated that Jiang did not leave the school until after 6 p.m. on that day and had not taken a step out of the school gate before 6 p.m. However, the Japanese insisted that Jiang was the culprit and must be severely punished. The Japanese Youth League sent representatives to the municipal government every day to make a fuss, slapping the table and using disrespectful language. The Japanese consulate also put forward unreasonable demands to the municipal government: 1. The mayor should personally apologize to the Japanese consul. 2. Replace the Director of the Education Bureau, Dang Fazhang. 3. Revise the elementary school textbooks to remove anti-Japanese sentiments. 4. Guarantee that the same incident will not occur again. The Japanese Youth League even threatened that if their demands were not met, they would telegraph Japan and request the naval department to send warships to Qingdao for protection. The municipal government was deeply concerned that the incident would escalate and become difficult to handle. In addition to the repeated attempts at mediation by the Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, Hu Jiafeng, and his earnest negotiations with the Japanese consul, the mayor, Shen Honglie, was away on official business in Beijing and Shanghai. He was urgently telegraphed to return to Qingdao to handle everything. After receiving the telegram, Shen returned to Qingdao by China Aviation flight at 1:30 a.m. today (the 2nd) from Shanghai. According to Secretary-General Hu, the unreasonable demands put forward by the Japanese to the municipal government due to the assault on the elementary school student have been sternly rejected by the municipal government. After the mayor returns to Qingdao, he will formally negotiate with the Japanese side to resolve this matter as soon as possible to avoid further complications.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Huainan Railway: Opening Ceremony on June 5th (Continued) Simultaneously Celebrating the Sixth Anniversary of the Coal Mine Completion of the Railway <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Original Purpose of Building the Road:</p>
<p>The Huainan mining area is located between Huaiyuan and Shou counties in Anhui Province, more than ten miles north of the Hun River. For the transport of coal, although a light railway has been built to reach the Luozhen town on the shore of the Huai River, the coal must still be transported via the Huai River waterway, then transferred to the Jinpu Railway at Pukou, and then sold to various ports. This process of boat and train transfer is difficult to schedule, and the transportation costs are high. The cost of transportation is huge, so the cost is high. Therefore, in order to develop the business of the Bureau and increase the position of domestic coal in the coal market, it is necessary to find a shortcut for transportation. This is the original intention of the Bureau to build the Huainan Railway. Northern Anhui has long been a prosperous area. The Huai River runs across it, and the Feishui flows vertically, gathering lakes and pools between the Yangtze and Huai Rivers. Therefore, agricultural products are especially abundant. After meeting their own needs, they can still be transported to other places for sale. However, in recent years, natural disasters have occurred frequently, and banditry has risen from time to time. Refugees are everywhere, and cultivated land is barren. Farmers are forced by the environment, and they plan to sell their products as soon as they are harvested. In addition, the market scope is narrow, and transportation is extremely difficult, so prices are even lower. The rich cannot live in peace and move to other places. The poor cannot enjoy their work and become even more impoverished. The vitality has been damaged, and few rural villages have not gone bankrupt. Therefore, the construction of the railway, although for the convenience of transporting coal, is also charged with the great mission of reviving the rural areas of northern Anhui.</p>
<p>Extremely Rapid Construction</p>
<p>From the survey and determination of the line to the complete opening of the line, the road took two years. The entire line runs from Tianjia'an on the Huai River in the north to Yuxikou on the Yangtze River in the south, with a main line of 215 kilometers, a branch line of 10 kilometers, and a siding line of about 35 kilometers. The total cost of general affairs, survey, track sleepers, bridges and culverts, stones, track sleepers, stations and houses, and machinery is about 4.8 million yuan in national currency. Calculated on the basis of 215 kilometers of main line, the construction cost per kilometer is about 22,300 yuan. If the 225 kilometers of main line and branch line are combined, the construction cost per kilometer is only 21,300 yuan. Adding in the locomotives and vehicles worth 1.34 million yuan in national currency, the total is about 6.1 million yuan. Calculated on the basis of 215 kilometers, the cost per kilometer is only 28,300 yuan. Moreover, the general affairs expenses of more than 160,000 yuan in the above-mentioned 6.1 million yuan only account for 2.62% of the total cost. Because the engineering equipment has standards and cannot be careless, it is necessary to strive for economy in the general affairs item. Subsequently, with the daily increase in coal production and the abundance of products along the line, passenger and freight transportation is very promising. In order to fully develop the railway's effectiveness, it is necessary to prepare more locomotives and vehicles. Therefore, after the winter of the 23rd year, vehicles worth more than one million yuan were added. However, it is impossible to raise funds by oneself, and the domestic economic situation at this time is extremely serious. The banking industry is quite hesitant about guaranteeing payment, and it has taken a lot of effort to see a start. In addition, the road runs through the Jianghuai area, and Tianjia'an and Yuxikou should have large-scale wharves to connect with shipping. The construction of the wharf at Yuxikou, which is now a hub for coal transportation, is particularly urgent. In the midst of extreme difficulties in raising funds, the business was operated diligently and the construction was carried out with great effort. Now, large vehicles with a load of more than 5,000 tons can be docked, and coal transportation is becoming more and more smooth.</p>
<p>Geography and Products, Population and Resources</p>
<p>Regarding the geography, population, products, and mineral resources along the Huainan Railway, the following is a special description for the purpose of observing the general situation of the areas passed by the railway, and the mission it undertakes. The counties and towns passed by the railway include Tianjia'an, Huainan Mining Area, Shuijiahu, Zhuxiang, Xiatangji, Luoji, Shuangdunji, Hefei, Cuozhen, Qiaotouji, Jiongxiyang River, Zhonghan, Chaoxian, Lintou, Dongguan, Tongchengzha, Shenjiaxiang, and Yuxizhen. Among them, Hefei County is an important area in central Anhui, located in the heart of the Jianghuai area, connecting Lu'an, reaching Anqing in the southwest, Chaowu in the southeast, and Bengbu in the north. Military strategists throughout history have regarded it as a must-contend place. In the past, transportation routes included the Feishui River from the county seat, 70 miles to Shikou, crossing Chaohu Lake southwest to Sanhe, and northeast to Chaowu, all with small steamers operating. From the county seat to Chaoxian, and from Chaoxian to Wuhu, each 180 miles, ordinary upstream and downstream travel takes two days to reach. In spring and winter, the water is shallow and operations must be suspended. The highways include the Chaohe section, the Heye section (currently only通通to Lu'an), the Anhe section, and the Hebei section. However, the roadbeds of each road are not strong, and they must be shut down when it rains or snows. Now that the Huainan Railway has been completed, goods and merchants can take this route north to Luyu, Pingjin, and south to the ports along the Yangtze River. The suffering of stagnation and obstruction will be eliminated from now on. The population of the entire county is about 1.3 million, and the county seat is about 70,000 to 80,000 people. Chaoxian County is the ancient Nan'yi land, where Cheng Tang exiled Jie to Nanchao, which is this place. It borders Chaohu Lake in the west, Hanshan in the east, Hefei in the north, and Wuwei in the south, 180 miles to Wuhu. Small steamers operate, but the journey takes a day. The scenery is quite similar to that of Jiangnan. The products are abundant and sufficient for self-sufficiency. The population of the entire county is about 340,000, and the county seat is close to 70,000 people. The population of other towns ranges from more than 11,000 to more than 1,600. In terms of products, there are coal, wheat, miscellaneous grains, oil, and tobacco in Huaiyuan County; rice, wheat, sorghum, beans, sesame, pigs, oil, chickens, eggs, and tobacco in Shou County; rice, wheat, peanuts, beans, cotton, rapeseed, oil, chickens, eggs, wine, goose and duck feathers in Hefei County; rice, cotton, peanuts, beans, eggs, hairy fish, bricks, tiles, and lime in Chaoxian County; rice, beans, rapeseed, ramie, eggs, ducks, balloonflower in Hanshan County; rice, wheat, beans, cotton, rapeseed, fish, ducks, etc. in Hexian County. The sales locations are the ports along the Yangtze River and the counties in central Anhui.</p>
<p>A Selection of Places of Interest</p>
<p>The Huainan Railway starts from the Huai River in the north and reaches the Yangtze River in the south, running through northern and central Anhui. The cities and towns along the line have been places of must-contend for military strategists throughout history. The southern section is even more frequently seen in historical records. As for the natural scenery, Mount Gui, between Hefei and Chao Lake, is a natural north-south boundary. To the north of the mountain, the plains are vast and boundless, with interconnected fields and scattered villages. The towering blockhouses are often seen, like tigers squatting majestically, all of which are the scenery of North China. To the south of the mountain, the mountains are clear and the waters are beautiful, with lush bamboo and trees, crisscrossing rivers, and sails facing each other, all belonging to the scenery of Jiangnan. The more notable ones are listed below.</p>
<p>Bao Gong Mound: Outside the south gate of Hefei, there is a small mound called Bao Gong Mound, with a temple on it called Bao Gong Temple, with magnificent architecture, dedicated to Song Dynasty's Bao Xiaosu, commonly known as "King Yama Bao." Next to the temple is Bao Gong's reading place, with a stone statue. Below the mound is a small river like a belt, the environment is called Bao River south of the city, flowing east into the Fei River. The river is covered with water chestnuts and lotus roots, and in the height of summer, the red and white lotus flowers decorate the green lotus fields. Small boats are swaying in it, forgetting the summer heat, and feeling carefree. Xiaoyaojin: In the northwest of Hefei city, there are few residents, and Xiaoyaojin is located there. The old trees stand tall, the water is as smooth as a mirror, clear enough to reflect the shadows, about ten miles around, with three or five stone beams to allow passage. Xuanwu Lake in Nanjing is similar to it. Zhang Liao of the Three Kingdoms Wei once defeated Sun Quan's 100,000 troops here with 800 people. There is Zhang Liao's tomb in the northwest, and Li Hongzhang's prime minister's residence about half a mile to the south, still standing majestically. Guishan: Three miles northwest of Chaoxian County, the entire mountain is made of stone, shaped like a turtle, with its head facing Chaohu Lake, as if drinking. Looking around from the mountain, hundreds of miles around can be seen at a glance. The smoke and waves in the lake are vast and full of love, with different scenes in the four seasons and different colors in the morning and evening, truly a beautiful sight. Banyang: Fifteen miles north of Chaoxian County, there is a hot spring called Banyang, naturally forming several pools, the larger ones are square and broad, the smaller ones are seven or eight feet in diameter, clear to the bottom, with bubbles rising like beads, and aquatic plants growing, with small fish swimming in between. More than a dozen residents all take baths here, saying that it has miraculous effects on skin diseases. Chaohu Lake: The source of the lake is in Chaoxian County, which later sank into a lake, with 360 ports and rivers, collecting the waters of Chaoxian, Hefei, Lujiang, and Shucheng, pouring into the Yangtze River, and is a giant swamp in western Huai. In addition to the above-mentioned places, along the line, such as Mingjiao Temple in Hefei, Li's Ancestral Hall in Dayuji, Jile Temple in Chaoxian, Dahu Temple in Changgangji, and Wenbi Pagoda in Dongguan, each has its own strengths, not grand and magnificent.</p>

<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: Di Lunzi, a German professor of German at the Medical College of Henan University, was assassinated last night near the northeast city wall behind the Iron Pagoda in the school. Cao Jinshun, a worker who went to build the forest park this morning, discovered the body and immediately reported it to Yang Songling, a police officer at the Third Precinct in the northern district. After hearing the news, the school also reported it to the provincial government, causing a sensation in the city. People came to view the body in an endless stream. There were no wounds on the body, but the skull was stained with blood, the eyes and nose were unchanged, and all the hair was gone, as if it had been shaved off with a knife. Upon inspecting the back of his straw hat, there was a hole, possibly a gunshot wound. However, his valuable platinum watch, ring, and glasses were all there, indicating that the murder was not committed for robbery. Furthermore, he had only come to Henan University to teach in September last year. Because he could not speak Chinese, he had few social interactions and was dedicated to his duties, and was quite admired by students, so it did not seem to be a case of adultery or revenge. According to Zhang Jingwu, Dean of the Medical College of Henan University, Di lived in Xiyiqi at Henan University and ate his meals at the Huayang Hotel on East Street, boarding there. He was accustomed to taking a walk near the Iron Pagoda every evening after dinner. He taught German for 13 hours a week and did not receive a salary from the school. He was one of four German college professors selected by the German government at the request of the Sino-German Cultural Association to come to China for voluntary teaching to promote Sino-German cultural exchange. He was 34 years old and had no family members in Bian (Kaifeng) (1st).</p>

<p>Since the county implemented the police experimental zone to improve public security in Kunshan and other counties, it has achieved considerable results. The Second Sub-Precinct in the county is a prosperous urban area. Since Director He Runzhang worked hard to reorganize it, the police lineup has been improved. Therefore, the Second Sub-Precinct was changed to a trial implementation of police management. Shen Jizhou was transferred to fill the position of patrol officer, and the original patrol officer Luo Zhenglin was transferred to the Third Sub-Precinct. The patrol officer of the Third Sub-Precinct, Chen Zhigang, was approved to resign. The patrol officer of the Fourth Sub-Precinct, Huang Heqing, was transferred to provincial training. Zhang Hua, the patrol officer of the First Sub-Precinct, was appointed as the patrol officer of the Fourth Sub-Precinct, and Dong Jindu, who returned to Songjiang after training, was appointed as the patrol officer of the First Sub-Precinct. Guan Yaonan, the inspector-general of the bureau, and Qu Shaoquan, the director of the First Sub-Bureau who returned from training, were switched. All the transferred personnel were ordered to complete the handover today. The newly appointed police management patrol officer, Shen Jizhou, has been working in the public security sector for more than ten years. This time, he will definitely achieve good results in displaying his talents.</p>

They once came to Suzhou to invite Cheng Ganqing, chairman of the county chamber of commerce, and Zhang Yipeng, a gentleman, to discuss the project together. They planned to raise one million yuan in shares, with the initiators in Shanghai responsible for 750,000 yuan and Suzhou responsible for 250,000 yuan. The initiators assumed 20 people, 11 in Shanghai and 9 in Suzhou. It has been almost three months since the project started. It is reported that it is difficult to raise shares, and due to various relationships, there are many obstacles to the future, and there is a state of suspension.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the June 3rd Anti-Smoking Memorial Day. All sectors of Wuxian County held expanded publicity activities. On this day, all newspapers published special anti-smoking supplements. In addition to broadcasting anti-smoking songs through the radio export station F, a memorial meeting was held at the Zhongshan Memorial Hall at 10 a.m., attended by about 2,000 representatives from various agencies and organizations and male and female middle school students. After the ceremony, Zhang Yipeng, a member of the anti-smoking committee, gave a systematic speech and reported on the anti-smoking work. Subsequently, Sun Danzhen, the county party affairs commissioner, and others gave speeches in succession. After the meeting, they formed a team and marched through Guanqian Street and Jingde Road before dispersing. Students from various primary schools held anti-smoking speech contests on the afternoon of the 2nd. An exhibition of narcotics was held in the Wuxian County Rehabilitation Center, and Qingbai films produced by Lianhua Film Company were shown to promote anti-smoking.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Wuxi: Appealing for Higher Cocoon Prices <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>The County Farmers' Association of this county stated that the Cocoon Industry Association is currently controlled by the Wuxi Xinxing Silk Factory Trust. At the members' meeting held on May 31, the price of fresh cocoons was deliberately lowered to 30 yuan, ignoring the blood and capital of the silkworm farmers in the four rural areas, causing the farmers to feel a great threat. The association only cared for profits, which is extremely hateful. Although the method proposed by the National Economic Commission Sericulture Improvement Association sets the standard for fresh cocoons at 30 yuan per picul, it should still be adjusted according to the rise and fall of silk prices. The association's method violates the original proposal and is close to deceiving the public. In order to manipulate the market and protect the vital interests of the farmers in the entire county, it specially telegraphed the Ministry of Industry and the Jiangsu Construction Department yesterday, appealing to them to immediately notify the Wuxi County Government to order the Cocoon Industry Association to revise the price of fresh cocoons to 40 yuan per picul based on the actual situation. Although farmers still suffer losses, it is fairer in terms of principle. In addition, Yangming Township in the Third District has convened temporary emergency Baojia meetings with the farmers for several days, and it has been decided that fresh cocoons will not be sold unless the price is 50 or 60 yuan per picul. They would rather discard them and appeal to the County Farmers' Association for relief to alleviate the farmers' suffering.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the June 3rd Anti-Smoking Memorial Day. The County Government and the County Anti-Smoking Association expanded publicity to awaken the people and promote the awareness of smokers to quit. At 9:00 a.m. yesterday (3rd), representatives from various schools were gathered at the public sports ground. Representatives from party and government agencies, various schools, and people from all walks of life, totaling more than 3,000 people, were present. Commissioner Zang and County Mayor Long served as chairmen of the conference. Beforehand, the County Anti-Smoking Association piled up confiscated smoking paraphernalia in the center of the venue to be burned. After the ceremony, Commissioner Zang took the stage to give a speech, saying that when we ban smoking, we must have the perseverance and determination to inherit the legacy of Mr. Lin Zexu. The government must severely punish those who hinder the ban on smoking and are strong enemies of the ban on smoking. Next, Cui Dehua, the section chief of the special commissioner's office, County Mayor Long Tiyiao, and Hou Baosan gave speeches successively, all of which won the approval of the audience. Finally, the burning of confiscated smoking paraphernalia began. For a time, the flames were fierce, and the onlookers applauded and cheered. At 2:00 p.m., the County Rehabilitation Center in Ba'er Lane displayed anti-smoking books, books, statistical tables, and all kinds of contraband drugs, more than 200 items, in the hall for public exhibition. The Hongni Music Association was hired to participate in singing, and the Xin She Qiankun amateur opera troupe performed Peking opera. At the same time, the staff of the center also performed the drama "Smoker's Tears," which was crowded and lively, quite a grand occasion for a time.</p>

<p>There is a silted Yellow River in Guanyun County, which has not been dredged for many years. The county government is now dredging it to straighten out water conservancy and facilitate drainage. The other day, the river dredging mud workers dug up three large ships in the Zhuzha area of the river. One ship was fully loaded with porcelain, one ship was fully loaded with bamboo poles, and one cabin was loaded with dozens of kilograms of platinum. The planks of the three ships had all rotted, and it was impossible to verify when they sank.</p>

<p>Recently, unscrupulous merchants have been purchasing and selling smuggled sugar paper, and many have been transported in recent days. Yesterday (1st), a foreigner from a certain country came to sell it. It is heard that several companies, such as a certain company, have secretly joined forces with him and ordered a large batch of smuggled goods, which will be shipped soon. The Jiashan County Government is paying close attention and trying to prevent it.</p>

<p>In the midst of smuggling rumors, tax-evading sugar from North China has been flowing into Bengbu. Recently, customs anti-smuggling officers have been stationed in Bengbu to investigate. Many sugar vendors have transferred to various counties and towns in northern Anhui to sell it. A batch of smuggled sugar, totaling 240 bags, was transported from the Bengbu river by sailboat to Zhengyangguan for sale. When the ship was berthed in the river outside the west gate of the town, it was learned by the district office. The official Zhu Liangfu and the chief of the Changhuai Aquatic Public Security Bureau went to inspect it. The boatman Zhang Wanbei, the escort Ge Guangjiang, Cai Qingfu, and Li Xihe were arrested, and the smuggled sugar was also found. According to the boatman, it was transported by Bengbu Lixing Exchange and two companies, totaling 240 bags, of which 86 bags had been sold, leaving 154 bags. Official Zhu took all three escorts to the office for detention, and at the same time strictly pursued the sugar that had been sold and telegraphed the special commissioner's office for instructions.</p>

<p>— Yu Jingtang</p>
<p>5.  Smokers Self-Reporting and General Reporting of Opium Addicts</p>
<p>During the general registration period in this province, many smokers were genuinely poor and unable to obtain licenses, leading to evasion of registration. If they were all arrested and prosecuted, it would be truly pitiful. Therefore, in January of the 24th year [of the Republic], approval was obtained to conduct a smoker self-reporting initiative. Unregistered smokers were allowed to self-report to the relevant government offices before the implementation of the Jiangsu Province Interim Regulations for Punishing Opium Prohibition Offenses. They would be sent to addiction treatment centers for free treatment and exempted from criminal penalties to show leniency and caution in imprisonment. According to statistics, as of the day before the aforementioned regulations came into effect (March 31, 1935), a total of 9,244 smokers had self-reported in various counties. All of them had been treated and discharged from the centers. Subsequently, in February of the 25th year, to thoroughly eliminate opium addiction, after the new smoker registration was completed, a general reporting of opium addicts was conducted. Using the Baojia system, all levels of self-government personnel and land and water public security personnel in the province were ordered to mobilize fully, supervising at each level, and setting a deadline to complete the task. At the same time, special commissioners of administrative supervision and county magistrates in each district were instructed to personally supervise the work in their respective areas. The provincial government also dispatched 31 personnel to supervise and guide the work in various counties. In total, from February 16th of the 25th year to March 18th, 20,058 opium addicts were reported.</p>
<p>6.  Prohibition of Planting Poppies and Suppression of Private Trafficking and Smoking</p>
<p>This province was designated as an absolutely prohibited planting area. In the winter of the 23rd year of the Republic, strict orders were issued to various opium merchants and county governments to forcibly eradicate poppy plants. Provincial security teams were also dispatched to assist in the process. Therefore, during the poppy seedling emergence period in the spring of the 24th year, personnel were repeatedly dispatched for overt and covert inspections, and it was reported that the plants had been almost entirely eradicated. This spring, personnel were again dispatched to various areas for thorough inspections. The results showed that due to the dedicated investigations and prohibitions by personnel at all levels over the past two years, no roots or plants were found in remote villages, high mountains, deep forests, or areas bordering neighboring provinces. The complete elimination of poisonous plants in the province can be declared.</p>
<p>The current opium prohibition method in this province adopts a phased elimination approach. Within the statutory time limit, registered smokers and approved opium paste shops and smoking parlors are allowed to operate and smoke legally. However, some unscrupulous individuals still defy the law and engage in private trafficking and smoking, undermining the progress of the prohibition policy. Therefore, strict measures have been repeatedly formulated and earnestly implemented for anti-smuggling work. On one hand, to carefully select anti-smuggling personnel, 80 investigators were recruited in [month missing], 23rd year. A training class for investigators was established, and after four months of rigorous training, they were assigned to various counties to carry out investigative work. In January of the 24th year, a major investigation training group was established, selecting several police dogs to assist in various search skills for hidden opium, including shallow hiding, deep hiding, mobile hiding, high hiding, buried hiding, and water hiding, to supplement the work of investigators. In total, from August of the 23rd year to April of the 25th year, a total of 19,398 opium-related cases were cracked by various counties independently, with the assistance of provincial investigators and search dogs.</p>
<p>7.  Opium Prohibition Funding</p>
<p>In September of last year, the Department of Civil Affairs was ordered to take over the administration of opium prohibition. Due to changes in the organizational system, the opium prohibition funding budget established by the former Provincial Opium Prohibition Committee was no longer fully applicable. Therefore, considering the actual situation, a new overall budget for revenue and expenditure at the end of the 24th year was recompiled and submitted to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for approval. The total annual revenue was estimated to be 1,132,672 yuan, and the monthly expenditure was estimated to be 100,938.50 yuan. Calculating for ten months this year, the total expenditure would be 1,093,385 yuan, which is still within the revenue limit. As for the procedures for receiving and disbursing opium prohibition funds, the Department of Civil Affairs, together with the Department of Finance and the Provincial Opium Prohibition Committee, formulated measures for handling opium prohibition funds and procedures for handling opium prohibition funds in various counties, in accordance with the province's current regulations for collecting and remitting provincial and county taxes and accounting regulations. In total, as of April 30th of this year, the total revenue from license fees was 936,725.31 yuan, and the total expenditure was 662,958.12 yuan. The actual surplus after offsetting revenue and expenditure was 273,767.19 yuan. However, because the year has not yet ended, only the actual amounts received and disbursed have been statistically analyzed. The various amounts that should have been collected or disbursed in May and June have not yet been included. A precise final account will be compiled at the end of the year.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The phased opium prohibition in this province, with registration and licensing, treatment, persuasion, search and re-examination, and livelihood assistance as the basic tasks of implementation control, aims to gradually achieve the goal of phased elimination. It has been implemented for two years now. The progress of the handling has been recalled above. Fortunately, personnel at all levels handling opium prohibition and local people have been able to promote it uniformly, so that the effectiveness has gradually become apparent. However, according to the current regulations, the period for treatment and the end of prohibition is only two years and four months away (the treatment year in this province began on October 1 of the 23rd year and is limited to four years, ending on September 30 of the 27th year). Given the large number of smokers in this province, the complexity of the local situation, and the shortage of opium prohibition funds, we must work even harder in the future to complete it as scheduled. So, what is the direction of our future efforts? The answer is: 1. Continue with the established policy and actively carry out smoker treatment, ensuring that registered smokers in various counties are effectively treated in batches according to their age and smoking volume, and in consideration of the capacity of the addiction treatment centers. 2. Conduct a general inspection of opium addicts to achieve the goal of thorough elimination. 3. Expand the facilities of the addiction treatment centers and strive to improve addiction treatment techniques and administrative management matters, so that smokers are happy to receive treatment and embark on a new path. 4. Establish organizations such as smoker vocational training factories, so that treated smokers have skills to make a living, increasing social production power. Other aspects, such as controlling opium paste shops and smoking parlors, managing smokers, and conducting spot checks and re-examinations, should continue to be actively carried out based on established policies, so as to eliminate abuses and create a clean atmosphere. We hope that local enthusiastic people will continue to assist in promoting this cause with their past sincerity, so that the opium prohibition policy in this province can be seen to succeed early. This is what I sincerely pray for. (End)</p>

<p>June 3rd Commemoration Meeting (Photographed by Guobi Art Society)</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>After the ceremony, Chairman Lu Jingshi delivered the opening speech, stating that, "Fellow compatriots, today is the 'June 3rd' Opium Prohibition Memorial Meeting held by representatives from all sectors of Shanghai. The significance of today's commemoration is to make the public aware of the history of 'June 3rd.' This historical memorial day can make us have a deep sense of memorial value, because this is the beginning of the imperialists' invasion of us, that is, the beginning of the initial establishment of unequal treaties. The opium disaster in the country is so severe. Ninety-seven years ago today, Mr. Lin Zexu, in view of the scourge of opium, implemented opium prohibition. At that time, due to the lack of a strong group and the government's lack of determination, a war was started with the British and failed, but it was glorious. Now the people are extremely poor. The reason lies in opium. If this kind of drug is not eliminated, there is no way to revive the nation. Therefore, the government has made a great determination to ban opium and drugs. The results in the past year have been very good. The international community also knows that we are strictly banning opium and drugs. The cooperation between the government and the people is very admirable. We can only continue to work hard to relieve the national crisis and rely on our own efforts. We can only thoroughly eliminate drugs and break away from drugs."</p>
<p>Mr. Wang's Report</p>
<p>After the Chairman's speech, Mr. Wang Xiaolai reported on the opium prohibition situation in the city, stating that, "Brothers, on behalf of the Opium Prohibition Association, I report on the general situation of opium prohibition in Shanghai. Since April of the 23rd year, the Nanchang Headquarters reorganized the Hubei Special Tax Office into the Opium Prohibition Supervision Office, handling opium prohibition affairs in ten provinces. Liu was in charge of military law and decided on a two-year drug prohibition and six-year opium plan, successively promulgating various opium prohibition laws to thoroughly ban opium. The city established the Opium Prohibition Committee in July of the 24th year, hiring Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Yan Fuqing, Wang Yiting, Wang Boqi, Yu Zuoting, and Yu Qiaqing as members, responsible for supervising the progress and improvement of opium prohibition. Smoker registration began in July of the 24th year. The Public Security Bureau specially set up a smoker registration section, which handled registrations until the end of December, registering a total of 30,844 smokers, including 11,838 who obtained ordinary five-yuan licenses and 17,995 who obtained six-jiao poor people's licenses. Regarding the situation of addiction treatment, (A) a temporary addiction treatment center was established in Longhua. From June of the 23rd year to June of the 24th year, 2,211 people were forcibly treated and 1,173 people voluntarily sought treatment. From July to April of the 25th year, there were a total of 1,712 people, for a total of 4,096 people. (B) The Huinan Addiction Treatment Hospital was established (at Santai Pier in Nanshi), with a total of 2,445 men and women treated. (C) The Hubai Addiction Treatment Hospital was established (on Tiantong'an Road in Zhabei). From May of the 24th year to May of the 25th year, a total of 3,315 men and women were treated. (D) The criminal addiction treatment hospital was established. From September of the 24th year to April of the 25th year, a total of 935 men and women were treated. (E) Other designated addiction treatment hospitals, from July to December of the 24th year, reported a total of 61 men and women treated. In total, 10,852 men and women have been treated for opium addiction. Although there are no statistics on those who voluntarily quit opium addiction, the number must be considerable. Regarding license handling, addiction treatment licenses are checked every six months. It is hoped that smokers with licenses will go to the Public Security Bureau to exchange for new licenses when they expire to avoid losing protection. A standard for phased treatment has been determined, based on age and smoking volume, with the first year for those under 30 years old, the second year for those under 40 years old, the third year for those under 50 years old, the fourth year for those under 60 years old, and the fifth year for those over 60 years old. [missing] The Smoker Registration Examination, Chairman Chiang issued an order in February of this year to conduct a reporting of smoker registration and promulgated 14 articles for the method of reporting smokers. After receiving the order, the city cooperated with reporting commissioner Mr. Ma Liang to handle it together. It has now begun. It is hoped that smokers in the city will not miss this last opportunity and quickly go to the Public Security Bureau to complete the registration. The above is a general overview of the opium prohibition work in the city over the past year. It is hoped that representatives from all sectors will continue to urge the government to cooperate with the government to thoroughly eliminate this enemy of our nation that has been harming us for more than a hundred years. This is not only a blessing for the city but also a blessing for China. After the report was completed, I had a little feeling, that is, opium drugs must be banned, and cigarettes are not noticed by ordinary people, but in fact, the annual consumption loss is also considerable. The annual leakage is 80 million. I have been breaking away from cigarettes for 28 years. I hope that those who [missing] quit at any time."</p>

<p>Mr. Ma's Speech</p>
<p>After the Principal's report, reporting commissioner Ma Liang gave a speech, stating that, "Representatives from all walks of life, today is the June 3rd Memorial Day. The Chairman's report on the meaning of the commemoration is very detailed. I don't need to repeat it. I have a brief report on the significance of opium prohibition and reporting. Chairman Chiang has made a great determination. Therefore, he also serves as the Opium Prohibition Supervisor and has formulated a six-year opium prohibition and two-year drug prohibition plan. It has been two years now, and the prohibition results have been very good. The first basic task is registration. Shanghai's registration has already begun, and the number of registrants is also very enthusiastic, but it is inevitable that some are waiting and not moving forward. Therefore, I was sent to report. On one hand, registration has been extended for three months to give smokers a last chance. The Chairman said that the government's efforts alone cannot be completely eliminated, because the government's power cannot reach many places. Only the joint efforts of the people can achieve complete results. It is hoped that everyone will rise up to urge and strive to achieve complete success."</p>
<p>Mr. Du's Speech</p>
<p>Mr. Du Yuesheng made a broadcast speech on Guohua Radio yesterday to awaken the awareness of compatriots. The topic was "From the Commemoration of Mr. Lin Zexu, the People of the Country Should Have a Sudden Awakening." His original words are as follows: "Ladies and gentlemen, today is the June 3rd Opium Prohibition Festival. To commemorate the sage Mr. Lin Zexu, the people of the country generally have a deep understanding of Mr. Lin's personality and career. Mr. Lin can be considered the most fiercely opposed to the scourge of opium in Chinese history. When he supervised Guangdong, he had a great determination to eradicate the scourge of opium with resolute means, burn opium, and refuse opium merchants to land. Such strong external resistance created a record in modern history. Although the result was a failure, his greatness of character, firmness of will, and eagerness to protect the country are worthy of lasting for all ages. Since Mr. Lin's fierce resistance against British opium merchants, it has caused the Sino-British War and has a special appeal in the history of war. Generally speaking, the Opium War has had a great impact on our country. At that time, Qing Qian only knew to seek safety in the north and did not hesitate to compromise and seek surplus, signing the Treaty of Nanjing, opening Shanghai, Ningbo, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Guangzhou, and five ports as trading ports, and withdrawing Mr. Lin to reconcile. The theory of pedantry still regards Mr. Lin's opium prohibition as a crime. They do not know that if opium is not eliminated, even without foreign aggression, it will surely perish. Not only will the country perish, but the race will also perish. Mr. Lin's far-reaching intention was not understood by the powerful officials of the Qing court at that time. Mr. Lin's personal humiliation was small, but the loss of the country was great. For a hundred years, it has been in decline. How could Mr. Lin have foreseen this? Some commentators say that Mr. Lin's ambition was great, but the methods he used still have room for consideration. The change of excessive manipulation may be avoided. However, in the environment at that time, those who were in charge of the coastal provinces were all colluding with local treacherous merchants, soliciting bribes of forty yuan per box of opium and protecting trafficking, which was almost an open secret. Therefore, Mr. Lin's decisive action was to subdue foreign merchants and warn corrupt officials. Otherwise, there were very few superior strategies. If the Qing court was the backing, then Mr. Lin's opium prohibition success can be expected. Mr. Lin's opium prohibition is now nearly a hundred years ago, and the depth of China's opium problem is truly alarming. Therefore, Chairman Chiang has made a determination and a grand vision. Those who sincerely want to thoroughly save China must first eliminate the opium that harms the nation, and issue a national decree to implement the six-year prohibition plan, ordering the entire country to abide by it. Sincere knowledge of punishment is not as good as watching, so I do not hesitate to reiterate three orders and five applications, and work hard on propaganda work, and even give the opportunity to renew the sentence with great effort. All opium people should share the government's grace, and realize that they should realize and automatically quit. In addition, today medical science is advanced, there are many methods of addiction treatment, and its effectiveness has been proven by facts. I sincerely hope that compatriots who are addicted to opium will no longer wait and see and abandon themselves. You must know that those who can love their own bodies are also loving the country. If you want to release the shackles of national treaties, you must first release the individual from the shackles of hobbies. Self-strength and strong country, is what I hope for the self-awareness of compatriots."</p>
<p>Conference Slogans</p>
<p>The conference slogans were as follows: Commemorate June 3rd, follow Premier Sun's instructions on drug rejection. Commemorate June 3rd, support the government's policy of strictly prohibiting drugs. Commemorate June 3rd, strictly implement opium user registration procedures. Commemorate June 3rd, severely punish opium and drug dealers. Support Chiang's Opium Prohibition Director. Long live the Kuomintang of China. Long live the Republic of China. Quit opium and drugs starting today. Manufacturers and sellers of drugs will be shot. June 3rd is the day to commemorate Lin Zexu's burning of opium ninety-seven years ago. Opium prohibition is a prerequisite for national rejuvenation. Opium is the public enemy of the Chinese nation. Thoroughly implement the two-year drug prohibition and eight-year opium prohibition plan. Support Chiang's Opium Prohibition Director's policy. From January 1, 1937, drug users will be shot. Opium prohibition and bandit suppression are equally important. The whole country rises up to reject drugs. Opium prohibition must combine the power of the government and the people. Prohibiting the planting of opium is the government's policy to protect farmers.</p>
<p>Burning of Narcotics</p>
<p>After the memorial meeting, the participating representatives all went to the playground of the Shuji Elementary School in Tianhou Palace to participate in the burning of opium, drugs, and smoking paraphernalia. In addition to the entire representative and presidium, Zhang Zi, prosecutor of the Local Court, Tang Peiyou, prosecutor of the First Special District Local Court, and Si Wangren, prosecutor of the Second Special District Local Court, were present to monitor.

<h3 id="e98">Japan Increases Troops in North China and Engages in Smuggling; Chamber of Commerce Cables Government Requesting Negotiations; Customs Prevents Smuggling on Roads; Various Industries Notify Members to Take Precautions <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Jiang Telegram</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the Executive Yuan and Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating: "To the Honorable Executive Yuan and Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Nanjing: Japan's increasing of troops in North China, as well as preventing customs from suppressing smuggling, leading to increasingly rampant smuggling, is a major event that hinders our country's sovereignty and undermines the lifeline of our finances. Repeated negotiations have failed to yield results. The government should urgently adopt a firm and determined spirit and consistently maintain its position. Regarding Japan's increasing of troops in North China, it is using the Boxer Protocol and the protection of overseas Chinese as excuses. However, Article 9 of the Boxer Protocol states that the purpose of stationing troops is to protect the Beijing-to-Sea passage. In essence, it is for the safety of the embassies, not for the purpose of protecting overseas Chinese. Therefore, the protocol stipulates that the troop stationing locations are all along the Beijing-Shenyang Railway line and are not specifically focused on treaty ports with overseas Chinese. Now, the Beijing-to-Sea passage is not in danger of obstruction. Increasing troops for protection is not necessary in fact. Moreover, the current troop stationing location of Fengtai originally belonged to China's responsibility. According to Article 1 of past treaties, it was originally China's responsibility. According to past treaties, there has never been a provision for self-stationing of troops for protection. Even considering the previous situation in the three northeastern provinces, troop deployment was limited to the South Manchurian Railway protection zone and not in every treaty port with overseas Chinese. Yanji Prefecture is a precedent. If we take today's North China as an example, with tens of thousands of Japanese overseas Chinese, it would require stationing a brigade to protect them. At that time, Yanji Prefecture had one to two hundred thousand Korean overseas Chinese under Japanese nationality. Wouldn't that require stationing several divisions to protect them? A comparison clearly demonstrates the lack of a basis for their argument. As for customs suppressing smuggling, according to Article 18 of the Sino-Japanese Trade Treaty, China has the right to devise and implement measures to prevent smuggling in all treaty ports. The Tanggu Truce Agreement signed by military officers of both countries cannot affect the trade treaty signed by the two governments. Moreover, customs police belong to the customs and are completely different from the military system. They cannot be considered part of the military and subject to the truce agreement. We earnestly request the government to exert all efforts in negotiation based on international law and past treaties to safeguard the nation's lifeline. This is in the public interest. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce respectfully appeals, Jiang."</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Reply Telegram</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance telegrammed the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, stating: "The government has promulgated measures to prevent road transport smuggling, interim regulations for punishing tax evasion, and interim regulations for inspecting the sale of imported goods, all to stop smuggling. Strict enforcement has been ordered. Having read the chamber's telegram and attached copies, the submitted points align with the government's intentions. If industries and businesses can uphold their patriotic sincerity and recognize the pain of tax revenue loss, smuggled goods will naturally disappear. This will not only benefit the country through tax revenue but also protect industries and businesses themselves. Please communicate this immediately to relevant parties for their information."</p>
<p>Jianghai Customs Proclamation</p>
<p>Jianghai Customs Superintendent Tang Hai'an and Customs Commissioner Ba Runsen jointly issued Proclamation No. 1519, stating: "It has been verified that the Executive Yuan has approved measures to prevent road transport smuggling, which have been ordered to be implemented. The General Inspectorate for Preventing Road Transport Smuggling of the Customs has also issued Proclamation No. 1. According to the regulations in the aforementioned measures, all foreign goods transported by rail must have a tax-paid certificate issued by the customs. Otherwise, the railway bureau will refuse to transport them. It is hereby determined that from June 3 of this year, merchants transporting the foreign goods listed in the attached table from this port to other places via rail shall, one day before loading the goods, obtain a "Tax Payment Certificate Application Form" from this customs office, fill it out according to the prescribed format, and submit it along with all the original import tax documents for the goods. After verifying that it matches the original import declaration, the tax payment certificate will be issued free of charge. This certificate can then be presented to the customs inspection offices at various Shanghai stations of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways or at the Wuxi station for verification. After the verification office confirms that the goods and documents match, it will sign and stamp the certificate. The merchant can then submit the certificate along with the railway freight car to the railway for consignment. After this proclamation, if any of the foreign goods listed in the attached table are transported by rail without this certificate, they may be seized by the customs officers stationed at the arrival station. The goods listed in the attached table may be subject to change depending on the circumstances. This proclamation is hereby issued for the information of all merchants.

<h3 id="e99">Zhejiang Province Agrees to Release 60% of Confiscated Silk Cocoons for Export; Remaining 40% Awaits Legal Disposition; Manufacturers Hope for Prompt Release to Avoid Disputes <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Zhejiang Silk Control Committee's confiscation of silk cocoons from silk manufacturers and cocoon merchants within the province whose cocoon pulling prices were below the central price for export, the Shanghai Silk Manufacturers Guild presented its reasons and telegraphed requesting release. A reporter from Xin Sheng News visited Mr. Shen Huachen, chairman of the Silk Industry Guild, yesterday and received detailed information, which is recorded below.</p>
<p>Release 60% First</p>
<p>Regarding the Zhejiang Provincial Government's confiscation of spring cocoons obtained by silk manufacturers and silk merchants within the province whose cocoon prices were below the central price for export, this guild has telegraphed the Silk Control Committee requesting prompt release. Based on its observation, the matter will not escalate because the low price of Chinese silk in European and American markets and the inferior quality of this year's cocoons compared to last year are factual issues. The Zhejiang Silk Control Committee is also very clear about this. According to reports from members in Hangzhou via long-distance telephone, Zhejiang Province has agreed to release 60% of the confiscated spring cocoons for export first, while the remaining 40% will await legal disposition. Therefore, it is expected that a peaceful resolution will be reached soon.</p>
<p>Significant Impact</p>
<p>If this matter is not resolved quickly, serious problems will inevitably arise. This year, manufacturers received loans from the financial sector to purchase cocoons, using the purchased cocoons as collateral. If the collateral is confiscated, disputes will inevitably arise. Manufacturers have already sold silk to foreign firms, but they may not be able to pay on time because the previously sold silk prices were higher than current prices. Foreign firms will inevitably take the opportunity to cancel contracts. As for the current price of Chinese silk, B-grade standard silk is worth 570 national currency. The price of Chinese silk on May 20 when the cocoons were purchased was 640 yuan, a difference of 70 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Cholera Prevention Announcement <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Cholera Prevention Temporary Office Announcement No. 1: It is now June, and this year seems to be a "cholera year," with a possible epidemic. This office is issuing its first announcement. According to past experience, there is a periodic outbreak every three or four years. The personnel of this office's epidemic prevention team are experts from various health agencies in Beijing and Shanghai. They have worked hard to study the causes of this outbreak and seek appropriate prevention and control methods. Specifically studying weather factors, it seems that there is too much rainfall in general, but the table below shows that it is not too much.</p>
<p>Over the past 65 years, the average rainfall in this port from January to May has been 14.87 inches. Therefore, this year's rainfall is still below the average. Compared with the rainfall and rainy days in 1920 and 1922, the difference is very large. According to the opinions of health authorities such as Sir Keith, short rainfall is conducive to the spread of cholera. In 1923, the rainfall from January to May was 12.47 inches, and there were many cholera cases. However, last year's rainfall at the same time was 10.27, and there was no cholera outbreak. Therefore, in terms of rainfall, it seems difficult to predict that there is a possibility of an epidemic this year, but we must still pay attention and cooperate with health agencies to achieve preventive effects. Cholera is often a disease transmitted through water, but it is not limited to drinking water. Contaminated hands, unclean utensils, contaminated vegetables, fruits, cold drinks, and flies can all cause it. Therefore, all unheated foods and unreliable beverages should be avoided. Food preparers must wash their hands. Regarding the above matters, all homeowners and employers should be responsible for guiding servants and workers. During a cholera epidemic, the working class suffers the most. Various municipal authorities in Shanghai and the water company provide free water for the benefit of the poor. There are now 30 free water taps in the Public Concession, open at fixed times every day, and 91 in the French Concession. The poor can fetch water at fixed times. There are more than 50 places in Shanghai, so all poor people should no longer drink contaminated water. A new water plant has also been recently established in Pudong, and the poor in that area will also receive the same benefits in the future. However, among the poor, there must be those who live too far from the water facilities or do not have time to fetch water when the taps are open. Therefore, other water sources, such as wells and ponds, are also disinfected by health agencies. In the event of a cholera outbreak, thanks to this comprehensive protection, it is expected to reduce the spread and prevent it from expanding. Regarding cholera vaccination, it began on April 15 in the French Concession, May 1 in the Public Concession, and May 15 in Shanghai. This preventive method has gradually gained the trust of the public since 1930, and the number of recipients has increased every year. The number of vaccinations in the past six years is listed below.</p>
<p>It is hoped that the number this year can be increased. It is hoped that the residents of this metropolis can be vaccinated once a year, regardless of whether an epidemic is discovered in the future. Mobile vaccination vehicles and health sub-stations are distributed throughout the city so that residents can be vaccinated nearby. This vaccination is completely free. The educational propaganda carried out in streets, schools, factories, and other places has achieved considerable results, which can be used to awaken the public and make them aware of the importance of preventing cholera. Knowledgeable people should also do their best to help with this matter. This year, there are about eight hospitals in this port that can accommodate cholera patients, with a total of about 1,000 beds. The names of the hospitals and the number of beds are listed on the left.</p>
<p>After cholera occurs, the patient should be sent to a suitable hospital for treatment immediately. This should not be ignored. A slight delay can endanger their life.</p>
<h3 id="e101">More Than 40 Industries' Workers Demand Restoration of Organizations; Assist Government in Reporting Smuggling; Merchants Tend to Seek Profits, So It is Difficult to Guarantee They Will Not Traffic Smuggled Goods; Workers Are Closely Related to Business and Can Report at Any Time <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Workers in more than 40 industries, including the local produce, pharmaceutical, sauce, pharmacy, Chinese and foreign cloth, dyeing, rice, ginseng, food, cosmetics, department store, etc., in order to assist the government in reporting smuggling and unified command, specially jointly submitted a request to the central government to restore the workers' union organization. The original submission is recorded as follows: "We are submitting this to request approval to restore the workers' organization to assist the government in effectively reporting smuggling. We respectfully observe that since our workers' organizations were deemed incompatible with current laws in 1930 and should not exist, the status of workers has been transferred to members of the industry guild. For several years, how many workers have been able to participate in the industry guild? All authority is in the hands of the capitalists. The worker's position has been abandoned by the industry and abandoned by society. We are all citizens, but is this fair? Looking back to the time when our workers had organizational structures, their history of promoting government policies and assisting in national construction was quite effective in the progress of the revolution. Recently, Japanese ruffians in North China have been smuggling and evading taxes, which has become increasingly serious. Our central government, in order to protect tax revenue and maintain industry, has strictly revised the interim regulations on punishing tax evasion to curb private sales. This is an urgent plan for the present. Merchants tend to seek profits, which is a common human sentiment. In the face of huge profits from smuggled goods, they are willing to violate the law and take risks, even to death. (Omission) Smuggled goods have gradually expanded from North China to other regions, rushing directly to the central ports along the Tianjin-Pukou and Peiping-Tianjin lines. Coastal ports, such as Shanghai and other places, will also be affected. Smuggled goods are like a sudden storm. In a few months, the loss of national tax revenue has reached more than 100 million yuan. The losses to industry and commerce affected by smuggled goods are several times that amount. If this continues, the national economy will inevitably be fundamentally shaken. We look to the future with deep fear. Our workers are part of the nation. At this time of national crisis, we will not stand idly by. Although our workers are hired by shopkeepers, they have a close relationship with business and no direct vested interests. Even if the business becomes rich, the workers will get nothing and merely satisfy the capitalists. Therefore, they can't earn any benefit from this. As smuggled goods become rampant, it is difficult to guarantee that unscrupulous merchants won't become involved. If capitalists traffic in smuggled goods, workers will see it with their own eyes and can hardly conceal it. We can assist the government in reporting smuggling without leaving anything out. In order to ensure the strictness of the reporting work and the speed of action, it is necessary to allow workers to restore organizational structures. The entire plan should be discussed and implemented by the organization. The effectiveness will be far better than the methods promulgated by the government. Therefore, we specially jointly and sincerely request your union (department) to promulgate separate regulations for workers as soon as possible so that they can organize according to law. We respectfully submit this to the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department and the Central Party Department for National Training, awaiting orders."</p>
<h3 id="e102">General Manager of China Industrial Bank, Hu Mengjia, Passed Away Yesterday; Financial Circles Universally Mourn; Gong Xianzhou Presides Over Bank Affairs <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Hu Mengjia, Director of the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank and General Manager of the China Industrial Bank, suffered from anemia due to overwork in early spring of this year. He sought medical treatment for several months, but his condition did not improve. On September 22, he moved into Fumin Hospital on North Sichuan Road for treatment, staying in room 17 on the fifth floor. After an X-ray examination by the hospital, no other symptoms were found, but his anemia worsened daily. This was reported in this newspaper. He underwent three blood transfusions, three injections of special saline solution, and five injections of cardiac stimulants, but the effect was minimal. His blood pressure and fever increased daily, causing his physical strength to decline. He once experienced urinary incontinence. Since May 28, his condition suddenly worsened again. Despite ineffective treatment, he passed away at 1:10 PM yesterday. His family notified the China Funeral Home on Haig Road to transport his remains to the funeral home by car and temporarily placed them in the West Hall. Surgery and embalming will be performed. The funeral will be held at 10 AM on June 5. Upon hearing the news, the financial circles in this port expressed their condolences and elected Qian Xinzhi and others to handle the funeral arrangements. Mr. Hu's name was Zuitong, and Mengjia was his courtesy name. He had five brothers. Hu was the eldest, 49 years old, the second named Cilang, the third named Shushao, and the fourth named Jiping, childhood name Shaoqing, all of whom are currently employed by the Central Communications and Shanghai Industrial Trust Society. He was originally from Yin County, Zhejiang Province. He graduated from the University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom with a master's degree in economics and was elected as a member of the Royal Economic Society of the United Kingdom. He returned to China in the first year of the Republic of China and was hired as a professor and dean at the Zhejiang Hangzhou College of Politics and Law and other schools. He entered the financial industry about eight years later, first serving as the deputy manager of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank and then as the deputy general manager of the head office of the Bank of Communications in Peiping. In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, the bank moved south, and Hu was appointed as the general manager of the head office, manager of the Shanghai branch, and was twice elected as a Chinese director of the Shanghai Public Concession Board of Directors. In addition to serving as Director of the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank and General Manager of the China Industrial Bank, he also served as a standing director of the Bank of Communications, director of the Shanghai Bankers' Association, director of the China Enterprise Bank, and supervisor of the Guohua Bank. He was honest and self-disciplined, eager to help others, and especially fond of charity work, so he did not accumulate much savings after his death. He is survived by five sons and six daughters. The eldest son is only 19 years old and is studying at Peicheng Girls' School. The youngest daughter is only six years old. His wife, Ms. Bi, is in her thirties. She once provided blood transfusions for Mr. Hu. His second daughter, named Yixin, is 18 years old and is also studying at Peicheng. The Board of Directors of the China Industrial Bank unanimously elected Chairman Gong Xianzhou and Standing Director Li Jizhi to go south to preside over the bank's affairs after learning of Mr. Hu's death. Mr. Gong and Mr. Li have both held important positions in the political world and are giants in the banking industry. The bank's business will surely thrive in the future. However, it is a great pity that Mr. Hu's knowledge made him one of the most talented people in China, but he has passed away.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Zhang Shizhao Emphatically Advocates that the Constitution Should Prioritize Facts; Never Mentioned Advocating Dictatorship; Absolutely No Memorial was Submitted; —The Truth About His Speech at Jiang's Banquet— <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>According to the New Sound News Agency, lawyer Zhang Shizhao recently went to Beijing for legal affairs and visited friends in the government. He attended a banquet hosted by President Jiang on May 26, where he made some remarks about the draft constitution. The content of these remarks was unknown to outsiders, leading to rumors in Beijing and Shanghai that Mr. Zhang advocated for presidential dictatorship and had submitted a ten-thousand-word memorial to President Jiang. A reporter from the New Sound News Agency visited Mr. Zhang at his residence yesterday, asking him to reveal the truth within the realm of possibility to dispel misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Discussing Ideals is Indeed a Mistake</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang said, "I am naturally frank and have nothing to hide. Before the draft constitution was announced, Mr. Wang Liangchou told me that the constitution was based on the people, and he hoped that legal scholars outside the party would provide fair criticism to arouse the interest of the people in the constitution. I replied that the constitution should be realistic, not ideal. Twenty years ago, we were fond of discussing the constitution based on personal ideals, which was indeed a mistake. I have not written political essays for many years, and due to my efforts to earn a living, I have not had time to study the political organization of the current National Government in detail. Since Mr. Wang asked me to criticize the constitution, I had to briefly examine the current political situation before writing to avoid being out of touch with reality."</p>
<p>Prioritizing Facts Over Ideals</p>
<p>"My speech in Beijing this time was generally along these lines. My words at President Jiang's banquet were also similar. I also cited the example of France, saying that after the French Revolution, the People's Party liked to create a constitution based on pure ideals, but its implementation often led to friction. As a result, the constitutional draft was repeatedly created and rejected, reaching twelve times. It was not until the final Third Republic that it accommodated reality, vigorously advocated simplicity, and announced the constitution of 1870, which stabilized the situation. For the past sixty or seventy years, France has been thriving. A constitution that prioritizes facts over ideals is the most appropriate example."</p>
<p>Absolutely No Memorial was Submitted</p>
<p>"The French have very high ideals, separating the creation of law from legislation. A constitution should be created by a constitutional body, meaning that the state precedes the constitution, and the government follows the state. Creating law means creating the law that precedes the state, while legislation means establishing the law by which the government is governed. The boundaries between these are very clear. However, the Third Republic's constitution even included a clause appointing General MacMahon as the first president for a seven-year term. This concerns the government's personnel matters, which is several levels below constitutional creation. Yet, the constitution emphasized it so prominently, disregarding its own rules. This shows that reality is compelling and can overthrow ideals. As for how well our country's draft constitution aligns with the current reality, I have not yet begun to study it and cannot make a judgment. However, I can confidently assert that the constitution should prioritize facts. The purpose of my speech at the time was roughly this. As for the rumors that I advocated dictatorship, I never mentioned it. Absolutely no memorial was submitted." The reporter found Mr. Zhang's words quite frank and recorded them as above, which can also be said to be beneficial to the current state of politics.</p>

<h3 id="e109">American Overseas Chinese Leader, Li Zhuofang, Discusses the Way Out for Domestic Goods <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Li Zhuofang, a leader of overseas Chinese in the United States, has returned to China to inspect and purchase domestic goods. A reporter from the New Sound News Agency met with Mr. Li yesterday. According to his discussion on the way out for domestic goods, "Overseas Chinese compatriots in the United States feel that the production in their motherland is lagging behind. They believe that they must vigorously promote the use of domestically produced goods in order to recover the country's rights and interests. Therefore, they are happy to purchase domestic goods for their daily necessities. People in the United States welcome Chinese goods such as Chaozhou porcelain, silk, bamboo products, toys, bronze ware, and rattan ware. If domestic manufacturers are willing to improve their products, focusing on low cost and new styles, they can be sold overseas. My (Mr. Li referred to himself) biggest task on this return to China is to find a way out for domestic goods. If domestic goods manufacturers are willing to cooperate or have any requests, I will sincerely welcome them. I will stay in Shanghai for about two weeks, and after completing the inspection work, I will go to Tianjin, Beiping, Hong Kong, and other places. I plan to stay in China for about four months and return to the United States in October. I plan to set up domestic goods purchasing offices in Shanghai and Hong Kong to facilitate contact with manufacturers at any time. In short, advocating the use of domestic goods to save the country is the most urgent task today. I hope that all sectors of society will work together and provide support and guidance. I will be grateful." In addition, the China National Products Maintenance Association is scheduled to hold a meeting this Friday to welcome Mr. Li and facilitate communication.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Ministry of Railways Orders All Railway Bureaus to Prioritize the Use of Domestic Electrical Appliances <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways, in order to promote domestic electrical appliances, issued an order to all railway bureaus and directly affiliated agencies, stating, "In accordance with the Executive Yuan's Instruction No. 3179 of May 21, 25th year of the Republic, the Shanghai Electrical Appliance Manufacturing Industry Association submitted on May 13, 25th year of the Republic, stating, 'Regarding the request to order all subordinate agencies and guide the people in various regions to purchase electrical appliances, all of which should be domestic goods. The manufacturing of domestic electric fans in our country has a history of 20 years. Because of their excellent quality and low prices, they are popular with people across the country and overseas Chinese compatriots. When the production of domestic electric fans was not high, the price of imported electric fans was several times higher than the current market price. As the production of domestic electric fans increased, imported products could not compete with them due to tariffs and transportation costs. In addition, the people's enthusiasm for using domestic goods has become more and more fervent. They deeply feel that domestic electric fans are exquisite and even surpass imported products. As a result, the sales of imported electric fans have greatly decreased. Last year, domestic electric fan factories such as Huasheng, Huatong, and China Yabuer, seeing that competition with foreign countries depended on the unity and cooperation of the industry, organized a joint sales office. Since its operation, it has gained the trust of the people. Unexpectedly, this has aroused the jealousy of foreign merchants, who have tried their best to destroy it. This year, they even imported electric fan parts separately, assembled them in Shanghai by hiring workers, seeking to reduce tariffs on the one hand and taking advantage of low wages on the other. They manufactured a small number of electric fans and deliberately lowered prices to disrupt the market. The annual production of domestic electric fans has recently reached more than 40,000 units, while foreign merchants only account for 4,000 to 5,000 units. Therefore, a price drop of 3 yuan per foreign unit would only result in a loss of more than 10,000 yuan. However, if domestic electric fans were to drop in price by 3 yuan as a result, the annual loss would be more than 100,000 yuan. The price fluctuations are very large. Now, foreign merchants are using this disruptive trick during the peak sales season, and domestic electric fan manufacturers can only bear the pain of cutting prices to avoid delaying time and unsold products. The magnitude of this loss is immeasurable. Furthermore, it is heard that foreign merchants have exhausted their strategies and will gradually increase their production each year, determined to completely occupy the domestic electric fan market. If this continues, how can domestic industries survive? Therefore, we request your council to order all subordinate agencies to use domestic electric fans from now on, and to issue an order to all provincial and municipal governments to encourage the people in various regions to purchase domestic goods when purchasing electrical appliances in the autumn of economic hardship, where national goods are dumped. This is a plea to maintain the lifeline of domestic goods factories and ensure that the nation's life is not reduced. We urgently appeal and humbly request your attention and prompt action.' Based on this, promoting domestic goods is the most important task at present. At this time of booming demand for electrical appliances, when the domestic electrical appliance manufacturing industry is still in its infancy, it should be especially promoted. In the future, all agencies and the people should prioritize the purchase of domestic products to maintain domestic goods and prevent leakage. In addition to issuing separate orders and instructions, we hereby order you to comply and instruct all subordinate agencies to comply as well. This order."</p>
<h3 id="e111">Purchasing Aircraft for Birthday Celebration: Various Entertainment Venues Enthusiastically Support <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Fundraising Committee of the China Aviation Association's Expanded Aviation Save-the-Nation Movement, which presents aircraft purchased with funds to the government, has been organizing entertainment venues for the 50th birthday celebration of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and the income is transferred to the donation, with excellent results. Ms. Deng Lili, the manager of the Continental Ballroom, is enthusiastic about construction and decided to donate all the income from the golden day (Sunday) on the 7th to purchase aircraft for the birthday celebration, as previously reported. It is heard that the interior renovation of the hall has been completed, and it has been completely revitalized and artistic. In addition to dancing and entertainment on that day, movie stars Ye Qiuxin, Bai Hong, Li Mingjian, Han Langen, etc. will be hired to sing and perform, and the Chinese Harmonica Association will participate in the performance.</p>
<p>The office has also received donations from Tao Guilin (1,000 yuan), Lake Society (100 yuan), Sheng Shengyuan (400 yuan), Minli Middle School (225.5 yuan), Xuhui Middle School (70 yuan), Shanghai Orphanage staff (20 yuan), Great China Rubber Factory First Factory workers (542.13 yuan), First Factory pieceworkers (221.82 yuan), factory staff one-day salary (38.44 yuan), and the business office distribution office (73.78 yuan), and the general affairs section of each factory (40.096 yuan), demonstrating enthusiastic support and commendable actions. It is heard that they have been tallied and thanked.</p>
<p>After Mr. Huang Jinrong took the lead in donating by performing plays at the Huang Jin Grand Theater, Great World, and Gong Stage, the entertainment venues in the city have been sympathetic to the purchase of aircraft for the birthday celebration. After Mr. Huang dispatched personnel to contact various venues, such as the Great Stage, Tianchan Stage, Renewal Stage, Wing On, New World, and Fu'an, they have all held events. It is learned that the New World Amusement Park, after being contacted by Fan Liangbo and Chen Fukang, has also decided to donate all of today's income to purchase aircraft. The Queen's Theater will also hold an event at the same time. It is heard that the committee has assigned Zhang Yuliang, Song Ji, Huang Jun, Zhang Xiamin, and Gu Shangrui to take care of the event.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Zhang Binghui and Yan Wenkai Returned to Shanghai After Inspecting Japan; Talked About Japan's Admiration of Shanghai's Group Weddings; Many Aspects of Social Undertakings in Japan are Worth Learning From <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Binghui, the chief of the fourth section of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, and Yan Wenkai, the chief clerk of the bureau, were dispatched to Japan to visit the World Wedding Expo and inspect social undertakings. They have now completed their tasks and returned to Shanghai by the Shanghai Maru the night before last. In addition to reporting to the mayor, they released a joint statement yesterday, saying, "We were ordered to go abroad to inspect social undertakings in Japan and visit the World Wedding Expo. Due to the short duration of the trip, we were unable to study in detail. However, based on what we have seen and heard, we feel that social undertakings in Japan can develop evenly. Furthermore, due to the clarity of social surveys, the social undertakings that are undertaken are increased or decreased at any time according to the actual needs of society. For example, the public cafeterias run by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government have achieved great success, and more and more people are following suit. There is a proposal to reduce them this year. If childcare centers have not yet met the needs of society, there are plans to increase them. Other relief undertakings, although not seen as very developed, can concentrate their undertakings and unify their management policies, which increases efficiency and does not waste resources. It is necessary to learn from and improve the charitable undertakings in our city. Cooperative undertakings in Japan are called 'associations.' We visited the Tokyo Central Industrial Association and warehouse, which are large in scale. Their business provides loans to farmers and small businesses, which is a credit cooperative in nature and has been very successful. The anti-production movement of farmers' banks and middle-level merchants in various places shows a glimpse of the development of this type of association. As for consumer cooperation, there is no success to speak of other than family consumption associations in cities. As for the Japanese grain warehouses, which are world-famous, our city is currently planning to build warehouses. Therefore, we visited the largest rice grain bureau warehouse in Tokyo. The completeness of the equipment, the abundance of storage, and the rationality of the architecture are sufficient for us to emulate. The World Wedding Expo was held in Osaka, at Tsurumi Ryokuchi Park. Although the scale is not very large, it has collected wedding materials from around the world and has considerable views. In particular, the evolution of Japanese weddings is displayed using giant models, with lifelike expressions, which is very characteristic. Looking at the evolution of weddings around the world, they mostly came from coercion, buying and selling, and matchmaking. Recently, it has evolved to mutual love between the two sexes. Weddings have evolved from simple to complex, and now they are tired of complexity and tend to be simple. As personnel are becoming more and more complex, weddings have to become easier. The materials for group weddings collected from our city were all displayed in it. According to the person in charge of the association, many people from various countries who came to visit praised it and thought it could be used as a reference for the evolution of modern weddings. Wedding waste in Japan is comparable to that in our country. Therefore, they are particularly interested in group weddings and have the idea of imitating them. We met many overseas Chinese in Japan who often inquired about group weddings. Some even specially bought photos and hung them on the wall, requesting to visit Shanghai to see a group wedding. We feel very happy about this. As for the large number of unemployed and beggars in various cities in Japan, the government has tried its best to control them, so it is not easy to detect. We have two deep impressions during our trip to Japan: First, the Japanese people generally possess four spirits: diligence, hard work, frugality, and cleanliness. This is true even for government officials. Diligence can reveal subtleties, hard work can establish fate, frugality can know hardship, and cleanliness can embrace life. With these four paths, nothing cannot be advanced. This is the root cause of Japan's wealth and power. Second, education is universal. For matters that are not easy for the government to construct, they can all clearly identify their goals and sacrifice their individuals. The government uses its great power to complete construction. Unlike our country, where doing something often involves many constraints, leading to changes in the original plan, and the results are naturally difficult to see. If our country wants to become rich and strong, the above two points are especially important to study and implement." In addition, Japan pays the most attention to children's welfare undertakings. Children's playgrounds can be seen everywhere. Large stores in cities also have children's playgrounds on the roofs. The prices of children's books and all supplies are set low to make them easy to buy. They also pay great attention to child care, which is also worth learning from in our city.</p>

<p>At the Binjiang River of Hengbang Bridge in Zhabei, a woman of about 18 or 19 years old suddenly attempted to commit suicide by drowning at about 9 PM last night. After someone reported the incident to the police, she was pulled out of the water. After vomiting a lot of water, she quickly regained consciousness and was taken to the police station. After questioning, it was learned that she was Li Zhangshi, a 19-year-old woman from Liyang. She married Li Zhongcai, a mailman, who lives at No. 2, Shengfa Lane, Changchun Road. She attempted suicide by drowning because of a quarrel. Her husband, Li Zhongcai, was notified to come to the station to take her home.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Bandit Xu Renhe; Identified Among the Crowd by Witnesses; Definitely the Humaiyi Hotel Robbery <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>On the morning of the 20th of last month, at 1 AM, two bandits armed with weapons broke into the Humin Humaiyi Hotel at No. 393, Maybach Road, and robbed them of 8 yuan in legal tender. They shot and killed the hotel worker Liu Zifu and wounded Fan Tianfu with bullets. The case was already investigated by the New Zha Police Station and Chinese Detective Chief Hua Guo, who arrested the suspects: Hua Jinsen, the former platoon leader of the Security Regiment; Xia Jinliang; Xu Renhe; and six detectives from the Public Security Bureau: Zhang Zuoxian, Zheng Bucai, and Wang Yucai. They were sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. The details have been reported in this newspaper. This morning, the translator and judge from the Criminal Division 8 continued the interrogation. According to Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer for the police station, the police station is prosecuting Hua Jinsen and the other six defendants not only for selling military firearms and ammunition in violation of Article 187 of the Criminal Law, as they were found to possess a Ning brand pistol and eight bullets, but also for Xu Renhe for the crime of robbery and murder in violation of Article 332 of the Criminal Law. Because the case is being adjourned, the victim Fan Tianfu pointed out that Xu Renhe was at the scene robbing money. Also, the owner of the Humaiyi Hotel, Xu Yugui, also pointed out that Xu Renhe was holding a gun at the scene. Therefore, in order to clarify the facts of the case, it is requested that it be postponed again. Furthermore, according to the West Detective Chief Erkosi, he reported that he had mixed the defendant Xu Renhe among nine prisoners and asked the witnesses to identify him in the police station. Fan Tianfu, Xu Yunqiu, and another hotel worker, Hu Huanquan, identified him separately. Furthermore, according to Fan Tianfu, he is 60 years old and from Yangzhou. He runs a noodle shop. On the night of the robbery, two bandits broke into the shop. One bandit held a gun at the door, and the other bandit went inside to rob. The defendant Xu Renhe was the robber. The other bandit holding the gun was attacked by the hotel worker Liu Zifu, who was then shot and killed, and my left leg was wounded in two places. My injuries have not fully healed. Furthermore, according to Xu Yugui, I only saw the back of one bandit holding a gun, and it seemed to be the same height as Xu Renhe. When Xu Renhe was questioned, he flatly denied any involvement in the robbery and murder case. Judge Tan briefly questioned the other defendants and ordered them to be detained for further interrogation at a later date.</p>

<p>Liu Huizhen, a woman from Suzhou who lives at No. 58, Xinxiude Lane, Baike Road, is 22 years old. In December of the 22nd year of the Republic [1933], when Liu was a prostitute in the brothel opened by her adoptive mother, Chen Laoliu, on Broadway Road, she was seduced by Yang Zhongfen, the current deputy director of the Central South Bank. At the time, Yang falsely claimed that he had no wife and was willing to marry Liu. They began to rent a house and live together, and their love was deep. On August 18 of last year, she gave birth to a son named Ali. Until the end of the year, Liu found out that Yang had a wife. She negotiated with him, but Yang immediately changed his mind. Not only did he cut off all daily expenses, but he also treated her like a stranger and never visited her. Liu hired lawyer Feng Buqing to file a complaint with the First Special Court, accusing Yang Zhongfen of adultery and abandonment, requesting that he be punished according to the law, and also filed a civil lawsuit, requesting that he be ordered to pay living expenses and educational fees for the child, totaling 20,000 yuan in national currency. The case has been tried twice by the court, but because Yang Zhongfen failed to appear, the case was adjourned. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Jiang Shuzi continued the hearing in Criminal Division 3. The plaintiff, Liu Huizhen, arrived in court with her two-year-old son, Ali (but the defendant, Yang Zhongfen, did not arrive, and his lawyer appeared on his behalf, stating that Yang had been ordered by the chairman of the Central South Bank to go to Xiamen on official business, so he could not make it today and requested another adjournment. He would be responsible for bringing Yang to court next time). Judge Jiang adjourned the case to be heard again on the afternoon of the 15th of this month.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Muslim Association Celebrates the Prophet's Birthday: Grand Meeting Held in Qinglian Street, City, Yesterday Morning; Attended by Over Four Thousand Local Guests and Over One Hundred Foreign Guests <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday (June 3rd) was the twelfth day of March in the 1355th year of the Islamic calendar, the birthday of the most holy Prophet Muhammad of Islam. The Shanghai Muslim Association specially led the city's Muslims in holding a grand commemorative meeting. It was broadcasted by the China-West Wireless Radio Station, with lectures given for three days, from 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM. Additionally, 200,000 leaflets were distributed by airplanes, and ten propaganda teams were organized to distribute 120,000 booklets in three series, and 100,000 copies of religious doctrine leaflets were distributed in five districts—east, west, south, north, and center—throughout the city. The details of the grand meeting are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Venue Arrangement</p>
<p>The venue was the auditorium of the Chinese Islamic Studies Association. Outside the door, a large archway made of pine and cypress was erected, with the words "Shanghai Muslim Association Celebrates the Prophet's Birthday Commemorative Meeting" written on white cloth. Inside the entrance was a rest area for those who signed in, as well as for the security guards. To the left was the office of the general director, and next to the auditorium on the left was a guest room for visiting guests. In the center of the auditorium were hung the Party and national flags and a large framed mirror presented by Mayor Wu Tiecheng, with the words "Sage of Arabia" inscribed in the middle. Because the association feared that the auditorium would be too small to accommodate everyone, a sound system was specially installed on the large playground next to the auditorium to broadcast the speeches.</p>
<p>Attending Guests</p>
<p>From around 9:00 AM, guests began to arrive one after another. By 10:00 AM, the venue was already overflowing. It is estimated that over four thousand local guests and over one hundred foreign guests attended the meeting, making it a grand occasion.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>The presidium consisted of Li Zhibo, Li Yunsheng, Da Pusheng, Ha Decheng, Xie Ke, Ren Yonghu, and Ma Tianying. After the meeting was called to order with the ringing of a bell, Mr. Mai Jun'er A recited the scriptures, and then Mr. Li Zhibo reported that Islam is a religion of peace and that today they were celebrating the Prophet's birthday for the sake of peace.</p>
<p>Speeches (Summarized)</p>
<p>Da Pusheng gave a speech about the life of the Prophet, detailing the virtues of the Prophet's life. Following that, Mr. Ye Bin spoke, and Indian Islamic philosopher Mr. Syed Haji spoke about the true meaning of God sending prophets to preach. It is not only for Islam, but actually for people all over the world. A Muslim who believes in God, the scriptures, and the Prophet should also believe in other scriptures and prophets. Islam knows no racial, national, or religious boundaries. We must know that Islam is broad in meaning, not narrow. We should be friends with the world and treat each other as brothers. If all the people in the world believed in Islam, then everyone would be under the teachings of the Prophet, forming one body. All the conflicts in the world can be eliminated, and we can enjoy the happiness of lasting peace. Mr. Ezra, the editor of the Shanghai Jewish newspaper, spoke about how Islam and Judaism can be considered sister religions because they share the same origin and are close to each other. All the essence of Islam is also the essence of Judaism, and they share the responsibility of proclaiming belief in the one true God. The five most important tenets of Islam are: belief in the one true God, praying five times a day, giving alms, fasting, and pilgrimage to Mecca. The Prophet shouldered the important mission of proclaiming religious doctrines and persuading the Arabs and the people of the world to believe in the one true God. Many critics argue that the Prophet spread Islam with the sword, but this is not true. The Prophet never used the sword to proclaim the truth but led people to the right path with lofty ideals and morals. Is such a great religious figure as the Prophet not worthy of admiration and commemoration? Mr. Zhang Shouyong spoke about how the world can only achieve peace if it can achieve "selflessness." The Prophet was the sage who was best able to achieve "selflessness," so Islam can become a religion of peace. Mr. Thomas, a translator for the Shanghai Times, spoke about how, in the teachings of the Prophet, it can be seen that the Prophet attached great importance to peace. The Prophet instructed us to greet each other with "peace," wishing each other the peace and tranquility of God. The meaning of peace is not limited to the material and superficial, but the spiritual peace or tranquility is the deeper meaning of "peace." Mr. Du Di, a director of the Shanghai Zhejiang Road Mosque, spoke about how the Prophet, upon receiving God's revelation, first corrected his own body and mind, and then persuaded the people of Mecca and Medina, and finally spread the message to people of all countries. We should understand our position. First, we must be clean and firm in our beliefs, and then proclaim the truth to the world and persuade people to enter the right path, etc. After the speeches were completed, the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>Evening Dinner</p>
<p>Last night, mosques on Shanghai Zhejiang Road, Fuyou Road, Xiaoshadu, and Nanmen all held lectures on religious doctrines and dinners, celebrating until dawn.</p>

<p>The issue of the rickshaw mutual aid fee in the special zone, after being resolved through negotiations between the association and the Public Works Department, the association specifically notified the car dealers, saying, "For notification purposes, a letter was previously received from the Car Committee of the Public Works Department, stating that car owners must pay both the May and June mutual aid fees when claiming their June licenses." The car owners believed that they were unable to pay due to the current economic downturn, and they unanimously rejected the fee. Yesterday, this office sent representatives to attend the negotiations. After much debate, the Car Committee has resolved and confirmed that the mutual aid fee collected in May must be paid in June, and in the future, it will be handled in accordance with prior collection. It is hoped that all warehouse owners, when claiming their June licenses, will still pay the collected May mutual aid fee to the Zhejiang Xingye Bank, obtain a receipt, and present it to the Public Works Department to obtain a license to operate. This is a special notice.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Bingzi Disaster Relief Dharma Assembly; Completed Dharma and Retreat Yesterday; Initiation Scheduled for 1 PM Today; Zhu Qinglan and Qu Wenliu Both Participate <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The Bingzi Disaster Relief Dharma Assembly, initiated by local celebrities Zhu Ziqiao, Qu Wenliu, Jian Yujie, Zhao Hengti, etc., officially opened on July 28th and concluded yesterday. It was scheduled to send off demons and retreat from the altar at 4:00 PM yesterday. Details of the situation are noted below:</p>
<p>Completion Yesterday</p>
<p>Since the association borrowed the Jueyuan Pure Karma Society on Hedder Road to build two altars in the auditorium on the second floor and the lower hall, and since the Rongzeng Kanbu of Tibet and Dharma Master Chi Song each occupied an altar to initiate the Grand Vajrabhairava and Ushnishavijaya Disaster Relief Dharma Assemblies on the 28th of last month, a week has passed, and yesterday they finally came to completion. It was decided to respectfully send off the demon food offerings at 4:00 PM in the afternoon, and then retreat from the altar, and the merit was thus completed.</p>
<p>Initiation Today</p>
<p>After the Dharma assembly was completed yesterday, Dharma Master Chi Song will hold the Ushnishavijaya Buddha Initiation Dharma at 1:00 PM this afternoon, using a vase to pour water and sprinkle it on the heads of all those receiving the Dharma, in order to eliminate calamities. In addition to all the directors such as Zhu Qinglan and Qu Wenliu, many men and women have registered with the association in recent days to participate in this initiation ceremony. After the altar is closed, all kinds of Dharma instruments will be donated to the Longhua Mongolian Tibetan College for display.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Japanese Sailor Case Continues; Ye Haisheng Testifies; Was Tortured at the Police Station <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Bound to a bench and had water poured into his nose, and short cigarettes were stuffed in; But the police station said that Ye was treated very well; The court must appraise the gun and books, and the announcement will be rescheduled for retrial; It was ruled that Ye Haisheng and Yang Wendao be transferred to the general patrol room</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon was the date for the continuation of the trial of Yang Wendao, Ye Haisheng, and Zhou Sherong, who were accused of killing Japanese sailor Nakayama Hideo. The lawyers representing the Public Works Department, originally Ru Bao Yi and Bo Liang, did not appear in court yesterday, and were jointly represented by lawyer Li Zhishan and lawyer Ru. City Secretary Zhang Tingrong and Section Chief Huang Hua of the Third Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau were still in court to observe. At 2:16 PM, Qian Ye, the criminal judge of the Second Special District Court, along with judges Feng Shide and Xiao, prosecutor Zhang Zongru, and clerk Ding Chongnan, ascended the first criminal court to continue the trial. According to the statement of lawyer Ru of the police station, the last time in court, based on the testimony of Qi Haisheng, it was said that he had swallowed</p>
<p>Two Keys</p>
<p>and metal objects in his abdomen, and suffered injuries. It was decided to send Qi to the Public Works Department Hospital for a forensic examination. The police station sent Ye to the hospital, and the forensic doctor conducted a joint examination. After first using X-rays to examine Ye's abdomen to see if there were any keys or metal objects inside, the results showed that none of the above-mentioned objects were present in his abdomen. The examination of Ye's wounds showed only a slight break in his lips, which could not prove how it was broken. Now, the reports from the deputy superintendent of the Public Works Department Hospital and the director of the X-ray department are evidence. The police station attaches great importance to Ye's allegations of torture and has conducted an investigation. All personnel involved in handling the case, from Deputy Chief Patrol Officer Robertson to detectives, have prepared reports stating the</p>
<p>Detailed Process</p>
<p>which can all be presented to the court. The Western detective Kleut and the Japanese detective who were sent to Qingdao to investigate have not yet returned to Shanghai, so please postpone the trial after hearing it. Judge Qian checked and instructed clerk Ding to read the medical examination report of Ye Haisheng. Mr. Ding stood up and read that the examination found a pink scar one centimeter long and half a centimeter wide on his lip, and friction marks from soft objects on his sixth, seventh, and eighth ribs. After reading, the court immediately asked Ye Haisheng about the date of swallowing the keys and metal objects. According to Ye, he swallowed two keys before the first time I confessed to committing the crime. As for swallowing the copper, it was after the second time he admitted it in court, and the date</p>
<p>Cannot Remember</p>
<p>The court then asked about the torture situation. According to Ye, two or three days after the court adjourned for two weeks, my eyes were tied up and I was tied to a bench. Water was poured into my nose, and then two short cigarettes were stuffed into my nose, so the wound on my lips was caused by this. The court then questioned Yang Wendao, saying that you confessed that the book hiding the gun was replaced by Yang Jianzhong, but the confession did not mention Yang's name. Yang replied that it was Yang's trap. Asked if he had ever seen the book, he replied that he had not seen it at the police station or the first time he was taken to court. He only saw it after returning from the court, but he did not start reading it. At this point, Ye Haisheng's pro bono lawyer, Zhang Zhirang, stood up and said that regarding the swallowing point, when my lawyer interviewed him, Ye mentioned that he was</p>
<p>Having Diarrhea</p>
<p>So it may have been discharged, and it is not known. Now the hospital's examination shows that there are no metal objects in Ye's abdomen, but it cannot prove whether Ye did swallow the key before or not. As for the friction wound on the ribs, it is consistent with Ye's confession of using his fist to rub it. The mark on the lips, according to the forensic report, is very neat and definitely not scratched by fingers. Although Ye Haisheng was sent to the Public Works Department Hospital by the court last time to check for injuries, it also implied treatment, but the police station still detained Ye in the police station after the examination, which is obviously</p>
<p>Contradictory to the Court's Ruling</p>
<p>This is a past event, so let's not discuss it for now. Now my lawyer has a reasonably suitable improvement method to request from the court, that is, to send Ye Haisheng to the court's detention center, and the police station can send more police officers to guard him. As for the interview, it may as well follow the police station's interview method to avoid being considered a malpractice. This point should be adopted by the court. Judge Qian then declared that the detention center of this court only belongs to civil cases. Your lawyer is afraid that there is a risk of being tortured. If this is the case, the personnel responsible must be responsible. Even if he is detained in this court, the police station can still take him back for investigation at any time, so the request cannot be granted. Lawyer Tang Huaiqun then stated that Ji Haisheng was not immediately sent to the hospital after the last court hearing, but was</p>
<p>Sent the Next Morning</p>
<p>Lawyer Ru of the police station immediately stood up and refuted, saying that since the court's order last time, the police station also believed that if it was indeed swallowed with metal objects, it would be very dangerous, so it was immediately sent to the Public Works Department Hospital. After being examined with X-rays, there was no situation as Ye said, so he did not need the doctor's care, so he was sent back to the police station. He had no disease, so how could he live in the hospital as an exception? Judge Qian then declared that this court has now received a statement from Yang Wendao's wife, Yang Jinshi, requesting that he be sent to the hospital according to Ye Haisheng's precedent. This point cannot be approved. Then he asked lawyer Ru of the police station whether Jack was brought to court today. Lawyer Ru replied that according to the reason given by the Japanese Consulate, the consulate's investigation of</p>
<p>Jack's Part</p>
<p>has not been completed, so he cannot be sent to the case. Then the witness Zhang Chen voted, saying that one day Zeng Yuanjia's wife asked me to accompany Zheng Huimin's house to ask for money. When I went, I saw Yang Jianzhong sitting in Zheng's living room, wearing a black suit, with a very tall stature. Zeng Yuanjia's wife said to me, this is Yang Jianzhong. I had never seen Yang Jianzhong before, and I did not talk to him that day. At this point, Judge Qian Wei said that this court has now sent the seized gun and bullets and the books with holes dug out from Yang Wendao's house to the Forensic Institute for appraisal. Regarding the bullet, please identify three points: Whether the bullet has passed through the human body, Whether there is blood on the body after passing through, Whether</p>
<p>There Are Traces</p>
<p>After the Bloodstains Have Been Washed Away, There Are Four Points To Be Identified Regarding the Books: How Long Does It Take for the Hole to Rust, Can Rust Be Artificially Created, How Long Has the Hole Been Dug, How Long Does the Blue Pencil Mark Left at the Installation and Removal Site Last? Now it is said that it can be identified, but it takes a very long time, so this case should be investigated after the appraisal is returned. Lawyer Zhang Zhirang also said that regarding whether there are patrol officers stationed in the pavilion of Fengle Village where the gun was seized and whether the doorkeeper of Fengle Village, Li Hongbin, has a confession, there are no confession lists. Please investigate and reinstate the request to improve the</p>
<p>Detention</p>
<p>Lawyer Ru of the police station said that he could investigate the two points mentioned by lawyer Zhang. As for the improvement of the detention, he made a statement, saying that the police station handling this case belongs to the Dieswei Road police station, and the police station, for the sake of caution, specifically detained Ye at the Chengdu Road police station, and Yang Wendao and Zhou Sherong were detained at the general patrol room. In fact, it is also to avoid or have a bad treatment. Moreover, Ye Haisheng's treatment is more preferential than any other prisoner. What kind of dishes and rice Ye wants to eat, the police station will take care of it, and Ye is deeply addicted to cigarettes, and the police station will also allow him to smoke cigarettes, even when he meets with the lawyer,</p>
<p>He Also Smokes Cigarettes</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the police station treats Ye very well. If the defense lawyer does not believe it, he can ask Ye to know. The lawyers of Yang Wendao, Ge Zhaoji and Guo Qiming, also made a statement. The court adjourned the indefinite postponement because the case had to wait for the appraisal to be sent, and ruled that Ye Haisheng, Yang Wendao, and Zhou Sherong should be detained at the general patrol room. When he was sent to the court, tears filled his face, and he wiped his eyes frequently with his sleeves. His inner suffering can be seen from this.</p>

<p>Zhou Baixing, a native of Pudong, 19 years old, made a living by farming. His parents died early, and he lived with his grandfather, Meiyu, 65 years old, in the first household of the sixth bao and third jia of Zhoujiazhai, Pudong. The day before yesterday, Baixing returned from gambling and asked his grandfather for money but was rejected. He became angry and beat his grandfather accidentally, injuring a vital point and killing him instantly. Baixing saw that he had caused trouble and fled without a trace. After Baixing left, neighbors reported to the Shanghai County Public Security Bureau at that location, and specified that Baixing must be temporarily avoiding in the relative's home at No. 139, Jiazi, Luzhai, Bailinan Road, West Shanghai. According to the report, the bureau immediately sent Chief Police Officer Wang Baobo, along with police officers, to the Caoxiadu Public Security Branch to arrest Baixing and bring him to the police station. The bureau, considering the case as involving the beating to death of a respected relative, immediately prepared a document to hand over to the General Bureau for police to bring him back to justice.</p>

<p>A farmer surnamed Ye from Jiuguoqiao in Minhang Town had a domestic ox. A few days ago, while grazing in the wild, it was suddenly bitten by a mad dog. Within a few days, the ox went mad and kicked pedestrians. The owner secretly sold it to a certain ox village in the north. When the owner sent someone to pull the ox, he was kicked down by the mad ox. The owner, seeing that the ox was seriously mad, invited many people to beat and hoe it together, and then killed the mad ox. A gecko (i.e., scorpion) was found curled up in the brain. Later, someone from the ox village dragged the cow into the river and disappeared.</p>

<p>Jiang Futian, inspector of the French patrol room, and detectives Wang Rusong and Liu Jinle, etc., arrested bandits Tao Qiuquan, Zhou Genfu, Yang Ruigen, Shen Anan, Chen Yongtang, Zhang Lizhi, Sun Jiaju Sun Jiaji (policeman No. 3896 from the Nanshi Railway Station Police Station), Cai Jinfu, Zhao Fugen, Gu Linsheng, Pan Gensheng, Sun Jiaquan, Chen Atu, and Yang Nanchang, etc., a total of fifteen people, at Tianyuan Hotel No. 78 Xiamen Road on Caishi Road and Liyuan Road in Huajie, etc., on the 30th of last month. They found a Shanghai Public Security Bureau No. 7382 eight-inch Bai Langlin pistol and seven bullets on Tao Qiuquan, and a pistol, a fake pistol, iron, etc. in Tao Qiuquan's house. Together with Tao's sister, Fan Tao, they were arrested by the patrol room and sent to the Second Special Court for detention and investigation. After investigation, five people, including Sun Jiaju, Zhao Fugen, Chen Atu, Yang Nanchang, and Fan Tao, were found to be irrelevant to the case and were first released. Cai Jinfu, Gu Linsheng, and Pan Gensheng were taken away by the Public Security Bureau to be brought to justice because they had committed crimes in Jiangwan, Suzhou, etc. Tao Qiuquan and the other seven were publicly prosecuted by the French Police Department for the crime of robbery. After the presiding judge Wang Gangxu opened a court session for investigation and concluded, the details of the scheduled sentencing have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Wang ordered the defendants to be brought to the case in the first criminal court. After questioning their age and origin one by one, he announced the verdict. Tao Qiuquan, Zhou Genfu, and Chen Yongtang, who were in a gang of three or more and carried weapons, were each sentenced to six years and eight months of imprisonment, and deprived of public rights for six years. Sun Jiaji and Zhang Lizhi were each sentenced to five years of imprisonment. Yang Ruigen and Sun Jia were each sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment and deprived of public rights for two years. Shen Anan was sentenced to four years of imprisonment and deprived of public rights for three years. Because the thieves also committed robberies in Huajie, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau sent the reconnaissance squad leader Chen Guangyan to the Second Special Court with documents held by reconnaissance officer Yu Liangzhi yesterday morning, requesting to bring the defendants back to justice for interrogation. The court approved it and ordered the defendants to be handed over to the personnel from the Public Security Bureau to take them away for interrogation.</p>

<p>Xu Wancheng, the editor of Longwen Bookstore in Dananmen, the city, recently suddenly published a special issue of Xu Wancheng's work report in various newspapers, and published a close-up photo of Xu. Yesterday was the first day of the special issue attached to the Minbao. There was a paragraph in it called "Soliciting Essays for the Investigation of the Dark Side of the Chinese Judiciary." In it, he not only attacked the president for the loss of twenty pistols from the thief's warehouse of the Shanghai Local Court, but also said that the court did not handle affairs on time, court clerks openly asked for money, bailiffs were arrogant, and judges questioned in a vague manner, etc., in unspeakable terms. He also said that judges surnamed Zhao took bribes, which was not uncommon, and solicited articles for compilation, etc. After these articles were published, the judges surnamed Zhao in the court, including Zhao Yong, Zhao Yusheng, and those with similar pronunciations, included Shao Qinzhi and Cao Baozhen, and the president Luo Tong, because of the relationship between the judges and bribery, according to what was written in his special issue, summoned Judge Zhao to question the failure of the lawsuit. Later, Xu Wancheng was also punished by the court for a stamp tax case, so this article was obviously slanderous. Therefore, Judge Zhao asked the president to thoroughly investigate and immediately send bailiffs to summon Xu Wancheng, but he was not found. He will be summoned continuously.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Two Westerners' Interview About the Winner of the First Prize of the 22nd Aviation Lottery <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The first prize number of the 22nd Aviation Highway Construction Lottery is 101564, which was jointly won by Francisco Garcia, a foreign employee of the Hong Kong Da Lai Shipping Company, and his friend Constantino Rodas. Last month, Garcia and Rodas came to Shanghai from Hong Kong by wheel to collect the prize money. A reporter from the Shin Shi News Agency heard the news and paid a special visit to the two gentlemen at their hotel to inquire about the circumstances of winning the prize, which was quite interesting. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Addicted to Buying Tickets, Won Four Prizes</p>
<p>Garcia was radiant and amiable, sucking on a light cigar and spitting out wisps of smoke, very satisfied. According to him, the aviation lottery has been drawn in the past, and its credibility is well-known. I am very addicted to buying lottery tickets. I buy several tickets every issue, or more than a dozen. My friend Rodas works at the Hong Kong Life Insurance Company and has the same addiction as me. He often contributes to buy with me. We often buy lottery tickets from the Shanghai National Government Aviation Lottery Office or the Dayun Company by mail. I have won six or seven small prizes, and I won four prizes once last year. I thought I was lucky, but I didn't expect the first prize of the 22nd issue to be won by me and Mr. Luo. It's really a surprise. From now on, we have a very good impression of the National Government Aviation Lottery.</p>
<p>Won the First Prize by Chance and Became a Wealthy Man</p>
<p>For the 22nd aviation ticket, Mr. Yu and Mr. Luo only bought one ticket together, which was still purchased by mail from Shanghai Dayun Company. When the lottery was drawn on May 8th, my friend happened to be going to the Philippines on business, and the tickets he bought were also taken away by Mr. Luo. At that time, the number of the tickets purchased was not recorded, so after the first prize was drawn, I was still unaware of who the wealthy man belonged to. It was not until a few days later that Mr. Luo sent a quick telegram from the Philippines that I suddenly realized that Mr. Yu and Mr. Luo had become wealthy men with 250,000 yuan. At that time, the joy was beyond words. From now on, we have an extremely good impression of the National Government Aviation Lottery.</p>
<p>The Circumstances of Winning the Prize Are Twisting and Interesting</p>
<p>According to Mr. Rodas, I am very interested in aviation lottery tickets. I had no intention of getting rich at first, but I didn't expect that in the 22nd aviation lottery, I actually won the first prize with Garcia, which was completely unexpected. When the lottery was drawn, Yu Shi Garcia and I won the first prize, which was completely unexpected. When the lottery was drawn, Yu Shi took a business trip to the Philippines. I was lonely and used browsing newspapers to help me pass the time. One morning, I read the newspaper and saw the news of the aviation ticket drawing and the first prize number. I suddenly remembered that I had bought a ticket, which was still hidden in my suitcase. Why not take it out and check it? After checking it, the number of the ticket I bought was exactly the same as the number of the first prize drawn. In my surprise, I still felt half-doubtful. It was not known whether the number published in the newspaper was wrong. Therefore, I sent a quick telegram to Shanghai from the wheel to inquire about the truth from the Dayun Company, and paid the return telegram fee in full, asking them to reply by telegram as soon as possible. When my wheel was docked at Philport, Dayun Company's reply telegram had arrived. Only then did I know that I had become rich. After that, I used champagne to congratulate the reporter and wish him good luck. Finally, the reporter asked what he would use the prize money for. It is said that he is quite willing to invest in China and support all construction projects.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Upon the Bed, Wang Jiyang Dies Suddenly; Investigation Clearly Indicates Death by Illness <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Wang Jiyang, a native of Ningbo, aged fifty-seven, was the head mechanic at the Guanghua Petroleum Company. He resided in Jiangxinsha, Pudong. Recently, the Guanghua Company ceased operations, and the owed bonuses to employees and laborers, amounting to tens of thousands of gold, were delayed. Negotiations were unsuccessful. Wang was selected by his colleagues as a representative to resolve the matter through legal means. Therefore, on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, around 2 p.m., Wang went alone to the residence of his fellow townsman, Yao Fuyuan (aged forty-three, employed at the Zhengzhong Law Office in the mainland commercial area), at No. 57 Hengmao Lane, Baxianqiao, French Concession, on the second floor, in the pavilion room, to discuss the lawsuit. Upon entering, he felt dizzy and lay down on Yao's bed. After talking for about half an hour, Wang suddenly stretched out his legs, foamed at the mouth, and became unconscious. Yao took him by carriage to the Jì Hospital, but he died before receiving treatment. The hospital notified the French Concession police, who dispatched detectives to investigate. The body was transported to the Tongren Fuyuan branch for autopsy. Meanwhile, Wang's wife, Wang Wangshi, was summoned for questioning. The next day, a report was made to the Second Special Court. Prosecutor Wang inspected the body and confirmed that the deceased had died of illness. The body was claimed by his wife for burial.</p>
<h3 id="e128">At the Gong Wu Stage, a Conflict Over Accounts; Started as a Joke, Then an Argument; Resulted in Injuries on Both Sides from the Fight <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Yang Binghua, a native of Hangzhou, aged thirty-three, residing at No. 21 Xinshou'an Lane, Min Ti Ni Yin Road, French Concession, formerly worked as an account keeper at the Gong Wu Stage theater on Avenue Edward VII. Later, he cohabited with a tanhuang (Shanghai opera) singer named Ding Wan'e and is now a "laoguan" (patron) of tanhuang at the New World entertainment center. At 2:30 p.m. on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, Yang went to the Gong Wu Stage and had a conflict with Wang Jin (aged thirty-eight, a native of Yangzhou, residing at No. 84 Daide Lane, Chengdu Road), the current head account keeper, over the settlement of accounts. At the time, Wang's older brother, Ah Song, was also present and sided with him. The two sides then began to argue and fight, resulting in injuries to both parties. The police arrested Yang, Wang, teahouse worker Lu Qinghua, and Liu Genshen (aged twenty-nine, a native of Zhenjiang, residing at No. 13 Yongxiang Lane, Zhoujiazui Road, working as an instructor at a dance hall at No. 59 North Sichuan Road), who had accompanied Yang, and brought them all to the police station. Yesterday, they were transferred to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special Court. Judge Qiu Huanxun interrogated them. The police lawyer stated that the defendants were arrested for assault, and the police department needed to investigate further, requesting a postponement of the trial. The plaintiffs, Wang Jin and Lu Qinghua, stated that the defendant Yang Binghua wanted to come and receive a salary, starting with jokes and then arguments. Yang then called in several people and dragged them out to beat them. Yang Binghua stated that Wang Jin was competing for the position of account keeper at the Gong Wu Stage, and he (Yang) mediated a cooperation arrangement, with them voluntarily contributing a share of the payment each month for over a year. Yesterday, when going to settle accounts, a dispute and mutual assault occurred, and his (Yang's) lower body was also injured, requesting an examination. Liu Genshen stated that he stopped to watch at the Gong Wu Stage and was therefore considered an accomplice. Subsequently, both sides' lawyers requested that bail be allowed during the postponement. The court reviewed the statements and ruled for a postponed retrial. The defendants were allowed to provide a guarantor who would ensure their presence when summoned. After the court session, Yang immediately submitted a petition to the prosecutor's office requesting an injury examination.</p>

<p>Jiang Yanze Pharmacy (also known as Jiang Family Pharmacy) outside Xiaonanmen is one of the famous pharmacies in Shanghai. The store has been inherited from ancestors to the present, managed by Jiang Lichuan of the eldest branch. All annual profits are shared by the descendants. Now, Jiang Lian (aged fifty-three) of the third branch, has retained lawyer Xu Xingti to file a lawsuit in the District Court, suing his older brother Jiang Lichuan for seizing jointly owned property and requesting its handover and division. The suit states that the eastern building at No. 44 Licang Bridge Street inside Xiaonanmen, consisting of a hall, wing rooms, and a building, a hall wing room building, and a rear Rongtang wing room building, as well as the hall and seven fen, three li, and six mao of wasteland, originally belonged to the plaintiff, the defendant, the late brother Qiubin, and the deceased younger brother Yuanyü. The defendant is maliciously seizing property, intending to swallow it all. The inheritance of Qiubin should be properly jointly managed, as evidenced by the single note written by the defendant when Qiubin passed away in the ninth year of the Republic. Before his death, the deceased younger brother Yuanyü adopted the plaintiff's son Zhu as his adopted son, and his inheritance should be inherited by the plaintiff's son. The defendant occupies all the houses alone, causing the plaintiff to rent elsewhere, and the rent should be reimbursed. Jiang Lichuan does not recognize the plaintiff's son as Yuanyü's adopted son regarding the inheritance issue. All family property, including the pharmacy, has been passed down from ancestors over two hundred years ago and cannot be divided. As for the plaintiff's residence, he himself did not want to live there and there was no intention of exclusive occupation, but all repair costs are borne by the defendant and should be shared. Yesterday, after Judge Jiang Dade summoned the parties, a retrial was ordered due to incomplete witnesses.</p>

<p>This year, July 6th, is Yu Qiaqing's 70th birthday and the 55th anniversary of his residence in Shanghai. Friends and colleagues had been preparing a celebration and had established a preparatory office at the Shenbo Fellow Townsmen Association.

After the establishment of the committee, it consulted with relevant authorities in the city to discuss methods for organizing the ancestral hall and tombs, and an agreement was reached. As for the organization of public property, it was discovered that Lu Shishan's land in the 24th Bao and 24th Tu had been infringed upon by Lu Dao Cui Li Tixian, etc., in collusion. Attorney Gao Junxiang was specially commissioned to file a lawsuit requesting the return of the property. A report of the situation was previously published. Now the case has been heard three times by the District Court. The court has ruled that the defendants Lu Dao Cui Li Tixian, Song Wenkui, and others are jointly responsible for returning the undisputed land. It is heard that the ancestral hall is making extraordinary efforts to protect public property. There is still much work to be done to organize and deal with matters.

<h3 id="e142">The Hardware Industry in Shanghai By China Credit Editorial Board (Outline of Shanghai Industry and Commerce, No. 27) <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>2. Price Fluctuations of Hardware</p>
<p>The unit of measurement for hardware varies greatly due to the wide variety and different properties of the goods. These units include tons, piculs, bundles, coils, boxes, sheets, etc. Generally speaking, copper, tin, and lead are measured in piculs; steel bars are measured in tons; sheet iron, steel plates, and copper wire are mostly measured in piculs for bulk transactions and in sheets for small quantities. Tinplate is measured in boxes, wire nails are measured in bundles, and lead is measured in coils or piculs. Black sheet iron is measured in bundles or piculs. Other items, such as locks, knives, saws, hinges, and chains, are measured in dozens or grosses. Price fluctuations in the hardware manufacturing market depend on fluctuations in overseas prices. At the same time, the amount of inventory and the strength or weakness of demand are also related to market prices. However, we must also pay attention to exchange rate fluctuations. For example, after October of last year, the exchange rate plummeted, and hardware prices rose sharply accordingly, which is a clear example. As for the quoted prices in transactions, there is no standard market price, so each company often has different prices. The reasons for this are roughly four: first, the amount of each company's inventory; second, different market observations; third, small profits are made quickly; fourth, their own economic conditions. Comprehensive research on the above factors can provide clues to price fluctuations in the hardware market.</p>
<p>3. Current Situation of Hardware Dealers and Manufacturers in this City</p>
<p>The distribution of the hardware industry in this city seems to be somewhat regulated. The hardware stores on Broadway and Seward Road in Hongkou are generally small hardware businesses. The hardware stores on the west side of Tianhougong Bridge, North Suzhou Road, and the area around the intersection of Mingguo Road and Beijing Road are mostly large hardware businesses. The copper and tin industry is located in the French Concession and various locations on Mingguo Road in the southern part of the city. The iron industry is located near Toubalang on the east side of Tianhougong Bridge and various locations in the southern part of the city. Statistics from industry associations show that there are more than a hundred companies in the four industries. In terms of business affiliations, those from Ningbo are the most numerous, followed by those from Wuxi, and then other affiliations. The various situations are described below:</p>
<p>Organization and Capital - Hardware businesses in Shanghai are mostly partnerships, with fewer sole proprietorships, and company organizations are extremely rare. The amount of capital varies greatly depending on the business situation. Businesses dealing in copper and tin range from five or six thousand yuan to forty or fifty thousand yuan, with most ranging from five or six thousand to ten thousand yuan. Iron businesses range from a maximum of thirty or forty thousand yuan to a minimum of four or five thousand yuan, with most ranging from six or seven thousand to ten thousand yuan. Small hardware businesses range from about fifty or sixty thousand yuan at the high end to five thousand to over ten thousand yuan at the low end, with a common range of about ten to twenty thousand yuan. Large hardware businesses range from nearly twenty or thirty thousand yuan for the larger ones to around ten thousand yuan for the medium ones, and three to five thousand yuan for the smaller ones. In general, the capital of most hardware businesses in Shanghai averages from five thousand to ten thousand yuan, accounting for about seven or eight tenths of the industry in the city, with only a few companies having over fifty or sixty thousand yuan.

<p>Qin Furong, the owner of Qin Shunde Hardware Store on Mantingfang, Ma Road, a native of Wuxi, is 34 years old. He was recently sued by Ling Azhao, an 18-year-old woman from Suzhou residing at No. XX Dade Lane, Chengdu Road, through her mother Ling Zhu as her legal guardian. Attorney Li Zhendong filed a lawsuit with the First Special Court, accusing him of obstructing family and violating Articles 227 and 240 of the Criminal Law, and also filed a civil suit requesting payment of 10,000 yuan as solace money. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Risheng opened court in the Eighth Criminal Division for a joint hearing. The defendant Qin Furong arrived with his defense attorneys Wu Yikun and Lu Shidao, while the plaintiff Ling Zhu and Ling Azhao did not arrive. The case was presented by the representative, Attorney Li, who stated that Ling Azhao rented the defendant's spare house, and therefore became acquainted with the defendant. Two years ago, when Azhao was not yet sixteen years old, she was taken by the defendant to a room at the Nanjing Hotel for sexual intercourse. Last year, in March, he rented a room at No. 11, 3rd floor, No. 90 Hengmao Lane, Baxianqiao, French Concession for cohabitation. At that time, Azhao's mother, Ling Zhu, was completely unaware. Later, the defendant suddenly abandoned Azhao. Ling Zhu then found a way to take her back. Therefore, based on the defendant's behavior which has violated the criminal law, they are filing a lawsuit. When questioned, Qin Furong testified that Ling Azhao's uncle, named Azeng, rented his spare house and owed four months' rent. He repeatedly demanded payment without success, so he ordered him to move out last year, resulting in a slight resentment. Azhao occasionally visited her uncle's place, so she got acquainted with him, but there was no relationship. It was found out that Azhao was a tea girl at the Wing On Company, etc. The judge, noting that the plaintiff had not arrived, ordered a retrial on the 7th of next month.</p>

<p>Shi Jiliang, a native of Shaoxing, residing at No. 40 Xinyi Lane, Chang'an Road, Zhabei, had a wife named Ma Xingzhen, 21 years old, also from Shaoxing. She worked at the Chongyang Silk Weaving Factory on Chang'an Road. Recently, Shi Ma Xingzhen had an argument with a male colleague from the factory named Yu Hegui over trivial matters, which escalated into a mutual fight. Ma, being weaker, suffered some humiliation. She was pregnant for several months and had a miscarriage. Her husband, Shi Jiliang, is a good man and did not want to cause trouble, so she had to swallow her anger. Unexpectedly, Yu Hegui, thinking Ma and others were easy to bully, invited ruffians such as Yu Zhuting and others, who arrived in ten rickshaws, to Ma's house and started a dispute with Shi Ma. As a result, Ma was forced to spend seven yuan to offer a table of food as a bribe. Five yuan was for a table of food and two yuan was for firecrackers. Afterwards, she poisoned herself because she had no outlet for her anger. Around 5 a.m. yesterday morning, her husband, Shi Jiliang, discovered her. He called the neighbors to send the young woman to Pushan Hospital on Xinmin Road for treatment. Doctor Jia Shirong examined her and found that she had taken a large amount of raw opium. The poisoning had lasted for a long time, and the poison had spread. She died before receiving treatment. The hospital reported the incident to the Xin Zha Public Security Bureau, which summoned the deceased's husband, Shi Jiliang, to inquire about the situation. Meanwhile, the local guarantor, Shen Xiaowu, reported to the Shanghai District Court and requested an autopsy. Around 3 p.m., Prosecutor Zhao Chuanjia arrived at the hospital and confirmed that the deceased Shi Ma had died of poisoning.</p>

<p>(Beijing News) China's track and field preliminaries for the World Games will be held on the 7th at Shen Park in Shanghai. Committee Chairman John Ma is scheduled to travel to Shanghai on the 3rd to oversee everything. The reporter specially visited Mr. Ma and inquired about the athlete selection methods and objectives. According to him, he was commissioned by the National Sports Association to go to Shanghai to preside over the preliminary competition. With the selection period approaching, he decided to go to Shanghai on the 3rd to oversee everything. As for the selection methods, representative methods, and objectives, there are roughly some regulations. The selection method is only to consider the style of running or jumping and the speed and performance during the preliminary competition. The selection objective is based on individual performance. The external rumors about selecting athletes according to the track and field performance standards announced by the National Sports Association are absolutely incorrect. In addition, the age of the selected athletes and whether their future careers are suitable for long-term training and development are also important criteria. The quota is set at 12 or 16 people, but it is still difficult to determine.</p>
<p>The sports inspection team accompanying the Chinese delegation to the World Games to Germany is scheduled to depart from Shanghai by Italian mail ship on the 26th of this month and is expected to arrive in Berlin on July 22. On September 4, the entire team will return to China and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on September 27. The round trip will take three months. The applications recommended by the provinces and cities, as well as the sports inspectors to Germany subsidized by the National Sports Association, have been reviewed and determined. Li Zhou, the representative of Beijing, and Zhao Wenzao, the sports supervisor of Hebei Province, Xu Yanchao of the Normal University, Xia Xiang of Tsinghua University, and Li Youzhen of Luhe in Tongzhou will travel together to the Ministry of Education in Beijing on the 12th to report, and then go to Shanghai. Zhao Wenzao has returned to Baoding to handle all matters related to going to Germany, and he will come to Beijing in three or four days. The exact amount of Li Zhou's travel expenses to Germany has been set at 2,000 yuan, which has already been allocated.</p>

<p>The only swimming teams in this city organized and managed by Chinese are the Guangdong and Zhongqing swimming teams. The Guangdong team has produced many talented athletes and achieved remarkable results. Recently, the head of the team, Mr. Li Rixin, has returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong to revive the team. The various departments are working hard, and they are currently recruiting members. The team will also organize water polo training classes. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Recruitment of Members: The team leader recently obtained the consent of the swimming pool management to reserve the time from 6:00 AM to 7:30 AM every morning for the team's swimming sessions. All old members of the team will continue to participate, and new members are actively being recruited. The registration period is from the 1st to the 10th of this month, at the team's new office on the third floor of No. 454 Hankou Road, from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. The membership fee is six yuan, and members will enjoy full rights for the year. However, due to various limitations, the number of places is extremely limited. Team members will still be provided with special transportation as in previous years, departing from Xin at 5:45 AM every morning, passing through North Sichuan Road directly to the Municipal Swimming Pool. Detailed rules can be obtained from the team's office.</p>
<p>This Year's Plan: The plans made by the team last year have all been realized one by one. This year, the team will continue to promote the popularization of swimming and improve the level of swimming. High-level and beginner training will continue uninterrupted, and accommodation training will be held. Training equipment will be added to correct the movements of the hands, feet, and body, so that training is aligned with scientific methods. The team also plans to organize long-distance swimming. In addition, a water polo training class will be organized, and team members' performance will be tested weekly, focusing on strength and not being overly concerned with winning championships. The team's officers were newly elected last year, with Mr. Xu Heng as the team leader and Mr. Huang Yuexiong and Mr. Jing Ling as the deputy team leaders.</p>

<h3 id="e178">Unabated Gold Buying Spree Drives Bid Premiums Higher <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Settlement Prices Lower, Swap Rates Soar to $3.80</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market rose again due to foreign reports and news of the situation, which fueled buying interest among those who valued cash and foreign exchange. However, many took the opportunity to sell at the high price, leading to a gradual stabilization after a period of strength. It was observed that the overseas silver market saw a slight contraction in the London market and a flat market in the US in the morning. Floor traders claimed that after the market close, there were Indian and short-covering transactions above the listed price of 0.0625, while China was selling. Forward silver prices in Monterey contracted by one hao to one li six fen. Exchange rates were slightly longer. London spot gold fell by one penny. Reports in Japanese and Western newspapers about the situation further intensified the view of those who valued cash and foreign exchange. A large-scale buying spree appeared immediately upon market opening. The Central Bank's listed prices were announced, with the British and US currencies unchanged, and the customs gold unit unchanged. The standard bid premium price fell further to $1,131.70, but it had little impact. The off-exchange pre-market trading opened, rising to $4344, but there were few sellers. Major players such as Dadecheng, Fuxing, Yongding, and Kang all entered the market, pushing the price up to $4748. The market opened high in the morning, continuing to rise after the opening. Unsecured sellers took advantage of the high prices to move, gradually rising. Later, the price gradually fell as major players sold. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) listed prices were unchanged for both British and US currencies, and the subsequent market fell. After the entry, the silver equalization tax rose sharply by half a cent. Due to uneven supply and demand, the market fluctuated erratically, rising and falling suddenly. After the entry, major players sold their bars, temporarily causing the buying interest to subside, and the market once weakened. However, there were many who sought to maintain the market after the price fell, and the noon close was still balanced. Due to the standard price falling to $31.70, most short sellers were unwilling to settle their positions, also fearing British strength. The foreign exchange swap interest rate increased again, with the discount suddenly rising from $2.50 to $3.80. Here is a record of the half-day market situation:</p>
<p>The morning opening was $1,147.20, up $4.40 from the previous close. Dadecheng and Fuxing advanced to $8, Chunyuan, Yongheng, and Changcheng advanced to $7.70. Yicheng, Dadecheng, Chunyuan, and Yong sold, falling to $5.70. Dingkang, Dadecheng, Huixiang, Yuanmao, and Yonglai advanced again to $7. Dadecheng, Yicheng, Chunyuan, Yongfutai, Yongdingkang, Yuanmaoyong, and Daheng all sold, falling to $5. HSBC's listed prices were firm, with both British and US currencies unchanged, but it had little impact. Qiafengyong, Huixiang, and Dingkang took advantage of the low prices to acquire bars, rebounding to $6.40. The announcement of the silver equalization tax saw a fall of half a cent. At this time, the market fluctuated around $6. Later, Dadecheng, Yuanchangyong, and Chunyuanyong supplied bars, falling to $5.10. Hengyuyuxinxiang, Dingkang, and Dadecheng took the opportunity to buy, rebounding to $7.40. Yuanmaoyong, Dadecheng, Fuxingyong, and Hengyu successively sold, falling to $4.50. Shengyuanyong, Fuxingyong, and Dadecheng bought again, and the noon close rose to $1,146.20. The market was stable after the close.</p>
<p>The settlement price was $1,131.70 based on the Central Bank's standard bid premium price, which, according to the closing price, was about $14 higher than the previous settlement, and $4 higher than the previous close. The registered price for this month was $1,142, and for July it was $1,146. The morning water rate was $1,142. Pure gold was marked up by $5 to $1,152.20. The spot market was stable, with Tianjin goods marked up by $11 and Hechi goods marked up by $10, but there were no transactions. Only the spot bid premium had some transactions, generally $2 lower than the futures price. The Central Bank's standard listing price for swaps fell further to $1,131.70. Generally, short sellers were unwilling to settle in cash, and in view of the settlement price being more than $10 higher, arbitrageurs were also intimidated. There was a lack of lenders in the market, and the lending rate rose. Initially, Qingfayong lent seven bars to Yingfenghong at $3, (at the same time, Yingfenghong settled spot goods at $2.80 lower than the futures price, actually requiring $3.10), Shengyuanyong lent seven bars to Yingfenghong at $3.30, Dadecheng lent 35 bars to Yingfenghong at $3.80, Daheng lent 28 bars to Yicheng at $3.70, Dadecheng lent seven bars to Yicheng at $3.80. Finally, the market remained stable.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was relatively active. In summary, Yuanmaoyong, Wanfeng, Futaiyong, Kangjiuda, Xianghe, Shengyuanyong, Qianchangxiang, Yuyuxinxiang, Dafayong, Hengchangyong, Qianyuanyong, Dingkangshendayong, etc., were on the buying side, while Chunyuanyong, Yicheng, Fuyu, Yongshunmao, Dadecheng, Qiafengyong, Dahenghengyu, Huixiangfuda, etc., were on the selling side. Hengchangyong first bought and then sold, Dadecheng Dingkang first sold and then bought.</p>
<p>The half-day market continued to be strong, with the morning opening at $1,147.20 and the noon closing at $1,146.10. The highest price was $1,148 and the lowest price was $1,144.50, with a fluctuation of $3.50. As a result, the closing was $3.40 better than the previous close. Half-day turnover was 17,010 bars.</p>
<p>For the July period, the long positions included Yuanmaoyong with slightly over 1,000, Tongtaichang with over 900, Daheng with slightly under 900, Hengchangyong with slightly over 800, Shunli with slightly over 700, and Yukangyingxiang and Wanxing with over 600 each.

<h3 id="e179">Strong Chinese Merchants' Appetite, Foreign Exchange Tightens Initially, then Levels Out <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>The exchange market was tight initially, then leveled out yesterday. Chinese merchants' buying appetite remained strong, and banks continued to adjust. In the morning, foreign telegrams reported that the London market saw a contraction of 0.0625 for both near and far terms. Floor traders claimed that after the market close, there were a few transactions above the listed price of 0.0625, with Indian and short covering, and Chinese selling, all at the listed prices. The New York silver market was unchanged. Forward silver prices in Monterey fell by one hao to one li six fen. London spot gold contracted by one penny. The British pound lengthened against the US dollar by two five, the British pound rose against the French franc by three pounds, the US dollar shortened against the British pound by four three seven five, and the US dollar contracted against the French franc by one two five. The Central Bank's listed prices were announced, with the British and US currencies unchanged, and the customs gold unit unchanged. The opening selling prices for the exchange market were 1 shilling 2 pence 375 for the near-term British pound and 29 yuan 9375 for the US dollar, which was flat for the British pound and strong for the US dollar by 0.0625 compared to the previous close, due to large exchange rate spreads. Chinese merchants continued to compete to snap up currencies, and the process was even tighter. When HSBC announced its listed prices, both British and US currencies were unchanged. Banks took advantage of the high prices to fill orders, and the market stabilized. The silver equalization tax was announced to have contracted by half a cent. Thereafter, the three banks continued to forcefully fill spot shilling orders, while foreign banks snapped up spot orders and filled distant orders, also filling US dollar orders. However, due to the strong buying appetite among Chinese merchants, the process remained unstable throughout, lingering until the noon close. The selling prices for the near-term were 1 shilling 2 pence 375 for the British pound and 29 yuan 875 for the US dollar, which was flat for both British and US currencies compared to the previous close. Chinese merchants snapped up a small number of shillings and over 400,000 US dollars. The three banks continued to fill spot shilling orders. Here is a record of the half-day transactions:</p>
<p>For the British pound, the morning opening selling price for the near-term was 1 shilling 2 pence 375. Jiaotong sold to Xinfeng, China sold spot goods to Qixian 375, Hua sold June goods to Dongfang 3125, Da Ying HSBC filled September orders at 0625, Jiaotong sold to Huabi spot goods at 375, Maijiali sold to Huabi August goods at 125 and 1875 as pairs, Youli sold June goods to Huabi at 3125, Youli filled July orders at 1875 and 25 as pairs, Da Ying sold August goods to Huaqi at 3125, Zhongyang sold spot goods to Da Ying and Jiaotong to Maijiali and Zhongyang sold to Huaqi at 375, Maijiali filled August orders at 125.

<h3 id="e180">Frequent Changes in the Securities Environment, Government Bonds Fall Sharply, then Rebound Slightly, Resulting in a Small Drop of 1-2 Jiao to 6.5 Jiao <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, the market sentiment was originally in a state of emptiness, and suddenly there were rumors in the foreign press. For a time, people's hearts were unsettled, resulting in a sharp decline in the midst of a strong selling atmosphere. Although there was a rebound, it was like a flourish of flowers and leaves, only a superficial beauty. We should strive for a permanent foundation from the root. With the abundance of chips and the frequent changes in the environment, the turbulent market price in the future will temporarily remain on a downward curve. Although there are some covering short positions in the market, there is little buying, and the original large positions are in a dilemma. Yesterday, the market opened in the morning with a strong selling atmosphere. Issues 47, 48, and 54 were sold, especially the selling of issue 48 was relentless. The market price fell sharply by 3-5 jiao to 7.5 jiao. In the next round, there was no rebound, and issues 11 and North temporarily saw another surge of selling. However, retail investors did quite a bit of covering short positions, and the market price fell another 2-3 jiao. In the afternoon, issues 10, 35, and 77 all bought in, rebounding by 2-3 jiao. Although the closing was chaotic, most issues were still good by 1-2 jiao. The movement of the market price, every time there is a sharp fall, it is bound to rebound, which has almost become the usual trend of the bond market in recent days. It can be seen that there are many covering short positions, and those who buy on slight dips are indeed numerous. However, the current environment is becoming increasingly dangerous, and it is by no means a few short covering positions that can recover the downward trend. As a result, the market price unanimously trended downward, by 1-2 jiao to 6.5 jiao. The total turnover was 8,927,500 yuan. The comparative list of the results of the rises and falls is listed on the left (unit yuan, trading unit 100 yuan).</p>
<h3 id="e181">Cotton Yarn and American Cotton Rise Along with Sanpin, Covering Short Positions in Marked Yarn is Very Active <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to rise, mainly because world cotton yarn is trending upward across the board, and people's hearts are excited, with floating positions covering short positions. At the same time, the China-Belgium news was peaceful, so there was a lack of new sellers and the market was firm. However, the long positions also came out to cash in when the price rose, so the market situation was still stable, and the rise was gentle. The months of August, September, October, and November all re-emerged outside the 200 yuan mark.</p>
<p>Far-Month Rises 1.34 Yuan</p>
<p>The morning opening of the marked yarn market saw a good American cotton market, and each month rose by 4-5 jiao. However, the second round of opening auction saw a decline in the near-term months, and the auction of the far-term months saw a strong demand. After the second and third rounds, the price rose step by step, but sellers did not surge, and the long positions continued to issue offers, so the upward force was not strong. As a result, each month only rose by 4-6-7 jiao compared to the closing price of the previous day, and this month was unchanged. The market situation was still mediocre after the afternoon opening, and each month fell back by 2-3-4 jiao, because the gold industry helped the long positions to unload, and the sentiment was sluggish. After the second round, the tension gradually increased, the market said that the news in North China was easing, and the Osaka Sanpin yarn was rising steadily. People's hearts were excited, and scattered short positions covered. As a result, each month rose by 4-5-6-7 jiao to 1 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Dafu sold 2,300 packages, Hexing 6 right 50 packages, Shenji 1,600 packages, Renfeng 1,600 packages, Taichang 2,950 packages, Runkang 700 packages, Xiecheng 800 packages, Shengyuan 850 packages, Yongchang 1,100 packages, Yongda 550 packages, and Jinkang 1,000 packages. The buyers were Tongji 1,800 packages, Meiji 800 packages, Dafeng 700 packages, Yinchang 1,250 packages, Gengfeng 3,950 packages, Yichang 1,550 packages, Dachang 1,050 packages, 912,200 packages, and Changfeng 850. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Prices Temporarily Unchanged</p>
<p>The sales of spot yarn are still good. It was found that the total statistics of each help purchased 791 packages throughout the day, and the price was similar to the previous day. The purchase amount of each help is listed below.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Bullish Tendency: Forward New Cotton Becomes Increasingly Lively in the Afternoon <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market tends to rise, but the old cotton situation remains firm with a hint of softness. A large amount of coarse cotton has no way out, while the new cotton market is exceptionally lively. This is mainly because American new cotton futures surged by 27 to 31 points, shocking the market. The situation is increasingly firm, and it is said that the October and November contracts will break through the 40 yuan level.</p>
<p>November Futures Surge by Half a Yuan</p>
<p>Before the official trading began, the market opened due to the surge in American new cotton futures by 27 to 31 points, and a large rise followed by a slight correction in Indian cotton. However, buyers in the market were not enthusiastic, because coarse cotton had no way out, and sellers were also active, leading to a loose market situation and persistent bearish sentiment. As a result, each month's closing price only increased by 5 to 10 cents compared to the previous day's close. The afternoon session opened with a flat market, with fluctuations of 5 cents. However, as the yarn market improved and news about foreign cotton remained firm, more buyers entered the market for forward new cotton, and prices gradually rose. As a result, each month's closing price increased by 1.5 to 2.3 cents compared to the morning close. Sales included 3,100 bales from Juxing, 2,200 bales from Jifeng, 3,600 bales from Gengfeng, 1,100 bales from Renfeng, 1,000 bales from Yicheng, 1,900 bales from Dachangcheng, 2,600 bales from Changfeng, 2,600 bales from Shengyuan, 5,200 bales from Xincheng, 1,400 bales from Xinchang, and 1,800 bales from Yuanxingchang.

<p>July Futures Experience Weaker Gains Due to Hedging Sales and Bull Liquidation</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with positive news from Liverpool. Continued drought in the eastern region and planting delays led speculators to buy. At the same time, bull liquidation and hedging sales were absorbed by both Wall Street and the western region. July futures experienced weaker gains due to hedging sales and bull liquidation. According to reports, the cotton stockpiling location sold 2,000 bales today. The market remained firm and strong throughout the day, with closing prices still firm. Spot prices rose by 1 point, and futures rose by 4 to 31 points. English spot cotton rose by 3 points, and futures rose by 7 to 8 points. Indian cotton continued to be purchased, with spot traders and European exporters selling, but this was absorbed by large speculators. Pulgaon fell by 0.75 to 1 rupee, Oomra fell by 0.75 to 1 rupee, and Broach fell by 0.5 to 0.75 rupee. (Telegraph from the 2nd)</p>
<p>According to a report from Bombay, the opening price forecast for Broach cotton on the 3rd is 212 rupees, a decrease of 0.25 rupee compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>According to a telegraph received by the American An Foreign Firm in Shanghai, the Commodity Credit Corporation has not indicated any intention to sell any portion of its 317,000-bale July cotton futures. There is considerable interest domestically and internationally in new cotton that has been scheduled for shipment. Cotton production conditions in the eastern cotton belt are very poor, but cotton crops in the central and western states are reportedly good.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market situation was such that, due to the rising cotton market overseas and the firmness of yarn and cotton futures on the exchange, factory sentiment became increasingly bullish. However, spot sales have not yet improved. Wholesalers and dyers on this street showed a slightly stronger interest. Yesterday, it was reported that over 300 pieces of fine cloth from brands such as Dongyue, Longtou, Yanghe, Wufu Jixiang, etc., and light and heavy coarse cloth from the Ewo Factory were sold. About 400 pieces of fancy goods such as foreign yarn, striped and plain poplin, printed poplin, and floral cloth were sold. Business in retail stores was also not bad. Factory prices for Dongyue "Four Gentlemen" serge have already been raised by 0.5%. Yesterday, Yuhuo purchased forty to fifty boxes of second-hand goods, and the Tianjin gang purchased about a hundred boxes, with the price per yard also increasing by 0.125 cents.</p>

<p>Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning, showed a trend of initial stability followed by a rise in prices for all months. The quoted prices for foreign wheat were up 0.25 to 0.10 yuan in Chicago, and up 0.10 yuan in Canada. At the opening, the weather had cleared up, and the buying interest was not strong, so the opening prices for all months were slightly down by about 0.01 yuan compared to the previous day. However, factories were watching, and outside speculators were mostly hesitant, so trading was not lively, and prices fluctuated without falling further. When the afternoon session opened, it was initially flat, but then the weather became very hot and humid, raising fears of more rain soon. Reports from various places also indicated heavy rainfall, so buying interest surged, and buyers slightly increased purchases, causing prices for all months to rise uniformly, up 0.01 to 0.02 yuan compared to the morning. It is currently the harvest season for new wheat, and factories will need to see samples from various regions to be certain, so the key to price fluctuations depends on the yield of the year.</p>

<p>Yesterday's wheat market saw a decline of 0.02 to 0.03 yuan in the morning session for all months due to improved weather and slightly softer market sentiment. However, customers from producing areas had many reasons for delays, and dared not make advance sales to collect wheat without having actual goods in hand, to avoid risks. Thus, transactions were scarce and declines extremely small. In the afternoon session, near-term transactions remained quiet, while far-term contracts saw strong buying interest due to the improved flour market. Prices recovered by 0.03 to 0.04 yuan compared to the morning. Reports from various producing areas indicate that the new wheat situation is generally better than last year, but the standard will be difficult to establish when it floods the market. The supply of old wheat is already scarce, with no formal transactions. In another half month, new wheat will enter the market, and the market atmosphere will then become lively.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Fujian merchants continued to purchase Ke Xian rice, and although there was a slight increase in arrivals in recent days, the market remains stable. However, subsequent purchases from Quanzhou are not continuing, with only Fuzhou merchants selectively purchasing early Jianggxi rice and Yuan rice, with purchases of less than 2,000 bags. The upward trend has begun to moderate, and inland merchants have also stopped. This street still has Jiangxi and Anhui rice for social purposes. The market seems to have entered a flat period. Future rises and falls will still depend on the intensity of customer demand. Yesterday, the total transaction volume in the city was 3,300 bags of Jiangxi rice, 1,047 bags of Taiwanese rice, 170 bags of Jing rough rice, with few other transactions. The market situation was similar to the previous day.</p>

<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, the total arrivals from various merchants were only about a dozen (about 2,000 bags of goods). However, sales on this street were weak, with only the Beiyang merchant purchasing over 1,000 bags, so the market for thick and thin Geng rice showed a trend of stability with a hint of fatigue. Du Yang Jian and Yin Bian Yuan were similar.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, arrivals from various merchants in Hexia were not very good, with only fourteen or fifteen arrivals. Sales of various goods in the market, white Geng rice has turned weak and dull, with prices falling slightly by a few cents to nearly a dime. Retail sales of white were still acceptable in the morning market, but turned flat in the afternoon, with prices stable. Sales of high-quality Bo Dao rice continued, while medium and lower grades were sluggish, with market prices for high grades firm and lower grades weak. Various Xian rices were flat and weak, and the prices of other goods were generally stable.</p>

<h3 id="e195">Two Scholars of Xinhui <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Su Zihan</p>
<p>Ruan Danian was a scholar of Xinhui County, Guangdong, at the end of the Chongzhen reign of the Ming Dynasty. He was very poor and had no good clothes to wear. He ignored the ridicule of others. He was not an extraordinary figure among scholars, but he was very filial to his mother. When his mother died, he had no money to hire a mud worker, so he buried his mother himself by plastering earth. He went to her grave to cry every day, and this continued for three years.</p>
<p>Li Zicheng broke into Beijing, and the news that Emperor Chongzhen had hanged himself on Coal Hill reached Xinhui. Ruan Danian cried bitterly for several days and did not eat or drink for days. Then he had a thought: "It is not worth dying like this; I will die when it is worth dying!" So he resumed eating and drinking.</p>
<p>At that time, someone said to Ruan Danian: "I heard that when the rebel Yan entered the capital, many ministers surrendered and are still high officials. Why don't you go? Why suffer here?"</p>
<p>Ruan Danian sighed, "These people have no conscience. I only want to die!"</p>
<p>Ruan Danian did not want to die for a while because he wanted to do his best to restore the Ming Dynasty. When he heard someone advising him to surrender to the rebels, he became even more angry and immediately gathered his neighbors, wanting to start an uprising in Xinhui. But those people were too timid and had no loyalty, and no one would do it. Ruan Danian worked hard for several days with no result. He was extremely angry and sailed a small boat to Yamen. He went ashore to the Temple of Empress Yang, knelt on the ground, and cried loudly. The fishermen living on the coast of Yamen heard someone crying in the temple and ran to see. Seeing Ruan Danian crying so sadly, some people unconsciously shed tears, and some people went to advise Ruan Danian.</p>
<p>Ruan Danian stopped crying when he was hoarse, stood up, and saw that these fishermen were so easily moved. He felt it was an opportunity and could not let it pass easily. He said to the fishermen, "Do you know that the Emperor has been killed by the rebel?"</p>
<p>The fishermen were surprised and said, "We don't know. Who is this rebel?"</p>
<p>Ruan Danian said, "The rebel is named Li Zicheng, and he is a great robber. He rapes, kills, and burns everywhere, and has killed countless people. He has already broken into the capital and forced the Emperor to death. We are people of the Great Ming and should avenge the Emperor. Those officials only know how to make money. If we want to kill the rebels and take revenge, we must rely on ourselves. My strength alone is too small to accomplish anything. You are all people of the Great Ming, all loyal and righteous people. Let us unite and kill the rebels!"</p>
<p>Ruan Danian became more and more impassioned, and the fishermen also became angry, all clenching their fists and wanting to go immediately. Ruan Danian came out and quietly observed the fishermen, noticing several spirited young men. He told them what to do and then, after a few days, they agreed on a date to gather by the sea. There were one hundred and ten fishing boats and more than four hundred strong men. Ruan Danian used military tactics to organize them and set the date for the uprising for the next day.</p>
<p>At the same time, there was another scholar in Xinhui named Li Zichu. He was very rich, and whenever there was a bad harvest, he would take out his own money to help the poor, so many people were grateful for his kindness. When he heard the news of Chongzhen's death, he wrote a "Great Bamboo Emperor" memorial tablet, placed it in the family temple, and led his family to offer sacrifices and cry. Like Ruan Danian crying at the Temple of Empress Yang in Yamen, many people came to watch.</p>
<p>After Li Zichu finished crying, he stood up and said to everyone: "The Great Ming has been in power for three hundred years since Emperor Gao pacified the world. Our ancestors have received many benefits from the country for generations. Now the rebel has forced the Emperor to death. The ministers usually only know how to play around, and when there is a crisis, they surrender to the rebels, bringing the country to this point. If we, the people, do not unite to save the country, we will only go to hell day by day. We live as people of the Great Ming, and we die as ghosts of the Great Ming. Isn't that the right thing to do? But we must die worthily. Let us all find a place where it is worth dying!"</p>
<p>Before Li Zichu could finish speaking, a burly man in his thirties jumped out of the crowd and shouted, "If Mr. Li wants to save the country, we are willing to follow him, through fire and water together. Whoever changes his mind halfway is not born of human parents!"</p>
<p>Li Zichu said: "These are my good friends and good people of the country. Among our relatives and friends, there are still many loyal and righteous people. Please ask everyone to persuade them. The more people, the better."</p>
<p>In just over ten days, he got more than five hundred people. Li Zichu used all sorts of words of loyalty and righteousness to persuade the bandits in Xinhui County, and the bandits agreed to join the cause of saving the country. This brought the total to more than one thousand six hundred people.</p>
<p>Li Zichu heard that Ruan Danian was in Yamen and brought these more than one thousand people to Yamen.</p>
<p>These two scholars, filled with loyalty and righteousness, met in Yamen, and when they met, they embraced each other and cried loudly. The soldiers in the army were overwhelmed with emotion and wished they could kill the rebels immediately.</p>
<p>Ruan Danian stopped crying first and said to Brother Li: "The ministers have acted recklessly and ruined the country. Our wise Emperor also died at their hands. The country has reached this point. Fortunately, the hearts of the people have not died. You and I are just scholars, but with a call to arms, we have gathered so many loyal and righteous people. There is still hope for the country!"</p>
<p>Li Zichu also stopped crying and said, "Yes! The hearts of the people have not died, and the country can still be restored. Now that two emperors have already been established in the two capitals, we should still go to Nanjing to persuade the King; that is better than here."</p>
<p>The two asked everyone what they thought, and everyone was willing to go to Nanjing.</p>
<p>Ruan Danian and Li Zichu led these more than one thousand people onto boats, planning to go to sea to Shanghai, and then up the Yangtze River to Nanjing.</p>
<p>One day, a great wind rose at sea, and the waves, following the wind, rose and fell like mountains, rolling back and forth. Ruan Danian and Li Zichu's fleet of boats were drilling in and out, losing contact with each other. The wind blew harder and harder, and the waves grew bigger and bigger. How could these wooden boats withstand such a storm? They struggled against the wind with all their might, but it was no use. Many boats had already been overturned by the waves, and the bottoms of the boats were like upturned watermelon rinds, floating back and forth in the vast sea. The sea was full of corpses, floating there with the waves.</p>
<p>Although many boats had capsized, Ruan Danian and Li Zichu still struggled desperately against the storm, trying their best to keep their boats from capsizing in the mountain of waves.</p>
<p>The wind blew for a day and a night before it gradually stopped, and the waves subsided. Ruan Danian and Li Zichu collected the boats that had not capsized, and when they counted, they had already lost more than half, leaving only three to five hundred people. But they were still not discouraged and still led these people towards Nanjing.</p>
<p>That day, they reached Chongming Island and knew that they had arrived at the Yangtze River, but they also learned that Shi Kefa had died and Nanjing had fallen. The remaining three to five hundred people heard this news and knew that the situation was over. Some scattered, leaving only a few dozen people. Ruan Danian and Li Zichu had no choice but to dismiss these dozens of people and return to Xinhui.</p>
<p>Soon, emperors were established in Fujian and Zhejiang, but Ruan Danian and Li Zichu decided to go to Ganzhou.</p>
<p>When they were about to leave, everyone advised them: "Now that the rebel has died and the Qing Dynasty has occupied most of the country, what can Li Suiqiu accomplish alone? Why go!" The two did not listen and still went to Ganzhou.</p>
<p>When they arrived in Ganzhou and met Li Suiqiu, Li Suiqiu asked, "Why have you two come to see me? What can I do for you?"</p>
<p>Ruan Danian and Li Zichu answered in unison: "We have come to the General to find a place where it is worth dying."</p>
<p>Soon, the Qing army arrived in Ganzhou and attacked day and night without rest. Thanks to Li Suiqiu's desperate support, he held out for a few days. But the Qing army's momentum was too strong, and eventually they could not hold out. The city was broken, and the Qing soldiers poured into the city like a tide. Li Suiqiu fought the Qing soldiers in street battles, exhausted his strength, and died in battle!</p>
<p>Ruan Danian and Li Zichu saw the city fall and Li Suiqiu die in battle from the city wall. They drew the short knives from their sides and shouted to the sky, "Ancestors in heaven, your little servants have the opportunity to repay the country today, and it is worth dying!" The two flew down the city and stabbed the Qing soldiers, who were like a tide, killing several in a row. The Qing soldiers were initially surprised, but then saw that they were two scholars and did not take them seriously. They raised their knives and spears together, and in an instant, Ruan Danian and Li Zichu were chopped into mincemeat under the chaos of knives and spears.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Alfred Nobel 1833-1896 — Inventor of Dynamite <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— (Guo Xuan)</p>
<p>Isn't everyone afraid of modern warfare? What was it that flattened Zhabei in Shanghai? Why do we feel uneasy whenever we hear a buzzing sound overhead? Why are we afraid of others and afraid to compete with them?</p>
<p>I think what we fear are their powerful weapons, the weapons we don't have!</p>
<p>These are not the days of broadswords and spears. A sixteen-inch cannon can fire a ton (over sixteen hundred catties!) of shells, and within seven miles (about thirty li), it can penetrate a foot of steel plate. What kind of person can withstand this? What kind of house can withstand this? During the European War, German soldiers forcibly passed through Belgium to attack France. The Belgians built extremely sturdy fortresses in Antwerp, budgeting for three months of defense. Unexpectedly, within eleven days, all the solid stones on the fortresses were turned into dust by German cannons, and the city had to surrender! What about airplanes? Isn't it the same? Large bombs generally weigh a ton. When that thing falls from the sky, it's like the sky is falling and the earth is splitting! A 240-pound bomb already amazes us with its power – I'm afraid even ordinary cellars can't withstand its force! – Let alone one weighing over a thousand catties!</p>
<p>What gives it such great power? – It's dynamite!</p>
<p>Speaking of dynamite, we are ashamed. This thing was invented by us Chinese! It is said that during the Sui Dynasty in China (about 1500 years ago), gunpowder was already known for performing magic tricks. By the Song Dynasty, it was used in warfare. But even now, we are still only using the charcoal gunpowder in "firecrackers" and "firework boxes," and there has been no progress. Westerners, however, have taken it and are bullying us! When we celebrate the New Year with firecrackers, have we ever thought that this thing contains so much potential?</p>
<p>The reason why gunpowder can generate great force is simple: it is originally a liquid or solid, but when subjected to force, electricity, or impact, it suddenly turns into a gas, and its volume increases many times over. For example, if you put some gunpowder in a house, it can blow open the windows and break the doors once it explodes. Imagine how powerful it would be if it were confined in a small gun barrel! Modern gunpowder is much more powerful than ancient gunpowder, because modern chemistry is developing faster and faster, and people know how to choose raw materials with greater explosive power to make gunpowder. The Nobel I want to talk about is the one who improved gunpowder and increased its power.</p>
<p>Originally, gunpowder was not only used for killing people, but it could also be used for beneficial human endeavors such as mining and road construction. For example, when a train encounters a mountain and needs to build a tunnel, how could it be done with manpower alone? At this time, a large amount of dynamite must be used. For example, the Mont Cenis Tunnel between France and Italy began work in 1857. At first, old black powder was used for blasting, and it was estimated that it would take 24 years to complete. Later, a powerful explosive was invented, and the project was completed eleven years ahead of schedule. You see, isn't dynamite also a way to benefit mankind? It just depends on how humans use it.</p>
<p>Nobel was from Sweden, a cold country in Northern Europe. The people of this country mostly possess strong and resilient characters, and Nobel was no exception. His father was a mechanic, so his family environment could be said to be close to science from an early age. But his father did not intend to make him a gunpowder inventor, but wanted him to continue his own career. Therefore, after graduating from middle school, he was sent to the Faculty of Engineering at St. Petersburg University in the Russian capital to study mechanics. Nobel graduated from university at the age of twenty-two.</p>
<p>At this time, a French Brigadier General named Picquet was very famous for his research on explosives. Picquet was originally an arms manufacturer, and he wanted to find a way to increase the firing range of bullets, so he studied improving gunpowder. Originally, the composition of early gunpowder was nothing more than a mixture of charcoal, saltpeter, sulfur, and other things. Although it could explode, the power was very small. After the news of Picquet's research on gunpowder spread in the newspapers, it aroused Nobel's interest. Because when he was in college, he had already begun to pay attention to the research of nitroglycerin, a raw material for making new explosives.</p>
<p>But Nobel's motivation for studying explosives was not to help humans fight wars, but to stand on the position of helping humans build. He stayed in the laboratory day and night, trying to realize his ideal. His parents did not approve of his intense actions, and many relatives and friends advised him. Some even thought that he was pursuing a shadowless dream. We can say that Nobel, like other inventors, encountered many setbacks at first. But he was not discouraged. Every day, he faced those extremely strong chemicals, such as nitric acid, sulfuric acid, etc. His clothes were burned with large and small holes, and sometimes his skin was scorched. Naturally, before his invention was successful, everyone's ridicule of him only became more and more severe.</p>
<p>Nobel buried himself in hard work in the laboratory, and two or three years passed in an instant. He was so tired that he was as thin as a rake and his spirit was withered, but there was still no solution to what he hoped for. Sometimes he worked until midnight alone, accompanied only by the cold moonlight. Everyone else was sleeping sweetly. When this great scientist saw his desolate situation, he couldn't help but shed a few tears.</p>
<p>He believed that "nitroglycerin" must have extremely violent explosive properties and could be made into a powerful explosive, but he failed hundreds of times. Later, he realized that it was not the problem of nitroglycerin, but the imperfection of the fuse. So he tried to improve the fuse again, which took him a long time, and the result was also a failure. He then improved the fuse into a detonator, spending a lot of effort, but still to no avail! He was a bit confused.</p>
<p>Finally, he thought of using a chemical called mercury fulminate and putting it into the detonator, which might be effective, so he began to install it. But when would it ignite? After ignition, would it really explode? He was still doubting himself when suddenly, bang, bang, bang, bang, a world-shattering sound came from in front of him! Everything he had been experimenting with flew out of the house! All that was visible was a white fog.</p>
<p>When the family heard the loud noise, they knew that something had gone wrong. When they came out to take a look, they saw black smoke coming from Nobel's laboratory. The roof of the house was gone, and many sundries were scattered on the ground, emitting burning smoke. His parents rushed inside, regardless of their own lives, and only then did they pull Nobel out, covered in blood. Everyone was shocked to see his pitiful appearance! But Nobel said calmly: "Don't be afraid! I won't die! ... Ah! My work is successful! Successful! ... Quick, give me a glass of water, I'm so thirsty!" Someone immediately poured him water. After he drank it, his spirits rose even more. His two hands, filled with blood, danced involuntarily. He was like a madman, spinning and dancing around the house, yelling; it turned out that he had been locked in this room for a full six years! (This was already 1864)</p>
<p>Nobel's nitroglycerin gunpowder was invented, and the whole world was shaken, because this thing's explosive power was many times greater than that of old gunpowder! The Swedish government specially granted him a manufacturing patent, and he received special protection from the governments of Britain, Germany, and France. Thus, Nobel's assets accumulated day by day, and the world's great projects saved countless time and effort. Who in the world doesn't praise his contribution!</p>
<p>But nitroglycerin is a liquid, which is extremely inconvenient and dangerous to transport. Nobel spent a lot of thought and solved this problem again. He mixed "kieselguhr" with nitroglycerin to form a soft substance, which is the famous military "dynamite." Later, he invented nitrocellulose, which is made by soaking cotton in nitric acid. It is a gelatinous substance, and its explosive power is much greater than that of dynamite, so it is also called "blasting gelatin" (this was in 1878). This also obtained a government-granted patent.</p>
<p>Since Nobel's invention of gunpowder, the industrial demand has become more and more frequent. In 1867, he only produced eleven tons, but in 1870, it increased to 420 tons. In 1877, it was 5,500 tons, and in 1882, it reached tens of thousands of tons. Nobel naturally made a fortune and became a world-renowned scientist. But there was one thing that caused him great pain, that is, the gunpowder that was originally intended to benefit mankind was gradually being used in self-destructive wars! Countries were all trying to manufacture gunpowder, and weapons were also being improved. In short, the methods of killing people were faster, more economical, and more cruel! This was not Nobel's original intention at all! When he was on his deathbed, he regretted his sins very much. He had eighteen million yuan in inheritance, and in order to atone for his sins, he donated all of it to the country to organize a Nobel Foundation to manage it. The annual interest earned is awarded to people from all countries who have made contributions to physics, chemistry, physiology, or literature. In addition, people who are committed to reducing armaments and world peace are also eligible for awards. Each category is limited to one person per year, and they can receive about 80,000 yuan. This is the world-renowned Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>Nobel lived to be sixty-three years old and died with endless regrets!</p>

<p>— Du Xiu</p>
<p>—Standardize Book Prices Nationwide—</p>
<p>The publishing world, on the one hand, is to maintain the livelihood of a part of the people, and at the same time, it undertakes a department. Originally, it can be explained by the eight characters of "I am for everyone, everyone is for me," but in terms of comparability, there is indeed a difference in urgency and importance. For example, in the publishing world, it not only has the obligation to pass on the talents and knowledge of the predecessors to the present and the future, but also can promote the progress of this era and promote the upward development of this culture!</p>
<p>At the same time, in every department of this present society, there are unreasonable phenomena. This unreasonable phenomenon may bring a little benefit to a small number of people in a certain department, but it is a poison to the public. This situation is prevalent in every place and every profession line in this world. The publishing world is certainly no exception.</p>
<p>Only the publishing world has too profound an impact on the people, only the mission undertaken by the publishing world is too important, therefore, we demand that the publishing world eliminate its unreasonable phenomena, and it is becoming more urgent. The Ministry of Education's order to the national publishing world to standardize the catalog of books is probably here, and the Shanghai Book Industry Association first obeyed the order to do so, probably also.</p>
<p>In the past, publishers often set the price of books very high, and the discounts were also very large. Therefore, in the recent economic downturn, books with 20% discounts have emerged endlessly. The operators of books can be said to have lost their business ethics, and the buyers of books, of course, are deceived. Therefore, the sluggish sales of books and the pie button of culture are also expected.</p>
<p>It is now scheduled to start on July 1 of this year. All books will be printed with the actual price, and there will be certain regulations for low-priced pre-orders. From now on, all bookstores can reduce many unnecessary competitions, improve commercial ethics, and earnestly serve the culture, and the general readers will not be deceived.</p>
<p>The author firmly believes that this unprecedented major change in the publishing world is the prelude to the brilliant start of the entire Chinese cultural world!</p>

<p>— Wu Qiyun</p>
<p>Written by Fang Qiudong, World Publishing</p>
<p>In the preface of Mr. Fang Qiuwei's book "The Problems of Kang, Tibet, Yunnan, and Guangxi in the Future," we read the following painful confession: "Before the September 18th Incident, I tried to write about the Northeast problem, but no one paid attention to it; after the September 18th Incident, I tried to write about the North China problem, and similarly, very few people paid attention to it; on the contrary, it was the Japanese who paid attention to my writing..." A researcher with relatively excellent vision, his labor cannot get the attention of the general public, but is paid attention to and researched by the friendly country of Japan. This is really the greatest sadness!</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Fang Qiuwei's book "The Problems of Kang, Tibet, Yunnan, and Guangxi in the Future" has been completed again. Assuming that the book still does not get the attention of the Chinese people, but is used as a reference by countries such as Britain, France, Japan, and Russia, then if it continues to be so confused forever, the Northeast has already been lost in the past, and the Southwest problem may follow. What else can be said about the sinking of China? Then the sadness of the author alone is just a trivial matter!</p>
<p>In Chinese history, the border provinces have always adopted a policy of appeasement. As long as they do not rebel, do not make trouble, and do not resist, and achieve the so-called "coming to court every year and paying tribute every year," they will be satisfied. This policy was originally not too critical in the era of closure, because with the vast territory of China, the underdevelopment of transportation, the lack of education, the differences in folk customs, and the differences in ethnic characters, it was not realistic to hope that the power of the central government would directly reach the remote provinces. However, this bad policy of appeasement is okay as a temporary expedient, but not as an unchanging policy for all ages; it is okay in the era of closed-door self-preservation, but it is not okay now. The reason why Kang, Tibet, Yunnan, and Guangxi are full of the power of countries such as Britain and France is because the central government of our country has always adhered to the policy of appeasement.

<p>— Zhang Tianyou</p>
<p>Edited by Yang Youjiong and Fu Biao, China Publishing</p>
<p>Man is a political animal. This saying, from the establishment of the country to the infinite future, the author dares to assert that it will never shake its firmly established conclusion. Because prestige is always a person in a society, it is impossible to live in isolation and satisfy one's own life requirements. Because life requires the division of labor and cooperation of the public, the country is established, and politics is produced. So whether you like politics or hate politics, this political system is always affecting the general public; these political laws are always dominating the general public. For thousands of years in our country, in the era of monarchical autocracy, the general self-history Qinggao people often regarded not asking about politics as transcendence, but how could these hermits who hated politics escape the domination of national laws and political systems? It is the most ridiculous thing to be ruled by the political system and regard not asking about politics as Qinggao. Until the early Republic of China, Mr. Wang Jingwei once put forward the so-called Three No's Doctrine, one of the "Three No's" is not to be an official. The reason why Mr. Wang did not want to be a citizen was nothing more than to show Qinggao. However, if you do not become an official, the warlords of the Yuan Shikai family will become officials. As a result, because of the lawlessness of the rulers, there will still be a Yuan-seeking movement. In the Republic of China in the seventeenth year, Mr. Wang only became an official; here, it must be specially explained that the author's so-called interfering in politics does not mean that you must be an official to interfere in politics; and the so-called not being an official by the general Qinggao people in the past includes the entire meaning of not interfering in politics, so the author believes that Mr. Wang's slogan of "not being an official" in the early Republic of China, which includes the entire meaning of "not interfering in politics," has room for discussion. There is also our Dr. Hu Shi, who initially believed that interfering in politics was not Qinggao, but as a result, he said: "I want to escape politics, but politics is always following me, not letting go." (The general idea is like this, I don't remember the original text.) In the past two or three years, Mr. Hu Shi's political essays have been published from time to time, which shows that people are ultimately social animals and political animals!</p>
<p>In the past, the author believes that the strange phenomenon of hating politics can be explained in the following three points: First, the power of government and the power of governance were completely in the hands of the emperor alone. The emperor's words were the law and the order, and the people were not allowed to interfere; second, the wind of competition, corruption, meanness, and filth on the road to officialdom made the general self-respecting people discouraged, so they were unwilling to ask about politics; third, the relationship between the government and the people at that time was very shallow. In addition to the obligation to pay grain and taxes, the good and bad of politics had little to do with the general law-abiding and self-respecting people. The so-called "the sky is high and the emperor is far away," who can control who?</p>
<p>But now, social life is becoming more and more complex, economic development is becoming more and more strict, the level of education is becoming more and more universal and improved, and the idea of civil rights has reached the ends of the earth. The relationship between politics and the people is certainly not as shallow as in the past autocratic era. Therefore, the general public is concerned about politics and intervenes in politics, just like daily clothing.</p>

<h3 id="e200">A Difficult Problem in the League of Nations <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Jing</p>
<p>The difficult problems that are now gathered in front of us are ten times or a hundred times greater than the League of Nations, but we put them aside and do not talk about them, and go to talk about the difficult problems of the League of Nations that are completely irrelevant, to talk about how he is? No, we also thought that this League of Nations was a "big Bodhisattva who always responds to requests." Since the September 18th Incident, we have also gone to ask for advice and beg for help, but in the end, it is like drawing a lottery in the Red Temple, drawing a low lottery. In addition, we absolutely cannot get any influence.</p>
<p>In the September 18th Incident, we had already recognized the League of Nations for the first time. In the Italy-Abyssinia War, Abyssinia also went to "draw a lottery" in the same way. In the end, "only sincerity is spirit," and we actually drew a top lottery, getting a lot of comfort and face, but Abyssinia was finally destroyed, and the Abyssinian king also fled. This is our second time to recognize the League of Nations. The current difficult problem of the League of Nations is not other, but the aftermath of the Italian invasion of Abyssinia. Although it is the aftermath, it is indeed very difficult to deal with this problem. What is the problem? That is, the sanctions against Italy should be lifted.</p>
<p>When the Italy-Abyssinia war broke out, the League of Nations immediately decided to recognize Italy as an aggressor country and decided that sanctions should be imposed on Italy and implement measures. Now that Abyssinia is dead and Italy has announced Abyssinia as an Italian colony, the difficult problem of the League of Nations lies here. Should we continue to impose sanctions? I am afraid that it will cause future disputes. Should we lift the sanctions? In terms of the face of the League of Nations, it is also unreasonable. This problem does require research. It is indeed a pain that "it is difficult for me to be a person on the left and right."</p>
<p>The League of Nations cannot solve this problem, and it originally wanted to delay it, but Argentina, which likes to joke, suddenly asked the League of Nations to convene a conference earlier. The Argentine government originally had close relations with Italy, so Argentina was not enthusiastic when the League of Nations decided to sanction Italy. Therefore, the current request for the League of Nations to convene a conference earlier is also to help Italy, or it is said that it was indirectly initiated by Italy, and it is also credible that it will take the opportunity to urge the cancellation of sanctions in the future. On the one hand, Italy used propaganda methods, saying that if the current sanctions measures cannot be lifted before June 15, Italy should withdraw from the League of Nations. On the other hand, Italian Ambassador to the UK Grandi visited Foreign Secretary Eden to do preliminary work to ease the relations between the two countries. One hard and one soft, threat and lure, the two are advancing in parallel, which is a good diplomatic method.</p>
<p>However, what about the United Kingdom? If we want to be tough to the end, on the one hand, we are afraid that the League of Nations will die here and cannot be maintained. On the other hand, we are afraid of causing trouble, which is no small matter. It is really impossible to be tough. Therefore, there is indeed a possibility of understanding between the two countries, that is, the problem of canceling sanctions measures can also be solved. As for the solution path? According to the British Observer, it is only necessary to modify the agreement established between the United Kingdom and Italy in December 1925, (the agreement stipulates that the Lake Tana area in western Abyssinia is within the sphere of influence of the United Kingdom,) and replace the words of the Emperor of Abyssinia in the agreement with the words of the Italian government. In other words, the British government only needs to have the right of transfer that it requires, and the Italian government will voluntarily give it to the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>If we look at this piece of news, the United Kingdom only needs to obtain the area around Lake Tana in western Abyssinia as the sphere of influence of the United Kingdom, and it can lift the sanctions. If so, the United Kingdom used to help Abyssinia, but it turned out to be helping itself. As long as it gets the rights and protects the rights, the other faces can also be abandoned. The League of Nations that I used to know only thought that it was "the League of Nations is useless." The League of Nations that I now know is actually a "spoils-sharing" League of Nations. In the future, small and weak countries must realize that they must strive for self-improvement and strive for self-salvation. The League of Nations is originally a decoration in the world, and it is a black yamen in a dark mass.</p>
<h3 id="e201">The Story of a Horse <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Xia Lisi</p>
<p>That year, I was wandering around the Malay Peninsula. From one metropolis to another, sometimes even getting a meal was a problem, so I endured hunger on the streets. One day, I was so hungry that I couldn't bear it any longer. On the street, I kept looking greedily at the doorways of every food store. That sly and despicable Indian Ah Sam began to notice me, following me relentlessly. So, I crossed the bridge over the small slope, went to the wilderness with a frightened heart, wiped the sweat from my forehead, calmed down, and lay down on a patch of grass.</p>
<p>The sun was bright, piercing my eyes. I was exhausted, but I couldn't fall asleep. I lay there for a while, and then a horse came, grazing not far from me with its head down. The surroundings were very quiet, and the sound of it chewing grass could be heard clearly. Because of this, I was once again threatened with having nothing to eat one day. So I sat there silently watching the horse. It was very strong and must be well-nourished. Somehow, I felt a touch of envy toward it. At this moment, two people came rushing from afar, obviously looking for their horse. When they discovered it was here, they shouted with joy:</p>
<p>"It's here!"</p>
<p>For some reason, they suddenly showed me their kindness. Maybe they thought I was guarding the horse for them? Seeing my hungry appearance, they took me and the horse away together. Not far from this grassland, their stable could be seen. From their conversation, I understood that this horse was in training and would definitely participate in the big race on the Malay Peninsula in three months. Along the way, they talked about various aspects of the horse, and then suddenly asked if I wanted a job. In my state of hunger and cold, how could I refuse? So, the next day, I became a small errand boy in the stable.</p>
<p>Among the dozen or so horses, I always had a slight fondness for the horse I met on the grassland. Its name was Napoleon. Every morning, I led Napoleon outside for a stroll, letting the morning breeze blow on it and the sun shine on it. When it was happy, it would stretch its neck and whinny, its brown hair flowing to both sides, showing a kind of majestic air. One day, the owner saw it and laughed so hard that he couldn't close his mouth, exclaiming:</p>
<p>"Napoleon, you're really something!"</p>
<p>The owner was a British devil, with the demeanor of a gentleman, holding a walking stick and a telescope around his neck. As the race drew near, he took Napoleon to the racetrack and had the jockey run for him to see. Then he took out his stopwatch and watched very carefully. As soon as the gun went off, Napoleon ran forward, its hooves kicking up dust, making a clattering sound as it sped around the field. Everyone was very tense at this time, and even though the owner was very satisfied after it finished running, he still kept grumbling, telling us to take good care of it and intensify the training. At the same time, he introduced Napoleon in the newspapers, exaggerating that Napoleon would surely dominate this year!</p>
<p>In two days, it would be the day of the race. That night, it was very hot and stuffy at first. Then, in the middle of the night, a torrential rain began to fall. After watching Napoleon settle down, I closed my eyes to rest in a corner of the stable. I even had a dream, dreaming that Napoleon won first place in the Malay Peninsula race, and 100,000 people cheered for it! But when I woke up, what...</p>
<p>Napoleon was gone!</p>
<p>It had been stolen. Because those people feared that Napoleon would win their championship in the race, they did such a thing. Our owner just kept biting on his cigar, but didn't light it. After biting the cigar to pieces, he spat a mouthful of phlegm into the spittoon. He also called the police station: "You must find Napoleon within twenty-four hours!" he sternly ordered.</p>
<p>Naturally, I was kicked out of the stable that day. The life of wandering and starving returned, but I missed Napoleon. On the day of the race, I specially went to the racetrack crowded with thousands and thousands of people, wanting to know about Napoleon's news. But my ragged appearance aroused the interference of the Indian Ah Sam again, not allowing me to approach the entrance. Thus, in the midst of the deafening shouts, I stood outside and eagerly asked a person:</p>
<p>"Sir, is Napoleon running?"</p>
<p>"No! Washington got first place." That was his reply.</p>

<h3 id="e202">A Day in a Cigarette Factory <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Lai</p>
<p>At seven o'clock, the sun had already climbed into our dormitory. Looking out from the steel window, I could see a distant corner, and the tall chimney stood out vividly before my eyes. Many factories were sounding their whistles, wuwu—this sound was already urging me. I quickly washed my face. The oily substance stuck to my yellow-black face was strangely sticky, and it was hard to wash it clean. However, in this cigarette factory, I was immersed in an atmosphere of tobacco mixed with hemp wine all day and night. Although I am not a person who smokes cigarettes, I have become like a demon stained with the smell of tobacco.</p>
<p>It wasn't time to start work yet. In fact, it wouldn't be officially work time until nine o'clock. What should I do? I am a very unfamiliar clerk. So, I ran around the huge factory like an inspector. However, I really like to go to various departments to observe in the morning, especially before work starts, when there is plenty of time. However, maybe people will say that I am a person who likes to be around girls, but I always feel that when I am close to them, a secret pain rises in my heart.</p>
<p>Look at this vast factory; rows and rows of seats are laid out. This is just one cigarette-packing department, and there are a thousand seats. When I ran into this brightly lit workshop, the girls who were already seated were talking and laughing. They didn't have work to do yet. This is a habit. They wait for work like this every morning. However, these more than a thousand seats now only accommodate about five hundred female workers. Moreover, they are not long-term workers. They are paid for one day's work, and they earn no more than twenty cents for a full day's work. Comparing them to me, there is a really big difference. However, I am an accountant who earns ten dollars a month, and I have to do nine hours of troublesome accounting every day. Comparing myself to those big shots who get paid for doing nothing, there is an even bigger gap. Really, every morning when I come here, I always feel a little sad.</p>
<p>Most of the four or five hundred girls are dressed up very nicely. I don't quite understand this. Even if they have work to do every day, working from day to night, even working a full twenty hours, they earn no more than eight or nine dollars a month. They still have to eat, so where do they get the money to look so good? Red lips, faces covered in fragrant powder, colorful clothes. Sometimes, groups of three or five gather in a corner, talking and laughing, pushing and shoving each other. Of course, if the foreman comes, they become as silent as if they were being suppressed, even furrowing their brows.</p>
<p>"Hey! Mr. Li, will work start today?" When I walked in, they asked me eagerly, their eyes wide with hope. Some were even eating bowls of cold rice, cold noodles, or similar things.</p>
<p>"Yes, someone ordered goods yesterday, so we have to rush to work today and tomorrow!"</p>
<p>I said, exhaling, and walked past. Their chattering voices, mixed with laughter, rose again. However, if I answered them that there was no work, they would definitely lower their heads sadly, sigh, and prepare to go home.</p>
<p>As usual, I finished walking through every part of the factory and returned to the office. Then, the roaring sound of the machines was continuously broadcast from every part of the factory. Five or six hundred workers were busily and quietly doing their mechanical work. As for me, wasn't I still mechanically doing my many troublesome accounts? Before, there were ten accountants, but now there are only three. Moreover, one of them is old and confused, and he often messes up the numbers and asks for help. Really, I am almost responsible for doing all the accounting work for the entire factory. You think, aren't I so busy that I can't even breathe? So, once I get to the office, my brain is no longer free.</p>
<p>After lunch, we heard that a worker in the baking room had fallen ill and was immediately sent to the hospital. I heard that he was suffering from scarlet fever. However, I heard a little about that worker. He was a person who drifted to Shanghai from Shandong, without relatives or friends. He came to our factory a year ago to do baking room work. This person, who was as strong as a tiger, was in the baking room, where the temperature was always above 120 degrees, breathing the suffocating smell of tobacco and hemp wine from day to night. So, he became thinner and weaker day by day, until he collapsed today. However, before long, news came from the hospital that he had indeed died of scarlet fever. Died. This terrible impression was deeply imprinted in my brain. I didn't even have the courage to walk past the door of the baking room with a temperature of over 120 degrees. However, the workers didn't make a sound, silently responding to the fact that this colleague had died for work.</p>
<p>"We should send some money to the worker's family as usual."</p>
<p>The manager mechanically asked for everyone's opinion, but many people didn't respond, remaining silent.</p>
<p>"Just send him five dollars!" A big shot who earned two hundred dollars a month for doing nothing said unwillingly.</p>
<p>Five dollars. Suppressing my grief, I recorded the number in the daily accounts. However, on the other hand, I was recording the following many numbers:</p>
<p>"××× banquet for official business, fifty dollars."</p>
<p>"××× fifty dollars, ××× car fare six dollars. ××× treat twenty-eight dollars and ninety cents!"</p>
<p>"×× Company demands overdue payment plus interest, totaling three thousand five hundred dollars."</p>
<p>"×× Bank demands interest on the mortgaged factory, twelve thousand dollars."</p>
<p>I sighed, but my head became dizzy and hot.</p>

<h3 id="e203">Suzhou People (15) <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Wenzong</p>
<p>Jinghong: Proving this matter, the contrast in economic power and advertising publicity is not enough, because advertising is fundamentally a means of enticing purchases. This is a necessary path for doing business and attracting customers. All those who lack economic strength will envy the colorful and beautiful sweet words on advertisements. Those beautiful and pleasant advertising terms are specifically used to swindle the money of those who have no permanent property and seek cheap things. The weaker the economic power, the more people want to enjoy various inexpensive and high-quality materials. So I say, advertising is the ultimate weapon for enticing those with weak purchasing power, and the small citizens who don't have much money and plan to get bargains are often controlled by advertising.</p>
<p>Liya: But isn't the greatest effect of advertising and its original intention probably more than just the base flattery you mentioned?</p>
<p>Jinghong: That's natural. What I said is limited to dishonest advertising. But those honest advertisements have long been forced to be powerless by those boring advertisements, deceptive advertisements, bragging advertisements, and advertisements with low-level seductive tactics! Therefore, dishonest advertising can instead deceive and control the ignorant masses.</p>
<p>Liya: Then the British haute cuisine I just ate must be advertising-based cuisine?</p>
<p>Jinghong: As long as that "British" cuisine has the effect of distinguishing flavors in your mouth, making the advertisement for that haute cuisine lose its power of deception, then you are not one of the people who have been fooled. According to what you said just now, it was so delicious, that is because the advertising's boasting has overcome the "purchaser's ability to distinguish." The purchaser has lost the "identification of matter" and the "discrimination of taste," then even the worst things become the best things.</p>

<p>He Yunfang, He Qinfang - Double Pearl Ball</p>
<p>Zhongxi (1040) 1:00 PM to 1:45 PM</p>
<p>Opening: "He Xiangu"</p>
<p>He Taiweng of Zengcheng, Guangzhou, was seventy years old and had no children, feeling disheartened. All year round, he worshipped Buddha and prayed to the gods, eating vegetarian food, burning incense, and praying to the heavens. In the spring, he offered incense everywhere, repairing temples, gilding statues, and donating generously. It has been five years now, reciting scriptures and kneeling in prayer without ceasing. His wife suddenly had a dream last night, dreaming of a five-colored phoenix entering her womb. After having the dream, within a few days, she felt a swelling in her belly that grew daily. He Taiweng knew and was overjoyed, loving the child dearly regardless of whether it was a boy or a girl. However, conceiving after a dream is quite peculiar, surely a divine gift in answer to his prayers. Time flies like water, and the months pass quickly. In an instant, ten months have passed. On the day of labor, the room was fragrant like musk, and at the time of birth, a strange red light filled the sky. The delivery was painless, and soon a baby descended from the heavens. The maid saw that it was a beautiful girl, with six strands of hair on her head, different from others. She rushed to tell He Taiweng the news, saying that the wife had safely given birth without pain, to a precious daughter. He Taiweng immediately looked at her lovely face. He Taiweng was delighted by her beautiful appearance, and his heart was filled with joy. Eighteen springs passed quickly. Xiangu was unwilling to marry a fine husband. Suddenly, in a night dream, a divine person taught her to eat mica powder. She could then lightly enter the celestial palace. From then on, she went to the mountains and valleys, walking swiftly like the wind. Later, Wu Dun learned of her and summoned her. While traveling through Guanzhong, she suddenly disappeared. Later, she ascended to heaven in broad daylight and entered the Ziwei Palace.</p>

<h3 id="e209">MGM Produced "Romeo and Juliet" <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>A year ago, Warner Bros.' "A Midsummer Night's Dream" was completed. Originally, other Hollywood companies were secretly preparing to produce a large number of Shakespearean plays, but due to Warner's failure, they all abandoned their plans.</p>
<p>MGM, which has always been known for its bold investments, was not daunted by this. They were still unwilling to abandon this new path that could be opened up. So they decided to produce a film of "Romeo and Juliet."</p>
<p>According to estimates, the cost of this film will reach US$1.25 million.</p>
<p>The producer paid special attention to the dialogue in Shakespeare's original work. In order to be precise and accurate, they searched through eighteen different versions. Finally, it was decided to use the Cambridge edition of the original book.</p>
<p>Also, in order to accurately understand the situation of the city of Verona in the 1400s, the film's art director, Mr. Gibbons, sent two photographers to this ancient Italian city to observe. They spent three months there, taking 3,769 related photos, from which they made dozens of scale models, and then built magnificent studio sets based on the models.</p>
<p>A set of Verona's central square alone covered eight acres. Another large ballroom was 250 feet wide across the ends and 400 feet long. Capulet's garden was also the same size, but it looked even wider than the ballroom. The balcony, which Romeo had to climb up with its roots covered in roses (one of the most intoxicating scenes in the original), was 24 feet high.</p>
<p>The biggest expense of this film was still on the actors' costumes. The film had more than 1,200 male and female actors, and the female costumes were much more troublesome than the male ones; they used 20,000 yards of silk, while the males used 18,000 yards. Romeo's jacket alone used nine yards, but Leslie Howard wore it four times, so it was worth it in the end.</p>
<p>"Romeo and Juliet," starring Norma Shearer as Juliet, will be released soon in this city. It is the second Shakespearean film adaptation in the last two years. In total, Hollywood has paid nearly three million gold yuan for Shakespeare on these two films.</p>
