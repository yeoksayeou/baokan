<h3>有田大使來華</h3>
<p>— 高</p>
<p>新任日大使有田八郞氏已自神戶啟程來華預計今日可抵上海有田此來携有廣田外相之新訓令準備與我國當局作具體之交涉張弛不定之中日關係至是或得有解抉之機會吾人以國民之立塲攄滿腔之熱誠竊有不能已於言者敢於有田大使到任之始一吐吾人之胸臆</p>
<p>中日提携之聲浪久經喧騰而不息然而冀東之畸形組織迄未取消華北之黯澹風雲依然籠罩謀士之幕後策動益增活躍漢奸之乘問搆煽迭據報告如此而欲啟親善之途徑其何能示吾人以貞信日方誠能確切「感悟東亞之大局由互相信賴之精神以百年大計爲基礎」如有田大使臨行時所云云者則首先應由日方改變已往之政策停止壓迫之行動以衷誠諒解之精神謀平等互惠之合作我以渴愛和平之故未嘗不願抑制創傷之餘痛期待新局之開展若祗以手揮五絃目送飛鴻爲盡外交之能事要非吾人所樂聞也</p>
<p>抑又有言者有田大使到任而後對於吾國之民族心理極應有明確之認識而於其本國軍人所造成之旣往事實亦寧能無切實之反省根據有田大使在大阪商工會議所歡迎會席上之談片似於吾國所持態度猶有未盡瞭解之處此項成見之執著良足滋吾人之惶慮正如多田氏在平所發表之談話以爲「兩國當局均應負起責任不能祗責人不責己」一經吾人分析之下實有啼笑兩非之感蓋如多田所處之地位能知自責誠爲和平前途之福若令吾人亦興自責之念以吾人之不敏實百思無可承之過必欲勉强覓得一語則「匹夫無罪懐璧其罪」亦惟以此自承而已最後吾人敢節述有吉大使離任感想中數語以奉吿於有田大使曰「觀最近日本之思潮似有日本所爲均是而違反日本主張之外國議論均非之傾向此事相當程度之內似須謹愼誠然輕己非所以得他人之尊敬然昂然謂日本人以外之所爲均惡此言或須反省也」甚願有田大使三復斯言能以反省爲基點覓取交涉之途徑則於解决中日間之糾紛思過半矣</p>
<h3>冀北分區防共</h3>

<h3>四國海軍恊定有本星期內簽字說　英不堅持徵求德同意主張　法放棄海空軍備關聯問題</h3>
<p>倫敦　海軍界人士以爲海軍質的限制協定、可在本星期之內正式簽字、綠英國原擬在四國海軍協定簽字之前、先行徵求德國同意、頃已放棄此議、協定草案、幷未包括政治問題、或海空兩軍軍備互相關聯問題在內、（廿五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　海軍會議英國代表團、自上星期與關係各國代表團允其是美國代表團、分別舉行談話之後、頃已了然於海軍質的限制技術協定、不宜摻雜政治問題在內、吾則最後失敗、在所難免、綠意國代表團對於該國在制裁期內未能參加政治協定一層、業已有所表示、法國代表團、則要求在邀請德國參加海軍恊定之前、先行解决空軍軍備限制問題、美國代表團復限於本國政府訓令、對於任何議定書或任何協定、載有政治條欵者、均無權予以簽字、英國鑒於各該國態度、互相鑿柄如是、遂乃變更態度、而以成立技術協定爲已足、此外、英國政府曾於昨日晚間、經由外交途徑、與德國政府有所接洽、俾克根據去年五月問英德海軍協定能以獲得德國造艦程序之情報、俾使邀請德國參加海軍協定之舉、無其必要云、（二十五日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　海會意總代表皮西亞與英海相孟塞爾今日會談甚久、皮氏曾將羅馬最近之訓令吿知孟氏、其會談時間自下午三時三十分起、至六時三十分止、二人散會後均守緘默、但並不吾認皮氏曾提出制裁問題、一般人士推料、意國必重行聲明意政府之簽字海軍條的、以政治爭案滿意解决爲條件、美總代表台維斯旋訪問孟塞爾海會情勢今日仍未見有何進步、孟塞爾明日將再會晤皮西亞、法國現亦堅主在何海軍條的涉及政治事件、而台維斯則竭力反對此種行動、故海會今顯然處於甚困難之地位也、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　意國今日通知英國、謂意相墨索里尼在國聯未撤消制裁計畫及英國海軍增加艦隊未退出地中海以前、無意簽字於海軍協定云、此舉不啻使倫敦海軍會議受一打擊、美國首席代表台維斯與英海軍大臣孟珊爾會談兩小時、當就最近之發展有所商討、台氏今日對於法國代表所稱、法國現正期待華盛頓答覆巴黎所提限制戰鬥艦噸位及大砲口徑建議一說、表示詫異、謂已將美國對於此項限制不欲表示贊同之意、通知法國代表矣、（二十四日國民電）</p>
<h3>飛機上炸彈發明家　發明超無畏艦　美海部正考慮其計畫</h3>
<p>美國史丹福　飛機上所用炸彈之發明家巴樂氏、今日聲稱、彼現已發明一種超無畏艦、無論魚雷之襲擊、重砲之轟擊、以及空中之爆炸、皆不能中傷之、此種戰艦、外有保護甲一、但爲非金屬材料所製成、艦傍裝有魚雷發射管二個、每分鐘能發射魚雷二决、噸數每艦至少有八萬五千噸、速率每小時十五海哩、據巴氏言、美海部現正考慮其計劃、同時蘇俄英國亦欲購買其計劃云、（廿四日國民電）</p>
<h3>英外相向下院演說國際情形　充實軍務擁護集體制　反對黨主張卽行禁油</h3>
<p>倫敦　艾登就英外相職後、昨晚第一决在下院發表關於國際情形之重要言論、其言可分三段、第一段言意阿問題、第二段陳述其對於意阿爭議未有直接關係的若干事件之意見、第三段泛論一般國際情勢、說明英國不得不增加軍備經費之原因、英外相此番言論、係於下院辯論外交事件時發表者、</p>
<p>反對黨領袖史密士首開辯論、責備政府對於制裁事件優柔寡斷、主張政府宜努力使油禁立卽實現、並停止以畜牲棉花等物繼續供給侵略國、自由黨辛克來贊成上述主張、謂美國縱不參加油禁、亦必須實施、而煤鐵銅等亦應禁運、務期完全斷絕對意之經濟關係云、保守黨愛梅立獨持異論、勸政府勿盲從制裁、宜就事之利害、而勿就懲戒意國之觀念、謀取解决辦法、</p>
<h3>對意制裁成績</h3>
<p>外相艾登於鼓掌聲中起立致詞、追述前事、謂在戰事發生後之十日中、意國被國聯行政院諸國宣判為侵略國、而此判詞後復為大會中五十委員國所承認通過、於是設立委員會、提議對意實行之辦法四條、其成續之可注意者、爲進行之迅速、而非迂緩、調整委員會與小組會所擔任者、爲籌議制裁之艱難工作、金融事件之制裁、與意國出口貨之拒絕、當然莫能卽求共實施有效、此乃顯然可見者、其目的在逐漸以他國之購買力、代替意國之購買力、</p>
<p>意國財源漸竭</p>
<p>査平時意國對國聯會員國之輸出、佔其總輸出額百分之七十、今侵略國在外之購買力、自因制裁結果而大縮减、處於此種地位之國家、當然能就其所有金準備與國外匯兌之所許、繼續在國外採辦、惟在此種事態中、該國資金自必迅速减少、終必有完全喪失其購買力之一日、試觀意國近來之努力、可見意國今已深覺制裁之重要矣、戰事的影響、係連接的與累積的、終必有重要力量以達到國聯之主要目的、主要目的爲何、則停戰是也、</p>
<p>禁油問題研究</p>
<p>國聯現所考慮者、爲物品的制裁、而此物品接濟之源、大都操方非國聯會員國之手、在渠觀之、油之制裁、與他物之制裁相同、亦必須以同樣標準判定之、卽其實施可吾襄助制止戰爭是、因制止戰爭、乃出席日內瓦會議的各國所共有之目的也、故各國政府必須以此種精神研究之、而後决定之、至于如何决定、渠不能有所陳說、因國聯會員國政府刻正愼重研究專家報吿書、今尙未完畢也、</p>
<p>英仍共同行動</p>
<p>英政府已行其所能行者、以便利此委員會之集會、該委員會能决定愈早、則與事愈爲有益、同時英政府在原則上並未拋棄其關於油禁之原有决議、亦未取消其與國聯其他會員國對於議决事伴採行集體行動之决心、英政府之政策、仍爲對於侵略、維持穩健而共同的抵抗、英政府之任何决議、當以國聯盟的本身之精神爲依歸、非至和的簽定時、不容有示弱或退讓舉動、</p>
<p>國聯威信大增</p>
<p>吾人不可因國聯非萬能者而遽挫弱吾人對於國聯之擁護、國聯雖不能成就任何事件、但未嘗不能成就許多事件、在過去十八個月內、國聯威信大增、而權力亦隨威信以俱來、今固有人視國聯爲危險物、但凡稍知外交事伴者、則今日未有視國聯爲無足道者、國聯有兩種性質、一爲如警察之消極任務、一爲如調解者與和事老之建設工作、二者决不相同、一般人亟所期望者、在獲見意阿爭議之美滿解决耳、</p>
<p>和議並未放棄</p>
<p>英外相發言至此、乃進叙去年九月國聯行政院所指派五國委員會研究可使各方面滿意的解决基礎之報吿書、謂不幸該報告書之條欵、當時未爲意政府所接受、但自英政府觀之、此報吿書仍可爲今後調解之根據、渠覺在國聯進行制裁時、國聯究抱有何種目的、此誠不可不說明之、制裁辦法雖爲吾人全體所不歡迎、然爲達其目的之工具、其目的在依照國聯原則成立解决、而使雙方有耐久的尋常關係耳、渠希望五國委員會之報吿書、不爲人所忘却、亦不爲人所擱置、據英政府之意見、重開和平談判之適當地點、厥爲日內瓦、因該處空氣最相宜也、</p>
<p>他日渠往日內瓦重行討論制裁事件時、渠當以下院之完全同意發明白切實之言論、聲明英國朝野固願積極會同他國實施制裁、但允願首先獲見意阿間在公平基礎上恢復和平、</p>
<p>盟約無須修正</p>
<p>外相决述及國聯盟的修正之建議、謂今非修正盟的適宜之時、决乃涉及原料問題、謂政府甚願隨時研究霍爾爵士前所言及之殖民地原料問題、惟此終非消除百病之秘訣、此問題至爲複雜、</p>
<p>集體制二條件</p>
<p>外相次泛論國際現局、謂在大戰十八年後、各國復遭遇强之可怖之問題、與一九一四年前所遭遇者脗然相同、實使世界集合運用之智力、失其功效、今日政治家最急切之工作、厥爲覔取遏止戰爭再見之有功效的智力、英國若欲參加集體安全、則有二條件爲必不可少者、</p>
<p>安全制度應眞正集體而有權力、足職任何侵略者之野心、</p>
<p>英國在此制度中盡其充分職責之政策與武力、應十足有力與堅决、</p>
<p>外相繼謂、吾人於重行聲明、贊助國聯與集體全制、要當明白分別此種政策與包圍政策、英政府所欲者、爲在集體安全制中克盡厥責、而不欲參加包圍行動、軍備經費、今不得不大增、此層實可扼腕、但此計畫中實寓有安慰、蓋重整軍備、以固集體安全制、實重整軍備方式之最廉價者也、</p>
<p>充實軍備原因</p>
<p>外相末謂、今因各國之好意殊乏信任、而恐怖復四面來襲、吾人實不得不重整軍備、逐漸增固集體安全制、實爲消除無端侵略的恐怖之唯一途徑、必俟各國皆知無論如何、侵略行爲得不償失而後已云、工黨領袖艾特里對外相演說表示大失望、謂政府對於國聯事伴、舉棋不定、不能使全國有一致之趨向、英國增加軍備之案件、勢將提出、而所需之軍備、僅因國聯而置、工黨不願贊成軍備之增加、與帝國主義及聯盟的政策、</p>
<p>意國貿易銳減</p>
<p>外决克蘭邦結束辯論、謂制裁現漸發生效果、意國出口貿易已大受打擊、英國在地中海之舉動、純屬防禦性質、英國既擔任集合安全、英國言行相符、實爲和局所可依賴之最大保障、繼謂全世界現皆感受不寗、獨英國爲中流砥柱、吾人應使此砥柱堅固安穩、英國重行考慮之軍備、其理由在此云、（二十五日路透電）</p>
<h3>艾登演說　反對各黨失望　則其不落邊際</h3>
<p>倫敦　英外相艾登、昨夜在下院之演說、使工黨與自由黨報紙、皆爲之失望、責其言論不落邊際、保守黨亦以爲艾登之言、無新頴處、惟贊成其英國遵守集體安全制度之切實聲明、及其應付制裁問題之常識、泰晤士報稱、艾登之言、得內閣全體之同意、其主旨、無非爲英國必須重置軍備、方可促成軍縮耳、油禁一事、如乞助於美國、則將招美國多數人民之忿恨、而視爲國聯欲以其不願有的責任、加諸美國之舉動云、每日郵報與每日捷報、仍抱反對集體安全制度之態度、惟晨郵報、則謂艾登之言、未有英政府欲首先發動以新制裁施諸意國之表示、此層差堪欣慰云、（二十五日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　下議院昨日討論政府現行外交政策時、外相艾登曾發表長篇演說、國會人士頃加以評論、以爲其中最可注意之點、乃係關於意阿爭端所作之主張、卽堅主賡續舉行談判、從事調解、以覓求滿意解决方法者也、至一般人所得印象、則以爲下議院各議員、對於歐洲現行局勢所抱不安之念、仍無以去之、而政府所處地位、亦未見其增强云、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>國聯人士欣慰　集體保安制繫於英國態度</h3>
<p>日內瓦　英國外相艾登、昨在該國下議院發表演說之後、國聯會人士、均加以評論、以爲艾登對於國聯會盟的修正之議、業已表示反對、因而某某國關於修正盟的之主張、自須展緩加以討論、幷以爲艾登外相演詞、關於意阿爭端一段、不甚明切、推原其故、端由國聯會大會十八國小組委員會卽將開會、自宜審愼將事所致、至以全篇演詞而論、則對於集體安全制度、仍表示贊同、此層殊堪欣慰、要之、歐洲各國根據國聯會盟的各項原則、所可完成之集體安全組織、能吾有成、其主要因素、端以英國對於國聯會之態度爲轉移、此外英國在十八國小組委員會開會時、所當採取之態度、亦可對艾登外相在演詞中所提及之原則見其端倪云、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>日內瓦　國聯各會員讀畢英外相艾登在衆院中之演辭後、皆以爲英國對於德國重振軍備之關切、遠過於對於意阿爭端之關切、蓋前此霍爾與賴伐爾之計劃、其注意點亦在於是、卽欲轉移意大利之意嚮、重建斯特拉薩之對德陣錢、而艾登今决之演說、可謂舊事重提、此層雖頗使此間之國聯代表駭怪、但艾登仍側重於集體和平之一點、已能除此間人士英國行將打擊國聯對意政策之疑慮、（二十四日國民電）</p>
<h3>巴黎印象深刻　認為與法國政策並不抵觸</h3>
<p>巴黎　英外相艾登在下院演說、堅决聲明英國對意制裁政策將賡續不變、已引起巴黎各界深刻之印象、衆意英政府所取之政策、與法政府所取之態度毫不抵觸、法政府之態度、爲凡國聯行政院所通過之任何集體行動、法國必予以充分贊助、但法國决不於此事有所倡議、艾登所稱、英國爲集體安全計、現需重整軍備之言、亦爲法國各方面誠摯歡迎、（二十五日路透社電）</p>

<h3>英下院通過追加軍費　海軍部提出造艦計畫</h3>
<p>倫敦　下議院本日舉行非公開會議、討論國防問題、海軍部當提出海軍造艦計畫云、內閣因法·意·日·美四國、相率添造驅逐艦、頃已决定添造此項軍艦九艘、各爲一千三百五十噸、此在下議院、頗有主張另造一千八百五十噸驅逐七艦者、此外下議院旋將內閣前於本月十七日所提出之海陸空三部追加預算案、分別表决、計海軍追加經費四·三五〇·〇〇〇鎊、係以二八六票對九五票通過、陸軍追加經費、一·三五〇·〇〇〇鎊、係以二六八票對八六票通過、空軍追加經費、一·六一一·〇〇〇鎊、係以二六八票對八二票通過、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>伯敏罕　英前外相奧史汀張伯倫、今日於此演說、大意謂美國之擴張軍備、絕不足怪、英國亦决不致於與美國戰爭、但備戰之殷切、既遍及歐洲、卽瑞士與菏蘭、亦皆捲入漩渦、各方之猜嫌顧忌、又若是其甚、則英國自不應單獨落五也、（廿四日國民電）</p>
<h3>法俄互援公約　法國會尙討論　外長宣言向內閣說明</h3>

<h3>意阿兩國和議　有人提出新計劃　以國聯盟約與條約為根據　關係各國當局正從事研究</h3>
<p>倫敦　關於意阿兩國議和問題、最近有人提出一種新計畫、正由關係各國從事研究、一般人以爲意國對於此項計畫、極願加以考慮、該國首相墨索里尼且已遣派人員、以私人資格前往阿國、與該國皇帝開始接洽、俾雙方談判若果歸於失敗、意國方面仍可加以吾認、按此項新計畫主要原則、乃將一九〇六年英法意三國對阿條的、與國聯會盟的所規定之義務、予以融和、庶有以滿足各方願望、其槪要有如下述、</p>

<h3>國聯十八國委員會下月二日召集　討論對意加緊制裁　法意外交接洽頻繁</h3>
<p>羅馬　國聯大會十八國小組委員會、定於下月二日開會、討論對意加緊制裁問題、外傳意國政府將於是日下令全國軍艦升火準備、待令出動、此訊頃經官方吾認、（二十四日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>巴黎　外交部長佛蘭亭、頃與意國大使賽呂蒂相會晤、一般人以爲此舉必與禁運煤油問題有關、幷以爲國聯大曾十八國小組委員會下月二日討論此項問題時、法國政府必當採取消極態度、卽該委員會所可决定之辦法、法國政府不願加以規避、但各項行動、凡足使國際時局愈益趨於緊張者、亦不願有所發動、此在半官方面、幷云法國既非煤油生產國、又非大運銷國、其對於此項問題所可發生之影響、自屬有限云、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>南京消防事業之槪觀　消防隊與救火會相輔而行自動電話不利於傳遞警報全市消防機關有十九單位</h3>
<p>南京通訊、南京自從奠都以後、人口日增、當民十六年時、全市僅有三十六萬餘人、最近據警廳統、已達百萬以上、幾乎增多三倍、關於京市消防實力、是否與人口的增多、成一種正比例、殊成問題茲調查其梗槪略紀如次、</p>
<p>大凡消防組織、可分常備消防和義勇消防兩類、所謂常備消防、乃是有給的、而義勇消防、則是無給的、換句話說、常備消防、是一種固定的組織、且是獲得一定的報酬的、義男消防、是在事變發生之後、方才臨時集合、事後仍回原職、不受任何報酬的、南京的消防組織、截至現在止、共有十九單位、計消防隊六處、救火會十三處、至其分配、消防隊計東·南·北·中·下關·浦口·各一處、救火會計東區三處·南區一處、西區三處、北區二處、中區三處、下關一處、</p>
<p>關於京市消防組織之實際情形、承消防警察隊隊長王濟。及東區第一救火會許漢泉南君、面吿其詳、茲先述南京之常備消防、據王君談、消防隊係屬於首都響察應管轄、故其經費來源、僅爲警察行政費之一部份、到現在止、還沒有特定的經費、所以關於消防組織的盛衰、常視歷屆應長是吾重視此種事業爲標準、王（固磐）廳長到任不久、還沒有什麽變動、當陳（焯）廳長任職時期、曾經竭力整頓、當時共有悄防警士十八隊、隨後裁汰六隊、卽以節餘之欵、添置消防設備、新式消防汽車、便已增爲六輛、這時經費並未增加、但是消防實力、却已增厚不少了、</p>
<p>又云、自從改用自動電話以後、在一般社會、當然感覺便利、可是就消防的立塲而言、却是一種絕大的損失、當過去探用磁石或共電式電話的時期、遇有火警情報發生、無論何種緊要的通話、都得暫時停止、而儘先傳遞、現在利用機器通話、反而失去了伸縮的作用、而致於延誤了、因爲牠是以五十個爲單位的、在這五十個中間、同時只能接通十個、當我們使用電話的時侯、時常會聽到忙聲、「郎嗡嗡的聲音）其原因便是尙未獲得通話的機會、試想當火警發生的時候、如何能遭受此種意外的躭誤呢、關於補救的方法、曾經向電話局商洽結果、只有裝設專線之一法、然而代價過鉅、事實上又不可能、現在僅在隊部內另外裝設了一架電話、專爲外間對內通話之用、這樣、不過减低了一個通話的機會、收效也很有限云云、</p>
<p>南京的瞭望台、共有兩處、城南爲中華門城樓、城北爲鼓樓城樓、此外各地警察派出所、也負有傳報的責任、消防總隊獲得上項情報以後、一方立卽出動、一方並傳達消息於各消防隊及救火會、至於民間通報、經過反問的方式、隨時也可以重的、</p>
<p>東區第一救火會、乃是商辦性質、不消說是義勇消防了、該會的經費、係由商家捐助、救火員却是付予薪給的、同時也是終日留守會中、以便隨時出動、這樣、實質上已是常備消防了、據許君言、該會已經有一百餘年的歷史、當遜淸時、爲永平水龍局、民十八年、改用帮浦機、稱永平救火會、民二十年四月、劃爲東區、至民二十一年、又積資添購消防汽車、這是南京自有新式救火車輛的開始、到現在止、救火會方面、先後添置九輛、加上消防隊六　、　市已共有十五輛之多、此外尙有瓦斯唧筒、（帮浦機）計分拖帶式。固定式。搭儎式。三種、除了全市十九個消防組織各有一架外、北路消防隊、則有兩架、一共是二十架、京市消防器械的槪數、大致如是、</p>
<p>當民十八年春間、城南張府園、於白畫失火、其後延燒至內橋、火勢猛撲過河、夾岸對燒、又蔓延至昇平橋一帶、一直到舊上元縣署現貧兒敎養院址爲止、共計焚燬住戶商店二百數十家、從午飯時起火、至傍晚即是撲滅、經過這一次大火、南京市民、對於為警、幾乎談虎色變、頗懷戒心、允其是商人、關係更切據許君云、那時消防隊實力有限、該會尙係沿用舊式帮浦、其他各救火會、更是不消說了、加以彼時市政幼稚、街道狹窄、每遇火警發生、常致釀成鉅災、商人方面、受了這决敎訓、大家不的而同的、踴躍捐欵、購置新式消防器械、東區第一救火會、便在如此情形之下、採辦新式瓦斯唧筒了、自此以後、經過數年的經營、京市消防的實力、方才達到今日的境地云云、</p>
<h3>松江　省保安隊改進訉</h3>

<h3>上海之桕蠟業　（上海工商業槪況之十五）</h3>
<p>— 中國徵信社主編</p>
<p>一，沿革　桕蠟者。柏油，白蠟，洋蠟之總稱也。上海之有柏蠟業。由來已久。蓋我國數千年來。民間崇尙迷信。柏蠟製造之蠟燭。消費浩繁。遜淸光緒三十四年。上海鼎豐皂廠嚴仲山君。亭利皂廠陳杭帆君。發明拍油製皂用途。遂咸爲工業原料。惟當時尙無大規模之皂廠。採用拍油者甚尠。故民國紀元以前。柏油業尙藉迷信爲護符。全恃淘銷爲挹注。逮民國十年。固本皂廠。民十五年。中國肥皂公司。（英商祥茂肥皂廠）開始採用拍油以來。銷路供不數求。同業逐漸增多。民二十年。市面發現空前高價。影響所及。引起外貨椰子油日貨硬化油（亦稱魚油）之傾銷。至是柏油皂銷。侵奪殆盡。近年柏價復低。而舶來品價反趨高。柏銷漸復舊觀。據民國二十四年度調査。全國柏油產量。共爲七十五萬擔。除洶銷應用外。皂銷亦達二十萬擔。而上海之柏油用量。獨占九萬二千擔。是以本市。在拍油市場上。亦列重要地位。依目前柏價而論。外貨難以輸入。柏銷前送。方興未艾也。</p>
<p>柏油，白蠟。同爲我國特產。在昔洋莊去路。尙稱不弱。顧以用途不繁。降至今日。幾等於零。允以白蠟產銷衰落爲甚。洋蠟輸入。距今不過三十年。進口數量。與年俱增。民二十三年四月。俄蠟初决到滬。市場形勢。遂起變化。市面亦趨不振矣。</p>
<p>二，桕蠟之種類及產地</p>

<p>白蠟爲蠟蟲樓於蠟樹上所分泌之物。蠟蟲與蠟榭所產之地不同。蠟蟲產於四川之犍爲，雅安，及川滇交界之會理等處。綿延數百里。飼養蠟蟲爲生者。不下數萬人。蠟樹產於四川嘉定。每當小滿時節。土人將蠟蟲移於蠟樹。蠶食蠟葉。日久其排洩物。凝積成塊。提煉蒸化。即成白蠟。據民國二十四年度調査。嘉定府屬產額爲七千擔。叙州府屬爲六千四百擔。雲南東川爲二千四百擔。共達一萬五千八百擔。以川省出產最多。貨品可分米心統占兩種。米心色白質堅。統占色亮質鬆。以支爲單位。每支八餅。每餅大者。重市秤三十八斤。小者重市秤十九斤。統占之天增公牌。米心之慶申永牌。允稱最佳。</p>
<p>洋蠟又名石蠟。爲煤油中之副產品。俗稱火油精。有全煉半練之分。又有一一〇，一一五，一二〇，一二五，一三〇，一三五，一四〇度份之別。度份愈高。品質愈佳。。三五度以上。可供化妝品原料。通常燭廠採用者爲一二五度貨。至低次度份。以火柴廠需用最繁。自海外輸入。或用木桶。或用蔴包。桶裝容量。自三百五十斤至四百斤。蔴包容量。自一百至一百七十斤不等。美孚亞細亞出售者爲全煉貨。美國貨以半煉貨居多。俄貨全屬半煉也。（未完）</p>

<h3>鄂省近兩年敎育概況</h3>
<p>湖北省敎育、過去因受天災人禍之影響、極爲衰落、自二十二年七月、程穉秋廳長到任後、力謀整理、經兩載之慘澹經營、已上軌道、茲將該省最近兩年來之各級敎育概况、摘要綠下、</p>
<p>敎育經費　該省敎育經費、自二十年七月接收漢口市全部學校起、連同省立各校館、每月經費達三十三萬餘元、二十一年二月、因財政困難、折减爲二十九萬餘元、至二十一年十月、仍以省庫不敷、裁併校館、再度折减、幷將漢口市學校、劃歸漢口市府辦理、每月共支十九萬餘元、至十一月份三度折减、每月支十六萬餘元、二十二三年度、爲應事實上需要、概算數目定十七萬餘元、如包括漢口市敎育經費在內、全省敎育文化費、除縣區敎育經費外、年度概算數爲二百六十五萬零五百六十九元如除去漢口市敎費、該省二十三年度度敎育文化歲出經費二三二九六三四元（其分配敎育行政一三四四一八元、義務敎育三二〇四二四元、高等敎育二一〇四八五元、中等敎育九二七六〇八元、小學四四六四〇〇元社敎及文化事業一〇五五〇二元補助及津貼六四四四八元、擴充敎育一二〇〇〇〇元、鄂西敎育專員辦事處九三四八元）較前均有增加、（二十一年度共二一三五一七二元二十二年度二一八六二八六元）查鄂省財政、因連年匪共猖獗、影響稅收、至二十年上季、雖不能充裕、然按照預算開支、尚可按月發淸，自是年秋季浜水爲災庫收益短、每月經費既不能如期發放、幸　十一年十一月份起、經過裁併三項辦法以後、收支適合、逐月經費已能按上下兩半月兩次發淸而過去積欠省立各校館經費與留學經費、歷數數任皆未能淸償共有百萬元之鉅、竟能於一年內陸續發淸、二十三年度內、該省敎育事業得以推行盡利、未始非籌發積欠之一助亦可見敎育行政當局之擘畫、煞費苦心矣、</p>
<p>高等敎育　考我國選派國外公費留學生始自清同治十一年、該省公費留學、則自清光緒二十五年張之洞主持鄂政時、始行派遣、至光緒三十年、竟達四百餘人之多、民國成立、李明黃陂督鄂、以革命功勛爲派遣之標凖、所有辛有功英俊多派遣出國、迨後在日本、留學考入帝大·商工·高師·一高至八高·明治五種特的學校爲選給公費之標準、至民國六年起改用考試、先由省署初試、再送敎部復試决定、民十七至二十二年考派與選補兩種並行、考試係在國內舉行、十七年十九年二十年各舉行一决、全由敎廳主持、無須送部復試、選補係就已在國外留學之自費生中行之、自十七年以至二十二年上學期、遇有缺額、卽行選補、故彼時留學公費生多屬選補、迨民國二十二年四月敎部公布國外留學規程、該廳亦照改訂留學規程呈准施行、該廳對於整理留學經費、除籌欵發淸從前積欠使國外公費生得以安心求學、以便考核外、查二十二年度留學經費預算月支一萬六千七百九十元四角査照二十一年度十一月份以後九折數編列、按月由財廳撥交敎廳匯發各生、二十三年度亦照二十二年度編列、全年總數爲二〇一四八五四元分列爲公費生及自費生獎學金二節前者年支一七三六二一元後者、年支二七八六四兀、此外尙有留學臨時費係指公費生之出國回國川資及醫藥撫卹救濟各費、二十三年度年列一千零三十元該廳爲謀留學生生活安定並策勵進修起見、一面於初决出國生一决、先發給三個月學費、第四個月起仍按月提前匯發、一面對於學業成續嚴格考查、以期不致虛糜公帑、至該省最近調査統計國外公費生留日者八名留德者十省、留比者三名留英者四名、留美者四名留法者一名、其選拔國外自費留學獎學金學生事項、自二十三年度起已由敎廳分聘王星拱·陳時·黃溥·姜琦·宋雪亭·何淸銘·高啟　等爲審査委員、先後審査合格起費者有王震寰十名每月獎金有德幣一百馬克或美金三十元法幣五百三十佛郞者不等、</p>

<p>初等敎育　該省初等敎育、前經敎部督學鍾道贊科長吳研因視察認爲良好、學生成績以國語勞作二科爲最佳、二十二三兩年度辦理初敎較爲重事項、爲指定省立武穴小學等校爲鄂東鄂西鄂北中心小學、舉行小學敎員暑期講習會、令各小學注重勞作科養成兒童操作習慣及生產技能、减輕各小學學生負担省校免收學費私校亦加限制、並設三分之一以上免費學額、以救濟貧兒）、劃分省立武昌實騐區初級小學輔導區設置輔導主任並指定五校試辦二部制、成立全省初敎研究會並討論初敎問題、添加省立各小學及師範附小班决、並增設幼稚園及省立義務敎育實騐區、短期小學及簡易小學、</p>
<p>地方敎育　鄂省敎育過去不免重視省會、忽略地方、其程度相差甚遠、經程廳長兩年之銳意整頓推廣、其較大事項如下、一舉行全省縣區敎育行政會議以妥籌改進地方敎育之方、二實施湖北復輿地方敎育三年計畫、以挽救地方敎育之衰落、三實施復興鄂西地方敎育辦法以期鄂西敎育與全鄂各縣平均發展、四審查及檢定小學敎師、淘汰席劣重用師範畢業生、以謀地方學校內容之改善、五登記縣督學以愼選地方敎育視察指導人員、六制定湖北各縣塾師檢定委會章程暨塾師暑期訓練班規則、以檢定及訓練塾師改良私塾、七制定湖北捐資與學褒獎章程以獎勵私人及私人團體興學、八制定湖北各縣敎育行政人員老成章程策勵敎育行政人員、以促地方敎育之推進、九將未裁之敎育局、一律併入縣府第三科及敎育附捐暫准照案微收、以節省行政經費擴充地方敎育事業及維持地方現有敎育事項不使中斷、十制定湖北實行政敎合一及普及敎育辦法大綱暨各縣聯保設立小學辦法、以謀地方敎育之積極發展與政敎之協同進行、以上諸項除第十項於二十四年六月方開始施行外、其餘各項、均有相當成效僅就初等敎育而論、據最近調査所得、該省各縣小學及初小總計的四千三百所、由二十二三兩年度增設者計達一千二百所、增加數量約佔總數三分之一、足徵地方敎育經兩年之經營已有日趨復興之象、可見該省敎育行政當局之努力也、</p>

<p>外匯結果英平美鬆</p>
<p>滙市昨以華商仍無活動、缺乏精彩、結果英平美鬆、晨初以外電倫敦大條近期勿動、遠期長〇六二五、脚地講收市後照掛牌有賣戶之說、紐的銀市勿動、蒙得里遠期銀價長一釐至四釐三不等、倫敦生金縮半便士、英對美升八七五、英對法漲十九磅音、美對英升八七五、美對法長二五、中央銀行掛牌揭曉、英美俱平、海關金單位勿動、匯市晨開、近期賣價、英匯一先令二便士半、美匯三十元一八七五、較之前收、計英平而美鬆〇六二五、良以匯兌上升也、開後以銀行互有對做、匯豐銀行掛牌揭曉、英美俱平而平定、白銀平衡稅揭曉勿動、銀行對掉匯兌、過程更爲平庸、午刻亦因銀行胃口不一而無變化、後市人心平靜、銀行亦居觀望、以致除對做外、投機交易缺乏、過程呆滯、最後印銀雖跌二安那、亦未受任何影響、收盤、近期賣價英匯一先令二便士半、美匯三十元一八七五、較之前收、計英平而美鬆〇六二五、遠期亦然、匯兌軋長之故也、華商缺乏活動、銀行亦對做居多、英美匯兌昨由銀行封做現貨四九九·五、今將一天成交錄後、</p>

<h3>紐的股市　投機家多數看好</h3>
<p>新豐洋行報吿、昨（二十四日）紐的股市、參差帶疲、交易爲木月最淸之一日、惟各股與各部份領袖吿無壓力、其中若美國鋼鐵·克來期勒汽車與紐的中央鐵路等咸頗平靜、若干種低價股票比較活潑、派克汽車之進出允暢、鐵路材料股因鐵路定貨增加、於最後回起、鐵道股則頗靜寂、糖股與股市大勢反道而趨、食品股需要甚佳、酒股堅定、汽車股大體低落、大多數投機家感覺長期展望依舊看好、蓋鐵路收入漸復原狀、鋼鐵廠工作因鐵路與建築業之購買、頗能維持、又天氣漸暖、小交易所股票參差、債市低落、全日成交二百二十萬股、茲將道瓊斯紐的指數列左、</p>
<h3>紗花　紗銷尚好引起補空</h3>
<p>紗市晨跌午回、局勢平靜、但海外紗花狀况一致傾向下游、人心帶挫、午後因現紗銷塲尙堪維持、且日紗市價趨漲、洋行討價殊緊、因此市態復見振作、</p>
<p>標紗先跌後回標紗前市開盤、各月呈疲憊不振之象因國外紗花市價一致下墮、人心虛弱、塲中買戶缺乏、迨至三收盤、聞大阪三品紗步步下降、市况允見挫折、結果各月比上日收盤價均跌七·八·九角至一元、午後開盤市價緩步上昇、因現紗生意尙屬良好、而日紗市價趨漲、現貨根子緊俏、散戶扒補、轉趨高翔、結果各月比上午收價價均漲四·五·六·七角、查賣出賡豐四百五十包、長餘三百包　頤大三百五十包、永大七百包、恒益六百包、瑞大六百包、恒昌六百包、大昶四百五十包、買進吉豐七百五十包、大孚四百五十包、大豐三百五十包、森康六百五十包、大昌成八百包、永昌五百五十包、聚興七百包、合興六百包、　豐六百包、愼昌四百包、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>
<p>蜀津帮採辦現紗現鈔銷路活潑、蜀津兩幫購辦爲多、查全日成交統計一千九百二十包、售價漲五角、各帮買額列下、</p>
<h3>棉市形勢虛弱</h3>
<p>棉市不振、因印美棉市一意低落、而標金市勢無力、人心愈弱、且市傳印度棉（十六支原料）價售四十八元半、做開八千件、謠說極盛、於是棉市愈虛、惟此項事件尙待事實證明也、</p>
<p>標花跌三四角標花前市開盤、因美棉多頭了結而跌八千至十五鎊音、印度棉多頭了結、期貨高賣出而跌〇·七五至二羅比半、大阪三品花跌　·三角、市場人心轉疲、惟上日二月期交割形勢甚緊、今受外棉之壓迫而弱、結果各月比上日收盤價跌三·四·五角、午後開盤尙昂、但市場傳言有大批印棉售開、專作十六支原料、惟經切實調査、何廠何行經售、尙未有正確之消息也、結果各月比上午收盤價漲五分至一角、查賣出同和二千二百擔、潤康二千一百擔、賡豐一千二百擔、源興昌一千一百擔、吉豐一千擔、愼昌一千三百擔、仁豐一千擔、信誠一千五百擔、益康一千二百擔、買進合興二千三百擔、振大一千五百擔、瑞大二千擔、大昌成一千三百擔、永昌一千三百擔、長和一千八百擔、瑞源一千八百擔、森康一千八百擔、元一一千二百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>
<p>現棉廠商觀望現棉消費略淸、因印棉近來步落、廠方均持觀望態</p>
<h3>團棉處依舊出售　各月期美棉一致下跌</h3>
<p>昨美棉開盤、利物浦消息不佳、三月期多頭了結、外商賣出與奔售、並有由三月期移往遠月、各月跌二至十一磅音、旋以同業及現貨商買進近月、略見回好、業外買賣缺乏、同業靜待華盛頓方面之發展、國棉處依然出售現棉、惟政府未有售出期棉、收盤平疲、計現貨跌十叫磅音、期貨跌八至上三磅音、英棉現貨跌七點、期貨跌六七點、印棉期貨商賣出、多頭了結、一部份日商跨買、結果平果兩跌〇·二五至〇、七五羅比、奧姆辣跌二至二·五羅比、白羅溪跌一·五至二羅比、原電錄左、（二十四日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、二十五日白羅溪花之開盤預測、爲一百九十一羅比、較上日收盤跌〇·二五羅比</p>
<p>三品紗花微跌</p>
<p>二十五日大阪電、三品期紗跌三角至八角、近月爲一百八十八元三角、遠月爲一百八十八元一角、期棉跌五分至二角、近月爲六十元四角五分、遠月爲五十八元二角、</p>
<h3>糧食　春雪竟日粉麥飛漲　——洋麥亦爲天時不良——</h3>
<p>粉市上午開盤後、各月份又呈穩健之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥坎拿大均好一二角左右不等、國內天氣、又見春雪迷漫、業內外人心、遂一致良好、近期則實銷略抽、遠期則內地帮吸進、是以各月份均續好一二分左右、迨至下午開盤、初仍穩定、遠期曾續提近分、旋以客帮如營口等多頭、陸續脫手、廠家亦有掉期交易、市面遂見疲滯、觀後步恐以犬時之惡劣、難期鬆落云、</p>
<p>麥市因天時不正、洋麥又稍微好、各月份開價、均呈平穩、迨至下午開盤、近期交易、市不暢遠期則殊見熱閙、因六七月份新麥、照天時不能看低、惟就市値而言、早較往年爲巨大、故遠地客戶、頗有拋售、市氣漲度無幾、當爲此故也、現麥市面、交易不多、價呈平穩、開山東麥五元二角半、滁州麥五元角三分、由福新去四百包、申大去五百包云、</p>
<p>芝加哥小麥、以西南部發生塵颶、麵粉需要進步、國外市面堅定、價格因而升起、惟加麥剩餘山積、恐難大漲、上週可見供給估計减少二、四七九、〇〇〇斛、加麥减少五、一一一、〇〇〇斛</p>
<h3>食米銷路頗有起色　—贛米產地報漲—</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各幫來源祗到二十五號、（貨共五千餘石）、銷場零　兩胃相仿、故市呈平頂、若厚一早粳價悉無上落、薄稻計烟臺等帮去二千餘包、行情亦無進出、杜洋尖及陰變元市亦平定、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源三十二三號、市上各貨去胃、白粳轉活、市價緊扣數分、薄稻零胃平常、價形定勢、羊尖挺立、杜尖定勢、埠客尖去路稍動、市價緊起角外、其餘各貨、價均見定立、以上各貨、雖有做開、但因霪雨不絕、斛出無幾、</p>
<p>（客　）昨日續見起色、因各地來源减少、而本客囤戶銷路續活、市面乃見上升之象、產地允以九江市面最佳、昨日來電報漲至半元左右、因當地有軍需工賑大批去路、存貨被搜一空、當地市價一高、即難合劃來申矣、因此行販一致望好、昨日雖無內地與各客帮暢辦、而行情又見步高五六分、計開出江西米五千一百七十包、湘米八百包、台秈五百包、漢糙二百〇五包、安慶機米一百二十包、大部分爲囤戶收進、本街實胃反占少數、</p>
<p>（洋米）久未見暢、因被客秈影響、行販不肯貶價脫手之故、昨日新到之暹暹米采一批、爲天津帮歡迎、隨市開出四千四百六十三包、高貨九元五角四分、决至八元三角九分、</p>
<h3>連電屢跌油豆受挫　本埠油廠不肯賤售　大連後市已見回張</h3>
<p>豆油市況、本廠油因豆價不賤、油廠大多不願廉價出售　祗有行家回出大有廠油五十件、價爲十八元一角、其餘均比前市轉跌三角五分、計開大連油三百件、價爲十七元八角、速岐油二百件、價爲十七元七角、沙船靑岐油一百件、價爲十七元二角五分、市因大連晨市繼續報跌、故本市人心不免受其牽制、市價內而挫折、但大速收盤價格、反比上日見好、故今日油市、或有回升可能也、</p>
<p>標準油豆餅市況、以邇日大連市價一再回小、市上人心又起恐慌、晨間開盤後、油餅豆各檔一律下跌、午後開盤有一部份補空交易、且據客方接大速私人電訊、後市或有轉機之企圖、因此一部份行號又復乘低買進、而標準車豆、以日來漢口到頭不多、現車豆貨稀銷活、市面久居站局、故市場空氣又復轉變、標豆本月份又以月底交割補空甚健、故市大至五元、比前日收價及本日最低價較漲有一角二三分之多、遠月漲六分八分不等、標油本月不動、餘月各大二三角云、</p>
<h3>糖市　建氷到存俱稀</h3>
<p>昨日糖市、趨勢依然疲弱、蓋連日春雨速綿、繼之以雪、銷胃一時難暢故也、公會劃盤、二四荷粗白現貨、叫二十二元三角半、轉口貨七元二角半，時有成交、比前日均小五分、東糖八號白現貨叫二十一元、轉口七元、稍有劃出、比小二分半、餘叫原價未成、本廠綿白振記一號二十一元一角、二·三·四·五號照退、號貨靑赤糖均乏進出、雙方觀望擯持、後市難免轉跌、建氷連日稍有運到、但爲數甚稀、如五福玉春獅球等牌統共不上二百箱、存底頗覺軋缺、號方本欲加價、因適値粗白等轉跌之時、一時不易拉高、昨市五福氷仍以原價十八元六角開出一批、惟統手氷因貨底更缺、或可加起數角、</p>
<h3>南北貨　雜路桂圓來源日稀</h3>
<p>雜路杜圓、査昨日太原輪入口如同安石碼等貨、統共僅到五十五件、而泉州方面之華平輪、日內亦可抵滬、但據貨主電訊、以地價高昂、並無續裝、故此决泉州圓竟無隻箱運到、貨源之稀、於此可見、</p>
<p>龍口粉回跌半元</p>
<p>龍口綫粉乾產價、前以申甬均有採辦、會達三十六元半、（每包計）、近已回跌元許、故申市因亦轉鬆、昨市行盤叫售二十五元、比前降去半元、兼之現在銷胃見减、趨勢仍軟、後市防有再小之可能、</p>
<h3>絲茶　貢熙綠茶略有走銷</h3>
<p>近日綠茶市況、非常沉靜、路莊土莊兩路珍眉綠茶、因摩洛哥來電認價過低、華商虧折過鉅市面無從開展、惟貢熙綠茶、昨由白頭莊美星裕隆等行買進三百餘箱、係由益隆公升永等茶棧售出、市盤做開十五六元、較前無甚高下、此外秀眉末片等項、福建客幫亦有零星去路云、</p>
<h3>五金　正號馬口鐵存貨稀少</h3>
<p>正號馬口鐵、不論九十磅·一百磅·一百八十磅及二百磅、最近市上流通現貨突缺、標準因供不敷求、紛紛上升、如九十磅英貨開十七元五角、美貨十九元五角、一百磅英貨開十八元五角、美貨二十一元、一百八十磅英貨開三十七元、法貨三十五元、德貨三十七元五角、意貨三十八元、美貨四十元、二百磅英貨開三十九元、法貨三十七元、德貨三十九元五角、意貨四十一元、美貨五十元、交易印刷廠製罐廠油漆公司香烟公司均有吸收、是以市上成交殊爲熱鬧、惟査來源絕少、故標準前途、尙有看好之勢也、</p>
<p>二三兩月份各公債還本付息表</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （顯微生）</p>
<p>庖人井中汲水，要是汲水器不全，只有吊桶，沒有吊桶繩，那井水怎能弔得上岸，以供煮飯燒菜？所以飲水思源，我們不能不歸功於那吊桶繩的，汲引之力，今人往往在失業的時候，倩人汲引起來，說得花好稻好，－决不忘提携之恩，及至位置着落，或以後些微發展了一些，便傲視一切，連着從前汲引的人，也不在他眼裹了，這種忘本的朋友，天下滔滔皆是，要知道，喫飯別忘却種田人哪！</p>
<p>再有一層，有時那弔桶繩很粗很牢，原非常的汲引得起，那知所使用的，是一隻有洞的壞弔桶，那麽糟糕，一滿桶水弔起來，無疑地，一定漏剩半桶，或全數漏光，這不能怪弔桶繩的不得力，應該歸咎於那弔桶自身的不爭氣，所以提拔－汲引，也要看準眼子，可引則引之，吾則，隨便從事，說不定要枉費心機！</p>
<h3>外蒙的哨兵</h3>
<p>— 紫英</p>
<p>在目前日蘇關係正是極度緊張的時候，戰爭大有一觸卽發的可能；處在這兩大勢力的前哨戰的滿蒙衝突，更日漸銳利；這兒，我們對於外蒙古的邊防，大槪都會感覺到典味吧？</p>
<p>我有一位朋友，是在察綏一帶經商的，最近因爲「匪盜」的橫行，才束裝南返，他對我講述了一段外蒙哨兵的故事，現在我就把它記了出來，下面都是他的話：</p>
<p>「三年前，那時侯正是夏末秋初，我受了友朋的慫恿，爲着逐一點蠅頭之利，竟不顧一切的艱難與危險，動了偸入外蒙的决心。</p>
<p>「塞外的天氣是很壊的，允其是沙漠之境；白天，太陽像一團火般燃燒着人們，溫度常在九十多度以上；一到晚上，却冷得要命，非蓋上兩層毛毡不可；我們就在這樣荒凉的原野行旅，一望無垠的沙漠已經行過了五天，大的已到了外蒙的邊境，還是一個人都沒有看見，我們正在慶幸偷渡的成功，可是在第二天就給他們的巡哨兵捉着了。</p>
<p>「剛才已經說過，外蒙的邊疆是沙漠之境，他們哨兵的巡邏就利用着這沙漠，他們都騎着駿馬，往來馳騁。馬後都拖着一把有葉的樹枝，馬一跑起來，樹葉拖在地上，就把沙漠弄得很平，人走在沙上是一定留有痕跡的，他們就跟跡追踪，十有九得了的。</p>
<p>「諸位讀過三國誌，看見張翼德在橫板橋與曹操作戰的時候，不是在樹林中呌士兵馬拴樹葉馳騁，弄得灰塵冲天，作爲疑兵之計嗎？想不到外蒙巡哨兵也用的這樹葉。</p>
<p>「起初他們以爲我們是間諜，看守得很嚴。不過食宿的待遇都很好。後來知道我們都是商人，就把我們押了出境。」</p>
<h3>設館敎授英文之起始</h3>
<p>— 逸梅</p>
<p>上海爲通商巨埠，歐舶東來，貿易素盛，國人紛紛設館敎授英文，靑年子弟爭趨之，至今雖英文已列入學校主要科目，盡人得讀，然英文補習館之招揭，仍觸目於坊里間，考共起始，尙在前淸同治二年正月，其時國人無不以談洋務爲時髦，李少荃允爲深知洋務之一人，乃在上海設立所謂外國語言文字學館，當時曾有奏本中，有云：伏維中國與洋人交接，必先通其志，達其意周知其虛實誠僞，而後有稱物平施之效。我官員紳士中，絕少通習外國語言文字之人，各國在滬，均設立繙譯官一二員，遇中外大臣會商之事，皆憑外國繙譯官傳述，亦難保無偏袒揑架情弊，中國能通洋語者，僅恃通事，遇有交涉事宜，詞氣輕重緩急，往往失共本旨，惟知藉洋人勢力，播弄挑唆，以遂其利，洋務爲國家懐遠招携之要政，乃以樞紐付若輩之手，遂至彼已之不知，情僞之莫辨，操縱進退，訖不得其要領，此非細故也，洋入總匯之地，以上海廣東爲最，臣愚擬請仿照京師同文館之例，於上海添設外國語言文字館，選近郡年十四歲以下，資禀聰頴，根器端靜之文童，聘西人敎習，三五年後，有此一種讀書明理之人，精通番語，凡通商督撫衙門，及海關監督，應添設繙譯官，承辦洋務者，卽於學館中遴選云云，原文甚長，此共節略也。</p>

<p>孔老二曾說：「君子無所爭，心也射乎，」以君子之道德，涵養，尙不能無所爭，那末，咱們因爲下棋而發生爭執甚至吵架，由君子觀之，無足怪也！</p>
<p>世人因爲剃頭師傳常玩象棋，於是就在「象棋」上加個「臭」字，說它「臭象棋」。而考諸中國史乘，「淸談祖師」謝安當他子姪輩在淝水「殺賊立功」時，仍是很鎭靜的在下圍棋。就是南北極兩位星君間暇時也是下的圍棋。象棋之不爲士大夫甚至仙界所重視，蓋已由來久矣！</p>
<p>近來有人和我談起一件「齊東野語」式的笑話：說是有處地方，樓上有二人在下圍棋，樓下攢聚着許多人在玩象棋，後者時常吵起因爲爭執而發生的各種不同的惡聲。因此有位旁觀者喟然歎曰：「究竟是下圍棋的風雅，你聽，樓上可曾有些聲響！祗有你們這班玩臭象棋的才會這樣惡聲大嚷的！」後來「鐘點已到，」玩象棋的已宣告散會，却不見樓上兩個人下來，於是就有人跑上樓去瞧，原來他倆死勁地緊掯着對方的喉嚨，在拚個你死我活呢！」</p>
<p>咱們姑不論這件笑話是吾在打趣在下圍棋的人們，僅就「人情」而言，大都人類知識愈高，所爭必愈大愈烈！「君子無所爭」那套「腐話，」在二十世紀的今日，已是「此路不通」的了！</p>
<h3>記所見</h3>
<p>— （張孟昭）</p>
<p>也算民間時嗎？</p>
<p>某次如厠，偶見板璧上鉛筆寫的打油詩一首，甚趣。不知何許人寫的？詩云：</p>
<p>處女生得好，一雙脚又小年紀三十三，問你要不要？</p>
<p>車輪底下的老年人</p>
<p>「馬路如虎口，當中不可走。」住在步步荆棘的都市裏，這兩句話，大家都知道而牢記的。可是我在前星期日下午句鐘的辰光，目覩一老年人被公共汽車的司機人擅跌，老人正擔米，米亦傾散在地，可憐他一個仰天翻，幾乎送命。旁人不平，奔逐汽車狂駡，可是司機人知道了闖禍，汽車格外駛行得風馳電掣，大家沒來何，只得眼照着老人的哀號，掙扎着從地上爬起。這事是發生在近黃浦碼頭的楊樹浦路。司機人故犯過失，而開足汽車連率逃遁，上海果眞有什麽情理可講呢？這件事似乎不能怪年高耳聾的老年人啊。</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第二十四回　利重美人輕傖夫割愛　志高雙足健壯士投荒</p>
<p>志前道你忙一早上連報都沒有看到，你都幹什麼去了。北海望了張介夫一眼，笑道：這事情……回頭我再來報吿罷。張介夫隨了這情形，點着頭也就走了。志前笑道：你們的談話，我已經知道了。剛才我也在那邊吃午飯聽到老賈那番話。你這孩子未免有點傻氣，爲什麽拒絕他的貢獻？北海紅了臉道：程先生倒聽見了，這有些不像話。志前斟了一杯茶，站在桌子角邊，將手捧住，慢慢的喝，眼睛可由茶杯的熱氣圈子裏，向北海臉上看了來，笑着搖搖頭道：你所說的有些不像話，也許正是有些像話。北海偏了頭向志前回看過去兩手按住了大腿，將脚不住的在地上打點着笑道：程先生以爲這件事是有些可能的。志前道：老實話，那位賈先生娶這位朱姑娘，目的也不過是暫時取樂囚爲在小西天的旅館生活，太枯寂了，把朱姑娘找去和他作伴。可是爲了這點小事，引得婦女界對他羣起而攻，愛情損失事小，敎他在西安進行的事業，受着打擊，那關係太大。他是代表銀行在這裏投資的假如弄得聲名狼藉，事情辦不成功，他在西安失了面子不要緊，回到上海南京去，也沒有了面子，這就和飯碗問題，發生密切關係了。你要知道，這年頭，一切問題，都是以經濟爲背景的。大概他先是爲了而子過不下來，少不得感情衝動着，和人吵了起來。事後自己仔細一想，到底不能逞那一時之勇壊了飯碗，還是忍耐一些的好，讓朱姑娘離開了罷。這個人既是他不能把持住，何如和你作個介紹人。你感激着他，也許會在賣地皮上，帮他一些忙的。把主意想透了，這還是與他有益的所以他有那一番話，志前是帶呷着茶，帶把話說，眼睛自在北海身上打量着，看他臉上，只管把笑容遂漸的加深，似乎他已經回想過來了。於是走過來，拍拍北海的肩膀道：假使你肯信任我，聽我的話去辦，我可以讓你們有情人終成眷屬的。（四〇八）</p>

<h3>盆梅培養法（中）</h3>
<p>— 胡楚玉</p>
<p>灌水大凡盆梅開花的多少，與灌水的適吾，關係很大，普通培養樹木，以多注水爲宜，要花多生，允不可疏忽，倘水少注，則花朶必乾枯，而且木的生育，亦受影響，一多肥少潤」四個字，是使花多生的秘訣。原來梅性好向陽叉好在乾燥地方的，每年在四月初萌芽時到入梅前，充分施給肥料，少用水，就是促其有力發芽，所出的葉，以厚薄而定花芽，薄葉不會生花。梅葉生時，吸水甚多，鉢土容易乾燥，朝灌的水，到了夕間，就要乾燥，我們如見盆土已呈白色，就應灌水，每日灌水的回數，春秋一日一回，盛夏一日二回，冬季隔數日一回，若水過多，那末，芽要脫落，枝亦容易仲長了。（防枝過長，可剪去芽尖）</p>
<p>梅花質素的枝，在入梅前已有一定，等到降梅雨時期，其花芽亦固定了。嫩樹要多開花，在三月底，應暫時使鉢土乾燥，老樹那就不可，花芽固定後，用水應適當，等到葉落後，吸水已少，灌水亦要緩慢，至於所用的水，井水與河水爲最相宜，自來水不可用，冬季結冰的水，因爲溫度太低，亦不相宜，普通須用溫和的淸水，才不會傷害根的。</p>
<p>放梅的地方</p>
<p>應當放在通風向陽的地方，若放在無風半陰之處，徒使枝長，花心不鮮艷，而且容易愛害虫病虫的害，盛夏時候，亦不要放在半陰地方，儘可放在烈日下曝晒的。風强的時候，要防柔枝動搖，或枝與枝的磨擦，倘若栽植甚密，可用細竹支持不使接觸，叉久雨的時期，應當移入簷下。</p>
<p>剪枝與細鐵絲</p>
<p>到了開花後，應發剪定枝葉，嫩樹的新軸，容易伸長，可在新梢基部，殘留一二芽，斟酌出芽的姿勢，整理剪去無用的枝葉但亦有在夏季把過長的新梢剪去的，經過剪截的枝，枝頭雖能生新芽，但這芽不會生花，以不剪爲宜，老樹的新芽，大的長了二三分爲止，無須剪去，不過因爲嫩枝與老枝相並，看起來非常不雅觀，還是剪去爲妥。梅枝到了入梅期，其枝甚柔軟，可把梅枝依所好樣子，用鐵絲盤曲，但鐵絲上應用紙包卷，矯正古枝，在枝上，可卷以麻，徐徐矯正，若要在梅幹上雕刻字畫，或治療樹皮裂傷，那要在春三月修正了。</p>

<h3>久婚不育原因種種</h3>
<p>— 周笑涵</p>
<p>久婚不育之原因。自縱的方面言之。有屬於男子的與屬於女子的之分。自橫的方面言之。有生理的與病理的之分。今茲所欲言者。乃男女雙方之屬於病理之種種原因也。</p>
<p>男子性病。爲不育之最大原因。如罹遺精，早洩，腎痿者。或精薄精枯。或精冷精弱。或射洩過早。或發育不全。或萎頹不振。凡此皆有虧夫職。無從生育者也。</p>
<p>女子隱病。姙娠維艱。或白帶纒綿。糜爛濕癢。或月經不調。前後多少。或宮冷腹疼。無從受精。因女子環境不良。禮敎束縛。翁姑壓迫於上。夫壻箝制於旁。延醫服藥。殊多未便。只得隱諱自秘。因循遷延。病變百出。痛苦迭增。身體瘦弱。健美消失。可哀亦復可憫。</p>
<p>夫性病隱病。或由生殖腺內分泌缺乏及失常而起。非一般普通內分泌製劑或補劑所能奏效。對症發藥。惟生殖腺製劑而已。本刋所載各著名醫師實騐治法之報吿。足供抱伯道憂者之參考也。</p>
<h3>（醫師報吿）早洩治法</h3>

<h3>（來函照登）白帶胃痛自療經騐</h3>
<p>（周廣泰君來函云）余與余妻。各患病痛。纒綿多年。因循未治。（中略）余自苦胃病陣作。不可輟藥。胃呆胃弱。復原爲難。而余妻則白帶淋漓。經來腹痛。試藥殆遍。終無起色。後閱本刋見某君所患胃症。與余相同。而某夫人之隱病。則與余妻相似。卽抄下其所用「胃痛靈」「健胃素」「療帶靈」「女用生殖素」等名藥四種。向太和藥房購取。依法內服外用。余與余妻之病痛。由輕瘥而吿痊瘉。余夫婦之得有今日康健幸福。謂爲名藥之功固可。謂爲貴刋介紹醫藥常識。造福人羣之功。當亦無不可也云。</p>
<h3>（醫師報吿）腎萎根治一例</h3>
<p>（賈治中醫師報吿）患者陳德明。手淫房勞。先後伐傷。其生殖腺形成極度之萎頽。致罹腎痿甚烈。難盡夫職。爲妻所譏。身體瘦弱。病變百出。子嗣絕望。精神痛苦。迭决醫藥。因未對症。致難根治。衰弱愈甚。痛苦頻增。去春自投余處求治。經余對症發藥。囑向永安公司購服「生殖素」。服後其生殖腺頓復壯健。腎痿霍然而起。夫婦感情回復。勝於初婚。最近接其來信伸謝。云其夫人已懷孕足月。雖男女未卜。而名藥起其衰弱。復其生機之功。沒齒亦不忘云。</p>
<h3>（來函照登）月經不調匝月而愈</h3>
<p>（戚盛儀君來函云）內子與舍妹。同患月經不調之症。服藥多種。功效難言。經來時不惟或多或少。或痛或冷。且經期起前落後。從無準確。後舍妹閱貴刋知「女用生殖素」調經有確效。先自向五洲藥房購服治愈。後卽將經過情形吿內子。余卽亦爲購取使服。爲期匝月。果然經調體健。所患若失。余不文。苦不能將戚激之狀儘心描摹。蓋內子現已有孕。且身體壯健。宛如重生矣云。</p>
<h3>（醫師報吿）遺精早洩並治法</h3>
<p>（喬文彬醫師報吿）患者林增年。其生殖腺爲手淫所摧傷。致釀成遺精之症。婚後又覺罹有早洩頗劇。迭服補劑。無從奏效。頭痛腰痠。體顫心悸。呈有衰弱症象綦重。去秋始自投余處求治。經余吿以遺精早洩。雖同爲性病。然非普通補劑可治。卽囑向集成藥房購「生殖素」及「希米脫氏固精片」並服之。服後自覺腰背有力。中氣冲沛。二症並治。各恙俱消。至謂二藥乃其再造之救星云。</p>
<h3>戒烟安全惟仗調理</h3>
<p>— 兪伯符</p>
<p>鴉片中有毒質。暫吸之能振奮精神於一時。掩飾病痛。如連連吸之。則神經轉爲麻痺。非大量吸取。無以振作。其所以中毒成癮。癮愈重而毒愈深也。</p>
<p>邇者吸烟之末日已降臨。設非及早戒除。極刑行將加身。然吸者習慣成性。一旦中輟。精神萎頓。病痛湧現。苦不堪言。戒烟安全問題，遂成爲戒烟聲中當務之急。</p>
<p>夫戒烟原理。一在去毒。二在斷癮。然如不治其病痛。補其精神。則欲求全功。戞乎其難。此其所以半途而廢。功虧一簣也。</p>
<p>戒烟時如餌服生殖腺製劑。則病痛既瘳。精神煥發。烟毒祛除。烟癮自斷。此爲欲自拔於黑籍者所不可不知也。</p>
<p>男子戒烟調理。可服「生殖素」。女子戒烟調理。可服「女用生殖素」。功效雖同。生理有殊。一般普通戒烟調理品。不分男女。一藥並用。實未盡善。戒烟欲奏全功者。其注意之。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>天津暖廠慘劇</h3>
<p>— 炘炘</p>
<p>據最近各報的天津通訉所載的暖廠大火慘劇，眞使人不忍卒讀之烕，我們所見到的，還祗是報紙上的通訉和照片，便已經有這樣的感覺，如果是當時目睹這慘狀，或是事後到那邊去實地觀察一番的，其傷心慘目之印象，不知更將如何十百倍於現在？</p>
<p>暖廠內部之構造皆為易於燃燒之物，那已經是極危險的了，而這「易於燃燒」之物包構成的暖廠，復於晚間將「蓆門封鎖」，旣將「蓆門封鎖，又無管理之人」，待到一有火災，造成這樣空前的慘禍，原是可以意想得到的。</p>
<p>慈善事業祇能消極地收到免得貧民鋌而走險的效用，在這次事件中是更顯明的告訴出來。况且世有以「慈善起家」的「善棍」，則慈善事業在社會中究有怎樣的價値？也無容我們多說便能瞭然的了。</p>
<p>慈善事業祇有緩和貧民的感情，那在這次事件中是更顯明的，（以「貧民視為福地，爭相趨住廠內！雖在嚴寒之際，亦極安適，甚至人力車夫及小販等亦多有棄而就之者」便能證明）不過這些消極的作用收到的後果如何呢？曰：養成貧民的惰性。不信，有事實為證：「明德兩個暖廠及華商公會之男女施粥廠，今早全數被焚後，一般依賴食粥之男婦貧民，因粥廠被焚已不能就食，同時暖被焚，夜晚亦無地安身，貧民等無不大失所望。」</p>
<p>沒有粥廠的設旋，貧民處在「嚴寒之際」會有若干的餓死凍死，那是事實。不過，他們為了和死抗爭，因而去找一條生路，那也是必然的，這種謀生技能的獲得，和現在被焚以後的「不能就食」和「無地安身」比較起來，又有怎樣的分別？這明眼人都能知道，再用不到我們曉曉不休。卽使退一步言說是如此於「嚴寒之際」，於貧民能有一個「亦極安適」的「福地」，以示「與民同樂」的微意，則這兩個暖廠實在有太少之感，普天之下（卽使小而至於天津一地罷）有要享受「亦極安適」的「福地」的身份者，是多着吶！</p>
<p>或者說，慈善事業於現社會制度下，實在是一種沒有辦法中的辦法，在整個社會制度沒有澈底改革前，這辦法還是於貧民最月利的。不過我仍終於還不能無言者，則是在「鉅災」之後，竟有人「以百餘人遭慘刦，持令第一分局約請僧道念經超度」這件事。。這種昏庸荒唐的事兒，無論如何終不是於貧民最月利的了。</p>
<p>這樣我們還談什麼呢！</p>
<h3>舊居</h3>
<p>— 羅之華</p>
<p>林子彬是一個充滿了幻想和回憶的傢伙，他所以要生活好像完全為了過去的迷惑。</p>
<p>我認識他還在四年前，九一八事件發生以後，在北平的一家公寓里，那時北平好像給開水澆着的蟹子一樣，每天每天地動亂着，恐慌支配了這世界。昔日古老的空氣，被山海關外襲進來的寒流冰醒了。不但是空氣使人底腦子淸楚了，以關外逃進來的人們底苦痛的臉，也使人明白一個怎樣的戲劇演出或就要演出了。</p>
<p>那時候，我在北平讀書，下課後時常到同鄕那里去玩。有一次就碰到林子彬。</p>
<p>他頎長的身體，上按着一個小小的腦袋，看云非常不順眼。別的倒都滿好的，頭髪黑而發光，眼睛明朗地轉着。嘴唇好像塗過口紅似的鮮明。說話時用着低低的細細的女子的腔調。</p>
<p>我第一次見到他的時候，有些不高興：他沒有魄力。所以沒有多談話。後來同鄕告訴我說：這傢伙剛從東北跑回來，預備到我們學校里去讀文科。第二次見到他的時候，我把聲音放得低低地像一個小學敎員騙取學生底眞心話似地說：</p>
<p>「密絲特林預備進學校麼？」</p>
<p>他從「幻想與回憶里驚欵地回過頭來，裂開那鮮明的嘴唇，笑了說：「我預備進貴校的文科。」</p>
<p>「哦，」我答應着他，兩隻眼泩視他的動作，他好像怕我似的，臉子有些紅，手脚都找不到合適的地方放，我察覺到這一點的時候，馬目把視綫轉移到正在習作一篇速寫的同鄕，同時說：「那好極了，我們又多了一個伙伴！」他只羞怯地笑子。</p>
<p>以後，因為學校里組織南下進京請願團，我們都參加，談話的機會多起來，大家也就熟了。</p>
<p>在請願團里，因為他是東北人，所以特別地熱情與瘋狂。他每天興奮着他底小紅臉吵：</p>
<p>「只要照我想的那校，政府出兵收復失地，我情願回去當兵！……你不知道，東北的大草野多麼……」</p>
<p>每次有了空閒的時候，他就告訴我們東北的情况，為了補足他描寫的不够，還把五六本貼得頗為整齊美麗的照片來給我們看。大半都是風景和他底家庭的攝影，在這些片中他最愛一張在花園中佇立着的小洋房了。每次看到那張畫，都是不嫌俗氣地重說一啟遍：</p>
<p>「這就是我住的地方。」手指在那畫上點着，好像又沉醉在回憶里了：「這一帶景眞好，往外一看，是大的平原，的冬天全是白雪，夏天全是碧草。我底這座房子就是這里。是我父親當旅長的時候修築的。特呌我住。…唉，你不知道，這房子是紅色的瓦，和四周的襯景配合起來是怎樣地合適呀！……像一朶鮮艷的紅花，立在緣葉里一樣……我有八百塊錢的日文的文學書，全放在這里面，我底未完成的傑件「我踟踟在廣漠的北荒」也放在這里面，……可是九一八的時候全去了。……」</p>
<p>他拿着那冊照像簿，沉在回憶與幻想里了。</p>
<p>不但是他這樣，和他同來的幾個少爺也是這樣，在當時北平的報紙副刋中時當有他們底文章，文章底內容就是懷念着他底荒漠的滿州平原。無論是散文也好，詩歌也好。林子彬底「我踟踟在廣漠的北荒」底內容也是這樣。</p>
<p>所以以後我們見到林子彬就說：「最近又寫了些回憶嗎？」</p>
<p>「不，」另一個說：「他全在幻想，他把他底家幻想得比以前美麗一百倍了！」</p>
<p>他驗紅紅地微笑了一下說：「不的不的，我只是太，太，……太悲傷了！太憂鬰了！」</p>
<p>在南京的時候，他也是很悲傷的，看到一座紅房子就說：「唉，太像我底那座了！……我幾時才能重新見到呀！……那美麗的房子，那荒凉的滿洲，戀人的滿洲呀！」低低地吹着口哨，嘆息了！</p>
<p>可是他沒法不住在北平的一家公庽里。向家里去信，家里沒有回信，只有一位年老的父親了呀。同時生活也就越法不好過。生活越苦，對於過去的美夢也就越覺得甜蜜。</p>
<p>匆匆地四年過去了，他底的生活就完全建築在寫一點文章上。聽輿，一個月中簡單是和窮做了親愛的朋友。</p>
<p>去年冬天，我匆匆地到北平去看在學校里的哥哥，同時會晤一下分別許久的同學的時候，也見到他。他底嘴唇已經蒼白，臉子也不再紅潤，反而更瘦了。和只顯得頑長的身體比起來，更加不配合。手像只剩下幾根骨頭，我握緊他底手說：</p>
<p>「生活怎麼樣？」</p>
<p>「我呵，」還是像沉醉在回憶里：「還不是那一回事！……」</p>
<p>問朋友，朋友告訴我，他底父親被××人打死了，因為他不願做漢奸。林子彬呢，也就更加憂鬰，更加沒有力量從幻想與回憶的泥沼拔出脚來。現在只希望有一天開仗，他說：「我一定去打前敵！」</p>

<h3>Mongolian Political Affairs Council Section Chiefs and Soldiers Telegraph to Beijing Reporting Departure from the Temple. Rumors Abound After Prince Teh's Departure Eastward. The Situation in Bailingmiao is Deteriorating. Officials and Soldiers Seek a Place to Assemble and Await Assistance from the Central and Local Governments.</h3>
<p>Nanjing. Xue Jixian, Chief of the Security Section of the Mongolian Political Affairs Council, Su Ludai, Chief of the Civil Affairs Section, Jia Hongzhu, Chief of the Education Department, Ren Bingjun, Chief of the Finance Committee, Kang Jimin, Counselor, and others, stated that since Prince Teh had gone east and rumors were rampant, the situation in Bailingmiao had deteriorated. On the 21st of this month, they jointly led more than 100 staff members and more than 1,000 officers and soldiers to leave Bailingmiao and gather in a place south of the temple, awaiting assistance from the central and local authorities. On the 25th, Yun Jixian and others sent a telegram to the military and political authorities in Beijing, reporting on the departure from the temple. The original telegram is recorded as follows (titles omitted): Jixian and others have served in the Bailingmiao Mongolian Political Affairs Council for two years, diligently performing their duties, and deeply hope that Mongolia, under the leadership of the central government, will obey Prince Teh and increase the welfare of the people. However, since Prince Teh went east last winter and has not returned, the situation in the temple has become increasingly unfavorable. It is said that the West Sunite Banner has organized a military government, or that Prince Teh has appointed Li Shouxin as the Minister of Military Affairs, or that the six counties of Chahar North will change the year and establish a new reign title. Rumors abound and there is no consensus. In particular, news is blocked, there is no opportunity to meet and report, and there is no way to convey the situation below, while those in charge of the council keep everything secret, and even endanger life. Jixian and others had no choice but to lead more than 1,000 officers and soldiers, and jointly more than 100 staff members, to leave Bailingmiao on the 21st and gather in a place south of the temple, awaiting assistance from the central and local authorities. The following statement is hereby made:</p>
<p>Jixian and others are all young Inner Mongolians who graduated from universities and military academies in Nanjing and Beiping. Recently, due to the unclear situation of Prince Teh and the blockade of news, they felt their lives were in danger and fled. Driven by patriotic enthusiasm and without betraying the principles of the country, there is no so-called struggle or rebellion. When they left, there were only a dozen or so people left in the temple. Although they treated Jixian and others improperly, Jixian and others will never retaliate. There was no disturbance when leaving the temple, and no money was taken. The local administration was also strictly enforced, and order was as usual, which can prove that what Jixian and others did can be called avoiding disaster, and it can also be called patriotism and turning to the right. The Suiyuan Mongolian Political Affairs Council has been established, and the powers of the old political affairs council are of course limited to the administration of Chahar Province. The division is very clear. Jixian and other Western Mongolian youths are in the majority and should no longer be under the command of the old Mongolian Political Affairs Council. Therefore, they decided to withdraw, although it was a last resort, it was also a natural action. Fearing that the news from afar is inaccurate or that the council will make false accusations, the process is hereby announced, hoping for consideration. Xue Jixian, Chief of the Security Section, Su Ludai, Chief of the Civil Affairs Section, Jia Hongzhu, Chief of the Education Department, Ren Bingjun, Chief of the Finance Committee, Kang Jimin, Counselor, led more than a thousand people, including colleagues, officers, and soldiers, and kowtowed.

<h3>Yomi Leaves Tianjin and Flies to Changchun, Meets with the Commander in the South, and then Returns Home. Submits a Petition to Expand the Garrison in North China. There Will Be Changes in the Current Military Officers.</h3>
<p>Tianjin. Chief of Staff Yomi and Staff Officer Lin left Tianjin by Kwantung Army reconnaissance plane at 9:00 am on the 25th and flew to Changchun to meet with the Commander in the South. After the meeting, they will return home to submit a petition to expand the garrison in North China and develop the economy. They can return within a week. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>Tianjin. Colonel Yomi, Chief of Staff of the Chinese Garrison Army, accompanied by Staff Officer Lin, took a plane at 9:00 this morning and hurriedly left here for Tokyo via "Manchuria". Because Deputy Chief of Staff Sugiyama postponed his inspection of China and "Manchuria", he went to Tokyo to report on the general situation in North China. It is said that he carried concrete plans for anti-communist work and the expansion of the garrison in North China related to it. (Dentsu News Agency dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>Tokyo. The central authorities and the local authorities have completed detailed consultations and agreements on the plan to increase, expand, and strengthen the Chinese Garrison Army. An agreement has been reached on the implementation within March. The required funds will be transferred from the budget for the Manchurian Incident of this year. Therefore, the commander of the reorganized Chinese Garrison Army will be filled by a senior officer of the division commander level or above, and the chief of staff will be a major general. In Beiping, a major general will be permanently stationed in the Chinese Garrison Army headquarters to be responsible for liaison with the North China government. These opinions are relatively strong. If so, the North China Garrison Army will have a new lineup, and its future work in North China will be extremely noteworthy. (Dentsu News Agency dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>Tokyo. The transfer of army personnel issued on the 24th is due to the need to strengthen the troop strength stationed in "Manchuria" and strengthen the troops stationed in China. The scope of the transfer is quite wide. The transfer of military councilors, military commanders, and division commanders was implemented in December last year, so it has been decided that, except for two or three people, there will be no particularly large movements in the middle-level personnel. It is noteworthy that Deputy Chief of Staff Sugiyama concurrently serves as a military councilor with equal qualifications because Lieutenant Generals Koiso and Yanagawa have already been promoted to army commanders and will be promoted to generals this autumn. It is noteworthy that Kaoyue, commander of the 12th Division, is attached to the General Staff Headquarters. After the expansion and strengthening of the troops stationed in China, the commander will be selected from among the generals or lieutenant generals with strong capabilities, so Kaoyue is temporarily attached to the General Staff Headquarters for recommendation. Also, Major General Kida is transferred to the General Staff Headquarters, which can also be regarded as waiting for promotion to the chief of staff after the strengthening of the troops stationed in China. Major General Matsui was appointed to the Kwantung Army Headquarters, and there is a possibility that he will succeed Lieutenant General Doihara as the director of the Fengtian Special Service Agency. The newly appointed head of the press corps, Colonel Kaneda, is an expert in Soviet Russia. At a time when the relationship between Russia and Russia is tense, his appointment is quite appropriate. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>Tokyo. According to the news published in today's Asahi Shimbun, the Japanese Garrison Army in North China will undergo major changes in March, and its number may be doubled compared to today. It is said that the current commander of the Japanese Garrison Army in North China, Major General Tada, will be replaced by Lieutenant General Koseki next month, and Major General Kida will be appointed as the chief of staff. The newspaper also predicts that Doihara will be promoted to lieutenant general, and Major General Matsumuro will replace him as the director of the Shenyang Special Service Agency.

<h3>Ministries of Finance and Railways Announce the Method for Reorganizing the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Debt. Four-Fifths of the Interest is Waived, and the Repayment Period is Extended by More Than 30 Years.</h3>
<p>Nanjing. The original Tianjin-Pukou Railway loan from the United Kingdom and Germany was 5 million pounds. Subsequently, another 4.8 million pounds of British and German bonds were issued. Excluding those that have been repaid and those that have not been issued, the total amount of outstanding British-issued, German-issued, original loans, and renewed loans is 6.15 million pounds in English gold. Since the Republic of China in 1925, the repayment of principal and interest on these bonds has not been fulfilled as scheduled, causing the bonds to fall to more than 30% of their face value. After repeated protests and negotiations by our side, the disasters and misfortunes of the past few years have been continuous, and the income of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway has no surplus to take care of its credit. According to reliable information, the creditors recently agreed to waive four-fifths of the interest due and unpaid, and agreed to accept half of the interest for the next three years, so that the Chinese government could reduce its debt burden by 50 million yuan. Considering the current financial difficulties of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, they agreed to extend the repayment period by more than 30 years. With this sincere consultation, the Ministries of Finance and Railways have now finalized the reorganization plan. It is also heard that the Ministry of Railways is strictly ordering the railway bureau to increase revenue and reduce expenditure, hoping to barely raise 2 to 3 million yuan each year to pay half of the prescribed interest. As for the repayment of principal, it will not start until 1940. The reorganization plan and the statements of the British and German bondholders are recorded as follows: The Ministries of Finance and Railways announced the reorganization plan and notice for the reorganization of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway debt:</p>
<p>Method of paying interest: From 1936 to 1938, 2.5% interest will be paid each year. From 1939, the original contract stipulation of 5% interest will be restored.</p>
<p>Method of repaying principal: Repayment of principal will begin in 1940. The amount of principal repaid each year will be based on the total cash revenue of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. It is estimated that 1% of the total cash revenue will be allocated each year from 1940 to 1942. 1.5% will be allocated in 1943, 2% will be allocated in 1944, and 0.5% will be increased each year thereafter. It is estimated that 10% will be allocated in 1960. From 1961, 12.5% will be allocated each year until the principal is repaid. It is expected that all bonds can be repaid around 1966, but the government reserves the right to repay the principal in advance and declares that no additional subsidies will be issued if the principal is repaid in advance. Bonds that have been drawn but have not been paid will be repaid in the order of the previous draws.</p>
<p>Method of reducing overdue interest: The bondholders agree to waive four-fifths of the interest due and unpaid. The bondholders also agree to waive four-fifths of the interest reduced from 1936 to 1938. The part that is not waived will be issued as interest-free small notes, which will be amortized over 20 years from 1941. The amount amortized each year will be roughly the same, but the first three years will be amortized at half the amount due, and the remaining half will be made up in installments in the last three years. No interest will be paid on this postponement.</p>
<p>Source of funds for repayment of principal and interest and guarantee of interest: All funds for repayment of principal and interest will be paid from the total cash revenue of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. However, in order to fulfill the provisions of Article 9 of the loan contract, the Ministry of Finance will order the Chief Inspector of Customs to guarantee to make up for any shortfall in the funds allocated by the railway for the payment of interest under this reorganization plan from the surplus of customs duties. The above measures are the result of negotiations between the government and the representatives of British-issued and German-issued bondholders of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway over the past two years. It is estimated that the principal reorganized by this decision is 6.15 million pounds in English gold. The Minister of Railways is now ordering the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bureau to earnestly rectify railway affairs and improve the management of the railway bureau, in order to increase the railway's income and consolidate the interests of both the government and the bondholders. In this decision to discuss the reorganization plan, the creditors expressed their spirit of sacrifice and cooperation everywhere, so that the long-pending debt could be resolved at once. From then on, China's railway debt will surely see daily improvement. The two ministers expressed their deep happiness. According to reliable information, the representatives of the British-issued and German-issued bonds of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway published a declaration in London newspapers on the 25th, stating that although the reorganization plan for the Tianjin-Pukou Railway debt announced by the Chinese government was not satisfactory, it was not easy under the current financial difficulties in China. They strongly urged the bondholders to weigh the sacrifices and accept it. It is also heard that Reuters has obtained the full text of this declaration and will be published soon. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>London. When the House of Commons discussed the Tianjin-Pukou Railway debt, Guo Taiqi, the Chinese Minister to the United Kingdom, announced here today the method for China to clear the 6.15 million pounds of Tianjin-Pukou Railway loans from 1908 to 1910. The main points are as follows: From 1936 to 1938, interest will be paid at a rate of 2.5% per year. After 1938, interest will be paid at a rate of 5% per year. Repayment of principal will begin in 1940 and will be amortized over the years, depending on the gross profit earned by the railway, so that this debt can be cleared within 40 years after 1936. Four-fifths of the interest due and four-fifths of the interest from 1936 to 1938 must be cancelled. The Chinese Bondholders Committee has advocated accepting this method, saying that this is the best method that can be obtained in the current environment, but as far as the contractual relationship between the bondholders and the Chinese government is concerned, the committee cannot be responsible. At the same time, Conservative Party member Morell raised a discussion in the House of Commons regarding the Tianjin-Pukou Railway bonds. Foreign Secretary Eden replied that the special reserve fund established by the Chinese government to allocate funds on a monthly basis to clear the Tianjin-Pukou Railway debt is actually used to clear the original and additional debts. Interest has been paid for 11 years on the basis of coupons, and the funds allocated to the reserve fund continue to be paid. (Reuters dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<h3>Hebei Provincial Department of Education Orders to Stop Student Patriotic Movements. The Kwantung Army Department in Japan Pays Attention to the Student Unrest in Peiping.</h3>
<p>Peiping. According to the Chinese newspaper, the police chief of the Japanese Consulate in Peiping, after receiving a telegram from the Kwantung Army, visited the mayor of Peiping, Qin Dechun, and the director of the Public Security Bureau, Chen Xiwu, to inquire about the student unrest in Peiping in detail, and expressed his willingness to cooperate with the Chinese officials to eliminate the communists in Peiping.

<h3>Southwest Political Council Cables to the Central Government Opposing the Three Principles of Japan</h3>
<p>Hong Kong. The Political Council telegraphed the Central National Government on the 25th, saying that the talk of convening a so-called adjustment meeting between China and Japan is becoming more and more prevalent. It is heard that the discussion will focus on the three principles proposed by Japan: 1. China must abandon the strategy of using barbarians to control barbarians; 2. China must recognize the existence of "Manchukuo"; 3. China must adopt measures to prevent communism in North China with Japan. Inferring from the spirit of these three principles, Japan regards us directly as its protectorate, and treats the provinces and regions of North China as its affiliated areas for its own use. If we accept this, the national dignity will be completely damaged. It is hoped that the government will refute it with reason and eliminate all diplomatic secrets to allow the world to see it together. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>

<h3>Ambassador Arida's Arrival in China</h3>
<p>— Gao</p>
<p>The newly appointed Japanese Ambassador, Mr. Arida Hachirō, has departed from Kobe for China and is expected to arrive in Shanghai today. Arida's visit is accompanied by new instructions from Foreign Minister Hirota, preparing for concrete negotiations with our country's authorities. The uncertain Sino-Japanese relationship may have a chance to be resolved. As a national standing, I express my full enthusiasm and cannot help but express my thoughts at the beginning of Ambassador Arida's tenure.</p>
<p>The voices of Sino-Japanese cooperation have been noisy for a long time but have not stopped. However, the deformed organization of East Hebei has not been eliminated, and the gloomy situation in North China still looms. The behind-the-scenes planning of strategists has become more active, and reports of instigation by traitors have been repeatedly cited. How can this show us the path to integrity and faith? If Japan can truly "sense the overall situation in East Asia and base it on mutual trust and long-term planning," as Ambassador Arida said when he was about to leave, then Japan should first change its past policies, stop oppressive actions, and seek equal and mutually beneficial cooperation in a sincere and understanding spirit. Because of our love for peace, we have never been willing to suppress the pain of wounds and look forward to the opening of a new situation. If we only regard waving a five-stringed zither and sending off flying geese as the ability of diplomacy, it is not what we are happy to hear.</p>
<p>It is also said that after Ambassador Arida's arrival, he should have a clear understanding of the national psychology of our country, and he should also have a real reflection on the past facts caused by the soldiers of his country. According to Ambassador Arida's talks at the welcome meeting of the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry, it seems that he still has a lack of understanding of our country's attitude. The persistence of this prejudice is enough to cause our concern. Just like Tada's remarks in Ping, thinking that "both countries' authorities should bear the responsibility and cannot only blame others but not blame themselves," after our analysis, it is really a feeling of crying and laughing. If Tada, in his position, can know how to blame himself, it is really a blessing for the future of peace. If we are also asked to generate a sense of self-blame, with our stupidity, we really cannot find any mistake to admit. If we must reluctantly find a word, then "a common man is innocent, but he is guilty of possessing jade," and we will only admit it. Finally, I dare to extract a few words from Ambassador Arida's farewell feelings to Ambassador Ariyoshi and offer them to Ambassador Arida: "Looking at the recent Japanese thinking, it seems that everything Japan does is right, and foreign opinions that violate Japan's claims are wrong. This matter seems to need to be careful to a certain extent. It is true that belittling oneself does not gain the respect of others, but arrogantly saying that everything other than what the Japanese do is evil, this statement may need to be reflected on." I sincerely hope that Ambassador Arida can repeat these words and use reflection as a basis to find a way of negotiation, then the settlement of disputes between China and Japan will be half thought over.</p>
<h3>Communist Prevention in Northern Hebei</h3>
<p>Peiping. According to sources from the Chinese side here, northern Hebei has now been divided into four regions to jointly prevent communist riots. Participants in this task are the 32nd Army under Shang Zhen, the 29th Army under Song Zheyuan, the 53rd Army under Wan Fulin, and the 63rd Army under Feng Zhanhai. Song Zheyuan previously wanted to appoint Shi Yousan as the commander of the Peiping Security Team and Sun Dianying as the commander of the Daming Security Team, but this has now been abandoned. Song has given Sun 10,000 yuan and asked him to recuperate in Ping. Shi resides in Tianjin. (Reuters dispatch on the 25th)</p>

<h3>Four-Nation Naval Agreement Expected to be Signed This Week. Britain Does Not Insist on Seeking Germany's Consent. France Abandons the Issue of Linking Naval and Air Force Armaments.</h3>
<p>London. Naval circles believe that the qualitative limitation agreement for naval forces can be formally signed within this week. Britain originally intended to seek Germany's consent before signing the four-nation naval agreement, but has now abandoned this proposal. The draft agreement does not include political issues or issues related to the mutual connection between naval and air force armaments. (Havas dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>London. After the British delegation to the Naval Conference held talks with the delegations of the countries concerned, including the US delegation, last week, it has now become clear that political issues should not be mixed into the technical agreement on qualitative limitations of naval forces. Otherwise, the final failure is inevitable. The Italian delegation has expressed its views on the fact that the country was unable to participate in the political agreement during the sanctions period. The French delegation requested that the issue of air force armament limitation be resolved before inviting Germany to participate in the naval agreement. The US delegation was limited by the instructions of its own government and had no right to sign any protocol or agreement containing political clauses. Seeing that the attitudes of these countries were mutually contradictory, Britain changed its attitude and considered the establishment of a technical agreement to be sufficient. In addition, the British government had contacted the German government through diplomatic channels last night in order to obtain information on Germany's shipbuilding program based on the Anglo-German Naval Agreement in May last year, so that it was not necessary to invite Germany to participate in the naval agreement. (Havas News Agency dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>London. Chief Representative Picia of the Naval Conference and British Naval Minister Monsell held a long meeting today. Picia informed Monsell of Rome's latest instructions. The meeting lasted from 3:30 pm to 6:30 pm. Both men were silent after the meeting, but it is not admitted that Picia raised the issue of sanctions. It is generally speculated that Italy will reiterate that the Italian government's signature on naval treaties is conditional on the satisfactory resolution of political disputes. US Chief Representative Davis then visited Monsell. The situation at the Naval Conference has not seen any progress today. Monsell will meet with Picia again tomorrow. France is now also firmly insisting that any naval treaties involve political events, while Davis is strongly opposed to this action, so the Naval Conference is now clearly in a very difficult position. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>London. Italy notified Britain today that Italy has no intention of signing the naval agreement until the League of Nations cancels the sanctions plan and the British Navy withdraws its increased fleet from the Mediterranean. This move is tantamount to a blow to the London Naval Conference. US Chief Representative Davis and British Naval Minister Monsell held a two-hour meeting to discuss the recent developments. Davis expressed surprise today at the statement made by the French representative that France is now awaiting Washington's reply to Paris's proposal to limit the tonnage and caliber of battleships, saying that he had notified the French representative of the United States' unwillingness to express its approval of this limitation.

<h3>Inventor of Airplane Bombs Invents Super Dreadnought; U.S. Navy Department Considering His Plan</h3>
<p>Stanford, USA – Mr. Barr, the inventor of airplane bombs, today claimed that he has invented a super dreadnought that is invulnerable to torpedo attacks, heavy artillery bombardment, and aerial explosions. This battleship has an outer protective armor made of non-metallic materials. The ship is equipped with two torpedo launchers on each side, capable of firing torpedoes two at a time per minute. Each ship has a tonnage of at least 85,000 tons and a speed of 15 nautical miles per hour. According to Mr. Barr, the U.S. Navy Department is currently considering his plan, and both the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom also want to purchase his plan. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary Addresses the House of Commons on the International Situation; Strengthen Military Affairs and Uphold Collective Security; Opposition Party Advocates Immediate Oil Embargo</h3>
<p>London – After assuming the position of British Foreign Secretary, Mr. Eden made his first important statement in the House of Commons last night regarding the international situation. His speech can be divided into three parts: the first part concerned the Abyssinian (Ethiopian) question, the second part presented his views on some events not directly related to the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, and the third part discussed the general international situation, explaining the reasons why Britain must increase military expenditure. The British Foreign Secretary's speech was made during a debate on foreign affairs in the House of Commons.</p>
<p>Opposition leader Mr. Smith initiated the debate, criticizing the government's indecision on the sanctions issue. He advocated that the government should strive to implement an oil embargo immediately and stop supplying aggressor nations with livestock, cotton, and other goods. Liberal Party leader Mr. Sinclair agreed with the above proposal, saying that even if the United States does not participate in the oil embargo, it must be implemented, and coal, iron, copper, and other materials should also be embargoed to completely sever economic relations with Italy. Conservative Mr. Amery uniquely held a dissenting view, advising the government not to blindly follow sanctions, but to seek solutions based on the advantages and disadvantages of the matter, rather than on the idea of punishing Italy.</p>
<h3>Achievements of Sanctions Against Italy</h3>
<p>Foreign Secretary Mr. Eden rose to speak amidst applause, recounting past events, saying that within ten days after the outbreak of the war, Italy was declared an aggressor nation by the League of Nations' Executive Council, and this verdict was subsequently approved by fifty member states in the General Assembly. A committee was then established to propose four measures for implementing sanctions against Italy. The noteworthy achievement was the speed of progress, rather than delay. The tasks undertaken by the Coordination Committee and its subcommittees were the arduous work of planning sanctions. The sanctions on financial matters and the rejection of Italian exports could not, of course, be immediately effective; this was obviously visible. The goal was to gradually replace Italy's purchasing power with that of other countries.</p>
<p>Italy's Financial Resources Are Gradually Depleted</p>
<p>According to statistics, Italy's exports to League of Nations member states usually account for 70% of its total exports. Now, the aggressor nation's purchasing power abroad has been greatly reduced as a result of the sanctions. A country in this situation can, of course, continue to purchase abroad to the extent permitted by its gold reserves and foreign exchange, but in this situation, the country's funds will inevitably decrease rapidly, and eventually it will completely lose its purchasing power. Looking at Italy's recent efforts, it can be seen that Italy is now deeply aware of the importance of sanctions. The impact of the war is continuous and cumulative, and will eventually have an important force to achieve the main goal of the League of Nations. What is the main goal? That is, a ceasefire.</p>
<p>Study of the Oil Embargo Issue</p>
<p>What the League of Nations is currently considering is the sanctions on goods, and the source of supply of these goods is mostly in the hands of non-League of Nations member states. In their view, the oil embargo is the same as the sanctions on other goods, and must be judged by the same standard, that is, whether its implementation can help to stop the war. Because stopping the war is the common goal of all countries attending the Geneva Conference, governments must study it in this spirit and then decide. As for how to decide, he cannot say anything, because the governments of the League of Nations member states are currently carefully studying the expert report, which has not yet been completed.</p>
<p>Britain Still Acts Collectively</p>
<p>The British government has done what it can to facilitate the convening of this committee. The sooner the committee can decide, the more beneficial it will be to the matter. At the same time, the British government has not abandoned its original resolution on the oil embargo in principle, nor has it canceled its determination to take collective action with other League of Nations member states on agreed matters. The British government's policy remains to maintain a steady and collective resistance to aggression. Any decision of the British government should be based on the spirit of the League of Nations itself. There should be no sign of weakness or concession until a peace agreement is signed.</p>
<p>The League of Nations' Credibility Has Greatly Increased</p>
<p>We should not weaken our support for the League of Nations simply because it is not omnipotent. Although the League of Nations cannot accomplish everything, it has never failed to accomplish many things. In the past eighteen months, the League of Nations' credibility has greatly increased, and its power has come with its credibility. Today, some people regard the League of Nations as a dangerous object, but anyone who knows a little about diplomacy does not regard the League of Nations as insignificant today. The League of Nations has two qualities: one is the passive task of the police, and the other is the constructive work of mediators and peacemakers. The two are completely different. What people urgently hope for is to see a satisfactory solution to the Italian-Abyssinian dispute.</p>
<p>Peace Negotiations Have Not Been Abandoned</p>
<p>At this point in his speech, the British Foreign Secretary proceeded to describe the report of the Five-Nation Committee appointed by the League of Nations' Executive Council last September to study the basis for a solution that would satisfy all parties, saying that unfortunately, the terms of the report were not accepted by the Italian government at the time. However, from the British government's point of view, this report can still serve as the basis for future mediation. He felt that it was necessary to explain what kind of purpose the League of Nations held when conducting sanctions. Although sanctions are unwelcome to all of us, they are tools to achieve our goals, and the goal is to establish a solution in accordance with the principles of the League of Nations, so that both sides have a lasting and normal relationship. He hoped that the Five-Nation Committee's report would not be forgotten or shelved. According to the British government, the appropriate place to reopen peace talks is Geneva, because the atmosphere there is the most suitable.</p>
<p>When he goes to Geneva again to discuss the sanctions issue in the future, he will make clear and precise statements with the full agreement of the House of Commons, declaring that the British government and people are willing to actively cooperate with other countries to implement sanctions, but are willing to see peace restored between Italy and Abyssinia on a fair basis first.</p>
<p>The Covenant Does Not Need to be Revised</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary finally mentioned the proposal to amend the League of Nations Covenant, saying that now is not the appropriate time to revise the Covenant. He then touched on the issue of raw materials, saying that the government is willing to study the issue of colonial raw materials mentioned by Sir Samuel Hoare at any time, but this is ultimately not a panacea. This issue is extremely complex.</p>
<p>Two Conditions for a Collective System</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary then generally discussed the international situation, saying that eighteen years after the Great War, countries are again encountering terrible problems that are exactly the same as those encountered before 1914, which makes the collective intelligence of the world lose its effectiveness. The most urgent task for politicians today is to find an effective intelligence to prevent war from happening again. If Britain wants to participate in collective security, then two conditions are essential:</p>
<p>The security system should be truly collective and powerful, sufficient to deter the ambition of any aggressor.</p>
<p>Britain's policy and military force to fulfill its full responsibility in this system should be fully powerful and determined.</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary continued, "We must clearly distinguish this policy from a policy of encirclement when we reiterate our support for the League of Nations and the collective security system. What the British government wants is to fulfill its responsibilities in the collective security system, not to participate in encirclement operations. Military expenditure must now be greatly increased. This is something to regret, but there is comfort in this plan, because reorganizing military preparations to consolidate the collective security system is the cheapest way to reorganize military preparations."</p>
<p>Reasons for Strengthening Military Preparations</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary concluded by saying that now, because of the lack of trust in the goodwill of various countries, and because terror is coming from all sides, we really have to reorganize our military preparations. Gradually strengthening the collective security system is the only way to eliminate the terror of unwarranted aggression. It must wait until all countries know that, no matter what, aggression does not pay off, and then it will be over. Labor Party leader Mr. Attlee expressed great disappointment with the Foreign Secretary's speech, saying that the government's indecision on the League of Nations issue cannot give the country a unified direction. The case of Britain's increase in military preparations will be brought up, and the required military preparations are only for the League of Nations. The Labor Party is unwilling to support the increase in military preparations, and the policies of imperialism and alliance.</p>
<p>Italy's Trade Decreases Sharply</p>
<p>Mr. Cranborne finally concluded the debate, saying that sanctions are now gradually taking effect, and Italy's export trade has been greatly hit. Britain's actions in the Mediterranean are purely defensive. Since Britain has taken on collective security, Britain's words and deeds are consistent, which is the greatest guarantee on which peace can rely. He continued, saying that the whole world is now feeling uneasy, and Britain is the mainstay. We should make this mainstay strong and stable. The reason for Britain's reconsideration of military preparations lies in this. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<h3>Eden's Speech Disappoints Various Parties Because It Is Vague</h3>
<p>London – British Foreign Secretary Mr. Eden's speech in the House of Commons last night disappointed the newspapers of the Labor Party and the Liberal Party, criticizing his remarks as vague. The Conservative Party also believed that Mr. Eden's remarks had no novelty, but approved of his firm statement that Britain abides by the collective security system, and his common sense in dealing with the sanctions issue. The Times said that Mr. Eden's remarks had the full agreement of the cabinet, and that the main point was nothing more than that Britain must re-establish military preparations in order to promote disarmament. If the oil embargo asks for help from the United States, it will provoke the resentment of the majority of the American people, and regard it as the League of Nations wanting to add responsibilities that it does not want to the United States. The Daily Mail and the Daily Express still hold an attitude of opposition to the collective security system, but the Morning Post said that Mr. Eden's remarks did not indicate that the British government wanted to take the lead in imposing new sanctions on Italy. This is gratifying. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>London – When the House of Commons discussed the government's current foreign policy yesterday, Foreign Secretary Eden gave a long speech. Parliamentarians are now commenting on it, believing that the most noteworthy point is the proposal made regarding the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, that is, firmly advocating continuing negotiations and mediation to find a satisfactory solution. As for the general impression, it is that the uneasiness felt by the members of the House of Commons regarding the current situation in Europe has not been removed, and the government's position has not been seen to have strengthened. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Personnel are Gratified that the Collective Security System Depends on Britain's Attitude</h3>
<p>Geneva – After British Foreign Secretary Mr. Eden gave a speech in the British House of Commons yesterday, League of Nations personnel have been commenting on it, believing that Mr. Eden has expressed opposition to the proposal to revise the League of Nations Covenant, and therefore a certain country's proposal to revise the Covenant must be postponed for discussion. They also believe that Foreign Secretary Eden's speech was not very clear on the Abyssinian issue, and the reason for this is that the 18-nation subcommittee of the League of Nations General Assembly is about to meet, and it is appropriate to be cautious in handling matters. As for the entire speech, it still expresses approval of the collective security system. This is particularly gratifying. In short, the collective security organization that European countries can complete according to the various principles of the League of Nations Covenant can be successful. The main factor depends on Britain's attitude towards the League of Nations. In addition, the attitude that Britain should take when the 18-nation subcommittee meets can also be seen from the principles mentioned by Foreign Secretary Eden in his speech. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>Geneva – After the League of Nations members read British Foreign Secretary Mr. Eden's speech in the House of Commons, they all believed that Britain's concern for Germany's rearmament far exceeded its concern for the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. This was also the focus of the previous Hoare-Laval plan, which was to shift Italy's intentions and rebuild the Stresa Front against Germany. Mr. Eden's resolution to give a speech today can be said to be a rehash of old matters. Although this is quite alarming to the League of Nations representatives here, Mr. Eden still emphasized the point of collective peace, which has been able to dispel the concerns of people here that Britain is about to strike the League of Nations' policy towards Italy. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>
<h3>Paris is Deeply Impressed, Believing that it Does Not Conflict with French Policy</h3>
<p>Paris – British Foreign Secretary Mr. Eden's speech in the House of Commons, firmly declaring that Britain's sanctions policy against Italy will continue unchanged, has aroused a deep impression in all circles in Paris. Everyone believes that the policy taken by the British government does not conflict with the attitude taken by the French government. The attitude of the French government is that France will give full support to any collective action passed by the League of Nations' Executive Council, but France will not initiate anything in this matter. Mr. Eden's statement that Britain now needs to reorganize its military preparations for the sake of collective security is also sincerely welcomed by all parties in France. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<h3>Italian Authorities Observe that Tightening Sanctions is Enough to Increase Britain's Responsibility</h3>
<p>Rome – After British Foreign Secretary Mr. Eden's speech in the British House of Commons yesterday was transmitted here, responsible parties declared that, based on Foreign Secretary Eden's speech, it can be known that if the move to tighten sanctions against Italy is indeed implemented, then the responsibility borne by Britain will be increased. Britain has already seen this. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Passes Additional Military Expenditure; Navy Department Proposes Ship-Building Plan</h3>
<p>London – The House of Commons held a closed-door meeting today to discuss national defense issues. The Navy Department will propose a naval shipbuilding plan.

<p>Birmingham – Former British Foreign Secretary Mr. Austen Chamberlain gave a speech here today, saying that there is absolutely no reason to be surprised by the United States' expansion of military preparations, and Britain will never go to war with the United States, but since the eagerness to prepare for war has spread throughout Europe, and even Switzerland and the Netherlands are caught up in the whirlpool, and the suspicion and apprehension of all parties are so great, then Britain should not lag behind alone.

<h3>Franco-Russian Treaty; French Congress Still Discussing; Foreign Minister Declares to Explain to the Cabinet</h3>
<p>Paris – According to what this agency's parliamentary correspondent knows, regarding the Franco-Russian mutual assistance agreement, the Chamber of Deputies will not be able to complete discussions before Thursday. Many deputies are still scheduled to speak and express their opinions. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>Paris – The Chamber of Deputies is scheduled to vote on the ratification of the Franco-Russian mutual assistance treaty tomorrow. Foreign Minister Mr. Flandin will personally attend and give a speech. This afternoon, the cabinet held a meeting, and Mr. Flandin will explain the main points of the speech he intends to read tomorrow. After the cabinet meeting, Mr. Flandin met with Soviet Ambassador Mr. Potemkin. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>Moscow – The Zhenli Bao's Paris correspondent held talks with Mr. Penko, the Minister of the French League of Nations. Mr. Penko described the Franco-Soviet pact, saying, "The great line I initiated is now being realized. The parliament will ratify this pact, which is already self-evident. The great significance of this pact for France and the peace line has been said by Mr. Doumergue tomorrow. The Franco-Soviet pact is a weapon to consolidate peace, and therefore can strengthen the League of Nations and consolidate the relationship between countries that desire peace. This pact includes the huge political power of the Soviet collective security system. France and the Soviet Union are the two geographical poles of the European continent, and now they have strengthened their friendship to consolidate peace policy." (Tass, 25th)</p>
<h3>Italy and Abyssinia Peace Treaty; Someone Proposes New Plan; Based on League of Nations Covenant and Treaty; Relevant Authorities are Studying</h3>
<p>London – Regarding the issue of peace between Italy and Abyssinia, a new plan has recently been proposed, and relevant countries are studying it. The general public believes that Italy is extremely willing to consider this plan. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has also sent personnel to Abyssinia in a private capacity to begin contact with the Abyssinian Emperor, so that if the negotiations fail, Italy can still acknowledge it. According to the main principles of this new plan, the 1906 treaty between Britain, France, and Italy on Abyssinia and the obligations stipulated in the League of Nations Covenant are to be integrated in order to satisfy the wishes of all parties. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>The Italian-Abyssinian dispute should be resolved within the scope of the League of Nations. Some parts of Abyssinian territory may be ceded to Italy, and Italy should pay compensation. Abyssinian mineral resources may be exploited using foreign capital and technology, and part of the surplus profits should be allocated to Abyssinia. All of the Amharic region, that is, the main part of Abyssinia, its sovereignty is still owned by the Abyssinian Emperor.</p>
<p>Regarding the second point, the land that Italy can obtain is: A. the northern regions of Biru and Drou (the land previously conquered by Abyssinia, bordering Italian Eritrea); B. the southern provinces of Wogaidan, Bolan, and Sidamo, bordering British Somaliland or British Kenya. However, Italy should compensate Abyssinia with money. This new plan also advocates that Abyssinia cede the eastern Wossa region, that is, the land through which the Djibouti-Abyssinia Railway passes, to France, and cede the Kunlin-British-Ethiopian Sultanate to Britain. Britain and France should also compensate Abyssinia with money. Finally, it is also advocated that the Abyssinian government should issue a public debt under the management of the League of Nations, and the fund should be filled with mineral surpluses, and the League of Nations should keep it in custody on behalf of the government. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>Brussels – A semi-official Belgian communications agency correspondent in London recently declared that, according to well-informed sources, the special envoy sent by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and personnel from the Italian Embassy in Britain are currently attempting to begin negotiations with the British government in order to seek a solution to the Italian-Abyssinian dispute based on the principles published by British General Corwin in various newspapers. General Corwin's principles include six items: The administrative power of the non-Amharic region of Abyssinia should be ceded to Britain, Italy, and France, and each country should compensate them with money. This money should be handed over to the League of Nations for issuing Abyssinia's public debt to pay interest. This public debt should be used to develop Abyssinia's economy. Most of the non-Amharic region should be ceded to Italy. Its area is equal to the "colonial zone" that British Foreign Secretary Hoare and French Prime Minister Laval advocated that Abyssinia should be划归 to Italy when they proposed a peace plan last December, so as to match the Italian territory's boundary line. The non-Amharic region and the British and French territories should be connected, and should be ceded to Britain and France. Abyssinia's sovereignty and its security should be guaranteed by the League of Nations. After the mineral products in the non-Amharic region are exploited by other countries, a portion of the surplus profits should be allocated to Abyssinia. (Havas Agency, 25th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations 18-Nation Committee to Convene on the Second of Next Month to Discuss Tightening Sanctions Against Italy; Frequent Diplomatic Contacts between France and Italy</h3>
<p>Rome – The League of Nations General Assembly's 18-Nation Subcommittee is scheduled to meet on the second of next month to discuss the issue of tightening sanctions against Italy. It is rumored that the Italian government will issue an order on that day for warships across the country to fire up their engines in preparation for deployment. This news has recently been acknowledged by officials. (Havas Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>Paris – Foreign Minister Flandin recently met with Italian Ambassador Cerutti. The general public believes that this move must be related to the issue of banning coal and oil. They also believe that when the League of Nations' General Assembly's 18-Nation Subcommittee discusses this issue on the second of next month, the French government will definitely take a passive attitude, that is, the French government is unwilling to evade the measures that the committee can decide, but it is also unwilling to initiate any actions that would make the international situation increasingly tense. On the semi-official side, it is also said that since France is neither a crude oil producing country nor a large-scale sales country, the influence it can have on this issue is naturally limited. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>Rome – After Prime Minister Mussolini held talks with German Ambassador Hassel and Polish Ambassador Vesaki, French Foreign Minister Flandin immediately met with Italian Ambassador to France Cerutti. French Ambassador to Italy Chamberlin also contacted Italian Foreign Minister Mr. Suvich. Political figures here have been commenting on it, believing that if the League of Nations' General Assembly's 18-Nation Subcommittee decides to tighten sanctions against Italy when it meets on the second of next month, then there is a possibility that Italy and Germany will cooperate in practice. Although Italy has no intention of abandoning the Locarno Pact, the Stresa Front, and the Franco-Italian Rome Agreement at present, if the League of Nations tightens sanctions, Italy may change its current policy and take Germany's position on major international issues. Political figures here believe that although France's attitude towards Italy can still be said to be returning to good, at present there is still no hope that Britain's policy towards Italy will change. In addition, after the recent successive victories of the expeditionary force led by General Badoglio on the northern road of Abyssinia, people here believe that the Abyssinian army will eventually have a major defeat, and Abyssinian territory will definitely be dismembered. Therefore, British Foreign Secretary Eden's speech in the British House of Commons yesterday, which advocated seeking a solution to the Italian-Abyssinian dispute based on the recommendations made by the League of Nations' Executive Council's Five-Nation Special Committee in September of last year, has no room for acceptance in Italy. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>Rome – Foreign Minister Mr. Suvich received French Ambassador to Italy Chamberlin this afternoon. It is heard that what the two discussed was related to the League of Nations' General Assembly's 18-Nation Subcommittee meeting on March 2nd to discuss tightening sanctions against Italy. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<h3>Naval Mutual Assistance Issue: Italy Protests to Britain Again, Maintaining Original Position</h3>
<p>Rome: Regarding the issue of naval mutual assistance among Mediterranean coastal nations, Italy previously lodged a protest with Britain, which was rejected. Italian Ambassador to Britain, Grandi, submitted a note to the British Foreign Office this morning, stating that the Italian government maintains its original position on this matter and that "the Italian government reserves the right to re-discuss this issue at an appropriate time." (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>London: According to reliable sources in political circles, the British government, as the tense situation in the Mediterranean has passed, will gradually withdraw its fleets stationed there. The aircraft carrier "Courageous" and battleship "Renown" have already been recalled from the Mediterranean to Britain for docking and repairs, which are expected to take several months. This indicates that the British cabinet believes that naval conflicts are unlikely to occur in the Mediterranean. As for the Red Sea, most of the warships originally stationed there from the Far East Fleet, namely four cruisers and all submarines, have also been recalled to Hong Kong. Furthermore, two of the four submarines originally stationed in Aden have been transferred to Port Said in Egypt, and the remaining two have been dispatched to Bombay. This clearly shows that the British cabinet has abandoned its plan to blockade the Red Sea. However, officials are currently keeping these facts secret, fearing that public opinion, seeing the situation in the Mediterranean has eased, would no longer enthusiastically support the government's rearmament plan.

<h3>Military Conference Held at Palazzo Venezia in Italy; Crown Prince Umberto Also Present</h3>
<p>Rome: At 4 PM today, Prime Minister Mussolini convened a military conference at Palazzo Venezia. Crown Prince Umberto was also in attendance. (Ginwas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Athens: Although the atmosphere in the Mediterranean has eased slightly, Italy's defense work on the islands of the Dodecanese is becoming increasingly tense. According to reports from here, the strategically important island of Leros has a garrison of 18,000 troops. The island has no contact with the outside world, and the island's residents have been relocated to Rhodes or sent back to Italy. There are six destroyers and ten other major warships anchored in the port, all under the command of Admiral Barcelli. On the island of Corfu, all armaments and heavy artillery, except those defending Mount Ilias, have been transferred to Leros. (Guomin dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Difficulties in Italian-German Rapprochement; Hitler and Mussolini Have Divergent Views</h3>
<p>Paris: A correspondent for Le Matin in Rome recently stated that after repeated talks between Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and German Ambassador Hassell, both sides believe that active cooperation between Italy and Germany under the current circumstances is not opportune. German Führer Hitler raised several questions regarding Italy's current commercial and military policies, instructing Hassell to inquire about Mussolini's views. Mussolini's answers were not concrete, as Italy's commerce and military have been in a special situation since conducting the war against Abyssinia and resisting international sanctions. Regarding the issue of the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance pact, Mussolini and Hassell reached a consensus, but both sides failed to agree on whether the obligations stipulated in the Locarno Treaties could be altered due to this agreement. It is generally believed that Mussolini and Hassell will continue consultations in the near future, but the date has not yet been announced. In short, after the recent talks between Italy and Germany, although a better understanding has been achieved, no practical progress has been made. What is known is that the Italian government is currently most concerned with promoting closer ties between Italy and Germany. (Ginwas dispatch, 25th)</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Celebrates Red Army Anniversary; Far East Commander Encourages Troops to Defend Against Aggression and Defend National Territory</h3>
<p>Khabarovsk: General Blucher, Commander of the Far East Red Army, issued an order to the Special Far East Red Army on the 18th anniversary of the Red Army, stating, "The Red Army is a powerful force guarding the Soviet border, protecting the happy and prosperous lives of workers and peasants. The Soviet government firmly implements a policy of peace, but the world's imperialist fascist aggressors from both East and West continue to wield their sharp knives against our homeland of the world's workers. In 1929, China's White generals, instigated by world imperialists, attempted to test the Soviet Union's power, but were ultimately defeated. However, this still has not satisfied the enemy. Today, the crisis of military attacks on the Far Eastern border is becoming increasingly urgent. The Far East Red Army must be prepared at all times." (Tass dispatch, 25th)</p>

<h3>British MP Questions Student Demonstrations in Shanghai International Settlement; Eden Says He Has Not Yet Received Report</h3>
<p>London: During a meeting of the House of Commons today, Communist MP Gallacher questioned Foreign Secretary Eden about the clashes between students and police in the Shanghai International Settlement during demonstrations held on December 24th of last year against the so-called autonomous movement in North China. He asked how many students were injured, how many were arrested, how many of the injured students were under the age of sixteen, and whether the British-controlled police had the right to suppress demonstrations by ordinary Chinese people protesting against Japan's policy towards China. Foreign Secretary Eden replied that the British government had instructed local British officials to submit a report, but no reply had been received yet. He added that the local police were controlled by the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement, which is an international body composed of fourteen members, five of whom are British, five Chinese, two American, and two Japanese.

<h3>Ice Flowing Slightly Outside Dagukou; Aircraft Rescue Plan Formulated; Icebreaker Carries Coal and Food for Relief; Zhengji Company Suffers Huge Losses</h3>
<p>Tianjin: On the 25th, the wind direction at Dagukou still turned to the northwest, and the situation was slightly better. Zhengji Company's Anli wheel, due to the flowing and partially melting ice between Tanggu and Dagu, risked leaving Tanggu for Shanghai at 5:00 AM and arrived at Sally Di Island outside the port in the afternoon. Jin Navigation Company's Changan wheel, which had been trapped outside the port for half a month and was short of water, entered the port through the ice early on the 25th and arrived at Sally Di Island in the afternoon. The two ships telegraphed the Tianjin shipping industry one after another, reporting that the ice outside the port was loosening, but because the wind was not strong, the flow was very small. If the weather is warm tomorrow and the day after, the ships trapped by the ice can gradually escape. Jin Navigation Company's Yongting wheel telegraphed Tianjin on the 25th that the ship was blown by the wind to the beach outside Dagukou on the night of the 24th, and the wings and rudder were broken and could not move. It was extremely dangerous and requested rapid rescue. The navigation company sent the Tianxing icebreaker early on the 25th, carrying a large amount of coal, water, and food, to rescue the ship outside the port and to provide coal and food to the Gan Zhou, Shun Li, and other ships in distress near Heigu. It did not return at night. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Tianjin: The ice in Qinhuangdao is severely frozen, and the number of Chinese and foreign passenger and cargo ships trapped inside and outside the port has reached sixteen. The Xin Taiping and Jilin ships are frozen outside the port, and coal and food have run out. Repeated telegrams for assistance have gone unanswered. Goods on the docks are piling up because they cannot be transported. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Tianjin: The Ministry of Communications telegraphed the Tianjin Maritime Affairs Bureau that the usual fee for Eurasian aircraft is 800 yuan per hour, but in order to rescue the ships trapped by ice, which is a charitable act, it is allowed to be reduced to 200 yuan, nominally for gasoline costs. The Douglas aircraft, which was originally scheduled to come to Tianjin at 12:30 PM on the 25th, changed to 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM on the 26th due to cloudy weather. The municipal government dispatched Liu Dongxuan to assist Maritime Affairs Bureau Director Pan Yaoxiang in taking care of the aircraft at that time.

<h3>Hankou Customs Brokerage Asks for the Cancellation of the Six-Wheel Bureau's Notary Office</h3>
<p>Hankou - Recently, the six shipping companies of Hankou - China Merchants, Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Sanbei, Jijiang, and Nisshin - have jointly organized a notary office for the export of goods. All export goods must be measured and weighed with the skin by the notary office. However, the customs brokerage industry is quite opposed to this, because in the export goods, such as pickled vegetables transported from the upper reaches, they are all packed in earthen jars. The weight of each earthen jar ranges from seven catties to twenty-five catties. If they are weighed with the skin, the merchants will be unable to bear it. In the future, goods from the upper reaches will inevitably be directly transported to Shanghai, and the customs brokerage industry in Hankou will be greatly affected. Therefore, they have sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce requesting that it forward a letter to the six companies to quickly cancel the notary office.

<h3>Japan Expresses Deliberation on the Eastern Hebei Puppet Organization. Tada Freely Discusses Issues in Hebei and Chahar in Peiping. Chen Zhongfu and Doihara Continue to Exchange Opinions.</h3>
<p>Peiping Correspondence: Regarding the Eastern Hebei incident, after nearly a week of consultations, it is heard that the Japanese side has indicated that the issue of abolishing the puppet organization can be considered in the long term. At the same time, the Japanese side has made some claims regarding the original name of "Demilitarized Zone" after the abolition of the Eastern Hebei puppet organization. After negotiation, it was agreed to leave it for the second step of consultation. Doihara was scheduled to visit Song Zheyuan on the morning of the 24th for consultations.</p>
<p>Tada Hayao, commander of the Japanese garrison in Tianjin, spoke to reporters at the Fushang Hall on the 23rd regarding various issues in Hebei and Chahar. According to him, "I very much hope that the 'merger' of the Eastern Hebei Autonomous Government and the Hebei-Chahar Political Council will be realized. However, there is a difference between the two sides, namely that the Eastern Hebei Autonomous Government is touted as being anti-communist, while the establishment of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council is a lifeline with the Nanjing government, so their purposes are slightly different. They can only merge if the two sides reach the same level. Chairman Song is currently working hard on reform, striving for the happiness of the people. If the reform is successful in the future, the merger with the Eastern Hebei organization will naturally be easy. Regarding the Zhangbei incident, our army has not interfered much. The Japanese Kwantung Army negotiated with the chairman of Chahar Province, and the Chahar side has agreed to allow Li Shouxin's Security Brigade to be stationed there. Therefore, the details of the agreement between the Japanese Kwantung Army stationed in Chahar and the Chahar side are not known because they are not within the scope of the jurisdiction of the Japanese garrison in Tianjin. In short, the Japanese side has absolutely no intention of occupying it, and even less of merging the Eastern Hebei and Chahar areas into Manchukuo. This is what I, as the commander, can assert. I hope that your country, from top to bottom, will deeply believe in this intention. It should be known that Sino-Japanese friendship is by no means just lip service, let alone empty talk. What is painful is that Sino-Japanese relations are worse after the Russo-Japanese War than before the Russo-Japanese War. China and Japan should not only blame others, but should also blame themselves. The path to friendship should be initiated by both sides, and both sides have mutual responsibilities. If we want to improve relations, both sides have responsibilities to bear. China and Japan should abandon the concept of being right ourselves and wronging others and seek mutual understanding. Future relations should seek new paths. I think the Communist Party is like a flood and a beast. One wrong step will lead to eternal regret. Doihara, the chief of the special agency of the Japanese Kwantung Army stationed in Panjin, does not have the mission of conducting Sino-Japanese negotiations with the Peiping authorities. I have not yet received a report on the increase of Japanese troops stationed in North China, and I have only seen it in the newspaper. I have no trip to Zhangjiakou. I took a plane to browse the Ping-Sui line before, but only looked down at Datong from the plane. In fact, I did not go to Datong. Bailingmiao is far away in Mongolia and has some relationship with the Japanese Kwantung Army. I have not been there recently. Our country has a very deep misunderstanding with your country, and I would like to talk to you about this. My impression of coming to Peiping this time is that Sino-Japanese relations have improved. For example, the anti-Japanese movement has calmed down on the surface, but the lives of the common people are worse than in the seventh and eighth years of the Republic of China. The commercial depression has intensified. As for the Hebei-Chahar Political Council and the various committees under it, the matter of hiring Japanese people to serve as technical consultants was entrusted by Chairman Song. At this time, I have introduced them to the Japanese side on behalf of him, but I have not yet received a reply. Furthermore, there is no response to the number of consultants and their future tasks." etc.</p>
<p>Regarding the solution of various issues in Hebei and Chahar, after the Japanese side put forward concrete opinions, the parties concerned have been carefully considering methods for days. Chen Zhongfu, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, visited Doihara at the Fushang Hall at 10:00 AM on the 22nd to exchange views. Tada, commander of the Japanese garrison in Tianjin, was also present. They talked for half an hour before Chen left. That afternoon, at 5:15 PM, Chen took the Beining Railway train to Tianjin to discuss everything with Tianjin Mayor Xiao Zhenying. The Foreign Affairs Committee is scheduled to hold a meeting at the end of this month. Due to the Japanese side's opinion, it is hoped that after the newly appointed Japanese Ambassador to China, Arita, takes office, before the Nanjing meeting is held, the Hebei-Chahar issue will come to an end. Doihara also plans to leave Peiping in the middle of next month and return to Changchun for a trip. As for all the issues in Eastern Hebei and Northern Chahar, whether they can be resolved as we hope, or whether they will maintain the status quo, there should be a factual demonstration within the next two weeks. In addition, Yagami Toshiyasu, chief of staff of the Japanese garrison in Tianjin, visited Song Zheyuan at Wuyiku Hutong at 11:00 AM on the 22nd. After talking for half an hour, he left and returned to Tianjin at 1:00 PM that afternoon. (23rd)</p>
<h3>Gansu Provincial Government: Afforestation Plan Along the Yellow River: Afforestation along the Yellow River is a vital policy for the Northwest; the provincial government plans a five-year implementation plan.</h3>
<p>Lanzhou Dispatch: The provincial government considers the security of the Yellow River through afforestation to be a crucial current policy. It instructed the Department of Construction to formulate an implementation plan, which the department drafted and submitted to the provincial government for referral to the Ministry of Industries for review. The original draft plan is outlined below:</p>
<p>General Overview of the Yellow River Basin</p>
<p>The largest tributaries of the Yellow River in this province are the Wei River and the Tao River. Afforestation along the riverbanks can be carried out in cooperation with the Forestry Bureau of Shaanxi Province in the future. The source of the Tao River has rich natural forests, so the Tao River carries very little sediment. In the future, this province should plan to increase afforestation and protect the natural forests in the Tao and Min areas. Speaking of the Yellow River itself, the Yellow River in Gansu Province passes through six counties, including Linxia, Yongjing, , Yuzhong, Jingyuan, and Jingtai. It is not yet possible to determine how much land is suitable for afforestation along the riverbanks in each of these counties because no on-site surveys have been conducted. The areas suitable for afforestation reported by each county are listed below: Yuzhong has 1,580 mu of land suitable for afforestation along the riverbanks; Jingyuan has 2,800 mu of land suitable for afforestation along the riverbanks; the riverbank in this Lan area is 110 li long (no report of the number of mu suitable for afforestation); the riverbank in Yongjing is 45 li long (no report of the number of mu suitable for afforestation); the riverbank in Linxia is 10 li long, mostly rocky cliffs, not suitable for planting trees. The mu numbers reported by the above counties are accurate. A detailed survey is still necessary when afforestation is carried out in the future. The riverbank in Gaolan County is more than 110 li long, and the land suitable for afforestation should not be small. Therefore, this plan cannot specify the afforestation locations, but only divides the time and location to serve as the work procedure.</p>
<p>Measures for Implementing Afforestation</p>
<p>After years of natural disasters and man-made calamities in this province, financial difficulties have reached their peak. There is no special organization for afforestation, and there are no dedicated funds for afforestation expenses. Although there were various forestry plans in the past, they were not implemented due to insufficient financial resources. Therefore, this plan must narrow the scope, focusing only on the banks of the main Yellow River basin to ensure it is realistic. Appoint a specialist to guide the implementation of the work. Establishing a specialized agency would be costly and would slow down progress. It is planned that the Department of Construction will select one specialist who is proficient in both forestry and water conservancy to be responsible for managing the Yellow River and afforestation matters. This year, he will be sent to various places along the Yellow River to conduct an on-site survey, formulate an afforestation plan, and submit it to the provincial government for approval and implementation. Then, the specialist will guide the implementation. To promote the implementation of afforestation, the Yellow River basin in this province starts from the border between Gansu and Qinghai and extends eastward to the border with Ningxia. The river meanders for about 900 li. It is impossible to carry out afforestation at the same time, and there is no way to obtain a large number of saplings. It is planned to divide the main Yellow River into three sections: from Jishi Pass to Hekou as one section, from Hekou to Jingyuan as one section, and from Jingyuan to (Fosi Temple) as one section. Each section will have a Yellow River Afforestation Office, named after the location. For example, the Hekou section will be named the Yellow River Hekou Section Office, and so on. Each section will have one technician and two forest workers to handle afforestation matters within that section according to the plan. The completion period is set at five years. The annual business operations will be detailed in the next section. The main tasks of each afforestation office are that the climate in this province is dry, and it often does not rain for two or three months in spring and summer, which is not suitable for afforestation. Although the soil near the river is moist, it can still be used for some cutting afforestation, but the rest still needs to be planted with trees. Starting with cultivating seedlings, the main task of the thorn-growing office is to implement a portion of cutting afforestation every year and cultivate a suitable amount of seedlings to prepare for planting trees in the third year. The business allocation: Before the afforestation implementation plan is determined, this plan is intended to be easy to explain and a number is temporarily set as a rough estimate. Each section is 300 li long, and both banks are 600 li. It is tentatively set to plant 10 mu of trees per li, and each section should plant 6,000 mu of trees. If five years are used as the completion period, an average of 1,200 mu must be afforested each year. The funds for this plan are in accordance with the original plan of the Ministry of Industry for afforestation along the Yellow River. There is already an amount of 24,000 yuan. If one mu of afforestation costs 20 yuan according to the local conditions in this province, only 1,200 mu can be afforested. In order to use the people's service, the leveling, irrigation, and cuttings are all done by the public providing labor and giving subsidies. The technicians will work with the local county government and local Baojia to coordinate the implementation. All the planted forests will be handed over to the local county government for safekeeping as security forests after planting. All expenses can be saved. It is estimated that 65,706 yuan of afforestation expenses will be required in five years. In addition to the 24,000 yuan, there is still a shortfall of 41,706 yuan. Therefore, if the amount is insufficient after two years, the provincial government will need to continue to raise funds to support it. The detailed method of requisitioning labor will be submitted for approval during implementation.</p>
<p>Work Progress Steps</p>
<p>The progress of this Yellow River afforestation work is scheduled for five years, from 1936 to 1940. In the first year, willows and poplars will be planted on both sides of the Yellow River. The distance between the two trees is about one zhang. There are 200 trees per mu, and each section afforests 400 mu. The three sections together account for 1,200 mu. In the same year, 7,200 mu will be afforested in 1938, with 240 trees per mu. In that year, each section should cultivate 576,000 seedlings, and the three sections should prepare a total of 1,728,000 seedlings. In the second year, the three sections together will carry out cutting afforestation on 1,200 mu, but the 1,728,000 seedlings cultivated in the previous year should be transplanted to other places for the purpose of preparing for afforestation of 2,400 mu in 1939. In that year, each section should cultivate 192,000 seedlings, and the three sections should cultivate a total of 576,000 seedlings. In the third year, the three sections together will carry out cutting afforestation on 1,200 mu. Because the 1,728,000 seedlings cultivated in the first year have grown, each section should plant 2,400 mu of trees according to the previous plan, and the three sections should afforest a total of 7,200 mu to prepare for afforestation in 1939. Each section should transplant 572,000 old seedlings, and the three sections should transplant a total of 1,728,000 seedlings. Also, to prepare for afforestation of 2,400 mu in 1940, each section should cultivate 192,000 seedlings, and the three sections should cultivate a total of 576,000 seedlings. In the fourth year, the three sections together will carry out cutting afforestation on 1,200 mu and plant trees on 2,400 mu, but the seedlings cultivated in the previous year are easy to grow. Each section should transplant 192,000 old seedlings, and the three sections should transplant a total of 576,000 seedlings. In the fifth year, the three sections together will carry out cutting afforestation on 1,200 mu and plant trees on 2,400 mu. The total afforestation area within five years is 18,000 mu, with 4,080,000 trees.</p>

<h3>Pinghan Railway Bureau: Construction of the Xuyu Branch Line: Surveying Work Nearing Completion</h3>
<p>Kaifeng Dispatch: The proposal to build a railway between Xuchang and Yuxian in Henan Province has been around for a long time. In 1933, the gentry and merchants of Xuchang and Yu counties formed a preparatory committee and hired engineers to start surveying the route and drawing up charts, gradually making it concrete. However, it was abandoned due to the economic depression in Xuchang and Yu and the bankruptcy of the rural areas, making it difficult to raise shares. This year, the Pinghan Railway Bureau was ordered by the Ministry to build the Xuyu branch line and sent Tan Zhendong, deputy chief of the bureau's engineering section, to lead more than ten employees to carry out surveying. It is reported that Tan and others departed from Xuchang more than ten days ago and the work along the way has been very smooth. Bridges and culverts have been surveyed and completed. They have now arrived in Yuxian to survey and map the South Gate Station, the end point of the road. It is planned to be at the Zhongfeng Coal Mine in Majiadong in the Seventh District of Yuxian. The entire line will have four stations: Xuchang, Quandian, Yuxian, and Majiadong. In the future, if needed, small stations may be added in Lingjing and Quanhepup. (23rd)</p>
<h3>Datong: Robbery of the Bank of China's Agency: Loss of More Than 19,000 Gold Yuan</h3>
<p>Wuhu Dispatch: Datong Town, located between Wuhu and the province, is adjacent to the Yangtze River. Before the Wuhu-Tunxi Highway was opened to traffic, it was the gateway to Huizhou, Tongling, Qingyang, and Jiuhua Mountain. It is also one of the largest market towns in Anhui Province besides Wuhu. Therefore, the Bank of China in Wuhu specially established an office in the town's Lifeng Money Shop, called the Bank of China Datong Agency, to balance the daily business income, which was also very large. Unexpectedly, Wuhu just received a telegram that the Datong Agency was processing the day's business statistics at 7:30 p.m. on the 23rd when five or six bandits suddenly broke into the shop, holding weapons and driving the staff into a corner. Four bandits went to the office and forced the agency's manager, Zhou Xueqin, to hand over the key to the iron cabinet and immediately shot Zhou in the head. Zhou immediately fainted. The bandits then shot another employee, seized the key, opened the iron cabinet, and robbed a total of more than 19,000 yuan in legal tender, which they put into a rattan suitcase they had brought with them. Then they gathered to the back and When a bandit on the outside lookout shouted "Good" (meaning the predetermined password), the five bandits and others grabbed the and rushed out the door. The whole process did not take five or six minutes, and their actions were very agile. At that time, all the employees saw Manager Zhou being shot by the bandits and were almost frightened out of their wits. They didn't know where the bandits had fled. Zhou slightly regained consciousness, and the employees dared to divide and rush to report to the local Public Security Bureau and the Third District Office. Zhou also struggled to get up, pressed his hand on the wound, and ran painfully to the Public Security Bureau to briefly report the truth of the robbery at that time. Upon receiving the report, the police station immediately dispatched all the police and militia teams to pursue the bandits. The Hai'e torpedo boat of the Navy, which was stationed on the Datong River, also announced a river ban and hired two Anwu small ferries to sail to Meigeng upstream and Henggang downstream to search for the bandits. However, the bandits had already escaped without a trace with the stolen goods. Manager Zhou suffered serious injuries to his head and has been hospitalized for treatment. The Wuhu branch of the Bank of China specially sent Deputy Director Nan to Tong on the morning of the 24th to investigate the incident. (24th)</p>
<h3>Overview of Nanjing's Firefighting Services: Fire Brigades and Firefighting Associations Complement Each Other; Automatic Telephones are Detrimental to Transmitting Alarms; There are Nineteen Firefighting Organizations in the City</h3>
<p>Nanjing Dispatch: Since Nanjing became the capital, the population has been increasing day by day. In 1927, the city had only more than 360,000 people. Recently, according to the Police Department, it has reached more than one million, almost tripling. Whether the firefighting strength of the city is in direct proportion to the increase in population is a question. Here is a brief survey of its outline.</p>
<p>Generally, firefighting organizations can be divided into two categories: regular firefighters and volunteer firefighters. The so-called regular firefighters are paid, while volunteer firefighters are unpaid. In other words, regular firefighters are a fixed organization and receive a certain amount of remuneration. Volunteer firefighters are temporarily assembled only after an incident occurs, and return to their original positions afterward without receiving any remuneration. As of now, there are a total of nineteen firefighting organizations in Nanjing, including six fire brigades and thirteen firefighting associations. The distribution is as follows: one fire brigade each in the East, South, North, Central, Xiaguan, and Pukou districts; three firefighting associations in the East District, one in the South District, three in the West District, two in the North District, three in the Central District, and one in the Xiaguan District.</p>
<p>Regarding the actual situation of Nanjing's firefighting organization, I had the honor of hearing the details from Wang Ji, captain of the Fire Police Brigade, and Xu Hanquan, the gentleman from the First Firefighting Association in the East District. First, let me describe Nanjing's regular firefighters. According to Wang, the fire brigade is under the jurisdiction of the Capital Police Department, so its source of funding is only a part of the police administrative expenses. Until now, there has been no specific funding. Therefore, the rise and fall of firefighting organizations often depends on whether the past principals attach importance to this kind of undertaking as the standard. Director Wang (Gu Pan) has not been in office for long and there have been no changes. During Director Chen (Zhuo)'s tenure, he made every effort to reorganize. At that time, there were a total of eighteen fire police teams. Later, six teams were cut, and the savings were used to add firefighting equipment. The new fire engines have been increased to six. At this time, the funding has not increased, but the firefighting strength has increased a lot.</p>
<p>Also, since the adoption of automatic telephones, the general public naturally feels convenient, but from the perspective of firefighting, it is a huge loss. During the period when magneto or common battery telephones were used, in the event of a fire alarm, all kinds of important calls had to be temporarily stopped and transmitted first. Now, the use of machine calls has lost its flexible function and has led to delays, because it is in units of fifty. Among these fifty, only ten can be connected at the same time. When we use the telephone, we often hear a busy tone, ("buzzing sound") the reason is that we have not yet obtained the opportunity to talk. Just imagine how can we suffer this kind of unexpected delay when a fire occurs? Regarding the remedy, after consulting with the telephone bureau, there is only one method of installing a dedicated line, but the cost is too high and it is practically impossible. Now, another telephone is installed in the team headquarters, specifically for external to internal calls. In this way, only one opportunity to talk has been reduced, and the effect is very limited.</p>
<p>There are two watchtowers in Nanjing: Chengnan is the Zhonghua Gate tower, and Chengbei is the Drum Tower tower. In addition, police stations in various places are also responsible for reporting. After the Firefighting Headquarters obtains the above information, it immediately dispatches the team on one side and transmits the news to various fire brigades and firefighting associations on the other side. As for civil notification, it can also be heavy at any time through the method of interrogation.</p>
<p>The First Firefighting Association in the East District is a business-run organization and is, needless to say, a volunteer firefighting organization. The association's expenses are donated by merchants, but the firefighters are paid salaries. At the same time, they also stay in the association all day long so that they can be dispatched at any time. In this way, it is essentially a regular firefighting organization. According to Xu, the association has a history of more than 100 years. During the Qing Dynasty, it was the Yongping Water Dragon Bureau. In 1929, it changed to a pump machine and was called the Yongping Firefighting Association. In April 1931, it was divided into the East District. In 1932, it accumulated funds to purchase a fire engine. This was the beginning of Nanjing's own modern fire engines. Up to now, the firefighting association has added nine vehicles, plus the six fire brigades. There are already fifteen vehicles in the city. In addition, there are gas cylinders (pumps), which are divided into towed, fixed, and mounted types. In addition to each of the nineteen firefighting organizations in the city having one, the Beilu Fire Brigade has two, for a total of twenty. The general number of firefighting equipment in the city is roughly as follows.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1929, a fire broke out in Zhangfuyuan in Chengnan during the day. Later, it spread to the Inner Bridge. The fire raged across the river, burning on both sides, and spread to the area of ​​Shengping Bridge, all the way to the former site of Shangyuan County Office, now the site of the Poor Children's Education Institute. A total of 200 households and shops were burned down. The fire started at lunchtime and was extinguished in the evening. After this major fire, the citizens of Nanjing almost changed color when talking about police, and were very vigilant, especially businessmen, who were more concerned. According to Xu, the strength of the fire brigade was limited at that time, and the association was still using the old-fashioned pump. It goes without saying that the other firefighting associations were even worse. In addition, the municipality was immature at the time and the streets were narrow. Every time a fire broke out, it often led to a major disaster. The merchants learned this lesson and unanimously and enthusiastically donated funds to purchase modern firefighting equipment. The First Firefighting Association in the East District purchased a modern gas cylinder under such circumstances. Since then, after several years of operation, the strength of firefighting in the city has reached today's state.</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Improvement of the Provincial Security Team</h3>
<p>In order to improve the security teams in the province, the Provincial Security Office has drafted an improvement outline, which has been approved for implementation. Regarding the security brigades stationed in various counties, the county magistrates who served concurrently as the brigade commanders will no longer serve concurrently from March onwards. The original major brigade adjutants will be reassigned as brigade commanders and will be under the jurisdiction of the district security commander. However, the county magistrates still have the power to command. Regarding the funding part, which was previously allocated by the county government under the county's funding items, the province has now directly issued a payment order to establish a district treasury. The security funds of each county will be allocated to the district treasury on a monthly basis for unified collection and expenditure. It is reported that the Mei-Jin plan is about to be implemented.</p>
<h3>Spring Cold Suddenly Snows</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of spring, it has been raining continuously, and the coldness has not diminished in the cold winter. The spring cold is bleak, and the spring is rarely felt. Unexpectedly, a strong wind suddenly broke out on the night of the 24th, and on the morning of the 25th at about 3:00 a.m., snow fell, followed by snow pellets. Spring crops were damaged, and farmers were worried.</p>
<h3>Villager Robbed, Old Mother Grieved</h3>
<p>Ma Tugen's family, the second household in the second Jia of the Erbao of Jingnantang Township in the Eighth District, is in a difficult situation. Unexpectedly, they were also coveted by bandits. At about 1:00 a.m. on the 22nd, eight robbers who spoke with a strong accent broke into the back window and wounded the householder's mother, Zhang, in the right corner of her forehead. The blood flowed like a pillar. They continued to rob, carrying and fleeing. The clothes and rice that were robbed were not reported afterward. Niu Wanqi, the patrol officer of the Ninth Substation, heard about it, and after personally conducting an on-site investigation, he reported to the county bureau requesting the arrest of the thieves.</p>
<h3>Water Patrol Team Cracks Down on Drug Trafficking</h3>
<p>The re-registration of opium smokers in this county has expired. A general inspection has been ordered to all districts and water and land public security agencies to ensure that there are no omissions. County Chief Li recently received a tip that there was drug trafficking in Huangqiao and other places in the county. He ordered Fei Gongxia, the captain of the water patrol team, to investigate. Captain Fei personally led the second patrol officer to Huangqiao, Qibao, Sijing, and other places, but found nothing. Yesterday, he went to Xinzhuang and found Li Huogen, Qian Ahu, and Zhang Guanming in an empty house at No. 1, Jia, Bao 1 in the Fourth, injecting morphine. They were all covered with needle scars and looked haggard. After strict interrogation, they confessed that Sheng Hongru's house, No. 10, Jia 4, Bao 7, was selling morphine. He immediately went to the address to arrest him and found four small packets of morphine, an injection needle, a small cup, and a scale on the bed. He immediately brought the witnesses back to Shen and sent them to the county government for legal action.</p>
<h3>Cangtai: Fengjiaqiao Qian's Residence Robbed</h3>
<p>Fengjiaqiao Town, which belongs to the county, is one of the small towns in the county. There are dozens of residents, and the Qian family is relatively wealthy, so they were coveted by bandits. In the late night of the 24th, more than 20 bandits suddenly came, each holding a weapon, broke open the gate, and robbed several families, including Qian Youpo, Qian Senmei, Qian Tianguan, and Qian Xidong. It is estimated that gold and silver jewelry, banknotes, and foreign money worth more than 5,000 yuan were robbed. Qian Youpo suffered the greatest loss. Afterward, the victim rushed to the Huangjing Public Security Substation to report. After receiving the report, the substation sent police to arrest the bandits, but the thieves had already fled far away.</p>
<h3>Jiading: Local Gentleman Zhu Xibai Passes Away</h3>
<p>Local gentleman Zhu Xibai (讳寿朋), was a Jinshi in the former Qing Dynasty. His morality and articles were valued by the world. Now, due to his advanced age and weakness, he suddenly developed asthma and died in his residence at No. 29, Gaomenlou, Nanjing, on the 19th of this month, at the age of 68. Zhu was honest and self-disciplined and could be a model for future generations. Yu Hongqi, a member of the Supervisory Yuan, and Ye Chucang, a member of the Central Committee, sent elegiac couplets to show their admiration.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: More Than One Inch of Snow Accumulates in Suzhou City</h3>
<p>In the past ten days in Suzhou, it has been raining continuously and the weather has been abnormally cold. This morning (25th), the climate suddenly changed and it felt even colder. At about 9:00, snow pellets were mixed in the drizzle. By noon, it was snowing heavily, and within two hours, the snow had accumulated to more than an inch. The city's business district has become even more depressed as a result. It is said that various entertainment venues such as the Beijing Theater and cinemas have been most affected, and their business has plummeted. Other small vendors are also complaining endlessly.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Resolves to Restore the Arbitration Office</h3>
<p>The Wuxian County Chamber of Commerce had an arbitration office during the era of the General Chamber of Commerce, which was dedicated to mediating commercial disputes. Later, it was abolished invisibly. Because the County Chamber of Commerce has seen that the commercial economy has been sluggish in recent years and that disputes have emerged one after another, once a lawsuit is involved, it often takes years to resolve. In order to avoid the suffering of merchants, the Executive Committee discussed and resolved to restore the Commercial Arbitration Committee yesterday. All organizations are in the process of being drafted. As for the various trade associations, they will also separately organize mediation committees so that if disputes cannot be resolved in the various trade associations, they will be sent to the arbitration association of the Chamber of Commerce for processing.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Zhizhang Farmers Robbed</h3>
<p>The Xiangqiao farmers and family in Zhizhang Township were suddenly robbed by twenty or thirty bandits the night before. In addition to two box guns, the weapons used by the bandits included bayonets, axes, etc. They bound the victims, including their wives and daughters, and poured cold water into their mouths and noses to force them to ask where the silver was hidden. As a result, the robbery lasted two hours before they howled and left. In addition to 200 yuan in cash and silver coins, there were also jewelry, clothes, etc., totaling about 1,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Continuing Spring Snow</h3>
<p>Since entering this year, there has been a lot of rain and snow here. Spring heat will affect the occurrence, and it has not cleared for nearly half a month, and the cold air has not diminished. On the morning of the 25th, the northeast wind was strong again, and it snowed again before noon. The snow was quite heavy.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou Transportation Works Bureau's Maps and Documents First Transported to Huaiyin</h3>
<p>The Jiangbei Transportation Works Bureau, after discussions and resolutions at the provincial government, decided to establish a branch in Huaiyin. The bureau has already surveyed and determined that the office buildings of the Zhunpi section's construction site will be used as office space. Currently, the bureau has packed over one hundred important maps, charts, and documents into boxes and dispatched staff member Zhang Peiqiu and others from the administrative affairs section to transport them to Huaiyin in advance. They have also been instructed to repair the surveyed bureau buildings in Huaiyin to prepare for a full relocation. It is reported that Zhang and others are scheduled to depart from Yangzhou on the 26th.</p>
<h3>Engineering Director Supervises Construction of Port Sluice Gate</h3>
<p>The uncompleted sluice gate projects of the eastern and western dikes of the Liyun River, which involve reconstructing them with stone, have now been listed by the Transportation Works Bureau as the second phase of sluice gate projects. The bureau considers the repair of the Qili sluice gate in the Gaoshi section and the construction of the lifesaving port sluice gate to be critical projects. Therefore, it has specially dispatched Xu Demao, the director of the bureau's engineering section, to supervise the construction and expedite progress to ensure early completion.</p>
<h3>Scenery Association's Funding Difficult to Allocate as Planned</h3>
<p>The funding for the Yangzhou City Northern Suburbs Scenery Association was initially planned to be allocated 1,200 yuan from the county's local funds for the 23rd year (of the Republic). However, due to the lack of surplus funds in the local budget, the county submitted a request to the provincial authorities to allocate the funds from the education and construction budgets. The provincial order instructed that the matter be reconsidered when preparing the budget for the 25th year. On the 23rd, the county government specifically recorded the provincial order and notified the association, instructing them to prepare a budget and submit it to the county for compilation.</p>
<h3>Yaogao Baomin Township's Shao Family Robbed</h3>
<p>In Baomin Township, Fourth District, of this county, Shao Youcai, the head of the sixth Jia of the ninth Bao, who is from a moderately prosperous family, was suddenly attacked last night (the 22nd) at midnight by more than ten bandits. They were armed with guns and sharp blades and broke into the house. The family members were all awakened from their dreams. The bandits first tied up the entire Shao family with ropes, then proceeded to loot all the clothes and belongings in the house. Not satisfied, they also seized a newly built large boat belonging to the Shao family, loaded with forty-nine dan of rice, and sailed away southward. Shao has already reported the incident to the county government, requesting the arrest and prosecution of the bandits.</p>
<h3>Nantong Bandits Captured at Qiantan and Escorted to the Special Commissioner's Office</h3>
<p>Shao Guanhong, the supervising officer of the Nantong County Public Security Bureau, led police officers to break up a bandit den in the Qiantan Erxie area. They captured sixteen male and female bandits, including Chen Fenggang and Lian Qianshi. On the 24th, along with the confiscated weapons and ammunition, they were escorted to the Nantong District Special Commissioner's Office for military trial.</p>
<h3>Prison Inmates from Rutai Transferred to Nantong Prison</h3>
<p>The High Court is currently transferring one hundred and twenty inmates sentenced to more than three years of imprisonment from various prisons in Rutai to the Fourth Prison of Nantong to fill the vacancies left after the release on parole.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing Gathering and Training of Bao Chiefs</h3>
<p>The county-wide training of Bao chiefs is now scheduled to begin on March 1st and will last for one month. However, due to the large number of people, the county will first select the younger and stronger ones for training. It has been decided to first select 513 Bao chiefs for the first phase of training. The convening orders have already been issued. All Bao chiefs are required to report by February 28th. However, the Bao chiefs, feeling that the training period is too rushed, have been submitting requests to the county government through the town offices to resign. The county government believes that these Bao chiefs should not be submitting resignation requests at this time to avoid the training, so all requests have been rejected.</p>
<h3>County Government Changes Head of Finance Section</h3>
<p>Zhang Haoming, the head of the Finance Section of the County Government, has been reassigned to the position of head of the Finance Section of the Jiashan County Government. Therefore, he resigned from the Wang County Magistrate of Jiaxing. As a result, the vacancy for the head of the Finance Section of the Jiaxing County Government has been filled by Sun Zhonglai, the secretary of the County Government, who has been appointed by the county.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Spring Cold and Snow Affect Agricultural Production</h3>
<p>The weather in Hangzhou has been unusually cold recently, with a sudden drop in temperature. On the 24th, the Fahrenheit thermometer dropped to 32 degrees. On the morning of the 25th, spring snow fell, melting as it fell, and continued until the afternoon, with the accumulated snow reaching about an inch. The spring cold has become even more severe, with no hope of easing up. According to agricultural experts, this spring snow is harmful to agriculture. Wheat and rapeseed are currently in the developmental stage and are severely affected by the spring freeze, which will inevitably reduce the harvest.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing National Service Continues Work</h3>
<p>The Shaoxing National Labor Service Project has reached five or six tenths of completion. Work was temporarily suspended due to the end of the lunar year and the rain and snow. Since the beginning of spring, in addition to once mobilizing able-bodied men from the Chengdong and Chengzhong towns to concentrate on the Yue Wangtai to organize the Fushan Project, it is now scheduled to fully mobilize able-bodied men from all the towns in the city starting from the 25th to continue the work. The project will continue to be carried out as originally planned.</p>

<h3>Steamship Industry Association Cables Ministry of Communications: Rescue Ships Trapped by Ice, Send Giant Icebreakers to the Rescue, Airplanes to Transport Fuel and Food</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Steamship Industry Association cabled the Ministry of Communications yesterday, stating: "Respectfully to the Ministry of Communications, Nanjing: Recently, the climate in the North has been severely cold, and the ice between Tanggu and Dagu has extended for 60 miles, remaining unfrozen for a long time. Ships are trapped within, and fuel and food are running out, creating a perilous situation where the lives of crew and passengers are at risk, unseen in previous years. Although the Tianjin shipping industry has repeatedly attempted icebreaking rescue efforts, they have been ineffective. The Bohai Bay coastline, including the Jieshi River estuary and Qinhuangdao, are similarly icebound, trapping over 30 ships in total. The dangerous situation has been repeatedly reported in newspapers in recent days, urgently requiring rescue. Considering that your Ministry is in charge of maritime administration, we implore you to urgently implement rescue measures for this imminent crisis. This association has repeatedly received requests from member companies to find a way to come forward. Therefore, we respectfully cable you, urging you to promptly consult the Ministry of Finance to instruct the local customs and the Haihe Engineering Bureau to quickly dispatch icebreakers or rent giant foreign icebreakers for immediate rescue. At the same time, order various airline companies to dispatch airplanes to transport fuel and food, so that rescue can be carried out as soon as possible to alleviate the plight of the many ships and avoid further losses. We are extremely anxious and look forward to your response. Respectfully submitted, Yu Hede, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Steamship Industry Association."</p>
<p>The National News Agency reports: "The severe cold in Tianjin, Dagu, and Qinhuangdao has caused the rivers and sea to freeze over, with the ice even thicker than before. Over 30 ships are trapped, and the crews are extremely anxious due to the lack of food and water, sending telegrams to Tianjin and Shanghai to request rescue. Yesterday, reporters continued to interview relevant parties and learned that the Zhongwei Steamship Company's Xin Taiping vessel has been rescued by a Japanese airplane that delivered food supplies. It has been decided that the trapped ships only lack food and water, and coal is mostly sufficient because several ships were originally carrying coal north. The old Taiping ship has now escaped danger. As for the three ships of the Huatong Steamship Company, Zhonghe, Yongxiang, etc., a telegram was received from Tianjin yesterday, stating that the weather there has improved and the area outside the port has cleared up, so the trapped ships are being rescued by Wang Gengsan, President of the Tianjin Shipping Association, who is supervising the Tianxing, a newly constructed iron barge from the Insurance Federation, which is venturing to break the ice." At the same time, the Ministry of Communications has also received a telegram from Hebei Province requesting rescue, so it will dispatch aircraft for assistance within the next few days. The British Taikoo Steamship Company in this city recently had three ships blocked outside Dagu port, and their food is also running out. Yesterday, a large number of workers were dispatched from Shanghai, carrying necessary tools, to travel north by ship for rescue. It was learned yesterday that a total of 34 Chinese and foreign ships were trapped inside and outside Dagu port. This was reported by a telegram from Tianjin, which also stated that the Dagu Pai area outside the port is the shallowest part of the Dagu port entrance, and it has been frozen for a long time with ice piled up like mountains. The trapped ships closer to this area are in extreme danger because once the ice melts, the ice layers may collapse and cause them to sink. Therefore, the relevant steamship companies in Shanghai have sent telegrams to the Tianjin shipping agencies and local authorities, urging them to move the ships as soon as possible to avoid the risk of being submerged when the ice melts."</p>
<h3>Dadanshan: Imported Lightship Adrift; Customs Urgently Notifies Companies, Telegrams Reach Merchant Ships En Route</h3>
<p>"A Customs lightship originally located at Dadanshan in the Yangtze River estuary, designed to indicate the direction of the waterway and guide ships entering and exiting the Wusongkou from the river and sea, was found to be adrift. The lightship is located 65 nautical miles from Shanghai, between Dadanshan, Niupi, and Jigujiao. Ships arriving in Shanghai from both the North and South Seas and the Yangtze River must rely on the lightship's guidance, making it a true compass for ships entering Shanghai from the river and sea. However, yesterday morning, the Jianghai Customs received a telegram from the French postal ship 'Asia', stating that the Dadanshan import lightship was no longer in its original location, having drifted to a point nine nautical miles east of Dadanshan, specifically at 122 degrees 22 minutes east longitude and 30 degrees 39 minutes north latitude. Upon receiving the report, the Customs recognized the seriousness of the matter, fearing that ships traveling to and from the river and sea, unaware of this incident, would lose guidance and cause a major disaster. Therefore, they immediately notified all shipping companies in the city, instructing them to send telegrams to all ships traveling en route to pay special attention. Meanwhile, Patrol Engineer Carnell dispatched a tugboat to the Dadanshan waters to try to tow the drifting lightship back to its original location to prevent accidents."</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs Takes Over Liebiaozui Lighthouse: Lighthouse Established During the Guangxu Era</h3>
<p>"Datong News Agency reports: The Liebiaozui Lighthouse in Dinghai, which was established by civilians, dates back to the 28th year of the Guangxu reign in the late Qing Dynasty, boasting a long and rich history. The expenses for lamp oil and management were all funded by local residents. However, due to the decline of the market, it has become difficult to sustain these expenses, threatening its closure. Upon learning of this situation, Jianghai Customs, recognizing the extreme importance of the lighthouse for navigation, dispatched a patrol engineer yesterday to take it over. In the future, the expenses will be borne by the Customs, and the lighthouse will continue to emit light to benefit shipping."</p>

They have sent a letter to the Chinese directors attending the Municipal Council regarding the compromise measures proposed, which citizens in various districts have expressed their opposition to. Details are as follows:"</p>
<p>"New Fee Regulations Must Be Overturned"</p>
<p>"The Special District Telephone Issue Committee, in order to convey the intentions of various groups and negotiate with the Municipal Council regarding the Telephone Company's changes to fee regulations, has specifically appointed Qu Zhenhua, Mao Yun, Li Biekuai, Zhang Yiying, Gong Jingyan, Ke Ganchen, Gu Wensheng, and seven others to petition the Chairman of the Municipal Council, Mr. Fessenden, this afternoon at 3:00 PM. They will demand that the Telephone Company's new fee regulations be fundamentally overturned. At the very least, the basic number of calls must be calculated at three cents per call in order to be fair; otherwise, they will not hesitate to make any sacrifice."</p>
<p>"Meeting Tomorrow to Report Progress"</p>
<p>"The committee has also scheduled to hold its third Board of Directors meeting yesterday to report on the progress of the petition to the concession authorities. A notice has already been issued, stating: 'Regarding the imminent implementation of the new telephone system, if we do not actively proceed, it will definitely cause delay. Therefore, on the 26th of this month, Qu Zhenhua and seven others will be appointed to petition the Municipal Council to negotiate the cancellation of the price increase. A third Board of Directors meeting will be held on the 27th to report on the progress. This matter is of great importance, please do not ignore it.'"</p>
<p>"Letter Requesting Chinese Directors to Conduct Public Negotiations"</p>
<p>"The 12th, 15th, 36th, 38th, and 39th district branches of the First Special District Citizens' Union of this city have expressed dissatisfaction with the measures proposed by the Chinese directors. Yesterday, they specifically jointly sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Concessions, requesting that the basic number of calls be uniformly calculated at three cents per call and requesting continued resistance. The original letter reads: 'The Shanghai Telephone Company, in order to satisfy its desire for an annual interest of one percent, has specifically promulgated new regulations that charge by call. City users absolutely cannot agree to this kind of disguised price increase. We have requested your association's directors attending the Municipal Council to strongly resist. If it is necessary to calculate by call, the basic number of calls must also be calculated at a rate of three cents, that is, a business telephone with a monthly fee of ten yuan should have 333 calls, and a residential telephone with a monthly fee of six yuan and five jiao should have 216 calls, in order to be fair. Otherwise, the charge of three cents per call for exceeding the basic number of calls is more than double the cost of 6.6 cents per call for the basic calls. The unreasonableness of this measure is very obvious. Therefore, we have repeatedly requested your association to convene a ratepayers' meeting to solicit the opinions of all users in order to collectively resist. However, according to the newspapers, your association held its sixth executive committee meeting on the 22nd and surprisingly agreed with the directors' opinions, changing the basic calls for business telephones to 200 and residential telephones to 150. If the company's net profit exceeds 10 percent, prices should be immediately reduced, and the more calls used, the lower the cost per call, etc. It seems that this kind of opinion is absolutely a minority opinion, and it is unlikely that all taxpayers in the city will agree. Therefore, we specifically jointly send a letter to your association to convey to the directors attending the Municipal Council that the city's users absolutely cannot agree unless the basic calls are based on a standard of three cents. We believe that all the directors have a heavy responsibility entrusted to them by the taxpayers of the city and will definitely uphold public opinion and work hard to negotiate in order to console public hope.'"</p>
<h3>Finance Ministry Improves Methods for Customs Inspection of Overseas Chinese Entering and Leaving the Country; Instructs Director General of Customs to Draft Six Measures</h3>
<p>"Shen Shi News Agency reports: According to news from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau, overseas Chinese organizations and returned overseas Chinese often complain that the customs in various ports of South China often make things difficult when inspecting the luggage of overseas Chinese entering and leaving the country, or even harass them. They have repeatedly complained to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has successively sent letters to the Ministry of Finance, requesting that they find ways to eliminate this. The Ministry of Finance, together with the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, dispatched personnel to various ports in South China to conduct on-site investigations. They found that the various complaints made by overseas Chinese, due to different environmental conditions in each port, resulted in various difficulties and misunderstandings, and that such incidents sometimes occurred. They ordered the Director General of Customs to draft six measures for improvement, seeking the consent of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission considered the measures to be fair and fully agreed. They will be implemented separately by the Ministry of Finance. The measures are as follows: It is proposed that the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission find a way to have the consulates of our country abroad, chambers of commerce of our country, or overseas Chinese associations, etc., be responsible for issuing (A) a certificate to each overseas Chinese person when they return to their country. This certificate must have a photograph of the person attached, and a detailed list of the personal and household items they are carrying, as well as miscellaneous items. The validity of this certificate is limited to one trip. (B) A booklet explaining the various rules and regulations of Chinese Customs for managing passenger luggage. This booklet should be compiled by the Customs and printed and distributed by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. It is proposed that the government issue a circular to local authorities, assisting the Customs in prohibiting smugglers from boarding ships as soon as they arrive in port. It is proposed to negotiate with the Xinning Railway Bureau to expand and improve the Beijie wharf on that road. If this cannot be done, the Customs will find ways to build appropriate wharves and inspection facilities for use. It is proposed that the Director General of Customs issue a circular to all ports, instructing all foreign customs officers to treat passengers on ships with courtesy. If passengers refuse to follow customs procedures, they must also maintain a peaceful attitude to persuade them to comply and must not be rude. If they do not comply, their promotion will be suspended as a warning. It is proposed that the Jianghai Customs dispatch customs officers to board incoming ships passing through Hengmen, to strictly search all parts of the ship, except for passenger cabins and passenger luggage, on the way from the incoming ship to Jiangmen, and to prevent private goods from being thrown into the sea along the way. Passenger cabins will be searched after the passengers disembark at Beijie, and passenger luggage will be inspected uniformly at the wharf to avoid the trouble of mixing and duplication, and the practice of hiding private goods can also be prevented in advance. However, if this is done, although the customs will increase the number of investigators, the Customs Commissioner of the port can propose the number of additional personnel that should be increased and submit it for approval. The Qionghai Customs' current method of inspecting passenger luggage on board ships is proposed to be discontinued, as the luggage will be transported by barges at that time, and this kind of inspection cannot be handled perfectly in a short period of time."</p>

After arriving in Beijing this morning, they will immediately jointly petition, demanding the amendment of the Silver Product Silver Usage Management Regulations. The objectives are: Jewelry silver should still use pure silver. Utensils and gifts can use 80% silver. Furthermore, Fu Shengmao, Chairman of the Shanghai Gold and Silver Shop Industry Association, canceled his trip to Beijing due to his unhealed foot injury."</p>
<p>"Another Telegram of Appeal"</p>
<p>"The association telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating: 'We have found that our gold and silver shop industry has, since November of last year, received the Silver Usage Management Regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Finance, limiting the use of chemical silver to manufacture utensils and ornaments, and only allowing a maximum of 30% pure silver to be added when necessary. Merchants and the public know that chemical silver is rigid and fragile, making it difficult to manufacture by hand, which will cause hundreds of thousands of workers in the national industry to be unemployed. We have submitted another request to amend the regulations to exempt the restrictions, but it has not been approved. On the 23rd of this month, more than 600 representatives gathered in Shanghai to hold a joint meeting of the national gold and silver shop industry, borrowing the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. Together we decided to send representatives to Beijing to petition and earnestly appeal to the authorities. We respectfully request your inspection and implore you to show compassion, so as to achieve the purpose of amending the regulations and exempting the restrictions in order to maintain the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of people in the national industry. We are very anxious and implore you to grant our prayer.'"</p>

<h3>Dr. Wang Guangqi Passed Away in Germany</h3>
<p>Dr. Wang Guangqi went to Germany to study in the ninth year of the Republic of China (1920). For sixteen years, he initially studied political economy, and for the past ten years, he specialized in music. In the twenty-third year of the Republic of China (1934), he obtained a doctoral degree from the University of Bonn. His dissertation was titled "The Ancient Chinese Opera." He had a wealth of writings throughout his life, with more than forty kinds published domestically. His contribution to the academic and ideological circles of our country was rarely seen in recent times. His strict self-discipline and diligence in learning were sufficient to be a model for others. Unfortunately, he recently suffered from cerebral congestion and passed away in Bonn, on the banks of the Rhine River in Germany. He died young while diligently pursuing his studies, fulfilling his ambitions until the end, which is truly a great loss to the nation's talent. It is said that his old friends, Mr. Shu Xincheng of the Compilation and Translation Institute of the Zhonghua Book Company, Mr. Zuo Shunsheng of the Central Political School, and Mr. Wei Shizhen of the National Sichuan University, etc., plan to compile a general catalog of Mr. Wang's posthumous works in the near future, and publish a special commemorative volume to express their condolences. It is noted that Mr. Wang once served as a correspondent for this newspaper in Germany.</p>
<h3>Mr. Shengjia Lectures on the Development of Internal Combustion Engines</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the Chinese Institute of Engineers held a gathering, where the famous engineer Mr. Shengjia lectured on the development of internal combustion engines. In essence, the progress of aircraft engines and automobile engines is advancing by leaps and bounds, almost exceeding expectations. However, the development of diesel engines has reached a point where further major progress is unlikely. Ultra-high-pressure internal combustion engines are a new invention, and the future development and progress of this is unlimited. Mr. Shengjia also pointed out the path of improvement and progress, but the nature is extremely specialized, so it is not recorded.</p>

<h3>Yangshupu Road, Weixing Lane: Fire Claims Four Lives, Child Thrown from Window, Three Houses Destroyed, Two Children Injured</h3>
<p>The houses on No. 152, Yangshupu Road (i.e., Weixing Lane), are all one-story above another, commonly known as "Japanese houses." At around 10:30 yesterday morning, a fire suddenly broke out in the home of Yang Xiaorong at No. 12 in the lane. The stairs were also burned, and the tenants of the Tang and Wu families living upstairs, finding their escape route cut off, hurriedly threw their children from the window. Fortunately, neighbors on the left and right heard the alarm and gathered together, and cooperated in catching them below the window. However, the fire was extremely fierce at the time, with thick smoke and flames reaching the sky. Therefore, in a short while, the house had turned to ashes. The house was crowded with people, and some were unable to escape. In addition, the two buildings to the left and right, Nos. 10 and 14, were also on fire, causing the neighbors to be too busy fleeing for their lives to continue rescuing people, leaving the fire to spread. For a time, the noise was deafening, and the order was chaotic. The cries shook heaven and earth. The nearby yamen (police) received the news and immediately telegraphed the Central Fire Brigade, which informed the Yangshupu Fire Brigade to rush fire trucks and ambulances to put out the fire. They vigorously sprayed water while rescuing people. They rescued two children from the fire pit, one named Tang Rongzhang, twelve years old, and the other named Tang Baogen, only three years old. However, both were burned all over their bodies and were rushed to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment, in critical condition. The fire was completely extinguished at around 12:00. As a result, three houses, Nos. 10, 12, and 14, were burned down, and all the property was destroyed. Afterwards, firefighters dug through the fire site and found a middle-aged woman and three children buried in the fire pit, with charred heads and faces, and a foul odor, the scene was unbearable to witness. After being identified by the neighbors, it was learned that the woman was Wu Kongshi, a Ningbo woman residing in the front building of No. 12, forty years old, who had just moved in last week. Now she encounters this disaster, is this her fate? Among the three children, two were Wu Kongshi's sons, the elder named Wu Xiaomao, seven years old, and the younger named Wu Xiaogen, four years old. There was also a son of the Tang family, named Tang Mingfang, nine years old. At the time, once their deaths were confirmed, their family members cried to the heavens and earth, wailing uncontrollably. Those who saw it could not help but feel grief. The firefighters and detectives consoled them, and then sent the four corpses to the coroner's office to be examined, and after the examination, they would be coffined and buried. An investigation into the cause of the fire will be conducted to bring those responsible to justice.</p>
<h3>Rain and Snow Fell Again Yesterday, Ceasing Not All Day, Weather Turning Cold, Greatly Hindering Agricultural Affairs</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of spring, the weather has not yet warmed up, and there has been a lot of rain. Yesterday morning, rain and snow fell again, ceasing not all day, and the weather was even colder. According to those experienced in agricultural affairs, this is a sign that there will be more rain this year. If it does not clear up and warm up again, it will greatly hinder agricultural affairs. This kind of abnormal weather is rare in recent years.</p>
<h3>Tracks Slippery, Tram Derailed, Damaging a Rickshaw, Passengers and Rickshaw Puller Fortunately Unharmed</h3>
<p>The tram of the French Tram Company running on the Sixteenth Puli Road, driven by driver No. 74, departed from the Lujiazui factory at 8:50 yesterday morning. When it drove to the junction of Fangxie Road and Wansheng Bridge in the South City, due to the rain and snow, the tracks were slippery, causing all four wheels of the tram to derail. A rickshaw carrying passengers from north to south failed to avoid it, and the wheels were completely damaged. Fortunately, the passengers were unharmed. The police and company ticket inspectors arrived, recorded the numbers of the driver and rickshaw, and dragged the derailed wheels back onto the track, restoring traffic. The damaged rickshaw was taken by the rickshaw puller Chen Jinsheng to the Ximen Branch for investigation and compensation.</p>
<h3>Temples in This City Will Be Re-registered Next Month, Set from March 2nd to the End of June</h3>
<p>According to Guomin News, regarding the issue of temple registration in this port, the municipal government has already undertaken it. In May of the eighteenth year of the Republic of China (1929), all 103 case files were ordered to be handled by the Municipal Public Security Bureau. The bureau accepted and started registering temples, and to date, 4 case files have been approved, and 252 have not been approved. However, the Ministry of the Interior has stipulated that the temple registration case should be handled by the Social Affairs Bureau of each province and city, and the municipal government has been consulted to instruct the affiliated departments to comply. It is now known that after Bureau Chief Wu Xingya was ordered, he instructed Sun Yongyi, director of the fourth section of the Public Welfare Department, to handle the matter and report back. Director Sun took the document to the Public Security Bureau at 2:00 yesterday afternoon to accept all the case files. Hong Qi, chief of the second section of the Public Security Bureau, dispatched staff member Jin Zhongjian to handle the transfer. According to Sun, the registration of temples in this city will begin on March 2nd (next Monday) and will end at the end of June this year. Regardless of whether they have been registered or have requested registration but have not been approved, they will all be re-registered.</p>
<h3>Special Second Court Investigates Yesterday, Gu Zhuxuan's Family Denies Bribery, Gu Songmao Pays 1,000 Yuan Bail</h3>
<p>Gu Zhuxuan, the main criminal who instigated the assassination of Tang Jiapeng, was sentenced to fifteen years in prison by the Special Second Court and appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court. After the trial, a case of bribery and retraction of testimony and escape from prison by a guard was discovered. The Special Second Prosecutor's Office has been conducting a strict investigation for more than half a month. The details have been recorded in previous reports. At 9:30 yesterday morning, Prosecutor Wang Ren arrived at the Sixth Investigation Office to question Gu Zhuxuan's three elder brothers, Gu Songmao, and Gu's family members, Gu Cai, Gu Li, Gu's brother-in-law Zheng Jian, and the director of the detention center, Wu, and guard Ma Xinchang, and six other people. Because the prosecutor ordered outsiders not to be allowed to listen, the details could not be recorded. According to reporters, the content of the investigation was to investigate the 3,000 yuan deposit in the name of Zhang Sen, a client of the Daya Bank, and whether there was bribery of the guards to buy the retraction of the prisoner's testimony. Gu's family members all vehemently denied everything. As a result, the prosecutor ordered the two guards, Wu and Ma, not to leave their posts during the investigation period. Gu Songmao paid a cash bond of 1,000 yuan to be available for summons at any time, otherwise he would be taken into custody. The court adjourned at 11:00 noon.</p>
<h3>Famous Hunter Initiates Wildlife Refuge for Wild Birds</h3>
<p>According to the Great America Evening News, Mr. Keming, a well-known broker and hunter in this port, and Mr. Wilkinson, a well-known ornithologist and author of books on birds, in order to preserve the lives of many birds that pass through Shanghai every year, intend to strive to designate the western and northeastern areas of Shanghai as wildlife refuges, where hunting is not allowed. The two men will ask Mayor Wu to approve the addition of Greater Shanghai to the plan, and request the central authorities to cooperate in its implementation within their jurisdiction. The Shanghai Western Bird Sanctuary will be bounded by the Suzhou River and Bubbling Well Road, and will extend south from the airfield to the Huangpu River, with an area of at least twenty square miles. According to Mr. Keming, this move does not hinder legal hunters, because if they want to hunt birds, they can go to a slightly farther place. Many birds with beautiful voices and feathers fly from outside to Shanghai every year, looking very tired. Hunters shoot birds at sight, without any distinction, and the orioles that fly in summer are especially admired by them. The reason why they want to protect the birds around Shanghai is to keep them for the enjoyment of the residents, and because Shanghai is densely populated, hunting here can easily injure or kill people with stray bullets. This has been seen many times in the past. The initiators hope that the Chinese and foreign authorities and residents will cooperate with this plan.</p>
<h3>Insurance Customer, American Woman Commits Suicide by Shooting</h3>
<p>Ms. Woen, an American woman who worked in the insurance business and was thirty-seven years old, committed suicide by shooting herself at around 9:15 yesterday morning at her residence at No. 760, HSBC Building. She was shot in the head. The servant heard the sound and went to check, and Ms. Woen was lying in a pool of blood, with a pistol next to her. She was rushed to the Public Hospital for treatment, but died of her injuries in the afternoon. Ms. Woen was not married, her family was in the United States, and she had been in Shanghai for about five years. The insurance management office where she worked had recently closed. Her suicide was probably due to financial difficulties. When the American authorities examined the body yesterday, no suicide note was found.</p>
<h3>Moving Due to Rumors, Maid Steals Items, Case of Ding Peng's Death from Anger Solved, Maid Apprehended in Huzhou</h3>
<p>In November of last year, due to rumors in Zhabei, the general public was like frightened birds, and moved to the concession one after another. Peng, the wife of Ding Bingchang, a Wuxi native at No. 316, Zhonghua Xin Road, also temporarily hid her valuable suitcases and items in the concession. Unexpectedly, the maid Wang seized the opportunity to steal a valuable clothes box and fled without a trace. The box contained diamond rings, pearls, gold jewelry, jade, gemstones, etc., worth more than 3,000 yuan. Although the matter was reported to the Yongxing Road Police Station for investigation, no progress had been made to this day. The mistress Ding Peng died of grief and anger because of this. It is now known that after several months, the case was recently solved by the Detective Brigade of the Huzhou Security Command in Zhejiang Province at No. 3, Shijia Lane, in the city. After the team confirmed the facts, they notified the Shanghai Public Security Bureau to come and escort the suspect back to Shanghai. The Detective Brigade of the North Station Branch also summoned Ding Bingchang, the owner of the stolen goods, to identify the stolen items. The maid confessed that her real name was Peng Ge, forty-two years old, from Danyang, and that she falsely claimed to be Wang. In November of last year, she was introduced by Lu, a barber at the intersection of Henan Road and Aeherjin Road in North Shanghai, to work as a maid in the Ding family. When the Ding family was moving, she saw a leather handbag and a tin box containing a lot of jewelry. She stole them when the owner was unprepared. She stayed in a hotel that night, and the next morning, she pawned three strings of large and small pearls at a pawnshop in Huangpu for 80 yuan to use as travel expenses. She took a boat to Huzhou to her lover Zhao Honggen. All the gold jewelry was sold to gold shops for more than 400 yuan. Only three large pearls and a gold bracelet were given to Zhou Xia, the woman she lived with. The rest was cheated away by her lover. After reviewing the confession, Gu Liancheng and Guo Mengqu, the deputy chiefs of the team, dispatched detectives Zhang Dalong and Jiao Bingyun to retrieve the original pawn tickets.</p>
<h3>Robbers Burglarize and Murder on Gordon Road, Owner Subdues One Robber, Lu San is Tragically Killed by Robber's Gunshot Wound to Vital Spot, Owner Bites Robber's Wrist to Capture Him</h3>
<p>The home of Lu Shide, a Jiangbei native at No. 584, Yodah Corner, Gordon Road in Western Shanghai, was suddenly broken into by two robbers, Li Yisan and Dakezi, both from Jiangbei, at 6:30 the day before yesterday afternoon. Dakezi held the door, and Li took out a pistol in the living room, threatening Lu Shide, his wife Lu Wang, and his son Lu Xuewu not to shout. He forced Lu Wang to remove the gold earrings she was wearing. At that time, Lu Shide's brother, Lu San, also known as Zhao Fuhai (49 years old, from Jiangbei), heard the alarm in the back room and walked out of the room. The robber Li immediately fired a shot at him.</p>
<p>The bullet hit his forehead, and at that time, the robber holding the door saw that he had already caused a disaster, and fled on foot. Li Yisan, who fired the gun, also tried to turn around and escape, but Lu Xuewu stepped forward and grabbed Li's right hand holding the gun. Li was in a hurry and fired several more shots, all of which missed. However, because Li was tall and strong, and Lu Xuewu was determined to resist, they twisted together into a ball, and gradually twisted out of the door. The injured Lu San and Lu Wang also chased out of the door, but because Lu San's injuries were too severe and he lacked the strength to support himself, he fell to the ground at the door of his residence, blood gushing out like a spring.</p>
<p>He fainted immediately. At that time, Lu Xuewu and Lu Wang had grabbed the robber Li's left and right hands, and Lu Xuewu bit down hard on the robber Li's right wrist, causing Li to be in pain and drop the pistol. Someone was sent to report to the No. 22 Indian police to arrest Li and seize a pistol, which had no bullets in it. The Indian police telegraphed the Gordon Road Police Station, which immediately sent Chinese and Western detectives to investigate, and found a shell casing and a bullet, and then Li was taken into custody at the police station. The injured Lu San was sent to the St. Luke's Hospital, but because the injury was to the brain,</p>
<p>He died shortly after, and the body was sent to the Pei Lun Road coroner's office for examination. Yesterday morning, the police sent Li Yisan to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted him for robbery and murder according to Article 332, Paragraph 4 of the Criminal Code, and stated the above situation, saying that according to the defendant's confession in the police station, he did not know Dakezi, who was at large, and was introduced by Mei Shitian. The police, together with the Public Security Bureau, went to No. 15, Qia Jian Fruit, Tanziwan Road, Zhabei, and arrested Mei, who is now detained by the Public Security Bureau, and requested that the court prepare a document to transfer him</p>
<p>To the court for investigation, etc. Subsequently, Lu Wang and Lu Xuewu filed a case to prove everything, and Lu Xuewu confessed that he was injured in his thumb when he grabbed the defendant's hand holding the gun and the defendant resisted by firing the gun, etc. In response, the defendant Li Yisan confessed to going with Dakezi to rob, but denied deliberately firing the gun and killing Lu San, saying that it was because his hand holding the gun was grabbed by Lu Xuewu and the pistol was snatched away, causing him to accidentally touch the trigger, and the bullet was shot out and hit the deceased, etc. Judge Wu Zehan reviewed the confession and considered that it was necessary to</p>
<p>Inspect the scene of the incident, and ordered the defendant to be returned to custody and rescheduled the hearing for the morning of March 3, and scheduled to go to the site for inspection at 2:00 pm on March 2. After the ruling, the defendant was taken down by the detective and transferred to the coroner's office. Prosecutor Zhang Zongru arrived at the office and examined the body, and then ruled that the deceased Lu San, male, died of a gunshot wound before death, and the body was handed over to his family Lu Xuewu to claim and bury. The murderer Li Yisan and the pistol were sent to the court by the police for handling.</p>
<h3>Luodian Town: Gambling Collapse Tragedy, More Than Ten People Bleeding, Seriously and Minorly Injured</h3>
<p>At around 10:00 the day before yesterday evening, the Gong Rende cigarette paper and sundries store, household No. 9, 15th Jia, 1st Bao, South Lane Street, Luodian Town, Baoshan County, through which the Shanghai-Taicang long-distance bus passes, gathered seventy or eighty gamblers. They were gambling on pai gow on the mezzanine floor behind the store. It was known that there were too many people and the mezzanine floor was not strong enough. With a crash, the mezzanine floor collapsed, resulting in a tragic incident of broken arms, broken feet, and bloody heads. The director of the Public Security Third Branch in the town, Director Dong, learned of this and sent the police to summon the store owner Gong Qingxiang, who had already fled. Only Gong's father, named A Da, and a cohabitant, Zhu Afu, were brought to the case. Director Dong then found that there were more than ten people who were slightly and seriously injured. Those with more serious injuries included Zheng Zongheng, who was injured in the head, forehead, and left hand dislocated; Cai A'er, who had a broken foot bone; Zhang Amao, who was injured in the ankle; Yang Maoquan, whose hands and feet were dislocated, etc. Those with minor injuries were all sent to the hospital for treatment. It is still impossible to predict whether there is any danger to life. However, the case involves gathering people to gamble, so it was sent to the county government yesterday afternoon for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Ignoring Mortgage Payments, Sheng Yuchang is Accused</h3>
<p>Sheng Yuchang, the eldest grandson of Sheng Xingxun, a courtier of the late Qing Dynasty, mortgaged 14 mu of cemetery land at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Baker Road to the China Business Company on March 7, 1933, for 650,000 taels of silver, totaling 909,090.91 yuan in national currency, with an agreed interest rate of 9% per annum. When it was due on March 1 of last year, China Business Company repeatedly urged him to redeem it, but Sheng ignored it. The company then hired lawyer Yang Ruinian to file a lawsuit with the First Special District Court, demanding the return of 987,000 yuan in national currency. Yesterday morning, Judge Li of the Sixth Civil Court summoned him. The defendant Sheng Yuchang hired a lawyer to present a defense, stating that the defendant previously had 16,000 shares of the Sanxin Yarn Factory's stock, and had mortgaged it to the China Business Company for 400,000 taels of silver. Later, Sanxin was sold to others by the company in 1931 for 4.5 million taels, leaving 4.3 million taels after deducting the commission of 200,000. The defendant should have received one-fifth, which is 860,000 taels. The plaintiff has not yet paid this amount to the defendant and should be used to offset the mortgage. Plaintiff Yang Ruinian, on the other hand, stated that all the funds of Sanxin had been cleared. Judge Li considered that it was necessary to investigate the case and ordered it to be rescheduled for questioning.</p>

<h3>Public Concession: Overview of Last Year's Public Works Report</h3>
<p>According to the 1935 work report of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, the completed construction projects that year included the following: One bridge project, consisting of two reinforced concrete bridges at Pingji and Dinghai Roads, each sixty in length; in terms of buildings, there were the Central Police Station on Fuzhou Road, the Chengdu Road Police Station and housing, the Huade Road West Prison, the expanded part of the Public Works Bureau meat market and slaughterhouse on Qinqin Road, the abandoned animal disposal station on Qinqin Road, the expansion of the Tongzhou Road vegetable market, the reconstruction of the Huishan public pier, the central laundry of the Public Works Bureau Hospital on Feilun Road, and the Zhoushan Road hygiene branch, etc.; In terms of roads, important sections of Nanjing Road, Henan Road, Broadway Road, Beijing Road, Avenue Edward VII, etc., were widened, with a total of more than 14,000 cubic yards of roadbed and pavement construction; about half a mile of pavement was rebuilt with concrete and asphalt. All the streetlights within the concession have now been converted to electric lights. The revetment constructed on Dixiwei Road is approximately one hundred yards in length. In addition to the Huishan public pier, the floating pier on the Bund of Beijing Road has also been renovated. A total of six and a quarter miles of drains and sewage pipes were laid. In terms of parks, the construction of the Huzhou Road Park was completed in that year. A new stone crushing machine was installed at the Pingqiao Stone Quarry. Due to financial constraints, the larger of the above public buildings were limited to those that had already commenced construction in the previous year.</p>
<p>Regarding private construction, projects this year were even more reduced compared to the previous year. The total value of new buildings was just over ten million, whereas in 1934 it was still over twenty-seven million six hundred and sixty thousand. The total population surveyed within the concession this year was approximately 1.15 million, an increase of 150,000 people compared to five years ago. However, during these years, there has been no excessive construction of housing, and there are still crowded conditions in the residences of poor residents within the concession. It is expected that when economic conditions recover in the future, new construction will commence.</p>
<p>Regarding private construction, although the number of buildings has decreased, violations of construction regulations are almost innumerable. This may be related to the social economy. On the one hand, builders are trying to save as much as possible, and on the other hand, contractors are also trying to cut corners and reduce materials to compete with each other. Furthermore, there is another matter that should be noted regarding wooden buildings within the concession, namely, the gradual spread of termites, which is a major concern for the future. Therefore, when constructing, if one is concerned that the wood contains these pests and wants to eliminate them, one can contact the Public Works Department for instructions on how to eliminate them.</p>
<p>Regarding the staff of the Public Works Department, the head of the department took leave to return to his country on July 1 and did not return until November 19. During this period, the extra head of the department acted as head of affairs. Ten new employees were hired this year, one died, eleven resigned, and three were transferred to other locations. The total number of foreign employees this year was 120, a decrease of five from the previous year. The number of Chinese employees has also decreased from 539 last year to 534 this year.</p>

<h3>Lawsuit over HSBC Shares after Liu Zanqi's Death: Liu's Wife Sues Her Aunt to Transfer the Shares; Family Members Also Join the Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Liu Weichuan, a wealthy merchant from Guangdong, and his wife, Tian Xiangyun, had two sons and two daughters together. The eldest son was named Zanlin, who married Qian Suyu. The second son was Zanqi, who married Guo Xiurong. The eldest daughter was Huiyan, and the second daughter was Minyan. In the nineteenth year, Liu Weichuan went bankrupt due to business failure and soon passed away. Zanlin also died of illness without any heirs. Zanqi had three sons and one daughter: Rongzu, Yaozu, Guangzu, and the youngest daughter, Guoying. Guangzu was then adopted as Zanlin's heir. Zanqi served as the manager of the Yongtaihe Yinxing Company's Beijing branch. Last October, he also died in Tianjin due to a sudden cerebral hemorrhage. Now, Liu Guo Xiurong suddenly, along with her sons Rongzu and Yaozu, and daughter Guoying, hired a lawyer to sue her aunt Tian Xiangyun in the First Special District Court, requesting confirmation of inheritance rights. The subject of the lawsuit is ten shares of HSBC bank stock, with a market value of tens of thousands of dollars. The reason is that the shares were used as a guarantee for Zanqi's employment. Now, the aunt has taken the shares and transferred them. Therefore, they request confirmation of the inheritance rights to the shares. Liu Tian Xiangyunyun also hired lawyer Zhang Ziyun to defend, stating that the HSBC shares have always belonged to the defendant. Because Zanqi joined Yongtaihe, she deposited them into the company as collateral. Later, when he was promoted to manager, he requested to transfer the account to his name for the sake of appearances. When Zanqi died, she took them back and entrusted a lawyer to correct the account name, as evidenced by Zanqi's letters. Liu Qian Suyu, Liu Huiyan, and Liu Minyan believed that they all had a relationship with these rights and could not allow Guo Xiurong to take possession of them alone. Therefore, they also hired lawyer Yang Guoshu to join the lawsuit. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Mo Runhua opened the sixth civil court to summon them. After the lawyers for the plaintiff, defendant, and intervenors presented their reasons, the court ordered a postponement for another hearing.</p>
<h3>Nanyang Business Delegation: Announces the Organization Process; Overseas Chinese Merchants in Nanyang Are Concentrated and Happy to Use National Products; Engage in On-the-Spot Investigation, Communication, and Introduction</h3>
<p>The Nanyang Business Delegation is actively preparing to depart with the aim of developing national products and reversing the import surplus. To make the organization process of the delegation clear to all sectors, the circumstances of the delegation's initiation are announced as follows: In recent years, due to backward industries, a sharp increase in the import surplus, commercial depression, rural bankruptcy, and national product industries, they also feel that there is no way out and have no room for development. Since the implementation of the new monetary policy, goods have flowed smoothly, and exports have gradually become lively. It is permissible to regard trade with Nanyang as the most promising. Nanyang is an area where overseas Chinese merchants are concentrated, the region is vast, the population is large, the financial resources are abundant, and the relationship with the motherland has a long history. In addition, the patriotic enthusiasm of overseas Chinese and the psychology of using national products happily are well known to the Chinese people. In recent years, the progress of the motherland's national product industries, as well as the excellence of the products, and their degree, may not be fully known to overseas Chinese. The Chinese industrial circles also want to know about it. If they can conduct on-the-spot investigations, engage in promotion, communicate internal and external opinions, and connect each other's feelings, this is the reason for the initiation of the Nanyang Business Delegation of this association. The mission of this delegation includes seven points in its essentials: Declare the latest status quo of the national product industry in the motherland and the manufacturing conditions of various factories; Investigate the living conditions of overseas Chinese in Nanyang and the articles they usually use, study improvements to suit their psychology and preferences; Investigate the trends of the Nanyang market and the degree of purchasing power of the general society; Investigate the currency and exchange rate situation in Nanyang; Investigate the donations, taxes, and procedures for transportation in Nanyang, and seek standards; Contact the Nanyang business community to discuss methods for distributing national products; Contact overseas Chinese in Nanyang, introduce national products, and schedule to communicate with the motherland's industrial and commercial circles at any time. Given the enthusiasm of overseas Chinese in Nanyang for using national products, and the growing prosperity of Nanyang business, coupled with the recent progress of national products in our country, both in quality and quantity, there has been amazing progress. By taking this opportunity to enable each other to have a deeper understanding, the achievements of this trip should be considerable. We respectfully describe the outline to inspire comrades. If you approve, why not come! Sincerely recorded by the China Industrial and Foreign Trade Association.</p>
<h3>The Owner of the Barge Sunk by the New Jiangtian Wheel Reports to the Navigation Bureau: Only Eight of the Eleven Crew Members Survived; The Navigation Bureau Will Summon the Captain of the Jiangtian Wheel for Questioning</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the New Jiangtian Wheel of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company recently collided with and sank a large barge while entering Shanghai from Ningbo. Because the wheel's rescue was ineffective, it immediately sailed to Shanghai and reported to the Navigation Administration and the Port Affairs Bureau. At that time, it was only known that the barge had sunk, and all the crew members were missing. It is now learned that nine of the crew members were fortunate enough to jump into a sampan and drift to Pudong, where they were rescued. They then reported the incident to the Navigation Administration a few days ago. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Barge Owner Reports to the Navigation Bureau:</p>
<p>After the incident of the New Jiangtian Wheel colliding with the barge occurred, the wheel's captain, Qiang Sheng, and first mate, Yu Tingyuan, and others, submitted reports to the Navigation Administration and the Port Affairs Bureau. However, at that time, because the barge sank and the crew members were missing, it was not possible to determine who was responsible. The Navigation Administration then sent letters to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Jianghai Customs to inquire about the details, but no reply was received. Several days ago, news of the rescue was reported, but no one came to the bureau to report. It was not until last Saturday that a person named Luo Xingchun, claiming to be the owner of the barge, and his helmsman, Chen Tianqing, came to the bureau to identify and report the incident. The bureau then took a written statement from him.</p>
<p>The Barge Was Carrying Oil to Ningbo on the Day of the Collision:</p>
<p>According to Luo's statement, he is the owner of the barge, 55 years old, from Huangyan. The barge's name is Jin Wanli, it cost 14,000 yuan to build, and has a capacity of 1,200 bags of rice. It is registered with the Haimen Navigation Administration and is used to transport cargo. On this occasion, it was chartered to load 360 barrels of Texaco diesel oil, weighing 60 tons, in Shanghai and was sailing to Ningbo to unload the cargo. The barge was piloted by the helmsman, Chen Tianqing, while he himself took the wheel to Ningbo first to wait for the barge to arrive and deliver the cargo. Unfortunately, it was sunk by the New Jiangtian Wheel. After receiving the news, he immediately rushed to Shanghai and specially accompanied Chen Tianqing to report the incident to the bureau.</p>
<p>Could Not Avoid the Collision and Was Sunk:</p>
<p>Chen Tianqing stated that he is the helmsman of the barge, 40 years old, from Huangyan. He has been a helmsman for nearly ten years and was hired to work on this barge last year. On February 14 this year, after loading diesel oil at Texaco at 11 a.m., he sailed to Wusong at 4 p.m. On the 15th, he cleared customs. For several days, he could not sail due to the south wind. At 3 a.m. on the 18th, he set anchor in the northeast wind, sailed along the southern foot of the outer buoy of Songkou, and headed east and south for the exit. He saw a wheel ship moored on his right front, so he sailed past the wheel's bow, about two wheel ship lengths away. Afterwards, he saw a large red light in front of his left, but it was far away, so he continued to proceed along the original route. As he got closer, he knew it was an incoming wheel ship. He immediately turned slightly to the right. Unexpectedly, the wheel also turned to the left. The momentum was very rapid, and no echo was heard. By the time he wanted to avoid, it was too late, and he crashed into the barge's left舷 at the bow.</p>
<p>Eight People Survived, Three Drowned:</p>
<p>After the collision, the bow of the barge immediately sank. At that time, there were a total of eleven crew members on board. Two people were standing at the bow and sank with the wheel ship and drowned immediately. The remaining nine people were at the stern and immediately lowered the sampan to escape. One person did not have time to board the sampan and also sank with the ship. Only eight people survived. The wreckage of the ship flowed along the right舷 of the New Jiangtian Wheel. At that time, the crew members called for help, but the wheel ship ignored them and continued to move forward. The sampan drifted with the tide and was rescued at Wangjiawan in Pudong about an hour later. The whole incident took only half a quarter of an hour and occurred at about 4:30 a.m. that morning. The sailboat had a white square light lit and hanging on the aft cabin shed. At that time, there was a weak northeast wind, and the tide was flat, near the beginning of the tide. According to the bureau, the statement was slightly inconsistent with the New Jiangtian Wheel's report, so the wheel's captain and others will be summoned for questioning again.</p>
<h3>The Winner of the 19th Aviation Lottery First Prize: Old Doctor Remembered Winning the First Prize; The Upper and Lower Attached Prizes All Fell to the Gengwu Association</h3>
<p>The draw for the 19th National Government Aviation Highway Construction Lottery was held on the 7th of this month at the Yiyuan Amusement Park in Shanghai. The first prize, number 11582, was distributed by the cash wholesale department of the Da Yun Company to a member of the Gengwu Dinner Association on Liyuan Road in the Nanshi district of this city. It is reported that the association has been established for many years, with more than twenty members. After the dinner at the end of the lunar year last year, a surplus of 190 yuan and 70 cents was left over. After public discussion, it was decided that the association would use the round sum of 190 yuan to purchase two complete books of the 19th Aviation Lottery from the Da Yun Company and distribute them by drawing lots to add to the fun. This time, the first prize was won by a Mr. Tang, the 62-year-old secretary of the association. In addition, Mr. Lu, the general affairs officer, and Mr. Zhu, a member of the association, each won upper and lower linked attached prizes. Also, the second prizes, numbers 217002 and 217498, were sold by the Wenfei Company in Chongqing. The Huiliyuan store in Dongxinqiao in this city also sold two second prizes and one prize with number 51493. It has been confirmed that the winner of four tickets was Mr. Liu Zhitian of Yangshupu in this city, and the winner of one ticket was Mr. Wang Xinglong of Tangqiao Township, Pudong. In addition, two third prizes were mailed to Mr. Wei of the Osaka Sanyi Association, and three tickets were mailed to Mr. Dong of Weihaiwei. The prize money for the above winners has all been fully collected. Many third prizes were also sold in various batches by Daliyuan on Simalu Road, Dafulai on Xinqiao Street, and various sales stores. According to the Da Yun Company executive, the nominal amount of the aviation lottery is 3 million yuan, and the sales of this company alone reached more than 1.8 million yuan, accounting for two-thirds of the total sales. Therefore, there is a reason why the big prizes often come to the Da Yun Company. More than 1.5 million yuan of the 20th lottery has now been sold. It is expected that a few days before the draw, there will be a shortage of supply.</p>

It is now learned that the managers of the Shanghai Fuxing National Goods Company, such as Chen Zhonggao, and others, in order to ensure the perpetual maintenance of the national goods business, after the company's debts are finally repaid, have sought a relatively sound method after several designs, that is, to implement labor-capital cooperation. The company's forty-two departments are estimated in the most economical way and allocated to cooperate with the employees of each department, so that benefits are shared equally. This method has already been implemented and has achieved remarkable results, that is, the employees who were previously arrogant to customers have changed into polite personnel, so customers have praised the company's employees. Also, due to the labor cooperation relationship, the management and distribution of goods have achieved extremely economical and clean results. The future development of the company is promising.</p>

<h3>City Sounds</h3>
<p>The Grand Theater's performance of the Six Volumes of Journey to the West is a Grand Occasion. Since the premiere of the Six Volumes of Journey to the West at the Grand Theater on Ermalu Road, the performances have been popular. The plot is compact, the scenery is magnificent, the mechanisms are ingenious, and the seat prices are low. In addition, the combination of famous actors such as Zhang Yipeng, Chen Hefeng, Wang Yunfang, and Han Suqiu is quite appropriate. It can be said that they are a perfect match. As a result, every performance is sold out. Latecomers often express regret. The crowded and grand scene is unexpected. It is now learned that since the theater was taken over by Guixinji, the internal management has been further consolidated and improved. All receptionists and tea servants are strictly trained to ensure that they treat the audience attentively and serve thoughtfully in order to reciprocate the kindness of the patrons.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Regarding the news published in your esteemed newspaper on February 25th concerning a work slowdown at our factory, upon investigation, it does not align with the facts. Fearing this may mislead the public, we are writing to clarify the situation. We would be grateful if your newspaper could publish the following correction. The calculation of wages for workers in our factory is based on monthly, hourly, and piece-rate systems. Monthly wages are for long-term employees, hourly wages are for short-term employees, and piece-rate wages are for piece-work employees. This is determined based on the work conditions of each worker. This system has been in place since the factory was established and has not been altered in the slightest. Even if we wanted to change it, we are constrained by the realities of the situation. The claim that we recently switched to hourly calculations is entirely untrue. Furthermore, the minimum wage earned by workers each month is fourteen yuan. Diligent workers can earn over twenty yuan per month. If a worker is lazy and earns less, it is their own fault, not the fault of the factory. The claim that each worker earns only three or four yuan per month is also untrue. Upon investigation, the sudden work slowdown by our factory workers was instigated by agitators. They demanded the company accept conditions that had not been approved by party or government authorities, and when this was not met, they incited a full work stoppage to force our hand. The workers claimed the factory stopped providing raw materials as the reason for the second work slowdown, which is absurd. Since the beginning of spring, our factory has been doing well, and work has never been interrupted. Why would we voluntarily abandon business? Furthermore, after the first work slowdown, the workers resumed work after mediation and persuasion by Mr. Lu Yinchu, a representative of the city party headquarters. Their subsequent work stoppage is inconsistent and treats work slowdowns as a game, which is illegal. In addition to reporting this to party and government authorities for a lawful resolution, we are writing this letter to correct the record. We respectfully submit this to the Shenbao News Office. China Fuxin Tobacco Company, February 25th.</p>
<p>To the esteemed Mr. News Editor of the Shenbao News Office: Yesterday's local news section carried a story about a daughter privately arranging a marriage. This is not consistent with the facts, and we are making the following statement to set the record straight. Hui Fu is currently twenty-three years old, having reached the legal age of independence. She was formally engaged to Tu Weijun, who works at the Shanghai YMCA, on the second of this month. Mr. Shan Yinghui, a lawyer, has been engaged to publish a notice to confirm this. The claim that she is only nineteen and privately arranged a marriage is entirely false. Furthermore, she welcomed her mother to live with her in Pudong, but after someone sowed discord, she returned to Shanghai. However, to fulfill her filial duties, she still provides her mother with ten yuan per month for living expenses. Unexpectedly, the day before yesterday (February 24th) in the afternoon, she caused trouble at the Labor Elementary School where she works and engaged in physical assault. Under duress, she requested protection from the Public Security Bureau. After mediation, her monthly allowance for living expenses was increased by three yuan. This was out of kindness and not an obligation. Furthermore, her mother had two sons after remarrying, who are now adults and employed, fully capable of supporting her. The claim of stealing private writings is without evidence and is a fabrication. In addition to submitting a statement to the Public Security Bureau for the record to avoid further disputes, we are writing to request your newspaper to make a correction. Respectfully yours, Chen Hui Fu, February 25th, Correspondence Address: Shanghai Pudong YMCA Labor Elementary School</p>

<h3>The Tallow and Wax Industry in Shanghai (An Overview of Shanghai's Industry and Commerce - 15)</h3>
<p>— Edited by China Credit Information Service</p>
<p>1.  History: Tallow and wax is a general term for Chinese tallow, white wax, and paraffin wax. The tallow and wax industry in Shanghai has a long history. For thousands of years, the Chinese people have revered superstition, creating a high demand for candles made from Chinese tallow wax. In 1908, during the late Qing Dynasty, Mr. Yan Zhongshan of the Shanghai Dingfeng Soap Factory and Mr. Chen Hangfan of the Tingli Soap Factory invented the use of Chinese tallow oil in soap making, which then became an industrial raw material. However, at that time, there were very few large-scale soap factories that used Chinese tallow oil. Therefore, before the founding of the Republic of China, the Chinese tallow oil industry still relied on superstition for protection and depended entirely on retail sales for revenue. Since the founding of the Republic, beginning with the Guben Soap Factory in 1921 and the China Soap Company (British Xiangmao Soap Factory) in 1926, which began using Chinese tallow oil, the demand exceeded supply. The number of companies in the same industry gradually increased. In 1931, an unprecedented high price appeared on the market, which influenced the dumping of imported coconut oil and Japanese hardened oil (also known as fish oil). Consequently, sales of tallow soap were almost completely wiped out. In recent years, the price of tallow has dropped again, while the price of imported goods has increased, and sales of tallow are gradually recovering. According to a survey conducted in 1935, the total national tallow oil production was 750,000 dan. In addition to direct consumption, soap sales reached 200,000 dan. Shanghai's tallow oil consumption alone accounted for 92,000 dan. Therefore, this city also plays an important role in the Chinese tallow oil market. Based on the current tallow price, it is difficult for foreign goods to be imported, and the sales of tallow are promising and growing.</p>
<p>Chinese tallow oil and white wax are both unique products of China. In the past, exports to foreign companies were not weak. However, due to the limited uses of these products, they have declined to almost zero today. The decline in production and sales of white wax is particularly severe. Paraffin wax imports began only 30 years ago. The import volume has increased every year. In April 1934, Russian wax first arrived in Shanghai, and the market situation changed. The market has also become sluggish.</p>
<p>2.  Types and Origins of Tallow and Wax</p>
<p>Chinese tallow oil is also known as bark oil or white oil. The oil is extracted from the fruit of the Chinese tallow tree. There are many types and names, and the quality varies greatly. Generally, oil from Hubei and Hunan is transported to Shanghai via Hankou and is called "North Oil." Oil from Zhejiang and Anhui is transported to Shanghai via Hangzhou and is called "South Oil." The best oil is white and firm. Oil with a high water content is considered to be inferior. Heavy Jing Oil from Hubei, Jinshi Oil from Hunan, and Heben Oil from Zhejiang are all considered top grade. The most famous brands are Zhu Dashun of Heavy Jing, Wanzipai and Wuzipai of Heben, Yang Chunhe and Heng Yuan Da of Jiangxi Oil, and Wujiadian of Chaxue Oil, which are considered standard brands. In terms of production volume, Macheng Oil is the largest, and Xiang Oil is the smallest. A list of oil names, producing areas, and production volumes is as follows:</p>
<p>White wax is the secretion of wax insects on wax trees. The areas where wax insects and wax trees are produced are different. Wax insects are produced in Qianwei, Ya'an, and Huili, at the border of Sichuan and Yunnan. There are tens of thousands of people who make a living raising wax insects for hundreds of miles. Wax trees are produced in Jiading, Sichuan. During the Lesser Fullness season, the locals transfer the wax insects to the wax trees. The insects eat the wax leaves, and over time, their excrement accumulates and hardens. This is then refined and steamed to become white wax. According to a survey conducted in 1935, the production volume of Jiading Prefecture was 7,000 dan, that of Xuzhou Prefecture was 6,400 dan, and that of Dongchuan, Yunnan, was 2,400 dan, totaling 15,800 dan. Sichuan Province has the highest production volume. The goods can be divided into two types: rice core and general cargo. Rice core is white and firm, while general cargo is bright and loose. The unit is a branch, with eight cakes per branch. The larger cakes weigh 38 jin (city weight) and the smaller ones weigh 19 jin (city weight). The Tianzenggong brand of general cargo and the Qingshenyong brand of rice core are considered the best.</p>
<p>Paraffin wax is also known as mineral wax. It is a byproduct of kerosene, commonly known as petroleum jelly. There are fully refined and semi-refined types, as well as grades of 110, 115, 120, 125, 130, 135, and 140 degrees. The higher the grade, the better the quality. Grades above 135 degrees can be used as raw materials for cosmetics. Candle factories usually use 125-degree goods. The lowest grades are most commonly used by match factories. It is imported from overseas in wooden barrels or burlap sacks. The capacity of the barrels ranges from 350 jin to 400 jin, and the capacity of the burlap sacks ranges from 100 jin to 170 jin. Mobil and Asiatic sell fully refined goods. American goods are mostly semi-refined. Russian goods are all semi-refined. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Western YMCA Women's Basketball Tournament, Few Registrations Still, Deeply Hope Chinese and Western Teams Participate Enthusiastically, Otherwise It Will Be Difficult to Hold and May Be Cancelled</h3>
<p>The Western YMCA in this city, after the conclusion of the men's basketball league, prepared a women's basketball league. Because they adopted men's rules, few teams participated, and the meeting decided to cancel the tournament. Subsequently, the Shanghai Women's Basketball Association requested that it be held again. After a second decision by the association's sports committee, the previous decision was cancelled, and the women's rules were adopted to continue preparations. Letters were sent to Chinese and Western teams inviting them to participate. However, since the registration began, only the Dongya and Anli teams have joined so far. There are still several days left until the registration deadline. It is hoped that Chinese and Western teams will participate enthusiastically to support the event. Otherwise, with only two teams, it will be difficult to hold the tournament, and it may be cancelled again.</p>

He reported the process to Wang Shijie.</p>
<h3>General Education Situation in Hubei Province in the Past Two Years</h3>
<p>Hubei Province's education was extremely dilapidated in the past due to natural disasters and man-made calamities. Since Commissioner Cheng Zhichiu took office in July of the 22nd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1933], he has strived to reorganize it. After two years of arduous efforts, it is now on track. The following is a summary of the general situation of education at all levels in the province in the past two years.</p>
<p>Education Funding: Since receiving all schools in Hankou City in July of the 20th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1931], the province's education funding, including provincial schools and libraries, reached more than 330,000 yuan per month. In February of the 21st year [of the Republic, i.e., 1932], due to financial difficulties, it was reduced to more than 290,000 yuan. By October of the 21st year, due to the province's insufficient treasury, schools and libraries were closed and merged, and the funding was reduced again. The schools in Hankou City were transferred to the Hankou Municipal Government for management, with a total monthly expenditure of more than 190,000 yuan. By November, it was reduced for the third time, with a monthly expenditure of more than 160,000 yuan. In the 22nd and 23rd years [of the Republic, i.e., 1933 and 1934], to meet the actual needs, the estimated amount was set at more than 170,000 yuan. Including Hankou City's education funding, the annual estimated amount for education and culture in the province, excluding county and district education funding, was 2,650,569 yuan. Excluding Hankou City's education funding, the province's education and culture expenditure for the 23rd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1934] was 2,329,634 yuan (distributed as follows: 134,418 yuan for educational administration, 320,424 yuan for compulsory education, 210,485 yuan for higher education, 927,608 yuan for secondary education, 446,400 yuan for primary schools, 105,502 yuan for social education and cultural undertakings, 64,448 yuan for subsidies and grants, 120,000 yuan for expanding education, and 9,348 yuan for the Office of the Special Commissioner for Education in Western Hubei). All these figures are increased compared to previous years (2,135,172 yuan in the 21st year [of the Republic, i.e., 1932] and 2,186,286 yuan in the 22nd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1933]). The finances of Hubei Province have been affected by years of rampant banditry and communism, which has impacted tax revenues. Even in the first quarter of the 20th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1931], although it was not abundant, expenditures could still be paid in full each month according to the budget. Since the autumn of that year, due to flooding in the Han River and a decrease in treasury revenue, monthly funding could not be issued on time. Fortunately, starting from November of the 21st year [of the Republic, i.e., 1932], after implementing three measures of cutting and merging, revenue and expenditure matched, and monthly funding could be issued twice a month, in the first and second halves of the month. In the past, the accumulated debt to provincial schools and libraries and the funding for studying abroad, which several previous administrations had failed to repay, totaling a huge sum of one million yuan, was actually repaid successively within a year. In the 23rd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1934], the educational undertakings of the province could be promoted to the fullest extent, which was undoubtedly assisted by the fundraising and repayment of accumulated debts. It can also be seen that the educational administration authorities have put in a great deal of effort.</p>
<p>Higher Education: The selection and dispatch of government-funded students to study abroad in our country began in the 11th year of Tongzhi in the Qing Dynasty. The province's government-funded study abroad began in the 25th year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty, when Zhang Zhidong presided over Hubei's administration. By the 30th year of Guangxu, the number of students sent abroad had reached more than 400. After the establishment of the Republic of China, Li Ming Huangpi supervised Hubei and used revolutionary merits as the standard for sending students abroad. All those who had made meritorious contributions and were talented were sent abroad. Later, in Japan, the standard for selecting and granting government funding was to be admitted to Imperial University, Commercial and Industrial College, Higher Normal School, and the First to Eighth Higher Schools, as well as the Meiji Five Special Schools. Starting from the 6th year of the Republic [i.e., 1917], examinations were used. First, the provincial government held a preliminary examination, and then the Ministry of Education held a re-examination to make a decision. From the 17th to the 22nd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1928 to 1933], two types of selection and supplementation were carried out simultaneously. The examination was held domestically. Examinations were held in the 17th, 19th, and 20th years [of the Republic, i.e., 1928, 1930, and 1931], all presided over by the Department of Education, without the need for a re-examination by the Ministry. The supplementation was carried out among self-funded students already studying abroad. From the 17th year to the first semester of the 22nd year, supplementation was carried out whenever there were vacancies. Therefore, most of the government-funded students studying abroad at that time were supplemented. In April of the 22nd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1933], after the Ministry of Education announced the regulations for studying abroad, the department also revised the regulations for studying abroad and submitted them for approval and implementation. The department, in order to reorganize the funding for studying abroad, in addition to raising funds to repay the previous debts so that government-funded students abroad could study with peace of mind and facilitate assessment, checked that the budget for studying abroad in the 22nd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1933] was 16,790.40 yuan per month, compiled according to the 90% discount after November of the 21st year [of the Republic, i.e., 1932], and the Department of Finance transferred it to the Department of Education each month for remittance to the students. The 23rd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1934] was also compiled according to the 22nd year, with a total annual amount of 201,485.4 yuan, divided into two sections: government-funded students and scholarships for self-funded students. The former received an annual payment of 173,621 yuan, and the latter received an annual payment of 27,864 yuan. In addition, there were temporary expenses for studying abroad, which referred to the expenses for government-funded students' departure, return, travel expenses, medical treatment, compensation, and relief. The annual amount listed in the 23rd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1934] was 1,030 yuan. In order to ensure the stability of the lives of students studying abroad and encourage them to pursue further studies, the department first issued three months' tuition fees to the students who had initially decided to go abroad, and then remitted the fees in advance on a monthly basis from the fourth month onwards. At the same time, it strictly examined their academic performance in order to avoid wasting public funds. According to the latest survey and statistics in the province, there were eight government-funded students in Japan, ten in Germany, three in Belgium, four in England, four in the United States, and one in France. The selection of scholarship students for self-funded study abroad, starting from the 23rd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1934], was carried out by the Department of Education, which appointed Wang Xinggong, Chen Shi, Huang Pu, Jiang Qi, Song Xueting, He Qingming, Gao Qi, and others as review committee members. Ten students, including Wang Zhenhuan, who passed the review, received monthly scholarships ranging from 100 German marks or 30 US dollars to 530 French francs.</p>
<p>Secondary Education: The main points of the secondary education administration in the province in the 22nd and 23rd years [of the Republic, i.e., 1933 and 1934] concerning schools were: holding a provincial conference of secondary school principals, adding simplified normal school courses in Western Hubei and Northern Hubei, expanding the provincial second rural normal school class, deciding to expand vocational school classes and vocational education (the vocational education fee in the 21st year [of the Republic, i.e., 1932] was 235,197 yuan, which increased to 396,590 yuan in the 22nd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1933], and increased to 425,220 yuan in the 23rd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1934], with the goal of reaching the standards set by the Ministry of Education by the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1937]), urging the establishment of agricultural and forestry experiment schools and agricultural and forestry training classes in each administrative commissioner district, ordering all counties to prepare for the establishment of junior vocational schools, reorganizing general secondary schools, developing secondary education in outer districts, and increasing classes so that secondary education in the provincial capital and outer districts, and boys' secondary education and girls' secondary education, could develop equally. Xiangyang Junior High School was added, and the affiliated junior agricultural school of the provincial education college was added in the old year, as well as the provincial second rural normal girls' vocational normal class and the provincial third rural normal girls' vocational class. Regarding faculty and staff, the focus was on reviewing qualifications, assessing performance, improving treatment, implementing guarantees, holding secondary school science, history, and geography seminars, and preparing for the certification of secondary normal school teachers. Regarding students, the focus was on reducing the burden on students (exempting tuition fees and book fees, and stipulating that the cost of uniforms should not exceed four yuan in winter and three yuan in summer, and the registration fee should not exceed five jiao. All miscellaneous fees, loss fees, and boarding fees not stipulated in the secondary school regulations were not allowed to be charged), setting up scholarships for poor students (40 high school students, 40 yuan per student per year; 120 junior high school students, 30 yuan per student per year), reviewing students' academic performance in each school, holding speech contests, holding graduation exams and regular spot checks, and strictly implementing junior high school scouting training and high school student training, etc.</p>
<p>Primary Education: The province's primary education was previously considered good by Zhong Daozan, section chief of the Ministry of Education's inspectorate, and Wu Yan Yin. The students' performance in the two subjects of Mandarin and labor was the best. The more important matters handled in the 22nd and 23rd years [of the Republic, i.e., 1933 and 1934] were: designating provincial Wuxue Primary School and other schools as central primary schools in Eastern Hubei, Western Hubei, and Northern Hubei, holding summer seminars for primary school teachers, ordering all primary schools to focus on labor classes to cultivate children's operating habits and production skills, reducing the burden on students in each primary school, and exempting tuition fees in provincial schools and adding restrictions to private schools, and setting up free places for more than one-third of students to help poor children), dividing the provincial Wuchang experimental district into junior primary school guidance districts, setting up guidance directors, and designating five schools to pilot the two-part system, establishing a provincial primary education research association and discussing primary education issues, adding classes to provincial primary schools and normal school-affiliated primary schools, and adding kindergartens and provincial compulsory education experimental districts, short-term primary schools, and simplified primary schools.</p>
<p>Local Education: In the past, education in Hubei Province inevitably emphasized the provincial capital and neglected local areas, with a vast difference in levels. After Commissioner Cheng's two years of determined reorganization and promotion, the larger matters were as follows: 1. Holding a provincial county and district education administration conference to properly plan the improvement of local education; 2. Implementing the Hubei Revival of Local Education Three-Year Plan to save the decline of local education; 3. Implementing the measures for revitalizing local education in Western Hubei in order to achieve the average development of education in Western Hubei and all counties in Hubei; 4. Reviewing and certifying primary school teachers, eliminating the inferior and reusing normal school graduates to improve the content of local schools; 5. Registering county supervisors to carefully select local education inspectors and guides; 6. Formulating the regulations of the Hubei County Private School Teacher Certification Committee and the regulations of the Private School Teacher Summer Training Class to certify and train private school teachers and improve private schools; 7. Formulating the Hubei Regulations on Rewarding Donations to Schools to reward private individuals and private groups for establishing schools; 8. Formulating the Hubei Regulations on the Retirement of Education Administrative Personnel to encourage education administrative personnel and promote the advancement of local education; 9. Merging all non-abolished education bureaus into the third section of the county government and temporarily approving the collection of education surcharges according to the existing plan to save administrative expenses, expand local education undertakings, and maintain existing local education matters without interruption; 10. Formulating the Hubei Outline of Measures for Implementing the Integration of Politics and Education and Popularizing Education and the Measures for Establishing Primary Schools by Joint Guarantee in Each County to seek the active development of local education and the coordinated progress of politics and education. Except for the tenth item, which only began to be implemented in June of the 24th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1935], the remaining items have all had considerable results. Taking only primary education as an example, according to the latest survey, there are a total of 4,300 primary schools and junior primary schools in each county of the province, with 1,200 added in the 22nd and 23rd years [of the Republic, i.e., 1933 and 1934], accounting for about one-third of the total number. This shows that local education has shown signs of revival after two years of management, which shows the efforts of the provincial education administration authorities.</p>
<p>In addition, the province has adopted special education for adults, children, and adult women in the recovered bandit areas, widely established mass schools and mass education halls, agricultural education halls, and adopted mobile teaching and traveling lecture methods, improved mass entertainment and customs, and universally implemented physical education, rectified the academic atmosphere, and promoted academic research. There are many such undertakings with remarkable achievements. Due to space limitations, they are all omitted.</p>

<h3>Financials: Gold Bar Market Experiences Rebound, Recovering One Yuan From Previous Decline</h3>

<h3>New York Stock Market: Most Speculators Bullish</h3>
<p>New Fung Yang &amp; Co. reports that the New York stock market yesterday (the 24th) was mixed and weak. Trading volume was one of the lightest of the month. However, leading stocks and sectors showed no pressure. Among these, US Steel, Chrysler Motors, and New York Central Railroad were generally stable. Some lower-priced stocks were relatively active. Packard Motors' trading was acceptable. Railway equipment stocks rebounded at the end of the day due to increased railway orders. Railroad stocks were quiet. Sugar stocks bucked the general market trend and rose. Food stocks were in good demand. Liquor stocks were firm. Automobile stocks were generally lower. Most speculators feel that the long-term outlook remains bullish, as railway revenues are gradually recovering, and steel mills' operations are maintaining levels due to purchases from the railway and construction industries. Also, the weather is gradually warming. Small exchange stocks were mixed. The bond market was lower. Total trading volume for the day was 2.2 million shares. The Dow Jones New York indices are listed on the left:</p>
<h3>Yarn &amp; Cotton: Good Yarn Sales Trigger Short Covering</h3>
<p>The yarn market fell in the morning but rebounded in the afternoon. The situation was calm, but overseas yarn and cotton conditions consistently pointed downward, causing market sentiment to suffer. In the afternoon, the market rebounded because spot yarn sales remained maintainable and Japanese yarn prices trended upward. Foreign firms' price negotiations were tight.</p>
<p>Yarn Futures: Initial Decline Followed by Rebound. The opening market for yarn futures saw weakness and sluggishness in all months. Market sentiment was fragile due to the consistent decline in international yarn and cotton prices. There was a lack of buyers in the market. By the third session, news of Osaka's Sanpin yarn steadily declining caused frustration in the market. As a result, all months fell by 0.7 to 1 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The market price slowly increased after the afternoon opening. Spot yarn sales were still good, and Japanese yarn prices trended upward. Spot goods were tight, and retail investors covered short positions, resulting in a high rebound. As a result, all months increased by 0.4 to 0.7 yuan compared to the morning closing price. 450 bales of Geng Feng were sold, 300 bales of Chang Yu were sold, 350 bales of Yi Da were sold, 700 bales of Yong Da were sold, 600 bales of Heng Yi were sold, 600 bales of Rui Da were sold, 600 bales of Heng Chang were sold, and 450 bales of Da Chang were sold. 750 bales of Ji Feng were purchased, 450 bales of Da Fu were purchased, 350 bales of Da Feng were purchased, 650 bales of Sen Kang were purchased, 800 bales of Da Chang Cheng were purchased, 550 bales of Yong Chang were purchased, 700 bales of Ju Xing were purchased, 600 bales of He Xing were purchased, 600 bales of Feng were purchased, and 400 bales of Shen Chang were purchased. The daily high, low, and closing prices are listed below.</p>
<p>Sichuan and Tianjin Merchants Actively Procuring Spot Yarn with Immediate Payment. Sichuan and Tianjin merchants purchased the most. The total number of transactions for the day was 1,920 bales, with prices up 0.5 yuan. The purchase amount for each group is listed below:</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Weak</h3>
<p>The cotton market was sluggish due to a consistent decline in Indian and American cotton markets. The gold bar market was weak, further weakening market sentiment. Rumors that Indian cotton (16-count raw material) was sold at 48.5 yuan for 8,000 bales were rampant. As a result, the cotton market became even weaker. However, this event still needs to be confirmed.</p>
<p>Cotton Futures Fell by 0.3 to 0.4 Yuan. The opening market for cotton futures saw declines because American cotton long positions were closed, falling by 8,000 to 15 pounds. Indian cotton long positions were closed, with futures sold at high prices, falling by 0.75 to 2 rupees and a half. Osaka's Sanpin cotton fell by .3 cents. Market sentiment turned weak. However, the delivery of February contracts the previous day was very tight. Today, it was weakened by the pressure of foreign cotton. As a result, all months fell by 0.3 to 0.5 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The market was still rising after the afternoon opening. However, there were rumors in the market of a large batch of Indian cotton being sold, specifically for 16-count raw material. After diligent investigation, the specific factory or firm responsible for the sale has not been identified. As a result, all months increased by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan compared to the morning closing price. 2,200 dan of Tong He were sold, 2,100 dan of Run Kang were sold, 1,200 dan of Geng Feng were sold, 1,100 dan of Yuan Xing Chang were sold, 1,000 dan of Ji Feng were sold, 1,300 dan of Shen Chang were sold, 1,000 dan of Ren Feng were sold, 1,500 dan of Xin Cheng were sold, and 1,200 dan of Yi Kang were sold. 2,300 dan of He Xing were purchased, 1,500 dan of Zhen Da were purchased, 2,000 dan of Rui Da were purchased, 1,300 dan of Da Chang Cheng were purchased, 1,300 dan of Yong Chang were purchased, 1,800 dan of Chang He were purchased, 1,800 dan of Rui Yuan were purchased, 1,800 dan of Sen Kang were purchased, and 1,200 dan of Yuan Yi were purchased. The daily high, low, and closing prices are listed below.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton: Manufacturers Cautious. Spot cotton consumption was slightly lower. Because Indian cotton has been declining recently, manufacturers are being cautious.</p>
<h3>National Cotton Bureau Continues to Sell: US Cotton Consistently Declines in All Months</h3>
<p>US cotton opened yesterday, with poor news from Liverpool. March contracts were unwound, with foreign firms selling and rushing to sell. Some moved positions from March to distant months. All months fell by 2 to 11 pounds. Subsequently, near months slightly rebounded with purchases from peers and spot traders. There was a lack of outside trading. Peers awaited developments in Washington. The National Cotton Bureau continued to sell spot cotton, but the government did not sell forward cotton. The close was flat and weak, with spot cotton falling by 10 basis points and futures falling by 8 to 13 basis points. English cotton spot fell by 7 points and futures fell by 6 to 7 points. Indian cotton futures traders sold and unwound long positions. Some Japanese firms cross-bought. The result was that both Pingguo and Liang fell by 0.25 to 0.75 rupees, Omla fell by 2 to 2.5 rupees, and Bairochi fell by 1.5 to 2 rupees. The telegram records are on the left (telegram from the 24th).</p>
<p>Also, according to the Bombay telegram, the opening forecast for Bairochi cotton on the 25th was 191 rupees, down 0.25 rupees from the previous day's close.</p>
<p>Sanpin Yarn and Cotton Slight Decline</p>
<p>Osaka telegram on the 25th: Sanpin yarn futures fell by 0.3 to 0.8 yuan. Near-month was 188.3 yuan, and distant-month was 188.1 yuan. Cotton futures fell by 0.05 to 0.2 yuan. Near-month was 60.45 yuan, and distant-month was 58.2 yuan.</p>
<h3>Grains: Continuous Spring Snow Causes Wheat Flour Prices to Soar - Foreign Wheat also Affected by Bad Weather</h3>
<p>The flour market, after opening in the morning, saw further stable signs. Foreign wheat quotations from Chicago and Canada were up by around 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. Domestic weather saw snow again, causing both insiders and outsiders to have bullish sentiment. Near-term actual sales were slightly slower, but inland groups absorbed distant-term contracts, leading to further increases of around 0.1 to 0.2 yuan in all months. The market initially remained stable after opening in the afternoon, and distant months even rose further by a few cents. Subsequently, customer groups like Yingkou and others gradually sold off long positions, and factories also engaged in spread trading, causing the market to become sluggish. It is feared that the poor weather conditions will make it difficult for prices to fall.</p>
<p>The wheat market was affected by unfavorable weather and foreign wheat also slightly improved. Opening prices in all months were stable. The near-term market was not active after the afternoon opening, but distant-term trading was very lively. New wheat for June and July could not be expected to be low due to the weather. However, in terms of market value, it was larger than in previous years, so distant customers sold off, limiting the rise in the market. Spot wheat market transactions were not high, and prices were stable. Shandong wheat opened at 5.25 yuan, and Chuzhou wheat opened at 5.03 yuan. Fuxin sold 400 bales, and Shen Da sold 500 bales.</p>
<p>Chicago wheat rose due to dust storms in the southwest and improved flour demand, causing foreign markets to be firm and prices to rise. However, with Canada's wheat surplus piled high, it would be difficult for prices to rise significantly. Weekly estimates show a decrease in supply of 2,479,000 bushels and a decrease in Canadian wheat of 5,111,000 bushels.</p>
<h3>Rice Sales Improve Significantly - Jiangxi Rice Production Reports Price Increases</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday's supplies from various groups only reached the 25th (totaling over 5,000 shi). Sales were similar to inventory, so the market was flat. Early polished rice prices remained unchanged. Thin rice from Yantai and other groups sold over 2,000 bales, and the market was also unchanged. Du Yang sharp rice and Yin Bian Yuan market were also stable.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday's supplies from Heshui were from the 32nd and 33rd. Sales of various goods were normal. White polished rice became active, and market prices were tightly discounted by a few cents. Thin rice sales were normal, and the market was stable. Lamb sharp rice was firm, and Du sharp rice was stable. Port customers' sharp rice sales were slightly active, and market prices slightly increased by a few cents. Prices for all other goods were stable. Although there was some trading, sales were limited due to continuous rain.</p>
<p>(Customer Rice) The market continued to improve yesterday. Because supplies from various places decreased, and sales from local warehouses continued to be active, the market saw an upward trend. Production areas reported the best market in Jiujiang, where yesterday's telegrams reported price increases of around half a yuan. This was because there was a large amount of sales due to military needs and public works projects, and existing inventory was exhausted. The high market price in the area made it difficult to profitably ship to Shanghai. As a result, traders were generally optimistic. Although there was no active trading between inland areas and various customer groups yesterday, prices still increased by 0.05 to 0.06 yuan. 5,170 bales of Jiangxi rice, 800 bales of Hunan rice, 500 bales of Taiwan indica rice, 205 bales of Hanzhou raw rice, and 120 bales of Anqing machine-polished rice were traded, with most going into warehouses. Actual inventory on the street accounted for a small number.</p>
<p>(Foreign Rice) Sales had not been active for a long time due to the influence of customer indica rice. Traders were unwilling to reduce prices and sell off. A batch of newly arrived Siamese rice was well-received by the Tianjin group. 4,463 bales were opened for sale, with high prices at 9.54 yuan, settling at 8.39 yuan.</p>
<h3>Soybean Oil Suffers from Continuous Declines in Telegrams, Local Oil Factories Unwilling to Sell Cheaply, Dalian Market Sees Rebound</h3>
<p>In the soybean oil market, because soybean prices were not low, most oil factories were unwilling to sell cheaply. Only merchants sold 50 pieces of oil from the Da You factory at a price of 18.1 yuan. All other prices fell by 0.35 yuan compared to the previous market. 300 pieces of Dalian oil were opened for sale at a price of 17.8 yuan, 200 pieces of Su Qi oil at a price of 17.7 yuan, and 100 pieces of Qing Qi oil from sand boats at a price of 17.25 yuan. Because the Dalian morning market continued to report declines, the market sentiment in Shanghai was inevitably affected, and market prices fell. However, the closing price in Dalian was better than the previous day, so the Shanghai oil market may rebound today.</p>
<p>In the standard soybean cake market, the market sentiment was panicked due to the repeated small rebounds in the Dalian market. Oil cake and beans fell across the board after the morning opening. There were some short covering transactions after the afternoon opening. According to private telegrams received by customers in Dalian, there were attempts to reverse the market in the future. Therefore, some firms took advantage of the low prices to buy. Because the number of standard beans arriving in Hankou has been low recently, the spot beans are scarce and sales are active, and the market has been in a holding pattern for a long time, the market atmosphere has changed again. Because standard beans for the current month are being actively short-covered for delivery at the end of the month, the market reached 5 yuan, an increase of 0.12 to 0.13 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price and the day's low price. Distant months increased by 0.06 to 0.08 yuan. The standard oil price was unchanged for the current month, and prices were higher for other months by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Refined Sugar Arrivals and Inventory are Scarce</h3>
<p>The sugar market trended weak as continuous spring rain and snow made sales difficult. The guild's price quotation for No. 24 Dutch raw white spot goods was 22.35 yuan, and for re-export goods it was 7.25 yuan. There were some transactions, but all were down 0.05 yuan from the previous day. The quotation for No. 8 Dongtang white spot goods was 21 yuan, and for re-export it was 7 yuan, with some sales, down slightly by 0.025 yuan. All other quotations remained at the original price without success. The quotation for locally produced cotton white Zhenji No. 1 was 21.1 yuan, and numbers 2, 3, 4, and 5 were sold at discounts. Sales of clear and red sugar were lacking. Both parties watched and held back, making a decline in the future difficult to avoid. Refined sugar arrivals have been limited in recent days, and the quantity is very scarce. There were fewer than 200 boxes of Five Blessings, Jade Spring, Lion Ball and other brands. Inventory was tight. The market wanted to raise prices, but because raw white sugar was declining, it was difficult to raise prices immediately. Five Blessings refined sugar was still opened for sale yesterday at the original price of 18.6 yuan, but it was possible to raise the price of total sugar, since the inventory was even more limited.</p>
<h3>Dried and Prepared Goods: Supplies of Miscellaneous Dried Longans are Becoming Increasingly Scarce</h3>
<p>For miscellaneous dried longans, the Taiyuan ship imported goods like those from Tong An and Stone Docks yesterday, totaling only 55 pieces. And the Huaping ship from Quanzhou should arrive in Shanghai within days, but according to telegrams from the owners, because of the high land price, there were no further shipments. So no boxes from Quanzhou were ever shipped. The scarcity of goods can be seen from this.</p>
<p>Longkou Noodles Fall 0.5 Yuan</p>
<p>The dry production price of Longkou noodles used to be 36.5 yuan (per bag) because of sourcing from both Shanghai and Ningbo. The price has recently fallen almost 1 yuan, so the market in Shanghai has also loosened. The quotation for the market yesterday was 25 yuan, down 0.5 yuan, and since sales are decreasing, the trend is still weak. Further small decreases are possible.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Gongxi Green Tea Sees Some Sales</h3>
<p>The green tea market has been very quiet recently. Two roads of Zhenmei green tea (both from local plantations and from out of town) face low prices from Morocco, which lead Chinese merchants to lose too much money. The market is impossible to develop. But 300+ cases of Gongxi green tea were bought by Baitouzhuang, Meixing Yulong and other firms yesterday, which were sold by Yilong and other tea warehouses. The market quotation opened at 15-16 yuan, similar to before. Besides this, Fujian merchants also had sporadic sales of shows, eyebrows, tips, etc.</p>
<h3>Metals: Prime Grade Tinplate in Short Supply</h3>
<p>Prime grade tinplate, regardless of whether it's 90 lbs, 100 lbs, 180 lbs, or 200 lbs, has recently experienced a sudden shortage of readily available stock on the market. Due to the demand exceeding the supply, prices have risen sharply. For example, 90 lb English tinplate is opening at $17.50, American at $19.50; 100 lb English is opening at $18.50, American at $21.00; 180 lb English is opening at $37.00, French at $35.00, German at $37.50, Italian at $38.00, American at $40.00; 200 lb English is opening at $39.00, French at $37.00, German at $39.50, Italian at $41.00, American at $50.00. Printing factories, canneries, paint companies, and cigarette companies are all absorbing the supply, resulting in lively transactions in the market. However, the source of supply is very limited, so the future price trend is still viewed optimistically.</p>

<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Microorganism)</p>
<p>If the cook draws water from the well, and the water-drawing tools are incomplete, with only a bucket but no bucket rope, how can the well water be drawn ashore to cook and prepare meals? Therefore, when drinking water, one should remember the source. We cannot but give credit to the bucket rope for its drawing power. Nowadays, when people are unemployed, they ask others for help to be raised up, speaking flowery and delightful words, absolutely not forgetting the kindness of the support. But once they are placed in a position, or later develop a little, they look down upon everything, not even putting the person who helped them in the past in their eyes. Such ungrateful friends are everywhere in the world. One must know, when eating rice, don't forget the farmer!</p>
<p>Furthermore, sometimes the bucket rope is very thick and strong, originally capable of drawing up a lot, but what is used is a broken bucket with holes. Then it is terrible, a full bucket of water drawn up will undoubtedly leak half of it, or all of it. This cannot be blamed on the bucket rope's ineffectiveness, but should be attributed to the bucket's own worthlessness. Therefore, promotion - assistance, also needs to be accurate. Help if it is worth it, otherwise, acting arbitrarily, you might waste your effort!</p>
<h3>Sentries of Outer Mongolia</h3>
<p>— Zi Ying</p>
<p>At a time when Japanese-Soviet relations are extremely tense, with war a distinct possibility, the conflict in Manchuria and Mongolia, which is the outpost of these two major powers, is becoming increasingly acute. Here, we probably all feel the allure of Outer Mongolia's border defenses.</p>
<p>I have a friend who used to do business in the Chahar-Suiyuan area. Recently, due to the rampant "bandits," he packed up and returned south. He told me a story about Outer Mongolian sentries. Now I will write it down, the following are his words:</p>
<p>"Three years ago, it was late summer and early autumn. Encouraged by friends, for the sake of a little profit, I disregarded all difficulties and dangers and resolved to sneak into Outer Mongolia.</p>
<p>"The weather outside the Great Wall is very bad, especially in the desert. During the day, the sun burns people like a ball of fire, and the temperature is often above ninety degrees. But at night, it is terribly cold, and you must cover yourself with two layers of felt. We traveled in such desolate wilderness, having crossed the boundless desert for five days. We had reached the border of Outer Mongolia, and still hadn't seen a single person. We were celebrating the success of our smuggling, but the next day we were caught by their patrol sentries.</p>
<p>"As I said just now, the border of Outer Mongolia is a desert. Their sentries patrol using this desert. They all ride fine horses, galloping back and forth. They drag a leafy branch behind the horse. When the horse runs, the leaves drag on the ground, making the desert very smooth. People walking on the sand are bound to leave tracks, and they follow the tracks. Nine times out of ten, they catch someone.</p>
<p>"Have you all read the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, seen Zhang Yide fighting Cao Cao at Dangyang Bridge? Didn't he order his soldiers to tie branches to the horses and gallop through the woods, making dust fly into the sky, as a ruse? I didn't expect the Outer Mongolian patrol sentries to also use these leaves."</p>
<p>"At first, they thought we were spies and guarded us very closely. But the food and lodging were very good. Later, when they learned that we were all merchants, they escorted us out of the country."</p>
<h3>The Beginning of Establishing Schools to Teach English</h3>
<p>— Yi Mei</p>
<p>Shanghai is a major trading port. European ships come from the east, and trade is prosperous. Chinese people have set up schools to teach English, and young people flock to them. Although English has now been included as a major subject in schools, and everyone can study it, the advertisements for English cram schools are still conspicuous in the streets. Examining its beginnings, it was in the first month of the second year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty. At that time, everyone in the country considered discussing foreign affairs to be fashionable. Li Shaoquan (Li Hongzhang) was considered to be one who knew foreign affairs well, and he established the so-called Foreign Languages Institute in Shanghai. At the time, there was a memorial to the throne, which said: "I humbly believe that when China interacts with foreigners, it must first understand their intentions, communicate their meanings, and know their truthfulness and falsehoods, and then can there be an effective application of appropriate measures. Among our officials and gentry, very few are proficient in foreign languages. Each country in Shanghai has established one or two translators. When Chinese and foreign ministers meet to discuss matters, they all rely on foreign translators to convey the information, and it is difficult to guarantee that there will be no bias or fabrication. Chinese people who are proficient in foreign languages rely only on interpreters. When dealing with foreign affairs, the weight, tone, and urgency of the words are often lost in the original intent. They only know how to use the power of foreigners to play tricks and instigate disputes for their own benefit. Foreign affairs are an important policy for the country to cherish and attract distant people, but entrusting the key to the hands of such people leads to not knowing the other party and not distinguishing between truth and falsehood. Manipulating advances and retreats, they never get to the point. This is no small matter. Shanghai and Guangdong are the places where foreigners gather the most. I humbly propose that we follow the example of the Tongwen Guan in Beijing and add a Foreign Languages Institute in Shanghai. Select literate children under the age of fourteen from nearby counties, who are intelligent and of good character, and hire Westerners to teach them. After three or five years, we will have people who are educated and reasonable, proficient in foreign languages. For the offices of the trading commissioners and governors, and the customs superintendents, we should add translators, and those who handle foreign affairs should be selected from the institute," etc. The original text is very long, this is a summary of it.</p>

<h3>Chess Talk</h3>
<p>— Yang Yu Sheng</p>
<p>Lately, I haven't talked about romance for a long time, but I play Weiqi every night, and I even have the spare time to write this chess talk for this publication. I can truly be considered to be "in between classes"!</p>
<p>Confucius once said: "The gentleman does not contend over anything, only his heart is focused on archery." Even with the morality and cultivation of a gentleman, he cannot be free from contention. So, if we have disputes or even quarrels because of playing chess, it is not surprising from a gentleman's point of view!</p>
<p>People often play Chinese chess in barbershops, so they add the word "stinky" to "Chinese chess", calling it "stinky Chinese chess." But according to Chinese historical records, Xie An, the "patriarch of pure conversation," was still calmly playing Weiqi when his nephews were "killing bandits and establishing merit" at the Fei River. Even the two star lords of the North and South Poles also play Weiqi in their spare time. The fact that Chinese chess is not valued by the literati or even the celestial realm has a long history!</p>
<p>Recently, someone told me an anecdotal joke: It is said that in one place, two people were playing Weiqi upstairs, and a lot of people were gathered downstairs playing Chinese chess. The latter often quarreled, making all sorts of unpleasant noises due to disputes. Therefore, one bystander sighed and said, "Playing Weiqi is really elegant. Listen, have you heard any noise upstairs? Only you playing stinky Chinese chess would make such a loud and nasty racket!" Later, "when the time was up," the Chinese chess game was declared over, but the two people upstairs were not seen coming down. So, someone ran upstairs to check. It turned out that they were desperately gripping each other's throats, fighting to the death!</p>
<p>We won't discuss whether this joke is me teasing the people who play Weiqi. Just speaking in terms of "human nature," the more knowledge people have, the bigger and more fierce their conflicts will be! The "rotten talk" that "the gentleman does not contend" is "this road is blocked" in the 20th century!</p>
<h3>Notes on What I Saw</h3>
<p>— (Zhang Mengzhao)</p>
<p>Can it be considered folklore?</p>
<p>Once when using the toilet, I happened to see a limerick written in pencil on the partition wall, which was very interesting. I don't know who wrote it? The poem says:</p>
<p>A virgin is born beautiful,</p>
<p>With a pair of small feet,</p>
<p>She is thirty-three years old,</p>
<p>Do you want her or not?</p>
<p>Old People Under the Wheels</p>
<p>"The road is like a tiger's mouth, do not walk in the middle." Living in a city full of thorns, everyone knows and remembers these two sentences. But last Sunday afternoon at noon, I witnessed an old man being knocked down by a public bus driver. The old man was carrying rice, and the rice was scattered on the ground. Pitifully, he fell flat on his back, almost losing his life. Bystanders were indignant and chased after the bus, cursing wildly. But the driver knew he had caused trouble, and the bus drove even faster. Everyone was helpless and could only watch the old man groan and struggle to get up from the ground. This happened on Yangshupu Road near the Bund. The driver deliberately committed a mistake and sped away in a hurry. Is there really any reason to be found in Shanghai? This matter does not seem to be the fault of the elderly who are old and deaf.</p>
<h3>Little Western Heaven</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 24: Weighting Profit Over Beauty, a Laborer Reluctantly Gives Up Love; With High Aspirations and Healthy Legs, a Brave Man Ventures into the Wilderness</p>
<p>Zhiqian said you've been busy all morning and haven't even seen the newspaper, what have you been doing? Bei Hai looked at Zhang Jiefu and smiled: This matter... I'll report back later. Following this situation, Zhang Jiefu nodded and left. Zhiqian laughed: I already know what you were talking about. I was also having lunch over there just now and heard Old Jia's words. You are a bit silly, why did you refuse his contribution? Bei Hai blushed and said: Mr. Cheng heard it, this is a bit inappropriate. Zhiqian poured a cup of tea, stood at the corner of the table, held it in his hands, slowly drank it, his eyes looking at Bei Hai's face from the heat circle of the teacup, shaking his head with a smile: What you said is a bit inappropriate, maybe it's exactly appropriate. Bei Hai tilted his head to look back at Zhiqian, pressed his hands on his thighs, tapped his feet on the ground and smiled: Mr. Cheng thinks this matter is a bit possible. Zhiqian said: To be honest, Mr. Jia's purpose in marrying this Miss Zhu is only to have some temporary fun because life in the Little Western Heaven hotel is too lonely, he found Miss Zhu to accompany him. But for this little thing, it caused the women's world to attack him collectively. The loss of love is a small matter, but it has a huge impact on the cause he is carrying out in Xi'an. He represents the bank's investment here. If his reputation is ruined and things don't work out, it doesn't matter if he loses face in Xi'an, but when he returns to Shanghai and Nanjing, he will also lose face. This is closely related to the problem of livelihood. You must know that in this day and age, all problems have an economic background. Probably he first couldn't get by, inevitably his emotions were stirred up, and he quarreled with people. Afterwards, he thought about it carefully and realized that he couldn't spoil his livelihood for the sake of temporary courage, it's better to be patient and let Miss Zhu leave. Since this person can't hold on to it, why not have you as an introducer. You are grateful to him, maybe you will help him a little in selling land. After thinking it through, this is still beneficial to him, so he had those words. Zhiqian said the words while sipping tea, looking at Bei Hai, constantly deepening his smile on his face, as if he had already recalled it. Then he came over and patted Bei Hai on the shoulder and said: If you are willing to trust me and listen to me, I can let you lovers get married. (408)</p>

<h3>Potting Plum Cultivation Method (Middle)</h3>
<p>— Hu Chuyu</p>
<p>Watering: The amount of flowering in potted plums is greatly related to the appropriateness of watering. For ordinary cultivation of trees, it is advisable to water more. To produce more flowers, it cannot be neglected. If too little water is given, the flowers will wither, and the growth of the tree will also be affected. The four words "more fertilizer, less moisture" are the secret to producing more flowers. Originally, plums like sunny places and also like dry places. Every year from the beginning of budding in early April to before the plum rain season, apply fertilizer fully and use less water, which is to promote vigorous budding. The thickness of the leaves determines the flower buds. Thin leaves will not produce flowers. Plum leaves absorb a lot of water when they grow, and the soil in the pot is easy to dry. The water poured in the morning should be dry by the evening. If we see that the soil in the pot has turned white, we should water it. The number of times to water each day is once a day in spring and autumn, twice a day in midsummer, and once every few days in winter. If there is too much water, then the buds will fall off, and the branches will easily grow longer. (To prevent the branches from growing too long, the bud tips can be cut off)</p>
<p>The quality of plum blossom branches is determined before the plum rain season, and its flower buds are also fixed. Young trees should be made to flower more. At the end of March, the soil in the pot should be temporarily dried. Old trees should not do this. After the flower buds are fixed, the water should be used appropriately. After the leaves fall, the water absorption is less, and watering should be slow. As for the water used, well water and river water are the most suitable, tap water should not be used. Winter ice water is also not suitable because the temperature is too low. Usually, mild clean water should be used so as not to harm the roots.</p>
<p>The Place to Put the Plum</p>
<p>It should be placed in a ventilated and sunny place. If it is placed in a windless and semi-shady place, it will only cause the branches to grow, and the flower core will not be bright, and it will easily suffer from pests and diseases. In midsummer, do not put it in a semi-shady place, it can be exposed to the scorching sun. When the wind is strong, prevent the soft branches from shaking, or the friction between branches. If the planting is very dense, thin bamboo can be used to support it so that they do not touch. Also, during periods of prolonged rain, it should be moved under the eaves.</p>
<p>Pruning and Thin Wire</p>
<p>After flowering, the branches and leaves should be pruned. The new axes of young trees are easy to lengthen, and one or two buds can be left at the base of the new shoots, and the useless branches and leaves can be trimmed according to the posture of the buds. However, there are also cases where the excessively long new shoots are cut off in summer. Although new buds can grow on the cut branches, these buds will not produce flowers, so it is better not to cut them. The new buds of old trees, if they grow only two or three points long, do not need to be cut off. However, because the tender branches and old branches are juxtaposed, it looks very inelegant, so it is better to cut them off. When the plum branches reach the plum rain season, the branches are very soft, and the plum branches can be coiled with wire according to the desired appearance, but the wire should be wrapped in paper. To correct ancient branches, hemp can be wrapped on the branches and slowly corrected. If you want to carve words or paintings on the plum trunk, or treat bark cracks, that must be done in March of spring.</p>

<h3>Various Reasons for Prolonged Infertility After Marriage</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xiaohan</p>
<p>There are many reasons for prolonged infertility after marriage. From the vertical perspective, there are those that belong to the man and those that belong to the woman. From the horizontal perspective, there are physiological and pathological reasons. What I want to talk about today are the various pathological reasons on both the male and female sides.</p>
<p>Male venereal disease is the biggest reason for infertility. Those suffering from nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, or kidney weakness; or thin or withered semen; or cold or weak semen; or premature ejaculation; or incomplete development; or withered and weak condition, all of these are failures in fulfilling marital duties and cannot reproduce.</p>
<p>Female hidden diseases make pregnancy difficult, such as persistent leucorrhea, erosion, dampness, and itching; or irregular menstruation, too much or too little, before or after; or cold uterus and abdominal pain, making conception impossible. Because women's environment is bad, etiquette is binding, parents-in-law oppress from above, and husbands restrict from the side, it is very inconvenient to see a doctor and take medicine, so they have to hide it and keep it secret, procrastinating and delaying. A hundred diseases arise, and suffering increases repeatedly. The body becomes thin and weak, and beauty disappears. It is both pitiful and regrettable.</p>
<p>Male and female venereal diseases or hidden diseases are caused by lack and abnormality of endocrine in the gonads. General ordinary endocrine preparations or tonics cannot be effective. Only gonadal preparations can be effective for symptomatic treatment. The reports of clinical treatments by various famous doctors published in this journal can be used as a reference for those who are worried about having no offspring.</p>
<h3>(Doctor's Report) Treatment for Premature Ejaculation</h3>
<p>(Report by Dr. Wang Shiying) Patient Shi Ducheng married too early and engaged in excessive sexual activity, resulting in severe premature ejaculation. His body became weak day by day, and his spirit was exhausted. Last autumn, he was introduced by Mr. Ma Fuhua to seek treatment. After my instructions, he bought and took "Spermogen" from Zhengwei Pharmacy. After taking it for a month, his gonads regained their prosperity, his body was strong, his spirit was vigorous, and he announced that premature ejaculation was cured, as if he had been given a new life.</p>
<p>(Note) "Spermogen" is taken three times a day, two to four tablets each time, depending on the severity of the symptoms.</p>
<h3>(Doctor's Report) Medication for Nocturnal Emission and Insomnia</h3>
<p>(Report by Dr. Ren Guoxiang) Patient Wang Wenren committed masturbation when young, resulting in severe depletion, leading to relaxation of the vas deferens. He suffered from nocturnal emission and wet dreams, insomnia and forgetfulness, dizziness and back pain, causing indescribable pain. Last autumn, he came to me for treatment. In order to quickly cure him by treating both the symptoms and the root cause, I immediately instructed him to buy and take "Spermin Tablets" with the words "Schimitt's" on them from the Sino-French Pharmacy to strengthen his seminal barrier, and instructed him to take "Spermogen" to replenish sperm and strengthen the brain. Nocturnal emission was cured immediately, and all symptoms disappeared. He thanked me repeatedly and left.</p>
<h3>(Published as Received) Self-Treatment Experience for Leucorrhea and Stomach Pain</h3>
<p>(Letter from Mr. Zhou Guangtai) My wife and I have been suffering from illnesses for many years without treatment. (Omission) I suffered from stomach problems and could not stop taking medicine. My stomach was weak and weak, and it was difficult to recover. And my wife suffered from continuous leucorrhea and abdominal pain during menstruation. We tried almost all the medicines, but there was no improvement. Later, I read in this journal that a certain gentleman suffered from the same stomach problems as me, and a certain lady's hidden disease was similar to my wife's. So I copied down the names of four famous medicines she used, "Gastralgia Elixir", "Stomach Tonic", "Leucorrhea Remedy", and "Female Spermogen", and bought them from Taihe Pharmacy. I took them internally and used them externally according to the instructions. My wife's and my illnesses gradually improved and were cured. We owe our health and happiness today to the effectiveness of the famous medicines and to your publication's introduction of medical knowledge and benefiting the crowd.</p>
<h3>(Doctor's Report) A Case of Radical Cure for Kidney Atrophy</h3>
<p>(Report by Dr. Jia Zhizhong) Patient Chen Deming injured himself through masturbation and sexual activity, resulting in extreme atrophy of his gonads, leading to severe kidney atrophy. He had difficulty fulfilling his marital duties and was ridiculed by his wife. His body was weak, and a hundred diseases arose. He despaired of having children and suffered mentally. He repeatedly tried medicine, but because it was not symptomatic, it was difficult to cure. He became weaker and weaker, and his suffering increased frequently. Last spring, he came to me for treatment. After I prescribed medicine symptomatically, I instructed him to buy and take "Spermogen" from Wing On Company. After taking it, his gonads immediately recovered their strength, and his kidney atrophy suddenly improved. The couple's feelings returned and were better than their initial marriage. Recently, I received a letter from him expressing his gratitude, saying that his wife was already full-term pregnant. Although the sex of the baby is unknown, he will never forget the merit of the famous medicine in reviving his weakness and restoring his vitality.</p>
<h3>(Published as Received) Irregular Menstruation Cured in a Month</h3>
<p>(Letter from Mr. Qi Shengyi) My wife and sister-in-law both suffered from irregular menstruation. They took many kinds of medicine, but the efficacy was difficult to say. Not only was the menstrual flow sometimes too much or too little, or painful or cold, but the menstrual period started early or late, and there was never any accuracy. Later, my sister-in-law learned from your publication that "Female Spermogen" has a definite effect in regulating menstruation. She first bought and took it from Wuzhou Pharmacy and was cured. Then she told my wife about the situation. So I also bought it for her to take. After a month, her menstruation was indeed regulated and her body was healthy. I am not eloquent and cannot fully describe my gratitude. My wife is now pregnant and her body is strong, as if she has been reborn.</p>
<h3>(Doctor's Report) Treatment for Nocturnal Emission and Premature Ejaculation</h3>
<p>(Report by Dr. Qiao Wenbin) Patient Lin Zengnian's gonads were destroyed by masturbation, resulting in nocturnal emission. After marriage, he also felt that he suffered from severe premature ejaculation. He repeatedly took tonics, but they were ineffective. He had headaches and back pain, body tremors and heart palpitations, presenting severe symptoms of weakness. Last autumn, he came to me for treatment. After I told him that nocturnal emission and premature ejaculation are both venereal diseases, but they cannot be treated with ordinary tonics, I immediately instructed him to buy "Spermogen" and "Schimitt's Spermin Tablets" from Jicheng Pharmacy and take them together. After taking them, he felt strong in his waist and back, and his middle Qi was surging. Both symptoms were treated together, and all the problems disappeared. He said that the two medicines were his saviors for rebirth.</p>
<h3>Safe Smoking Cessation Depends on Conditioning</h3>
<p>— Yu Bofu</p>
<p>Opium contains toxic substances. Temporary smoking can invigorate the spirit for a while and mask pain. If you smoke it continuously, the nerves will become paralyzed, and you must take a large amount to cheer up. Therefore, addiction is due to poisoning, and the heavier the addiction, the deeper the poison.</p>
<p>Recently, the last days of smoking have arrived. Unless you quit as soon as possible, the death penalty will be imposed. However, smokers are accustomed to it, and once they stop, their spirits will be sluggish, and pain will emerge, causing unspeakable suffering. The safety issue of smoking cessation has become an urgent priority in the call for smoking cessation.</p>
<p>The principle of smoking cessation lies first in removing the poison and second in breaking the addiction. However, if you do not treat the pain and replenish the spirit, it will be difficult to achieve complete success. This is why people give up halfway and fail to achieve success for the last basket.</p>
<p>If you take gonadal preparations during smoking cessation, the pain will be relieved, the spirit will be refreshed, the smoke poison will be removed, and the smoke addiction will be broken. This is what those who want to extricate themselves from the black list must know.</p>
<p>Men can take "Spermogen" for smoking cessation conditioning. Women can take "Female Spermogen" for smoking cessation conditioning. Although the effects are the same, the physiology is different. General ordinary smoking cessation conditioners do not distinguish between men and women and use one medicine for both, which is not perfect. Those who want to achieve complete success in smoking cessation should pay attention to this.</p>

<p>(1) Treating Premature Ejaculation and Stomach Pain with Separate Medications</p>
<p>Patient: Hu Guanqiu. Age: 34. Native of Fenghua. Businessman. (Chief Complaint) - Premature ejaculation, stomach pain, thin and weak body. (Medical History) - Mr. Hu has a very handsome appearance. Although his complexion is thin, it does not hide his handsomeness. He had many extramarital affairs in the past, with frequent socializing, which damaged his sexual function, leading to premature ejaculation. In addition, he was careless with his diet, often suffering from stomach pain. His digestive ability was weak, and his appetite declined. Due to a lack of nutrient intake, his body gradually became thin and weak. He had taken various medications before, but they were not effective because they did not address the root cause. (Treatment) - Last autumn, Mr. Hu was introduced by Mr. Xiaoyun to my clinic for treatment. I observed that Mr. Hu's reproductive glands were severely damaged, and ordinary endocrine preparations would not be effective. In addition to electrotherapy, I instructed him to purchase and take "Reproductive Element" from a Chinese-Western pharmacy to treat his premature ejaculation, and "Stomach Pain Relief" to treat his stomach pain, and "Digestive Aid" to stimulate his appetite and aid digestion. Within a month, his body became strong and regained his heroic appearance.</p>
<p>(2) Safely Quitting Smoking and Radically Curing Spermatorrhea</p>
<p>Patient: Ma Jingfu. Age: 42. Local resident. Businessman. (Chief Complaint) - Spermatorrhea, lower back pain, quitting smoking mid-way. (Medical History) - Mr. Ma damaged his body with alcohol and sex in his youth, leading to a multitude of illnesses. He saw countless doctors and took countless medications, but his spirit remained weary, causing him great suffering. He started smoking more than ten years ago and became addicted. Eventually, his illnesses persisted, and smoking became inconvenient. He repeatedly tried to quit but stopped due to mental anguish. He now suffers from severe spermatorrhea. (Treatment) - Last autumn, he came to my clinic for treatment. I prescribed "Hemi-tal Solidifying Essence Tablets" to strengthen his sperm retention, and his spermatorrhea was cured. I used "Reproductive Element" to revitalize his weakness, replenish his deficiencies, eliminate his nicotine addiction, and restore his vitality. After Mr. Ma took the medication from the Huamei Pharmacy, his spirit suddenly improved, his lower back became stronger, he safely quit smoking, and he successfully completed the treatment. He thanked me happily and left.</p>

<p>Patient: Mrs. Xia. Age: 31. Native of Suzhou. (Chief Complaint) - Lower back pain, irregular menstruation, cold uterus and abdominal pain, premature aging. (Medical History) - Mrs. Xia was inherently weak and prone to worry and illness. During her unmarried years, she suffered from irregular menstruation, abdominal pain, and lower back pain. After marriage, she became even more exhausted due to household chores.

Last spring, Mrs. Gu Jianping introduced her to my clinic for treatment. (Present Symptoms) - Leukorrhea, infertility. (Treatment) - I mainly used internal and external treatments. I instructed her to purchase "Female Reproductive Element" from Wing On Company to regulate menstruation, warm the uterus, promote pregnancy, and reverse aging.

Not only was his body weak and frail, but he was also frequently ill, unable to fulfill his marital duties, and had no hope of having children. He took various medications, but they were not effective because they did not address the root cause. Until last autumn, Mr. Fan Dece introduced him to my clinic for treatment. (Present Symptoms) - Neurasthenia, insomnia, anemia. (Treatment) - I diagnosed that Mr. Gao's illness originated from the decline of his reproductive glands, which could not be treated with ordinary medications.

He continued to take several boxes with peace of mind.

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Tragic Incident at Tianjin Warm Shelter</h3>
<p>— Xin Xin</p>
<p>According to recent reports from Tianjin, the tragic fire at the warm shelter is truly unbearable to read. What we see are only news reports and photos, and we already feel this way. If we had witnessed the tragedy firsthand or visited the site afterward, the impressions of sadness and horror would be ten or a hundred times greater.</p>
<p>The interior of the warm shelter was constructed entirely of flammable materials, which was already extremely dangerous. This "flammable" warm shelter was "locked with straw mats at night" and "had no management personnel." It was foreseeable that a fire would cause such an unprecedented tragedy.</p>
<p>Charitable endeavors can only passively prevent the poor from resorting to desperate measures, as clearly demonstrated in this incident. Moreover, if there are "charity hustlers" who "build their fortunes on charity," what is the value of charitable endeavors in society? It is self-evident that we need not say more.</p>
<p>Charitable endeavors only alleviate the emotions of the poor, as clearly demonstrated in this incident (as evidenced by the fact that "the poor regarded it as a blessed place and competed to live in the shelter! Even in the severe cold, they were very comfortable, and even rickshaw pullers and vendors abandoned their professions to live there"). However, what are the consequences of these passive effects? They cultivate the laziness of the poor. If you don't believe it, there is evidence: "After the Mingde warm shelters and the Huashang Gonghui's porridge distribution centers for men and women were completely burned down this morning, the poor men and women who relied on the porridge were unable to eat because the porridge centers were burned down. At the same time, they had no place to stay at night because the warm shelters were burned down. The poor were greatly disappointed."</p>
<p>It is a fact that without the establishment of porridge distribution centers, some of the poor would starve or freeze to death in the "severe cold." However, it is also inevitable that they would find a way to survive in order to fight against death. What is the difference between acquiring this survival skill and the current situation of "being unable to eat" and "having no place to stay" after the fire? Anyone with clear eyes can see this, and we need not belabor the point. Even if we step back and say that it provides a "very comfortable" "blessed place" for the poor in the "severe cold" to show a slight intention of "sharing happiness with the people," then these two warm shelters are simply too few. There are many people under the heavens (even in a small place like Tianjin) who want to enjoy a "very comfortable" "blessed place"!</p>
<p>Perhaps some would say that charitable endeavors are a desperate measure under the current social system, and that this measure is still most beneficial to the poor before the entire social system is thoroughly reformed. However, I still cannot remain silent because after the "major disaster," some people "held a mass for over a hundred victims and asked monks and Taoists to chant sutras to deliver their souls" at the First Branch Bureau. This kind of foolish and absurd thing is by no means the most beneficial to the poor.</p>
<p>What else can we talk about!</p>
<h3>Old Residence</h3>
<p>— Luo Zhihua</p>
<p>Lin Zibin was a fellow filled with fantasy and memories, his life seemed only to be for past enchantments.</p>
<p>I knew him from four years ago, after the September 18th Incident, in an apartment in Beiping. At that time, Beiping was like a crab being scalded by boiling water, with turmoil every day, and fear dominating the world. The ancient air of the past was awakened by the cold current that swept in from outside Shanhaiguan. Not only did the air clear people's minds, but the painful faces of the people fleeing from outside the關, also made people understand what kind of drama was about to be staged.</p>
<p>At that time, I was studying in Beiping, and after class, I often went to play at my fellow villager's place. One time, I ran into Lin Zibin.</p>
<p>His slender body had a small head on top, which didn't look very pleasing. Everything else was fine, his hair was black and shiny, and his eyes were bright and quick. His lips were as bright as if they had been painted with lipstick. He spoke in a low, delicate, feminine tone.</p>
<p>The first time I met him, I was a little unhappy: he had no backbone. So I didn't talk much. Later, my fellow villager told me: this guy had just run back from the Northeast and was preparing to study liberal arts at our school. The second time I saw him, I lowered my voice like an elementary school teacher trying to coax the truth out of a student, and said:</p>
<p>"Are you planning to enter the school, Mr. Lin?"</p>
<p>He turned around in surprise from "fantasy and memories," parted his bright lips, smiled, and said, "I am preparing to enter the liberal arts department of your school."</p>
<p>"Oh," I replied, staring at his movements with both eyes. He seemed afraid of me, his face was a little red, and his hands and feet couldn't find a suitable place to put them. When I noticed this, I quickly shifted my gaze to my fellow villager who was sketching, and said at the same time, "That's great, we have another companion!" He only smiled shyly.</p>
<p>Later, because the school organized a petition group to go south to Nanjing, we all participated, and we had more opportunities to talk, so we became familiar with each other.</p>
<p>In the petition group, because he was from the Northeast, he was particularly enthusiastic and crazy. He was excited every day, his little red face shouting:</p>
<p>"As long as the government sends troops to recover the lost territory according to what I think, I am willing to go back and be a soldier! ... You don't know how vast the grasslands of the Northeast are..."</p>
<p>Whenever he had free time, he would tell us about the situation in the Northeast. To supplement his inadequate descriptions, he would also show us five or six neatly arranged photo albums. Most of them were landscape photos and photos of his family. In these photos, he loved a small Western-style house standing in a garden the most. Every time he saw that picture, he would repeat it again and again without any sense of vulgarity:</p>
<p>"This is where I live." He pointed to the picture, as if he was immersed in memories again: "The scenery around here is really good. Looking out, it's a vast plain. In winter, it's all white snow, and in summer, it's all green grass. This house of mine is right here. It was built by my father when he was a brigade commander. He specifically told me to live in it. ... Alas, you don't know, the roof of this house is red tiles, and how well it matches the surrounding scenery! ... Like a bright red flower, standing in the green leaves... I have eight hundred Japanese literary books, all placed in this room, and my unfinished masterpiece "I am Hesitating in the Vast Northern Wilderness" is also placed in this room... But it's all gone during the September 18th Incident..."</p>
<p>He held the photo album, immersed in memories and fantasies.</p>
<p>Not only was he like this, but several young masters who came with him were also like this. At that time, their articles often appeared in the supplements of Beiping newspapers. The content of the articles was about missing their desolate Manchurian plains. Whether it was prose or poetry, the content of Lin Zibin's "I am Hesitating in the Vast Northern Wilderness" was also like this.</p>
<p>So later, when we saw Lin Zibin, we would say, "Have you written any memories recently?"</p>
<p>"No," another person said, "He's all in fantasy, he's fantasizing about his home being a hundred times more beautiful than before!"</p>
<p>He smiled shyly and said, "No, no, no, I'm just too, too, ... too sad! Too melancholic!"</p>
<p>In Nanjing, he was also very sad. When he saw a red house, he would say, "Alas, it looks so much like my house! ... When will I be able to see it again! ... That beautiful house, that desolate Manchuria, the lover's Manchuria!" He whistled softly and sighed!</p>
<p>But he had no choice but to live in an apartment in Beiping. He sent letters to his family, but his family didn't reply. He only had an elderly father. At the same time, life became more and more difficult. The more bitter life was, the sweeter the beautiful dreams of the past felt.</p>
<p>Four years passed quickly, and his life was completely built on writing a few articles. It was said that he had simply become dear friends with poverty in a month.</p>
<p>Last winter, I went to Beiping in a hurry to see my brother at school, and at the same time, I met with classmates I hadn't seen for a long time. I also saw him. His lips were already pale, his face was no longer rosy, and he was even thinner. Compared with his body, which seemed stubbornly long, it was even more disproportionate. His hands seemed to have only a few bones left. I shook his hand tightly and said:</p>
<p>"How's life?"</p>
<p>"Me," he was still as if immersed in memories: "It's still the same old story! ..."</p>
<p>I asked a friend, and the friend told me that his father had been killed by the ×× people because he was unwilling to be a traitor. Lin Zibin, then, became even more melancholy, and even less able to pull his feet out of the mire of fantasy and memories. Now he only hopes that one day a war will break out. He said, "I will definitely go to the front line!"</p>
<h3>Nonsense</h3>
<p>— (Fool)</p>
<p>The newspaper reported the other day that the negotiations in eastern Hebei have made "progress," and Yin will go to Peiping to take office, and the puppet organization will be abolished without any problems. Old Man Tan said, what is the so-called "progress," is it progress on the Japanese side? Or progress on our side? Although the puppet organization can be abolished, I am a little afraid of this famous Mr. Yin coming to Beiping.</p>
<p>The newly appointed Ambassador to China, Arida, brought a new policy towards China, with two points: 1. Based on the Three Principles, gradually concretize them; 2. Unify diplomacy, and coordinate foreign affairs with the military. We have already learned the Three Principles of Foreign Minister Hirota, and now we need to see how they are concretized and how foreign affairs are coordinated with the military! We Chinese should open our eyes and see.</p>

<h3>Early Winter in Qingyang Port (II)</h3>
<p>— Qiu Yuan</p>
<p>——Oh, I thought you were coming, so after I went to the school to see you, I immediately turned around and went back to the office,... Of course...</p>
<p>She revealed her white teeth, raised her right hand to her millet-yellow curly hair, and smiled slightly, containing an indescribable expression:</p>
<p>——I just arrived, finished writing these words, and was about to leave.</p>
<p>——That's how things are in the world, who knows.</p>
<p>——It's not good to put so many photos here, and I'm too embarrassed to take them all away. I'll leave one for you, you choose which one you want. Qiu Hua's eyes were fixed on Zhuo Min.</p>
<p>——Any one will do, the photos are yours, whichever one you give me, of course you think is the best one.</p>

<h3>Temptation Wireless Radio Script by the Drama Broadcasters Association (XV)</h3>
<p>— Written by Liu Yawei</p>
<p>What! Please let Zhigong go! A Qiao will wait honestly! Another person: Flatbread is here, flatbread is here!</p>
<p>Another member: What are you arguing with them about?</p>
<p>Relief worker: I'm really unlucky! This little girl says we're full and don't know they're hungry!</p>
<p>Another member: Then you talk too much, little girl; if we didn't know you were hungry, would we come to help you? (Fake smile)</p>
<p>Xiao Lu: That's right, that's right! You're right. How many flatbreads can one person get?</p>
<p>Another member: Lao Li, you take this bag and start distributing from that side, I'll start from this side. Two for each person, no stealing! (The flatbreads are then distributed, and the voices are naturally noisy again!)</p>
<p>Lao Wu: Heavens! I've never eaten such moldy flatbread since I came out of my mother's womb!</p>
<p>Aunt Wang: Keep your voice down! It'll cause trouble again!</p>
<p>A Qiao: What are you afraid of? We're just people who escaped from death!</p>
<p>Xiao Lu: Sir, sir! This flatbread is really... Not very tasty!</p>
<p>(As soon as Xiao Lu said these words, it seemed like a hundred responses, especially from Lao Wu, A Qiao, and Lao Xiang's group, whose shouts were particularly loud!)</p>

<p>City Sound (1340) 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM</p>
<p>Opening "Opening of Faded Red"</p>
<p>Where does the official boat moor in the river? . A mad autumn wind is chilling. A virtuous Sima of Jiangzhou sits above. In the seat, the wine spirit is very high. At that time. Distinguished guests and virtuous hosts were all seated. Not even knowing. Poems and songs were offered for jokes. At this moment. There was a woman of elegance on the neighboring boat. Only heard. The sad pipa played a song. Did not know. That old lady Qiuniang was still beautiful and enchanting. Also. Her voice was gentle, veiled. It was said that her name was Hua Tui Hong, showing infinite shame in front of guests. With head lowered, she had no words to speak. And tried to ask the past. She said. That when she was small, she was leaning on the door and selling charm. Staying close to dance fans and singing gowns. Soon. There were few carriages and horses in front of the door. Looking back, there was no home to return to. So she married a merchant's wife. But her husband went to Fuliang and had not returned yet. This lead to. Her loneliness as a swan dancing alone with its shadow. She could only use old artistic skills to earn a living. She did it. Only to make a meager living as family expenses were difficult. It was not that the red-face was thin-fated. But instead, she pitied her own status to the loss of her hairpin. Unexpectedly. It drew tears from the Jiangzhou Sima. And dampened the green shirt. Originally. Affectionate people were very talented. With a broken heart, he sighed three times. Not fearing the reward of his own waist. And hurried home at the end of night. With lamp lit, unable to sleep, she felt bored. She wrote a Pipa and her tears had not dried. And through the windows the setting sun was a curved hook.</p>

<p>Opening "Beautiful Woman Kite"</p>
<p>The spring light in February is new. A ethereal sound came down in the wind. Looking up at the outside of the sky in the clouds. With a heavenly ladder, it is enough to climb. I saw him. A glorious great future and was happy with his aspiration. Rising straight to drive the green cloud. All only for. The east wind intended to offer some lift. And showed all the limelight and wasn't ordinary. A silk dress left behind the swallows. Several sounds of refined music and the swallows were in harmony. He did not know. Where the sheng of Nongyu was blowing. This song was not in heaven. They all said. That the beauty song was good at adjusting the zither. Look at him. Fluttering like a shadow of the egret. As light as a swallow dancing in the air. Just like. Cai Yan of Wenji's Eighteen Beats. Just like. Tingling beat the Se and rung around. Just like. A Pipa, Zhao Jun grieved. Just like. Hong Xian who was talented and stole the box with ease. Take a look at him. The sleeves of the plain silk were cut and the clothing was thin. And light and spotless. The jade arm changed with the wind dancing. And pleased to learn a modern physical lightness. All for. A shameless clever child's frivolous ways. He feared she thought of a person who jumped out of building. He only feared. The tender jade branches and were charming without strength. So. A thread of red silk struck the feet. Sometimes. The wind would turn, the shadows fluttered in the air. And played for Yang Guifei who had gotten out of the bath was really the mountain's face. Where does one find confidants at the end of sky. If that was. One day, falling in the wind. Stirred up. A lot of cold eyes of onlookers. Therefore. The footing must not be missed. And when the gathering of peng arrives, please let him stay and stop. And tear where the paper is old. And you must prevent. The rain and wind is approaching朝夕. And originally. Life in the world is the same as a dream. And adrift with the wind and is equivalent to floating clouds. They were just the same who had rose and fell.</p>

<p>Opening "King of Chu"</p>
<p>Han Xin helped Liu to make great achievements. General Xiang lost the battle and showed his power. Lifting the mountain was all in vain. And half a lifetime of glory was all empty. The pitiable chase to the Wujiang River. And the wave were rolling and the road could not pass. There wasn't a foot of land in front. The pursuers were too fierce from behind. And Yuji died and Yuli advanced. Teaching the lonely king. What kind of face was able to return to Jiangdong. The soldiers under the tent. Reported the matter with sincerity. Oh Great King look. A small leaf in the river. If you can cross Wujiang. Go to Jiangdong to see the old man. At this time Xiang Yu had no choice. He hurried to say what an craftsman of boat. That one was. The small boat can only carry people but not horses. This trip made Chu heavy. Xiang Yu you. Where are the eight thousand elite soldiers. Don't tell me. As before you were brave and full of vigor. Oh great King. The elders of Jiangdong fang were starting to turn around. And you could revive all accomplishments. Xiang Yu was. Scolding the wind and clouds were changing and the sky's color. Rushing with a crown of anger that was really in his chest. The hegemonic career of a few years like a spring dream. The rush of air that's on the clouds was given to the east wind. The lonely one will not go to Jiangdong. You. Just take my head to offer it. Suddenly the gold drums were heard all over the ground. Xiang Yu turned his head with more anger. You see the chase of Yandun troops arrive. And the tigers chased the horses like dragons. Seen only. Xiang Yu only thought of Yuji as the first one. And only called the delicate face. Beauty ha. In the past I hoped to became king. Standing with you Zhaoyang to make right house. At that's why now it becomes a dream. That got. Really heart and soul withdrew from you at river's middle. Han Xin eh Han Xin you. The sub generals divided the troops into the ten-sided ambush. Killed the army to the dead and the blood-stained it red. Zhang Liang eh Zhang Liang. You scatter eight thousand soldiers. What a shame what you did. Is there no longer the face to turn back to Jiangdong. This point Xiang thought of only dying. But he pulled the sword off of his waist out of its sheath. Wujiang took his own life and the blood flowed red.</p>

<h3>Gu Lan Jun and Wang Zhengxin Officially Married</h3>
<p>— Ye Ke</p>
<p>Gu Lan Jun, one of the leading ladies in the "Peach and Plum Vie for Glory," indeed formally married Wang Zhengxin, the stalwart young actor, the day before yesterday. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Secret Before the Wedding   The love between Gu Lan Jun and Wang Zhengxin has been rumored for a long time. However, director Li Pingqian denied it. Therefore, it was not confirmed until after the wedding the day before yesterday afternoon. Director Li Pingqian remained tight-lipped two hours before Gu and Wang's wedding. This is how secret a female star's wedding can be.</p>
<p>Preparation Before the Wedding   At noon the day before yesterday, the staff of the Star Film Company's No. 2 studio were very busy. The Star Film Company's No. 1 car went to a shop on Jing'an Temple Road to purchase a large bouquet of fresh flowers, worth ten silver dollars, for the bride Gu Lan Jun. There was also a large pile of small fresh flowers and a large package of paper flowers for the guests. The bride went to a large fashion company in the morning to try on her wedding dress. The groom, Wang Zhengxin, also had a shave and bath. The administrative staff also actively prepared for the wedding ceremony that day.</p>
<p>Guests Gathered   The clock struck twelve. Two large trucks carrying male and female guests, totaling more than one hundred, arrived in front of the Star Film Company's No. 2 studio. They were dressed in colorful attire and were very happy. Then, the general affairs department arranged for a Chinese lunch, catered by the Star Film Company's kitchen, with twenty tables. The guests devoured the food, and soon the dishes were empty. After the meal, a bell rang in the photography studio, and everyone rushed to the photography studio.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Wedding Hall   To avoid outside attention, the wedding hall was set up in the Star Film Company's No. 2 photography studio. The hall was designed by the famous set designer Jing Liting, so all the decorations were very magnificent. Around the hall hung scrolls presented by relatives, friends, and local dignitaries, as well as various silver tripods and silver cups, in a dazzling array of colors, making it a grand occasion.</p>
<p>Wedding Ceremony   The bell rang three times, and the music started. The wedding of this pair of male and female movie stars began. The bride and groom walked in slowly with smiles. Behind the groom were four groomsmen: You Guangzhao, Wang Jiting, Li Qing, and Sun Min. These four were all acquaintances of the newlyweds. The master of ceremonies was the director with a small mustache, Li Pingqian. The person in charge of maintaining order was the stage manager Bi Hu. When the newlyweds reached the guests, the hundred or so male and female guests threw long strips of colored paper at them. For a time, the hall was filled with the sound of throwing colored paper and cheers. The photographer Wang Shizhen was there to capture the memory of this wedding.</p>
<p>Honeymoon After the Wedding   It is said that after their wedding, Gu Lan Jun and Wang Zhengxin will spend their honeymoon in Shanghai, and then explain the wedding process to all the citizens of Shanghai. As for when they will make a public appearance, according to Li Pingqian, it will be around the time of the "Peach and Plum Vie for Glory."</p>

<h3>Silver Jottings</h3>
<p>— Zhi Er</p>
<p>The National Salvation Association of the Film Industry made a brief appearance at the Atlantic seat, and "Dai Jie, who had to change the road because of his currency, added the hat of ×× home. Those ""Seven Geli Pens""—imitating ""Chocolate Sticks""—should be able to ""save their lives.""</p>
<p>"Malay Pirates" is also known as "Chinese Sea." Newsreels from the Film Censorship Committee also aired prior to the screening.</p>
<p>One Saturday, movie emperor Jin Yan and his beloved cat Wang Renmei played mahjong at Mr. Ding's house until 5:00 a.m. According to frontline scouts, Jin's tactics were quite outstanding.</p>
<p>"Song of Everlasting Regret" made a few more days' worth of business because of the lawsuit involving Little Lin Daiyu. However, "Flower Candle Night," which had "enthusiastic requests from all walks of life to be re-screened soon," was replaced by "Moroccan Adventurer" because of Xia Yabin's arrival in Shanghai, but for audiences who haven't seen this movie, this is a rare opportunity.</p>
<p>Zhang Shichuan is still "raging" after Zhengqiu's death, just like in the past.</p>
<p>In the first item of yesterday's miscellany, "being in" the house should be "looking for" a house, and in the fourth item, "the methods" of the "movie industry veteran" were mistakenly reported as "reporting methods." This is a correction.</p>
