<h3>論西班牙之亂</h3>
<p>— 恒</p>
<p>近數日來西班牙因軍人之謀叛時局機形　重今後趨勢如何大可注意該國自一九三一年四月以公民投票方式推翻軍政建立共和政體以來政局動盪迄未寧定、初則中左各派佔優勢草擬　法分離政教推行改革土地普及教育之計劃一時似頗有作為然右派勢力、實際上仍極活躍、故大地主之土地被分割者無幾天主教會之教產大部份亦依然存在至一九三三年十二月總選時右派遽告勝利而一九三一年革命以還之種種改革計劃遂皆擱置不行卽人民之意法權利、亦長期停止、因此引起民眾之不滿暴動也工潮也幾於無日無之至今年二月總選左翼各黨以締有人民陣線之故又告大勝利於是右翼各黨於國會中陷於無能為力之境地至是而策動反動軍人之復辟陰謀造成慘烈之戰禍、固意中事也</p>
<p>西班牙現政府對於此次軍人之叛變有無敉平之能力、尚難臆測然可得而言者西班牙今次事變實為西班牙左右兩派實力之試金石、而其政治形態因此亦將發生變化、吾人固知現國會中左翼各黨頗佔優勢、然就政權而言舉足重輕而當其衡者、實為中左派之左翼共和黨此黨實質上為一中產階級之政黨因欲聯絡極左之社會黨共產黨與無政府工團主義派以保持自己之優勢、不能不於政策上表現左傾之色彩如大赦一九三四年十月暴動中被捕之各政治犯、於大地產尚未執行分配前佃農暫不繳租等等措置、皆所以迎合極左派之要求者、但左翼共和黨旣為一中產階級之政黨自有中產階級獨特之立場故極左派於人民陣綫綱領中雖開列士地銀行國有與事業津貼等項目、至今仍未見實施、設極左派逼之過甚、彼或竟與右派携手亦屬可能而在極左派之心目中固亦以左翼共和黨政府為一過渡之統治也</p>

<h3>廣田內閣到何處去（五）</h3>
<p>— 家禾</p>
<p>如果把久原的失脚，和軍部的暫收鋒芒，作為急進法西斯的一時退潮，那未，好似政黨的勢力，眞正德謨克列西的勢力，要比例地長大了。事實並非如此。今日日本的政黨，由於本身的腐敗，和素來與財閥勾結而生疑獄的醜史，要恢復自己的名譽，已屬難能。軍部的旣成勢力，决非不孚人望的政黨領袖，所能操縱。而且在政黨之上的元老重臣，也沒有信任政黨的勇氣。就是財閥們，自「二·二六」政變後，一方面施欺騙的手段，期消除大衆的怨恨心，另一面也放棄歷來利用政黨的政策，直接和軍部的領袖發生關係。他們各以金錢的勢力，拉攏可為自己爭利益的武力，希望後日收回重大的代價。因此，失去財閥極力贊助的政黨，口裏說更生，事實上他的心臟却一天一天地衰弱下去。雖然，在議會中，政黨還成為一個通過議案的工具，但這是死光的返照。目前，他們和風前之燭一樣，只要在風一起，連豆粒似的光芒也都會消失；而况，在他們之外，另有時時剝奪他們利益之官僚的勢力。廣田處在這樣環境中，裝成了八面玲瓏的美人，為着「憲政政治」的金字招牌，他拉攏政黨，以增厚自己對抗軍部的力量；為着掣肘政黨，他有時也假軍部的威權。他乘風轉舵，沒有固定的成見。他所以如此，是具着客觀的原因！已走上寡頭財閥統制各產業部鬥之階段的日本資本主義，眞正為民主制度而鬥爭的政黨，早已奄奄一息。目前的政黨，不管民政黨，政友會，昭和會或國民同盟，彼此之間雖有政綱上的美異，而都是戴上憲政的面目，無慈悲地壓迫那無產階級。為着無產階級的勢力，還不足使統治階級手忙脚亂，所以，他們也利用政黨之名不副實的議會政治，作為彼此瓜分利益的機關，作為限制狂瘋地擴軍的調節器，作為制定各種法規合法地束縛工農的工具。若使有一天，日木的統治階級證明，這個機關，這個調節器，這個工具，已失去牠的功能，他便抓住野中四郎們的幽靈，換句話說：他採取了急進法西斯的路綫。</p>
<p>廣田內閣，又好似是一架天秤，把政黨，軍部和官僚的勢力，放在牠的上面，用特製的砝碼去量度。當特別會議間幕時，他動員政黨，訓戒軍部，同時他也討好軍部，抬高他們的權力，那就是五月十八日的現役大中將任軍部大臣，和現役中少將任决官的法令。有些人根據該官制之歷史的發展，認為牠是政黨和軍都勢力消長的指針，固有充分的理由。但如由此以為廣田內閣已失去過渡型，是對軍部屈服的表現，那未免流於武斷。我們知道軍部制度的改革，始於大正二年。那時候自由主義盛行，山木內閣鑒於西國寺內閣被上原陸相「毒殺」的前事，不顧長谷川好道大將的反對，和陸相木越的辭職，把軍部大臣的資格擴大至預備役。可是，自官制公佈之日起，到廣田內閣成立止，却沒有預備役大中將就任軍部大臣的事實，反使陸軍內部弄成了三頭政治——卽長官决定人事的惡例。現在廣出一反山本內閣所為，也有他的理由：第一，事實木是如此；其决，如其任三長官决定人事，不如讓軍部大臣操握事權；第三，荒木，眞崎們已編入預備役，此後無法再操軍權。由是觀之，廣田的行為，决不是沒有他的意義。而且僅僅一個軍部現役武官制的法令，也不足證明廣田內閣，已失去了過渡期的性質。</p>

<h3>中學敎育（中）</h3>
<p>— 上海光華大學教授廖世界</p>
<p>中學敎育的宗旨一國的敎育宗旨，視時代為轉移。前淸所定的敎育宗旨為忠君，尊孔，尙公，尙實，尙武諸端。至光緒末年宣統初年，漸傾向實利主義，採取文實分科的辦法。民元時，「以美感完成其道德」為敎育目標，民六則又注重職業敎育。民八以後，各中學採用選科辦法，力謀適應僩性。民十一所須行的新學制，定有六項原則（此原則曾經第一次全國敎育會議修正）：（一）根據本國實情，（二）適應民生需要，（三）增高敎育效率，（四）謀個性之發展，（五）使敎育易於普及，（六）留地方伸縮可能。自國民革命軍底定全國，成立國民政府以後，凡百設施，莫不氣象一新，於是有三民主義敎育的誕生，十八年四月國民政府又明令公布敎育宗旨：「中華民國之敎育，根據三民主義，以充實人民生活，扶植社會生存，發展國民生計，延續民族生命為目的，務期民族獨立，民權普遍，民生發展，以促進世界大同。」關於中學敎育目標，則具載於二十二年部頒之中學規程總綱中：（一）銀鍊强健體格，（二）陶冶公民道德，（三）培育民族文化，（四）充實生活知能，（五）培植科學基礎，（六）養成勞動習慣，（七）啟發藝衛興趣。自東四省事變以來，國難嚴重，數倍於往昔，於是國防敎育，生產敎育，非常時期敎育的呼聲，瀰漫全國。最近發表的中華民國憲法草案，規定敎育宗旨，在發揚民族精神，培養國民道德，訓練自治能力，增進生產知能，以造成健全國民。我們以後能把握住這四個要點，切實設施，定可收到明確的效果，達到救亡的目</p>
<p>中學的課程課程就是「民族經騐」的解釋，表示這許多事情，幼年必須經壓的意思。所以一時代的課程，就代表一時代的需要。我國中學的課程，已變更好幾决了。前淸光緒年問的中學課程，分為十二門：（一）修身，（二）讀經講經，（三）中國文學，（四）外國語，（五）歷史，（六）地理，（七）算學，（八）博物，（九）物理及化學，（十）法制及理財，（十）（一）圖畫，（十）（二）體操。每星期有三十六小時。宣統時，中學有文實分科辦法。民國初年，中學廢除讀經，增加藝術科，每週授課時間也减為三十四小時。八年敎部咨准中學得斟酌地方情形，酌量增减科目及時間，」各校就根據這條咨文，相率採用選科制。新制推行後，全國敎育聯合會曾擬訂一新學制課程標準綱要。十八年秋季敎部又頒布中小學課程暫行標準，學程頗有更動。二十一年十一月敎部復頒布高初中課程新標準，有下列幾種變動：（一）黨義敎材，分別編入公民歷史，地理等科目，不另設科：（二）取消選修科目及學分制；（三）取消高初中文理分科制；（四）增加授課鐘點。新標準頒布後，各地學校均感功踝繁重，無暇顧及課外活動。因此課程標準在本年二月又經敎部修正，其要點的有數項：</p>
<p>（一）注重養成學生自動研習能力，减輕其課程負擔近年來社會人士間有評論中學課程偏重書本知識，總時數太多，敎材分量過重，缺乏自動研習及興趣，甚至有礙其身心的發展。此次數部修正是項敎學科目及時類表，首先注意减輕學生課程上的負担，發展其自動研習的能力。初中以前每週敎學總時數為三十四五小時，現减為三十一小時；高中以前為三十一至三十四小時，現改為二十九小時左右。各該减少時數之科目，其敎材內容亦隨之酌减。</p>
<p>（二）注重民族意識　敎部於公布修正的初高中數學科目及時數表後，其第二步工作，卽為修訂充實初高中各科課程標準於公民，國文，史地等科，添增關於民族精神的敎村。</p>
<p>（三）顧及學生個性　舊有的高中敎學科目及時數表缺乏彈性，對於學生個性方面，未盡顧到。此次敎部於修正表中規定於高中第二學年起，學生得分甲乙兩組。性近自然科學的學生，得多習算學；性近文史與社會科學的，得少習算學，多習國文論理英語等科，以為替代。</p>
<p>（四）兼顧不升學學生　高中本為升學而設，但實際上仍有不少學生不能升學。在現行學制下，此項學生，本以入中等職業學校為正當途徑，惟事實上學生之選校，往往不盡合理，而職校的數量，亦尙不敷需要。故敎部於此次修正的高中敎學科目及時數表中，規定高中仍得視地方情形，於最後學年，酌設簡易職業科目　（如商業，會計，簿肥，統計，應用文書，打字，農藝，園藝，合作社等），以為選修科目，庶幾不能升學的人，仍得為就業的準備。此外敎部並正着手編訂各科編輯要目，以利敎學</p>
<p>中學的敎學　敎的目的，在使學生學。要學生學，必須鼓勵學生，引導學生，使學生處在學習的情境之下。通常的敎師和學生，對於學習的誤解頗多：</p>
<p>一，誤解學習的材料為學習的結果　最普遍的誤解為注重事實的記憶，敎材的複述，以及做規定的習題綱要等。這都不是眞實的學習。眞實的結果，大家都忘記了。各人都追逐於假的學習，結果造成一般讀死書的人，於處世接物方面，毫不發生效用、這種敎育，袛能稱為紙片的敎育，書獃子的敎育。</p>
<p>我們說這些話，並不少說觀念，事實，見聞不佔重要的地位、我們需要這些事實，需要記憶式的試騐。但我們總須認定記憶這些事實，並不是最後目的，乃為獲得學習結果的一種方法。倘使我們傾向在事實的保存，或牢記敎師的話，必致偏重記憶，忽略應用，承認做功課為眞的學習。反省的思想和順應的能力便得不到了。</p>
<p>二，誤解分數為學業成續的代表學生看見多記得事實，可以得到高分，他的心神，就轉到分數方面去。他紙要得到分數，任何方法都願採用——强記，鈔襲，作弊。結果墮落到更下一層，連做功課這一點都達不到。他非但沒有養成良好的行為，連不良好的態度都根深蒂固的造成了。並且定了及格分數以後，學生只求得過且過，不肯全心全意的研求學問。精神的訓練，簡直談不到。</p>
<p>但也有人說，在學校內成績優異的學生，在社會上成功的機會似乎大些、分數是否可代表成績？回答這個問題，須分別來說。如學生的目的，在追逐分數而不在獲得眞實的了解和能力，那麼他的分數未必能代表成績。如學生的目的不在分數，而因他有持久的注意，不懈的努力，敏慧的鑒別，搜討的能力，纔得到高分。那麼他的分數，可以代表他的造詣。</p>
<p>評定分數，也很困難。眞的學習，必須獲得新的反應，應用在眞實的情景方面。複述敎材，並不一定表示了解。要創造一種新的境界，纔能試騐了解和能力。說得透澈些，祇有生活上發生的實際問題，纔能試騐學習結果。</p>

<h3>鹽務署　改良鹽政</h3>
<p>準備實施新鹽法</p>
<p>申時社云、自去年新鹽法公佈以來、鹽務署首卽整頓各省鹽塲工作方針、依新鹽法之自由買賣、就塲征稅二原則進行、積極改良產銷平衡稅收、茲分誌該所推行新鹽法之整理計劃如下、</p>
<p>整頓事項</p>
<p>我國鹽政、數千年來墨守成法、迄今仍未健全、影響國家稅收及民食殊鉅、自去年新鹽法公佈以來、鹽務署遂决從事澈底改革鹽政、取消分岸、整理塲產、取締土硝鹽、齊一品質、改善鹽民生活、皆為今日鹽政上亟宜整頓之事項、</p>
<p>整理塲產</p>
<p>我國鹽塲、甚為散漫、管理不易、就塲微稅極為因難、勢必漏稅、故整理鹽塲、最重里要之任務、為裁併鹽塲與建設倉拕、其不可少之步驟有三、（一）調查塲產與測繪塲區、將鹽塲之面積倉坨數目、交通工具、生產成本、鹽產品質、鹽民生活等、作一詳細報告、然後根據是項報告、研究整頓辦法、（二）裁併塲地、設置鹽塲、因有不少鹽塲、產量少、成本高、滷水淡、地段過於零星、此種鹽塲、當裁而廢之、並安置被裁廢區失業鹽民之善後辦法、一面撫卹鹽民、化鹽為農、一面將鹽塲開濬塘渠、引水冲淡、改善土壤、改鹽為墾、（三）建設倉拕、修路開溝、使鹽塲管理改良、以免漏稅、</p>
<p>改良製造</p>
<p>我國製鹽、歷來墨守古法、鮮有改良、故鹽質甚劣、惟將來實行新鹽法、自由貿易、引岸打破以後、劣質之鹽、勢將難以競銷、故改良製造、實屬首要、（一）檢查鹽質、以促進製造之改進、（二）廢煎改晒、以减低製鹽之成本、（三）改良粗鹽製造之技術、以捉高組鹽之品質、（四）提倡精鹽、以求物質之進步、</p>
<p>取締劣鹽</p>
<p>我國鹽產、除海鹽·池鹽·井鹽·之外、尙有膏鹽·硝鹽·及土鹽三種、內以土·硝·二種食鹽、不特產地甚廣、且散漫已極、鹽質所含氣化鈉之成分、大都在百分之六十以下、用以作食鹽、旣礙衛生又侵國課、故常嚴禁、</p>
<p>整頓近况</p>
<p>該署除改良塲產等外、對於改善鹽民生活及平衡稅率、舉辦鹽民貸欵、救濟鹽民生計等、亦力求實施、聞長蘆兩淮鹽塲、對建築鹽坑改良品質等事項，均將告成，或可首先實行新鹽法、至浙江山東·福建·廣東·等鹽塲、現正在積極整頓期間·預料全國實行新鹽法、可就塲徽稅、自由買賣、為期當不在遠、</p>

<h3>中央敎育行政最近趨勢　高等敎育注重實科已見成效　改進中學實施義敎推廣民校</h3>
<p>（南京特訊）敎育部近三年來、對於各級敎育多所改革事實均散見於各報紙、惟部長王世杰氏、抱埋頭苦幹精神、甚少向各報記者表示敎育行政意見、部中高級職員、亦均秉此旨以行、對於行政事務、甚鮮作有系統之說明、記者値此二十四年度業已結束、二十五年度開始之際、特將最近中央敎育行政之趨勢、作一有系統之叙述、</p>
<p>高等敎育方面、近年來所持之政策、為縮小範圍與充實內容、不求數量的發展、只求質素的改進、力避舖張裝飾、專務實事求是、年來重複院系之裁併、學校內容之改進、均已漸著成效、限制文法科與注重實科、允具明顯之成績、據敎部發表之統計、實科畢業生已增加百分之三、文法科减少百分之三、實科新生上年度佔百分之四十五、本年度、一躍而增至百分之五十一、昔之文法科事生多於實科、今則實科超出於文法科、其收效之宏、可以槪見、私立專科以上學校之補助費額、亦大多數用於實科方面、私校受惠不淺/公自費之留學生、實科佔絕對大多數、最近除繼續原有政策外、並漸謀邊疆高等敎育之發展、如籌辦國立西北大學與補助廣西雲南兩大學、卽其明證、此外尙有一事、卽注意大學畢業生之出路問題是也、去年曾與全國經濟委員會合設學術工作諮詢處、本年復有大學畢業生就業訓導班之與辦、是高等敎育行政之趨勢、以性質言、已由數的擴充而漸趨於質的改進、以內容言、已由畸形的發展而漸趨於合理的充實、以地域言、已由都市及內地的發展而漸趨於邊疆的進展、以成效言已由人才的造就而漸趨於人才的任用、</p>
<p>普通敎育方面、年來重大改革為中學與師範分離、中學課程分組、積極擴充職業敎育與義務敎育是巳、中學與師範、在昔原為混合制度、高中設立師範科、嗣以中學師範混合設置、弊多利少、乃有分開設立之規定、目不能由私人辦理、以免發生流弊、近敎部在行政上亦專設一科、辦理師範敎育事宜、高中課程、原無分組之規定、但自課程標準實施以來、漸感覺分組之需要、各方輿論、亦多表示同意、於是乃有本年修正中學課程標準之舉、高中分設甲乙兩組、雖無文理科之名義、實際上與文理科並無差池、且為設職業科目、以備學生選習、職業敎育、敎部早已設立一科專司其事、其重視可見一班、各省市職業敎育經費、已漸達部定標準、本年且設有優良職業學校之補助費額、以資獎進、義務敎育在我國已高唱二十餘年、始終以經費關係、未充實現、迄去年經敎部最大之努力、國家預算中、乃開始列入此項經費、為敎育行政上最可紀念之一事、二十五年度預算、已由三百二十萬元增至四百七十萬元、敎部除設義務敎育委員會專司設計外、近且增設義務敎育科、管理義敎行政事宜、至邊疆義敎之推行、年來亦漸加重視、邊疆敎育經費本年亦有增加、最近在綏遠設立一國立師範學校、卽為推進蒙藏義敎之先聲、是普通敎育行政在中學方面、已趨於分組之趨勢、職業敎育已漸趨於普遍、義務教育已由都市鄉村漸决擴展於邊疆矣、</p>
<p>社會敎育方面、年來除擴充民衆學校及民衆敎育館外新的重要設施、為播音敎育之實施、播音敎育在我國尙屬創舉、成效如何、因實行未久、尙難作準確之估計、民衆敎育向無辦理標準、自敎部公布民衆學校規程以後、課程設施、乃有銑一之準則、最近敎部正努力於民衆讀物及民校敎本之編輯、預計不久卽可頒行、是社會教育行政之趨勢、巳由數量的進展而漸趨於實質的注重、並已由狹義的社會敎育而漸趨於廣義的社會敎育、</p>

<h3>證券　交割期近　公債再見新高價　甲種出七十元關口</h3>
<p>昨華商證券交易所、市況仍極良好、多方餘勇可賈、甲種居然衝出七十元大關、再見新高價、乙種亦因之發見新高價、公債市塲、因交割逼迫、空方懾於多方之威脅、似已屈服、論趨勢尙有續漲之可能、維回風亦不可不防耳、昨日經過、開盤十號十一號及四十七號等大批掉期、多空互有進退、但籌碼供求上、仍感缺乞、漲風再起、趨勢極為堅挺、為有統一公債以來未有之好現象、甲乙兩種再見新高價、甲種衝出七十元大關、亦為最新發見之記錄、市價一律好四五角至七八角、空方爭先抵補、次盤戊丁兩種空頭掉期、又漲一角至四角半、入後賣氣漸湧、四號十一號出籠、十六及五十九號賣出亦多、趨勢稍弱、後列一律稍稍疲落五分一角至三角半不等、趨勢已脫離常軌、本月尙餘二日、變動尙多也、市價結果、除本月乙種小五分外、餘則一致再漲四五角至九角不等、成交總數、共計一千一百三十萬元、茲將其漲跌結果、比較列表於左、（單位元成交單位百元）、</p>
<h3>紗花　新紗解進五千包　近期一度回跌　惟遠月跌勢稍止</h3>
<p>紗市晨跌午回、局勢轉趨平靜、實則連朝下落、比十一日高價時已跌去十餘元、或者有一度小回風亦未可知也、但本月份多空元方皆有相當的準備、且七·八兩月差價益巨、又可套利矣、</p>
<p>八月期已可套利</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、因海外紗花市況一律下跌、市塲人心不振、且多說本月份交貨籌碼充足、有新貨解進五千包之巨、於是近月趨勢甚挫、賣者益夥、浮多威脅斬結、遠期牽入漩渦、市盤愈拍愈鬆、結果各月比上日收盤價均跌一元二·四·六·八角、午後開盤、本月跌風仍　、敲破四元關口、惟遠期跌勢和緩、因一部份多方掉期、二盤近月平平、遠月忽跳八·九角至一元外、因本月與八月價可以套利、於此虛風轉定、且證幫及某方面又來拉提加碼、午盤跌勢遂止、結果各月比上日收盤價均漲四·五·七角至一元、查賣出大孚一千五百五十包、聚興九百包、益記八百五十包、永裕八百包、仁豐一千六百五十包、大昌成一千二百包、益昶一千二百包、長豐一千九百五十包、同和一千包、錦昌二千二百五十包、協成九百五十包、買進證記一千三百包、德大一千一百包、通記二千二百五十包、　豐一千五百五十包、豐泰一千包、慎記一千一百五十包、泰昌一千包、裕大一千一百包、潤康一千三百包、一日間最高低價列下、</p>
<p>紗銷清而售價堅</p>
<p>現紗銷路平平、查全日各幫買去統計八百四十包、售價堅定、各幫買額列下、</p>
<h3>近期存賬數尙大　陳花漲風重起　本下月又跳一元四至一元一</h3>
<p>棉市陳花轉趨上騰、七月期僅剩二天營業、存賬數尚有十五萬二千八百担、據云多頭方面仍安然不動、又有一說、棉花檢騐處審查之棉、已達六七萬担、其中有數萬担交解與否、尙難斷定耳、</p>
<p>標花陳漲新跌</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、美棉因華爾街賣出、多頭了結而跌十至十七磅音、印棉停市、大阪三品花跌六·七角、市塲人心依然不佳、人心望低、陳花跌四角至一角半、新花賣氣尤濃、狂跌三·四角、二三盤陳花徐徐上升、惟新花平常、收盤陳花轉堅、遠期勿動、結果陳花比上日收盤價漲一·三角、遠跌四角半至五角、午後開盤、七·八·月多方安然不動、猛跳八角至九角半、遠期跟漲一角半、二三盤仍昂、迨至收盤陳花再漲、新花亦穩定、結果七·八·月比上午收盤價均漲一元至一元一角、新花漲二角半至三角、查賣出昶記二千二百担、大豐二千一百担、源大一千二百担、大孚二千一百担、合興三千三百担、長餘一千四百担、慎記四千七百担、大昌成一千八百担、源興昌一千六百担、長和四千九百担、買進大孚三千六百担、聚興一千六百担、裕大二千六百担、森康二千三百担、同豐五千一百担、元一一千一百担、長豐一千四百担、潤康二千六百担、恒昌二千二百担、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>
<p>現棉廠需停頓</p>
<p>現棉消費仍屬清寂、廠需依然沉悶、來源姚花一千二百八十包、</p>
<h3>美英棉價反動回跌　印棉停市三品紗花亦小</h3>
<p>昨美棉開盤、各月漲跌一至五磅音、晨初利物浦消息雖跌、然因同業及本地幫買進、奧克拉霍馬缺雨、每週天氣報告預料欠利、市況堅定、旋以七月期有十五紙交割通知單、華爾街多頭了結、買戶套賣、紡織品需要阻止同業進胃、市況反動、收盤前略有補空、現需靜寂、腳地尙堅、計現貨跌十七磅音、期貨跌十至十七磅音、英棉現貨跌三點、期貨跌五六點、印棉停市、原雷錄左（二十二日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、二十三日開盤預測、七八月期白羅溪為二百三十羅比、跌五·二五羅比、四五月期白羅溪為二百十六羅比、跌五羅比、十二正月期奧姆辣為一百九十六羅比、跌三·七五羅比、</p>
<p>二十三日大阪電、三品期紗跌一元二角至二元一角、近月為二百十二元六角、遠月為二百零四元七角、期棉跌七角五分至一元一角五分、近月為六十九元四角五分、遠月為六十四元七角、</p>
<h3>頭　棉布不敷需求　日廠承接印南洋細布定貨　墊棧單須一二週後方能出得</h3>
<p>昨日棉布市面、因實銷繼續良好、東貨細布·細斜·現貨仍不敷需求、墊棧單後須一二週後方能出得現貨、市盤棧單派貨與現貨相距一角以外、滬埠上海·公大等日廠、因承接印·　·南洋十碼細布定貨源源裝去、否則將益感困難、故紗花雖見回軟、市勢仍極堅挺、八月份各廠細布、頗有開出、廠盤較市盤高五分之譜、喇叭童五幅集詳龍頭等牌、染廠進胃仍健、成交已達千餘件、惟洋紗落令後、下擋洋紗　布十磅市布、因需要衰退、售盤不振、逐漸疲落、距一週前高峯時、跌落每　四角之鉅、秋季繁銷之印花棉絨各廠陸續定出、總計已逾八千箱、以常州大成廠花樣最為新穎佳妙、售盤英雄雙兔二牌、頃定出每碼一角九分二五、亦較餘廠出品為昂、　　綫呢亦有鋸額定貨做出、該項　布除各家自織外、多數均向滬常各綫廠承　、故本色棉布之不敷市需、亦坐此原因也、昨客路走銷、四川及湘省仍為最佳、粵幫細布進胃仍健、其餘各路實需、均形發展云、</p>
<h3>外洋來貨頗稀　元芳呌價不免減色</h3>
<p>昨週四、逢元芳第二九九九次拍貨、陳列者祗泰西緞元羽綢元絨直貢呢四種、計二十七牌、共三十箱、近因外洋來貨太稀、向有漂布及白洋紗元府綢洋紅藍布、缺貨均未列入、市形呆鈍、呌價比上期減色、泰西緞回低二三分、元絨好一分、直貢呢升二分半、元羽綢十八牌皆見下遜、花爛牌降五角、其餘跌一二角、其中加入燕國公三元第二牌、久未列入、呌價亦平常云、</p>
<h3>糧食　籌碼感缺　本月粉仍到限價</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份又呈穩固之狀、以本月份不久又須交割、空方籌碼、又感缺乏、所以開價由到限價、而交易亦見停頓、至八月份以下、初以客戶頗有抵進、故形勢亦緊、如十一十二月份亦到限價、後以浮多吐出、又稍軟弱、迨至下午開盤、本月份仍到限價、未見鬆象、遠期初因業外套進、人心穩固、惟入後則均不暢、大致轉定、而一般人則以主要之食米、逐步見鬆、故以事實立言、當難過分騰　云、</p>
<h3>麥價已與糙米相　期限貨交易更清</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份大致平穩、因洋麥報價互有出入、至國內情形、產區報價雖未大鬆、但日來米值因新米再過一月、又須登塲、照目下糙米市價、已與麥價相仿、有此比擬、似乎小麥不能獨昂、故交易既少、價遂見平、迨至下午開盤、近期交易仍清、九十月份因多頭回出、微小一二分、十一·十二月份全日未開、現麥市面、高貨提起二分、中次廠家不辦、開明光管店沙河集麥四元五角七分、江西麥四元三角半、次二角、滁州麥四元五角半、次五角三分、淮安麥四元四角九分、次四角六分、黃橋麥四元五角、次四角八分、宿遷麥四元五角二分、次五角、漢口麥四元三角八分、由福新辦五千包、申大辦二千包云、</p>
<h3>新貨不日上市　客削價求銷</h3>
<p>昨日各路客　續有到申、而行囤客販仍主速脫、良以天氣炎熱、久擱難免發熱耗虧、且各地旱　不日上市、再一旬半月之後、市上即有早　見到、新貨一到、陳米更遭影響、故目下長江一帶產區、亦多跌價求銷、昨日在各幫求售之下、價又突落一角許至二角外、跌價後市面尙見活潑、本客幫均有應酬、但應酬數額不多、總計只有五千多包、終不易挽回頹勢、全日開出江西米三千三百五十三包、溫州米八十一包、湘米一千六百十包、</p>
<h3>河米到稀銷路亦淡　市價一再削小</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各幫來源雖祗到十餘號、奈本街銷路更清、包胃龍口幫亦僅辦薄稻百餘包、及南洋幫辦厚粳二百餘包、故勢形帶疲、市況下降、結果厚早粳及薄稻行情短小幾分至近角、杜洋尖亦貶五分、陰變元到銷兩稀、無甚榮辱、</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日河下各幫到船寥落、約僅十號、因此客方早市、中次白粳價喊昂近角、後因去化平常、結果市形定立、薄稻缺貨未開、羊　高貨勉立、中下者價又小一角左右、白元挺秀、杜埠客尖零拆滯細、價又小數分、其餘各貨、價形疲軟之勢、</p>
<h3>新黃豆有油廠起而問津</h3>
<p>昨日新黃豆市況續呈繼漲之局、各路新貨均見高、但高貨依然不湧、去路多一榨油廠問津、故市塲中氣象更覺活潑、城門豆做開七百餘包、價自五元七角至四角半、江橋豆三十包、價為五元七角、都昌豆一百五十餘包、價為五元八角、鄱陽豆六十餘包、價為五元八角二、三陽豆一百十包、價為五元八九角、柳芳池豆五十包、價為五元七角半、漢口六月白一百餘包、價為五元九角半、尚有內地辦去四平街豆一百包、及廠家採去崇明沙黃千餘包、行情穩定、</p>
<h3>絲茶　海外絲價升降甚微　洋莊挽手絲成交百四十五件</h3>
<p>昨日國外絲市、升降甚微、計紐約現貨跌半分、期價無漲跌、橫濱現貨漲二元、期貨跌二元、國內外絲經交易均寂、白廠祗達昌洋行進雙豹十件、用戶方面白廠去路堅呆、反不若山東黃經活躍、洋莊挽手司、昨信孚續有售開、價格較前漲二元許、共成交一百四十五件云、</p>
<h3>縣珠茶交易暢達</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、　縣莊之蝦目珠茶、同孚協和等行、紛起開辦、市盤開出七十八九元、較前無甚上落、惟去路頗有繼續暢銷之望、路莊珍眉綠茶、高莊復見走動、中低莊貨、依然呆滯、針眉秀眉貢熙等項、亦無大宗銷路、紅茶市面、愈形冷落、惟英俄兩莊、尙見活動、昨共輸出三千餘箱鉅額云、</p>
<p>又據茶棧業公會報告云、昨各路珍眉、仍頗沉悶、惟高莊貨各行仍有辦意、且售價穩定、如四大名家之珠眉昨售與白頭行價百十四元、中莊貨各行雖有還盤、但因價苛、成交頗少、錦隆對七十五六元之屯珍、約有二百箱辦入、同孚對屯溪蝦目亦略有成交、平水茶大幫稍有動機、惟價較前已略減低、珍眉協和續進百餘件、價自廿九元至卅二元云、</p>
<h3>糖市　海南赤號盤升二角</h3>
<p>昨國產綿持等糖號盤依然堅挺、惟洋糖尙平軟、公會划盤二四粗砂白現貨呌二十二元、轉口貨六元七角、續有成交、東白現貨四號二十一元九角、八號二十一元四角、九號二十一元一角半、轉口貨四號（J）嘜六元七角、八號TK嘜六元五角半、TM嘜六元四角、本廠綿白振記·大華·金心等一號均二十元半、號貨有廣潮幫開出海南赤五百餘包、十二元五角、比升二角、沖提青八十五包、十一元六角、綿赤共三百包之譜、計源裕十五元一角、合昌德興十四元三角至一角、比升一二角、聞汕匯略見回好、為一千一百八十元、比前日升起二十元、海南赤　州輸入口、僅到四百餘包、成交近十三元、綿赤到貨亦稀、雲南輸到三百餘包、</p>
<h3>五金　厚鐵現貨勢將斷檔</h3>
<p>厚鐵自兵工廠玩具廠及機器廠等採辦以來、甚為俏俐、最近因某某等機關突然大批收買、以致市上流通貨有搜羅殆盡之勢、標準因之節節上升、刻市如二十四號（三十寸三十六寸）每箱沽一百四十元、比前好五元、二十六號（三十寸）三十六寸每箱沽九十元、比前亦好七八元之譜、而一種野雞貨、每箱（七十張重二百磅）沽七十元、因正號貨軋缺、故客幫及廠家等均盡量收買、查昨市開出一百餘箱、是以行情亦有繼續看好之勢云、</p>
<h3>南北貨　漳州枝開價頻跌　海南圓肉首批到四件</h3>
<p>昨漳州枝、因行盤揀貨蘭竹賤卸於前、而產價電訊報跌於後、故至下午、號方開盤、市勢萎靡不振、普通貨竟小三四元、其餘烏葉枝因到少、降度不多、後市如銷路暢達、方有回好之望、否則尙難穩定云、</p>
<p>新海南圓肉、昨聞首批貨、號家已有四件運到、尙未見樣、大約今明可以開盤、</p>

<p>我會經看見過一個失敗的慈善家。對於她，這挫折似乎用了不能補救的打擊使她迷惑，混亂，終於陷入無由自解的哀愁裏。她呌做周二奶奶，就住任中華中路（一條在廣州以買賣故衣的市集出名，恰等於上海的石路或吳淞路那樣的馬路）的某條橫街裏，身體肥胖，裝束上從頭上的耳挖到脚底下的布鞋都是很守舊的，做好事底目的不在帮助別人而在帮助自己的已有或未來的兒孫。</p>
<p>有一天的下午中華中路來了三四十個呌化子，都是本地和附近鄉村的人，誰也不知道他們會怎樣聚在一起而且從那兒跑到裏這來。他們底衣服——更正確地說應該是些破爛的布袋和布片，已經失去了衣服原來的意義而變成一绺绺的隨意安排，毫無規則的身上的裝飾品，把他們身體上的各部份敞露出來，骨頭，不旺盛的體毛，瘡癲，腐爛的肉瘤，像馬匹和野狗一樣的生殖器官。</p>
<p>這是冬天，他們像一隊疲倦了的，全由男子組成的長途步行者似地坐在鋪滿太陽的一堵白牆下面高聲說笑，嘆氣，唱歌和呌罵。崗警是一個害眼病的年輕人，他借了一家商號底電話向警署報告過這件事，於是站在那堆呌化子旁邊，用手帕握住眼睛，裝出對他們全不在意的樣子。警署底措置辦法是怎樣的呢？—有人問他而他只是搖着頭，表示他埠願意說，因此我猜想也許是那樣的一種難以執行的命令：</p>
<p>「你這混蛋！難道他們會一輩子坐在你底崗位裏不走開的麼？——留心他們什麼時候走開，或者你想法子趕走他們……」</p>
<p>周二奶奶提着一個竹筐子跑來了。她底焦急和哀憐的神態彷彿她正提着一枝銅頭的帆布喉管奔向火塲去，脚不擇路地走着，卽在這樣勇猛的塲合她那肥胖的肢體仍然蹣跚得和一頭鵝母一樣。她和兩旁人行路店家底伙計們大聲說話，每次她臉上的五官一擠動就使人看得出油液從她底每一個毛孔沁漏出來竹。筐裏盛着一捲十塊錢的綫角子，——那是五十個雙毫。在廣州人們習慣把十塊錢捲成雞脖子那麼粗細的一捲。周二奶奶在呌化子面前把銀毫拆開，命令那些奇形怪相的男人站着不許走動，然後按人丁一個一個地分派她底施與。</p>
<p>銀角子被抖散和抓扒的時候發出淸脆的鳴聲——這聲昔震服了那些受鄙視的下賤的生物，他們立刻變成有秩序的良好的市民了。周二奶奶異常欣悅地穿着他們中間走，說話的聲音猶如她在唱甜蜜的歌句。</p>
<p>「你哪，你一個哪！</p>
<p>你哪，你又一個哪！」</p>
<p>但分派到第十七個的時候，她受了欺騙，失去了她底莊嚴，欣悅與和諧。</p>
<p>「你這個賤骨頭！你這個『葬山邊」！我認得你，你剛剛拿過我兩毛錢的，怎麼又來了呢？」</p>
<p>她罵那個呌化子。而從那堆廢物一般的男子中間，同時有人呌着：</p>
<p>「他呢？他呢？漆頭林也是分了第二回的！」漆頭林</p>
<p>（這是一個含有侮辱意味的花名）和那呌嚷的人首先互相毆打起來。</p>
<p>周二奶底神聖而快樂的感情被擊破了，彷彿在餵狗的時候被狗咬傷了似地，舉起手打了那第十七個呌化子。她不假思素地懲罰了那個惡徒是因為他底貧心破壞了這純潔的一切。</p>
<p>呌化子們動手搶奪那些銀毫，兇狠地撞碰着，扭纏着，形成一個大的混亂的衝突了。有些人把角子拋到遠遠的地方，大家向牠追趕，有些人橫直地爬在地上，一個壓在一個上面，有些繼續着互相出其不意地，然而頻頻地撞碰，跌倒。</p>
<p>周二奶奶把什麼都喪失乾凈了然後由那害眼病的警察將她從人叢中拔出來。她站在那由她引起了糾紛，現在誰也沒有法子呌他們回復平靜的混戰着的人們旁邊，頓着脚呌罵着。兩旁人行路店家底伙計們望着這無法收拾的景象大笑起來了。……</p>
<h3>賈湯罐</h3>
<p>— 尹光</p>
<p>這是一個十分健康的老人，留着一劃尖銳而雪白的鬍子，臉孔像孩童的一般的飽滿，發閃，只是生滿了縐紋，黃里帶黑，看來好像培製過的黃蓮一樣。不管兩三個自命為懂得幽默的年輕人，一望見他走進茶館，就免不了唏開嘴笑，抿一抿嘴唇，其實在縣城里，老實兒還算是聲望極好的人。他在縣里當了十五六年的公事，但在功名上他不過是一個監生，一淸察起他的低葛來，却又並非甚麼重要脚色的「老表的老表」單就這一點看，我們也可以知道輕視他是怎樣毫無理由的了。</p>
<p>這或許是所謂老運吧，他無聲無臭地活到將近六十歲的年齡，才開始在縣里的政治舞臺上出現，而且竟是那樣地突然，就是他自己也有點相信不過。那時全縣當政的正是陳三代五，一個狡猾刻毒的漢子，大前是拔貢，本人住過幾天官班法政，兄弟是出名的前老會的頭目，憑着這幾種勢力，一年秋天，他終於打倒了，他那渾名瘋子舉人的政敵，於是老頭兒也就開始了他的政治生涯</p>
<p>原來三代五一上臺，幾個機關法曉的首腦人物，有的自鳴情高，有的和瘋子舉人的關係太深，都一致取了不合作主義，陸續辭職了，對於繼任的人，有的他不放心他們，有的他們又不放心他，這使得他好為難。但是一天早上，他正蹲在圈椅上吹水烟，感到懊喪，却忽然把手掌在額頭上一拍，大笑着自言自語道，「我怎麼把賈湯罐忘記了！」於是從這次起首，一直到死，老頭子很少在他那農會會長的位子上動搖一下，彷彿那是一種終身職位一樣。</p>
<p>他的為人很和氣，時常總是笑迷迷的，閃着聰明而溫和的眼色。他對甚麼人部談得上幾句，雖然不多，却也不會使你頭痛。生氣和急燥是和他沒緣的，他那全部性格的特徵，似乎就只算他的安祥和開脫了。他有一個兒子，人很漂亮，住過三個月陸軍小學，但在他剛滿花甲時死掉了，卽連這也并沒有使他激動多少。半年以後，他還不慌不忙地把一個使女收上房，說是，「這樣方便一些。」</p>
<p>這事以後，每當人間起他怎麼會像中年人一樣的健康呢，他便十分酣暢地笑一笑，用指頭據一攄鬍子的尖端，於是故作正經地答道，你不配得死書上講過嗎：「小，補之哉？」他的笑容又立刻在臉上佈滿了。</p>
<p>他的家景并不豐裕，僅僅有佃客每年送來的兩三石糙米好吃，房子是租個的，可是他却生活得很安適，沒有甚麼奢望，對於一般不乾凈的錢財，更是不願意沾手；也正因為這一點，縣城里公事上幾决關於財政上的污濁的糾紛，他連證人都沒有做過。他認為不應該放手的，單只一筆正規的薪水。因為帶點義務性質，這筆錢是很小的，而且還不時鬧點拖欠。但卽使一連三個月地從地方收支所空起手回來，他也并不失望，他儘可以平心靜氣地去等待一種機會：當那些各地方機關的主管入，發起一分公文來要他蓋章時，他只需白着白眼地多和他們談幾句天，氣就得了。原來依照老頭子的習慣，是一見着馬封筒子，就會毫不打閃地摸出他那壽山石的私章來的。甚至有些不知道他的脾味的人，為了名分和責任起見，一定要他看一看公事的內容，他也會加以拒絕。</p>
<p>「我不看」，他搖着頭微笑道：「我給你們蓋章好了」。於是他極隨便地在自己的台銜下蓋上一顆印章。</p>
<p>他這樣樸實的舉動，倘是換一個人，那一定會立刻引起對手方的不舒服來的，但對於他，却從來少有過。因為天地間儘可以有着這樣一種人，他們平常總是難得出聲氣的，永遠默着聲息，顯出和氣的樣子，可是當他們冷不防一字一板地說出句句把話來時，第一分鐘你會禁不紅起臉來，覺得那些話里面是生了骨頭的，但當你下細一審視他們那聰明而坦白的眼色，便又有會自自然然地鬆一口氣，陪着他微笑了。老頭兒就恰是這種脚色。</p>
<p>而且在有些機會里，他那種脫扣而出，有點使沒經歷的人狼狽的言辭，還能引導出若干意想不到的實際效果來，不僅呌人覺得有趣。有一回在縣行政會議的席上，為了付加畝捐，兩個勢均力敵的政治首腦，一個不對勁，忽地拍起桌子爭執起來，甚至兩方的羽黨，己經準備動武了，這時候老頭兒不慌不忙地，用手指摸着茶碗，微笑道：「爭甚麼呵，橫豎要通過的！」於是大家都立刻縐了一下眉頭，但隨卽就禁不住失笑了。</p>
<p>縣行政會議開會時，他是每次都要列席的，雖然他從來很今發表意見。他總是挨着縣長坐在一起，默着聲兒　茶，有時望一望那些高喉大榮地陳訴着意見的與會者，　是又立刻莊視着自己的茶碗笑一笑，彷彿他是來旁聽的人，或者是應景的東西一樣。不過每當把一椿讓案提付表决時，他也不會忘掉舉一舉手　，而且還從來沒有不舉手贊成的事。雖然他和那些偏僻小鎭上來赴會的代表權似，很多的時候並不淸楚他們表示贊成的議案的內容，所不同的，那些老實而膽小的鄉紳，在散會後，總要拍着別人的肩頭問一問，「唉，剛才通過的是甚麼呀？」而在舉起手來時，還要瞻一瞻別的與會者，若是舉手贊成的人太少，或是他們認為重要的人物依舊在唏里嘩啦地吹着水烟的時候，便又紅着臉忸忸怩怩地趕緊把手臂拖下來，老頭子却並不這樣，他只要表示贊成，就好像萬事告了了。</p>
<p>對於別的集會，如像歡迎新到任的長官之類他也很少缺席；尤其是各種宴會。在每一種宴會上，他總是坐首席，而且一上桌子，總是忘不掉一面笑嘻嘻地從懷里拖出一張己經變色的白色手巾來，一面自言自語道：「讓我給我那個孫兒子帶點回去。」於是從從容容地把手同那些水果和各種臘菜盤盞里伸去。</p>
<p>他是在五年前去世的。他的死給幾個地位重要的人物帶來很大的不方便，每當他們為要解决各機關法團的人選而到苦惱時，總會記起他來，於是生氣道：「龜兒子！要是賈湯罐不死也好哩」？</p>

<h3>高爾基的葬禮</h3>
<p>— 戈寳權</p>
<p>六月十八日在蘇聯是一個休息日（註），同時也是一個非常不幸的日子；就是在這一天的上午十一時十分蘇聯的大文豪瑪克辛·高爾基（Maxin　Gorky）因久病而在莫斯科附近的別莊中瞑目長逝了。自從蘇聯的黨中央委員會及人民委員會宣佈了這一個不幸消息之後，莫斯科頓成了一個悲哀的城市，沿街到處的墻壁，都揷上紅底黑邊的喪旗；書店的櫥窗中也陳列出高爾基的著作，畫像及銅像等：戲院則取消了表演的劇目；文化與木息公園也臨時停止開放；均對於這位偉大的作家之死，表示普遍的哀忱。</p>
<p>到了十九日的淸農，報紙上俱用大字印着高爾基逝世的消息，並載有羅曼羅蘭，簫伯訥，威爾斯等人的唁電，以及列寗夫人，季德及其他蘇聯作家們所寫的哀悼及紀念的文字。舉如眞理報的社論中說：高爾基的逝世，有如「理智的明燈熄滅了」一樣：文末又說：「偉大的是高爾基的天才，偉大的是他對於新人類的服役；他的光輝的名字，將永不會為萊提河（Lethe）的綏流—忘川之水—所湮沒。這位偉大的俄羅斯的作家，文字的光輝的藝術家，勞動者的擎友，及為建設新社會的勝利而鬥爭的武士的名字，將永遠地昭如日星，留存於人類的記憶中，重千古而不朽！」羅學難蘭的唁電非常之簡短，就是這樣的兩三旬話：「對於我們的親愛的友人的逝世，我眞是無法能形容出我是怎樣的傷心，我們現在也同樣的分擔了蘇聯人民們的悲哀。一蕭伯訥則說：「和他同時代的十九世紀的作家，從此又弱了一個。」蘇聯作家阿勒克賽·托爾斯泰（Aexei　Tolstoy）所寫的一段紀念的文字中，則有這樣的話：「三大革命時代的光明從此黑暗了，俄羅斯最後的一位偉人的作家離開了我們而去。由於他的藝術，革命前期文學最好的傳統，其最崇高的人道觀念，及其愛好，感覺及理解入類心靈的能力，方能與尙在年靑時代的蘇聯文學相聯繫。他是我們的—嚴肅而不妥協約——領袖。從藝術方面，他還要求更高的服役。他也是蘇聯的人道主義的創始者。」</p>
<p>高爾基逝世的地方，是在距離莫斯科不遠的高爾基村中。其遺體則於當日運送至莫斯科，舉行國葬典禮。蘇聯政府並組織有國家治喪處，處理一切治喪事宜。從十九日上午九時起，高爾基的遺體卽先陳於工會大厦（House　of　TradeUnions）的圓柱廳中，任人前往哀悼。當日工會大厦的門前，懸着高爾基的畫像及四面大喪旗：圓柱廳的中央則是高爾基的遺體，四週俱放滿了鮮花及花圈等，廳中並有樂隊奏悲多汶，蕭邦及克萊格等人的葬禮進行曲。遺體之旁，時立有政府的要人著名作家及各地的代表等，任榮譽守衛人（Guard　of　Honour）。舉如史大林，莫洛托夫，奧爾宗尼吉哉（Orjonikdze）及安德萊夫（Andreyea）等人，卽曾於當日下午四時半，前往哀悼，並立於造體旁數分錡之久。當天莫斯科的無綫電台，也停止播送各種節目，整天所聽到的，俱是悲愴的哀樂及蘇聯作家們所論談的哀悼的詩文等。羣衆們從早晨八九點鐘起，卽排隊前往工會大厦，以期能一瞻仰高爾基最後的遺容。到了當日的午後，羣衆更是愈衆愈多，靠近工會大厦的高爾基街，大德密特洛夫卡街（Bolshayamirovka）及彼得洛夫卡街（Pefrovka），俱臨時斷絕了交通，羣衆所排的隊伍延長至數里之遠，統計當日行經高爾基遺體之前的羣衆，的在一二十萬人以上，從此也就可以看出蘇聯的人民是怎樣敬重高爾基。</p>
<p>高爾基的遺體於當夜火葬，屍灰則盛於一小銅罐中，從二十日的上午九時起，仍陳於工會大厦的圓柱廳中，任人前往追悼，以迄葬禮舉行之前為止。葬禮係在莫斯科中心的紅塲舉行，紅塲與工會大厦相距甚近，臨時沿途俱排滿了軍警及羣衆，凡參與葬禮的人，須持有通行證方可前往紅塲。以五時半起，葬禮開始，史大林，莫洛托夫，卡岡諾維區（Kaganvich）及奧爾宗尼哉等四人，先立於高爾基的屍灰之旁，任最後的榮譽守衛人、繼而就在國際歇的音樂聲中，抬安置屍灰罐的小方亭前往紅場、在亭前，有人捧　高爾基的遺像及一個紅色的小方枕，枕上有一個蘇聯政府獎給高爾基的列寗勳章；在亭後，則俱為高爾基的家屬，政府要人及作等家。</p>
<p>當葬禮行列前往紅塲時，沿途俱有軍樂隊奏葬禮進行曲；及至到了紅塲，卽先將安置屍灰罐的小方亭，息於列寗墓前的一張紅布案上。史大林等入卽於此時走上了列寗墓，開始舉行追悼儀式。莫洛托夫先代表政府及黨中央執行委員會演講，在演講中，莫洛托夫說；「自列寗以後，高爾基的逝世，實是蘇聯及全人類的一個莫大的損失。」繼而布爾加林（Bulgnmin）代表莫斯科的蘇維埃及莫斯科省黨委員會演講，阿勒克賽·托爾斯泰代表蘇聯作家聯合會演講，最後就是季德的法文演講。季德說：「高爾基的逝世，不僅是蘇聯的不幸，　是全世界的不辛。因為有了高爾基，俄羅斯人民的况痛而偉大的呼聲，方在遠近諸國得到了一個回響。所以我現在此地所要表示的，不僅是我個人的悲哀，而是法國文學界的悲哀，全歐洲文化界的悲哀，及全世界文化界的悲哀。」最後榮德又說：「高爾基一生所負擔的最偉大而最光榮的任務，就是聯繫了新舊兩個世界，同時又在新世界與未來的世界之間，架上了一座橋樑。他曾目賭過昨日以前的種種壓迫及悲劇的鬥爭，他又曾運用了他的力量而助成今日的勝利。他代表過那許多不能發表意見的人而發言。使得他們的聲音，遐邇告聞。從現在起，高爾基已是屬於歷史上的人物，而成為永久的偉大的人物之一了。」</p>
<p>演講完畢後，史大林及托爾斯泰等人，卽又抬屍灰亭，繞經列寗墓的右翼，而至墓後的克里來林宮（Kremin）牆前。舉凡蘇聯的革命家及政府要人，以及客死於莫斯科做外國革命志士，俱葬於此地。高爾基的屍灰罐，則於國際歌及二十一響的禮砲聲中，置入宕牆。現在宕牆上裝有一塊黑色的方牌，上面寫着：「阿勒克賽·瑪克西冒維區·高爾基。生於一八六八年三月二十八日，死於一九三六年六月十八日」。</p>
<p>當此高爾基逝世之時，不妨在此的略講一講高爾基的生平。高爾基原名阿勒克賽·瑪克西冒維區·拜西科夫（Alexei　Maxinsvichpeshkov），於一八六八年三月二十八日生於尼幾尼·羅弗哥羅城（Nizhuy　Novgorod現名高爾基城。），瑪克辛·高爾基則是他後來著作時所用的筆名。他的父親是位木匠，母親是位染坊主人的女兒，均於高爾基年幼時去世，所以高爾基大牛的時間是跟隨着外祖父及外祖母過活。八歲時，曾進過小學校，但是學校中的課程並不能引起他的什麼興趣，加以家庭淸寒，這樣過了一兩年，卽又輟學，而被送到一家鞋匠店去當學徒。關於在外祖父家及讀書時的生活，俱詳見他所寫的實年時代書中。</p>
<p>從十二歲起高爾基就開始了流蕩的生活。最初先在伏爾加河的一個輪船上當洗碗碟的職務。這時候，輪船上有一位廚司，常常要高爾基讀小說給他聽，據高爾基自己說：這實在是引起他對於文學發生愛好的第一個人。離開了輪船之後，他又曾在神像舖中當過學徒和在一家建築工廠裏當過小監工；工作之暇，則還是繼續不斷地動於閱讀文學書籍。到了十歲，他就往喀山（Kazan）去，想進當地的大學讀書；但是這個美麗的夢想，終成泡影，結果還是過着流蕩的生活，到碼頭上去做脚伕，和到麵包店中去當學徒。在這個時期中高爾基已與先進的智識階級及從事革命工作的人有來往，同時又親身經歷過各種下層社會階級的生活，所以高爾基說：這就是他所受的敎育，這也就是他的「大學」。</p>
<p>到了一八九一年，高爾基又流蕩到高加素的梯夫里斯（Tifis）去翌年九月，就在高加索報（Kavkaz）發表了他的第一篇處女作，這可說是他從事文學生活之始。同年底，他又回到他的故鄉去，得到文學家柯羅倫科（Korolenko）的提拔及帮助，就正式從事於文學生涯，而漸在文壇上享有盛名。從這時候起，高爾基除於著作之外，又參加革命運動，先後曾被逮捕及放逐過多次，就是後來亡命國外時，他仍然是繼續着從事革命工作，而成為列寗的摯友之一。當一九三二年時，是高兩基從事文學生涯的四十年，蘇聯政府曾舉行盛大的紀念會，以示慶祝。</p>
<p>高爾基一生的著作，小說中可以童年時代，我的大學，人世間母親及克林·莎姆金的一生（TheLife　of　KlinoSomgin）等小說為代表·克林·莎姆金的一生已出有三卷，第四卷則在他逝世之前，方全部寫完。劇本中可以市民，底層，仇敵，葉戈爾·布里喬夫及其他Egor　Bulichevandothers）等劇為代表。</p>
<p>高爾基逝世後，其頭腦卽交莫斯科的頭腦研究院解剖研究：其遺著則山政府所組織的高爾基遺著委員會，編輯發行；莫斯科，列寗格勒及高爾基等三城中，則擬建立高爾基的銅像；列寗格勒的國家文藝書籍出版局並設有高爾基文學獎金，鼓勵蘇聯的作家從事著作。關於高爾基的著作，當大革命之前，卽已銷行八十萬本；從大革命之初以迄最近為止，各民族文字的版本，共有一百五十種，俄文的版本共有三百八十七種，其總銷數在三千一百萬册以上；現蘇聯各出版局，又將大量的編印新全集及各種普及的版本等，從此就可以看出高爾基的著作的流行之廣泛及閱讀之普遍。現高爾基已是長逝，回想到他的一生，怎樣從一個流蕩者而成為位世界著名的作家，這種刻苦及奮鬥的精神，實値得我們敬佩。至於他的著作，則也將永垂不朽，成為世界文學史上的重要的界石之一。</p>
<p>（註）蘇聯採用六日週制，卽工作制日休息一日。每月逢初六，十二，十八，二十四及三十等日，俱為休息日</p>
<p>高爾基之遺體，陳於工會大廈之圓桂廳任人前往瞻禮。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>大學中蒼蠅命案</h3>
<p>— 我</p>
<p>浙人李敢與粵人何蒼雲，在聖的翰大學讀書，本月十五日，李敢向廚房中購買蛋炒飯一客，李進食甫半，忽發覺飯中蒼蠅一只，乃向廚房交涉，其時廚房寫賬員鄭金海，正與廚房老闆張源泉算賬，檯上置有大小法幣，李乃隨手取得法幣一元，謂暫作抵押品，嗣後張源泉向李索還一元，致起口角，張指李為强盜，搶刦銀洋五元，致觸李怒，何蒼雲卽上前將張頸項猛擊一拳，張忽受傷倒地，當送院醫治，竟無效而死，前日解由第一特院刑庭審訊，何李對於拳擊一層，尙在否認中，此案事實的經過，披露於報上者如是，該案旣由法院審訊，其中事實究屬如何，尙待法院之偵查，該生等瞧負刑事上何種責任，自有法庭判斷，筆者原不必曉舌，我所欲談者，便是學生的人格修養問題。</p>
<p>現在姑且拿該事實為眞實來說，該命案造成的原因，第一由於該廚房並不注意衛生，致蛋飯中發現蒼蠅一只，則該廚房對於玩忽業務之咎，亦屬難辭，第二由於該生攫取法幣一元，事後索還，遂致造成目前之慘劇，故第一之咎，咎在廚房，而第二之咎，咎在學生，查各校廚役，大抵馬虎者多，而能講究衛生，實行淸潔運動者，殊屬少數之允少數，故校中發現類似蒼蠅的風潮，原屬不少槪見，該學生應該報告學校當局，把該廚房懲戒一番，使以後不致再有同樣事端發生，卽算了事。</p>
<p>而該慘案之發生，乃由攫取一元法幣而起，此種行為，對於學生的人格方面，顯有非是，明知該學生之攫取一元，並非貪其財物，實是一種玩弄性質，若說一元為抵押品，難道學生的生命，僅値得一元麼？若謂貪其財物，何以該學生僅取一元而已足？總之該學生攫取一元為押品之舉，非但竟因此而造成慘案，原非意料所及，卽使不發生命案，亦到底有傷學生的人格。</p>
<p>因此我對於此次該學生之行動，而得到一個敎訓，學生血氣方剛，恃强逞兇，往往意氣用事，不肯審慎考慮，一拳打出，性命鳴呼，到此縮手，已來不及，試問造因不過一只蒼蠅，攫取亦只有一元法幣，而竟至造成此種不幸之結果，豈是學生腦筋中所及料者，蓋學生之對於該廚房，素無深醫宿怨，决無定欲致其死命之理，而竟於不知不覺之中竟「闖下了彌天禍」，靑年做事，千萬不可鹵莽，於此可見一斑。</p>
<h3>歌女柳春</h3>
<p>— 劉子明</p>
<p>太陽已經高高地懸在頭頂，柳春房里還是靜悄悄地沒有一點聲息。她媽曾幾决在房門口走動，但恐怕驚擾女兒的好夢，都祗是一探頭，瞧見帳門垂着，就回身走了。</p>
<p>柳春是飛仙閣上的歌女，因為她生得漂亮，又會應付客人，那些化錢的老爺少爺一高興，柳春棒成飛仙閣上的紅歌女了。每天她上台，點唱的水牌總是連一接二地褂起來，她常常唱得嗓子發啞。雖然那些客人並不在乎她的唱，可是同伴們却嫉妬起來，在後台故意高聲說壞話諷刺她。在台前柳春受着客人的掌聲，喝采，在後台她却是孤獨的。她常常想有一個機會向她的姊妹們剖白她的苦衷，但是因為她是一個紅歌女，在同伴之間她們己經築起了深深地的鴻溝，她們把她敵人一樣看待，她祗能露着笑臉去博客人的歡心，不能得到同命運的姊妹們的同情。她是寂寞地，孤獨地生活着。</p>
<p>是前天的事，她一下臺，老闆已在後臺守候着了。</p>
<p>「辛苦辛苦，柳姑娘。」老闆聳着肩頭，親自替柳春擰手巾。自然，那是普遍的現象，老闆對於他的搖錢樹總是特別殷勤的。但是那天的情形顯得特別一點，老闆一直等着柳春卸了裝，又鬼鬼祟祟附着她的耳朶說：</p>
<p>「幾位老爺邀柳姑娘去游湖，他們在門外等你，請你賞光。」</p>
<p>柳春沒有回答，向老闆盯了一眼，老闆誤會了她的意思，又是低聲小氣地：「就是今天點三十齣戲的那張桌子上的。」</p>
<p>「×老闆，」柳春幾乎想笑了，「你沒有知道這里的規矩嗎？請你去謝謝他們，做歌女是沒有這種福氣的！」</p>
<p>老闆走緊一步，打着哈哈，他的面孔彷彿映在哈哈鏡里一樣，像一頭獅子狗，說話也放得高聲一點：</p>
<p>「柳姑娘，你眞不知道這個，他們都是做官的，什麼科長部長都有，伴着他們遊湖還怕誰？」他又逼緊一步，和柳春此着高矮似的，「他們化錢都是不在乎的，你看，不是一點就是三十齣嗎？柳姑娘，恭喜你啊！哈哈哈……」</p>
<p>沒有等得柳春答話，老闆一路笑着到客人面前去覆信了。柳春彷彿失了知覺似的，垂着頭跟在他後面。門外有四五個人等着，瞧見老闆背後的柳春，大家搶上前來喊着「柳姑娘賞光」！（如果你閉上眼睛想一想，我們常常可以在舞台上看到那種滑稽表演的。）</p>
<p>夏天的夜特別短，柳春回到家裏將要天光發白了。她喝得微微有點醉意，面孔是緋紅的，手掌裏滲着冷汗，她糊裏糊塗地走下汽車，當她媽來開門的時侯，她一仆身跌在老婆子的懷抱裏了。</p>
<p>下一天柳春生病了，日塲請了假。老闆慌着坐車子到她家裏，帶來幾種西藥，又請了一個著名的醫來診治。醫生說是受了凉，靜養幾天就會好的。</p>
<p>但是飛仙閣沒有柳春就不能做生意，日塲掛了柳春病假的牌子，那些客人沒有坐定都打了回票，更有許多人問着夜塲登臺不登臺？</p>
<p>老闆到吃夜飯還沒有離開柳春的踱室，他儘是反剪着手踱圈子，彷彿這樣柳春馬上會從床上跳起來似的。看看飛仙閣將是上塲的時侯了，一個小伙計在外面等着柳春登臺不登臺的消息。老闆終於拉了柳春的媽說了半天話：又由她對女兒說了半天話，在最後十分鐘老闆坐汽車帶着柳春上飛仙閣來了。</p>
<p>回來時，柳春面色蒼白，寒熱愈來愈高，在床上翻來覆去不能睡穩，服了藥，到天明才睡去。</p>
<p>吃過中飯，老闆又來了，柳春的媽不得不到房里去喊醒她的女兒。柳春的熱度仍沒有退，兩頰紅紅的，全身冒着汗，她一眼瞧着老闆，翻身向里床睡去了。</p>
<p>老闆小心地坐到床沿上，伸過手去試了試她的額角。</p>
<p>「柳姑娘，不要生氣，自己身子要緊。說起來都是我不好，但是吃了這碗把勢飯有什麼辦法呢？他們做官的，我×某的飛仙閣好給她碰嗎？柳姑娘，日塲我已掛出請假牌子了，好好地保養，到晚上再看罷。飛仙閣是靠着柳姑娘的，……」</p>
<p>柳春不由得哭起來了：老闆同情她嗎？决不的，客人是玩弄着她，老闆是利用着她，而那些姊妹們又嫉妬着她，她沒有愛護她的人，沒有同情她的入，不過生得漂亮，年輕，出賣着自己的靈魂！她想到將來，可以一輩了做歌女嗎</p>
<p>「媽，」她喊了起來，「我不能吃這碗把勢飯了！不能吃這碗把勢飯了！」</p>
<p>媽掛着兩行眼淚，撫着她的炙熱的面頰，「孩子，靜一點，身體要緊，不要胡思亂想……」老婆子自己却想起了死去的丈夫，死去的兒子，她祇有這末一個女兒了，她希望女兒好好地嫁一份人家，但是做歌女是出路嗎？</p>
<h3>山城雜寫</h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>意外的，我們這一夥耽擱在這山城里。</p>
<p>從早晨一直到日暮，看看天，總是一副不高興的臉，日頭，這兩天很難享受得到。客棧里的霉濕氣，不住的衝進了鼻管，混合的惡臭，會使你感到要打噁心，在途程里我們所不高興的太陽，現在企望着牠能露出了惡毒的臉凶狠的照射着每一個陰暗的角落，使埋藏在角落里的墊魅都全部的滅跡。</p>
<p>住慣了都市旅舍的人，絕對的想不到那山城客棧的沉悶，低氣壓由進門的櫃台直到後院，不但聽不到牌聲笑語，甚至述同住的旅人也都找不到，寂寞包圍了整個的店子，有被窒碍着咽喉一樣的苦澀。</p>
<p>遼遠的山巔，模糊得像紗霧一樣壓</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>着域樓的牆垜，混沌，表現着時間交到了傍晚，重决的，亦嘗不到不願意走過的石子路上。眞的，在今天，該說是有些許的收獲吧？</p>
<p>往常，當黃昏的時際，那比較熱鬧的地區，左邊或者是右邊，經常的總可以看到排者幾面小桌子，拉上褪了色的紅臬圍，上面，擺設着筆墨之類的文寳，還有些香燭之類的小供設，看上去，那桌面有相當的複雜，但是，不能十分的看得淸晣，那桌子的下面熱得很高，超過了人們的視綫。一頭，還放了發本書，疊得高高地，那樣子，却有些像上海的測字攤，但是看不見人。</p>
<p>起初，奇怪的念頭不住的動，為什麼看不見人呢？為什麼要把桌子墊得那樣高呢？問問阿黃，也得不到肯確的解答，思想：也許是求神問卜吧？也許是代寫家信公文吧？也許是說書賣卦吧？誰又能斷定。像謎一樣壓在心頭有好幾天，都不能够打破。今天，機會該多凑巧呵，十幾個人圍在桌下，一位有鬍鬚的長者正在引證了書本講述格言，臘燭燃起了紅紅地光燄，射到老者的臉上，瘦弱的程度是可以的。</p>
<p>可是遠地的旅者聽不懂當地的方言，那老老所講述的究竟是些什麼！我不能知道，樣子却表現着相當的莊電。一個意念溜上心頭，說不定這是什麼會裏宣敎的一種吧？於此直覺到佈道力量的偉大，同時，對於這周密的設施，不能不引起了極大的敬佩。</p>
<p>晚了，客棧的飯食，辣得不能進口，走上丁字街口的那家大茶館，晚飯是不愁解决的，泡壺茶，裝一盤肉心的大飽子，至多，再來上一兩碗羊肉粉，等敎你能挺了肚子回去，以此，生意的興旺，並不亞於上海的什麼茶室的。</p>
<p>茶館裏，在不阻碍視綫的牆端或是柱上，除了貼些銀錢當心和衣帽自理的條子外，莫談國事一類的字句却少看見，雖則人並不少，但話題大多是些家常瑣碎和商務經營，對於國事彷彿都與他們絕了綠。本來，交通攔搪了外間的文化，在文化水舉不能提高的山城，對於外有的一切，又怎能去領略呢？</p>
<h3>長程的壯者</h3>
<p>— 莊瑞源</p>
<p>在容貌上，言行上，因為跟弟弟有幾分彷彿，曾鬧出絕大的誤會。這以外，我們的廻異眞是太多了。尤其是在性情和志趣上，我們是勢不相容的對敵。</p>
<p>一向處在一起的我們，他一向只有無言的沉默，不，他只有仇視，陰謀和對於我的不利的行為。我知道弟弟的性情和志趣。我沒有什麼怨允。每决我用着自己的手指熨平了我的額面的憂戚，也試探着熨平他的額面的憂戚；可是我的用心全是枉然的，反而增長了他的仇視，陰謀，和增多了對於我的不利的行為</p>
<p>於是，各人私自組成的世界，是互相隔離得很遠很遠。雖然我們有同一的創傷，然而始終沒有互相申訴而作為一種慰安，一種憑藉。</p>
<p>在冬天的夜裏，我們無言地喝了一此水，來潤澤各人因為爐火而乾洞起來的嗓門。但是却從來不會為着有潤澤了的嗓而輕易打破我們之問的寂寞。</p>
<p>我們走着多麼疲倦的長程呵！</p>
<p>只有時，我們却這樣頹然地嘆息了，用着同樣疲累的聲調。是的，我們同樣淸楚地暸解我們的途程，而偏是那麼陌生而不幸的兩個旅途的伴者呀！　我會隱忍了一切難耐的顫抖，試探着扶掖年輕的弟弟走我們荊棘的路。我不會有什麼怨允，慍色和追悔。為着弟弟的綠故，我讓他有過問我的一切的權利。在孤寂的長途上，伴着他的哥哥同行着，對於他該是有益的呵。</p>
<p>我不休止地照顧着他，安撫着他，牽住他的手讓他不撇下我而去。一切是為着弟弟的綠故。</p>
<p>可是，他，一個在性情上和志趣上與我作對的人，却報復我用仇視，陰謀和對於我不利的行為。他拚命地掙脫了他的手，他要脫離我的照護，他毅然地承担了一切困難而繁複的抱負。他留下去這樣堅决的話：</p>
<p>「去罷！我憎厭你，你的陪件又是我的一種抱負。我要單獨地到外邊去，為自己而追尋，磨難，甚至為自己而毀滅。而你也應該自己去摸索你的途徑！」　這樣，弟弟便走離了我，而且隔開得更遠更遠。我知道，在風塵載道的長途上，弟弟還是掙扎着，永遠為自己而追尋，磨難，甚至為自己而毀滅。在他的額間，那曾經給我的手指熨平的憂戚也許早已消失了。他在沙漠上會笑，會唱歌，沒有憂愁的痛苦吧！</p>
<p>可是在我，曾經熨平過的憂戚又在額間存在着了，因為失去了弟弟。雖則，我們同樣淸楚地暸解我們的途程，而偏是那麼陌生而不幸的兩個旅途的伴者呵！」</p>
<p>「可是，回來吧！弟弟。」</p>
<p>在風雪中，在沙塵中，我低垂了臉，感覺全然地疲累了。我祗低低地咀嚼着這句過時的話。</p>
<p>播音</p>
<h3>醉臥沙場</h3>
<p>葡萄美酒夜光杯，欲飲琵琶馬上催，醉臥沙場君莫笑，古來征戰幾人回，早屯古廟，夜宿荒郊，風蕭蕭，魚瀟瀟，酒興偏濃，向天長嘯，彈入鏜，刀出鞘，敵人來到，戰鼓鼙敲，不怕槍，不怕砲，一聲前進號，跳出戰塲，衝鋒將敵掃，宿醒猶未醒，血染征袍，殘敵已潛逃，勸君更進一杯酒，雲淡天高，星稀月耀，沙做枕頭烟做被，沙塲夢，夢迢迢。</p>

<h3>彈詞</h3>
<p>錢景章錢醉仙毛家書</p>
<p>中西（一〇四〇）上午十時至十時三刻</p>
<p>開篇「國花」</p>
<p>梅花雖不是花王。品格淸高出衆芳。自古詩人曾品定。花魁名譽世無雙。那菊是花中之隱逸。還稱君子亦相當。周子愛蓮陶愛菊。兩人志趣並非常。不知道，梅花隱逸兼君子。性淑品高貌亦莊。人世多稱桃李好。桃花艷冶李花香。那梅花。只安常。不願時髦學新妝。艷世風流無俗氣。羞與桃李鬥芬芳。無良媒。亦何傷。藐姑仙子本無郎。山中好友松與竹。夜半淸風月與霜。那凡卉只宜聽號令。誰能够先與占春光。所以說，新月舒眉衆星耀。老梅開口百花忙。天荒地老誰知己。只道人間目盡盲。却不料，多情還有林和靖。知音要說孟襄陽。而今國花推定更榮光。</p>
<p>何芸芳何琴芳雙珠球</p>
<p>麟記（一二二〇）下午二時一刻至三時</p>
<p>開篇「刁劉氏說情」</p>
<p>王文縲絏作拘囚。妻子關情日夜憂。不解理刑應意思。一無交涉而有仇。通監使費都難用。無可通融欠主謀。露水夫妻同意久。登門覿面試相求。刁家婦本劉家女。襄楚紳衾第一流。叨在鄰居能拜候。相逢同向內閨樓。股勤談笑寒溫畢。維恐拈酸主婢愁。徐氏傷悲劉氏窘。十分急迫十分羞。拙夫被捉當官去。銷禁監牢事不休。懇向尊翁言一句。勝與齋瞧佛前修。倘能釋放回家里。結草啣環生前酬。易見爹爹難見母。不將兒女面情留。還宜別處尋門路。恐不成功事不週。痛哭號呼無力敎。幸而左右衆丫頭。力勸歸禀父母去。縉紳文武半交游。婢子種情難自由。</p>
<p>周振玉義妖傳</p>
<p>元昌（一一二〇）午夜零時三刻至一時半</p>
<p>開篇「薛寳釵」</p>
<p>（咪咪集創刊號）</p>
<p>紅樓擬作小蓬萊。一種情痴十二釵。幽閨莫妙蘅蕪院。香草庭前滿地栽。好一位伶俐端莊薛寳釵。金陵</p>

<p>閥閱陶朱富。家遭不幸遇同懷。故而寄跡榮寗府。金王紅絲結鸞懷。還記那畫長偶步入怡紅院。見寳玉是睡午甜甘夢禾回。靜無聊偶而佔針指。綉鴛鴦權作襲人陪。那曉促狹頻兒在窗外窺。林了頭生性多疑忌。他道奴花前有意賦標梅。秦樓迷失吹簫客。一赴鄉塲今不回。紅顏少婦閨中泣。白髮慈親堂上哀。二載夫妻成畫餅。反不如早早短命赴泉台。寳姑娘正在心煩悶。鶯兒婢子送茶來。說道姑娘保重玉軀為第一。冷香丸在服莫傷悲。寳二爺指日回鄉井。孝廉公做了迷路小嬰孩。好夫妻包管兩和諧。</p>

<p>電影</p>
<h3>白玉霜沒有「打過圈」</h3>
<p>師長徐莘園到督軍署來見譚志遠督軍，嗅到督軍抽的雪茄烟香氣異常，要一支嘗嘗，督軍說：「這是領事送的，要合三塊錢一支呢，不能給你抽」。師長不客氣的動手在抽斗裏亂找，找到烟盒，開開一看，裏面盡是些女人的照片，上面有的打過圈，有的沒有，師長奇怪的問，督軍很幽默的答道：「打圈的就是打過圈的了」。聰明的師長已了解督軍的話：「哈哈哈哈，這到不壞，怎麼海棠紅（白玉霜）沒有打過圈呢」？這句話提醒了督軍，立時喊秘書長來，呌他把尙未打過圈的海棠紅啡來，秘害長連聲應諾，領命而去，督軍得意的稱讚秘書長：「秘書長辦這些事情的手段是有名的。」</p>
<h3>「到自然去」漫言</h3>
<p>由於一種虛矯的偽飾，人的本性早已經因之而泯減。在世界上，也許還有貧富階級之存在；但是，在原始的生活中，却只有生存的競爭，馮着自己的力，去創造，去享受。</p>
<p>由文明的，物質的世界，走向大自然中，有些人會感到人是一個廢物，但在另一些人看來，他却可以運用他的活力，去抵抗，去克服這大自然。</p>
<p>本質地講來，世界並沒有貧富階級之存在，那完全是人工的矯作；有的，只是智能的分野。</p>
<p>「到自然去」是以這主題寫成的。我們首先看到崇樓大厦錦衣美食的人們；當他們到一個荒島上，與外界完全斷絕的時候，他們是不能忍受這原的生活了，因為本身的低能，使他們忘記了階級的存在，而屈服於大自然的威力之下。但，當他們重行回到文明社會的時候，原始生活的敎訓就立刻忘懷了。</p>
<p>「到自然去」並不是要人們回到自然。卽使在文明的社會裏，也可以引用這原則，使這社會更自然一點，更人性一點，讓人們憑着各自的智能，獲得他應有的酬報。優勝劣敗，是自然的法則。</p>
<p>全劇完全浸潤在一種詩意的竟界之下，但這並不是烏托邦式的幻想；這是說明了天演淘汰的公理——人類是一種什麼的存在。</p>
<h3>「夜半歌聲」講劇情嚇壞了胡萍</h3>
<p>新華公司第二部出品「夜牛歌聲」，係一哀豔恐怖有聲音樂巨片，昨日下午五時在該公司攝影塲開講劇情，劇中主要演員如胡萍顧而已顧夢鶴施超黎明健李君磬陳雲等均蒞塲聽講，當導演馬徐維邦講至精彩處，在塲職演員咸具恐怖心理，均傾耳靜聽，正在空氣極形緊張之際，霹靂一聲電炬忽滅，頓時全塲漆黑，益覺陰森慘怖，且適大雨如注，雷聲如吼，演員胡萍竟出聲大啡，在塲各職演員一若置身劇中，更覺心驚胆戰，毛髮悚然，後經工友携洋燭來，人心稍定，忽女星中又有人大啡；「有怪有怪！」衆隨視之，則見塲中屋角處，發現兩只碩大無朋的巨眼，閃閃發光，一時秩序大亂，咸欲起身脫逃，幸大雨忽止，電燈復明，而所謂巨眼者，乃攝影塲兩只頂燈在作怪耳，一塲慮驚，至此方告平息，衆料本劇開講劇情時有此出人意料之恐怖空氣，必係將來成功之象微云。</p>

<h3>Yu Hanmou Arrives in Guangzhou, Li Bai to Assume New Post Soon, Guangdong Troops Newly Allocated Defense Areas, Li Pinxian Calls on Chiang to Discuss Post-Gui Affairs, Chen Ce, Chen Qingyun, etc. Arrive in Guangdong</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Central Government dispatched Qian Dajun, Huang Zhenqiu, and Tu Sizong to Guangdong as advisors for military affairs. On the 22nd, they flew from Nanjing to Shaoguan to confer with Yu Hanmou. On the morning of the 23rd, Yu Hanmou, accompanied by Qian Dajun and staff, arrived in the province in over twenty warplanes, landing at Tianhe Airport at 8:30 AM. Hundreds of people from the party, government, and military sectors welcomed them. Yu went to the Yantang Military Academy to meet with the generals remaining in the province. Miao Peinan, Lin Shiqing, Li Shuzong, and others reported on the situation after Chen Jitang's departure from Guangdong. Yu will move to the headquarters in a day or two to begin work. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The civilian ships previously seized for transporting troops to Wu Zhou have been returned. Zhang Renmin stated on the 23rd that he had met with Yu today to discuss the Guangdong-Guangxi issue. Since Guangdong has advocated peaceful unification, Guangxi cannot act differently alone. The Central Government has announced Li Bai as the principal and deputy directors; he should accept the position and assume office within days to demonstrate unity and unification. However, military post-affairs still await discussion and decision. Li Pinxian will be dispatched to Nanjing in the coming days to negotiate. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Guangdong troops have been newly allocated defense areas: the First Army will be stationed in the provincial capital and the West River area, the Second Army in the North River area, the Third and Fourth Armies in the East River area, and the Fifth Army in the Southern Route. (22nd-23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Yu Hanmou, the newly appointed Pacification Commissioner of Guangdong and Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Route Army, accompanied by Qian Dajun, Huang Zhenqiu, Li Xuhuan, and others, flew from Shaoguan to the provincial capital at 7:30 AM on the 23rd aboard Rongke aircraft number 1002. A total of twenty-one aircraft accompanied them, along with pilot Li Qihua and many others. They arrived at Tianhe Airport at 9:20 AM. Those who came to welcome them included Lin Yun'gai, Zou Lin, Miao Peinan, Song Ziliang, Tang Hai'an, as well as the remaining generals in the province and representatives from various institutions and organizations, totaling over a thousand people. Yu, dressed in a yellow military uniform, was in excellent spirits. After disembarking, he shook hands with each of the welcomers as a gesture of respect. He then returned to the newly established headquarters of the Fourth Route Army at the Yantang Military Academy to rest. He immediately summoned Miao Peinan, Li Shuzong, Lin Shiqing, and others for inquiries. It was also decided to hold a discussion meeting with the generals on the evening of the 23rd. Lin Yun'gai hosted a banquet at the provincial government's Western-style flower hall at 7:00 PM to welcome Yu. As the motorcade returned to headquarters, residents cheered and set off firecrackers, creating an extremely enthusiastic atmosphere. (23rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) After Yu Hanmou assumed office, the overall situation here immediately returned to normal. The mutiny of the salt affairs guard team has also been suppressed. (23rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Zhang Renmin, Chief of Staff of the Guangxi Army, issued a formal statement here today, stating that Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi have decided to obey the appointment of the Central Executive Committee and intend to immediately assume the positions of Principal and Deputy Pacification Commissioners of Guangxi Province. Li Pinxian has already departed for Nanjing to discuss the reorganization of Guangxi's military affairs. Zhang also visited Yu Hanmou today, expressing Guangxi's readiness to support Yu's unification policy to preserve the traditional friendly relations between Guangdong and Guangxi. (23rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) After arriving in the province, Yu Hanmou issued a proclamation: All measures taken by the Director in the future will be in accordance with the Central Government, working diligently to fulfill the original intention of peaceful unification. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Personnel from the Fourth Route Army Headquarters' Staff, Military Supplies, and Logistics Departments arrived in the province by car from Shaoguan on the morning of the 23rd. The entire First Division of the First Army has been stationed in the provincial capital. The Second and Third Divisions continue to depart from Shaoguan and are expected to arrive in the province by the 29th. (23rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Li Chonggang, Deputy Division Commander of the 9th Division of the Fourth Route Army under Deng Longguang, and Chen Wen, Chief of Staff of the Guangdong North District Pacification Headquarters, arrived from Hong Kong North on the 18th to pay respects to the central military authorities. After arriving in Nanjing on the 22nd, they learned that Chen Jitang had left Guangdong. They returned to their posts at 5:00 PM and are scheduled to fly back to Guangdong from Shanghai on the morning of the 23rd to await an audience with Yu Hanmou. (23rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government issued two copper seals for the Pacification Commissioner of Guangdong and the Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Route Army, as well as two badges, which have been sent by the Civil Affairs Department to the Military Affairs Commission for distribution. It has also been instructed to submit the date of activation to the government for record-keeping. (23rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Song Ziliang and Others Assume Office, Guangdong Currency Soars</h3>

<h3>Ye Xiasheng Discusses Corruption in Guangdong's Judiciary</h3>
<p>Urgently needs to rectify judicial conduct as a top priority, scheduled to take a boat to Hong Kong and then Guangdong on the 15th to take over the matter</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ye Xiasheng, the newly appointed President of the Guangdong High Court, left for Shanghai on the evening of the 23rd and is scheduled to take a boat to Hong Kong on the 25th and then Guangdong to take over. According to Ye, his trip to Nanjing was originally due to the events in Guangdong and Guangxi, in response to the call from Presidents Sun Ke and Ju Zheng to report to Nanjing. Unexpectedly, the Guangdong affairs were quickly resolved, and he was suddenly appointed to the new position. The southwestern judiciary was brought under the jurisdiction of the military government when Premier Sun Yat-sen went south to preside over the first constitutional protection movement in the sixth year of the Republic (1917). Since then, the southwestern judiciary not only broke away from the Ministry of Justice of the northern government at the time, but also failed to be taken back after the establishment of the National Government. Therefore, the southwestern judiciary has been separated from the central government for 18 years. The judicial situation in Guangdong Province is deeply resented by the people of Guangdong. Although Xie Yingzhou has qualifications, he has been surrounded by villains in recent years, and his behavior is quite improper. The current President of the Guangzhou District Court, Chen Dacai, claims to be a soldier and a member of the Chen faction. Therefore, he is unscrupulous in doing evil, engaging in litigation racketeering, and bribery is rampant, without any scruples, and has long been abandoned by the people of Guangdong. Bribery among judicial officials in Guangdong Province has become a common practice, with superiors influencing subordinates, and many are addicted to opium. The most important reason for the central government's decision to reorganize the Guangdong judiciary this time is precisely this. His trip to Guangdong is to make the rectification of judicial conduct a top priority. President Ju and Minister Wang have repeatedly exhorted this. He should do his best so as not to fail the central government's heavy trust. (23rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Yu Hanmou Issues Statement: Unite and Resist Aggression When National Crisis is Imminent, Central Government Responsible for Reorganizing Guangdong's Finances</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) After flying to Guangdong on the 23rd, Yu Hanmou issued a statement saying, "This time, my brothers and I flew to Nanjing to appeal for peace and to save the country by ending the conflict, which is actually to implement our consistent principle of sincerely uniting to face the national crisis together. In Nanjing, we met with the elder gentlemen and personally received their instructions, and also received Chairman Chiang's personal instructions on all national salvation strategies. We immediately telegraphed the authorities in Guangdong and Guangxi to resolve conflicts and unite the national strength to resist aggression. Then, we received a clear order from the central government, specially appointing us as the Director of Pacification of Guangdong and the Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Route Army. Unable to decline, we decided to telegraph from Dayu to assume office. We believe that we have been a soldier all our lives, and we are indifferent to self-interest. At this time of national crisis, we have long put personal life and safety aside, but we cannot bear to see Guangdong, the source of the revolution, fall into ruin, and the 30 million dear compatriots suffer irreparable damage. In addition, the revolutionary groups that have struggled hard for more than ten years and sacrificed countless martyrs, and the comrades who have shared weal and woe for a long time, are especially the spiritual sustenance and close connections of our hearts. How can we allow them to be destroyed in one day? After careful consideration, we believe that personal interests are small, and the security of the country and the nation is big. Therefore, under the urging of the public, we resolutely accepted the central government's order, telegraphed to return the troops, and clean up the Guangdong situation. We ask ourselves that our nature is frank and straightforward, and we have always been sincere, generous, and tolerant towards people and things. The original generals have worked together for many years and have always been close and without discord, and they all understand the great righteousness and can be trusted. At a time when the country is in crisis and we are sharing the same boat, all the past can be ignored. We must all realize the difficulties of the times, unite sincerely, gather all our strength under the leadership of the central government's unified front against aggression, defend the territory, pacify the region, and seek a way out for the country and the nation, and repay the heavy trust of the party and the country, and also fulfill the earnest expectations of the people of Guangdong, and do our best as revolutionary soldiers. We have always been in awe of the clear warning that soldiers interfering in politics is harmful to the country. Today, we are entrusted with heavy responsibilities, and we feel even more fearful. In order to eliminate the old habits, we deeply wish to set an example, not to ask about politics, and to concentrate on training the military for national use. In the military aspect, we should first restore the original state before June 1, so that the people of Guangdong can quickly move towards stability. At this time of national poverty, economic depression, and public and private difficulties, we should be far-sighted and consider the entire national strength and the lives of all the people as prerequisites. We have always hoped to recruit fewer soldiers, so that we can reduce our personal sin by one point, which is to reduce the burden on the people by one point and cultivate the vitality of the locality by one point. Therefore, we strongly advocate that all financial affairs of the province be placed under the responsibility of the central government for reorganization, in order to conform to the original intention of complete unification and implement the original intention. All people in Guangdong should clearly understand the central government's painstaking efforts to safeguard the entire Guangdong this time and its determination to prioritize the local people. They should not harbor selfish views and arbitrarily divide the territory. The central government will also be able to coordinate and take care of the overall national financial plan. We can only help with the reorganization with a spirit of consistent trust and cooperation between the top and the bottom, so as to achieve its effectiveness as soon as possible, to relieve the people's difficulties and to strengthen national defense. This is the only way out for the people of Guangdong to turn danger into safety and a foolproof strategy. The revolutionary enthusiasm of our Guangdong compatriots has long been well-known at home and abroad. At this critical moment of life and death, we believe that we can understand the international environment and unite to assist the government to strive for excellence, jointly protect the country, and maintain the long-standing reputation of the source of the revolution. We have always loved the four words "practicality and hard work" the most, and we often use them to encourage ourselves and respectfully encourage our 30 million fathers, elders, brothers, sisters, and sisters in the entire Guangdong province to create a new Guangdong situation with a deeper determination."

<h3>On the Spanish Upheaval</h3>
<p>— Heng</p>
<p>In recent days, Spain has been in turmoil due to a military coup, and the future trends deserve close attention. Since the overthrow of the military government and the establishment of a republic in April 1931 through a referendum, the political situation in the country has been turbulent and unsettled. Initially, the center-left factions were dominant, drafting a constitution that separated politics and religion and implementing plans for land reform and universal education. For a time, it seemed to be quite promising, but the right-wing forces were still very active in reality. Therefore, few landowners had their land divided, and most of the property of the Catholic Church remained intact. In the general election of December 1933, the right-wing suddenly won, and all the reform plans since the 1931 revolution were shelved. Even the will and rights of the people were suspended for a long time, thus arousing the dissatisfaction of the masses. Revolts and labor strikes were almost daily occurrences. In this year's general election in February, the left-wing parties, due to the establishment of a People's Front, won another major victory. As a result, the right-wing parties in Congress were unable to do anything. At this point, it was expected that the reactionary military would plot a restoration, causing a tragic war.</p>
<p>It is still difficult to predict whether the current Spanish government has the ability to quell the military rebellion. However, it can be said that the current Spanish incident is a touchstone for the strength of the left and right factions in Spain, and its political form will therefore undergo changes. We know that the left-wing parties in the current Congress occupy a considerable advantage, but in terms of political power, the one who holds the balance is actually the left-wing Republican Party of the center-left faction. This party is essentially a middle-class political party. In order to unite the extreme-left Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and the anarchist-syndicalist factions to maintain its own advantage, it has to show a left-leaning color in its policies, such as amnesty for political prisoners arrested in the October 1934 uprising, and temporary non-payment of rent by tenant farmers before the large estates are distributed. All these measures are to cater to the demands of the extreme-left factions, but since the left-wing Republican Party is a middle-class political party, it has its own unique position of the middle class. Therefore, although the extreme-left factions have listed items such as nationalization of land banks and business subsidies in the People's Front program, they have not yet been implemented. If the extreme-left factions push too hard, they may even join hands with the right-wing, which is also possible. In the eyes of the extreme-left factions, the left-wing Republican Party government is only a transitional rule.</p>
<p>From the above, it can be seen that after this incident in Spain, no matter who wins, the political status of the middle class will inevitably become weaker day by day, and the transformation of its current political form should also be seen in the results of the current turmoil.</p>
<h3>China-Japan Detective Conflict Case, Tianjin Municipal Government Accepts Japanese Demands, Resolved Satisfactorily, We Publish the Facts, The Whole Case Is Transferred to the Judiciary for Legal Punishment</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) At about 12:30 PM on the 22nd, a bloody tragedy occurred due to a misunderstanding between a small number of Chinese and Japanese detectives at the southern intersection of Dajing Road outside the Tianjin Municipal Government. Fortunately, the authorities on both sides were sincere and dealt with it quickly. It was satisfactorily resolved on the morning of the 23rd. According to the facts published by the Municipal Government, the squadron leader of the Security 9th Squadron, Zou Fengling, who was responsible for guarding the Municipal Government, went to the Japanese Concession Public Bureau Special Service Team in plain clothes on the evening of the 21st to inspect pedestrians. Zou's appearance was suspicious. They searched his body and found no contraband. They took him to the Japanese police station for questioning. Zou claimed to be a small wood merchant living outside a certain location outside the new station tunnel. On the morning of the 22nd, the police station sent two special agents by car to escort Zou to the Public Security Bureau for consultation and sent a detective to Hebei to investigate his address. At this time, the security team of the Municipal Bureau saw that Zou had not returned overnight and was deeply surprised. Just as the car escorting Zou arrived at the north end of the Jingang Bridge outside the Municipal Government, Zou, with his hands cuffed in the car, shouted loudly "kidnapping", "bandits", and "save me". Because the place was close to the Municipal Government, the guards in front did not know what was going on. When they went up to stop him, they saw that the squad leader was being held by several burly men with shackles, and the car had no official application label. Thinking they were bandits, they caused a misunderstanding. The Japanese special agent Zhang Delu in the car was shot and killed. The captain of the jurisdiction and the Municipal Government team rushed to the scene to suppress the situation one after another. The Japanese Police Chief Kazui and others also rushed to the scene with many detectives. The Public Security Bureau Chief Cheng Xixian and others also arrived to take care of the situation. Kazui also went to the Municipal Government to meet Zhang Zizhong and others. At the same time, Prosecutor Tu of the local court also arrived at the scene with the president of the Datong Hospital in the Japanese Concession to complete the examination. The Japanese police station transported Zhang's body back by car. The Municipal Government and the Japanese Consul General's Office and the senior officials of the Japanese police station negotiated fairly and sincerely. By noon on the 23rd, it was satisfactorily resolved. It is said that the solutions are to punish the perpetrators and comfort the victims in accordance with the law. It is also said that the authorities on both sides met with each other at 4:00 PM on the 23rd, and the turmoil was over. (23rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Zou Fengling was handed over to the Japanese side by the Public Security Bureau for interrogation because Zou was a criminal under investigation by the station. He was sent back to the Public Security Bureau on the evening of the 23rd and will be sent to the court with Squad Leader Wu and a guard who fired the shots within days for legal treatment by the judicial authorities. Nishida said that there was no deep meaning in this matter. Mayor Zhang also sincerely accepted the Japanese demands, so he did not want to expand it and ended it. The military did not interfere in this matter because it was not its responsibility. Ma Yanchong also said that when the incident occurred, the Municipal Government was closing down, and the leaders should not have been vague, which would lead people to misunderstand the facts. The Municipal Government will be fair in punishing the criminals. The Japanese demands are all reasonable and must be accepted. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At noon on the 22nd, a tragedy occurred in front of the Tianjin Municipal Government.

At 10:00 AM on the 23rd, Zhang Zizhong sent Municipal Secretary Ma Yanchong, Councilor Nan Sheng, and Public Security Bureau Chief Cheng Xixian to visit Japanese Deputy Consul Nishida and Police Chief Kazui at the Japanese Consulate General to talk sincerely. The Japanese side believed that there was no background to the occurrence of this case and requested (1) the mayor to apologize formally, (2) severely punish the shooters and the involved company commander, (3) give generous compensation to the deceased special agent and the injured special agent's driver, and (4) ensure that there will be no such incidents in the future. Ma and others said they fully accepted it. At 3:00 PM, Nishida visited Zhang Zizhong at the Municipal Government for final negotiations. Zhang also agreed to accept the request. Nishida said that the items raised orally had no basis, and he would send a written document as a supplement. After the Municipal Government received and replied to it, the procedures were completed and the matter was resolved. At 4:00 PM in the afternoon, Zhang Zizhong and Lu Nansheng went to the residence of Japanese Consul General Tajiri in the British Concession to apologize in person. Before the misunderstanding occurred, the staff of the Third Section of the Municipal Government had been to the Japanese police station to inquire whether Zou Fengling had been arrested. When the tragedy suddenly occurred, they were detained. They were released on the 23rd. (23rd Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Chengdu is Not a Treaty Port and Should Not Have a Consulate According to the Treaty</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The establishment of consulates by various countries in our country is limited to treaty ports. Chengdu is not a commercial port and should not have a consulate according to the treaty. Previously, when Britain, Germany, and other countries found it convenient to negotiate, the Governor-General was allowed to send personnel to Chengdu temporarily under the name of consuls stationed in Chongqing, which set a bad precedent. Later, the personnel stationed in Chengdu by Britain and Germany were successively withdrawn. Only France still sends personnel with representative status to continue to be stationed in Chengdu. Over time, many people mistakenly regarded the French consul stationed in Chengdu as legitimate. In order to avoid misunderstandings from all sides, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently negotiated with the French Embassy, requesting that the title of consul used by the personnel be revoked to prevent other countries from following suit. The French Embassy has now agreed to instruct the personnel to change the title accordingly. (Special dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The establishment of consulates by various countries in our country has always been limited to treaty ports. Chengdu is not a commercial port and should not have a consulate. During the late Qing Dynasty, during the Guangxu era, the consuls of Britain and Germany stationed in Chongqing, speaking of encountering things to negotiate with the Governor-General, there was the act of sending personnel stationed in Chengdu under the name of consuls stationed in Chongqing. Later, the personnel stationed in Chengdu by Britain and Germany were successively withdrawn. France still sends representatives to continue to be stationed in Chengdu. Many people mistakenly regarded them as French consuls stationed in Chengdu. In order to avoid misunderstandings from all sides, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently negotiated with the French Embassy, requesting that the title of consul used by the personnel be revoked.

<h3>Preliminary Work Objectives of the National Economic Construction General Association; Developing Agricultural, Industrial, and Sideline Occupations; Promoting Thrift Movement</h3>

<h3>Various Businesses Request Postponement of Income Tax; Remarks by Gao Bingfang; All Concerns of Various Businesses Have Been Seen; Those Earning More Than 5% Profit Should No Longer Be Reluctant</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Various chambers of commerce have agreed in Shanghai to request the government to postpone income tax due to the decline of industry and commerce and the decline of all industries. Central News Agency reporters specially visited Gao Bingfang, Director of the Central Direct Tax Preparation Office of the Ministry of Finance, to inquire about his opinions. According to him, the various chambers of commerce have noted the poverty of the national economy and the sluggishness of industrial and commercial operations, and their conclusion to request a postponement of income tax is not without misunderstandings. The government has taken into account various points of concern to the various chambers of commerce in this income tax implementation and has taken steps to provide relief. Therefore, the provisional regulations on income tax clearly stipulate that all companies, shops, firms, factories, or individuals with capital of more than 2,000 yuan will be taxed only if their net profit after all expenses is more than 5% per year. Those with capital of less than 2,000 yuan are exempt from tax, and those with capital of more than 2,000 yuan but with a net profit of less than 5% per year are also naturally exempt from tax. This restriction on the starting point of taxation and the light taxation rate are intended to take into account the actual situation of the current social economy and the people's livelihood. Gao also said that income tax is equivalent to a congratulatory card from the store to my wealth. The government's implementation of income tax is hoping that every merchant can make money. Merchants who are willing to make money should not oppose the imposition of income tax. If they oppose the imposition of income tax because they have no wealth to make and their business can only barely maintain the status quo and there is no income to speak of, it is a great misunderstanding, because the government will not tax the income of those who cannot make money and whose income does not meet the legal conditions. Gao concluded by saying that a sound citizen who operates a business with a capital of more than 2,000 yuan and earns a net profit of more than 5% per year should not be reluctant to fulfill his minor obligations to the government. Moreover, the central government's purpose in implementing income tax this time is to reform the central tax system, equalize the burden on the people, and prepare for the finances of the extraordinary period. It is hoped that the business community will sincerely support it to see it through. (Central News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Chen Zhaoying is scheduled to leave Nanjing for Shanghai at 11:00 PM on the 23rd, stay in Shanghai for three to two days, and return to Fujian. According to Chen's interview with reporters, there are few cases of corruption among officials above the county level in Fujian and Zhejiang provinces.

<h3>New Life Movement General Association Bans Extra Tips at Tea Houses</h3>

The main points of the measures are that no extra tips should be charged to guests in addition to the regular bill. If a tea house asks for extra tips, the guest should refuse. When a guest gives extra tips, the tea house should refuse. Otherwise, if it is found out, both parties will be punished. (Central News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<h3>Rebel Army Launches Three-Pronged General Offensive; Decisive Battle Near Madrid in Spain; Cannon Fire Rumbles and Aircraft Carry Out Bombing; Government Forces Make Progress in Mixed Battles in Various Provinces</h3>
<p>(London) It is heard that the Spanish government forces and the rebel army are currently engaged in fierce fighting outside Madrid. At dawn today, 5,000 militiamen rushed from Madrid to Guadalajara to stop the rebel army from advancing. Stores in Madrid are completely closed, and there are no pedestrians on the streets. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) Although the Spanish government still claims to be defeating the rebel army, the fate of Madrid is still uncertain. It is heard that the rebel army is approaching the capital on three fronts. The first route is led by General Mola and is 36 miles from Madrid, and will soon come into contact with the government forces in the Boitaco highlands. Another route led by Mola has already started fighting in Villalba, and the third route will also press on towards Madrid. Government forces are currently preparing to meet them. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>France, Andaye The Spanish rebel army's three-pronged advance will come into contact with the government forces at the border between the provinces of Navarre and Guipúzcoa. The area is mountainous, rugged and difficult to traverse, and is very suitable for ambushes. There have been reports of cannon fire, and it appears the two sides have already engaged in a lull. However, the exact situation of the two armies is unknown. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Porras The rebel headquarters here announced today that the revolutionary army has decided to attack Madrid on Friday, at which time the outcome can be determined. The revolutionary army currently has 50,000 men and is only 35 miles from Madrid. Among them, 30,000 men are from General Franco's southern army, 10,000 men are from General Mola's northern army, and 7,500 men are imperial volunteer troops. They are currently surrounding Madrid on separate routes. Another team of fascist militia has reached 60 miles outside the capital today after engaging government-recruited miners. General Mola's forces, due to repeated military victories in the north, are preparing to step up their offensive on Madrid. Another rebel team is advancing from San Sebastian towards Irun, intending to link up with the rebel army advancing east along the French border. However, the rebel army advancing east has been unable to advance because bridges have been destroyed along the way. The two armies are aiming for northern Catalonia as their destination. There is also a third army composed of royalists, which is also advancing on Madrid. Its vanguard has already approached Madrid. General Mola originally planned to attack Madrid on Wednesday, but postponed it to await reinforcements. The rebel army in the San Sebastian area has also failed to completely control the area, which is another reason for the rebel army's postponement of the general offensive. (National News dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<h3>Barcelona Bloodbath: Days of Hand-to-Hand Combat Leave Corpses Strewn Across the Field</h3>
<p>Peppigran: According to a Reuters correspondent in Barcelona, the city has endured days of horrific hand-to-hand combat, day and night. Armed civilians assisted government troops in suppressing the rebels. The sounds of machine guns and cannons were constant. Sunday was one of the worst days, with at least 300 people dying in the streets by dusk. After the rebels were suppressed, anarchists and communists formed gangs, looting, burning churches and monasteries, and massacring priests.

<p>琶塞龍納: The President of the Catalan Autonomous Provincial Government, 岡巴尼斯, has just ordered that the province's working class should immediately be formed into a militia to fight the fascist rebels, and has appointed 法拉斯 as the commander-in-chief of the labor militia. Last Sunday, a portion of the rebels occupied the local telephone bureau and several barracks. 法拉斯 himself led the militia to repel the rebels. In addition, 岡巴尼斯 also ordered representatives from each party belonging to the People's Front to form a committee to assist 法拉斯. This committee has now been established and has decided on the following: (1) to form patrol teams to execute the provincial government's orders; (2) every day after midnight, from 1:00 AM to 5:00 AM, no one is allowed to travel on the streets except for members of parties belonging to the People's Front. At this point, the provincial government is able to control the overall situation in Catalonia. Order in the city has been fully restored. All automobiles in the city have been requisitioned and are being driven by the police and the People's Front militia to patrol various locations and maintain security. Several airplanes have departed from here, heading to the southern Andalusian province, intending to bomb the rebels there. Air Force Colonel 桑蒂諾 was recently dispatched to lead a team to the city of Zaragoza, where they dropped bombs. A telegram has just arrived reporting to President 岡巴尼斯 that a total of seventy bombs were dropped, causing significant damage to the rebel barracks.

Furthermore, many insurgents now have whimsical ideas, hiding in various houses, opening fire from windows, and shooting at the militias in order to provoke them to retaliate, thereby wasting government bullets. The various organizations belonging to the People's Front have now ordered the militias not to retaliate against the insurgents unless they are sure of hitting them, in order to conserve bullets.

<h3>Spanish Prime Minister Announces Status of Suppression; Rebel Generals Dismissed</h3>

Rebel leader General フランコ falsely imagines that the navy will turn against the government and should abandon this thought. As for フランコ himself, he is still in Melilla, Morocco. Finance Minister ラ摩斯 also stated that the government's current task is not only to suppress the rebels but also to provide food to the military and civilians. A troop of soldiers has just transported rice to the capital from the city of Valencia. He then detailed the government's combat plan, stating that government forces have advanced in three routes to retake the city of Albacete.

Several shells exploded near the ship, and the Widgeon fired a warning shot, after which the aircraft disappeared. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<h3>The U.S. to Station Ships in the Atlantic and Mediterranean, But No Landing of Marines Under the Guise of Protecting Nationals</h3>
<p>(Washington) Although the United States recently announced its policy of concentrating its fleet in the Pacific, Secretary of State Hull predicted today that the United States may restore its pre-1928 policy, citing the instability in Europe as a reason, and station a squadron of warships in the Mediterranean and the eastern Atlantic. Hull said that although this issue has not been actively considered, the government is not ignoring the possibility of such a move. (国民電, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Washington) When Secretary of State Hull met with reporters today, he mentioned that due to the instability in Europe, the US government may be forced to redeploy a naval squadron to European waters. Hull stated that although consideration of this issue has not made substantial progress, the US government will not ignore the problems caused by the absence of warships stationed in Europe. Since the last two cruisers of the US European Fleet were withdrawn in 1929, no US warships have been stationed in European waters. Hull also mentioned that the dispatch of US warships to Spain was due to the increasingly serious revolutionary situation in that country. The warships were sent purely as a precaution, and this action was reported to President Luo in detail. When asked if US Marines would be deployed to protect the lives of American citizens in Spain, Hull replied that neither the USS Oklahoma nor the USS Sinex, which were ordered to sail to Spain yesterday, were carrying Marines. According to reports, the USS Oklahoma is a training ship and is currently docked in Cherbourg, France, and will soon sail to Spain. The new heavy cruiser USS Quincy is en route to Europe and is expected to arrive in Gibraltar on Friday. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Washington) Windelin, the third secretary of the US Embassy in Spain, notified the State Department today that street fighting had broken out in the 爪泰拉馬 region, and an American woman was injured. Therefore, the State Department believes that the situation in Spain has become even more critical and is preparing to evacuate American citizens even before the US warships arrive in Spain. The first step is to notify the American shipping company to reroute the USS Uxide, which is scheduled to arrive in Marseille on Thursday, to Barcelona to evacuate American citizens who wish to leave Spain for refuge. This morning, the President of the Catalan Autonomous Government declared to the American Consul in Barcelona that he could not guarantee the safety of foreigners in the city. Secretary Windelin believes that if the situation in the Spanish capital does not change, there will be no problems with the embassy. However, armed youths have been requisitioning automobiles in the city, and government authorities have no time to address the grievances of foreigners. (国民電, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) The State Department has just received a report from the US Embassy in Spain stating that "criminals in the Spanish capital may break into private residences under the pretext of searching for rebels, inspecting them one by one, thereby endangering the lives of residents."

<h3>Anglo-Egyptian Military Treaty Formally Signed Today</h3>

<h3>Britain, France, and Belgium Meet in London to Prepare for a Five-Nation Conference; A New Western European Pact to Replace the Locarno Treaty; Date Tentatively Set for September, Attitudes of Italy and Germany Undecided</h3>
<p>(London) The meeting of Britain, France, and Belgium officially opened at 10:30 this morning. Attending were British representatives Prime Minister Baldwin, Foreign Secretary Eden, and Lord Privy Seal Halifax; French representative Foreign Minister Daladier; and Belgian representatives Prime Minister Janson and Foreign Minister Spaak. French Prime Minister Blum departed from the Paris airfield at 10:00 this morning and arrived during the lunch break. Today's meeting is merely a formality, as the three countries have already reached an understanding. It is reported that the French originally favored turning the temporary defense measures agreed upon by Britain, France, and Belgium into a permanent agreement, pending Germany's expression of remorse for its entry into the Rhineland. However, they have recently changed their position and agreed with the British view that the above-mentioned actions may cause other countries to misunderstand it as a hostile alliance. For this reason, the main task of today's meeting is to draft a communiqué as preparation for convening a conference of all signatories of the Locarno Treaty, namely Britain, France, Belgium, Germany, and Italy. The five-nation conference may be held in September. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) The Anglo-Franco-Belgian conference was held for the first time this morning at 10 Downing Street, the Prime Minister's residence, lasting two hours. It is reported that "good progress has been made." It is generally believed that the representatives of the three countries have reached a compromise in principle. At the opening of the meeting, Prime Minister Baldwin first delivered a speech, welcoming the French and Belgian delegations, and stating that this discussion is of a preliminary nature. Afterwards, a plenary conference of the five signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty will be convened so that Italy and Germany can participate. The date of the five-nation conference was then discussed. The French delegation advocated holding it in August, while the British delegation advocated holding it in October, so as not to conflict with the regular session of the League of Nations General Assembly in September. The purpose of the five-nation conference is to establish a new Western European security pact to replace the Locarno Treaty, and because of Germany's participation, it can be seen what kind of aspirations the country has for international cooperation, and the contents of the understanding recently reached between Germany and Italy can also be measured in the five-nation conference. At this point, the meeting was adjourned until 3:30 PM. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) The Anglo-Franco-Belgian talks are now scheduled to begin tomorrow morning. French Foreign Minister Daladier led his entourage and arrived here at 7:00 PM, and stayed at a hotel in the West End. The Belgian delegation is scheduled to arrive here tomorrow morning, while French Prime Minister Léon Blum will not be able to arrive until noon tomorrow. According to political figures, there are two main difficulties in the three-nation talks: one is the Rhineland issue, and the other is the future European conference. Regarding the first point, Germany is actively constructing fortifications in the Rhineland area, and France is concerned that these fortifications will be completed soon. Therefore, France advocates that Germany should temporarily suspend work to show a spirit of compromise, otherwise it is unwilling to negotiate with it. As for Britain, it believes that since neither Britain nor France intends to use force, it is better to negotiate openly and honestly with Germany. Regarding the second point, France is deeply afraid that the European conference may attempt to revise the peace treaties, causing the Little Entente and the Balkan Entente to feel uneasy, so it opposes the idea. As for Belgium, its Foreign Minister Spaak recently declared that Belgium's main concern is its own security and is unwilling to assume other burdens. Therefore, political figures believe that Belgium will also disagree with the plan for the European conference. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Rome) After the representatives of Britain, France, and Belgium began their meeting in London today, political figures here believe that this is an expression of hostility towards Italy by those countries, and that Italy should still refuse to participate in various European issues. The newspapers state that Italian diplomacy is not passive, as can be seen from the agreement recently reached between Germany and Austria. The 共中使者報載 claims that "If Italy wants to participate in European issues, the necessary condition lies in the removal of the remnants of the sanctions policy." (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Austria Grants Amnesty, 10,000 Regain Freedom</h3>
<p>(Vienna) President Miklas recently issued an amnesty order, pardoning approximately 10,000 political prisoners. Those who participated in the Socialist Party uprising in February 1934 and the Nazi Party riots in July of the same year and were sentenced to less than ten years of imprisonment have been pardoned, but 224 people with more serious circumstances (including eleven members of the Socialist Party) have not been pardoned. Former Ambassador to Italy, 林德倫, is also among them, which is contrary to general expectations. In addition, Germany and Austria had previously banned the entry of certain newspapers. Now, except for the German Nazi Party's organ "People's Observer" newspaper, the Party Army's organ "Attack" newspaper, and the Austrian government's organ "Federal Mail" newspaper, the ban on other newspapers has been lifted. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Nazi Party's organ, the People's Observer, recently published a message stating that the Austrian Nazi Party cadres yesterday issued an order to all party members to strictly abide by the German-Austrian agreement. Austrian figures here have expressed disagreement with what the newspaper reported, stating that since the establishment of the German-Austrian agreement, the Austrian Nazi Party has ceased to exist. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3>British and Italian Forces in Africa Withdraw</h3>
<p>Cairo: The British military authorities in Egypt, due to Italy's increased deployment of defensive troops in its Libyan territory, had previously built barracks, increased garrison strength, and arranged defenses in the city of Marsa Matruh, near the Libyan border, in November of last year. Now that the Italian-Ethiopian war has ended and some of the Italian troops stationed in Libya have returned to their country, the situation has eased considerably compared to the past. Therefore, a portion of the British troops stationed in the Marsa Matruh military camp, 2,000 men, have recently returned here. According to semi-official sources, another 2,000 British soldiers will be withdrawn in early October and redeployed to Cairo and other locations. (Havas, 22nd)</p>

<h3>Where is the Hirota Cabinet Going? (5)</h3>
<p>— Jia He</p>
<p>If we regard Koki Hirota's fall from grace and the temporary withdrawal of the military's aggressive stance as a temporary ebb of rapid fascism, then it would seem that the power of political parties and the power of true democracy would grow proportionally. However, the reality is not so. Today's Japanese political parties, due to their own corruption and long-standing scandals of collusion with the zaibatsu (financial cliques), find it difficult to restore their own reputation. The established power of the military cannot be manipulated by unpopular political party leaders. Moreover, the elder statesmen and senior officials above the political parties do not have the courage to trust the political parties. Even the zaibatsu, after the "February 26th Incident," on the one hand, adopted deceptive tactics to eliminate public resentment, and on the other hand, abandoned their past policy of utilizing political parties and directly established relationships with military leaders. They each used the power of money to win over the military forces that could fight for their own interests, hoping to recoup significant returns in the future. Therefore, the political parties, having lost the vigorous support of the zaibatsu, speak of revitalization, but in fact, their heart is weakening day by day. Although, in the parliament, political parties still serve as a tool for passing bills, this is merely a dying ember's reflection. Currently, they are like a candle in the wind; as soon as the wind rises, even the bean-sized light will disappear. Moreover, outside of them, there are the bureaucratic forces that constantly deprive them of their interests. Hirota, in such an environment, plays the role of a shrewd and artful charmer. For the sake of the "Constitutional Politics" signboard, he woos the political parties to increase his power against the military; to restrain the political parties, he sometimes feigns the authority of the military. He veers with the wind, without fixed opinions. His reason for doing so is due to objective factors! Japanese capitalism, which has already entered the stage of oligarchical zaibatsu control over various industrial departments, has long rendered any political party that truly fights for democracy almost extinct. The current political parties, whether it is the Minseitō (Democratic Constitutional Party), the Seiyūkai (Association of Friends of Constitutional Government), the Shōwakai (Showa Society), or the Kokumin Dōmei (National League), although there are subtle differences in their political programs, all wear the mask of constitutionalism and mercilessly oppress the proletariat. Because the power of the proletariat is not yet enough to fluster the ruling class, they also utilize the parliamentary politics that are nominally run by political parties as a mechanism for dividing interests among themselves, as a regulator to restrain the frantic expansion of the military, and as a tool for formulating various laws and regulations to legally bind workers and peasants. If one day, the ruling class of Japan proves that this mechanism, this regulator, this tool, has lost its function, they will seize the ghost of Shirō Nonaka and others, in other words: they will adopt a rapid fascist path.</p>
<p>The Hirota cabinet is also like a scale, placing the forces of the political parties, the military, and the bureaucracy on it, and using specially made weights to measure them. During the extraordinary session of the Diet, he mobilized the political parties and admonished the military, while at the same time, he flattered the military and elevated their power, as evidenced by the May 18th ordinances of appointing active-duty lieutenant generals and major generals as military ministers and deciding officials. Some people believe, based on the historical development of this official system, that it is an indicator of the rise and fall of the power of political parties and the military, which is a fully justified reason. However, to conclude from this that the Hirota cabinet has lost its transitional nature and is a manifestation of yielding to the military would be too arbitrary. We know that the reform of the military system began in the second year of the Taisho era. At that time, liberalism was prevalent, and the Yamamoto cabinet, in view of the previous incident where the Terauchi cabinet was "poisoned" by Minister of the Army Uehara, disregarded the opposition of General Yoshimichi Hasegawa and the resignation of Minister of the Army Kigoshi, and expanded the qualifications of the Minister of the Army to include reservists. However, from the date of the promulgation of the official system to the establishment of the Hirota cabinet, there was no instance of a reserve lieutenant general or major general serving as Minister of the Army, but instead, the army interior was reduced to a tripartite political system – that is, the bad example of the heads of the three bureaus deciding personnel matters. Now, Hirota is reversing what the Yamamoto cabinet did, and he also has his reasons: first, the facts are such; second, it is better to let the Minister of the Army control the actual power than to let the three bureau chiefs decide personnel matters; third, Araki, Masaki, and others have already been incorporated into the reserve and will no longer be able to wield military power. From this perspective, Hirota's actions are definitely not without significance. Moreover, a mere ordinance regarding the active-duty military officer system is not enough to prove that the Hirota cabinet has lost its transitional nature.</p>

<h3>U.S. Republican Presidential Candidate's Speech</h3>
<p>Advocates Liberalism, Promotes Peace with Justice.</p>
<p>Topeka, Kansas. Republican presidential candidate Landon stood before the Kansas State Capitol today and delivered a speech to thousands of supporters, expressing his acceptance of the party's nomination. This is the first sound of the Republican Party's participation in the presidential election campaign. In his speech, Landon promised to fully liberate the spirit of innovation and freedom in American enterprises so that the scope of commerce and professions can be expanded. He also vehemently criticized the current government's "New Deal" as inappropriate, saying that the slow recovery of prosperity is due to this. He also said that the country must avoid the influence of arbitrary and unstable monetary policies. The Republican Party advocates for thrift in government spending, but those in need must be assisted. He also proposed giving cash benefits to farmers to protect them from the effects of price fluctuations and to maintain their standard of living. As for diplomacy, it will be based on justice and will promote peace at all times. Furthermore, he will absolutely not participate in any plans that would involve the country in irrelevant wars or build false peace on military blocs. Finally, he guaranteed the restoration and maintenance of a free competition system. (Reuters telegram, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Pan-American Peace Conference</h3>
<p>Many Issues to be Discussed</p>
<p>(Washington) All countries in North and South America, except Canada, have been invited to participate in the Pan-American Peace Conference initiated by President Roosevelt. It is learned today that the conference will be lengthy. The Associated Press obtained the final draft of the conference agenda, which includes many issues, such as forming a "League of American Nations" through peaceful means, as well as other legal and economic issues. According to President Roosevelt's initial intention, there were not so many issues. Diplomats from Latin America feared that the Eighth Pan-American Conference, to be held in Peru's capital in 1938, would be greatly affected. The Associated Press learned that the agenda was expanded because diplomatic circles believed that some countries might express dissatisfaction if their proposals were not included in the agenda.

<h3>Non-Stop Flight of Ten Thousand Li from Moscow to Khabarovsk Completed. A Feat by Soviet Russian Aviators.</h3>
<p>(Moscow) According to a report from the Central Aviation Department of the People's Heavy Industry Committee, the ANT-25 aircraft, previously ordered by the department to make a 10,000-kilometer non-stop flight from Moscow to Chita, has now gloriously completed its mission.

<p>Educational Broadcasting Special Issue</p>
<h3>Secondary School Education (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Liao Shi-chieh, Professor, Kwong Hua University, Shanghai</p>
<p>The purpose of secondary school education, like the educational goals of a nation, shifts with the times. The educational goals set during the late Qing dynasty emphasized loyalty to the emperor, honoring Confucius, valuing public service, practicality, and martial spirit. By the late Guangxu and early Xuantong years, there was a gradual shift towards pragmatism, adopting a system of dividing subjects into arts and sciences. During the early years of the Republic, the educational goal was "to perfect morality through aesthetics." By the sixth year of the Republic, vocational education was emphasized. After the eighth year of the Republic, secondary schools adopted an elective system, striving to adapt to individual aptitudes. The new school system to be implemented in the eleventh year of the Republic stipulated six principles (these principles were revised by the First National Education Conference): (1) Based on the actual conditions of the country, (2) Adapting to the needs of the people's livelihood, (3) Increasing educational efficiency, (4) Promoting the development of individuality, (5) Making education easier to popularize, (6) Allowing for local flexibility. Since the National Revolutionary Army pacified the country and established the National Government, all facilities have taken on a new look, giving rise to the Three Principles of the People education. In April of the eighteenth year, the National Government promulgated an educational purpose: "The education of the Republic of China is based on the Three Principles of the People, with the purpose of enriching the people's lives, supporting the survival of society, developing the national economy, and continuing the life of the nation, striving for national independence, universal civil rights, and the development of the people's livelihood, in order to promote world harmony." The objectives of secondary school education were specifically stated in the General Outline of Secondary School Regulations promulgated by the Ministry in the twenty-second year: (1) Forging strong physiques, (2) Cultivating civic morality, (3) Nurturing national culture, (4) Enriching life skills and knowledge, (5) Cultivating a scientific foundation, (6) Forming labor habits, (7) Inspiring artistic interests. Since the Mukden Incident, the national crisis has been more serious than ever before, and the call for national defense education, production education, and education for extraordinary times has permeated the country. The recently released draft constitution of the Republic of China stipulates that the purpose of education is to promote the national spirit, cultivate national morality, train self-government capabilities, and enhance production knowledge and skills, in order to create healthy citizens. If we can grasp these four key points in the future and implement them effectively, we will surely achieve clear results and achieve the goal of saving the nation.</p>
<p>The curriculum of secondary schools is an interpretation of "national experience," indicating that many things must be experienced in childhood. Therefore, the curriculum of an era represents the needs of that era. The curriculum of secondary schools in our country has changed several times. The secondary school curriculum during the Guangxu era of the late Qing dynasty was divided into twelve subjects: (1) Self-cultivation, (2) Reading and lecturing on the classics, (3) Chinese literature, (4) Foreign languages, (5) History, (6) Geography, (7) Mathematics, (8) Natural history, (9) Physics and chemistry, (10) Law and finance, (11) Drawing, (12) Physical education. There were thirty-six hours per week. During the Xuantong era, secondary schools had a system of dividing subjects into arts and sciences. In the early years of the Republic, secondary schools abolished the reading of classics and added art subjects. The weekly teaching time was also reduced to thirty-four hours. In the eighth year, the Ministry of Education approved secondary schools to "consider local conditions and appropriately increase or decrease subjects and time." Schools adopted the elective system based on this document. After the implementation of the new system, the National Education Federation drafted a new curriculum standard outline. In the autumn of the eighteenth year, the Ministry of Education promulgated interim standards for primary and secondary school curricula, with significant changes in the course of study. In November of the twenty-first year, the Ministry of Education promulgated new standards for senior and junior high school curricula, with the following changes: (1) Party ideology teaching materials were incorporated into civics, history, geography, and other subjects, without setting up separate courses; (2) Elective subjects and the credit system were abolished; (3) The division of senior and junior high school students into arts and sciences was abolished; (4) Teaching hours were increased. After the promulgation of the new standards, schools in various places felt that the workload was too heavy, leaving no time for extracurricular activities. Therefore, the curriculum standards were revised by the Ministry of Education again in February of this year, with several key points:</p>
<p>(1) Emphasizing the development of students' ability to study independently and reducing their course burden. In recent years, people in society have commented that the secondary school curriculum emphasizes textbook knowledge, with too many total hours, too much teaching material, and a lack of independent study and interest, which may even hinder their physical and mental development. This revision of the subject and time schedule by the Ministry of Education first focuses on reducing the burden on students' courses and developing their ability to study independently. The total number of teaching hours per week before junior high school is 34-35 hours, now reduced to 31 hours; before senior high school is 31-34 hours, now changed to about 29 hours. The content of teaching materials for subjects with reduced hours is also reduced accordingly.</p>
<p>(2) Emphasizing national consciousness. After the Ministry of Education announced the revised subject and hour schedule for junior and senior high school mathematics, the second step was to revise and enrich the curriculum standards for junior and senior high school subjects, adding teaching materials on the national spirit to civics, Chinese language, history, and geography.</p>
<p>(3) Considering the individuality of students. The old senior high school subject and hour schedule lacked flexibility and did not fully consider the individuality of students. In this revision, the Ministry of Education stipulates that from the second academic year of senior high school, students can be divided into Group A and Group B. Students with an aptitude for natural sciences should study more mathematics; students with an aptitude for arts, history, and social sciences should study less mathematics and more Chinese, logic, and English to replace it.</p>
<p>(4) Taking into account students who do not go on to higher education. Senior high school is designed for students who go on to higher education, but in reality, many students do not go on to higher education. Under the current school system, these students should enter secondary vocational schools as the proper path. However, in fact, students' choice of schools is often not entirely rational, and the number of vocational schools is still insufficient. Therefore, the Ministry of Education stipulates in the revised senior high school subject and hour schedule that senior high schools may, depending on local conditions, offer simple vocational subjects (such as commerce, accounting, bookkeeping, statistics, applied writing, typing, agronomy, horticulture, cooperative societies, etc.) as elective subjects in the final academic year, so that those who cannot go on to higher education can still prepare for employment. In addition, the Ministry of Education is currently working on compiling editing outlines for each subject to facilitate teaching.</p>
<p>Teaching in secondary schools. The purpose of teaching is to enable students to learn. To enable students to learn, we must encourage students, guide students, and put students in a learning environment. Teachers and students often have many misunderstandings about learning:</p>
<p>First, misunderstanding learning materials as the results of learning. The most common misunderstanding is to focus on memorizing facts, repeating teaching materials, and doing prescribed exercises. These are not real learning. Everyone has forgotten the real results. Everyone pursues false learning, resulting in people who only know how to study from books and have no effect on dealing with people and things. This kind of education can only be called paper education or bookworm education.</p>
<p>When we say these things, we are not saying that concepts, facts, and experiences do not occupy an important position. We need these facts and we need memory-style tests. But we must always recognize that memorizing these facts is not the ultimate goal, but a method of obtaining learning results. If we tend to preserve facts or remember what teachers say, we will inevitably overemphasize memory, ignore application, and acknowledge doing homework as real learning. Reflective thinking and adaptability will not be obtained.</p>
<p>Second, misunderstanding grades as a representation of academic performance. When students see that remembering more facts can get high grades, their minds turn to grades. As long as they get grades, they are willing to use any method—rote memorization, plagiarism, cheating. As a result, they fall to a lower level and cannot even achieve the point of doing homework. Not only have they not developed good behavior, but even bad attitudes have become deeply ingrained. And after setting a passing grade, students only seek to get by and are unwilling to study with all their heart and mind. Spiritual training is simply out of the question.</p>
<p>But some people also say that students with excellent grades in school seem to have a greater chance of success in society. Can grades represent performance? To answer this question, we must distinguish between different situations. If the student's purpose is to pursue grades and not to obtain real understanding and ability, then his grades may not represent performance. If the student's purpose is not grades, but he gets high grades because he has sustained attention, unremitting effort, keen discernment, and the ability to search and explore, then his grades can represent his attainments.</p>
<p>Grading is also very difficult. Real learning must obtain new responses and be applied in real situations. Repeating teaching materials does not necessarily indicate understanding. Only by creating a new realm can we test understanding and ability. To put it more thoroughly, only the practical problems that arise in life can test the results of learning.</p>

<h3>Japanese Warships Conduct Large-Scale Maneuvers in the Waters off Fujian and Taiwan</h3>
<p>More than 70 warships and 50,000 soldiers and sailors will conduct exercises for one week starting July 25th.</p>
<p>Fuzhou dispatch. After Japan decided to actively develop political and economic power in Fujian and Guangdong provinces, it increased the authority of the Governor-General of Taiwan, ordering him to command the consuls stationed in Fujian and Guangdong provinces. The Governor-General's Office of Taiwan convened a meeting of consuls stationed in Fujian and Guangdong provinces a month ago to discuss implementation plans and designated Magong as a naval base, prohibiting Chinese merchant ships from entering and exiting, and Keelung as an air force base, where a large airfield is currently under construction. Recently, fleets have been dispatched repeatedly from Taiwan, intruding into the territorial waters and inner harbors of our country's Fujian and Guangdong provinces for patrols. Moreover, strange airplanes have appeared from time to time along the coasts of eastern and southern Fujian, spying on strategic locations or taking pictures, with malicious intentions. Recently, Li Shijia, the commander of the Fuzhou naval port, and Lin Guogeng, the commander of the Xiamen naval port, jointly telegraphed the Ministry of the Navy, requesting that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs be consulted to inform the Japanese ambassador that if Japanese warships enter our country's harbors in the future, they should notify our local naval authorities in advance for reception, and should not enter and exit arbitrarily, as this would hinder coastal defense and disturb the people's minds. A large Japanese fleet, consisting of more than 70 warships and approximately 50,000 soldiers and sailors, is scheduled to conduct cross-sectional maneuvers in the waters bordering Taiwan and Fujian for one week starting on July 25th. The Japanese consul in Fujian requested that our country send personnel to observe the maneuvers. The provincial government replied yesterday, requesting that they not disturb coastal fishing boats and island residents during the maneuvers. It is also reported that after the large-scale Japanese naval maneuvers, preparations will be made for a full-scale air defense exercise on Taiwan Island. The Governor-General's Office of Taiwan has suspended logging on the entire island for ten years for the sake of arranging air defense, and will purchase wood for use from Fujian, having sent Gangtian Shang to Fujian to negotiate purchasing and transporting methods. In addition, recently, foreign monks have been discovered in various coastal areas, sneaking into various villages to investigate local conditions and troop deployments, or carrying cameras to secretly photograph strategic areas, which are suspected of espionage. The provincial government has repeatedly received reports from various parties and has ordered the governments of all counties to quickly check household registrations, and to detain and strictly interrogate anyone with an unclear origin, and to send personnel to secretly investigate to prevent unscrupulous elements from operating and undermining national defense. In addition, Taiwanese people are engaged in various illegal businesses in Fujian, such as opium dens, gambling dens, private pawnshops, and other illegal businesses. Although our government has repeatedly lodged protests and the Japanese consul has promised to ban them, it has not yet been implemented. (July 22nd)</p>
<h3>Serious Incident Occurs in Tianjin: Company Commander of the Municipal Government Guard Detained by Japanese Police Station; Special Agent Killed by Gunfire Due to Misunderstanding</h3>
<p>Tianjin dispatch. At 0:30 PM on the 22nd, a serious incident involving foreign relations occurred near the Jin'gang Bridge in Hebei, Tianjin. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Zhou Fengling, the company commander of the 7th Company of the Tianjin Municipal Government Guard Battalion, went to the Zhongyuan Company in the Japanese Concession in casual clothes on the evening of the 21st. A special agent from the Japanese Concession Police Station saw him and thought he looked suspicious. He searched Zhou's body, and although nothing was found, Zhou was still considered to be a bandit and taken to the Japanese Police Station, where he was brutally tortured and interrogated, ordered to confess the whereabouts of his accomplices and what cases he had committed. Zhou, under duress, dared not admit that he was a company commander of the Municipal Government Guard Battalion, but only confessed that he was a tea server at the Xiaoying Company at the Beining New Railway Station. At noon on the 22nd, the Japanese Police Station did not notify the Tianjin Public Security Bureau, and immediately sent Special Agent Candidate Patrol Chief Zhang Delu and Special Agent Zhang Xuanzhi to escort Zhou in Japanese Police Station car No. 963, driven by driver Chen Changtai, directly to the Hebei New Railway Station to verify Zhou's confession. At 0:30 PM, they arrived in front of the Municipal Government near the Jin'gang Bridge. Zhou struggled desperately, hoping that the guards in front of the Municipal Government would discover him and report to the mayor for rescue. Zhang Delu, who was escorting Zhou, immediately struck Zhou's lower body with a police baton. Zhou was beaten and shouted for help. The guards inside the Municipal Government heard the sound and came out to see. At that time, car No. 963 could not move forward and stopped on the side of the road. The guards saw that the person in the car was their company commander, and the two special agents were extremely fierce and humiliating him. In a moment of public outrage, without even asking the details, they tried to rescue Zhou. Zhang Delu, who had been torturing Zhou, fearing that Zhou would escape, pulled out his gun and fired a warning shot at Zhou's head. The guards became even more outraged and retaliated in the chaos. Zhang Delu was shot four times in the head and died instantly in the car. Zhang Xuanzhi jumped out of the car and fled to the nearby Dahua Dye Shop. Driver Chen Changtai, in a panic, ran to the Jintang River, intending to jump into the water to avoid bullets, but was stopped by a police officer on duty at the Jin'gang Bridge. After the incident, Zhou knew that his crime was too great and went to the Municipal Government to report. Car No. 963 and driver Chen Changtai were both taken to the Municipal Government. At that time, the Municipal Government was closing up after hours and no one was in charge. After reporting to Mayor Zhang Zizhong and Secretary-General Ma Yanchong, they rushed to the Municipal Government one after another and immediately summoned Zhou Fengling to investigate the truth. At this time, Zhang Xuanzhi had reported to the Japanese Police Station. Japanese Vice-Consul Nishida, Japanese Police Station Chief Wakui, Criminal Department Chief Owa, Judicial Section Chief Okayama, Police Department Chief Fujii, Japanese Army Headquarters Staff Officer Nakamura, and Military Police Branch Chief Ikegami all arrived at the scene of the incident to investigate. Many plainclothes special agents and police officers were also investigating and guarding the vicinity of the crime scene. For a time, traffic on Tian'an Road, South Road, and North Jin'gang Bridge was completely cut off, and there were thousands of onlookers. After the Japanese Police Station Military Police took photos, they entered the Municipal Government to visit Mayor Zhang Zizhong. Vice-Consul Nishida and Police Station Chief Wakui verbally protested, reserving their rights to investigate and demand in this case. The two sides talked for a long time, until three o'clock, when Nishida left. Wakui and Ikegami waited for the prosecutor from the District Procuratorate to complete the examination before returning to the station. At 5:30, the District Court sent Prosecutor Tu Zhang to examine the body. Afterwards, he filled out the death certificate, which was taken by the Japanese side. The body was then transported to the Japanese Concession Police Station and handed over to its family for burial. In the evening, car No. 963 and driver Chen Changtai were both released after being interrogated by the Municipal Government. In addition to urgently reporting the facts to Song Zheyuan, Zhang Zizhong also sent Councillors Chen Dongsheng and Lu Nansheng to visit Japanese Consul-General Tajiri, Chief of Staff of the Japanese Garrison Headquarters Nagami, Commander of the Military Police Headquarters Fujii, and Police Station Chief Wakui to explain that this case was under investigation and that if it was the fault of the company commander of the Guard Battalion, it would not be tolerated and would be dealt with severely. As of the evening of the 22nd, the Japanese side had not made any serious statements. In addition to detaining Zhou Fengling, the authorities were investigating the truth of the incident and were doing their best to eliminate the tense atmosphere in foreign relations, hoping that no more serious problems would arise as a result. According to Cheng Xixian, the director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, the incident was unfortunate, but the Japanese Police Station did not notify our side in advance, resulting in this misunderstanding, which is deeply regrettable. Zhang Delu's open firing in the Chinese territory was the main cause of this case. Therefore, in future negotiations, this point may be used as a tool to reduce the seriousness of the incident, which is also unknown. (July 22nd)</p>
<h3>Smuggling in Southern Fujian Has Somewhat Subsided; Tax Inspectors Cooperate in Apprehending Along the Coast; Customs Revenue of Fuzhou and Xiamen Increases</h3>
<p>Xiamen dispatch. The trend of smuggling in Fujian Province was rampant at one time between last winter and this spring. After the Third Pacification District cracked down on the smuggling agency Nanxin Foreign Firm in Shishi, the large-scale secret smuggling agency in Southern Fujian disintegrated. Subsequently, the Provincial Government established a Tax Inspection Office, setting up sixteen branch offices along the coast, and the trend gradually subsided with joint land and sea arrests. The Provincial Tax Inspection Office recently sent Zhen Yaogong and Wang Rulin to inspect smuggling affairs in Southern Fujian. They arrived in Xiamen on the 21st. According to Wang, "This trip passed through Quanzhou, Anhai, Zhangzhou, Shima, Zhangpu, Jiuzhen, Fotan, Yi'an, Meizhou, Yunxiao, and other places, and the results were very good. The trend of smuggling in various places has gradually subsided, and the customs revenue of Fuzhou and Xiamen has been increasing month by month. The most rampant smuggling in Southern Fujian is in Zhangpu and Jiuzhen. Since the establishment of inspection branch offices, smugglers have been repeatedly cracked down on, and all have been transferred to Chihu, Fotan, and Yunxiao for unloading via Meizhou. We are currently intercepting and arresting in this direction. The smuggling in Xiamen is that general smugglers transport imported smuggled goods to the interior. When reporting goods for transportation, they often report more than they actually have to the tax bureau, concealing and evading transportation. Today, we discussed with the Xiamen Finance Bureau that from now on, when merchants transfer goods to the interior and pay taxes, the tax forms must be investigated truthfully to see if they match, to prevent smuggling evasion. Xiamen is a small island, and smuggled imported goods must be transported to the interior to have a way out. If the Xiamen Tax Bureau and the inland inspection offices can strictly intercept their outlets, Xiamen smugglers will be no different from being sentenced to death. Currently, coastal anti-smuggling in Fujian Province is temporarily the responsibility of the Security Corps. The Inspection Office decided to organize a tax police regiment within one month, divided into three brigades, which will be distributed to various coastal areas to fight smuggling after its establishment," and so on.

<h3>Harsh Examples of Restrictions on Chinese Workers in Taiwan</h3>
<p>Chinese businessmen and general overseas Chinese all suffer cruel treatment.</p>
<p>Xiamen dispatch. The Taiwan authorities have recently increased the number of Chinese workers going to Taiwan, with a total of more than 7,000 people from January to June. Ten thousand Taiwanese people have lost their jobs as a result, so they blame it on the excessive number of Chinese workers entering the country and restrict their entry. Chinese workers go to Taiwan because they are recruited by Taiwan's military and mining industries. Now that they feel there is a surplus, they are adding restrictions. The restriction methods are: (1) A certificate to go to Taiwan must be guaranteed by a Taiwanese person or a local shop, and each person must pay four yen. This type of traveler is mostly a property owner or tourist, and the treatment is quite polite. (2) Ordinary businessmen who have a passport from our Ministry of Foreign Affairs must first obtain a passport from the local government, paying a fee of 4.6 yuan, and then ask the local Japanese consul to sign it, paying a visa fee of four yuan. (3) Laborers must go through import procedures handled by the Nangoku Company, which was established by the Japanese. It is located in ports that have direct shipping routes to Taiwan and was established 37 years ago. Laborers who go to Taiwan must first have photos taken and vaccinated at a photo studio and hospital designated by the company. Then, the company will issue a worker's passport. They must pay a handling fee and fare of ten yuan in Xiamen to obtain a worker's passport. After arriving in Taiwan, the passport must be carried with them at all times and cannot be separated from them for even a moment. Those who forget to bring it when they are inspected are fined 50 yuan. Moreover, Chinese workers in Taiwan can never change jobs and are treated like slaves. Even if they have some savings and want to abandon being a Chinese worker and go into business, they are not allowed. During their stay, they are constantly summoned by the Japanese police. If their answers are slightly hesitant, they will be immediately detained and sent back to Xiamen. Those who are deemed unsatisfactory by the Japanese police are also detained and sent back. Some of the Chinese workers who are sent back are penniless and become beggars. The restrictions on businessmen in Taiwan used to be relatively lenient, but recently, Taiwanese businessmen who have a passport from our Ministry of Foreign Affairs and have completed the formalities are often strictly inspected by the Japanese police and are required to carry 200-300 yuan in cash with them to be recognized as businessmen going to Taiwan. Otherwise, they will be considered workers, or those with a rough appearance will also be considered workers, and their passport from our Ministry of Foreign Affairs will be revoked, and they will have to pay another five yen to be issued a worker's passport, so they will not be able to change jobs in Taiwan for the rest of their lives. Although the Japanese police are strict with Chinese workers, they do not pay attention to their thinking and social activities because they are not intellectuals. Those who obtain worker's passports to avoid the attention of the Japanese police will be punished, detained, or sent back if they are found out. The Nangoku Company, which handles the import of Chinese workers, has recently been ordered by the Taiwan authorities to restrict Chinese workers from going to Taiwan, using the number of Chinese workers needed in Taiwan and the amount as the standard. In addition, those who have trachoma or other infectious diseases are also not allowed to go to Taiwan. The Taiwan authorities' reason for restricting Chinese workers and Chinese from entering the country is that the number of unemployed local Taiwanese people has increased sharply, which they blame on the excessive number of Chinese workers and Chinese entering the country. In fact, the unemployment of Taiwanese people is due to the Japanese implementing strict control in Taiwan. Most of the larger industrial and commercial businesses and raw material agriculture that Taiwanese people have always operated have been taken over by the Japanese and merged into large enterprises organized by the Japanese. After the merger, the number of employees used gives priority to hiring Japanese people, and the rationalization of large enterprises requires fewer personnel than individual operators, so the unemployment of Taiwanese people is increasing, not being seized by Chinese workers and Chinese.

<h3>Anhui Provincial Government Moves Forward: Anhui-Guangdong Rice and Sugar Exchange Sales; Anhui Province Has Bumper Rice Harvest, New Goods Appear on the Market at Low Prices</h3>
<p>Wuhu dispatch. Rice, a special agricultural product of Anhui Province, used to export 6-7 million shi annually from Wuhu port during its peak, with Guangdong being the largest sales market. However, since the invasion of foreign rice, the Guangdong market has been monopolized. In recent years, the value of rice shipped from Annam, Siam, and other foreign countries to Guangdong Province has exceeded 70 million yuan, and the amount of Anhui rice needed is only one-tenth or one-twelfth of what it used to be. The prosperity or decline of Anhui rice trade is related to the economic lifeline of Anhui Province, and this situation is no longer something that merchants can save. Guangdong's trade goods with Anhui were originally dominated by white sugar. In recent years, the province has worked hard to develop sugar production and has added five new-style sugar mills. The annual sugar production has increased to more than 60,000 tons. Now it is also seeking a way out to prevent oversupply. The Anhui Provincial Government intends to take this opportunity to try political means to revive the rice market, that is, to imitate the method of exchanging and promoting special products agreed by the Shanxi and Suiyuan provinces, and to mutually sell Anhui rice and Guangdong sugar. Guangdong sugar is suitable for the needs of Anhui Province, which is enough to achieve mutual benefit. It is currently being planned and will be realized in the near future. The finances of all industries in Anhui Province may have a turning point towards activity. This year's agricultural affairs in Anhui Province have been blessed with timely sunny and rainy weather, and even distribution of water and drought. Rice has already had a bumper harvest, and the new early rice has already appeared on the market. The entire autumn harvest is in sight, and the market price has fallen sharply. The opening price of the new market is only around 6.56 yuan. At the same time, the old rice stockpiled by various rice industries is being forced to open warehouses and sell urgently, so the rice price still has a downward trend. Under this environment, in addition to rushing to complete the construction of 48 county agricultural warehouses, which are under construction, to facilitate adjustment, it is also necessary to promote the exchange and sales of Anhui rice and Guangdong sugar as soon as possible. (July 22nd)</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Transfer of Jurisdiction for Xu Wancheng</p>
<p>Xu Wancheng, an editor at the Shanghai Longwen Bookstore, previously published a periodical in Shanghai titled "Xu Wancheng's Work Report." The Shanghai Local Court deemed some of the writing therein, which criticized judges of the Shanghai Local Court, as obstructing official duties. Xu was arrested and detained, and bail was denied. Xu then petitioned the Jiangsu High Court for a transfer of jurisdiction. The High Court approved the transfer to the Wu County Local Court on the twenty-third. It is said that within days, the Shanghai Local Court will be instructed to transfer Xu to Suzhou for interrogation.</p>
<p>Thorough Investigation of Nie Dezhao's Case</p>
<p>Nie Dezhao, the commander of the 7th Security Brigade of Suzhou Province, is accused of embezzling opium addicts' prison rations and selling military equipment, among other charges. Zang, the Special Commissioner of the Second District, sent Zhang Zhuoyu to Suzhou to investigate. Zhang has since returned to Wuxi to report. Deng Xianghai, the Magistrate of Wu County, traveled to Wuxi on the twenty-second to consult with Special Commissioner Zang on how to proceed. He returned to Suzhou the same evening. Special Commissioner Zang is also paying close attention to this case and has decided to come to Suzhou himself for a thorough investigation to clarify the facts. It is said that the contents of the case are quite complex and involve many people.</p>
<p>Various Industries Organize Anti-Smuggling Associations</p>
<p>In order to prevent smuggling, the County Chamber of Commerce has already organized an Anti-Smuggling Committee to strictly prevent smuggling. It has also notified relevant industries to organize their respective anti-smuggling associations and implement a system of issuing licenses and distributing goods. Currently, the coal industry and the Chinese and foreign cloth industries have successively established anti-smuggling associations. Trade associations such as silk weaving, Chinese and foreign sundry goods, and transportation of sundry goods are also in the process of organizing anti-smuggling associations and will be established within days.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Melon Boat Robbed at Night</p>
<p>Watermelons are on the market in the hot summer. The produce from the area west of Mudu is considered the best, and there is fierce competition for sales in the city. Tang Xiaodi and others, residents outside the West Gate, pooled their money to become watermelon vendors. They took a boat to the countryside to buy watermelons. Unexpectedly, while sailing on the West Lake near Zhang's Tomb Bridge, it was already midnight when they were suddenly intercepted by a pirate ship. All the watermelons were robbed, and the clothing of everyone on board was also stripped away. Tang was wounded by the robbers for resisting. Because they had no money to buy more watermelons, they had to return with an empty boat. They have now reported the incident to the authorities for investigation.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Aftermath of the Silk Factory Strike</p>
<p>The Wuxi silk factory strike has been settled through the efforts of the Party and government, and a deep understanding has been reached between labor and management. Satisfactory results have been achieved on issues such as wage standards, working hours, bonuses, and holidays. Work resumed in full on the twenty-first. The Silk Factory Association also held a general membership meeting at 5:00 PM on the twenty-second to discuss in detail issues such as internal reorganization and wage regulations. Unexpectedly, a small number of family members of workers still in custody on suspicion of instigation, and other undesirable elements, felt that the settlement of the strike was detrimental to them. They spread various rumors, causing only twenty or thirty female workers to report to the Yongtai and Zhang Liangyuan Yongchang factories outside the South Gate that afternoon. Although calls for work were made again yesterday morning, the female workers still did not report to work. The two factories have reported the matter to the Party and government, as well as the General Labor Union, for handling.</p>
<p>Rectification of Grain Reserves in Various Counties</p>
<p>Zang Qifang, the Special Commissioner of the Second District Administrative Inspectorate, believes that the grain reserves in each county should be sufficient to meet the needs of the entire county population for six months. Each county, district, township, and town should establish a granary, and granaries should also be set up at suitable locations for separate storage. However, the regulations for grain requisition should apply equally to farmers and merchants, with no distinction. However, merchants may pay in cash instead of grain. Yesterday, he specifically ordered the counties under his jurisdiction to vigorously promote the expansion of existing charitable granaries. Counties where granaries have not yet been built may temporarily borrow public buildings or temples and civilian houses. The deadline for the completion of all county granaries is the end of December of this year.</p>
<p>Long Shengwu Passes Through Wuxi on His Way to Beijing</p>
<p>Long Yun, Chairman of the Yunnan Provincial Government, specially sent his son, Long Shengwu, to Beijing to negotiate important matters.

<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Sixty-Year-Old Man Murdered</p>
<p>Tong Degen, a resident of the 14th household of the 2nd Jia of the 2nd Bao of Zhongshan Town (Wenheng Bridge Hongjian Street) in the city, currently delivers newspapers for the Liuhe Telegraph Office. His wife, Sanmei, has been engaging in immoral behavior. A man from Zhenjiang named Zhang Goulang, sixty-two years old, who used to run a dim sum shop in Kunshan, came to Jiangyin to visit his uncle, Zhang Aliu. Three days ago, Tong Sanmei, seeing his pitiful state, invited him to stay at their home. Last night (the 21st), he was suddenly murdered with a kitchen knife. It was not discovered until dawn on the 22nd. The incident was reported to the Public Security Bureau, which in turn reported it to the county. Investigator Shen Cheng went to examine the body. The throat was cut, severing the three tubes. The murderer is unknown, and the cause of death is unclear. The landlady, Tong Sanmei, and neighbors such as Gu Ruyang were taken to the county for questioning.</p>
<p>Postal Worker Convicted of Embezzlement</p>

<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Japanese Fishing Vessels Illegally Cross Border</p>
<p>The Shengsi Islands in Chongming County, under the jurisdiction of Nantong, are a famous fishing area in our country. Recently, Japanese fishing vessels have frequently crossed the border to fish and have dragged away the fishing nets laid by our fishermen in the sea. The fishermen have repeatedly requested relief from the county government. Gu Hongxi, the Magistrate of Chongming County, came to Nantong to report to the Special Commissioner's Office. Special Commissioner Ge telegraphed the provincial government for instructions.</p>

<p>Collapse of the Shellfish Cooperative</p>
<p>The Yinjiang Shellfish Cooperative, the only large-scale cooperative of its kind in the country, has been virtually suspended for more than a month due to financial difficulties. The authorities have no effective relief measures, making it impossible to revive. It is now reported that the cooperative is clearing its accounts and will announce its dissolution within a week.</p>
<h3>Bengbu</h3>
<p>Two Major Bandits Hiding the Ransom Victim Captured</p>
<p>Zhou Zhixiu, Fan Guiying, Sun Guilan and other major bandits who roamed northern Anhui, gathered a crowd of bandits some months ago and kidnapped the farmer Bai Zhenfang and his son Bai Xianrui in the Baijia Lake area of Huaiyuan County. Subsequently, the Bai family reported the case to the Huaiyuan County Government and requested their arrest. The county government dispatched teams to search and arrest them in different directions. The bandits Zhou and Fan, seeing that the government's arrest was imminent, secretly took Bai Xianrui to Bengbu and hid him in a recruitment office of a certain division on Zhongzheng Street, in order to extort a ransom nearby. This was discovered by the Huaiyuan County Government, which dispatched county police and militia on the morning of the twenty-first at 7:00 AM, together with the staff of the Second District Office, to surround the bandit den according to the address. Unexpectedly, the bandits opened fire to resist arrest, wounding a county policeman. The police and militia also returned fire. Ultimately, the bandits were outnumbered and overwhelmed. Zhou Zhixiu was shot and fell to the ground on the spot, and Fan Guiying was also captured. Sun Guilan took the opportunity to escape. The ransom victim, Bai Xianrui, was also rescued. At 10:00 AM, the Huaiyuan County police and militia escorted the two bandits, Zhou and Fan, and the ransom victim onto a small steamer to be taken to the county. After the boat traveled three miles, Zhou, who was injured and untied, jumped into the river and committed suicide. When the boat stopped and searched for him, he had already drifted away without a trace.</p>

<h3>Huang Guangrui and Liu Jiwen Arrive in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Huang Takes the Afternoon Flight to Beijing, Liu Enters the Capital Later – Will Visit Lin and Chiang in Lushan Today</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Liu Jiwen, the Mayor of Guangzhou, and Huang Guangrui, the Commander of the Air Force, traveled together on the Italian postal ship Victoria from Hong Kong and arrived in Shanghai at 9:30 AM yesterday morning, docking at the North Bund Wharf of the China Merchants Bureau. Mayor Wu's representative, Yu Hongjun; the Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Cai Jingjun; the Secretary of the Municipal Government, Tang Shixuan; Li Jingzong, the General Manager of the Eurasia Aviation Corporation; and Wen Zhouhua, the Deputy Commander of the Security General Regiment, all went to the wharf to welcome them. Liu and Huang disembarked around 10:00 AM and went directly to the International Hotel to rest. In addition to Liu's wife, Ms. Xu Shuzhen, many senior generals of the Guangdong Air Force also came with them.</p>
<p>Mayor's Banquet</p>
<p>Mayor Wu hosted a banquet at the International Hotel at 12:30 PM yesterday to welcome Liu and Huang. Secretary-General of the Municipal Government Yu Hongjun, Songhu Garrison Commander Yang Hu, and Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau Cai Jingjun, and many others were invited to accompany them. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves until after 2:00 PM.</p>
<p>Huang Flies to Beijing First</p>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, Liu and Huang immediately telegraphed reports to Beijing and Lushan. The Military Affairs Commission specially sent three planes to Shanghai to welcome them. Huang, along with his subordinates, took the three planes from Hongqiao Airport at around 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon and flew to Beijing. Those who went to the airport to see them off included Yu Hongjun, Cai Jingjun, Li Dachao, and Wen Huazhou. Liu did not travel with them.</p>
<p>Liu's Talk</p>
<p>According to Liu Jiwen, he came to request instructions from the central government on the Guangdong post-disaster issues. Among the post-disaster issues, reorganizing finance is the most important and also the most difficult. When he left Guangdong, the province was quite peaceful. He did not know the details of the rumors of the Guard Army's rebellion. However, the Guard Army has a small number of people and there should not be any problem. As for the current situation in Guangxi and the attitude of those in charge, he did not hear anything because he was traveling in a hurry.</p>
<p>(Front row, from left) Huang Guangrui, Liu Jiwen, Yu Hongjun, and Cai Jingjun (Photo by International News Agency)</p>
<p>Huang's Talk</p>
<p>According to a written statement released by Huang Guangrui on the ship, (Q) What was the cause of the Guangdong Air Force's secession from the Southwest, and what was the process at that time? (A) Air Force comrades have always adhered to the Premier's instruction to save the country through aviation. Everyone is of one mind. If it is not for the sake of the cause and for the sake of saving the people, we will never sacrifice ourselves. We especially oppose civil war. This Southwest openly advocates resistance against Japan, but the name and reality do not match. Moreover, it borrows military officers from a certain country to participate in the war, provoking internal strife, and the disaster is imminent. In order to preserve the local area, preserve the lifeline of the country, and preserve the glory of the group, we must make a clear statement to promote Commander-in-Chief Chen Bonan's awakening. We have never received any movement or assistance from anyone beforehand. It is purely the consensus of all officers and soldiers to unanimously support the central government, unify military power, and eliminate civil war from now on. Therefore, at dawn on July 18, I personally led the squadron leaders of all squadrons under my command to fly all sixty-five large and small warplanes in Guangdong to Shaoguan for concentration, waiting for orders to advance or retreat. At that time, all flight personnel enthusiastically obeyed orders and competed to be pilots. After the planes took off, the Guangdong military police were not aware of it. The other planes were led by squadron leaders Tan Shou, Tao Zuode, Xie Mang, Ao Yuanqing, Ma Tinghuai, He Jingwei, Guo Hanting, Deng Xiangan, and deputy squadron leader Yu Binwei, and others, and flew to Shaoguan. I, along with Chief of Staff Chen Zhuolin, Principal Hu Hanxian, and Director Wu Jianwen, and others, flew four planes to Hong Kong. Soon after, hundreds of unarmed pilots, mechanics, and other staff members successively went to Hong Kong for concentration, breaking away from the Southwest relationship. Currently, a part of my troops is stationed in Shaoguan, and a part is stationed in Nanchang. They will be transferred back to Guangdong in the coming days for centralized waiting for orders. (Q) What is the mission of this trip and the schedule for the round trip? (A) To meet with Chairman Lin, Chairman Chiang, and other senior officials to express the sincerity of the Guangdong Air Force officers and soldiers in supporting the central government, and to report on the past work and request instructions on the future training strategy. I will also go to Nanchang to comfort my troops. I will first go to Beijing and then go to Nanchang, Ji'an, or Shaoguan, or return to Guangdong via Shanghai for further instructions.</p>

<h3>Guangdong Banking Industry Association Telegraphed to Advise Li Bai</h3>
<p>Obey the Central Government</p>
<p>The Guangdong Banking Industry Association in this city telegraphed Li Bai of Guangxi Province, saying: Commander-in-Chief Li Delin, Deputy Commander Bai Jiansheng, please take note. Ever since Guangdong and Guangxi used the name of resisting Japan to brew civil war, public opinion across the country has been in an uproar, and everyone has unanimously called for a halt. Fortunately, the generals of our Guangdong have a deep understanding of righteousness and cannot bear to engage in fratricide and internal strife. They have embraced unification and returned to the central government, so the overall situation has been dramatically reversed and the country has been spared division. The resolutions of the Second Plenary Session also strive to avoid military methods that corrupt the local area and damage the country's strength in the midst of rectifying discipline, and only dismiss one military leader. Therefore, the homeland is fortunately preserved. As for those who participated in the anomalies, not only have they not been punished or disciplined, but they have also been entrusted with important posts and are greatly favored, demonstrating the central government's painstaking efforts to comprehensively consider and impartially quell the unrest, which is worthy of admiration. Now, Chen Bonan has telegraphed Chairman Chiang, obeying the order to step down and return military and political power to the central government, and Yu Woqi, the army commander appointed to clean up the situation in Guangdong, is also stationed in Shaoguan and will return to the provincial capital in the coming days. It will be seen that the gloomy and miserable situation in Guangdong will suddenly turn from danger to safety and gradually become peaceful. We are deeply gratified. However, according to the news reports, you have intentions to send troops into Guangdong, and the situation is serious, and war will inevitably resume. In that case, the security of the homeland and the dawn of unity will once again be plunged into despair by you. We are very concerned for you. Today, public opinion across the country holds that unifying government orders and concentrating forces are essential for resisting foreign aggression. If you hope to engage in cunning schemes and stubborn resistance, you will inevitably repeat the mistakes of Chen in Guangdong. We hope you will wake up and consider the central government's earnest expectations and the urgency of the country's crisis. Return the troops to Guangxi as soon as possible to obey the orders of the central government, consolidate domestic peace and unity, resist foreign aggression, and seek survival. The benefits will be profound. This telegram is sent to you in the hope that you will understand. Signed, Guangdong Banking Industry Association.</p>
<h3>Various Circles Purchase Aircraft to Celebrate Birthday</h3>
<p>Lin Bingyan Donates 10,000 Yuan Alone, The Cabin Department Donates More Than 3,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Guangdong Association of Fellow Provincials in Shanghai has been very enthusiastic about purchasing aircraft to celebrate a birthday. They have sent letters to various directors to solicit donations separately. The achievements made have been reported in various newspapers. It is now learned that Lin Bingyan, a director of the association, in addition to donating 10,000 yuan of national currency alone, and Director Cui Pinxi, have also raised 100 yuan from He Shanhong, 10 yuan from Liang Shaopeng, 50 yuan from Sheng Chunlin, 50 yuan from Chen Zhenxia, 20 yuan from Ming Changfu, 100 yuan from Taihe Xing Bank, 100 yuan from Hesheng Company, 20 yuan from Cui Tingdong, 10 yuan from Cui Defeng, 2 yuan from Mei Guanchun, 10 yuan from Ruan Dazhu, 2 yuan from Ma Guichang, 2 yuan from Tang Qifu, 2 yuan from Cui Huige, 2 yuan from He Minsheng, and 100 yuan donated by Lian Cui himself, totaling 350 yuan. All of these have been received by Li Dachao, the association's stable affairs officer, who has submitted them to the aircraft purchase birthday celebration committee and received receipts. The committee received the sixth batch of donations from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, amounting to 590 yuan, and 300 yuan from the Jianghai Customs Supervisory Office. All cabin members of the Chinese Seamen's Union voluntarily donated 4 yuan in legal tender per person, which was collected by the cabin office and then transferred. It is now learned that the gold has been delivered: 340 yuan in national currency from cabin members of the Jiang'an wheel, 440 yuan in national currency from cabin members of the Xinjiangtian second class, 56 yuan in national currency from cabin members of the Wenzhou wheel, 244 yuan from cabin members of the Ruihe transport, 180 yuan from cabin members of the Wuhu wheel, 224 yuan in national currency from cabin members of the Xinming wheel, 40 yuan in national currency from cabin members of the Yushun transport, 80 yuan in national currency from cabin members of the Wulin transport, 380 yuan in national currency from the cabin food staff of the Jiangxin wheel, 420 yuan in national currency from the cabin members of the Jianghua wheel, 156 yuan from the cabin members of the Xianghe wheel, 264 yuan in national currency from the cabin members of the Jiangda wheel, 120 yuan in national currency from the cabin members of the Haiyan wheel, 160 yuan in national currency from the cabin members of the Wuxue wheel, and 384 yuan in national currency from the cabin members of the Jianguo wheel, totaling 3,492 yuan. Many more ships' crew members have made preparations and will pay when the ships return to Shanghai one after another. However, the seamen of this department, under the current shipping depression, live in hardship. Although they drift at sea all day, they deeply know how to love the country and support the leader, saving their hard-earned money to buy airplanes to save the country. Their sincerity is worthy of admiration. It is also learned that the stevedores and freight handlers also have their own expressions, but the number is still unknown.</p>

<h3>Import of Foreign Cotton Seeds Only Allowed Through Shanghai to Facilitate Inspection and Disinfection, Effective August 1 This Year</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry previously approved the National Economic Commission's Cotton Industry Control Committee's request that, before the plant and insect pest inspections are universally implemented in various inspection bureaus, the import of foreign cotton seeds should only be allowed through Shanghai in order to facilitate inspection and disinfection. After the Ministry of Industry consulted the Ministry of Finance for review, it also ordered the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau to comply. It is now learned that the Ministry of Industry has approved the Ministry of Finance's consultation, according to the report submitted by the Inspector General of Customs, that it will be implemented from August 1 this year. In addition to requesting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to notify the governments of various countries to inform their exporting merchants, the Shanghai Inspection Bureau was also ordered to inform them. After receiving the order, the bureau has dispatched personnel to contact the Jianghai Customs Commissioner to coordinate the procedures.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Chambers of Commerce from Various Provinces, Cities, and Counties Petition in Beijing Last Night, Requesting Amendments to the Chamber of Commerce Law and Trade Association Law, Implementing Income Tax After First Eliminating Disguised Likin Taxes, and Revising Article 681 of the Civil Code and Partnership Liabilities</h3>
<p>Representatives from chambers of commerce of twenty-one provinces, cities, and counties, acting upon the resolution of the joint conference, led by the presidium members Wang Xiaolai, Yu Rongqiao, Yuan Duanfu, Yu Xiaochuan, and Cai Chang, departed from the Shanghai North Station yesterday, taking the Shanghai-Beijing through train at 4 PM and the Beijing-Shanghai overnight express train at 11 PM to petition in Beijing. After arriving in Beijing this morning, they will gather at the Nanjing Chamber of Commerce at 9 AM to submit petitions to the Central Party Headquarters, the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry, requesting the elimination of disguised likin taxes before implementing income tax, and the amendment of the Chamber of Commerce Law, the Trade Association Law, and commercial laws regarding partnership liabilities. The original text of the three petitions is recorded below:</p>
<p>Petition One: Regarding the matter of submitting a petition, the affiliated associations, in order to assist in smuggling suppression, address tax system issues, and revise commercial laws, convened a joint conference in Shanghai on the 20th of this month at the invitation of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. The discussion of various cases concluded on the 22nd of this month. Regarding smuggling suppression, it is proposed to establish a National Smuggling Suppression Association in Shanghai to supervise local industries and businesses, strictly investigate whether there are privately imported and tax-evading goods, and conduct spot checks and register their inventories at any time. Regarding the tax system, (1) it is requested that the Ministry of Finance eliminate disguised likin taxes in various provinces by a set deadline, such as the production and sales tax in Hunan, the bandit suppression and reconstruction donation in Jiangxi, various special taxes in Guangdong, the landing tax in Sichuan, the silkworm silk improvement fee in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and the special consumption tax in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Yunnan. (2) It is requested that the Ministry of Finance implement income tax only after all disguised likin taxes have been eliminated and foreign nationals can pay taxes uniformly according to regulations. Regarding commercial laws, they fall into three major categories: (1) Regarding the liability of partners for debts, it should follow the compromise method adopted by the Legislative Yuan in October of the 23rd year of the Republic. If a partner registers their name, address, and capital contribution with the government, they should be liable for sharing losses according to their capital contribution. The draft Commercial Registration Law proposed by the Legislative Yuan in October of that year should be promptly deliberated and passed. If the Commercial Registration Law is considered a procedural law and partnership debt is stipulated in Article 681 of the Debt Section of the Civil Code, and it is inconvenient to change the substantive law with procedural law, it is requested that the compromise method proposed in October of that year be added after Article 681 of the Civil Code for reference and to avoid obstacles. This principle has already been submitted to the Legislative Yuan. (2) In the Trade Association Law, the following articles should be amended as appropriate: (A) The provision that a trade association can only be organized if there are at least seven businesses in the same industry is too restrictive. When businesses in the same industry believe that it is necessary to organize a trade association, they should be allowed to apply for establishment without being subject to this restriction. (B) In addition to the articles of association, trade associations should formulate industry rules through the consensus of the industry to standardize prices, limit production, and set quality standards. These industry rules should be considered part of the articles of association, and those who violate them should be subject to penalties and confiscation of their goods in violation of the agreement. If necessary, they may appeal to the court for a judgment to be enforced. (C) If businesses in the same industry do not comply with the provisions of Article 7 of the Trade Association Law to join the association, the government may impose sanctions, or even order them to suspend their business. (3) In the Chamber of Commerce Law, the following articles should be amended as appropriate: (A) Clearly define the organizational system of commercial groups to maintain a close relationship between trade associations and chambers of commerce. (B) Chambers of commerce should have the right to express opinions when amending laws and regulations. (C) If a trade association does not join the chamber of commerce, or joins but does not fulfill its due obligations, the competent authority may reorganize or rectify the trade association or punish its officers. (D) The number of executive and supervisory committee members of the chamber of commerce should be appropriately increased. The above points have all been drafted into articles and submitted separately to the Legislative Yuan and the Ministry of Industry. The undersigned believes that your association has the responsibility to lead people's groups and preside over national administration. All of the above-mentioned resolutions should be presented to your association by the representatives attending this session, along with a petition, and respectfully request that your association be informed of everything and that you grant separate instructions for the public convenience. Respectfully submitted to the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang and the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>Petition Two: Regarding the matter of submitting a petition, it is noted that the current Chamber of Commerce Law and Trade Association Law were deliberated, decided, and promulgated around the 18th year of the Republic, and more than seven years have passed since then. Recently, with the rapid invasion of the world economic tide and the unchecked smuggling in North China, the upper and lower levels of society unanimously feel that if the organizational strength of commercial groups is not strengthened so that they can lead the industry and command flexibly, the national economy will be on the verge of total collapse. The affiliated associations, in view of the importance of their responsibility, convened a joint conference in Shanghai at the invitation of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. The issue discussed, in addition to assisting in the detection of smuggled goods, was the amendment of the Chamber of Commerce Law and the Trade Association Law as the main agenda item of this session. Now, the joint associations of provincial chambers of commerce of seven provinces and the chambers of commerce of fourteen cities and counties have drafted several articles for revising the Chamber of Commerce Law and the Trade Association Law, representing their humble opinions. The chambers of commerce attending this conference have each appointed one representative to present everything to your Yuan (Department). This document is prepared and submitted to request your review and adoption for implementation, for the sake of the public interest. In addition to submitting it separately to the Ministry of Industry (Legislative Yuan), respectfully submitted to the Legislative Yuan (Ministry of Industry).</p>
<p>Petition Three: Regarding the matter of submitting a petition, the affiliated associations, in order to assist in the issue of detecting smuggled goods, convened a joint conference in Shanghai at the invitation of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. They deeply believe that the quality of the national tax system is closely related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. If the roots of bad taxes are not completely eradicated, the people's livelihood will be haggard, and even good taxes will have no hope of being implemented. As for good taxes, they also have their own conditions for implementation. Since the tax system imitates advanced countries in Europe and the United States, special phenomena that are unique to our country but not found in advanced countries should also be improved one by one to avoid bad results from good taxes. This is not an overstatement by the affiliated associations. The collection of customs duties is relatively simple, yet there is still the issue of unchecked smuggling today. How much more complex is income tax, and the situation is almost ten times that of customs duties. In addition to the special circumstances in North China, there are still so-called registered residents in Shantou and Xiamen, which are sufficient to hinder future tax collection. Not only foreign nationals, not only concessions, and not only foreign banks, if they cannot all be brought into compliance, reckless collection will lead to cunning people competing to evade taxes, and the national wealth will be transferred to foreign coffers. The state's revenue will be minimal, and its vitality will be almost exhausted. Without considering the risk of presumption, the affiliated associations have made earnest requests in their telegrams some days ago. Now, each of the chambers of commerce attending this conference has appointed one representative to prepare a petition and respectfully submit everything to your department, hoping for your review and approval to eliminate disguised likin taxes in various provinces by a set deadline, and to complete the procedures for uniformly collecting income tax from foreign nationals in advance, so that the collection of income tax will be simultaneous and equal for Chinese and foreign residents, without priority or distinction, in order to conform to the noble intention of your department to strive to promote good taxes. How can we not urgently await your orders! Respectfully submitted to the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3>Salt Affairs Administration: Improving Salt Administration</h3>
<p>Preparing to Implement the New Salt Law</p>
<p>Shenshi News Agency reports that since the promulgation of the new salt law last year, the Salt Affairs Administration has first rectified the working guidelines of salt fields in various provinces, proceeding according to the two principles of free trade and on-site tax collection of the new salt law, and actively improving the balance of production and sales and tax revenue. The organization's plan for promoting the new salt law is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Matters for Rectification</p>
<p>China's salt administration has adhered to old methods for thousands of years, and it is still not sound, which has a significant impact on national tax revenue and people's food. Since the promulgation of the new salt law last year, the Salt Affairs Administration has decided to thoroughly reform the salt administration, cancel the division of shores, reorganize salt fields, ban local saltpeter salt, standardize quality, and improve the lives of salt farmers, all of which are matters that urgently need to be rectified in today's salt administration.</p>
<p>Reorganizing Salt Fields</p>
<p>China's salt fields are very scattered and difficult to manage, and it is extremely difficult to collect taxes on-site, which is bound to lead to tax evasion. Therefore, reorganizing salt fields is the most important task, which is to merge salt fields and build warehouses. The indispensable steps are three: (1) Investigate salt field production and survey salt field areas, making a detailed report on the area of salt fields, the number of warehouses, transportation, production costs, salt quality, and the lives of salt farmers, and then study reorganization methods based on this report. (2) Merge salt fields and establish salt fields. Many salt fields have low yields, high costs, weak brine, and overly fragmented plots. These salt fields should be abolished and arrangements should be made for the resettlement of unemployed salt farmers in the abolished areas, while providing relief to salt farmers, transforming salt into agriculture, and opening up ponds and ditches in salt fields, diverting water to dilute the soil, improving the soil, and converting salt into reclamation. (3) Build warehouses and repair roads and open ditches to improve salt field management and avoid tax evasion.</p>
<p>Improving Manufacturing</p>
<p>China's salt production has always adhered to ancient methods, with little improvement. Therefore, the salt quality is very poor. However, in the future, with the implementation of the new salt law, free trade, and the breaking of the salt transport permit system, inferior salt will inevitably be difficult to sell competitively. Therefore, improving manufacturing is essential: (1) Inspect salt quality to promote manufacturing improvement. (2) Abandon boiling and switch to sun drying to reduce salt production costs. (3) Improve the technology of coarse salt manufacturing to improve the quality of group salt. (4) Promote refined salt to seek material progress.</p>
<p>Banning Inferior Salt</p>
<p>In addition to sea salt, pond salt, and well salt, China's salt production also includes gypsum salt, saltpeter salt, and local salt. Among them, local saltpeter and local salt are not only produced in a very wide area, but also extremely scattered. The sodium chloride content of the salt is mostly below 60%. Using it as edible salt is not only harmful to hygiene but also infringes on national taxes. Therefore, it is often strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>Recent Rectification Status</p>
<p>In addition to improving salt field production, the Salt Affairs Administration is also striving to improve the lives of salt farmers and balance tax rates, providing salt farmer loans, and providing relief to salt farmers' livelihoods. It is reported that the Changlu and Lianghuai salt fields are about to complete matters such as building salt pits and improving quality, and the new salt law may be implemented first. The salt fields in Zhejiang, Shandong, Fujian, Guangdong, and other places are currently in a period of active rectification. It is expected that the nationwide implementation of the new salt law, on-site tax collection, and free trade will not be far off.</p>

<h3>Agreed Measures for Banning Opium in Concession Areas Scheduled for Joint Implementation in August, Our Side in Charge of Supervision and Concession Areas Responsible for Implementation, General Reporting Deadline, and Offenders to be Punished According to Law</h3>
<p>Dagong News Agency reports that in order to promote the work of banning opium and drugs in concession areas, the government's Standing Committee has, through the military commission's special envoy Ma Liang, in conjunction with Mayor Wu, obtained concrete approaches after consulting with the concession authorities based on the regulations stipulated by the central government. Implementation is scheduled to begin on August 10. The special envoy's office will continue to work to supervise the concession area's opium ban. Dagong News Agency's reporter has learned the details as follows:</p>
<p>Implementing the Opium Ban in Concession Areas After the military commission issued an order to the Shanghai-based special envoy's office and the municipal government to implement measures to ban opium and drugs in concession areas, Special Envoy Ma Liang and Mayor Wu discussed the steps for implementing the ban. The concession authorities have now expressed their support for our side's agreed measures to ban opium. The Municipal Council and the Board of Directors are the implementing agencies, the courts are the punishing agencies, and the special envoy's office and the municipal government are the supervising agencies. The registration of opium users is handled by the police stations in each district, and the Municipal Council will designate hospitals within the concession to be responsible for sending opium users to quit opium. The administrative procedures are the same as those handled by the Municipal Public Security Bureau. However, the supervisory agencies have the power of supervision and consultation over the opium ban in the concession areas and will cooperate in the process. As for the date for completely eliminating opium and drugs, it will be completely eradicated within the time limit stipulated by our central authorities. It was originally planned to jointly establish an opium ban agency in the concession areas, but because the concession authorities could not agree, the matter has been temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>Starting Next Month After repeated consultations between the two parties, the measures for implementing the opium ban in the concession areas have achieved a solution. The competent authorities are submitting these agreed measures to the Opium Ban General Association and the General Supervision Department for review. If there are no changes, it has been decided that implementation will begin on August 10. The first step is to carry out registration and licensing. The second step is to carry out reporting. The third step is to enforce compulsory rehabilitation. When the implementation period begins, a joint notice will be issued by the municipal government, the special envoy's office, the Municipal Council, and the Board of Directors to inform the public.</p>
<p>Attention Opium Users Since the Municipal Public Security Bureau, in compliance with the order of the military commission's General Supervision Department, began the city-wide general reporting work on May 10, there are only ten days left until the deadline of August 10 as stipulated. During the reporting period, more than 12,000 opium users have registered retroactively. After the end of the general reporting work, if unregistered opium users or those who traffic, produce, or sell drugs are found, they will be severely punished according to law.</p>
<h3>Guo Bingwen Speaks on International Trade</h3>
<p>Opinions After the Investigation</p>
<p>A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency interviewed Guo Bingwen, Director of the International Trade Bureau, yesterday to inquire about the international trade situation after his investigation abroad. According to him, the report in the newspaper (note that this newspaper did not publish it yesterday) about the international trade sections of my speech at the local association contained many inaccuracies. He agreed to give a summary of the original manuscript of his speech at that time, as follows: In addition to investigating international trade, I also studied the silver issue in the United States during this trip. It was found that after the implementation of the silver bill in the United States, the facts were completely opposite to its ideals. Therefore, even those who supported the silver policy changed their attitudes. The government was in a dilemma and thought about jointly discussing the matter with silver-producing and silver-using countries, and invited our country to participate. After seven weeks of discussion, our side agreed to increase the silver shake-off, and the US side used US dollars to exchange for Chinese silver, so that our country's new currency, which has tended to stabilize, is even more consolidated, and the international finance is gradually stabilized as a result. Moreover, the recession in the United States has gradually disappeared, and there is hope for further progress in trade between China and the United States. As for the state of our country's foreign trade, it can be divided into three points: one is handicrafts, one is major agricultural products, and one is manufactured goods. Handicrafts have always been welcomed by Europeans and Americans, but because they have adhered to old methods for decades and have failed to cater to the psychology of foreigners, their business is declining and there is already a phenomenon of being replaced by others. As far as I know, Chinese silk used to account for 50% of the total imports to the United States, but it gradually decreased due to Japanese silk competition. Last year, it only accounted for 2%. Fifty years ago, tea accounted for 90% of the total imports to the United States, but last year it dropped to 6% due to competition from Indian and Japanese tea. However, tung oil, due to the surge in demand, the amount exported to the United States last year, considering only the paint industry, was worth more than 30 million yuan. However, due to its impure quality, unstable output, and fluctuating prices, the US Department of Commerce and the Tung Oil Association have advocated planting tung trees, and there are already products that are not inferior to Chinese products. South America, Africa, the Soviet Union, and British colonies are also encouraging planting tung trees, which will inevitably affect the sales of tung oil in our country in the future. Therefore, Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry has recently planned to establish a vegetable oil refining plant, and also intends to improve the production and sales methods of silk, tea, and so on, and gradually promote them. It is not difficult to restore sales. Domestically produced manufactured goods have considerable strength in Nanyang, Singapore, and other places, but the promotion has not been effective, and domestic manufacturers do not have sound organizations. For example, the silk fabrics of the Meiya Factory and domestically produced light bulbs and electric fans all have the potential for promotion, but they cannot be promoted due to the lack of places to buy them. The Philippines and other places also have the same situation. I hope that the colleagues of this association and domestic manufacturers will pay attention to it. In short, for foreign trade, (1) the goods should be of high quality and strive for progress, and standardization is necessary. (2) The price should be low, so that it can compete with other similar goods in the market. (3) A three-legged sound sales organization. (4) Financial institutions should provide exporters with financial convenience. (5) The government should bear greater advocacy and guidance, such as the Trade Bureau established by the US government, which has 25 branch offices in the country, 54 cooperative institutions, and 33 commercial counselors and commissioners stationed abroad. It also has an import and export industry bank, which specializes in lending for foreign trade. The lending period is usually one to five years, and it can be extended in special circumstances. The United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, and other countries have even more loan insurance institutions for trade, and many other countries have followed suit, which can all be learned from our country. In addition, there are many ways to restrict imports and encourage exports, such as implementing protective tariffs, controlling foreign exchange, revising reciprocal commercial treaties, international clearing agreements, and commodity exchanges, which can also be studied by our country and selectively implemented.</p>

<h3>Arnold Praises Yu Qiaqing, The Board of Directors of the Municipal Council Decides to Change the Street Name</h3>
<p>The proposal to rename a street to commemorate Yu Qiaqing, a prominent businessman and Chinese member of the Public Concession Board, was initiated by the Citizens' Federation and submitted to the Municipal Council for approval. Later, it was found that there was more than one street that could be renamed, such as Haining Road and Ningbo Road, which were once considered. As a result of recent contacts between the parties, it was decided to rename Tibet Road to Yu Qiaqing Road. At the last meeting of the Municipal Council Board of Directors before the summer recess, the matter was temporarily raised for a vote by Director-General Arnold, and it was unanimously approved to rename Tibet Road to Yu Qiaqing Road. When Arnold made the proposal, he greatly praised Yu's life, his service to the community, his support for the Public Concession administration, and his contribution to promoting friendship between China and foreign countries. He said that Yu was not only the leader of the Chinese Board, but his intelligence and experience were sufficient to be the cornerstone of the Concession's administrative organs. Renaming Tibet Road to Yu Qiaqing Road to commemorate him forever is truly a great story. Furthermore, since Tibet Road has been renamed Yu Qiaqing Road, the section of North Tibet Road should be renamed Tibet Road to maintain the original name.</p>

We have learned that the Board of Directors of the Municipal Council has approved the renaming of Tibet Road, the widest road in the central district of the Public Concession, to Yu Qiaqing Road. Considering that Mr. Qiaqing is highly respected, there should be a grand celebration for this renaming of Tibet Road to Yu Qiaqing Road.

<h3>Provincial Government Orders Each County to Report on Handling Cooperative Affairs</h3>

<h3>Ministry of Communications Attaches Importance to Navigation Safety and Rectifies Ship Radios</h3>
<p>Formulates Five Rectification Measures and Orders All Merchant Ships to Comply</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications, in view of the fact that the ship radio equipment established by various Chinese merchant ships is simple and poorly maintained, resulting in reduced communication efficiency, which is of great importance to navigation safety, now the Ministry has formulated five rectification measures to improve the communication efficiency of various ship radios. The details are as follows: (1) When each Chinese merchant ship equipped with a ship radio arrives in Shanghai, the captain or his agent shall immediately report in writing to the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau, which shall notify the Shanghai International Radio Station to select an engineer or technician to go for inspection. (2) When the International Radio Station's technician inspects the ship's radio, he shall pay attention to the following points: A. Whether the transmitting and receiving equipment is maintained perfectly; B. Whether the power supply equipment is suitable; C. Whether the transmitting frequency is accurate; D. Whether the antenna method and height and length are appropriate; E. Whether there is a spare transceiver and automatic alarm; F. Whether the battery is maintained perfectly; G. Whether the radio room location and equipment are appropriate; H. Whether the radio station and radio officer have licenses and how many radio officers there are; I. Whether the radio compass is accurate; J. Other matters related to communication efficiency. (3) After the International Radio Station's inspector completes the inspection, he shall immediately fill out four copies of the inspection report, one copy shall be submitted to the Ministry of Communications for verification, one copy shall be sent to the Maritime Affairs Bureau for record, one copy shall be given to the captain or his agent for reference, and one copy shall be kept by the radio station.

(5) After the ship's radio has been improved, the Maritime Affairs Bureau shall be immediately notified in writing, and the Bureau shall notify the International Radio Station to send personnel to re-inspect it. If any discrepancies are still found, the measures stipulated in Article 4 shall be followed.</p>
<h3>Hua Yang Yi Zhen Hui Reports on the Tragic Situation of the Flood in Shanghang</h3>
<p>The Hua Yang Yi Zhen Hui at No. 97 Renji Road received a letter from the Shanghang County Flood Relief Association in Fujian Province, which is copied below, "Alas, Heaven has brought disaster to the people of Hang, causing successive catastrophes. After the Red bandits, they have suffered from a flood. They are scattered and displaced, and it is shocking and heartbreaking. According to reports from various districts in the county, since the middle of May this year, it has been raining heavily and continuously. Mountain floods have risen sharply everywhere, overflowing and flooding. The fields and crops are all submerged, and the waterway in the Tingjiang River basin is blocked. It has been more than ten days, and the disaster is becoming more and more urgent, and the disaster is becoming more and more apparent. The most serious disaster is in the Dayang Dam, Xiaxia Suqian and other villages in the eastern district, and the Gutian Qiufang Zhongcun Sukeng Xiadaohu area in the northern district. Many houses and livestock have been washed away, and the fields and seedlings have been turned into gravel. The bridges and roads along the river have been completely destroyed, with losses of no less than tens of thousands of yuan. The most tragic thing is that all the shops in the Dayang Dam market were washed away by the flood. In Jinghuang Village, there were only two stoves for seventy households, and corpses covered the river for days without ceasing. The Dayang Dam is located in the upper reaches of the Hangdong River and has never suffered from floods before. This time, the disaster is particularly serious, so the losses in the lower reaches can be imagined. The number of buildings that were washed away, such as the Tabamu Bridge, cannot be built for less than three or four thousand gold, and other losses are countless. The most painful and pitiful thing is that the people in the disaster area, excluding those who were buried in the bellies of fish, are displaced and have nothing to live on. They are disheveled and barefoot, living in the open air, supporting the old and carrying the young, begging in other villages, crying for help, and lamenting everywhere. It is not necessary to draw Zheng Xia's picture, it is enough to make those who hear it sad. Moreover, the price of rice in this county is as precious as pearls due to the impact of the flood, and the rice fields in the disaster area have been completely destroyed and there is no harvest. If no measures are taken to provide relief, then tens of thousands of disaster victims will not only avoid being killed on the road, but will also die of starvation in autumn and winter. The colleagues were heartbroken by what they saw, so they organized a relief association to plan and manage the relief efforts. They have already submitted a request to the government to allocate funds for relief. However, it is difficult to expect a living fish from a distant river, and at a time when public funds are extremely tight, whether the government can allocate as much relief as possible is still a guess. In order to seek quick results, we have to recommend enthusiastic fellow villagers from this county and various places abroad to sponsor fundraising and directly appeal to charitable figures at home and abroad to ask for help. It is said that natural disasters occur everywhere, and it is also said that everyone likes to do good, who is not as good as me? We humbly ask benevolent gentlemen to have a compassionate heart and to accomplish a broad and generous act, generously donating money to provide relief, so that those who receive the relief will not only bathe in the grace of rebirth, but the entire people of Hangzhou will also pay tribute to the boundless gift."</p>

The institute had previously submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to forward a letter to the Chinese Embassy in Japan, or to instruct the Commercial Counselor in Japan to send a letter to the Tokyo Engineering and Political Association and other places to introduce him to visit. It is reported that Mr. Jin has scheduled to come to Shanghai from Beijing around the day of next month, transfer to a ship to Japan. The itinerary is planned to first go to Osaka, and then to Tokyo. The investigation period is tentatively set for two months. If it is not enough, it may be extended.</p>

<p>Opening Ceremony</p>
<p>At 2 p.m., the bell rang to start the meeting. After the usual ceremonies, Chairman Wang Xiaolai reported on the purpose of the meeting, stating that promoting national goods is the key to saving the country today. There are national goods exhibitions in all directions in Shanghai, which proves that the Chinese people recognize the importance of promoting national goods. However, in the most prosperous central area of the Special District, there has been no such event before. This is because the Special District is a foreign concession, and it is more difficult to carry out various activities. Today, the association is fighting in adversity and is able to open today, which is undoubtedly good news in the midst of the promotion of national goods. In the future, we hope that all manufacturers will work hard to promote national goods, so as to plug the loopholes to the outside world, solve the entire national economy, and provide great help to the country. Subsequently, Wang Jiean of the Chinese National Goods Maintenance Association, and Zhang Yichen, Liu Zhongying, Jiang Shangen of the Municipal Joint Association delivered speeches one after another. Finally, Zhou Zhaolin, General Affairs of the Conference, reported on the preparations.</p>

<h3>Rice Pile Collapses and Injures Many People, Shop Assistants and Passers-by Were Also Injured, None Seriously, and Were Bandaged and Discharged from the Hospital</h3>
<p>The Yichengyuan Grain Store at the intersection of Xinjiang Road and Guoqing Road, due to a large batch of machine-milled rice transported from other places the previous evening (the 23rd), the shop assistants Yang Jinsheng and others piled it up overnight in the corridor along the door outside the counter in the store. It was not finished until after 8 p.m. At that time, a loud noise was suddenly heard. Because the rice pile was piled too high, the signboard could not withstand it and collapsed towards the road. At that time, there were a dozen children from Jiangbei gathered along the door of the store, sweeping up the remaining rice. Several of them were injured because they could not avoid it. A passer-by was also injured in the left leg. Afterwards, the shop assistants immediately called an ambulance and sent the injured people to the Hongguang Red Cross Hospital. Because the injuries were minor, they were bandaged and then sent to the Menggu Road Police Station in the same car. After questioning, they were released. The names of the injured people at the time are copied below: (1) Sun Youcai (28 years old), injured in the left leg; (2) Zhou Guisheng (9 years old), injured in the face; (3) Xu Chengfeng (15 years old), injured in the leg; (4) Xu Chenglong (9 years old), injured in the face; (5) Wu Xiaowuzi (5 years old), injured in the face; (6) Yang Jinsheng (shop assistant of the rice store), injured in the face.</p>
<h3>Song Xu Tortures Maid, Sentenced to Six Months</h3>
<p>Song Xu (28 years old), a Ningbo woman from No. 28 Wuzhou Road, because she had no children, bought a 10-year-old girl, Lin Di, as an adopted daughter in her hometown for dozens of yuan in February last year.

The girl cried often due to various abuses, and the neighbors all heard it. The day before yesterday at noon, she severely beat the girl again and did not give her food. She wailed at the door. After learning the information from neighbor Wang Songyue, he reported it to the Jiaxing Road Police Station, which sent detective Cao Jinbiao to bring the woman and the girl to the police station. The girl was sent to the Jiliang Institute. Yesterday morning, she was escorted to the First Special Court. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Public Concession, explained the case and asked for investigation. Then, Wang Songyue and the girl testified about what happened. When asked about the defendant, she was evasive. Judge Zhong Qing sentenced Song Xu to six months of imprisonment as a warning. Lin Di did not want to go home and was kept in the Jiliang Institute.</p>

<p>Whenever laymen see monks, they bow and pay their respects with reverence and sincerity. Even after a long time, they do not slack off. Their respect for Buddhist disciples is truly incomparable to our country. The Tripitaka presented by the group to that country is now enshrined in the Buddhist Library of that temple. Those who go to see it are all happy and praise it. The group is now living in a school run by a Buddhist organization and is now engaged in</p>
<p>Studying Sanskrit</p>
<p>Pali, etc. The coursework is extremely busy. After a month, they will be ordained as monks. The local climate is not too hot, with the daily temperature between 80 and 90 degrees. Moreover, there is greenery everywhere, with coconut trees and banana trees planted everywhere. The scenery is very beautiful and is indeed a holy place to live and study Buddhism.</p>
<h3>Shanghai First Special District Court Plans to Establish a Notary Office, Scheduled to Open on August 1</h3>
<p>The Provisional Rules for Notarization were previously promulgated by the Judicial Yuan in July last year. It is reported that the Shanghai First Special District Court has been ordered to establish a Notary Office to handle notarization affairs. It is currently preparing and is scheduled to be officially established on August 1. The Ministry of Justice has designated a judge from the court to specialize in notarization affairs, and there are several court clerks to assist in handling. In the future, parties can request notarization for legal acts or other facts concerning private rights, or for private documents that have been made, and may appoint an agent to do so. Copies of notarized documents and authenticated private documents are not subject to loss. In the event of litigation, they can be submitted for reference at any time or requested by the court for review. Public documents created at the Notary Office can avoid problems arising when they are cited as evidence due to non-compliance with the form. (However, if a party knows that a matter is false and requests notarization or authentication that is sufficient to harm the rights of others, he shall be liable for criminal liability.) Moreover, according to Article 11 of the Provisional Rules for Notarization, a notarized document stating the name of the direct enforcement can be obtained without litigation procedures, eliminating many disputes. It is reported that the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Provisional Rules for Notarization and the Rules for Notarization Fees, etc., are currently being printed urgently to prepare for people to ask for them.</p>

<h3>Inspection of Tongyi Company's Inventory Finds No Keys; Warehouse Manager Arrested; Wanted Warehouse Manager Liu Zikang Spotted and Apprehended</h3>
<p>After the Tongyi Trust Company declared bankruptcy, its responsible parties have been subject to criminal lawsuits filed by various creditors. Last Saturday, Judge Zhong Qing of the First Special District Court reopened the trial and decided that lawyers for both parties, along with the company's liquidators, would inspect the account books and inventory of Tongyi Trust Company on Beijing Road under the supervision of the court for verification. The afternoon before yesterday, relevant personnel arrived at the company, but were unable to find the keys to the vault, making it impossible to verify the inventory. At that moment, Liu Zikang, the company's warehouse manager who was also being sued, was spotted at the scene. The crowd questioned Liu and asked him to hand over the keys. Liu claimed that the keys had been taken by Chairman and Manager Huang Suchu, making it impossible to comply. When asked about Huang's whereabouts, he claimed ignorance. Le Junwei, a lawyer representing a creditor, pointed out that Liu had been jointly ordered for arrest along with Huang Suchu by the court.

The court then approved the detention of Liu Zikang pending a rescheduled hearing.</p>
<h3>College Student and Dance Hostess Commit Adultery; Wife Reports and Apprehends Them; Zhang Xipi Ignores Old Affection and Becomes Infatuated with Dance Partner; Qian Wenying Once Went to the Yangzi Dance Hall to Negotiate; Dance Hostess Jiang Ailing Directly Admits to Relationship with Zhang</h3>
<p>Zhang Xipi, a 25-year-old from Hangzhou, graduated from Great China University last year. While Zhang was studying at the university, he had a relationship with Qian Wenying (also known as Zhang Qian, a 24-year-old from Songjiang), a female student at the same school. They engaged in intimate relations on multiple occasions, resulting in Qian becoming pregnant. At that time, their love reached a boiling point, so after graduating last summer, they formally engaged in Songjiang on July 30, introduced by Huang Chuqiu and Lin Zhai'ai. The following day, they held a wedding ceremony and then came to Shanghai, renting a house at 150 Pingmin Lane, Hudong, to live together. In October, Qian Wenying</p>
<p>went into labor</p>
<p>and gave birth to a daughter. Unexpectedly, Zhang Xipi's attitude suddenly changed, and he often stayed out all night, causing Qian Wenying to become suspicious and begin investigating. Recently, she discovered that her husband had an inextricable relationship with Ailing (also known as Li Xingxian, a 16-year-old from Wuxi), a dance hostess at the Yangzi Dance Hall. On the afternoon of the 11th of this month, she secretly went to Yangzi to investigate, and indeed saw her husband Zhang Xipi</p>
<p>embracing and dancing</p>
<p>with Jiang Ailing in a very intimate manner. After they finished dancing, she went forward to negotiate. Zhang, concerned about his reputation, had an argument with his wife, which then escalated into physical violence. Qian Wenying left in anger, but Zhang continued his ways, staying out all night and using the alias Wang Mingfa to commit adultery with Jiang in room 166 of the Sutai Hotel on Fuzhou Road for several nights. Qian learned of this and reported it to the Lao Zha Police Station around 10 p.m. the night before last. Detective Lang Jintang and Constable Lu Rongting were dispatched to the Sutai Hotel, where they found Zhang and Jiang</p>
<p>in the same bed.</p>
<p>They were taken to the police station and detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police Lawyer Jiang Baolian charged the two defendants with adultery under Article 239 of the Criminal Law and presented the case, requesting a rescheduled hearing. Qian Wenying then testified that she met Zhang Xipi while studying at Great China University and they began a relationship. They were engaged in Songjiang on July 30 last year and</p>
<p>held a wedding ceremony</p>
<p>the following day. In October, she gave birth to a daughter and they lived together at 150 Pingmin Lane, Qimei Road. Recently, her husband has been staying out all night,</p>
<p>and after investigating, I found out that he was renting a room with Jiang Ailing, a dance hostess at Yangzi. I went to investigate on the 11th of this month and saw my husband dancing with Jiang. I advised him to go home, but Jiang instigated my husband to beat me, causing my nose and mouth to bleed. Yesterday, I discovered that my husband and Jiang were living together in the</p>
<p>Sutai Hotel,</p>
<p>so I reported the case to the police. I now request that the two defendants be brought to justice and have hired lawyer Fan Gang to file a civil suit as an attachment. Zhang Xipi denied and said that he only had a cohabitating relationship with Qian Wenying. Although they were engaged, they were not married. He admitted to committing adultery with Li Xingxian (also known as Jiang Ailing). Jiang Ailing testified that she worked as a dance hostess at the</p>
<p>Yangzi Dance Hall</p>
<p>and met Zhang a month ago. Their first physical encounter was at the Oriental Hotel. This time, they lived together in the Sutai Hotel for five or six days, but she claimed she did not know that Zhang was a married man. Judge Zhan Liangce reviewed the testimonies and ordered both defendants to post bail of 500 yuan each. The case was rescheduled for another seven days, and the court advised both plaintiffs and defendants to attempt reconciliation during the rescheduled period.</p>

<h3>Vagrant Assault and Murder of Policeman Case at Shanghai Vagrant Labor Camp: Sentencing Set for the 28th</h3>
<p>Vagrants Gao Fuxiang, Pan Heshou, Hong Jianfu, and others from the Caohejing Vagrant Labor Camp, along with fugitives Yao Benren, Gao Yongling, Wu Ruilin, and others, conspired to escape and assaulted and killed guard Lu Yecai. Another guard noticed this and quickly summoned other guards to surround and arrest Gao Fuxiang, Pan Heshou, and Hong Jianfu. Yao Benren, Gao Yongling, Wu Ruilin, and others escaped. They were handed over to the Mountain District Court for investigation and prosecution for murder under Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. After repeated review by Judge Zhao Yongzhou, another continued hearing was held at 10 a.m. yesterday. Defendants Gao Fuxiang and Pan Heshou confessed to the joint assault but claimed that it was Yao Benren and others who initiated the escape due to unbearable suffering in the labor camp, and they merely echoed their sentiments. However, Hong Jianfu claimed that he voluntarily entered the camp to learn a skill, did not want to escape, and therefore was not part of the conspiracy. He stated that he did not stop the others at the time out of fear of violence, but he did not escape afterward, which could serve as proof. At this point, the prosecutor presented his arguments, stating that the defendants had confessed and that the murder of the guard occurred in their room, so it was determined that there was evidence of their guilt and requested that they be convicted.

<h3>Public Concession Has Over 40,000 Rickshaw Pullers; Crackdown on Unlicensed Rickshaws Intensified</h3>
<p>According to the recent report of the Rickshaw Affairs Committee of the Public Works Department, the number of rickshaw pullers in the Public Concession who have renewed their licenses is 36,045. In addition, there are 4,992 newly licensed pullers. Therefore, the authorities believe that the current number of pullers is sufficient to meet the needs of the rickshaw industry. The police have been entrusted to make every effort to ensure that all rickshaw pullers in the city have licenses and wear armbands. Furthermore, there are now 1,921 new-style rickshaws on the market, providing passengers with greater comfort than before.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of rickshaw owners overcharging rent, another case occurred in June. However, the reporting puller was absent from the negotiations. After investigation, it was discovered that the rickshaw owner had bribed them to be absent. Later, the pullers reported to the Vehicle Affairs Committee again because the rickshaw owner did not fulfill his previous promises, but the Vehicle Affairs Committee rejected the report. In addition to issuing a stern warning to the rickshaw owner, a judgment was not made for the time being. However, recently, the licenses of four rickshaw owners were revoked for overcharging rent, which has greatly helped to standardize rickshaw rentals.</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding private rickshaws, there are so-called unlicensed chartered rickshaws in the city. Although the police authorities have severely cracked down on them, they have not been completely eliminated. This matter was recently discussed again by the Special Rickshaw Committee, which stated that the police should be responsible for intensifying investigations and that the true purpose of those who obtain private rickshaw licenses must be determined. If any violations occur, the rickshaw owner should be made aware of their responsibilities. If a rickshaw puller violates the regulations twice, their license will be permanently revoked.</p>

<h3>French Concession Reregisters Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners; Traditional Chinese Medicine Organizations Oppose</h3>
<p>Sending Letters Requesting Assistance</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese medicine practitioners practicing in Shanghai have been examined and qualified by the Municipal Health Bureau and issued licenses. However, those residing in the special zone must register with the authorities again. The Second Special District, after agreeing with the Traditional Chinese Medicine Organization in 1931, determined that registration would be valid for life. Unexpectedly, the "Regulations for Managing the Practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine" were recently promulgated, changing the validity period to five years and increasing the registration fee from two yuan to five yuan. There are also items such as health donations and investigation fees. A slight delay will result in fines. As a result, traditional Chinese medicine practitioners in the district have reported to the Shanghai Traditional Chinese Medicine Association, the Shanghai Traditional Chinese Medicine Society, the Chinese Traditional Chinese Medicine Society, and the Shenzhou Traditional Chinese Medicine Society, requesting negotiations to abolish the new regulations and improve treatment. The associations have also jointly discussed and decided to negotiate with the French authorities, and have jointly sent letters to the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, the French Concession Board of Directors, the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Second Special District, and Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Lu Bohong, Qi Yunqing, Zhang Jixian, Qian Xinzhi, etc., requesting assistance, and have published notices in the newspaper to members, reporting the situation. The original letters to the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, the French Concession Board of Directors, and the Chinese Directors of the Taxpayers' Association are recorded as follows: "Respected Sirs, Our associations have repeatedly received complaints from members residing in the Second Special District of this city, stating that the French Board of Works recently promulgated the "Regulations for Managing the Practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine" under Order No. 58 of the French Consul General, requiring all traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, regardless of whether they have registered or not, to reregister in accordance with the regulations. Not only has the fee doubled, but also the procedures have become cumbersome. Other items such as health donations and investigation fees will be fined for a slight delay. During normal inspections, foreign translators often arrive with aggressive postures, making it difficult for freelance professionals to endure oppression. The cost of living is high, making it difficult to bear the burden. We request negotiations and assistance to abolish the new regulations and improve treatment, etc." They have come to the association one after another for the same reason. According to the members, they are all traditional Chinese medicine practitioners who have been formally registered by your bureau (Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau), reside in the Second Special District, and have already paid business taxes (that is, a health donation of two yuan per year). They should not be subject to other forced restrictions. (Doctor registration in the First Special District is at the discretion of the doctors.) In 1931, when the French Concession first implemented doctor registration, our associations negotiated, and as a result, the French authorities solemnly announced that after one registration, it would be valid for life. Only then did everyone endure and make concessions and register in accordance with the regulations. However, not long after, they went back on their word and showed no integrity. Suddenly, the "Regulations for Managing the Practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine" were promulgated, not only changing the term from life to five years and increasing the fee from two yuan to five yuan, but also increasing the burden that traditional Chinese medicine practitioners should not bear, such as health donations and investigation fees, and depriving the freedom of the traditional Chinese medicine profession in every way possible. For the sake of maintaining the business of our members, we have been entrusted by the majority and have no choice but to make the following appeals on their behalf: (1) The doctor registration held by the French Concession in 1930 generally refers to Western medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, dentistry, and veterinary medicine. Today, it only concerns our traditional Chinese medicine practitioners. It is not called the Traditional Chinese Medicine Registration Regulations, but the Regulations for Managing the Practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Looking at the name, its meaning is clear. Although the special zone is called a concession, there is still freedom of occupation. Today, only traditional Chinese medicine practitioners residing in the French Concession, in addition to being governed by their own government, must also bear the dual obligations of the French Concession (in addition to business tax and health donations, there is now a registration fee every five years, hence the dual obligation). Is it fair? (2) The new regulations state that when registering, in addition to the business license of the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau as proof, proof of date of birth, nationality, and place of origin is also required (Item 1 of Article 2). This proof is naturally not available to Chinese people, will it not cause difficulties during registration? This is also one of the cumbersome procedures. (3) Article 11 of the new regulations states that "the business of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners should be limited to the behavior within the scope of their industry as usual," while Article 12 has the harsh restriction that "traditional Chinese medicine practitioners must not prepare or sell medicines or partner with pharmacists or traditional Chinese medicine merchants without special permission." Will not the commonly used medicines of surgeons, injury departments, and internal medicine departments be subject to unnecessary restrictions and unable to carry out their business? The prohibition of partnership is a deprivation of the freedom of business, which is not found in any rule of law. (4) Article 14 of the new regulations states that "traditional Chinese medicine practitioners must not move their clinics without prior notification to the Director of the Health Department of the French Board of Works." The original intention of this provision is not known, but when this article is implemented, it will inevitably cause many disputes and difficulties. This provision is difficult to comply with. (5) The application form for registration in Article 2 must be paid for, and the amount of donations in Article 8 and the donations for extension in Article 10 are not specified. It was originally intended to be a one-time lifetime, but now it is changed to once every five years. However, how much gold will each person have to bear in these five years? In this time of economic depression and the decline of all industries, it is unbearable. (6) Article 10 of the new regulations, which states that "the validity period of the business license is five years," clearly means that it must be reregistered every five years. Judging from the statement "limited to the donation of ...", it can be subtly implied that the purpose is entirely to collect money. The profession of traditional Chinese medicine is inherently free, and the nature of traditional Chinese medicine is close to charity. In terms of health administration, it is naturally beneficial and harmless. Why should traditional Chinese medicine practitioners residing in the French Concession be subject to such heavy restrictions and burdens? If the French authorities are not imposing a ban in disguise, it is discriminating against traditional Chinese medicine. In short, the promulgation of the new regulations is neither beneficial in law nor in sentiment. All our traditional Chinese medicine practitioners cannot bear it. We have specifically made this statement and implore your bureau to fight for justice and forward it to the French Concession Board of Directors. (Taxpayers' Association) Your esteemed association advocates fairness and forwards it to the Board of Directors of (the Board of Directors) Your esteemed board quickly complies with public opinion, sympathizes with the difficulties, withdraws the order, and restores trust in accordance with past practices. We cannot but wait for orders with the utmost urgency."</p>

According to the company's management, this issue has long been a concern for the company, and they have hired experts to conduct various experiments to reduce smoke. However, due to the unique circumstances of this area, it is difficult to achieve complete success in the short term. Nevertheless, they will continue to make efforts to achieve a satisfactory outcome. Recently, the Municipal Council has repeatedly negotiated with the company's management, urging them to make every effort to eliminate smoke emissions. The Municipal Council's departments have also proposed several measures, which the power company has sympathetically accepted. However, due to economic considerations, they are not planning to invest heavily in other remedial work until the current experimental results are fully confirmed. Recently, the Municipal Council's Defense Committee convened a meeting, inviting company representatives to discuss this issue. The company provided a very detailed report on the progress of recent remedial work. The committee resolved to urge the company management to expedite the implementation of the measures they have outlined and to submit regular reports to the Municipal Council on the progress and effectiveness of these measures. The Works Department will also be responsible for regular inspections. The ongoing experiments are expected to be completed by the end of November, at which time the Works Department will submit an inspection report. The goal is to completely eliminate black smoke emissions within a year and a half. Regarding the raising of the chimneys, opinions are divided on its effectiveness. However, in the future, when new plants are built, the chimneys should be higher than the existing ones. The currently decided remedial measures will still be implemented to ensure their effectiveness. It is said that the above measures have all been approved by the Municipal Council's Board of Directors.</p>

<h3>Dispute Over Building Construction in Saint Anna - Civil Suit Lost All Three Trials - Wang Xinhe Sues the Construction Company Again on Criminal Charges - Defendant Says Wang Tried to Deny the Construction Cost, Hence the Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Chang Sheng Construction Company, located at 33 Sichuan Road, contracted to build the Saint Anna Ballroom on Xieqiao Road. After its completion, Wang Xinhe, the owner of the ballroom, found that the construction cost claimed by Chang Sheng was too different from the original agreed amount, and a lawsuit ensued. After the appraisal process by the Municipal Council's Works Bureau, the First Special District Court ruled that Wang Xinhe should repay Chang Sheng over 30,000 yuan. Wang was not satisfied and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court and the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court then remanded the case to the Second Branch of the High Court for a retrial. Recently, the judgment was again in favor of Chang Sheng, and execution was approved. However, Wang Xinhe, seeing that the civil lawsuit had been repeatedly lost and was difficult to salvage, now opened another path, filing a criminal self-accusation against He Jingdi, Sun Weiming, and Jiang Xinian, the responsible persons of Chang Sheng, for fraud. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhong of the First Special Court opened a hearing. Defendant Jiang Xinian was out of Shanghai on business, and only He and Sun appeared. The plaintiff, Wang Xinhe, also did not appear in person, but was represented by Lawyer Jiang Pingfan, who stated the intention of the prosecution, saying that recently it was discovered that three parts of the project undertaken by the defendant had been cut corners, especially the veranda, which was not strong and would easily collapse after prolonged wind and rain, which was extremely dangerous. The materials used were mostly inferior goods and did not match the original agreement, so they should be held responsible for fraud. He requested an inspection and requested that the defendants be punished, etc. When questioned, defendants He and Sun stated that the plaintiff tried to deny the construction cost and did not hesitate to repeatedly file lawsuits. Lawyer Yan Yu was also hired to defend, arguing that the plaintiff had actually lost the civil suit and saw that the court had announced provisional execution, so he filed this lawsuit to resist it. He described the three trials of the civil case in detail. Judge Zhong then ordered an adjournment for further questioning.</p>

<h3>Recent Trends in Central Educational Administration: Higher Education Focuses on Practical Subjects with Marked Success; Improving Secondary Schools, Implementing Compulsory Education, and Promoting Private Schools</h3>
<p>(Nanjing Special Dispatch) In the past three years, the Ministry of Education has made many reforms to education at all levels. The facts are scattered in various newspapers, but Minister Wang Shijie has devoted himself to hard work and rarely expresses his opinions on educational administration to reporters. Senior officials in the ministry also follow this principle, and rarely provide systematic explanations of administrative matters. As the 24th year has ended and the 25th year has begun, the reporter will provide a systematic description of the recent trends in central educational administration.</p>
<p>In terms of higher education, the policy in recent years has been to narrow the scope and enrich the content, not to pursue quantitative development, but to improve the quality. Efforts are made to avoid extravagance and decoration and to focus on pragmatism. In recent years, the merging of repetitive departments and the improvement of school content have gradually achieved results. Limiting liberal arts and focusing on practical subjects have yielded obvious results. According to statistics released by the Ministry of Education, the number of graduates in practical subjects has increased by 3%, and the number of graduates in liberal arts has decreased by 3%. Freshmen in practical subjects accounted for 45% last year and jumped to 51% this year. In the past, there were more liberal arts students than practical subjects, but now practical subjects exceed liberal arts. The great effect can be seen. The amount of subsidies for private colleges and universities is also mostly used in practical subjects, and private schools benefit a lot. Students studying abroad at public expense are overwhelmingly in practical subjects. In addition to continuing the original policy, the development of higher education in the border areas is gradually being planned, such as the preparation for the establishment of National Northwest University and the subsidies for Guangxi and Yunnan Universities, which are clear examples. In addition, there is also the issue of paying attention to the career paths of university graduates. Last year, an Academic Work Advisory Office was established jointly with the National Economic Commission, and this year, a University Graduate Employment Training Class has been organized. The trend of higher education administration, in terms of nature, has gradually shifted from quantitative expansion to qualitative improvement; in terms of content, it has gradually shifted from distorted development to rational enrichment; in terms of region, it has gradually shifted from the development of cities and inland areas to the development of border areas; in terms of effectiveness, it has gradually shifted from talent cultivation to talent utilization.</p>
<p>In terms of general education, the major reforms in recent years have been the separation of secondary schools and normal schools, the grouping of secondary school curricula, and the active expansion of vocational education and compulsory education. In the past, secondary schools and normal schools were a mixed system, with normal departments established in senior high schools. However, due to the mixed establishment of secondary schools and normal schools, there were more disadvantages than advantages, so there was a provision for separate establishment. At present, it cannot be handled by private individuals to avoid abuses. Recently, the Ministry of Education has also established a special department in the administration to handle normal education matters. The senior high school curriculum originally had no grouping requirements, but since the implementation of the curriculum standards, the need for grouping has gradually been felt, and opinions from all parties have also expressed agreement. Therefore, there was the amendment of the secondary school curriculum standards this year, with senior high schools divided into Group A and Group B. Although there is no formal name for liberal arts and science, in reality, there is no difference between the two, and vocational subjects are set up for students to choose. The Ministry of Education has long established a department specializing in vocational education, and its importance can be seen. The vocational education funding in various provinces and cities has gradually reached the standards set by the ministry. This year, there is also a subsidy for excellent vocational schools to encourage them. Compulsory education in our country has been advocated for more than twenty years, but it has not been fully realized due to financial reasons. Until last year, through the greatest efforts of the Ministry of Education, this item of funding was included in the national budget, which is one of the most memorable events in educational administration. The budget for the 25th year has increased from 3.2 million yuan to 4.7 million yuan. In addition to establishing a Compulsory Education Committee to specialize in design, the Ministry of Education has recently added a Compulsory Education Section to manage compulsory education administrative matters. The promotion of compulsory education in the border areas has also gradually been given more attention in recent years, and the funding for border education has also increased this year. The recent establishment of a national normal school in Suiyuan is a precursor to promoting compulsory education in Mongolia and Tibet. The trend of general education administration, in terms of secondary schools, has tended towards grouping; vocational education has gradually become widespread; and compulsory education has gradually expanded from urban and rural areas to border areas.</p>
<p>In terms of social education, in addition to expanding public schools and public education centers, the new important facility is the implementation of broadcasting education. Broadcasting education is still a pioneering undertaking in our country. Its effectiveness is difficult to accurately assess as it has not been implemented for long. Public education has never had implementation standards. Since the Ministry of Education promulgated the regulations for public schools, curriculum facilities have had uniform standards. Recently, the Ministry of Education is working hard to edit public readings and textbooks for public schools, which are expected to be promulgated soon. The trend of social education administration has shifted from quantitative progress to substantive attention and has gradually shifted from narrow social education to broad social education.</p>
<h3>Overview of Academic Organizations of All Types in the Country in the Past Three Years</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education recently compiled statistics on the situation of various academic organizations in the country in the past three years. The following is a summary:</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government Abolishes Education Fee Audit Committees in Various Counties: Simplification of Regulations Announced by the Education Department</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government, in view of the previous regulations on the preliminary audit of the income and expenditure of education funds in various counties, originally formed an audit committee composed of representatives from local party and government and education agencies to hold monthly meetings to review and prevent abuses such as omissions in receipts, excessive expenditures, and forged documents. Since its implementation, only a few have been able to conduct audits in earnest, and most have been perfunctory. Even worse, they have used the opportunity of absence and quorum to achieve their factional or personal purposes. The calculation of income and expenditure, due to the lack of a quorum, cannot be sent to the province for audit, and the number of such cases is increasing day by day, causing more abuses and failing to account for the situation. At present, each county has an accounting director to handle the preliminary audit of the income and expenditure of all public funds in the county. This County Education Fund Audit Committee should be abolished. Yesterday, a special order was issued to all counties to abolish the County Education Fund Audit Committee Regulations previously announced by the Education Department.</p>

<h3>Securities: Nearing Settlement, Public Bonds See New Highs Again, Class A Exceeds 70 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange market situation was still very good. The multiple parties had remaining courage to sell. Class A actually broke through the 70 yuan mark and saw new highs again. Class B also found new highs because of this. In the public bond market, because the settlement was imminent, the short parties, fearful of the power of the multiple parties, seemed to have surrendered. The trend still has the possibility of continuing to rise, but a reversal should also be guarded against. Yesterday's process saw a large number of swaps of Nos. 10, 11, and 47 at the opening. There were advances and retreats between the long and short parties, but the supply and demand of chips still felt lacking. The rising wind rose again, and the trend was extremely firm, which was a good phenomenon that has not been seen since the unification of public bonds. Classes A and B both saw new highs again. Class A breaking through the 70 yuan mark was also the latest discovery record. Market prices were all four or five corners to seven or eight corners higher. The short parties rushed to cover their positions. In the second session, the short swaps of Classes E and D rose another one corner to four and a half corners. After entering, selling pressure gradually emerged. Nos. 4 and 11 came out, and Nos. 16 and 59 also sold a lot. The trend was slightly weaker. The rear row all slightly fell by five cents, one corner to three and a half corners. The trend has deviated from the normal track, and there are still two days left this month, and there are still many changes. As a result, except for the slightly five cents lower Class B of this month, the rest all rose again by four or five corners to nine corners. The total number of transactions was 11.3 million yuan. The results of its ups and downs are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: 5,000 Bales of New Yarn Arrive, Near-Term Once Retraces, But Far-Month Decline Slightly Stops</h3>
<p>The yarn market fell in the morning and rebounded at noon. The situation turned calm. In fact, it has been falling for several days, and it has fallen by more than 10 yuan compared with the high price on the 11th. Perhaps there will be a small reversal at some point, which is unknown. However, both the long and short parties have considerable preparations for this month, and the price difference between July and August is even greater, so arbitrage is possible again.</p>
<p>August Futures Can Be Arbitraged</p>
<p>The opening of the marked yarn market in the previous session was due to the fact that overseas yarn and cotton market conditions all fell, the market sentiment was not strong, and it was said that there were sufficient chips for delivery this month, with as many as 5,000 bales of new goods arriving. As a result, the near-month trend was greatly frustrated, and more and more sellers sold. The floating long threatened to settle their positions, and the far-month was pulled into the whirlpool, and the market was becoming more and more soft. As a result, each month fell by 1 yuan 2, 4, 6, and 8 corners compared with the closing price of the previous day. The opening of the afternoon session, the decline in this month is still heavy, breaking the 4 yuan mark, but the decline in the far month is moderate, because part of the multiple parties swaps, the second session near the month is flat, the far month suddenly jumped 8 and 9 corners to 1 yuan, because the price between this month and August can be arbitrage, the virtual wind turned to stability, and the brokerage firm and a certain aspect came to pull up and increase the code, the decline in the afternoon session stopped, and as a result, each month rose by 4, 5, 7 corners to 1 yuan compared with the closing price of the previous day.

<h3>Recent Inventory Numbers Still Large, Chen Cotton Rising Wind Starts Again, This and Next Month Jump Another 1.4 to 1.1 Yuan</h3>
<p>The cotton market saw Chen cotton turn upward. There were only two days of trading left in July, and there were still 152,800 dan of inventory. It is said that the multiple sides are still calm and motionless. It is also said that the cotton inspected by the cotton inspection office has reached 60,000 to 70,000 dan, and it is still difficult to determine whether tens of thousands of dan will be delivered.</p>
<p>Marked Cotton Chen Rises and New Falls</p>
<p>The opening of the marked cotton market in the previous session was due to the fact that US cotton fell by 10 to 17 points due to Wall Street sales and multiple parties settling their positions. Indian cotton was suspended, and Osaka Sanpin cotton fell by 6.7 corners. The market sentiment was still not good, and people expected it to be low. Chen cotton fell by 4 corners to 1 and a half corners. The selling pressure of new cotton was even stronger, with a sharp drop of 3 and 4 corners. In the second and third sessions, Chen cotton slowly rose, but new cotton was normal. At the close, Chen cotton turned firm, and the far month was motionless. As a result, Chen cotton rose by 1 and 3 corners compared with the closing price of the previous day, and the far fell by 4 and a half corners to 5 corners. The opening of the afternoon session saw the multiple parties of July and August remain calm and motionless, jumping by 8 corners to 9 and a half corners, and the far month followed the rise by 1 and a half corners.

<p>Raw Cotton Factories Need to Shut Down</p>
<p>The consumption of raw cotton is still clear and quiet, and the factory needs are still depressed. The source Yao cotton is 1,280 bales.</p>
<h3>US and British Cotton Prices Rebound and Fall, Indian Cotton Suspended, Sanpin Yarn and Cotton Also Small</h3>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton opened, and each month rose or fell by 1 to 5 points. Although the Liverpool news fell in the morning, the market was firm because of purchases by peers and local firms, and the lack of rain in Oklahoma. The weekly weather report predicted that it was unfavorable. Then, because there were 15 delivery notices in July, Wall Street multiple parties settled their positions, and buyers arbitrage sold. Textile needs prevented peers from entering the market, and the market rebounded. There was a slight short covering before the close. The current needs were quiet, and the foot was still firm. The spot fell by 17 points, and the futures fell by 10 to 17 points. British cotton fell by 3 points for spot and 5 to 6 points for futures. Indian cotton was suspended. The original Lei recorded on the left (22nd telegram).</p>
<p>According to a Mumbai telegram, the opening forecast on the 23rd was that the July-August White Luo Creek was 230 rupees, down 5.25 rupees, the April-May White Luo Creek was 216 rupees, down 5 rupees, and the December-January Omra was 196 rupees, down 3.75 rupees.</p>

<h3>Head: Cotton Cloth Insufficient for Demand, Japanese Factories Undertake Orders for Indian and Nanyang Fine Cloth, Padded Warehouse Receipt Must Be Issued One to Two Weeks Later</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market saw continued good actual sales, and the demand for East China fine cloth and fine twill spot goods was still insufficient. The spot goods could only be issued one to two weeks after the padded warehouse receipt. The market price of warehouse receipts and spot goods was more than one corner apart. Japanese factories such as Shanghai and Gongda in Shanghai are shipping orders for Indian and Nanyang ten-yard fine cloth, otherwise it will become more difficult. Therefore, although the yarn and cotton have rebounded, the market is still very firm. The August fine cloth of each factory is quite open, and the factory price is five points higher than the market price. The dyeing factories are still healthy for brands such as Trumpet Boy, Five-Width Collection Detailed Dragon Head, etc., and the transaction has reached more than a thousand pieces. However, after the order for foreign yarn was issued, the market for foreign yarn and cloth, which is under ten pounds, was sluggish due to the decline in demand and gradually fell, dropping by as much as four corners per sheet from the high point a week ago. The printed cotton flannel for the autumn sales season has been set by various factories one after another, totaling more than 8,000 boxes. The patterns of the Changzhou Dacheng Factory are the most novel and wonderful. The selling price of the Hero and Rabbit brands is currently set at 1 corner 9.25 points per yard, which is also higher than the products of other factories. Flannel has also been ordered in large quantities. In addition to the weaving by each factory, most of the cloth is undertaken by the Shanghai and Changzhou thread factories. Therefore, the shortage of plain cotton cloth in the market is also due to this reason. Yesterday's customer routes saw the best sales in Sichuan and Hunan provinces. The fine cloth purchases of the Cantonese gang were still healthy, and the actual needs of the other routes were developing.</p>
<h3>Foreign Goods Are Quite Scarce, Yuanfang's Calling Price Inevitably Loses Color</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Thursday, and it was the 2999th auction of Yuanfang. Only four types of goods were on display: Western satin, Yuan feather silk, Yuan velvet, and Zhigong ne, totaling 27 brands and 30 boxes. Recently, due to the scarcity of foreign goods, bleached cloth, white foreign yarn, Yuanfu silk, and foreign red and blue cloth, which were out of stock, were not included. The market was dull, and the calling price lost color compared with the previous session. Western satin fell by two or three cents, Yuan velvet was good by one cent, and Zhigong ne rose by two and a half cents. All 18 brands of Yuan feather silk saw a decline, the flower-rotten brand fell by five corners, and the rest fell by one or two corners. Among them, Yanguo Gong San Yuan Second Brand was added, which had not been included for a long time, and the calling price was also normal.</p>
<h3>Food: Chips Feel Lacking, This Month's Flour Still Reaches the Limit Price</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after the opening in the morning, the months again showed a stable state. Because this month will have to be delivered soon, the short side's chips also felt lacking, so the opening price reached the limit price, and transactions also stopped. From August onwards, the situation was also tight at first because customers had a lot of resistance, such as November and December also reached the limit price, but later it was slightly weaker because the floating long spit out. Until the opening in the afternoon, this month still reached the limit price, and there was no sign of relaxation. The far term was stable at first because the industry had a foreign set, and the people's hearts were stable, but after entering, they were not smooth, and generally turned to stability, and the general public believed that the main food, rice, was gradually loosening, so speaking from the facts, it would be difficult to excessively fly.</p>
<h3>Wheat Price Is Already Similar to Coarse Rice, Futures Trading Is Even More Clear</h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market saw all months generally stable after the opening in the morning. Because foreign wheat quotations varied, although domestic quotations in the producing areas were not greatly loosened, the rice value in recent days, because new rice had to be put on the market again in another month, the current market price of coarse rice was already similar to the wheat price. With this comparison, it seemed that wheat could not rise alone, so there were few transactions and the price was flat. Until the opening in the afternoon, the recent transactions were still clear. September and October were slightly down one or two points due to the multiple long coming back. November and December did not open all day. The current wheat market saw high goods raised by two points, and medium and secondary factories did not handle them. The opening price of Kaimingguang Guan Dian Shahe set wheat was 4 yuan 57 points, Jiangxi wheat was 4 yuan 30 points and a half, secondary 20 points, Chuzhou wheat was 4 yuan 55 points, secondary 53 points, Huaian wheat was 4 yuan 49 points, secondary 46 points, Huangqiao wheat was 4 yuan 50 points, secondary 48 points, Suqian wheat was 4 yuan 52 points, secondary 50 points, Hankou wheat was 4 yuan 38 points, Five thousand bales were handled by Fuxin and two thousand bales were handled by Shenda.</p>
<h3>New Goods Will Be on the Market in a Few Days, Customers Cut Prices to Seek Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday, customers from various routes continued to arrive in Shanghai, and the merchants and hoarders still mainly sold quickly. Because the weather was hot, it was inevitable that the goods would heat up and be damaged if they were shelved for a long time, and the drought in various places would be on the market in a few days. In another ten and a half months, early rice would be seen on the market. Once the new goods arrived, Chen rice would be even more affected. Therefore, most of the producing areas along the Yangtze River are also falling in price to seek sales. Under the sales of various firms yesterday, the price suddenly fell by about one corner to two corners. After the price fell, the market was still lively. The local customer firms all had entertainment, but the amount of entertainment was not large, totaling only more than 5,000 bales. It was still not easy to reverse the downward trend. A total of 3,353 bales of Jiangxi rice, 81 bales of Wenzhou rice, and 1,610 bales of Xiang rice were opened all day.</p>
<h3>River Rice Arrives Sparsely and Sales Are Also Light, Market Price Is Reduced Again and Again</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Although only ten or so firms arrived from various sources yesterday, the sales on this street were even clearer. The Baowei Longkou Gang also only handled a thin hundred or so packages of rice, and the Nanyang Gang handled more than two hundred packages of thick粳rice, so the situation was tired and the market declined. As a result, the early and thick粳rice and thin indica rice prices were short of a few points to nearly a corner, and Du Yangjian was also devalued by five points. The arrival and sales of Yinyuan were both rare, without much honor or disgrace.</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the number of boats arriving at the river from various gangs was sparse, only about ten. Therefore, the early market of the customers called for higher prices of medium and secondary white粳rice by nearly a corner. Later, because the sales were ordinary, the market stabilized. Thin indica rice was out of stock and not opened. High-quality Yang rice stood up with difficulty, and the price of medium and low-quality rice was also reduced by about one corner. Bai Yuan Tingxiu, Du Bu's customer tips were slowly disassembled and the price was reduced by a few points. The price of other goods showed a tired trend.</p>
<h3>Oil Factories Start to Inquire About New Soybeans</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation for new soybeans continued to rise. New goods from various routes saw high prices, but high-quality goods were still not rushing out. More than one oil factory was inquiring about the sales routes, so the atmosphere in the market was more lively. More than 700 packages of Chengmendou were opened at prices ranging from 5 yuan 70 cents to 45 cents, 30 packages of Jiangqiaodou were priced at 5 yuan 70 cents, more than 150 packages of Duchangdou were priced at 5 yuan 80 cents, more than 60 packages of Poyangdou were priced at 5 yuan 80 cents, and 23 packages of Sanyangdou were priced at 5 yuan 80 cents, 23 points, Liu Fang Chi Bean 50 parcels for sale, price five yuan seven jiao half, and other local manufacturers taken to Siping street bean 100 parcels, and factories taken to Chongming Sha Huang more than 1000 parcels, stable market.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Overseas Silk Prices Rise and Fall Very Slightly, Foreign Firms' Hand-Pulled Silk Transactions Reach 145 Pieces</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign silk market saw very slight ups and downs. New York spot fell by half a point, and futures prices were unchanged. Yokohama spot rose by 2 yuan, and futures fell by 2 yuan. Both domestic and foreign silk transactions were quiet. Only Dachangyang Bank entered 10 pieces of Shuang Leopard from the white factory. The white factory's sales channels on the user side were firm and dull, and it was not as active as the Shandong yellow warp. Xinfu continued to sell Yangzhuang hand-pulled silk yesterday, and the price rose by about 2 yuan compared with the previous price, with a total of 145 pieces traded.</p>
<h3>County Pearl Tea Transactions Are Smooth</h3>
<p>Yesterday's tea market in local foreign firms saw the county's firm's shrimp-eye pearl tea, Tongfu, Xiehe, and other firms, start business one after another. The market price opened at 789 yuan, not much higher than before, but there is a hope that sales will continue to be smooth. Luzhuang's Zhenmei green tea, and Gaozhuang, were seen walking again. The middle and low-quality goods were still sluggish. Items such as Zhenmei, Xiumei, and Gongxi also had no large sales. The black tea market was becoming more and more deserted, but the British and Russian firms were still active. A huge amount of more than 3,000 boxes was exported yesterday.</p>
<p>According to the report of the Tea Stack Industry Association, Zhenmei from various routes was still quite depressed yesterday, but the firms still had the intention to handle high-quality goods, and the selling price was stable. For example, the Zhumei of the Four Famous Families was sold to Baitou Bank yesterday at a price of 114 yuan. Although the various firms offered back prices for medium-quality goods, the transactions were quite few because the prices were harsh. Jinlong handled about 200 boxes of 756 yuan Tunzhen, and Tongfu also had slight transactions for Tunxi shrimp eyes. The large gang of Pingshui tea had a slight motivation, but the price was slightly reduced compared to before. Xiehe continued to enter more than 100 pieces of Zhenmei, with prices ranging from 29 yuan to 32 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Hainan Raw Sugar Rises Two Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the prices of domestic refined sugar and other sugar types remained firm, while foreign sugar was still flat and soft. The guild's listed price for No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar spot goods was 22 yuan, and for transit goods, it was 6 yuan and 7 cents, with continuous transactions. East White spot goods: No. 4 was 21 yuan and 9 cents, No. 8 was 21 yuan and 4 cents, and No. 9 was 21 yuan, 1 cent and 5 mills. Transit goods: No. 4 (J mark) was 6 yuan and 7 cents, No. 8 (TK mark) was 6 yuan and 5 cents and 5 mills, and TM mark was 6 yuan and 4 cents. No. 1 refined white sugar from local factories such as Zhenji, Dahua, and Jinxin were all 20 yuan and 5 cents. Several Guangchao merchants offered more than 500 bags of Hainan raw sugar at 12 yuan and 5 cents, an increase of 2 cents. A batch of 85 bags of Chongti Qing sugar was priced at 11 yuan and 6 cents. It is estimated that there were 300 bags of refined raw sugar. Jiyuan Yu was priced at 15 yuan and 1 cent, and Hechang Dexing was priced at 14 yuan and 3 cents to 1 cent, an increase of 1 to 2 cents. It is heard that Shantou exchange rates have slightly improved to 1,180 yuan, an increase of 20 yuan compared to the previous day. Only about 400 bags of Hainan raw sugar were imported from Zhou, and transactions were close to 13 yuan. The arrival of refined raw sugar is also scarce, with more than 300 bags transported from Yunnan.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Thick Iron Spot Goods Are About to Run Out</h3>
<p>Since the military factories, toy factories, and machine factories started purchasing thick iron, it has been selling very well. Recently, due to a sudden large-scale purchase by certain organizations, the circulating goods on the market are almost exhausted. The standard price has therefore risen steadily. Currently, the market price for No. 24 (30-inch, 36-inch) is 140 yuan per box, which is 5 yuan higher than before. No. 26 (30-inch, 36-inch) is 90 yuan per box, which is also 7 to 8 yuan higher than before. A type of "wild chicken" goods (70 sheets per box, weighing 200 pounds) is priced at 70 yuan. Because of the shortage of genuine goods, customers and factories are buying as much as possible. It is reported that more than 100 boxes were offered on the market yesterday, so the market is expected to continue to be bullish.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods: Zhangzhou Twigs Prices Fall Frequently; First Batch of Four Pieces of Hainan Longan Arrive</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of Zhangzhou twigs kept falling because the market price of sorted Lan Zhu goods was cheaper than before, and the production price telegraph reported a drop later. Therefore, by the afternoon, when the merchants opened the market, the market was sluggish, and the price of ordinary goods fell by a small amount of three or four yuan. The price reduction of the remaining black leaf twigs was not significant because of the small arrival volume. If sales are smooth in the future, there is hope for a recovery, otherwise it will be difficult to stabilize.</p>
<p>It is heard that the first batch of new Hainan longan, four pieces, has been delivered to the merchants yesterday. The samples have not been seen yet, and the market is expected to open around today or tomorrow.</p>

<h3>Her Frustration</h3>
<p>— Long Gonggong</p>
<p>I have seen a failed philanthropist. This setback seemed to have confused her with irreparable blows, and finally plunged her into inexplicable sorrow. She was called Second Granny Zhou. She lived in a side street of Ren Zhonghua Middle Road (a market in Guangzhou famous for buying and selling used clothes, just like Shilu or Wusong Road in Shanghai). She was fat, and her attire from the ear pick on her head to the cloth shoes on her feet was very old-fashioned. Her purpose in doing good deeds was not to help others, but to help her own existing or future children and grandchildren.</p>
<p>One afternoon, thirty or forty beggars came to Zhonghua Middle Road. They were all from the local area and nearby villages. No one knew how they gathered together and ran there. Their clothes - more accurately, some tattered sacks and pieces of cloth - had lost their original meaning as clothes and had become randomly arranged decorations on their bodies, revealing various parts of their bodies: bones, sparse body hair, sores, rotten tumors, and reproductive organs like horses and wild dogs.</p>
<p>It was winter, and they sat under a white wall full of sunshine like a tired team of long-distance walkers all made up of men, laughing loudly, sighing, singing, and cursing. The constable was a young man with an eye disease. He borrowed the telephone from a business to report the incident to the police station. Then he stood next to the pile of beggars, holding his eyes with a handkerchief, pretending not to care about them at all. What was the police station's solution? - Someone asked him, but he just shook his head, indicating that he was unwilling to say. Therefore, I guess it might be the kind of order that is difficult to execute:</p>
<p>"You bastard! Are they going to sit in your post forever? - Pay attention to when they leave, or you find a way to drive them away..."</p>
<p>Second Granny Zhou ran over with a bamboo basket. Her anxious and pitiful appearance was as if she was carrying a brass-nozzled canvas hose to a fire scene, walking without choosing her way. Even in such a heroic occasion, her fat limbs still stumbled like a mother goose. She spoke loudly to the shop assistants on both sides of the sidewalk. Every time the features on her face squeezed, it made people see the oil oozing from every pore. The bamboo basket contained a roll of ten dollars worth of small change - that was fifty double dimes. In Guangzhou, people are used to rolling ten dollars into a roll as thick as a chicken neck. Second Granny Zhou broke open the silver dimes in front of the beggars, ordered those strangely shaped men to stand still and not move, and then distributed her alms to them one by one according to the number of people.</p>
<p>The silver coins made a crisp sound when they were shaken and grabbed - this sound subdued those despised and lowly creatures, and they immediately became orderly and good citizens. Second Granny Zhou walked among them with extraordinary joy, speaking in a voice as if she were singing sweet song lines.</p>
<p>"You there, you one there!</p>
<p>You there, you another one there!"</p>
<p>But when it came to the seventeenth person, she was deceived, lost her dignity, joy, and harmony.</p>
<p>"You cheap bone! You 'buried on the mountainside'! I recognize you, you just took two dimes from me, why are you here again?"</p>
<p>She scolded the beggar. And from among that pile of waste-like men, someone shouted at the same time:</p>
<p>"What about him? What about him? Qi Toulin also got a second share!" Qi Toulin</p>
<p>(This is a nickname with insulting meaning) and the person who shouted started fighting each other first.</p>
<p>Second Granny Zhou's sacred and happy feelings were shattered, as if she had been bitten by a dog while feeding it. She raised her hand and hit the seventeenth beggar. She punished the evildoer without thinking because his greedy heart had ruined all this purity.</p>
<p>The beggars began to snatch the silver dimes, bumping into each other fiercely, twisting together, forming a large chaotic conflict. Some people threw the dimes far away, and everyone chased after them. Some crawled horizontally on the ground, one pressing on top of the other. Some continued to bump into each other unexpectedly but frequently, and fell down.</p>
<p>Second Granny Zhou lost everything and was then pulled out of the crowd by the constable with the eye disease. She stood next to the people fighting in the melee that she had caused, which no one could calm down, stomping her feet and scolding. The shop assistants on both sides of the sidewalk laughed loudly at this uncontrollable scene...</p>
<h3>Jia Tangguan</h3>
<p>— Yin Guang</p>
<p>This is a very healthy old man, with a sharp and snow-white beard, and a face as full and shiny as a child's, only covered with wrinkles, yellow with black, looking like cultivated Coptis chinensis. No matter how two or three young people who consider themselves humorous cannot help but smirk and purse their lips when they see him walk into the teahouse. In fact, he is still considered a very reputable person in the county town. He has been a public servant in the county for fifteen or sixteen years, but in terms of fame, he is only a student of the Imperial Academy. When investigating his background, he is not an important figure's "old cousin's old cousin." Just from this point, we can know how unreasonable it is to despise him.</p>
<p>This may be what is called good luck in old age. He lived silently until he was nearly sixty years old before he began to appear on the county's political stage, and it was so sudden that even he himself could hardly believe it. At that time, the one in power in the whole county was Chen Sandai Wu, a cunning and venomous man. His great-grandfather was a tribute student, he himself had stayed in a government-run law school for a few days, and his brother was a famous leader of the former Old Society. With these forces, one autumn, he finally defeated his political enemy, a madman with the title of "Ju Ren" (a degree attained in the imperial examinations). Thus, the old man began his political career.</p>
<p>Originally, as soon as Sandai Wu came to power, several key figures in the various organs, some of whom considered themselves noble, and some of whom had too close a relationship with the madman with the title of "Ju Ren," unanimously adopted a policy of non-cooperation and resigned one after another. He was in a dilemma because he was wary of some of the successors, and some of them were wary of him. But one morning, as he was squatting on a wicker chair smoking a water pipe, feeling frustrated, he suddenly slapped his forehead and laughed to himself, "How could I forget Jia Tangguan!" Thus, from this time until his death, the old man rarely wavered in his position as chairman of the Farmers' Association, as if it were a lifelong position.</p>
<p>He was very amiable and always smiled, with intelligent and gentle eyes. He could talk to anyone, and although he didn't say much, he wouldn't give you a headache. Anger and impatience were not related to him. The characteristic of his entire character seemed to be only his peace and openness. He had a son, who was very handsome and had stayed in a military academy for three months, but he died when the old man turned sixty. Even this did not agitate him much. Half a year later, he calmly took in a maid as his concubine, saying, "This is more convenient."</p>
<p>After this incident, whenever people talked about how he could be as healthy as a middle-aged man, he would laugh heartily, tap the tip of his beard with his finger, and then answer seriously, "Didn't the book say it? 'Xiao, bu zhi zai?' (Small, is it not a supplement?)". His smile would immediately fill his face again.</p>
<p>His family was not wealthy, only having two or three shi of unpolished rice sent by tenant farmers every year. The house was rented, but he lived comfortably, without any extravagant desires. He was even more unwilling to touch any unclean money. It was precisely because of this that he had never been a witness in several cases of financial corruption in the county town's public affairs. The only thing he thought he shouldn't let go of was his regular salary. Because it was somewhat of a mandatory nature, the salary was very small, and it was often in arrears. But even if he came back empty-handed from the local revenue and expenditure office for three months in a row, he would not be disappointed. He could calmly wait for an opportunity: when the heads of those local agencies initiated an official document asking him to stamp it, he only needed to roll his eyes and talk to them about the weather, and that would be enough. Originally, according to the old man's habit, as soon as he saw the sealed envelope, he would unhesitatingly pull out his Shoushan stone personal seal. Even some people who did not know his temperament, for the sake of name and responsibility, insisted that he look at the contents of the official document, but he would refuse.</p>
<p>"I won't look," he said with a smile, shaking his head, "I'll just stamp it for you." So he casually stamped his seal under his title.</p>
<p>If someone else made such a simple move, it would definitely cause discomfort to the opposing party, but it rarely happened to him. Because there could be such a person in the world, who is usually difficult to speak up, always silent, showing a friendly appearance, but when they unexpectedly say every word clearly, you will blush in the first minute, feeling that there are bones in those words. But when you carefully examine their intelligent and frank eyes, you will naturally breathe a sigh of relief and smile along with him. The old man was exactly this kind of character.</p>
<p>Moreover, in some occasions, his out-of-the-blue remarks, which made inexperienced people embarrassed, could also lead to some unexpected practical effects, which not only made people feel interesting. Once, at a county administrative meeting, in order to impose additional land taxes, two equally matched political leaders suddenly slammed the table and argued, and even the partisans on both sides were ready to fight. At this time, the old man calmly touched the teacup with his finger and said with a smile, "What are you arguing about? It will be passed anyway!" Everyone frowned immediately, but then they couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>He attended the county administrative meetings every time, although he rarely expressed his opinions. He always sat next to the county magistrate, silently drinking tea, sometimes looking at the participants who were stating their opinions in a high-pitched voice, and then immediately staring at his own teacup and smiling, as if he was there to listen in, or as a token gesture. However, whenever a proposal was put to a vote, he would not forget to raise his hand, and he had never not raised his hand to agree. Although he seemed like the representatives from those remote small towns who came to the meeting, he often did not understand the content of the proposals they were voting on. The difference was that those honest and timid local gentry would always pat others on the shoulder after the meeting and ask, "Hey, what was passed just now?" And when they raised their hands, they would also look at the other participants. If there were too few people raising their hands to agree, or if the people they considered important were still blowing their water pipes noisily, they would blush and reluctantly drag their arms down. But the old man was not like this. As long as he expressed his approval, it was as if everything was over.</p>
<p>He also rarely missed other gatherings, such as welcoming newly appointed officials; especially various banquets. At every banquet, he always sat in the seat of honor, and as soon as he sat down at the table, he would always remember to pull out a faded white handkerchief from his arms with a smile, muttering to himself, "Let me take some back for my grandson." Then he would leisurely reach his hands into the plates and dishes of fruits and various preserved meats.</p>
<p>He passed away five years ago. His death caused great inconvenience to several important figures. Whenever they were troubled by the selection of personnel for various agencies and organizations, they would always remember him and say angrily, "Damn it! It would have been better if Jia Tangguan hadn't died!"</p>

<h3>Rainy Day Poem</h3>
<p>— Chu Yang</p>
<p>My mood these days I can't even be sure of myself</p>
<p>Like a misty lake on a rainy day:</p>
<p>The weather is uncertain, and dark clouds often shroud the sun;</p>
<p>The bright sail shadow is gone,</p>
<p>And it is difficult to distinguish the white gulls that are rippling on the edge of the water bottom.</p>
<p>Imagination, oh, that is a distant, unknown village!</p>
<p>Dream, oh, do you want to find grapes in thorns?</p>
<p>The lilies in the wilderness are all dead.</p>
<p>It is all poppies, blooming with purple and yellow poisonous flowers.</p>
<p>Do you want to suck the intoxicating fragrance of anesthesia with your dry mouth?</p>
<p>This heavy rain cannot wash away my mood,</p>
<p>Just as a torrent of tears cannot exhaust my sorrow.</p>
<p>Raindrops hit the lake surface, stirring up countless ripples,</p>
<p>My mood can never be calm.</p>
<p>Oh, the scene after the storm is too terrible</p>
<p>That deathly silence is too terrible!</p>
<p>Let my heartstrings beat forever without stopping,</p>
<p>Let the vitality of youth not be extinguished so early.</p>
<p>This rainy day is so lovely:</p>
<p>The wheat is yellow, the seedlings are green</p>
<p>The universe is always creating.</p>
<p>Put down the "departure" in your arms, pick up the hoe,</p>
<p>The land of life needs you to work hard,</p>
<p>Isn't a great sunny day after the continuous rain!</p>

<h3>Gorky's Funeral</h3>
<p>— Ge Baoquan</p>
<p>June 18th in the Soviet Union was a day of rest (note), but also a very unfortunate day. It was on this day, at 11:10 in the morning, that the great Soviet writer Maxim Gorky passed away due to a long illness at his villa near Moscow. After the Central Committee of the Soviet Union and the People's Committee announced this unfortunate news, Moscow became a city of sorrow. Black-bordered mourning flags on a red background were hung everywhere along the streets. Bookstore windows displayed Gorky's works, portraits, and bronze statues. Theaters canceled their performances, and cultural and recreational parks were temporarily closed, all expressing widespread grief over the death of this great writer.</p>
<p>By the morning of the 19th, newspapers were printed with large characters announcing the news of Gorky's death, along with condolences from Romain Rolland, George Bernard Shaw, and H.G. Wells, as well as mourning and commemorative texts written by Lenin's widow, André Gide, and other Soviet writers. For example, an editorial in *Pravda* stated that Gorky's death was like "the extinguishing of a lamp of reason." The editorial concluded, "Great is Gorky's genius, great is his service to the new humanity; his shining name will never be submerged by the flowing waters of the Lethe—the river of forgetfulness. The name of this great Russian writer, the brilliant artist of words, the close friend of laborers, and the warrior who fought for the victory of building a new society, will forever shine like the sun and stars, remaining in human memory, lasting for thousands of years!" Romain Rolland's condolence message was very short, just a few lines: "Regarding the death of our dear friend, I truly cannot describe how saddened I am. We now equally share the sorrow of the Soviet people." George Bernard Shaw said, "With him, the writers of the nineteenth century, his contemporaries, have become weaker by one." A commemorative text written by the Soviet writer Alexei Tolstoy included these words: "The light of the era of the three great revolutions has dimmed, and the last great writer of Russia has left us. Thanks to his art, the best traditions of pre-revolutionary literature, its most noble humanitarian ideals, and its ability to love, feel, and understand the human soul, can be connected to the still-young Soviet literature. He was our—strict and uncompromising—leader. From an artistic standpoint, he demanded even greater service. He was also the founder of Soviet humanism."</p>
<p>Gorky passed away in the village of Gorky, not far from Moscow. His body was transported to Moscow that day for a state funeral. The Soviet government also organized a national funeral committee to handle all funeral matters. From 9:00 AM on the 19th, Gorky's body was first laid in state in the Hall of Columns of the House of Trade Unions, where people could go to pay their respects. On that day, Gorky's portrait and four large mourning flags were hung in front of the House of Trade Unions. Gorky's body lay in the center of the Hall of Columns, surrounded by flowers and wreaths. An orchestra played funeral marches by Beethoven, Chopin, and Grieg. Government officials, famous writers, and representatives from various places stood beside the body as the Guard of Honor. For example, Stalin, Molotov, Orjonikidze, and Andreyea went to pay their respects at 4:30 PM that afternoon and stood beside the body for several minutes. On that day, Moscow's radio station also stopped broadcasting various programs, and all that could be heard were mournful music and mourning poems and prose discussed by Soviet writers. From eight or nine o'clock in the morning, crowds lined up to go to the House of Trade Unions, hoping to catch a last glimpse of Gorky's face. By that afternoon, the crowds had grown even larger. Gorky Street, Bolshaya Dmitrovka Street, and Petrovka Street, near the House of Trade Unions, were temporarily closed to traffic. The queue stretched for several miles. It is estimated that over one to two hundred thousand people passed before Gorky's body that day, which shows how much the Soviet people respected Gorky.</p>
<p>Gorky's body was cremated that night, and the ashes were placed in a small copper urn. From 9:00 AM on the 20th, it was still laid in state in the Hall of Columns of the House of Trade Unions, where people could go to pay their respects until the funeral. The funeral was held in Red Square in the center of Moscow. Red Square was very close to the House of Trade Unions. The route was lined with soldiers, police, and crowds. Only those with passes could go to Red Square to participate in the funeral. At 5:30, the funeral began. Stalin, Molotov, Kaganovich, and Orjonikidze stood beside Gorky's ashes as the final Guard of Honor. Then, to the sound of the Internationale, the small pavilion housing the urn was carried to Red Square. In front of the pavilion, someone held Gorky's portrait and a small red pillow with a Soviet government award, the Order of Lenin, on it. Behind the pavilion were Gorky's family, government officials, and writers.</p>
<p>As the funeral procession proceeded to Red Square, military bands played funeral marches along the way. Upon arriving at Red Square, the small pavilion housing the urn was placed on a red cloth-covered table in front of Lenin's Mausoleum. Stalin and others then walked up to Lenin's Mausoleum to begin the memorial ceremony. Molotov first gave a speech on behalf of the government and the Central Executive Committee of the Party. In his speech, Molotov said, "Since Lenin, Gorky's death is truly a great loss for the Soviet Union and all of humanity." Then, Bulganin gave a speech on behalf of the Moscow Soviet and the Moscow Provincial Party Committee, Alexei Tolstoy gave a speech on behalf of the Soviet Writers' Union, and finally, André Gide gave a speech in French. Gide said, "Gorky's death is not only a misfortune for the Soviet Union but for the entire world. Because of Gorky, the painful and great voice of the Russian people found an echo in countries near and far. Therefore, what I want to express here is not only my personal sorrow but the sorrow of the French literary world, the sorrow of the entire European cultural world, and the sorrow of the entire world cultural world." Finally, Gide said, "The greatest and most glorious task that Gorky bore throughout his life was to connect the old and new worlds and to build a bridge between the new world and the world of the future. He witnessed all the oppression and tragic struggles of the past, and he used his strength to help bring about today's victory. He spoke on behalf of the many who could not express their opinions, making their voices heard far and wide. From now on, Gorky is a historical figure and one of the great figures of all time."</p>
<p>After the speeches, Stalin and Tolstoy carried the pavilion with the ashes, passing to the right of Lenin's Mausoleum, and to the Kremlin wall behind the tomb. All the Soviet revolutionaries and government officials, as well as foreign revolutionary fighters who died in Moscow, were buried here. Gorky's ashes were placed in the wall to the sound of the Internationale and a 21-gun salute. Now, there is a black plaque on the wall that reads: "Alexei Maximovich Gorky. Born on March 28, 1868, Died on June 18, 1936."</p>
<p>At the time of Gorky's death, it is worth briefly discussing Gorky's life. Gorky's original name was Alexei Maximovich Peshkov, born on March 28, 1868, in Nizhny Novgorod (now Gorky City). Maxim Gorky was the pen name he later used for his works. His father was a carpenter, and his mother was the daughter of a dyer. Both died when Gorky was young, so Gorky spent most of his childhood living with his grandparents. At the age of eight, he attended primary school, but the school's curriculum did not spark his interest. Coupled with his family's poverty, he dropped out after a year or two and was sent to work as an apprentice in a shoemaker's shop. Details of his life at his grandparents' home and during his schooling can be found in his autobiographical novel, "My Childhood."</p>
<p>From the age of twelve, Gorky began a wandering life. He first worked as a dishwasher on a Volga River steamboat. At this time, there was a cook on the ship who often asked Gorky to read novels to him. According to Gorky himself, this was the first person to spark his love for literature. After leaving the steamboat, he also worked as an apprentice in an icon shop and as a small supervisor in a construction factory. In his spare time, he continued to read literary books. At the age of sixteen, he went to Kazan, hoping to study at the local university. However, this beautiful dream ultimately fell through, and he continued to live a wandering life, working as a porter at the dock and as an apprentice in a bakery. During this period, Gorky associated with progressive intellectuals and people engaged in revolutionary work. At the same time, he personally experienced the lives of various lower-class social groups. Therefore, Gorky said, this was his education, this was his "university."</p>
<p>In 1891, Gorky wandered to Tiflis in the Caucasus. In September of the following year, he published his first debut work in the Caucasus newspaper (Kavkaz). This can be said to be the beginning of his literary life. At the end of the same year, he returned to his hometown, where he was promoted and helped by the writer Korolenko. He formally embarked on a literary career and gradually gained fame in the literary world. From this time on, in addition to writing, Gorky also participated in the revolutionary movement. He was arrested and exiled several times. Even when he later went into exile abroad, he continued to engage in revolutionary work and became one of Lenin's close friends. In 1932, the Soviet government held a grand commemorative meeting to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of Gorky's literary career.</p>
<p>Gorky's works include the novels "My Childhood," "My Universities," "Mother," and "The Life of Klim Samgin." "The Life of Klim Samgin" has been published in three volumes, and the fourth volume was completed just before his death. His plays include "The Petty Bourgeois," "The Lower Depths," "Enemies," "Yegor Bulychov and Others," and others.</p>
<p>After Gorky's death, his brain was handed over to the Brain Research Institute in Moscow for anatomical research. His manuscripts are being edited and published by the Gorky Manuscripts Committee organized by the government. Statues of Gorky are planned to be erected in the three cities of Moscow, Leningrad, and Gorky. The State Literary Publishing House of Leningrad has established a Gorky Literary Prize to encourage Soviet writers to engage in writing. Regarding Gorky's works, 800,000 copies had been sold before the Great Revolution. From the beginning of the Great Revolution until recently, there have been a total of 150 versions in various national languages, and 387 versions in Russian, with a total sales volume of more than 31 million copies. Currently, various publishing houses in the Soviet Union are also planning to publish large quantities of new complete works and various popular versions. From this, it can be seen how widespread Gorky's works are and how common they are to read. Now that Gorky has passed away, recalling his life, how he went from being a vagrant to becoming a world-famous writer, his spirit of hard work and struggle is truly worthy of our admiration. As for his works, they will also be immortal and become one of the important milestones in the history of world literature.</p>
<p>(Note) The Soviet Union adopted a six-day week system, meaning six workdays and one day of rest. The 6th, 12th, 18th, 24th, and 30th of each month are rest days.</p>

<p>Talking Points</p>
<h3>Fly Death Case at the University</h3>
<p>— Me</p>
<p>Li Gan from Zhejiang and He Cangyun from Guangdong were students at St. John's University. On the 15th of this month, Li Gan bought a plate of egg fried rice from the kitchen. After eating only half of it, Li suddenly found a fly in the rice. He negotiated with the kitchen staff, at which time Zheng Jinhai, the kitchen bookkeeper, was calculating accounts with Zhang Yuanquan, the kitchen owner. There were large and small legal tender bills on the table. Li took one yuan of legal tender, saying it was temporarily a deposit. Later, Zhang Yuanquan asked Li to return the one yuan, leading to an argument. Zhang accused Li of being a robber, stealing five silver dollars, which angered Li. He Cangyun stepped forward and punched Zhang hard in the neck, causing Zhang to fall to the ground injured. He was sent to the hospital for treatment but died. The case was handed over to the criminal court of the First Special Court for trial the other day. He and Li are still denying the punch. The facts of the case were disclosed in the newspaper as such. Since the case is being tried by the court, the true facts will be investigated by the court. The students will be held responsible for whatever criminal charges they face, and the court will make a judgment. I don't need to elaborate. What I want to talk about is the issue of students' personal cultivation.</p>
<p>Let's assume that the facts are true for now. The first cause of the death was that the kitchen did not pay attention to hygiene, resulting in a fly being found in the egg fried rice. The kitchen is also responsible for neglecting its duties. The second cause was that the student seized one yuan of legal tender, and the subsequent request for its return led to the current tragedy. Therefore, the first fault lies with the kitchen, and the second fault lies with the student. Most kitchen staff in schools are careless and few pay attention to hygiene and cleanliness. Therefore, similar incidents involving flies are not uncommon in schools. The student should have reported the matter to the school authorities and had the kitchen punished to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. That would have been the end of the matter.</p>
<p>The tragedy occurred because of the seizure of one yuan of legal tender. This kind of behavior is clearly wrong in terms of the student's character. It is clear that the student's seizure of one yuan was not to steal the money but was a kind of playful act. If it was said that the one yuan was a deposit, is the student's life only worth one yuan? If it was to steal the money, why did the student only take one yuan and stop there? In short, the student's act of seizing one yuan as a deposit not only unexpectedly led to a tragedy, which was not foreseen, but also damaged the student's character.</p>
<p>Therefore, I learned a lesson from the student's actions this time. Students are full of youthful energy and rely on their strength to act fiercely. They often act impulsively and are unwilling to consider things carefully. Once a punch is thrown, life is lost. By this point, it is too late to stop. The cause was only a fly, and the seizure was only one yuan of legal tender, yet it led to such an unfortunate result. How could the student have foreseen this? Students have no deep-seated hatred for the kitchen, and there is no reason to deliberately cause death. Yet, unknowingly, they "created a huge disaster." Young people must not be reckless when doing things. This is a clear example.</p>
<h3>Singing Girl Liu Chun</h3>
<p>— Liu Ziming</p>
<p>The sun was already high overhead, but Liu Chun's room was still quiet without a sound. Her mother, Zeng Jue, walked back and forth at the door, but afraid of disturbing her daughter's sweet dreams, she would only peek in and then walk away upon seeing the curtains drawn.</p>
<p>Liu Chun was a singing girl at the Flying Immortal Pavilion. Because she was beautiful and knew how to handle customers, the money-spending gentlemen and young masters were so happy that Liu Chun became the red singing girl at the Flying Immortal Pavilion. Every day she went on stage, the placards with requests for her songs were hung up one after another. She often sang until her voice was hoarse. Although the customers didn't care about her singing, her companions became jealous and deliberately spoke ill of her backstage to mock her. On stage, Liu Chun received applause and cheers from the customers, but backstage she was alone. She often wanted to have an opportunity to explain her difficulties to her sisters, but because she was a red singing girl, a deep divide had already been built between her and her companions. They treated her like an enemy. She could only wear a smiling face to win the customers' favor and could not get sympathy from her sisters who shared the same fate. She lived a lonely and solitary life.</p>
<p>It was the day before yesterday. As soon as she came off stage, the boss was already waiting backstage.</p>
<p>"Hard work, hard work, Miss Liu." The boss shrugged his shoulders and personally wrung a towel for Liu Chun. Of course, that was a common occurrence. The boss was always particularly attentive to his cash cow. But that day's situation seemed a little special. The boss waited until Liu Chun had removed her makeup and then whispered mysteriously in her ear:</p>
<p>"Several gentlemen have invited Miss Liu to go boating on the lake. They are waiting for you outside the door. Please do us the honor."</p>
<p>Liu Chun did not answer. She stared at the boss. The boss misunderstood her meaning and whispered even more modestly: "It's the table that ordered thirty plays today."</p>
<p>"Boss," Liu Chun almost laughed, "Don't you know the rules here? Please thank them for me. Singing girls don't have that kind of fortune!"</p>
<p>The boss took a step closer, chuckling. His face seemed to be reflected in a funhouse mirror, like a pug. He spoke a little louder:</p>
<p>"Miss Liu, you really don't know this. They are all officials, with section chiefs and ministers and all. Who would be afraid to accompany them boating?" He took another step closer, comparing heights with Liu Chun, "They don't care about spending money. Look, isn't it thirty plays at once? Miss Liu, congratulations! Hahaha..."</p>
<p>Without waiting for Liu Chun to answer, the boss went to the customers, still laughing, to reply to their invitation. Liu Chun seemed to have lost consciousness, hanging her head and following behind him. There were four or five people waiting outside the door. Seeing Liu Chun behind the boss, they rushed forward, shouting "Miss Liu, do us the honor!" (If you close your eyes and think about it, we can often see that kind of slapstick performance on stage.)</p>
<p>Summer nights are particularly short. Liu Chun arrived home just as the sky was about to turn white. She was slightly drunk, her face flushed, and her palms were clammy. She got out of the car in a daze. When her mother came to open the door, she stumbled into the old woman's arms.</p>
<p>The next day, Liu Chun fell ill and asked for leave from the day shift. The boss panicked and took a car to her house, bringing several kinds of Western medicine and inviting a famous doctor to diagnose her. The doctor said that she had caught a cold and would be fine after a few days of rest.</p>
<p>But the Flying Immortal Pavilion could not do business without Liu Chun. The day shift hung up a sign saying that Liu Chun was on sick leave. Those customers who hadn't even sat down all turned back, and many more asked whether she would be on stage for the night shift.</p>
<p>The boss had not left Liu Chun's room by dinnertime. He just paced in circles with his hands behind his back, as if Liu Chun would immediately jump out of bed. Seeing that it was almost time for the Flying Immortal Pavilion to open, a young shop assistant was waiting outside for news of whether Liu Chun would be on stage. The boss finally pulled Liu Chun's mother aside and talked for a long time, and then she talked to her daughter for a long time. In the last ten minutes, the boss took Liu Chun to the Flying Immortal Pavilion by car.</p>
<p>When she returned, Liu Chun's face was pale, her fever was getting higher and higher, and she tossed and turned in bed, unable to sleep soundly. She took the medicine and didn't fall asleep until dawn.</p>
<p>After lunch, the boss came again. Liu Chun's mother had no choice but to go to the room to wake her daughter. Liu Chun's fever had not subsided, her cheeks were red, and she was sweating all over. She glanced at the boss, turned over, and went back to sleep.</p>
<p>The boss carefully sat on the edge of the bed and reached out to feel her forehead.</p>
<p>"Miss Liu, don't be angry. Your own body is important. To be honest, it's all my fault, but what can I do when I'm eating this rice bowl? They are officials, how can I, ×, let her run into the Flying Immortal Pavilion? Miss Liu, I've already hung up the leave sign for the day shift. Take good care of yourself, and we'll see about tonight. The Flying Immortal Pavilion relies on Miss Liu..."</p>
<p>Liu Chun couldn't help but cry. Was the boss sympathizing with her? Absolutely not. The customers were playing with her, the boss was using her, and her sisters were jealous of her. She had no one who loved her, no one who sympathized with her, only beauty, youth, and the selling of her soul! She thought about the future. Could she be a singing girl all her life?</p>
<p>"Mom," she cried out, "I can't eat this rice bowl anymore! I can't eat this rice bowl anymore!"</p>
<p>Her mother, with tears streaming down her face, stroked her hot cheeks. "Child, calm down. Your body is important. Don't think wildly..." The old woman herself thought of her dead husband, her dead son. She only had this one daughter left. She hoped that her daughter would marry well, but was being a singing girl a way out?</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Writings from a Mountain City</h3>
<p>— Especially</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, we, this group, are delayed in this mountain city.</p>
<p>From morning until sunset, looking at the sky, it always wears an unhappy face. It's been hard to enjoy the sunshine these past two days. The musty dampness in the inn keeps rushing into my nostrils, a mixed stench that makes you want to retch. The sun, which we disliked so much on our journey, is now something we long for, hoping it will reveal its cruel face and fiercely shine on every dark corner, so that all the hidden spirits lurking in those corners will be completely annihilated.</p>
<p>People accustomed to city hotels can never imagine the stifling atmosphere of a mountain inn. Low pressure extends from the front desk all the way to the backyard. Not only can you not hear the sound of mahjong and laughter, you can't even find fellow travelers staying at the inn. Loneliness envelops the entire place, with a bitterness that feels like your throat is being choked.</p>
<p>The distant mountain peaks, blurred like gauze mist,</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>press down on the walls of the surrounding buildings. Chaos signifies the arrival of evening, and I resolutely taste the unwillingness to walk the pebbled road. Truly, there should be some gains today, right?</p>
<p>Usually, at dusk, in the relatively lively areas, to the left or right, you can often see several small tables arranged, draped with faded red woolen cloths. On top, there are writing brushes and inkstones, along with small offerings like incense and candles. The tabletop looks quite complicated, but you can't quite see it clearly. The area under the table is very warm, beyond people's line of sight. On one end, there's also a book placed, stacked high. The arrangement is somewhat like a fortune-telling stall in Shanghai, but you can't see anyone.</p>
<p>At first, strange thoughts kept stirring. Why can't you see anyone? Why are the tables propped up so high? Asking Ah Huang yields no definite answer. I thought: Maybe they are seeking divine guidance? Maybe they are writing letters and official documents for others? Maybe they are storytellers and fortune tellers? Who can say for sure? Like a riddle, it weighed on my mind for several days, unable to be solved. Today, the opportunity is quite opportune. A dozen people are gathered under the table, and a bearded elder is quoting from books and lecturing on maxims. The red flames of the candles cast light on the old man's face, revealing a remarkable degree of gauntness.</p>
<p>However, a traveler from afar cannot understand the local dialect. What exactly is the old man lecturing about? I cannot know, but he presents a quite solemn appearance. An idea slips into my mind: perhaps this is some kind of missionary work within a society? Here, I directly perceive the greatness of the power of preaching. At the same time, I cannot help but feel great admiration for this elaborate setup.</p>
<p>Late in the evening, the inn's food is too spicy to eat. I head to the large teahouse at the intersection of the T-shaped street, where dinner is not a problem. Brew a pot of tea, order a plate of large meat-filled buns, and at most, another one or two bowls of mutton noodles, enough to make you go back with a full stomach. In this way, the business is no less prosperous than any tea room in Shanghai.</p>
<p>In the teahouse, on the walls or pillars in places that don't obstruct the view, besides notices like "Beware of Money Loss" and "Personal Belongings at Your Own Risk," you rarely see phrases like "Do Not Discuss State Affairs." Although there are many people, the topics are mostly trivial household matters and business dealings. They seem to have completely cut off ties with national affairs. Originally, transportation hinders outside culture. In a mountain city where the level of culture cannot be raised, how can they appreciate everything outside?</p>
<h3>The Stout Man on a Long Journey</h3>
<p>— Zhuang Ruiyuan</p>
<p>In appearance and manner, because I resemble my younger brother in some ways, there have been huge misunderstandings. Apart from that, our differences are truly too great. Especially in temperament and interests, we are irreconcilable enemies.</p>
<p>We have always been together, but he has always been silent. No, he only shows hostility, plotting, and actions that are detrimental to me. I know my brother's temperament and interests. I have no resentment. Every time I use my fingers to smooth out the worry on my forehead, I also try to smooth out the worry on his forehead; but my efforts are all in vain, only increasing his hostility, plotting, and more actions detrimental to me.</p>
<p>Thus, the worlds that each of us privately construct are isolated from each other, very, very far apart. Although we have the same wounds, we have never confided in each other as a form of consolation, a form of support.</p>
<p>On winter nights, we silently drank some water to moisten our throats, which had become dry from the stove fire. But we would never easily break the silence between us just because we had moistened throats.</p>
<p>What a tiring long journey we are walking!</p>
<p>Only occasionally, we would sigh listlessly like this, using the same tired tone. Yes, we both clearly understand our journey, and yet we are such unfamiliar and unfortunate companions on the road! I would endure all the unbearable trembling, trying to support my younger brother as we walked our thorny path. I would have no resentment, anger, or regrets. For my brother's sake, I allowed him to question everything I did. On the lonely long journey, it should be beneficial for him to have his older brother accompanying him.</p>
<p>I tirelessly took care of him, comforted him, held his hand so he wouldn't leave me. Everything was for my brother's sake.</p>
<p>However, he, a person whose temperament and interests were opposed to mine, repaid me with hostility, plotting, and actions detrimental to me. He desperately struggled to break free of my hand. He wanted to break away from my care. He resolutely shouldered all the difficult and complex ambitions. He left me with these firm words:</p>
<p>"Go away! I hate you. Your companionship is just another burden to me. I want to go outside alone, to seek, suffer, and even destroy myself for my own sake. And you should also explore your own path!" Thus, my younger brother walked away from me, and further and further apart. I knew that on the long road full of dust and wind, my younger brother was still struggling, forever seeking, suffering, and even destroying himself for his own sake. On his forehead, the worry that my fingers had once smoothed out may have already disappeared. He would laugh, sing in the desert, without worry or pain!</p>
<p>But in me, the worry that I had once smoothed out existed again on my forehead, because I had lost my younger brother. Although we both clearly understand our journey, and yet we are such unfamiliar and unfortunate companions on the road!"</p>
<p>"But, come back! Brother."</p>
<p>In the wind and snow, in the dust storm, I lowered my face, feeling utterly exhausted. I only mumbled this outdated phrase to myself.</p>

It is also heard that on the morning of the 26th of this month at 9:00 am, the third preparatory talk will be held inside the Shen Society at No. 69 Hengmao Lane, opposite the Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Association. Various groups that have already attended have prepared letters in the name of the groups to publicly invite various opera groups that have not yet attended to attend on time to jointly discuss the preparatory steps.</p>
<p>In order to thank all sectors of society for their love and support, the Ziqiang Choral Society has specially printed and sent the lyrics of "Freedom's Sharpshooter," composed by Mr. Sun Shen, the director of the society. If all sectors of society want to request a copy, please send a letter to the 5th floor, No. 115 Hankou Road, Shanghai, and attach a half-cent postage stamp for a return letter.</p>
<p>Movie</p>
<h3>Bai Yushuang Has Never "Been Circled"</h3>
<p>Division Commander Xu Xinyuan came to the governor's office to see Governor Tan Zhiyuan. He smelled the extraordinary aroma of the cigars the governor was smoking. He asked for one to try, but the governor said: "This was sent by the consul. It costs three yuan apiece. I can't let you smoke it." The division commander impolitely reached into the drawer and rummaged around. He found a cigarette case, opened it, and saw that it was full of women's photos, some with circles drawn on them, and some without. The division commander asked curiously, and the governor replied humorously: "The ones with circles are the ones who have been 'circled.'" The clever division commander understood the governor's words: "Hahahaha, that's not bad. Why hasn't Haitanghong (Bai Yushuang) been circled yet?" These words reminded the governor. He immediately called the chief secretary and told him to call Haitanghong, who had not yet been circled. The chief secretary repeatedly agreed and went to carry out the order. The governor proudly praised the chief secretary: "The chief secretary's methods of handling these matters are famous."</p>
<h3>A Trivial Talk on "Going to Nature"</h3>
<p>Due to a kind of pretentious affectation, human nature has long been diminished because of it. In the world, there may still be the existence of rich and poor classes; however, in primitive life, there is only the competition for survival, creating and enjoying by one's own strength.</p>
<p>From the civilized, material world, going to nature, some people will feel that man is a waste, but in the eyes of others, he can use his vitality to resist and overcome this nature.</p>
<p>Essentially speaking, there is no existence of rich and poor classes in the world. That is entirely an artificial affectation; what exists is only the division of intelligence.</p>
<p>"Going to Nature" is written with this theme. We first see people in tall buildings, mansions, brocade clothes, and delicacies; when they go to a deserted island and are completely cut off from the outside world, they cannot tolerate this original life. Because of their own incompetence, they forget the existence of class and succumb to the power of nature. But when they return to civilized society, they immediately forget the lessons of primitive life.</p>
<p>"Going to Nature" does not mean that people should return to nature. Even in a civilized society, this principle can be applied to make this society more natural and more humane, allowing people to obtain their due rewards based on their respective intelligence. Survival of the fittest is the law of nature.</p>
<p>The whole play is completely immersed in a poetic state, but this is not a utopian fantasy; this explains the axiom of natural selection - what kind of existence is mankind.</p>
<h3>Hu Ping Was Scared by the Story of "Midnight Song"</h3>
<p>Xinhua Company's second production, "Midnight Song," is a sad and terrifying sound music epic. Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 pm, the story of the play was told at the company's photography studio. The main actors in the play, such as Hu Ping, Gu Eryi, Gu Menghao, Shi Chao, Li Mingjian, Li Junqing, Chen Yun, etc., all came to listen to the lecture. When director Ma Xuweibang spoke to the exciting part, all the actors and staff present had a psychological fear and listened attentively. Just as the atmosphere was extremely tense, a thunderbolt suddenly extinguished the electric torch, and the entire scene was plunged into darkness, making it even more gloomy and miserable. Moreover, it happened to be raining heavily, and the thunder roared. The actor Hu Ping cried out in fear, and all the actors and staff on the scene felt as if they were in the play, even more frightened and trembling. A worker then brought a candle, and the hearts of the people were slightly calmed. Suddenly, someone among the female stars screamed again: "There's a monster! There's a monster!" Everyone followed and looked, and saw two huge and unparalleled giant eyes flashing in the corner of the room. For a moment, order was disrupted, and everyone wanted to get up and escape. Fortunately, the heavy rain suddenly stopped and the lights came back on. The so-called giant eyes were actually two top lights in the photography studio playing tricks. A moment of worry and surprise finally subsided. Everyone thought that this unexpected and terrifying atmosphere when the story of the play was told must be a symbol of future success.</p>
