<h3>論松井大將之「亞細亞聯盟」說</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>日本松井石根大將日來游覽兩廣會晤華南各政治軍事領袖據其最近談話此行任務乃與中國各領袖討論「亞細亞聯盟」問題氏提倡亞細亞主義爲時甚早而其最近主張中日問題應從亞細亞主義解决彼謂中日爲東方兩大國家應先實行携手謀遠東和平與世界和平而關於亞細亞聯盟之主張亦曾與孫中山先生胡漢民先生等談過云云松井大將之具體意見如何吾人不得而知所謂中日同盟是吾卽廣田三原則中之中日防共軍事同盟及中日僞經濟合作其所謂中日問題從亞細亞主義解决是吾卽廣田三原則中之不許中國引用歐美之力量以爲解决遠東問題之因素？果如是則所謂亞細亞主義無異於亞細亞門羅主義而亞細亞聯盟無異於化全亞細亞爲日本帝國之版圖吾人爲亞細亞民族之一員爲亞細亞運動之最合理領袖鑒於目前形勢及彼國用心對於此種美麗而有毒名實不相符之主張未敢輕示同情也</p>
<p>按亞細亞主義之提倡目的本在於聯合亞洲民族反抗百色人之壓迫求亞洲民族之解放獨立與合作以發揚及恢復亞洲文化之光榮歐洲大戰之前一年日本政論家德富猪一郞卽有「白禍」之宣傳大隈侯亦以爲有色人種必須聯合以抵抗白人日本駐英大使林權助及現財政大臣高橋均主張以中日聯盟爲實現亞細亞聯盟之第一步當美國西部排斥日本及中國僑民最烈之時中日人士對於種族團結之希冀益濃民國十三年孫中山先生由粵赴平道過神戶曾有「大亞細亞主義」之演說對於此主義之發揮極爲警闢中山先生之意亞洲主義應建在亞洲文明之基本精神上卽仁義道德而打破功利强權之覇道觀念中山先生曰大亞細亞主義所求解决之問題卽文化問題東方文化爲王道西方文化爲覇道王道者仁義道德覇道者功利强權言仁義道德當以正義公理戚化他人言功利强權則以洋槍大砲壓迫他人吾人提倡亞洲主義卽爲被壓迫民族打不平以反抗覇道之文化求一切民衆平等解放之文化觀乎此則目前之事實與中山先生之理想其相處之遠更何待言</p>
<p>抑近日日本朝野領袖所以盛言亞細亞主義者其目的不在於亞洲民族之本身而在於歐美列强日本處心積盧者驅歐美諸國之政治的軍事的經濟的及文化的力量於亞洲大陸以外以蘇彝士運河爲日本勢力與歐洲勢力之分界所謂中日同盟爲亞細亞聯盟之始者卽無異言化中國爲日本保護國爲日本統治亞細亞之始也使日本果有意於解放亞洲民族則高麗台灣之民族現狀爲如何耶？使日本果有意於發揚亞洲文化則日本在中國之武力威脅在東四省及冀東之實行奴化敎育何一非覇道何一非「不仁義喪道德」之舉動使日本果有意於亞洲諸民族經濟互助共存共榮則日本在遠東之侵略的對外貿易政策其損人利己之要求與行動何一非宰割亞洲民族以自肥在此種情形之下以談亞細亞主義徒招亞洲民族之怨憤而更顯示日本之詭譎欺人耳</p>

<h3>塞漠生活考察記（十一）</h3>
<p>— 金兌</p>
<p>十三，寗夏中阿朝會的對話和唱歌</p>
<p>敎師：我們的國家是什麼？</p>
<p>學生們：中華民國—世界最古的文明大國。</p>
<p>敎師：我們的宗敎是什麼？</p>
<p>學生們：伊斯唡穆—和平的宗敎。</p>
<p>敎師：我敎的宗旨是什麼？</p>
<p>學生們：普慈—勉人向善，止人爲惡。</p>
<p>敎師：我們對於國家民族和宗敎，應當怎麼樣？</p>
<p>學生們：誓死愛護，絕對不讓人侮損。</p>
<p>敎師：宗敎和國家民族有什麼關係？</p>
<p>學生們：國家和民族是宗敎的外衛；宗敎是國家和民族的內助，相輔而行，不可偏廢。</p>
<p>敎師：穆墾人敎我們每個男女敎徒必須終身求知識，這個「知識」是狹義的呢？還是廣義的呢？</p>
<p>學生們：廣義的—舉凡入生上必需的各種文字和一切科學技能，都包括在內。</p>
<p>敎師：本校的創造者是誰？</p>
<p>學生們：是現任寗夏省政府主席馬少雲。</p>
<p>敎師：馬主席爲什麼勞神焦思，捐廉創辦本校呢？</p>
<p>學生們：爲造就中阿兼通的科學人才，溝通中阿的文化，融洽漢回感情，開發西北，鞏固國防，　揚敎義，愛人救國，實現普慈宗旨。</p>
<p>敎師：我們怎樣貫澈主席的目的呢？</p>
<p>學生們：我們吃苦耐勞，鍜鍊身體，充實精神，敦品好學，期達主席的目的而後已。</p>
<p>上面十項的答間對話，爲寗夏省立第一中阿學校主任蘇　　所編，油印起來分發學生，每决朝會，行禮如儀後，師生循誦一遍。一般回民對宗敎的信仰，有着深固的根蒂，恐怕就是在這時候培植下了的茁苗。而這種對國家民族和宗敎的觀念，還算正確，不是嗎？</p>
<p>相傳回敎始祖穆罕默德的傳道，是左手捧了可蘭經，右手執着利劍的。淸眞敎徒，允其西北各地的回民，持誦他們祖始的經典遺義，都養成了很飽滿很剛强的精神，寗夏省立第一中阿學校，是專爲敎育回民而設的，校中除敎授漢文外，並有阿拉伯和土耳其的經文傳習。寗夏的回民，和別處沒有兩樣，一貫地秉承着好勇的習性，允其是靑年們，學校裏每天都齊集着在引吭高歌，曲譜是鼓舞的，歌聲是雄壯的，那些歌，是現任十五路軍總指揮兼省政府主席馬鴻逵手編的，馬主席亦就是該校的校長，歌詞錄下：</p>
<p>漢回本屬一族，</p>
<p>只因信敎互殊，</p>
<p>遂各分門別戶，</p>
<p>彼此干隔不睦，</p>
<p>致釀慘禍，不一而足。</p>
<p>舊習破除，恢復國族！</p>
<p>舊習破除，恢復國族！</p>
<p>－民族歌－</p>
<p>我穆聖被窮追默地納圍困；</p>
<p>爲自衛，奮起了大無畏尙武精神！</p>
<p>冒矢石，忍傷痛，</p>
<p>不退縮，前進！</p>
<p>寡勝衆，後成功。</p>
<p>又十字軍屢東侵，</p>
<p>終被我忠勇回敎徒，</p>
<p>求自衛，</p>
<p>迎頭打得落花流水齊潰奔。</p>
<p>能自衛，方生存！</p>
<p>拿出這種精神，</p>
<p>保衛祖國。</p>
<p>逐出侵略，莫要過分！</p>
<p>－自衛歌－</p>
<p>十四、寗夏的禮俗－婚喪時令</p>
<p>婚姻禮俗：</p>
<p>媒妁旣通，必取男女年庚對合，無冲尅然後定議，定禮男家用綵幣鐲鏁或梭布簪珥，女家以冠佩或針黹相答，婚期旣定，男家備禮盒酒果，倩賓送期於女家，俗呌「通信」，隨又送朵幣茶果羊酒並衣物首飾至女家，俗稱「下聘」，先期女家備妝奩送男家，俗稱「鋪床」，至吉期，男家又以大蒸饅和果盤，隨綵輿赴女家，俗稱「催妆」。倩女賓替新婦冠挿笄簪，俗稱「冠帶」。女家請女賓隨輿至男家，俗稱「送親」。迎親多用綵轎鼓吹，貧戶用車，世族人家，亦有奠雁親迎的，新婦三日廟謁翁姑，贄以針黹，具酒食，會見族中長幼，俗稱「分大小」，花燭决日，新郞携盒至女家，拜見岳家親族，俗稱「謝親」。新婦親族，亦往答拜。婚姻原不必論財，從前偶有發見，亦不過索聘十數金，近來重聘的風氣大熾，不分貧富，動需百金，甚至因索重聘激成搶親的怪劇。鋪張奢侈，徒然耗費金錢，値今日民窮財盡，若不提倡節的，施行儉樸，勢必奢風日甚，生計枯竭。省府當局鑒此，已計劃先從公務人員遵行，滌除積習，竭力倡率，使民衆漸趨於儉樸，養成廉潔的習俗。</p>
<p>喪葬禮俗：</p>
<p>禮俗最重衰經，　冠履多遵古制，麻巾衰衣必大祥後始易，惟期功以下，近亦多就簡便，未能盡如古禮，七日行大殮，親友多會吊，葬前一日，親友各持奠儀往祭，喪家備酒食相酬，每進食羹，孝子必出稽顙，謝禮甚煩瑣，贏弱的往往憊累不支。中衛，靈武等縣，俗例尤尙送葬，男女多至數十百人，喪家為了要備辦酒食車乘，自顧力薄不能辦的，竟或留殯數十年不敢舉喪。相傳明季近邊各堡，　虜常伺葬出刦衣物，所以葬時必多請姻戚以爲準備，迄今數百年的備虜故事，却變了喪家的煩累，這可算是一椿笑話了。</p>
<p>時令禮俗：</p>
<p>「元旦」早起，正衣冠，燃香燭，拜天地先祖，卑幼拜尊長，出賀親友，俗稱「拜年」。預爲三日炊，俗稱「年飯」。四日方更炊生米，三鼓，熾鐵或炭，盛在盆上，取醋淋沃，一面繞着屋裏行，一面嘴裏說着吉利語，除　不祥，到大門外邊覆着，俗呌「打醋　」，又稱「送五窮」。五日黎明，灑掃地上雜沓的積穢，備香表舉着送出街外，鄉村却要送到大路上，俗亦稱「送五窮」，這天拘忌得很，要不是至戚，不相往來的，七日黃昏後，稚男幼女懷餅焚香，赴街相呼，鄉村就在門外呼喚，或食麵餅擊銅器相呼，俗稱「招魂」。「上元」食元宵，前後三夜，街市都張着綵燈，有閣燈，牌燈，亭燈，鱉山燈等名色，以紙糊製，近亦有用玻璃燈的，照徹通衢，有如白畫，觀衆很擠擁。更預先用泥塑秦槍夫婦像，陳放在通衢大道上，泥像中空，裏邊裝滿柴炭，整天燒着，俗呌「燒秦槍一。至夜，婦女羣往遊觀，都伸手摸秦像的長舌和臂足，俗稱「遊百病」。上元前後四五日，由人們扮成五色花臉或高脚的士地神，另一人化裝婦人，手持掃帚前行，亦是掃除不祥的意思，嗚鑼擂鼓，在街道游行，俗呌「社賀」。二十三夕，家戶堆蒺藜在門外，用火焚燒，撒灑鹽粒，老幼跳越，俗呌「燎疳」。火滅揚灰，俗呌「六穀花」，占算豐年。二月二日，家戶炒豆黍麵麥各樣的花，喫下肚裏，俗稱「炸臭蟲」。這天，將元旦所做爐餅，齊集了全家老幼，在庭中進食，俗呌「團圓餅」，取一年團圓的好意。二月上丁後至淸明，擇吉臼具牲醴載紙標往祭墓，呌做「修治先瑩」。三月二十八日，東門外的東嶽廟會，前後三日，市中擺賣百貨，扶老携幼，絡繹於道，晋香的固然很多，遊觀的亦自不少，很是鬧熱，道途擁塞。四月朔八日，西門外上塔寺的洗祓會，老魷男女，　集途中，有逾東嶽。八日諸寺僧尼舉行浴佛會，婦女俱往膜拜。「端午」貼符挿菖蒲艾葉，飲雄黃酒啖角黍，並以綵絲作符，剪艾虎相餽送，五月六日，相傳是日儲水作麵，經月不腐，孟秋「七夕」，閨中少女陳針工茗果，作乞巧會，亦有羣衆歌舞的，俗稱「跳巧」。望七日，北門外的賓塔會，遊客很多，「中秋」祀月，備月餅，設瓜果，家家如是，餅筵瓜市，擺遍了廣衢大巷，中秋節家有孕婦的，閨裏用祀月的瓜，從中信手切如雉堞形，遇單成男，遇雙成女，以卜生兆。「重陽」食糕飲菊酒，亦有爲登高會的。季秋九日釀酒，呌做「電陽酒」，這個月裏頭，採蔬鹽漬，以備冬食。「冬至」日，祀先祖，家人親友相拜賀，取肉雜粉腐做羹，和酒啜食，俗呌「頭腦酒」，冬至一陽生，取作事有頭腦的意思。「臘八」煮粥雜以豆肉，名呌「臘八粥」。這個月初旬，取水釀成酒，名呌「臘酒」。二十三夜，以雞酒餅飴祀竃。雞陳而不殺，至除夕，始薦熟，名呌「接竃」。「除歲」之夕貼春聯，易門神，具酒餚，祀先祖，拜尊長，焚香爆竹，燃燈澈夜，俗呌「守歲」。是夕閨裏人以棗柿芝蔴及雜菜堆滿盞著茶葉，奉翁姑及尊客，俗呌「稠茶女筵」，以爲持敬，新婦拜見舅姑，針工外允重此，多者至百餘盞，一盞費數十錢，相傳始於明王府，至今不改。</p>

<h3>戰時意大利的一瞥（下）　－殺氣籠罩下的歐局觀察之三－</h3>
<p>— Lluis　Fisher作　賓符譯</p>
<p>米蘭是意大利北部最大的工業城，人口九十萬。這可以說是法西斯主義的母家。那最重耍的法西斯日報不在羅馬而在米蘭出版，如墨沙里尼手創的「意大利人民報」，現在由他的姪兒編輯着；還有Corrierre　della　Sera那著名的蓋達（Gayda），每天在這報上嘲諷着不列顚。米蘭的法西斯黨人還有他們的「標貼」語，他們用鉛筆在破紙上塗寫。他們寫若什麼W　II　Duce（墨沙里尼萬歲）M　Dden（艾登快死）M　L’Inghilterra（英國快亡）等。我曾看到「艾登快死」兩次；看到「Negus快死」兩次，（Negus就是阿比西尼亞王）——阿王據說是不大被注意的；看到「英國該死」一次。有時我又在壁上或標語上看到W．Binda。後來我問了別人，纔知道Binda原來是一個脚踏車賽錦標的獲得者。</p>
<p>標語成了現代羅馬的流行物，但是誰也看不到一九一九年曾經發現過的「列寗萬歲」或「斯太林萬歲」或「莫斯科萬歲」的標語。那墨沙里尼自翊竹從他們手巾救出意大利的數百萬共產黨和革命者到那裏去了呢？有許多是被「肅淸」，拘囚，或放逐了。有許多是完全改變了。那至今未改的也許恐懼着或期待着他們的時機。在寡頭統治之下，無組織的反對是不能見效的。理智有時統制着政治的鬬爭，把共產黨的口號寫在法西斯的宣傳單上，這顯得還是太早。</p>
<p>法西斯蒂正想利用仇英和制裁的每個機會。以後如果經濟上發生了大困難，那不該怪法西斯主義或戰爭，而應當惟英國和日內瓦是問。下面一段法西斯黨團在標語上誡吿公民的話，是到處可以看到的。</p>
<p>「米蘭人，在世界大戰的第十七周年中，我們見到無產的法西斯的意大利已經起來，已經集結於她的國王和她的首相之下了；她對生存的神聖權利的防護是無敵的，她求勝利的决心也是無敵的。士兵們，黑衫黨員，米蘭人！當意大利在世界大戰中受了六十七萬死亡和四十萬創傷的損失後，日內瓦就發動巨大的制裁機構，加危我們對於「太陽下地面」的征服。反抗這種對我們的生存和威信的進攻！爲了正義和文化，讓我們加强我們堅决不撓的意志。意大利萬歲，我皇萬歲，首相萬歲。</p>
<p>一隊水手拖着幾架輕便的大砲在路上經過，由一黑衫黨員在前面領導着，他吹着哨子以引起人們的注意。只有一個老人在舉手行「愷撤」式的敬禮。過路的羣衆却並不駐足注視。一般的說，誰也不曾感覺到空氣的緊張。四周毫無戰爭的空氣。到邊境時我的行李沒有被啟視，邊境當局和旅館檢查員也並不怎麼注意我的護照。在敎堂的廣塲上，有一隊的莫二十們的法西黨人，穿着各色各樣的制服，腿部佩着短劍，肩上披了大氅，在那裏閒行，——早上我就看見了他們，直到我長途繞行邊境回來時還是看見這「原班人馬」。他們除了吸引人們注意或互相打諢外，似乎毫無事事。他們笑着，吸着烟，有時大家互相在背部扭毆着，只有他們的軍裝也許會使人想到意大利是在從事戰爭了——常然不是由於他們的態度。我所得的印象是法西斯黨人或甚至全國的民衆仍把這决的征阿當作一種大規模的國家「野宴」「Picnic。他們並不加以重視。其賓這還只是困難的開端呢。</p>
<p>今天我跟一個大紡織業家談話。他說米蘭大部份紡織廠所有的棉料存貨是不能再維持一個月了。他們目前無從得到新的供給。政府所有的外國通貨和金子都用於貯藏大量的石油。米蘭附近的一家氈帽廠，所有原料只能維持兩星期。羊毛和棉花都不能大量地輸入了。我又問他關於法西斯合作組織的情形。「那是絕不可靠的」，他回答說，「墨沙里尼只想用這當作威脅來控制我們罷了。國家管理是苛刻的，但是我們的資本終究是我們自己的啊。」無論如何，他是個激烈的反法西斯者。他痛恨着這種統制。他預言制裁在最近的將來必將引起嚴重的失業。</p>
<p>政府正鼓動着人民募集一筆百分之五的新戰債。有一張募債標語畫了一個帶若拿破崙帽穿着釘鞋的負槍兵士。他正看守着阿比西尼亞士地上的一具犂鋤。還有一張描述一個帶了許多犂鋤的兵士。這用意就是吿訴人民說那東菲的遠征軍是不再回來了。他們將留着耕種阿比西尼亞的田地，因此意大利的人口過剩也就得了救濟了。這可還得等着瞧。白入在熱帶菲洲的大規模殖民，還不曾有過先例呢。第三張的勸債標語，則是一個意大利軍官同他那當着童子軍的兒子行禮，這標語的意思就是說，「爲了你的孩子們，捐助些吧！」</p>
<p>過了工作時間我跑到影戲院。影戲院是漆黑的，因此，人們在裏面儘可以自由表示他們的感情。第一幕放映的是新聞片。一艘滿載兵士的輪船啟程駛到以里特利亞去。全院觀衆沒有人拍手。坦克車向阿斯瑪拉一座小山衝上去，沒有人拍手。德波諾將軍在阿杜瓦附近檢閱意大利軍隊，有一個人拍了會手，但突然靜默之後，接着便是一陣尖銳的喧鬧，這實在比沒有喝采還不如。兵士們把他們所得的薪資寄回家來。沒有人拍手。</p>
<p>我問一個意大利的藝術家爲什麼不到阿此西尼亞去。他說，「讓別人去戰吧」。我又把同一問題問一旅館的職員。他說，「讓那些沒有事的人去打仗吧」。他以爲戰爭是正同一種公共工程一樣。全國人民對於戰爭似乎都很少熱心。制裁和全世界國家的反對使法西斯蒂趁機鼓起了全國的愛國在熱。但是兩個月來的制裁和油禁的可能却已使法西斯蒂膽寒了。</p>

<h3>粵敎廳　推行義敎概况</h3>
<p>（廣州通信）粵省當局、近年實施三年計劃、於政治　經濟。敎育各方面、均有顯著之進步、其中義務敎育方面、允積極推行、項據敎育廳長黃麟書氏、詳述敎育廳一年　推行義務敎育情形、爰摘要紀錄如下、</p>
<p>黃氏認爲目前中國敎育大計、首重義敎之普及、故自彼長敎廳以後、第一問題、乃爲如何推行義敎、以期普遍、查粵省於民國十七年、已沒有義務敎育委員會、籌劃一切實施義敎事官、惟因經費及各種關係、未能切實推進、依過去統計、二十年全省小學校數爲一萬八千九百六十九間、學生數爲一百零九萬八千九百六十五人、迨三年計劃貫施以後、二十三年小學校數增至一萬二千七百五十四間、學生數增至百十六萬九千四百零六人、與二十年相較、學校數實增三千七百八十五間學生數實增三十七萬零四百四十一人、若以百分率計、學校數增加率爲百分之十九、學生數增加率爲百分之一十三、此種增加率、雖差强人意、然距普及義務之理想尙遠故於二十四年春初、統籌全局、縝密計劃擬定省庫補助貧瘠縣分辦理義敎辦法、先擇素稱貧瘠之縣份如感恩·冒江·陵水·安會·防城·靈山·徐聞·連山·陽山·乳源·翁源·佛岡·開建·封川·新豐·和平·連平·豐順·南澳·寶安。等二十縣、每縣補助開　縣立普通小學（四年制）二校、一校辦兩班、用多級複式敎學制、一校辦一班、用單級複式敎學制、辦多級者、設校長兼敎員一人、敎員二人、辦單級者、設校長兼敎員一人、計校長兼敎員月薪三十五元、敎員月薪三十元、均由省庫支給、衹每校開辦費、（單級一百四十元多級二百二十元）及每月辦公費、（單級六元六角多級十元）始由各縣自籌、其特別貧瘠之縣分、即開辦費亦由省庫補助、計二十四年春設之省庫補助普通小學四十間、補助費的三萬二千元、其師資亦由敎廳就省立小學敎員訓練所及各師範畢業生選派之、</p>
<p>此種補助辦法、施行數月、頗感適合地方需要、不無相當成績、因復定於二十四年夏、將補助經費增至十二萬餘元、將補助縣份擴爲四十縣、除原所擇定之二十縣外、加人儋縣·崖縣·萬寗·瓊東·臨高·欽縣·吳川·遂溪·赤溪·高明·德慶·鬱南·仁化·始興·龍門·龍川·紫金·平遠·惠來·花縣。等二　縣、一面將前所補助之初級小學繼續辦理、而將地辦一班者、改辦兩班、以廣收容、一面爲求易於普及、每縣補助開辦短期小學四校、施行一年制之短期義務敎育、使一般未就學之學齡兒童、及年長失學兒童、皆有享受敎育之機會、除原辦普通小學四十間外、短期小學一百六十間、</p>
<p>民國二十叫年秋、敎育部嚴令各省遵照新頒實施義敎辦法、依期推行、會撥發中央補助，粵省義敎經費十三萬元、內有一萬二千元給與廣州市區、其餘十二萬元（則分配爲五十號、（即除上述儋縣等二十縣外、再加定安·澄邁·化縣·廢江。電白信宜羅定。陽春雩浮。新興·四會·廣寗·恩半·鶴山·三水·從化·英德·連縣·南雄·樂昌·增城·博羅·河源·普寗·海豐·强豐·五華·蕉嶺·饒平·大埔。等三十縣。）共補助開設短期小學二百五十間、其補助辦法、大致向前、而塋縣等二十縣、每縣尙須山地方自行籌辦短期小學三校、定安等二十縣、每縣尙須由地方自行籌辦十校、至南海。番禺。等二十四縣、較爲富飽、省庫母庸補助、每縣須由地方自行籌辦十五校、統計令省於二十四年度內、必須開設之短期小學一千一百三十校、另普通小學十校、除由省庫及中央欽補助外、其由縣自籌者、共五十餘萬元云云、查粵省推行義敎工作、一年內即有若斯之成績、實爲一般人初所未料者也。</p>

<p>兄弟今天同諸位談談新生活與民族復興的關係、在道國難異常嚴重的時期、我們國家在國際上的地位是四面楚歌、我們的民族、就像是乘了隻破漏的在驚濤駭浪的大海中掙扎、時時都有沉沒的危險、這樣危難的時期、我們應當如何的努力來復興我們的民族鞏固我們的國家、凡屬國民每個人都有責任、同時也就是人人皆有的志願、民族復興的重要途徑、總理在民族主義中曾經顯示給我們是要恢復民族道德振作民族精神、假如民族精神頹靡、民族道德淪亡、即令有嚴密的政治措施物質建設、法嚴弊多、也是無濟於事、民族道德之復興、民族精神之振作、併不是政治法律所能爲力、是要民族自身的覺醒、同時也就是民族每一份子自身的覺醒、必須要每一國民感到我們的民族國家前途的艱險、人人自己奮發努力振作、然後民挨精神才能振乍起來、自奮自發的途徑是什麼吃、實行新生活便是奮發的途徑、所以我們說實行新生活是振作民族精神恢復民族道德的基本、同時也就是民族復興的基本、說到新生活、我們得再加一番解釋、所謂生活、即是人與人之間過日子的方式、所謂新者、並非買來借來從外國帶來、祗是一種洗除舊染惡習、重新做個頂天立地的好人的意思、所謂以前種種譬如昨日死、以後種種譬如今日生、這便是實行新生活的决心表示、管子說、禮義廉恥、國之叫維、四維不張、國乃滅亡、這是我們的古聖光賢所指示給我們的與亡大道、我們現在要復興我們的民族、拯救我們的國家、便須從根本做起、把民族的道德禮義恥四維建樹起來、人人努力振作、共同奮鬥、甚麼是禮、禮　是社會生活的秩序、我們歷代的政治、多是用禮敎民、使國民生活有一定的秩序、假如禮法不明則社會秩序大亂、國亦隨亡、故詩經上說、「相鼠有體、人而無禮、胡不遄死、」曲禮說、「鸚鵡以敎人、使人以有禮、自知別於禽獸、」又云、「人有禮則安、無禮則危、富貴而知好禮則不驕不淫貧賤而知好禮則志不懾、孔子解釋禮說、禮者何也即事之治也、君子有其事必有其治、治國而有求於幽室之中、非燭何見、若無禮則手足無所措、耳目無所加、進退揖讓無所制、是故以之居處、長幼失其別、閨門三族失其和、朝廷官爵失其序、田獵戎事失其策、軍旅武功失其象、味失其時、樂失其節、車失其式、鬼神失其饗、喪紀失其哀、辨說失其黨、官失其體、政事失其施、加於身而錯於前、凡衆之動失其宜、由此我們可以說禮法是政治和社會生活的要素、現在我們所要注重的禮法、便是守秩序、重職責、求整齊、重紀律、守信用、愛國家、其次再說到義義是甚麼、義是人事的是非、是人心的公理、孟子說、「義者宜也、」又說、「是非之心義之端也、」所以合義不合義、便是事之常爲不當爲、假若是常作之事、即令是萬分爲難也要作到、若是不當作之事、即令是有刀架在脖子上、槍刺在胸脯前也不能做、所以古人說「捨生取義、」從來的忠臣烈士都是從一個義字上得來、在我們現在民族國家如此危險的時期我們的國民對認於義字的認識是尤其要注重涵養、這是在復興民族拯救國難上不視的、眞正能够慷慨就義的人便是平日的生活可忽修養的人、共决再說到廉、在現在社會經濟恐慌、物質享樂的引誘力極大的環境之下、廉潔的修養、最不容易、古人云、「臨財母苟得、致難母苟免、」所謂臨財母苟得、」便是廉「臨雞母苟免」便是義了、在當兮之世、我們試看臨財能不苟得、臨難能不苟免的人眞是很少很少、所以社會不安都由於此、我們要修養廉潔、便須在勤儉上用工夫、古人云、「儉以養廉、」假如物質的享受不奢靡、廉潔的德性、自然是會養成的、再决便說到恥、國恥暫且不說、先設個人的自身問題、一個假如不知羞恥則將爲非作歹、無所不爲、出賣人格、出費民族、出賣國家、即受世人唾駡亦聒不知恥、假若多有如此國民、直是亡國減種有餘、故廉恥對於民族的德性、其關係叉何等重大、綜上以觀、我們要復興民族、首要的工作便是先從自身修養、要修養禮義廉恥的好道德、必須注重日常生活、從整齊、忠實、勇敢、勤儉、守秩序、重信用、各方四去下工夫、須要人人實行革去偷惰浪漫隨意貪奢的惡習、從新做起、我們的民族才能復興、我們的國家才能有望、新生活運動、本身就是一個敎育、故我們從事於敎育工作的人、主首先實行新生活、（完）</p>

<h3>江蘇省立鎭江鄕區衛生實騐區工作概况（一）</h3>
<p>— 朱雲達</p>
<p>成立經過</p>
<p>蘇省近年來，對地方衛生行政，策劃改進，不遺餘力，如縣衛生事業的整頓，縣立醫院的增加，縣衛生敎育指導員的設置，都是很顯明的事實。允其對於鄉村衛生的推進，具有極大的準備和决心，執政者常感覺我國鄉村衛生行政設施的方法，還在創造，究竟用如何方案設施，纔能適合我國鄉村社會的需耍。民政廳於去年八月，有省立鎮江鄉區衛生實騐區的設置，求謀於相當時間內，實騐出一個適用於江蘇省鄉村社會的衛生行政方案來，作全省鄉村衛生行政推進的楷模。擬製江蘇省衛牛實騐區組織規程，經臨預算，及工作計劃大綱，經省府會議通過後，委雲達為鎭江鄉區衛生實騐區主任，並聘胡定安氏為技術總指導，設辦事處於鎭江第四區諫壁鈸，於九月一日正式成立。</p>
<p>諫壁的情形</p>
<p>初期設施，以諫壁月湖江山等鄉爲範圍，將來擬逐漸推廣，擴大到　江全縣的鄕區。</p>
<p>諫壁離省會十三公里，東靠大港，西近丹徒，鎮澄公路汽車，經過此地，交通還算便利，共有一千三百三十八戶，人口共五千七百六十三人，月湖鄉有七百九十五戶，共三千零零一人，江山鄉六百十五戶，共二千三百三十七人，總共人口一萬一千九百零一人，而識字的，祇有三千九百二十五人，人民敎育程度的低微，可以想見，風氣閉塞，迷信很深，鎮上及附近幾十里內，無一新醫，有病則求神拜佛，信巫跳鬼，誤死的很多，飲料水大部分仰給於可水，有井的人家很少，河水都不淸潔，一邊在挑水洗菜淘米，一邊在刷馬桶倒穢水，這已成爲常事，諫壁的街道溝渠，說來更可怕，西南北三街很短，東街略長，因年久失修，都淤塞不通，居民日常所有穢水，無法排泄，沿門亂傾，汚泥水塘，觸目皆是，過到雨天，便變成澤國，有許多農家，猪圈做在家裏，糞坑放在門前，屋不開窗，進門漆黑一團，灰堆和灶在一起，齷齪不甚，象這種情形，衛生設施的需要性，固然很大，但對象複雜，積習過深，進行也就格外的感覺困難了。</p>
<p>實騐的宗旨</p>
<p>我覺得對象兪壞，困難愈多，像諫壁這樣的環境，愈能體騐出一個非常的方案來。於是，我們便不怕難，全體工作人員，共同決定了一個工作實騐的宗旨。</p>
<p>實騐的宗旨，是要敎人民「自動」的起來注意衛生，知道衛生，改善自己的生活環境，增進自己的健康，絕對不敎人民做「被動」，初起不能完全「自動」的時候，至少我們要有「推動」的能力，促起他們「自動一接受保健的方法，提高他們愛潔的心理，同時，敎入民逐漸的把迷信費用，移用到衛生事業上來，我們除掉政府按月發給的行政費之外，一切衛生設施，不向政府請求事業費，以鄉區人民的能力財力，來辦理鄉區人民的健康事業，假如一年半後，我們的工作能依期完成的話，我們便離開此地，將辦事處遷設其也鄉鎭，這時，諫壁鄉區的衛生事業，便交給諫壁地方人士辦理，劃諫壁爲「衛生自治區一這是我們最後的目的。</p>
<p>實騐的方式</p>
<p>實騐的方式，分個人家庭公共三形式，每一種皆抓住了一個重心，做推進的原動力，個人衛生以兒童爲重心，家庭衛生以婦女爲重心，公共衛生以成年男子爲重心，在兒童時期，能養成完善的衛生習慣，將來便可以成爲一個健康的國民，在現實社會裏，婦女成爲家庭中的中堅，要是把衛生知識充分灌輸到她們的腦海裏，得到她們的同情，得到她們的帮助，她們能以身作則，去改善家庭，則家庭衛生的推進，便成爲一伴容易的事了，我們在四個月工作中，已得不少的效果，我們自信，以婦女推進家庭衛生爲重心，是很對的，公共衛生以成年男子爲重心，對成年男子灌輸公共衛生知識，增進對公共衛生的觀念，則辦理公共衛生的時候，障碍便少，我們根據這三種方式，抓住了三個重心，向認定的目標，努力邁進。</p>
<p>求在一年六個月的時期中，完成我們的使命，現在已做了四個月的工作。</p>
<h3>論中國主體之醫藥建設（上）</h3>
<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>舊醫藥科學化　新醫藥中國化</p>
<p>余論中國醫藥建設，必以中國爲主體，凡以中國爲主體之醫藥建設事業，必須認定二點，一曰新醫藥中國化，二曰舊醫藥科學化，請申言之：</p>
<p>曷言乎舊醫藥科學化？舊醫藥之爲人唾棄久矣！其被唾棄之原因，主要在不合科學，然其歷史近數千年，其書籍都數萬冊，前人之心思日力消耗於此者，誠不知其若干輩，其中果一無可取耶？卽不視爲治病之醫學，亦當視爲國故之一種，夫陰陽五行之說玄談也，左肝右胃之說妄測也，此皆不合科學者也，然而金針之治療，適合於內分泌之學術，對症治療時合於外國之順勢療法（Homeopathy）吾深覺夫舊醫之學術，似有去取與整理之必要，其不合於科學者含而棄之，其近於科學或暗合於科學者益科學之，若一切棄去而無所擇焉者似太過矣！至於國產藥物，確多可用之原料，此已有事實證明，「日人提鍊都無可取」之說，殆爲不見經傳之談，若能用科學方法，一一加以化騐，則可用者甚多，又不僅小補而已！夫科學者實本求是之謂也。以精密之方法而求得正確之眞理是也，吾所謂舊醫藥科學化者，卽　去其　　，　於實　，以　　之方法，分祈其確　　騐之良方，　　其紛如亂絲之　　，其於　　於文　不　有補乎？然此决非普通　醫所　爲，以　　　知科　爲　　　，亦非　　新醫所不爲，以舊醫　文字奧衍不易讀也，必也博通中西醫學而又　於中國文字者而後能　任愉快，此吾所謂舊醫藥科學化　。</p>
<p>曷言　新醫　之中國化？新醫藥者科學醫藥也，科學無國界，故新醫藥爲世界所公有，非一國之所能專，新醫藥而曰中國化，驟觀之似近於矛盾矣！然細思之，實有至理存焉！一國有一國之特點，猶一人有一人之個性也，言文學藝術者，以能表現其個性爲佳，言政治設施者以不泯滅其民族之特點爲善；我之所以爲我而不同化於人者，其關鍵全在此也，新醫學之輸入中國，已百年矣！然而社會稱之曰「西醫」，政府亦稱之曰「西醫」；卽新醫界自身亦有自稱「西醫」者，老子曰：「名者實之賓也」，卽共名觀之，中國之醫學其不能表現個性也亦可見矣！醫界如此，故醫學醫業終無獨立之可能；政府如此，故醫政醫育，動受鄰邦之牽制，然則以中國爲本位，而建設中國之新醫，庸非當前之急務乎？建設之道，請分四點言之：一曰：醫學之本國主體化，地球之上，有東西焉！有水陸焉！有寒帶熱帶溫帶焉！有黃種白種焉！同居天地之內，同爲頂趾之民，因地域，氣候，種族之不同，人民之體質遂不能無稍差異，其所生之病症亦遂不能完全相同，有世界所公有之病，亦有一地域所專有之病，更有同一病而中西症狀不同之病；不觀夫歐西各國之醫籍乎？其所臚列之病症，大抵皆以彼邦所常見者爲主體，非然者則歧視之曰外方病（Maladies　exotiques）中國所常見之病症如瘧如痢，皆彼所稱外方病也，吾國學者不深究其故，亦隨聲附和之曰外方病，豈自居於外方耶？甚矣其瞢於主客之勢也，夫在彼則曰外方，在我則爲主體，立塲不同，本位自異，然則歐西醫藉，其不完全吻合於吾國所有之病症明矣，乃吾國醫學校所用之敎材，非爲原文之西書，卽爲直譯之課本，而敎授之者又多口操外語，學生讀書於學校之中，已自忘其以中國爲主體之義，及其出而問世，無怪乎冠以日德英美之名，而互相是非，互相標榜於中國之醫界也，吾以爲欲建設中國主體之新醫學，必先從事於廣收中國病症之材料，以科學之方法，記錄其症狀，觀察其癥結尋溯其病因，研究其療法，以爲編訂中華病症全書之預備，同時將現在通行之各譯本，重加審核，以中國病爲主體，以中國語敎授之，他如學術討論之語言文字，亦以中文爲主，如是則主體之義明而不致反主作客矣！不寗惟是，中西人民因風俗環境之不同，其飲食上之習慣亦每不能無異，西人之食譜，往往有不盡適合於華人之習慣者，平居且然，况有疾乎？若以其平日所不習慣之飲食，進於其生病之時，不亦有圓鑿方柄之嫌耶？此適合中國病人習慣之食譜所以必須重製也。總之，研究病症，編製書籍，重訂食譜，皆爲建設中國新醫學必耍之工作，此其一。</p>
<h3>早產兒保育法之科學的新知見</h3>
<p>— 瞿紹衡</p>
<p>男女媾精。胎孕自成。胎兒寄居母體。資其發育。溯自受孕以至成熟。凡四十星期。卽二百八十日。故普通多以十月計之也。惟依產科學上言之。娩產時期。則別爲流產，早產，正期產及晚產四種。凡姙娠二十八星期以前產生者。曰流產。二十九星期以後。三十八星期以前產生者。曰早產。三十九乃至四</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>十星期產生者。曰正期產。四十星期以後產生者。曰晚產。茲所謂早產兒者。卽指姙娠期未滿。胎兒發育未全而產生之嬰兒也。蓋早產兒之身體發育不全。身長體重均較小。體內臟器發育不良。呼吸作用體溫調節作用等。均甚孱弱。哺乳消化作用等。亦皆不全。故其保育之法。殊爲困難。曩者，對於早產兒之保育方法。不外左述三點。</p>
<p>第一　防止體溫下降。以補體溫調節之不足。</p>
<p>第二　補助其呼吸中樞興奮力之薄弱。</p>
<p>第三　對於哺乳力嚴加注意。務使忍性耐勞。增多其哺乳量。以防營養之不足。</p>
<p>其中關於第一項補助體溫調節之法。有各種保溫裝置。名曰溫槽。其形式雖頗不一。然搆造大抵相同。槽之四週重壁。間注溫水。利用燈火，電氣。另附調節裝置。以使器內空氣溫度。常保攝氏二六——二八度之間。其無此項設備者。則以全身多包棉花或傍置熱水袋湯婆子等法代之。</p>
<p>關於第二項鼓舞呼吸作用之法。除沿用之皮膚刺戟，溫浴等機械的或溫熱的方法外。更有「樂佩靈」Lo　belin「維他康福」Vitacamphor「可拉明」Coramin等特殊藥品。</p>
<p>惟對於第三項營養問題。則除注意哺乳之看護。忍性耐勞。促進哺乳力。增加哺乳量外。尙未聞有別種藥品或治療法之報吿也。綠早產兒之吸啜力。通常非常微弱。甚有完全缺如者。故負有維持其營養之責者。必須具有充分之忍耐力。譬如以少量母乳。頻頻授予。其無力吸啜者。以唧筒吸出後直接注入口中。或以導胃管將乳汁注入胃囊。且早產兒體重之生理的初期减少。（一則由於大小便之排泄，一則由於營養物之少攝，）實較成熟兒爲多。而恢復生產當時體重之時期。亦較爲遲緩。故當世學者。莫不窮思極索。以期有防止生理的體重减少。至少亦須有早復產生當時體重之妙藥。則對於早產兒之保育。庶幾有濟。近年以來。賀蒙療法。日有進步。殆有百病可治。用無不效之妙。對於早產兒保育方面。亦可以此彌補空前之缺陷。</p>
<p>上項賀蒙療法。大別爲二種。一爲膵臟賀蒙卽因素靈與葡萄糖之併用療法。一爲性賀蒙療法。之二者。實爲適合於保育早產兒之新療法也。惟其療法。因本刊限於篇幅。不及備載。欲知詳細。請閱診療醫報第八卷第六期。</p>
<h3>起死回生（上）</h3>
<p>— 月祺</p>
<p>——醫學故事之十八——</p>
<p>在一間潔凈而淸靜的實騐室中，三個穿白長衫的靑年站在手術檯的週圍。在檯布上，躺着一隻完全健康的獵犬。三人中的一人把一隻面罩放在獵犬的口部，另一人旋開氮氣箱的開關，用管子和面罩相接把這氣體注入獵犬口中。不多久，獵犬呆住不動了。牠的肌肉弛鬆。顯然那獵犬是被悶斃了。</p>
<p>於是，穿白長衫的三個靑年立刻忙亂着收拾皮下注射針和盛在用木塞緊藏的小瓶內的奇異的藥水。四分鐘過去了。三人中的一人看看他的錶。另一人用注射針抽取瓶內的藥水，把針刺入那死犬的胸部，有到針的尖端接觸牠的心臟。一個氧氣面罩給放在牠的口上。</p>
<p>隨着試騐者的用力，那死犬的神經和肌肉也變得緊張起來。三人中的一人把聽胸器放在牠的胸部，按耳靜聽一回，不禁發出一聲驚喊。那心臟開始跳動了。那獵犬，死了已四分鐘，又活過來了。過一二天，牠會喫食。過若干星期，牠將又照常走路，跑路，游嬉，和服從主人的命令了。</p>
<p>以上所述，是美國加里福尼亞州的一位靑年科學家考納西博士（Dr．Robert　E.Cornish）新近在他的實騐室中從事「起死回生」的考騐的情形。雖然試騐的對象只因窒悶而死的人也可以同樣容易地給復活過來。在巴耳的摩耳，在克里佛蘭，在蘇聯，在瑞士，從事別種研究的共他科學家亦如是預言着。他們說，總有一天，被稱爲往古奇蹟的「起死回生」將藉科學的恩賜而重現於世上。</p>
<p>在蘇聯，有人利用勃魯克漢寗可博士（Dr．Serge　Brukhanenko）所發明的人造心臟把自縊而死的一個人的生命挽回過來，雖然時間非常短暫。自縊後三小時，醫生宣吿他確實死了，屍體給送到實騐室中去。醫生切開一枝動脈和一枝靜脈；在割裂處挿入從人造心臟通出來的管子。電氣馬達給開動着，滂浦趕回靜脈管內的黑血。黑血通過人造脈臟的時候，不潔的成分被排除，同時吸收新鮮的氧氣。另一滂浦把這新鮮血液注入動脈管中。慢慢地，身體細胞吸收着給予生命的氧氣，那自殺者終於張開眼睛，看看他身傍的醫生，不開口也不動彈，像一個呆子的樣子。可是，只過了兩分鐘，那生命的火星仍然熄滅了。</p>
<p>去年一月間，在波耳的摩耳地方的公立醫院中，一個女病入躺在手術檯上。實習生突然呌喊着說，那病人的脈搏完全停止了。外科醫生從已切開的裂縫伸入他的手，用手指握住那靜止不動的心臓。他交替地把心臟一擠一放，使血液流通她的全身。過了一會，那心臟終於自動地跳動，那婦人居然復活過來了。</p>
<p>在瑞士日內瓦地方，一個固執的醫生屢决就溺斃或因電震而死的人作試騐。脈搏完全停止了，其他生命的標記也都沒有了。他輕輕地按摩死者的心臟。在多數例子中，過了十分鐘或十五分鐘，靜止的心臟重又跳動，死者便得再生。在其他地方，用這方法使死者重生的例子亦復不少。</p>
<h3>疾病常識問題</h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（七十九）貧血（Anaemia）</p>
<p>（問）什麼呌做貧血？</p>
<p>（答）貧血就是身體內的血液量减少或血色素缺乏的病變；俗名血虧。</p>
<p>（問）貧血的原因，緊要關鍵在什麼地方？</p>
<p>（答）貧血的原因，不外乎二種：（一）是紅血球的崩壞劇甚，（二）造血作用的减退。</p>
<p>（問）貧血可以分做幾類？</p>

<h3>牙齒常識問答（二十一）</h3>
<p>— 林鑑賢</p>
<p>（第一〇七問）嬰兒的口腔，怎樣使之淸潔？</p>
<p>答　應該用淸潔的紗布，剪成許多的小方塊，浸在百分之二的硼酸水中。要用時取二三塊，把嬰兒口腔，上下右左，都揩拭周遍。凡嬰兒食後，必須揩一次，牙肉上允須多擦，這種方法，旣可以防止各種口炎喉炎，又可刺激乳牙的生長，减少出牙時的脹痛。。</p>
<p>（第一〇八問）　小兒的口腔。在出牙時期，應該怎樣注意？</p>
<p>答　如出牙感覺困難時，應該把上述蘸過藥水的紗布，在出牙部分牙肉，多加磨擦。如乳牙仍延遲不出，脹痛不安，應該請牙醫生把牙肉切開，則出牙自易。吾則如杲出牙痛苦，任其延長，小兒易致發熱不安，並易惹起頑固之胃腸病。</p>
<h3>肺結核淺說（八三）</h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>第六節　專門性的刺激治療——鐵勃固靈</p>
<p>怎樣呌對症療法呢？尋常對於每一種病症，根據他發生的病因而設法驅除之，例如傳染病之殺其病原菌，謂之」「原因療法」。此種名符其實的藥劑，謂之特効藥　例若規寗之於瘧症是。如果對於此種病症無原因療法之特効藥時，那末，只有對於一種病症的變化結果，係臨床上痛苦危險以及消耗體力種種症象，設法驅除，所謂對症療法」是。此種療法，係可以解除痛苦，防遏危險，維持體力，俾自然治愈之機能易於發揮：所以他在治療上之成績，和原因療法是異曲同工的。拿句尋常的話來說，這和舊醫方面的「治本」「治標」兩名詞，包含的意義是差不多的　我們曉得，關於肺結核症之特効藥，是經過人們的千呼萬喚，迄今還未見出來的　所以藥物的對症療法之爲醫者所採取，也是在所必然的。</p>
<p>關於肺結核症藥物的對症療法，是如何的情形呢？我們要想答覆這個問題，當然先須提到他的一般症象的，這在本書第七章所述，有盜汗·咳嗽·多痰·欬血·溫度增高·等種種：這都足以使病者陷於嚴重狀態，或致臨時危及生命的。所以醫者除開其他療法外，也應該審察當時的利害，用對症的藥物，俾引種症象解除或減輕，方不至有礙大局的。關於這方而的情形，讀者們有知道必要的，我現在且一一分述於下面：</p>
<p>溫度增高　肺結核患者，並不是每個都現溫度增高症象，但在進行期問則大都逃免不了的。就是在發生的時候，也大半用不着解熱專劑的：像鈣劑和鐵勃固靈之長期注射，溫度也可因之而下降，但兩者决不是解熱專劑，其他更可由此而推的。但如果患者溫度過高了，一般狀態現障礙了，像頭痛，食慾不佳，睡眠不安，等情：醫者自不能不採用對症療法，以求速効的。關於這一類的藥物，幾乎多不勝舉，就是醫者們之應用，也是各有各的主張和臨床上之經騐的。最着名的愛爾邦藥片，一般人幾視爲解本症高熱專劑似的，其實事實上並不盡然的；所以本症之高熱如何卽能减低，還是一大問題！但卽使用藥後果然减低了，患者們也無須過抱樂觀，因爲此種境界，是人爲的，藥物造成的，假使病灶本身的蔓延一天不靜止，停二日溫度仍復昇高的。再則，用退熱劑後，患者有因發汗過多，是極易發生虛脫狀態的。所以溫度增高之用退熱劑，是一種無可奈何的辦法，並不足爲訓的：臨床上應用，也應該儘量减少纔是！</p>
<p>咳嗽多痰　這兩種症象，大半是連帶發生的，也有但現劇咳而不見痰吐的。關於這一類對症藥物，雖然是狠多，但類別起來，總不外於袪痰劑鎭咳劑兩種。大概痰多者以用袪痰劑爲宜，乾咳無咳者則可問用鎭咳劑。如因過度劇咳，以致肺部過度動作患者眠不安枕，則鎭咳劑更省不了：但此種藥劑大都離不開麻醉作用，醫者應該謹愼從事的。對於年幼之小孩允其要不得！此外，鈣劑係有减少分泌之作用的，對於痰多的病者，也是不無助力的。</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （方正）</p>
<p>在黑漆一　裏走路，固然是困難的事，但是我們如能一步一步的仔細　去，總不難走出黑暗的盡頭，然而反觀我們生存這社會上又何獨不然！如果我們能夠踏正自己的步伐，不貪捷徑，不畏艱難，努力前進，總有達到目的的一天。</p>
<p>人們往往崇拜光明，厭惡黑暗，其實光明並不是完全好的，同時黑暗也不是完全劣的，我們試觀無腸公子，就是個很好的例子，因為它為了羡慕一時的光明，竟累了殺身之禍。</p>
<p>所以我們要崇拜黑暗，因為在黑暗中得到的光明，才是真正的光明，假如我們盲從地羡慕那虛偽的一時光明，不但得不到，而且還有身敗名裂的危險！</p>
<h3>科學與血肉的大戰</h3>
<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>世界上的預言家，都說一九三六年，是第二次大戰的一個年頭兒；尤其是英國文學家威爾士，他預言世界百年間之大變動，像煞一些也不會有錯誤，那其中關於十年內之遠東局勢，使人看了，真要不寒而慄吧！唉！現在確被他說着幾句，真不幸言而中了；不過是否就會惹起大戰的原因，還沒有顯著的　兆可證明，意阿的開火尙在前一年，那末：眼前這一座火藥庫，倘然爆裂起來，拿近來科學的進化上講，實在是可怕得很；吾來述個大略如下。</p>
<p>彈丸之子，他的力量，極其猛烈，足以洞穿一切敵方的障礙建築，他製造經過不過一日之間，可出四十八萬顆：</p>
<p>旋轉之砲，能於一分鐘內，放射砲彈一千餘發，而能摧毀前敵之防禦，使之不留一物；</p>
<p>機關之槍，僅重二公斤，每分鐘可發六百次，尙能夠繼續推進，藉作衝鋒；</p>
<p>猛裂之毒瓦斯，在三百二十公里之園經以內，得運用自如，使之播散充滿而無遣；</p>
<p>死光的發明，他製法且絕對秘密，不論堅固的橋樑，和穩定的砲壘，皆足以毀壞之；</p>
<p>其他在研究趕製的塲所，還沒有宣露的精良戰鬥物，正不曉得有多少；</p>
<p>你！想，照這樣的大家備戰，一旦交綏，在戰場上一一試騐，哼！人類的四肢百骸，依然故我，未曾稍進，要想和這種利器抗，那個勝，那個敗，其實勝敗，原是一個定名，並不是永久的定居，吾看當他盛的時候，萬軍用命，雖席捲一方而有餘，到了衰退的時候，一敗塗地，就算絕世的怪傑，也茍全性命而不得，然而被他指揮，受他蹂躪，損失的金錢，那還可以計算麼？一將功成，萬骨枯矣，爲什麽要拿有限的血肉，去狼藉到大地上去，博凱旋的日子，策勳飲至光榮；那個說人類是萬物的靈，我說真是太愚了；所以吾最後希望今年，戰神萬勿來臨，暄妍璀璨的，放出一　和平之花，照耀於世界。</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第二十四回　利重美人輕　夫割愛　志高雙足健壯土投荒</p>
<p>現在算是兄弟失言，買賣不必談了，玩笑也不必開了，我們專喝酒，談些別的事。我既是說錯了話，應該罰酒三杯。於是取過酒壺酒杯，就站在他面前，連連斟了三杯酒，自己舉起來喝了，笑道：該罰該罰。原諒原諒。北海對於他這話，本來也就說不到什麽怒意，再見人家喝了三杯酒，更沒有什麽可說的，因也笑道：我並非生賈先生的氣，只因這話讓別人聽去了，很容易生出一種誤會。賈多才看他那情形，已經是不會生什麽氣的了，臉上的笑容，又復加深了一層，回到自己位子上，随着敬酒敬菜起來。果然，在這一餐飯吃過，賈多才始終沒有提到過地皮和月英一句話。這麼一來，倒呌北海心裏，有些過意不去，只得和他道謝而別。他心裏，同時也就拴了一個疙瘩，非見着程志前不能解除。因之出了小西天的飲食部，一直就向後面院落裏走了去。只在程志芬房間的窗戶处站定，就看到張介夫穿了馬褂，在對襟紐扣上，正正當當的垂了一塊黃色徽章。自然，他滿臉都是笑容，遠遠的就聽到他道：　裏道些人我全混熟了。薪水可真是少，六十塊錢，還要打個八折。不過我的意思，並不在此。廳長也對我說了，不妨在廳裏先混上兩個月，外面有好缺，再放我出去。我想不就吧？一來介紹人的面子，有些摸不開，二來呢有了一個差使在手，到底一個月有點收入，貼補貼補旅館開銷，也是好的。廳長雖是北方人，他在那方多年，和我們南方人說話，是非常之投機的，仿佛也是同鄉一樣，所以他對我說話，十分客氣。志前在屋子裏背了兩手在身後，踱來踱去，把眉毛頭子緊緊的皺着。看那樣子，他心裏也就煩膩到所以然了。北海跳着到屋裏來，笑道：程先生，我有一件很有趣味的新聞報告給你。志前笑着點了點頭道：報上登的很詳細了，不就是賈多才的婚姻問題嗎？北海道：這件事真登報了嗎？（四〇七）</p>
<h3>記所見</h3>

<p>百靈鳥在乳白色的晨光中開了聲，一個鄉鎮的街頭，有一位約莫三四十歲模樣的婦女，頭縮着，嘴裏一股白氣，一口地一口繚繞着。手中拿着升斗，腋下夾着二尺直徑的小竹　簸箕，還有一條布袋。走向農民上鎮必經的街要三叉路口。就　袋放置在白霜滿佈的路面上。</p>
<p>伊立着，不時向四方張望：如果行人負荷了東西跑來，鎖着的眉毛，頓時展開了。米呀，麥呀，　子呀，都收買的。待落市的時候，再將收買的東西，　到大的行店去，藉以博取　頭之利。大約每一斗米，可以撈到十來個銅元。可是每天祗有僅僅幾斗米麥的生意呀！　伊是每年每月每晨站立在街頭；同行的更一起一起地　　競爭；生意　　衰落；單單空帶了風來回去，也是　常的事呀！（子明）</p>

<h3>盆梅培養法（上）</h3>
<p>— 胡楚玉</p>
<p>用土培養盆梅的方法，第一重在用土，普通用黑土三分，赤土四分，腐葉土二分，砂一分混合，可是也有用黑土與腐葉土，或赤土與腐葉土，又有單用肥沃的壤土與單用赤土的，若僅用黃砂肥培，那末，一時雖能成長，但永年的培養，决定沒有好結果的。因為梅根細長，單用黃砂時，往往當移植時候，想除去舊砂，其細根固結，很難解除，如勉強挖取，必要傷害細根，於是培養上發生種種困難了。所以反不如不用黃砂為宜。從前對於梅的用土，多在寒時晒過再用，就是使其容易分解，而且土中的微生物與害虫的卵，經了暴晒，也會死滅的。用土不拘何種，須經細眼的紗篩篩過，除去粉末，因為粉末太多的土，俗稱為盲土，盲土差不多沒有透隙，水亦不能透過，就是水分的含蓄量，與空氣的流通，都很不宜，肥料的分解，又極不宜，灌水若多，要成水溜，非常泥濘，容易使梅根腐敗，但用細眼紗篩土時，應當留心，第一，土要置在亁的地方，篩時兩手在三尺內外上面搖動，粉末落下時，為微風所吹去，細粒與粗粒土，自然能夠分開，就是粗粒的土，在鉢的下部，逐漸把細粒的土，撒在上面，那末是很適宜種植的。</p>
<p>移植</p>
<p>每年移植一次為最適宜，因為可以使植物攝取從土中不足的養分，如若再鉢內少量的土中，未經移植，那就妨碍新根的發育，所以經過移植，可把活動不敏的舊根除去，加了新土，能夠促進新根發生的。移植的時季，以秋季十月下旬至翌年三月間為宜，若到那四月，葉芽已萌，那就不可移植了。如為晚種，在三月下旬至四月上旬間，要保持開花，那末，在秋末冬初移植亦可。移植的方法，先把缽內的舊土緩緩除去三分之二，在無風陰靜的地方整理細根，手續須要快，倘把根多曝日光與通風，容易乾枯損傷。選用花缽，如專重賞花，可用淺缽，要養成枝葉發達，須用深缽，在鉢底敷以粗塊赤土或粗粒的砂石一二分，上面即用上面所說的乾土，土不可　得太實，以移植後的幹，不會動搖為度，再用噴霧器灌水，至水流出鉢底即止，然後放在無風的地方，過了數目，才可搬出外面，移植後切宜避雨，過了二十日，再施肥料，萬不可在用土內先混肥料，反害細根腐敗的。</p>
<p>肥料</p>
<p>梅性好肥料，但施肥的量與時季，與來年開花的多少，關係很大，假使要嫩樹的枝梢，成育旺盛，那末，祗用　素肥料，若要望開放美麗的花　，那就要加用燐酸肥料了。普通多用魚　或其他動物質的肥料，及人糞等為培養，如要清潔，那以用油　位主要品，油　的用法，以指頭大的數個，放於鉢土上面，若要完全肥培，應作油　的水肥，水肥的作法，把油　的粉末，或敲碎粗塊，裝在瓶中，注入清水，大約油　一升，灌水三升，經過二個月（自冬而春）如在夏季，約二十天，就會腐熟，且效力甚速，應多加二三倍水，才可施用，施肥的時季，從四月起至入梅以前，約施三次，其用量以使鉢土充分含潤為度，不過施肥時，先把盆土乾燥，着水分太多的土，吸收肥料，極不相宜，普通在午後或傍晚，代灌水之用。</p>
<p>梅的花芽，以入梅時至三月底可以决定，若再入梅前充分的施肥，那末，所出的新梢，非常有力的。又除上面所述油　肥料之外，用過燐酸石炭，每缽每次一茶匙，須用二三次，其所開的花，愈加鮮艷，（但灌水的手續，關係很大，）入梅之後，以不施肥，比較為安全，夏季亦不必施肥，或用極稀薄的油　水肥中，加些燐酸亦可，若要枝葉繁盛，那在夏季，應時加薄水肥要　發達，花　茂盛，那用過燐酸石炭，或骨粉等燐酸粉肥料，收效最快。秋末九月下旬至十月初，為施春肥最適時期，這時須用同一的濃肥一次，俗稱為花肥「就是用這次濃肥後，翌春的花，必能艷美開放的。寒季施用寒肥，本無效果，不如不施，夏季施用塊肥，有害無益。日本的植物園，當移植後的根能夠活動時，每日用薄水肥一次，以代水用，不過限於用砂時為宜，若以土為主用，那就不行的。還有用鳥糞肥料，以代油　的，因為鳥糞中多含燐分，非常相宜，可是用鳥糞時，切不可再加過燐酸與骨粉。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>山額夫人與節制生育</h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>以提倡節制生育聞名，現任國際節育研究會會長的美國人山額夫人，近爲宣傳其節育新法起見，又作第二次的環遊世界演講旅行，本月二十日已抵香港，近日亦將來滬，向本市各界，演講節育問題。此消息是極可喜。</p>
<p>生育節制，現在已是一個重要的社會問題。各國無限制的生育，造成人口過剩的現象。此結果，個人生活愈趨困迫，社會問題亦愈形複雜。且據人口學者馬爾賽斯說，人口增加，係依幾何級數而進，食物增加，則是數學級數。一國的人口，二十五年可增多一倍。故人口若不加以限制，必至發生食物的恐慌。今日世界各國的此爭彼奪，何嘗非由人口問題的引起。可見節育是極値得注意的問題。</p>
<p>然節制生育，現在雖爲一般人所贊成，惟反對的亦還不少。山額夫人前决環遊世界，宣傳節育，頗博各國的同情。但同時亦有人大加反對，多方阻止其宣傳。卽如此决來我國，已有耶穌會某牧師，對她的主張，大肆攻擊，指夫人的行爲，爲美國人兩性生活墮落的表現。其實此牧師的反對節育，若從宗敎的立塲反對，尙有理由，說她的行爲是美國人兩性生活墮落的表現，未免笑話。不過反對節育的，不只某牧師一人。近來德意兩國，不但不贊成節育，反而極力獎勵生育，惟它們施行此種政策，却是別有用意。卽欲望未來的戰塲上，能多添幾個槍靶哩。</p>
<p>最後，我們對於節育，尙有一事要提。卽過去提倡節制生育的結果，實行節育的只限於知識分子，一般人仍無限制的生育。此其影響所及，將來的人種，優秀的必漸被淘汰，愚劣的反而加多。此亦提倡節育者所不可不注意也。</p>
<h3>歸程</h3>
<p>— 天騏</p>
<p>冬天一來，雨量稀少了，宣江上游一帶的航程遂逐漸困難起來；三岔河一過，淺灘更多了。船身一擱到淺灘裏去，每每要費一兩個鐘頭時間，人落到河裏去用沙爬開出一條溝路來；若是還駛不通，船手們就要全體落到河裏去，用篙用肩用手，螞蟻運蒼蠅似地——河裏的人一面呼呌，船上的機手一面開足馬力往前推。遇到這樣情形，船手們雖然駡天怨地急暴得滿頭是汗，安坐在艙裏的搭客更覺得不勝焦急，閒言煩語自然難免了。旅途無伴原最悶不過，看到這樣情形，聽着船手們殺猪般的呼呌，心更覺得紛亂不甯了。</p>
<p>船行到芥溪口，已經五點多鐘了。看看太陽早已落到前面一座大山背後去了，而距松鎮還有五六里路程。船行到一截淺灘沙岸邊就停了下來，辦房出來當衆宣説，船已不能再往上駛，要搭客上岸跑路到鎮上去，行李由各人交給旅館派來接客的夥計另僱小艇運去。這時立卽報起一陣嘩噪。冬帮的搭客大多數都是南洋回家度歲的，不是行李瑣碎，就是牽男携女。天又暗了，要跑五六里路誰也不會願意走。但船已駛不上，還是沒辦法，而又聽說所有小火輪的搭客到芥溪口後都是自己跑路到鎭上去的。大家已失了主意，只得跑路去了。夜影迷朦的路上，百餘個旅客，小孩子呼爺喊媽的，亂糟糟摸索前去。幸好是嶺表天氣，雖然是冬天，也不會有如何冷凍的朔風吹來。人走過人家屋門時，惹得村犬狂吠起來，此吠彼應，一時人聲，狗呌，把個靜靜的山村頓然攪得一團騷亂。據一個走在我前頭的商人說：若果在兩年前，那般給淸鄉的兵爺嚇成驚弓之烏的村莊人家，這會子早又嚇得鷄飛狗走，以爲又有什麽亂兒出來了。他這句話忽然引起一個「番客」的聯想，他隨身大的帶有一點金器銀錢，聽了這話，連忙問：</p>
<p>——那，那，路上就不怕歪人來打搶我們？</p>
<p>這般「番客」們說來都够可憐的。他們爲了生活，爲了養育父母子女，不惜離鄉背井，飄洋過海，走到千萬里外的番邦去，經十年八載的含辛茹苦，流盡汗血，幸而積下一付扎脚，纔得回來，滿意回到家鄉後可以過一時太平安定的日子，那會料到家鄉的一切早都變了個樣了？</p>
<p>幸好，大隊行客終沒有應到那個「番客」所想的遭遇。大的八點鐘光景，轉過一座崗口，就望見了鎭上的燈火了，大家心裏頓時輕鬆起來，脚步也放快了。鎭市原在河的北面，渡船已由先頭的人喚好。隔河遙望，河北沿岸，燈火閃灼，倒影水中；更遠處，漁燈灼灼，隱的河面，看來益覺幽美，胸襟爲之一淸了。只可惜疲憊之身，更以顚沛生涯，磨折殆遍，閑情逸致早已付之流水，不然，這山溪夜渡的好景大足供我發發古人之幽情了。</p>
<p>到鎭時街上冷淸淸的，店舖都關好門了。轉了一個拐彎之後，前面忽然燈火華亮起來，定睛看時，一連四五問店子的大門都大開着，當中懸着一塊布幔，上面用顏色墨汁寫着××公司名字，裏面屏風兩面過門上邊，一邊貼的一是「龍吟」一邊貼的「虎嘯」的紅紙帖兒，店中間密密的擠了一團人，銀毫花啦花啦的響着。原來這山村小鎭裏的番攤館也如此繁榮！</p>
<p>人疲憊極了。卸衣洗操時攙發現皮鞋經石子擦了兩塊疤痕，心裏痛惜得什麽似的；入睡以後，又經査夜的兵爺呌起兩决百般盤詰，眞不懂一個過往旅客犯了什麽大罪？叵到內地來，原來睡覺的自由也要被剝奪呀！</p>
<h3>瞎話</h3>
<p>— （傻）</p>
<p>據司法行政部，統計二十二年度離婚案件，共達四百四十八件之多，其實離婚而未經法庭公判者，恐有數倍於此，譚老三曰，靑年的苦悶，有畢業卽失業之口號，以後男女的結合，必定成爲結婚卽離婚的口號。</p>
<p>港醫界名流，二十日敦請山額夫人演講節制生育問題，聽者甚衆，平市婦女界，亦擬請山額夫人去演講，譚老三曰，現在父母對於子女，非但養育問題，難以解决，而敎育問題，更是困難，此山額夫人之所以出風頭歟？或曰，否，恐多種亡國奴之餘孽也。</p>

<h3>拉縴</h3>
<p>— 勞心</p>
<p>—海航的故事—</p>
<p>這下水船，帶了不少梧州貨，什麼桂枝，桑寄生的重重地壓滿了一貨船。我們也埋怨不來的，爲的是從鹽塲開出來時東家吩咐過的：這世界吃飯不容易，這趟下水船多少得帶點土貨，到稚瑤犬瀝圩這些地方，卸一卸，幸運大家可以得分到多少花紅。我們心里雖不願意，單是老桂一個便氣爆了火！</p>
<p>「過年時候，一水船要人家一頭半月，眞的要命嗎？難道別人家沒有家小，不要回轉去一次兩决。……」</p>
<p>但是，這些牢騷是拗不過東家的，象三老爹說：</p>
<p>「你吃的那人家的飯？」</p>
<p>這樣便象賣猪仔一七式賣斷了身，除非東家不要我們的命，他要時還是一樣的沒辦法。</p>
<p>於是，從河口卸了駁輸，我們又得一篙一篙地撑着這大笨象般的貨船走埠頭了。一走埠頭便得十日八日，誰不氣煞。</p>
<p>「你祖宗十八代的，要你老子的命咧！」</p>
<p>老七埋怨着，三老爹這時也變得和氣了，大槪在梧州九坊街他的契係那里鬆下了不少「寳」不是牌九輸了，一定是天九給人扭了結，便是這樣地沒神沒氣的，甚麽事也不起勁。</p>
<p>船撑過了寳口了。向左拐轉入大涌口，預備趕到種淫去歇午卸貨，提起了、靠碼頭，大家都有了興緻了，五叔第一個站起來，把篙撑得又深又遠，口里－</p>
<p>喲哎喲呀，嚟！－啊，</p>
<p>鬼呌你窮呀－喲啊，啊……</p>
<p>頂九硬上呀！」</p>
<p>一篙一篙地帶若船走。大涌口便象褲浪一樣窄，又淺，泥底的足有尺來深，篙撑了下去，援不起來，用力一拔，貨船便象給誰搔了一下癢般顫了一下。大家心又急，又撑不動。</p>
<p>「嫻契弟，詛什麽祖宗咧，撑不動便去拉吧，文想食肥肉，又不會去渝，我　　的　。</p>
<p>三老爹的脾氣也象醃酸了的梅子一樣發霉了。</p>
<p>「拉呀，契弟！」</p>
<p>老桂第一個去抽了拉縴，兩手用力扯了一扯，試試看這用了他祖宗三代也沒有換過的拉縴牢不牢，然後再在船頭那個洞里豎了一根棒，跟着我和老七也去拿了一根拉緯，一頭紮了在棒上，一頭打了一個生結，縛在臂膀上。船稍微徧靠了左面，一跳我們便上了堤，給泥滑了一個空。趕快再走緊幾步，過了船頭，老桂走先，我夾在當中，老七怕跌一個平天大友的跟在我的後面。</p>
<p>給西江水浸過的堤路還沒有弄好，一高一低地象一個二個小泥崗。而且還下了兩天雨，路全變成了漿糊一樣濘滑。我們走了上去，全靠了十個趾頭的力，挿進泥里去下工夫，才算可以滑過。我們相信，若果敎外地人跑到這里來拉縴，怕不象孫行者一樣愛翻跟斗嗎。</p>
<p>「象去年淸明，跟阿福走這條水，阿福便一共躀了八交，都是蛤　番天一樣四爪扒扒……」</p>
<p>拍——達！</p>
<p>老桂的話還沒有說完，老七在後面便扮了一個四爪朝天。引得愛和他鬥氣的五叔在貨船上笑得儘在前仰後合。三老爺也忍不得打了幾個哈哈。我們也笑了，但更提防我們也來一個。</p>
<p>沒有太陽的陰暗日子，田野里誧滿了都是蒼灰色，一二里路內是看不見第三個行路人的。只有遠遠的那邊山脚下一隊長長的挑着了東西的人影，我們懂得那是趁龍頭圩回來的傢伙，他們有些是趨着十多里路去趁一圩的。</p>
<p>「他們和我們都是一樣苦的哩！」</p>
<p>我呢喃着，老桂却在前面掉了一番道理回來：</p>
<p>「誰又不是一樣？爲了食吧咧，契弟，他們有錢的便把我們當成了牛馬，任你一年拉到黑，還得看他的臉色拿工錢。他們不又是一對眼睛一個鼻樑嗎？爲什麽我們要辛苦地拉，他却在享白福？入你祖宗娘個爛臭貨，有一天，看你老子……」</p>
<p>「拍－達－」響了一聲更大的，老七又跌番了交。這趟兒我門再沒有　　笑了。</p>
<p>小說</p>
<h3>靑陽港的初冬（一）</h3>
<p>— 秋原</p>
<p>一個明朗的初冬下午，天是高高的，得着一朶朶的，瞬息萬變的白雲，柔軟無力的陽光照射在一間尙稱整潔的公寓房間裏，房間裏懸掛着的一張以F地爲背景的本彩畫上，一張明眸潔齒，活躍多姿的少女的像上，一張舖着黃色毛毯的單人床上。周圍是靜靜的。于卓民在從安樂居喫完了中飯，沒精打采地回到他的房間裏，洗了手，洗了臉，拿起一枝捲烟燃着，看看噴出來的一絲一絲的裊繞的靑烟，那張爲陽光照射而更顯得明郞的照相，以及那張輕快的水彩畫，又看看窗外的晴空，聯結着的人家，不禁自言自語的發出了沒有人聽見的獨白。</p>
<p>——這樣好的天氣，不去看她又幹麽？</p>
<p>於是他整了一整他的領結，被上了那穿了已有八年的那件從美國帶回來的大衣，將帽子歪戴着，以輕快的脚步走出了戶門，將戶門隨手帶上鎖，一路瀟瀟洒洒，彷彿飄飄欲仙似的走到升降梯前，走到電車站前。</p>
<p>——唔，今天我總應該將她找住，來好好的消磨這一個明朗的初冬佳日。</p>
<p>在一羣人叢中，他擠上了已經有滿坑滿谷的人了的無軌電車，站着濟着，連那枝吸了一半的那枝捲烟，也將它輕輕的拋到車窗外的馬路上。他也不曉得在看什麼，在想什麼。車上的人是這麼多，又是這麼雜，要不是爲了秋華，于卓民自決不會趁這他最討厭的無軌電車的。他又似乎並不留意着這些川流不息的止止落落的乘客，僅僅用了左手，挾着上面的籐圈，呆站着，呆想着。</p>
<p>——今天她一定在，她一定在……</p>
<p>在他的目的地下了車，走近了那所是學校又不是學校的學校，問了那位蓄着一些鬍鬚的胖胖而又極老　的司閽者。不待他話說完，這位否則倒很像是達官巨富的司閽者早就回報他說：</p>
<p>——王秋華不在。</p>
<p>沒有說一句話，他舉起手做了一下吿別的手勢，撥起步退了出去，不免又是垂着頭。從衣袋裏摸出了一枝捲烟，將它燃着，用力將熄了的火柴朝地上一擲，脚步當然慢了起來；也沒有這種情緒看噴出來的一口一口的靑烟了。</p>
<p>——她上那兒去了呢？不會，……也許在家，……也許到我那兒來了……，不錯，……</p>
<p>於是于卓民的脚步又輕快了起來，提高了速度走向電車站前，也不管人多，擠着上去，恨不得立刻就回到他的那間房間。</p>
<p>——于先生，有個女客在你房裏。</p>
<p>當振民用快速的脚步，走向他的房間的時候，侍役就報吿他這樣一個消息。</p>
<p>——是誰，是誰，更全有誰，要不是她！</p>
<p>開了房門，固然發見王秋華在伏着案寫字。</p>

<p>阿巧：那麼，向大哥，你說我們上那兒去的好呀？</p>

<h3>閑話「父母子女」</h3>
<p>— 孤歌</p>
<p>文化公司「父母子女」已於星期六在金城戲院公映，在影片公映後，並　　片主角　　　女士及小明　胡蓉蓉小姐登臺表演歌唱，舞蹈，　秋霞女士為我國歌舞界之翹楚，其天才早為國全人全國所讚美此次破例登台表演一九三六年最新舞蹈「春夢舞」舞姿之美，歌舞之嬌服裝之艷，可說登峯造標，載歌載舞，誠為空前所罕見，新進童星胡蓉蓉演出一鳴驚人，登台所表演之「洋囡囡舞」天真活潑，令人可愛不啻秀蘭鄧波兒，全場掌聲如雷，觀眾無不讚美感嘆謂「觀止之舞蹈」。</p>
<p>「父母子女」中之歌曲，以國立音專男女生合唱之「出征歌」最為　壯，餘如　秋霞女士唱出之主題歌「父母子女」歌喉技巧深為婉轉，若無基本修養，不克臻此佳境，　　英女士所唱之國劇改編「漁民淚」，音調頗為美麗，為有聲片歌曲中之僅見曲調，聆之大有神往之概。</p>
<p>「父母子女」全片之結構穿插，成為新方式之構成，此片觀後，情感為之移動轉變，有如看十部不同味之影片，誠本年度最新穎而頗感興趣之影片也。</p>
<h3>藝華陣容檢閱（續）</h3>
<p>— 松子</p>
<p>一朶花</p>
<p>徐蘇　的處女座「一花　」是一部有着極盡　綿曲折故事的悲劇。內容以一歌舞團為背景，述一孤苦歌女一聲淒涼之遭遇，在疾苦的環境之下追求生活，並寫出社會的冷酷，人情的刻薄。劇情極盡哀感頑艷，現實生動。徐蘇靈在文壇上向以細膩的作風見稱，他對於電影藝術更有深切的理解，這部「一　花」是經過他幾次三番考慮而成的，對於這個　有請感而現實的故事，據說將以極精密而細膩的格調來演出，使觀眾觀後得到一個深刻的印象。</p>
<p>小老虎</p>
<p>岳楓繼「花燭之夜」後的新作「大老虎」，是一部極嚴重極現實的社會問題劇。劇中述一有為之青年因生活之脅迫，不得已淪落為匪，但終卒被逮。劇作者是在為生活壓迫挺而走險的苦兒孤女呼　，同時喚起一般有識人士為了民族的生存計，社會的安寧計，應當怎樣去推進民衆敎育，安置這般失掉了底蔭的世界未來的主人翁。</p>
<p>除了這個嚴重的宗旨，劇中更描寫父母愛子之心的如何痛切，如何苦心孤詣地希望子女的成功，但結果却反有因溺愛過甚而反害了子女。岳楓在「逃亡」「花燭之夜」中運用了他獨到的導演技巧而獲得了功成，這部片子將仍秉着過去的作風，以幽默的格調來處理，他信地一定更有偉大的成就。</p>
<h3>銀色雜筆</h3>
<p>黃天始先生南京之行，據說也是「很不錯的樣子」。預料不久之後，必將大有一番鴻圖可展，現在則正在由房子中云。</p>
<p>南京中國舞台協會到上海來演戲之說，起先是一陣熱，繼之則一陣冷，現在則又我冷而熱了。據最近的消息，唐槐秋，洪深，應雲衛，馬祥彥等四位，現正分頭在向上海各戲院接中。</p>
<p>從徐來以二千元為　徐公欣夫的中國第二部有聲偵探片「金剛鑽」為條件的消息經鐵根刊載之後徐欣夫和張石川都很不高興，張石川並且還大發雷霆。</p>
<p>距向　良先生宣布「計劃」之後，現在已半個多月了。向先生說在一個月左右讓我們看「黑暗中的紅光」等戲的，現在不知下文如何？</p>
<p>「戲劇前輩」自然有「戲劇前輩」的「　法」，不過，一個的日期是恨快的呀「　票」的日期我記得清清楚楚的。</p>
<h3>天一銀訊一束</h3>
<p>— 白芸</p>
<p>天一有聲新片「兩兄弟」將繼「父母子女」，之後獻映於本埠金城大戲院。</p>
<p>陸麗霞為中國演技最佳之女演員，而「兩兄弟」又係陸小姐僅有之遺作故是片之公映，必然萬眾期相。</p>
<p>王次龍「兩兄弟」之成功，是陸麗霞之成功。</p>
<p>天一聲片「花花草草」，現已攝成六分之二強。</p>
<p>「花花草草」擬拍法庭一塲，為逼真起見日昨助導演冷波，開麥拉·曼沈勇石·置景師鄭未明，劇務沈亞倫等分頭赴特一，特二各區法院實地參觀，用為借鋸。</p>
<p>「花花草草」攝製甚慢的原因，是為了排戲太費時間了。</p>

<h3>Important Figures in Guangdong Province Exchanged Diplomatic Opinions Yesterday, Meeting at Hu Hanmin's Residence, with Wang Zhengting Also Participating in the Discussion</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: Wang Zhengting, accompanied by Xie Yibang, visited Hu Hanmin at Yanyuan at 10:00 AM on the 24th. After a lunch meeting, Xiao Focheng, Zou Lu, Chen Jitang, and Li Zongren went together to meet and exchange diplomatic opinions in detail. At 2:00 PM, Wang went to the Youth Association to give a speech, and in the evening, he attended a banquet hosted by Chen Jitang. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: Wang Zhengting said on the 24th that this visit was in a private capacity to see Hu, Xiao, Chen, Li, etc., and he is scheduled to return north on the 25th. Regarding the Sino-Japanese issue, I advocate a comprehensive solution, while Japan advocates negotiating on a case-by-case basis. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>Fuzhou: Wang Zhengting is scheduled to arrive in the province via Shantou and Xiamen on the 27th. The Rotary Club branch has rushed to prepare a welcome. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>Guangzhou: Wang Zhengting arrived here on Saturday and Sunday. Today he met with Hu Hanmin and other southwestern leaders to discuss the political situation. Wang will attend a Rotary Club banquet tonight and is scheduled to leave the province tomorrow morning. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<h3>Matsui Flies to Yong to Visit Bai Chongxi</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: Matsui flew to Yong on the morning of the 24th to meet Bai Chongxi and will return to Guangdong on the 25th or 26th, and then come to Hong Kong on the 27th to transfer to Fujian. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: Song Bing met with Xiao Focheng on the 23rd to seek opinions on Asianism. Xiao replied that the Asianism advocated by Japan is contrary to what the Premier advocated. Therefore, the more Japan talks about Asianism, the less peaceful East Asia becomes. To solve the Sino-Japanese issue, Japan must change its policy. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: Hosoya, accompanied by Japanese Consul Kawai, paid a courtesy visit to Liu Jiwen at 10:00 AM on the 24th. At noon, Liu returned the visit to the consulate. At 5:00 PM, a tea party was held at the city government to receive them. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<h3>Ross Arrives in Hong Kong from Guangdong, Guangdong Merchants Oppose the Connection of the Two Railways</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: After bidding farewell to various agencies at noon on the 24th, Ross returned to Hong Kong by car at 4:30 PM. Before leaving, he said that the results of this trip were satisfactory. According to sources, regarding the connection of the Guangdong-Hankou and Guangzhou-Kowloon railways, Ross consulted with the central government in Nanjing, and the central government only agreed to consider it, and there was no close agreement on the terms of consultation. After the connection, it would be beneficial externally in times of emergency, but this benefit would not outweigh the harm, as Guangzhou's commerce would be irreparable. When Ross presented this proposal to the Guangdong authorities, the authorities expressed clearly that after the connection, foreign goods could directly reach the interior of our country, which would be extremely harmful to trade. Guangdong is currently planning to build a branch line to Huangpu and open Huangpu Port. Zhang Gongquan's visit to Guangdong is closely related to the planning after the completion of the Guangdong railway. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: According to political news, although Guangdong does not want the connection of the Guangzhou-Kowloon and Guangdong-Hankou railways, it is possible. A decision can be made after Zhang Gongquan arrives in Guangdong. Guangdong merchants are preparing to hold a large petition to oppose the connection. Ross arrived in Hong Kong at 7:30 PM and stayed at the Governor's Mansion. He will stay for two or three days and return to Shanghai on the Russian Empress, refusing to talk about his visit to the province. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>Guangzhou: Sir Arthur Salter, economic advisor to the British government, has been discussing economic and monetary issues with southwestern leaders for the past four days. Today, he returned to Hong Kong by train. Before leaving, he told a Reuters reporter that this trip was quite quick, but its mission was only for investigation and had nothing to do with politics. When asked about Chinese merchant trade, Ross replied that although exports have recently increased, the general situation has not yet prospered to its proper level, as there are various events that hinder trade. The authorities should find ways to eliminate these obstacles. He had discussed the connection of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway and the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway with Guangzhou leaders. In his view, both railways can benefit from the connection, and Guangzhou can become more prosperous because Guangzhou's prosperity depends on the prosperity and development of the interior. The most urgent need at present is for cheap and fast transportation of goods. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>Guangzhou: Local Chinese newspapers reported the remarks of a government spokesperson, saying that the Guangzhou authorities are not prepared to consider the proposal to connect the Guangdong-Hankou and Guangzhou-Kowloon railways, as this move will facilitate the inflow of foreign goods into the interior and will be a great harm to the economy of southern China. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<h3>British Visiting Aircraft Flies to Shanghai, Forced to Land Midway</h3>
<p>Xiamen: Two British visiting aircraft flew to Shanghai on the morning of the 24th. One aircraft, number 3594, remained due to obstacles and is now docked behind Gulangyu. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>Xiamen: The British airship that flew out of Xiamen was forced to land at Nanguan Harbor, 55 miles south of Wenzhou, on the border of Fujian and Zhejiang, at 1:35 PM due to bad weather. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>Xiamen: Two British airships took off for Shanghai at 10:10 AM this morning. Another one, due to engine damage, is waiting for parts to be shipped from Singapore for repairs and will only be able to continue from here after ten days. It is reported that the airship was one of the two that arrived here yesterday from Hong Kong. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<h3>New Japanese Ambassador Arita Leaves Japan for China, Accompanied by Military Attaché Isoya</h3>

At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, they paid a farewell visit to Foreign Minister Zhang, talking for 20 minutes before leaving. Oes-Hao is returning to his country on leave as usual to bid farewell to our authorities and will return to China to resume his duties after six months. Zhang will host a farewell banquet on the evening of the 25th, and then return to Shanghai that night to take a ship back to his country next month on the 3rd.

(Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<h3>Yan Huiqing Cables the Ministry, Requesting Leave to Return Home for Recuperation, Rumors of Resignation are Not True</h3>
<p>Nanjing: Ambassador to the Soviet Union Yan Huiqing, due to his illness not being cured and doctors advising him to recuperate, and the cold weather in the north making it difficult to recuperate, recently cabled the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requesting leave to return home to recuperate. The Ministry replied approving his request. It is heard that Yan is scheduled to leave Moscow in mid-March and return to China, first coming to Beijing to report everything to Foreign Minister Zhang and will stay in the south for a longer period of time to rest. Regarding rumors that Yan intends to retire due to old age and frailty, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that this is not true. During Yan's leave, the affairs of the embassy will be handled by Counselor Wu Nanru. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<h3>Wang Shijie Issues a Statement, Ordering All Schools to Strictly Enforce School Discipline, and Take Resolute Measures When Necessary, the National Crisis Education Plan is Under Consideration</h3>
<p>Nanjing: Recently, several schools in Beiping, Tianjin, and Wuhan have had students opposing make-up exams, threatening teachers, or insulting representatives coming to Beijing to listen to instructions. The turmoil in the schools has not yet subsided. A reporter from the Central News Agency believes that these matters are of great importance to school discipline and the future of education, so on the 24th, he visited Minister Wang of the Ministry of Education.

In addition to ordering all schools to strictly enforce school discipline and punish those who instigate the turmoil without leniency, it has also decided to take resolute measures when necessary, suspend funding, and temporarily dissolve the schools in order to correct them. As for the national crisis education plan, the Ministry is carefully considering it and should promulgate and implement it after it is finalized, with the principle of achieving practical results without hindering the legitimate basic training of schools at all levels.

<p>Nanjing: Chairman Lin reported at the National Government Memorial Week on the morning of the 24th, first saying that the Premier invented the theory of "knowing is difficult, acting is easy," breaking the unbreakable fallacy of "knowing is not difficult, acting is difficult" in our country for thousands of years. This is indeed the most valuable and greatest invention since ancient times. Its effect on promoting scientific progress and the implementation of revolution is extremely great. From the Premier's theory, we can know that the lack of progress in many things in China in the past is actually because the Chinese people do not "seek knowledge," so they lack ideals and everything cannot be improved. The many failures in many things in the past are actually because the Chinese people do not "strive to act." We should all take this invention of the Premier as a creed to encourage, urge, and follow in our daily lives and work. We should know "how difficult it is," we should strive to seek knowledge, "acting is easy," we should strive to act. Now, to revive the nation and save the country from disaster, everyone needs to work hard in seeking knowledge and striving to act in order to achieve it. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>Nanjing: Yu Youren reported at the Central Party Headquarters Memorial Week on the morning of the 24th, entitled "The Cultivation of Ancient Sages and National Reconstruction." His original words are as follows: Chairman and comrades, since the general assembly, Chairman Lin's elaboration of party principles in the National Government, Vice Chairman Jiang, Committee Member Feng, Dean Dai, and the comrades' speeches on self-reliance and saving the country, being a revolutionary, and the new life movement in the Central Government are all the most important instructions of this era. My report today is originally based on the comrades' intention and is only a solemn explanation. The formation of a nation naturally originates from the relationship of blood, life, customs, language, writing, and beliefs. However, its ability to stand on its own and survive must have its own firm, unshakable, and indelible spiritual and material conditions. From the early pioneering period to the period of gradual improvement, this spirit and material conditions must have been prepared, and then this nation has the possibility of its own existence. From this, we can know that the prosperity of a nation and ours are measured by whether these conditions are fully possessed and whether we are progressing. However, the constituent elements of a nation cannot all understand the responsibility of this nation to stand on its own and survive. Therefore, the sages in a nation, in a position of foresight, create and build for this nation and adopt the strengths of other nations for the benefit of their own nation, such as the guidance of lifestyles, the invention and improvement of various things needed for life, clothing, food, shelter, and transportation, the political need for an organization to govern the affairs of the public, then there is the establishment of the country, and the moral need for a category to regulate the behavior of the masses, then there is the determination of names, duties, and ethics. The so-called "Heaven gives birth to the people, and makes them rulers and teachers" is to explain the great mission undertaken by the ancient sages for a nation. China has been established for thousands of years, and our nation has a long history of thousands of years. The various spiritual and material creations and inventions are all the contributions and legacies of the ancient sages to our country and nation. Its greatness and longevity are unmatched by any country and nation in the world, and the self-cultivation and efforts of the ancient sages who can undertake this responsibility and complete this mission should be emulated by all generations. Therefore, today I specially raise the topic of "The Cultivation of Ancient Sages and National Reconstruction" and respectfully make a report. Let's start with the merits of the Yellow Emperor. Confucian writings stop at Tang and Yu, which is due to the political system rather than the historical system. Therefore, this great ancestor is not often mentioned in Confucianism. Taoism does praise the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, but what is passed down to later generations is not elegant and mostly contains vague and absurd sayings. Therefore, the merits of the Yellow Emperor in participating in heaven and earth and nurturing all things are mostly buried. When we examine the records, we know that the Yellow Emperor's literary and military achievements really shook the world. First, the Yellow Emperor's creations, in terms of material objects, such as clothing, palace rooms, boats, chariots, compasses, bows and arrows, musical instruments, etc., and in terms of culture, such as writing, arithmetic, the stems and branches calendar, weights and measures, and medicine, etc. Second, the Yellow Emperor's education emphasizes morality and training in health. Third, the Yellow Emperor's strategy used fifty-two battles to quell Chi You, so that our nation was spared the invasion of foreign tribes and was able to live and thrive in peace, expanding the territory and making the scope of our nation's creation of civilization greater, inspecting the four directions and making the journey of our nation's cultural dissemination wider, and enfeoffing descendants and multiplying grandchildren, not only the Han people as their descendants, such as the Qiang of the Tibetan people, the Anxi of the Hui people, the Yuhao of the Miao and Li peoples, the Xiongnu of the Mongolian people, the Xianbei of the Donghu people, and the ancestors of the Jin people as descendants of the Yellow Emperor, all of whom are descendants of the Yellow Emperor, becoming the great Chinese nation, and this is what historians in modern times can examine and believe. Therefore, the Yellow Emperor is really a great creator and inventor, and also the spiritual commander of our great Chinese nation. Emperor Yao's Zhi governance: The records of how Emperor Yao brought the world to the extreme and prosperous governance can be found in Yao Dian, such as "Clearly understanding outstanding virtue to be close to the nine clans, after the nine clans were harmonious, discussing and clarifying the people, the people were clear and bright, harmonizing all nations," This is to transform the world with supreme virtue and make the world reach Zhi governance. The so-called "in illuminating bright virtue, in renovating the people, in stopping at the highest good" in the Great Learning, its meaning is based on this, and Yao's cultivation in transforming the people and forming customs can be seen in several words of the Book of Documents. Therefore, at that time, he wanted to give up the world, but Xu You did not accept it, and Chao Fu heard of it and washed his ears, and the old man who beat the earth only knew to rest and farm, not knowing what the emperor's power had, This was a grand occasion of peace and prosperity in the world at that time, which was truly unprecedented in history, and Yao still sought talent and virtue widely, promoted them in time, and clearly promoted the hidden and lowly, and obtained Da Shun to open the situation of yielding. Emperor Shun bears the weight of the world: Emperor Shun's wisdom and civilization are why he can bear the weight of the world, and his father was stubborn, his mother was rude, and Xiang was arrogant, but he could harmonize with filial piety, and when he was farming, fishing, pottery, and planting, he could cause farmers to yield the ridges and pedestrians to yield the road, and the utensils were not poor, and within a year or two, the place where he lived became a town and a gathering place, and his own cultivation and what he inspired already had signs of illuminating bright virtue and renovating the people, so Yao repeatedly tested him in things and observed his virtue in dealing with ordinary and changing situations, and yielded the throne to him, and later appointed Yu, Ji, Qi, Gao Yao, and Boyi and other ministers to bring peace and benefit to the world, and punished and removed those who did not perform their duties, such as Gong Gong, Huan Dou, and Gun, to rectify discipline, so he could carry forward Yao's Zhi governance. Da Yu set the model for political responsibility in China: Yu, as the son of a criminal, did not dare to pursue private grudges and forget the public of the world, and his virtue was enough to be promoted to Shun, although he killed his father, he did not abandon his son, and made him inherit the world, This is truly the spirit of the world for the public. Now, I will describe Yu's merits in detail. First, Yu thought that the drowning in the world was like his own drowning. Second, Yu's flood control could follow the nature of the water and guide it, and should not fill and block the sea, and at the same time, he controlled the water, cutting trees on the mountains, developing water conservancy, and managing the people's livelihood, and moved the people of the world without resentment. Third, Yu's flood control was laborious and preoccupied for eight years outside, and he passed his home three times without entering. Fourth, he ate frugally and showed filial piety to the ghosts and gods, wore bad clothes and devoted himself to the beauty of the ceremonial robes, and lived in humble palaces and devoted himself to the ditches. Fifth, he pitied the prisoners and listened to good words. Sixth, he established a specialized and complete political organization in China, and its main principles are, such as "Virtue is good governance, and governance lies in nourishing the people. Water, fire, metal, wood, soil, and grain, only correct virtue. Using livelihood, only harmonize the land and make heaven and earth six governments and three affairs to govern." Seventh, Shun's praise of Yu said, "He is diligent in the ministry, thrifty in the home, and always humble." Yu inherited Shun's training nine, saying, "The human heart is dangerous, the Taoist heart is subtle, only be precise and single-minded, and sincerely hold the middle." Tang's merits and self-cultivation, "Tang and Wu's revolution followed heaven and responded to the people," Tang革Xia ordered, released Jie Nanchao, and opened a new situation for Chinese politics, and his self-cultivation can be seen in the book, "Do not be close to sensual pleasures, do not cultivate goods and profits, virtue and frugality promote officials, meritorious achievements promote guests, use people as yourself, and do not be stingy to correct mistakes, be wide and benevolent, and trust the people." It can be seen in the Pan Ming, "If you can renew yourself for one day, you can renew yourself every day, and you can renew yourself again." It can be seen in the Zhong Hui's Proclamation, "Serving with righteousness, controlling the heart with ritual, one who can gain a teacher for oneself will be king, and one who thinks that no one is like himself will perish, one who loves to ask will be rich, one who is self-serving will be small, be careful in your cultivation, and only be at the beginning." The virtues of King Wen, King Wu, and the Duke of Zhou: The Zhou family started with Hou Ji teaching the people to grow grain and opening up the foundation with loyalty and generosity, so they enjoyed the country for the longest time. At first, King Tai had three sons, Taibo, Yu Zhong, and Jili. Jili's son Chang (that is, King Wen) was born with sacred virtue. King Tai wanted to pass the country to Jili and Chang, and Taibo and Yu Zhong knew this, so they decided to avoid and yield to fulfill their father's wishes, that is, they fled to the southeast, using their culture to enlighten Wu. It is even traced back to ancient times when the traffic from the northwest to the southeast was extremely dangerous and difficult. Even though Shun and Yu had experienced hardships and had long been tempered, Shun died in Cangwu on his southern tour, and Yu died in Kuaiji on his eastern tour. However, Taibo and Yu Zhong fled thousands of miles to Changshu and other places today, gradually using the northern culture to enlighten and create in the southeast. Therefore, today's brilliant development of the culture in the southeast first inherited the culture of the Central Plains, and the beginning was precisely with Taibo and Yu Zhong's yielding. Taibo and Yu Zhong then made this great and long-lasting achievement in the southeast. In the Zhou family, it was from Jili to King Wen to King Wu, and the Zhou family unified the world and held the throne for eight hundred years. Our country's political artifacts, creations, and academic studies were fully prepared at this time. Confucius called Taibo the highest virtue, and the matter of his yielding virtue is truly great and far-reaching. King Wu's revolution, with one battle and the world surrendered, carried the Eastern Expedition with the tablet, and made an oath in Muye, winning the remaining and killing, and returned to the flourishing state of returning horses and releasing cattle, removing all the harsh policies of the Shang Dynasty and starting anew with the people, recording the Jizi and receiving the Nine Categories, reversing the previous dynasty's deficiencies, and laying the foundation for the people's livelihood. The Duke of Zhou created the great rules of opening the country and set the beautiful system for all ages, making rituals and music, and laying the foundation for the Zhou family's political power without exhaustion. His political thought is in the Zhou Official, seeing the spirit of organization, and his social construction thought is in the Zhou Ritual, using ritual education to establish the foundation of society, and the self-cultivation of the people in it, such as being hardworking, humble, and approachable, talented, and multi-skilled, cannot be fully described. Confucius's supreme sage, "Confucius inherited Yao and Shun and modeled Wen and Wu," His inheriting is to be the beginning of a great unity, and his modeling is to be the origin of a well-off society. The world calls Confucius the great sage of accomplishment, and the so-called "to establish a heart for heaven and earth, to establish a life for the people, to continue the unique learning for the past sages, and to open peace for all ages" can describe the greatness of Confucius, and his personal cultivation is seen in the Analects and the Book of Rites, which are abundant. Confucius's learning, from the investigation of things to the extension of knowledge, the sincerity of intentions, the rectification of the heart, the cultivation of the body, the regulation of the family, to the governance of the country and the pacification of the world, has a consistent system, a clear distinction between the root and the tip, and his self-cultivation is the foundation for transforming the era, society, country, and nation. The cultivation of ancient sages from illuminating bright virtue to renovating the people to stopping at the highest good, from oneself to pushing to regulating the family, governing the country, and pacifying the world, from the old era and old society to improving the new era and new society, from the old personal life to improving the new personal life, from the old country and nation to promoting to the new country and nation, so I cite the cultivation of past sages to be an example for today's world, and speaking of national reconstruction, what relates to blood and geography is shallow, and what relates to the spiritual aspect is deep. The nation should seek renewal every day so that it can stand on its own and survive, that is, if our great Chinese nation does not have new cultivation, it will definitely not be able to overcome this great difficulty at present. The great path of cultivating the body, regulating the family, governing the country, and pacifying the world lies in our daily life, and the pacification of the world lies in the world for the public, and the public is also peace. How can the world be public and peaceful? The sages of the past have shown us from the theoretical and practical aspects, and now it only depends on how our people and our nation emulate the ancients to learn from the present and the past. Therefore, the fearless spirit of the nation can only overcome oneself first, and then overcome the enemy. I hope to encourage each other with this. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>On General Matsui's "Asian League" Theory</h3>
<p>— Star</p>
<p>Japanese General Iwane Matsui has recently toured Guangdong and Guangxi, meeting with various political and military leaders in South China. According to his recent talks, the mission of this trip is to discuss the "Asian League" issue with Chinese leaders. He has long advocated Pan-Asianism, and in his recent claims, he believes that the Sino-Japanese problem should be resolved from a Pan-Asian perspective. He said that China and Japan are the two major countries in the East and should first work together for peace in the Far East and world peace, and that he had also discussed the Asian League proposal with Mr. Sun Yat-sen, Mr. Hu Hanmin, and others. We do not know General Matsui's specific opinions. Is the so-called Sino-Japanese alliance the Sino-Japanese anti-communist military alliance and Sino-Japanese pseudo-economic cooperation in the Hirota Three Principles? Is the so-called Sino-Japanese problem to be solved from the perspective of Pan-Asianism the idea in the Hirota Three Principles that China is not allowed to use the power of Europe and the United States as a factor in solving Far Eastern problems? If so, then the so-called Pan-Asianism is no different from the Asian Monroe Doctrine, and the Asian League is no different from turning all of Asia into a territory of the Japanese Empire. As a member of the Asian nation and the most rational leader of the Asian movement, in view of the current situation and the other country's intentions, we dare not lightly show sympathy for this beautiful and poisonous proposition that does not match its name and reality.</p>
<p>It is said that the purpose of promoting Pan-Asianism was to unite Asian nations to resist the oppression of the Caucasian people and to seek the liberation, independence, and cooperation of Asian nations in order to promote and restore the glory of Asian culture. One year before the European War, Japanese political commentator Tokutomi Iichiro had a "White Peril" propaganda, and Marquis Okuma also believed that colored people must unite to resist white people. The Japanese ambassador to the United Kingdom, Hayashi Gonsuke, and the current Minister of Finance, Takahashi, both advocated that the Sino-Japanese alliance should be the first step to realize the Asian League. At the time when the western United States was most severely repelling Japanese and Chinese immigrants, the hope of Sino-Japanese people for racial unity became stronger. In the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, Mr. Sun Yat-sen gave a speech on "Greater Asianism" in Kobe when he went to Pingdao from Guangdong. Mr. Sun's idea was that Asianism should be built on the basic spirit of Asian civilization, namely benevolence, righteousness, and morality, and break the hegemonic concept of utilitarianism and power. Mr. Sun Yat-sen said that the problem to be solved by Greater Asianism is the cultural problem. Eastern culture is the way of kings, and Western culture is the way of hegemons. The way of kings is benevolence, righteousness, and morality, and the way of hegemons is utilitarianism and power. Speaking of benevolence, righteousness, and morality, we should use justice, principle, and affection to transform others. Speaking of utilitarianism and power, we should use foreign guns and cannons to oppress others. We advocate Asianism to fight injustice for the oppressed nations and to resist the culture of hegemony and seek a culture of equality and liberation for all people. In view of this, the current reality and Mr. Sun Yat-sen's ideal are far from each other.</p>
<p>Moreover, the reason why Japanese leaders in recent days have been talking about Pan-Asianism is not for the Asian nations themselves, but for the European and American powers. Japan's carefully considered plan is to drive the political, military, economic, and cultural forces of European and American countries out of the Asian continent, using the Suez Canal as the boundary between Japanese and European forces. The so-called Sino-Japanese alliance as the beginning of the Asian League is no different from saying that China should be turned into a Japanese protectorate and the beginning of Japan's rule over Asia. If Japan really intends to liberate the Asian nations, what is the current situation of the people of Korea and Taiwan? If Japan really intends to promote Asian culture, then Japan's military threat in China and the implementation of enslavement education in the four eastern provinces and eastern Hebei, which one is not hegemony, and which one is not "benevolence and loss of morality"? If Japan really intends to have economic mutual assistance, coexistence, and co-prosperity among Asian nations, then Japan's aggressive foreign trade policy in the Far East, its demands and actions that harm others and benefit itself, which one is not slaughtering Asian nations to enrich itself? Under such circumstances, talking about Pan-Asianism will only provoke resentment from Asian nations and further show Japan's cunning deception.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Finance Plans to Complete the Draft of the Inheritance Tax and Submit It for Discussion at Today's Meeting</h3>
<p>Nanjing: Inheritance tax is the best tax that best fits the modern social and economic theory among direct taxes.

<h3>To Cope with Future European Incidents, Italy Actively Expands Its Air Force, Manufacturing Military Aircraft Day and Night, Expecting to Increase to 5,000 by the End of This Year, French Troops Transfer to the Eastern Border to Consolidate Defense</h3>
<p>It was learned today that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini plans to build at least 1,500 aircraft by the end of this year, increasing Italy's air combat power to 5,500, of which at least 3,000 will be front-line aircraft. Aircraft factories are now working day and night, manufacturing five aircraft a day, most of which are Type 81 bombers, with a speed of 248 miles per hour, and can carry three tons of bombs. There are also several fighters and reconnaissance aircraft, with a speed of more than 400 kilometers per hour, and equipped with five rotating machine guns. These new aircraft will soon be incorporated into the domestic air force to replace the old aircraft, because 400 old aircraft have already been sent to the Abyssinia. Experts believe that Abyssinia has no defense against the Italian air force. Therefore, Italy is building these new aircraft to cope with possible events in Europe, and may not use them in the African war. (National telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Paris: On the eastern border of France, in the so-called Maginot Line area, the French army is making large-scale movements.

The existing strength of "Gardin Obu" will increase three or four times, which is the basic team of the future special army. The newspaper also said that this new army will be stationed in Lorraine for a long time, and can be mobilized at any time in times of danger.

According to unofficial sources, the A' soldiers attacked while the Italian soldiers were holding mass and praying, catching them off guard. Many were killed, but the A' soldiers did not harm the presiding priest. The Italian soldiers initially resisted, but then scattered. After returning to camp, the A' soldiers anticipated that the Italian army would retaliate, so they set up the captured Italian tents behind the lines and hid in the nearby mountains, watching from afar as Italian planes dropped bombs and bombarded their empty camp.

It also stated, "All issues related to the countries in the Danube River basin must seek fair and lasting solutions. However, in order to achieve this goal, there are several main conditions that must be fulfilled. Therefore, any difficulty that makes the main conditions difficult to fulfill or impossible to achieve, we must find ways to eliminate it. We have no hostile intentions towards any other country... This is true now, and it will be true in the future. We also believe that the countries in the Danube River basin, if they want to have beneficial mutual assistance, still need the assistance of other countries, and the assistance of the major countries in Central and Western Europe is very important," etc. Hodža also solemnly declared to the press that the organizational plan for the Danube River basin will naturally be implemented within the scope of the Little Entente alliance.

<h3>Aiming at China and Russia, the Japanese Kwantung Army Prepares for Reorganization, Chief of Staff Sugiyama Extends His Visit to China for Inspection, Strengthening the Garrison in North China to Be Realized This Summer</h3>
<p>Changchun - In view of the seriousness of military problems with Soviet Russia and China, the Japanese Army Ministry and General Staff Headquarters decided last week to send Chief of Staff Sugiyama himself to Manchuria to discuss the reorganization of the Kwantung Army with the Commander of the South Kwantung Army and Chief of Staff Nishio and other leaders. The aim is to strengthen the Japanese army stationed in "Manchuria" so that it is sufficient to cope with Soviet Russia and support the garrison in North China in emergency operations. Whether the Japanese divisions in "Manchuria" should be rotated or permanently stationed is now a matter for careful consideration to suit the current situation. The plan is to increase the Kwantung Army's military equipment, paying special attention to mechanical equipment and aviation. The Kwantung Army's military expenditure should also be sufficient. The reorganization plan is divided into two major principles: temporary and permanent, based on the draft plan previously agreed upon by Army Minister Kawashima and Director-General Koshikisho at the Army Ministry and General Staff Headquarters. The organization of the "Soviet Special Section" and the "Chinese Special Section" within the Kwantung Army will be strengthened and immediately put into effect. (Hualian, 24th)</p>

<p>Moscow - Kuren News: Today, another unit of the Japanese army set off for Lake Bor, the site of the recent Manchurian-Mongolian border conflict. This news has caused panic in Outer Mongolia that there will be new conflicts. (National News, 23rd)</p>
<p>Moscow - Japanese Ambassador Ota visited Deputy Foreign Commissar Stomonyakov on February 21 and said that the Japanese government could not accept the Soviet government's suggestion that a mixed committee to investigate the border dispute on January 30 should have representatives from neutral countries. Stomonyakov replied that the Soviet government still believed that the committee should have neutral and irrelevant representatives, as this would better show the truth. However, since the Japanese side could not accept this, the Soviet government regretted it, but for the sake of peace, it was still willing to fulfill the wishes of the Japanese government and agreed to a mixed committee composed of Soviet, Japanese, and "Manchurian" representatives to investigate. However, the composition of the committee must be based on the principle of equality, that is, the number of Soviet representatives should be equal to the number of Japanese and "Manchurian" representatives. Stomonyakov further stated that border conflicts between Manchuria and Mongolia are becoming more and more frequent, which is another new threat to peace in the Far East, and the Soviet government is very concerned about this. Stomonyakov also mentioned the Mongolian government's proposal at the Manzhouli Conference, saying that the Soviet government has maintained friendly relations with the Mongolian People's Republic since 1921 and has not changed. Therefore, it is willing for both Mongolia and Manchuria to establish a mixed committee to prevent and resolve all border disputes. The Japanese ambassador agreed to convey this intention to the government. (TASS, 23rd)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The Asahi Shimbun reported that the Russian Foreign Ministry, when talking to the Japanese ambassador to Russia about the establishment of a border committee, stated that Soviet Russia has an obligation to protect the independence of Outer Mongolia. The Russian government will persuade Outer Mongolia to accept the plan to establish a mixed committee to peacefully resolve the "Manchurian"-Mongolian border dispute. The Japanese ambassador asked what reasons Soviet Russia had for interfering in the Outer Mongolia issue. The Russian Deputy Foreign Ministry responded that Soviet Russia had helped Outer Mongolia in 1921 and therefore had an obligation to protect its independence. Soviet Russia believes that the stationing of foreign troops in the Outer Mongolia border area may endanger the security and order of the Russian border. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - On the 21st, Ambassador Ota to Russia met with Shlarinigovsky. The issue of establishing a joint investigation committee for the Jinshan Gou incident was resolved satisfactorily due to Russian concessions. During the talks, Ambassador Ota strongly advocated the importance of Outer Mongolia and "Manchukuo" establishing diplomatic relations and defining the Outer Mongolia border. The Russian side suddenly revealed the secret of the special relationship between Soviet Russia and Outer Mongolia, which it had kept secret, and stated as follows:</p>
<p>In order to resolve the Manchurian-Mongolian border disputes, it is hoped that a joint investigation committee similar to the Jinshan Gou incident will be established. If the Manchurian side has no objection, it is prepared to mediate with the Outer Mongolian side. Since 1921, Soviet Russia has been assisting Outer Mongolia, but Soviet Russia has an obligation to provide assistance because it protects its independence. This is also an indication of Soviet Russia's future active assistance. Therefore, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs promises to pay attention. (Dentsu, 24th)</p>
<h3>Sixteen Bridges Planned on the Yalu and Tumen Rivers to Facilitate Manchurian-Korean Transportation</h3>
<p>Changchun - The "Manchukuo" Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Civil Affairs, and the National Highway Bureau have been coordinating with the Japanese side since October of last year to build international bridges on the Yalu and Tumen Rivers on the "Manchurian"-Korean border.

The international bridges will be jointly funded by Japan and "Manchukuo," with each side building eight bridges, for a total of sixteen bridges on the two rivers. This will greatly facilitate Manchurian-Korean transportation. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<h3>The United States Insists on the Battleship Doctrine at the Naval Conference, Citing Two Reasons, Standing in Opposition to France's Stance</h3>
<p>London - The Daily Telegraph recently reported that the United States and France have conflicting opinions on the tonnage issue of battleships at the Naval Conference. France advocates a substantial reduction in this tonnage, while the United States insists on opposing it and has not changed its attitude. As a result, representatives from other countries are mostly disappointed with the attitude of the United States. According to the newspaper's observations, the United States believes that the amount of reduction proposed by France, with 27,000 tons as the maximum tonnage for battleships, is too large. According to past experience, although the United States built the "Washington" battleship after the Washington Naval Conference, its tonnage was less than 35,000 tons, but subsequent evidence proved that its effectiveness was not satisfactory. In view of this, the country's naval experts believe that the battleship tonnage must be set at 35,000 tons to meet the country's needs. There are two reasons: In modern warfare, in order to resist air strikes, battleships must have the necessary defensive capabilities. Due to geographical reasons, the United States' fleet must have great endurance. Only large battleships have this condition. This is the reason why the United States insists on the battleship doctrine. (Havas, 24th)</p>

<p>London - The Daily Telegraph in London published an interview with the new Spanish Prime Minister Azana by its Madrid correspondent. It said, "The majority of the Spanish people are unswervingly loyal to Republicanism. The national working class is also cooperating with us to solve the current major problems and jointly plan the implementation of new policies. This has been clearly revealed in the recent election results, and all nationals should be deeply convinced of this. Now that we have decided to take power again, we must implement the constitution and various laws based on the spirit of justice and freedom of belief. We will never destroy political enemies. This is also something that the people should understand," etc. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>Madrid - Socialist leader Pena was arrested and sentenced to death for participating in the October Revolution movement two years ago and is awaiting trial in prison. After the Left Party won a great victory in the House of Representatives election, the new government issued an amnesty order, and Pena was also among those pardoned. He regained his freedom last night and set off for here. More than 70,000 leftists in the capital formed a demonstration team to welcome him out of the city. This morning, Pena arrived in the vicinity of the city, Fuenjarara, and was carried on the shoulders of welcomers and paraded through the city. When he arrived at another place, the number of welcomers increased and increased, and the car could not move forward. Pena got out of the car and walked with the welcomers all the way to the capital. He thanked the welcoming people on the terrace of the Workers' Club and said, "We are not criminals and do not need to repent. Those who are investigating us may be arrested one day in the future. The prison we have left will be moved into by them," etc. (Havas, 23rd)</p>

<h3>U.S. Silver Faction Leaders Abandon the Movement to Raise Silver Prices</h3>
<p>Washington - Silver faction leaders indicated today that they have given up hope of making any further progress in raising the status of silver in this session of Congress. First, the government is eager for Congress to adjourn as soon as possible. Second, inflationists are eager to inflate the currency. Third, the Treasury Department is no longer interested in raising silver prices. Fourth, if the prices of metals such as copper, lead, and zinc cannot be raised, the mining of American silver mines will naturally be unprofitable. In this situation, the passage of any new legislation would be futile. Therefore, observers here believe that silver will no longer become an important issue, and it will not affect this year's election campaign except in a few western states. (National News, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Belgian Military System Reform, the Socialist Party Asks the Government to Organize a Special Committee to Study</h3>
<p>Belgian Capital - The government previously proposed a military system reform plan because it feared foreign insults and needed to take precautions. The plan advocated extending the period of military service and strengthening national defense forces. Since the plan was submitted to the House of Representatives, the attitude of the Socialist Party has been of most concern to the general public. If the party's members express opposition, the cabinet members affiliated with the party will resign, and the Chiran cabinet will also be shaken. The Socialist Party recently convened an extraordinary meeting on this issue. At that time, it was decided to ask the government to organize a special committee to take full responsibility for solving all military system issues. It also passed a resolution acknowledging that it is indeed possible for Belgium to wage war for self-defense. Therefore, it is necessary to take precautions, but unnecessary burdens should not be forced upon the working class. According to political sources, this resolution does not absolutely reject the government's military system reform plan. The request to set up a special committee is likely to be accepted by the government, as this will allow for extensive discussions on military system reform. According to this, whether a cabinet crisis can be avoided or postponed will depend on the situation of the House's vote on this bill. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3>National Socialist Party Youth League: This Year's Reorganization Plan - Children Under Sixteen Must Receive Adequate Training Before Joining the National Socialist Party as Members</h3>
<p>Berlin: Baldur von Schirach, leader of the national youth organizations, recently convened two thousand leaders of the "National Socialist Party Youth League" to announce the 1926 national youth organization reorganization plan, stating, "According to the current plan, within a few years, all children in the country will be raised and educated under the spirit of the National Socialist Party. Children will be required to receive four years of training in the 'Kindergarten League' until the age of twelve. Then, those with abundant abilities and strong physiques will be selected to join the 'National Socialist Party Youth League.' After another four years of training, they can join the National Socialist Party as members. The initiation ceremony will be held once a year on November 9th, with extremely solemn etiquette. Children with low abilities who cannot join the 'National Socialist Party Youth League' after four years of 'Kindergarten League' training will be organized into separate groups and guided by the 'National Socialist Party Youth League.' Those young people who cannot join the National Socialist Party's organization should not be regarded as disqualified. In the future, they can still take up a profession and fulfill their national responsibilities, but they cannot become leaders of the German people. As for those atheists who accuse the Youth League of blaspheming religion, we will answer them by saying that we also have our beliefs, pious and confident, to become citizens. This is our modern religion." (Havas dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<h3>Last Year's Chinese Trade Surplus Led by Cotton and Tung Oil</h3>
<p>Nanjing: An official from the Ministry of Finance stated that in December of last year, customs had a surplus of more than 1.4 million yuan, as reported by the Inspector General of Customs. Exports were led by cotton, followed by tung oil and peanuts. However, the total value of cotton exports is mostly a temporary phenomenon, as merchants from a certain country purchased large quantities in anticipation of high yarn prices and insufficient cotton stocks in China, planning to resell them to Chinese merchants at high prices when supplies run low. The sales market for tung oil can not only maintain its advantage now, but it is also predicted that there will be no risk of sluggish sales within ten years. Although the United Kingdom and the United States have recently promoted widespread tung tree planting, due to time constraints, they cannot produce in large quantities. On the other hand, its uses are expanding daily, such as in trains, ships, airplanes, automobiles, and everyday furniture, all of which require tung oil. Moreover, many chemical oils and preparations also require tung oil as a medium. Even if the United States can step up planting, it will not be easily replaced after ten years. While the trade surplus reduces leakages, the government's financial revenue will inevitably fall short due to the reduction in customs duties. Therefore, new legal taxes will be implemented to compensate for this. It is hoped that the business community will strive to make raw materials a trade surplus, and then proceed to manufactured goods to have a trade surplus. (Special dispatch, 24th)</p>

<p>— Jin Dui</p>
<p>Thirteen, Conversations and Songs at the Ningxia Sino-Arab Assembly</p>
<p>Teacher: What is our country?</p>
<p>Students: The Republic of China—the world's most ancient and civilized great nation.</p>
<p>Teacher: What is our religion?</p>
<p>Students: Islam—the religion of peace.</p>
<p>Teacher: What is the purpose of my teachings?</p>
<p>Students: Universal Compassion—to encourage people to do good and prevent them from doing evil.</p>
<p>Teacher: What should our attitude be towards our nation, people, and religion?</p>
<p>Students: We must protect them with our lives and absolutely not allow anyone to insult them.</p>
<p>Teacher: What is the relationship between religion and the nation and people?</p>
<p>Students: The nation and the people are the external defense of religion; religion is the internal assistance to the nation and the people. They complement each other and neither can be neglected.</p>
<p>Teacher: The founder of Islam teaches us that every male and female follower must seek knowledge throughout their lives. Is this "knowledge" defined narrowly or broadly?</p>
<p>Students: Broadly—it includes all kinds of writing and all scientific skills necessary for life.</p>
<p>Teacher: Who is the founder of this school?</p>
<p>Students: It is the current Chairman of the Ningxia Provincial Government, Ma Shaoyun.</p>
<p>Teacher: Why does Chairman Ma painstakingly donate his salary to establish this school?</p>
<p>Students: To cultivate scientific talents who are proficient in both Chinese and Arabic, to bridge Sino-Arab culture, to harmonize Han-Hui relations, to develop the Northwest, to consolidate national defense, to promote religious doctrines, to love people and save the country, and to realize the principle of universal compassion.</p>
<p>Teacher: How do we implement the Chairman's purpose?</p>
<p>Students: We will endure hardship and be hardworking, strengthen our bodies, enrich our minds, cultivate our character and study diligently, and will not rest until we achieve the Chairman's purpose.</p>
<p>The above ten question-and-answer conversations were compiled by Su, the director of the Ningxia Provincial First Sino-Arab School, mimeographed and distributed to the students. At every morning assembly, after the ceremony, the teachers and students recite it together. The general Hui people have a deep-rooted belief in religion, and it is probably at this time that the seedlings are cultivated. And is this concept of nation, people, and religion not correct?</p>
<p>It is said that the founder of Islam, Muhammad, preached with the Quran in his left hand and a sharp sword in his right. The devout Muslims, especially the Hui people in the Northwest, upholding the classic legacy of their ancestors, have cultivated a very full and strong spirit. The Ningxia Provincial First Sino-Arab School is specially established for the education of the Hui people. In addition to teaching Chinese, the school also teaches Arabic and Turkish scriptures. The Hui people of Ningxia are no different from those elsewhere, consistently upholding the habit of bravery. In particular, the young people gather in school every day to sing loudly. The melody is encouraging, and the singing is majestic. These songs were personally compiled by Ma Hongkui, the current commander-in-chief of the 15th Route Army and chairman of the provincial government. Chairman Ma is also the principal of the school. The lyrics are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Han and Hui originally belong to one family,</p>
<p>Only because of differing religious beliefs,</p>
<p>They have been divided into different households,</p>
<p>Separated and in disharmony with each other,</p>
<p>Leading to countless tragedies.</p>
<p>Abolish the old habits, restore the national identity!</p>
<p>Abolish the old habits, restore the national identity!</p>
<p>- National Anthem -</p>
<p>Our prophet Muhammad was pursued and besieged in Medina;</p>
<p>For self-defense, he aroused a fearless and martial spirit!</p>
<p>Braving arrows and stones, enduring pain,</p>
<p>Not retreating, but advancing!</p>
<p>Overcoming the many with the few, and succeeding in the end.</p>
<p>And the Crusaders repeatedly invaded the East,</p>
<p>But were ultimately defeated by our loyal and brave Muslims,</p>
<p>Seeking self-defense,</p>
<p>They were met head-on and utterly routed.</p>
<p>Only by being able to defend oneself can one survive!</p>
<p>Bring out this spirit,</p>
<p>To protect our motherland.</p>
<p>Expel the invaders, do not be excessive!</p>
<p>- Self-Defense Song -</p>
<p>Fourteen, Ningxia's Etiquette - Weddings, Funerals, and Seasonal Customs</p>
<p>Wedding customs:</p>
<p>Once a matchmaker has made contact, the birth dates of the man and woman must be checked for compatibility. Only if there are no clashes is the agreement finalized. For the engagement gift, the man's family uses colored silk, bracelets, or shuttle-woven cloth hairpins, and the woman's family responds with headdresses or needlework. Once the wedding date is set, the man's family prepares gift boxes with wine and fruit, and sends a guest to inform the woman's family, a custom called "sending the news." Subsequently, gifts of money, tea, fruit, lamb, wine, clothing, and jewelry are sent to the woman's family, a custom called "offering the betrothal gifts." Before the wedding, the woman's family prepares the dowry and sends it to the man's family, a custom called "laying the bed." On the auspicious day, the man's family also sends large steamed buns and fruit platters, along with a decorated sedan chair, to the woman's family, a custom called "urging the makeup." A female guest is invited to adorn the bride with hairpins and other ornaments, a custom called "crowning and girdling." The woman's family invites female guests to accompany the sedan chair to the man's family, a custom called "escorting the bride." Decorated sedan chairs and musical instruments are often used for the wedding procession. Poor families use carts. Wealthy families also have a custom of offering a goose as a gift and personally welcoming the bride. On the third day, the bride pays her respects to her parents-in-law at the temple, presenting them with needlework, preparing wine and food, and meeting the elders and juniors of the family, a custom called "distributing sizes." On the night of the wedding, the groom brings a box to the woman's family to pay respects to his wife's relatives, a custom called "thanking the relatives." The bride's relatives also reciprocate with visits. Originally, marriage did not depend on wealth. In the past, if anything was found, it was only a betrothal gift of a dozen or so gold pieces. Recently, the trend of heavy betrothal gifts has become very popular. Regardless of wealth, it requires hundreds of gold pieces. Even, the bizarre drama of bride-snatching is provoked by demanding heavy betrothal gifts. Extravagance and waste only deplete money. Given today's impoverished people and depleted wealth, if thrift is not promoted and frugality is not practiced, the trend of extravagance will inevitably worsen, and livelihoods will be exhausted. The provincial government, aware of this, has planned to first implement this among public officials, to eliminate long-standing habits, and to do its best to encourage the public to gradually become frugal and develop clean habits.</p>
<p>Funeral customs:</p>
<p>Etiquette and customs place the greatest emphasis on wearing mourning attire. Hats and shoes mostly follow ancient systems. Hemp scarves and mourning clothes must be changed only after the Great Mourning period. However, for those below the period of filial piety, most now opt for simplicity and are unable to fully follow the ancient rites. The major funeral is held on the seventh day. Many relatives and friends attend the wake. On the day before the funeral, relatives and friends each bring memorial gifts to offer sacrifices. The bereaved family prepares wine and food in return. Each time food or soup is served, the filial son must come out to kowtow, and the etiquette for expressing gratitude is very tedious. Those who are weak are often exhausted. In Zhongwei, Lingwu, and other counties, the custom of sending off the funeral procession is particularly popular. Men and women often number in the dozens or hundreds. In order to prepare wine, food, and carriages, the bereaved family, knowing that they are weak and unable to do so, may even leave the coffin for decades without daring to hold a funeral. According to legend, during the Ming Dynasty, in the fortresses near the border, bandits often spied on funerals to rob clothing and valuables. Therefore, many relatives by marriage had to be invited to make preparations. Today, hundreds of years later, the story of guarding against bandits has turned into a burden for the bereaved family, which can be considered a joke.</p>
<p>Seasonal customs:</p>
<p>On "New Year's Day", people get up early, dress properly, light incense and candles, and pay respects to heaven, earth, and ancestors. Juniors pay respects to elders and visit relatives and friends, a custom called "paying New Year's greetings." Meals are prepared for three days in advance, a custom called "New Year's meals." On the fourth day, fresh rice is cooked. At the third watch (around midnight), iron or charcoal is lit and placed in a basin. Vinegar is poured on it while walking around the room, saying auspicious words to ward off misfortune. The basin is then overturned outside the gate, a custom called "driving away the vinegar spirits," also known as "sending away the five poverties." At dawn on the fifth day, the accumulated dirt on the ground is swept away, and incense and petitions are prepared to be sent out into the street. In the countryside, they must be sent to the main road, a custom also called "sending away the five poverties." This day is very restrictive. Unless they are close relatives, people do not visit each other. After dusk on the seventh day, young boys and girls, holding cakes and burning incense, go to the street to call out to each other. In the countryside, they call out outside the door or eat noodles and cakes while striking copper instruments, a custom called "calling the souls." On the "Lantern Festival", people eat glutinous rice balls. For three nights before and after, the streets are decorated with colorful lanterns, with names such as pavilion lanterns, archway lanterns, and turtle mountain lanterns. They are made of paper, and recently glass lanterns have also been used, illuminating the streets like daylight, and the crowds are very crowded. People also pre-make clay statues of Qin Gui and his wife and place them on the main streets. The clay statues are hollow and filled with firewood, which is burned all day long, a custom called "burning Qin Gui." At night, groups of women go to visit and touch the long tongue and arms and feet of the Qin Gui statue, a custom called "visiting hundreds of illnesses." For four or five days before and after the Lantern Festival, people dress up as colorful-faced figures or tall earth gods. Another person dresses up as a woman and walks ahead with a broom, also to sweep away misfortune, beating gongs and drums and parading in the streets, a custom called "community celebration." On the evening of the twenty-third, families pile tribulus thorns outside the door, burn them with fire, and sprinkle salt grains. The old and young jump over them, a custom called "burning the scabies." After the fire is extinguished, the ashes are scattered, a custom called "six grain flowers," to predict a good harvest. On the second day of the second month, families stir-fry various kinds of beans, millet, wheat, and grains and eat them, a custom called "frying smelly bugs." On this day, the oven cakes made on New Year's Day are gathered with the whole family, old and young, and eaten in the courtyard, a custom called "reunion cake," with the good meaning of family reunion throughout the year. From the first Ding day of the second month to Qingming, people choose an auspicious day, prepare livestock and paper flags, and go to worship at the graves, called "repairing the ancestral tombs." On the twenty-eighth day of the third month, the Dongyue Temple Fair outside the East Gate lasts for three days. Various goods are sold in the city. Old people are helped and children are led along, one after another on the road. There are indeed many who burn incense, and those who visit are also not few. It is very lively, and the roads are crowded. On the eighth day of the fourth month, the washing ceremony of the Shangta Temple outside the West Gate gathers old men and women on the road, even more than Dongyue Temple. On the eighth day, monks and nuns in various temples hold a bathing Buddha ceremony, and women all go to worship. On "Dragon Boat Festival," people paste talismans, insert calamus and mugwort leaves, drink realgar wine, eat rice dumplings, and send each other talismans made of colorful silk and cut mugwort tigers. On the sixth day of the fifth month, it is said that storing water to make noodles on this day will not rot for a month. During mid-autumn "Qixi", unmarried girls display needlework, tea, fruit, and conduct a skills display, and there are also group dances, a custom called "dancing skills." On the fifteenth day of the seventh month, the Binta Fair outside the North Gate attracts many tourists. On "Mid-Autumn Festival", people worship the moon, prepare mooncakes, and display melons and fruits. Every household does this. Mooncake banquets and melon markets spread throughout the streets and alleys. If a family has a pregnant woman during Mid-Autumn Festival, the woman cuts the melon used to worship the moon into the shape of battlements. If there is an odd number, it means a boy; if there is an even number, it means a girl, to predict the birth. On "Double Ninth Festival", people eat cakes and drink chrysanthemum wine, and some also hold climbing gatherings. In the late autumn, wine is brewed on the ninth day, called "electricity sun wine." In this month, vegetables are picked and salted to prepare for winter food. On the "Winter Solstice" day, people worship their ancestors, and family members and friends pay New Year's greetings to each other. They make soup with meat, powder, and tofu, and drink it with wine, a custom called "brain wine." The winter solstice marks the birth of the first yang, which means that things have a head and brains. On "Laba" (the eighth day of the twelfth month), people cook porridge mixed with beans and meat, called "Laba porridge." In the early part of this month, water is taken to brew wine, called "Laba wine." On the twenty-third night, chickens, wine, cakes, and sweets are used to worship the stove god. The chicken is displayed but not killed, and it is cooked only until New Year's Eve, called "welcoming the stove." On "New Year's Eve", people paste spring couplets, change door gods, prepare wine and dishes, worship their ancestors, pay respects to their elders, burn incense and firecrackers, and light lamps all night, a custom called "staying up for the New Year." On this evening, unmarried women fill cups with dates, persimmons, sesame seeds, and mixed vegetables with tea leaves, and offer them to their parents-in-law and honored guests, a custom called "thick tea women's feast", as a sign of respect. The new bride pays respects to her parents-in-law, and needlework is also very important, with many offering over a hundred cups, each costing dozens of coins. It is said to have originated in the Ming Dynasty Prince's Mansion and has not changed to this day.</p>
<h3>Shanxi Province Establishes Legal Tender Exchange Office to Help Merchants and Residents Exchange Money Outside the Province; Central Bank Establishes Branch in Taiyuan</h3>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence. Since the implementation of the legal tender policy by the central government last year, the financial situation in Shanxi Province has appeared quite calm on the surface, but there have been many undercurrents. Initially, the financial affairs of Shanxi Province were controlled by the four state-run banks: Shanxi Provincial Bank, Suixi Reclamation Bank, Railway Bank, and Salt Industry Bank. Only one branch of the Bank of China was located in Taiyuan among the external financial institutions. Therefore, after the implementation of the legal tender policy, the amount of currency circulating in the market was very small, and the merchants and residents had a very shallow understanding of the credibility and identification of legal tender. As a result, the financial market in Taiyuan was divided into two distinct categories: provincial currency and legal tender. For example, when exchanging 1,000 yuan of legal tender for 1,000 yuan of provincial currency, a surcharge of 10 to 20 yuan was often required. Because the Bank of China in Taiyuan has always adopted a conservative approach, except for lending more than 3 million yuan to the Yujue Jin Hua Yarn Factory, it only engaged in a small amount of remittance business, and it can be said that it did not interact with local merchants and residents. Therefore, the decisions of the financial market in the market were purely shifted to the state-run four banks. Until recently, although provincial currency was still circulating smoothly within the province, the Bank of China refused to accept it for external remittances, and other banks required a remittance fee of 10 to 20 yuan per 1,000 yuan, while legal tender only charged a handling fee of 1 yuan per 1,000 yuan. At this point, there was a clear distinction between provincial currency and legal tender. Yan Xishan repeatedly convened meetings with financial figures to discuss rescue measures for this problem. It was recently decided that the government would establish a legal tender exchange office. All merchants and residents who want to remit money outside the province must first explain the purpose and amount and submit them to the government for approval. Then, they can exchange provincial currency for legal tender and hand it over to the office for remittance on their behalf. The handling fee is also only 1 yuan per 1,000 yuan. The office is attached to the Provincial Bank and has been operating for several days. However, since the establishment of the office, all other ordinary banking businesses have complied with the order to stop remittances. Only this office handles remittances. Since the trial operation, officials and businessmen have felt many inconveniences. On the morning of the 20th, Yan convened a financial meeting at the Sui Office. Chairman Yan held a detailed discussion on the remittance matters of the Legal Tender Exchange Registration Office of the Financial Committee. Because all banks and money shops in the city have stopped remittance transactions since the establishment of the exchange office, and all banks and money shops have concentrated their remittance businesses in Yujue and other places due to business relations, it is now decided to allow merchants to continue to handle remittance transactions in order to maintain the interests of the banks and money shops in the city. However, the market price should be changed once every ten days. Each time the market price is changed, the list of market prices should be submitted to the Financial Committee for approval. In addition, because a large amount of foreign goods is imported into the province every year, resulting in a huge outflow of money, if this continues, the province will inevitably decline. In order to save the province's economy and develop the province's products, it is planned to implement measures to increase revenue and reduce expenditure, so that the province's products can be sold abroad as much as possible, so that the outflow of economy can be gradually reduced. Yan also intends to formulate measures for this problem, which will be studied in detail by the members of the Financial Committee, and the banks and money shops in the city will be ordered to hold meetings to discuss specific measures in detail. After the meeting, the Money Industry Association immediately convened a general meeting to discuss specific measures. In addition, the Central Bank has decided to set up a branch in Taiyuan in the near future to facilitate the implementation of the new currency system, and is currently actively preparing for it.

<h3>Fujian Province Implements Prohibition of Opium Poppy Seedlings; Taiwanese-Owned Opium Dens and Gambling Houses Will Also Be Closed</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence. Qiu Hongjun, the special envoy of the Military Affairs Commission for banning opium in Fujian, arrived in Fuzhou on February 14 with his entourage, established an office in Tangbing Lane, and appointed Zhou Shengtao as secretary, and Zhang Jinsheng and Qiu Binshi as office staff. The office officially started operations on the 16th and decided to establish a sub-office in each administrative supervision area. The heads of the sub-offices will be announced within days. In the future, the special envoy's office, the Department of Civil Affairs, the Security Department, and the Administrative Commissioner's Office will each send a special commissioner to ban opium seedlings in each administrative area, and they will go to the counties in the area to conduct on-the-spot investigations to see if opium is being planted. Special Envoy Qiu himself is also scheduled to depart for inspections in early next month, first to eastern Fujian, and then to southern Fujian (because the counties in eastern and southern Fujian have always been the places where opium seedlings are most heavily planted), but the whereabouts and dates will be kept absolutely secret and will not be entertained by local officials. At the same time, the security teams of the Security Command will assist in strictly banning opium seedlings. If the special envoy requests the dispatch of teams to accompany the investigation, they should comply immediately and must not refuse. The registration of opium addicts in the counties of the province was completed at the end of last year. The Department of Civil Affairs should now be receiving reports from the counties one after another. It is estimated that there are more than 80,000 opium addicts. However, the Military Affairs Commission is afraid that the number of opium addicts is still missing. A circular was sent to Fujian a few days ago, stating that opium addicts who have not registered and obtained licenses should still be ordered to complete registration. If they dare to disobey orders and try to escape, they will be severely punished and not pardoned. As for the opium dens opened by Taiwanese people in Fuzhou, there are about 300, and there are about 70 gambling houses. The provincial government previously negotiated with the Japanese Consul and asked them to ban them. With the consent of the Japanese Consul, all of them were to be completely cleaned up by February 20. The Japanese Consul sent police chief Danhou to notify all opium dens and gambling houses together with the Taiwanese police. Now that the deadline has passed, the opium dens and gambling houses in the city and Taiwan are still open as usual, and they jointly submitted a request to the Japanese Consulate to extend the period in order to seek other means of livelihood. The Japanese Consul, considering that the requests made by the people of various nationalities may have difficulties, intends to change the way they are handled and extend the deadline to the end of this month to completely stop operations.

<h3>Kunshan: Social Education Institutions Ordered to Close</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Authorities have decided to implement citizen training and have ordered social education institutions in various counties to close within a set time limit. It is reported that the county's Bureau of Education recently received an order from the province, ordering social education institutions to close by March 15 and wait for reorganization. After receiving the order, the Bureau of Education has instructed all institutions to comply with the deadline. Director Pan Mingfeng made a special trip to the province to request instructions on everything the day before yesterday and has now returned to Kunshan after completing his official duties.</p>
<h3>Confucius Ceremony to Be Held Regularly</h3>
<p>The Confucius ceremony in this county has been abandoned for a long time since 1927. Local gentry Dai Renlong and others, seeing that the Confucius Temple was renovated and completed last autumn, taking on a completely new look, should continue to hold the ceremony to show respect for Confucius. It is specifically scheduled to be held at 8:00 am on the 25th of this month. The ceremony will be extremely grand. All those who were formerly listed in the Confucian school and current educational personnel will participate in the ceremony.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Enthusiastic Training for Jia Leaders</h3>
<p>The county government of this county, in order to enable the Jia leaders in each district to thoroughly understand the meaning of the Baojia system and to improve the administrative efficiency of the Bao system, has specially formulated Baojia rules in accordance with the simple rules of the Baojia leader training institutes in various counties in Jiangsu Province, dividing the entire county into 169 Jia leader training institutes. In the first district, 11 institutes have been established and have started classes one after another last week. The Jia leaders who came to the institutes for training were extremely enthusiastic. The county government hired famous people to give lectures on common sense of citizenship, Baojia knowledge, Party ideology, and the New Life Movement, and their words were mostly alert, moving the listeners. As of yesterday, they have graduated one after another and received training certificates. In the second district, 24 institutes have been established and started training yesterday (the 24th). The other eight districts, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, will start classes next month.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Illegal Collection of Slaughter Tax Accusation</h3>
<p>The former Slaughter Tax Collection Office in Wujin County was accused of illegally collecting taxes, issuing receipts indiscriminately, and failing to affix stamps to the Financial Department. The document stated that the Wujin County Slaughter Tax Collection Office was illegally collecting taxes. Please order the county to thoroughly investigate and severely punish the greedy, as it concerns the merchants and residents of Sanhekou Town, District 5, Wuyi County, who have lived in the area for generations and are content to do business without interfering in external affairs. On August 1, 1933, they took over the business of Qia Chang Fresh Meat Store, which was originally opened by Li Xikui in this town, and continued to operate the business after they obtained a license on their own in 1934. However, Zhang Jinsheng, Liu Baineng, and Qiu Yifeng (who is on the run), the former directors of the tax collection office in this county, and the collectors Wang Youcheng, Ye Canjin, and Zhang Hanshou, conspired together, manipulated from above and below, and did not issue formal licenses for the taxes collected from various merchants. Those who had paid taxes were only given temporary receipts as proof, and the receipts were issued indiscriminately without any limit. The slaughter tax is related to the national budget. The collecting agency should issue licenses according to the regulations for the taxes paid by the merchants. However, Zhang Jinsheng and others did not change the licenses after collecting taxes in the past two years, and the receipts they gave did not have stamps affixed in accordance with the regulations. Their greed and trickery are the same as extortion and are extremely sinful. If they are not presented for severe punishment, how can greed be deterred and obedience be promoted? Therefore, they were forced to submit three collection receipts for inspection. Please, Your Honor, review and verify them, and promptly order the Wujin County Government to thoroughly investigate the evidence of Zhang Jinsheng's and others' crimes, severely punish them according to law, so as to deter greed and promote obedience, which is truly for the public good.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Nantong District Commissioner Resigns</h3>
<p>Xu Zhen, the administrative inspector commissioner of the Nantong District, came to Nantong last autumn and has been here for half a year. Recently, he suddenly had the intention to resign and firmly resigned to the provincial government. The commissioner's office and the district security command have both been closed. Ge Tan, who was appointed by the provincial government as the new commissioner, will arrive in Nantong at the end of the month.</p>
<h3>Escort Fishing Team to Practice on the Sea</h3>
<p>The provincial government transferred the Water Police Team to the coastal area to protect the fishermen. In order to prevent the intrusion of sea bandits, a special escort fishing team was formed, and fishermen were also recruited to join the training. Now that the fishing season is approaching, they will first go to the sea to practice. The Department of Civil Affairs will also transfer the Junhe and Ce Dian police ships to Nantong in the coming days to assist in escorting fishing and suppressing bandits.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Zhejiang and Jiangxi Special Product Exchange Exhibition</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has now been opened to Nanchang, which makes the transportation and sales of special products from the two provinces very convenient. The industrial and commercial enterprises can develop more and more. The Zhejiang Provincial Bureau of Commerce and the Jiangxi Provincial Chamber of Commerce have jointly initiated the holding of a Zhejiang-Jiangxi special product exchange exhibition. Zhejiang Province will exchange silk, tea, ham, scissors and other special products with Jiangxi Province's porcelain, ramie cloth and other special products for the exhibition. It has also been agreed with the Railway Bureau that the transportation of exhibits will be free of charge. The measures have now been drafted, and both parties will hold the exhibition at the same time.</p>
<h3>The Mainland Bank Employee Embezzles Public Funds</h3>
<p>Zang Zhongsan, the agent of the Xinda Public Debt Trading Department attached to the Mainland Bank in Baoyoufang, Hangzhou, was originally the manager of the Hengjiu Qianzhuang in Hangzhou. Recently, the Zhuang closed down and liquidated due to the decline in public debt prices. Unexpectedly, the Mainland Bank discovered that Zang conspired with Cheng and Wu, employees of the bank, to purchase 200,000 yuan of public debt in the name of customers. Manager Shi Qiansun verified that Zang and others did have embezzlement and fraudulent acts, and has submitted a request to the Public Security Bureau to detain Gan Wu and sue the court to recover the losses. Zang had already fled far away upon hearing the news.</p>
<h3>Bengbu: Rickshaw Pullers Demand Reduced Donations</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of rickshaw pullers demanding reduced donations, the Public Security Bureau has received an order from the province to reduce the donation by two corners from February, and collect one yuan per month per vehicle. The outstanding donations for January must still be paid. In addition to notifying the Rickshaw Pullers Union to comply, the Public Security Bureau also issued an order to pay the donations and receive licenses before the 20th of this month. However, in recent days, only a small number of rickshaw pullers have received licenses. On the 21st, the Public Security Bureau specially ordered the police stations to check the rickshaw licenses. Those without licenses were ordered to stop business immediately. In the afternoon, rickshaw pullers came to the Public Security Bureau one after another to petition, demanding to pay eight corners as before. Within two hours, more than a hundred people gathered. The Public Security Bureau was deeply afraid of causing a disturbance and sent Gong Yunong, the chief of the administrative section, to summon the rickshaw pullers to persuade them sincerely. The rickshaw pullers still demanded to pay eight corners. Later, Chen Taichang, the secretary of the Bengbu Huai County Party Department, came out to mediate. As a result, the rickshaw donation was temporarily paid at eight corners. After the Public Security Bureau reported the situation to the Provincial Government, a clear order will be awaited before handling it.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Italy During Wartime (Part Two) - Observation Three of the European Situation Under the Shadow of Killing Intent</h3>
<p>— Written by Lluis Fisher, Translated by Bin Fu</p>
<p>Milan is the largest industrial city in Northern Italy, with a population of 900,000. It can be said to be the birthplace of Fascism. The most important Fascist daily newspapers are not published in Rome, but in Milan, such as "Il Popolo d'Italia," founded by Mussolini himself, now edited by his nephew; and the famous Gayda of "Corriere della Sera," who mocks Britain in the paper every day. The Milanese Fascists also have their "slogans," which they scribble with pencils on scraps of paper. They write things like W Il Duce (Long Live Mussolini), M M’Aden (Death to Eden), M L’Inghilterra (Death to England), etc. I saw "Death to Eden" twice; "Death to Negus" twice (Negus is the King of Abyssinia) -- the King is said to be largely ignored; and "Death to England" once. Sometimes I also saw W. Binda on walls or slogans. Later, I asked others and found out that Binda was actually a winner of a cycling championship.</p>
<p>Slogans have become a popular thing in modern Rome, but no one sees slogans like "Long Live Lenin," "Long Live Stalin," or "Long Live Moscow" that were once found in 1919. Where have the millions of Communists and revolutionaries that Mussolini claimed to have saved Italy from gone? Many have been "purged," imprisoned, or exiled. Many have completely changed. Those who have not yet changed may be fearing or waiting for their opportunity. Under oligarchy, unorganized opposition is ineffective. Reason sometimes governs political struggles, and it seems too early to write Communist slogans on Fascist leaflets.</p>
<p>The Fascists are trying to take advantage of every opportunity to exploit anti-British sentiment and sanctions. If great economic difficulties arise later, it should not be blamed on Fascism or the war, but only on Britain and Geneva. The following passage from a Fascist group's warning to citizens in the form of slogans can be seen everywhere.</p>
<p>"Milanese, in the seventeenth year of the World War, we see that the proletarian Fascist Italy has risen up and gathered under her King and her Prime Minister; her defense of the sacred right to exist is invincible, and her determination to win is invincible. Soldiers, Blackshirts, Milanese! After Italy suffered 670,000 deaths and 400,000 injuries in the World War, Geneva launched a huge sanctions mechanism, endangering our conquest of the 'land under the sun.' Resist this attack on our survival and prestige! For justice and culture, let us strengthen our unwavering will. Long live Italy, Long live the Emperor, Long live the Prime Minister."</p>
<p>A team of sailors dragged a few light cannons down the road, led by a Blackshirt who blew a whistle to attract people's attention. Only one old man raised his hand in a "Caesar" salute. The passing crowds did not stop to watch. Generally speaking, no one felt the tension in the air. There was no air of war around. At the border, my luggage was not opened, and the border authorities and hotel inspectors did not pay much attention to my passport. In the church square, there was a team of twenty or so Fascists, wearing various uniforms, short swords at their waists, and cloaks over their shoulders, loitering there - I saw them in the morning, and when I returned after a long detour around the border, I still saw this "original team." They seemed to have nothing to do except attract attention or joke with each other. They laughed, smoked, and sometimes twisted each other on the back, only their military uniforms might make people think that Italy was engaged in war – certainly not because of their attitude. My impression is that the Fascists, or even the national population, still regard the conquest of Abyssinia as a large-scale national "picnic." They don't take it seriously. In fact, this is just the beginning of the difficulty.</p>
<p>Today I spoke with a large textile manufacturer. He said that most of the textile factories in Milan have cotton stockpiles that cannot last for more than a month. They currently have no way to obtain new supplies. All of the government's foreign currency and gold are used to store large quantities of oil. A felt hat factory near Milan only has enough raw materials to last for two weeks. Wool and cotton cannot be imported in large quantities. I also asked him about the Fascist cooperative organization. "That is absolutely unreliable," he replied, "Mussolini just wants to use it as a threat to control us. The state management is harsh, but our capital is still our own." In any case, he is a fierce anti-Fascist. He hates this control. He predicts that sanctions will cause serious unemployment in the near future.</p>
<p>The government is encouraging the people to raise a new 5% war bond. One bond-raising poster depicts a soldier with a rifle, wearing a Napoleonic hat and hobnailed boots. He is guarding a plough on Abyssinian soil. Another depicts a soldier carrying many ploughs. The intention is to tell the people that the troops on the East African expedition will not be coming back. They will stay to cultivate the fields of Abyssinia, thus saving Italy's overpopulation. We'll have to wait and see about that. There has never been a precedent for large-scale colonization of tropical Africa by whites. A third bond-raising poster depicts an Italian officer saluting with his son, who is dressed as a Boy Scout, the meaning of the slogan is, "For your children, donate some!"</p>
<p>After work, I ran to the cinema. The cinema was dark, so people could freely express their feelings inside. The first act was a newsreel. A ship full of soldiers set sail for Eritrea. No one in the audience applauded. A tank charged up a small hill in Asmara; no one applauded. General De Bono inspected Italian troops near Adowa; one person applauded, but after a sudden silence, there was a sharp uproar, which was actually worse than no applause at all. Soldiers sent their wages home. No one applauded.</p>
<p>I asked an Italian artist why he didn't go to Abyssinia. He said, "Let others fight." I asked the same question to a hotel clerk. He said, "Let those who have nothing to do go to war." He thought the war was just like a public works project. The whole country seems to have little enthusiasm for the war. Sanctions and the opposition of countries around the world have given the Fascists an opportunity to stir up national patriotism. But two months of sanctions and the possibility of an oil embargo have chilled the Fascists.</p>

<h3>Local News: Eurasia Company Opens New Beijing-Yunnan Route, Today's Test Flight, China Aviation Re-schedules Kunming-Chongqing Route</h3>
<p>Huadong News Agency reports that the Eurasia Aviation Company, under orders, has been preparing the new Beijing-Yunnan air route, and preparations are now complete. A test flight will be dispatched from Shanghai this morning (25th) to assess its feasibility, and the opening date will be determined accordingly. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Giant Aircraft Departs, Four Accompany</p>
<p>A Huadong News Agency reporter met with Mr. Cha Zhenhu, the company secretary, yesterday afternoon. Mr. Cha stated that the company received an order from the Ministry of Communications at the end of last year to plan and open a new Beijing-Yunnan air route from the capital to Yunnan. After receiving the telegram, the company immediately began research. After several considerations by General Manager Li (Jingcong), it was deemed necessary to open the route, and preparations for the test flight were actively carried out. All preparation procedures have now been completed. It has been decided that at 6:30 AM tomorrow (today), the first giant Junkers Ju 52 aircraft (now renamed Eurasia No. 15) will depart from Longhua Airport for the test flight. General Manager Li originally intended to accompany the flight for inspection, but is currently very busy with official duties. Therefore, in addition to dispatching German pilot Mr. Kester to pilot the aircraft, the following personnel will also accompany the flight at that time: Mr. Liao Guanxuan, Director of the Company's Operations Department, Mr. Yang Xingzhong, Director of the Xi'an Station, and Mr. Xu Tiemin, a radio operator, for a total of four people.</p>
<p>Tomorrow Morning From Chengdu, Fly to Yunnan</p>
<p>After the aircraft departs this morning, it will pass through Nanjing, Zhengzhou, Xi'an, and Hanzhong along the way. It is scheduled to arrive in Chengdu at 5:00 PM. After overnighting, it will take off from Chengdu again at 8:00 AM tomorrow morning, and after passing through Guiyang, it will go directly to Kunming in Yunnan. According to Mr. Cha, previous rumors about the Eurasia Company's Beijing-Yunnan test flight route being from Shanghai to Beijing, and then departing from Beijing at dawn on the 26th, directly advancing towards Yunnan, are false rumors. The new Beijing-Yunnan route passes through Nanjing, Nanchang, Changsha, Guiyang, Kunming, and other five stations. Because Nanjing, Nanchang, and Changsha already have the company's original airports and air stations, and have also been flown before, there is no need to conduct another test flight. Therefore, the giant aircraft's departure today will follow the Shanghai-Xinjiang-Shaanxi-Chengdu routes and fly to Chengdu for the night. Tomorrow, the new Guiyang-Kunming air route will be test flown.</p>
<p>Official Opening, No Definite Date</p>
<p>As for the official opening of the Beijing-Yunnan route, there is currently no definite date. It depends on the results of the test flight. Because there are many mountains and the climate is unpredictable on this route, there is no standard for how long it will take to complete the entire route in one day in the future. As for the Guiyang and Kunming airports and airfields, they are currently under construction. Passenger ticket prices and postage fees are also being drafted.</p>
<p>Kunming-Chongqing Route, Revised Date</p>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports that China National Aviation Corporation has announced a revised schedule for the Kunming-Chongqing air route. The Chongqing-Guiyang route has been changed to twice a week, on Tuesdays and Thursdays, with three round trips each. The Chongqing-Kunming route has been changed to one round trip per week. The changes have already been implemented starting this week.</p>
<h3>Two British Visiting Aircraft, Delayed in Wenzhou Yesterday Due to Fog, If Weather Improves Today, May Arrive in Shanghai at Noon, Will Land on the Riverfront in Front of the Yangshupu Fish Market</h3>
<p>Xinxin News Agency reports that three British Royal Air Force visiting aircraft have been delayed in flying to Shanghai due to weather conditions. At 12:00 PM yesterday, according to the British Air Force Attache Office, of the three aircraft, one remained in Xiamen due to mechanical damage, while the other two had departed from Gulangyu, Xiamen, at 10:00 AM yesterday to come to Shanghai. It was scheduled to arrive on the riverfront in front of the Yangshupu Fish Market before 5:00 PM in the afternoon. After receiving the news, people from all walks of life went to welcome them. However, at 3:00 PM in the afternoon, the British Air Force Attache received a telegram from the aircraft, stating that due to fog and unfavorable weather along the way, they had landed 15 miles from Wenzhou at 2:00 PM in the afternoon. If the weather improves tomorrow (today), they are scheduled to fly to Shanghai at noon. After hearing the news, the welcoming personnel dispersed. When the aircraft arrive in Shanghai today, the municipal government and the British Consulate will send personnel to the fish market to welcome them. Those who wish to visit can obtain a visiting pass from the information office of the municipal government or from the British Air Force Attache Office at Room 217, 2nd Floor, Sassoon House, Nanjing Road. Otherwise, they will not be allowed to enter.</p>
<h3>Taikoo Company Plans to Dispatch Aircraft to Fly to Outer Dagukou, To Provide Fuel and Food Supplies</h3>
<p>Outer Dagukou has been frozen again since the 17th of this month, with the ice reaching 400 nautical miles. There are 26 or 27 ships surrounded by solid ice. Those that cannot be rescued include Taikoo Company's Ganzhou, Yingzhou, Huizhou, Zhejiang, and Chongqing ships. The Shengjing ship was blocked and diverted to Yantai. The Yuezhou ship and Jardine Matheson's Rising Sun ship, China Merchants Shunli and other ships, and a total of six Japanese ships, were blocked overseas and cannot break through the ice. What is most worrying now is the fuel and food. It is stipulated that ocean-going ships have regulations for burning coal and food. The crew members of the ships blocked in the icy sea have been there for at least a week, and their food and beverages have been used up. They are about to starve to death surrounded by ice, and the attempt to break the ice has also failed. The British Taikoo Company in this port, after receiving this report, is planning a rescue. It has decided to contact the airline and intends to dispatch aircraft from Shanghai, loaded with food and fresh water, to fly to Outer Dagukou to provide supplies to the ocean-going ships. Once the agreement is reached, aircraft will be dispatched from Shanghai in the next day or two to rescue the trapped crew members.</p>

<h3>China Farmers Bank Will Increase Land Mortgage Loans, New Banknotes Have Been Shipped in Three Batches</h3>
<p>The China Farmers Bank has been approved by the Ministry of Finance to issue 100 million yuan in new banknotes, which were ordered from the United Kingdom and delivered in installments. Three batches have already arrived, and the bank is adding printing and signatures. It is scheduled to be issued at the beginning of next month.

<p>Equal Use with Legal Tender</p>
<p>The China Farmers Bank's issuance of 100 million yuan in new banknotes was previously approved by the Ministry of Finance. When the Ministry of Finance issued an order to implement the legal currency policy, taking the banknotes of the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications as legal currency, and ordering other banks to stop issuing, the bank submitted a report to the Ministry for instructions. It was then ordered to allow the issuance, equal to legal currency, and to allow the acquisition of the issuing rights of local banks, in order to concentrate authority.</p>
<p>New Banknotes Arrive, Exquisite Designs</p>
<p>The new banknotes include denominations of one yuan, five yuan, and ten yuan. They were ordered from the De La Rue banknote company in the United Kingdom. Three batches have already arrived, including 10 million yuan in five-yuan banknotes. The last batch of 2.5 million yuan arrived in Shanghai on the 18th and is currently stored in the Customs warehouse. Yesterday, a passport was issued by the Ministry, and personnel have been sent to the Customs to retrieve it. The new banknote designs feature a bushel of grain on the front left and a rice-threshing scene on the right. On the reverse, there is a plowing ox on the left and a cow's head watermark on the right. The national emblem is very exquisitely crafted. The bank has distributed sample copies to the provincial and municipal governments, banks, and chambers of commerce for inspection.</p>
<p>Will Handle Rural Land Mortgages</p>
<p>The bank recently received an order from the Ministry of Finance to handle 50 million yuan in farmer loans to revitalize rural areas. The bank is currently planning to implement this. At the same time, it will increase rural land mortgage loans to enrich the rural economy. It is reported that since its opening, the bank has focused on rural loans. Therefore, its branches and offices are located in 53 locations in provinces such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Fujian, Sichuan, Gansu, Shaanxi, Jiangxi, and Yunnan. It also guides farmers in various villages to establish cooperative societies to facilitate loans.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank Expands Savings and Loan Pledges, and Adds 100 Agricultural Warehouses</h3>

In order to relieve agriculture throughout the province, the bank has successively established 200 agricultural storage warehouses, and also cooperates with more than 2,100 agricultural cooperative societies to engage in cooperation, handle rural loans, and handle transportation and sales on behalf of others. Starting this year, the bank has decided to increase the number of agricultural warehouses from 200 to 300, so that the work of relieving rural areas can be widespread. According to the bank, the work of relieving rural areas already includes the following: 1. Acting as an agent for the packaging, transportation, and sales of agricultural products; 2.

<h3>Japanese Residents in Shanghai Issue Banknotes, Japanese Consulate-General Rejects and Disapproves, Believing that the Organization is Illegal and Impairs the Financial System of Other Countries</h3>
<p>Shenshi News Agency reports that Japanese residents in this city plan to form a silver group to issue a type of Japanese banknote in order to dump Japanese goods and avoid exchange losses. Preparations have been underway for some time. They have repeatedly submitted requests to the Japanese Consulate-General in Shanghai, requesting approval for filing. The request has not been approved. The Japanese residents believe that the issuance of Japanese banknotes is of great benefit to the Japanese residents themselves. They will not stop until they achieve their goal. Therefore, they have strongly argued with the Japanese Consul-General, requesting approval for filing and protection of issuance. Until recently, the Japanese Consulate-General formally rejected and disapproved the request. The reason given is that the organization is illegal, and the credit and custody items lack significant and reliable guarantees. Not only is it not beneficial to the Japanese financial system, but it also impairs the financial system of other countries. Therefore, the request for permission to issue banknotes should be rejected. After the Japanese residents received the order from the Japanese Consulate, they abandoned the idea of issuing Japanese banknotes, believing that there was no hope for the matter.</p>
<h3>Telephone Issue Meeting: Support Chinese Directors; Negotiation with the Two Settlements' Authorities Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Special District Telephone Issue Committee, in order to oppose the disguised price increase of telephone services, has decided to negotiate with the British and French Concession authorities tomorrow and to write to the Ratepayers' Association to support the Chinese directors' proposals. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Negotiation with the Two Settlements Tomorrow</p>
<p>According to the resolution of the third joint meeting of various groups in the Special District Telephone Issue Committee, it is decided that at 1 p.m. tomorrow, Qu Zhenhua and six others will be sent to gather at the meeting place first, and then negotiate with the Public Concession’s工部局 and the French Concession’s公董局 separately. The petition reads: "To the Honorable Authorities: As the market declines and business is depressed, the Shanghai Telephone Company, disregarding the situation in this city, resolutely put forward a method of charging by calls. Since the promulgation of the new regulations, users throughout the city have been alarmed. We find that your authorities are the highest supervisory bodies in the concessions and should stop the Telephone Company's improper and reckless actions. The joint meeting of various groups on February 20 resolved to send Qu Zhenhua, Mao Yun, Li _kui, Zhang Yichen, Gong Jinggu, Ke Ganchen, Gu Wensheng, and seven other representatives of all users in the city to present the whole situation in person. We respectfully request your authorities to grant us an audience."</p>
<p>Support the Chinese Directors' Compromise Proposal</p>
<p>At the same time, the committee sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, supporting the Chinese directors' compromise proposal on telephone prices. The original text reads: "To the Honorable Association: We have read the report on the telephone issue published by your association on February 22, which shows your association's and the Chinese directors' efforts to negotiate on this issue. The Shanghai Telephone Company only seeks its own interests and disregards the public interest, resulting in no satisfactory outcome. However, the Chinese directors are representatives elected by your association's general assembly, so the words and deeds of the Chinese directors should be absolutely supported by all Chinese ratepayers in order to achieve thorough implementation and prevent the loss of the Chinese directors' prestige and to increase the power of the Chinese directors' subsequent words and deeds. Now the Chinese directors have proposed four articles, to modify the telephone experts' proposed call-based tariff schedule (i.e., the business telephone fee is ten silver dollars per month for 150 calls, and the home telephone fee is six silver dollars and fifty cents per month for 100 calls) as follows: The business telephone fee is ten silver dollars per month for 200 calls, and the home telephone fee is six silver dollars and fifty cents per month for 150 calls. The revised tariff schedule will be implemented from April 1, 1936 (i.e., the 25th year of the Republic of China), and will then be replaced by the current temporary 11% price increase after one year of implementation (the temporary price increase has been implemented since April 1, 1935). After adopting the above revised tariff schedule, the authorities should immediately request the company to modify the tariff schedule whenever the company's net profit exceeds the permitted 10%, so that the telephone fee can be immediately reduced. If the company's net profit is less than 10% after the above revised tariff schedule is implemented, the company may not request a price increase again within five years from the date of implementation of the tariff schedule. The authorities should request the company to make substantial savings in operating and maintenance costs. However, the chairman of the工部局 negotiated with the Telephone Company and rejected all but the first point of the third article and the fourth article. This shows that the company not only despises the opinions of the Chinese directors but also puts the entire工部局 in an absolutely difficult position. The company's desire to be rich and uncharitable is evident. Our association is satisfied with the resolution of your association on February 22, but please let us know the means of supporting the Chinese directors' proposals so that we can prepare and act as a backing. In short, the Chinese directors' proposals are being disregarded by the Telephone Company, which should not be let go lightly. Your association should consider this further. We hereby write to you for your information."</p>
<p>Letter to the Postal Bureau: Establish Messenger Vehicles</p>
<p>Various groups held a joint meeting on the 20th of this month and resolved to write to the Postal Bureau, requesting the addition of messenger vehicles to remedy the removal of telephones. The letter reads: "To the Honorable Authorities: The Shanghai Telephone Company, in order to satisfy its desire for a small amount of official interest, has formulated a new tariff schedule, which will be implemented from March 1. In this situation of economic depression and difficult maintenance, how can the citizens bear an additional burden? Various groups in the city have repeatedly appealed, requesting the cancellation of this measure, but have not been granted approval. In order to prepare for a vigorous protest, representatives have been sent to the工部局、公董局、Ratepayers' Association, and other agencies to make serious representations and request the upholding of justice. According to the Federation of Citizens of the First Special District, the branch associations have jointly suggested that, as the price increase of telephones in the Special District is approaching, users are willing to sacrifice everything and allow them to be removed before a satisfactory solution is reached. However, in order to facilitate the city's commerce and rapid transmission, the Postal Bureau should order all postal districts to organize messenger vehicles and print messenger cards, charging one cent for all routes (or according to the normal postal card value), and assigning special personnel for particularly rapid delivery. Our association believes that this suggestion is indeed a good policy for relief, and we hereby write to your bureau, requesting that you promptly formulate a plan and announce its implementation for the convenience of the public. Respectfully to the Shanghai Postal Administration."</p>

<h3>Fuxin Cigarette Factory: More Than a Thousand Workers Go on Strike, Workers Resume Work After Party Department's Persuasion, Factory Suspends Raw Material Distribution, Leading to Another Strike</h3>
<p>The Ta Kung News reports that the Fuxin Cigarette Factory on Macao Road in West Shanghai, founded solely by Ding Houqing, is large in scale and employs more than a thousand male and female workers. The factory's business has been developing well. The factory's workers have been paid only three or four yuan a month because the factory has changed the wage calculation to hourly wages, and the piecework wages are also lower than those of other factories, resulting in difficult living conditions for the workers. They have repeatedly requested the factory to improve their treatment, but the factory has not agreed. Recently, they submitted a formal request to the 3rd District Cigarette Industry Workers' Union to the factory, but the factory has not responded, causing resentment among all the workers. At around 10 a.m. yesterday, they announced a strike to urge the factory to realize its mistake. The Putuo Road Police Station in charge of the area reported the incident and sent a large number of policemen to the factory to suppress it. Because the workers were in good order, they did not interfere. Upon hearing the news, the 3rd District Cigarette Workers' Union sent personnel to persuade them to return to work, but to no avail. They reported to the Municipal Party Department, and Lu Yinchu of the Civil Affairs Section rushed to investigate the truth and persuade the workers to resume work first, and then schedule a mediation on the conditions. The workers were satisfied and immediately resumed work. However, the factory suddenly announced at 2:30 p.m. that it would suspend the distribution of raw materials, so the workers had no work to do, and they fell back into a state of strike. It is reported that the situation is serious, and the labor unrest may expand.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Native Place Associations from Northern Jiangsu Hold Relief for Rickshaw Pullers, Registration Is Enthusiastic, More Than Three Thousand Rickshaw Pullers Registered Within Three Days, Rickshaw Industry Association Issues Notice to Assist</h3>
<p>The Shanghai native place associations from Northern Jiangsu have organized a joint office to provide relief for unemployed rickshaw pullers in this city. Registration began only three days ago, and the number of registered people has reached more than three thousand four hundred. It is also learned that the Rickshaw Industry Association of this city believes that this move is closely related to rickshaw merchants, so it has issued a notice to all rickshaw merchants to provide as much assistance as possible. The following is an exploration of various situations:</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Registration</p>
<p>Various native place associations in Northern Jiangsu have organized a joint office specifically to provide relief for unemployed rickshaw pullers, most of whom are fellow villagers, to register, so as to count the number of people and ask the authorities to provide appropriate relief on their behalf, so as to maintain their livelihoods. Since it started on the 22nd of this month, it has been three days. According to statistics from the office yesterday, the number of unemployed rickshaw pullers who have registered is as follows: 374 in the Central District, 1,621 in the Southern District, and 1,415 in the Northern District, totaling more than 3,400 people. The number was the lowest on the first day and the highest on the third day, accounting for a quarter of the total number. It is expected that the number of registrants will increase even more after today, because in the past three days, the rickshaw pullers have not yet fully understood the situation.</p>
<p>Association Assistance</p>
<p>The Special District Office of the Rickshaw Industry Association of this city issued a notice to all rickshaw merchants yesterday, saying, "For the notice, we have received a letter from the Joint Office of the Native Place Associations in Northern Jiangsu (the original letter has been published in the newspaper and is omitted) and so on. It is hereby approved. Each rickshaw owner often has an insufficient number of licensed rickshaw pullers to allocate for driving, resulting in vehicles being parked and blocking the streets, which is visible everywhere. It is indeed necessary to issue additional licenses and increase the number of rickshaw pullers. Our office representatives have been negotiating with the authorities for more than a day. Now the Native Place Associations in Northern Jiangsu are organizing the registration and relief of unemployed rickshaw pullers, which is also a subsidy for our rickshaw industry. All of our special district rickshaw owners are urged to inform the contractors and those who are planning to pull rickshaws but have no vehicles to go to the registration location for registration. This matter concerns the livelihoods of rickshaw pullers and the business of rickshaw owners. Do not turn a deaf ear and辜負the good intentions."</p>

The team leaders are enthusiastic patriots, support the aviation national salvation movement, work hard on microsolicitation, and have achieved excellent results, which is admirable. The proceeds that have been raised have all been submitted. The receipts that have not been submitted will be urged to be completed by the 48 teams. The other teams have either submitted part of the results or are still in progress. It is hoped that the secretaries will assist them in the actual situation so that they can be completed as soon as possible. Although the collection of aviation national salvation funds in restaurants and hotels has not yet been completed for a month, the results are excellent because the people are voluntarily donating, the gentlemen of the industry are working hard to promote it, and people from all walks of life are enthusiastically supporting it, which is admirable. The collection of aviation national salvation funds in the boiled water industry was previously suggested by the industry association, and personnel were sent to contact and discuss it separately. It was decided to start collecting on March 1. The method has been approved by the Municipal Government, and the announcement will be sent to the office in the coming days. The collection of aviation national salvation funds in the hotel, brick, and gravel industries will be handled as usual, and the results are very good. In addition, after each external affairs secretary reported on the contact and investigation situation, the discussion of the micro solicitation fundraising plan was raised, and the meeting adjourned at 4:30. It is also reported that in order to make the citizens of the city understand aviation construction and generate interest, the general team office has held aviation national salvation mobile exhibitions in the city center, South Shanghai, West Shanghai, and North Shanghai. The attendance was enthusiastic, and the details have been repeatedly reported in the newspapers. Starting on the 22nd, the exhibition will continue to be held in the billiard room of the Great World on Edward Road for a period of one month. In addition to the original models of airplanes from various countries, models of various types of aircraft, photos, publications, and publications from the Navy Aircraft Manufacturing Office, there are also dozens of recent aviation money from various countries and various aircraft and airship charts with detailed explanations. The content is extremely rich. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will actively visit.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Explains - No Stamp Duty for Workers' Booklets - But Stamp Duty Still Required for Work Accounts</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce issued a letter to the Hexing Knitting Factory yesterday to explain the stamp duty doubts. Regarding the matter of affixing stamp duty, we are writing in reply to your letter of the 22nd of this month. The details have been noted. The replies are as follows: The booklets issued by your factory to the workers for them to collect wages after a certain period of time are called "work account booklets" in Article 16, Section 4 of the Stamp Duty Law. In order to reduce the burden on workers, it is stipulated in the tax-free column of this section that no stamp duty should be affixed. The account books used by the factory itself to record the wages paid to the workers are the "books used by business establishments" in Article 16, Section 10 of the Stamp Duty Law. Each book should be affixed with two cents of stamp duty each year, which is the same as the account books used by other business establishments, and is not within the scope of stamp duty exemption.</p>
<h3>Postal Service - Expansion of Simple Life Insurance Business - Post Offices in Seven Districts to Open on March 1st - Large-Scale Publicity Has Been Expanded in This City Since the 10th</h3>
<p>Since its opening, the simple life insurance business operated by the postal service has shown a vigorous momentum. For the sake of economic security for the people in various places, the Ministry of Communications will first have the seven districts of Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Anhui, Hunan, and Hubei concurrently operate simple life insurance from March 1st, and then gradually extend it to the whole country. The postal service in these seven districts will send personnel to the Insurance Department of the Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau to first practice various handling procedures at the department. It is heard that representatives from the seven districts have arrived in Shanghai one after another a few days ago, and a meeting was held in the conference room of the Supervisory Committee of the Bureau in the afternoon. The number of attendees included Zhang Mingxi, the director of the Insurance Department of the Bureau, as well as the section chiefs, consultants, and medical officers, as well as Zhang Zuqu (Shanghai), Ju Wenyuan (Jiangsu), Sang Yuanqing (Zhejiang), Zhang Chengbang (Anhui), Guo Bingkun (Jiangxi), Li Shifen (Hubei), and Hong Junge (Hunan). First, Director Zhang lectured on the consciousness of insurance and the procedures that should be paid attention to. It was decided that Consultant Li and Medical Officer Dong, Section Chief Shen, etc. should give speeches successively, and then visit the various section handling procedures and important charts. After the practice was completed in about three or four days, Director Shen and Deputy Director Zhou gave instructions. Now, the personnel from various districts who have come to Shanghai for practice have set off one after another to start preparations in various places. It is also heard that the Bureau's local business has been conducting large-scale and widespread publicity since the 10th of this month to thoroughly understand the meaning and benefits of simple life insurance for the general public. The publicity plan will divide the postal area into several parts. First, the Postal Administration will hand over the publicity materials to the mail carriers to distribute them door-to-door, and then send all the receptionists to persuade them. It is said that this work will be started by District One of the Post Office (that is, the delivery postal area under the jurisdiction of the Sichuan Road General Post Office), and then extended to other postal areas. It is expected that after the mobilization order is issued, there will be great achievements.</p>
<h3>Last Year's General Traffic Situation in the Public Concession - The Total Number of Vehicles of Various Types Has Increased Compared to the Previous Year - The Number of Deaths and Injuries in Accidents Has Decreased Significantly Compared to the Previous Year - The Increase in the Number of Bicycles Seriously Hinders Traffic</h3>
<p>According to the year-end report of the Public Concession Police Department, regarding traffic matters, the number of vehicles of various types in 1935 was higher than that of the previous year, and what can be called satisfactory is that the number of accidents and loss of life was the lowest in recent years. The number of traffic accidents in the past five years is listed below.</p>
<p>Among the 9,632 accidents last year, 827 cases were divided into damage to property and injuries to people, including 25 deaths, 5,862 cases were damage to property only, and 2,943 cases were injuries to people only, including 60 deaths.</p>
<p>The situation of public vehicles in the concession this year is very good due to the special attention of the police authorities. Motorcycle patrols to stop dangerous driving and other violations of regulations, and to assist in smooth traffic flow during peak hours, are still very effective. The increase in parking restrictions on Nanjing Road and Jing'an Temple Road, and the reduction of tram stops, are also very beneficial to traffic during busy hours. The number of reported cases of violations of traffic regulations was 27,042, which is a significant decrease compared to the more than 48,900 cases in the previous year. A total of 9,435 cases were filed for prosecution, which is an unprecedented record. Minor offenses have been given written or temporary verbal warnings separately. However, the majority of offenders still fail to fully understand the issue of bail with the police, because this guarantee deposit is stipulated by the Chinese court and is originally for the freedom of movement after the violation, which is different from a fine. However, if the offender is unwilling to appear in court afterwards, the guarantee deposit will be confiscated immediately. Among the 8,648 prosecuted cases this year, a total of 2,997 people gave a guarantee deposit and abandoned their appearance in court. Regarding the crackdown on car horns, Article 30 of the traffic regulations related to this has been slightly revised in each quarter of this year. After the serious crackdown by the Police Standing Bureau, the situation has improved significantly. A total of 1,709 drivers were prosecuted and fined this year. A total of 111 drivers who repeatedly committed offenses and refused to repent had their licenses suspended. A total of 335 driver's licenses were issued to car owners and 1,664 driver's licenses were issued to drivers this year. A total of 23 driver's licenses were revoked and 220 were detained. There are currently 19,318 registered drivers, which is more than 1,700 more than last year. In addition, a total of 1,762 truck licenses were issued this year, slightly less than last year. 6 unsuitable trucks had their licenses detained due to poor machinery, 185 licenses were detained. There are currently 30 charcoal-powered vehicles in the concession. All of them have been strictly inspected before issuing licenses to prevent danger. Solid tire vehicles are gradually decreasing. A total of 83 truck accidents were investigated, of which only 23 were due to poor machinery. A total of 1,358 people were prosecuted for overloading. The total number of car lines at the end of this year was 31, which is 8 fewer than last year. Rental cars have been reduced from 520 to 500. A total of 42 car services have been detained for poor machinery and dirty interiors. The number of horse-drawn carriage lines has decreased further this year. There were only 22 this year, with 74 public horse-drawn carriages and 39 private horse-drawn carriages. The average number of chartered cars for private use each quarter was 11,282, which is more than 1,400 less than last year. The crackdown on "wild chicken" chartered cars continues, and a total of 87 notices have been revoked. A total of 16,6595 chartered car drivers have donated licenses, an increase of more than 3,200 compared to last year. The number of public rickshaws is still 9,990. A total of 2,091 licenses have been revoked for poor equipment and violations of regulations. 1,410 rickshaws were too dilapidated to be used again. A total of 1,041 new-style rickshaws have donated licenses. A total of 19,307 rickshaw drivers were detained for violations this year, a decrease of more than 4,000 compared to last year. The total number of rickshaw drivers registered at the end of the year was 41,130. The number of bicycles has increased again by more than 2,800. The total number at the end of the year was 35,743. It can be said that this type of vehicle is the most serious problem besides rickshaws, and it is also very easy to cause accidents. Among the traffic accidents this year, there were no less than 2,300 cases involving bicycles. In addition, the total number of dump trucks and "tiger" trucks was 19,926, a decrease of 300 compared to last year. The total number of small carts was 6,531, a decrease of 1,200 compared to last year. Furthermore, the total number of motor vehicles of various types this year was 10,292.</p>

At the same time, they will host a banquet for the press to give full publicity to the cause of domestic goods and promote domestic goods production.

<h3>A Japanese Killed a Chinese</h3>
<p>Mitsubishi Yoko, in Jiujiang Road, recently plans to expand, so it is adding a new house. The project is contracted by Yu Hongji Construction Factory in this city. However, the foreign company has separately dispatched six Japanese to supervise the work on the site every day. At about 9:00 AM yesterday, three plasterers from Yu Hongji, named Ma Atao, from Pudong, 43 years old, etc., were working in the work area. For some unknown reason, they suddenly had a dispute with the Japanese supervisor. At that time, the Japanese immediately started fighting. At that time, the two plasterers saw that they were about to be humiliated and tried to escape, but Ma Atao was grabbed because he was a little slow to move. He was locked in an empty room and beaten severely by the Japanese with the force of six people, causing Atao to be injured, his abdomen being injured, and his breath fading. The Japanese then let go. Fortunately, the police had learned of the matter and immediately dispatched Bao Tan No. 260 to investigate, and sent Atao to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, due to the severity of the injury, he died at 3:30 PM yesterday. The body has been sent to the coroner's office, waiting to be reported to the court for examination this morning.</p>
<h3>A Japanese Corpse Was Found on the Huangpu River - With Severe Head Injuries - Possibly Due to a Fatal Fall</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese Shanghai Daily, at 0:30 PM on the 23rd, a corpse of a man in a suit was suddenly found on the Huangpu River near the Pudong Post Office Pier. After the Customs Water Patrol Team checked the whole body, there were no injuries, and it was determined to be Japanese. Then, the Japanese Consulate General sent personnel to examine the corpse. As a result, the face had rotted and could not be identified. It was only known that he had been dead for a week and was about 30 years old, probably looking like a Japanese sailor. In the wallet in his pocket, there were two one-yuan banknotes from the China Development Bank, two jiao tickets from the China Farmers Bank, one jiao ticket, and one jiao ticket from the Zhejiang Local Bank, totaling two yuan and four jiao, as well as a promotional lighter from the Japanese Da Coffee Shop. The hygiene shirt and pants had the Tokyo Matsuzakaya trademark, and the tie was from the Wing On Company trademark. As of 2:00 PM yesterday, the 24th, Dr. Yoshida of Fumin Hospital examined the corpse again at the Morgue of the Public Works Department on Feren Road. There were hematomas in the center of the forehead and the back of the head, a one-inch crack on the corner of the eye, the skull was broken, blood was flowing from both ears, and there were signs of bleeding in the neck. It is still difficult to determine whether it was suicide or murder.</p>
<p>According to the investigation by this newspaper reporter, the corpse of the Japanese was examined at the Morgue at 2:30 PM yesterday. At that time, the Japanese Consul, the Chief of the Japanese West Patrol of the Hongkou Public Concession, and senior police officers from the Water Patrol Police Station were all present to supervise. Shen Linfu, the boatman of the Pujiang Lifesaving Boat who first discovered the corpse, was also summoned. According to Shen, the corpse was found on the beach of the Pujiang River opposite the MBK Pier. The examination result showed that the corpse had severe head injuries that caused death. According to the observations of the injuries, it may have been caused by a fall on a hard object. At present, the police are still investigating and researching.</p>
<h3>A Violent Mobster Opened Fire and Killed Someone After Failing to Extort High-Interest Loans - Zhao Fumei Died Tragically</h3>
<p>Zhao Fuhai from Yancheng, 41 years old, lived at 584 Chedaijiao, Haifang Road. He made a living by lending money at high interest rates. The poor people nearby flocked to him. At about 6:00 PM yesterday, Zhao was sitting at home when two men suddenly came and wanted to borrow money from Zhao. At that time, Zhao decided to refuse because he did not know them and their appearance was bad. Unexpectedly, the men stayed for a long time and did not leave, and spoke harshly, so a conflict occurred with Zhao. It is known that one of the men immediately took out a pistol and fired a shot at Zhao, hitting Zhao's head. He immediately fell to the ground, with blood and brains splattering all over the ground. The murderer saw that his purpose had been achieved and immediately escaped without a trace. When Zhao's family called the police, Zhao was dying. He was rushed to the hospital for treatment, but he died on the way due to his serious injuries. The body was transferred to the coroner's office, and the police were reported to send detectives to pursue the murderer.</p>
<h3>An Unfilial Son Sent a Letter Threatening His Stepfather - Chen Weizhong Was Greatly Frightened Upon Receiving the Letter - Both Letters Were Submitted to the Court</h3>
<p>Chen Sheng (i.e., Xu Sheng), a woman from Changzhou who lived at No. 9 Jicheng Lane, Qingyun Road, Zhabei, was suddenly hacked to death by her son, Xu Maokun, with a knife at around 10:00 AM on the 18th of this month. He even dared to set fire to burn the body, hoping to destroy the body and eliminate the traces. Fortunately, the fire did not cause a disaster. He also swept away all the clothes, coins, and banknotes of his mother and fled. After this rare tragedy of unfilial piety occurred, the society was quite shocked. The details have been recorded in the previous newspaper. Chen Weizhong, the second husband of Chen Sheng, sympathized with the tragic death and filed a lawsuit with the Procuratorate of the Local Court, requesting strict detention to avenge the injustice. In recent days, Chen Jizhong suddenly received two threatening letters delivered by mail, bearing the name of the unfilial son. The wording was roughly as follows: "I originally planned to hack your old livestock (referring to Chen Weizhong) to death, but I accidentally killed my mother because I was in a hurry. I did not take all of my mother's funeral clothes. You should pay attention. Sooner or later, I will make you the same way as my mother," and so on. After receiving the letter, Chen Weizhong observed that it was indeed written by the unfilial son, and could not help but be frightened. He had raised the unfilial son with his own blood and sweat for many years, and suffered this huge disaster, which was no different from raising a tiger to harm himself, which was very sad. So, yesterday, he submitted the two threatening letters to the court, requesting that the perpetrator be quickly arrested and brought to justice.</p>
<h3>Counterfeit Liu Shen Wan - Lei Yunsheng Sues - The Criminal Part Has Already Been Convicted - Now Pursuing Losses of 10,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Lei Yunsheng Songfentang Herbal Medicine Store, located at No. 251 Minguo Road, French Concession, has been in business for more than 100 years and has always been prosperous. However, in the winter of last year, two locals, Jiang Zhifu and Li Shaoxian, were found hiding boxes of counterfeit Liu Shen Wan powder produced by Lei Yunsheng and selling them outside. When they passed the Baer Road area of the French Concession, they were spotted by a police detective. The police detective suspected that Jiang and others were suspicious and copied out the counterfeit goods and took them to the police station. Then, they went to Li's residence on Damajie, Jiumudi, Huajie, and copied out counterfeit trademarks, counterfeit goods, and accounting records. After being sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, the examination was true. Li Shaoxian was sentenced to two months in prison for the crime of counterfeiting trademarks, and Jiang Zhifu was fined 30 yuan for helping to counterfeit trademarks. The plaintiff attached a civil lawsuit and should file a lawsuit with the Civil Division of this court. Lei Xianzhu, the owner of Lei Yunsheng Songfentang, hired lawyer Zhu Yisheng to file a statement with the Civil Division of the Second Special Court, stating that the defendant's illegal infringement, in addition to the criminal part, has been resolved by the French Police Affairs Department. However, by counterfeiting trademarks with inferior pills and powders and defrauding users, it not only hinders business but also endangers society. For the plaintiff, not only is the business damaged, but also the reputation of many years is affected. According to Article 195 of the Civil Law, the defendant should be liable for compensation of a considerable amount, and the defendant should be ordered to jointly and severally compensate for the loss of 10,000 yuan in national currency. The court approved the statement, and Judge Tu Shenjie took the seat in the Sixth Court at 3:00 PM yesterday. First, the plaintiff's lawyer stated the above situation. The defendants also hired a lawyer to defend everything. Judge Tu ordered each to leave and reschedule the hearing.</p>
<h3>Kangti Road Raid: Counterfeit New Subsidiary Coin Operation Uncovered. First, a Transporter Was Apprehended in the International Settlement. The Location of the Counterfeiting Operation Was Discovered Through Intense Interrogation. The Mint Sent Personnel to Explain the Differences Between Genuine and Counterfeit Coins.</h3>
<p>New subsidiary coins were officially circulated on the tenth of this month by order of the Ministry of Finance to the Central Bank, and have been in circulation for half a month. Due to their convenience for the public, the exchange has been exceptionally enthusiastic, causing the mint to work overtime to produce them, yet there is still a sense that supply cannot meet demand. Currently, among the three types of nickel coins in circulation, the five-cent coin is relatively easy to find, while the ten-cent and twenty-cent coins are scarce. Furthermore, there are rumors in the market about counterfeit ten-cent and twenty-cent coins. These rumors are not without foundation. In order to prevent financial disruption and maintain</p>
<p>the credit of the new coins,</p>
<p>the financial authorities have issued a general order to military and police authorities in all provinces and cities to conduct strict investigations. If any counterfeiting or circulation of counterfeit coins is discovered, severe punishment should be imposed according to the law to deter evildoers. Yuan Xinzhong, a detective from the Public Concession's Putuo Road police station, and detective Zhang Kun, having learned that there were individuals circulating counterfeit subsidiary coins who were planning to transport them to a certain location, had to pass through the Xiaoshadu ferry on Robert Road in western Shanghai. Therefore, they rushed to the location at 9:00 AM the day before yesterday and waited. Shortly thereafter, a man from Zhejiang named Wei Haichen</p>
<p>arrived alone,</p>
<p>his appearance suspicious. He was intercepted and searched, and one hundred and twenty counterfeit ten-cent subsidiary coins were found on his person. He was taken back to the police station and rigorously interrogated. Wei admitted that he was transporting counterfeit coins manufactured by a private counterfeiting operation and confessed that the private counterfeiting operation was located at No. 6, Lane 455, Kangti Road in the French Concession. He had delivered two batches. The first batch was five ten-cent coins, and the second batch was only three coins. The current one hundred and twenty coins were divided into three packages, each containing forty coins, intended to be delivered to the riverbank at Xiaoshadu Road, where</p>
<p>someone would receive them.</p>
<p>The selling price of these forty counterfeit coins was one yuan. The private counterfeiting operation was said to operate at night. The head of the police immediately dispatched Yuan and Zhang, along with western detectives, to the French police station to request additional detectives. They secretly went to the private counterfeiting operation and arrested two men from Jiangbei, Zhang Yuxiang and Zhang Baoshan. Inside the operation, there was a furnace for melting lead, three lead ingots, a package of "shuikai ding" (likely a chemical compound), a piece of glass, a file, and two ladles, all of which were</p>
<p>necessary for manufacturing.</p>
<p>There was also a significant amount of plaster of Paris for making molds. In addition, ten counterfeit ten-cent coins were found in Zhang Baoshan's bed on the third floor. All were taken back to the police station. According to both Zhangs, the mastermind was named Liu San, who had already fled in advance. Liu himself was responsible for all manufacturing work, and Yuxiang was only employed to operate the furnace and cut lead. Baoshan also admitted to having used one coin to buy noodles in the French Concession. Yesterday morning, the police charged the three criminals with counterfeiting currency and circulating counterfeit currency, according to Articles 195, paragraph 1, and 196, paragraph 1, of the criminal law, and filed a public prosecution with the First Special District Court. The Central Mint dispatched Chen Zaixiong, an employee of the accounting department, to the case to provide consultation. Subsequently, Judge Liu Meigui ascended the bench, ordered the three criminals to be brought to court, and inquired about their years, places of origin, addresses, and occupations. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, then presented the details of the case and the charges. Chen Zaixiong then testified that the genuine and counterfeit subsidiary coins were</p>
<p>completely different.</p>
<p>He said that genuine twenty-cent subsidiary coins weigh six grams each, and ten-cent coins weigh four and a half grams. Counterfeit coins are lighter. The patterns on genuine coins are fine and clear, while those on counterfeit coins are blurry. When viewed under a microscope, counterfeit coins have tiny pinholes, while genuine coins do not. Genuine coins are attracted by magnets, while counterfeit coins are not. Genuine coins are extremely hard, while counterfeit coins can be damaged by biting them. In addition to the procedures described by Chen for testing the authenticity, there is an extremely simple method: if the portrait of Sun Yat-sen on the front of a genuine coin is examined closely in a well-lit area, the shadow of the portrait can be seen on the reverse side. Judge Liu then interrogated Wei and the two Zhangs one by one and ordered them to be returned to custody for further questioning at a later date.</p>
<h3>The Gang That Kidnapped Weng Xichun Was Taken To Court For Questioning Yesterday. The Victim, Weng Xichun, Testified About The Ordeal, Saying That The Kidnappers Stuffed His Ears With Cotton Wool And Plaster. The Five Male And Female Kidnappers Were All Detained Awaiting Further Questioning.</h3>
<p>Weng Xichun, a fifteen-year-old from Chaozhou who owns the Dehe pawnshop at 366 Qiwupu Road, was riding in a hired car with his sister to Donghai School on Liaoyang Road at around 8:00 AM on December 12th last year. About 100 yards from the school, he was ambushed by two men who jumped out of a pre-arranged Lili Company car, brandishing guns to silence him, and dragged him into the car. They kidnapped him and killed the chauffeur. Subsequently, they sent a letter demanding a ransom of 500,000 yuan. Reports were made to various police stations for investigation, but no</p>
<p>clues</p>
<p>could be found. More than two months have passed. Lu Liankui, the Chinese chief inspector of the Inspector-General's Office, learned that the hostage was being held in a thatched hut in Yujia Garden at 229 Xiangyin Road in the Chinese-controlled city center. He then cooperated with Chinese detectives Liu Shaokui and Wang Chengying, detective Xie Futang, and all Chinese and Western detectives to secretly go, armed with weapons, at 6:00 AM the day before yesterday. They cooperated with detectives from the Public Security Bureau, entered the premises quietly, and found Dong Xuezeng, a Yancheng native who was guarding the hostage,</p>
<p>sound asleep.</p>
<p>They were arrested, and a pistol containing four bullets was found nearby. They also apprehended three other people, including Zhang Sheng, the watchman, and Dong Da (also known as Jia Lou), the gardener, as well as his mother-in-law, Zhu Han, his wife, Dong Zhu, and his daughters, Daya Tou and Sanya Tou, and his son, Erya Tou, a total of eight men and women. They rescued the hostage and took him back to the Yulin Road police station for detention. Weng Xichun was taken home by his father, Weng Jinqing. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Public Works Department,</p>
<p>explained the previous events,</p>
<p>stating that the leaders of the case were the fugitive Pan Changgen and Wang Tang, and requested an extension for further investigation. Then, according to the victim, Weng, two bandits jumped out of the parked car at the time, took out pistols, dragged me into the car, sped through the city center, and hid me in the thatched hut in the garden. Initially, an unknown bandit slept with me. About twenty days ago, the defendants Dong Xuezeng and Zhang Sheng</p>
<p>took turns guarding me.</p>
<p>The defendant Dong Da often looked around outside the door, and his wife, Zhu, also came to peep from time to time. I haven't seen the others. The letters were written by the bandits and asked me to copy them, three or four in total. They said that they were living a hard life in the residence, and the ransom amount was not mentioned. Those people stuffed cotton wool in both my ears and put plaster on them, so I couldn't hear their conversations.</p>
<p>Dong Xuezeng, Zhang Sheng, and Dong Da's testimonies were evasive. Zhu Han and Dong Zhu said they didn't know. The Public Works Department lawyer, Zhang, requested that Dong Da's three children be sent to the Women and Children Relief Association for temporary custody. Judge Jiang Shuzi approved the request, and the five male and female suspects, including Dong Xuezeng, were detained for further investigation at a later date.</p>
<h3>The Gang That Kidnapped Qin Weiye Committed Multiple Major Murder Cases. They Murdered Wu Danggui And Robbed Zhou's Family in Kangjia Bridge.</h3>
<p>Wu Fugui (also known as Wu Er), a rickshaw puller from Yancheng who lived in a thatched hut at the eastern end of Tapu Road in Nanshi, was murdered by bandits on the night of the Lantern Festival. He was shot five times and died. Li Xiaobao, the captain of the detective squad of the Ximen Branch, and others arrested seven male and female bandits at the entrance of the Hengfeng Road Small Vegetable Market in Zhabei and seized three Mauser pistols. According to the confession of the bandit woman Zhou Wang (also known as Chen Wang), the Jing'an Temple Police Station of the Public Concession arrested three bandits, Li Yizhi (also known as Da Zhui), Wang Shaoqing (Ding Kezhen), and Xia San, on January 19 at Xiaoshadu Hede Road and other places for kidnapping Qin Weiye, a director of Tongyuan Bank, on Aiwenyi Road on January 15. They were the murderers of Wu Fugui. The Ximen Branch Detective Squad then escorted the bandit woman Zhou Wang to the Jing'an Temple Police Station for identification. Yesterday, Li Xiaobao, the captain of the Ximen Branch Detective Squad, led team leader Liu Changpei, detectives Chen Mingsheng, Jin Yushan, Liu Wenhui, and others, along with the bandit woman Zhou Wang, to the First Special District Court with official documents for prosecution. The court approved the transfer of the three bandits Li Yizhi, Wang Xiaoqing, and Xia San to the Ximen Branch for further investigation into the murder of Wu Danggui. Wang Shaoqing and others confessed without denial and also confessed that they robbed Zhou Qifeng's home (Zhou works at the Bank of China) at No. 38 Kangjia Bridge, Yanping Road, in the jurisdiction of the Caojiadu Branch, at 3:00 PM on December 25 of the previous year, stealing diamond rings, diamond bands, pearl flowers, gold bracelets, gold watches, fur coats, silver dollars, and other items. Subsequently, Li sent team leader Liu Changpei and detective Zhu Jinrong to escort the bandits Wang Shaoqing, Li Yizhi, and Xia San to Zhou Qifeng's home for identification and to redeem the original stolen gold watch and fur coat and other items at Kade Road and other places. Yesterday, Yao Guangnai, the director of the Ximen Branch, ordered the bureau staff to briefly interrogate them, prepared documents to send to the General Bureau for interrogation, and also heard that the First Special District Court had sentenced each bandit separately: Xia sentenced Wang Shaoqing to fifteen years, and Li Yizhi and Xia San were each sentenced to thirteen years.</p>
<h3>Mobil Oil Company Salesman Zhou Wenxiu Embezzlement Case: Zhou Suddenly Turned Himself In to the Company After Being Unsuccessfully Arrested for Embezzling More Than 20,000 Yuan.</h3>
<p>Zhou Wenxiu, also known as Zhou Yanqing, a 29-year-old from Suzhou, was a salesman at Mobil Oil Company with a monthly salary of 96 yuan. In the autumn of last year, Zhou obtained oil worth more than 3,700 yuan from the company, claiming that it was ordered by Yongda Rice Mill at No. 63 Huaxingfang, North Zhejiang Road. The company paid as requested and obtained a receipt from Yongda as proof. However, the payment was long overdue and had not been received. After the company sent personnel to investigate, it was found that there was no such mill. It then ordered various sales offices to investigate, and it was found that there was a Yongda Rice Mill in Changshu. They sent a letter to inquire, and the reply stated that they had not ordered oil from the company. At this time, Zhou suddenly sent a letter to Mobil Oil Company resigning from his position. The company then reported to the General Patrol Room and ordered detectives to go to Zhou's home at No. 33, Lane 275, Mintini Yin Road, but were unable to arrest him. It then petitioned the First Special District Court to issue an arrest warrant and offered a reward of 500 yuan in Mobil County for his arrest. On the morning of the day before yesterday, Zhou suddenly went to Mobil Oil Company to see the sales department manager, the American Mittell. He was sent to the General Patrol Room for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang filed a lawsuit for forgery and explained the defendant's embezzlement, stating that the defendant had embezzled 20,518 yuan and 2 jiao through the same behavior in the Hengchang Cotton Ginning Factory, Hongfang Pumping Station, Lisheng Rice Mill, Mingxing Cotton Ginning Factory, and Taichang Enamel Factory. Mittell then provided evidence to investigate the process. When questioned, Zhou replied, All the transactions I handled were real, but after I went to Hong Kong to seek employment and returned to Shanghai, I couldn't find them. Judge Feng Yede verified the confession and ordered a retrial at a later date.</p>
<h3>Examination Completed at China Merchants Steam Navigation Company; Company Affairs to be Sorted and Improved.</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's examination has been completed, and the examination committee is currently reviewing the papers to determine who will stay and who will leave. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Content of Examination Questions</p>
<p>The written test questions on Sunday consisted of three parts. The first part was a question-and-answer section using addition and subtraction. Under each question, one would add one "+" if it was "yes" and two "-" if it was "no," making it very easy to answer. The second question required each employee to describe their individual responsibilities within the company. The third question asked each person to express their opinions on the company's business development and improvements in order to contribute ideas. Because the exam questions were broad, everyone submitted their papers within one hour.</p>
<p>Distinguishing Excellence</p>
<p>All exam papers are currently being carefully reviewed by the chief examiners, such as Wei Yi, Lu Hanqin, Peng Hu, Hu Yili, etc., to distinguish between excellence and mediocrity. They will then be rated as A or B before being submitted to the three managers, Cai, Tan, and Lao. Then, based on the performance reports from the heads of each department, a standard for who will stay and who will leave can be determined.</p>
<p>Company Affairs Meeting</p>
<p>Today, the company held its second company affairs meeting, attended by the three managers, Cai, Tan, and Lao, and the heads and deputy heads of each department, to discuss the sorting out of various company affairs. According to the Executive Yuan's instructions, only 84 employees will be retained, so the number of employees to be laid off will be around 100. Once the results are evaluated, the fate of each person will be announced in about three days.</p>
<p>Treatment Guarantee</p>
<p>Before the examination, Cai Zengji accepted the five public proposals made by the employees. For those who fail the exam and are laid off, the company will issue a severance payment in addition to the year-end bonus, as well as a certificate of service. If the company needs to add personnel in the future, they will be given priority. Other qualified personnel who remain with the company will have improved treatment measures announced within three months and will have their future positions guaranteed. Their salaries should be increased, and the minimum should not be lower than the current amount. The guarantee rules will be promulgated by the ministry.</p>
<p>Branch Issues</p>
<p>After the reorganization of the head office, the branch system must be improved. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has 18 branches, divided into first, second, and third classes. For example, Hankou is a first-class branch because of the Yangtze River business. The Hankou branch's organization is also divided into departments, with a total of 70 to 80 employees. Now, according to the new establishment, the Hankou branch is limited to 15 people, so 50 to 60 people will have to be laid off. After the branch is reformed, they will start to reorganize the warehouses and docks.</p>
<p>Focus on Technology</p>
<p>It is said that the company will organize an engineering committee and hire shipbuilding experts. The engineering field will also be divided into mechanical experts, civil engineering experts, wireless experts, and wired experts. These technical personnel will be hired by the general and deputy managers and then commissioned by the ministry. They will be responsible for building ships, repairing ships, docks, telegraphs, and other items to ensure that everything is in accordance with economic principles.</p>

<h3>Shen Yanling's Divorced Concubine Sues to Meet Her Three Biological Sons. The Status of Mother and Son Exists, and Meeting is Permitted by Human Sentiment. The Court Instructs Both Plaintiff and Defendant to Report to the Court in Person for Questioning at the Next Hearing.</h3>
<p>Shen Yan, a 33-year-old from Wuxian who resides at 243 Gordon Road in western Shanghai and used to be a comprador for Sassoon, is known to be wealthy. Properties around Fengjili on Nanjing Road are all owned by him. Because his first wife never bore any children, Shen redeemed the famous prostitute Cheng Yuzhen and placed her in a separate residence. Cheng had the appearance of bearing sons and gave birth to three sons in a row. In 1931, Shen implemented a plan to abandon the mother and keep the sons, entrusting his wife and children to his first wife for upbringing, while giving Cheng a severance payment and signing a separation agreement. Afterwards, Cheng realized that sons were better than money and repeatedly sued Shen.</p>
<p>But She Was Always Defeated.</p>
<p>Now, she is 28 years old, and her three sons, the eldest of whom is 11 years old, are consulting with legal experts and learning that the mother-son relationship cannot be severed in law. Since her status as a mother still exists, she can see her sons. Therefore, she hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit against Shen Yanling in the First Special District Court, requesting that Shen be ordered to allow her three sons</p>
<p>to Meet Her.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Judge Peng Shi opened the court for trial. Shen has certain habits, so he did not report to the court. The plaintiff also claimed to be ill and did not attend, both being represented by lawyers. The defendant's lawyer then stated the circumstances of the plaintiff and defendant living together and successively producing three sons from 1923 to 1931, when they signed a separation agreement. Shortly thereafter, Cheng wanted to overturn the agreement and repeatedly sued Shen.</p>
<p>The Facts are the Same</p>
<p>And the object is the same. It seems that it should not be considered again. The defendant used to work for Sassoon and is now unemployed at home. The plaintiff's lawyer then rebutted, saying that the separation agreement signed in the past was a method by the defendant to beg her mother to keep her sons. The plaintiff was temporarily fooled, so she filed a lawsuit two months after signing the agreement. However, the previous lawsuits were all for requesting upbringing, not the current request for a meeting. It is not the same object of litigation, and according to the law, the mother-son relationship still exists, so the plaintiff's claim is very reasonable. The court then asked if the request for</p>
<p>a Meeting Between Mother and Son</p>
<p>Was only to see each other once, or to see each other often. If it was only to see each other once, then the defendant could be ordered to bring the three sons to the court to meet the plaintiff. The plaintiff's lawyer continued, The plaintiff's request is definitely not just to meet once. However, she does not intend to be with them all day long. The court then turned to the defendant's lawyer and said, The status of mother and son still exists according to the law, so it is</p>
<p>Reasonable Both in Law and Human Sentiment</p>
<p>To allow the mother to see her sons. The defendant should not obstruct it. It is permissible to arrange a time and place for the mother and sons to meet once every few days, which should not affect other matters. Therefore, there is no need to litigate this kind of dispute. However, since both parties are not present today, there is no way to persuade them to settle the dispute. The hearing is adjourned to 2:00 PM on March 10, and both plaintiff and defendant are ordered to report to the court in person for further questioning. After the ruling, the court adjourned.</p>

<h3>Inconsistent Exchange Rates for Fractional Currency Notes</h3>

However, the exchange rate of the new fractional currency is particularly high, which has led to recent fluctuations in the exchange rate of fractional currency notes. Each yuan can only be exchanged for 9 jiao 9 fen (99 cents), while each fractional currency of one jiao (10 fen) can only be exchanged for 290 wen. When people use it, they have to lose more than 100 wen per yuan. The Shanghai Cypress Industry Trade Association held a meeting of its members at 2 p.m. yesterday.

She had devoted all her energy to her daughter, hoping to find a good husband for her to rely on in her old age. She never expected Huiying to disobey her mother's wishes and secretly get engaged to someone. The mother resolutely opposed the marriage. Yesterday morning, in her capacity as guardian, she went to the Pudong Branch to file a complaint. The bureau accepted the case and summoned Tu and Huiying for questioning. First, Ms. Chen stated her case, saying that her private savings of three to four hundred yuan, which were stored with Huiying, had also been spent by the two of them privately. She was extremely indignant. Mr. Ye of the bureau said that the two defendants were well-educated and of similar age, and both worked in the education field. He strongly advised the plaintiff not to be so stubborn. However, Ms. Chen insisted that her private savings had been stolen and that she was worried about her old age. The two defendants said that they were willing to provide a living allowance of fifteen yuan per month and would also be responsible for the costs of the coffin and burial after the plaintiff's death, in order to fulfill their responsibilities as juniors. Ms. Chen still asked the bureau to be responsible for guaranteeing this. Mr. Ye then ordered the two defendants to sign a written statement of support and handed it over to Ms. Chen for safekeeping before resolving the matter peacefully.</p>
<h3>Tangjiawan, Accidental Fire at Mingming Battery Factory, Three Workers Injured</h3>
<p>At around 10:30 a.m. yesterday, a fire broke out accidentally downstairs at the Mingming Battery Factory, No. 53 Qing'an Lane, Tangjiawan, Ximen, Nanshi. In an instant, the flames soared into the sky and were uncontrollable. Soon, the flames broke through the roof. Upon receiving the alarm, the fire brigades from various districts rushed to the scene with pumps and began to extinguish the fire. After about an hour, the fire was finally extinguished. In this incident, the factory's two-story building was completely destroyed, but the surrounding buildings were not affected. When the fire broke out, three workers from the factory jumped from a height to escape and were able to escape danger, but they were injured in the fall. After the police officers from the Ximen Branch, which had jurisdiction over the area, sent them to the hospital for treatment, they learned that the factory owner was out and had not returned. They took Wo Jianru, a bookkeeper from Yixing, to the bureau to investigate the cause of the fire. It is reported that the factory had a large amount of fire insurance.</p>
<h3>He Adulterously Occupied His Wife and Falsely Accused Her of Theft; Zhou Miaogen's Case Concludes After Interrogation</h3>
<p>Last October, Zhang Yuefang (i.e., Zhou Zhangshi), the wife of Zhou Miaogen, a farmer from Qujiaqiao, Caoging, Huxi, ran away from her husband without a trace. Later, Zhou Miaogen learned that his wife, Zhou Zhangshi, had been seduced into an affair by his cousin, Zhou Weisheng, who was a Baojia, and lived together as a concubine in Sijing, west of Xinzhuang. Zhou Miaogen reported the matter to the police and took Zhou Zhangshi back home. The next day, Zhou Zhangshi ran away again, taking some belongings with her. Zhou Weisheng then reported to the police station, falsely accusing Zhou Miaogen of theft. This aroused public anger. After Zhou Miaogen proved his innocence to the police station, he was finally released. Zhou Miaogen felt that Zhou Weisheng had not only adulterously occupied his wife but also falsely accused him of theft, which was intolerable. He filed a lawsuit with the Procuratorate of the Local Court, stating the facts and accusing him. The prosecutor, Zhao Chuanjia, ordered Zhou Weisheng and Zhang Yuefang to be summoned to the case for interrogation. After verifying the facts, he ordered them to be detained and prosecuted according to law. Yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m., Judge Lu Hongyi presided over the trial in the twelfth courtroom. First, the plaintiff, Zhou Miaogen, testified that he was 19 years old and made a living by farming, and stated the previous events. He questioned the detained Zhou Weisheng, who testified that he was 37 years old and ran a grocery store, denying that he had any adulterous relationship with Zhang Yuefang. Finally, Zhang Yuefang testified that she was 23 years old and had returned to her mother's home because her husband had beaten her, and that there was no adultery. The official said, "You confessed without reservation at the Procuratorate, which was recorded in writing. How can you deny it now?" Zhang Yuefang was speechless. At this point in the interrogation, Prosecutor Zhao came to the court to make a statement. The judge said that the case was clear and concluded the trial, awaiting sentencing. The two defendants were remanded in custody.</p>

The murderer, Jin Amei, also stabbed himself in a vital area in an attempt to commit suicide. He was sent to the hospital for treatment but died. The body was taken to the morgue of the Tongren Fuyuan Sub-Hall for an autopsy. Yesterday, the detective reported to the Second Special Branch of the Procuratorate. The Chief Prosecutor, accompanied by the forensic doctor and clerk, came to the morgue to conduct an inquest. First, the detective explained the previous events. Then, Jin Chenshi, the wife of the deceased, testified that she was 42 years old, a native of Jiangwan, and that the deceased, Jin Amei, was 41 years old, her husband. They had been living together at No. 7 Jidel Lane, Caojiabo. Last year, her husband and Fan Maodi, the deceased, jointly opened a dance hall (the original site of Lishu) through an introduction by Fan Maodi. Unexpectedly, at the end of the year, not only was there no profit, but there was a loss of more than 900 yuan. On January 6th, her husband received a letter from Fan Shoutang, the manager of the dance hall, stating that he still had to pay the amount of the loss. After her husband received the letter, he questioned the introducer, Fan Maodi, but he ignored him. Therefore, her husband was angry and committed this tragedy. Her husband left behind three sons and four daughters. She requested leniency. Then, the Prosecutor Wang ordered the forensic doctor to examine the deceased, Jin Amei, and confirmed that he had committed suicide. The body was handed over to his wife, Jin Chenshi, for burial.</p>

<h3>Western Youth League First Division Volleyball: Chinese Youth Loses to Haiqing; Mai Zheng's Skills Amazing, Chinese Youth's Luck Too Poor; In Another Match, Russian Army Wins Western Youth in Straight Sets</h3>
<p>Two Western Youth League First Division volleyball matches were played last night. In the first match, the Russian Army defeated Western Youth in straight sets. In the second match, Chinese Youth faced Haiqing. Despite having an absolute advantage, Chinese Youth was tragically defeated by Haiqing by a score of 2 to 1. Although Haiqing's players such as Mai and Zheng have outstanding skills, they have their own way of winning. However, after watching the competition, one cannot help but sigh at the poor luck of Chinese Youth. Last night, impressed by the fame of the two teams, no fewer than 200 spectators watched the match. The Western Youth League gym was almost full. The battle was also extremely intense. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Taking the Lead: Chinese Youth vs. Haiqing took the stage after the Russian vs. Western match. The strength of both teams was at the same level. When two tigers fight, one must be injured. As soon as the battle began, Haiqing took the first serve. Mai Bingyao scored two points in a row, and Zhou Dayun also tied the score with a serve. After three to three, Chinese Youth's Qiu and Xu attacked, taking an eight to three lead. In an instant, Haiqing surged back, tying the score at eight to eight, and then taking a one-point lead. After that, neither side made any progress, and the score was extremely close. Haiqing, with Zheng Yiquan's fierce spikes, took several points, creating a fourteen to eleven advantage. Under this extreme threat, Chinese Youth responded calmly. Qiu Guangxie waved his iron arm, and there was a revival. Fourteen to fourteen, and the score was tied again. With Zong Qi and Guangxie pressing and spiking, Chinese Youth won the first game with a score of sixteen to fourteen.</p>
<p>Evenly Matched: After Chinese Youth won the first game, their morale dropped.</p>
<p>After the start of the second game, Mai Bingyao scored the first point, and Li Feiyun repaid the favor. Each scored a point. After that, Haiqing was in high spirits, accumulating points. Mai Bingyao saved a dangerous ball on the ground, with brilliant performances, instantly giving Chinese Youth a great threat with a seven to one lead. When Xu Heng and Chen Zongqi used cannonball-style serves, they managed to save the situation to six to seven, a difference of one point. Haiqing's Zhang Renming got angry and spiked hard, adding three points in a row. After that, the momentum was like a broken bamboo, and Haiqing completed the task with a score of fifteen to nine. The two teams were evenly matched.</p>
<p>Chinese Youth Suffers a Miserable Defeat: The third game was the key to victory or defeat. Chinese Youth used Li Feiyun and Zhou Dayun's serves to take five points in one go. Wei Dingyi, Qiu Guangxie, and Xu Heng saved many dangerous balls. Zheng Yiquan's lightning-fast spikes were commendable, winning thunderous applause. After eight to one, Haiqing struggled to add one point. Chinese Youth's teamwork was skillful. In an instant, it was twelve to three. Zhang Renming carefully served, scoring four points in a row, catching up to twelve to seven. Before they knew it, the score on the scoreboard showed that Haiqing had surged to thirteen to ten. Haiqing requested a timeout. After a brief discussion, the referee, Mr. Borrat, announced a recording error and changed the score to twelve to eleven, with Chinese Youth still in the lead. Suffering this blow, Chinese Youth's spirit weakened. They struggled to finish the game. As a result, Haiqing won the third game with a score of fifteen to twelve. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>Haiqing Lineup: Mai Bingyao, Burton, Zheng Yiquan, Frodo, Zhang Renming, Yang Zhiqiang</p>
<p>Chinese Youth Lineup: Li Feiyun, Qiu Guangxie, Xu Heng, Chen Zongqi, Zhou Dayun, Wei Dingyi</p>

<h3>Central-Youth Basketball League: Hua Feng Wins the Commercial Second Division Championship; Four Wins in Four Games, Yesterday Defeating Xiang Tai 23-18; School Division Makeup Game: Qing Zhong Wins Tax College by One Point</h3>
<p>The Central-Youth Basketball League's tenth week of competition took place yesterday afternoon at the Central-Youth Basketball Hall. Originally scheduled for four games, due to numerous postponements in the school division, an impromptu fifth game between Tax College and Qing Zhong was arranged. The first game was between Ge Zhi and Yu Cai in the school division. Ge Zhi has been practicing diligently recently, with rapidly improving skills. After losing to Qing Zhong in their first match, they subsequently defeated both French and McLaren colleges. Yesterday's game against Yu Cai saw two evenly matched teams. After the start of the game, Ge Zhi immediately took the lead, with Feng Yaosen scoring under the basket to open the scoring, and Zhao Qiang adding the icing on the cake, with the score rapidly increasing. When Yu Cai's Xu Liqun tried to catch up, time was running out. At the end of the first half, Ge Zhi led 17-7. In the second half, Yu Cai harbored ambitions of redemption and launched a fierce counterattack, putting on a good performance. Although they beat Ge Zhi 20-17, they had lost too many points in the first half. As a result, Ge Zhi won 34-27. The second game was between Cui of the Commercial Group and Xiang Tai B. Since the beginning of the competition, both teams had experienced both victories and defeats. This game was no less than a battle to resolve who came in last. In the first half, Xiang Tai B had a strong momentum, with Zhong Jingqi repeatedly making significant contributions. Cui's Zhou Huaibang refused to be outdone and fought back. The score between the two sides was extremely close. At the half, Xiang Chun temporarily led by one point, 14-12. After changing sides and resuming the game, all the players of Cui were careful and unwilling to throw the ball easily. As a result, they won the second half 16-13 from a declining position. The total result was 28-27, and Cui narrowly defeated Xiang Tai B by half a point. The third game was between Tai He and Qi Yi of the Commercial Third Division. Tai He had won every game in the Commercial Third Division, already creating a situation of four consecutive victories. Its strength is self-evident. However, Qi Yi's basketball skills are also not bad. In the first half, both sides went all out. Tai He relied on the unity of the entire team and took the lead 21-14. In the second half, Qi Yi struggled fiercely, but Tai He's defense was like a copper wall and iron barrier, and Qi Yi had to succumb to Tai He 20-10. The total result was 41-31. In the future, the Commercial Third Division championship will not go beyond the Tai He and Qian Chang teams. The fourth game was between Hua Feng and Xiang Tai A in the Commercial Second Division. Hua Feng is the best among the teams, with strong strength. The game against Xiang Tai was the final hurdle, so the entire army gave their all. In the first half, Hua Feng took the lead by half a point, 7-6. In the second half, Hua Feng did not dare to be careless and finally won again 16-12. As a result, Hua Feng won the Commercial Second Division championship 23-18. The finale was a makeup game between Tax College and Qing Zhong in the school division. This battle was no less than a fight for the championship, so the battle was a hundred times more exciting. It was an unprecedented event since the beginning of basketball competitions in schools.</p>

<p>Educational News</p>
<h3>Guangdong Education Department: Overview of Promoting Public Education</h3>
<p>(Guangzhou Correspondent) In recent years, the Guangdong Provincial Authorities have implemented a three-year plan, and significant progress has been made in the political, economic, and educational aspects. Among them, the aspect of compulsory education is being actively promoted. According to Huang Linshu, the Director of the Education Department, who described in detail the Education Department's one year promotion of compulsory education, an abstract record is presented as follows.</p>
<p>Huang believes that the most important plan for China's education at present is the popularity of compulsory education. Therefore, since he became the Director of the Education Department, the first issue has been how to promote compulsory education in order to popularize it. Guangdong Province already had a compulsory education committee in the Republic of China Year 17, planning everything about the implementation of compulsory education. However, due to funding and various other factors, it was not possible to effectively promote it. According to past statistics, in Year 20, the total number of primary schools in the province was 18,969, with 1,098,965 students. After the implementation of the three-year plan, in Year 23, the number of primary schools increased to 12,754, with 1,169,406 students. Compared with Year 20, the number of schools actually increased by 3,785, and the number of students actually increased by 370,441. If calculated as a percentage, the increase rate of the number of schools is 19%, and the increase rate of the number of students is 13%. Although this increase rate is barely satisfactory, it is still far from the ideal of popularizing compulsory education. Therefore, in the early spring of Year 24, the overall situation was coordinated, and a meticulous plan was formulated to provide provincial subsidies to impoverished counties for running compulsory education. Counties that are known to be impoverished, such as Ganen, Maojiang, Lingshui, Anhui, Fangcheng, Lingshan, Xuwen, Lianshan, Yangshan, Ruyuan, Wengyuan, Fogang, Kaijian, Fengchuan, Xinfeng, Heping, Lianping, Fengshun, Nanao, and Baoan, etc., are selected as the first batch of twenty counties, each county subsidizes the establishment of two county-run ordinary primary schools (four-year system), one school runs two classes, using a multi-grade composite teaching system, and one school runs one class, using a single-grade composite teaching system. Those who run multi-grade schools are provided with one principal who also serves as a teacher, and two teachers; those who run single-grade schools are provided with one principal who also serves as a teacher. The monthly salary of the principal cum teacher is 35 yuan, and the monthly salary of the teacher is 30 yuan, all of which are paid by the provincial treasury. Only the start-up costs of each school (140 yuan for single-grade and 220 yuan for multi-grade) and the monthly office expenses (6.60 yuan for single-grade and 10 yuan for multi-grade) are to be raised by the counties themselves. For especially impoverished counties, the start-up costs are also subsidized by the provincial treasury. In Year 24, forty ordinary primary schools subsidized by the provincial treasury were established in the spring, with a subsidy of 32,000 yuan. The faculty is also selected by the Education Department from the Provincial Primary School Teacher Training Institute and graduates of various normal schools.</p>
<p>This kind of subsidy method has been implemented for several months and is quite suitable for local needs, and has achieved considerable results. Therefore, it was decided again in the summer of Year 24 to increase the subsidy funds to more than 120,000 yuan and expand the subsidy counties to forty counties. In addition to the twenty counties originally selected, Danxian, Yaxian, Wanning, Qiongdong, Linggao, Qinxian, Wuchuan, Suixi, Chixi, Gaoming, Deqing, Yunan, Renhua, Shixing, Longmen, Longchuan, Zijin, Pingyuan, Huilai, and Huaxian were added as the second batch of twenty counties. On the one hand, the previously subsidized primary schools will continue to operate, and the one-class schools will be converted into two-class schools to broaden the accommodation. On the other hand, in order to facilitate popularization, each county will be subsidized to open four short-term primary schools, implementing a one-year short-term compulsory education, so that children of school age who have not yet attended school, and older out-of-school children, will have the opportunity to enjoy education, in addition to the original forty ordinary primary schools, there are 160 short-term primary schools.</p>
<p>In the autumn of the Republic of China Year 25, the Ministry of Education strictly ordered all provinces to follow the newly promulgated implementation of compulsory education measures and implement them on schedule, and allocated central subsidies. Guangdong Province's compulsory education funds were 130,000 yuan, of which 12,000 yuan were given to the Guangzhou urban area, and the remaining 120,000 yuan (was distributed to 50 districts), (that is, in addition to the above-mentioned 20 counties such as Danxian, the remaining subsidies were added to Dingan, Chengmai, Huaxian, Feijiang, Dianbai, Xinyi, Luoding, Yangchun, Yufu, Xinxing, Sihui, Guangning, Enban, Heshan, Sanshui, Conghua, Yingde, Lianxian, Nanxiong, Lechang, Zengcheng, Boluo, Heyuan, Puning, Haifeng, Qiangfeng, Wuhua, Jiaoling, Raoping, and Dabu and other thirty counties.) a total of 250 short-term primary schools were subsidized. The subsidy method was roughly the same as before, and in Yingxian and other twenty counties, each county also needed to raise funds locally to run three short-term primary schools. In Dingan and other twenty counties, each county also needed to raise funds locally to run ten schools. As for Nanhai, Panyu, and other twenty-four counties, which are relatively wealthy, the provincial treasury does not need to subsidize them. Each county must raise funds locally to run fifteen schools. According to statistics, the province must open 1,130 short-term primary schools and 10 ordinary primary schools in Year 24. In addition to the subsidies from the provincial treasury and the central government, the counties themselves raised a total of more than 500,000 yuan. It is reported that Guangdong Province's compulsory education work has achieved such results in one year, which was something that the general public did not expect at first.</p>

<h3>Jiang Tingfu Gives a Lecture at National Central University</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th) Jiang Tingfu gave a lecture on the International Current Situation at National Central University's Memorial Week on the morning of the 24th, saying that the countries of the world can be divided into three categories: wealthy and strong, strong but not wealthy, and wealthy but not strong. He believes that the foreign policy of a wealthy but not strong country should be: 1. Support and maintain world peace; 2. Develop its own interests within the scope of not harming the interests of others; 3. The whole country should work hard to modernize the country's politics, society, and all aspects, so as to achieve self-reliance and self-improvement.</p>

<h3>New Life and National Revival: Radio Address on the Second Anniversary of the New Life Movement</h3>
<p>— Lei Zhen</p>
<p>Brothers, today I will talk to you about the relationship between the New Life and National Revival. During this period of extremely serious national crisis, our country's position in the international community is besieged on all sides. Our nation is like a leaky boat struggling in a stormy sea, with the danger of sinking at any time. In such a time of crisis, how should we strive to revive our nation and consolidate our country? Every national has a responsibility, and it is also everyone's aspiration. The important way to revive the nation, as shown to us by the Premier in Nationalism, is to restore national morality and invigorate the national spirit. If the national spirit is decadent and national morality is lost, even if there are strict political measures and material construction, with strict laws and many abuses, it will be of no avail. The revival of national morality and the invigoration of the national spirit cannot be achieved by political laws. It requires the awakening of the nation itself, and also the awakening of every member of the nation. Every national must feel the difficulties in the future of our nation and country, and everyone must strive to exert themselves, and then the national spirit can be invigorated. What is the way to self-strive and self-initiate? Practicing the New Life is the way to strive. Therefore, we say that practicing the New Life is the basis for invigorating the national spirit, restoring national morality, and also the basis for national revival. Speaking of the New Life, we have to add some explanation. The so-called life is the way people live with each other. The so-called new is not bought, borrowed, or brought from abroad, but is a kind of washing away of old habits and bad habits, and re-doing the meaning of a good person who stands upright. The so-called all kinds of things in the past are like death yesterday, and all kinds of things in the future are like life today. This is the determination to implement the New Life. Guan Zi said that propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame are the four dimensions of the country. If the four dimensions are not extended, the country will perish. This is the great path of survival and death that our ancient sages and wise men have indicated to us. Now we want to revive our nation and save our country, so we must start from the root and build up the nation's morality, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame. Everyone must strive to exert themselves and fight together. What is propriety? Propriety is the order of social life. The politics of our dynasties mostly used propriety to educate the people, so that the national life has a certain order. If the propriety is not clear, the social order will be in great chaos, and the country will also perish. Therefore, the Book of Songs says, "The rat has a body, but man has no propriety. Why not die quickly?" The Book of Rites says, "The parrot is taught by man, so that man has propriety, and knows that he is different from animals." It also says, "If a man has propriety, he will be safe; if he has no propriety, he will be in danger. If he is rich and knows how to be polite, he will not be arrogant or licentious; if he is poor and knows how to be polite, his aspirations will not be intimidated." Confucius explained propriety, saying, "What is propriety? It is the governance of things. The gentleman who has his business must have his governance. To govern the country and seek in the dark room, how can you see without a candle? If there is no propriety, then the hands and feet have nowhere to be placed, the ears and eyes have nothing to add, and there is no control over advancing and retreating. Therefore, to live with it, the elders and children lose their distinction, the boudoir family loses its harmony, the court officials lose their order, the field hunting and military affairs lose their plan, the military journey loses its image, the taste loses its time, the music loses its festival, the car loses its style, the ghosts and gods lose their enjoyment, the funeral loses its sorrow, the debate loses its party, the officials lose their form, and the political affairs lose their implementation. It is added to the body and wrong in the front, and all the actions of the multitude lose their appropriateness." From this, we can say that propriety is an essential element of political and social life. Now what we want to pay attention to is the propriety of obeying order, emphasizing responsibility, seeking neatness, emphasizing discipline, keeping promises, and loving the country. Secondly, let's talk about righteousness. What is righteousness? Righteousness is the right and wrong of human affairs, and it is the public reason of the human heart. Mencius said, "Righteousness is appropriateness." He also said, "The heart of right and wrong is the beginning of righteousness." So whether it is in accordance with righteousness or not is what should or should not be done. If it is something that should be done often, even if it is very difficult, it must be done. If it is something that should not be done, even if there is a knife on your neck or a gun in front of your chest, you cannot do it. Therefore, the ancients said, "Sacrifice life for righteousness." The loyal ministers and martyrs of the past all came from the word righteousness. In this dangerous time for our nation and country, our nationals must pay special attention to the cultivation of the word righteousness. This is indispensable in the revival of the nation and the salvation of the national crisis. The people who can truly die generously for righteousness are those who have cultivated in their daily lives. Let's talk about integrity again. In today's society, in the environment of economic panic and the great temptation of material enjoyment, the cultivation of integrity is the most difficult. The ancients said, "Do not be opportunistic in wealth, and do not be opportunistic in difficulty." The so-called "do not be opportunistic in wealth" is integrity. "Do not be opportunistic in difficulty" is righteousness. In this era, if we look at the people who can not be opportunistic in wealth and who can not be opportunistic in difficulty, there are very few, so the society is uneasy because of this. If we want to cultivate integrity, we must work hard on diligence and thrift. The ancients said, "Thrift is the way to cultivate integrity." If the material enjoyment is not extravagant, the virtue of integrity will naturally be cultivated. Then let's talk about shame. Let's not talk about national shame for the time being, let's first talk about personal problems. If a person does not know shame, he will do all kinds of evil and stop at nothing, selling his personality, selling his nation, and selling his country. Even if he is scolded by the world, he will not know shame. If there are many such nationals, it is more than enough to destroy the country and reduce the species. Therefore, the relationship between integrity and shame and the morality of the nation is so important. In summary, if we want to revive the nation, the most important task is to start from self-cultivation, to cultivate good virtues of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, to pay attention to daily life, and to work hard in all aspects of neatness, honesty, courage, diligence, thrift, obedience, and keeping promises. Everyone must practice reforming the bad habits of laziness, romance, arbitrariness, greed, and extravagance, and start anew. Only then can our nation be revived, and our country can be hopeful. The New Life Movement itself is an education, so we who are engaged in education work must first implement the New Life. (End)</p>

<h3>Overview of the Work in the Zhenjiang Rural Health Experimental Zone of Jiangsu Province (I)</h3>
<p>— Zhu Yunda</p>
<p>Establishment Process</p>
<p>In recent years, Jiangsu Province has spared no effort in planning and improving local health administration. Obvious examples include the reorganization of county health services, the increase in county hospitals, and the establishment of county health education instructors. The province is fully prepared and determined to promote rural health. However, policymakers often feel that the methods for implementing rural health administration facilities in China are still being created. The question remains: what kind of plan can be implemented to meet the needs of China's rural society? In August of last year, the Department of Civil Affairs established the Zhenjiang Rural Health Experimental Zone of Jiangsu Province, seeking to experiment and develop a health administration plan suitable for rural society in Jiangsu Province within a reasonable timeframe, to serve as a model for promoting rural health administration throughout the province. The draft regulations for the organization of the Jiangsu Provincial Health Experimental Zone, along with the preliminary budget and work plan outline, were approved by the provincial government. Yunda was appointed as the director of the Zhenjiang Rural Health Experimental Zone, and Mr. Hu Dingan was hired as the chief technical advisor. The office was established in Jianbi, the fourth district of Zhenjiang, and officially established on September 1.</p>
<p>The Situation in Jianbi</p>
<p>Initial facilities cover the townships of Jianbi, Yuehu, and Jiangshan. Future plans include gradually expanding to cover all rural areas of Dantu County.</p>
<p>Jianbi is 13 kilometers away from the provincial capital. It is adjacent to Dagang in the east and Dantu in the west. The Zhencheng Highway passes through this area, making transportation relatively convenient. There are a total of 1,338 households with a population of 5,763 people. Yuehu Township has 795 households with 3,001 people, and Jiangshan Township has 615 households with 2,337 people. The total population is 11,901, of which only 3,925 are literate. The low level of education among the people is evident. The atmosphere is closed and superstition is deeply rooted. There are no modern doctors in the town and surrounding areas. When people are sick, they seek help from gods and worship Buddha, believing in witches and ghosts. Many people die due to misdiagnosis. Most of the drinking water comes from river water, and very few households have wells. The river water is unclean, with people washing vegetables, rinsing rice, cleaning toilets, and pouring sewage all at the same time. This has become commonplace. The streets and ditches in Jianbi are even more appalling. The west, north, and south streets are very short, and the east street is slightly longer. Due to years of disrepair, they are all blocked. Residents have no way to drain the wastewater, and they pour it everywhere. Muddy water and ponds are everywhere. On rainy days, it turns into a swamp. Many farmers have pigsties in their homes, and manure pits in front of their doors. Houses have no windows, and it is pitch black inside. Ashes and stoves are together, which is extremely filthy. In this situation, the need for health facilities is great. However, the target population is complex, the accumulated habits are deep-rooted, and progress is particularly difficult.</p>
<p>The Purpose of the Experiment</p>
<p>I believe that the worse the target population and the more difficulties encountered, the more likely an extraordinary plan can be devised in an environment like Jianbi. Therefore, we are not afraid of difficulties. All staff members jointly decided on a purpose for the work experiment.</p>
<p>The purpose of the experiment is to teach people to "automatically" pay attention to hygiene, understand hygiene, improve their living environment, and improve their health. We absolutely do not teach people to be "passive." When they cannot be completely "automatic" at the beginning, at least we must have the ability to "promote" and encourage them to "automatically" accept health care methods and improve their sense of cleanliness. At the same time, we teach people to gradually transfer their superstitious spending to health care. Except for the administrative fees issued by the government on a monthly basis, we do not request operational funds from the government for all health facilities. Instead, we use the abilities and financial resources of the people in the rural areas to manage the health of the people in the rural areas. If our work can be completed on schedule after a year and a half, we will leave this place and move the office to other towns. At that time, the health services in Jianbi rural area will be handed over to the local people of Jianbi to manage, and Jianbi will be designated as a "health autonomous region." This is our ultimate goal.</p>
<p>The Method of Experimentation</p>
<p>The method of experimentation is divided into three forms: individual, family, and public. Each form grasps a central point as the driving force for promotion. Individual hygiene focuses on children, family hygiene focuses on women, and public hygiene focuses on adult men. If children can develop good hygiene habits during childhood, they can become healthy citizens in the future. In the real world, women are the backbone of the family. If hygiene knowledge can be fully instilled in their minds, and their sympathy and help can be obtained, they can set an example and improve the family. Then, the promotion of family hygiene will become easy. We have achieved considerable results in our four months of work. We are confident that focusing on promoting family hygiene through women is the right approach. Public hygiene focuses on adult men. Instilling public hygiene knowledge in adult men and increasing their awareness of public hygiene will reduce obstacles when managing public hygiene. Based on these three forms, we have grasped three central points and are striving towards our identified goals.</p>
<p>We aim to complete our mission in one year and six months. We have already completed four months of work.</p>
<h3>On the Construction of Chinese Mainstream Medicine (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>Scientific Modernization of Old Medicine, Sinicization of New Medicine</p>
<p>In my view, the construction of Chinese medicine must be based on China as the main body. For any medical construction undertaking based on China as the main body, two points must be recognized: first, the Sinicization of new medicine; second, the scientific modernization of old medicine. Please allow me to elaborate:</p>
<p>What is meant by the scientific modernization of old medicine? Old medicine has long been abandoned by the people. The main reason for its abandonment is that it does not conform to science. However, its history spans nearly thousands of years, and its books number in the tens of thousands. The minds and efforts of countless generations have been consumed in this field. Is there nothing to be gained from it? Even if it is not regarded as medicine for treating diseases, it should be regarded as a type of national heritage. The theories of Yin-Yang and the Five Elements are metaphysical, and the notions of "left liver, right stomach" are conjectures. These are all unscientific. However, the treatment with gold needles is suitable for the science of endocrinology, and symptomatic treatment corresponds to the foreign practice of homeopathy. I deeply feel that the academics of old medicine seem to require selection and organization. What does not conform to science should be discarded, and what is close to science or secretly corresponds to science should be made more scientific. To discard everything without selection seems excessive! As for domestic drugs, there are indeed many usable raw materials, which has already been proven by facts. The saying that "the Japanese extract nothing usable" is probably unfounded. If scientific methods can be used to chemically test each one, then many can be used, and not just for minor supplementation! Science is really the pursuit of truth. It is about using precise methods to seek correct truth. What I mean by the scientific modernization of old medicine is to remove its [unclear words, missing characters]</p>
<p>What is meant by the Sinicization of new medicine? New medicine is scientific medicine. Science has no national boundaries, so new medicine is universally owned and cannot be monopolized by one country. To say that new medicine should be Sinicized seems contradictory at first glance! But upon closer inspection, there is a profound truth in it! Each country has its own characteristics, just as each person has their own personality. In literature and art, it is best to express one's personality. In political measures, it is good to not obliterate the characteristics of one's own nation. The key to being oneself and not being assimilated by others lies entirely in this. New medicine has been imported into China for a hundred years! However, society calls it "Western medicine," and the government also calls it "Western medicine." Even the new medical community itself sometimes calls itself "Western medicine." Laozi said, "Names are guests of reality." Judging by the common name, it is evident that Chinese medicine cannot express its personality! The medical field is like this, so there is no possibility of independent medical practice. The government is like this, so medical administration and education are always subject to the constraints of neighboring countries. Therefore, to build new medicine in China based on China as the main body is an urgent task at hand? The way to build it can be divided into four points: First, the national mainstreaming of medical knowledge. On the Earth, there is East and West! There are water and land! There are frigid, tropical, and temperate zones! There are yellow and white races! Living under the same heaven and earth, and being people with heads and feet, the physique of people cannot but be slightly different due to differences in region, climate, and race, and the diseases they suffer cannot be completely the same. There are diseases that are universally common, and there are diseases that are unique to a region. There are even diseases that have different symptoms in Chinese and Western medicine. Don't you see the medical books of European and Western countries? The diseases they list are mostly based on those that are commonly seen in their countries. Those that are not are discriminated against and called exotic diseases (Maladies exotiques). Diseases commonly seen in China, such as malaria and dysentery, are called exotic diseases by them. Scholars in our country do not deeply investigate the reason, and they also echo the term "exotic diseases," as if they are residing in a foreign land. How ignorant they are of the relationship between host and guest! What is called "exotic" in their place is "mainstream" in ours. The standpoint is different, and the perspective is naturally different. Therefore, it is clear that European and Western medical books do not completely match all the diseases that exist in our country. However, the teaching materials used in medical schools in our country are either Western books in their original language or directly translated textbooks, and the professors mostly speak foreign languages. Students studying in schools have already forgotten the meaning of taking China as the main body. When they go out into the world, it is no wonder that they are crowned with the names of Japan, Germany, England, and the United States, and they argue with each other and flaunt themselves in the Chinese medical community. I believe that if we want to build a new Chinese medicine based on the Chinese mainstream, we must first engage in extensively collecting materials on Chinese diseases, record their symptoms using scientific methods, observe their problems, trace their causes, and study their treatments, in preparation for compiling a complete book of Chinese diseases. At the same time, the currently circulated translated texts should be re-examined, and Chinese diseases should be the mainstream and taught in Chinese. Other things, such as the language and writing of academic discussions, should also be in Chinese. In this way, the meaning of mainstreaming will be clear, and it will not lead to the reversal of host and guest! Not only that, but Chinese and Western people have different customs and environments, and their dietary habits often cannot but be different. Western people's recipes often do not fully suit the habits of Chinese people. This is true in ordinary times, let alone when one is sick? If people eat foods that they are not used to on a daily basis when they are sick, isn't that like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole? Therefore, a recipe that suits the habits of Chinese patients must be remade. In short, researching diseases, compiling books, and revising recipes are all necessary tasks for building new medicine in China. This is the first point.</p>
<h3>Scientific New Insights on Premature Infant Care</h3>
<p>— Qu Shaohang</p>
<p>The union of man and woman creates essence. Pregnancy naturally forms. The fetus lives in the mother's body, drawing on it for development. Tracing back from conception to maturity, it takes 40 weeks, which is 280 days. Therefore, it is usually counted as ten months. However, according to obstetrics, the delivery period is classified into four types: miscarriage, premature birth, term birth, and late birth. Any birth before 28 weeks of gestation is called a miscarriage. Any birth between 29 and 38 weeks is called a premature birth. Any birth between 39 and 40</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>weeks is called a term birth. Any birth after 40 weeks is called a late birth. The so-called premature infant refers to an infant born before the gestation period is complete and the fetus is not fully developed. In general, premature infants are physically underdeveloped. Their height and weight are smaller, and their internal organs are underdeveloped. Respiratory function, temperature regulation, etc., are very weak. Lactation and digestion are also incomplete. Therefore, the method of caring for them is especially difficult. In the past, the methods of caring for premature infants were limited to the three points described below:</p>
<p>First, preventing body temperature from dropping to compensate for insufficient temperature regulation.</p>
<p>Second, assisting the weakness of the respiratory center's excitatory force.</p>
<p>Third, paying close attention to feeding and striving to be patient and hardworking, increasing the amount of feeding to prevent insufficient nutrition.</p>
<p>Among them, there are various insulation devices for the first method of assisting temperature regulation, called warm tanks. Although the forms are quite different, the structures are roughly the same. The tank has double walls around it, with warm water injected in between. Using lamps and electricity, a separate adjustment device is attached to keep the air temperature inside the device constant between 26 and 28 degrees Celsius. Those without this equipment use methods such as wrapping the whole body with cotton or placing hot water bottles nearby.</p>
<p>Regarding the second method of encouraging respiratory function, in addition to the mechanical or thermal methods of skin stimulation and warm baths that have been used for a long time, there are also special drugs such as "Lobelin," "Vitacamphor," and "Coramin."</p>
<p>However, for the third nutritional problem, in addition to paying attention to nursing care during feeding, being patient and hardworking, promoting feeding power, and increasing the amount of feeding, there have been no reports of other drugs or treatments. Green premature infants usually have very weak sucking power, and some even have none at all. Therefore, those responsible for maintaining their nutrition must have sufficient patience. For example, give a small amount of breast milk frequently. Those who are unable to suck should have the milk sucked out with a syringe and injected directly into the mouth, or inject the milk into the stomach pouch through a gastric tube. Moreover, the physiological initial reduction in the weight of premature infants (partly due to the excretion of feces and urine, and partly due to the small intake of nutrients) is greater than that of mature infants. The time to restore the weight at birth is also slower. Therefore, scholars of the world are racking their brains to find a magic medicine that can prevent physiological weight loss, or at least restore the weight at birth earlier, so that the care of premature infants can be of some help. In recent years, hormone therapy has made daily progress, and almost all diseases can be treated with it. It can be used to make up for the deficiencies in the care of premature infants.</p>
<p>The above hormone therapy is roughly divided into two types: one is pancreatic hormone, that is, the combined use of insulin and glucose; the other is sex hormone therapy. The two are actually new therapies suitable for the care of premature infants. However, due to the limited space in this publication, the therapies cannot be fully described. For details, please read the eighth volume, sixth issue of the Clinical Medical Journal.</p>
<h3>Resurrection from the Dead (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Yue Qi</p>
<p>——Medical Story No. 18——</p>
<p>In a clean and quiet laboratory, three young men in white gowns stood around a surgical table. On the table, there lay a perfectly healthy hunting dog. One of the three put a mask on the dog's mouth. Another turned on the nitrogen tank, connecting a tube to the mask and injecting the gas into the dog's mouth. Before long, the dog stood stock still. Its muscles went limp. Clearly, the dog had been suffocated.</p>
<p>Thereupon, the three young men in white gowns immediately bustled about, gathering up hypodermic needles and small vials, tightly sealed with corks, containing a strange liquid. Four minutes passed. One of the three men glanced at his watch. Another, using a syringe, drew liquid from one of the vials and thrust the needle into the dead dog's chest, until the tip of the needle touched its heart. An oxygen mask was put on its mouth.</p>
<p>In response to the experimenters' efforts, the dead dog's nerves and muscles once again became tense. One of the three men put his stethoscope to the dog's chest, listened intently for a moment, and could not help but exclaim in surprise. The heart had begun to beat! The hunting dog, dead for four minutes, had come back to life. In a day or two it would eat. In a few weeks it would once again walk, run, play, and obey its master's commands.</p>
<p>The above is a description of how a young California scientist, Dr. Robert E. Cornish, recently conducted a "resurrection" experiment in his laboratory. Although the subject of the experiment died from suffocation, people who have died by similar means can also be resurrected with equal ease. In Baltimore, Cleveland, the Soviet Union, and Switzerland, other scientists engaged in different kinds of research are making similar predictions. They say that one day, what used to be an ancient miracle, "resurrection," will reappear in the world thanks to the blessings of science.</p>
<p>In the Soviet Union, someone used an artificial heart invented by Dr. Serge Brukhanenko to restore the life of a person who had died by hanging, although the time was very short. Three hours after the hanging, the doctor announced that he was indeed dead, and the body was sent to the laboratory. The doctor cut open an artery and a vein; at the laceration, tubes running from the artificial heart were inserted. An electric motor was turned on; the pump sent the black blood back into the venous tube. As the black blood passed through the artificial heart, the impure components were eliminated, and fresh oxygen was absorbed at the same time. Another pump injected this fresh blood into the arterial tube. Slowly, the body cells absorbed the life-giving oxygen, and the suicide victim finally opened his eyes, looked at the doctor by his side, but did not speak or move, like a simpleton. But after only two minutes, that spark of life was still extinguished.</p>
<p>Last January, in a public hospital in Baltimore, a female patient lay on the surgical table. A trainee suddenly shouted that the patient's pulse had completely stopped. The surgeon reached his hand into the opened incision and gripped the still heart with his fingers. He alternately squeezed and released the heart, allowing blood to circulate throughout her body. After a while, the heart finally began to beat on its own, and the woman was unexpectedly brought back to life.</p>
<p>In Geneva, Switzerland, a stubborn doctor repeatedly decided to experiment on people who had died by drowning or electric shock. The pulse was completely stopped, and all other signs of life were gone. He gently massaged the heart of the deceased. In most cases, after ten or fifteen minutes, the still heart began to beat again, and the dead were reborn. In other places, there are also many examples of using this method to resurrect the dead.</p>

<h3>Q&amp;A on Dental Knowledge (21)</h3>
<p>— Lin Jianxian</p>
<p>(Question 107) How to clean the baby's mouth?</p>
<p>Answer: A clean gauze should be cut into many small squares and soaked in a 2% boric acid solution. When needed, take two or three pieces and wipe the baby's mouth, up and down, right and left. After each feeding, it must be wiped once, and the gums must be rubbed more. This method can not only prevent various stomatitis and pharyngitis, but also stimulate the growth of deciduous teeth and reduce the pain when teething.</p>
<p>(Question 108) What should be paid attention to in the child's mouth during the teething period?</p>
<p>Answer: If it feels difficult to teethe, the above-mentioned gauze dipped in medicinal water should be rubbed more on the gums of the teething part. If the deciduous teeth are still delayed and cause distension and discomfort, a dentist should be asked to cut the gums, and the teething will be easier. If teething is painful and is allowed to continue, it can easily cause fever and uneasiness in children, and can easily cause stubborn gastrointestinal diseases.</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion on Pulmonary Tuberculosis (83)</h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Section 6: Specialized Stimulating Treatment – Ferrum Peptonatum</p>
<p>What is called etiological treatment? Ordinarily, for each disease, one seeks to eliminate the causative agent, such as killing the pathogenic bacteria in infectious diseases, which is called "causative therapy." Such truly effective drugs are called specific remedies, such as quinine for malaria. If there is no specific remedy for a disease that addresses the cause, then one can only try to eliminate the various symptoms that result from the disease's progression, such as clinical pain, danger, and exhaustion, which is called "symptomatic treatment." This type of treatment can relieve pain, prevent danger, and maintain physical strength, allowing the body's natural healing mechanisms to function more easily. Therefore, its therapeutic effect is similar to that of causative therapy. In common parlance, it is similar in meaning to the old medical terms "treating the root cause" and "treating the symptoms." We know that a specific remedy for pulmonary tuberculosis has been eagerly awaited, but has yet to appear. Therefore, symptomatic treatment with drugs is inevitably adopted by physicians.</p>
<p>What is the situation with symptomatic drug treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis? To answer this question, we must first mention its general symptoms, which are described in Chapter 7 of this book, including night sweats, cough, excessive phlegm, hemoptysis, elevated temperature, and so on. These are all sufficient to put the patient in a serious state or even endanger their life temporarily. Therefore, in addition to other treatments, physicians should also assess the immediate risks and benefits and use symptomatic drugs to eliminate or alleviate these symptoms, so as not to hinder the overall situation. Readers need to know about this aspect, so I will now describe it in detail below:</p>
<p>Elevated Temperature: Not every patient with pulmonary tuberculosis exhibits elevated temperature, but most cannot avoid it during the active phase. Even when it occurs, most of the time there is no need for antipyretic agents. Long-term injections of calcium preparations and Ferrum Peptonatum can also lower the temperature, but neither is a specific antipyretic agent, and other drugs can be inferred from this. However, if the patient's temperature is too high and their general condition is impaired, such as with headache, poor appetite, insomnia, etc., the physician cannot but adopt symptomatic treatment to seek rapid relief. There are almost countless drugs in this category, and physicians have their own opinions and clinical experience in their application. The most famous Aerbon tablets are generally regarded as a specific remedy for high fever in this disease, but this is not entirely true. Therefore, how to reduce high fever in this disease remains a major problem! However, even if the temperature does decrease after using medication, patients should not be overly optimistic, because this state is artificial and drug-induced. If the spread of the lesion itself does not stop, the temperature will rise again in a couple of days. Furthermore, after using antipyretics, patients are prone to collapse due to excessive sweating. Therefore, using antipyretics for elevated temperature is a last resort and should not be taken as a rule. Clinical application should also be minimized as much as possible!</p>
<p>Cough and Excessive Phlegm: These two symptoms often occur together, but there are also cases of severe coughing without phlegm. Although there are many symptomatic drugs for this type of condition, they can be broadly classified into expectorants and antitussives. Generally, expectorants are suitable for those with excessive phlegm, while antitussives can be used for those with dry coughs and no phlegm. If excessive coughing causes excessive movement of the lungs and the patient cannot sleep peacefully, then antitussives are even more indispensable. However, most of these drugs involve anesthetic effects, and physicians should proceed with caution. They are especially unsuitable for young children! In addition, calcium preparations have the effect of reducing secretions and can also help patients with excessive phlegm.</p>

<h3>Limited Trading; Forward US Dollar Slightly Easier</h3>

HSBC announced its rates, with both British and American rates unchanged, and the silver balancing tax unchanged. At this time, Mobil Oil was still buying, and the market hovered. After entering the market, banks still slightly offered, and the sentiment of Chinese merchants was weak. It seemed difficult to maintain at noon. However, the process was still quiet due to matching trades between banks. In the afternoon, the market was quiet, with banks and speculators mostly on the sidelines, resulting in a lack of buyers. The initial report on Indian silver was long by 2.2.2 annas, and the second report was unchanged, both having little impact.

<p>Securities: Bullish Traders Settle Swaps with Arbitrageurs; Old Bonds Have a Good Closing; Delivery to be Handled Today, Market Closed; Issue of Unified Public Bonds Still Pending</p>
<p>Yesterday, February 24th, the Chinese Securities Exchange announced that the February futures were the last day. It was also the last day for trading in various old bond futures. The market price was abnormally fluctuating because large bullish traders had found ways to swap with arbitrage accounts to avoid being released on the market, and bearish traders were covering their positions more frequently. The 96 issue alone fell, while the rest soared. This was entirely due to the supply and demand relationship of the chips, so the fluctuations should not be considered standard. March futures will probably not be launched. The issue of Unified Public Bonds will also be in April and May, because it will take until the end of April to exchange all five types of Unified Public Bonds. However, the exchange has not yet announced when the issue will begin. It will probably need to go through another meeting to resolve. However, it is feared that it will not be launched this week. In yesterday's market, short covering began immediately after the opening. There was a lot of buying in issue 48, and a lot of selling in issues 4 and 11. Many retail investors were also buying in small quantities, mostly in preparation for exchanging for Unified Public Bonds. In general, people believe that when the Unified Public Bonds are launched, there will be a better atmosphere. The market price therefore rose gradually, by 1 jiao to half a yuan. The second session was still very firm, with the 23rd issue and the regular 6th issue rising sharply by 7 jiao, and the rest also consistently pushing up by 3 to 5 jiao. The afternoon trend was even better, as the bullish traders reached a full compromise with the banks for arbitrage. The demobilization issue rose sharply by 9 jiao, and the 20th issue also rose by 7 jiao, but the 96th issue continued to decline slightly. This can be completely attributed to the leveraged long positions exiting. At the close of the afternoon session, the market conditions were chaotic, with high and low prices varying, and fluctuations of about half a yuan. As a result, only the 96th issue fell slightly by 1 yuan, while the rest rose uniformly, from 4 to 5 jiao to 1.1 to 1.5 yuan. The total number of transactions was 14.03 million yuan. The results of the fluctuations are listed below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan). From today until the 27th, the delivery of February futures will be handled and the market will be closed.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Banking Sector Buys in for Arbitrage; This Month's Yarn Not Crushed</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to be flat. This month was the last day of trading. Although sellers were preparing to supply actual goods, the pressure was heavy. However, although credit conditions were tight this year, they were slightly looser than last year. The banking sector continued to accept and buy in for arbitrage. The market price before delivery was therefore peaceful. The final closing price was 195 yuan, down 1 yuan from the same session in the January futures market.</p>
<h3>Yarn Nears a Fall Before Rising</h3>
<p>The yarn market opened, and this month was still under pressure from a sufficient supply of goods. The market appeared weak. However, the market remained firm until the end of the month. After the second session, the trend, except for this month, showed signs of stabilizing. Leveraged short positions were covering, and because current yarn sales were continuous, people's sentiment was tighter. As a result, the prices for each month rose by 3 to 5 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price, except for this month, which fell by 1 jiao. The afternoon session opened, and the market atmosphere showed slight weakness because the Osaka Sampin yarn market was weak and sentiment was sluggish. However, the situation for this month was peaceful. As a result, the prices for each month fell by 2 to 5 jiao compared to the morning session's closing price. It was found that Dafu sold 500 bales, Shenji sold 1750 bales, Gu Da sold 450 bales, Taichang sold 550 bales, Yichang sold 550 bales, Run sold 1800 bales, Yongchang sold 450 bales, sold 800 bales, Changyu sold 500 bales, and Yuanyi sold 5 bales. Zhengda bought 2950 bales, Feng bought 600 bales, Senkang bought 750 bales, Chang bought 2450 bales, Yongda bought 500 bales, Xincheng bought 500 bales, Dafu bought 550 bales, and Yichang bought 350 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for January are listed below.</p>
<h3>Local Yarn Trend Still Smooth</h3>
<p>Sales of current yarn are good, with local yarn accounting for the majority. It was found that all the groups bought a total of 1485 bales throughout the day, and the selling price rose by more than 5 jiao. The amount of purchases by each group is listed below:</p>
<p>Guangdong 25 Changsha 95 Inland 865 Trade 105 Shantou 45 Ningbo 20 Tianjin 100 Sichuan 100 Haizhou 25 Xiamen 5</p>
<h3>Bullish and Bearish Forces Equally Matched in Cotton Futures</h3>
<p>The cotton market remained firm, and the situation became increasingly tight. Moreover, the general trade supplied a large amount of actual goods for delivery. However, the market still remained firm, which was due to the financial sector's firm intention to accept all of it. Yesterday was the last day of trading, and the final closing price was 41.3 yuan, which was 1.3 yuan higher than the previous day's 40 yuan.</p>
<h3>This Month's Cotton Final Closing Still Up</h3>
<p>The pre-market opening for cotton futures showed the US cotton market closed, and the Indian cotton market weak, falling 0.75 to 2 rupees. The Osaka Sampin cotton market fell 2.3 jiao. The market was listless and without energy. However, the bearish pressure was severe this month, but the bullish traders were preparing to take delivery. After the second session, the market state turned higher, and as a result, the prices for each month rose by 5 fen to 2 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon session opened, and this month was the last day. The situation remained tense, but sellers still dumped additional positions. As a result, this month's price rose by 1 jiao compared to the morning session's closing price, and the prices for distant months rose or fell by 5 fen to 1 jiao. It was found that Dafu sold 1200 dan, Mei Ji sold 1000 dan, Changfeng sold 1100 dan, Shengyuan sold 1400 dan, Yongchang sold 1500 dan, Tonghe sold 2000 dan, Changhe sold 1700 dan, Jinchang sold 1600 dan, Feng sold 2200 dan, Ruidai sold 2400 dan, and Xincheng sold 2500 dan. Dafeng bought 2800 dan, Zhengda bought 7100 dan, Senkang bought 3900 dan, Shenji bought 1000 dan, Tongji bought 1300 dan, Daji bought 5800 dan, Yuanyi bought 2900 dan, and Yichang bought 1500 dan.

<h3>Disappointment in US Cotton; Indian Cotton Still Weak Last Week</h3>
<p>After rising repeatedly last week, Bombay cotton prices weakened again due to disappointment in US cotton. Trading in the Far East remained quiet. Mainland and continued to need Oumura and Pingo, so prices were firmer, and export inquiries decreased as a result. Subsequently, a lot was shipped out from Europe. The movement of Bailuoxi cotton improved and was firmer than , because there were inquiries from domestic yarn mills. The attached statistics are as follows (unit: 1000 bales)</p>
<h3>Sampin Yarn and Cotton All Weak</h3>
<p>An Osaka telegram on the 24th reported that Sampin yarn futures fell 0.5 to 1.5 yuan, with the near month at 187.6 yuan and the distant month at 188.4 yuan. Cotton futures fell 0.35 to 0.5 yuan, with the near month at 60.55 yuan and the distant month at 58.25 yuan.</p>
<h3>Grains: Current Flour Inventory Not Abundant</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market initially showed near-term strength and distant-term weakness, but then stabilized uniformly. With overseas wheat quotations, Chicago had no market, and Canada was up 8 fen to 1 jiao. The market sentiment, due to the approaching near-term delivery, although sales were , was good because the inventory was not abundant and the mills were taking back their chips. The price was good by 1 fen. New flour for distant delivery was initially stable, but then the sentiment weakened as the mills dumped their positions, falling 1 to 2 fen from the initial opening. By the time the afternoon session opened, the near-term market rose by 1 to 2 fen again because the Yong gang also rose to buy and the mills continued to take back their positions. Transactions in distant months were not smooth, but prices were also raised by 2 fen. Observing the subsequent movements, there may be a continued upward trend in the near term.</p>
<h3>Near-Term Wheat Expected to Continue Rising</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market opened in the morning with the near-term market hovering. The distant-term market weakened. It was heard that the inland gang slightly took back positions for the March delivery. The market situation was settled. For distant deliveries such as June and July, it was heard that the Jinpu Road gang slightly arbitraged. The June delivery fell by 5 to 6 fen, and the July delivery was unchanged. By the time the afternoon session opened, the current month had not opened. The distant-term market also rose by 3 to 5 fen because the sky was still overcast and the flour market was good. From then on, the near-term market was expected to continue to rise. In the current wheat market, high interest rates were also raised by 2 fen, while the middle and secondary levels were unchanged. Wheat from Suzhou, Huai'an, and Shandong was quoted at 5.27 yuan, Jiang wheat at 5.25 yuan, and Tiantai wheat at 5.19 yuan. Fuxin sold 2000 bales and Shenda sold 300 bales.</p>

<h3>Dalian Gang Actively Handling Zhongguan Thin Rice</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than 30 sources from various gangs (with about 7000 shi of goods). Sales in this street were flat, so the market for thick early japonica rice softened, and prices were adjusted by 5 fen. Although demand for thin early rice was not smooth, the Dalian gang was quite active and selected Zhongguan goods. As a result, although only slightly over 1000 bales were sold, prices were stable and high. The prices for the middle and secondary grades were decent. The supply and demand for Du Yangjian rice were similar, without any change. The prices for Yinyuan also remained the same.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were 26 or 27 sources from various routes below the river. The sales of white japonica rice in the market slowed down, and the market was flat. Retail sales of early thin rice were flat, and prices were peaceful. Retail sales of Yangdujian rice were still decent, and prices remained stable. Although sales of the rice from other ports were average, the customers were quite firm, so prices rose slightly. Sales of Baiyuan rice were evenly split between arrivals and sales, and prices did not fluctuate much. The prices of other goods remained stable.</p>
<h3>Customers Inland, and Storers' Sales All Smooth; Prices Rise by 1.5 Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rice market only saw Jiangxi rice arriving at the port, and other goods were scarce. Sales were also active. Because this street continued to smoothly handle outside goods, and the inland gang smoothly handled various kinds of brown rice, and the storers absorbed Jiangxi mechanical early and late rice, the market immediately showed signs of improvement. Prices were 1.5 jiao and 1 jiao higher than the previous day. If the storers become more greedy now, the market price may increase further. The total number of Jiangxi rice opened for sale was 4262 bales, Xiang rice 320 bales, desert brown rice 822 bales, Beijing brown rice 45 bales, Anqing machine rice 275 bales, and Wintai rice over 1000 bales.</p>
<h3>Soybeans Not Affected by Dalian; Soybean Inventory Less Than 90,000 Bales</h3>
<p>Yesterday's soybean market, although the Dalian market price fell quite a bit and the standards in this city continued to weaken, the trend for current was still stable, as in the previous week. The main reason was that sources were scarce and the inventory was insufficient. The total inventory in the city was about 90,000 bales of various wheels and and the sales of soybean cake were unremitting, which contributed to this. The market traded 16,000 to 17,000 pieces of both term and spot factory cake. Therefore, the sentiment was not yet affected by Dalian. It was estimated that the factories opened Tuohe 1500 bales and in other ports. The price of Guigedou was the same as Saturday.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: White Sugar Continues to Fall, Green and Red Sugars Look Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend remained soft. The guild's quoted price for Grade 24 raw white sugar spot was 22.40 yuan, with no transactions. For transit goods, the previous day's dark market price was 7.30 yuan; yesterday's quoted price remained unchanged, but slightly lower by 0.10 yuan. Our factory's refined white sugar continued to fall by 0.10 yuan: Zhenji No. 1 was at 21.10 yuan, No. 2 at 20.90 yuan, No. 3 at 0.70 yuan, No. 4 at 0.50 yuan, and No. 5 at 0.30 yuan. There were not significant fluctuations in East red and white sugar, except for No. 8, where the spot price was 22.025 yuan and transit goods were 7.025 yuan; both saw transactions, slightly lower by 0.025 yuan. Domestic green and red sugars, although initially supported by firm quotations, could have risen further, but daily sales became sluggish. Moreover, the production cost of a substantial amount of Chaozhou green and red sugar has shown signs of weakening. The market is expected to follow this downward trend.</p>
<p>The Sugar Industry Cooperative Company's bid-exchange period ended yesterday. A total of 1,680 bags of No. 5 raw white sugar were priced at 22.40 yuan. This was 0.10 yuan lower than last Friday, with 70 bags traded. 1,000 bags of No. 2 refined white sugar were priced at 21.25 yuan, with 400 bags traded. Additionally, 688 bags of No. 4 were priced at 21.05 yuan but remained unsold, all falling by 0.05 yuan compared to previous prices.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Yokohama Silk Prices Plummet</h3>
<p>In recent months, overseas spring sales have been sluggish, and raw material demand has been weak, leading to frequent declines in silk prices. Yesterday, the Yokohama spot price was close to 700 yuan. Although it rebounded by 15 yuan in the morning, it was still about 100 yuan lower than at the beginning of the month. The price fluctuations of Chinese silk have historically followed those of Japanese silk, making it even more difficult for domestic prices to rise. Currently, the price for Dayang silk, 20.22 denier, is 740 yuan, and 13.15 denier is 780 yuan. However, due to sluggish trading, further declines are still possible.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Foreign Firms Active, Tung Oil Prices Soar</h3>
<p>Since the opening of the spring market, the price of white tung oil has remained relatively stable, fluctuating around 50 yuan. However, in the previous week, all foreign firms aggressively sought both spot and futures contracts, pushing the selling price in Hankou to 56 yuan per dan. By last week, the upward trend intensified, reaching 61.50 yuan, as European and American countries were eager to secure supplies. As a result, tung oil exports in January reached the top position, surpassing even silk and tea. According to national annual production statistics, the supply is only sufficient for ten months of exports, leaving a two-month gap each year. Last year, exports were interrupted from July to August, causing the price to soar to a maximum of 87 yuan per dan, and even leading to a shortage of supply. This year, a similar situation is expected to occur in the autumn. Currently, most oil mills in producing areas only have enough work for another two months, with production and sales occurring simultaneously, leaving no stockpiles. Meanwhile, foreign firms require 5,000 to 6,000 tons per month, and it is predicted that a similar situation to last year will occur in July and August. Last night, a telegram from Hankou reported that foreign firms were offering 62.60 yuan, a significant difference from the supply price, making a further market increase inevitable. Most of the exported tung oil from this city comes from Zhejiang, but the tung oil mills in eastern Zhejiang have not yet fully commenced operations, and it will take another month before new supplies arrive. However, some forward sales have not yet been completed, so when demand surges in the future, there may not be enough supply to meet the large export volume, which is expected.</p>
<p>Headline: Western Woolen Fabrics Fail in the North, Eastern Woolens Take Their Place, Many Western Goods Retailers Close Down</p>
<p>In recent years, the demand for woolen fabrics from Tianjin merchants has greatly declined, and this spring is even more sluggish. The main reason is due to the successful sales of Japanese goods. Japanese goods offer a wider variety of designs and are cheaper than those from elsewhere, further reducing the market for Shanghai woolen fabrics. The Western woolen fabric industry is largely being defeated. Currently, many Western woolen fabric stores in Tianjin that specialize in Western goods have been closing down. Generally, their remaining stock is being transported to southern China and other ports for sale. According to merchants from Tianjin, the woolen fabric market only has potential for development in southern China and Sichuan. Sales in northern China are difficult to stimulate.</p>
<h3>Investigation: Shanghai Price Index for January (Continued)</h3>
<p>The import price index, with a total index of 141.1, decreased by 0.3% compared to the previous month and increased by 4.4% compared to the same month last year. Comparing the three sub-indices with the previous month, raw materials and manufactured goods slightly decreased, while consumer goods slightly increased. The raw materials index increased by 2.1%. Although copper, tin, and various types of timber all increased in price, the imported staples of cotton, wheat, and tobacco leaves all decreased. Lead prices also depreciated, causing the overall index to fall. The manufactured goods index decreased by 0.3%. Various metals experienced price declines due to sluggish sales at the end of the year. The sales prices of newsprint and coated paper also weakened. The consumer goods index increased by 0.5%. Flour slightly increased in price following domestic products. Saigon rice, white sugar, ginseng, fresh bridges, and White Pagoda oil all became more expensive.</p>
<p>Cost of Living Index: The total index was 111.0, an increase of 1.6% compared to the previous month and an increase of 0.1% compared to the same month last year. Of the five sub-indices, most increased compared to the previous month, except for rent. The food index increased by 4.9%. Although the retail price of white rice slightly decreased, various vegetables and meat dishes generally increased in price due to higher demand at the end of the lunar year. The increases in green vegetables and spinach were particularly significant. The fuel index increased by 3.8%. The clothing index increased by 1.1% due to brisk sales and price increases in firewood and coarse cloth. Among miscellaneous items, the index decreased by 3.5% due to slightly lower cigarette prices.</p>
<p>A comparison of the various indices for this month with the previous month and the same month last year is listed below:</p>

<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Fang Zheng)</p>
<p>Walking in pitch darkness is certainly difficult, but if we can take careful steps, we will eventually emerge from the darkness. The same is true in the society in which we live! If we can walk our own path, without seeking shortcuts, without fearing difficulties, and strive forward, we will eventually achieve our goals.</p>
<p>People often admire light and hate darkness, but light is not always good, and darkness is not always bad. Consider the silkworm, a good example, which courts disaster by admiring the light.</p>
<p>Therefore, we should admire darkness, because the light gained from darkness is the true light. If we blindly admire the false, temporary light, we will not only fail to gain it but also risk ruin and disgrace!</p>
<h3>The Great Battle Between Science and Flesh and Blood</h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>Prophets around the world say that 1936 is the year of the Second World War. In particular, the British writer H.G. Wells has predicted the great changes of the world in a hundred years, and it seems that there will be no mistakes. Among them, the situation in the Far East in the next ten years makes people shudder! Alas! Now he has been right on a few points, which is really unfortunate. However, whether it will cause a major war, there is no significant sign to prove it. The fire between Italy and Abyssinia was still in the previous year, so if this powder keg explodes, judging from the recent advances in science, it is really terrible. I will describe it briefly as follows:</p>
<p>The children of bullets: Their power is extremely fierce, enough to penetrate all obstacles and buildings of the enemy. Their production takes only one day and can produce 480,000 bullets.</p>
<p>Rotating cannons: They can fire more than 1,000 rounds per minute and destroy the enemy's defenses, leaving nothing behind.</p>
<p>Machine guns: Weighing only two kilograms, they can fire 600 times per minute and can continue to advance, used for charging.</p>
<p>Violent poison gas: It can be used freely within a radius of 320 kilometers, spreading and filling without fail.</p>
<p>The invention of death rays: Their manufacturing method is absolutely secret. Whether it is a strong bridge or a stable fortress, they can all be destroyed.</p>
<p>There are countless other sophisticated combat materials being researched and manufactured in the factory, which have not yet been revealed.</p>
<p>Think! If everyone prepares for war in this way, and once they clash, they will be tested one by one on the battlefield. Humph! Human limbs and bones remain the same, without any progress. Trying to fight against these sharp weapons, who will win, who will lose? In fact, victory and defeat are just a name, not a permanent residence. I think that when they are at their peak, the army will be used to sweep the world with surplus, and when they decline, they will be defeated, even the most outstanding hero will not be able to save his life. However, can the money lost by being commanded by him and ravaged by him be calculated? One general succeeds, ten thousand bones wither. Why take the limited flesh and blood to mess up the earth, to win the day of triumph and the glory of being rewarded? Who says that human beings are the spirit of all things? I say it is too foolish. Therefore, I finally hope that this year, the god of war will never come, and a bright and dazzling flower of peace will be released, shining on the world.</p>
<h3>Contemporary Riddles and Wu Dialect Riddles</h3>
<p>— Shi Jiu</p>
<p>Around the Lantern Festival, the Wumen Lequn Society held a literary riddle contest. Before the spring lanterns, the shadows of people were bustling, and there had been no such grand occasion in twenty years. The various riddles hanging were dazzling and too numerous to mention. Now, based on my memory, I have recorded several contemporary riddles and Wu dialect riddles to share with fellow enthusiasts.</p>
<h3>The son needs tuition fees, the father sighs</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>"Dad is learning!"</p>
<p>New Year's Day riddle — Hu Wenhu · Paying New Year's greetings according to the old calendar — Chen — · Acknowledging Edward VIII as heir — Xu Shiying · Lord and vassal sharing the same fate at Yashan — Wang Luyi · Maple leaves rustling in autumn — Zhu Shusheng · Money scattered, feeling unbearable cold — Liu Haisu · Qin's advising on expelling guests — Wang Yongbin · Looking back at the empty beams — Gu Mengyu · Ten years of Huadiao wine, capable of drinking a stone — Chen Shaokuan · Purity lies within oneself — Hu Hanmin · A thatched hut is the best place to write the character "祠" (ancestral hall) — Jiao Yitang · Those who sing praises to the emperor do not go to Zhu Jun but go to Shun and Yu — Dai Chuanxian · Fence along the street — Zhang Daofan · Father, son, husband, wife, and brother — Wu Zhongxin (white hair) · A single grain is not given to others — Yan Shenyu.

<p>A total of seventeen contemporary riddles and ten Wu dialect riddles are recorded on the right. Although times have changed, the riddle of "Yashan" is still deeply terrifying, and I often sigh for a long time. The maker of this riddle must be a caring person.</p>
<h3>Jin Lü Qu</h3>
<p>— (Liu Yazi)</p>
<p>Written after hearing about the affairs of his friend Qi Hua's girlfriend, Miss So-and-So</p>
<p>Sharing the illness with Old Meicun. For years, I have been living in the grass, a shameful time; I am ashamed to be like the bearded 士, who can achieve immortality with a beautiful woman. Only the iron chains of mandarin ducks evoke old memories, cruel officials use severe punishment, cruelly destroying soft jade hands wrapped in silk, blood and flesh flying, determined to sell herself to redeem Wenji. Resolving to break off ties and sending letters from the distant horizon, the nets relaxed later. How could she willingly be unfaithful? Her heroic spirit is as high as the mountains and the Big Dipper, willing to cherish her youthful years like flowers, sacrificing her life in the marketplace. Better than the happy marriage of a noble lady, fulfilling her solitary anger and indulging in strong wine.</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 24: Weighing profit over beauty, the husband reluctantly gives up love, ambitious men with strong feet venture into the wilderness.</p>
<p>Now, let's consider that brother has made a slip of the tongue, so we don't need to discuss business, and we don't need to joke. Let's just drink and talk about other things. Since I said the wrong thing, I should be punished with three cups of wine. So he took the wine pot and wine cup, stood in front of him, poured three cups of wine one after another, raised them himself, drank them, and laughed: "I deserve to be punished, I deserve to be punished. Please forgive me, please forgive me." Bei Hai didn't really feel angry at what he said, and when he saw that he had drunk three cups of wine, he had nothing to say, so he also laughed: "I am not angry with Mr. Jia, it's just that if others hear these words, it is easy to cause a misunderstanding." Jia Duocai saw that he didn't seem angry at all, and the smile on his face deepened again. He returned to his seat and began to offer wine and dishes. Sure enough, throughout the meal, Jia Duocai didn't mention a single word about the land or Yueying. This made Bei Hai feel a little guilty, and he had to thank him and leave. At the same time, he also felt a knot in his heart, which he could only untie by seeing Cheng Zhiqian. Therefore, after leaving the Little Western Paradise's dining department, he went straight to the courtyard in the back. He stopped at the window of Cheng Zhifen's room, and saw Zhang Jiefu wearing a mandarin jacket, with a yellow badge hanging properly on the front buttons. Naturally, his face was full of smiles, and from afar, he heard him say: "I am very familiar with the people here. The salary is really low, only sixty yuan, but after a 20% discount, it is even less. However, my intention is not here. The director also told me that I might as well stay in the department for two months, and then send me out when there is a good vacancy. I don't want to do it, right? First, I can't ignore the face of the person who introduced me, and second, having a job in hand is still a source of income every month, which can help with the expenses of the hotel." Although the director is from the north, he has been there for many years, and he talks to us southerners very congenially, as if he were from the same hometown, so he is very polite to me. Zhiqian walked back and forth in the room with his hands behind his back, his eyebrows tightly furrowed. It seemed that he was very annoyed. Bei Hai jumped into the room and laughed: "Mr. Cheng, I have a very interesting piece of news to report to you." Zhiqian smiled and nodded, saying: "The newspapers have reported it in detail, isn't it about Jia Duocai's marriage problem?" Bei Hai: "Has this matter really been reported in the newspapers?" (407)</p>
<h3>What I Saw</h3>
<p>— Ziming</p>
<p>The skylark opened its voice in the milky white morning light. At the head of a township street, there was a woman who looked about thirty or forty years old, with her head hunched down and white breath coming out of her mouth. She was holding a pint measure in her hand, with a small bamboo sieve about two feet in diameter under her arm, and a cloth bag. She was walking towards the three-way intersection of the main street leading farmers into town. She placed the bag on the road covered with white frost.</p>
<p>She stood there, looking around from time to time: if a pedestrian came running with something heavy, her locked eyebrows would immediately unfold. Rice, wheat, beans – she bought everything. When it was time to market, she would take what she had bought to the big stores, hoping to make a small profit. She could earn about ten copper coins for every pint of rice. But she only did business in a few pints of rice and wheat every day! She stands on the street every year, every month, every morning; her colleagues compete with each other; business is declining; it is common for her to go home empty-handed! (Ziming)</p>
<p>Small Gardening</p>
<h3>The Art of Cultivating Potted Plum Trees (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Hu Chuyu</p>
<p>In the method of cultivating potted plum trees with soil, the first emphasis is on the soil. Normally, three parts black soil, four parts red soil, two parts decayed leaf soil, and one part sand are mixed together. However, some people use only black soil and decayed leaf soil, or red soil and decayed leaf soil, and some even use only fertile loam or only red soil. If only yellow sand is used for cultivation, although it can grow for a while, it will definitely not have good results for perennial cultivation. Because the plum roots are slender, when using only yellow sand, it is often difficult to remove the old sand during transplanting because the fine roots are tightly bonded. If they are forcibly dug out, the fine roots will inevitably be damaged, causing various difficulties in cultivation. Therefore, it is better not to use yellow sand. In the past, soil for plum trees was often dried in the cold season before use, in order to make it easy to decompose, and the microorganisms and insect eggs in the soil would also die after being exposed to the sun. No matter what kind of soil is used, it must be sieved through a fine-mesh sieve to remove the powder, because soil with too much powder is commonly known as blind soil. Blind soil has almost no gaps, and water cannot pass through it. The moisture content and air circulation are very unsuitable, and the decomposition of fertilizer is also very unsuitable. If too much water is poured, it will become muddy and easily cause the plum roots to rot. However, when sieving soil with a fine-mesh sieve, one should be careful. First, the soil should be placed in a dry place, and when sieving, the hands should be shaken about three feet above the sieve. When the powder falls, it is blown away by a gentle breeze, and the fine and coarse particles of soil can naturally be separated. It is very suitable to plant the coarse-grained soil at the bottom of the pot and gradually sprinkle the fine-grained soil on top.</p>
<p>Transplanting</p>
<p>It is best to transplant once a year, because it allows the plants to absorb insufficient nutrients from the soil. If the small amount of soil in the pot is not transplanted, it will hinder the development of new roots. Therefore, after transplanting, the inactive old roots can be removed, and new soil can be added to promote the growth of new roots. The best time for transplanting is from late October in autumn to March of the following year. If it is April, the buds have already sprouted, then it is not suitable to transplant. If it is a late planting, and you want to maintain flowering in late March to early April, then transplanting in late autumn or early winter is also possible. The method of transplanting is to slowly remove two-thirds of the old soil from the pot first, and then trim the fine roots in a windless and quiet place. The procedure must be fast, otherwise exposing the roots to sunlight and ventilation for too long will easily cause them to dry out and become damaged. When selecting a flower pot, a shallow pot can be used if the focus is on admiring the flowers, and a deep pot must be used to cultivate well-developed branches and leaves. Spread a layer of coarse red soil or coarse gravel on the bottom of the pot, and then use the dry soil mentioned above. The soil should not be packed too tightly, so that the trunk of the transplanted tree will not sway. Then, use a sprayer to water the pot until water flows out of the bottom, and then place it in a windless place. After a few days, it can be moved outside. After transplanting, it is essential to avoid rain. After twenty days, fertilizer can be applied. It is never recommended to mix fertilizer into the soil first, as it will harm the fine roots.</p>
<p>Fertilizer</p>
<p>Plum trees like fertilizer, but the amount and timing of fertilization have a great impact on the number of flowers that bloom in the coming year. If you want the branches and shoots of young trees to grow vigorously, then only nitrogen fertilizer should be used. If you want beautiful flowers to bloom, then phosphate fertilizer should be added. Commonly used fertilizers include fish manure or other animal-based fertilizers, as well as human waste. If you want to keep it clean, then rapeseed cake is the main ingredient. The method of using rapeseed cake is to place several pieces the size of a finger on the surface of the pot soil. If you want to fertilize completely, you should make rapeseed cake water fertilizer. To make water fertilizer, put the powder of rapeseed cake or broken pieces into a bottle, pour in clear water, about one liter of rapeseed cake and three liters of water. After two months (from winter to spring), it will rot, and the effect will be very fast. Add two or three times more water before applying. The fertilization time is from April to before the plum season, about three times. The amount used should be enough to make the pot soil fully moist. However, when fertilizing, the pot soil should be dried first, because it is not suitable for soil with too much moisture to absorb fertilizer. Usually, apply fertilizer in the afternoon or evening, as a substitute for watering.</p>
<p>The flower buds of plum trees can be determined from the beginning of the plum season to the end of March. If you fertilize sufficiently before the plum season, the new shoots that emerge will be very vigorous. In addition to the rapeseed cake fertilizer mentioned above, superphosphate of lime can be used, one teaspoon per pot each time, two or three times, and the flowers that bloom will be more vivid (but the watering procedure is very important). After the plum season, it is safer not to fertilize. There is no need to fertilize in summer either, or you can add some phosphate to the very diluted rapeseed cake water fertilizer. If you want the branches and leaves to be lush, then thin water fertilizer should be added from time to time in summer. If you want the roots to be developed and the flowers to be lush, then using superphosphate of lime or bone meal and other phosphate powder fertilizers will have the fastest effect. The most suitable time to apply spring fertilizer is from late September to early October in autumn. At this time, a strong fertilizer must be used once, commonly known as flower fertilizer. After using this strong fertilizer, the flowers in the following spring will definitely bloom beautifully. It is ineffective to apply winter fertilizer in the cold season, so it is better not to apply it. It is harmful to apply solid fertilizer in summer. In Japanese botanical gardens, when the roots of transplanted plants are able to move, thin water fertilizer is used once a day instead of water, but this is only suitable for using sand as the main ingredient. If soil is mainly used, it will not work. Bird manure fertilizer can also be used in place of rapeseed cake, because bird manure contains a lot of phosphorus, which is very suitable. However, when using bird manure, do not add superphosphate and bone meal.</p>

<h3>Mrs. Sanger and Birth Control</h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>Mrs. Sanger, an American renowned for advocating birth control and currently the president of the International Birth Control Research Association, recently embarked on her second world tour to promote her new birth control methods. She arrived in Hong Kong on the 20th of this month and will soon come to Shanghai to lecture on birth control to various circles in the city. This news is extremely welcome.</p>
<p>Birth control is now an important social issue. Unrestricted births in various countries have led to overpopulation. As a result, individual lives are becoming increasingly difficult, and social problems are becoming more complex. Moreover, according to the demographer Malthus, population increases geometrically, while food increases arithmetically. A country's population can double every twenty-five years. Therefore, if the population is not limited, food shortages will inevitably occur. Isn't the competition and contention between countries in the world today caused by population problems? It can be seen that birth control is a problem worthy of great attention.</p>
<p>However, although birth control is now generally accepted, there are still many who oppose it. Mrs. Sanger's previous decision to travel around the world to promote birth control gained considerable sympathy from various countries. However, at the same time, some people strongly opposed it and tried to prevent her from spreading her message. Even her decision to come to our country has been met with strong attacks from a certain Jesuit pastor, who accuses Mrs. Sanger's behavior as a manifestation of the moral decay of American sexual life. In fact, if this pastor opposes birth control from a religious standpoint, there may be some justification, but to say that her behavior is a manifestation of the moral decay of American sexual life is ridiculous. However, this pastor is not the only one who opposes birth control. Recently, Germany and Italy not only do not support birth control, but also vigorously encourage births, but they have other intentions in implementing this policy, namely, to have more cannon fodder on the future battlefield.</p>
<p>Finally, we have one more thing to say about birth control. That is, in the past, the results of promoting birth control were that only intellectuals practiced it, while ordinary people still had unlimited births. As a result, future generations will see the gradual elimination of the excellent and the increase of the foolish. This is also something that birth control advocates must pay attention to.</p>
<h3>The Return Journey</h3>
<p>— Tian Qi</p>
<p>With the arrival of winter, rainfall has become scarce, making navigation upstream on the Xuan River increasingly difficult; beyond Sancha River, shallow shoals become more frequent. When the boat runs aground on a shoal, it often takes an hour or two for people to get into the river and dig a channel to clear the path; if it still doesn't work, the crew has to get into the river and use poles, shoulders, and hands, like ants moving a fly – the people in the river shouting while the engineer on the boat revs up the engine to push forward. In such situations, although the crew curses the heavens and the earth, sweating profusely, the passengers sitting comfortably in the cabin feel even more anxious, and idle complaints are inevitable. Traveling alone is already the most boring thing, but seeing such a situation and hearing the crew's pig-slaughtering shouts, the heart feels even more disturbed.</p>
<p>The boat reached Jiexikou when it was already past five o'clock. Looking ahead, the sun had long set behind a large mountain, and there were still five or six miles to Songzhen. The boat stopped at the edge of a shallow sandy beach, and the purser came out and announced publicly that the boat could no longer go upstream, and that passengers should go ashore and walk to the town, with their luggage handed over to the porters sent by the inn to pick up guests, who would hire small boats to transport it. Immediately, there was an uproar. Most of the winter travelers were returning from Southeast Asia to spend the New Year, and their luggage was either bulky or they were accompanied by children. It was getting dark, and no one wanted to walk five or six miles. But the boat could not go upstream, so there was no choice, and it was said that all the passengers on the small steamers had to walk to the town after reaching Jiexikou. Everyone was at a loss and had no choice but to walk. On the dimly lit road, more than a hundred passengers, with children calling for their parents, groped forward in a chaotic mess. Fortunately, it was the climate of the Lingnan region, and even in winter, there would not be any freezing north winds. When people walked past the doors of houses, they aroused the barking of village dogs, which echoed each other, and for a moment, the voices of people and dogs turned the quiet mountain village into a chaotic mess. According to a merchant walking in front of me, if it had been two years ago, the villagers, frightened like startled birds by the soldiers engaged in rural pacification, would have been scared out of their wits again, thinking that some trouble had broken out. His words suddenly triggered the association of a "foreign guest," who carried some gold and silver with him and, hearing this, quickly asked:</p>
<p>— Then, then, aren't we afraid of bad guys attacking and robbing us on the road?</p>
<p>These "foreign guests" are quite pitiful. For the sake of life, for the sake of raising their parents and children, they do not hesitate to leave their homes, cross the seas, and go to foreign lands thousands of miles away. After eight or ten years of hard work, shedding blood and sweat, they are fortunate enough to save a little money before returning, hoping to live a peaceful and stable life after returning to their hometowns, but who would have expected that everything in their hometowns had changed?</p>
<p>Fortunately, the large group of travelers did not encounter the situation that the "foreign guest" had feared. Around eight o'clock, after passing a hilltop, they saw the lights of the town, and everyone suddenly felt relieved and quickened their pace. The town was originally on the north side of the river, and the ferry had been called by those in the lead. Looking across the river, the lights flickered along the northern bank, reflected in the water; further away, the fishing lights flickered, faintly visible on the river surface, making it seem even more secluded and beautiful, and the heart felt cleansed. It was just a pity that the tired body and the hardships of the journey had worn me out, and any leisurely mood had long since vanished; otherwise, the beautiful scenery of this mountain stream night crossing would have been enough for me to express the ancient sentiments of the ancients.</p>
<p>When I arrived in town, the streets were deserted, and the shops were all closed. After turning a corner, the front suddenly lit up brightly. Upon closer inspection, the doors of four or five shops in a row were wide open, with a cloth curtain hanging in the middle, with the name of the ×× company written on it in colored ink. Inside, there were screens on both sides of the doorway, with red paper posters of "Dragon's Roar" and "Tiger's Howl" pasted on one side. The middle of the shop was densely packed with people, and the silver coins clattered. It turned out that even in this small mountain town, fan-tan gambling houses were so prosperous!</p>
<p>I was extremely tired. When I took off my clothes and washed, I noticed two scars on my leather shoes from rubbing against stones, and I felt a great pity; after falling asleep, I was awakened by the soldiers checking at night, who interrogated me in every possible way. I really didn't understand what great crime a passing traveler had committed? Coming to the interior, it turned out that even the freedom to sleep had to be taken away!</p>
<h3>Nonsense</h3>
<p>— (Fool)</p>
<p>According to the Ministry of Judicial Administration, the statistics for divorce cases in the 22nd year of the Republic amounted to as many as 448 cases. In fact, the number of divorces that have not been publicly judged by the court is probably several times this number. Tan Lao San said, there is a slogan about the bitterness of youth, "graduate immediately lose job." In the future, the union of men and women will surely become a slogan of "marry immediately divorce."</p>
<p>Prominent figures in the Hong Kong medical community on the 20th invited Mrs. Sanger to lecture on the issue of birth control. Many people listened. Women's circles in Peiping also plan to invite Mrs. Sanger to lecture. Tan Lao San said, nowadays parents not only have difficulty resolving the issue of raising children, but also the issue of education is even more difficult. Is this why Mrs. Sanger is in the limelight? Someone said, no, I am afraid there are many remnants of those who would doom the nation.</p>

<h3>Pulling the Towrope</h3>
<p>— Laoxin</p>
<p>— A Story of Maritime Navigation —</p>
<p>This downstream boat carried a lot of Wuzhou goods, like cinnamon twigs and mulberry mistletoe, heavily loaded in the cargo hold. We couldn't complain, because the owner had instructed us when we left Yanchang: "It's not easy to make a living in this world. This downstream boat must carry some local goods. We can unload them in places like Zhiyao and Quanli Market. If we're lucky, everyone can get a bonus." Although we didn't want to, even Lao Gui was furious!</p>
<p>"During the New Year, a single boat voyage takes people half a month. Is that really necessary? Don't other people have families and need to go back for a visit?..."</p>
<p>But these complaints couldn't overcome the owner's orders. As Third Master said:</p>
<p>"Who are you eating the rice of?"</p>
<p>Like selling piglets in the style of one-seven, we were completely sold. Unless the owner didn't want our lives, there was still no way to refuse when he did.</p>
<p>So, after unloading from the river mouth and transferring to barges, we had to pole this cargo ship, which was like a big elephant, one pole at a time to reach the docks. One trip to the docks takes ten or eight days, who wouldn't be angry?</p>
<p>"May your ancestors for eighteen generations... you're taking my old man's life!"</p>
<p>Lao Qi complained. Third Master also became amiable at this time, probably having loosened up a lot of "treasure" at his gambling den with his sworn brothers in Jiufang Street, Wuzhou. If he hadn't lost at Pai Gow, he must have been twisted at Tian Jiu. That's why he was so listless and uninterested in anything.</p>
<p>The boat poled past Baokou. Turning left into Dachongkou, we prepared to rush to Zhongyin to rest at noon and unload goods. As we prepared to moor at the wharf, everyone became enthusiastic. Fifth Uncle was the first to stand up, poling deeply and far, shouting –</p>
<p>"Yo-ay-yo-ya, come on! – Ah,</p>
<p>May the ghosts curse you poor – yo-ah, ah...</p>
<p>Top it off with force!"</p>
<p>We poled the boat along, one pole at a time. Dachongkou was as narrow as trouser legs, and shallow, with a muddy bottom a foot deep. When the pole was pushed down, it couldn't be pulled back up. When forced, the cargo ship trembled as if someone had tickled it. Everyone was anxious and couldn't pole it.</p>
<p>"Shameless bastards, cursing what ancestors? If you can't pole, go pull! If you want to eat fat meat, go to Chongqing."</p>
<p>Third Master's temper was as moldy as pickled plums.</p>
<p>"Pull, you bastard!"</p>
<p>Lao Gui was the first to grab the towrope, pulling it hard with both hands to test whether the towrope, which hadn't been replaced in three generations of his ancestors, was strong. Then he erected a stick in the hole in the bow of the boat. Following him, Lao Qi and I also took a towrope, tied one end to the stick, and made a quick knot to secure it to our arms. The boat leaned slightly to the left, and we jumped onto the levee, slipping on the mud. We quickly took a few more steps, past the bow of the boat. Lao Gui went first, I was in the middle, and Lao Qi, afraid of falling flat on his face, followed behind me.</p>
<p>The levee road, which had been flooded by the West River, hadn't been repaired yet. It was as uneven as little mud hills. Moreover, it had been raining for two days, and the road had turned into a muddy paste. We walked up, relying entirely on the strength of our ten toes, inserting them into the mud to gain traction. We believed that if we taught people from other places to come here and pull the towrope, they would probably somersault like the Monkey King.</p>
<p>"Like last Qingming, when I followed Afu on this water route, Afu tumbled eight times, all sprawled out like a frog..."</p>
<p>Slap—thud!</p>
<p>Before Lao Gui could finish speaking, Lao Qi sprawled out behind him. This made Fifth Uncle, who loved to tease him, laugh so hard on the cargo ship that he bent over forward and backward. Third Master also couldn't help but chuckle a few times. We also laughed, but we were more careful to avoid falling ourselves.</p>
<p>On a dark, sunless day, the fields were filled with a pale gray color. We couldn't see a third pedestrian within a mile or two. Only in the distance, at the foot of the mountain, was a long line of people carrying things, whom we knew were the people returning from Longtou Market. Some of them traveled more than ten miles to attend a market.</p>
<p>"They and we are the same, suffering!"</p>
<p>I murmured. Lao Gui, however, retorted with a lecture:</p>
<p>"Who isn't the same? It's all for food, bastard. Those who have money treat us like cattle and horses. They make you pull until it's dark all year round, and you still have to watch their faces to get your wages. Aren't they just two eyes and a nose? Why do we have to pull so hard while they enjoy the blessings? Screw your ancestors, one day, I'll show you..."</p>
<p>"Slap—thud—" There was an even louder sound, and Lao Qi fell again. This time, we didn't laugh anymore.</p>
<p>Fiction</p>
<h3>Early Winter in Qingyang Port (1)</h3>
<p>— Qiuyuan</p>
<p>One clear early winter afternoon, the sky was high, filled with ever-changing white clouds, and the soft, weak sunlight shone into a relatively tidy apartment room, onto a colorful painting of an F-location scene hanging in the room, onto a bright-eyed, clean-toothed, lively and graceful portrait of a young girl, and onto a single bed covered with a yellow blanket. The surroundings were quiet. Yu Zhuomin, having finished lunch at Anleju, returned to his room dejectedly, washed his hands and face, picked up a cigarette, lit it, watched the wisps of curling green smoke, the photograph made brighter by the sunlight, the light watercolor painting, and looked out at the clear sky and the connected houses, and couldn't help but utter a solitary monologue that no one could hear.</p>
<p>— With such good weather, what else is there to do but go see her?</p>
<p>So he straightened his tie, put on the coat he had brought back from America eight years ago, tilted his hat to the side, and walked out the door with light steps, locking the door casually behind him, and walked to the elevator and the tram stop, as if floating on air.</p>
<p>— Well, today I should find her and spend this clear early winter day properly.</p>
<p>In a crowd of people, he squeezed onto the trolleybus that was already packed to the gills, standing and bumping, and even lightly tossed the half-smoked cigarette out the window onto the road. He didn't know what he was looking at or what he was thinking about. There were so many people on the bus, and they were so mixed, that if it weren't for Qiuhua, Yu Zhuomin would never have taken this trolleybus that he hated so much. He also didn't seem to notice the endless stream of passengers getting on and off, but simply held onto the overhead rattan ring with his left hand, standing blankly, thinking blankly.</p>
<p>— She must be there today, she must be there...</p>
<p>He got off the bus at his destination and approached the school that was not quite a school, and asked the fat and extremely old gatekeeper with some whiskers. Before he could finish speaking, the gatekeeper, who otherwise looked like a wealthy official, had already replied:</p>
<p>— Wang Qiuhua is not here.</p>
<p>Without saying a word, he raised his hand in a gesture of farewell and walked away, again with his head lowered. He took a cigarette from his pocket, lit it, threw the extinguished match forcefully on the ground, and his steps naturally slowed down; he was no longer in the mood to watch the wisps of green smoke he exhaled.</p>
<p>— Where did she go? No, ... maybe she's at home, ... maybe she's coming to my place..., that's right, ...</p>
<p>So Yu Zhuomin's steps lightened again, and he increased his speed towards the tram stop, ignoring the crowd, squeezing on, eager to return to his room immediately.</p>
<p>— Mr. Yu, there's a female guest in your room.</p>
<p>When Zhuomin was walking towards his room with quick steps, the servant reported this message to him.</p>
<p>— Who is it, who is it, who else but her!</p>
<p>He opened the door and found Wang Qiuhua indeed writing at the desk.</p>

<p>Old Xiang: Anyway, we can only wait to die in the countryside. Relying on these disaster relief officials is not a long-term solution!</p>
<p>A Qiao: Then, Brother Xiang, where do you think we should go?</p>
<p>Old Xiang: We have a relative, an older brother, who works in a factory in Shanghai. I think we can go to him together and ask him to help us recommend us to do some odd jobs there. It shouldn't be too difficult.</p>
<p>A Qiao: Lao Wu and the others have already squeezed over there.</p>
<p>Old Xiang: That's right, let's squeeze in there too, and see what the accounting is like.</p>
<p>(Sound of people clamoring, accompanied by children crying!)</p>
<p>Relief Official: (Loudly) Hey, those who have received the biscuit tickets, line up one by one and sit down. The supplies will be distributed to you immediately.</p>
<p>Lao Wu: Sir, we are really starving. If you're going to distribute them, please distribute them immediately!</p>
<p>Wang Da Niang: Isn't it the same whether it's distributed early or late? Don't wait for the time!</p>
<p>Xiao Lu: (Shouting) Lao Wu, come and sit here! Stop meddling!</p>
<p>A Qiao: That's right, come over here! People are fed, how would they know we are hungry!</p>
<p>Relief Official: Less small talk, little girl! We're fed? I don't think you look hungry either! If you were hungry, would you have the strength to talk like that?</p>
<p>Xiao Lu: Okay, okay! You are merciful people, we are pitiful people, stop quarreling.</p>

<h3>Casual Talk on "Parents and Children"</h3>
<p>— Lonely Song</p>
<p>The Cultural Company's "Parents and Children" premiered at the Jin Cheng Theater on Saturday. After the film's premiere, the female lead, Ms. Qiu Xia, and the child star, Ms. Hu Rongrong (Xiao Ming), took to the stage to perform songs and dances. Ms. Qiu Xia is a leader in China's singing and dancing circles, and her talent has long been praised by the entire nation. This time, she exceptionally performed the latest 1936 dance, "Spring Dream Dance," on stage. The beauty of her dance moves, the charm of her singing and dancing, and the splendor of her costume reached the peak of perfection. Her performance, with both singing and dancing, was truly unprecedented. The rising child star, Hu Rongrong, made a stunning debut. Her performance of the "Foreign Doll Dance" on stage was innocent and lively, as adorable as Shirley Temple. The whole audience applauded thunderously, and the audience couldn't help but praise and exclaim, "A dance to behold!"</p>
<p>Among the songs in "Parents and Children," the "Expedition Song" sung by the male and female students of the National Conservatory of Music is the most magnificent. The theme song "Parents and Children," sung by Ms. Qiu Xia, features a deeply moving and skillful singing voice. Without basic training, one could not reach such a beautiful state. The Kunqu opera excerpt "Fisherman's Tears" sung by Ms. Ying is quite beautiful in melody, a rare tune among sound film songs, evoking a great sense of longing.</p>
<p>The structure and interweaving of the entire film "Parents and Children" constitute a new style of composition. After watching this film, emotions move and transform, like watching ten films with different flavors. It is truly the most novel and interesting film of the year.</p>
<h3>Review of Yi Hua's Lineup (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Songzi</p>
<p>A Flower</p>
<p>Xu Su's debut work "A Flower" is a tragedy with an extremely tortuous story. It is set against the background of a song and dance troupe, telling the tragic experiences of a lonely singer, who pursues life amidst hardship, and portraying the coldness of society and the meanness of human nature. The plot is filled with sorrow and extravagance, and it is realistically vivid. Xu Suling has always been known in the literary world for his delicate style. He has a deep understanding of film art. This "A Flower" was created after several considerations. It is said that this sentimental and realistic story will be performed with an extremely precise and delicate style, so that the audience will have a deep impression after watching it.</p>
<p>Little Tiger</p>
<p>Yue Feng's new work after "The Night of the Wedding Candles," "Big Tiger," is a very serious and realistic social problem drama. The play tells the story of a promising young man who, due to the coercion of life, is forced to become a bandit but is eventually arrested. The playwright is appealing on behalf of the miserable orphans and children who take risks because of the pressure of life. At the same time, he is awakening people of insight to consider how to promote public education and settle the future masters of the world who have lost their foundation, for the sake of the survival of the nation and the peace of society.</p>
<p>In addition to this serious purpose, the play also depicts how deeply and painstakingly parents love their children, hoping for their success, but the result is that they harm their children by spoiling them too much. Yue Feng used his unique directing skills in "The Fugitive" and "The Night of the Wedding Candles" and achieved success. This film will continue the past style and be handled with a humorous tone. He believes that it will definitely achieve even greater success.</p>
<h3>Silver Screen Jottings</h3>
<p>Mr. Huang Tianshi's trip to Nanjing is said to be "very good." It is expected that he will have a great career to unfold soon. He is currently residing in a house.</p>
<p>The talk about the Nanjing China Stage Association coming to Shanghai to perform plays started with a burst of enthusiasm, then turned cold, and now it's cold and hot again. According to the latest news, Tang Huaiqiu, Hong Shen, Ying Yunwei, Ma Xiangyan, and the other four are now heading to various theaters in Shanghai to connect.</p>
<p>After Tie Gen published the news that Xu Lai was using the condition of paying Xu Gongxin's 2,000 yuan for China's second sound detective film, "Diamond," Xu Xinfu and Zhang Shichuan were very unhappy, and Zhang Shichuan even flew into a rage.</p>
<p>It has been more than half a month since Mr. Xiang Liang announced his "plan." Mr. Xiang said that he would let us see "Red Light in the Dark" and other plays in about a month. I don't know what the follow-up is now?</p>
<p>"Theater seniors" naturally have the "methods" of "theater seniors," but the date of one is very fast. I remember the date of "the ticket" clearly.</p>
<h3>A Bundle of Tianyi Silver News</h3>
<p>— Bai Yun</p>
<p>Tianyi's new sound film "Two Brothers" will be screened at the Jin Cheng Theater in this city after "Parents and Children."</p>
<p>Lu Lixia is the best actress in Chinese acting, and "Two Brothers" is Lu's only posthumous work, so the premiere of the film is bound to be anticipated by all.</p>
<p>Wang Cilong's success in "Two Brothers" is Lu Lixia's success.</p>
<p>Tianyi's sound film "Flowers and Grasses" has now completed more than two-sixths of its filming.</p>
<p>"Flowers and Grasses" plans to shoot a court scene. In order to make it realistic, assistant director Leng Bo, cameraman Shen Yongshi, set designer Zheng Weiming, stage manager Shen Yalun, and others went to the Special Zone One and Special Zone Two courts yesterday to conduct on-site visits for reference.</p>
<p>The reason why the filming of "Flowers and Grasses" is so slow is that the rehearsals take too much time.</p>
