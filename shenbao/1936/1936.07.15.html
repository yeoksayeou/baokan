<p>時評</p>
<h3>二中全會閉幕</h3>
<p>— 高</p>
<p>五屆二中全會。經三次大會後。已於昨日宣告閉幕。對於當前重要各案。大致均已討論竣事。其最堪注意之决議事項。如組織國防會議。如撤鉗西南兩機關。如更動粤省綏靖主任。皆吾人所認為不易措置之問題。而能於適宜限度之內。顧慮周詳。面面俱到。則斯决全會之結果。不可謂非有相當之成功矣。</p>
<p>方全會開幕伊始。吾人所鰓鰓置慮者。卽為兩粤問題之難於應付。以兩粤所揭櫫口號為促進禦侮。中央之先决步驟為統一軍令。而人民唯一蘄求則為消弭內戰。如此各具懸解。雖於救亡大計。並無相悖之趣。而在實行方面。顯呈渙分之局。兩粤旣藉抗敵名義。演成單獨行動之事實。中央為謀保持威信。難免不施相當之制裁。一至意氣相失。則千戈以興。故當時吾人殫智竭慮。唯冀當局以最大之容忍。謀合作之推進。今幸大會諸公之努力。得有如斯之結果。以組織國防會議為容納兩粤軍人意見之初步。以撤消西南兩機關為統一事權之先聲。以更調粤省綏靖主任為顧全中央之威信。同時對於李宗仁白崇禧等。均能優予位置。使維現狀。卽在免職之陳濟棠。亦復以國防會議委員一席相畀。不令難堪。藉以泯除主觀之意氣。促成精誠之團結。如此穩妥之布置。宜為各方所共諒。而吾人匝月來瀰漫心頭之惶怖。亦極盼能得翕然消釋之一日也。</p>
<p>共决關於禦侮大計。亦吾人對全會所殷殷翹企之一端。自張外長在全會席上發表半年來之外交經過。及蔣委員長報告救亡禦侮之步驟。皆認現時外交途徑。尙未達到最後關頭。蔣氏並明白顯示其所能容忍之限度。及其不能容忍之時間。足徵中央對於禦侮大計。未嘗不在縝密策劃之中。今後統一局面形成。國防會議開始。對於整個外交之調整。必能以集中之力量。為充實之後盾。觀於國防會員中所包孕之人物。非方面之重寄。卽干城之上選。誠應如何底厲身手。輸寫心腹。以共謀沉著統籌之步調。備非常必要之應付。民族存亡之樞紐。已臨到最嚴重之階段。全國上下可。不懍乎勉旃。</p>

<h3>中央紀念週　蔣委員報告統一救亡</h3>
<p>一、外交之根本全在內政、故內政之統一、乃對外禦侮之要道、</p>
<p>二、中央對兩廣異動、始終以寬大為懷之精神、用政治途徑與和平方法解决一切、</p>
<p>三、政令軍令之統一、為對外之根本要件、</p>
<p>四、中央决不能因外患之嚴重、而放棄內亂之平定、</p>
<p>五、解决內政問題情理不能不兼顧、但是非順逆亦不可不分明、</p>
<p>六、革命政府自始至終决心在內外夾攻之中奮鬥到底、</p>
<p>（南京）（續昨）自從「九一八」以來中央一貫的方針、就是「安內攘外」四個字、認定內不能安、不僅外不能攘而且連「外交」二字也談不起來、由此可知此次全體會議所討論的要案雖然包含內政外交兩方面的問題、實際上只是一個內政問題、兄弟向來就認定外交的根本、全在內政、只要內政問題能够得到妥善的解决、外交問題自然可以得到圓滿的結果、大家要曉得果眞我們的內政能够統一、國基能够穩定、世界上無論那一個强大的國家、都要對我們發生敬畏、我們只要眞正統一、就沒有那個敢做我們中國的敵人、所以此次會議所討論的事情、應該特別着重於解决內政問題、來穩定國家的基礎、實現我們三民主義、以期完成革命建國的工作、講到內政、現在無論中央與地方、都是由本黨的同志負責任、所以一切內政上的不安定不統一、都是本黨同志不能團結一致甚至鬧起糾紛的結果、决不能歸咎於一般愛國家的全體國民、現在我們要使內政能够統一安定、必先要解决黨內的糾紛、要解决這個糾紛、當然應該照黨紀國法來處理一切、不過本黨的革命精神、是以「忠、孝、仁、愛、信、義、和、平、」八德為基礎、無論對內對外任何問題、向來都是以「信義和平」的精神、來謀妥善的解决、而對內尤為緊要、從前陳烱明雖然在廣州叛變、以大砲機關槍圍攻總統府、要制總理的死命、然而總理當時仍舊用仁愛的精神寬容他、最後只要陳炯明能悔過自新、卽可不咎旣往、總理這種偉大的精神、實在是我們全黨同志革命的模範、現在大家都很關心兩廣異動的問題、這件事如果純就國家的法律紀綱而言、當然沒有放任容忍的餘地、但是中央方面始終盡量寬容、以信義和平為基礎、始終不放棄政治的途徑、與和平的方法來解决、也就是以總理寬大為懷的精神、做我們處理異動的基礎、現在兩廣幾位負軍事責任的同志、有一個口號說、「在抗日的旗幟之下、方能統一軍令、」這是他們舉一千八百七十一年普法戰後德意志的統一來作例子、說是先要打勝了外國、然後方能完成統一、這個口號和這種說法、他們自己當然以為很有理由、那裏曉得事實上是大錯特錯、我們祗就普法戰爭前後德意志統一的經過事實而論、也可以知道德國、是以一八三四年十七邦的關稅同盟為契機、由于工業革命與畢斯麥苦辛努力的結果、雖然在國家的搆成上、為許多的聯邦、而實際上在對法作戰之先、早已逐步完成政令、尤其是軍令的統一、惟其先能統一政令軍令、所以纔能戰勝法國、並不是戰勝法國而後來統一政令軍令、由此可知軍令政令的統一、是對外抗爭的根本要件、軍令政令不統一、絕對不能對外、兩廣幾位軍事當局、因為不懂這個道理、同時對於國家現實的環境、世界的形勢、完全沒有澈底研究明白、對於我們革命的立塲、也沒有深切瞭解、所以做了很多錯誤的舉措、造出現在這個亂子、他們不自顧惜革命的歷史、固屬很可痛心、可是本黨和國家、因此受了很大的影響、而我們革命策源地的兩廣幾千萬同胞，尤其身受無限的痛苦、現在他們異動還不到兩個月、兩廣已經民不聊生、地方軍人、如此輕舉妄動、貽患國家、這是我們全黨同志、尤其是我個人在中央主持軍事的、更不能不負責自反、兄弟自己誠信未孚、使國家和民眾在憂患悲痛之中、又加上一層的危疑震蕩、撫躬自問、實在覺得非常歉仄和悲痛、現在事實旣已演至如此、我們一方面當然要始終以信義和平為基礎、本着總理寬大為懷的精神、用盡和平的政治的手段、希望兩廣軍事當局、能改過自新、能够使時局重見安定、國家有力量可以對外、但是另一方面、我們也要有整飭紀綱、維持統一的决心和勇氣、負起責任來弭亂定變、决不能因外患之嚴重、而放棄平定內亂之工作、决不可因為顧慮外患之壓迫、就聽少數地方軍人破壞紀律、自由行動、什麼事都馬馬虎虎遷就了事、大家要曉得、就革命的方略來說、正唯有外敵的壓迫、中央更不得不先澈底肅淸內亂、否則一般漢奸匪徒、更要挾寇自重、國家更無安定復興之期、當此外患嚴重的時候、如果有挾寇自重的漢奸匪徒、中央更應該不顧一切、澈底澄淸、以竟安內之全功、而固攘外之根本、如果瞻前顧後、畏首畏尾、顧忌外力之牽制與干涉、因而不敢整理內政、則我們决沒有方法完成建國禦侮的工作、我們也就再不能講革命、我們要革命、就不能怕外患、如果我們革命黨怕帝國主義者的壓迫、那就根本不能革命、例如十五年、在我們廣州肘腋之下、到處都有帝國主義者的力量、如果我們要瞻前顧後、還能出師北伐嗎、我們革命軍自誓師北伐以來、就决心在內外夾攻之中、與一切軍閥與挾寇自重之赤匪漢奸、一切沒有國家觀念的反革命分子、奮鬥到底、這種革命軍的精神、無論何時何地、都是一貫的有充分的表現、現在我們對於內政問題之所以要用和平的政治的方法來解决、絕對不是因為顧忌外患、怕受內外夾攻的危險、而完全是為着同志問歷史感情的關係、與團結精神集中力量的關係、換一句話說、就是為着愛惜國家的力量、保持內部的完整、要求整個的覺悟和團結、使將來大家從此以後、能和衷共濟、共同一致、來完成抵禦外侮復興國家的遠大事業起見、所以不能不以總理包容一切的精神為精神、儘量的用和平方法來解决、以吿慰我們總理與已死同志在天之靈、最近中央各同志、大家對于解决內政問題的方法、當然人同此心、心同此理、都是始終要本信義和平包容一切的精神、用和平的政治方法來處理一切紛亂、但大家要知道、凡是一個國家、要獨立存在于世界、必須保持精神上立國的要件、和統一國內力量的紀綱、如果精神不整肅、紀律不確立、國家便成為無組織無生命的狀態、簡言之、卽不成為一個國家、不拘什麽時候、不拘什麽國家、都會要來侵略壓迫我們、更不當我們中國人是一個有獨立人格的國民、都要當我們中國人是個亡國奴、如果我們只怕外患、不顧紀綱使立國失其精神、那末無論國家怎麼大、人民怎麽多、最後一定要亡國、所以我們處理內政問題、情與理當然要兼顧、而國法紀綱、也不能完全放棄、所以情理之中、一定同時要辨是非、明順逆、如果是非不辨、順逆不明、則紀綱不振、國家亦必隨之而亡、所以現在我們解决內政問題、歷史威情不能不顧、是非順逆允不可不明、希望中央各位同志、在全體會議中、本信義和平的精神、與情理兼顧之原則、研究一個解决內政問題的妥善辦法、總要使我們國家永絕背離分裂的根株、達到眞實澈底的統一、來救國家的危亡、這就是兄弟對於國事的一點意見和威想、特地向中央全體同志傾城貢獻、藉作各位在開會時共同討論的參考、（十三日中央社電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）巴黎迴聲報駐倫敦訪員來電稱、按之南斯拉夫京城傳來消息、德奧兩國頃所成立之恊定、附有秘密條欵一項、規定奧國哈布斯堡舊皇室復辟一事、應延至三年之後、始可實行云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>報紙言論　德意聲氣相應</h3>
<p>（柏林）德奧兩國協定成立之後、此問各報、異口同聲、加以稱道、謂係德國外交之勝利、其在國際上卽將發生反響、自屬意料中事、國社黨機關報「攻擊」報載稱、「此項恊定乃係對付蘇俄之一種工具、而羅迦諾會議之命運、亦從此决定矣、」政界人士則謂、當今國際問題錯綜複雜、欲圖解決法、莫善於關係各國直接締結雙方互不侵犯公約、此於德奧兩國頃所成立之協定、又可獲一明證矣、外交部人士聲明德奧恊定、並無組織新集團之意義、而意奧匃三國前於一九三四年及本年三月間所簽訂之協定、仍當繼續生效、今後奧國政策、自當一仍舊貫、至於德國亦當繼績努力、務與毘隣各國樹立友好關係云云、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）德奧兩國恊定成立之後、、此間講壇報頃加以論列、略謂此項協定、實乃在「國聯會範疇之外」改造歐洲之先聲、而此項改造事業、當以國際生活之新原則為之依據、此新原則、則與民治理想大異其趨者也、法西斯勞工報載稱、「德意兩國需要相同、其民族旣均富有朝氣、其政治機構亦屬新颕而篤實、其對於維持歐洲和平之事業、更復利害相同、今者兩國積極合作之新時代、行常開始、各國凡欲取得德奧兩國之合作者、首當拋棄其與他國所締結之盟的庶幾可也」云云、接該報所稱之盟的、係指地中海沿岸諸國所成立之互助協定、暨法國與歐洲若干小國所訂立之條約而言、就該報之意、前者係為反抗意國之計、而後者則係反抗德國之工具也、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>南斯拉夫京城　德奧兩國協定成立之後、此間眞理報頃加以評論、略云、「歐洲各國縱橫捭闔、結為集團、此與一九一四年之情形初無殊異、但今茲德奧意三國同盟、較之一九一四年之三國同盟尤為强大、此則不同之點耳」云云、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（柏林）德奧兩國恊定成立之後、捷克公使梅思宜頃已奉召返國、此間政界若干人士聲稱、德捷兩國或有締結雙方互不侵略公約之可能、梅氏返國、或與此事有關亦未可必、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>意德參謀部　締結軍事恊定　羅馬談判在進行中　用以抵銷意法恊定</h3>
<p>（巴黎）名記者塔布衣夫人、頃在事業報發表羅馬消息一則、據稱、德國軍事團已于數日之前、行抵羅馬、俾與意國參謀部人員進行談話、幷成立協定、關于此層、半官界人士以為法國陸軍參謀　甘茂林將軍、前于去年一月七日法意兩國羅馬協定成立之後、曾在羅馬與意國參謀部人員簽訂軍事協定、茲意國已與德國相接近、乃欲與該國參謀部成立同樣協定、用以抵銷法意兩國原有之軍事協定云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>羅迦諾會議　意國拒不參加　英法比進行接洽　會議將無期展緩</h3>

<p>（倫敦）自德奧兩國成立協定、意國對於羅迦諾會議拒不參加之後、比國政府正與英法兩國進行談判、準備展期舉行此項會議、頃由外交界人士、加以證實、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）議於七月二十二日舉行之羅迦諾列强會議、現益有展緩之可能、或將無期展緩、蓋最近外交發展所引起之新局勢、關於意國對意德參與該會議一節所抱之態度、衆皆認為不得不重加考慮也、法國之拒絕德國麥與該會議初步討論、或將由尋常外交途經之談話打銷之、俾羅迦諾列强會議第一次正式開會時有五國出席、（十四日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）擬在比京舉行之羅迦諾會議、或將因奧德協定之故、展期至七月二十二日開會、現悉關於邀請德國與會一節、英國之主張以為該會議僅與羅迦諾公約之列强有關、德國旣佔據萊茵地、則不復為有關國之一、此項主張能否成立、須視英比法三國目下對該會議前途所作外交上交換意見之結果而定（十四日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）關於羅迦諾會議開會日期一層、此間消息靈通人士頃聲稱、意國對於此項會議旣已拒絕參加、原定日期、（本月二十二日）或將展緩、亦未可知、惟外相艾登刻在假期中、常於本星期三銷假視事、屆時對於會議應有展緩問題、方能有所决定、據政界與國會人士之意見、羅迦諾會議若果展期舉行、則其眞正原因不外下開兩項、（一）意德兩國旣不參加、則參加會議者自必限於英法比三國、此非英國所願也、（二）羅迦諾公約各簽字國前於本年三月間舉行第一次會議時、曾經成立協定、規定如德國始終毫不讓步、則當由英意兩國永久擔保法比兩國邊界之安全、今若遽開會議、法比兩國代表團、勢將提及前項協定、此又英國所不願聞者也、逆料英國政府今後所當遵行者、厥有兩策、卽（一）靜待意國改變態度、（二）設法使英法德意比五國成立諒解、此在政界人士則多贊成第二策、以為此時立卽着手處理歐洲各種問題、較為得計、若俟德奧兩國協定眞正實施之後、恐將噬臍莫及矣、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>蘭谿因為有衢港（此處稱江河為港）和婺港、在城外匯流成蘭港、下流直入錢塘江、當浙贛鐵路未成以前、它是麗水衢州等縣·以及閩贛兩省、北上滬杭必經的航路、向來車有「七省通衢」的盛名、握住浙東山地區商業的核心、城區聚集有各地商帮、市面很繁榮熱鬧、一般人民的生活、也比較的優裕、自杭江路築成、更進而浙贛通車、商業重心、便漸有分落他處的趨勢、扼着杭江路中點的金華、它原是蘭谿的近水樓臺、兩靜觀間還築上一條支路、使金華得一躍而佔陸路交通的上風、舊有所謂「小小金華府大大蘭谿縣」的諺語、現在却有些改變了、</p>
<p>蘭谿和金華、脈絡聯貫、習俗相因、堪稱「姊妹縣」、譬如說吧、世人但知金華的火腿鮮美、却不知養豬的多在蘭谿、蘭谿精棗很甜很暢銷、但出棗地又遠在金華、蘭谿別饒情趣的茶樓首先特開「茶娘」之風不甘落後的金華茶園也已爭聘花枝招展的歌女、從前做過金華府的官府還想再做蘭谿縣的縣令、反之、做過蘭谿縣的、又想調升金華府、前者是摸着荷包轉念頭、後者是捧着紅頂、想就近高上一步、目前雖廢府為縣、取銷金華府治、可是蘭谿却又駐上一品督察專員兼實騐縣縣長的要員、所負時代政治的使命、比以前的府官還要大得多、而且「天下事無巧不成雙」、現任金華縣的縣長、恰巧又是蘭谿縣府的優秀屬員、提升過雲的、無怪這兩「姊妹縣」的政治效能、比旁處有特殊進展的顯示、</p>
<p>蘭谿在交通重心、未曾轉移他處以前、每晚密集港灣的船隻、常常遮避了江心、就在五年前、轉運公司還很發達、滬杭各大米行、派人來此買米的水客、通常多至五六十人、現在許多轉運公司、旣多無形關門、卽水客常用駐蘭的、也不過數人而已、關谿舊日的大富翁、差不多全是火腿藥材兩業中人、目前火腿受了江北火腿公司的影響、藥材業更因西藥的日漸盛行、買架鹿茸、稱點洋參的人、更已寥若晨星、因此這兩項營業、也都患了不起之症、農村經濟的疲敝、更有江河日下之勢、一般平民和貧農、送進當舖裏去當的東西、由十月死期、展至二十四月、可是都無人去贖、展期並不是當舖的寬厚為懷、實際還是消納典當衣物的佔衣店、不曾遇過「腰纏十萬貫」的顧客、這其中主要的原因、者是受了「一二八滬戰」·「杭江路通車」·「二十三年旱災」的三大影響、去秋以來、因穀價稍漲、特別是桐油的漲價、對於產米產油的農村、確已多少得到滋潤之益、假如穀價每石能常維持三四元的價格、那麼、今夏已漸有復甦氣象的蘭谿市面、還不難走上小康狀態的繁菪路上去、</p>
<p>蘭谿實騐縣縣長胡次威、他原是中央政治學樣的幹部敎職員、他之所以被調來此當縣長、還附帶着作育實騐政治人才的任務、凡中政校畢業的學員、所學與縣區行政性質相近的、都要先到這裏實習、（大槪兩月）然後才委派他實際工作、實騐縣府旣負有這種使命、對於地方政治設施、格外注意、想使它進步成為一個合理化的模範縣、這是不用說的、</p>
<p>胡氏以一書生、離校而任縣長、他曾雷厲風行的做了幾件事、使民衆發生了一番畏懼之心、蘭谿水陸交通發達、五方雜處、人民染有紅丸毒癖的、為數不少、每年買毒丸的漏巵、統計不下數十萬元、政府雖有禁絕之令、但案犯歸法院辦理、有錢的罰欵一千或八百、以充該院經費、無錢的更不便長久禁閉、讓他白吃口糧、結果反變本加厲、毫無成績可言、至民國二十三年、毒犯劃歸縣府辦理、胡氏便從嚴辦入手、先後槍决毒犯十七八人、中有一個八十三歲的老太婆、也因販毒而葬送了老命、大家始知法無倖逭、相存戒心、不但販毒吸毒的案子、漸已絕跡、就是互有連帶關係的小偷、也不知往那裏去了、</p>
<p>這裏還有一種地痞潛勢力、也是半公開的秘密組織、任意移花接木、妄訂罰欵條例、大敲商民的竹竿、外來商民吃了他的虧、所謂「惡龍難鬥地頭蛇、」也只好像啞子吃黃連、有苦說不出、胡氏探知底蘊、一聲不響、設計捉住他們的四五領袖、解送杭州、至今還在那裏睏水開汀、這樣一來、自然又博得商民的一番采聲、</p>
<p>記者從金華赴抵蘭谿的那天、正遇傾盆大雨、有道呌「魚躍門」的城門、都平白地被水淹了一尺深、在一個路人　集避雨的處所、無意中和老百姓談到這位實騐縣長的政情、老百姓除恭維他能幹外、有說他過於嚴厲的、假若老百姓欠糧欠欵、不論地主貧農、馬上就有提槍的人、來追他到縣府去住不出錢的房子、所以以前每年只收五六成的糧賦、這縣長近年能收十足成、講此話的人、最後還伸舌作勢、以補語氣之不足、本來自古所稱善政、大槪法令人情、都應該兼籌並顧的、各地徵收田賦、只要不是苛捐雜稅、而能取之於民、復用之於民、當然無可鮆議、但對於歷經天災人禍、種種剝削的赤貧農民、為避免求蛋殺鵝的損失、酌予寬容、未始不是一椿培養民氣、情不得已的辦法呵、</p>
<p>赴縣府拜訪胡縣長、胡氏出見後、除一般普通談話外、他還談了幾點做官後的感想、有一點是値得注意的、他說、老百姓本來很好、但官府打失威信、太對不住了他、所謂「水能載舟、亦能覆舟」、前途却很危險、前次蘭谿大旱、縣府籌組貸糧合作社以資救濟、貸者不要利息、到秋收後又還、但災民者像驚弓之鳥、寗願挨餓、而不願輕於就食、最後臨到絕糧的生死關頭才漸次有來借糧的、可是還有「支着給縣府賺利」的話語、後來果有不取利息事實縣府才把信用挽回、如此貸糧救災、還不易取得民衆的信仰、若果需要較大的民力、那不是更將發生困難麼、胡氏所言、誠屬事衩、譬如浙江前幾年、曾辦過一次土地呈報、用去經費四百萬元、蘭谿一縣、就被派用十萬元、但呈報毫無結果、後來在事實上、需要再辦淸查、觸着民衆的瘡疤、當然要有反感、又如近年徵用民地民田、修築公路鐵路、事先都說要給價的、然實際還是一句空話、以故此次各縣風起雲湧、徵勸航空祝壽的捐欵、黃明的縣長、愼重將事、這是很對的、因為中國處此國難嚴重期間、一方面對於物質建設、國防建設、固然是一種非常的急務、但他方面培養民力、培養民心、也同樣是根本的要圖、倘若根本要圖的基礎、未曾建築堅固、那麼、其他一切的物質建議、當然也不易安如磐石的、</p>
<p>蘭谿山地多、平地少、耕地因之不足、平均每人口、僅得地二畝、生活自感不足、平均利用已達百分之九十九、擴充耕地、已極少希望、且土地分配、據一般觀察、佃農占農民總數百分之八十、地權很有日曾任集中於少數人的趨勢、該縣自改制實騐、於整理治安以後、卽從事於土地之淸查、對於改良農事、整理耕地、扶植自耕農、而欲使土地利用經濟、並提高其生產力各問題、該縣府都已注意硏究之矣、</p>

<h3>本年第一季　上海工商業異動報告　中國徵信百主主編（上海工商業概況之卅二）</h3>
<p>本年為首三月，上海工商業之興替概況，與去年同期相較，據本所調查統計所得，大體可列表如次：</p>
<p>按前表觀察，二十五年第一季之各項異動數字，皆較二十四年同期為大，原因有二：一為本年之工商業異動本身確較去年為甚，一為本所調查工作及材料蒐集工作更較欄之意義。按擴充與收縮係指一企業之營業範圍增減而言，例如資本之增加，分號之設立等即屬於擴充，機車之停工，股本之拆出等，即屬於收縮，倘　是項異動而兼業主或字號之更變者，則歸入改組項下。在二十四年份本所統計，尚未將該兩項異動特別分出，故缺乏其數字，非去年同期，無該項變動也。（未完）</p>

<h3>暑期學生國貨運動的三大力量</h3>
<p>— 姚明然</p>
<p>（一）自省力　曾子說：「吾日三省吾身，」自省的確能夠悔悟，知過，是養成良好習慣的基礎，鄙人用這國貨紙張來寫稿，已有三年，起先也用非國貨的舶來品，一旦自省，知道不是道理，隨即改用國紙，可見任何事情，只須自省，便不成問題，學生是社會的中堅份子，在這國難日深的今日，再不自己反省過來，改用國貨，那麽還有什麽話可說呢？我想無論大，中，小，小學生，都應有這樣一個觀念，用徏的力，傑改用非國貨的歧途，是目下提倡暑期學生國貨運動中間，一件根本解決的所謂革心運動，才不會蹈前車之轍。</p>
<p>（二）連鎖力　光是自省力，是只做到個人運用國貨的第一階段，好在學生處的是初步團體生活，我想早夕相晤的朋友，用連鎖的方法羣策羣力的負起責任來，互相規勸服用國貨，一面由學校通知家長，共同做起，不無不些效力，國灰目的是在乎學生用國貨，學生不是利令智昏的商人，容易團結一致，拒用外貨，不過這一點可尊貴的熱血，沒有校長家長的陪親是不能久持的，要做到這一步，必須要學生，家長，校長，三痊一體的連鎖力，才會奏效呢！</p>
<p>（三）編制力　上面已經說過，必須三位一體的力，才能達這學生用國貨的力，但是不熱心的去舉行，有什麽用呢？不是等於泡影嗎？所以編制力的分配，是完成此目的大本營，吾希望不做則已，做則必須有始有終的精神，不屈不撓的毅力，來做出一些成績，模範來昭示不用國貨的學生，吾們不用空話，只講若幹，老實說，要做到這步重大的責任，必須請暑期學生國貨運動會，協同教育局，共同辦理，希望以後能不以暑期為限，最好能像功課一樣的有分數上下，才能使學生醒悟，此一步不能實行，吾想必無效果！</p>
<p>貢獻話</p>
<h3>送南洋商業考察團</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>南洋商業考察團，在中華工業國外貿易協會領導之下，將於明日放長途萬里，壯哉此行，記者於請君出發之時，敬本贈言之意，聊表貢獻之忱。</p>
<p>南洋商業考察團諸君，均為經營國貨實業之有力分子，於工業之製造，出口之推銷，具有經驗，本其熱心國貨之素抱，深究南洋貿易之實況，示以國貨之真相，與各廠之內容，携帶樣品三百餘箱，作大規模之宣傳，與極誠意之聯絡，其影響於國貨之出路，寗可限量。</p>
<p>諸君應甜味贖，對於我國之重要，及日本間諜南洋之急切，我國貨界與南洋僑胞，非有合作奮鬥之決心，以充實對外單鍵之實力，則我國在南洋商業之地位，不久將消滅於無有。諸君此行，應抱定為擴展國貨領域而去，非為尋常酬酢而往，以吾所見此行有三忌，又有四要，三忌者何：</p>
<p>（一）忌無謂之酬酢　考察時間極短，走馬看花，當然不可，非用長時間之訪問，與極精確之調查，決難知其實況，故無謂應酬，應高潮減少或避免。</p>
<p>（二）忌行為之放縱　南洋商業考察團，此為第一次出國，萬目睽睽，觀瞻所繋，行為失檢，不但貽僑胞之口實，且失卻南洋人士之信仰，故一舉一動，應尊重國員地位，即為國家保持聲譽，凡發言談話，均宜就整個立場，不應枝枝節節，各行其是。</p>
<p>（三）忌工作之敷衍　向來考察團之大病，在工作敷衍。考察是地，渲染熱鬧，考察之後，冰水雪解，如各忙於本業，淡然忘之。此種考察，至無價值，故此應行用深刻工夫，澈底辦法，持以終始，運以決心，而後考察以後，時時有聯絡之機會，處處有工作之餘地，一矯前弊為益實巨。</p>
<p>四要者何：</p>
<p>（一）要在南洋巨埠與當地商會設立國貨陳列館，長期陳列送往之國貨樣品，以示僑胞，常供參攷。並推了陳出新，時時更換。</p>
<p>（二）要在南洋巨埠與僑胞聯合設立介紹所，辦理介紹國貨事宜，並負責答復各地僑胞有所諮詢。</p>
<p>（三）要在南洋巨埠與僑胞或商會設立國貨推銷處，或中國國貨公司，使僑胞認識國貨，更覺親切，國貨銷路更見擴大。</p>
<p>（四）要在南洋巨埠設立上海國貨工廠聯營所，集數十家之工廠，請定熟於南洋情形推銷經驗之人，留在南洋主持一切，以通聲氣，而暢銷路。</p>
<p>此行完成南洋商輪，設立南洋銀行，在在謀南洋商業之發展，而予國貨以暢銷之機會。此行關係，實莫與京，也貢一言，以祝諸君之勝利。</p>
<h3>貢獻於學生暑期勸用國貨團</h3>
<p>— 筱石</p>
<p>愛國的學生們，在這火熱的暑天中，接受本市國貨運動聯合會的決議，組織學生暑期勸用國貨團，分赴內地，實行勸導，一面發揮他的愛國精神，一面喚起社會的覺悟，真是價值偉大，意義深遠！怎樣勸用？怎樣指導？會有很詳細的規定，不必吾來贅述，吾所要貢獻於學生諸君的，就是在勸用時應當注意的內個問題。</p>
<p>一，要民衆化：內地民衆，腦筋十分簡單，見聞十分淺近，行動方面，服裝方面，稍有一些奇異，就可引起他們的疑惑。倘然自己身上穿的，手裏用的，有一二種不是國貨，甚或是多數不是國貨，儘你舌辯能言，演說大家，恐怕等你一開口，背後已在批評你口是心非，自己沒有知道愛國，怎配勸人愛國呢？這點重要，如事前沒有注意到，結果就要徒勞無功，甚或竟可留一個極不好的印象。</p>
<p>二，要深入民意：大都會，大市鎮，一切事情，比較易受人注意，我們勸用國貨，要多注意到不識不知的大衆。欲到不識不知的大衆。欲達到這個目的，非深入民意不可，在這火熱的天氣，深入民意，確是十分苦惱，交通既感不便，起居飲食，又多簡陋非有能耐勞苦的習慣，恐不能勝此責任。現在直徑貨已深入民意了，窮鄉僻壤中，隨處可以遇到販賣私貨的小販，我們要杜絕私貨，怎可不追蹤私貨，深入民間呢？</p>
<p>三，不辭勞怨：為社會服務，受勞吃苦，固屬慣常，有時竟會使你無端受怨。我們對大衆講話時，効力的有沒有，真難預料，甚且一不得法，竟會受着當面責難，或者惡言受辱，在不開通的內地，極遭遇到。我們固要留意於平時，即不幸而遇着，亦宜平心靜氣以處之，認為無故受怨，本所意料，如或不能忍受，非計劃失敗，即惹出是非。故諸君外出勸導時，一方面要吃得苦中苦，一方面要有容納閒氣的大肚子。</p>

<h3>紗花　本紗交易太滯　紗市已露軟態　惟本月仍有拉抬跌勢稍平</h3>
<p>紗市趨疲、跌風稍起、良以美棉續跌、人心帶挫、兼之現紗銷塲殊形冷澹、客方因價高而絕無風輪能力、惟一般投機商心思異常狂熱、鑒於海外棉業善良好發、一味挺進、市傳近月有軋空之空氣、惜乎華紗交易太滯、全日成效僅五十包、日紗交易有三百餘包。</p>
<p>遠月跌二元強</p>
<p>標紗前午開盤、以美棉續墮、市場人心帶疲、近跌一元二角、遠跌一元四·五角、市態軟弱、二盤以後、市上傳說紛紜、謂多方準備巨量收貨、且有軋空舉動、八月期驟跳一元關、遠期跟漲一元至六·七角、迨至三收盤、聞現紗銷路岑寂、華紗奇少、人氣轉松、本月雖昂、遠月大跌一元外、結果各月比上日收盤價除本月漲四角、遠期狂跌二元至二元一·四·七角、先後開盤近朋轉弱、拍至九十月期時、先後大孤三品紗本月猛漲三·四元之譜、人心未史激昂、各月均漲六·七角、但入後因紗銷不靈銷萎、結果近月比上午收盤價跌六角至一元、遠漲一角、查賣出德大一千六百包、大孚一千九百五十包、通記一千二百包、恒益五午九百五十包、泰　興三千五百包、賡豐二千二百五址包、興昌一千三百包、長豐二千六百包、潤康四千九百五十包、大昶一千八百包、協成一千一百包、買進聚興一千三百五十包、裕大二千八百包、源大九百包、合興一千五百五十包、豐泰一千四百包、慎記四千九百包、大昌成三千八百五十包、泰昌一千七百三十包、恒昌一千包、大昶　一千包、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<h3>棉商羣起套賣　標花新陳一致下跌</h3>
<p>棉市新陳花一致回跌、氣勢稍挫、蓋以美棉旱區得雨、南方套售續跌十餘磅晉、印棉亦跟落、人心不振、同時現棉需要完全停頓、羣向所中套賣、然多方意態仍挺、以圩陳花擠軋之念、尚未放棄云、</p>
<p>近遠跌半元左右</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、以美棉天降甘霖、南部棉農套賣而跌八至十六磅晉、印棉亦跌一羅比七五、大孤三品本月跌一元二角、市場人氣平庸、買勢減退、本月跌三角半、拍至八月期多頭又來拉提、市象帶緊而勿動、十月陳花得多方之援助、忽跳二角半、八月期復出五十元關外、惟邀月平常　、迨至　收盤、緊於紗市乏力、有一部分獲利多頭了結、陳花狂跌三四角、遠月牽至下滬、結果各月比上日收盤價、陳跌四角至四角半、新花跌四角半至六·八·角、午後開盤、陳花仍疲憊不振、愉新花漲二角、三收盤因大阪三品花市由疲加堅、本月狂跳五角半、八月漲二角半、新花漲五分、結果各月比上午收盤價均漲一角、查賣出裕大三千擔、益康二千五百擔、德大二千擔、通記一萬無序　五百擔、恒益一萬二千擔、明德七千二百擔、森康四千擔、長豐一千六百擔、大昶二千五百擔、長和一千五百擔、興昌一千七百擔、長餘三千七百擔、泰昌二千五百擔、協成二千擔、生源六千擔、買進新昶二午擔、聚興三千擔、裕康一千五百擔、大豐三千擔、源大四千七百擔、合興一萬一千擔、慎昌三千五百擔、瑞大三千五百擔、豐泰二千五百擔、慎記一萬二千五百擔、大昌成八千八百擔、潤康四千擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下</p>

<h3>中部棉區獲得陣雨　美棉因有招領而回跌</h3>

<h3>糧食　新麥旺到標凖市氣松動</h3>

<h3>麵粉暗盤小四五分</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上下午開盤、各月份仍照　限價開拍、愉雙方正式交易不多、而各經紀人之自相互軋、頗傳活絡、前傳之暗盤、形勢逐松、因國外洋麥報價、已因雨而回跌、國內之現粉需要、亦較寂、昜以新麥到旺、各廠均能盡量生産、是以一部分多頭、已不硬擯、近遠期聞已降至三四五分之暗價、此後如國外報價不佳、此種抬面、當可無形消滅云。</p>
<h3>食米高貨行市尚挺</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各幫來源祇到十餘號、貨共二千餘石、本街銷塲本漸見活、詎突遭某料店之倒閉、致有大批現貨出檔、故本街銷路又見呆滯、而包胃南北洋兩幫、亦祇　辦六百餘包、做開早粳及薄稻雖貨到稀、而結果行情呈定中帶軟之局、杜洋尖相仿、陰變元無軒輊、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日下各路到貨十餘號、市上各種去路又轉清淡、白粳新鮮者價回小數分至一角、宿次者交呆、薄稻高挺次疲、白元價形增疋、羊埠尖價短一角左右、其餘各貨價形看波、</p>

<h3>南北貨　同安桂元豐收絕望　荔枝湧到售價亦松</h3>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （方叔俊）</p>
<p>生長在二十世紀裏，生存競爭日劇，强凌弱，衆欺寡，弱小民族似釜中之魚，喪家之犬，處處受强暴者欺壓，故我們此時所需要的，祗有以我們乾凈的頭腦，和更多齷齪的手，發展我們的能力，充實我們的技能。若存「我只吃這碗飯，只穿這件衣」的心理，俯仰寬然有餘，則永為人所宰割，如此生存於世界上徒佔空間一個位置而已；剩此殘軀，庸庸碌碌，與禽獸無異。故「一切的人生可能性是成天秤式的，它可以落到好的一端，也可以落到壞的一端」，你莫再等到全壞的時候才自覺，到那時的生命早已沒有了。</p>
<p>宇宙間任何勞動艱窘之事都不足以為苦；最苦者乃失去主宰自己靈性意志的本能。</p>
<p>惟有「勇敢」才能得到勝利，惟有「奮鬥」才能得到光明，惟有「苦幹」才能完成我們的使命。</p>
<h3>印度西施</h3>
<p>— 闌删</p>
<p>我姑母家隔壁客堂樓上，前月搬進了一份人家，——馬老先生夫婦，和他們的妙齡女公子。沒有多少時候，不知由誰挖空了心思，上了伊一個尊號，呌作「印度西施」！</p>
<p>這稱謂雖有點不倫不類，可也恰如其份。——便是馬姑娘自己，也於微笑中默認了的。——為的是：伊有一臉一身發光的黝黑的肌肉，當和你談話或者在打呵欠時，白如編貝的牙齒，便和黑亮的臉部爭輝，互相掩映，使人見了覺得有炭中着雪之美。更襯以一管挺而直的玉鼻，一雙又圓又大的活溜溜的黑眼睛，一段頑長而苗條約身架，而解放了的胸部却又是顫巍巍的。這光景，就與阿三的太太們幾無二樣。　一九三六年的審美觀念，已經從淺薄的白色之謳歌，進而稱頌起黑色之魅力來了。什麽「黑牡丹」囉，「黑的誘惑」囉，喊個不絕，不是明證？什麽色彩都是虛偽的，惟有黑色纔是眞實的，有力的，動人的色中之王！</p>
<p>印度西施也深明此理，伊對於自己之擁有這一種皮色，威有非常樂意。伊和我的表妹—嫻——很要好，上次就忠告伊說：「如果你希望得到像我一樣的皮膚，最好常到虹口游泳池玩玩，幾個月之後，保你可以成功。——我自己是玩不得的了，生怕太陽晒在我的臉上。晒退了皮，那時候一塊淺色，一塊深色，沒法補救。」可是伊是研究有素的。嫻給伊說得怦怦心動了，前天向我徵詢意見，還要我每個星期六和星期日陪伊去游泳，我說：「你如有意於做印度西施第二，就不妨：但可惜你沒有一管挺而直的鼻子，眼睛也不够圓大，不像樣。」給我這一說，伊也覺悟過來了。</p>
<p>印度西施愛穿玫瑰紅和棗紅的衣料，這樣可以增加伊的魅力。我有一次和伊打玩笑道：「馬姑娘，倘若你着了印度女入的服裝在路上跑，管呌那些阿三們和你攀起起親來呢！」</p>
<p>伊嫣然一笑，罵我也要跟別人一樣愛嚼舌根！——又使我鑑賞一會炭中着雪之美。</p>
<h3>脆梅子擔</h3>
<p>— 朱少飛</p>
<p>夏天，人都有些兒懶洋洋，尤其是午後，坐在屋子裏也有些兒睡意的。據說吃酸味，可以淸醒些，酸味唯有梅子最可口，鄉間在蠶忙的時節，「揀大眠」或則蠶上山「揀考子」逢到夜深人疲倦了，上梅樹摘幾個，拌些兒鹽，吃着就會淸醒了，所以梅子在故鄉（東山）當作解瞌　唯一妙品看待的。</p>
<p>時季交進了夏，村莊裏時可聽到呌賣脆梅子的呌聲。脆梅子擔一頭是隻圓木桶，一頭是隻方格的木盤兒，格子裏大小梅子有上七八種，揀着賣給你臘黃　的梅子襯着一片靑桑葉，一口嚼兩爿，的確怪鬆脆的。</p>
<p>「脆梅子噢…」，一陣陣嘹喨悠長的喊聲，打巷口傳過來，漸漸地喊到了我家門前來，擔子就停在大楡樹蔭下了，跟着抽旱烟，「嗒嗒」　拷着旱烟頭　的烟末屑的聲音，我們孩子們聽着出門來歡喜在擔邊　，賣梅子的是個老頭兒，有着花白的八字鬚，拖着一根頭髮數得淸的小辮兒，人是怪和靄的，有時摸着我們的頭，或則在盤裏揀幾個挺小的酥梅子分給我們孩子吃，給後要我們呌他聲老伯伯，我們眞的呌他聲老伯伯？他就喜開嘴笑啦，沒主顧也會停了好多時才挑着擔走了，這些孩子時對那賣脆梅子的老頭兒的情形，一幕幕地現在我的腦膜呢。</p>
<p>又是聽着喊賣脆梅子聲音的季節了，依舊一陣陣喊聲傳到巷裏來，那個老頭兒已　經死了多年了，現在挑擔喊賣的是他的兒子。</p>
<h3>處世三部曲</h3>
<p>决—深得三昧</p>
<p>圓—社會經驗</p>
<p>方—學業成就</p>
<h3>元明和尙</h3>
<p>— 周賢</p>
<p>元明和尙，是我鄉某寺中的僧衆之一。他的出身，是一位鄰縣的師範學生。會說話，會作詩，更能寫得一丰的北魏好字。在十五年前，不知因何刺激，竟棄家而皈依空門，求着寺裏的老方丈，給剃度。老方丈問明了他的來歷，不敢招留。過了幾天，他的家族，也跟踪找來了。老母稚妻，逼着他回去，他只是不理。老方丈沒法，只得把他收了，取名元明。他是學有根蒂的，所以不上三年，已參透了禪理。所作詩，也充溢着明心見性的禪味。當地的士紳，和他都有唱酬之作。那時，他年僅二十五歲左右。</p>
<p>這麽着又忽忽地過了二年，他的母親妻子，先後謝世了，他回家去料理喪事之後，把一半家產，撥為寺產，一半散給了貧苦的同族。就在那一年，地方上發生了兵亂，大家小戶，都紛紛地避難。元明師徒們，安居不動。三個月後，亂事敉平，避難者回去時，却失了元明的踪跡。一問老方丈，才知某師長與元明，是有同窗之誼的，所以把他帶走了。過了一年，元明曾回寺，而向老方丈叩安了一次。那時，他身衣戎服，帶着四個衛兵，說已被某師長擢為秘書了。此後，便音信杳然，任誰都不知元明的踪跡。</p>
<p>昨天傍晚，我家門口，忽來了一個苦行頭陀，破衲芒鞋，形容憔悴，手持黃簿，說的是替浙西某寺，募化重修佛像。打着稽首，求我佈施。我細加辨認，似曾相識，一加追問，才知他是十年不見的元明。據談，他在軍隊中，混了二年，乘隙逃出，雲遊至浙，遇一高僧，研習若干年，益加澈悟，此次奉師命，下山化綠，重修佛像，一俟募滿三千金，功德圓滿之後，將雲遊川陝秦隴，朝名山古刹，以了却塵世俗綠，從此不再向人世之間討生活，而求其歸束於其師所示之所。</p>
<p>談了一陣我因手頭拮据，僅助了二元。他稽首稱謝而去。臨行時，他說，「三年之後，你或許將往　都一行。若是有綠，屆時或再有一面的機會。」事後，有人說他是騙子，海上最多的是這些兒滑頭僧道。但我覺得這元明和尙，雖非得道高僧，但决不是念秧者。爰走筆誌之。</p>

<p>就在這時，街邊上有兩偭人哈哈大笑。國器心裏卜通一跳，莫非人家是笑我的，這條街上，全是熟人，讓人笑話，倒怪難為情的。於是正着顏色，沉着了脚步，一步一步的走着。走到了每决二人見面的所在，心裏可又有些跳動了，今天見着了他，不知道他是喜容？是怒容，或者像平常一樣，臉上並不帶一點顏色。自然，他喜歡呢，那是表示同情了，生氣呢？那就一切希望，成為幻想。若是像平常一般，也許是沒有接着那封信。到了那地方了，自己更是着慌，連耳朶根子都紅了。那脊染上一陣陣的向外冒着熱汗。心裏估計着，那人一定是來了，自己連頭也不敢抬。可是只管走着，並沒有着到對面有人來，一直把這條巷子，完全都過了。那人也並不見到。彼此全是算準了時候，在一定的時間，走到這地方來的。現在錯遠了這一截路，那也就是過了時候了。也許他己經提前走了過去，也許他今天是不肯再來，那末，自己寫去的那封信，是不會再發生效力了。他立刻在心上加减了一種不可言喻的苦痛，兩手反在身後，低了頭走到學堂裏去。在這個高級小學裏，國器是一位最忠於職務的敎員，準時到校，準時上課，上課的時候，是詳詳細細的同學生去講解。這天不解何故，坐在休息室裏，等着上課的時候，將一枝鉛筆，在一本練習簿上，只管亂塗。左手拐撑住了桌沿，却把手去托了頭。手上雖拿了鉛筆，在練習簿上塗抹，却不知道塗的是些什麽。一個校役，隔了玻璃窗子，向裏面望着問道：眾先生，你今天上午沒有課嗎？國器被他呌着，才猛醒過來，問道：已經搖過上堂鈴了嗎？校役道：總搖過去十分鐘了。這鈴子而且是由窗戶下搖了過去的章先生沒有聽到嗎？國器向窗子外看去，課堂外已沒有了一個學生，自己不覺得笑了起來，拿了桌上一本書，忽忽的就走上課堂去。這一堂本是國文，國器站在講臺上，把書糊了一翻，好想起來是應當敎第幾課。不想翻了七八頁，還找不着要講的所在。還是在座位上的學生，看到先生這樣亂找，有些明白了，因呌這：這一堂上第十五課，題目是愛國之童子。（四八）</p>

<h3>湖上偶書（下）</h3>
<p>— 天虛我生自西湖寄</p>
<p>楊水酸能除痛解熱，解血內釀毒，主治白喉，淸明之柳，則取其嫩，未經長雨，則含有效成分較多，是亦乘時而取之理。蒲艾必乘端節，亦以過此而後，梅雨浸淫，失其效用，古方：每有采集之定時，大抵亦由格物而知。至若端午節禮，每以生鵝及黍角為餽，鵝為當年所生，此時正及長成，以供先生之饌，後生小子之孝敬心也。且有用處，可使守門伺客，並能除草去萍，其糞則為魚糧，其目視人，有如凸鏡，與牛眼適成反比，牛之瞳孔為放大鏡，所見童子，亦為大人，故受其制，鵝之瞳孔為縮小鏡，雖見大人，亦且認為小人，故敢以喙啄之，而行吭作厲聲也。端午綜貓，裏鹹為聘，則以淡食之貓，方喜食鼠，而嗜鹽者，必喜偷嘴，是與東床選壻相同，蓋所聘者，必求其牡，取其聲威能嚇鼠輩，惟求嗣者，始求牝耳。黍角以陳糯為之，一過黃梅，則米必蛀，故乘此際蒸而貯之，用為田中午膳，詩人所謂蒸參炊黍向東畬，卽男耕婦　之實事也。夏畦易病，往往暑濕內蘊，入秋為瘧疾，因取糯米能發與鵝同食，亦為引病外出之劑，並所以防傷寒痢疾之發於秋也，此與春夏之交，引種牛痘，以防天花傳染之理相同，而在曩昔端陽，街頭尙有呌賣節物者，呼為「艾虎兒桃柳苻兒」者，則為婦女揷鬢之需，所以防蜻蜓之類飛上搔頭患耳。至於香囊臂縧之屬，其中必貯樟腦，所以防領袖之間或生蟣蝨，若以大黃裝為佩帶之物，則防傷寒傳染，取陳無揮之三因方惟恐不及汗吐，乃用其下，使能一瀉而愈，是誠所謂續命之荷，各合苻節者矣。故吾嘗思·節令所宜，竟使家家戶，人人不敎而從，無不肯為利已利人之事，習於自然而不覺，亦且不厭其煩，不惜其費，此所謂令，實為命令之全，不知始自何人，能使民信而從如此。若在今日，則人人各有自由之權，旣不能命，又不能令，任何一種運動，欲其普遍風從，安之若素，誠戞戞乎其難之。故予以為改良改善，准不良不　者，始必改之若為善良之風俗習慣，不應視為迷信，完全打倒，似當加意維護，唯恐其失，所謂節禮，亦卽禮義廉恥之禮，入國問禮，卽因其所行之禮，必有深義存焉，子入太廟每年事，亦正自恐其不知禮也，禮失而求諸野，吾於端陽日，適在山鄕，覺此橫霧余烟，有如防空之製障，個使防空有如此舉，則驅除鐵鳥，有何難哉，卽起羣力捕而殲之，一如捕蛇榏虎，亦非不可能也。民可使由之，不可使知之，吾嘗認為此二句者宜在可字斷句，但亦有時仍宜整句讀，以作妙用，例如建塔原為斥堠之用，所以防敵可資望，唯恐民心恐慌，乃假神道設敎，以杜淫惑，今之公路，亦同此意，托為交通游覽之便，殆亦與明修棧道暗渡陳倉之策相同歟？但如無守，則反足以資敵，守云何哉！則我古人本有守望相助之法，今之保甲訓練，其庶幾乎？十年敎訓，志在沼吳，然在當時，必不明言以招吳忌，防民之口，甚於防川，民可使由知而不可使知，其斯之謂乎？</p>

<h3>體力的不濟就是事業的失敗　一個靑年的來信</h3>
<p>西諺云：「有健全的體魄始有健全的事業」</p>
<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>中國人的體格素來是孱弱的，所以一切的創造力，都比不上外人。因為國人死亡率的高，竟被他人戴上了一個「東亞病夫』的頭銜！我呢，因為先天的不足，從小就是多病多痛的，而且不幸又犯了手淫惡習，越犯越弱　以後雖然立志戒絕　然已成了遺精滑洩之病，所以身體蹧塌得衰弱不堪，能够不即時到鬼門關去，這已經是難能可貴了。何敢再得隴望蜀想康健的幸福喲！不過我有種感想，第一最引為痛心的事，就是因體格衰弱的緣故，影響了我事業上的成就。今春吧！我服務的所在，因為節省開支而裁員了。自然我病夫似的夥計早為老闆被裁的目的物了。就此失業。我心靈上的痛苦，眞不能形容了。試想我孱弱的身體，怎經得起過分憂慮嗎？所以不到一月，就覺得頭痛，耳鳴，精神疲乏（較平時增重一半，因平時亦慼精神不佳）食慾不進，弄得骨瘦如柴，三分像人七分像鬼。我的父親着急了，同母親商量，除了多方安慰我，並且將滋補的藥品中西雜進，但是終歸無效。諸位當要明白，我是單傳，恐怕死了之後父親要絕嗣了，所以我治療上從不間斷，直至今春三月（閏三月）由父親的朋友介紹服了『生殖素』之後，才漸漸被牠推動，先期祇覺得精神安適，睡眠舒服，至後食慾也遂漸增進了，精神也加倍旺盛了。同時頭痛，耳鳴，滑精等症，消滅無形。現在肌肉飽滿，每日做十小時的工作。視若無事。父親歡喜到了極點，逢人便說『生殖索』如何如何的靈騐。在端午節我已找到了職業，我的得有今日，論功行賞，不得不推崇『生殖素』的偉大。同時我也不能忘却了「希米脫氏固精片」，因為牠是治愈我遺精滑洩的大功臣。我想和我同病相似的靑年，也不致於少數吧。所以特地寫這封信，祝</p>
<p>你們也同我一樣的幸福。</p>

<h3>治療遺精之釜抵抽薪法</h3>
<p>— 周笑涵醫師</p>
<p>最會致人死命的遺精，講起來會使你怵目驚心。往往一個有為的靑年，因為自凟的結果，致精關鬆弛，精液滑出。卒至神經衰弱症纏綿直到他臨死的一刹那。這樣的慢性自殺，每年不知要多少的生命移殖到陰世！所以最危險的性病，莫過於遺精了。</p>
<p>有的靑年因為被遺精而惹起的頭痛，耳鳴，心悸，目眩，失眠，精神疲勞，面黃肌瘦，一切神經衰弱症，會結夥成羣的襲來，結果生活無力，受到很大的刺激，甚至使心靈上完全變成昏亂，憂急的情緒思想。自然，假若一個親自嘗到神經衰弱病的痛苦，就等於將人生的幸福剝削了。結果有的竟會厭世而自殺了。</p>
<p>最重大的要點，患者應該要認淸，就是遺精雖然是嚴重性，不過它並不是一齣失望的悲劇。祇要你服具有强壯精關補充精液能力的希米脫氏『固精片』就可以得到無上裨益的效果。不但使你的遺精很快痊愈，並且能够恢復你生育的能力，澈底的說一聲：就是你身體內部產生精的性腺，依然可使他完整，所以惟有以希米脫氏的『固精片』來根治遺精，才是一個釜底抽薪的療法。</p>
<h3>運用藥力　使淋菌無由侵入</h3>
<p>— 兪伯符醫師</p>
<p>穩妥之預防及其自療</p>
<p>安然敵淋……色素內服劑卒抵於成</p>
<p>因為感染淋病太容易了的綠故，加之淋病之複雜難愈，使人們感到無限的痛苦與恐怖。因此之故，都想用種種的預防法來杜絕淋菌的竄入，確屬是當務之急。過去的幾種方法，牠的功效，都不能使人信任，共决關於技術的常識問題，亦均不能滿意而放心。</p>
<p>無論何種疾病都是一樣，在今日最進步的醫學下，第一須要講求預防方法，過去的數種預防法，、可以說一聲：都為消極的預防，現在倡妓制度，還沒有較好的辦法來統制改進，所以淋病的傳播紀錄猛進。澈底根本之預防法，實在是切迫而需要了。現在自黃色素製劑的內服藥「安敵淋」問世以來，淋病治療上的新途徑，方然覔得終南捷徑。此為一般曾經服者所推崇。一致認為自療上最簡便有效力之良藥，不過俟淋病感染後再使用此藥，不若在事前預先呑服「安敵淋」數片，較為合算。因為「安敵淋」透膜殺菌之力宏大，所以事先呑服，使淋菌不易竄入，即使竄入，亦不易蕃殖。因「安敵淋」藥力强大，數分鐘之間，盡可剿滅殆盡矣！</p>
<h3>保持男女靑春驚人的成功</h3>
<p>— 劉志民醫師</p>
<p>據歐美的醫學家曾在雜誌登載一文，以為人類的年齡，男子確實可以活到一百六十歲，女子雖較男子易於衰老，但至少也可活到一百二十歲。不論男女，在一百歲而死的人，已經算是短壽了！可是中國人平均祗可活到三十歲，能够享八十歲以上高齡的人，一百個中難得一個。歐美醫學家的所以發這種意見，並非沒有根據，他完全根據醫學的原理，並且作種種的試騐。他之所以斷定人類一百歲以上的壽命，原因就是可以用醫藥的補救使之保持常駐靑春。這並非理想，因為現代科學上的發明，無不憑人類的智慧所促成的。但看奧國生理學家斯丹那氏發明以生殖腺素製劑的「生殖素」之後，男女們得到男用女用「生殖素」滋補力的推動，使一切人體上的細胞逐漸新陳代謝，血液充旺，接濟不會枯竭，因此可保持常駐靑春，面色轉為紅潤，且「生殖素」補力之偉大，可以在極短時間建於全體。常年服此，精神倍旺，體重增加，在女子方面，又可使乳峰豐腴，增加健美。這都是使保持人們靑春的原動力，疾病是不會生了，健康是無問題了，所以確定的說：六十歲以內的人决不是服「生殖素」人們生命的終點！</p>
<p>性病講座</p>
<p>— 詹念曾醫師　姚爾昌博士合編</p>
<p>（診所）四川路北京路轉角中國信託公司二樓　（門診）上午十時至下午六時。星期日休息。</p>
<p>（一）白濁雖愈性促繼來</p>
<p>淋濁過久之後，則身體因消耗過度，勢必呈衰頽現象。如調養不善，則神經衰弱症自必難免。故凡患遺精性促等症，除由手淫而促成之外，則淋病為其主要之原因也。</p>
<p>患者馬君，年近三旬，罹患時發時愈之淋病，已有四年矣。去年春曾一度復發，旋自服「安敵淋」治愈。如是經過半載之久，病竟未發，並得醫師檢騐證明確無淋菌存在。上年冬始遵母命回鄕結婚，但不料洞房之夜，即感性能促弱。馬君大為驚恐，乃亟思治療。今春卜居上海，始來余處求醫，余乃以滋補生殖腺最力之「生殖素」服之，果然病情轉機，性促之病，後竟霍然云，</p>
<p>（二）手淫遺精發育不全</p>
<p>蓋人體發育之健全與吾，無不與將來之康健發生密切之關係。故在發育之時期內，一切攝生之方法，務必使之合乎常規。如在發育尙未達到成熟之時，切不可作自凟行為，不然危險堪虞也。</p>
<p>患者喻之剛現年十九歲，當彼在十七歲發育之時，即情慾衝動，自不能制，乃日以手淫自伐，因之釀成遺精，致發育受偌大之打擊，遂至各部纖小，體弱多病，今春來余處診治，余乃以「希米脫氏固精片」治其遺精，而以「生殖素」補之，如是三旬之久，體重亦逐漸增加，而身體各部，無不重獲發育云。</p>
<h3>風濕骨痛之療法</h3>
<p>— 賈治中醫師</p>
<p>吾人每未至暮年，而已呈衰頽乏象。甚至腎虧腰痠，筋絡牽疼，骨節酸楚。此種病痛，純由平時感染風濤而來，餘毒內蘊壯年無病之時，因抵抗力之强，故均隱伏體內。稍有可乘之機，即伺隙進襲。此病以中年人曁老年人患之甚多，幾有普遍之現象。即俗語所謂「發節氣」，蓋即表示至節邊必感骨痛之謂也。如不及早治愈，將成終身不愈之症，為害甚大，市上主治風濕骨痛之藥，當以「强斯登氏骨痛片」為首屈一指，蓋此藥不但治愈一切骨痛，且能防止中風及尿毒等症，而以之預防動脈硬化，允具神效，世有感骨痛症之痛苦者，不妨購服一試，即可使之骨節舒適，腰背輕健，與前剁若兩人矣。</p>
<h3>病理質疑</h3>
<p>女子怪症</p>
<p>余年二九，在十五歲時發育迄今，從未生病。近忽息一怪症，每决月經，並無定時，竟有每旬日必來一次，或間數月不行，或行則十數日不止，請醫診治，毫無效騐，並經來後，則不能行動，此何病理？應服何藥？　徐月貞問</p>
<p>答恐係卵巢有疾病，內服藥以女用「生殖素」為最佳，服之可使月經調整。且能滋補妳全身康健。同時月經來時不能過度操勞。</p>
<p>屢戒不除</p>
<p>余染煙癮甚深，屢戒不除，實因市上戒煙藥，不甚可靠，而余身體虛弱，誠恐另生他變，務懇示一較良藥品，俾得及早戒除，實所銘感！　王萬和啓</p>
<p>答戒烟藥雖有多種，然均近於代雅片之品。尊體旣一已衰弱過度，則應以「生殖素」那之，同時以育維賜保命注射之，可能安然戒除，且身體不受任何影響。</p>
<p>白帶如膿</p>
<p>余自十一歲即有月經，但據人云：月經不宜過早，過早之後反有害身體。眞的麽？現年十九歲，疾病雖不生，惟白帶甚多，如膿而臭。請示知何藥可以治療。　孫花影</p>
<p>答月經之遲早與白帶毫無關係。白帶則關於身體營養及局部淸潔等事。尊之白帶，應速治療，可外用「療帶靈」治之最有把握</p>
<p>胃痛甚劇</p>
<p>余刻患胃痛甚劇，痛時走頭無路，請速示良藥治之。　陳文</p>
<p>答尊恙並服「胃痛靈」及「健胃素」即可痊愈。</p>
<h3>花柳科戒烟科臨診述例</h3>

<h3>西南有解决之望</h3>
<p>— 他</p>
<p>據昨日京電，軍委會十三日發表人事命令，派余漢謀為廣東綏靖主任，第　軍總司令，兼第四軍第一軍軍長，余已於是日離京返防，大的粵局，卽有解　之望，惟由香港方面電傳，黃旭初建議，粵桂經濟提携，粵允撥二千萬助桂，黃卽乘飛機返邕，繆培南曾被槍决說，若照第二消息看來，則兩廣之局，尙難樂舉。</p>
<p>語曰國家所寳者三，土地人民政治，故此三者，全為成立國家的命脈，而非私人擁護的權利，兩廣當局，不受中央命令，形成割據之局，迄已數年，以致國內的政治，不能全上軌道，被人目為無秩序的國家，此種責任，西西南當局，難逃厥責，因為一個國家，而有兩個以上的政府，各自為政，不相統屬，此種畸形的組織，實為各國所罕見，對內旣不統一，尙何對外可言。</p>
<p>安內而後攘外，原為一定的步驟，內旣不安，則實力分散，自無對外能力可言，現當華北局勢，危如纍卵之際，而兩廣當局，猶假抗敵的美名，而行搗亂後方的策略，實為助敵自攻，此種局面，若不先行設法解决，則對外必無結果，而對內必致摧殘，故余漢謀氏謂精神團結，統一救國，實為根本之圖，蓋不團結如何統一，不統一如何救國，理勢所趨，無可否認。</p>
<p>我國本為科學落後的國家，一切軍用之品，又多仰給於各國，假使力量不分，一致禦禍，猶虞難操勝算，若更分而為二，則禦外之效力更微，萬一西南不能顧全大局，竟致反抗中央，則內戰一起，國卽立亡，內戰中消失一分實力，卽對外减少一分力量，此種寳貴的實力，若浪費於內戰之中，豈不可惜。</p>
<p>故西南當局無論若何宣傳，無論若何强詞奪理，苟其違反精神團結統一救國八個大字，卽為國家之罪人，卽為人民所共棄，蓋在現在情况之下，非一致團結，全力禦禍，實無其他救國之良策。非將私怨私利的觀念，儘量捐除，非將割據分化的局面，從新收拾，則惟有同歸於盡而已。</p>
<h3>餓人</h3>
<p>— 林納</p>
<p>七月半我從洲府吿了假到Manila來。從火車站上出來，我便想起了德了。他是我在老甫慢時的同事，一個靜默的靑年。我走着，跨進了那不甚熟稔的，淤滿泥濕而用着坍倒了籬芭圍着的庭院，順着一條骯髒的，腐蝕了的扶梯，才到達了那所狹小而又不透氣的小房間。在這兒他已住了四個多月了，這四個多月中，他是在一種半飢餓的狀態中過着的。</p>
<p>門虛掩着，我輕輕的敲了兩下，便推進去。房子里是這麼地陰暗，沒有陽光，也呼不到一點空氣，酒臭，腐蝕的霉氣到處充塞着，在門外，我站立了一會，只感到了昏沈和靜寞：但是，不久我便看見了在那細小的角落里，有一架行軍床，在那床上就直躺着一具僵瘦的，半裸了的人體。</p>
<p>他那麽和平而勻整地在呼吸着，嘴巴張大地歪在一邊，全身就像一匹蜷虫似地曲縮着，他睡着，是多麽地甜密啊！想着，我於是便走了進去，在一隻橙子上坐下。</p>
<p>這房子很擁塞，到處充塞着酒瓶子，髒襯衫，還有幾本撕掉了封皮的書本，亂七八糟的躺着，散撤在地上，檯子上以及木架上。我細心地端詳着每一件東西和事物。有了五分鐘光景，突然那半裸着的人體，輕輕地蠕動了，接着我便聽見了一聲低的梁弱的嘆息，他醒了。他底兩隻疲憊的，燃燒着的眼睛，向我詫異地注視着，看了一會，才淡淡地喃道：一是你，朋友來得正好！接着他把眼睛從我身上掉開，向另一方面去，沉思着他便爬起床來，嘴里輕輕的噓着時行的下流歌曲。</p>
<p>我沒有說出任何種話，他那變態的動作，是多麽地使我吃驚着！一個熱誠的友人，就對我這樣冷淡嗎？我苦痛地把頭低下了。</p>
<p>他靜默不逼地從床上及衣架上，檢起了衣服穿上，隨着他底呼嘯聲一般沉濁的，昏悶的酒精氣就在這房子里飛旋着，顯然他底醉意還沒有退盡，他穿上了他底髒襯衫，套着積滿着油垢的工袴，又從衣架上扯下了一頂舊草帽戴上，便低聲的吿訴我道：現在，是我們走的時候了，朋友，我相信你是剛從洲府回來的，不會感覺了疲倦嗎？我搖着頭，於是他歇司底里地笑了一笑，便跑下扶梯去。</p>
<p>通過了這淤積着的泥汚，和坍倒的舊籬笆，繞着一個彎便是大街了。七月天的陽光在燃燒着，已經是十點左右了，街上很冷靜，有幾輪馬車駕着喘氣淋淋的瘦馬，正在乏懶地跑着。我們沉默地揀着那陰暗的地方走，他是變得這麼憂鬱和沮喪，酒精完全把他毀了，的有了十五分鐘光景，在一家地下室酒排間門口，他兀然地止住了，兩眼射着疑感的光向我片視着那兩注泛成紫黑色的薄唇，就輕輕在顫動着。沒有延擱了好多時間，那扇汚穢的門，便把他掩沒了，我稍為沉思了一會，也就跟着進去。</p>
<p>待役很熟成地替他添着酒，而他則一言不發地，用他底燃燒着的眼睛釘在盃上，大口地啜飲着；於是，他底而頰由靑蒼而氣成暈紅了，眼睛就射着熊熊的火熖。</p>
<p>朋友，我想：你一定很感詫異的，他興奮地呌道，面上狡猾地微笑着。我低聲地說着我底感想，他便大聲的笑了起來。你現在已經是紳士了，而我，是什麽一個失業者，一個等待末日到來的餓人。這一向從朋友底口中，你也許會知道我過着的是什麼壞的生活。人們由於我愛祖國，曾不斷在社會上，揭破了他們大批收買仇貨，換上國貨商標欺騙了自已僑胞底陰謀，把我辭退了，完全把我趕進了飢餓的狀態中，然而，我相信着我自已，愛祖國是沒有錯的！你看我酒喝得很利害吧；這是沒關緊要的，朋友，你要知道我正在為着自己底信仰，而創造着一種事業。</p>
<p>他底話是說的那麽隨便和什亂，使得我戚覺他說是只是醉話，於是我便疑慮地鎖着眉，但是他却認眞地呌道：</p>
<p>你不相信嗎？接着他絕望地搖着頭道：你已經是紳士了，我們木是同路人，你因此也永遠地不會了解了我：但是，你看着，在木久的將來。……他生氣地從坐位上站了起來，向櫃台上輕輕的揚着手，便走出去。我遲呆着，心底刺傷使我低下頭去。</p>
<p>一個星期後，我忽促地從Manila回轉洲府去，路上碰到了一個熟人，才知道在兩天前他已被捕了；為的他曾率領好些無業流氓，帶着科刀和炸彈，去炸毀那些販賣仇貨的華僑商店。我感動地低住頭，心里低低的對自已喃道：德，你幹的對！……，輕輕的覺着，眼睛有點潤濕了。</p>

<h3>院子</h3>
<p>— 胡慰</p>
<p>我回到故鄉來了。當小火輪在碼頭停住的時候，嘈雜的呌販聲，和按客的黃包車夫的爭吵，那種親切的鄉音，勾引起我無限的感傷，已經五年沒有回到家鄉了啊！</p>
<p>家里人都很高興。他們忙着為我收拾房間。因為弟弟前年結婚，屋後新建了三間樓房，母親的意思要我住到新屋里去，弟兄多年不見面，也好親近親近。如果我也馬上結婚的話，新屋兩旁還有空地，可以把二間樓房擴充到五間或七間的。但是我愛好舊宅里的那個院子，我從前的臥室是面臨着那個院子的，我會耗費許多時間和精神把那院子闢成一個小小的花園。自然在五年之中，那院子已經塌頹得不成模樣了。我告訴母親，這一次回來恐怕要多住些時，我想把院子重復舊觀，再到新屋去和弟弟同住。</p>
<p>已經是掌燈時分了，僕們再忙着打掃我那間舊臥室。緊閉了五年，屋子發着一股刺鼻的霉汚味。但是那一几一榻，都和我十分熟稔的，都是我癖愛的物件。這些東西已經和我分離了五年，現在我彷彿回到舊情人懷里那樣高興，脫了長衣，幫着僕役們　掃，把　回家　　書籍安插到書架上，四壁依舊懸掛起我喜歡的像片，書桌上安放了一些高興讀的書，不到晚餐時候，那臥室已恢復五年前的模樣了。</p>
<p>晚餐時候，弟弟沽了一瓶酒，大家開懷暢飲。母親將酒蓋了臉，又嘮嘮叨已提要我娶親的話了。因為合家難得歡聚，我不忍傷年老人的心。答應了，晚上，在我房里談天，鑒賞已很遲了。</p>
<p>一到鄉下，生活馬上改變了，而且我念着那個院子，屋後雞聲一啼，我已起床來了。我先推開窗，跳到院子里。院子里除了一株桂樹，一株石榴樹枝葉生得更茂盛外，那些我種植的花草，都變成了空盆並列在石條上，空地上生着長長的芟草，一個金魚缸，站在窗前已經瞧不見它的地位了。我重復跳進來，掏出衣櫥下藏着的鐮刀，挾了一雙小凳，到院子里割草。到太陽推上半空的時候，母親在外面呌門了。「睡得多熟時，昨得多熟呵」她一面敲門一面喊着。</p>
<p>我掛着一頭汗，抓着兩手泥開出門去，引得母親笑了起來。</p>
<p>「還是孩子脾氣，想着就要做。剛回來也好休息幾天，割草好呌阿福做去，弄得象個什麽模樣？」</p>
<p>其實我知道祇要我回家來，母親什麽都是高興的。她馬上哈哈女僕注水，搬早膳出來。</p>
<p>午後，我去望了幾家親戚，那是鄉下的規矩。從前讀書時候，寒假暑假歸家，也要從這家到那家去探望一次的。</p>
<p>太陽東山回到家。弟弟在鄉村小學做教員的，一星期有一天值班，弟媳告訴我他今天住在校里了。母親也是午後出雲沒有回來，這個家彷彿已經換了一件模樣了的。自從父親故世，母親就要我娶親，她說：</p>
<p>「家里這樣零落，祇有你們兩個娶了，再熱鬧起來……」</p>
<p>現在弟弟不是娶了嗎？而我祇　有感到更寂寞。我回到房里，看着那個不成樣的院子，又鼓起興緻來雲剷除那些芟草，祇有那個院子對於我是不生疏的！</p>
<p>母親回來了，在堂屋里就喊着我的名字，聲音慢慢近來直到我的臥室：</p>
<p>「雄兒，我討來許多花種，荷花也問你舅舅討了兩缸……」她與忽忽的踏進房來，我剛拖着一雙站在窗前，她又：「你這孩子，真是……」</p>
<p>她把花種授給我，有爬牆的牽牛花，石臘紅，月季鳳仙，還有幾沒有花蕊，我呌不出它的名字。我接着花種，心里又難受起來，母親這大半天恐怕是為了我到各人家去討花種的。自然，父親故世後，母親的精神都放在我們弟兄兩個身上了，但是她的「精神」祇　是希望我們早些娶房媳婦，好讓她及早抱着孫兒。我不能接受好的「精神」，五年來遙遙頭地飄泊在都市里，雖然她想寫了許多信來，祇　要我在家里，決不繩帶我娶親。弟弟討親那年，又催着我回家，但是我始終使她撚，她一年一年地，直到現在，那是為了下月父親安葬而不得不回家的。</p>
<p>母親知道我喜歡那個院子，知道我喜歡種花，她馬上不辭勞苦去討那末多的花種來。但是另一方面我知道她一貫的「精神」，她要把我關在家里，早些討一房媳婦兒使她高興。</p>
<p>果然，她和我談起那回事了。母親幾道掛下淚來，她說：</p>
<p>「你弟弟娶了，你再不娶親戚們要說我私心的。本來鄉下的規矩要依次嫁娶，那已經是越規了。」</p>
<p>一個五年沒有回家的兒子，我再不能傷年老人的心了。</p>
<p>院子次第地恢復舊觀了：石級上的花盆里紅綠相映，牽牛花高高地爬上牆端了，二缸荷花，葉子衝出水面了，金魚也在缸里遊泳着了，我又生活在舊的環境中了。</p>
<p>母親又要我搬到新屋里去和弟弟同住，我懂她的意思，新的一代應該住新屋子的，那可以卜個家庭的欣榮。</p>
<p>從早到晚弟弟是有了妻室的丈夫了，他似乎很迷戀現在安定的生活，我覺我們同時代的青年也和隔離得那樣遠。在這個家庭里，我是個孤獨者，我每天還是在舊臥室里（現在是改名呌做書房了）對着院子過着寂寞的生活。</p>
<p>院子在我的努力之下恢復五年前的樣子了，但是五年前的我和我的家庭呢？我常常這樣問着自己。</p>
<p>做一只天空中的飛騰，還是做我母親的孝子，我矛盾地生活着……</p>

<h3>The Second Plenary Session Concluded Yesterday; The Third Meeting Resolved to Send a Telegram of Condolences to Wang; Passed the Draft of the General Assembly Declaration</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Second Plenary Session held its third general meeting at 9 a.m. on the 14th. The attendees included Central Executive Committee members Chiang Kai-shek, Feng Yuxiang, Yu Youren, Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, Ye Zhengcang, He Yingqin, Zhu Peide, Ju Zheng, Chen Lifu, Wang Quansheng, Luo Sang Jian Zan, Wang Boqun, Ye Xiufeng, and 88 others; observers from the Supervisory Committee Lin Sen, Zhang Ji, Cai Yuanpei, Yang Hu, Shao Lizi, Chu Minyi, Xu Yongchang, Pang Bingxun, and 24 others; observers from alternate Executive Committee members Gu Zhengding, Lai Lian, Jing Hengyi, Xiao Zheng, Li Renren, Yang Yongtai, Cheng Tiangu, Zhang Zhen, Huang Shi, and 37 others; observers from alternate Supervisory Committee members Lu Dangping, Lei Zhen, Pan Yunchao, Cui Guangxiu, Sun Ruiya, and 18 others, totaling 162 people. Kong Xiangxi chaired the meeting.</p>
<p>Reported Matters (1) Reading of the minutes of the second meeting; (2) Secretary's Office report on documents.</p>
<p>Matters for Discussion (1) The Party Affairs Group of the Proposal Review Committee reported on the submitted work reports of the Standing Committee and the three departments of Organization, Propaganda, and Public Training. After the meeting's review, the results are reported as follows: Upon reviewing the work of the Standing Committee and various departments for the six months since the closing of the First Plenary Session, it is generally found that they have been able to diligently implement the principles determined by the Fifth National Congress and the guidelines resolved by the First Plenary Session. However, in practice, it seems that the established policies have not been effectively applied to increase the vitality of party affairs and further solidify its foundation. This is because the environment is inevitably subject to obstacles, and party affairs and the actual political and social situation have not been able to advance simultaneously in a suitable manner, which is the crux of the problem. Therefore, it seems necessary to make significant improvements in the future. Whether this is appropriate is respectfully submitted for public decision. Resolution: Passed according to the review opinion. (2) Proposed by the Presidium: 1. A case to send a telegram of condolences to Chairman Wang Zhaoming in the name of the Second Plenary Session. Resolution: Passed. 2. Draft declaration case for the second plenary session. Resolution: Amended and passed. The meeting adjourned at 11 a.m. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 14th)</p>
<p>Circumstances of the Closing Ceremony of the Plenary Session</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the adjournment of the third general meeting of the Second Plenary Session at 11 a.m. on the 14th, the closing ceremony was held in the Central Auditorium after a short break. The participants included more than 160 Central Committee members, the same as those at the third general meeting, and more than 100 staff members from the Secretariat of the Plenary Session, totaling 300 people. At 11:10 a.m., the ceremony was declared open. Chairman Feng Yuxiang first led the orchestra, and then led everyone in performing the rituals. Feng then delivered a closing speech. After the speech, Feng read out the General Assembly Declaration. After the reading, the ceremony concluded. The Second Plenary Session opened on the morning of the 10th and lasted five days until the 14th, with one preparatory meeting, three general meetings, one review meeting, and four meetings of the Presidium. Important cases such as the organization of the National Defense Conference were passed, and the intentions of the General Assembly were also fully stated in the declaration. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 14th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Feng Yuxiang said in his speech at the closing ceremony of the Second Plenary Session: Although the term of this Second Plenary Session was not long, the spirit was very good. In such hot weather, everyone gathered together calmly to discuss all major plans for national salvation. Such a good scene cannot be seen elsewhere. It is really a very good phenomenon. The most important and noteworthy thing in this conference is the National Defense Conference. This conference can be said to be a national salvation conference. It is really very important. The closing declaration of the plenary session mentioned that we hope that our determined comrades will participate in this conference, contribute their opinions to the central government, and work together unanimously. What is especially important is that some comrades who are not very clear about the intentions of the central government should do our best to make them all clear. We must truly and frankly speak for the nation and the people, so that they can understand the intentions of the central government and resolutely stand on the same front with the central government. Only in this way can our nation have a way out. In the meetings of the past two days, two gentlemen reported on the issue of national defense. This is because we were afraid that some of our comrades were not clear about it, so we specially gave a detailed report to make everyone understand the central government's preparations. Today our meeting is over. After the adjournment, we hope that all comrades will, in the spirit of the meeting, work hard and strive forward in accordance with the teachings of the Premier, to save our country and revive our nation. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 14th)</p>
<p>Full Text of the Declaration of the Second Plenary Session</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The declaration of the Second Plenary Session is as follows: More than half a year has passed since the Fifth National Congress and the First Plenary Session. Looking back on this period, the internal and external environment has become increasingly difficult and dangerous. The sincere spirit of the people of the whole country, amidst extreme anxiety and suffering, to face the national crisis together has become increasingly profound. What the people earnestly expect from our party is how to unite the people's will and strength to save the country, resist the current foreign insults, and preserve the survival of the nation. What our party has been persistently and responsibly doing, exerting its greatest efforts, is also aimed at this goal. At this plenary session, the attendance of comrades from the central government was unprecedented. Most comrades, either shouldering heavy responsibilities or having not been to the capital for a long time, all came to the capital to discuss major plans together. The abolition of the two southwestern organizations was proposed by the majority of comrades from Guangdong and Guangxi, which is sufficient to eliminate the divisions and estrangement since the Fourth National Congress, demonstrate the actual centralization and unification of the party and the country, and eradicate the conspiracies of slander and division. It can be seen that sincere unity has long been a common sentiment, and the determination to overcome difficulties together is increasingly evident. After examining the external environment and reviewing the internal conditions of the country, the plenary session seeks to clarify to all party comrades and the people of the whole country how to truly unify the will to save the country and achieve the goal of national salvation. The Fifth National Congress, with its focus on national salvation, has already clearly indicated to us the correct and unchanging direction and basic essentials. It believes that in China today, without striving through self-imposed hardship and thoroughly renewing awareness to establish a "modern state" with developed and abundant human and material resources, there is no way to overcome the dangers of the environment and lay the foundation of the country on a solid foundation. For the main points of resisting foreign insults, it also clearly indicates the limits of choosing national policies, supplemented by the determination of the final sacrifice. All resolutions are not only believed by party comrades as the truth of national salvation, but also recognized by the general patriotic and enlightened citizens as a point of common effort. The plenary session reviewed the central party and government measures over the past six months, believing that they have indeed been able to adhere to the direction entrusted by the Fifth National Congress, striving hard and achieving considerable progress in an environment of internal troubles and external aggressions. In terms of diplomacy, although the degree of national crisis is deepening and becoming more serious, the central government has responded sternly and dealt honestly, striving to bring diplomacy back to the right track. The efforts of the soldiers of Hebei, Chahar, and the entire country to maintain national rights have significantly changed the international view of us, and the hope of peaceful negotiations has not been completely extinguished. In terms of internal affairs, reforms such as currency reform, financial stability, construction progress, as well as suppressing bandits and preventing natural disasters, have all achieved rapid and significant results after enduring hardships. The timely promulgation of the draft constitution and the scheduled convening of the National Assembly are proceeding in an orderly manner, not only showing good faith to the people, but also gathering the minds and talents of the whole country to jointly plan for national salvation. As for completing the organization of a "modern state," the main focus is not only on striving to build the national economy and strengthen self-defense capabilities in the material aspect, but also on restoring the inherent morality of the nation and awakening national consciousness. Efforts should be made to cultivate public training and student training in various places, which are sufficient to unify the will to save the country and arouse the spirit of defending the country. At the same time, universal development of national education is sought, and opportunities are sought for unemployed youth to serve. The main purpose is to enhance the morality and strength of the people, implicitly strengthening the foundation for national defense, and continuously strive to complete the organization of a "modern state." If we can work together consistently and move forward along this path, we will surely establish the foundation for national rejuvenation. This is what all wise men in the country are working with and deeply believe in. Moreover, the spirit of the so-called "modern state" lies in the unity of strength and the strictness of discipline. There has never been a case where scattered strength can resist insults, nor has there ever been a case where lax discipline can build a country. Today, if the whole country, from top to bottom, sincerely wants to resist foreign insults, it must cherish the unified situation achieved through ten years of hard work and sacrifice, and absolutely abide by the public discipline related to the national life. If we can train discipline in education and organization, the people can be united and not scattered, and the country can naturally increase its strength. If we can respect discipline in politics and military affairs, the central government and the local governments can be like the arm being used by the body and the finger being used by the arm, and the remnants of separatism and feudalism can be swept away. The country's strength will have accumulated increase and true unity, and the solid foundation needed for the country's struggle against foreign countries will be established. In short, the way to survive and save the country is none other than resisting insults, and the prerequisite for resisting insults is to concentrate all the strength to save the country under the central command, unify its pace, and consolidate its front. Therefore, unity and discipline are the unshakable iron rules for resisting insults and saving the country, and the unification of military and political orders is the minimum requirement for completing the organization of a "modern state." This is what those who talk about national defense must know, and what all compatriots today must understand. The recent changes in Guangdong and Guangxi, revealing the banner of foreign aggression and shaking the foundation of unity, have added fear of disintegration to the country amidst its worries and difficulties. On the one hand, it is sufficient to reflect the difficult and complex environment in which China is today. At the same time, it also proves that if the various parts of the country cannot maintain strict discipline and unity, it is not enough to establish a foundation for external resistance, but will only aggravate the national crisis. Since the occurrence of this incident, the central government has felt the danger of national affairs and cherished the strength of the country. It has always been trying to handle it carefully with peaceful methods, hoping to reverse the dangerous situation invisibly and promote the awareness of unity. Fortunately, public opinion across the country has been able to distinguish right from wrong, speak up and advise, and the people of Guangdong, the source of the revolution, have long been influenced by revolutionary doctrines and will not be shaken by deceptive words. The officers and soldiers of the Guangdong army, navy, and air force have been able to reveal justice, cherish the glorious history of the revolution, and do their best to maintain the unity of the country. This is what all patriotic compatriots in the country are happy about, and it is also the true will and strength of our country during the period of serious national crisis. However, the Guangdong military authorities have already initiated dissent, acted freely, violated the discipline of the party and the state, and shaken the foundation of the revolution. Although the central government has been patiently tolerant, there is still no sign of repentance. According to the national discipline, it should not be tolerated by the people. The plenary session is deeply saddened by the changes in Guangdong and Guangxi, and in view of the difficulties of national affairs, it is unwilling to lightly use the limited strength to impose internal sanctions. Therefore, it still adheres to the Premier's spirit of generosity and strives to eliminate the changes politically and bring them back to the right track, only seeking to ensure that the country's political and military orders can be effectively implemented from now on, the distinction between right and wrong is clear, and the laws and regulations are not damaged. Not only does it not want to make harsh demands on this incident, but it also traces the causes of estrangement and errors, and seeks to eliminate the basis for alienation and exploitation. For military comrades who have a history of joint revolution, they are still willing to entrust them with the authority of national defense and seek further unity. At the same time, it is also felt that responsible comrades in various places all have the spirit of saving the country, but there are few opportunities for joint discussion. At this critical moment of survival, it is even more necessary to concentrate efforts and share the heavy responsibilities. Therefore, the National Defense Conference was established, hoping to gather the thoughts and talents of the whole country, express good plans for saving the country, and plan for the safety and enrichment of the entire national defense, in order to establish the foundation for survival and national salvation. The plenary session firmly believes that this measure will be in line with the national desire to save the country and will create a force of cooperation and unity. It is also necessary to inform our compatriots across the country that the more difficult and dangerous the situation of the country, the more orderly and solemn the will and actions of the people should be. The people who take it upon themselves to save the country and the responsible central government must have thorough trust and strong perseverance. Those who can do this will prosper, and those who do the opposite will perish. This has always been the case, both in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. It must have the determination to sacrifice and fight in order to undertake a long-term and arduous undertaking. China has suffered from many internal diseases and is bound by external forces in the past 100 years, and is also in the vortex of international conflicts. It can be known how difficult it is to build a country. Our party, upholding the Premier's legacy and shouldering the great task of revolution, can expect the arrival of dangers and difficulties. It will never slacken its responsibilities due to the difficulties of national affairs. It is also well aware of the century-long interests of the nation and will never allow it to be taken lightly. The sacrifice of one person or one party is a small matter, while the sacrifice of the country and the nation is a big matter. Our country has already reached this extraordinary period unprecedented in history. The correctness of the decision at this time is related to the continuation of thousands of years of history and the peace and security of the nation for thousands of generations. Therefore, not only should our party, which is responsible for building the country, be patient and calm in dealing with events, but also all our compatriots should bear all the responsibilities for the past history and the future of the nation at this critical moment of survival, recognize the responsibilities of the times, and face them with an absolutely serious and cautious attitude. In short, the current situation in China is that if we do not seek survival with a determined heart, we will not be able to obtain security. If we do not act with unity across the country and take orderly steps to seek salvation, we will not escape the crisis of being defeated one by one. Therefore, at this time, the people of the whole country can only, based on the sincere intention of saving the country, give the central government thorough trust, be able to unite and maintain unity, and consolidate the central government, so that it can bear its responsibilities and use the coordinated strength of the whole country to save the country and protect the nation. Then, no matter how difficult the environment is, we will definitely be able to reverse the crisis and create a great cause of rejuvenation. Otherwise, if the will is not unified, the steps are not uniform, we will build a house on the road, undermine discipline, and the foundation will be damaged. Even without foreign enemies, we will inevitably collapse and cannot be saved. Our party has been entrusted with the heavy responsibility by our compatriots across the country. It must do its best to use its mind and talents, and carry it through to the end, even if the situation becomes more dangerous, it will never give up in the midst of encirclement and attack, and will establish the foundation for the sound organization of the country for my China, and seek permanent survival for my nation. What we dare to solemnly declare to the people is that the country is in this extraordinary situation, and we can only seek the unity of the people across the country with the greatest tolerance and care internally, and we will never tolerate any fact of infringing on territorial sovereignty externally, nor will we sign any agreement that infringes on territorial sovereignty. If there is a fact of infringement on territorial sovereignty, and if all political methods are exhausted and ineffective, and the fundamental survival of the country and the nation is threatened, then we must make the determination of the final sacrifice, without any hesitation. This is the policy determined by the Fifth National Congress, and now it is further interpreted and revealed, in order to be shared by comrades of the party and compatriots across the country.

<p>The General Assembly Sends a Telegram of Condolences to Chairman Wang</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Before the opening of the Second Plenary Session, the Chairman had telegraphed from Germany to the General Assembly, requesting leave.

<p>(Nanjing) The Secretariat of the Second Plenary Session recently received a telegram from more than ten groups, including the Manila Chinese Chamber of Commerce in the Philippines, saying: "National affairs are difficult and foreign insults are imminent. Now that leaders from all parties are gathering together to discuss national affairs, the rise and fall, safety and danger are of great importance. Overseas Chinese have heard of this and deeply look forward to it. The country is in a time of crisis, and what the people hope from you is to remove prejudices, be open and honest with each other, adhere to the original intention of sincere unity, and determine the strategy of resisting the enemy and saving the country. As for military affairs and finance, we should strive for unity, so as to unify the front and jointly face the national crisis. It is a matter of life and death, and we hope that you will earnestly consider it. Our association and others are in a foreign country, but our hearts are with the motherland. Upholding the duty of every man to do his part, we cannot remain silent. We earnestly appeal and hope that you will understand. We are anxiously looking forward to your reply." Signed, The Manila Chinese Chamber of Commerce in the Philippines and eleven other groups. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 14th)</p>

<h3>The Conclusion of the Second Plenary Session</h3>
<p>— Gao</p>
<p>The Fifth Second Plenary Session, after three general meetings, was declared closed yesterday. The major cases of current importance have been mostly discussed and completed. The most noteworthy resolutions, such as the organization of the National Defense Conference, the abolition of the two southwestern organizations, and the change of the pacification director of Guangdong Province, are all issues that we believe are not easy to handle. However, they were able to consider things carefully within the appropriate limits and take everything into account. The result of this plenary session cannot be said to be without considerable success.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the opening of the plenary session, what we were most concerned about was the difficulty in dealing with the Guangdong-Guangxi issue. The slogans advocated by Guangdong and Guangxi were to promote resistance to foreign aggression, the central government's prerequisite steps were to unify military orders, and the people's only request was to eliminate civil war. Although there is no conflict of interest in the grand plan of national salvation, the actual implementation showed a situation of division. Guangdong and Guangxi took advantage of the name of resisting the enemy and evolved into a fact of independent action. In order to maintain its prestige, the central government could not avoid imposing considerable sanctions. Once the mood was lost, war would break out. Therefore, at that time, we exhausted our wisdom and hoped that the authorities would promote cooperation with the greatest tolerance. Fortunately, the efforts of the gentlemen of the General Assembly have yielded such a result. The organization of the National Defense Conference is the first step in accommodating the opinions of the military personnel of Guangdong and Guangxi. The abolition of the two southwestern organizations is the precursor to the unification of power. The change of the pacification director of Guangdong Province is to take into account the prestige of the central government. At the same time, Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, and others were given good positions to maintain the status quo. Chen Jitang, who was dismissed, was also given a seat as a member of the National Defense Conference to avoid embarrassment, so as to eliminate subjective emotions and promote sincere unity. Such a stable arrangement should be understood by all parties, and we hope that the fear that has filled our hearts for months will be dispelled.</p>
<p>The joint decision on the major plan of resisting foreign aggression is also one of the things we have been eagerly looking forward to at the General Assembly. Since Foreign Minister Zhang announced the diplomatic process of the past six months at the General Assembly and Chairman Chiang reported the steps to save the country and resist foreign aggression, both recognized that the current diplomatic path has not yet reached the final juncture. Chiang also clearly showed the limits of his tolerance and the time when he could not tolerate it. This shows that the central government has never been without careful planning for the major plan of resisting foreign aggression. In the future, the unified situation will be formed, and the National Defense Conference will begin. For the adjustment of the entire diplomacy, it will be able to use concentrated strength as a solid backing. Looking at the figures contained in the members of the National Defense, they are either important figures in various aspects or the top choices for defense. They should be able to sharpen their skills and write their hearts and minds, so as to jointly plan a calm and unified pace and prepare for extraordinary and necessary responses. The pivot of national survival has reached the most critical stage. Can the whole country not be careful and strive to move forward?</p>

<p>(Guangzhou) The troops under Yu Hanmou, the newly appointed commander-in-chief of the Guangdong Army and the Pacification Commissioner of Guangdong Province, are preparing to move out today to implement the orders of the Central Executive Committee. Their vanguard has reached Pingshi, fifteen miles from the Jiangxi border. Chen Jitang's army, in order to shorten the battle line, has withdrawn to Shaoguan, seventy-five miles to the southwest. This army is composed of the Guangdong Second Army under Zhang Da, which recently concentrated in Yuechang, and other troops that recently invaded Hunan Province. News of the outbreak of war on the front line has been received here, but it has not yet been confirmed. Although the claim that the Guangxi army has arrived in Guangzhou and is heading to the North River area, according to Chen Jitang and Li Zongren's arrangements, has been denied, everyone believes it to be true. Guangzhou and its suburbs are currently stepping up defenses. The Southwest Political Committee held a meeting today to discuss the overall situation, which lasted for three hours. The atmosphere throughout the city is very serious, but the people remain calm. The most significant aspect is the continued stability of the financial situation, and the Guangdong currency has risen. The Customs Political Committee is holding a meeting.</p>
<h3>Yu Hanmou Takes Office in Dayu; Circular Telegram Believes the Safety of Guangdong Lies Solely on Chen; Two Elders from the Capital Will Go to Guangdong in a Private Capacity to Persuade Chen</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Yu Hanmou flew to Jiangxi and has transferred to the front line. He made the military decision to take up the posts of Pacification Commissioner of Guangdong, Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Route Army, and Commander of the First Army. After meeting with the division commanders on the border, he is preparing to return to Guangzhou as a pioneer in resolving the current situation. Many of Chen Jitang's troops have expressed their obedience to the central government. Commissioners familiar with the Guangdong situation believe that Chen has been widely abandoned and cannot achieve anything. Even if he is ignorant of the greater good and stubbornly refuses to come to his senses, there will definitely not be any major disturbances. Although no formal telegrams from Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi have arrived in the capital, their tone in private telegrams to central committee members here is much more conciliatory. The central government, in order to rectify discipline and consider the deep comradeship, friendship, and kindness, has made a concrete decision. However, due to the urgency of the overall situation, the authorities will carefully consider the wording of the declaration before it is issued. (Reuters dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>The Guangdong members of the Central Committee attending the meeting plan to recommend two elders to go south in a private capacity to persuade Chen Jitang to consider the overall situation and return military and political power to the central government. The two elders are considering it, and it has not yet been decided when they will depart. (Dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) He Jian, Chairman of Hunan Province, visited Chairman Lin and military authorities on the 14th. He stated that the affairs of Guangdong and Guangxi had been resolved by the plenary session, but the issue of Chen Jitang's personal advancement and retreat had not yet been settled. He specifically sent a telegram to Chen, asking him to abide by the central government's orders, consolidate the safety of the party and the country, and retire when he sees the opportunity. (Dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>Telegram from Dayu: To Chairman Lin of the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government, Chairman Jiang of the Military Affairs Commission, Vice Chairmen Yan and Feng, Premier Jiang of the Executive Yuan, the ministers and vice ministers of the various Yuan, the chairmen and directors of the various ministries and commissions, the party headquarters, provincial and municipal governments, pacification commissioners, commanders-in-chief, commanders, army and division commanders, commanders, various agencies, courts, and newspapers of each province and city: On the 12th of this month, I received an appointment from the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government, specially appointing Yu Hanmou as Pacification Commissioner of Guangzhou and Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Route Army. I respectfully took the oath of office at Dayu on the 14th. Aware of my limited talents, I have been entrusted with a heavy responsibility. Now that the country's affairs are unsettled, how dare I claim credit? I can only vow to be loyal and repay the Party and the country. However, there is something I cannot refrain from saying about the Guangdong situation. In recent years, foreign troubles have been pressing daily. Without resisting aggression, we cannot seek survival. Without unification, we cannot resist aggression. The central government's efforts to achieve peaceful unification are truly a crucial plan to concentrate forces to save the country. I, Hanmou, formerly led troops into Jiangxi, vowing to suppress the communists, resist Japan, and achieve peaceful unification to save the country. In all my actions, I have dared not deviate. Unfortunately, at a time when our Guangdong is facing national crisis, it suddenly took up arms, secretly colluded with foreign bandits, invaded neighboring provinces, and launched a civil war, undermining unification. The facts are evident and cannot be denied. My loyal words were rejected, and my benevolence and wisdom were exhausted. Therefore, I flew to the capital to request instructions, hoping to salvage the situation. I advocated obeying the central government, ceasing fighting, and resisting aggression, which should be understood by the people of the country. Reflecting on my life in the military, I have always been content with simplicity. I have no desire for power and rights. However, the survival of the country and the nation cannot be ignored. Therefore, I resolutely took office to fulfill my original intention. This sincere heart can be attested by Heaven and Earth. Today, the safety of the Guangdong situation rests solely on Bo Gong's (Chen Jitang's) shoulders. I urge him to obey the central government, release his troops and go to the capital to assist in important matters. Then peaceful unification can be achieved immediately, and the great plan to resist aggression will not be disrupted. The comrades in Guangdong are mostly stirred up. The central government is generous and treats everyone equally, without discrimination. They should be able to understand this heart and advocate justice together. Resisting aggression and seeking survival depends on this. I respectfully offer my sincere heart and plead my true feelings. I await your clear instructions.</p>
<h3>He Yingqin and Others Send Telegrams of Comfort to the Commanders of Two Guangdong Torpedo Boats; The Two Boats Have Sailed from Hong Kong to Xiamen to Await Orders</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Deng Wenguang and Deng Ruigong, the commanders of the No. 1 and No. 4 torpedo boats of the Guangdong Navy, led their ships away from Guangdong, supported the central government, and issued a circular telegram expressing their attitude. He Yingqin and others, the Minister of Military Affairs and Minister of Political Affairs, believed that Deng Wenguang and others were loyal to the country and worthy of commendation. They specifically sent a telegram on the 14th to encourage them. The original telegram is as follows: To Deng Wenguang, commander of the No. 1 torpedo boat of the Navy, Deng Ruigong, commander of the No. 4 torpedo boat, and all comrades: We have received and read your telegrams. The comrades could not bear to see the navy, which is building the country, being used by a few individuals. You resolutely led your ships away from Guangdong and unanimously supported the central government, which is truly commendable. The Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee has already made fair and appropriate arrangements for the recent disputes in Guangdong and Guangxi. It is hoped that you will persuade the comrades of the Guangdong provincial river defense ships nearby to rise up together, obey the government's orders, and promote national unification. It is also hoped that you will continue to work hard to train officers and soldiers and promote the spirit of fearlessness to fulfill the heavy responsibility of protecting the country. We earnestly pray and wish you success.</p>

<h3>Rumors of Chen Jitang Withdrawing Customs Revenue Deposits</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreign dispatches reported that Chen Jitang sent personnel to the Guangzhou branch of the Bank of China on the 14th to forcibly withdraw customs revenue deposits. The bank authorities replied that these were deposits handled by the Customs Ta務司 [Inspector General of Customs] and, according to banking regulations, could only be withdrawn by the depositor in person. Chen became enraged and threatened to close the bank to force the withdrawal of customs revenue. The bank authorities refused based on reason and urgently telegraphed the head office for instructions. The reporter, believing that this matter concerned national finance, specifically visited a responsible official of the Ministry of Finance to inquire about the truth. According to the official, the ministry had also received reports of this matter. The Guangzhou branch of the Bank of China's refusal to Chen Jitang's forced withdrawal of customs revenue deposits, in accordance with banking regulations, was indeed an appropriate measure. If, unfortunately, this truly leads to Chen Jitang closing the bank, the government will devise other countermeasures to maintain the safety of the financial sector. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) According to reliable sources, the Guangzhou authorities have now demanded that the local manager of the Bank of China hand over the customs revenue that should be remitted to the central government. It is reported that the Bank of China authorities have refused. It is widely believed that the Guangdong authorities may seize it by force. (Reuters dispatch on the 14th)</p>

<h3>Central Commemoration Week: Chairman Chiang's Report on Unification to Save the Nation</h3>
<p>1.  The foundation of diplomacy lies entirely in domestic affairs; therefore, the unification of domestic affairs is the key to resisting foreign aggression.</p>
<p>2.  The Central Government, regarding the Guangdong and Guangxi incident, has consistently maintained a spirit of magnanimity, using political means and peaceful methods to resolve everything.</p>
<p>3.  The unification of political and military orders is a fundamental requirement for dealing with foreign countries.</p>
<p>4.  The Central Government can never abandon the pacification of internal disorder due to the severity of foreign troubles.</p>
<p>5.  In resolving domestic problems, both reason and sentiment must be taken into account, but right and wrong, obedience and disobedience, must also be clearly distinguished.</p>
<p>6.  The revolutionary government is determined to fight to the end amidst attacks from both within and without, from beginning to end.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) (Continued from yesterday) Since September 18th, the consistent policy of the Central Government has been "internal pacification first, external resistance second." It is believed that if the interior is not secure, not only can there be no external resistance, but even the word "diplomacy" cannot be discussed. From this, it can be seen that although the important cases discussed in this plenary meeting include both domestic and foreign affairs, they are actually only a domestic issue. I have always believed that the foundation of diplomacy lies entirely in domestic affairs. As long as domestic problems can be properly resolved, diplomatic problems can naturally be satisfactorily resolved. Everyone must understand that if our domestic affairs can truly be unified and the foundation of the country can be stabilized, any powerful country in the world will respect and fear us. As long as we are truly unified, no one will dare to be our enemy. Therefore, the matters discussed in this meeting should especially focus on resolving domestic problems to stabilize the foundation of the country, realize our Three Principles of the People, and complete the task of revolutionary nation-building. Speaking of domestic affairs, both the central and local governments are now responsible by comrades of our party. Therefore, all domestic instability and disunity are the result of the failure of party comrades to unite or even disputes. It can never be blamed on the general public who love the country. Now, if we want to unify and stabilize domestic affairs, we must first resolve internal party disputes. To resolve this dispute, we should, of course, handle everything in accordance with party discipline and national law. However, the revolutionary spirit of our party is based on the eight virtues of "loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, harmony, and peace." Regardless of any internal or external problem, we have always sought proper solutions in the spirit of "trustworthiness, righteousness, and peace," which is especially important internally. In the past, Chen Jiongming revolted in Guangzhou, attacking the presidential palace with artillery and machine guns, trying to kill the premier. However, the premier still tolerated him with a benevolent spirit. In the end, as long as Chen Jiongming could repent and reform, he would not be held responsible for the past. The premier's great spirit is truly a revolutionary model for all our party comrades. Now everyone is very concerned about the Guangdong and Guangxi incident. If this matter is purely based on the country's laws and disciplines, there is naturally no room for indulgence or tolerance. However, the central government has always been as tolerant as possible, based on trustworthiness, righteousness, and peace, and has never given up political means and peaceful methods to resolve the issue. It is also based on the premier's magnanimous spirit as the foundation for our handling of the incident. Now, several comrades in Guangdong and Guangxi who are responsible for military affairs have a slogan, "Military orders can only be unified under the banner of resisting Japan." They use the unification of Germany after the Franco-Prussian War in 1871 as an example, saying that only after winning against a foreign country can unification be completed. They naturally think that this slogan and this statement are very reasonable, but they don't know that they are completely wrong. We can also know that Germany took the customs union of seventeen states in 1834 as an opportunity, and due to the result of the industrial revolution and Bismarck's hard work. Although the country was composed of many federations, the unification of political and military orders had gradually been completed before the war against France. Only by unifying political and military orders first can France be defeated, not by defeating France and then unifying political and military orders. From this, we can see that the unification of military and political orders is a fundamental requirement for foreign resistance. Without unified military and political orders, there can be absolutely no external resistance. Several military authorities in Guangdong and Guangxi, because they do not understand this principle, and at the same time have not thoroughly studied and understood the realistic environment of the country and the world situation, and have not deeply understood our revolutionary position, have taken many wrong actions, creating the current mess. They do not cherish the history of the revolution, which is very painful. However, the party and the country have been greatly affected by this, and the tens of millions of compatriots in Guangdong and Guangxi, the source of our revolution, have especially suffered endless pain. Now that their incident is less than two months old, the people of Guangdong and Guangxi are already living in dire straits. Local soldiers are so reckless in their actions, causing trouble to the country. This is something that all comrades of our party, especially I, who is in charge of military affairs in the central government, cannot but take responsibility for self-reflection. I sincerely believe that my credibility has not been established, causing the country and the people to be in sorrow and pain, and adding another layer of danger and shock. Asking myself, I really feel very sorry and sad. Now that the facts have evolved to this point, on the one hand, we must of course always be based on trustworthiness, righteousness, and peace, and in the spirit of the premier's magnanimity, use all peaceful and political means, hoping that the military authorities in Guangdong and Guangxi can repent and reform, so that the situation can be stabilized again, and the country can have the strength to deal with foreign countries. But on the other hand, we must also have the determination and courage to rectify discipline and maintain unity, take responsibility to quell disorder and stabilize changes, and never abandon the work of quelling internal disorder due to the severity of foreign troubles. We must never, because of concerns about the oppression of foreign troubles, listen to a few local soldiers destroying discipline and acting freely, and everything is done in a perfunctory manner. Everyone must understand that, in terms of revolutionary strategy, precisely because of the oppression of foreign enemies, the central government must first thoroughly eliminate internal disorder. Otherwise, general traitors and bandits will want to take advantage of the enemy, and the country will have no hope of stability and revival. When foreign troubles are serious, if there are traitors and bandits who take advantage of the enemy, the central government should disregard everything and thoroughly clarify the situation in order to achieve the complete success of internal pacification and consolidate the foundation of external resistance. If we look ahead and behind, are timid and fearful, and are afraid of the constraints and interference of foreign forces, and therefore do not dare to rectify domestic affairs, then we will have no way to complete the work of building the country and defending against foreign insults. Then we will no longer be able to talk about revolution. If we want to revolutionize, we cannot be afraid of foreign troubles. If we revolutionaries are afraid of the oppression of imperialists, then we cannot revolutionize at all. For example, fifteen years ago, there were imperialist forces everywhere under our arms in Guangzhou. If we want to look ahead and behind, can we still send troops to the Northern Expedition? Since the revolutionary army vowed to launch the Northern Expedition, it was determined to fight to the end with all warlords and red bandits and traitors who took advantage of the enemy, and all anti-revolutionary elements who had no concept of the country, amidst attacks from both within and without. This spirit of the revolutionary army has always been consistent and fully demonstrated at any time and any place. Now, the reason why we want to use peaceful political methods to resolve domestic problems is absolutely not because of fear of foreign troubles and fear of the danger of being attacked from both within and without, but entirely for the sake of the historical feelings between comrades and the relationship of unity and concentrated strength. In other words, it is for the sake of cherishing the strength of the country, maintaining internal integrity, and demanding the overall awareness and unity, so that everyone can work together in the future to jointly resist foreign insults and revive the country's great cause. Therefore, we must take the spirit of the premier's all-encompassing spirit as our spirit and use peaceful methods as much as possible to resolve the issue, in order to comfort our premier and the spirits of the dead comrades in heaven. Recently, all comrades of the central government, of course, have the same mind and the same reason for solving domestic problems. They have always adhered to the spirit of trustworthiness, righteousness, peace, and all-encompassing spirit, and used peaceful political methods to deal with all chaos. But everyone must know that if a country wants to exist independently in the world, it must maintain the essential elements of building a country in spirit and the discipline of unifying domestic power. If the spirit is not rectified and discipline is not established, the country will become an unorganized and lifeless state. In short, it will not become a country. No matter when, no matter what country, they will want to invade and oppress us, and they will not treat us Chinese as citizens with independent personality. They will treat us Chinese as slaves of a conquered country. If we are only afraid of foreign troubles and disregard discipline, causing the country to lose its spirit, then no matter how big the country is or how many people there are, it will eventually perish. Therefore, when we deal with domestic problems, we must, of course, take both sentiment and reason into consideration, and we cannot completely abandon national law and discipline. Therefore, in sentiment and reason, we must also distinguish between right and wrong, and understand obedience and disobedience. If right and wrong are not distinguished, and obedience and disobedience are not understood, then discipline will not be established, and the country will inevitably perish with it. Therefore, now, when we solve domestic problems, historical prestige and emotion cannot be ignored, and right and wrong, obedience and disobedience, must not be unclear. I hope that all comrades of the central government, in the plenary meeting, will use the spirit of trustworthiness, righteousness, and peace, and the principle of taking both sentiment and reason into account, to study a proper solution to domestic problems, so that our country will forever eliminate the roots of betrayal and division, and achieve true and thorough unity, in order to save the country from danger. This is a bit of my opinion and prestige on state affairs, and I specially offer it to all comrades of the central government for your reference when discussing matters at the meeting.

Regarding the Russian delegation's request that the country's Black Sea fleet be allowed to freely pass through the straits and enter the Mediterranean Sea, the British delegation is no longer firmly opposed. However, it has put forward three other proposals: (1) Adopting a reciprocal approach, that is, if Russian warships enter the Mediterranean Sea from the Black Sea, then countries not bordering the Black Sea should be allowed to send warships of equal tonnage into the Black Sea; (2) Britain still objects to the Russian proposal that warships of all countries be allowed to freely pass through the straits if they are fulfilling obligations under regional mutual assistance pacts. Regarding this point, the compromise proposal jointly put forward by the French and Turkish delegations may also be of no avail; (3) Regarding the issue of whether to abolish the Straits Commission, Turkey, Romania, and Greece all advocate abolishing it, while Britain and France advocate retaining it. However, Britain believes that this matter is not of great importance and will not hinder the progress of the negotiations. (Havas dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>Montreux: After the British delegation expressed its objections to the Russian delegation's proposal that warships of all countries be allowed to freely pass through the straits if they are fulfilling obligations under regional mutual assistance pacts, the French and Turkish delegations immediately jointly put forward a compromise proposal. Because the British delegation needs to consult with the government, it is not convenient to decide its attitude on its own. Therefore, the plenary session of the Montreux Conference, which was scheduled to be held this afternoon, is likely to be postponed. (Havas dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>Montreux: Well-informed sources have recently announced that the Russian and Turkish delegations attending the Montreux Conference have virtually no more differences of opinion. However, there are obvious differences of opinion between Britain and Russia regarding how to fulfill the obligations stipulated in the regional pact within the scope of the future new convention (namely, Article 23 of the British amendment). France is currently making every effort to mediate this. (Havas dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<h3>Britain Agrees to Abolish the Straits Management Committee; Accommodating Turkey's Request</h3>
<p>Montreux: The British representative to the Montreux Conference, Lountel, returned here this morning from London with new instructions. As is generally known, the new instructions are more moderate. Regarding the international committee managing the straits, Britain may accommodate Turkey's request and abolish it. Regarding the issue of the passage of Soviet warships through the Dardanelles Straits in wartime, a compromise solution will also be sought that is acceptable to the Soviet Union (that is, Article 16 of the British draft). The only thing it firmly opposes is the amendment proposed by Russia to Article 23 of the British draft (the content of which is that the Dardanelles and Bosphorus Straits must be closed in wartime, but all warships may freely pass through the straits to implement the various obligations contained in existing or future regional pacts). After Lountel arrived here this morning, in addition to meeting with the French representative Ponsot, he also had talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov. In addition, French Chief Representative Poncet also arrived here at 6:30 p.m. today. Turkish Foreign Minister Rüştü immediately went to visit and discuss the recent developments of the conference.

<h3>Austro-German Amity Agreement; Italian Prime Minister Strongly Supports; Contains a Secret Clause; Austrian Restoration Postponed to Three Years Later</h3>
<p>(Rome) High-ranking officials today praised the newly established Austro-German agreement, the focal point of Prime Minister Li, and will invite citizens to automatically practice using it. The budget also includes an additional 100,000 pounds for secret affairs. The expenses for the revised budget in 1936 totaled 350,000 pounds. (Reuters dispatch on the 14th) Mussolini has actively supported the newly established Austro-German agreement, because its origin was actually the meeting between Mussolini and Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg on June 5th. Mussolini not only approved the agreement, but also made many suggestions to Schuschnigg regarding its content. Therefore, although the agreement does not explicitly state the agreement of Germany and Italy, Germany knows that it has obtained Mussolini's strong support. (National Telegram on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Paris) A correspondent from the Paris Echo in London reports that, according to news from the capital of Yugoslavia, the agreement recently established between Germany and Austria contains a secret clause stipulating that the restoration of the Habsburg dynasty in Austria should be postponed until three years later.

<p>(Vienna) The authorities have not yet begun to release Austrian National Socialists in accordance with the Austro-German agreement. It is said that it will take several weeks to examine the crimes of the National Socialists and distinguish between political prisoners and ordinary criminal offenders. Only political prisoners will be eligible for amnesty. (Reuters dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<h3>Newspaper Commentary; Germany and Italy Echo Each Other</h3>
<p>(Berlin) After the establishment of the Austro-German agreement, the newspapers here unanimously praised it, saying that it was a victory for German diplomacy, and that its international repercussions would be expected. The National Socialist Party's organ, the "Attack" newspaper, stated, "This agreement is a tool to deal with Soviet Russia, and the fate of the Locarno Conference has also been decided from now on." Political figures said that the current international problems are complex and complicated. The best way to solve them is for the countries concerned to directly conclude bilateral non-aggression pacts. This can be clearly demonstrated by the agreement recently established between Germany and Austria. Foreign Ministry officials stated that the Austro-German agreement does not mean the formation of a new group, and the agreements signed between Italy, Austria, and Hungary in 1934 and March of this year will continue to be in effect. In the future, Austria's policy will continue as before, and Germany will also continue to work hard to establish friendly relations with its neighboring countries. (Havas dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Rome) After the establishment of the Austro-German agreement, the Giornale d'Italia here commented, stating that this agreement is actually a prelude to the transformation of Europe "outside the scope of the League of Nations," and this transformation should be based on new principles of international life, which are very different from democratic ideals. The Fascist Labor News stated, "Germany and Italy have the same needs. Their nations are both full of vitality, their political institutions are new and solid, and they have the same interests in maintaining European peace. Now, a new era of active cooperation between the two countries is about to begin. All countries that want to obtain the cooperation of Germany and Austria must first abandon their alliances with other countries." The alliances referred to by the newspaper are the mutual assistance agreement established by the countries along the Mediterranean coast, and the treaties signed by France with several small European countries. According to the newspaper, the former is a plan to resist Italy, while the latter is a tool to resist Germany. (Havas dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<h3>Little Entente Countries Value the Consequences of the Austro-German Agreement; There Is Talk of Germany and Czechoslovakia Concluding a Non-Aggression Pact</h3>
<p>Romanian Capital: After the establishment of the Austro-German agreement, political figures here have recently stated that the countries of the Little Entente, the Little Entente, and the Balkan Entente are carefully examining the consequences that this agreement may produce. It is also said that Romania has always believed that any solution to the Austrian issue should not be detrimental to Germany. This can be seen in the speech delivered by Foreign Minister Titulescu in the Chamber of Deputies on April 4, 1934. However, if Romania's rights are harmed by the Austro-German agreement, the government will definitely protect them with all its strength. According to Titulescu's speech, there is hope for a gradual improvement in the relations between Germany and Austria. This is in line with Romania's consistent policy of cooperation among the countries of Central Europe, but Romania will never participate in any economic or political organization that is aimed at Germany. (Havas dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>Yugoslav Capital: After the establishment of the Austro-German agreement, the Pravda newspaper here commented, stating, "The countries of Europe are maneuvering and forming groups, which is no different from the situation in 1914. However, the current alliance of Germany, Austria, and Italy is even stronger than the Triple Alliance of 1914. This is the difference." (Havas dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) After the establishment of the Austro-German agreement, Czech Minister Meisiel has been summoned back to his country. Some political figures here claim that it is possible that Germany and the Czech Republic will conclude a bilateral non-aggression pact. Meisiel's return to his country may be related to this matter, but it is not certain. (Havas dispatch on the 13th)</p>

<h3>Italian and German General Staffs Conclude Military Agreement; Negotiations in Rome Underway; Used to Offset the Franco-Italian Agreement</h3>
<p>(Paris) Renowned journalist Madame Tabouis recently published a Rome dispatch in the L'Oeuvre newspaper, stating that a German military delegation arrived in Rome a few days ago to hold talks with Italian General Staff personnel and conclude an agreement. Regarding this, semi-official sources believe that General Gamlin of the French Army General Staff signed a military agreement with Italian General Staff personnel in Rome after the Franco-Italian Rome Agreement was concluded on January 7 of last year. Now that Italy has become closer to Germany, it wants to conclude a similar agreement with the German General Staff to offset the original military agreement between France and Italy.

<h3>Italy Refuses to Participate in Locarno Conference; Britain, France, and Belgium Engage in Negotiations; Conference Will Be Postponed Indefinitely</h3>
<p>Brussels: Prime Minister Zealand, in his capacity as convener of the Locarno Conference, sent a letter to Italy requesting that it send representatives to participate. The Italian government has already responded, refusing to participate. Foreign Minister Spaak met with British Ambassador Sir Walvey and French Ambassador Laroque this morning and showed them the Italian reply. (Havas dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to officials here, Italy must meet two conditions: (1) the abolition of the Mediterranean guarantee; (2) Germany must be invited to participate in the Locarno Conference. Only after these conditions are accepted by Britain, Belgium, and France will Italy be prepared to send representatives to attend the conference. (Reuters dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(London) Since the establishment of the Austro-German agreement, and Italy's refusal to participate in the Locarno Conference, the Belgian government is negotiating with Britain and France to prepare to postpone the holding of this conference. This has recently been confirmed by diplomatic sources. (Havas dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(London) The Locarno Powers Conference, scheduled to be held on July 22, is now increasingly likely to be postponed, or even postponed indefinitely. The new situation caused by recent diplomatic developments, and the attitude of Italy towards German participation in the conference, are all considered to be worth reconsidering. France's refusal to allow Germany to participate in the preliminary discussions of the conference may be resolved through talks through ordinary diplomatic channels, so that five countries will be present at the first official meeting of the Locarno Powers Conference. (Reuters dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the date of the Locarno Conference, it is now learned that the British government's view is that the conference is only related to the powers of the Locarno Treaty. Since Germany has occupied the Rhineland, it is no longer a related country. Whether this view can be established depends on the outcome of the diplomatic exchange of views on the future of the conference currently being conducted by Britain, Belgium, and France. (Reuters dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the date of the Locarno Conference, well-informed sources here have recently stated that since Italy has refused to participate in this conference, the original date (July 22) may be postponed, but it is also uncertain. However, Foreign Secretary Eden is currently on vacation. He will return to the capital to resume his duties on Wednesday of this week. At that time, a decision can be made on the issue of whether the conference should be postponed. According to the opinions of political figures and parliamentarians, if the Locarno Conference is indeed postponed, the real reasons will be none other than the following two: (1) Since Italy and Germany are not participating, the participants in the conference will naturally be limited to Britain, France, and Belgium. This is not what Britain wants; (2) At the first meeting of the signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty in March of this year, an agreement was reached stipulating that if Germany remains unyielding, Britain and Italy will permanently guarantee the security of the borders of France and Belgium. If the conference is held abruptly now, the French and Belgian delegations will inevitably mention the aforementioned agreement. This is also something Britain does not want to hear. It is expected that the British government should follow two strategies in the future, namely (1) wait for Italy to change its attitude; (2) try to establish an understanding between Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Belgium. Political figures mostly support the second strategy, believing that it is more advisable to start dealing with various European issues immediately, otherwise, it may be too late after the Austro-German agreement is truly implemented.

<h3>France Celebrates National Day: Military Parade Held, People's Front Makes Large-Scale March, Public Enthusiastic as Never Before</h3>
<p>(Paris) President Lebrun and Premier Léon Blum held a military parade at 9:30 AM this morning to celebrate National Day, which lasted until 11:00 AM. The troops marched in formation, orderly and solemn. People from both the left and right wings cheered in unison to show their respect.

<p>(Paris) Today is National Day. President Lebrun inspected a military parade in front of the Presidential Palace, with Premier Léon Blum standing by his side. It is unprecedented in French history for the President of the French Republic and the Premier from the Socialist Party to jointly review a military parade. The citizens of Paris were enthusiastic, with tricolor national flags flying in the sky. The festive atmosphere can be described as unprecedented, and the order was also well maintained, which is commendable. However, in order to maintain law and order, the authorities dispatched 12,000 police officers to patrol various locations. (Havas News Agency, 14th)</p>

<h3>U.S. Expedites Shipbuilding Program, 30 Ships to Be Completed This Year, Large Floating Dock Constructed at Pearl Harbor</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to a report released by the Navy Department's Bureau of Construction, although the U.S. Navy's shipbuilding program has been accelerated, the construction of 49 of the 78 warships currently under construction is still behind schedule. This is due to the needs of the old National Industrial Recovery Act, shipyard strikes, a shortage of experienced experts, and other difficulties. According to the construction contract, 30 ships should be completed this year, but current investigations show that only 23 ships can be built before the end of the year, and five of them should have been completed last year.

<h3>Japanese Army Minister Eager to Implement New National Defense Plan, 800 Million Yuan Budget for Next Year, Still to Be Negotiated with Financial Authorities</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The new national defense plan drafted by the Japanese Ministry of the Army was submitted by Army Minister Terauchi to the consecutive national policy cabinet meetings held yesterday, requesting the understanding of the cabinet members. The Army Minister has high expectations for the plan, and insists that the items listed in the plan are all the minimum necessary facilities, and insists on implementing it no matter what. However, due to budgetary reasons, it needs to be negotiated with the financial authorities before a decision can be made. The content of the plan is divided into two parts in nature, the first part of the plan has an urgent nature, and must be fully implemented within five or six years from the Showa 12th fiscal year. The contents are (1) Expanding aviation and air defense facilities, with an initial temporary cost of approximately 600 million yuan and a regular cost of 200 million yuan. (2) Replenishing the troops stationed in Manchuria, with an initial temporary cost of 600 million yuan and a regular cost of 150 million yuan. The second part of the plan includes (1) Improving domestic military preparations, requiring an expenditure of 300 million yuan. (2) Preparing combat materials, requiring an expenditure of 100 million yuan, with a period of ten or twelve years, so that the domestic army can generally have excellent machinery and be fully modernized. Therefore, the total amount of the Army's budget for next year will be between 700 million and 800 million yuan. (Hualian News Agency, 14th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Soap Industry Begins Expansion into North China Market</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Seven powerful oil and fat companies that also operate large-scale soap manufacturing, including Godo Yushi, Nippon Chisso, Asahi Denka, Banri Soap, Lion Soap, and Okuyama Soap, will also develop new markets in North China. At the board meeting of the Glycerin Sales Company held at the Osaka Cotton Industry Hall on the 18th, a specific plan will be discussed and decided, and the following two plans will be considered: (1) In the first stage, establish an export joint sales association to implement unified planning, production allocation, and sales control. (2) In the second stage, establish soap manufacturing plants in North China. Therefore, the first stage will be started first, and then the second stage will be moved to, so a soap manufacturing plant will be set up in Tianjin at that time. (Domei News Agency, 14th)</p>
<h3>Heatwave Victims in U.S. Reach 1,300</h3>
<p>Chicago, According to government meteorologist Lloyd here, the moisture-laden clouds scattered across the western part of the drought area yesterday have completely disappeared today, so areas that have not received rain will have to endure the heat for at least a few more days. At the same time, the number of deaths due to heatstroke and drowning across the United States has reached at least 1,325, and Canada has reached 300. Lloyd said that the cool air that was expected to move east yesterday has dissipated in the west, reaching only the Dakotas, Nebraska, and Minnesota. Therefore, only Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, and the Dakotas have had their temperatures lowered by rain, and the amount of rain received is also very small. Today's hope is more pessimistic than Saturday and Sunday, but there may be cool air blowing in from the North Pacific, which may reach the Rocky Mountains on Tuesday, but there is still no hope for the Midwestern states. As for how much effect yesterday's rain had, the U.S. Weather Bureau said that because the areas that received rain were scattered in various places, it was impossible to accurately estimate.

<h3>Spain: Monarchist Leader Murdered, Authorities Arrest Many Fascists</h3>
<p>Madrid: It has been learned that the murder of Sótelo, a major political figure of the Monarchist party, was actually carried out by several people in police uniforms who came to his residence to arrest him early yesterday morning. Sótelo's remains were later found in the river, with knife wounds. When Sótelo's friends heard the news of his arrest, they went to the police chief and the commander of the militia to ask for his release, but both denied any knowledge of the matter. It was not until Sótelo's body was found that it was learned that he had been harmed by radical party thugs disguised as police. It is expected that the Fascist Party and the Monarchist Party will retaliate against each other because of this.</p>
<p>Madrid: In the Sótelo murder case, one captain, four lieutenants, and five members of the assault police team have been arrested as suspects. Last night, a total of 135 members of the Fascist Party were arrested here in connection with the case. Arrests of Fascist Party members are also being carried out in various provinces.

<h3>Hebei Province's Financial Difficulties, Actively Planning Remedies, Province's Treasury Deficit of More Than Eight Million Yuan Annually, Compiling New Budget to Strive for Revenue and Expenditure Equilibrium, Jia Yuzhang Discusses Rectification Plan</h3>
<p>Baoding Correspondence: Song Zheyuan, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, instructed Jia Yuzhang, Director of the Finance Department, to carefully devise remedies for the province's treasury deficit, which amounts to more than eight million yuan annually. He also ordered that revenue and expenditure be balanced when compiling the new budget for the 25th year of the Republic and that no further deficits should occur. After receiving the instructions, Jia immediately invited Zhang Jiyong, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, Wang Jingru, Director of the Department of Construction, Li Jinzao, Director of the Department of Education, Zhang Yunrong, Director of the Security Department, Li Xiantang, Director of the Police Department, and Wei Shuxiang, Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, to discuss ways to balance revenue and expenditure in the new budget for the 25th year of the Republic. Although many discussions were held, no concrete results were achieved. Ways to increase revenue were almost impossible to imagine, so everyone advocated finding ways to reduce expenditure. However, the province had previously implemented staff reductions, salary cuts, and the abolition of redundant agencies many times. This time, if a huge amount of more than eight million yuan is reduced again, it will be extremely difficult. Finally, the Finance Department drafted three principles for reduction and convened the directors of various departments to discuss everything for several days. Although there were many discussions, because the province's treasury deficit was too large, it was necessary to find a way to balance revenue and expenditure. Therefore, after many disputes, it was finally passed. The contents include: Abolishing unimportant agencies, Merging agencies with similar functions, and All public funds of the various departments will be issued at 70% of the original amount. As for which agencies to abolish or merge, the directors of each department still need to plan on their own and separately propose the items and amounts of abolition and merger within their own scope, and then jointly compile them to ensure that the total amount matches. At that time, the budget can be established. Now, the directors of each department feel that this matter is difficult because it is quite troublesome to reduce the budget by a huge amount of eight million yuan.</p>
<p>According to Jia Yuzhang, Director of the Finance Department, "The financial difficulties of this province urgently need to be broken, and the compilation of the new budget is also very troublesome. Although there are many difficulties in this matter, it is necessary to carefully find a solution due to practical needs. Regarding the compilation of the new budget, principles for reduction have already been drafted. As for the extent of the reduction and whether revenue and expenditure can be balanced, it is difficult to predict. I (Jia's self-reference) am now trying my best to seek budget revenue and expenditure balance under the principle of reduction for the province's financial difficulties. In addition, I also plan to formulate several plans to rectify the province's finances and actively implement them at the same time, so as to slightly supplement the province's treasury revenue. Currently, there are about three items being carried out: First, clearing up official property; Second, eliminating the malpractice of contract collection; Third, reforming the new tax collection system. The number of official properties in this province is very large, and the government has no accurate statistics. This time, all county magistrates are ordered to clear up the official properties in each county and at the same time handle the black land promotion, determine land sovereignty, which will not only slightly supplement the province's treasury revenue, but also prepare for future land reporting. As for eliminating the malpractice of contract collection, because the livestock slaughter tax and the two license taxes for wine and tobacco in this province for the 25th year of the Republic are all contracted by the county to select personnel, the intermediaries take the opportunity to engage in fraud during the bidding period, reporting more for less, colluding with contractors, and deliberately suppressing the contract amount in order to enrich themselves. The Finance Department has repeatedly investigated and found this to be true, and has ordered all county magistrates to be fair and abide by the rules, and has dispatched Inspector Ma Ronggui to Dingxing, Fangshan, Liangxiang, Yixian, Wanping, and other counties to conduct on-the-spot investigations to remove the barriers between the people and the government, which has yielded good results. Because Dingxing County's past monthly contracted amount was more than 7,000 yuan, this time Director Ma went and recruited contractors with more than 17,000 yuan. In this way, not only can the government slightly increase revenue, but the contractor can also be free of grievances, and the government and the people both feel convenient. This province has changed the collection system on July 1, implemented new tax rules, and established five district tax collection bureaus in Shijiazhuang, Baoding, Tianjin, Xingtai, and Shulu, which can reduce the operating expenses of the collection office by more than 200,000 yuan each year. All of these are ways for the authorities to raise funds and provide remedies for the financial difficulties of this province, and also to assist in completing the revenue and expenditure balance of the new budget."

<h3>Private Goods Arriving in Jinan in Large Quantities Again, General Inspection Office Helpless, Liu Yuzhe Assaulted and Humiliated by Ronin</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Recently, the number of private goods transported to Jinan in North China has been increasing day by day. Although there is a General Inspection Office for Preventing Smuggling by Road in Jinan, the ronin transporting private goods seem to disregard it, and although those who seize smuggled goods try their best to cope with the situation, they are also helpless. In the past, the results of intercepting entire vehicles and scattered items have all been that the ronin assaulted them, and they were all forcibly taken away. The day before yesterday, another vehicle of private sugar was transported from Tianjin, and it was being prepared to be transferred via Jinan and then to the Jiaoji Railway in the east. After being detained, it is currently under negotiation. At 9:15 AM on the 12th, the Pupu Train No. 305 arrived in Jinan, and more than 400 pieces of private goods, such as white sugar and ramie silk, were transported from Tianjin. After arriving at the station, they were immediately unloaded from the train and piled up on the platform, which made it inconvenient for passengers to get on and off the train. The ronin transporting the private goods immediately transferred the goods to trucks and transported them away. It happened that Liu Yuzhe, a professor at Central University, also took the Train No. 305 from Pingru to Beijing and was taking landscape photos at the station. Unexpectedly, he was spotted by the ronin, who thought he was taking photos of the smuggling situation, and slapped Liu several times in the face. The station police and plainclothes police stepped forward to mediate, but they were also assaulted and humiliated by the ronin. Later, after others tried their best to persuade them, the ronin left dejectedly. After being assaulted and humiliated, Liu Yuzhe had no choice but to board the train and leave Jinan for the south.</p>
<h3>Sluggish Sales of Yellow Disaster Lottery Tickets - Public Welfare Charity Lottery Tickets to Be Discontinued -</h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Hebei Province's Yellow Disaster Lottery Tickets were issued by Yu Xuezhong when he was in charge of the Hebei Provincial Government in the 23rd year of the Republic. They were issued until the twelfth issue, when they were ordered to be suspended and terminated. Last month, the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Council commissioned the Tianjin Public Welfare Charity Lottery Tickets, which were initiated by Xiao Zhenying when he was the Mayor of Tianjin in May of this year, and were issued in Pingjin at the same time as the Yellow Disaster Lottery Tickets. Due to the impact of the recent economic downturn in North China, sales have been sluggish, and the income is barely enough to draw the lottery. The offices of the two lottery tickets felt that they could not support such sales, so they sent people to various provinces and cities to sell them in large quantities. Various places have consulted the Ministry of Finance one after another. The Ministry of Finance replied to various places in an instant, and at the same time ordered the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Council and the Tianjin Municipal Government, because the two lottery tickets had not been approved, and the two lottery tickets have not been discontinued so far. They have expanded their publicity and even used strangely shaped parade advertisements to promote them, but the general public is unwilling to believe them and no one cares about them, which has led to increasingly sluggish lottery ticket sales. Regarding the Tianjin Public Welfare Charity Lottery Tickets, the office has invited the silver and money industry, the Chamber of Commerce, wealthy businessmen, and various groups to request assistance, and each industry is responsible for allocating sales externally, with a minimum of 10,000 yuan in bonuses per month, but all winners should be used as charity funds and should not be collected. In Tianjin, where commerce is declining day by day, most of them are affected by smuggling, and business is in a terrible state. Each month, they are responsible for 10,000 yuan in charity bonuses, and everyone is suffering. When the second phase of charity lottery tickets was issued, only 5,000 yuan was raised from commercial donations for the first time. The third phase of lottery tickets could not be promoted due to the Administrative Yuan's order to ban them. The office felt extremely panicked and recently planned to ask the municipal government to allocate sales to its subordinate agencies. All agencies expressed their opposition when they heard the news. Judging from the above situation, it is feared that the issuance will be stopped.</p>
<h3>Songjiang: First District Training of Jia Chiefs Underway</h3>
<p>The Jia Chiefs of the 20 townships and towns under the jurisdiction of the First District Office of this city have been trained in 33 locations this time. Since it started on the 4th, under the supervision of the inspectors appointed by the county government every day, all have been able to attend except for those who are exempt from training according to their qualifications. On the 14th, Wang Gongyu, the Administrative Inspector of the Third District, accompanied by Shen Zongliang, the secretary of the county government, personally inspected the Jia Chief training venues in Piyun, Fengle, Yuemiao, Yongfeng, and Kuatang, and expressed great satisfaction. The district office convened the 20th district affairs meeting of all the township and town chiefs on the 14th to discuss issues related to the training of Jia Chiefs. During the training period for Jia Chiefs, each Jia Chief is limited to practice household registration surveys, joint guarantee pledges, and other work. The academic and science instructors who are enthusiastic about Jia Chief training are rewarded, and the rewards are forwarded to the county government to show encouragement. Jia Chief training is scheduled for general inspection at 7:00 AM on the 17th, with the principle of full participation, but each township far from the city can send one to five representatives from each training venue to gather at the public stadium at 7:00 AM on this morning. At that time, District Chief Shen Fuyun will present to County Chief Li Leng and request the Administrative Inspector Wang Gongyu to attend and give a speech.</p>
<h3>Kunshan: Please Investigate Excessively Collected Taxes</h3>
<p>The scattered grain households in the various townships of this county have always been collected by the Tu Di Bao (local security officials) and then turned over to the collection office. Since the Tu Di Bao were abolished, the county government has sent political police to collect them in various townships. Last month, a certain political police officer was sent to collect them in the northwest townships. Unexpectedly, the police officer saw that the villagers were easy to deceive and charged each household an extra amount. The villagers paid the money reluctantly because the cost was not much. Later, a certain township chief complained to County Chief Peng, who was extremely angry. After investigating and finding it to be true, the police officer was arrested. Later, a powerful person interceded for him, and the excessively collected amount was handed over, and he was released leniently. Now, the grain households in the Xidun Township of the Fourth District have also been overcharged, so they have successively petitioned the District Chief to forward the case to the county for investigation.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Strictly Investigate Bribery and Release of Drug Offenders</h3>
<p>Gong Liansheng, a patrol officer of the Sixth Precinct of the First Public Security Bureau, received a bribe of 150 yuan on the 21st of last month and released three criminals who were privately transporting drugs. The next day, Chief Gao learned about it and divided 10 yuan to Gong. When Bureau Chief Chen Xijiu and Patrol Officer Zhang Xiansheng learned about the matter, they did not report it to the Public Security Bureau, but instead ordered Officer Gong to cancel the mission. After the matter was disclosed in the newspapers, Director Zhang of the Public Security Bureau was furious and immediately arrested Officer Gong and Chief Gao and other related persons, questioned them about the past, and sent Gong et al. to the Third Section of the Public Security Bureau for questioning on the 14th. They will be sent to the county government for handling tomorrow. County Chief Deng attaches great importance to this case and will personally interrogate them and send them to the Commissioner's Office for handling. The Bureau Chief et al. knew about it but did not report it, which is obviously a cover-up, and will be given appropriate punishment within days. The Public Security Bureau will never announce the truth to the outside world about this case. After a detailed investigation for several days, the details of the case are clear, and the truth of the case can be publicly announced in the near future.</p>
<p>###催追田租这讼案</p>
<p>The Case of Urging and Pursuing Land Rent</p>
<p>Wu County, Xietang and other townships, for the problem of rent collection, farmers have repeatedly rioted due to rent problems, so the county government has successively dealt with them with administrative force, but the problem of rent collection is still ongoing. Recently, with the arrival of the busy farming season, the problem of rent collection has temporarily come to an end. The stubborn tenants detained by the Rent Collection Office have also been released one after another to return to farming. The rent collection offices in various townships have also been closed uniformly, but the color of the rent collection is extremely short, and the general landlords are quite disappointed. Although the rent collection has come to an end, each of the rent houses is still proceeding with the urging of rent through judicial procedures. A landlord, Zhou Chunlin, filed a lawsuit with the court against more than 60 households of tenants, including Ling Songfu, requesting a judgment to repay. The district court announced its judgment on the 14th, and the defendants Ling Songfu, Xu Lanqing, Zhu Yunlong, and other more than 60 households shall repay the outstanding land rent to the plaintiff separately, and the defendants shall bear the litigation costs. There are still a large number of tenants being sued by Qian Ding and others, and the district court is still summoning them. As for the problem of this year's land rent, it is quite important. County Chief Deng has specially proposed six principles and publicly solicits opinions in the newspaper on the 14th for reference.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Silk Factory Strike Ends</h3>
<p>The female workers of 36 silk factories in this county, including Wufeng, Ruichang, Dingsheng, and Yongtai, went on a strike. It is learned that the county government convened representatives from labor and management, Ye Qiaoyun, Wang Baozhen, Xue Zukang, Hua Shaochun, and representatives from the General Labor Union, Sun Xiangfeng, representatives from the County Party Department, Li Xiping, and Chief of the Public Security Bureau, Chen Yuchu, to hold a mediation meeting on labor disputes at the silk factory. At that time, three points were decided: It is forbidden for such situations to occur again in the future, and the agitators will be cracked down on and punished. Work will resume on the 15th, and the factory should start work, and the workers should enter the factory and work with confidence. The conditions proposed by the workers will be resolved by the Party and government after work resumes. Each factory will send two representatives to work out a proper solution with the Industrial Union and the General Labor Union to the Party, government, and capital side. The county government will issue a notice of the decided points to inform everyone. At the same time, the Administrative Commissioner Zang Qifang, in addition to instructing County Chief Long to properly plan to solve the strike, also sent clerk Zhang Zhuoyu to investigate the Ruichang Wufeng Yongsheng and other factories. At that time, the staff of Yongsheng Factory reported the truth of the incident and said that the loss of all the factory's property and sundries was about 19,000 yuan. On the morning of the 14th, the female workers of each factory were still on strike. The Silk Factory Industry Union specially sent more than ten cadres to persuade the leaders of the workers in each factory to abide by the mediation principles of the county chief, to resume work uniformly on the 15th, and to inform all workers. Currently, the workers have decided to resume work on the morning of the 15th and wait for the Party and government to handle the matter fairly. The strike has come to an end.</p>
<h3>Silkworm Field Goes on Strike Again</h3>
<p>In the Jiangsu Provincial Silkworm Experiment Field outside the west gate of this county, there are more than 100 male and female workers who work busily every day and rarely rest. Recently, the field suddenly extended working hours, abolished the Sunday system, and did not allow leave. More than 40 female workers felt quite painful about this. On the 11th of this month, they asked Field Director Jiang Shiqi to shorten working hours and restore Sundays, but there was no satisfactory result at that time. The next day, all the female workers in the field automatically went on strike and stopped working. The field director immediately recruited more than 40 new female workers to enter the field to fill the vacancies. The striking female workers learned about this and went to the experiment field to negotiate. At that time, Wang Wei, the director of the Fourth Public Security Bureau in charge, led the police to suppress them. The female workers sent representatives Gu Jingyan, Shan Jinyun, etc., to the General Labor Union to petition and request relief. The union sent a cadre, Zhou Zini, to mediate, but the field insisted on its own opinion, so the mediation was unsuccessful. Currently, the female workers who have been suspended from the field have petitioned the Construction Department and the Silkworm Industry Improvement Association, requesting relief in order to maintain their livelihoods.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin: Postal Officer Steals Remittance Money</h3>
<p>Wang Ziyuan, a postal officer in the registered mail section of the Postal Bureau in this county, who came from Yizheng and was transferred to Chengjiang, has been there for nearly two years. Recently, he was discovered by Director Jiao for privately opening registered letters and stealing remittance money. He reported it to the Jiangsu-Anhui Postal Administration. He was detained by the county on the 12th and interrogated and verified for handling.</p>
<h3>Liuhe: Decision on Flood Prevention Measures</h3>
<p>Regarding flood prevention matters in this county, after the county government received orders from the provincial departments, it immediately convened the chiefs of the Third and Fourth Districts along the river to the county government to discuss all implementation measures and first organized a patrol team to be responsible for patrolling. All flood prevention work should be handled by the heads of each township. The county government also ordered Wang Daoping, the director of the responsible department, to go to supervise the handling of matters to avoid any negligence.</p>
<h3>Danyang: Murder Case Occurs in Xuxiang Village</h3>
<p>Huang Shugeng, a villager of Xuxiang Village in Liuxia Township near Lucheng Town, Fifth District of this county, got into a mutual brawl with his clan uncle Huang Rongsheng on the first day of this month due to some dispute. His arm was stabbed with a knife by Rongsheng, creating a deep wound with blood flowing profusely, almost causing him to faint. After returning home injured, his family asked him about the cause of his injury and who the assailant was. Shugeng firmly refused to disclose anything. He lingered until the tenth day when he suffered from excessive blood loss and his condition worsened. Around 10 PM, he passed away. Only when Shugeng's condition became critical did he reveal that the assailant was Huang Rongsheng. Upon hearing this, his family was extremely distressed and indignant. While arranging the funeral, they reported to the eighth police substation in charge of the area. The police apprehended the assailant. Yesterday, Huang Rongsheng was escorted to the city by the eighth police substation and transferred to the county government for legal proceedings.</p>
<h3>Shaobo: Change of Captain for the Water Patrol Team</h3>
<p>Huang Jinting, the captain of the Shaobo Water Patrol Team, has been reassigned. Hou Zhen has been appointed by his superiors to take over. He assumed his duties on the eleventh. When Captain Huang was departing, the gentry and business communities jointly presented him with a plaque. Approximately several hundred people came to see him off.</p>
<h3>Yuyao: A Tragic Scene in Baisha Township</h3>
<p>Hu Baotian, a resident of Baisha Township, Yuyao, was already sixty years old. His family was well-off. His wife had passed away early, leaving behind a daughter, Xiuying, who was of marriageable age. He recruited a tenant worker, Zhu Genzhang, as his son-in-law. The couple got along very well. However, fortunes changed suddenly, and good times didn't last. At the beginning of the month, Genzhang suddenly developed sores on his abdomen, which ulcerated severely. He groaned in bed, suffering intensely. Xiuying, deeply concerned for her husband, was misled by others who said that licking the rotten flesh could cure him. Therefore, disregarding the filth and poison, she frequently licked Genzhang's festering sores, causing the poison to attack her heart. Both of them died one after another. Baotian, facing such a tragedy in his later years, suffered a severe nervous shock. He cried out all day long. Unexpectedly, he also passed away due to phlegm obstruction. As a result, three corpses were left in the house, with no one to arrange the funeral. It is truly a tragic scene in the world.</p>
<h3>Ningbo: Bandit Activities in Xiangshan Re-emerge</h3>
<p>After the Ningbo Public Security Bureau dispatched a team to suppress the bandits in Xiangshan, the bandit activities had been diminished. However, recently, due to the failure of Shen Heming's gang to surrender, the banditry has reignited. The bandits have many informants and flee east and west, so the main bandit has not been captured. As a result, the Daken area in western Xiangshan has received five letters of extortion from bandits. Recently, Captain Lai's bandit suppression team burned down the bandit nest in Aosha. They also went to Qidong to encircle and suppress the bandits, rescuing a seven-year-old hostage from Aosha, Fenghua. However, the bandit scourge is spreading, and it may be difficult to completely eradicate it in a short period of time.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing: Verdict on the Town Mayor's Embezzlement Case</h3>
<p>Zhu Jipan, the mayor of Wangdian Town, Jiaxing, was accused of falsely reporting expenses and embezzling public funds. Jiang Hengfu, the former mayor, and Feng Rixuan, the committee member in charge of Baojia expenses, investigated and reported the case to the county government. The county government verified the facts and transferred the case to the court for handling. After an investigation by the prosecutor's office, it was determined that there was sufficient evidence of guilt, and a public prosecution was initiated on charges of embezzlement. The criminal court has held a trial. Zhu Jipan hired lawyer Gu Shaojun to appear in court to defend him. Regarding the accusations, he claimed errors due to being busy. After legal debate, the case was announced yesterday. The main text of the judgment stated that Zhu Jipan was found guilty of embezzling public property and sentenced to one year of imprisonment with a two-year reprieve.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Melon Farmers Stop Steamers to Protect Levees</h3>
<p>The people of the Bali Pu to Yangzi Bridge area in the second district of Jiangdu, due to the overflowing Mei flood, gathered on both banks yesterday (the twelfth) afternoon, holding bricks and stones to stop passing merchant steamers from sailing directly, to avoid damaging the levees. The Zhenjiang-Huai'an route steamers of Yangzi, Litong, Zhentong, and Fuyun companies, as well as the freight transport steamers of the Ministry of Railways, and more than twenty tugboats, were detained in the river. A Tiantai-Tongchun steamer heading to Zhenjiang happened to pass by. The driver recklessly sped by with a small engine, risking danger, with bricks and stones flying from both banks. Fortunately, none hit. Other departing steamers, with the help of a chief of staff from a certain division among the passengers, and passenger representatives, pleaded their difficult situation, so they were allowed to be towed away. However, it was said that the detention lasted for five hours. Among the passengers, some lacked travel expenses, or were delayed and missed appointments, and were in a state of urgency and tears.</p>
<h3>Anxi Mining Exploration Concludes; Reserves Only 10 Million Tons; Japanese Technicians Already Dismissed; Future Mining Undecided</h3>
<p>A correspondent from Xiamen reports that the Anxi Pantian coal mine, famous internationally, had the provincial government's Department of Construction organize the Anxi Iron Ore Exploration Project Office, appointing Zhao Xiujin as the director and hiring seventeen Japanese technicians from the South Manchuria Railway Company. Together with technicians from the Construction Department, they formed an exploration team to prospect in Anxi. They divided their work into four sections: railway, harbor, mining, and trial drilling. The railway, mining, and harbor work had been completed earlier. However, the trial drilling work required eight months because they needed to use a diamond drill to drill deep holes of 200 meters to extract iron sand, chemically test the mineral quality, and explore the reserves. Originally, a total of five holes were planned to be drilled. By June, three holes had been drilled. The mineral quality was still good, with an average iron content of over 50%. However, the quantity was not large. In June, banditry suddenly erupted in Anxi. Lü Zhenshan disrupted the mining area, occupied Taozhou, and once besieged Pantian. The Fifth Security Regiment defended for three days, relying on the Ninth Division Xie Brigade to lift the siege. As a result, the provincial government ordered the cessation of exploration. The remaining three Japanese trial drilling technicians were also dismissed. The borrowed Manchuria Railway drilling machine was transported to Jimei by fifteen trucks on the tenth and will arrive in Xiamen on the twelfth. Japanese chief technician Murakoshi Kikuzo also flew from Shanghai to Xiamen on the seventh to wait for inspection and recovery before being shipped to Dalian and returned to the South Manchuria Railway Company. According to Chen Gao, a technician from the Construction Department, "The Pantian mining area in Anxi is plagued by bandits, and the exploration work was hindered and suspended. However, although the trial drilling has not been completed in the past six months, the overall situation of the reserves has become clear. In terms of quantity, there are only about 10 million tons, not the huge 80 million tons. This April, Xie Jiarong, an expert from the Beijing Geological Institute, went to Pantian to survey the ore outcrops and also estimated 10 million tons. Whether to mine in the future is still undecided. However, transportation is difficult, and the investment in railways and ports is too large. The exploration cost this time is estimated at 120,000 to 130,000 yuan." It is said that the estimated cost of all equipment for the development of the Pantian mining area is 20 million yuan, but the quantity is only 10 million tons, so there may be no value in mining. Moreover, Fujian has no anthracite coal and cannot smelt steel. Even if it is mined, it will only be sold as iron sand to foreigners. (July 12)</p>
<h3>A Good Story from the Southern Inspection Tour</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Shi Ying</p>
<p>Lanxi Experimental County</p>
<p>Lanxi has the Qu Port (where rivers are called ports) and Wu Port, which converge outside the city to form the Lan Port, flowing downstream directly into the Qiantang River. Before the completion of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, it was the only route for counties such as Lishui and Quzhou, as well as the provinces of Fujian and Jiangxi, to go north to Shanghai and Hangzhou. It has always enjoyed the reputation of "a thoroughfare connecting seven provinces," holding the core of the commercial area in the mountainous region of eastern Zhejiang. The urban area gathers merchants from all over, and the market is very prosperous and lively. The lives of ordinary people are also relatively well-off. Since the construction of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Road and the subsequent opening of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the commercial center has gradually shifted elsewhere. Jinhua, located in the middle of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Road, was originally Lanxi's neighbor. A branch road was built to give Jinhua an advantage in land transportation. There used to be a saying, "The Jinan government is small, but the Lanxi county is big." Now it has changed somewhat.</p>
<p>Lanxi and Jinhua are interconnected, with similar customs, and can be called "sister counties." For example, people only know that Jinhua's ham is delicious, but they don't know that most of the pigs are raised in Lanxi. Lanxi's fine dates are very sweet and sell well, but the date production area is far away in Jinhua. Lanxi's unique and interesting teahouses first created the fashion of "tea girls." The Jinhua tea gardens, not wanting to be left behind, have also begun to hire glamorous singers. In the past, officials who had served in the Jinhua government still wanted to serve as magistrates in Lanxi County. Conversely, those who had served in Lanxi County wanted to be transferred to the Jinhua government. The former was thinking about their pockets, while the latter was holding their red hats and wanting to take a step closer to a higher position. Although the government has now abolished the Jinhua government and established counties, Lanxi has stationed a top-ranking inspector and concurrently serving as the county magistrate of the experimental county. The political mission it bears is much greater than that of the former government officials. Moreover, "things in the world never come singly." The current magistrate of Jinhua County happens to be an outstanding subordinate of the Lanxi County government, who was promoted over the clouds. No wonder the political effectiveness of these two "sister counties" shows special progress compared to other places.</p>
<p>Before the center of transportation shifted elsewhere, the boats crowded in the port every night often blocked the heart of the river. Just five years ago, the transportation companies were still very developed. The water merchants sent by the major rice shops in Shanghai and Hangzhou to buy rice here usually numbered fifty to sixty people. Now, many transportation companies have closed their doors invisibly, and the water merchants who regularly reside in Lanxi are no more than a few people. The old tycoons of Guanxi were almost all in the ham and medicinal materials industries. Currently, the ham industry is affected by the ham companies in northern Jiangsu. The medicinal materials industry is even more declining due to the increasing popularity of Western medicine. The number of people buying expensive deer antlers and weighing ginseng has become scarce. Therefore, both of these businesses are suffering from chronic diseases. The rural economy is also in decline. The things that ordinary people and poor farmers send to the pawnshops are extended from the October deadline to twenty-four months, but no one goes to redeem them. The extension is not due to the pawnshops' generosity but because the clothing shops that consume the pawned clothes have not encountered customers with "ten thousand strings of cash." The main reasons for this are the "January 28th Shanghai Incident," "the opening of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Road," and the "drought of the 23rd year." Since last autumn, the slight increase in grain prices, especially the increase in tung oil prices, has indeed provided some relief to the rice and oil-producing rural areas. If the grain price can consistently maintain a price of three to four yuan per picul, then the Lanxi market, which has gradually shown signs of recovery this summer, will not be difficult to embark on a prosperous road to a moderately prosperous society.</p>
<p>Hu Ciwei, the magistrate of Lanxi Experimental County, was originally a cadre instructor at the Central Political Science School. The reason why he was transferred here to be the magistrate was accompanied by the task of cultivating experimental political talents. All graduates of the Central Political School, whose studies are similar to the nature of county-level administration, must first come here for practical training (about two months) before being assigned to actual work. Since the experimental county government bears this mission, it pays special attention to local political facilities and wants to make it a progressive and rational model county. This goes without saying.</p>
<p>Hu, as a scholar, left school to serve as the magistrate. He has done several things in a decisive manner, causing the people to feel a sense of fear. Lanxi has developed water and land transportation, with people from all directions. Many people are addicted to red pills. The annual leakage of expenditure on buying drugs is estimated to be no less than hundreds of thousands of yuan. Although the government has issued orders to ban it, the cases are handled by the court. The wealthy are fined one thousand or eight hundred yuan to supplement the court's expenses. The poor cannot be imprisoned for a long time and fed with food rations, which makes the situation even worse, with no achievements at all. In the 23rd year of the Republic, drug offenders were handed over to the county government for handling. Hu began with strict enforcement and successively executed seventeen or eight drug offenders. Among them, an eighty-three-year-old woman also lost her life due to drug trafficking. Everyone realized that the law was inexorable and had a sense of caution. Not only have the cases of drug trafficking and drug use gradually disappeared, but also the petty thieves who have associated with them have disappeared.</p>
<p>There is also a kind of local ruffian force here, which is also a semi-public secret organization that arbitrarily moves flowers and grafts trees, falsely setting penalty clauses, and heavily exploiting merchants. Merchants from other places have suffered from their losses. They say, "It is difficult for evil dragons to fight local snakes," and they can only swallow their anger like a mute eating coptis. Hu learned the details and silently designed to capture four or five of their leaders and send them to Hangzhou, where they are still confined. In this way, he naturally won the applause of the merchants.</p>
<p>The day the reporter arrived in Lanxi from Jinhua, it was raining heavily. A city gate called "Yuyue Gate" was flooded a foot deep. In a place where passers-by gathered to take shelter from the rain, I unintentionally talked to the common people about the political situation of this experimental county magistrate. In addition to complimenting him for his ability, some said that he was too strict. If the common people owed grain or money, regardless of landlords or poor farmers, someone with a gun would immediately come to chase them to the county government to live in a house without money. Therefore, in the past, only 50-60% of the grain tax was collected each year. This county magistrate has been able to collect 100% in recent years. The person who spoke these words also stuck out his tongue at the end to supplement the lack of tone. Originally, the so-called good governance in ancient times should consider both law, order and human feelings. The collection of land tax everywhere, as long as it is not arbitrary taxation, and can be taken from the people and used for the people, is of course beyond reproach. However, for the impoverished farmers who have experienced natural disasters and man-made disasters, in order to avoid the loss of killing the goose for eggs, it may not be a way to cultivate the people's morale.</p>
<p>Visiting Magistrate Hu at the county government, Hu came out to meet me. In addition to general conversation, he also talked about some of his feelings after becoming an official. One thing is worth noting. He said that the common people are originally very good, but the government has lost credibility and is too sorry for them. The so-called "water can carry a boat, but it can also capsize it," and the future is very dangerous. Last time, there was a severe drought in Lanxi. The county government organized a food loan cooperative to provide relief, lending without interest and repaying after the autumn harvest. But the disaster victims were like birds frightened by the bow, preferring to starve rather than easily accept food. Finally, when they were on the verge of starvation, they gradually came to borrow food. However, there were still words like "supporting the county government to earn interest." Later, when the county government actually did not charge interest, it regained its credibility. Even such food loan relief is not easy to gain the trust of the people. If a larger people's power is needed, wouldn't it be even more difficult? What Hu said is true. For example, Zhejiang once conducted a land declaration a few years ago, which cost 4 million yuan. Lanxi County alone was assigned 100,000 yuan, but the declaration yielded no results. Later, in fact, it was necessary to conduct another investigation, touching the people's sore spots, and naturally there would be resentment. For example, in recent years, the requisition of civilian land and fields to build roads and railways was said to be compensated in advance, but in reality, it was just empty talk. Therefore, this time, the counties have raised money for aviation birthday celebrations. Huang Ming, the county magistrate, is cautious and careful, which is very right. Because China is in a period of serious national crisis, on the one hand, material construction and national defense construction are, of course, very urgent, but on the other hand, cultivating the people's strength and cultivating the people's hearts are also equally fundamental plans. If the foundation of the fundamental plan has not been built firmly, then all other material suggestions will naturally not be easy to be as stable as a rock.</p>
<p>Lanxi has many mountains and few plains, so there is a shortage of arable land. The average arable land per capita is only two mu, so life is felt to be insufficient. The average utilization rate has reached 99%, and there is very little hope of expanding arable land. Moreover, according to general observation, tenants account for 80% of the total number of farmers, and land rights tend to be concentrated in the hands of a few people. Since the county was reformed as an experiment, after rectifying public security, it has been engaged in land investigation. The county government has paid attention to the research on improving agricultural affairs, reorganizing arable land, supporting owner-farmers, and making land use economical and increasing its productivity.</p>

<h3>Five Months of Chinese Goods Exported to the US</h3>
<p>The US Consulate General in Shanghai announced the statistics for Chinese exports to the US in the first five months of this year, totaling US$35,636,877, with May accounting for US$6,963,322. However, silver shipped to the US in recent months has not been included in the statistics. Among the exports in the five months, hides and manufactured goods accounted for the most, totaling US$11,211,796. Plant-based foods and beverages, including peanut oil, totaled US$2,216,786. Non-plant-based foods, such as sesame, tung oil, and sesame seeds, totaled US$13,568,087. Textiles, including wool for carpets and embroidered cloth, totaled US$5,683,691. Although the demand for firecrackers this year was not large, it was more than last year, totaling US$234,372.</p>
<h3>Increased Tax on Salt in Shanghai, Nanhui, Chuansha, and Other Counties; Increase to Seven Yuan and Two Jiao</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government has approved the letter from the Songjiang Audit Branch of the Songjiang Salt Transport Deputy Commissioner's Office, which stated that it had received instructions from the Ministry of Finance, which stated that the land in Shanghai, Nanhui, Chuansha, and other counties, as well as Baoshan's Jie Yi and Jie Jiu, was designated as reduced land because private salt supervision was rampant. The tax rate was very light, far from the tax rate for soy sauce workshops. The Ministry has twice increased the light tax on edible salt by one yuan and seven jiao, but it is still one yuan and six jiao less than the soy sauce tax. Since soy sauce and food salt are in the same place, it is inevitable that soy sauce workshops will not purchase salt tax. According to the request of the Audit Office, the tax rate for reduced land in Shanghai, Nanhui, Chuansha, and Baoshan's Jie Yi and Jie Jiu should be increased by one yuan and six jiao per dan, which is equal to the tax rate in the inland areas and can be approved. However, the miscellaneous expenses for soy sauce salt are more than one yuan more than those for reduced land, so how to balance this should be ordered separately. It is ordered that the Deputy Commissioner immediately comply and increase the tax rate for reduced land in Shanghai (including the concessions), Nanhui, Chuansha, and Baoshan's Jie Yi and Jie Jiu from five yuan and six jiao to seven yuan and two jiao from the date of the order. All salt in transit should be investigated and uniformly supplemented. Therefore, it is ordered that this should be complied with. The county government has already issued a notice to inform everyone.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Public Security Bureau Orders a Strict Search for the Murderer in the Xuan Sheng Case, Sternly Directing Subordinates to Extend the Deadline by Three Days, Promising Strict Punishment if the Case is Not Solved</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency reporter inquired yesterday at the Public Security Bureau about the investigation and pursuit of the murderer in the case involving the murdered Japanese resident. According to the official in charge of the bureau, after the case occurred, he immediately issued strict orders to his subordinates to solve the case within three days. He also selected capable personnel from within the bureau to form a special investigation team dedicated to handling the investigation and pursuit of the murderer in this case. The detectives in various branches and offices were reassigned to focus on collecting evidence related to this case. For days, the bureau's internal and external staff have been working around the clock, sparing no effort in handling this case. Although several leads have been obtained, the results of the interrogations have not yet led to a conclusive determination. The investigation is still ongoing. Yesterday, as the deadline expired, a reward of 2,000 yuan was offered for the arrest of the murderer, in the hope of discovering other clues and solving the case as soon as possible. At the same time, subordinates were sternly ordered to extend the deadline by three days, promising strict punishment if the case is not solved. The special task force, investigation unit, and detective brigade within the bureau, all detective personnel, after receiving orders, were fully mobilized. Liang Fuchu, the chief of the North Railway Station branch, after receiving orders, immediately convened all the heads of the offices to discuss methods for solving the case, encouraging his subordinates to risk their lives to solve this case, regardless of the consequences. Currently, work within and outside the bureau is exceptionally tense, and senior cadres are especially concentrating their efforts on dealing with this case. Although the extreme heat is making them quite fatigued, everyone is still working hard and showing no signs of weariness. It is expected that the case will be solved soon to fulfill their responsibilities. Regarding the protection of Japanese residents, the bureau has withdrawn the centralized training and increased police force in areas where Japanese residents live, deploying more patrol officers and patrol units to conduct close inspections at all times. It is also closely coordinating protection efforts with the police departments of the two concessions and the Japanese police.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau issued Public Notice No. 13 yesterday, stating: "It has been found that on the afternoon of the 10th of this month, at approximately 8:00 PM, in Lane 35, Dixiwei Road and Qimei Road, a Japanese resident named Xuan Sheng Kuangzuo was attacked and killed. The Linping Road Police Station reported this case to the bureau, and the municipal government ordered subordinates to solve the case within three days. Now, according to Dispatch Order No. 19311 from the municipal government, because the perpetrator has not yet been apprehended, the following rewards are offered:</p>
<p>Anyone who leads police detectives to apprehend the principal offender, and whose interrogation confirms the facts, will be rewarded with 2,000 yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>Anyone who provides information leading to the apprehension of the principal offender, and whose interrogation confirms the facts, will be rewarded with 1,000 yuan in national currency."</p>
<p>You are ordered to comply accordingly. This notice is hereby issued for the information of all citizens.</p>

<h3>Ministry Approves Delay in Minting of Two and a Half Cent Subsidiary Coins</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation received instructions from the Ministry of Finance yesterday regarding the additional minting of two-and-a-half-cent subsidiary coins, stating that it should be considered after the old subsidiary coins have been withdrawn to a considerable extent. The original instruction reads: "Replaced General Dai Xi, The Ministry is promoting the new subsidiary coins, on one hand, increasing the number of mints to meet market needs, and on the other hand, examining the situation in various regions, selectively withdrawing and destroying the old subsidiary coins, in order to gradually cultivate people's habit of using new subsidiary coins, thereby avoiding the risk of price gouging. Furthermore, after investigating that merchant groups from Wuxi, Wujin, Jiangyin, and other counties in Jiangsu have repeatedly requested the withdrawal of copper coins that have flooded the market, the Ministry then instructed the three banks to investigate the situation and handle it properly in accordance with the principle of fair value. This shows that the amount of old copper coins in circulation has not decreased, and there is no increase in the hardships of small-scale industry and commerce. The request to add two-and-a-half-cent coins should be considered in the future when the old subsidiary coins have been withdrawn to a considerable extent, and you should inform others of this order."</p>
<h3>Federation of British Industries Plans to Send Chinese Students to Practice Engineering Materials</h3>
<p>A.J. Percival, Chairman of the Selection Committee of the Federation of British Industries, wrote to this newspaper yesterday, stating: "To the Editor of Shen Bao, Two and a half years ago, the Federation of British Industries in London initiated a plan to send Chinese students to the United Kingdom to study engineering. The implementation of this plan has been satisfactory. Since then, twenty-nine Chinese students have benefited from it. Of the eight who have returned to their home countries after completing their studies, most have returned to their original positions, while a few have taken jobs at machinery companies. This student exchange plan is based on the recommendations of the British Far East Economic Mission of 1931, which felt that Chinese students' industrial training in other countries was primarily for the benefit of those countries. The objectives of this plan can be divided into commercial and cultural aspects. Commercially, it provides Chinese students with the opportunity to receive practical training in the United Kingdom, so that upon their return to China, they can use the British engineering knowledge they have acquired to solve China's engineering problems. Culturally, it can promote friendship between China and the United Kingdom. This plan is managed in China by a Selection Committee organized by prominent British engineers in Shanghai. The Federation of British Industries in London regularly informs the Committee of vacancies for internships in British factories. Notices of these vacancies are published in Chinese newspapers and announced at prominent Chinese universities such as the University of Hong Kong. Applications for each vacancy must undergo rigorous scrutiny, and only those who are deemed qualified are recommended to London for a final decision. The strict selection criteria are based on each student's specialized knowledge, experience, character, English proficiency, and physical appearance. Training in British factories involves a balanced rotation through various departments, in order to achieve a comprehensive result.</p>
<p>Scholarships are awarded for one year, and may be extended for another year if the work report is satisfactory. Upon the students' return to China, the Shanghai Selection Committee continues to liaise with them and strives to find them suitable employment, so that they can apply what they have learned. According to observations from participating factories and many nationally renowned companies, the breadth of the selection scope stipulated in this plan cannot be matched by any other approach. Each participating company provides the students with a small weekly stipend, supplemented by scholarships, to ensure that they can live comfortably. British shipping companies and Dutch and German companies also offer reduced fares. The Committee of London Chinese University and the Board of Directors of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund in Nanjing have also provided some support, but the amount is too small to match China's needs and the capabilities of British industry. The Chinese people and government authorities eagerly expect the progress of the Chinese economy to depend heavily on the supply of trained engineers. If you can widely publicize the Federation of British Industries Scholarship Program, so that funds can be raised in the future to prepare for it, any British individuals or organizations who are passionate about the development of commerce and cultural exchange between China and the United Kingdom, whether through monetary or other assistance, would be greatly appreciated. Chairman of the Selection Committee of the Federation of British Industries (A.J. Percival)."</p>
<h3>Takehisa Returns Home Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Chen Bingding Returns to China to Inspect Agriculture, Petitions the Ministry of Industries to Utilize Wasteland for Agricultural Reform</h3>
<p>Chen Bingding, an honorary consultant of the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee and an overseas Chinese from Batavia, Dutch Java, has returned to China to inspect agriculture. Yesterday, he petitioned the Ministry of Industries to utilize wasteland for agricultural reform. The original petition is recorded below:</p>
<p>I respectfully submit that since the Ming Dynasty, the islands of Nanyang have successively become colonies of various Western countries, regarded as inexhaustible treasures. Those who reclaimed mountains and forests were mostly overseas Chinese. However, our government in the past neglected these distant lands and could not assist the East India Company as the British government did to claim its territory. Initially, they devoted themselves to cultivation, but ultimately, like birds hunted after use, it is truly regrettable.</p>
<p>According to historical records, merchants from Guangdong province who went to the Nanyang Islands generally used sailboats to transport large quantities of sugar, tea, dried longan, dried lychee, persimmons, vegetables, utensils, and other goods to sell to the local people. This was the vanguard of our overseas Chinese expanding abroad. Upon returning, they purchased local products such as sea cucumber, shark fin, buffalo horn, buffalo hoof, buffalo bone, bird's nest, rhinoceros horn, bear bile, ivory, black and white pepper, and other medicinal materials and miscellaneous goods to sell in China.</p>
<p>Taking Java as an example, the traces of our people's pioneering efforts have a history of over six hundred years. Three hundred and twelve years ago, the Dutch government, to develop Java's commerce, sent General Pieterzoon Coen to conquer Batavia. After a considerable time, he did not succeed and sought assistance from Mr. Su Mingwang, an overseas Chinese (originally from Tong'an, Fujian, who operated an oil mill in Banten). Mr. Su selected 500 elite overseas Chinese to assist, and they succeeded in conquering the local people. The Dutch East India Company appointed Mr. Su as Kapitan (captain). From then on, more and more Chinese people went to Nanyang. At that time, the Dutch territories were desolate, roads were not built, vegetation was dense, and animals roamed freely. Our overseas Chinese, for the sake of livelihood, did not fear hardship and went straight ahead, guiding the locals on how to reclaim land and how to plant crops. Thus, what was once useless land gradually became a source of wealth.</p>
<p>In the last hundred years or so, science has flourished, and Western production technology is useless in China. In addition, the Dutch government selected and dispatched specialists to dedicate themselves to guidance, resulting in significant achievements. For example, using machinery for manufacturing and improving the selection of varieties have greatly increased yields. Previously, Java needed to import sugar and tea from our country, but now it has become a famous sugar and tea-producing region in the world. The speed of its progress is truly astonishing. Other products, such as coconuts, rubber, black and white pepper, corn, citronella oil, coffee, tapioca starch, sago flour, kerosene, electric oil, and tin mines, also have large outputs. Various fruits not only meet the needs of the more than sixty million people in the Dutch territories but can also be transported abroad for sale. The above only mentions the most prosperous and largest industries; there are many other local products with considerable quantities, too numerous to list.</p>
<p>If production is abundant, then financial resources are sufficient, and all administrative affairs can be improved. Today, people from various countries who visit this place cannot help but marvel at it as a paradise. Examining the reasons for this achievement, our overseas Chinese have played a significant role. These overseas Chinese occupy an important position in the Dutch islands. Many operate large, medium, and small stores, and there are also many who engage in agricultural land, real estate, and factories for firewood, rice, coconut oil, citronella oil, tapioca starch, sago flour, and rubber. However, the majority are laborers. Previously, the locals were lazy, lacked knowledge, and lived simple lives, causing various industries to lag behind. With the hard work and dedication of our overseas Chinese, they have been able to excel.</p>
<p>However, since 1912, the Dutch government has vigorously established schools in various cities and villages, and the knowledge of the locals has gradually increased, competing with our overseas Chinese in the marketplace. The businesses we operate have not been as prosperous as before. In addition, the impact of the global economic depression of 1929 and the aggressive southward policy of the Japanese have increasingly shaken the inherent position of our overseas Chinese and brought them to a dangerous situation. In recent years, the prices of various local products have plummeted, and the social economy has deteriorated to the extreme. The assets of our overseas Chinese have suffered a loss of seventy to eighty percent. If this situation is not changed, our overseas Chinese will have no foothold in the Dutch territories.</p>
<p>It is estimated that there are about 1.3 million overseas Chinese in that territory. Those who have relatives to rely on can barely survive, while those who have nowhere to live have uncertain futures, drifting overseas in a miserable state. Recently, there have been restrictions on entry and various harsh taxes, making it difficult for newcomers to gain a foothold. If there are no relief measures, in a few decades, overseas Chinese will disappear from the Dutch territories.</p>
<p>I humbly remember that Sun Yat-sen and the leaders of the Party and the country have called overseas Chinese the "mother of the revolution," and that relief efforts are one of the policies. They should not bear to sit idly by and do nothing. Although there are now "Overseas Chinese Happy Villages" and subsidies for overseas Chinese school fees, these are mere drops in the bucket and do not solve the problem. Compassion is in everyone's heart, and especially for compatriots of the same country and ethnicity, there must be a special deep affection. Leaders of the Party and the country take it as their responsibility to relieve hunger and save the drowning. There is no need for overseas Chinese to appeal. However, momentary foolishness is enough to serve as a reference for making policies and should not be rejected by the wise.</p>
<p>I humbly believe that to solve this difficult problem, there is no other way than to promote planting, relieve rural areas, and revitalize industry. In recent years, the central and local governments have implemented policies for promoting planting, but the results have been minimal. Why is this the case? It is because the majority of the people do not understand the benefits of planting, and their minds are stubborn and superstitious about feng shui. Hence, there is a saying, "If there is a barren mountain, no one will cultivate it; if cultivation begins, there will be disputes!" As such, those who are enthusiastic about developing industries are hindered and cannot proceed as they wish.</p>
<p>Looking at Taiwan, which used to belong to our country, production was very low. But when it was occupied by the Japanese, its government vigorously promoted agriculture. Over the decades, local products have progressed almost overnight. The export value of bananas alone is over 12 million yuan per year. Other major products can be seen from this. Given the vastness of our country's territory, if our government can issue a clear decree to designate all wasteland in various provinces and force planting within a specified time, then in a few years, barren mountains and vast wilderness will all become areas of production.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our country has traditionally been an agricultural nation, but in recent years, food has been insufficient, and imports from overseas reach tens of millions annually. If such wasteland is utilized, in addition to rice and wheat, the widespread planting of millet (upland rice) and cassava will also greatly benefit the people's food supply.</p>
<p>Regarding the above points, our government may worry about financial constraints and be unable to proceed as scheduled. However, if it can establish a protection clause to ensure the safety of their capital, overseas Chinese will also be happy to use it. In this way, overseas Chinese will start businesses, enriching the people and the country, achieving multiple benefits in one fell swoop. The leaders of our government should not dismiss these words as trivial.</p>
<p>I, Chen Bingding, have personally felt that the above is complex and should be carefully examined and implemented.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously inquired with the Ministry of Finance about the stamping method for invoices with receipt properties. Yesterday, the Ministry of Finance replied: The attached telegram from Jiangsu is acknowledged. The total amount listed on the delivery note is the amount receivable for the goods. If the note has "received national currency" or "received" marked on it, it indicates that the amount receivable for the goods has been received. The amount received and the amount receivable are one item, not two separate amounts. Therefore, it is not possible to combine the amount receivable and the amount received and forcibly affix stamps based on the combined amount. As for invoices that also function as receipts, since the tax rates are the same, according to Article 8 of the Stamp Tax Law, it is only necessary to affix stamps for one type of voucher. If the inspectors of Liyang County forcibly affix stamps based on the combined amount of received and receivable, it is wrong. Please request the Jiangsu Provincial Government to instruct the county government to investigate and correct this error. This is the approval.</p>

<h3>Gang Fight Among Car Workers, Zhou Kailong's Injuries are the Most Serious</h3>
<p>At 3:20 am yesterday, a dispute over business among cargo car workers on Taopeng Road in Yangshupu led to a gathering of dozens of people on both sides, each armed with iron rods, knives, and axes for a major brawl. As a result, three people on one side were injured: Jin You from Ningbo, Zhou Kailong from Yangzhou, and Hu Shikun from Shaoxing. All three were cut and beaten and collapsed to the ground, barely breathing. Upon receiving the report, the Yulin Road police station dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to the scene to arrest the perpetrators. The brawlers on both sides took advantage of the opportunity to scatter. Subsequently, four suspects were apprehended: Li Kui from Nanjing and Kang Youfa from Ningbo, and brought to the police station. The injured, Jin, Zhou, and Hu, were transported to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment. Jin Jiayou suffered head injuries and was bandaged by the doctor.

Judge Zhong Qing, after questioning Jin Jiayou, who testified that Li and Kang were at the scene, ordered them to be remanded in custody, and the date was changed for investigation and verification.</p>

<h3>Female Hospitality Worker Swindled, Zhu Chunrong Detained</h3>
<p>Shen Ajin, a 24-year-old girl from Huzhou, works as a female hospitality worker at the amusement park of the Great World. She is somewhat attractive. Three months ago, she met Zhu Chunrong from Zhenjiang, who claimed to be the owner of the Dahua Leather Shoe Store. She was seduced by him, and they rented a room to live together in a pavilion room near Xiaoximen in the South City. However, at that time, Zhu stated that he had no money, so Shen advanced the money and purchased furniture worth more than 20 yuan. Since living together for two months, he then completely swindled away the girl's furniture and clothes and pawned them for his own use. He then took the opportunity to sneak back to Zhenjiang to hide. When Shen discovered this, she could not pursue him. She could only lament her fate, and suppressed her feelings without revealing. But she still secretly investigated. At 7 pm the day before yesterday, Shen happened to meet Zhu on the road in Xiaoximen. She grabbed him firmly, insisting that Zhu Chunrong return all the items. Unexpectedly, Zhu denied the matter and punched and kicked the girl, tearing her clothes. The police officer at post number 24 saw this and brought both parties to the Wenmiao Road Police Station. Section Chief Wen learned of the incident and prepared a document to send to the General Bureau for handling as the case involved a cohabitation dispute.</p>
<h3>Recruiting Shop Turns Out to be a Bandit Den, Three Girls Almost Sold</h3>
<p>Around 5 pm the day before yesterday, Zhong Yuting, a guard at the Nanxiang station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Motor Road, discovered five suspicious male and female travelers. After taking them to the bureau, the director of the Zheng Branch Bureau interrogated them. The man claimed to be Hong Yuhe from Yangzhou, who runs a recruiting shop on Tangshan Road in Hongkou, Shanghai. The women were: Lin Jinbao, 25 years old, from Zhenjiang, who runs a barbershop on Gao Langqiao in Shanghai; Li Jinmei, 20 years old, from Tongzhou, who lives in Bada Alley on Yangzhou Road in Shanghai; Wang Sanmei, 20 years old, from Yancheng, who lives in Yangshupu in Shanghai; and Zhao Zhaodi, 18 years old, from Tongzhou, who lives with Li Jinmei. He also claimed that they were deceived by Hong Yuhe and Lin Jinbao on the 14th of the lunar month and initially lived in the Zhongnan Hotel in Shanghai, under the name Wang Weide. On the fourth day, they went to the home of Hong's relative in Zhengjia Muqiao. They only stayed one night because the family saw that their actions were improper and kicked them out. So, from the fifth day, they stayed in the Jiaotong Hotel, and also stayed for three nights. Then they opened the Hongkou Zhongshan Hotel, under the pseudonym Zhang Zaisan. Lin Jinbao also confessed that the three girls were from a yarn factory and he knew it. Hong Yuhe asked me to lead them out to play. When opening the hotel, it was not only Hong alone. Most of the men took turns to sleep with them. Yesterday (the day before yesterday), they took a small train to Nanxiang, intending to transfer to Suzhou. The three girls also said that they were deceived by Lin Jinbao, saying that they would work in the factory, but they were deceived. After checking the confession, Director Zheng believed that the case was criminal and involved the suspicion of obstructing morality and seducing others to leave their families. It was not enough to strictly investigate. So, he specially summoned the families of the three girls yesterday and interrogated them. Around 6 pm yesterday, he took them to the Jiading County Government for interrogation. According to Lin Jinbao's confession, when they were arrested at Nanxiang Station, there was another man named Mao Wanyu who escaped. Mao is the main criminal who designed to deceive the three girls to Suzhou for sale.</p>

<h3>Silver Shop Accused of Receiving Stolen Goods, Acquitted, Part of Yuanzhang Fined</h3>
<p>Qing Fuxing Silver Shop on East-West Huade Road recently purchased a large batch of gold jewelry stolen by Chen Zhiliang, a Cantonese thief. Feng Baishun, a Chinese detective from the Chengdu Road Patrol, and Wang Yongjun, a detective, found out about it. Qian Xunjiu, a lawyer from the Shanghai Municipal Council, filed a public lawsuit against Fu Xingmao, the owner of the silver shop, on charges of receiving stolen goods and violating Article 34 of the Yangjing Hong Charter and Article 5 of the Silver Shop License Charter. The First Special Court has conducted an investigation of the situation. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Fu Lin continued the trial in Criminal Court V. Fu Xingmao arrived in court with his defense lawyer, Jiang Yiping. He submitted account books to prove that the gold jewelry received was not lower than the market price. After being transferred to the court for verification, the lawyers of both parties were asked to debate, and the verdict was announced in court: Fu Xingmao was acquitted of the charge of receiving stolen goods.

The market price is also extremely stable, generally between four yuan and forty-five cents per pound.

<h3>National Goods Association Requests Exemption from Inspection of Domestically Produced Electrical Appliances</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factories Joint Association sent a letter to the Jianghai Customs Superintendent's Office yesterday, stating that according to a letter from its member, the Huatong Electrical Machinery Factory, due to the increasing smuggling activities, the Customs has set up inspection offices at railway stations to inspect incoming and outgoing goods. The factory's products shipped from Shanghai to various locations via the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railways must be inspected and released, which causes delays. Currently, it is the peak season for fan sales, and managers in various ports are in urgent need. They find this procedure quite difficult. Since the factory's products are entirely domestically produced, it requests exemption from inspection. Three copies of the trademark design are enclosed for verification by your association to confirm they are indeed domestic products and request approval for their release. It is noted that the factory specializes in manufacturing AC and DC generators, high and low voltage panels, various automatic oil switches, voltage testers, various electrical appliances for trains, electric furnaces, electric ovens, electric stoves, DC and AC electric fans, and various industrial electrical machinery. Its products are of excellent quality and are operated with domestic capital, which is sufficient to resist the invasion of imported goods. Therefore, protection is necessary. This letter is to certify and request your office to order the railway station inspection office to exempt these goods from inspection to facilitate transportation and safeguard domestic products.</p>

<h3>Patrol Officer Long Jianpo Faces Another Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Patrol Officer Long Jianpo of the Xinchan Branch was previously accused by Wu Xiaosan of Funing of being arrested because Patrol Leader Xue Zheng and Police Officer Wen Shiying, subordinates of Patrol Officer Long, demanded gratuities from the Huayanglou Teahouse and were unsuccessful. Wu Xiaosan intervened and was arrested. He requested that Xue Zheng and Wen Shiying be investigated according to the law. As a result, Xue Zheng was found not guilty, and Wen Shiying was sentenced to 59 days of detention and given a suspended sentence. However, Long Jianpo was not a defendant at the time, but there were letters and testimonies in which Patrol Officer Long assigned police chiefs to solicit gratuities. Therefore, Long believed that he was falsely accused and that his reputation was harmed. He filed a lawsuit with the Prosecutor's Office. Wu Xiaosan was ordered to post bail, and Wu Xiaosan submitted counter-evidence, requesting an investigation into whether shops within the jurisdiction of the Xinchan Branch had been extorted for gratuities. After reviewing the case, Prosecutor Lei Binzhang believed that a thorough investigation was necessary. Therefore, he personally investigated and found that 40 to 50 shops had paid gratuities. He then obtained several account books and, according to his prosecutorial authority, reported the matter. Yesterday, he ordered Long Jianpo to be summoned to court and ordered him to post bail pending investigation. While the Prosecutor's Office was still investigating, Wu Renfu of Funing accused Long Jianpo of abuse of power and illegal detention. He stated that it was related to Wu Xiaosan's case, and because Wu Xiaosan cited him as a witness, Patrol Officer Long held a grudge and used his position and authority to arrest him. He cited Chen Dexing, Wang Zanyao, and Zhang Songlin as witnesses. Yesterday, Judge Li questioned Long, who denied the detention. Lawyer Ji Fenglv, representing the defense, argued that the witnesses had made false statements and requested a confrontation. The judge adjourned the hearing.</p>

<h3>Shanghai North National Goods Exhibition Opens Tomorrow, Presidium Elected Includes Wang Xiaolai, etc., Invitations Sent to Various Circles to Attend</h3>

<h3>Saving Exported Egg Products: International Trade Bureau Considers Measures</h3>
<p>Egg products are a major export from our country, and have become even more significant in recent years. Last year, eggs and egg products ranked third among the major export goods. The main destination for these exports is the United Kingdom, followed by Germany, and then the United States. However, judging from trade trends, the sales in the UK have been declining year by year, as is the case with Germany. Furthermore, Germany has recently implemented economic controls and foreign exchange management, which may further hinder egg product sales. However, the sales in the United States have slightly reversed the downward trend in recent years. Although the eggs and egg products shipped to the United States last year increased by three and a half times compared to the previous year, they are still inferior to those of three or four years ago. However, the market for egg products is primarily based in the United Kingdom and the United States. In recent years, the United Kingdom and the United States have become wary of the activity of our country's egg products and are actively trying to develop their domestic production capacity and restrict the progress of our country's egg products. For example, the United States plans to increase import tariffs, and British merchants are vigorously promoting the poor quality of our country's egg products, advocating a ban on imports or increased taxes to restrict them. Although the British government is mindful of diplomatic relations and has not yet adopted these measures, the British promotion is persistent, and the future is worrying. Even if the British government does not temporarily increase taxes, the sales of our country's egg products may inevitably be affected. This trend can be observed in the reduced export of egg products to the UK in the past two years. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce is paying close attention to this matter. In addition to informing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to instruct ambassadors abroad to pay attention at all times, it has also ordered the International Trade Bureau to actively plan for relief measures. At the same time, the Sino-British Trade Association, jointly formed by the Shanghai British Chamber of Commerce and the China International Trade Association, is also paying attention to this matter in order to promote Sino-British trade. It has discussed and formulated five improvement measures and submitted them to the ministry for assessment. The main points are summarized as follows: Research and Improvement: Representatives from the Egg Industry Association, the Commodity Inspection Bureau, and the Sino-British Trade Association will be elected to form an Egg Products Improvement Committee. Experts will be hired to set up venues to study and promote the improvement of chicken breeds and increase production. At the same time, guidance on feeding and disease prevention will be implemented. In addition to the contributions from the above-mentioned agencies, the government should subsidize a monthly amount, similar to the China United Sericulture Improvement Association. Education and Promotion: This work is currently being carried out by private individuals. The strength is weak, and the effect is naturally small. In the future, publications should be increased, with simple language to describe feeding and disease prevention methods, and spread to the people, so that they know how to improve.</p>
<h3>There Was Thunder and Rain in the City Yesterday, with Thunder and Lightning Lasting for a Long Time Before Stopping. The Rain, Longed For, Greatly Benefits Agriculture.</h3>
<p>According to Datong Du Yun, the weather in this city was the hottest on the 11th since the beginning of summer, with the temperature rising to over 97 degrees. However, starting the next day, it suddenly cooled down again, and the wind blew fiercely all day long. This deep coolness lasted until the night before last. Yesterday morning, the weather gradually warmed up, but around 1 PM, thunder and lightning suddenly occurred, and heavy rain poured down. The thunder stopped at 5 PM, and the rain also stopped. In the evening, the sky was still cloudy and uncertain. Since the beginning of summer this year, the rainfall has been scarce, and the heat has recently been intense, with drought gradually emerging. Farmers are longing for rain, which is extremely urgent. Therefore, yesterday's timely rain greatly benefited agriculture. Propaganda Towards Britain: In order to stop the export of egg products from various countries to the UK, British egg merchants have organized a campaign of destructive propaganda, which has greatly affected the export of Chinese eggs to the UK. Although this propaganda has temporarily stopped in recent years, our country must actively promote our products. The government should publish English pamphlets explaining the cleanliness of Chinese egg factories and the completeness of the inspection work. In addition, the process from chicken raising in rural areas to egg product export should be filmed and screened at gatherings of British civil society organizations. The power of publicity will be great, and the effectiveness can be imagined.</p>
<p>Tax Reductions and Exemptions: Export tariffs in our country are one of the sources of national revenue. In this time of financial difficulty, it is difficult to waive them all. However, it is found that eggs transported from Wuhu to Shanghai have already been taxed. After these eggs arrive in Shanghai, they are converted into liquid, packed, and exported, and the Shanghai Customs still charges export taxes. This system of one goods taxed twice should be changed. In the future, when national tax revenues are slightly more abundant, export taxes should be eliminated to facilitate foreign trade.</p>
<p>Expanded Inspection: In addition to chemical methods to analyze the contents of egg products, the inspection of egg factories is also very important. Currently, the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau only inspects egg factories in Shanghai. Due to the long distance, egg factories in the interior have not been included in the inspection scope. In the future, they should also be subject to inspection, so that it will be more powerful to promote the cleanliness of our country's egg products abroad. After the Ministry of Industry and Commerce accepted the above articles, it ordered the International Trade Bureau to consult with all parties concerned and discuss practical and feasible measures. After the bureau negotiated with all parties, it convened egg manufacturers to study in detail. There has been a clue about the above five items. In the future, the export of egg products will be able to increase a lot of strength. As for the United States, there have also been recent discussions on raising the issue of egg products. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has transferred the issue to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ordering the ambassador to the United States to negotiate properly. The bureau also gathered major egg merchants such as Zheng Paixing, Tang Dingchen, and Wang Xinzai to discuss remedial and coping methods. It is said that there are considerable ways to go.</p>

<h3>Hua Manager Xu Wenliang of Mei Foo Oil Company Kidnapped. Bandits Climbed Over Short Wall, Opened Gate, Drove Car into Garden, Robbed Cash, Foreign Currency, and Jewelry, Then Abducted Xu. Bandits' Fingerprints and Footprints Were All Taken.</h3>
<p>Xu Wenliang, a Cantonese, 40 years old, residing at 1305 Yuyuan Road, is the Hua Manager of Mei Foo Oil Company in this city. At about 2:00 AM yesterday morning, while Xu and his wife were fast asleep, a brown rental car with license number 3067 suddenly came to the front of his residence. Unexpectedly, six or seven bandits were ambushed in the car, wearing white and gray short shirts and pants, and black silk shirts and trousers. As soon as the car stopped in front of the gate, the bandits got out of the car, climbed over the short wall of the gate, removed the door latch from the inside, and opened the gate. One of the bandits drove the car into the garden, then went to knock on the second door, falsely claiming to be a visitor. The servants of the house heard the noise and did not suspect anything, so they opened the door and invited them in. Who knew that everyone was armed? They first shouted at the servants and drove them to a corner to watch. Other bandits rushed upstairs at this time and went to Xu's bedroom. At the same time, Xu and his wife heard chaotic footsteps downstairs and were about to go downstairs to check when they encountered the bandits. Therefore, they were taken captive, forced back into the room, and ordered to open the dresser drawer. First, they robbed more than 400 yuan in cash and foreign currency. At that time, Xu also had relatives, Mrs. Liang and her nephew Xu Chengyuan, in the room. Seeing that Xu's wife and Mrs. Liang were wearing diamond rings on their hands, the bandits insisted on taking them off and put them in their pockets. At that time, the bandits were afraid that someone would come out of the room and shout, so they stuffed everyone in the room with cotton and tied their limbs tightly with hemp ropes, confining them in the room. At the same time, they crowded Xu Wenliang downstairs, pushed him into the car, and fled westward. At that time, those who were confined in the room upstairs suddenly heard a gunshot downstairs, and then it was silent. After the bandits had gone far away, Xu's wife and others were untied by the servants and regained their freedom. They went downstairs to look for Xu Wenliang, but he was nowhere to be found. It was undoubtedly a kidnapping. They immediately telegraphed the Jing'an Temple Police Station to request assistance. The police, upon receiving the report, immediately ordered Chinese and Western detectives to rush to investigate. A pool of blood was found next to the lower steps of the handrail, and a bullet was recovered. Footprints were all over the lawn, and they were taken one by one for tracking. The bullet was also taken back for filing. It was learned that the kidnappers all spoke with a Jiangbei accent. As for the bandit vehicle No. 3067, it was found near Jing'an Temple at about 4:00 AM. There were many fingerprints and footprints left on the car, which were also photographed one by one for filing.</p>

<h3>Salt Merchant Zhou Mingjiu Accused by Widow of Seduction and Abandonment. Plaintiff Requests to Withdraw Complaint, Not Approved. After Trial, Ordered to Settle Out of Court Within Seven Days.</h3>
<p>Zhou Mingjiu, a salt merchant from Anhui residing in Shanghai, 48 years old, residing at No. 12 Lianzhuli, Avenue Edward VII, has recently been accused in the First Special Court by Ouyang Bibo, a widow from Xiangyang, Hunan, through lawyer Peng Jianxun, of criminal charges of seduction and pregnancy, intentional abandonment, requesting that he be punished according to the law. The indictment briefly stated that the plaintiff is 34 years old, residing at No. 429 Bubai Road in the French Concession, married to a man surnamed Chen, who died eight years ago. To maintain her livelihood, she is a teacher at the Bomei Embroidery School on Avenue Edward VII. In April of last year, she met the defendant on the road. After his repeated pursuits, they became friends. Later, on August 16th, she was deceived and lost her virginity at the Xintai Hotel in Hangzhou. Now the plaintiff is eight months pregnant, and the defendant has abandoned her. Therefore, she filed a lawsuit. This case has been summoned by the Special Court once. Because the defendant did not arrive, the court ordered a change of date for another hearing. Details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhong Qing continued the trial in the Second Criminal Court. The defendant Zhou Mingjiu also arrived in court with his lawyer. The plaintiff's attorney stated that the case was being mediated by relatives and friends during the rescheduling, and the plaintiff was nearly full-term in her pregnancy and eager to return to her hometown, so she did not want to be involved in litigation and requested to withdraw the case. Judge Zhong stated that according to Article 294 of the indictment, it is not a crime that can be prosecuted upon complaint and cannot be withdrawn according to regulations. He then began the trial. The defendant Zhou Mingjiu confessed that in April of last year, he was eating snacks in a coffee shop when the plaintiff came to shop, so they met and became friends. At that time, the plaintiff lived in the Tianjin Apartment and repeatedly invited him to go there, so he went to talk. Later, a physical relationship occurred in a Hangzhou inn, but they did not rent a house together, so there was no possibility of abandonment. He could not admit the pregnancy of the plaintiff, and he already had a wife at home. The court asked why the defendant still behaved absurdly outside since he had a wife. The defendant replied that this was just a moment of confusion and requested understanding. The plaintiff Ouyang Bibo then stated that the case was currently being mediated by relatives and friends, and she was eager to return home to give birth, so she requested instructions. Judge Zhong ordered the case to be rescheduled and ordered both parties to reconcile out of court. If a reconciliation is reached within seven days, a statement should be submitted to the court, otherwise a judgment will be made again.</p>

<h3>Tu Xiaoying and Daughter Accuse Tong Rongsong of Seduction and Forgery. 2,000 Yuan Passbook Forged from 100 Yuan. Court Investigated Bank and Obtained Truth. Debate Concluded Yesterday, Sentencing Scheduled.</h3>
<p>Tong Rongsong, a young man from Jiangdu, 19 years old, is the son-in-law of Sun of the Dalun Woolen Shop on Qipan Street. Recently, Tu Xiaoying (also known as Meizhen), a Ningbo woman residing at No. 19 Jinye Lane, Weihai Road, was accused by her mother, Tu Chenshi, and her uncle, Tu Jianren, of seduction and forgery in the First Special Court, as well as an additional civil lawsuit for 20,000 yuan. Judge Tan Xinzhen summoned them several times. Because the plaintiff originally pointed out that the 2,000 yuan passbook issued by the defendant by the China Industrial Bank was forged from one yuan, it was necessary to investigate this point with the bank. Therefore, the defendant was ordered to pay a 5,000 yuan bond for release pending trial. Details have been reported in this newspaper. At 11:20 AM yesterday morning, Judge Tan continued the trial in the Eighth Criminal Court and repeatedly questioned the defendant Tong Rongsong about the date and amount of the deposit. According to Tong, the total amount of the passbook was 300 yuan, which was deposited in January of last year. Later, because Tu Xiaoying borrowed money from me, the two of them were very close at the time, so I gave her the passbook at the Victory Ballroom on Beijing Road. However, no one else was present to see it. Tu Xiaoying was indeed a dancer who worked at the Dahuhui, Wellington, and other ballrooms. When I met her, it was at the Victory Ballroom, etc. According to Tu Xiaoying, the passbook stated 2,000 yuan, which was given on May 15th of this year, and I am not a dancer. I have never been to the Victory Ballroom. I only went to the New World Company's International Ballroom with the defendant. I now request that the defendant be punished according to the law. As for the additional civil lawsuit, her lawyer requested to withdraw it so that she could file a separate lawsuit in the civil court in the future. Judge Tan stated that according to the China Industrial Bank's reply, the amount on the passbook was indeed 300 yuan, which was deposited on February 18th of last year, and 200 yuan was withdrawn on the 21st, leaving 100 yuan. Therefore, the defendant's statement that the date of payment of the passbook was after the withdrawal of 200 yuan does not match the facts. At this point, the case was clear. After the lawyers for both parties debated, the court ordered a change of date for sentencing.</p>

<h3>Borrowing a Long Gown to Pawn for Prostitution. Two Lowlifes Fight. Two People Covered in Blood Arrested.</h3>
<p>Rogue Fang Baoqing, 24 years old, from Ningbo, residing at No. 11 Lixian Lane, Zilaihuo Street, French Concession, and Zhang Laoer, 28 years old, from Haimen, residing at No. 1 Jingyi Lane, Malang Road, are both lowlifes in the Baoyuli area of Dongxinqiao in the French Concession. At the beginning of this month, Zhang borrowed a long gown from Fang Baoqing for urgent needs and pawned it. It was learned that the clothes Zhang borrowed and pawned were used by Hu Tiao women and could not be redeemed for a long time, so he was trapped in a small inn every day and could not go out. As a result, the two became enemies and had a verbal dispute once. At about 2:00 AM yesterday morning, the two sides gathered more than a dozen people and fought in Baoyuli, Dongxinqiao Street. Fang Baoqing first used a sharp axe to chop Zhang Laoer's right arm. Zhang, in pain, seized the axe from Fang's hand and chopped Fang's leg twice. At that time, Lu Zhonglian came out to mediate, and they did not report the arrest. When the two were walking together on the grass east of the Zhongnan Hotel on Avenue Edward VII in the Public Concession, the patrolmen saw that Fang and Zhang were covered in blood and took them to the police station. Later, Zhang was seriously injured and was ordered to be sent to the hospital for treatment. Fang was slightly injured and temporarily detained. After learning that the location of the incident was in the French Concession, the French police were notified to send detectives to investigate.</p>

<h3>Report on Industrial and Commercial Changes in Shanghai in the First Quarter of This Year - Edited by China Credit Information (XXXII of Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Overview)</h3>
<p>The following table summarizes the general situation of the rise and fall of Shanghai's industry and commerce in the first three months of this year, compared with the same period last year, according to the statistics obtained from our institute's survey:</p>
<p>Observing the table above, the figures for various changes in the first quarter of the twenty-fifth year are larger than those in the same period of the twenty-fourth year. There are two reasons for this: one is that the industrial and commercial changes themselves this year are indeed greater than last year, and the other is that our institute's survey work and material collection work are better than before. As for the meaning of the column, expansion and contraction refer to the increase or decrease in the business scope of an enterprise. For example, an increase in capital or the establishment of a branch belongs to expansion, while the shutdown of machinery or the withdrawal of share capital belongs to contraction. If the change also involves a change of owner or name, it is classified under reorganization. In the statistics of our institute in the twenty-fourth year, these two changes were not specifically separated, so the figures are lacking. It does not mean that there were no such changes in the same period last year. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Special Issue of Shen Bao on National Products</p>
<h3>The Three Major Forces of the Summer Student National Products Movement</h3>
<p>— Yao Mingran</p>
<p>(1) Self-Reflection: Zengzi said, "I examine myself three times a day." Self-reflection can indeed lead to repentance and awareness of mistakes, which is the foundation for developing good habits. I have been using national products paper to write manuscripts for three years. At first, I also used imported goods that were not national products. Once I reflected on myself and realized it was not right, I immediately switched to using national products paper. This shows that as long as you reflect on yourself, any problem can be solved. Students are the backbone of society. In today's deeply troubled national situation, if they do not reflect and switch to using national products, then what else can be said? I think all students, whether in elementary, middle, or high school, should have this concept, using their strength to change the wrong path of using non-national products. This is the so-called heart-changing movement that fundamentally solves the problem in the current promotion of the summer student national products movement, so that we will not repeat past mistakes.</p>
<p>(2) Chain Reaction: Self-reflection alone is only the first stage of an individual using national products. Fortunately, students are in the initial stage of group life. I think friends who meet morning and evening should take responsibility together, using a chain reaction method to persuade each other to use national products. At the same time, the school should notify parents to work together. This will not be without some effect. The goal of national products is that students use national products. Students are not merchants blinded by profit and are easy to unite and reject foreign goods. However, this precious enthusiasm cannot be sustained without the support of principals and parents. To achieve this step, there must be a three-in-one chain reaction force of students, parents, and principals to be effective!</p>
<p>(3) Organizational Power: As mentioned above, a three-in-one force is necessary to achieve the goal of students using national products. But what is the use of not holding it enthusiastically? Isn't that just a bubble? Therefore, the allocation of organizational power is the main base camp for accomplishing this goal. I hope that if we do nothing, then so be it, but if we do, we must have the spirit of seeing it through from beginning to end, and the perseverance to make some achievements and models to show students who do not use national products. We do not use empty words, we only speak of a few points. To be honest, to achieve this major responsibility, we must ask the Summer Student National Products Movement Association to work with the Education Bureau to jointly handle it. I hope that in the future it will not be limited to the summer vacation, and it is best to have grades like homework, so that students can wake up. If this step cannot be implemented, I think there will be no effect!</p>
<p>A Word of Contribution</p>
<h3>Sending Off the Nanyang Commercial Inspection Group</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>The Nanyang Commercial Inspection Group, under the leadership of the China Industrial Foreign Trade Association, will embark on a long journey of thousands of miles tomorrow. What a magnificent trip! As a reporter, on the occasion of your departure, I respectfully offer this word of advice, as a small expression of my sincerity.</p>
<p>The gentlemen of the Nanyang Commercial Inspection Group are all powerful members of the national products industry, with experience in industrial manufacturing and export promotion. Based on their long-standing enthusiasm for national products, they will deeply investigate the actual situation of Nanyang trade, demonstrate the truth about national products and the contents of various factories, carry more than 300 boxes of samples, conduct large-scale publicity, and make extremely sincere connections. The impact on the export of national products is immeasurable.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, you should understand that Nanyang is of great importance to our country, and Japanese spies are eager for Nanyang. If our national products industry and Nanyang overseas Chinese do not have the determination to cooperate and fight to strengthen the strength of foreign trade, then our country's commercial position in Nanyang will soon disappear. Gentlemen, this trip should be with the determination to expand the field of national products, not just for ordinary socializing. As I see it, there are three things to avoid on this trip, and four things to emphasize. What are the three things to avoid?</p>
<p>(1) Avoid Meaningless Socializing: The inspection time is extremely short. It is certainly not acceptable to rush through it superficially. It is difficult to know the actual situation without long-term visits and extremely precise investigations. Therefore, meaningless socializing should be reduced or avoided as much as possible.</p>
<p>(2) Avoid Indulgent Behavior: The Nanyang Commercial Inspection Group is going abroad for the first time. All eyes are on you. If your behavior is improper, it will not only give overseas Chinese something to criticize, but also lose the trust of the people of Nanyang. Therefore, every move should respect the status of a national member and maintain the reputation of the country. All speeches and talks should be based on the overall position, not on trivialities, and should not be done independently.</p>
<p>(3) Avoid Perfunctory Work: The biggest problem with inspection groups in the past has been perfunctory work. After a superficial inspection, the excitement fades away. Everyone goes back to their own business and forgets about it. This kind of inspection is worthless. Therefore, we should work hard, thoroughly implement the plan, and maintain it from beginning to end with determination. After the inspection, there should be opportunities for contact and room for work at all times, correcting the past malpractices to great benefit.</p>
<p>What are the four things to emphasize?</p>
<p>(1) It is necessary to establish national products exhibition halls in major Nanyang cities with local chambers of commerce, to display the national product samples sent there for a long time, so as to show them to overseas Chinese and provide a constant reference. At the same time, we should promote the new and remove the old, and replace them from time to time.</p>
<p>(2) It is necessary to establish an introduction office in major Nanyang cities in conjunction with overseas Chinese to handle the introduction of national products and be responsible for answering inquiries from overseas Chinese in various places.</p>
<p>(3) It is necessary to establish a national products sales office or a Chinese national products company in major Nanyang cities with overseas Chinese or chambers of commerce, so that overseas Chinese can recognize national products and feel more affinity, and the sales of national products can be further expanded.</p>
<p>(4) It is necessary to establish a joint operations center for Shanghai national products factories in major Nanyang cities, gathering dozens of factories and inviting someone who is familiar with the Nanyang situation and has experience in sales to stay in Nanyang to preside over everything, so as to facilitate communication and boost sales.</p>
<p>This trip will complete Nanyang commercial shipping and establish a Nanyang bank, all in order to promote the development of Nanyang commerce and provide opportunities for the smooth sale of national products. The relationship of this trip is truly crucial. I also offer a word to wish you victory.</p>
<h3>Contributions to the Student Summer National Products Promotion Group</h3>
<p>— Xiao Shi</p>
<p>Patriotic students, in this hot summer, you have accepted the resolution of the National Products Movement United Association of this city, organized the Student Summer National Products Promotion Group, and gone to the interior to carry out advocacy. On the one hand, you are displaying your patriotic spirit, and on the other hand, you are awakening society. This is truly a great value and far-reaching significance! How to promote? How to guide? There will be very detailed regulations, which I need not repeat. What I want to contribute to the students is the several issues that should be paid attention to when promoting.</p>
<p>1.  Be Popular: The minds of the people in the interior are very simple, their knowledge is very shallow, and any strangeness in their actions and clothing can arouse their suspicion. If you are wearing and using one or two kinds of non-national products, or even most of them are non-national products, no matter how eloquent you are or how great a speaker you are, I am afraid that as soon as you open your mouth, people behind you will be criticizing you for being hypocritical. If you don't even know how to love your country, how can you be qualified to persuade others to love their country? This point is important. If you don't pay attention to it beforehand, the result will be futile, or even leave a very bad impression.</p>
<p>2.  Go Deep into Public Opinion: In big cities and towns, everything is more easily noticed. When we promote national products, we should pay more attention to the masses who do not know or are unaware. To reach the masses who do not know or are unaware, we must go deep into public opinion. In this hot weather, going deep into public opinion is indeed very troublesome. Transportation is inconvenient, and living and eating are mostly simple. Without the habit of being able to endure hardship, I am afraid that you will not be able to bear this responsibility. Now, private goods have penetrated deeply into public opinion. In remote areas, you can encounter peddlers selling smuggled goods everywhere. To eliminate smuggled goods, how can we not track smuggled goods and go deep into the people?</p>
<p>3.  Don't Complain About Hardship: Serving society and enduring hardship is common, but sometimes it can even make you suffer grievances for no reason. When we speak to the public, it is really difficult to predict whether it will be effective or not. If you are not careful, you may even be reprimanded to your face or suffer insulting words, which is extremely common in the uneducated interior. We must pay attention to it at all times, and even if we encounter it unfortunately, we should deal with it calmly. We should consider it as an expected occurrence of being wronged for no reason. If you cannot tolerate it, either the plan will fail or troubles will arise. Therefore, when you go out to promote, on the one hand, you must be able to endure hardship, and on the other hand, you must have a big belly to tolerate nonsense.</p>

<h3>Xianfang Cup Tennis: Tongji Defeats Zhenru</h3>
<p>In the Xianfang Cup tennis match, Tongji's victory over Zhenru yesterday was originally recorded as 9-6. However, upon investigation, there was no Chen Senlin on the Zhenru team. Although the team had requested to add a member due to having too few players, the Chinese Tennis Association, constrained by Article 3 of the cup rules, did not permit it. Therefore, his appearance in the second singles and third doubles (partnering with Liang Shufen) was deemed inappropriate. His match points must be cancelled, and the official score should be 13-2 in favor of Tongji. (1) Wang Xudong (Tongji) defeated Liang Shufen (Zhenru) 6-1, 6-2. Wang gave up the match. (3) Wang Xudong and Liu Tianze (Tongji) defeated Yang Shufen and Situ Shan (Zhenru) 6-1, 6-1, 6-3. (5) Ji Yubiao and Luo Guangkai (Tongji) defeated Yun Feng and Zhong Yunzi (Zhenru) 4-6, 7-5, 9-7.</p>

<h3>Our Country's Soccer Team's European Tour</h3>
<p>— Written and Sent by Team Captain Li Huitang</p>
<p>Rangoon, 8th (Continued)</p>
<p>(June 26) This morning, I read in the Chinese and Western newspapers that the number of spectators yesterday was actually 23,000. They greatly praised our spirit, morality, and soccer skills, which was unprecedented in Rangoon. However, the strength of the Rifle British Army team here is not yet at its peak. The next two matches, one against the local champion and one against a select team, will show what our soccer skills are really like. I haven't seen them yet. I heard that this soccer road is very different from the British Army's sweeping style. The overseas Chinese community is very earnestly reporting the strengths and weaknesses of the opposing team to us, and their concern for us is even greater than our own team's caution. At 2 PM this afternoon, we attended a tea party hosted by the Jinan University Alumni Association, with music to add to the fun. Several members of our team are Jinan University alumni, including Xu Yahui, Chen Zhenhe, and Liang Shutang, which made us feel even closer. After the meeting, we were invited to tour the city's scenery. Along the way, we saw the Golden Pagoda (also known as the Great Pagoda). The top of the pagoda is painted with real gold, which is worth a fortune. You must be barefoot when entering. Inside, there are many statues of gods, mostly decorated with gold. Those who come to Rangoon must visit here for a new perspective. We stayed in our residence and didn't go out in the evening, preparing for tomorrow's fierce battle.</p>
<p>(June 27) Today was our first match in Rangoon, against the Myanmar Police Team, the local champion. They are a strong team and one of the most famous in Southeast Asia. As soon as we arrived here, the overseas Chinese community expected us to defeat this stubborn enemy, and fans from all over were eager to see these two heroes meet. No wonder, when our team arrived at the stadium, nearly half the people were standing outside the gate and couldn't get in for almost half an hour. The crowding inside and outside broke the Rangoon record. There were too many fans in the stadium, who even squeezed into the lines of the field by more than a dozen layers. The spectators in the stands couldn't see the whole picture. The authorities hadn't anticipated this overflow beforehand and weren't prepared, leading to chaos that affected the soccer match. I heard that some people bought tickets at noon and waited inside for five hours. You can imagine their scramble. Their infatuation is even more pitiful. We lost 0-1 in the first half, and won 3-1 in the end. The scorers were Jiang Bo, Beihua, and Jiliang, one each. We slightly changed our formation and calculated as follows:</p>
<p>Bao Jiaping</p>
<p>Cai Wenli, Li Tiansheng</p>
<p>Chen Zhenhe, Liang Rongzhao, Zhang Xianyuan</p>
<p>Zheng Jiliang, Ye Beihua, Li Huitang, Tan Jiangbo, Cao Guicheng</p>
<p>As soon as the silver whistle blew, the Burmese people cheered and shouted for their team, encouraging them. When their team went on the attack, they were extremely agile, with flexible short passes and fierce offensives. In the first fifteen minutes, the soccer ball flew back and forth between the two teams, as fast as shooting stars, which was rare in all the matches. Our team defended more than attacked, resisting tenaciously. Finally, in the twenty-second minute, due to Wenli's inadequate defense, the enemy's right wing calmly crossed the ball, and their center forward flicked it in for the first score. At that time, there was a clap of thunder, and applause and screams mixed together, echoing through the clouds. Afterwards, the enemy's offensive was still fierce. Although we occasionally made advances, we always failed. Fortunately, the first half ended without us losing any more goals. During the break, because our team's performance was very chaotic and we were too focused on controlling the ball, we fell into the enemy's trap of agile passes. So we discussed the best way to deal with them in the second half. After the change of formation, our strategy changed, and our momentum was very different from before. In less than five minutes, Guicheng's precise shot and Jiang Bo's great header equalized the score. The overseas Chinese fans cheered repeatedly. Before long, Huitang got the ball in the middle, passed three defenders in a row, and shot fiercely with his right foot. The ball bounced off the goalkeeper's body. Fortunately, Beihua sprinted quickly, charged alone, and lightly flicked it in. Only then did the overseas Chinese compatriots smile. The other team's offensive in the first half was too fierce, and their defense was too tiring. In the second half, they lacked energy, and their offense and defense were relaxed, unlike the fierce attacks in the first half. Near the end of the match, Jiliang lay in wait on the left wing, waiting for Guicheng's cross from the middle. Like an arrow shot from a drawn bow, he volleyed, and after it went into the net, the goalkeeper was still as still as a wooden chicken. The match ended 3-1. The overseas Chinese compatriots all felt satisfied. Our team lost first in the first half, which was the first time we had been defeated on this southern tour. In the thirty minutes of battle, the other team definitely had the upper hand. It was very fortunate that we were able to defend and not lose too much. In the second half, our team's sleeping lion had awakened, and our measures were effective. In addition, the opponent's fatigue gradually appeared, and they couldn't hold on. If their goalkeeper hadn't had repeated luck, they would have lost more than three goals. The other team's strength was indeed extraordinary. Their coordination, short passes, control, footwork, and positioning were all excellent. Both wings were very active. The only thing they lacked was the final blow, which they didn't have a firm grip on. Every time they had a chance, they always missed it in an instant. Shooting is not easy. Everywhere we have been, we have felt that there are very few people who are skilled in this area. If we had lost one more goal in the first half, what would the result have been? I really don't want to imagine it. The fierceness and tension of the battle, and the danger of our position, made me feel a lingering fear after the fact. Our team played the enemy's fast game in the first half, which was unwise. In addition, Jiang Bo's leg was injured by the enemy, and he repeatedly wanted to seek revenge, so he couldn't focus all his attention on the game. It was not without reason that the forwards couldn't score on the field. Fortunately, he was teachable. In the second half, he didn't act impulsively. He scored the first goal with a header, which was a rare achievement. Jiang Bo's head is not easy to come by. The British consider it to be top-notch, and it's not an exaggeration. I alone scored five goals in the first half, becoming the target of everyone's attacks, which was expected. However, in the second half, I was still able to advance when the opportunity arose, repeatedly entering the enemy's territory, and posing a great threat to the enemy's defenders, causing them to be distracted. Wenli hadn't been on the field for a long time, and he felt unfamiliar at first, but he gradually got into the game. Tiansheng was one of the best performers on this southern tour, and his skills in tackling, hooking, and stealing were all excellent, earning him a lot of praise. Rongzhao, after Yahui got sick, took over the defense in the middle and also made significant progress. The rest of the players, except for Beihua, who hasn't recovered his former form, were all able to work hard and put on a good performance. Guicheng ran fast, making the enemy look like children, which also made the people here clap their hands and sigh. If he could train his stamina, then Guicheng is not old yet.</p>
<p>Educational News</p>
<h3>The Sixth Annual Meeting of the Chinese Children's Education Society Was Held in Lushan; Cheng Bolu, Chen Heqin, Dong Renjian, etc. Presided and Reported; This Year's Meeting Focused on Group Meetings and Academic Discussions</h3>
<p>The Sixth Annual Meeting of the Chinese Children's Education Society was held at the Lushan Library from the 10th to the 13th of this month. The opening ceremony was held at 9 AM on the 10th, with more than 200 member representatives present. The presidium included Cheng Bolu, Chen Heqin, Dong Renjian, Cheng Qibao, Li Qingsong, Ma Ketan, and Yu Ziyi. The ceremony was conducted according to protocol.</p>
<p>Chen Heqin's Address</p>
<p>Next, Chen Heqin reported on the Society's affairs, stating in essence that the Chinese Children's Education Society started from the Nanjing Gulou Kindergarten. Since 1929, in a few years, the number of members has reached more than 3,000, with 17 branches and 13 working districts established. In terms of work, the Society focuses on academic research. The reading group of the Shanghai branch has held 63 meetings and published publications such as the Children's Education Monthly and annual reports, as well as 36 series of books. It is also planning to publish 1,000 series of books in the next three years. In addition, it is collecting children's education books for members to read and sending members to conduct field surveys at home and abroad. In terms of funding, the subsidies from various sources and membership fees are sufficient for application. As for the Society's goals for future efforts, the first is to enable children to fully develop their bodies and minds under the current national situation, the second is to promote the movement of building the country with good teachers, and finally, to express gratitude to the local party and government officials and the gentlemen of the preparatory committee.</p>
<p>Xie Yinian's Report</p>
<p>Next, Xie Yinian, representative of the preparatory committee, reported on the preparation process, first stating the unique points of this year's annual meeting compared to previous annual meetings: (1) Previous annual meetings focused on the reading of papers, while this year's meeting focuses on group discussions; (2) Previous annual meetings invited representatives from various academic institutions in China to participate in the meeting, while this year's meeting focuses on the exchange of academics; (3) At this year's annual meeting, each branch and each working district sent representatives to participate and jointly discuss the methods for carrying out the affairs of each place; (4) This year's annual meeting does not focus on serious formal discussions, but on the unity of spirit and will. Next, he said that the work of the preparatory committee failed to do everything perfectly and hoped that the members would understand and forgive.</p>
<p>Cheng Bolu's Speech</p>
<p>Next, Cheng, Director of the Jiangxi Education Department, gave a speech, the main idea of which was that this year's annual meeting of the Chinese Children's Education Society in Lushan has three special meanings: (1) The Chinese Children's Education Society has made special contributions to Chinese children's education; (2) Lushan is a famous scenic spot in the world and a Chinese park. China has been dominated by Buddhist, Neo-Confucian, and modern cultural spirits for thousands of years. Lushan has the combination of the Lotus Society for Buddhist research, the Zhu Xi lectures at the White Deer Cave for Neo-Confucianism, and the foreign missionaries studying religion in Guling for modern culture. The Chinese Children's Education Society should carry on the past and open up to create Lushan's fourth period of culture; (3) The special significance of the conference itself is to emphasize academic discussion and the unity of spiritual will.</p>
<p>In addition, he has three hopes for the Chinese Children's Education Society: (1) He hopes that the conference will focus on discussing problems, and that solutions can be found for compulsory education, children's health, labor education, science education, and education in extraordinary times. Special attention should also be paid to the training of teachers themselves; (2) He hopes to promote the atmosphere of academic research. The Chinese Children's Education Society is the authority on children's education in the country and should take on the responsibility of shifting the social atmosphere and promoting academic research; (3) He hopes that the members of the Chinese Children's Education Society will deeply recognize the demands of the times and that all aspects of life will be militarized. Under the firm belief of building the country with good teachers, establish several creeds, be determined and unremitting, in order to realize it. Later, Tan Bingxun, director of the Administration Bureau, gave a speech.</p>
<p>After the opening of the conference, all the members were divided into 14 small groups, and each group held a friendship meeting to report on the status of the schools served by the members, the research experience, and various practical problems, and to seek solutions. In the afternoon, group discussion meetings were held, divided into (1) Elementary School Administration, (2) Elementary School Teaching, and (3) Early Childhood Education.

<h3>Analysis of National Compulsory Education Funding; Over 4.7 Million Yuan This Year</h3>
<p>In the past, the funding for compulsory education in various provinces and cities across the country was mostly raised by the provinces, cities, and local areas themselves, which hindered its full development. Since the 24th year of the Republic, the central government has included 2.4 million yuan in the national treasury budget to subsidize compulsory education funding in various provinces and cities, leading the way. With the addition of funding raised by provinces, cities, and counties themselves, progress in the implementation of compulsory education has been steadily increasing through this dual approach. In the 24th year of the Republic, the central government's payment for national compulsory education funding was 2.4 million yuan. The Sino-British, Sino-French, Sino-American, and Sino-Belgian Boxer Indemnity Funds were originally intended to be subsidized by the central education authorities with 800,000 yuan, totaling 3.2 million yuan. However, after discussion, only the Sino-French and Sino-American Boxer Indemnity Funds provided subsidies, totaling 300,000 yuan. Therefore, the central government's compulsory education funding in the 24th year of the Republic was nominally 3.2 million yuan, but in reality, it was only 2.7 million yuan. This year's (25th year) central budget includes 5 million yuan for education construction and 500,000 yuan for border education, totaling 5.5 million yuan. After deducting 1.1 million yuan for operating mass schools, compiling supplementary reading materials for the masses, and for educational films and radio education (how this 1.1 million yuan will be allocated will be decided by the education authorities in a meeting soon), there remains 4.4 million yuan. With the addition of 150,000 yuan from the Sino-American Boxer Indemnity Fund, 50,000 yuan from the Sino-French Boxer Indemnity Fund, and over 100,000 yuan from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund (the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund, including subsidies for middle schools, totals 200,000 yuan, with the larger subsidy for compulsory education being between 120,000 and 150,000 yuan), the total is over 4.7 million yuan for the central government's compulsory education funding in the 25th year. It is reported that the central education authorities have already held a meeting and decided to allocate 4.6 million yuan to subsidize various provinces, cities, and border areas for the implementation of compulsory education. The remaining tens of thousands of yuan will be used for expenses related to compulsory education experiments, equipment, and supervision. The specific amounts of compulsory education funding that each province, city, and district should receive from the central government will be communicated to the provinces, cities, and districts by the responsible education authorities via telegram.</p>

<h3>Finance: Spot Gold Premium Drops Again by One Yuan and One Cent; Futures Premium Only Rises by Slightly More Than Three Yuan</h3>
<p>The gold market was weak after an initial calm yesterday, resulting in sideways movement. Supply and demand within the market were relatively balanced, but due to spot premium swap activities, short selling seemed active, continuing to push prices lower. Early in the morning, overseas silver markets saw London rise and the US remain flat. Monte Carlo forward silver prices rose by between five haos and two and a half percent. Exchange rates narrowed, and London spot gold rose by half a penny. The central bank's listed price was announced to be 1128 yuan. Pre-market trading opened at a weak 33 yuan, but lacked significant impact. The morning opening was slightly lower, and the market immediately went down due to oversupply. However, buying activity emerged after the dip, leading to a brief rebound. HSBC's listed prices for gold and ginger remained flat. The market remained weak, and the silver equalization tax was announced to have risen by half a cent. After this, the situation was calm, hovering around 32 yuan for quite some time. However, the afternoon closing trend was still difficult to boost. The overall market was narrow because futures and spot prices were close. Currently, the premium is only slightly more than 3 yuan, and it is predicted that the current spot premium swap will be no more than that. Both long and short positions are taking a wait-and-see approach. Here is a record of the day's market conditions:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 1132 yuan and 7 jiao, down 1 jiao from the previous close. Luo (brokers) sold a strip at a 1.13 yuan decline, dropping to 1 yuan and 3 jiao. Dafang, Yonghengchang, Yongding, and Kangyuanmao bought strips on the dip, rebounding to 2 yuan and 3 jiao. Fuxing and Yong scattered sold slightly. Although HSBC's listed price was flat, it was still offered at 1 yuan and 7 jiao. Dachangxiang, Dafangyong, and others bought strips on the dip. The silver equalization tax rose by half a cent, rising to 2 yuan and 1 jiao. Hongkang, Yongqian, and Changxiang sold. The afternoon closing was 1131 yuan and 7 jiao.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 1131 yuan and 7 jiao. Fuxing and Yong sold, retreating to 1 yuan and a half. Dadecheng and Yicheng bought strips, rising to 2 yuan and 1 jiao. Futaiyong, Shendayong, and Hui Xiang sold. The closing price dropped to 1131 yuan and 7 jiao.</p>
<p>The settlement price, based on the central bank's standard gold price, rose to 1128 yuan, an increase of about 4 yuan from the closing price, less than 1 yuan more than the previous close. This month's book entry is 1128 yuan, and August's is 1132 yuan. The morning supplementary water (margin call) was 1128 yuan, and pure gold was increased by 8 yuan to 1140 yuan and 7 jiao. The spot market situation was balanced, with Tianjin goods increased by 15 yuan, and boiled red gold increased by 13 yuan, with a lack of sellers. Boiled red gold increased by 16 yuan and a half, with Shengyuan Yong selling 50 taels to Yang Qinghe and Fuji. The difference between July and August futures was roughly around 2.5 yuan, but no transactions were made. The current premium for August futures is slightly higher than the futures price. The expected premium for the upcoming August-September spread is about 3.5 yuan.</p>
<p>There were not many transactions within the market. In summary, Yuanmaoyong, Dachangxiang, Wanxing, Dafangyonghengchang, Yongdaidecheng, Qingfayongqian, Changxiangyicheng, and Futaiyong were on the buying side. Dingkang, Hongkangyong, Xiangfengyuanyidahengyuxin, Xianghengyu, and Tongfengheng were on the selling side.</p>
<p>The day's market conditions were still difficult to boost. The morning opening was 1132 yuan and 7 jiao, and the afternoon closing was 1131 yuan and 7 jiao. The highest price was 1132 yuan and 7 jiao, and the lowest was 1131 yuan and 3 jiao, a fluctuation of 1 yuan and 4 jiao. The result was a decrease of 1 yuan and 1 jiao compared to the previous close. Due to a lack of official orders, there are still 1953 strips remaining in this month's strips, with a total of 11 long positions and 9 short positions. The total chips for August futures are 12,642 strips, with a total of 46 long positions and 32 short positions. The total number of transactions was 2,534 strips in the morning and 546 strips in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange: Sterling Flat, US Dollar Tight; Shanghai Selling Pressure Heavy</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market remained flat yesterday, but the US dollar tightened slightly. The process was uncertain. Early in the morning, overseas telegrams reported that London forward rates rose by 1.25 points. The New York silver market remained unchanged, and Monte Carlo forward silver prices rose by between five haos and two and a half percent. London spot gold rose by half a penny. Sterling against the US dollar remained unchanged, Sterling against the French franc fell by 7 points, the US dollar against Sterling narrowed by 0.09375, and the US dollar against the French franc rose by 1.6875 points. The central bank's listed exchange rates were announced to be flat for both Sterling and the US dollar, and the customs gold unit rose by a decimal. The morning opening price for the near-term foreign exchange market was 1 shilling, 2 pence, 375 for Sterling, and 30 yuan, 125 for the US dollar, which was flat compared to the previous close for both gold and ginger. After the opening, banks took advantage of the cheap prices to buy and balance their positions. HSBC's listed prices were announced to be flat for both gold and ginger, and banks had reciprocal transactions. Shanghai's difficulty in clearing Sterling also had no impact. The silver equalization tax was announced to have risen by half a cent, leading to mixed buying and selling activities. Banks still had reciprocal transactions, and there was a lack of major changes. The volume of transactions was limited, and the market atmosphere was extremely quiet. The closing price for the near-term foreign exchange market was 1 shilling, 2 pence, 375 for Sterling, and 30 yuan, 375 for the US dollar. Compared to the previous close, Sterling was flat and the US dollar tightened by 0.03125. The same was true for forward rates. Chinese merchants sold about 100,000 US dollars. On the banking side, Shanghai continued to sell. Here is a record of the day's transactions:</p>
<p>The morning opening price for the near-term Sterling exchange rate was 1 shilling, 2 pence, 375. Shanghai sold to Banque Belge for September at 25 and 3125. Shanghai sold to Zhengjin for August at 3125 and 375. Mitsui bought for July at 375. Macgary bought for September at 25 and 3125. The afternoon closing price for the near-term Sterling exchange rate was 1 shilling, 2 pence, 375. In the afternoon market, Macgary, Citibank, and Banque Belge bought for September at 25 and 3125. The closing price for the spot market was 1 shilling, 2 pence, 375. The same price for July, 3125 for the remaining months, 25 for September, and 1875 for October. Buying prices are slightly higher.</p>
<p>The morning opening price for the near-term US dollar exchange rate was 30 yuan, 125. Zhengjin bought spot at 125. Shanghai sold to Macgary for August at 29 yuan, 9375 and 30 yuan. San Yu sold to Macgary for the same month at 30 yuan. Zhengjin bought for August at 30 yuan. The afternoon closing price for the near-term exchange rate was 30 yuan, 09375.

<h3>Securities: Retail Selling Continues Unabated; Government Bonds Decline Again</h3>
<p>The market on the China Merchants Securities Exchange was weak again yesterday. Issues 11 and 37 saw the most selling, but short sellers were actively covering positions. Issues 4, 20, and 66 also saw advances. Although the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee has concluded and there have been no special changes, most people in the market remain firm. Any slight decline is immediately covered, leading to a rebound. Without drastic changes in the situation, it is not easy for high prices to undergo significant fluctuations. Yesterday's two trading sessions saw the current month's E class open weakly and then recover, remaining extremely firm. Forward trades were sold off a little in Issue 37, causing the market atmosphere to shift. At the same time, Issue 11 saw extremely active selling of D class shares, and retail investors followed suit, causing the C class to plummet by 6 jiao and the A class by half a yuan. The current month's E class closed down by a small 4 jiao, likely because it had not fallen at all in the previous two days. Later, Issues 20, 66, and 4 all saw considerable buying, causing the market price to firm up again. The near-term A class rebounded by as much as 4 and a half jiao. The market prices ultimately fell by between 1 or 2 jiao and 7 jiao. The total transaction volume was 6,525,000 yuan. The results of the price changes are compared in the table below: (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Local Yarn Trading Too Stagnant; Yarn Market Reveals Weakness; However, There is Still Some Boost This Month, and the Decline is Slightly Reduced</h3>
<p>The yarn market is weakening, and the trend of decline is slightly increasing. This is because US cotton continues to fall, causing discouragement, and the current yarn sales market is unusually cold. Customers have no ability to purchase due to high prices. However, the mentality of general speculators is unusually enthusiastic. Considering the good performance of overseas cotton, they blindly advance, and there are rumors that there may be short squeezes in the near month. Unfortunately, local yarn trading is too stagnant, with only 50 bales traded throughout the day, while Japanese yarn trading has more than 300 bales.</p>
<p>#### Forward Months Fall Sharply by Two Yuan</p>
<p>At the pre-noon opening of marked yarn, the market mentality was fatigued due to the continued decline in US cotton. Near-term fell by 1.2 yuan, and forward months fell by 1.45 yuan. The market was weak. After the second session, there were various rumors in the market, saying that the long side was preparing to take delivery of a large quantity of goods and there were short squeeze actions. The August contract suddenly jumped by 1 yuan, and forward months followed, rising by 1 yuan to 6.7 jiao. By the third closing, it was heard that current yarn sales were quiet and local yarn was scarce, and market sentiment turned loose. Although the near month was high, forward months fell sharply by more than 1 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous day's closing price, all months except the near month rose by 4 jiao, and forward months fell sharply by 2 yuan to 2 yuan, 1.4, and 7 jiao. The opening prices of near and far months reversed and weakened. When bidding for September and October contracts, the Three-Piece Yarn of Dagu rose sharply by 3.4 yuan in the near month, and market sentiment was still not aroused. All months rose by 6.7 jiao, but afterward, due to sluggish yarn sales, the near month fell by 6 jiao to 1 yuan compared to the morning closing price, and the forward month rose by 1 jiao. It was found that 1,600 bales of Deda were sold, 1,950 bales of Dafu, 1,200 bales of Tongji, 950 bales of Hengyi, 3,500 bales of Taixing, 2,250 bales of Gengfeng, 1,300 bales of Xingchang, 2,600 bales of Changfeng, 4,950 bales of Runkang, 1,800 bales of Dachang, and 1,100 bales of Xiacheng. 1,350 bales of Juxing, 2,800 bales of Yudai, 900 bales of Yuanda, 1,550 bales of Hexing, 1,400 bales of Fengtai, 4,900 bales of Shenji, 3,850 bales of Dachangcheng, 1,730 bales of Taichang, 1,000 bales of Hengchang, and 1,000 bales of Dachang were bought. The daily high and low prices and closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>December Contract | 216.2 | 215.0 | 215.1 | Down 2.00 | 79,650</p>
<p>Total | 736,650</p>
<p>#### Current Yarn Sales Clear at Lower Prices</p>
<p>Current yarn sales are very clear. It was found that various merchants bought 387 bales throughout the day, and the selling price fell by 1 yuan. The purchase amount of each merchant is listed below:</p>
<p>Same Industry 155, Wuhu 10, Changsha 5</p>
<p>Inland 205, Ningbo 7, Tianjin 5</p>
<h3>Cotton Merchants Sell Short En Masse, Marked Cotton Falls Across the Board</h3>
<p>The cotton market saw new and old cotton fall across the board, and momentum was slightly dampened. The drought-stricken area of US cotton received rain, and southern farmers continued to sell short, falling by more than ten pounds. Indian cotton also followed, and market sentiment was discouraged. At the same time, demand for current cotton completely stopped, and everyone sold short. However, the long side's intention remained firm, and the idea of squeezing the old cotton market has not yet been abandoned.</p>
<p>#### Near and Far Months Fall by About Half a Yuan</p>
<p>At the opening of the marked cotton market yesterday, US cotton received rainfall, and southern cotton farmers sold short, falling by 8 to 16 pounds. Indian cotton also fell by 1 Rupee 75. Dagu's Three-Piece Cotton fell by 1.2 yuan in the near month. Market sentiment was average, and buying momentum decreased. The near month fell by 3.5 jiao. When bidding for the August contract, the long side came to pull up again, and the market appeared tight and unmoved. In October, old cotton received the assistance of the long side and suddenly jumped by 2.5 jiao. The August contract was restored to above 50 yuan, but the volume was average. By the closing, the cotton market was weak due to the lack of strength in the yarn market. Some of the profitable long side closed out, and old cotton fell sharply by 3 or 4 jiao. The far month was dragged down by Shanghai. As a result, compared to the previous day's closing price, old cotton fell by 4 to 4.5 jiao, and new cotton fell by 4.5 to 6.8 jiao. At the afternoon opening, old cotton was still exhausted and weak, while new cotton rose by 2 jiao. The third closing was because the Osaka Three-Piece Cotton market turned firm after being weak. The near month jumped sharply by 5.5 jiao, the August contract rose by 2.5 jiao, and new cotton rose by 5 points. As a result, all months rose by 1 jiao compared to the morning closing price. It was found that 3,000 dan of Yuda were sold, 2,500 dan of Yikang, 2,000 dan of Deda, 15,000 dan of Tongji, 12,000 dan of Hengyi, 7,200 dan of Mingde, 4,000 dan of Senkang, 1,600 dan of Changfeng, 2,500 dan of Dachang, 1,500 dan of Changhe, 1,700 dan of Xingchang, 3,700 dan of Changyu, 2,500 dan of Taichang, 2,000 dan of Xiacheng, and 6,000 dan of Shengyuan. 25 dan of Xinchang, 3,000 dan of Juxing, 1,500 dan of Yukang, 3,000 dan of Dafeng, 4,700 dan of Yuanda, 11,000 dan of Hexing, 3,500 dan of Shenchang, 3,500 dan of Ruida, 2,500 dan of Fengtai, 12,500 dan of Shenji, 8,800 dan of Dachangcheng, and 4,000 dan of Runkang were bought.

<h3>Three-Piece Yarn Firm, Cotton Weak</h3>
<p>A telegram from Osaka on the 14th stated that Three-Piece Yarn rose by 9 jiao to 4 yuan and 8 jiao, with the near month at 217 yuan and the far month at 209 yuan and 8 jiao. Cotton futures rose by 1.5 jiao to 4.5 jiao, with the near month at 73 yuan and 7 jiao and the far month at 66 yuan and 8 jiao and 5 jiao.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Steel Market Stands Out</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the hardware market saw activity as factories like Kangyuan, Nanyang, and Huacheng made purchases. 200 boxes of 90-pound tinplate opened at $18.75. 650 boxes of old steel mill goods from the Trading Company sold between $35 and $36. New steel mill goods opened at $33 to $33.25. Due to limited stock, narrow hoop iron also increased to $23. Single-coated patterned iron opened at varying prices from $26 to $28. Enamel factories disposed of 300 dan (a unit of weight) of first-cut scrap iron at $6, and 500 dan of prime-grade iron at $9.25. Battery factories and printing houses purchased 40 to 50 barrels of white lead sheets. Prices per dan were approximately $30.05 for #5, $30 for #6, $29.75 for #7, and $29.50 for thick patterned iron. The East White Iron market has been quite chaotic recently, resulting in limited offerings. The market saw little change. Due to specific demand, 7-8 boxes of #26 large tinplate opened at $75-76. Although #24 tinplate was also offered, the quantity was small, so the price remained unchanged, it is said.</p>

<h3>Local Cotton Yarn Inventory at its Lowest; Total Inventory Counts 82,460 Bales</h3>
<p>According to a survey by a certain foreign firm in this port, the cotton yarn inventory of Chinese, British, and Japanese factories at the end of June totaled 82,460 bales, an increase of 4,077 bales compared to the 78,383 bales at the end of May. Among them, the amount of Japanese factory yarn was 6,572 bales, an increase of 1,206 bales compared to the previous month. The amount of Chinese yarn was 75,888 bales, an increase of 2,871 bales compared to the previous month. It is found that 20-count yarn accounts for the most at 54,022 bales, an increase of 1,568 bales compared to the end of the previous month.

<h3>Foodstuffs: New Wheat Abundant, Standard Market Sentiment Loosens</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market, after opening in the morning, saw slight increases in all months, but reversed and fell in the afternoon. U.S. wheat quotations: Chicago nearby down a little over 4 jiao, distant down 8 fen to 1 jiao plus; Canadian good around 2 jiao. Therefore, the initial sentiment was still calm, similar to the previous day. Later, short-covering was very smooth, and prices turned higher, up 3-4 fen compared to the previous day. December was still down 4 fen. By the time the afternoon prices opened, sentiment gradually weakened, falling nearly 1 jiao from the morning's highest price, and also down 3-4 fen compared to the previous day's closing price. Currently, market sentiment is based on the fact that the United States has received timely rain, and U.S. wheat quotations are expected to mostly decline. The domestic wheat market, with abundant arrivals, is also difficult to sustain its strength for long. Rumor has it that the flour market situation has also greatly eased, and major bulls have covertly liquidated their positions. Therefore, with these two factors working together, market sentiment has gradually loosened. Currently, the wheat market, with cargo from Zhongguan not yet opened, only opened special high-quality goods from the Jinpu Railway, such as Mingguang Guandian wheat at 4 yuan 5 jiao 5 fen, totaling 6,000 bags, handled by Fufeng. Huaian wheat at 4 yuan 5 jiao, Jiangbei wheat at 4 yuan 4 jiao 7 fen, and substandard at 4 yuan 3 fen, handled by Zhongda for 3,000 bags, it is said.</p>

<p>U.S. Wheat Market Conditions: The Northwest is still short of rain, and there is no significant change. Although there have been showers, they are still insufficient, and the weather has become hot again. Last week, the visible supply estimate increased by 6,577,000 bushels. Canada's climate and crop reports are contradictory. Some estimate the output to be 275,000,000 bushels, while Snoad, owner of Chicago's Mettel Toffree Company, estimates it to be 225,000,000 bushels. Until the situation is clear, it is expected to be mixed.</p>

<h3>Flour Gray Market Down 4-5 Fen</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, opening both morning and afternoon, continued to follow price limits for all months. There were not many formal transactions between the two parties, but the self-dealing among brokers was quite active. The previously reported gray market situation gradually loosened because overseas wheat quotations had fallen back due to rain, and domestic demand for spot flour was also quieter. In addition, with the abundant arrival of new wheat, all factories were able to maximize production, so some bulls were no longer stubbornly holding on. Near and distant months were reportedly down to a gray market price of 3-4-5 fen. If overseas quotations continue to be unfavorable, this kind of above-the-table operation can disappear invisibly, it is said.</p>
<h3>Rice High-Quality Goods Market Still Firm</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, various sources only arrived with a dozen or so vendors, totaling over 2,000 piculs of goods. Sales in this street had gradually become active, but suddenly suffered a closure of a certain feed store, resulting in a large batch of spot goods being released, so sales in this street became sluggish again. The wholesale of goods from both the northern and southern groups only handled about 600 bags, and although the arrival of early japonica and thin indica rice was scarce, the resulting market showed a stable to slightly soft trend. Du Yangxian was similar, with no change in the gray market price.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, over a dozen vendors arrived from various routes, and the various outlets in the market turned quiet again. Fresh white japonica prices retreated by a small number of fen to 1 jiao, while old and substandard goods were stagnant. Thin indica was high and firm, while substandard was weak. White glutinous rice prices increased. Yangpu premium rice was short by about 1 jiao. The prices of other goods were uncertain.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: U.S. Price of Chinese and Japanese Silk Increases</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the overseas silk market had a bullish sentiment. Although the sale of New York White Factory spot futures was slightly down by half a cent compared to last Saturday, the holding price of Chinese and Japanese silk actually increased by 6 fen in the U.S. The actual sales are not smooth. Yokohama silk prices remained firm as before, with spot prices unchanged and futures slightly down by 1 yuan. Shanghai silk traders are still watching and holding firm, with very few transactions. Foreign firms are only doing some intermittent trading, it is said.</p>
<h3>Private Goods Silk Auction Not Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Jianghai Customs in this port solicited bids for 130-odd boxes of private goods silk. Although there were many bidders, there was a sudden dispute, so the auction was not opened. The market inventory is thin, and customers are waiting to handle the goods, so the prices in various markets have soared. Today, the price of 120-number Tianqiao brand is 415 yuan, and the price of 120-number Taiyang brand and Tiantan brand are both 400 yuan. However, the effectiveness is not significant, so households are not yet willing to sell. Only the Nanshi Silk Belt Factory purchased 20-odd boxes of Taiyang brand silk, with prices as above.</p>
<h3>Tunxi Zhenmei Tea Sales Active in Europe</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Tunxi Zhenmei was still quite active. Since the Jilong company greatly sold off after the price decreased the day before, Tianyu also started to handle about 400-odd boxes, with transaction prices ranging from 81 to 90 yuan. Market prices are still firm. Jardine Matheson purchased over 100-odd boxes of Tunxi oil-treated Zhenmei at a price of 114 yuan. Xiehe Tea Company purchased over 200-odd boxes of Wuyuan Northwest Township Zhenmei at prices ranging from 75 to 83 yuan. In addition, Tongfu Baolong and other firms also had scattered transactions for various teas. PingShui different color Pearl tea had been silent for many days, but turned active yesterday. Jardine Matheson purchased about 1,400-odd boxes, and Jinlong purchased about 600-odd boxes, with selling prices ranging from 56 to 58 yuan. The total sales of black and green tea in the city reached over 4,800-odd boxes. Green tea prices were stable, and black tea prices fell by 3-4 yuan. Among them, the floral fragrance category also fell by 2-3 yuan compared to the previous time.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Dyed Fabric Orders Excellent, Fine Cloth Also Better Than Previous Years</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the piece goods market gradually stabilized. Various dyeing factories are receiving orders for various colored fabrics for export in this month. Most of these orders are from the Sichuan group. Currently, they are processing and dyeing in a rush, fearing they will not be able to keep up. Spot fine cloth and fine twill are in great panic, and the spot goods in various stalls in the market have been almost completely collected. The subsequent business of adding colored fabrics is quiet for the Sichuan group, but the Shanxi and Henan groups are still adding some. Guangzhou factories and dyeing factories are selling some of the cheap fine twill and plain cloth they had previously absorbed. These are being purchased by wholesale shops, dyeing factories, and the Yangtze River group in this street, with prices slightly cheaper than the market (per piece) by 2.5 fen to 5 fen. The factories' sentiment is still firm and high, and the factories are raising the prices they are calling for, with a small amount being offered. Customer groups are buying at market prices, and sales to customers are most active along the Yangtze River, including Datong, Anqing, Nanchang, Tingzhou, and Hubei. The most popular items are this factory's fine cloth, fine twill, pigment broadcloth, straight tribute crepe, and woolen cloth, totaling over 300 pieces. The medium and lower grades of plain poplin in the market are particularly popular. The Huayang, Yufeng, Guangzhong, and other factories have sold out of exports. The stock of Tianyi goods increased by 1 fen per yard in the market. The Xiamen plain poplin factory had 60-70 boxes in stock, which were all purchased by wholesale shops in this street. The stock of striped poplin is also gradually decreasing. This year's poplin market is much better than in previous years, it is said.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods: Tong'an Dried Longan Harvest Hopeless; Lychee Arrives in Abundance, Selling Prices Also Loosen</h3>
<p>The flower seedlings for Tong'an dried longan were very good this year, and a full harvest was expected. However, due to the drought recently, the newly formed fruits are falling off from time to time, resulting in a greatly reduced harvest. According to recent Tong'an communications, based on the current situation, it is predicted to be only 60-70% of what was expected. However, there may still be changes in the future.</p>
<p>The first batch of orchid bamboo branches, bird leaf branches, early red branches, etc., produced in Zhangzhou, only arrived in small quantities last week. Coincidentally, they ran into a sharp drop in Guangzhou branches, resulting in a large reduction in exchange prices. The higher prices were 22 yuan per package, and the lower prices were around 15 yuan. The second and third batches of orchid bamboo branches have also been transported, totaling 188 boxes from Taiyuan and Shandong. As the customs clearance procedures have not been completed, they are expected to open tomorrow. Several hundred boxes of Haikou branches and Shuidong branches opened yesterday, with prices loosening by 1 yuan to several jiao, and the lowest prices were not more than 9 yuan. Jinshan branches, Yushan branches, etc., are also continuing to fall. The production price of new glutinous rice branches is 100 yuan, and the price of dried rice branches is around 80 yuan. They have not yet arrived in Shanghai. Fresh goods of good quality are only selling for 16-17 yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— (Fang Shujun)</p>
<p>Living in the 20th century, the competition for survival is becoming increasingly fierce, the strong bully the weak, and the many bully the few. Weak nations are like fish in a pot, dogs without homes, oppressed by the strong everywhere. Therefore, what we need at this time is to use our clean minds and even more unsavory hands to develop our abilities and enrich our skills. If we harbor the mentality of "I only eat this bowl of rice, only wear this piece of clothing," and feel content with what we have, then we will forever be at the mercy of others. Living in the world in this way is merely occupying a space; living out one's remaining body in mediocrity is no different from being a beast. Therefore, "all the possibilities of life are like a weighing scale; it can fall to the good side, or it can fall to the bad side." Don't wait until it's all bad before you realize it, because by then, life will already be gone.</p>
<p>No labor or hardship in the universe is enough to be considered suffering; the greatest suffering is losing the ability to control one's own spiritual will.</p>
<p>Only "courage" can lead to victory, only "struggle" can lead to light, only "hard work" can fulfill our mission.</p>
<h3>Indian Beauty</h3>
<p>— Lan Shan</p>
<p>Next door to my aunt's house, upstairs in the living room, a family moved in last month—Mr. and Mrs. Ma, and their beautiful young daughter. Not long after, I don't know who racked their brains and gave her an honorary title, calling her "Indian Beauty"!</p>
<p>This title is a bit incongruous, but it's also quite fitting. —Even Miss Ma herself silently acknowledges it with a smile. —It's because she has a face and body of glowing dark skin. When she talks to you or yawns, her teeth, as white as seashells, compete with the shiny blackness of her face, reflecting each other and making people feel the beauty of snow in charcoal. This is further enhanced by a straight and upright jade nose, a pair of lively, round, and large black eyes, a slender and shapely figure, and liberated breasts that are still tremulous. In this light, she is almost no different from the wives of Indians. The aesthetic ideals of 1936 have already moved from the shallow praise of whiteness to the praise of black charm. What about "Black Peony," "Black Temptation," and endless cries, aren't they clear proof? All colors are false, only black is the true, powerful, and moving king of colors!</p>
<p>Indian Beauty also understands this principle deeply, and she is very pleased to have this kind of skin color. She is very close to my cousin—Xian—and last time she advised her: "If you want to get skin like mine, it's best to go to the Hongkou swimming pool often. After a few months, I guarantee you can succeed. —I myself can't play around anymore, for fear that the sun will shine on my face. If the skin fades, then one piece will be light, and one piece will be dark, and there's no way to fix it." But she has done her research. Xian was so moved by what she said that she asked me for advice the day before yesterday, and even wanted me to accompany her to swim every Saturday and Sunday. I said: "If you intend to become an Indian Beauty number two, you might as well: but unfortunately, you don't have a straight nose, and your eyes aren't round and big enough, it's not like it." When I said this, she also realized it.</p>
<p>Indian Beauty likes to wear rose-red and jujube-red clothes, which can increase her charm. I once joked with her, "Miss Ma, if you wore Indian women's clothing and ran on the road, I guarantee those Indians would start trying to become relatives with you!"</p>
<p>She smiled sweetly and scolded me for gossiping like everyone else! —And made me appreciate the beauty of snow in charcoal for a while.</p>
<h3>Crispy Plum Peddler</h3>
<p>— Zhu Shaofei</p>
<p>In summer, people are a bit lazy, especially in the afternoon. Sitting in the house, you feel a bit sleepy. It is said that eating sour things can wake you up, and only plums are the most delicious sour things. In the countryside, during the busy silkworm season, when "picking naps" or when the silkworms go up the mountain to "pick cocoons," if you get tired late at night, you pick a few from the plum tree, mix them with some salt, and eating them will wake you up. So in my hometown (Dongshan), plums are regarded as the only wonderful product for relieving sleepiness.</p>
<p>When the season enters summer, you can hear the cries of crispy plum peddlers in the villages from time to time. The crispy plum peddler's load has a round wooden bucket on one end and a square wooden tray with grids on the other. There are seven or eight kinds of plums of different sizes in the grids. The waxy yellow plums you choose are lined with a green mulberry leaf. Chewing two halves in one bite is indeed very crispy.</p>
<p>"Crispy plums, oh..." A series of loud and long calls pass from the entrance of the alley, gradually reaching the front of my house. The load stops under the shade of the big elm tree. Then comes the sound of "da, da," the sound of tapping the ash from the tip of the dry tobacco pipe. We children listen and come out happily to stand beside the load. The plum peddler is an old man with a white mustache and a thin braid with countable hairs. He is very amiable. Sometimes he touches our heads, or picks a few small crispy plums from the tray and shares them with us children, asking us to call him Old Grandpa. If we really call him Old Grandpa, he will open his mouth and smile happily. Even if there are no customers, he will stop for a long time before picking up the load and leaving. These scenes of the children with the old crispy plum peddler are now vividly in my mind.</p>
<p>It is again the season of hearing the cries of crispy plum peddlers. The same series of calls reach the alley. That old man has been dead for many years. Now the one carrying the load and calling out is his son.</p>
<h3>The Three Movements of Dealing with the World</h3>
<p>Resolve—deeply understand the essence</p>
<p>Round—social experience</p>
<p>Square—academic achievement</p>
<h3>Monk Yuanming</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xian</p>
<p>Monk Yuanming was one of the monks in a certain temple in my hometown. He was originally a normal school student from a neighboring county. He could talk, write poetry, and even write good Northern Wei-style calligraphy. Fifteen years ago, for some unknown reason, he abandoned his family and converted to Buddhism, asking the old abbot of the temple to tonsure him. The old abbot asked about his background and dared not take him in. After a few days, his family also tracked him down. His old mother and young wife forced him to go back, but he simply ignored them. The old abbot had no choice but to take him in, giving him the name Yuanming. Because he had a good foundation in learning, he had penetrated Zen principles in less than three years. His poems were also full of the Zen flavor of understanding the mind and seeing the nature. The local gentry had works of correspondence with him. At that time, he was only about twenty-five years old.</p>
<p>Another two years passed quickly. His mother and wife passed away one after another. After he returned home to take care of the funeral, he allocated half of his family property to the temple and half to the poor members of his clan. In that year, there was a war in the area, and large and small households were fleeing to avoid the disaster. Yuanming and his disciples remained peacefully in place. Three months later, the chaos subsided, but when those who had fled returned, they had lost track of Yuanming. When they asked the old abbot, they learned that a certain division commander and Yuanming were former classmates, so he took him away. A year later, Yuanming returned to the temple and bowed to the old abbot once. At that time, he was wearing a military uniform and had four guards with him, saying that he had been promoted to secretary by a certain division commander. After that, there was no news of him, and no one knew Yuanming's whereabouts.</p>
<p>Yesterday evening, a wandering ascetic monk suddenly came to my door, wearing ragged robes and straw sandals, with a gaunt appearance, holding a yellow book, saying that he was raising money for a certain temple in western Zhejiang to rebuild Buddhist statues. He bowed and asked me to donate. I took a closer look and seemed to recognize him. After questioning him further, I learned that he was Yuanming, whom I hadn't seen for ten years. According to him, he had been in the army for two years, and took the opportunity to escape. He wandered to Zhejiang, met a high-ranking monk, studied for several years, and became even more enlightened. This time, he was ordered by his master to go down the mountain to raise money to rebuild Buddhist statues. Once he had raised 3,000 gold coins, he would have completed his merits. He would then wander to Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu to visit famous mountains and ancient temples, in order to end the worldly ties and no longer seek a living in the human world, but to seek refuge in the place shown by his master.</p>
<p>After talking for a while, I only helped with two yuan because I was short of money. He bowed and thanked me and left. Before leaving, he said, "Three years later, you may be going to Shanghai. If there is a connection, there may be another chance to meet." Afterwards, some people said he was a scammer, and that there were many slippery monks and Taoists in Shanghai. But I feel that this Monk Yuanming, although not an enlightened high-ranking monk, is definitely not someone who just recites scriptures. So I wrote this down.</p>
<h3>A Change of Mates</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 4: Sight and Sound Are Not Floating Doubts but the Exchange of Letters; Life and Death Can Be Entrusted to the Generosity of Sorrowful Sighs</p>
<p>Just then, two people on the side of the street laughed heartily. Guoshi's heart skipped a beat, wondering if people were laughing at him. This street was full of acquaintances, and it would be embarrassing to be laughed at. So he straightened his face, calmed his pace, and walked step by step. When he reached the place where he and the person were supposed to meet, his heart started to beat again. Today, when he sees him, will he have a happy face? An angry face? Or will he be like usual, without any color on his face? Of course, if he's happy, that means he's sympathetic. If he's angry? Then all hope will become an illusion. If he's like usual, maybe he didn't receive the letter. He immediately added a kind of indescribable pain in his heart. His hands were behind his back, and he walked to the school with his head down. In this senior elementary school, Guoshi was a most dutiful teacher, arriving at school on time, teaching class on time, and explaining in detail to the students during class. For some reason, on this day, while sitting in the lounge waiting for class, he kept scribbling on a practice book with a pencil. His left elbow supported the edge of the table, but he used his hand to support his head. Although he had a pencil in his hand and was scribbling on the practice book, he didn't know what he was scribbling. A school servant, looking inside through the glass window, asked: Mr. Zhang, don't you have class this morning? Guoshi was called and suddenly woke up, asking: Has the class bell already rung? The school servant said: It's been ringing for ten minutes. Moreover, the bell was shaken past under the window, didn't Mr. Zhang hear it? Guoshi looked out the window, and there wasn't a single student outside the classroom. He couldn't help but laugh, picked up a book on the table, and hurriedly went to the classroom. This class was originally Chinese, and Guoshi stood on the podium and flipped through the book, trying to remember which lesson he was supposed to teach. But after flipping through seven or eight pages, he still couldn't find the place to teach. The students in the seats saw the teacher searching randomly, understood something, and called out: This class is on lesson fifteen, titled Patriotic Children. (48)</p>

<h3>Occasional Writings on the Lake (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— By Tianxu, a resident of West Lake</p>
<p>Yangshuisuan (Salicylic acid) can relieve pain and reduce fever, detoxify blood, and is mainly used to treat diphtheria. Willows during the Qingming season should be harvested for their tender shoots. Those not having experienced prolonged rain contain more effective ingredients, so it is reasonable to harvest them in season. Mugwort and calamus must be harvested during the Dragon Boat Festival because after that, continuous plum rains will diminish their effectiveness. Ancient prescriptions often specify harvest times, mostly based on the knowledge gained from investigating the nature of things. As for the Dragon Boat Festival gifts, geese and zongzi (glutinous rice dumplings) are often presented. Geese are those born in the same year, just reaching maturity at this time, to be offered to teachers. It is the filial piety of younger generations. Geese also have other uses, such as guarding the gate, watching for guests, and removing weeds and duckweed. Their droppings serve as fish feed. Their eyes, when viewing people, act like convex lenses, which is the opposite of cow eyes. The pupils of cows act as magnifying glasses, so they see children as adults, hence they are controlled by them. The pupils of geese act as reducing glasses, so even when they see adults, they perceive them as small, thus they dare to peck at them and make loud, harsh noises. During the Dragon Boat Festival, hiring a cat involves offering salted food. Cats with a light palate are more likely to hunt mice, while those who prefer salty food will steal food. This is similar to choosing a son-in-law, where one seeks a male known for his ability to scare away mice. Only those seeking an heir would seek a female. Zongzi are made with aged glutinous rice. After the plum rains, the rice will be infested with weevils, so it is steamed and stored during this time, to be used as lunch in the fields. The poet's line, "Steam ginseng and cook glutinous rice towards the eastern fields," reflects the reality of men plowing and women weaving. Summer rice paddies are prone to diseases, often with damp heat accumulating internally, leading to malaria in the autumn. Therefore, glutinous rice, which can induce sweating, is eaten with goose, also as an agent to draw out the disease, and to prevent the onset of typhoid fever and dysentery in the autumn. This is similar to the principle of vaccinating against smallpox between spring and summer to prevent its spread. In the past, during the Dragon Boat Festival, street vendors would sell festive items, calling them "mugwort tigers, peach and willow charms," for women to wear in their hair to prevent dragonflies and other insects from flying onto their heads and causing earaches. As for sachets and armbands, they always contained camphor to prevent lice between the collar and sleeves. If rhubarb was worn as an amulet, it prevented the transmission of typhoid fever. Taking Chen Wuji's San Yin Fang as if there was no time to lose, using sweating and vomiting was not enough, they used purging, enabling it to cure with a single purge. This truly is what is called "a lotus that prolongs life," each fitting the charm of the season. Therefore, I have always thought that seasonal customs lead every household and every person to follow without being taught, all willing to do things that benefit themselves and others. They become accustomed to it naturally and unconsciously, and they are not bothered by the trouble or the expense. This is what we call "decree," truly encompassing the fullness of command. It is unknown who first initiated it, but they could make the people believe and follow so readily. In today's world, everyone has the right to freedom. One can neither command nor decree. Any kind of movement, wanting it to be universally popular and spontaneously followed, is indeed extremely difficult. Therefore, I believe that in reforming and improving, what is not good should be changed. But good customs and habits should not be regarded as superstitions to be completely overthrown. We should rather pay close attention to protecting them, lest they be lost. The so-called seasonal rituals are also the rituals of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame. "Entering a country, inquire about its customs" means that the customs practiced must have deep meanings. The son enters the ancestral temple every year to perform rituals precisely because he fears not knowing the proper etiquette. If etiquette is lost, seek it in the countryside. I happened to be in a rural village during the Dragon Boat Festival and felt that the lingering mist and smoke were like the haze used for air raid defense. If air raid defense could be conducted in this way, what difficulty would there be in driving away iron birds? We could mobilize the masses to capture and eliminate them, just like catching snakes and tigers, which is not impossible. "The people can be made to follow it, but cannot be made to understand it." I have always believed that the phrase should be punctuated after "can," but sometimes it is better to read it as a whole phrase for ingenious application. For example, building towers was originally for reconnaissance, to defend against enemies and provide observation. Fearing public panic, they used divine teachings to prevent immorality and delusion. Today's highways are also intended for the convenience of transportation and sightseeing, perhaps similar to the strategy of "openly repairing the plank road while secretly crossing Chencang." But if there is no defense, it can be used by the enemy. How to defend? Our ancestors had methods of mutual assistance and surveillance. Isn't today's Baojia system similar? "Ten years of instruction, aiming to destroy Wu," but at the time, they certainly did not explicitly state it to avoid provoking Wu's suspicion. "Preventing the people's mouths is more difficult than preventing rivers." Is this what is meant by "the people can be made to follow it, but cannot be made to understand it?"</p>

<h3>Physical Weakness Leads to Failure in Career - A Young Man's Letter</h3>
<p>A Western proverb says: "A sound mind in a sound body."</p>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>The Chinese people have always been physically weak, so their creativity cannot match that of foreigners. The high mortality rate among Chinese has earned them the title of "Sick Man of East Asia"! As for me, due to congenital deficiencies, I have been plagued with illnesses and pain since childhood. Unfortunately, I also developed the bad habit of masturbation, which made me even weaker. Although I later resolved to quit, it led to nocturnal emission and spermatorrhea, causing my body to deteriorate terribly. It's already remarkable that I haven't immediately gone to the gates of hell. How dare I still hope for the happiness of good health! However, I have some thoughts. The first and most painful thing is that my physical weakness has affected my career achievements. This spring, my workplace reduced staff to cut costs. Naturally, a sickly employee like me was an easy target for the boss. I lost my job. The pain in my heart is indescribable. Imagine how my frail body can withstand excessive worry? So, in less than a month, I felt headaches, tinnitus, mental fatigue (even worse than usual, because I usually feel unwell), and a lack of appetite, making me as thin as a rail, looking three parts human and seven parts ghost. My father was anxious and discussed with my mother, trying to comfort me in every way and giving me various tonics, both Western and Chinese, but to no avail. You must understand that I am the only son, and my father fears the family line will end if I die. So, I never stopped seeking treatment. This March (leap March), a friend of my father introduced me to "Shengzhisu" (Reproduction Essence), and I gradually felt its effect. At first, I only felt mentally comfortable and slept well. Later, my appetite gradually increased, and my energy doubled. At the same time, headaches, tinnitus, spermatorrhea, and other symptoms disappeared without a trace. Now, my muscles are full, and I can work ten hours a day as if nothing happened. My father is overjoyed, telling everyone how effective "Shengzhisu" is. I found a job on the Dragon Boat Festival. My achievement today is due to the greatness of "Shengzhisu." At the same time, I cannot forget "Hemetol's Solidifying Essence Pills," because they were the major contributor to curing my nocturnal emission and spermatorrhea. I think there must be many young people with similar conditions as me. So, I specially wrote this letter to wish</p>
<p>You the same happiness as me.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Liu Gongmin</p>
<h3>Kettle-Removing-From-Under-the-Fire Method for Treating Spermatorrhea</h3>
<p>— Physician Zhou Xiaohan</p>
<p>The most deadly spermatorrhea, when discussed, will make you shudder. Often a promising young man, due to masturbation, has weakened sperm ducts, leading to semen leakage. Eventually, neurasthenia (nervous exhaustion) plagues him until the moment of his death. Such chronic suicide leads to countless lives being transferred to the underworld every year! So, the most dangerous venereal disease is spermatorrhea.</p>
<p>Some young people suffer from headaches, tinnitus, palpitations, dizziness, insomnia, mental fatigue, and emaciation caused by spermatorrhea. All kinds of neurasthenia symptoms will come in droves, resulting in a lack of vitality and severe stimulation, even causing mental confusion and anxiety. Naturally, if one personally experiences the pain of neurasthenia, it is equivalent to being deprived of the happiness of life. As a result, some may become cynical and commit suicide.</p>
<p>The most important point is that patients should recognize that although spermatorrhea is a serious condition, it is not a hopeless tragedy. As long as you take Hemetol's "Solidifying Essence Pills," which have the ability to strengthen the sperm ducts and replenish semen, you can get unparalleled benefits. Not only will your spermatorrhea be quickly cured, but you will also be able to restore your fertility. To put it thoroughly, your testicles inside the body can still be kept intact. Therefore, only by using Hemetol's "Solidifying Essence Pills" to cure spermatorrhea can you truly adopt a "kettle-removing-from-under-the-fire" method.</p>
<h3>Utilizing Medicinal Power to Prevent Gonococci from Entering</h3>
<p>— Physician Yu Bofu</p>
<p>Reliable Prevention and Self-Treatment</p>
<p>Safely Resist Gonorrhea… Internal Yellow Pigment Medication Achieves Success</p>
<p>Because contracting gonorrhea is too easy, coupled with its complexity and difficulty to cure, people feel infinite pain and terror. Therefore, everyone wants to use various preventive methods to block the invasion of gonococci, which is indeed an urgent task. The effectiveness of the previous methods could not gain people's trust, and their knowledge about technical problems was also unsatisfactory and reassuring.</p>
<p>Just like any disease, the most advanced medicine today requires focusing on prevention methods. The previous preventive methods can be said to be passive prevention. Now, the system of institutionalized prostitution has not yet been effectively controlled and improved, so the record of gonorrhea transmission is rapidly advancing. A thorough and fundamental prevention method is urgently needed. Now, with the advent of the yellow pigment preparation for internal use, "An Di Lin" (Safely Resist Gonorrhea), a new path for gonorrhea treatment has been found. It is praised by those who have taken it and unanimously considered the most convenient and effective medicine for self-treatment. However, rather than using this medicine after contracting gonorrhea, it is more worthwhile to swallow a few pills of "An Di Lin" beforehand. Because "An Di Lin" has a strong power to penetrate the membrane and kill bacteria, swallowing it beforehand will make it difficult for gonococci to enter. Even if they do enter, they will not easily proliferate. Because the medicinal power of "An Di Lin" is powerful, it can completely eliminate them in a few minutes!</p>
<h3>Maintaining the Amazing Success of Male and Female Youth</h3>
<p>— Physician Liu Zhimin</p>
<p>According to an article published by European and American medical scientists in a magazine, the human lifespan can indeed reach 160 years for men, and although women tend to age faster than men, they can at least live to 120 years. Regardless of gender, people who die at 100 years old are considered short-lived! However, the average Chinese person can only live to 30 years old, and it is rare to find one person out of a hundred who can enjoy a high age of over 80 years. European and American medical scientists did not issue this opinion without a basis; they based it entirely on medical principles and conducted various experiments. The reason they determined that humans can live over 100 years is because they can use medical remedies to maintain constant youth. This is not an ideal, because modern scientific inventions are all promoted by human intelligence. Looking at how Austrian physiologist Steinach invented "Shengzhisu" (Reproduction Essence) made from reproductive gland extracts, men and women have benefited from the tonifying power of "Shengzhisu" for men and women, which allows all human cells to gradually metabolize, the blood is replenished, and the supply will not be exhausted. Therefore, one can maintain constant youth, and the complexion turns ruddy. Furthermore, the greatness of "Shengzhisu" can be built upon the entire body in a very short time. Taking it regularly will double energy and increase weight. In women, it can also make the breasts plump and increase fitness and beauty. These are all the driving forces for maintaining people's youth. Diseases will not occur, and health is not a problem. Therefore, it is certain that 60 years of age is not the end of life for people taking "Shengzhisu"!</p>
<p>Venereal Disease Lecture</p>

<p>(1) Although Leucorrhea (white vaginal discharge) is Healed, Sexual Urgency Continues to Come</p>
<p>After gonorrhea lasts for a long time, the body is bound to show signs of decline due to excessive consumption. If the recuperation is not good, neurasthenia (nervous exhaustion) will inevitably be difficult to avoid. Therefore, those suffering from spermatorrhea, sexual urgency, and other symptoms, besides being caused by masturbation, gonorrhea is the main reason.</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Ma, nearly 30 years old, has suffered from gonorrhea that recurs from time to time for four years. Last spring, it relapsed once, and he recovered by taking "An Di Lin" (Safely Resist Gonorrhea). After half a year, the disease did not occur, and a doctor's examination proved that no gonococci were present. Last winter, he returned to his hometown to marry under his mother's orders, but unexpectedly, on the wedding night, he felt sexually urgent and weak. Mr. Ma was greatly alarmed and sought treatment urgently. This spring, he resided in Shanghai and came to me for medical treatment. I prescribed "Shengzhisu" (Reproduction Essence), which has the strongest effect of nourishing the reproductive glands, and sure enough, the condition turned around, and the disease of sexual urgency disappeared completely.</p>
<p>(2) Masturbation, Spermatorrhea, and Incomplete Development</p>
<p>The soundness and health of human body development are closely related to future health. Therefore, during the period of development, all methods of health preservation must conform to the norm. If development has not yet reached maturity, one must not engage in masturbation, otherwise the danger is worrying.</p>
<p>Patient Yu Zhigang is now 19 years old. When he was developing at 17 years old, his desires were impulsive, and he could not control himself, so he indulged in masturbation every day, causing spermatorrhea, which caused a great blow to his development, resulting in small parts and a weak and sickly body. This spring, he came to me for diagnosis and treatment. I used "Hemetol's Solidifying Essence Pills" to treat his spermatorrhea and "Shengzhisu" (Reproduction Essence) to nourish him. After three weeks, his weight gradually increased, and all parts of his body regained development.</p>
<h3>Treatment for Rheumatism and Bone Pain</h3>
<p>— Physician Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>We often show signs of decline before reaching old age, even suffering from kidney deficiency, back pain, muscle pain, and joint soreness. These kinds of pain are purely due to the usual exposure to wind and cold, and the residual toxins accumulate internally. When one is young and healthy, due to strong resistance, they are hidden in the body. As soon as there is an opportunity, they seize the chance to attack. This disease is more common in middle-aged and elderly people, and it is almost a universal phenomenon. That is, the colloquial saying "fa jieqi" (seasonal onset) means that one will feel bone pain at the edge of the season. If it is not cured early, it will become a lifelong incurable disease, which is very harmful. Among the medicines on the market that mainly treat rheumatism and bone pain, "John Sten's Bone Pain Pills" are the most prominent. This medicine not only cures all bone pain, but also prevents stroke and uremia, and is highly effective in preventing arteriosclerosis. Those who feel the pain of bone pain may wish to buy and try it, which can make the joints comfortable and the waist and back light and healthy, as if they are two different people from before.</p>
<h3>Pathological Inquiries</h3>
<p>Strange Disease in Women</p>
<p>I am 29 years old, and I have never been ill since I developed at the age of 15. Recently, I suddenly suffered a strange disease. My menstrual periods are irregular, sometimes coming every ten days, sometimes not coming for several months, or lasting for more than ten days when they come. I have consulted doctors for treatment, but it has been ineffective. Also, after my period comes, I cannot move. What is the pathology of this disease? What medicine should I take? Xu Yuezhen asks</p>
<p>Answer It is probably a disease of the ovaries. For internal medicine, "Shengzhisu" (Reproduction Essence) for women is the best. Taking it can adjust menstruation and nourish your overall health. At the same time, one should not overwork during menstruation.</p>
<p>Repeatedly Quit but Cannot Succeed</p>
<p>I am deeply addicted to smoking, and I have repeatedly tried to quit but cannot succeed. The smoking cessation medicines on the market are not very reliable, and my body is weak, and I am afraid of other changes. I earnestly request you to show me a better medicine so that I can quit as soon as possible. I will be grateful! Wang Wanhe启 (begins)</p>
<p>Answer Although there are many kinds of smoking cessation medicines, they are all close to being substitutes for opium. Since your body is already weakened, you should use "Shengzhisu" (Reproduction Essence) to nourish it. At the same time, inject Yuweici's health-preserving injection, which may help you quit safely and without any impact on your body.</p>
<p>Leucorrhea like Pus</p>
<p>I had my period at the age of 11, but according to people, it is not good to have your period too early, and it is harmful to your body. Is this true? I am now 19 years old, and although I am not getting sick, I have a lot of leucorrhea, which is like pus and smelly. Please tell me what medicine can treat it. Sun Huaying</p>
<p>Answer The earliness or lateness of menstruation has nothing to do with leucorrhea. Leucorrhea is related to the body's nutrition and local cleanliness. Your leucorrhea should be treated quickly. Using "Liao Dai Ling" (Healing Leucorrhea Elixir) externally is the most reliable way to treat it.</p>
<p>Severe Stomach Pain</p>
<p>I am suffering from severe stomach pain, and I have nowhere to turn when it hurts. Please quickly show me a good medicine to treat it. Chen Wen</p>
<p>Answer Your illness can be cured by taking "Wei Tong Ling" (Stomach Pain Elixir) and "Jian Wei Su" (Stomach Strengthening Element).</p>
<h3>Case Studies of Clinical Visits to Venereal Disease and Smoking Cessation Departments</h3>
<p>— Wu Dachao, Bachelor of Medicine, University of Hong Kong Medical School</p>
<p>Gonorrhea Relapse, Frequent Dangerous Symptoms</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Wei, 31 years old, from Sichuan, is a businessman in Shanghai. (Main Complaint)——Gonorrhea relapse. Cystitis pain. Blood in urine. Loss of vitality. (Medical History)——Mr. Wei got gonorrhea due to social interactions in the business world. He hastily took medicine without choosing carefully and mistakenly sought treatment from a quack doctor, accumulating poison internally. He tried taking inferior medicines, turning acute symptoms into chronic ones. Whenever he overworked, the gonorrhea would relapse immediately, with frequent dangerous symptoms and unbearable pain. He first suffered from funiculitis. In early spring, he suffered from cystitis, blood in his urine, turbid urination, and loss of vitality. His body and mind were devastated. Last month, he was introduced by his close friend Mr. Kuang to a diagnosis. (Treatment)——I instructed him to purchase "An Di Lin" (Safely Resist Gonorrhea) from the China-England Pharmacy, which has the effect of penetrating the membrane and killing bacteria, eliminating inflammation, relieving pain, promoting diuresis, purifying turbidity, settling throbbing, and eliminating swelling. After taking five boxes in a row, the dangerous symptoms were eliminated first, and the gonorrhea was completely eradicated. Even when he encounters overwork, it never recurs.</p>
<p>Spermatorrhea, Smoking Cessation, Quickly Break Addiction</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Mao, 45 years old, from Zhejiang, is a worker. (Main Complaint)——Restlessness from quitting smoking. Mental and physical pain. Spermatorrhea has also appeared. Mental exhaustion. (Medical History)——Mr. Mao has been addicted for many years. At first, he intended to smoke to boost his spirits. Over time, it turned into numbness, and his spirits became more exhausted. He repeatedly took tonics, but none were effective. He repeatedly sought to quit, but could not succeed. Fortunately, he was introduced to me by Mr. Liu, who had safely quit smoking at my place. (Treatment)——I learned that Mr. Mao also had spermatorrhea and his nerves were also in a weakened state. Other tonics and quitting methods would not be effective. I immediately instructed him to purchase "Hemetol's Solidifying Essence Pills," a famous medicine for spermatorrhea, from Wing On Company to treat his spermatorrhea. I prescribed the safe smoking cessation and nourishing Holy Medicine "Shengzhisu" (Reproduction Essence) to eliminate toxins, break the addiction, treat his weakness, and replenish his losses. The effects were remarkable after taking it. Because Mr. Mao urgently sought to shorten the quitting period, I also injected him with (Yuweici's Health-Preserving Injection). Therefore, he safely quit smoking, and the period was shortened by ten days compared to Mr. Liu.</p>

<p>Talking Points</p>
<h3>The Southwest Shows Hope for Resolution</h3>
<p>— He</p>
<p>According to yesterday's telegram from Beijing, the Military Affairs Commission issued a personnel order on the 13th, appointing Yu Hanmou as the Director of Pacification of Guangdong, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, and concurrently Commander of the 1st Army of the 4th Army. Yu has already left Beijing on the same day to return to his defense area. There is hope for a resolution of the situation in Guangdong. However, according to a telegram from Hong Kong, Huang Xuchu suggested that Guangdong and Guangxi strengthen economic cooperation, and Guangdong agreed to allocate 20 million to help Guangxi. Huang immediately returned to Nanning by plane. The saying that Miao Peinan was executed by shooting, if viewed in light of the second message, means that the situation in Guangdong and Guangxi is still difficult to be optimistic about.</p>
<p>The saying goes, "The three treasures of a country are land, people, and politics." Therefore, these three are the lifeblood of establishing a country, and not private rights to be protected. The authorities in Guangdong and Guangxi have disobeyed the orders of the central government, forming a situation of separatism, which has lasted for several years, so that the domestic politics cannot be fully on track, and it is seen as a disorderly country. This responsibility is difficult for the Southwest authorities to evade, because a country with more than two governments, each governing separately and not under the same jurisdiction, this kind of畸形 organization is rarely seen in other countries. If there is no unity internally, how can there be anything to say externally?</p>
<p>"Settle the internal affairs before resisting external aggression" is originally a fixed step. If the internal affairs are not settled, the strength is scattered, and there is naturally no ability to resist external aggression. Now that the situation in North China is precarious, the authorities in Guangdong and Guangxi are still using the beautiful name of resisting the enemy and carrying out the strategy of disrupting the rear, which is helping the enemy to attack themselves. If this situation is not first solved, there will be no results externally, and it will lead to destruction internally. Therefore, Mr. Yu Hanmou said that spiritual unity and unified national salvation are the fundamental plans. If there is no unity, how can there be unification? If there is no unification, how can there be national salvation? The trend of the situation cannot be denied.</p>
<p>Our country is a scientifically backward country, and most of our military supplies depend on various countries. If the forces are not divided and united to resist the disaster, we are still worried that it will be difficult to control the chances of victory. If we are divided into two, the effectiveness of resisting foreign aggression will be even smaller. If the Southwest cannot take care of the overall situation and ends up resisting the central government, then if a civil war breaks out, the country will be destroyed immediately. Every point of strength lost in the civil war is a point of strength reduced against foreign aggression. If this valuable strength is wasted in the civil war, how can it not be a pity?</p>
<p>Therefore, no matter how the Southwest authorities propagandize, no matter how strongly they argue, if they violate the eight characters of spiritual unity and unified national salvation, they are traitors to the country and abandoned by the people. Under the current circumstances, there is no other good strategy to save the country other than to unite consistently and fully resist the disaster. It is necessary to eliminate the concepts of private grievances and private interests as much as possible, and to reorganize the situation of separatism and division, otherwise, there will only be mutual destruction.</p>
<h3>Starving Man</h3>
<p>— Lin Na</p>
<p>In the middle of July, I took leave from Zhoufu and came to Manila. As I came out of the train station, I immediately thought of De. He was my colleague from the time I was in Lao Fu Man, a quiet young man. I walked, stepping into the not-so-familiar courtyard, full of mud and dampness, surrounded by a collapsed fence, and only after climbing a dirty, corroded staircase did I reach that small, airless room. He had lived here for more than four months, and during these four months, he had been living in a state of semi-starvation.</p>
<p>The door was ajar, I knocked lightly twice, and then pushed it open. The room was so dark, without sunlight, and not a breath of fresh air could be felt. The stench of alcohol and the smell of corroded mildew filled the air. I stood outside the door for a while, feeling only faintness and silence. But soon I saw in that tiny corner a cot, on which lay a gaunt, half-naked human body.</p>
<p>He was breathing so peacefully and evenly, his mouth gaped wide to one side, his whole body curled up like a caterpillar. How sweetly he slept! Thinking this, I walked in and sat down on an orange crate.</p>
<p>The room was very cramped, filled with bottles, dirty shirts, and a few books with torn covers, lying scattered haphazardly on the floor, on the table, and on the wooden shelves. I carefully scrutinized every object and thing. After about five minutes, suddenly the half-naked body stirred slightly, and then I heard a low, weak sigh. He was awake. His tired, burning eyes stared at me in surprise, and after a moment, he murmured faintly: "It's you! My friend, you've come at just the right time!" Then he turned his eyes away from me, to the other side, and thoughtfully climbed out of bed, softly humming a popular, vulgar song.</p>
<p>I didn't say a word. How surprised I was by his abnormal behavior! Was this how a warm-hearted friend would treat me with such coldness? I lowered my head in anguish.</p>
<p>He silently and unhurriedly picked up his clothes from the bed and the rack and put them on. The turbid, stifling alcoholic fumes, like his whistling, swirled around the room, clearly showing that his drunkenness had not completely worn off. He put on his dirty shirt, pulled on his grease-stained work pants, and then snatched an old straw hat from the rack, put it on, and told me in a low voice: "Now, it's time for us to go, my friend. I believe you've just returned from Zhoufu. You mustn't be feeling tired, right?" I shook my head, and then he let out a hysterical laugh and ran down the stairs.</p>
<p>Passing through the accumulated mud and the collapsed old fence, a turn led to the street. The July sun was blazing, it was already about ten o'clock, the street was very quiet, and a few carriages, driven by panting, skinny horses, were lazily running along. We silently chose the shady places to walk, he had become so melancholy and depressed, alcohol had completely ruined him. After about fifteen minutes, he suddenly stopped at the entrance of a basement pub, his eyes shining with suspicious light, glancing at me. His thin lips, tinged with purple-black, trembled slightly. Without much delay, the filthy door swallowed him up. After a moment of contemplation, I followed him in.</p>
<p>The waiter expertly filled his glass, and he, without saying a word, fixed his burning eyes on the glass and took a large gulp. Then, his cheeks turned from pale to flushed, and his eyes shot out blazing flames.</p>
<p>"My friend," he exclaimed excitedly, a cunning smile on his face, "I think you must be very surprised." I softly spoke my thoughts, and he laughed loudly. "You are now a gentleman, and I, what am I? An unemployed man, a starving man waiting for the end to come. From friends, you may have heard what a bad life I've been living. Because I love my country, I constantly exposed in society their schemes to buy enemy goods in large quantities and deceive their own compatriots by changing the labels to domestic products, so they dismissed me, completely driving me into a state of starvation. However, I believe in myself, there is nothing wrong with loving my country! You see, I drink heavily; that doesn't matter, my friend, you must know that I am creating a career for my own beliefs."</p>
<p>His words were so casual and disorganized that I felt he was just talking drunkenly, so I knitted my brows in doubt. But he called out seriously:</p>
<p>"You don't believe me?" Then he shook his head despairingly and said: "You are already a gentleman, we are not on the same path, so you will never understand me. But, you watch, in the near future..." He angrily stood up from his seat, waved lightly towards the counter, and walked out. I was stunned, the sting in my heart made me lower my head.</p>
<p>A week later, I hurriedly returned to Zhoufu from Manila. On the way, I ran into an acquaintance, who told me that he had been arrested two days ago; because he had led many unemployed ruffians, carrying knives and bombs, to blow up those Overseas Chinese shops that sold enemy goods. I bowed my head with emotion, and murmured to myself: "De, you did the right thing!..." I felt a slight moisture in my eyes.</p>

<h3>The Courtyard</h3>
<p>— Hu Wei</p>
<p>I have returned to my hometown. When the small steamer stopped at the pier, the noisy cries of vendors and the arguments of rickshaw pullers touting for customers, that kind of familiar local accent, evoked infinite sadness in me. It has been five years since I returned to my hometown!</p>
<p>The family was very happy. They were busy cleaning up my room for me. Because my younger brother got married the year before last, three new buildings were built behind the house. My mother wanted me to live in the new house so that the brothers, who had not seen each other for many years, could be close. If I also got married soon, there would still be empty space on both sides of the new house, and the two buildings could be expanded to five or seven. But I love the courtyard in the old house. My former bedroom faced that courtyard, and I spent a lot of time and energy turning that courtyard into a small garden. Of course, in the past five years, the courtyard has collapsed beyond recognition. I told my mother that I was afraid that I would stay longer this time, and I wanted to restore the courtyard to its old appearance before moving to the new house to live with my younger brother.</p>
<p>It was already dusk, and the servants were busy cleaning my old bedroom. Closed for five years, the house had a pungent, musty smell. But the tables and chairs were very familiar to me, and were all my favorite objects. These things had been separated from me for five years, and now I felt as happy as if I had returned to the arms of an old lover. I took off my long gown and helped the servants sweep, putting the homecoming books on the bookshelf, and hanging up the pictures I liked on the walls. I put some books that I liked to read on the desk. Before dinner, the bedroom had returned to its appearance five years ago.</p>
<p>At dinner, my younger brother bought a bottle of wine, and everyone drank happily. My mother covered her face with the wine cup and began to nag about me getting married. Because it was rare for the whole family to gather together happily, I couldn't bear to hurt the old woman's heart. I agreed. In the evening, we talked in my room until very late.</p>
<p>As soon as I arrived in the countryside, my life changed immediately, and because I was thinking about the courtyard, I got up as soon as the rooster crowed behind the house. I first pushed open the window and jumped into the courtyard. In the courtyard, in addition to the osmanthus tree and the pomegranate tree, whose branches and leaves were growing more luxuriantly, the flowers and plants I planted had all become empty pots lined up on the stone slabs, and the empty space was covered with long weeds. I couldn't even see the location of the goldfish tank in front of the window. I jumped back in, took out the sickle hidden under the closet, and with a small stool, went to the courtyard to cut the grass. When the sun had risen halfway into the sky, my mother called at the door from outside. "How soundly you sleep!" she shouted as she knocked on the door.</p>
<p>I opened the door, covered in sweat and holding mud in my hands, which made my mother laugh.</p>
<p>"You're still like a child, wanting to do everything you think of. You've just come back, you should rest for a few days. Cutting grass, you can ask Afu to do it, why do you have to make such a mess?"</p>
<p>In fact, I knew that as long as I came home, my mother would be happy with anything. She immediately told the maid to pour water and bring out breakfast.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I went to visit a few relatives, which was the custom in the countryside. When I was studying, I had to visit each family during the winter and summer vacations.</p>
<p>The sun set and I returned home. My younger brother was a teacher at the village primary school, and he had to be on duty one day a week. My sister-in-law told me that he was staying at the school today. My mother had also gone out in the afternoon and had not returned. This house seemed to have changed its appearance. Since my father passed away, my mother had wanted me to get married. She said:</p>
<p>"The family is so desolate, only if both of you get married, will it be lively again..."</p>
<p>Now my younger brother is married, isn't he? But I only feel more lonely. I went back to my room, looked at the dilapidated courtyard, and roused myself to remove the weeds, only the courtyard was not unfamiliar to me!</p>
<p>My mother came back, calling my name in the main room, and the voice gradually came closer to my bedroom:</p>
<p>"Xiong'er, I've begged for many flower seeds, and I also asked your uncle for two pots of lotus flowers..." She hurriedly stepped into the room, and I was dragging a pair of shoes and standing in front of the window when she said again: "You child, really..."</p>
<p>She handed me the flower seeds, there were climbing morning glories, stone wax red, impatiens, and a few without pistils, I couldn't name them. I took the flower seeds, and felt uncomfortable again. My mother had probably gone to each family to beg for flower seeds for me for most of the day. Naturally, after my father passed away, my mother's energy was focused on the two of us brothers, but her "energy" was only hoping that we would marry wives soon so that she could hold her grandchildren as soon as possible. I couldn't accept her "energy," and for five years I had been drifting in the city, although she had written many letters, as long as I was at home, she would never tie me down to marriage. The year my younger brother got married, she urged me to come home again, but I always ignored her, year after year, until now, when I had to come home for my father's burial next month.</p>
<p>My mother knew that I liked the courtyard, knew that I liked planting flowers, and she immediately took the trouble to beg for so many flower seeds. But on the other hand, I knew her consistent "energy," she wanted to keep me at home and marry a wife as soon as possible to make her happy.</p>
<p>Sure enough, she talked to me about that matter. My mother almost shed tears, she said:</p>
<p>"Your younger brother has married, and if you don't marry, the relatives will say that I am biased. Originally, the custom in the countryside is to marry in order, but that is already breaking the rules."</p>
<p>As a son who had not returned home for five years, I could no longer hurt the old woman's heart.</p>
<p>The courtyard was gradually restored to its former appearance: the flower pots on the stone steps reflected each other in red and green, the morning glories climbed high up the wall, the leaves of the two pots of lotus flowers emerged from the water, and the goldfish were swimming in the tank. I was living in the old environment again.</p>
<p>My mother wanted me to move to the new house to live with my younger brother again. I understood what she meant, the new generation should live in new houses, which could foretell the prosperity of the family.</p>
<p>From morning to night, my younger brother was a husband with a wife, and he seemed very fascinated by his current stable life. I felt that the young people of our time were so far apart. In this family, I was a loner. Every day, I still lived a lonely life in the old bedroom (now renamed the study) facing the courtyard.</p>
<p>The courtyard was restored to its appearance five years ago under my efforts, but what about the me and my family five years ago? I often asked myself this.</p>
<p>Whether to be a bird soaring in the sky, or to be my mother's filial son, I lived in contradiction...</p>

<p>Opening "Woman Crying for Agarwood"</p>
<p>Autumn scenery, osmanthus fragrance in August. A passionate woman cries in her boudoir. Only hearing the sounds of cold insects outside the window are incessant. The wind blows the purple bamboo, rustling. The iron horses in front of the pole jingle. I lower my head secretly. I ponder. Thinking of the handsome young man from my maiden family. I married into the husband's family for less than half a month. The maid sent a message to my room. Saying that the young man had a disease in his teeth. I made a futile bow before the incense table. Praying to the heavens and the city god. I only wished him peace and happiness. I married into the husband's family for less than a month. The maid sent a message to my room. Saying that the young man had given up his life. I cried myself almost to death several times before I came back to life. The husband asked me why I was so sad. I only said that the pain in my abdomen was the hardest to bear. I should have come to mourn before the spirit. But I am only a bride who has not reached her full month. It is not convenient to mourn in the mourning hall. I have to secretly wear three points of mourning for you. And tie a piece of hemp cloth around my chest. A pair of embroidered shoes on hemp cloth. I asked the maid to buy a piece of agarwood. I carved the young man's handsome face. Carving him with a square scarf on his head, fluttering ribbon. White jade and black satin inlaid in the center. It's hard for me to carve you. Walking back and forth in the study. It's hard for me to carve you. Opening your mouth and calling me little sister. It's hard for me to carve you. Playing chess face to face, watching the West Chamber. It's hard for me to carve you. Urging me several times but it was hard to tell clearly. Only because the bridal sedan chair arrived at the hall. I had to harden my heart and say goodbye to the young man. When I got in the sedan chair, I cried sadly. Bystanders only talked idly. Only saying that I can't bear to leave my father and mother. Who knows. I can't bear to leave the affectionate and righteous handsome young man. Young man. I offer you on the dressing table during the day. In the evening. The green gauze curtain is made into a shrine. There are so many sad things in the world. Other people's sadness can be grieved. My sadness is hidden in my abdomen.</p>

Beads hanging on the chest gleam. Silk cloud trousers with embroidered flowers. Pink skirt flashing, slender waist and graceful figure. Embroidered shoes winding through the flower street. Seeing the peonies wither at the Peony Pavilion. Walking to the front of the Night Cloud Pavilion, I looked up. Seeing nine lotus lanterns hanging in front of the pavilion.
