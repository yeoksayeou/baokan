<h3 id="c8">日澳貿易點之觀察 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>自澳洲政府頒布關稅新則對於日本輸入澳洲之人造絲棉織物等加以排斥東京方面卽籌畫對付及報復之方外務大藏及工商三省當局積極會商工商省且已草定應戰方略對於澳洲輸入日本之羊毛及麥加以定額之限制如輸入超過定額則絕對禁止假使此項計畫實現其有效期將爲三年日澳關係之惡化卽日英友誼之破裂亦卽遠東風雲之加度緊張也</p>
<p>據同盟社所傳消息日本政府及工商界對於澳洲政府此决舉動頗爲憤慨朝野囂囂侈言報復日本毛織業同盟每年輸進澳洲羊毛六十萬包近已舉行會議擬自南非洲及南美洲一帶定購羊毛以代替澳洲之貨物棉織業會社及人造絲織業會社等八種組織亦在大阪舉行聯席會議决爲政府之後盾大阪商會之海外貿易部亦請求政府用一切報復之方法以對抗澳洲最可注意者全國重要報紙莫小著論攻擊澳國其態度之强硬視政府與工商界允有過之</p>
<p>日澳貿易戰之不可避免及經濟之戰爭將有嚴重之政治結果蓋可以斷言澳洲此决毅然排斥日貨已有甚大之决心其主動力右於英國亦至明顯日本駐澳洲村井總領事曾向澳洲關稅大臣致公文表示抗議並要求其反省澳洲之答復日方認爲無誠意現巳再度抗議表示日本朝野之重大决意耍求澳洲切實答覆交涉之破裂蓋最近將來之事也日本之羊毛原料仰賴澳洲棉織人造絲之市塲澳洲亦佔重要部份商戰結果孰利孰害明眼者自能洞然也</p>
<p>夫日本之覬覦澳洲山來已久澳洲者日本之最理想殖民地也澳洲人口之稀薄且勝於東北四省氣候溫暖宜於日本殖民自白澳主義盛行澳政府通過禁止日華僑民之律日本懷恨未已近日發現日八偸入澳境之事其决澳洲出產之農礦動植莫非日本之急需如羊毛如小麥如金如鐵凡爲現代產業國所必需者澳洲多能供給况澳洲以地富人稀人民之購買力極高常人富足勝於英美日貨之推銷如無阻礙則足以使大阪一帶工業獲來蘇之慶而使無數窮困無業者得免無食無衣之厄此日本不能忘情於澳洲之主因也</p>
<p>年來英國之國際地位降低在遠東方面武力更形不足雖以飛機與無錢電之發展使倫敦與澳洲新錫蘭之問關係較爲接近然在國防方而貿易方面言之則有鞭長莫及之苦澳洲人民明知一旦日本發展至赤道以南其奪取澳洲有如甕鼈欲英國之陸海空軍保護此地球另一角之殖民地頗爲困難故澳洲方面近頗有提倡依賴美國以自固者美國方面亦有提倡併在大平洋附近之各英帝國自治領以構成大英語國家同盟者日本勢力之崛起良英帝國之最大隱憂亦世界地圖變色之至重因素也</p>
<p>日本已决心與澳洲作經濟上之决戰矣妥協乎抵抗乎有視乎倫敦方面之决心如何耳</p>

<p>春秋點滴  （鄭鳴時）　　形與影可說是因果關係的象徵；旣有形，必有影，旣有因，亦有果，其形影，因果間反映的本能，原是相等的；所以有大有小，有重有輕者，祇不過是光綫的支配與環境的傾使罷了。　　每一個人的性情和他的動作，言語，一切所表現出來的，都有連貫性的存在。無論做作得如何不自然；或卽使是瘋了；而你的動態中還是懷孕着己身的性情。好似有一個範圍一樣，只要是你所表現出來，總不能逃出這個為性情所統制的範圍。　　世界上一切事物的存在，均有其意義，假使你覺得它沒有意義，那只能說你不曾發覺它的意義，而不能說它本身沒有意義。胡漢民先生軼事  勉厂　　中常會主席胡漢民先生，突然逝，噩耗傳來，舉國震悼。其事業文章，功在黨國，固已彪炳史冊，永垂千　，無待遨述。茲摭拾一二遺聞瑣事，聊供讀者之談助耳。　　粵人多嗜辣，而胡獨異，余　每招胡飲，雖具粵饌，必去辣味，從其好也。胡於食物無所擇，惟極嗜　蜞，一日佛厂宴胡，備　蜞甚豐；胡食之而甘，據座大嚼，嘗自詡為平生最暢快之一餐。　　胡有夜起之習慣，每籌思黨國大事，或撰作重要文字，於夜半忽然起身離床，凝神貯思，旣而復睡，則已成竹在胸，指揮若定矣。　　胡作詩文，喜用腹稿，其經意之作品，嘗沈思累日，或逾月而不下筆，及腹稿旣成，則奮翰疾譬，如江河之瀉。至於尋常應酬之作，則不假思索，亦不易一字。　　胡公餘之暇，絕不喜世俗之娛樂，惟以翰墨自遺，於漢隸曹全碑，工力最深，為人書聯或題字，必集曹全。嘗示余以醉德堂記一篇，長千餘言，悉集曹全字。胡於近人書法，少所許可，獨推重浙江馬公愚，嘗謂能精四體，工力悉稱者，當以公愚為最。野獸羣中之旅館  （大千）　　非洲野獸之多，為世所稱，於是有好事者就非洲西海岸中部英屬堪雅殖民地Ke　nyaColony境內野獸尤為繁盛之區，闢旅館以供遊客飽覽人類所不易見到之野獸自然活動情況大觀，可稱旅遊之別開生面，而世界旅館中之最奇特者也。旅館以外，四顧曠野無人居，奇特一，旅館全部建築於高大之樹頂，如有巢氏之架木為屋然，奇特二；旅館租金每日每房每人須五十美金，合國幣百六十餘元，駭人聽聞，奇特三；如此昂貴之房金，有類敲詐，論理英之殖民地當局，必將出而干涉，但英之殖民地政府久已熟知之而不加過問，則以凡曾在其中一宿者，咸滿意於所見而去，從無不平之嗚也。旅客之進旅館，有汽車接候，車資即包於房金內，不另計算，車上有一武裝土人及一執槍之術士，以資保護，旣達旅館所在地，由樹下木梯攀援而登，以達旅舍，旅舍之四周有鐵網絡圍繞，以防野獸之侵襲，旅館中共有二室，洗澡房及其附屬設備齊全，並有一小發電機，以供給全旅館之燈光，室外有長廊圍繞，頗便縱目遠眺，野獸至旅館附近，禁止射擊，以故獸皆不甚避人，距旅館不遠處有一鹽源，遠近野獸，不時前來舐食，成獸集焉。所有獸羣中相爭相奪，弱肉强食，如獅虎之撲捉斑馬，羚羊，以及象隊之叫囂而至，駭走其他弱獸之情視，咸可歷歷呈現於旅客之前。人夜則百獸叫號，雜然而作，可怖可悲之情景，非會在其中寄宿一宵者，殆不克形容想像其萬一，故雖房金駭人聽聞，往遊者仍須早為登記，乃可獲得一棲之機會焉。富貴花  淸癯　　周子愛蓮說，「牡丹，花之富貴者也，」是牡丹為「富貴花，」此一語定之矣；然皮日休詩，「落盡殘紅始吐芳，佳名喚作百花王，競誇天下無雙絕，獨占人間弟一香，」不獨、「富貴」而月有當王者氣象，歐陽修牡丹記云，一姚黃者，千葉黃花，出於民間姚氏家，魏家花者，千葉紅花，出於魏相仁溥家，」錢思公嘗曰，「人謂牡丹花王，今姚黃眞可為花王，而魏花乃后也；」牡丹之榮寵，有如是者。　　楊太眞外傳，「禁中牡丹得數本，紅紫淺黃通白者，移植於沉香亭畔，花開，上乘照夜白，妃以步輦從，李龜年手捧檀板，押衆樂前，上曰，賞名花，對妃子，焉用舊詞為，遽命持金花箋，宣賜李白，立進淸平樂，第三首，名花傾國兩相歡，長得君王帶笑看，解釋春風無限恨，沉香亭北倚欄干，」又全唐詩話，「唐明皇謂陳修已曰，今京邑人傳牡丹詩認為首，修已對曰，李正封詩，天香夜染衣，國色朝酣酒，時，楊妃侍上，曰妝臺前宜飲以一紫金盞酒，則正封之詩見矣；」又「西京牡丹聞於天下，花盛時，人守作萬花會，宴集之所，以花為屏帳，至於梁棟柱拱，悉以竹筒貯水，簮花釘掛，舉目皆花也，「牡丹之著於載籍，固非凡卉幽花可比爾。　　牡丹譜云，「在中州洛陽為第一，布蜀天彭為第一，川民嘗買洛中新花以婦，天彭之花，遂冠兩川，彭人謂多葉者京花，單葉者川花云。」又云剔治各有其法，謂才弄花，有弄花一年，看花十日之語，」此皆陸放翁所著牡丹譜之說，而儈仲殊花品序，有云「越中牡丹開時，賞者不問親疏，謂之看花局；此月多有輕雲微雨，謂之養花天；」若淸異錄戰「漢偽臣到關，見洛陽杜丹，大駭歎，有縉紳謂曰，此名大北勝，」助因人而言，物以人重已；西漢叢話，「牡丹為貴客，」而羣若譜，謂「牡丹一名鹿韭，一名百兩金；」今有名「月宮白，」「小黃嬌，」「雪夫人，」「粉奴香，」「御衣紅，」「三雲紫，」「百葉仙人，」太平樓閣，」皆崇高無比之名詞，而為香國中所稱羨不已者，余故備述之名曲獨奏  中　換巢鸞鳳  張恨水著　　　第二回　芳草麗人天微波乍托　小樓明月夜好夢初溫　　究竟是春天了，到山上來遊歷的人，很是不少。上山的人行道上，陸陸續續的不斷有人走着。國器先是順了路走，覺得遊人嘻嘻哈哈，很掃人家的淸興，便繞到方後面，向一個山頂上走去。這裏有一個叫方亭子，四面的風，都要由這亭子裏穿過。人上山以後，微微的喘着氣，背上不斷冒着熱汗，臉也會紅紅的。國器手上揭下了呢帽，踏進亭子去，只覺那東南風呼呼的由身邊過去，身上很是感到凉爽，就停住了沒有走。亭子角上有兩個賣雨花石的小販，各陳列着兩口木盆，裏面放滿了淸水大小五花的鵝卵石子，在水裏映着，彷佛是格外好看。木盆邊有一張小桌子，放了幾隻洗臉盆，和幾雙尺多長的筷子專門頂備給客人挑選五花石用的。還有－列細瓷碗，放在桌上。裏面也是用淸水浸了五花石。國器小站了一會，不免也走到石子攤邊去看看。這件事也是覺得很奇怪，猛然的看到水裏浸着的石子，那都是很好的。等了自己筷拿子去撥動着，那石子又很平常了。國器取了一雙長筷子，只管仲到水盆裏去撥動石子，以便在那裏而挑出一兩塊好的石頭來。正出着神在看呢，耳朶邊，却聽到有個人嬌滴滴的說：雨花台上沒有什麼風景，可是站在這裏，四週一望，這晾致狠有意思。國器抬頭看時，正是那位每日遇到的姑娘。他今日穿着一件淡靑的竹布短褂子，却是左大襟，一排琵琶襟紐扣。下面穿了一條靑湖縐裙子，被風吹得飄飄然，露出裙子下面，一雙窄窄的平口黑皮鞋，套在雪白的襪子上。他那烏黑的頭上，另拖了一小仔頭髪，由前額搬到大辮子根上。小辮子前，紮了一朶小小的紅綢花。他全身都是淡素的，唯有這一點鮮艷，更覺得這丯姿是嫵媚動人。他身後隨有兩個少婦，裝束都很時髦，似乎是一家人。他將手向南一指道，嫂嫂你們看，一片芳草接着遠處的村莊樹木，看到，就讓人心裏大大的痛快一陣。這就叫芳草天涯了。一個小婦笑道：二妹子跟我們摔文，那是對牛彈琴。他微微的笑了，又輕輕的歎了一口氣道：這麼好好的天氣，應該是我們少年人的天氣……他一面說着話，一面轉過身來，這才看到國器閑閑的站在一邊，也在向四處眺望着。他先是很自在的說話，到了這時，也不知道什麼緣故，平常的臉，色自然的抹上胭脂了。（二八）遊踪所至歐征隨錄（上）  朱學範　　余此次奉中央指派為第二十屆國際勞工大會出席代表，並為第二十一屆海事會勞方代表秘書，用於四月二十四日搭乘意輸ConteVirde號出國，是晨猥蒙各界人士曁工友同志蒞輪歡送，誼情優渥，感愧交縈。船旣啟椗，彌覺依戀，越吳淞口，大海茫茫，回視上海，則已不復辨矣。　　途次風平浪靜，海景殊佳。同船出國者，除趙班斧同志外，聞有上海市政府黃秘書劍棻，故船中至不寂寞。間或據案小談，或遠眺海景，莫不放趣，舟行頗速，光陰易逝，爰乃經香港，越西買，而以四月卅日上午七時抵星加坡矣。　　船旣達埠，承當地各新聞記者詢及國內情形，並請發表談話。余乃告以余出國前之國難嚴重狀態，諸如華北之危機，共匪之擾亂，內患外侮，禍害類仍；益以農村之破產，都市之不景氣，因而造成農人之度日維艱，工人失業人數之日增。末復告以政府人民團結一致，埋首建設，積極訓練，以作非常時期之準備等各種情形，記者等均滿意而去。　　星加坡為英人殖民地，地為一小島，人口綦夥，凡四十餘萬，僑胞佔三十餘萬，胥屬閩粵兩省人士。歐人僅六千餘，此外則馬來，印度，亞拉伯人而已。船到埠時，即蒙星洲日報經理胡昌耀君蒞船招待，並邀余及班斧赴報館參觀。該報規模甚大，日出一萬五十餘份，為我僑胞唯一宣傳喉舌。職工共一百五十人，每日出早午報二次，早報於晨八時出版，午報於下午五時出版。新聞甚豐富，言論亦至公正而不偏頗；至於廣告，亦屬不少。查該報為胡文虎先生獨力斥資創辦，慘淡經營，維持逾年，頗費苦心。現正從事於自建房屋，今秋即將落成，預卜其巍峨勝展，前途無疆也。　　旋由胡君陪往領事館拜謁刁總領事（作謙），時上午十句鐘也，顧其時或因時間尙早之故，刁氏尙未下樓辦公，蒙施領事予以接見，余略叩星地僑工情形，即行辭出　　星洲僑胞共三十七八萬人，工人佔四之三焉，大都從事於橡膠，森林，礦業，碼頭，車夫等苦工者。近年因受市面不景氣之影響，每一工人日得工資僅三四角，至多者亦不過七八角，故生活頗為艱苦。而英人又復每年遺送印度工人約萬人以爭奪僑工工作，我僑工受此排擠，痛苦更深，　且無立足之地矣。小春秋週刋人生  （紫英）　　舍里斯勒談：「世界上是旣沒有快樂也沒有憂愁；沒有，所有的只是喜與哀的鬼臉；我們笑，我們哭，我們邀請我們的靈魂來欣賞我們的喜劇」。　　這句話是怎樣的深沉道盡了可悲的人間世啊！如果「世界不過是一個大舞台，人生只是一塲悲喜劇；」那麼，各式各樣的扮演者，有時能够心地淸澈的欣賞一切，看到別人和自己過往的醜態，能不啞然麼？趕春  蕉心　　閏三月業已終了，百廿韶光，匆匆地隨着時代的輪軸老去，一般騷人墨客，不知為傷春而歌咏出多少名句，給後人低回誦讀！可是，今年的春光，却不知躲在什應地方，竟不見一些影兒。蘇子瞻的卜算子後半截云：﹁纔是送春歸，又送君歸去！若到江南趕上春，千萬和春住！」現在的時令雖然已經不是春，但是氣候還和春一樣，趕到江南，正趕得上春呢。竹與笋  闌刪　　竹淸呂也；笋，雋味也。　　謝富貴，隱居不仕者，多愛竹，　　之曰君子。宅邊籬畔，不可無三竿兩竿之竹，以自娛自表也　　蘇東坡氏最喜啖夢，故亦愛竹。其言曰：「安寗食無肉，不可居無竹；無肉令人瘦，無竹令入俗。若敎不瘦又不俗，頓頓還他笋炒肉。」旣饕餮成性，又須博雅號，故亦不得不出以「二者可以得兼」之妙語也。東坡誠妙人哉！　　又有某塾師，見其窮學生每逢年下各節令，僅送夾節敬三分，乃出聯屬對曰：「竹笋出牆，一節須高一節。「蓋暗諷之也。學生解其意，對聯云：「梅花遜雪，三分只是三分。」民謠  （馬廷龍）　　日落西山漸漸黃，畫眉籠掛拉北紗窗，　　畫眉籠無食難過夜，小奴房中無主郎勿進房。　　日落西山漸漸黃，小姐掮棒打黃狼，　　莫說黃狼身短小脚會偷雞，爹娘莫怪囡年輕會偷郎。　寓意齋隨筆  寓意　　據英文大陸報周刋載：美國現任大總統羅斯福之父，曾在中國產茶區域為「嘗茶者」。此種「嘗茶者」為茶商所雇，產茶者之茶葉，必經若輩「嘗」，然後評其優劣，定其價格。據謂：業此嘗茶者，非有十年努力，極難成為專家，而一經成名，薪水甚豐，每月可得三千元云。　　英國文豪約翰生，少時貧甚，當在大學肆業時，衣服破敗，形容委瑣，有某同學見其鞋已破碎，而久不更換，憐之。一日，淸晨，為置新鞋一雙於其宿舍之門外，意以贈之。初不料約翰生啓扉而出，見之大怒，竟將此一雙新鞋擲之百步之外。信不信由你  王志欽　　全世界共有二百八十六萬輛汽車，其中汽車數量最多者，為德國，有七十五萬輛之多。　　上海除里弄街巷外，共有馬路六百五十一條，長度最長者，為華界之中山路。　　獅子的身體雖大，但在各種猛獸中，以獅子的心臟為最小。　　至聖先師孔老夫子因幼時家境艱難，只讀三年零四個月書，他的學問道德，完全由於自己刻苦自修而得。　　肚中生了瘡疾，毋須請外國醫生破肚洗毒，只要在初患時每晨吞服　水少許，就可不藥而治。電信特栞天津東京間無綫電路成立感言  楨　　日昨張外長講演調整中日關係，希望今日雙方之具有遠大眼光與富有毅力之實際政治家，就大處遠處着想，各用最大之努力，榭立善意的諒解，尤須相互明暸其立塲與困難，經由正當途徑，開誠恊議。旨哉斯言，何其透澈若是！吾人業電，請以中日電信事業言之，則知惟有循上述辦法，能達到雙方圓備之目的也。　　我國往來日本電報，佔國際電報之半數，以前端賴水電傳遞，電路頗感不足。自二十三年六月開放上海東京間無綫電報電路，傳遞效率增加，報務驟形發達。本年二月，繼以上海東京間無綫電話開放，中日政府與人民，莫不稱便。是皆雙方電政當局，就大處遠處着想，基於平等互惠之精神，樹立善意的諒解，經由正當途徑，開誠恊議，故毅然有上述電路之成功。　　惟中日報務之由天津收發者不下於上海，在未有直達電路以前，所有日本各地與平律各地之電報，須由上海或青島或瀋陽接轉，速率未免减少。查依照二十三年中日報務合同，規定天律，青島，北平，等處開放中日直達無綫電路。除上海已於二十三年開放外，現經交部電政司與日本遞信省電務局代表在京磋商成立天津東京間直達無綫電路，自本日起，（六月一日）開放營業，規定尋常電每字收費九十生丁，新聞電二十八生丁，該常路依照上海東京間電路辦法，特准收發天律與日本往來之華文電報，及日文宇母電報。又自六月十五日起，北平與日本往來之中文電報，（以七個號碼組成一字），及日文字母電報，亦准由上述直達電路傳遞。　　觀於中日電信合作事項，吾入可知中日關係，並無不可調整之可能，且有早日設法調整之必要，祗須雙方負責之實際政治家，放大眼光，平心靜氣，相互明瞭其立塲與困難，經由正常途徑，恊議一切，以互利為目的，則何事不能成立？何難不能解除？豈僅電信事業而已耶？當茲中日問題正待恊商之時，中日電信局，恊議天津東京問無綫電路之成立，其振導東亞和祥之發端歟？記者不禁馨香以祝之。新訂國內交際電報規則之優點  仲賢　　附贈郵政儲金禮券　現成辭句之交際電　推廣交際電之範圍　　交通部為謀養成民衆樂用電報之習慣起見，曾經創辦國內交際電報一種按特定價目收費，一般稱便，惟以我國習俗，對於親友之婚喪餽贈，多尙財物，而交際電報，僅能表示精神上之慶弔，不能作物質上之餽儀。故近年來採用交際電報者雖多，而在電局業務方面，尙屬能十分普遍發達。交未部有鑒於斯，特將現行國內電報管業通則內關於交際電報一項之條文，予以修正，同時重訂國內交際電報規則一種。茲略述共內容之優點如下：　　　創辦交際電報附贈郵政儲金禮券辦法。交部為彌補交際電報偏靈精神忽於物質之點起見，特由電政司與郵政儲金局商定合作辦法，另訂交際電報規則，附有交際電報附贈禮券辦法一種。凡交際電報之發報人，得要求附贈郵政備金禮券一份，由投送該電之電局送交收報人。該項禮券之數額，自國幣一元起碼至二十元為止，不得帶有不滿一元之零數。禮券分為紅色及素色兩種，以便發報入任擇一種，作為贈送賀禮或奠儀之用。發報人如欲附贈禮券者，可向電局或其分收發處（例如南京鼓樓電報收發處，上海民國路電報收發處）索取「附贈禮券聲請單，依式塡明連同禮欵及手績費一角，繳付電局，由電局收報員掣給收據為憑。迨電到達對方電局後，卽由該電局依照發報人指定之禮券種類及欵額，備具郵政儲業禮券一份連同電報派差持送收報人。由收報人在禮券回執及電報回單上簽名蓋章後，仍交原差帶回電局，以憑查核。收報人收受此項禮券後，隨時可向郵局兌換國幣，或持向郵電兩局十足行使。例如購買郵票或抵付電報費電話費等，故收報人收受該項禮券，無異收受現金。　　上述交際電報附贈禮券辦法，尙有一種特別便利之處，卽吾人苟收到遠地親友寄來之喜柬或訃告後，如因為期促迫，不及購寄禮物或匯寄禮欵時，儘可採用該項交際電，祇需報費四角及手續費一角，所費無幾，而電報傳遞全國各處，無遠弗屆，無論為期如何迫近，均能隨發隨到，决無不及趕到之虞。惟上項辦法，在我國尙係創舉，故辦理該項業務之電局，暫指定南京·上海·鎭江·吳縣·銅山（卽徐州）·無鍚·杭州·鄞縣（卽寗波）·紹興·懷寗（卽安慶）·蕪湖·蚌埠·南昌·九江·漢口·武昌·宜昌·沙市·長沙·福州·厦門·成都·巴縣（卽重慶）·北平·天律·濟南·靑島·烟台·開對·鄭縣·陽曲（卽太原）·長安（卽西安）·貴陽等三十三局，自本年七月一日起先行試辦，俟將來發行禮券之郵局添加時，再由交通部隨時將添辦該項業務之電局名稱公告週知。　　　創辦現成辭句之交際電報　交際電報之辭句，須辭意兼美，又須兼顧電文字數，因文字上之組成不易，非一般民衆所能利用。交通部為便利民衆通信起見，特撰交際電報現成辭句，分為不附禮券者及附贈禮券者兩種，分類編號刋印於交際電報去報紙之背面（此項去報紙隨時可向當地電報局及其分收發處索取），以供發報人之選擇使用　　　推廣交際電報電文範圍　交際電報電文範圍，業經在國內電報營業通則內規定。惟社會人士對於親友遇險受驚，亦常有去電慰問，藉表關切誠意者，此次重訂國內交際電報規則時特將「遇險」一項加入，故其電文範圍，亦較前推廣矣。交通部最近電報局所及綫路之成立　　交通部二十五年四月份添設之電報局（包括報話營業處）曁修建完工之電報綫路如左：　　一、局所之添設　　局名　進行槪况　　商南局　商南為陝省東南重鎭，新設之商荆綫路，由此經過。爰成立電報局一所，以利通信。　　馬關局　馬關原有電報局，因綫毀暫停。茲綫路已通，特將局所恢復。　　上杭武平兩處　交通部前為聯絡閩贛通信，設立龍岩至會昌電報綫路。茲於綫路經過之上杭武平兩處，各成立報話營業處一所。　　平壩淸鎭兩處　平壩淸鎭，均在貴陽至安順電報綫路上。茲乘貴安修綫之便，將綫路引入城中，成立平壩淸鎭兩報話營業處　　二、綫路之修建　　事項　進行槪况　　商縣至荆紫關設綫　荆紫關位居豫鄂之交界，與陝之商縣，相距二百二十五公里。茲特派員架設電報桿綫，俾陝豫曁陝鄂省際通信，更多一捷徑，該綫於四月十九日完工。　　文山至馬關設綫　文山至馬關，計程八十一公里，原有電報桿綫，毀壞無餘。茲以該綫關係滇省邊疆通信，至為重要，爰派員重行架設桿綫，四月九日竣事。　　鄭縣至洛陽修綫　鄭洛間電報桿綫，每遇風雨，障礙叢生。　　茲准河南電政管理局大加修整，於四月十五日完成，計百四十九公里。電信珍聞巴黎鐵塔之電視　　巴黎鐵塔設置之電視臺，已於五月二十三日起，開始播送各種節目，舉凡跳舞歌曲滑稽，及各戲劇院歌舞藝員表演，凡有電視接收機者，安坐室中，均可當面視聽，不爽毫釐。按該項鐵塔，所用播送儀器，力量充足，天綫設在塔頂，與地面相距三百公尺，播送距離，可達六十公里云。羅馬汽車之電話　　羅馬市中心之汽車，在其駕駛座旁裝設一無綫電話機，機件極小，不占地位，而收音傳話器，全屬自動，尤為簡單。車中有此項設備，乘老隨時隨地，可以與家人或遠地親朋，甚至正在奔馳之車中入通話，不必離開汽車到路旁入家去借打雷話。此項新設備，實此車中裝設揚聲器收聽廣播節目又進步矣。關於廣播電台消息二則　　全國無綫電台轉播中央節目　　中央廣播事業管理處，以中央大電台播音射程，可達南洋及美澳各處，對於節目，孜孜改進，不遺餘力，除宣傳黨義政治之外，注重成人敎育·兒童敎育·並提倡高尙娛樂，與智德修養以期民衆不為低級樂所腐化，迎頭趕上，得與歐美電台並駕齊驅。最近復為齊一宣傳步驟起見，呈經中央執行委員會轉函行政院令行交通部及各省市政府，轉知民營及公營各廣播電台，除星期日外，每日於下午八時起，至九時零五分止，須一律轉播中央廣播電台節目。惟各地民營電台，設無轉播設備者，應於此時暫行停播，以杜紛歧，而收集中意志之效。　　籌劃擴充上海廣播電台　　交通部前擬在上海設立十啟羅瓦特大廣播電台一座。為訓練各部份人員起見，特先行成立五百瓦特廣播電台，開放播音。（卽現在之XQHC電台）惟大電台機件，嗣已移設成都，而QXHC電台，又以電力不大，收效未宏。查上海地方衝要，人口衆多，民營廣播電台，已有四十餘處，而播音節目，尙未能盡臻完善。為便於統制及整頓計，自需一節目良好之部力電台，以為模範。故交通部前有設立十啟羅瓦特大電台之進行，現在該項大電台，旣已移設，則XQHC電台之職務，自屬更為重要。爰决定將電力先行擴充至二千瓦特，並增加敎育文化節目，以期盡善。避免損壞海底電綫方法（續）  驊　　設有此種情事發生，應照左開各項分別適用之：　　泛物所　之錨，須由海底舉起約一丈左右為度，一面將浮泛之俾得脫離電綫。　　（丑）凡在淺繩拉緊，縛於船上，復將錨繩（或錨鍵）寬放下沉，水之中及靜海之中，又有一法，卽將錨由海底舉起一丈左右，一面將錨繩（或錨鍵）縛於船上，另將搭鈞放下藉以鈞約起電綫，此項搭鈎旣有堅固之繩縛於鈎叉，須用搭鈎鉤上電綫後，一面執搭鈎之繩縛於船上，之面仍將電綫鈎住於搭鈎間，乃將錨繩（或鍵）放，忽鬆，則錨自能舉起，再將縛於鈎叉之繩緊握手中，縛於船上，復將搭鈎之繩然放鬆，藉使搭鈎下沉，脫離電綫。（寅）或倘不能實行上述辦法，可將錨由海底舉起約一丈左右，一面使船向前緩行，直至錨繩（或鏈）掉向船尾，忽然放鬆，俾錨脫離電綫，倘或無效，再將錙由海底舉起約一丈左右，一面使船向後緩行，直至錨繩（或鏈）掉向船首，忽然放鬆。問答欄　　本刋特闢問答一欄，社會人士，對於電報電話收發手續及對於電信章程不明暸之處，或對於電信常識有所垂詢時，本刋表示歡迎，具情奉答。　　一、盛澤拱鳴韶君間目下江浙兩省電信建設，進步迅速，話綫密如蛛網，雖僻處鄉村，遠離都市，宛如晤言一室，民衆稱便。但各地電話公司及各零售處，均不將通話區通話費詳細載明，揭貼通衢，間或詢問接綫人某家通話否？或收費若干，豈料左右顧盼，瞠目無答矣。謂問解除此障礙，能於短期間見效否　　（答）關於各局長途通話地點及通話價目，以前均由各區電政管理局將該區所有通話地點及通話價目，彙總印一價目表分發各局，惟為數無多，日久不免散失，且檢閱不易。刻聞已由各電話營業處，自行將與該處互通地點及價目，列為分地價目表，粘貼營業處，俾用戶易於檢閱。並於可能範圍內，在各該地繁盛地點及交通要道，將此種表格粘貼矣。　　二、烟台局王元才君問儲匯局免費公電去報紙所列諸「括弧」，同人中有全行照拍者，亦有一槪不拍者，究覓孰是，祈指敎為荷。　　（答）儲匯局免費公電去報紙內所列括弧符號，均應照拍，以免錯誤。</p>

<p>讀書俱樂部一個中國的文法學家  張沛霖譯　　（譯者的話）『開明英文文法』（Kaiming　English　Grammar）一書，係林語堂先生所著，上冊於一九三〇年出版，下冊亦++於一九三二年出版；該書打破歷來舊式文法書之編制，一本『意念』之分類法爲主，然後求表達意念之方法，實爲文法界之大革命。數年來國內學術界未有箸文批評或介紹之者；今于日本英文學會主編之『英文學研究』季刊第十五卷第四期中，見東京帝國大學敎授市河之喜先生箸有“A　Chinese　Grammarina”一文，極力稱贊此書，並將其推薦于日本學生，茲特將該文迻譯如下：　　一九三一年巴黎法國大學開四百週紀念大會的時候，我代表東京帝國大學列席，出席代表中有一個中國人，名字呌林語堂，他是代表中央研究院的。我們在各種集會上相遇，然而沒有獲得交談的機會，等到後來我曉得了他是何等樣的人，我深悔當時沒有跟他談談。有一次開會，世界各方代表的四十位每人作一决幾分鐘的演說，其中唯有他的演說詞最現成，法文非常流利，而且講得很俊俏。　　這一年下半年我到哥本哈根去拜訪吉士勃孫博士（Dr．Jespersen，丹麥學者，當代文法學權威，共所著Philosophy　of　Grammar『文法理論』，Growth　and　Strueture　of　English　Grammar『英文法之發育及構造』，Modern　English　Grammar『現代英文法』，均極膾炙人口，其中允以Philosophy　of　Grammar一書爲劃時代的箸作。——譯者），談話之中他順便吿訴我，說不久以前有一個中國學者來訪問他，那人就是『開明英文文法』的箸者，他又拏出道書來給我看，說是極其有趣。這時候我才曉得我以前常常會面而未交一言的那位中國代表，却原來和我是同道。我回到日本來以後，吉士勃孫的Essentials　of　English　Grammar（『英文法精義』）出版了，在二一二頁上我看見有這麼一句，好像是從『開明英文文法』裏引來的，就是“English　commonsense　has　triumphed　over　grammatical　nonesnce”『英文的通見已經戰勝了文法的荒謬』）。　　于是我越發想買這本書來看看，最近才承上海一位朋友之情給我買了來。並且聽說林博士和那個箸『阿Q正傳』的名作家魯迅，他們倆是一夥的人，他最近寫了一本My　Country　and　My　People（『我的國家與我的人民』），據說這是中國人寫本國情形寫得最好的一本害。　　以上關于箸者已經說了不少。現在來談談他的『開明英文文法』吧。這本書的確是値得注意的，它的解釋英文文法，不像舊式文法課本那樣定下許多界說規則，而是依照意念或意象把表現法的一切文法工具分門別類，然後硏究怎樣用英文把這些意念表達出來。箸者所受吉士勃孫的『文法理論』書之惠，在全書中都可看得出，然而他的論述方法却是別出心裁，他的英文也使人百讀不厭，不落普通文法書的窠臼。就這門學科的性質而論，這是一個很大的特點。箸者在講意念文法的時候，把中英文表現法的異似之點拿來比較，比較得非常恰當。這本來應該如此，而且對於一般想求得切實使用英語的能力的中國學生，一定是極有裨益的。這本書原來是作爲高中敎本或自修之用，但是我們高級學校（即日本的大學預科——譯者）的敎師和學生們，如需要一本在普通學校敎本以上的高級英文文法的話，我敢把它極力推薦給他們。中文部份我們也大半可懂，並且可以增加我們的興趣。　　茲以篇幅關係，道里不便逐章討論，但如『表現法的科學』（Science　of　Expression），『代表法』（Modification），『規定法』（Determination），『修飾法』（Modification），『動作的一方面』（A　ects　of　Action），『事實和空想』（Fakts　and　Fancy），『關聯』（Relationships），『表現法的經濟』（Economy　of　Expression）這些章目，便足以表明這本書與普通文法的編制不同了。的確每一章，每一頁都提供一些有趣的東西，能使讀者心　神怡。正因爲它是以科學的和心理學的原則爲根據，所以絲毫沒有學究氣，而用以說明現代的習慣法的例子和練習，都非常豐富。下面引一段箸者的英文以見一斑：　　“The　power　of　expression　can　be　trained　only　by　learning　expressive，everchanging　idioms，and　not　by　putting　on　the　grammatical　straitjacket。Grammaras　the　science　of　expression　should　be　more　subtle　and　less　rigid;it　should　addressitself　more　to　the　speaker's　intentions　and　less　to　the　rules　and　delinitions。It　should　be　more　concrete　and　wallow　less　in　the　terms　of　Latin　origin。It　should　also　be　more　positive　and　less　less　like　a　criminal　code。”　　『只有學習那些善能表意而變化無定的成語，才能養成表現的力量，决不是把文法的筆挺的短衣穿上了就成功的。文法旣是表現法的科學，就應該是詭譎萬端而不是牢不可破的；它應和發言者的意志多通聲氣、少和規則及界說來往。文法應該是具體的，不應專在拉丁字源的辭語當中打滾。它也應該是積極的，不應該像刑法條文一般。』　　這本書自始至終是以這種語調來寫的，我回想到箸者在巴黎旣有那樣的演說詞，無怪乎擺在我們面前的這本書是這樣富于提示的材料了。總之我認爲這本書是中國學術界對于英文研究的一個很好的貢獻，也應該受日本英語學者的歡迎。在日本，英文文法書不是學者氣味太重，便是太嫌陳腐爛調：一個使人如敬鬼神而遠之，一個使人棄如敝屣。然而林博士的書合乎中庸之道。我國學生中要養成英文的思想法並以英文表達意念的能力而不顧文法規則作怪的，人數已日見增多了，所以道本書應該鄭重推薦給他們閱讀閱讀。「昆蟲漫話」作者的自白  陶秉珍　　年來爲了所習學科關係，頗買幾本昆虫書看看。這些書除給我應用的知識外，還帶來了一份額外贈品；就是常使我作兒時的回憶。　　在保持着幾分原始人習性的兒童時代，因接近自然的機會比較多，常遇到種種連父兄都無法回答的奇象。這些疑惑，深深地沉沒在腦海中，經過了十年，二十年，三十年而偶然在道些書本中，獲得正確合理的解釋時，不但要呌一聲『原來如此』，而兒時情景，也歷歷複現在眼前，心中更生一種『翻過萬重谿山，回頭一望』的快感。想把這種快感，像投石水中時所起的漣漪般，漸次傅達開去的一點願望，便是促我忙裹偷閒地寫成這本小小著作的原動力　　書中所講到的昆虫，都是日常容易看到的；一共十四種，按了時令排着：最先是萬花齊放時出來的蜂，蜜蜂，蝶；接着是在『長日似年』的夏天，特地來安慰或打攪人們的蟬，螢，蚊，蠅；此後，是階前低唱，草上橫行的秋蟲，蜻蛉，蟋蟀，蝗蟲，螳螂，天牛；至於北風凛冽的冬天，昆蟲多已死亡或蟄伏，找不到應時的種類；因此，把差不多終年活動的蚤和蟻附在末了。　　旣是習見的種類，那末它們的形狀和習性，當然一般人多已知道；普通書本上也有記載；所以木書中就幾樁奇妙的性狀，作詳細的叙述爲主。　　科學原是屬於知的東西，作靜態的記述，容易成功；但本書爲了要增加讀者們的興趣起見，儘可能地多用動態的叙事法。例如六十二頁上記蠡斯捕蟬的情形：　　『……蟬，耐着炎熱，奏了整天的交響樂，一到夜裏，總想休息一下；可是，在這休息時間中，還要屢决受別入的打攪。有時從茂密的樹蔭中，漏出短促而尖銳的悲啼，這就是說明牠已遇到夜間熱心地打獵的螽斯的襲擊了。螽斯撲住了蟬之後，先向牠的腹側，開一個洞，把肚子裏的東西拉出來。把各種樂器飽吃一頓之後，再將這歌手殺死。……』　　『爾雅讀不熱，蟚認作蟹』，在分類學方面少用功的人，往往要鬧出『張冠李戴』的笑話。本書因是一般讀物，所以祇將重要的幾種講一講。例如蟋蟀這項中，將蟋蟀，油葫蘆，三角蟋蟀，高顴蟋蟀，意大利蟋蟀等的特徵，遂一說明。同時，對於異名也相當注意。例如百十七頁上有下面這樣一節：　　『蟋蟀不單有許多異種，就是普通蟋蟀，也因方言關係，又有許多異名：像蛩，是牠早早已經有了的異名；又因爲牠要低吟淺唱，就呌做吟蛩。牠在深秋呌得最起勁，彷彿在催人們，趕快織布，準備寒衣；因此又呌做促織和趨織。俗諺說：『促織嗚，懶婦驚。』於是山東濟南就呌他懶婦（見古今注），漢朝龍驤子，自己的名呌邛，不願說同音的蛩，就呌作秋風；這是因個人方便而替牠加上的異名（見淸異錄）。此外還有王孫（見陸璣詩疏）投機（見埤雅）莎亭部落（見淸異錄）等特別的名字。』　　記叙昆蠢性狀的文藝作品，也擇允引用。例如八十六頁上，從滑稽大王東方朔傅中，引用一節：　　『郭舍人曰：『客從東方來，歌謠且行。不從門入，踰我牆垣，遊戲中庭。一人殿堂，擊之桓桓，死者攘攘，格鬥而死，主人被創。是何物也？』朔曰：『長喙細身，畫亡夜存，嗜肉惡燈，爲掌指所捫。臣朔愚懸，名之曰蚊。『舍人辭窮，常復脫褌。』——東方朔傳。　　一百八十二頁上，更引用梅特靈克描寫蟻類空中結婚的美文如下：　　『她必定向沒有小鳥打攪的地方飛翔。她再向高飛，於是，從下面追上來的雜羣，稀薄了，零落了。弱者，殘廢者，老者，發育不完全者，營養不良者等等，絕望了，在空中消失了，在雲霞般無限數中剩下來的，祇精力絕倫的小羣。她再奮最後的餘力，看吧！以不可思議的力而當選的，追着她，捉住她，征服她了。他們用二重翅力支持着，抱合了向上飛翔，在相對的戀的在熱中，盤旋亂舞。』　　本書寫作的動機和內容梗要，大致如此。假如對於靑年讀者不會有多少貢獻的話，那眞是袍憾的事了。一部可讀的書  陳汝惠　　我時當聽人家說：『國難這樣嚴重，不應，該再唸文學的讀本，這太無聊，會把自己的志氣虛糜掉』。　　我們來估量這話的時候，就不免有了疑問：文學訊本果然無聊嗎？國難嚴重時期，文學會失去她獨在的價値嗎？　　我們可以諒解說這話的那個人，因爲也許他所接觸的文學讀本，正是够得上「無聊」。般『流行作家』，誠然善於搬弄風，花，雪，月，和浪漫的愛情題材，這種作品印在靑年腦裹，刺激的力量，或者不會缺乏，可是因了這種刺激，要發生些什麽反應，就値得玫慮一下了。於是難免有人會說文學的閒話。　　如果所有的文學作品，只是一種桃色的麻醉藥膏，或者是消磨年靑人志氣的軟皮糖，那麽儘可以乾脆地把牠開除出文化界，何况現在是『國難這樣嚴重』的時期。　　但是這種推論，却不能成立；因爲在文學的園地裏，决不盡是些迷醉靈魂的花卉，有許多作品，是有極高的價値，非但不見得『無聊』，不至於『虛糜靑年志氣』，並且正合在國難當兒去讀讀的。——當我們目睹家國危急，何所適從的時候，讀了這些作品，也許會使你决定走上一條新的途徑。　　大家總讀過都德『最後的一課』吧，那個阿爾薩司的童子，那個法文老敎師漢麥爾先生，從都德的筆尖一一溜到我們的腦裏？就刻下一個畢生難忘的印象，一種愛國的熱情，受了最後的一課的鼓動，不禁油然而生。靑　的讀者，總十分渴望能够再讀讀類似這樣的好文章，甚而至於把最後的一課無厭地重複的唸着；不，簡直是一字一句的咀嚼又咀嚼。　　一種熱烈的需要，大家都有一些經騐；也正爲着這緣故，我就不能不把『俘虜』來介紹給親愛的讀者。　　一八七〇年普法之戰，法國是失敗了；當時整個法國人民的憤慨和哀痛，都壓在普魯士軍隊的鐵蹄之下，但是在自然主義的幾位大師——都德左拉莫泊桑筆下，終於全盤流露了出來。最後的一課僅是其中的一篇，而俘虜却包括這三位大師的關於普法之戰的作品底全部菁華。　　誰也知道：短篇小說到了都德，左拉，莫泊桑等手裏，已達到爐火純靑的地步；他們所留下的作品，全世界文人都公認是：文學遺產中最可寳貴的一部。每一篇小說，文筆的流俐，描寫的生動，結構的技巧，呌人不能不心服。而譯俘虜的李先生叉是最熟悉法國文學的作家，允其在介紹莫泊桑左拉等作品方面。有這樣的作者，有這樣的譯手，俘虜的確是不平凡的讀本了。　　爲了讓讀者更明瞭俘虜的內容起見，我再來簡略的介紹一下：　　俘虜搜集都德的作品，有最後的一課等七篇。都德是法國人民極信仰的作家，法國中小學校的敎科害中，幾乎每一本都選着他的作品；因爲他寫的東西，實在好也實在有價値。　　作者在『小奸細』一篇中，寫主角小斯代英因爲做了奸細，那種見神見鬼的虛心病，所反映出來的心理一的鬥爭，眞是刻劃入微。　　　　在『不爭氣的兒子』中，作者叙述一個做鐵匠的老父親，爲了兒子逃避兵役，而甘願遠赴菲洲去償還他兒子所欠的役兵義務，寫得非常深刻：　　『孩子！這裏是幾砧，這裏是用的傢伙，……這一切現在都歸你管。……你旣然爲這一切犧牲你的榮譽，那末你得的這一些東西，是很少又很少的，……你現在是這裏的主人，我呢，我就走，……你對於法國欠下五年光陰的義務，我現在去替你還」。　　在『掌旗官』一篇中，寫一個愛團旗勝過自己生命的掌旗小軍官：　　『他醉了，他痴了，撲到那個普國軍官身邊，把他最心愛的那面旗子奪過來，緊緊握住；隨後他又竭力把牠舉起來，很高，很直。一面喊着『敎旗！……』不過這時候，他的聲音在他的喉嚨裏停住了。在道種鬆懈的空氣裏，在道種那樣沈重地壓在各處投降的城市上面的死空氣裏，種種旗子都不能招展了，無論甚麽帶着發揚蹈厲的意味的，都不能生活了。……末了，道個老邁的霍洛思，終於陡然直挺挺地倒下來。』　　俘虜中關於莫泊桑的作品，搜集了五篇，莫氏是寫短篇小說的怪傑，一直到現在，還找不出和他可以匹敵的作家。在一塲决鬥中，他寫一個不甘受普軍軍官侮辱的法國人，和那侮辱他的普軍官决鬥。文筆儘管簡潔，情緒却非凡地緊張，呌人讀了像親眼目睹的一樣。　　在俘虜一篇裏，作者又狡猾地挖苦法國民軍的懦弱無用，爲了要使已經關在地窰裹的七個德國兵投降，一百多個法國軍人，竟不得不用水管向地窑裏灌了三小時的水，道樣一支勇敢的軍隊，不久果然受了政府的褒獎與助章。全篇用表現心理的手腕神妙地寫出，使人感到好笑，但是也感到了作者內心的沉痛。　　莫氏在『哼哼小姐』中，描寫德國軍官怎樣殘忍地任意破壞法國人民的財產：　　『那第一個闖入者哼哼小姐，（某德軍官別號）在一個剛被炸去頭顱的維納司女神的磁像跟前，拍手在笑。他們每人拾起些碎的磁片，對於這些碎片的奇異齒狀，很爲詫異，於是審査這些新的破壞，討論某一些損害，是前一次爆裂的力量所釀成的。而那中校，郤用一緻家長式的慈愛態度，賞識這座被這『奈龍』式的炸彈攪翻，又舖滿了美術品的殘骸的八客廳。……』　　左拉是法國自然主義的鼻祖，讀過法國小說的人，便會熟悉他的名字。他與莫泊桑，福羅倍爾都是齊名的一代文豪。俘虜中搜集他的小說，只有水磨之戰一篇，但是相常的長。在本書十三篇之中，道一篇的結構最複雜，並且描寫也最細膩。叙述一個不屬法國籍的少年，爲了情人——法國姑娘的緣故，而參加了『水磨之戰』。結果被德軍捕殺在他的情人之前。作者寫到主角被殺的情境，眞可以呌人凄咽。　　『一排怕人的槍聲，像迅雷似地在她耳邊爆發了；這一下呌她立刻轉過來看。原來那軍官剛才喃喃地說道：『我們先來算淸這件事吧。』於是親自把陶敏毅推到一座廠屋的牆邊，隨即就發了開槍的命令。等到佛蘭素絲轉過身來，陶敏毅已經倒在地下了。——他當胸中了十二粒槍子。　　她沒有哭，她在那裏發呆，兩隻眼睛成了直視的。後來才走到那廠屋下面，在那個和陶敏毅屍首相距幾步的地方坐下來，她向他端詳；有時候，她的手半意識地動一下。』　　總之，俘虜從頭到尾，沒有一篇不精采，不緊張，也許正是作者用血和淚寫成的呢。三位文學上的大天才，眼看祖國爲敵人所蹂躪，將滿腔悲憤，融化在字裏行間，有這樣來歷的作品，當然不是尋常人在平凡的情景中，向壁寫下的東西所可比擬的。　　我們讀到道些可歌可泣的小說，可以想像到當時法國人民，並非是只會『鎭靜』的民族。正如譯者所說：『在普法之戰以後四十多年，仍能彀勝利地收回以前的失地，决不是什麽偶然的事。』　　我們固然沒有什麼×京之圍，但是情形也不比『巴黎之圍』時代的法國好；所以靑年們應該讀些敵愾小說，是當然的事了。　　俘虜是文學作品，然而是敵愾小說。她可以助長我們的愛國熱情，可以鼓勵我們勇敢地踏上民族鬥爭的火線。</p>

<p>經濟專刊農本局之展望  黃通　　一　　農業恐慌，年來殆成爲世界普遍的現象。我國農村，內有封建殘餘的剝削，外受國際資本的侵奪，其崩潰之急劇，廣汎與深刻，更非想像所可幾及！　　國人之談農村救濟者，各以觀點不同，主張互異。有主「改良農業生產技術」者，有主「調整農産運銷一者，有主「流通農村金融」者，更有主普及鄕村敎育，推進鄉村自治」者，總之：不外要在現存社會體系之下，利用公共的，公益的，五助的或其他組織之力，爲奄奄一息的農村，投下一劑讀命湯」而已。　　這次，實業部籌設農本局，擬聯合政府及銀行界，對於農村，爲有計劃有系統的投資，以合作組織爲骨幹，辦理「流通農業資金，調整農業產品一兩大業務。從此，將過　枝節散漫的救濟工作，納入統一整合之途，刦餘農村，或有　蘇之望歟！　　二　　農本局優點殊多，舉其大者，約有三端。　　　我國農民經濟，凋敝已極，據中央農業實騐所估計，全國半數以上的農民，都負有值務。（一）各省農家總數，如以五八，五六九，一八一戶估計，（二）則負責農家，當在二千九百餘萬戶以上。每家究負債多少，雖無統計可考，但設以八十元，作爲每家負債的總數，（三）則二千九百餘萬戶農家所負債務，合計當在二十三萬元以上。然此僅就農家所已負之債務而言；査全國所有耕地，的有十二萬萬餘畝，（四）每畝如貸以經營資金五元，便需六十萬萬餘元，這豈非一可驚的數目！我國現有所謂農業和農工銀行，雖不下二十餘家，但已繳資本總額，不過二千餘萬元；（五）今年春，財政部特准中　農民銀行，發行鈔票一萬萬元，規定以其半數，爲土地振押放欺及農村放欵之用；再益以商業銀行之農村貸欵，至多亦不過一萬萬元左右；以之應付八十三萬萬餘元（淸理舊債和經營資金合計）之需要，眞不啻「滄海一粟」呢！　　今農本局資金定爲六千萬元，半爲固定資金，由政府籌給，半爲合放資金，由參另銀行合繳，此外，猶有無定額的流通資金，由農本局於每年度開始，或隨時與參加銀行洽定　給一之。全國銀行資金總額究有若干，暫不必論，茲以上海二十八家較有資望的會員銀行而言，一九三三年度的存欵總額，即在二十四萬萬兀以上，各種放欵，計有二十萬萬二千餘萬元之多，（六）前去兩年度情形，較此當更有增進，那末，流通資金之有豐澤的泉源，可想而知。何况除上項資余外，必要時；政府猶得令農本局發行農　社債，由政府任據保本息之責，其資力之雄厚，斷非現有所謂農業和農工銀行所可望其肩背；此其優點一。　　　我國「農産品賤，農用品貴」，殆成正常趨勢，農村與都市間之收支，因之恒失平衡；益以年來政治未上軌道，鄕村缺乏自衛力量，較爲富裕的居民，相率席　所有，移住都市，以致「資金偏在」之弊，愈形深刻。都市苦於餘資無處消納，而農村則一貧如洗，過猶不及，　兩敗俱傷！過去　有商資流入農村之舉，但零星散碎，爲額不多；重以無統制無計劃的結果，「擇肥而噬」，互相爭利，卒至以地論，需要越急者，越無人投資，以人論，生計愈困者，愈無人過問！今由政府出爲通盤規劃，使全國銀行，在農本局統率之下，作一集團化的農村放欵，並由政府保本保息，策其安全，從此，屯積於都市的剩餘資金，得源源流人農村，兩者將交受其益：此其優點二。　　　我國民食，向堪自給，民國初兀，尙有　糧出口，供給鄰邦，乃自近年以來，漸感不足，每年輸人米麥甚鉅，據海　報吿，去年度食糧進口，達一萬九千五百九十一萬餘元之多，佔入超總額十分之四，實堪驚駭！考其癥結所在，决非盡由於生寡食衆」，否則民國二十一，二十二兩年，各省均吿豐收，何以米麥仍有進口，可見農產物市場糾織缺陷，產銷不能調劑，實爲一重大原因。今農本局內置農產部，從事一般農產品買賣，以懋遷有無，廣設農　倉庫，以調劑盈虛，並參與農産品運率及稅率之釐訂，以减輕「販賣費（Cost　of　Marketing），則於國家民食政策上，必有重大貢獻：此其優點三。　　三　　農本局之優點，略如上述；但細檢其內容，亦不無缺點可尋，茲分別舉之於後。　　　農本局缺點之一，在於體系不定。國家對於金融事業，應有整個體系，門分類別，各盡所能，方收筋絡貫通，血流疏暢』之效。我國現有銀行，合計一百九十餘家，而經營普通　務者，即達一百八十餘家，性質不分，業務日狹，且以正當營業不振之故，多利用高利率吸收存欵，以充標金，外滙，地產，債券，貨物投機運用之資金，市場上隨時發生擾亂現象。財政部自實行新貨幣政策後，更謀改善整個金融制度，擬將現有銀行，就其經營範圍，加以縮小集中，確立其性質，別爲中央，實業，農業。商業，不動產抵押，儲蓄，滙兌，工業等八類銀行。　　　我國現有所謂農業和農工銀行，已逾廿餘家，不但資力薄弱，而且名不符實。「有的只在努力於鈔票發行。，有的轉變爲商　銀行。競以投機爲務；有的會經經營不正當的業務；有的祗是某一省的省銀行，或某一市的市銀行；興農無緣，與工無涉』。（八）求其能稍盡農行之職責者，似僅江蘇省農民銀行一家而已。　　這種有名無實的農業金融機關，自非加以整理不可。査中國農民銀行，白從叫省農行改組後，實收資本已有七百萬元，所辦農村放欵，亦達一千萬元，近由財部特准發鈔一萬萬　，以五千萬兀辦理農村放欵，資力漸臻雄厚，總分支行，行將普及全國，已成立者，達五十三處，其餘正在積極添設中。　　今按農本局性質，係公私協作之組合，與中國農行之爲官商合辦，頗相近似；其業務內容，亦與中國農行之營業，大同小異。倘事實上可能的話，不如一面移設農本局之資金，爲擴充中國農行之用，使其改成一健全有力的專營中期或動產信用之機關，一面再於中國農行之外，籌設中央合作銀行及中央土地銀行，以應付短期及長期信用，而以財實兩部，爲調巷及主管機構。似此，旣可不使同一性質的金融機關，競相設立，以致减弱力量而增重開支，又可使農業金融，得有整合統一的體系，詎非一舉數得？當然，以農本局爲純粹的中期或動產信用機關，而將中國農行，改爲經營長期的抵押信用機關，祇要事實上便利，亦無所不可　　　農本局缺點之二，在於祖織不明。據農本局大綱所載，其本身尙含許多矛盾。例如：一、農本局設立之使命，在於「流通農業資本，調整農業產品」，前者主係金融事業，而後者則近於行政設施，二者宜合作而不宜兼營。今併爲一體，無異以金融機關而兼辦農業行政，未免有職權混淆之嫌。　二、農本局資金，分固定、合放、流通三種，固定資金，似即官股，合放資金，類於商股，流通資金，則爲一種銀行放欵：按其性質，顯係公私協作之組合。但農本局之目的何在，公益乎，抑營利乎？如以公益爲目的，則商業銀行非慈善機關，政府旣以保本保息等優厚條件，熱望其參加投資，則勢之所趨，難免不以「增加利潤」，爲其最後歸宿。如以營利爲目的，則與一般商業銀行之農村貸欵，將何所擇，欲求達到「發展農業，扶助農民」之宗旨，戞戞乎難矣！　　　晨本局缺點之三，在於貸欵成本太高。農本局放欵資源，有固定、合放、流通三種，固定資金，由政府籌撥，合放和流通資金，則由銀行界供給。普通銀行之本質，在於「將本求利」，自然希望其所投資金之安全，與利息之優厚。今農本局對於銀行合放資金，規定週息八厘，貸給農民，自須稍高。此八厘之週息，在銀行界方面，　　放欵成本，或尙有虧折之慮，而在農民方面，　之農業收益，則已苦實惠無多。中央農業實騐所調査各省市合作社向外借欵困難情形，有手續麻煩者佔百分之一四，保證困難者佔百分之二，交通不便者佔白分之一〇，而利息太高者佔百分之七　：以此證彼，可見一斑。倘農木局偶一不愼，偏於爲銀行界謀利益，則所謂「農業放欵」，勢將僅使都市的銀行資本，轉變爲農村的高利貨資本，所謂「農業運銷」，　將益使農業生產，增强其商品化，結果，爲都市金融，另拓投資的尾間而已，救濟農村云乎哉！　　四　　綜上所述，農本局雖不無包藏若干缺點，但衡以我國今日金融界及農村的實際情形，自屬「聊勝於無」，吾人固不欲吹毛求疵而願樂觀厥成也。然吾人已言之，農村崩潰之根人，在於外受國際資本之侵奪，內有封建殘餘之剝削。故對外，要集合整個民族的力量，解除帝國主義的覊絆，對內，要用緊强的手段，改革不合理的農村生産關係，夫然後，奄奄垂斃的農村，纔有眞正同生的希望！　　土地爲農業生產之基本要素，欲謀農村生產關係之改革，首應解决土地問題，這是任何人不會加以吾認的。土地問題之解决有賴土地金融機關之輔助，故中國地政學會第二届年會，即决議以實行設立土地余融機關，爲目前土地政策一大綱領。去年十一月，財部宜布新幣制，附帶提及舉辦不動產抵押放欵。嗣後在五全大會時，父通過發展土地經濟和信用一案，訓令財內兩部核辦。而籌設土地銀行之議，亦已屢見報端，惜乎「密雲不雨」，吾人所昕夕薪求的土地銀行，未知何日纔得實現？至於籌設中之不動產抵押銀行，似將以都市地產爲其營業對象；中國農民銀行，雖奉令辦理土地抵押放欵，但父非專營土地信用之機關，與吾人所謂土地銀行，固未可同日而語也。　　我國今日各銀行所辦農村放欵，大抵短期性質，在農民僅受暫時之資金上流通，仍無以消除其實際的痛苦。農本局之任務，亦無非就已成之規模，加以進一步的調整而已，與農村危機之積極的挽救，距離尙遠。吾人深望賢明的當局，於籌設農本局以外，對於整個的農業金融制度，再作精到的規劃，庶幾可爲破碎的農村，爭取光明的前途！　　　見農情報吿第二卷第叫期　　　見統計月報農業專號二十一年一二月合刋　　　參照吳承禧先生著「中國銀行業的農業金融」社會科學雜誌第六卷第三期第五〇九面　　　據張心一先生估計　　　參照吳著中國銀行業的農業金融第四六八面　　　同上第四六九——四五〇面　　　參照「財部整理銀行制度」載二五年三月二九日益世報　　　見吳著中國銀行業的農業金融第四六八面　　　參照『中中交三行意見書』二五年五月一六日申報　　　見農情報吿第三卷第二期設立農本局現應注意之要點  啟華　　中國今日之危機，全在農村經濟之破產，以致民生凋敝，百業不振，而國祚亦因之岌岌危殆。故復興農村已成我國目前唯一之政治經濟問題。我國政府蒿目時艱，惄焉憂之，爰先後設立全國經濟委員會，復興農村委員會等機關，以期挽救此已就崩潰之國民經濟，而自去年十月十日，蔣中正院長發表「國民經濟建設之意義及實施」一文後，舉國上下更一致注意於國民經濟之建設。是誠復興民族，繁榮農村之蓬勃氣象也。　　最近政府爲流通農業資金，調整農業產品，藉以發展農村起見，特由實業部聯合各銀行設立農本局，其辦法大綱業經吳鼎昌部長邀集金融界共同擬定，而其詳細辦法亦正在草擬之中。惟辦法人綱雖博訪周諮，但揆其內容不無可以斟酌之處。茲就管見所及，乘此廣徵意見之時，略論設立農本局應注意之要點，以供國人之研討。　　一·農本局之組織應以合作制度爲基礎　今茲農業部擬行組織之農本局，無論其將爲中央農業金融統一之統制機構與吾，應以合作制度爲組織之基礎。我國今日農村經濟崩潰之原因，固非一端，而農民本身缺乏强有力之組織，實爲最重要之原因。因農民無完善之組織，故勢力渙散，一切經濟建設皆無從着手，農民惟有坐受高利貸之盤剝，及居間人之壟斷。農業合作爲近世一種最有效之經濟組織，在歐美各國L有　著之成續，故蔣院長發衣之國民經濟建設之意義及其實施一文，亦曾言振興農業生產，悉以合作社爲基礎。據辦法大綱之規定，農本局似屬一種官商合辦之企業，但農本局貸欵之對象爲各縣及各農村之農業銀行或合作社或農民典當，且於必要時，政府得令農本局發行農業社債，則又似頗含合作之性質。無論大綱之規定爲何，農本局之組織應以合作制度爲基礎，質言之，即採用美國農業信用行政局（Farm　Credi　Administration）辦理之原則。美國隸屬於農業信用行玫局之一切永久貸欵機關，除聯邦中期信用銀行外，皆以合作制度爲基礎。凡農民向聯邦土地銀行或生產信用合作社借欵，其對於貸欵機關之投票股額，至少應等於其借欵數額百分之五。同樣，凡合作社向合作社銀行每借欵二千元。或不滿二千元，應認購銀行股份一百元。因此借欵人分攤貸欵機關之統治權及所有權，並均沾其所獲之收益，以期於最後借欺農民獲得全部所有權。竊謂我國農本局即宜倣倣此種合作制度耳。　　二·農本局應有之紕織系統　農本局應依照健全之企業實施，以適應農民需要而利率最低之貨欵，經由其農資部及農產部，貸與農民之組織。農資部設若干區域信用銀行，共營長期，中期，短期三種放欵，惟在創辦之始，以經營短期爲主，漸决及於中期長期，農民經由地方合作社（信用合作社，購買合作社，利用合作社等類），向區域信用銀行借欵，而提供相當之擔保，如不動產與動産抵押及個人信用等。農資部設若干區域生產信用公司，專營生產及運銷貸欵，並得供給合作倉庫之資金，及謀運銷職務（Marketing　Function）上之一切利便，但不得代理一般農産品買賣事務。生產信用公司之生要職務，應爲組織與監督生產信用合作社，及供給生產信用合作社之資金。農民經由地方合作社（生產信用合作社，運銷合作社等類），向區域生產信用公司借欵，而提供相當之擔保，如動產抵押或作物留置權，棧單，及裝運憑證等。農資部與農產部應分別經營，不宜兼營，俾免牽累之弊。茲繪述農本局之組織系統如：　　三·農本局資金之來源　農本局之資金即依大綱規定由政府撥給三千萬兀，分五年撥足，無須銀行之合放資金及所謂流通資金。如遇需要時，農本局得經理事會呈准實業部發行免稅農業社債，任由銀行，私人投資者購買，政府任擔保本息之責。例如美國聯邦農業抵押公司（Federal　Farm　Morlgage　Corporation）發行之債券亦山政府擔保本息，故購買者極爲踴躍。我國農本局將來發行農業社債，除以局中之資産爲擔保外，復得政府之担保，投資者自可高枕無憂，而農本局之資金亦不致有竭蹶之慮，惟農業社債之發行額應有限制，例如美國聯邦中期信用銀行發行之債券總額，不得超過其餘股本及盈之十倍。農本局發行債券，由銀行及私人投資，給以法定利率，故農本局每年度决算有盈餘時，不再酬給投資者，而應分配與地方合作社社員，以爲合作紅利，尤宜提布公積金，俾增厚農本局之經濟力量，得以從而降低農民借欵之利率。　　農本局旣非官商合辦之性質，故投資銀行無須推舉理事，參與農本局之理事會。此理事會可由十一人組織之。實業部部長爲當然理事，農資部與農產部之地方合作社各推舉叫人，其餘二人由實業部部長就投資銀行及私人投資者中遴選，以代表投資者之利益。　　四·農本局創辦時應有之注意　農本局創辦時應有下列數項加以注意，否則，不免趨於失敗之途徑：　　　人才之遴選。凡農本局之辦事人員均須有相當之農業金融，合作，商業等專門知識，更須對於上項知識有相當之經騐。若不選用專門人才，則農本局必失敗無疑。　　　區域之選擇：農木局設有區域信用銀行與區域生產信用公司。美國區域信用銀行及區域生產信用公司設於相同之城市，我國似可不必。農本局可視各地之情形，而分設信用銀行區或生產信用公司區，同一區域亦不必兼設信用銀行及生產信用公司。且在創辦之始，所設之區域以少爲要，俟辦理有相當成績時，漸謀擴充，未爲晚也。　　　預算之重要：無論何事，必先預算；若無預算，結果必遭失敗。農本局應預算其營業收益（由農民收入之利息等）是吾能支付營業費用（債券或借欵利息，職員薪資等）。如果營業費用浩大，非營業收益所能勝任，則事業必遭失敗，不若不創辦之爲愈也。　　上述四點，乃當今設立農本局所應注意之犖犖大者，蓋惟如此實行之，始能收成功之效也。啓事　　莫湮。予　。孔鈞。卜愈之。吳小甫。諸君鑒、五月份承蒙惠稿、薄具酬資、賬已結算、除將酬金單寄奉外、請自本月六月起至十日止、每日下午二時至四時、憑本部寄上之酬金單、向本館會計處領取爲荷、經濟專刊編輯部啟商業新聞金融　金交公單開始交割　　今日有三九七六條收解總數尙剩七四二條未消　　金交六月份公單、今日已屆現金交割之期、空方昨已解所三千九百七十六條、占全部總數百分之八十四强、尙剩七百四十二條未淸、今將收解細數及剩餘條額錄後、　　空方昨已解所者、大昌祥二千八百零七條、元茂永二百七十七、大豐恒一百九十六、元昌永一百八十九條、盈豐恒一百零五條、大恒九十一條、元一七十條、丙興四十九條、萬興四十二條、申豐永豐潤昌裕各三十五條、裕新祥二十八條、惠祥十四條、永德七條、多方今日應收者、計益成一千三百二十三條、同豐恒七百二十一　條、順茂六百六十五條、洽豐永四百六十九條、福泰亨二百七十三條、大德成二百十七條、生源永一百七十五條、恒餘迎祥慶發永各三十五條、大順十四條、鼎康福興永各七條、共計三千九百七十六條、結價一一三五元、　　本月份之尙未交割或掉期者、除公單計多方益成二百三十八條、司豐恒一百三十三條、順茂一百十九條、接豐永九十一條、福泰亨大德成各四十九條、生源永三十五條、恒餘迎祥慶發永大順各七條、空方計春源永三百二十九條、元茂永三百十五條、盈豐恒九十八條、總數尙剩七百四十二條、共計多方十一家、空方三家、　　七月期陣容、多方計同泰昌一千有零、大恒萬興各八百以上、順利迎祥各六百餘、惠祥裕康餘慶永五昌祥各五百以上、元一元茂永各四百餘、恒昌永洽豐永祥豐福餘各三百以上、慶發永一百有零、福泰永義生永亨大發永潤昌永匯源宏利成豐永恒餘同福祥和各一百以上空方計同豐恒一千八百餘、大昌祥一千三百餘、景福千一百餘、乾昌祥福泰亨各九百餘、生源永七百餘、福興永六百餘、春源永大德成各五百以上、大豐恒叫百弱、裕新祥元亨福大益成盈豐恒各二百餘、大順潤昌裕元昌永養餘利豐各一百以上、總數計一萬一千三百六十條、共計多頭五十家、空頭三十家、週末標金初堅後疲　　外匯中央塞華商扒：近平遠緊　　前日（五月三十日）金市初堅後疲、良以謠傳激動寳氣、惟不久、即因多方源源了結、結果反跌、晨初塲外預備交易開出爲三十九元光景、蓋因倫敦生金下降、標準金價降爲一一三二元七角也、惟大戶惠祥順利鼎康均進、晨開漲至一一四一元、惠祥元茂永鼎康慶發永福興永俱購、曾升爲四十四元、匯豐掛牌英美俱平、以及白銀平衡稅縮半分、入後春源永鼎康益成元茂永大德成乾昌祥洽豐永大恒恒餘等連袂脫售、竟回跌至三十八元八角、午收爲一一三九元一角、較結價抬高六元四角、結果回跌八角、現貨市况仍平、天津貨照加、十元半烚赤照加九元半、掉期由元茂永洽豐永等貼予春源永等、初爲三元六角、繼而降爲三元叫角、至於外匯市况、則頗緊臻、逮期史甚、良以華商傾意扒結也、銀行及中央趁貴均塞、惟日行及外商銀行均扒近期先令、收盤近期賣價、英匯一先令二便士三七五、美匯二十九元八一二五、較之前收、計英平而美緊〇六二五、遠期賣價、英匯一先令二便士一八七五、美匯二十九元四三二七五、較之前收、計英緊〇六二五、美緊一八七五、證券　上週公債緩緩下游　　北帮已開始抛售　　跌出一元半左右　　上週五月二十五日至三十日、華商證券交易所公債市况、爲五七兩月份期貨新舊交替時期、時局轉變、亦漸露鋒芒、華北走私嚴重、日人復增兵不已、最近北寗路忽有被阻消息、公債市場、向來寗靜、至此亦不能保持其原有狀態、維持者亦無能爲力、套利交易絕跡、投資份子裹足、上週之緩緩下游、當爲跌風之初步、視北帮之開始抛賣、接近銀行界之各經紀人賣出、不難窺其全豹、上週經過、週一爲五月份期貨最後一天、軋多軋空、互有消長、市價比較、小一二角至半元、週二祇做六月份期貨一個月交易較少、上落亦微、但終疲軟無神、週三有七月份期貨開拍之第一日、交易略增、市况由平疲而轉混沌、以上三日經過、完全處於恍惚迷離局勢中、環境變化、亦有以似之、週四爲五月份期貨交割之期、停市一天、週五因華北增兵、加之海　制之不完整、英日間亦多齟齬、人心轉虛、北帮及大戶開始賣出、小半元、週六北寗路忽有謠言、上日之賣戶、繼續湧瀉、北帶拋售允猛、向極安定之九六、亦跌去七角、餘亦小三六角、山雨欲來、前途難樂觀、一週市價結果、比前週略跌一元三角至一元七角不等、成交總數、共計二千八百三十一萬元、茲將其漲跌結果、比較列表於左、海味　菌菰售盤堅疲不同　　蔴菰至稀存薄現届素汛時令、正値各地需要繁旺之際、然產地來貨甚缺、更兼街存稀薄、故號貨居奇、行貨扳緊、市上售盤、因以日見喊高、昨聞行家兜售、廟大北口價九百四十元、裏八旗貨八百五十元、廟中口丁刻市統街斷貨、雖出高價、亦乏貨應市、裏八旗口丁售過七百八十元、至八百元、市勢堅挺、後盤或有再漲之可能、　　冬菰尙稱穩定　刻下行家存貨、均已焙曬干燥、以防霉汛期之腐壞、而備秋季再行出售、現下各產地來貨亦不見湧、市况尙稱穩定、售價大阪貨高檔四百二十元、普通四百元、下檔二百六七十元、國產江西屯溪蘭溪等貨三百十元、至二百七八十元、　菰二百二三十元、至一百八十元、　　香菌抬高抑低　　存底高貨較缺、而以中下檔居多、致成抬高抑低之局勢、現售屯溪大片貨二百元、勻片一百五六十元、建嶺菌一百四十五元、建統菌一百三十五元、至一百二十五元、市形平疲、絲茶　祁門茶業改塲所製祁紅　　得最高盤—二百七十五元　　全國經濟委員會農業處實業部暨安徽省建設廳、於兩年前會同在祁設立祁門茶業改良塲、主持祁紅生產製造改良事宜事業、設備費由全國經濟委員會農業處負擔、辦事經常費山實業部暨安徽省建設廳分擔、本年該塲精製紅茶四十六箱、運滬牌名祁紅、經中外茶師品評、認爲該茶做工。葉底。顔色。水味。香氣等在祁紅中均稱上乘、聞已由經委會農業處辦理茶業聯合推銷駐滬專員辦事處、售與怡和洋行得價二百七十五元、爲祁紅近數年來最高開盤價格云、糧食　河下米價均見緊勢　　（滬南）昨到十餘號貨共三千餘名、薄稻居多厚粳因本街略動、已能見秀角許、薄稻高料因包胃祇北洋帮辦二三　、又以來貨多、致行情續修幾分、惟中市者以零胃略爽、形勢亦現帶緊、杜洋尖及陰變隨粳市亦好近角、　　（滬北）昨日來源二十四五艘、市上白粳去胃活動、高料價緊起數分、中次者加一角外、薄稻零銷高料續化、中次交平，陰變銷路動化、加五六分、羊尖定立、杜埠客尖去化稍轉活絡、價緊數分、其餘各貨亦見緊勢、近日檔口下到貨不旺存船的百二三十號、照此到貨寥落、後市尙有續昻未奇、紗花　上週最後兩日之外棉　　二十九日美棉開盤、利物浦消息良好、東部缺雨西部續雨、業外需要較廣紡織市况進步市價挺秀、利物沛帮爲大買主、華爾街同業及紐奧崙　吸收套賣及多頭了結之額、惜現貨商售出十月期、及華盛頓方面不定、未能步升、海斯德估計本週廠用爲二二一、〇〇〇包、利物浦存底爲二九〇、〇〇〇包、計現貨漲一磅音、期貨漲一至九磅音、英棉現貨漲三點、期貨漲一點、印棉初因空戶大補及期貨商買進而堅、後因歐洲出口商賣出而回、計平果爾漲〇·五至一羅比、奧姆辣漲〇·二五至一·二五羅比、白羅溪漲〇·二五至二·二五羅比、　　三十日紐的美棉停市、佈紐奧崙交易所有市、現貨漲二磅音、期貨漲跌一二磅昔、英棉停市印棉期貨商及投機家一致買進、有著名操業者大補空額、歐洲出口商稍賣七八月期及四五月期白羅溪花、結果平果爾漲一·七五至二·一五羅比、奧姆辣漲一·二五至三·七五羅比、白羅溪漲二至四·五羅比、原電錄左、　　又據孟買電、一日白羅溪花開盤預測、爲二百十羅比、較漲一羅比、</p>

<p>(Beiping) Last night, Song Zheyuan summoned local authorities of Beiping and Tianjin, as well as division commanders of the 29th Army, to his private residence to discuss in detail the recent proliferation of rumors in Beiping and Tianjin, the resulting unease among the populace, and methods to maintain order. Song personally instructed all responsible personnel to take utmost responsibility in maintaining public order in Beiping and Tianjin and stabilizing social order. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tonight, Xiao Zhenying will depart from Beiping and return to Tianjin, accompanied by Zhang Zizhong. Xiao stated that he is going to inspect and manage everything due to the proliferation of rumors in Tianjin. As matters in Beiping are not yet completed, he will return to Beiping within two or three days. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) With Japan increasing its troop presence in North China, rumors have spread like wildfire in Beiping and Tianjin, causing extreme unease among the people. According to a certain authority, the rumors circulating outside are not to be believed. The authorities here have made the utmost determination to make every effort to maintain local public order, and will absolutely not be remiss in their duties. Seeing the proliferation of rumors in Tianjin, Song ordered Xiao to immediately return to Tianjin to take charge. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 31st, the military police of Tianjin were on special alert. Each school and college had a large contingent of security police stationed to prevent students from forming protest groups. Fortunately, nothing happened throughout the day. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Zhang Zizhong and Xiao Zhenying took a train from Beiping to Tianjin on the 31st for diplomatic matters. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tonight, Song Zheyuan stated that the rumors arising in North China are due to Japan increasing its troop presence in Beiping and Tianjin, which has caused unease in the region. According to reports, the Kawabe Brigade, sent by the Japanese army, is being transported continuously. He only met the Kawabe Brigade Commander during a banquet at Matsumuro’s residence. The point of contention regarding the situation in North China lies in the preservation of our national sovereignty. Since the establishment of the Tanggu Truce on May 31, 1933, Sino-Japanese diplomacy has been ongoing but complex and convoluted. He believes that negotiations must be premised on not infringing upon sovereignty and not invading our territory. Matsumuro met with him twice yesterday and the day before. On the first day, they discussed the international situation after the European war. On the second day, he indicated that he was responsible as the representative of the Japanese army. He is scheduled to have a third meeting today. He is prepared to raise two points: 1. The issue of Japan increasing its troop presence; 2. The Japanese newspaper published a warning to Zheyuan. However, as of now, Matsumuro has not yet come to visit. As for the case of the Han person killed in Yiqing, the Japanese side directly arrested the suspect, which infringes upon our sovereignty. Negotiations are currently underway to release the arrested person. Since the rumors arose in North China, the government has been extremely concerned. Some days ago, the Foreign Minister dispatched Gao Zongwu, Director of the Asian Affairs Department, to Beiping. At the same time, the central government also sent personnel to Beiping. Regarding Sino-Japanese diplomatic issues, the Japanese side may have considerable developments. The issue of Japanese troops stationed in Fengtai has not yet been reported, nor has the Japanese side formally notified us. The Japanese side considers student parades to be extremely serious. In reality, students have not taken any actions that disrupt local public order in recent days, so there seems to be no need to make a mountain out of a molehill, which only increases local unease. Yesterday, Nagami, Chief of Staff of the Tianjin Garrison Army, came to Beiping and met with him, representing Commander Tadashiro to thank all parties, and returned to Tianjin that evening. Tadashiro has no definite date to come to Beiping. He is currently occupied with matters here and will not leave Beiping in the short term. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Xiao Zhenying and Zhang Zizhong will remain in Tianjin for two or three days, devoting themselves to diplomacy. In a day, they will visit Tadashiro, Matsumuro, Nagami, and others, hoping to break the deadlock. The issue of Eastern Hebei is no longer an urgent matter and will not be discussed for the time being. Song has no intention of coming to Tianjin. Tadashiro will go to Beiping around the 20th. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A certain important person stated that most of the rumors circulating outside are fabricated by those who seek illegitimate gains. Diplomatic efforts in Hebei and Chahar have not been abandoned; it is only that the negotiation methods differ. One or two responsible negotiators feel physically exhausted and see fewer guests, which creates more opportunities for rumor-mongers. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Wang Yitang, a member of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Commission, went to Tianjin at 9:30 AM on the 31st. (31st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Tonight, it is widely rumored here that Song Zheyuan and Xiao Zhenying have both resigned. This is not due to the railway bombing case, but rather because the current diplomatic situation is difficult to handle. However, the details are not yet known today. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Gao Zongwu, Director of the Asian Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, flew from Nanjing to Beiping at around 1:00 PM on the 29th. On the morning of the 30th, he told reporters that he had been away from Beiping for several years and that his visit was purely for travel purposes and he did not have any specific tasks. He has not decided whether to visit Chairman Song in Beiping, but he will speak with personnel from the Hebei-Chahar Foreign Affairs Committee. Regarding the issue of smuggling in North China, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is only responsible for the diplomatic negotiations, while the prevention and crackdown measures are currently being meticulously planned by the Ministry of Finance. When reporters subsequently inquired about the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' negotiations with Japan regarding the recent increase in troops in North China, and diplomatic affairs in Hebei and Chahar, Gao replied that he had just arrived in Beiping and had nothing else to say. Later, he added that he would only stay in Beiping for three or four days before returning to Nanjing and would not travel elsewhere. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Last night, Song Zheyuan convened a special meeting of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Commission to discuss the issue of Japan increasing its troop presence in North China. Xiao Zhenying and Qin Dechun, the Mayor of Beiping, both attended the meeting. At the same time, high-ranking Japanese military officers and the special agent Matsumuro are all gathered in Tianjin. Song Zheyuan told Chinese news reporters that a newspaper in Beiping stated that the Japanese military authorities would soon issue a strong warning to him. He said that this news does not help the overall situation or Sino-Japanese relations. He has decided that when he meets with Matsumuro, he will ask him to explain the so-called warning in the Japanese newspaper. (31st Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Xiamen) Smuggling has resurged in southern Fujian. Customs investigations have found that 30,000 cases of smuggled matches have been smuggled in the past two months, of which 5,000 cases have been seized.

<p>British Newspapers Unanimously Criticize Japanese Policy</p>
<p>(London) The severity of the smuggling problem in North China has attracted close attention from all quarters in China. Mr. Marshall, Chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, recently sent a telegram to the British Foreign Office, the Overseas Trade Department, and the Chambers of Commerce in London, Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Bristol, and Edinburgh, advocating that the anti-smuggling work of the Chinese Customs should not be interfered with. All major newspapers here have prominently featured and commented on the situation in North China, denouncing Japanese claims that the Chinese Customs is ineffective in anti-smuggling efforts and that tax rates are too high as pretexts. They unanimously feel uneasy about the significant threat to British economic interests in North China. The Manchester Guardian stated that the London Stock Market has paid close attention to this matter in the past ten days. Even the usually cautious Morning Post stated that the effectiveness of the Chinese Customs has been completely destroyed by the Japanese army and navy. An editorial in The Times on the 18th stated that since the establishment of the Tanggu Truce, Chinese police and customs authorities have been unable to perform their duties in the war zone, resulting in the area south of the Great Wall becoming a haven for criminals. The Japanese authorities still claim that the severity of the smuggling problem is due to the ineffectiveness of customs patrols and excessively high tariffs, ignoring the fact that Chief Inspector of Customs, Mr. Maze, has already pointed out that the crux of the matter lies in the customs being forced to disarm, rendering them unable to perform their duties. This kind of sophistry by the Japanese shows that it is not just a local armed action, but rather an intentional government policy. (31st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e4">After the Bombing of the Beining Railway Track, Tadashiro Invites Officers to Discuss Opinions on the Current Situation <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Matsumuro Plans to Return to Beiping Immediately to Meet Song, Many Doubts Arise About the Bombing Incident, Tianjin Authorities are Strictly Pursuing the Culprits</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Kawabe Brigade Commander and Aide Noguchi arrived in Tianjin at 9:00 AM on the 31st. Matsumuro arrived in Tianjin at noon on the 31st. At 4:00 PM, Tadashiro gathered Kawabe, Matsumuro, Nagami, Iida, Ishii, Nakai, Otake, Kawada, and other staff officers and aides, as well as the commander of the Kayashima 2nd Infantry Regiment, at the Zhangyuan residence to discuss opinions on the situation in North China. The meeting ended at 6:00 PM. Matsumuro plans to return to Beiping by train tonight or on the morning of the 1st to meet with Song. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The newly added Japanese Brigade Commander Kawabe and Matsui, attached to the Tianjin Garrison Headquarters, went to Tianjin this morning one after the other. They were summoned by Japanese Commander Tadashiro for discussions and will return to Beiping within days. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese side’s attitude toward the bombing of the Beining Railway track is moderate and a resolution is expected to be reached according to normal diplomatic procedures. Shi Jisheng, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, returned to Tianjin on the morning of the 31st. On the 1st, he will convene a meeting of the bureau chiefs on behalf of Xiao to discuss methods for maintaining public order. The key to the Beining Railway bombing case lies in the study of the time of the incident. The Japanese side claims that it occurred at 8:20 AM, but at 10:10 AM, Japanese soldiers rode a special train to inspect the Tianjin-Tanggu Railway and safely passed through the damaged area, stopping at Zhangguizhuang. The driver did not see any damage to the track. The Railway Bureau believes that if the time claimed by the Japanese side is accurate, the railway workers would never have failed to discover and report it during the four hours between that time and the departure of the through train to Shenyang from the Tianjin station. Although the perpetrator cannot be clearly identified, the special train departing from Tianjin at 10:10 AM shows that our side had absolutely no involvement. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At 10:00 PM on the 29th, the Tianjin Japanese military requested a special train of four carriages from the Beining Railway, carrying soldiers and Japanese in plain clothes, numbering over a hundred. The train left Xinhao, stopping along the way and inspecting the tracks after getting off. At Zhangguizhuang Station, more than fifty got off and informed railway staff, and the train stopped. It returned to Tianjin on the morning of the 30th. At the same time, some Japanese went to nearby bridges to inspect. At noon, a railway track 8km from Tianjin was blown up. Upon learning of the incident, the Railway Bureau urgently sent personnel to investigate with members of the Japanese military. Traffic on the Tanggu-Tianjin line was interrupted. Two trains of Japanese soldiers and a train to Shenyang were blocked in Tanggu and Tianjin. At 4:00 AM on the 30th, traffic was restored after workers were dispatched to repair the damage. The Japanese military trains arrived in Tianjin at 5:18 AM and 9:50 AM, respectively. The first train carried 500 soldiers, 400 of whom got off at the new barracks in Dongjuzi. The remaining 100 soldiers continued to Beiping on the same train. The second train carried 50 soldiers, eight cannons, seven tanks, five armored vehicles, and a large amount of military supplies. Regarding the track bombing, the Japanese military has taken films to study the responsibility. The Railway Bureau stated that the journey from Tianjin East Station to Zhangguizhuang usually takes only ten minutes, but the special train on the 29th took forty minutes to arrive, and the Japanese freely stopped and got on and off along the way. The details of this do not need to be explicitly stated and it is evident that we were not involved. This morning, the Japanese side has not yet made any comments. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the night of the 29th, Sugai, a captain of the Tianjin Japanese military police, repeatedly invited responsible personnel from the Tianjin County government by telephone to discuss matters. Because it was after hours, Bai Lunbi, the chief of the public security section, was notified at 11:45 PM. He reported to County Magistrate Chen Zhongyue and went to meet him. There, Sugai invited him into a small room, locked the door, and questioned him, saying that at 8:20 PM on the night of the 29th, the second train of Japanese soldiers was bombed en route to Tianjin East Station, injuring one carriage and three horses. The incident occurred in Tianjin County, so he hoped to investigate and reply. After returning, Bai reported this and relayed it to Liu Jialuan, the commander of the security forces. That same night, Sun Weidong, the head of the Tianjin Public Security Bureau, was also invited by Fujii, commander of the Japanese military police, who said that anti-Japanese leaflets were discovered at the East Station at 8:20 PM and requested an investigation. After returning, Sun investigated in detail and found nothing of the sort. However, he ordered the head of the third branch to arrest the culprits within three days. On the morning of the 30th, the head of the public security branch of the county government, Yang, went to inspect the bombed track, where he found a film wrapper with the words "Made in Tokyo" printed on it. He submitted it to the Security Command for reference. It was proven that Japanese soldiers had taken photos after the incident and the wrapper was abandoned by them, which had nothing to do with the bombing itself. On the 31st, the Japanese side dismissed the rumors, believing the item to be packaging material for explosives and insisted that it be sent over. The Security Department photographed it for records and then sent it over. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The authorities are strictly pursuing the culprits in the bombing of the Beining Railway track. Du Jie, the head of the sixth branch of the Public Security Bureau, was given a major demerit for negligence in prevention, as the incident occurred in his jurisdiction. It is reported that two railway police officers from the Beining Railway have been detained. (31st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Tianjin Municipal Public Security Bureau issued an order to its subordinates on the 30th, limiting them to three days to capture and investigate the culprits who damaged the Beining Railway track. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) There are many conflicting stories about the bombing incident on the Tianjin-Tanggu Railway. According to the latest news, there were two explosions on the line within a few hours, not just one. Therefore, the doubts surrounding this matter have increased. It has been investigated that there were two Japanese military trains arriving in Tianjin from Tanggu on Friday evening. The first one arrived at the East Station at 6:50 PM, and the second one carried 700 soldiers and arrived at the station at 8:20 PM. According to the Japanese, the second train was bombed somewhere a few miles from Tianjin East, but the Japanese side did not say whether a bomb was buried under the tracks or a bomb was thrown. At 10:15 PM, 30 Japanese soldiers requested to use a handcar, but their request was not granted. They then boarded a special train and told the station staff that they wanted to inspect the railway to Xinhao (phonetic). They departed at 11:13 PM. At that time, the Japanese soldiers did not inform the station staff about the 8:20 PM bombing of the military train, otherwise, the station staff would not have allowed the midnight express train to Shenyang to leave Tianjin. Chinese sources only mentioned an explosion near the 14th Bridge at midnight, and said that the Shenyang express train was stopped after the incident. Another account said that a freight train from Tanggu had arrived in Tianjin between the arrival of the 8:20 PM military train and the departure of the Shenyang express train. According to this, even if the 8:20 PM military train was bombed, the tracks were not damaged. Railway personnel claimed that they did not know about the 8:20 PM bombing of the military train until Japanese military officers came to Tianjin East Station on the morning of the 31st to inspect the damaged vehicle. The number of Chinese military police stationed in various schools has increased today, as today is the anniversary of the Tanggu Truce. (31st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Last night, an explosion occurred on the Beining Railway between Tianjin and Tanggu, damaging a section of the track. A train of Japanese soldiers carrying newly exchanged troops from Tanggu to Tianjin, as well as a freight car carrying cavalry livestock, were also damaged, injuring two horses, but no Japanese soldiers were injured. The train was still able to use its own power to drive to Tianjin. The express train to Shenyang, fully loaded with passengers, left Tianjin at midnight and was fortunately stopped in time, avoiding a disaster. The explosion site was near the 14th Bridge. The Japanese military authorities issued an official notice stating that the explosion site was three miles from Tianjin East Station. The Japanese authorities have begun an investigation and found that the bomb was placed under the track, and the length was 25 meters. The weight of the locomotive was enough to detonate it. The express train to Shenyang was stopped due to the warning of the railway police. This alertness of the railway police saved many lives. The express train then returned to Tianjin, but set off to Shenyang again at 6:00 AM this morning, as the track had been repaired overnight. After receiving this news, the Japanese authorities in Tianjin immediately dispatched a team of machine gunners to the East Station to inspect the tracks at the scene and take magnesium photographs. Only after the investigation was completed were workers allowed to go to repair the road. The last freight train that passed through the area before the explosion was a special train carrying thirty Japanese soldiers, which departed from the East Station at 11:13 PM on the night of the 29th. According to Chinese sources, this train had three cars, with machine gunners on board, seemingly ordered to inspect the Tianjin and Tanggu tracks, as if the Japanese authorities were worried that the military train from Tanggu might be ambushed en route. It is said that the soldiers on the train got off at Zhangguizhuang before the explosion. The Japanese special train was originally scheduled to depart from Tanggu at 10:00 PM last night, but was postponed to 9:50 AM this morning. After arriving in Tianjin, it transferred to Tongzhou. The Japanese military has questioned the Chinese Railway Bureau, saying that last night's explosion was intended to destroy the Japanese military train. In fact, the Chinese Railway Bureau has been paying special attention to preventing everything in recent days due to the Japanese military's deployment and the tense situation after the student demonstrations. The Railway Bureau went to the explosion site for investigation this afternoon. As for the exact time of the explosion, it is still not possible to determine it today. It was approximately after 11:30 PM and before 12:00 AM. The Railway Bureau then published an article, but did not mention the results of the investigation, only saying that a patrolman found that the joint of the two tracks was raised at 12:30 AM this morning, and went to investigate closely, and saw a huge hole in the ground, destroying two sleepers. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The newspapers tonight published news of the Beining Railway bombing case, mostly using headlines such as "North China Crisis" and "Japan May Have New Major Actions in North China." The newspapers did not add any comments, only adding a few words after the telegram, recounting the Shenyang Incident and saying that the Sino-Japanese situation in North China is tense, especially due to the increase in the number of Japanese garrison troops. All these matters are very noteworthy. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e8">Observations on the Japan-Australia Trade War <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>Since the Australian government promulgated new tariff rules to exclude Japanese imports of rayon cotton fabrics and other goods, Tokyo has been planning countermeasures and retaliation. The authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry are actively consulting. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry has even drafted a counter-offensive plan to impose quotas on Australian wool and wheat imports into Japan. If the imports exceed the quota, they will be absolutely prohibited. If this plan is implemented, its validity will be three years. The deterioration of Japan-Australia relations is also the rupture of Anglo-Japanese friendship and the increased tension in the Far East.</p>
<p>According to news from the Domei News Agency, the Japanese government and business community are quite angry about the Australian government's decision. There is much clamor for retaliation in the government and among the public. The Japan Wool Textile Industry Association, which imports 600,000 bales of Australian wool each year, recently held a meeting and decided to purchase wool from South Africa and South America to replace Australian goods. Eight organizations, including cotton textile companies and rayon textile companies, also held a joint meeting in Osaka and decided to support the government. The overseas trade department of the Osaka Chamber of Commerce also requested the government to use all retaliatory methods to counter Australia. Most noteworthy is that all major newspapers across the country have published articles attacking Australia, and their attitude is even tougher than that of the government and the business community.</p>
<p>It can be asserted that the inevitable trade war between Japan and Australia and the economic warfare will have serious political consequences. Australia's resolute exclusion of Japanese goods has been determined, and its main driver is obviously in Great Britain. The Japanese Consul-General in Australia, Murai, sent an official letter to the Australian Minister of Customs to protest and request a reconsideration. The Japanese side believes that Australia's response is insincere and has protested again, expressing the important determination of the Japanese government and public to request a practical response from Australia. The breakdown of negotiations is imminent. Japan relies on Australia for wool raw materials, cotton textiles, and rayon markets. Australia also accounts for an important share. Those with discerning eyes can understand the benefits and harms of the commercial war.</p>
<p>Japan has long coveted Australia. Australia is Japan's most ideal colony. Australia's population is sparser than that of the four northeastern provinces, and the climate is warm and suitable for Japanese colonization. Since the White Australia policy has been prevalent, the Australian government passed laws prohibiting Japanese and Chinese immigrants, and Japan has harbored resentment. Recently, there have been reports of Japanese people sneaking into Australia. Australia's agricultural, mining, animal, and plant products are all urgently needed by Japan, such as wool, wheat, gold, and iron, which are necessary for modern industrial countries. Australia can supply most of them. Moreover, Australia is rich in land and sparsely populated, and the purchasing power of the people is extremely high. Ordinary people are wealthier than those in Britain and the United States. If the promotion of Japanese goods is unhindered, it will be enough to bring relief to the industry around Osaka and save countless poor and unemployed people from the predicament of having no food or clothing. This is the main reason why Japan cannot forget about Australia.</p>
<p>In recent years, Britain's international position has declined, and its military strength in the Far East has become insufficient. Although the development of aircraft and wireless telegraph has brought the relationship between London and Australia and New Zealand closer, there is a lack of reach in terms of national defense and trade. The Australian people know that once Japan develops south of the equator, its seizure of Australia is as easy as catching a turtle in a jar. It is quite difficult for Britain's army, navy, and air force to protect this corner of the world. Therefore, Australia has recently advocated relying on the United States to consolidate itself. The United States has also advocated merging the British Empire's dominions in the Pacific to form a large English-speaking nation alliance. The rise of Japanese power is the biggest concern of the British Empire and the most important factor in the changing world map.</p>
<p>Japan has decided to wage an economic war with Australia. Whether to compromise or resist depends on London's decision.</p>
<h3 id="e9">The 20th International Labour Conference <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>The conference will open this Thursday in Geneva</p>
<p>Representatives from 61 countries will attend</p>
<p>Italy, Germany, and Japan will all participate</p>
<p>(Geneva) The 20th International Labour Conference is scheduled to open here on June 4th. Representatives from as many as 61 countries will attend. Although Italy refuses to participate in other aspects of the League of Nations, it is still sending representatives to the Labour Conference (with representatives from the government, employers, and workers). Furthermore, the United States and Japan, although not members of the League of Nations, will also participate in the conference. Only Germany has withdrawn from the International Labour Office and will not be sending representatives. The agenda for this conference includes a total of eight items, five of which are related to the 40-hour work week. This system is urgently demanded by workers in all countries, especially those in France. The 19th International Labour Conference, held on June 22nd last year, has already passed a public resolution. All signatory countries have already agreed in principle to this system, mutually agreeing not to reduce existing wages, and to separately formulate individual resolutions, stipulating implementation details, to ensure that various industries can adopt this system. The glass industry has already implemented it last year. What will be discussed at this conference is based on the public resolution established last year, so that public works construction, civil engineering, coal mining, and the textile industry can all adopt this system. Two other issues should also be discussed: one is the issue of workers having a certain number of days of paid vacation each year, and the other is the issue of employing indigenous workers in the colonies. Regarding the first issue, the International Labour Conference has previously expressed its support in principle, and this conference will continue the discussion in the hope of formulating a public resolution. As for other issues, such as the redistribution of raw materials worldwide, the report should be submitted and read out at this conference. (29th Havas dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e12">League of Nations Opium Committee Resolution: Imploring Japan to Eliminate the Scourge of Drugs in China; Severe Punishment Should Be Given to Japanese Nationals Illicitly Trafficking in China; Satisfied with Our Achievements in Combating Drugs; Hu Shize Cables Chiang to Report on the Geneva Conference <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Advisory Committee on Opium Problems has accepted the resolution on the Far East Opium Report drafted by the US representative Fuller, Swiss representative Gallier, and Indian representative Hardie. The resolution raises particular concern about the increasing severity of the opium situation in China and the illicit trafficking and manufacturing of drugs. It states that since the Chinese representative has submitted a complaint, other governments should provide practical assistance. The resolution states that the cause of the rampant drugs in China is that the punishments imposed by Japan on illicit traffickers and manufacturers of drugs are too light, and insufficient to deter others. This situation is not only enough to ruin China, but also endangers the world. Therefore, the whole world should assist China in eliminating drugs. The resolution expresses satisfaction with the various efforts China has taken within its capabilities to combat drugs, and hopes that it will continue unabated, and requests China to report all circumstances to Geneva for review at any time. As for the Japanese government, it implores it to intensify its crackdown on illicit trafficking and manufacturing, and to impose severe punishments on all illegal activities, and to make every effort to prevent Japanese people from engaging in illegal activities in China. It is generally recognized that the speech delivered by the US representative on the occasion was sufficient to demonstrate his insight into the situation in China and his willingness to provide assistance to China.

<p>The new French cabinet will be established soon; Britain's attitude towards Italy is urgently needed to be decided</p>
<p>Political figures here recently declared that the international diplomatic situation will enter an active stage due to the following three factors: 1. Italy has expressed its willingness to approach Britain; 2. Argentina has requested an early convening of the League of Nations General Assembly; 3. The new French cabinet can be established soon. Regarding the issue of sanctions, experts from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have submitted a report to the government, stating that the current sanctions measures should either be abolished directly or be amended, and one of the two options should be chosen. It is not appropriate to delay the decision. The government is still hoping to find a plan that will allow Italy to rejoin the collective security mechanism, while the member states of the League of Nations will not be forced to recognize Italy's annexation of Abyssinia, and the aggressive policy pursued by Italy, which has been solemnly condemned by those countries, will not be easily endorsed, so as to avoid the suspicion of going back on their word. However, if the extraordinary meeting of the Executive Council of the League of Nations, which will be held on the 15th of next month, still fails to make a decision on the issue of sanctions, it is feared that it will affect the international situation. Therefore, the British government should accept the proposal of the Argentine government and submit the issue of sanctions to the League of Nations General Assembly for discussion. However, the General Assembly will be slightly postponed, and it will not be convened immediately after the meeting of the Executive Council as requested by Argentina. (30th Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>Rumored to be Indirectly Initiated by Italy, Seeking to Take Advantage of the Opportunity to Urge the Lifting of Sanctions</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Argentine government has requested an early convening of the League of Nations Assembly, requesting it to discuss the following three issues: the issue of sanctions against Italy, declaring non-recognition of Italy's annexation of Abyssinia, and revising the League of Nations Covenant. It is learned that the country's representative, Mr. Garaizi, is scheduled to visit the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Mr. Avenol, tomorrow to submit this request in writing. According to League of Nations officials, Argentina's request is likely to be accepted by the League of Nations. This reporter has also learned that if Argentina does not obtain satisfaction before the 15th of next month, its representative will, during the meeting of the Administrative Council, together with representatives of several other countries, insist on this claim, and will not stop until the goal is achieved. (29th Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding Argentina's request for an early convening of the League of Nations Assembly, well-informed sources here believe that this was initiated by Italy and is closely related to Italian Ambassador Grandi's recent visit to Foreign Secretary Eden to attempt to ease tensions between the two sides. It is speculated that when the League of Nations Assembly convenes, Italy will take the opportunity to pressure the member states of the League of Nations to urge the lifting of the current sanctions, so that the smaller countries can freely express their support or opposition. Political figures also stated that Ambassador Grandi, during his recent visit to Foreign Secretary Eden, advocated clarifying the current atmosphere through appropriate procedures, and did not firmly insist on the immediate lifting of sanctions. This is noteworthy.

<h3 id="e34">Argentina's True Intentions Arouse Various Speculations <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>(Rome) Gaida, a famous reporter for the semi-official Italian "People's Voice," recently commented on Argentina's request for an early convening of the League of Nations Assembly, stating, "Based on the current facts, it is difficult to interpret the true intentions of the Argentine government. What is known is that although the country has endorsed the sanctions policy, it has not implemented it. The countries of South America are generally not very enthusiastic about the League of Nations, but Argentina has a tendency to sympathize with the League of Nations. In addition, Britain has a significant investment in Argentina, and the two sides are closely linked. That's all. As for Argentina's request to convene the League of Nations Assembly, the issues to be discussed are the sanctions against Italy and the non-recognition of Italy's annexation of Abyssinia, which are not absolutely related. We do not need to study Argentina's actions in detail. Geneva is discussing this issue, and Italy no longer feels interested or involved, but should see how it is resolved and then decide on the future policy direction of the country." (31st Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>(Paris) Foreign Ministry officials recently speculated about Argentina's request for the League of Nations Assembly to convene early on June 16, believing that this and the Brazilian government's recent ambiguous response to Italy's request for recognition of the annexation of Abyssinia, without explicitly rejecting it, were mutually reinforcing. (Note: The Brazilian government recently replied to Italy, stating that it had consulted the United States and other South American countries and that it would be discussed by the Pan-American Peace Conference.) Another explanation is that the countries of South America, including Argentina, have always been shocked by the military occupation of other countries' territories. For example, after the Japanese army took action in the two eastern provinces of China in September 1931, Argentine Foreign Minister Saavedra Lamas suggested concluding a treaty of non-aggression and conciliation, the second article of which stipulated that all signatory countries would not recognize any territory occupied by force. This treaty was signed in the capital of Brazil on October 10, 1933. In addition to the fifteen countries of the Americas (including the United States), Italy was the first European country to sign and participate. Therefore, Argentina's request to convene the League of Nations Assembly early to declare non-recognition of the annexation of Abyssinia is naturally a matter that should be included in the agenda.

<p>Extending Sanctions is Considered an Unfriendly Act</p>
<p>(Rome) Political figures here have expressed welcome to Argentina's request for an early convening of the League of Nations Assembly, believing that if the issue of whether or not to lift the League of Nations' sanctions against Italy were delayed until September for discussion by the Assembly, it would be not only dangerous in Italy's eyes, but also an unfriendly act. However, it is unlikely that the League of Nations' current policies can be changed at this time. If the lifting of the current sanctions depends on the will of the Administrative Council, it is not the best policy. (30th Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to well-informed sources, although the League of Nations Administrative Council is scheduled to hold an extraordinary meeting on the 16th of next month, if Italy has not obtained a guarantee regarding the lifting of the current sanctions before the meeting, it will refuse to send representatives to attend. If, after the meeting of the Administrative Council, the sanctions are still implemented and must be resolved at the regular session of the League of Nations Assembly in the autumn of this year, the situation will become tense. It is also said that Italy is very willing to adopt a compromise attitude, as can be seen from its allowing British troops to remain in Addis Ababa (the capital of Abyssinia). However, it hopes that Italy will compromise first, and other countries will then lift the sanctions as a sign of gratitude. (29th Havas News Agency)</p>

<p>The Situation Will Become More Difficult Without Prior Consultation and Handling</p>
<p>(Paris) Newspapers have widely commented on Argentina's request for an early convening of the League of Nations Assembly. Mrs. Tabouis, a famous reporter for the "L'Œuvre" newspaper, stated, "French and British cabinet members are quite surprised by this move, believing that the situation is already difficult when the League of Nations Administrative Council convenes an extraordinary meeting on the 16th of next month. If the League of Nations Assembly is convened before the major powers have agreed on a plan, the future of the situation will be even more precarious. In addition, Italian Undersecretary of State Suvich recently issued a formal statement to British Ambassador to Italy Drummond, stating that if the current sanctions are not lifted before June 15, Italy will withdraw from the League of Nations. Although this matter has not been acknowledged by all parties, it was authorized by the authorities and should not be regarded as a final decision. In this regard, the British Foreign Office advocates allowing the Administrative Council to meet as scheduled and convene the League of Nations Assembly at the end of June to achieve a compromise. What is unknown is whether Argentina and other South American countries want to remain in Geneva or are willing to adopt US President Roosevelt's proposal, thereby abandoning the League of Nations in Geneva and reorganizing the League of American Nations." (31st Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>(Paris) Political figures here generally express a favorable impression of the Argentine government's request for an early convening of the League of Nations Assembly, believing that the League of Nations Assembly only announced an adjournment at its last session and did not announce its end. Therefore, convening it now, in principle, does not pose any difficulties. However, convening the Assembly immediately after the extraordinary meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council (June 15) may be too rushed. In addition, the issues to be included in the Assembly's agenda are all very important in nature, and it would be more appropriate to delay the date slightly so that all governments can decide on their positions. In France, the future cabinet will not be formed until a few days before the extraordinary meeting of the Administrative Council, and it is difficult to predict at this time what attitude it will adopt towards Argentina's request.

<p>The Answer to the Sanctions Issue Depends on Germany</p>
<p>(Paris) "L'Écho de Paris" reported that "Argentina's move has made the British government feel embarrassed. If the issue of reorganizing the League of Nations is raised for discussion in Geneva, the British government will definitely oppose it. As for the sanctions issue, British opinions are still divided, but general public opinion advocates that Foreign Secretary Eden should cooperate with the future French cabinet." "Le Journal" reported, "Argentina's move is practical. Since the country has not implemented sanctions against Italy, its proposal is intended to maintain order in Europe, reunify various forces, and eliminate the biggest obstacles." (31st Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>(London) The Argentine government's request for an early convening of the League of Nations Assembly has greatly surprised political figures and Argentines here. According to this reporter's inquiries, British diplomatic circles did not anticipate Argentina's move, and the government was also completely unaware of it. At this time, Prime Minister Baldwin and Foreign Secretary Eden have already gone to the countryside for the Whit Monday holiday, so it is impossible to know what the official reaction is. However, according to political figures, the British government must wait to consider the reactions that may occur in other countries before deciding on its attitude. For the time being, it still advocates maintaining the status quo until September, using the next three months as a period for negotiation. The financial community generally expresses a favorable impression of Argentina's proposal, believing that with this move, the sanctions can be expected to be lifted, international trade can be revived, and the diplomatic situation can be eased. A certain figure in the financial community also stated that Britain's attitude toward Italy should depend on how Germany responds to British questions. If Germany's answer can completely satisfy Britain, proving that Germany is not helping Italy, then Britain can consider tightening sanctions against Italy; otherwise, it will inevitably lift the sanctions. (29th Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>(London) The Associated Press learned today that a foreign minister of a certain continental European country clearly told British Foreign Secretary Eden that if Britain does not agree to lift sanctions against Italy, it should decisively block the Suez Canal, and said that if Britain can do so, the country is very willing to help, even resorting to force if necessary. The authorities are currently unwilling to reveal which country it is. Judging from the situation, Britain seems unwilling to take any action against Italy that would lead to a war between Britain and Italy. However, the general public's attitude has become firm and tough due to Italy's recent attempts to undermine British interests in Egypt, Palestine, Arabia, etc. (29th National Telegram)</p>

<p>A Solution Has Not Yet Matured; Italy Denies Threatening Britain</p>
<p>(London) Newspapers have widely commented on the current international situation. "The Observer" reported that Italian Ambassador Grandi's recent visit to Foreign Secretary Eden was the beginning of negotiations between Britain and Italy. "Both Britain and Italy now recognize that before the League of Nations Administrative Council holds an extraordinary meeting on the 16th of next month, an understanding must be reached between the two countries. This is an urgent matter and cannot be delayed. Moreover, the possibility of an understanding between the two countries is not non-existent. Even the issue of lifting sanctions can hopefully be resolved without embarrassing the British government. As for the solution, it is only necessary to revise the agreement previously concluded between Britain and Italy in December 1925 (which stipulates that the Lake Tana area in western Abyssinia is within the British sphere of influence) and replace the words 'Emperor of Abyssinia' in the agreement with the words 'Italian Government.' In other words, the right of cession requested by the British government will be voluntarily granted to Britain by the Italian government." "The Sunday Dispatch" reported, "Prime Minister Baldwin and Foreign Secretary Eden are now working hard to prevent Italy from withdrawing from the League of Nations, and Britain still supports the policies of the League of Nations. Once the Whit Monday holiday is over, they will consult with experts from the Foreign Office on this matter. However, political figures are currently keeping the matter secret because a solution has not yet matured, and it is also necessary to know in advance what views the future French cabinet holds." (31st Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>(London) It was rumored that Italian Ambassador Grandi had recently issued a statement to Foreign Secretary Eden, stating that if the League of Nations Administrative Council still decides to maintain the current sanctions at its meeting next month, Italy will withdraw from the League of Nations. Italians here have denied this, and British officials have also denied this, saying that Ambassador Grandi did not make any threatening remarks during his visit to the Foreign Secretary. Ambassador's move should be regarded as an effort by the Italian government to ease tensions between Britain and Italy. (30th Havas News Agency)</p>

<p>(Rome) The Cabinet met at 10 am today to discuss many important issues, lasting for three hours. One of the events decided was to set up a special fund, initially set at 100 million lire, to carry out public works in Abyssinia. According to an order from the authorities, the funds will be raised by issuing stocks in Italy and using foreign currency. This shows that Italy may raise foreign debt to finance Abyssinia's development. (31st Reuters News Agency)</p>
<p>(Rome) Agriculture Minister Rossoni gave a speech at the General Assembly of Agricultural Groups this afternoon, explaining the significance of Italy's future colonial undertakings in Abyssinia and criticizing the colonial methods adopted by various countries in the past, stating that colonial countries only knew how to use colonial resources but did not know how to fully develop them, and did not know how to develop the productive capacity of the people. This error is clearly visible. Fascist colonizers in our country are different. They will not only diligently engage in reclamation but will also patiently guide the people to improve their abilities. Even if they cannot keep pace with fascist colonizers, they can at least follow in their footsteps and jointly seek development." (30th Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>(Rome) A delegation from the Italian business survey flew from here to the Abyssinian capital yesterday. Its task is to study the possibility of developing trade between the Italian mainland and Abyssinia and to establish a foundation for Abyssinia's commercial organization. The tentative plan is for the Italian Federation of Commerce to set up department stores in important locations in Abyssinia, send personnel to various parts of the interior to promote Italian goods, purchase local specialties, and, to the extent possible, implement a barter system. It is reported that there were more than 50 staff members of the Federation of Commerce in the expeditionary force who set off with the army. The above-mentioned commercial organization plan should be implemented by these staff members first and then gradually expanded. (29th Havas News Agency)</p>

<p>Merger of Domei and Dentsu Realized</p>
<p>(Tokyo) As the international situation becomes increasingly complex, Japan feels the need to build a powerful communications company. With the mediation of government authorities and the cooperation of major newspapers and the Japan Broadcasting Corporation, the former News Federation was first used as a model to form the Domei News Agency, a public interest corporation, which began operations on January 1 of this year. This time, the Japan Telegraph and Telephone Corporation also believes that it is a national communication undertaking and is willing to assist, and is willing to merge the communication department of the company into Domei. Therefore, the branches and sub-branches of the two companies, both domestic and foreign, totaling more than 70, have been fully merged on May 31. At the same time, various newspaper companies that had never participated in the past have also joined Domei. At this point, it has become the only large communications company that unites newspapers across Japan, and is scheduled to start anew under the name of Domei News Agency on June 1. The company will strengthen both domestic and foreign relations in order to live up to its name and become a large communications agency representing Japan. Furthermore, the advertising department of Domei News Agency will also merge with the advertising department of the Japan Telegraph and Telephone Corporation at the same time. In the future, Domei, a communications agency, and Dentsu, an advertising agency, will become very close sisters, and the agencies will cooperate with each other to contribute to the world.

<p>(Tokyo) In order to cope with the naval expansion plans of Britain and the United States, the Navy intends to consolidate Japan's national defense in the western Pacific, maintain self-defense naval forces, and complete the budget for the expansion of new military preparations from the next fiscal year in order to implement it. Various preparations are currently underway, and during the budget preparation period, there will be thorough discussions with the military administration and military orders authorities. The budget for the next fiscal year will focus on the construction of new ships, the improvement of land and water, and the increase of air force strength, etc., and the planned expansion of new military preparations will require a huge amount of funds. The amount requested by the Navy will inevitably far exceed the 700 million yuan in the Showa 11th year, which is an unavoidable situation. (31st Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The annual meeting of the Japanese Navy Chief of Staff will be held in the conference room of the Navy Ministry from June 5 to June 12 for a week. Attendees include Chief of the Naval General Staff, Prince Fushimi, Navy Minister Nagano, Vice Minister Hasegawa, Vice Chief of the Naval General Staff Shimada, Director of the Naval Affairs Bureau Toyota, and other related personnel, Chief of Staff of the Combined Fleet Nomura, and chiefs of staff. At the beginning of the first day of the meeting, Prince Fushimi and Navy Minister Nagano gave instructions, and then proceeded with the agenda. The Navy believes that the United Kingdom has requested to increase the reservation for the abolition of 40,000 tons of destroyers based on the London Treaty, and is also trying to strengthen its peacetime military strength. The United States is also compiling its unprecedentedly large naval budget and has already started implementing it. In view of the current international situation, it is inevitable to implement a new naval replenishment plan from the next fiscal year. Therefore, this year's Chief of Staff meeting is the highest policy of the Japanese Navy to cope with the treaty-free state after 1937. (30th Domei News Agency)</p>

<p>Shantou Correspondence: Japan's southward policy takes Taiwan as its center of operations. The Taiwanese press has taken advantage of this opportunity to organize a "South China Inspection Group." On the 16th of this month, they departed from Keelung on the Changsha Maru. On the 17th, they arrived in Fuzhou, and on the 19th, they arrived in Xiamen, visiting local newspapers and news agencies. On the 21st, they came to Shantou from Xiamen on the Fujian Maru. In advance, the Japanese Consul stationed in Shantou sent a letter to the municipal government, which was forwarded to the Shantou Press Association and the Reporters Association, explaining the purpose of the group's visit to Shantou. At 8:00 AM on the 22nd, when the group arrived in Shantou, the Japanese Consulate sent Secretary Kokuro and Taiwan Bank Manager Umezawa Shoichi to welcome them on the ship. After landing, they first went to the Japanese Consulate to rest. The head of the group is Hashiguchi Masayuki, Taipei branch of the Tainan Shinpo. The members are Matsuda Shoichi, reporter of the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun Taipei branch. Iwasawa Keizo, editing bureau of the Taiwan Nichinichi Shimbun. Kusakabe Kameo, reporter of the Domei News Agency Taipei branch. Lin Kuirong, reporter of the Taiwan Shinminpo. Yu Howei and others from the Taiwan Shinbun. After resting, they took cars to tour the city. At 10:00 AM, they visited Mayor Chen Tongchang. At 10:30 AM, they visited the Shantou Reporters Association, where they were treated with refreshments. All reporters and directors of the association were present. Secretary Kokuro introduced the group to the reporters and directors, and then they took their seats. The Reporters Association delivered a welcoming speech, which mainly said: "The Japanese press is dominated by capitalism and has become a mouthpiece for a very small number of people. It cannot represent the Japanese public in speaking fairly. For example, Otani Kozui's 'Longitudinal and Latitudinal Theory' refers to China as a bandit country and Chinese people as bandits, wantonly insulting them. Also, Councilor Mikami of the Chamber of Peers said that the national title of the Republic of China is detrimental to Japan's dignity and wants to change China to 'Shina.' Such insulting remarks and records of friendly nations are not corrected in the slightest, which is deeply regrettable to us. China and Japan have the same script and the same race. How should the two nations respect and support each other so that there will be hope for peace and friendship in the future of both countries?" Hashiguchi Masayuki then delivered a reply speech, which mainly said: "Taiwan and South China are very closely related geographically and historically. Politically, economically, and culturally, there is an inseparable relationship. The Taiwanese public opinion circles have not been to South China, and there is inevitably a separation from the people of South China. Therefore, we decided to organize an inspection group to visit Fujian and Guangdong and exchange views with the press in various places. As a result, we feel that China and Japan and Taiwan will definitely be able to achieve the goal of friendship. Our group has observed that the people and the press in various parts of South China have not yet worked to promote friendship between the two countries, or that colleagues in various parts of South China have not been to Japan and Taiwan and do not understand the situation of neighboring friendly countries. Your directors said that the Japanese press does not know the situation in your country. Then, the South China press also seems to not fully understand the situation in Japan. As a result, misunderstandings and suspicions arise, and they cannot understand each other and fail to understand the true meaning of friendship. When our group met with colleagues in Fuzhou and Xiamen, we proposed a suggestion, that is, 'Friendship between Taiwan and South China should start with the press in the two places and assume the responsibility for promoting it.' The press in Fuzhou and Xiamen all expressed their approval of this proposal. Today, we have come to Shantou and hope that colleagues in your area will also take on this responsibility. The people of Japan and Taiwan are working hard for peace. We hope that the Shantou press will also form an inspection group to go to Taiwan. Our colleagues will welcome you wholeheartedly." After Hashiguchi Masayuki finished speaking, all the reporters remained silent and did not express their opinions. Therefore, this tea party was carried out by the Reporters Association under the orders of the municipal government. The group took a ship to Hong Kong on the 22nd. According to Hashiguchi, the proposal made by the Shantou reporters not to insult the Chinese nation too much, causing the Chinese people to feel stimulated, is very difficult to handle, and he expressed great sympathy for this point. After the group arrived in Hong Kong on the 23rd, they took an express train to Guangzhou in the morning and are scheduled to return to Hong Kong on the 25th, to Macao on the 26th, and to Keelung on the Fujian Maru on the 28th. This group can be regarded as the vanguard of Japan's southward policy, using cultural cooperation as a banner and making both soft and hard actions, which is worthy of attention. (24th)</p>

<p>Related to Northwest Transportation, an Overview of Important Construction Projects</p>
<p>Lanzhou Correspondence: Yu Xuezhong, Chairman of the Gansu Provincial Government, is actively carrying out construction projects in Gansu Province. The following is a record of recent efforts:</p>
<p>Measurement of the Route of the Gansu-Xinjiang Highway</p>
<p>The Gansu-Xinjiang Highway is extremely important for Northwest transportation. Yu Xuezhong, Chairman of the Gansu Provincial Government, once telegraphed the Economic Commission, requesting it to dispatch a survey team to the west to carry out surveying in order to start construction. Although the survey team, led by Captain Liu Rusong, has arrived in Gansu and started work, it has only surveyed the first section to Wuwei. The Commission did not plan to survey the second section from Wuwei to Xingxing Gorge. Therefore, the survey team plans to stop heading west after surveying the first section. The provincial government believes that now is the time to develop the Northwest, and the main road of Gansu and Xinjiang should be opened up to facilitate transportation. Therefore, it specifically telegraphed the Economic Commission to order the team or form another survey team to continue surveying the second section in order to complete the entire project and facilitate construction. However, the Economic Commission replied that the province's construction plan for the road must wait until after a decision is made before dispatching a team to the west again. The province also replied that it had financial difficulties and was unable to build it. After repeated telegrams and discussions, the Economic Commission has telegraphed and approved that the minimum required project cost of 902,111 yuan for the Lanzhou-Suonan section will be included in the budget for the 25th year. However, it is not yet known how much will be allocated and borrowed. Therefore, the construction plan for the road must depend on the amount of funds approved for allocation and borrowing before a decision can be made. It is reported that a telegram has been sent again requesting the dispatch of a team to continue surveying as soon as possible and to allocate funds early to facilitate construction.</p>

<p>The counties of Dingxi and Longxi in Gansu Province have not yet built highways, which makes transportation in the two counties very inconvenient. In order to develop highway transportation and form a highway network, the provincial government has decided to build highways there to connect the traffic on each road. The county magistrates of Dingxi and Longxi have been ordered to first carry out construction within their capabilities. The road is planned to pass through Dingxi, Anyi, Thirty Mile Shop, and reach the boundary of Longxi County.</p>

<p>The Yellow River Iron Bridge in Gansu Province has long been loose and extremely dangerous and urgently needs repair. The provincial government had previously ordered the Purchasing Committee to purchase the necessary timber to start repairs. It is now learned that the Purchasing Committee has purchased all the various types of timber needed and is having carpenters manufacture the necessary planks. Yesterday, it sent technicians to survey the bridge and guide the carpenters in preparing materials. It was decided to start repairs on June 1. The original wooden planks on the bridge will be dismantled and replaced with new planks. The entire project is expected to be completed by the end of June.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Bizarre Disappearance Cases <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>One in a Beijing-Baotou train, one at Huangcun Station</p>
<p>Beijing Correspondence: When the Beijing-Baotou train arrived in Beijing on the morning of the 29th, a private car with license plate number 984 was parked outside the Beijing East Station in Qianmen. Then, a certain foreigner and a woman walked out of the first-class carriage number 141 of the Beijing-Baotou train, called the passenger接客者 in the car, and then took away the tea boy Wei Xun from carriage number 141. Someone asked the reason. According to the woman, Wei had behaved impolitely. It is heard that car number 984 is owned by a major general. Also, the ticket seller Chen at Huangcun Station on the Beining Railway also suddenly disappeared while selling tickets on the same morning. There has been no news of him until late at night. After this incident occurred, it caused unease among the general public.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Station Porters and Rickshaw Pullers Refuse to Carry Goods. Anti-Smuggling Inspection Office Established. Smuggled Goods Flowing into Jinan <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: There are more and more smuggled goods in North China. Shandong is close to Beijing and Tianjin, and the Jinpu Railway runs through it. Tax-evading goods are openly flowing in. After arriving in Jinan, they are distributed to southern and eastern Shandong. There are many types of smuggled goods, the largest being rayon and cigarette paper. The No. 22 express train at 8:07 PM every night and the No. 305 express train arriving in Jinan at 9:00 AM every morning both carry these smuggled goods. The No. 305 express train carries the most. The third-class carriages behind the locomotive are almost entirely filled with smuggled goods. Passengers with tickets have nowhere to sit and sometimes even encroach into the second-class carriages. Smugglers also send people to escort the goods, and no one dares to ask along the way, which is a strange phenomenon. Every time they arrive in Jinan, they unload at most seven or eight hundred packages (all packed in sacks). Now there is a trend of continuous increase. The station porters at Jinpu Station refuse to load and unload, and the rickshaw pullers outside the station also refuse to transport the goods. The smugglers therefore send their own people to load and unload the goods. After leaving the station, they forcibly grab vehicles to transport them, using the Da Jin Tai and Xinmin Inns as warehouses and then transship them to other places. Many factories in Zhoucun weave ramie silk, so rayon is transported to Zhoucun the most. The central government is determined to prevent smuggling. In addition to announcing the Provisional Regulations on Punishing Tax Evasion, the Ministry of Finance has also organized a General Inspection Office for the Prevention of Smuggling. For railways, a General Inspection Office for the Prevention of Smuggling by Rail has been established. The director is Ansell, a Briton, stationed in Tianjin. The deputy director is Li Tonghua, stationed in Jinan. Inspection offices have been established on the Jinpu Railway, and the heads of each office have also been appointed, including Lin Leming in Pukou, Cao Zhen in Bengbu, Wang Zuomin in Xuzhou, Li Baotian in Gunzhou, and Yang Shuren in Dezhou. In Jinan, there are also Inspection Director Ye Guochun and Inspection Captains Wang Chunlei and Cai Wankuang. They departed from Beijing by train on the 28th and got off along the way to start preparations. On the 29th, Li Tonghua visited Chairman Han Fuqu in the provincial government, verbally explaining the situation of smuggling and the prevention measures and requesting assistance. Han agreed to order the military police to assist at any time. (30th)</p>
<h3 id="e55">Fuzhou to Establish Committee. Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, Jianou, and Yanping Will Each Establish Municipal Offices <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Among the bustling commercial ports in Fujian, Fuzhou and Xiamen are the most prominent. Zhangzhou and Quanzhou are second, and Jianou is third. Xiamen has already established a municipal government. The idea of establishing a municipal government in Fuzhou was mentioned when Yang Shuzhuang and Jiang Guangnai were chairmen of the province, but it did not materialize due to changes in the political situation. Recently, the provincial government believes that Fuzhou's local area is developing rapidly, the population has exceeded 300,000, and local revenue reaches more than 200,000 yuan per month. However, there is no unified organization to oversee all administrative and facility matters, which causes many difficulties in governance. For example, in terms of finance, the collection of taxes belongs to the Finance Department and the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau. In terms of education, primary and secondary schools belong to the Education Department and the Minhou County Government. The division of power is diverse and inconvenient. Therefore, it was decided that before the establishment of the Fuzhou Municipal Government in the 25th year, a Fuzhou Municipal Committee will be established first, divided into Finance, Public Works, Education, and Public Security bureaus. The number of committee members will be five to seven, appointed by the provincial government, with one person as the chairman of the committee and four people concurrently serving as bureau chiefs. The current Director of the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau, Li Jinde, is the most likely candidate for the chairman position. The provincial government is actively preparing for this matter in order to establish it in the short term. In addition, it is planned to establish a municipal office in each of Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, Jianou, and Yanping to handle local public works and sanitation matters. (May 27)</p>

<h3 id="e58">Kunshan Small West Gate Businesses Strike <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Chen Deming, a shop assistant at Wang Taisen South Goods Store outside the Small West Gate in this county, saw police officer Shen Xijun from the responsible public security police station approaching with a piece of paper at around 10:00 AM on the 30th. Chen immediately called him "dwarf." The police officer was furious and slapped Chen in the face. This caused dissatisfaction among nearby merchants and residents, who questioned him and created a fierce commotion. They also escorted Officer Shen to the police station to report, but there were no results, which caused extreme anger. In an instant, all the stores on Small West Gate Street closed their doors and went on strike. They also sent representatives to report to the county chamber of commerce to request negotiations. The chamber sent personnel to earnestly persuade the merchants, and they resumed business at around 2:00 PM in the afternoon. On the afternoon of the 29th of last month, the third police sub-station of the Justice Public Security Bureau of this county dispatched armed police to various places to search for bandits. When they passed through Xiaogangkou in Zhuodun Township, they saw a boat with suspicious behavior and ordered it to stop, but it ignored them. After firing a shot, it finally docked. They went forward to inspect and found the cabin full of smuggled salt, totaling fifty packages, each weighing more than sixty catties. The people and the goods were transferred to the county bureau and sent to the judiciary for interrogation. The Fresh Meat Industry Association of Wuxian County stated that since the industry has already paid slaughter tax and business tax, it is double taxation on one item, and merchants are unable to bear the burden. It has submitted a request to the provincial government to exempt slaughter tax or business tax to reduce the burden. It received a reply stating that the request was not approved. It is currently continuing to petition and strive for exemption. According to people in the industry, if the goal cannot be achieved, they will unite the meat industries in various counties, send representatives to Beijing to petition.</p>

<p>Zhang Xinru, owner of Zhang Sen Tai Hotel in Yue Wang Market Town in this county, claimed that business was slow and he was unable to bear the original assessed business tax amount. He requested the collection officer sent by the bureau to reclassify him as Grade D, but no agreement has been reached, resulting in unpaid taxes of more than twenty yuan. Wu Gengyang, Director of the Business Tax Bureau, believed that the store had been pending for a long time, which affected the budget. Therefore, on the morning of May 29, he personally led several police officers to Yue Wang Market. After arriving at the 公所, he ordered the two collection officers, Zhu and Xu, to bring Zheng Jing Ru to talk. Later, the officers and Zheng Xinru and his son had a conflict. Police officer Ma Yongquan first slapped Zhang's son, Xinghe, and then dragged Zhang Xinru out, causing dissatisfaction among the spectators and inciting a town-wide strike. Jin and others, who had influence in the town, gathered merchants and residents to hold a meeting at the Guan Di Temple. They resolved five conditions and sent representatives to question Director Wu, and the situation was very tense.</p>

<p>Jin Weiyuan, who lives in a humble house under the Xiaomu Bridge outside the West Gate of this county, has one son and two daughters. The eldest son, Yuchun (nickname Genbao), is only ten years old. The elder daughter, Fenxiang, is six years old, and the youngest daughter, Lanxiang, is still in swaddling clothes. The family of several people all depends on Jin alone to pull a rickshaw for a living. His son, Yuchun, is studying in a nearby private school and is lively and clever. The couple love him like a pearl in their palm. He had a silver ring purchased in Huzhou around his neck, silver bracelets on both hands and feet, and silver earrings in his ears. Unexpectedly, he suffered a murderous disaster because of these silver items. On the evening of the 28th of last month, at around 8:00 PM, Yuchun went out to play. Unexpectedly, he had not returned home by midnight. Jin and his wife were extremely anxious and searched everywhere, but there was no trace. The next day, he still did not return home. Knowing that something had happened, they sent more than a hundred people to search separately, but there was still no news. On the 30th, Ji, the wife of Wang Ronggen, who lives in a humble house in Shuichewan, Kaiyuan Road, went to plant pumpkin seedlings in Ding Jinkui's mulberry field nearby. She caught sight of a child's corpse in a wheat field ditch. He was wearing a red plaid cloth shirt and pants and was extremely frightened and cried for help. Nearby residents gathered upon hearing the sound. The child was actually Jin Yuchun, who had been missing for several days. Lin Di, Ji's daughter, ran to inform Jin Weiyuan to identify the body, which was indeed his son. Jin's wife, Zhang, also rushed to the scene upon hearing the news and cried bitterly while stroking the body. However, the neck ring and silver bracelets that Yuchun was wearing were gone. There was a nail hole under the left nostril of his face, and blood flowed all over his face. There were also more than a dozen nail holes on his left and right arms and legs, and his whole body was covered in mud. His death was extremely tragic. The head of the district then reported to the first police station of the fourth public security bureau under his jurisdiction, who sent police to guard the scene. At the same time, Chen Zizhao, the chief of the 27th block, reported to the prosecutor's office of the local court. In the afternoon, Prosecutor Shen drove to the scene for an autopsy with forensic officer Shen, who confirmed that he had been injured and stabbed to death with nails. He then ordered the father of the corpse, Jin Weiyuan, to prepare a coffin and bury the body, pending arrest and prosecution of the murderer.</p>

<p>The Silk Industry Association of this county held a membership meeting at the county chamber of commerce at 2:00 PM on the 31st to discuss cocoon prices and opening dates, as well as requesting police protection. More than 200 representatives from various silk shops attended. The meeting was chaired by Hua Shaochun. After discussing the various proposals, it was resolved: 1. The price of improved cocoons is 30 yuan per picul. Native species and year-old foreign species will be priced at 21 yuan per picul as a standard. The opening date for buying cocoons, whether early or late, will be June 6.</p>

<p>The Wuxi Silk Cocoon Industry Association has been granted permission by the provincial government to open silk cocoon kilns, totaling 2,690. The association immediately notified the various silk shops to begin registration on the 27th. As of the 30th, 3,364 single kilns had registered, exceeding the original quota. However, according to last year's precedents, the proportion of species this year does require some flexibility. The association has specifically requested the Sericulture Model Zone to request the provincial government to consider making changes in order to take both sides into account. The Model Zone also discovered that in the southern townships, silk shops with four or fewer kilns that were sealed by the zone last year have this year opened kilns for private silk production under the name of cooperative baking, and there are also private scales for private collection. Because they violated the third provision of the registration, personnel were sent to strictly investigate. Once discovered, all the dried cocoons collected will be confiscated.</p>

<p>Gao Dexiang, a resident near Nanyang Town in the eastern township of Xiaoshan, has a fairly well-off family and operates a silk farm, raising silkworms in more than 20 compartments. The silkworms have already been transferred to the cocoons. Due to the continuous wind and rain in recent days, the temperature is low, and the silkworms are cold. On the morning of the 28th, a widow next door, whose silkworms were also transferred to the cocoons, used hot charcoal in a pot to bake the silkworms because she was old and deaf and blind. Due to a moment of carelessness, the flames caught the thatched house. In an instant, the fire shot straight through the roof. Neighbors bravely tried to put out the fire, but it was too late to extinguish it, causing it to spread to a total of seven families, including the neighbors to the west, Dexiang, destroying more than 20 thatched houses, more than a thousand catties of silk cocoons, and household sundries.

This has caused panic for both the people's food and production. The fresh bamboo shoots are rotting, affecting the livelihoods of tens of thousands of people. Yesterday, the industry representatives sent a joint telegram to the central government, appealing for a way to provide relief in order to alleviate the people's suffering.</p>

<p>Beating to Death of Bandit Jia Guizhang, Family Background Already Verified</p>
<p>The family has thousands of acres of fertile land and two mountain tops; Loss of life due to associating with bad friends and coming to Shanghai to play;</p>
<p>Cao Xiangtai Cotton Cloth Shop at No. 276 of Avenue Dubail was broken into by two armed robbers at 8 p.m. on the 5th of last month, who plundered and escaped.  They were pursued by Chinese Constable No. 824 of the French Concession Police to Yuegui Lane on Shilu (Stone Road) in the Public Concession.  Because the bandit opened fire to resist arrest, Jia Guizhang, a native of Shandong, was beaten to death.  Liu Yonghua, a bandit from Shandong, was captured alive by Chinese Constable No. 240.  The death of the bandit was reported to the Special No. 2 Court for verification, and the body was collected and buried by the Tongren Fuyu Shantang (charitable organization).  The bandit Liu was sent to the Special No. 2 Court for prosecution and sentenced to seven years of imprisonment.  The details of the case were reported in this newspaper.  Now, it is known that the bandit Jia Guizhang who was beaten to death was actually named Jia Kuizhang, and was 27 years old this year.  His ancestral home was in Shandong, but he grew up in Jurong.  His father came to Jurong early on and worked as a farmer.  He only had one son, Kuizhang.  Through years of management and savings, he now has thousands of acres of fertile land and two mountain tops, which can be described as a well-to-do family.  Kuizhang was already married, and his wife, Zhang, is 24 years old this year. It was decided by Liu Yonghua to go to Jurong to invite Jia Kuizhang to come to Shanghai to play.  They arrived in Shanghai for only three to five days. When their money ran out, Liu planned a robbery.  Because Jia was a member of the village self-defense corps and was familiar with marksmanship, he carried out the robbery with Liu.  Unexpectedly, he died a tragic death.  His parents are still alive at home. Now, Liu, the bandit, is informing his friends in prison, who in turn will inform Jia's family. Jia's wife, Zhang, came to Shanghai a few days ago, relying on relatives to invite fellow villagers to petition the Special No. 2 Court Procuratorate to claim the body.  With the approval of the prosecutor, the Tongren Fuyu Shantang was notified to send the coffin back and hand it over to Jia Zhang, the wife of the deceased, for claiming the body. After preparing clothing and coffin and re-embalming the body, they hired a boat to transport it back to Jurong for burial.</p>

It comes and goes. At about 2 p.m. yesterday, Amao walked to the Yu Rong Bridge in the town and jumped into the river to commit suicide. He was rescued by Jiangbei people on a boat, but he had already died.</p>

Also, the day before yesterday afternoon, in the Tangjiawan small vegetable market, Zhang Shiwu, a policeman from post No. 17, found an unidentified male corpse.

<p>Zhuang Jinlong's daughter, named Qiuying, who lives at No. 33 Zhenwu Road, Wusong, is 26 years old this year and possesses some beauty. She was first married to the son of Jiang Laosan on Dongsheng Road in the town. After Jiang's son died two years ago, Qiuying returned to her parents' home. Later, her father arranged for her to remarry Wu Qiuquan, a plasterer, as his wife. They lived together for three years. Recently, because Wu lost his job and was unemployed, Qiuying suddenly remarried Fan Jiagu, a fortune teller, at her parents' home. The night before last, the second husband, Wu Qiuquan, came to Wusong from Shanghai and went to Qiuying's home. However, he was prevented from entering by Qiuying and her father. The two sides then had a quarrel, and then they fought each other. The third husband, Fan Jiagu, also helped to assist, and as a result, Wu Qiuquan suffered three knife wounds on his arm. Then, the police officer arrived and took all the people to the Wusong Police Station. After questioning by officer Yang Haitian, because Qiuying had changed her husband three times and had committed a joint assault, he ordered the police to send Zhuang Jinlong, Zhuang Qiuying, Fan Jiagu, and Wu Qiuquan, all four, to the General Bureau for disposal.</p>

Her husband's name is Zhang Peisan, who now works at the restaurant guild in Yimiao. The day before yesterday morning, the couple suddenly had a slight dispute over a trivial matter. After her husband went out, Guan secretly swallowed opium to end her life. It was not until about 8 p.m. that her husband returned home and noticed it.

<p>In the jurisdiction of the Linping Road Police Station in Zhabei, at about 6 p.m. yesterday, near the abutment of Linping Road Bridge, a Jiangbei peddler selling broad beans suddenly had a conflict with a fellow peddler. The peddler was beaten to the ground and died. The perpetrator was later identified as Wang Dalong. The deceased was Li Guoyou, who lived in a shed near the Fenshui Temple. The cause was a dispute over business location.</p>
<p>The Court According to the Location</p>
<p>A prosecutor will be sent to the scene this morning to conduct an inspection to clarify the truth.</p>
<p>A Woman's Attempt to Chop Her Husband Failed</p>

<p>Chen, a Jiangbei woman residing at No. 58 Shuxiangli, Lane 125, Caishi Road in the French Concession, is 31 years old and earns a living as a domestic helper. At about 5 p.m. the day before yesterday, she returned home from work and demanded money from her husband, Wang Xiuqing. The couple had a quarrel, and Chen took a kitchen knife to chop her husband. At that time, Ding Xiaoheizi, a Jiangbei neighbor, 27 years old, who works as a tea house attendant, heard the shouting and rushed to mediate. Chen used the knife to stab Ding's left palm, causing a gush of blood. Ding went outside and called Chinese Constable No. 820, who took him to the French Police Station and transferred him to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Meanwhile, Detective Shen Guanxi was dispatched by the captain to arrest Wang Chen and bring her to justice. The next day, she was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Special No. 2 Court. The police department's lawyer, Chen Ming, presented the case and requested a postponement pending investigation after the victim's injury had healed.

The hospital reported the case to the Xin Division, which summoned the defendant Shen Yongnian, 42 years old, who runs a cooked rice shop and is from the same hometown as Ma. The cause was Ma Jinzhao's failure to pay for his meals, which led to a quarrel and then to the assault. After verifying the confession, the bureau officer ruled that the case was one of assault and sent it to the Public Security Bureau for disposal.</p>
<p>Night Soil Boatman Was Injured by Wharf Ruffians</p>
<p>Jin Nanhai and Jin Sansan, boatmen from Changzhou, make a living by farming in their hometown. They came to Shanghai at 10:30 a.m. yesterday and docked at the Pingliang Road Wharf in Yangshupu. They purchased dozens of loads of fertilizer from the night soil foreman of the Public Works Department to transport back to their hometown. While the Jin brothers were loading the fertilizer onto their boat, Wang Deshan, a ruffian from Anhui at the wharf, saw them and immediately instructed his accomplices to extort money, claiming that they had to hire porters and pay a certain fee per load. When the Jin brothers refused, the ruffians shouted and attacked, and more than a dozen helpers suddenly appeared and violently beat Jin Nanhai. As a result, his waist was broken by a bamboo pole, and he fell to the ground crying for help. Wang Deshan saw that he had caused a major disaster and tried to escape. Constable No. 50, an Indian policeman, heard the alarm and caught him, taking him to the Yangshupu Police Station. The report was clearly stated by the captain, who ordered him to be detained. The injured man was taken to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment. Yesterday, the lawyer of the Public Works Department, Zhang Shizhu, presented the case to the Third Criminal Court of the Special No. 1 Court, stating that the injured man was unable to attend the hearing and requested a postponement to arrest the accomplices. Constable No. 50, an Indian policeman, and Jin Sansan testified about the incident and questioned Wang Deshan. His confession was evasive. Judge Xiao ordered him to be returned to custody and adjourned the hearing pending the victim's recovery.</p>
<p>Blacksmith Bravely Arrested Thief and Was Rewarded</p>
<p>The Police Station Gave a Reward of Fifty Yuan</p>
<p>It was found that on March 30 this year, four bandits, one of whom was holding a handgun, broke into a house on Peng Road, intimidating the occupants into silence and arbitrarily searching for money and jewelry. When the bandits escaped, the occupants shouted for the police, and a blacksmith bravely pursued them, holding onto the bandit with the gun. The bandit struck him on the head with the butt of the gun, but the blacksmith, despite being injured in the head, held on and snatched the bandit's gun. When the beat policeman arrived in response to the alarm, he handed the bandit over to the police to be dealt with. The blacksmith's bravery and selflessness, and his courageous action, were truly commendable. The police station gave him a reward of fifty yuan to encourage him.</p>
<p>Bandits Intercepted Pedestrians on Qipu Road</p>
<p>The area around Gansu Road and Qipu Road has always been quiet and secluded, so general road bandits and petty thieves gather there, and robberies occur frequently. At about 5 a.m. yesterday, a certain Mr. A happened to pass by the road when he was intercepted by road bandits who threatened him with guns, ordering him to unbutton his clothes and let the bandits search him. Mr. A was unable to get away and had to do as he was told. As a result, more than 160 yuan in paper money hidden on his person was robbed. Although he reported the case to the police station afterward, requesting an investigation, it is difficult to predict whether he will be able to recover his property.</p>
<p>Stealing Coal and Committing Assault, Injuring a Weigher</p>
<p>Xie Henry's Injuries Are Very Serious</p>
<p>Chuan Akun Was Detained by the Bureau for Investigation</p>
<p>Xie Henry, 37 years old, from Guangdong, is a weigher at the Yihua Coal Company at No. 8 Jixiangli, Jiujiang Road, Hongkou.

Chuan Akun, the foreman of the Beipiao Company barge, instructed a laborer to privately steal coal, but Xie stopped him, which led to a conflict. More than 20 of the laborers surrounded Xie and started beating him. Xie was severely injured. The Public Security Bureau sent police to detain Chuan and others for investigation. Xie was taken to the hospital for treatment. After examination by the doctor, it was found that he had injuries to his chest and abdomen and was in critical condition.</p>
<p>Motorboats Are Not Allowed to Operate in Zhaojia Ditch</p>
<p>Zhaojia Ditch, the main irrigation artery in the Gaohang and Luhang districts in the upper reaches of Dajiangpu, Pudong, has gradually lost its effectiveness due to years of silting. The Public Works Bureau hired workers this spring to dredge it, which has greatly benefited farmland irrigation. However, the bureau, considering that the river channel is quite narrow, and that if motorboats are allowed to operate, the sediment on both sides of the river will inevitably be rolled into the riverbed by the waves due to the propulsion of the paddle wheels, leading to re-silting, the bureau has sent letters to the Public Utilities Bureau and the Chuansha County Government, banning the operation of motorboats, and also instructed the two Finance Bureaus to inform the boat tax office.</p>
<p>Zhang Nachuan Was Accused of Embezzlement</p>
<p>Zhang Nachuan, the former manager of the Hankou Industrial and Commercial Bank and now the deputy director of the Trust Bureau of the Central Bank, was recently accused of embezzlement by Yan Yichen and Yan Yuying, siblings from Yizheng, Jiangsu, with whom he had had friendly relations. They retained lawyer Zhou Zhengli to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The facts are that the Yan siblings had entrusted Zhang to keep 220 shares of stock in the names of Hankou Jiji Water and Electricity Company, Ankang Ji, Gaodao Ji, etc. At that time, Zhang was the manager of the Hankou Industrial and Commercial Bank. After Zhang took over the safekeeping, all the interest and dividends were remitted to Yan by Zhang. Later, the Industrial and Commercial Bank closed down, and Zhang joined the Central Trust Bureau. Recently, Yan discovered that the stock had been mortgaged by Zhang to the Bank of Communications, so he filed a lawsuit for embezzlement. The day before yesterday afternoon, Judge Chuan Lin summoned Zhang Nachuan in the Third Criminal Court for questioning. Zhang Nachuan did not appear. His wife appointed a lawyer to appear in court, saying that Zhang was currently in the capital on official business and would not be able to return to Shanghai until early June. She said that she had already telegraphed to inform him, so she asked for permission to postpone the hearing. Yan Yuying then briefly described the case. Judge Chuan then adjourned the hearing.</p>

<p>Letter Received</p>
<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p>Our company's Fulong steamship, which was carrying cargo from Qingdao back to Shanghai on the 27th of this month, arrived safely at the port at 3 p.m. the day before yesterday. Upon reading yesterday's third page, 12th edition of your newspaper, it was stated that the ship was stranded at Chenjiagang, Haizhou, on the 28th of this month, which is not in accordance with the facts. However, our company does have a ship stranded there, called Longshan, not Fulong, and the situation of the ship's stranding is extremely safe. As soon as the spring tide arrives today and tomorrow, it can go down the river smoothly. I hope that you will correct this mistake to prevent the spread of misinformation. Sincerely,</p>

<p>Ninth Jiangnan University Games Close</p>
<p>Fudan and Guanghua Universities Share Track and Field Championship</p>
<p>Jiangnan University Sports Association Ceases to Exist</p>
<p>Starting Next Session, Renamed Shanghai University Sports Association</p>
<p>The Ninth Jiangnan University Games continued at 2 p.m. the day before yesterday (30th). The program focused more on track events, but the overnight rain made the field slippery, which greatly affected the results. However, Qiu Guangxie and Zhang Jiakui were still able to break the conference records for high jump and triple jump, which was quite commendable. Zhang also equaled the conference record again in the 100-meter final, which was also acceptable. Fudan won the field event championship with 32 points, and Guanghua won the track event championship with 45 points. All events ended at about 5 p.m., and the closing ceremony was held in front of the command platform. Prizes were awarded by Madam Rong Qizhao. As usual, the Ninth Jiangnan University Annual Meeting was convened that evening to discuss various conference affairs for the next session. It was resolved that starting from the next session, the name will be changed to the Shanghai University Sports Association. All Jiangnan University championships this year, except for football, which has not yet ended, have been resolved, and the historic "Jiangnan University" Sports Association has come to an end.</p>

<p>Track and Field Championship</p>
<p>Field Event Championship</p>
<p>Past Champions</p>
<p>The Jiangnan University field and track championships began in March of the 15th year of the Republic of China. They were suspended for two years due to the National Revolutionary Army's arrival in Shanghai and the January 28th Shanghai War. Fudan won the field event championship in the first session. In the middle seven sessions, it was divided equally by Jinan and Central Universities. Fudan only regained the championship in this session. Fudan also won the track event championship in the first session. Subsequently, Jinan won four consecutive sessions. Guanghua won the sixth and seventh sessions. The Central University won the previous session. Guanghua has been working hard, and hired Gong Wanyu as the coach. Gong personally changes clothes and enters the field every afternoon, leading the athletes to practice various sports. As a result, their skills have greatly improved. Gong has also contributed to regaining the championship in this session.</p>

<p>Reading Club: A Chinese Grammarian Translated by Zhang Peilin (Translator's Note) The book "Kaiming English Grammar" was written by Mr. Lin Yutang. The first volume was published in 1930, and the second volume was published in 1932. This book broke the traditional format of old-fashioned grammar books, taking the classification of "ideas" as the main principle, and then seeking methods of expressing ideas, which is truly a revolution in the field of grammar. For several years, no one in domestic academic circles has written articles to criticize or introduce it. Now, in the fourth issue of the fifteenth volume of the quarterly "Studies in English Literature" edited by the Japan English Society, I saw an article "A Chinese Grammarina" by Professor Ichikawa Yoshiki of Tokyo Imperial University, praising this book and recommending it to Japanese students. I have translated the article as follows:</p>
<p>In 1931, when the University of Paris in France held the 400th anniversary celebration, I represented Tokyo Imperial University at the meeting. One of the representatives was a Chinese man named Lin Yutang, who represented the Academia Sinica. We met at various gatherings, but did not have the opportunity to talk. Later, when I learned what kind of person he was, I deeply regretted not talking to him at the time. Once at a meeting, forty representatives from all over the world each gave a few minutes of speech. Only his speech was the most readily available. His French was very fluent and he spoke very well.</p>
<p>In the second half of that year, I went to Copenhagen to visit Dr. Jespersen (a Danish scholar, an authority on contemporary grammar, whose works include "Philosophy of Grammar," "Growth and Structure of English Grammar," and "Modern English Grammar," all of which are extremely popular. Among them, "Philosophy of Grammar" is considered an epoch-making work. - Translator). During the conversation, he casually told me that a Chinese scholar had visited him not long ago, and that person was the author of "Kaiming English Grammar." He also took out the book and showed it to me, saying it was extremely interesting. At this time, I realized that the Chinese representative I had often met before without exchanging a word was actually a kindred spirit. After I returned to Japan, Jespersen's "Essentials of English Grammar" was published. On page 212, I saw a sentence that seemed to be quoted from "Kaiming English Grammar," which is "English commonsense has triumphed over grammatical nonesnce."</p>
<p>So I wanted to buy this book to read it even more. Recently, thanks to the kindness of a friend in Shanghai, I bought it. I also heard that Dr. Lin and the famous writer Lu Xun, who wrote "The True Story of Ah Q," are in the same group. He recently wrote a book called "My Country and My People," which is said to be the best book written by a Chinese about his own country.</p>
<p>I have already said a lot about the author above. Now let's talk about his "Kaiming English Grammar." This book is indeed worthy of attention. Its explanation of English grammar does not follow the old-fashioned grammar textbook method of defining many definitions and rules. Instead, it classifies all the grammatical tools of expression according to ideas or images, and then studies how to express these ideas in English. The author's debt to Jespersen's "Philosophy of Grammar" can be seen throughout the book, but his method of argumentation is original, and his English is also inexhaustible, not falling into the stereotype of ordinary grammar books. In terms of the nature of this subject, this is a very big feature. When the author talks about idea grammar, he compares the similarities and differences between Chinese and English expressions, and the comparison is very appropriate. This should have been the case, and it must be very beneficial to Chinese students who want to acquire the ability to use English effectively. This book was originally intended as a textbook for high school or for self-study, but if teachers and students in our advanced schools (i.e., the preparatory course of Japanese universities - translator) need an advanced English grammar book that is above the textbooks of ordinary schools, I dare to highly recommend it to them. We can understand most of the Chinese part, and it can also increase our interest.</p>
<p>Due to space limitations, it is not convenient to discuss each chapter one by one, but chapters such as "Science of Expression," "Modification," "Determination," "Modification," "Aspects of Action," "Facts and Fancy," "Relationships," and "Economy of Expression" are enough to show that this book is different from the compilation of ordinary grammar. Indeed, every chapter and every page provide something interesting that can make the reader feel happy. Because it is based on scientific and psychological principles, it does not have any scholarly air at all, and the examples and exercises used to illustrate modern customary law are very rich. Below is a quote from the author's English to give a glimpse:</p>
<p>"The power of expression can be trained only by learning expressive, everchanging idioms, and not by putting on the grammatical straitjacket. Grammar as the science of expression should be more subtle and less rigid; it should address itself more to the speaker's intentions and less to the rules and delinitions. It should be more concrete and wallow less in the terms of Latin origin. It should also be more positive and less less like a criminal code."</p>
<p>"Only by learning those idioms that are good at expressing meaning and are constantly changing can the power of expression be cultivated. It is definitely not successful by putting on the stiff jacket of grammar. Since grammar is the science of expression, it should be unpredictable and not unbreakable; it should communicate more with the speaker's will and less with rules and definitions. Grammar should be concrete and should not specialize in rolling around in the words of Latin origin. It should also be positive and should not be like criminal law."</p>
<p>This book is written in this tone from beginning to end. I recall that the author had such a speech in Paris, so it is no wonder that this book in front of us is so rich in suggestive material. In short, I think this book is a very good contribution of the Chinese academic community to the study of English, and it should also be welcomed by Japanese English scholars. In Japan, English grammar books are either too scholarly or too stale: one makes people respect ghosts and gods and stay away from them, and the other makes people discard them like worn-out shoes. However, Dr. Lin's book is moderate. The number of students in our country who want to develop the English way of thinking and express ideas in English regardless of grammatical rules is increasing day by day, so this book should be solemnly recommended to them for reading.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Confession of the Author of "Insect Anecdotes" Tao Bingzhen <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, due to the relationship of my academic discipline, I have bought several insect books to read. In addition to giving me applied knowledge, these books also brought an extra gift; that is, they often make me recall my childhood.</p>
<p>In childhood, when I still retained some of the habits of primitive people, because I had more opportunities to get close to nature, I often encountered various strange phenomena that even my parents and brothers could not answer. These doubts were deeply buried in my mind, and after ten, twenty, or thirty years, when I occasionally found correct and reasonable explanations in these books, I not only exclaimed "So that's how it is," but also the scenes of my childhood reappeared before my eyes, and a kind of pleasure of "turning over thousands of mountains and streams, and looking back" arose in my heart. The desire to spread this pleasure, like the ripples caused by throwing a stone into the water, gradually, is the driving force that prompted me to steal time from my busy schedule to write this small book.</p>
<p>The insects mentioned in the book are all easy to see in daily life; there are a total of fourteen kinds, arranged according to the seasons: the first are bees, honeybees, and butterflies that come out when all the flowers are blooming; then there are cicadas, fireflies, mosquitoes, and flies that come to comfort or disturb people in the summer when "long days seem like years"; after that, there are autumn insects that sing lowly in front of the steps and walk across the grass, dragonflies, crickets, locusts, mantises, and longhorn beetles; as for the cold winter in the north wind, most of the insects have died or hibernated, and I can't find the seasonal species; therefore, I attached fleas and ants, which are almost active all year round, to the end.</p>
<p>Since they are common species, then their shapes and habits are of course generally known; they are also recorded in ordinary books; therefore, this book mainly focuses on detailed descriptions of several wonderful characteristics.</p>
<p>Science originally belongs to the realm of knowledge, and it is easy to succeed in writing static descriptions; but in order to increase the interest of readers, this book uses dynamic narrative methods as much as possible. For example, on page sixty-two, the situation of Lis stalking cicadas is recorded:</p>
<p>"...Cicadas, enduring the heat, play symphonies all day long, and always want to rest at night; however, during this rest time, they still have to be disturbed by others repeatedly. Sometimes a short and sharp wail leaks out from the dense shade, which shows that they have encountered the attack of grasshoppers who are enthusiastically hunting at night. After the grasshopper pounces on the cicada, it first opens a hole in its abdomen and pulls out the things in its stomach. After eating all kinds of musical instruments, it kills the singer..."</p>
<p>"If you don't study the Erya well, you will recognize Peng as a crab." People who use less effort in taxonomy often make the joke of "putting Zhang's hat on Li's head." Because this book is a general reading material, it will only talk about a few important ones. For example, in the cricket item, the characteristics of crickets, oil gourds, triangle crickets, high-cheeked crickets, Italian crickets, etc., are explained one by one. At the same time, considerable attention is also paid to different names. For example, there is the following section on page one hundred and seventeen:</p>
<p>"Crickets not only have many different species, but even ordinary crickets have many different names due to dialect relations: like Qiong, is an early name; because they want to sing in a low voice, they are called Yinqiong. They are most enthusiastic in late autumn, as if urging people to hurry up and weave cloth to prepare winter clothes; therefore, they are also called CuZhi and QuZhi. The proverb says: 'CuZhi sings, lazy women are surprised.' So Jinan, Shandong, calls him Lazy Woman (see GuJinZhu), and Long Xiangzi of the Han Dynasty, whose name is Qiong, does not want to say the homophone Qiong, so he calls him Qiufeng; this is a different name added for personal convenience (see QingYiLu). In addition, there are also special names such as Wangsun (see Lu Ji's ShiShu), TouJi (see PiYa), and ShaTing Tribe (see QingYiLu)."</p>
<p>Literary works describing the characteristics of insects are also selectively quoted. For example, on page eighty-six, a section is quoted from the humorous king Dongfang Shuo Chuan:</p>
<p>"Guo Sheren said: 'Guests come from the east, singing and walking. Not entering through the door, crossing my walls, playing in the courtyard. One person in the hall, hitting him Huan Huan, the dead are jostling, fighting and dying, the master is wounded. What is this thing?' Shuo said: 'Long beak and slender body, painting dead at night, fond of meat and hating lamps, touched by the palms and fingers. Your servant Shuo is foolish and calls it a mosquito. 'Sheren was at a loss for words and often took off his trousers.' - Dongfang Shuo Chuan.</p>
<p>On page one hundred and eighty-two, Materlinck's beautiful essay describing the aerial marriage of ants is quoted as follows:</p>
<p>"She must fly to a place where there are no birds to disturb her. She flies higher, and the mixed groups chasing from below are thinning and scattered. The weak, the disabled, the old, the underdeveloped, the malnourished, etc., are desperate and disappear in the air. Of the countless like clouds and mist, only the small groups with extraordinary energy remain. She makes one last effort, look! Those who are elected with incredible force are chasing her, catching her, and conquering her. They support each other with double wings, embracing each other and flying upwards, hovering and dancing in the relative love and heat."</p>
<p>The motivation and content outline of this book are roughly like this. If it does not make much contribution to young readers, that would be a real pity.</p>
<h3 id="e85">A Readable Book Chen Ruhui <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>I often hear people say: "The national crisis is so serious, we should no longer read literary books. It's too boring and will waste our ambition."</p>
<p>When we evaluate this statement, we can't help but have doubts: Are literary books really boring? In times of serious national crisis, will literature lose its unique value?</p>
<p>We can understand the person who said this, because perhaps the literary books he has come into contact with are indeed "boring" enough. "Popular writers" are indeed good at manipulating the wind, flowers, snow, moon, and romantic love themes. The stimulating power of these works printed in young people's minds may not be lacking, but what kind of reaction will occur because of this stimulation is worth considering. So some people will inevitably gossip about literature.</p>
<p>If all literary works are just a kind of pink anesthetic ointment, or a soft toffee that wastes the ambition of young people, then they can simply be expelled from the cultural world, especially now that it is a period of "national crisis so serious."</p>
<p>But this inference cannot be established; because in the garden of literature, there are never just flowers that intoxicate the soul. Many works have extremely high value. Not only are they not "boring," and not "wasting the ambition of young people," but they are precisely suitable for reading in times of national crisis. - When we witness the crisis of our country and don't know what to do, reading these works may make you decide to embark on a new path.</p>
<p>Everyone has read Daudet's "The Last Lesson," right? That child from Alsace, that old French teacher Mr. Hamel, slipped from Daudet's pen to our minds one by one? They imprinted an unforgettable impression, and a kind of patriotic enthusiasm, inspired by the last lesson, couldn't help but arise. Young readers are very eager to be able to read similar good articles again, and even repeat the last lesson tirelessly; no, it is simply chewing and chewing every word.</p>
<p>Everyone has some experience of a kind of ardent need; and it is for this reason that I cannot but introduce "The Prisoner" to dear readers.</p>
<p>In the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, France was defeated; at that time, the indignation and sorrow of the entire French people were suppressed under the iron hooves of the Prussian army, but under the pens of several masters of naturalism - Daudet, Zola, and Maupassant, it was finally fully revealed. "The Last Lesson" is only one of them, while "The Prisoner" includes all the essence of the works of these three masters about the Franco-Prussian War.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that short stories have reached the point of perfection in the hands of Daudet, Zola, and Maupassant; the works they left behind are universally recognized by writers all over the world as the most valuable part of literary heritage. The fluency of the writing, the vividness of the description, and the skills of the structure of each story make people unable to but admire. And Mr. Li, who translated "The Prisoner," is the most familiar writer in French literature, especially in introducing the works of Maupassant and Zola. With such an author and such a translator, "The Prisoner" is indeed an extraordinary book.</p>
<p>In order to let readers better understand the content of "The Prisoner," I will briefly introduce it again:</p>
<p>"The Prisoner" collects Daudet's works, including "The Last Lesson" and seven other articles. Daudet is a writer extremely believed in by the French people, and almost every textbook in French primary and secondary schools selects his works; because what he writes is really good and really valuable.</p>
<p>In the article "The Little Spy," the author writes about the psychological struggle reflected by the guilty conscience of the protagonist, Little Stein, because he became a spy, which is truly incisive.</p>
<p>In "The Worthless Son," the author narrates an old blacksmith father who is willing to go to Africa to repay his son's military service obligations in order to evade his son's military service, which is written very profoundly:</p>
<p>"Child! Here are the anvils, here are the tools used,... all this is now in your charge.... Since you have sacrificed your honor for all this, then what you have gained is very, very little,... you are now the master here, and I, I will leave,... you owe France the obligation of five years of time, and I will now go to repay it for you."</p>
<p>In the article "The Ensign," he writes about an ensign who loves the regimental flag more than his own life:</p>
<p>"He was drunk, he was crazy, he pounced on the side of the Prussian officer, snatched his most beloved flag, and held it tightly; then he tried his best to raise it up, very high, very straight. While shouting, "Teach the flag!..." But at this time, his voice stopped in his throat. In that kind of slack air, in that kind of dead air that was so heavily pressing on the surrendered cities everywhere, all kinds of flags could not be unfurled, and nothing with the meaning of encouraging and inciting could live.... Finally, the old Hollows suddenly fell straight down."</p>
<p>"The Prisoner" collects five works by Maupassant. Mr. Mo is a genius in writing short stories. Even now, no writer can be found who can match him. In a duel, he writes about a Frenchman who refuses to be insulted by a Prussian officer and duels with the Prussian officer who insulted him. Although the writing is concise, the emotions are extraordinarily tense, making people feel as if they are witnessing it with their own eyes.</p>
<p>In the article "The Prisoner," the author cunningly satirizes the weakness and uselessness of the French National Guard. In order to make the seven German soldiers who had been imprisoned in the basement surrender, more than a hundred French soldiers had to use water pipes to pour water into the basement for three hours. Such a brave army was indeed praised and awarded badges by the government soon after. The whole article is written with subtle psychological techniques, making people feel funny, but also feeling the author's inner pain.</p>
<p>In "Miss Hum Hum," Mr. Mo describes how German officers cruelly and arbitrarily destroy the property of the French people:</p>
<p>"That first intruder, Miss Hum Hum, (the alias of a German officer) clapped her hands and laughed in front of a porcelain statue of the goddess Venus whose head had just been blown off. Each of them picked up some broken porcelain pieces, and they were very surprised by the strange jagged shape of these fragments, so they examined these new damages and discussed which damages were caused by the power of the previous explosion. And that lieutenant colonel appreciated the wreckage of the eight living rooms, which had been turned upside down by this 'Neron' bomb and covered with works of art, with a consistent parental kindness...."</p>
<p>Zola is the founder of French naturalism. People who have read French novels will be familiar with his name. He, Maupassant, and Flaubert are all famous literary giants of an era. "The Prisoner" collects only one of his novels, "The Battle of the Water Mill," but it is quite long. Among the thirteen articles in this book, this article has the most complex structure and the most delicate description. It narrates a young man who does not belong to French nationality, who participated in the "Battle of the Water Mill" for the sake of his lover - a French girl. As a result, he was captured and killed by the German army in front of his lover. The author's description of the protagonist's killing can really make people sob.</p>
<p>"A row of frightening gunshots exploded in her ears like thunder; this made her turn around to look immediately. It turned out that the officer had just muttered: 'Let's settle this matter first.' So he personally pushed Tao Minyi to the wall of a factory building, and then issued the order to fire. When Francoise turned around, Tao Minyi had already fallen to the ground. - He had been shot twelve bullets in the chest.</p>
<p>She did not cry, she was stunned there, her eyes became straight. Later, she walked to the bottom of the factory building and sat down a few steps away from Tao Minyi's body, she looked at him carefully; sometimes, her hand moved half-consciously."</p>
<p>In short, every article in "The Prisoner" is wonderful and tense, perhaps written by the author with blood and tears. The three great literary geniuses, watching their motherland being trampled on by the enemy, melted their full of grief and indignation into the lines of the text. Works with such origins are certainly not comparable to things written by ordinary people facing the wall in ordinary situations.</p>
<p>When we read these moving and tearful novels, we can imagine that the French people at that time were not just a nation that would be "calm." As the translator said: "It is by no means accidental that they were able to victoriously recover the lost land more than forty years after the Franco-Prussian War."</p>
<p>We certainly do not have the "Siege of × Jing," but the situation is not better than France in the era of the "Siege of Paris"; so it is natural for young people to read some anti-enemy novels.</p>
<p>"The Prisoner" is a literary work, but it is an anti-enemy novel. She can help promote our patriotic enthusiasm and encourage us to bravely step onto the front line of national struggle.</p>

<p>Economic Supplement: Prospects of the Agricultural Foundation Bureau Huang Tong</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>Agricultural panic has become a common phenomenon in the world in recent years. Chinese rural areas suffer from the exploitation of feudal remnants internally and the invasion of international capital externally. The collapse is so rapid, widespread and profound that it is beyond imagination!</p>
<p>Those who talk about rural relief in China have different views and different opinions. Some advocate "improving agricultural production technology," some advocate "adjusting the marketing of agricultural products," some advocate "circulating rural finance," and even more advocate "popularizing rural education and promoting rural autonomy." In short, it is nothing more than using public, public welfare, mutual assistance or other organizational forces under the existing social system to inject a "life-saving soup" into the dying rural areas.</p>
<p>This time, the Ministry of Industry plans to set up the Agricultural Foundation Bureau, intending to unite the government and the banking industry to invest in rural areas in a planned and systematic manner, with cooperative organizations as the backbone, to handle "circulating agricultural funds and adjusting agricultural products." From then on, the scattered and fragmented relief work will be brought into a unified and integrated path. Perhaps the remaining rural areas have the hope of recovery!</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>The Agricultural Foundation Bureau has many advantages. To list the major ones, there are about three points.</p>
<p>China's peasant economy has declined to the extreme. According to estimates by the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute, more than half of the farmers in the country are in debt. (1) If the total number of farm households in each province is estimated at 58,569,181 households, (2) then the number of responsible farm households should be more than 29 million households. Although there are no statistics available on how much each household owes, if 80 yuan is taken as the total amount of debt per household, (3) then the total debt owed by more than 29 million farm households should be more than 2.3 billion yuan. However, this only refers to the debts already owed by farm households; it is found that the country has more than 1.2 billion mu of cultivated land, (4) and if each mu is loaned 5 yuan for operating funds, it will require more than 6 billion yuan, which is a shocking number! Although there are no less than 20 so-called agricultural and agricultural-industrial banks in China, the total amount of paid-up capital is only more than 20 million yuan; (5) This spring, the Ministry of Finance specially approved the Central Farmers Bank to issue banknotes of 100 million yuan, stipulating that half of it should be used for land mortgage loans and rural loans; in addition to the rural loans of commercial banks, at most it will be about 100 million yuan; to cope with the need of more than 8.3 billion yuan (the total of clearing old debts and operating funds), it is really like "a drop in the bucket"!</p>
<p>Now the funds of the Agricultural Foundation Bureau are set at 60 million yuan, half of which is fixed capital, which is raised by the government, and half of which is combined capital, which is jointly paid by participating banks. In addition, there is an indefinite amount of circulating capital, which is given by the Agricultural Foundation Bureau in consultation with participating banks at the beginning of each year or at any time. The total amount of bank funds in the country is not necessary to discuss for the time being. Taking the 28 more reputable member banks in Shanghai as an example, the total amount of deposits in 1933 was more than 2.4 billion yuan, and various loans totaled more than 2.02 billion yuan. (6) The situation in the previous two years should be even better than this, so the abundant source of circulating funds can be imagined. What's more, in addition to the above funds, when necessary; the government may order the Agricultural Foundation Bureau to issue agricultural bonds, and the government shall be responsible for guaranteeing the principal and interest. Its financial strength is definitely not something that the existing so-called agricultural and agricultural-industrial banks can hope to compare with; this is its advantage.</p>
<p>In China, "agricultural products are cheap and agricultural supplies are expensive" has become a normal trend. The balance of payments between rural and urban areas is therefore constantly lost; coupled with the fact that politics has not been on track in recent years, and rural areas lack self-defense forces, the more affluent residents have moved to cities, resulting in the increasingly serious problem of "capital preference." Cities suffer from the lack of places to absorb surplus funds, while rural areas are impoverished, which is too much, and both sides are harmed! In the past, there have been moves to bring commercial capital into rural areas, but they are fragmented and small in amount; moreover, as a result of no control and no planning, they "choose the fat and devour it" and compete for profit with each other, so that the more urgent the need, the less people invest in terms of land, and the more difficult the livelihood, the less people care about in terms of people! Now the government comes out to make an overall plan, so that the national banks, under the command of the Agricultural Foundation Bureau, make a group-based rural loan, and the government guarantees the principal and interest to ensure its safety. From then on, the surplus funds accumulated in cities will flow into rural areas, and both will benefit; this is its advantage.</p>
<p>China's food has always been self-sufficient. In the early years of the Republic of China, there was still surplus grain for export to neighboring countries, but since recent years, it has gradually felt insufficient. A large amount of rice and wheat is imported every year. According to customs reports, food imports last year amounted to more than 195.91 million yuan, accounting for four-tenths of the total import surplus, which is really alarming! Examining the root cause, it is definitely not entirely due to "few births and many eaters"; otherwise, why did the provinces report good harvests in 1932 and 1933, but rice and wheat were still imported? It can be seen that the market organization of agricultural products is flawed and production and sales cannot be adjusted, which is a major reason. Now the Agricultural Foundation Bureau has set up a agricultural products department, engaged in the buying and selling of general agricultural products, in order to trade what is available and what is not, and to set up agricultural warehouses to regulate surplus and deficiency, and to participate in the formulation of agricultural product freight rates and tax rates, in order to reduce the "Cost of Marketing," then it will definitely make a major contribution to the national food policy: this is its advantage.</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>The advantages of the Agricultural Foundation Bureau are roughly as described above; but a closer examination of its content also reveals some shortcomings, which are listed separately below.</p>
<p>One of the shortcomings of the Agricultural Foundation Bureau lies in the undetermined system. The state should have a complete system for financial undertakings, classifying them into categories and doing their best, so as to achieve the effect of "connecting the meridians and collaterals and smoothing the blood flow." There are currently more than 190 banks in China, and more than 180 of them are engaged in ordinary business. The nature is not divided, and the business is becoming narrower and narrower. Moreover, due to the lack of proper business, they mostly use high interest rates to absorb deposits to fill up the funds for margin, foreign exchange, real estate, bonds, and commodity speculation, and disturbances occur in the market from time to time. Since the Ministry of Finance implemented the new currency policy, it has also sought to improve the entire financial system, intending to narrow and concentrate the existing banks according to their business scope, establish their nature, and separate them into eight types of banks: central, industrial, agricultural, commercial, real estate mortgage, savings, remittance, and industrial.</p>
<p>There are currently more than 20 so-called agricultural and agricultural-industrial banks in China, which are not only weak in financial strength, but also do not live up to their names. "Some are only working hard on banknote issuance. Some have transformed into commercial banks. They compete to engage in speculation; some have engaged in improper business; some are only provincial banks of a certain province, or municipal banks of a certain city; they have no connection with agriculture and no connection with industry." (8) It seems that only the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank can fulfill its responsibilities as an agricultural bank to some extent.</p>
<p>Such agricultural financial institutions that exist in name only must be rectified. It is found that the China Farmers Bank, since its reorganization from the various provincial agricultural banks, has a paid-up capital of 7 million yuan, and the rural loans it has handled have also reached 10 million yuan. Recently, the Ministry of Finance specially approved the issuance of 100 million yuan in banknotes, with 50 million yuan used for rural loans. Its financial strength has gradually become strong, and its branch offices will soon be popularized throughout the country. 53 branches have been established, and the rest are being actively added.</p>
<p>Now, according to the nature of the Agricultural Foundation Bureau, it is a combination of public and private cooperation, which is quite similar to the China Farmers Bank, which is jointly run by government and businessmen; its business content is also largely the same as the business of the China Farmers Bank. If it is practically possible, it is better to transfer the funds of the Agricultural Foundation Bureau to expand the China Farmers Bank, so that it can be changed into a sound and powerful institution specializing in medium-term or movable property credit, and then set up a central cooperative bank and a central land bank outside the China Farmers Bank to cope with short-term and long-term credit, and use the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry as the coordinating and competent authorities. In this way, we can not only avoid the establishment of financial institutions of the same nature competing with each other, so as to weaken their strength and increase expenses, but also enable agricultural finance to have an integrated and unified system, which is not a multiple win? Of course, if the Agricultural Foundation Bureau is a purely medium-term or movable property credit institution, and the China Farmers Bank is changed to an institution that operates long-term mortgage credit, as long as it is practically convenient, it is also feasible.</p>
<p>The second shortcoming of the Agricultural Foundation Bureau lies in the unclear organization. According to the outline of the Agricultural Foundation Bureau, it itself contains many contradictions. For example: 1. The mission of the Agricultural Foundation Bureau is to "circulate agricultural capital and adjust agricultural products." The former is mainly a financial undertaking, while the latter is close to administrative facilities. The two should cooperate but should not operate concurrently. Now merging them into one is tantamount to a financial institution concurrently handling agricultural administration, which inevitably has the suspicion of overlapping powers. 2. The funds of the Agricultural Foundation Bureau are divided into three types: fixed, combined, and circulating. Fixed funds seem to be government shares, combined funds are similar to commercial shares, and circulating funds are a type of bank loan: according to its nature, it is obviously a combination of public and private cooperation. But what is the purpose of the Agricultural Foundation Bureau, public welfare or profit-making? If the purpose is public welfare, then commercial banks are not charitable organizations. Since the government is eager to attract them to participate in investment with favorable conditions such as guaranteeing principal and interest, then the trend of the times will inevitably lead to "increasing profits" as its final destination. If the purpose is profit-making, then how will it choose between the rural loans of general commercial banks, and it will be difficult to achieve the purpose of "developing agriculture and helping farmers"!</p>
<p>The third shortcoming of the Agricultural Foundation Bureau lies in the high cost of loans. The loan resources of the Agricultural Foundation Bureau have three types: fixed, combined, and circulating. Fixed funds are allocated by the government, and combined and circulating funds are supplied by the banking industry. The essence of ordinary banks lies in "seeking profit with capital," and naturally hopes that the investment funds are safe and the interest is favorable. Now the Agricultural Foundation Bureau stipulates an annual interest rate of 8% for the combined funds of banks, and it must be slightly higher when lending to farmers. This annual interest rate of 8% may still have the risk of losses in terms of the loan cost of the banking industry, while in terms of the agricultural income of farmers, it has little practical benefit. The Central Agricultural Experiment Institute investigated the difficulties of cooperatives in various provinces and cities in borrowing money from outside, with cumbersome procedures accounting for 14%, difficult guarantees accounting for 2%, inconvenient transportation accounting for 10%, and too high interest rates accounting for 7%: this can be seen from this. If the Agricultural Foundation Bureau is a little careless and favors seeking benefits for the banking industry, then the so-called "agricultural loans" will only turn the urban bank capital into rural usury capital, and the so-called "agricultural marketing" will further increase the commercialization of agricultural production. As a result, it will only open up investment tails for urban finance. How can we talk about rescuing rural areas!</p>
<p>IV.</p>
<p>To sum up, although the Agricultural Foundation Bureau does contain some shortcomings, it is "better than nothing" when weighed against the actual situation of the financial world and rural areas in China today. We certainly do not want to nitpick and are willing to be optimistic about its success. However, we have already said that the root of the rural collapse lies in the invasion of international capital externally and the exploitation of feudal remnants internally. Therefore, externally, we must unite the strength of the entire nation to lift the shackles of imperialism, and internally, we must use strong means to reform the unreasonable rural production relations. Only then can the dying rural areas have the hope of true coexistence!</p>
<p>Land is the basic element of agricultural production. If we want to reform rural production relations, we should first solve the land problem, which no one will deny. The solution to the land problem depends on the assistance of land financial institutions. Therefore, the second annual meeting of the Chinese Land Policy Association resolved to implement the establishment of land surplus institutions as a major outline of the current land policy. In November last year, the Ministry of Finance announced the new currency system, mentioning the establishment of real estate mortgage loans. Subsequently, at the Fifth National Congress, the father passed the case of developing land economy and credit, instructing the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Interior to handle it. And the proposal to set up a land bank has also been seen in newspapers many times. It is a pity that "dense clouds do not rain." We do not know when the land bank we have been seeking will be realized? As for the real estate mortgage bank that is being prepared, it seems that urban real estate will be its business object; although the China Farmers Bank is ordered to handle land mortgage loans, the father is not an institution specializing in land credit, and it cannot be compared with the land bank we are talking about.</p>
<p>The rural loans handled by various banks in China today are mostly short-term in nature, and farmers only receive temporary circulation of funds, and there is still no way to eliminate their actual pain. The task of the Agricultural Foundation Bureau is nothing more than to further adjust the existing scale, and it is still far from the active rescue of the rural crisis. We deeply hope that the wise authorities will make a thorough plan for the entire agricultural financial system in addition to setting up the Agricultural Foundation Bureau, so as to strive for a bright future for the broken rural areas!</p>

<p>Actively Rebuilding for Twelve Years, Sufficient to Meet National Defense Needs</p>
<p>From Brest, France: The new naval academy building here was recently completed. President Lebrun personally presided over the ceremony today, and Naval Minister Pietri also attended, delivering a speech to all those present. He discussed France's naval reconstruction since the European War, stating, "During the European War, France lost over 130 warships and 10,000 officers and soldiers. We have actively rebuilt since the war, taking twelve years to reconstruct a navy that meets our national needs. The only regret is that the battleship component has not been fully replenished." Regarding this part, the government's shipbuilding plan includes four battleships with a total displacement of 125,000 tons. Once built, they will complement the existing "Lorraine" class (23,000 tons) battleships that have been renovated, forming an extremely excellent battleship fleet. By then, the unfinished work of the late Naval Minister Leygues can be completed, and the quality of the French Navy will be excellent, appropriately allocated, and powerful, serving as an example for other countries. In addition to this, the existing twenty light warships have been sent for repairs, and the aircraft carrier "Béarn" has also been renovated. The work of constructing battleships and renovating the existing ships complements each other. Pietri further explained that the naval authorities are now striving to improve the naval academies in Toulon (southern France) and Brest, the two original naval ports, in order to train officers. They are also establishing state-of-the-art naval bases in Toulon, Bizerte (in Tunisia, North Africa), and Mers-el-Kébir (in Algeria, North Africa), reorganizing coastal defenses to ensure completeness. Furthermore, the reserve of naval fuel has been doubled, and the oil is stored in underground pits, resembling oil mines, to avoid attacks and ensure exceptional safety. As for naval aircraft, their strength is also sufficient, and all new aircraft are comparable to those of other countries. Finally, Pietri stated that after the European War, the French Navy was exhausted, so it had to accept the restrictions stipulated by the Washington Naval Treaty. Now, this treaty will expire at the end of this year. In the future, France's shipbuilding plan will only be based on the reasonable needs of the country and will not be bound by any other restrictions." (Havas News Agency, 30th)</p>

<p>Fierce Battles Between Arabs and Military Police, Bombings Occurring Repeatedly</p>
<p>Jerusalem: Although the authorities in Palestine are making every effort to maintain peace, the chaos has not ended. Yesterday, even more serious clashes occurred throughout the territory between troops and the Arab population. When military police were searching for weapons in a village near Nablus (30 miles north of Jerusalem), they were fired upon by Arabs. The military police returned fire, killing one Arab and wounding two others. Last night, thousands of trees in Hadera and Tiberias were uprooted, crops in Balfour were destroyed, and several fires broke out in Haifa during heavy rain. It is now believed to be arson. A group of Arabs was pursued by police for ten miles in the hills between Jerusalem and Jericho. One armed Arab was captured after being wounded. A Jewish public bus was attacked by Arabs from both sides. Two hours later, when police were escorting a heavy truck carrying dead meat fertilizer to the same location, they were also heavily bombarded. Last night, two British soldiers were ambushed, one was wounded. The two were delivering bedding to Arab political prisoners. The situation in Ramleh, ten miles southeast of Jaffa, is very serious. The families of officers and soldiers of the Royal Air Force have been evacuated from the town. (Reuters, 31st)</p>
<p>Jerusalem: After two days of relative calm, many major incidents occurred again yesterday. As a result, the military police throughout Palestine are again wearing helmets on duty. Last night, a bomb exploded in the office of the Jaffa District Committee, damaging equipment and windows. Several bombs also exploded in Acre and its surroundings. A team of British police was patrolling the southern district of Jaffa in a car yesterday when they were suddenly fired upon by Arabs who had been lying in ambush. They narrowly escaped disaster. Bullets penetrated the car, but no one was hit. A team of Royal Scots Fusiliers was guarding a post near Jaffa when they were attacked by a crowd with stones. After repeated warnings, the crowd still did not disperse, so they opened fire, wounding two people. Sniping and bomb throwing incidents have been occurring repeatedly in Jaffa. The military police were forced to use machine guns to quell the unrest. A large group of Arabs fired at the soldiers patrolling the railway from both sides of the Ras al-Ein railway. After the soldiers returned fire, the crowd fled. An Arab in Haifa was seriously injured by a bomb. It is believed that the bomb exploded because he was carrying it carelessly. Several Arab and Jewish newspapers have been ordered to cease publication by the authorities for spreading false information. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Jerusalem: The Nablus Arab strike committee issued a declaration expressing strong disapproval of the riots and attacks on the police, saying that the committee does not approve of such incidents. The future seems slightly brighter. (Reuters, 31st)</p>
<p>Jerusalem: British aircraft arrived here today to scout the mountains near here and places where ambushes could occur. It is rumored that the military authorities are now considering bombing villages in the Nablus area to destroy the guerrilla tactics of the Arabs. (National News Agency, 29th)</p>

<p>(Paris) Although the factory occupation strike movement spread to several more factories in the Paris area today, the situation has greatly eased because several major factories have reached settlements with workers. It should be quiet within a few days. The workers occupying the factories are maintaining strict order, and no cases have occurred that require police intervention. At one point, more than 80,000 people were on strike. They have organized concerts and performed plays to pass the time. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The complete resolution of the metallurgical industry labor unrest is near. Labor and management in fifteen of the most important factories, including the Citroën automobile factory, have reached an agreement. The Citroën automobile factory is scheduled to resume operations after Pentecost. The agreement includes a 10% wage increase, one week of paid vacation per year, cancellation of overtime work, and recognition of the union's right to represent workers and sign work contracts with management. In addition, labor and management in several other metallurgical industry factories have not yet signed an agreement, and 10,000 of their workers are still on strike. The other factories are expected to follow the metallurgical industry's example and reach agreements within the next week. (Havas, 31st)</p>

<p>Unlikely to Win Championship This Time, Unemployed Worker Who Did Not Buy Ticket Turns Misfortune into Good Fortune</p>
<p>(London) Because the "Queen Mary" entered a heavy fog, it could only see 200 yards ahead, and the speed was halved this morning. The fog later became even thicker, and it was almost impossible to see anything. The speed was reduced again. Therefore, it is feared that this voyage will not be able to win the Atlantic speed championship. Captain Sir Edgar Britten and five others are on watch in the bridge. (Reuters, 31st)</p>
<p>(London) The "Queen Mary" traveled 747 miles between noon on Thursday and noon on Friday. The French postal ship "Normandie" traveled 744 miles in the same time. Therefore, the "Queen Mary" has broken the "Normandie's" record. The average speed is 29.88 knots. Captain Sir Edgar Britten is very satisfied with the ship's speed and is very pleased with the good weather. Sir Edgar said that we seafarers see the Atlantic for nine months in winter and three months in fog. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>(London) According to a Reuters correspondent on board the "Queen Mary," a stowaway who had not purchased a ticket was found in the engine room. He was extremely hungry. His name is Gardiner, 41 years old, and he is an unemployed worker from London. He has now been assigned to work as a cook to pay for his passage. He has turned misfortune into good fortune. Passengers on the ship are donating generously to help him. U.S. Ambassador to London Bingham is also a passenger and has promised to use his influence to prevent immigration officials from immediately deporting Gardiner. Americans predict that after Gardiner arrives in the United States, he will become a famous figure in the newspapers. According to Gardiner, he did not intentionally stow away on the Queen Mary. He was working as a ditch digger in Southampton when he suddenly decided to sneak into the stokehold of the "Queen Mary," without even having time to take off his clothes. (Reuters, 30th)</p>

<p>Impeded by the Johnson Act, This Matter Is Expected to Fail</p>
<p>(Paris) According to a report from a financial institution here today, the future left-wing government of France may borrow a huge sum of $1,000,000,000 from the United States to alleviate its financial difficulties. However, the key to this matter is whether France can acknowledge its war debts to the United States and maintain monetary stability. According to those familiar with the situation, this matter will certainly fail because France is currently talking about devaluing its currency. (National News Agency, 29th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Major financial institutions here today believe that the future new government of France may borrow $1,000,000,000 from the United States to solve France's currency problems. Observers say that although future Premier Blum wants to borrow, he may not succeed because the U.S. Johnson Act prohibits the United States from lending funds to countries that are delinquent in their debt payments. It is also recalled that Blum recently gave a speech to the American Club here, hinting that he intends to resolve the issue of French-American war debts. Therefore, the United States may require gold guarantees to prevent the devaluation of the franc and the overthrow of the gold standard. (National News Agency, 29th)</p>
