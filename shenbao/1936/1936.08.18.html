<h3 id="c9">英法成立不干涉恊定 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>近者西班牙內亂。異常嚴重。德意二國。于叛軍多方援助。法蘇二國。于馬德里政府。厚示同情。此地中海一隅之內亂。將擴大為汎歐洲之法西陣綫與反法西陣綫之鬥爭。為避免此人類之慘劇。法國政府乃有不千涉恊定之提出。主張各簽字國不得以各種軍火。軍用民用飛機及各種軍艦售予西班牙或西屬摩洛哥。英法兩國已在巴黎互換照會。果能獲得德意蘇聯葡萄牙四國政府應允參加。發生效力。則不但西班牙戰禍。不致延長。而對于鄰國內亂之不干涉。在國際習慣上。亦創一善例。裨益和平。非淺鮮也。</p>
<p>吾人就原則上論之。主權政府對于其國之人民土地。有絕對支配之權。政府之採取何種方式。任何鄰國。無置喙之權。如直接或間接干涉其國。不但非友善之舉動。抑亦國際法所不許也。軍火之接濟。以助長內亂。更于人道上為一罪惡。吾國自辛亥以還。歷屆內亂。無一無外國軍火商人為背景。接濟叛軍以軍火。或有政治之企圖。或純以營利為動機。其結果均足破壞統一。增加殘殺而擾亂和平。西班牙外交家馬達利加。論中國問題。曾痛切言曰。當歐美日本軍火商停止在中國活動之日。卽中國統一東亞和平之時。馬達利加所論于中國者。今竟適用于其本國矣。吾人就道德上法律上觀察。不干涉恊定。應受世界人士之擁護。而此恊定之原則。亦足以為將來國際關係準繩之一端也。</p>
<p>雖然。就技術上言之。不干涉恊定有許多困難問題。不易解决。國際公法尙在幼稚時期。過去習慣多不合人類之理想。如依習慣。則中立國家。對於交戰之兩方雖不能以國家及政府資格。有左袒任何交戰團體之行為。然中立國國民個人之行動。如示威游行。報章宣傳。捐欵投軍。中立國政府均無制止之義務。軍火貿易。如為私家之商務。亦非政府所宜禁。諸國立法。于此點雖已略有改進。然就英國而論。英政府尙無權禁止飛機之貿易也。况軍用品與非軍用品之區別至微。棉花鋼鐵。煤油橡皮。均軍用品之至要者。而通常不視為戰時之禁物。况西班牙之叛黨。尙未被認為交戰團體。許多國家。不覺負中立國之義務。卽協定成立。不加入協定者可大受商務上之利益。故協定之為各方所接受。尙待長時間之措商。能否因此一紙之書。而挽回危局。吾人未宜過作樂觀也。</p>

<p>美國一九三四年取消酒禁後、國會頒行酒稅律、凡屬酒類、須納統稅·印花稅、經營酒業者、須納牌照稅、中國藥酒前在美國禁酒期內、銷行甚廣、最近美國內地認中國藥酒、自本年六月一日起、其含酒成份在百分之二十四以上、須作强酒論、除繳納統稅·印花稅·牌照稅外、尙須繳納各種附稅（致負擔激增、無法與他酒競爭、勢將絕跡於美國市塲、茲分誌詳情於後、</p>
<p>銷美酒類</p>
<p>中國酒類在美國市塲行銷者有五茄皮·白糯酒·黑　酒·萊陽酒·冬瓜酒·木瓜酒·金橘酒·史國公三蒸酒·玫瑰酒·百齡酒·三鞭酒·參茸酒·蛤蚧酒·龍虎酒·百歲酒·鷄爪酒·虎骨鄉酒·衛酒·茵陳酒·橙花酒·等等、如五茄皮酒、上海每瓶僅售五角、而美現售美金二元八角、在禁酒時期、强酒淡酒、均在禁例、惟藥料酒祗須請領入口執照、卽可源源輸入、不在禁限、故過去除强酒·淡酒類·輸入較見减少外、其藥酒銷路則甚廣、自一九三四年取銷禁例、中國酒輸銷者為數尤巨、</p>
<p>納稅一斑</p>
<p>中國酒輸往美國、其納稅種類、（一）統稅係由製造商、或進口商繳納、凡屬强消、每標準加崙納美金二元、如屬淡酒、成份在百分之十四以下者、每加崙納印花稅美金一角、酒之成份在百分之十四上者、每加崙納印花稅美金二角、酒之成份在百分之二十以上者、每加崙納印花稅美金四角、在百分之二十四以上者、作强酒論納稅、（二）印花稅零售時、如屬强酒、酒瓶上須貼印花美金一分、（三）牌照稅、（甲）躉售商每年納營業稅美金一百元、（乙）零售商每年納營業稅美金二十五元、（丙）製造商每年納營業稅美金二百元、產量每年在五百桶以下者、納美金一百元、</p>

<p>（三）影片之營業方法</p>
<p>影片之營業方法大的可分為下列三種：</p>
<p>（一）拆賬—卽影片開映之券資收入，影片公司與戲院分拆，惟成數各有不同，普通辦法，為戲院公司各五成，此外四六分拆，三七分拆，或公司多而戲院少，或戲院多而公司少，各依情形不同而異，目前上海各戲院，無論中外，大多採用此法。｜</p>
<p>（二）租片—戲院與影片公司租賃影片，訂定日期租價，自行開映，公司方面但收租金，不再拆賬，租價視各埠之情形，及時間之多寡而定，如租複映之片，其價當可較廉，此種方式犬多用於佳片，蓋戲院認定此片，確有賣座把握，乃事前訂定租價，所得當較拆賬為多，而公司方面亦可免除拆賬之麻煩。</p>
<p>（三）購買專映權—卽戲院或中間經理商向公司購買拷貝一份，訂定價目及區域，在該區域內，公司或其他片商不得放映同樣影片，此種方法，南洋片商用之最多，上海如南怡公司購買卓別林「摩登時代」專映權卽是，其價格無一定標準。</p>
<p>（四）各影片公開發中心之現狀</p>
<p>（一）各影片公司之現狀—現有公司之數目，已較前大减，此蓋由於技術之進步，觀衆程度之提高，使粗製溫造者不能立足，以及政府嚴禁投機所致，據聯華公司調查所得，上海現有公司十一家，其中實際製片著僅七家，今列表如下：</p>
<p>實際製片之影片公司</p>
<p>名稱　負責人　名稱　負責人</p>
<p>明星　張石川　聯華　羅明佑</p>
<p>天一　邵醉翁　藝華　嚴春棠</p>
<p>新華　張善琨　快活林張丙生</p>
<p>上海　但杜宇</p>
<p>其餘有公司而未製片者四家如左：</p>
<p>名稱　負責人　名稱　負責人</p>
<p>月明　任彭年　曁南　黃槐生</p>
<p>中華　卜萬蒼　吉星　吳文超</p>
<p>最近閉歇之影片公司，共有四家，今亦列記於後：</p>
<p>電通　篤建德　文化</p>
<p>志成　王君達　新時代葉淺予</p>

<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份呈初平繼則　俏之象、本月份初開、以洋麥上落無幾、仍開四元九角六七分、惟拍至九月份、則以政府注意食糧、各地倉庫均須準備、因此業中人心思、一致高昂、開價卽好三四分　　盤以後、本月份形勢亦緊、最高曾突破五元零二分、其餘月份、交易甚暢、價則轉定、此後情形、將看出口問題、是否得一解决、市面方可安定耳、現麥市面、因客戶扳售、廠胃尙佳、各情又提漲五分、開臨淮關張八嶺瑤灣麥五元零五分、六合麥四元五角半、次八角、江西麥八元七角八分、全椒麥五元、决四元九角半、江新州麥四元九角半、浦鎭麥四元九角、决八角五六分、太倉麥四元八角一分、淮安麥五元、决九角半、蕪湖麥四元八角七分、由福新辦七千包、阜豐辦一千包、至日商方面、暫無動靜云、</p>
<h3 id="c189">洋荘芝蔴　公會已有期貨　最高價已到十二元七角 <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>標準洋荘芝蔴、交易所因距出新時間、尙有　個月左右、故無拍做、惟雜糧帮在公會市塲、已有預　買賣、週前開價、　十一元五角、近以洋商問津、（係德意兩國）巿面緊俏異常、聞前日已漲十二元六角、至昨日初緊至六角半、最後竟高至十　元七角、尙有買補不着之勢、近來中國農產、出口步見擴大、在不景氣衰落狀態中、殊有逆轉之可能云、</p>

<p>昨日客秈市况、到頭雖旺、日有六七千包抵埠、而去路更活、日銷萬餘包、昨日本街內地辦胃更貪、復有北洋帮問津、兼因報載當局因今年農產豐收、主張提高農產價格以濟農村、一方趕辦各地倉庫儲積、一方另籌出路、因此人心更為望好、經本客暢辦、市價立卽跳漲二三角、而人心尙在繼續望好中、昨全市開出江西米四千八百十包、溫台米七百十包、漢口新糙二千五百包、江北米七百八十包、大絞一千五百包、辦胃以不　　　　　　　　　　　　亦　　　　云</p>

<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源、共到十五六號、貨共三千餘石、本衛銷塲轉懈、包胃大遠靑島帮辦四百餘包、故市况雖屬定局、而形勢似見帶軟、厚薄粳行情悉無榮娣、杜洋尖亦相仿、陰變元平勢、東新共到一千餘石、去路　前略遜、價守原盤、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各貨到埠無幾、共十一二號白粳銷路淸淡、變陰　零銷尙活、羊杜埠客尖平常、薄稻貨稀、白粳高貨定局中、次帶緊、羊杜埠客尖提起數分、薄稻無榮辱、變陰元亦緊數分、東新粳到頭略多、去胃平平、價形定格、</p>

<p>本埠絲市、仍以用　進胃較宏、猶以　東黃白廠經及四川楊返絲為活躍、前昨兩日、上列各絲共售開六十二箱、價格堅穩如常、昨日橫濱絲價微　三二元不等、國外洋莊絲交仍在擯特中、且本埠自施行强迫檢騐後、外銷絲品之買賣手續、尙未一致、（絲廠商及出口商因手續之改善均各持異議）故出口絲交易不無多少受一打擊云、</p>
<h3 id="c193">珍眉綠茶交易岑寂 <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>昨日　茶　　、仍趨　軟、來　荘之珍　綠茶、提　抽芯貨去路依然呆滯、色溪　源等路普通莊貨、協和怡和同孚杜德等行、頗多購進、但因摩洛哥來價緊　、華商人心軟弱、市盤已開至七十元左右、遂安歙縣貨跌至五十七八元、較前又跌二三元、針眉珠茶等項、亦路有走銷、惟祁寗紅茶、昨市依然沉　、市情漸趨衰落云、</p>
<p>又據茶業公會報吿云、昨綠茶市復趨靜態、珍眉交易寥寥　　　週暢銷之貫熙白頭行亦形懈淡、僅上星期六忙和所議之中徽珍眉五百餘額、價六十五元至七十元、昨已正式成交、平水茶大帮錦隆續進天香及嫩玉兩帮、另色珠茶、協和的辦八百七十箱、價五十六至五十八元云、</p>

<p>蘭竹枝中市步降以來、漳州產價未能隨小、近且反見加漲、因此來源寥寥、趨勢逐步轉機、昨聞較高之貨、已開升一元許、但照產價划申、尙難合算、故號方尙有少許存貨觀望、猶未脫手、如後批到少、或須續緊、</p>
<p>蘭花子前批初出少數、開價甚昂、近以正水貨已發塲、為數漸增、昨聞開出百數十箱、比之前盤又小三四元、　後降　已近十元、查本　貨品頗佳、不特黃亮芬芳、而身份亦較乾、　乎　　未净、是為美中不足、業是者似宜改良，須將砂屑去净、以廣銷路云、</p>

<p>— （瘦鵑）</p>
<p>我雖從沒有到過廣東，但這轟轟烈烈的革命策源地，早在我心坎深處留下一個很深的印象了。印象最深的，尤其是辛亥三月二十九日廣州之役，給革命大業殺開一條血路，灑熱血，拋頭顱，慷慨就義者七十二人、當時我曾為他們歌，為他們哭，為他們憂傷而憔悴。二十餘年來憧憧心頭的，就是那七十二烈長眠著的一座黃花崗；因黃花崗而懷念着這策動革命的聖地——廣東。</p>
<p>今夏陳伯南稱兵異動，劍拔弩張，我兀自惴惴的，深怕那七十二位有犧牲而無權利的烈士，連黃花崗下也不能安眠了。幸而廣東的將領們都深明大義，反對內戰；粵王台畔，重見光風霽月，使這七年來貌合神離的廣東，從獨夫手中還到中央政府的旗幟下來。喜統一之吿成，國是之有望，作廣東專頁。</p>
<h3 id="c197">廣東的革命一前輩 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 紫微</p>
<p>客有譚東粵起義逸聞者，吿我以余育之先生囊贊革命事。</p>
<p>先生粵之台山人，家本殷富，設銀肆於香港，性豪放，喜結交，通方言，精夷文，少具卓識，鑒於强隣虎視，華冑雌伏，滿胡秉國，朝綱廢弛，先生惄焉憂之。會先總理過港倡革命，遂與訂交，嘗追隨總理跋涉南洋新嘉坡間，與黨國前輩陳少白李紀堂允烈胡展堂馮自由謝英伯輩均多往還，邇時淸庭嚴緝黨人急，先生隱於商業，不為人知，故陰負傳遞消息之責，聲氣賴以暢通，而輸金濟困，周急黨人，尤著功勛。辛亥而後，募集巨欵協助總理，使飼源有自，無虞匱乏，然先生家亦中落矣。時李煜堂任財廳，先生經胡展堂氏委派長財部，終不受命，蓋旣有李在，未便予奪，祗薦族侄澄淸任金庫長者十餘年。迨總理駐粵，先生上書獻策，聯絡港商，以資應手，當邀採納，曾派孫哲生氏携親筆函照等件為代表，抵港至天祥洋行賬房，由先生伴見劉韋諸港紳，商謀合作，事遂諧。民十二，總理開府西南，駐驛河南士敏土廠，集合各省義軍，策動討賊。時先生滯留津沽，卽委楊惠吉同志南下獻策，又蒙總理嘉納，立命先生任中央財政委員會委員，先生以病辭。年來經營商業，頻遭拂逆，六八衰翁，猶復奔走於滬市，為謀斗升以治生。子六人，長决任職香港太古船務，三四任職香港德士古汽油公司，五居海上，經營大華利酵粉事業，幼則尙在攻讀。先生不慕利祿，不求聞達。不仰給於幼輩，功成身退，亦可尙已。</p>
<h3 id="c198">廣州的茶樓 <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 舍利</p>
<p>廣州入嗜茶之癖，大概在中國要算是第一了。</p>
<p>一早起來，就撤開步往茶樓里跑。茶樓門口，總有一個報攤擺着，各種大小報都有。這種報攤，賣的時候很少，差不多都是租給茶客們帶上茶樓去看的，租價每份五個銅板。一些文雅點的茶客們，扔下五個銅子，便挾了一份報來到茶樓上，預備消磨一個上午。</p>
<p>廣州茶樓之大且多，在中國也要算第一。差不多每一條熱鬧的街上，都有一個很大的茶樓，佈置非常富麗而淸潔，遝有女招待。有些顧客們一邊喝着茶，一邊讀報，一邊和女招待搭訕着，在忙中却顯得極其閒逸。這種閒逸的情景也只有在廣州的茶樓上看得見。</p>
<p>茶樓上穿梭似地忙着的是賣各種點心的小販，點心名目之多，也是別處所沒有的。碟子特別小，一隻包子也是一碟，一塊蛋糕也是一碟，有時候這些碟子會擺滿了一桌，而你的肚子還沒有裝飽。</p>
<p>在別的地方，泡茶總是用茶壺，廣州茶樓上却都是用的蓋碗，另外一隻小杯，呌你自己倒。這呌沒用慣的外地人倒起來，時常會倒得滿桌子都是水的。</p>

<h3 id="c200">廣州東的避暑勝地 <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— 芳踪</p>
<p>局勢方才底定的廣東，它位在中國的最南都，地近熱帶，氣候常然很炎熱。但炎熱的南國，並不缺乏避暑的勝地；在廣州市的四郊，共有四處，這四處地方現在都熟鬧繁華，並不因時局緊張而改變常態。現在我把這四個地方的　介紹如下：</p>
<p>（一）黃婆洞　黃婆洞離開廣州很近，可說在市的範圍以來，去避暑的人，儘可以早去晚歸。那裏有淸澈的流水，蔭濃的纔樹，山石嶙崎，野花　地，不　桃源，而且在淸凉的溪流中，還可駕舟，游泳，所以靑年男女，以及機關銀行的小職員，都愛到那裏去盡情暢游，盡一日歡，而且因為路途較近，所賣也極省。</p>
<p>（二）從化溫泉　從化的溫泉，自經黨國要人銳意經營後，卽名震白粵；而胡展堂先生在逝世前一再到那裏去養病，討論時局，更加名聞全國了。從廣州市釗從化，乘從化公路的汽車，只消　小時可到，那裏靑山綠水，建設十分現代化，而飛泉百丈，瀑布高懸，更顯得壯麗。要人們的別墅到處皆是，售賣點心，生菒，汽水，紙　的，隨處可得。這裏是要人和公務人員遊樂的天國。</p>
<p>（三）淸遠峽　淸遠峽距離廣州市較遠，所以去的人必須小住幾天，或把整僩暑期，都在那裏過去。而那裏的風景，淸幽雄壯，有如仙境，從琵江口乘艦而往，兩岸山巒聳翠，綠蔭蔽天，不啻淸凉世界，而瀑布飛泉，到處皆有，怪石巉岩，驚險萬狀，更為他處所不及。並且還有飛霞洞，太和洞，女修道院，峽山古寺等名勝，入夏以來，已成富商大賈公子小姐的世界了。</p>
<p>（四）羅浮山　博羅羅浮山，也因為胡展堂氏的一再往遊，已經同杭州西湖一樣的婦孺皆知了。從廣州到羅浮，有汽車可通，所以交通極便。羅浮的景色，十分雄壯，全山五百餘峯，以老人玉女兩峯最為著名。古代的達榮有沖　觀，白　觀，黃龍觀等道院，到那裏去不玩上一兩月，不能瀏覽殆遍。今年建設猛進，有公園，有水電廠，所以外人的避暑者，都以羅浮為目的地。</p>
<h3 id="c201">南國的月夜 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— （黃克威）</p>
<p>南國的月夜像一首美麗的散文詩，一張桃色的樂譜；它的調子是含着溫柔的音韻，它的景色是富有幽靜的風味，多夠使人愛戀而迷醉呵！</p>
<p>那暗綠淺邊，流水打飄浮着的闊葉子上彎曲地遊過，像幾縷銀色的小蛇；水渡撞擊着圓滑的靑石子，彈出一種均勻的音調，像一個少女的柔和的呼吸。從海灘吹來的風是　辣的，搖着棕櫊樹的長煞鬚，時有幾隻水鳥，衝破了雪亮的銀波，向着皓月飛去，在明藍的夜空裏留下一聲嘹喨的呌聲。</p>
<p>躺在椰干林下悄悄地吹着口哨，月亮正斜掛在樹梢，如水的光綫漏過了稀棘的葉子，彷彿酒下一把琉璃磅片，亮亮地，舖地松針編　着的草地上，沉碧　大海上，在銀色的旋渦裏，飛魚愉快地浮沉着。</p>
<p>輕輕的撥着二絃琴，唱一曲孤獨者之歌，懷戀那為生活而流浪在旅程上的漂泊的姑娘：伊有棕紅的健康的皮色，伊有紫葡萄似的黑眼珠子，伊有海波一樣的柔髮，伊有南國在放的熱情和潑刺的特性，想到在芭蕉樹下許多溫甜的夢，在荔枝林裏搶吃黑荔枝的情景，聲調慘慢的變得凄厲而顫抖了！</p>
<p>愉快呵，南國的月夜！</p>
<p>海上小艇裏有一羣孩子唱着南國的月夜歌划着快槳飛去了。</p>
<h3 id="c202">廣州的攤館 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 白夏</p>
<p>粵政革新之始，中央方面就命令速行嚴禁烟睹。烟暗在廣東省內因有不少年的歷史，目省府歲收大部分要靠烟睹捐稅的彌補，故余漢謀氏乃電中央請求暫綏。嚴禁烟賭廣東烟賭之禁止，雖暫緩實施，但此乃時間問題而已。在不久之將來，總有完全禁絕之一日，因廣東一般向上的民衆，都已憎恨烟賭，而事實上烟賭之為害已的確是厲害！</p>
<p>廣州的攤館，就是特為賭博者而設的機關，平常也有稱之為「番攤館」的。這種攤館，在北伐之前，大多設在廣州市內，復因有碍觀瞻，乃一律搬往廣州對岸的河南。河南本來是一個不很發展的地方，自攤館完全設立在河南之後，遂一變而為繁盛之區。所謂繁盛的意思，就是，多了不少酒家茶樓，同時還增加了一些專為賭徒而設的特等烟館。年前又建築了一層珠江鐵橋，使廣州與河南的交通更方便，是以河南的攤館，酒家，茶樓……等的生意，也較前昌盛。</p>
<p>廣州攤館，一向是由防務經費局承包的，卽一切的捐稅，全由商人組織的防務經費局承受，至攤館的盈虧與否，政府概不過問。防務經費局承包後，又再行零碎的包與小賭商，但自陳濟棠上台後，廣州的攤館已成立了托拉斯，卽由霍芝庭一人承包，一人經營。霍芝庭是廣東的一位大烟賭棍，他用以統制攤館的托拉斯公司的名稱，是呌做「裕泰公司」，只要我們一到廣州，便很容易的瞧見在河岸上，有許多蠻大的脾子寫着「裕泰艮牌公司」的字樣。晚間這些大字還放着霓光，把廣州的河道點綴得更為美麗。</p>
<p>攤館本有艮牌與錢攤之分，艮牌是大賭博的機關，任賭客賣下多少錢他們都承受，錢攤則是小賭博的地方，賭客全是苦力小工，只要有幾個銅子便可以賭一賭。廣州的攤館自給霍芝庭一手把攬之後，乃設無數的攤館，分佈於河南各街道里巷上。這些攤館都有同一的名字就是「裕泰公司」。</p>
<p>「番攤」是廣東一種特有的賭博形式，很像北方的「押寶」。但「番攤」多至四門，卽一，二，三，四。開攤的用的是瓷製的或銅製的（也是用舊銅錢）的骰子。「殺攤」（開攤的人）的揑了一把骰子蓋在特製的杯子的下面，賭客就可隨意下注。如果你下的注是「一」，開出來的骰子也是「一」，那件就算是買中了。你如單獨賣「一」，這呌做「孤番」，一塊錢可賠三塊錢，但要扣了一個九折，結果連本在內也可得三元七角。你如賣的是「角」，卽同時買兩個數目，則只是一塊錢賠一塊錢，還要打個九折。此外還有所謂「簾」，「三門」……等等的買法，可說名目繁多。</p>
<p>在攤館里做工的人，除「殺攤」之外，還有保管銀錢的「銀台」　這等於賬房；還有「打荷」，這是專任收錢賠錢的，這種人對於敎學一定要很糖，才可以勝任；還有「吊籮」，是專任把樓上的高尙的賭客的賭欵用籮子吊下下面的攤台的。</p>
<p>能够跑上樓上去賭的，一定是大賭客，他們動輒就下注數十元，數百元，甚至於數千元，攤館對這些人是特別優待的，他們一踏上二樓，茶役就送茶來，送烟來，送瓜子來，送靑菓來，有時還送點心來，總之是盡量的巴結賭客們，使他們雖則賭輸了錢，也感到是過了一刻的快樂生活。</p>
<p>攤館方面因為能够打了一個九折，所以總是贏錢的，　芝庭能够積下了數千萬的財產，就全靠攤館掙來的。但攤館對待工作人員，薪水也不能說很苛，經常每個工作人員，每日只做二次工，每次四個鐘頭。「殺攤」的就可以拏到每天一元五角的薪水，「吊籮」的，「長台」的都是一元五角，「打荷」則有頭手與一手之分，頭手的一元八角，二手的一元五角。但道種薪水是沒有一定的，還要看　這一家攤館所佔的地位如何，如果這攤館是次等的，薪水則還要低减。這說的是艮牌，至於那些在錢攤上做工的人，薪水還要低得多哩！</p>

<p>— 黃貽淸</p>
<p>剪短了髮就完事，梳刮捲打全不管。</p>
<p>國人理髮，給起工錢來，每因理髮師處理得細到，格外要在規定價目以外多賞一些。這分明是獎勵理髮師愈細到愈好，愈「把結」愈好。實際在無意識和器具不施消毒的情况下，理髮師愈細到，愈足以招致細菌，愈「把結」，愈顯得是特別和細菌「把結」。</p>
<p>外僑在我國內地理髮，却只須理髮師動了軋剪和剪子，把頭髮修短了就完事，不用撣刷，不用篦梳，也絕對不用洗面，修面，更絕對用不到挖耳，打眼，刮鼻，理完了髮，總是自己帶了短髮，入浴操洗一過，浴後，頭髮用笨刺稀梳或鬃刷爬梳一過，便得：修面並且總是用自己底保險刀修刮的。你看這種理髮，何等乾脆！我國理髮師底技能不至於如此簡陋，難道他們不知道嗎？他們又何以不敢頒敎呢？</p>
<p>這個理由，說起來本極平常。眼睛，耳朶和鼻子，是多麽名貴的和嬌嫩的器官，怎樣可以打咧，挖咧，刮咧，隨便給理髮師弄得！他們在本國，本來沒有聽說過。要是挖打致傷，那末「破船多徠儎」，無異給細菌開種種傳染之門，更屬意計中事。又，在不知消毒為何事的理髮店裏擱着的面布面盆，剃刀刀布，倒說不致染菌，誰肯相信？他們在本國，受了某理　轉的害，染到了什麼病，可立刻向地方衛生機關吿發那理髮師的玩忽業務，官廳査問屬實，可馬上把他的營業執照吊銷：假使在我國因理髮受了什麽傳染，鬧了什麽病，倒好去告訴阿誰？</p>
<p>（按刮鼻極易刮傷鼻粘膜，染到傷風，膿菌，丹毒，麻風，梅毒，中耳炎——由傷風染及，腦膜炎——由中耳炎染及（較罕遇）。外耳道被挖，受了微微的傷，極易染到癤病，慢性皮炎，外耳炎，觸染性膿皰，蜂窩織炎。盯嚀也愈挖愈多；刺破了鼓膜膿菌並易染及中耳。打眼時極易受沙眼，紅眼——急性粘膜炎性結合膜炎，淋病性眼炎等等傳染。修面，洗面時，易從剃刀染到觸染性膿皰，丹毒，梅毒（二病較罕遇），從面布染到沙眼，紅眼，淋病性眼炎（較罕遇；毛巾一乾，淋菌卽死）。篦梳不但易於激生皮脂溢性皮炎和頭皮屑，如果剔去了皮膚一塊，並且容易染顱皮膿性炎和丹毒；在兒童，尤易受髮癬，黃癬——鬎瘡，頭虱和觸染性膿皰的傳染。用毛刷揮刷，新的羊毛刷容易染炭疽，髒的毛刷容易染廊病。）</p>
<p>雖然，就我國情形論，理髮時侯的牽涉到眼，耳，和鼻，本是多事，一無是處，我們却絕對可以革除這種陋習，不許理髮師亂動。至於修面，因為國人不能個個置備一柄保險刀，仍非仰藉理髮師兼理不可，木梳有時也還不得不用。所以折衷辦法，最好使用儘管使用，一面該參酌些外國理髮店遵奉營業規章，對軋剪剪子所施消毒方法——一理髮師備刀剪三四份，用完，把它置在佛馬林殺菌器裏二小時，或常常浸在來蘇溶液裏消毒備用（按事實上後法要生銹，理髮師不甚樂用）——，在學校或他種可以自由管理的社團裏中，設法隨時消毒——法，待用的剃刀軋剪和剪子，可備一瓶酒精，敎理髮師常把它浸在裏面：面布最好由各人自備，或是依舊公用，但估計每日理髮的人數，如數多備幾條，敎理發師規定每人使用一塊乾净面布，晚上必放在蒸籠裏或特製簡便蒸箱裏煮一刻鐘，以待次日再用；木梳木製的也用煮的方法消毒，角質的敎他用過一决，用酒精擦抹一次。個人獨自走到巿上的理髮店裏去，最好帶一些酒精或上好白乾酒（燒酒），在理髮師使用刀剪以前，把它擦一擦，面布也最好自己帶去，或是先敎他用開水滌洗過一次，或是也像外僑，畢竟做個「迂先生」，只剪髮，不刮臉，一切「加油加醬」，「拖泥帶水」的頑意兒，什麼都不用他理會。</p>
<p>又近來有人並或因燙髮直接致死，京滬二地，已不乏先例。在不相干的人說來，這也十分乾脆。作者道，這只是死的乾脆；乾脆地說，在沒有燙髮能手的去處，不燙也罷！</p>

<p>訓政將吿厥成，不日將選國民代表千二百人，組織代表會議參預中央政府國民代表大會，卽為國民政府在訓政完成後歸政於民之接受機關之人員，卽為國民代表，然則此千二百人之國民代表之職責何等重大！</p>
<p>按國民大會代表選舉第二條第二欵，依職業選舉方法者，三百八十名，又按自由職業團體代表名額表，醫藥師團體，代表名額八，此次選舉規定醫師藥師，混為一種自由職業實極不妥，因此醫師在國民大會巾，實在所佔之代表名額，必不過八大。將來選政吿藏，由本自由職業團體所選出之代表，的占全代表額數千分之六强。雜然，此少數之由醫師職業團體所選出之代表，其使命之嚴重，實有與由其他區域選舉曁職業選舉所選出之代表，有不同者，請剖析言之。</p>
<p>我國本有病夫之誚，人民對於醫事衛生，素無定識，或固執其似是而非之見，或竟以衛生為無足輕重，一切托諸天命，相沿成習，民族日弱，兼以嗜好烟酒者日多，婦孺衛生之不講，超格死亡率至可驚人，平均人壽，每况愈下，不但人口之有形低落，人民體質方面，亦愈趨於孱弱，兼之影響所及，社會經濟，無形中亦有問接或直接之損失，此種情形，其惟一受極大之損失者，實為國家，今春全國醫師聯合會在漢口開第四次代表大會時，曾有請中央厲行民族優生之决議，實有鑒於此。國民大會中由醫師自由職業團體所選出之代表，首當注意者也。</p>
<p>以言醫藥國防，在平時醫藥之適合與吾，為全國人民之所托命者，公共衛生之各種作為及不作為，例如防疫問題防癆防麻瘋乃至微至牙齒健康注意之問題，在在與國家入民有直接間接之種種關係，故醫事衛生政策目標之廈定及事實之設施，又不能謂與國防無關係，其在戰事，醫藥國防之關係更切，前方之救治，後方之療護，以及戰時疫　之擈減及人民病傷之救濟等，在在須有縝密之計劃，此種標準及計劃，其規定及實施之者，要有事門之眼光及有盛大之服務忠忱，方克有濟。</p>
<p>以言衛生敎育，實為當前之要團，吾人知敎育之力量最厚，往昔民族孱弱之因，衛生敎育之不講，有以致之，故國民大會中由醫師自由職業團體所選出之代表，務官認淸衛生教育之重要性，何去何從，毅然决然以行使其職權。</p>
<p>農村凋疲，貧病日多，彼呻吟床褥無力醫藥者，屈指難計，卽中產階級，對於疾病醫療，亦有不勝負擔之慷，此於病者個人，固直接蒙受健康上乃至生命之不幸，卽國家及社會，亦受秩序上及經濟上之損害，故醫療救濟原則之厘定為當前重要之問題，尤以健康保險法規之創制，為不可或緩，其設施其內容，要當在在有利於民，又不待煩言而可决，此亦當加以注意者也。</p>

<p>— 汪章藻</p>
<p>我們是畫間注射，演講，調査；晚間化裝表演，旣不妨碍鄉農的工作，反可恢復他們終日勞動的疲困，至於各地注射的人數，是以各地衛生敎育的程而有增减，不過鄕民已深知道：時疫流行的毒害，打防疫針並沒有遇了什麽困難。我們在演劇的時候，視衆都能發生興趣，平均每地注射人數，的在五百人以上，合計共注了四千多人。觀劇者每處也在千人以上。我們從各方面證明，農民需要衛生設施的利益，科學醫療救護的迫切，設或有人來提倡，興辦鄕村衛生的事業，鄕民未嘗不樂意，贊同協助進行的。</p>
<p>（丁）結論</p>
<p>農村在中國的重要性，隨時隨地可以找出事實來蹬明：以人口論，農民佔全國人口百分之八十以上，以土地論，則農地佔大半數；以出口貨論，要算農產為最多數：其他如國家的收入；國內工業的原料，亦多取自農村，故農村已成為國家經濟的某礎，我們要得國家富强，就應使國家的基礎，（農村）先健全起來才對。</p>
<p>然而中國農村的不幸，自從九一八國難以後，農村受了天災人禍的摧殘，已頻於破產的難境。我們只要一到農村，就聽見呼救的哀鳴。離則各地復興農村的呼聲很高，他們挽救的法則是多方面的；有經濟，社會，政治，敎育，農業改良，……這許多的問題；但是對於農村醫藥衛生的問題，恐怕還沒有人想到呢？</p>
<p>追本求源的說：凡欲求健全的事業，必需有健全的身體。我國農民因不知道衛生的要義，平時又失養生之道，所以鄕村間的砂眼，疥瘡，黃癬，肺結核等病，是不斷的侵略到農民。尤其是在時疫流行的時候，格外令人可怕，至少發生四種不良的現象：</p>
<p>（一）鄉民生病，因為祈神拜佛無效，以致耗費金錢。</p>
<p>（二）鄉民因為不延醫診治，容易多誤</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>人民。</p>
<p>（三）鄉民因為預防不得共法，容易擴張區域，以致死亡率增加，人口减少。</p>
<p>（四）鄕民因為疾病，有田不能種，以致减少生產率。</p>
<p>綜觀上述，敝校同學，皆以我們是中華的國民，在這非常的時期中，當然要將我們所學，貢獻給社會，所以在這决暑假，寗可犧牲小我的舒適，决謀大我們幸福。除了前後在外巡迴宣傳十二天，以促人民注意夏令衛生外；並且各人自購科學醫藥器械，分至各中心鄕鎭，組織鄕民診療所，解除鄉民疾病的痛苦。同時我們還得請求全國的醫藥界，不要再顧自私自利，到農村去，普遍的保障農民的生命；鞏固國家經濟的基礎，以備與侵略我國的帝國主義，作一生存的决戰。所以我們說：農村衛生的普遍化，農民體格的健强化，也就是解决國難的一個方針。</p>

<p>— 林鑑賢</p>
<p>（第二二一問）　拔牙後為什麽要常用漱口藥水漱口？</p>
<p>答　身體各處皮膚上的創口，都可用消毒紗布，嚴密遮卦，以免微菌侵入，惟有拔齒創，是門戶開放的，無法可以把牠和口內很多的微菌，完全隔離。所以必須用含漱藥水來减少口內微菌的數量和活動以减少創口被侵襲的機會。在拔牙後的三日內，每小時應該含漱一次，每决要含一分鐘以上。有膿的牙齒，允應勤漱。</p>
<p>（第二二二問）　拔牙後還有什麼事情，病家應該注意的？</p>
<p>答　不可用力吸創口，或用舌舐創口，以免出血。不可過度勞動，心情宜鎭靜。烟酒等刺激物，應該暫時禁止。食物宜擇柔軟的，食時用其他一邊牙齒咀嚼。如創口內塞有紗布若是不再至醫生處診察時，不可任其留存至四五日之久，以免藏積汚物，及阻礙牙肉的生長。</p>
<p>（第二二三問）　拔牙後牙肉內幾時會長好？</p>
<p>答　大約二星期至四星期，要看各人體力年齡等而定的。</p>
<p>（第二二四問）　街上撑大陽傘的，或做鑲牙匠的拔牙，有什麽危險</p>
<p>答　他們對於麻醉和消毒的原理及手續，沒有什麽學識，對於牙齒部份的解剖學組織學等，更莫明其妙，所以有某只牙齒是血牙，某只牙齒和腦筋相通等等謬說。他們的鉗子注射針等沒有經過適當的消毒拔齒創受其傳染而致發生種種危險的炎症，成為不治者有之，拔斷的牙根，任牠留存使病家腫痛不堪者有之。要免除這種危險的行為，一方面固然恃當局有力的取締，一方面還須各人自己有眞切的認識，不要因為隣人朋輩一言的保證，就甘以身嘗試。</p>

<p>（九十五）學校兒童聽力診查之必要</p>
<p>衛生一道。範圍至廣。普通分為個人衛生，公衆衛生，學校衛生，及工廠衛生。個人衛生係講究個人的衣食起居。是由個人自己遵守的。公衆衛生係謀民衆的幸福。是由政府提倡的。學校衛生係養成具有强健體格的靑年。是由學校當局改良的。工廠衛生係保障工友的生命安全。是由廠方設計的。學校衛生中，尤以體格檢査最為重要。若為兒童，則更宜特別注意他們的聽力診査。蓋從多數的統計結果觀察起來。我們知道就學兒童。的有四分之一。對於言語一層。是缺乏正常聽力的。聽力障碍的有無。關於智能發達上的影響很大。這是因為聽器實係輸入學童敎育上各事的主要門戶的綠故。正常聽力，是以能得聽取在二十五米突以上距離的耳語（低音語）為標準。如果耳語祗能在八米突以內聽取者。那就對於完全敎育的輸入。卽可感覺困難。學校敎師往往懊解兒童所患的難聽。多歸罪於兒童的怠惰，愚笨，或疏忽。實不知其為由於難聽的結果所釀成。由醫師立塲上說起來。則患有難聽的學童。且有兩種的損失。卽（一）不能與其他兒童同時同樣的受敎育。（二）多有化腺性中耳炎。隨時可有引起迷路疾患或頭蓋內合併症的可能。亦有因而致命者。若為慢性化膿性中耳炎。則由耳漏的惡臭。常使敎室內的空氣。轉為不潔。且易媒介各種傳染病（例如流行性感冒，結核等病。）我們若欲預防這等不幸事件的發生。固然並不困難。惟一的方法。就是囑托專門醫師施行聽力的診査。以冀早期發現。而行適當的治療。但是事實上，每每不易辦到。因為對於時間，費用，及家屬。往往不免發生問題。所以為便利着想。最好由校醫於體格檢査時。特別注意診査。同時尤宜參照敎師的成績報吿。蓋成績之良否。常與聽力發生密切的關係（前已詳連）。診査者切不可忽視及此。講到聽力診査的方針。可別為五。卽</p>
<p>（一）左右兩耳的聽力。須各別檢査。一側外聽道，可用同側示指閉塞。因此可以確實診定聽力减退的耳側。</p>
<p>（二）被檢兒童不可面對檢査者。因為常可依照檢査者的口唇述動。容易想像不得聽取的言語。</p>
<p>（三）檢査時候所使用的言語。亦宜選擇。一般專門醫師常用數目來檢査。比較容易得着精確的檢査成績。數目的種類。尤以一，七，三十七，四十七，七十七等等為佳。此外亦可應用汽車，黃包車，電車，火車，自來水，牛奶，咖啡，及永安公司等等名稱來檢査。</p>
<p>（四）由耳語所得的聽取距離。須就各語分別記載。以便日後專門醫師推定疾病種類之用。</p>
<p>（五）耳語的强弱。常須一定。否則所得的結果。每有差異。依照上照五條診査後。若有兒童患</p>
<p>有難聽。則應立卽通知患兒的家長。說明與學業的關係及有醫治的必要。至於醫治的方針。則由專門醫師診査决定。一般醫治學童難聽的結果。的有半數以上。可以完全恢復。但是對於恢復不完全及醫治無效的兒童。則又如何處置呢？我們若欲解决這種問題。則可援用德國名敎授哈德門氏（Hartmann）的一個建議。他的建議分為三種。卽</p>
<p>（一）高度難聽　具有比較良好聽力的耳語聽取距離。為半米突以下。</p>
<p>（二）中等度難聽　具有比較良好聽力的耳語聽取距離。為半至三米突？</p>
<p>（三）輕度難聽　具有比較良好聽力的耳語聽取距離。為三至八米突。</p>
<p>對於輕度或中等度難聽的兒童。座位須在講臺的附近。尤以容易面對同學的座位為最佳。因為在敎師與同學問答的時候，可由同學的口唇運動。來補充他的聽力不足。對於高度難聽的兒童。則以有比較良好聽力的耳側。對向講聽。至於最高度難聽的兒童。則須另設一級。稱為難聽學級。採用一種特別的敎授法。</p>

<p>— 我</p>
<p>據最近消息，西班牙的亂事，自巴達育士被攻陷後，叛軍的聲勢益壯，穆拉發出激烈演詞，拒絕任何和議，摩洛哥僅有的政府軍，亦宣佈附逆，看這種戰報情形，西國的現政府，大靠不住，革命軍有取而代之的趨勢，其情勢已屬顯然，政府軍慕後的帮忙者，為英，為法，革命軍慕後的帮忙者，為德為意，故名義上是西國的內亂，其實是民洽主義與法西主義，正在那里鬥法的一慕戲劇。</p>
<p>現在英法兩國，看到情勢不佳，倘使兩方演變下去，恐成第二次歐戰的局面，是以迭次聲明，不預聞西國的亂事，不接濟任何方面軍火，到底此種聲明，絕少微弱的影響，於是英法兩國商妥，訂立禁止軍火運往西國的協定，兩國已在巴黎交換牒文，據云，若意德兩國不表示反對，卽發生效力，我於此種恊定，能减少引起世界的大戰性助可，而欲使意德兩國，幕後不去帮忙，是絕不可能。</p>
<p>民治主義雖經一度風行，但到現在已成落伍，少有信奉之者，而法西主義，現在正是「貨賣當時」，十分摩登，故民治主義之不敵法西主義，其情勢已昭然可見。據瑪里十四日電，叛軍所佔領各城市，定於明日，一致懸掛紅黃兩色旗，慶祝勝利，按紅黃兩色，代表赤血與黃金，係叛軍當局所指定，作為正式旗幟者，這種旗幟，眞是鮮明。</p>
<p>一國的國旗，本來代表一國的國意，怎樣主義的國家，用怎樣形色的旗幟，令人一望可知，西國叛軍的國旗，用紅黃兩色，實是表現革命軍的精神，現在的國家除鐵血與金錢外，還有何物，欲得金錢，必須殺人，不會殺人，决得不到金錢，故殺人愈多者，則金錢也愈多，故俗有「血飯」之稱，又有稱金錢為血，稱人錢多，則曰血多，稱人錢少，則曰血少，其用意正是相同。</p>
<p>所以欲一地爭奪錢財，必令一地的人出血，欲在世界爭奪錢財，必令世界人出血，不出血，不罷休，現在人的聰明，人的殘忍，人的認識，原不過如此而已。</p>

<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>——山行雜什</p>
<p>把整日的時間都消磨在茶館里。</p>
<p>這山城的茶館本來是不値得留戀的，無論在設備上以至招待上，然而，我們顧不了這些，坐在長大的木凳上，泡上一大壺淸茶，讓心情靜了下去，傾聽着不同階層的人談吐着不同的話語，把整個的山城，讓嘴吧傳出了每一個縮影</p>
<p>——西山溝的水暴發了，門頭壩兩回都沒有趕市！說話的是小商人模樣的人，有一副憂愁的苦臉，坐在靠近的桌子上：老二你想，兩次的損失也不算小了呵！</p>
<p>自己對於路上的事，本來是很關懷的，這更引起了我的注意，心里想：山洪暴發，也許是造成車子停頓的原因吧？看看其他的人，只各自的保持着靜默，滿不在乎的樣子。</p>
<p>之後，由於輾轉的探詢，螺獅堰的一段路程，是被大水掩沒了。四周的山田都成了一片水潭。</p>
<p>第四天，好容易上路，到螺獅堰的時候，水雖已退去了大的部分，但沒有退净的還有將近二尺深，司機在笑——</p>
<p>——不妨事，這點水只須那麽一衝，就得。他做着手勢，眼晴估計着路面的尺寸，像前兩天，眞不成，水能壓住了氣缸，使你失去了駕馭的能力。</p>
<p>穿過那一條不很寬闊的江流，傍晚時分？停靠在江邊的車站里。這時候，繼續進行呢還是暫停在這里？大家議論着。由於公司帶過來的口信，結果，在月色朦朧的夜里走了。</p>
<p>在我們將要睡去的時候，「吱」，車子猛烈的一震停下來，突然的打擊，我們覺醒了，車夫急忙的跳下去，修理損壞的部分，呌我們的手電筒照耀着他的臉發靑，汗珠有豆子般大。四外不看見有一盞星燈，除了野虫的嘶呌外，什麽都沒有。</p>
<p>——龜兒子，全壞在這個地方！他怨恨着，把阿黃的電筒借了去，衝過前面的草地，炬火照視着草叢里。</p>
<p>——糟！糟！他回來時連連地喊，這地方呌黑牙子，時常有狼羣的出沒，再過去六七里，像你們經過的九盤子一樣，也是個險要的所在。</p>
<p>怔住了，我們不知將怎樣的處理這眼前的危險。</p>
<p>靜着氣，看着他把一根根地綫條擦着，螺旋的地方加了些油，時針從九點半直劃到十點半，終於，徼倖的把損壞的部分修理完成了。</p>
<p>——嗥嗥，嗥嗥，粗野的聲音像旋風一陣，捲着，衝過草地，的有六七頭身體高大的狼包圍過來，想從窗口跳進了車廂，我們急急用鐵尺迎擊着，使牠們不敢上來，車夫也在靈敏的搬動了機關，扭開那一雙虎眼，急駛出去！</p>
<p>一隻比較大些的，還緊緊地追隨着，不肯放鬆，而且，在跳上了車尾的橫檔。</p>
<p>——好，看我的！阿黃說，把皮套子　　拔出來，嘿！他在冷笑，——轟，一道火光，一道烟，隨了這聲音，牠從橫檔上跌下去。</p>
<p>車夫說：住在附近的人家，為了房門的不小心，時常的會把嬰兒送到牠們的嘴里。</p>
<p>——應該感謝運命的施賜吧？我們衝出了危險的包圍。</p>

<p>— 燕汀</p>
<p>在這兒我們住着的，是一條狹小而汚的弄堂。從弄堂頭跑到弄堂尾，只有二三十步路，對立着的兩小列房子，密密地擠着，方老而又破舊的。</p>
<p>有一間翻吵間，就在我們底對面，那里面住着的幾個又小又黑的小伙子，整天地在那陰暗齷齪的小工塲里，邊忙碌地工作着，邊用一種尖亮而又奇異的聲調吶笑着，嘶呌。……</p>
<p>這吶笑和嘶呌，在深夜里，有時是那麼地使我們感到厭煩，然而，沒過了若干時間。它們便會自然地熄滅，而給另一種聲音代替了。</p>
<p>我們靜寞地站着，用遲緩的眼睛，去凝視對過灰暗的窗髒。那凄切而低小的呌喊和鳴咽，常常地使我們戚到了內心的辛酸。「這像是入底呌喊嗎？不！那多柔弱得可憐啊！……」想着，我們都黯然了，眼淚在眼簾里蘊蓄着。</p>
<p>漸漸地，在那翻砂間里，一個骨格高大，身體瘦弱的中年男人，引起我們底注意了。他不時，不！幾乎是一定地，從每天早晨出去，直到深夜才回轉來。接着那幽咽和咒駡聲，便要從黑暗的窗櫺里給丟拋出來，通過隊度氣壓，透過我們這一邊來。</p>
<p>顯然地，這咽聲和咒罵是從兩個不同的嘴巴發射出來的，但是除了這個骨格高大的中年人外，我們什麽也沒有看見。翻吵間里一個小伙子，當有一天我們互相認識着時，便撈一撈他底油膩的，塗着黑油烟的小嘴巴說：</p>
<p>「三個月了，兩口子都給紗廠里歇了生意，便整天吵鬧着。……」</p>
<p>「那男子和什麼人？」我注意地問。</p>
<p>「他底女人，一個害肺病的。……」他直截地答着。</p>
<p>接着，他就天眞地，用他底裸赤的，油膩的小胳膊向我說着，描畫出她底形骸和輪廓。漸漸地，在我底眼前，有一個矮小的，病弱的，面孔靑蒼，兩頰深陷，眼睛泛着灰黃色的年靑女人底陰影，腦子里浮幌着。慢慢地，她變得淸晰而靈活起來，終於她底兩撇泛黑的嘴唐，輕輕的在抖動着，接着就發出了一陣謎樣的語調憂慮地說道：</p>
<p>「有什麽辦法呢，繅紗間里底機器把我底肺葉吞蝕了！……」</p>
<p>她底灰黃色的眼睛，就慢慢地泛出了幾顆淚珠，悄然地消失了！</p>
<p>下着細雨的一天晚上，我正在房子里不安地踱着步，一種沉重的倒跌聲，把我吸引住了，我增住傾聽，我聽見了一陣低的幽咽聲。</p>
<p>「這生活，我再也過不下去了……」接着是一陣嘔心的乾咳，咳得那麽吃力，幾乎要使人懷疑着她是滲了大量的血絲和咽聲被咳出來的。「我拖累你，我害你，那麽你就該讓我回去，在家鄉我們可以吃泥十和草根，在這兒我們却什麽也得不到。……」</p>
<p>對方沉重地嘆息着，跨着很嚮的步伐走了。</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>這異動吸引着我，使我微微地震撼着，於是，我便提緊步伐，推開門望扶梯下跑去，心里刺痛着。</p>
<p>弄堂里是寂靜的，雨在渺渺地下着，我斜眼透過細密的雨柱，向翻砂間看着，門是虛掩的，在一個靜靜的角落里，我看見一個龐小的陰影在蠕動，不時發出了悲苦的呻吟聲，「就是她，那患肺結核症的女人！」我悄悄的想着。</p>
<p>第二天那害癆病的女人，在弄堂里死了，高大的中年人也從此沒人看見。</p>
<h3 id="c214">家 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— 李文</p>
<p>——里行散記</p>
<p>到了家，覺着什麼都變了。首先令我銳威地覺察到的，就是　敗的痕跡已無可掩飾的從各個角落裏伸出脚來，顯得一切鋪張都是勉强支撑的。</p>
<p>三年，對於流浪在外面的人是匆促的；不知不覺在外面漂流了三年，回到了家，才知道這是多麼悠長的時候啊！</p>
<p>父親，蒼老多了，一種老年人的徵態已顯然地爬上了他的骨髓裏。他變得沈默，額角上繁密的皺紋裏，也有了厭倦的吐露。最令我難受的就是他的眼睛，那蘊藏着不能含蓄的喜意和憂愁的；他就那樣注視着我，不放鬆地而且無間歇地；似乎他重新獲得了失去的寶物却耽又憂着這寶物的再度失落般的。</p>
<p>母親呢，白髮已開始不留情地在她頭上停滯下來了！年前她大病了一次，左眼因此矇翳起來。現在也還沒有完全恢復健康；然而，這一切都不能阻碍她的過要的愉快，她親自忙碌起來，為我佈置臥房，一些精美的我在家時喜歡的菜餚；好像忘記了，我回來祗有短期的逞留，又好像希望我在這短期裏能够更多地舒服一下般的。</p>
<p>——對於家，我是個陌生者了啊！</p>
<p>我不安地嘆了口氣，深深地威到自己在家裏已經陌生起來了。</p>
<p>——三年！</p>
<p>我越覺這是個悠長，而且過於悠長的時間了。</p>
<p>我開始躊躇起來。我萬想不到在我是那樣短促折三年裏，一切的變化都進展得這樣利害。</p>
<p>「芸兒，你也該歇歇了，在外面塵埃樣飛了這許久——現在，難得回來了……</p>
<p>母親說若說着聲音瘠啞下去。</p>
<p>我背轉身，眼前水溜溜的迷濛起來</p>
<p>我覺得難受——幾乎想抱住母親嚎哭一番，幷且大聲地吿訴她從此我要住下，……</p>
<p>父親似乎了解我，用他那低沉的失望的聲調勉强裝着微笑說：</p>
<p>一不過，男子漢，大丈夫，本來也不是一輩子可以獃在家裏的。我說——我說，……不過幾年以來南洋的時勢不好，尼德蘭政府又有意地把巴頁（註一）提得很高……我看——這兒也不是久居的地方。現在你回來了正好，我想乘這個機會淸理一下，找個機會收手。</p>
<p>父親說這話，我知道是很吃力的。他的臉色暗沉沉地，我看他越覺老了·</p>
<p>「這外面的情形你也許不明瞭——甚」父親繼續着說：「我們中國人在這兒簡直是在上吊哩！時勢這樣冷淡，巴頁却抽得這樣高。芸兒，說起來嚇人呢！譬如，在甘監（註二）裏，一間小亞弄（註三），你想，貨物値得多少，每日裏零頭買賣，還不是仙士的交易，可是，唉！嚇人呢，巴頁却要五百多盾！（註四）小本生意這怎麽挨得下呀！索性丟下了舖子，就這樣打赤膊（註五）跑回中國去了的幾乎每期船總有幾百個呢！</p>
<p>「我們這裏的還沒有批下。那時節若有不對，這就難辦呢。我們的死貨（註六）多一時却又出不得手，眞上吊呀！</p>
<p>「所以我說你還要回去這是很好的，我們中國人終究是要回中國去的，死在自己國裏也要睡得安定多哪！——不過，我年紀老了，淸理不是一下子就鋪得淸爽的，我以為你最好能在家裏多住幾天，一來安安你母親的心，三年來她是無日無夜不在躭掛着你！二來也好帮帮我的不足。等那時節，我們就一同回去好了！……」</p>
<p>父親的話像一條鞭，鞭着我的心，每一條神經織維。一種異樣的感覺爬進了我的感官，使我窒息地受到異樣，厭抑的難受。</p>
<p>「我們……我們收手回去？……」我囁嚅地。</p>
<p>父親重重地嘆了口氣。「這又有什麽辦法呢？時勢這樣冷淡，巴頁又這樣重——唉，唉，芸兒，他們排華呢，我聽好多人說過了，尼德蘭人排華呢！………」</p>
<p>母親端過來她親手製的牛肉汁。</p>
<p>這是你最喜歡吃的呢！是不是？吃吧，我三年沒看着你吃東西了呢！…………」</p>
<p>說着說着，母親又瘠啞下去。</p>
<p>眼前，似乎又迷濛起來。——收手，巴頁，時勢冷淡，父親老了，母親也老了，排華，排華，排華……這些，牢牢地交織在我腦海裏，起始是遷緩而後是很快地旋轉起來，我覺得頭暈，我抱着頭，我倒下去——在母親懷裏。………</p>
<p>註一：巴頁卽所得稅。荷語</p>
<p>註二：甘監卽村子。八打威語。</p>
<p>註三：亞等卽小生意店子。亦八打威語。</p>
<p>註四：盾荷幣名。</p>
<p>註五：打赤膊卽光上身。意思：卽什麽都不帶就逃走了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Kawagoe Arrives in Tianjin; Japanese Military Holds Meeting; Tashiro Explains the Aims and Intentions Regarding the Current Situation; Kawagoe States the Purpose of Coming North for Negotiations; Opinions Exchanged on Various Issues; Further Meetings of Consuls-General Required <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Kawagoe Speaks of Resolving Misunderstandings Between China and Japan and Adjusting National Relations, with Economic Cooperation as the Central Issue</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Kawagoe arrived in Tianjin at 11:20 AM on the 17th via China Aviation aircraft, accompanied by secretaries Ishino and Ogiwara. He landed at the Dongjuzi Airfield, where he was welcomed by Tashiro, Wachi, Tajiri, Nagai, Nishida, Kubota, as well as the Secretary-General of our municipal government, Ma Yanchong, and the Director of the Public Security Bureau, Cheng Xixian. After disembarking, he proceeded to the Tokiwa Hotel. He subsequently met with both Chinese and Japanese journalists. At 3 PM, he went to the Haiguang Temple Barracks to attend a meeting. At 7 PM, he attended a banquet hosted by Tajiri at the Consul-General's residence in the British Concession. At 4 PM on the 18th, he will depart early for Beiping to visit Song (Zheyuan), staying for two days. On the 20th, he will return to Tianjin, and on the 22nd, a conference of consuls in North China will be convened, lasting three days. Mantetsu Director Ishimoto and Xingzhong Company President Sogo will arrive on the 19th night to participate. The consuls of Qingdao and Jinan, Zhang and Yu, are expected to arrive by the morning of the 20th. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At 3 PM on the 17th, a meeting was convened at the Tianjin Haiguang Temple, centered around Tashiro and Kawagoe. More than thirty members of the military staff, including Iida, Nakamura, Wachi, Kawabe, Matsumuro, Hamada, Imai, Nagami, etc., also participated. The meeting proceeded according to the scheduled agenda. Staff members from various departments reported on the current situation and the opinions of the economic investigation teams. Subsequently, Tashiro explained the military's aims and intentions regarding the current situation, economic cooperation, and other matters, as well as plans to promote the Hebei-Chahar political regime. Then, Kawagoe reported on the purpose of his visit to the North and the future goals for adjusting Sino-Japanese relations, as well as the negotiation steps for economic development in North China. Finally, various issues were discussed, and opinions were exchanged in detail. The meeting adjourned at 6 PM. Matsumuro, Hamada, and others are in Tianjin awaiting Hashimoto's arrival. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Kawagoe stated that he had been somewhat out of touch with the situation in North China since leaving Tianjin. This visit was specifically to interview various parties to ascertain the truth. He will return to Shanghai at the end of the month, with no fixed date for proceeding to Nanjing. Regarding economic cooperation, the Japanese side emphasizes a transportation network, including railways, waterways, and highways. The target for negotiations is the Hebei-Chahar Council. The Japanese responsible agency is not limited to the military, embassy, or consulates. If merchants require practical convenience, they may also negotiate directly. Wang Kemin was seen twice in Shanghai and is very willing to come north to assist in everything, but his travel schedule is still unknown. Since the Meiji Restoration, Japan has been seventy years in the making, achieving what it has by relying on its inherent civilization, incorporating the scientific spirit of Europe and America, and creating a mixed system, without completely forgetting its roots. Your country seems to be improving in recent years, but much of your civilization imitates Europe and America, discarding your own national spirit, resulting in a vast distance, making it difficult to catch up. Countries, like people, should learn from each other's strengths and make up for their weaknesses to maintain a lasting relationship. Your country should pay attention to this point. Currently, economic cooperation is the central issue in adjusting national relations. The Japanese side is very willing to assist your country with experience and technology to revitalize the rural areas and prosper the business community. We sincerely hope to realize this wish in North China and are willing to build a port as the basis for prosperity. The Japanese side is already preparing to negotiate tariff reductions and can discuss them at any time if the opportunity arises, but I do not know if your country is prepared for this. The North China Consuls-General Conference will be held on the 22nd, and the consuls will arrive immediately. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Kawagoe stated that misunderstandings often arise between China and Japan, and he is determined to work to eliminate them. He has not yet received information about the Suiyuan incident. He is aware that there is a large Soviet Russia in northern Japan with superior military equipment, causing constant anxiety among the Japanese people about their national defense. Although the Russo-Japanese War is in the past, the Japanese military and people are paying attention to Soviet Russia to consolidate national defense, open up roads in Inner Mongolia, and cannot ignore the disputes in northern Suiyuan. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Kawagoe arrived in Tianjin this afternoon and is scheduled to visit the local authorities in Beiping on the 18th to offer greetings after his appointment. At the same time, he will exchange views on the economic development of North China, such as the construction of the Cangshi Railway, the mining of the Longyanzhen mines in Xuanhua, and the planting of cotton, as a preliminary negotiation for economic cooperation. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Kawagoe plans to visit Han Fuqu in Jinan on the 25th and fly back to Shanghai on the 27th. On the 28th and 29th, he will hold a conference of consuls in South China and Central China to discuss the results of various consultations in Tianjin on the current situation as an important topic. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe arrived here this morning by plane from Qingdao. Many Chinese and Japanese officials welcomed him. The ambassador met with General Tashiro, commander of the Japanese Garrison Army in North China, in the afternoon. He will visit Song Zheyuan tomorrow and is scheduled to attend a conference of Japanese consuls stationed in various parts of China on August 22. (17th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Ambassador Kawagoe arrived here by plane from Qingdao at 11 AM this morning. He visited Commander Tashiro in the afternoon to exchange views. The ambassador is scheduled to go to Beiping tomorrow and return to Tianjin on the 20th to convene a consular conference. (17th Domei Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Major Senda, the newly appointed staff officer of the Japanese Tianjin Garrison, Major Iwamoto, a teacher at the Commercial School, and First-Class Pharmacist Hirata arrived on the 17th to take office. The North China General Consuls Conference will simultaneously discuss two issues: the expansion of police power in North China and the expansion of the organization of the Tianjin Consulate.

<p>(Beiping) Information from relevant sources: (1) There have been no changes on the border between Chahar and Suiyuan in recent days, but the situation remains tense. It is reported that the puppet Mongolian bandit troops, led by a certain Wang as the vanguard and Li Shouxin's puppet army as the rearguard, appear to be preparing to invade eastern Suiyuan again. (2) Our army in eastern Suiyuan is extremely well-equipped and has constructed solid fortifications. All patrols and sentries are taking measures as if in a state of emergency. The Suiyuan army's units under Zeng Yan, Yi Peng, and Bin Yu, are in close contact with the Mongolian army of Damilin and Sulong, possessing formidable strength. Camps stretch for hundreds of miles, with watchtowers echoing each other. If the bandit troops invade, they can be annihilated in one fell swoop. (17th Central News Agency)</p>

<h3 id="e7">Two Memorial Weeks at the Central Government <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Reports Given by Wu Jingheng and Ye Chucang Respectively</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held its 37th Memorial Week at 8 AM on the 17th. Attendees included Central Committee members Wu Jingheng, Fang Zhi, Zhang Lisheng, Zhou Qigang, He Yingqin, Gu Zhenglun, Li Zonghuang, Shao Hua, Gan Naiguang, Mei Gongren, Zhao Yunyi, Wang Yongbin, and others, as well as all staff members, totaling 700 people. Wu Jingheng presided over the meeting and gave a report, stating that the ancients said that there are two major events in establishing a country: sacrifice and war, namely, worship and the military. Modern nation-building should only piously uphold the doctrine and the national system, which is a transformed version of the ancient sacrifice. As for war, namely the military, it is still a major companion event in current nation-building. The military should be unified, just like the national system and doctrine, to hope for strength, long-term stability, and security. Now, the national system is the Republic of China, and the doctrine is the Three Principles of the People, which have already been determined and are unchangeable. However, the military still retains the idea of ​​holding onto soldiers for self-interest, not understanding the essence of unification. Therefore, a few comrades have forgotten the Prime Minister's model, resulting in mistakes. In the early years of the Republic, the Prime Minister entrusted the President (i.e., the national system) and the military to Yuan Shikai, and he himself went to implement industrial plans. Soon Yuan Shikai despised the doctrine and openly betrayed the country. The Prime Minister had not yet lightly trained soldiers until later when the national system existed in name only and the doctrine was about to perish. The Huangpu Military Academy trained a true central army. The Prime Minister was so cautious because he wanted to keep it unified forever. From then on, would anyone dare to create an army outside of the central army? Therefore, everyone should only learn from the Prime Minister's model, show spirit, and realize the Prime Minister's industrial plans to increase national production, and so on. After Wu's speech, the meeting adjourned. (17th Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held its Memorial Week at 9 AM on the 17th.

<h3 id="e9">Establishment of a Non-Intervention Agreement by Britain and France <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>Recently, the internal strife in Spain has been unusually severe. Germany and Italy have been providing extensive assistance to the rebel forces, while France and the Soviet Union have been showing strong sympathy to the Madrid government. This internal strife in one corner of the Mediterranean Sea threatens to escalate into a struggle between a pan-European Francoist front and an anti-Francoist front. To avoid this human tragedy, the French government proposed a non-intervention agreement, advocating that all signatory nations should not sell any military supplies, military or civilian aircraft, or any warships to Spain or Spanish Morocco. Britain and France have already exchanged notes in Paris. If the governments of Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, and Portugal agree to participate and the agreement comes into effect, not only will the war in Spain not be prolonged, but it will also create a good precedent in international custom for non-intervention in the internal strife of neighboring countries, benefiting peace in no small measure.</p>
<p>From a principled perspective, a sovereign government has absolute control over its country's people and land. Any neighboring country has no right to comment on the form the government takes. Directly or indirectly interfering in another country is not only an unfriendly act but also prohibited by international law. Supplying military supplies to fuel internal strife is even more of a crime against humanity. Since the Xinhai Revolution, every internal strife in our country has had foreign arms merchants as a backdrop, supplying military supplies to the rebel forces, either with political intentions or purely for profit. The result has been to undermine unity, increase carnage, and disrupt peace. Spanish diplomat Madariaga, discussing the China problem, once said emphatically that the day European, American, and Japanese arms merchants cease their activities in China will be the day China is unified and East Asia is at peace. What Madariaga said about China is now applicable to his own country. From a moral and legal perspective, the non-intervention agreement should be supported by people all over the world, and the principle of this agreement is sufficient to serve as a guide for future international relations.</p>
<p>However, from a technical perspective, the non-intervention agreement has many difficult problems that are not easy to solve. International law is still in its infancy, and past customs are largely inconsistent with human ideals. According to custom, neutral countries cannot, in their capacity as states and governments, favor any belligerent group, but the actions of individual citizens of neutral countries, such as demonstrations, newspaper propaganda, donations, and joining the military, are not obligated for neutral governments to stop. If arms trade is a private business, it is not appropriate for the government to ban it. Although the legislation of various countries has slightly improved on this point, as far as Britain is concerned, the British government still has no right to prohibit the trade of aircraft. Moreover, the distinction between military supplies and non-military supplies is very subtle. Cotton, steel, kerosene, and rubber are all essential for military supplies but are not usually regarded as prohibited items in wartime. Moreover, the rebels in Spain have not yet been recognized as belligerent groups. Many countries do not feel obligated to be neutral. Even if an agreement is reached, those who do not join the agreement can greatly benefit from commercial interests. Therefore, whether the agreement is accepted by all parties still requires a long period of negotiation. Whether it is possible to reverse the dangerous situation with just one piece of paper is something we should not be overly optimistic about.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Implementation Details of Income Tax to be Discussed by the Executive Yuan Today <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>

Deputy Director Liang Jingchun of the office is still staying in Lushan for consultation. If the review can be completed, it can be submitted to the Executive Yuan's regular meeting on the 18th for discussion, so that it can be promulgated and implemented before the tax collection begins on September 1st. As for the Review Committee that should be organized according to the Provisional Income Tax Act to determine the tax amount of taxpayers, the office has drafted its organizational regulations and submitted them to Minister Kong for the Executive Yuan to approve. Other relevant forms, books, and receipt formats are also being rushed to be produced separately by the office. Furthermore, Gao gave a detailed report at the Ministry of Finance's Memorial Week on the morning of the 17th regarding the implementation of the income tax, which was the content of the "Central Government's Announcement to the Citizens of the Whole Country on Implementing the Income Tax", divided into four sections: the meaning of income tax, the reasons for implementing income tax, the methods of collecting income tax, and the understanding that citizens should have of income tax, and elaborated on them. Finally, he hoped that citizens would hold the following concepts during the implementation of income tax: 1. To completely abolish exorbitant taxes, income tax must be promoted. 2. Income tax is the most fair and good tax. 3. Income tax is levied on income, and no tax is levied on those without income. 4. Those who can pay income tax are capable citizens. 5. Those who earn money pay, those who earn more pay more, and those who earn nothing pay nothing. 6. China's income tax rate is the lightest compared to other countries. The rich only save a little waste, and the poor can reduce unfair burdens. 7. Implementing income tax is to realize the Prime Minister's last wish. 8. Implementing income tax is to seek to enrich the national treasury and prepare for restoration and self-improvement. (17th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The lineup of Japanese diplomacy towards Russia has been refreshed with the appointment of Former Resolution Officer Shigemitsu and the transfer of Attaché Sakō to Russia. Foreign Minister Arita plans to take this opportunity to ask the new and old ambassadors to Russia and the heads of the army and navy to review Japan's diplomatic policy towards Russia and decide on the policy to be adopted in the future based on Ambassador Ohta's report. According to Ambassador Ohta's report, the Soviet Russian government still does not abandon its hope for a Japanese-Russian non-aggression treaty four years ago and proposes this issue whenever the opportunity arises. Furthermore, it is actively strengthening its military preparations in the Far East. Regarding the issue of determining the Russian-Manchukuo border, the Russian side only expressed some sincerity. As for revising fisheries and other issues, it did not express a friendly attitude. Although Soviet Russian Defense Commissar Voroshilov stated that Soviet Russia has no intention of challenging, this statement did not have any impact on the Japanese people. Therefore, although the fundamental spirit of Japan's future policy towards Russia will not change, it will seek to open up the current diplomatic situation between the two countries and develop its situation. (17th Allied News Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Japan's fundamental diplomatic policy towards the Soviet Union is now being carefully reviewed on the occasion of Ambassador Ohta's return home. As a result of the meeting of the three ministries of Foreign Affairs, Army, and Navy, the basic tone of Japanese diplomacy towards the Soviet Union, which is to solve the pending issues such as the Soviet-Manchukuo border issue and Japanese-Soviet fisheries negotiations first, and at the same time demand the withdrawal of the 300,000 Red Army concentrated in the Far East, will be the main focus, so this matter is extremely important. (17th Allied News Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Ohta returned to his country on the 13th of this month, he visited Prime Minister Hirota at his official residence on the 17th and reported in detail on the recent relations between European countries and the Soviet Union, Soviet industry and national defense, especially the Soviet Union's military preparations in the Far East, the Soviet government's feelings towards Japan, the Soviet-Manchukuo border issue, and Soviet-Mongolian relations, and made important suggestions regarding Japan's policy towards the Soviet Union. (17th Allied News Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Ohta, returned to Tokyo, the newspapers carried his remarks, saying, "Japan places its relations with the Soviet Union at the center of its entire diplomatic policy, shouting that the Soviet Union threatens the Far East, while the Soviet Union's attitude towards Japan is quite calm. Soviet responsible leaders have stated that the Soviet Union is not in a provocative position towards any power, whether now or in the future. They feel that there is no problem between the Soviet Union and Japan that can only be resolved by force. The Soviet Union's participation in the League of Nations has been an obvious success, and the Soviet Union's friendship with Britain has also been a great achievement." Ohta will meet with Foreign Minister Arita to report in detail on the Soviet situation and make some suggestions for improving Japanese-Soviet relations. (16th TASS Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to semi-official sources, the basic points of the policy towards the Soviet Union recently decided by the Foreign Affairs, Army, and Navy Ministers' Conference are to resolve various pending issues and not to advocate concluding a non-aggression treaty as a prerequisite for other negotiations. Japan will also demand that the Soviet Union withdraw the 300,000 troops stationed in the Far East, in other words, (1) the Red Army within a certain distance from the Manchurian border should be withdrawn, and (2) a demilitarized zone should be established in accordance with the spirit of the Portsmouth Treaty. As for the issue of permanent peace in the Far East, it should be discussed after the above points are negotiated. Regarding the future of Japanese-Soviet negotiations to resolve pending issues, the responsible parties also acknowledge that problems such as border conflicts, boundary affairs, fisheries, and oil are difficult to eliminate.

<p>(Nanjing) Finance Minister Baba visited Prime Minister Hirota at 10:50 AM today. Regarding the preliminary work for deciding national policy, he had conducted individual consultations with each minister other than the military ministers. He reported the details of these consultations and, based on their results, presented his future policy directions, requesting the Prime Minister's consideration. The Prime Minister immediately approved the Ministry of Finance's recommendations to determine the fundamental national policy. Therefore, the Finance Minister will soon meet with Army Minister Terauchi, Navy Minister Nagano, and others to understand the military's intentions and seek their understanding. Simultaneously, the three top cabinet officials will make further efforts to reach a compromise with relevant cabinet members. The fundamental direction of the national policy has been largely agreed upon as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Each ministry must compile a budget summary that aligns with revenue plans to determine national policy.</p>
<p>(2) National policy decisions must prioritize national defense spending.</p>
<p>(3) Broadly defined national defense issues, such as fuel policies, must be resolved in favor of national defense.</p>
<p>(4) Rural issues related to local financial allocations and national insurance policies, which contribute to stabilizing people’s livelihood, must be respected.</p>
<p>(5) Trade policies that promote industry should be implemented within the limits of available revenue. (17th, Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance's review of each ministry's important national policies is nearly complete due to Finance Minister Baba's individual consultations with each ministry's ministers. The first step of preparatory work is completed. Prime Minister Hirota plans to meet with Finance Minister Baba around the 18th to decide on the highest-level guidelines for selecting important national policies. As a result of the Finance Minister's negotiations with each ministry's ministers in recent days, a mutual understanding has been reached. The Ministry of Finance will provide a massive amount of 150 million yuan to fund each ministry’s important national policies (excluding the Army and Navy) and general new projects. Therefore, the national policy issues are likely to be resolved satisfactorily. It is reported that the government has decided to categorize the national policy proposals submitted by each ministry into two types: important national policies and important new facilities. The general outline is as follows: (A) Important National Policy Matters:</p>
<p>(1) The Ministry of Interior's institutionalization of the local finance grant system and national health policy.</p>
<p>(2) The Ministry of Education's proposed reform of the compulsory education system.</p>
<p>(3) The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's debt restructuring plan for rural areas.</p>
<p>(4) The Ministry of Commerce and Industry's fuel policy and trade policy.</p>
<p>(5) The Ministry of Communications' nationalization of electricity and aviation policies.</p>
<p>(B) Important New Facility Matters:</p>
<p>(1) The Ministry of Interior's five-year civil engineering plan.</p>
<p>(2) The Ministry of Justice's regulation and facilities improvement.</p>
<p>(3) The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's disaster insurance and merino sheep policy.</p>
<p>(4) The Ministry of Commerce and Industry's small and medium enterprise assistance plan.</p>
<p>(5) The Ministry of Communications' maritime policy.</p>
<p>(6) The Ministry of Colonial Affairs' immigration plan for Manchuria. (17th, Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Prime Minister Hirota is scheduled to discuss national policy issues with Finance Minister Baba around the 18th. The government has already established the principles of strengthening national defense, establishing fiscal stability, promoting industry and trade, and stabilizing the people's livelihood as the foundation for deciding national policy. Regarding the reform of administrative structure, the Army advocates establishing an organization to plan, control, and coordinate national policy in place of the existing Investigation Bureau, appointing its head as a minister without portfolio. It also strongly advocates establishing a new Ministry of Aviation to promote the civil aviation industry. However, Prime Minister Hirota's attitude is negative. He believes there is no need to reorganize the Investigation Bureau and appoint a minister without portfolio, and that civil aviation issues can be resolved by expanding the Aviation Bureau of the Ministry of Communications. (17th, Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) In order to cope with the international situation after the expiration of the naval treaties next year and to ensure the stability of national defense, the initial-year budget request estimate for the new national defense enhancement plan was finalized on the 17th. After Navy Minister Nagano approved it that day, it was submitted to the Ministry of Finance. The required expenses for the Navy's new national defense enhancement plan, which includes the construction of urgently needed capital ship replacements, auxiliary warships, and the increase of air squadrons, amount to 1 billion yuan, which is a regular request for a five-year continuous project. Further plans will be formulated and requested later after considering the development of the international situation and other factors. The Navy's budget estimate request for next year, including the initial-year expenses required for the new military enhancement plan, totals 770 million yuan, including a base budget of 430 million yuan and a new request of 340 million yuan.

<p>Yosemite, California, USA. The Pacific Society continued its meeting today. American expert Locke Owe declared at the conference that the Roosevelt administration's commercial policy is not inclined towards economic self-sufficiency in pursuit of economic independence during wartime.

<h3 id="e42">American Invention: High-Speed Torpedo Boat <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Stamford, Connecticut, USA. A new type of torpedo boat, 50 feet long, 13 feet wide, and 10 feet deep, with a hull painted in silver and red, recently underwent final trials in this port. Its speed exceeds that of any warship. The boat has four engines with a total of 1,200 horsepower, a speed of 50 miles per hour, and agile maneuverability, making it the latest weapon of the United States. This boat was originally a type of lifeboat, but it is said that it can be converted into a torpedo boat for night attacks on enemy ships. It can accommodate four crew members, and each side can carry two tons of torpedoes. No cannon or machine gun can sink this boat. The boat can also be carried on top of capital ships and launched at any time like an airplane to attack enemy ships within 300 miles, and it can escape from the enemy ship's range within minutes after launching torpedoes.

<p>Madrid. The Spanish Civil War has lasted for a month since it broke out, but the war is becoming increasingly fierce and there is no sign of ending. This morning, the rebels continued to attack San Sebastian. Three convoys of trucks loaded with soldiers, guns, and ammunition advanced. The rebel cruisers Canaries, Hispania, and Cervantes were also planning to join the attack and bombard the highlands in the city, but they were unsuccessful due to heavy fog and bombing by government aircraft. The rebels hope to isolate San Sebastian so that the government forces will withdraw on their own, allowing them to attack. Generals Franco and Mola, who led the Badajoz area, ordered their troops to avoid bombardment within the possible range when occupying larger cities. However, if the government forces refuse to withdraw, the rebels will bombard San Sebastian from both land and sea. The government forces in the city have gathered on the highlands to prepare for the enemy. (16th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Elvas, Portugal. Our reporter reports that it has been two days since the fall of Badajoz, and the tragic scene is still very touching. Old women and young women went to the prison to visit, hoping to know if their beloved sons or husbands were among the prisoners before the city fell. At this time, all the teenagers in the city who were able to survive the chaos, or were imprisoned and not executed, were conscripted by the authorities, incorporated into the team, and driven to the front lines to fight. Therefore, the war atmosphere still permeates the city. Last night, a column composed of Moroccan regular troops and miscellaneous troops, divided into several large trucks, drove to the city of Mérida. The outside of the trucks was decorated with huge and unparalleled religious images, which was laughable. Another column had already been opened to aid north and planned to attack Extremadura province. (17th, Havas)</p>
<p>Hendaye, France. According to news from the border between France and Spain, fierce battles have taken place between Spanish government troops and rebels in the border area. The war situation throughout Spain is also extremely fierce, but both sides claim victory, and it is impossible to know the truth. At 7:20 p.m. tonight, a Spanish plane suddenly flew over the village of Behobia, which belongs to France on the Spanish border. It dropped three bombs on the village, one of which hit a farmhouse, destroying the house. Four farmers were playing cards in the house and were not injured, which is also amazing. It is not yet clear whether this plane belongs to the Spanish government forces or the rebels. Local officials have begun an investigation in order to file a protest. Also, at 6 p.m. yesterday afternoon, the rebel cruiser "España" was seen passing the French territory of this port and heading towards the city of San Sebastian. It is not yet reported whether it will bombard the city. However, it is known that the cruiser and another rebel destroyer "Velasco" bombarded the port of Bilbao yesterday, and were very successful.

Several hundred rebel prisoners are being held in the fortress. In retaliation, the government forces have executed most of the prisoners. According to our reporter, the target of the "España's" bombardment was not the fortress, because in addition to the prisoners, it also contained a large amount of ammunition, which would explode if hit. Another rebel destroyer "Velasco" bombarded the port of Santoña. A shell landed in a kerosene pool near the port of Bilbao, immediately starting a fire. According to official Spanish news, the government forces have recovered the city of Somorrostro. The People's Front newspaper also reported that the situation of the rebels in the city of Oviedo is deteriorating. Colonel Aranda, the leader, has handed over his power to Lieutenant Colonel Caballer. Most officers protested in disagreement. News from Ciudad Rodrigo said that the city has been without electricity for several days. All banks have been closed, and public utilities have gone on strike. Therefore, the rebel situation is becoming increasingly unsustainable. (17th, Havas)</p>
<p>Hendaye, France. The fate of the 700 political prisoners of the Fascist Party in San Sebastian is said to be hopeless today. Because the government forces warned the rebels that they would destroy the city with landmines and kill all the prisoners, refusing to surrender. However, the rebels ignored the warning and continued to bombard the city. The mayor of the city asked Madrid for help today, claiming that 200 government soldiers had been killed and 500 injured by the bombardment. (16th, Guomin News Agency)</p>

After Badajoz was occupied by the rebels, Colonel Yagüe, commander of the Foreign Legion, came here to inspect and said that there were many killings in this battle, but now it is peaceful and there are no traces of communists in the city. According to reports, when the rebels attacked on Thursday, 2,500 people were divided into three teams and approached the city walls. The government forces were all perched on the city walls and firing downwards. The rebels then bombarded the city walls with artillery and launched a direct charge, succeeding one after another, and finally achieved victory. After entering the city, the rebels recovered 3,000 rifles, several artillery pieces, and many machine guns. Today, Moorish troops escorted many batches of communists through the city.

<p>(London) Regarding the non-intervention agreement in the Spanish Civil War, which Britain and France have already reached a compromise on, Germany and Italy have yet to provide a concrete response. The British Chargé d'affaires in Italy, Mr. Ingrams, visited the Italian Foreign Minister, Count Ciano, this afternoon, urging him to respond promptly. The British Ambassador to Germany will also make similar representations to the German Foreign Ministry in the coming days. In addition, according to semi-official sources, the Spanish Ambassador to Britain, Mr. Oliven, visited Acting Foreign Minister Lord Halifax this morning to discuss the Spanish government's proposed plan, which involves sending representatives to various European countries to prove to their governments that certain countries are indeed cooperating with the Spanish rebels. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) Whether the non-intervention agreement in the Spanish Civil War can be established now hinges solely on the word of Germany and Italy. According to sources in official circles here, the British government made further contact with the German government today to echo the suggestions made by France. Similar representations have also been made to Italy recently, but a response from that country has not yet been received. Political figures deeply fear that the French government, due to the deliberate delays of the fascist countries, may take independent action. If that happens, an international dispute between the fascist countries and the left-wing Popular Front countries may occur in Spain. Furthermore, conservatives are deeply distressed by the Red Terror and are not without animosity towards the left-wing government in Spain. Therefore, although Britain and France are currently working together on the Spanish issue, it is still questionable whether they can maintain this cooperation in the long term. This is what political figures fear. Therefore, the British government is now continuously engaging with Germany and Italy, hoping that the non-intervention agreement can be concluded as soon as possible, so that the international gloom can be swept away.

<h3 id="e65">Song Zheyuan Returns to Beiping from Baoding, Inspecting Various Counties to Rectify Officialdom and Combining Facts with the National Assembly Election in Hebei and Chahar <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Song Zheyuan, Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, left Beiping for Baoding on the 4th of this month and inspected Renqiu and other places. He finally returned to Beiping by special train at 6 p.m. on the 15th. All heads of agencies went to the station to greet him. That evening, Song summoned the leaders of various agencies at his private residence in Wuyiku, inquiring about military and political affairs. Zhang Zizhong and Chen Juesheng also came to Beiping from Tianjin on the 16th to pay their respects and report on everything. According to Song, the course of this trip was roughly as follows: "The Hebei Provincial Security Office held a security conference this time. All counties considered the situation, and the county magistrate, the head of the public security bureau, or the deputy commander of the security brigade attended in Baoding. More than 100 people attended. The meeting was scheduled to end on the 4th, and everyone should return. Because it was not easy to gather, I stayed for another half day after arriving in Baoding on the evening of the 4th. On the morning of the 5th, I invited them to give a speech. The content of the speech was published in a booklet. The most important thing is to strictly prohibit opium. Because the ban on opium must start from the fundamental prohibition of planting. In the past, due to incorrect policies, it was not possible to thoroughly ban it. Therefore, all opium investigation offices in various counties have been cancelled. In the future, anyone who opens a lamp (for opium smoking) or sells opium will be treated as a bandit once caught. Then I inspected the troops stationed in Baoding and tested the officers' academic and martial arts skills. Later, I went to Renqiu to watch officers above the company commander level practice shooting. Because in the army, if the officers are proficient in academic subjects, the soldiers will also be proficient. This decision to go on inspection was originally intended to visit many counties, but after arriving in Renqiu, it rained heavily that night, and it rained again the next day, so I didn't go to many places. The purpose of the inspection is to rectify officialdom and clear up backlogged cases. Renqiu County alone has many backlogged cases. Among them, there is a deserter detained by a certain army whose name has not yet been decided. Such cases are common in various counties. Generally, after the troops stationed in an area leave, no one cares about the prisoners. The cost of prisoner rations in Hebei Province alone reaches more than two million yuan a year. Clearing up backlogged cases is very important. An order has been issued to all counties in the province to clear up all military cases from now on. In addition, the Cangxian County Magistrate was punished for dereliction of duty, and the Jinghai and Yanshan County Magistrates were punished for not reporting bandits and beautifying peace. The Daxing County Magistrate was punished for violating orders and apportioning money. At the same time, the previous order was reiterated that from the 25th year (of the Republic), no apportionment is absolutely allowed. During this time in Baoding, it was decided to absolutely and thoroughly implement two things this year: one is to reorganize the additional taxes in the province. In the future, the additional tax on land tax shall not exceed four yuan at most. The other is to rectify the people's militia security team. The first step is to eliminate the bandits and people who disturb the people in the team. The second step is to train and organize them. After these two steps are done, then stipulate the methods for the security team to go to the countryside to support themselves. Now, everything that is being done is aimed at relieving the suffering of the people. There has always been a gap between officials and the people. I believe that whatever the people need, we must actively promote it. Whatever the people consider painful, we must quickly relieve it. Only in this way can we eliminate the gap. The harvest in Hebei Province this year, as it stands now, can reach 70-80%. If it rains again, we can expect a full harvest." In addition to the above remarks, Mr. Song also answered several questions from reporters, which are recorded below: (1) The recent small disturbances in Suiyuan are caused by Mongolian bandits and puppet troops on the border of Chahar and Suiyuan. But these troops are all a rabble, and those who help them dare not say so clearly. Moreover, the Suiyuan army has a very strong combat capability, and the bandits are not worth a single blow. I believe this matter will not lead to any major changes. (2) Whether the Japanese ambassador to China came to the north this time to be responsible for contacting the development of the North China economy was not reported in advance. (3) There is no definite date for Wang Kemin's arrival in the north. The matter of taking office as the chairman of the Economic Committee has not been discussed recently. The issue of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation in North China has not been negotiated recently either. (4) The construction of the Cangshi Road is the request of others. I intend to accept local investment. Under the principle of fairness and mutual benefit, it is also possible to purchase its materials. However, if it is still insisted on priority, it will be very difficult. (5) Regarding the election of delegates to the National Assembly in Hebei Province, we should take into account the facts and not affect the overall situation as a prerequisite. It is not yet certain whether it will be circled and sent by the central government in the future. (16th)</p>
<h3 id="e66">Puppet Troops Active in Northern Chahar; De Wang to Organize Security Team into a Division; Zhang Haipeng's Troops Flee from Rehe to Baochang; Japanese Automobile Company Manipulates Commerce <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Zhangjiakou Correspondence: The puppet troops in northern Chahar are actively expanding. According to transportation sources, De Wang is still in Jiabusi (i.e., Jiapu Temple). He is currently gathering the security teams of the six counties in northern Chahar, gathering them in Jiapu Temple, and organizing them into a division, totaling more than 3,000 people. The guns and uniforms are also quite neat, and he is asking a certain party to issue military pay and train them. However, a certain party is only responsible for training and does not provide military pay, which is still raised by De Wang himself. Yuan Dupeng holds an important position in the expansion of the division. Yuan previously served as the captain of the security team in northern Chahar. He is extremely sinister. All merchants in northern Chahar know his name. His mother is Korean, and his father is Chinese. He has a lot of contact with a certain party. Now, all the bandits in northern Chahar feel that they are oppressed internally by a certain party and have no possibility of development externally, and they all intend to turn against them.</p>
<p>The bandit army of Zhang Haipeng's department, with more than 2,000 people, has already arrived in Baochang County in northern Chahar from Rehe and is still continuing to move westward. It will join forces with the bandit gangs of Wang Ying and Wang Daoyi in Shangdu to attack Suiyuan. The military supplies are completely supplied by a certain party. In addition, 500 people from the puppet army of Li Shouxin's department in Zhangbei have arrived in the Kangbao area of Shangdu. De Wang held an important meeting with 11 puppet military and political figures such as Bao Yueqing in Jiabusi. One theory is to join forces with Wang Ying, Li Shouxin, Wang Daoyi, and Zhang Haipeng to attack Suiyuan. Another theory is to take considerable contact with the Suiyuan army to solve the bandit army. It is still waiting for confirmation. Suo Wang still lives in Zhangbei, and there is no news of leaving Zhangbei recently.</p>
<p>After the puppet army occupied northern Chahar, except for the Dabe, Wenlin, and Donglu three automobile companies operated by certain nationals, which can pass freely, the other automobiles have been successively shut down. The transportation of goods is also contracted by these three companies. Recently, the organization of the Great Mongolian Company has been restored to manipulate the general hub of commerce in northern Chahar. All goods dumped by a certain party in northern Chahar are transported to northern Chahar by the Great Mongolian Company from the eastern provinces via Rehe. The national goods sold in northern Chahar are also rented by the Great Mongolian Company in Zhangjiakou with automobiles with the flags of a certain country inserted on them and transported to the north. The commerce operated by the Chinese in northern Chahar is now in a state of extreme panic. (14th)</p>
<h3 id="e67">Huai Bei Salt Industry Bankrupt; Salt Merchants Petition to the Ministry of Finance; Shanghai Banking Circle Agrees to Loan 3 Million; Contract to Be Signed After Salt Price Balance <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Haizhou Correspondence: Northern Huai is a salt-producing area, and Banpu is the administrative area in the center of Northern Huai. Auditors, salt fields, and merchants are all concentrated here. In recent years, due to the impact of the current situation and natural disasters, salt production has been reduced, and transportation and sales have been sluggish. At the national level, the tax revenue has decreased. At the salt field and merchant level, not only is life in a state of panic, but the salt worker fees are also difficult to maintain. Salt workers want to produce but have no one to rely on, and they cry bitterly all day long. In particular, the drop in salt prices exceeds the drop rate of ordinary agricultural products. Salt is a daily necessity, and its cost of assets and labor are the same as agricultural affairs. The rise and fall of market prices should also be at the same rate. Now, the market prices of ordinary agricultural products, such as rice and wheat, have fallen by 30% to 35% compared with five years ago, and it is generally recognized that there is an urgent need for relief. However, the drop rate of salt prices has exceeded 50%, which is contrary to the normal degree of economic curves. Recently, the cost of salt production has exceeded the market price significantly. If the salt price drops and the cost is reduced accordingly, it is still possible to offset each other. However, the government sends a field affairs officer to each number of salt fields, and raises the treatment of laborers, salt worker rations, and labor costs, etc., which increase year by year. Since the construction of Guantuo in the 22nd year, salt production must be carried out in a limited period of time. Each number also increases the cost of lightering salt, signing seats, sacks, hooking, and carrying, etc., by more than fifty yuan, so that the cost of each number of salt is more than 270 yuan. Compared with the current market price, each number of salt loses fifty or sixty yuan. Most of the salt fields and merchants have no ability to produce salt. In addition, the banking circle has stopped issuing loans, so all the salt merchants in Northern Huai are in a desperate situation. A petition group for increasing mortgage prices and borrowing money in Northern Huai was recently organized to petition to the Ministry of Finance and the Lianghuai Transportation Envoy's Office, and went to Shanghai to negotiate a loan. As a result, the Shanghai banking circle agreed to lend 3 million yuan. Petition representatives Qiu Menglin, Luo Fangbo, and Li Yangren, etc., returned from Shanghai to report the results of the petition and remove the salt affairs official Hong Man. The Preparatory Office of the Huai Bei Salt Industry Association was reorganized and formally elected members of the supervisory committee to establish a formal Salt Industry Association. The original representatives were still elected to go to Shanghai again to carry out the loan work. Soon Luo Fangbo returned from Shanghai to the association and reported that the loan of 3 million yuan had a definite grasp. This time, he returned to Pu on the order of the Shanghai banking circle, specializing in handling the formalities for balancing salt prices in the association. Once the handling is completed, he will go to Shanghai to handle the signing. The Salt Industry Association has properly balanced the salt prices in Northern Huai and submitted them to the Liang Huai Transportation Envoy's Office for review. Once approved, Luo will go to Shanghai again.</p>

<p>Expanding School Buildings in the County</p>
<p>Muyi County Middle School has developed greatly in recent years, but the school buildings are limited, and there is almost a problem of overcrowding. Xia Zhongfang, who lives next door to the school, is a famous doctor in the county and is very enthusiastic about education. He believes that the county middle school has made great achievements in cultivating young people, so he completely donated his own residence and newly built houses. After receiving the donation, the school not only published a thank-you notice in the newspaper to promote his benevolence, but also built dormitories and dining halls on the land donated by the Xia family, and demolished and rebuilt the auditorium to make it more spectacular.</p>

<p>Cart Driver Mutual Assaults Lead to Fatal Incident</p>
<p>Wang Da, a resident of No. 13 Hongling Lane in Pingmen, Funing, made a living pulling rickshaws. At 4 pm on the 16th, near the Chanxing Temple Bridge on Hulong Street, he had a conflict with a fellow rickshaw driver over robbing business. He even assaulted Wang Da, who was seriously injured. The perpetrator saw that he had caused trouble and immediately slipped away. Wang Da still pulled the rickshaw with pain after being injured, but he collapsed in front of the Tianfu Tea House. The police station sent him to the County Hospital for treatment, but he died at the entrance of the hospital. His wife, Zhang, learned the details and asked the police district to arrest the murderer and investigate the case. The District Prosecutor's Office sent staff to inspect the scene at noon on the 17th, ordered the family to collect the body, and strictly arrested the murderer to bring him to justice.</p>

<p>Implementing the Police Management District System</p>
<p>Zhang Da, the Director of the Public Security Bureau of Wuxi County, officially took office on the 15th. All the staff in the bureau and the directors, inspectors, and officers of the nine branch bureaus and eight branch offices in the urban and rural areas must receive considerable training because this county has been designated by the Department of Civil Affairs to change to the police management district system. Except for Li Junjian, Min Junzhong, and Jin Wu, the other three were all replaced. This time, 36 police officers who graduated from the Provincial Police School were commissioned and arrived in Wuxi from the province the day before yesterday. After a rest, they went to various branch bureaus and offices to serve. In addition, 181 police officers also arrived in Wuxi from the province the day before yesterday and were sent to various bureaus and offices to work on the same day. Director Zhang originally intended to implement the police management district system in this county. All police officers in the branch bureaus and offices must pass the examination. The excellent ones will be sent to the province for training to transport the considerable knowledge of the liquid police management district system. Yesterday morning, he specially ordered the six branch bureaus in the urban area to transfer a part of the police to the bureau, and Director Zhang, together with the police supervisors of the Civil Affairs Department, examined the academic and martial arts skills and gave a speech to determine the selection and dismissal.</p>
<p>It was also reported that the new Director of the Public Security Bureau, Zhang Da, took office on the 15th, and on the 16th, he ordered the removal of the directors of the six branch bureaus in the urban area and the three branch bureaus in the rural area, and also replaced all the inspectors of the branch bureaus. 232 elderly police officers were laid off in the bureaus. 29 police officers and 184 trained police officers were sent by the Jiangsu Provincial Government to serve in the bureaus. The laid-off police officers were scheduled to take an examination on the 18th, and 181 were prepared for recruitment and transferred to the province for training. The police officers in the bureaus were very panicked when they heard this news. Suddenly, at about 10 pm last night, they all went on strike and decided to go to the county government to petition tomorrow (18th). Zhang Da immediately led more than 100 police officers to suppress the situation in various places after receiving the report.</p>
<p>Certain Nationals Buy Up Rice Bran</p>
<p>The rice bran of each rice mill has been sold to various counties in Jiangbei to be used as fertilizer and duck feed. This year, due to the bumper harvest in Jiangbei, the sales volume is very small, so each factory has a large stock. However, in the past few days, the price of bran has suddenly soared, rising by 3-4 cents per stone compared with usual. The reason is that certain nationals specially entrusted the Tianjin gang to buy it in Wuxi for oil extraction, so in the past few days, more than 10,000 dan of bran stored in each factory have been sold out.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Robbery Case Solved Quickly <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>The home of Wang Ruyuan, a grain merchant at No. 2 Lime Field in Beizhakou, Muyi, was robbed by five bandits at about 11 pm on the 15th, claiming to be delivering express mail to Suzhou. They robbed 943 yuan in paper money, 3 flower hairpins, 9 pieces of silverware, and 2 gold rings, totaling more than 1,000 yuan. It is now known that the public security authorities paid unusual attention to this case after it occurred. The perpetrator of this case was Yao Ayu, the shop assistant from Changchunyu Rice Shop under the Huinong Bridge. The rice shop was also opened by Wang Ruyuan. Ayu was a substitute worker of a certain person. Because he coveted the wealth of the shop owner, he gathered a group of accomplices, including Shen Hongsheng and Yin Zhongliang, and went to rob. The next day, Wang Bingsheng and Dai Quan, the detectives of the Public Security Bureau's Detective Team, captured Yao Ayu based on confidential reports. Then they captured the two criminals Shen and Yin, and arrested Shen's mother, Li, at No. 25 Xinfangs Community, and found the original stolen goods such as hairpins, paper money, and gold rings. They were all taken to the team and interrogated strictly. The criminals confessed to robbing Wang's house without any concealment. They were all handed over to the Public Security Bureau for review on the 17th.</p>

<p>600,000 Citizens Sworn in</p>
<p>The citizens of Wuyi County were ordered to complete the registration of the oath by the 15th of this month. Under the strict supervision of the county government, it has been able to end on schedule. County Magistrate Hou Houzong was eager to report, so he notified each district to report in the fastest way. The total number of registered citizens in the county is about 600,000. The county government immediately printed and distributed the citizen certificates according to the number of oath forms reported. However, the procedures such as filling in and stamping are time-consuming. Additional personnel were specially allocated to work overtime to rush the work, and it is expected to be completed within two weeks.</p>
<p>Director Shen Inspects the Sluice</p>
<p>Shen Baixian, Director of the Jiangsu Construction Department, believed that the Menghe Sluice project in Wujin was of great importance. He took a private car on the morning of the 16th and set off from Zhenjiang, arriving directly at Menghe Town. Accompanied by Zhu Tianying, the district chief of the district, he went to the sluice on the ground to check. He also thanked Ma Shushen, a world-renowned doctor in the town, and his nephew Xin'an for curing his brother Huixian's stomach disease, and presented them with silver shields, clothing materials, etc., to commemorate them. He then returned to Zhenjiang by the original car in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Cart Drivers and Dung Carriers on a Major Strike</p>
<p>The Zhenjiang County Government and the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau previously believed that most of the rickshaw drivers in the provincial capital were from other provinces, and there were people from all over the world, and there was no statistics. In order to facilitate investigation and maintain road administration, after formulating the ban rules, they presented them to the Construction Department for review and approval. The Provincial Government Committee approved them on January 31 of this year and allowed them to be implemented. After receiving the order, the county government decided to handle the registration of rickshaws in the provincial capital starting from April 30. However, very few people registered in accordance with the regulations by the deadline. The authorities believed that the matter was a pioneering undertaking, so they announced an extension of 20 days. However, it was still ineffective by the deadline. After extending the deadline to August 10, those who drove without a license would be punished in accordance with the regulations. However, most of the cart drivers still delayed registration. The county government detained a small number of cart drivers who had registered but not paid the license fee. The general cart drivers did not know the truth and disturbed each other. On the previous (14th) day, they gathered at the Chamber of Commerce to petition, but the result was not resolved. The authorities insisted on registering the cart affairs to collect manure, causing the problem of where to dump the chamber pots of each family. The streets and lanes were filled with manure and water, and the stench was overflowing. Pedestrians could not help but frown and cover their noses. By the morning of the 16th, the strike of rickshaw drivers and manure carriers was expanding. Although various institutions and organizations ran around to persuade them, it was still ineffective. On this day, Min Chunhua, the director of the General Labor Union, invited the cart driver masses to talk and promised to completely relieve the suffering of the workers and eliminate disputes. He immediately telephoned the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau to report the course of the conversation and asked the bureau to bail out the two cart drivers in custody. Director Chuan did not want the strike to expand, so he released them at any time. On the one hand, the General Labor Union held a meeting to discuss relevant measures, based on the principle of maintaining the government's prestige and relieving the suffering of the cart drivers. The cart drivers also claimed that they were good, but within an hour, more than 2,000 people suddenly carried their wives and children and paraded in formation, each holding red and green paper flags with petitions, and marched east from Yinshan Dou Street. At the same time, at each street and lane entrance, they would prevent those who carried manure from working. The stores announced their closure upon hearing the news. If there were those who did not agree, the cart driver's family would beg for food from them. The city appearance was chaotic for a while. In order to maintain order, the authorities dispatched a large number of unarmed soldiers and police to suppress the situation along the way. Fortunately, no accidents occurred. On the one hand, they advised the stores to operate as usual, and stopped the cart drivers from moving forward in a peaceful way. However, due to the large number of people, it was impossible to disperse them. The cart drivers arrived at the Provincial Government at about 10 o'clock and gathered in front of the hall without leaving. Director Chuan of the Public Security Bureau persuaded them in a tactful way and promised that the cart drivers would be allowed to operate as usual before the registration matter was resolved. The cart drivers were satisfied and dispersed, and the strike of cart drivers and manure carriers came to an end.</p>

<p>Jiangbei Commercial Daily Suspended</p>
<p>Chen Xiaoru, a Taixing native, published the Jiangbei Commercial Daily in Tongzhou. Because he recorded the dismissal of teachers and staff and the punishment of students in Nantong Middle School, the Special Commissioner's Office found that it was inconsistent with the facts and considered it to be confusing and disturbing. It ordered the county government to stop publishing immediately. The newspaper was suspended on the 16th, and the local court also summoned Chen Xiaoru for questioning.</p>

<p>Actively Reorganizing Anfeng Pond</p>
<p>Anfeng Pond in Shouxian County, Anhui Province, was opened by Sun Shu'ao in the Han Dynasty, also known as Qisi Pond. The function of the pond is to divert water to irrigate the fields in Huainan. Historically, it was as important as the Jingqu in Shaanxi as an important irrigation project in our country. It has been dredged and treated in all dynasties until the end of the Qing Dynasty, so the water conservancy is still thin. Since the Republic of China, it has been out of repair for a long time, resulting in the siltation of the Piyuan and the interruption of the water source. When the water is small, it can only irrigate 12 miles outside the pond. When the water is large, it can only irrigate 18 miles. In dry years, the pond trough is silted up, and the fields are barren, resulting in a large reduction in the harvest. Since the National Economic Commission dredged the Jinghui and other canals, local people in Shouyi have repeatedly requested the association to restore Anfeng Pond to benefit the people's livelihood. Subsequently, the Huai River Guidance Committee sent technical personnel to conduct on-site surveys and establish an Anfeng Pond Reorganization Engineering Office to design the reorganization. The reorganization funds require 130,000 yuan. It is estimated that after the dredging project is completed, it can irrigate 200,000 mu of farmland. It is now heard that the National Economic Commission has allocated funds for handling, and the Huai River Guidance Committee is now actively engaged in dredging to promote reorganization.</p>

Should I violate this oath, I am willing to accept the most severe punishment. Sworn, Wu Tiecheng, National Assembly Representative Election Supervisor for Shanghai City."</p>
<p>Overseer's Speech</p>
<p>The overseer delivered a speech, stating briefly that this National Assembly is an important turning point for our country to enter constitutional government in accordance with the Premier's teachings.

<p>Citywide Citizen Registration Today</p>
<p>The citywide citizen oath-taking and registration are being actively promoted by the National Election Office and are progressing smoothly. The registration of citizens in all districts of the city will be carried out today and tomorrow. The methods have already been announced in the newspapers. In addition, the oath-taking of universities, independent colleges, and people from the four northeastern provinces is also scheduled to be held separately today. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Oath-Taking Groups Yesterday</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM yesterday morning, the staff and members of the groups who took the oath and registered as citizens were the Accountants Association, the Physicians and Pharmacists Association, the National Physicians Association, and the Journalists Association. The Journalists Association held their oath taking at 4:00 PM in the afternoon at the association's headquarters. Overseers He Yuanming, Mao Yun, Yu Zhongbiao, and Huang Xianggu arrived on time to oversee the oath taking. It is estimated that a total of 3,000 people who should be registered as citizens took the oath.</p>
<p>Citizen Registration in Each District</p>
<p>The procedures for citizen registration and oath-taking in each district are divided into two steps. Today and tomorrow (i.e., the 18th and 19th), staff will first be sent to distribute citizen registration forms door-to-door and collect them. All those aged 20 or above and without any of the circumstances listed in Article 3 of the registration rules (such as betraying the National Government, corruption while serving as an official, deprivation of civil rights, being declared legally incompetent, having a mental illness, or using opium) must immediately fill out the form and have the original person bring it back. We will then wait until the next day to send someone to collect them. The second step is to schedule a meeting for the oath-taking and then issue citizen certificates. In addition, the Election Office announced that in the "What professional group member" section of the registration form, if the person has not joined any agricultural, industrial, or independent professional group, they should simply write "None." Otherwise, they should accurately write the name of a certain association or trade association so that it can be determined which election they can participate in when voting in the future, so as not to lose rights on both sides. Furthermore, this time, the distribution of registration forms will cover all the streets and alleys of the city. Fearing that unscrupulous people will take the opportunity to extort money, the office has also notified citizens to pay attention to this point. If any of the above situations are encountered, they are allowed to hand them over to the local police for investigation in the vicinity to facilitate the process.</p>
<p>Oath-Taking by University Faculty</p>
<p>The oath-taking of faculty and staff of universities and independent colleges is also scheduled to be held at 9:00 AM today. The locations have been properly arranged according to geographical proximity, totaling eleven places: (1) Jiaotong (Communications), (2) Guanghua, (3) Jinan, (4) Zhengfeng, (5) Fudan, (6) Business College, (7) Shanghai University (8) Tongji, (9) Sino-French Institute of Technology, (10) Datong, (11) Soochow. All nearby universities and colleges have been notified to participate nearby. All faculty, staff, and workers of each school must attend.</p>
<p>Oath-Taking by People from Four Provinces</p>
<p>People from the four northeastern provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe residing in Shanghai will have a citizen oath-taking and registration site set up at the Xiaoximen Youth Propaganda Group all day today. Compatriots from the four provinces are urged to actively participate and not miss the opportunity.</p>
<p>Explanation of Chamber of Commerce Elections - Explanation of Doubts</p>
<p>The National Election General Affairs Office yesterday telegraphed the Shanghai Election Office, saying: (1) Shanghai Supervisor, Inquiries have been flooding in recently regarding doubts about Chamber of Commerce elections. To put it simply, there are four points: (1) How should store members of various trade associations be recorded in the group roster? (2) Who exercises the voting rights of the aforementioned members? (3) Does each store have one vote, or does each representative have one vote? (4) Do store members of the Chamber of Commerce have the right to nominate and elect? The explanations are as follows: (1) The store's brand name, the representative's name, age, place of origin, and the length of time they have been engaged in their occupation should be recorded. (2) In accordance with the Election Law and Article 24, Paragraph 2, the store is regarded as a trade association group member, and its representative is regarded as a member of that group. (3) Each representative only has one vote. (4) Store members of the Chamber of Commerce are permitted to have their member representatives have the right to vote, but not the right to nominate. This is hereby telegraphed to be followed and ordered to be obeyed by subordinates. National Election Office, Xian Yin. (2) Shanghai Representative Election Supervisor, It is reported that Wu Guozhen, the Mayor of Hankou, telegraphed to inquire about Article 18 of the Occupational Election section of Chapter 3 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Election Law. The organs of the lowest-level group in a professional group are as follows: The Chamber of Commerce is the various trade associations to which it belongs. There is no provision for "store members." Can the aforementioned "store members" participate in the election and the nomination of candidates? If they can participate, in what way should they nominate candidates? Please provide separate instructions. It is found that Article 9 of the Chamber of Commerce Law stipulates: "Chamber of Commerce members can be divided into two types: 1. Association members, 2. Store members. The aforementioned members shall send representatives to attend the Chamber of Commerce, called member representatives." Article 14 of the same law stipulates, "Member representatives shall have the right to vote, the right to elect, and the right to be elected." That is, regardless of whether they are association representatives or store representatives, their rights and obligations are completely equal. Now Article 24 of the Election Law stipulates, "The election of National Assembly representatives shall be conducted by the members of the lowest-level group of each professional group." The regulations for the implementation stipulate, "The lower-level groups of the Chamber of Commerce are the various trade associations to which it belongs." As for store representatives whose businesses have fewer than seven members of the same trade and are unable to organize a trade association, and instead directly join the Chamber of Commerce, there is no clear provision on whether they have the right to participate in the Chamber of Commerce group election. It has now been decided by this office that they should be allowed to participate in the election in accordance with the National Assembly precedents. Since this matter concerns the interpretation of laws and regulations, in addition to replying by telegraph and issuing separate orders, Supervisor should be informed. National Assembly Representative Election Headquarters, Yan Yin.</p>
<p>Situation of Independent Professional Groups - Journalists Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Journalists Association held a citizen oath-taking ceremony at its headquarters at 630 Continental Emporium yesterday afternoon, with more than 170 executive committee members, supervisors, staff, and members attending. Huang Xianggu and Zhu Qifa were sent by the Shanghai National Election Office to be overseers. The association nominated committee members Guan Jiu'an and Huang Tianpeng to serve as chairmen. The ceremony was conducted in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the National Election Office, and the oath-taking was completed at 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Lawyers' Oath-Taking</p>
<p>It is reported that the Shanghai Lawyers Association, upon notification from the Shanghai Representative Election Office of the National Assembly, hereby informs all its members that a citizen oath-taking ceremony will be held all day on the 22nd of this month. The notice states: "It is hereby scheduled to hold a citizen oath-taking ceremony at the association's headquarters at 572 Beile Road from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM on August 22 (Saturday). All members are urged to attend the meeting on time to take the oath. This is a special notice."</p>
<p>Medical Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Medical Association is scheduled to convene a meeting of standing committee members of medical associations from various regions on August 23 to discuss the methods of advancing or retreating with respect to the National Assembly elections. The association's notice to medical associations in various regions states: "We are writing to inform you that regarding the item on physicians and pharmacists in the National Assembly representative elections, according to the notice, it includes traditional Chinese medicine practitioners. Moreover, the General Election Office has now decided to hold a mixed election and cannot change it. The key to success or failure in this matter is of great importance. We plan to jointly discuss the methods of advancing or retreating with medical associations from various regions. This matter is urgent. We urge the standing committee members of your association to come to our association at 33 Chihong Road, Shanghai, at 2:00 PM on August 23 to jointly determine the direction. If the standing committee members cannot come together, please designate one person or send a responsible representative to attend the meeting. This is what we hope for. This is addressed to the medical associations in various regions, from the Shanghai Medical Association."</p>
<p>The National Federation of Physicians has recently received letters and telegrams from medical associations in various regions claiming that there are doubts about the General Election Office's notice regarding the mixed election of Chinese and Western medicine practitioners. Yesterday, the Federation submitted a request to the General Election Office to clarify the nature of the Physicians Association and the National Physicians Association. The original text is excerpted below: "Regarding the request to immediately designate a legal group to comply with laws and regulations and benefit the electoral administration, the association previously stated that if the physicians in the category of physicians and pharmacists listed in Table 4 of this National Assembly Representative Election Law include both Chinese and Western medicine, difficulties will inevitably arise in the election. We have asked your office to explain or clearly delineate the quotas to provide relief and facilitate the process. However, according to reports, there is still a resolution to hold a mixed election. This association has repeatedly received letters from the majority of physicians associations in Shanghai, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Hangxian, Wuxian, Minhou, Hankou, and other regions stating that the physicians associations in each region have applied for registration in accordance with the Public Associations Organization Law and have been established for many years. Subsequently, so-called National Physicians Associations have appeared in the same region. If these organizations are considered to be trade associations of the same nature as physicians associations, it would conflict with the purpose of the Public Associations Organization Law, which stipulates that there cannot be a second trade association of the same nature in the same region. The relevant authorities 'actually allow the existence of such organizations, which clearly demonstrates that they are not trade associations of the same nature.' If this election recognizes these National Physicians Associations as physician groups and gives them the same electoral qualifications, there will inevitably be two trade associations of the same nature competing in the same region. Considering the laws and regulations, there is a conflict. According to the facts, it is difficult to implement, etc.' After repeated consideration, this association is unable to resolve the issue. The only option is to submit a request to your office to clarify the nature of the Physicians Association and the National Physicians Association, and to immediately issue a clear order designating one as a legal group to comply with laws and regulations and benefit the electoral administration. This would be for the public good. Respectfully submitted to Jiang, Director of the National Assembly Representative Election Headquarters, and Chu, Deputy Director, by Xu Naili, Chairman of the National Federation of Physicians."</p>
<p>National Physicians Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Physicians Association, in compliance with the order, held a citizen oath-taking ceremony for all executive committee members, supervisors, and members yesterday. Starting at 9:00 AM, the ceremony was held in the auditorium of the association's headquarters on Bazilu Road. Executive committee members, supervisors, and members present included Ding Cuiying, Guo Boliang, Xie Liheng, Gu Weichuan, Lu Shi'e, Ding Jiwan, Shen Zhuoru, Cai Xiangsun, Fang Gongpu, Chuan Yongyan, Zhang Zanchen, and more than 1,600 members. Chairman Ding Zhongying led the ceremony, and overseer Yu Zhongbiao delivered a speech. Wang Guoping gave instructions on registration matters, and the ceremony was completed at 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Postal Workers Union</p>
<p>Regarding the participation of the Postal Workers Union in the National Assembly elections, after the National Postal Workers General Union and local postal workers unions submitted requests, the National Assembly Representative Election Office and the Central People's Training Department consulted and reached a concrete solution. The Shanghai Election Supervisor yesterday received an instruction from the General Office, Min Zong Zi No. 33, which reads: "It is found that the National Postal Workers General Union, the National Postal Workers General Association, and local postal workers unions have jointly submitted requests to re-verify the quota of special representatives of the Workers Union. In addition, the Nanjing Postal Workers Union, the Hankou Postal Workers Union, the Shanghai Postal Workers Union, the Jiujiang Postal Workers Union, the Xiamen Postal Workers Union, and five other locations have successively submitted requests for approval to participate in the general industrial sector elections. Based on this, whether the National Postal Workers General Union, etc., are legally organized and established is not on file with this office. After writing to the Central People's Training Department to verify and respond, a re-examination will be conducted. We have now received a reply stating that the following four points have been decided regarding the issue of the Postal Workers Union's participation in the National Assembly representative elections: (1) All local postal workers unions that have been registered with the local senior party department and whose organization and organizational members are temporarily complying with the provisions of the Trade Union Law and its implementation regulations may participate in the representative elections in the local industrial sector. (2) All local postal workers unions that have previously been registered with the local senior party department but whose organization is not yet sound may temporarily comply with the Trade Union Law and its implementation regulations and immediately reorganize and rectify. Those who can complete the reorganization before the National Assembly elections may participate in the representative elections in the local industrial sector. (3) Local postal workers unions that have not previously been registered with the local senior party department, or have been registered with the local senior party department but whose organization is illegal and cannot be handled in accordance with item 2, are not allowed to participate in the election. (4) The organization of the National Postal Workers General Union, the National Postal Workers General Association, and the provincial and municipal postal workers associations has no legal basis and is not allowed to participate in the election. These replies have been reviewed and approved. In addition to notifying the election supervisors of all provinces and cities to comply, the National Postal Workers General Union and the National Postal Workers General Association will be notified, and replies will be sent and orders issued. The supervisor is hereby ordered to comply, investigate whether the local postal workers union is a legally organized and directly provide instructions, and report the handling situation for future reference. This is of utmost importance. This order, etc." It is also heard that the Shanghai Election Supervisor, after receiving the order, has presented a report to the General Office to comply, etc.</p>

<p>The industrial and commercial sectors of this city, in view of the economic downturn and sluggish business, have requested the Ministry of Finance to order various banks and money shops to reduce loan interest rates in order to reduce costs and promote development. After receiving the request, the Ministry of Finance, in order to safeguard industry and commerce, specifically instructed the Shanghai Banking and Money Industry Associations to study and present methods for reducing loan interest rates for review and approval in order to provide relief. After receiving the order, the Banking and Money Industry Associations organized a group meeting. After several discussions, they gathered various opinions and submitted them to the Ministry for review and approval. A New News Agency reporter learned from the financial sector that reducing loan interest rates is, in fact, fraught with difficulties and may not be implemented. It is said that our country is an agricultural nation, with farmers accounting for more than 80% of the population. Therefore, most of the various goods produced by factories rely on farmers for purchase. The industrial and commercial sectors only act as intermediaries, taking a small profit. In recent years, due to the global economic recession, coupled with repeated disasters, the rural economy of our country is on the verge of bankruptcy. The purchasing power of farmers has decreased, and industry and commerce have also declined as a result. Therefore, the prosperity or decline of the rural economy is closely related to the prosperity or decline of industry and commerce. After research by experts, it is generally believed that developing industry and commerce should first focus on cultivating the countryside. As for reducing loan interest rates to rescue industry and commerce, it is not a fundamental solution. Reducing loan interest rates must first reduce deposit interest rates. Otherwise, the financial sector will inevitably have no business to operate. If deposit interest rates are reduced, the result may be that people's cash will be absorbed by foreign banks, and there is a risk that domestic funds will flee. Therefore, in order to avoid the occurrence of this situation, various banks and money shops are now actively engaged in rural loans. The results achieved can directly gradually restore the rural economy and indirectly safeguard the development of industry and commerce.</p>

<p>Translated by the Foreign News Agency from the China Press: Although a large amount of rice has been transported to Shanghai, there is still no sign of surplus in this port. It is rumored that this is due to large-scale purchases, and the buyers are major Japanese companies. The situation of these companies purchasing rice is extremely busy. Whenever rice shipments arrive, they are immediately purchased. According to general estimates, Shanghai currently has an estimated 200,000 bags of rice stockpiled, and more shipments are expected to arrive continuously.</p>

<p>Party and National Leaders Jointly Initiate - Gliding Association to be Established Soon</p>
<p>Li Jingcong, General Manager of the Eurasia Aviation Corporation, while dedicating himself to developing the aviation industry, recognized that the gliding sport, which is popular in Europe and the United States, can temper physical and mental strength and is quite necessary for the physical education of our people. He especially used his own business power to promote the gliding sport. After Li widely solicited party and national leaders and people from all walks of life to jointly initiate the sport, he has now obtained the support of people from all walks of life at home and abroad, and is engaged in organizing a Gliding Research Association in Shanghai to actively train gliding skills. The organization will soon be realized. On the one hand, the company has also invested in manufacturing gliders itself for trial use.

<h3 id="e88">US Increases Tax on Chinese Wine - Chinese Wine to Disappear - Chinese Merchants Suffer Annual Loss of US$500,000 to $600,000 - Additional Taxes Added Besides Consolidated Tax and Stamp Duty <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>After the United States lifted the alcohol ban in 1934, Congress promulgated the Liquor Tax Law, which requires all types of alcohol to pay a consolidated tax and stamp duty. Alcohol dealers must pay a license tax. Chinese medicinal wines were widely sold in the United States during the alcohol ban period. Recently, the United States mainland recognized that Chinese medicinal wines with an alcohol content of 24% or more will be treated as strong alcohol from June 1 this year. In addition to paying a consolidated tax, stamp duty, and license tax, various surcharges must also be paid (resulting in a sharp increase in the burden, making it impossible to compete with other wines and leading to their disappearance from the US market. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Types of Wine Sold to the US</p>
<p>The types of Chinese wine sold in the US market include Wujiapi wine, Bai Nuo wine, black Da wine, Laiyang wine, Winter Melon wine, Papaya wine, Kumquat wine, Shi Guogong Sanzheng wine, Rose wine, Baili wine, Sanbian wine, Ginseng and Velvet Antler wine, Gecko wine, Dragon and Tiger wine, Baisui wine, Chicken Claw wine, Tiger Bone Country wine, Wei wine, Yinchen wine, Orange Blossom wine, etc. For example, Wujiapi wine sells for only 50 cents per bottle in Shanghai, while it currently sells for US$2.80 in the US. During the prohibition period, strong and weak wines were both banned. However, medicinal wines only needed to obtain an import license to be imported in a steady stream without restrictions. Therefore, in the past, except for strong and weak wines, imports were relatively reduced, and medicinal wines had a very wide market. Since the lifting of the ban in 1934, the number of Chinese wine exports has been even greater.</p>
<p>Taxation</p>
<p>The types of taxes paid by Chinese wine exported to the US are: (1) The consolidated tax is paid by the manufacturer or importer. For strong alcohol, it is US$2 per standard gallon. For weak wine, it is US$0.10 per gallon for alcohol content below 14%, US$0.20 per gallon for alcohol content above 14%, and US$0.40 per gallon for alcohol content above 20%. For alcohol content above 24%, it is taxed as strong alcohol. (2) Stamp duty: when retailing, strong alcohol requires a stamp of US$0.01 on the bottle. (3) License tax: (A) Wholesalers pay an annual business tax of US$100. (B) Retailers pay an annual business tax of US$25. (C) Manufacturers pay an annual business tax of US$200. For annual production below 500 barrels, it is US$100.</p>
<p>Imposition of Miscellaneous Taxes</p>
<p>Since the lifting of the alcohol ban, all Chinese wines, whether strong or weak, have been taxed according to regulations and have been imported in a steady stream. However, medicinal wines were considered to be medicinal materials rather than beverages according to the US Customs interpretation and were exempt from all consolidated taxes, stamp duties, and license taxes in addition to the import tax, which greatly benefited overseas Chinese merchants. From June 1 this year, the United States mainland considers Chinese medicinal wines to be beverages in fact, even though they are medicinal wines according to the customs regulations. In addition to paying consolidated taxes, stamp duties, and license taxes, surcharges must also be paid in the same way as strong and weak alcohol. The amount is very large, making it impossible for Chinese wines to compete with other wines in the future, leading to their disappearance. The future is extremely pessimistic. Chinese merchants will suffer an annual loss of US$500,000 to US$600,000.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Yangtze River Water-Land Passenger Joint Transport - Tripartite Agreement Already Signed - Implemented on the 21st of This Month <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, together with the Shanghai-Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway and the Jiangnan Railway, will operate joint water-land passenger transport on the Yangtze River. After a long period of discussion, the three parties agreed on joint ticket methods and submitted them to the Ministry of Transportation for approval. A contract was signed by the three parties and will be implemented from the 21st of this month. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Process of Agreement</p>
<p>Regarding the joint passenger transport between the Yangtze River and Shanghai, and the detailed rules for joint tickets, Mr. Hu Quansheng, the head of the passenger transport division of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, has been in contact with the railway bureau and has submitted a request to the Ministry of Transportation for verification. As the various parties involved in the railway have reviewed the established methods and found them appropriate, Mr. Xiao Weiguo from the two railway bureaus and Mr. Zhou Xiansong from the Jiangnan Railway were dispatched yesterday to sign a trial contract together with Mr. Zeng Guangqing, the business director of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company.</p>
<p>Date of Implementation</p>
<p>The tripartite contract stipulates that it will be implemented starting from August 21st. A trial run will be conducted for half a year, expiring on February 21st of next year. If the results are deemed excellent during the trial period, all parties willing to continue may do so. As the implementation date is approaching, all water-land joint tickets have been printed and are sold by the ticket sales division of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The price of the joint tickets is a quarter cheaper than the usual segmented transfers. The Jiangnan Railway has also dispatched a special train that can go directly from Wuhu to Zhenjiang, and the tracks have been connected.</p>
<p>Locations of Joint Transport</p>
<p>The locations for the Yangtze River water-land joint transport have been agreed upon. For the land route, the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway runs from Shanghai North Station, through Suzhou, Wuxi, Wujin, and Zhenjiang West Station, to Yaohuamen. For the Jiangnan Railway, it is from Yaohuamen, Zhonghua Gate, Dangtu, Xuancheng East Station, to Wuhu. For the water route, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's ships will take passengers from Wuhu, through Datong, Anqing, Jiujiang, Wuxue, to Hankou. Passengers traveling from Shanghai to Wuhu can take the train at North Station at 7:00 AM and arrive at around 5:00 PM that afternoon, which is 29 hours shorter than taking a Yangtze River boat.</p>
<p>Fixed Ticket Prices</p>
<p>The water-land train and boat joint tickets from Shanghai by train, transferring to the Jiangnan Railway, and then by China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's ships via the Wuhu waterway, have been priced segment by segment. However, to provide preferential treatment to passengers, there is a 25% discount for first and second class and an 11% discount for third and fourth class. The ticket prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai-Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Ticket Price List</p>
<p>Jiangnan Railway Ticket Price List</p>
<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Ship Ticket Price List</p>
<p>Note: The ticket prices listed in the above four tables are all calculated based on the specified discounts, and are for estimating the price of joint tickets only.</p>

<p>Wang Junsheng Speaks of Continued Burial After Autumn Cools, Requiring Considerable Expenses, Hoping for Assistance from Benevolent People - In four locations including Wujiang and Jiaxing, coffins are scattered across the fields. Those without descendants have been exposed for more than a year, and their bones are exposed with no one to manage them. According to investigations, there are as many as tens of thousands of such exposed bones. Over the years, Mr. Wang Yiting of Shanghai has commissioned Mr. Wang Junsheng of the Pushan Villa to raise large sums of money to bury ownerless exposed bones in areas such as Wujiang, Zhenze, Pingwang, Bei*, Jiaxing, Puyuan, Nanxun, Wangjiangjing, and Wangdian. Over the years, more than 80,000 bones have been buried, bringing peace to the deceased and greatly benefiting charity and hygiene. People have praised this endlessly. According to Mr. Wang, there are still 60,000 to 70,000 exposed bones in Wujiang, Jiaxing, and other places that have not been fully buried, which makes him uneasy. However, to bury them one by one would require considerable expense. He is currently discussing the funding with various benevolent people, hoping to continue the work after the autumn cools and begin working, hoping for generous help to accomplish this task, so that the exposed bones can be put to rest in peace, a great merit.</p>

<p>To the Health Department of the Municipal Council - Requesting the Prohibition of the Use of Traditional Chinese Scales</p>
<p>The fresh meat industry in the Public Concession of this city, because the restaurant industry and citizens do not comply with the new system of weights and measures stipulated by the government and continue to use traditional Chinese scales, the industry is suffering significant losses invisibly. Therefore, representatives such as Sun Hongyang have been sent to the Municipal Council this morning with a letter to petition for a ban. The original letter is recorded as follows: "Respectfully, according to various colleagues who have come to the association to claim that, regarding the weights and measures stipulated by the Chinese government, it has been almost a year, and the colleagues have long complied with the case, but other colleagues, such as noodle restaurants, restaurants, kitchens, and citizens, still use the traditional Chinese scales, regarding government orders and other documents as mere formalities, making it difficult for colleagues to operate. We request that your association send staff to the Health Department of the Municipal Council to strictly prohibit them, and send police to various vegetable markets to prohibit carrying traditional Chinese scales, in order to facilitate operations and comply with the law." Based on this, we are sending Sun Hongyang, Yang Pingheng, Fan Deyu, Huang Qixun, and Wang Liangbao, five people, to request that your bureau, considering the suffering of colleagues, grant an audience, and request that you send staff to various vegetable markets to strictly prohibit colleagues and citizens from carrying traditional Chinese scales, to alleviate the difficulties of merchants and comply with the law. Respectfully, to the Health Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council.</p>

<p>Cocoon Merchants Can Directly Borrow - Procedures Are the Same as During the Spring Period</p>
<p>The Jiangzhe autumn silkworm industry is starting to incubate after the county governments distributed silkworm eggs to farmers. The Zhejiang Provincial Cocoon Industry Association has scheduled a meeting in Hangzhou on the 23rd of this month to discuss methods for purchasing autumn cocoons. Various silk factories in this city have also begun preparing to organize agencies to purchase autumn cocoons and handle matters related to cocoon purchases. The Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Shanghai Bank, and other banks have decided that they will no longer organize a syndicate to undertake cocoon purchase loans, as the production of autumn cocoons has always been less than that of spring cocoons. They will continue to follow the usual practice and handle it themselves. Therefore, silk factories and residual cocoon merchants in Jiangsu and Zhejiang who wish to purchase autumn cocoons can directly contact various banks and money houses to negotiate loans. The loan methods are all the same as those of the Jiangzhe Cocoon Purchase Loan Syndicate during the spring period, it is said.</p>

<p>Scheduled to be Established on September 1st, Methods for Recalling Silver Coins Already Determined - After Song Ziliang, the Special Commissioner of Finance of Guangdong Province and Director of the Department of Finance, arrived in Guangzhou, in order to thoroughly abolish exorbitant taxes and reorganize finance, he specially borrowed 6 million yuan from the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, using unified taxes as collateral. A contract has been signed, and the Guangzhou branches of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications will allocate the funds nearby. The Central Bank has also entrusted the Bank of China to transfer the funds. The Guangdong Department of Finance intends to borrow an additional 4 million yuan from the three banks, bringing the total amount to 10 million yuan, it is said. The Central Bank and the Bank of China have both denied this. As for the establishment of a Guangzhou branch by the Central Bank, after the bank dispatched Li Tisheng, Deputy Director of the Treasury Bureau, and Zhou Shouliang, Deputy Director of the Business Bureau, to Guangzhou to actively prepare, it is said that a location for the bank has been found in Guangzhou and preparations are underway. If time permits, it is scheduled to be established on September 1st. Regarding the issue of converting to the silver dollar system in Guangdong Province, according to the reporter's investigation, Zou Lin, Vice Minister of Finance, Song Ziliang, Director of the Guangdong Department of Finance, and others have formulated methods for reorganizing silver coins in Guangdong Province, suggesting that 1.13 silver coins be equivalent to one silver dollar, or that a 30% discount be applied to the silver dollar to show consideration for the people of Guangdong holding silver coins. The methods have been submitted to Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi for review, and it is expected that they will be implemented soon, gradually recalling all silver coins in order to achieve the goal of currency unification, it is said.</p>

<p>Financial Circles Express Opinions - No Confidence in Preparation</p>
<p>Ta Kung Pao reports that, in view of the decline of the real estate industry, the Ministry of Finance specially ordered Song Ziliang of the China Construction Bank to be responsible for preparing for the establishment of a real estate mortgage bank in order to facilitate the flow of funds and adjust finance. The work has been temporarily suspended because the Real Estate Compulsory Execution Law has not yet been formally promulgated. The reporter specially asked the financial circles yesterday about the establishment of a real estate mortgage bank and the future environment. According to the opinions expressed, they are quite important. The following is a record of the conversation. In recent years, due to the extreme exhaustion of the social economy, no one in this city has inquired about real estate. For example, many urban houses or residences are empty. All real estate merchants have suffered heavy losses and are eager to seek a way out. The establishment of a real estate mortgage bank cannot be flexibly rotated with only several million in capital. Once real estate merchants mortgage a large number of properties to the bank at the same time, the bank will be unable to cope, and business will be extremely dangerous. The Ministry of Finance plans to allocate half of the bank's 5 million capital and raise the other half from various banks. Currently, the various banks are wary of joining the capital due to the above-mentioned difficulties. Therefore, although the preparatory office of the real estate bank has been established, there is still no confidence in the actual preparation, it is said.</p>

<p>Drawing Lots for Booth Locations on the 25th - Opening Determined for the 1st of Next Month</p>
<p>The Shanghai Autumn National Products Exhibition, organized by the Shanghai Chinese National Products Manufacturers Association, has been in preparation for ten days and has been very busy soliciting manufacturers and arranging booth locations. Manufacturers in this city, in view of the fact that the autumn season has arrived and seasonal goods are bound to sell well, have been very enthusiastic in registering. In order to allow national product factories to participate as much as possible, the Association has issued a notice urging registration. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Notice to All Factories</p>
<p>The Association recently issued a notice stating, "For the purpose of notifying, this Association has specifically surveyed the vacant land at the west end of the Penglai Road Penglai Market in the prosperous area of Southern Shanghai to hold the Autumn National Products Exhibition and set up a temporary National Products Bazaar. It has been investigated that previous exhibitions in this location have achieved great success, so one hundred and fifty temporary sheds have been built to provide manufacturers with exhibition and publicity opportunities. The publicity efforts will be as grand as possible. Registration has already begun, requesting manufacturers to participate. When summer ends and autumn arrives, seasonal goods will definitely sell well. Therefore, we have enclosed the participation guidelines. We urge all national product factories to participate enthusiastically. The opening is scheduled for the 1st of September, and booth locations will be drawn on the 25th of August. The registration office is located in Penglai Garden. Those who wish to participate can go directly to that office to negotiate. The opening date is approaching, and we fear that you may miss the opportunity if you are late. This is a special notice."</p>
<p>Actively Preparing</p>
<p>Since the Autumn National Products Exhibition announced its opening on September 1st, the Association has been actively carrying out construction of booth locations, in view of the fact that the number of registered factories has been very enthusiastic. The blueprints have already been sent to the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works, and construction will begin as soon as they are approved.

<p>Opening Collection as Scheduled on the 1st of Next Month - Training Staff Currently</p>
<p>In order to handle direct tax revenue, the detailed rules for the collection of income tax prepared by the Ministry of Finance have been drafted by Liang Jing, who is in charge of preparation, and taken to Kuling for review by Minister of Finance Kong. The collection can be opened as scheduled on the 1st of next month. The Ministry of Finance is currently preparing for the opening of the collection work very actively. All staff have been recruited and are undergoing training in advance so that they can be assigned to various places to serve after the collection is opened. Recently, the Shanghai business community telegraphed the Ministry of Finance requesting that the threshold for salary income be changed to 50 yuan. The financial authorities believe that since the Income Tax Law has already been passed by the Legislative Yuan, whether it needs to be amended still needs to go through the legislative process before a decision can be made. When the collection is opened in the future, the Ministry plans to send experts to form a committee with local authorities and impartial gentry to handle the matter fairly, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Detailed Account of Xue Jiasheng's Escape from Danger: Bandits Planned for Ten Months Before Taking Action; Backstage Boss Provided Advance of Over Two Thousand Three Hundred Gold Coins <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Xue Jiasheng, the third son of the deceased wealthy Jiangyin paint merchant Xue Baorun, was kidnapped from his residence on the afternoon of the first of this month. The kidnappers demanded a huge ransom for his release. The family received several letters from the bandits, but negotiations failed. On the afternoon of the fourteenth of this month, at around six o'clock, the Chinese and foreign detectives of the French police successfully located the bandit's hideout, arrested the kidnappers, and rescued the hostage safely. This has already been reported in this newspaper. Now, a supplementary account of the case-solving process is provided: After Xue Jiasheng was kidnapped, the French police received a report from Xue's family and immediately dispatched detectives to investigate. They also stationed detectives at Xue's residence to</p>
<p>Guard the Telephone</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the fourteenth of this month, at around five o'clock, the Xue residence received a phone call from the kidnappers urging them to pay the ransom. The police inquired with the telephone company, who replied that the call had originated from Xu Chongdao Pharmacy on Avenue Joffre. The police then sent detectives to Xu Chongdao Pharmacy to investigate. They learned that the call had been made by a man in a Western suit who lived nearby at number 72. With this clue, the police, led by Inspectors Jin Jiulin and Qian Chenglong, along with Detectives Zhou Buguang, Zhou Bingcheng, and Detectives Zuo Qihong and Ma Yizhi, and over twenty others,</p>
<p>Fully Armed</p>
<p>Rushed to number 72 Avenue Joffre to search the premises. As they arrived in front of the house, two men walked out. The detectives immediately detained them and questioned them. Their answers were evasive. They then entered the house and conducted a detailed search, arresting five bandits: Chen Jintang, Bu Mingqing, Sun Yanan, Chen Yaozhang, and Zhang Ruifa. One bandit had already escaped to the bandits' hideout at number 222 Rue Paul Henry, to warn the guards. Upon receiving the warning, the hostage guards immediately fled, allowing the hostage to</p>
<p>Escape Leisurely</p>
<p>The case was thus solved. Subsequently, two Mauser pistols, both loaded, and a ledger were found at number 72 Avenue Joffre and taken back to the police station. A team was then sent to inspect the hostage's confinement location. The opium smoking paraphernalia, sweets, and fruits that the bandits had provided for the hostage were all arranged on the bed. Detectives were stationed to guard the location. After photographing fingerprints at the location with electric flash and detailed searching the next day, two more loaded Browning pistols were found under the bedcovers. Furthermore, Chen Dongsheng, the owner of</p>
<p>Youning Automobile Company</p>
<p>Was arrested from the Public Concession and brought back to the police station. Yesterday, all were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Special District, where Judge Wang Gangxu presided over the hearing. Police lawyer Gu Shouxi stated the kidnapping of Xue Jiasheng for ransom and the process of solving the case, adding that the case was complex and requesting a two-week postponement for further investigation before initiating legal proceedings. The court then ordered the defendants to be questioned separately. First, Chen Jintang was questioned. He confessed that four people went to kidnap Xue, including himself, Bu Mingqing (who was already arrested), and the fugitives Su Yacai and Zhang Zhihua. They carried four pistols. They started from in front of</p>
<p>A Car Departed</p>
<p>From in front of the Jiuxing Grand Theater on Avenue Edward VII. Chen did not know where the hostage was hidden after the kidnapping, because Su and Zhang took the hostage away. Later, Zhang Zhihua told Chen that he had called the hostage's family, demanding 100,000 yuan in ransom. Sun Yanan was brought by Yacai to serve as a tea boy. Chen Jintang did not know Pu Yaozhang, Zhang Ruifa, Chen Dongsheng, etc. Su Yacai and Zhang Zhihua were in charge of this matter. Bu Mingqing confessed that the four people who went were himself, Chen Jintang, Su Yacai, and Zhang Zhihua. Each carried a pistol. Zhang opened the door and they went in to kidnap the hostage. They first hid the hostage at number 72 Avenue Joffre. That night, Su and Zhang took the hostage elsewhere. Later, Zhang Zhihua said that they could</p>
<p>Obtain Tens of Thousands of Dollars</p>
<p>In ransom money. Next, Pu Yaozhang, Zhang Ruifa, Sun Yanan, and Chen Dongsheng were questioned. All four denied participating in the kidnapping. Sun confessed to serving as a tea boy at number 72 Avenue Joffre. Chen Dongsheng confessed to running Youning Automobile Company and knowing nothing about the kidnapping. They hired lawyer Ma Leming to defend them in court. After examining the confessions, the court ordered a postponement for further hearing on the morning of the 30th. The defendants were returned to custody. It is also rumored that the bandits began planning this case in November last year and kidnapped Xue on August 1st of this year. The discussion and planning took ten months, and there was also a backstage boss who advanced funds amounting to more than two thousand three hundred gold coins.</p>

<p>Accompanied by Five Male and Female Disciples; Shanghai Buddhist Association Sent Him Off with Due Ceremony</p>
<p>According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, Zhaokong, the Hungarian monk who had tangled with a certain Russian newspaper last year and was not recognized as a strange monk, has left Shanghai for Tianjin. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Failed Sea Voyage: Last year, Zhaokong once planned to rebuild a sailing ship and return to Europe, but the plan failed due to lack of funds for shipbuilding and travel expenses. At the same time, his household in Shanghai was large, including five foreign disciples (three females and two males) named Daoji, Daowei, Daoming, Daole, and Daoqin, respectively. Although they occasionally received assistance from Buddhist organizations, Zhaokong had a strong personality, and the monasteries did not welcome his presence, so he had to rent a separate residence, leading to increasing financial difficulties, not to mention shipbuilding and traveling to Europe.</p>
<p>Leaving Shanghai for Tianjin: Recently, through the local Buddhist community in Shanghai, he was introduced to Buddhist organizations in Tianjin, and several hundred yuan were raised for travel expenses. The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Buddhist Association held a farewell ceremony before his departure. Attendees included Wang Yiting, Qu Wenliu, Huang Hanzhi, and Guan Jiong. It is also understood that after Zhaokong arrives in Tianjin, he will be welcomed by the local Buddhist organizations, as there have been no foreign monks in the northern region who have become Chinese.</p>

She immediately went and was led to room number 18 upstairs. Zhou was already waiting there. The apprentices who led her in exited. Zhou then tried to take off her clothes. She sternly refused. Zhou left in anger and locked the door, confining her in the room until around 9 AM. Zhou returned to the room and demanded a room fee of five jiao. Because Zhou had someone call her over, and it was not her intention to come, she refused to pay. Zhou then claimed that she owed two yuan and five jiao in previous room fees. Since she had never owed any money, she denied it. Zhou then instructed her to take off her two gold earrings and a gold ring to pawn them for cash to pay the debt. A and B, two workers, accompanied her to Hongxing Pawnshop on Hubei Road to pawn them. The police sent Chinese and foreign detectives to the Shangxi Hotel to arrest Zhou Gengsheng, who was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Special District yesterday morning, where Judge Feng Shide presided over the hearing.

The other night, when Wang came, Zhou asked for previous debts, and Wang took her gold rings and pawned them herself. Zhou did not take off her clothes, and did not lock her in the room. Wang Xingbao confessed that she and Zhou had a previous arrangement. He sent someone the other night to call her to play, and after she went, he asked her not to go home, and tried to take off her clothes. After she refused, he locked her in the room. The next morning Zhou came and forcibly seized her gold rings and pawned them to pay the debt, but she had never owed any room fees. Judge Feng verified the confessions and ordered Zhou Gengsheng to pay a five hundred yuan bail and postponed the hearing to next Friday.</p>

The company reported to the Laozha police station, and Chief Detective Pang Ruiqing led a large number of detectives to the scene and arrested Jiang Caijin, Shi Zijing, He Yongkang, Yu Awang, Wang Shuichong, Xu Fusheng, Wang Apin, Wang Yaojin, and other eight people who were disturbing the peace.

Police lawyer Jiang Baolian stated the case, accusing the defendants of violating Article 150 of the criminal code for disturbing the peace. Judge Huang Daxi questioned the defendants and verified the facts, ordering them to be detained pending sentencing on the 21st.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Baby Girl Dies from Accidental Ingestion of Opium Ash; Guo Hongbin Sentenced <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Six Months Imprisonment Suspended for Two Years</p>
<p>Guo Hongbin, a native of Shandong, lives at number 17 Huasheng Lane, Huasheng Road. He is a martial artist in the Shaolin Martial Arts Troupe of the Dajing class at Wing On Company. He has two sons and one baby girl, named Qiaoying, who is only four months old. She recently suffered from diarrhea. On the morning of the 8th of this month, around 5:00 AM, without his wife Gong's consent, Guo secretly fed the girl opium ash. The poison took effect, and she died at 9:00 PM. Gong believed that her husband had intentionally poisoned the girl to death. She was extremely saddened and reported to the Jiaxing Road police station. Detective Ma Anxiang was dispatched to arrest Guo and escort him to the First Special District Court for questioning. The infant's body was examined by the court prosecutor at the forensic laboratory on Feiren Road, and it was determined that the cause of death was poisoning due to illness during life. Yesterday morning, Judge Chui Xiao presided over the continued trial in the Third Criminal Court. Department of Justice lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated that Gong reported to the police station that the girl was sick, her husband was unaware, and she was crying at the time, so he fed her opium ash, causing her death. She changed her testimony in the police station, saying that the girl was sick, and her husband mistakenly gave her opium ash, etc. Gong claimed that her girl was sick, and her husband did not know at first, and that he found out later. When questioned, the defendant's confession was evasive. Judge Zhong sentenced Guo Hongbin to six months imprisonment, suspended for two years, and forbade him from blindly feeding infants toxic substances in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Sealing Door for Rent Arrears, Tenant Resists and Attacks: Bailiff Sun Qingshan's Life in Danger; Defendant Liu Abing Detained Pending Rescheduled Trial <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Liu Abing, an old man residing at number 148, Lane 162, Changping Road, West Shanghai, earns a living as a peddler. He was sued in the First Special Court by his landlord, Mrs. Shen Xu, for several months of rent arrears. A judgment had been made and was due to be executed. Therefore, on Saturday morning of last week, the execution office of the court sent clerk Yang Yumin, bailiff Lv Zhaoxiong, and bailiff Sun Qingshan to execute the sealing of the premises. Unexpectedly, Liu Abing dared to resist, not only throwing lime at bailiff Lv and bailiff Sun's eyes, but also砍傷bailiff Sun's back and legs with a firewood axe, inflicting serious injuries. Liu was immediately arrested and detained in the police station. It is learned that Liu Ke Bing, who was arrested, is 54 years old and a native of Jiangyin. Yesterday morning, he was escorted by the Gordon Road police to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin filed a public prosecution in accordance with Articles 135(1) and 132 of the criminal code for obstructing official duties and Article 271(2) of the same code for attempted murder. He stated the circumstances at the time, saying that bailiff Lv Zhaoxiong's lime injury had healed after being washed with medicine in the hospital and that he was present. However, bailiff number 12 Sun Qingshan suffered severe axe wounds on his back, three and a half inches deep, causing a lot of bleeding. His eyes were inflamed and swollen due to the lime, and his condition was critical, potentially endangering his life. Yesterday, the police took the suspect Liu Abing to the Public Works Bureau Hospital, where Sun identified him as the perpetrator. However, the axe could not be found anywhere, presumably having been discarded on the way by the defendant and picked up by someone else. Because Sun's life is uncertain, the case will be postponed. Bailiff Lv Zhaoxiong stated that he was ordered to go to Lane 162, Changping Road the other morning to seal the households of five tenants who owed rent. Four had already been sealed, and the defendant was the last one. He was already harboring bad intentions, so he prepared lime in a bag. When I ordered him to move, the defendant threw lime at my face. Fortunately, I had on a peaked cap, which prevented serious eye injury. Bailiff Sun Qingshan stepped forward to negotiate, but the defendant threw lime again and took out an axe. I then turned and went outside to call the police, so I did not see him砍傷. Landlord Mrs. Shen Xu and Zhang Huaizi, a driver from the Da Lai Automobile Company, testified to the defendant's attack. The defendant Liu Abing confessed that the bailiff and others came and forced him to move, but there were no seals, no Chinese or foreign police officers, so he was not willing to move. The bailiff slapped him in the face, so he grabbed two handfuls of lime from the ground and threw them. He also threw the firewood knife at the bailiff. Seizing an opportunity, he fled to the police station to report and was arrested. Judge Huang Risheng questioned the defendant about why he reported to the police, and the defendant replied that the bailiff and others came to seal the door privately. The court ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and the case to be rescheduled for hearing on the 26th of this month.</p>

<p>Pregnant Woman Aborts After Taking Medicine</p>
<p>Du Youming, a native of Funing, 31 years old, lives on the east side of Tanzi Bay Temple, where he works as a night soil collector. His wife, Mrs. Yang, 29 years old, is currently six months pregnant. Recently, Mrs. Yang suffered from dysentery, so the other day she accompanied her husband to the clinic of Doctor Gu, a doctor from Jiangbei, nearby. After receiving the prescription, Mrs. Yang took it to the Tianbao Tang Pharmacy on the east side of the temple to have it filled. Unexpectedly, the pharmacy incorrectly dispensed three of the herbs listed on the prescription – *Plantago asiatica*, agarwood, and borneol. After taking the medicine, Mrs. Yang suffered abdominal pain like a knife. Her illness did not subside, and instead, she aborted her baby, and her condition was very critical. Du Youming witnessed his wife's condition and, fearing that she had taken the wrong medicine, immediately took the medicine residue and the prescription to another pharmacy for verification. It was then discovered that there had been an error in dispensing. Du Youming immediately took the prescription and medicine residue to the local police station and requested an investigation. After the police station learned the circumstances, they conducted an investigation and confirmed that the pharmacy had been negligent. They immediately dispatched a police officer to summon Yuan Shilin, the pharmacy owner who was a native of Changzhou, to the General Bureau for questioning.</p>

<p>Weng Zhinian, a 30-year-old man from Chaozhou, residing at No. 10, Yuanfang Lane, Yuanfang Road, worked as a porter at Jardine's Wharf. His financial situation was usually extremely tight. On the afternoon of the 13th of this month, at 8:00 PM, a hooligan named Along demanded eight dimes that Weng owed him at the entrance of Yuanfang Lane.  When Weng was unable to pay, Along beat him, causing injuries. Weng eventually died suddenly at 7:00 AM on the 15th at No. 352, East Broadway Road, within the Jardine's workshop.  His wife, Madam Weng Yang, reported the situation to the Hongkou Police Station.  Detective Fang Fucheng was dispatched to investigate.  The culprit had already fled.  The body was then transported to the autopsy center on Feren Road. Yesterday morning, a request was made to the First Special District Local Court, which appointed Prosecutor Zhang Zongru, along with two forensic doctors Wei and Zhang, and clerk Wang Zuxun, to the center to examine the body.  Immediately afterward, the court was convened. According to the complaint from the deceased's wife, Weng Yang, the details of the incident were recounted, and she requested justice, etc.  Furthermore, Huang Jiezhi and Lin Zhizhong testified, confirming that they witnessed Along beating the deceased.

<p>The Shanghai Booksellers Association, citing the use of the name "Preparatory Committee of the Books and Stationery Vendors Association" to publish advertisements, has submitted a petition to the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau. The petition states: "It has come to our attention that someone is improperly using the name 'Preparatory Committee of the Books and Stationery Vendors Association,' which has no legal basis, to publish advertisements that interfere with the business freedom of our association's members. We, together with the Instrument and Stationery Association, requested that this be banned. We received approval No. 5988 from your esteemed bureau, which stated: 'Understood. This case has also been presented by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, echoing the previous situation. In addition to issuing instructions to order the Preparatory Committee of the Books and Stationery Vendors Association to cease activities and report on their termination within a specified period, please be informed.' We deeply appreciate your bureau's intention to support legitimate organizations. Unexpectedly, since the 9th of this month, the aforementioned Preparatory Committee, which has not been permitted by law, has repeatedly published advertisements in newspapers such as the Nanjing Central Daily News, Shanghai Education Daily, and Shen Bao, questioning our association. This illegal organization clearly has not complied with your orders. Therefore, we are submitting this document again, along with the advertisements published by the Preparatory Committee in the Central Daily News, etc., requesting your review and strict investigation to prevent those with ulterior motives from deceiving and profiting from the confusion."</p>

<p>Jin Heming, manager of the Nanyang Machinery Factory on Gaogongmiao Bansongyuan Road, and his uncle, Jin Delin (the factory foreman), were recently sued by shareholders Shi Bangti, Xiu Ye, Jiao Ziju, Chen Guifa, etc., in the Local Court for embezzling 60,000 yuan of factory assets.  The plaintiffs stated that the embezzlement occurred in two reports, one from 1924 to 1927 and another from 1927 to 1933, totaling 60,000 yuan.  During the court hearing, the defendant, Jin Heming, also known as Jin Guru, testified that the factory was experiencing significant losses and could not be sustained.  He stated that a shareholders' meeting was held in July 1933, where it was resolved to cease operations and a liquidation committee of seven members was elected to handle all debts and claims. The plaintiffs, Jiao Ziju and Shi Bangti, also attended and signed the resolution, which can be verified.  Shi Bangti was also one of the seven committee members.  The defendant has already filed a civil lawsuit in the Civil Court to confirm the completion of the liquidation, etc. Judge Wu, after reviewing the evidence, declared that the criminal trial would be suspended until the civil trial was resolved.</p>

<p>Doctor Accused of Negligence</p>
<p>Madam Rui, the 28-year-old wife of Zhou Hanjie, a native of Changshu, residing at No. 540, Gonghe Xin Road, Zhabei, developed a fever after childbirth.

Zhou filed a complaint with the Public Security Bureau, and Xu was arrested and detained. Yesterday, a bailiff, Huang Hongsheng, reported the case to the Local Court for an autopsy. After an examination by Prosecutor Zhao, based on the complainant's allegations that the defendant lacked sufficient knowledge and was negligent, it was determined that the negligence could not be determined through a ordinary autopsy. The body was ordered to be sent to the Forensic Institute in Zhenru for an autopsy to avoid any miscarriage of justice.</p>

<p>Unable to Murder His Paramour; Ruan Suisheng Sent to Court for Questioning</p>
<p>Lin Yufeng, a young woman from Jiangsu residing at No. 12, Baxian Cun, Route du Père Robert, in the French Concession, is 23 years old. Her husband, Chen Bingsheng, was involved in the kidnapping case of foundry owner Xiang Yixing and was arrested by the Public Security Bureau and sentenced by the First Special Court to imprisonment. While he appeals, Lin Yufeng has no one to rely on and has cut off her life support. A friend introduced Lin to Ruan Suisheng (also known as Shouzheng, 30 years old, from Shaoxing, residing in Xiangshun Lane, Cashi Road, French Concession), a clerk at the Xu Zhengda Copper and Tin Shop on Beijing Road, who is now her paramour. They have been cohabitating for four months. Initially, Ruan agreed to pay Lin Yufeng a monthly living allowance of 37 yuan. He provided the full amount for the first two months.  In the last two months, Ruan told Lin that he was experiencing financial difficulties and could not afford to pay, suggesting that Lin pawn all her clothing for money. Lin refused and reproached Ruan.  Ruan felt ashamed and resentful. Some days ago, he secretly obtained nitric acid and, taking advantage of Lin Yufeng's absence, opened her leather trunk and poured the acid on dozens of her valuable cotton, silk, and padded garments, worth 500 to 600 yuan, causing the clothes to be completely ruined. He then disappeared and no longer stayed overnight at Lin's place. On the 14th of this month, Lin Yufeng opened the trunk to take out clothes and discovered that the inside was wet and dripping, and the clothes were all ruined. Knowing that Ruan was responsible, she reported the incident to the French Police the next day. On the 16th, Detective Jiang Zhongjia went to Ruan's residence and arrested him. Yesterday, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. Judge Zhang Minsheng interrogated him. Attorney Fei Xizhen from the Police Department explained the case and requested a postponement of the investigation before filing charges. The court examined the warrant and questioned the defendant, who admitted the crime. The court adjourned the hearing to investigate further. The defendant was returned to custody. The plaintiff, Lin Yufeng, told others that the defendant poured the acid during the period from the 9th to the 14th of this month.</p>

<p>United Insurance and Notary Public Office</p>
<p>Accountants Xu Lun and Wang Haifan, etc., in this port, gathered experts from various industries last year and established the United Insurance and Notary Public Office at No. 505, Henan Road.  It was approved by the Ministry of Industry for registration and handles insurance notary public business, assisting both insurance companies and policyholders in achieving a fair and appropriate resolution in the event of fire or water damage claims. Since its establishment, it has accumulated practical experience and deeply understands that the people of our country still lack a thorough understanding of insurance matters.  Because they do not understand insurance regulations, or neglect advance planning, or do not understand the conditions that must be observed during the valid period of the contract, or do not know the appropriate steps to take after an accident, they waste excessive premiums, increase unnecessary burdens, and suffer severe damages that are difficult to recover.  If this situation is not remedied urgently, not only will the benefits of insurance be completely lost, but also social security will be shaken.  Therefore, based on its original intention to serve society and relieve the people of the aforementioned pain and waste, it has added an annual insurance consultation service from July of this year to provide consultations and planning for all sectors at any time, so that premiums are not wasted and, in the event of an accident, are guaranteed to be paid.  It is said that this method is a novelty in the country, and its fees are extremely affordable. The Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau believes that this method can effectively promote insurance benefits and alleviate the pain of policyholders. It is highly commended and has ordered the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to instruct all industries to promote it.</p>

<p>Ling Zhibin, a young and handsome municipal committee member for Pengpu District, is experienced and capable. He was appointed to this position by former Mayor Zhang Dingfan when the city and county were merged in 1928. Since taking office, he has devoted himself to planning various projects, such as water conservancy, roads, and rural areas, and has made many achievements. The National Government has issued orders to commend him. Now, the Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction admires his talent and has specially recruited him for construction work. Therefore, he has submitted his resignation from his position on the Municipal Committee to the Municipal Government.  Upon hearing the news, various local circles unanimously tried to persuade him to stay, but to no avail.

In addition to resigning from his position at the Shanghai Fish Market, Ling also plans to resign from other public and private positions in Shanghai in order to focus on construction work.</p>

<p>The Civil Procedure Law is essential reading for legal practitioners. Schools emphasize the Civil Procedure Law course because all legal acts in society are related to civil law, and the procedure for protecting private rights lies in the Civil Procedure Law. However, the articles are complex and difficult to remember. To fully understand and apply it, it is necessary to rely on a interpretation of the Civil Procedure Law that fully explains and applies it. After the jurist Dai Jixian published his "Interpretation of the New Civil Procedure Law," it was well-received by legal professionals. In addition to interpreting each legal article, its content connects and applies all articles and related laws, making it convenient and practical. The first batch has sold out, and the second batch has now been published and is still being sold at the Shanghai Bar Association.</p>

<p>The Crowded Repair Shop of Ada Radio. The wireless radio repair department established by Ada Company at No. 88, Nanjing Road in this port was established the earliest and has outstanding results. The company was overwhelmed with repair work in the rainy season and added a weekend shift. Now that the hot summer is coming to an end, those requesting repairs are still pouring in. What most distresses the radio owners is that generally, repairers often not only perform poorly after the repair, but even dismantle the parts beyond repair. This situation is never found in this company, which is due to the strict management. The company's attentive service is also a special feature. If the repaired machine breaks down within a short period, the customer is not charged extra. It is appropriate to say that the company is the only high-level radio repair shop in Shanghai.</p>

<p>Dr. Zhang Jiahui Establishes Branch Clinic. Dr. Zhang Jiahui, a graduate of the China Medical College, has studied diligently and is proficient in the strengths of various schools. She was personally taught by the elder Xue Wenyuan and inherited his knowledge. She has been practicing medicine for several years, and her experience has become more abundant. Every patient who seeks treatment knows about Dr. Zhang. It is enough to show the depth of the lady's accomplishment. There is no need to promote her because she is widely known. Ms. Zhang is skilled in the treatment of current diseases, miscellaneous diseases, and gynecology and pediatrics. At this time of year, between summer and autumn, when diseases are prevalent, in order to care for society during an economic panic, she has specially established a clinic inside Xue Wenyuan's clinic at No. 4, Daoda Lane, west of the Avenue Edward VII Police Station. She will be available for consultation every afternoon to benefit the people, charging only two dimes for the appointment fee and providing free medicine to the poor.

<p>(3) Business Methods of Films</p>
<p>The business methods of films can be broadly divided into the following three types:</p>
<p>(1) Revenue Sharing - That is, the ticket revenue from the opening of the film is split between the film company and the theater. However, the percentages vary. The common method is 50% for the film company and 50% for the theater. In addition, there are splits of 40/60, 30/70, or more for the company and less for the theater, or vice versa, depending on the circumstances. Currently, most theaters in Shanghai, both Chinese and foreign, adopt this method.</p>
<p>(2) Film Rental - The theater rents the film from the film company, setting a rental price for a fixed period. The theater shows the film on its own, and the company only collects rent and does not share the revenue. The rental price depends on the situation in each port and the length of time. For example, the price for renting a re-run film should be cheaper. This method is mostly used for good films because the theater is certain that the film will be a box office success. Therefore, it sets a rental price in advance, and the income should be higher than revenue sharing. On the company side, it can also avoid the trouble of revenue sharing.</p>
<p>(3) Purchasing Exclusive Screening Rights - That is, the theater or intermediate manager purchases a copy from the company, setting a price and region. Within that region, the company or other distributors may not screen the same film. This method is used most by distributors in Southeast Asia. For example, Nan Yi Company in Shanghai purchased the exclusive screening rights for Chaplin's "Modern Times." The price has no fixed standard.</p>
<p>(4) The Current Situation of Public Distribution Centers for Various Films</p>
<p>(1) The Current Situation of Various Film Companies - The number of existing companies has decreased significantly compared to before. This is because technological advances and the increase in the audience's level have made it impossible for those who produce crude and insipid works to gain a foothold, as well as the government's strict prohibition of speculation. According to a survey conducted by Lianhua Company, there are currently eleven companies in Shanghai, of which only seven actually produce films. The list is as follows:</p>
<p>Film Companies that Actually Produce Films</p>
<p>Name  Person in Charge  Name Person in Charge</p>
<p>Star Zhang Shichuan Lianhua  Luo Mingyou</p>
<p>Tianyi Shao Zuiweng  Yihua Yan Chuntang</p>

<p>The remaining four companies have companies but do not produce films, as listed on the left:</p>

<p>The film companies that have recently closed down, a total of four, are also listed below:</p>
<p>Dian Tong Du Jiande  Culture</p>
<p>Zhicheng Wang Junda  New Era Ye Qianyu</p>
<p>It is estimated that the total value of the business of various companies in Shanghai is 5 million yuan, of which Star is 1.2 million yuan, Lianhua is 1 million yuan, Yihua, Tianyi, and Diantong are 500,000 yuan each, and other companies together account for 1.3 million yuan. Now that Diantong has closed down, Xinhua can take its place. The larger companies are described in detail below:</p>
<p>Star Film Company - The company was founded in 1922 and is the oldest of the existing film companies. The capital is 2 million yuan. It is a limited company organization. General Manager Zhang Shichuan and Business Manager Zhou Jianyun are both founders of the company. The main factory is located at Fenglin Bridge, and two branch factories are located at the old site of Yucheng Company on Bubai Road. Its products are quite beneficial to society. The first factory is entirely old personnel, and the second factory has newly hired Ying Yunwei and Yuan Mu to participate. Its purpose is to adapt its products to a variety of needs. The company currently has about 400 employees. The number of products produced by the company in recent years is recorded below:</p>
<p>Year 1929 1930 1931 1932 1933</p>

<p>Xu Zijun, a Ningbo native residing at No. 10 Wanxiang Lane, Aerjin Road, aged 29, went to the Jianermei Massage Parlor at No. 861 North Sichuan Road at around 1 PM the day before yesterday for a bath. He was attended to and massaged by Wang Xiangyun (also known as Wang Zhang, aged 20), a woman from Huzhou. Shortly after Ms. Wang went to another room, she suddenly heard a sound coming from a box in the room. She rushed back and discovered that two silver coins and a key ring were missing from a small tin box placed on the massage table. At the time, because Xu Zijun was a customer, and the loss was minimal, she did not make an issue of it. Unexpectedly, around 4 PM, when Xu was getting ready to leave, Ms. Wang shook his hand and suddenly discovered that a gold ring she was wearing on her finger had vanished. At this point, Ms. Wang began to suspect that Xu was not a good person, so she instructed a tea server, Weng Ali, to chase after him and question him. An argument ensued between them on the road. Policeman No. 2379 arrived and took Xu into custody at the Hongkou Police Station. Two silver coins and a key ring were found on Xu, but the gold ring was nowhere to be found despite a thorough search. The police suspected that Xu had swallowed the ring, so they sent him to the Public Concession Hospital. After an examination by the doctor, it was confirmed that the gold ring was indeed in his stomach. Xu was admitted to the hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, the police's lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, filed a lawsuit against Xu in the Special First Court according to the law, and recounted the details of the case, requesting a postponement. Additionally, the masseuse Wang Zhang recounted the above situation. Judge Ye Shengchao reviewed the testimony and ordered the case to be postponed for a hearing this Friday.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 13th of this month, a young man and woman checked into the Wu Palace Inn at the intersection of Fujian Road and Fuzhou Road, booking room number 429 for their stay. The man claimed to be Wang Tiansheng, aged 27, and the woman was his wife, aged 25, both from Anhui province. They had been staying in the room for several days, rarely venturing out, and nothing seemed amiss. Unexpectedly, around 6:50 PM yesterday (the 17th), tea servers suddenly heard faint groaning sounds coming from the room. They knocked and received no response, which aroused suspicion. They forced the door open and entered, finding the two lying stiffly on the bed, pale and on the verge of death. Alarmed, they immediately reported to the police station, who dispatched a vehicle to rush them to the hospital for treatment. It was determined that they had committed suicide by poisoning. However, due to the severity of the poisoning, they both died shortly after. A suicide note was found beside them, addressed to the manager of the Wu Palace Inn. It stated that they had failed in business in Hangzhou and had lost all hope, so they had decided to commit suicide together. They also stated that the money owed for the room could be covered by selling their luggage. The police are currently trying to locate their family members.</p>

In Shanghai, there were heavy thunderstorms after 4 PM yesterday. The Ningbo-bound Xinning Shao, Xin Beijing, and Wintai-bound ships sailed as scheduled because the customs had not hoisted typhoon signals, but they were instructed to navigate cautiously, first reaching Songkou to observe the wind and waves before determining their course out to sea. Other ships, such as the Nan Hua-bound vessels, will sail tomorrow and had no issues.</p>

<p>Special Correspondent of the Central News Agency, Berlin, 17th Broadcasting: The Eleventh Olympiad has come to a successful conclusion since its opening on August 1st. The closing ceremony was held at 8:45 PM on the 16th. German Head of State Hitler arrived at the venue at 5 PM and did not leave until the ceremony was over. The ceremony was solemn and simple. Representatives of each country entered the venue one after another, holding their national flags (one representative per country), in the same order as the opening ceremony, except that Germany was last this time. After the representatives of the 51 countries stood in their positions, the President of the Assembly, Lado, delivered a brief closing speech. Two thousand German students sang the assembly song, and several female students in uniform hung wreaths on the flagpole, fired thirteen cannons, lowered the assembly flag, rang the assembly bell, and extinguished the assembly flame. Representatives of each country left the venue with their flags, and five strong men carried the assembly flag, while eight men in white uniforms escorted the flag to the podium. The Mayor of Los Angeles, America, handed the flag over to the Mayor of Berlin for safekeeping. The mayors of both cities gave brief speeches. The chairman also announced that the first session was held in Greece, the last session in Los Angeles, this session in Berlin, and the next session will be held in Japan. The national flags of Greece, Germany and Japan were raised on the flagpole, and then lowered one after another. The audience at the venue sang the German national anthem and cheered for Hitler. The solemn and grand closing ceremony was thus completed.</p>
<p>Reuters Berlin, 16th: Nearly 100,000 people attended tonight's closing ceremony of the Olympic Games, including Hitler. More than a dozen arc lights illuminated the entire venue. The Olympic flame, which had been burning since the opening, was extinguished. The assembly flag was gradually lowered. In silence, the public gave the Olympic salute. After a minute of silence, a loudspeaker announced, "I now command the youth of the world to go to Tokyo." This was followed by a high-pitched singing of the German national anthem, the National Socialist Party song, and the Olympic song. The conference then closed.</p>
<p>Lado's Closing Remarks</p>
<p>Havas Berlin, 16th: The Eleventh Olympic Games, since its opening on the first of this month, half a month has passed in an instant. All events have been completed. Until 9 PM tonight, Count de Lairado, the chairman of the International Olympic Committee representing Belgium, announced the closing and said, "On behalf of the International Olympic Committee, I would like to express our sincere gratitude to the German head of state Hitler, the German people, and the Berlin authorities, the organizers of the games with enthusiastic emotions. I hereby declare that the Eleventh Olympic Games has come to an end, and I invite the youth of all countries to gather in Tokyo for the Twelfth Olympic Games in 1940. It is hoped that the Olympic Games can be held on time in a pleasant and peaceful atmosphere. The Olympic flame will be passed down from generation to generation and will never be extinguished, and the will of all mankind will be influenced by the Olympic spirit, becoming more noble, pure and brave."</p>
<p>One of the Most Memorable Scenes</p>
<p>(National Maritime News Agency) Berlin, August 16: Today, at the World Games venue, where the atmosphere was tense and emotions were high, outstanding athletes from 52 countries officially bid farewell to each other. This solemn closing ceremony is undoubtedly one of the most memorable scenes in modern sports history. The venue was packed to the brim, and the seats reserved for journalists were also occupied by many nobles and guests from various countries. At the same time, the streets of Berlin were filled with enthusiastic people, the number of whom was impossible to calculate. The total number of guests and tourists who came from abroad over the weekend to witness the spectacle of the World Games was over one million. Before dawn, the World Games venue was already full, because those who had obtained tickets were still afraid that they would not be able to get a seat, so they entered the venue early. The order began at 2:30, first with equestrian performances and the awarding of yesterday's prizes. Prime Minister Hitler entered the venue at 3:00 PM sharp, and everyone stood up to pay their respects and sing the German national anthem.</p>
<p>The Five-Ring Flag Slowly Descends</p>
<p>When all the competitions were over, it was 7:30 PM, and the closing ceremony was held. The athletes from all countries entered the venue in uniform, very solemn and tidy, no less than on the day of the opening two weeks ago. All the athletes lined up and passed the viewing platform first, then gathered in the center of the sports field. When all the athletes were in place, the Chairman of the World Games Committee, Lardur, addressed the crowd. At the same time, the speech by Count Coubertin, the restorer of the World Games, was also published on the bulletin board, stating that "The World Games torch can illuminate the future, so that there can be more brave, pure and progressive human beings." When a horn sounded, the heroes of each country handed their national flags back to the referees in front of the viewing platform. The national flags were then tied with laurel wreaths. As the music was melodious and the cannons sounded, the five-ring World Games flag slowly descended, and the World Games torch was gradually extinguished. As the military band played a farewell song, the national flags of the fifty-two countries in the venue also slowly descended. The applause in the venue was deafening. Everyone who participated in the closing ceremony had a very deep and solemn impression.</p>
<p>Statistics of the Audience at the Conference</p>
<p>The Number Reaches 1.2 Million People</p>
<p>(Allied News Agency, Berlin Special Correspondent, 16th) The total number of people who gathered in Berlin to watch the Eleventh Olympic World Games was 1.2 million, of which 1.05 million came from all over Germany, and the remaining 150,000 were people from distant foreign countries who came to visit the World Games. Therefore, during the conference period, the number of admission tickets sold on the 16th, including those sold in advance, reached a total of 4.5 million, and the number of people who watched various sports was an average of 281,250 per day, with a total of 7.5 million marks (approximately 10.7 million Japanese yen). However, the total amount of money spent by the organizing committee on the construction of sports venues and various assembly venues and equipment in preparation for the opening of the conference also reached 6.5 million marks (approximately 9.3 million Japanese yen). The actual profit of the committee was one million marks (approximately 1.4 million Japanese yen). It is said that the amount of money lost in Berlin may also be a surprising number with a question mark attached.</p>
<p>Mr. Cha Contributes to the Conference</p>
<p>(Havas News Agency, Berlin, 17th) The Olympic Games held here were very successful. Cha Meosden, the leader of the German sports community, contributed a lot. General Goering, the Governor of Prussia, has recently been appointed as a consultant to reward his merits.</p>

<p>Havas, Berlin, 16th: Today is the last day of the Eleventh Olympic Games. The equestrian competition was held in the afternoon. German Head of State Hitler, Bulgarian King Boris, and German cabinet members all came to visit. Tens of thousands of spectators attended, making it a grand occasion.

German Lieutenant Hess unfortunately fell off his horse and broke his collarbone in yesterday's equestrian competition. He went on stage with his injuries today. Hess is a famous German knight. Germany's acquisition of this award is due in no small part to the Wang family. If Hess could not continue this competition, Germany's ability to win this gold medal is uncertain. When Hess came on stage today, his left arm still had splints. However, Hess's performance was still as good as ever, winning high praise from the audience.</p>

<p>(Berlin Special Dispatch) The king of Chinese football, Mr. Li Huitang, is so famous that almost no one knows him. Although he has grown older in recent years, his rich experience and effective command are still the only talents in our country's football world. According to what Mr. Li told the reporter, during this European campaign, a total of 23 football friendly matches were played. Except for four draws, they never surrendered. When asked about his feelings about the China-England match, he replied that he had never set foot in Europe, and he did not know the strength of the European teams. Moreover, in football matches, if the opponent is strong, our team will perform well, so victory or defeat is not certain, but the result of the performance will definitely give others a good impression. The reporter informed him that the fatigue of the journey had a great impact on his strength. Mr. Li said that fortunately, there were more than ten days for our people to rest, so it was not too late.</p>
<p>Miss Yang Xiuqiong and Miss Li Sen had dinner at the Nanjing Hotel on the evening of the 26th. More than a dozen people were sitting at the same table, including a receptionist and translator, and Ms. Wang Nanxi, a female student studying in Germany. Yang and Li both had smiles on their faces and ate very hard.</p>
<p>Since the schedule of the World Games football match was arranged, after China's first match against England, the reception office of the Chinese Students Association in Germany immediately handled the purchase of tickets. It is known that more than 350 students have registered to buy tickets, which shows their enthusiasm. It is heard that the ticket prices are divided into three types: 4 marks (with seats), 2 marks and 1 mark (without seats).</p>

<p>(Special Correspondent of the Central News Agency, Berlin Broadcasting, 17th) Our athletes who participated in the World Games, except for the football team, have already left Berlin. The sports inspection team is scheduled to go to five countries, including Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, and Finland, tonight to inspect the sports industry. They are scheduled to go to Italy in early September to meet with the athlete delegation and return home. The athlete delegation will stay in Germany temporarily and is scheduled to leave Berlin on September 1st and take the Conte Rosso wheel from Italy on the 4th to return home. They are expected to arrive in Shanghai at the end of September. This afternoon, our country's ambassador to Germany, Cheng Tianfang, hosted a banquet for all the athletes. Tomorrow, the All-Europe Students Association in Germany will host a banquet for all the athletes at Challo and invite the basketball team to perform. From the 24th to the 27th, the athletes will be divided into groups to visit the German Socialist Party Youth Corps, the Labor Corps, and factories in various industries. Government representative Dai Jitao, the Dean, after participating in the closing ceremony, is scheduled to go to various European countries for inspection the day after tomorrow. The head of the delegation, Wang Zhengyan, will go to Russia and then go to Italy in September to return home with the athlete delegation. The Secretary-General, Shen Siliang, is scheduled to return home via Siberia on the 11th or 21st of this month. The results of this conference were satisfactory, but our country failed. From this, it can be seen that our country not only has no political status in the world, but also cannot compete with other countries in sports. This is really heartbreaking. What I have heard and seen during this participation in the World Games is even more stimulating. If the people of the whole country do not work hard, our country's international status will never be improved, and the promotion of sports is by no means a matter that can be done by training a few athletes. The people of the whole country must develop together and pay attention to national health. It should start from young children, so that the people of the whole country have a healthy and strong physique, then the future of China will be promising.</p>

<h3 id="e165">City Education Bureau Issues Order to All Schools: Prohibiting Female Teachers from Perming Hair and Applying Cosmetics, Emphasizing that Teachers Should Lead by Example and Enhance the Effectiveness of Moral Education <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Education Bureau issued an instruction to all levels of schools under its jurisdiction, stating: "According to a report submitted by the Shanghai Primary School Teachers' Association, the purpose of the New Life Movement is to train the public to develop clean and simple habits and cultivate the spirit of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame. Although the specifics are minor, the effect is significant. Once advocated, it is promoted nationwide. Various organs in the city have repeatedly received orders from higher authorities, instructing them on the steps to take. Female students in various schools have been prohibited from various bad habits such as perming hair and applying cosmetics, and considerable results have been achieved. Recently, it has been observed that female teachers in various schools, who hold teaching positions and are regarded as role models, often have not eliminated various bad habits such as applying cosmetics and perming hair. It is inappropriate for them to serve society and educate children in this way. In recent years, international trade has seen women's cosmetics expenses as a major import item. With the country's affairs in such a state, how can we bear to engage in such time-consuming and money-wasting activities? The association feels deeply concerned and dares to request that your bureau issue an order to all female teachers in various schools to comply. As the ancients said, 'Please start with me.' Hopefully, the future of the New Life Movement will be promoted and developed through the efforts of women, and the future of education will advance boundlessly through the rectification of female teachers. Based on the above, it is found that the bad habits of female students in various schools, such as applying cosmetics and perming their hair, have already been strictly prohibited by the bureau. Now that female teachers in various schools are regarded as role models, they should lead by example and eliminate various bad habits such as applying cosmetics and perming their hair to enhance the effectiveness of moral education. Based on the previous report, all female teachers in various schools are hereby ordered to comply. This order is hereby issued."</p>

After several days of sideways movement, it suddenly turned firm, mostly induced by swap transactions in the supply and demand of chips. For many days, those who had been selling the 10th suddenly covered their positions, which was particularly noteworthy. There were no good news in the environment. The Gui incident remained as it was, and the situation in the East was still quite tense. Even Wang Kemin's trip to the north had nothing to do with the entry and exit. However, those who were generally nervous believed that there was a good impression with 96, so those who were generally accustomed to raising the price of 96 believed that the time had come and suddenly raised the price by 4-5 jiao. The future cannot be viewed with optimism just because of the increase. Yesterday's situation was that the opening in the morning was still virtual in the hearts of the traders. Types Wuding were still a little less than 1 jiao to 1.5 jiao. Type C of this month was still sluggish due to the outflow of spot goods in the 4th. Starting from the far term, there were still more people covering their positions. The 10th also had purchases, and the market price gradually turned firm. The closing market was revitalized, and the trend was unanimously higher. The 4th and 11th continued to sell, and Type B was still weak and powerless. The rest generally rose by 1 jiao to 1.5 jiao. The opening in the afternoon was extremely firm, and the market price soared, gradually becoming stronger. Although the 4th and 11th continued to sell, the 10th, 54th, and scattered retail investors absorbed quite fiercely. The market price unanimously rose again by 1-2 jiao to 4.5 jiao. The closing was as firm as ever, and the rising trend was still strong. Most bonds rose by another 3-4 jiao. The 96 also gradually rose in rumors and misinformation, rising 4-5 jiao throughout the day. Uniformity and each government bond rose by 3-4 jiao to 9 jiao. The total number of transactions was 8,635,000 yuan. Here is a table comparing the results of the rises and falls (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<p>--New Cotton Buying Interest Also Strong--</p>
<p>--Distant Months Trade Above 1 Yuan--</p>
<p>Spot month cotton prices opened lower, following declining US cotton prices to 5 pounds. This resulted in a reduction of the value of cotton Robbies by one-half. Spot cotton prices generally increased by 2 to 3 jiao. Tensions in the market increased, owing to unfavorable conditions, including overcast skies and continuous torrential rains and flooding in the Subei region, damaging crops. Buyer activity increased as a result. After the first session, prices climbed progressively higher. All months of Spot cotton saw increases of 3, 4, and 5 jiao respectively compared to previous closing prices, while August alone increased by 1.1 jiao. Reported sales included 3400 bales from Jifeng, 1300 bales from Yuda, 1800 bales from Gengfeng, 1700 bales from Lianchang, 1700 bales from Shenji, 4000 bales from Changfeng, 1400 bales from Shengyuan, 1600 bales from Xincheng, and 5100 bales from Zhaoye. Buyers included Hengyi, who purchased 2100 bales, and Yuhang, who purchased 1800 bales, Mingde purchased 5500 bales, Hexing 1300 bales, Changyu 1000 bales, Renfeng 1000 bales, Yicheng 1900 bales, Runhang 1500 bales, Xiecheng 1900 bales, Fuhang 4100 bales, Yongda 1000 bales, and Yihang 1100 bales. Highs and lows in half-day trading are listed below.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Merchants Stay Cautious</p>
<p>Current cotton consumption is moderate, with factories adopting a cautiously observant attitude, resulting in scant trading activity.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Yarn Prices Boosted by Cotton, Spot Yarn Market Highly Active, Jincheng Yarn Opens at 2000 Bales <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is trending firm and the overall situation is stable. Yarn sales are brisk, and market sentiment is optimistic. Lack of new selling is tightening up order books. Furthermore, poor weather has caused cotton prices to rise, which in turn has led to a further strengthening of the interconnected yarn market. Yong’an Mill released 2000 bales of Jincheng 20s yarn, priced between 214.5 and 216 yuan, for delivery in November and December, and reported that all had been sold.</p>
<p>Mingde Buys Up Balances of Spot Yarn</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened with prices showing listless and sluggish activity, partly due to overseas yarn and cotton markets being flat and without energy, contributing to poor market sentiment. Unexpectedly, after the second session, it was reported that yarn sales were strong. Mingde again began taking up balances of contracts, which strengthened the market. All months rose from 8 or 9 jiao to 1.2 or 3 yuan respectively, while Gengfeng and Changfeng closed out numerous long positions, contributing significantly to market activity. Upon the third closing, short positions in the market were covered up. Spot yarn prices closed with all months increasing from 5, 7, and 8 jiao to 1 yuan, in comparison to previous closing prices. Reported sales included 200 bales from Dafu, 950 bales from Tongji, 1300 bales from Gengfeng, 500 bales from Changji, 500 bales from Ruida, 550 bales from Shenji, 2200 bales from Changfeng, 1100 bales from Runhang, and 700 bales from Shengyuan. Buyers included Juxing, who purchased 1700 bales, Mingde purchased 3200 bales, Xingchang purchased 700 bales, Shenkang purchased 400 bales, Weiyu purchased 500 bales, Dachangcheng purchased 600 bales, Dachang purchased 500 bales, and Yongda purchased 450 bales.

<p>Following initial sharp falls early in the week in line with US cotton reports, prices have recovered slightly on the back of bargain-hunting by merchants and European exporters. Consumer demand from India and overseas remains subdued, and near-term trading remains constrained by manipulator activity. Crop yields remain a concern due to lack of rain in some areas. Overall, further developments remain to be seen. Weekly figures for this past week are appended below. (Units in thousands of bales)</p>

<p>American cotton opening: Liverpool news was unfavorable. Foreign merchants sold shipments to Bombay and Liverpool. Local bulls also closed out positions. All months fell 5 to 12 points. Currently, the market's focus is on changes in the international political situation and the increase in Southern hedging. Dealers bought on dips. New Orleans also purchased here, but sellers sold on rallies. Subsequently, consumption increased, the West continued to be dry, and cotton quality declined, leading to a rebound. As a result, spot prices fell 5 points, futures fell 5 points to rose 1 point. English cotton spot prices fell 17 points, futures fell 14 points. Indian cotton was initially firm due to purchases by European exporters but then fell due to large-scale selling by operators. It then rebounded due to purchases by speculators. Overall, Pingguoer fell 1.25 rupees, Aola fell 4 rupees, and Bainanxi fell 3.75 rupees. Original telegram recorded on the left. (Telegram of the 15th)</p>
<h3 id="e186">Piece Goods: Smuggled Goods Decrease; Cotton Cloth Sales to the North See Renewed Increase; Japanese Fine Cloth Lacks New Transactions Across All Regions; Overseas Sales Are Quite Good, So There Is No Fear of Oversupply <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market: Unbleached and printed piece goods mostly maintained the previous weekend's prices. Eastern fine cloth and fine twill experienced a decrease in new transactions across all regions because dye factories had already prepared sufficient quantities of white fine cloth and fine twill for this month. Therefore, there was a wait-and-see attitude towards fine cloth and fine twill, with no immediate plans, resulting in a sharp decline in the momentum of Eastern fine cloth and fine twill. However, Japanese factories did not feel any oversupply because sales to the South Seas were quite good. But the market had already become flat and fatigued because of it. Yesterday, the market price for each piece of fine cloth, fine twill, and grey cloth from various dealers decreased slightly, about 2.5 fen per piece. The Tianjin syndicate in the Northern route, which had been quiet for a long time, saw a sudden increase in shipments of Shanghai goods due to the decrease in smuggled goods since last week. They continuously purchased over 200 boxes of Qingfeng Factory's heavy crepe, Jianmei呢, Mingxing呢, and other goods, as well as over 300 pieces of this factory's 16-pound coarse cloth, light-pound coarse cloth, and group twill. Purchases of Southern route Sichuan and Hunan printed velvet and white velvet were also strong. However, Guizhou, Yunnan, Guangdong, and Guangxi were all extremely sluggish. Guangdong is about to implement currency reform. After the situation stabilizes and financial adjustments are made, there may be a large number of purchases.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Grains: Strong Bullish Sentiment; Futures Flour Rises Universally <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, all months showed a universal upward trend. The quoted price of foreign wheat had little fluctuation. The opening price of the current month was initially stable because the appetite of Northern buyers had turned sluggish. But because market sentiment was good, and short covering emerged, it rose from 9 fen to 9.75 li. Therefore, the opening prices for September and subsequent months were all raised by 2 fen due to the bullish sentiment around them. Currently, market sentiment is rising unabated, partly driven by Japanese purchases of wheat, and partly by the promotion of increased agricultural production. Moreover, public and private propaganda suggests that domestic prices are much cheaper compared to foreign countries, leading to upward sentiment with almost no setbacks in recent months. After one round of trading, the price of the current month rose again due to heavy short covering, while the rest generally hovered around. Observing future trends, it is feared that due to wheat exports, it will be difficult to see an easing of prices.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Both Futures and Spot Wheat Rise by Five or Six Fen <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday in the futures wheat market, after the morning opening, each month presented an image of initial stability followed by brisk trading. The opening price of the current month, with little fluctuation in foreign wheat, remained at 4.967 yuan. However, when trading extended to September, market sentiment soared because the government paid attention to food supplies, and warehouses in various places had to be prepared. The opening price immediately rose by 3 to 4 fen. After one round of trading, the situation for the current month also tightened, and the highest price once broke through 5.02 yuan. Trading for other months was brisk, and prices stabilized. The future situation will depend on whether the export issue can be resolved, before the market can stabilize. In the spot wheat market, prices rose again by 5 fen due to customer buybacks and good factory appetite. The opening price for Linghuaiguan, Zhangbaling, and Yaowan wheat was 5.05 yuan, Liuhe wheat was 4.55 yuan, the secondary grade was 4.8 jiao, Jiangxi wheat was 8.78 yuan, Quanjiao wheat was 5 yuan, and the settlement was 4.95 yuan. Jiangxinzhou wheat was 4.95 yuan, Puzhen wheat was 4.9 jiao, and the settlement was 4.856 yuan, Taicang wheat was 4.81 yuan, Huaian wheat was 5 yuan, and the settlement was 4.95 yuan, Wuhu wheat was 4.87 yuan. Fuxin bought 7,000 bags, and Fufeng bought 1,000 bags. As for the Japanese side, there are no movements reported.</p>

<p>For standard foreign-origin sesame, the exchange does not conduct auctions because there are still about two months before the new crop arrives. However, the miscellaneous grains syndicate already has forward trading in the association's market. The opening price was 11.5 yuan the week before. Recently, with inquiries from foreign merchants (namely Germany and Italy), the market has been exceptionally tight. It was heard that the price had already risen to 12.6 yuan the day before yesterday. Yesterday, it initially tightened to 12.65 yuan, and finally reached as high as 12.7 yuan, with a situation where buyers could not cover their positions. Recently, China's agricultural exports have seen expansion. In the midst of an economic recession, there is a possibility of reversal.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Ke Xian rice market situation: although arrivals were strong, with 6,000 to 7,000 bags arriving at the port daily, sales were even more active, with daily sales of over 10,000 bags. Yesterday, local inland buyers were even more greedy, and there were also inquiries from the Northern syndicate. Moreover, due to reports that the authorities, in view of this year's bumper harvest, advocated raising agricultural prices to help rural areas, on the one hand expediting storage in warehouses throughout the country, and on the other hand finding other outlets, market sentiment became even more optimistic. Through smooth trading, the market price immediately jumped by 2 to 3 jiao, and market sentiment continued to be optimistic. Yesterday, the entire city opened with 4,810 bags of Jiangxi rice, 710 bags of Wentai rice, 2,500 bags of Hankou new unpolished rice, 780 bags of Jiangbei rice, and 1,500 bags of Dajiao rice. Purchasing appetite was not very strong.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the total source of goods from various syndicates was on the 15th and 16th, with a total of over 3,000 shi. Sales in the local market of this kind became less urgent. Qingdao syndicate bought more than 400 bags. Therefore, although the market situation was considered settled, the situation appeared to be weakening. The prices of both thick and thin japonica rice were unchanged. Duyangjian rice was similar. Yin Yuan rice was selling steadily. A total of more than 1,000 shi arrived in Dongxin, sales were slightly less than before, and prices remained steady.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, very few goods arrived in the port from Hexia. Sales of white japonica rice on the 11th and 12th were sluggish, and Yin Yuan rice retail sales were still active. Yang Du Bu Ke Jian rice was normal, and thin rice was scarce. The price of high-quality white japonica rice was stable, and the secondary grade was tight. Yang Du Bu Ke Jian rice saw a slight increase of a few fen, and thin rice prices did not change. Yin Yuan rice was also tight by a few fen. Slightly more Dongxin japonica rice arrived, and sales were mediocre, with stable prices.</p>

<p>The silk market in this port is still driven by strong buying interest from users, especially for Shandong yellow and white factory silk and Sichuan Yang return silk. In the past two days, a total of 62 boxes of the above-mentioned silk were sold, with prices remaining as firm as usual. Yesterday, Yokohama silk prices increased slightly by 32 yuan. Foreign merchants are still in the process of inspecting silk for export, and after the implementation of mandatory inspection in this port, the trading procedures for export silk products have not yet been unified (silk manufacturers and exporters all hold different opinions regarding the improvement of procedures). Therefore, export silk transactions are inevitably affected to some extent.</p>

<p>Yesterday's tea market was still trending downwards. Arrivals of Zhenmei green tea from dealers and the removal of bud tea are still sluggish. Common dealer goods from areas such as Sexi and Siyuan were purchased by Xiehe, Yihe, Tongfu, and Du De companies, but because prices from Morocco were tight, Chinese merchants were weak-hearted. The market had already opened at around 70 yuan, and Su'an and Shexian goods fell to 57 or 58 yuan, a drop of another 2 or 3 yuan from before. Needle eyebrow pearl tea and other items also saw some sales, but Qining black tea was still sluggish yesterday, and the market situation was gradually declining.</p>
<p>According to a report from the Tea Industry Association, the green tea market returned to a static state yesterday, and Zhenmei transactions were sparse. Guanxi Baitu Company, which sold well last week, also showed signs of slackness. Only the 500+ amount of Zhenmei from Central Anhui, which was agreed upon last Saturday at a price of 65 to 70 yuan, was officially transacted yesterday. Jinlong, a major Ping Shui tea dealer, continued to import Tianxiang and Nenyu. In addition, Xiehe handled 870 boxes of colored pearl tea at a price of 56 to 58 yuan.</p>

<p>Since the mid-market decline of orchid bamboo branches, the price of Zhangzhou products has not been able to keep up and has recently risen again. Therefore, the source is scarce, and the trend is gradually turning around. Yesterday, it was heard that higher-priced goods had already risen by about 1 yuan. However, calculating based on the production price, it is still difficult to break even. Therefore, dealers still have some inventory and are waiting to see, and have not yet disposed of it. If later batches arrive in small quantities, the market may have to tighten further.</p>
<p>A small number of orchid seeds from the previous initial batches were offered at very high prices. Recently, as regular grade goods have been released into the market, the quantity has gradually increased. Yesterday, it was heard that hundreds and dozens of boxes had been offered, which was 3 to 4 yuan less than the previous round. The subsequent price drop is already close to 10 yuan. It has been observed that the quality of this local product is quite good, not only is it yellow, bright, and fragrant, but the texture is also relatively dry. However, it seems that it is not clean enough, which is a defect. Operators should improve this and remove the sand and debris in order to expand sales.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the market saw little change, with few transactions. The guild set the price for No. 4 refined white sugar spot at 21.85 yuan, but no deal was made. Re-export goods were priced at 6.8 yuan. Eastern white sugar remained soft, with No. 4 spot at 21.5 yuan, and re-export goods down by a fraction at 6.5 yuan. A deal was made for No. 8 spot YJ mark at 21.12 yuan, and some deals were even made at a slightly lower price. Otherwise, there were few fluctuations. Domestic green and red sugar sales have been quiet recently, and trading companies have reduced their activity. The market is showing signs of softening, but prices in various production areas remain firm. According to a telegram from Guangzhou yesterday, Diao Qing sugar is priced at 10.8 yuan, and adding all external fees makes it difficult to profit.</p>
<p>The joint company held its first tender of Cantonese sugar for the week yesterday. The total quota was 12,644 bags. The prices for goods that arrived earlier remained the same. However, the refined white sugar produced by the Shunde factory was of better quality, and the tender price was raised by one jiao. 3,805 bags of "Five Rams" coarse white sugar from Shunde factory were sold at 21.6 yuan, and another 280 bags from the City New Factory were sold at 21.4 yuan, and 350 bags from Quxi Factory were sold at 20.9 yuan, and 90 bags of City Center sand white were sold at 19.3 yuan, totaling 4,525 bags.</p>

<h3 id="e196">Opening Remarks <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— (Skinny Wren)</p>
<p>Although I have never been to Guangdong, this vibrant cradle of revolution has long left a deep impression on my heart. The deepest impression, in particular, is the Guangzhou Uprising on the 29th day of the third month of the Xinhai year, which carved a bloody path for the revolutionary cause. Seventy-two people shed their blood, lost their heads, and generously sacrificed themselves. At the time, I sang for them, cried for them, and grew weary with sorrow for them. For more than twenty years, what has been constantly on my mind is the Huanghuagang, where those seventy-two martyrs lie in eternal rest; and because of Huanghuagang, I am reminded of Guangdong, the sacred place that initiated the revolution.</p>
<p>This summer, when Chen Bonan mobilized his troops and stirred up trouble, with swords drawn and bows stretched, I was apprehensive, deeply fearing that the seventy-two martyrs who sacrificed themselves without any rights would not even be able to rest in peace under Huanghuagang. Fortunately, the generals of Guangdong all understood the greater good and opposed the civil war. On the banks of Yue Wang Terrace, the bright breeze and clear moon reappeared, allowing Guangdong, which had been outwardly united but inwardly divided for the past seven years, to return from the hands of a tyrant to the banner of the central government. Rejoicing in the accomplishment of unification and the hope for the country, I created a special Guangdong section.</p>
<h3 id="e197">A Revolutionary Pioneer of Guangdong <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Ziwei</p>
<p>A guest who knows anecdotes about the uprising in eastern Guangdong told me about Mr. Yu Yuzhi's past support for the revolution.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu was a native of Taishan in Guangdong. His family was wealthy and ran a silver shop in Hong Kong. He was generous and liked to make friends. He was fluent in dialects, proficient in foreign languages, and possessed foresight from a young age. Seeing that powerful neighbors were watching like tigers, the Chinese people were in a state of slumber, the Manchu barbarians were in power, and the court was in disarray, Mr. Yu was deeply concerned. When Premier Sun Yat-sen passed through Hong Kong to promote the revolution, they became friends. He followed Premier Sun on travels between Nanyang and Singapore, and often interacted with veteran party members such as Chen Shaobai, Li Jitang, Yun Lie, Hu Zhantang, Feng Ziyou, and Xie Yingbo. At that time, the Qing court was strictly arresting party members, and Mr. Yu hid himself in business, remaining unknown to the public. Therefore, he secretly shouldered the responsibility of relaying messages, ensuring smooth communication, and his contributions in providing financial assistance to party members in need were particularly outstanding. After the Xinhai Revolution, he raised a large sum of money to assist Premier Sun, ensuring a source of funds and preventing shortages. However, Mr. Yu's family also declined. When Li Yutang was the head of the finance department, Mr. Yu was appointed as the head of the finance department by Mr. Hu Zhantang, but he ultimately declined the appointment, because Li was already in that position and it was not appropriate to take his place. He only recommended his nephew Chengqing to serve as the head of the treasury for more than ten years. When Premier Sun was stationed in Guangdong, Mr. Yu submitted a memorial offering suggestions on how to connect with Hong Kong merchants to provide assistance. He was invited to adopt the suggestions and sent Mr. Sun Zhesheng as a representative, carrying a handwritten letter and other documents, to the Tianxiang Foreign Firm in Hong Kong. Accompanied by Mr. Yu, he met with Liu, Wei, and other Hong Kong gentlemen to discuss cooperation, and the matter was successfully concluded. In the twelfth year of the Republic, Premier Sun established his government in the Southwest and was stationed at the Henan Cement Factory, gathering righteous troops from various provinces to plan the suppression of rebels. At that time, Mr. Yu was staying in Tianjin and immediately commissioned Comrade Yang Huiji to go south to offer suggestions, which were again approved by Premier Sun, who immediately appointed Mr. Yu as a member of the Central Finance Committee, but Mr. Yu declined due to illness. In recent years, he has been engaged in business, but has encountered frequent setbacks. Now, as an elderly man of sixty-eight, he is still running around in Shanghai, seeking a small profit to make a living. He has six sons. The eldest is employed by Taikoo Dockyard in Hong Kong, the third and fourth are employed by Texaco Oil Company in Hong Kong, the fifth lives at sea and runs the Dahua Lee Yeast business, and the youngest is still studying. Mr. Yu does not admire wealth or seek fame. He does not rely on his younger generation for support. His successful retirement is also commendable.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Guangzhou's Teahouses <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Sheli</p>
<p>The people of Guangzhou's addiction to tea is probably the greatest in China.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, they rush to the teahouse. At the entrance of the teahouse, there is always a newspaper stand selling all kinds of newspapers. These newspaper stands rarely sell them; they are almost always rented to teahouse patrons to take to the teahouse to read. The rental price is five copper coins per copy. Some more refined teahouse patrons throw down five copper coins, take a newspaper, and head to the teahouse, ready to while away the morning.</p>
<p>The size and number of Guangzhou's teahouses are also probably the greatest in China. Almost every bustling street has a large teahouse, decorated very luxuriously and cleanly, with many female waitresses. Some customers drink tea, read the newspaper, and flirt with the waitresses, appearing extremely leisurely amidst their busy lives. This kind of leisurely scene can only be seen in Guangzhou's teahouses.</p>
<p>Running back and forth in the teahouse are vendors selling all kinds of dim sum. The number of dim sum items is also unmatched elsewhere. The plates are especially small. One bun is also on one plate, and one piece of cake is also on one plate. Sometimes these plates fill an entire table, but your stomach is still not full.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, tea is always brewed in teapots, but in Guangzhou teahouses, it is all served in gaiwans, with a small cup, and you pour it yourself. This often causes those not used to it to spill water all over the table.</p>

<h3 id="e200">Guangzhou's Summer Resorts <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Fangzong</p>
<p>Guangdong, which has just stabilized, is located in the southernmost part of China, close to the tropics, and the climate is usually very hot. But the hot south does not lack summer resorts. There are four places in the suburbs of Guangzhou. These four places are now bustling and prosperous, and do not change their normal state due to the tense situation. Now I will introduce these four places as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Huangpodong: Huangpodong is very close to Guangzhou, it can be said to be within the scope of the city. People who go there for summer can go early and return late. There are clear streams, shady trees, rugged rocks, and wildflowers everywhere. It is like a peach blossom paradise. Moreover, you can boat and swim in the cool streams. Therefore, young men and women, as well as small clerks from agencies and banks, love to go there to enjoy themselves to the fullest for a day, and because the journey is relatively short, the cost is extremely low.</p>
<p>(2) Conghua Hot Springs: Conghua Hot Springs, since the prominent figures of the party-state have been intent on operating it, are famous in Baiyue. And Mr. Hu Zhantang went there repeatedly to recuperate and discuss the current situation before his death, which made it even more famous throughout the country. From Guangzhou to Conghua, take the Conghua Highway bus, which only takes one hour. There are green mountains and clear waters, and the construction is very modern. The flying springs and waterfalls hanging high are even more magnificent. Villas of important people are everywhere, and selling snacks, raw fruits, soda, and paper is available everywhere. This is a paradise for important people and civil servants to play.</p>
<p>(3) Qingyuan Gorge: Qingyuan Gorge is farther away from Guangzhou, so people who go there must stay for a few days, or spend the entire summer there. And the scenery there is quiet, majestic, and like a fairyland. Taking a ship from the mouth of the Beijiang River, the mountains on both sides are verdant and the green shade covers the sky. It is a cool world, and waterfalls and flying springs are everywhere. The strange rocks are rugged and extremely dangerous, which is unmatched elsewhere. And there are also famous scenic spots such as Feixia Cave, Taihe Cave, Convent, and Xiashan Ancient Temple. Since the beginning of summer, it has become the world of wealthy merchants, tycoons, young masters and young ladies.</p>
<p>(4) Luofu Mountain: Boluo Luofu Mountain, also because of Mr. Hu Zhantang's repeated visits, is as well-known as West Lake in Hangzhou. There is a bus from Guangzhou to Luofu, so transportation is very convenient. The scenery of Luofu is very majestic, with more than 500 peaks on the entire mountain, of which the Elder Peak and Jade Maiden Peak are the most famous. The ancient Daron has Chongxu Temple, Baihedong Temple, Huanglong Temple and other Taoist temples. You cannot browse all over it without playing there for a month or two. This year, construction is advancing rapidly, with parks and hydroelectric power plants, so foreign summer vacationers take Luofu as their destination.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Moonlight Night in the South <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— (Huang Kewei)</p>
<p>The moonlit night in the South is like a beautiful prose poem, a peach-colored musical score; its melody contains gentle tones, and its scenery is full of quiet flavor, enough to make people love and be intoxicated!</p>
<p>The dark green shallow edges, the flowing water floats curvingly over the broad leaves, like a few strands of silver snakes; the water ferry hits the smooth green stones, and pops out a uniform tone, like the soft breathing of a girl. The wind blowing from the beach is salty, shaking the long whiskers of the palm trees, and from time to time there are a few water birds that break through the bright silver waves and fly towards the bright moon, leaving a loud cry in the bright blue night sky.</p>
<p>Lying quietly under the coconut grove, whistling softly, the moon is hanging diagonally on the treetop, and the light like water leaks through the sparse thorns, as if sprinkling a handful of colored glaze pieces, brightly, spreading on the pine needle woven grass, the deep blue sea, in the silver whirlpool, flying fish float happily.</p>
<p>Gently strumming the erhu, singing a song of the loner, longing for the wandering girl who roams on the journey for life: she has a tan healthy skin color, she has dark eyeballs like purple grapes, she has soft hair like sea waves, she has the enthusiasm and vigor of the South in bloom, thinking of many sweet dreams under the banana tree, the scene of snatching black lychees in the lychee forest, the tone slowly becomes sad and trembling!</p>
<p>Happy, the moonlit night in the South!</p>
<p>A group of children in a small boat on the sea flew away, singing the Moonlight Night song of the South and rowing their oars quickly.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Guangzhou's Gambling Dens <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Xia</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Guangdong government's reform, the central government ordered the immediate and strict prohibition of opium and gambling. Opium and gambling have a long history in Guangdong Province, and the province's annual revenue largely depends on the opium and gambling donations and taxes, so Yu Hanmou telegraphed the central government requesting a temporary reprieve. Although the prohibition of opium and gambling in Guangdong has been temporarily postponed, it is only a matter of time. In the near future, there will always be a day when it is completely banned, because the general progressive public in Guangdong have all hated opium and gambling, and in fact, the harm of opium and gambling has indeed been severe!</p>
<p>Guangzhou's gambling dens are institutions specially set up for gamblers, and are also commonly referred to as "Fantan Dens." Before the Northern Expedition, most of these gambling dens were located in the city of Guangzhou, but because they were unsightly, they were all moved to Henan, across the river from Guangzhou. Henan was originally an undeveloped area, but since the gambling dens were completely established in Henan, it has been transformed into a prosperous area. The so-called prosperity means that there are many more restaurants and teahouses, and some special opium dens specially set up for gamblers have also been added. A Zhujiang iron bridge was built the year before last, making transportation between Guangzhou and Henan more convenient, so the business of Henan's gambling dens, restaurants, teahouses, etc. is also more prosperous than before.</p>
<p>Guangzhou's gambling dens have always been contracted by the Defense Expenses Bureau, that is, all the donations and taxes are borne by the Defense Expenses Bureau organized by merchants, and the government does not care about the profits and losses of the gambling dens. After the Defense Expenses Bureau contracted, it was then parceled out to small gambling merchants, but since Chen Jitang came to power, Guangzhou's gambling dens have formed a trust, that is, contracted and operated solely by Huo Zhiting. Huo Zhiting is a big opium and gambling boss in Guangdong. The name of the trust company he uses to control the gambling dens is called "Yutai Company." As long as we arrive in Guangzhou, we can easily see many large signs on the river bank with the words "Yutai Genpai Company." These large characters also emit neon light at night, making the Guangzhou river channel even more beautiful.</p>
<p>Gambling dens are divided into Genpai and Qiantan. Genpai is a large gambling institution, and they accept as much money as the gamblers bet. Qiantan is a place for small gambling, and the gamblers are all coolies and small workers. As long as they have a few copper coins, they can gamble. After Huo Zhiting took over Guangzhou's gambling dens, he set up countless gambling dens, distributed in the streets and alleys of Henan. These gambling dens all have the same name, which is "Yutai Company."</p>
<p>"Fantan" is a unique gambling form in Guangdong, very similar to "Yabao" in the north. But "Fantan" has as many as four doors, namely one, two, three, and four. The person opening the gambling uses dice made of porcelain or copper (also old copper coins). The "Sha Tan" (the person opening the gambling) grabs a handful of dice and covers it under a specially made cup, and the gamblers can bet at will. If the number you bet on is "one," and the dice that is opened is also "one," then you have won. If you bet on "one" alone, this is called "Gu Fan," and one dollar can be paid three dollars, but after deducting a 10% discount, you can get three dollars and seventy cents including the principal. If you bet on "Jiao," that is, bet on two numbers at the same time, then it is only one dollar for one dollar, and you have to give a 10% discount. In addition, there are so-called "Lian," "Sanmen," etc. betting methods, which can be said to be numerous.</p>
<p>The people who work in the gambling den, in addition to the "Sha Tan," there is also the "Yintai" who keeps the money, which is equivalent to the accounting room; and there is also the "Da He," who is specially responsible for collecting money and paying money. This kind of person must be very smart in teaching before he can be competent; and there is also the "Diao Luo," who is specially responsible for using a basket to hang the gambling money of the noble gamblers upstairs to the gambling table below.</p>
<p>Those who can run upstairs to gamble must be big gamblers. They often bet tens of dollars, hundreds of dollars, or even thousands of dollars. The gambling den treats these people with special courtesy. As soon as they step on the second floor, the tea boy will send tea, send cigarettes, send melon seeds, send green fruits, and sometimes send snacks. In short, they try their best to please the gamblers, so that even if they lose money gambling, they feel that they have had a moment of happy life.</p>
<p>Because the gambling den can give a 10% discount, it always wins money. Huo Zhiting can accumulate tens of millions of wealth, all relying on gambling dens to earn it. However, the gambling den's treatment of its staff is not very harsh. Usually, each staff member only works twice a day, four hours each time. The "Sha Tan" can get a salary of one dollar and fifty cents a day, and the "Diao Luo" and "Changtai" are all one dollar and fifty cents. The "Da He" is divided into head and second hand, the head is one dollar and eighty cents, and the second hand is one dollar and fifty cents. But Daozhong's salary is not fixed, it depends on the position of this gambling den. If this gambling den is second-class, the salary will be even lower. This is talking about Genpai, as for those who work on Qiantan, the salary is much lower!</p>

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Five: Jinxi's Words Repeatedly Paint Emerald Leaves; The Wedding Dress Shakes, Tears Stain the Gauze</p>
<p>Because his letter had a more sincere expression, the uneasy attitude when he had not seen a reply can be imagined. Now, going to meet him face to face, seeing that there was no anger on my face, he would think that I had accepted his sincere expression. Under this kind of considerate mood, he became more and more of a like-minded friend to Guoqi. But all the way to the entrance of my school, I didn't see Guoqi's trace. At that time, I was thinking that it was common for us to miss each other due to differences in time, so I would wait for the next time. On this day, as usual, when I was unhappy, I was unwilling to go home for lunch. But today, in order to get a chance to see him, I still came home to eat. Unexpectedly, the more he wanted to meet Guoqi, the less he could meet him. I went home in the evening. Looking at the faces of the people at home, it seemed that there was a secret hidden inside. He also put on a straight face, not looking anyone in the eye, and went upstairs with his schoolbag. When he passed the entrance of the main room where his mother lived, Mrs. Jiang saw him. From afar, she called out, "Menglan, you're back late. Do you have a lot of homework today?" He stopped and answered softly. Mrs. Jiang said, "Come here, I've saved you a little something you like to eat." When he spoke, he was smiling slightly, and he just kept nodding. From this, it can be seen how he wanted to express his mother-son love. Menglan couldn't bear to refuse his mother's call, so he still carried his schoolbag and went to his mother's room. Mrs. Jiang opened his wardrobe, took out a porcelain jar, put it on the table, and smiled at Menglan, "Child, guess what's in here?" Menglan shook his head and didn't answer what it was. Mrs. Jiang glanced at him. Although she had already seen that he was very unhappy, she didn't want to say anything. She opened the porcelain jar lid and smiled, "This is pine nut candy brought from Suzhou. Don't you like to eat it?" Saying that, she grabbed a handful and gave it to him. He took it with his hands and bowed awkwardly, thanking his mother. It was an unprecedented behavior. Without waiting for his mother to speak again, he turned around and went upstairs. When he got to the room, he first threw the pine nut candy on the table, then threw the schoolbag on the bed, and then leaned against the table, sitting sideways, only raising one hand to support his head. He sat there blankly until dinner before going downstairs. When eating at the table, his sister-in-law also became polite, and sent a bowl of rice that he loved to eat to him. He couldn't help laughing, "Why are you all being polite to me? Have I suddenly become a guest?" The sister-in-law smiled, "Although you are not a guest..." With just this sentence, Mrs. Jiang had already given him two glances in a row. Because of this, everyone was silent and didn't bring up...</p>

<h3 id="e204">A Crisp Haircut <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Yiqing</p>
<p>Cutting hair short and being done with it, without combing, brushing, curling, or anything else.</p>
<p>When Chinese people get a haircut, they often give the barber extra tips because the barber handles it meticulously, in addition to the stipulated price. This is clearly encouraging the barber to be more and more meticulous, and the more "complicated," the better. In fact, in the absence of awareness and disinfection of equipment, the more meticulous the barber is, the more likely it is to attract bacteria, and the more "complicated" it is, the more it seems to be particularly "complicated" with bacteria.</p>
<p>When foreigners get a haircut in our country, they only need the barber to use the clippers and scissors to cut the hair short, without dusting, combing, or absolutely washing the face or shaving, and even more absolutely without ear-picking, eye-touching, or nose-scraping. After the haircut, they always take their short hair, take a bath and wash it once. After the bath, they comb their hair with a sparse comb or bristle brush, and that's it. Shaving is always done with their own safety razor. Look at how crisp this kind of haircut is! Are the skills of our country's barbers not that simple? Don't they know that? Why don't they dare to teach it?</p>
<p>The reason for this is very common. Eyes, ears, and nose are such precious and delicate organs, how can they be touched, dug, or scraped, and casually handled by barbers! They have never heard of it in their own country. If they are injured by digging or touching, then "a broken ship has many passengers," which is tantamount to opening the door to all kinds of infections, and even more so in their calculations. Also, who would believe that the face cloths, basins, razors, and strops placed in barbershops that don't know what disinfection is are not infected with bacteria? In their own country, if they suffer from a certain barber's neglect and contract some disease, they can immediately report the barber's neglect of duty to the local health authorities. If the government investigates and confirms it, it can immediately revoke his business license. If they contract some infection or get some disease from a haircut in our country, who can they tell?</p>
<p>(Note: Scraping the nose is extremely easy to scratch the nasal mucosa, causing colds, pyogenic bacteria, erysipelas, leprosy, syphilis, otitis media—caused by colds, meningitis—caused by otitis media (rare). The external auditory canal is dug, and if it is slightly injured, it is very easy to get boils, chronic dermatitis, otitis externa, contact impetigo, cellulitis. Earwax also increases with digging; puncturing the eardrum with pyogenic bacteria is also easy to infect the middle ear. Touching the eyes is extremely easy to contract trachoma, pinkeye—acute mucous membrane inflammatory conjunctivitis, gonococcal ophthalmia, etc. When shaving and washing the face, it is easy to get contact impetigo, erysipelas, syphilis (the latter two are rarer) from the razor, and trachoma, pinkeye, gonococcal ophthalmia from the face cloth (rarer; gonococci die as soon as the towel dries). Combing not only easily stimulates seborrheic dermatitis and dandruff, but if a piece of skin is removed, it is also easy to contract scalp purulent inflammation and erysipelas; in children, it is especially easy to contract ringworm, favus—scabies, head lice, and contact impetigo. Using a brush, new wool brushes are prone to anthrax, and dirty brushes are prone to scabies.)</p>
<p>Although, judging from the situation in our country, involving the eyes, ears, and nose during haircuts is troublesome and useless. We can absolutely eliminate this bad habit and not allow barbers to mess around. As for shaving, because not everyone in the country can equip themselves with a safety razor, they still have to rely on barbers to do it. Wooden combs are sometimes still necessary. Therefore, the compromise is to use them as much as possible. On the one hand, we should refer to the business regulations followed by foreign barbershops and the disinfection methods used for clippers and scissors—one barber should have three or four sets of razors and scissors. After use, they should be placed in a formalin sterilizer for two hours, or often immersed in Lysol solution for disinfection and standby use (in fact, the latter method rusts easily, so barbers are not very willing to use it)—, In schools or other freely managed communities, find ways to disinfect at any time—for razors, clippers, and scissors to be used, a bottle of alcohol can be prepared to teach the barber to immerse them in it frequently: face cloths are best prepared by each person, or still shared, but estimate the number of people who get haircuts every day, and prepare a few more, and teach the barber to stipulate that each person uses a clean face cloth, and at night, it must be placed in a steamer or a specially made simple steamer for a quarter of an hour for use the next day; wooden combs should also be disinfected by boiling, and horny combs should be wiped with alcohol every time they are used. If you go to a barber shop in the city alone, it is best to bring some alcohol or high-quality white liquor (shochu), and wipe the razors and scissors before the barber uses them. It is best to bring your own face cloth, or first teach him to wash it with boiling water, or, like foreigners, just be a "pedantic gentleman," only cut your hair, don't shave your face, and don't bother him with all the "add oil and add sauce" and "dragging mud and water" tricks.</p>
<p>Also, recently some people have even died directly from perming their hair. There are many precedents in Beijing and Shanghai. For people who are not related, this is also very crisp. The author said that this is just dying crisply; to put it crisply, in places where there are no skilled perming hands, it is better not to perm!</p>
<h3 id="e205">The Mission of Medical Professional Group Representatives to the National Assembly <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Naili</p>
<p>Political tutelage is nearing its end. Soon, 1,200 national representatives will be elected to form a representative assembly to participate in the National Assembly of the Central Government. These individuals will be the recipients of power from the National Government after the completion of political tutelage, hence they are national representatives. Therefore, how significant are the responsibilities of these 1,200 national representatives!</p>
<p>According to Article 2, Clause 2 of the National Assembly Representative Election Law, 380 representatives will be elected by professional groups. Furthermore, according to the quota list for representatives from free professional groups, medical and pharmaceutical professional groups have a quota of eight representatives. The current election regulations inappropriately group physicians and pharmacists as a single free profession. As a result, the actual number of representatives from physicians in the National Assembly will not exceed eight. When the election is announced, the representatives elected by this free professional group will account for slightly more than six per thousand of the total number of representatives. Nevertheless, the mission of this small number of representatives elected by the physician professional group is extremely significant, differing from the representatives elected by other regional and professional elections. Please allow me to elaborate.</p>
<p>Our country has been labeled the "sick man of Asia." The people generally lack a firm understanding of medical and health matters. Some stubbornly cling to their specious views, while others consider hygiene insignificant, entrusting everything to fate. This ingrained habit is weakening the nation. Furthermore, the number of people addicted to tobacco and alcohol is increasing daily. The lack of attention to the health of women and children has led to an alarmingly high excess mortality rate. The average life expectancy is declining steadily. This is not only a tangible decrease in population but also a weakening of the people's physical constitution. Moreover, this has indirect or direct losses to society and the economy. The only entity that suffers the greatest loss from this situation is the nation. This past spring, the National Physician Association, during its Fourth Representative Conference in Hankou, passed a resolution requesting the Central Government to vigorously implement national eugenics, precisely in light of this situation. This is the primary concern for the representatives elected by the physician free professional group in the National Assembly.</p>
<p>Regarding medical defense, in peacetime, the suitability of medicine and pharmaceuticals is entrusted to the entire nation's people. Various public health measures, whether implemented or not, such as epidemic prevention, tuberculosis prevention, leprosy prevention, and even attention to dental health, all have direct or indirect relationships with the nation and its people. Therefore, the determination of medical and health policy objectives and their implementation cannot be said to be unrelated to national defense. In wartime, the relationship between medical defense becomes even more crucial. Frontline treatment, rear area care, epidemic reduction during wartime, and relief for the sick and injured all require meticulous planning. The determination and implementation of these standards and plans require professional insight and immense dedication to service to be effective.</p>
<p>Regarding health education, it is a crucial task at present. We know that the power of education is profound. The weakness of the nation in the past was partly due to the neglect of health education. Therefore, the representatives elected by the physician free professional group in the National Assembly must clearly recognize the importance of health education and resolutely exercise their powers to determine its course.</p>
<p>The countryside is withering, and poverty and disease are increasing daily. The number of those who are bedridden and unable to afford medical care is countless. Even the middle class struggles with the burden of medical expenses. This directly inflicts health and even life misfortunes on individuals, while the nation and society suffer order and economic losses. Therefore, establishing the principle of medical relief is an important issue at present, and the creation of health insurance regulations is indispensable and cannot be delayed. Its implementation and content must benefit the people in every way, which is self-evident. This also deserves attention.</p>
<p>In recent years, during my service with the National Physician Association, the number of medical litigation cases I have seen and heard, whether consulted by the authorities or reported by colleagues, is countless. The Physician Law has not been enacted, and physicians lack protection. Therefore, the Physician Association has drafted a Physician Association Law based on the resolutions of the Fourth Representative Conference this spring, to contribute to the authorities. This is for the benefit of colleagues themselves, and I especially hope that the representatives will promote the early enactment of the Physician Association Law, so that the protection of the medical profession can be solidified soon, which is no small matter concerning the future of medical affairs.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Overview of the Zhenjiang Rural Summer Health Patrol Propaganda Team (Part 2) <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Zhangzao</p>
<p>We conduct injections, lectures, and investigations during the day, and costume performances at night. This not only does not interfere with the work of the rural farmers but also helps restore their fatigue from a day's labor. As for the number of people injected in various places, it varies depending on the level of health education in each location. However, the villagers are deeply aware of the harm of prevalent epidemics, and there have been no difficulties in administering vaccinations. During our theatrical performances, the audience is always interested. On average, the number of people injected in each location is more than 500, totaling more than 4,000 people. The number of spectators at each location is also more than 1,000. We have proven from various aspects that farmers need the benefits of health facilities and the urgency of scientific medical care. If someone comes to promote and establish rural health undertakings, the villagers are willing to agree and assist in the process.</p>
<p>(D) Conclusion</p>
<p>The importance of the countryside in China can be found at any time and any place: in terms of population, farmers account for more than 80% of the national population; in terms of land, agricultural land accounts for the majority; in terms of export goods, agricultural products account for the largest number; other aspects, such as national income and raw materials for domestic industries, are also mostly derived from rural areas. Therefore, the countryside has become the foundation of the national economy. If we want the country to be rich and strong, we should first make the foundation of the country (the countryside) sound.</p>
<p>However, the misfortune of the Chinese countryside, since the September 18th Incident, the countryside has suffered from natural and man-made disasters, and it has often been in a difficult situation of bankruptcy. As soon as we arrive in the countryside, we hear cries for help. On the other hand, the calls for rural revitalization in various places are very high, and their rescue methods are multifaceted: economy, society, politics, education, agricultural improvement, etc. But perhaps no one has thought about the issue of rural medical and health.</p>
<p>To trace the root and seek the source: anyone who wants a sound career must have a sound body. Because Chinese farmers do not know the essentials of hygiene, and they usually lose the way of health preservation, so trachoma, scabies, favus, tuberculosis and other diseases in the countryside are constantly invading the farmers. Especially when epidemics are prevalent, it is even more terrible, and at least four kinds of bad phenomena occur:</p>
<p>(1) Villagers get sick, and because praying to gods and worshiping Buddha is ineffective, they spend money.</p>
<p>(2) Villagers are prone to mistakes because they do not seek medical treatment</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>People.</p>
<p>(3) Villagers are prone to expanding areas due to lack of prevention methods, resulting in increased mortality and decreased population.</p>
<p>(4) Villagers cannot cultivate the land because of illness, resulting in reduced productivity.</p>
<p>In summary, our classmates all believe that we are citizens of China, and in this extraordinary period, we should contribute what we have learned to society. Therefore, this summer vacation, we would rather sacrifice the comfort of the individual to plan for the happiness of the greater us. In addition to patrolling and publicizing for twelve days before and after to promote people's attention to summer health; and each person purchased scientific medical equipment and instruments and went to various central townships to organize village clinics to relieve the suffering of the villagers' diseases. At the same time, we also have to ask the national medical community not to care about selfishness and self-interest any more, go to the countryside to universally protect the lives of farmers; consolidate the economic foundation of the country, so as to prepare for a decisive battle for survival with the imperialism that is invading our country. Therefore, we say: the universalization of rural health and the strengthening of the physique of farmers are also a policy to solve the national crisis.</p>

<p>— Lin Jianxian</p>
<p>(Question 221) Why should mouthwash be used frequently after a tooth extraction?</p>
<p>Answer: Wounds on the skin in various parts of the body can be tightly covered with sterilized gauze to prevent the invasion of microorganisms. However, tooth extraction wounds are open and cannot be completely isolated from the many microorganisms in the mouth. Therefore, mouthwash must be used to reduce the number and activity of microorganisms in the mouth to reduce the chance of the wound being invaded. In the three days after the tooth extraction, it should be rinsed once every hour, and each rinse should last for more than one minute. Teeth with pus should be rinsed diligently.</p>
<p>(Question 222) What else should patients pay attention to after a tooth extraction?</p>
<p>Answer: Do not forcefully suck the wound or lick the wound with your tongue to avoid bleeding. Do not overexert yourself, and keep your mood calm. Stimulants such as tobacco and alcohol should be temporarily prohibited. Choose soft foods, and chew with the teeth on the other side when eating. If the wound is stuffed with gauze, if you do not go to the doctor for examination, do not let it stay there for four or five days to avoid accumulating dirt and hindering the growth of the gums.</p>
<p>(Question 223) When will the gums heal inside after a tooth extraction?</p>
<p>Answer: It takes about two to four weeks, depending on the individual's physical strength, age, etc.</p>
<p>(Question 224) What are the dangers of pulling teeth by people who hold umbrellas on the street or make dentures?</p>
<p>Answer: They have no knowledge of the principles and procedures of anesthesia and disinfection, and they know nothing about the anatomy and histology of the dental part, so there are absurd claims that a certain tooth is a blood tooth, and a certain tooth is connected to the brain. Their pliers, injection needles, etc. have not been properly disinfected, and the tooth extraction wound is infected by them, resulting in various dangerous inflammations, some of which are incurable, and some of the broken tooth roots are left in place, causing the patient to suffer from swelling and pain. To avoid this dangerous behavior, on the one hand, it depends on the authorities to take strong action, and on the other hand, everyone must have a real understanding and not try it out just because of the guarantee of neighbors and friends.</p>

<p>(95) The Necessity of Hearing Examination for School Children</p>
<p>Hygiene is a broad field, generally divided into personal hygiene, public hygiene, school hygiene, and factory hygiene. Personal hygiene focuses on an individual's clothing, food, shelter, and daily life, which individuals themselves should adhere to. Public hygiene seeks the happiness of the public and is promoted by the government. School hygiene aims to cultivate young people with strong physiques and is improved by school authorities. Factory hygiene ensures the safety of workers' lives and is designed by the factory. Among school hygiene, physical examination is the most important. For children, special attention should be paid to their hearing examination. Observing the results of numerous statistics, we know that one-quarter of school children lack normal hearing for speech. The presence or absence of hearing impairment has a significant impact on intellectual development. This is because the ear is the primary gateway for input in children's education. Normal hearing is defined as being able to hear whispered speech (low-volume speech) from a distance of 25 meters or more. If whispered speech can only be heard within 8 meters, it can be felt that input for complete education is difficult. School teachers often misunderstand children's hearing difficulties, attributing them to children's laziness, stupidity, or negligence, not knowing that they are the result of hearing difficulties. From a doctor's point of view, school children with hearing difficulties suffer two kinds of losses: (1) they cannot receive education at the same time and in the same way as other children; (2) they often have suppurative otitis media, which may at any time cause labyrinthine diseases or intracranial complications, and some may even be fatal. In the case of chronic suppurative otitis media, the foul smell from the ear discharge often makes the air in the classroom unclean and easily mediates various infectious diseases (such as influenza, tuberculosis, etc.). If we want to prevent the occurrence of such unfortunate events, it is certainly not difficult. The only way is to entrust a specialist to conduct hearing examinations to find them early and carry out appropriate treatment. However, in fact, it is often not easy to do. Because there are often problems with time, cost, and family. So for convenience, it is best for the school doctor to pay special attention to the examination during the physical examination. At the same time, it is also appropriate to refer to the teacher's report on academic performance, because the quality of performance is often closely related to hearing (as mentioned in detail above). Examiners must not neglect this. Speaking of the policy of hearing examination, it can be divided into five:</p>
<p>(1) The hearing of the left and right ears must be examined separately. One side of the external auditory canal can be blocked with the index finger on the same side. Therefore, the ear side with hearing loss can be accurately diagnosed.</p>
<p>(2) The child being examined must not face the examiner, because they can often imagine the unheard speech according to the examiner's lip movements.</p>
<p>(3) The language used during the examination should also be selected. General specialists often use numbers to examine, which is more likely to obtain accurate examination results. The types of numbers are best one, seven, thirty-seven, forty-seven, seventy-seven, etc. In addition, names such as car, rickshaw, tram, train, tap water, milk, coffee, and Yong'an Company can also be used for examination.</p>
<p>(4) The hearing distance obtained from whispered speech must be recorded separately for each language, so that specialists can estimate the type of disease in the future.</p>
<p>(5) The strength of whispered speech must always be the same, otherwise the results obtained may vary. After the five examinations according to the above, if there are children with</p>
<p>If there is hearing loss, the parents of the child should be notified immediately, explaining the relationship with schoolwork and the necessity of treatment. As for the treatment policy, it is determined by a specialist. In general, more than half of the results of treating hearing loss in school children can be completely restored. But what should be done with children whose recovery is incomplete or whose treatment is ineffective? If we want to solve this problem, we can use a suggestion from the famous German professor Hartmann. His suggestion is divided into three types:</p>
<p>(1) High hearing loss The whispered speech hearing distance with relatively good hearing is less than half a meter.</p>
<p>(2) Moderate hearing loss The whispered speech hearing distance with relatively good hearing is half to three meters?</p>
<p>(3) Mild hearing loss The whispered speech hearing distance with relatively good hearing is three to eight meters.</p>
<p>For children with mild or moderate hearing loss, the seat should be near the podium, especially a seat that is easy to face the classmates. Because in the teacher-student question and answer, the lip movements of the classmates can be used to supplement his insufficient hearing. For children with high hearing loss, the ear with relatively good hearing should face the lecture. As for children with the highest degree of hearing loss, a separate class should be set up, called the hearing loss class, and a special teaching method should be adopted.</p>

<p>8.  Scopolia japonica, Maxim.</p>
<p>(Plant) It grows naturally in dark and shady places, a perennial herb. The rhizome is nodular, the stem is up to 30-50 cm high, and the branches are sparse. The leaves are soft, alternate, petiolate, oblong-elliptic, and the apex is acute. In spring, bell-shaped flowers with purple and yellow colors bloom. The capsule is spherical.</p>
<p>Scopolia was originally Hyosoyamus niger, L. produced in our country. I don’t know when it was mistakenly filled with the name of this plant, but due to many years of habit, correcting it would cause misunderstanding, so it remains.</p>
<p>(Cultivation method) Scopolia has always been collected from wild products to fill medicinal streams, but it can also be cultivated. Prepare the land in mid-November, with a ridge width of two feet. First apply compost to the nursery land, and then plant its rhizomes, with a spacing of one foot between each plant. In early spring, apply more fertilizer. In November, dig out its roots, which is the harvesting period, and leave a part as seed roots for replanting. The harvested rhizomes must have their fibrous roots removed, the soil washed away, and dried in the sun.</p>
<p>(Crude drug) Scopolia root Rhizoma Scopoliae, is collected from its dried rhizomes. This product is nodular, irregularly curved, 15 cm long, and 3 cm thick. The surface is wrinkled and grayish-brown. The upper part of the nodules has concave stem marks, the back is short and large, and the roots are branched, leaving traces of its roots. The cross-section is granular and off-white. This product has no odor and a bitter taste.</p>
<p>(Ingredients) The rhizome contains Allealoid. Alkaloid, which is Hyosoyamin C17H23N03, Atroipin (d-l-Hyoscyamiu), Nor-hyoscyamin Cr6H2rO2N, Noratropin, Scopofamin C17H21NO4, etc. According to the analysis of Mr. Yanagisawa in Japan, its content rate is as follows. Total Alkaloid 0.213%, Hyosoyamin 0.108%%Atropin 0.046%, Noratropin 0.037%, Scopolamn 0.004%.</p>
<p>It also contains Scopolin Cr6 Hr8O9 glycoside. Scopolin hydrolyzes with water to produce glucose and Scopoletin (B-Methylaesculitin) CroH8O4.</p>
<p>The stems and leaves also contain Hyosoyamin, Atropin, Scopolamin, Scopolin, etc.</p>
<p>(Medicinal uses) Scopolia root is used exclusively for Scopolia liquid, or as a raw material for the manufacture of atropine sulfate. Scopolia infusion is a spasmolytic and analgesic drug for treating asthma, neuralgia, stomach pain, etc. for internal use. - - Re-use amount 0.01 cm, and Scopolia infusion can be made into plasters, ointments, suppositories, etc. to treat neuralgia, hemorrhoids, etc. for external use.</p>

<p>— Me</p>
<p>According to recent news, since Badajoz was captured in the Spanish turmoil, the rebel army has grown stronger. Mula issued a fierce speech, refusing any peace talks. The only government army in Morocco also announced its allegiance to the rebels. Seeing the situation of this war report, the current government of Spain is not reliable. The revolutionary army has a tendency to replace it, and its situation is obvious. The helpers behind the government army are Britain and France, and the helpers behind the revolutionary army are Germany and Italy, so in name it is Spain's internal turmoil, but in reality it is a drama of democracy and fascism fighting there.</p>
<p>Now that Britain and France see that the situation is not good, if the two sides evolve, they may become a second European war, so they have repeatedly stated that they will not participate in Spain's turmoil and will not provide any military aid to any army. After all, this kind of statement has very little impact. So Britain and France agreed and concluded an agreement to prohibit the transport of arms to Spain. The two countries have exchanged notes in Paris, and it is said that if Italy and Germany do not express opposition, it will take effect. I am in this kind of agreement, which can reduce the risk of a world war, but it is absolutely impossible to prevent Italy and Germany from helping behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Although democracy was once popular, it is now outdated and few believe in it, while fascism is now "selling well" and is very modern. Therefore, the situation that democracy cannot defeat fascism is already obvious. According to a report from Mary on the 14th, the cities occupied by the rebel army are scheduled to hang red and yellow flags tomorrow to celebrate their victory. According to the red and yellow colors, which represent red blood and gold, were designated by the rebel authorities as the official flag. This kind of flag is really bright.</p>
<p>The national flag of a country originally represents the national will of the country. What kind of doctrine does the country use, and what shape and color of flag can be seen at a glance. The national flag of the Spanish rebel army uses red and yellow colors, which really reflects the spirit of the revolutionary army. What else does the current country have besides iron blood and money? If you want money, you must kill people. If you can't kill people, you will never get money. Therefore, the more people you kill, the more money you get, so there is a common saying of "blood rice", and money is also called blood. Calling people rich means they have a lot of blood, and calling people poor means they have little blood. The meaning is the same.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you want to fight for money in one place, you must make the people in one place bleed. If you want to fight for money in the world, you must make the people of the world bleed. If you don't bleed, you won't stop. Now people's intelligence, people's cruelty, and people's understanding are nothing more than this.</p>

<p>—— Miscellaneous Mountain Travel Notes</p>
<p>Spending the entire day in a teahouse.</p>
<p>This mountain town's teahouse is not worth lingering in, whether in terms of facilities or hospitality. However, we couldn't care less about these things. We sat on long wooden benches, brewed a large pot of clear tea, calmed our minds, and listened to people from different social strata speaking in different ways, allowing the entire mountain town to be reflected in their words.</p>
<p>"The waters of Xishan Gulch burst forth, and the Mentou Dam market has been missed twice!" The speaker was a small merchant-looking man with a worried and bitter face, sitting at a nearby table: "Old Second, think about it, the losses from those two times aren't small, eh!"</p>
<p>I was already quite concerned about the conditions of the road, and this further piqued my interest. I thought to myself: "The flash flood is probably the reason why the car stopped?" Looking at the others, they remained silent and indifferent.</p>
<p>Later, after much inquiry, I learned that a section of the road at Luoshi Weir was submerged by the flood. The surrounding farmlands had all become pools of water.</p>
<p>On the fourth day, we finally got back on the road. When we reached Luoshi Weir, although the major part of the water had receded, there was still nearly two feet of water remaining. The driver smiled—</p>
<p>"It's nothing. We just need to dash through this bit of water." He gestured, his eyes estimating the dimensions of the road surface, "Unlike the previous two days, that was really impossible. The water could have suppressed the cylinder, causing you to lose control."</p>
<p>After crossing that not-so-wide river, we stopped at a station by the riverbank in the evening. At this point, should we continue or stop here? Everyone was discussing. Due to a message brought by the company, we ended up leaving in the hazy moonlight.</p>
<p>Just as we were about to fall asleep, "Squeak," the car came to a sudden, violent stop. The sudden impact awakened us. The driver hurriedly jumped out to repair the damaged parts, asking us to shine our flashlights on his pale face, with sweat beads as large as beans. We couldn't see a single light anywhere, only the chirping of wild insects.</p>
<p>"Damn it, it all broke down in this place!" he complained, borrowing Ah Huang's flashlight and rushing across the field, shining the light into the bushes.</p>
<p>"Oh no! Oh no!" he shouted as he returned, "This place is called Black Tooth Ridge. Packs of wolves often appear here. Going forward six or seven more miles, like the Nine Turns you passed, is also a dangerous place."</p>
<p>We were stunned, unsure of how to deal with the immediate danger.</p>
<p>Holding our breath, we watched him wipe each of the wires, adding some oil to the screws. The clock hands moved from nine-thirty to ten-thirty. Finally, miraculously, he finished repairing the damaged parts.</p>
<p>"Howl, howl," the rough sounds like a whirlwind swept across the field. Six or seven tall wolves surrounded us, trying to jump into the carriage through the windows. We quickly used iron rulers to fight them off, preventing them from getting in. The driver also skillfully operated the engine, turned on the headlights, and sped away!</p>
<p>One of the larger wolves was still closely following, refusing to let go, and even jumped onto the rear bumper.</p>
<p>"Okay, watch this!" Ah Huang said, pulling out the holster. He smirked, "Boom," a flash of fire, a puff of smoke, and with that sound, it fell off the bumper.</p>
<p>The driver said: "The families living nearby, due to carelessness with their doors, often have their babies snatched into the wolves' mouths."</p>
<p>"Should we be grateful for the blessings of fate?" We broke free from the dangerous encirclement.</p>
<h3 id="e213">A Common Tragedy <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Ting</p>
<p>Here, where we live, is a narrow and dirty alley. Running from the beginning to the end of the alley is only twenty or thirty steps. Two small rows of houses face each other, packed tightly together, old and dilapidated.</p>
<p>There's a sand-casting workshop right across from us. Inside, a few small, dark lads spend all day in that dim and filthy workshop, busily working while laughing and yelling in a sharp and strange tone...</p>
<p>This laughter and yelling, in the dead of night, sometimes annoys us so much. However, after a certain period of time, they naturally fade away and are replaced by another sound.</p>
<p>We stand silently, using slow eyes to gaze at the greyish window across the way. That sad, low crying and sobbing often makes us feel heartache inside. "Does this sound like a cry from hell? No! It's too weak and pitiful!..." Thinking this, we all become despondent, tears welling up in our eyelids.</p>
<p>Gradually, in that sand-casting workshop, a tall, thin middle-aged man catches our attention. He leaves every morning, without fail, almost certainly, and doesn't return until late at night. Then, the whimpering and cursing sounds are thrown from the dark window frames, passing through the air pressure, reaching our side.</p>
<p>Clearly, the sobs and curses are emitted from two different mouths, but other than this tall, middle-aged man, we see nothing else. A young lad in the sand-casting workshop, when we get to know each other one day, wipes his greasy little mouth smeared with black soot and says:</p>
<p>"It's been three months. Both of them were laid off from the silk mill, and they argue all day long..."</p>
<p>"Who is the man with?" I ask attentively.</p>
<p>"His woman, who has lung disease..." he answers bluntly.</p>
<p>Then, he innocently, using his bare, greasy little arm, tells me, sketching her figure and outline. Gradually, in front of my eyes, the shadow of a short, sickly, pale-faced young woman with sunken cheeks and yellowish eyes flickers in my mind. Slowly, she becomes clearer and more vivid. Finally, her two dark lips are gently trembling, and then she utters in a mysterious tone, worriedly saying:</p>
<p>"What can be done, the machines in the silk reeling room have devoured my lungs!..."</p>
<p>Her yellowish eyes slowly well up with a few tears, and then quietly disappear!</p>
<p>One rainy evening, I am pacing uneasily in the house. A heavy thud attracts me. I hold my breath and listen. I hear a low whimpering sound.</p>
<p>"I can't live this life anymore..." followed by a nauseating dry cough, coughing so laboriously that it almost makes one suspect that large amounts of blood and sobs are being coughed out. "I'm dragging you down, I'm hurting you, so you should let me go back. We can eat mud and grass roots in our hometown, but here we get nothing..."</p>
<p>The other person sighs heavily and walks away with loud steps.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>This commotion attracts me, shaking me slightly. So, I quicken my pace, push open the door, and run down the stairs, my heart aching.</p>
<p>The alley is quiet, the rain is falling misty. I squint through the dense rain, looking at the sand-casting workshop. The door is ajar, and in a quiet corner, I see a large shadow wriggling, occasionally emitting bitter moans, "It's her, the woman with tuberculosis!" I think quietly.</p>
<p>The next day, the woman with tuberculosis dies in the alley, and the tall middle-aged man is never seen again.</p>

<p>— Li Wen</p>
<p>—— Scattered Notes from Within the Profession</p>
<p>Arriving home, I felt that everything had changed. What I first acutely perceived was that the traces of decline had emerged from every corner, irrepressibly, making every facade seem forced and sustained with effort.</p>
<p>Three years is a brief time for those wandering outside; unknowingly drifting outside for three years, returning home, I realized how long that time truly was!</p>
<p>Father has aged greatly, and the signs of old age have clearly crept into his bones. He has become silent, and the dense wrinkles on his forehead also reveal weariness. What makes me most uncomfortable are his eyes, which contain an unreserved joy and sorrow; he watches me like that, without letting go and without interruption; it's as if he has regained a lost treasure but is also worried about losing it again.</p>
<p>Mother, white hair has begun to relentlessly settle on her head! She had a serious illness last year, and her left eye has become clouded as a result. She still hasn't fully recovered her health; however, all this cannot hinder her excessive joy. She personally busies herself, arranging my bedroom, preparing some exquisite dishes that I liked when I was at home; as if forgetting that my return is only for a short stay, or perhaps hoping that I can be more comfortable during this short period.</p>
<p>——I am a stranger to home now!</p>
<p>I sighed uneasily, deeply feeling that I have become a stranger at home.</p>
<p>——Three years!</p>
<p>I increasingly feel that this is a long, and overly long, time.</p>
<p>I begin to hesitate. I never imagined that in the three years that passed so quickly for me, all the changes would have progressed so severely.</p>
<p>"Yun'er, you should rest too. You've been flying around like dust for so long—now, it's rare to come back…"</p>
<p>Mother's voice grows hoarse as she speaks.</p>
<p>I turn my back, my eyes becoming blurry and misty.</p>
<p>I feel uncomfortable—almost wanting to hug my mother and wail, and loudly tell her that I will stay here from now on…</p>
<p>Father seems to understand me, and with his low, disappointed tone, forces a smile and says:</p>
<p>"However, a man, a real man, can't stay at home forever anyway. I say—I say…but in recent years, the situation in Nanyang (Southeast Asia) has been bad, and the Netherlands government intentionally made the Pajak (Note 1) very high…I see—this place isn't a place to stay for long either. Now that you're back, it's just right. I want to take this opportunity to clear things up and find a chance to quit."</p>
<p>I know it's very difficult for Father to say these words. His face is dark and gloomy, and I see that he's getting older.</p>
<p>"Perhaps you don't understand the situation outside—" Father continues, "We Chinese are practically hanging ourselves here! The situation is so bleak, but the Pajak is drawn so high. Yun'er, it's scary to talk about! For example, in Gangkemon (Note 2), a small Aron (Note 3), imagine, how much is the goods worth? It's just small daily sales, and it's still cents of transactions, but, alas! It's scary, but the Pajak is more than five hundred Guilders! (Note 4) How can small businesses survive this! Many have simply abandoned their shops and run back to China with nothing (Note 5), and there are almost hundreds of them on each ship!</p>
<p>"Our place hasn't been approved yet. If things go wrong at that time, it'll be difficult. We have a lot of dead stock (Note 6), and we can't sell it off for a while, it's really hanging ourselves!</p>
<p>"So I say it's good that you want to go back. We Chinese will eventually return to China. Even dying in our own country is more peaceful!—However, I'm old, and clearing things up won't be smooth right away. I think you should stay at home for a few more days. Firstly, to reassure your mother, who has been worrying about you day and night for three years! Secondly, to help me with my shortcomings. When that time comes, we'll go back together!…"</p>
<p>Father's words are like a whip, lashing at my heart, at every nerve fiber. A strange feeling creeps into my senses, suffocating me with an unusual, oppressive discomfort.</p>
<p>"We…we quit and go back?…" I stammer.</p>
<p>Father sighs heavily. "What else can we do? The situation is so bleak, and the Pajak is so heavy—sigh, sigh, Yun'er, they're anti-Chinese, I've heard many people say it, the Dutch are anti-Chinese!…"</p>
<p>Mother brings over the beef broth she made herself.</p>
<p>"This is your favorite! Isn't it? Eat it, I haven't seen you eat anything for three years!…"</p>
<p>As she speaks, Mother's voice grows hoarse again.</p>
<p>Before my eyes, everything seems to be blurring again.—Quit, Pajak, bleak situation, Father is old, Mother is also old, anti-Chinese, anti-Chinese, anti-Chinese…These things are tightly intertwined in my mind, starting slowly and then spinning quickly, I feel dizzy, I hold my head, I fall down—into Mother's arms…</p>

<p>Central and Western (1040) 1:00 PM to 1:45 PM</p>
<p>Opening Chapter of Romance of the Western Chamber "Long Story"</p>
<p>Separation and Reunion, Joy and Sorrow, One Cup of Wine. At the Long Pavilion, a feast is held to see off the Autumn Leader. Only because the Madam forced the test, I had no choice but to make a trip to the capital. Only seeing the shadow of farewell grief in the blue clouds beyond the sky. The ground is covered with chrysanthemums, stirring sad thoughts. Thinking of Liang Hao ascending to the clouds in sweet dew. Sooner or later, it will be difficult to defy fate. I steadily climb the fairy laurel in the Moon Palace. I vow not to return without a name on the golden list. Brother. You must cherish yourself in the windy and frosty inn. Don't rush the long journey by saddle. The horse walks slowly. The carriage follows closely. The shadow of the setting sun urges with a whip. Don't think of the beauty of the imperial capital in spring. Return to your hometown with glory and fine clothes. Good things are always hard to come by. Don't hang your bad fate on your chest. River fish and wild geese should be entrusted. Look forward to the gilded report. There are countless words of concern that can't be said. Can't help it. The chaotic dust blows on my face. The most bitter thing in life is separation. I will separate after sending you a thousand miles. Two hearts will accompany each other in dreams tonight.</p>
