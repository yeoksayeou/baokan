<h3>韃靼尼爾海峽設防問題</h3>
<p>— 朗</p>
<p>洛桑條的簽字國會議已於昨天在瑞士蒙德婁城開幕了這决會議的召集是專門討論土耳其所提出之韃靼尼爾海峽重行設防問題的韃靼尼爾海峽位於歐亞二洲之間前通地中海後經瑪麥拉海而達黑海與博斯波魯斯海峽前後相連不但形成了土耳其的國防重鎮而且也為地中海上的重要側門歐戰後洛桑條的規定韃靼尼爾與博斯波魯斯海峽二岸及瑪麥拉海中若干島嶼為不設防區域各國海艦可自由通過這種親定不僅妨害士耳其的國家安全而且還破壞了土國主權的完整安哥拉政府早想對簽的國提出修改近年來由於各國積極擴充軍備準備第二决世界殖民地的分割戰爭集體安全制度早已遭遇到空前的打擊於是土耳其政府為着本國的安全起見就於四月十一日向各簽的國提出韃靼尼爾海峽一帶重行設防的要求了</p>
<p>土耳其的重行設防要求不但是一個獨立國家的正當舉動而且也適合國際法上「情勢變遷條欵」的原則與國聯盟的第十九條的規定照理是沒有一個國家可加以拒絕的不過這次蒙德婁城會議的前途究竟如何我們還得考察一下各有關國家的態度與海峽設防問題有關的國家共有英法意俄日希臘南斯拉夫羅馬尼亞與保加利亞等國其中最有重要關係的當為英法意俄四國在大戰以前英國向主封鎖韃靼尼爾海峽使俄國黑海艦隊不能出航地中海而威脅英國之海上通路而在戰後英國則一反以前政策中張海峽自由通航因為此時俄國已無强大艦隊足以威脅地中海上的英國覇權而英國却可藉海峽的自由通行遣艦進攻俄國東南境依此觀察英國是應該反對土國的要求的不過近年來國際形勢已經大變現在地中海上英國的重要敵人已不是俄士而是意大利同時英俄的關係也比大戰結束時大形改善所以對於土耳其的海峽設防要求英國自不致反對俄國對土要求也必極力贊成這一方面是因為俄國向來贊助弱小民族的解放運動一方面是因為海峽的設防不啻增强了俄國的第一道國防棧至法希羅南等國近年與土耳其的關係極為密切也必支持土國的要求毫無疑義現在對土國要求最表不滿的恐怕只有意大利一國意國對於亞非二洲向抱有極大的領土野心土耳其海峽的設防當然有碍於意國近東政策的發展所以恐不會邀得意國的贊成不過在此决蒙德婁會議中意國因國際經濟制裁尚未撤消沒有參加而且大部的國家多贊助土國的要求意國的態度諒不至有重大的影響</p>
<p>從各國的態度觀察土國的海峽設防要求大概是可得到圓滿的解决的鞬靼尼爾海峽重行設防的實現不但是弱小民族解放運動的又一勝利而且對於帝國主義的侵略野心也是一個很大的打撃</p>

<h3>中國國富概况與國際關係（三）</h3>
<p>— 張其昀</p>
<p>二十四年度中國沿海進出口船隻總噸數爲一千叫百叫十萬噸，其中英船佔百分之四十二，華船佔百　之二十五，日船佔百分之十五，其决爲美國·瑙威·德國·荷蘭·法國·丹麥·葡萄牙等國。公路近年發達頗速，二十四年統計，全國已有九萬公里可通汽車，內廣東一萬一千餘公里，佔全國第一位，次爲山東·江西·各五千餘公里，共他長二三千公里者佔全國百份半數以上。美國公路長度四千八百萬公里，我國僅及其四百分之一。美國平均每五人有汽車一輛，英國平均四十人，日本七百人，中國須九千人方有汽車一輛。我國所用汽油皆係舶來品，近年進口價値什四千萬以上（汽車汽油各居半數）漏巵之鉅實可驚人。我國民用航空有中國歐亞西南三公司，航空路已有一萬二千餘公里。中國航空公司由中美合辦，歐亞航空公司由中德合辦，但外人只居於技術上地位。最近美國遠東經濟考察團建議全美航空公司，設立橫太平　之航空綫，將來舊金山與中國之行程可統短爲四日。又橫貫歐亞大陸的航空路，從南京經莫斯科至柏林，預計亦僅五日可達。又據日本方面之統計，中日兩國因地理上之接近，政治經濟關係之密切，兼以同文之故，郵便通信最爲殷繁，每年所收發之郵件，共計一千萬封云。</p>
<p>據中央硏究院出版六十五年來中國國際貿易統計于書，中國國際貿易在世界上之地位佔於第十三位，尙不及荷蘭·比利時等國，以人口比例言之，平均每人貿易額尙不及美金三元，與加拿大（美金二百八十元）比較，相差幾及百倍之鉅。我國對外貿易以地域分配，在歐戰以前，華中佔二分之一，華南佔四分之一，華北與華東合計四分之一。自歐戰以後，東北佔三分之一，華中佔三分之一，華北與華南合計三分之一。中國對外貿易常爲入超，而東北則爲出超，東北特產之大豆向爲我國出口貨第一大宗，而足以抵消我國入超之一大部分，目前情勢變遷已不堪回憶。據海關報吿，二十四年度我國對外貿易總額爲十四億丸千萬元，其中進口九億二千萬元，出口五億七千萬元，入超計三億五千萬元。如就貿易價額，作國別之比較，以英日美三國爲最要，其次爲德俄法三國。英本國之地位雖在日美二國之後，但與其殖民地合計，則其第一位置迄未動搖，近年印度棉花坎拿大小麥輸人中國甚多，香港爲一自由港，歐洲貨物由此轉口，地位允爲重要。日本向居對華貿易之第一位（英國僅計其本國），九一八以後國內抵貨運動及東北貿易額消失等關係，已爲美國取而代之。又據美國雷麥敎授（C．F．Remer）之估計，民國二十年列强在華所投資本計三十五億元（美金，東三省在內，）其中英國佔百分之三十七，日本佔百分之三十五，美國佔百分之六，合計幾個五分之四，三國與中國政治經濟之關係，巳可槪見。俄國對外蒙古新疆之貿易，其重要與年俱增，惟不見於海關統計。據實業部國際貿易局最近三十四年來中國通商口岸對外貿易統計，近三十四年來（一九〇〇年至一九三三年）我國四十六通商口岸中，其歷年　口貿易佔全國貿易總額百分之八以上，僅上海漢口天津大連廣州五埠·上海貿易常居全國總額半數以上，二十四年統計，上海佔全國出口總額百分之五十，進口總額百分之五十五。又試以上海與日本神戶相比，二十三年神戶國外貿易額計十五億八千萬元，（佔日本貿易總額百分之三十），同年上海國外易額爲八億叫千萬元，是神戶凌駕上海，而爲東洋第一商　。同年神戶外僑九千餘人，隸屬四十四國，上海外僑六萬三千人（內日僑二萬九千，英俄各一萬）隸屬四十六國，就此點言，上海可稱爲東洋第一國際都會，於此亦見我國對外貿易仍多操於外人之手。</p>
<p>以上所述我國根本實力（人力與物力）巳可知其大要。至於我國國富總額，目前尙無精確數字可指。據日本內閣統計局之調査，日本之國富爲一千一百億元，富力超過日本者爲美國（八千八百億元）與英國（二千九百億元），法俄兩國則與日本相伯仲，其他各國悉在以上諸國之下。國富之推算極爲難事，以上之估計，究竟可靠與吾，殊屬疑問。中國國富尙不詳，欲相比較，更爲困難。惟有一事亦可反映中國之貧弱者，即初等敎育是，民國二十二年日本（本部）小學生的一千七十餘萬人，卽人口每千人有小學生一百六十人，比例率居世界第三位，（次於美國澳洲）我國二十一年統計，今國小學生一千一百七十二萬，（東三省係上年度統計）即人口每千人有小學生二十七人，與日本相差的六倍。兒童失關係民生困苦之結果，此可見人和原不能離地利而孤立，地利亦不能離人和而孤立，生聚與敎訓二者息息相關不能分</p>

<h3>蘇省府與本市銀行界　組織蘇北鹽墾銀團</h3>
<p>最低額六百萬元已在洽商　墾熟後二百萬人可有飯吃</p>
<p>華東社云、江蘇省政府、與棉業編制委員會、曾於本月十日、邀本市銀行界、組織赴蘇鹽墾視察團、茲已返滬、頃悉蘇省府以該項荒地、亟待開發、邀本市各銀行組織鹽墾銀團、聞最低數額為六百萬元、正在洽商中、惟成功期尚遙遠、若能墾為熟地、則二百萬人、可望有飯吃、在上海之百餘萬江北籍民、均可回鄕安居樂業也、茲誌詳情如次、</p>
<p>蘇省請組　鹽墾銀團　江蘇省政府、經邀銀行界赴蘇北參觀後、對於開發可植棉田之　水荒地、進行頗力、在考察期間、已一再與各行代表籌商、省府之意、最少數額為六百萬元、俾便開發、惟銀行界中、以此舉非單純營業性之短期投資可比、雖有允意、惟未作具體表示、</p>
<p>鹽墾區域　甚為安謐　據隨該團同行返滬之金融專家昨吿華東社記者、此行結果、所獲資料甚多、一政治方面、較民國七年現鐵長前中國銀行總經理張公權等赴蘇北時、進步不少、匪盜無踪、地方太平、二技術方面、則十餘年來始終未見進步、人民種植，多沿用舊法、三蘇北鹽地、總計一千五百餘萬畝、現已墾熟者、祗二百餘萬畝、所有主權、都歸墾植公司、致農家春去秋歸、未有安居樂業現象、因此對於田園不願切實耕耘、蓋此乃佃耕農性質、墾熟後亦與彼輩無關也、四各鹽墾公司資本太小、又專注重於商業競爭、無永久計劃、省府亦雜於制止、致請金融界投資或有困難、五人民有耐勞性、地方安謐、前途辦理完善、甚可樂觀、</p>
<p>辦理完善　前途無量　現進已墾鹽地二百萬畝、每畝田地、每年收入約計五元、每年綜計有一千萬元收入、可養活人民三十餘萬人、若將來全部辦理成熟、前途甚為無限、一千五百萬畝棉田、可有五十餘萬戶人家可以藉此活命、一家四口計、則可有二百萬人得藉此營生、每畝田最少年收五元、（多則無限）則總共每年可有七千五百餘萬元、至一萬萬餘元之收入、今日在滬嗷嗷待哺之平民、均有向此不及千里之鹽墾區發展、同時每年生產萬萬元之棉花、又可杜塞同價値之外棉進口、（此項棉、可紡十六支、至二十支之粗紗）於國計民生、均有裨益、端在政府、金融界·人民·三方面合作、則事易舉也云去、</p>
<p>潘仰堯談　先决問題　新新社云、本市銀行界與棉業編制會所組之蘇北鹽墾區參觀團、業於前日返滬、新新社記者往訪參加該團之四行儲蓄會調查股主任潘仰堯君、據談、此次赴蘇北參觀、所有各鹽墾區域、莫不經過、須經墾植之荒地、估計約一千五百萬畝、現已墾熟者僅五分之一、故大多數為未墾之荒地、觀察所得、覺有三大缺點、一過去墾植公司競利太切、二無政治上恊助五缺乏優良技術、因之數年來迄無特殊之進展、故銀行界此次參觀結果、雖知該處為投資農村之優良區域、自南通角斜而迄海州陳家港之新運河開成後、農村發展、更增希望、惟為投資穩固計、於投資之前、須先解决下列之問題、一政治恊助、因蘇北各地、貧瘠萬分、盜匪蜂起、治安上均有待政府之辦理、二交通阻塞、墾區面積遼闊、農產由水陸運輸、均甚不便、三土壤研究、墾區土壤地質不一、須先試騐、俾知何地宜於種植何物四水利研究、墾區港汊、均多淤塞、亦須注重、便利灌溉、至各地農民之耐勞動儉、確為蘇省各縣之冠、然生活之困苦、亦甚於江南各縣、終年辛苦所獲、尚不及溫飽、主要原因、係受商利貸欵之剝削、墾區農民、啟東海門藉居多、惟多不善居積、辛勞所得之代價、頗多消耗烟酒賭博、有錢時不顧平時之苦、此亦與平民敎育有莫大關係也云云、</p>

<p>大公社云、粵省前値事變、廣州市毫洋價格慘跌不已、竟達粵洋千元、合申鈔六四五元之低落現象、嗣經金融界竭力穩定、而軍事行動、亦趨和緩、故毫洋漸見起色逐步回漲、至六百七十元之數、但日來又因時局及港幣關係、使粵匯再度慘跌、昨晨中國銀行標準、粵幣兌價、僅為六五零元、而匯兌之數、仍以一千元為限云、</p>

<p>壓軸戲一團和氣</p>
<p>六月五日爲我隊在爪最末賽期、對方爲吧城羣力靑年、兩華聯隊、吾人昨以七二比數大挫盟主後、各健兒於萬分努力之下、多感疲倦、今日彼此一家、自無熱烈爭逐、乃設法予勞者以休息機會、以左列人馬出戰、</p>

<p>包家平　譚江柏　麥紹渶　李國威　梁榮照　張顯源　楊水益　卓石金　孫錦順　黃美順　賈幼良</p>
<p>上塲零零、結果三比零、立功者江柏二、景祥一、</p>
<p>是戰同室操戈、雖爲我隊、最後表演、觀衆亦寥寥可數、彼此踢來、客氣非常、戰情毫不緊張、看台冷落、殊不足怪、上塲我隊表演平庸、以致各無建　、下塲以李天　生入代譚江柏、調汪柏與景祥至前綫、以代錦順石金、前鋒經此變動漸有生氣、由江柏景祥相繼建功、對方球藝平平無奇、即吾人認爲有望、及曾被選參加預選之李玉信、亦無驚人本領、我隊防綫、雖非十分堅强、應付亦綽有餘裕、終塲卒以三比零勝利、結束爪島之戰程、造成十勝一和之佳績、</p>
<p>査此種成績、一九三十一年南華曾一度造成同樣紀錄、我隊此番遊爪、擁更　之實力、應有更　之造就、然因賽期之促迫、天氣之炎熱、地利之失宜、我們的眞本領、並不能充分拿出來、而且爲着試探我們的陣勢、出塲人物次次不同、對合作上聊有影響、在爪十一塲的表演、自已認爲滿意的不過三幾　回而已、不過、在出國後的十幾回試騐中、我們雖然在當時有些犧牲、但到底還發覺多少自已的弱點、還算有點價値、關於球賽以外的觀感、這番每抵一埠、來去忽迫、好像走馬看花、委實看不出甚麽、最明顯的是僑胞對我們的期望殷切非常、如此而巳、關於爪島足球的詳情、記者希望在旬日內做一段專文論之、恐怕是國內球迷們所樂於一覩的吧、</p>

<p>六月五日把我們爪方的戰事結束後、當夜全吧僑團假大東酒樓設筵歡送、觥籌交錯、頗極一時之盛、宋總領致詞畢、由容君與記者相繼答謝、翌晨我隊爲趕赴星洲七日（星期日）對軍聯之戰、遂選拔球員十三各、由容主任統率、乘專機飛星、餘人則於今日下午趁輪至星會合、共赴棉蘭、計被選飛行的爲記名包家平·李天生·譚江柏·梁榮照·徐亞輝·陳鎮和·李國威·曹桂成·馮景祥·葉北華·鄭季良·黃美順諸人、五時起、洗盥後、即驅車至機場、天方放曉、機乃凌空出發、此十四人中、惟國威與季良爲破題兒、國威好奇心重、問三詢四、呶呶不休、季良則心如小鹿、戰慄不已、全隊益笑弄之、亞輝與小黑炭以航空生資格、口講指畫、解釋儀器之用法、頗感興趣、起飛後俯瞰城市山川、曆曆如在書圖、有時下顧雲海、蔚爲大觀、機過南蘇門塔臘時、但見林木森茂、一望無涯、凌空凡五小時、於十一時零五分抵降星洲機塲、危險關頭、又安然渡過、驅車回駐新亞旅店休憇、準備明日劇戰、</p>
<p>四隻鸭蛋贈軍聯</p>
<p>吾隊上月經星時、雖曾以四比零之　績擊破星聯、然各界咸以星聯本屆實力平庸、吾人勝之殊意中事、且勝來易易、尤以不能見吾隊之精彩表演爲憾、遂多慫恿足球當局、於吾隊再度過星時、選拔海陣空軍聯與我對抗、蓋軍聯擁雄師數旅、選精拔銳、其勢更盛、兩雄相遇、必有以醒球迷耳目、當局俯順衆意、斯赛乃於七號（星期日）舉行、一時星洲以外各埠球迷、爭先恐後、僕僕長途者大不乏人、當局鑒於上决球民之過度擁擠、秩序不易維持、（一球迷受擠身亡）故此番事預爲戒備、酌定祗許容納一萬六千人、過量則一律拒絕、其嚴重緊張、於此可見、事後聞是日距開賽前兩小時、已將球場水洩包圍、足證是賽吸引力之大、我隊除以包易黃守門外、餘人均照在吧以七比二戰勝吧盟主之陣綫應付、</p>

<p>上半時二比零、結果四比零、立功者　祥桂成北華惠堂各一、</p>
<p>軍聯人强馬壯、個個均碩大無朋、登場練習時、巳給予吾人以非常之威脅、五時開戰、彼方見球即傳、絕不停留、此種大刀糾斧之戰略、在最初十五分鐘、頗使吾人竊於應付、敵方兩翼傳中準確、中鋒身長六尺有奇、頭球攻門、殊覺危殆、幸包譚竭力招架、始免一失、十七分鐘時、景祥得季良低傳、先奏奇功、桂成繼之再下一關、造成上塲二零局面、易陣後、我方攻勢益熾、敵衛興守門應接不暇、顧此失彼、先後爲記者及北華、連陷兩關、四隻鴨蛋贈軍聯、博得中外人士同聲讚美、全僑更笑逐顏開、利用斯賽博而勝者、更喜形於色、勝利之神、功效之大、眞屬不可思議、我隊是日沿用此陣勢、實因吾人認爲最强之綫、不可更易、瞭解聯絡、日臻美妙、守衛方面、能守身如玉、不失一球、固屬難能可貴、而前鋒之銳利、於敵方守衛森嚴之下、能破四關、亦非易事、此陣勢爲吾人發覺後最强健者、於茲益信、吾人在球場平軟措施必覺美滿、於茲益信、而吾人見軟化軟、遇硬更硬、由近數塲表演觀之、更屬不訛了、</p>

<p>紗市續堅、漲風漸起、良以世界紗花市情節節前進、人心愈挺、空頭活動扒補、同時原棉堅昂致紗市更形鞏固矣、但現紗生意仍無發展希望、且倉庫中存紗仍在二萬包以外、紗市漲力猶多受其阻力云、</p>
<p>標紗收盤買氣突濃　標紗前市開盤、因海外紗花市價一意昂騰、空頭急於抵補、市塲人氣激昂、頭盤氣勢緊張、各月一律跳高開拍、各月均漲一元六·七角至二元三角、詎料二盤以後、因多頭乘漲時、突來紛紛出籠、籌碼鬆濫、市價轉　下游、結果各月比上日收盤價均漲六·七·九角至一元、惟本月漲一元八角、午後開盤、聞現紗交易不暢、人氣平平、二三盤均跌二·三角、迨至收盤、外棉消息反好、大阪三品紗本月漲四元、遠漲一·二元、買者雲集、市盤回振、結果各月比上午收盤價漲五·六·八角、惟本月跌三角、查賣出澄記一千八百包、通記一千一百包、達記四千包、錦昌一千六百包、明德一千三百五十包、愼記二千六百五十包、大昌成一千五百五十包、經華一千一百包、長豐二千二百包、買進右豐一千六百包、恒益九百包、裕大二千六百五十包、振大一千六百五十包　明華一千五百包、賡豐一千四百包、興昌一千三百九十包、長餘二千八百包、仁豐一千四百包、長豐一千〇五十包、大昶一千一百包、新華一千二百五十包、晋康一千四百五十包、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<h3>多頭獲利了結　棉花漲風遭阻</h3>
<p>棉市晨跌午漲、結果平平、但海外印美棉市漲勢依然劇烈、惟本埠一般獲利多頭、大批了結、以致　面鬆懈、市價反轉下落、多頭放棄本月、拖進七月期、現棉脚地奇緊云、</p>
<p>標　近跌遠漲　標花前市開盤、美棉續漲九至十六磅音、印棉漲勢益熾、昀漲二羅比半至三羅半、大阪三品漲五·六角、市塲人心在未　盤前、議論一致看高、詎料大批獲利多頭、乘機出橋、籌碼忽鬆、市盤反轉下　、結果各月比上日收盤均跌三·五角、新花跌五分、午後開盤、因多方仍來了結、市象帶疲、拍至三收盤、忽然轉挺、美棉消息仍有趨昇之望、空頭亦來扒補、市况由平轉緊、結果各月比上午收盤價均漲　角半至四角半、新花漲五分至一角、惟本月跌二角半、查賣出長和一萬一千一百担、源興昌五千六百担、晋康三千五百担、永大二千担、生源二千八百担、元一四千五百担、仁豐二千六百担、愼記五千一百擔、達記二千八百擔、大孚二千五百擔、明德四千三百擔、買進信誠七千五百擔、大昶三千四百擔、潤康八千八百擔、長豐八千一百擔、益昶二千九百擔、合興六千八百擔、裕大三千二百擔、　興三千四百擔、大豐一千一百擔、興昌一千七百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<h3>糧食　粉交因追證　祗做午後四盤</h3>
<p>六月份實行結價</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上午因六月份追證尚未舒齊、故仍停拍、迨至下午、則以六月份問題、已有解决途徑、聞經保方面之調停、從事結價、大約結價為三元四角二分、或傳賣方為四角七分、因此下午雖已開市、六月份則未照拍、至遠期各月份、初雖洋麥報漲四五角、至七八角一元不等、惟以日來新麥市値尚平、至源又達二三萬包、是以近期開價、曾小一分外、十一月份則堅定如常、惟以二盤以後、因外行買氣仍暢、市場人心、亦復步步提漲、且以本月份之殷鑒不遠、人人均不免仍懷戒心、市氣復佳、當屬此故云、</p>

<p>春秋</p>
<h3>滴點</h3>
<p>— （方正）</p>
<p>假使以白糖梅子來比喩靑年們的戀愛，那是最合適也沒有了，然而有許多靑年，却不肯仿着吃梅子般，吃一個換一個，只知偶到失戀，則自殺，投浦，幹出種種驚人的悲劇來，不知自身的價値，却萬倍於梅子呢！失戀的朋友！請三思而後行。</p>
<p>戀愛雖是靑年時季不可少的過程，但却也不能入於迷，因爲有許多有作爲的靑年，在沒有戀愛之前，無論作什麽事業都有一種進取的精神，一旦有了戀人，非但不求事業進步，而且終日沉迷於粉紅色的夢中，志氣頹喪，眞是可嘆！所以戀愛最易影響我們的前程，願天下靑年們，都加以注意。</p>
<h3>關於大觀園模型</h3>
<p>— 亞厂</p>
<p>楊令茀女士手製頤和園大觀園模型，玲瓏剔透，妙造自然；凡樓臺亭榭，曲欄房攏，山石之嶙嶒，草木之蓊鬱，園林景物，靡不維妙維肖，覽之令人悠然神往，彷彿置身於其間，女士洵所謂獨具匠心者矣。大觀園模型，女士十餘歲時卽從事經營，洎民八，大觀園模型完成，始携赴各地公開展覽，時女士自撰大觀園模型記一文，叙其搆製始末；偶檢篋衍，於舊札記中獲見此文，因迻錄之，以實春秋。</p>
<p>『余製大觀園，初未嘗一讀紅樓全書。八九歲時，好六法，苦無師，聞人言，學畫須從界畫入手，宋李營邱，明仇實甫，樓閣精絕，後人無復繼之者，牆頭適有大觀園全圖，余乃旦夕摹之；然余好建築，允甚於丹靑，刀鋸繩墨，雖亂離之時，倉皇走避，輒以自隨，讀書之隙，搆小屋，孜孜不倦。己未，出歷年所製，擇其完好者留之，得亭榭五六種，思搆一園亭，苦無圖樣，則倣幼年所摹大觀園而爲之，維時余知大觀園之典，出紅樓說部。紅樓爲小說之巨擘，既建斯園，不能不一玫園之出處，乃取紅樓讀之；既讀則大悔，曰：紅樓中人，皆余習見，戚　子弟如賈寳玉者，車載斗量，天下閨秀之鬱結自苦如林黛玉，又比比皆是，其餘諸人，勢利卑鄙，亦余趨避不遑者，然則其人其事，皆無足取，可取者惟其用筆耳；余何爲經之營之，爲若輩經營宮室，若是其用心哉？余園既誤用大觀園之名，人必謂余深於紅學，而崇拜其書者，故叙其始末如此。』</p>
<h3>鰣魚雋談</h3>
<p>— 淸癯</p>
<p>鰣魚春末夏初有之，非時不出，故原名「時魚」，人以魚類，加傍以專屬之，實則俗字也。此魚形秀而扁，似魴而長，大不過三尺，而其鱗耀人目，初起水，色白如銀，異於常魚，據捕者云：「網獲時，他魚無不跳躍以冀脫身，此魚則寂然不動，恐傷其鱗也」。而嗜之者，亦以其脂肪在鱗片中，至蒸食時，舉箸直視鱗爲無上之品。</p>
<p>唯肉多刺，其細如毛，故昔人列爲五恨之一。所謂『頗知自愛唯鱗好，難滿入情是刺多』，洵不誣焉。然誦『莫憎瘦骨搜難盡，便帶銀鱗嚼不妨，』是在知味者得之，而傖夫滿口大嚼，以致作鯁在喉，不吐不安，則非是魚之咎，乃不善食之過耳。蓋其膏質在層鱗間，故宜淸燉，經熱斯融，而其湯乃雋永無比，所以爲初夏之珍味者，卽在於此。</p>
<p>產生，在淡水海水之間，浙以富春江爲著。蘇則江江江陰亦頗有名，當初入市，其價極昻，吾邑則來自淞之石洞。今歲見市，已近立夏，可謂最晚已。然其値猶貴，非富有而具老饕之癖者，不敢過問焉。日前，某姓家喜筵，具有此肴，蓋購自滬上，以餉嘉賓者，而侍者不識，至客皆已飯畢，始端盤以上，有此佳味，而多不獲一嘗，傳爲話柄，殊堪爲喫『鰣魚』笑史中添一新紀錄也。</p>
<h3>石榴花開的時候</h3>
<p>— 周起鳳</p>
<p>石榴花開了，</p>
<p>開得那麽鮮艷燦爛，像火一樣。</p>
<p>一株，兩株，三株的牽連着，花朶是那麽多那麽紅，密密的擠擁着，遠望去，像空際展開一匹大紅的緞子。</p>
<p>初夏的風，懶洋洋地，像參和了不少酒精的成分，掠過城市，掠過原野，掠過如火如荼的石榴花，掠過石榴花下三三兩兩的紅男綠女。</p>
<p>發狂的歡笑，低聲的情語，甜美的歌唱，交織着脂粉的芬芳，輕飄的旗袍角，男人的尖頭皮鞋，構成現代資產階級靑年的　幅生活剪影。沒有苦惱，沒有悲哀，沒有憂愁，世界像爲他們而存在，石榴像爲他們而開花。</p>
<p>男人永遠是謙和的，老像背公式地說着：</p>
<p>『親愛的，你是我的生命原動力，失去你，我就不能活下去……是的，我的一切都屬於你的，每一個細胞，每一個……』。</p>
<p>女的照例撅起了嘴，頭出不耐煩的樣子，待男的嘮叨了一大串之後，纔稍稍背轉頭，迸出三個字：</p>
<p>『眞討厭』！</p>
<p>然而女的心裏，並沒有響應着「眞討厭」，到底還做了男子生命的「原動力」。在石榴花下，都很順利的完成了各人的一段羅曼斯。……</p>
<p>石榴花開了，</p>
<p>開得那麽鮮艷燦爛，像火一樣！但是燒不醒享樂者的麻木的心呵！</p>
<h3>粽子</h3>
<p>— 鷗</p>
<p>天氣是這樣的悶熱，在屋子裏喘一口氣都覺得費力，汗流出來像樹　質一樣，把衣服全點住了，彷佛皮外又多生了一張皮，累得小孩子們個個在發燥。唯有母親是個例外，這種黃　天氣對於伊，彷彿全不甘有什麽影響；伊照例還在前院後院的奔着，相帮那來家十四年的老媽子做着一切的家務，累乏了，至多取起冷茶夾喝一口，便又急忙忙的幹事去了。</p>
<p>我和九弟換上竹布長衫的第二天，祖父就從店裏派人送來了兩箕枇杷（那時候也不懂是紅沙還是白沙），我們先後用搶，偷，騙！種種的方法吃完了一箕之後，忽又連帶的想到了年常少不掉的粽子，並且想到粽子是應該和枇杷在一個時候吃的，便不管母親怎樣的忙，儘吵着伊要吃粽子。那一年老祖母恰巧有病在床，母親除照常經管家務之餘，還得給老祖母料理湯藥，實在是够忙了；再加那來家十四年的老媽子走路又慢，每上一次街總得隔一個多鐘頭才回來，一天上街三决，差不多就有大部份的時間在街上了，家裏衹讓母親一個人忙着。</p>
<p>然而伊是决不願意剝奪我們這一年的吃粽子底權利的，伊終於在百忙中抽出兩隻手來，給我們裹了許多肉粽和豆沙粽；日裏伊當然沒有工夫，這些粽子是累了伊一個深夜才裹起來。當我們明天早上起身，搶着敎那老媽子剝開粽子在吃的時候，母親却獨自懶洋洋地坐在一張竹椅上，望着我們苦笑；老媽子問伊要不要也剝一個，伊只是搖頭，待我們背着書包走出門口，彷彿聽見母親在嘔的聲音。九弟不懂事，還悄悄地對我說：「昨夜母親一定是粽子吃得太多了」，我比他大幾歲，雖知道他這個猜測是錯誤的，但也想不到爲我們怎樣的辛苦。</p>
<p>中午回家，母親頭頸裏紅油油，黑刺刺的已刮着好幾條痧痕了，飯也不曾吃；九弟看見粽子籃裏少了一半（那是拿去送人的），還想發脾氣，我就忙着按住了他。</p>
<p>這已是十八九年以前的事情了，但每逢端午節前後吃粽子，便少不得要在我的心版上重映一回。</p>

<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第三回　雨細風斜還來留跡處　夜闌人靜獨寫絕交書</p>
<p>江小姐呢，也不是上一次看到，那樣猛可吃驚的樣子，慢慢的走到身邊，臉上泛出淺笑來。這淺笑只在他嘴角　微的一動，和烏眼珠略略移轉的當中，可以領略出來。在十步以外，他總是在微　了頭之間，向這邊有來，等待走到十步以內，他就把　皮低垂下去了。國器在這個淺笑的過程中，算要是心裏最明白的一次，竟是手抬起來，要摘帽子和他行禮。但是手扶到帽沿的時候，自已又感到了有些魯莽，却沒有那勇氣，可以把帽子取下來，依然把手垂下來了。不過在扶帽沿的時候，臉上也可時的透着淺笑。這種淺笑，對方的人，是看到了的，他也照着很平　的樣子，把　淺笑收下，並不以爲國器的行爲，是出乎尋常的。這一次聚會過去了，國器的年紀若回去到五年以外，必定要在巷口跳上幾跳。現在雖是不便跳起　，可也就　得脚步輕鬆多了。他跟着這一次一次的機會，發揮　他心裏那一片不可遏止的情感，在第二次是很明顯的向他送出淺笑去。他已是走到了相距一步之內，雖是很淸楚的看到了，也不怎樣的害羞，很快的向國器看了一眼，才低頭而去。第三次，國器有些勇氣了，還是抬起手來扶着帽簷，作一個要點頭的格式。那江小姐的淺笑，但這樣的交際情形之下，也有點兒變了，在嘴角閃動時，巳是露出兩徘整齊的白牙，分明他　深深地笑了。這樣　個扶帽簷行禮，一個深笑答報的時候，大概有了二日。國器的母親章老太太，有點詫異了。當他同掉吃午飯的時候，章老太對他臉上看了一看，問道：孩子，你這幾天，有什麽心事嗎？國器自垂了頭吃飯，答道：沒有呀。章老太道：不能沒有吧？你在常回來，不是作稿，就是看書。這幾天，你上學堂去的時候，總是看釧看表怕時候晚了。回得家裏，好像檢到了什麽値錢的東西，滿臉都是笑容。但是你又坐不住，只是在書房　轉轉，又在床上躺躺，好像有一件高興的事，安頓不了。今天　星期日，你不必去敎書了。但是你還是常看　看表，忽忽忙忙，跑了出去。跑出去之後，你又　笑回來了。國器笑道：媽問的是這件事，這件事，果然是可笑的。我忘了今天是禮拜，忙　到學堂裏去。到了那裏，看到沒有一個人，我才曉得這是　拜，我　笑着回來　。（三八）</p>
<p>遊踪所至</p>
<h3>從瘦西湖到四五六</h3>
<p>— 愛梅</p>
<p>飄泊幾年，足跡還沒出過汀蘇一省，而且所到的地方，不是囂塵十丈的大都市，便是窮鄕僻壤的活地獄；要勉强說出個比較値得使我留戀的風景區來，那只有揚州的瘦西湖了。然而，我倒父和它闊別了二年啦！眞個是：塵俗滿身，說也慚愧！</p>
<p>這一次遊揚州，原有兩個目的：—第一，當然是一探久別的瘦西湖之勝了；第二呢？是爲了久聞省立揚中附辦的婦女生活班的大名，想去參觀一下。可惜，僅僅的空桑三宿，却天天都有的會，眞煩膩啊！幸而第二天的的會，飯局以外，便是遊湖，還算不曾虛負此行；但那婦女生活班，却終於沒去得成，這畢竟是該引爲此行之憾的。</p>
<p>那是一個風日晴和的下午，我和周，朱，一行三人，緩步出了北城，向着湖濱踱去，一路上淸風拂面，麗日披身；眞的！當這殘春甫盡，新夏初臨的時節，下午的氣候，眞呌人够覺舒適的了。</p>
<p>到得綠楊村前，便受了榜人的包圍；那一向馳名的船娘呢？却一個都不見。這自然是我們來得太遲之故了。我們看看天色，確巳不早，便决定了只遊小金山和徐園兩處，古人說得好：「無論登山或涉水，總得留着幾處不去，以供想念，吾則反而覺得索然興盡了。」我們很服膺這句名言哩。於是，我們跨上了僱定的一隻船。—說起船來，那是很簡陋的，一律都是僅僅的撐着張白布篷頂，下面設着三張籐椅，僅足容身罷了！</p>
<p>一篙點破了湖心，我們是蕩漾於綠波中了；斜陽覆映在水中，隨着波紋　動，折成萬道細碎的光芒，眞好算是金碧爭輝。我們躺在籐椅上，四顧週聞的野景，胸地霎時都覺一舒，確似撲去俗塵萬斛了。</p>
<p>我們隨意閒談着，朱偶然的問起了我：「共到這兒遊過幾决？第一次是什麽時候？」我說：</p>
<p>「遊的次數，記不淸了；提到第一次，那却够感慨的。那還是在六七歲時，家住揚州，隨着先君來過；我雖是小孩子，偏很知道愛達兒的風景，以後便天天總着先君要來，不然就哭了；切記有一次，哭得睡着了，次早醒米，依舊嚷着先君，先君便哄我說：夜來帶我去過，我却　得太熱，沒叫得醒；小孩子畢竟是小孩子，居然信了；但，這也爲了我夜裏恰巧夢見來遊過了的綠故哩」。說得周朱兩人都笑了。我却心裏一酸，陡覺眼前一切，都成了我個人不堪回首的傷心境地啦！</p>
<p>小金山和徐園的景物，一切還如舊觀，沒經修葺；我們各去徘徊一週，又在徐園合攝一影，已經暮色蒼茫，只剩晚霞一抹，遠掛林梢，眼見得夜幕就要下垂了。出得園來，我們又到重建的五亭橋橋上一看，倒是雕樑盡楝，煥然一新；我們略事憑眺，便放舟而歸了。</p>
<p>在萬家燈火中，我們連袂進城，到了新勝街的四五六菜館了。那兒有樣極美的名菜，乃是紅燒靑魚，尤其是單燒魚頭。我們前去晚餐，就爲了一嘗此味。吃時，果然名不處傳，僅僅的一隻魚頭，巳有一尺多長，上面充滿了魚油，烹調得鲜嫩無比，在旁的地方吃靑魚，眞個從沒嘗過這樣的滋味。</p>
<p>臨別，朱約着我和周：「中秋佳節，再到揚州一趟，好趁着團圓月色，到湖上暢遊半夜；或者　歲新春，去一探史公祠的梅花。」他說：「今天沒到的地方太多了！除了往常　過的不算，還有新建的熊園呢！到得中秋，當可落成，又多一處賞覽的佳景了。」這時，我忽然想起了平山堂的第五泉，從前雖去遊過若干次，却一總忘了吃泉水；便吿訴了朱，那知朱說：「泉水麽？那別提了！泉眼巳淤塞了快二年啦！」這樣一來，不禁使我惘然良久，覺得又替我增加了一件生平的憾事了！</p>

<h3>農村衛生工作困難原因與補救方法</h3>
<p>— 季步峯</p>
<p>我飄泊到江西西山來，雖服務只有幾月，對農村的情形不能十分明瞭；但我是生長在浙江農村，學校畢業後又是在農村裏搶飯吃，依我親眼着到的農村衛生現狀，大概相同，胆敢以個人淺見漫談於下：</p>
<p>社會一切的建設，都是站在經濟上面，無論談到那一項首先離不了經濟，現在農村經濟破產已至尖銳化，復興農村經濟，我們在農村衛生工作的小子，是萬萬辦不到的，自有大入物來負這重大的責任，我不能談，也不談了；不過我們在農村衛生工作，不得不顧及農村經濟現狀，擇農民經濟所可能的，簡單易行，切於實際，先指導農民做做，使人人皆能力行，皆得享受，收效比較優良，否則用洋化思想，來計劃各項衛生，閉門造車，不適於用，結果都是行不通，等於具文，僅在報吿表上塡得好看一點，自欺欺人罷了。</p>
<p>「江山易改，習慣難移，」這兩句話一點也不錯，我看有許多農民能行的，他們竟不行，完全是習慣難移，譬如房屋打掃淸潔，是相當易做的事情，他們竟任灰塵滿室，雞糞遍地，管他媽的，住在裏面吃飯睡眠，不覺得一點難堪，養成這不良的習慣，是幾千年來舊社會所造成，改良這惡習慣，亦非一朝一夕可以成功，我們只好抱漸化中義，乘機推進，切不可操之過急，反破害了與農民連絡的感情：養成良好的衛生習慣，最好是從兒童着手，現各保學要行强迫懲學制，各保學兒童卽爲農村全數兒童，當組織農村健康敎育委員會，推行農村學校衛生，使各兒童皆養成衛生習慣，學校是集團機關，我們指導方面也便利得多，又可敎他們做各種衛生宣傳，衛生敎育方面可得一絕大的助力呵。</p>
<p>農民缺乏科學知識對衛生尙少信仰心，我們雖以衛生的利益，極詳細的講解，說得天花亂墜，總是言之諄諄，聽之藐藐，想要頑石點頭是不可能，我們要如何使農民對衛生有信仰心，依我的經騐，最好由治療着手，農村衛生工作，重要的使命，當在於防病不在於治病，但農民主見竟相反，是重視治療，輕視衛生，例如有一〇七保某君身中二槍，八〇保某婦以剪刀自殺，刺入喉部深寸許，被我治愈，他們才信新醫是更好的，以後我到這二保去工作，比较別保順利得多。</p>
<p>農民深信迷信，一切災難皆是聽天由命，要種牛痘，供起天花娘娘來設壇，患了病拜在神前來求愈，病原病因一點都不明白，如有傳染病發生，更覺可憐可笑了，患病的不知什麽是傳染，隨意傳播，未病的亦不知什麼是傳染，隨意接觸，勢必大播特播，到死人遍地，棺木供不應求的時候，也只有請和尙道士，畫符打醮，眞是衛生工作一大阻力，我們要破除迷信，推行衛生，每日臨診的時候，對病人必須面吿，這病是怎樣發生，有怎樣的危險，怎樣才是合理的治療，怎樣才能預防不發生，其外尙要抱任勞任怨的决心，不管農民怪觸犯神怒，不理也好，面罵也好，我們對於迷信總要極力破除，有時還要利用政治力量來禁止。</p>
<p>農民識見愚昧，對我們總是另一階級的人看待，非是自視太輕，不敢與我們接見，就是懷疑懼心理，怕我們要向他身上想錢，抽稅派捐，避不見面，我初次至各保去訪問，與他們談話，有的回答：「是是。」以敷衍手段對付，有的立刻避開，甚至問保長家住那裏，也推自己不知，不肯實吿，以後經多次访問，與他們漸漸混熟了，才知道我對他們沒有非分索求，始有談話的機會，我們因農民知識低下，造成比憂越地位，推行工作，利用此優越地位，或政治力量，强迫他們去做，一時尙可行得通，但壓力一去卽失時效，非特是暫時曇花式的成績，往往反因此與農民發生一層障碍，工作上多添一種困難，我們想衛生工作，如何可深入農村，如何可永久存在，我們在農村衛生工作的時侯，態度要溫和，說話要誠懇，工作困難中一補救方法呵。</p>
<p>我最近出席農村衛生指導員會議，聽取各處報吿，多有工作困難的原因，發自同工，我們皆是右農村最前綫工作人員，竟有如此事情發生，是可愧可恥的行爲，每處的組織雖分衛生組，農業組，家事組，合作組，敎育組，各個分開，究其實質係整個的農村事業，我們應放大眼光，以事業爲前題，分工合作，用互助精神，使各組打成一片，以上所說各種困難容易打破，工作方得邁進，非特衛生工作的幸，亦爲各組之利呵。</p>
<h3>失眠症的原因及其治法</h3>
<p>— 子弗譯</p>
<p>人類於維持其生命，營活動生活中，必須有一定的時間，醒覺與睡眠互相交替地存在。這就是說，於一定時間的活動之後，必須停止活動，以求消除疲勞，恢復體力，這就是睡眠了。假使睡眠發生了不適或障礙時，那麽，這人的生活能力就會有着極大的低下。如果睡眠被阻礙到極點時，連維持生命，亦會發生困難。故康健的人，是有着很規則的晝夜交替，也就是說有着很規則的睡眠與醒覺的交替，以求順適地維持他的生命與活動力。</p>
<p>然則，所謂健康的人，究竟每日需要多少睡眠時間呢？這可以說是隨每個人而有不同的。大概幼兒需要較長時間的睡眠，以後隨着他的成長，從而睡眠的時間便逐漸减短了。</p>
<p>就一般說來，幼兒每日的睡眠時間自十小時乃至十二小時；成人的，自七小時乃至八小時；老人的，有較短的時間已足够了。</p>
<p>就健康人的睡眠狀態精細觀察，可以發見其睡眠的深度，經過了不同的時間，而有各種形態的變化。入眠後一至二小時間，是最深的睡眠，其後决第變淺，到近曉時再行入於稍深的睡眠狀態，這是一種。還有一種，是入眠後二至三小時間爲最深的睡眠，這樣繼續不久後，便徐徐地漸次變淺，比至近曉，卽行醒覺。</p>
<p>如上所述，在健康的狀態時，睡眠的來臨是有一定的時間。由是便可以　息疲勞，以謀繼續未來的活動。然而，假使在某種病的狀態中，睡眠發生障碍，於是便引起失眠症來。</p>
<p>於失眠症中，有一種是臥床後不容易入睡；有一種是入睡的狀態比較好些，但明早醒來時都覺得很困倦；還有有種是夜裏睡眠極淺，時時會醒轉來。此外，更有一種是旣不易入睡，而睡眠復極淺易醒，明早起來又極疲倦的混合型。我人於講求失眠症的對付方法之先，必須對失眠症型，加以精細的觀察。</p>
<p>失眠症的原因，是有着各色各樣的。例如腦的疾病，精神病，各種藥品或毒素的中毒，身體上別種病害的苦痛或疼痛，利害的咳喘，胃腸障碍，泌尿器障碍！……等，都有引起失眠症的可能。不過嚴格講起來，所謂失眠症，應當是以失眠爲主要的而又唯一的症侯。這種症候，多是受精神興奮的影響。尤以靑年及壯年，失眠症的原因以此居多。還有，是由於精神的過勞而起的，例如神經質者的失眠是。不過這裏有一點應當注意，常常有些其原因相同，而於每個人間所起的反應則大異。例如有一些細微的事件，於某些人是毫不足以作失眠的原因；但對另一些人，則會引起了精神的非常興奮，結果造成失眠。事情對每個人所引起的反應旣有如是的不同，因此，失眠症的原因當然不好一般地規定。祇能就每個人精細地審查，探究出其原因，以求對付的方法。</p>
<p>引起精神興奮的原因，有精神的過勞，煩悶，憂慮，自責，失望，危懼，悲愁……等。而其中最重要的，可推危懼，煩悶，憂慮等。例如學生爲了應考，拼命預備，溫習，直至夜深。這麽一來，待上床後，仍然殘留着精神的興奮，是會大大地妨害入睡的。</p>
<p>然而，若果用功而不致達精神過勞的程度，當然不會發生右述的那種情形。不過假使於其中再加進各種憂慮與危懼的念頭，是亦會成為重要失眠原因。</p>
<p>失眠症的對付方策，首先要盡可能地將能够引起精神興奮的原因除去。將那些能够招致危懼，煩悶，勞心，自責，悲愁，失望等的家庭糾紛，職業上的不滿與事業的失敗等，努力解除。誠然，祇靠當事人的力量，是不容易解决這種大困難的。因此，不能不需要其周圍　每個人大的助力。</p>
<p>大概有失眠症的，類多爲神經質的人。這種人，遇到細小的事情，卽可成爲失眠的原因，所以最好能够極力避免刺戟。同時寢室的溫度要適當，空氣流通要良好，盡可能地避去音響與光錢，晚餐不耍喫得太飽，夜間不要喝茶，咖啡及酒等，有規則地排泌，有一定的就眠時間。凡此種種，都應當加以深切的注意。此外，還不能不極力避免夜間精神的過勞。尤其是學生們，雖至甚忙的時候，切忌過度用功。須於一定時間休止，幷須略事休息後，纔可就寢。</p>
<p>有時，當神經衰弱或過勞到較深的程度，最好能暫時離開職業，轉到較靜的地方休養。然而，在這種塲合，海岸與高山亦不適宜。因爲那種地方，足以引起失眠的事情極多。不過，若果無法轉地休養及離開職業，那祗好於日間規定一定的休息時間，或從事畫寢。能於日間多作戶外的柔軟體操，亦是一非常有益的事。</p>
<p>凡連續地受輕微而單調的刺戟，例如傾聽單調而柔靜的音樂，數數目，數呼吸的决數等，都可以幫助睡眠。同樣的，全身受輕微的電氣摩擦或人工摩擦，亦可以助睡眠。</p>
<p>入浴於微溫的水中，繼續較長的時問，淤助眠亦如有効。若能於入浴後繼續施行電氣摩擦或人工按摩，是更好了。又，於溫水浸浴後，用乾毛市包裹全身，更於其—纏以毛巾，休息三十分鐘左右，使精神鎭靜，亦極有利於睡眠。</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>最後，談到安眠藥。這個可以不用時，最好能够不用，而努力以別種方法帮助睡眠。若果到了萬不得已，非用不可時，則於服用後如稍見收効，便可卽行廢棄，改用他種方法。還有，服用安眠藥，應使用副作用最少的藥品。服用以少量為妙。而且藥品的種類，要常常掉換。自己手邊購置了某種藥品，而又自己隨意服用的人，是不大高明的。因為這樣做，一方面慣用一種藥品，便需要漸次增大服用量，終至造成中毒；他方面，慣於倚賴藥品，將來恐造成了沒有藥品就不能睡眠。故事先必須經醫師的指導，然後服用。</p>
<p>安眠藥中，有一種是起作用速而藥力消失早；有一種是起作用遲而藥力保持長。對於不易入睡的人，以用前者為宜；睡眠淺而早是容易早醒的人，以用後者為佳。若為混合型的失眠症，則以這兩種藥劑適當地混合使用為合理。但這事必須由醫師處理，若平常人隨意配合，是最易弄出極大錯誤的。</p>
<p>還有，安眠藥的服用，必須照醫師所指定的時間及方法。性急的人，於夜間不能入睡時，便立卽服用。這不特沒有什麽効果，反而常會引來翌朝種種不適的副作用。</p>
<p>總之，原因的因子不除去，而祇濫用藥品，以求睡眠，這是最愚蠢的方法。</p>
<h3>疾病常識問答</h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（八十六）肝濃瘍Abscess　of　Liver</p>
<p>什麽呌做肝膿瘍？</p>
<p>肝膿瘍就是肝臟化膿的疾病，所以也稱為化膿性肝臟炎。（Hepatitis　Supperativa</p>
<p>起肝膿瘍的原因是怎樣的？</p>
<p>大都續發於他部的化膿性病症，像腸潰瘍，蟲性痢疾，蚓突炎，敗血性心膜炎，肺壞疽，腐敗性支氣管炎，化膿性胆囊炎，膽石，蛔蟲等。也有因外傷而起的。</p>
<p>肝膿瘍，在患部很小的時候，病人起怎樣的病狀？</p>
<p>如果膿瘍很小的時候，雖使是多發性，也不起什麽病狀。</p>
<p>肝膿瘍化大的時候，病人覺得怎樣病人訴肝臟部的鈍痛，或劇痛，向右肩放散。</p>
<p>他覺的有什麽病狀？</p>
<p>他覺的症狀是肝臟腫大，膈膜舉上，肺境界處的呼吸時的移動性减少，呼吸困難，嘔吐和吃逆。若肝臟向下方增大，肋骨弓下膨隆，時呈波動，有知覺過敏或劇痛。觸着就起咳嗽。</p>
<p>病人有無發熱？</p>
<p>大都先有惡寒然後發熱。但也有不發熱的。</p>
<p>肝膿瘍病人，同時起脾臟腫大嗎？</p>
<p>脾臟普通並不腫大。</p>
<p>發生黃疸嗎？</p>
<p>大都也不發生；但有時因為膽道受着壓迫，可以黃疸的。</p>
<p>病人的血液中，有無異狀？</p>
<p>肝臟膿瘍的時候，血液中白血球增多。</p>
<p>這種病的經過怎樣？</p>
<p>看原來的病變怎樣而有變動。若原病是敗血性的，大都急性而取不幸的轉歸。若原病是膽石之類，那末成慢性經過。又往往要向腸管，氣管或腹壁破潰。</p>
<p>怎樣診斷肝膿瘍？</p>
<p>如果可疑的時候，須行試騐穿刺，看有沒有膿汁吸出。因為往往和傳染性膽道炎，膽囊蓄膿和肝臟附近的膿瘍難於區別。</p>
<p>這種病豫後的吉凶怎樣？</p>
<p>大多數是不良的，往往致命。</p>
<p>治療方法怎樣？</p>
<p>除原由於蟲性痢疾須行吐根素的注射外，其他概須施行外科手術，切開排膿，但結果也不能有多大希望。</p>
<h3>耳鼻喉眼疾病衛生常識</h3>
<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（九十一）曈孔反應</p>
<p>瞳孔反應原為虹彩所具有的一種特別機能。是由瞳孔括的肌及瞪孔開大肌的交互作用而起。牠的反應乃係一種反射性。所以瞳孔反應是不能由我們的意志而調節的。瞳孔反應在診察內科疾患的時候。實有重大的意義。往往給予醫師很有價値的輔助。瞳孔反應可以分為縮瞳反應及散瞳反應的二種。就中縮瞳反應更可分為光綫反應，輻輳反應，瞼裂閉鎖反應，及三叉神經反射。茲特分述如左。</p>
<p>光綫反應　我們在暗室內試將光錢照射瞳孔。則能立卽引起縮瞳運動。是卽所謂光綫反應。這種縮瞳運動，是由視神經與動眼神經核的連　反射而起。光綫反應別有兩種。一種是光錢射入瞳孔所起的反應。稱曰直接反應。他眼所起的反應。稱曰間接反應。兩種反應常常同時發生。反應持續的時間。的為半至一秒。</p>
<p>輻輳反應　命被檢者先視遠方。突然再令注視眼前相當距離的一點。則瞳孔卽起縮瞳運動。是卽所謂輻輳反應。這種縮瞳運動，乃係動眼神經所支配的區域內，具有的一種共同運動。</p>
<p>瞼裂閉鎖反應　在瞼裂强度閉鎖的時候。常起縮瞳運動。此因與眼臉輪匝肌的共同運動而起。</p>
<p>三叉神經反射　在結膜，角膜，及虹彩的三叉神經區域內，受有刺戟的時候。多起縮瞳運動。所以在結膜炎，角膜炎，角膜異物，及虹彩炎等時。常能察見縮瞳現象。</p>
<p>此外在睡眠或麻醉期中。瞳孔常來縮小。稱曰睡眠縮瞳。</p>
<p>散瞳反應當　精神興奮或身體他部知覺受有刺戟（譬如驚愕，疼痛）的時候。常能由反射的作用而來散瞳運動。</p>
<h3>牙齒常識問答（三四）</h3>
<p>— 林鑑賢</p>
<p>第七章　牙患的治療</p>
<p>（第一七一問）　我國向來捉牙蟲的人，眞能治療牙蛀牙痛嗎？</p>
<p>答　前面第六三問已經說過，蛀牙的原因，並不是一種看得見的牙蟲。我國人因為向來沒有細菌學的知識，看見水果木竹等的蛀蝕，有時由蟲而起，遂以為牙齒也是這樣的。一般奸滑的人，利用這種荒謬的心理，就創造出許多欺偽的方法，自謂能够捉牙蟲治牙蛀牙痛等患。直至今日，靠此謀生的，還是滿佈全國，這眞是文明世界中的一個怪現象！他們如果眞能够捉出活的牙蟲來，這蟲决不是病人口中本來有的，是他們自己帶來的。他們完全是藉此愚弄一般無知識的人罷了。</p>
<p>（第一七二問）　有些人說，經過捉牙蟲的治療後，蛀牙的疼痛立卽减輕，這是什麽緣故？</p>
<p>答　捉牙蟲的往往用銅針刺破牙肉，放去很多血液，說是毒血，這樣一來，患牙的充血程度减少，疼痛自然會稍覺緩和，但這是一時的現象，並不是病已治愈，不久依舊如前疼痛。而且牙肉經過沒有消毒的銅針的穿刺，危險很多。</p>
<p>第三節　關於牙根膜炎的治療</p>
<p>（第一七三問）　非傳染性牙根膜炎，怎樣醫治？</p>
<p>答　如由局部刺激物而發生的應該先除去剌激物，加係關節炎梅毒或內服藥等所引起的，一定要用全身療法。减輕痛苦的法子，病家自己可行的，就是　用碘酒或烏頭酒塗佈於患牙附近牙肉的外面；　內服止痛藥；　用熱水浸足，每决的半小時。</p>
<p>（第一七四問）　急性傳染性牙根膜炎（卽齒槽膿瘡），怎樣醫治？</p>
<p>答　初期的療法，應事開髓室，貫通根管，用消毒藥水冲洗，封以消毒藥，牙肉外邊，用鳥頭酒及碘酒塗佈，同時並用瀉劑發汗劑及熱水浸足法等，以上諸法，目的在於消炎解痛；但若濃汁積聚，不能消去時，則須設法促其早熟，開刀放膿，諸症自消。在經過期中，如疼痛劇烈或失眠，應服止痛安眠等藥；大便宜用瀉藥使其通暢；又口腔極力使其淸潔，可常用漱口藥水漱口。</p>

<p>關於工作方針，除普通防疫注射，舉行衛生展覽等，仍根據上屆連續辦理外，尤以下列數事定為本屆衛運之重心！</p>
<p>（一）兒童衛生　兒童為民族未來主人，關　國運盛喪，其身心健康首應重視；况今年為兒童年，對於兒童之幸福事業，當格外注意，本屆衛運因亦首先標揭兒童之中心，凡所活動務使兒童之衣食住行各得切實之指導，收穫預期之效益。</p>
<p>（二）婦嬰衛生　婦女與嬰孩之衛生，有關種族興替，豈僅每一家庭之切身問題。本屆衛運擬於此點特別提示，無論於宣傳方面，展覽方面，務以婦女及嬰孩以及生育過程中各種切要常識，為之寶用的灌輸於市民，俾於家庭健康種族優秀，期有增進。</p>
<p>（三）夏令衛生　此係適應夏令節季，對於蚊蠅臭蟲之滅除，新鮮食物之保藏諸切要問題，本會另編夏令衛生常識小册一種，以簡潔明瞭之文字，實用簡便而有效之方法，協助一般中下市民解除其夏令衛生諸困難問題。</p>
<p>（四）衛生訓練　本會鑒於一般茶樓酒館旅棧理髮所浴室娛樂塲所等公共塲所，關　市民健康影響甚鉅，而時雖有各種規則取締，究以知識關係，或未解法令用意，收效有限，因於此次衛運期內，自十六日起一個星期內，舉辦全市公共塲所衛生知識訓練，由社會公安兩局分別轉知各該業主或派代表，就近向滬南滬北高橋江灣吳淞五衛生事務所報到受訓，由各該所授以各科簡易之消毒法傳染病公共衛生及各業取締規則各業厲行新運辦法等。</p>
<p>（五）淸潔運動　淸潔運動之目的，乃以勞動服務精神為手段，喚起一般民衆注意淸潔，本市新運會靑年服務團，公安局等己行之再，俱頗收效。查淸潔為衛生之初步手段，亦為基本條件；故此次仍煩新運靑年服務團公安局警士保衛團員保安隊及淸道夫等合力工作，計分全市為十四個區域，由市長衛生局長新運會等領導，自十五至廿日凡六天，依次辦理完畢。又廿七廿八兩日檢查公共塲所，亦由上開機關共同辦理。</p>
<p>本籌備會以上列各項工作為重心，自發起籌備，計開全體會議三次，各組委員會會各一次，所有大會各項設施，庶皆大致規訂，由主席及總副幹事負責進行，預定本屆大會之活動，可得槪要如左：</p>
<p>宣傳方面　有彩印鐵皮標語及竹布橫幅遍懸全市，各大日報每日輪流出版本特刊，閘揚衛生理論，印發婦嬰衛生夏令衛生常識。又請定名流及專家在市府福音中西等電台，逐日播講衛生知識。</p>
<p>展覽方面　在民敎館佈置會塲，出品陳列者有南京衛生署，中央工廠檢查處，本市衛生局，及公共租界衛生處等，計圖表樣型標本等，共達五千餘件，此項展覽自十五日起直到三十日大會閉幕止。</p>
<p>表演方面　以兒童衛生婦嬰衛生為中心，每日在會塲排定中心活動項目，請由有關機關團體參加表演，並用游藝或電影助興。</p>
<p>推行方面　推行工作在本屆衛運佔重要之地位，同時辦理亦較費周章，其內容有淸潔運動勞動服務，一般公共塲所衛生知識訓練，檢查公共塲所，及勸陰吐痰運動，推行工廠衛生等。</p>
<p>總之：本屆衛運鑒於時勢需要，其工作對象應為多方面的，而非局部的；應有活動中心的，但並非有所偏廢的。本此方針，當免隕越，茲値開幕，仍請各界賢遠進而敎焉！幸甚。</p>
<h3>工廠衛生的意義和幾種重要的辦法</h3>
<p>— 李宣果</p>
<p>上海市第十五屆衛生運動，指定今日為宣傳工廠衛生日，要鄙人來作演講的宣傳，諸位都是本市工業界勞動界的領袖，我想對於本問題，一定是會發生重大的注意者，構們顧名思義的先把「工廠衛生」的字義來解釋一回，我們都知道「工廠衛生」這個名詞已經祗是一個習慣應用的名詞、不能包括全部工作的範圍了、就把我們這次展覽會的佈置業計劃來說，我們是要把本市衛生行政，對於我們人生過程裏的貢獻，按着次序，表演出來，所以我們的總標題、是「衛生與人生」第一部便是「女嬰衛生」，從姙娠出生起便築好健康的基礎，年齡的增進，到了求學的時代，「學校衛生」開始了，那是第二部，學業完畢便到了職業時期；狹義的說，每一個人，在學成以後當然不是都到工廠裏去工作，「工廠衛生」名詞上似乎不能代表一切對於職業時期衛生的工作，不過廣義的來講，工廠裏固然是做工，不在工廠裏也不能說不是工作，工作總是一樣，有人要把用腦和用力分成兩種工作，那是一個錯誤，我們現在都知道用體力的、尤其是在現代機器的應用上說、未始不要用腦，用腦的工作，有時也要有相當體力，不足應付，還有一個對於用腦和用體力有沒十分差別、很正確的證明，便是無論用腦或用體力、在超過能力範圍的時候、一樣的都有疲勞的感覺、這都是生理上的問題，我們暫且不必深論，所以把「職業衛生」來代替「工廠衛生」似乎是比較貼切些，上面己經說過，我們暫且依着習慣的應用，將工廠衛生歷史的演進來討論一回</p>
<p>工廠衛生歷史的進展：我國以農立國，工廠的發達，不過是最近十幾年的事業，就以工業稱雄的歐美各先進國的經過情形、來攷察、其實有系統的也僅僅不過有百年以上的歷史·在西歷一七六七年距離現在百七十年左右因為紡織機的發明，己有大規模的紡織工業當時還是奴隸制度時代，工人每日工作十六小時鞭打鍊繫，死亡便秘的埋了了事社會上認工廠是萬惡的塲所。英國有一個統計；在西歷一八三三年在孟施斯脫一個工業要鎭裏工人們的壽命，平均不過廿二歲。在本鎭較好的社會裏，每人平均壽命却有四十四歲，相差竟有一倍之多並且當時英國全國的死亡率是十分之二十二在工業區裏却是千分的三十六·当时所以有人把工厰當層宰塲，實在不能說是誇大其辭·救濟的規劃，因此便漸漸發殿·英國在西歷一八〇二年便有工廠法令在議院裏通過了·法令的要點略舉如下：工人每日工作不得過十二小時；工人每年發衣服兩套，工人必須有讀書的機會；學徒必須登記；工廠房屋，每年必須刷白二次；定期要受法官或敎士的視察·以後逐漸的進展，重，要的譬如一八三三年英國國家派定工廠檢查員一八四四年限制童工的年齡和女工的雇用；一八四七年女工和童工的工作每日不得過十小時，一八五四年公布工廠安全法·以後便有對於危險性職業，女式童工雇用的限制，然後逐漸的便益臻完備了·上面是英國的情形·其他歐洲各國也有同等的努力；璧如德國柏林的工業衛生博物院，（一九〇四年成立）維也納工業衛生博物院（一九〇九年成立）把工業和健康的關係，疾病和危險，詳細表示出起因和預防的辦法，那是値得我們紀念的，一九一三年社會保險的完成，也是工廠衛生的重要紀念，美國工業衛生之起點，由保護童工起，一八八八年便有工廠檢查專員，國家設立許多的協會，來研究工業的衛生和安全的問題；成績是十分的優異·最近二十年來所値得我們注意的，便是各廠方自動的參加，或研求改進種種工業衛生的問題，對於從前拒絕工廠檢查的態度，完全改變了·工廠衛生是勞資雙方的裨益，也經大家的公認了，上面的事實告訴我們，工廠衛生的歷史，可以分為三期：第一期是黑暗時代，資方只求多事生產，以謀厚利；工人是完全處於壓逼地位的·第二期是救濟時期，許多的慈善家本着惻隱之心，來設法救濟一般受摧殘的社會份子·努力的訂定法律，和法律的施行，大都同情於勞方，對於資本家，多取制裁的態度·最近進了第三時期，可以說是工廠衛生經濟化的時期·大家一致的承認工廠衛生的注意，不從勞方直接受其福利，便是資方，間接的也受到經濟上裨益·唇齒輔車，是互相為用的·這類的進展，我們認為非常滿意的，因為無論任何事業，經濟的裨益，決無不樂予接受，所以工廠衛生的前途，我們也就可以十分的樂觀了。（待續明日新聞報）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>令人想起科舉時代的科學</h3>
<p>— 敬</p>
<p>我對於運動一門，本來感不到甚麽興趣，平日體育界消息，某人打破某項紀錄，某人打破某種紀錄，我絕不關心，所以對於體育一門，一點也沒有路道，更有什麽資格去批判，或是評論。</p>
<p>惟對於近日甄拔選手一事，令人不能不來饒舌幾句，此决世運選手，自經選拔委員評判公布後，連日報上紀載是項新聞，攻擊得體無完膚，不是說「選舉不公」，便是說「選舉舞弊」，不是說「甄拔質疑」，便是說「自欺欺人」，眞鬧得烏烟瘴氣，五色目迷，我深為不解。</p>
<p>此次甄拔選手，應有一定標準，跳得怎樣高，跑得怎樣遠，費了多少時，及格的當然當選，不及格的當然落選，卽使多不及格，則於不及格中跳得最高，跑得最遠，費時最少的當選，這是鐵一般的定律，千夫所指，萬目睽睽，選拔委員無論怎樣膽大包天，威權蓋世，應亦不敢顚倒是非，任情選拔。</p>
<p>起初我有一點疑心，疑心落選諸公，有吃醋關係，或者為了地域關係，有些吹毛求疵，這到也是情或有之的事，後來一考事實，則大謬不然，完全係選拔委員，濫用職權，感情用事，致被體育界一致攻擊，選拔委員亦知理屈辭窮，選拔差誤，但到底不肯矯正其非，言論界之譁然責難，絕無私意雜乎其間，已可概見，惟選拔世運選手一事，極關重要，對內則鼓勵全國國民的尙武精神，對外則一掃東亞病夫的恥辱，今選拔委員，如此不顧公論，一意孤行，殊屬令人大大的失望。</p>
<p>一，此决我國選拔參加世運選手，必須組織選拔委員會者，原欲得公平確當之選士也，近來歐洲各國，對於運動一事，異常努力，故程度甚高，我國健兒，欲參加世運，卽使挑擇超等人才，猶難與强敵抗衡，今乃舍其優而選其次，未識選拔諸委，是何居心。</p>
<p>二，此次决參加世運，有數十國之多，錦標之奪得，頗與國家名譽攸關，故近日美黑人拳擊家喬魯易，被德希滿林擊倒，德宣傳部長郭培爾卽去電道賀，謂「足下之勝利，卽係德國之勝利，是卜為元首希特勒爭光，亦足自豪矣」云云，反之，足下之倒霉，卽德國之倒霉，今我國甄拔選手，舍其上駛而取中駛，選拔委員的心理，欲為國爭光乎？願為國家倒霉乎？</p>
<p>三，此次我國參加世運，赴德比賽，聞一切經費，的須二三十萬元之鉅，當此民窮財盡的時期，籌措此欵，亦非易事，今選拔委員，完全以感情用事，並不公平選擇，則此行比賽結果，其成績不言可知，是以數十萬元之金錢，僅以供少數人酬應之情面，非特此種金錢，浪費可惜，而選拔一舉，亦屬多事，卽由選拔諸委，親戚朋友中，任擇數人可矣，何必有選拔之形式哉。</p>
<p>因此我想到滿淸時代的科舉，科舉之弊，人人皆知，夾帶，搶替，通關節，無奇不有，因而被人駡之齒冷，科舉因而廢止，但主考官若被御史彈參，一經問實，輕則革職，重則腦袋搬塲，揄才大典，原非小可，現在甄選世運選手所不同的地方，的有數點，從前主考官舞弊，必須治罪，今選拔委員舞弊，可不負責任，從前舞弊，尙是秘密行為，現在舞弊，可以明目張膽，國家到了如此地步，而稍有權藉，便施展神威，毫無顧忌，所以科舉之制可廢而不可廢也。</p>
<h3>枇杷</h3>
<p>— 紀難</p>
<p>書齋前面是一個三面圍牆圍起來的寬不及丈的天井，從書齋的窗口望出去，天不過是那麽窄小的一方，眞無愧是一口天的井。然而這口井裏却奇蹟似的長着一棵枇杷樹。</p>
<p>枇杷，與鬱悶的梅雨同來的枇杷，它並沒有梅子的酸味，是初夏裏最受人歡迎的水菜。</p>
<p>這種可愛的菓樹，居然會生長到這個窄小的天井中來，非但不相稱，而且</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>簡直是未免太「屈尊了，所以不能不說是一種「異數」。</p>
<p>那末，這「異數」到底是怎樣一段因緣呢？事情是這樣的。</p>
<p>不知道是那一年，也不知道是那一個，無意中隨手丟了一顆剛從嘴裏吐出來的枇杷核在這個天井裏，後來就長出了這棵樹。起初，當它還是一棵初長出來的小樹的時候，沒有人能够說它的前身就是一顆枇杷核，也沒有人能够認識它到底是一棵什麽樹：有人說它是桃樹，也有人說它是梅樹，李樹…，一直等到它結成了第一顆果實時　讓它自已來說明了。</p>
<p>「無心栽柳柳成蔭，」原來這到是一棵道地的枇杷樹呢！</p>
<p>由於三面圍牆的限制，道棵樹失去了發展的自由，它的本身很高，枝葉在　牆的高度以上纔放開來，形成了一頂長柄的寳蓋，並不像普通菓園裏看見的一樣。</p>
<p>因此，當果實成熟了的時候，雖然纍纍的金黃色的圓球在綠葉的掩映下開始引誘我，可是「高不可攀」，就祗能眼看着小鳥去剝啄而「可望不可卽」。</p>
<p>所以，這些可愛的金黃色的枇杷，在我看來，不過是些開得飽滿的美麗的花朶而已，那是祗能飽眼福而不能飽口福的。等到它熟透了自動的落下來時，還不是像殘敗而謝落的花瓣一樣。然而，當我一眼望見它在陽光裏被照耀得鮮艶奪目時，到底不免要「垂涎欲滴」地「仰樹興嗟」起來。</p>
<p>「垂涎欲滴」就是不渴的表示，想不到枇杷與梅子同功，也有意想不到的止渴的效力了。</p>
<h3>阿根（續）</h3>
<p>— 卓爾</p>
<p>如果要承認她是「五隻洋」的話，那麽當她拉上了淡綠色的窗帘的夜晚，就該有人稱贊她底「生意」不錯了。隔幾天總要有這麽一次的，那時，她就像是一個巧妙的魔術師似的變出了一個給她祗發生「五隻洋」的關係的人物來。她嘻笑着，任他調笑，摸弄，……末了就拉上了窗帘。……這是一幅多麽不協調的圖畫呵！在「五隻洋」的醜陋的話布上畫了出來。</p>
<p>最近，在白天也很少見阿根在弄堂裏走動，於是男人們感到了幾分寂寞的枯燥，女人們可開心了，她們咒駡着這個多媚的狐狸精，最好是趕快的死掉，那就可以放却對於自己心愛的男人們的監護的責任。可是，事實出於她們的意料之外的是：阿根仍然會輕巧的在弄堂裏穿過，使她們更加嫉妬的是她打扮得更加漂亮了。好事者終於探聽出她現在正給某店的老板打得火熱。</p>
<p>隔了好多日子之後的一個晴明的早上，弄堂裏堆滿了人，玩皮的孩子們，有閒的男人，女人，囂嚷着，像是有了什麽大事發生了似的。有一個胖胖的中年婦人指手劃脚的駡着：「弗要面孔，勾引人家的男人……爛汚×。」她正指着阿根房間，這可以使人豁然大悟的是那個胖女人一定是那個老板娘了！同時，還有很多的女人帮她的忙呌駡着些什麽：「偷人家的漢子的爛汚×……」等等難堪的話語。人們嘩笑着。就是年輕的小姑娘也紅着臉夾在裏頭打聽着些什麽……大家被戲謔的狂浪包圍了。</p>
<p>「滾出來！爛汚×，打死你……」胖老板娘臉紅脖子粗的駡着。「滾出來！……」</p>
<p>突然的，出人意料之外的阿根蓬鬆着頭髮衝了出來。臉上掛着淚，後邊跟着她底年老的媽媽。她英氣勃勃地叉着腰，一手指着那個胖女人：</p>
<p>「你駡誰？呵，什麽爛汚不爛汚！我並不是勾引你的男人，說實話，我……我是要他底錢。……我們窮，……我有老媽媽，家裏有老爸爸……還有小弟弟！……他們都要錢用！……你的什麽臭男人，誰沒見過男人，……誰也不要勾引他，是他自己願意來，給我錢我就要！…哼，這算不了什麽弗要面孔，你們不是也都有男人的嗎？……你們才是弗要面皮的呢！……爛汚！你們不爛汚？你們不爛污？……」</p>
<p>她的話還未講完，那胖胖的女人一面嘴裏嚕囌着些什麽，一面把手一揮，於是她，和那些給她同來的女人們就一湧向前的把阿根來扯倒在地上了。……　　　（續星期六）</p>
<h3>黃皮</h3>
<p>— 仇同</p>
<p>橙黃色的太陽，斜斜地照在黑骨二的茅屋上。從林子裏，間有一陣陣微風吹來，十分凉快地，全沒有絲毫暑意。</p>
<p>黑骨二拿着大頭竹烟筒坐到門前的一塊靑石板上，心痛地歎了聲，然後開了水烟匣子，捏出小姆指般大小的團子，按在烟筒上，點上火，使勁吸着。淡淡的烟絲在喘口氣的當兒，從那枯　的嘴裏噴了出來，像幾條小靑龍似的，游着，可是立刻就解了體，消失了。……</p>
<p>「嘟！嘟喲！」</p>
<p>突然一陣急暴的呌聲，破了四邊的沈寂。按着一輛長途汽車衝過前面去。隨着車後的烟霧送來一陣「軌士林」的臭味。</p>
<p>「丟那媽，臭屁蟲！」</p>
<p>黑骨二憤憤地罵起來。汽車在他身邊開過的四隻笨重的橡皮輪，好像碾着他的心一樣。他恨不能一烟筒把他打翻了。</p>
<p>兩年以前，黑骨二手頭還寬裕。他有着兩進單開的瓦屋和一個黃皮園。</p>
<p>一天，他挑着空貨筐從街上回來。他的兒子眼裏孕了一包令人恂慄的憂鬱光芒，走近來說：</p>

<h3>蘇州人（二四）</h3>
<p>— 顧文宗作</p>
<p>驚鴻　為甚麽不該加呢？難道有甚麽可忌的嗎？</p>
<p>麗雅　那是自然，我恨的就是蘇州，難道你不知道嗎？</p>
<p>驚鴻　知道你恨蘇州，但是不知道你為甚麽發起呌我蘇州姐姐？</p>
<p>麗雅　呌你蘇州姐姐的緣故。就因為你那麽蘇州妹妹在輪船上說的話：完全是拍馬屁！好拍馬屁恭維人的；就是蘇州人特有的個性！蘇州妹妹你說是不是？</p>
<p>麗雅　你不用問我，旣然你都明白了，我何必再給你解釋呢？我不跟你多說話了，再見吧。</p>
<p>驚鴻　這是第三句再見了，要不要再來一個再見？（說畢笑了一陣）</p>
<p>麗雅　絕不能留着讓你取笑我，我走了不送！不送！（一陣皮鞋由近而遠）。</p>

<p>何芸芳何琴芳雙珠球</p>
<p>中西（一〇四〇）下午一時至一時三刻</p>
<p>開篇「寳玉祭晴雯」</p>
<p>良辰美景佳節臨。芙蓉滿園倍傷神。千古紅顏皆命薄。可憐一病竟離魂。小婢凄凉根情說。寳玉是，淚珠涔涔濕衣襟。今晚是，敬具蘋繁水餃穀。心香一瓣寄與芙蓉神。姐姐啦，你在白帝宮中靈未泯。謪降花前莫却情。姐姐是，自臨人世年十六。相與祇有五年零。生前麗質冰淸潔。花慚月羞貌傾城。可憐呀。天生聰敏遭物忌。鳩鴆惡膏古來云。自蓄辛酸憐夭折。芳蹤　後何處尋。父聽得，慧棺被燹傷　痛。今生難遂共穴情。曾記得，眉黛烟靑猶我畫。到今朝，指環玉冷倩調溫。鼎爐餘樂今尙在。襟淚餘痕漬尙新。而今是，孤念有夢同誰訴。叉覺得，空室無人影亦零。此刻是，露階月暗芳魂渺。只聽得，匝地悲聲蟋蟀鳴。却不料，海棠枯萎非昔比。迄今是，簾前鸚鵡猶呼卿。黃土壟中卿命薄。茜紗窗下極多情。死別生離　前定。紅顏福慧見幾人。且待我，空門參禪撇紅塵。</p>
<p>徐文璧開篇</p>
<p>同業（七二○）午夜一時至一時三刻</p>
<p>開篇「牡丹」</p>
<p>牡丹花國獨稱王。它那時，綠葉紅花景色揚。富貴獨標奇品格。位居領袖帥羣芳。花神一月花朝夕。譜出嬌顏異種良。曾記得，淸室苛求文字獄。那一詩異稱亦稱王。頓時掀起無邊禍。多少書生為此亡。可憐那，死後還須屍暴露。不敎白骨葬墟荒。而今國事蜩　裏。昔日文豪誰憶將。吳梅村，逞詩狂。冲冠一怒為紅妝。到後來，滇王三桂把千金買。未許將詩刪去藏。所以那，淸室皆君把大　猖。一紙通行興文字獄。株連多少好先生。憐他屍骨無人葬。狼籍荒郊在亂崗。牡丹詩。實可傷。那胡兒。逞兇强。竟把文人全禮喪。雲貴英雄淸室叛。也為那，不堪殘忍毒心腸。可憐十字詩詞稿。遽作千秋碧血章。紫牡丹。特別香。綠葉扶疏把美色裝。三月羣花稱第一。要他花國獨稱王。閒幽貞靜好芬芳。</p>

<h3>Song Zheyuan Discusses Meeting with Han Fuju, Temporarily Declines Further Comments on the Current Situation, Hebei-Chahar Diplomacy Currently Stalled, Song Sends Representative to See Chiang to Report on Everything</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Song Zheyuan stated that on the 20th, he met with Han Fuju in Botou Town on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. Subsequently, they traveled together by car to the Yellow River bank. During the journey, they engaged in candid conversations, reaching consensus on approximately three points: First, to appeal for peace and urge the Southwest to cease hostilities. They decided to send a telegram (on the 21st), exhausting all human efforts. Second, to discuss the situation in North China and diplomatic issues. Third, having not met for many days, they took the opportunity to reminisce and reaffirm their friendship. After the telegram calling for a truce is sent, he does not intend to make any further statements. The overall situation in North China is temporarily stable. Diplomatic matters have not been further discussed, as the opinions and positions of both sides remain unchanged after several rounds of talks. Currently, there is no need for further contact. Although Xiao Zhenying has resigned from his positions as Hebei-Chahar Political Commissioner and Chairman of the Economic Committee, he has been urged to remain in those roles. I plan to return to Peiping in two weeks. Whether I will meet with Tashiro and other Japanese figures again in the coming days is still undecided. Song has scheduled a banquet for Tashiro and military staff at his residence on Haihe Road on the evening of the 24th. Invitations have already been sent. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Peiping) After the joint telegram from Song Zheyuan and Han Fuju was issued, diplomatic circles here paid close attention. It is generally believed that this expression is extremely important. It is rumored that the provincial governments of Hebei and Chahar, along with the municipal governments of Peiping and Tianjin, will issue a joint telegram in response. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Han Fuju has decided to travel north from Jinan next week, visiting Song Zheyuan in Tianjin to discuss issues such as the Hebei-Shandong Joint Defense. Han will stay briefly in Tianjin before coming to Peiping to undergo a medical examination at Peking Union Medical College Hospital. If necessary, he will stay in Peiping for a considerable period of recuperation. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Song Zheyuan has sent Zhang Jianhou as his representative to Nanjing to meet with Chiang and report on the situation in North China. No matter how difficult the situation in North China may be, the authorities have resolved to make a strenuous effort to support it. Shandong and Han share the same sentiment. The issue of eastern Hebei cannot be resolved immediately and will not be discussed for now. Discussions will resume when the political situation stabilizes. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Suma Visits Foreign Minister Zhang, No Serious Warning Issued, Tongmeng News Agency Report is Inaccurate</h3>
<p>Nanjing, Tongmeng News Agency dispatch from Nanjing on the 19th stated that the Japanese Consul-General in Nanjing, Suma Yakichiro, visited Foreign Minister Zhang this morning and issued a serious warning, stating that Nanjing was deliberately engaging in malicious propaganda against Japan, falsely accusing Japan of supporting the movement to overthrow the Chinese government. This propaganda must be stopped immediately, etc. According to the spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Secretary Suma of the Japanese Embassy did indeed pay a courtesy call on Foreign Minister Zhang at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 19th after returning from his post, reporting on the whereabouts of Ambassador Kawagoe and requesting our side to approve the date for the presentation of his credentials as soon as possible. Regarding the issue of unusual developments in the Southwest, Suma acknowledged that Japan had indeed sold weapons to the Southwest, but stated that the Japanese government had no misunderstandings about the Southwest and would not show any favoritism. He requested Foreign Minister Zhang's understanding and hoped that discussions between China and Japan would not be affected by this matter. Suma's key points regarding the Southwest were as stated, and there was no so-called serious warning. The details reported by Tongmeng News Agency are entirely fabricated. Furthermore, all parties were quite surprised by the inflammatory remarks made by Suma when he passed through Kobe on his way back to Japan. According to Suma's statement to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the content of his conversation on that day was quite different from what had been reported by foreign news agencies, and it may have been a misunderstanding.

He hoped that the entire country, from top to bottom, would use all its efforts to stop it. Everyone should refrain from buying or selling smuggled goods, which would be effective. After Feng's speech, the ceremony concluded and the meeting adjourned. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held a memorial service at 10:00 AM on the 22nd. Those present included Feng Yuxiang, Deng Jiayan, Jing Tingyi, Cheng Qian, Chen Shaokuan, Chen Shuren, Chen Xunyong, Zhang Yipeng, Lv Chao, Wei Huai, and other officials from the National Government and various ministries and commissions, totaling approximately 500 people. After leading the ceremony, Chairman Lin delivered a speech on "The Importance of Summer Hygiene." He began by saying that the Premier had stated that the oppression our country suffers from the great powers is of three types: population, politics, and economy. The so-called oppression of population means that our country's population has not increased in the past hundred years. The most important reason for the lack of population growth is that our sanitation facilities are far less complete than those of others. Our population has a fast birth rate, but at the same time, it also has a high death rate. As a result, on the one hand, our population will naturally never increase, and on the other hand, the average age of our entire nation will naturally be lowered. This has extremely serious implications for all aspects of the country. Next, he said that the main causes of our country's high population death rate, besides wars and natural disasters, are the spread of epidemics. The spread of epidemics is due to the fact that our people do not pay attention to hygiene. Finally, he stated that summer has arrived, which is a time when infectious diseases are prone to spread. We should pay even more attention to hygiene. Recently, all sectors of the capital have established a Summer Hygiene Organization Movement Committee, and we should wholeheartedly support it, follow the prescribed items, earnestly implement them, and actively advocate for the general public to implement them so that all the people of the country know the importance of hygiene and rise up to implement it. This invisibly adds a lot of strength to the country. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Feng Yuxiang's original speech at the Central Memorial Service on the 22nd was as follows: There is a passage in the Premier's legacy that says, "As the saying goes, a cornered beast will fight. When forced to a point where there is no escape, it should rise up and fight the enemy to the death. We have a great disaster befalling us. Can we fight or not? We must be able to fight." After reading this legacy, what kind of struggle should we engage in during this period of severe national crisis? In the face of the country's situation, what kind of feeling should everyone have in their hearts? Currently, among the various dangerous realities facing the country, the most dangerous is open smuggling, planned smuggling, and the protection of smuggling with guns. Because of the impact of smuggling, our factories have closed down, workers have lost their jobs, and customs revenue has sharply decreased. Some people say, "Smuggling did not start recently; it has existed for a long time." This statement is certainly based on some truth, but we must understand that the current situation of smuggling is vastly different from the past. In the past, the types of smuggled goods were only opium, firearms, and ammunition, and there were no daily necessities. Moreover, it was done secretly. The current smuggling is not only of all kinds of goods but is also blatant and unscrupulous. Everyone has seen in the newspapers what the smuggling situation is like in various places, especially in North China, and how our anti-smuggling personnel are subjected to violence, oppression, and humiliation by smugglers. So, how can the current smuggling be compared to the past? According to the statistics of the Bank of China, last year we lost more than 210 million due to smuggling. Is this figure frightening or not? Because of the large-scale smuggling, more than 80 new smuggling firms have recently opened in Tianjin alone. How alarming is the future danger to us? According to recent customs statistics, from August 11 of last year to April 30 of this year, in nine months, the losses due to smuggling amounted to 26 million. In May of this year, in just three weeks, the losses amounted to 6 million. Assuming that it is calculated at 8 million per month, the annual loss will be 100 million. If we examine the consequences of the disaster of smuggling carefully, industry and commerce will be greatly hit, and the economic foundation will be fundamentally shaken. These are more than enough to bring death to our country and people. This planned smuggling is precisely trying to achieve the aim of destroying our country without spending a single soldier. Therefore, we must pay serious attention to the issue of smuggling. We cherish peace and do not use guns to drive away smuggled goods, but we must let the people of the whole country know the seriousness of this matter and their intentions, and refrain from buying or selling smuggled goods. If we can do this, smuggled goods will naturally have no way to display their skills. This is very feasible, and we must strictly crack down on smuggling so that unscrupulous merchants and traitors have no way to be blinded by profit and act as accomplices. To achieve this goal, we must have all party members take the lead in arousing the public's attention and strictly crack down on smuggling. Then, smuggled goods will naturally disappear.

<h3>The Issue of Defenses in the Dardanelles Strait</h3>
<p>— Lang</p>
<p>The Lausanne Treaty signatory conference opened yesterday in Montreux, Switzerland. The convening of this meeting is specifically to discuss Turkey's proposal to re-establish defenses in the Dardanelles Strait. The Dardanelles Strait is located between Europe and Asia. It leads to the Mediterranean Sea in the front and reaches the Black Sea via the Sea of Marmara, connected to the Bosphorus Strait in the back. It not only forms Turkey's national defense stronghold, but it is also an important side door on the Mediterranean Sea. After the European War, the Lausanne Treaty stipulated that the Dardanelles and Bosphorus Straits, as well as several islands in the Sea of Marmara, were to be demilitarized zones, and naval vessels of all countries could pass freely. This provision not only harmed Turkey's national security but also undermined the integrity of Turkish sovereignty. The Ankara government has long wanted to propose amendments to the signatory countries. In recent years, due to the active expansion of military equipment by various countries preparing for the Second World Colonial Division War, the collective security system has already encountered unprecedented setbacks. Therefore, for the sake of its own security, the Turkish government proposed to the signatory countries on April 11 to re-establish defenses in the Dardanelles Strait.</p>
<p>Turkey's request for re-establishment of defenses is not only a legitimate action of an independent country, but it also conforms to the principle of "change of circumstances" in international law and the provisions of Article 19 of the League of Nations. In principle, no country can refuse it. However, what the future holds for this Montreux conference, we must also examine the attitudes of the relevant countries. The countries most relevant to the issue of establishing defenses in the straits include England, France, Italy, Russia, Japan, Greece, Yugoslavia, Romania, and Bulgaria. Among them, the most important are the four countries of England, France, Italy, and Russia. Before the Great War, England mainly blockaded the Dardanelles Strait, preventing the Russian Black Sea Fleet from sailing into the Mediterranean and threatening England's maritime routes. After the war, England reversed its previous policy and advocated free navigation of the straits because at this time, Russia no longer had a strong fleet to threaten British hegemony in the Mediterranean. Instead, England could use the free passage of the straits to send warships to attack Russia's southeastern border. Based on this observation, England should oppose Turkey's request. However, the international situation has changed greatly in recent years. England's main enemy in the Mediterranean is no longer Russia but Italy. At the same time, the relationship between England and Russia is much improved than it was at the end of the Great War. Therefore, England will not oppose Turkey's request to establish defenses in the straits. Russia will also strongly support Turkey's request. This is because Russia has always supported the liberation movements of small and weak nations, and because the establishment of defenses in the straits will undoubtedly strengthen Russia's first line of national defense. France, Romania and other countries have extremely close relations with Turkey in recent years and will undoubtedly support Turkey's request. The country most dissatisfied with Turkey's request is probably only Italy. Italy has always harbored great territorial ambitions in Asia and Africa. The establishment of defenses in the Turkish straits will certainly hinder Italy's Near East policy. Therefore, it is unlikely to win Italy's approval. However, Italy did not participate in this Montreux Conference because international economic sanctions have not yet been lifted, and most countries support Turkey's request. Italy's attitude is unlikely to have a significant impact.</p>
<p>Judging from the attitudes of the various countries, Turkey's request to establish defenses in the straits is likely to be resolved satisfactorily. The realization of the re-establishment of defenses in the Dardanelles Strait is not only another victory for the liberation movement of small and weak nations, but it is also a major blow to the imperialist ambitions of aggression.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Announces Provisional Regulations for Tax Bureaus, Scheduled to Take Effect on July 1st</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance announced on the 22nd, in the form of ministerial orders, twelve provisional articles for the various district tax bureaus and eighteen provisional articles for the various sub-district tax management offices. The content of the provisional articles for the district tax bureaus states that the Ministry of Finance's Tax Administration is to unify the organization and handle the unified tax, tobacco and alcohol tax, mineral tax, and other commodity taxes to be launched in the future, as well as to conduct spot checks on stamp tax affairs. The country will be divided into several tax districts, and each district will have a district tax bureau, which will be established by the Tax Administration after considering local tax conditions and submitting them to the Ministry of Finance for approval. Provinces without district tax bureaus will temporarily be handled by the original institutions established by the provinces. Next, it is stipulated that each district tax bureau will have one director, appointed to a senior position, and will be under the charge of four sections, and may also establish patrol inspectors, resident factory officers, resident market officers, and resident mine officers. The Tax Administration will submit a request to the Ministry of Finance to establish sub-district tax management offices and tax offices in key areas within its jurisdiction. Finally, it is stipulated that these regulations will take effect on July 1st. The provisional articles for the various sub-district tax management offices stipulate that tax management offices are divided into special grades and grades one, two, three, and four, depending on the amount of tax revenue and the simplicity or complexity of the work. Each office has one director, a specially appointed senior position, and the remaining positions are recommended appointments. The office is divided into sections for handling affairs. It will also take effect on July 1st. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance officially announced on the 22nd that Jing Youyan was appointed as the director of the Hubei-Henan District Tax Bureau, Ding Chunhai was appointed as the director of the Hunan-Jiangxi District Tax Bureau, and Wang Jiashu was appointed as the director of the Sichuan District Tax Bureau. Qu Dacheng and 21 others were appointed as the directors of the Hankou and other district tax management offices.

In addition, Lu Wenlan, director of the Fujian Stamp and Tobacco Tax Bureau, will be reassigned. Huang Yifan, director of the Fujian Saltpeter and Sulphur Bureau, will succeed him, and Chen Liang will be appointed to replace Huang. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance officially announced on the 22nd: "It has been found that the various unified taxes, tobacco and alcohol taxes, and mineral taxes under the jurisdiction of the Tax Administration of this Ministry have been separately established and collected by separate agencies. The organizations are very different, and the command is not uniform, resulting in difficulties in inspection and easy breeding of malpractices. After repeated and thorough rectification, although occasional results have been achieved, there has been a lack of significant achievements. The crux of the matter lies in this. It is difficult to achieve thorough reorganization without fundamental reform. In view of this, this Ministry has drafted a general outline for unifying the tax agencies in various provinces and reforming the local tobacco and alcohol tax methods, which was submitted to the 262nd meeting of the Executive Yuan for deliberation and approval. It should be implemented in accordance with the sequence. This Ministry has determined that the five provinces of Hunan, Jiangxi, Hubei, Henan, and Sichuan will be implemented starting from the 25th year. Hunan and Jiangxi are designated as one district, Hubei and Henan are designated as one district, and Sichuan is designated as one district. In addition to Henan Province, which was originally under the jurisdiction of the Lu-Yu District Unified Tax Bureau, has now been transferred to the jurisdiction of the Hubei-Henan District, the Unified Tax Bureau should be temporarily renamed the Shandong District Unified Tax Bureau. The original unified taxes, tobacco and alcohol taxes, and mineral taxes in the five provinces of Hunan, Jiangxi, Hubei, Henan, and Sichuan under the jurisdiction of each district will be abolished and reorganized, and each district will establish a district tax bureau to specialize in the supervision and collection of matters, and will consider the situation and designate areas in the five provinces to establish sub-district tax management offices and tax offices to specialize in inspection and collection matters. Provisional regulations will be separately formulated by this Ministry and announced for implementation, and will be reported to the Executive Yuan for record. This order is hereby promulgated. Minister Kong Xiangxi." (Central News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)</p>

<h3>Jidong: Smuggling Becomes More Rampant; British Members of Parliament Increasingly Intolerant</h3>
<p>(London) The Chinese government has again requested the attention of the British, American, and French governments to the increasingly rampant smuggling in Jidong. The losses suffered by the customs authorities last month have confirmed the previous estimate of losing one-third of annual tax revenue. According to news from Tokyo, the Japanese government's attitude has not changed much since the British government lodged its protest. British Members of Parliament are becoming increasingly intolerant of the lack of substantial progress in addressing the smuggling situation, especially since Sir Clive, the British Ambassador in Tokyo, raised this issue with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita Hachiro eight weeks ago.

<h3>Sir Frederick Leith-Ross Submits Written Report to British Government; Strongly Advocates China Needs Credit Loans</h3>
<p>(London) Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, who was dispatched to China last autumn to investigate finance and economy and resided in the Far East for nine months, has submitted a written report to the government. He strongly advocates that China needs larger credit loans, including railway loans. He states that since the Chinese government implemented a bold currency reform plan last November, although much effort is still needed, satisfactory results have been achieved, proving the action to be fully justified. As for the Jidong customs revenue, it is of great importance to the country's finances. Recently, the collection of customs duties there has encountered various difficulties. To remedy this, understanding between China and Japan is essential. Furthermore, Sir Frederick believes that China's import trade can gradually and effectively develop. In conclusion, he hopes that the Chinese government will consider revising tariff rates within possible limits. (Havas, 22nd)</p>

<h3>The Truth Behind Nona's Death is Unclear</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After Nona Hutuktu, the Pacification Commissioner of Xikang, passed away in Ganzi on May 12th, there were various rumors circulating. The capital only recently received an official report, but it was vague, only stating that Nona had died of illness in Ganzi. His remains have been taken back by his Secretary-General, Han Dazai, for cremation, and the ashes transported to Kangding. There were no reports regarding his illness or the cause of death. Even the date of death, although said to be May 12th, has not been confirmed. Therefore, the true cause of Nona's death remains a mystery and requires detailed investigation. As for all the aftermath matters, officials and Nona's disciples in Beijing are currently discussing them. (Central News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Inventory of Antiquities Reaches Two-Thirds; Another Half Year Needed to Complete</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The stolen antiquities from the Palace Museum are being actively pursued, and apart from the main culprits, some of the accomplices and lost items have been recovered. The entire case should be solved soon. On the 22nd, a member of the Municipal Government participating in the inventory and supervision of the Palace Museum's antiquities stated that the inventory work has been ongoing for over a year and has now reached two-thirds. Another half year is needed to complete the remaining part. The daily inventory work is still divided into five groups and is being conducted as usual, supervised by the Pingdi District Court, the Public Security Bureau, and the Municipal Government. However, the doors to the places where the items are stored are all locked, some having been closed for one or two years and never opened. The dust accumulation is very thick, and the smell is foul. The personnel working inside every day are greatly affected. Now that it is hot summer, improvements should be made. (Central News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Fujian Province Designates Bandit Suppression Areas; The Third Pacification District Headquarters Moves from Quanzhou to Longyan</h3>
<p>(Fuzhou) The Pacification Commissioner's Office in Fujian has designated Longyan, Yongding, Liancheng, Nanjing, Shanghang, and five other counties as bandit suppression areas to eliminate the remaining bandits in western Fujian, ordering them to be completely suppressed within three months. The Third Pacification District Headquarters moved from Quanzhou to Longyan on the 15th to command operations nearby. After arriving in Longyan, Commander Li Yannian has finalized the suppression plan, and the suppression troops have been fully equipped. They will begin the suppression separately. It is expected that the remaining bandits in the counties of western Fujian can be eliminated as scheduled. However, since Li's troops left Quanzhou for Longyan, bandits and secret society members in Dehua, Datian, and Yongchun are attempting to revive their activities, taking advantage of troop movements to loot everywhere. The provincial military and political authorities have decided to deploy a large force to eliminate them within a specified period or thoroughly investigate whether each group has a background to curb the unrest.

<h3>Guangdong Sugar Loan Becomes a Pipe Dream</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Feng Rui, Director of the Guangdong Department of Agriculture and Forestry, has been running around Beijing and Shanghai for days to negotiate a sugar loan with the financial community. According to sources, the exchange of telegrams between the two parties was already showing promise before Feng left Guangdong. However, the sudden increase in troops by Guangdong and Guangxi on the borders of Hunan, Jiangxi, and Fujian caused strong condemnation from all circles. Leaders of the financial community in Beijing and Shanghai also expressed great dissatisfaction with Guangdong's erratic actions. Therefore, they also refused to negotiate the sugar loan. As a result, Feng's negotiations were entirely fruitless and he was extremely disappointed. Feng told someone last night that when he left northern Guangdong, he heard that Guangdong and Guangxi would automatically withdraw their troops. But after arriving in Beijing, he received a telegram stating that troop increases were continuing. Such inconsistency was completely unexpected. Therefore, he plans to stay in Shanghai temporarily and not return to Guangdong immediately. (Shen Shi News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Progress of Cooperative Loans Handled by the Central Agricultural Bank is Rapid</h3>

<h3>Soviet Russia Proposes Treaty of Non-Aggression to Japan Again; But Japan Still Opposes</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Japan and the Soviet Union have reached a consensus on resolving border incidents, and two committees, one for handling border disputes and one for determining the border, will be established in the eastern border region. Specific negotiations will begin soon in Tokyo. However, the Soviet government still does not give up on its idea of a Russo-Japanese Non-Aggression Pact. When Soviet Ambassador to Japan, Yurenev, visited Prime Minister Hirota the other day, he mentioned this issue, seeking the Japanese government's opinion on concluding a treaty of non-aggression between the two countries. Prime Minister Hirota explained to the Russian ambassador that the Soviet Union was concentrating 200,000 troops on the border, which was a contradiction to proposing a treaty of non-aggression to Japan. He demanded that the Soviet Union reflect on this issue. According to the opinion of officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Russia had not expressed anything to Foreign Minister Arita, but suddenly proposed the issue of concluding a treaty of non-aggression to Prime Minister Hirota the other day. This treaty of non-aggression was proposed by the Russian side when former Foreign Minister Yoshizawa passed through Moscow in 1931, but was rejected by the Japanese government. The Japanese government has not changed its policy on this issue. The Japanese government hopes to first resolve various pending issues between Japan and Russia, so that it can reach a point where a treaty of non-aggression can be concluded. However, there is no reason for the Soviet Union to propose a treaty of non-aggression when it is concentrating 200,000 Red Army troops on the border. If the Soviet Union truly hopes for a treaty of non-aggression, it should first show its sincerity in an appropriate manner. Japan concluding a treaty of non-aggression under the circumstances of both countries' armies facing each other is opposed by national opinion. (Domei, 22nd)</p>

<h3>Japan to Issue Patriotic Stamps; Complete the National Aviation Policy; Can Obtain Three Million Yen</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Communications is currently making every effort to establish a national aviation policy and is continuing to discuss it. It will announce the outline in early July. A huge amount of funding is needed to complete the national policy. If only the government's budget is used, it will be difficult to achieve perfection. Therefore, at this time, it is necessary to seek the cooperation of the entire nation. Therefore, the ministry will issue several patriotic stamps to appeal to the patriotism of the people in order to complete the national policy. At the same time, it will thoroughly instill aviation ideas in the nation. These patriotic stamps will be used for ordinary postal services, so the price will be five sen, replacing the ordinary three-sen stamps, and the remaining two sen will be donated as aviation project funds. It is estimated that three million yen can be obtained after the patriotic stamps are issued two or three times. (Domei, 22nd)</p>
<h3>U.S.-Philippines Economic Conference; Preliminary Budget Meeting to be Held in September</h3>

<h3>Large Armed Arab Group Resists British Troops; Casualties on Both Sides; Many British Aircraft Participate in Combat; Train Attacked Midway; Palestine in a State of Emergency</h3>
<p>Jerusalem: Near Tulkarm, forty miles north of Jerusalem, a large armed Arab group resisted military police today. British aircraft participated in the operation as if in a state of emergency. The two sides fought for several hours. As far as is known, one soldier was killed and three were injured. Ten Arabs were killed, and the number of injured is unknown. This conflict is one of the most serious since the unrest in Palestine. A convoy on its way to Tel Aviv was attacked at noon by seventy Arabs. Scottish soldiers in the convoy immediately engaged in combat. The Seaforth Highlanders garrisoned at Tulkarm rushed to assist upon hearing the alarm. At the same time, four British military aircraft also departed from the area to assist in the battle, which was very effective. After the aircraft arrived on the scene, they divided the Arabs into two groups, one fleeing to a mountain cave to the north, and the other retreating to a mountain cave to the south. Three of the aircraft were hit by gunfire, but all landed safely and transported the more seriously injured British soldiers to the hospital. The British soldiers' activities were not limited to this incident last week. The Seaforth Highlanders surrounded a group of armed Arabs in the Ibhar Mountains near Nablus. One Arab was seriously injured and four were captured. No British soldiers were killed or injured. This group often ambushed the nearby British soldiers' camps in the dark. The Jerusalem water pipe was bombed, and residents in the area were forced to repair the damaged water pipe today. The perpetrators were tracked down by police dogs and lived in the area. At the same time, the authorities have tightened the emergency regulations. Anyone carrying weapons, bombs, ammunition, or incendiary devices will be sentenced to life imprisonment. The Arab Higher Committee has telegraphed Colonial Secretary Gore and the British Parliament, protesting the expulsion of Arab leaders and the demolition of Arab residences in Jaffa. The telegram also firmly denies the claim that the strike by the Arabs of Palestine was funded by any foreign country. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>Jerusalem: A train departing from Jerusalem to the coast today slowed down after rounding a curve and seeing huge stones piled on the tracks ahead. Unexpectedly, a group of Arabs ambushing beside the road also blocked the rear with huge stones. The Arabs then opened fire with rifles at the train and threw bombs. A team of British soldiers guarding the train fired back. The Arabs scattered in all directions. At least five Arabs were killed. One British corporal and one soldier were slightly injured. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Arab Committee Announcement: Continued Strikes and Boycotts; British Authorities Ban Carrying Weapons</h3>
<p>Jerusalem: Following yesterday's armed clash between Arabs and military police near Durkali, the Arab Higher Committee issued a public announcement today, calling on Arabs to continue their strikes and boycotts. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Jerusalem: The situation in Palestine has shown no signs of easing in recent days. A large contingent of armed Arabs engaged in a fierce battle with British military police in the city of Turkalaim, lasting for several hours. The military police used aircraft for support. Initial reports indicated one military police officer killed and three wounded, with two Arabs killed and many wounded. A group of Arab rioters here set fire to a Jewish orphanage. Fortunately, British troops arrived quickly and extinguished the flames. No orphans were killed or injured, and material losses were minimal. In addition, there were reports of Arab ambushes. Some Arab guerrillas ambushed British troops every night near Mount Ebal in the Nablus area, causing considerable distress to the British forces. Today, a battalion of Scottish soldiers discovered the location of the guerrillas and unexpectedly surrounded and captured them all. British authorities today issued new regulations prohibiting all individuals from carrying firearms and explosives, with violators facing life imprisonment. The Arab Higher Committee recently telegraphed the British Parliament and the Colonial Secretary, protesting the actions of the British authorities in Palestine, including the expulsion of several Arab leaders and the demolition of Arab homes. They also stated that rumors of foreign subsidies for the Arab strikes and boycotts were untrue. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>Jerusalem: British troops clashed with Arabs in Nablus today, resulting in the death of one British soldier and ten Arabs. The Arabs initially hid in caves to snipe at the British troops, then retreated into the mountains. The British troops then erected barbed wire to prevent the Arabs from regaining their positions. In addition, a British supply convoy was ambushed in the village of Anni Tai, and three soldiers were injured. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary Declares: Non-Recognition of Italy's Annexation of Abyssinia; House of Commons Discusses Impeachment Motion</h3>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Eden declared in the House of Commons this afternoon that the government will not propose recognition of the annexation of Abyssinia when the League of Nations convenes. The United Kingdom will also not approve any such proposal from other countries. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) Although Labour Party leader Attlee has introduced a motion to impeach the cabinet in the House of Commons, it is expected that the government will not face defeat when the motion is put to a vote. Therefore, the cabinet is not concerned about this matter at present. What concerns them is the loss of prestige among Conservative Party members, which may be difficult to restore. Although members of the party have also expressed support for the abolition of sanctions, they believe that the government did not defend itself well when opposition parties launched fierce attacks during the recent House of Commons debate on foreign policy, leading to complaints. Some people even said that Prime Minister Baldwin does not intend to personally respond to the opposition party's remarks during the next House of Commons debate on the Labour Party's impeachment motion, but plans to ask Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain or Home Secretary Sir John Simon to speak on his behalf. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Situation in Southern Ireland Remains Tense; Army Suppresses Opposition as if Facing a Major Enemy</h3>
<p>Dublin: After the Irish Republican Army, led by opposition leader Tommey, was declared an illegal organization by the Southern Ireland government, it planned to hold a demonstration at the Bodenstown Cemetery. The government strictly prohibited this, and government troops, fully armed, were stationed near the cemetery as if facing a major enemy. Armored vehicles patrolled constantly, and aircraft soared in the sky for reconnaissance. The Republican Army then gathered on the main streets, and many people gave speeches in public, protesting the government's measures. The police dispersed them. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>Dublin: After the Southern Irish Free State government declared the Irish Republican Army an illegal organization, the army leader today called off the planned demonstration at the Bodenstown Church Square. The government has taken strict precautions to prevent any demonstrations from being held there. Five hundred Free State Army soldiers, carrying armed vehicles and aircraft, were stationed there day and night as if facing a major enemy. Civilian patrols also patrolled the nearby streets, intercepting vehicles and questioning them. Except for some women belonging to the Republican Army who briefly demonstrated in the area and were dispersed by the civilian patrol, no other incidents occurred. This morning, several people in Dublin rode in a heavy truck, giving speeches on it, denouncing the government's suppression of the Irish Republican Army. When they drove to the front of the Dublin residence, the police arrested them, but they were released shortly after. The police also arrested several people there and fired shots to disperse a group of demonstrators, but no one was injured. (Reuters, 21st)</p>

<h3>Conservative Democrats in the United States Oppose Roosevelt's New Deal; Five Key Figures Telegraph the Convention; But Insufficient to Affect the Election Situation</h3>
<p>Philadelphia, USA: Five leaders of the Democratic Party's conservative faction today telegraphed the National Convention delegates, requesting that all those attending the opening session here on Tuesday reject President Roosevelt and his New Deal. Among those listed on the telegram were former New York Governor and 1928 Democratic presidential candidate Al Smith, Secretary of State under President Wilson, Colbert, former Senator Reed, former Massachusetts Governor Ely, and New York Democratic leader Guo Xiang. The telegram urged delegates to work together to eliminate President Roosevelt and his New Deal leaders' control over the party. "Otherwise, voters of all parties will know what to choose to preserve the America created by all the great leaders of the past, and delegates must prevent the abuse of the people's money to purchase the president's propaganda." Democratic leaders today are still optimistic about the prospects for the general election campaign and do not believe that President Roosevelt will lose the support of delegates when the convention is held. However, the actions of Smith and others are also noteworthy, as they show that Smith's relationship with President Roosevelt has been completely severed. Democratic National Committee Chairman and Postmaster General Farley claimed that Smith's telegram was expected and that the purpose of these people is known to everyone. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>Philadelphia, USA: The Democratic National Convention is scheduled to be held here on June 23. Today, the party's "old guard" leader Smith has begun to issue orders. Smith has long been rumored to be leaving the party, which is further confirmed by the joint declaration issued today by prominent figures on the right wing: Smith, former Massachusetts Governor Ely, former Senator Reed, former Secretary of State Payne Albright, and former Judge Cochlan. The declaration calls for President Roosevelt to be disregarded and replaced by a pure member of the Democratic Party. "If this is not the case, patriotic voters of all parties will certainly know under which banner they should gather to ensure that America has great leaders as in the past." Those in the business community who signed the declaration have not yet been named. This should not be regarded as a major blow to the party. These people may gather some liberals and stand under President Roosevelt's banner. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<h3>Germany and Danzig</h3>
<p>Potsdam, Germany: The National Socialist Party's National Branch Delegates' Conference was held here today. Propaganda Minister Goebbels attended and delivered a speech, stating: "The German government and people are committed to peace, but they also know that the League of Nations' approach is self-imposed and insufficient to protect peace. Therefore, we have to seek our own way. Take the Italian-Abyssinian dispute as an example, the League of Nations only followed step by step after the sound of the funeral drum, as if sending off a funeral, and at this time, Italian bombers have already solved the Italian-Abyssinian problem. We are afraid that once we are attacked by other countries, we will suffer the same fate, so we have to prepare our own bombers, but this is for the purpose of maintaining peace, and we really do not want to use them for combat." (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>Warsaw: Danzig Free City Council Chairman Greiser delivered a speech at a public gathering today, stating briefly: "The situation in the Free City will soon reach a state of perfect governance, and everyone will be satisfied, and there will never be an opportunity to complain to any court." The right-wing "Warsaw Messenger" commented on this statement, saying that its unspoken meaning is that the City Council is about to violate the Free City's constitution and merge with Germany. The newspaper then quoted Danzig National Socialist Party branch leader Forster as saying, "The security of Danzig will be restored to its original state in less than three weeks," saying that its meaning is quite thought-provoking. In addition, the Danzig National Socialist Party's organ, "The Vanguard," recently published an article in the afternoon, stating briefly: "National Socialist Party members are now sharpening their fists and waiting for the opportunity to move, and the time to launch will not be far away." All these remarks are noteworthy. What's more, according to recent news, the German cruiser Leipzig is also scheduled to arrive at the port of Danzig on the 25th of this month, so the future of the Free City is not optimistic.

<h3>Countries That Signed the Treaty of Lausanne Convene in Switzerland to Discuss the Issue of Restoring Military Equipment in the Turkish Straits; Turkey Puts Forward New Proposals</h3>
<p>Montreux, Switzerland: Representatives of the signatory countries of the Treaty of Lausanne met here this afternoon to discuss the issue of restoring military equipment in the Turkish Straits. The Turkish representative suggested that the limit for foreign warships passing through the Straits should be one cruiser and two destroyers, totaling 14,000 tons, or half the tonnage of the Turkish navy. If the Turkish fleet leaves its base, only one vessel should be allowed to pass through at a time. Fleets from Black Sea countries should also be subject to the same restrictions. However, if one of these countries wants to send a 25,000-ton warship into the Black Sea, it should first obtain permission from the Turkish government. The Italian representative did not attend the meeting. It is expected that Italy will send a representative after the League of Nations cancels the sanctions. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>Montreux, Switzerland: The signatory countries of the Treaty of Lausanne are scheduled to hold a meeting at 4:00 PM today. Representatives from eight countries, including Great Britain, France, Japan, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Greece, Romania, and the Soviet Union, will attend (Italy did not send representatives). The entire Mediterranean issue may be discussed. As far as the general public knows, the Turkish government will submit a new draft agreement to replace the Treaty of Lausanne. The content is nothing more than four items: Turkey may re-fortify the Dardanelles and Bosporus Straits; foreign warships over 14,000 tons are prohibited from passing through the Dardanelles Strait; fleets from non-coastal countries that want to pass through the Straits and enter the Black Sea should be limited to 28,000 tons; Turkish submarines are prohibited from passing through the Straits, and restrictions should also be placed on aircraft flying over the Straits. According to the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923, which Turkey opposes, the north bank of the Dardanelles Strait, which belongs to Europe, must not be fortified, and 12 and a half miles on its south bank, which belongs to Asia, must be designated as a demilitarized zone. The purpose of this treaty is to ensure that, in accordance with "Article 23 of the Treaty of Versailles" (concerning demilitarized zones), ships of all countries can freely pass through the Straits to connect the Mediterranean and Black Sea shipping lanes. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>Montreux, Switzerland: The signatory countries of the Treaty of Lausanne are scheduled to hold a meeting at 4:00 PM today. French representative Former Minister Without Portfolio Peng Gu, British representative Minister of Public Works Lord Stanhope, Soviet representative Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov, Romanian representative Foreign Minister Titulescu, Turkish representative Foreign Minister Rustu, and Yugoslav representative Subotic held preliminary talks this morning to prepare. Well-informed sources believe that the two issues of warships from various countries passing through the Straits and aircraft flying over the Straits will definitely spark heated debates. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>Montreux, Switzerland: The signatory countries of the Treaty of Lausanne are scheduled to meet here today. The representatives of the participating countries are: France is former Minister Without Portfolio Peng Gu, Great Britain is the current Minister of Public Works, former Foreign Minister Lord Stanhope, and Australian Commonwealth Commissioner to the UK Bruce, Turkey is Foreign Minister Rustu, the Soviet Union is Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov, Greece is Ambassador to France Politis, and Bulgaria is Nikolaev. Bruce will be nominated as chairman, and Politis as vice-chairman. According to British sources here, the British government intends to request that discussions be postponed after the opening of the meeting, pending the Extraordinary Congress of the League of Nations passing the abolition of sanctions against Italy this month, so that Italy can also participate in the meeting. At that time, other European issues, such as the Mediterranean issue, can be included on the agenda and discussed together. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>Montreux, Switzerland: The signatory countries of the Treaty of Lausanne are scheduled to meet here today to discuss the issue of restoring fortifications in the Dardanelles and Bosporus Straits.

However, this information has not been confirmed. The meeting is now scheduled to open at 4:00 PM tomorrow. Swiss Federal Government Political Department Minister Mott will attend as the host and deliver the opening speech, and will hold a closed-door meeting on the same day or on Tuesday to formulate the agenda.

<p>Montreux, Switzerland: The signatory countries of the Treaty of Lausanne are scheduled to meet here today. Well-informed sources believe that a misunderstanding has occurred between the Soviet Union and Turkey, the reason being that Turkey may participate in the future Mediterranean Pact, which has caused some concerns in the Soviet Union. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Paris) The famous political commentator Dormaison recently wrote an article in Le Figaro, commenting on the attitudes adopted by various countries at the Montreux Conference, stating briefly: "Greece will follow the lead of Great Britain, Yugoslavia will not object to the demands put forward by Turkey, and Romania will be in a difficult position, because after the Dardanelles and Bosporus Straits are re-fortified, the country will be confined within the Black Sea and will not be able to cross the line. The situation is the same in Bulgaria, and the inconvenience felt by that country, which has not yet joined the Balkan Consultative Group, is even greater than that of Romania. He also said that the crux of the problem at this time is not the re-fortification of the two straits, but the position of Turkey in the Mediterranean dispute. In other words, what will the country do if war breaks out in the Mediterranean? Therefore, what should be discussed at the Montreux Conference is nominally the issue of the straits, but in reality, it is the issue of the balance of power in the Mediterranean." (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Paris Echo recently published an article by the famous reporter Bertina, commenting on the situation at the Montreux Conference, stating briefly: "If an international treaty like the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923 were to be amended in the past, it would inevitably lead to war, but today, the amendment of the Treaty of Lausanne, the Soviet Union, Turkey, Romania, and Greece are acting in unison. The Turkish government's request to re-fortify the Dardanelles and Bosporus Straits will likely be met. However, Bulgaria may take the opportunity to demand access to the Aegean Sea and therefore raise objections. As for Italy, because Turkey, Yugoslavia, and Romania are all Balkan Consultative countries, it may also raise objections. In addition, France and Russia will take the opportunity to hold negotiations with the smaller countries, which is also enough to attract interest, because these smaller countries will definitely try to strengthen the obligations that the major Western European countries should bear towards these smaller countries." (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) The signatory countries of the Treaty of Lausanne are scheduled to hold a meeting in Montreux, Switzerland today. The newspapers have recently commented on this matter, generally saying that Turkey's request to re-fortify the Dardanelles and Bosporus Straits is very legitimate, but the newspapers do not agree on what attitude the United Kingdom will take towards Turkey's request. According to news from correspondents sent by various newspapers to Montreux, the participating countries, because the Italian-Abyssinian War has now ended, intend to take this opportunity to conduct a comprehensive study of the international situation in the Mediterranean.

<h3>Solar Eclipse Observation: Preliminary Results Released</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram from Kamishihoro, Dr. Nishina of the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research, who was in the solar eclipse observation team in Hokkaido, observed cosmic rays and announced the relationship between the solar eclipse and cosmic rays on the 21st. According to Dr. Nishina's announcement, there have been two theories about whether cosmic money is affected by solar eclipses or not. The results of the current observation have proven that cosmic rays are not affected by any solar eclipse, that is, cosmic money is not emitted by the sun, nor is it affected by the sun's action. (Domei News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Most of the solar eclipse observation teams believe that the observation results are satisfactory. The plans set by Soviet astronomers and scientific institutions have been largely completed. A complete explanation of the newly obtained materials will still take more time. Soviet astronomers obtained many photographs of the total eclipse. During the two minutes of the total eclipse, natural phenomena were obviously different from usual. The temperature clearly dropped. In Kamchatka, the solar eclipse caused unexpected phenomena. In Kamchatka, landline communication with the mainland was cut off for two hours, and two radios were ineffective at the same time. In addition to 370 Soviet and foreign astronomers, observatories throughout the Soviet Union observed the solar eclipse. (TASS, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Turmoil Among the French Right Wing: Not Very Serious and Quickly Subdued</h3>
<p>(Paris) After various paramilitary groups were ordered to disband, there was still turmoil in various places last night, but the nature was not very serious and was quickly subdued. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Tonight at 8:00 PM, members of the youth corps affiliated with various groups formed groups near the Place de l'Étoile and in front of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, holding tricolor flags and shouting slogans such as "Long live Colonel de la Rocque, leader of the Croix-de-Feu" and "Down with the Jews" (referring to Prime Minister Léon Blum). They marched along the Champs-Élysées for about half an hour and were dispersed by the police, who arrested several demonstrators but released them shortly after.</p>
<p>The Hard News Agency launched a military band concert to entertain the public in the square in front of the Invalides. The military bands lined up and paraded in the Place de la Concorde at 12:45 PM. More than a thousand spectators in the square shouted slogans such as "France belongs to the French." Several people were arrested. At 3:30 PM, there were thousands of people gathered in the Invalides Square, and four excursion cars, carrying many young people, passed through the square shouting slogans such as "Return France to me," "Down with the Soviet Union," and "Down with the Jews." One of them even shouted "Down with Léon Blum" and "Long live the King." Four people were arrested by the police. Soon after, many people created trouble and shouted "Long live Colonel de la Rocque." The police tried their best to suppress them and arrested fifteen people. Order gradually returned. At around 10:00 AM, in front of the "Italy" subway station, vendors of the royalist newspaper "Action Française" and the communist newspaper "L'Humanité" fought each other. At around 11:00 AM, in the "Feuillade" area, more than fifty members of the Croix-de-Feu clashed with members of the Popular Front's left-wing parties. The police persuaded them to disperse and did not arrest anyone.</p>
<p>Colonel de la Rocque, leader of the Croix-de-Feu, yesterday issued a notice to the people of the country to hang the tricolor flag "to express the permanent existence of French national thought." However, in Paris, except for a few areas where wealthy people live, there were very few people hanging the national flag. As for the provinces, according to reports received by the Ministry of the Interior, the number of counties with flags was also very uneven. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>(Paris) The strike by department store employees in the capital, with all employees occupying the stores, has lasted for half a month today. Now, after Interior Minister Salengro personally mediated, the labor dispute has been resolved. Employees of the "Lafayette" and "Samaritaine" stores withdrew from the stores at noon, and employees of the "Printemps" store held a final meeting at 5:00 PM. The representatives reported the contents of the agreement reached with the employers. In general, the employees cheered and expressed their satisfaction, and then issued an order to withdraw from the stores. Relatives and friends of the strikers, hearing the news, gathered on Boulevard Haussmann to wait. They saw male and female employees coming out one after another, looking happy and singing the "Printemps" song, which was composed by the store employees during the store occupation. The stores are now scheduled to reopen tomorrow, and the central district of Paris will be able to return to its usual prosperous scene. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>(Paris) In the past three days, more than 20,000 striking workers in various industries in the Seine province have resumed work one after another. As of today, the number of strikers nationwide is only 4% of the number during the peak of the labor dispute. (Havas, 21st)</p>

<h3>General Situation of China's National Wealth and International Relations (3)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Qiyun</p>
<p>In the 24th year, the total tonnage of ships entering and leaving China's coastal areas was 10,410,000 tons. Among them, British ships accounted for 42%, Chinese ships accounted for 25%, Japanese ships accounted for 15%, and the rest were the United States, Norway, Germany, the Netherlands, France, Denmark, Portugal, and other countries. The development of highways has been quite rapid in recent years. According to statistics in the 24th year, there are already 90,000 kilometers of highways in the country that are passable by cars. Among them, Guangdong has more than 11,000 kilometers, ranking first in the country, followed by Shandong and Jiangxi with more than 5,000 kilometers each. Others with 2,300 kilometers or more account for more than half of the country. The United States has 48 million kilometers of highways, while China only has 1/400th of that. The United States has one car for every five people on average, the United Kingdom has one car for every 40 people on average, Japan has one car for every 700 people, and China needs 9,000 people to have one car. The gasoline used in our country is all imported, and the import value in recent years is more than 140 million (automobiles and gasoline each account for half). The huge leakage is really shocking. China's civil aviation has three companies: China, Eurasia, and Southwest. The air routes have already exceeded 12,000 kilometers. China Airlines is jointly operated by China and the United States, and Eurasia Airlines is jointly operated by China and Germany, but foreigners only occupy a technical position. Recently, the US Far East Economic Survey Team suggested that the entire US airline establish a trans-Pacific air route, which will shorten the journey from San Francisco to China to four days in the future. In addition, the trans-Eurasian air route from Nanjing via Moscow to Berlin is expected to be reached in only five days. According to statistics from Japan, due to the geographical proximity between China and Japan, the close political and economic relations, and the same culture, postal communication is the most frequent. The total number of postal items received and sent each year is 10 million.</p>
<p>According to the book "China's International Trade Statistics in the Past 65 Years" published by the Academia Sinica, China's international trade ranks 13th in the world, which is not as good as the Netherlands and Belgium. In terms of population ratio, the average trade volume per person is less than three US dollars, which is almost 100 times less than Canada (280 US dollars). China's foreign trade is distributed by region. Before the European War, Central China accounted for one-half, South China accounted for one-quarter, and North China and East China accounted for one-quarter in total. Since the European War, Northeast China has accounted for one-third, Central China has accounted for one-third, and North China and South China have accounted for one-third in total. China's foreign trade is often in deficit, while Northeast China is in surplus. Soybeans, a special product of Northeast China, have always been the largest export commodity in China, which can offset a large part of China's import deficit. The current situation has changed and it is unbearable to recall. According to customs reports, the total value of China's foreign trade in the 24th year was 1.49 billion yuan, of which imports were 920 million yuan and exports were 570 million yuan, resulting in a deficit of 350 million yuan. If the trade value is compared by country, the United Kingdom, Japan, and the United States are the most important, followed by Germany, Russia, and France. Although the status of the United Kingdom itself is behind Japan and the United States, its first position has not been shaken when combined with its colonies. In recent years, a large amount of Indian cotton and Canadian wheat have been imported into China. Hong Kong is a free port, and European goods are transshipped from here, making its position very important. Japan has always ranked first in trade with China (the United Kingdom only counts its own country). After the September 18th Incident, the domestic resistance movement and the disappearance of trade volume in Northeast China have been replaced by the United States. According to the estimation of Professor C.F. Remer of the United States, the capital invested by the powers in China in the 20th year of the Republic of China totaled 3.5 billion yuan (US dollars, including the three northeastern provinces), of which the United Kingdom accounted for 37%, Japan accounted for 35%, and the United States accounted for 6%. The total of these accounts for four-fifths, and the political and economic relations between the three countries and China can be generally seen. Russia's trade with Outer Mongolia and Xinjiang is increasing in importance with each year, but it is not reflected in customs statistics. According to the latest statistics on foreign trade at China's treaty ports in the past 34 years (1900 to 1933) by the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, among the 46 treaty ports in China, the annual trade volume accounts for more than 8% of the total national trade volume, only the five ports of Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, Dalian, and Guangzhou. Shanghai's trade has always accounted for more than half of the total national trade volume. According to statistics in the 24th year, Shanghai accounted for 50% of the total national export value and 55% of the total import value. Try to compare Shanghai with Kobe, Japan. In the 23rd year, Kobe's foreign trade volume was 1.58 billion yuan (accounting for 30% of Japan's total trade volume). In the same year, Shanghai's foreign trade volume was 840 million yuan, which means that Kobe surpasses Shanghai and is the number one commercial port in the East. In the same year, there were more than 9,000 foreigners in Kobe, belonging to 44 countries. There were 63,000 foreigners in Shanghai (including 29,000 Japanese, and 10,000 British and Russian each), belonging to 46 countries. From this point of view, Shanghai can be called the number one international metropolis in the East. From this, it can also be seen that China's foreign trade is still largely in the hands of foreigners.</p>
<p>The above description of China's fundamental strength (human and material resources) has shown its general outline. As for the total amount of China's national wealth, there are currently no accurate figures to point to. According to a survey by the Japanese Cabinet Statistics Bureau, Japan's national wealth is 110 billion yuan. Countries with greater wealth than Japan are the United States (880 billion yuan) and the United Kingdom (290 billion yuan). France and Russia are comparable to Japan, and all other countries are below these countries. The estimation of national wealth is extremely difficult. Whether the above estimates are reliable or not is questionable. China's national wealth is not yet known, and it is even more difficult to compare. However, one thing can also reflect China's poverty and weakness, namely primary education. In the 22nd year of the Republic of China, there were more than 17 million elementary school students in Japan (headquarters), that is, 160 elementary school students per thousand people, and the proportion ranked third in the world (after the United States and Australia). According to statistics in the 21st year of our country, there were 11,720,000 elementary school students in the country (the three northeastern provinces are statistics from the previous year), that is, 27 elementary school students per thousand people, which is six times less than Japan. The loss of children is the result of difficult people's livelihood. This shows that people and the land cannot be isolated, and the land cannot be isolated from people. Production and education are closely related and cannot be separated.</p>

<h3>Conference of Senior Officers of the Japanese Kwantung Army and the North China Garrison Army - Sakagaki Secretly Arrives in Tianjin to Participate, Important Proposals are Divided into Six Items</h3>
<p>Tianjin correspondence, the conference of senior officers jointly held by the Japanese Kwantung Army and the Japanese North China Garrison Army was held in Lüshun on the 18th. To participate in this meeting, Sakagaki Seishiro, Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, took a plane from Jinzhou to Tianjin at 8:30 a.m. on this day. Those who came with him were Konoda, a senior staff officer of the Kwantung Army. Military officers and heads of special service agencies stationed in various parts of North China arrived in Lüshun one day earlier. They gathered at the Japanese Army Headquarters in Haiguang Temple at 9:00 a.m. on this morning. Those present were Japanese Commander Tasiro, Sakagaki, Konoda, and Chief of Staff of the Garrison Army Nagami, Senior Staff Officer Iida, Ishii, Staff Officer Nakai, Lin, Ikeda, Attached Members Matsumuro, Hamada, Senior Adjutant Kawada, Ootake, and heads of various agencies stationed in Yushu Saiki, stationed in Beijing Kazuichi, stationed in Suiha Yosiyama, stationed in Zhang Oomoto, stationed in Tong Yuan Sanyama, Ueno, stationed in Tianjin Matsuoka, etc. In addition, there were military officer Imai stationed in Beiping, military officer Ono stationed in Jinan, military officer Tajiri stationed in Qingdao, etc., a total of more than 40 people. The morning meeting lasted until 12:00 noon for a break, and the afternoon meeting continued at 2:00 p.m. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 p.m. Important proposals include: accelerating the clarification of the Jicha regime; coordinating with the national policy of emphasizing the Sinicization of economic development carried by Ambassador Kawagoe; delimiting the authority of the Kwantung Army and the North China Garrison Army; paying attention to the development of the Southwest Incident, and implementing the military's strategy when necessary; selecting personnel for special organizations and preparing everything in times of emergency; monitoring the actions of the Mayor of Tianjin after he takes office. At 8:00 a.m. on the 19th, senior officials of the two military departments discussed the results of the above-mentioned items in detail to decide on implementation. Military officers and heads of special service agencies in various places have left Tianjin and returned to their posts one after another since the evening of the 18th. Sakagaki's trip to Tianjin was the most secretive. The Japanese military denied his arrival, so it was not known whether he had left Tianjin and returned to Changchun as of the 19th. However, Imai, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, did come to Tianjin from Changchun by plane at 11:00 a.m. on the 19th, accompanied by Staff Officer Hanatani. On the same day, he held a small secret meeting with Tasiro, Nagami, Matsumuro, Iida, and others, stayed in Tianjin for three or four days, went to Tongzhou in Beiping, and then flew to Zhangbei for inspection. He will return to Changchun via Jehol on the 28th. At 2:30 p.m. on the 19th, Ishii, a senior staff officer of the Japanese North China Garrison Army, gave a speech to reporters, saying, "After Chairman Song arrived in Lüshun, he went to Zhang Tuan's residence with Chen Juesheng, Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, at 4:00 p.m. on the 18th to visit Commander Tasiro. This was the first meeting between Tasiro and Zhu since he took office. They talked for about an hour and then left. Diplomatic matters were not discussed in depth because it was the first meeting. Recently, the Jicha Political Council has not sent anyone to contact us on such matters. There is no such thing as Japan continuing to increase troops in North China. According to Hamada, attached to the army in Beiping, he did not deny this, saying that the new team could arrive in mid-July." Beiping plans to increase the current number of people by two times. The troops that came here earlier have no barracks to live in, so they camp along the Beining Railway line. They will leave after the barracks are completed. It is not that troops are being transferred from the country again. At yesterday's (18th) military conference, some people suspected that the Japanese army would have further plans for North China. However, both the former and current commanders are eager for peace and prosperity in North China, and for the people to live and work in peace. Japan has no intention of using troops against North China. This is evidenced by the fact that the military has helped to quell the rebellion of Bai Jianwu last year. Currently, there are many rumors, most of which are fabricated by disgruntled people who collude with rogues and want to take advantage of the opportunity. The military is now paying attention. The authority of the Kwantung Army and the North China Garrison Army is usually bounded by the Great Wall, but sometimes they do not distinguish between regions and adopt close liaison. The Japanese army is directly subordinate to the Emperor, just like an electric light. When the "button" is twisted, the whole thing is bright. Therefore, the Kwantung Army's planes can be dispatched into the Guan by the North China Military Department at any time. The Jidong area is under the responsibility of the North China Military Department. However, if the incident involves diplomacy, the Kwantung Army also has the right to intervene."</p>
<h3>Song and Han Meet at the Border of Hebei and Shandong - One Says Song Returns to Tianjin, Another Says He Goes to Leling, Han Fuju Returns to Jinan on the Same Day</h3>
<p>Tianjin correspondence, Song Zheyuan, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, left Tianjin by special train southward on the 19th to return to his ancestral home in Leling, Shandong Province, to visit relatives. At the same time, Han Fuju, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, also took a special train northward from Jinan at 10:45 p.m. on the same evening after receiving the news. On the 20th, Mr. Song and Mr. Han met at the Botouzhen Railway Station. Then they took the train southward together and stopped at Huangheya Railway Station south of Dezhou in Shandong Province for a rest. Because the station was sultry, Mr. Song and Mr. Han went out of the station to a grove to enjoy the cool air and talked for a long time. Until 5:00 p.m., Mr. Han boarded the train and returned south, arriving in Jinan at 7:00 p.m. As for Mr. Song's whereabouts, one said that he went to his ancestral home in Leling County to visit relatives, and another said that he had returned to Tianjin by the original train.

<h3>Palace Museum Theft Case - Suspect Apprehended</h3>
<p>Guarding Team Soldiers Arrested and Lost Items Recovered</p>
<p>Beiping correspondence, the second theft case was discovered in the Palace Museum in Beiping a few days ago. After strict investigation by the authorities, it is expected that the whole case will be clarified within a few days. According to the announcement of the Palace Museum yesterday, the Public Security Bureau sent personnel to take fingerprints of the soldiers and laborers of each team in the hospital at the beginning of the discovery of this case, and no one was allowed to ask for leave. On the morning of the 19th, Zhao Boyan, a soldier of the Guarding Team, and Zhao Shengfu, a laborer (that is, Zhao Boyan's father), were found not to be working in the hospital. After sending personnel to inquire, it was discovered that the Zhao family and his son had abandoned their homes and fled. On the same day, Zhuang Shangyan, a section chief of the hospital, found paintings and calligraphy by Mian Ning and Na Yanbao at Shuangjuhe Antique Shop at No. 217, Dajie outside the back gate, which matched the register of those stolen this time. He went to the shop on the pretext of buying antique fans. The shop took out two fan faces and one similar one. Then the hospital, together with the district police, went to the shop to search and found three old bone folding fans. The hospital, together with the procurators of the two local courts, sent Zhang Yongquan, the shopkeeper of the shop, Zhang Dechen, the young shopkeeper of Ronghua Zhai, the guarantor of Zhao Boyan, Wang Zhao, Zhao Boyan's sister, and Li Yirong, the shopkeeper of Xicheng Shun Shop, the guarantor of Zhao Shengfu, to the court for interrogation.</p>
<p>On the 20th, Zhuang Shangyan went to inquire around the back gate inside and outside. Pinggu Zhai Antique Shop voluntarily handed over 14 paintings and calligraphy by Mian Ning, Mian Yi, Na Yanbao, Wang Chengpei, and Shen Huan. Li Guangge Antique Shop also voluntarily handed over seven pieces. According to them, these fan faces were all bought from Wang Xu, a resident outside the back gate. Wang Xu was also one of the soldiers of the Palace Guarding Team. He was arrested together with the district police. After a brief interrogation, he confessed to stealing the treasures. According to Wang Xu's confession, when he was on duty in Qianqing Palace two months ago, he asked his companion Zhao Boyan to guard him while he went to the toilet. When he returned, he saw Zhao walking out from behind the throne. After questioning, he responded vaguely and said that he wanted to report it. Zhao then confessed to stealing the treasures, repeatedly begged Wang to be tolerant, and asked Wang to go to Zhao's house after get off work. Zhao gave Wang an enamel watch, a painting core, and eight fans. When Wang took it home, Wang's mother ordered him to return it or sell it quickly. Wang sold the watch to Cheng Xingyun Antique Shop outside the back gate and got 21 yuan. He sold the fans to Pinggu Zhai and got 23 yuan. The painting core (that is, Zhao Ziang's Painting Horse) was also sold to Cheng Xingyun for one yuan.</p>
<p>On the 21st, Liu, Zhao Boyan's wife, was arrested on Di'anmen Street. According to her confession, Zhao Shengfu, my father-in-law, said yesterday, you should quickly find your husband and run away. My husband, Zhao Boyan, was either inside Deshengmen. I went into the city to find him, but I couldn't find him. After I went home, he and his son had already fled. According to Qi Changshuo, a shop assistant at Pinggu Zhai, the seller of antiques was surnamed Wang, wearing leather shoes and a Serge coat. When he came to sell for the second time, there was still a painting core that he didn't buy. According to the shop assistant of Li Guangge, the seller of antiques was surnamed Wang, in his twenties. Zhao Ziang's Painting Horse had three horses and two people. Because it was a rough silk ground, he didn't want it. According to people involved, the antiques stolen from the Palace Museum this time also include treasures such as white jade cabbage, jade coral, and large and small Ruyi. These are all guarded by police officers on patrol in turns, and it is quite difficult to steal them. This theft may have occurred when wearing leather cotton clothes in winter and spring, and they were carried out in their arms. Currently, the Palace Museum and the court are still conducting strict investigations separately, and they are trying to find out the truth of the whole case within a few days. (21st)</p>
<h3>Liu Guitang Assassinated in Tianjin - Three Bullets in the Head and Chest, Not Dead, the Reason for the Assassination Has Not Been Determined</h3>
<p>Tianjin correspondence, since last winter and this spring, Liu Guitang gathered more than 2,000 bandits Wang Hanru, Wang Daoyi, Zhang Haijiao, etc., and went south from the Changcheng Line in Chahar, following the old path of the 23rd year, wanting to return to the junction of Henan, Shandong, and Hebei to occupy. After being intercepted and defeated by the garrisons, most of them returned to Siyihaiye and Yongning Fort in eastern Chahar, under the command of Wang Daoyi. They were recruited and reorganized into security teams by the Chahar Provincial Government. However, because they were difficult to tame, they fought with the security teams Feng Shoupeng and Luo Zi's troops a month ago and were resolved by the joint efforts of Feng and Luo. The remaining troops were led by Li Ziying and fled outside the Great Wall, collapsing along the border wall and joining forces with Zhang Haijiao's scattered bandits. They roamed along the various passes of the Great Wall. Liu himself escaped to Tianjin from eastern Shandong in early spring and hid in a rented house in Gengyuli 1, Akashi Street, Japanese Concession. Many of his old subordinates lived with him. Because Liu was unwilling to be lonely, he has been trying to rise again for several months. Recently, because the situation in North China is bad, all the disgruntled warlords and politicians are thinking of moving. Liu then united with a certain inspector and a certain commander-in-chief, wanting to gather his diehards to rebel. His chief of staff, Jin Huanwen, was also ordered to go to the Malan Pass area to contact Zhang Haijiao and others, intending to wait for the opportunity to act. At 10:20 p.m. on the 20th, two people suddenly came to Liu's residence and knocked on the door. The gatekeeper of Liu's residence opened the door and came out to see. The two people claimed to be Liu's subordinates. The gatekeeper found that one of them seemed to be surnamed Zhang, who had served as a regimental commander in Sun Chuanfang's army and often came to Liu's residence to visit Liu and talk. Although he did not know the name of the other person, he also felt that his face was familiar. He immediately invited them into the gatehouse and asked them to wait. The gatehouse was the south room downstairs, and Liu's subordinates lived downstairs in the north, with several people playing mahjong. Liu himself came downstairs to sit and watch. The two people who claimed to be Liu's subordinates did not wait for permission and broke into the north downstairs, drew their guns and fired six or seven shots at Liu. Three bullets hit Liu's left chest near the armpit, and all the bullets went through. One bullet hit Liu's left lower jaw and went through his right cheek. A servant of his was also hit in the waist by a bullet. They both fell to the ground. After the two attackers succeeded, they took advantage of the crowd's panic and jumped over the short wall to escape, running through the alley after Gengyuli and rushing to the corner of Suma Street to board a car that was waiting there. When Liu's family saw something happen, they immediately reported to the Japanese police station. Immediately, Ikeue, the captain of the Japanese gendarmerie detachment, and Oowa, the director of the Judicial Department of the police station, led the military police to the investigation. The entire Japanese Concession was immediately under alert. Akashi, Fukushima, and Suma Streets were temporarily cut off from traffic to search for the criminals, but nothing was found. Liu and the servant were carried to the Gongwen Hospital for treatment. That night, they could not speak due to excessive bleeding. The servant was only slightly injured and was fine. On the morning of the 21st, Liu fainted once. Later, he was resuscitated with a cardiac stimulant injection. Around noon, Oowa, the director of the Japanese police station, went to the hospital to investigate. Liu was already able to speak. The treatment was progressing well. According to reports, the reason for the assassination is still unclear. However, a servant surnamed Xu in his entourage disappeared after the incident. It is suspected that he was bought by someone and colluded with foreigners to carry out the assassination. Gongli Hospital determined that Liu needed to rest for two months before he could recover. The Japanese police station and the gendarmerie detachment did not withdraw the alert on Akashi Street on the 21st and were still searching for the criminals. After this incident occurred, all those with ambitions and plans to act have rushed to a certain party since the night of the 20th to beg for protection in order to prevent accidents. (21st)</p>
<h3>New Appointed Chairman of Chahar Province, Liu Ruming, Arrives in Zhangjiakou to Assume Office</h3>
<p>Guo Zhihan Represents Song to Oversee the Handover, Liu Proposes Four Points for Self-Encouragement</p>
<p>Zhangjiakou Correspondence: The newly appointed Acting Chairman of the Chahar Provincial Government, Liu Ruming, arrived in Zhangjiakou from Beiping on the 20th. At 10:00 AM on the 21st, the inauguration ceremony was held. Attendees included Guo Zhihan, representative of the Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Commission; Yao Jingchuan, Commander of the Second Cavalry Brigade; representatives from various departments, commissions, organizations, and groups; Nakané, the Japanese Consul-General stationed in Zhangjiakou; and Oomoto, Chief of the Special Affairs Agency; totaling over 300 people. After the meeting began, the entire assembly bowed three times to the Party flag, the national flag, and the portrait of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and sang the Party song. First, the outgoing Chairman Zhang Zizhong, represented by Yang Zhaogeng, gave an account and a speech, briefly stating that Chairman Zhang had been transferred to head Tianjin Municipality, and because he had just taken office and was busy with duties, he could not come to Zhangjiakou in person, so he sent him as a representative to handle all handover matters. After Yang finished speaking, the seal handover ceremony was held. Then, Guo Zhihan delivered an instructional speech, briefly stating, "Today is the day Chairman Liu assumes office as acting chairman. I am very honored to be here on behalf of Chairman Song. Everyone knows that Chairman Liu has made outstanding achievements in the past and has made great contributions in politics and is greatly concerned about national affairs. Liu himself has been stationed in Chahar Province for a long time and is very familiar with the situation in Chahar. This time, Chairman Song specially appointed him to act as Chairman of Chahar Province, which is certainly a pleasant and competent appointment. I hope for three things in actively building and stabilizing the people: First, Chahar is in a state of decay after years of chaos. In the future, we should act in accordance with the principle of pleasing the people and eliminating what they dislike, so that the people can be stable and the local area can be prosperous. Second, uphold integrity. This is what officials must abide by, and it is even more necessary in a turbulent national state. In the future, we should act positively in accordance with the two words 'integrity' to realize a clean and honest provincial government. Third, value diplomatic relations. Chahar Province, under the current circumstances, should abide by the national government's order of good neighborliness and work with sincerity and courtesy on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, and embark on the path of peace." After Guo finished speaking, Liu Ruming gave a response, briefly stating, "Distinguished guests, comrades, I have been ordered to concurrently serve as acting Chairman of Chahar Province. Today I am assuming office, and I am deeply honored by the warm participation of Director Guo sent by Chairman Song and all the guests. I have been serving in the military and am not very familiar with local conditions. I am afraid that I will not be able to fulfill this role. I can only follow the instructions of Chairman Song, the established rules of former Chairman Zhang, and the efforts of all my colleagues to move forward, perhaps achieving some results within the scope of possibility. Now, I have four points for self-encouragement in political affairs: First, to defend public security, I will vow to supervise the military and police and work hard to suppress bandits, stabilize the local area, and let the people live and work in peace. Second, to strive to fulfill my responsibilities, follow the achievements of Chairman Zhang in the past, lead civil servants to eliminate malpractices, and actively move towards the right track. Third, to strictly prohibit the Communist bandits. The Communist bandits kill and set fires everywhere, spreading misfortune to young people, and there is a great hidden danger. In the future, the Chahar Provincial Government must strictly ban them to ensure that no bandits are found within the territory, so as not to endanger the foundation of the country. Fourth, to abide by the central government's repeated orders of good neighborliness and implement good diplomatic relations. The Chahar Provincial Government will adhere to this purpose and work sincerely to maintain peace in East Asia. These four points are relatively major, so they are specifically put forward. There are also many other common situations, which must be handled according to local conditions. I hope that you will provide corrections at any time, which is what I hope for." After Liu finished his response, photos were taken and the ceremony was announced complete. It was half-past ten. For the sake of camaraderie, Liu hosted a banquet for Guo Zhihan and the heads of various departments in the provincial government at 11:00 AM, which lasted until noon before everyone happily dispersed.</p>
<p>After assuming office, Liu Ruming told reporters, "The original Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, Ma Yanchong, has gone to Tianjin to take office with former Chairman Zhang. I have submitted a recommendation to the Political Affairs Committee for the successor, which will be officially announced in a few days. The various departments and offices of the Provincial Government will take over this afternoon (the 21st), and there will be no major changes in personnel. I will go to Beiping around the 24th, then go to Tianjin to meet Chairman Song, report on the inauguration, and make some requests." (21st)</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Water Patrol Team Captures Suspect in Kidnapping Case</h3>
<p>Huang Shiyuan, a villager from Xiangze Township, Sijing, had his 14-year-old son, Guilong, kidnapped four days ago, and there was no information about him. Later, Guilong suddenly escaped from the kidnappers' watch and returned home. The kidnappers have not yet been caught. Last night, Tang Shuqin, the No. 2 police officer of the Water Patrol Team, learned that a suspect in the case, Sheng Guilin, was eating in a small restaurant in Miaoyan Temple, and immediately arrested him. During the interrogation, he hesitated and denied everything, only confessing that Jin Ahai and others from Louxia, Qingpu, were related to the kidnapping case. That night, Tang led the police to Louxia, and Sheng Guilin identified Jin Ahai, who was arrested and taken back for further investigation in order to arrest the remaining accomplices.</p>
<h3>Nanhui: Suspicious Peddler Detained</h3>
<p>Recently, strange-acting people have been found in various places, copying down store names while peddling items such as writing brushes along the streets. Two people came to this city yesterday. After investigation by the Public Security Bureau, they were taken in for questioning. According to their statements, one was Xu Busheng and the other was Shi Jun, both from Yixing. Xu graduated from Renhe Hospital in Shanghai and is a member of the Chinese Red Cross Society. He currently lives on Handley Road in the Shanghai International Settlement. He had previously come to this county to peddle writing brushes for a week. This time, he brought more than 300 writing brushes and dozens of bottles of cross oil with Xu Busheng, whom he met when he was unemployed, to sell in the south, and claimed to be a member of the Oriental Service Society. However, the society has already closed down, and they are still using its name to attract business. However, it was observed that the writing brushes and cross oil they carried were all dirty and old, and did not look like items for sale. Moreover, two notebooks full of copied store names were found on them. When asked why they copied them, they hesitated and did not give a clear answer. They are highly suspicious, so they have been placed under surveillance and reported to the county government for verification.</p>

<p>The newly appointed Japanese Ambassador to China, Shigeru Kawagoe, along with his wife and secretary Hoshida, arrived in China aboard the Asama Maru to assume his new post. The ship was delayed due to encountering a storm en route and did not arrive at the Huishan Wharf until 2:40 PM. The wharf area was guarded by armed police officers dispatched by the Public Concession Police Department and the Japanese Embassy Police Department. Chinese and Japanese individuals who came to the port to welcome him included Zhou Jue and his wife, director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai office; Wang Changchun, representing Mayor Wu Tiecheng; Xu Xiuzhi, former Vice Minister of the Interior and friend of Ambassador Kawagoe; banker Zhou Zuomin; journalists Hu Zhengzhi and Zhang Jiluan; and from the Japanese side, Minister Wakasugi Kaname of the Embassy; Naval Attaché Sato, Lieutenant General, and Attaché Okino; Army Attaché Kiita, Major General, and Attaché Utsunomiya; Counselors Arino, Horiuchi, and Honno; and all personnel from the Japanese Embassy and Consulate General; and Gan'nou, Chairman of the Japanese Residents' Association, Miri, and over a hundred others. Ambassador Kawagoe shook hands with each of the Chinese and Japanese welcomers and then met with the Chinese and foreign press aboard the ship before taking a car to the ambassadorial residence on Bisson Road to rest.</p>
<p>Written Statement</p>
<p>When Ambassador Kawagoe arrived in Shanghai, he issued a statement in Chinese, English, and Japanese, saying, "I feel a great responsibility to come to China this time on assignment. Fortunately, like my predecessors, Ambassadors Arita and Ariyoshi, I have been involved in matters related to China both domestically and internationally for quite some time, and I have many friends in the north and south of China. Therefore, I intend to rely on the strength of these old friends and acquaintances in order to do my best to open up relations between China and Japan. The current difficulties facing China are complex and diverse, among which the development of the national economy is particularly urgent. Japan sincerely hopes to cooperate with China in developing its economy. Needless to say, I intend to rely on the aforementioned cooperation between China and Japan to strengthen the ties between the people of the two countries, to promote good neighborly relations between the two countries, and to ensure peace in East Asia. I sincerely hope that all parties will provide assistance to me so that I can accomplish my mission."</p>
<p>Appearance and Demeanor</p>
<p>Ambassador Kawagoe is 56 years old. He graduated from Tokyo Imperial University and served in the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where he was successively assigned to the Japanese Embassy in Germany and other places. He was transferred to serve as Consul General in Qingdao, Guangzhou, Jilin, Tianjin, and other places. He has been in China for more than ten years. After former Ambassador to China Arita was promoted to Foreign Minister, Kawagoe was promoted from Consul General in Tianjin to Ambassador to China. When Kawagoe arrived in Shanghai yesterday, he was wearing a gray suit and black leather shoes. His hair was slightly graying, but he looked energetic. His wife was of a similar age and interacted with the Chinese and Japanese welcomers with a generous demeanor.</p>
<p>Date of Trip to Nanjing</p>
<p>According to Arino, a counselor at the Japanese Embassy, who spoke to a Central News Agency reporter aboard the ship, the new ambassador will meet with Japanese expatriates in Shanghai and personnel from the embassy and consulates after arriving in Shanghai, and the date of his trip to Nanjing to present his credentials has not yet been officially announced, so it has not been decided. However, it is already being discussed and is scheduled for 11:00 AM on the 30th of this month. If it is confirmed, the ambassador will enter Nanjing on the evening of the 28th and first meet with Foreign Minister Zhang. Regarding the question of the embassy's relocation to the south, since an office has been established in the capital, the ambassador will be permanently stationed in Nanjing and Shanghai, and it seems that it can be postponed. Shanghai news on the 22nd from the League of Nations stated that Ambassador Kawagoe, who arrived in Shanghai today, will begin tomorrow to receive reports on the local situation from Councilor Wakasugi, Consul General Suma in Nanjing, and the military and naval attachés, and will also convey the central government's policy. He is scheduled to depart Shanghai on the 28th with the military and naval attachés and embassy staff, arrive in Nanjing on the 29th, and present his credentials on the 30th.</p>

<h3>Feng Rui Still Lingering in Shanghai, Denies Being Recalled to Guangdong</h3>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, Hong Kong newspapers reported that the Guangdong authorities sent an urgent telegram to Feng Rui on the 20th, summoning him back to Guangdong. Mr. Feng solemnly denied this to the New Voice News Agency reporter, stating that he had not received such a telegram. The authorities are hoping he will complete all the negotiations before returning. Why would they urgently recall him? He is still in negotiations with the Ministry of Finance and banking circles. If these matters are completed within two or three days, he will return south immediately. Rumors that the situation is becoming tense are exaggerated, he said.</p>
<h3>Sir Otto Niemeyer's Farewell Remarks: Hosted Journalists Yesterday Afternoon, Departing China by Ship Today</h3>
<p>Sir Otto Niemeyer, the British economic advisor, came to China last autumn and visited Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangdong, Wuhan, and other places to investigate China's economic situation. He also visited Japan again at the end of last month to meet with Japanese authorities and exchange views. He returned to Shanghai a few days ago and will depart China today at 4 PM on the British Company's *Rempura* with his wife and assistant, Messrs. Paget and Rogers. Sir Otto visited Minister of Finance Kong yesterday to say goodbye and met with journalists at the Cathay Hotel at 4 PM to deliver the following remarks:</p>
<p>The British government sent me to investigate China's financial and economic difficulties and the possibility of our allied powers assisting China in overcoming these difficulties. I have been in China for almost nine months and have diligently and humbly investigated the situation in China. A large portion of my time, due to practical needs, was spent in Shanghai, but I also traveled to Nanjing, Tianjin, Beijing, Hankou, Chongqing, Xiamen, and Guangzhou, and met with representatives of the government authorities and banking and business circles in various places. The British government originally hoped that the United States, Japan, and France would each send experts to cooperate with me, but this did not materialize. However, the United States recently sent an important economic survey mission to China, and I have read their report with great interest. I have been in contact with representatives of the Japanese government and bankers in Shanghai and have traveled to Tokyo twice to gain a clear understanding of the Japanese government's views. My detailed report on this trip will be submitted to my government in the future. However, it would be beneficial to briefly describe my impressions before leaving China. The first problem I noticed was, of course, the position of currency. Silver has been China's currency for many centuries. In 1934, the sudden surge in silver prices caused the exchange rate of China's currency to rise accordingly. Compared to world prices, Chinese products became very expensive, leading to a decrease in exports. China had to export silver to offset the unfavorable balance of international trade. As a result, credit declined, forming a deflationary trend. Domestic prices fell, creditors could not recover debts, and banks stored silver in their vaults without being able to use it. The decline of the Shanghai real estate industry further aggravated the situation. In October 1934, the Chinese government, recognizing the severity of the crisis, issued an order to levy an export tax on silver. As a result, the Shanghai silver dollar became isolated from the free silver standard. However, while this measure was sufficient to reduce the extreme impact of rising silver prices, it still failed to eliminate the underlying difficulties. When I arrived in Shanghai last September, it was necessary to take more positive steps. China was abandoning the silver standard at this time, but had not adopted another monetary system. My arrival in China did not bring any definite plan to invite the Chinese government to adopt, because at that time there was more than one way to adopt, and the decision of which to choose was greatly related to the psychology of the Chinese people. At that time, only the Chinese government could decide. At that time, I examined the monetary situation and drafted a detailed plan to ensure safety as the main requirement. If possible, I also sought international assistance. However, before this plan was completed, the exchange rate became weaker and weaker, and the government had to adopt the legal tender control policy based on its own strength. I am not responsible for this bold step, but the success of this policy shows that it is indeed beneficial. After the new currency was issued, it was circulated throughout the country without much difficulty. The legal tender issued by the government bank gradually replaced the silver dollar in the market, and its exchange rate remained fixed. At the same time, the government's ability to maintain this exchange rate also increased sufficiently. The exchange rate set by the government promoted exports on the one hand, and the increase in agricultural prices on the other hand, the purchasing power of farmers also improved. The unfavorable balance of international trade was greatly reduced, and the balance of international payments has been achieved. Therefore, the basic economic needs for consolidating the currency have been successful. I think the progress of the Chinese government's monetary policy is indeed worth celebrating. The Chinese government has achieved a lot of success in financial and economic recovery. The people's faith in currency is becoming increasingly solid, but in order to obtain a reliable basis for long-term trade and investment plans, it is still necessary to succeed in other steps. Because the government's implementation of new policies did not have a long-term announcement in advance, the various steps had to be implemented one by one. If the unified issuance of legal tender and the reorganization of the central bank have not been implemented yet, non-commercial speculative behavior will also make people feel uneasy. The government's budget is in deficit and borrowing is unavoidable. The domestic debt market is weak and sluggish, and the government's credit is also weak. Although the financial market is now more relaxed, many commercial banks have still failed to be active. In addition, the political difficulties in North China and South China, and the recent plunge in silver prices after the United States stopped buying silver in the world market, are all points of difficulty. However, on the whole, if the Chinese government can complete its domestic improvement plan, especially focusing on the reorganization of the central bank and the reform of the budget, then it can be completely trusted in the economic aspect. The future of China's currency and even the entire financial position in the future must first depend on the maintenance of domestic security in China, and second, must be based on the resolution of the special situation in North China. China's customs duties are most concerned in finance. Therefore, the difficulties in tax collection in eastern Hebei should be urgently sought for decision-making. However, if you want to solve this difficulty, you must first seek political understanding between China and Japan to be successful. When I was in Tokyo, the Japanese authorities stated that Japan also hoped for this understanding, advocating the integrity of China's tax administration, never supporting local authorities to split the customs administration or establish independent tax regulations, and even less willing to interfere in China's internal affairs. Therefore, I sincerely hope that the current difficulties can be resolved to restore general trust and promote investment and trade activities. I pay close attention to the issue of currency, because the consolidation of finance is the basis of trade. If the exchange rate fluctuates, credit will be tightened and trade will be difficult. However, after the currency is consolidated, other aspects should be used to promote exports. Plans, such as reducing domestic tax rates, improving the quality of goods, and improving management and design, etc. However, it seems that China's natural exports should be controlled to a lesser extent. As for imports, there will be no immediate progress, because the progress of the import industry is a prerequisite for the progress of the export industry. I hope that when the opportunity comes in the future, British exporters will be able to take advantage of the opportunity to seek development. More importantly, the rise and fall of the import industry depends on the level of tax rates. I hope the Chinese government can consider the point that we can still reduce tax rates without reducing tax revenue. Recently, some tax rates are too high. As a result, they only make importers wait and see, and tax revenues also suffer losses. I think the setting of tax rules should be revised with the current exchange rate as the standard. In terms of industry, it is hoped that the high tax rate will be maintained, but for farmers, the high import tax is really afraid that it will be harmful and unprofitable. Therefore, the government's responsibility is to make both parties reach a balance, and from the current situation, it is more important to restore Chinese agriculture than to revitalize industry. Therefore, in my personal opinion, if the import tax rate can be reduced, it will be beneficial to China in both financial and economic terms. China's development depends heavily on the import of some important goods. This is probably the most promising point for British exporters. In the past, Britain provided a lot of assistance to China's railways. Unfortunately, China's debt credit has not been repaid as scheduled, resulting in failure to obtain new loans. Now the Chinese government is determined to repay old debts to the extent of its financial capacity, and has also made many improvements in railway management. Therefore, after the old debts are resolved, it can proceed to develop China's railway network, so that China's vast areas can trade with foreign countries, which is most mutually beneficial to China and Britain. In addition to the long-term credit required for railway construction, attention should be paid to the methods of obtaining medium-term credit at this time. This type of credit is especially beneficial to the operation of public utilities. During my months in China, I deeply admired the efforts of municipal authorities in various places in municipal construction. I think British manufacturers and exporters should consult with banks and relevant government departments operating in China to assist in the implementation of reliable plans. There are also many opportunities for private capital investment in China. However, in order to attract investors' attention, discrimination against foreign investment should be eliminated to deepen foreigners' confidence. In terms of real estate, it should be fully guaranteed in terms of mortgage rights. If it is treated unfairly, foreign investment will definitely not be able to help China. I fully agree with the American Economic Survey Mission's statement that China is currently undergoing a huge change. I believe that the result of this change will make China a more effective place for British commercial, industrial and financial operations. The main concern of Britain to China is to increase China's prosperity and trade, and to maintain its peace. If we work hard on this, the beneficiaries will not only be Britain, but also countries around the world that trade with China. China's construction is intricate, and our country wants to help, and we can do our best everywhere. Although the Chinese government is in the midst of hardships, it has made amazing progress in developing transportation, revitalizing rural areas, and restoring safety and order. The recent currency reform is especially well-managed, and its success will benefit everyone. Finally, before the end, I would like to express my deep gratitude on behalf of my colleagues to the Chinese government and Chinese and foreign banks and businessmen for the assistance they have given us.</p>

<h3>The National Products Preservation Association Petitions for the Announcement of the Abolition of the Boxer Protocol</h3>
<p>The Chinese National Products Preservation Association yesterday submitted a petition to the National Government's Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting the announcement of the abolition of the Boxer Protocol to maintain security in North China. The original text reads: To Chairman Lin of the Nanjing National Government, President Jiang of the Executive Yuan, and Minister Zhang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as reported, Japan is using the Boxer Protocol as an excuse to increase its troops in North China for no reason. Its ulterior motives are obvious. According to the main purpose of the Boxer Protocol, one is to compensate various countries for military expenses, and the other is to maintain transportation in Tianjin and protect embassies. Therefore, various countries are allowed to station troops in appropriate sections. Today, as times have changed, the above two items have completely failed in fact. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, countries that have strengthened friendly relations have all returned the Boxer Indemnity. This means that the agreement has failed and should be announced for abolition. First, our government has established its capital in Nanjing. Ambassadors and ministers from various friendly countries have all moved south with the capital for convenience, or have chosen to work in Beijing and Shanghai. In reality, the embassy in Beijing is only a part of the building. This means that the agreement has failed and should be announced for abolition. Secondly, in order to maintain sovereignty and prevent disputes, the Association dares to make a bold request and send a special telegram. We respectfully request that your government, the Yuan, and the Ministry quickly abolish the Boxer Protocol in accordance with the facts, and inform the friendly countries listed in the agreement in order to maintain sovereignty and prevent excuses. We await your orders with trepidation. The Standing Committee of the Chinese National Products Preservation Association, Wang Jie'an, Wang Xingyi, and Wang Hanqi, respectfully kowtow.</p>
<h3>National Products Movement Promotion Week Begins Promotion Yesterday</h3>
<p>The opening ceremony was held in the afternoon, demonstrating fire extinguishers. A lantern parade was held in the evening to promote the use of national products.</p>
<p>The Citizens' National Products Year Sports Meeting was held at the Penglai Road Market yesterday afternoon at 2 PM for the National Products Movement Mobilization Promotion Week. Zhu Yangwu from the Municipal Party Department, Zhang Yizuo from the Citizens' National Products Year Association, Cao Zhigong from the First Special District Citizens' Federation, Liu Zhongying from the National Products Manufacturers' Federation, and more than 500 guests and representatives from various factories attended. First, Chairman Zhang Yichen reported, stating briefly that this year is the Citizens' National Products Year. In order to implement the purpose of promoting national products, in addition to holding this National Exhibition, a National Products Mobilization Promotion Week was held to arouse the minds of citizens throughout the city to use national products consistently. Currently, the way to save the country is only to promote national products, and there is no other appropriate way. I hope that the guests attending the meeting will share this purpose, spread the word, and provide more assistance, so as to achieve twice the result with half the effort, he said. Then, Liu Zhongying gave a speech, omitting the details.</p>
<p>Fire Extinguishing Demonstration At 4 PM, the Puqiu Industrial Company demonstrated fire extinguishers and fire extinguishing bombs in Penglai Garden. A wooden house was built in the field. First, flammable materials were sprinkled, and then the fire was lit. The demonstration included: 1. Shooting power test of chemical fire extinguisher; 2. Shooting power test of foam fire extinguisher; 3. Foam volume expansion test; Wood frame fire test; 5. Oil pool fire; 6. Wood house fire. Among them, the foam fire extinguisher was the most effective. When the wooden house was on fire, the fire extinguishing bomb was tested. After three bombs were thrown, the fire remained. It was still extinguished by the foam fire extinguisher. Compared with the performers of the Da Zhong last year, it was much inferior.</p>
<p>Lantern Parade The manufacturers of the National Exhibition also held a lantern parade at 6 PM. More than 100 factories and more than 1,000 lanterns participated. First, they set off from Penglai Road and walked along Zhonghua Road, Xiaoximen, Dananmen, Xiaonanmen, Dadongmen, Xiaodongmen, Renminguo Road, Xinkaihe, Laobeimen, Xinbeimen, Xinqiaojie, Fangbang Bridge, Ximen, and then to Penglai Road to disband. The crowd along the way was blocked.</p>
<p>Promotional Program The National Products Promotion Mobilization opened yesterday and will last until the 28th. The program today is the National Products Factory Promotion Day.

<h3>Agricultural Banking Syndicate Allocates One Million Yuan</h3>
<p>To Establish Warehouse Loans in Anhui Province</p>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, the China Agricultural Cooperative Loan Syndicate achieved good results in providing rural loans in various places last year. The syndicate has decided on the loan methods for this year, including 250,000 yuan for Hebei production loans, 250,000 yuan for Shaanxi production loans, 500,000 yuan each for Hebei and Shaanxi transportation and sales loans, and 1 million yuan for Anhui warehouse loans. Regarding the Anhui warehouse loans, the syndicate is actively proceeding. The Anhui Provincial Government has sent Secretary Hu Shiqi to Shanghai to contact the person in charge of the syndicate to negotiate the draft contract and loan procedures. It is learned that the contract has been agreed by both parties and will be signed within days. As for the start date of the loan, it is not far away. Anhui Province is currently building warehouses. After the warehouses are set up and agricultural products are on the market, storage and loan can be processed, it is said.</p>
<h3>Public Security Bureau Issues Another Notice Yesterday</h3>
<p>Deadline for Smokers to Renew Licenses Approaching</p>
<p>The Shanghai Public Security Bureau has been handling the renewal of the second phase of licenses, following the deadline, which will end at the end of this month. According to the assessment, 80% of the smokers who have renewed their licenses have complied with the regulations in the first phase of registration. There are still a few smokers who have not complied with the regulations to renew their licenses. The bureau recently issued another notice yesterday, as the deadline is only ten days away, in order to urge smokers who have not renewed their licenses to renew their licenses as soon as possible, so that smokers pay attention. The original text of the notice is recorded as follows: The investigation of the renewal of the second phase of smoking cessation licenses will expire on June 30. There are only ten days left before the end of the renewal. If you still do not renew the license after the deadline, the old license will be invalid. Once discovered, you will be severely punished. The bureau is sincerely afraid that a few smokers do not understand the strict prohibition order, so it is hereby notified for your information. You must go to the responsible branch office where you live to register and renew your license before June 30, and do not delay any longer to avoid violating the law. Special notice.</p>
<p>The bureau dispatched a large number of investigators and long-term police officers to investigate smokers as the deadline for license renewal approached, and the work was very tense. Yesterday, more than 70 unlicensed smokers were found and are being interrogated separately, it is said.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government and Shanghai Banking Circles Organize Northern Jiangsu Salt Reclamation Banking Syndicate</h3>
<p>Minimum Amount of 6 Million Yuan Being Negotiated. 2 Million People Can Have Food After Reclamation</p>
<p>According to the Huadong News Agency, the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Cotton Industry Compilation Committee invited Shanghai banking circles on the 10th of this month to form a inspection group for the inspection of salt reclamation in northern Jiangsu, which has now returned to Shanghai. It is learned that the Jiangsu Provincial Government is eager to develop this wasteland and has invited banks in Shanghai to organize a salt reclamation banking syndicate. It is reported that the minimum amount is 6 million yuan, which is being negotiated. However, the success period is still far away. If it can be reclaimed as arable land, 2 million people can hope to have food to eat. More than 1 million Jiangsu natives in Shanghai can return to their hometowns and live and work in peace. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Jiangsu Province Asks to Form a Salt Reclamation Banking Syndicate After inviting banking circles to visit northern Jiangsu, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has been making great efforts to develop the barren land that can be planted with cotton. During the inspection, they repeatedly discussed with representatives of various banks. The province intends that the minimum amount should be 6 million yuan to facilitate development. However, the banking circles believe that this is not comparable to a simple short-term investment for business purposes. Although they have agreed, they have not made a concrete statement.</p>
<p>The Salt Reclamation Area Is Very Peaceful According to a financial expert who returned to Shanghai with the group yesterday, the results of this trip yielded a lot of information. Politically, it has made a lot of progress compared to when Zhang Gongquan, then general manager of the Bank of China, and others went to northern Jiangsu in the seventh year of the Republic of China. Bandits have disappeared and the local area is peaceful. Technically, there has been no progress in the past ten years. People mostly use old methods for planting. The total area of salt land in northern Jiangsu is more than 15 million mu, of which only more than 2 million mu have been reclaimed. All the sovereignty belongs to the reclamation company, so farmers have no sense of security and are unwilling to cultivate the fields diligently. This is because it is a tenant farmer nature, and has nothing to do with them after the reclamation. The capital of the salt reclamation companies is too small, and they are only focused on commercial competition and have no permanent plan. The provincial government is also involved in preventing this, which may make it difficult to attract investment from the financial community. The people are hard-working and the local area is peaceful. If the management is improved in the future, it is very promising.</p>
<p>Improved Management, Unlimited Future The existing 2 million mu of reclaimed salt land yields about 5 yuan per mu each year, with a total annual income of 10 million yuan, which can support more than 300,000 people. If all the management is mature in the future, the future will be unlimited. 15 million mu of cotton land can allow more than 500,000 households to make a living. Counting four people in a family, 2 million people can make a living from this. Each mu of land yields at least 5 yuan per year (more is unlimited), with a total annual income of more than 75 million yuan to more than 100 million yuan. The civilians in Shanghai who are waiting for food can all develop to the salt reclamation area, which is less than a thousand miles away. At the same time, the annual production of 10,000 yuan of cotton can also prevent the import of foreign cotton of the same value (this cotton can be spun into 16 to 20 count coarse yarn), which is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. It all depends on the cooperation of the government, the financial community, and the people.</p>
<p>Pan Yangyao Talks About the Prerequisites According to the New New News Agency, the Shanghai Banking Circle and the Cotton Industry Compilation Committee's inspection group for the northern Jiangsu salt reclamation area returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday. A reporter from the New New News Agency interviewed Mr. Pan Yangyao, the director of the investigation section of the Four Banks Savings Association, who participated in the group. According to him, all the salt reclamation areas in the trip have been passed through. It is estimated that the barren land that needs to be reclaimed is about 15 million mu, and only one-fifth of it has been reclaimed. Therefore, most of it is unreclaimed wasteland. According to the observations, there are three major shortcomings. Firstly, the past reclamation companies competed too much for profits. Secondly, there was no political assistance. Fifthly, there was a lack of excellent technology. Therefore, there has been no special progress in the past few years. Therefore, the banking circles know that this place is a good area for investing in rural areas, after the opening of the new canal from Nantong Jiaoxie to Chenjiagang in Haizhou, the development of rural areas has increased hope. However, for the sake of stable investment, the following problems must be solved before investment. First, political assistance, because various places in northern Jiangsu are extremely barren, bandits are rampant, and security needs to be handled by the government. Second, traffic is blocked. The reclaimed area is vast, and the transportation of agricultural products by land and water is very inconvenient. Third, soil research. The soil geology in the reclaimed area is uneven, and it must be tested first to know what should be planted where. Fourth, water conservancy research. The ports and rivers in the reclaimed area are mostly silted, and attention must also be paid to facilitate irrigation. As for the hard work and thrift of farmers in various places, they are indeed the crown of various counties in Jiangsu Province, but the hardship of life is also greater than that of various counties in Jiangnan. The rewards they have worked so hard for all year round are not enough to keep them warm and fed. The main reason is that they are exploited by commercial loans. Most of the farmers in the reclaimed area are residents of Qidong and Haimen, but they are not good at saving. The price of their hard work is mostly spent on smoking, drinking, and gambling. They do not care about the suffering of ordinary times when they have money. This is also greatly related to civilian education, it is said.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications: Outline of Measures for Reorganizing the Shipping Industry - Opinions of the Inland River Steamboat Industry Association</h3>
<p>Representatives will be sent to Beijing to present in person for consideration and adoption.</p>
<p>Since the Minister of Communications, Yu Fei, convened a meeting in Shanghai to consult with private shipping merchants for opinions on reorganization, the Shanghai Inland River Steamboat Industry Association immediately selected members with rich shipping experience and knowledge to form a subcommittee to discuss and draft opinions through several meetings. The draft was submitted and approved by the 72nd Executive Committee meeting of the association and was officially submitted to the Ministry of Communications for review yesterday. The following is a summary of the main points of the opinion letter: 1. Regarding the registration of steamboat businesses, it is believed that separate laws and regulations for the management of the steamboat industry should be drafted first, and Article 3 of the Regulations on the Supervision of Public Utilities by Private Enterprises should be amended regarding the central and local supervisory authorities, to clarify the division of power between the central and local governments and facilitate the management of shipping affairs. 2. Regarding the reorganization of scheduled routes, it is believed that the Provisional Measures for Issuing Ship Route Permits should be abolished to eliminate existing disputes over routes. For ships operating on scheduled routes, the Ministry should issue scheduled passage certificates in accordance with Article 4, Paragraph 2 of the Maritime Law. For ships operating on unscheduled routes, the competent shipping administration bureau should issue temporary passage certificates, and operating standards should be established separately for both scheduled and unscheduled services. 3. Regarding promoting shipping cooperation, it is believed that the Ministry of Communications should prescribe steps and use administrative power to enforce them, and instruct local shipping organizations to organize joint operating bureaus or water fee systems among businesses operating on the same scheduled routes. If this proves ineffective, the Ministry should order businesses on the same route to merge and form organizations. 4. Regarding the addition of ships, it is believed that the Ministry's proposed principle is in line with the principles of improving tools for public utilities and should be supported. 5. Regarding encouraging the construction of new ships and the demolition of old ships, it is believed that it should be extended to small inland river vessels, and the Ministry of Communications should consult with the Ministry of Finance to allocate the stipulated subsidies in advance for application. 6. Regarding the adjustment of sailing schedules, it is believed that it should be handled with reference to the opinions on the reorganization of scheduled routes. Changes to schedules should be submitted to the Ministry of Communications for approval before implementation. 7. Regarding the supervision of freight rates and ticket prices, it is believed that the standards for supervision should be based on Article 12 of the Regulations on the Supervision of Public Utilities by Private Enterprises, and the Ministry of Communications should jointly form a Steamboat Industry Freight Review Committee with local shipping organizations and state-owned shipping agencies to be specifically responsible for the review and supervision of freight rates. 8. Regarding the supervision of operations, it is believed that a detailed item on the supervision of operations should be included in the Steamboat Industry Supervision Rules, and a special department for the supervision of operations should be added to the Shipping Administration Department, and the organizational law of the Shipping Administration Bureau should be revised to authorize local shipping administration bureaus to supervise the operations of the shipping industry and appoint experts with rich experience and knowledge to serve as supervisory officials in charge. In addition, the following suggestions were made regarding the current problems of the shipping industry: 1. Unify the administrative authority of shipping affairs to achieve the practical effect of reorganizing the shipping industry. 2. Recover and unify the administration of port affairs to facilitate the revitalization of the shipping industry. 3. Improve the ship inspection system to raise ship inspection standards. 4. Establish a training institute for crew members to promote navigation education. 5. Organize a shipping advisory committee to seek cooperation between shipping administration and merchants to collect ideas and broaden benefits. 6. Establish a transportation dispute arbitration committee to avoid illegal competition between railways, highways, and waterways. 7. Reorganize waterways and dredge rivers to facilitate the navigation of ships. 8. State-owned and private shipping industries should cooperate to resist the intrusion of foreign shipping and seek the development of national shipping. All the opinions and suggestions are very thorough in their arguments, pinpoint the current shortcomings of shipping administration, and are indeed necessary and urgent policies for shipping administration construction and shipping industry reorganization. The entire document is tens of thousands of words long, with precise opinions and fluent writing, making it an important resource for reorganizing the private shipping industry. It is reported that the association will send representatives to Beijing again when necessary to present detailed opinions on the reorganization of the shipping industry for reference by the transportation authorities.</p>
<h3>Commodity Inspection: Raw Silk Inspection Conference Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>Silk experts from the League of Nations attended to provide guidance; a proposal to revise the draft standard.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce convened a silk industry conference of four provinces, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, and Sichuan, at the International Trade Bureau auditorium at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. More than 30 representatives, including Chu Hui-seng, Shen Chen, Huang Ji-wen, Qian Feng-gao, Cheng Bing-ruo, and Zhu Jing-an, attended. After the chairman, Miao Zhong-xiu, presided over the ceremony, the chairman reported, stating that the quality of raw silk exported from China is not uniform, and merchants often mix inferior quality silk for sale overseas. As a result, various countries have a poor impression of raw silk produced in China. To restore credibility, the bureau has specifically stipulated inspection methods for raw silk products. Then, the draft inspection standard was submitted. As a result of the discussion, the participating representatives believed that because the silk reeling machines used in China are outdated, it would be difficult to immediately improve the product standards and raise the standards to the level of the draft standard, and silk factories would be adversely affected. They proposed that the bureau revise the draft standard. Finally, two silk experts from the League of Nations, Mr. Manfield and Mr. Ma Yue, provided guidance on various methods related to sericulture, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Exchange Rate Continues to Decline</h3>
<p>Ta Kung She reported that the price of silver dollars in Guangzhou plummeted due to the recent incidents in Guangdong Province, reaching a low of 645 Shanghai dollars per 1,000 Guangdong dollars. After the financial community made efforts to stabilize the situation and military actions eased, the price of silver dollars gradually recovered to 670 dollars. However, due to the current situation and the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, the Guangdong exchange rate has fallen again. Yesterday morning, the standard exchange rate of the Bank of China was only 650 dollars per Guangdong dollar, and the exchange amount was still limited to 1,000 dollars.</p>
<h3>Postal Remittances Between Shanghai and Guangdong Continue as Usual</h3>
<p>Other postal services in Guangdong and Guangxi are also operating normally.</p>
<p>According to a Central News Agency report, since Guangxi Province announced a ban on postal remittances from outside the province, the Shanghai Post Office has not received any remittances from Guangxi. Therefore, postal remittances to Guangdong are still operating as usual, except for Guangxi. Other postal services to Guangdong and Guangxi are also operating normally.</p>
<h3>Telegram from the Shanghai Alumni Association of the Police Academy</h3>
<p>According to the Shen Shi News Agency, the Shanghai Alumni Association of the Police Academy sent two telegrams yesterday. One telegram was addressed to the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang in Nanjing, stating that "Reports indicate that Guangdong and Guangxi are using the name of resisting Japan to carry out secession, invading the border of Hunan, and acting recklessly, despite repeated appeals from the entire country. It seems that they are willing to be accomplices of the enemy and are being used by others. At a time when the national crisis is urgent and the nation is in danger, spiritual unity and concentrated efforts to save the nation are not enough. How can we allow the unauthorized use of force to split the country, losing our minds and going crazy? This is the worst possible scenario. We hereby telegraph again, requesting that effective measures be taken promptly to resolutely stop the chaos, to save the nation and prevent its demise. We are extremely anxious." The other telegram was addressed to Mr. Guangzhou Jie Bonan, Mr. Nanning Li Delin, and Mr. Bai Jiansheng, stating that "Since the September 18th Incident, some parties have been plotting against us more urgently, (omitted) the national situation is extremely dangerous. All Chinese people should unite sincerely to save the nation from danger. However, recent reports indicate that Guangdong and Guangxi have launched troops to invade the border of Hunan, which is shocking. As senior members of the party and the country, you clearly understand the great righteousness. At a time when the national crisis is urgent and the nation is in danger, how can you bear to start a civil war again? We implore you to take the overall situation into consideration, stop military action, and wait for the decision of the Second Plenary Session. The party and the country will be fortunate, and the nation will be fortunate."</p>

<h3>Chunhe Steamer's Telegram Reports Grounding</h3>
<p>Although not in danger... there is no major problem.</p>
<p>The Chunhe steamer of He Feng Xin Ji Company, rented to the Continental Industrial Company, operates to Haizhou and other places. This time, it departed from Shanghai to Haizhou and ran aground near Yanwei Port (near Chenjiagang in Haizhou) on the afternoon of the 20th after accidentally leaving the fairway. The company received a telegram from the ship yesterday stating that it had not yet been rescued. It is reported that the grounding site is sandy and muddy, and the ship is not seriously damaged.

<h3>Huaping Steamer's Telegram Reports Rescue</h3>
<p>It has been driven to Quanzhou to unload cargo yesterday.</p>
<p>The Huaping steamer of the Minxin Company, weighing 1,500 tons, loaded a large shipment of flour and groceries in Shanghai on the 18th of this month and sailed to Sizhou, Fujian. At about 2:00 p.m. on the 21st, it was sailing outside the port of Quanzhou when it was forced to hit a reef due to bad weather, difficult navigation, and rapid currents. After the accident, it telegraphed the Shanghai office to report and tried to get out of danger. According to the company yesterday, the ship was rescued yesterday morning (22nd) and has been driven to Quanzhou. It is currently unloading cargo. Whether there is damage to the bottom of the ship will be known after the cargo is unloaded and inspected. Because the bottom of the ship is double-layered, it can still sail after hitting a reef.</p>
<h3>Public Health Development in the Past Four Years</h3>
<p>Issued by the Municipal Government</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government yesterday released the public health development in the past four years, stating that the city government has added six clinics, three hospitals, one isolation hospital, multiple drug rehabilitation centers, and one health testing laboratory in the past four years, which can represent the general progress in public health. The health plan is divided into six items: 1. To improve the city's sanitation, inspect beverages and food, and clean streets and rivers. 2. To prevent the spread of epidemics, the implementation methods are: a. Free vaccination. b. Promote health education to make the general public aware of the importance of health. 3. To protect the health of the general public, such as stipulating the working hours and treatment of pregnant female workers, and investigating school health conditions. The other two plans are: 1. To conduct scientific analysis of the insulation problem in the testing laboratory. 2. To compile a household survey form. In addition, there is also a kind of work related to hygiene, which is the inspection of meat. As of the end of last year, a total of 450,100 dan of various types of meat were inspected. As a result, very little rotten meat was found on the market. The establishment of isolation hospitals is also one of the important health facilities. A total of 1,619 male patients and 1,277 female patients were treated in the past two years. Drug rehabilitation work is also one of the aspects of the city government's health plan. In the past four years, drug rehabilitation centers have been established in Nanshi, Zhabei, and Longhua, and a drug offender rehabilitation center has been established on Jinyi Road. The four drug rehabilitation centers have cured 7,006 drug addicts. The greatest success of the city government's health plan in the past four years is the construction of a municipal hospital, a health testing laboratory, and a medical school, all of which are nearing completion. The municipal hospital can currently accommodate 200 beds, and will be expanded to 2,000 to 3,000 beds in the future. The medical school can accommodate 300 students.</p>

<h3>Zhu Xiongwu's Case of Soliciting Litigation: Trial Concluded, Sentencing Scheduled; Only One Witness, Xu, Appeared at the Trial Yesterday; Prosecutor Argued for Multiple Offenses to be Combined and Punished Severely; Dismissed Clerk of the Jiangsu High Court Was Placed</h3>
<p>Zhu Xiongwu, a dismissed clerk of the Jiangsu High Court, was arrested and sent to the Wuxian District Court for defamation of the court president, Zhu Shusheng. During the investigation, it was discovered that Zhu Xiongwu had colluded with Chen Chao-zuan, another clerk of the court, and Lu Wenguang, a lawyer's clerk,</p>
<p>to solicit litigation and defraud people of money in as many as eight cases. The prosecuting prosecutor filed a public prosecution against Zhu et al., and the Supreme Court ruled that Zhu Xiongwu be transferred to the jurisdiction of the Shanghai First Special District Court. For the convenience of the trial, the Wuxian District Court sent Chen and Lu to Shanghai together with Zhu for a joint trial. Huang Risheng, a judge of the First Special Court, has held two court sessions, summoned witnesses, and interrogated them. Chen was released on bail of 500 yuan, and Zhu and Lu were remanded in custody pending further interrogation. All the details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, the third</p>
<p>trial was held. Only one witness, Xu, appeared. According to Xu, the Yutai Company in this city was collecting debts from the Zoucangtai Rice Mill in Wuxi. He testified about the situation during the mediation at Ji Yunqing's house in Wuxi, saying that Zhu Xiongwu was not present when the mediation agreement was written. Later, he saw Jiang Hongbin, a partner of Yutai Company, in the pavilion of Ji's house, but he did not talk to him at the time. Jiang testified in court earlier that after receiving the 5,000 yuan from Zou Cangtai, he gave 2,500 yuan to us as a reward, which was not true. However, Jiang told me on the train back to Shanghai that he would ask the manager after he got to the store</p>
<p>for instructions before rewarding us again, but so far there has been no action. The court then continued to interrogate the defendant Lu Wenguang about soliciting Li Shannan's appeal and demanding compensation from Li. Lu still pleaded guilty, saying that although Li's letter to him had such a tone, Li did not accuse me of soliciting in his previous testimony. The court decided to interrogate Chen Chaozuan about the reason for the phrase "special relationship" in his letter to Zhu Xiongwu. Chen admitted that it was</p>
<p>an inappropriate term at the time and had no other hidden meaning. Then, Zhu Xiongwu was repeatedly interrogated about his relationship with Jiang Hongbin, his motive for participating in the debt mediation between Yutai and Zou Cangtai, and the process. However, Zhu resolutely denied having taken such actions. He was also asked about the reason for communicating with Weng Jun. Zhu said that he could not remember because it had been many years. Finally, he was asked about the letter signed "Zhu Xinfu" to Lu Wenguang found in Lu's house. What case was mentioned in the letter? And what was the intention of the note written in Zhu's own handwriting, congratulating each other on getting rich, and addressing each other as brothers, which was also found in Lu's house? Zhu said that Lu's nephew, Ru Yide, had admitted in his previous testimony that it was a joke. As for the note, although it was my playful writing, I cannot be considered to have committed a crime by writing this note. The court pointed out that it had been verified that Zhu Xinfu, or Zhu Yi-wu, was Zhu Xiongwu's name, so Zhu Xinfu was also an alias of the defendant, and the envelope of the letter was from the Jiangsu High Court. Lu was Zhu's friend, and the letter was found in Lu's house, so it was definitely not Lu who</p>
<p>framed Zhu. He was ordered to state the whole story clearly, but Zhu always said that he did not know. Judge Huang stated that the evidence had been</p>
<p>investigated and ordered the debate to begin. The prosecutor then rose to argue, mainly stating that Zhu had colluded with the lawyer's clerk and communicated with each other. Although it is difficult to verify each of the points accused, the letters for reconciliation and requests for payment are enough to constitute the crimes of soliciting lawsuits, defrauding money, and dereliction of duty. The correspondence between Chen and Zhu leaked the news of the court's handling of the case. Lu's publicity has been found in several cases based on the evidence, and it can be inferred that there are more undiscovered cases. He should be punished severely for multiple offenses. Then, the defendant's lawyer gave his defense, saying that the results of the investigation were not sufficient to constitute the crimes charged. After the defense was completed, the court ordered Chen to pay the original bail, and Zhu and Lu were remanded in custody to await sentencing at 2:00 p.m. on the 29th of this month.</p>
<h3>Zhichengxing Silk Store Robbed of More Than 1,000 Yuan: Three Checks and More Than 300 Yuan in Cash</h3>
<p>At about 10:40 a.m. yesterday, four robbers suddenly went to Zhichengxing Silk Store at No. 4, Lane 572, Sichuan Road. Three robbers were wearing light gray cloth long gowns, and one robber was wearing short clothes and spoke with a Ningbo accent. After breaking into the store, they took out guns and shouted at the shop assistants and apprentices, driving them to the kitchen at the back of the store and sending one robber to guard them with a gun. Then, they forced the store's accountant to hand over the keys to all the important boxes and cabinets. The person in charge of the accounting room had no way to resist and had to obey. Then, the robbers began to search, and after about twenty minutes, they withdrew and fled without a trace. The shop assistants were then able to regain their freedom and urgently checked the cabinets. It was discovered that they were robbed of a 900 yuan current check from the Shanghai Bank, a 205.4 yuan current check from the Guohuo Bank, a 200 yuan ticket from the Ankang Money Shop, and more than 300 yuan in cash. Together with the 30 yuan in cash that the shop assistant Qi Xiaolin was robbed of, the total amount reached about 1,800 yuan. They then provided a detailed list of losses to the Central Police Station and requested that they be apprehended. After receiving the report, the police station sent detectives to investigate and strictly apprehend the robbers.</p>
<h3>Wang Erniang Committed Assault, Seriously Injuring a Nine-Year-Old Girl; Surgery Required, Life May Be in Danger; It is Reported that the Defendant Suffers from Mental Illness</h3>
<p>Wang Ashou from Suzhou had a daughter named Zhao Di, who is now nine years old, after his wife died. Wang then took Li, a prostitute, as his second wife and lived together at No. 6 Ankang Lane, Yunnan Road. Wang Erniang, a prostitute from Hangzhou who is also a prostitute like Li, is still working as a prostitute at No. 10 Huile Lane, Yunnan Road. Because she is very close to Li, she often comes and goes. At 1:30 p.m. on the 20th of this month, Wang Erniang met Zhao Di at the entrance of Ankang Lane and invited her to her house. She asked Zhao Di if Zhao Di's family members were at her house. At first, Zhao Di said no, but then she said that they were definitely at her house. Wang, the prostitute, thought that she was so young and was telling lies, so she punched her in the abdomen several times and hit her face with the bottom of her slippers, causing Zhao Di's face to swell, her waist to be seriously injured, her expression to change drastically, and blood to flow from her urine. Wang Adu reported the case, and Chinese detective Cao Qishan arrested Wang, the prostitute, and took her back to the Old Gate Police Station, transferred her to the Women's Detention Center, and sent Zhao Di to Renji Hospital. Examination revealed that her kidneys had been damaged and her injuries were very serious. Surgery was required, and her life may be in danger. Yesterday morning, Wang Erniang was sent to the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang prosecuted her in accordance with Article 278, Section 1 of the Criminal Law, and stated that Wang Zhao Di could not attend court because of her serious injuries, so he requested that the hearing be postponed. Wang Erniang confessed that she beat Zhao Di because she was lying and asked for leniency. Police lawyer Wang stated that it was reported that the defendant suffered from mental illness. After Judge Qian Hongye reported the case, he ordered that the hearing be postponed for one week.</p>
<h3>Male Passenger Committed Suicide by Jumping into the River When the Jiangxin Ship Left Songkou; - Left Two Suicide Notes -; - The Deceased Had No Name -</h3>
<p>On the morning of the 15th of this month, the Jiangxin steamer of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company set sail from Shanghai to Hankou at 7:00 a.m. After 10:00 a.m., when the ship was sailing on the Yangtze River, the comprador found that a male passenger in cabin No. 18 was missing, leaving behind two letters, one to the Customs Water Police Station and one to his wife, as well as a blue short shirt and a wallet containing a pawn ticket worth 15 yuan. It was known that the passenger had committed suicide by jumping into the river. The belongings were retained and sent to the Customs Water Police Station yesterday when the ship returned to Shanghai. After inspecting the contents of the two letters, the one to the Water Police Station stated, "Dear Sirs, I am tired of the world and wish to be buried in the belly of a fish. There is a wallet containing a pawn ticket. Please send it to No. 1 Heqiao Street, Songjiang." On the side was written, "Although Bo Ren did not kill me, I died because of Bo Ren." The sentence was inverted. The letter to his wife contained many complaints, which are transcribed as follows, "Dear wife, I have become a ghost in a foreign land. It is not that I am cruelly leaving you. My mother is oppressing me to such an extent that I am sitting in a city of sorrow. How can I live? Now I am willing to sacrifice everything. After I die, my mother's view of you is predictable. I hope you can get by and do not hurt yourself because of me. You must know that you are already pregnant, but how can I not know where the daily living expenses come from? The days are like years, who can pity me? I will point you to a clear path. If my mother cannot tolerate you, please go to the Women's Relief Association (there is also one in Songjiang), and you will have a way to live. My heart aches now, and tears are falling like rain. My body is dead, but my heart is not, all for you. In short, all the blame is on me. I am begging for forgiveness in writing, and I will ensure your health and well-being in the afterlife. I did not sleep well last night. You must be crying to death because you did not see me come home. This is all my fault. Wife, you must see through some things. Life is like a dream. There is a place to be born and a place to die. People cannot be resurrected. Crying to death is useless. I hope you will understand and take care of yourself. Protect my sister. Wife, my heart aches and I can only meet you in my dreams. Guilty husband, farewell, June 14." The police officer, as the deceased's name was unknown, ordered that the letters be sent to the local court for verification and recognition.</p>
<h3>Quarrel Over Settling Usurious Loan Leads to Homicide: Ji Laoer Strikes Sun Tan in the Face with an Axe; Gun Discharges, Killing Ji Shilin; Debate Declared Closed, Sentencing Scheduled</h3>
<p>Ji Laoer, also known as A Mao and nicknamed Xiao Chongming, from Nantong, was a peddler who previously lent money at usurious rates at 8 Runde South Lane, Lagenay Road, French Concession. Wu Chen, wife of Wu Genxiang from Suzhou, borrowed a gold ring as collateral for eight yuan. As it was not repaid for a long time, it was converted into a "little ball" usurious loan, charging six copper coins in interest per yuan per day, totaling 480 coins. Subsequently, Ji was arrested and imprisoned for another offense, and the interest payments ceased. Recently, Ji was released and, on the afternoon of the fourth of this month, Wu Chen met Ji and invited him to her home to demand repayment of the principal and interest, leading to an argument and fight. Both parties agreed to meet at the Yihe Teahouse on Lagenay Road from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM the next afternoon for arbitration. At the appointed time, Wu Chen reported to the French police, accusing Ji Laoer of extortion. The patrol chief dispatched Detective Sun Qiwan, No. 76, to rush to the Yihe Teahouse to arrest Ji. Ji struck Detective Sun in the face with an axe. Ji's brother, Shilin, also grabbed a weapon to resist. The detective drew his gun in self-defense, but it discharged, and the bullet struck Ji Shilin in a vital spot, killing him. The police arrested Ji Laoer. The body was inspected by the court and claimed for burial. Ji Laoer was sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation and detention. The details have been reported previously. The case has now been concluded by the Field Police Department. Yesterday, Judge Wang Wangxu of the Second Special Court opened the Second Criminal Court for trial. Lawyer Yao Zhaodi from the Police Department explained the investigation process, prosecuting Ji for assault and attempted murder. Then, the plaintiff, Wu Chen, stated that the defendant borrowed 30 yuan from her for her engagement and had not repaid the principal or interest to this day. When she demanded payment, he instead resorted to violence and extortion, so she reported him to the police. Detective Sun Qiwan testified that he was standing at the top of the stairs and reached out to handcuff the defendant. The defendant struck him with an axe, and his brother also produced a weapon to resist. He fell down the stairs and drew his gun in self-defense. His fall triggered the gun, causing it to fire. Witness Chen Hexiang, the teahouse waiter, testified that the woman's side (i.e., Wu Chen's side) arrived first with four people for tea. The defendant arrived later with more than ten people. Then, a person in gray clothes (i.e., a plainclothes detective) came, and a person in black pointed out the defendant to the person in gray, saying, "That's him." The person in gray reached out to handcuff the defendant, but the defendant resisted, and the handcuffs fell to the ground. The defendant's brother struck with an axe, but the person in gray blocked it and drew his gun. The defendants immediately fled. He did not see anyone being killed. The defendant denied assaulting the plaintiff the day before, claiming that he was the one who was assaulted first, and that the teahouse meeting was initiated by Chen Xianrong because he and Chen Xianrong had a past. He did not request the teahouse meeting himself. He requested that Chen Xiangrong be summoned, but he was not. The court considered the investigation complete and ordered the opening of the debate. The Police Department lawyer argued that the defendant assaulted Wu Chen and her husband, leaving visible injuries, and violently attacked the detective, attempting murder. The Police Department's investigation confirmed these facts, and he requested that the defendant be punished according to the law. Lawyers Cai Xiaobai and Song Tuxiang, representing the defendant, argued that the plaintiff Wu Chen was guilty of excessive usury, false accusation, and the killing of the defendant's brother, Ji Shilin, requesting that the case be transferred for investigation. Judge Wang reviewed the arguments and declared the debate closed, scheduling the sentencing for 9:00 AM on the 27th. The defendant was remanded to custody, and Wu Chen was handed over to the Police Department for investigation.</p>
<h3>Russian Man Kills Unidentified Man While Drunk; Arrested and Brought to Court for Trial Yesterday; Defendant Claims Intoxication and Ignorance</h3>
<p>Le Peitai Fu (transliteration), a 28-year-old Russian from Siberia residing at 23, Lane 1295, Route Lafayette, French Concession, and working as a clerk at a certain club on Dixwell Road, Hongkou, was drinking heavily at a small restaurant near Gujiazhai Park at around 9:00 AM on the 21st. He hired a rickshaw to return home. When he arrived in front of the foreign-style house at 551 Route Lafayette, he got out of the rickshaw but refused to pay the fare. The rickshaw puller demanded payment, but the Russian instead assaulted him. The rickshaw puller fled in fear. At that moment, an unidentified man, about 30 years old, wearing a blue short-sleeved shirt and black pants, bald and barefoot, was walking from west to east on Route Lafayette. The Russian mistook the man for the rickshaw puller and pushed him violently. The man lost his balance and fell to the ground, injuring his head and losing consciousness. The Russian continued to punch and kick him. Habison, a clerk at the Meitong Motor Company, and a chauffeur from car number 11079 happened to be passing by and intervened. They summoned Chinese Constable Lin Guisheng, number 480, who arrested the Russian and took him, along with the injured man, to the police station. The injured man was sent to Guangci Hospital, while the Russian was detained pending investigation. The injured man died at 4:00 PM that afternoon due to severe head trauma. The police took the body to the Tongren Fuyuan funeral parlor for examination. Yesterday, Prosecutor Wang Ren from the Second Special Court, accompanied by a forensic doctor, arrived at the scene and confirmed that the man's death was due to a head injury caused by the fall. The body was buried by Tongren Fuyuan funeral parlor pending identification. After the examination, the Police Department transferred the defendant, Le Peitai Fu, to Criminal Court One of the Second Special Court. Lawyer Gu Shouxi from the Police Department presented the case and requested a postponement of the investigation before requesting an inquiry. Then, Detective Yang Yilong, along with witnesses Habison and Constable 480, reported the investigation and witnessed the defendant assaulting the deceased, pushing him down, and the process of arresting the defendant. When questioned, the defendant claimed to have been drunk at the time and unaware of why he hit the man. He only learned about the fight at the police station. Judge Li Changnian reviewed the testimony and ordered the defendant to be remanded to custody for further questioning on the 29th.</p>
<h3>Joint Venture to Mine Nickel-Iron Ore; Investment Money Mysteriously Disappears; Russian Claims to Have Gone Out to Urinate, Suspicions Arise; Zhang Yunchang and Wang Guichun Detained Together</h3>
<p>Wu Yunsheng, a native of Ningbo, 41 years old, residing at 6 Fengyu Lane, Beizhanjie Road, and working for the Nanyang Advertising Company, was recently invited by Zhang Yunchang, a native of Anhui residing at 131 Yuyingtang Road, Zhabei, to jointly invest in mining nickel-iron ore in Suzhou, Anhui Province. Through Zhang's introduction, Wang Guichun, a local coal mine owner residing at 27 Dongjunyi Lane, Haining Road, joined the venture. Wang then introduced Russian engineer Garschanov, residing at 3, Lane 50, Route Watt, to the project. A house at 240 Route Albert, French Concession, was rented as the company's office. They agreed to raise capital through stock subscriptions. Wu advanced 4,000 yuan for initial expenses, and Zhang contributed 1,000 yuan. On the 18th of this month, Wu and Zhang took the money to the office and placed it on a desk. While the Russian engineer excused himself to go out and urinate, Wu discovered that all the banknotes on the desk had disappeared, and the Russian was also gone. He ordered Zhang and Wang to look for him. On the evening of the previous day, Wu and the others found the Russian engineer on Route Watt and took him to Huishan Police Station. As the incident occurred in the French Concession, they sent him to the French police. After investigation by Inspector Qian Chenglong and others, Zhang Yunchang and Wang Guichun were also suspected, and they were detained together with the Russian. Yesterday, they were sent to Criminal Court Eight of the Second Special Court. Judge Sun Pengnian conducted the trial. Lawyer Yuan Jiahuang from the Police Department stated that the investigation was not yet complete and requested a postponement of the trial. Then, Detective Tian Shiqing reported the case, claiming that the Russian said that Wu Yunsheng wanted to transform the banknotes, turning a small amount into a large amount. The plaintiff Wu Yunsheng explained the disappearance of the banknotes and the process of joining Zhang Yunchang in running the mining business. He denied that he wanted to transform the banknotes. He claimed that at the time, two of the Russian's accomplices left the neighboring room first, and then Garschanov also excused himself and left. When he found him and questioned him, Ga admitted his fault and was willing to go to the police station. When questioned, Zhang Yunchang and Wang Guichun both denied participating in the fraud, and Garschanov also denied it. However, Garschanov said that on the 11th, he saw Wu immerse 1,000 yuan in banknotes and another Russian who spoke English in medicine and locked them in a drawer. The court reviewed the testimony and ordered a further hearing on the morning of July 3. Zhang was released on bail, while Wang and Garschanov were remanded to custody.</p>
<h3>Red Pill Seller, Chen Zhengshi, Exposed Drug Den; Confessed to Drug Organization; Multiple Types of Red Pill Ingredients Seized; Three Suspects Arrested on the Spot; Main Culprit, Old Anhui, Fled</h3>
<p>Chen Zhengshi, a 50-year-old woman from Anhui residing at 170 Yichang Road, Hongkou, whose husband, nicknamed Old Anhui, was engaged in the drug trade. Recently, she partnered with Xie Chengtang, a fellow villager, and Yang Zhengxi, from Dantu, to secretly establish a drug den at 668 Zhejiang Road, manufacturing red pills for sale. To avoid attention, Chen Zhengshi was assigned to transport the drugs. At 9:20 AM on the morning of the previous day, Chen Zhengshi was carrying three packets of red pills, totaling 1,500 pills, when she was intercepted by detectives at the intersection of Park Road and Avenue Edward VII. She was arrested, and the three packets of red pills were seized. Based on her confession, the detectives went to the drug den at 668 Zhejiang Road and apprehended Yang and Xie. Old Anhui was at large. Twenty packets of red pills, weighing over five pounds, one packet of raw materials, weighing four pounds, a vat of medicinal ingredients, weighing over nine pounds, as well as a opium pipe, a sieve, a lead basket, and other items were seized and taken to the Xinza Gate police station. They were separately detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to Criminal Court Eight of the First Special District Court. Police Lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted the three defendants under Articles 256 and 257, Clause 2, of the Criminal Code, and described the above situation, saying that the capital for the drug den was planned by Chen Zhengshi's husband, Old Anhui. When questioned, Chen Zhengshi denied the charges, claiming that she had obtained the red pills by gambling with Yang and others for six yuan and intended to bring them back for her husband to eat. After Judge Tan Xinzhen questioned Yang Zhengxi and Xie Chengtang, he ordered them to remain in custody for further questioning in seven days.</p>
<h3>Wu Yeru and Wang Pinjuan, Husband and Wife, Cross-Accusation Case Continued Yesterday; Hearing Adjourned Due to Incomplete Evidence</h3>
<p>Wu Yeru, a merchant from Minhang Town, Shanghai County, operated the Defengxing Flower Factory in Xinjing, Northwest Shanghai. His wife, Wang Pinjuan, resided in Minhang. The couple had separated. Wang Pinjuan accused Wu of assault, while Wu, through Lawyer Wu Lvping, accused Wang Pinjuan of being an absconded concubine and theft. The case was heard by the Criminal Court of the Shanghai District Court. Wang Pinjuan claimed to be Wu Yeru's wife, but Wu was having an affair, neglected their livelihood, and instigated assault, stealing their daughter. The hearing was adjourned for further investigation. Yesterday, Judge Zhang continued the hearing. Wu Yeru raised the issue of Wang Pinjuan's identity again, stating that Wang Pinjuan had secretly fled on the night of June 5 without a trace, and that he had filed a complaint with the Criminal Court regarding the plaintiff's assault. The copy of her complaint identified her as the plaintiff's concubine. If she was his spouse, then she could not file a self-accusation according to the law. He also stated that he was in Shanghai, and the defendant wandered around Shanghai instead of managing the household because he did not allow her to smoke opium. She always hired a special car from the Shanghai Motor Company and roamed between Shanghai and Minhang more than once. On the 3rd and 4th of this month, she again hired a car to go to Shanghai. Her last trip was at 6:00 PM on the 5th of this month. Wang Baosheng and others could testify to this, and the Public Security Bureau had a record of it. The facts were true, and the crime was certain, so he requested prosecution. Because the witnesses were not all present, the judge adjourned the hearing to allow for the summoning of additional witnesses.</p>
<h3>Zhang Xiaolin Arrested for Assembling a Crowd to Commit Assault</h3>
<p>Sun Dexing, of Huining Road, Nanshi, owned sixteen rooms, two of which he sublet to Zhang Bingjun to open a small restaurant. Han Yutai collected the rent. However, Zhang owed more than one hundred yuan in rent. Sun sued him in the District Court and obtained a judgment for execution, requiring Zhang to post bail for the amount.

<h3>Fugitive Arrested in Zhejiang's Shizhai Village Robbery and Murder Case; Escorted to First Special District Court Yesterday Morning to Notify Zhejiang Provincial Court for Extradition</h3>
<p>In 1933, five or six robbers broke into the home of the Shi family in Shizhai Village, Zhejiang Province, armed with weapons, and attempted to rob them.

<h3>Liu Qichang Sentenced to Six Months for Extortion; Acquitted of Charges Related to the Yangtze Hotel</h3>
<p>Liu Changqi, the former manager of the Anlegong dance hall, and Wang Yaoxiang, Xue Qiyuan, and Zheng Daozhi were all friends. In January of this year, they jointly rented Room 106 of the Yuan Dong Hotel as a place of entertainment. At that time, Wang Yaoxiang was extremely fond of two courtesans, Er Nian and San Nian, from the Fengya brothel at 22 Huile Lane, and frequently called for them. On the 10th of that month, Zheng Daozhi also called for Fengya's Er Nian and San Nian at Room 547 of the Dongfang Hotel. When Liu Changqi and others learned of this, they believed that Zheng should not steal another's love, so they sent Xue Qiyuan, accompanied by Chai Yiqing and Cha Yiyuan, to Room 319 of the Dachina Hotel on the 13th to negotiate with Zheng, demanding that Zheng pay 50 yuan to settle the matter. Zheng only had 15 yuan on him at the time, which Xue and the others took away. However, Xue and the others were still not satisfied. The next day, they went to Room 704 of the Yangtze Hotel and robbed Zheng of his gold watch, worth over one hundred yuan. Zheng reported this to the Laozha Police Station, who ordered the detectives to arrest Xue, Chai, and Cha. They were handed over to the First Special District Court for trial. Xue was sentenced to nine months in prison, while Chai and Cha were acquitted. Liu Changqi had already fled. On the 14th of the month, at 1:20 AM, Chinese Detective Song Wenqing of the Laozha Police Station arrested Liu at the Far East Dance Hall and handed him over to the First Special Court for interrogation. Yesterday morning, Criminal Judge Qian Hongye opened Criminal Court One for further hearings. Police Lawyer Wang Yaotang prosecuted Liu for extortion. When questioned, Liu Changqi denied extortion, claiming that he only demanded payment from Zheng Daozhi for debts owed to the Far East Company's room. The court then called Xue Qiyuan to the stand for identification. Although Xue had identified Liu as the person from his previous testimony at the police station, he suddenly claimed today that he did not know Liu. Liu also claimed that he did not know Xue. After Judge Qian reviewed the testimony, he sentenced Liu in court to six months in prison for extortion, acquitting him of the charges related to the Yangtze Hotel.</p>

<h3>Lin Ji Gengsi Stage Premieres Eight Episodes of Tang Monk's Journey to the West</h3>
<p>The premiere of eight episodes of Tang Monk's Journey to the West at the Gengxin Stage has been widely publicized for a long time, making people from all walks of life eagerly anticipate it. It is now scheduled for its premiere on the night of the belated Dragon Boat Festival. It is said that the reason for the delayed premiere is that the stage is determined to strive for perfection in everything and absolutely refuses to do things carelessly. Therefore, it has been actively arranged and researched and prepared for more than half a year. For example, the Wind and Fire Wheels under the feet of the Red Boy, where people step on them and the flames rise high, engaging in several major battles with Sun Wukong, with water and fire clashing, and finally engaging in a great battle of magic with Guanshiyin, performing various amazing feats, require months of research and practice, and it took several failures to succeed. This is just one example. In addition, the new script and time-consuming rehearsals, and the dozens of grand sets and dozens of large and small scientific and magical mechanisms in the entire play, are all completely new and made from scratch, with absolutely no old items mixed in. This is the main reason for the stage's delayed premiere. As for everything in the play, the stage not only strives for everything to be new, but also strives for it to be both new and exceptionally good. The number of sets and mechanisms has been greatly increased, creating the newest and highest record for stage plays. The several major magic battles before and after will especially make the audience dazzled and fascinated, surpassing the viewing of dozens of large sets of Chinese and Western magic, creating an unprecedented spectacle in the stage sky. It is said that in addition to the original full cast, the stage has also hired many famous new male and female actors to join the eight episodes, playing key roles. Therefore, the three words "new," "good," and "many" are the general outline of the stage's eight episodes.</p>

<h3>Our National World Games Football Team: European Tour Miscellany – June 12th, Letter from Li Huitang in Medan</h3>
<p>Closing Act: Harmony Prevails</p>
<p>June 5th marked the final match of our team's Java leg. The opponent was the Batavia’s Qunli Youth team, a combined team of two Chinese teams. After our victory over the league leaders with a score of 7-2 yesterday, our athletes felt quite fatigued despite their best efforts. Today, as one big family, there was no fierce competition. We arranged for those who were tired to have a rest, fielding the following lineup:</p>
<p>(That day at 11:00 AM, the Guangzhao Association held a welcome and farewell meeting, with the reporter offering thanks.)</p>
<p>Bao Jiaping, Tan Jiangbai, Mai Shaohan, Li Guowei, Liang Rongzhao, Zhang Xianyuan, Yang Shuiyi, Zhuo Shijin, Sun Jinshun, Huang Meishun, Jia Youliang</p>
<p>The first half ended 0-0, with the final score being 3-0. Jiangbai scored twice, and Jingxiang once.</p>
<p>This match was an internal affair. Although it was our team's final performance, the audience was sparse. The players were very polite, and the game was not tense at all. It is not surprising that the stands were deserted. Our team's performance in the first half was mediocre, resulting in a lack of highlights. In the second half, Li Tiansheng replaced Tan Jiangbai, and Wang Bai and Jingxiang were moved to the front line to replace Jinshun and Shijin. The forward line became more lively after this change, with Jiangbai and Jingxiang scoring successively. The opponent's skills were unremarkable. Even Li Yuxin, whom we considered promising and who had been selected to participate in the preliminary rounds, did not demonstrate any exceptional ability. Although our team's defense was not particularly strong, it was more than adequate. In the end, we won 3-0, concluding our Java tour with a record of ten wins and one draw.</p>
<p>This kind of record was previously achieved by South China in 1931. Our team's tour of Java this time possessed greater strength and should have achieved even more. However, due to the tight schedule, the hot weather, and unfavorable terrain, our true abilities could not be fully displayed. Moreover, to test our formation, the lineup was changed in every match, which slightly affected our teamwork. We only considered ourselves satisfied with three or four of the eleven performances in Java. However, in the dozen or so trials after leaving the country, although we made some sacrifices at the time, we did discover some of our own weaknesses, which was still valuable. As for impressions outside of the matches, this time we arrived and left in a hurry at each stop, like viewing flowers from horseback, and we didn’t really see anything much. The most obvious thing was the overseas Chinese compatriots’ very eager expectations for us. That's all. The reporter hopes to write a special article about the details of football in Java within ten days, which I'm afraid will be something domestic fans will enjoy reading.</p>
<p>Five-Hour Flight</p>
<p>After concluding our Java matches on June 5th, all the overseas Chinese organizations in Batavia held a farewell banquet that night at the Great Eastern Restaurant. The toasting and revelry reached a climax. After Consul-General Song gave his speech, Rong Jun and the reporter responded with thanks. The next morning, in order to make it to Singapore for the match against the Army-Navy Combined team on the 7th (Sunday), our team selected thirteen players, led by Director Rong, to fly to Singapore on a special plane. The remaining players would take a ship this afternoon to meet them in Singapore and then travel to Medan together. The selected players for the flight were Bao Jiaping, Li Tiansheng, Tan Jiangbai, Liang Rongzhao, Xu Yahui, Chen Zhenhe, Li Guowei, Cao Guicheng, Feng Jingxiang, Ye Beihua, Zheng Jiliang, and Huang Meishun. At 5:00 AM, after washing up, they drove to the airport. Dawn was just breaking, and the plane took off. Among these fourteen people, only Guowei and Jiliang were first-timers. Guowei was very curious, asking questions incessantly, while Jiliang's heart was pounding like a deer, trembling with fear. The whole team teased them all the more. Yahui and Xiao Heitan (Little Black Coal), with their aviation student qualifications, lectured and pointed, explaining the use of the instruments with great interest. After takeoff, they looked down at the cities and mountains, as clear as in a picture book. Sometimes, they looked down at the sea of clouds, which was a magnificent sight. When the plane passed over South Sumatra, they saw dense forests, endless as far as the eye could see. After five hours in the air, they landed safely at the Singapore airport at 11:05 AM, safely passing another dangerous moment. They drove back to the New Asia Hotel to rest and prepare for the fierce battle tomorrow.</p>
<p>Four Goose Eggs Given to the Army-Navy Combined Team</p>
<p>Although our team defeated the Singapore Selection with a score of 4-0 last month, everyone believed that the Singapore Selection's strength this year was mediocre, and our victory was not unexpected. Moreover, the victory came too easily, and it was regrettable that they could not see our team's brilliant performance. Therefore, they encouraged the football authorities to select the Army-Navy Combined team to compete against us when our team passed through Singapore again. The Army-Navy Combined team has several strong divisions, selecting the best of the best, making their force even greater. When two heroes meet, they are bound to awaken the fans' senses. The authorities complied with the public's wishes, and the match was held on the 7th (Sunday). For a time, fans from various cities outside of Singapore rushed to get there, traveling long distances. The authorities, mindful of the excessive crowding of fans in the previous match and the difficulty in maintaining order (one fan died from being squeezed), took precautions this time, limiting the capacity to 16,000 people, and refusing entry to anyone over that number. The seriousness of the situation was evident. Afterwards, it was heard that two hours before the start of the match on that day, the stadium was already completely surrounded, demonstrating the great appeal of the match. Our team used the same lineup that defeated the Batavia league leaders 7-2, except for Bao replacing Huang as goalkeeper.</p>
<p>Bao Jiaping, Tan Jiangbai, Li Tiansheng, Chen Zhenhe, Xu Yahui, Liang Rongzhao, Zheng Jiliang, Ye Beihua, Li Huitang, Feng Jingxiang, Cao Guicheng</p>
<p>The first half ended 2-0, with the final score being 4-0. Jingxiang, Guicheng, Beihua, and Huitang each scored once.</p>
<p>The Army-Navy Combined team was strong and powerful, with each player being enormous. Their appearance during practice gave us a great sense of threat. The match started at 5:00 PM. The other side passed the ball immediately upon receiving it, never stopping. This kind of sweeping, hacking strategy made us worry about how to respond for the first fifteen minutes. The opponent's crosses from the wings were accurate, and the center forward was over six feet tall. Their headers on goal were very dangerous. Fortunately, Bao and Tan defended with all their might, preventing a loss. In the 17th minute, Jingxiang received a low pass from Jiliang, scoring the first goal. Guicheng followed up with another goal, making the score 2-0 in the first half. After switching sides, our attack became even more intense. The opposing defenders and goalkeeper were overwhelmed, unable to defend everything. The reporter and Beihua successively scored two more goals, giving four goose eggs to the Army-Navy Combined team, earning unanimous praise from Chinese and foreign spectators. The overseas Chinese were even more delighted. Those who bet on our victory were overjoyed. The power of victory and its effects are truly incredible. Our team used this formation on that day because we considered it our strongest lineup and did not want to change it. Their understanding and coordination are becoming more and more perfect. It is commendable that the defense was able to keep a clean sheet, not conceding a single goal. It was also not easy for the sharp forwards to break through the opponent's tight defense and score four goals. We are even more convinced that this formation is the strongest one we have discovered. We are even more convinced that we must feel satisfied with the measures taken to make the football field soft and level. From the recent performances, it is even more certain that we are soft when we encounter soft, and even harder when we encounter hard.</p>

<h3>Henan Provincial Government Seeks Opportunities for Graduates: Approves Measures for Improving Vocational Education and Internship Opportunities for Graduates</h3>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: The Henan Provincial Government, recognizing that in recent years there has been a large number of Henan and Jiangxi graduates from vocational schools of all levels inside and outside the province, and that their skills are either not being utilized or there are no places to utilize them, which is a great loss to the state's original intention of cultivating talent, has decided to take measures to expand the opportunities for vocational school graduates in order to remedy this situation. The Department of Education was first instructed to draft appropriate measures, and then, together with the Finance Department and the Secretariat, to carefully investigate and revise them. The following are the "Henan Provincial Government's Measures for Improving Vocational Education" and "Henan Provincial Government's Measures for Internship Opportunities for Vocational School Graduates," which were approved at the provincial government meeting on the 16th and promulgated for implementation:</p>
<p>Measures for Improving Vocational Education</p>
<p>The Provincial Government, in order to improve vocational education, cultivate vocational talent, and promote the development of social industries, hereby stipulates these measures. In order to ensure that the facilities and plans of vocational schools meet the needs of social industries in this province and the administrative plans of various departments of this province, the Department of Education shall consult with the various departments to jointly determine them. When various departments and subordinate agencies of this Provincial Government need certain types of talent, they should consult with the Department of Education at any time to establish the relevant vocational schools or add the relevant vocational courses to cultivate them. The various departments and subordinate agencies of this Provincial Government may consult with the Department of Education to unify talent cultivation when organizing various vocational training classes. When various departments and subordinate agencies of this Provincial Government need vocational talent, they may give priority to selecting vocational school graduates or hold public examinations to provide vocational students with equal opportunities. The various departments and subordinate agencies of this Provincial Government may provide internship opportunities for vocational schools to enhance their skills and service capabilities (the internship measures and budget will be determined separately). The various departments and subordinate agencies of this Provincial Government should comply with the orders of the central government and provide vocational schools with practical opportunities to compensate for the lack of school equipment and gain practical experience (the practical measures will be determined separately).

Interns who have registered and passed the review will be assigned to various internships by the provincial government. The review, selection, and assignment of interns will be handled by the Henan Provincial Government's Vocational School Graduates Internship Committee (the committee's regulations will be determined separately). Once an intern has been assigned to an internship institution, they may not request a change of assignment. Internship institutions are limited to the various departments and subordinate agencies of the provincial government. The internship period is six months, but it may be extended or shortened when necessary. Interns should obey the orders of the leaders of the internship institutions, abide by all rules, and serve faithfully. Interns shall not leave their posts without permission. In case of special circumstances, they must submit a request to the leader of the internship institution for approval. Those who leave their posts without approval may have their internships terminated. During the internship period, each intern will be given a monthly living allowance: 8 yuan for junior students, 12 yuan for senior students, and 16 yuan for university students. Those with excellent internship performance may receive a moderate increase. The internship performance will be evaluated by the provincial government, which will issue evaluation methods to the leaders of the internship institutions, who will be responsible for the evaluation and report it for record during the internship period. Upon completion of the internship, interns should prepare an internship report and submit it to the leader of the internship institution for forwarding to the provincial government for record. Interns with particularly outstanding internship performance will be employed by the internship institutions if possible, and will also be kept on file by the provincial government for future use.

<h3>Securities: Public Bonds Show Signs of Disarray Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the last day of the June futures at the Chinese Securities Exchange, and the market was quite chaotic, with the tendency to squeeze becoming more intense. It was not a way to squeeze out the bulls. The environment and situation became increasingly worse. The Guizhou army did not obey the ban and even telegraphed their demands. The Japanese army's free movement in North China aroused anxiety among various groups. The market was stimulated by these unexpected factors, and this month's was really forced to this point, so they had to reluctantly cut or roll over their positions, naturally creating a situation of squeezing the bulls. Today is the Summer Solstice and there is a holiday. After the market opens in August, there will definitely be a new round of changes. Yesterday's events: At the opening in the morning, Dingzhong was the most squeezed, falling sharply by 1.1 yuan this month. Wuzhong was also squeezed by a small 7 jiao.

Although the closing market was still extremely depressed, many retail investors covered their shorts. The forward Jiazhong fell by another 4 jiao. The trend was restricted by the environment, and it was difficult to recover for a while. Except for Jiazhong, the rest of the unified public bonds continued to see new lows, breaking the low price record of June 10. The daily market price fell by 6 jiao, 5 fen to 1 yuan, 5 fen. The total number of transactions was 16,675,000 yuan. The results of the gains and losses are listed in the table below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Overseas Yarn and Cotton Advance Steadily</h3>
<p>The Standard Yarn Situation Becomes More Solid</p>
<p>The yarn market continues to be strong, and the wind of rising prices is gradually rising. Because the world yarn and cotton market is advancing steadily, people are becoming more optimistic. Short positions are covering, and at the same time, raw cotton is strong and expensive, making the yarn market more solid. However, there is still no hope for the development of the current yarn business, and there are still more than 20,000 bales of yarn in stock in the warehouse, so the rising power of the yarn market is still subject to its resistance.</p>
<p>The Standard Yarn Closing Sees a Sudden Increase in Buying Interest: At the opening of the Standard Yarn market in the morning, due to the soaring prices of overseas yarn and cotton, short positions were eager to cover, and the market was full of enthusiasm. The momentum in the first round was tense. All months opened higher, rising by 1 yuan and 6.7 jiao to 2 yuan and 3 jiao. Unexpectedly, after the second round, the bulls took advantage of the rising time and suddenly came out in droves, and the chips were loose and flooded, and the market price turned downstream. As a result, each month rose by 6.7.9 jiao to 1 yuan compared with the closing price of the previous day, but this month rose by 1 yuan and 8 jiao. The afternoon opening was flat, and the news of the spot yarn transaction was unsmooth. The second and third rounds fell by 2.3 jiao. By the time of closing, the news of foreign cotton was better. The Osaka Sanpin yarn rose by 4 yuan this month, and the long-term rose by 1.2 yuan. Buyers gathered, and the market rebounded. As a result, each month rose by 5.6.8 jiao compared with the morning closing price, but this month fell by 3 jiao. It was found that 1,800 bales were sold by Chengji, 1,100 bales by Tongji, 4,000 bales by Daji, 1,600 bales by Jinchang, 1,350 bales by Mingde, 2,650 bales by Shenji, 1,550 bales by Dachangcheng, 1,100 bales by Jinghua, and 2,200 bales by Changfeng.

<h3>Multi-Party Profit Taking Halts Cotton Price Surge</h3>
<p>The cotton market experienced a morning decline followed by an afternoon rise, ultimately resulting in a flat outcome. However, overseas cotton markets in India and America continued their dramatic upward trend.  Due to the large-scale profit-taking by local investors the cotton market has appeared relaxed.  Market prices have reversed downwards.  The bullish investors are abandoning the current month and rolling over to July contracts, suggesting that spot cotton is extremely tight.</p>
<p>**Headline:** Near Month Drops, Far Month Rises</p>
<p>Before the opening of the spot cotton market, American cotton continued to rise by nine to sixteen points, Indian cotton continued its steep upward trend increasing by 2.5 to 3.5 rupees, and Osaka cotton rose by 5.6 sen. Before the market opened, market sentiment was unanimously bullish.  Unexpectedly, a large number of profit-taking investors seized the opportunity to sell, loosening supply and causing the market to reverse downwards. As a result, all months experienced a drop of 3.5 sen compared to the previous day's close, and new cotton fell by 5 sen. After the afternoon opening, because bullish investors continued to take profits, the market appeared weak.  By the third close, it suddenly turned strong, and as the news for American cotton remained optimistic, short sellers also came to cover their positions. The market situation shifted from flat to tight. As a result, all months experienced an increase of 0.5 to 4.5 sen compared to the morning closing price, and new cotton rose by 5 sen to 1 sen, with the exception of the current month falling by 2.5 sen. Sales included Changhe 11,100 bales, Yuanxingchang 5,600 bales, Jinkang 3,500 bales, Yongda 2,000 bales, Shengyuan 2,800 bales, Yuanyi 4,500 bales, Renfeng 2,600 bales, Shenji 5,100 bales, Daji 2,800 bales, Dafu 2,500 bales, and Mingde 4,300 bales.

<h3>Spot Cotton Demand in Bombay Last Week Was Very Strong</h3>
<p>The Bombay cotton market last week, following the rise in overseas markets, triggered some profit-taking. Prices for July and August contracts of Broach cotton were already high, and further increases raised concerns about more investors selling.  The strong momentum previously created by speculators has now aligned with overseas markets. As a result, manufacturers and exporters were prepared to buy, and spot demand was very strong. Japanese merchants were the major buyers. Monsoon rains were active, and some cotton-growing areas benefited from the rain. The following is a summary of last week's statistics (in thousands of bales):</p>

<p>Yesterday's flour market was suspended in the morning because the June margin calls had not been fully settled. By the afternoon, the June issue had been resolved. It was reported that after mediation by guarantors, settlement occurred, with an approximate settlement price of 3.42 yuan, or a reported seller's price of 4.7 sen. Therefore, although the market opened in the afternoon, June contracts were not re-traded. For the far-month contracts, although foreign wheat was quoted up by 4-5 sen, as much as 7-8 sen or 1 yuan, recent new wheat prices have been stable and volumes have reached 20-30 thousand bales. As a result, near-term opening prices were slightly lower. November, however, remained as stable as usual. After the second session, strong buying interest from non-industry participants boosted market sentiment and prices rose steadily. The previous month's experience served as a reminder, and everyone remained cautious, which helped market sentiment.</p>
<h3>Futures Wheat Soars in the Far Term, Declines in the Near Term</h3>
<p>Spot Arrivals Gradually Increase; Prices Decline Slightly</p>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market opened in the morning with opening prices declining by 2-3 sen due to strong arrivals of new wheat and a sense of stability. Later, prices gradually rose due to active short covering. By the afternoon opening, the June market was stable as usual. Far-term contracts, however, improved by 2-4 sen due to the rebounding flour market and attention to two consecutive days of foreign wheat price increases. Spot wheat prices remained stable, but as arrivals increased, trading lacked aggressiveness. Chinese traders slightly reduced prices. Chen wheat from Yaowan opened at 4.48 yuan, Shaobo wheat at 4.2 yuan, Changshu wheat at 4.07 yuan or 4.05 yuan, Taipingqiao wheat at 4.16 yuan, Bacheng wheat at 3.8 yuan, Danyang wheat at 4.15 yuan, and Suzhou wheat at 4.17 yuan or 4 yuan, with 7,000 bales handled by Fuxin.</p>
<h3>Soybean Oilcake Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>New Rapeseed Has Price But No Market</p>
<p>The soybean oilcake market continues to rise strongly. Prices reached another ceiling. Soybean oil rose by 0.3 yuan, with 490 deals completed. Peanut oil rose by 0.3-0.4 yuan, with 500 deals completed. Soybean cake rose by 0.03-0.04 yuan, with over 13,000 deals completed. Yellow soybeans continued to tighten by 0.04-0.05 yuan. However, social bean sand yellow softened due to oversupply. The destination of oil extraction was Siping Street, with 10 truckloads of beans handled by the oil extraction companies. The Xiamen gang purchased one truckload of Harbin beans and 200 bales of sand yellow. Only 160 bales of social beans were traded on the street. New rapeseed prices are higher than the market, making transportation unprofitable, and the supply is cut off, resulting in price with no market (a few thousand bales arrived, but were transferred by the Japanese gang for their own account). Yesterday, it was rumored that 155 bales of cargo from Jiujiang were handled by Wenzhou merchants at a price of 6.43 yuan. The accuracy of this report requires verification.</p>
<h3>River Rice Sales Remain Sluggish</h3>
<p>Today, North and South Rice Markets are Closed for the Dragon Boat Festival</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Daily arrivals from various gangs totaled only 2,400-2,500 dan on the 12th and 13th. Due to the Dragon Boat Festival, sales in this street remained sluggish. Only the Dalian gang purchased over 500 bales. As a result, the market situation was stable. Thick japonica early rice and thin rice prices were stable. Du Yangjian and Yin Bian Yuan were similar. Today is the end of the Dragon Boat Festival period, and the South Shanghai rice market will be closed for one day.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, arrivals from various routes in Hexia totaled the 12th and 13th. Sales of white japonica rice were flat in the morning, and prices remained stable. Later, due to firm sales and improved purchasing interest, market prices increased by about 0.1 yuan for medium-quality rice at the close. White Yuan continued to have some demand and price increased by almost 0.1 yuan. Sales of thin rice were weak and prices were high and stable. However medium quality rice fell slightly. Indica rice and other goods all had firm prices. Today is the traditional Dragon Boat Festival, and the market is closed for one day.</p>
<h3>Passenger Indica Market Also Seeing Gradual Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, passenger indica rice continued to arrive in the hinterland from ports such as the Yangtze River, and due to the approach of the end of the festival, debtors were keen to do business. However, purchases by inland traders suddenly increased, and trading was even more intense. This street also saw inquiries. In addition to handling passenger indica rice, this street also shipped 830 bales of small-sized rice. As a result, the prices of all types of rice have risen quietly. Although passenger indica prices are similar to the previous market, market sentiment has risen quietly by 0.03-0.05 yuan, and small-sized rice prices have gradually risen by 0.2 yuan. Currently, inland demand is still strong, and the market may need to improve again. Total sales included 3,829 bales of Jiangxi rice, 930 bales of Taiwanese rice, 900 bales of Shashi rough rice, and 1,800 bales of Jiangbei rough rice, most of which were purchased by inland traders.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods</h3>
<p>Manipulating Fabrics at the Japanese Spinning Mills</p>
<p>More Than 2,000 Pieces Traded on This Street</p>
<p>The recent sharp rise in the cotton market is due to the sharp rise in foreign cotton. The uneasy domestic situation and hoarding also boosted this trend. Japanese spinning mills have raised prices sharply. Buyers are still keen. Chinese spinning mills and cloth factories followed suit, causing huge surges, with jumps of 0.4-0.5 yuan per piece in three or four days. The prices of our factories are more moderate, but they have also risen by 0.2-0.3 yuan per piece. Yesterday, sentiment was even higher, with asking prices rising another 0.1 yuan compared to the previous week. Factory prices are even further from market prices, and most do not have accurate market prices. Colored fabrics, bleached fabrics, and foreign yarns have all risen by 0.2-0.3 yuan per piece. The market for patterned fabrics has already risen, but market prices are still flat. Purchases from various gangs are good. Wholesale shops and dyeing factories in this street were the most enthusiastic, handling over 2,000 pieces of white goods, fine cloth, coarse cloth, fine twill, plain colors, straight goods, patterned cloth, floral linen yarn, poplin, and foreign yarn. Customers from inland areas and along the Yangtze River, as well as Shanxi and Shaanxi, increased their purchases and transactions were very strong. Internal and external advances have become more intense. Most customers are looking for opportunities to make profits. Factory deliveries are becoming more frequent.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Local Silk Prices Remain Largely Unchanged</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Yokohama silk market rose slightly compared to last Saturday. Spot prices opened at 692 yuan, up 2 yuan, while futures were at 710 yuan, up 10 yuan. New York was closed yesterday due to the weekend, and there were no changes in the Lyon silk market. There were slight transactions in the local silk market yesterday. Dachang, Xinfu and other firms saw some interest in white factory silk. English firms are also active. Jardine Matheson purchased 100 bales. Silk prices remain unchanged.</p>
<h3>More Smuggled Goods Arrive at Customs Auction; Prices of Tianqiao Brand Artificial Silk Plummet</h3>
<p>The price of No. 120 Tianqiao brand rayon has fallen by more than 10 yuan due to the arrival of over 200 boxes of goods seized by North China Customs at the auction, priced at 395 yuan. Those that cannot be shipped to the mainland are priced at over 390 yuan. Dozens of boxes have been traded. Trade in European goods has decreased due to the upcoming Dragon Boat Festival. The goods sold at auction by Nanjing Customs this time totaled eight boxes and four small packages, all No. 120 Tianqiao brand, purchased by local Digital at a price of 340 yuan.</p>
<h3>Qimen Flower Scent is Widely Sold in Europe</h3>
<p>Zhenmei Green Tea Has Firm Price and Strong Sales</p>
<p>Qimen flower-scented black tea has been actively sought by English firms Jardine Matheson, Jinlong, and Tianyu in the past two days. It is reported that Russian firms are also negotiating large volumes with the Anhui and Jiangxi Red Flower General Sales Office, and sales are quite extensive. As for Qifu black tea, over 2,000 boxes were traded yesterday, mostly in the second and third batches, priced at 50 yuan to 80-90 yuan, with prices showing an upward trend. In the green tea market, Tunxi high-grade goods are still the best. Yesterday, over 2,000 boxes of Tunzhen were traded, priced from 82 yuan to 91 yuan. Hundreds of boxes of Wuyuan Dongxiang Zhenmei were traded, priced from 88 yuan to 93 yuan. Several hundred boxes of Suizhen were sold, priced from 70 yuan to 73 yuan. Jardine Matheson and Jinlong were the main buyers. It can be said that the green tea market is characterized by firm prices and strong sales. After considerable movement last week, trading in Shui Zhu tea was suspended by various firms yesterday. Only major firms continued to trade, with Jinlong handling Guose Xiang at 35.5 yuan and Huacha handling Meili at 43.5 yuan. Wholesale prices are similar to those before.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Re-exported Foreign Sugar Shows Slight Decline</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market trend was soft. The association's price for No. 24 coarse white spot sugar was 22.1 yuan, but no transaction occurred. Re-exported sugar fell by 0.05 yuan and was traded at 6.8 yuan. Dongbai No. 489 spot sugar was priced at the original price, while re-exported No. 4 sugar fell by 0.02 yuan to 7.08 yuan, No. 8 fell by 0.05 yuan to 6.75 yuan, and No. 9 YRO mark was unchanged at 6.4 yuan. The local factory's Zhenji No. 1 refined white sugar was 20.4 yuan, Dahua Jinxin No. 1 was 20.5 yuan, and the rest were sold as usual. There was a batch of refined red sugar opened by the Chaozhou gang, with higher prices such as Zhengfeng red at 12.55 yuan, and Hongxing Ruiji  Yuanji, Hexing, etc. at 12 yuan, and subcontracted red at 11.5 to 10.8 yuan, totaling over 430 packages. Additionally, over 100 packages of Hainan red were at 11.4 yuan, up by 0.1 yuan.</p>
<p>At the company's first weekly tender auction yesterday, the total quota for Guangdong coarse white sugar was 9,657 packages, with no change in tender prices.

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Fang Zheng)</p>
<p>If we were to compare the love of young people to white sugar and plums, that would be most appropriate. However, many young people refuse to eat plums one after another. They only know that when they experience a broken heart, they commit suicide, jump into the river, and do all sorts of shocking and tragic things. They do not know their own value, which is ten thousand times greater than a plum! Friends who are heartbroken! Please think twice before you act.</p>
<p>Although love is an indispensable process during youth, one must not become obsessed with it. Because many promising young people have an enterprising spirit in whatever career they pursue before they fall in love. Once they have a lover, they not only stop seeking career advancement, but also indulge in pink dreams all day long, and their ambitions decline. It is truly lamentable! Therefore, love can easily affect our future. May all young people in the world pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>About the Grand View Garden Model</h3>
<p>— Ya Chang</p>
<p>Ms. Yang Lingfu's handmade model of the Grand View Garden in the Summer Palace is exquisite and natural. All the pavilions, terraces, winding railings, and rooms, the rugged rocks, the lush vegetation, and the garden scenery are all lifelike, making people yearn for it as if they were there. Ms. Yang is truly a person with unique ingenuity. Ms. Yang began working on the Grand View Garden model when she was in her teens. After the Grand View Garden model was completed in 1919, she took it to various places for public exhibition. At that time, Ms. Yang wrote an article about the Grand View Garden model, narrating its construction from beginning to end. I recently found this article in old notes while sorting through my belongings, so I transcribed it here to enrich Spring and Autumn.</p>
<p>"When I made the Grand View Garden, I had never read the entire Dream of the Red Chamber. When I was eight or nine years old, I loved the Six Principles of Painting but had no teacher. I heard people say that learning to paint must start with boundary painting. Li Chengqiu of the Song Dynasty and Qiu Shifu of the Ming Dynasty were masters of exquisite buildings, and no one has succeeded them since. There happened to be a complete map of the Grand View Garden on the wall, so I copied it day and night. However, my love for architecture is even greater than my love for painting. Even during times of chaos and hasty escape, I always carried my tools with me. In my spare time from reading, I built small houses with diligence. In 1919, I took out what I had made over the years and kept the best ones, getting five or six kinds of pavilions and terraces. I wanted to build a garden, but I had no drawings, so I imitated the Grand View Garden that I had copied as a child. At that time, I knew the origins of the Grand View Garden from the Dream of the Red Chamber. Dream of the Red Chamber is a masterpiece of fiction. Since I built this garden, I had to match it with the origins of the garden, so I read Dream of the Red Chamber. After reading it, I greatly regretted it, saying: the people in Dream of the Red Chamber are all people I have often seen. Young masters from relatives like Jia Baoyu are abundant. There are many young ladies in the world who are depressed and suffering like Lin Daiyu. The other people are opportunistic and despicable, people whom I avoid whenever possible. So there is nothing to take from the people or the events. The only thing to take is their writing style. Why would I plan it and build it, to build a palace for those people? That is really devoting too much effort. Since my garden mistakenly uses the name of the Grand View Garden, people will definitely say that I am deeply familiar with the Redology and worship its book, so I narrate its origins like this."</p>
<h3>Shiyu Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>Shiyu (shad) is available in late spring and early summer, not at other times, so it was originally called "Shiyu" (seasonal fish). People added a radical to the character for fish to specialize it, but it is actually a vulgar character. This fish has an elegant and flat shape, similar to bream but longer. It is no more than three feet long, and its scales dazzle the eye. When it first comes out of the water, it is as white as silver, different from ordinary fish. According to the fishermen, "When the fish are caught in a net, all the other fish jump and try to escape, but this fish is silent and motionless, for fear of damaging its scales." And those who love to eat it also value its fat in the scales, so when steamed, they consider the scales the supreme delicacy.</p>
<p>But the flesh has many thorns, as fine as hair, so the ancients listed it as one of the five regrets. The so-called "I know to love myself, only the scales are good, difficult to satisfy with sentiment are the many thorns," is not false. However, reciting "Do not hate the skinny bones that are difficult to search, it is okay to chew with the silver scales," is for those who know the taste to appreciate, and a boor chewing with a full mouth, resulting in a bone stuck in the throat, unable to spit it out or stay easy, is not the fault of the fish, but the fault of not knowing how to eat it. Because its rich texture is in the scales, it is suitable for clear stewing, which melts when heated, and the soup is unparalleled, so it is a delicacy of early summer, which lies in this.</p>
<p>It spawns between fresh water and sea water, with Fuchun River in Zhejiang being the most famous. Jiangyin, Jiangsu, is also quite famous. When it first enters the market, its price is extremely high. In my county, it comes from Shidong in Songjiang. This year, it was seen in the market close to the Start of Summer, which can be said to be the latest. But its value is still expensive, and only the wealthy and those with a gluttonous addiction dare to inquire about it. The other day, a certain family had a wedding banquet with this dish, bought from Shanghai to treat the guests, but the waiters did not recognize it. By the time the guests had finished eating and the plate was brought up, many had not had a chance to taste it. This has become a talking point, adding a new record to the humorous history of eating "Shiyu."</p>
<h3>When the Pomegranate Flowers Bloom</h3>
<p>— Zhou Qifeng</p>
<p>The pomegranate flowers are blooming,</p>
<p>Blooming so brightly and brilliantly, like fire.</p>
<p>One, two, three plants are connected, the flowers are so many and so red, densely crowded together, looking from a distance, like a large red satin unfurled in the sky.</p>
<p>The early summer wind, lazy and drunk, as if mixed with a lot of alcohol, sweeps through the city, sweeps through the fields, sweeps through the fiery pomegranate flowers, sweeps through the scattered couples of men and women under the pomegranate flowers.</p>
<p>Frenzied laughter, whispered sweet nothings, sweet songs, intertwined with the fragrance of powder, light cheongsam corners, men's pointed-toe leather shoes, constitute a sketch of modern bourgeois youth life. No pain, no sorrow, no worry, the world seems to exist for them, the pomegranate flowers seem to bloom for them.</p>
<p>The man is always humble, always reciting like a formula:</p>
<p>"Darling, you are the driving force of my life, without you, I cannot live... Yes, everything I have belongs to you, every cell, every..."</p>
<p>The woman pouted as usual, looking impatient, and after the man had rambled on for a long time, she turned her head slightly and blurted out three words:</p>
<p>"How annoying!"</p>
<p>However, in the woman's heart, there was no response of "How annoying," she was still the "driving force" of the man's life. Under the pomegranate flowers, everyone smoothly completed their own romance.</p>
<p>The pomegranate flowers are blooming,</p>
<p>Blooming so brightly and brilliantly, like fire! But it cannot awaken the numb hearts of pleasure-seekers!</p>
<h3>Zongzi</h3>
<p>— Ou</p>
<p>The weather is so sultry. It's hard to even breathe in the house, and sweat flows like tree sap, sticking to all our clothes, as if we've grown another layer of skin. The children are all irritable. Only mother is an exception. This kind of humid weather seems to have no effect on her at all. She's still running around in the front and back yards as usual, helping the old maid who has been with our family for fourteen years with all the housework. When she gets tired, she'll at most pick up a cup of cold tea and take a sip, then rush off to do things again.</p>
<p>The day after my ninth brother and I put on our bamboo cloth gowns, Grandfather sent someone from the shop with two baskets of loquats (we didn't know at the time if they were red-fleshed or white-fleshed). After we had eaten one basket by robbing, stealing, and deceiving, we suddenly thought of the zongzi that we always had every year, and we thought that zongzi should be eaten at the same time as loquats. So, regardless of how busy Mother was, we kept pestering her to make zongzi. That year, Grandmother happened to be sick in bed, and besides managing the household affairs as usual, Mother also had to take care of Grandmother's medicine, so she was really busy enough. In addition, the old maid who had been with our family for fourteen years walked slowly, and it always took her more than an hour to come back every time she went to the street. She went to the street three times a day, so she spent most of her time on the street, leaving only Mother to be busy at home.</p>
<p>But she was determined not to deprive us of our right to eat zongzi this year. She finally took the time out of her busy schedule to wrap many meat zongzi and red bean paste zongzi for us. Of course, she didn't have time during the day, so she wrapped these zongzi late into the night. When we got up the next morning and rushed to ask the old maid to unwrap the zongzi for us to eat, Mother sat lazily on a bamboo chair, watching us with a bitter smile. The old maid asked her if she wanted her to unwrap one for her too, but she just shook her head. After we walked out the door with our schoolbags, I seemed to hear Mother vomiting. Ninth Brother didn't understand and whispered to me, "Mother must have eaten too many zongzi last night." I was a few years older than him, and although I knew that his guess was wrong, I couldn't imagine how hard she had worked for us.</p>
<p>When I came home at noon, Mother's neck was covered with red, black scraped marks, and she hadn't even eaten yet. When Ninth Brother saw that half of the zongzi basket was gone (it had been taken to give away), he wanted to lose his temper, but I quickly held him back.</p>
<p>This was already eighteen or nineteen years ago, but every time I eat zongzi around the Dragon Boat Festival, it is bound to reappear on the screen of my mind.</p>
<p>The Fallen Flowers of Yingzhou, a recent work by the seaside fisherman, with profound meaning, has been widely distributed. Thank you for sending me a copy from Shanghai Shandong Road Social Book Bureau.</p>
<h3>A New Couple</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 3: The Rain and Wind Still Leave Traces; The Night is Quiet and the Heart Pens a Letter of Severance</p>
<p>Miss Jiang was not as shockingly surprised as the last time I saw her. She slowly walked to my side, a faint smile appearing on her face. This faint smile could only be discerned from the slight movement of the corners of her mouth and the slight shift of her dark eyes. When she was more than ten paces away, she was always slightly lowering her head, waiting until she was within ten paces, then she would lower her eyelids. In this process of the faint smile, I had one of my clearest understandings, and I even raised my hand to take off my hat and salute her. But when my hand reached the brim of my hat, I felt a bit reckless, and I did not have the courage to take off my hat, so I lowered my hand again. But when I was touching the brim of my hat, a faint smile was also faintly revealed on my face. The other person saw this faint smile, and she accepted my gesture in a very calm manner, and did not think that my action was out of the ordinary. After this encounter, if I were five years younger, I would have jumped a few times in the alley. Now, although it was inconvenient to jump up, I felt that my steps were much lighter. With these opportunities, I released the irrepressible emotions in my heart. The second time, she very clearly sent a faint smile to me. She was already within a pace of me, and although she saw it very clearly, she was not shy in the least. She glanced at me quickly, and then lowered her head and left. The third time, I had some courage, and I still raised my hand and touched the brim of my hat, as if I were about to nod my head. Miss Jiang's faint smile also changed a bit under such social circumstances. When it flickered at the corners of her mouth, it already revealed two rows of neat white teeth. It was clear that she was smiling deeply. About two days passed with this touching of the hat brim in salute and a deep smile in response. My mother, Mrs. Zhang, was a little surprised. When I went to eat lunch with her, Mrs. Zhang looked at my face and asked, "Child, have you been preoccupied these past few days?" I lowered my head and ate, answering, "No." Mrs. Zhang said, "That can't be. When you are home, you are either writing or reading. These past few days, when you go to school, you are always looking at your watch, afraid of being late. When you come home, you seem to have found something valuable, and your face is full of smiles. But you can't sit still, you are just wandering around in the study, and lying in bed, as if there is a happy thing that you can't settle down with. Today is Sunday, you don't have to go to teach. But you are still often looking at your watch, and you run out in a hurry. After you run out, you come back smiling." I laughed, "Mom is asking about this matter. This matter is indeed ridiculous. I forgot that today was Sunday, and I hurried to school. When I got there, I saw that there was no one there, and I realized that it was Sunday, so I came back smiling." (38)</p>
<p>Wanderings</p>
<h3>From Slender West Lake to Four Five Six</h3>
<p>— Ai Mei</p>
<p>Wandering for several years, my footsteps have not yet left the province of Jiangsu; moreover, the places I've been to are either bustling metropolises or impoverished backwaters like living hells. If I were to reluctantly name a scenic spot that's more worthy of my longing, it would only be the Slender West Lake in Yangzhou. However, I've been separated from it for two years now! Truly: My body is covered in the dust of the world, I'm ashamed to say!</p>
<p>This trip to Yangzhou had two purposes: — First, of course, was to explore the beauty of the long-missed Slender West Lake; Second, was to visit the renowned Women's Life Class attached to the Provincial Yangzhou Middle School, which I had long heard of. Unfortunately, with only three nights, I was constantly attending gatherings, how annoying! Fortunately, the second day's gathering, besides the meal, included a lake tour, so I didn't entirely waste the trip; but I ultimately failed to visit the Women's Life Class, which is indeed a regret of this trip.</p>
<p>It was a clear and sunny afternoon, and I, along with Zhou and Zhu, strolled out of the North Gate, heading towards the lake. Along the way, a gentle breeze caressed our faces, and the bright sun enveloped us; truly! In this time of late spring and early summer, the afternoon weather was indeed very comfortable.</p>
<p>Upon reaching Green Willow Village, we were surrounded by boatmen; but the famed boat girls were nowhere to be seen. This was naturally because we were too late. We looked at the sky and realized it was indeed late, so we decided to visit only Little Gold Mountain and Xu Garden. As the ancients said, "Whether climbing mountains or crossing water, one must always leave some places unvisited, so as to allow for longing; otherwise, I would feel that my interest has been exhausted." We were very convinced by this famous saying. So, we boarded the boat we had hired. — Speaking of the boat, it was very simple, with only a white cloth awning on top and three rattan chairs below, barely enough to accommodate us!</p>
<p>With a punt pushing off from the lake's edge, we were now floating in the green waves; the setting sun reflected in the water, moving with the ripples, refracting into countless tiny rays of light, truly a dazzling display of gold and green. We lay back in the rattan chairs, gazing at the surrounding scenery, and our hearts instantly felt relieved, as if we had shed ten thousand bushels of worldly dust.</p>
<p>We chatted casually, and Zhu casually asked me, "How many times have you been here? When was the first time?" I said:</p>
<p>"I can't remember how many times I've been here; but mentioning the first time is quite emotional. It was when I was six or seven years old, living in Yangzhou, and I came with my late father; even though I was a child, I knew how to appreciate the scenery, and I kept asking my father to come, or I would cry; I remember one time, I cried myself to sleep, and when I woke up the next morning, I still clamored for my father, so he哄哄me by saying: He had taken me there last night, but I was sleeping too soundly to wake up; children are children after all, and I actually believed it; but this was also because I had just dreamed of visiting the place." Zhou and Zhu both laughed. But I felt a pang in my heart, and suddenly everything before me became a sad place I couldn't bear to look back on!</p>
<p>The scenery of Little Gold Mountain and Xu Garden remained as before, without any renovation; we each strolled around for a while, and then took a group photo in Xu Garden. It was already dusk, with only a wisp of sunset hanging far on the treetops, and it was clear that night was about to fall. After leaving the garden, we also went to see the newly rebuilt Five Pavilion Bridge, which was indeed ornately carved and brand new; we gazed at it briefly and then set sail back.</p>
<p>Amidst the lights of thousands of homes, we entered the city together and arrived at the Four Five Six Restaurant on Xinsheng Street. There, they have a very famous dish, which is braised carp, especially the braised fish head. We went for dinner just to try this dish. When we ate it, it was indeed well-deserved, just the fish head alone was more than a foot long, covered in fish oil, and cooked to be incredibly tender; eating carp in other places, I had never tasted such a flavor.</p>
<p>Upon parting, Zhu invited me and Zhou: "Let's come to Yangzhou again during the Mid-Autumn Festival, so we can take advantage of the full moon to enjoy a night cruise on the lake; or perhaps next New Year, to explore the plum blossoms at Shi Kefa Shrine." He said, "There are too many places we didn't get to today! Besides the ones we've been to before, there's also the newly built Xiong Garden! By the Mid-Autumn Festival, it should be completed, adding another scenic spot for us to enjoy." At this time, I suddenly remembered the Fifth Spring of Ping Shan Hall, which I had visited several times before, but had completely forgotten to drink the spring water; so I told Zhu, but Zhu said, "The spring water? Don't mention it! The spring has been silted up for almost two years!" This made me feel lost for a long time, and I felt that it had added another regret to my life!</p>

<h3>Difficulties and Remedies in Rural Health Work</h3>
<p>— Ji Bufeng</p>
<p>I've been wandering in Xishan, Jiangxi, and although I've only been serving for a few months, I can't fully understand the situation in rural areas; but I grew up in a rural village in Zhejiang, and after graduating from school, I was also trying to make a living in rural areas. According to what I've personally seen about the current state of rural health, it's probably the same. I dare to talk about my personal shallow views below:</p>
<p>All social construction is based on economics. No matter what item you talk about, you can't do without economics first. Now, rural economic bankruptcy has reached an acute stage. Revitalizing the rural economy is impossible for us little guys working in rural health. There are naturally big people to take on this major responsibility. I can't talk about it, and I won't talk about it; however, in rural health work, we have to consider the current state of the rural economy, choose what is possible for the rural economy, is simple and easy to implement, and is practical, and first guide the farmers to do it, so that everyone can do it and enjoy it, and the results are relatively good. Otherwise, using Westernized ideas to plan various sanitation projects, shutting ourselves up and building carts, is not suitable for use. The results are all impassable, equivalent to a mere formality, only filling the report form nicely, deceiving ourselves.</p>
<p>"It is easier to change mountains and rivers than to alter one's character." These two sentences are not wrong at all. I see that there are many things that farmers can do, but they just don't do them. It's all because it's difficult to change their habits. For example, cleaning the house is quite easy to do, but they just let the dust fill the room and chicken manure cover the ground, and they don't care. They live, eat, and sleep inside and don't feel any discomfort at all. Forming this bad habit was caused by the old society for thousands of years. Improving this bad habit cannot be accomplished in a day or two. We can only adopt a gradual approach, taking the opportunity to promote it. Never be too hasty, otherwise, it will damage the relationship with the farmers: The best way to develop good hygiene habits is to start with children. Now, each Bao school wants to implement a compulsory school system. Each Bao school's children are the entire number of rural children. We should organize a Rural Health Education Committee to promote rural school health so that all children can develop hygiene habits. Schools are group institutions, and it is much more convenient for us to guide them. We can also teach them to do various health promotions, and we can get great help in health education.</p>
<p>Farmers lack scientific knowledge and have little faith in hygiene. Even if we explain the benefits of hygiene in great detail, and say it eloquently, they always listen carefully but disregard it. It is impossible to make a stubborn stone nod. How can we make farmers have faith in hygiene? According to my experience, the best way is to start with treatment. The important mission of rural health work should be to prevent disease, not to treat it, but the main opinion of the farmers is the opposite. They value treatment and despise hygiene. For example, someone in Bao 107 was shot twice, and a woman in Bao 80 committed suicide with scissors, stabbing her throat to a depth of about an inch. After I healed them, they believed that the new medicine was better. After that, it was much smoother for me to work in these two Baos than in other Baos.</p>
<p>Farmers deeply believe in superstition, and all disasters are left to fate. To plant smallpox vaccines, they set up altars to worship the Goddess of Smallpox. When they get sick, they pray in front of the gods for healing. They don't understand the cause of the disease at all. If there is an infectious disease, it is even more pitiful and ridiculous. Those who are sick don't know what infection is and spread it at will, and those who are not sick don't know what infection is and contact it at will, which is bound to spread it greatly. When people are dying everywhere and coffins are in short supply, they can only ask monks and Taoists to draw talismans and perform rituals. It is really a major obstacle to health work. To break superstition and promote hygiene, we must tell the patients face to face when we visit them every day how the disease occurred, what dangers there are, what is the reasonable treatment, and how to prevent it from happening. In addition, we must have the determination to work hard and without complaint, regardless of whether the farmers blame us for offending the gods or scold us to our faces, we must do our best to break superstition, and sometimes we must use political power to prohibit it.</p>
<p>Farmers are ignorant and always regard us as people of another class. Either they underestimate themselves too much and dare not meet us, or they have a suspicious and fearful mentality, fearing that we want to think about money, collect taxes, and send donations, and avoid meeting us. When I first went to each Bao to visit and talk to them, some answered "Yes, yes." to deal with us with perfunctory means, some immediately avoided us, and even when asked where the Bao chief lived, they pretended not to know and refused to tell the truth. Later, after many visits, I gradually became familiar with them and realized that I had no improper demands on them, and then I had the opportunity to talk to them. Because we have a low level of knowledge among the farmers, creating a superior position, promoting work, using this superior position, or political power, and forcing them to do it, may be feasible for a while, but the effect will be lost as soon as the pressure is gone. Not only is it a temporary昙花-like achievement, but it often creates an obstacle to the relationship with the farmers and adds a difficulty to the work. We want to know how health work can penetrate into rural areas, how it can exist permanently, and when we are working in rural health, our attitude should be gentle, our words should be sincere, and it is a way to remedy difficulties in our work.</p>
<p>I recently attended the Rural Health Instructor Conference and listened to reports from various places, and many of the difficulties in the work came from the same workers. We are all the frontline workers in the right rural areas, and such things have happened, which is shameful and disgraceful. Although the organization in each place is divided into health groups, agricultural groups, household affairs groups, cooperative groups, and education groups, each is separated, but in fact, it is the entire rural undertaking. We should broaden our horizons, put the undertaking first, cooperate with each other, and use the spirit of mutual assistance to make the groups work together. The various difficulties mentioned above can be easily broken, and the work can be advanced. It is not only the luck of health work, but also the benefit of each group.</p>
<h3>Causes and Treatment of Insomnia</h3>
<p>— Translated by Zifu</p>
<p>In order to maintain their lives and engage in activity, humans must have a certain amount of time for wakefulness and sleep to alternate with each other. That is to say, after a certain period of activity, activity must be stopped in order to eliminate fatigue and restore physical strength. That is sleep. If sleep is uncomfortable or impaired, then a person's ability to live will be greatly reduced. If sleep is hindered to the extreme, it will be difficult to even maintain life. Therefore, a healthy person has a very regular alternation of day and night, that is to say, a very regular alternation of sleep and wakefulness, in order to smoothly maintain his life and activity.</p>
<p>So, how much sleep does a so-called healthy person need every day? It can be said that this varies from person to person. Generally speaking, young children need a longer period of sleep, and then as they grow up, the amount of sleep gradually decreases.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, young children need from ten to twelve hours of sleep each day; adults need from seven to eight hours; and the elderly need less time.</p>
<p>If we carefully observe the sleep state of a healthy person, we can discover that the depth of sleep undergoes various forms of change over different periods of time. The deepest sleep is one to two hours after falling asleep, after which it gradually becomes shallower, and then near dawn, it enters a slightly deeper sleep state again. This is one type. Another type is that the deepest sleep is two to three hours after falling asleep, and after continuing for a short time, it gradually becomes shallower, and near dawn, one wakes up.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, in a healthy state, the onset of sleep is at a certain time. From this, one can rest and recover from fatigue in order to continue future activities. However, if sleep is impaired in a certain disease state, then insomnia occurs.</p>
<p>In insomnia, one type is that it is difficult to fall asleep after lying in bed; another type is that the state of falling asleep is relatively good, but one feels very tired when waking up in the morning; and another type is that one sleeps very lightly at night and wakes up frequently. In addition, there is a mixed type in which it is not easy to fall asleep, and sleep is very light and easy to wake up, and one is extremely tired when getting up in the morning. Before discussing how to deal with insomnia, we must carefully observe the type of insomnia.</p>
<p>There are various causes of insomnia. For example, diseases of the brain, mental illness, poisoning from various drugs or toxins, the pain or pain of other diseases in the body, severe coughing and wheezing, gastrointestinal disorders, urinary disorders!……etc., all have the potential to cause insomnia. However, strictly speaking, so-called insomnia should be a condition in which insomnia is the main and only symptom. This symptom is often influenced by mental excitement. Especially in young and middle-aged people, this is the most common cause of insomnia. Also, it is caused by mental fatigue, such as insomnia in neurotic people. However, one thing should be noted here is that often some causes are the same, but the reactions they cause in each person are very different. For example, some minor events are not enough to cause insomnia in some people; but in others, they can cause extreme mental excitement, resulting in insomnia. Since the reactions caused by events are so different for each person, the causes of insomnia are naturally not easy to define in general. We can only carefully examine each person to find out the cause and seek a way to deal with it.</p>
<p>The causes of mental excitement include mental fatigue, depression, worry, self-blame, disappointment, fear, grief… etc. The most important of these are fear, depression, and worry. For example, students prepare desperately for exams and study until late at night. As a result, when they go to bed, they still have residual mental excitement, which can greatly interfere with falling asleep.</p>
<p>However, if one studies without reaching the point of mental fatigue, of course, the above situation will not occur. However, if various worries and fears are added to it, it can also become an important cause of insomnia.</p>
<p>The first step in dealing with insomnia is to remove the causes of mental excitement as much as possible. Try to resolve family disputes, job dissatisfaction, and business failures that can lead to fear, depression, anxiety, self-blame, grief, and disappointment. It is true that it is not easy to solve such great difficulties by relying on the parties alone. Therefore, the help of everyone around is indispensable.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, most people with insomnia are neurotic. For these people, even minor events can become a cause of insomnia, so it is best to avoid stimulants as much as possible. At the same time, the temperature of the bedroom should be appropriate, the air circulation should be good, sounds and money should be avoided as much as possible, dinner should not be too full, and tea, coffee, and wine should not be drunk at night. Regular urination and defecation and a fixed bedtime are all very important. All of this should be given deep attention. In addition, we must try our best to avoid mental fatigue at night. Especially for students, even when they are very busy, they should avoid overworking themselves. They must stop for a certain amount of time and rest a little before going to bed.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when the neurasthenia or fatigue reaches a deeper level, it is best to leave the job temporarily and go to a quieter place to recuperate. However, in this case, the coast and high mountains are not suitable. Because there are many things that can cause insomnia in those places. However, if there is no way to change the location to recuperate and leave the job, then one has to set a certain amount of rest time during the day or engage in drawing. It is also very beneficial to do outdoor gymnastics during the day.</p>
<p>Any continuous, mild, and monotonous stimulus, such as listening to monotonous and gentle music, counting numbers, counting breaths, etc., can help sleep. Similarly, mild electrical friction or artificial friction on the whole body can also help sleep.</p>
<p>Bathing in lukewarm water for a long time is also effective for helping sleep. If electrical friction or artificial massage can be continued after bathing, it is even better. Also, after soaking in warm water, wrap the whole body in a dry towel, and then wrap a towel around it, and rest for about thirty minutes to calm the mind, which is also very conducive to sleep.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>Finally, let's talk about sleeping pills. If it is possible not to use them, it is best not to use them, and to try to help sleep with other methods. If it is absolutely necessary to use them, then if they are slightly effective after taking them, they can be discarded immediately and other methods can be used. Also, when taking sleeping pills, you should use drugs with the least side effects. It is best to take a small amount. Moreover, the types of drugs should be changed frequently. It is not very wise for people to purchase certain drugs on hand and take them at will. Because doing so, on the one hand, one is accustomed to using one drug, so one needs to gradually increase the dosage, eventually leading to poisoning; on the other hand, one is accustomed to relying on drugs, and in the future, one may not be able to sleep without drugs. Therefore, one must first be guided by a doctor before taking them.</p>
<p>Among sleeping pills, one type takes effect quickly and the drug's power disappears early; another type takes effect late and the drug's power lasts longer. For people who have difficulty falling asleep, it is advisable to use the former; for people who sleep lightly and are easy to wake up early, it is better to use the latter. For mixed-type insomnia, it is reasonable to use these two drugs in combination. However, this must be handled by a doctor, and it is easiest to make a big mistake if ordinary people mix them at will.</p>
<p>Also, sleeping pills must be taken according to the time and method specified by the doctor. Impatient people take it immediately when they cannot fall asleep at night. This not only has no effect, but also often brings various uncomfortable side effects the next morning.</p>
<p>In short, it is the most foolish method to only abuse drugs to seek sleep without removing the causative factors.</p>
<h3>Common Sense Q&amp;A About Diseases</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(Eighty-six) Liver Abscess</p>
<p>What is a liver abscess?</p>
<p>Liver abscess is a disease in which the liver becomes purulent, so it is also called Suppurative Hepatitis.</p>
<p>What causes liver abscesses?</p>
<p>Most of them are secondary to purulent diseases in other parts of the body, such as intestinal ulcers, amoebic dysentery, appendicitis, septic pericarditis, pulmonary gangrene, putrid bronchitis, purulent cholecystitis, gallstones, ascariasis, etc. Some are also caused by trauma.</p>
<p>When a liver abscess is very small in the affected area, what symptoms does the patient have?</p>
<p>If the abscess is very small, even if it is multiple, it does not cause any symptoms.</p>
<p>When the liver abscess becomes larger, what does the patient feel?</p>
<p>The patient complains of a dull or severe pain in the liver area, radiating to the right shoulder.</p>
<p>What symptoms does he have?</p>
<p>The symptoms he feels are an enlarged liver, an elevated diaphragm, reduced respiratory movement at the lung boundary, difficulty breathing, vomiting, and hiccups. If the liver enlarges downwards, the rib arch bulges, sometimes presenting with fluctuations, with hypersensitivity or severe pain. Touching it causes coughing.</p>
<p>Does the patient have a fever?</p>
<p>In most cases, there is a chill followed by a fever. But some do not have a fever.</p>
<p>Does the patient with a liver abscess also have an enlarged spleen?</p>
<p>The spleen is usually not enlarged.</p>
<p>Does jaundice occur?</p>
<p>Most of them do not occur either; but sometimes jaundice can occur because the bile duct is compressed.</p>
<p>Are there any abnormalities in the patient's blood?</p>
<p>When there is a liver abscess, the number of white blood cells in the blood increases.</p>
<p>What is the course of this disease?</p>
<p>It varies depending on the original disease. If the original disease is septic, it is mostly acute and takes an unfortunate turn. If the original disease is gallstones, then it takes a chronic course. It also often ruptures into the intestinal tract, trachea, or abdominal wall.</p>
<p>How is a liver abscess diagnosed?</p>
<p>If it is suspected, a test puncture must be performed to see if pus is drawn out. Because it is often difficult to distinguish from infectious cholangitis, gallbladder empyema, and abscesses near the liver.</p>
<p>What is the prognosis of this disease?</p>
<p>Most are bad and often fatal.</p>
<p>What is the treatment?</p>
<p>In addition to the fact that emetine injection must be performed for amoebic dysentery, other cases generally require surgical operation, incision and drainage, but the results cannot be expected to be very hopeful.</p>
<h3>Common Sense of Ear, Nose, Throat and Eye Diseases</h3>
<p>— Tang Renzhen</p>
<p>(Ninety-one) Pupillary Reaction</p>
<p>The pupillary reaction is originally a special function possessed by the iris. It is caused by the interaction of the pupillary sphincter muscle and the pupillary dilator muscle. Its reaction is a reflex. Therefore, the pupillary reaction cannot be regulated by our will. The pupillary reaction is of great significance in the diagnosis of internal medicine diseases. It often provides valuable assistance to doctors. The pupillary reaction can be divided into two types: pupillary constriction reaction and pupillary dilation reaction. Among them, the pupillary constriction reaction can be further divided into light reaction, convergence reaction, palpebral fissure closure reaction, and trigeminal nerve reflex. They are specially described as follows.</p>
<p>Light Reaction When we shine light on the pupil in a dark room, it can immediately cause pupillary constriction. This is the so-called light reaction. This pupillary constriction movement is caused by the connection of the optic nerve and the oculomotor nerve nucleus. There are two other types of light reactions. One is the reaction caused by light entering the pupil, called the direct reaction. The reaction caused by the other eye is called the indirect reaction. The two reactions often occur simultaneously. The duration of the reaction is half to one second.</p>
<p>Convergence Reaction The subject is asked to look into the distance first. Suddenly, he is asked to look at a point at a considerable distance in front of him again. Then the pupil will constrict immediately. This is the so-called convergence reaction. This pupillary constriction movement is a common movement in the area controlled by the oculomotor nerve.</p>
<p>Palpebral Fissure Closure Reaction When the palpebral fissure is strongly closed. Constriction of the pupil often occurs. This is caused by the common movement of the orbicularis oculi muscle of the eyelid.</p>
<p>Trigeminal Nerve Reflex When the trigeminal nerve area of the conjunctiva, cornea, and iris is stimulated. Pupillary constriction often occurs. Therefore, pupillary constriction can often be observed in cases of conjunctivitis, keratitis, corneal foreign bodies, and iritis.</p>
<p>In addition, the pupil often constricts during sleep or anesthesia. This is called sleep constriction.</p>
<p>Pupillary Dilation Reaction When mental excitement occurs or another part of the body receives a sensation (such as surprise or pain). Pupillary dilation can often occur through reflex action.</p>
<h3>Tooth Knowledge Q&amp;A (34)</h3>
<p>— Lin Jianxian</p>
<p>Chapter 7 Treatment of Dental Diseases</p>
<p>(Question 171) Can the people in our country who traditionally "catch tooth worms" really treat tooth decay and toothache?</p>
<p>Answer: As mentioned in Question 63, the cause of tooth decay is not a visible "tooth worm." Because our people have traditionally lacked knowledge of bacteriology, they saw that the decay of fruits, wood, bamboo, etc., is sometimes caused by worms, and therefore assumed that teeth were the same. Unscrupulous people take advantage of this absurd psychology and create many fraudulent methods, claiming to be able to catch tooth worms and treat tooth decay and toothache. Even today, those who make a living from this are still all over the country. This is truly a strange phenomenon in the civilized world! If they can really catch living tooth worms, these worms are definitely not originally in the patient's mouth; they brought them themselves. They are completely deceiving ignorant people.</p>
<p>(Question 172) Some people say that after treatment by "catching tooth worms," the pain of tooth decay is immediately reduced. What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>Answer: Those who "catch tooth worms" often use a copper needle to pierce the gums, releasing a lot of blood, claiming it is "poisonous blood." In this way, the congestion of the affected tooth is reduced, and the pain will naturally be slightly alleviated. However, this is a temporary phenomenon, and the disease is not cured. Soon, the pain will return as before. Moreover, piercing the gums with a non-disinfected copper needle is very dangerous.</p>
<p>Section 3 Treatment of Periodontitis</p>
<p>(Question 173) How should non-infectious periodontitis be treated?</p>
<p>Answer: If it is caused by local irritants, the irritants should be removed first. If it is caused by arthritis, syphilis, or internal medicine, systemic treatment must be used. Methods to alleviate pain that patients can do themselves include: applying iodine or aconite tincture to the outside of the gums near the affected tooth; taking painkillers internally; soaking feet in hot water for half an hour each time.</p>
<p>(Question 174) How should acute infectious periodontitis (i.e., alveolar abscess) be treated?</p>
<p>Answer: In the early stage, the treatment should involve opening the pulp chamber, connecting the root canal, rinsing with disinfectant, and sealing with disinfectant. Apply aconite tincture and iodine to the outside of the gums. At the same time, use laxatives, sudorifics, and hot foot soaks. The purpose of all these methods is to reduce inflammation and relieve pain. However, if pus accumulates and cannot be eliminated, methods should be used to promote its early maturation and then incision and drainage should be performed, and all symptoms will disappear. During the process, if the pain is severe or insomnia occurs, painkillers and sleeping pills should be taken. Laxatives should be used to keep bowel movements regular. And the mouth should be kept as clean as possible, and mouthwash should be used frequently.</p>

<p>Regarding the working principles, in addition to routine epidemic prevention injections and health exhibitions, etc., which will continue to be carried out based on the previous sessions, the following matters are specifically defined as the focus of this health campaign!</p>
<p>(1) Children's Health: Children are the future masters of the nation, and their physical and mental health should be given top priority because it concerns the rise and fall of the country. Moreover, this year is Children's Year, and special attention should be paid to the well-being of children. Therefore, this health campaign first emphasizes the importance of children, and all activities should provide practical guidance on children's clothing, food, housing, and transportation, to achieve the expected benefits.</p>
<p>(2) Maternal and Infant Health: The health of women and infants is related to the rise and fall of the race, and it is more than just a personal matter for each family. This health campaign plans to give special emphasis to this point, and in terms of propaganda and exhibitions, it will focus on conveying various essential knowledge related to women and infants and the childbearing process to citizens, so as to improve family health and racial excellence.</p>
<p>(3) Summer Health: This adapts to the summer season, addressing essential issues such as the elimination of mosquitoes, flies, and bedbugs, and the preservation of fresh food. The association has also compiled a booklet on summer health knowledge, using concise and clear language and practical and effective methods to help the general lower and middle-class citizens solve the various difficult problems of summer hygiene.</p>
<p>(4) Health Training: This association recognizes that public places such as teahouses, restaurants, hotels, barber shops, bathhouses, and entertainment venues have a significant impact on the health of citizens. Although there are various rules and regulations in place, due to a lack of knowledge or understanding of the purpose of the laws, the effectiveness is limited. Therefore, during this health campaign, starting from the 16th and lasting for one week, city-wide health knowledge training will be held for public venues. The Social Affairs and Public Security Bureaus will separately inform the owners of each industry or send representatives to report to the South Shanghai, North Shanghai, Gaoqiao, Jiangwan, and Wusong five health offices for training. Each office will teach simple disinfection methods, communicable diseases, public health, and regulations for each industry, as well as methods for implementing the New Life Movement in each industry.</p>
<p>(5) Cleanliness Campaign: The purpose of the cleanliness campaign is to awaken the general public's attention to cleanliness through the spirit of labor service. The Youth Service Corps of the Municipal New Life Movement Association, the Public Security Bureau, etc., have already carried it out repeatedly, and it has been quite effective. Cleanliness is the preliminary and basic condition for health. Therefore, this time, we are asking the New Life Youth Service Corps, police officers from the Public Security Bureau, members of the Security Corps, security teams, and street sweepers to work together, dividing the city into fourteen areas, led by the mayor, the director of the Health Bureau, and the New Life Movement Association, etc., to complete the work sequentially from the 15th to the 20th, a total of six days. In addition, public places will be inspected on the 27th and 28th, also jointly carried out by the above-mentioned agencies.</p>
<p>The Preparatory Committee will focus on the above-mentioned tasks. Since the launch of preparations, a total of three plenary meetings and one meeting for each committee have been held. All the facilities for the general assembly are roughly planned. The chairman and the secretary-general and deputy secretary-general are responsible for carrying out the work. The activities of this session of the assembly are expected to be outlined as follows:</p>
<p>Propaganda Aspect: Colored printed tin slogans and bamboo and cloth banners will be hung throughout the city. Major newspapers will take turns publishing special editions every day, promoting health theories and distributing leaflets on maternal and infant health and summer health knowledge. Famous figures and experts have been invited to broadcast health knowledge daily on the Municipal Government, Gospel, Chinese and Western radio stations.</p>
<p>Exhibition Aspect: The venue will be arranged at the Public Education Center. Exhibits will be displayed by the Nanjing Health Department, the Central Factory Inspection Department, the Municipal Health Bureau, and the Public Concession Health Department, including a total of more than 5,000 charts, models, and specimens. This exhibition will last from the 15th until the closing of the conference on the 30th.</p>
<p>Performance Aspect: With children's health and maternal and infant health as the center, central activities will be scheduled at the venue every day, and relevant agencies and groups will be invited to participate in performances, and recreational activities or movies will be used to add to the fun.</p>
<p>Promotion Aspect: The promotion work occupies an important position in this health campaign, and the organization is more complicated. The contents include cleanliness campaigns, labor services, health knowledge training for general public places, inspection of public places, and a campaign to discourage spitting, and promotion of factory hygiene.</p>
<p>In short: This health campaign takes into account the needs of the times. Its work should be multi-faceted rather than local; it should have a central activity, but not be biased. Based on this policy, it should be able to avoid mistakes. As the opening approaches, we still invite all sectors of society to teach us. I am most fortunate.</p>
<h3>The Meaning and Several Important Methods of Factory Hygiene</h3>
<p>— Li Xuanguo</p>
<p>The Shanghai 15th Health Campaign has designated today as Factory Hygiene Publicity Day, and I have been asked to give a speech on publicity. You are all leaders in the industrial and labor sectors of this city, and I believe you will pay significant attention to this issue. Let's first explain the meaning of the term "factory hygiene." We all know that the term "factory hygiene" is already just a habitually used term and cannot encompass the entire scope of work. Taking the layout plan of this exhibition as an example, we want to present the contributions of the city's health administration to our life process in order. Therefore, our overall title is "Health and Life." The first part is "Infant Hygiene," building a good foundation for health from pregnancy and birth. As age increases, when the time comes for schooling, "School Hygiene" begins, which is the second part. After completing studies, it is time for a career; in a narrow sense, not everyone goes to work in a factory after graduation. The term "factory hygiene" does not seem to represent all hygiene work during the career period. However, in a broad sense, while one works in a factory, it cannot be said that those not in a factory are not working; work is always the same. Some people want to divide brain work and physical work into two types, which is a mistake. We all know now that physical labor, especially with the application of modern machinery, cannot do without brain work. Brain work sometimes requires considerable physical strength to cope. Also, there is a very accurate proof that there is not much difference between brain work and physical work: regardless of brain work or physical work, when exceeding the capacity range, there is a feeling of fatigue, which is a physiological problem that we do not need to discuss in depth for now. Therefore, it seems more appropriate to replace "factory hygiene" with "occupational hygiene." As mentioned above, we will temporarily follow the customary application and discuss the historical evolution of factory hygiene.</p>
<p>Historical Progress of Factory Hygiene: Our country is based on agriculture. The development of factories has only been a recent phenomenon in the past ten years or so. If we examine the situation in advanced European and American countries that are dominant in industry, there has only been a systematic history of more than a century. In 1767 AD, about 170 years ago, due to the invention of the spinning machine, there was already a large-scale textile industry. At that time, it was still the era of slavery. Workers worked 16 hours a day, were whipped and chained, and were secretly buried upon death. Society regarded factories as places of all evil. A British statistic shows that in 1833 AD, in Manchester, a major industrial town, the average lifespan of workers was only 22 years. In better societies in the town, the average lifespan was 44 years, a difference of more than double. Furthermore, the national mortality rate in Britain at that time was 22 per thousand, while in industrial areas, it was 36 per thousand. At that time, some people regarded factories as slaughterhouses, which cannot be said to be an exaggeration. Relief plans therefore gradually developed. In 1802 AD, Britain passed a factory law in Parliament. The main points of the law are briefly listed as follows: workers should not work more than 12 hours a day; workers should be issued two sets of clothes per year; workers must have the opportunity to study; apprentices must be registered; factory buildings must be whitewashed twice a year; and regular inspections must be conducted by judges or priests. Later, there was gradual progress. Importantly, in 1833 AD, the British government appointed factory inspectors. In 1844, the age of child labor and the employment of female workers were restricted. In 1847, female workers and child laborers could not work more than 10 hours a day. In 1854, the Factory Safety Law was promulgated. Later, there were restrictions on dangerous occupations and the employment of female and child laborers, and then gradually became more complete. The above is the situation in Britain. Other European countries have also made equal efforts. For example, the Berlin Museum of Industrial Hygiene in Germany (established in 1904) and the Vienna Museum of Industrial Hygiene (established in 1909) show in detail the relationship between industry and health, diseases and dangers, their causes, and prevention methods, which is worth commemorating. The completion of social insurance in 1913 was also an important milestone in factory hygiene. The starting point of industrial hygiene in the United States was the protection of child labor. In 1888, there were factory inspection commissioners. The government established many associations to study the hygiene and safety issues of industry, and the results were very excellent. What is noteworthy in the past twenty years is that various factories have voluntarily participated in or sought to improve various industrial hygiene issues. The attitude of refusing factory inspections in the past has completely changed. It is generally recognized that factory hygiene benefits both labor and capital. The above facts tell us that the history of factory hygiene can be divided into three periods: The first period is the dark age, where capitalists only seek to increase production to make huge profits; workers are completely in a state of oppression. The second period is the relief period, where many philanthropists, based on compassion, try to relieve generally devastated members of society. They strive to enact laws, and the implementation of laws mostly sympathizes with the workers and takes a more restrictive attitude towards capitalists. Recently, it has entered the third period, which can be said to be the economization period of factory hygiene. Everyone unanimously agrees that attention to factory hygiene not only directly benefits labor but also indirectly benefits capital economically. Lips and teeth support each other and are mutually beneficial. We consider this type of progress to be very satisfactory, because no matter what business, economic benefits are always happily accepted. Therefore, we can be very optimistic about the future of factory hygiene. (To be continued in tomorrow's Xinwen Bao)</p>

<h3>Recalling the Scientific Examinations of the Imperial Era</h3>
<p>— Jing</p>
<p>I have never been interested in sports. I never care about news about the sports world, such as someone breaking a record or someone breaking another record. So, I don't know anything about sports, let alone have the qualifications to criticize or comment.</p>
<p>However, the recent selection of athletes has made it impossible for me not to say a few words. The selection of athletes for the World Games has been criticized thoroughly in the newspapers since the selection committee announced the results. Some say "the election is unfair," others say "the election is fraudulent," some say "the selection is questionable," and others say "it is self-deception." It is truly chaotic and confusing, and I am deeply puzzled.</p>
<p>The selection of athletes should have certain standards. How high they jump, how far they run, how much time they spend, those who pass are naturally selected, and those who fail are naturally eliminated. Even if many fail, then those who jump the highest, run the farthest, and spend the least time among those who fail are selected. This is an ironclad law. With thousands of people pointing fingers and all eyes watching, no matter how bold and powerful the selection committee is, they should not dare to reverse right and wrong and select arbitrarily.</p>
<p>At first, I was a little suspicious, suspecting that the unsuccessful candidates were jealous or that they were being nitpicky due to regional relations, which is also a possible situation. Later, after examining the facts, I found that I was completely wrong. It was entirely the selection committee abusing their power and acting emotionally that led to the unanimous attack from the sports world. The selection committee also knew that they were in the wrong and had no excuse, and that the selection was erroneous. However, they still refused to correct their mistakes. The public criticism from the media clearly shows that there was no personal interest involved. However, the selection of athletes for the World Games is extremely important. Internally, it encourages the martial spirit of the people of the whole country; externally, it wipes away the shame of being the "sick man of East Asia." Now, the selection committee disregards public opinion and insists on going its own way, which is extremely disappointing.</p>
<p>First, the reason why our country must organize a selection committee to select athletes to participate in the World Games is to obtain a fair and accurate selection of talents. Recently, European countries have been working exceptionally hard on sports, so their level is very high. If our athletes want to participate in the World Games, even if we select top-notch talents, it is still difficult to compete with strong enemies. Now, they abandon the superior and choose the inferior. I don't know what the selection committee is thinking.</p>
<p>Second, there are dozens of countries participating in this World Games. The winning of championships is closely related to national prestige. Therefore, recently, when the African-American boxer Joe Louis was defeated by the German Schmeling, the German Propaganda Minister Goebbels immediately sent a telegram to congratulate him, saying, "Your victory is Germany's victory. It is an honor for you to win glory for the leader Hitler." Conversely, your failure is Germany's failure. Now, our country's selection of athletes abandons the superior and takes the mediocre. Is the selection committee's intention to win glory for the country? Or is it willing for the country to fail?</p>
<p>Third, this time our country is participating in the World Games in Germany, and I heard that the total expenses will be as high as two or three hundred thousand yuan. In this time of poverty and financial exhaustion, raising this money is not easy. Now, the selection committee is acting entirely on emotion and does not choose fairly. The results of this competition are self-evident. Therefore, using hundreds of thousands of yuan to cater to the feelings of a few people is not only a waste of money, but also makes the selection a superfluous act. It would be better to choose a few people from the relatives and friends of the selection committee. Why bother with the formality of selection?</p>
<p>Therefore, I am reminded of the imperial examinations of the Qing Dynasty. Everyone knows the evils of the imperial examinations, such as cheating, impersonation, and bribery. They are so appalling that they are condemned. The imperial examinations were therefore abolished. But if the chief examiner was impeached by the censor and found guilty, he would be dismissed from office at best and beheaded at worst. The grand ceremony of selecting talents was not a trivial matter. The difference between the current selection of athletes for the World Games is only a few points. In the past, officials found guilty of corruption would be punished, but now members of the selection committee can be corrupt without being held responsible. In the past, corruption was a secret act, but now corruption can be blatant. When the country has reached this point, those with power wield it without any scruples. Therefore, the imperial examination system can be abolished, but it should not be abolished.</p>
<h3>Loquat</h3>
<p>— Ji Nan</p>
<p>In front of my study is a courtyard surrounded by walls on three sides, less than a zhang wide. Looking out from the window of the study, the sky is only a narrow square, truly worthy of being called a "well-bottom view." However, a loquat tree miraculously grows in this well.</p>
<p>Loquat, the loquat that comes with the depressing plum rains. It does not have the sour taste of plums, and it is the most popular fruit in early summer.</p>
<p>How could this lovely fruit tree grow in this narrow courtyard? It is not only mismatched, but also</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>Simply too "humiliating," so it must be said to be an "anomaly."</p>
<p>So, what is the story behind this "anomaly"? The story is like this.</p>
<p>I don't know what year it was, and I don't know who it was, but someone casually threw a loquat pit that had just been spat out of their mouth into this courtyard. Later, this tree grew. At first, when it was just a small tree that had just grown, no one could say that its predecessor was a loquat pit, and no one could recognize what kind of tree it was. Some said it was a peach tree, others said it was a plum tree, a pear tree..., it was not until it bore its first fruit that it explained itself.</p>
<p>"The unintentionally planted willow will flourish," it turned out that this was a genuine loquat tree!</p>
<p>Due to the limitations of the three surrounding walls, the tree lost the freedom to grow. Its trunk is very tall, and its branches and leaves only open up above the height of the wall, forming a long-handled canopy, unlike what is seen in ordinary orchards.</p>
<p>Therefore, when the fruits are ripe, although the clusters of golden yellow orbs in the reflection of the green leaves begin to entice me, they are "out of reach." I can only watch the birds peck at them and "see but not touch."</p>
<p>Therefore, these lovely golden yellow loquats, in my eyes, are just beautiful flowers in full bloom. I can only feast my eyes on them but not my stomach. When they are ripe and fall off automatically, are they not like withered and fallen petals? However, when I see it shining brightly in the sunlight, I cannot help but "salivate" and "sigh under the tree."</p>
<p>"Salivating" is a sign of not being thirsty. I did not expect that loquats, like plums, have the unexpected effect of quenching thirst.</p>
<h3>Ah Gen (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhuo Er</p>
<p>If one were to admit that she was a "five dollar foreign girl," then when she drew the pale green curtains at night, someone should commend her "business" as being good. Every few days there was such an occasion, at which time she was like a skillful magician, conjuring up a person with whom she only had a "five dollar foreign" relationship. She giggled, allowing him to tease and fondle her... and then she would draw the curtains. What a discordant picture this was! Painted on the canvas of "five dollar foreign" ugliness.</p>
<p>Recently, Ah Gen has rarely been seen walking in the alley during the day, so the men felt a bit of loneliness and boredom, while the women were happy. They cursed this charming vixen, wishing she would hurry up and die, so that they could be relieved of the responsibility of guarding their beloved men. But, contrary to their expectations, Ah Gen would still gracefully pass through the alley, and what made them even more jealous was that she dressed even more beautifully. Busy-bodies finally found out that she was now having a passionate affair with the boss of a certain store.</p>
<p>Many days later, on a clear morning, the alley was filled with people, mischievous children, idle men and women, clamoring as if something major had happened. A chubby middle-aged woman, gesticulating, cursed: "Shameless, seducing other people's men... rotten cunt." She was pointing at Ah Gen's room, which made it clear that the chubby woman must be the boss's wife! At the same time, many other women were helping her by shouting curses like: "Rotten cunt who steals other people's husbands..." and other embarrassing words. People were laughing and jeering. Even young girls, with red faces, squeezed into the crowd to inquire about what was going on... Everyone was surrounded by a wave of playful mockery.</p>
<p>"Get out here! Rotten cunt, I'll beat you to death..." the chubby boss's wife yelled, her face red and her neck thick. "Get out here!..."</p>
<p>Suddenly, unexpectedly, Ah Gen rushed out with her hair disheveled. Tears streamed down her face, followed by her elderly mother. She stood with imposing air, hands on her hips, pointing a finger at the chubby woman:</p>
<p>"Who are you cursing? Huh, what rotten this and rotten that! I'm not seducing your man, to tell you the truth, I... I want his money... We're poor... I have an old mother, an old father at home... and a little brother! ...They all need money! ...Who hasn't seen your stinky man? No one wants to seduce him, he comes willingly himself, and I take the money! ...Hmph, that's nothing to be ashamed of, don't you all have men too? ...You're the shameless ones! ...Rotten! Aren't you rotten? Aren't you rotten?..."</p>
<p>Before she could finish speaking, the chubby woman, mumbling something, waved her hand, and then she, and the women who had come with her, rushed forward and dragged Ah Gen to the ground. ... (To be continued next Saturday)</p>
<h3>Yellow Skin</h3>
<p>— Chou Tong</p>
<p>The orange-yellow sun shone slantingly on Black Bone Two's thatched hut. From the woods, occasional breezes blew, very cool, without a hint of summer heat.</p>
<p>Black Bone Two took his big-headed bamboo pipe, sat down on a green stone slab in front of the door, sighed painfully, then opened his water pipe box, pinched out a thumb-sized ball of tobacco, pressed it onto the pipe, lit it, and sucked hard. Light smoke was exhaled from his withered mouth as he breathed, like several small green dragons swimming, but it immediately disintegrated and disappeared. ...</p>
<p>"Doo! Doo yo!"</p>
<p>Suddenly, a burst of rapid yelling broke the surrounding silence. A long-distance bus rushed past. Along with the smoke behind the bus came a gust of "Kreosote" stink.</p>
<p>"Damn his mother, stinky fart bug!"</p>
<p>Black Bone Two cursed angrily. The four heavy rubber wheels of the bus passing by him seemed to be grinding his heart. He wished he could knock it over with his pipe.</p>
<p>Two years ago, Black Bone Two was still well-off. He had a two-section single-entrance tile-roofed house and a yellow-skin orchard.</p>
<p>One day, he was returning from the street carrying an empty cargo basket. His son, his eyes pregnant with a terrifying light of melancholy, approached him and said:</p>

<p>Jinghong: Why shouldn't it be added? Is there something to be avoided?</p>
<p>Liya: That's natural, what I hate is Suzhou, don't you know?</p>
<p>Jinghong: I know you hate Suzhou, but I don't know why you started calling me Suzhou Sister?</p>
<p>Liya: The reason I call you Suzhou Sister is because of what that Suzhou Sister said on the ship: it's completely flattery! Good at flattering and complimenting people; that's a unique trait of Suzhou people! Suzhou Sister, don't you think so?</p>
<p>Liya: You don't need to ask me, since you already understand, why do I need to explain it to you again? I won't talk to you anymore, goodbye.</p>
<p>Jinghong: This is the third "goodbye," do you want another "goodbye"? (Said and laughed for a while)</p>
<p>Liya: I absolutely can't let you make fun of me, I'm leaving, no need to see me off! No need! (The sound of leather shoes moving away).</p>

<p>Opening "Baoyu Sacrifices to Qingwen"</p>
<p>Fine days, beautiful scenery, a good festival approaches. Hibiscus fills the garden, doubling the sorrow. Throughout history, beautiful women have had thin lives. It is pitiful that a sickness ended her soul. The little maid's sorrowful root of feeling is said. Baoyu is, teardrops drench his clothes. Tonight is, respectfully prepared with offerings of apples, dumplings, and grain. A single incense of the heart is sent to the hibiscus god. Sister, your spirit has not faded in the White Emperor Palace. Do not refuse emotions descended before the flowers. Sister is, since descending into the world at the age of sixteen. We have been together for only five years. In life, her beauty was ice pure and clean. Flowers ashamed, moon shy, appearance toppling cities. It is pitiful ah. Innate intelligence meets with envy. The deadly poison has been around since ancient times. Secretly cherish the bitterness of a premature death. Where to find her traces after death. Father heard, Hui's coffin was burned and hurt painfully. In this life, it is difficult to fulfill the feelings of sharing the same tomb. I once remember, her eyebrows were drawn in green smoke. Until today, the jade ring is cold, asking to warm it up. The remaining music from the incense burner is still there. Remaining tear stains wet the clothes. Now is, alone, with whom to tell dreams. Also feel, an empty room with no shadow, even zero. This moment is, dew-covered stairs, the moon is dim, and her spirit is vague. Only hear, the sound of crickets chirping in the earth. Unexpectedly, the begonias are withered and not what they used to be. Until now, the parrot in front of the curtain still calls her name. In the yellow soil mound, your life is thin. Under the gauze window, you are extremely affectionate. Death and separation are predetermined. How many people see the blessings and wisdom of a beautiful woman? I will, enter the empty door, cultivate Zen, and abandon the mundane world.</p>
<p>Xu Wenbi's Opening</p>
<p>Trade (720) Midnight 1:00 AM to 1:45 AM</p>
<p>Opening "Peony"</p>
<p>The peony reigns supreme in the flower kingdom. At that time, green leaves and red flowers showed off their beauty. Wealth uniquely marks its extraordinary qualities. It sits as leader, commanding the group of flowers. The flower god has a month of flower mornings and evenings. Drawing out the charming face of different species of goodness. I once remember, the Qing court harshly demanded literary prisons. That poem, with a different title, also claimed kingship. Immediately stirred up a boundless disaster. How many scholars died for this. Pitifully, even after death, they must expose the corpse. Not allowing the white bones to be buried in the wasteland. Now the country's affairs are in turmoil. Who remembers the literary heroes of the past? Wu Meicun, showed off his poetic madness. Angrily rushing out for a beauty. Later on, King San Gui of Dian bought it for a thousand gold. Not allowing the poem to be deleted and hidden. So, the Qing court was tyrannical and mad. A single piece of paper implemented a literary prison. Implicating many good gentlemen. Pity his bones were not buried. In the desolate wilderness. Peony poem. Truly sad. That barbarian. Showed off his fierce strength. Actually, the writers were completely disrespected. The heroes of Yun and Gui rebelled against the Qing court. Also, because, they could not bear the cruel and poisonous hearts. Pitifully, the ten-character poem draft. Suddenly made a chapter of everlasting blood. Purple peony. Especially fragrant. Green leaves support the beauty. March flowers are called first. He wants the flower kingdom to be king alone. Idle, quiet, chaste, and fragrant.</p>
