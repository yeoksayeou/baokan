<p>時評</p>
<h3>世界和平運動大會</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>據昨日比京消息。世界和平運動大會。已於三日晚八時正式開幕。參與的有三十七國的代表四千餘人。其中最特著的人物。有英國國際聯盟協會會長薛西爾勛爵。法國衆議院議長赫禮歐及航空部長谷特。蘇聯總工會領袖薛惠尼克。西班牙人民陣綫政府代表亞爾伐萊士等等。此外更有許多各國文化界的有名人物和重要社會團體的代表。這樣一個盛大的會議。確是値得注意的。</p>
<p>我們對於這個努力於世界和平的會議。不但應加以重視。而且應加以贊助。因為就整個世界說現在各國競增軍備。戰爭的濃雲到處密布。但是戰神的逞兇。正是全世界和平民衆的不幸。所以為了保障世界的和平與安寧。我們就應當贊助這會議。其次就我國自身說。我們受到侵略戰爭的荼毒。至少已有五年慘痛的經騐了。我們和各國民衆合力促進世界的和平。也卽是保障自己民族的安全。</p>
<p>我們展開近來的報紙加以檢視。在世界和平運動大會消息之外。有西班牙內戰中叛軍的慘酷屠殺。有德國延長兵役年齡後各國的反響。有英美的主張保留超過年齡的驅逐艦與日本的要求保留逾額的潛水艇。更有日蘇邊境的糾紛與我國綏束的危急。在泛世界的戰雲瀰漫。中比京的和平運動大會正如黑暗中人類文明一綫的曙光。我們不能不承認。現在世界上戰爭的黑雲是超過了和平的光輝。但我們也不能不認淸。祇有靠了世界和平民衆的努力。和平光輝才能擴大起來。</p>
<p>不過。在歡迎和贊助比京世界和平運動大會之餘。有兩點我們不得不提出來一說的第一以往許多國際間的和平會議如國際軍縮會議之類。表面上是要消弭戰爭實際上却因為各國的無誠意結果反而加緊了軍備的競賽增進了戰爭的危機現在的世界和平大會和那些會議根本上是不同的。以往的許多會議是以各國政策上的鬥爭為背景。這次的會議却是以全世界民衆對於和平的要求為背景的。把這樣廣大的和平力量集合起來。對於世界和平的前途。必可有切實的帮助。第二。現在我們雖然要求維持國際間的和平。但在目前侵略者逞在的時代。我們所主張的和平。乃是相對的而非絕對的這是說。我們雖然要求國際間以相互的保證。維持和平。但在侵略者不顧一切。挑開戰爭的時候。被侵略者除了聯合共他主張和平的國家。共同加以抵制之外。祇有以正當的自衛。博取最後的和平。</p>
<p>最後。我們願以萬分的熱誠。希望這次世界和平大會的成功。</p>

<h3>巴勒斯坦變亂的解剖（下）</h3>
<p>— 不忍</p>
<p>為其他協約國政府及美國所承認的巴爾福宣言」，不啻是猶太民族主義的地位　要求所根據的一張憑照。但這憑照是可以有不同的解釋的。文字上，那宣言不過是原則的簡單陳述，並不是具體的行動計劃。猶太民族主義者常然用最有利於他們自己的意義解釋這宜言。到了奧托曼帝國崩潰，勝利的協約國似乎在近東可以無所不能的時候，猶太民挨主義者的希望也『着膨脹起米。於是，　且爾塞和平會議中，他們要水在巴勒斯坦建設獨立的猶太統治，受列强的武力援助與國聯的保證。</p>
<p>可是，正在猶太民族主義者覺得　程遠大的時候，另一個同堅決的運動也同時興起、　就是阿拉伯國家主義。　大戰期中，英國曾獲得阿拉伯人的友誼；他們曾叛離土耳其，且以有價値的援助給了英國。但這援助是英國用一種密的貿來的，這密的雖然意旨模糊，却不失為建造包括巴勒斯坦的阿拉伯聯邦的保證。到了大戰完畢，阿拉伯人當然緊决要求着英國實踐諾言。</p>
<p>不僅如此。除和猶太人與阿拉伯人暗中交易以外，英法政府更相互秘密協定，瓜分近東的政治的與經濟的勢力。許多「委任統治地」就是此項恊定的產物——法國獲得叙利亞，英國獲得伊拉克，巴勒斯坦及其屬地外的但尼亞。</p>
<p>這些安排，顯然使阿拉伯人與猶太人俱深感不安。但這兩民族的互相敵視，並不因此稍减。猶太民族主義急進派主張「巴勒期坦是猶太人的巴勒斯坦，正和英國是英國人的英國相同」幷且告訴住在巴勒斯坦的阿拉伯人，假如他們不歡迎這局面，他們不妨避到鄰近的廣大的阿拉伯土地上去。激狂的阿拉伯人發誓出死力反抗猶太民族主義，不久就起暴動。這樣，巴勒斯坦的流血慘劇，就從此開始，而且前途還黑暗得很。</p>
<p>當兩方各趨極端的時候，委任統治地的英國當局曾竭力使風潮平靜。但這是無濟於事的工作。受巨大經費的資助，為偉大的然忱所感動，猶太民族主義者已獲得可驚的進步。一九二〇年委任統治政府成立時，巴勒斯坦的猶太人的八四，〇〇〇名－僅占全人口百分之十。十年後，人數增至一七〇，〇〇〇名，所有地增加一倍。從一九三〇年起，進步特別顯著。目前，巴勒斯坦的猶太居民已達三七五，〇〇〇名－占全人口百分之四十，開墾的土地達四〇〇，〇〇〇畝，全部投資逾三〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元。所以，這是毫不足怪的：巴勒斯坦的阿拉伯人深感前途的危險，開始邀同近東的同種，竭力抵抗正在蔓延開來的猶太民族主義勢力。</p>
<p>阿拉伯人聯合一起的力量，究竟也是無限的。目前，他們的領袖是愛沙特。這位勇武的國王已把廣大的阿拉伯半島的大部分置於他的權力之下，而且顯然正在努力建設一個聯邦，這聯邦將包括西亞細亞阿拉伯語人民所在的全部土地，連埃及也包括在內。</p>
<p>這宏大的計劃顯然使夾國和法國都受威脅。法國人已因叙利亞時起叛變感到棘手，也許他們會放棄在他們的主要殖民地範圍以外的叙利亞委任統治地。但對於央國，近東却屬非常重要；而且，為保護蘇彝士運河與完成逮印度的新闢航空綫起見，巴勒斯坦允屬必爭之地。</p>
<p>但英國的政策屢次碰到不易應付的窘境。愛沙特所領導的阿拉伯主義是一個秘密的威脅。假如英國公然反對，它就要引起各處阿拉伯人的仇恨，印度的回敎徒更不必說。猶太人雖矢忠於擁護英國權力，但他們的能力是否充分頗成問題。同時，法西斯意大利的示威運動使糾紛的程度更進一步。意大利人顯然是要在近東的混水中捉魚的。</p>
<p>巴勒斯坦的最困難的局面，是兩方急進派所採取的手段。極端猶太民族主義者，大多數是靑年；他們明白與阿拉伯人妥恊約無望，所以公然依賴武力。他們的目的是建設一個被明白承認的猶太國。但阿拉伯人也提出大膽的答辯。最近數年來，阿拉伯靑年中已增添不少决不妥恊約分子。這些熱血靑年是預備犧牲一切的。他們斥責舊領袖太懦弱，太腐敗。他們大膽宣告：他們的决心是不但要打倒猶太民族主義，且更要撤消英國在巴勒斯坦的委任統治。實在，「不列顚帝國主義」和「猶太民族主義」是同樣為他們所仇視的。</p>
<p>巴勒斯坦目前的糾紛情形，大概就是這樣。前途固然黑暗，但希望不是沒有。英國殖民地的官塲是能幹的，英國的政策是聰明的，而且阿拉伯人與猶太人俱不乏具才智與先見的領袖。假如他們利用良好的政策，又加以相互容忍與諒解，則目前巴勒斯坦的困難問題，或者可以得到妥善的解决吧。（節譯Lothrop　Stoddard原作）</p>

<p>查香港前受一九二二年華盛頓條約所限制、不能武裝强化自衛的力量、所有駐軍及設備、只敷維持本地治安的安寗、本年英軍事當局、鑑於遠東危機日迫、由財部議决撥出二千萬元、在新界方面建築營房、其地點已指定在九龍曠野興建、可容納新兵六團之衆、（每團約六千人）與粉嶺空軍地點相連、原在深水埗長沙環濱海之臨時兵營、將撤去改為住宅區、在九龍彌敦道之印度兵營、俟新營房築成、亦將遷開、以免軍民雜居、查香港現有英軍四團、若增加六團、人數則在六萬以上、防守之實力、已綽有餘裕、下月開蘭夏第二團、調往星洲、改調蘇格蘭及巴爾斯坦之兵、來港瓜代、重砲隊。高射砲。探照燈。化學戰隊等、今春己到有一批、現仍陸續乘艦開到、稱來之新兵、所用者為現代最新式之器械、在鐸也船塢登岸、搬進兵工廠儲藏、鐸也海軍工廠、每日有二三千人做工、英當局為防止奸細、入內窺探軍事起見、所有華洋工人、一槪照相登記、打指印、發給證書、若無此蹬混進去東張西望者、則以奸細治罪、足見軍事上準備嚴密之一般矣、</p>
<p>至於防空防毒工作之進行、為香港目前最緊張之工作、因全港居民九十四萬、華人佔百份九十以上、故凡華人之醫生看護、及識英文之學生靑年職工、多報名參加救護隊、另將倫敦防毒會之小冊子、印成漢文、分送給居民、並規劃凡新建築之民居屋宇、均須另闢一防毒室、防空委員會、每月開會一次、現已草定一種計劃、一旦發生戰事受襲攻時、除警察及公務員留居本港外、其餘人民則遷過九龍、移居各大山洞中、山上有安全設備、可分散藏、避免擠擁、例如某山、可容十七萬人之衆、山中飲料糧食、皆有充分準備、源源供給難民、不致缺乏、政府又劃全港為四十區、各區儲蓄糧食、建有蓋之水池、决不致被毒氣傳染、防毒會又將全港各區、擇適中安全地帶、建避毒所、使交通電氣工人在內工作、不致受毒、至若敵人來襲時、政府於三十分鐘之前、發出警告之信號、信號一響、全港紅十字會救傷車消防隊、立卽準備出動、目前本港樹膠廠、奉命趕製防毒面具、每套約三元餘、甲種為兵士用者、乙種為公務員出入用者、丙種為居民用者、此項面具、加緊製造、由政府收買儲藏、今年十月間、將有極大規模之防空防毒大操演、此外尚有防空十年計劃、政府擬令全港業主、將第二三樓築一防毒室、另撥一百五十萬元、作建設一公衆防毒之所、至若入烟稠密之區、政府限定每樓住客入數、預備開關蘭頭島、作貧民工業區、减輕地稅差餉、分散本港貧民、免臨時周章、混亂秩序、</p>
<p>另據香港英文電信報、自負責方面探悉、最近港地所組織之防空委員會、經多次之討論後、已草定遇天空襲擊時暫時遷移全體居民之計劃、其規模之大、將為新時代戰爭史上所未有、蓋將在九龍四周諸小山中、預闢住區三處、共能容一百萬人、房屋散播、力求相距、不相連屬、每一小團、聚居一所、其糧食與食水、悉由當局祖任供給、事急之事、唯留警察與公用事業之人員在鎭、故遇飛機來襲時、可免許多生靈慘遭荼毒、</p>
<p>天空襲擊之最足畏者、厥為毒瓦斯、防瓦斯委員會對此已籌定防禦計劃、其最要者、為謀公用事業如電燈瓦斯自來水運輸電話等辦事人員之安全、擬在港地全部擇定地點、備適當之建築、以容納此輩、俾身處其中、得安然服務、炸彈與瓦斯、均不足害之、其次、則為平民顧慮、委員會担保、（一）揮公私建築之第一第二層之易於迅速改為避瓦斯所者、一一紀明、俾遇急卽可實行改造、（二）使食水與糧食均免染瓦斯之毒、（三）以一種公認警號、時時訓練民衆、俾遇飛機突然來襲時、警號一發、人民卽知趨避、（四）隨時使救傷隊醫士消防隊作天空襲擊時之救傷練習、俾熟諳其特別職務、（五）製造一種有效的防瓦斯面具、使人民均易購置之、</p>
<p>至於防瓦斯面具、現正與橡皮工廠接洽製造之、務使其價格低廉、雖貧民亦力能人購一枚、此種面具、大約將仿英國所製之式製造之、計分三等、頭等者為絕對保護性面具、且連衣服、專供戰事需用、二等者為暫時保護性面具、供公用事業人員用之、三等者為供平民用之一部分保護性面具、按普通防瓦斯面具、如英國之供給平民者、在保護人之肺部、使免受芥子瓦斯之毒性、不能護及身體、防瓦斯面具與橡皮衣服之供給公用事業人員需用者、能暫時保護身體內外部、至於供戰事用者、則能永久保護身體焉、今香港義勇防務團所備之面具、與常備軍所備者、完全相同、按芥子瓦斯、與同類瓦斯、乃瓦斯戰爭中之最厲害者、蓋此類瓦斯、播散後、其毒能留空氣中數日之久也、石灰氤化物、為封藏芥子瓦斯之主要化學品、故香港現正商購大批石灰氤化物、存儲備用、</p>
<p>香港當道不欲俟敵人以炸彈轟擊後、再事報復、近十二個月來負防務之責者、曾積極進行一切、從事完成兩年前籌定之防務計劃、港地全部、尤其為新界境內、凡各險要地點現正在安置高射砲以防空襲、據非官塲估計、港地防禦毒瓦斯一舉、所需之經費、共約一百五十萬元、而陸海空軍防務所需之費、並不在內云、</p>
<h3>蘆鹽出口辦法商定　本月旬運出七萬噸　每噸售價約二元六角</h3>
<p>天津通信、蘆鹽輸日之事、連日經長蘆鹽運使署所轄之蘆鹽出口事宜專署、蘆豐公司、及三菱岩井等中日關係機關洽商、契約已經簽訂、每噸納稅一元、鹽價及雜項共三元、長蘆鹽運使署、本月三日、已電呈財部轉飭津海關監視運輸、三菱公司、頃正招僱駁船、着手打裝、約本月中旬、卽可運出、第二批共七萬噸、本年運輸、止於此數、來年將運出百二十萬噸、漢沽鹽灘距塘沽汽船碼頭的百二十里、駁船輸送不便、三菱公司特請津日總領事館轉商我冀察建設委員會、興築漢沽迄塘沽一段公路、俾載重汽車可得通行、建設委員會巳准許、日前特派工程師前拌勘視路綫、最近期內、當可興築、蘆盥出口契約、經蘆鹽出口專署、蘆豐公司、幷三菱岩井兩行共同簽訂之條件如下、（一）本年輸出口蘆鹽七萬噸整、（二）每噸納國課二元、（三）每噸價二元六角、（其斤秤折合零星費用、每噸約合四角洋數零計之、）（四）國課鹽價及雜費一律繳訖後、方准起運、（五）本契約經雙方簽字呈准中國主管官廳核准有效、除此契約外、專署與蘆豐公司一另訂有合同、限制共包銷裝船、及在沿海各地私賣等事、一切都根據財部命令辦理、以防流弊、關於此事、據出口專署科長劉仁甫談、蘆鹽輸日、具體辦法、均經商妥、僅餘瑣細問題、日內卽可完全確定、日方購妥之七萬噸、旬日內當可運出、裝運辦法、先由灘塲裝入駁船、再由塘沾裝入大汽船、刻由蘆豐公司、僱妥打包·秤行·搬運三種工人、準備在灘塲聽用、盥價前本定為每噸四元、因日商一再要求低减、結果每噸祗兩元六角、可謂奇廉、徵收鹽稅、按財部所定之公噸折合新市秤核算、每噸約為新秤二十四担、若普通適用之新市噸約合二十担、漢沽鹽灘實行之舊市噸、約合十六担、均不採用云云、新任長蘆運使李翰華、為此事於三日赴平、謁宋哲元陳商、將來起運時、防出口後轉往沿海販銷、特由津海關監視裝船、唯此項公文、財部及滬總稅務司猶未頒到、但預計本月十五日左右、决可依的運裝、不再遲延矣、此次運出蘆鹽、為漢沽所產、歷年積存於塲內者、灶戶雖嫌其價過低、第以有現欵可易、尚不十分反對、唯鄧沽鹽灘、則嫌價格過小、拒絕躉售、今歲因尚無需該地產鹽、專署對此亦未措意、來年出口時該灘所產、已定在銷出數內、故必得一番疏解、始可成交也、（四日）</p>
<h3>冀省本年度新預算　力求緊縮務達收支適合　裁减敎費引起敎界反對</h3>

<p>申報兒童專刋立志  嚴懋德　　小朋友們！甚麽四做志呢？志就是我們一生做事的目標，有了這目標，做事纔不致有徬徨歧路的危險。　　當你們做一件事，開始很高興，後來却冷談，這是什麽緣故呢？還有開始到後來，總算沒變更，可是沒有功效，對己對人，都得不着利益。這是什麽緣故呢？這是做事沒有一定的目標，所以白白的費了多少的心思和手續。　　原來的志可分為兩種：（一）先定一個大志，然後依着這個志向做去，中山先生就是這樣的。（二）先定一個小志，實行以後，然後逐漸把它擴大起來，美國煤油大王洛克斐勒就是這樣的。　　總之，小朋友！對於前途的事業，須要立定一定的目標，然後赴以全心全力，不怕險阻，不避艱苦，如此則成功之期當不遠。兒童掌故隨談  易生　　張憑規祖　　張憑有敏捷的才幹。起初他做着小官，為了公事去謁見一位名宦。其時賓客滿堂，他因官卑祗得一挨在末座上，也沒有人理睬他。有一個官吏啟禀公事，那位名宦感到事情棘手，一時不得適當的解决，未免躊躇。他諮詢在座諸人，也沒有一個應承得下，但有面面相窺罷了。張憑站起來發為論斷，頭頭是道，全能明爽無憾。那位名宦不禁肅然起敬，當日特地向上官前推薦他。他在平地裏得到逾格的陞拔。他從小便聰慧異人。他的祖父張鎭，做過蒼梧太守，曾對他的父親歎道：「我倒不如你！」他的父親一時間莫名其妙，祗候解釋。張鎭道：「你有好兒子。」這還不是當面瞧不起他的兒子麽？那時張憑的年紀祗有幾歲，他在旁聽得這話，却垂手正容說道：「祖父！把兒子來取笑做父親的，似乎不行罷？」他的祖父只是對他微笑點頭，沒得一句話。　　普通的孩子，要是有人讚美他，他的內心裏一定非常樂意，並表同情於那讚他的人了。我想張憑也未必不喜歡人家稱讚他；可是他覺得這個榮耀是由他父親遭受羞辱所換得的，他就不希罕這個榮耀，也顧不得他祖父的尊長地位，髯可直言糾諫了！可見做尊長的人在小輩面前發言，也不能太隨便的，——一個大意却給小輩捉住了把柄而無法轉圜，豈非老大沒趣？駱駝  仲美　　這日的下午，小敏從小朋友勇兒的家裏回家的時候，在街中的小商店買了一隻咖啡色的駱駝玩具，他是預備妹妹在生日那天送給伊，作為一件小小的禮物，他回家以後，就把它放在自己床邊一隻小檯子上，仍舊回到書房中，於是問起哥哥駱駝產在什麼地方，哥哥回答他道：「敏弟，駱駝大都產在我國北部的地方，像蒙古新疆有沙漠的地方，而別的國家像阿拉伯也產另外一種駱駝。」　　「那麽它們吃些什麽食料，它們有什麽用處呢？」　　「它們很喜歡吃稻草蔬菓一類的東西食量很大的，它們的功用，能够搬運極重大的物件，它們的肉和乳都可以吃，身上的毛剪下來可以織成駱駝絨，在冬天穿了很溫軟，但價錢是很貴的。」　　「哥哥：它們在沙漠中怎樣適合生活呢？」　　「它們適合沙漠中的生活：（一）因為它們的蹄雖然生得很大，然而不怎樣發達，但是在足趾以下的肉極豐厚而發達的，在沙漠中走的時候，所以不易沒有沙土中而能够走很遠的路程，像牛羊的蹄，雖然硬而堅固，但不便在沙漠中行走。（二）它們的鼻孔生得很奇怪，能够自由開關，在沙土灰塵吹來的時候就把鼻孔關住，所以適合沙漠生活。（三）它們的胃，分為三隻。就是瘤胃，蜂巢胃及皺胃，同牛一般要反芻的，並且在瘤胃四周，附有二十個小的水囊是貯水用的，若將要在沙漠中作長途旅行時，就把水吸在二十個水囊中應用，能够幾天不渴這種組織在沙漠中很需要的。（三）它們有很厚大的眼瞼，微微張開，風沙就不易吹到眼晴中。（五）在它們的背上，有兩個或一個像小山峯一樣的東西，就是它們貯藏豐富脂肪的地方呌做肉峯。在它們缺乏食料的時候，把肉峯中的脂肪慢慢的溶解，於是能够滋養它們很大的身體了，上述的五點，就是駱駝適合在沙漠中生活的原故。」一個小英雄  谷田　　小朋友，我來講個小英雄給你們聽聽吧。這個小英雄並不是書本裏的古董貨，而是現實的活生生的人。他姓張，名字呌做小良，原是吉林省密山地方人。他家裏很窮，靠種田過活，所以他沒有像你們一樣受過學校的敎育。但他做事很勇敢，很認眞，時常帮着他的父親在田地裏幹些活計。　　九一八以後，敵人因為怕我們東北的百姓掩護義勇軍，所以就逼着小村子上的人，都搬到大村子上去住，而把小村子都用大砲轟掉了。張小良的家是住在小村子上的，當敵人逼着呌他們搬走時，他父親說：　　「這裏是我們的祖產，我們住着已經好幾十代了，我不願搬！」　　敵人就把他父親捉了去，當做義勇軍的探子而被處死。　　從此，張小良便只有一個人了，他沒有母親，又沒有弟妹，現在父親又給殺死了！你們想：他應該怎末辦呢？　　自然，我們這個小英雄，—張小良，他是不願做亡國奴，不願被敵人壓迫，又不願白白地被殺死，他就祇有一條路：常義勇軍去！　　如今，這個小英雄，已經是東北義勇軍中的一員，他今年才只十四歲，他已做了一個游擊隊的指揮了，他時常帶着他的那些英勇的夥伴們，出沒在密山虎林一帶，攻擊敵人，敵人都很怕他，替他起了個綽號，呌做「小閻王」。兩個有趣的算術游戲  春旭　　一，不變的和數　　請找一個小朋友，（須在讀書的）向他問下面四個問題：　　（一）你在民國幾年生？　　（二）你在民國幾年進學校？　　（三）你今年幾歲了？　　（四）你入學巳幾年了？　　把他回答你的四個答數相加，便生一個和數。（牢記這個和數）隨後你再把上面四個問題，問另外一個小朋友：把他回答的答數，照以前一樣相加，便生一個新的和數，這新的和數一定和上次第一個小朋友答數的和一樣，並且任憑可以問多少人，而結果總是不變的，不信可一試，便知眞假了。　　二，固定的答案1089　　集合三四個小朋友，每人拿一枝筆，一張紙，呌他們在紙上寫任何一個三位數字。（第一位字不可和第三位字相同）例如假使有一個小朋友寫523一個數目。　　請他把這數目字反轉，便成為：325　　隨後把這兩個數目裏的大數减去小數，523——325＝198　　再拿所得餘數反轉成為：891　　最後便把上面兩數相加：198＋891＝1089這1089便是公共的答數，不論那一位小朋友，用那一個三位數字，照上面方法計算，結果便總是1089；不信也可一試　　兄弟姊妹們在郊外踢球，阿狸也飛奔而來，張開了嘴，小弟弟嚇了一跳，怕牠吞下肚子呢。  （徐文瑛）不知自量的老蛙  闌刪　　在小河的岸邊，有兩隻靑蛙伏着，一大一小，是父子身份。近傍是一片草地，一隻黃牛在吃草。　　小蛙驚異地對老蛙說：「啊喲！爸爸！剛纔我看見一隻大得可怕的動物呢！」　　老蛙：「在那兒？」　　小蛙：「在那面草地上。」　　老蛙：「它是什麽模樣的？」　　小蛙：「是紅色的，有四隻脚，有雙大眼睛，有兩隻彎彎的棍子長在頭上。啊喲！它大的了不得！」　　老蛙：「哼！哼！有多少大呢？像我這樣大嗎？」　　小蛙：「它大—大得多哩！」　　老蛙：「沒有的事！但我能够弄大我的身體的。（一面說着，一面把自己的肚皮脹大起來。）有這樣大嗎？」　　小蛙：「是的，它還比你大多了！」　　老蛙：「咄！我不相信！」（又把肚皮脹大一點）「有這樣大嗎「？　　小蛙：「還比你大！大到了不得！」　　老蛙想再脹大一點，可是它的身體吃不消了，像氣槍樣的樸的响了一聲，它的身體爆炸開了，皮肉和骨，片片紛飛。　　小蛙：「啊喲！爸爸呀！啊喲！爸爸呀！」　　自已的能力所做不到的事，切不要勉强而為之，老蛙想與牛競勝，而將自己的性命白白送了，這就是犧性於不知自量的一例。藏風  一志　　一天，悶熱的晚上，忽然起了凉風。　　甲生：「好風呀！悶熱的身體經牠一吹，眞凉爽極了。」　　乙生：「眞的，這種風假使能够藏起來的話，在悶熱時拿出來吹吹，倒很開心的。可惜是辦不到的」！　　甲生：「藏風嗎？經你一說，我倒想起來了：我家隔壁有一個成衣匠，他會藏風的；他把風藏在一隻木箱裏，隨時隨地可以拿出來吹，我常常去吹的」！　　乙生：「驚異的：眞的嗎？不要騙人」！　　甲生：「當然眞的！誰騙你。　　乙生，跳起來拉了甲生的手：「陪我去看！陪我去看」！　　兩人走到了成衣舖裏，甲生就去抽動着風箱：「你看！他藏的風，不是可以隨時隨地拿出來用嗎」？　　乙生不禁啞然失笑：「哈哈！原來……」組字畫　　下面的一隻軍用戰鬥飛機是由「願小朋友們努力用功一心求學光榮祖國」十七個字組成的，「願」是表示雲塊，其餘十六個字組成飛機，這是在天空中飛行時從側面所見到的姿態，請看那姿態怎樣的雄壯，怎樣的强悍！它有三架發動機，兩架一前一後的旋轉機關槍和下面突出的炸彈拋擲器，戰鬥能力的强大很可以見到了　　小朋友們想來都已經知道，吾們的祖國現在是已經達到非常危急的地步了；恥辱和苦痛層層壓迫着吾們中國人，吾們能忍受着嗎？吾們是永遠不能够忍受着的，吾們必須要起來救護吾們的祖國，光榮吾們的祖國，這樣才能免去恥辱和苦痛的壓迫。　　願未來國家主人翁的小朋友們快快從今日起努力用功一心求學，做一個最切實的準備，等到將來長大了，每一個以前的小朋友都像一架飛騰的戰鬥飛機一樣的强悍，威武而有力，起來救護祖國，光榮祖國。打鐵歌  夏中漢　　鐵撻，鐵撻，　　用我們的汗，　　流我們的血。　　我們雖給世界殘踏，　　不怕，不怕，　　這世界：　　脫不了我們的汗，　　少不了我們的血。　　用力哪！用力哪！童子軍信箱水火燒鷄　　——答青島　嚴獨清　　獨淸弟：　　你有那樣淸福，跑到山明水秀的靑島去避暑，又到嶗山去露營，這果如你所說的是「人生愉快的生活」。　　你描寫第一次在九水的野宴，可眞說得有聲有色。你說討厭你自己的職守，要隨時注意着那燒出油的肥鷄，不時來把牠轉動。這也難怪你，他們在那邊戲水，歌唱，遊戲，而你却派着做這條麻煩的職務。但我們這；到後來你把那香妹撲鼻的一塊肉塞進口裏時，你一定覺得這塲工夫不是白費的吧！　　你說第二次的野賽，想避免這麻繁的工作，而想帶燒好了的食品去，這固然是一個辦法，但那裏有自己燒來自己食的來得有味呢，况且當塲燒出來的總比帶來的香吧。其實，如果你們能稍為用一下腦子，這問題便可以解决的。這方法就是水火燒鷄，你看到這名詞，也許會覺得奇怪，燒鷄怎會出起水　　了　　你　　的地方是九水，難道你忘記了這地方的泉流嗎？你也記得嗎中山先生曾經告訴我們說　以利用　流的水力來發動電力嗎？如果你明白了，這個事情就解决了呀。　　你看我們這裏一幅圖，很明白地指示你怎樣用水流來解决你的問題。緊繫着棍子上的鷄會很自然地跟着水輪不停的慢慢轉動，這樣你不就可以放心走開了嗎？但你切記水輪不要放在急流中，否則棍子很易離位，那時你回來時，也許那隻快要到口的肥鷄已經給火神吞去了。　　其他的問題，讓我們直接給你答覆吧！望你下次野宴時來試試這玩意。請了，祝你好！　　中國童子軍自助社謹覆兒童自由畫  鄒英繪國王與牧童（七）  新　　但是他在淚眼糢糊中瞧見的是什麽呀？原來他見窗格的外面，恰恰有一個而龐和他相對着，正在對他瞧，這時那明月恰好躱到了雲後去，光亮己暗淡了。他難道是不望着窗外而在瞧着一面鏡子麽？因為他所瞧見的分明是自己的面龐。咦！不對不對！那面龐上面的頭髮是黑色而不是金黃色的，他並且覺得自己的手接觸到了幾個溫暖的手指。是呀，這是別人的手也正握住了窗上的鐵梗，又有一陣嗚咽的聲音，送到他的耳邊。月光忽地從雲中冒了出來，小王華樂便很淸楚的瞧見了那牧童華樂的面龐。　　這一個探頭向着窗外，那一個探頭向着窗內，兩個孩子面對面的彼此相望着。　　小王華樂急忙問道：『孩子，你為什麽哭呀？』　　牧童華樂嗚咽着答道：『因為我不能進來的緣故。但是你為什麽哭呀？』　　小華樂嗚咽着答道：『因為我不能出來的緣故。』　　他們倆同聲說道：『道眞好玩得很！』於是兩聲低低的笑，掩住了他們的鳴咽聲，而他們的笑臉上，還帶着潤濕的淚痕。　　小王華樂問道：『你為什麼要到這裏邊來呢？』　　牧童華樂答道：『因為我瞧這裏邊很富麗很光煥，委實是可愛極了。我要知道住在裏面有怎樣的感覺。我身上覺得好冷，心中好生納悶，須得等到天明了方能回去。我想從這窗格中擠將進來，使我身上暖和一下，然後回去看守我的羊。它們正在那邊，你可聽得那鈴聲嗎？但是這為什麼要出來呢？』　　小王華樂忙道：『因為我恨這王宮。咄！道簡直是一座挺大的牢獄，况且我要賞玩那可愛的月光，在它的明光下跳着舞着，一僩人自由自在，我並且要吸受一些冷氣，痛快一下。』　　兩個孩子一面微笑一面嘆息，不的而同的說道：『我願意做你！』　　牧童華樂問道：『你那黃金的王冠在那裏？你不是常戴的嗎？』　　『咦！並不。我睡覺時是不戴的，我把它掛上一個木釘上，委實說，我是痛恨這東西的』！那小王這樣的說。　　牧童華樂急道：『我很想把這王冠試戴一下。』　　小王華樂搖頭道：『你决不會歡喜它的，我一戴上去就覺得頭痛。這東西是重得什麼似的。我倒很想有你那麼一根彎頭的杖弄着玩哩。』　　牧童華樂嘆息道：『這東西也是重重的。』</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊　業餘周刊書報春秋評「戀愛破滅論」  魯夫　　（盧劍波編，泰東書局出版）　　在生活問題之外，戀愛總算是靑年人最重要的問題了。一提到「戀愛」，「愛情」，人們總覺得有點興奮，欣羨，縱使你是過着困苦的生活，怎樣地遭遇着不適意的事情，但你如果染着戀愛，一旦沈醉於愛情之海中，你都會振作起來，似乎領略到了人生的樂趣，而使你積極，進取。在另一方面，你如果一旦失戀，那也許你會心灰意冷，「垂頭喪氣」，甚至感到厭世，消極，自殺。有些人一旦沈迷於愛河中，他又會「不識不知」，淫逸，浪漫，而至於墮落。總之，戀愛對於人們，除了飲食問題而外，可說是再重要不過的問題了。　　有些人把戀愛神聖起來，認為戀愛是有愛神在那裏主持，這完全是精神的娛樂，是感情的結晶，高尚純潔，而不涉於淫穢的肉體行為，性的行為；又以為戀愛是超乎一切社會關係，不受一切物質的條件之制約，不受一切生活問題的影響，牠是超肉體的，超時代的，超階層的一種純精神的美化了的行為。這便是戀愛至上主義論。又有些人主張戀愛就是簡單的性的問題，性的行為，男女肉體關係，除了這種肉體的性的關係而外，是無所謂戀愛的，同樣，這也與一切社會環境，肉體以外一切物質的條件無關，只要是兩性，只要一接觸，都會發生性的行為的，决沒有所謂「愛情」，「情感」等存乎其間。這便是戀愛消滅論。　　我們現在所要批評的一戀愛破滅論」就是屬於後一派。　　這本書是盧劍波，向培良，高長虹，謙弟幾個人的關於戀愛問題的論文集，他們有着共同的意見，卽是主張戀愛破滅論。　　試看他們怎樣說吧？他們主張：「兩性之性的結合，只有性交。而性交則完全是肉感，並沒有所謂戀愛。」「性交是生理一方面的事，决無有心理之可言（而所謂心理，只不過是神經系的刺激與反應之表示而已）。」「性慾之存立，是沒有什麼愛字的意義存乎其間；當能進一步的承認兩性基於性慾的性交，此外更沒有所謂戀愛這一回事的。」　　自然，那些戀愛至上論者以為愛情可以超乎一切物質，超乎肉體，而說戀愛與性的行為無關，這純是玄學論者，主觀主義者，因為離開了物質的肉體，而去講求那超越的精神的理想的純粹愛，那就永久得不到愛情的樂趣，那也可以說是還未達到戀愛成功的境地。但是反過來說，如果否認了一切愛情，而把男女關係完全歸的成一種性的關係的戀愛破滅論者，其錯誤則恰與戀愛至上論者相反。在我們看來，戀愛問題，雖然主要的動機是從人類的生殖本能和種族本能中發生出來的，但人類並不是一般動物，他巳有那比一般動物進化更高更複雜的生活，所以他的性的結合就不單靠肉慾來滿足，不但靈感和性情之投合是很重要的，而且一般的道德，學問，思想等等也很足以使愛情因而濃厚或淡泊。所以戀愛破滅論者的說法是機械的物質論。　　還有，戀愛破滅論者說：「如果我們根本破除人為萬物之靈的人為字宙中心的思想，認定自己對於事事物物的了解並不比我們的祖先聰明好多，那麽，我們便可以了解我們人類現代的性生活還是與我們的祖先在跑一樣的圓圈。」根據以上的議論，旣然我們和我們的祖先原始人類差不多，我們的祖先又和猿猴動物等差不多了，那麽，我們的性的生活應該現在還是動物的，無怪乎本書的作者在論雜交一文中主張原始人類和動物的雜交，他們純是性自由主義論者！但是他們只知道人是自然的產物，而不知道人也是社會的產物，只懂得人類之動物性，而不洞得人類之人類性，他們只是把動物和人類純一起來看了。我們知道人類的生活方式完全是要受其社會的經濟的物質條件之限制的，婚姻的形式，性的關係，亦復如是。在氏族社會時代有雜交式的性關係，在封建社會時代有一夫多妻制的性關係，在資本卞義社會則是一夫一妻的性關係，因為各時代的經濟條件不同，所以各時代的婚姻形式也不同。如果想把歷史毀滅，把現在和將來的人類的性關係拉轉去和原始時代的一樣，那全是一種幻想。自然，到了將來的社會，其性關係一定不同於現在，但是也决不如戀愛破滅論者所說那樣，一定要「返乎自然」，回復到原始人類的絕對自由的雜交的性關係。須知歷史的發展是進化的，决不是完全的重演和循環，而且就是原始的性關係也眞地是絕對自由，而不受共社會經濟條件之影響嗎？　　正如戀愛論者所說，現在的戀愛是金錢的戀愛，愛情可以用金錢來換取，而性的問題因之也頗受壓迫，而不得其自然發展。但是現在愛情之成了商品，之受壓抑，這正是由於社會制度之不良，束縛了愛情之發展，决不是由於愛情本身之過錯，更不足以證明戀愛之破滅，或根本沒有戀愛那一回事。我們看那些志同道合的伴侶，不怕生活是如何地痛苦，環境是如何地惡劣，但有些還是斬荊披棘的共同奮鬥着，甚至有些是雙雙自殺，同歸於盡，以身殉情。固然把戀愛放在第一位，不惜拋棄一切，犧牲一切來供奉牠，是不對的；但是戀愛，愛情，總是有的，而且是應該寶貴，尊重的，决不如戀愛破滅論者的說法。因為戀愛純是男女兩性在長期的相互選擇，互相愛慕，而於不知不覺之間雙方都發生了愛情，並不是純全的一種性的關係。　　還有，戀愛破滅論者倒因為果地說：「性的解放是人的解放之第一步首要工作，否則人依然是奴隸」，所以性關係的改造是社會改造之第一步首要工作。自然，性的解放也是社會改造中的一重要問題，但是，若果我們就如戀愛破滅論者所論，把現在買賣式的婚姻制度打破，而採取了絕對自由的雜交婚姻制度，那社會就會根本改造了嗎？整個的社會制度未加改造，經濟關係未加改造，性解放了便甚麽都解决了嗎？殊不知婦女問題之要得到徹底的解决，必要以社會問題之解决為前提。　　戀愛破滅論者「抹煞結婚制與自由戀愛，而主張自由性交」，卽雜交，這便是他們這理論的最後結論。戀愛破滅論一書完全是陳述的這種理論。推原其故，這也是現社會之一種反映。因為一般小市民在經濟上是動搖不定，因之在性的關係上也得不到滿足，然而有時也能自由地不規則地覓取一些純肉體的慰藉，他們又看不見社會發展的必然規律，看不見未來社會的肖像，他們只是仇恨現社會的不平和醜惡，所以他們便消極，而有時又興奮，不免要想在現實的不滿人意的社會中尋求一個滿足的自由的世界，又幻化了過去的古代，以為那是絕對自由的，所以主張返乎自然，而贊成「自由性交」，「雜交」。總之，戀愛破滅論的理論基礎是現社會的小市民的幻滅游離，動搖不定的思想之所致，戀愛破減論這部書是一本有毒質的書，不怕牠對現代的大市民的戀愛給與了若何的批評。名人傳記印度聖雄甘地  剛　　著名的不抵抗主義者托爾斯泰在一九零八年十二月十四日給一位印度人寫了一封長信，從各方面說明了他那不抵抗惡的思想。這封信不久卽傳遍世界，同時並落在了一位印度靑年手裏，他在托爾斯泰的精神感動之下，於一九</p>

<h3>Chiang Summons Generals to Discuss Responses to the Guangxi Situation; Chiang Personally Writes Reply to Persuade Li and Bai; Rumor Says Wang Chonghui Will Go to Guangxi; Cheng Qian Says Foundation for Peaceful Resolution in Guangxi is Solidified</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Ju Zheng, Cheng Qian, and Zhu Peide, along with Guangxi representative Liu Weizhang, arrived in the province by plane at 4:00 PM on the 4th and immediately went to Huangpu to report to Chiang. Liu presented a personal letter from Li and Bai. They returned to the province at 7:00 PM. Ju, Cheng, and Zhu, along with Chen Cheng and Qian Dajun, attended Yu's banquet to discuss the Guangxi situation in detail. Li and Bai's attitude remains as stubborn as before. On the morning of the 5th, Chiang summoned the generals and Cheng, Ju, Zhu, etc., to Huangpu to discuss solutions. Considering that Li and Bai still do not understand the Central government's difficulties, Chiang personally wrote a long letter of persuasion and entrusted it to Liu Weizhang to be flown to Yong on the 6th for delivery. Peaceful resolution of the Guangxi situation still requires further negotiation. Chiang also telegraphed Feng, reporting on the Guangxi affair, and requested him to persuade Li and Bai again to realize the situation.

<h3>World Peace Congress</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>According to news from Brussels yesterday, the World Peace Congress officially opened at 8:00 PM on the 3rd. More than 4,000 representatives from 37 countries are participating. Among the most prominent figures are Lord Cecil, President of the British League of Nations Association; Herriot, Speaker of the French Chamber of Deputies, and Côté, Minister of Aviation; Shvernik, leader of the Soviet Trade Unions; Álvarez, representative of the Spanish Popular Front government, and many famous figures from the cultural circles of various countries and representatives of important social groups. Such a grand meeting is indeed worthy of attention.</p>
<p>We should not only pay attention to this conference that is working for world peace, but also support it. Because, from the perspective of the entire world, countries are now competing to increase their military strength, and the dark clouds of war are densely spread everywhere. However, the rampant violence of the god of war is the misfortune of the peace-loving people all over the world. Therefore, in order to safeguard world peace and tranquility, we should support this conference. Secondly, from the perspective of our own country, we have suffered from the poison of wars of aggression for at least five years of painful experience. Our joint efforts with the people of various countries to promote world peace also safeguard the security of our own nation.</p>
<p>We open the recent newspapers and examine them. In addition to the news of the World Peace Congress, there are the cruel massacres by the rebel army in the Spanish Civil War, the reactions of various countries after Germany extended the age of military service, the claims of Britain and the United States to retain over-age destroyers, and Japan's demands to retain over-quota submarines, as well as the disputes on the Sino-Soviet border and the crisis in Suiyuan in our country. Amidst the pervasive global war clouds, the Peace Congress in Brussels is like a ray of light in the darkness of human civilization. We cannot but admit that the black clouds of war now exceed the light of peace in the world. But we must also recognize that only through the efforts of the peace-loving people of the world can the light of peace be expanded.</p>
<p>However, while welcoming and supporting the World Peace Congress in Brussels, there are two points that we have to bring up for discussion. First, in the past, many international peace conferences, such as the International Disarmament Conference, ostensibly wanted to eliminate war, but in fact, due to the lack of sincerity of various countries, they resulted in the intensification of the arms race and increased the risk of war. The current World Peace Congress is fundamentally different from those conferences. The previous conferences had the struggle of national policies as their background. This conference has the demands of the people all over the world for peace as its background. Bringing together such a broad peace force will definitely provide practical help for the future of world peace. Second, although we now demand the maintenance of international peace, in the current era when aggressors are rampant, the peace we advocate is relative rather than absolute. This means that although we demand that countries maintain peace through mutual guarantees, when aggressors disregard everything and provoke war, the victims of aggression, in addition to uniting with other peace-loving countries to jointly resist, can only achieve lasting peace through legitimate self-defense.</p>
<p>Finally, we wish with utmost sincerity the success of this World Peace Congress.</p>

Chinese public and officials with broad vision have clearly recognized that this move is necessary.

<h3>Proposal to Amend the League of Nations Covenant; Two More Countries Propose Amendments; Switzerland and Estonia</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Regarding the amendment of the League of Nations Covenant, the Swiss government recently submitted a proposal to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, stating: "The current Covenant should be amended so that countries that have already withdrawn from the League or have not yet joined can participate. Although the Covenant may lose some legal force in this way, it will definitely increase its effectiveness in spirit. It should be noted that when some major powers are outside the League of Nations, the League of Nations cannot fulfill its important obligations in the world economy." As for the various sanction measures, they can easily endanger Switzerland's security, and Switzerland should not rashly participate. For over a century, Switzerland has strictly maintained neutrality in various international disputes, which has been recognized by countries around the world. (5th Day Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Regarding the amendment of the League of Nations Covenant, the Estonian government recently submitted a proposal to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Avenol, stating that there is no need to amend the Covenant.

To strengthen the League of Nations, two preconditions must be met: (1) disarmament, and (2) the League of Nations should be universal in nature. The Estonian government concluded by stating that it is impossible to universally implement military sanctions, and the only solution is to establish regional collective security mechanisms.

<h3>Secretary-General of the League of Nations to Meet with Italian Foreign Minister to Discuss Cooperation Issues</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Informed sources recently stated that the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Avenol, will soon travel to Rome to meet with the Italian Foreign Minister, Count Ciano, to discuss the issue of continued cooperation between Italy and the League of Nations. Since the outbreak of the Italo-Abyssinian War, the League of Nations passed sanctions against Italy in November of last year, which Italy was very dissatisfied with. Although the sanctions have since been lifted, the annexation of Abyssinia by Italy has not been recognized by all parties. Italy may request the League of Nations to take the lead in this matter before agreeing to resume cooperation, and Avenol's mission may therefore be difficult. (5th Day Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Germany Massively Building Tanks; Currently Has Three Tank Divisions; Plans to Add Eight More Divisions in the Future</h3>

<h3>British Female Aviator Safely Crosses the Atlantic; New York Prepares a Grand Welcome</h3>
<p>(New York) The honor of being the first woman to fly across the Atlantic from east to west has been won by Mrs. Beryl Markham. Mrs. Markham previously worked in the British diplomatic service and is the sister-in-law of Sir Charles Markham, a famous wealthy mine owner. Mrs. Markham took off from Abingdon Airfield in London at 6:50 PM yesterday (British Standard Time) and flew over Renews, Newfoundland, at 2:35 PM this afternoon. She is now flying west at a low altitude and is still 1,200 miles away from New York. It is reported that the weather along the American coast is foggy, with strong northwesterly winds. Before Mrs. Markham flew over Newfoundland, it was reported that she had flown over Ireland in strong winds. News from Newfoundland received in London this morning stated that the weather there was unfavorable, so many were concerned about Mrs. Markham's safety. At noon today, the British Admiralty stated that it had not heard of Mrs. Markham's whereabouts. After the news of Mrs. Markham's safe crossing of the Atlantic spread, everyone was relieved and hoped that she would fly to New York without any obstacles. It is now reported that New York is preparing a warm welcome for this female aviator. If the weather is favorable and the American aviators Lee and Maurel can depart from England tomorrow, another aircraft will cross the Atlantic this week. Lee and Maurel are currently staying in London and are scheduled to take off from Abingdon Airfield at dawn tomorrow. If these two aviators can also safely fly to New York, two aircraft will have flown across the Atlantic in a matter of days, which would be an unprecedented achievement in aviation history. The aircraft piloted by Lee and Maurel can carry eight passengers. All the decorations inside the aircraft have been removed to accommodate a large amount of gasoline, and 40,000 ping pong balls have been carefully packed in the wings to ensure that the aircraft can float if it lands in the sea.

<h3>An Analysis of the Palestinian Turmoil (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Bu Ren</p>
<p>"The Balfour Declaration, recognized by the governments of other Allied nations and the United States," is nothing less than a letter of credit on which the demands of Jewish nationalism are based. But this letter of credit can be interpreted in different ways. Literally, the declaration is merely a simple statement of principle, not a concrete plan of action. Jewish nationalists naturally interpret this statement in the way that is most beneficial to them. When the Ottoman Empire collapsed and the victorious Allied nations seemed to be able to do anything in the Near East, the hopes of Jewish nationalists also swelled. Thus, at the Peace Conference in Versailles, they demanded the construction of an independent Jewish regime in Palestine, aided by the armed forces of the great powers and guaranteed by the League of Nations.</p>
<p>However, just when Jewish nationalists felt that their prospects were boundless, another equally determined movement was also on the rise—Arab nationalism. During the Great War, Britain had gained the friendship of the Arabs, who had rebelled against Turkey and provided Britain with valuable assistance. But this assistance was bought by Britain with a secret trade. Although the meaning of this trade was vague, it was nonetheless a guarantee to build an Arab federation including Palestine. After the war, the Arabs naturally firmly demanded that Britain fulfill its promises.</p>
<p>Not only that, but in addition to secretly dealing with the Jews and Arabs, the British and French governments secretly agreed with each other to divide the political and economic forces in the Near East. Many "mandate territories" were the product of this agreement—France obtained Syria, Britain obtained Iraq, Palestine, and Transjordan.</p>
<p>These arrangements clearly made both the Arabs and the Jews feel uneasy. But this did not reduce the mutual hostility between the two peoples. Radical Jewish nationalists advocated that "Palestine is the Palestine of the Jews, just as England is the England of the English" and told the Arabs living in Palestine that if they did not welcome this situation, they might as well move to the vast Arab lands nearby. Fanatical Arabs vowed to resist Jewish nationalism with all their might, and soon riots broke out. Thus, the bloody tragedy in Palestine began from then on, and the future is still very bleak.</p>
<p>While both sides were tending to extremes, the British authorities in the mandate territory tried their best to calm the storm. But this was a futile effort. Funded by huge expenses and moved by great enthusiasm, Jewish nationalists have made astonishing progress. When the mandate government was established in 1920, there were 84,000 Jews in Palestine, accounting for only 10% of the total population. Ten years later, the number increased to 170,000, and the area of land owned doubled. Since 1930, progress has been particularly remarkable. Currently, there are 375,000 Jewish residents in Palestine, accounting for 40% of the total population, with 400,000 acres of cultivated land and a total investment of over $300,000,000. So it is not surprising that the Arabs in Palestine feel a deep sense of danger about the future and begin to invite their kin in the Near East to resist the spreading forces of Jewish nationalism.</p>
<p>The united power of the Arabs is also unlimited. Currently, their leader is Ibn Saud. This brave king has placed most of the vast Arabian Peninsula under his control and is clearly working to build a federation that will include all the land in West Asia where Arabic-speaking people live, including Egypt.</p>
<p>This grand plan clearly threatens both Britain and France. The French have already been troubled by the frequent rebellions in Syria, and perhaps they will give up the Syrian mandate territory outside their main colonial area. But for Britain, the Near East is very important, and Palestine is essential for protecting the Suez Canal and completing the new air route to India.</p>
<p>However, British policy has repeatedly encountered difficult predicaments. The Arabism led by Ibn Saud is a secret threat. If Britain openly opposes it, it will arouse the hatred of Arabs everywhere, not to mention the Muslims in India. Although the Jews are loyal to supporting British power, it is questionable whether their abilities are sufficient. At the same time, the demonstrations of Fascist Italy have further intensified the dispute. The Italians are clearly trying to fish in troubled waters in the Near East.</p>
<p>The most difficult situation in Palestine is the means adopted by radicals on both sides. Most of the extreme Jewish nationalists are young people. They understand that there is no hope of compromise with the Arabs, so they openly rely on force. Their goal is to build a Jewish state that is clearly recognized. But the Arabs also offered a bold response. In recent years, many uncompromising elements have been added to the Arab youth. These passionate young people are prepared to sacrifice everything. They condemn the old leaders for being too cowardly and too corrupt. They boldly declare that their determination is not only to overthrow Jewish nationalism but also to abolish the British mandate in Palestine. In fact, "British imperialism" and "Jewish nationalism" are equally hated by them.</p>
<p>This is probably the current state of the dispute in Palestine. Although the future is bleak, there is still hope. The British colonial officials are capable, British policy is intelligent, and there is no shortage of talented and prescient leaders among both the Arabs and the Jews. If they use good policies, coupled with mutual tolerance and understanding, the difficult problem in Palestine may be properly resolved.

<h3>World Peace Movement Conference Organizes Permanent Body to Undertake International Propaganda Work</h3>

The French representative, Mr. Shi Wu, also explained the responsibilities of trade unions in various countries in the anti-war movement, stating that trade unions in various countries must always strive to place all ethnic groups on an equal footing economically, but that to achieve this goal, it is impossible to succeed without amending the current treaties. Finally, Shi Wu mentioned the League of Nations, saying that although the League of Nations has suffered setbacks, countries should still support it to enhance its power. (4th Day Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japan's Electricity Control Issue Becomes Focus of Political Strife; Conflicting Opinions on Whether to Approve or Reject</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Four Ministers Conference to review and examine the Electricity Private Ownership and State Operation Bill held its second meeting on the 5th and has already touched on the core of the issue, exchanging opinions with each other. It is still unpredictable whether the private ownership and state operation bill advocated by the Ministry of Communications can be established. The financial community naturally opposes the Electricity Private Ownership and State Operation Bill, and there are also fierce opposing opinions in the political circles, especially within the Minseito Party, which has quite complex opposing opinions. Therefore, it also has a tendency to become a major political issue. However, Minister of Communications Lai Muqi strongly advocates the private ownership and state operation bill, not yielding an inch, while Minister of Finance Baba, Minister of Commerce and Industry Ogawa, and Minister of Railways Maeda consider a satisfactory resolution of the situation from their respective standpoints. Prime Minister Hirota and those around him believe that if the Four Ministers Conference unexpectedly encounters disputes, the opinions of the cabinet members conflict, and there is no hope of a satisfactory resolution, then, based on the first principle of a unified cabinet, Prime Minister Hirota will make a ruling, at which time he will abandon everything and adopt the Minister of Communications' Electricity Private Ownership and State Operation Bill as the government's original bill and make a final decision.</p>
<p>Regarding the Four Ministers Conference to create a specific plan to strengthen electricity control, it is scheduled to continue questioning the Ministry of Communications' plan at the third meeting on the 12th. From the fourth meeting, it will formally review the electricity state ownership and state operation bill advocated by the Minseito Party and the Seiyukai Party. At the Four Ministers Conference on the 5th, Minister of Finance Baba expressed his opposition, and the opinions of the cabinet members seemed to be the same as those of the Minister of Finance, so this plan did not become a topic of discussion at the Four Ministers Conference. The remaining issues are the private ownership and state operation bill of the Ministry of Communications and the semi-official and semi-private plan advocated by the private sector and a portion of the cabinet members. Judging from the progress of the Four Ministers Conference on the 5th, the cabinet members seem to hope to quickly determine a specific plan to eliminate the anxiety of the financial community, so it may be possible to obtain the approval of the Ministry of Communications' plan around the time of the Great Exercise. Therefore, the progress in the future is more optimistic, but the opposition movement is still fierce, and the opposing opinions among the cabinet members have not been eliminated. Therefore, the Four Ministers Conference still needs to be convened three or four more times, so it is extremely difficult to decide on a specific plan before the Great Exercise. Therefore, whatever the result, it is feared that detours and twists and turns will be unavoidable before a decision is made. (5th Day Domei Telegram)</p>

<h3>Spanish Rebels Advance Victoriously; Cabinet Reorganization Becomes More Left-Leaning; Two Communists Enter the Cabinet for the First Time; Twenty-Four Italian Aircraft Assist the Rebels</h3>
<p>Madrid. Qi Zuol, who assumed the position of Prime Minister amidst the sound of rebel gunfire on July 18th, has tendered the resignation of his entire cabinet today. The Socialist leader, Jiabalailuo, will immediately succeed him in forming a new cabinet, with Taifa serving as Minister of Foreign Affairs. According to sources in the French diplomatic community in Paris, the establishment of the new Spanish government signifies its intention to strongly resist the rebels and fight to the end. Jiabalailuo is a prominent leader of the Spanish Labor Party and a strong opponent of the monarchy. In 1917, he was sentenced to life imprisonment for his radical activities. The new Foreign Minister is a journalist who advocates friendly relations with France. Another notable figure in the new cabinet is Puli Tuo, who serves as both Minister of the Navy and Minister of Aviation, and whose views are more moderate than those of Jiabalailuo.

The new Prime Minister, Jiabalailuo, has today formed a mixed left-wing government, including six Socialists, two Communists, one member of the Republican Union Party, one member of the Catalan Autonomous Party, two members of the Left Republican Party, and one member of the Basque Nationalist Party, all of whom are extremely left-leaning. However, no members of the syndicalist or anarchist parties are participating. The influence of the anarchist party is expanding rapidly in Catalonia and throughout the country. The new cabinet now has the support of the Communist Party and is planning to recruit figures from the syndicalist movement in the near future. (4th, Kuomintang News Agency)</p>

<p>Andai. After occupying the key strategic point of Yilun, the Spanish rebels are now actively preparing to launch a fierce attack on Sangsebasi, a famous summer resort in the northeast. They are currently heavily bombarding the forward positions of the government troops, and then plan to attack with infantry in an attempt to take it in one fell swoop. Several thousand rebels are currently concentrated northeast of the town, awaiting orders to advance. However, it is rumored that Sangsebasi may surrender to avoid street fighting, thus potentially avoiding the disaster that befell Yilun. Yilun is currently still shrouded in dense smoke. The last of the civilian militias to leave the city crossed the border last night, and all resistance has completely ceased. However, the rebels have not yet occupied the entire city, as they are proceeding with extreme caution for fear of an ambush. But in reality, the city is completely under the control of the rebels. According to unverified reports, government troops used high-voltage electric wires to execute a large number of people detained as hostages before withdrawing. The Archbishop of Valadolid, Puri Tela, is also said to be among them. (5th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) The Spanish Chargé d'Affaires in Britain notified the British government this afternoon that twenty-four Italian aircraft had been delivered to Vigo, Spain, for use by the rebels, and requested their attention. Regarding this matter, it is heard that the British government has obtained information from another source confirming that Italian aircraft have been supplied to the rebels. It is also heard that these aircraft were delivered to Vigo on the 28th of last month, and that Italy's ban on arms exports only came into effect on that day. At that time, the Italian ships carrying the aircraft had already entered Spanish territorial waters and were no longer subject to Italian law. (4th, Havas)</p>
<h3>The New Spanish Cabinet: Uniting Left-Wing Comrades to Quickly Quell the Civil Strife</h3>
<p>Madrid. The Spanish cabinet has been reorganized again, with the Socialist leader Jiabalailuo as the new Prime Minister. Today, he issued his first declaration, stating that the current government is the direct representative of loyal comrades, slightly reorganized to bring in those who had not previously participated in the cabinet. The mission of the new cabinet is to unite all comrades, adopt effective plans, and quickly put down the rebellion. The new cabinet also wishes to declare that Spain has no imperialistic ambitions and is committed to maintaining world peace. It aims to continue its friendly relations with all friendly nations and is willing to consistently abide by the League of Nations Covenant. The new cabinet is determined to maintain the integrity of the national territory and deeply respects the civilian militias who have sacrificed themselves for the country, so that the republican system may not fall. Members of the government will certainly work diligently, so as not to fail the ardent blood of those who are loyal to the country and love the people. (4th, Kuomintang News Agency)</p>
<p>Madrid. The Qi Zuol cabinet recently tendered its resignation to President Yachana. The President immediately appointed the left-wing Socialist leader Jiabalailuo to form a new cabinet, which has now been established. The personnel are as follows:</p>
<p>Prime Minister and Minister of the Army: Jiabalailuo</p>
<p>Minister of Foreign Affairs: Taifa</p>
<p>Minister of the Navy and Aviation: Puli Aituo</p>
<p>Minister of the Interior: Gialacha</p>
<p>Minister of Finance: Naigelin</p>
<p>Minister of Commerce: Tiegulasiya</p>
<p>The above are all members of the Socialist Party.</p>
<p>Minister of Education: Hailantai Shi</p>
<p>Minister of Agriculture: Mali Bei</p>
<p>The above are all members of the Communist Party.</p>
<p>Minister of Justice: Chuan Nai Si, Left Republican Party</p>
<p>Minister of Public Works: A Mou Er, Basque Nationalist Party</p>
<p>Minister of Transportation: Teluosi, Unified Republican Party</p>
<p>Li Wosi</p>
<p>Minister of Labor: Yibilai, Catalan Left Party</p>
<p>It should be noted that the new cabinet is still a People's Front cabinet, but its range of participating parties is wider and its color is more left-leaning. The Socialist Party has replaced the Left Republican Party and occupies a dominant position in the new cabinet. The entry of the Communist Party into the coalition cabinet is an unprecedented event. (4th, Havas)</p>
<p>Madrid. The new Prime Minister, Jiabalailuo, is 67 years old and is a leader of the left wing of the Socialist Party, chairman of the Madrid Provincial Party Committee, and chairman of the General Confederation of Labor. He served as Minister of Labor in the Yachana cabinet in 1931. His son is currently being held hostage by the rebels. The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Teerfayu, is also a member of the left wing of the Socialist Party and is well-known in the journalistic community. He previously served as Ambassador to Mexico. The Minister of Finance, Naigelin, is a professor of anatomy at the medical university and belongs to the moderate faction of the Socialist Party. He repeatedly served as Minister of Finance and Minister of Public Works between 1931 and 1932. (5th, Havas)</p>
<p>Base Longna. The news of the establishment of the new cabinet of Jiabalailuo, the left-wing leader of the Socialist Party, has been received with satisfaction by the general public here, who believe that the actions to suppress the rebels will be powerfully promoted and will become more and more vigorous in the future. (4th, Havas)</p>
<p>(Paris) The newspapers here have been commenting on the fall of Yilun, Spain, and the reorganization of the cabinet. The right-wing newspapers, such as the Paris Echo, the Daily, and the White Day Report, regard the loss of Yilun as important, believing that the day of the great victory of the National Army of Spain is not far away. As for the cabinet of the left-wing socialist leader Jiabalailuo, it is denounced as a prelude to Sovietization. The left-wing and central newspapers, such as the Socialist People's Daily and the Little Daily, mostly praised Jiabalailuo and the defenders of Yilun. The main points of the newspapers' arguments are excerpted below. The right-wing Paris Echo reported, "In terms of the situation of the war in Spain, General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the National Army, may capture the city of Madrid in mid-month. The government troops of the country, who are commanded by the Third International, have now been defeated, which should have a good impact." The newspaper then commented on the formation of the Jiabalailuo cabinet, saying that the power of the country has now been taken over by the "Spanish Lenin." The Sovietization of the country has been deepened by this. If General Franco, the leader of the National Army, does not quickly restore order, the bankruptcy of the country will be inevitable. The central Little Daily reported, "The Spanish militia is lacking in both arms and food, and the situation is hopeless, but they still defend it to the death. We should respect them as heroes. The members of the militia sacrificed themselves for their beliefs. Even if they die on the battlefield, the beliefs they defend will still be passed down to immortality. As for the rebels, even if they win the final victory, they cannot win over the hearts of the people, because the regime that is obtained by killing compatriots is unlikely to last." The People's Daily reported, "After the establishment of the new government in Spain, the central government has completely united with the people of Madrid," and so on. (5th, Havas)</p>
<h3>Yilun Completely Falls; Foreign Legion Troops Triumphantly Enter the City; Heartbreaking and Tragic Scenes at the Brickyard</h3>
<p>Andai. The Spanish rebels today broke through the last defensive works of the Yilun defenders with tanks and armored cars equipped with machine guns. The city was completely captured by the rebels, and a contingent of foreign legion troops triumphantly entered the city. Most of the remaining civilian militias in the government army fled into France. Two hundred members of the militia had fought desperately to defend the last defensive works at the bridgehead, but finally gave way and retreated. The rebels' yellow and red flag was raised above the Spanish border outpost at the bridgehead. (5th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Andai. A special report from our reporter: The international bridge connecting Yilun, northern Spain, to the French border is a railway line. It has fallen after an attack by the National Army of the country this morning, ending the fighting around Yilun. The focus of the war has now shifted to the town of Fondarabia. (5th, Havas)</p>
<p>Bihe Mi. After the rebels occupied Yilun today, they immediately sent troops to attack Basachi to the west. If they can conquer this place, they can cut off the sea route to Sangsebasi. Sangsebasi and the provincial governor Ke Tielizhi have now fled to France. Government army security forces massacred fifty prisoners before the fall of Yilun. Little Bihe Mi also fell at the same time. A total of 2,000 people were killed on both sides in this battle. After the government army won, they sent 200 prisoners to Godarubai Fort, where 20 government army daredevils were stationed. They swore that they would coexist with the fort and would kill all the prisoners when the fort fell. Hantai telegraphed today that the leaders of the refugees there convened a military meeting, planning to counterattack tonight. At least 1,800 troops have passed over the iron bridge to Yilun. Although Yilun has fallen, there are currently at least 500 security forces lying in ambush in various nearby areas. (4th, Kuomintang News Agency)</p>
<p>Bordeaux. Before the fall of Yilun this morning, 800 members of the militia belonging to the Spanish government army took refuge in France and were disarmed and accommodated, and were transported by special train to this question, and then sent to the city of Baselona, ​​which is now in the hands of the government army. When the train arrived here, it ran very slowly. Most of the militiamen in the car were wearing military uniforms, and the civilians next to them were wearing the blue uniforms of the People's Front, shouting Long Live France. Then they got out of the car one after another. Although the militia looked tired, their movements were still very agile. They changed to another train after getting off the train and sat down separately. Then, women who were visiting at the station shouted the names of acquaintances to show their condolences. One of the militiamen declared, "Yilun fell this morning. We set off from the town of Beihebia between 6:00 and 7:00 in the morning to come here. We are now going to Baselona. We really have no way to support it, because the number of rebels is relatively large, and the few cannot defeat the many." Another person said that he personally saw the rebels enter the city of Yilun and estimated that the number of rebels was about 3,000, and the artillery fire was fierce, so there was no way to resist. In one of the cars was a woman holding an eleven-month-old baby. She could not bear to leave her husband, so she traveled with him. In another car, a militia representative was holding a meeting. At 7:15 p.m., the train headed towards Beibiniang and Baselona. (4th, Havas)</p>
<h3>Neutrality Committee: Germany Decides to Participate, Portugal Proposes Two Conditions</h3>
<p>(London) Regarding the international adjustment committee proposed by France, it is now heard that the German government has decided to participate and will announce it tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, and will send Prince Bismark, the German Chargé d'Affaires in Britain, as its representative.

As for Italy, it is heard that it will wait until France replies to Germany and Portugal's inquiries regarding the powers of the adjustment committee before sending representatives to the committee. Before this reply is sent, Italy will adopt a wait-and-see attitude. (4th, Havas)</p>
<p>Lisbon. Regarding the various measures to not interfere in the Spanish civil strife, after the British and French governments proposed to the countries concerned to organize an international committee for adjustment, the Portuguese government recently submitted an answer to the British and French governments, agreeing to send personnel to participate, but with reservations: (1) The reservations submitted by Portugal on the 21st of last month should be satisfied by the countries concerned. (2) How the powers of the adjustment committee should be strictly limited in accordance with the reservations submitted by the countries concerned. (3) This committee should have the power to carry out its tasks. (4) This committee should maintain a spirit of fairness and impartiality. According to the reservations previously submitted by Portugal on the 21st of last month, there are a total of three items: (1) The non-interference agreement should be strictly implemented, and the Soviet Union should also participate. (2) Portugal is not a military producer and can only prohibit the transfer of military supplies to Spain. (3) The civil strife in Spain endangers the security of Portugal more than other countries, so Portugal's security must obtain considerable guarantees. (5th, Havas)</p>
<h3>Fifty Provinces in Spain: Government Fully Controls Eighteen Provinces; Rebels Occupy Fifteen Provinces</h3>
<p>Madrid. Min Sheng Bao recently reported that of the 50 provinces in the country, 18 provinces are currently fully controlled by the government, with a total population of 11.5 million and an area of 157,293 square kilometers.

The shells required by the National Army are taken from Seville, firearms are taken from Cadiz, and gunpowder is taken from Granada, so there is no need to worry about shortages.

<h3>Mexico Restores Silver Standard</h3>
<p>(London) The Mexican government issued an order in April of last year to nationalize silver and prohibit the export of silver coins, while issuing more banknotes to circulate in the market. At the time, this measure was taken because Mexico was deeply concerned that silver coins would flow out in large quantities after the United States raised the price of silver. At the beginning of this year, the United States and Mexico concluded a silver agreement stipulating that the US Treasury would purchase silver produced in Mexico. The Mexican government, therefore, ordered on the 30th of last month, in accordance with this agreement, to repeal the above order. As a result, the peso silver coin, which had been suspended for a long time, also re-circulated in the market from the 1st of this month. The "National Socialist Magazine" here has praised this decision by Mexico and compared the currency situation of China and Mexico because the Chinese government implemented a new currency policy in November of last year. The magazine also said that Mexico is the world's largest silver producer, and after the government re-circulates silver coins in the market, it will be able to provide considerable assistance to the domestic silver mining industry. In addition, since the establishment of the US-Mexico agreement, the outside world has been worried that the United States may purchase a large amount of silver in Mexico. Today's decision in Mexico can eliminate this worry. The magazine concluded that since the silver policies of the United States and Mexico have been unified, it will have a good impact on the silver markets of various countries in the future, especially the London silver market.

<h3>The Supreme Court Sees a Sharp Increase in Criminal Appeals Over the Years</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Since the establishment of the Supreme Court at the end of 1927, criminal appeals have increased sharply. According to statistics over the years, 1,860 cases were received in 1928, 2,590 cases in 1929, 3,251 cases in 1930, 2,896 cases in 1931, 4,777 cases in 1932, 5,789 cases in 1933, 5,919 cases in 1934, and 10,155 cases in 1935. From January to May of this year, 4,568 cases have been received, with an average monthly intake of slightly less than 914 cases, indicating that this year will reach more than 10,000 cases. In summary and comparison, the number of criminal appeals has increased almost every year, and this year's number continues to increase without any reduction. The number of cases concluded each year has also increased with the trend of case intake. From January to May of this year, 3,995 cases have been concluded, with an average monthly conclusion of about 800 cases, which is more than in previous years. The number of pending cases is only about 5,000. Recently, each court has set a deadline for clearing old cases from 1935, and all have been completed by the end of June of this year. Afterwards, each court will handle new cases received this year, and the time difference between receipt and conclusion will be at most six months. Given the sharp increase in criminal appeals in the third instance, it seems that the current Code of Criminal Procedure should be revised. The fundamental solution is to reduce the root causes of crime, which is a matter of social policy, and cannot be achieved by criminal policy alone. (Central News Agency dispatch of the 5th)</p>

<h3>The Northern Navigation Company to Hold a Shareholders' Meeting Today</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Northern Navigation Company will hold a shareholders' meeting on the 6th to decide on its business direction. According to Manager Li of the company, the Northern Wheel ran aground off Haifeng this spring, stranding for more than a month. The Northern Fu Wheel collided with a Japanese fishing boat in the Korean Strait, resulting in compensation for the two losses, as well as accumulated losses of more than 200,000 yuan over the years. Recently, with the introduction of Yongyuan Company, a Japanese firm, a loan of 200,000 yuan was obtained from Jinghe Bank to cover the expenses. However, due to sluggish business and the inability to repay the loan, the Northern, Northern Hua, and Northern Fu ships have been rented out or used as collateral for debts, and are now managed by Yongyuan. The company has decided to downsize and continue business with the Northern Kang and Northern Ping ships. The reorganization of the company and the possible introduction of Japanese capital will be discussed and decided at the shareholders' meeting on the 6th. Due to smuggling and the boycott of Chinese merchant ships by Japanese puppet regimes, North China shipping is nearing its end, and everyone is struggling. (Special dispatch of the 5th)</p>

<h3>The Far East Crisis is Approaching Daily; The British in Hong Kong Make Military Preparations, Increase the Strength of Their Land, Sea, and Air Forces, and Intensify Air Defense and Anti-Poison Gas Work</h3>
<p>Shantou correspondence: Hong Kong is an isolated island on the southern shore of the Pacific Ocean, connected to the various islands in the Lingdingyang. It is only a narrow strip of water away from Macau, Guangzhou, and Shantou. It is the primary gateway for European merchants to the Far East. In recent years, the world situation has changed drastically. The League of Nations, which was based on peace, has been shattered by militarists. The Nine-Power Treaty and the London Naval Treaty are no longer in effect. Hong Kong, in order to be prepared for danger in times of peace, conducted large-scale air defense exercises in 1934 and 1935. As a result, the imaginary enemy's air force launched a night attack and dropped countless poison bombs on government agencies, shipyards, military industries, and important areas. Almost every district in Hong Kong was devastated. This is a past fact. The military authorities, having received this serious warning, intensified the development of the Hong Kong-Singapore air routes, linking them with the Singapore-Australia and Dutch East Indies air routes. They also increased the air force by two squadrons and the army by two divisions. The military center is located in the Kowloon New Territories area, which is connected to Bao'an County in Guangdong Province. At the same time, they strengthened the defense of the fortresses on various islands at sea. New-style cannons and anti-aircraft guns were re-installed on the surrounding island fortresses. At the strategic entrances and exits such as Ang Chong Chau, Lei Yue Mun, and Kap Shui Mun, Shandong stone-blasting workers and Malayan workers with experience in building military ports in Singapore were hired to rush the construction of tunnels, pillboxes, and other works day and night. In the Kowloon Peninsula and the New Territories, a huge airfield capable of accommodating 500 airplanes taking off and landing at the same time is being built. The mountainsides nearby have been hollowed out to create underground hangars and storage depots for fuel, military equipment, and food. Military facilities have also been set up in the valleys around the Shing Mun Reservoir, with a deadline for completion within this year. Close connections are being established with the sea and air defenses of Singapore and Australia.</p>
<p>It is noted that Hong Kong was previously restricted by the 1922 Washington Treaty and could not strengthen its armed self-defense capabilities. All the garrisons and equipment were only sufficient to maintain local security. This year, the British military authorities, in view of the approaching Far East crisis, decided to allocate 20 million yuan from the Ministry of Finance to build barracks in the New Territories. The location has been designated for construction in the Kowloon wilderness, capable of accommodating six new regiments (approximately 6,000 men per regiment), and is connected to the Fanling Air Force base. The temporary barracks on the seaside of Sham Shui Po and Cheung Sha Wan will be removed and converted into residential areas. The Indian barracks on Nathan Road in Kowloon will also be relocated after the new barracks are built, to avoid the mixing of military and civilians. It is noted that Hong Kong currently has four British regiments. If six regiments are added, the number of troops will be over 60,000, and the strength of the defense will be more than sufficient. The Second Battalion of the Lancashire Regiment will be transferred to Singapore next month and replaced by troops from Scotland and Palestine. Heavy artillery units, anti-aircraft guns, searchlights, and chemical warfare teams have already arrived in batches this spring and are continuing to arrive by ship. It is said that the new soldiers are using the latest modern equipment. They disembark at the Taikoo Dockyard and move into the arsenal for storage. Two to three thousand people work in the Taikoo Naval Dockyard every day. In order to prevent spies from entering and exploring military secrets, the British authorities are photographing and registering all Chinese and foreign workers, taking fingerprints, and issuing certificates. Those who mix in without this certificate and look around will be prosecuted as spies. This shows that the military preparations are generally very strict.</p>
<p>As for the implementation of air defense and anti-poison gas work, it is the most pressing task in Hong Kong at present. Because of the 940,000 residents in Hong Kong, Chinese people account for more than 90%. Therefore, many Chinese doctors, nurses, English-speaking students, and young workers are registering to join the rescue team. In addition, small booklets from the London Anti-Gas Association are printed in Chinese and distributed to residents. Plans are also being made that all newly built residential buildings must have a separate gas defense room. The Air Defense Committee meets once a month and has now drafted a plan that, in the event of war and attack, all residents except police and civil servants who remain in Hong Kong will be moved to Kowloon and reside in large mountain caves. The mountains have safety facilities and can be dispersed and hidden to avoid crowding. For example, a certain mountain can accommodate 170,000 people. There is a sufficient supply of drinking water and food in the mountains to continuously supply the refugees without shortages. The government has also divided the entire Hong Kong into 40 districts, each district storing food and building covered water pools to ensure that they are not contaminated by poisonous gas. The Anti-Gas Association will also select suitable and safe areas in all districts of Hong Kong to build gas shelters so that transportation, electrical, and gas workers can work inside without being poisoned. As for when the enemy attacks, the government will issue a warning signal 30 minutes in advance. As soon as the signal sounds, the Hong Kong Red Cross ambulance and fire brigade will immediately prepare to move out. At present, rubber factories in Hong Kong are ordered to rush to produce gas masks, each set costing more than three yuan. Type A is for soldiers, Type B is for civil servants to use in and out, and Type C is for residents. These masks are being manufactured as quickly as possible and purchased and stored by the government. In October of this year, there will be a very large-scale air defense and anti-poison gas drill. In addition, there is a ten-year air defense plan. The government intends to order all landlords in Hong Kong to build a gas defense room on the second and third floors, and allocate another 1.5 million yuan to build a public gas defense facility. As for the densely populated areas, the government has limited the number of residents per building, preparing to open Lantau Island as a working-class industrial area, reducing land taxes and rates, and dispersing the working-class residents of Hong Kong to avoid temporary chaos and disorder.</p>
<p>According to a Hong Kong English-language telegram, it was learned from responsible sources that the Air Defense Committee recently organized in Hong Kong has drafted a plan to temporarily relocate all residents in the event of an air raid after many discussions. The scale of this plan will be unprecedented in the history of modern warfare. It is planned to pre-build three residential areas in the small mountains around Kowloon, which can accommodate a total of 1 million people. The houses will be scattered and strive to be distanced and not connected. Each small group will live in one place, and the food and drinking water will be supplied by the authorities. In case of emergency, only the police and public utilities personnel will remain in town. Therefore, in the event of an air raid, many lives can be saved from poisoning.</p>
<p>The most frightening thing about air raids is poison gas. The Anti-Gas Committee has formulated a defense plan for this. The most important thing is to ensure the safety of public utilities personnel, such as electricity, gas, water, transportation, and telephone workers. It is planned to select locations throughout Hong Kong and prepare suitable buildings to accommodate these people, so that they can serve safely inside, immune to bombs and gas. Secondly, there is concern for civilians. The committee guarantees (1) to clearly mark all first and second floors of public and private buildings that are easily and quickly converted into gas shelters so that they can be quickly converted in case of emergency, (2) to ensure that drinking water and food are free from gas poisoning, (3) to train the public with a recognized warning signal so that the people know to avoid sudden air raids when the alarm sounds, (4) to continuously practice the rescue of the injured by rescue teams, doctors, and fire brigades during air raids so that they are familiar with their special duties, and (5) to manufacture an effective gas mask so that people can easily purchase it.</p>
<p>As for gas masks, negotiations are currently underway with rubber factories to manufacture them, striving to keep the price low so that even the poor can afford one. These masks will be manufactured roughly according to the British style and will be divided into three classes. The first class is an absolute protective mask, with clothing, exclusively for wartime use. The second class is a temporary protective mask for public utilities personnel. The third class is a partially protective mask for civilian use. Ordinary gas masks, such as those supplied to civilians in the UK, protect the lungs from the toxicity of mustard gas but cannot protect the body. Gas masks and rubber clothing supplied to public utilities personnel can temporarily protect the inside and outside of the body. As for those for wartime use, they can permanently protect the body. The masks prepared by the Hong Kong Volunteer Defense Corps are completely identical to those prepared by the regular army. Mustard gas and similar gases are the most severe in gas warfare because, after these gases are dispersed, their poison can remain in the air for several days. Hydrated lime is the main chemical for sealing mustard gas. Therefore, Hong Kong is currently purchasing a large quantity of hydrated lime for storage.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong authorities do not want to wait until the enemy bombs them before retaliating. Those responsible for defense for the past twelve months have been actively working to complete the defense plan formulated two years ago. Throughout Hong Kong, especially in the New Territories, anti-aircraft guns are currently being installed in various strategic locations to defend against air raids. According to non-official estimates, the cost of defending against poison gas in Hong Kong is approximately 1.5 million yuan, not including the cost of land, sea, and air defense.</p>
<h3>Agreed-upon Method for Exporting Alkali Salt; 70,000 Tons to be Shipped Out This Month; Selling Price of Approximately Two Yuan and Six Jiao Per Ton</h3>
<p>Tianjin correspondence: The matter of exporting alkali salt to Japan has been negotiated for several days by the Alkali Salt Export Affairs Office under the Changlu Salt Transport Commissioner's Office, the Lufeng Company, and Sino-Japanese related organizations such as Mitsubishi and Iwai. The contract has been signed, with a tax of one yuan per ton and a total cost of three yuan per ton for salt and miscellaneous items. The Changlu Salt Transport Commissioner's Office telegraphed the Ministry of Finance on the 3rd to order the Tianjin Customs to supervise the transportation. Mitsubishi Company is currently recruiting barges and starting packing. It is expected that it can be shipped out in mid-month. The second batch will be 70,000 tons. This year's transportation will stop at this number. Next year, 1.2 million tons will be transported. The Hangu salt flats are 120 li from the Tanggu steamboat pier. Barge transportation is inconvenient. Mitsubishi Company has specially requested the Tianjin Japanese Consulate to consult with our Hebei-Chahar Construction Committee to build a section of highway from Hangu to Tanggu so that heavy-duty trucks can pass. The Construction Committee has approved this. An engineer was specially dispatched to survey the route. It can be constructed in the near future. The terms of the alkali salt export contract signed jointly by the Alkali Salt Export Office, Lufeng Company, and Mitsubishi and Iwai are as follows: (1) The export of 70,000 tons of alkali salt this year. (2) The national tax is two yuan per ton. (3) The price per ton is two yuan and six jiao (the weight is converted into odd expenses, and each ton is approximately equivalent to 0.4 yuan). (4) Transportation is only allowed after the national tax, salt price, and miscellaneous fees have been paid. (5) This contract is valid after being signed by both parties and submitted to the Chinese competent authorities for approval. In addition to this contract, the Special Office and the Lufeng Company have separately entered into a contract restricting the exclusive sale, ship loading, and private sale in various coastal areas. Everything is handled in accordance with the orders of the Ministry of Finance to prevent abuses. Regarding this matter, according to Liu Renfu, section chief of the Export Special Office, the specific measures for exporting alkali salt to Japan have been negotiated and settled. Only trivial issues remain, and they will be completely determined within days. The 70,000 tons purchased by the Japanese side can be shipped out within 10 days. The method of loading and transporting is to first load the salt from the salt flats into barges, and then load it from Tanggu into large steamships. The Lufeng Company has hired packing, weighing, and transportation workers to prepare for use at the salt flats. The salt price was originally set at four yuan per ton. Because the Japanese merchants repeatedly requested a reduction, the result was only two yuan and six jiao per ton, which can be said to be extremely cheap. The collection of salt tax is calculated based on the metric ton set by the Ministry of Finance and converted into the new market scale, which is approximately 24 dan per ton in the new scale. If the commonly used new market ton is approximately equivalent to 20 dan. The old market ton implemented at the Hangu salt flats is approximately equivalent to 16 dan. None of these will be adopted. The newly appointed Changlu Salt Transport Commissioner Li Hanhua went to Peiping on the 3rd to meet Song Zheyuan and discuss this matter. To prevent the exported salt from being transferred to the coastal areas for sale, the Tianjin Customs will supervise the loading of ships. However, this official document has not yet been issued by the Ministry of Finance and the Shanghai General Taxation Department. It is expected that the loading and transportation can be carried out around the 15th of this month without further delay. The alkali salt shipped out this time is produced in Hangu and has been accumulated in the salt flats for many years. Although the salt households complain that the price is too low, they are not strongly opposed because there is cash available. However, the Tanggu salt flats feel that the price is too low and refuse to sell in bulk. This year, there is no need for salt produced in that area. The Special Office has not paid attention to this. When exporting next year, the salt produced in that salt flat has been set within the sales volume, so some negotiation is necessary before a deal can be reached. (4th)</p>
<h3>He Yingqin Flew to Shanghai Yesterday to Visit Huang Fu, Who is Sick</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) - He Yingqin flew to Shanghai at 4:10 PM on the 5th via China Aviation. He was accompanied only by a secretary and an aide. It is reported that he went to visit Mr. Huang Yingbai, who is ill, and to handle his personal affairs. He will return to Nanjing in a day or two.</p>
<h3>Extension of Factory and Company Registration Deadline</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Instructs the Jianghai Customs to Handle It; The Chamber of Commerce Has Negotiated a Flexible Solution.</p>
<p>To prevent smuggling, the Ministry of Finance has established inspection methods for imported foreign goods and domestic goods being transported and sold. It is also stipulated that factory numbers and companies engaged in the same type of goods as those specified by the ministry must register with the customs and obtain a license to issue transportation and sales permits. Since receiving the order to handle this matter, many manufacturers and companies in the city have applied for registration, but many have not done so due to unclear procedures. Now that the regulatory deadline has passed, the customs has refused to accept these applications. Therefore, many manufacturers have requested the Chamber of Commerce to find a way to provide relief.</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, in addition to telegraphing the Ministry of Finance to request an extension, also had Ge Jiecai, the director of the Inspection Committee of the Chamber, negotiate alternative methods with the customs. According to Mr. Ge, he has already negotiated this matter with the customs authorities. To take the actual situation into consideration, those who have not registered can state the reason for the delay and report it to their respective trade associations, which will then forward it to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for a letter of verification, which will be handled with flexibility.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has also replied, stating in its original text, "I have received the telegram about the extension. I have already instructed the Customs Administration to telegraph the Tax Department to investigate and handle it. Please be informed." Therefore, factory numbers and companies that have not registered should quickly declare their reasons to the trade association, otherwise, it will affect the transportation and sale of their goods.</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Negotiates Loans with Bank of China, Communications Bank, etc.</h3>
<p>First Establish a Grain Depot with One Million Yuan; Discuss a Five Million Yuan Collateral Loan After the Depot is Completed. Qian Chengxin Has Returned to Nanchang to Report on the Negotiation Process.</p>
<p>The Jiangxi Provincial Industrial and Commercial Administration plans to borrow six million yuan from the Bank of China, the Communications Bank, the Farmers Bank of China, and the Jiangxi Yumin Bank to build agricultural warehouses and handle collateral loans. Qian Chengxin, the deputy manager of Jiangxi Yumin Bank, was entrusted to negotiate with the banks, and it is hoped that this will be successful. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Building Grain Depots and Handling Collateral Loans</h3>
<p>In order to revive the rural areas of Jiangxi, the Industrial and Commercial Administration plans to build agricultural warehouses. The locations for the provincial warehouses have been determined to be in Nanchang, Ji'an, Ganzhou, Linchuan, Zhangshuzhen, Guixi, Tupu, Poyang, and other places. One county warehouse will be established in each of the 83 counties in the province, to be completed in two phases. The first phase, which includes 53 counties such as Xiushui, will be completed before the end of October. The second phase, which includes 30 counties such as Wuzhen, will be completed before the end of November. Six million yuan will be borrowed from the Bank of China, the Communications Bank, the Farmers Bank of China, and the Jiangxi Yumin Bank, with one million yuan used for the construction of provincial warehouses and five million yuan used for collateral loans for each warehouse. Xiao Chunjin, a member of the Provincial Government and director of the Administration, negotiated with the above banks and received their approval in principle.</p>
<h3>Six Million Yuan Loan Agreed Upon</h3>
<p>Qian Chengxin, the deputy manager of Jiangxi Yumin Bank, who also serves as the director of the Shanghai office, was ordered to negotiate a six million yuan loan with the Shanghai headquarters of the Bank of China and the Communications Bank. The Provincial Government's opinion is that the loan term should be ten years with a monthly interest rate of 8%. However, the banks believe that they should be responsible for the construction of the provincial warehouses and handle the collateral loans directly. Mr. Qian returned to Nanchang the day before yesterday to report to the Provincial Government and is scheduled to come to Shanghai again in two weeks. The initial discussion will focus on establishing a one million yuan construction loan, and after the warehouses are completed, the collateral loan will be discussed.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Reducing Rickshaws Opposed by All Parties</h3>
<p>Must be Proportional to Various Vehicles.</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement proposed reducing public rickshaws, the Rickshaw Association of the Special District, concerned about the vital interests of rickshaw owners and pullers, drafted three reasons why rickshaws should not be reduced and requested the Chinese directors to negotiate. The Rickshaw Special Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council held a meeting yesterday, attended by Fan Keling, Fei Dingsheng, Yu Qiaqing, Jiang Yiping, and Kaifu Huier. Fan Keling chaired the meeting. As a result of the discussion, the majority did not agree to reduce the number of rickshaws, so it was not formally passed. It was decided to hold another meeting on the afternoon of the 13th at 4:00 PM to discuss the matter further. The Rickshaw Association of the Special District will also hold a meeting soon to discuss measures and make recommendations. The Special Committee has rejected the proposal.</p>
<p>A Westerner named STK also suggested to the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday that the reduction of public rickshaws should be rejected. Public rickshaws should be treated equally with buses, trams, private cars, bicycles, private rickshaws, and public cars in order to benefit the working class. If a reduction is desired, it must be proportional to all vehicles in order to be fair.</p>
<h3>Labor Strikes at Three British and American Factories to Prevent Expansion</h3>

<p>According to Da Gong She, after the entire workforce of more than 2,600 employees, including staff, machinists, and laborers, at the Third British and American Factory (now renamed Yuanchong Tobacco Company) went on strike, the strike has continued for two weeks without a resolution. To prevent the labor strike from expanding, the municipal party and government agencies held a meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau in the city center at 10:00 AM yesterday to discuss preventive measures. Zhou Funong, the director of the People's Movement Section of the Municipal Party Department, Xu Yefu, the director of the Third Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, Wang Xianqing, the director of the Mediation Division, and Jin Zhongjian, a staff member of the Second Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, attended the meeting. The meeting lasted for a long time, and concrete decisions have been made to prevent the expansion of the labor strike. The contents cannot be announced.</p>
<h3>Meeting Situation</h3>
<p>The Municipal General Labor Union held a regular meeting at its headquarters at 2:00 PM yesterday. Zhu Xuefan, Zhou Xuexiang, Long Peiyun, Zhang Kechang, Gong Yuting, Ye Xianggao, Shui Xiangyun, Lu Muqin, and Hu Menglin were elected to be responsible for coordinating with the party and government agencies to handle the matter.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Mediation</h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has scheduled a meeting for tomorrow morning (the 7th) at 10:00 AM to convene both labor and management, and has requested the Municipal Party Department and the Public Security Bureau to organize a mediation committee to conduct mediation in accordance with the revised Regulations on Handling Labor Disputes. If mediation fails or the factory refuses to attend, the Municipal Government will be requested to submit the matter to arbitration in order to resolve the dispute as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Hunan Provincial Government Borrows 1.4 Million Yuan from Three Banks</h3>
<p>Hunan Finance Department Concludes Draft Agreement with Changsha Branch; Awaits Headquarters Approval Before Signing Date Can Be Set</p>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, He Haoruo, the director of the Hunan Provincial Department of Finance, came to Shanghai in the middle of last month to negotiate with the authorities of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Communications Bank to borrow 2 million yuan to repay old debts and reorganize the province's finances. After each bank expressed its acceptance of the loan principle, Director He returned to Hunan and continued to negotiate detailed terms such as the amount, collateral, interest rate, and term with the Changsha branches of the Bank of China, Communications Bank, and other banks. According to sources in the banking industry, the loan is progressing smoothly. Recently, it has been agreed that the total loan amount will be changed to 1.4 million yuan, with 1 million yuan face value of Hunan Provincial Construction Bonds and 1.8 million yuan face value of Provincial Public Bonds as collateral, a monthly interest rate of 1%, and monthly repayments of 50,000 yuan, to be repaid in 28 months. Detailed reports on the loan will arrive in Shanghai soon. Whether there will be any changes to the total loan amount and term will depend on the approval of the Bank of China, Communications Bank, and other banks after the reports arrive in Shanghai, and then the contract will be signed on a scheduled date.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Province Levies Cotton Improvement Fee; Yarn Association Telegraphed Request to Stop It</h3>
<p>The Chinese Cotton Yarn Association sent a telegram to President Jiang of the Nanjing Executive Yuan (Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance, Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry, and the National Economic Committee): According to reports, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction recently established a Cotton Production Improvement Office in Nantong to improve cotton production. In the Jiangbei cotton area, an improvement fee of 20 cents per picul is levied, which is paid by the cotton firms to the local Farmers Bank. Only after obtaining proof of payment can transportation be allowed. In our opinion, improving cotton production is an urgent task, but the government's income from land taxes and cotton yarn consolidated taxes is not insignificant, and various provinces have improved cotton production earlier than Jiangsu, with the required funds mostly coming from the national treasury and provincial treasury, and no fees have ever been levied on cotton. Now, Jiangsu Province is the first to set a bad example, indirectly increasing the cost of yarn mills, which seems to be inappropriate in both law and reason. Moreover, since the central government implemented the reduction of exorbitant taxes two years ago, no taxes can be levied arbitrarily on any goods. It is unknown whether the cotton fee levied by Jiangsu Province has been submitted to the central government for approval, but it is undoubtedly a form of exorbitant tax. Therefore, we sincerely request that you promptly instruct the Jiangsu Provincial Government to stop the method of levying an improvement fee of 20 cents per picul by the Cotton Production Improvement Office of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction in order to maintain the law and alleviate the difficulties of businesses. We are extremely grateful. The Chinese Cotton Yarn Association kowtows.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Transportation Orders Employment of Merchant Marine Graduates; Attached List of Graduates</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Maritime Administration received Instruction No. 3163 from the Ministry of Transportation yesterday, ordering it to instruct various shipping companies to employ this year's graduates of the Wusong Merchant Marine School as much as possible, and a list of names was attached. The original instruction is excerpted below:</p>
<h3>Order of the Ministry of Transportation</h3>
<p>The Wusong Merchant Marine School is the only institution in our country that trains maritime talents. The students have undergone four years of training, and their performance is excellent. At a time when there is a shortage of maritime talents in the country, all shipping companies should employ these graduates as much as possible in order to uphold the purpose of the Ministry in establishing the school. It has been found that this year's students in the navigation and marine engineering departments who have been approved to graduate total 37. In addition to separate orders, a list of names is attached, ordering the bureau to instruct various shipping companies to employ them as much as possible and report back for future reference. This order, Deputy Minister of Transportation acting as Minister Yu Feipeng,</p>
<h3>Attached List</h3>
<p>Navigation Department (21 persons): Gao Wenhua, Chen Honggao, Cheng Zexuan, Mou Shouxin, Wang Weiyao, Feng Ren, Zhou Bixiang, Wang Junshan, Lu Liangji, Zhu Jinchang, Liu Jiaji, Tang Zhenying, Wang He, Yang Yifu, Du Bingqin, Zhou Xiaoda, Ma Jieyuan, Mao Lixian, Lin Liangtao, Lu Zhiwen.</p>
<p>Marine Engineering Department (16 persons): Chen Wanming, Zhang Yujun, Lin Shao, Ye Tianhan, Qiu Shanbao, Pan Xiaoyi, Ye Wugao, Nie Xiguang, Sha Heng, Zhao Shuyi, Zha De, Zheng Changzuo, Wang Yedong, Yu Luyu, Gong Dihui, Zai Guoju.</p>
<h3>All Ships of Northern Company Sold to Japanese Business</h3>
<p>To be Implemented After Approval by Shareholders' Meeting. According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the headquarters of the Northern Navigation Company is located in Tianjin and has six ships: Bei'an (freighter, gross tonnage 3,586 tons, net tonnage 2,600 tons, built in 1920), Beitai (Shanghai-Tianjin route, gross tonnage 2,040 tons, net tonnage 1,291 tons, built in 1879), Beifu (Shanghai-Tianjin connecting route, gross tonnage 1,975 tons, net tonnage 1,221 tons, built in 1902), Beihua (Shanghai-Tianjin express route, gross tonnage 1,379 tons, net tonnage 848 tons, built in 1905), Beikang (Tianjin-Yingkou route, gross tonnage 1,015 tons, net tonnage 629 tons, built in 1919), and Beiping (Tianjin-Yingkou route, gross tonnage 711 tons, net tonnage 419 tons, built in 1905). Due to restrictions imposed by the Puppet Manchukuo and the squeeze from Japanese businesses, losses have reached 300,000 yuan, making it impossible to maintain operations. It has been negotiated with the Dalian Yongyuan Shipping Company of Japan to sell the company to the Japanese business. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the Shanghai branch of the Northern Company yesterday morning that the price has been agreed upon, but because this matter is related to the whole company, the company has scheduled a shareholders' meeting in Tianjin on the 6th to discuss it. After approval, the sales contract will be formally signed.</p>
<h3>General Labor Union Investigates Bogus Organizations</h3>
<p>According to Da Gong She, the Municipal General Labor Union has recently discovered unscrupulous traitors who have falsely organized a "Shanghai Citywide Workers United Office" in order to deceive workers. It has been verified that there are only individual organizations of occupational and industrial unions in this city, which are all led by the "Shanghai Municipal General Labor Union," and there is no organization called "Shanghai Citywide Workers United Office." In addition to solemnly declaring this to all sectors of society, the union has also requested the party and government agencies to quickly investigate the matter thoroughly.</p>
<h3>Japanese Consul General Horiuchi in Tianjin Bids Farewell to Mayor Wu</h3>

<h3>Citizens' Association Asks Shanghai Municipal Council to Install Street Lights on Mabai Road</h3>
<p>The 43rd Branch of the Citizens' Association of the First Special District sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday, stating: "According to a letter from our member, the China Funeral Home, our building was constructed on Mabai Road, Gordon Road, and the Shanghai Municipal Council assigned the address 34 Mabai Road. Since the completion of the project at the end of August 24, we have been paying property taxes quarterly, totaling 287.7 yuan. We have repeatedly requested the Shanghai Municipal Council to install street lights on Mabai Road and open up the road, because the road connects to Gordon Road on one side and Robison Road on the other, which is essential to facilitating traffic. However, nothing has been done for more than a year. We believe that taxpayers who have fulfilled their obligations should enjoy their rights, so we request you to forward this letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council to expedite the opening of the road and the installation of street lights in order to facilitate traffic and balance rights and obligations."</p>
<p>The letter goes on to say, "After investigation, Mabai Road is an important thoroughfare in the Western District and does need to be opened up as soon as possible. Your bureau has always paid close attention to transportation projects and should be able to approve our request. We are writing to inform you of the situation and hope that you will investigate and respond accordingly."</p>
<h3>Cixi County Reduces Rent; Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association Sends Letter Requesting Correction</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association in Shanghai sent a letter to the Yinxian District Administrative Inspectorate, stating: "According to letters from Jin Yan, representative of the Zhenhai Ye Family Charitable Estate; Fang Zhiyuan, representative of the Fang Family Charitable Estate; Fang Jisheng, representative of Guangrentang; Shen Kaiming, representative of the Ye Shude Hall; representatives from Fang Yuqing Hall, Zhang Yongsitang, Fang Gongdafang, Fang Gongerfang, Fang Gongsanfang; Zhuang Qianyu, representative of the Cixi Hu Yudetang; Ying Qiao, representative of Sheng Guihoutang; Zhang Shenzhi, representative of the Zhang Shimin Charitable Estate; Zhang Weijun, representative of the Zhang Shanshutang; Gu Pinzhang, representative of the Gu Shanshutang; and Zhang Xu, representative of the Yan Shuzhi Villa Zhang Kunfang, our estates are all public welfare groups that manage charitable undertakings, provide relief to the poor and out-of-school children, and provide food rations to orphans and the needy. Our livelihoods have always depended on land rent. Since the government promulgated the 25% rent reduction decree, our estates have felt the impact, but in order to respect government orders, we have tried our best to overcome the difficulties and lived in peace. This year, thanks to the blessing of heaven, the autumn harvest in each county has been bountiful, which has been rare in recent years. Our estates hope to use this year's abundant harvest to make up for the lean years in the past. We were just about to go to the countryside to collect rent when, unexpectedly, the Cixi County Farmers' Association and the township heads of Cidong arbitrarily determined exceptional rent reduction amounts, such as 70% or 73% reduction, or a social payment of more than 20 or 30 catties per mu, and submitted them to the county for the record. The Cixi County Government did not correct them according to law, but instead issued commendations, approvals, and proclamations, which caused a wave of resistance from tenants to pay rent, which is deeply regrettable. An abundant harvest is an undeniable fact this year. There should be no dispute apart from the 25% rent reduction. The county farmers' association and the township heads disregarded the law and facts, illegally assessed the rent, and arbitrarily determined unilateral benefits, which violated Article 8 of the detailed rules for the implementation of the revised Provisional Measures for 25% Rent Reduction for Tenants in Zhejiang Province, which states that 'Any organization or individual who violates these measures, coerces or defrauds farmers, or takes advantage of the 25% rent reduction for personal gain, or incites farmers to delay or resist rent, will be punished according to law.' The government's orders are so clear to us, but the actions of the county farmers' association and the township heads are the opposite, causing our estates to be shocked. If we say that we are using new weighing instruments, we should invite the owners to participate in this rent assessment agreement and publicly evaluate it. Moreover, the use of new weighing instruments did not start in Cixi. Yinxian has already implemented it and issued a proclamation ordering tenants to pay rent in accordance with the law, with 75% as the standard (i.e., 75 catties per 100 catties per mu per year after deducting the 25%). When using new scales, add 11 catties per 100 catties, which is equivalent to 15 taels and 3 mace of the old scales. That is, each tenant should pay 86 catties per mu according to the new scale. After deducting 3 catties of accumulated grain per mu, the actual rent is 83 catties per mu, which is appropriate and avoids disputes. Cixi and Yin are both under the jurisdiction of Ningbo, and the handling should be the same. In short, this year's abundant harvest and the use of rent assessment are close to inciting people, and even if new scales are used, there are precedents in Yinxian to follow, so there is no need for controversy. The county farmers' association is controlled by a small number of people, and the township heads are mostly兼任 by tenants, so their actions are impure. The Cixi County Chief, who presides over the orders of a county, approved and proclaimed these illegal actions, disregarding the laws of the provincial government and local customs, which is perplexing to our estates. However, the illegality of this case has a direct impact on our estates, and if neighboring counties follow suit, the disputes will increase. In addition to submitting the details to the Yinxian District Administrative Inspectorate, we are writing to state the reasons and ask you to uphold justice and find a way to correct the situation."</p>
<p>The letter goes on to say, "After investigation, the rent standard has long been followed by the government's 25% rent reduction decree in various places, and there has always been peace. Now, the farmers' association and township heads are maintaining unilateral interests and arbitrarily assessing the rent reduction, which seems to violate Article 8 of the implementation rules of the revised Provisional Measures for 25% Rent Reduction for Tenants in Zhejiang Province. As for the use of new weighing instruments and the estimated increase, there are precedents in Yinxian that can be used. According to the letter, we request you to review it, quickly order a correction, maintain charity, prevent disputes, and look forward to a reply."</p>

<h3>Dong Xingwu et al. Swallowed Raw Opium</h3>
<p>Chen Shusheng, a household registration police officer at the Yimiao Police Station, was ordered to spare no effort in carrying out lower-level anti-drug work, such as reporting the registration of domestic smokers and investigating the consumption of strong narcotics. As the deadline for reporting, September 10, is approaching, he has been urging household police to conduct strict inspections and to thoroughly interrogate "swallows" who falsely claim to have smoking permits. Yesterday afternoon, while inspecting No. 49 Guanyinge Street, he found that Dong Xingwu, Yuan Baosheng, and Yang Asan had the appearance of smokers. When asked if they were smoking opium, they denied it. A thorough search yielded no evidence. However, according to someone, they were all swallowing raw opium. When questioned, they admitted the truth. Because they had not registered, they were taken to the police station for verification. After interrogation, they were sent to the bureau for legal action.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau to Help the Poor; Plans to Expand Loan Program; Increase Original Loan Fund; Add Two Locations in the British and French Concessions</h3>
<p>In recent years, due to the economic downturn and increased unemployment, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau is actively expanding the loan program in various districts in order to help the poor and add two loan program locations in the concession areas. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Existing Expansion</h3>
<p>In addition to the two directly managed loan programs in Nanshi and Zhabei, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has entrusted the offices of the municipal committee members in various districts such as Pudong, Gaoqiao, Yangjing, Jiangwan, Wusong, Pengpu, and Fahua to handle loans. The loan amounts range from 5 yuan to 20 yuan, as their purpose is to help the poor make a living. The funds are allocated by the municipal treasury at any time. Due to the current economic downturn, industrial and commercial decline, and increased unemployment, the bureau plans to expand the existing loan program in order to achieve the goal of helping the poor.</p>
<h3>Addition in Concessions</h3>
<p>Due to the restrictions on the residents of the concession areas in terms of residency and guarantors, they have not been able to obtain loans, causing the citizens of the concession to regretfully sigh and look forward to it. In order to completely solve this problem, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has decided to add two loan program locations in the First Special District (International Settlement) and the Second Special District (French Concession). The plan has been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval, and the budget for loan funds is currently being prepared. As for the loan procedures, they will be the same as those in Nanshi and Zhabei</p>

<p>Sports News: Shen Siliang Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning – Discussing the Reasons for the Failure at the World Games – Inferior Physique and Poor Experience – Preparing for the Next World Games Soon</p>
<p>Mr. Shen Siliang, the Secretary-General of the Chinese delegation to the World Games, having left Germany ahead of schedule, returned to China via the Siberian Railway and arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. A reporter from the Guoguang News Agency visited Mr. Shen at Dehan University yesterday afternoon, who related the following:</p>
<p>Fundamental Issues in Sports</p>
<p>Mr. Shen began by saying that he left Berlin on the 21st of last month, traveled via Siberia, passed through Yuguan, and arrived in Tianjin on Thursday morning (the 3rd). He exchanged views with Mr. Zhang Boling. On the same day, he took a train south. The Guoguang News Agency reporter then asked about his impressions of this trip to Europe. He replied that the elite of our country were completely defeated at the World Games, making the delegation feel that simply promoting sports is not a fundamental solution. It is necessary to improve the physical education of the masses to be effective. In other words, it is necessary to strengthen the physique of the nation, because sports are only one part of the fundamental problem of physical education. We are deeply aware of our physical inferiority, so we must universally promote physical education. The so-called promotion of physical education is not the promotion of sports in the narrow sense. It cannot be achieved simply by holding a few large-scale sports meets. It should be led by the government and assisted by the people. The Sports Advancement Association should naturally only be in an assisting role. As for how to reform the future approach to sports, plans are still being made separately. After Mr. Wang Rutang returns to China, concrete decisions can be made and submitted to the government for implementation.</p>
<p>The Fifteen-Year Plan</p>
<p>As for the so-called fifteen-year plan reported by foreign news agencies, this is also not an accurate statement. The so-called fifteen years was only mentioned when answering a foreign reporter's question about when China's physical education could reach perfection. I replied that it would take about fifteen years. Therefore, the so-called fifteen-year plan is probably a misinterpretation of this. According to my personal observation, China really should not focus solely on school sports but should make it popular among the people. This is not to say that school sports should not be promoted, but they should be given equal importance with mass sports. The foundation of school sports should be in middle school, not university.</p>
<p>Reasons for the Failure at the World Games</p>
<p>As for the failure of our delegation at the World Games, an inferior physique was certainly one reason, but the biggest problems were (1) lack of experience and (2) excessive nervous stimulation. This can be proven by the fact that the results of the representatives were far worse than in the country. For example, in the country, a hundred-meter dash could be completed in 11.2 seconds, but at the World Games, it could not exceed 11.6 seconds. In basketball, out of twenty-four throws, only one went in. During free throws, they couldn't even touch the rim. This was entirely due to excessive nervous stimulation. Before the basketball game started, whether it was overseas Chinese or members of the delegation, everyone was focused on the next day's competition, causing the players to become overly eager to win, which resulted in a departure from their normal state. It will take at least three months for the team members who have experienced this kind of excessive nervous stimulation to recover.</p>
<p>The State of Sports in Germany</p>
<p>In modern Germany, sports have become popular throughout the country. For example, the female javelin champion at this World Games was actually a butcher shop employee, which shows the extent of its popularity. The selection of this delegation involved choosing one person from every five or six hundred people with similar results. This is unlike our country, where we gather the most outstanding individuals from all over the country, which is only a few people. Athletes in Germany not only excel in their results but also have strict discipline and character.</p>
<p>Preparing for the Next World Games Soon</p>
<p>Our country will soon begin preparations for the 1940 World Games to be held in Tokyo. After another round of discussions, this plan can be realized. Generally, a request will be submitted to the government to allocate funds to directly organize it, while the Advancement Association will be in an assisting role. As for the plan to train athletes, talent will first be gathered from all over the country, and then they will be trained separately (not centrally). Training policies will also be changed, with particular emphasis on the athlete's cultivation outside the field. In promoting sports, we should pay attention to the physical training of middle school students. Character and discipline must be cultivated and observed accordingly. In my opinion, it is best to cultivate sports among everyone unconsciously and create a good sports environment. It is best for the Ministry of Education to require all levels of students to have a certain level of physical fitness or credits.</p>
<p>Retaining the Star System</p>
<p>At this point, the Guoguang News Agency reporter returned to the recent public opinion and asked whether the star system would be retained in the future. Mr. Shen replied that the observation gained from this World Games is that our athletes lack fighting spirit, while athletes from other countries have a very strong one. In order to strengthen the fighting spirit, it is still necessary to retain the star system. There is a very good impression that the stars who previously considered themselves extraordinary deeply felt their lack of ability after this setback. They have vowed to practice harder after returning to the country, which shows that the star system is not unfeasible. As for hiring foreign coaches, it will depend on the government's economic capabilities. It is best to achieve this in reality.</p>
<p>Football Attracts Attention</p>
<p>Although this delegation failed to win on the European battleground, its strict discipline and neat order have been highly valued by various countries. In particular, the sharpness of the football team has been praised by the English, the homeland of football. As for basketball players, their individual skills are not inferior to others, and their strength is not behind others. The only difference is that they are not as calm as others.</p>
<p>Regular Meeting to be Held in Early October</p>
<p>The recent telegram about the Sports Association convening a temporary standing committee meeting in Europe is not accurate. Initially, there were many important matters to be discussed in Berlin. However, because most of the standing committee members had not traveled abroad, only informal exchanges of views were made with Committee Members Hao and Wang. The discussion was nothing more than preparing for the next World Games. Now that the entire team is on its way back to the country, after Committee Members Hao and Wang arrive in Shanghai, a regular meeting will be held in Shanghai in early October. At that time, concrete decisions will be made on the above issues, and the report to the government on this participation in the World Games will also be submitted at that time.</p>
<h3>Jingwei Cup Tennis Tournament: Railway Wins the Championship</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 4th) The Jingwei Cup Tennis Championship, organized by the Nanjing Lizhi Society, continued its final match between the Railway and Jinpu teams at 4:00 PM on the 4th. As a result, Guo Qida of the Railway team defeated Fang Xiangyao of the Jinpu team by a score of 3-0. Yu Qixiao of the Railway team forfeited. In total, the Railway team won the championship 3-2. In addition, Li Kaisheng and Ma Shaobo of the society won the right to compete in the men's singles final, scheduled for 4:00 PM on the 6th to compete for the title.</p>
<p>Suzhou Amateur Sports Association News</p>
<p>The Suzhou Amateur Sports Association has organized various competitions, which are highly regarded. Recently, the association has continued to organize the Fourth Suzhou Table Tennis Competition, which has been in preparation for ten days and is scheduled to be held on September 20th at the Puyi Society outside the Changmen Gate.</p>
<p>Advanced Singles Semifinals: Lin Baohua Lost Three Straight Sets; Carson's Retention of the Championship is No Longer a Question; Memorial for Qiu Feihai Game This Afternoon</p>
<p>Carson's retention of the Shanghai Advanced Singles Championship is no longer a question. As a result of yesterday's semi-finals, Lin Baohua was still defeated by him in three straight sets. Therefore, Korasha or Forbes will not be his opponents in the future finals. Yesterday, the French Chamber of Commerce had a large audience, as everyone wanted to see Lin, who had just returned from Europe, with fresh eyes. The most regrettable thing yesterday was that in the second game, when Lin was leading 3-2, the referee made a major mistake. The game that Lin won was recorded incorrectly and was attributed to Carson, making it 3-3. The impact of this one-in-one-out was significant. The situation might have been different. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Lin and Carson's Strokes</p>
<p>Carson's steady and reliable stroke is as good as ever, without any reduction in quality. Except for the comeback in the second game, Carson had an absolute advantage in the second and fourth games. His serve is comparable to Lin's. His high ball and mid-air shots in front of the net are even better than Baohua's. His half-court oblique shot caught Lin off guard in front of the net. Carson's victory over Lin was indeed more than enough. Lin's stroke has made considerable progress in some aspects, but there are not many exciting moments. He failed in many games when he was already in a winning position, which is a great pity. There were many errors and suicides, which is also an important reason for the failure. Lin repeatedly went to the net, succeeding some times and being repelled by Carson other times. Therefore, he gradually reduced his net play. His chop shots with slicing did earn him many points.</p>
<p>Major Referee Error</p>
<p>After Lin lost the first game 3-6, Lin suddenly rallied in the second game, leading 3-0, with the possibility of reversing the decline. In the next game, Carson served, and Lin scored two consecutive points. When Lin went forward to block the net, Carson's brilliant sideline ball forced Lin to retreat in frustration. Lin connected to the net twice, and Carson won a game. Lin's serve failed, making it 3-2. Carson served, and Lin took the lead with a score of 15-40. Carson fought back bravely, creating a tie (3-3). Lin won another point. In the next point, the two players hit the ball in the air in front of the net, and Lin finally won. This game should have been won by Lin, but the referee judged that Carson had won and shouted "Tie". As a result, Carson won this game, and 4-2 became 3-2. It can be seen how important the outcome of the next game for Lin's serve was. The audience was in an uproar, but there was nothing they could do. Carson was embarrassed, so he gave away four consecutive points in the next game, and Lin took the lead again with 4-3. In the next game, Lin served, and Carson was able to save Lin's three consecutive smash shots, so he won this game. The second game became 4-6.</p>
<p>The Situation in the First and Third Games</p>
<p>At the start of the competition, Carson served first, and Lin won with a slip, drawing applause. Unexpectedly, in the next four games, Carson achieved it in one go, winning them in a row, making it 1-4. Lin went to the net three times, winning only once. Lin won the sixth game, making it 2-4. However, Carson also won when he served. In the next two games, each player won one. Carson won the first game 6-3. Lin lost the second game after leading, and his spirit and situation were greatly affected. The situation in the third game became irredeemable, 2-1, 5-1, and then winning the eighth game, ending with 6-2.</p>
<p>Today's Match Schedule</p>
<p>Starting at 2:30 PM today, Korasha will play Forbes in another advanced singles semi-final. Next will be the Robber Cup final between England and America, Carson and Skia versus Devo and Ponawicki. Finally, Lin and Carson will play a special singles exhibition match with a best-of-three format. Today's match is to commemorate Qiu Feihai. The ticket income, excluding necessary expenses, will be donated to Qiu's family.</p>

<p>Our World Games Team Returns Home on the Itenden Ship; Japanese Athletes Travel Together</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Genoa, Italy, 4th - The Chinese delegation of athletes participating in the Berlin Olympics, a group of 130 people, recently boarded the mail ship Conte Rosso here and set off for home. Forty-nine Japanese athletes, except for a portion who are still competing in various European countries, also boarded this ship to return home.</p>
<p>Professor Taka Iwa Talks About Marathon: It Already Existed in the Yuan Dynasty; See Tao Zongyi's "輟耕録"</p>
<p>Special Correspondence, September 5th - Marathon races have existed in Mongolia since ancient times. Professor Taka Iwa, Doctor of Literature at the Japanese University of Arts and Sciences, has published interesting remarks on this matter:</p>
<p>"Although I am a scholar of Oriental history, I often read Chinese books. I occasionally read '輟耕錄' written by Tao Zongyi (号南村) , a Chinese scholar during the transition between the Yuan and Ming dynasties (the Yoshino period in Japan, about 560 years ago). It records miscellaneous events of the Yuan Dynasty. There is a passage in the first volume that records the long-distance running of the Mongols, which is similar to the current marathon. I will introduce it below, which is also quite interesting:</p>
<p>"貴由赤者快行也、每歲一試之、名曰放走、以脚力便捷者、膺上賞、故監督之官、齊其名數、而的之以繩、使無後先參差之爭、然後去繩放行、在大都則自河西務起程、若上都則自泥河兒起程、越二三時而一百八十里、直抵御前、俯伏呼萬歲、先至者、賜銀一餅、餘者賜段匹有差" According to the text, "貴由赤" means fast walking in Mongolian, which is a transliteration. First, the government investigates the names and numbers of the athletes, stands them at the starting point, ties them together with a rope, arranges them in a row, and then fires a cannon to start the race simultaneously. When held in Dadu (now Beijing), it starts from Hexiwu (more than 60 miles southeast of Beijing). When held in Shangdu (Kaiping—the emperor's summer resort, now Duolunnuoer in Chahar Province, Inner Mongolia), it starts from Nihe'er (along the Shandian River), running the entire route of 180 li in three hours (now six hours), arriving in front of the emperor, bowing and shouting "Long live the Emperor!". The first to arrive is awarded a silver cake (weighing ten taels), and the rest are given different rewards. Although the qualifications and number of athletes are not clearly stated, it seems that thirty to forty guards were selected at that time. Their speed is slower than today's world athletes, who run 26 miles in two hours, with two and a half times the distance and three and a half times the time. However, this method of encouraging sports was probably created independently by the martial Mongolian court and not learned from others. The Mongols are used to trekking through mountains and rivers and consider it an honor to be selected, preparing to participate every year. However, it is unknown when this race started. It seems that it already existed when Kublai Khan, Emperor Shizu of Yuan, established Dadu and Shangdu. Since Genghis Khan, the Mongols have encouraged hunting as military training for their subordinates. When going on expeditions, there were female soldiers on horseback to repair weapons or manage military stations, which is well known. However, few people noticed that they encouraged sports to the extent of the above-mentioned race. Therefore, I wrote this short article to show that the race was actually created in East Asia."</p>

<p>Xinghua defeated Yixin 4-2</p>
<p>Zhonghua defeated Shinan 3-1</p>
<p>The level of skill and the size of the scores varied in yesterday's matches, but in terms of spirit, the Zhongfa Yong and Jingguang teams were the best. Both teams used legitimate methods to compete, with no violent actions or cunning behavior. Zhongfa's pure attitude of winning without arrogance and Jingguang's spirit of not being discouraged by defeat are even more praiseworthy. In the Yousheng vs. Jianhua match, both teams were eager to win and acted excessively, resulting in one player being sent off from each team, which left a flaw in the match. It is hoped that they will correct this in the future.</p>

<p>Chinese Students in the UK Establish the Metallurgical Engineering Society</p>
<p>Studying Various Issues in Metallurgical Engineering, Liu Gang and Tao Enrui are Elected as Executive Directors. Metallurgical Engineering is Extremely Important to National Defense and the Nation. According to Europe, America, Japan, and other major powers, the reason why they have amazing military equipment and the average standard of living is high is mainly due to the prosperity of science and the development of heavy industry. Among heavy industries, the metallurgical industry is the most fundamental. Without the metallurgical industry, even if there are underground resources, they cannot be used to manufacture machinery. Construction in our country has gradually improved over the years, but the basic industries of heavy industry have not yet developed. Over the past five years, more than 500 million yuan worth of steel and various metal materials have been imported. As for mining, although it is struggling hard under the recession, the only sales channel is foreign countries, especially Japan. Anyone with scientific knowledge and patriotic conscience cannot but feel heartbroken. Recently, Chinese students studying metallurgical engineering in the UK have been subjected to various stimuli. They feel the wide scope, the vastness of equipment, and the difficulty of management and application of metallurgical engineering. The individual's time, energy, and economy are limited, and they believe that revitalizing the metallurgical industry is essential for the rejuvenation of our nation. Therefore, in addition to fulfilling their student duties by studying hard, active liaison is essential. According to the Huanyu Chinese Students' Association, students studying metallurgy in the UK gathered in London on August 2nd to organize the Yingzhi Metallurgical Engineering Society. The planned work is divided into three major categories: (1) Holding round-robin communication to discuss various issues in metallurgical engineering; (2) Seeking full opportunities for members to visit factories for internships and investigating the existing metallurgical facilities and the progress of promotion in China; (3) Publishing documents and introducing members' professions. This work has been distributed, and Liu Gang and Tao Enrui have been elected as executive directors of the association to start association affairs. The names of the members are recorded below: Wang Zhi (Steel), Dai Lizhi (Magnetic Steel), Xu Daosheng (Steel), Yang Zhenyong (Tin), Zhang Mingding (Non-ferrous Metallurgy), Tao Enrui (Light Metals), Liu Gang (Steel), Shao Xianghua (Iron and Non-ferrous Metallurgy), Qiu Yuchi (Metallurgy).</p>

It is also reported that the last batch, Ding Xianyou, Feng Zengshou, and a group of ten people, have scheduled to travel to the United States on the US mail President Coolidge on the 8th.</p>
<p>Arrangement of the City Library</p>
<p>The city library opened on a trial basis on September 1st. The reporter visited it yesterday and recorded the arrangement of the library as follows: The reporter obtained a reading pass at the entrance certificate collection office and entered the main gate for a tour. The left wing of the passage is the office of each department, and the right wing is the children's library. The central hall is the newspaper reading area. Chinese and foreign newspapers are arranged in eight shelves, a total of sixty-eight types. The entire central area upstairs is the catalog room. The catalog cards are stored in steel cabinets, which are novel in form and easy to flip through. They can be called a modern setup. Behind it is the library. The books are retrieved at the front counter of the library. Readers fill in the book retrieval certificate and hand it to the librarian, who retrieves it from the library for reading. When asked, the librarian said that the current collection of Chinese and foreign books, purchased from home and abroad, has reached more than 58,000 volumes. They are currently engaged in registration and cataloging for public viewing. The books donated by various circles also number no less than 15,000 volumes. The left wing is the book reading room. The Sibu Beiyao and Wanyou Wenku and reference books are stored in fifteen wooden shelves. In order to facilitate reading, the library has specially arranged 300 types of newly arrived Chinese and foreign books that have not been cataloged on a long table and compiled a concise catalog, with different colored label numbers attached for easy reference. It is changed once a week. The right wing is the magazine reading room, which contains 586 types of Chinese and foreign magazines, which are stored in seventeen wooden shelves. Each room can accommodate about 150 people. They are seated according to numbers. All the books on the shelves can be taken out for reading at will. After reading, hand it to the librarian for sorting and putting it back in its original place. Next to the magazine reading room is the Wu Liande Dr. Collection Room, which displays many rare Chinese and foreign books. The light in each room is harmonious, the air is circulating, and the seats are neat and tidy. It is truly a beautiful place to read in the hustle and bustle of Shanghai. The order in the library is solemn. If readers have any questions, the library staff will explain them without being tiresome. It is especially rare. For transportation, there are Chinese-owned Route 5 buses. It is a pity that the stop is far from the library. When the weather changes suddenly, it is a little difficult to wait for the bus. It is hoped that the authorities will improve this.</p>

<p>Local Supplement of Shen Bao, Amateur Weekly Journal on Books: Review of "On the Annihilation of Love" by Lu Fu (Edited by Lu Jianbo, Published by Tai Dong Book Company)</p>
<p>Aside from the necessities of life, love is undoubtedly the most important issue for young people. The mere mention of "love" or "romance" tends to evoke excitement and envy. Even amidst a life of hardship and unpleasant experiences, falling in love and immersing oneself in the sea of romance can invigorate you, allowing you to appreciate the joy of life and fueling your drive and ambition. Conversely, heartbreak can lead to disillusionment, dejection, even feelings of world-weariness, negativity, and suicidal thoughts. Some, lost in the throes of love, become oblivious to everything else, indulging in dissipation and romance to the point of moral decay. In short, love is arguably the most crucial issue for people after basic sustenance.</p>
<p>Some elevate love to a sacred status, believing it to be governed by a god of love, purely a form of spiritual entertainment, the embodiment of emotions, noble and pure, devoid of obscene physical acts or sexual behavior. They also believe that love transcends all social relationships, unconstrained by material conditions, unaffected by life's problems. It is a purely spiritual, beautified behavior that surpasses the physical, transcends time, and defies class distinctions. This is the theory of love supremacy. Others argue that love is simply a matter of sex, sexual behavior, and the physical relationship between men and women. Aside from this physical sexual relationship, there is no such thing as love. Similarly, it is unrelated to any social environment or material conditions other than the physical. As long as there are two sexes and they come into contact, sexual behavior will occur. There is no such thing as "love" or "emotion" involved. This is the theory of the annihilation of love.</p>
<p>The "On the Annihilation of Love" that we are about to critique belongs to the latter school of thought.</p>
<p>This book is a collection of essays on the issue of love by Lu Jianbo, Xiang Peiliang, Gao Changhong, and Qian Di. They share a common opinion, namely, advocating for the annihilation of love.</p>
<p>Let's see what they have to say. They argue: "The sexual union of two sexes is only sexual intercourse. And sexual intercourse is purely carnal, with no such thing as love." "Sexual intercourse is a physiological matter, with no psychological element (and the so-called psychology is merely a manifestation of the stimulation and reaction of the nervous system)." "The existence of sexual desire does not carry the meaning of the word love. We should further acknowledge that the sexual intercourse between two sexes based on sexual desire is all there is; there is no such thing as love."</p>
<p>Naturally, those who espouse the theory of love supremacy believe that love can transcend all material things, surpassing the physical, and that love is unrelated to sexual behavior. This is pure metaphysics and subjectivism, because to seek that transcendent, spiritual, ideal, pure love apart from the material body is to forever fail to attain the joy of love. It can also be said that they have not yet reached the stage of successful love. But conversely, if one denies all love and reduces the relationship between men and women entirely to a kind of sexual relationship, as the proponents of the annihilation of love do, their error is precisely the opposite of that of the love supremacists. In our view, although the primary motive for love arises from the human instinct for reproduction and the instinct of the species, human beings are not common animals. They have a life that is more evolved and complex than that of ordinary animals, so their sexual union is not satisfied solely by carnal desire. Not only is the harmony of inspiration and temperament very important, but also general morality, knowledge, and thought are sufficient to make love intense or indifferent. Therefore, the claims of the proponents of the annihilation of love are mechanical materialism.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the proponents of the annihilation of love say: "If we fundamentally break the anthropocentric idea that humans are the spirit of all things, and recognize that our understanding of things is not much smarter than that of our ancestors, then we can understand that the modern sexual life of us humans is still running in the same circle as our ancestors." Based on the above argument, since we are almost the same as our ancestors, primitive humans, and our ancestors are almost the same as apes and animals, then our sexual life should still be animalistic now. No wonder the author of this book advocates for interbreeding between primitive humans and animals in an article on miscegenation; they are purely advocates of sexual libertarianism! But they only know that humans are the product of nature, but they do not know that humans are also the product of society. They only understand the animal nature of human beings, but they do not understand the human nature of human beings. They simply treat animals and humans as the same. We know that the way of life of human beings is completely restricted by the social and economic material conditions. The form of marriage and sexual relations are also the same. In the era of tribal society, there were promiscuous sexual relations; in the era of feudal society, there was polygamy; and in capitalist society, there is monogamy, because the economic conditions of each era are different, so the marriage forms of each era are also different. If you want to destroy history and pull the sexual relationship of humans in the present and the future back to the same as in the primitive era, that is all a fantasy. Naturally, in the future society, its sexual relationship must be different from the present, but it will never be as the proponents of the annihilation of love say, that it must "return to nature" and return to the absolutely free promiscuous sexual relations of primitive humans. It must be known that the development of history is evolutionary, not a complete repetition and cycle, and is even the primitive sexual relationship really absolutely free and not affected by the social and economic conditions of the time?</p>
<p>As the proponents of love theory say, present love is monetary love, and love can be exchanged for money, and the issue of sex is therefore quite suppressed, and its natural development is not allowed. But the fact that love has become a commodity and is suppressed is precisely because of the defects in the social system, which constrains the development of love, which is not due to the fault of love itself, and even less to prove the annihilation of love, or that there is no such thing as love at all. We see that those like-minded couples, no matter how painful life is or how bad the environment is, some still fight together, even some commit suicide together, dying for love. It is certainly wrong to put love in the first place and abandon everything and sacrifice everything to offer it up; but love, romance, always exists, and should be treasured and respected, certainly not as the proponents of the annihilation of love say. Because love is purely the love that develops between two sexes in the long-term mutual selection and mutual admiration, and it is not purely a sexual relationship.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the proponents of the annihilation of love reverse cause and effect by saying: "Sexual liberation is the first and foremost task of human liberation, otherwise, people are still slaves." Therefore, the transformation of sexual relations is the first and foremost task of social transformation. Naturally, sexual liberation is also an important issue in social transformation, but if we were to do as the proponents of the annihilation of love argue, break the current marriage system of buying and selling, and adopt an absolutely free promiscuous marriage system, would the society be fundamentally transformed? If the entire social system is not transformed, and the economic relations are not transformed, is everything solved by sexual liberation? It is not known that the thorough solution to the women's question must be based on the solution of the social question as a prerequisite.</p>
<p>The proponents of the annihilation of love "obliterate the marriage system and free love, and advocate for free sexual intercourse," that is, promiscuity. This is the final conclusion of their theory. The book On the Annihilation of Love is entirely a statement of this theory. Tracing its origins, this is also a reflection of the current society. Because the general petty bourgeoisie are economically unstable, so they cannot be satisfied in sexual relations, but sometimes they can freely and irregularly seek some purely physical comfort. They cannot see the inevitable laws of social development, nor can they see the image of future society. They only hate the inequality and ugliness of the current society, so they are passive, and sometimes excited, inevitably wanting to seek a satisfying free world in the dissatisfied society of reality, and also fantasize about the ancient past, believing that it was absolutely free, so they advocate returning to nature, and approve of "free sexual intercourse," "promiscuity." In short, the theoretical basis of the annihilation of love is caused by the disillusioned, alienated, and unstable thinking of the petty bourgeoisie of the current society. The book On the Annihilation of Love is a poisonous book, and it is not afraid of what criticism it gives to the love of the modern large bourgeoisie.</p>

<h3>Hebei Province's New Budget for This Year Seeks Austerity to Achieve Balanced Budget, Reduction of Education Funds Arouses Opposition from the Education Sector</h3>
<p>Baoding Correspondence: In recent years, Hebei Province has faced special circumstances and numerous local incidents. Furthermore, the twenty-two counties of eastern Hebei broke away last year, forming a special zone, which led to a sharp decrease in provincial revenue, causing significant losses. The financial situation is extremely strained. Moreover, Hebei Province bears heavy military and administrative expenses. Although income has decreased, expenditure remains the same. Every financial authority in the past has felt the difficulties. Since Chairman Song Zheyuan took office, he specially appointed Jia Yuzhang, the former supervisor of Zhangjiakou Customs, as the Director of Finance. Jia had previously served as the head of the military supply department under Feng Yuxiang and was a capable financial manager in the Northwest Army. However, he felt quite hesitant about Hebei Province's accumulated financial deficits. After a thorough and comprehensive investigation, it was estimated that the provincial treasury had an annual deficit of more than eight million yuan. Several plans were made to increase revenue and reduce expenditure, but the remedial measures seemed impossible to achieve. Moreover, since the budget for the 24th year was already in effect when Chairman Song took office, it was not convenient to change it. Before the start of the new budget for the 25th year, Chairman Song specially instructed the Finance Department to find ways to balance revenue and expenditure, and the deficit must be reduced. After receiving the order, the Finance Department invited the heads of various provincial departments to discuss reduction methods. All parties felt that the province had already made many reductions, and the budgets of various departments were already at the minimum. Further reductions would affect the progress of government affairs. Therefore, after several discussions, no results were achieved. However, since the Finance Department had received Chairman Song's instructions, it had to strive for reductions. At this time, Song personally instructed Jia Yuzhang, the Director of Finance, to ensure that the budget for the 25th year was balanced. As a result, Jia conveyed Chairman Song's intention of balancing the budget to all parties and formulated several reduction principles, which were handed over to the Finance Department for implementation. The contents were: (1) Administrative expenses were reduced to 80% of the original amount for disbursement; (2) Redundant institutions were abolished; (3) Institutions with similar functions were merged; (4) All senior provincial officials would hold concurrent positions without additional pay. The Finance Department then prepared a new budget based on the above four principles and submitted it. After Lai reviewed it, the gap between revenue and expenditure was still significant. Song believed that since the budget was not balanced, further reductions were needed. Song personally approved the reduction of several items and reduced the provincial education funds to 85% of the original amount for disbursement. Schools that were poorly managed and non-essential institutions under the jurisdiction of the Education Department were abolished. After Song approved it, it was handed over to the Finance Department for implementation and ordered to take effect from August. Although the new budget was established under Song's instructions, the part about education funds caused unanimous opposition from the entire provincial education sector. They successively petitioned Song to consider the province's education and approve the maintenance of the original plan. Presidents of universities and colleges in Pingjin and Baoding and those directly under the province organized a joint meeting and visited Song to state the reasons why education funds could not be reduced. However, the Standing Committee's will was firm, and the universities and colleges' efforts to fight for it yielded no results. Recently, the Education Department allocated the July funds to the universities and colleges according to the original amount, and all parties thought that the original plan might be maintained in the future. Unexpectedly, the Provincial Standing Committee formally declared that the province's education funds would be implemented according to the new budget from August. Those universities and colleges with actual achievements in management may be restored in the future, while those with average achievements must be reduced. Currently, the entire provincial education sector has not expressed acceptance of the authorities' intention to reduce education funds. In addition to continuing to send representatives to various parties for negotiations, they are also seeking support from various related parties. Therefore, the situation is still at a stalemate.

<h3>Wuxi: Opening a Coffin for a Post-Mortem Examination of Boatmen</h3>
<p>Yao Hengfu from Tongli Town, Wujiang, made a living selling yellow grass. A month ago, he and his nephew Yao Shengbao traveled by boat to the Nanfangquan area of the third district of this county to purchase yellow grass. At the end of the month, after completing the purchase, on the morning of the first day of this month, the boat passed under the Beiwangting Bridge and was violently rammed by Huang Guanzhen's empty rice boat and Ge Rongsheng's tea boat. Yao Hengfu lost his balance and fell into the river, resulting in his drowning. Shengbao prepared a coffin for the burial. The other day, Wu Zhaorong, the captain of the first squad of the fifth brigade of the second district of the Water Police stationed in Beiwangting, believed that the case involved human life and could not be ignored. Therefore, he ordered the squad member Pan Degen to come to the city the other day to report to the local court, requesting a post-mortem examination. After receiving the report, the Procuratorate immediately instructed Prosecutor Shen to go with Shen, the coroner, and bailiffs to open the coffin for a post-mortem examination. The examination revealed that the deceased Yao Hengfu's skin color had changed, his face was as black as lacquer, his muscles had rotted, and there were no injuries. It was confirmed that he had died after falling into the river. After the examination, he ordered the family to re-coffin the body.</p>
<h3>A Thief Re-Imprisoned for Rape</h3>
<p>Wei Afu, a villager from Zhulong Bridge, Baitu Township, Second District, was of bad character. In the seventeenth year of the Republic [1928], he participated in the robbery of a Suzhou money boat, was arrested and imprisoned. After being sentenced to twelve years in prison by the Wuxian Local Court, he was pardoned for four years under a general amnesty. He had just been released from prison and returned to his hometown in April last year. Unexpectedly, Afu still did not repent. The other day, at about 6 p.m., he saw Li Xutang's daughter A'mei (17 years old), a neighbor, picking mulberry leaves in the mulberry fields along the Tang River nearby. Afu, driven by lust, stepped forward to tease A'mei and attempted to rape her. A'mei shouted for help, and Shan Asi, a fisherman from a nearby boat, heard the cries and immediately reported to the Second Company, First Battalion, Second Regiment of the Road Protection Constabulary stationed in Zhoujing Lane, who apprehended Afu and handed him over to the Public Security Bureau. Yesterday (the 5th), he was transferred to the court for interrogation. It is reported that the robbery cases of Hua Gensheng, Zhu Longqiao, Zhou Wenbing, etc., in Xinqiao Township, and the knife injury case of the abbot monk in Longzhu Nunnery are all related to the offender.</p>

<h3>Wang Bonian Invented a Chinese Telegraph Machine That Eliminates the Need to Translate into Telegraphic Codes When Sending Telegrams; It Has Been Examined by the Ministry of Communications and Found to be Suitable; A Public Test Will Be Held at the Bank Association the Day After Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Our country's telegraph business began in the seventh year of Guangxu [1881]. At that time, due to the complex structure of Chinese characters and the large number of characters, the Danish Great Northern Telegraph Company was entrusted to develop a method to compile Chinese characters into telegraphic codes for transmission. On the receiving side, the codes were translated into text and then delivered. The repeated translation was time-consuming and prone to errors. However, more than fifty years have passed, and no improvement measures have been taken. During the tenth year of the Republic [1921], Zeng Yijin, a member of the State Council, invented a method of using character decomposition to directly transmit Chinese telegrams. However, after review by the Ministry of Communications, it was deemed that the transmission procedure was too slow, with more disadvantages than advantages, and it was not adopted. In the twenty-second year [1933], Cen Shilong published an article on the design of Chinese electrical machinery, but it was never realized. Now, Mr. Wang Bonian, a water line engineer at the Ministry of Communications, has spent years of research and sacrificed a large amount of money to create three types of "Chinese Character Electrical Telegraph Machines," two transmitters and one receiver. The machine is easy to operate. The machine is equipped with a Chinese character dial with 10,000 Chinese characters printed on the dial. The dial has a movable pointer. When sending a message, move the pointer to any character and press the button. The character symbol will be sent to the other party. The other party receives the symbol and uses a Chinese typewriter to type out the Chinese character. This way, there is no need to translate when sending and receiving telegrams, and the transmission is fast and the characters are accurate. It is a great contribution and improvement to our country's telegraph business. Mr. Wang and his assistant Chen Songsheng took the machine to Beijing at the end of July and held a test in the technical office of the Ministry of Communications. After the Ministry of Communications sent personnel to review the results, it was deemed to be in line with the principle and could be adopted. It is reported that Engineer Wang has now brought the machine to Shanghai to conduct an actual test at the Telegraph Bureau on Simalu Road. General criticism believes that the machine can eliminate the translation process and is easy to use. It is reported that Mr. Wang will borrow the Bank Association of this port at 5 p.m. on the 7th of this month to conduct a public test.</p>
