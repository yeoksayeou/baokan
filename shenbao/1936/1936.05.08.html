<h3>意阿戰爭吿一段落</h3>
<p>— 賓</p>
<p>經過七個月艱苦勇敢的掙扎遭受無數次達姆達姆彈和毒瓦斯的蹂躪在五十萬羅馬大軍的進逼之下阿比西尼亞終於失敗了「萬王之王」悄悄地受了英艦的保護逃到巴力斯坦巴陀格利奧的軍隊驕笑着大踏步的開入阿京在羅馬是滿城歡欣鼓舞在阿迭斯阿巴巴只是一片凄凉和混亂半載來東菲一個弱小民族的抗戰就這樣的告了個段落</p>
<p>阿比西尼亞是失敗了然而它的失敗是光榮的當戰事開始時一般不抵抗主義者頗以爲阿之抗意無異以卵敵石都說十天之內意軍就可攻陷阿京了墨沙里尼也曾誇說到阿迭斯阿巴巴過聖誕節去然而事實怎樣呢是的阿比西尼亞的武器遠不如意大利意大利有的是二十世紀最新式的坦克車阿比西尼亞兵士握着的郤是十八世紀的來福槍意軍有的是各式各樣新奇的毒瓦斯阿比西尼亞郤連防毒面具都付闕如然而阿軍的士氣是浩盛熱烈的大砲不如人飛機不如人的阿比西尼亞就賴這僅有的英勇的士氣竟支持了七個月之久如果不因戰略上的錯誤也許還可延持下去進而威脅意大利的生存（意大利爲戰事支出已達六百五十萬萬里拉國庫已一貧如洗再不能長久支撑下去了）這一點在我們是不能忽略的</p>
<p>我們從阿比西尼亞的失敗還可獲得兩重敎訓第一見得國聯是根本不可憑藉的自從一九三一年「九一八」事變之後國聯盟的早已顯得無用這番是經了又一次的試驗了當去年意阿戰爭爆發之初國聯就發動了對意的制裁但終因各國利害的關係不肯切實執行如法國爲要拉攏意國以對德就一向不願過度制意英國以利益所關態度雖比較强硬但亦只以紙上活躍爲止在各帝國主義矛盾關係牽掣之下國聯只是它們維護利益的幌子阿比西尼亞失敗的事實更證明了這一點第二見得戰略是不可不講求的就阿比西尼亞的軍備情形和地理環境言它應該以聲東擊西的方法去分散意軍的精銳可是已往它郤大都採取了集團作戰的方法這實在是它戰略上的失算因爲它的正規軍不過五十萬而意軍也就有五六十萬以它軍器的窳劣用大軍作正面抵抗自然易受重創倘使它能不僅以正規軍應戰而把全國數百萬的壯丁組織無數的遊擊隊分散各處制敵的腹背也許還可以取勝的但組織民衆自然又有着困難了因爲一個封建的君主平日和民衆難免隔膜縱有抗敵之决心傳統的條件郤限制了他組織羣衆的力量從這看來可知一國的領導者實在非常重要而上下團結也更顯其有意義了</p>

<h3>日議會開會第二日　質問戰白熱化</h3>
<p>財政政策衆矢之的</p>
<p>（東京）衆院本會議、本日午后一時十分開會、劈頭前田幸作（無所屬）關於議事進行、要求發言、富田議長拒之、仍繼續對施政演說之質問、請民政黨之勝正憲登壇、關於財政經濟問題質問政府、</p>
<p>勝正憲問　充實國防設施產業、須年幾何　須增大國費若干、將來歲出之觀察旣定、可以謀歲入之增收而安定財政乎、且豫定以幾年計畫行之乎、增稅計畫之範圍程度如何、低利政策不阻止貿易之發展乎、</p>
<p>馬塲藏相答　昭和十二年度以降之國防費增大額、無具體的判明、將來之歲出入亦不能明瞭言之、增稅問題亦不能言明、</p>
<p>其所答流於抽象論、於是民政黨議員席囂然不寗、謂有如此之藏相乎、卽井上元藏相亦曾陳述政策、</p>
<p>勝正憲氏再登壇、對藏相之答辯、表示遺憾之意、中止質問、</p>
<p>於是政友之堀切善兵衛登壇、首責政府之優柔不斷、謂廣田內閣爲表明庶政一新之政府、頃觀豫算案不過完全蹈襲前內閣而已、雖辯明因其間無時日之餘裕、然組閣以來已五十日、不知所爲何事、次謂欲確立今后之財政計畫、不可不看透歲出歲出之重要部門、爲國防費不可由軍部單獨决定、必置其基礎於六千萬國民之經濟力、若藏相追隨軍部、惟其言是聽、舉行必至之增稅、國民勢必不堪負担、國家之背後有六千萬之納稅國民、此不可忘記也、最後論產業與財政之關係而降壇、</p>
<p>此時田淵豐吉要求發言、議長不許、而田淵氏仍連呼要求發言不已、議長乃命其退塲、</p>
<p>民政黨之齋藤隆大登壇質問政治機構之改革、繼謂現內閣有無確保東亞和平之確信、更詢軍人干政、涉及二二六事件、謂政府壓迫言論、貴軍部之姑息手段、廣田首相答、政治目的者實現憲政政治、若有妨碍則改革之、此爲余之改革政治機構之根本觀念、繼謂東亞之和平狀態、目下並非理想、現將努力確保、寺內陸相亦謂於今日之非常時之際、將盡最善之努力、竭誠奉公、</p>
<p>後由笠井重治（無所屬）質問菲島之排日問題、</p>
<p>有田外相答、謂菲島之奎松大總統、如該問題含有重要性、担任好意的解决、外務省亦採萬全之策保護權益云云、</p>
<p>各答辯統於下午六時六分散會、</p>
<p>三上氏、質問關於國體明徵問題、新井白石先生曾攻擊「華泰」之文字、惟使國民使用「中華民國」四字、由保持日木獨立之體面與國體明徵、似覺不美云云、質詢外相之所信、</p>
<p>有田外相、對於國體明徵之旨趣抱同感、惟「中華民國」四字、爲中國歷史的劣等對待四隣之人民者、故並不特別對日本所使用、繼由平生文相潮內相等答辯後、於下午四時三十五分散會、明日上午十時繼續進行質問戰、（七日電通電）</p>
<h3>質問二·二六事件</h3>
<p>寺內僅作簡單答辯</p>
<p>（東京）衆議院六日開秘密會議、討論二二六事件、先由寺內陸相詳細報吿陸軍當局搜查事件狀况。進行裁判狀態，及戒嚴令施行前途等、其次卽開始質問、最初由山道襄一發言、關於軍部對於日本對美對華兩問題之動向、及敎育問題開陳詳細意見後質問事件黑幕關係·資金問題·及事件直後軍部所操手段等各事項、寺內陸相對此答辯、先述軍隊敎育現狀、關於對外問題則謂與軍一致對付於此、其次北聆吉起立質問思想問題肅軍問題後、追問五一五事件與二二六事件之關係、寺內陸相簡明的回答各事項、靑木精一乃發言、謂陸相前說在秘密會議詳細說明事件內容、然據現在說明尙未觸及之內容、陸相雖謂此爲最大限度之答辯、然事件發生後巳經過相當時日、料當局必已知悉事件內容、請爲更詳細之答辯、今次事件之重大性、空前未有、國民亦頗關心此事件、北氏於是質問戒嚴令前途·調查事件內容·及黑幕關係、寺內陸相對此答辯後、謂戒嚴令解除時期未能言明、其次河上丈太郎問、　事件目的、　赤化份子活動情形、　陸軍對肅軍之决意等、風見章問、　參加事件部隊之態度、　事件直後警備狀態、　資金關係、　背後關係、　相澤暗殺永田事件之裁判進行狀態、　當局對於事件之責任、　議員中有無與事件有關係者、陸相對以上各質問、致簡單解答、並謂資金關係現正調查中、陸軍未能豫想二二六事件發生、誠爲遺憾、現已覺悟、澈底實行肅軍、以免將來再發如此不祥事件、至此卽宣吿散會、（七日同盟電）</p>

<h3>法衆院改選後　社會黨將組閣</h3>
<p>共產黨允予贊助</p>
<p>（巴黎）新衆議院召集之後、正統派社會黨黨魁、卽將出而組閣、政界人士對於閣員人選、紛紛加以推測、間或失之離奇、事業報與巴黎廻聲報、頃將宣傳最盛之名單予以揭載、據稱、內閣總理萊翁勃崙是否兼任外長、尙未可知、設若不允兼任、則外長一席、當以現任不管部閣員彭古（共和社會聯合黨黨魁）担任之、急進社會黨黨魁前總理達拉第、當任國務恊理兼司法部長、或任陸軍部長、社會黨金融問題專家奧利沃爾、勢當接任財政部長、該黨衆議員（黑爾市長）薩朗葛羅當任爲內務部長、至海空兩部長大的當以急進社會黨黨員任之、其中航空部長一席、仍由谷脫任之、（達拉第內閣航空部長）海軍部長則由現任總理薩勞任之云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）法國正統派社會黨黨魁萊翁勃崙、卽將出任內閣總理、頃向工黨機關報每日民聲報發表談話稱、社會黨秉政之後、務當努力促成縮减軍備公約、「法國現擬以全力擁護集體安全一項原則、英國若在此際拋棄此種偉大計畫、世界慘劇恐無出其右者、法國對於國聯會所主持之集體行動、務必加以贊助、英國自可完全信任之」云云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）共產黨秘書長多萊士、頃向報界發表談話、對於該黨內政外交政綱、有所揭發、其言曰、「社會黨秉政之後、吾黨必以最忠實之態度予以贊助、但不擬加入內閣、吾黨爲勞工階級之政黨、而欲爲勞工階級解除資本家之覊軛、在解除目的尙未達到之前、吾黨當出全力以擁護民治主義、俾和平自由得以維持於不墜也、」</p>
<p>述及外交政策、多萊士主張諦結類似法俄互助公約之互助公約多種、以實現集體安全政策、其結論謂、「人民陣綫所屬各黨、將在全國各處組織執行委員會、從事統一工作、藉以保持團結、此際法國人民、黨同伐異、成見甚深、吾黨當有以撼動之、彼右派參戰軍人所組織之火十字團、隸屬天主敎之勞動階級、吾黨均願向之伸手言歡、俾得共同奮鬥、庶幾我法國之前程、得躋偉大之域也、」（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>法國金融恐慌</h3>
<p>八千五百萬元黃金輸美</p>
<p>（倫敦）今日外匯市塲仍紛紛大批售出法佛郎、直至法蘭西銀行將利益由五厘增至六厘、商家爲之稍慰、投機家從事補進時始已、今日午後景象顯較安靜、英國平準基金雖仍在運用、但已不必吸收大批法佛郎矣、法財長宣布政府决不取特別計畫控制外匯、或禁止現金出口後、法銀行復提高利率、於是數大投機家遂以爲時不可失、宜補進而獲現利、故市况乃爲稍安也、（六日路透電）</p>
<p>（紐約）此間財政專家之意、美當局或將輔助法佛郎、蓋英美平準基金嘗合作故也、惟衆料在法國新內閣澄淸大局以前、佛郎前途終難穩定、聞昨日巴黎裝船運至紐約之黃金、共値美金二千四百六十五萬元、連前已達八千五百五十萬元、（六日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）法蘭西銀行今日將貼現率自五厘增至六厘、此係政府保護法郎及阻止法郎貶價之第一步措施、該行曾於三月二十八日將貼現率自三厘半增至五厘、（六日國民電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）美法兩國商約、昨日已在華盛頓簽字，定於本年六月十五日生效、明年七月一日滿期、其條文尙未公佈、僅知兩國交易最多之貨物、例如法國葡萄酒與花邊、美國菓類與汽車各項貨物、均當减低進口稅率、此外雙方並當享受最惠國待遇、按自美國互惠通商法前於一九三四年三月間頒佈以還、該國與歐洲各國所簽訂之商約、此乃最關重要者也、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>意國對阿比西尼亞　不立傀儡君主</h3>

<h3>英工黨在衆院創議　繼續制裁意大利</h3>
<p>痛快抨擊政府因循誤事　艾登聲明考慮全部問題</p>
<p>（倫敦）工黨今日在下院中抨擊　政府在意阿爭議中之政策，並主張繼續對意施行經濟與財政制裁、</p>
<p>今日辯論、首由工黨戴爾頓發起、謂國聯與整個集體安全主義之喪失信用、應由英政府負責、英政府且辜負選舉人之委託、政府一方面未能履行其國聯盟約、尤其是在盟約第十六條下之義務、一方面鼓勵阿國對意抵抗、而使阿人抱國聯必予以援助之信仰、但又聽令阿國自生自滅、從未予以任何援助、且不獨不予以援助、而反准許以意國所必不可少之油繼續供給意國、致助意國摧殘阿國政府、並從其所經營之英伊（伊朗卽波斯）油公司獲取售油之利益、戴氏又稱、此非失敗之阿國與戰勝之意國間問題、但爲整個國聯與已被判明爲侵略國間之問題、侵略國利用其極優勢之武器，破壞其莊嚴締結不用野蠻戰具之條約、今日已在極不平等之狀况下、獲取顯著之勝利、際此局勢、决無取消制裁、承認意國勝利之理由、夫制裁乃經國聯一致判决施諸意國者、故工黨主張經濟上與財政上制裁、應繼續行之云、</p>
<p>自由黨辛克萊發言、亦謂國聯與意國間之問題、迄未解决、阿國竟挫敗於侵略國之手、使人引爲大恥、一般輿論决不爲造成此恥之諸國政府恕、蓋負此責者、不僅爲英政府已也云、</p>
<h3>張伯倫稱：　繼續制裁實屬危險</h3>
<p>前外相奧斯丁張伯倫稱、人有抱一種觀念者、以爲英國苟不承認其所貢獻者須傾於一大國方面、則英國卽可在國聯中有所作爲、或可使國聯實現其效能、須知抱此觀念者、直處於愚人樂園耳、依渠意見、一大國旣已有意的决定侵略行動、則雖經濟制裁之威脅亦不能阻止之、因此理由、渠在意阿爭議之初期、曾計算代價、並準備與他國積極進行、雖至施用武力之程序、亦所不恤、但在今日、則事變情遷、此時而欲繼續制裁、直不獨危險、且亦爲無效之政策、吾人前希望以國聯之行爲保障戰爭規程之實行、今則已失敗矣、但人類之成功、由於失敗、吾人應作眞正之努力、使德國等復入國聯、至於國聯盟約是否需要修正、以便行政院或大會在一爭議中及早行動、或在慘局未發現前有所决定之問題、應予以考慮、渠以爲政府欲以此種種地方公約與保障奠定國聯之見解、實屬正當云、</p>

<p>外相艾登起立置答、首先報吿阿京英救護隊美萊醫生在街中被暴衆槍擊傷重殞命之消息、繼言阿京英使署印兵衛隊在事態嚴重時之工作、謂此衛隊保全外人生命甚夥、不獨保護避居英使署內之二十三國人民約二千人、且遣派支隊赴各處救人出險、凡有求助者、無不應之、比政府因印兵保護其使署、已向英政府致謝、統帶此衛隊之軍官、確能維持印軍固有的最高榮譽云、外相旋答復對於政府政策之抨擊、謂英國與其他國聯會員國所遭遇之時局、困難而使人失望、英國在此爭議中始終居於領導地位、英油銷數、在一九三五年已由百分之十三减至百分之四、縱使完全停銷、究與此爭議之結果有何區別、日內瓦諸國政府中之公然主張油禁老、僅爲英國、英國深知制裁弱點在不能立卽實施有效、其唯一立卽有效之制裁、爲不許意國利用蘇彝士運河耳、第此舉勢必涉及軍事行動、終必釀成戰局、反對黨明雖揚言欲以騎步砲兵維護國聯、實則彼等不過欲以威嚇侮辱與空談爲國聯後援耳、須知英國不能以紙船封閉運河、英國苟未主張軍事制裁、則其故由於彼等怵於戰禍、及其最後結果耳、以法律言、運河苟無國聯之行動、不能封閉、反對黨試觀許多政府對於制裁之態度、其亦確信國聯必能通過封閉運河之</p>
<h3>五月經騐　國聯必須决定前途</h3>
<p>議案乎、此固毫無希望也、以言將來國聯必須進行在一個新世界中國聯乃不可少的國際組織、此誠顯然、但加入國聯之各國政府與各個會員、旣負責任、必須審愼考慮由過去三個月經騐而得之結果而國聯必須整個的决定將來行動之途徑、此亦事之顯然者、英政府提議立卽從事於因此而發生的各種難題之考慮、故將與海外各自治領之政府開始商榷、吾人不得不承認國聯行動旣未能於戰爭未作前阻止戰爭之發作、亦未能於戰爭旣作後制止戰事之進行、國聯最多不過使戰爭較爲困難、且代價較高而已、是以世界與國聯現遇有可怖的問題、吾人能預料將來國聯可施行較前更爲嚴峻之行爲乎、會員國可担任較前更爲重大之危險乎、能使國聯行動有防止性多於報復性乎、凡此僅爲吾人所遇之數種問題、餘者姑不具論、故前途困難、决非細微、但政府將以實事求是之精神與建設性質之政治手腕以應付之云、外相對於星期一日國聯行政院會議時渠將採取之政策、不願置言、謂在此情形下、渠之請求下院予以信仰、不能視爲無理云、</p>
<p>外相繼言及致德政府關於和平條問事、謂渠希望駐德英大使明日可將此條問提交德政府云、外相又答覆勞合喬治之問話、謂政府深知其中有數點與他國政府有特殊關係、但英政府現將以自己責任將此條問提交德國、政府在此談判中之目的、仍與初談判時同、卽欲將危險時期變爲有機會時期耳、洛迦諾條約之被片面的取消，已撼動歐洲安全之機構、吾人今之工作、在重行建築之、英國前已有若干貢獻、現擬進行此工作、蓋覺未有較此更爲緊要者也、吾人對於現時所有之危險不應熟視無覩、世界各處現方大置軍備、以事實言、有數國似不顧其國家經濟中其他一切需要、而唯添置軍備是務、英國今所當行者、在　施行種種和平方法、以謀懸案之解决、　利用種種之機會、以增進國際之妥恊、　貫澈重置軍備之計劃、蓋重置軍備、現已成解决各困難之不可少的要素、因無論世界前途如何、或世界組織將來如何、英國自有其職責、苟無軍備爲其工具、則在此武裝世界中决不能有效的盡其職責也云、</p>
<p>漢德森（前軍縮大會主席漢德森之子）除贊助繼續制裁之建議外、主張召回駐意英大使、並將意國逐出國聯、</p>
<h3>邱吉爾謂：　吾人亦皆感覺奇恥</h3>
<p>邱吉爾發言、對於首相包爾溫痛加抨擊、謂包爾溫曾以意軍佔據阿京渠引爲奇恥爲言、吾人亦皆感覺奇恥、但致之者、誰乎、邱吉爾又因包爾溫未參加辯論、發言攻擊、謂握權之一人、現不出塲應付、又謂此次辯論、已使英國事件大受傷害、如繼續辯論、則必使人氣頹喪云、</p>
<p>外部次官克蘭本子爵代政府致答、謂政府有種種理由可以其在意阿爭議中之舉動自豪、吾人犧牲金錢、冒大危險、以維護吾人所信仰之主義、但因一種制度未能收效、致所得者爲失望、吾人必須淸理此地位、此種淸理、必須透澈以查明能否使國聯有效云、</p>

<h3>意國再三聲明　尊重英法權利</h3>
<p>英否認與意談判　法使見墨索里尼</p>
<p>（羅馬）今日據政界聲稱、列强在阿比西尼亞之現有權利、如英國對太那湖之利益、法國對吉波蒂鐵路之權利、意國均將謹愼尊重之、至於宣布以阿比西尼亞爲意大利之保護國、或將阿國併入意國版圖、今尙談不到此、墨索里尼所發阿比西尼亞爲意國所有之言論、含有伸縮性、可作以阿爲保護國解、亦可作兼併阿國解、而使門戶開啟、俾從事外交談話、聞墨氏之意、今已可集有理智之入舉行圓桌會會、依現實的基礎商定、一種解决、以保全地中海紅海與太那湖英國之利益、意國則决不放棄阿比西尼亞任何土地、此可以意大利日報所載蓋達之言論徵之、其言曰、墨索里尼之羅馬和平宣言、意卽爲完全併有阿比西尼亞也、（六日路透電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）外傳英法兩國、當聯合要求意國承認兩國在阿國境內之勢力範圍、負責方面頃否認此說、幷謂英法兩國之勢力範圍、業在一九〇六年英法意三國條約中、明文規定、無須再予確定云、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>對意製裁繼續與否成為國聯當前問題</h3>
<p>國聯行政院十一日開會　各國代表當有重要接洽</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國政界對於阿比西尼亞問題、頃主張採取「觀望政策」、以爲國聯會行政院本月十一日開會時、艾登外相自必前往出席、但當任其以大多數會員國之態度爲態度云、至以對意制裁而論、英國下議院原已傾向撤消之議、但自法國正統派社會黨黨魁萊翁勃倫、向每日民聲報記者發表談話、對於集體安全一項原則、加以擁護之後、英國反對派工黨下議院黨團領袖阿德里少校、卽定於本星期之杪、前往巴黎、俾與法國社會黨各領袖會商國際局勢、加之南菲洲聯邦當局、亦復主張賡續制裁、下議院反對派之聲勢、因而爲之一振、緩和空氣、已爲之銷沉不少矣、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）對于意阿爭端幷無直接關係各國、卽瑙威·丹麥·瑞典·芬蘭·荷蘭·西班牙各國代表、已定於五月九日、卽國聯會行政院開會之前二日、舉行預備會議、國聯會人士以爲各該國代表屆時似當要求撤消對意制裁、幷推舉西班牙、丹麥兩國代表、在行政院發言辯護、關於此層、英國政府雖不願有所發動、但他國若果提出此議、當可加以贊成、此在瑞士國人士、則謂制裁手段、設非用以防止戰爭或制止戰爭、卽屬毫無意義、自無賡續之必要、此外、幷傳某某國、尤其是法國代表、或當提議對於意阿爭端、暫緩决定辦法、英國或可贊成此議、俾俟法國新內閣組織成立、幷獲得新衆議院信任之後、再就此項問題、進行談判、幷成立妥恊云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）艾登外相今日向下院宣稱、阿比西尼亞自加入國聯以來、至今共交付會費美金一二六、一四四元、工黨議員戈克斯當卽提出質問稱、外相以爲阿比西尼亞所付之會費、已得其代價乎、艾登未致答覆、鮑爾溫首相亦向下院宣稱、英國不願單獨制止意國併吞阿比西尼亞、英國將來對於意阿兩國之政策、主張在國聯行政院星期一開會時、由關係各國共同考慮云、（六日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）此層、官方雖守緘默、但據一般人所知、英國政府仍當擁護集體安全政策、而國聯會行政院於本月十一日開會之際、凡所决定、英國均當予以遵守、關於取銷現行制裁辦法一層、英國雖當與多數會員國一致行動、而不擬首倡此議、但內閣衷心、未始不願加以取銷、此際問題所在、厥唯取銷制裁、應採何種程序、始可保持國聯會與英國之威望於不墜是也、聞艾登外相前往日內瓦之時、或將順道在巴黎稍作勾留、俾與法國佛蘭亭外長、商討意阿問題之新局勢云、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）頃據每日電聞報載稱、關於改組國聯會之議、英國政府當於本年九月間。國聯大會開會時、提付討論云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）頃據政界人士宣稱、國聯會行政院本月十一日在日內瓦開會時、意國當遣派代表前往出席、但阿比西尼亞問題解决方法、除由意國兼併而外、實無其他辦法、屆時國聯會若果討論及此、自當加以拒絕、意國業已經由外交途徑通吿各關係國、謂阿國政權、原已名存而實亡、際茲國皇與儲君相率出走之後、且已名實俱亡、又安可認爲對手、意國此項立塲、英國或不致提出異議、但當要求意國他日在阿比西尼亞編練黑種軍隊時、所定員額、勿任其超過實際需重、至對意制裁一項問題、意國當與各關係國分別進行談話、予以中止、不久當可撤消、特在行政院本屆會議期間、未必遽能辦到耳云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>否則國聯不能生存</p>
<p>開浦鎭　南菲聯邦總理赫索格今日在議會宣稱、國聯盡其責任、則必須維持對意之制裁、如有必要、須延至多年、如能出此、則意國終必被迫讓步、如國聯不繼續對意之制裁、則國聯不能生存、蓋無一國願再爲已證明其爲破裂物之國聯會員也、國防大臣畢羅起問、如北菲有大黑軍興起、則情勢將若何乎、阿比西尼亞之發展、已使此日之發現至少更近二十五年、往日虛幻的恐慌、今已成爲實在的可能性矣、司法大臣司末茲將軍起稱、在此世界遭遇可怖的景象與危險中、余意僅有直捷之一事可爲、卽忠誠爲國聯之後盾、以待意國被迫在國聯機構內成立和局而後已是、對意制裁、縱不能加重、至少亦須維持現有之基礎、如國聯會員有行此之勇氣、則國聯尙可保全、今日之選擇、非在此國聯與他一國聯之間、而在此國聯禍亂破壞之間云、（六日路透社電）</p>

<h3>美國發明的夜飛通信鴿</h3>
<p>— 蔣人傑</p>
<p>一九三六年的帳幕業已揭啟，世人常常所聽到的是第二决世界大戰的呼聲，報紙所閱讀的是列强軍備的數目字。然而有一件事是肯定的，即是二决世界大戰若果眞來臨，科學與戰爭的關係將更益密切，戰略將更趨科學化與機械化。現在，各國的科學家已在埋頭硏究。美國陸軍通信隊所發明的夜飛通信鴿使是一個好例子。</p>
<p>軍用通信鴿全是在日閒飛行的。若欲在黑夜間傳達軍事信息，普通一般軍用通信鴿即失去效用。美國陸軍通信隊以十年的努力與硏究，居然發明一種夜飛通信鴿，能在最黑暗的深夜，或是大雨滂沱的白日，大靈飄零，或細霧瀰漫的天氣中，將軍事信息用每分鐘一英哩的飛行速度，安全送達總司令部或其他目的地。這一羣黑夜飛行家，不但是美國陸軍在戰事通信方面上最近的發明，而且也是，一種最驚人的科學發明。</p>
<p>去年夏天，美國各處駐紮　隊中的通信隊，作過多决試騐，確實證明這種通信鴿與他種通信鴿比較，不但在黑夜飛行而且更爲穩妥可靠。不問它們是由在海上飛行的飛機中放出，或是由陸上高空的飛機放出，全能安然飛歸。平常則由廣闊的平原，叢茂的森林，或稠密的城市放出，絕對不致迷路失散。</p>
<p>例如前不久，在美屬的夏威夷羣島，美陸海軍曾作一次戰事演習，當時有許多轟炸飛機已飛出離陸地三十英哩以外，又正在黑夜間，飛機駕駛員乃試放一批這種新發明的通信鴿。這一羣飛鳥，居然在三十五分鐘以後，安然將信息携回達其巢窩，道若是在實際戰爭的時候，這些携回的機密軍事信息，其重要自然不問可知矣。至於陸上的試騐，在美國大陸稠密的城市中放出後這種通信鴿也能由十哩至十五哩之遙的地點安然歸返。</p>
<p>有人一定懷疑，現在是無綫電的世界，到處可用無綫電傳達軍事信息，並且無錢電的製造，日新月異，精益求精，美國陸軍通信隊，花費若干金錢經過多年時間，費去若許心血，來發明這些通信鴿，豈不是白費虛擲，愚笨無比嗎。實則許多軍事專家，現在確信在未來的大規模戰事行動中，靠無綫電傳達通信，將全歸於無用呢。例如據報載意大利無綫電發明家馬可尼已然發明一種極强烈電柱機能發射極猛的電力到飛機上破壞飛機上的電機阻止飛機飛行。在兩國交戰當中，攻守兩方都必將出奇制勝鈞心鬥角一些意想不到的科學方法全會實現。而此刻各種放射電柱的機器用以攬擾無綫電所發出的電信波，或是震聾無綫電的聽筒早已發明。這種電柱機隨時都能在一個較强的無綫電波音台，或是大的發電廠裏使用。就是在流動的行軍部隊中也能施用的。所以遇實際戰爭時，無綫電通信有沒有效用，全看戰場的位置如何，而概括稅，它的效用必然减低。那是就不能不依仗通信鴿了。因爲擾亂無綫電通信的電波浪不論多麽强烈，對通信鴿全然不發生影響。</p>
<p>這批夜飛通信鴿是在美國紐吉爾賽州蒙毛斯要寨區所訓總成功的。管理的專家爲羅斯。據羅斯稱通信鴿辨別方向選擇飛行航綫的方法，與飛機駕駛員航行飛機的方法，極爲相近，至於何以能如此，則莫明其妙。羅斯是養育與訓練鴿子的一位世界權威。他說「一般認爲通信鴿有歸家本能，所謂歸家本能最易令人誤會。實際上比本能要更强更重要。我想不出好些的名稱，不如呼爲航飛靈性。例如一位駕駛員面前裝置有許多精巧儀器，能吿訴他的飛機在何處應向那方面飛航。至這些通信鴿呢，也彷彿他們腦子裏裝有這類儀器，吿訴他們怎樣飛比儀器還耍靈騐。因爲牠們幷不是胡亂瞎飛，而是在空中航駛的。牠們遇見在風暴雨時，能向左方或向右避開風雨地帶繞道飛行，過後仍重新照其原飛的路綫前進。然而到底爲什麽牠們能飛返目的地，我也說不消，恐怕任何人也不知道。不過大概與牠們的兩耳有關係。因爲若將牠們的兩耳堵塞，就不能飛回了，眞是一件怪事呀。」據羅斯先生稱，通信鴿不但在戰時極重要，即在平時亦有用處。他認爲載客運郵的飛機，每决飛行時都應携帶一兩個通信鴿以備飛機出險時送信求救，以便立刻得到救援。</p>
<p>通信鴿有很高的機智與極大的勇氣。遇鷹　時知道迴避，且比鷹　飛的快捷。又能耐飛逮途。在美國，通信鴿所造成最遠的紀錄，是從西南部的塔克西士州到東北部的滿恩州共爲二千一百五十英哩，平均速度爲每日七百英哩。這僅是日間飛行的通信鴿所造成。若以現在發明的夜飛通信鴿當然尙不止此。</p>
<p>道一　夜間飛行家發明與訓練的經過，極爲有趣而奇特。開始實騐時，還是速在十年以前·在一九二五年間，駐在蒙毛斯要寒區的陸軍通信隊，從有老資格的日飛通信鴿若干種族中，特別選擇出十對最精巧機靈的。白日中，道十對鴿子永被圈困在籠中，待時近黃昏，這二十隻鳥即被携到離其原來住處不遠的地方釋放，使其試行飛回原處。這種訓練的方法繼續進行，漸漸將時間改遲，而離原處的距離也慢慢增加，到最後他們居然能在黑暗中山一英哩遠的地方飛歸。</p>
<p>用這十對受訓練的通信鴿作基本，使它們傳種播生。每一代鴿子皆受訓。傅種到第八代的鴿子時，他們居然一生下即有夜間飛行的特性。再加以相當訓練，即成爲現在的夜飛通信鴿。開始訓練是在鴿子從卵中孵育出來以後的第十八日。黃昏將近，幼鳥卽從籠中釋放，讓牠們在落棲的木板上站立觀察自已原住的環境，熟悉熟悉地理形勢。此後數日方開始絲習飛行。在黃昏朦朧中，把牠們携到的二百碼遠的地方放出，作初决飛返。漸漸的，過一星期後，這些鳥的夜間飛行特性即顯出，黑暗中能由一英哩外飛歸。從此每夜增加四分之一英哩的距離。後來一直增到十數英哩以至於數十英哩。訓練成功後，卽將其分爲三專，按照牠們夜間飛行最可靠的飛行距離，分爲五哩鴿，十哩鴿或十五哩鴿，以備應用。</p>
<p>夜飛通信鴿的飛行速度，也與日間飛行通信鴿速度相差無幾。依氣候及風向而定，的爲每小時五十至五十五英哩。現在他們所携的信袋，也經改良，幷非繁於鴿的腿部，而是束在胸前，作流綫型，飛行時，風的阻力大爲减低。因此每個通信鴿可以携帶三唡重的信件。對於軍事上誠有英大的帮助。</p>

<p>家庭生活從日常生活原料上看，北平一般價値，比他處實在便宜一點，比如，麵粉的方面，現在行市，福星牌每袋三元六角六，砲車牌每袋三元五角六，津稻米每斤一角零五，西貢米每斤一角，無錫米每石十三元四角，這些，尙不能算是便宜，而對於一般市民生活，有更密切關係的下面幾種原料，就更加較比便宜點了，比如，小米每斤六分五釐，棒子麵（卽玉蜀黍麵）每斤四分五釐，小米麵每斤四分八釐，牛肉每斤一角七分，羊肉每斤二角四分，猪肉每斤二角，菠菜每斤十二枚，油菜每斤四十枚，香菜每斤四十八枚，韮菜每斤二十八枚，芹菜每斤三十二枚，小蘿蔔每把六枚，（北平用大銅元，每個稱爲兩枚，所謂「十二枚」者，卽六個大銅元，以目前行市算，一個大銅元相當於京滬一帶的一個小銅元又三分之一的樣子），這麽便宜的價値，別的都市是不能此的。</p>
<p>一般上中級的家庭，主要食的資料，以米·麵·牛肉·羊肉·猪肉·等及各種菜蔬爲對象，屬於下級的家庭，則以小米·小米麵·棒子麵·及各種菜蔬。爲主要對象，此外，爲做任何食物所需要的煤。油·鹽·等類，照市價，元煤每百斤三角三分，硬煤每百斤四角五分，香油（卽麻油）每兩八枚，花生油每兩七枚，鹽每斤八十枚。</p>
<p>在通常情形下，上中級的家庭，用於在「食」的方面的錢，只少要比京滬一帶省得一半，一個月用二百元到一百元開銷，在這方面，算是最優等的，八十元到五十元，算是中等，（人口在五口以下的小家庭，比這裹數目還要省些），至於屬於下級的家庭，每個人，一天有一毛錢也就够吃了。</p>
<p>平民食品經濟情形，壞到連家庭也組織不起的人們，就只好去過這「平民」生活，所謂平民生活，就是有一頓沒有一頓，多掙多吃，少掙少吃，不掙不吃，一天吃一頓，是常事，他們掙到錢，立刻在馬路上買現成的吃，吃出力氣，再去掙，掙到了，又吃，（整個生活內容，就只有這兩伴事），主要的食品，是燒餅。油炸果子。（就是南方油炸鬼一類的東西）炸豆腐。饅頭·窩頭·（組棒子麵做成的）烤白薯等等，要是想渴湯，那就是三大枚一碗的餛飩，五大枚一碗的豆汁，要再切上十大枚的醬（猪·驢·牛·等肉皆有）做菜，那算是很豐富的一餐了。</p>
<p>通常一個人，一頓以二十枚爲度，超過一毛錢一頓的事，在他們是不常碰到的，過這樣生活的人，大槪以洋車夫。掏拉圾的小孩子。用取燈（卽是火柴）換破紙的老婆婆們·爲最多，所以，當你被十幾雙洋車夫們渴望的眼光包圍起來，而向你哀呌着：「先生。先生·一天了，什麼還沒吃哩」，或是，當你交一大堆破報紙給換取燈的老婆婆們，她們一面顫抖着枯手，只肯給你一盒紅頭火柴，一面哀求地嘟噥着，「先生，賞我多吃一個窩頭吧」，這些，倒全是實情，並不是做生意的法門。</p>
<p>飯館子北平飯館之多，恐怕不是身居南方的人們所能想像到的，大槪用「林立」兩個宇去說明這狀態，並不過火，人口衆多，是第一個原因，大家過的是不緊張的生活，因而有閒暇在這上面講求，是第二個原因，娛樂方法不多，只好把吃館子也當成一種娛樂，是第三個原因。</p>
<p>分起類來，大槪可以分成四類，　西餐館，　酒席館，　小吃館，　飯舖子，吃西餐，在北平並不通行，館子也只有十一家，比較著名的，首推廊房頭條的擷英番菜館，普通總在一塊五毛到兩塊八毛，就可吃到一客，酒席館，有山東館，淮揚館，貴州館，河南館，廣東館，四川館，及羊肉館，等等的分別，在這幾種裏，每一種總有牠底特色，也有牠著名的代表的館子，如山東館裹的東興樓，淮揚館裹的鹿嗚春，貴州館裹的西黔陽，羊肉館裹的東來順，河南館裹的蓉園，廣東館裹的東華樓，四川館裹的大陸春，皆是其代表。</p>
<p>小吃館之多，亦不勝枚舉，其特色有酒席館的口味，而沒有那樣整齊，北平酒席，十元左右算是普通，要是在小吃館裹，兩三個人對酌，有三四元也就儘够了，至於飯舖子，那是備單入零吃，或包伙食的，一個菜一個湯，普通一毛錢到兩毛錢，包伙食，一月七元到九元，這類飯舖子，顧主大半是學生，因爲北平學生很多，所以生意也大半興隆得很。</p>
<p>別緻的食品此外，北平著名的食品，如全聚德，和老便宜坊的烤鴨，安兒胡同王姓的烤牛肉，聚盛齋的醬牛肉，月盛齊的醬羊肉，沙鍋居的白肉，穆家寨的炒疙疸，都一處的炸三角，這些著名的食品，無論北人南人，凡曾在北平「獃」過者，沒有不去嘗嘗的。</p>
<p>我們可以總括說，無論貧富，吃的問題，在北平總比別處舒服些，便宜些，有個做過宣傳工作的朋友，向我說過，「北平人，是中國最難受人家宜傳影響的人，」所以北平社會，也比較死氣沉沉，然而近年來，却更加一天一天窮下去了，不怕北平人能忍耐，一等窮到連最低限度的「平民生活，」一般人也維持不了時，那時侯，這死氣沉沉的社會，或許會變動一下子的吧。</p>

<h3>我國僑務問題（續）</h3>
<p>— 周啟剛廣播演講</p>
<p>僑務行政的形態　上面巳將僑務之定義及國人對移殖問題之認識，的略講過現在要將我國僑務行政之形態，和華僑生存之關鍵，向大家申述，僑務行政，在我國政治歷史看來，實在是晚近才新創的，在前面也曾說過，我國是先有了「民移」的事實，才有僑務機關的組織，這樣的因果，與各國是相反的，我國之所謂僑務，以前實在談不到行政上的實際動作，因爲僑務機關，在歷史上衹有一個空泛的體態，而無行政上的具體權能，查我國僑務機關之史實，在民國紀元前五十餘年，即咸豐元年，淸政府曾就廣州天津厦門寗波等處，設出洋問訊局，那時候係一個禁管華工出口的機關，至民國七年，北京政府於國務院下，設僑工事務局，民國十一年，設僑務局，後改僑務院，其內容與事實，完全是一個空洞的機構，拿來覊縻僑胞，和緩和革命的東西，絕無所謂僑務方針，民國十二年，孫中山先生在革命政府大本營之下，設置僑務局，至民國十五年十七年，國民政府均設過僑務委員會，民國十八年，又將僑務委員會改隸中央黨部，凡此組織，都是爲應付華僑的人事問題，和促進革命的一個機構，迨民國二十年，立法院修改僑務委員會組織法，始將僑務機關，改隸國民政府行政院，民國二十一年僑務委員會改組成立，才成僑務行政機拂之雛形，然與各國僑務行政機關之結構相較，固望慶莫及，即與我們事實上所需要的僑務行政組織，仍相去尙遠，如　內部組織欠健全，有頭大尾小之象，　行政上缺乏統系的工具，國內各口岸，僑務局尙未完備，國外各地領事，仍不能直接指揮，　僑民一切狀况，未能作確實的調查與統計，所以對僑務的計劃，草能確立，　僑務人才，未能充分培植，致每有問題發生，都是被動的，作臨時之應付，效率幾微，　僑務委員會與各部職權未淸，遇事發生，則因各機關拘泥於相沿之條例與習慣，缺乏通力合作精神，諸事推諉遷延，致一切創作實施，輒受梗阻，以上犖犖諸端，皆爲現在僑務行政上顯著的不健全之形態，其餘通常常錯誤，如認僑務問題爲外交可以包括，甚至以僑務行政之施展，完全歸納到外交，殊不知整個僑務，决不祗是外交問題的一部份那樣簡單，我們根本要先明白僑胞移殖的史實，並不依靠外交而發展，我們以爲增進僑務行政之效率，初不在機關之大小，而在組織之健全，同時國家對僑務問題，要有確切的方針，大家亦明白，不是有了僑務機關，國家就算有僑務必要，有了僑務政策和行使政策的權能，才算有僑務，才能維持僑務的生命，在决定我們的僑務政策之前，先要認淸楚，人民移殖之興衰，和國家民族之榮枯，是息息相關的，吾則，如過去僑務與國家行政，毫不相干，甚至有人以爲，僑務委員會，是一個華僑團體，若照這樣的形態繼續下去，我國僑務行政，不祗過去數十年不生作用，恐再過若干年，仍脫不了因循敷衍不健全的狀態。</p>
<p>華僑生存之關鍵　諸位，我們要討論到華僑的生存問題，就該聯想到道千百萬的僑民，散佈了五大洲，幾百年來，無國力的保護，而能生存到今日，無疑的是有其特殊的生存條件，如　華僑能刻苦耐勞，在各國的勞働時間，現在已縮短到六小時至七小時了，我們的僑胞，多半仍是每天操作八小時至十二小時，甚至有更長的時間，經年累月，除了疾病以外，沒有停止勞働的，　華僑能冒險創造，舉凡歐美人士所不願做或不敢做，以及當地土人不能做的勞作，我們僑胞，都能本其冒險天性，創造精神，担當起來，拚命與天然界的障碍物奮鬥，以全副精神，創造事業，爲世界人類作貢獻，　華僑生活儉樸，取酬低廉，我僑胞無論爲工爲商，均以廉儉之生活，加緊其工作，本利人利己共存共榮之旨，適應當地的需求，絕無絲毫野心，純粹的爲社會服務，這是華僑能生存的普遍事實，共餘尙有偉大的和平品格，與堅强的民族精神兩點，更足爲華僑生存不減的根本因素，也得向大衆談談，大抵千百年來，世界上人類所做的事，多是含有强烈性的覇奪行爲，虎偽式的欺騙取求，而我們僑胞，本其偉大國民的和平天性，以謙讓相週旋，臨之旣久，當地人士，遂樂與交處，其有所謂排華者，都是少數包藏禍心，別存政治作用之徒所舞弄，若以普通的土人來論，確無排斥華僑的思想，這是値得人們研究的，又華僑去國千萬里，僑居百數十年，向無國力保護，又乏國家敎育培植，漂流於强烈的物質文明之國境，或野蠻陋俗的山野，自應受人同化，或被消滅，然而僑胞們不獨能保持着中華民族的觀念，更能進而熱烈的愛護宗邦，所以外人有稱爲「國弱民强之支那」的，這是華僑民族精神之堅强，亦是華僑生存的根本條件，所以華僑在海外散佈之地，我們常看見其生活上的習俗，都如在中國內地一樣，華僑住宅中，多有奉祀祖先的位置，並且假如係李姓的家，其鬥口則懸掛中國式的李府燈籠，姓陳則懸掛陳府燈籠，又如到處建築中國式的廟宇，所謂亞婆廟（即觀音）關帝廟，美洲又有所謂唐人街等，（華僑居住之地多保存中國習俗）驟聞之，自不免引起許多的批評，說他陳舊不化，但我們深刻的研究起來，華僑向來缺乏國家之保育，倘不能保存中國古舊的風俗，老早不是被人消滅，便是被人所同化了，那麽，今日之中國僑務問題，更何從談起呢，所以我個人不以華僑保存中國陳舊習俗爲憂，而以國家不施保育與放棄指導爲慮，不過若長此下去，華僑的生存條件，在今日看來，已不是這樣簡單了，我們要研究其今後的生存問題，除上項所舉之外，最低限度，國家社會，都要負起相當的責任，因爲時代的轉掄，决不容許我們再事因循了，在華僑目下所遭的困難與危險很多，我們的須以下的袖救，願與大家商榷，一。華僑本身的組織，在經濟方面，無論農工商業，均須急速推向集體化，决不宜像過去個人單獨經營的方式，因爲前者很像散兵戰今者應注意集團戰，二。華僑社會之組織，過去的分兩大部，在美洲側重姓氏的組織，（陳李張何黃之類）在南洋側重地域的組織，（如廣州潮州瓊崖客籍福建江浙之類）我不是反對這種組織，但以爲總要加以改善，擴而大之，假如以姓氏爲組織，不應有宗法主義存其間，假如以地域爲祖織，不應有部落思想存在，我們總理也提示過，由家族擴展到國族，是很重要的，三·舊時好的風尙，當然要保存，現在新的智識，亦宜趕快補充，以適應時代的需要，四·國家人士，對</p>

<p>華僑問題，不要隔靴搔癢，甚或置而不理，應明瞭世界問題，整個的是發展移殖問題，移殖失落，即國家民族生命之縮短，五·健全僑務行政之組織，確立僑務方針，培植僑務人才，六。積極的盡力發展僑民敎育，設法鞏固僑民經濟基礎，七·切實施行僑民移殖之管理，如指導保護監督調查統計等工作，以上所舉，是我個人對華僑生存關鍵的淺近見解，當然我國整個的僑務，不止如此，但我‘以為大體上總得急其所先，希望大家對僑務問題，把握着時代的需要，迎頭趕上，切實幹去，吾則，僑務前途，固多險惡，而國家民族的生機，亦要遭受影響了。（完）</p>

<h3>在金陵</h3>
<p>— 新運視察團　白流</p>
<p>烟籠寒水月節沙，夜泊秦淮近酒家：</p>
<p>商女不知亡國恨，隔江倫唱後庭花。</p>
<p>周圍六十里　廣的石頭城，也有過榮譽的歷史！六朝余粉，曾使這片天地熌爍！想像想像，在昔為帝王之都的時候，棲息於此的，何嘗不盡是衣冠楚楚的人物！旣是文化，政治的中心地，浪漫，黑暗也就蘊藏着，滋長着。秦淮河裏，畫舫來往。兩岸酒家笙歌澈夜。瘋狂的享樂。正像是靑春少婦得寵忘形！</p>
<p>然而，她可衰老了，現在她是個年暮的貴婦，她是被遺忘過的。現在又重　從遺忘裏被提了起來，可是那衰老臉上的微笑，是遮不了斑斑的淚痕！</p>
<p>六十里長的城墻，負着創傷，默默地，幾白年如一日。</p>
<p>奏淮河，像被遺棄的貴婦人的腰帶，依舊忠實地圍繞着金陵！</p>
<p>那密密的櫛比着的房屋，却不曉目覩了多多少少的人生活換；牠有着一個生靈活躍地到失了影蹤，到第二批的出現。牠看到一代一代的子孫的命運的變幻。</p>
<p>現在是，驕弱的子孫，日夜在風雨中掙扎</p>
<p>「能掙扎過來麽？」</p>
<p>一眞能洗刷了一切淚痰，恢復那可驕傲的容顏麼？」</p>
<p>本來，因着她地理環境的關係及歷史命運的决定，這社會一向總是前進的，當其他部分還逗留在中古的農村社會階段，而這兒却躍然欲動的進入了工商業社會形態，不過是在它發展的途中，却遭遇了阻得和破壞！</p>
<p>平靜的日子，漸漸有了擾動，終于洪流的衝進，動盪，洗刧了這個安樂的社會！</p>
<p>工業的幼苗被摧折了，被壓迫着只有病態地向商業之路發展，一切的民族資本，都變作了帝國主義者的買辦的過程，或者侵入了農村，集中田權，剝奪了農民的幸福。這種矛盾不解决，社會是更病態地發展！社會的暗影更將瀰滿了整個社會。</p>
<p>因為這個社會發展上遭到變異，牠的進步是十分遲滯的，經歷過多少的日子，那中間的進步的差異是十分有限。這社會的組織的階層，也變化得十分有限，因此牠的社會階層的分劃，還是表現着農村社會的形態，階層彼此間的對立，决不像工業社會的森嚴與懸遠！</p>
<p>大槪這裏的社會階層，是上層為貴族階級與地主，大商家，和少數的工業主。其决一層，為中產商人，自耕農，手工業主以及一般自由職業者。下一層却是小商人，佃農，及一般病態產物歌女，娼妓。最下一層却是貧農，工人，學徒及一般社會寄生者。</p>
<p>雖說是循着自然的趨勢，社會劃分了階層，然而這階層水久固定麽！彼此間永久隔離麽！　一種新生的偉大的力量，是企圖着控制自然的趨勢，把靑大白日下的社會一層層的陰影移去！在金陵，一二件奇蹟的突現，是預示着陰影移動着了。一絲的光明，是遠遠地在天邊熌耀了。</p>
<p>京市目前誠然是政治的中心，然而却沒有蘊藏着什麽腐惡。一切的公務員，都受過一種新精神的傳染，他們多巳變成或正在變着為一個新時代的人。這其中沒有一些腐惡蘊藏！最沂跟着市民訓練，公務員也舉行訓練，在朝曦初上或斜陽黃昏的當見，常可見到很多的鬍子花白的公務員站在隊伍裏「一二一」。</p>
<p>穿軍服束橫皮帶或斜皮帶的軍人很多，尤其是禮拜日，幾乎巷頭巷尾都有他們的影子，他們都是現代的軍人，現代中國軍人。人說時代可以在思想，文學，裏反映出來，我說在軍人精神上，也可反映出來。軍閥割據時代，有那狼兇虎惡的軍人；而在這時代沉悶巳極，社會即將翻身的時候，必然有一批新力量的產生。這力量是蘊藏在一批新軍人身上。他們都有純潔的胸懷，高超的思想與謙和的態度。公共汽車裏，他們常常讓坐，公益的事業，他們常常熱烈地從事，他們是有實幹的精神的。</p>
<p>這些這些，都是社會翻身的先兆！社會暗影是移動着了，一錢的光明遠遠地在天邊燜耀</p>
<p>不過是時代的矛盾的存在，社會的暗影是十分濃厚。</p>
<p>風寒的　日，一批批的鶉衣百結的人們，老的小的，在街頭巷尾瑟縮着，發着悽慘的哀鳴，粥廠門前成千成百蟻集着就食。</p>
<p>秦淮河畔增多了不少手粗脚糙的姑娘。傭工介紹所裏多少悽憐的目光在盼望着。</p>
<p>京市人口年有增加，影響到社會下層的膨大，這些人都是經農村來的。可見農村破產的嚴重！如江北一帶，連年因為水旱災的侵害和商業資木的侵入，剝削了一般中小農的土地。使他們在農村站不住足，只得到都市來找尋他們的命運，老弱的只有乞食，男子，幸運的找到點工做，不幸的迫於生計，只有流為盜匪，少婦入傭工介紹所，少女只有賣淫。</p>
<p>其决，京市為政治中心，一般失業智識份子，都到這裏來想找條出路。你如果到本京人以住家岸經營的小旅館去看看，有着不少的菜黃色的靑年在歇絲的里地，喫着燒餅度着過日如年的渺茫的日子！者每大也可以在報紙上到到一些失業靑年的生之哀鳴。</p>
<p>叫鄉農民摸着花斑的背皮流淚，貧民窟永遠冰冷着，孤苦無吿的小孩，日夜地在街頭叫賣，四千多的旗民，回憶到往昔的威武而發呆，棚戶裹常常充滿命運的咒駡，這些是更不消說的了！</p>
<p>然而，道些正是時代矛盾下的產物，要調整牠，除非是根本的解决這時代的矛盾！</p>
<p>我們要破壞一切限制我們生機發展的力量！我們要除去一切外來的險惡的壓迫勢力，不然，生機的發展受着限制，社會的病症是不絕而來！整個社會只聞啼聲與哀鳴！</p>
<p>金陵雖然是披上了新裝，廣闊的中山路，高樓與大厦，巍峨的政府機關，但總掩不住那寂寞的容顏與斑斑的淚痕！</p>
<p>明陵默默地覷着，中山陵也遠遠地在鍾山懸望！（完）</p>

<h3>紗花　利空之說復盛　紗市起驚人跌風</h3>
<p>市盤竟直綫下瀉　遠月暴跌三元强</p>
<p>紗市上日反動回漲、昨日復發生猛　之跌風、且局勢異常驚慌、良以市上流言紛紜、謂在美棉麥借欵、恐有成立可能性、於是人心不嚴、賣戶蜂湧而來、市盤直綫下瀉、標紗遠月暴落三元外云、</p>
<p>多頭　綫動搖</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、各月均呈呆滯無勁之象、一致微跌二·三·角、但塲中人心因上日現紗成交頗旺、賣戶未見踴躍、一詎料二盤以後、形勢急變、賣者紛沓而來、市盤步開步低、因空氣濃密、傳稅不一、皆屬利於空方、結果各月比上日收盤價均跌一元四五角至二元一角、午後開盤平庸、氣勢益萎、但入後原棉下落、現紗走銷不若上日之旺、且謠諑紛繁、多頭動搖、市盤愈趨愈十、結果各月比上午收盤價均跌六角至一元二三五角、五六月期復破二百元大關、查賣出聚興九百五十包、裕大二千一百包、大豐一千五百五十包、賡豐二千二百五十包、興昌一千五百五十包、養成八百五十包、大昌成一千零五十包、潤康二千二百包、經華九百五十包、同和一千一百包、合興二千三百包、泰興九百包、買進達記一千三百五十包、錦昌一千九百包、明德一千一百五十包、昶記一千七百五十包、森　九百五十包、慎記二千四百包、長豐一千四百包、信誠一千五百五十包、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>
<p>現紗跌勢尙綏</p>
<p>現紗銷路較清、查全日各幫買去統計八百三十二包、售價跌五角光景、各幫買額列下、</p>
<h3>存貨多流言熾　棉花慘跌一元</h3>
<p>棉市暴落、跌風之慘、為近來所罕見、此種情形、完全係粗絨棉存底太多、且市傳棉麥借欵恐有成功希望、於是賣戶愈形活躍、市盤難以支持、遠期狂跌一元云、</p>
<p>標花浮多紛紛斬結</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、美棉市况回堅、漲一至六磅音、印棉漲零　五至一羅比二五、大阪三品花漲一·三角、但市塲人氣極形虛弱、買戶缺乏、目謠言孔繁、謂棉麥借欵有妥協說、於是賣氣尤强、市盤步開步跌、六·七·八月期、一律敲破四元大關、結果各月比上日收盤價均跌三角半至五角、午後開盤市態依然不佳、一般浮多鑒於環境惡劣、忍痛斬結、市價直綫下瀉、結果各月比上午收盤價均跌三·四·五角、近日市塲變動之狂暴、及籌碼之擴大、前途波瀾、仍在驚濤駭浪中、查賣出潤康六千四百担、興昌一千七百担、合興四千二百擔、大豐二千二百担、長和一千六百擔、新昶四千四百擔、益康二千三百担、益昶一千七百擔、元一一千七百擔、賡豐七千二百擔、裕大三千七百擔、買進通記二千四百擔、德大二千擔、吉豐二千九百擔、長餘二千二百擔、慎記九千擔、長豐五千二百担、信誠六千四百担、瑞源三千七百担、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>
<p>現棉至銷堪云兩寂</p>
<p>現棉消費異常岑寂、廠胃閉塞、來源姚花二百八十包、通化玫百包云、</p>
<h3>最近一月來　標紗花起伏之因果</h3>
<p>最近以來、標凖紗花市况、直綫下瀉、且跌風益熾、來勢益熾、來勢洶猛、實緣在三月上旬、流言利多、金融界暨金業商·證券商紛紛大量吸收、造成四月十四日開盤之最高價、九月期標紗頂高峰曾達二百十三元一角、比上年十二月四日之商價、僅低三角、八月期標花頂高峰為四十六元　角、比上年十二月四日之高價漲過一角、繼以實銷不暢、客方購買力仍告薄弱、紗布倉庫存紗日增、超過三萬一千包以外、標花金融界雖投資、努力收貨、然各路粗絨趕運來滬、存底大增、已達八·九·萬擔、此項粗絨棉、一時廠方缺乏相當需要、同時中外各廠購訂之印棉、絡繹抵滬、已有五萬餘件、廠方暫可應用、目前無急需採辦原料、因此棉市急轉直下、棉市一軟紗市愈形不振、且其最大原因、謂華北走私益盛、影響棉紗極大、雖無實際布疋、大量運進、紗銷因之大减查去年此際、北帶購辦各紗有一二萬包之巨、於是一般空頭異常活躍、發生劇烈之變遷、市盤一落千丈、標紗比四月十四日之高價、近月猛跌十元〇七角、遠月跌十一元半、標花近月猛跌二元六角半、遠月猛跌三元二角、茲將最近標凖紗花高低價摘錄於後、</p>
<h3>印棉至八千包</h3>
<p>尙有萬餘包即將抵滬</p>
<p>印棉八千包、前日（五日）由大英公司之搭費利特號、自孟買運來、尙有一批、約一萬餘包、由另一輪船裝運、現已在途、約本月十四日可抵滬、該項棉花、聞係四川路某日商經辦、因船泊河筒、故於船邊提貨、由該商自行覓棧存儲云、</p>
<p>本市外棉存量統計</p>
<h3>美棉私家估計二則</h3>
<p>六日紐約電、番却兩公佈處本屆預估棉田為三二、一四〇、〇〇〇畝、上次（四月一日）為三二、九七〇、〇〇〇畝、又商報館預估棉田為三〇、九九〇、〇〇〇畝、一次（四月二日）為三一、一四〇、〇〇〇畝、</p>
<h3>海外棉市一致微升</h3>
<p>昨美棉市况、呆滯而帶堅定、晨初以外國政局及財政不定、殊形不安、旋以利物浦息良好、外商買進新棉、同業買進陳棉、市價上升、五月期在　角一分五釐二三毫時、囤棉處有售出、棉農亦有負買賣、惟為數不多、均為吸收、午後新棉有人套賣、同業及外商專購七月期、現需平靜、布市暗淡而堅、結果現貨漲一磅音、期貨漲一至七磅音、英棉現貨漲三點、期貨漲四點、印棉空月由近移遠及投機買進、遇多頭了結及棉商跨賣、計平果爾漲〇·五至一羅比、奧姆辣漲一·二五至一·七五羅比、白羅溪漲〇·七五至一·二五羅比、原電錄左、（六日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、七日七八月期白羅溪花開盤預測、為二百羅比、較上日漲〇·六二五羅比、</p>
<h3>三品紗花所漲甚微</h3>
<p>七日大阪電、三品期紗漲一角至九角、計近月為一百九十六元四角、遠月為一百九十五元一角、期棉漲一角至三角、近月為六十四元四角五分、遠月為五十九元二角五分、</p>
<h3>疋頭　標紗花猛跌　棉布遭挫折</h3>
<p>連日棉布因實銷發展、紗花堅挺、頗露佳象、詎料昨日標紗花又起重大變化、市價直綫狂瀉、棉布遭此打擊、市况即呈黯淡、客銷益覺畏縮不前、本街聞時龍頭·彩球等牌十二磅細布約一百餘件、天津幫進申新十六磅四平蓮粗斜三十包、此外閩廣長江等處、亦略有添辦零星夏貨與白貨、但為數不多、售盤平平、</p>
<h3>糧食　大戶不限價吸收　麵粉激漲五六分</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤、各月份忽呈巨大之變動、交易旣暢、市面之漲落、亦匪夷所思、此種情形、彷彿投機狂熱之境矣、當開價時、以洋麥報價祗有幾分及一二角之出入、故六月份開價、即鬆落至二元九角五分七厘半、惟反動之來、即由此發生、因大戶多頭、鑒於六月份之出粉難旺、故突起暢吸、不限價收買、是以各月份由此激動、亦紛紛反漲、　初　　好二三五分、半日交易、計達九十餘萬包、迫至下午開盤、六月份因仍有大戶收買、勢甚銳利、致一部分空頭、亟於抵補、廠空亦因之轉寂、是以開價步步高昂、六月份之收價、又漲至三元零四分二厘半、較上午開價、反漲八九分、餘亦較前日反漲三五分、　雙方之競爭、恐前途局面、又入混亂云、</p>
<h3>麥價亦隨粉市反漲</h3>
<p>昨日期麥上午開盤、各月份呈初平繼則反漲之態、開價時因洋麥報價、芝加哥好一二角、坎拿大跌四分、故六月份雖一度跌至四元二角二分、惟自七月份開拍、因粉市反漲、開價即昂、以後各盤、即因紛市之漲風、買氣旣盛、空戶又補、故即提　三五六分不等、迨至下午開價、因粉市續漲、人心亦步步帶高、較上午又漲三五分、較之前日差度、計好七八分至一角、新麥未見之前、漲　靡常、實少依據、此　為投機者所應留　也、現麥市面、見交無幾、價喊一角、祗三四百包交易云、</p>
<h3>客秈賴有內地幫購辦</h3>
<p>市面得以不墮</p>
<p>昨日客秈市況、以到頭不絕、河下米步步跌落、囤戶頗有貶價求脫之意、市形更軟、但內地幫趁此疲　至市問津砶糙各米、市面始得轉定、計辦贛晚糙二百七十六包、台州早米一百包、漢砶一百九十二包、溫州糙砶米五百四十包、又暹糙三百包、本街祗去贛機米一千零五十包、台州柳米三百包、然市面已得平定云、</p>
<h3>厚粳薄稻續跌角許</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各幫來源、較前略多、共到三十餘號、貨共七千餘石、故市况終雖振作、厚早粳價續低角許、薄稻包子、天津龍口幫、仍僅辦六七百包、故薄稻行情亦再跌落角許、北洋尖削一角、除變元無榮辱、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各幫來船卅餘艘、市上各貨去胃依然淡弱、市形高白粳勉定、中次者價短近角、杜尖貨稀價形定立、薄稻定局、羊尖高料定勢、中次者價帶軟、埠客尖亦見軟勢、其餘各貨、價均有下游趨勢、</p>
<h3>絲茶　法郎不穩　華絲輸法將益艱難</h3>
<p>二日來法郎突降、迄今匯率未臻穩定、故　荘絲市、頗為猶豫、人心　望、交易寥落、而法匯提高貼現、華絲輸法、將愈艱難矣、紐約絲市上海絲B字等級、昨告下跌、日絲八三分亦續降二分許、故上海絲市、經一度興奮後、昨日又復沉寂矣、</p>
<h3>英國加徵華茶入口稅　組荘紅茶每磅徵二便士五</h3>
<p>英政府最近頒布加徵、我國粗荘紅茶入口稅、每磅為二便士五、合華幣　茶一担、加徵十六元、按我兩湖福州等路粗荘紅茶、與印度錫蘭紅茶、　等品級、此次英國加徵華茶入口稅、其主旨在謀發展屬地茶業、而圖限制華茶競銷、至我國祁門浮梁至德等路紅茶、品質特殊、與印錫茶不相抵觸、不在加稅之列云、</p>
<h3>土荘新綠茶大批上市</h3>
<p>昨日土荘珍眉綠茶、公升永昇昌盛慎源等茶棧、又有二百餘箱新樣佈出、同孚協和等行均有購進、價開七十八元至八十五元、現下土荘廠家已有三十餘家開工、市面頗為熱鬧云、</p>
<h3>糖市　車白略見轉機</h3>
<p>枝赤昨開出千三百餘包</p>
<p>昨　市趨勢略見轉機、有回好之象、公會划盤、如二四粗砂白現貨轉口貨以及東赤白均持原價、而四號東白轉口貨且升五分、以六元七角半至六元八角划出六七百包、本廠綿白　記金心大華等貨仍平定、號貨前日所傳大批枝赤、昨已開出、共計一千三百餘包、價為十一元二角、因貨品參差不一、又值天暖易變、故扯盤兌脫也、又興化幫開出大貢粉白三十包、十七元三角、</p>
<h3>南北貨　龍口粉升四五角</h3>
<p>龍口綫粉干、近日客貨續有開出、價為二十四元三角至二十四元四角、較之前盤、又升三四角、因此行盤隨緊、北規售過二十四元半至二十四元八角、南規（九　皮）售二十三元半、均升半元許、客幫及本街銷塲、亦較活動、惟地價堅定、無甚更動云、</p>
<h3>漳州枝圓花苗均盛</h3>
<p>昨據漳州來客談、該處荔枝桂圓花苗現在極形茂盛、如經過情形良好、一無阻礙、則本屆新貨均將十分豐稔、惟陳貨確已有限、荔枝干已斷、桂元亦僅存少數小粒貨而已、</p>

<h3>阿發</h3>
<p>— 江京</p>
<p>很久以前，村裏人就說着那頭母黃牛是阿發的老婆。</p>
<p>有好些人去問過阿發：「你是不是討了母黃牛做老婆？」但阿發照例敵意地睜起他的小眼，哼一聲就走了。</p>
<p>沒有人曉得阿發是什麼地方人，來歷怎樣；他到這裏已經十幾年，現在五十多歲了。聽說起初他是叫化來的，後來找到短工做，才住下來，前年他害了一塲大病，再也不能做工，便祇好在如德公家裏做看牛。</p>
<p>他生得又矮又瘦，滿是癩痢的頭上有許多疙疤；一塊特別大的是在右頰上，把臉孔緊緊的拉得歪了起來。眼睛小得像老鼠一樣，看人時却閃着蛇樣般的兇毒的光；鼻孔很平，像給什麽東西壓　。這又醜又卑徵的樣子和那髒穢的色調，給人一種討厭的印象。「這傢伙一定是猴子打孕的，不是嗎便是打什麽毛坑攢出來的。」人們都這麽地取笑他，不把他當作個人類；頑皮孩子，還替他起了個「猴兒種」的渾名，常常在他背後肆意叫着。</p>
<p>人們的輕蔑，譏笑，甚至侮辱，阿發都不曾用動作或言詞反抗過；他永遠是避開眼睛沈默着，祗在那枯暗的眼色裏閃着一種兇毒的憤恨的光來，彷彿他內心正給什麽毒藥苦着。他會馬上悄悄地走開，絕不回頭看人一看，好像羞和他們站在一起。有人說，他從前還會跟人打駡，後來吃虧太多了，才變得這個樣兒。</p>
<p>但人們却因此愈要譏笑他，侮辱他，同時又都討厭他。沒有人把他看作同伴，看作朋友，對他說一句人與人之間應該說的話；他們祗會盒他來開心罷了。</p>
<p>「我們的阿發哥·——哈哈……」</p>
<p>阿發也絕不跟人來往，絕不對人說話；對他的主人如德公，也祇用最簡單的問答！「什麽？是，唔。」好像阿發看來，人類都是些不可親近的惡意的動物。他不特故意閃避一切人，而且故意閃避一切和人有關係的事；他的難看的面孔，永遠是死板板的，找不到半點人間喜怒哀樂的表情。人們也猜想不出，他的心到底是怎麽樣的。</p>
<p>然而他對於我却例外地表示若干好意，在我們之間，總算不少談話的機會，但他的話老是非常簡短的，最多也不過說五六句。</p>
<p>一次，我部　　於人的意見，他沈默地注視了我一會，才用堅决的口吻，冷冷的說：</p>
<p>「他們都是，——鬼！他們應不起我，我更瞧不起他們！」</p>
<p>在這世界上，他所愛的祇有那頭母牛。他每天為他割草，洗澡，捉虱，用冷水洗眼睛。他做這些事時非常用勁，高興得常常哼出一些連他自己也不曉得的調子來。</p>
<p>母牛一天比一天肥壯了，但他却用憤怒的眼光來回答人們對於牠的讚嘆。</p>
<p>他一刻不能離開他的牛，犂田時候他也要跟去；他總是用那蘊藏着無限情意的眼睛看着牠，有時還會忘形地微笑起來。看牛時候，他是不和別人在一起的，他帶牠到那些沒有人在的地方，很遲很遲才回來。可是這麽謠言更多了，人們都以　　的口吻說着：</p>
<p>「我們的阿發哥，是童男呢！」</p>
<p>但一切謠言和護笑，絲毫沒有損害他對母牛的感情。</p>
<p>一個夏日黃昏，我在人看不到的桑林看見阿發和母牛在桑林邊的田　上；這時田野靜悄悄的沒有一個人，祇聽到牛吃草的聲音。阿發站在牛的旁邊，用一種食饞的眼光沈靜地看着牠，有時會微笑起來，像做着什麽甜蜜的回憶。他不時溫柔地撫着牛背，牛頸，——長久地撫着，喉間發出一種低沈的，迷糊的，像是陶醉的聲音。母牛彷彿很舒服，抬起頭，馴服地搖着尾巴；這時阿發嘻嘻的笑起來了。</p>
<p>「唔，你道——他在牠背上輕輕拍着：一為什麽？吃啦。」</p>
<p>但母牛却吃起田禾來了。阿發焦急的托起牠的嘴，用手指敲着牠鼻子，敎訓孩子似的設道：</p>
<p>「唔，你這——為什麽這麽饞呢？吃草好啦。」他凝視着牠，眼睛裏有一種說不出的熱情。「唔，吃罷！多好的嫰草啊！」他微笑了。</p>
<p>可是黃牛却還要吃禾，牠　阿發爭持了；阿發用力的把牠拉住，黃牛搖着頭不住的噴氣</p>
<p>「噯，噯，你做什麼？———什麽？」阿發急起來，又把牛嘴高高的抬起：「你生我的氣麽？——」他聲音變得頽喪，臉孔現出痛苦的樣子：「你生我的氣嗎？是嗎？——為什麽呢？</p>
<p>牛不　搖頭了，却努力　把頸子縮回來，鼻孔　着　；「你眞個生我的氣麼？一聲　完全是顫抖的。他突然　　手，哭了。</p>
<p>他起初掩着面，吃吃的鳴咽，不久就放下手，重新拿起牛繩。牛是低着頭，也不吃禾，像人在後悔的時候。這時阿發却突然高興起來，忘形她笑了。他蹲下去嗅着牠的鼻子，又撫牠的眼睛：</p>
<p>「好吧，」他說：「我們講和，大家不要生氣了。——哪，吃啦，不吃要餓肚子呢！」他一壁揩眼淚，一壁又在微笑</p>
<p>去年如德公把黃牛賣了，賣時是瞞着阿發的。當阿發知道他心愛的黃牛永遠離開他，他呆了，無聲地流着淚。一個月後，他也死了。</p>
<h3>顫動的心絃</h3>
<p>— 江寄萍</p>
<p>紙的花</p>
<p>天氣晴朗得使人很愉快的，就是有點風，這是春天的一點憾事。院子裏的風也不少，可是這風絕不像冬天的風那樣的颳得人難受，這風像是有點詩意似的，一聽見這風聲，就會想到古人的詩句：「春風十里揚州路，」雖然現在的春風還不會有那樣溫柔，但總可以使人有點微醺的戚覺。院子裏雖然僅晒着幾件破舊的衣服，但被微風一盪動，那種姿態在春天的日光之下，覺得有一種說不出的美感。小孩子撕了許多紅綠色的手工紙，這裏一堆那裏幾片，倒眞有點像被風雨摧殘落在地上的，殘英和敗葉。一會兒的工夫，風又把地上的紙片吹到那兩盆枯了枝幹的月季花上去，遠遠的一看，紅的紙片夾在月季花枝的中間，眞像是枯了的月季又開花了，我心中十分的愉快，雖然明知是假的，然則世界什麽事又不是假的，可是這種愉快的情總是難得的。</p>
<p>想到玉蘭</p>
<p>不知道為什麽忽然想到玉蘭，而且想到很久遠的以前的事。那時在靑島，晚晌到棧橋上去，前面走的，是我的一個女同學，髮斜簪着兩朶玉蘭，風是暖的，把玉蘭的香味都蒸發出來，那時的感覺就彷彿剛打開一瓶很好的萄葡酒，把瓶口送到鼻上一聞，不須飲到嘴裏，已經有點陶然了。我們下了棧橋，又在海灘上走着，又靜靜的坐在石上看着隔岸的燈火，對着一片泓碧望過那邊的寒星遠市，心裹的情緒又立刻緊張起來，「兩三星火是瓜州」的詩句，又在我腦中跳躍了。那已經是五年的事了。她現在上那裏去了，又有誰知道？這種當時的景况，為什麽老不能消滅呢？太陽已經西斜了，淡淡的金色，舖在地板上，屋子裏不知為什麽相往日不一樣了，書架的書，書桌上的書，不知誰排列得那麼齊整，墻上的字畫，也顯得比往日乾凈了許多，說是愉快吧？又有點寂寞的悵惘。墻上掛的小條上的鄭板橋的詩：「大雪滿天地，胡為仗劍遊，欲談心裏事，同上酒家樓。看了這豪放的詩，似乎應當振作一點似的，可是身上總感覺軟綿綿的沒有力氣。殘照當窗，窗帘輕輕的搖動着，我像失落了一件什麽東西似的，總威覺有點悵惘。</p>

<h3>談「大衆誦述」</h3>
<p>— 荃麟</p>
<p>「大衆誦述」的最先流行的國家，是蘇聯與德國。第一個介紹到美國去的，是M哥爾特，他認為這是大衆文化上的最有力方法，和一種最有實用的藝術。在他出版的「一萬二千萬一集子中，收集了若干篇這一類材料。他很努力在美國提倡這一運動，勸導美國作家多寫這一類文學。</p>
<p>「大眾誦述」的形式是這樣的，用最簡潔而有刺激力的文字，寫成一種短勁的歌劇形式的對唱合唱和獨唱，用若干人（大概二十人或最多三十人）合着音樂來表演。這必須是可唱的，和能合於簡潔的音樂拍子的，不用說白，每一句句子必須很簡短，而有像一顆子彈一般的力量。用正確淸楚的咬音，很有力，不急促的念出，使每個字都能傳達給觀衆一種刺激，這裏當然需要一些激動性的材料，因此若干寫實的浪漫主義的成分是必需的。</p>
<p>「大衆誦述」的最大特點是演員不必盡在臺上表演，若千演員是穿着和觀衆一樣的衣服，混雜在觀衆中間。不須要化裝和打臉，他們的任務是在臺下作合唱或高呌。舉一個例來看，如哥爾特的「罷工」中，臺上一個「財富」和「貧困」正在對唱。</p>
<p>財富（迷着內慾的臉色，胖胖兒的一個人）</p>
<p>—你是誰？你可曾被邀請過？</p>
<p>貧困—（一個襤褸的婦人）（平靜地）我沒有被邀請過。</p>
<p>財富—那你為甚麽在這兒？滾！你這骯髒婦人！</p>
<p>貧困—我是貧困，你的姊妹子，你到那裏我也到那裏。</p>
<p>財富—（憤怒地）鬼話！鬼話！貧困不是我姊妹。</p>
<p>貧困—（本靜地）貪婪是我們的父親。</p>
<p>財富—（呌）滾！襤樓的婦人！我弟呌</p>
<p>貧困——（冷酷地）你慣是用這種手段對付我！……</p>
<p>這裏男子是一個單位，婦人又是一個單位，許多人的合唱又是一個單位，到後來羣衆中又發現了一個靑年領袖，和臺上臺下對唱，在末了時候若干臺下的演員便從戲臺旁邊衝上臺去。在悲壯的高呌和合唱中，結束了這一幕「大衆誦述」。</p>
<p>這方法顯然是給予了觀衆以莫大的刺激，他們往往會本能地和演員打成了一片，而跟着他們呌起來，哥爾特於那篇「罷工」的表演，曾經這樣說：</p>
<p>「觀衆驚奇起來了：他們不知道他們旁邊坐的是些什麽人—他們是這邊那邊的在呌着，唱着—戲劇的聲音似乎是從他們旁邊的人們中所發出來的。於是工人們和那些人一般的合起來，呌出激動的口號，和衝到戲臺旁邊去。觀衆逐漸逐漸的被四周的興奮所包圍了。他們成為演員的一個，他們成為戲劇中間「眞正的羣衆」。在那决「大衆誦述」快結束時候，池子裏的每個人都在喊呌着。</p>
<p>我們想想看那是多麽悲壯多麽振奮的一幕啊！這是多麼有効力的文學啊！</p>
<p>大衆誦述的第二個特點，是牠手續很簡單。表面上一看，需要二三十個演員，需耍音樂，似乎很麻煩，但是牠却是出乎意料的簡單！第一，牠無須富麗堂皇的戲臺和佈景，任便什麽羣衆聚合塲所都可以，甚至露天也可使得，只要有一個簡單的臺，和幾張桌子板櫈就行了。第二，除了二三個飾貴人警察等入須簡單的化裝以外，共他演員均無須化裝換衣服。這比態佛西的「露天話劇」更來得容易籌劃些。</p>
<p>關於音樂自然最好是有，但是我想中國音樂很不發達，或者初决試演時，僅用一只梵亞令或鋼琴已够用了。</p>
<p>這種「大衆誦述」需要一個很有魄力的導演，他的任務比話劇中的導演還重要些，演員必須很當心的背誦，和合着很正確的節奏和拍子的距離（Spaoing）。導演須注意避免因過度興奮而陷入混亂——這在初决試演時是很容易冒犯的。</p>
<p>大衆誦述的第三個特點，便是牠能統起强烈的統一觀衆的意志（Saedarilz）的作用。好像一個有力的演說。能够把觀衆一致的鼓動起來。這裏沒有個人主義，沒有主角和配角每個演員都同樣的重要。而更有意義的一點，是能使把這種表演變為觀衆自己的表演，將這種「大衆誦述」變成大衆自己的東西。這是多麼有力量的一種方法使落後的羣衆來接受文藝的使命啊！</p>
<h3>媳婦</h3>
<p>— 華沙</p>
<p>淸晨—是我來南頭鎭的第三天的淸晨。太陽剛從河對岸的遠方—村落的後面，漲紅着牠肥胖的臉兒，從紅霞里掙出身來。田野是平靜的，淸明的，雖然是初春時光，但人巳感到舒適和溫暖。</p>
<p>不知有多少獨輪車，車上滿堆着木柴和樹根，「咿呀，格隆隆！」的從左面小石橋上沉重的滾下來，滾過校門前。我就在這樣美好的淸晨，拿着一雙粘滿了汚泥的套鞋，向河邊走去。泥黃的河水慢慢的向下流着。一塊露出水面的方石上，立着一個瘦小的女人，提着兩件濕淋淋的衣服，正在困難的從方石上跨到河灘，慢慢的爬上岸來，樣子好似快要跌倒，她的頭髮可怕的蓬亂在臉上，使人祇能見到她的扁扁的鼻子和嘟起的小嘴巴。當她要立直身子時，她看見了我，奇怪的向我微笑着，露出她的大黃牙：</p>
<p>「你洗鞋子嗎？嗯嗯嗯，你有空到我家來玩啊！」</p>
<p>這女人出我意外的對我說起話來。我想她或是校內那一個小學生的母親，她或許是剛才生過孩子的產婦。於是我也笑了笑問她：</p>
<p>「那末你的家在那里呢？」</p>
<p>她用手裏的棒杵指着說；「就在那裏。」</p>
<p>我的視綫隨着她的棒杵望過去，就看見那方上有一間長方形的茅舍：</p>
<p>「哦！我沒事時來看你。」</p>
<p>她就頭也不回的分開她的赤着的半小脚，和車夫推車時一樣的緩慢地走了。</p>
<p>從此，當我有時走過道女人指點過的門前，我便注意着她，她老坐在門前的小木橙上，淸理着一些蔬菜或者是在洗衣服，動作是緩慢的，老是摸　着的。並且，從不抬起她的臉來。</p>
<p>不久，我終於找到一個機會，看見那女人和一個十二三歲的女孩子，在方場上掘着泥土，在泥土中尋找着什麽拋向那臘黃色的小鴨羣去，鴨們在蹣跚着，掙奪着，女孩子用一雙竹筷鉗着什麼東西，向那女人坐着的地方丟去。我很想知道她們這是榦的什麼，於是我走向她面前去；只見她的兩脚旁爬動着許多蚯蚓，而她似並沒和我說過話似的低着頭，把蚯蚓摘成一段段的，然後拋向鴨羣，她的兩手是齷齪膩滑的，不顧蚯蚓怎樣的在她手指上扭動，仍在抖索着木段似的手臂摘着。</p>
<p>「喂！你難道不怕肉麻嗎，這樣的弄着？」她好似並沒有聽見我的話。</p>
<p>「你就這樣整個兒，給牠們吃不行嗎？」</p>
<p>她仍不回答我，却把頭更低下了，她的赤脚趾在泥土上不安靜的動着。</p>
<p>我不知道她為什麽這樣漠然的在方場上慢慢的踱着。一隻小鴨伸長着頸項，搖着頭，半</p>
<p>段蚯蚓吊在嘴巴外面。女孩子見了，很生氣的叫着，「你道痴婆子！不摘得短些！吿訴娘去！」但我並沒見這女孩子動身，我就大步的走出了方場</p>
<p>以後，我每天見那女人，拿着一根小竹竿，坐在對河沿上，兩脚掛在河面上，河水從她的脚底下慢慢的流過去，有一羣小鵝在她的身旁草地上啄着綠草。有時我見那女人在欣賞着自然的美景似的盪着脚，把竹竿輕輕的敲着草地，有時死釘着對面的房子，當我每天走過小木橋回到住處去時，一定走過她的身邊，而我就因為那决，沒有得到她的答話，雖然很想問她，但總沒有這樣做。</p>
<p>時間又過了幾天，有一决當我正走到她的身旁，她又向我微笑了，而且在問我：</p>
<p>「你回去嗎」？</p>
<p>「是的，回去」。我說着，在她身旁略停下。忽然她指一指對面的學校說：</p>
<p>「你在那裏做什麼」？</p>
<p>「在敎書」。我說。</p>
<p>牠仰着臉看了看我，不信似的又可怕的笑了。這時，我從她那高捲起了褲脚的腿上，看到一塊塊的靑紫和血痕，脚背是發亮的腫漲着，頸上滿是條一條的指抓痕。這分明是受的傷。我於是就又想到她藍色的破布衣裹，也許還有更多我不會看到的傷痕。便問道：</p>
<p>『你的腿上是什麽？』</p>
<p>她皺着眉頭看了看我，才漠然地答道：</p>
<p>『婆婆打的。』</p>
<p>『頸上的呢？』</p>
<p>『姑娘抓的。』</p>
<p>『你的男人呢？』</p>
<p>『不見了。』</p>
<p>從她簡單的答話里，聽不到憤恨和痛苦。我奇怪她那種不在乎的表情。我想知道她在需要着甚麽？</p>
<p>『你吃過午飯嗎？』</p>
<p>『我是不吃的。』</p>
<p>『你有沒有銅錢……』</p>
<p>『銅錢……』</p>
<p>『你到街上去過嗎？』</p>
<p>『街上……』</p>
<p>『你想到城里去玩嗎？』</p>
<p>『城里……』</p>
<p>她都好像從沒聽見過這些話似的重複了兩個字，而且在思索着。她的聲音和蒼蠅似的在我耳朶里「嗯嗯」着，使人討厭。最後我說：</p>
<p>『太陽快要下去了，你不回去嗎？」</p>
<p>『姑娘還沒來叫我。』這時，她又在輕輕把竹竿在草地上敲着，顯出很天眞的樣子。</p>
<p>對岸有個女孩子很快的跑來，這女孩子就是我那天在方塲上見過的，她還沒過小橋就叫着：</p>
<p>「痴婆子！家去！「這女人驚赫得把肩頭一聳，從河沿上慢慢的爬起來，和女孩子一起拿着一根竿『咹去咹去！』的把鵝羣趕過小橋，回家了。</p>
<p>明天，那女人和鵝羣就再不在河的那邊出現了，我奇怪，我驚愕，我故意的在那女人的茅屋前走來走去。鵝羣和鴨羣仍在方塲上慢行着，女孩子仍掘着泥土，就只是那女人不見了，我想她是躱到那裏去了呢？</p>
<p>直到傍晚，我才又見那女人，額頭上包扎着灰汚的布巾，血從額上的布層裏淌到臉上，她把趕鵝的竹竿支撑着身體，跌跌歪歪的走出茅舍來。臉是灰黃的浮腫着，脚像兩根粗木似的向前移動。忽然有一個年的四五十歲的女人，從茅舍裏趕出來，一把抓住這痴女人的肩頭，兇狠狠的向後一拉，說：「你敢出去。』這痴人是跌倒在地上了。搶前一步，對着這老女人說：『你何必這樣拉她呢？」</p>
<p>這老女人把頭歪向我，更板着臉對我說：</p>
<p>「女先生；你有你的事，這不是你能管的事情，我家媳婦是痴婆子，進門三天就撤尿在新床上，鎮上那個不知道。』</p>
<p>「你旣曉得她是痴子，就不要打她，打是不對的。』我說</p>
<p>「哼！你倒會講，我辛辛苦苦秤柴秤不到幾個錢，送給你去養好了。』這女人把痴女人拖向我這邊來，又叫着：『你養她好了，我總不說二話的。」　　我憤恨的指着老女人駡了一聲「混蛋，」就飛快着脚步走出方塲去。</p>

<h3>阿京陷落給我們的敎訓</h3>
<p>— 筱山</p>
<p>全國的面積才僅是九〇〇·〇〇〇方公里的阿國，只有五·五〇〇·〇〇〇人口（其實阿比西尼亞種族只有三百萬人口。）這一個國家神聖的抗戰，支持到七個月，終是失敗了，五月五日阿京陷落，帝國主義的法西斯蒂墨沙里尼的軍隊終是佔領了全阿國了。</p>
<p>但是，我們决不敢為阿國嘆悲，而我們在這個戰爭里得到的幾個敎訓，第一個是帝國主義者間的互相排擠，進攻，而英國所支持下的國聯，無形中瓦解，曾嘩擾一時的「集體安全，」現在完整地成為泡影了。跟着這個條件的開展，世界上人類的大悲劇發生期更緊逼了。但是我們自不必去害怕，帝國主義者自身的痛瘡己不堪設想，决不是得到一兩塊殖民地就可以補償，正如意大利的侵攻阿國，發動全國，金錢生命，物產都犧牲了。就使得到阿國，那元氣也無法恢復的。所以，人類的大悲劇，更會嚴重地展開。第二個敎訓。魷是全世界的弱小民族都明白神聖的鬥爭是偉大的，是會勝利的。而目前阿國的失敗，其理由當然是物質落後，寡不敵衆，以一無援之小國，尙能支持八個月的帝國主義者的屠殺，而全國是一心一德，直抵抗到全國慘沒。由此可見，弱小民族的戰爭是何等的偉大，如果，全世界的弱小民族從這深刻的敎訓下，結成了鐵一樣偉大的營壘，我們相信，帝國主義者，就是八年…都不能壓服全世界的小民族的。</p>
<p>回頭看來我們中國的土地有一一·一七三·五五八平方里的面積，有四萬五千萬的人口，和阿國一比，就相差得遠了。阿國的人口不過上海一市的人口，而能抵抗八個月，所以，我們從阿比西尼亞得來的敎訓，阿國的失敗是光榮的，他們為爭鬥而死，他們為爭鬥而亡，我們要接受這一個偉大的敎訓！</p>
<p>特寫</p>
<h3>陸葉兩君詳述　發明旋轉式三用電燈泡經過</h3>
<p>— 雨</p>
<p>國人陸仲文與葉良兩君發明了和尋常不同的旋轉式三用電燈泡」，昨午記者往訪，承他們吿訴了許多發明經過的情形。</p>
<p>陸葉兩君，本來是在一家洋商電燈泡廠當工程師的。辭退後，感到現有的燈泡的簡單與不耐用，經過二年餘悉心研究，方把「旋轉式」用燈泡試騐成功</p>
<p>「旋轉式三用電燈泡」一共有二種，一種是有三種不同光錢的燈泡裏面有三根絲，上面一根絲是五支燭光的，當中一根絲是二十五支燭光的，下一根絲是五十支燭光的。變化關鍵是在特製的旋轉的銅頭上面，挿上去時是五支燭光。于旋轉，第二根絲亮了，變為二十五支燭光。再一旋轉，第三根絲亮，遂變為五十支燭光。這樣不啻購置三隻光度不同的燈泡。</p>
<p>還有一種，也是三絲的，三根絲是同樣光度的。當第一根絲斷了，祇要把特製的銅頭一旋轉，第二根依舊可以放亮光。第二根絲斷了，再把銅頭一旋轉，第三根也依舊放亮光。直到二根都斷了，才不能應用。這樣，無異一隻燈泡當做三隻燈泡用。</p>
<p>燈泡的式樣，完整的，有二隻是放在南京實業部裏呈請登記。能够給我看的，祇是一隻還未裝上銅頭的燈泡，那玻璃壳子是扁圓形的，玻璃壳子裏面是上中下三根燈絲。那銅頭呢？據說與普通的完全不同，質地很厚，是螺旋形的。脚下有四個突出的脚，陷在玻璃壳子裏，因為這樣在挿燈時不會因旋轉而不能挿上。銅頭的上端，普通的是有二點蛋形的錫塊，而他們的是三點很小的錫。旁邊還有一個鈎子形的東西，旋轉時電絲發生變化便在這上面了。銅頭的顏色是鍍過克羅米的。</p>
<p>以後還得有一種燈泡，是二用式的，那便是可以變化二種光度的。</p>
<p>價格方面，因為構造稍為複雜，成本大，售出的價格也就較尋常的稍貴。大概是在三角以上，四角以下。二用的可以便宜些。</p>
<p>電的消耗呢，也與普通一般的，這也許以後要用量電表試騐給大家看。</p>
<p>此項「旋轉三用電燈泡」已呈請實業部專利五年照准。粵商陳微宙君投資設立「中央三用電燈泡廠」於薩坡賽路，第一期的資本總額是九萬。現在已向中國榮昌廠訂購製燈機。</p>
<p>原料方面，除了燈絲和銅頭是美國貨外，其餘都是國貨。</p>
<p>機件裝配完工，約在二星期之後。正式營業，須得等有了相當存貨的時候。將來的度量是每天四五千隻。</p>
<p>他們廠裏的主要的製作過程有以下幾點：　心子，　燙鈎，　綳絲，　藥粉，　封口，　排氣，　校光，　銅頭　蓋印，　最後騐光，　　包札。</p>
<p>最後復由陸葉兩君領我去看正在裝配着的廠屋，那是一座小洋房式的統樓的上下全部，那裏匠工們還在大興士木，有一部份的小機件已放在那裏。</p>
<p>興辭而出後，我覺得很高興，因國人能多多地發明，不論大小，總是好事啊！</p>
<h3>摘棉花的女人</h3>
<p>— 東光</p>
<p>九月中，高粱跟玉蜀黍收割完了，赭色土地上只有一片片雪樣的棉田，夏天棉花秧的身幹是深紫色的，秋風把它的葉子吹黃了，華華地滾到原野上飛轉着的時候，身幹和枝子也變成了赭色，挑子像隻小鳥爪似的張開，抓着一把白漾漾地花朶，灰淡的天空下意外的空曠，每一片棉田中，有一個小小的蓆草搭的窩舖，有一個忠於職守的老年農人，他披着白皮面的山羊皮袍子，石像似的含着烟管，背上掛着笨大的鳥槍，在地的邊沿上巡逡着，替主人守獲着……</p>
<p>夜伴着犬吠聲飄過小河的岸，水淙淙的在獨木板橋下面流着，擺渡船掠過河而往返的漂蕩，這時，摘棉花的女人一羣羣歸來了。她們背着雍腫龐大的包袱，曲弓着身子，人埋在那包袱下移動着，打田埂上一行行地走來，沿着河坡，她們走到木板橋頭，高興的把大棉包丟到地上，仰了臉輕鬆的噓一口氣，倒身坐在棉花包上，直待擺渡嘰嘰呀呀的划過岸來，她們拐着尖尖的脚，撁了偌大的棉包跳上船去，便愉快的蹲下來，互相問着斤數和價錢：</p>
<p>「你給三興堂摘的幾個子（銅板）十斤？」</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>「兩大子兒。（卽合四個小銅板）」</p>
<p>「我們三個半小子，明天我不給馬家摘了。」</p>
<h3>張叔通先生近作（余山風景）</h3>
<p>這都是一些年靑的婦人和姑娘們，秋天小戶人家把自己的事情作完了，男人們到荒野裏拾柴草去，女人們便替地主家去摘棉花，她們從七月末便到棉田中「一噴」（就是整塊棉田裏都長齊了棉花的一段時候）又「一噴」的去摘，消着大顆的汗珠，在毒熱的太陽下，在早秋的晚風中，工作着，不願說一句閑話的忙碌着，直到天夜了，才背起大捆的棉包——那都是這一天手不停息摘來的，雖然沈重得壓弓了腰，却沒有一些怕它，有時倒恨它不更重一些。——渡過河，一羣女人身後跟着地中家的「管事的」，一個穿長衫，手裏拿着一雙光胡桃，或鼻烟壺的斯文先生。</p>
<p>她們跳下船來，揹着自己的包袱，艱難的喘着氣曳過一段沙灘，爬上坡，村中的燈火亮了，炊烟一層層迷漫着天上的星子，一羣人走向村南頭的馬家去，另一叢拐過屯鹽的塲棧，———那山樣的鹽堆上已點着一顆紅色的警燈了。</p>
<p>她們像一批遭了水災的難民似的，黑叢叢的一個行列，沿着高大的白石灰墻，進了三興堂的大門，依着自己所領到的竹板籌，背着棉花去稱，棉包從那大架秤　降下地來。錘綫打在那裏，秤杆抬得多高，摘棉花的女人只有睜起兩隻發火的眼睛，一聲不敢嚮的嘆口氣，待那個抉秤杆的小伙子嚷：</p>
<p>「七十斤」！</p>
<p>「我只七十斤哪？」</p>
<p>「多少？一百斤？把你也加上末」。</p>
<p>無言的受兩句奚落，賬房先生把錢數給她，收回籌去，另一個老母夜叉樣的女人走來，拉到旁邊去搜搜褲子，看有沒有偷起一團棉花來，搜完，便很快的哄出大門去了。</p>
<p>在回家的路上，她們一個個地數着銅板，忘記了疲倦和汚辱，想着一天的工夫完了，便可以給孩子，給弟弟，買一尺布，一個大餅，或給自己買一包針，一束綫，永遠是良善的，樸實的，打發着一串未來的艱苦日子。</p>
<h3>送呆神</h3>
<p>— 方舟</p>
<p>—鄉風綴拾—</p>
<p>東邊的半天給剛爬出地平綫的太陽燒紅着，山坡前的松林上已洒着一層金色的彩輝，和暖的空氣漸漸地把雙塔村包圍了起來，荷葉嶺傍邊那條河流里的水是在靜靜地淌着。</p>
<p>早飯的時候，遠遠地有一陣嘈雜的喝麽呌嚷聲從石皮路上傳過來，村犬是狺狺的狂吠着，跳到東縱到西的彷彿瘋狂了一般，這寗靜的村子頓時給掀起了不安的騷動，而且這聲昔是越來越近，像是要把人們的耳膜都震碎似的。</p>
<p>「他們在替莫阿福娘子送呆神！」阿才捧着飯碗說。</p>
<p>「你們不要出去，別耍也去撞着了呆神！」阿才的媽對大家可囑不要去看，要是誰去碰到了呆神會同莫阿福娘子一樣地發武痴—摔傢伙打人——的。</p>
<p>可是，茶亭前的井邊上及斷頭塔下終於擠滿了一堆人，男的，女的，老的，幼的，都點起了脚跟在向石皮路上望。</p>
<p>在石皮路上的靑石橋邊，有一簇靑年漢子，「嘩啦！嘩啦！」的擠在一起在奔，大銅鑼「瞠！瞠！」地敲着，敲得震天價響；兩個小夥子扛着一隻破柴蔀，莫阿福娘子給捆縛像猪仔似的裝在里面，由大家擁着搖啊擺的跑；在山里，在田邊，在澗畔奔跑，一路奔跑，一路將蔀拚命的震盪，有時在半山麓把部連入滾下山來，滾到平地上再扛了跑，使莫阿福娘子坐在里面戚到彷彿天翻地覆的恐怖，難過。</p>

<h3>The Remaining Bandits in Shanxi Province to Be Completely Eliminated Soon; Part of the Shanxi Army Has Already Crossed the River to Pursue and Suppress; Bandits Fled Back to Northern Shaanxi, Reaching 5,000 People</h3>
<h3>Yan Orders Strict Military Discipline and Construction of the Pingfen Railway</h3>
<p>(Taiyuan) The remaining bandits in western Shanxi have mostly fled westward. A strict search and suppression is underway for all scattered bandits, and they can be completely eliminated within three to five days. A portion of our forces has already crossed the river in the Yonghe area to pursue and suppress them. On the 7th, the stationed troops in Xiaoyi, Fenyang, and other counties received orders to return to their posts. Yan and Yang Aiyuan jointly telegraphed the armies, stating that they should not pursue speed excessively in their movements, but must maintain strict military discipline, and those who violate it will be held accountable, with the commanding officers bearing responsibility. Regarding the dispatch of troops into Shaanxi to pursue and suppress the bandits, Yan is currently ordering the expedited construction of the Pingyao to Fenyang railway and is carefully planning methods for coordinating the armies entering Shaanxi. Yan hosted a banquet for the generals at the Sui Garrison Headquarters this evening. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) The bandit gangs led by Mao, Xu, and Lin in western Shanxi have now mostly crossed the river and fled westward. Our army is maintaining strict defenses along the Yellow River, locking down the riverbanks, and actively suppressing them. It is reported that, in order to increase the strength of the bandit suppression forces, a large army will be drawn from within Shanxi Province to cross the river and assist in Shaanxi. Director Yan plans to immediately dispatch a large army to cross the river to pursue and suppress the communist bandits in northern Shaanxi. On the 6th, he ordered the engineering corps and road construction teams to complete the Pingyao to Fenyang railway within ten days, and to continue surveying westward from Fenyang, actively constructing the railway. Personnel from the bureau departed on the 7th to handle the construction work. (7th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>Deng Baoshan Arrives in Beiping for Talks</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Deng Baoshan, commander of the newly formed 1st Army, arrived in Baoding yesterday from Bingzhou to meet with Wan Fulin and Zhang Yunrong. He discussed the suppression of bandits. He arrived in Beiping tonight. According to him, he plans to rest in Beiping for a few days or go to the capital for a trip. Most of the Shanxi bandits have fled back to northern Shaanxi. Only two to three thousand bandits remain in Shanxi, and they can be eliminated in a short period. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Deng Baoshan said that after the communist bandits entered Shanxi, there were three major battles with the government army. More than 7,000 communist bandits were killed or wounded, and many were captured. This time, 5,000 people fled back to northern Shaanxi. Those who remained in Shanxi to cover the retreating troops numbered about two to three thousand and are currently being besieged by the Shanxi army. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Deng Baoshan arrived in Beiping from Shanxi at 7:30 PM on the 7th. According to him, his troops are currently stationed in Gansu, where the area is still peaceful. However, winter snow and spring rain have caused disasters, especially outside Jiayuguan. Many people there have fled to make a living. The bandit suppression in Shanxi has come to an end. Only two to three thousand remnants remain, and they will soon be eliminated. There were three major battles with the Red bandits in Shanxi, resulting in seven to eight thousand deaths. Many were also captured. There are two reasons for the bandits' defeat in Shanxi: 1. Shanxi has convenient transportation, and the national army moves quickly. 2. The political foundation is good, and there are fewer unemployed vagrants, so the communist bandits cannot incite them to resist the national army. Although the Shanxi bandits have fled, the aftermath is quite important. Director Yan is currently planning everything to restore vitality as soon as possible. After these Red bandits fled to northern Shaanxi, the national army has pursued them to the riverbank. It is expected that they can also be eliminated in a short time. I have no mission in Beiping, and it is not yet determined whether I will go to the capital in the future. (7th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3>People's Petitions Must Follow Procedures</h3>
<h3>The Executive Yuan Orders All Provinces to Comply</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan recently discovered that local government offices often claim that the people are unfamiliar with the legal procedures, resulting in inconsistent petitions. Therefore, they have created a kind of administrative petition form, stamped with the official seal, and required people to purchase and use it, charging one or two dimes per copy. In some cases, the government offices also limit the drafting of the people's petition manuscripts to the form-selling office, charging fees. This kind of practice not only violates the central government's laws and regulations but also hinders the people's litigation and should be abolished immediately. On the 7th, it was announced to all provincial governments to investigate the situation of people's petitions in their areas. If the paper used does not conform to the format, they should immediately comply with the order on unifying official documents issued by the National Government on January 18, 1929, and the format and instructions for appeal petitions issued by the Executive Yuan on August 29, 1934, and make clear announcements to comply with them.

<h3>The Italo-Ethiopian War Comes to an End</h3>
<p>--- By Bin</p>
<p>After seven months of arduous and courageous struggle, suffering countless dumdum bullets and poison gas attacks, and under the advance of 500,000 Roman troops, Abyssinia finally fell. The "King of Kings" quietly sought the protection of a British warship and fled to Palestine. Badoglio's troops marched triumphantly into the Abyssinian capital. Rome was filled with jubilation, while Addis Ababa was filled with desolation and chaos. The war of resistance of a small Eastern African nation for half a year has thus come to an end.</p>
<p>Abyssinia has fallen, but its fall is glorious. When the war began, many proponents of non-resistance thought that Abyssinia's resistance to Italy was tantamount to hitting a rock with an egg, saying that Italian troops could capture the Abyssinian capital within ten days. Mussolini also boasted that he would spend Christmas in Addis Ababa. But what were the facts? Yes, Abyssinia's weapons were far inferior to Italy's. Italy had the latest 20th-century tanks, while Abyssinian soldiers held 18th-century rifles. Italian troops had all kinds of new and strange poison gases, while Abyssinia did not even have gas masks. However, the morale of the Abyssinian army was strong and enthusiastic. Abyssinia, whose cannons and planes were inferior to those of the enemy, relied on its only heroic morale to hold out for seven months. If not for strategic errors, it might have been able to continue and threaten Italy's existence (Italy's war expenditure has reached 6.5 billion lire, and its treasury is impoverished and can no longer sustain it for long). This is something we cannot ignore.</p>
<p>We can also learn two lessons from Abyssinia's failure. First, we see that the League of Nations is fundamentally unreliable. Since the "September 18th Incident" in 1931, the League of Nations has already proven its uselessness. This time, it has been tested once again. When the Italo-Ethiopian War broke out last year, the League of Nations launched sanctions against Italy, but ultimately, due to the interests of various countries, they were unwilling to implement them effectively. For example, France, in order to win over Italy to counter Germany, has always been unwilling to excessively sanction Italy. The United Kingdom, whose interests were involved, took a relatively strong stance, but only took actions on paper. Under the constraints of the conflicting interests of various imperialist powers, the League of Nations is only a guise for them to protect their interests. The fact that Abyssinia has failed proves this point even more. Second, we see that strategy is indispensable. Given Abyssinia's military equipment and geographical environment, it should have used a feint-and-attack method to disperse the elite of the Italian army. However, in the past, it mostly adopted a group combat method, which was a strategic miscalculation. Because its regular army was only 500,000, while the Italian army had 5-600,000. Given the inferiority of its military equipment, it would naturally be easily hit hard by using a large army to resist head-on. If it could not only fight with the regular army but also organize countless guerrillas with millions of strong men across the country to attack the enemy's flanks, it might have been able to win. However, organizing the masses naturally also has difficulties, because a feudal monarch inevitably has barriers with the people on weekdays. Even if they have the determination to resist the enemy, traditional conditions limit their ability to organize the masses. From this, we can see that the leader of a country is very important, and the unity of the upper and lower levels is even more meaningful.</p>

<h3>Second Day of Japanese Diet Session: Questioning Turns Fierce</h3>
<p>Finance Policy Becomes the Target of All</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The House of Representatives plenary session convened at 1:10 PM today.  At the outset, Koosaku Maeda (Independent) requested to speak regarding the conduct of the proceedings, but Speaker Tomita refused.  The session continued with questions on the policy address. Masanori Katsu of the Minsei Party took the podium to question the government on financial and economic issues.</p>
<p>Katsu Masanori asked: How many years will it take to strengthen national defense facilities and industries? How much will national expenditures need to increase?  Given the established outlook for future annual expenditures, can we plan to increase revenue and stabilize finances? And over how many years do you plan to implement this plan? What is the scope and extent of the tax increase plan? Will the low-interest policy not hinder the development of trade?</p>
<p>Minister of Finance Baba replied: The increase in national defense spending from 1937 onwards cannot be specifically determined. Future revenue and expenditure cannot be clearly stated.  The tax increase issue also cannot be clarified.</p>
<p>His answers were too abstract, causing an uproar among the Minsei Party members, who questioned if this was truly a Minister of Finance. They argued that even former Minister of Finance Inoue had presented a policy.</p>
<p>Katsu Masanori returned to the podium and expressed his regret at the Finance Minister's response, ending his questioning.</p>
<p>Then, Zenbee Horikiri of the Seiyukai Party took the podium. He first criticized the government's indecisiveness, stating that the Hirota Cabinet claimed to be a government that would reform all aspects of administration, but the budget proposal was merely a complete continuation of the previous cabinet. Although they claimed there was not enough time, fifty days had passed since the cabinet was formed, and it was unclear what they had been doing. He then stated that to establish a financial plan for the future, it was necessary to thoroughly examine the important areas of both revenue and expenditure. National defense spending should not be decided solely by the military but must be based on the economic strength of sixty million citizens. If the Finance Minister follows the military and only listens to their demands, implementing inevitable tax increases, the people will not be able to bear the burden. Behind the nation are sixty million taxpayers, which must not be forgotten. Finally, he discussed the relationship between industry and finance before leaving the podium.</p>
<p>At this point, Toyokichi Tabuchi requested to speak, but the Speaker refused. Tabuchi continued to repeatedly request to speak. The Speaker then ordered him to leave the chamber.</p>
<p>Takao Saito of the Minsei Party took the podium to question the reform of the political structure. He then asked whether the current cabinet had confidence in securing peace in East Asia, and further inquired about military interference in politics, touching on the February 26th Incident. He accused the government of suppressing speech and the military of appeasement tactics. Prime Minister Hirota replied that the political goal was to realize constitutional politics. If there were any obstacles, they would be reformed. This was his fundamental concept of reforming the political structure. He then stated that the state of peace in East Asia was not ideal at present and that he would work to secure it. Minister of War Terauchi also stated that in these extraordinary times, he would do his best to serve the country sincerely.</p>
<p>Later, Shigeharu Kasai (Independent) questioned the anti-Japanese problem in the Philippines.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Arita replied that Philippine President Quezon would handle the issue with goodwill if it contained importance, and the Foreign Ministry was also taking every measure to protect rights and interests.</p>
<p>The various responses concluded at 6:06 PM when the session adjourned.</p>
<p>Mr. Mikami questioned the issue of clarifying the national essence, stating that Mr. Hakuseki Arai had attacked the characters "Hua Tai" (華泰). He felt it was not beautiful to have the nation use the four characters "Republic of China," in order to maintain the dignity of Japan's independence and clarify the national essence. He questioned the Foreign Minister's belief.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Arita expressed agreement with the intention of clarifying the national essence. However, the four characters "Republic of China" were used to treat the people of neighboring countries as historically inferior, so they were not specifically used towards Japan. After responses from Minister of Education Hirao, and others, the session adjourned at 4:35 PM. The questioning battle will continue tomorrow at 10:00 AM. (7th, Dentsu Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Questioning on the February 26th Incident</h3>
<p>Terauchi Only Provides Simple Answers</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The House of Representatives held a closed session on the 6th to discuss the February 26th Incident. First, Minister of War Terauchi gave a detailed report on the army's investigation into the incident, the status of the trial, and the future of martial law. Then, the questioning began. Initially, Soichi Yamamichi spoke, providing detailed opinions on the military's stance on relations with the United States and China, as well as educational issues, and then questioned various matters such as the incident's background, funding, and the military's actions immediately after the incident. Terauchi replied to this, first describing the current state of military education, and regarding foreign affairs, stated that they would deal with them in unison with the military. Next, Hokushin Kitaki rose to question about ideological issues and the military purge, and then further questioned the relationship between the May 15th Incident and the February 26th Incident. Minister of War Terauchi gave simple answers to each matter. Seiichi Aoki then spoke, stating that the Minister of War had previously said that he would explain the contents of the incident in detail in a closed session, but according to the current explanation, he had not touched on the contents. Although the Minister of War said that this was the maximum extent of the answer, a considerable amount of time had passed since the incident occurred, and it was expected that the authorities would have already known the contents of the incident. He asked for a more detailed answer. The seriousness of this incident was unprecedented, and the people were also very concerned about it. Kitaki then questioned the future of martial law, the investigation into the contents of the incident, and the background. After Minister of War Terauchi replied to this, he said that the timing of the lifting of martial law could not be stated. Next, Jotaro Kawakami asked: What was the purpose of the incident? What was the activity of the communist elements? What was the army's determination to purge the military? Akira Kazami asked: What was the attitude of the units participating in the incident? What was the state of security immediately after the incident? What was the funding relationship? What was the background relationship? What was the status of the trial of the Aizawa assassination of Nagata? What was the responsibility of the authorities for the incident? Were there any members of the Diet who were involved in the incident? Terauchi gave simple answers to the above questions, stating that the funding relationship was currently under investigation. The army was regrettably unable to anticipate the occurrence of the February 26th Incident. He had now realized and would thoroughly carry out a military purge to prevent such an unfortunate incident from happening again. At this point, the session was adjourned. (7th, Domei Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The government had explained the specific facts of the February 26th Incident in a closed session on the 6th. In the future, in the House of Representatives session, if there are any questions regarding this incident, the government would not answer them, using the reason that the content of the incident had been explained to the fullest possible extent in the closed session on the 6th. It has been decided to stop questioning about the February 26th Incident with the closed session on the 6th. (7th, Domei Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Japanese Foreign Ministry Formulates Plan to Control Cotton Industry in North China</h3>
<p>To Be Implemented After Diet Approval</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the economic development of North China, the Japanese Foreign Ministry has formulated a plan based on the results of discussions at the North China Japanese Military Officer Conference and is preparing to submit it to a special meeting for approval and immediate implementation. According to sources, the proposal includes increasing the cultural project expenditure for China to four million yuan. After approval, the following steps of control will be implemented in the North China cotton industry, starting with the Qingdao and Tianjin Natural Science Research Institutes: Expand cotton planting areas. Thirteen cotton planting guidance zones will be established in Beijing, Tianjin, Yi County, etc., and specialized personnel will be dispatched to provide on-site cultivation guidance. The cotton fields in each zone will be expanded to 5,000 to 10,000 mu. Establish sales cooperatives. Sales cooperatives will be established in each village or in a combination of up to four villages to provide financial assistance during sowing and cotton planting and to introduce sales at harvest time. Control cotton experiment stations. The Ding County cotton farm and the Nanyuan cotton production improvement center are now under the North China Cotton Industry Improvement Association. In the future, under the policy of controlling all cotton farms in North China, it has been decided that this year, the cotton experiment station under the Nanjing Ministry of Industry will be merged with the improvement association. (7th, China United Press Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Budget General Meeting Schedule Determined</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the House of Representatives' budget bill review, the board of directors decided today as follows:</p>
<p>Budget General Meeting from the 8th to the 12th, Budget Subcommittee meetings on the 13th and 14th, questions from each faction on the 15th, decisions by each subcommittee on the morning of the 16th, and the budget will be sent to the House of Peers for resolution at 1:00 PM on the same afternoon.</p>
<p>Also, in the House of Representatives session, four members each from the Minsei Party and the Seiyukai Party will take the podium in alternating order to ask questions, followed by one member each from the Showa Society in the Second Resting Room and the Kokudo Party in the First Resting Room, for a total of twelve members. In addition, the budget general meeting will be held from 9:00 AM to the evening to promote the proceedings. (7th, Dentsu Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The government will add the part originally calculated as the implementation budget as Additional Budget No. 1, totaling more than 360 million yuan, which has been submitted to the House of Representatives. Afterwards, the requests for additional funds from each ministry will be added as Additional Budget No. 2, amounting to approximately 7.2 million yuan in the general account, which was decided in the Cabinet meeting in the Diet on the 7th and can be submitted to the House of Representatives recently. If this Additional Budget No. 2 is added to the already decided implementation budget, the total amount of the general account implementation budget for the 11th year (Showa 11) will reach more than 2.31 billion yuan. However, the shortfall in revenue among the implementation budget is 5.9 million yuan, which can be reduced by a second public bond loan. Therefore, in the end, the burden of interest on the public bonds for the expenditure can be reduced. Thus, the total amount of the general account implementation budget for the 11th year (Showa 11) will actually be 2,304,586,000 yuan. (7th, Domei Telegraph)</p>
<h3>After the French House of Representatives Re-election, the Socialist Party Will Form a Cabinet</h3>
<p>The Communist Party Promises Support</p>
<p>(Paris) After the new House of Representatives convenes, the leader of the orthodox Socialist Party will come out and form a cabinet. Political figures are making various speculations about the cabinet member candidates, sometimes wildly. The *Affaires* and *L'Écho de Paris* have recently revealed the most widely circulated list. According to reports, it is not yet known whether Prime Minister Léon Blum will also serve as Foreign Minister. If he does not agree to serve concurrently, then the position of Foreign Minister will be held by the current Minister without Portfolio Pengu (leader of the Republican Socialist Union Party). Former Prime Minister Daladier, leader of the Radical Socialist Party, will serve as Minister of State and Minister of Justice, or Minister of War. Olivier, the Socialist Party's financial expert, will definitely succeed as Minister of Finance. Salengro, a member of the House of Representatives (Mayor of Lille), will serve as Minister of the Interior. The positions of the two naval and air force ministers will be held by members of the Radical Socialist Party. The position of Minister of Aviation will still be held by Cot (Minister of Aviation in the Daladier Cabinet), and the position of Minister of the Navy will be held by the current Prime Minister Sarraut. (7th, Havas Telegraph)</p>
<p>(London) Léon Blum, leader of the French orthodox Socialist Party, is about to become Prime Minister. He recently gave an interview to the *Daily Herald*, the organ of the Labour Party, saying that after the Socialist Party comes to power, it must work to promote a convention on the reduction of armaments. "France now intends to fully support the principle of collective security. If Britain abandons this great plan at this time, there may be no greater tragedy in the world. France must support the collective actions led by the League of Nations, and Britain can fully trust it," he said. (7th, Havas Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Paris) Communist Party Secretary-General Thorez recently gave an interview to the press, revealing the party's domestic and foreign policy platforms. He said, "After the Socialist Party comes to power, our party will support it with the most sincere attitude, but we do not intend to join the cabinet. Our party is the party of the working class, and we want to free the working class from the shackles of the capitalists. Before the goal of liberation is achieved, our party will do its best to uphold democracy, so that peace and freedom can be maintained."</p>
<p>Referring to foreign policy, Thorez advocated concluding various mutual assistance conventions similar to the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance convention to realize a collective security policy. In conclusion, he said, "The parties belonging to the Popular Front will organize executive committees throughout the country to engage in unified work to maintain unity. At this time, the French people have deep-seated prejudices against partisanship, and our party will shake them. Our party is willing to reach out to the Fire Cross League, which is organized by right-wing veteran soldiers, and the working class belonging to the Catholic Church, so that we can fight together, and our French prospects will be great."

<h3>French Financial Panic</h3>
<p>85 Million Yuan of Gold Shipped to the United States</p>
<p>(London) The foreign exchange market today continued to sell off large amounts of French francs until the Bank of France increased the interest rate from 5% to 6%, which slightly consoled merchants. Speculators only started to cover their positions at that time. The situation this afternoon was clearly quieter. Although the British Equalization Fund was still operating, it did not need to absorb a large number of French francs. After the French Minister of Finance announced that the government would not take special plans to control foreign exchange or prohibit the export of cash, the Bank of France restored the interest rate, so several major speculators thought that time could not be lost and that they should cover their positions to obtain current interest, so the market situation was slightly calmer. (6th, Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>(New York) According to financial experts here, the U.S. authorities may assist the French franc because the British and American Equalization Funds have cooperated before. However, everyone expects that the prospects for the franc will be difficult to stabilize until the new French cabinet clarifies the overall situation. It is reported that the gold shipped from Paris to New York yesterday totaled US$24.65 million, bringing the total to US$85.5 million. (6th, Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Bank of France today increased the discount rate from 5% to 6%. This is the government's first measure to protect the franc and prevent its depreciation. The bank had increased the discount rate from 3.5% to 5% on March 28. (6th, Guomin Telegraph)</p>
<h3>US-French Commercial Treaty Signed</h3>
<p>Trade Reciprocity to Take Effect Next Month</p>
<p>(Washington) The State Department announced today that the US-French reciprocal commercial treaty has been signed and will take effect on June 15. The treaty stipulates most-favored-nation treatment, including France increasing import quotas for American goods and the United States reducing import taxes on certain French items. The treaty is the result of negotiations that began a year ago and is the thirteenth commercial treaty signed by the United States, second in importance only to the US-Canada commercial treaty. It will not only be applied to France but also to French colonies, territories, and protectorates, with the exception of Morocco. The treaty can be terminated by either country giving six months' notice after January 1, 1937. (6th, Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Paris) The commercial treaty between the United States and France was signed in Washington yesterday and will take effect on June 15 of this year and expire on July 1 of next year. Its provisions have not yet been made public, but it is only known that the import tax rates on the goods with the most trade between the two countries, such as French wine and lace, and American fruits and automobiles, will be reduced. In addition, both sides will enjoy most-favored-nation treatment. This is the most important of the commercial treaties that the United States has signed with European countries since the United States Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act was promulgated in March 1934.

<h3>Algiers Chaotic and Broken</h3>
<p>Scattered Troops Attack French Embassy</p>
<p>Algiers After four days in a state of terror, there was still gunfire last night as armed gangs repeatedly attacked the city's shopping district. The area is in a state of utter disarray, as if after a major storm, with only burned, demolished, and looted shops remaining. The streets are littered with debris, and sometimes bodies can be seen. Since law and order has been lost, countless people are taking advantage of this opportunity to vent old grudges. It is estimated that a total of 500 Algerians have been killed in the riots. The British, French, German, and Italian embassies are all unscathed, and these seem to be the only buildings that have not been demolished. A French school was attacked and burned on the second day of the riots. (7th, Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>Algiers Several Algerian rebels recently attacked the French embassy with machine guns. The Italian military headquarters dispatched three tanks and 50 Ascari soldiers to suppress the attack, killing several rebels.

Last night, gunfire was still heard sporadically in various parts of the capital. Today, it has gradually calmed down. (6th, Havas Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Italy Will Not Establish a Puppet Monarch in Abyssinia</h3>
<p>But Will Appoint Several Puppet Governors</p>
<p>(Rome) Italy's decision on the future status of Abyssinia will not be announced before the League of Nations Council meeting on Monday, and it may not even be announced at the meeting. Italian officials are now keeping silent, only saying that they will respect the treaty rights of Britain and France. Italian officials did not expect the rapid occupation of Addis Ababa by the Italian army and the hasty escape of the Abyssinian Emperor. Many believe that the Abyssinian Emperor's escape is legally equivalent to abdication, so Abyssinia currently does not have a government that Italy can negotiate with. The Abyssinian representative in Geneva does not have credentials and cannot engage in negotiations. Therefore, Italy is now responsible for creating a new government. It is estimated that Abyssinia will be under military rule for a long time. It is not believed here that a puppet monarch will be established, but several governors may be established and given autonomous powers.

<p>(Rome) Fascist party leaders have determined a procedure for immediately developing Abyssinia. According to reliable sources, the first step is to appoint the current Italian military commander in Somalia, Graziani, as the military governor, the current commander of the Blackshirt Division in Africa, Starace, as the civil governor, and the current commander of the Italian army in Abyssinia, Badoglio, will be recalled and resume his position as chief of staff of the General Staff. Also, according to a famous banker who told reporters, the Italian government will soon borrow foreign debts from foreign countries to develop Abyssinia. (6th, Guomin Telegraph)</p>

<h3>British Labour Party Proposes in the House of Commons: Continuing Sanctions Against Italy</h3>
<p>Sharply Criticizing the Government for Indecision and Delay; Eden Declares Consideration of All Issues</p>
<p>(London) Today, the Labour Party in the House of Commons attacked the government's policies regarding the Italo-Abyssinian dispute and advocated for the continuation of economic and financial sanctions against Italy.</p>
<p>The debate today was initiated by Labour MP Dalton, who stated that the loss of credibility of the League of Nations and the entire collective security system was the responsibility of the British government. He argued that the British government had failed to fulfill the mandate given to it by the voters. On the one hand, the government failed to fulfill its obligations under the League of Nations Covenant, especially Article 16. On the other hand, it encouraged Abyssinia to resist Italy, leading the Abyssinians to believe that the League of Nations would surely provide assistance. However, it allowed Abyssinia to fend for itself without providing any aid. Moreover, not only did it not provide assistance, but it also permitted the continued supply of oil, essential to Italy, thus aiding Italy in destroying the Abyssinian government and profiting from the sale of oil by the Anglo-Iranian (i.e., Persian) Oil Company. Dalton also stated that this was not a matter between a defeated Abyssinia and a victorious Italy, but rather a matter between the entire League of Nations and a country that had been judged as an aggressor. The aggressor, using its overwhelmingly superior weapons, had violated its solemnly concluded treaties against the use of barbaric warfare and had achieved a significant victory under extremely unequal conditions. In this situation, there was no reason to lift the sanctions or recognize Italy's victory. Since sanctions were unanimously imposed on Italy by the League of Nations, the Labour Party advocated that economic and financial sanctions should continue to be enforced.</p>
<p>Liberal Party's Sinclair also stated that the issue between the League of Nations and Italy had not yet been resolved. Abyssinia's defeat at the hands of the aggressor was a great disgrace. Public opinion would not forgive the governments of the countries that created this disgrace, as the responsibility lies not only with the British government.</p>
<h3>Chamberlain States: Continuing Sanctions is Indeed Dangerous</h3>
<p>Former Foreign Secretary Austen Chamberlain stated that some people hold the view that Britain can accomplish something in the League of Nations, or enable the League of Nations to realize its effectiveness, only if Britain acknowledges that its contributions must lean towards a major power. To hold such a view is to live in a fool's paradise. In his opinion, once a major power has intentionally decided on an act of aggression, even the threat of economic sanctions cannot stop it. For this reason, in the early stages of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, he had calculated the cost and prepared to actively engage with other countries, even to the point of using force. However, now that the situation has changed, continuing sanctions at this time is not only dangerous but also an ineffective policy. Our hope of safeguarding the implementation of the rules of war through the actions of the League of Nations has now failed. However, human success comes from failure. We should make a genuine effort to bring Germany and others back into the League of Nations. The question of whether the League of Nations Covenant needs to be amended so that the Executive Council or the Assembly can act promptly in a dispute, or make decisions before a tragedy unfolds, should be considered. He believed that the government's view of establishing the League of Nations with such local conventions and guarantees was correct.</p>
<h3>Eden Explains: Why Not Close the Suez Canal</h3>
<p>Foreign Secretary Eden rose to respond, first reporting the news that Dr. Meile, a doctor from the British ambulance team in Addis Ababa, had been shot and seriously injured by a mob in the street and had died. He then spoke about the work of the Indian soldier guard of the British Embassy in Addis Ababa during the serious situation, stating that this guard had saved the lives of many foreigners, not only protecting approximately 2,000 people of 23 nationalities who had taken refuge in the British Embassy but also dispatching detachments to various places to rescue people from danger. All those who requested assistance were answered. The Abyssinian government had thanked the British government for the protection of its embassy by the Indian soldiers. The officer commanding this guard had indeed maintained the inherent highest honor of the Indian army. The Foreign Secretary then responded to the criticism of the government's policies, stating that the situation faced by Britain and other member states of the League of Nations was difficult and disappointing. Britain had consistently held a leading position in this dispute. The sales of British oil had decreased from 13 percent to 4 percent in 1935. Even if sales were completely stopped, what difference would it make to the outcome of this dispute? Among the governments in Geneva, only Britain openly advocated for an oil embargo. Britain was well aware that the weakness of sanctions was their inability to be immediately effective. The only immediately effective sanction would be to prevent Italy from using the Suez Canal. However, this action would inevitably involve military action and ultimately lead to war. Although the opposition party claimed to want to defend the League of Nations with cavalry, infantry, and artillery, in reality, they only wanted to support the League of Nations with threats, insults, and empty talk. It should be understood that Britain cannot close the canal with paper ships. If Britain did not advocate for military sanctions, it was because they were afraid of war and its ultimate consequences. Legally speaking, the canal cannot be closed without the action of the League of Nations. The opposition party should observe the attitude of many governments towards sanctions and be convinced that the League of Nations would certainly pass a resolution to close the canal.</p>
<h3>May Experience: The League of Nations Must Decide Its Future</h3>
<p>This was hopeless. In the future, it is clear that the League of Nations must proceed as an indispensable international organization in a new world. However, it is also clear that the governments and individual members of the League of Nations, having shouldered responsibility, must carefully consider the results obtained from the experience of the past three months, and the League of Nations must, as a whole, decide on the path of future action. The British government proposed to immediately undertake consideration of the various difficulties arising from this, and therefore will begin discussions with the governments of overseas autonomous territories. We must admit that the League of Nations' actions failed to prevent the outbreak of war before it occurred, nor did they stop the fighting after the war had begun. At most, the League of Nations only made war more difficult and more costly. Therefore, the world and the League of Nations are now faced with terrible problems. Can we foresee that the League of Nations can implement stricter actions than before in the future? Can member states bear greater risks than before? Can the actions of the League of Nations be more preventive than retaliatory? These are just some of the issues we face, and others will not be listed for now. Therefore, the future is difficult and not trivial, but the government will address it with a pragmatic spirit and constructive political skills. The Foreign Secretary did not wish to comment on the policies he would adopt at the League of Nations Executive Council meeting on Monday, stating that under these circumstances, his request for the House of Commons to have faith in him should not be considered unreasonable.</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary then spoke of the question of asking the German government about peace terms, saying that he hoped the British Ambassador to Germany would be able to submit this question to the German government tomorrow. The Foreign Secretary also responded to Lloyd George's question, saying that the government was well aware that some points had special relations with other governments, but the British government would now submit this question to Germany on its own responsibility. The government's goal in this negotiation remained the same as at the beginning of the negotiation, namely to turn a dangerous period into a period of opportunity. The unilateral cancellation of the Locarno Treaty had shaken the structure of European security. Our work now is to rebuild it. Britain has already made some contributions in the past and now intends to continue this work, feeling that there is nothing more urgent than this. We should not turn a blind eye to the current dangers. Military preparations are now being made everywhere in the world. In fact, several countries seem to disregard all other needs in their national economy and only focus on adding to their military strength. What Britain should do now is to: 1. Implement various peaceful methods to seek the resolution of outstanding issues; 2. Utilize various opportunities to enhance international harmony; 3. Implement the plan to rebuild military strength, as rebuilding military strength has now become an indispensable element in resolving various difficulties, because no matter what the future of the world may be, or what the future of the world organization may be, Britain has its own responsibility, and without military strength as its tool, it cannot effectively fulfill its responsibility in this armed world.</p>
<p>Henderson (son of former Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson) not only supported the proposal to continue sanctions but also advocated for the recall of the British Ambassador to Italy and the expulsion of Italy from the League of Nations.</p>
<h3>Churchill Says: We All Feel a Strange Shame</h3>
<p>Churchill spoke, sharply criticizing Prime Minister Baldwin, saying that Baldwin had said that he regarded the Italian occupation of Addis Ababa as a strange shame. We all feel a strange shame, but who caused it? Churchill also attacked Baldwin for not participating in the debate, saying that the person in power was not present to respond. He also said that this debate had greatly damaged British affairs, and that continuing the debate would inevitably cause discouragement.</p>
<p>Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Cranborne responded on behalf of the government, saying that the government had various reasons to be proud of its actions in the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. We sacrificed money and took great risks to uphold the principles we believed in, but because a system failed to be effective, the result was disappointment. We must clean up this position. This cleanup must be thorough to determine whether the League of Nations can be made effective.</p>

<h3>Italy Reiterates its Statement Respecting British and French Rights</h3>
<p>Britain Denies Negotiating with Italy; French Ambassador Meets with Mussolini</p>
<p>(Rome) Today, it was claimed in political circles that Italy will carefully respect the existing rights of the great powers in Abyssinia, such as Britain's interests in Lake Tana and France's rights to the Djibouti railway. As for declaring Abyssinia a protectorate of Italy or incorporating Abyssinia into Italian territory, this is not yet being discussed. Mussolini's remarks that Abyssinia belonged to Italy contained flexibility and could be interpreted as Abyssinia being a protectorate or as annexing Abyssinia, thus opening the door for diplomatic talks. It is heard that Mussolini now intends to gather reasonable people to hold a round table conference to agree on a solution based on reality, so as to preserve the interests of Britain in the Mediterranean, the Red Sea, and Lake Tana. Italy will never give up any land in Abyssinia. This can be seen from the remarks of Gada, published in the Italian newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia, who said that Mussolini's Roman Peace Declaration meant the complete annexation of Abyssinia by Italy. (Reuters, June 6)</p>
<p>(Rome) French Ambassador Chambrun met with Prime Minister Mussolini yesterday afternoon to discuss the new situation in Italo-Abyssinian relations. The meeting lasted one hour. According to French sources here, Chambrun's move was prompted by the upcoming meeting of the League of Nations Executive Council, and it was urgent to inquire about Italy's attitude so that the French diplomatic authorities could continue to mediate between Britain and Italy, making it easier to reach an understanding. As for the rumor that Chambrun had told Mussolini that the post-Abyssinian settlement must be handled under certain conditions before it could be accepted by France, otherwise France would follow the policies implemented by Britain, this was not confirmed. (Havas, June 7)</p>
<p>(London) It is rumored that Britain and France will jointly demand that Italy recognize the two countries' spheres of influence within Abyssinia. Those responsible have denied this statement, saying that the spheres of influence of Britain and France have already been clearly stipulated in the 1906 Anglo-French-Italian treaty and do not need to be reaffirmed. (Havas, June 6)</p>
<h3>Whether to Continue Sanctions Against Italy Becomes a Current Issue for the League of Nations</h3>
<p>League of Nations Executive Council to Meet on the 11th; Representatives from Various Countries Will Have Important Contacts</p>
<p>(London) British political circles have recently advocated adopting a "wait-and-see policy" on the Abyssinian issue, believing that Foreign Secretary Eden will certainly attend the League of Nations Executive Council meeting on the 11th of this month, but he should adopt the attitude of the majority of member states. As for the issue of sanctions against Italy, the British House of Commons had originally inclined towards a motion to lift them, but since Léon Blum, leader of the French Orthodox Socialist Party, gave an interview to the Daily Herald, supporting the principle of collective security, Major Attlee, leader of the Labour Party caucus in the British opposition House of Commons, immediately decided to go to Paris at the end of this week to discuss the international situation with the leaders of the French Socialist Party. In addition, the authorities of the Union of South Africa also advocated continuing sanctions, and the momentum of the opposition party in the House of Commons was boosted, and the atmosphere of relaxation was significantly dampened. (Havas, June 7)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Representatives from countries with no direct relationship to the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, namely Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands, and Spain, have decided to hold a preparatory meeting on May 9, two days before the League of Nations Executive Council meeting. League of Nations personnel believe that the representatives of these countries are likely to request the lifting of sanctions against Italy at that time and nominate representatives from Spain and Denmark to speak and defend their position in the Executive Council. Although the British government is unwilling to initiate this, it may support it if other countries propose it. In Switzerland, it is said that sanctions are meaningless unless they are used to prevent war or stop war, and there is no need to continue them. In addition, it is rumored that certain countries, especially the French representative, may propose a temporary suspension of the decision on the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. Britain may support this proposal, so as to wait until the new French cabinet is formed and gains the trust of the new Chamber of Deputies before negotiating and reaching a compromise on this issue. (Havas, June 7)</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Eden declared in the House of Commons today that Abyssinia has paid a total of US$126,144 in dues since joining the League of Nations. Labour MP Cox immediately questioned whether the Foreign Secretary thought Abyssinia had received its money's worth for the dues it had paid. Eden did not reply. Prime Minister Baldwin also declared in the House of Commons that Britain was unwilling to unilaterally prevent Italy from annexing Abyssinia. Britain advocates that the future policy towards Italy and Abyssinia should be jointly considered by the relevant countries at the League of Nations Executive Council meeting on Monday. (National Telegraph, June 6)</p>
<p>(London) Although official sources remain silent, it is generally known that the British government will still uphold the policy of collective security, and Britain will abide by whatever is decided at the League of Nations Executive Council meeting on the 11th of this month. Regarding the lifting of the current sanctions, Britain will act in accordance with the majority of member states and does not intend to initiate this proposal, but the cabinet sincerely hopes to lift them. The current problem lies in what procedure should be adopted to lift the sanctions in order to maintain the prestige of the League of Nations and Britain. It is heard that Foreign Secretary Eden may make a brief stop in Paris on his way to Geneva to discuss the new situation in the Italo-Abyssinian issue with French Foreign Minister Flandin. (Havas, June 6)</p>
<p>(London) According to the Daily Telegraph, the British government will propose the discussion of the reorganization of the League of Nations at the League of Nations General Assembly in September of this year. (Havas, June 7)</p>
<p>(Rome) Political figures claim that when the League of Nations Executive Council meets in Geneva on the 11th of this month, Italy will send a representative to attend, but there is no other solution to the Abyssinian issue other than annexation by Italy. If the League of Nations discusses this at that time, it should be rejected. Italy has already notified the relevant countries through diplomatic channels that the Abyssinian regime had already existed in name only, and now that the emperor and crown prince have left together, it has ceased to exist in both name and reality. How can it be considered an opponent? Britain is unlikely to object to this position, but it will demand that Italy not allow the number of black soldiers trained in Abyssinia in the future to exceed the actual needs. As for the issue of sanctions against Italy, Italy will hold separate talks with the relevant countries to suspend them, and they should be lifted soon. However, this may not be possible during this session of the Executive Council. (Havas, June 7)</p>
<h3>South African Prime Minister Advocates Continuing Sanctions</h3>
<p>Otherwise the League of Nations Cannot Survive</p>
<p>Cape Town The Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa, Hertzog, declared in Parliament today that if the League of Nations fulfills its responsibility, it must maintain sanctions against Italy. If necessary, it must be extended for many years. If this is done, Italy will eventually be forced to yield. If the League of Nations does not continue sanctions against Italy, the League of Nations cannot survive, because no country would want to be a member of the League of Nations, which has proven to be a broken object. Minister of Defense Pirow asked what the situation would be if a large black army arose in North Africa. The development of Abyssinia has made this discovery at least 25 years closer to the present day. The illusory fears of the past have now become a real possibility. Minister of Justice General Smuts said that in this world encountering terrible sights and dangers, my intention is that there is only one straightforward thing to do, which is to loyally support the League of Nations, until Italy is forced to establish a peace within the League of Nations framework. Even if sanctions against Italy cannot be increased, at least the existing basis must be maintained. If the members of the League of Nations have the courage to do this, the League of Nations can still be preserved. Today's choice is not between this League of Nations and another League of Nations, but between this League of Nations and chaos and destruction. (Reuters, June 6)</p>

Sir Phipps had added explanations to the content of the question table and stated that Britain attached particular importance to certain items. (Havas, June 7)</p>

<p>Thessaloniki, Greece After the conclusion of the Standing Political Conference of the Balkan Entente countries, Greek Prime Minister Metaxas recently made a statement here, saying that if Bulgaria re-equips itself without the consent of the relevant countries, the improvement of the current situation in the Balkan Peninsula will inevitably be hindered. As for Turkey's request to restore armament in the Dardanelles and Bosporus Straits, once it is decided to implement it, the demilitarization of the Greek islands of Lesbos and Samothrace will be abolished accordingly. In addition, the Standing Political Conference of the Balkan Entente countries has agreed on various political and military measures to safeguard the interests of each country in the event of threats. As for the content of these measures, Prime Minister Metaxas did not disclose it, only saying that the Balkan Entente Pact is defensive in nature, not offensive. (Havas, June 7)</p>

<h3>Ma Yinchu's Remarks</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Ma Yinchu said that he agreed in principle with the development of foreign trade and the unified control of the tea industry, but it should be centrally managed by the state, allowing merchants to participate in shares as much as possible. The key point is the inspection of grades. Ma also said that regarding the financial problems in extraordinary times, he still advocated adopting income tax. Regarding the inheritance tax, land value tax, and land appreciation tax advocated by various parties, he believed that inheritance tax was only applicable to the development of education funds, and land value tax, etc., would be uncollectible because land prices would inevitably fall during extraordinary times. Land taxes on farmers should not be increased to add to their suffering. Profit tax should be adopted in extraordinary times. Various countries have used it successfully. During the World War, European and American merchants became rich quickly due to the war, and the government seized the opportunity to collect profit tax, which was extremely effective.

<p>The local production and sales taxes, and all excessive and miscellaneous taxes on tea, should be stopped within a prescribed period in accordance with the clear orders of the National Government in June of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934) to abolish excessive and miscellaneous taxes.

<h3>American Invention: Night-Flying Carrier Pigeons</h3>
<p>— Jiang Renjie</p>
<p>The year 1936 has already begun, and what the world often hears is the call for a Second World War, and what newspapers read are the figures of the great powers' armaments. However, one thing is certain, that is, if the Second World War does indeed come, the relationship between science and war will become even closer, and strategy will become more scientific and mechanized. Now, scientists in various countries are already immersed in research. The night-flying carrier pigeons invented by the U.S. Army Signal Corps is a good example.</p>
<p>Military carrier pigeons all fly during the day. If you want to convey military information at night, ordinary military carrier pigeons are useless. After ten years of effort and research, the U.S. Army Signal Corps has actually invented a kind of night-flying carrier pigeon that can safely deliver military information to headquarters or other destinations at a speed of one mile per minute in the darkest night, or on a day with heavy rain, heavy snow, or foggy weather. This group of night flyers is not only the latest invention of the U.S. Army in terms of combat communications, but also a most amazing scientific invention.</p>
<p>Last summer, signal corps stationed at various posts in the United States conducted many experiments, which proved that these carrier pigeons are not only more reliable in night flights but also more stable compared with other types of carrier pigeons. Regardless of whether they are released from airplanes flying at sea or from airplanes flying at high altitudes on land, they can all fly back safely. Usually, they are released from broad plains, dense forests, or dense cities, and they will never get lost or separated.</p>
<p>For example, not long ago, in the Hawaiian Islands, a U.S. territory, the U.S. Army and Navy conducted a combat exercise. At that time, many bomber planes had flown 30 miles from the land, and it was at night. The pilots then tried to release a batch of these newly invented carrier pigeons. This group of birds actually safely carried the information back to their nests 35 minutes later. In actual warfare, the importance of this confidential military information brought back can naturally be imagined. As for the land tests, after being released in dense cities on the American continent, these carrier pigeons can also safely return from a distance of 10 to 15 miles.</p>
<p>Some people must doubt that this is the world of wireless radio, where military information can be transmitted by wireless radio everywhere, and the manufacture of wireless radio is improving day by day, becoming more and more refined. Hasn't the U.S. Army Signal Corps wasted money, spent years of time, and wasted so much effort to invent these carrier pigeons, isn't that a waste of time and extremely foolish? In fact, many military experts are now convinced that in future large-scale military operations, relying on wireless radio for communication will be useless. For example, according to reports, the Italian wireless radio inventor Marconi has already invented a very strong radio column that can emit extremely strong power to airplanes to destroy the electrical machinery on the planes and prevent them from flying. In the midst of war between two countries, both sides of the attack and defense will definitely try to gain an advantage by surprise, and all kinds of unexpected scientific methods will be realized. At this moment, machines that radiate radio columns to interfere with the radio waves emitted by wireless radio, or to deafen wireless radio receivers, have already been invented. This kind of radio column machine can be used at any time in a stronger wireless radio station, or in a large power plant. It can also be used in mobile marching troops. Therefore, when actual war occurs, the effectiveness of wireless radio communication depends entirely on the location of the battlefield, and generally speaking, its effectiveness will inevitably be reduced. That is why you have to rely on carrier pigeons. Because no matter how strong the radio waves that disrupt wireless radio communication are, they have absolutely no effect on carrier pigeons.</p>
<p>This batch of night-flying carrier pigeons was successfully trained in the Monmouth Army Base area of ​​New Jersey, USA. The managing expert is Ross. According to Ross, the way carrier pigeons distinguish direction and choose flight routes is very similar to the way airplane pilots navigate airplanes, but it is mysterious as to how they are able to do so. Ross is a world authority on raising and training pigeons. He said, "It is generally believed that carrier pigeons have a homing instinct. The so-called homing instinct is most easily misunderstood. In fact, it is stronger and more important than instinct. I can't think of a better name, so I might as well call it aerial flying spirituality. For example, a pilot has many sophisticated instruments installed in front of him that can tell his plane where to fly and in what direction. As for these carrier pigeons, it is as if they have this kind of instrument installed in their brains, telling them how to fly even more brilliantly than instruments. Because they are not flying blindly, but navigating in the air. When they encounter storms and rain, they can avoid the storm and rain areas to the left or right and fly around them, and then resume their original route forward. However, why they can fly back to their destination, I can't explain, I'm afraid no one knows. However, it is probably related to their ears. Because if their ears are blocked, they cannot fly back, which is really a strange thing." According to Mr. Ross, carrier pigeons are not only very important in wartime, but also useful in peacetime. He believes that passenger and mail-carrying aircraft should carry one or two carrier pigeons on each flight to send messages for help in case the aircraft encounters danger, so that rescue can be obtained immediately.</p>
<p>Carrier pigeons have high intelligence and great courage. When they encounter eagles, they know how to avoid them, and they fly faster than eagles. They can also endure long flights. In the United States, the longest record created by a carrier pigeon is from Texas in the southwest to Maine in the northeast, a total of 2,150 miles, with an average speed of 700 miles per day. This was created by daytime-flying carrier pigeons. If the newly invented night-flying carrier pigeons are used, of course it will be even more than that.</p>
<p>The process of inventing and training these night flyers is extremely interesting and unique. The initial experiments began as early as ten years ago. In 1925, the Army Signal Corps stationed in the Monmouth base area specially selected ten pairs of the most ingenious and intelligent species from several species of experienced daytime carrier pigeons. During the day, these ten pairs of pigeons were always confined in cages. When dusk approached, these twenty birds were taken to a place not far from their original residence and released to allow them to try to fly back to their original place. This method of training continued, and gradually the time was changed later and the distance from the original place was slowly increased. Finally, they were able to fly back from a mile away in the dark.</p>
<p>These ten pairs of trained carrier pigeons were used as the basis to allow them to reproduce. Each generation of pigeons was trained. By the eighth generation of pigeons, they actually had the characteristic of flying at night from birth. With considerable training, they became the current night-flying carrier pigeons. Training begins on the eighteenth day after the pigeons hatch from the eggs. As dusk approaches, the young birds are released from the cage, allowing them to stand on the perching boards to observe their original environment and become familiar with the geographical situation. After a few days, they began to practice flying. In the dim twilight, they are taken to a place 200 yards away and released for their first return flight. Gradually, after a week, these birds' nocturnal flying characteristics become apparent, and they can fly back from a mile away in the dark. From then on, the distance is increased by a quarter of a mile every night. Later, it was increased to a dozen miles or even dozens of miles. After the training is successful, they are divided into three categories according to the most reliable flying distance at night: 5-mile pigeons, 10-mile pigeons, or 15-mile pigeons, for application.</p>
<p>The flying speed of night-flying carrier pigeons is also not much different from the speed of daytime-flying carrier pigeons. Depending on the climate and wind direction, it is usually 50 to 55 miles per hour. The letter bags they carry now have also been improved. They are not tied to the pigeon's legs, but are tied to the chest in a streamlined shape, which greatly reduces the wind resistance during flight. Therefore, each carrier pigeon can carry three ounces of mail. This is really a great help for military affairs.</p>

<h3>Shantou Kakuta Incident: Japanese Consul Suddenly Makes Demands</h3>
<p>The two sides are still in negotiations</p>
<p>Shantou Dispatch: Since the Japanese Kakuta died violently in Shantou, the Japanese initially insisted that it was done by the Chinese and raised serious protests. After our side investigated the situation and protested, the Japanese could not find any excuse after several negotiations. Although this case has not been concluded, it has long since subsided. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the 2nd of this month, Wada, the commander of the Japanese Mako Port Fortress, arrived in Shantou on the "Akikaze" warship. The Japanese consul in Shantou, Harada, first sent a formal letter to the Shantou Municipal Government on the afternoon of the 1st, making demands regarding the Kakuta case and setting a deadline of 2 PM on the 2nd for a satisfactory response. His demands included tens of thousands of yuan in compensation for Kakuta's death, and other conditions, and he declared that if a satisfactory response was not received by the deadline, he would take independent action. The Shantou Municipal Government immediately telegraphed the province for instructions and received a reply, instructing them to resolve the matter properly. The Municipal Government then sent Councilor Huang to meet with the Japanese consul on the afternoon of the 2nd, replying to his demands that they needed to discuss them in detail to find a solution, and at the same time, secretly ordered all parties to be on alert. The people of Shantou could not help but feel anxious. Later, coincidentally, the commander of the Japanese Tenth Fleet, Nishioka Shigetai, arrived in Shantou, and also met with Mayor Chen at the Municipal Government at 8 PM on the 2nd, and more rumors spread in the market. Later, it was heard that Nishioka was willing to mediate in this case in a personal capacity, and the matter seemed to ease temporarily, so the people in the market also calmed down slightly. As for the resolution of this case, it is reported that the two sides are still in negotiations. (May 3rd)</p>
<h3>Compatriots Anonymously Stow Away to Siam: Over Eight Hundred People Imprisoned</h3>
<p>Siamese-Chinese Chamber of Commerce Replies to Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission; Unscrupulous Merchants Plan to Prevent Imprisoned Overseas Chinese from Returning Home; Shantou Municipal Government Summons Innkeepers</p>
<p>Shantou Dispatch: After a certain ship traveling between Shantou and Siam colluded with unscrupulous merchants to transport a large number of overseas Chinese stowaways to Siam and were apprehended, appeals were made from all sides to rescue them and to severely punish the culprits who arranged the stowaways. However, three months have passed since the incident, and the so-called culprits who arranged the stowaways have not been caught, nor have the imprisoned people received adequate rescue. Therefore, this case has gradually tended to subside. Now, the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Siam has listed the names, ages, native places, etc. of the Chinese overseas Chinese who were imprisoned in Siam and sent them to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. It is estimated that a total of more than 800 people were apprehended before and after. As for how the stowaways were arranged, it was mostly done by a certain inn, but no reply was received. Now that the date of release is approaching, the association, in addition to requesting the Siamese authorities to allow a reduction in the residence tax to be paid when each imprisoned person is released, has also sent letters to the relatives and friends of the imprisoned people in Siam to inquire whether they can raise the money to pay the tax on their behalf to ensure their residence, or the association will provide a certain amount of travel expenses to send them back to China. However, it is heard that all those who arranged the stowaways are carrying out activities to encourage the imprisoned overseas Chinese to pay a certain amount of tax on their release in order to prevent them from returning home, in the hope that this case can be resolved invisibly.</p>
<p>The Shantou Municipal Government received a report from the Siamese Chinese General Chamber of Commerce to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, stating that the association had investigated in Siam and found that as many as 800 Chinese overseas Chinese had been arrested and imprisoned by the Siamese government for more than three months (sentenced to 100 days of hard labor), and decided that if they were released after the term of imprisonment and no one in Siam would guarantee them and pay their personal tax on their behalf, they would be deported. More than 30 passengers who were escorted back from Jiangsu and Sharina last month. The Municipal Government immediately summoned them once to thoroughly investigate how they were deceived, and which inns and people handled the arrangements, so as to investigate them one by one, so that the handlers could return the original funds and compensate for the losses. Although the Municipal Government has obtained information, it has not yet determined how to punish them because the matter is too important. Recently, the Overseas Chinese Mutual Aid Society received telegrams from the Malaysian Chaozhou Association Federation, the Singapore Tongde Newspaper Society, the Singapore Teochew Association, the Dutch Sampoerna Teochew Association, and the Goat Mouth Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, requesting that they be immediately forwarded to the government, advocating for the thorough and strict handling of unscrupulous merchants and the officials responsible for checking the outgoing passengers when the ship sailed. 　Another passenger who was escorted back, Chen Yichun, complained to the Overseas Chinese Mutual Aid Society, stating that he was lured and defrauded of 95 silver dollars by the Nancheng Yingji Inn and innkeeper Chen Yayue on the day he was deceived. After Nancheng Yingji received the money, they promised to arrange transportation to and from and a safe landing, gave him a receipt for "tea money", sent him to a certain ship, and ordered him to hide in the bottom of the hold, declaring that if he could not land and was escorted back, the original money would be returned. Now he has suffered hardship in vain and has been escorted back to Shantou, and requested that the Municipal Government summon Chen Yayue and others from Nancheng Yingji to recover the original money. The Municipal Government recently summoned both parties to court based on this. Chen Yayue, the innkeeper of Nancheng Yingji, directly confessed that he had arranged for passengers to go to Siam. The Municipal Government transferred the case to the Shantou Court for handling on the grounds that Nancheng Inn had the crime of deliberately deceiving overseas Chinese to seek money. (May 2nd)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province: Ling Shan Earthquake Still Ongoing</h3>
<p>County Residents Deeply Concerned About the Entire County Submerging, Request Dispatch of Geological Experts for Investigation</p>
<p>Guangzhou dispatch: A severe earthquake occurred in Lingshan County, southern Guangdong Province. The extent of the disaster was reported previously. According to a recent telegram from the county, tremors are still being felt in various parts of the county. Considering the earthquake disasters since April 1st, residents of the county have witnessed many villages being leveled or the ground sinking into deep pools. They are deeply concerned that the entire county may be submerged. County Magistrate Song Depei has specially submitted a petition to the Civil Affairs Department of the Provincial Government, requesting immediate relief and the dispatch of experts to the county to investigate the geology, clarify the situation, and reassure the people. The original petition states: "The Lingshan Earthquake Disaster Area Refugee Relief Committee General Affairs Section, represented by Ye Fuqing and others, has submitted a report. Now, we have received the proposal from committee member Chen Buxiu on April 20th of this year, stating: 'We have found that since the first day of this month, our county has suddenly suffered from an earthquake disaster, and the entire county has been affected. The second and third districts have been particularly severely affected. The areas with drastic changes have become rubble fields, with numerous casualties, a heartbreaking sight. Currently, the disaster-stricken people are everywhere, crying out in distress, and the rumbling sounds still occur several times a day. Land subsidence and house collapses are still frequently heard. Therefore, people are panicked, feeling like a lonely city at sunset, precarious and uneasy. In this extraordinary situation, everything is at a standstill. Although we are fortunate to have generous and righteous gentlemen who are actively raising funds and providing relief, the disaster continues unabated, and the tremors are frequent. It is difficult to predict how this will end. Without a scientific analysis, it will be impossible to dispel rumors. Moreover, as the spring plowing season is approaching, if rural residents cannot be quickly reassured and return to their work, the losses will be even more unimaginable. Based on the above reasons, we hereby submit this proposal, earnestly requesting that the county government be instructed to telegraph the Guangdong Provincial Government, urging them to promptly dispatch geological experts to the county to conduct on-site investigations to determine the causes and consequences of the disaster, to calm the people's hearts, and to discuss a comprehensive relief plan, so that the people may rely on it. This is feasible, and we respectfully request a public decision.' This is approved and should be implemented. We hereby prepare this document and submit it to your office for review and approval for forwarding, to fulfill our public duty." We have found that a severe earthquake occurred in our county on [date], and there have been collapses of houses and deaths in the second and third districts, relatively many. The disaster is particularly severe. We have already reported this to you by telegram for your review and have personally led surgeons to provide relief, resettle refugees, and convene meetings with people from all walks of life to establish the Lingshan County Earthquake Disaster Area Refugee Relief Committee to investigate the disaster and discuss relief matters. As of today, the second and third districts are still experiencing earthquakes from time to time, and the disaster shows no sign of ending. The people are frightened, which is indeed the actual situation. According to the report, in addition to reporting the disaster of collapsed houses and dead livestock after the investigation is completed in the future, we hereby telegraph to request that you review and approve the transfer of the report to the Provincial Government to promptly dispatch geological experts to the county for investigation to clarify the truth and reassure the people. This is what we earnestly pray for. Respectfully, Song Depei, County Magistrate of Lingshan." (May 3rd)</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Writings on Rural Hubei</h3>
<p>(Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Cheng Jun)</p>
<p>Lewd Operas and Shrines in Daye</p>
<p>On the afternoon of April 3rd, I traveled from Yangxin to Daye by car. The distance between Yangxin and Daye is ninety li. I passed through Ditianqiao, Baishapu, and Xiaojipu, all of which belong to Yangxin. I got off the bus at the foot of Hailuo Mountain, which is only a lake away from the Daye county seat and still within Yangxin territory. The lake is called Jin Lake, which is formed by the convergence of spring water from the surrounding mountains. I hired a small boat and crossed it. The spring water was green, the setting sun cast shadows on the trees, and I leisurely floated in the middle of the lake, enjoying the scenery. The Daye county seat is surrounded by water on three sides, with no city walls and no soldiers checking. I went ashore and checked into the Daye Hotel. In recent days, I have traveled all over the disaster area. All I have seen are dilapidated houses with broken tiles and crumbling walls, or disaster victims with haggard faces. It is extremely troublesome to have soldiers checking luggage. Now I can finally relax a little. The streets of the county seat are long and stretch for three or four li. In the year 19 [of the Republic of China], it was captured by the Red Bandits three times. The commerce is extremely sluggish now. The county government's original office was burned down by the bandits and razed to the ground. It is now located in the Jin Lake Academy in the city center, which is very cramped. When I arrived at the county seat, the new and old county magistrates had just handed over. The people missed the old magistrate, Mr. Wu, quite a bit, presumably because he had good policies for the people. After the new magistrate, Mr. Cao, took office, he immediately went to Beijing for training, and the political affairs were handled by Secretary Yuan. I went to visit, waited for two hours, but the gatekeeper would not let me in. Later, I learned that he was out drinking and was acting like a typical official. I smiled and dismissed it and did not go again.</p>
<p>The area of the county is not as large as Yangxin. It was originally divided into ten districts, but now it has been reorganized into four district offices. There are many interconnected lakes and rivers, and the mountains undulate. Huangshigang and Shihuiyao are famous commercial and industrial areas. Most of the land in each village is used for growing crops rather than paddy fields. The rice produced can only feed the people for four months, and sweet potatoes can feed them for eight months, the same as in Yangxin. Fertile land is worth 100 yuan per mu, but now it has been reduced to 30 yuan. Barren land is only worth a few yuan. From the autumn of the 18th year [of the Republic of China] to the summer of the 21st year [of the Republic of China], the period of the most severe banditry, the entire county was communized. The fifth and sixth districts suffered the most, with approximately over ten thousand people killed by the bandits. Many houses were also destroyed, but the extent of destruction in the rural areas was not as severe as in Yangxin. The main force of the Red Bandits was wiped out by Chen Jicheng's troops last autumn. The search and suppression of scattered bandits was mostly carried out by armed anti-communist volunteer teams, as the people are strong and able to defend themselves. Among the villagers, there was a man named Zuo Hongde, who had fought fiercely with the bandits four or five hundred times and captured hundreds of bandit rifles. Currently, Longjiao Mountain in Yangxin, Nantantou and Huangmao Village in Echeng, and Huarushu, Longquanyang, Sanjiashan, and Luobeikou on the border between Yangxin and Daye are still harassed by scattered bandits. However, more than a hundred blockhouses have been built throughout the county, making it difficult for them to invade the interior.</p>
<p>In the 23rd and 24th years [of the Republic of China], the county suffered from repeated floods and droughts. The people's burden was heavy, and their lives were difficult. The land tax used to be as high as ten yuan per mu, but now it is calculated based on the price of unprocessed rice. One dan of rice is equivalent to two dan of land, and the tax is nine yuan and four fen per dan of rice, which is equivalent to five jiao per mu at the current price. The cost of Baojia [local self-governance system] depends on the number of Lianbao [joint defense unit] holding rifles and volunteer teams. Without a rifle-holding volunteer team, it costs no more than five yuan per month per Bao. With a rifle-holding volunteer team, it often costs more than ten yuan. The people feel most pained by the persistent abuses of the grain scribes, as the power to collect grain is still in the hands of the grain scribes. When collecting grain, they freely send people to the countryside to squeeze as much as possible, and the amount of excess collection often exceeds twice the amount that should be paid.</p>
<p>The people are naturally simple and litigious, often filing frivolous lawsuits. The so-called frivolous lawsuits are lawsuits filed even without a reason, as if they came out of nowhere. Since the opening of the coal and iron mines, the simple customs have changed to extravagance and licentiousness due to the convenience of transportation. The number of vagrants has been increasing day by day. Opium and gambling are rampant, and the government cannot prohibit them. The Huaguxi opera is the most corrupting of customs. Currently, in the new fourth district, two Huaguxi opera troupes are performing at the same time, and they have not stopped yet. Not only are local men and women flocking to it, but even the district chief is going to watch the opera and give "dacai" [tips]. (Giving "dacai" is like reporting the addition of an official, but without its formality. The female performers on the stage publicly call the person giving "dacai" "dear father," and he must give them money. It is extremely ugly.) District Chief Yi Yanfan is a victim of the May 30th incident in Yangxin. When the opera is being performed, gamblers are rampant. On stage, they are joking and laughing, while off stage, they are yelling and gambling. The district is adjacent to the bandit areas of Huarushu and Bajiaoting. Not only is it corrupting customs, but it is also likely to affect public security. Although the county magistrate has issued a strict ban, it is still regarded as a mere formality, probably because they have something to rely on.</p>
<p>There are also the so-called shrines, which are the greatest hidden worry in society. The people of Daye are extremely superstitious, and local ruffians take advantage of this psychology to set up shrines everywhere in the name of treating diseases and praying for blessings, secretly recruiting followers. People follow them as if going to market. Their potential power has now spread throughout the territory. The largest of the shrines are the "Western Heaven Different Gate," the "Big Knife Society," the "Tongshan Society," the "Doumu Altar," and the "Luo Zhenren Altar." The so-called "Western Heaven Different Gate" resembles the Golden Light Sect in the east. The "Big Knife Society" and others are remnants of the White Lotus Sect, the Red Lantern Society, and the Boxer Rebellion. Each type has titles such as "Pen Holder," "Great Teacher," "Great Guide," and "Assistant." The "Pen Holder" is said to have a god attached to his body and has the highest position and the greatest power. The "Great Teacher" and "Great Guide" make decisions, and the "Assistant" also makes decisions. All those below the Teacher are responsible for preaching and guiding. The followers use a red circle with a double circle inside as a symbol, write the Heavenly Fortune year, and do not recognize the Republic of China's official calendar. It is heard that these strange organizations are unified under the so-called "Ten Thousand Sects Society" and receive its guidance. People only blindly follow out of superstition, but those in charge are not only aiming to accumulate wealth and bewilder the masses. Therefore, those who know the inside story cannot help but feel chilled.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Representatives of North China Yarn Mills Go to Wuxi</h3>
<p>The seven major yarn mills in North China, Henan, Shanxi and other provinces, including Yufeng, have formed the North China Yarn Mill Association to improve the industry. They have sent Yan Qingxiang, Zai Wenxin, Liu Chijun and other twenty people as representatives to form a delegation to go south for inspection. They first went to Shanghai to visit various yarn mills, and then came to Suzhou from Shanghai on the 6th to visit Suzhou Lun Yarn Mill, Huasheng Paper Plate Factory and other major factories. The Wuxian Industrial Branch held a welcome meeting and a public banquet. The delegation left Suzhou for Wuxi yesterday morning (7th) to visit.</p>
<h3>Rent Riot Comes to an End</h3>
<p>In the rural areas of Suzhou, such as Chefang and Xietang, farmers have repeatedly launched major rent riots, citing poor harvests. Police teams and villagers clashed, but fortunately, the authorities sent teams to suppress them, and the riot came to an end. However, this riot was caused by the authorities sending personnel to collect rent. Although the riot has subsided, rent collection is still in its early stages, and it seems that it cannot be simply ended with suppression. Therefore, rent collection committee members Zhang Qianli and others submitted four methods to the county government for approval: 1. Tenant farmers must pay their rent arrears at the designated grain depot by May 21st. After the deadline, the county will send security teams to collect rent from door to door. 2. The price discount will be calculated as seven yuan before the 7th, seven yuan and fifteen fen before the 14th, and seven yuan and thirty fen before the 21st. After the deadline, it will be calculated as seven yuan and forty-five fen. 3. Those who pay within the 21st will receive an additional discount. 4. Those who are truly poor will have their village and township Baojia leaders prove it and issue a debt note for future payment. The above methods have been approved by County Magistrate Deng, and the grain depot owners have no objections. They will be implemented immediately, and the farmers in each village also consider them fair. Therefore, they have been paying rent in succession, and there should be no other problems. County Magistrate Deng, in response to the farmers in Lu Tomb and Yangshang Villages gathering to resist rent, yesterday (7th) specially instructed the Public Security Bureau to quickly investigate and secretly arrest them, and instructed the police district in charge to handle it carefully.</p>
<h3>Extension of Suzhou-Jiaxing Railway Opening</h3>
<p>After the completion of the Suzhou-Jiaxing Railway Jinlu project, test runs have been carried out twice with excellent results. Currently, they are rushing to paint the station houses along the route, which is expected to be completed within a month. As for the official opening date, it was originally scheduled for July 1st, but according to news from transportation circles, it will be postponed to July 15th for the official opening to transport goods. The opening to passenger trains will still take time, as the equipment and procedures are not yet ready. It is heard that the railway police affairs will be handled concurrently by the South Station of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, and the train affairs will be handled concurrently by the Hangzhou Station of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway.</p>
<h3>Murder Case Due to Adultery Occurs Outside Changmen</h3>
<p>Cao Rengen, who lives outside the South Gate of Wuxi, recently learned that his wife, Cao Zhang, and her lover, Zhao Baomai, were hiding in Suzhou. He immediately came to Suzhou with his friend Zhang Yifengshan to inquire with Zhang Yisan at 41 Damalu outside Changmen. Zhang Yisan kept Cao Rengen at his home on the evening of the 6th. On the one hand, he went out with Zhang Fengshan under the pretext of looking for Cao Zhang and Zhao Yinbao. Zhang Yisan induced Zhang Fengshan to a remote place north of the Main Lord Temple near the train station. Zhao Yinbao suddenly flashed out from the roadside, along with two other accomplices. Zhao Yinbao grabbed Zhang Yanshan, pushed him to the ground, and untied a black belt, cutting and strangling Zhang Fengshan's neck, intending to strangle Zhang Fengshan to death. At that time, Zhang Fengshan fainted. Zhao Yinbao and others thought that he was dead and immediately dispersed. Fortunately, Zhang Fengshan's fate was not to die. The black belt suddenly broke, and he gradually woke up. It was already 2 a.m. Because he could not walk, he crawled to the vicinity of Guangji Bridge on Shantang Street and reported to the police officer on duty. The police officer took him to the police district in charge and sent police to Zhang Yisan's home. Because Zhang Yisan was not there, his wife was interrogated. It was learned that Zhang Yisan, Cao Zhang, and others were staying at the Renhe Public Inn in Yangjiayuanzi Lane. The police went to the Renhe Public Inn and arrested Zhang Yisan, Cao Zhang, and others, along with the tea boy Huang Zhaojin. On the evening of the 6th, an accomplice named Jin Xiaocheng was also arrested and taken to the branch station. On the 7th, they were sent to the Public Security Bureau. After Zhang, the section chief, interrogated them, he transferred them to the local court for strict handling. The Public Security Bureau sent police to strictly arrest Zhao Yinbao and bring him to justice. However, Cao Rengen suddenly disappeared, and the authorities are investigating whether he was murdered.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Mr. Etman Comes to Wuxi to Inspect Labor</h3>
<p>Mr. Etman, Overseas Director of the International Labor Bureau, came to China to investigate labor conditions. At 8:34 p.m. on the 6th, accompanied by his wife and Cheng Haifeng, Director of the International Labor China Branch, he arrived in Wuxi from Nanjing. Gao Jian, President of the Provincial Education Institute of Wuxi, had been notified in advance by the Ministry of Industry and specially accompanied local business leaders Rong Desheng, Cheng Jingtang, Hua Shaochun and others to meet him at the station. Mr. Etman, accompanied by Mr. Cheng Haifeng, visited the Shenxin Third Factory and the Maoxin First Factory. In the afternoon, he visited the Qingfeng Yarn Factory and the Luxin Textile Dyeing Factory and will visit Huaxin Yongtai and other silk factories today to investigate labor conditions. He will stay for about three or four days and then go to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Special Commissioner's Office Plans to Establish a Factory for Opium Addicts</h3>
<p>Zang Qifang, the Special Commissioner of the Wuxi District Administrative Inspectorate, has repeatedly received reports from various counties stating that during this period of strict drug prohibition, after the expiration of the general reporting period, the number of opium offenders has increased sharply, and it is almost impossible to accommodate those who should be sent to drug rehabilitation centers. They requested that the detention centers be expanded to accommodate opium offenders. The Special Commissioner believes that expanding the detention centers would be very costly, and it would be difficult to find suitable housing. He intends to convert the detention centers into factories for opium addicts, so that the offenders can have the opportunity to learn skills and make a living independently in the future. He has prepared a plan and submitted it to the Civil Affairs Department for approval. The factory site is planned to be established in Wuxian, divided into weaving, sewing, dyeing, textile, daily necessities, and chemical crafts departments. All opium addicts under the age of 50 must be admitted to the factory to learn skills for a limited period of six months. At the same time, they will be given academic and military training. Each period will have a limit of 500 people. Those with excellent skills will be given prizes to encourage them. It is heard that the initial funding is estimated to be over 31,000 yuan, and the annual recurring expenses after opening will be over 30,000 yuan. Once approved by the Civil Affairs Department, preparations will begin immediately.</p>
<h3>Robbery and Assault Case Occurs in the Sixth District</h3>
<p>Chen Zongshun, a resident of Nanchen Lane, Group 5, Jia 8, Maijiu Lane Village, Sixth District of this county, is 56 years old. He has been a farmer for generations and is still able to make a living. Last year's autumn harvest was abundant, and he accumulated hundreds of dan of grain. This spring, the price of rice rose, so he sold his stored grain and obtained over a thousand yuan, which he stored at home, attracting the covetous eyes of bandits. At midnight the other day, about thirty bandits suddenly broke into his house. They spoke the local dialect and each held flashlights, guns, and iron rulers. They broke down the door and tied up all the members of Zongshun's family with ropes, threatening them not to make a sound. They then ransacked the house and searched through all the boxes and cabinets. All the rice money was stolen. Zongshun and his wife were also severely beaten. Yesterday, they reported the robbery to the district office and requested that it be forwarded to the county government to investigate and recover the stolen goods.</p>
<h3>Yinjiang Qingyang Red Pill Case Sent to the Province for Interrogation</h3>
<p>Huang Gonghe Cocoon Firm in Qingyang Town, Sixth District, secretly established a red pill manufacturing organization the year before last. It was uncovered by Wu Bingjun, the former head of the Second Public Security Branch. However, because of bribery in Wuxi, the case was dismissed. This case involves many people and has not been closed. Recently, someone reported it to the Zhenjiang Garrison Headquarters. Yesterday (6th), County Magistrate Yuan ordered the police to go to Qingyang and arrest Xu Zukun, Jiang Hong, Zhu Hongji, and Zang Xihong and take them to the county. They will be sent to the Garrison Headquarters for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Haimen: Songji Port Shipping Boat Robbed</h3>
<p>In recent years, this county has been unsettled, and robberies have suddenly become rampant. Songji Port and a corner of Songhai Road are particularly frequented by bandits. Passengers going back and forth are often robbed, and boat accidents occur from time to time. Therefore, travelers regard this port as a dangerous place. The other morning, during a small flood, the passengers on the wheel could not enter the port after unloading their sculls, so they floated in the river. They beckoned the shipping boats to ferry the passengers and luggage in batches. Unexpectedly, as the ship was loading passengers and starting the engine, a bandit boat suddenly came from afar, approached the shipping boat, and more than a dozen burly men jumped out, holding sharp weapons and threatening them not to make a sound. All passengers were robbed by bandits. They took the Beijing Special Trust</p>
<h3>The "Food" Problem in Beiping</h3>
<p>— Special Dispatch from Beiping</p>
<p>According to recent statistics, the population of Beiping is 1,574,582. This does not include the 3,122 foreigners and those living in the embassy area of the Dongjiaominxiang. Among Chinese cities, aside from Shanghai, this is probably the most populous. The "food" problem for such a large number of people is, of course, a matter worthy of attention. The situation in several aspects is outlined below.</p>
<p>From the perspective of daily necessities for family life, general prices in Beiping are actually a bit cheaper than elsewhere. For example, regarding flour, the current market price for Fuxing brand is 3 yuan 6 jiao 6 fen per bag, Pao Che brand is 3 yuan 5 jiao 6 fen per bag, Tianjin rice is 1 jiao 05 fen per jin, Saigon rice is 1 jiao per jin, and Wuxi rice is 13 yuan 4 jiao per shi. These cannot be considered cheap, but the prices of the following raw materials, which have a closer relationship with the lives of ordinary citizens, are relatively cheaper. For example, millet is 6 fen 5 li per jin, corn flour (i.e., maize flour) is 4 fen 5 li per jin, millet flour is 4 fen 8 li per jin, beef is 1 jiao 7 fen per jin, mutton is 2 jiao 4 fen per jin, pork is 2 jiao per jin, spinach is 12 "mei" per jin, rapeseed is 40 "mei" per jin, cilantro is 48 "mei" per jin, chives are 28 "mei" per jin, celery is 32 "mei" per jin, and small radishes are 6 "mei" per bunch. (In Beiping, large copper coins are used, each called "two mei." "Twelve mei" means six large copper coins, which, at the current market price, is equivalent to one small copper coin plus one-third in the Beijing-Shanghai area). Such cheap prices are not available in other cities.</p>
<p>For general upper-middle-class families, the main food sources are rice, flour, beef, mutton, pork, and various vegetables. For lower-class families, the main food sources are millet, millet flour, corn flour, and various vegetables. In addition, for coal, oil, salt, and other items needed for cooking, according to market prices, raw coal is 3 jiao 3 fen per 100 jin, hard coal is 4 jiao 5 fen per 100 jin, sesame oil (i.e., sesame seed oil) is 8 "mei" per liang, peanut oil is 7 "mei" per liang, and salt is 80 "mei" per jin.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, upper-middle-class families spend at least half as much on "food" as in the Beijing-Shanghai area. Spending 200 to 100 yuan a month in this regard is considered top-tier, while 80 to 50 yuan is considered middle-tier (small families with fewer than five people spend even less). As for lower-class families, one mao per person per day is enough to eat.</p>
<p>The economic situation for common people's food is so bad that people who can't even organize a family have to live this "commoner" life. This "commoner" life means having a meal or not, earning more and eating more, earning less and eating less, and not earning and not eating. Eating one meal a day is common. When they earn money, they immediately buy ready-made food on the street, eat to gain strength, and then go back to earning. (Their entire lives consist of only these two things.) The main foods are sesame cakes, fried dough sticks (similar to youtiao in the South), fried tofu, steamed buns, wotou (made from corn flour), roasted sweet potatoes, etc. If they want soup, there's wonton for three large "mei" a bowl or douzhi for five large "mei" a bowl. Cutting some sauce (pork, donkey, beef, etc.) for ten large "mei" to make a side dish is considered a very rich meal.</p>
<p>Usually, a person spends about twenty "mei" per meal. Spending more than one mao per meal is rare for them. People living this kind of life are mostly rickshaw pullers, children who pick up trash, and old women who exchange lamp wicks (i.e., matches) for scrap paper. Therefore, when you are surrounded by more than a dozen pairs of rickshaw pullers with longing eyes, crying to you, "Sir, Sir, I haven't eaten anything all day," or when you hand a pile of old newspapers to the old women who exchange lamp wicks, and they tremble their withered hands, only willing to give you a box of red-headed matches, while pleadingly muttering, "Sir, please give me enough to buy another wotou," these are all true situations and not just business tactics.</p>
<p>Restaurants: The number of restaurants in Beiping is probably unimaginable to people living in the South. It's not an exaggeration to describe the situation as "lined up in rows." A large population is the first reason. Everyone lives a relaxed life, so they have leisure to be particular about this, which is the second reason. There are not many entertainment options, so they have to treat eating out as a form of entertainment, which is the third reason.</p>
<p>Classified, they can be roughly divided into four categories: Western restaurants, banquet restaurants, snack restaurants, and food shops. Eating Western food is not common in Beiping, and there are only eleven restaurants. The most famous is the Jieying Western Restaurant on Langfang Toutiao. Usually, you can get a meal for 1.5 to 2.8 yuan. Banquet restaurants are divided into Shandong restaurants, Huaiyang restaurants, Guizhou restaurants, Henan restaurants, Guangdong restaurants, Sichuan restaurants, and mutton restaurants, etc. Each of these has its own characteristics and famous representative restaurants, such as Dongxinglou for Shandong cuisine, Lumingchun for Huaiyang cuisine, Xiqianyang for Guizhou cuisine, Donglaishun for mutton cuisine, Rongyuan for Henan cuisine, Donghualou for Guangdong cuisine, and Dalu Chun for Sichuan cuisine.</p>
<p>The number of snack restaurants is also countless. They have the flavor of banquet restaurants but are not as formal. A Beiping banquet costs about ten yuan, which is considered average. In a snack restaurant, drinking with two or three people costs only three or four yuan. As for food shops, they serve single dishes or provide board. A dish and a soup usually cost one to two mao. Board costs seven to nine yuan per month. Most of the patrons of these kinds of food shops are students. Because there are many students in Beiping, business is mostly very prosperous.</p>
<p>Special Foods: In addition, famous foods in Beiping, such as Peking roast duck from Quanjude and Bianyifang, roasted beef from the Wang family in Aner Hutong, sauced beef from Jushengzhai, sauced mutton from Yueshengqi, white stewed meat from Shaguoju, fried dough pieces from Mujiazhai, and fried triangles from Douchu, are famous foods that anyone who has ever "stayed" in Beiping, whether from the North or South, must try.</p>
<p>In summary, whether rich or poor, the food problem in Beiping is generally more comfortable and cheaper than elsewhere. A friend who used to do propaganda work once told me, "Beiping people are the most difficult people in China to be influenced by propaganda." Therefore, Beiping society is also relatively stagnant. However, in recent years, it has become poorer day by day. It's not that Beiping people can't endure. When they become so poor that even the minimum "commoner life" can't be maintained, perhaps this stagnant society will change a bit.</p>

<h3>The Party-State Flag Manufacturing and Sales Bureau Invited Guests from All Walks of Life Yesterday</h3>
<p>More Than a Thousand People, Including Mayor Wu, Attended</p>
<p>The Party-State Flag Manufacturing and Sales Bureau, in order to allow people from all walks of life to understand the complete manufacturing methods and procedures of the Party-State flag, specially invited Mayor Wu and guests from all walks of life to visit its factory and held a welcoming meeting yesterday starting at 9:00 AM. Those who were invited arrived in succession, from morning to evening, in an endless stream. Details are noted below:</p>
<p>Visits to Various Offices</p>
<p>Yesterday, the bureau set up a temporary reception area at Jixian Li on Nanjing Road and hired several group buses to wait on Tianjin Road. Guests from all walks of life arrived successively from 9:00 AM, and staff from the bureau were on-site to greet them and assist them onto the buses. They disembarked at the Shanghai Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory at Gao Lang Bridge on Huade Road. A welcoming arch was erected in front of the factory, with bright and splendid Party-State flags hanging above. Committee members of the bureau Zhang Zilian, Zhang Rongchu, Chi Tingxian, Yu Zhendong, Shen Chuchen, Chen Zhibei, and Zhang Shenzhi of the Shanghai Textile Printing and Dyeing Company, along with all staff, were on hand to greet them and guide them to various places for a visit.</p>
<p>Guest Signatures</p>
<p>Yesterday, those who visited included Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Secretary Zhang Guoren of the Publicity Department of the Central Party Headquarters, Director Peng Gechen, Section Chiefs Hong Ruizhao and Gao Yinzu, Wang Peng of the Songhu Garrison Command, Lin Kanghou of the National Federation of Commerce, Zhu Qinglan of the Zhenwu Committee, Wang Xiaolai of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Yao Fangren of the International Trade Bureau, Li Dachao of the Air Force Association, Xu Xiaochu of the Taxpayer's Association, Zhang Yichen of the Citizens' Federation, Gui Yanfang of the Local Association, and Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, and representatives from all walks of life, totaling more than a thousand people.</p>
<p>Tea Reception</p>
<p>At 10:30 AM, a welcoming meeting was held in the auditorium of the Shanghai Textile Printing and Dyeing Company, with tea and refreshments prepared to entertain guests from all walks of life. Mayor Wu delivered a speech in person, and representatives from all walks of life also made speeches. The film department of the Central Party Headquarters sent Mr. Wang Yang to film the event. When the meeting began, the factory blew its whistle in respect. The meeting ended at 11:30 AM.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>After performing the formalities, Chairman Zhang Zilian first delivered a welcoming speech, stating briefly that the Party-State flag is a symbol representing the Party-State, and the central and local leaders have always paid attention to it. Since the establishment of our bureau under orders, with the guidance and supervision of the Central Party Headquarters and the Ministry of Interior, and the enthusiastic promotion of compatriots from all walks of life, the flag system has become increasingly unified, which has greatly benefited the awakening of national consciousness and the promotion of national spirit. Our bureau manufactures products according to the methods prescribed by the Central Government, with three characteristics: 1. Never fading; 2. Whole piece of fabric; 3. Domestic raw materials. After your visit today, you will be able to understand the manufacturing process. In the future, we hope that you will provide guidance to promote the national emblem and revitalize the national spirit.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang's Report</p>
<p>Then, Committee Member of the Bureau and Manager of Shanghai Textile Printing and Dyeing Company Zhang Rongchu reported, stating briefly that the textile printing and dyeing industry in our country is very immature. The integration of these four aspects is rarely seen domestically. I have been striving for years to promote domestic goods and reduce leakages, and with the assistance of various parties, the scale is initially established. However, our country's industry is under the oppression of foreign goods, and business is difficult. Although our factory is somewhat comforting in terms of equipment and layout, we have experienced many hardships and difficulties. Manufacturing the Party-State flag is in line with the central government's and Party-State leaders' intention to rectify the flag system and with the encouragement of my friend Zhang Zilian, to serve the Party-State, not to make a profit. Today, your presence allows you to understand the manufacturing process of our factory, from spinning to weaving to printing to dyeing, from cotton to the completion of the Party-State flag and various products. We hope that you, gentlemen, will not hesitate to provide guidance and promote the national emblem and promote domestic goods, so that Rongchu can carry out his original intention and strive to maintain the national industry and the livelihood of workers. This is what I sincerely hope for.</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech</p>
<p>Then, Mayor Wu delivered a speech, briefly stating that today, the Party-State Flag Manufacturing and Sales Bureau welcomes guests from all walks of life to visit the manufacturing content of the Party-State flag and has earnestly provided hospitality. I am both grateful for the opportunity to visit and offer my thanks. The Party-State flag declares the truth of the country and symbolizes the nation. Therefore, the manufacturing of the Party-State flag must be taken seriously. The central government has given serious consideration to the manufacturing of the Party-State flag. In order to achieve uniformity and consistency, the Party-State Flag Manufacturing and Sales Bureau was specially organized to be in charge of the manufacturing and sales of the Party-State flag. Since the Party-State flag represents a country and embodies the spirit of a nation, the uniformity of the Party-State flag proves the completeness of a country in its organization, and the tidiness of the Party-State flag proves that a nation is disciplined and orderly. Now that the Party-State flag has a dedicated agency in charge of its manufacturing, it should not be difficult to achieve uniformity and tidiness. The Party-State flag is extremely important in the national significance, which should be known to all of us. However, in order to show our actions, we should have respect for the Party-State flag. Our respect for the Party-State flag is our respect for the country and the nation. This is what we must have a clear understanding of. If Chinese people can show respect for the Party-State flag, foreigners can also show respect for our country's Party-State flag. Therefore, in the future, we hope to work hard to ensure that every household should have a Party-State flag and that everyone should show respect for the Party-State flag. This represents the concentration of national importance and the fullness of patriotic spirit. In order to complete this mission, not only should the Party-State Flag Manufacturing and Sales Bureau work hard, but also people from all walks of life should work together to achieve the uniformity and tidiness of the Party-State flag and the goal of everyone having one and everyone respecting it.</p>
<p>Speeches from All Walks of Life</p>
<p>Then, Wang Xiaolai spoke, stating briefly that he was grateful for the bureau's diligent hospitality. Today, the factory manufactures uniform and tidy Party-State flags from the process of self-spinning, self-weaving, self-printing, and self-dyeing. After the visit, I felt something about national affairs. I believe that if our 400 million compatriots can all have the spirit of "self-love, love of country, love of people" and "self-rescue, saving the country, saving people" and work hard to move forward, then our country and nation will be able to coexist in glory with this bright and splendid Party-State flag. Then, Lin Kanghou spoke, stating briefly that the meeting place today is full of Party-State flags, with bright colors and tidy styles, which is inspiring. The Party-State flag is the facade of the Republic of China. If the facade is decorated with spirit and color, it can arouse the love and affection of the general public. Therefore, I hope that the people of the country will also pay attention to this facade of the Republic of China, and I especially hope that the Party-State Flag Manufacturing and Sales Bureau will work harder and not fail the central government's heavy responsibility for manufacturing. Li Dachao and others also gave speeches. The chairman's reply was omitted for brevity. Mayor Wu, Zhu Qinglan, Zhang Guoren, Hong Ruizhao, Li Dachao, Gui Yanfang, Pan Yangyao, and others also inscribed poems to leave as souvenirs.</p>
<p>Manufacturing Content</p>
<p>Guests arrived at the factory successively and were guided to visit various departments of the factory by staff assigned by the bureau. The factory is divided into five departments: 1. Spinning Department: spins cotton into cotton yarn, with 52 spinning wheels and 15,000 spindles. 2. Weaving Department: weaves cotton yarn into cloth, with 800 looms. 3. Bleaching Department: bleaches the cloth, with 6 bleaching machines. 4. Dyeing Department: dyes the bleached cloth with a base color first. 5. Printing Department: formally prints the colors of the Party-State flag on the dyed cloth, then washes it with steam. The raw materials used by the factory, except for pigments, are all domestic goods. There are more than 1,300 workers. The daily output can reach 200,000 flags for sizes one to three, 80,000 flags for size four, and more than 10,000 flags for sizes five and six. Flags of sizes seven, eight, nine, and ten are produced by a reasonable combination of machines and manual labor, with about 1,000 flags per day. The machines used are all the latest models from various countries, so production is faster and management is easier. Each Party-State flag, from cotton, must go through 46 procedures in its manufacturing process, which shows that success in everything is not easy.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Industry and Commerce Preparing to Deal with Smuggling in North China</h3>
<p>General Federation of Industry to Hold Meeting Today to Discuss Telegram from Yarn Mill Federation Requesting Authorities to Suppress Smuggling</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Federation of Industry believes that smuggling in North China is rampant, and there are obviously traitors instigating it.

<h3>Shanghai Import Industry Already Affected by North China Smuggling</h3>
<p>Report by the Correspondent of the English-Language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury</p>
<p>According to the English-Language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury, translated by a foreign news agency, a correspondent for the Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury investigated the impact of smuggling on the Shanghai market. The investigation found that the number of smuggled goods entering the concession market from both North and South China is increasing daily. Due to the competition from smuggled goods, reputable local merchants are gradually losing their customers in other areas. Transactions in several regions have even completely ceased. When the correspondent interviewed various merchants to inquire about the current state of smuggling, their managers and staff appeared extremely resentful. Their replies to the correspondent were generally as follows: "We have no statistics, so we cannot clearly tell you the quantity of smuggled goods. However, we can state definitively that this smuggling is dealing a tremendous blow to legitimate importers." When the correspondent inquired about the true impact on Shanghai's import industry, it was reported that the goods currently entering the concession market in the largest quantities are various high-value items that are easy to conceal, such as rayon fabrics, cosmetics, and medicinal materials. Other bulky goods, such as canned foods, paper, cloth, and manufactured goods in boxes, are flowing into the interior in large quantities, causing Shanghai's merchants to completely lose their original transactions. Furthermore, many products from major companies are being transported from Tianjin to Shanghai via railways, leading to a phenomenon of oversupply in the market. Last week, at least 500 boxes of American-branded condensed milk were smuggled into Shanghai, with purchase prices far lower than local selling prices. There are now widespread rumors that large quantities of white sugar are also being shipped in the same way. However, the exact quantity is currently unknown. Because tariffs on certain goods, such as sugar and silk, are very high, smugglers are focusing their activities on these items. However, local importers believe that as large quantities of smuggled goods enter the market, creating an oversupply of inventory, it is only a matter of time before this illegal business faces the same difficulties as legitimate trade. In fact, the only import businesses currently unaffected by smuggled goods are heavy machinery, steel, iron, and certain specialty items ordered directly from merchants here. Foreign manufacturers have not suffered significant damage, as many commercial nations other than Japan also ship goods to free ports. The hardest hit are local importers and the Chinese Customs. Importers believe that if the government could reduce tariffs to 5% ad valorem, revenue would likely increase compared to today. A representative of a foreign trading company stated, "If customs can lower its tariffs, Japan's tactics can be defeated in ten minutes." He added that those who blame the Japanese authorities for condoning their nationals' involvement in smuggling should instead focus on the Chinese Customs, as they are responsible for raising tariffs. Another foreign merchant expressed the opinion that in May 1933, the import tax on certain luxury goods, such as diamonds, was reduced, while the tax rate on several necessities, such as hardware and food, was increased, which was inappropriate. The current rampant smuggling is also related to this. According to a clothing merchant who spoke to the correspondent, women's clothing tailors in the French Concession have received a considerable number of smuggled goods in the past two to three months, with a large quantity expected soon. Silk that sold for two yuan per yard last winter has now fallen to 75 cents per yard, with a continued price decrease expected. A merchant also reported, "Shanghai used to be the central hub for stocking imports. However, the situation has changed dramatically. Ship crews traveling between Shanghai, Hong Kong, and other ports are smuggling large quantities of stocking, profiting greatly, more than their salaries. The import tax on stockings in Shanghai is 100%. When these ship crews arrive in Shanghai, they hide the stockings in their clothes, and no one can detect them upon landing." A local merchant recently returned from traveling to various ports in North and Central China and stated that smuggled goods, aided by the opening of the Canton-Hankow Railway, are likely to spread throughout the country. The manager of a large general merchandise trading company stated that their business has been affected in two ways. First, their Tianjin branch. Previously, general merchandise stores in Tianjin would purchase goods from Shanghai. However, since the start of smuggling, all business has completely disappeared. Second, certain goods sold by their company are, in fact, being smuggled to various regions. There are recent rumors that several import merchants in Shanghai may also order their goods through the Dalian Free Port. However, before taking such action, they are willing to fight against the high tariffs here. However, they know that this effort is unlikely to be successful. A paper merchant stated that they currently have no transactions in North China. The reason why the local market has not yet been affected is that large quantities of paper are too bulky and difficult to smuggle. However, it is only a matter of time before they are affected. A foreign merchant engaged in the packing business recently returned from Tianjin and reported that all commercial activity in North China has come to a standstill. In order to sell their goods, merchants are reducing prices and extending credit for one month. Several large Chinese stores have gone bankrupt due to the market conditions. In the first three months of this year, goods imported into China decreased by 51 million yuan compared to the same period last year. The largest decrease was in Tianjin, from 21,800,000 yuan to 11,900,000 yuan. In recent months, large quantities of raw silk and rayon have been smuggled into Shanghai. The exact amount is still unknown. The smuggling methods are quite ingenious, often beyond expectations. From January to April last year, the import value of raw silk and silk fabrics was 2,300,000 yuan. During the same period this year, the total has fallen to 1,500,000 yuan. The decline after April will be even more alarming. In the first three months of 1935, China's imports of silk products from Italy were worth 600,000 gold standard yuan. During the same period this year, it has fallen to below 300,000 gold standard yuan. Goods exported from Japan have also fallen from 473,000 gold standard yuan to 270,000 gold standard yuan. According to Sir Shalita's estimates, the tax revenue lost by China at the Meiguan customs checkpoint is about 25% to 30%. In reality, the amount of goods smuggled into China is 15% to 20% higher than previously recorded. Customs officials are well aware that to prevent smuggling on a large scale, only two methods can be adopted: 1. Reduce tariffs to make smuggling less attractive. 2. Increase anti-smuggling efforts to make smuggling extremely difficult. The main imports susceptible to smuggling are diamonds, gems, jewelry, shark fins, bird's nests, ginseng, white sugar, rayon, woolen fabrics, and silk fabrics. Customs officials are making great efforts to prevent smuggling. Anti-smuggling personnel are stationed along the coast for inspection, and patrol ships are constantly patrolling the sea.</p>

<h3>20th International Labour Conference Chinese Labour Representatives' Proposals</h3>
<p>Request the Formulation of a Convention on Equal Treatment of Chinese and Foreign Workers, Establishment of a Mutual Aid System, and Compliance with Labour Laws; Suggest the Conference Assist China in Prohibiting Opium and Narcotics</p>
<p>Dagon News Agency: The 20th International Labour Conference is scheduled to be held in Geneva on June 4th. The labour representative appointed by the Chinese government, Zhu Xuefan, and the employer representative, Sun Fangyu, have departed to attend. The proposals from the Chinese labour side for this Conference total four, all translated by Mr. Zhu into various languages and submitted to the Conference for discussion, striving for their realization. The full text is excerpted below:</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of equal treatment for domestic and foreign workers, request the Conference to decide to include it on the agenda of the most recent Conference and to formulate a public draft as soon as possible. (Explanation) Regarding the issue of equal treatment for domestic and foreign workers, the 17th International Labour Conference in 1933 passed the following resolution: "Recognizing the importance of the protection afforded to workers employed abroad by Part XIII of the Treaty of Versailles and other problem sections of peace treaties, and for the full implementation of the recommendation 'Concerning Reciprocity of Treatment of Foreign Workers and Their Families and Domestic Workers' passed by the First International Labour Conference held in Washington in 1919," "Recognizing that the 12th International Labour Conference has requested the Governing Body of the International Labour Office to note the necessity of including this issue on the agenda of the most recent International Labour Conference," "Recognizing that the world has long suffered from financial and economic panic, and the treatment of workers residing abroad violates the principles of equality and justice, with many workers being forced to leave their country of employment, leading to displacement and hardship," "And recognizing that the Migration Committee of the International Labour Office has begun to study the issue of equal treatment, the 17th International Labour Conference specifically requests the Governing Body to consider the necessity of implementing existing research, and to include this issue on the agenda of the most recent International Labour Conference, in order that this issue may be formulated into a public convention as soon as possible. The importance of this issue and the urgency of its resolution have been acknowledged by the Conference. The severity of the current global economic panic is more profound than when the above resolution was passed. Foreign workers residing in various countries suffer discrimination and exclusion from the host government, making survival impossible, violating principles of fairness and humanity. The repeated occurrence of such injustices poses a major crisis to human peace. Request the Conference to decide to include the resolution passed by the 17th Conference on the agenda of the most recent International Labour Conference, and to formulate a public draft to alleviate the legal and social oppression suffered by overseas workers. Request the International Labour Conference to instruct the Governing Body to contact the governments of all member states to establish an international mutual aid system for labour employment services, to alleviate unemployment. (Explanation) Currently, public employment service systems seem to be universally implemented in various countries, and there are also many employment service agencies organized by private groups. However, all are limited to within the country. There is no establishment of such joint organizations or liaison systems internationally. Based on past experience, labour supply and demand situations vary greatly between countries. Often, one country lacks certain talents and cannot find them, while another country suffers from an excess of certain talents and struggles to place them. Due to geographical relations, information is isolated, and both parties cannot mutually satisfy their needs. There is also an illegal labour recruitment system, where privately operated recruitment agencies exploit workers' ignorance and sign extremely harsh contracts with workers, forcing them to engage in inhumane work or restricting their freedom. Countless workers are harmed by this system. If an international mutual aid system for labour employment services could be established, or a permanent international labour employment service agency could be established, regularly handling international employment service information, investigation, statistics, contact, guidance, and other work, the above shortcomings and malpractices could be prevented, which would have a very significant effect on resolving the unemployment problem. The global unemployment panic is becoming increasingly serious, and this issue deserves consideration. Regarding the implementation methods of this system, please first seek opinions from all members of the Council before making a decision. Request the Conference to recommend that the governments of all member states allow all factories established in China to comply with Chinese labour laws and allow Chinese workers to enjoy the right to assembly and association. (Explanation) The purpose of labour legislation is to protect the safety and happiness of workers, entirely to maintain human peace. The Chinese government has attached great importance to labour legislation in recent years. Laws such as the "Factory Law," "Trade Union Law," and "Factory Inspection Law" have been promulgated and implemented, with significant results. However, within the concessions, they still cannot be implemented due to the lack of understanding from the concession authorities. In addition, what Chinese workers feel most painfully is especially regarding workers within the concessions, they are not allowed to organize trade unions. The problem is most serious. Employers dismiss workers who join trade unions. Concession authorities even forcibly disband trade unions. The major strike at the Shanghai Power Company in 1933 was caused by the employer not allowing workers to organize a trade union. As a result, 54 people responsible for initiating the organization of the trade union were dismissed. This is one example. This policy violates the principles of fairness and justice. The right to assembly and association is recognized by modern democratic countries. Article 2 of the general principles in Part II of the International Labour Organization's constitution stipulates that "Workers and employers should have equal rights to assembly and association, only limited by the purpose not violating the law." Article 1 of the Chinese Trade Union Law also stipulates that "Industrial workers with 100 or more people, and professional workers with 50 or more people, may organize trade unions." The granting of this right is based on the principle of human equality. The exercise of rights does not exceed the scope permitted by law and is absolutely not restricted or infringed by any force. Chinese workers can no longer tolerate such measures by the concession authorities. We appeal to all of you at the Conference to pay close attention to the seriousness of this issue and to find a way to eliminate it. At the same time, please request the Conference to decide to recommend that the concession authorities and the governments of relevant member states change this policy as soon as possible. Otherwise, we dare not imagine the development of the future." Request the Conference to recommend that each relevant member state assist the Chinese government in prohibiting opium and potent narcotics. (Explanation) The Chinese government has shown great determination to prohibit opium and potent narcotics, such as red pills, heroin, and morphine, adopting a six-year plan to completely eradicate opium from 1935 to 1940. For drug prohibition, a two-year plan has been adopted, and extremely strict laws have been promulgated. Anyone who plants, manufactures, sells, or transports opium and narcotics will be sentenced to death. Numerous drug rehabilitation institutions have been established, enforcing compulsory detoxification. Excellent results have been achieved since its implementation. However, what China considers most difficult is that a small number of foreigners do not comply with Chinese laws and use special status or methods to transport opium and narcotics to China, such as certain nationals in North China. This behaviour violates international anti-smoking obligations and endangers friendly relations between countries. Please request the Conference to recommend that all member states earnestly caution their nationals and assist the Chinese government in preventing the occurrence of such incidents. Although this matter does not directly fall under the responsibilities of the International Labour Conference, the majority of victims are workers, and the Conference cannot sit idly by. Furthermore, regarding the issue of overseas Chinese workers smoking opium, the International Labour Office has discussed it in the report of the French labour representative, Mr. Shih Wu, and has submitted the report to this Conference, hoping that the Conference will take necessary and effective measures on this matter.</p>
<h3>Minister Kong and Others Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Kong Xiangxi and Li Shizeng took the overnight express train from Beijing yesterday and arrived in Shanghai this morning.</p>
<h3>After Overcoming the Difficulties at the End of April, Silver Pawnshops Continue to Extend Loans</h3>
<p>The Leading Investment and Support of Industry by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, Increase of Market Chips, and Increasingly Lively Finance</p>
<p>Since the silver pawnshop industry in this city safely overcame the difficulties at the end of April, it now has sufficient funds to continue extending loans and rescue the market. In addition to handling rediscounts, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications are jointly leading investment in industry. Therefore, the financial situation is quite lively. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Continuing to Extend Loans</p>
<p>The silver pawnshop industry in this city temporarily tightened lending during the period at the end of April to replenish reserves. Now that the difficulties have been safely overcome, and the demand for loans from various industrial and commercial sectors is quite urgent, a decision has been made to utilize the sufficient funds after the end of April to continue handling loans for various sectors. Therefore, various sectors and banks have been busy handling loan procedures in recent days. However, the number of loans is mostly small and dispersed, in order to widely rescue the market. The Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications loan committee continues to organize interbank lending.</p>
<p>Investing in Industry</p>
<p>In recent years, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications have invested significantly in industrial loans, such as cotton yarn, flour, and chemical factories. Investment in agriculture has also reached more than 10 million yuan. Recently, commercial banks have been somewhat indifferent to industrial and commercial investment due to the impact of economic downturn. Now, a decision has been made to jointly lead investment to rescue industry, and two principles have been decided: 1. Major investments will no longer be made in investment projects already held by commercial banks to avoid conflicts. Commercial banks will continue to handle these projects themselves. 2. For projects that commercial banks are unwilling or afraid to invest in, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications will provide loans as much as possible to maintain existing businesses and promote emerging businesses.</p>
<p>Lively Finance</p>
<p>The finance in this city is becoming increasingly lively as the silver pawnshop industry continues to handle interbank lending, indirectly rescuing various sectors. Since the bank note acceptance house has been handling interbank note acceptance, its business has developed quite well. The Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications are accepting requests from the bank note acceptance house to handle rediscounts, which is increasing the amount of liquid funds. The turnover of various sectors is more convenient, and the financial market is becoming more lively.</p>
<h3>New Life Movement Inspection Group Dare... To Leave Shanghai for Zhejiang Today</h3>
<p>According to reports, the impression of this trip is quite good, and the Public Security Bureau has expressed satisfaction.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Xiang, the deputy head of the New Life Movement Inspection Group, went to Beijing the day before yesterday to handle important matters. Mr. Zhang Yuchong, an attache of the group, went to Hangzhou to arrange accommodation. Both have returned to Shanghai last night. They are scheduled to lead the group headquarters and the second team of inspectors this afternoon to Hangzhou for inspection and to promote the New Life Movement in Zhejiang Province. The third team of inspectors is also scheduled to depart in groups this afternoon to work in Songjiang, Jinshan, Jiashan, Haining, Jiaxing, and other counties. The first team of inspectors is also scheduled to take a sea vessel today and depart in groups to work in Ningbo, Zhenhai, Fenghua, Zhuji, Xiaoshan, and other areas. They are scheduled to return to Shanghai after a month, then travel to Jiangbei, Jinpu Railway, Longhai Railway, and other places along the line to promote the New Life Movement. According to the person in charge of the group who spoke to the National Society reporter before leaving, the group has visited various organizations, groups, schools, and factories in Shanghai since arriving last month. They are generally satisfied with the state of the New Life Movement. They acknowledge that the Public Security Bureau has been able to establish a New Life Movement section independently to promote the New Life Movement. Recently, they have also organized a female employee labour service group as an example for various agencies. Such enthusiasm for promoting the New Life Movement is rare. The Public Security Bureau is the most diligent in promoting the New Life Movement in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Yacdi Visited Various Factories Yesterday</h3>
<p>He attended a banquet hosted by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce in the evening and a banquet hosted by Mayor Wu this afternoon.</p>
<p>Yacdi, a member of the Philippine Congress and chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, visited local national goods factories yesterday afternoon accompanied by Zhang Nanyin of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. He went to the Kang Yuan Can Factory, the Mayar Silk Weaving Factory, the Great China Rubber Factory, the Apper Electric Appliance Factory, and other organizations. The responsible persons of each company guided the visit of each section. At 8:00 pm that evening, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce hosted a banquet at the International Hotel to welcome Yacdi, and invited leaders from all walks of life to accompany him. More than 20 people attended, including Yu Zuoting, Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Du Yuesheng, Zhou Jue, Hu Xiyuan, and Zhu Boyun. Yu Zuoting, the chairman, gave a welcome speech, and Yacdi thanked him. The banquet ended at around 10:00 pm. It is also learned that Mayor Wu Tiecheng will host a banquet at his private residence this afternoon to welcome Mr. Yacdi. It is also learned that Mr. Yacdi is scheduled to take the overnight express train to Beijing that evening to visit the authorities in the central government.</p>
<h3>Our National Overseas Chinese Affairs Problem (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Qigang's Radio Speech</p>
<p>The Form of Overseas Chinese Affairs Administration　I have already briefly discussed the definition of overseas Chinese affairs and the understanding of the problem of emigration among Chinese people. Now, I want to explain to everyone the form of our national overseas Chinese affairs administration and the key to the survival of overseas Chinese. Judging from the political history of our country, overseas Chinese affairs administration is really a newly created concept in recent times. As I said before, our country first had the fact of "people emigrating," and then the organization of overseas Chinese affairs agencies. This cause and effect is the opposite of that of other countries. In the past, our so-called overseas Chinese affairs really did not involve practical actions in administration. Because overseas Chinese affairs agencies only had a vague form in history, without specific administrative powers and functions. Looking at the historical facts of our national overseas Chinese affairs agencies, more than fifty years before the founding of the Republic of China, that is, in the first year of Xianfeng, the Qing government established Overseas Inquiry Bureaus in places such as Guangzhou, Tianjin, Xiamen, and Ningbo. At that time, it was an agency to ban and control the export of Chinese laborers. In the seventh year of the Republic of China, the Beijing government established the Overseas Labor Affairs Bureau under the State Council. In the eleventh year of the Republic of China, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau was established, and later changed to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Yuan. Its content and reality were completely empty institutions, used to restrain overseas Chinese and appease revolutionary elements, with absolutely no so-called overseas Chinese affairs policy. In the twelfth year of the Republic of China, Mr. Sun Yat-sen established the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau under the Revolutionary Government Headquarters. From the fifteenth to the seventeenth years of the Republic of China, the National Government established the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee. In the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee was changed to be under the jurisdiction of the Central Party Headquarters. All these organizations were agencies to deal with the personnel issues of overseas Chinese and to promote the revolution. It was not until the twentieth year of the Republic of China that the Legislative Yuan revised the Organic Law of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee, changing the overseas Chinese affairs agency to be under the Executive Yuan of the National Government. In the twenty-first year of the Republic of China, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee was reorganized and established, finally forming the prototype of an overseas Chinese affairs administration agency. However, compared with the structure of overseas Chinese affairs administration agencies in other countries, it is far from satisfactory. Even compared with the overseas Chinese affairs administration organization that we actually need, there is still a long way to go. For example: 　The internal organization is not sound, with the appearance of having a large head and a small tail; 　There is a lack of systematic tools in administration. Overseas Chinese affairs bureaus in domestic ports are not yet complete, and consuls in various foreign countries still cannot directly command; 　The conditions of all overseas Chinese have not been accurately investigated and statistically analyzed, so plans for overseas Chinese affairs cannot be established; 　Overseas Chinese affairs talents have not been fully cultivated, so whenever problems arise, they are passively dealt with on an ad hoc basis, with minimal efficiency; 　The powers and responsibilities of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee and various departments are not clear. When incidents occur, various agencies adhere to established regulations and customs, lacking the spirit of cooperation. All matters are shirked and delayed, resulting in obstruction to all creation and implementation. The above are obvious manifestations of the current unsound state of overseas Chinese affairs administration. Other common mistakes include regarding overseas Chinese affairs as being encompassed by diplomacy, and even completely subsuming the implementation of overseas Chinese affairs administration under diplomacy. However, the entire realm of overseas Chinese affairs is definitely not as simple as being just a part of diplomatic problems. We must first understand that the historical facts of overseas Chinese emigration do not rely on diplomacy for development. We believe that to improve the efficiency of overseas Chinese affairs administration, the initial focus should not be on the size of the agency, but on the soundness of the organization. At the same time, the country must have a clear policy on overseas Chinese affairs. Everyone also understands that simply having an overseas Chinese affairs agency does not mean that the country has overseas Chinese affairs. It is only when there is an overseas Chinese affairs policy and the power to implement the policy that there is overseas Chinese affairs and the life of overseas Chinese affairs can be maintained. Before deciding on our overseas Chinese affairs policy, we must first clearly recognize that the rise and fall of people's emigration and the prosperity and decline of the country and nation are closely related. Otherwise, if overseas Chinese affairs are completely unrelated to national administration, and some even think that the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee is an overseas Chinese community, if such a situation continues, our national overseas Chinese affairs administration will not only be ineffective in the past decades, but also be unable to escape the state of following old ways and being perfunctory and unsound for many years to come.</p>
<p>The Key to the Survival of Overseas Chinese　Everyone, when we discuss the survival of overseas Chinese, we should think of the hundreds of millions of overseas Chinese scattered across the five continents. For hundreds of years, they have been able to survive to this day without the protection of national power, undoubtedly because they have special survival conditions, such as: 　Overseas Chinese are able to endure hardship and be hardworking. In various countries, the working hours have now been reduced to six to seven hours. Most of our overseas Chinese still work eight to twelve hours a day, or even longer. Year after year, except for illness, they do not stop working; 　Overseas Chinese are able to take risks and create. All the labor that Europeans and Americans are unwilling to do or dare not do, as well as the labor that local natives cannot do, our overseas Chinese can undertake with their adventurous nature and creative spirit, fighting desperately against obstacles in the natural world, dedicating their full spirit to creating careers and making contributions to the world's humanity; 　Overseas Chinese live frugally and accept low wages. Whether our overseas Chinese are workers or merchants, they all intensify their work with frugal living, adhering to the principle of benefiting others and themselves, coexisting and prospering together, adapting to local needs, without the slightest ambition, purely serving society. This is the universal fact of the survival of overseas Chinese. In addition, there are two other fundamental factors that contribute to the undiminished survival of overseas Chinese: their great peaceful character and their strong national spirit, which I must also talk about to the public. Generally speaking, for thousands of years, most of the things that humans have done in the world have contained strong plundering behaviors and tiger-like deceitful pursuits. Our overseas Chinese, based on the peaceful nature of our great nation, interact with others with humility and courtesy. As time goes on, the local people are happy to associate with them. Those so-called anti-Chinese elements are all manipulated by a small number of people who harbor evil intentions and have ulterior political motives. If we talk about ordinary natives, they certainly do not have the idea of excluding overseas Chinese. This is worth studying. Moreover, overseas Chinese have left their country for thousands of miles and resided overseas for hundreds of years, without national protection or national education and cultivation, drifting in the borders of countries with strong material civilization or in savage and backward mountainous areas. They should have been assimilated or eliminated. However, overseas Chinese are not only able to maintain the concept of the Chinese nation, but also passionately love their motherland. Therefore, foreigners call it "China with a weak country but strong people." This is the strength of the national spirit of overseas Chinese and is also the fundamental condition for the survival of overseas Chinese. Therefore, in the places where overseas Chinese are scattered overseas, we often see that their customs in life are the same as in mainland China. In overseas Chinese residences, there are often places to worship ancestors. And if it is the home of the Li family, a Chinese-style Li Mansion lantern will be hung at the entrance; if it is the Chen family, a Chen Mansion lantern will be hung. There are also Chinese-style temples built everywhere, the so-called Ya Po Temple (i.e., Guanyin) and Guan Di Temple. In the Americas, there are also so-called Chinatowns, etc. (places where overseas Chinese live mostly preserve Chinese customs). At first glance, it inevitably provokes many criticisms, saying that they are outdated and unchangeable. But if we study it deeply, overseas Chinese have always lacked national protection. If they cannot preserve the old Chinese customs, they would have long been eliminated or assimilated. Then, how can we talk about the problem of Chinese overseas affairs today? Therefore, I personally am not worried about overseas Chinese preserving old Chinese customs, but I am worried about the country not providing protection and abandoning guidance. However, if this continues, the survival conditions of overseas Chinese, as seen today, are no longer so simple. To study their future survival problems, in addition to the above-mentioned items, at a minimum, the country and society must assume considerable responsibility. Because the wheel of the times does not allow us to continue to follow old ways. Overseas Chinese are currently facing many difficulties and dangers. We must take the following rescue measures, which I would like to discuss with everyone: 1. In terms of economy, the organization of overseas Chinese themselves, whether in agriculture, industry, or commerce, must be rapidly promoted to collectivization. It should never be like the past individual independent operation. Because the former is like scattered soldiers fighting, while the latter should pay attention to group warfare. 2. The organization of overseas Chinese society used to be divided into two major parts: in the Americas, it focused on clan organizations (Chen, Li, Zhang, He, Huang, etc.); in Southeast Asia, it focused on regional organizations (such as Guangzhou, Chaozhou, Qiongya, Hakka, Fujian, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, etc.). I am not against this kind of organization, but I think it should be improved and expanded. If a clan is used as an organization, there should be no patriarchal system within it. If a region is used as an organization, there should be no tribalism. Our Premier also pointed out that it is very important to expand from the family to the nation. 3. Good customs of the past should of course be preserved, and new knowledge should also be quickly supplemented to meet the needs of the times. 4. National personnel should not be indifferent to overseas Chinese problems, or even ignore them. They should understand that the entire world problem is the problem of developing emigration. The loss of emigration is the shortening of the life of the country and the nation. 5. Improve the organization of overseas Chinese affairs administration, establish an overseas Chinese affairs policy, and cultivate overseas Chinese affairs talents. 6. Actively do our best to develop overseas Chinese education and find ways to consolidate the economic foundation of overseas Chinese. 7. Effectively implement the management of overseas Chinese emigration, such as guiding, protecting, supervising, investigating, and collecting statistics. The above is my personal superficial view on the key to the survival of overseas Chinese. Of course, our country's entire overseas Chinese affairs are more than this. But I think that in general, we must address the most urgent matters first, hoping that everyone will grasp the needs of the times on the issue of overseas Chinese affairs, catch up, and work hard. Otherwise, the future of overseas Chinese affairs will be fraught with dangers, and the vitality of the country and the nation will also be affected. (End)</p>
<h3>Telephone Problem Committee Today's Joint Meeting</h3>
<p>Discussing Concrete Measures for Joint Resistance</p>
<p>The Special Zone Telephone Problem Committee believes that the Shanghai Telephone Company, regardless of the social depression, rashly implemented the new system, charging according to the number of calls, and many users have reported that the floating calculations are too high. If we do not deal with it and let it control us, the future danger will be even greater. In order to find a solution, a joint meeting of various groups will be held at 2:00 p.m. today on the third floor of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to discuss concrete measures and jointly resist, and to send a letter to the company requesting the installation of a meter to gain user credit and, at a minimum, to cancel the basic number of calls, etc., according to important reports.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Reply　The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday replied to the association regarding the telephone price increase, saying, "In reply, we received your letter on the 5th of this month, requesting us to convene a general meeting of representatives of various industries to quickly devise effective measures to address the telephone price increase. This has been submitted to the 89th Standing Committee meeting for deliberation. The general meeting of representatives of members of our chamber will be held on June 20 as scheduled, and we will consider the situation at that time and submit it for deliberation. We hereby reply for your information."</p>
<p>Shareholder Opposition　Chen Zhixian, of Ping Le Li, Xizang Road, is one of the major shareholders of the Shanghai Telephone Company. Yesterday, he sent a letter to the Special Zone Telephone Problem Committee, expressing his opposition to the telephone price increase and stating that he would contact other shareholders to resist the company's unreasonable actions in order to reduce the burden on users. His original letter reads, "Dear Sirs, I am one of the major shareholders of the Shanghai Telephone Company. Regarding the company's reckless price increase during this most depressed period, disregarding the difficulties of businesses, I have repeatedly sent letters of opposition, but to no avail. Those in charge lack moral values and self-respect, which is hateful and regrettable. Moreover, since I became a shareholder nearly ten years ago, the company has not distributed the official interest. The company disregards the current social situation and increases the burden on users, implementing an inhumane price increase. We do not want to increase telephone charges, but only ask for the official interest that was previously set, which is enough. Please, your association, work hard to resist and achieve final victory. I will contact the shareholders of our country who have invested in the company to be your backing, and will also rectify the internal affairs of the company, save expenses, to meet the budget and reduce the burden on users, in order to achieve the effect of cooperation. I hereby inform you, and I hope you will understand."</p>
<h3>Italian Community Held Victory Celebration the Night Before Last</h3>
<p>The Da Mei Evening News reported that at 6:30 p.m. on Wednesday, the Italian community in this city gathered at the Italian Overseas Chinese Association to celebrate the victory of the Italian army in Abyssinia. Luo Yaguono, the Italian ambassador to China, attended the meeting and gave a speech to the crowd, praising the Italian king's past contributions to the country and his determination to fulfill his responsibilities, increasing the country's happiness and glory. Luo also praised the bravery of the Italian army and the extraordinary strategy of General Badoglio. The crowd then cheered "Long live Mussolini" and sang Fascist songs before dispersing.</p>
<h3>A and B Unified Bonds First Drawing for Principal Repayment Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The unified public bond of 146 million yuan was issued on February 1. After the rush printing of bond certificates was completed, the bond exchange offices in this city and the Central, China, and Communications Banks in various places began handling the exchange and compensation matters on March 11.

<h3>Ling Xianyang Returned to China from Europe Yesterday to Inspect Dockyard Businesses</h3>

He has completed his mission and returned to China via the German postal ship "Na Aishi Nu" at 1:00 p.m. yesterday. More than twenty people, including personnel from the Central Trust Bureau and relatives and friends of Ling, went to the port to welcome him. Ling told the Central News Agency reporter at the port that he left the country in the first month and visited France, Italy, Germany, Denmark, and other four countries to inspect dockyard businesses in order to learn from them. He spent four months, of which he spent the most time in France. The scope of the inspection included all issues such as passenger management, land and water intermodal transportation, and dockyard transportation equipment. Regarding his impressions of this inspection, Germany's dockyard equipment is quite complete, all using the latest machinery. Since the country's revitalization, everything has been remarkable, especially machinery, which has made special progress. Although Denmark is a small country, its dockyard business is the best in the world. The country has many dockyards, and the management and work efficiency are satisfactory in all aspects. The country has a central agency that specializes in managing dockyards and planning everything. The staff members are all serving voluntarily, planning everything in an orderly manner. Italy and France are also quite advanced, but France's handling of administrative management is slightly lacking. Labor costs in our country are low. Regarding dockyard equipment and cargo handling, machinery is certainly fast, but construction must also be determined according to the needs of the environment. He will compile an inspection report and submit it to President Kong and the Qiujiang Dockyard Construction Committee for reference.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Responds to Chamber of Commerce Regarding Doubtful Stamp Tax on Remittance Receipts</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously reported that the Jiangsu Provincial Farmer's Bank in Shengze remitted two copies each of the original and duplicate receipts, each with a face value of 30 cents of national currency. The original receipt was printed with the phrase "Stamp Tax of 2 cents to be affixed by the recipient." The Chamber of Commerce, believing that receipts with a face value of less than three yuan were not required to be stamped according to the law, sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance requesting clarification. Yesterday, the Ministry of Finance issued a reply with document number Shui Zi 9399, stating: "The telegram and copies of the remittance receipts have been received. Remittance receipts are considered as receipts for money and differ from drafts. If the remittance amount received is three yuan or more, the recipient should affix a stamp to the original receipt in accordance with the law. The duplicate receipt is a copy and is exempt from stamping. The Jiangsu Provincial Farmer's Bank's belief that all such receipts, regardless of the amount, must be stamped with a 2-cent stamp is a misunderstanding. You are hereby notified. The original and duplicate receipts (four copies) are returned herewith for your perusal."</p>
<h3>Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief General Association Sends Representatives to Report on Work to Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>The Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief General Association, located at 505 Henan Road, is a charitable organization jointly formed by enthusiastic Chinese and foreign philanthropists. Since advocating construction for disaster relief, its scope has expanded daily, its work has gradually progressed, and its achievements have been outstanding, rarely matched. It has been repeatedly praised by society and rewarded by the government. Overseas Chinese compatriots also have great faith in it, and the number of those who voluntarily remit funds to assist has been increasing daily. Last year, during the fundraising for flood relief, donations from overseas Chinese accounted for nearly half of the total, demonstrating their strong support. The association believes that because overseas Chinese are far away and communication is limited, they may not be fully aware of all the work done over the years. Therefore, it is taking the opportunity of Mr. Baker, the current consultant to the Central Trust Bureau of the Ministry of Finance and executive member of the association, returning to his country on leave, and Mr. Luo Chuanhua, the director of the Shanghai office, being selected to attend the Pacific International Studies Conference in the United States, to request both gentlemen to report in detail on the domestic disaster situation and the projects being undertaken to overseas Chinese compatriots in various cities in Japan, Canada, Honolulu, and major cities in the United States, and to solicit suggestions. It is reported that Mr. Baker is scheduled to depart first on the 19th of this month, and Mr. Luo will depart next month.</p>

<h3>Judge's Advice Leads to Reconciliation, Husband and Wife as Before</h3>
<p>Reunion After Separation, Compassionate Advice, Shao Di Realizes and Returns Home with Husband</p>
<p>Xu Xiaomei, a local young woman residing at No. 7 Yongxin Lane, Daxilu, West Shanghai, is 22 years old this year. In 1931, at the age of 18, she married Xu Xueshan (about the same age as the woman) with Zhu Wenqing and Li Liuquan as matchmakers. After the marriage, the couple's affection grew deeper, but the good times did not last long. After three months, Xu's behavior changed, and he sought new love outside, neglecting and frequently abusing Xiaomei. On June 1st of the lunar calendar last year, the couple argued over trivial matters, and Xiaomei, unable to bear the constant beatings, fled to the Mengjiangtang Nunnery in Yuji Bridge, intending to have her hair cut and become a nun. After being dissuaded by the abbess, she was greeted home by relatives of both sides. However, Xu Xueshan remained unrepentant and forced Xiaomei back to her mother's home in a few days. Recently, Xu Xiaomei, feeling that her husband was so unfaithful and it was impossible to grow old together, filed a petition with the Civil Mediation Office of the Second Special District Court, requesting mediation for divorce, and requesting an order for the defendant Xu Xueshan to pay living expenses of 30 yuan per month until the age of 60, totaling 15,480 yuan. The court granted the request, and yesterday morning, Judge Guo Huaipu summoned both parties to court for mediation. First, the petitioner Xu Xiaomei stated the purpose of her request for mediation, and the defendant Xu Xueshan opposed the divorce and was willing to welcome his wife home to live with him. After the court advised them on the pain of separation and reunion, the petitioner suddenly no longer wanted a divorce and was willing to go home to live together. At this point, the court announced that the mediation was successful. After Xu and his wife left the court, they left together.</p>
<h3>Police Crack Down on Forgery of Consular Seals from Various Countries, Strict Investigation Due to Suspected Political Implications, Two Russians and One Chinese Detained Pending Further Trial</h3>
<p>At around 10:00 AM the day before yesterday, a Russian named Ai Like Changte Jia Chai Qingge, residing at the Salvation Army Hostel on Xiamen Road (formerly the Western Prison), reported to the Old Gate Police Station that a signature book used when he traveled around various countries had been stolen and requested an investigation. The Chief of the Mountain Police ordered Western Detective Su Haofu and Chinese Detective He Renrui to investigate. While the detectives were preparing to accompany Ai to his residence for investigation, Ai suddenly left the police station, his whereabouts unknown. The Chinese and Western detectives then went to the reported residence. Upon arriving at the open space of the Salvation Army Hostel, they saw Ai holding a paper package. Suspecting him, they went up and asked why he had left the police station without permission. When Ai saw the detectives, he hid the paper package inside his clothes. Suspecting him, the detectives took the package and opened it. Inside were forged consular seals from various countries, such as the seals of the Philippine French Consulate, the Manila French Consulate, and the Chinese Consulate in Iloilo, as well as letters. They also found a bottle of ink eraser in Ai's room and brought it back to the police station along with the seals. Suspecting political implications, they notified the Municipal Public Security Bureau, the French Concession Police Department Political Section, and the Public Concession Police Department Political Section. Each sent personnel to the Old Gate Police Station for joint interrogation. According to Ai's confession, he was preparing to forge a passport because he intended to leave China. The two seals of the Philippine and Manila French Consulates were purchased from Chi Rigan, a Cantonese residing at No. 3, Alley 272, Wuchang Road, Beiyihe China Shipping Club, for eight yuan. The detectives then went to the club to arrest Chi, but he was not there. They found several seals of the Finnish, Polish, and Egyptian Consulates, as well as letters, in his room. Later, Chinese Detective He Renrui arrested him at the Dadong Hotel. In addition to the name Chi Rigan, Chi also used the names Xi Qiangsheng, Yimanuoer Aiduohua, and Feilankai Tuo. A further search of Room 4 of the Wusong Hotel at No. 616, Wusong Road, resulted in the arrest of another accomplice, a Russian named Fula Dimao Kaier Tuo. Chi Rigan claimed at the police station that he was British. The Chief of Police ordered Western Detective Smith to investigate at the British Consulate, but the British Consulate did not recognize him. Therefore, yesterday morning, the three suspects were escorted to the First Special District Court Criminal Division 1. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang explained the circumstances, stating that the actions of the defendants had unknown motives and were still under investigation. Therefore, he requested detention in accordance with Articles 76 and 101 of the Criminal Procedure Law and submitted the seized evidence. Judge Feng Shide reviewed the report and ordered that the three suspects Ai and others be detained for one week.</p>

He was taken to the police station and first sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Yesterday, the police sent Zhou to the Criminal Division 1 of the Second Special District Court. Judge Wang Gangxu interrogated him. The Legal Department lawyer Fei Xizhen explained the case and prosecuted him for robbery. Then, the victim, Zhu Yu, explained the situation of the robbery. When Zhou Achun was interrogated, he said, "I came to Shanghai to borrow money from my old boss, who promised to give it to me on the 28th of last month. However, I was unable to borrow it, which led me to become homeless in Shanghai. I was impoverished and had no way to rob to make money to go home."

<p>Wu Rongsheng, a native of Yancheng, residing at No. 150 Taoyuanfang, Tiantong Road, has been prosperous in the business of insuring cargo on the Huangpu River, loading and unloading goods on barges, and disembarking from ferries. Recently, Yang Changsong, a fugitive fellow villager, coveted his business and colluded with his friend Tao Jingzhi and Fei Wanshun (both from Yancheng), who had previously worked for Wu. On the 1st of this month, they had Fei take advantage of an opportunity to throw two packages of the drug red pills into the bottom of Wu's cabinet, report it to the police station, arrest him to the court, receive criminal punishment, and then compete for his job after he was imprisoned. The matter was discovered by Xing Wenzhu, a fellow villager and friend of Fei, who secretly told Wu to check under the cabinet. There were indeed two packages of red pills, one wrapped in yellow cloth and one wrapped in black cloth. After being opened, there were more than 200 pills in total, which were thrown into the trash can. Wu's wife, Zhu, gave Xing a reward of five yuan and he left. The next day, Xing came again and said that Fei had found out that he had exposed his plot and was making things difficult for him. He could not stand in Shanghai and repeatedly borrowed money, eventually demanding 50 yuan. If not, he would report the red pills to the police. Wu then knew that Xing was not a good person either. Yesterday afternoon, he delivered the money and reported the situation to the Hongkou Police Station. Chinese Detective Zhu Jihuang, Detective Ni Jilai, and Zhang Yaoji secretly went to Taoyuanfang Alley, disguised as merchants, and waited. Xing Wenzhu arrived as expected, and Wu Rongsheng gave him the money with the Central Bank ten-yuan notes marked in advance to collect. As Xing was about to leave the alley with the money, detectives Ni and Zhang stepped forward, arrested him, and searched him for the legal tender. Afterwards, they went to No. 318 Yangzho Road, arrested Fei and Tao, and took them to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special District Court. Lawyer Li Zhishan of the Public Works Department explained the case, stating that the investigation revealed that the defendant Tao Jingzhi had committed cases such as township chief abduction from 1930 to 1933. The case was suspicious. After being detained, he was released due to insufficient evidence. In this case, please postpone the detailed investigation. Then, the detectives reported the process of the case, and the ten-yuan evidence note was presented. Wu Rongsheng and his wife proved the previous situation. The three defendants were questioned, and their confessions were ambiguous. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered them to be remanded and re-examined after the investigation.</p>
<h3>Zhu Xiongwu and Others Accused of Defamation, High Court President's Case Transferred to Shanghai for Trial, He Jinshi and Chen Shitao Promoted to Prosecute Zhu Xiongwu and Others, Requested Transfer of Jurisdiction After Public Prosecution</h3>
<p>Zhu Xiongwu, former clerk of the Jiangsu High Court, is from Yiwu County, Zhejiang Province. He is the nephew of Zhu Xianwen, former President of the Jiangsu High Court and Counselor of the Ministry of Judicial Administration. Zhu Xiongwu has been working in the High Court for more than ten years and has been the chief clerk of the First Civil Division. In the winter of 1935, Zhu Xiongwu's reputation was poor, and he was reported to the Ministry of Justice by the current President of the High Court, Zhu Shusheng, and ordered to be dismissed. Unexpectedly, Zhu and a group of colleagues who had also been dismissed printed leaflets in the name of the Jiangsu Judicial Improvement Association, defaming President Zhu. They were acting as witnesses for the divisional clerks in office. After Zhu Xiongwu was dismissed, he probed the results of a certain property division case, which was also listed in the leaflet. Therefore, President Zhu ordered Prosecutor Lu Wenqin of the Wu County Local Court to search Zhu Xiongwu's Suzhou residence. Although the leaflets were not found, letters between Zhu and Shanghai lawyer He Yi regarding the case of Miao Wen's obstruction of national currency were found, so Zhu Xiongwu was detained. It was later found that Zhu Xiongwu and lawyer Shu Feilu Wenguang were smoking opium together, so the Lu's house was searched, and evidence of fraud and a book of cases handled were found, so Lu was also detained. Zhu Xiongwu was also sent to the Anti-Smoking Committee for punishment for smoking opium. In the midst of the uproar, Chen Chaozuan (from the same town as Zhu), who had previously served as a clerk in the High Court, had been ordered to transfer to the First Branch of the Xiaojiang Oil High Court last year. Unexpectedly, his wife saw Zhu Xiongwu's arrest in Suzhou and wrote a letter to her husband in Qingjiangpu, saying that all the evidence had been hidden, etc., which was discovered by the president of the court. Chen Chaozuan and Zhu Xiongwu were suspected of jointly defaming President Zhu, and Chen was handed over to the Prosecutor's Office and escorted to Suzhou. He was also detained by the Wu County Local Court, and his hands were searched. At the same time, the prosecutor repeatedly summoned witnesses for interrogation. Therefore, Shanghai lawyer He Qi was asked by the Wu County Local Court to assist in the arrest and escort to Suzhou, and the promotion of Chen Shitao, a judge of the Wuxi Local Court, was guaranteed. Until recently, He Qi was first found not guilty due to lack of evidence, and Judge Chen Qitao dismissed the prosecution. Zhu Xiongwu, Lu Wenguang, Chen Chaozuan, and Chen's wife were all publicly prosecuted. However, most of the defendants were former High Court officials, and the President of the High Court was the victim in this case. Therefore, it was considered that there was a risk of bias in the trial in the same place, so they applied for a transfer of jurisdiction. The application has been approved by the higher court, and the case has been transferred to the Shanghai Court for trial.</p>
<h3>Conflict Between Security Team Members and Residents</h3>
<p>Mutual Injuries</p>
<p>At 11:30 PM the night before last, in the Tai Bang area of Tongjia Bridge, Zhongshan Road, Zhabei, a misunderstanding between members of the security team and residents led to a major conflict. During the disturbance, someone fired a warning shot into the air. The cause was that Xiu Mei, the younger sister of Chen Youjun, who was a resident in Nanjing at No. 43 Tai Bang, had a disagreement with her sister-in-law, Zhou, and they started arguing. At 11:30 PM, Xiu Mei waited for her brother Youjun to return home from the Shenxin No. 9 Flour Factory. She related the situation to him. They both stood outside the house. Two security team members passed by and saw a man and a woman, suspecting that they were having a secret rendezvous. They stepped forward and questioned them sternly. Chen replied that they were siblings. The tone of their reply was not agreeable. The two sides started bickering. One security team member slapped Chen's cheeks twice. Another security team member blew a whistle. Members gathered from the security team numbering between fifty and sixty. Seeing the situation was unfavorable, Chen's sister turned around and entered the house, calling out to relatives and fellow workers from the factory, numbering between twenty and thirty, who armed themselves with iron bars and other weapons, and began fighting. The shouts shook the sky, and the noise was extremely chaotic. As a result, Chen Youjun suffered injuries to his chest, abdomen, head, and face. Zhou Jidao, the older brother of Chen's wife, was injured in the waist. Chen's friend Wang Laowu was injured in the head and face. Security team members Hou Maofu was injured in the chest and abdomen, and Zhang Fa was injured in the head. At around 3:00 AM, a large number of police officers from the Zhenru Police Station arrived and took the seven men and women involved in the incident, Chen, Zhou, Wang, Hou, and Zhang, etc., to the police station for questioning. Because the case was related to a crowd fighting and mutual injuries, the case was submitted to the Third Section of the General Bureau for questioning at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon.</p>
<h3>New House Fitted with Glass - Apprentice Falls to His Death</h3>
<p>Slippery Floor, Ladder Slips, Head Injury Leads to Death</p>
<p>A new house at No. 172, Chunyang Lane, No. 211 Dongyouheng Road, is currently unoccupied. On the afternoon of the 5th of this month, at around 1 PM, Zheng Hongmao Glass Store at No. 383 Wusong Road sent an apprentice, Zhong Zhishan (age 18, from Chongming), to fit a piece of glass in the front building. The apprentice placed the ladder against the window frame and was about to install the glass. Unexpectedly, the floor there was coated with glossy lacquer and was extremely slippery, causing the ladder to slide down as soon as he stepped on it. The apprentice fell out of the window, suffering a severe head injury. A painter working downstairs saw this and immediately reported it to the Jiaxing Road police station. An ambulance was called to the scene, and he was rushed to Tongren Hospital. However, the treatment was ineffective, and he died at 11:30 AM the day before yesterday. The police station sent detective Gu Wenyao to investigate. The body was then taken to the forensic examination office on Fielun Road. Yesterday morning, Zhang Zongru, a prosecutor appointed by the First Special District Court, arrived at the office to examine the body. First, Chief Chinese Constable Li Jingshou reported the previous situation. Then, Zheng Bolin testified that he was the owner of the glass store. The deceased had been learning this trade in another store for more than two years and had only been at his place for fifty days. He was introduced by his third older brother, who is not currently in Shanghai, so the deceased's family could not be notified. He requested to temporarily claim the body. After hearing the testimony, Zhang ruled that Zhong Zhishan, male, had died from a head injury caused by a work-related fall. The body was handed over to his shop owner, Zheng Bolin, for claiming and burial.</p>
<h3>Man Crushed to Death by Shanghai-Songjiang Train</h3>
<p>Body Resembles a Worker, Crushed in Half at the Waist</p>
<p>On the Shanghai-Songjiang railway tracks at the Baoyuan Road crossing in Zhabei, yesterday evening at around 9 PM, a man in his twenties, wearing a blue cloth shirt and pants, resembling a worker, was walking along the tracks. A train returning from Songjiang to Shanghai came speeding along. The man was unable to avoid it and was struck down, crushed in half at the waist, and died a gruesome death. A track worker found the body and reported it to the Yongxing Road police station. The police were dispatched to investigate and ordered the local warden to report to the local court to send a prosecutor to examine the body. As the man's name was unknown and no family members came to claim him, the railway bureau prepared a coffin for burial.</p>
<h3>Women's Temperance Union to Celebrate Mother's Day Tomorrow</h3>

<h3>28th Annual Meeting of the Young Women's Christian Association</h3>
<p>To Be Held at 5 PM Today</p>
<p>The earliest established Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) in the country is the Shanghai YWCA. It began engaging in social work in 1904 and was officially established in 1908. With its long history and outstanding achievements, it has always been admired by society. After relocating to No. 999 Jing'an Temple Road this year, it has been striving for further progress, hoping to make the association a central area, service area, and educational area for women from all walks of life in Shanghai. On the one hand, it connects leading women to serve society, and on the other hand, it guides the general public of women to embark on the path of construction, thereby expanding the new movement. It is reported that the association is scheduled to hold its 28th annual meeting on Friday, May 8, at 5 PM. At that time, in addition to reporting on the work of the past year, so that members can assess achievements and discuss future policies, and hoping that all members will work together, there will also be refreshments.</p>
<h3>Italian Bank Expands Business</h3>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the Italian Bank on Nanjing Road has a total capital of 2 million Italian lire and has been operating for many years. Recently, in view of the sluggishness of the Shanghai market and the sluggishness of financial circulation, in order to seek the development of banking affairs and close to the trade of Chinese merchants, Kang Zhiyin and Wu Guoying, experts in the financial industry, were specially appointed as Chinese managers to specialize in all banking business and credit lending matters. Since the commencement of service, business has been thriving. In recent days, deposits have been received in succession, amounting to more than one million yuan. It is now heard that the original Nanjing Road address is too narrow for office use, and it is planned to move to a certain large building on Jiangxi Road in the near future to operate and expand its appearance.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Licenses Extended to Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Regarding the dispute between rickshaw merchants and the Municipal Council, according to news from the Vehicle Committee of the Municipal Council, the rickshaw merchants have recently paid all of the May license fees to the Municipal Council. At the same time, the bank receipts for the April Mutual Aid Society fees have also been submitted to the Municipal Council, and a written guarantee has been made to pay the Mutual Aid Society fees for this month by the end of this month. However, to obtain rickshaw licenses, each rickshaw owner must bring their owner's certificate for endorsement. Since the owner's certificates have been jointly stored in the bank by the rickshaw owners, it is temporarily difficult to issue so many rickshaw licenses. Therefore, the Municipal Council has decided that if the rickshaw owners can fulfill all the conditions before June, the deadline for obtaining licenses may be temporarily extended to the 9th of this month. The police authorities' preparations to detain unlicensed rickshaws after the 6th will not need to be implemented as there is now a way to resolve the issue.</p>
<h3>Request to Fill in the French Concession Canal</h3>
<p>Residents Recently Submitted Letters to the Health Bureau</p>
<p>Residents of western Shanghai, including Zhu Bofan, in view of the existence of the French Concession Canal, which is not only useless but also hinders public health and international image, have written to the Municipal Health Bureau, requesting that it jointly work with the Public Works Bureau to fill it in as soon as possible. The letter states: "The original French Concession Canal in western Shanghai, starting from Xujiahui in the south, passes through various polluted areas. The river water is completely black. Every summer, the stench not only reaches the gate of Datong University but also extends to Daxilu. The river has long been silted up and blocked, and the mosquitoes and flies produced here are extremely fierce. They fly everywhere, whether day or night, and are not afraid of people at all. Therefore, the Chinese and foreign residents nearby are all complaining and expressing dissatisfaction. The location of the canal connects the junction of the Chinese and French Concessions. At a time when this new movement is being promoted, leaving such an unclean stain in Shanghai is detrimental to public health and damages the international image. Therefore, we hereby submit a letter requesting your esteemed bureau to quickly send staff to investigate and, together with the Public Works Bureau, immediately carry out the filling in of the canal to show the practical implementation of the principles of promoting a new life."

<h3>Minutes of the Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Society Board Meeting</h3>
<p>Insurance Has Been Launched, Cemetery is Underway, Rickshaw Pullers Express Willingness to Pay Mutual Aid Society Fees</p>
<p>The Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Society held its 29th board meeting on the 5th of this month. Apart from rickshaw business representatives Yin Zhiling and Hou Shaocan, who were absent, all other directors attended the meeting on time. The most important matters discussed were the reports of the various committees. According to the report of the Insurance Committee, rickshaw puller insurance was officially established on May 1st. After the death of a member, his family can receive compensation of 40 yuan in national currency. There are also specific compensation amounts for those who lose limbs or eyesight due to accidents. Furthermore, the Medical Committee reported that the Western District Branch Hospital is insufficient and that all beds have been decided to increase from eighteen to twenty-six. The hospital's medical services are extremely busy, and it has various benefits that it is run by the Mutual Aid Society itself. However, patients who cannot be accommodated by the hospital still need to be sent to other hospitals, and their expenses will be compensated.</p>
<p>The Personnel Committee held a meeting on February 29th and made the following decisions: Actively seek a cemetery address for rickshaw pullers in northern Shanghai; Contact preferential prices for coffins and notify rickshaw pullers' families; Lower-level staff of the Mutual Aid Society should be able to join the insurance plan; Add a primary school for rickshaw pullers' children on Robberon Road, but before that, a survey should be conducted on the number of rickshaw pullers' children living in the area; Establish a rickshaw pullers' savings bank.</p>
<p>The above reports of the various committees, as well as the society's periodic financial reports and the situation of relief work, have all been passed by the board of directors. According to a recent report, a total of 30 rickshaw puller representatives from five districts submitted a report to the society before the board meeting, stating that all 28,564 rickshaw pullers in the Shanghai Public Concession have signed a printed petition, listing the registration number, name, and fingerprints of each rickshaw puller, and submitted it to the chief of the Municipal Council, clearly acknowledging that the Mutual Aid Society fees are specifically used for the welfare undertakings of all registered rickshaw pullers, declaring that they are very willing to continue to pay. The 30 rickshaw puller representatives certified that there was no fabrication or duplication in these petitions. The rickshaw license office also verified that there were no errors in the names, numbers, and fingerprints of the rickshaw pullers. It was found that this type of petition was spontaneously organized by the rickshaw pullers because the rickshaw owners resolutely declared that the rickshaw pullers were unwilling to continue paying the Mutual Aid Society fees to express the true intentions of the rickshaw pullers. The rickshaw pullers who have signed have reached 80% of the total number of registered rickshaw pullers and were obtained in one day, which also shows the inaccuracy of the rickshaw owners' counter-propaganda. Furthermore, the revised constitution and by-laws of the Mutual Aid Society, in Chinese and English, have now been printed. Those interested in this matter can request to read them nearby. The Mutual Aid Society's report, up to the end of 1935, has been published in Chinese, while the English version is still in print.</p>

Sincerely, To the Shanghai Shenbao Museum, East Asia Construction Engineering Company, May 7.</p>
<h3>In Jinling</h3>
<p>— Sightseeing Tour of the New Destiny - Bai Liu</p>
<p>Smoke veils the cold water, the moon illuminates the sandy shores, moored at night by the Qinhuai River near a tavern:</p>
<p>The merchant girls are oblivious to the sorrows of a fallen nation, across the river they incessantly sing "The Flowers of the Rear Courtyard."</p>
<p>The sixty-li-long, expansive Stone City, once possessed a glorious history! The lingering aura of the Six Dynasties once made this land shine! Imagine, when it was the capital of emperors in the past, those who dwelled here were undoubtedly all elegantly dressed figures! As it was the center of culture and politics, romance and darkness were also contained and flourishing within it. On the Qinhuai River, painted boats came and went. The taverns on both banks resounded with music and songs throughout the night. Mad indulgence. It's just like a young woman forgetting herself when favored!</p>
<p>However, she has aged. Now she is an aging noblewoman, she has been forgotten. Now she is once again brought up from oblivion, but the smile on that aged face cannot conceal the mottled traces of tears!</p>
<p>The sixty-li-long city wall, bearing wounds, silently, for hundreds of years, remains the same.</p>
<p>The Qinhuai River, like the belt of an abandoned noblewoman, still faithfully surrounds Jinling!</p>
<p>Those densely packed houses, however, have witnessed countless changes in people's lives; they have seen a lively soul emerge and disappear without a trace, until the appearance of the next batch. They have witnessed the vicissitudes of fate of generations of descendants.</p>
<p>Now, the pampered and weak descendants are struggling in the wind and rain day and night.</p>
<p>"Can they struggle through?"</p>
<p>"Can they truly wash away all the tears and restore that proud countenance?"</p>
<p>Originally, due to its geographical environment and the determination of its historical destiny, this society has always been progressing. While other parts were still lingering in the medieval rural social stage, this place was about to leap into an industrial and commercial social form. However, in its development path, it encountered obstruction and destruction!</p>
<p>The peaceful days gradually had disturbances, and finally the torrent rushed in, causing turbulence and looting of this comfortable society!</p>
<p>The seedlings of industry were broken and oppressed, and could only develop morbidly towards the path of commerce. All national capital turned into the process of comprador of imperialists, or invaded the countryside, concentrated land rights, and deprived the peasants of their happiness. If this contradiction is not resolved, society will develop even more morbidly! The shadows of society will fill the entire society even more.</p>
<p>Because this society's development has undergone changes, its progress is very slow. After so many days, the difference in progress in between is very limited. The hierarchical structure of this society has also changed very little. Therefore, the division of its social classes still shows the form of a rural society. The opposition between classes is not as strict and distant as in an industrial society!</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the social classes here are: the upper class is the aristocracy, landlords, large merchants, and a small number of industrialists. The next class is the middle-class merchants, independent farmers, handicraftsmen, and general freelancers. The next layer is small merchants, tenant farmers, and general morbid products such as singing girls and prostitutes. The bottom layer is poor farmers, workers, apprentices, and general social parasites.</p>
<p>Although it is said that society has divided into classes following natural trends, are these classes permanently fixed? Are they permanently isolated from each other? A new, great force is attempting to control natural trends and remove the layers of shadows from society under the broad daylight! In Jinling, the sudden appearance of one or two miracles foreshadows the movement of shadows. A ray of light shines far away on the horizon.</p>
<p>The capital city is indeed the political center at present, but it does not contain any corruption. All civil servants have been infected by a new spirit. They have mostly become or are becoming people of a new era. There is no corruption contained within this! Most recently, following civilian training, civil servants also undergo training. At dawn or dusk, one can often see many white-bearded civil servants standing in formation "one two one."</p>
<p>There are many soldiers wearing military uniforms and horizontal or diagonal leather belts, especially on Sundays, almost every alley has their shadows. They are all modern soldiers, modern Chinese soldiers. People say that the era can be reflected in thought and literature, I say that it can also be reflected in the spirit of soldiers. In the era of warlord separatism, there were those wolfish and fierce soldiers; and in this era when the depression has reached its extreme and society is about to turn over, a new force will inevitably emerge. This force is contained in a group of new soldiers. They all have pure hearts, lofty thoughts and humble attitudes. On buses, they often give up their seats, and they often enthusiastically engage in public welfare undertakings. They have a spirit of practical work.</p>
<p>These, these are all harbingers of social turnaround! The shadows of society are moving, and a ray of light is shining far away on the horizon.</p>
<p>However, due to the existence of contradictions in the times, the shadows of society are very thick.</p>
<p>On cold, windy days, batches of people in tattered clothes, old and young, huddle in the streets and alleys, emitting miserable wails. Thousands of people gather at the gates of porridge kitchens to beg for food.</p>
<p>Many rough-handed and coarse-footed girls have been added to the banks of the Qinhuai River. In the employment agencies, many pitiful eyes are looking forward to something.</p>
<p>The population of the capital city increases every year, affecting the expansion of the lower layers of society. These people all come from the countryside. It can be seen that rural bankruptcy is serious! For example, in the Jiangbei area, year after year, due to the harm of floods and droughts and the invasion of commercial capital, the land of general small and medium-sized farmers has been exploited. This has made them unable to stand firm in the countryside, so they have to come to the city to find their destiny. The old and weak can only beg for food. Men, if they are lucky, can find some work. If they are unlucky, they are forced by livelihood and can only become bandits. Young women enter employment agencies, and young girls can only sell themselves into prostitution.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as the capital city is the political center, generally unemployed intellectuals come here to find a way out. If you go to a small inn run by local people in this city, you will see many sallow-faced young people lying on thin bedding, eating sesame cakes and spending their days in year-like despair! Every day you can also read the cries of unemployed young people in the newspapers.</p>
<p>Making the rural farmers touch their mottled backs and shed tears, the slums are always cold, orphaned and helpless children sell things on the streets day and night, more than four thousand banner people recall their past power and are in a daze, and the shantytowns are often full of curses of fate, these are even more needless to say!</p>
<p>However, these are precisely the products of the contradictions of the times. To adjust them, unless we fundamentally resolve the contradictions of this era!</p>
<p>We must destroy all forces that restrict our development of vitality! We must remove all external sinister and oppressive forces, otherwise, the development of vitality will be restricted, and social diseases will continue to arise! The whole society only hears cries and wails!</p>
<p>Although Jinling is dressed in new clothes, the broad Zhongshan Road, tall buildings and mansions, and majestic government agencies, can't hide that lonely face and mottled traces of tears!</p>
<p>The Ming Mausoleum silently watches, and the Zhongshan Mausoleum also gazes from afar on Zhongshan Mountain! (The End)</p>

<h3>Regulations for Establishing Free and Publicly Funded School Places at All Levels of Schools</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education Orders All Schools, Bureaus, and Departments to Implement Starting Next Semester</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 7th) The Ministry of Education, based on the principles of the "Methods for Establishing Free and Publicly Funded School Places at All Levels of Schools" approved by the Executive Yuan, has formulated the relevant regulations and issued an order on the 7th to all public and private colleges and universities, and to all school bureaus and departments, to strictly comply starting next academic year. From now on, children with outstanding talents or young people with excellent academic performance and conduct, even if their families are poor, can expect to have an equal opportunity to receive a complete education due to the preferential treatment of the country and society. The full text of the regulations, consisting of twenty articles, outlines the main points as follows: In order to reward and assist students from poor families who are physically sound, have outstanding talents, and achieve excellent results, schools should establish free and publicly funded school places in accordance with the provisions of the regulations. Free school places shall be exempt from tuition fees, as well as physical education, library, experimental and other similar fees. Private schools should, in accordance with the following provisions, collect small amounts in special circumstances. Primary schools should set up free school places for more than 40% of the total number of children in the school. At least 20% should be set up in the 25th year, and then gradually increased year by year, with the limit to reach the standard of 40% in the 28th year. (B) Secondary schools, junior and senior high schools, and junior and senior vocational schools, should set up free school places for more than 15% of the total number of students in the school. At least 8% should be set up in the 25th year, and then gradually increased year by year, with the limit to reach the standard of 15% in the 28th year. (C) Colleges and universities should set up free school places for more than 10% of the total number of students in the school. At least 5% should be set up in the 25th year, and then gradually increased year by year, with the limit to reach the standard of 10% in the 28th year. In addition to being exempt from tuition fees, publicly funded school places should also be given the minimum food, lodging, uniforms, books, and other expenses in accordance with the provisions of Article 16. All levels of public schools across the country, in addition to setting up free school places, should also set up publicly funded school places in accordance with the following provisions: (A) Ordinary primary schools and short-term primary schools should set up at least 4% of the total number of students in the 25th year, and then gradually increase the number. (B) Vocational schools, junior and senior high schools, and junior and senior vocational schools, should set up at least 3% of the total number of students in the 25th year, and then gradually increase the number. The publicly funded treatment of secondary normal schools shall be handled in accordance with the regulations for normal schools. (C) Colleges and universities should set up at least 2% of the total number of students in the 25th year, and then gradually increase the number. Private schools at all levels with relatively sufficient funding or receiving government assistance should also consider setting up publicly funded school places. The funding for setting up publicly funded school places in public schools at all levels across the country should be based on the principle of reducing expenditures within the school's regular expenses. Before the start of each summer vacation, schools at all levels should determine the number of free and publicly funded school places to be set up in the next year based on the general number of students in each approved school and the proportion specified in these regulations, and report it to the competent education administrative authorities. At the end of each academic year, schools at all levels should report the free and publicly funded school places that have been set up in the current year, as well as the list of free and publicly funded students, to the competent education administrative authorities. The free and publicly funded school places that should be set up by schools at all levels should be allocated to students in each grade of the school. The number of places allocated to newly recruited students in the following year should also be included in the admission brochure for public announcement. Students from poor families whose families are unable to afford the cost of their children's schooling may seek two or more reliable guarantors to apply for proof from the competent education administrative authorities in their original county or city, or in the county or city where they have resided for more than three years. The competent education administrative authorities in each county and city should organize a review committee for free and publicly funded school places to review the aforementioned applications. Those who are qualified shall be submitted to the county mayor or city mayor for the issuance of a certificate of poverty. Before the establishment of the review committee, the aforementioned review and certification may be temporarily handled by the county or city education administrative authorities under the authority of the county mayor or city mayor. Those who apply for free or publicly funded treatment should do so in accordance with the following provisions: (A) Applicants should submit a certificate of poverty at the time of registration. (B) Students in school should submit a certificate of poverty before the start of each academic year. Schools at all levels that set up both free school places and publicly funded school places in accordance with these regulations should give the publicly funded school places to students from poor families whose entrance examination results or school grades are better. For students who receive free or publicly funded treatment, if their conduct and academic performance average less than Grade B, the schools may stop their free or publicly funded treatment. Schools should organize a committee to jointly review and approve the granting of free and publicly funded school places. Schools that set up publicly funded school places shall determine the expenses given to students within the following ranges according to the local living conditions: ordinary primary schools, 10 to 30 yuan per person per year; junior high schools and junior vocational schools, 40 to 80 yuan per person per year; senior high schools and senior vocational schools, 60 to 100 yuan per person per year; colleges and universities, 150 to 150 yuan per person per year. The treatment of publicly funded school places in short-term primary schools shall be determined by each school according to the local situation. If students who have graduated from free and publicly funded schools are found to have falsely claimed poverty or forged certificates, the schools may recover all fees from the student or their guarantor after verification, and may stop issuing academic transcripts or graduation certificates. Within two months after the start of each academic year, the education bureaus of each province and city, and public and private colleges and universities, should report the progress of handling free and publicly funded quotas to the Ministry of Education for record-keeping. Various scholarships and quotas established by schools, the funding for which comes from public or private institutions, organizations, or individuals, and is not paid from the school's regular budget, should still be maintained and should not be used to offset the free or publicly funded quotas stipulated in these regulations.</p>

<h3>The Vocational Education Society Decides to Raise Funds to Purchase an Airplane to Celebrate Chiang Kai-shek's Birthday</h3>
<p>Fundraising will commence from the 11th of this month and will be limited to one month. All collected funds will be sent together.</p>
<p>The Chinese Vocational Education Society recently received a letter from the General Association of the China Aviation Association, along with the "Methods for Expanding the Aviation Patriotic Movement in Shanghai City and Raising Funds to Purchase an Airplane to Celebrate Chiang Kai-shek's Birthday." The Society believes that self-improvement and national humiliation evoke universal sympathy, and that saving the nation and ensuring its survival are matters of inescapable duty. Now that the central government authorities are exhausting their wisdom and loyalty in shouldering the great responsibility of saving the nation, all citizens should do their best according to their abilities and contribute to the purchase of an airplane to celebrate Chiang Kai-shek's birthday and strengthen national defense. There is no better way to serve the country. Therefore, starting from May 11th, the Society will earnestly discuss and encourage each other, and all colleagues in the offices and affiliated institutions, as well as students and farmers, will donate whatever amount they can afford to purchase the airplane. The donations will be purely voluntary, without any compulsion. The general affairs section of the office, and the heads of the one, two, and three supplementary schools, and the chief instructor in the suburbs of Shanghai, will be responsible for collecting and forwarding the funds. The names of all donors, regardless of the amount donated, will be disclosed in the Guoxun Weekly. The fundraising will be completed within one month.</p>
<h3>Nanjing Huwen Girls' High School Academic Exhibition</h3>
<p>Nanjing Huwen Girls' High School was founded in the 25th year before the Republic of China by Miss Shadnna of the American Methodist Church. It initially had only six students. Since 1927, when Madam Liu Fen, the wife of the late educator and former Southeast University President Dr. Liu Boming, became the headmistress, the school's reputation has grown daily and its achievements have been remarkable. The student body has now increased to seven high school classes and nine junior high school classes, totaling more than 600 students. The school's annual expenditure is more than 60,000 yuan, with the church providing a subsidy of less than 10,000 yuan. The remaining expenses are managed and maintained by the headmistress through administrative income planning. Two years ago, the Nanjing Municipal Social Bureau awarded the school a bonus for its excellent exam results. In the past two years, the school has consistently ranked among the top performers in competitions such as cleanliness, winning the overall championship at the city sports meet, first place in Mandarin speech contests, air defense lectures, Boy Scout drills and camping, and general cleanliness inspections. Headmistress Liu Fen treats the school as her home and the students as her children. The school motto is "Sincerity, Perseverance, Diligence, and Simplicity," and moral education emphasizes character transformation. She maintains frequent contact with students' families, holding parent-teacher conferences and visiting parents to discuss matters related to cooperation in education. In order to give students' families a clearer understanding of the school's internal affairs, the school is showcasing students' academic achievements in various subjects such as civics, science, literature, history, crafts, and art, regardless of their grades, in an open exhibition on May 4th and 5th. Over 8,000 people visited the exhibition in those two days. General comments praised the school's Chinese language achievements, such as diaries and essays, as being well-corrected. Students' calligraphy was also excellent. History and geography displays, particularly those related to national humiliation, were thought-provoking and helpful in arousing national rejuvenation. The school's administrative exhibition featured organizational charts, statistical tables, and various statistics, all clearly presented. The artwork was also precise. In particular, the achievements in science best reflected the rapid progress made in the past two years, due to the school's improved experimental facilities and the collaborative efforts of teachers and students.</p>
<h3>Dachung Boy Scout Camp in Suzhou</h3>
<p>Dachung Middle School on Mountain Road in this city places great emphasis on Boy Scout training. This semester, a specialist has been hired to train the drum corps and additional equipment such as tents and drums has been added. At the previous session, the achievements of this activity were excellent and many awards were won. It is reported that the school's second joint platoon camping event will be held starting today. The Boy Scout trainer, Chen, will lead more than 50 members to Suzhou. The camp will be located near Fengqiao Lao Wu, where various field activities will be practiced. It is scheduled to return to school on the 11th.</p>

<h3>Securities: Many Longs Turn to Selling, Public Bonds Experience a Sudden Downturn, Overall Decline of 5 to 8 Jiao Across Four Sessions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange saw a sudden shift in market sentiment towards easing. The previous bullish momentum had ceased, and there was a noticeable shift towards selling. Bears seized the opportunity to exert pressure, creating an impression of imminent collapse. From morning till evening, the market price showed no signs of recovery. However, the excessive drop might trigger a rebound. Tomorrow is National Humiliation Day and a holiday, so there shouldn't be a significant market shock today. Yesterday's trend was consistently weak, with no reversal.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Rumors of Negative News Resurface, Yarn Market Experiences Alarming Downturn</h3>
<p>Market Tumbles in a Straight Line, Distant Months Plunge by Over Three Yuan</p>
<p>After rebounding the previous day, the yarn market experienced another sharp downturn yesterday, with an exceptionally panicky atmosphere. Widespread rumors on the market suggested that the US cotton and wheat loan might be finalized. This fueled anxiety, leading to a flood of sellers and a straight-line decline in the market. Distant months for standard yarn reportedly plummeted by over three yuan.</p>
<p>Long Positions Wavering</p>
<p>At the opening of the standard yarn market this morning, all months showed sluggish and weak signs, with a slight decline of 0.02 to 0.03 yuan. However, due to the brisk trading of spot yarn the previous day, sellers were not eager to sell. Unexpectedly, after the second session, the situation changed abruptly. Sellers flooded in, and the market gradually declined as it opened. The heavy atmosphere and conflicting tax rumors all favored short positions. As a result, all months fell by 1.45 to 2.1 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day. The afternoon opening was unremarkable, and the momentum weakened further. However, after entering the market, raw cotton prices fell, and spot yarn sales were not as strong as the previous day. Furthermore, numerous rumors caused long positions to waver, and the market trended lower. As a result, all months fell by 0.6 to 1.235 yuan compared to the closing price in the morning. May and June futures even broke the 200 yuan mark. According to investigations, Ju Xing sold 950 bales, Yu Da 2,100 bales, Da Feng 1,550 bales, Geng Feng 2,250 bales, Xing Chang 1,550 bales, Yang Cheng 850 bales, Da Chang Cheng 1,050 bales, Run Kang 2,200 bales, Jing Hua 950 bales, Tong He 1,100 bales, He Xing 2,300 bales, and Tai Xing 900 bales. Da Ji bought 1,350 bales, Jin Chang 1,900 bales, Ming De 1,150 bales, Chang Ji 1,750 bales, Sen 950 bales, Shen Ji 2,400 bales, Chang Feng 1,400 bales, and Xin Cheng 1,550 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Decline More Moderate</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales were relatively active. According to statistics, all groups bought a total of 832 bales throughout the day, with prices falling by about 0.5 yuan. The buying volume of each group is listed below.</p>
<h3>Excessive Inventory, Rampant Rumors, Cotton Plunges One Yuan</h3>
<p>The dramatic fall in the cotton market, with its severe decline, is a rare occurrence in recent times. This situation is entirely due to the excessive inventory of coarse cotton, coupled with rumors that the cotton and wheat loan might be successfully concluded. As a result, sellers became increasingly active, making it difficult for the market to sustain itself. Forward contracts reportedly plummeted by one yuan.</p>
<p>Many Floating Longs Hastily Liquidating</p>
<p>At the opening of the cotton market this morning, the US cotton market recovered strongly, rising 1 to 6 points, while Indian cotton rose 0.05 to 1.25 rupees. Osaka's Three-Product Cotton rose 1.3 jiao. However, market sentiment was extremely weak, with a lack of buyers. Rampant rumors suggested that a compromise on the cotton and wheat loan was being reached, further intensifying selling pressure. The market gradually declined as it opened, with June, July, and August contracts all breaking the 40 yuan mark. As a result, all months fell by 0.35 to 0.5 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day. At the afternoon opening, the market outlook remained unfavorable. Many floating longs, recognizing the adverse environment, painfully liquidated their positions, causing the market price to plummet in a straight line. As a result, all months fell by 0.3 to 0.5 yuan compared to the morning closing price. The recent volatility and expansion of trading volume in the market, combined with the turbulent outlook, remain within the realm of alarming waves. According to investigations, Run Kang sold 6,400 dan, Xing Chang 1,700 dan, He Xing 4,200 dan, Da Feng 2,200 dan, Chang He 1,600 dan, Xin Chang 4,400 dan, Yi Kang 2,300 dan, Yi Chang 1,700 dan, Yuan Yi 1,700 dan, Geng Feng 7,200 dan, and Yu Da 3,700 dan.

<p>Spot Cotton Sales Can Be Described as Desolate</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is exceptionally stagnant, with factories closed. The source of Yao cotton is 280 bales, and Tonghua's source is 100 bales.</p>
<h3>Causes and Consequences of Recent Fluctuations in Standard Yarn and Cotton Over the Past Month</h3>
<p>Recently, the market conditions of standard yarn and cotton have been declining in a straight line, and the declining trend has become increasingly intense and fierce. In early March, favorable rumors circulated, and financial institutions, gold merchants, and securities firms absorbed large quantities, resulting in the highest price at the opening on April 14. The peak of September standard yarn reached 213.1 yuan, only 0.3 yuan lower than the merchant price on December 4 of the previous year. The peak of August standard cotton was 46 yuan, which was 0.1 yuan higher than the high price on December 4 of the previous year. Subsequently, due to sluggish real sales and weak purchasing power from customers, the daily increase in yarn inventory in yarn warehouses exceeded 31,000 bales. Although financial institutions invested and worked hard to purchase standard cotton, the transportation of coarse cotton from various routes to Shanghai increased the inventory to 80,000 to 90,000 dan. At this time, factories lacked sufficient needs for this coarse cotton. At the same time, the Indian cotton purchased by Chinese and foreign factories arrived in Shanghai one after another, with more than 50,000 pieces. Factories can use it temporarily, and there is no urgent need to purchase raw materials. Therefore, the cotton market turned sharply downward, and the cotton market weakened, and the yarn market became even more depressed. The biggest reason is that the smuggling in North China is becoming more and more prosperous, which has a great impact on cotton yarn. Although there is no actual cloth transported in large quantities, the sales of yarn have been greatly reduced. According to the investigation, at this time last year, the purchase of various yarns in the north was as much as 12,000 bales. Therefore, general short sellers were very active, and drastic changes occurred. The market fell sharply. Standard yarn fell sharply by 10.07 yuan in the near month and 11.5 yuan in the far month compared with the high price on April 14. Standard cotton fell sharply by 2.65 yuan in the near month and 3.2 yuan in the far month. The recent high and low prices of standard yarn and cotton are excerpted below.</p>
<h3>8,000 Bales of Indian Cotton Arrive</h3>
<p>More Than 10,000 Bales Are About to Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>8,000 bales of Indian cotton were transported by the British company's ferry Telet from Mumbai the day before yesterday (5th). There is still a batch of about 10,000 bales, which are transported by another ship and are already on the way. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai around the 14th of this month. It is heard that the cotton is handled by a certain Japanese merchant on Sichuan Road. Because the ship is docked at the river pier, the goods are picked up on the side of the ship, and the merchant finds a warehouse to store it.</p>
<p>Statistics on the Volume of Foreign Cotton Stored in this City</p>
<h3>Two Private Estimates of US Cotton</h3>
<p>A New York telegram on the 6th reported that the Panque and Liang announced that the estimated cotton field for this year was 32,140,000 acres, and the previous (April 1) was 32,970,000 acres. The Commercial Daily estimated the cotton field to be 30,990,000 acres, and the first time (April 2) was 31,140,000 acres.</p>
<h3>Overseas Cotton Markets Rise Slightly in Unison</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market was sluggish and firm. In the early morning, foreign political and financial uncertainties caused great anxiety. Later, Liverpool's interest rate was good, foreign merchants bought new cotton, and colleagues bought old cotton, and the market price rose. When the price of the May contract was 0.00023 yuan at 1.523 yuan, the cotton storage office sold it, and cotton farmers also had negative sales, but the number was small and all were absorbed. In the afternoon, some people sold new cotton in sets, and colleagues and foreign merchants specialized in buying the July contract. The current need is calm. The cloth market is dim but firm. As a result, spot goods rose by 1 pound, and futures rose by 1 to 7 pounds. The spot price of English cotton rose by 3 points, and the futures rose by 4 points. Indian cotton shifted from the near to the far month and speculative buying. When longs closed out and cotton merchants made cross-sales, the Ping Guo Er rose by 0.005 to 1 rupee, the Aomu La rose by 1.25 to 1.75 rupees, and the Bai Luo Xi rose by 0.75 to 1.25 rupees. The original telegram recorded left, (telegram on the 6th)</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Mumbai, the opening forecast for the Bai Luo Xi cotton for the July and August period on the 7th was 200 rupees, an increase of 0.625 rupees compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Osaka's Three Products of Yarn and Cotton Rose Slightly</h3>
<p>An Osaka telegram on the 7th reported that the price of yarn for the third product increased by 0.1 to 0.9 yuan. The price for the near month was 196.4 yuan, and the price for the far month was 195.1 yuan. The price of cotton futures increased by 0.1 to 0.3 yuan. The price for the near month was 64.45 yuan, and the price for the far month was 59.25 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Standard Yarn and Cotton Plunge, Cotton Cloth Suffers Setbacks</h3>
<p>In recent days, cotton cloth has shown good signs due to the development of actual sales and the firmness of yarn and cotton. Unexpectedly, yesterday, standard yarn and cotton underwent major changes again, and market prices plummeted in a straight line. Cotton cloth suffered a setback, and the market was bleak. Passenger sales were more cautious and hesitant. It is reported that about 100 pieces of 12-pound fine cloth from the Shi Longtou and Caiqiu brands, etc., and 30 bales of Shenxin 16-pound Siping Lian coarse twill from the Tianjin gang entered. In addition, Fujian, Guangdong, the Yangtze River and other places also added some scattered summer goods and white goods, but the number was small and the selling plate was average.</p>
<h3>Food: Large Households Absorb at Unlimited Prices, Flour Rises Sharply by Five or Six Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw huge fluctuations in each month's contracts at the opening in the morning. Transactions were smooth, and the rise and fall of the market was unbelievable. This situation was like a state of speculative frenzy. When the price was opened, the quotation for foreign wheat was only a few cents and the difference of 0.1 to 0.2 yuan, so the opening price for June fell to 2.9575 yuan. However, the reaction started from this. Due to the difficulty in selling flour in June, large long households suddenly started to absorb it smoothly and bought at unlimited prices, so the prices of each month were agitated and rose sharply. The first good prices were 0.0235 yuan, and the half-day transaction reached more than 900,000 bags. Forced to open in the afternoon, the price of June continued to be bought by large households, and the momentum was very strong, so some short sellers were eager to cover their positions, and the factory shorts also turned silent, so the opening price was higher and higher, and the closing price of June rose to 3.0425 yuan, which was an increase of 0.08 to 0.09 yuan compared to the opening price in the morning. The rest also rose by 0.03 to 0.05 yuan compared to the previous day. The competition between the two parties may lead to a chaotic situation in the future.</p>
<h3>Wheat Prices Also Rose with the Flour Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the opening of the wheat futures market showed an initial flatness and then a rising trend in each month's contracts. At the opening price, the quotation for foreign wheat was 0.1 to 0.2 yuan higher in Chicago and 0.04 yuan lower in Canada, so although the price of June once fell to 4.22 yuan, since the opening of July, the opening price was high due to the rise in the flour market. In the later stages, due to the rising trend in the flour market, the buying sentiment was strong, and the short households also covered their positions, so the price increased by 0.03 to 0.06 yuan. When the price was opened in the afternoon, the price of each month increased by 0.03 to 0.05 yuan compared to the morning due to the continuous rise in the flour market, and the price was 0.07 to 0.1 yuan higher than the previous day. Before the new wheat is seen, the price is not constant and there is little basis. This is something that speculators should pay attention to. The spot wheat market sees few transactions, and the price shouted is 0.1 yuan, and only 300 to 400 bags are traded.</p>
<h3>Reliance on Inland Merchants for Purchase of Ke Xian Rice</h3>
<p>The Market Was Able to Avoid Falling</p>
<p>Yesterday's Ke Xian rice market saw the arrival of goods without end, and the price of river rice fell step by step. The hoarding households had the intention of devaluing the price and selling it. The market situation was even softer, but the inland merchants took advantage of this sluggishness to inquire about the prices of rough rice at the market, and the market was able to stabilize. It is estimated that 276 bags of Gan late rough rice, 100 bags of Taizhou early rice, 192 bags of Han rough rice, and 540 bags of Wenzhou rough rice were processed. Also, 300 bags of Siamese rough rice were processed. Only 1,050 bags of Gan machine rice and 300 bags of Taizhou willow rice were processed in this street, but the market has been stabilized.</p>
<h3>Thick Rice and Thin Rice Continued to Fall by a few Jiao</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, each gang had slightly more sources than before, with a total of more than 30 stores and more than 7,000 shi of goods, so although the market finally recovered, the price of thick early japonica rice continued to be lowered by a few jiao. The Tianjin Longkou gangs for thin rice buns still only handled 600 to 700 bags, so the market price of thin rice also fell again by a few jiao. Beiyang sharp cut one jiao, except for changing yuan without honor or disgrace.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, more than 30 river gangs came by boat. The appetite for various goods in the market was still weak. The high-quality white japonica rice price was stable, and the medium- and low-quality rice price was short by nearly one jiao. The Du Jian goods were rare, and the price was fixed. The thin rice was stable, the high-quality Yang Jian material was stable, the medium- and low-quality rice price was soft, and the port passenger rice was also soft. The prices of the remaining goods all had a downstream trend.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: The Instability of the French Franc Makes it More Difficult for Chinese Silk to be Exported to France</h3>
<p>The French franc has fallen sharply in the past two days, and the exchange rate has not yet stabilized, so silk shops are very hesitant, people are disappointed, and transactions are sparse. With the increase in the discount rate for French exchange, it will be more difficult for Chinese silk to be exported to France. The price of Shanghai Silk B grade silk in the New York silk market fell yesterday, and the price of Japanese silk 83rd grade also continued to fall by about 0.02 yuan, so the Shanghai silk market was once excited, but it was silent again yesterday.</p>
<h3>The United Kingdom Increases Import Tax on Chinese Tea, and the Tax on Each Pound of Group Tea is Two and a Half Pence</h3>
<p>The British government recently promulgated an increase in the import tax on Chinese coarse tea, which is 2.5 pence per pound, which is equivalent to an additional 16 yuan per dan of Chinese currency. According to the coarse tea from Hubei, Hunan, Fuzhou and other routes, which is of the same grade as Indian and Ceylon tea, the purpose of the British government's increase in the import tax on Chinese tea is to develop the tea industry in the territory and restrict the sales of Chinese tea. The black tea from Qimen, Fuliang, and Zhude in China has special qualities and does not conflict with Indian and Ceylon tea, and is not subject to additional tax.</p>
<h3>A Large Number of New Green Tea from Local Tea Merchants Enter the Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, more than 200 boxes of new styles of Zhenmei green tea from local tea merchants were put out in tea shops such as Gongsheng, Yongsheng, Changsheng, and Shengyuan. Tongfu, Xiehe and other shops all purchased them, and the price was opened at 78 yuan to 85 yuan. More than 30 local tea manufacturers have started work, and the market is very lively.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Car White Shows a Slight Turn for the Better</h3>
<p>More Than 1,300 Bags of Branch Red Were Opened Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday, the trend of the sugar market showed a slight turn for the better, with signs of recovery. The association drew a disk, and the spot goods, re-export goods, and Dong Chibai, such as 24 coarse sand white, all maintained their original prices, while No. 4 Dong White re-export goods rose by 0.05 yuan and were drawn out at 6.75 yuan to 6.8 yuan for 600 to 700 bags. The local factory cotton white, such as Xinzhen, Jinxin, and Dahua, remained stable. The large batch of branch red that was reported the day before yesterday has been opened yesterday, with a total of more than 1,300 bags, and the price is 11.2 yuan. Because the goods are of different quality and the weather is warm and easy to change, the plate is also exchanged. Also, the Xinghua gang opened 30 bags of Dagong fenbai, and the price was 17.3 yuan.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Longkou Noodles Rise by 0.4 to 0.5 Yuan</h3>
<p>Recently, Longkou line noodles and dried noodles have continued to open, and the price is 24.3 to 24.4 yuan, which is an increase of 0.3 to 0.4 yuan compared with the previous plate, so the street plate is also tight. The northern standard has been sold for 24.5 to 24.8 yuan, and the southern standard (9-skin) has been sold for 23.5 yuan, both rising by about 0.5 yuan. The sales fields of passenger gangs and this street are also more active, but land prices are firm and there is not much change.</p>
<h3>Zhangzhou Branch Round Flowers and Seedlings are Flourishing</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a customer from Zhangzhou said that the lychee, longan and flower seedlings in that place are now extremely lush. If the situation is good and there are no obstacles, then this year's new goods will be very abundant, but the old goods are indeed limited, lychee dried has been cut off, and only a few small-sized goods of longan remain.</p>

<h3>A'fa</h3>
<p>— Jiang Jing</p>
<p>A long time ago, the villagers said that the yellow cow was A'fa's wife.</p>
<p>Many people asked A'fa: "Did you marry the yellow cow as your wife?" But A'fa, as always, opened his small eyes hostilely, snorted, and walked away.</p>
<p>No one knew where A'fa was from or what his background was; he had been here for more than ten years and was now in his fifties. It was said that he came as a beggar at first, and then found odd jobs to do, so he settled down. The year before last, he had a serious illness and could no longer work, so he had to work as a cowherd at Ru De Gong's house.</p>
<p>He was short and thin, with many scars on his scabby head; a particularly large one was on his right cheek, pulling his face tightly and distorting it. His eyes were as small as a mouse's, but when he looked at people, they flashed with a snake-like vicious light; his nostrils were very flat, as if they had been pressed by something. This ugly and humble appearance and the dirty color gave people a disgusting impression. "This guy must have been conceived by a monkey, or else he was scraped out of some latrine." People joked about him like this, not treating him as a human being; naughty children even gave him the nickname "monkey spawn" and often shouted it behind his back recklessly.</p>
<p>A'fa never resisted the contempt, ridicule, or even insults of others with actions or words; he always avoided eye contact and remained silent, only a vicious and resentful light flashed in his dark eyes, as if his heart was being tormented by some poison. He would immediately walk away quietly, never looking back, as if ashamed to stand with them. Some people said that he used to fight and scold people, but he suffered too much, and then he became like this.</p>
<p>But people ridiculed and insulted him even more because of this, and at the same time, they all hated him. No one regarded him as a companion or a friend, and no one said a word to him that should be said between people; they just made fun of him.</p>
<p>"Our Brother A'fa... Haha..."</p>
<p>A'fa never interacted with people and never spoke to them; he only used the simplest questions and answers with his master, Ru De Gong! "What? Yes, um." It seemed that A'fa thought that humans were all malicious animals that could not be approached. He not only deliberately avoided everyone, but also deliberately avoided everything related to people; his ugly face was always rigid, and no human expressions of joy, anger, sorrow, or happiness could be found. People couldn't guess what his heart was like.</p>
<p>However, he showed some kindness to me exceptionally. There were quite a few opportunities for conversations between us, but his words were always very short, no more than five or six sentences at most.</p>
<p>Once, I [missing text] people's opinions. He stared at me silently for a while, and then said coldly in a firm tone:</p>
<p>"They are all... ghosts! They can't afford me, and I despise them even more!"</p>
<p>In this world, the only thing he loved was that yellow cow. He cut grass, bathed it, caught lice for it, and washed its eyes with cold water every day. He did these things with great effort and was so happy that he often hummed some tunes that he himself didn't know.</p>
<p>The cow grew fatter and stronger day by day, but he answered people's praise for it with angry eyes.</p>
<p>He couldn't leave his cow for a moment. He had to follow it when plowing the fields; he always looked at it with eyes full of infinite affection, and sometimes he would smile ecstatically. When herding the cow, he was not with others. He took it to places where no one was and returned very late. But this caused even more rumors, and people said in [missing text] tones:</p>
<p>"Our Brother A'fa is still a virgin!"</p>
<p>But all the rumors and laughter did not harm his feelings for the cow in the slightest.</p>
<p>One summer evening, I saw A'fa and the cow on the edge of the mulberry forest by the field where no one could see them; at this time, the fields were quiet and there was no one there, only the sound of the cow eating grass could be heard. A'fa stood next to the cow, looking at it quietly with a greedy look, sometimes smiling, as if he was having some sweet memories. He often stroked the cow's back and neck gently—stroking it for a long time, making a low, blurred, intoxicated sound in his throat. The cow seemed very comfortable, raised its head, and wagged its tail obediently; at this time, A'fa laughed hee hee.</p>
<p>"Um, you [missing text]—" He patted it gently on the back: "What is it for? Eat."</p>
<p>But the cow started to eat the crops in the field. A'fa anxiously lifted its mouth and tapped its nose with his fingers, teaching it like a child:</p>
<p>"Um, you... why are you so greedy? It's better to eat grass." He stared at it, with an unspeakable enthusiasm in his eyes. "Um, eat! What good tender grass!" He smiled.</p>
<p>But the yellow cow still wanted to eat the crops. It [missing text] A'fa argued; A'fa pulled it hard, and the yellow cow shook its head and kept panting.</p>
<p>"Hey, hey, what are you doing? —What?" A'fa became anxious and raised the cow's mouth high again: "Are you angry with me? —" His voice became dejected, and his face showed a painful expression: "Are you angry with me? Are you? —Why?"</p>
<p>The cow didn't [missing text] shake its head anymore, but tried hard [missing text] to shrink its neck back, its nostrils [missing text] ; "Are you really angry with me?" His voice [missing text] was completely trembling. He suddenly [missing text] his hand and cried.</p>
<p>At first, he covered his face and sobbed, but soon he put down his hand and picked up the cow rope again. The cow lowered its head and didn't eat the crops, like a person regretting something. At this time, A'fa suddenly became happy and laughed ecstatically. He squatted down and smelled its nose, and stroked its eyes:</p>
<p>"Okay," he said, "let's make peace, and everyone don't be angry. —Here, eat, or you'll be hungry!" He wiped his tears while smiling.</p>
<p>Last year, Ru De Gong sold the yellow cow without A'fa's knowledge. When A'fa knew that his beloved yellow cow had left him forever, he was stunned and shed tears silently. A month later, he also died.</p>
<h3>Trembling Heartstrings</h3>
<p>— Jiang Jiping</p>
<p>Paper Flowers</p>
<p>The weather is so sunny that it is very pleasant, but there is a bit of wind, which is a bit of a regret in spring. There is also a lot of wind in the yard, but this wind is definitely not as uncomfortable as the wind in winter. This wind seems to have a bit of poetry. When you hear the sound of this wind, you will think of the ancient poet's line: "The spring breeze is ten miles of Yangzhou Road." Although the spring breeze now will not be so gentle, it can always make people feel a little drunk. Although there are only a few old clothes drying in the yard, when they are swayed by the breeze, that kind of posture under the spring sun feels an indescribable beauty. The children tore up a lot of red and green handmade paper, a pile here and a few pieces there, which really looks a bit like the remnants of flowers and fallen leaves that have been destroyed by wind and rain and fallen on the ground. After a while, the wind blew the paper scraps on the ground to the two pots of dead branches of the rose flowers. From a distance, the red paper scraps are sandwiched in the middle of the rose branches, which really looks like the dead roses are blooming again. I am very happy in my heart, although I know it is fake, but then what in the world is not fake, but this kind of happy feeling is always rare.</p>
<p>Thinking of Magnolia</p>
<p>I don't know why I suddenly thought of magnolia, and also thought of things from a long time ago. At that time in Qingdao, I went to the trestle bridge in the evening. The person walking in front was one of my female classmates, with two magnolias slanted in her hair. The wind was warm, and the fragrance of the magnolias evaporated. The feeling at that time was as if I had just opened a bottle of very good port wine, and smelled the mouth of the bottle. I was already a little intoxicated without drinking it in my mouth. We got off the trestle bridge and walked on the beach again. We sat quietly on the stones and looked at the lights across the bank. Facing a blue expanse, we looked at the distant market of cold stars on the other side. The emotions in our hearts immediately became tense, and the line "Two or three sparks are Guazhou" jumped in my mind again. That was already five years ago. Where has she gone now? Who knows? Why can't this scene at the time be erased? The sun has already set in the west, and a faint golden color is spread on the floor. For some reason, the room is different from the past. The books on the bookshelf and the books on the desk, I don't know who arranged them so neatly, and the calligraphy and paintings on the wall also seem much cleaner than in the past. Is it happy? There is also a bit of lonely disappointment. Zheng Banqiao's poem on the small strip hanging on the wall: "The heavy snow fills the world, why do you travel with a sword? If you want to talk about your heart, go to the tavern together." After reading this heroic poem, it seems that I should cheer up a bit, but I always feel weak and powerless. The setting sun is shining through the window, and the curtains are shaking gently. I feel like I have lost something, and I always feel a little disappointed.</p>

<h3>Talking about "Mass Recitation"</h3>
<p>— Quan Lin</p>
<p>The countries where "mass recitation" first became popular were the Soviet Union and Germany. The first person to introduce it to the United States was M. Goldt, who believed that this was the most powerful method in mass culture and a most practical art. In his published "A Collection of Twelve Million Ones," he collected several pieces of this kind of material. He worked hard to promote this movement in the United States and encouraged American writers to write more of this kind of literature.</p>
<p>The form of "mass recitation" is like this: using the most concise and stimulating words, it is written into a kind of short and powerful operatic form of duet, chorus, and solo, and performed by a number of people (about twenty or at most thirty) together with music. This must be singable and fit the concise musical rhythm. Needless to say, each sentence must be very short and have the power of a bullet. Reading it out forcefully and unhurriedly with correct and clear articulation, so that every word can convey a kind of stimulation to the audience, of course, some exciting materials are needed here, so some realistic romantic components are necessary.</p>
<p>The biggest feature of "mass recitation" is that the actors do not have to perform entirely on stage. Several actors wear the same clothes as the audience and mix among the audience. There is no need for makeup and painting faces. Their task is to chorus or shout loudly offstage. To give an example, in Goldt's "Strike," a "wealth" and a "poverty" are dueting on stage.</p>
<p>Wealth (with a face obsessed with inner desires, a fat person)—Who are you? Have you ever been invited?</p>
<p>Poverty—(A ragged woman) (calmly) I have not been invited.</p>
<p>Wealth—Then why are you here? Get out! You dirty woman!</p>
<p>Poverty—I am poverty, your sister, wherever you go, I go.</p>
<p>Wealth—(Angrily) Nonsense! Nonsense! Poverty is not my sister.</p>
<p>Poverty—(Calmly) Greed is our father.</p>
<p>Wealth—(Shouting) Get out! Ragged woman! My brother calls</p>
<p>Poverty—(Coldly) You are used to dealing with me in this way! ...</p>
<p>Here, the men are a unit, the women are another unit, and the chorus of many people is another unit. Later, a young leader is discovered in the crowd, and he duets with those on and off the stage. At the end, several actors offstage rush onto the stage from the side of the stage. This scene of "mass recitation" ends in a tragic and uplifting shout and chorus.</p>
<p>This method obviously gives the audience a great stimulus. They often instinctively become one with the actors and shout along with them. Goldt once said this about the performance of that "Strike":</p>
<p>"The audience was surprised: they didn't know who these people sitting next to them were—they were shouting and singing here and there—the sound of the drama seemed to come from the people next to them. So the workers and those people joined together and shouted exciting slogans and rushed to the side of the stage. The audience was gradually surrounded by the excitement around them. They became one of the actors, they became the 'real masses' in the drama. At the end of that 'mass recitation,' everyone in the pool was shouting."</p>
<p>Let's think about how tragic and uplifting that scene was! What an effective literature this is!</p>
<p>The second feature of mass recitation is that it is very simple. At first glance, it seems troublesome to need twenty or thirty actors and music, but it is unexpectedly simple! First, it does not need a magnificent stage and scenery. Any gathering place of the masses can be used, even outdoors, as long as there is a simple stage and a few tables and benches. Second, except for two or three people who play nobles, police, etc., who need simple makeup, all the other actors do not need makeup or costume changes. This is easier to plan than Tai Fuxi's "open-air drama."</p>
<p>Regarding music, it is naturally best to have it, but I think Chinese music is very underdeveloped, or only a violin or piano is enough for the first trial performance.</p>
<p>This kind of "mass recitation" needs a very energetic director, whose task is even more important than the director in a drama. The actors must carefully memorize and match the very correct rhythm and spacing. The director must pay attention to avoiding confusion due to excessive excitement—this is easy to offend in the first trial performance.</p>
<p>The third feature of mass recitation is that it can unite the strong will of the audience (Saedarilz). It is like a powerful speech. It can uniformly motivate the audience. There is no individualism, no leading actor and supporting actor, every actor is equally important. And more meaningful is that it can turn this performance into the audience's own performance and turn this "mass recitation" into the masses' own thing. What a powerful way to make backward masses accept the mission of literature and art!</p>
<h3>Daughter-in-law</h3>
<p>— Hua Sha</p>
<p>Early morning—it was the early morning of my third day in Nantou Town. The sun had just emerged from the red glow on the horizon, behind the village on the opposite bank of the river, its fat face flushed. The fields were calm and clear, and although it was early spring, people already felt comfortable and warm.</p>
<p>I don't know how many wheelbarrows, piled high with firewood and tree roots, "creaked, rumbled!" as they heavily rolled down from the small stone bridge on the left and passed in front of the school gate. In such a beautiful early morning, I took a pair of overshoes covered in mud and walked towards the river. The muddy yellow river water slowly flowed downstream. A small, thin woman stood on a square stone that was exposed to the surface of the water, holding two pieces of wet clothes. She was laboriously crossing from the square stone to the river beach, slowly climbing ashore, looking as if she was about to fall. Her hair was frighteningly disheveled on her face, so that people could only see her flat nose and pouting little mouth. When she was about to stand up straight, she saw me and smiled at me strangely, revealing her big yellow teeth:</p>
<p>"Are you washing your shoes? Um, um, you are welcome to come and play at my house when you have time!"</p>
<p>The woman spoke to me unexpectedly. I thought she might be the mother of a primary school student in the school, or perhaps she was a postpartum woman who had just given birth. So I smiled and asked her:</p>
<p>"Then where is your home?"</p>
<p>She pointed with the stick in her hand and said, "It's over there."</p>
<p>My gaze followed her stick and I saw a rectangular thatched house on that side:</p>
<p>"Oh! I'll come to see you when I'm free."</p>
<p>She walked away without looking back, separating her bare little feet and walking as slowly as a cart driver pushing a cart.</p>
<p>From then on, whenever I walked past the door that the woman had pointed out, I paid attention to her. She always sat on the small wooden stool in front of the door, cleaning some vegetables or washing clothes, her movements were slow, and she was always [missing text]. Moreover, she never raised her face.</p>
<p>Soon, I finally found an opportunity to see the woman and a twelve or thirteen-year-old girl digging in the mud in the square, looking for something in the mud and throwing it towards the wax-yellow ducklings. The ducks were staggering and scrambling. The girl used a pair of bamboo chopsticks to clamp something and threw it to where the woman was sitting. I really wanted to know what they were doing, so I walked up to her; I only saw many earthworms crawling beside her feet, but she lowered her head as if she hadn't spoken to me, picking the earthworms into sections and then throwing them at the ducks. Her hands were dirty and greasy, ignoring how the earthworms wriggled on her fingers, and still shaking her wooden-like arms as she picked them up.</p>
<p>"Hey! Aren't you afraid of goosebumps doing this?" She didn't seem to hear my words.</p>
<p>"Can't you just give them the whole thing to eat?"</p>
<p>She still didn't answer me, but lowered her head even more, her bare toes moving restlessly in the mud.</p>
<p>I didn't know why she was so indifferent as she slowly paced around the square. A little duck stretched its neck, shook its head, and half an earthworm hung outside its mouth. Seeing this, the girl called out angrily, "You stupid woman! Don't pick them shorter! I'll tell Mom!" But I didn't see the girl move, so I strode out of the square.</p>
<p>After that, I saw the woman every day, holding a small bamboo pole and sitting on the bank of the river opposite, her feet hanging over the river, the river water slowly flowing under her feet. A flock of goslings pecked at the green grass on the grass beside her. Sometimes I saw the woman swinging her feet as if admiring the beauty of nature, gently tapping the grass with the bamboo pole, sometimes staring fixedly at the house opposite. When I walked back to my residence across the small wooden bridge every day, I would definitely pass by her side, and because I had never received her answer, although I really wanted to ask her, I never did.</p>
<p>A few days passed again. One day, when I was walking next to her, she smiled at me again and asked me:</p>
<p>"Are you going back?"</p>
<p>"Yes, going back," I said, pausing slightly beside her. Suddenly she pointed to the school opposite and said:</p>
<p>"What are you doing there?"</p>
<p>"Teaching," I said.</p>
<p>She looked up at me, and smiled again in disbelief and fear. At this time, from her legs with her trousers rolled up high, I saw patches of blue-purple and bloodstains. The instep of her feet was shiny and swollen, and her neck was full of scratches. It was clear that she had been injured. So I thought again that in her blue rag clothes, there might be more scars that I wouldn't see. So I asked:</p>
<p>"What's on your legs?"</p>
<p>She frowned at me, and then replied indifferently:</p>
<p>"The mother-in-law hit me."</p>
<p>"What about on your neck?"</p>
<p>"The girl scratched me."</p>
<p>"Where is your husband?"</p>
<p>"Gone."</p>
<p>From her simple answer, I couldn't hear any resentment or pain. I was surprised by her indifferent expression. I wanted to know what she needed.</p>
<p>"Have you had lunch?"</p>
<p>"I don't eat it."</p>
<p>"Do you have any copper coins..."</p>
<p>"Copper coins..."</p>
<p>"Have you ever been to the street?"</p>
<p>"Street..."</p>
<p>"Do you want to go to the city to play?"</p>
<p>"City..."</p>
<p>She repeated the two words as if she had never heard these words before, and she was thinking. Her voice "um um" in my ears like a fly, making people annoyed. Finally I said:</p>
<p>"The sun is going down soon, aren't you going back?"</p>
<p>"The girl hasn't come to call me yet." At this time, she was gently tapping the grass with the bamboo pole again, showing a very naive appearance.</p>
<p>A girl quickly ran from the opposite bank, this girl was the one I had seen in the square that day. She shouted before crossing the small bridge:</p>
<p>"Stupid woman! Go home!" The woman shrugged her shoulders in horror, slowly climbed up from the river bank, and took a pole with the girl and "Go go!" The geese were driven across the small bridge and went home.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, that woman and the geese would no longer appear on the other side of the river. I was surprised, I was shocked, and I deliberately walked back and forth in front of the woman's thatched house. The geese and ducks were still walking slowly in the square, the girl was still digging in the mud, but only the woman was missing. I wondered where she had gone.</p>
<p>It wasn't until evening that I saw the woman again, her forehead bandaged with a dirty cloth, blood flowing from the cloth layer on her forehead to her face. She used the bamboo pole for driving the geese to support her body, stumbling out of the thatched house. Her face was gray-yellow and swollen, and her feet moved forward like two thick pieces of wood. Suddenly, a woman in her forties or fifties rushed out of the thatched house, grabbed the stupid woman's shoulder, pulled her back fiercely, and said, "You dare to go out." The stupid woman fell to the ground. Stepping forward, I said to the old woman, "Why do you have to pull her like that?"</p>
<p>The old woman tilted her head towards me, and said to me with a more stern face:</p>
<p>"Miss, you have your business, this is not something you can manage. My daughter-in-law is a stupid woman, and she peed on the new bed three days after entering the house. Everyone in the town knows that."</p>
<p>"Since you know she's stupid, don't hit her. It's not right to hit her," I said.</p>
<p>"Hum! You know how to talk. I work hard to weigh firewood and can't earn much money, and you can send her to you to raise her," the woman said, dragging the stupid woman towards me, and shouting: "You can raise her, and I won't say anything else." I angrily pointed at the old woman and cursed "bastard," and then quickly walked out of the square.</p>
<h3>Lessons from the Fall of Abyssinia</h3>
<p>— Xiaoshan</p>
<p>The country of Abyssinia, with an area of only 900,000 square kilometers and a population of only 5,500,000 (in fact, the Abyssinian race has only 3 million people), supported its sacred war of resistance for seven months, but ultimately failed. On May 5th, the Abyssinian capital fell, and the fascist Mussolini's army of the imperialists finally occupied the entire country.</p>
<p>However, we dare not grieve for Abyssinia, but we have learned several lessons from this war. The first is the mutual exclusion and aggression between imperialists. The League of Nations, supported by Britain, disintegrated invisibly, and the "collective security" that once caused a sensation has now completely become a bubble. Following the development of this condition, the period of great tragedy for humanity is approaching even more urgently. But we don't need to be afraid, the pain of the imperialists themselves is unimaginable, and it cannot be compensated by obtaining one or two colonies, just as Italy's invasion of Abyssinia mobilized the whole country, sacrificing money, lives, and property. Even if they get Abyssinia, their vitality cannot be restored. Therefore, the great tragedy of humanity will unfold even more seriously. The second lesson is that the weak nations of the world all understand that sacred struggle is great and will be victorious. The reason for Abyssinia's failure is of course material backwardness and being outnumbered. A small, unassisted country can still withstand eight months of imperialist massacre, and the whole country is united, resisting until the entire country is tragically submerged. This shows how great the wars of small and weak nations are. If the small and weak nations of the world, based on this profound lesson, form a great iron fortress, we believe that the imperialists, even in eight years... cannot subdue the small nations of the world.</p>
<p>Looking back at our China, we have an area of 11,173,558 square li and a population of 450 million, which is far different from Abyssinia. The population of Abyssinia is only the population of Shanghai, and it can resist for eight months. Therefore, the lesson we learned from Abyssinia is that Abyssinia's failure is glorious. They died for struggle, they perished for struggle. We must accept this great lesson!</p>
<p>Special Feature</p>
<h3>Mr. Lu and Mr. Ye Detail the Invention Process of the Rotary Tri-Purpose Light Bulb</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Messrs. Lu Zhongwen and Ye Liang, our countrymen, have invented a "rotary tri-purpose light bulb" that is different from ordinary ones. Yesterday afternoon, the reporter visited them, and they told us a lot about the invention process.</p>
<p>Messrs. Lu and Ye were originally engineers at a foreign merchant's light bulb factory. After resigning, they felt that the existing light bulbs were simple and not durable. After more than two years of careful research, they successfully tested the "rotary" light bulb.</p>
<p>The "rotary tri-purpose light bulb" has two types. One type has three filaments inside the bulb, each emitting a different light intensity. The top filament is 5 candlepower, the middle filament is 25 candlepower, and the bottom filament is 50 candlepower. The key to changing the light intensity is a specially made rotating copper head. When it is inserted, it is 5 candlepower. When rotated, the second filament lights up, changing it to 25 candlepower. When rotated again, the third filament lights up, changing it to 50 candlepower. This is like buying three light bulbs of different intensities.</p>
<p>There is also another type, which also has three filaments, but all three filaments have the same light intensity. When the first filament breaks, simply rotate the special copper head, and the second filament can still emit light. When the second filament breaks, rotate the copper head again, and the third filament can still emit light. It cannot be used until both filaments are broken. In this way, it is as if one light bulb is used as three light bulbs.</p>
<p>There are two complete models of the light bulb, which are placed in the Ministry of Industry in Nanjing for registration. The only one that I was able to see was a light bulb that had not yet been fitted with a copper head. The glass shell was flat and round, and there were three filaments inside the glass shell, top, middle, and bottom. As for the copper head? It is said to be completely different from ordinary ones, with a thick texture and a spiral shape. There are four protruding feet at the bottom that are embedded in the glass shell, so that it will not be impossible to insert it during rotation. At the top of the copper head, the ordinary ones have two egg-shaped tin blocks, while theirs have three very small tin points. There is also a hook-shaped thing next to it, and the change of the filament during rotation happens on it. The color of the copper head is chrome-plated.</p>
<p>Later, there will also be a two-purpose light bulb, which can change between two light intensities.</p>
<p>In terms of price, because the structure is slightly more complicated and the cost is higher, the selling price will be slightly more expensive than ordinary ones. It is probably above 30 cents and below 40 cents. The two-purpose one may be cheaper.</p>
<p>The electricity consumption is the same as ordinary ones, and perhaps a wattmeter will be used to test it for everyone in the future.</p>
<p>This "rotary tri-purpose light bulb" has been applied to the Ministry of Industry for a five-year patent. Cantonese merchant Mr. Chen Weizhou has invested in setting up the "Central Tri-Purpose Light Bulb Factory" on Rue Sa-po-sai, with a total capital of 90,000 yuan in the first phase. It has now ordered light bulb making machines from the China Rongchang Factory.</p>
<p>In terms of raw materials, except for the filaments and copper heads, which are American goods, the rest are domestic goods.</p>
<p>The assembly of the machines will be completed in about two weeks. Formal business must wait until there is a considerable inventory. The future measurement is four to five thousand pieces per day.</p>
<p>The main production processes in their factory are as follows: core,燙鈎[unknown], 綳絲 [unknown], medicinal powder, sealing, exhausting air, 校光 [unknown], copper head, stamping, final light inspection, packaging.</p>
<p>Finally, Messrs. Lu and Ye led me to see the factory building that was being assembled, which was a small Western-style building, all the way up and down. The craftsmen were still working hard, and some small machines were already placed there.</p>
<p>After leaving, I felt very happy, because it is always a good thing for our countrymen to invent more, no matter how big or small!</p>
<h3>Cotton-Picking Women</h3>
<p>— Dongguang</p>
<p>In mid-September, the sorghum and corn were harvested. On the ochre land, there were only patches of snow-like cotton fields. In summer, the stems of the cotton seedlings are dark purple. The autumn wind blows the leaves yellow, and they roll and fly on the plains. The stems and branches also turn ochre. The bolls open like small bird claws, grasping handfuls of white flowers. Under the gray sky, it is unexpectedly spacious. In each cotton field, there is a small woven grass hut, and there is an elderly farmer who is loyal to his duty. He wears a white sheepskin robe, holds a pipe like a stone statue, and patrols the edges of the land with a clumsy musket on his back, guarding the harvest for the owner...</p>
<p>The night, accompanied by the barking of dogs, drifted across the bank of the small river. The water flowed gurglingly under the single-plank bridge. The ferry boat glided across the river and drifted back and forth. At this time, groups of women picking cotton returned. They carried bulging, huge bundles on their backs, bending their bodies, and moved under the bundles, walking in rows from the field ridges. Along the river slope, they walked to the head of the wooden bridge, happily threw the large cotton bales to the ground, raised their faces and breathed a sigh of relief, and sat down on the cotton bales. They waited for the ferry to row across the shore with a creaking sound. They hobbled on their pointy feet, dragged the large cotton bales onto the boat, and then squatted down happily, asking each other about the weight and price:</p>
<p>"How many coppers per ten catties do you get from picking for Sanxingtang?"</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>"Two big coppers (i.e., four small coppers)."</p>
<p>"We get three and a half small coppers. I won't pick for the Ma family tomorrow."</p>
<h3>Mr. Zhang Shutong's Recent Work (Yu Mountain Scenery)</h3>
<p>These are all young women and girls. In autumn, small households finish their own work, and the men go to the wilderness to collect firewood. The women go to pick cotton for the landlords. They go to the cotton fields from the end of July to pick "one spray" (that is, when the entire cotton field is full of cotton) and then "one spray" again. They work hard, wiping away large beads of sweat, under the scorching sun and in the early autumn evening wind, busy without wanting to say a word of idle talk, until it gets dark. Then they carry large bundles of cotton bales on their backs—all picked by their non-stop hands that day. Although it is so heavy that it bends their backs, they are not afraid of it at all. Sometimes they even hate that it is not heavier. — Crossing the river, a group of women are followed by the "manager" of the landlord's family, a gentle gentleman in a long gown, holding a pair of shiny walnuts or a snuff bottle in his hand.</p>
<p>They jumped off the boat, carried their own bundles, and dragged themselves across a stretch of sand, panting with difficulty, and climbed the slope. The lights in the village were on, and the smoke from the cooking fires permeated the stars in the sky. A group of people walked towards the Ma family in the south of the village, and another group turned past the stockpiling yard—a red warning light had been lit on the mountain-like salt pile.</p>
<p>They were like a batch of flood victims, a dark, dense line, walking along the tall white lime wall, entering the gate of Sanxingtang, and carrying the cotton to be weighed according to the bamboo slips they received. The cotton bale was lowered from the large frame scale. The plumb line hit there, and the scale lever was raised high. The cotton-picking woman could only open her two fiery eyes and sigh, not daring to make a sound, waiting for the young man who pulled the scale lever to shout:</p>
<p>"Seventy catties!"</p>
<p>"I only have seventy catties?"</p>
<p>"How much? A hundred catties? Add you too."</p>
<p>Silently accepting the two sarcastic remarks, the accountant gave her the money, took back the slip, and another old witch-like woman came over and pulled her aside to search her pants to see if she had stolen a ball of cotton. After the search, she was quickly chased out of the gate.</p>
<p>On the way home, they counted the copper coins one by one, forgetting their fatigue and humiliation, thinking that the day's work was done, they could buy a foot of cloth, a large cake, or a packet of needles and a bundle of thread for the children or the younger brothers, always kind, simple, and spending a string of difficult days in the future.</p>
<h3>Sending Away the Dull Spirit</h3>
<p>— Fangzhou</p>
<p>—Gleanings of Local Customs—</p>
<p>The eastern half of the sky was burned red by the sun just climbing out of the horizon. A layer of golden brilliance had been sprinkled on the pine forest in front of the hillside. The warm air gradually surrounded Double Pagoda Village, and the water in the river beside Lotus Leaf Ridge was flowing quietly.</p>
<p>At breakfast time, a burst of noisy shouting and yelling came from the stone road in the distance. The village dogs were barking madly, jumping from east to west, as if they were crazy. This tranquil village was suddenly stirred up with unrest and commotion, and the noise was getting closer and closer, as if to shatter people's eardrums.</p>
<p>"They are sending away the dull spirit for Mo Afu's wife!" A'cai said, holding his rice bowl.</p>
<p>"Don't go out, don't go and bump into the dull spirit!" A'cai's mother told everyone not to go to watch, because if anyone bumped into the dull spirit, they would go mad like Mo Afu's wife—smashing furniture and hitting people.</p>
<p>However, the edge of the well in front of the teahouse and the area beneath the severed pagoda were eventually filled with a crowd of people, men, women, old, and young, all standing on tiptoe and looking towards the stone road.</p>
<p>Beside the bluestone bridge on the stone road, there was a cluster of young men, rushing together with "哗啦! 哗啦!" sounds. A large bronze gong was being struck with "瞠! 瞠!" sounds, hitting with the force of an earth tremor. Two young men were carrying a broken firewood enclosure, with Mo Afu's wife tied up like a piglet and put inside. Everyone crowded around, rocking and swaying her as they ran. In the mountains, beside the fields, along the streams they ran. Running, they would relentlessly shake the enclosure, sometimes rolling it down the mountainside at the mid-point of the slope, and then carrying it and running again after it rolled to flat ground, causing Mo Afu's wife to feel a terror as if the sky was collapsing and the earth was turning upside down, and great distress.</p>

<p>The Master said, "While his father is alive, observe his intentions; when his father is dead, observe his actions. If for three years he does not alter from the way of his father, he may be called filial."</p>
<p>Youzi said, "In the practice of ritual, harmony is prized. The way of the former kings prized this, and it was followed in all matters, great and small. Yet there is something that should not be done. To know harmony and yet to seek only harmony without regulating it by ritual, this is not permissible either."</p>
<p>Youzi said, "When trustworthiness is close to righteousness, words can be fulfilled. When courtesy is close to ritual, one keeps far from shame and disgrace. When one relies on those he should rely on, one can also have someone to rely on." The Master said, "The gentleman seeks not satiety in his food nor ease in his dwelling; he is diligent in his work but careful in his words. By associating with those who possess the Way, he rectifies himself. This may be called love of learning indeed."</p>

<p>China-West (1040) 1:00 PM to 1:45 PM</p>
<p>Opening: "Huo Dingjin's Private Hanging"</p>
<p>Pitiful cries call out to my husband in distress. My throat is choked, my mouth is mumbled. First I call "brother," then I slowly call "husband." People say I am crying for my aunt's husband. Fortunately, the two words "aunt's husband" are almost the same. I heard that we will meet on the third day of the first lunar month. I will be able to see you in the back garden. For more than a hundred days, my heart has been simple and filial. For you, I am willing to be a lowly slave. For you, I abandon my mother, and my heart is most bitter. For you, I was bewitched by the stolen Double Pearl Phoenix. Changed my surname, knelt down, and called you by your pet name. For you, I wandered in a foreign land, accompanied by a bookboy. For you, I never thought that you would achieve great success in your career. Returning home, there was a family feud. For you, I suffered disasters in prison. In just a few days, my life came to an end. I think my beauty is so ill-fated. In this world, ill-fated people like me are numerous. I only suffer because the literary family's thousand-year-old fire has been extinguished. I only grieve because the wife who has come from a thousand miles is mourning her husband. I still don't know that my ill fate has harmed you. I still don't know that I have burdened you and you have burdened me. Husband, I will never be a person who forgets affection when people are gone. I will never be a wife who shows no affection at all. I still remember your words before you left home. Choose a date to tie the knot. I think of you thousands of times a day. I have lost all news from Chang'an. My soul often dreams of your face. I asked a matchmaker to come to my door immediately. I hope to play the phoenix flute with you soon. I hope that your family will become famous as soon as possible. After you succeed in the imperial examinations, there will be more success. I don't think about tea and rice all day long. I cry so much that my tears flow like shuttles every day. I only said that you have forgotten our love and reason. I am willing to shave my head and recite the Buddha's name. Husband, I never knew that everything cannot be controlled by humans. My maternal uncle introduced me to another husband. From ancient times, a horse has only one saddle. A woman has never been married to two husbands. For you, I abandoned my parents in the hall. I fled secretly at night and traveled a long way. I suffered all kinds of hardships on the way. For you, I risked the capital with the crime of deceiving the emperor. For you, I was almost sitting on pins and needles. I was ordered to be an imperial envoy in Henan. The imperial envoy inspected the early three passes. Only then did I come to your spirit, and my heart lost its pain. Now, seeing your memorial tablet, I cry to death. What face do I have to go home? I will chase you to the Yellow Springs and accompany you. If you have a soul, please appear quickly. Tell me a wonderful plan for the world. I call out "brother," I cry out "husband." My broken throat can't say half a word. My crying makes three generations of ancestors cry together. The earth and grain are magical, and there are many traces of tears. My crying is endless. One cry for "young master," one cry for "husband." Even your heart of iron and stone would feel numb.</p>

<h3>Song and Dance Film "Flying Swallow Leans on New Makeup"</h3>
<p>Premiering Today at the Great Light</p>
<p>Warner Brothers is known for its song and dance films. Past works such as "Gold Diggers of Broadway," "Footlight Parade," and "42nd Street" have all been sensational. Now, their latest work, "Colleen," will premiere at the Great Light today (Friday). The male lead of the film is Dick Powell, and the female lead is Ruby Keeler, who is good at dancing. They can also be called old partners. In addition, there is the lively, round-eyed Joan Blondell, the hippie-smiling Jack Oakie, and Paul Trebe, the Broadway dance king who is as famous as Fred Astaire. With such a gathering of talents, competing to contribute their strengths, it is indeed worthy of attention. This film not only has grand song and dance scenes, but also the dance poses and the coordination of costumes are all brand new and unique. The director's design skills are also superhuman, especially in grasping the small details, naturally giving people hearty and cheerful laughter. There is also Warner's group of beautiful song and dance girls, most of them participating in the performance of new costume dances. In short, this is a new work that is rich in sound and color, and it is worth watching.</p>
<h3>"Les Misérables" Premieres in Paris</h3>
<p>"Les Misérables" is based on the French literary giant Hugo's masterpiece. The addition of the two golden-award-winning superstars, Fredric March and Charles Laughton, adds even more color to the film. The content is full of revolutionary frenzy, heroic blood, and is extremely tragic, enough to bring tears to even the stoniest of hearts. Starting today, it will be shown at the Paris Grand Theatre, and will be shipped to other cities after the screening. It is feared that people in Shanghai will not be able to see it again. Therefore, those who wish to see it, do not miss this last opportunity.</p>

<h3>"China Travel" Continues to Perform at the Carlton</h3>
<p>The China Traveling Theater Troupe has been performing plays such as "Camille," "Thunderstorm," "Mei Luo Xiang," "The Lady's Fan," and "The Paint is Not Dry" at the Carlton Theater for more than ten consecutive days, setting a new record for the public performance of dramas in Shanghai. It is now heard that the Carlton Theater is satisfied with the troupe's performance, and the box office has not declined, and has asked to continue the performances. Therefore, the troupe may perform new plays that have never been performed in Shanghai, such as "Heroes and Beauties," "The Net," "Ward No. 5," and "The Unfinished Masterpiece." It is said that "The Unfinished Masterpiece" is Tang Huaiqiu's specialty. The Diantong Company's "Peach and Plum Tribulation" was adapted from this play. The popularity during the performance is expected.</p>
<h3>Celebrity Fashion Exhibition</h3>
<p>The "Celebrity Bi-Monthly" magazine needed photographs of the spring outfits of several of these ladies. Ma Yonghua, the photographer, invited them to the studio on Avenue Albert at the same time. Under the lights, they were dressed in various styles of spring clothing. As one shot after another was taken, we felt as if we were attending a fashion exhibition.</p>
<p>Huang Naishuang, a red coat, a rose-colored cheongsam, both the coat and the cheongsam having a black border; Yuan Shaomei, a floral cheongsam, looking very fresh; Ying Yin, simple, a blue cheongsam, with a black cloth around her, a small checkered coat, healthy beauty matching the plain colors; Tan Ying, appearing in a Western style, a red top, a black skirt, and a pure white coat, very lively, very excited; Yan Yuexian's attire intertwined with black and white; Qiu Jin's outfit seemed to have appeared in "Peach and Plum Blossoms Compete for Beauty", a small checkered patterned cheongsam and coat; Gu Guanjun, that kind of bright color is very suitable for that lively and clever body.</p>
<p>There are still a few ladies who could not come today, or perhaps they will be photographed tomorrow.</p>
<h3>A Certain Film Organization Recruiting Male and Female Actors</h3>
