<p>（東京）我駐日大使許世英、奉政府令、於十一日下午五時、往訪日外相有田、會談的兩小時、許大使對我政府立塲、反覆說明、至爲誠摯、關於某某點希望日本充分瞭解、有田亦對日政府之見解、詳盡闡述、並允對許大使提出之點、重加考慮、此次會談、尚未達到完全諒解之程度（十一日中央電）</p>

<p>（南京）綏北已接觸、記者特爲此事往訪日大使館發言人松村書記官、詢以萬一該方面發生戰事、南京外交談判是否中止、松村答謂近日察綏軍事、乃中國正式軍隊與土匪間之事、完全爲中國內政問題、與日無關、故卽使該方面發生戰事、亦不致影響南京談判云、（十一日中央社電）</p>
<p>（南京）據日大使館發言入稱、張外長及川越第七次會談意見雖稍接近、然尚有數問題雙方主張距離仍遠、需要繼續洽商、此决交涉遷延時日已久、兩國政府似均希望迅謀解决、故在交涉未告一叚落前、川越大使不致離開南京云、（十一日中央社爾）</p>
<p>（南京）關於中日談判事、頃據某熱悉外交情形者談、自九月十五日張外長與日本川越大使開始交涉以來、爲時計近二月、會商亦達七决之多，其曲折艱難、不難想見、我張外長本政府旣定方針、努力折衝始終不渝、所幸日方漸能了解我方立塲、對某某數點、已不堅持、故在十日第七次會商中雙方意見略見接近、中日談判之內容、頭緒頗多、困難之點、亦尚不少、前途未許十分樂觀、我外交當局亦惟有堅守已定政策、以求貫澈我方意志、（十一日專電）</p>

<h3 id="c52">中山先生誕辰紀念 <a href="#c52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>今天是中山先生的誔辰紀念。中山先生是中國革命黨的創造者。同時又是中華民國的創造者。中山先生有的是。一貫而博大的革命主義。不屈不撓再接再厲的革命精神和大公無私的偉大人格。中山先生能够接受歷史上可包貴的敎訓。隨着客觀事實的需要。不斷地充實其革命主義和革命方略的內容。中山先生四十年來所倡導的國民革命。直到現在。仍舊是中國革命問題的主題。中山先生的革命主義和遺敎。直到現在。還深深地印入在中國人民的腦海裏。我們只見到。中山先生炯炯的眼光和偉大而崇高的人格中。山先生的誕生。就是中華民族的救星的出現。現在。這一顆光明的救星雖然不幸殞落了。但救星所迸裂出來的火花却爝火一般地長留在人間。</p>
<p>在紀念中山先生誕辰的今天。正是外患日深中華民族到了生死關頭的時候。因此。針對着目前的危機。凡是敬仰中山先生的中國入。都應該接受中山先生的革命主義和革命精神。來賡續奮鬥。並執行其可寳貴的遺敎來。解除當前的國難。挽救中華民族的淪亡。</p>
<p>中山先生所昭示我們的可賓貴的遺敎是些什麼。</p>
<p>第一。中山先生曾經說過。「三民主義就是救國主義。……何以說三民主義就是救國主義呢。因為三民主義是促進中國之國際地位平等政。治地位平等。和經濟地位平等。使中國永久適存於世界。所以說三民主義就是救國主義。」（三民主義民族主義第一講）現在正是救亡圖存的時候。三民主義决不是空洞的理想。而是中國革命應走的康莊大道。惟其如此。所以要實現三民卞義。其第一步就是「救國。」就是救亡圖存。古語云。「皮之不存毛將焉附。」在紀念中山先生誕辰的今天。我們惟一的任務。就是抵抗外來的侵略。保衛國土的完整。</p>
<p>第二。中山先生在遺囑中昭不我們。「余致力國民革命凡四十年。積四十年之經騐。深知欲達到此目的。必須喚起民衆。……共同奮鬥」在屢次講演中。又再三闡明「主權在民」的重要。在北上宣言中更說。「今日以後。當劃一國民革命之新時代使武力與帝國主義結合之現象永絕迹於國內。共代之而興之現象。第一步使武力與國民結合。第二步使武力為國民之武力。」同時「對於時局。主張召集國民會議。以謀中國之統一與建設。」現在正是應當集合全國人力智力財力物力共同來挽救垂亡的中國的時候。因此。我們捧讀中山先生的遺敎。誠懇地希望政府來領導民衆。民衆誓為政府後盾。以搶救垂亡的中國。要做到這一步。自然不能缺少中山先生所力倡的民生主義的精神。因為只有這樣。才能够使得「下情」「上達。」才能够「舉國一致精誠團結。」來「共赴國難。」</p>
<p>第三。中山先生在臨終的時候。曾再三說道。「和平奮鬥救中國」中山先生是和平主義者。其終極的理想是世界大同主義。中山先生在遺囑中又說道。「聯合世界上以平等待我之民族。共同奮鬥。」現在全世界正是和平陣綫與侵略陣綫肉搏的時候。我們為着保障東亞的和平。為着抵抗敵人的侵略。在「敵乎友乎」之間。我們應常奉守中山先生的遺敎。去求中華民族的友人。</p>
<p>上述三點。都是眼光遠大的中山先生早就敎訓給我們的。我們在紀念中山先生誕辰的時候。只有執行　遺敎。才不愧對中山先生。</p>

<p>日內瓦通信、一年一度的國聯常年大會本年（第十七屆）於九月二十一日開始、至十月十一日停會、這一决的大會、有幾個値得報告的問題、更可說是幾年以來在世界緊張的局面下比較有相當成績的一次、第一、如阿比西尼亞代表資格問題、在國聯大會之前數日、觀者都感覺是國聯的難關、不論大會採取何種方法、以拒絕阿國參加大會、在法律上及道德上、都不能維持世界民衆對於他最後的信仰、雖然此次阿國參加大會之表决、其中含着幾種原因、但是在公理與强權威脅之間、不能說不是一個勝利、就這一點上看來、世界民衆、對於國聯的信仰、成者還可以保存一時、第二、行政院恢復了常態、由國聯的普遍宗旨上來講、行政院自日本退盟我國落選、兩年以來、表現不平衡的狀態、行政院中只有歐美代表、而缺乏亞洲、不但與盟約精神違背、亦爲國際合作上重要阻碍、這種遺憾、現在已算彌補了、第三、世界民衆熱烈盼望的减軍會、消沉了幾年後、現在又有死灰復燃之望了、此外更就國聯盟約改組而論、雖然未來的結果、尚難猜度、但是就已答復之三十餘國的意見看來、大多數中張增强盟約的力量、超向實際的居多、假如世界民衆不放棄他們的督促力量、世界和平或者不致絕望、我國爲會員之一、就人口與地城來講、在世界所負的和平使命、不下於任何國家、我國之參加國聯工作、不僅爲其本身、同時並爲世界和平而努力、我們不僅　望國際之諒解、同時亦望國人自身瞭解也、記者爰將此次大會之經過、報吿於後、惟恐篇幅過長、更因時問限制、故所述不免偏重於我國、但如國聯盟的改組及減軍問題、均擇要叙述、以供硏究國際問題者之參考、</p>

<p>資格之波折　於述說此問題之前、一與此有連帶關係之問題、不能不加以追述的、乃國聯秘書畏愛文諾之羅馬旅行、這决的旅行、惹起輿論的不少譏評、有的說愛文諾前往羅馬、與其說勸駕、莫若說謝罪、究竟如何、我們固不必管他、但是最低限度、對於阿國代表出席大會文題、似乎已成立一種非正式的意見、假如對於這種意見、我們沒有曲解、則義大利代表團後來在邊境靜候向日內瓦出發的理由、也不必加以解釋、這是一般人尚疑問、這種疑問、恐怕只有愛文諾能够回答的、而在這個疑問之下、便生出了不少波折、造成了國聯有史以來第一决資格審查委員會難以產生的結果小國家旣想左右逢源、不能負這個重大的責任、大國家如英法、雖然有他們固定的外交政策、希望在這决的機會之下、把義大利請回日內瓦、以便利於進行洛迦諾的問題、然而在法律上、又找不到一個充分的理由、可以取消阿國國聯會員的資格、這個世界公共實見監視之下的責任、也不願坦然的担負、所以在此種情形之下、資格審查委員會、竟不能產生、遂不得不用投票方式來解决、投票結果、英國艾登·法國外長德爾泊斯·蘇俄李維諾夫·捷克奧蘇斯基·希臘波利第斯·土耳其亞拉斯·秘魚杜代拉·紐絲蘭若丹·荷蘭林百克等代表當選、於是資格審查委員會、始告成立、我國未當選、我代表團中、頗有彈冠相慶之槪、可是假如同樣事件發生於我國當選以後的行政院、我國可將採取什麽態度呢、</p>
<p>委員會在大會開會後的第三日、才能完成報告書、中間經過了幾决會議、幾乎難找到一個具體的辦法、於是由委員會又產生一個分委員會、專門硏究阿國眼前的地位及其元首在法律上的資格、再報於委員會、以便討論、幸而委員會中、有兩位較有勇氣的代表一位是荷蘭代表林百克、一位是蘇俄代表李維諾夫、林百克提識徵求海牙法庭的意見、雖然是一種推諉的辦法、但是究竟比較左右逢源的政策高明得多、這個提議、經委員會討論之後、發現兩種顧慮、第一、恐怕法庭硏究之後、認爲不是一個純粹法律上的問題、而是一個國際政治問題、不負顧問的責任、第二、時間關係、法庭之答覆、不是短期內可以得到的、至少須經過幾個星期的光陰、遠水不救近火、大會無論如何、不能等到法庭答覆之後、進行工作、最後李維諾夫很激動的說、如果有人反對阿比西尼亞參加大會、請其正式　明理由、如果沒有委員會、何必再拖延下去、結果、大家面面相覤之下、却沒有一個敢公開的反對、阿國代表的資格、始能通過、雖是艾登與德爾波斯的不幸、可是不能說是國聯之不幸、在英法的報上、多有說李維諾夫得到很大的勝利、英國保守派機關報上、譴責艾登、說他沒有貫澈他的外交政策、甚至工黨的報上、也說艾登已到了辭職的時期、如何還不辭職呢、可見這次的波折、不是一個臨時性質、不過臨時變遷罷了、報告書的理由如下、「查其委任狀、爲從前委派數次出席大會代表團之同一當局、但當發表九月（本年）十四日與十九日之委任時、阿國之情形、在各種方面、均有很大的變遷、其國家允首、居留外國政府、已不在其首都、根　各種文件之陳述、謂另一政府當局、將成立於其他部份、欲判斷其當局之威權及與其元首中間不在關係上力量之性質與範圍、似乎特別困難、問題之本身、在于由該元首的法銜所須的委任、是否完全合乎手續、委員會深感此問題之嚴重、故無任何人提議採取拒絕辦法、而聲明該委任狀爲不合理、反之、更無人不懷疑究竟合乎手續吾、在此種情形之下、一時雖會想到提請大會、徵求國際法庭之顧問、按照海爾塞拉西陛下現在地位其所發出之委任狀、是否合乎大會章程第五項第二節之要求、足使携有該項委任狀者、合乎盟的第三條第一節之意義、爲國聯會員國代表之一、但同時發生另一問題、郎如果法庭着手討論上述之點、絕不是幾個星期內可望得到回答的、在該特期中、本屆大會、勢必已閉會、同時阿比西尼亞之代表團、將處於何種地位、根據大會章程第五項第四節「對於發生異議的任何代表、如果大會無其他决議時、得臨時參加大會、與其他代表享受同樣權利、」由此項條例觀察之、阿國代表團、可否參加本屆大會之問題、於法庭答復以前、應實際决定、其理由甚爲明顯矣、目如果遵照最後一節之意義、則海牙之答覆、將無實際的價値、故最好的辦法、請大會對於阿國代表團委任狀、不問其合理與吾、均認爲有准許其代表團參加本屆大會之充分理由、此爲委員會之一致見解、且於通過時、曾經愼重考慮、認爲惟有使該代表於懷疑之中、得到專助、並就阿國眼前情形言之、該項辦法、僅限定於本屆大會、不牽涉任何將來的意見、委員會根據上述各稱意見、及實行其完全責任、謹請大會准許阿國代表團參加本屆大會之工作」云、報告書在大會中宜讀後、匈牙利代表要求投票表决、同時奧國與阿爾班尼亞代表附議、大會遂付表决、贊成報告書者三十九國、爲南菲聯邦阿根廷·澳大利亞·比利時·英國加拿大·中國·哥崙比王·古巴·丹麥·都氏尼堅·西班牙·愛斯頓尼亞·阿比西尼亞·芬蘭·法國·希臘·海地·印度·伊拉克·伊朗愛爾蘭·萊多維亞·立陶宛·盧森堡·墨西哥·挪威·紐西蘭·荷蘭·秘魯·波蘭羅馬尼亞·瑞典·捷克·土耳其·蘇俄·烏拉圭·南斯拉夫、反對者四國、爲阿爾班尼亞·奧國·匈牙利·赤道國、投中立票者六國、爲保加利亞·巴拿馬·葡萄牙·暹羅·瑞士·溫尼瑞拉、報告書遂告通過、阿國因得參加本屆大會、而這·塲波折的外觀如委員會的報告書中所說、乃因國王出走、政府不在首都、便等於失掉會員國的資格、但是國王何以出走、政府何以不在首都、對於這個事實與責任、却沒有一句解釋、而被侵略者、反而失却一切權利、可爲前車鑑矣、在報告書完成之前一日、與國聯同時開會的國際無綫電和平宜傳會議、主席義大利代表、奉其政府命令、宣佈退出會議、以對國聯表示威脅、而在邊境上靜候消息的義大利代表團、也不能不向羅馬開倒車、黑衣首相的心裏、自然也很不舒服、（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c85">我們的信念（代發刊辭） <a href="#c85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>蟻社成立到現在，已六年了。檢查六年來工作的成績，我們對於社會文化所貢獻的，真是微薄得很，不能不覺得深自慚愧；但是，我們决不自餒，我們相信祇要對于文化有着真確的把握，循着正當的途徑去努力，决不會勞而無功，得不到一些收獲。</p>
<p>我們不是文化至上主義者，我們反對一切的不合理都歸罪于文化，或是由文化來解决一切，但是我們亦决不否定文化的力量，因而忽略了它給與社會的反作用。這就是我們要從事文化運動的理由。</p>
<p>我們認為文化是和宇宙間的一切同樣是流動不居的東西。因此，各時代有各時代的文化。過去的文化，决不再能適合現代的需要。現代的文化，必須是要和現代的需要相配合，這是我們在從事文化運動的時候，對文化所有的認識。</p>
<p>我們反對文化被少數人所霸佔，而用作壓迫多數人的工具。我們堅决的主張，文化是應該屬於大眾的，應該是大眾的精神食糧，用來改進大眾的生活。所以大眾是我們文化運動的對象。</p>
<p>因為大眾是我們文化運動的對象，所以我們認識從事文化運動必須要深入到大眾中間去，體念大眾的需要，作為我們文化運動的指針，這是我們對文化運動所取的態度。</p>
<p>我們相信文化在發展的過程中，新舊文化的衝突，是必然要發生的現象。我們要為新文化努力，我們必須要不屆不撓，始終如一，才能完成我們的希望，這是我們對文化運動應有的精神。</p>
<p>以上是我們——每一個蟻社的社友——所有的共同信念。過去我們是在這共同的信念下努力着。現在還是如此。將來呢，還是要堅守着這個信念。蟻社不僅是蟻社社友的蟻社。蟻社應該是屬於全社會的。我們深深地希望，熱心文化運動的人們，給與我們寶貴的助力。</p>
<h3 id="c86">蟻社社歌歌詞 <a href="#c86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>螞蟻是愛羣互助的小蟲，</p>
<p>螞蟻是有集團組織的大眾，</p>
<p>我們都是螞蟻，</p>
<p>不是吃書無用的蠢蟲，</p>
<p>在這光明與黑暗决鬥的戰壕中，</p>
<p>我們要前衝，</p>
<p>前衝前衝前衝前衝，</p>
<p>我們都要前衝，</p>
<p>用螞蟻的精神，</p>
<p>來播植新文化的種，</p>
<p>使新世界的光明更加燦爛鮮紅，</p>
<p>起來起來螞蟻們，</p>
<p>大家起來螞蟻們，</p>
<p>向前去做自由平等自由平等的先鋒。</p>
<h3 id="c87">蟻社與現階段的文化運動 <a href="#c87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>— 陳卓</p>
<p>現階段的文化運動，當然是繼承前一階段而來的。但因為敵人不斷的侵略，民族危機的加重，它必然地要担負起新的任務，這新的任務是什麽？是要很迅速地建立起國防文化。換句話說：現階段的文化運動，應該是國防文化運動。</p>
<p>國防文化運動，和軍事上、政治上、經濟上的國防運動一樣，是要集合整個的力量，以抵抗敵人的總攻，使民族危機得以挽救，並取得最後的勝利。</p>
<p>這，一切從事文化運動的團體與個人，更負有推動的責任。</p>
<p>蟻社是一向努力文化運動的團體，無論在那一個時期，它都表現出很大的力量，這從它所屬的各部門來看，螞蟻圖書館的不斷擴充，螞蟻劇團的經常公演有意義的戲劇，螞蟻補習夜校的擴大，讀書會的改為學術研究會，交誼會的舉行各交誼，以及其他種種進展，不僅使社員每年激增，對于文化上的影響，也是一天一天的擴大。這，一方面固然由于社友們對于所屬各部門工作的努力，但另方面不能不說是它把握住了每個時期的任務。</p>
<p>現在是新的任務擺在我們面前了，我們不僅要抱着一貫的精神，還要加倍的努力與一切從事文化運動的團體緊　着手，並盼望熱心文化運動的人都參與到我們這里來。我們大家向着現階段的文化運動邁進！</p>

<p>冀察政務委員會委員王揖唐、為弔唁段祺瑞氏之喪、於九日晚、由津乘平滬通車南下、業於昨晨七時四十分逕行抵滬、在北站下車後、首赴靜安寺路滄洲飯店休息、旋卽於十時半許、至霞飛路段宅弔唁、值茲華北局勢之下、王氏固亦極可注視之人物、　新聲社記者、爰特往訪於段宅、比承延見、暢談一切、茲紀其談話如下、</p>
<p>專為唁段</p>
<p>王氏首稱、本人自上次來滬迄今，已一年有半、以年事已老、近將舊作整理、並因身體常病、此次若不為段先生之喪、並不欲來滬、稍留卽須北返、待段先徐開弔之期、當再前來、</p>
<p>華北情形</p>
<p>關於華北情形、余在未辭冀察政委會常委之前、知之比較尚詳、及今春辭去常委職後現僅存委員名義、且不大問事、故所知不多、惟華北積年以來、危險固隨時可以發生、目下綏遠方面、比較吃緊、察北則尚無事、計犯綏偽匪、有李守信·王英·等部、現北方局勢、焦點殆已移綏、方今交涉正在中央進行之際、揆諸常理、殊不應再有意外發生、</p>
<p>殊難臆斷</p>
<p>談至此、記者乃叩以對於局勢前途之觀察、據答、此殊難臆斷、要視將來之變化如何、中央交涉之結果、地方情形之演進、在在有連帶關係</p>
<p>外交主張</p>
<p>王氏繼談、關於華北外交、在三年前黃膺白氏未北上前、本人曾有折衝、前二年赴廬謁見蔣委員長、以及前年赴日、均不無關係、自辭去常委職後、現則與日方鮮有往來、本人之外交意見、認為無論剛柔、親善或抗戰、成敗利鈍、唯一必須「整個舉國一致、不能整個﹂卽係弱點、現在我國各方、均已有鑒及此、譬如段先生前此之毅然南下、亦卽所以表現整個行動之精神、對於最近中日外交之談判、內容如何、余全不知、故殊難表示意見、</p>
<p>經濟提携</p>
<p>至於中日經濟提携、今春余在青晤及張外長時、曾有談及、認為如若本「平等互惠」原則、非但日本、任何國家、均可以言提携、但如含有侵略意味、則又當別論矣、</p>
<p>匯業問題</p>
<p>最後記者叩以中華匯業銀行復活事、王氏謂、本人乃該行股東之一、自二十三年被推為總理以來、迄今從未有若何接洽、查該行債權積務關係、計債權有政府欠欵一千五百萬、債務為存欵四百萬、鈔票八十餘萬、該行組織、中日理監事各半、除總理為本人外、副總理為日人、我方理事為李思浩·曹汝霖·曾雲沛·監事段宏綱曾鎔甫、目下中日兩方股東、均不願恢復、故亦無須接洽、將來如雙方同意、俟有機會、不妨進行云云、</p>

<p>律師劉相、字吉人、前因其有房屋一所、坐落本市老西門外肇嘉路、現改為和平路卽電車轉角之處、在上海市工務局計劃拓寬該段道路、須收用其屋基三丈餘、認為處理不公、損失過鉅、於民國十八年十二月間、具呈工務局、請求變更、經工務局於同年十二月十三日批示、本市放寬路面、收用土地、悉照築路徵費暫行章程辦理、對於兩旁業主產業之損益、並無</p>
<p>畸輕畸重</p>
<p>所請變更路綫一節、事關定案、未便照准、劉乃向上海市政府提起訴願、經決定駁回、劉再訴願於內政部、又經決定維持上海市政府之決定、劉不服、於上年提起訴訟於行政院、因上海　　於控訴公署為主體之行政訴訟、係屬創舉、故其地產承租人虞南魁亦參加訴訟　劉相訴詞　旨、謂　系爭地</p>
<p>馬路寬度</p>
<p>旣規定為二十公尺、卽不應於二十公尺之外、違法強收、（二）公布道路系統原案、並無何處特別加寬之明文、且該地市面並非如何繁盛、無娛樂場所、照二十公尺寬度、於交通並無妨碍、所謂廣場、不過工務局搪塞之詞、（三）依土地徵收法第十五條、徵收土地、應經過協議程序、而所謂協議、係指土地應否微收及徵用若干尺寸而言、工務局</p>
<p>未予協議</p>
<p>顯係違法、被告官習答澄、謂協議專指地價、亦屬誤會、（四）蘇州拓寬宮巷道路、曾　人民請求縮減寬度、上海聯運車站、亦因圈地問題而暫停建築、足見徵收土地計劃、為顧全人民利益、非絕無變理之餘地、請求撤銷原決定及原處分、改判馬路寬二一公尺等語、而虞南魁之</p>
<p>參加意旨</p>
<p>略謂、參加人於民國十八年因創設滬南食品娛樂公司、訂約包租原告房屋基地、因工務局於二十公尺之外、徵收土地、妨礙翻造、查東門路交通繁盛、路寬尚僅三丈八尺、和平路自不應於二十公尺外、再加徵收、參加人因間接蒙其損失、故輔助參加等語、經院通知內政部答辯、謂（一）市政府公布馬路寬度、係於法定範圍內行其職權、其於道路交匯之衝</p>
<p>擴大廣場</p>
<p>加增面積、仍未出乎職權範圍以外、對於市組織法、並無抵抗、（二）協議地價、係徵收程序內之事、自可依法辦理、主管行政機關職權、人民絕無反抗餘地、（三）蘇州拓寬宮巷、縮減寬度、及暫停建設上海聯運車站二案、係主管機關自行變更、與本案情不同等語、該院將兩造理由審核後、謂直隸於行政院之市政府、因與辦公共事業、</p>
<p>徵收土地</p>
<p>時、除土地徵收法第十條所定為擴展公共道路而須折毀人民之房屋者、得由主管官署自行決定外、均應由與辦事業人擬具計劃書、並附地圖、呈經國民政府內政部核淮公告、引為土地徵收法第八條及第九條所明定、可見拓寬道路案、原屬公共事業、其所需土地、除其他方法、逕向土地所有人收買外、固得依法徵收、但須遵照</p>
<p>明定秩序</p>
<p>辦理、本件上海市工務局因拓寬道路、認為應收用原告屋基三丈餘、原告則以收用過多、申述異議、原處分駁斥原告之請求、謂收用土地、悉照築路徵費暫行章程辦理、查上海市築路徵費暫行章程第三條規定、凡因築路收用土地、俱遵照國民政府公布之土地徵收法辦理、而卷查原處分官署、並無</p>
<p>依法呈准</p>
<p>徵收土地之案、至市政府核准公布之滬南區東部道路系統、原屬整理道路計劃、目旣須折毀人民房屋、自不能適用土地徵收法第二條規定、在未經法定機關核准以前、卽難認為有徵收之根據、復查上海市拓寬道路規則第二條、凡有礙路綫之建築物、於翻造時、均應遵照路綫一次收進、又第三條業主遵照、</p>
<p>路綫收進</p>
<p>時、市政府主當局、即照章付予補償金之全部、此種規定亦能就合意收買者而言、故可無經過征收程序之必要、並非謂征收土地程序、旣有法律規定、猶可以單行章则而變更、結論云、係觀上述收受補償金時，實際即等於合意之收買、倘土地所有人對於收讓持有異議、則唯有依照土土征收法辦理、經呈准　告後、如不能因協議而取得權利、依法　應組織征收審查委員會議定之、本件原告對於</p>
<p>收用土地</p>
<p>旣有異議、原處分官署如認為必須照所定計劃收用、自應呈謂市府依照征收法規定、方為正當、如遽批駁　於法無據、而訴願及再訴願決定本予糾正、亦均不合自應一併撤銷、至事實上系爭地有無開闢廣場之必要、以及收用丈尺多寡、均屬征收計劃範圍、旣未經核准公告、原告請求判定路寬二十公尺</p>
<p>無可核駭</p>
<p>惟原處分官署收用土地並未具備法定手續、原告指摘違法、非無理由、乃判決主文、應由市工務局呈由市政府依照土地征收法規定之程序辦理、現劉相執此判詞、三次催告不理、遂在上海地方法院聲請調解、命工務局長沈怡賠償損夫二萬零六百五十二元、昨日由於推事開庭、沈怡委胡亭吉（卽前丈量劉之土地者）代理、據劉相陳訴云、當時並未通知、所通知者乃拆造、是胡亭吉假公濟私、而胡云被告應為內政部、不必調解、因此調解不成、仰正式起訴、</p>

<p>— 中國徵信可主編</p>
<p>（一）中國銀行新設紐約分行　該分行係該行常務董事陳光甫先生赴美考察時與美國財部商洽之結果，蓋因隨中美間貨幣協定之成立，中美銀行界實有進一步合作之必要，故中行決設分行於紐約，並請王正序先生及美人柏澤斯君為該分行經理；中國銀行業之直接參與美國市場，以此為嚆矢。</p>
<p>（二）華安商業儲蓄銀行辦理強束　該行係胡蒓薌，張澹如等所發起，於二十一年冬着手籌備，至翌年五月成立股東會，七月四日正式開業，一次收足資本五千萬元，經營商業及儲蓄業務。董事長為俞實澄君，由胡蒓薌君自任總經理。開業以來，初時營業尚稱發達，第一年所吸之存欵卽達一百三十萬元，近年來因受不景氣影響，放欵多不能如期收回，且自中交儲蓄部開辦以來，一般存戶，類皆提欵轉存，以致業務中落，資本頓感滯呆，主持者乃於六月三十日召開臨時股東會，但因人數不足，宣告流會，不得已除重行規定本月二十九日再開股東會商決外，一面將行址自寗波路二七一號遷至同路七三號，並將員工裁減，以便節省開支，同時停止收受存欵及放欵，專辦結束事宜，迄二十九日股東會開會時，始將董事會提案通過，正式宣告強束。</p>
<p>（三）上海綢業商業儲蓄銀行改組　該行創業於二十二年九月一日，為綢業界領袖王延松，駱清華等發起設立。初時資本額定五十萬元，嗣因認股踴躍，乃增至六十萬元，並於漢口路自建五層大廈，推王延松君為董事長，兼任總經理；後因業務發達，原有資金仍感不敷支配，乃再添加股本至一百二十萬，加入上海銀行業公會及上海票據交換所。去年該行並首創承兌匯票制，頗為金融界所重視。最近因受市面不景氣影響，又因王君倦勤，曾一度發生擠提。該行董事會為重振業務計，乃特聘江蘇銀行總經理陸子冬先生兼任該行經理，並由中國，中央，交通三行充分接濟資金，以圖重振業務云。</p>

<p>國人混合組雙打嚴敬姜周社軍，昨遇勁敵克冷諾甫夫婦、克氏抽殺峻急、克夫人亦平穩可喜、嚴周時時被困、第一盤中敵方戰鬥活躍、嚴周雖圖反攻、均未見功、不移時、卽成四對一之比、克夫婦再度努力、卽以六比三獰得該盤、第二盤中周冠軍表演甚佳、會造成五與五和局、一時頗有中興氣象、克竭力猛攻、嚴等亦誓死奮鬥、末二局中、競爭極度劇烈、卒以周嚴一人連絡稍疏、再告敗績、</p>

<p>二、領袖民衆的關係於此、我們首先便應當認識國家與個人、國力與自力、領袖與民衆、向心力與自動力的聯繫、</p>
<p>就個人與國家的聯系說、國家是一個有機體、個人爲搆成國家生命的細胞、我的身體、卽爲國家之細胞、我之生命、卽爲國家的一部、個人與國家、一方面固有其不可分離休戚與共的聯系性和統一性、一方面又各具其特殊的機能、爲國民者、應各本所能、各盡其責、爲滿足其總體的需要而努力、（註三）</p>
<p>就國力與自力的聯系說、則國家之發展、實基於全國人民智德體的優性、離開了全國人民智·德·體·優性的發展、就沒有充實國力的可能、必須把各人的聰明才力、貢獻給國家、集全國人民經濟·道德·精社·肉體的力、才能蔚爲强固的國力、所以充實國力的前提、端賴其國家生命的細胞、卽每一個國民、是否能盡其國民的天職爲滿足其總體的需要而努力、爲亢進其國家的機能而奮鬥、（註四）</p>
<p>就領袖與民衆、向心力與自動力的聯系說、任何民族國家的發展、一定要有兩個重要條件、一方面是國家觀念的發展、一方面是國民食任的自覺、世界列强、所以能够雄飛猛進、便是基於這兩種歷史的動力的推動、人類無論在那個時代、必具有兩重資格、一方面爲集體的一員、一方面則爲獨立的自我、（註五）由前者說、則需要擁護領袖的向心力山後者說、　需要全國民衆的自動力、</p>
<p>中國民族、所以會有今日的衰第、便是由於以上各種職繫的脫節、一方面缺乏統一的向心的國家觀念、因此自私自利、因私害公、不守紀律、不能團結、一方面則習於頽廢、不思振發、一般民衆、受了晋魏六朝以後歷史的惰力所支配、從而形成了一種械端浪漫的頽敗性、把個人對於國家的責任心、對於社會的自動力完全消失了、（註六）</p>
<p>所以今日救國的工作、實應兼籌並顧、雙管齊下、一方面固需要賢明的領袖、一方面允宜注　民衆的訓練、領袖固十分重要、然而領袖與民衆的關係、却好比金字塔的尖頂與底線、一定需要健全廣大的民衆、爲其基礎、庶幾有所憑藉、而不致隕越、領袖的能力、縱使超越羣倫、但是他究非三頭六臂、終是鞭長莫及、至少需要個個富有動力的民衆、爲其後盾、然後才能相得益彰、事半功倍、吾則、譬如一排輪軸毀折、破舊不堪的列車、縱使車頭的機器如何有力、也是無法飛躍前進的、</p>
<p>革命後的蘇俄、所以有今日建設成績、國力發展、一方面固是於他們統治階級的有力、一方面亦麩他們敎首民衆訓練民衆的結果、戰後德國的復興、其基本動力、也是在他們民衆固有的剛毅堅貞刻苦自强的精神、希特勒的崛起、固爲時會所造成、而國社黨的發展（允爲德國歷史的常態、（註七）且决、如莫索利尼統治意大利以後、他也時時深慮到「人亡政息」的危險、所以他非常關於國民的訓練、論者不察、以爲英素利尼之成功、乃祖述馬哲佛利Machiavel的霸道、殊不知莫氏所以能推動意大利、實別有其所基的動力、莫氏認爲一般國家的衰落、實由其國尺的精神、故一方面雷厲風行、努力於政治機構的改造、以加强向心的力量、一方面允脚踏實地、埋頭於國民精神的砥礪、以啟發其固有奮鬥、耐勞·勤儉·慷慨·勇敢·熱烈·同情·的德性·使全國人民、個個有力、能承繼其光恢民族生命之偉大的歷史使命、</p>
<p>於此、應知領袖的成功、不是偶然的、非可倖致的、一定要全國民衆、能發揮他自動的能力、以爲領袖的後盾、始能作長期的奮鬥、始能操必勝的左劵、如果全國民衆、存了依賴的心理、不改頹廢的習性、一任領袖孤軍奮鬥、而不為之後援、則其奪門的效果、一定事倍功半、卽有成功、亦難維持於久遠、前事不忘、後事之師、所以我們如果誠有愛於領袖、則擁護領袖的方法、並不在虛表的頌揚、更不在一時的興奮、而在平時脚踏實地、埋頭切齒於全國人民的訓練、全民動力的培養、務使全國民衆、無論士農工商、男女老幼、個個都能各就本位、認識其任務、完成其對於國家社會應盡之大職、以减少領袖的辛勞、以分負領袖的重任、集中全民自動的力量、以爲領袖助、而爲領袖用、則領袖與民衆、纔如魚之得水、相得益彰、這樣領袖的苦鬥、與民衆的努力、才能互相平衡、兼程並進、共同完成救亡復興、艱靴困苦的歷史的使命、</p>

<p>標紗前市開盤、本月份因多頭掉期、氣勢獨挫、惟十二月一日期較緊、但有一部份因其價格已達高境、採取逢漲拋賣主義、查大都多頭因存貨不厚、拉緊仍不放棄、所以盤旋之力甚强也、標紗結果本月比上日收盤、獨跌一允六角、遠跌四·五角、午後開盤、本月市况甚疲、因紗廠工潮不難解决、多頭開始掉期、市狀更挫、敲破三十　關口、遠月牽動下跌、結果本月期比上午收盤價再跌一元三角、遠跌五·六角至一元、查賣出明德二千一百包、振大一千九百包、長餘十千包、義或一千六百五十包、潤康三千一百包、大昶一千八百包、裕大一千七百五十包、賡豐一千零五十包、大昌成二千二百五十包、長豐一千一百五十包、買進合興二千二百五十包、瑞大二千五百包、愼記一千三百包、泰昌二千九百五十包、益昶二千六百五十包、同豐一千三百五十包、昶記九百五十包、一日間最高低市盤列左、</p>

<p>標花前市開盤、近月仍疲乏、因美棉一味下降、人心不振、但拍至遠期轉昂、因獲利者抵補、二盤後市轉上升、但各路來源擁擠、結果各月比上日牧盤價均漲二角半、午後開盤、因紗廠工潮不日當可解决、人心轉挺、空頭活動抵進、市盤回擊、結果近月比上午收盤價再漲五分至二角、遠期平平、查賣出泰昌七千八百擔、長豐七千五百擔、益康五千四百擔、源與昌七千六百擔、裕康一千二百擔、振大二千四百擔、同豐一千二百擔、恊成四千五百擔、晋康二千八百擔、大昶一千五百擔、買進通記五千四百擔、恒益五千九百擔、裕大三千八百擔、錦昌二千九百擔、合興四千二百擔、賡豐二千一百擔、豐泰五千六百擔、望泰興三千四百擔、永大三千一百擔、明德四千二百擔、仁豐二千五百　、長和二千三百擔、茲將一日間最高低及收盤價列左、</p>

<h3 id="c194">候端 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— 雲波</p>
<p>在明朝時候。倭寇非常猖獗，市場恃勢橫行，到我國沿海一帶來侵略騷擾；那江浙兩省，便是受禍，嚴酷的地方。因此也就是應時產生許多抗倭的英雄，流傳下來許多轟轟烈烈，可歌可泣的史蹟。像戚繼光和俞大猷等，便是因此成名的。候端也是那時的一個英雄，但是這個名字，恐怕還沒有多少人知道吧。</p>
<p>侯端是江蘇省金山縣的勇將，從小便練習武藝，所以技術精通，等閒幾百個人，扳都扳不動，那裏還近得他的身子，真可說是拔山扛鼎的英雄，銅筋鐵骨的豪傑。</p>
<p>一天，他在衙門前和人談天，有人道：「古時候的勇士，總說兩臂有千鈞的力氣，不知道這話確不確。」另外一人便向他道：「候大哥，我們只知你力氣大，不知你究竟有多少力量？」侯端聽了，便向衙門前重有千斤的石獅，相了一相道：「這石獅子不知我能不能拿動」。他說完便立了起來，走到石獅子面前，俯下身子，用兩手抱著石獅，先搖了一搖，然後把身子一挺，那石獅便離地伏在他的懷裡了。他還抱著牠在場裏走了一轉，仍舊放到原處，面不紅，氣不喘，笑盈盈地又手問道：「怎麼樣？」這時早已把看的人嚇呆了，他們只是伸著舌頭縮不進去，那裏還說得出話來。</p>
<p>有一次，侯端騎了一匹馬，在路上走，他一路看著山青水綠的風景，不覺自心裏想道：「光陰過得很快，我卻還沒有幹些事業出來，若照這樣下去，豈不是辜負自己的一身銅筋鐵骨嗎？我疏散了多年，不知近來筋骨已衰頹了沒有－－」？這時他正走到一所石牌樓下面，他便兩手一伸，抓住上面的橫眉，兩足挾馬用勁向上一提，這便連人帶馬，懸空比弔起，練了一個三上弔。過了好一會，這才將手一鬆，使馬蹄著地，然後若無其事地策馬揚長而去。</p>
<p>鄰縣南匯，不知從那裏來了一隻白額虎，時常出來傷害人畜，把近處的居民，嚇得連日裏也不敢出門。政府雖然懸賞招人捕捉，可是應賞往捉的獵戶反被大蟲傷了好幾個，聲勢格外厲害。弄得那地人民，寢食不安，日夜憂懼著。這消息傳到侯端耳中，他便自告奮勇，帶著刀去打虎。經過一場惡戰，結果是把那橫暴的猛虎殺死了，替地方除了一個大害。</p>
<p>侯端雖然這樣勇武，可是因為沒人賞識，沒有立功的機會，只是做著金山縣的一員守將罷了。</p>
<p>這時恰巧倭寇又來侵略金山，帶著十三隻倭寇，領著好幾萬人，聲勢極盛，浩浩蕩蕩，殺奔金山城南來。探子得到這消息，便立即報告到縣政府那裡去。那政府裏的官員，都是被倭寇嚇怕了的。一聽到這消息，早已失魂落魄，沒有主意。那裏還想得出保民的辦法，鼓得起抵抗的勇氣呢？他們只是各顧各自己身家性命，紛紛逃走了。</p>
<p>侯端既是一個義士，當然他知道守城抗敵是他的分內之事，不願逃避，何況這更是他大顯身手，建功立業的好機會，他怎會肯放棄。但是他只是一個小將手下也只有幾百個兵，勢力很微弱。那倭寇卻人多勢盛。又憑著一股勇氣殺來，更是銳不可當，眾寡不敵，是當時的實在情形，但他一點也不害怕帶出城抗敵，駐紮在東門外的楊家團地方。並把城裏的居民糧食等也都移到城外去，</p>
<p>在這邊剛準備好，倭寇的船，便已來了。侯端忙親自騎著馬，到海塘邊去察探倭寇的情形。那時潮水正退，近岸的水很淺，倭寇的大船不能駛進來，在離岸約一里多遠的地方停泊著。他們正在放小劃船，準備運兵衝上岸來，當先由一個穿紅衣的賊將率領著，指揮著那些小船，一線兒連貫著，直向海岸進發。</p>
<p>侯端見了，便撥馬入水，向那些小船那裏走過去。走了一段水漸漸深了，馬腹的皮轕擋著水，使他不易前進。侯端便跳下馬來，抽刀把皮轕割斷，掉落水裏，再跳上馬背，向前走去。走到小船約百步的地方，他便勒住馬，抽弓攜箭，向著那紅衣賊將，一箭射去。那紅衣賊將，正在指揮，不提防一箭直刺咽喉，便撲地倒下去了。倭寇們見主將忽然倒地，都吃一驚，秩序便亂了起來。大家急急忙忙地把船追回，攏著大船。隔了一會，他們看見侯端只有一人，便更添一批人馬，重新衝向岸來，一人不能抵擋，使撥馬退回來。在路上他遇著一個牧羊人，他恐怕倭寇望著他所騎的白馬追來，便向那人借一隻羊殺卻，把羊血塗在馬身上，把白馬變成紅馬。這樣他才能安安穩穩地退回楊家團了。</p>
<p>那倭寇來侵略的目的，本為擄掠。如今上岸後，當然要擄些男子，替他們效勞服役，掠些婦女，供他們姦淫取樂，更要搜刦些財物，準備滿載而歸。他們一路恃勢橫行，做著許多焚燒屠殺的慘舉，演著各種兇橫殘酷的把戲。迫得沿海一帶的居民，家境富裕些的紛紛聞風而逃避，剩下受宰割的，只是些貧民，那倭寇擄掠的慾望，怎會滿足？他們很知道城市裏是比較繁華的地方，人口既多，工商業也興盛，一切服用都較鄉間舒適，而且倉廩府庫裏定滿儲著糧食和財寶。他們刦掠的重心，當然還在城市。假使城市裏有重兵把守，他們還要拼死來犯，何況現在金山城毫不抵抗，他們當然更不客氣地佔據了。</p>
<p>那些倭寇既佔據著城市，那大部份的精銳之士便全部都上岸，在船上僅留些老弱殘兵守著。他們只當兵懼怕著不敢抗敵，他們只管姦淫擄掠，只管自己暫時取樂，并沒有預防和侵佔的計劃。侯端看出倭寇這缺點，便趁他們不防，在夜間率領著兵士，偷偷地去襲擊倭船。他呌兵士們各帶著硫磺煤油木柴火炬……等引火之物，到靠近船時，一齊放起火來，一霎時風助火威，把那大小船隻一齊燒著，只見一片紅光，照耀得如同白晝，把江面也映成血色。那些守船的兵，不死於火，便死於水，逃得上岸，也要死在刀劍上，竟一個都沒有逃脫。待到城裏的倭寇得信後，趕來救火，那些船早已化成灰燼。從此那些倭寇斷了歸路，失了救應，弄得進退兩難。只能死守著空城，派了一隊人駐紮唉西門外面做救應，卻出東門來，威風就此減去不少。</p>
<p>侯端見倭寇勢衰，便想乘機剿滅他們。因為他想假使讓他們這樣佔據下去，那末對國家便是失去了守土的責任，而且倘使若倭寇的後援到來，那更要如虎添翼地兇橫，官兵便再也休想去制服他們。所以他立即率領兵士去攻城。他自己騎著白馬，手執雙劍，便沿城走去，兜到南門，見城門也閉著，沒有辦法，他再馳馬望西門馳去。那西門卻是開著的，不過城河上的吊橋，已被毀去了。他正想領兵過河去衝殺，可是他回頭一望，他的兵士已被他馳馬的時候，拋棄得看不見了。但是駐紮在西門外的一羣倭寇，卻已蠢擁著一面包圍上來要捉他。他想：「罷了，到了此時，我還怕什麽，可是單單和她們拼命卻不合算。俗語說，「擒賊先擒王」，又說，「不入虎穴，焉得虎子。」不如素性讓我一人衝進城去，殺他一個爽快，再衝出東門回去，路也近些。』他想罷，便把馬退後幾步，拍著馬頭呌道：『馬呀！馬呀！你應該努力一下，躍過河去了。否則我和你都活不成了。』那馬也真靈巧，像懂得他的話似的，果然跳過河去了。他心裏高興，精神百倍，大喊一聲，直回城裏衝去了。</p>
<p>這城裏的倭兵想來捉他，被他砍瓜切菜似的，亂殺亂剁，擦著些兒便傷，挨著劍鋒便倒，那裏攔得住他。那侯端雖然單人匹馬，身處重圍，卻左衝右突，如入無人之境。只是倭寇人數太多，總殺不退，自朝至午，混戰不休，他覺得有些飢餓疲乏了，身上又受了許多傷，便不敢戀戰，只得殺開一條血路，奪路向東門奔去。</p>
<p>那些倭寇兒見攔不住他，便另出奇謀。用整匹粗布，兩端各用幾十個人拉著，橫在路中，想絆倒侯端的馬，侯端便用左手劍挑布，右手執劍將布割斷，一路衝去。到了東門，便斬關奪門而去出，不料旁邊又伏著一隊銳勾手，都川長鈎鈎他，一隻手臂竟被鈎住。那倭寇見鈎住了他，便幾十個人都用力去拉，幸而侯端力大，儘拉不動。他用力一掙，落力四片袍甲，掙脫了鈎，便帶著滿身血跡，拍馬回去了。</p>
<p>這邊城中被他單身衝殺，卻死了許多人。他們以後講起來，還當侯端是神將咧。</p>
<p>侯端經過這次大戰回營後，知道一人的勇力，終是不能剿滅倭寇的，他便召集殘兵，訓練民眾，一面把隊伍擴充，一面準備兵器糧食。同時努力教練，宣揚救國禦敵的真義。他的軍隊經過他長期訓練後，果然將精兵勇實力雄厚，和以前大不相同了。他知道時機成熟，便重新誓帥剿倭，大舉攻城，毫不費力地將那些倭寇打敗殺死。四散逃逸的，也都被四鄉的民眾，殺死的殺死，活捉的活捉，那些倭寇，終久被他全部殲滅了。</p>
<h3 id="c195">莫爾斯（Samual　Finley　Breese　Morse　1791-1872） <a href="#c195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— 李惟益</p>
<p>－電報發明者－</p>
<p>莫爾斯是個科學家藝術家，於西曆一七九一年的四月二十七日生在美國麻省（Massachusetts）的卡爾斯登（Charleston）地方，父親是個牧師。莫爾斯十四歲時進耶爾大學（Yale　College）讀書；在戴（Day）和西里曼（Sillimau）幾位教授教誨之下，他對於電學發生很大的興趣，結果他在這方面成名。</p>
<p>他早年的時候喜歡藝術多過科學，因此他跟美國當時一個最有名的藝術家阿爾登斯（Washington　Allston）學習，並且跟他道英國住了四年。他在這時期的成就是很大的。他於一八一五年回美國來，希望政府委任他當書歷史圖書的任務，但不能成功，他只得到卡爾斯登去做畫像的工作。後來又到紐約（New　York）去，就在那裏住定。一八二五年，他替美國國立圖樣設計專門學校（National　Acacemy　of　　Deaign）打個基礎，並且被舉為第一任校長。到一八二七年他對電學的興趣又復活了，這時他在哥倫比亞大學（Columbia　Collge）跟丹拿（J.F.Danna）教授學電磁學，但是他對於藝術趣味還濃厚，到了一八二九年他再到歐洲跟著從前的先生們研究。</p>
<p>他回國的那一年，一八三二，可以說是他結束藝術開始專心研究科學的時候。在歸航的甲板上，有一天他和幾個乘客討論電磁學的問題，他忽然像有所感，說：『假若電這樣東西在電線的任何部份都可以存在，我相信沒有消息不可以藉牠來傳達的。』</p>
<p>從此他發憤研究，不久便證明，電流可以沿著一條導線在一刹那開跑到任何的遠的距離去；並且知道假如線斷開了，就有火花發出來，他又發現火花這樣東西可以代表言語的一部份，或是字母或是數目；火花的消失又可以把話的另外一部份表示出來；假如火花存在或消失的時間延長了，又可以代表一些另外的字；於是字母可以很容易的造成，單字也可以表明出來了，費了幾天的工夫，他畫成了必須機械的一個粗略的圖稿，給他同船的人看。</p>
<p>接著莫氏又在窮困中刻苦研究了幾年，才完成他的發明；起先在一八三五年他發明了他久想補充的「繼電器」，於是在導線內經過了很長的距離而變弱的電流，又可以重新恢復起來。一八三六年他又完成了一部可以應用的電報機器到一八三七年的九月二日，在紐約大學他的房間裏，他把他的機器拿出給幾個朋友看，並在這裏安置好一七〇〇呎的銅線，試驗的結果很滿意，並且激勵了幾位呌做章爾（Vail）的兄弟紐及西（New　Jersy）地方的銅匠和鐵匠研究電上的興趣，從此他們常常和流在實用莫氏來往。</p>
<p>莫氏請求政府給他專利權，於一八三七年的九月二十八日批准了，不久他又呈請國會撥一筆津貼給他來作購買材料的費用，使電報在實際上能夠應用起來。呈文是由商業委員會接受的，商委會報告於國會時很替他說好話，但是國會把這事拖延起來沒料就發津貼給他，於是他又跑到歐洲各國去求專利權，但也沒有怎樣的成功：在英國，他的請求被拒絕了；法國雖準了他的專利權，並且給他一些津貼，但數目太少了不夠用，俄國以為他的發明沒有用，也未允許他，一年之後，他只得仍回到紐約來。</p>
<p>直到一八四三年的二月廿三日，國會才把他那久擱的呈文通過，並且給了他三萬元的津貼費；他就在巴的莫爾（Ballimore）與華盛頓之間把電報裝置起來。第二年的五月，兩地初次通話，成績很好，莫氏很高興，不知不覺的發出了這一句話：『上帝所做成的是什麽啊！』（What　Hath　God　Wrought）</p>
<p>莫氏和他幾位從前共同研究的同志既得了專利權，不久就組織起公司來，敷設遍佈全美國的電線，從此他的事業一天一天的發達起來，受到全世界各國政府和人民的讚美，奧，比，法，俄，土，瑞典，尼桑蘭（Netherland即今荷蘭）以及其他幾個小國更因為電報在他們國內應用的便利和廣大紛紛派代表送來獎金給他，一共收了四十萬法郎。</p>
<p>莫氏不但在電報這方面有不朽的成功，並且他在巴黎（Paris）時曾經和達古爾（Daguerre）先生和好，跟他研究攝影，也有相當的成就，美國開始用銀片攝影（塗銀的鹽類關於銅片上之攝影）他是第一人，海底電線也是由他發明的。他已於一八七二年的四月二日死於紐約，可是他的事業是不死的。</p>
<p>出版界</p>
<h3 id="c196">中國出版界之現狀及今後應走向的途徑 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— 大川</p>
<p>一個國家文化的盛衰她是完全投影在出版界上。我們一看世界各先進國家，其出版物數量之多少，而能決定其文化進展階程，如俄徳日美英法，便呈著這種顯著的現象；回顧我們自己的中國，文化落後，出版物之稀少，大有相形見拙望塵莫及之憾，曾記得外人說中國現在的文化，還是歐洲十八世紀的文化，更使我們顧影慚愧容無地了。</p>
<p>中國現在出版界是呈著什麽現象呢？牠所反映出來的文化是怎樣的呢？談到這些問題，真是感到非常的廣茫，因為範圍旁及之大，內情錯綜機構的複雜，自非數百言所能盡道，正如世人所謂一部二十二史，從何說起呢！</p>
<p>一般人之觀察現階段的中國出版界，自然以其實際的現象為發抒觀論之焦點，本文亦即根據此要焦點及周圍環境的情狀，作一梗慨的敘述，對於中國出版界當前之衰弱原因及今後所趨的新途徑，聊述管見如下：</p>
<p>（一）知識階級購買力薄弱，由於現在經濟的恐慌，都市和鄉村都陷於不景氣現象中，尤其是知識階級中人，苦悶更甚。爲了生活的壓迫，失業的損失，對於購買出版物的經濟力量，漸形薄弱。我曾經調查過好多很喜歡讀書的人，三四年前還能每年買幾十塊錢的書報，可是現在連幾塊錢的書也無力購買了，經濟的壓迫使他們陷於精神糧食的缺乏，這固然是知識界人最苦痛是事同時，也就是出版界一個重大的危機所在。</p>
<p>（二）出版物內容殊少精華，中國現在的出版物，以中國人自己看來，數量似乎也不少，平均起來，每天有四五種新書，每月有二三百種雜誌出版，全國各地報紙尚不在此例，但是看看牠們的內容，有新的創見或精粹的論述，為數極少，這不是過於冤枉的話，實際現在一般之從事編著出版物的人物，因其個人生活經驗的空虛，識見的淺狹，下筆為文，或剪裁他人的作品，或竊譯外人的論見，抄襲成章，首尾異調，內容錯亂散漫，文字乾枯艱澀，這種情景，每為一般作者易患之病，而患之重者，則其作品便帶著病毒走上出版界去，可憐那如迷途的羔羊的青年讀者，無形中便蒙受其害了。所以現在還有許多人對於新文化不作樂觀，對於現在出版界說來搖頭，歎為文化衰弱，出版物多流產，也不無其因。如此出版物本身之多病態，也能激少一部份讀的需求。</p>
<p>（三）爭印古書與翻版圖利，現在出版界上有一種特別的現象，便是所謂全國文化重地之上海的各書局，對於歷代古書，互相爭印。時代是向前走的，他們的出版物多是向後轉的，教育普及化的聲浪愈高，他們專為供給有閒階級欣賞的印品愈多。如最近神州國光社之「中國內亂外禍歷史叢書」這樣有計劃的整理，實際很少。我們並不是反對翻印古書，因為這也有其背景和當前的環境的決定，不出稿費而能復興固有的文化，天下何樂而不為了？還有一種偷印翻版的風氣，也非常之盛，這些風氣前九年在北平天津開封諸地曾不少的案件，現在上海此風還很仍熾。這種事情固然是干犯出版法，有害著作人及其出版家的利益，但是翻版的緣故，售價低廉，倒很受一般讀者的歡迎。即就學校教科用書一項，所占翻版的書籍也不少。不過紙張過劣，錯字過多，也不無貽害讀者的地方。此外如各種古今劍俠言情諸類小說之濫印，低價傾銷，風行全國，深入內地，這種出版界之投機事業，最足歸利獲盈，但對於整個的出版界並無什麽好處，因為他們的目的旨在攫錢，對於文化之進化根本漠不關心的。</p>
<h3 id="c197">讀書散記（續） <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>書共緒分八章，第一章為全論，第二章行政組織，第三章中央行政組織，第四章地方行政組織，第五章自治行政組織，第六章官吏的法律關係，第七章行政行為，第八章行政救濟。各章之下，再分節分母。如關於各種組織，則一一說明它的意義，系統，分類，特質，職權等項，每項均又為詳細分析，網舉目張，說理詳明，層次井然，而又處處能以本國的草製為參謀，使人便於了解切合研討。為確能達到淺顯完備，讀去毫不費力的程度。</p>
<p>再每一種制度，我們若要深切的了解它。最好把近似的制度相為比較。本書對於此點，也能注意到，如關於行政法，即說與行政學有目的，根據，結論的三種不同，委任與代理，則又四點的不同。官吏與公吏，亦有四點的互異。關於懲戒罰則，以刑罰為比較，而列舉根據，客體，原因，目的，時效，執行機關，裁量範圍的七種不同來說明。關於行政規程，則舉與行政命令的幾點不同為壽命。關於訴願與請願的區分，則舉出三個異點。行政訴訟與民事訴訟之區別，則又有三個異點。都是反復比較，而使認解益切的。</p>
<p>此外書中對每一法制，都曾並列諸家學說，然又並不是廣泛而無所依歸的。舉例如公法與私法的區別，有關係說，有法律說，利益說等，最後則指利益說較為完善。公法人與司法人的區別標準，則有目的事務說，國家機關說，團體權力說，國家關係說，人格差異說，最後說人格差異說為妥。關於命令若與法規抵觸時的應否服從，則舉法律，命令，折衷諸說，而謂折衷裏說妥當。所以我們看去雖然是諸說臚列，有目迷五色之惑，卻不至有「無所適從」之苦。而且唉書中對各說所下的評斷，我們更可因見解研究的不同，而生切磋推敲之效。</p>
<p>這都是本書的長處，這書上海漢文正楷印書局出版，定價一元。</p>
<p>同時我們還有一點附帶的感想，就是這本書的價值，是比較久長的。行政的法令，雖無時不在修訂增削，但行政法的淵源，不外乎命令法規等項，那末要研究行政法學，對於行政上不斷蒐集以備參考的必要，而使研究有實際的適合。而這本書可以作為是基本的讀物。完</p>
<h3 id="c198">「怎樣研究哲學」 <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 嚴以霖</p>
<p>王特夫著　江書店發行</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>近來很出了幾本哲學入門書，據我看來，可注意的只有兩本，其中一是艾思奇的「大眾哲學」，這是一本談話體的通俗哲學書，是適宜於大眾閱讀的——正如其名所示。此外就是這裏要談的王特夫的「怎樣研究哲學」，這是一本非常出色的哲學書；這雖說是以「入門書」的姿態而行世的，其實並不止是一本優秀的入門書。從來不知道「哲學」這一學科的內容的人們，讀了這本書，不僅能清楚「哲學」所含的是些什麽問題，或者這些問題的關係又是怎樣，他甚至能告訴你這些問題的歸宿。這未必為混亂地續了幾百本哲學書的人所能解答的。</p>
<p>這本書公分九章，每章或分三節或分二節。第一章「哲學是什麽性質的」，第二章「爲什麽應當研究哲學」，第三章「哲學研究中的實證的和經驗的方法」，這三章為全書第一部，可作為言看的。第四章「怎樣進行分析的研究」，第五章「怎樣進行綜合的研究」，第六章「如何作批判的研究」，第七章「研究的進行步驟」，這四章為全書的第二部，可視為「本論」。第八章「哲學綱要（一）——哲學內容的概要」，第九章「哲學綱要（二）——哲學發展史的概要」，這二章是對於哲學作了橫剖面和縱剖面的解說。以上是全書的綱要。筆者且不憚煩瑣，將其內陳德容擇要複述，然後再將其主要特徵和價值提出來談談。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>把全書的內容作一個簡略的提要，無論在介紹一本書或批評一本書時，都有其必要。以下所述的就是「怎樣研究哲學」全書的主要內容。至若提要的方法，是按章取要，將每章的中心意思說出來。</p>
<p>一、哲學是什麽：哲學是科學的一個部門，有資格被稱為科學，因為所謂科學，它是客觀事物及其運動的法則，反映和轉換成為人類思維之有組織的系統的知識；而哲學這種學問，它是把自然，社會及其與人類的思維之關係的全般的根本原理，加以禮系化，使之成為總和的，有組織有系統的知識，換言之，它是一樣的在運用這些法則去複述客觀存在的思維與存在的關係，以此兼論及一切存在界之最一般的最根本的規律，構成自己的知識體系，成為有規律性的學問；於此可見哲學確是一種嚴正的科學了。倘若具體說來，則那以宇宙整體為研究的題材時，乃是自然哲學或宇宙論的哲學所處理的對象；以社會整體為研究的題材時，則是社會哲學所處理的對象，以人類的思維和其與一般的存在之關係為題材時，就是單純的思維哲學之認為論和方法論所處理的對象。這也就是以研究的現實對象物而區分的哲學的類型。總之，哲學在論究存在及思維乃至他們的相互關係時，是綜合地研究著宇宙中最一般的最根本的運動法則之最高峰的科學，它是科學理論和方法之整個的理論的凝結物的科學。從方法論的見地來說，它可說是「科學的代數學」。</p>
<p>二、爲什麽要研究哲學：哲學的研究，一方面是為了要認識宇宙，社會，人生而有其必要，他方面則是爲了實踐而有其必要。我們研究哲學，乃在於能替自己形成一種宇宙觀，社會觀和人生觀的思想體系，幷獲得正確的宇宙觀，社會觀和人生觀，以指導我們的行動。要求，乃是人類的實際生活所引起的，而且為了繼續生活，也就不能不有正確的哲學的思想體系作為前進的指南，——一切新生活在是要。正確的宇宙觀和人生觀的指導下去創造的。</p>

<p>……沒有完美的性生活不會生育健美可愛的兒童　……根治男女雙方性能的障礙為種子的不二法門</p>
<p>我們不能否認：在私的方面，兒童是家庭的繼承人；在公約方面而言，則兒童又為社會的候補者。因此之故，生育健全的兒童實為國民應盡的天職。現代人的目光比較銳利了，所以大都能夠明瞭罹有不妊癥者是人類的恥辱，也是國家的損失，無怪歐美列強的積極獎勵生育，藉科學的萬能以拯救不妊癥者的悲慘。</p>
<p>要使每個男女都能生育，而且能產出健全的子女，我願本醫學的見地，來貢獻一點關於妊娠的必要知識。</p>
<p>生殖器官的機能依賴著生殖腺而繁榮，生殖腺健壯，在男子方面，精蟲運行得靈捷；在女子方面，卵珠的運動也很活潑；所以能夠相會合而完成受胎作用。自然這會合是以性行為的存在為前提的。因此，我們可知具有壯盛的生殖腺，能營美滿的性生活者，最易得到做父母的機會。根據了這條原則，我們可以考查出不妊的原因。不論在男子或女子方面，實際上即指性能缺陷而言。</p>
<p>在男子方面，性能的缺陷大抵是手淫，縱欲，冶遊的惡果。從很小的時候，便使生殖腺受手淫之害而受到障礙，結果，射精作用也失於約束，於是遺精早洩等現象相繼出現，甚至變成陽痿，不能營適當的性生活，精蟲運行呆滯，自然無法使婦女得胎。</p>
<p>冶逰而染上淋濁，性神經也要受到損傷，結果將與上述相同。</p>
<p>在女子方面，亦有因手淫或先天素弱而發生月經不調，生殖腺內分泌缺少，卵珠運行不靈，或白帶過多，或染得淋濁之癥，均能造成不孕的結果，使人只能徒然地仰天與嘆。</p>
<p>補救方法當設法恢復性能的健全，對男子之遺精，宜投以「希米脫氏固精片」，遺精可以立止。早洩陽痿及發育不全應投以生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，生殖機能即可亢進，使得營圓滿的性生活。對女子的月經不調等癥，須投以「女用生殖素」以調整之。白帶足以殺死精蟲，須用「療帶靈」以清除之。至於男女雙方同患的淋濁只有內服伐克辛和黃色素之和製劑「安敵淋」，方可透膜殺菌，使諸患全消。</p>
<p>（編者按：『生殖素』與『希米脫氏固精片』，真藥均裝鐵盒，近日市上奸商，不顧道德，以紙盒瓶裝之偽藥，謂名混銷，顧客務須認命鐵盒，庶免被欺。）</p>

<h3 id="c200">身體衰弱者之腰背酸痛症 <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士張君實</p>
<p>骨痛病之降臨絕非一朝半夕之事，許多年來積儲著的風濕和血毒方係真正的病根。這病根始終和健康作誓死的決戰，只有在健康已露敗態之時，他纔稍為露點頭角，這就是說：操勞略多，即覺腰背酸痛，係骨痛戰勝健康的第一聲。</p>
<p>健康能夠支持殘局，骨痛發展得也就慢些，如果健康一敗塗地，那麼滿身骨節酸痛屢屢發作，逐漸逼近半身不遂，動脈硬化之險境。</p>
<p>因此，平日體格素弱之人，於用力操作或縱欲之後，便覺得腰背酸痛，這就表示此人的健康有總崩潰的危險，骨痛病已循序前進地在逐步發展。</p>
<p>不要說日深一日的危機，就是屢背酸痛也夠消磨你的精神，破壞你的事業了。急速地去治療是必要的。</p>
<p>治療的方針，最重要的自然是採取力能深入骨節，祛濕除瘋，澄清血液的『強斯登氏骨痛片』，使患者內服，像一支強有力的軍隊似的，迅速撲滅病魔。這種療法係強斯登博士發明，全世界的醫界均認為確係骨痛病的唯一救星。</p>
<p>此外，我不是說過骨痛必先打敗健康方能出現的嗎？那么，增進健康，使抵抗力強固，在痊愈之前，可阻止其進展，已愈之後可絕再患之機。這就該服生殖腺素製劑的『生殖素』以促進身體之強壯了。</p>
<p>戒煙研究</p>
<h3 id="c201">安全戒煙法的獲得 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— 余伯符醫師</p>
<p>煙毒好像一棵大樹，存在的日子愈長，樹根愈深入泥中，蟠根錯節，分支眾多，牢不可拔。煙毒的存在何嘗不如此，時期愈長，愈能深入軀體的各部組織，使之麻醉。漸漸地，本來生龍活虎似的生命力變得麻木呆滯，只有在煙霞的刺激驅使下，方能照常活動。於煙毒遂成為生命的主宰，吸食者永久淪為奴隸。</p>
<p>煙民們，想一想罷，你們之成為奴隸，不是自己去引狼入室的嗎？現在呢？偷偷的吸食，冒著被捉將官裏去的危險，偶然無暇吸食，便再體內與風作浪，鬧得你涕淚交流，痛苦難忍，不管你的事忙，不問你在外作客，更不顧你有錢無錢，都是一樣的作怪。吸完你的脂膏，侵蝕你的健康。對於這樣兇殘的主人，度著非人生活的奴隸應當奮起反抗。</p>
<p>最有效安全的戒煙法當推生殖腺製劑『生殖素』，他能夠以新的生命力灌輸給你，使麻木呆滯的各部組織重新潑刺有生氣，製劑能靈活的運動，擺脫煙毒的束縛，自然見煙自厭，不想再從煙霞中乞取辦事的精神了。有恃無恐，便可以使侵蝕生命的煙毒望風披靡。至於在戒除期中，常有的遺精病，也可服「希米脫氏固精片」，立能停止，為極好的補助藥。</p>
<p>有患者申傅林，年三十四歲，前與損友為伍，藥得煙癮，致身體日弱，困頓不堪，欲戒不得，經余投以「生殖素」，僅五星期，身體日佳，竟不思再吸，且經過毫無痛苦，故戒後的肌肉，遂強壯結實，精神充足健旺，完全恢復等常壯年人應有之狀態矣。</p>

<h3 id="c202">遺精的原因及其弊害研究 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>……遺精的原因當以手淫弊害為最悲慘而擴大　……嬰孩的喜歡撫弄性器官為父母者應該注意</p>
<p>手淫是與遺精癥有聯繫的關係。我並不是說沒有手淫的人是不會遺精的。因為沒有手淫惡癖的人，假若身體虛弱，疾病百出的青年，也照樣會有遺精癥的。反之，生理成熟時的強壯青年，每月也有一二次的遺精。所以要研究遺精的原因，如以造成弊害的結果而論，那末無疑地因手淫所造成者最為悲慘而眾多。</p>
<p>手淫在兩性春情發動時候是最盛行的一件惡習。起始，是由於身體某一部份性的激昂而生春情。然而那些地方使主要點呢？女性是在陰唇，乳房，陰核；男性則在龜頭，尿道；在兩性上，這幾種重要的器官，實具有末梢的神經。</p>
<p>對於性教育研究有素的醫生，大部一致承認手淫的惡癖，早在嬰孩在搖籃時已養成某種習慣了。讀者不必懷疑，當一個嬰孩睡在床上時，都喜歡撫弄著性器官，然後很快的就安睡了。幼孩繼續這種方法，到了春情發動期以後，變成手淫的惡習怪。</p>
<p>所以要澈底解決手淫弊害的滋生。一些實際的性教育，為父母的應該明瞭，如發現初生的小孩，有探弄陰部的習慣時，應設法為之避免，照這樣履行，我想成年時對於惡癖的減少，多少有些利益把！</p>
<p>最習見的弊害，手淫過度的青年，打都缺少良好的發育――陰莖細小，睾丸萎縮。因為良好的發育，完全視內分泌的旺弱以為斷。手淫之後，因為精神摧殘而鬆弛。因此遺精難免。內分泌的無限制浪費。自然要枯竭了。不僅性器的發育受阻。而精液枯竭的結果，生殖腺萎弱異常。陰萎，早洩相繼爆發。此種青年，對於婚後的幸福，早在此時喪失了。而且，辦事無力，精神頹唐，腦力遲鈍，失眠，健忘種種神經衰弱癥，不一而足。手淫遺精的弊害，實難盡述。</p>
<p>關於弊害的挽救。應先戒除手淫，然後服以鞏固精關，制止遺精的「希米脫氏固精片」，使遺精癥澈底治好。然而遺精所引起的早洩，陰萎，發育不全及精神衰弱等癥。必須同時服以生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」使生殖腺充分強壯。效驗如神。</p>
<p>性病講座</p>
<p>— 詹念曾醫師編撰</p>
<p>（診所）四川路北京路撞角中國信託公司二樓　門診上午十時至下午六時。星期日休息。</p>
<p>（一）陽痿治療重獲發育</p>
<p>患者湯國榮，年廿十七歲，因婚後房事無力，夫妻缺少快感。（主訴）…十六歲時在學校宿舍受劣友之引誘，致行交互手淫。施成習慣，每晚必實行手淫一次，致剛發育之年，大受摧殘。性器之發育受阻。局部細小異常，而遺精癥遂頻繁無虛夕。故不僅在校成績退化。廿四歲結婚，婚後雖得將惡癖戒絕，但因手淫遺精所引起的一切弊害，完全醞釀成熟，根深蒂固。故同房花燭之夜即患早洩癥。但使人最不幸者，竟不能運續舉行第二次房事的能力，故婚後之數年來，完全在悲慘中過生活。（現在病狀）…陰毛稀少，攝護線，生殖腺均可惡癖所摧殘，完全陷於萎弱狀態。（治療方法）…診得湯君病根在於生殖腺之衰弱，精關的鬆弛，故除每日施行電療之外，服以增強生殖腺能力的生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」使性器的發育轉佳，性能增強，同時再以「希米脫氏固精片」鞏固其精關，使其遺精停止。不到兩月，湯君的性器增大四分之一，陽痿，早洩及遺精癥業已完全消失矣。</p>
<p>（二）手淫早婚包莖不育</p>
<p>患者徐生明，年廿九歲，江蘇溧陽人。（主訴）…十五歲時即有手淫惡癖，十九歲即結婚，且婚後房事過度，性神經衰弱異常，故遺精癥迄未稍疏。況性器發育不全，不僅細小又有包莖。排尿時，尿先注於包皮間，而後再出包皮間排出。射精時亦然，極度不快。（現在癥狀）…陰莖，睾丸，攝護腺等皆發育不良。反射機能亢進，性神經衰弱癥及神經衰弱癥均全。且罹第三度包莖，祗龜頭前端露一微細孔道。（治療之法）…行手術割除包莖，使包皮後退，縫合缺口，并以「希米脫氏固精片」治其遺精癥。同時服以「生殖素」治其性弱及神經衰弱癥與發育不全等，經過兩月完全治愈。</p>

<p>— 香港大學醫科學士吳大超</p>
<p>每個女郎都願意讓人家讚上一聲：「真漂亮。」於是千方百計地去尋求嗎，美貌的方法，凃脂抹粉遂成為女界的通習。然而脂粉難道就絕對能化醜為美嚒？不，完全是不可能的。</p>
<p>枯黃瘦瘠的臉上塗滿了粉，在她自以為得意，卻不料別人正在罵她醜人多做怪哩。一旦偶然露出真面目，依舊醜惡，雖善化裝也是無法。並且現代關於美的觀念，決不單注意面貌美，反之，以姿態美為第一要件，顯明的曲綫，結實的皮膚，豐腴的乳房，必須高聲而有彈力，這豈是任何脂粉所能打扮成功的嗎？</p>
<p>運動場上，游泳池裏，脂粉沒有立足之地，真正時代的健康美麗顯露出來，何曾需要半點矯飾。不錯，許多的女子確是熱烈地歡迎著如此的美，只因無法得到，不得不以脂粉來作掩飾之具。對於這等人，我們願盡力勸其服生殖線素製劑「女用生殖素」可以使生殖腺發達，身體各部皆得完美地發育，萎癟的乳峰可以變為高聳，枯乾粗糙的皮膚會化為柔滑豐腴，各部肢體發育均衡，曲綫自可畢露，如此，既具備一切姿態之美，自足動人，何需脂粉！</p>
<p>至於瘦弱之起於白帶者，宜兼用「療帶靈」，以止白帶；若曾患淋病，宜內服伐克新與黃色素之合製劑「安敵淋」方妥。</p>

<p>不論何種疾病，必有其病源。然同一疾病，而其病源亦有互異的。如本文所述骨節酸痛一癥，蓋本癥的病源。約有數種，故治療的能否有效。先決問題，須視所服之藥其含蓄的藥力。是否能統治其所有病源以為斷。譬似患者因風濕內蘊致爆發本癥。如以花柳餘毒的骨痛法治之。則必無益而有害。反之，亦流弊百出，因此之故。早年因冶逰而罹患淋病者。如一旦發生骨節酸痛感覺。則其治法應以清除血分為第一。必須服以黃色素和伐克新合製劑「安敵淋」使其殘留於黏膜內層的淋病，澈底掃除盡絕。然後服以「強斯登氏骨痛片」，使骨節輕鬆，筋絡舒適，雖病至半身不遂，不難頓告痊愈也。</p>
<p>患者吳敏生，年卅九歲，十年前曾患過三年白濁，故近年全身骨節發生疼痛。雖曾照普通骨痛法治療，絕無效驗，旋得醫師指導服以「安敵淋」及「強斯登氏骨痛片」之後，因淋病的餘毒掃清，而「強斯登氏骨痛片」又能祛濕，除濕，清血及預防動脈硬化的功效。故不久即得恢復健康云、</p>

<h3 id="c209">校長改業郵差 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— 無次</p>
<p>校長，據說是一個「肥缺一，尤其是公立學校，可是現在這「肥缺」似乎述「鷄肋」都比不上，因爲鷄肋雖然食之無味，棄之到底可惜，而現在竟有認校長不及郵差，棄之一點都不可惜的。倘若不信，有報爲憑：</p>
<p>溫嶺通訊：本縣西區莞消蔡小學（卽前縣立第五小學）校長王雲高……現因牛活程度日高，以每月十數元之收入，實不足以維持生計，乃於前日考入溫嶺郵局郵差，昨聞王君對於校長一職，業經向縣政府呈請辭職……」</p>
<p>這裏的校長，其實應該稱小學校長，說得更恰當一點，應該是內地小學校長。因爲，大學校長坐汽車，住洋房很多很多，卽某些公私立中小學校校長，也都豐衣足食，未聞有對敎育事業表示灰心，而必拂袖去之而後快的。</p>
<p>讀者如果不健忘，總該記得在調動校長的時候，這一派和那一派，這一系有特殊效騐</p>
<p>和那一系的窮兇極惡，你爭我搶，甚至有打破頭顱，亂開手槍等種種活劇，如果不是因爲校長」是個肥缺，何必要這樣一點不肯放鬆呢？可見「校長一當中，等級大有差異，而爲了這等級，更頭出某些人對敎育的特別熱心，雖被免職，仍肯負責到底；而某些人則唯利是視，棄之如遺。</p>
<p>於後者，我們就拿溫嶺莞渭蔡小學校長王雲高來做一個例。王雲高之不願當校長，爲的是月入不過十數元，而郵差大的總有二十元，所以王校長就寧可去當郵差了、校長與郵差之間，其品位與身份，相差不可以道里計，王雲高竟不顧身份名譽而價格以求，可見其確是一各功力主義者。再就服務的精神來說，郵差雖也是替大衆效勞，但究不及校長之爲國家社會造就人材來得更有意義。干雲高能够不顧一切而毅然决然地用去紗帽，證明了吃飯問題是無論如何要高於一切的。</p>
<p>「衣食足而後知禮義，」呌人餓癟了肚子去敎書等於敎乞丐去講廉恥一樣。中國的敎靑，雖則近年以來有着許多熱心敎育家在那裏鼓吹，提倡，可是這樣「熱心」的結果，只使多數平民沒有法子受中等敎育，而少數能够進學的，也不過是混一張文憑，充其量，造就到西洋去鍍金的賽格而已。要說入材，母乃類鳳毛麟角。</p>
<p>就說初等敎育吧，一般的現象是這樣，一個人不到窮極無聊不去當小學敎師，於是能够當郵差的便當郵差去了，剩下來的，有如軍隊裏的老弱殘兵一樣，只識得幾個字，或竟不識而也濫竽其問，所以中國的小學，多數不是「作育英材」而是戕戕殺英材」。對於王雲高君之另謀高就，以及某些坐汽車住洋房的敎育界名人，開口什麽敎育，閉口什麽敎育，眞令人欲哭無淚，啼笑俱非！</p>

<p>—遭遇之一—</p>
<p>船進了山口洋灣口，海水漸漸地淡了。</p>
<p>夜風柔柔地吹揚起來。落日在海面上反映出一幅浩大的輝光燦爛的局面，出海漁人搖着小舟回來了——夜風輕輕地吹送着那常要惹起入們無窮幽思的溫</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>柔的搖櫓聲，輕微地——咿呀——咿呀</p>
<p>人們都擠在一邊甲板上，一種複雜的情緒輕輕地扒搔在人們的心裏。岸上，灰藍的渾偉的山巒，葱鬱的林木，那精巧的塗着各種顏色的木房子，在金黃的夕暉裏好像要睡了般，無聲無色地漾起了一片寗靜的幸福的預兆。</p>
<p>船尾轟隆——轟隆——嘩啦——翻起了一堆濁黃的浪花，船在顫動中停下來了。</p>
<p>我走下了船，提着僅有的行李——一隻半新的假皮皮箱，在山口洋的狹隘黯暗的市衢上走了幾個鐘頭，然後，向衣袋裏塞入了幾塊「羅帝」註一）跨上了那輛黃色的老態龍鍾的長途汽車。</p>
<p>在車裏，我吞下了兩塊羅帝——便昏昏沉沉地睡起來了。幾天來的海上生活沒有使我安靜過，疲憊似乎一齊向我勃發起來了。查票的尼德蘭人推醒我，我下意識地遞過了車票，又茫然地酣睡起來。一位好心的同車人拍醒我的時候，已經——到了邦戞了。</p>
<p>我擦着睡意還濃的眼，天上，金黃的光輝已炫耀起來，照着我的背部微有點熱意。幾個服裝奇異樣子獰蠢的婆羅洲熟黎（註二）打我身邊走過，一種特別的氣味，幾乎使我打起噴嚏來。</p>
<p>我沿着一條小路走上了熱鬧的大伯公街。街的尾巴上，我找到了那使我懷着唯一的希望跨山渡水而來的百的地———一所規模並不大的雜貨商店。我興奮地毫不猶豫地跨進去。妣夫正在櫃台裏忙着抄寫什麽，店夥向我投射過來奇異的眼光。我走到櫃合前面——姐夫抬起頭，我似乎從他那久不見的圓胖胖的紅潤的臉上看出設麼了，幾乎想跳進去抱住他——狂喜起來。……然而，姐夫那冷冷地幾乎是沒有表情的眼光阻止了我，他簡單地向我吐出一句話：</p>
<p>「來了？」</p>
<p>我沒有回答，什麽東西深深地刺激着我，使我全身微地顫動起來：我想拖住姐夫的手，質問他爲什麼要這樣傷害了我的情感——然而我沒有這樣做，反而卑順地幾乎是乞憐地向他叙述起一切經過來，我告訴他怎樣向熟人們乞了盤川而且帶着怎樣一顆熱烈的心到婆羅洲來的……</p>
<p>「姐夫」我說——一顆淚珠突然滾下了鼻翼。「你給我工作，隨便什麽樣的工作吧——我自己會生活的。」</p>
<p>「靑年人，——現在什麼都變了，看着靑年們的墮落，我實在傷心。其實，爲什麽要這樣呢，每個人都是有自己的本分的呀！」</p>
<p>「這不是我們的問題，姐夫，你還是給我工作吧！我保證你，我是個很好的工人——不要以爲我是從學校裏跑出來的。」</p>
<p>姐夫長長地打了個呵欠。「你是個過分執固的人，這裏，你看吧——不會有適合你的工作！」</p>
<p>「不——並不，」我幾乎大聲呌喊出來。「祗要是工作，隨便你打發我到什麼地方去吧——我都是適合的。」</p>
<p>姐夫沉默起來，輕微地鐘擺一樣地擺着頭，一隻手拈起了那枝筆——寫起來了。</p>
<p>傍晚關店門的時候，姐夫遞過了五盾錢，用那冷酷的沒有表情的音調重重地給了我一箭一樣的致命傷：</p>
<p>「你就趁來的船回去吧，姐姐的墓你不用去了，——車八點十分就要開，早點去也許可以佔個好位子。」</p>
<p>我茫茫地站在昏黃的煤油燈下，我想哭，又想痛快地大笑一番——突然我搶了過來姐夫手上的錢，提了皮箱——衝了出去。……</p>
<p>街上，迷濛着一片夜氛，婆羅洲渾偉的大山巒正用牠巍然的陰影黯暗地俯視着一切。商店已關上了木門，從板隙間透出一絲淡黃的光綫。</p>
<p>我大踏着步，一隻手還緊抓着那張紙盾，身上，微微地感到婆羅洲海風的陰凉了。</p>
<p>註一：羅帝，馬來語：麵包。</p>
<p>註二：婆羅洲野人有兩種——一種終年匿居深山，茹毛飮血，一種散居山麓，與人通。前者曰：生黎，後者稱：熟黎。</p>
<h3 id="c213">第一屆全國漫畫展覽觀後感 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 徐疾</p>
<p>（「亂代之微，文章匿而來」—茍子）</p>
<p>其實，不一定是文章；一切藝術，凡是產生在生當亂世的藝術家手裏的，都不免呈現着一種無可奈何的含笑的眼淚，然而這「無可奈何」，倒並不是說明了人們的眞正的無辦法，反之，却是表現了一代的藝術家們，曾努力於在無辦法中積極地找出辦法來。</p>
<p>這特徵，在現代，不特存在於一切特出的雜文中，也存在於新興的民衆藝術的漫畫中。</p>
<p>人是會變得更聰明起來的，於今，無論作文繪畫，是再也沒有在規定某些題材中兜圈子的作家了。把創作題材的範圍擴大起來，是一種可喜的現象。因爲，正如魯迅先生所說的，我們不但祗記得有「我們」，也須記得在我們之外還有「他們」：同樣，我們不特要描寫「偉大的工作」，也要描寫另一方面的「荒淫與無恥」。</p>
<p>這，在近年來的雜文版畫，與漫畫這三種新興的藝術上是相當地表現了的，雖然在技術上也許還不免有另外討論的餘地，然而亂世人的苦悶，與懷念光明的熱切，對於人間的卑汚的憎恨…等等是看得出來的。—卽使亂世的藝術是不免換上一付臉相了，然而這臉相，依舊使我們覺得比狗子的臉相崇高興可愛付多多。</p>
<p>這些情緒，在第一屆全國漫畫展覽會中的全部二百餘件作品中，是相當地看到了一點的。因爲我們還記得種種實際的困難，所以在這一點上，卽使有的時候還覺得未免有些「貧乏」，但也不再作過度的煩言了。</p>
<p>這次展覽會上面的「漫畫」這名稱是相當地廣義的。它不僅指一般的所謂「謔畫」（Cariture）（自然，在數量上，屬於這一類的是最多，）更包括「速寫（Sketch），書籍揷圖（如曹涵美的「金瓶梅」的工筆），甚至「標貼圖案」）全國漫展標貼）。而內容，也和形式一樣，是非常多方面的。缺少一種中心的氣質，似乎不能不說是一個遺憾了。在技術上有着高度的成就的，我們不能不提到曹涵美的「金瓶梅揷圖」，與張光宇的「掛枝兒」，此外葉淺予的「某女士像」，在子美的「黃柳霜」，張文元的「大觀園」也給了我們以很不易除去的好印象。然而使入驚心動魄的倒似乎不是這些纖美精緻的作品，三幅在技巧上運用了極大聰明，而給人以明白淸楚的主題的作品，應當舉出「國破山河在」（高龍生），「太極圖」（邵雨邨），與「只許州官放火」（林道盦（來。那種使人一望而而知的表現法，該是漫畫的主要的特質之一。我個人不大神往那種晦暗的，不大容易領會的東西。當然這是由於個人的藝術修養之貧乏，但我想如果漫畫眞應當是比較地屬於大衆的一種藝術的話，那未那種怪誕奧秘的筆觸，不是一條頂好的道路。近代的藝術家已經擺脫了一種奇怪的觀念，不再以自己的作品使人家看不懂爲自得的標的了。</p>
<p>爲了這一决的展覽會擁有着很多的觀衆，人們希望在藝術家的辛苦的工作下找尋到自己底苦痛，眼淚，呼聲，與安慰，這一點我想不是過度的要求吧？而在這一點上，當我們回憶起過去的版畫展覽會的時候，在內容的成就上，我們是不免有點苛求之感覺的。</p>
<p>然而，卽使如此，我們也看見了主持者與創作者們底的辛苦—在撕破了的地圖面前，我們更要求些什麽呢？</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Main Points Are Still Far Apart: The Future of Sino-Japanese Negotiations is Difficult to be Optimistic; Ambassador Xu Visits Arita to Explain Our Position; Japanese Telegram to Tianjin Seeks Opinions from Military Leaders; Military Affairs in Sui Will Not Affect Nanjing Negotiations <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Our Ambassador to Japan, Xu Shiying, acting on government orders, visited Japanese Foreign Minister Arita at 5:00 PM on the 11th for a two-hour meeting. Ambassador Xu repeatedly and sincerely explained our government's position, hoping that Japan would fully understand certain points. Arita also thoroughly explained the Japanese government's views and promised to reconsider the points raised by Ambassador Xu. This meeting did not reach a complete understanding. (Central News Agency telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A telegram from the central leadership in Japan arrived in Tianjin on the night of the 10th, seeking the opinions of the heads of the three military and naval organizations in Tianjin. Recognizing that Sino-Japanese diplomacy has now abandoned the "specialization of North China" and "joint anti-communism" concepts, the heads of the three military and naval organizations in Tianjin are exchanging opinions to prepare a response. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) As fighting has occurred in northern Suiyuan, a reporter specifically visited Mr. Matsumura, the secretary and spokesman of the Japanese Embassy, to inquire whether the Nanjing diplomatic negotiations would be suspended in the event of war in that area. Matsumura replied that the recent military affairs in Chahar and Suiyuan are matters between the official Chinese army and bandits, entirely a matter of Chinese internal affairs, and have nothing to do with Japan. Therefore, even if war occurs in that area, it will not affect the Nanjing negotiations. (Central News Agency telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy, although the opinions of Foreign Minister Zhang and Ambassador Kawagoe were slightly closer in their seventh meeting, the distance between the two sides' positions on several issues is still far. Negotiations must continue. Although the negotiations have been delayed for a long time, both governments seem to hope for a quick resolution. Therefore, Ambassador Kawagoe will not leave Nanjing before the negotiations come to a conclusion. (Central News Agency telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the Sino-Japanese negotiations, a person familiar with diplomatic affairs stated that since Foreign Minister Zhang and Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe began negotiations on September 15th, nearly two months have passed, and as many as seven meetings have been held. The twists and turns are not difficult to imagine. Our Foreign Minister Zhang has been persistent in striving for compromise, adhering to the government's established policy. Fortunately, the Japanese side has gradually come to understand our position and no longer insists on certain points. Therefore, in the seventh meeting on the 10th, the opinions of both sides were slightly closer. The content of the Sino-Japanese negotiations has many threads, and there are still many difficulties. The future is not very optimistic. Our diplomatic authorities can only adhere to the established policy in order to implement our will. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Newspaper Reports: Differing Accounts <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Local newspapers have different reports regarding the discussion of the "specialization of North China" and "joint anti-communism" issues during the meeting between Foreign Minister Zhang and Ambassador Kawagoe on the 10th. Some newspapers asserted that the negotiations had made some progress, but other newspapers said that China still adhered to its own position, so it was difficult to reach a compromise. The Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman declined to comment on the Nanjing negotiations on the morning of the 11th, stating that no official report had yet been received. The Shanghai special dispatch of the Jiji Shinpo stated that the two sides had reached a compromise, leaving the two major issues of North China and anti-communism for future negotiations, and temporarily establishing a conclusion on the points of mutual agreement. Regarding the resolution of the Chengdu and Beihai incidents, a committee may be organized to discuss solutions, so that they can be resolved separately as soon as possible. General observation here believes that the Nanjing negotiations seem to be able to come to an end after Foreign Minister Zhang and Ambassador Kawagoe hold one or two more meetings, and then Ambassador Kawagoe will go to Shanghai for recuperation. (Central News Agency telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) This morning, Japanese newspapers prominently published news about the meeting between Chinese Foreign Minister Zhang Qun and Japanese Ambassador to China Kawagoe in Nanjing yesterday. The Japanese side clearly hopes that the seventh meeting between the two will bring the long-delayed Sino-Japanese negotiations to an end, and hopes that Mr. Kawagoe can obtain a concrete decision on the results of more than fifty meetings between Chinese and Japanese diplomats to resolve disputes between the two countries. The above-mentioned Japanese hopes may not be fulfilled, because although there is news from a certain news agency that the meeting between the two has improved the situation of the negotiations, according to a report from a Nanjing correspondent of the Asahi Shimbun, the Chinese attitude expressed by Foreign Minister Zhang was unexpectedly strong. It is reported that the official report from Ambassador Kawagoe received late last night stated that the Chinese authorities insisted on two of the most important outstanding issues, namely the so-called "special status" of North China and Sino-Japanese cooperation against communism. It is heard that Foreign Minister Zhang requested Kawagoe to allow China to postpone answering the anti-communism issue for six months. The Asahi Shimbun continued to say that the Japanese government, in view of the world's trends, intends to force China to accept the above-mentioned proposal for joint anti-communism, and believes that Foreign Minister Zhang's claim is just a means to evade this issue. The Japanese government now believes that Sino-Japanese cooperation against communism is an important matter for consolidating the overall situation in East Asia. The newspaper also exaggeratedly claimed that the pro-Russian figures in China have significantly expanded. (Reuters telegram, 11th)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Suma Visits Gao for Informal Consultations <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) In order to further promote a quick resolution to negotiations after the results of the seventh Zhang Qun-Kawagoe talks on the 10th, Consul General Suma visited Director Gao Zongwu at his private residence at 3:00 PM on the 11th. The content of the talks is being kept strictly confidential by both China and Japan, but it is confirmed that the opinions of both sides are not yet fully aligned, so it may be possible to gain some clarity after two or three more meetings in the future.

<p>(Guihua) Li Shouxin's troops in Nanhouchu have been attacking between Xinghe and Fengzhen several times every day, but have been repelled by the garrison forces. Another 20,000 puppet state troops and a certain regular army have arrived in Duolun and are heading towards Shangdu, carrying more than 200 tanks and armored vehicles, which will be allocated to Li and Wang Ying's troops. Wang's troops are getting 60 vehicles, and Zhang Wanqing's brigade is remobilizing more than 2,000 soldiers and are marching from Dagou towards Bailingmiao. In addition, because a certain country is eager to plot against Suiyuan, they have decided to update Wang Ying's outdated military equipment and have transported new-style guns and fourteen heavy trucks to Bailingmiao. Starting this month, the amount of military pay for the Mongol puppet bandits will be increased. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to news received here today, the situation in Suiyuan is extremely tense. "The Manchu-Mongol army attacked several Chinese defense lines yesterday with the cover of aircraft and the assistance of tanks, but ultimately failed and retreated after suffering damage. Although these attacks were somewhat more determined than before, the scope of the war is not yet widespread. It is expected that the Manchu-Mongol army will not launch a large-scale invasion until various supplies are concentrated. Several Japanese military trucks are currently transporting food from Zhangjiakou to the north, and they are very busy. It is heard that similar goods are currently being transported from Rehe to Chahar Province. The weather is very cold in the area where the war is taking place in eastern Suiyuan. Heavy snow has fallen and severe frost is approaching. It is believed that if a major war occurs, the Manchu-Mongol army's invasion goals will be threefold: first, Pingdiquan, which would allow the Manchu-Mongol army to cut off the Ping-Sui Railway; second, Guihua; and third, Baotou. However, according to several sources here, the current invasion by the Manchu-Mongol army is purely a means to put the Chinese government in a difficult position in the Sino-Japanese negotiations. (Reuters telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Dai Qinglian, a representative of the Mongolian leagues and banners stationed in Beijing, met with Secretary-General Weng at 10:00 AM on the 11th and reported in detail on the Mongolian affairs in the Suiyuan region. It is heard that De Wang sent a telegram to Beijing to defend himself against external rumors that he personally participated in the activities of the puppet bandits invading Suiyuan. This telegram came from the north. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Suiyuan received in Beiping stated that a portion of the puppet bandit troops in Shangdu, Taolin, and other places have been moving westward in recent days, concentrating towards Bailingmiao, with the intention of peeking at Baotou. The intention seems to be to use the line between Bailingmiao and Shangdu to invade Suiyuan from three sides, taking a surround formation. It is heard that there have already been small contacts. People from Pingdiquan say that the puppet bandit troops, in view of the strong defenses of our army in eastern Suiyuan, are focusing on northern Suiyuan in recent days, centering on Bailingmiao, and increasing the number of tanks and heavy artillery. Bailingmiao is about 330 miles away from Guihua. The north of Wuchuan is mostly plains, and Daqingshan is quite steep. Rumors are rampant in Pingdiquan these days, and the authorities are strictly prohibiting them. Miao Yutian, Chief of Staff of the 35th Army, and Zeng Yan'yi, Brigade Commander of the same army, arrived in Beiping a few days ago to take care of personal affairs. They have transferred to Tianjin and are scheduled to return to Suiyuan via Beiping within a few days to report everything to General Fu Zuoyi. According to Miao, the border of Suiyuan is tense, and Fu Zuoyi is determined to maintain the territory, as he has been ordered by the country to be responsible for defending the land. If puppet bandits come to invade, he will resolutely and severely suppress them. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) People from Guisui said that the puppet army of Li Shouxin, Wang Ying, and others are concentrating as much as possible in Bailingmiao and Shangdu, with the aim of attacking east of Pingdiquan. However, the bandit forces are complex internally, and their equipment is incomplete. They are currently replenishing their equipment on one hand, and on the other hand, cavalry bandits are scouting ahead, resulting in occasional contact between outposts. The time for a large-scale general attack has not yet arrived. The puppet troops at the front are constantly spreading rumors, saying that they will attack today, or that they will launch a general attack tomorrow, with the intention of confusing the army's morale. The Jin-Sui army has made extremely tight arrangements at the front. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) News from eastern Suiyuan stated that there have been continuous small conflicts between the Chinese army defending Suiyuan and the Mongol "Manchu" troops. However, the war will not expand in the short term. Many Japanese military trucks are currently transporting food from Zhangjiakou to the north, presumably for the invading troops. It is also heard that a large amount of food is being transported from Rehe to Chahar. Judging from the current situation, the Manchu-Mongol army will probably not launch a large-scale invasion until various supplies are concentrated. The conflicts that have occurred between the two sides are obviously the result of the Manchu-Mongol army testing the strength of the garrison. (Reuters, 11th)</p>

The truth about the resolution is that both the Japanese and the landlord are willing to settle peacefully. It was agreed that Wang Junde, the original tenant, would bear the cost of repairing the rented house. The Japanese would voluntarily remove the wooden sign at the door. Tanaka Yoshitaro would move out of the house that day, and the landlord would take back the house.

<h3 id="e26">Weng Wenhao Issues Statement: The Executive Yuan Decides on Detailed Measures for the Grain Issue; Provincial Security Commissioners to Actively Improve <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Weng Wenhao made an important statement to reporters from the Central News Agency on the morning of the 12th, saying that the government's current anti-banditry work is extremely urgent. To facilitate military operations, Suiyuan, Qinghai, and parts of Inner Mongolia have been designated as anti-banditry zones. This is because the bandits are in a precarious situation and attempting to cause disturbances, and there is concern that the safety of foreign residents within these areas may be affected. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has instructed various embassies in China to pay attention and ordered relevant agencies and local governments not to issue travel passports for the designated areas. The government will not be responsible for protecting those who travel there without authorization. Regarding the recent rumors spread by a certain newspaper in Shanghai that the government has decided to reorganize self-opening commercial ports and separately preserve or abolish them, preserving places like Wusong and Pukou (twenty places) and abolishing places like Wuxi and Changde (twelve places), with an announcement to be made soon, he had inquired with the relevant departments and agencies and found no such proposal. At the same time, the government had never intended such a plan, so the reported facts are baseless and purely fabricated. Furthermore, the recent soaring of grain prices in various places is not a good sign in a year of harvest. The government should urgently regulate prices to make them reasonable. The Ministry of Finance had planned to convene a meeting to discuss this, but due to the unresolved issue of grain transportation and sales, the meeting was postponed indefinitely. The Executive Yuan now plans to convene representatives from relevant ministries in the coming days to discuss this matter. According to his opinion, the inflow and outflow of grain between provinces is reasonable under normal circumstances. However, the issue of exporting grain abroad requires careful consideration, so the Yuan decided to formulate detailed measures during the meeting. Premier Chiang recently stated that the implementation of the provincial security system has incurred huge expenses, placing an excessive burden on the people and resulting in low administrative efficiency. He ordered active improvement. The Executive Yuan has issued a circular to all provinces, urging them to quickly reorganize, save expenses, reduce personnel, and make decisive cuts within three months. Since few provinces have submitted reports, the Yuan reissued an order a few days ago for thorough implementation. It is hoped that after the abolition of the security system, all funds will be used to establish police academies, develop police administration, and it has recently been decided to merge the Hangzhou and Shanghai police academies into the Nanjing police academy to centrally train police personnel, so that the national police system can be universally implemented to maintain public order. This work has already begun and tangible results can be seen in the short term. Recently, in order to thoroughly study the efficiency of local administration, the Executive Yuan published "Administrative Research" and invited administrative scholars and experts from across the country to study ten major issues, including local finance and construction, land tax, commissioners, district offices, public security, baojia, household registration, grain, and provincial enterprises. Once a sound plan is developed, it will be submitted to the Premier for approval and implementation. The Executive Yuan recently also noted that central broadcasting services are very well-developed, but few local areas are using them. A circular was issued to all counties, requiring them to purchase and install broadcasting equipment within this year without delay, as this would greatly benefit local administrative reform. (Central News Agency dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Second Grain Conference of the Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Finance, and the Central Trust Bureau, the date is still undecided. A certain expert said, regarding our country's grain situation in the past, the domestic production only accounted for the domestic demand, and there was a shortage of about two thousand dan of rice and two thousand dan of wheat annually. There was surplus grain in the inland, while there was a shortage of grain in the coastal areas. The lack of wheat was universal, and some flour mills could not help but use foreign wheat due to quality reasons. However, if the wheat-producing areas of the northwest provinces could have convenient transportation and find ways to establish inland warehouses and proper regulation, the quantity distribution could gradually become more balanced. As for the rice situation, in the past, because Hunan rice could not be sold, the areas that felt the most shortage, such as Guangdong Province, accounted for about 60%. However, if the annual shortage of two thousand dan is calculated with the population of our country, each person only lacks one thousandth of a dan, which is a very small number and can be easily balanced by adjusting, promoting production, and is not difficult to make up for. Therefore, regarding the issue of peacetime adjustment, on the one hand, efforts should be made to avoid disasters such as droughts, floods, and insect pests, and on the other hand, the burden on farmers should be reduced. At the same time, because grain prices have fallen almost every year since the twentieth year and in the last five years, and in the twenty-first year, they were slightly stimulated and rose due to floods. The reason is due to foreign dumping, but efforts should be made to raise prices in the future so that farmers can have profits and increase production. Then, with the power of the government, with convenient transportation and finance, use sales methods to adjust surpluses and deficits to achieve balance. After three years of effort, there will definitely be promising results. The grain storage done in various places this year has progressed compared to last year. Last year's grain storage was over 8 million dan, and this year's is over 11 million dan. The quantity occupied by agricultural warehouses is currently not statistically available, but it is still less than the total amount stored in grain storage. (Special dispatch, 11th)</p>

<p>In order to promote the province's culture and advance scholarship, and in accordance with the instructions of the Department of Education, the Zhejiang Provincial Library held the Zhejiang Literature Exhibition starting on November 1st. The opening ceremony was held one day prior, and in addition to representatives from various agencies, most of the respected scholars and elders of Hangzhou City attended. The exhibition started on the 1st, and there were many visitors because it was a Sunday. It has been eight days now. Every day from 9 AM to 5 PM, visitors have been shoulder to shoulder, making it a grand occasion. The total number of visitors has reached more than 30,000. People from other cities who heard the news and made a special trip to Hangzhou to visit included Jiang Fucong and Liu Yizheng from Nanjing, Ye Gongchuo, Yao Yuqin, Zhang Qinbo, Liu Haisu, Wang Xiaolai, Zhang Boan, and Pan Boshan and Jiang Jinghuan from Suzhou. Some came from as far away as Nanchang and Hankou. There were many individuals or groups from various parts of Zhejiang Province who came to visit. The association spent half a year preparing, and also set up collection branches in various commissioner districts of Zhejiang Province and in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places. The provincial library repeatedly sent staff to communicate and borrow items, so it was able to collect many treasures, making it a grand sight. The collected items were originally divided into six groups: books, calligraphy and paintings, images, bronze and stone rubbings, antiques, and national revolutionary literature. The so-called revolutionary literature could originally include the writings, portraits, calligraphy, and relics of meritorious national pioneers and sages in Zhejiang. However, it was intended to be displayed in a separate room in order to stimulate the national spirit, so it was made a separate group. Since the solicitation began, there have been many responses from within and outside the province. During the compilation and display, the items were roughly classified, such as local sage writings, provincial gazetteers, engraved books, book collection literature, imperial examination literature, local sage calligraphy and paintings (including hand-written albums), local sage portraits, local sage relics, provincial antiques, bronze and stone rubbings, scenic photographs and charts, national revolutionary literature, and folk literature. Combining the items collected from various sources with those self-collected by the provincial library, there were more than 9,000 types and more than 20,000 items. Among them: (1) Local sage writings, including manuscripts, transcribed copies, annotated copies, and rare published copies, with manuscripts being the most numerous and valuable. Such as the Collected Works of Xu Wei of Shanyin, Zhang Dai's Shiku Shu, Cha Chuba's Poetry and Prose Manuscripts, Lu Wenchao's Poetry Manuscripts, and Sun Yirang's Ming Yuan. There are countless original manuscripts of published books such as Qi Zhaonan and Huang Yizhou; transcribed copies include Feng Fang's Record of Lu Poetry Shixue, annotated copies mainly from the Yuhailou in Ruian. (2) Provincial gazetteers, in addition to those owned by the Zhejiang Library itself, include the collections of the Tianyige, Jiayelou, Beijing Library, and Wang Shoushan. New and old gazetteers of various prefectures and counties in Zhejiang Province are almost completely collected. Among them, the Song dynasty carved Siming Zhi and Jiading Chicheng Zhi are valuable. As for the Jingji Zhi, Jinshi Zhi, genealogical records, local sage biographies, and county and city series of books in various parts of Zhejiang Province, they are all brilliantly prepared. Among them, the genealogical records include the Song dynasty genealogy of the Chen family of Zhuji, which is valuable. (3) Engraved book literature, ranging from the Baoxieyin Dharani Sutra published in the Later Zhou dynasty, the Wu Yue Leifeng Pagoda Sutra, and the Song Lin'an Shupeng edition, the Yuan Qingyuan Road edition, the West Lake Academy edition, to the Ming and Qing dynasties Zhejiang fine engravings, which can be viewed as the history of Zhejiang province engraving. (4) Book collection literature, with Zhejiang province's private book collections being very prosperous, especially during the Ming and Qing dynasties. The items displayed this time, such as Qi's Danshengtang, Fan's Tianyige, Xiang's Wanjintang, Zhu's Pushuting, Sun's Shousongtang, Zhu's Jieyilu, Bao's Zhibuzu Studio, and Ding's Baqianjuanlou, are a collection of old books from famous Zhejiang book collectors, making it a magnificent sight. (5) Imperial examination literature, with the township and metropolitan examination records of the Ming and Qing dynasties as the main items. The township and metropolitan examination records of the Ming dynasty borrowed from Fan's Tianyige are the most numerous. In addition, there are the original drafts of the metropolitan examination notes of Qi Biaojia's father and son, the Xiangshi Luming banquet cup, and the imperial guards, which are all cultural relics related to the imperial examinations. (6) Local sage calligraphy and paintings, the valuable works collected are difficult to count. More than 500 pieces were selected for display at the meeting, including paintings by Wu Zhonggui and Qian Shunju in the Yuan dynasty, and Ren Daoxun, Xu Wenchang, Guan Jiusi, Xiang Kongzhang, Chen Hongshou, Mao Xihe, Dai Chunshi, and Chen Hongshou in the Qing dynasty, Song Zi, Ming Qian Sule, Ni Yuanlu's books, and many famous handwritings such as Wang Yangming, Liu Jishan, Zhu Zhuting Hang Dazong, Dai Chunshi, Jiang Ximing, etc. are valuable. There are fifty hand scrolls, or famous paintings or commemorative cultural relics, with inscriptions by famous artists, which are beautiful. To list the main ones, there are hand scrolls by Qian Shumei, Wang Yuanzhang, Fang Chunniang, etc., which are all easy to obtain works. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e52">Commemoration of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Birthday <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Today is the commemoration of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday. Dr. Sun Yat-sen was the creator of the Chinese Revolutionary Party and the creator of the Republic of China. Dr. Sun Yat-sen had a consistent and broad revolutionary doctrine, an indomitable and persistent revolutionary spirit, and a selfless and great personality. Dr. Sun Yat-sen was able to accept valuable lessons from history and constantly enrich the content of his revolutionary doctrine and revolutionary strategy according to the needs of objective facts. The National Revolution advocated by Dr. Sun Yat-sen for forty years is still the theme of the Chinese revolutionary problem. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary doctrine and teachings are still deeply imprinted in the minds of the Chinese people. We only see Dr. Sun Yat-sen's piercing eyes and great and lofty personality. Dr. Sun's birth was the appearance of the savior of the Chinese nation. Now, although this bright savior has unfortunately fallen, the sparks burst out by the savior remain in the world like torches.</p>
<p>Today, as we commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday, it is a time when foreign troubles are deepening and the Chinese nation has reached a critical juncture of life and death. Therefore, in response to the current crisis, all Chinese who admire Dr. Sun Yat-sen should accept Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary doctrine and revolutionary spirit to continue to struggle and implement his valuable teachings to resolve the current national crisis and save the Chinese nation from subjugation.</p>
<p>What are the valuable teachings that Dr. Sun Yat-sen showed us?</p>
<p>First, Dr. Sun Yat-sen once said, "The Three Principles of the People are the doctrine of saving the country... Why do we say that the Three Principles of the People are the doctrine of saving the country? Because the Three Principles of the People are to promote China's equal international status, equal political status, and equal economic status, so that China can permanently survive in the world. Therefore, we say that the Three Principles of the People are the doctrine of saving the country." (The First Lecture on the Three Principles of the People and Nationalism) Now is the time to save the country and survive. The Three Principles of the People are by no means empty ideals, but the broad road that the Chinese revolution should take. Therefore, to realize the Three Principles of the People, the first step is to "save the country," that is, to save the country and survive. As the saying goes, "If the skin is gone, what will the hair cling to?" Today, as we commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday, our only task is to resist foreign aggression and defend the integrity of our territory.</p>
<p>Second, Dr. Sun Yat-sen told us in his will, "I have devoted myself to the national revolution for forty years. With forty years of experience, I know deeply that to achieve this goal, we must awaken the people... and fight together." In his repeated lectures, he repeatedly clarified the importance of "sovereignty in the people." In the declaration of going north, he further said, "From today onwards, we should inaugurate a new era of national revolution, so that the phenomenon of military force combining with imperialism will never appear in the country, and what will replace it will be the phenomenon of the first step of combining military force with the people, and the second step of making military force the military force of the people." At the same time, "Regarding the current situation, we advocate convening a national conference to seek China's unification and construction." Now is the time to gather the strength, wisdom, financial resources, and material resources of the whole country to save China from destruction. Therefore, as we read Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will, we sincerely hope that the government will lead the people, and the people will pledge to be the government's support, to rescue the dying China. To achieve this step, we naturally cannot lack the spirit of the Principle of People's Livelihood advocated by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, because only in this way can we make the "lower sentiments" "reach the top" and "unite the whole country with sincerity" to "go to the national crisis together."</p>
<p>Third, Dr. Sun Yat-sen repeatedly said when he was dying, "Peaceful struggle to save China." Dr. Sun Yat-sen was a pacifist, and his ultimate ideal was world communism. Dr. Sun Yat-sen also said in his will, "Unite with the nations of the world that treat me equally and fight together." Now the whole world is in the midst of a melee between the peace camp and the aggression camp. In order to protect the peace of East Asia and resist the enemy's aggression, between "enemy or friend," we should always uphold Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings to seek friends of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>The above three points are all what the far-sighted Dr. Sun Yat-sen taught us long ago. When we commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday, we can only implement his teachings to be worthy of Dr. Sun Yat-sen.</p>

<p>(Moscow) The Soviet Union has discovered a large-scale conspiracy aimed at organizing a Fascist group, leading to Soviet police conducting extensive searches for conspirators throughout the country. According to official authorities, numerous foreign nationals have been arrested, including residents of German, Austrian, Swedish, Polish, and other nationalities. They are accused of propagating Fascist ideology and engaging in other activities detrimental to Soviet interests. A Berlin newspaper's Moscow correspondent telegraphed his office stating that the reason for the panic among the Soviet political police is currently unknown. However, besides Moscow, other locations in the Soviet Union are also taking precautionary measures. The correspondent further stated that five Germans are among those arrested. (Reuters, 11th)</p>

<h3 id="e56">Litvinov's Speech: Soviet Union Self-Assured and Fearless, "Pot is Full, Not Afraid of Isolation," World Cannot Have Peace Without the Soviet Union <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov's diplomatic achievements are outstanding, and the government has awarded him the highest-level Order of Lenin. Today, upon receiving the award, Litvinov stated that the Soviet Union is militarily superior to any enemy or coalition of enemies and therefore fears no isolation. He also knows that other countries cannot have peace without the Soviet Union; therefore, the isolation of the Soviet Union is not a problem. Other European countries, if isolated, will not be able to resist aggression. The Soviet Union can calmly wait for other countries to choose their path. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Foreign Minister Litvinov firmly stated that the Soviet Union is determined to maintain peace and that there are only two policies in international relations: one is collective security, and the other is compromise with aggressors. One of these two must be chosen. The Soviet Union is now relying on its own strength within the country and observing which path Europe will take. However, the Soviet Union knows that other countries cannot achieve peace without the Soviet Union. He concluded by saying that the problem today is not isolating the Soviet Union but isolating European countries, making them unable to defend themselves and subjected to the trampling of aggressors.

<p>(Moscow) The Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union held a meeting on the 10th of this month and awarded the Order of Lenin to People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov. Upon receiving the medal, Litvinov gave a speech stating: "When I follow the instructions of our party leader, Stalin, and strive to do my best to benefit our great socialist motherland, I am also serving all of humanity. The reason is that bourgeois views often hold that diplomats are solely specialists in lying to protect their own country's interests, while the characteristic of Soviet diplomats is to always tell the truth, not only for the benefit of their own country but also for the benefit of all of humanity's workers. Soviet diplomacy is the struggle for peace, and peace is what all of humanity needs. The foundation of Soviet foreign policy is forever unchanging. In 1919, when I first went abroad on a Soviet diplomatic mission, my task was to propose peace to certain countries who were then attacking the Soviet Republic, attempting to interfere in its internal affairs and enslave its workers and peasants, just as certain countries are now mistreating Spain. At that time, proposing peace could be misunderstood as a sign of weakness, but we still proposed it. Now, this kind of misunderstanding will not happen again. The world has deeply believed in our country's inviolable power and infinite self-defense capabilities, but we still propose peace and constantly propose peace. When we participated in the first international conference, we proposed universal disarmament. Since then, even though our military strength has grown stronger day by day, our military industry and our fighting potential make us superior to any possible enemy, or the combined forces of many enemies, we still reiterate this proposal and reiterate it at every opportunity. Our armament is not to wage war with anyone, but to prevent others from having the desire to boldly try force with us. For the same purpose, we have proposed to all countries, one by one, the best system for organizing universal peace. I insist that it is universal because we not only hope that our country can enjoy peace but also that all of humanity can enjoy peace. Since our proposal for universal disarmament, which we have always regarded as the most important and indispensable guarantee of peace, was abandoned, we have proposed a system for guaranteeing peace, namely, treaties of non-aggression between neighboring countries, local pacts for collective defense against aggressors, the international definition of aggression, and the strengthening of international solidarity based on the League of Nations. Many journalists and politicians believe that this peace organization has already gone bankrupt, but this is completely false and is merely another official method of opposing peace. This organization has not yet been realized, and the struggle to have it accepted is still ongoing. How can one immediately say that it has already gone bankrupt? Currently, besides the Soviet Union, are there any other countries that have concluded non-aggression treaties with their neighbors? Even if there are, are they truly doing so in a spirit of peace, rather than using it as a means to frankly cover their rear and flanks for aggressive purposes? Our definition of aggression has so far only been accepted by our neighboring countries and has not been universally recognized internationally. When a member of the League of Nations recently attacked another member, we had to argue at the League of Nations that there was indeed an act of aggression, and this debate made the general measures against the aggressor numb. As for the concept of local pacts, it seems that most European countries have accepted it in theory. But where are these pacts? At the same time, the strengthening of the League of Nations, which most countries have vowed to support, has been delayed forever month after month and year after year under various pretexts, yielding no results. If one must speak of bankruptcy, then bankrupt are the policies of those countries that outwardly accept the Soviet Union's proposals, constantly declare their support for collective security, the indivisibility of peace, the stability of the principles of the League of Nations, and local pacts, but in reality, they are slacking off on these concepts. Bankrupt are the policies of those governments that believe that preparing to resist imminent aggression can only be carried out with the consent and participation of an aggressor who is known to all. Bankrupt are the policies of those governments that ignore violations of international treaties, ignore unquestionable acts of aggression, and instead flatter the perpetrators of these acts, catering to their will, hoping that they will be satisfied with their gains and declare, 'We will not commit any more crimes.' However, history has already told us that aggression and expansion never have a time of satisfaction. Every success, every concession obtained, will be used by the aggressor for new attacks. A policy of cowardly concessions to aggressors only emboldens them even more. Currently, the organization of collective security, the conclusion of regional pacts, and even joint diplomatic steps are all avoided, for fear that the aggressor will see this as forming a bloc. However, the aggressor himself sneers at this maliciously and forms his own bloc. Thus, those countries that previously claimed to be neutral arbiters also feel threatened and have to hastily arm themselves to avoid this danger. Whose policy is bankrupt, is it not clear? We have every reason to assume that many countries have begun to learn lessons from this bankruptcy. But the choices of routes are too few, there are only two: one is the Soviet Union's proposal for collective security, in which all peaceful countries organize a collective defense to resist the few and not-so-fearsome aggressors; the other is the route proposed by the aggressors and their agents in various countries, which has gained enthusiastic support, especially among medium-sized and small countries, namely, the so-called route of compromise with the aggressors, which is actually a compromise between the shrimp and the shark, hoping that the shark will not swallow them whole in one bite but will only nibble off a claw. Of course, at least not at the time of action. As for what we rely on, it is our own defense equipment. We can safely wait and see how Europe chooses. We firmly believe that if other countries are willing to organize true peace, guarantee collective security, and unite all peaceful forces to counter aggressive forces, it can only succeed with the Soviet Union's participation. Only the Soviet Union can build a barrier of peace in Europe. This is something that the aggressors themselves may also know deeply, and for this reason, they are doing their best to isolate Western Europe from the Soviet Union. But I must insist that the issue is not the isolation of the Soviet Union, but the isolation of other countries in Europe, making them defenseless against aggressors and forced to obey. The Soviet Union's diplomacy will be the same as before, still fighting for peace in the same way as before. The superiority of these methods has long been proven by daily lessons. As for myself, I will continue to perform my work in a Bolshevik manner, so that I can continue to live up to the honor conferred upon me today." (TASS, 10th)</p>

<p>Madrid: Several battalions of reinforcements from Catalonia province arrived today, and, under the cover of airplanes and artillery, launched an offensive against the rebel positions in the southern suburbs. They have driven back the rebels from the former Royal Botanical Garden, and the rebel salient has been pushed back to its base in the western suburbs. (National Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>Madrid: According to a public communiqué from the authorities here, government militia forces today launched a successful counter-offensive in the Casa de Campo area near the Royal Palace, forcing the enemy to retreat. Several airplanes participated in the battle to provide support. The militia forces continue to hold all bridgeheads across the Manzanares River. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>Madrid: A special dispatch from our correspondent states that the Nationalist air force, which belongs to the National Army in the outskirts of Madrid, was particularly active yesterday. It is estimated that within twenty minutes, sixteen airplanes successively dropped bombs on the government army positions, with extremely intense force. The government army positions stretched for approximately five kilometers, and bombs fell like rain everywhere, with smoke and dust pervading the area. The entire city of Madrid was almost obscured by the smoke. At the same time, the Nationalist artillery batteries launched intensive artillery fire against the government army positions at the "Toledo" bridge and the "Segovia" bridge outside the south gate. However, the government army held the entire line and did not retreat at all. At 1:30 PM, they used artillery to heavily bombard the Nationalist positions in the town of Carabanchel in the southern suburbs, inflicting heavy damage. By 2:00 PM, the government troops' positions in the Casa de Campo Park in the western suburbs had also greatly improved. In addition, a unit of reinforcements dispatched from the Autonomous Region of Catalonia arrived in the capital at 4:00 PM, carrying a large number of new-style weapons. The military appearance was very impressive, and therefore, the authorities were greatly pleased, and the morale of the people was boosted. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) According to a telegram from our special correspondent with the Spanish Nationalist army, a brigade of Moorish and foreign legion troops, commanded by Ambassador Gastón, has reportedly occupied the northern railway station in Madrid. This brigade reached its destination by crossing the King's Bridge from the Casa de Campo area near the Royal Palace. However, the main line of the Nationalist army is still limited to the west bank of the Manzanares River. Despite heavy artillery bombardment and air raids, the government militia forces continue to firmly defend all bridges and avenues leading to the bridges. The government forces' direct artillery batteries are very inactive, apparently due to a lack of ammunition. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>Madrid Front Line: The rebels have today advanced to the vicinity of the old military palace in the northwest of the capital. The main battle is still taking place on the banks of the Manzanares River in the south. The rebel shock troops have penetrated deep into various parts of the city and are engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the government forces. The rebels' strategy today is to follow the old tactic of taking Irún, avoiding a rapid offensive and instead gradually encircling the city to avoid heavy losses. The government army is making every effort to strengthen its defensive line, which is a total of eight miles long and defended by approximately 50,000 troops. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>Madrid: Government officials recently issued a declaration stating, "We are now planning to add more airplanes, so that the skies of Madrid will be completely covered by aircraft wings. The residents will soon be able to witness this scene." The National Defense Committee is currently focusing on defense work and has gained the trust of the people, so its orders are obeyed without resistance. A total of four orders were issued today: (1) Residents who have not joined the militia and possess weapons must hand them over to the police station. (2) Troops should patrol all streets to help maintain order and should intervene when residents are assaulted. (3) Residents in each building should form committees, dispatch responsible personnel to search for concealed weapons in the buildings, and take turns guarding in front of the buildings. (4) Residents in each district should practice street fighting and dig trenches. In addition, the committee also distributed leaflets to instill various technical knowledge in the public, such as advising the public to prepare empty bottles, store them with kerosene, and when Nationalist tanks arrive, ignite the kerosene and throw it at them. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>Seville: General Driaño, Commander-in-Chief of the Nationalist army in the south, recently issued a broadcast message stating, "The failure to capture Madrid quickly has caused people around the world to become impatient, but this undertaking cannot be achieved overnight. In the past, the enemy's forces spread throughout the country, but now they are confined to a precarious city, still thinking of putting up a stubborn resistance. By comparing the past with the present, the outcome is clear. In order to avoid setbacks, our army has to take some preventive measures, such as consolidating the recovered areas, which is one aspect. The advance of modern armies is also a complex undertaking. Our army does not want to advance lightly for this reason. As far as yesterday's battle situation is concerned, our army's right wing on the Madrid front advanced one kilometer. The government army attacked our army's left wing but was repelled and suffered heavy losses." (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>Defending the Precarious City, Vowing Not to Surrender</p>
<p>Barcelona: The radio station belonging to the local Socialist Party recently issued a broadcast message at 8:30 PM stating, "The city of Madrid will never surrender to the rebels, because that city is the capital and its position is important, unlike other cities. The authorities understand this, and they will not rashly abandon it. Given time, the government army will surely win. As for the Nationalist army, it does not have the strength to support its attacks, which are merely a show of force. Therefore, its collapse is imminent." It also stated that, according to foreign legionnaires who surrendered to the government army, several foreign legion soldiers recently arrested and killed two female nurses, then put their corpses in baskets and burned them. This kind of atrocity is truly outrageous. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>Rebel Strategy: Avoiding Strength and Attacking Weakness</p>
<p>Talavera de la Reina (100 kilometers southwest of Madrid): A special dispatch from our correspondent states that the news released by the high-ranking military officials of the Nationalist army to the news reporters regarding the war situation in the outskirts of Madrid is extremely scarce. According to the general impression, in the past two days, the strategy adopted by the Nationalist army has been to find the weakest point in the enemy's defense line in order to avoid strength and attack weakness. Therefore, they sometimes attack and sometimes counter-attack, but have not achieved any substantial results. It has recently been reported that the government army launched an attack on the right wing of the Nationalist army near the village of Villaverde yesterday (southeast of Madrid, no more than six or seven kilometers from the city), but it failed and retreated in disarray. At the same time, the left wing of the Nationalist army made slight progress near the "Florida" bridge east of Casa de Campo Park in the western suburbs of Madrid. Apart from these two points, the front lines are still relatively calm. The Nationalist army is only carrying out mopping-up operations in the villages near Madrid that it occupied a few days ago, capturing many government officers and soldiers. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>Airplanes and Heavy Artillery Launch Fierce Bombardment</p>
<p>Madrid: Several airplanes belonging to the Nationalist army came to the city again at 3:00 PM today and dropped bombs. Airplanes belonging to the government army immediately took off to intercept them, and they finally drove away the enemy airplanes. At 5:00 PM, the heavy artillery batteries belonging to the Nationalist army began to bombard the city. Several shells often landed in the city, and the sound of explosions reverberated far and wide, causing people to tremble. One shell landed inside the Congress of Deputies, exploding in the press gallery. Fortunately, there was no one in the room at that time, and there were no casualties. The Havas News Agency's Spanish branch is only 50 meters away from the Congress of Deputies, separated only by a small square, so it was also greatly startled. It is said that the Nationalist army's use of heavy artillery seems to be aimed at disrupting the morale of government officials in the city of Madrid, so its shelling is mostly aimed at public institutions. Unfortunately, its aiming is not accurate and it failed to hit the targets, but it destroyed civilian residences, harming innocent people, resulting in many deaths and injuries. On the west side of the capital, the government army advanced along the Extremadura highway. The National Defense Committee subsequently announced at 6:00 PM in the evening, "The government army has surrounded the Nationalist army in Casa de Campo Park in the western suburbs and captured many people, including a Moroccan chieftain. According to his confession, the Nationalist army has a total of 10,000 officers and soldiers responsible for attacking the city of Madrid." (Havas, 10th)</p>

<p>(Vienna) The foreign ministers' conference of Italy, Austria, and Hungary is scheduled to hold its first decisive meeting at 3:30 PM today, adjourning at 5:00 PM. Today marks the birthday of King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy. Austrian government representatives, along with personnel from the Italian and Hungarian delegations, attended a celebratory Mass at an Italian church this morning. Afterward, they jointly attended a luncheon hosted by Austrian President Miklas. The government will also host a grand banquet at the Hungarian Palais tonight, inviting members of the Italian and Hungarian delegations. It is expected that 1,500 guests will be invited to the banquet. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Regarding the issue of the Italy-Austria-Hungary foreign ministers' conference, the semi-official "Popolo di Roma" newspaper's Vienna correspondent, Signor Senureti, recently stated, "The three foreign ministers' conference should recognize Italy's annexation of Abyssinia in law." The three foreign ministers will also reach a compromise on the following three main issues: (1) the attitude to be adopted regarding the collective security system; (2) the issue of preventing Bolshevism and dealing with the situation in Spain; and (3) the issue of economic cooperation. Regarding the first issue, the three foreign ministers' conference should state that although Article 19 of the League of Nations Covenant stipulates that "The Assembly may from time to time advise the reconsideration by Members of the League of treaties which have become inapplicable," the League of Nations has consistently failed to amend the various peace treaties after the European War for the past fifteen years. Therefore, any collective security system based on the League of Nations will inevitably lack power. However, Austria cannot explicitly oppose the principle of collective security for the time being and will continue to maintain its current attitude, which should also be recognized by the three foreign ministers' conference. Regarding the second issue, the three foreign ministers' conference should state that the three countries have completely identical interests in resisting communism and dealing with the Spanish Civil War, so they should take joint action. As for the third issue of economic cooperation, any of the three countries has the right to develop economic relations with other countries. This right, including Austria's planned trade agreement with Germany, should be recognized by the three foreign ministers' conference. In addition, the three foreign ministers' conference should reaffirm the following proposition: all countries that aspire to peace must unite around the Rome Protocols of Italy, Austria, and Hungary, as well as the agreements between Germany and Italy. As for the issue of treaty revision, the three foreign ministers' conference should state that treaty revision cannot be expected to be realized until the international atmosphere is cleared. To clear the international atmosphere, the influence of the Soviet Union on certain countries, such as Czechoslovakia, must be eliminated. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the Italy-Austria-Hungary foreign ministers' conference, "Le Journal" recently reported that, according to responsible sources, Italy may request the League of Nations to amend the Treaty of Trianon (i.e., the peace treaty with Hungary after the European War) in accordance with Article 19 of the League of Nations Covenant, which stipulates that "The Assembly may from time to time advise the reconsideration by Members of the League of treaties which have become inapplicable." "Le Petit Journal" reported that the rumors that the Austrian Habsburg dynasty is about to be restored are mostly Italian air, used to test the opinions of various countries. According to the Rome correspondent of "Le Figaro", Italy should recognize Hungary's rearmament and some of its demands for the return of territory as legitimate and legal. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano, who is on an official visit to Austria, solemnly assured Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg today that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is determined to protect Austrian independence. Austrian patriots were quite surprised by Ciano's recent discussions in Berlin and Mussolini's cold attitude towards Austria in his speech in Milan. Now that they have received this assurance from Ciano, they can rest assured. Ciano further hinted that Mussolini has sympathetically considered the restoration of Archduke Otto of the Habsburg dynasty, but does not intend to take active steps on this matter before the major Mediterranean issues are resolved.

<p>Capital of Yugoslavia. As the Italy-Austria-Hungary foreign ministers' conference is about to open, the Little Entente countries fear that Hungary may raise the issue of revising the Treaty of Trianon. It is reported that they have decided that if any action violates this treaty, the Little Entente countries will immediately consult on retaliatory measures through diplomatic channels. These measures will be limited to financial means. (Havas, 10th) Budapest.

<h3 id="e61">Britain Guarantees Security, Actively Expanding Military, Navy Still the First Line of Defense, Air Force Striving to Surpass Other Countries <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>(London) Sir Inskip, Minister for Coordination of Defence, stated in the House of Commons this afternoon, when discussing the British national defense issue, that the navy is still the first line of defense, and that the army and air force should urgently cooperate. The main purpose of expanding the British air force is to defend Britain from the danger of air raids and to develop a strong air force to resist foreign enemies. This is the goal and aspiration of the British people. In terms of speed, capacity, and flight range, British aircraft are not inferior to other countries. Britain's national defense, in addition to the air force, is also perfected by other means, such as artillery, searchlights, and other technical equipment. Inskip also stated that the increase in British aircraft production has just begun and will continue to increase next year until 1940. The government aircraft factory in Nottingham will start shipping within six weeks. Powerful artillery is the most important thing in air defense. Inskip continued that army recruitment is progressing slowly, while navy and air force recruitment is doing well. There are 60,000 applicants for 20,000 places, and the number of pilots has increased by 50%. If Britain takes appropriate measures, he does not believe that war cannot be avoided. However, once Britain joins the war, it will never be able to stop until it obtains security. This means that Britain must make the greatest effort to seek complete victory. The British government has decided not to appoint a Minister of Supply. Unless there is strong evidence to prove that this appointment is necessary, the British government will study this matter periodically. The rearmament program has greatly strained the national finances. If the government intervenes in industries during peacetime, there is a danger of disrupting the national financial structure. He believes that the House of Commons will be very wise and have a broad vision to meet the needs of the country without stopping the export trade on which the country's financial position depends. Sir Hoare, the First Lord of the Admiralty, concluded the national defense debate, recalling that speakers in the House of Commons have never inquired about the seriousness of the situation or the need for rearmament, and said that any international disarmament discussions cannot start from the current situation, but must be discussed based on the appropriate level of security for the British Empire. Hoare denied the claim that the British air force program is lagging behind other countries and expressed satisfaction with the current state of the British air force, resolutely stating that as for the so-called "shadow industry," that is, several manufacturers each undertaking to build a component of an aircraft, when factories were first started to do this in a fair way, it was intended to continue issuing manufacturing tools so that in the event of an emergency, they could carry out all the procedures in one place. Although progress has been gradually made in national defense affairs, there is still much work to be done, such as some issues regarding supply that need to be studied. Hoare concluded by saying that we are deeply aware of the seriousness of the world situation and feel that it is urgent to speed up everything. (Reuters, 10th)</p>

(3) Regarding the Eastern European Pact issue, Colonel Beck did not explain Poland's attitude. British sources believe that Poland's desire to maintain neutrality between Germany and Russia and to be a major power in Eastern Europe is contradictory. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck recently gave a speech to the newspapers, referring to the future Locarno Treaty, briefly stating that he hopes that this treaty can be established, but on the condition that Poland's legitimate interests are not harmed.

<p>Geneva Correspondence. The annual general assembly of the League of Nations (the 17th) began on September 21st and adjourned on October 11th this year. This major assembly had several issues worth reporting, and it can be said to be a relatively successful one in recent years under the tense world situation. First, such as the question of the qualifications of the Abyssinian representative, viewers felt that it was a difficult obstacle for the League of Nations a few days before the League of Nations Assembly. No matter what method the Assembly took to refuse the participation of the Abyssinian country in the Assembly, it could not maintain the world's public's final belief in it in terms of law and morality. Although there were several reasons for the vote of the Abyssinian country to participate in the Assembly this time, it cannot be said that it was not a victory between public opinion and the threat of power. From this point of view, the belief of the world's people in the League of Nations can still be preserved for a while. Second, the Administrative Council has returned to normal. From the general purpose of the League of Nations, the Administrative Council has shown an unbalanced state since Japan withdrew from the League and China failed to be elected. The Administrative Council only has European and American representatives, but lacks Asia, which not only violates the spirit of the Covenant, but also is an important obstacle to international cooperation. This regret has now been made up. Third, the disarmament conference, which the world's people eagerly anticipated, has been in decline for several years, and now there is hope of revival. In addition, regarding the reorganization of the League of Nations Covenant, although the future result is still difficult to guess, judging from the opinions of more than 30 countries that have already responded, the majority advocate strengthening the power of the Covenant, tending towards practicality. If the world's people do not give up their supervisory power, world peace may not be hopeless. As one of the members, China has a mission of peace in the world no less than any other country in terms of population and region. China's participation in the work of the League of Nations is not only for its own sake, but also for world peace. We not only hope for international understanding, but also hope that our own people will understand. The reporter hereby reports the process of this conference, fearing that the length is too long, and because of time constraints, the description inevitably focuses on our country, but issues such as the reorganization of the League of Nations and disarmament are described in summary for the reference of those who study international issues.</p>
<h3 id="e69">An Abyssinian Delegate <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The Twists and Turns of Qualification: Before discussing this issue, a related question must be revisited. This concerns the League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol's trip to Rome. This decisive trip provoked much criticism from public opinion. Some said Avenol's visit to Rome was less about urging and more about apologizing. Regardless, we don't need to concern ourselves with that. However, at a minimum, an informal opinion seemed to have formed regarding the issue of Abyssinian delegates attending the General Assembly. If we haven't misinterpreted this opinion, then the reason why the Italian delegation later waited on the border before departing for Geneva doesn't need explanation. This is a question that many still have. Perhaps only Avenol can answer it. Under this question, many twists and turns arose, resulting in the first ever difficulty in forming a Credentials Committee in the history of the League of Nations. Small countries, wanting to please everyone, couldn't bear this significant responsibility. Large countries like Britain and France, while having their fixed foreign policies, hoped to use this decisive opportunity to bring Italy back to Geneva, to facilitate the Locarno issue. However, legally, they couldn't find a sufficient reason to revoke Abyssinia's membership in the League of Nations. They were also unwilling to openly shoulder the responsibility under the public scrutiny of the world. Therefore, under these circumstances, the Credentials Committee couldn't be formed, and a voting method had to be used to resolve the issue. As a result of the voting, representatives from Britain (Eden), France (Foreign Minister Delbos), the Soviet Union (Litvinov), Czechoslovakia (Osuský), Greece (Politis), Turkey (Aras), Peru (Dudela), New Zealand (Jordan), and the Netherlands (Limburg) were elected. Thus, the Credentials Committee was finally established. Our country wasn't elected, and some in our delegation were quite gleeful. However, if the same event occurred in our Executive Yuan after our election, what attitude would our country adopt?</p>
<p>The committee could only complete its report on the third day after the General Assembly convened. Several meetings were held in between, and it was almost impossible to find a concrete solution. Consequently, the committee created a subcommittee to specifically study Abyssinia's current situation and the legal qualifications of its leader, and then report back to the committee for discussion. Fortunately, there were two relatively courageous representatives on the committee, one was the Dutch representative Limburg, and the other was the Soviet representative Litvinov. Limburg suggested seeking the opinion of the Hague Court, which, although a way of shirking responsibility, was much more superior than a policy of trying to please everyone. After the committee discussed this proposal, two concerns were discovered. First, there was a fear that after the court studied the issue, it would consider it not a purely legal question, but an international political issue, and decline the responsibility of advising. Second, due to time constraints, the court's response couldn't be obtained in the short term, and at least several weeks would be needed. Distant water couldn't quench the immediate thirst. The General Assembly couldn't wait for the court's response before proceeding with its work. Finally, Litvinov said very emotionally that if anyone opposed Abyssinia's participation in the General Assembly, please formally state the reasons. If there wasn't a committee, why delay any further? As a result, everyone looked at each other, but no one dared to openly object. The qualifications of the Abyssinian representative could then be approved. Although it was unfortunate for Eden and Delbos, it couldn't be said to be unfortunate for the League of Nations. Many British and French newspapers said that Litvinov had achieved a great victory. The British Conservative Party's official newspaper condemned Eden, saying that he hadn't implemented his foreign policy. Even the Labour Party's newspaper said that Eden had reached the point of resigning, and asked why he hadn't resigned yet. It can be seen that this twist was not a temporary occurrence, but merely a temporary change. The reasons in the report were as follows: "Upon examination of the credentials, it was found that they were from the same authority that had previously dispatched delegation to attend the General Assembly several times. However, when the credentials were issued on the fourteenth and nineteenth of September (this year), Abyssinia's situation had undergone great changes in all aspects. The head of state was residing in a foreign government and was no longer in the capital. According to various documents, another government authority was to be established in another part of the country. It seems particularly difficult to judge the authority of that authority and the nature and scope of its power in relation to its head of state. The question itself lies in whether the mandate required by the head of state's legal title is entirely in accordance with the procedure. The Committee feels the seriousness of this issue, so no one has proposed taking a rejection approach, declaring the mandate unreasonable. On the contrary, no one is without doubt as to whether the procedure is followed. Under these circumstances, one might think of asking the General Assembly for the advice of the International Court, whether the credentials issued in the current position of His Majesty Haile Selassie meet the requirements of Article 5, Section 2 of the General Assembly's constitution, so that the bearer of the item is in accordance with Article 3, Section 1 of the covenant, as a representative of a member state of the League of Nations, but at the same time, another problem arises. If the court begins to discuss the above points, it is unlikely that an answer can be obtained within a few weeks. In that special period, the current General Assembly will inevitably be closed. At the same time, what status will the Abyssinian delegation be in? According to Article 5, Section 4 of the General Assembly's Constitution, "For any representative who has a disagreement, if the General Assembly has no other resolution, he may temporarily participate in the General Assembly and enjoy the same rights as other representatives." From the observation of this article, the question of whether the Abyssinian delegation can participate in the current General Assembly should be practically decided before the court's reply. The reason is very obvious. If the meaning of the last section is followed, the answer from The Hague will be of no practical value. Therefore, the best way is to ask the General Assembly to consider the Abyssinian delegation's credentials, regardless of whether they are reasonable or not, to be sufficient reason to allow its delegation to participate in the current General Assembly. This is the unanimous view of the Committee, and has been carefully considered when passing it, and it is believed that only by giving the delegation special assistance in the midst of doubts, and in terms of the current situation in Abyssinia, the measure is limited to the current General Assembly and does not involve any future opinions. Based on the above opinions and the implementation of its full responsibilities, the Committee respectfully requests the General Assembly to allow the Abyssinian delegation to participate in the work of the current General Assembly." After the report was read in the General Assembly, the Hungarian representative requested a vote, and the representatives from Austria and Albania seconded. The General Assembly then voted, with thirty-nine countries voting in favor of the report, including the South African Federation, Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Britain, Canada, China, Colombia, Cuba, Denmark, the Dominican Republic, Spain, Estonia, Abyssinia, Finland, France, Greece, Haiti, India, Iraq, Iran, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Mexico, Norway, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Peru, Poland, Romania, Sweden, Czechoslovakia, Turkey, the Soviet Union, Uruguay, and Yugoslavia. Four countries voted against, including Albania, Austria, Hungary, and Ecuador. Six countries abstained, including Bulgaria, Panama, Portugal, Siam, Switzerland, and Venezuela. The report was then passed. Abyssinia was able to participate in the current General Assembly, and the appearance of this twist, as stated in the committee's report, was due to the king's departure and the government not being in the capital, which was equivalent to losing the qualifications of a member state. However, no explanation was given as to why the king left and why the government wasn't in the capital. The invaded party lost all rights, which can serve as a lesson. The day before the report was completed, the chairman of the International Wireless Radio Peace Propaganda Conference, which was being held at the same time as the League of Nations, announced his withdrawal from the conference on the orders of his government, to express a threat to the League of Nations. The Italian delegation waiting for news on the border had no choice but to drive back to Rome. The black-shirted prime minister's heart was naturally very uncomfortable. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e70">Shao Yuan Chong’s Impressions of Guangxi: The People's Organizations Are Sound, Women Are Hardworking and Bear Heavy Burdens, The Army Is Organized Into Seven Divisions, and the Militia Has Mostly Resumed Training, The Central and Local Authorities Jointly Reorganize the Currency System <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Shao Yuan Chong, a member of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang, went to Guangdong earlier this month to attend Chairman Hu's state funeral and toured Guangxi. He has now completed his tasks and traveled north from Guangzhou through Guangxi by car. On the morning of the 9th, he took a car from Hengyang to Changsha. That evening, around 8 o'clock, he took a train to Hankou, arriving at Xujiapeng Station at 8 a.m. on the 10th. He crossed the river and stayed at the Pacific Hotel. In the evening, he attended a joint banquet hosted by the Pacification Headquarters and the two party branches of the province and city. He was scheduled to pay respects to Yang Yongtai on the 11th and give speeches at the Provincial Party Headquarters and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. He left Hankou by steamer that night to return to Nanjing. Shao shared his impressions of his Guangxi tour, saying that although his visit to Guangxi lasted only eight days, what he saw in various aspects was very pleasant and what impressed him the most was the soundness of the people's organizations and the hardworking and burden-bearing nature of women. The people's organization in the province is headed by the village chief, who also serves as the principal of the people's school and the head of the militia. With the power concentrated, it is easier to handle affairs. Most of the village chiefs have received considerable training and can handle affairs with a spirit of hard work. Currently, the number of militias in the province is around one million. In general, women can bear heavy burdens and are not only responsible for most of the agricultural work, but also for hard work such as carrying water and sedan chairs. The Guangxi reconstruction work has now been completed two-thirds. Initially, more than 300,000 militiamen were mobilized, and now more than 200,000 have been demobilized. Because the people's organizations are sound, mobilization is easy and demobilization is not difficult. The Guangxi army is currently organized into six divisions, and the 19th Route Army was recently organized into one division, for a total of seven divisions. Mr. Bai Jiansheng is currently working hard on the demobilization of the army, and his departure date to the north has not yet been determined, but it will be after the demobilization work is completed. In short, Guangxi is now working hard from top to bottom. Although the financial situation is not very affluent, the authorities are dealing with it effectively, so several important tasks in recent years have a good foundation. Looking back at Guangdong Province, although the financial situation has been more affluent than Guangxi in the past few years, all important tasks, such as people's organizations, are far less developed than in Guangxi. From this, it can be seen that things depend on people. As long as you can work hard, you will have satisfactory results. At present, Guangxi's currency is still mainly circulated in the form of Guangxi Bank banknotes. Its exchange rate to the central government's banknotes is only about 50 cents per yuan, so the work of reorganizing the currency system is extremely important. The Guangxi Provincial Government and the central government are currently working hard on this task. Shao also said that Guangdong Province is currently engaged in production construction and financial reorganization. After the completion of the Yuehan Railway, the north and south are connected, and Guangdong's prosperity will be even more advanced. However, after the opening of the railway, unfortunate incidents have occurred one after another, and the road infrastructure seems to be not yet perfect and the speed is very slow. The cleanliness of the vehicles needs to be improved and should be rectified as soon as possible."</p>

<p>Shi, wife of Sun Dexian of Wengjiao, Xinzhuang, suffered from mental illness. She hanged herself on August 14th of this year. After the coffin was prepared, someone, using a false name, filed lawsuits with courts at all levels, alleging that Shi was beaten by her husband and forced to commit suicide. The District Court and the High Court both dismissed the case. Another lawsuit was filed with the Supreme Court under the name Wang Liusheng. The court ordered the Songjiang Court to steam the bones in the coffin and conduct an examination. The High Court sent inspectors Xuan Fang and Yang Haiyang to Songjiang. On the afternoon of the 10th, the coffin was placed in the public forest clearing north of the North Gate. Chief Prosecutor Zhu presided over the examination, removed the bottom of the coffin, took out the body, removed the burial clothes, and according to the law, dissected the bones and tagged and sealed them one by one. Starting at 8 a.m. on the 11th, the bones were washed clean one by one and steamed. The examination revealed that she had hanged herself before death.

<h3 id="e77">County Chamber of Commerce General Meeting <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce convened its annual general meeting of members yesterday afternoon. 149 representatives attended, and the county government and county party branch sent personnel to attend for supervision and guidance. The following key cases were resolved: (1) The Foreign Goods Industry Association requested a reduction in business tax, still collected at 8 per thousand. (2) The Gold and Silver Industry Association proposed that the business tax be changed to 15 per thousand, requesting that it still be collected at the original 10 per thousand. The above two cases were discussed together and resolved that the chamber would submit them separately to the Finance Department for review and reduction. (3) It was proposed that the bank's small coins and auxiliary currency cannot be exchanged at any time, and that there are no exchange offices, requesting a discussion of relief measures. Resolved that those with exchange offices should be transferred to the Banking Association to request immediate exchange. Those without exchange offices will be reported to the department for instructions. (4) It was proposed that there is a special type of business that specializes in trading empty sales at the stock exchange as an improper business, and the authorities should strictly ban it. In addition, each industry often has price reductions and competitive sales, deliberately causing trouble, requesting the formulation of disposal methods. Resolved that special stores with illegitimate businesses should be strictly prohibited by the authorities. Price reductions and competitive sales in various industries involve industry rules, and each trade association should formulate its own methods and report them to the association for handling. (5) The brewing and other 14 industry associations stated that the association's expenses should be collected in accordance with Article 41 of the Commercial Association's regulations, based on the amount of capital of each industry, in order to equalize the burden. Resolved that each industry association should first investigate the capital of its members, and then the matter should be resolved by a temporary general meeting of members.</p>

<p>The Jiangdu County Government believes that the county's telephone service has not yet reached all towns, and it is difficult to order the township chiefs in each district in case of emergency, and the public security bureaus stationed in each township also lack a method of rapid delivery of orders in case of emergency.

<p>The Fifth District Office of Muyang County reported that the district suffered a terrible yellow flood last year, and between July and August this year, due to the low-lying terrain, continuous rain caused a disaster, so that Datong, Qiaoliheng, Huangjiadang, Pangoudang and other villages had empty houses, and families were destitute. Winter is approaching, and they are suffering from hunger and cold. If relief is not provided immediately, they may become bandits or die in the gutters. The district chief Jiang Dounan, seeing this, telegraphed the county government and the county party branch yesterday, requesting them to report the situation to the province and various charitable organizations to allocate funds for relief to save them. It is said that the county government has reported this separately.</p>

<p>The Fenghua Salt Field Official Property Office, since receiving the provincial order to abolish it, transferred it to the county government for filing and continued handling. Because there are still quite a few barren and mature salt fields along the rivers and coast, and although the official properties in the city and countryside have been disposed of one after another, some are still in use, or are still occupied by the people, which should be investigated and disposed of according to regulations in order to determine property rights and increase income. Yesterday, a notice was issued stating that if anyone occupies salt fields or official properties, they must come to the county to report and receive them in order to survey and evaluate the price. Those who dare to delay will be auctioned off in accordance with the regulations.</p>

<p>Xu Li, a widow from Litonggang, Cizhong, is 36 years old and has only one nine-year-old son. Mother and son depend on each other for survival. At 6 a.m. on the 8th, two bandits suddenly broke into her home. Shi was cooking in the kitchen upstairs. After the two bandits went upstairs, they were about to open the box and search when Shi heard the sound and went upstairs. The bandits saw that there were no men in her house and immediately pressed her to the ground. One of them reached out and took off her lower clothes, intending to rape her. Seeing that the situation was not good, Shi shouted for help. The bandit, seeing that the good deed was difficult to accomplish, held a grudge and stabbed her head, face, arms and other parts with a sharp blade. At this time, neighbors had heard the call and rushed to gather, and arrested a bandit named Zhu Xiaozhong, and sent him to the Hongtang Public Security Bureau for further investigation. However, Shi was severely injured and may be in danger of death. The bandit named Agou has not yet been apprehended. The county government has ordered the investigation to be carried out.</p>

<p>Special Edition for the 6th Anniversary of the Ant Society</p>
<h3 id="e85">Our Beliefs (In Lieu of a Launching Statement) <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The Ant Society has been established for six years now. Examining the achievements of our work over the past six years, what we have contributed to society and culture is truly very meager, and we cannot help but feel deeply ashamed. However, we are determined not to be discouraged. We believe that as long as we have a true understanding of culture and strive along the right path, our efforts will never be in vain, and we will gain some harvest.</p>
<p>We are not cultural supremacists. We oppose blaming all irrationality on culture, or using culture to solve everything. However, we will never deny the power of culture, and thus ignore its feedback effect on society. This is the reason why we are engaged in cultural movements.</p>
<p>We believe that culture, like everything else in the universe, is constantly flowing. Therefore, each era has its own culture. The culture of the past can no longer meet the needs of the present. Modern culture must be compatible with the needs of the present. This is our understanding of culture when we engage in cultural movements.</p>
<p>We oppose culture being monopolized by a small number of people and used as a tool to oppress the majority. We firmly advocate that culture should belong to the masses, it should be the spiritual food of the masses, and it should be used to improve the lives of the masses. Therefore, the masses are the target of our cultural movement.</p>
<p>Because the masses are the target of our cultural movement, we recognize that engaging in cultural movements must go deep into the masses, understand the needs of the masses, and use them as the guidelines for our cultural movement. This is the attitude we take towards cultural movements.</p>
<p>We believe that in the process of cultural development, the conflict between new and old cultures is an inevitable phenomenon. We must strive for the new culture, we must be unyielding, consistent from beginning to end, in order to fulfill our hopes. This is the spirit we should have towards cultural movements.</p>
<p>The above are the common beliefs of all members of the Ant Society. In the past, we worked hard under this common belief. It is still the case now. What about the future? We must adhere to this belief. The Ant Society is not only the Ant Society of the members of the Ant Society. The Ant Society should belong to the whole society. We deeply hope that people who are enthusiastic about cultural movements will give us valuable assistance.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Lyrics of the Ant Society Song <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Ants are small insects that love group cooperation and mutual assistance,</p>
<p>Ants are a mass with a group organization,</p>
<p>We are all ants,</p>
<p>Not stupid worms that eat books and are useless,</p>
<p>In this trench where light and darkness duel,</p>
<p>We must rush forward,</p>
<p>Forward, forward, forward, forward, forward,</p>
<p>We must all rush forward,</p>
<p>With the spirit of ants,</p>
<p>To sow the seeds of new culture,</p>
<p>To make the light of the new world more brilliant and bright red,</p>
<p>Arise, arise, ants,</p>
<p>Everyone arise, ants,</p>
<p>Go forward to be the pioneers of freedom and equality, freedom and equality.</p>
<h3 id="e87">The Ant Society and the Current Stage of Cultural Movement <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Zhuo</p>
<p>The current stage of the cultural movement is, of course, inherited from the previous stage. However, because of the continuous invasion of the enemy and the increasing national crisis, it must inevitably shoulder new tasks. What are these new tasks? It is to quickly establish a national defense culture. In other words: the current stage of the cultural movement should be the national defense cultural movement.</p>
<p>The national defense cultural movement, like the military, political, and economic national defense movements, is to gather the entire strength to resist the enemy's general attack, so that the national crisis can be saved and the final victory can be achieved.</p>
<p>This places an even greater responsibility on all cultural movement groups and individuals to promote it.</p>
<p>The Ant Society is a group that has always worked hard in cultural movements. In every period, it has shown great strength. This can be seen from its various departments. The continuous expansion of the Ant Library, the frequent performances of meaningful dramas by the Ant Drama Troupe, the expansion of the Ant Supplementary Night School, the change of the reading club to an academic research association, the holding of various friendships by the friendship association, and other various advances have not only made the number of members increase sharply every year, but also expanded the cultural impact day by day. On the one hand, this is due to the efforts of the members in the work of the various departments, but on the other hand, it cannot be said that it has grasped the tasks of each period.</p>
<p>Now that new tasks are in front of us, we must not only embrace the consistent spirit, but also redouble our efforts to join hands with all cultural movement groups, and hope that people who are enthusiastic about cultural movements will participate with us. Let us all move towards the current stage of cultural movement!</p>

<p>Yesterday was the 18th anniversary of Polish independence. The Polish Embassy in China and the Consulate General in Shanghai, as well as Polish companies and firms, were all closed and flags were hung to celebrate. However, there was no official reception. Only the Polish Minister to China, Wei Dentao, led overseas Chinese in prayer and joint celebration by officials and civilians.</p>
<p>Poland was an independent country until the end of the 18th century. Due to internal wars and external troubles, the country was divided and became a vassal of other countries. At the beginning of the European War, Poland was also caught in the vortex. In 1915, the entire territory was occupied by the Austrian-German army. On November 9, 1918, it declared independence. Two days later, General Pi Sutzuki was released from Magdeborg Prison and returned to Poland, taking full control of the country and convening the National Assembly. On June 28, 1919, its independence was recognized by the Treaty of Versailles. In 1929, China and Poland signed a treaty of friendship. Since then, the diplomatic relations between the two countries have become increasingly close, especially in cultural cooperation.</p>

<h3 id="e99">Li Sihao Talks About His Meeting with President Jiang Reported and Asked for Instructions on Negotiations in Principle Met with Foreign Minister Zhang and Others in More Concrete Talks - Scheduled to Leave Shanghai and Fly Back to Ping on the 16th - <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Li Sihao, Chairman of the Economic Committee of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, went to Hangzhou from Shanghai on the 6th and flew to Luoyang to meet with President Jiang. He returned south to Beijing on the 8th and visited Director-General Zhang and Director-General Wu and other authorities. He left Beijing by car at 5:00 PM the day before yesterday and returned to Shanghai. He arrived in port at 10:50 PM last night. Yesterday morning at 9:00, he went to the Duan residence on Avenue Joffre to assist in the funeral arrangements. A reporter from the New Sound Society paid a special visit. According to his account, he left Shanghai for Hangzhou on the 6th, originally intending to return to his ancestral home in Cixi to handle the funeral of his uncle. However, he received a telegram from President Jiang summoning him urgently, so he flew to see him to report and ask for instructions on everything. However, the discussion was only on general principles. President Jiang highly praised the painstaking efforts of Commissioner Song (Zheyuan). Regarding economic cooperation, he said that under the principles of "not losing sovereignty" and "not containing aggression", it could be carried out at an appropriate time, and he frequently inquired about the passing of Mr. Duan and expressed his condolences. He stayed in Luoyang for one day and one night and returned south to Beijing on the 8th. He successively visited Secretary-General Weng, Foreign Minister Zhang, Director-General Wu, Director-General Zhang Tie, and others. He originally intended to return to Shanghai the night before last, but he postponed it to wait for a meeting with Director-General Zhang Tie. After Zhang flew from Shanghai to Beijing yesterday to meet with him, he returned to Shanghai last night. He said that he had met with various responsible officials in Beijing and had relatively concrete discussions on economic cooperation in North China. He had discussed the methods, but the content was not convenient to disclose. He is now scheduled to take a plane north to return to Ping on the 16th. However, because he has been away from Ping for a long time and official duties are urgently awaiting handling, he may need to leave one or two days earlier. His family originally planned to go as well, but his wife is currently ill and it has been postponed. He will return south again at the beginning of next month to assist in Mr. Duan's opening of the memorial service and moving the spirit.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Wang Yitang Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Morning, Talks Freely About the North China Problem, Says Danger Can Occur at Any Time, Advocates National Unity on Foreign Policy, Came Specifically to Offer Condolences to Duan, Will Return North Immediately <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Wang Yitang, a member of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Council, arrived in Shanghai at 7:40 AM yesterday morning, having traveled south on the Tianjin-Shanghai through train on the evening of the 9th to offer condolences for the death of Duan Qirui. After disembarking at the North Station, he first went to the Cangzhou Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road to rest. He then went to the Duan residence on Avenue Joffre around 10:30 AM to offer condolences. Given the current situation in North China, Wang is indeed a figure worthy of close attention. A reporter from the New Sound News Agency made a special visit to the Duan residence and was granted an audience, during which they spoke freely about everything. The following is a record of their conversation:</p>
<p>Here Solely to Offer Condolences to Duan</p>
<p>Wang began by saying, "It has been a year and a half since I last came to Shanghai. As I am getting old, I have been整理 my old works and have been frequently ill. If it were not for Mr. Duan's funeral, I would not have wanted to come to Shanghai. I will stay briefly and then return north. I will come again when the date for Mr. Duan's funeral is set."</p>
<p>The Situation in North China</p>
<p>Regarding the situation in North China, "Before I resigned from the Standing Committee of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Council, I had a relatively detailed understanding. Since resigning from the Standing Committee this spring, I only hold the title of member and do not ask about much, so I do not know much. However, the danger in North China has always been imminent. At present, the situation in Suiyuan is relatively tense, while there is nothing happening in Chahar. It is estimated that the rebellious bandits who invaded Suiyuan include the troops of Li Shouxin, Wang Ying, and others. Now, the focus of the northern situation has almost shifted to Suiyuan. Since negotiations are currently underway at the central level, it is not appropriate for unexpected events to occur."</p>
<p>Difficult to Predict</p>
<p>At this point, the reporter asked about his observation of the future of the situation. He replied, "This is difficult to predict. It depends on how the future changes, the results of the central negotiations, and the evolution of the local situation. Everything is interconnected."</p>
<p>Foreign Policy Stance</p>
<p>Wang continued, "Regarding North China's foreign policy, I had negotiations before Huang Yingbai went north three years ago. I also visited Chairman Chiang in Lushan two years ago, and my trip to Japan last year was not without its purpose. Since resigning from the Standing Committee, I have had little contact with the Japanese side. My foreign policy opinion is that, regardless of whether it is tough or flexible, friendly or resistant, successful or unsuccessful, the only requirement is that 'the entire country must be united; if the entire [country] is not united, it is a weakness.' Now, all parties in our country have realized this. For example, Mr. Duan's resolute move south earlier was to demonstrate the spirit of united action. I do not know anything about the details of the recent Sino-Japanese diplomatic negotiations, so it is difficult for me to express my opinion."</p>
<p>Economic Cooperation</p>
<p>As for Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, "I discussed it with Foreign Minister Zhang this spring when I met him in Qingdao. I believe that if it is based on the principle of 'equality and mutual benefit,' not only Japan but any country can talk about cooperation. However, if it contains the meaning of aggression, then it should be discussed separately."</p>
<p>Huie Bank Issue</p>
<p>Finally, the reporter asked about the revival of the Zhonghua Huie Bank. Wang said, "I am one of the shareholders of the bank. Since being elected as the general manager in the 23rd year [of the Republic], I have never had any contact. According to the bank's creditor-debtor relationship, the credits include 15 million owed by the government, and the debts are 4 million in deposits and over 800,000 in banknotes. The bank's organization has an equal number of Chinese and Japanese directors and supervisors. In addition to myself as the general manager, the deputy general manager is Japanese. The Chinese directors are Li Sihao, Cao Rulin, and Zeng Yunpei, and the supervisors are Duan Honggang and Zeng Rongfu. At present, both Chinese and Japanese shareholders are unwilling to resume [operations], so there is no need to negotiate. In the future, if both parties agree and there is an opportunity, it may be possible to proceed."</p>

<p>The U.S. seamen's strike has lasted for 13 days, and there is no sign of the unrest subsiding. U.S. mail ships sailing to the Far East have been implicated in the strike. The Pacific Company's Portland and San Francisco routes have no ships coming. Of the four major mail ship routes under the jurisdiction of the Doolan Company (New York, San Francisco, Seattle, and World routes), only the President McKinley is the last ship on its westward mail route to Shanghai today. From then on, no ships will arrive. If the unrest is not resolved soon, U.S. ships traveling west in the Pacific will temporarily disappear from the Far East. U.S. goods handled by major foreign firms in this port, whether loaded or not, cannot be transported to Shanghai, and the import of U.S. goods will also be blocked from today onwards. The magnitude of the loss is difficult to estimate for the time being. As for the export goods from Shanghai to the U.S., Doolan and others are trying to prevent them from being blocked, but loading and unloading will be difficult once they enter the U.S.</p>

<p>At 8:30 PM last night, a Japanese man was shot to death at the entrance of Taoyuan Lane on Baker Road in the Public Concession. The deceased was named Yasuharu Takase, 46 years old, a sailor on the Japanese Mail Steamship Company's Kasagi Maru. Takase was walking at the entrance of Taoyuan Lane with a Japanese woman when he was suddenly shot once by an unknown person. The bullet hit his left chest. The assailant fled without a trace. The Japanese woman who was with him shouted for help and rushed the injured man by car to the Fumin Hospital on North Sichuan Road for treatment. However, because the injury was to a vital part, he died en route before reaching the hospital. Upon receiving the report, the Huishan Police Station immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to the scene to search, together with police officers sent by the Japanese Consulate. It was reported that the Concession police found a .32 caliber Browning pistol and one shell casing at the scene. The Japanese Naval Landing Force also sent a team to guard the area, cutting off pedestrian traffic. They photographed and drew diagrams of the scene. Traffic gradually resumed at 11:15 PM. After receiving the report, the Municipal Government immediately instructed the Public Security Bureau to cooperate with the Concession police to arrest the murderer. The deceased left behind a wife and two children, all in Kobe. The Japanese woman who was with him last night was a waitress at a bar named Abe, 31 years old.</p>
<p>It is also understood that Lu Dingnan, a fruit vendor who has been setting up a stall in the lane, was summoned by the police to inquire about the circumstances of the incident. At present, they are closely pursuing leads to arrest the murderer.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Labor Strike at Japanese Textile Mills Still Serious, Over a Thousand Workers' Petition Blocked, Social Affairs Bureau Sends Representatives to Meet with Funatsu to Discuss, Mills Hold Foremen's Meeting to Plan Resumption of Work, City General Labor Union Holds Emergency Meeting to Discuss Assistance <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Following the joint strike by workers at the Japanese-owned Shanghai Tongxing, Donghua, Dakang, and other mills in the Pudong district of Shanghai, the situation has continued to escalate because the mill owners have not sincerely accepted the five demands of the workers. Yesterday morning at 6:00 AM, over a thousand male and female workers from the mills gathered on Huangxing Road and marched in a procession to the Municipal Government to petition, carrying huge banners with the words "Shanghai Textile Mill Workers' Petition Group Going to the Municipal Government to Petition." Suddenly, several Public Concession Grant Road police cars and Japanese Marines trucks gathered to monitor them. Subsequently, the Yinxianggang Police Station, seeing the large number of people and fearing an accident, sent the entire police force to persuade them to stop. Thirteen representatives from the Shanghai Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth Mills, Tongxing, Dakang, Donghua, and other mills (names withheld at their request) were selected by the workers on the spot and taken to the station for questioning. After receiving the report, Liang Fuchu, Director of the North Station Branch Bureau, also rushed to suppress the situation with a large number of police officers. Fortunately, the Public Security Bureau handled the situation appropriately, so no disturbances occurred.</p>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Representative Visits Funatsu</p>
<p>After receiving the report from the Public Security Bureau, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau immediately sent Zhu Guilin, a mediator from the Third Section, to the Yinxianggang Police Station. He hired cars to escort the thirteen worker representatives from the mills to the Social Affairs Bureau. Wang Xianqing, Director of the Mediation Section of the Third Section, inquired about the truth of the strike and the five demands. He then advised the representatives to inform all workers to wait quietly for a resolution to avoid the expansion of the labor unrest. At 4:30 PM in the afternoon, the Social Affairs Bureau again sent Director Wang, accompanied by mediator Zhu Guilin, to the fourth floor of the Yokohama Specie Bank on the Bund to meet with Funatsu Tatsuiichiro, Chairman of the Japanese Textile Association in China, to inquire about the situation of the various strikes and the attitude of the mills towards this labor unrest. Funatsu replied that the striking mills had already agreed to increase wages by 5%, and the workers' sudden strike was hindering the mills' operations. They ended the conversation at 5:40 PM.</p>
<p>Dakang Still Suspended, Donghua Resumes Work</p>
<p>Since the night shift at the Tengyue Road Dakang Textile Mill joined the strike on the evening of the 10th, yesterday morning at 5:45 AM, the mill sounded the steam whistle and sent several large trucks to the workshops to load Japanese workers onto the trucks. They were escorted by Japanese Marines to work in the mill. They were released at 12:00 PM noon. Because two-thirds of the workers did not stay in the workshops, the machines could not be fully started, so they could not work. The night shift was still suspended. In addition, the Donghua Textile Mill on Huade Road agreed to increase wages and accepted the workers' demands. Yesterday morning, they resumed normal day and night work.</p>
<p>Japanese Textile Mills Hold Managers' Meeting</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, the Japanese Textile Industry Association in China held a meeting of managers of various Japanese textile mills in Shanghai at the Japanese Club at 295 Peng Road. Funatsu, Chairman of the Japanese Textile Industry Association in China, Kuroda from Shanghai, Okajima from Tongyu, Ishida from Donghua, Horiuchi from Dakang, Katsuda from Naigaiwata, Suzuki from Kongda, Tomonaga from Nikka Yuenaga, Hishida from Yufeng, Nishikawa from Toyota, and others from Shihe, totaling more than ten people, attended. Funatsu presided over the meeting until it adjourned at 4:10 PM in the afternoon. The Dagong News Agency reporter met with Funatsu at the Japanese Club yesterday and asked about the content of the meeting. According to his reply, the managers' meeting was to report on the recent situation of the Shanghai and other textile mills that were on strike. They exchanged consistent opinions and did not make any specific decisions. The mill owners had agreed to increase wages by 5% to meet the workers' demands and hoped that the workers would resume work soon. Otherwise, the losses due to the strike may lead to a long-term shutdown. For many years, the textile industry has been in a slump, and most mills have been losing money. There have been frequent reports of Chinese textile mills shutting down or reducing work, but our country's textile mills are more financially secure, so even though they are losing money first, they are still struggling to maintain operations. Just as the situation in the textile industry showed a slight turnaround in the last month or two, the workers demanded wage increases, which is contrary to common sense and hinders the development of industry.</p>
<p>Mills Convene Foremen's Meeting to Discuss</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 1:15 PM, the Japanese-owned Shanghai First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Mills and the Tongxing Second Mill convened a meeting of foremen from various departments, which adjourned at 4:30 PM in the afternoon. According to a foreman who spoke to the Dagong News Agency reporter, the mill owners convened the foremen today (yesterday) to discuss issues such as resuming work. It was decided that the head foremen would notify the workers to resume work and prepare to start the night shift at 6:00 PM this afternoon. After the foremen of the various departments notified the workers, they held a meeting of representatives from the various mills at a certain location. As a result, it was determined that the mills must formally accept the five demands before work could resume.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Hopes for an Early Resolution</p>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reporter went to the Municipal Government to meet with Secretary-General Yu Hongjun yesterday afternoon around 3:00 PM to inquire about how the authorities should handle the labor unrest at the Japanese textile mills. Because Secretary-General Yu was attending a meeting, Secretary Guo Shihui met with him instead. Secretary Guo replied that the Social Affairs Bureau was mediating the labor unrest and the Municipal Government hoped that both parties would meet each other frankly. Under the principle of rationality, they hoped that the labor unrest at the Japanese textile mills would be resolved soon.</p>
<p>City General Labor Union Discusses Assistance</p>
<p>The City General Labor Union believed that the workers at the Japanese textile mills could not bear the oppression of the capitalists. They had put forward five demands, which were not accepted, leading to a labor unrest. So far, it has not been resolved, and the labor unrest is tending to expand. In addition to sending people to investigate the truth, the union convened an emergency meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM to discuss assistance measures. Committee members Zhu Xuefan, Zhou Xuexiang, Li Mengnan, Ye Xianggao, Long Peiyun, Shao Xubai, and others attended. After discussion, they decided to (1) send people to express their condolences, (2) petition the party and government agencies to quickly devise effective measures, and (3) plan effective assistance measures and, if necessary, convene all labor unions in the city to discuss the measures.</p>
<p>Men and Women Missing, Female Worker Injured</p>
<p>When male and female workers from the Japanese-owned Shanghai and other textile mills went to work and left work at the Dakang Textile Mill at 6:00 PM the night before, thousands of people mixed together, causing chaos. A female worker from the Shanghai Second Mill's cotton waste department, living in Laowenyuanfang, was injured in the ear by a wooden stick. In addition, Shi Weixiang, a male worker from the Tongxing B class North Group department and from Yancheng, suddenly went missing. Representatives sent by the workers from the various mills inquired at the Yulin Road and Grant Road police stations and the Dakang Textile Mill, but there was no trace of him.</p>
<p>Textile Mill Area Under Heavy Guard</p>
<p>Since the labor unrest broke out at the Japanese-owned Shanghai and other nine textile mills in the Pudong district, the situation has become increasingly serious. The area from Gongda Second Textile Mill on Yangshupu Road to Dinghai Road on Yangshupu Road, where the textile mills are located, has entered a stage of heavy guard. In addition to the police stations sending Chinese and foreign detectives to be stationed on duty in rotation, yesterday morning around 8:00 AM, nine military vehicles from the Japanese 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, 17th, 18th, and 22nd Divisions, carrying more than 100 soldiers, were distributed along the way. At 11:30 AM, the Japanese Marines' tank and motorcycle team patrolled back and forth on Yangshupu Road, and the security was quite strict.</p>
<p>Strike at Japanese-Owned Meihua Dyeing Factory</p>
<p>The Meihua Printing and Dyeing Factory, opened by a Japanese named Fukuzo on Hejian Road in Pudong, which employs more than 120 male and female workers, also went on strike last night and put forward five demands: (1) a general wage increase of 5 cents per person (calculated daily), (2) no reduction in the number of workers, (3) if the factory's business is slack and wages are not available, meal subsidies should be provided, (4) eating should not interrupt the machines, and the bonus should be increased every month, and (5) the night shift should be counted as one shift at 12:00 AM, and two shifts after 72 hours. Currently, Takahashi, an engineer from the factory, is representing the factory and has agreed to increase wages by 2 cents. Because the conditions are not close to agreement, the unrest is still ongoing.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Wage Increase Issue Resolved at Shenxin First and Eighth Mills <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>A general increase of 5% on the salaries at the Shenxin First and Eighth Textile Mills in Zhoujiaqiao, West Shanghai, the wages of all the workers was decided upon because of the recent strong sales of yarn and the improvement in business. Therefore, the Tenth District Cotton Textile Industry Union petitioned the party and government agencies for a solution. After receiving the petition, the Social Affairs Bureau summoned both labor and management to the bureau for mediation the day before. Because the opinions of the two sides were still difficult to reconcile, mediation was continued again at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Weng Shanhe and Wen Renliang from the labor side, Hua Jianren and Ling Baisheng from the factory side, and Lu Yinchu, a representative from the Municipal Party Headquarters, attended. Zhu Jintao from the Third Section of the Social Affairs Bureau presided over the meeting. After mediation, two resolutions were decided as follows: (1) The wages of day laborers and pieceworkers at the Shenxin First and Eighth Mills who had their wages reduced since September 1 last year will be increased by 5% across the board (the percentage is calculated based on the wages of September 1 last year). (2) If the workload of workers in various departments of the factory has increased since September 1 last year, even if their wages have not been reduced, their existing wages should also be increased by 5% across the board. Both parties expressed satisfaction with the resolution and announced the resolution.</p>

<h3 id="e111">Three Financial Giants: Yoshida Returned to Japan Yesterday Morning; Subtly Promoting Trade with China; Easing Internal Conflicts Within Japan <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Huadong News Agency reports that Yoshida of the Mitsubishi Zaibatsu of Japan (i.e., the manager of the Shanghai branch of Mitsubishi Bank and chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce) took a Japanese ship back to Japan at 9 a.m. yesterday. The ostensible mission is to attend Mitsubishi Bank's affairs. However, after days of investigation and visits by Huadong News Agency reporters, it is learned that he is subtly promoting the import of Japanese goods into China. Since last winter, the smuggling of Japanese goods has indeed made huge profits in the north, undermining China's economic front and ravaging China's financial system. However, on the other hand, it has given the Chinese people extreme stimulation, with mutual warnings not to buy Japanese goods, which has seriously affected legitimate merchants. Therefore, conflicts of interest have arisen between the Mitsubishi and Mitsui factions and those who specialize in smuggling in the north. At present, legitimate Japanese financial circles, in the midst of Sino-Japanese diplomatic discussions, absolutely advocate cautious handling and do not advocate resuming war. Many directors of the Japan-China Trade Association of the Mitsubishi system are also strongly advocating following Britain's lead and implementing credit loans in order to restrain China in a gentle way. Only in this way can so-called credit investment develop its power and functions in the north, and not be monopolized by the Xingzhong Company faction. For nearly two years, in addition to expanding its economic power along the Yangtze River, the Mitsubishi Zaibatsu has been unable to gain a foothold in the north. This time, Yoshida's return to Japan is to present various opinions obtained in Shanghai to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, so that the specific wishes of the Japanese financial community can be stated during diplomatic negotiations.

As for the exchange rates for telegraphic transfers to the UK, USA, France, Germany, Japan, etc., they were the same as the day before yesterday, with no changes.

<p>Yesterday was the third anniversary of the death of the late Director Wen Hongen of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau. Mayor Wu, in memory of the late Director Wen's meritorious service to public security, ordered the Municipal Police Bureau to build a memorial stele for Mr. Wen in the bureau's central courtyard. It was completed a few days ago, and the unveiling ceremony was held yesterday. His family and friends also held the third anniversary commemoration. All parties presented wreaths, which were placed around the stele, and a portrait of Mr. Wen was hung. The ceremony began at 8:30 a.m. Among the participants were Mayor Wu, Director Pan of the Social Affairs Bureau, Director Li of the Health Bureau, Deputy Director Zhao of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, local gentry and merchants Huang Yanpei, Zhu Shaoping, Zhu Yinjiang, and hundreds of staff members and branch directors of the Public Security Bureau. Mayor Wu presided over the ceremony and reported on Mr. Wen's life experience, saying that the late Director Wen was a revolutionary party member who firmly believed in the Three People's Principles, obeyed his superiors, and was loyal to his duties. During the Northern Expedition, he fought in more than ten provinces and districts, and his vanguard reached Machang, making him the first to overthrow the Northern Warlords. When he took office as the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, after the January 28th Incident, he appeased the people, stabilized the local area, and worked diligently day and night. The city gradually recovered its old appearance, and his merits were undeniable. Therefore, he died of overwork. Colleagues and friends of the Public Security Bureau, recalling his past achievements, raised funds to build a memorial stele, which is of profound significance and worthy of emulation, etc. Subsequently, Su Liping, the chief secretary of the Public Security Bureau, delivered a speech on behalf of Director Cai, saying that the memorial stele of the late Director Wen has been erected in the square behind the main hall of this bureau. We should admire it day and night and learn from the virtues of obedience and honesty of the late Director Wen, implement national laws, and consolidate local security, so as not to betray the original intention of establishing the stele. Then, Mr. Huang Yanpei gave a speech saying that the late Director Wen had made contributions to the local area, and the establishment of the memorial stele was the public opinion of all the citizens of the city. He respectfully expressed his utmost respect as a citizen. Finally, Wen Huazhou, the younger brother of the late Director Wen and the chief of the regiment, gave a reply expressing his gratitude. After the ceremony, a group photo was taken and the attendees dispersed.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Women's Use of National Products; Inaugural Meeting Held Yesterday; Election Results to Be Announced Today <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Women's National Products Association held its inaugural meeting yesterday. The inaugural meeting was held at the Zhengyi Society at 3 p.m. yesterday. Over 300 people attended, including Director Pan Gongzhan of the Social Affairs Bureau, Chairman Wang Xiaolai of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Chairman Lin Kanghou of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, Huang Renzhi of the Local Association, Pan Yangyao, Hu Xiyuan, Sun Daosheng, Xu Jianruo, Lin Kecong, Tang Guanyu, and Huang Bingpei. Lin Kecong, Huang Bingpei, and Zhang Jianhua served as the presidium. After the ceremony, Chairman Lin Kecong reported that China's advocacy of national products has been going on for several years, but the annual trade deficit is still increasing. This is due to the fact that Chinese people have become accustomed to using foreign goods. It should be known that various countries exchange goods for our money, causing China's rural social economy to fall into extreme depression. The current method of salvation, in the negative aspect, is only boycott, and in the positive aspect, there is no other way than to promote national products. Mr. Ma Xiangbo once said that family power is in the hands of women, so women can control the fate of the family. Since women are the center of the family, revitalizing the nation is also the duty of the people. Promoting national products can fatally wound the enemy, and promoting national products can also avenge our shame and strive for strength. Now that this association is established, I hope that everyone present will strive to advance towards the great path of promoting national products. Then, Pan Gongzhan gave a speech saying that to avenge shame, in addition to promoting national products, we must also unite from top to bottom and protect our leaders. Wang Xiaolai gave a speech, advocating national products, and must implement not buying things. Then, Lin Kanghou, Huang Renzhi, Liu Wang Liming, and eight-year-old girl Zhang Yinchen followed with speeches. After a brief discussion, (1) the association's charter was discussed and passed, (2) the election of directors to handle association affairs was discussed and a decision was made to elect 15 people. The ballots will be counted today. At the same time, the association solicited products from various national goods manufacturers and distributed them to members, including products from Meiya, Apple, Ma Baoshan, Zhenhua, Meilin, Xin Shenyu, Mali, Zhongfa, Wudi Meifeng, China Chemical, Kangyuan, Jiu Fu, Xinya, Guan Leming, China, Sanyou, Wuhe, Youfeng, China National Goods, Family, China Underwear, Wuzhou, Yongan Tang, Zhanghua, Guanshengyuan, Huasheng Yaguang, Hongxin, Zhongxi, First, Tianchu, Central, Huade, Central, Dadong, Yingyin, Huafu, Wuzhou, Guohua, Huayang, One Wanbaoli, Mingyuanchang, Tianli, Huade, Huayang, Sanyi, China and other manufacturers.</p>

<h3 id="e118">Incidents of Ships in Distress on the Yangtze River; Dehe Collided with the Riverbed at Wuhu; Shengping was Violently Hit by a Large Tugboat <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Dehe's Rudder Chain Broke: The Dehe, owned by British Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., is a regular liner on the Yangtze River with a deadweight of 3,770 tons. This time, it came down from Hankou to Shanghai, carrying many goods and passengers. The Yangtze River water level has been receding rapidly in recent days. The water level between Hankou and Jiujiang is only 9.7 feet according to the water gauge, and the draft is 13.6 feet. The Anqing water gauge is 8.4 feet, and the Wuhu water gauge is only 5.8 feet, with a draft of 10.4 feet, making it extremely difficult for larger Yangtze River ships to navigate. The Dehe arrived in Wuhu yesterday, and its rudder mechanism collided with the riverbed due to the low water level. The Dehe tried hard to pass through this shallow water area, causing the rudder chain to break and the ship to become immobile, stuck in the river. The situation was very bad. The shipowner urgently sent a telegram to Shanghai for help. The company received the report and immediately telegraphed the Xianghe, which has a shallower draft, to rush to the rescue. Yesterday afternoon, another telegram was received stating that the Dehe could be towed back to Shanghai by the Xianghe, but this would be delayed by one day and it would not be able to enter the port until tomorrow. After the ship arrives in Shanghai, the broken rudder chain will have to be repaired, and the loss will be significant.</p>
<p>Shengping Suffered Damage: The Shengping, owned by the Shanghai Minxin Steamship Company, has a deadweight of 4,434 tons, a cargo capacity of 7,040 tons, and a draft of 24.2 feet. It is a very large ship. The ship is currently loading cargo in the outer sea. Yesterday, Minxin Company received a telegram from the captain of the Shengping, stating that the ship was violently hit by a large tugboat near Tumpat Port on the Malay Peninsula, causing a hole to be punched in the outer hull. Only temporary repairs can be made at this time. The details of the loss and the circumstances of the accident have not yet been reported to Shanghai by the shipowner.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Doctor of Literature Cao Shanxiang Sentenced for Two Counts of Fraud; Fine of 200 Yuan to Be Enforced <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Cao Shanxiang, a native of Ningbo with a Ph.D. in Literature from the University of Michigan in the United States, had a friendly relationship with Sheng Qingcheng, a native of Wukang and the director of the Hudong Hospital on Yangshupu Road. He once told Sheng that he was a classmate of Shi Ying, the mayor of Nanjing, and could arrange for a contract to handle the cleaning affairs of the capital city. Sheng immediately gave him 1,000 yuan for expenses. However, after Cao obtained the money, he disappeared without a trace. At the end of last year, he defrauded Luo Zhenting of 3,000 yuan on the pretext of seeking a position as a bureau chief. Recently, Cao was detained by the French Concession police for another case and brought to the Second Special District Local Court for interrogation. After the Xinzha Police Station learned of this, they found that Sheng had filed a lawsuit against Cao for defrauding him of money, and the First Special District Local Court had issued an arrest warrant. Therefore, they sent detective Ye Yushan to the Second Special Court to transfer Cao to the First Special Court for detention. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, Judge Pan Zhenyang opened the court to summon Sheng Qingcheng and Luo Zhenting, who had been defrauded, and brought Cao to court for questioning. Qian Xunjiu, the lawyer of the police station, explained the case and presented the confession of the defendant in the police station regarding his relationship with Sheng. He said that the defendant's confession was intended to discredit Sheng and Luo, who had accused him of being a "falling dog." Subsequently, Luo and Sheng explained the circumstances of being defrauded by Cao. When questioned, Cao denied the fraud, only admitting that he had borrowed the money from Luo and Sheng, and that they had all reconciled. He also hired lawyer Zhu Honglie to defend him. After the interrogation, Judge Pan immediately announced the judgment that Cao Shanxiang was guilty of two counts of fraud, each with a fine of 150 yuan, and the enforced fine was 200 yuan. If he was unable to pay the fine, he would be required to serve labor for one day per two yuan. He was also ordered to return 800 yuan to Sheng Qingcheng and allowed to provide a 200 yuan security bond.</p>

<p>In a house at No. 23 Songbai Lane in the jurisdiction of the North Sichuan Road Police Station, a Korean drug dealer was secretly selling heroin. Yesterday afternoon at around 3 p.m., interpreter Miao Xien led police officers and Japanese consulate police officer Nojo to the address for a search. A Korean woman named Quan Yangcai was arrested on the spot, and 550 packets of heroin were found. The Japanese police officer took her back to the Japanese consulate for interrogation. Subsequently, Zhao Fudi, a native of Nantong, was arrested, and four packets of heroin were found on his person. After interrogation at the police station, he was transferred to the bureau for further investigation due to the involvement of highly toxic drugs.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Lawsuit Involving Promotion of Secret Mark Coupons and Suspension of Interest Payments; China Industrial Bank Should Pay Fuyuan Interest; Initial Trial Has Been Judged, But Defendant Appeals Again; Case Concluded After Interrogation, Judgment to Be Announced on the 16th <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Shen Guangyan, the manager of the Shanghai China Industrial Bank, was previously sued in the civil court of the First Special District Court by Shi Hongdong, the manager of Fuyuan Silver Company, for non-payment of interest. Lawyer Qu Qian was engaged to file the lawsuit. The grounds for the lawsuit were that the defendant wanted to promote its bank notes and entered into a contract with the plaintiff, Fuyuan Silver Company, on April 22, 1933, in accordance with the prevailing practice of secret mark coupons among banks in Shanghai.</p>
<p>400,000 Yuan</p>
<p>For a term of five years, the plaintiff paid a large amount of printing fees according to the amount received and made every effort to promote the coupons, so that the agreed amount was fully circulated in the market. The defendant also paid the interest due in two installments each year, with an interest passbook as proof. Initially, the matter was handled on schedule and according to the agreement, without any objections. However, the defendant, citing the government's announcement of</p>
<p>Legal Tender Policy</p>
<p>Claimed that the aforementioned interest would be paid up to November 3 of the same year, and that the interest thereafter would be paid only when the formal contract was terminated. The plaintiff argued that Article 7 of the contract with the defendant stated that "The validity period of this contract is limited to five years. In the event of special circumstances, Fuyuan will be notified by public letter, and the contract will only be canceled after Fuyuan's consent." It can be seen that the cancellation of the contract requires the consent of both parties. Even if there are special circumstances,</p>
<p>Fuyuan's consent</p>
<p>Is still required. Therefore, the plaintiff had to file a lawsuit with your court. Subsequently, an out-of-court settlement was reached, and the defendant paid the money in full. The case was then withdrawn. On June 21 of this year, the time to pay the installment for the first half of this year arrived again. After repeated reminders, the defendant continued to delay. The plaintiff entrusted lawyer Qu Qian to send letters to urge payment, but to no avail. In order to protect its rights, the plaintiff had no choice but to file a lawsuit, requesting the court to order the defendant to pay 5,600 yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>Initial Judgment</p>
<p>The defendant should pay the plaintiff 5,600 yuan in national currency, and the litigation costs should be borne by the defendant. However, the China Industrial Bank refused to accept the judgment and, through lawyer Shan Yuhua, filed an appeal with the Second Branch of the High Court. Yesterday afternoon, Presiding Judge Han Zuzhi, accompanied by judges Zhang and Yu, took the seat and conducted a joint hearing. Witness Jin Lingyun testified. Subsequently, the arguments began. Lawyer Shan Yuhua, representing the appellant, requested the court to overturn the original judgment and dismiss the plaintiff's claim in the first instance. Lawyer</p>
<p>Qu Qian stated</p>
<p>That the appellant's grounds for appeal attacked the contract submitted by the appellee for not meeting the term of years. However, the contract submitted by the appellee was indeed for five years, and there were no signs of alteration. It was also stamped with the seal of Deputy Manager Jin Lingyun, who had the authority to enter into the contract, and there was no doubt about it. Therefore, it should be legally effective, and the appeal should be dismissed. The appellant should also bear the litigation costs of this instance, and the first instance judgment should be maintained and declared provisionally enforceable in accordance with Article 454 of the Civil Procedure Law. The court will render a judgment on the case on the 16th.</p>

<p>Recently, the Sichuan Store, known for specializing in Sichuan white fungus, had its Nanjing Road headquarters and Qiaochang branch suddenly approached by Xie Jufang, residing at No. 1 Hexing Lane, Jiangyuan Lane, Xinzha Road, Shan Anren, residing at No. 13 Ba Huo Lane, Huagen Road, and a Zhang woman (upstairs of the Xiyuan Bathhouse) residing on Lanwei'ai Road, Lao Ximen, who successively presented Sichuan Store four-yuan gift certificates to redeem goods. The store had never issued any kind of gift certificate, and it was clear that they were counterfeit. When questioned, all three individuals claimed that they were gifts from friends. The store considered this matter to be related to the store's reputation and to involve the criminal offense of forgery. It was immediately sent to the Central Police Station for investigation. More details will be reported after further investigation.</p>

<p>Recently, it has been discovered that there is a "National Air Defense Research Association" in the city that publishes a book entitled "National Air Defense Knowledge," which is being peddled and used to solicit donations. It is falsely claiming the names of relevant organizations and leaders in the city and making a show of it. It is heard that several months ago, someone had made a similar rumor to the China Travel Service. The former China Aviation Association sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau requesting an investigation into whether the establishment of the National Air Defense Research Association had been registered with the party and government agencies in accordance with the prescribed procedures. The reply stated that the Municipal Party Department had not received any application for registration from the National Air Defense Research Association. This shows that it is a rumor, and people from all walks of life should be careful not to be deceived.</p>

He was transferred to the Northern Railway Station Branch two months ago. He was known for his diligence and integrity, highly regarded by his superiors. However, at around 1:30 AM yesterday, while Officer Dong was on duty at Post No. 16, located at the intersection of Shi Tong Road and Zhongxing Road, he was suddenly attacked by a group of thugs wielding knives and axes, who inflicted four or five wounds to his head and face, resulting in his immediate death. His body collapsed on Zhongxing Road. A rickshaw puller named Shi Wanqing, who was passing by, noticed the body and reported it to the police officer at Post No. 14, who then reported to the branch. Director Liang of the branch personally led a team of senior officers to investigate. They found the surrounding area of the post and the seat inside were covered in blood. It is believed that while the officer was on watch, the thugs launched a sudden attack. Officer Dong resisted with all his strength, but eventually succumbed to his injuries. The officer's service revolver was also stolen. Only a felt hat left behind by the assailants was found at the scene, covered with numerous fingerprints and blood stains. Director Liang was extremely enraged after the inspection, stating that such thugs dared to openly kill public servants with weapons within his jurisdiction, showing utter disregard for the law. He has ordered a strict investigation to apprehend the culprits and bring them to justice. He has also reported the incident to the headquarters and requested the local court to conduct an autopsy. It is reported that the deceased is survived by a wife and a five-year-old daughter. According to Officer Dong's colleagues, he had no known enemies. It is suspected that this tragedy occurred because the thugs intended to steal the officer's firearm, and when the officer resisted, he met with misfortune.</p>

<p>Xi Ehan (also known as Laichun), a wealthy Suzhou merchant residing in Shanghai, is over seventy years old and owns considerable property in Shanghai. Recently, Nie Guizhi, a thirty-year-old woman from Yushan, Jiangxi, hired lawyer Qian Yuan to file a complaint with the First Special Court's Criminal Division, accusing Xi of abandonment and demanding 36,000 yuan in civil damages. The gist of the complaint states that the plaintiff lost her father at a young age and lived with her mother. In [month missing] of the 23rd year of the Republic [1934], the plaintiff fled the war to Hangzhou, where she was introduced to the defendant. The defendant boasted about his wealth and comfortable life, proposing to take the plaintiff as a concubine. The plaintiff, seeing that the defendant was elderly but had a dignified demeanor, readily agreed. They then engaged in sexual relations and soon came to Shanghai, where they lived together at No. 30, Lane 6, Jishan Lane, East West Huade Road. For two years, their relationship was harmonious. In February of last year, the couple returned to Yushan to visit the plaintiff's mother. The defendant returned to Shanghai first and urged the plaintiff to return. In September of the same year, the plaintiff came to Shanghai with her mother. However, in April of this year, the plaintiff</p>
<p>Returned to Her Hometown with Her Mother</p>
<p>And came to Shanghai in July. Unexpectedly, the defendant refused to take her in, effectively abandoning her. The plaintiff argues that the defendant's behavior of starting and then abandoning the relationship constitutes the crime of abandonment under Article 293 of the Criminal Code and should be prosecuted according to the law. In addition, she is filing a civil suit, demanding monthly living expenses of 100 yuan for a period of thirty years, totaling</p>
<p>Thirty-Six Thousand</p>
<p>Yuan. The court granted the request and ordered a summons to be issued. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Risheng presided over the hearing in Criminal Court No. 8. The defendant, Xi Laichun, did not appear. The plaintiff's lawyer, Qian Yuan, stated that the defendant is a man of considerable means and that his residence is at No. 21, Mashi Road, Hangzhou, and he also owns a villa in Qingdao. He requested that the hearing be rescheduled. Judge Huang adjourned the case to the afternoon of the 20th of this month for further questioning of the defendant, Xi Laichun.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Land Acquisition for Heping Road: Property Owner Objects; Liu Xiang, a Lawyer, Sues the Court and Orders the Public Works Bureau to Compensate; Mediation Fails Yesterday, Formal Lawsuit to Follow <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Lawyer Liu Xiang, courtesy name Jiren, previously owned a house located outside the Old West Gate on Zhaojiabang Road, now renamed Heping Road, at the streetcar turning point. The Shanghai Municipal Public Works Bureau planned to widen this section of the road and needed to acquire more than three zhang of his land. He considered the handling unfair and the losses too great, so in December of the 18th year of the Republic [1929], he submitted a petition to the Public Works Bureau requesting a change. The Public Works Bureau replied on December 13th of the same year, stating that the widening of roads and acquisition of land in the city would be handled in accordance with the "Temporary Regulations for Road Construction and Land Acquisition Fees," and that there was no</p>
<p>Undue Favoritism or Discrimination</p>
<p>Regarding the gains and losses of properties on both sides of the road. The request to change the route was related to the finalized plan and could not be approved. Liu then filed an administrative appeal with the Shanghai Municipal Government, which was rejected. Liu appealed again to the Ministry of Interior, which also upheld the Shanghai Municipal Government's decision. Liu, dissatisfied, filed a lawsuit with the Executive Yuan last year. Because Shanghai's administrative litigation, with the Public Prosecution Office as the main body, was unprecedented, his property tenant, Yu Nankui, also participated in the lawsuit. The main points of Liu Xiang's plea were: (1) The</p>
<p>Road Width</p>
<p>Was already stipulated to be 20 meters, so it should not be illegally expanded beyond 20 meters. (2) The original road system plan did not explicitly state where special widening was required, and the area was not particularly prosperous or have entertainment venues. A width of 20 meters would not obstruct traffic. The so-called plaza was merely an excuse by the Public Works Bureau. (3) According to Article 15 of the Land Expropriation Law, land expropriation should go through a negotiation process, which refers to whether the land should be slightly acquired and how many dimensions should be acquired. The Public Works Bureau</p>
<p>Did Not Negotiate</p>
<p>Which was clearly illegal. The defendant's official reply clarified that negotiation only referred to land prices, which was a misunderstanding. (4) Suzhou widened the Gongxiang Road, and some people requested reducing the width. The Shanghai United Transportation Station also temporarily suspended construction due to land acquisition issues, indicating that land acquisition plans could be altered to safeguard the interests of the people. He requested that the original decision and original disposition be revoked and that the road width be changed to 21 meters. Yu Nankui's</p>
<p>Reasons for Participating</p>
<p>Were roughly as follows: The participant leased the plaintiff's land in the 18th year of the Republic [1929] to establish the Hu Nan Food and Entertainment Company. The Public Works Bureau's expropriation of land beyond 20 meters hindered reconstruction. Dongmen Road has heavy traffic, but the road width is only 38 feet. Heping Road should not be further expropriated beyond 20 meters. The participant suffered indirect losses and therefore participated in support. After the court notified the Ministry of Interior to respond, they stated that (1) The Municipal Government announced the road width within its legal authority. The</p>
<p>Enlargement of the Plaza</p>
<p>To increase the area at road intersections was still within the scope of its authority and did not conflict with the Municipal Organization Law. (2) Negotiating the land price was part of the expropriation process and could be handled according to law. The people had no right to oppose the authority of the administrative agency. (3) The cases of Suzhou widening Gongxiang Road, reducing the width, and temporarily suspending construction of the Shanghai United Transportation Station were changes made by the competent authority and were different from this case. After reviewing the arguments of both parties, the court stated that the municipal government directly under the Executive Yuan,</p>
<p>Expropriating Land</p>
<p>When undertaking public works, in addition to the expansion of public roads stipulated in Article 10 of the Land Expropriation Law, which allows the competent authority to make its own decision when demolishing people's houses, should prepare a project proposal with a map and submit it to the Ministry of Interior of the National Government for approval and announcement, as clearly stipulated in Articles 8 and 9 of the Land Expropriation Law. It can be seen that the road widening case was originally a public work. The required land, in addition to other methods of directly purchasing it from the landowners, can be expropriated according to law, but must follow the</p>
<p>Clearly Defined Order</p>
<p>To handle. In this case, the Shanghai Municipal Public Works Bureau believed that it was necessary to acquire more than three zhang of the plaintiff's land to widen the road. The plaintiff argued that the acquisition was excessive and lodged an objection. The original disposition rejected the plaintiff's request, stating that the land acquisition would be handled in accordance with the "Temporary Regulations for Road Construction and Land Acquisition Fees." However, Article 3 of the "Temporary Regulations for Road Construction and Land Acquisition Fees" stipulates that all land acquisition for road construction shall be handled in accordance with the Land Expropriation Law promulgated by the National Government. The court found that the original disposition authority did not</p>
<p>Present for Approval According to Law</p>
<p>The land acquisition case. The eastern road system of the Hu Nan district, approved and announced by the Municipal Government, was originally a road improvement plan. Since it was necessary to demolish people's houses, Article 2 of the Land Expropriation Law could not be applied. Before approval by the legal authority, it was difficult to consider that there was a basis for expropriation. Furthermore, Article 2 of the Shanghai Municipal Road Widening Regulations states that all buildings that obstruct the road alignment should be taken in at once during reconstruction according to the alignment. Also, Article 3, which states that property owners follow the</p>
<p>Alignment and Take In</p>
<p>The land, the Municipal Government should pay the full amount of compensation in accordance with the regulations. This provision can only apply to those who agree to the purchase, so there is no need to go through the expropriation process. It does not mean that the land expropriation procedure, which is already legally prescribed, can be changed by separate regulations. The conclusion is that, based on the above, the actual receipt of compensation is equivalent to a consensual purchase. If the landowner objects to the acquisition, they can only follow the Land Expropriation Law. After reporting to the authorities, if the rights cannot be obtained through agreement, a</p>
<p>Expropriation Review Committee should be organized to discuss and decide. In this case, the plaintiff</p>
<p>Had Objections to the Land Acquisition</p>
<p>If the original disposition authority considered that it was necessary to acquire the land according to the prescribed plan, it should have reported to the Municipal Government in accordance with the provisions of the Expropriation Law, which would be proper. It was illegal to simply reject the application. The decisions of the administrative appeal and the second administrative appeal were both inappropriate and should be revoked. As to whether there was a need to build a square on the land in question and how much to acquire, these were all within the scope of the expropriation plan. Since it had not been approved and announced, the plaintiff's request to determine that the road width was 20 meters was</p>
<p>Irrefutable</p>
<p>However, the original disposition authority did not complete the legal procedures for land acquisition. The plaintiff's accusation of illegality was not without reason. Therefore, the court ruled that the Municipal Public Works Bureau should report to the Municipal Government and follow the procedures stipulated in the Land Expropriation Law. Now Liu Xiang is holding this judgment and has repeatedly urged action without success, so he has applied for mediation in the Shanghai District Court, ordering the Director of the Public Works Bureau, Shen Yi, to compensate for the loss of 20,652 yuan. Yesterday, the judge opened the court. Shen Yi delegated Hu Tingji (who previously measured Liu's land) as his agent. According to Liu Xiang's statement, he was not notified at the time, but rather notified of demolition. This was Hu Tingji abusing his power for personal gain. Hu said the defendant should be the Ministry of Interior and there was no need for mediation. Therefore, the mediation failed, and a formal lawsuit will be filed.</p>

Today, the association gathers representatives from all over the country to work together with one heart and one mind, express their opinions, and see that the association's affairs will be developed even more in the future. At this time of serious national crisis, I hope that our industry will always uphold the heart of saving people is saving ourselves, and benefiting people is benefiting ourselves, to jointly seek the welfare of the industry, benefit society, and fulfill the national duty.

<p>— Edited by China Credit</p>
<p>(1) Bank of China Establishes New York Branch: The establishment of this branch was the result of negotiations between Mr. Chen Guangfu, Executive Director of the bank, and the US Department of the Treasury during his visit to the United States. With the establishment of the Sino-US Monetary Agreement, further cooperation between the banking sectors of China and the United States became necessary. Therefore, the Bank of China decided to establish a branch in New York, and invited Mr. Wang Zhengxu and American Mr. Bozes to be the managers of the branch. This marks the beginning of the direct participation of Chinese banks in the American market.</p>
<p>(2) Hua'an Commercial Savings Bank Undergoes Forced Liquidation: The bank was initiated by Hu Chunxiang, Zhang Danru, and others. Preparations began in the winter of 1932, and the shareholders' meeting was established in May of the following year. It officially opened on July 4, with a fully paid-up capital of 50 million yuan, operating commercial and savings businesses. Mr. Yu Shicheng served as the Chairman of the Board, and Mr. Hu Chunxiang served as the General Manager. Since its opening, business was initially thriving. In the first year, deposits reached 1.3 million yuan. In recent years, due to the impact of the economic downturn, many loans could not be recovered on time, and since the opening of the China Communications Savings Department, most depositors withdrew their deposits and transferred them, leading to a decline in business and stagnation of capital. The organizers convened a temporary shareholders' meeting on June 30, but it was adjourned due to insufficient attendance. Unable to do otherwise, in addition to rescheduling the shareholders' meeting for the 29th of this month, the bank moved its address from 271 Ningbo Road to 73 Ningbo Road, and reduced staff to save expenses. At the same time, it stopped accepting deposits and granting loans, focusing on liquidation matters. When the shareholders' meeting was held on the 29th, the board's proposal was passed, formally announcing the forced liquidation.</p>
<p>(3) Reorganization of Shanghai Silk Industry Commercial Savings Bank: The bank was founded on September 1, 1933, by silk industry leaders Wang Yansong, Luo Qinghua, and others. Initially, the capital was set at 500,000 yuan, but due to enthusiastic subscriptions, it was increased to 600,000 yuan. A five-story building was built on Hankou Road, and Mr. Wang Yansong was appointed as Chairman of the Board and General Manager. Later, due to the development of business, the original funds were still insufficient, so the capital was increased to 1.2 million yuan, and the bank joined the Shanghai Banking Association and the Shanghai Clearing House. Last year, the bank pioneered the acceptance bill system, which was highly valued by the financial community. Recently, due to the impact of the economic downturn, and because Mr. Wang was tired of his duties, there was a bank run. In order to revitalize the business, the bank's board of directors specially hired Mr. Lu Zidong, General Manager of Jiangsu Bank, to serve concurrently as the bank's manager, and the Bank of China, the Central Bank, and the Bank of Communications fully provided capital to revitalize the business.</p>

<p>Since the French Concession Hard Court Tennis Championships began on October 31st, most of the finals berths have been decided as of yesterday. Except for one mixed and one women’s doubles semi-final match, which will be resolved on Sunday morning, the men’s singles and doubles finals week are occupied by Chinese players, which is the most glorious page since the French Concession hard court tennis began. There are no matches today or tomorrow, and the finals will be held separately on Saturday and Sunday. Tickets are all one yuan. The current situation of the championships is as follows:</p>

<p>Ma Anquan Defeats Coracha</p>
<p>After Zhou Guanjun and Wang Shuzi successively lost in the right half of the men's singles, only Ma Anquan was left to hold the fort for the Chinese players. Yesterday, Mr. Ma had to play two matches in a row. The first match was against the Portuguese star Coracha, which was held at 1:30 PM. Coracha is known as a tough opponent, but he was in poor condition yesterday. Except for one service game won by Coracha in the second set, Ma easily won the rest, ending the set 6-1. In the second set, Ma broke Coracha's serve, and Coracha broke Ma's serve in the next game, tying the score at 1-1. After that, Ma won two more games in a row. Coracha managed to win a game with his serve in the fifth game, but then slumped again. Ma, on the other hand, was unusually spirited and ended the set 6-2. In total, they battled for fifteen games.</p>
<p>Ma Wins Quickly Against Kanafaro</p>
<p>After defeating his strong opponent Coracha, Ma Anquan faced Kanafaro in the semi-finals at 3:30 PM. Mr. Ma continued his momentum, using long shots and short drops with great skill, making Kanafaro exhausted. Ma had the serve in this match. Except for the third game of the first set, which was broken by Kanafaro, resulting in a win for Kanafaro, the rest were like crushing dry weeds. Ma quickly ended the set 6-1. In the second set, Ma was even more courageous, winning a shutout set and defeating Kanafaro to advance to the finals week.</p>
<p>Shen Zhen Loses to Li Bizu</p>
<p>Shen and Li are outstanding players among the Chinese. They have defeated foreign players in the past few days. Yesterday's match was the key to winning a finals berth. Both sides showed their skills, fighting a fierce battle. In the first set, Li initially showed the power of Pu Ma, winning three games in a row. Shen, an old general on the battlefield, was not flustered and calmly responded. As a result, he turned defeat into victory. Li was stunned, winning only one game and losing 4-6. In the second set, Li Bizu carefully fought back and achieved victory. In the final set, Li’s courage was not exhausted, and he defeated his strong opponent 6-2 to win a finals berth.</p>
<p>The Hu-Li Team Luckly Wins a Finals Berth</p>
<p>The team of Hu Xuguang and Li Guofan was supposed to meet Kocher and Mastot in yesterday's match. Kocher and Ma are outstanding among the foreign players. They had a tough battle against the Kremlinoffs to win the semi-finals. Although Hu and Li are brave, it was unknown who would win against these two. Unexpectedly, luck came beyond expectations. Kocher and Ma were late yesterday, and according to the rules, they were deemed to have forfeited the match. Thus, Hu and Li won a finals berth without any effort.</p>
<p>The Married Couple Succeeds, Easily Takes Zhou-Yan</p>
<p>The Chinese mixed doubles team Yan Jingjiang and Zhou Shejun met the strong Kremlinoff couple yesterday. Mr. Kremlinoff’s shots were sharp and quick, and Mrs. Kremlinoff was steady and pleasing. Yan and Zhou were often trapped. The Kremlinoffs were active in the first set, and although Yan and Zhou tried to counterattack, they did not succeed. Soon, the score became 4-1. The Kremlinoffs continued their efforts and won the set 6-3. Zhou Guanjun performed very well in the second set, creating a 5-5 tie, which was temporarily encouraging. The Kremlinoffs attacked fiercely, and Yan and others fought to the death. In the last two games, the competition was extremely fierce. Eventually, Zhou and Yan lost again due to slightly loose coordination.</p>

<p>Ticket Sales Will Begin Soon</p>
<p>Regarding the performance by world professional tennis player Tilden Barnes in Shanghai on the 20th of this month, a contract was signed on the eve of Tilden's departure from Shanghai (the 6th). The remuneration is still a 4-6 split, with Tilden getting 60% (the reason for the previously reported 3-7 split was due to other complications; the actual split is 4-6). Tickets are divided into three categories: 5 yuan, 3 yuan, and 2 yuan. The 5 yuan tickets are for the first to third rows, numbered, totaling 540 seats. The 3 yuan seats are from the fourth to tenth rows (formerly the 5 yuan seats), unnumbered. The 2 yuan seats are the former 3 yuan general admission seats. Tickets will be available for sale around the 14th. However, even if all tickets are sold, only about 8,000 yuan can be obtained, which is at least 2,520 yuan less than the previous performance. Although Tilden and others will only receive 6,216 yuan in national currency for this performance, accounting for 60% of the total income of 10,367 yuan, equivalent to about 1,800 US dollars, they are extremely interested in our country. It is said that because of his advancing age, he will not be able to endure long sea voyages, and it will be difficult to fulfill his wish to revisit our country in the future. However, he is deeply impressed by the high level of tennis enthusiasm in our country, and wishes to have a second opportunity to work together. Therefore, he has agreed with Barnes to invite three more first-class professionals next summer to come to Shanghai again, and then continue to Nanjing, Hankou, Tianjin, Beijing, and other places.</p>
<p>In addition, tennis enthusiasts in this city plan to invite Tilden to perform in Beijing after his performance on the 20th. They are currently in contact with Tilden by telegram and with Tilden's agent in Shanghai, but have not yet received a reply. It is expected that the President McKinley, General Pershing, and Customer Wheel will depart for the United States on the 24th of this month and will arrive in San Francisco on the 13th of next month, only four days later than the Lincoln Wheel, and will be able to make it in time for the Christmas holidays. Therefore, it may be possible to invite Tilden to agree to participate in a performance match hosted by Chinese players.</p>

<h3 id="e164">Privately Funded Students Studying in Japan Must Obtain Certificates of Study Abroad and Submit Them to the Study Abroad Management Agency for Verification; Otherwise, the Ministry of Education Will Not Recognize Their Qualifications <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, the number of Chinese students studying in Japan at their own expense has increased sharply. Many of them have followed the regulations of the Ministry of Education to complete the study abroad procedures. However, there are also quite a few who have gone abroad without obtaining a certificate of study abroad, or who have obtained a certificate of study abroad but have not reported to the Office of Supervision of Students Studying in Japan. In view of this, the Ministry of Education has reiterated its previous order and notified all schools above the junior college level that the qualifications of students studying in Japan at their own expense must meet the standards stipulated in the Ministry's Regulations on Studying Abroad. Their study abroad expenses and all their behaviors must be reliably guaranteed, approved by the Ministry, and issued with a certificate of study abroad before they can go abroad. After arriving in the country of study, they must submit the certificate of study abroad to the study abroad management agency in the country for verification and registration within two weeks. Otherwise, the Ministry of Education will absolutely not recognize it. Therefore, before going abroad, privately funded students studying in Japan must obtain a certificate of study abroad from the Ministry and report to the study abroad management agency after arriving in the country of study before their qualifications for studying abroad can be recognized.</p>

<h3 id="e167">Zhang Runruo Lectures on Sound Bin: "Support the Leader" and Self-Reliance for National Salvation (2) <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>2.  Regarding the relationship between leaders and the people, we must first recognize the connection between the nation and the individual, national strength and self-reliance, leaders and the people, and centripetal force and automatic power.</p>
<p>Speaking of the connection between the individual and the nation, the nation is an organism, and the individual is the cell that constitutes the life of the nation. My body is the cell of the nation, and my life is a part of the nation. On the one hand, the individual and the nation have an inseparable, interdependent, and unified connection; on the other hand, they each have their own special functions. As citizens, we should each do our best and fulfill our responsibilities to strive to meet the overall needs (Note 3).</p>
<p>Speaking of the connection between national strength and self-reliance, the development of the nation is based on the excellence of the people's intelligence, morality, and physical fitness. Without the development of the people's intelligence, morality, and physical fitness, there is no possibility of substantial national strength. We must contribute our individual intelligence and talents to the nation and gather the economic, moral, spiritual, and physical strength of the people to create a strong national strength. Therefore, the prerequisite for strengthening national strength depends on whether the cells of the nation's life, that is, every citizen, can fulfill their national duties to strive to meet the overall needs and to strive to improve the nation's functions (Note 4).</p>
<p>Speaking of the connection between leaders and the people, and centripetal force and automatic power, the development of any ethnic nation must have two important conditions: on the one hand, the development of the concept of the nation; on the other hand, the self-awareness of national responsibility. The reason why the world's great powers can soar and advance rapidly is based on the promotion of these two historical forces. Human beings, in any era, must have two qualifications: on the one hand, as a member of the collective; on the other hand, as an independent self (Note 5). From the former point of view, we need the centripetal force to support the leader; from the latter point of view, we need the automatic power of the people.</p>
<p>The reason why the Chinese nation has today's decline is due to the disconnection of the above-mentioned various positions. On the one hand, there is a lack of a unified and centripetal national concept, so we are selfish, harm the public for personal gain, do not abide by discipline, and cannot unite. On the other hand, we are accustomed to decadence and do not think about revitalizing. The general public is dominated by the inertia of history since the Jin, Wei, and Six Dynasties, which has formed a decadent nature of mechanical extremes, completely disappearing the individual's sense of responsibility to the nation and the automatic power to society (Note 6).</p>
<p>Therefore, today's work of national salvation should be planned and taken care of in both aspects. On the one hand, we need a wise leader; on the other hand, we should focus on the training of the people. Leaders are very important, but the relationship between leaders and the people is like the tip of a pyramid and the bottom line. We must have a healthy and large public as its foundation, so that we can rely on it without falling. Even if the leader's ability surpasses the group, he is not three heads and six arms, and he is still beyond his reach. At least we need people with motivation as his backing, and then we can complement each other and achieve twice the result with half the effort. Otherwise, it is like a row of axles that are broken and dilapidated. Even if the machine in the front of the car is powerful, it cannot leap forward.</p>
<p>The reason why the Soviet Union after the revolution has today's construction achievements and national strength development is not only due to the strength of their ruling class, but also the result of their first leaders training and educating the people. The basic driving force for the revival of Germany after the war is also the inherent spirit of perseverance, fortitude, hard work, and self-improvement of their people. The rise of Hitler was caused by the times, and the development of the National Socialist Party (allowed to be the norm in German history (Note 7). Moreover, as after Mussolini ruled Italy, he was always deeply concerned about the danger of "the government ceasing when the person dies." Therefore, he was very concerned about the training of the people. Those who do not know think that Mussolini's success is based on Machiavelli's hegemony, but they do not know that Mussolini's ability to promote Italy has other underlying driving forces. Mussolini believes that the decline of a country is due to the spirit of the people. Therefore, on the one hand, he vigorously reformed the political institutions to strengthen the centripetal force, and on the other hand, he worked hard to cultivate the spirit of the people to inspire their inherent virtues of struggle, hard work, thrift, generosity, courage, enthusiasm, and sympathy, so that the people of the whole country can be powerful and inherit the great historical mission of glorifying the nation's life.</p>
<p>Here, we should know that the success of a leader is not accidental or achievable by luck. We must have the people of the whole country able to exert their automatic ability as the backing of the leader before we can engage in long-term struggle and hold the left coupon of victory. If the people of the whole country have a mentality of dependence and do not change their decadent habits, and let the leader fight alone without supporting him, then the effect of seizing the door will be twice the result with half the effort. Even if there is success, it will be difficult to maintain for a long time. Learning from the past is the teacher of the future. Therefore, if we truly love the leader, the method of supporting the leader is not in false praise, nor in temporary excitement, but in the down-to-earth, hard-working training of the people of the whole country and the cultivation of the people's motivation, so that the people of the whole country, regardless of scholars, farmers, workers, businessmen, men, women, old and young, can all be in their own positions, recognize their tasks, and complete their great duties to the country and society, so as to reduce the leader's hard work and share the leader's heavy responsibilities, and concentrate the automatic power of the whole people to help the leader and be used by the leader. Then the leader and the people will be like fish in water, complementing each other. In this way, the leader's hard work and the people's efforts can be balanced and advance together to jointly complete the historical mission of national salvation and revival with hardship and hardship.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange experienced an unexpected surge in market prices, and the trend never softened. It may be too early to say that it is a sign of improved times, or that there is a new agreement with the United States. In fact, the short covering and the full-day buying on the 5th were all related. Most of them are still speculative in nature. From the opening to the closing yesterday morning, the prices rose without falling. The opening price rose by 3 to 6 cents, the settlement price rose by another 3 cents, and the afternoon rose by another 1 to 3 cents. The closing price still rose by 2 to 3 cents. The most active buyers were those who bought the full day on the 5th. The others, such as No. 33, 34, 47, and 53, also followed suit and took consistent actions. The chips on the market suddenly felt scarce. Although No. 4 and No. 11 actively sold, they turned long again. The depressed situation of the past few days suddenly unfolded. Since the interest payment, this is the highest record. Although there is still hope for continued negotiations in the future, the bulls are already crowded, and a pullback must be prevented. As a result, the market prices rose by 7.5 cents to 1.35 yuan. The total turnover was 16,085,000 yuan. The results of the price increases and decreases are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

However, the sellers also actively sold high, and soon there was a slight pullback. However, because Dachangxiang, Yuanmao, and Yong were particularly smooth in their intake at this time, the HSBC Bank's listing was announced, both the British and US markets were flat, and it was still stable. Although the White Silver Balance Tax announcement rose by 5.75 points, it had no impact. Later, because the buyers felt satisfied, the shorts took the opportunity to suppress, and once turned down. However, the large buyers continued to come in at the low price, and the market was stable at noon. Now I will record the market situation for half a day,</p>
<p>The morning opening was 1154.1 yuan, a decrease of 0.5 yuan from the previous close.

London's raw gold shrank by one penny, the British market rose by 25 against the US market, the British market did not move against the French market, the US market rose by 0.0625 against the British market, and the US market rose by 0.0875 against the French market.

Compared with the previous close, the British exchange was slightly tight and the US dollar was slightly loose. After the opening, Chinese merchants still supplied slightly, and the banks still dug. The HSBC Bank's listing was announced, both the British and US markets were flat, but still flat. After entering, the White Silver Balance Tax announcement rose by 5.75 points, but because the Nikkei Bank dumped physical exchange rates, the banks swapped exchange rates and there was no change.

<h3 id="e176">Chaozhou Red Rice Production Price Rises by Two Yuan <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>According to a letter from Shantou yesterday, the production price of Chaozhou red rice has recently increased by nearly two yuan, while the exchange rate has also dropped by more than thirty yuan, to a level of 1,232 yuan. The cost is also expected to increase, but the Shanghai market has been relatively sluggish in recent days and has not been able to follow the price increase. Therefore, the dealers are not willing to sell at a loss and are holding firm. Currently, the opening price for superior quality is 36 yuan, followed by 31 yuan to 27 or 28 yuan, and the ordinary grade is 19 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e177">Yarn Flowers This Month, Yarn and Spot Prices are Equalized Buyer Interest Suddenly Decreases - Most Have Started Swapping - <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is weakening, and the situation is soft. The reason is that the price of November yarn has been equalized with the spot yarn price, and those going long are less interested. A certain factory has 4,000 bales of open interest, and most of them probably have yarn to deliver, so the November contract alone fell. However, most of the bulls abandoned January and switched to December and January contracts, indicating that the bulls have no intention of taking delivery. Also, today is the anniversary of the Premier's birthday, and the market is closed for one day.</p>
<p>Many Sell Marked Yarn When Prices are High</p>
<p>The marked yarn market opened. Due to the bulls swapping positions in the current month, the momentum weakened. However, the December 1st date is relatively tight, but some are taking the approach of selling on rallies because the price has reached a high level. It is found that most of the bulls are still tightening their positions because their inventory is not high and they do not want to give up, so the power of consolidation is very strong. As a result, the marked yarn for the current month closed lower than the previous day by 16 jiao, and the distant month fell 4.5 jiao. When the market opened in the afternoon, the market condition for the current month was very weak. Because the yarn factory strike is not difficult to resolve, the bulls began to swap positions, and the market situation worsened, breaking the 30-yuan mark. The distant month dragged down the decline. As a result, the current month contract fell another 1.3 yuan from the morning closing price, and the distant month fell 5.6 jiao to 1 yuan. It is found that 2,100 bales of Mingde were sold, 1,900 bales of Zhenda, 10,000 bales of Changyu, 1,650 bales of Yihe, 3,100 bales of Runkang, 1,800 bales of Dachang, 1,750 bales of Yuda, 1,050 bales of Gengfeng, 2,250 bales of Dachangcheng, and 1,150 bales of Changfeng. 2,250 bales were bought by Hexing, 2,500 bales by Ruida, 1,300 bales by Shenji, 2,950 bales by Taichang, 2,650 bales by Yichang, 1,350 bales by Tongfeng, and 950 bales by Changji. The highest and lowest market prices for the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales Feel Good</p>
<p>It is found that various gangs bought a total of 1,215 bales throughout the day, and the selling price was average. The thread price rose by 2 yuan. The amount bought by each gang is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e178">Labor Strike Can Be Resolved Cotton Market Resists Shorts Strongly <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market rebounded. Because it had fallen for days, it prompted profit-takers to cover, so the market tightened and the market rebounded. However, British cotton production increased and the market was weak. Some still shorted on rallies.</p>
<p>Marked Cotton Reacts and Rises</p>
<p>The marked cotton market opened. The near month was still weak because American cotton fell all the way and people were not encouraged. However, the far-term prices rose because profit-takers covered. The market turned up after the second trading session. However, there was crowding from various sources. As a result, each month rose 2.5 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. When the market opened in the afternoon, it was expected that the yarn factory strike could be resolved soon and the market turned bullish. Short covering activity increased and the market fought back. As a result, the near month rose another 5 fen to 2 jiao compared to the morning closing price, and the far month was flat. It is found that 7,800 dan of Taichang were sold, 7,500 dan of Changfeng, 5,400 dan of Yikang, 7,600 dan of Yuanyu Chang, 1,200 dan of Yukang, 2,400 dan of Zhenda, 1,200 dan of Tongfeng, 4,500 dan of Xiecheng, 2,800 dan of Jinkang, 1,500 dan of Dachang. 5,400 dan were bought by Tongji, 5,900 dan by Hengyi, 3,800 dan by Yuda, 2,900 dan by Jinchang, 4,200 dan by Hexing, 2,100 dan by Gengfeng, 5,600 dan by Fengtai, 3,400 dan by Wang Taixing, 3,100 dan by Yongda, 4,200 dan by Mingde, 2,500 dan by Renfeng, and 2,300 dan by Changhe. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Mill Offices Are Still Clear</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is normal. Mill needs are not lacking. There are 1,050 bales of Yaohua and 950 bales of Tonghua from various sources.</p>
<h3 id="e179">American and British Cotton Markets Both Weak <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened, and the market was weak. Each month fell 10 to 13 points. There were not many transactions. Prices fell due to poor news from Liverpool, domestic and foreign bulls liquidated, and cotton farmers hedged. Except for limit-down buying, there was a lack of demand and prices fell. The near term was stable, and the distant term had hedging. The spot cotton base was firm, and the cloth market was active and strong. Fellow traders were watching the domestic publication and exports. It is said that a large cooperative has advised its trustees to sell, which has gradually weakened market sentiment. Before the close, bulls liquidated and hedging started again, and market prices weakened further. It is estimated that spot prices fell 10 points, and futures fell 10 to 15 points. British spot cotton fell 15 points, and futures fell 12 points. Indian cotton rose because of reports of rain and European exporters buying Oomra. Bull liquidation was offset by short covering. It is estimated that Pinggor fell 0.75 to 1.5 rupees, Oomra fell 1 rupee, and White Karachi fell 1.5 rupees. The original telegram is on the left. (10th telegram)</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Mumbai, the opening forecast for the 11th is White Karachi at 217.5 rupees, down 0.75 rupees, Oomra at 196.5 rupees, down 1.25 rupees, and Pinggor at 157.5 rupees, down 0.75 rupees.</p>

<p>Osaka telegram on the 11th, the three grades of futures yarn rose 2 jiao to 2.1 yuan, the near month was 231.9 yuan, and the distant month was 208.9 yuan. Cotton futures fell 5 fen to 2 jiao, the near month was 65.55 yuan, and the distant month was 65.85 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Piece Goods Spot Cotton Cloth Gradually Feels Scarce <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trend of the cloth market was still good. Although domestic and foreign cotton markets have declined unanimously in recent days, the spot yarn sales are strong and prices are firm, the thread price has risen by more than 7 or 8 yuan, the strike wave in yarn factories has gradually expanded, and cotton cloth has risen due to the spot shortage. Yesterday, Dong goods fine twill rose another 5 fen to 1 jiao per piece, and fine twill and fine cloth from this factory also rose (about 2 jiao per piece). However, printed straight tribute, crepe, satin, printed flannel and other goods are sold the most lightly, and the selling market is difficult to revive. The selling market of Shilin cloth and colored twill followed the rise of grey cloth, but it is also difficult to keep pace with white goods because sales are not smooth. Customer sales are only good for the Yangtze River gang. The demand in other sales areas is weak. Because the market price has entered a high level, the selling price in various places is not good, and actual sales have shrunk. Yesterday, the Hankou and Changsha gangs had a very strong demand, and handled more than 300 pieces of fine cloth, fine twill, straight tribute thread, woolen cloth, coarse cloth, flannel and other goods.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Grains Foreign Wheat Plunges Long Position Flour Bulls Emerge Frequently Non-industry Speculators Also Wait and See Result: A Uniform Drop of Two to Three Fen <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market had strong selling pressure and seemed to be trending downstream. Foreign wheat prices, from Chicago and Canada, each fell by a little over 1 jiao to a little over 3 jiao. Liverpool fell by three-quarters. In general, people are hopeful that foreign wheat prices will approach. Speculative bulls emerged one after another, and non-industry speculative stomachs waited and did not advance. Therefore, after the morning closing, the market went downstream step by step, and near and far months fell by as much as 3 to 4 fen. However, spot sales are still worthy of maintenance, and there is still a gap between the price of foreign wheat, so customers take the opportunity to buy, and the intention to buy is even more intense. By the afternoon closing, the situation had stabilized. If foreign wheat prices are calm in the future, the market may be able to maintain support for the time being.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Spot Goods Outlets Stall Futures Wheat Selling Vigorously <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market saw an even sharper decline. After the market opened in the morning, foreign wheat prices were uniformly lower, and spot wheat outlets stalled. People were generally weak. Long position holders gave up, and new short trading was also active. For a time, selling pressure was vigorous, and the market opened and fell step by step. By the time of the close, the decline had slowed slightly as flour prices turned steady. As a result, near and far months fell by 5, 6, 7, and 8 fen compared to the previous day. Spot wheat, due to dwindling stocks, sellers are unwilling to let go, and factories are trying to make repairs, so the situation remains strained, and no transactions have yet occurred.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Customer Xian Rice Market Still Has No Good Signs <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was still a strong arrival of customer Xian rice, and the market still lacked good signs. However, customer sales are still active and the market is still able to support itself. Only the prices of goods below Zhongguan have a tendency to level off. Brown rice is still being actively handled by the Guangdong merchants and is relatively strong. It is estimated that 4,500 bags of Zhejiang, Hubei and Changsha brown rice were handled. The Guangdong merchants' demand for machine rice is very slack, except for rice, only 400 bags of broken rice were handled. Henan handled 600 bags of early machine rice. Xiamen handled 233 bags of machine oil. This merchant handled more than 2,000 bags of Xiang, Gan, and Taiwan machine broken rice. The market conditions are similar to the previous market.</p>
<h3 id="e185">River Rice Floods in Market Prices Ultimately Difficult to Recover <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, a total of fifty or sixty merchant sources arrived, with more than 12,000 shi of goods in total. The sales market on this street feels even more sluggish. And the Qingdao and Yantai gangs continued to handle five or six thousand bags of Bo Dao and more than four hundred bags of thick new Japonica. However, its market conditions are difficult to maintain due to the large number of arrivals. As a result, the market price of thick and thin rice each fell by one jiao, and the supply and demand of Duyang Jian and Yin Bianyuan are similar, without honor or disgrace.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, thirty-two merchant sources arrived from the river, and the market demand was flat. The price of new Japonica was short by five or six fen, Bo Dao was short by another seven or eight fen, the price of Yang Du Bu Jian was short by three or four fen, and the price of Yin Bianyuan stood still. The customer's Jian demand was not good, and the price was flat and sluggish. Also, today is the Premier's birthday, and both the North and South rice markets are closed for one day to commemorate it.</p>

<p>The oil and soybean cake market has a correlative relationship, so when one rises, they all rise. Recently, the oil and soybean cake sales market has been active, and the Dalian market has continued to rise, causing the market sentiment to tighten uniformly. Yesterday, soybean cake was opened for 15,000 pieces of Dachang factory's spot and futures four-brand cake. Although the market price did not move, the factory's products are in high demand, and the selling price must be lower than other factories by two. According to yesterday's market, the factories tightened their positions and did not open, so the future market situation is expected to continue to rise. Soybean oil and raw oil rose another 2 jiao. The factory handled five carts of Che beans and two carts of Sipingjie beans. Other merchants handled eighty bags of Late soybeans and fifty bags of Shayellow. The market price rose by one or two jiao.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Paraffin Wax Industry Association held an evaluation meeting at 10 am yesterday. More than ten representatives, including He Yinsheng and Fan Zonglin, attended. Mr. He was elected chairman. After the formalities, the chairman reported that the selling price should not change. After public decision, the selling price of each product is as follows: "Mingzhong" 22.2 yuan per load, "Zhongjing" 21.8 yuan per load, "Macheng" 20.02 yuan per Shanghai load, "Yakou" 124 yuan, "Mixin" 122 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e188">A Comprehensive View of New Paraffin Oil <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>The paraffin oil production areas are currently harvesting and pressing oil. Although the yields vary between regions, it is estimated that about 60-70% can be harvested. It is reported that Jingzhou, Yichang, and Zhiguo in western Hubei, Macheng in northern Hubei, and Jinshi in western Hunan all have more than 70%, while Jinlan, Wen, and Tai in Zhejiang are also between 60-70%. Only northern Anhui and southern Jiangxi are about 50% or slightly stronger. Only the old source areas of western Zhejiang, such as Chongde and Tongxiang, are the most soft, probably only a little less than 20-30%, and the production is not large, so there are more inferior grades and fewer superior grades. If calculated by the entire country, there are more superior grades and fewer inferior grades. The inventories in various places are not strong, but only thin. The Heben oil in western Zhejiang has 7-8,000 pieces of old goods. With so much inventory when new goods are about to be produced, this is unprecedented in the past ten years. Shanghai is close to it, and every time new goods are first produced, Heben is used as new goods to report because new oil from distant places arrives late, so Heben sales to Shanghai are the most unique during the first batch of new goods. Every year around the winter solstice, the oil workshops come to Shanghai to sell futures oil, and they can always be seen on the road. Now, due to the poor yield this year and high seed prices, it has been collected to about 6.5 yuan per stone, and the cost must be more than 20 yuan. Even the oil workshops dare not pre-sell, and considering the prices in various places, Heben oil is considered the most expensive. Those who handle it cannot calculate it, so they all intend to wait and see. It is speculated that the oil workshops will only sell a small number of new oil when it reaches 20 yuan, but the local merchants in this city are unwilling to accept it based on the price of Han oil, and it must be separated by one yuan. Because of this, the buying and selling parties have not been able to approach, resulting in a silent market.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the wind of rising prices for overseas raw silk was too strong, and New York was even more firm. After examining the reasons, according to those familiar with foreign situations, it is because US President Roosevelt was re-elected, and all industries are expected to recover. At the same time, the inventory of raw silk in New York is decreasing day by day, and the delivery of goods is still on the way, resulting in a temporary shortage of spot goods. In addition, the recent surge in Japanese silk is extremely continuous, which has prompted New York speculators to cover their shorts. Due to these factors, silk prices have risen day by day. It is estimated that yesterday, spot prices in Yokohama rose by 10 yuan, futures rose by 7 yuan, Japanese silk in New York rose by 1-2 points, Shanghai silk maintained the original price, Guangdong silk rose by 1 point, and exchange market prices rose by half a point to one point for near and far months. In Lyon, except for Shanghai silk A, which did not move, the rest of the silk products each rose by one franc. There was no lack of transactions in the local silk market. Jardine Matheson, Wing On and others still had strong demand. Unfortunately, various Western merchants closed for half a day due to horse racing, so silk transactions were slightly less. The total transaction volume for the day was 197 bales.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the market conditions for foreign green tea were still sluggish due to the horse racing season. Only Xiehe and Huacha and other stores in the city bought a total of more than a hundred boxes of Zhenmei green tea, including fine core-extracted and ordinary varieties. The price of Tunxi high-grade goods opened at 85 yuan, and the price of ordinary-grade goods opened at 50-54 yuan, with little change from before. Among them, the Fine Show Mei is in continued demand from abroad, but the inventory in the market has been exhausted and the supply falls short of demand. The remaining goods are trending towards a firm rise.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was still sluggish and there were few transactions. The association’s market price was: 24 coarse sand white spot price was 21.6 yuan, transshipment goods were 5 fen less, and the transaction price was 6 yuan. The spot and transshipment goods of Quanbai No. 489 all maintained the original price. The Dahua No. 1 of the this factory's cotton white was 20.05 yuan, and the remaining goods were returned. There were few transactions at the reported price. Only dozens of bags of Hainan also were sold, at 14.2 yuan, down 3 jiao. Also, 67 bags of Ban Nan Zhou were sold at 13.4 yuan.</p>
<p>The joint company held its second tender for Cantonese sugar this week, with a total quota of 6,067 bags. The bid price was as before. Shun Tak Factory's Five Rams coarse white, 1,030 bags, were sold for 21.3 yuan, Shixin Factory also sold 160 bags for 21.1 yuan, Shantou also sold 10 bags for 20.9 yuan, and Shizhong sand white 190 bags were sold for 19.3 yuan, for a total transaction of 1,390 bags.</p>

<p>Since the overseas price of pig lead has risen sharply, the local market has also risen accordingly.

The increase in the price of raw materials has greatly affected the finished products, so manufacturers are trying to collect scrap lead and mixed lead (because they are cheap, only about 20 yuan), and they dare not purchase genuine pig lead. It is found that in addition to a few transactions in the market, bulk buying and selling is sluggish. In addition, Hunan local lead is also sold for about 26 yuan per dan.</p>

<p>— Yunbo</p>
<p>During the Ming Dynasty, the Wokou pirates were extremely rampant, relying on their power to act unscrupulously, invading and harassing the coastal areas of our country. The provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang suffered the most severely. Consequently, many heroes who resisted the Wokou emerged, leaving behind many earth-shattering and moving historical events. People like Qi Jiguang and Yu Dayou became famous because of this. Hou Duan was also a hero of that time, but probably not many people know this name.</p>
<p>Hou Duan was a brave general from Jinshan County, Jiangsu Province. He practiced martial arts from a young age, so his skills were superb. It would be impossible for several hundred ordinary people to move him, let alone get close to him. He could truly be called a hero who could uproot mountains and carry tripods, a brave man with bronze muscles and iron bones.</p>
<p>One day, he was chatting with people in front of the yamen (government office) when someone said, "The warriors of ancient times always said they had the strength of a thousand jun (ancient unit of weight, approximately 30 pounds) in both arms. I wonder if that's true." Another person then said to him, "Brother Hou, we know you're strong, but we don't know exactly how much strength you have." Hou Duan, upon hearing this, looked at the stone lion weighing a thousand jin in front of the yamen and said, "I wonder if I can lift this stone lion." After saying this, he stood up, walked to the stone lion, bent down, and hugged the stone lion with both hands. First, he shook it a bit, then he straightened his body, and the stone lion left the ground and rested in his arms. He even carried it around the yard for a circle before putting it back in its original place. His face wasn't red, he wasn't panting, and he smiled as he asked, "How about that?" At this point, the onlookers were already dumbfounded. Their tongues were stuck out and couldn't retract; they couldn't even speak.</p>
<p>On one occasion, Hou Duan was riding a horse on the road. As he looked at the green mountains and clear waters, he couldn't help but think to himself, "Time passes quickly, but I haven't accomplished anything yet. If I continue like this, wouldn't I be wasting my bronze muscles and iron bones? I've been idle for many years; I wonder if my muscles and bones have weakened recently?" At this moment, he was passing under a stone memorial arch. He stretched out both hands, grabbed the horizontal beam at the top, and used his legs to squeeze the horse, exerting force upwards. This lifted both man and horse into the air, hanging there as if suspended, performing three "hangings." After a good while, he finally loosened his hands, allowing the horse's hooves to touch the ground, and then nonchalantly urged his horse on and rode away.</p>
<p>From somewhere, a white-browed tiger had appeared in the neighboring county of Nanhui, frequently coming out to harm people and livestock, frightening the local residents so much that they didn't dare leave their homes for days. Although the government had offered a reward for someone to capture it, several hunters who went to claim the reward were injured by the tiger, making its reputation even more fearsome. The people of that place were restless, unable to eat or sleep, and worried day and night. When this news reached Hou Duan's ears, he volunteered to go and kill the tiger, taking his sword with him. After a fierce battle, he killed the violent tiger, eliminating a major threat to the local area.</p>
<p>Although Hou Duan was so brave, he didn't have the opportunity to perform great deeds because no one recognized his abilities. He was just a garrison officer in Jinshan County.</p>
<p>At this time, the Wokou pirates happened to invade Jinshan again, bringing thirteen pirate ships and leading tens of thousands of men, with great momentum, surging towards the south of Jinshan city. When the scouts received this news, they immediately reported it to the county government. The officials in the government were all terrified of the Wokou pirates. Upon hearing this news, they were already out of their minds and didn't know what to do. They couldn't think of any way to protect the people, let alone muster the courage to resist. They were only concerned with their own lives and families, and fled one after another.</p>
<p>Hou Duan, being a righteous man, knew that defending the city and resisting the enemy was his duty and didn't want to escape. Moreover, this was a good opportunity for him to show his skills and establish his reputation, so how could he give it up? However, he was just a minor general with only a few hundred soldiers under his command, so his strength was very weak. The Wokou pirates, on the other hand, had a large force and great momentum. Furthermore, they were attacking with courage, making them unstoppable. The situation at the time was that the numbers were unequal, but he wasn't afraid at all. He led his troops out of the city to resist the enemy, stationing them in Yangjia Tuan, outside the east gate. He also moved the residents' food and supplies outside the city.</p>
<p>Just as they were preparing, the Wokou pirates' ships arrived. Hou Duan hurriedly rode his horse to the seawall to observe the situation of the Wokou pirates. At that time, the tide was receding, and the water near the shore was very shallow, so the Wokou pirates' large ships couldn't sail in and were anchored about a li (approximately one-third of a mile) away from the shore. They were launching small boats, preparing to transport troops to the shore. A pirate general dressed in red led the way, commanding the small boats, linking them together in a line, heading straight towards the shore.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this, Hou Duan turned his horse into the water and rode towards the small boats. After riding for a while, the water gradually became deeper, and the horse's belly strap was blocking the water, making it difficult for him to move forward. Hou Duan then jumped off his horse, drew his knife, and cut the belly strap, dropping it into the water. He jumped back onto his horse and continued forward. When he was about a hundred paces away from the small boats, he reined in his horse, drew his bow, and aimed an arrow at the red-clad pirate general. The red-clad pirate general was giving commands and was caught off guard. The arrow pierced his throat, and he fell to the ground. The Wokou pirates were shocked to see their commander suddenly fall to the ground, and their formation became disorganized. Everyone hurriedly turned their boats back and gathered around the large ships. After a while, they saw that Hou Duan was alone, so they added more troops and charged towards the shore again. Unable to resist them alone, he turned his horse back. On the way, he encountered a shepherd. Fearing that the Wokou pirates would chase after him because of his white horse, he borrowed a sheep from the shepherd and killed it, smearing the sheep's blood on the horse's body, turning the white horse into a red horse. This allowed him to safely return to Yangjia Tuan.</p>
<p>The Wokou pirates' purpose in invading was to plunder. Now that they had landed, they would naturally seize men to serve and work for them, seize women to satisfy their lust, and plunder property, preparing to return home fully loaded. They acted unscrupulously along the way, committing many atrocities of burning and slaughter, and performing various brutal and cruel acts. This forced the residents along the coast, especially those who were wealthy, to flee at the first sign of trouble. Those who remained to be slaughtered were just the poor. How could the Wokou pirates' desire for plunder be satisfied? They knew very well that cities were more prosperous places, with more people, thriving industry and commerce, and more comfortable daily necessities than in the countryside. Moreover, the granaries and treasuries were definitely full of food and wealth. Their focus for plunder was naturally still on the cities. If the cities were heavily guarded, they would still risk their lives to attack. Now that Jinshan city was offering no resistance, they would naturally occupy it without hesitation.</p>
<p>After the Wokou pirates occupied the city, most of their elite troops all went ashore, leaving only the old, weak, and disabled soldiers on the ships. They assumed that the soldiers were afraid and wouldn't dare to resist, so they only cared about raping, looting, and enjoying themselves temporarily, without any plans for defense or occupation. Hou Duan saw this weakness of the Wokou pirates and took advantage of their carelessness to lead his soldiers in a sneak attack on the pirate ships at night. He ordered the soldiers to bring sulfur, kerosene, firewood, torches, etc., to set the ships on fire when they got close. In an instant, the wind added to the fire's power, setting all the ships, large and small, ablaze. A red light illuminated the area as if it were daytime, turning the river's surface blood red. The soldiers guarding the ships either died in the fire or drowned in the water. Those who managed to escape to shore were killed by swords and knives. None of them escaped. By the time the Wokou pirates in the city received the news and came to put out the fire, the ships had already turned to ashes. From then on, the Wokou pirates were cut off from their return route and lost their reinforcements, leaving them in a difficult situation. They could only desperately defend the empty city, stationing a team outside the west gate to act as reinforcements, but when they came out of the east gate, their power was greatly diminished.</p>
<p>Seeing the Wokou pirates' weakened state, Hou Duan wanted to take the opportunity to wipe them out. He reasoned that if he allowed them to continue occupying the city, he would be failing in his duty to defend the country's territory. Moreover, if the Wokou pirates' reinforcements arrived, they would become even more ferocious and difficult to control. Therefore, he immediately led his soldiers to attack the city. He himself rode a white horse, wielding two swords, and rode along the city walls. He went to the south gate and saw that it was closed, so he couldn't do anything. He then rode his horse towards the west gate. The west gate was open, but the drawbridge over the moat had been destroyed. He was about to lead his troops across the river to attack when he looked back and saw that his soldiers had been left far behind when he rode his horse. However, a group of Wokou pirates stationed outside the west gate had already surrounded him, trying to capture him. He thought, "Enough, at this point, what am I afraid of? But simply fighting them is not worth it. As the saying goes, 'To catch bandits, first catch the leader,' and 'If you don't enter the tiger's den, how can you catch the tiger cubs?' I might as well rush into the city alone, kill them to my heart's content, and then rush back out of the east gate, which is closer." After thinking this, he backed his horse up a few steps, patted its head, and shouted, "Horse! Horse! You must try your best to jump over the river! Otherwise, you and I will both die!" The horse was truly clever, as if it understood his words. It jumped over the river. He was overjoyed and full of energy. He shouted loudly and charged straight into the city.</p>
<p>The Wokou soldiers in the city tried to capture him, but he slaughtered them like cutting melons and vegetables. Anyone who was grazed by his sword was wounded, and anyone who touched the blade fell to the ground. They couldn't stop him. Although Hou Duan was alone, surrounded by enemies, he charged left and right, as if he were in an empty place. However, there were too many Wokou pirates, and he couldn't drive them back. From morning until noon, the fighting continued without end. He felt hungry and tired, and he had suffered many injuries, so he didn't dare to linger. He had to cut a bloody path and flee towards the east gate.</p>
<p>Seeing that they couldn't stop him, the Wokou pirates came up with a clever plan. They used a whole bolt of coarse cloth, with dozens of people pulling on each end, and stretched it across the road, hoping to trip Hou Duan's horse. Hou Duan used his left-hand sword to lift the cloth and his right-hand sword to cut it, charging through. When he reached the east gate, he cut through the gate and rushed out. Unexpectedly, a team of soldiers with hooks was lying in ambush beside the gate, hooking him with long hooks. One of his arms was hooked. The Wokou pirates, seeing that they had hooked him, used all their strength to pull. Fortunately, Hou Duan was strong and couldn't be pulled. He struggled with all his might, tearing apart four pieces of his armor, broke free from the hook, and rode back, covered in blood.</p>
<p>He had charged into the city alone and killed many people. When they spoke of it later, they regarded Hou Duan as a divine general.</p>
<p>After Hou Duan returned to his camp after this great battle, he realized that one person's bravery couldn't wipe out the Wokou pirates. He gathered the remaining soldiers, trained the people, expanded the team, and prepared weapons and food. At the same time, he worked hard to train them, advocating the true meaning of saving the country and resisting the enemy. After his long-term training, his army became strong and powerful, completely different from before. Knowing that the time was ripe, he re-swore to lead the army to eliminate the Wokou pirates and launched a major attack on the city, easily defeating and killing the Wokou pirates. Those who scattered and fled were also killed or captured alive by the people in the surrounding villages. In the end, he completely annihilated the Wokou pirates.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Samuel Finley Breese Morse (1791-1872) <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Li Weiyi</p>
<p>-Inventor of the Telegraph-</p>
<p>Morse was a scientist and artist, born in Charleston, Massachusetts, USA on April 27, 1791. His father was a pastor. Morse entered Yale College at the age of fourteen. Under the tutelage of professors Day and Silliman, he developed a great interest in electricity, and as a result, he became famous in this field.</p>
<p>In his early years, he liked art more than science. Therefore, he studied with Washington Allston, one of the most famous artists in the United States at the time, and lived in England with him for four years. His achievements during this period were great. He returned to the United States in 1815, hoping that the government would appoint him to the task of writing history books, but he was unsuccessful. He only managed to get a job in Charleston doing portraits. Later, he went to New York and settled there. In 1825, he laid the foundation for the National Academy of Design in the United States and was elected as its first president. By 1827, his interest in electricity was revived. At this time, he studied electromagnetism with Professor J.F. Dana at Columbia College. However, his interest in art remained strong, and in 1829 he went to Europe again to study with his former teachers.</p>
<p>The year he returned to his country, 1832, can be said to be the time when he ended his artistic pursuits and began to concentrate on scientific research. On the deck of the ship returning home, one day he and several passengers were discussing electromagnetism. He suddenly seemed to have an inspiration and said: "If electricity can exist in any part of a wire, I believe that there is no message that cannot be transmitted through it."</p>
<p>From then on, he worked hard to study, and soon proved that electric current can travel along a wire to any distant place in an instant; and knew that if the line was broken, sparks would come out. He also discovered that sparks could represent part of a language, either letters or numbers; the disappearance of sparks could also represent another part of the language; if the existence or disappearance of sparks was prolonged, it could represent some other words; so letters could be easily created, and single words could also be expressed. After several days of work, he drew a rough draft of the necessary machine and showed it to the people on his ship.</p>
<p>Then, Morse worked hard in poverty for several years before completing his invention. First, in 1835, he invented the "relay" that he had long wanted to supplement, so that the current that had weakened after passing through a long distance in the wire could be restored again. In 1836, he completed a working telegraph machine. On September 2, 1837, in his room at New York University, he took out his machine for several friends to see, and installed 1,700 feet of copper wire here. The result of the experiment was very satisfactory, and it stimulated the interest of several brothers named Vail, copper and iron craftsmen from New Jersey, in studying electricity. From then on, they often interacted with Morse in practical applications.</p>
<p>Morse requested the government to give him a patent, which was approved on September 28, 1837. Soon after, he petitioned Congress to allocate a subsidy to him to cover the cost of purchasing materials, so that the telegraph could be applied in practice. The petition was accepted by the Commerce Committee, which gave him a good word in its report to Congress, but Congress delayed the matter and did not allocate the subsidy to him. So he ran to various European countries to seek patent rights, but did not succeed in any way. In England, his request was rejected; France granted him a patent and gave him some subsidies, but the amount was too small to be useful. Russia thought his invention was useless and did not allow him to use it. A year later, he had to return to New York.</p>
<p>It was not until February 23, 1843, that Congress passed his long-shelved petition and gave him a subsidy of $30,000. He set up a telegraph between Baltimore and Washington. In May of the following year, the two places communicated for the first time, and the results were very good. Morse was very happy and unconsciously sent out this sentence: "What Hath God Wrought!"</p>
<p>Morse and several of his former colleagues who had worked together on the research obtained patent rights and soon organized a company to lay telegraph lines all over the United States. From then on, his career developed day by day and received praise from governments and people all over the world. Austria, Belgium, France, Russia, Turkey, Sweden, the Netherlands (now the Netherlands) and several other small countries sent representatives to give him bonuses because of the convenience and widespread use of the telegraph in their countries, collecting a total of 400,000 francs.</p>
<p>Morse not only had immortal success in telegraphy, but also befriended Mr. Daguerre in Paris and studied photography with him, achieving considerable success. He was the first person in the United States to use silver plate photography (photography that coats silver salts on copper plates). He also invented submarine cables. He died in New York on April 2, 1872, but his career is immortal.</p>

<h3 id="e196">The Current Situation of the Chinese Publishing Industry and the Path it Should Take in the Future <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Dachuan</p>
<p>The rise and fall of a country's culture is fully reflected in its publishing industry. When we look at the advanced countries of the world, the quantity of their publications can determine the stage of their cultural progress. Countries such as Russia, Germany, Japan, the United States, Britain, and France show this significant phenomenon. Looking back at our own China, its cultural backwardness and the scarcity of its publications are truly shameful and leave us with the regret of being far behind. I remember foreigners saying that China's current culture is still that of 18th-century Europe, which makes us even more ashamed.</p>
<p>What is the current situation of the Chinese publishing industry? What kind of culture does it reflect? Talking about these issues really feels vast and boundless, because the scope involved is so large, and the internal situation is so complex that it cannot be fully explained in just a few hundred words, just as the world says, where to start talking about the "Twenty-Two Dynastic Histories"!</p>
<p>When observing the current stage of the Chinese publishing industry, people naturally focus on its actual phenomena as the starting point for their observations and discussions. This article will also be based on this key focus and the surrounding environmental conditions to give a rough description, and briefly discuss my humble opinions on the current causes of the weakness of the Chinese publishing industry and the new path it should take in the future:</p>
<p>(1) The purchasing power of the intellectual class is weak. Due to the current economic panic, both urban and rural areas are in a state of recession. The suffering is even greater among the intellectual class. Due to the pressure of life and the loss of employment, their economic power to purchase publications is gradually weakening. I have investigated many people who like to read very much. Three or four years ago, they could still buy books and newspapers worth dozens of yuan every year, but now they can't even afford books worth a few yuan. Economic pressure has caused them to lack spiritual food. This is certainly the most painful thing for intellectuals, and at the same time, it is a major crisis for the publishing industry.</p>
<p>(2) The content of publications lacks essence. From the perspective of the Chinese themselves, there seem to be quite a few publications in China now. On average, there are four or five new books and two or three hundred magazines published every month. Newspapers all over the country are not included in this list. However, looking at their content, there are very few new ideas or refined discussions. This is not an exaggerated statement. In fact, most of the people currently engaged in compiling and publishing publications have empty personal life experiences and shallow knowledge. When they write, they either cut and paste other people's works or plagiarize foreign people's opinions, piecing them together into chapters. The beginning and end are inconsistent, the content is chaotic and scattered, and the writing is dry and obscure. This kind of situation is a common disease among general authors, and those who suffer from it severely will carry the virus into the publishing industry. It is a pity that young readers, like lost sheep, are unknowingly harmed. Therefore, there are still many people who are not optimistic about the new culture and shake their heads when it comes to the current publishing industry, sighing at the decline of culture and the many stillborn publications. The many morbidities of the publications themselves can also stimulate a small part of the demand for readers.</p>
<p>(3) Competing to print ancient books and reprint for profit. There is a special phenomenon in the current publishing industry, that is, the various bookstores in Shanghai, the so-called cultural center of the country, are competing to print ancient books from past dynasties. The times are moving forward, but their publications are mostly turning backward. The louder the call for popularizing education, the more printed materials they specialize in supplying for the appreciation of the leisured class. There are very few systematic reorganizations like the "Historical Series of Internal Turmoil and Foreign Disasters in China" of the Shenzhou Guoguang Society recently. We are not opposed to reprinting ancient books, because this also has its background and the decisions of the current environment. Why not do it when you can revive the inherent culture without paying manuscript fees? There is also a very strong trend of secretly printing and reprinting pirated versions. These trends were not uncommon in Beijing, Tianjin, and Kaifeng nine years ago, but now this trend is still very rampant in Shanghai. This kind of thing certainly violates the publishing law and harms the interests of authors and their publishers, but because of the low prices of pirated versions, they are very popular among general readers. Even in the case of school textbooks, the number of pirated books is not small. However, the paper is too poor and there are too many typos, which also harms readers. In addition, the rampant printing of various ancient and modern chivalrous and romantic novels, selling them at low prices, and making them popular all over the country and deep into the interior, is the most profitable speculative business in the publishing industry, but it does not do any good for the entire publishing industry, because their goal is to seize money, and they are fundamentally indifferent to the evolution of culture.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Reading Notes (Continued) <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>The book is divided into eight chapters. The first chapter is an overall discussion, the second is on administrative organizations, the third is on central administrative organizations, the fourth is on local administrative organizations, the fifth is on autonomous administrative organizations, the sixth is on the legal relationship of officials, the seventh is on administrative acts, and the eighth is on administrative remedies. Each chapter is further divided into sections and subsections. For example, regarding various organizations, it explains their meaning, system, classification, characteristics, powers, etc. Each item is then analyzed in detail, with a clear and well-organized presentation. Furthermore, it constantly refers to the country's draft system as a reference, making it easy for people to understand and discuss. It truly achieves a level of simplicity and completeness, making it effortless to read.</p>
<p>Moreover, if we want to deeply understand any kind of system, it is best to compare it with similar systems. The book also pays attention to this point. For example, regarding administrative law, it points out three differences from administrative science in terms of purpose, basis, and conclusion. For delegation and agency, it notes four differences. Officials and public servants also have four points of difference. Regarding disciplinary penalties, it compares them with criminal punishments and lists seven differences in terms of basis, object, cause, purpose, effectiveness, executing agency, and scope of discretion for explanation. Regarding administrative regulations, it points out several differences from administrative orders. Regarding the distinction between appeals and petitions, it points out three differences. The difference between administrative litigation and civil litigation also has three differences. All of these involve repeated comparisons to make understanding more thorough.</p>
<p>In addition, the book lists the theories of various schools for each legal system, but it is not broad and without a guiding principle. For example, regarding the distinction between public law and private law, there are theories of relationship, theories of law, theories of interest, etc., and finally, it points out that the theory of interest is more complete. The standard for distinguishing between public legal persons and private legal persons includes the theory of purpose and affairs, the theory of state organs, the theory of group power, the theory of state relations, and the theory of personality differences. Finally, it says that the theory of personality differences is appropriate. Regarding whether one should obey an order that conflicts with laws and regulations, it mentions legal, order, and compromise theories, and says that the compromise theory is appropriate. Therefore, although we see a list of various theories, which may be bewildering, it does not lead to the suffering of "not knowing what to do." Moreover, the judgments made on each theory in the book allow us to generate the effect of mutual learning and discussion based on different viewpoints and research.</p>
<p>These are all the strengths of this book. It is published by Shanghai Hanwen Zhengkai Printing Bureau and is priced at one yuan.</p>
<p>At the same time, we also have an incidental feeling, which is that the value of this book is relatively long-lasting. Although administrative laws and regulations are constantly being revised, added to, and deleted, the sources of administrative law are nothing more than orders, regulations, and other items. Therefore, to study administrative law, it is necessary to continuously collect information on administration for reference and to make research practically suitable. This book can serve as basic reading material. Complete</p>
<h3 id="e198">"How to Study Philosophy" <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Yilin</p>
<p>Written by Wang Te-fu, published by Jiang Bookstore</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>Recently, several introductory books on philosophy have been published. In my opinion, only two are worth noting. One is Ai Siqi's "Popular Philosophy," which is a popular philosophy book in a conversational style, suitable for the general public to read—as its name suggests. The other is Wang Te-fu's "How to Study Philosophy," which will be discussed here. This is a very excellent philosophy book; although it is presented as an "introductory book," it is actually more than just an excellent introductory book. People who have never known the content of the discipline of "philosophy" can not only clearly understand what problems "philosophy" contains or how these problems are related by reading this book, but it can even tell you where these problems lead to. This is something that people who have confusedly read hundreds of philosophy books may not be able to answer.</p>
<p>This book is divided into nine chapters, each divided into three or two sections. Chapter 1, "What is the Nature of Philosophy?", Chapter 2, "Why Should We Study Philosophy?", and Chapter 3, "The Positive and Empirical Methods in Philosophical Research" are the first part of the book and can be regarded as a general overview. Chapter 4, "How to Conduct Analytical Research", Chapter 5, "How to Conduct Synthetic Research", Chapter 6, "How to Conduct Critical Research", and Chapter 7, "The Steps to Take in Research" are the second part of the book and can be regarded as the "main discussion." Chapter 8, "Outline of Philosophy (I) - An Overview of the Contents of Philosophy," and Chapter 9, "Outline of Philosophy (II) - An Overview of the History of the Development of Philosophy" provide a cross-sectional and longitudinal explanation of philosophy. The above is the outline of the whole book. The author will not hesitate to be tedious, select and restate its internal content, and then discuss its main characteristics and value.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>It is necessary to make a brief summary of the content of the whole book, whether in introducing a book or criticizing a book. What follows is the main content of the entire book "How to Study Philosophy." As for the method of summary, it is to extract the key points by chapter and state the central meaning of each chapter.</p>
<p>1. What is Philosophy: Philosophy is a department of science and is qualified to be called science, because what is called science is the objective things and the laws of their movement, which are reflected and transformed into a systematically organized system of knowledge of human thinking; and philosophy as a discipline is to systematize the general and fundamental principles of nature, society and its relationship with human thinking, making it a comprehensive, organized and systematic knowledge. In other words, it is the same in using these laws to restate the relationship between objective existence, thinking, and existence, thereby discussing the most general and most fundamental laws of all existence, forming its own knowledge system and becoming a regular discipline; from this, it can be seen that philosophy is indeed a rigorous science. Specifically speaking, when the overall universe is the subject of research, it is the object dealt with by natural philosophy or cosmology philosophy; when the overall society is the subject of research, it is the object dealt with by social philosophy; when human thinking and its relationship with general existence are the subject matter, it is the object dealt with by the pure thinking philosophy's theory of knowledge and methodology. This is also the type of philosophy that is distinguished by the realistic object of research. In short, when philosophy discusses existence, thinking, and even their interrelationships, it comprehensively studies the most general and fundamental laws of motion in the universe, the highest peak of science, which is the science of condensed matter of the entire theory of scientific theory and method. From a methodological point of view, it can be said to be the "algebra of science."</p>
<p>2. Why Study Philosophy: The study of philosophy is necessary both to understand the universe, society, and life, and to practice. Our study of philosophy lies in being able to form a system of thought of a worldview, a social view, and a view of life for ourselves, and to obtain the correct worldview, social view, and view of life to guide our actions. Demand is caused by the actual life of mankind, and in order to continue living, we must have a correct philosophical system of thought as a guide for progress—everything new is to be. Creation guided by a correct worldview and outlook on life.</p>

<h3 id="e199">The Prerequisite for Treating Infertility <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>... There will be no birth of healthy and lovely children without a perfect sex life ... Radically curing the sexual performance obstacles of both men and women is the only way to plant the seeds</p>
<p>We cannot deny that, privately, children are the heirs of the family; in terms of public convention, children are also candidates for society. Therefore, giving birth to healthy children is the natural duty of citizens. Modern people have sharper eyes, so most of them can understand that suffering from infertility is a disgrace to mankind and a loss to the country. It is no wonder that the major European and American powers actively encourage childbirth and use the omnipotence of science to save the misery of infertile people.</p>
<p>To enable every man and woman to give birth, and to produce healthy children, I would like to contribute some necessary knowledge about pregnancy from a medical perspective.</p>
<p>The function of reproductive organs depends on the prosperity of the gonads. Healthy gonads, in men, make sperm move agilely; in women, egg movement is also very active; so they can meet and complete the conception process. Naturally, this meeting is based on the existence of sexual behavior. Therefore, we know that those with strong gonads and who can live a happy sex life are most likely to have the opportunity to be parents. Based on this principle, we can examine the causes of infertility. Whether in men or women, it actually refers to sexual performance defects.</p>
<p>In men, sexual performance defects are mostly the result of the evils of masturbation, indulgence, and prostitution. From a very young age, the gonads are harmed by masturbation and are hindered. As a result, the ejaculation function is also out of control, and then phenomena such as nocturnal emission and premature ejaculation appear one after another, even turning into impotence, unable to have appropriate sex life, and the sperm moves sluggishly, naturally unable to make women pregnant.</p>
<p>Contracting gonorrhea through prostitution will also damage the sexual nerves, and the result will be the same as above.</p>
<p>In women, irregular menstruation, lack of endocrine in the gonads, sluggish egg movement, excessive vaginal discharge, or contracting gonorrhea due to masturbation or congenital weakness can all cause infertility, making people only able to look up to the sky and sigh in vain.</p>
<p>The remedy is to find ways to restore healthy sexual performance. For men's nocturnal emission, it is appropriate to prescribe "Simit's Sperm-Locking Tablets" to stop nocturnal emission immediately. For premature ejaculation, impotence, and underdevelopment, it is appropriate to prescribe the gonad hormone preparation "Fertility Hormone" to promote the gonadal function so that a fulfilling sex life can be achieved. For women's irregular menstruation and other symptoms, "Female Fertility Hormone" must be prescribed to adjust it. Vaginal discharge is enough to kill sperm, and "Cure Discharge Spirit" must be used to clear it. As for gonorrhea suffered by both men and women, only the combination of internal use of vaccine and flavochrome "Anti-Gonorrhea" can penetrate the membrane and kill bacteria, so that all diseases can be eliminated.</p>
<p>(Editor's Note: The genuine "Fertility Hormone" and "Simit's Sperm-Locking Tablets" are both packed in iron boxes. Recently, unscrupulous merchants in the market, regardless of morality, sell counterfeit drugs in paper boxes and bottles under false pretenses. Customers must specify iron boxes to avoid being deceived.)</p>

<h3 id="e200">Lower Back Pain in Those with Weak Bodies <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Junshi, M.D., Germany</p>
<p>The advent of bone pain is by no means a matter of one morning and evening. The rheumatism and blood toxins accumulated over many years are the real root causes of the disease. This root cause always wages a deadly battle with health, and only when health has shown signs of defeat will it show its face slightly. That is to say: a little too much labor will cause lower back pain, which is the first sound of bone pain defeating health.</p>
<p>If health can support the remaining situation, the development of bone pain will be slower. If health is completely defeated, then the pain in the bones and joints all over the body will occur repeatedly, gradually approaching the dangerous situation of hemiplegia and arteriosclerosis.</p>
<p>Therefore, people who are usually weak in physique, after strenuous operation or indulgence, will feel lower back pain, which indicates that this person's health is in danger of total collapse, and bone pain is developing gradually and progressively.</p>
<p>Not to mention the deepening crisis day by day, even repeated lower back pain is enough to wear down your spirit and ruin your career. Rapid treatment is necessary.</p>
<p>The most important treatment policy is naturally to adopt "Strongston's Bone Pain Tablets" that can penetrate deep into the joints, eliminate dampness and dispel madness, and clarify the blood, so that patients take it internally, like a powerful army, quickly eliminating the disease. This therapy was invented by Dr. Strongston, and the medical community around the world believes that it is the only savior for bone pain.</p>
<p>In addition, didn't I say that bone pain must defeat health before it can appear? Then, improving health and strengthening resistance can prevent its progress before recovery and prevent recurrence after recovery. This should be taking the gonad hormone preparation "Fertility Hormone" to promote the body's strength.</p>
<p>Research on Quitting Smoking</p>
<h3 id="e201">Obtaining a Safe Method of Quitting Smoking <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Bofu, Physician</p>
<p>Tobacco poison is like a big tree. The longer it exists, the deeper the roots penetrate into the mud, with intricate roots, many branches, and it is firmly unremovable. Isn't the existence of tobacco poison like this? The longer the period, the deeper it can penetrate into the various tissues of the body, anesthetizing it. Gradually, the originally lively vitality becomes numb and sluggish, and it can only operate normally under the stimulation of the smoke. Tobacco poison has become the master of life, and smokers are permanently reduced to slaves.</p>
<p>Smokers, think about it, wasn't it you who led the wolf into the house to become slaves? What about now? Secretly smoking, risking being caught and taken to the authorities, occasionally not having time to smoke, the wind makes waves in the body, making you cry and cry, and suffer unbearably, regardless of your busy schedule, regardless of whether you are a guest, and regardless of whether you have money or not, it is the same weirdness. Sucking up your fat and eroding your health. Slaves who live an inhuman life should rise up against such a brutal master.</p>
<p>The most effective and safe method of quitting smoking is to promote the gonad preparation "Fertility Hormone," which can infuse you with new vitality, making the numb and sluggish tissues re-energized. The preparation can move flexibly, break away from the shackles of tobacco poison, naturally see smoke and be disgusted, and no longer want to beg for the spirit of doing things from the smoke. Having nothing to fear, you can make the tobacco poison that erodes life scatter at the sight of the wind. As for the nocturnal emission that is common during the withdrawal period, you can also take "Simit's Sperm-Locking Tablets," which can stop immediately and is an excellent adjuvant medicine.</p>
<p>There was a patient Shen Fulin, 34 years old, who used to be with bad friends and got addicted to smoking, which made his body weaker and weaker, and he was unable to quit. After being treated with "Fertility Hormone," his body improved day by day in just five weeks, and he no longer thought about smoking. Moreover, after a painless process, the muscles after quitting became strong and firm, and his spirit was full of vigor, completely recovering to the state that a normal adult should have.</p>
<p>Sexual Enlightenment</p>
<p>— Physician Zhan Nianzen</p>
<h3 id="e202">Research on the Causes and Harms of Nocturnal Emission <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>... The cause of nocturnal emission is most tragic and widespread due to the harm of masturbation ... Parents should pay attention to babies' fondness for fondling their sexual organs</p>
<p>Masturbation is related to nocturnal emission. I am not saying that people who do not masturbate will not have nocturnal emission. Because young people who do not have the bad habit of masturbation will still have nocturnal emission if they are weak and suffer from many diseases. Conversely, strong young people at the time of physiological maturity will also have one or two nocturnal emissions per month. Therefore, to study the cause of nocturnal emission, if the harmful result is considered, then undoubtedly the one caused by masturbation is the most tragic and numerous.</p>
<p>Masturbation is the most prevalent bad habit when the spring feelings of both sexes are aroused. Initially, spring feelings are caused by the sexual arousal of a certain part of the body. But what are the key points in those places? In women, it is the labia, breasts, and clitoris; in men, it is the glans and urethra; in both sexes, these important organs have peripheral nerves.</p>
<p>Doctors who have studied sexual education extensively generally agree that the bad habit of masturbation has been formed in babies in the cradle. Readers need not doubt that when a baby sleeps in bed, they like to fondle their sexual organs and then fall asleep quickly. Young children continue this method, and after the onset of spring feelings, it becomes the bad habit of masturbation.</p>
<p>Therefore, to thoroughly solve the proliferation of the harm of masturbation, parents who should understand some practical sex education should try to avoid it when they discover that newborn children have the habit of exploring their private parts. If this is done, I think there will be some benefits in reducing bad habits in adulthood!</p>
<p>The most common harm is that young people who masturbate excessively lack good development—small penis and atrophied testicles. Because good development depends entirely on the strength of endocrine. After masturbation, because the spirit is destroyed and relaxed. Therefore, nocturnal emission is inevitable. The unlimited waste of endocrine. Naturally, it will be exhausted. Not only is the development of the sexual organs hindered. As a result of the exhaustion of semen, the gonads are abnormally weak. Impotence and premature ejaculation occur one after another. Such young people have already lost their happiness after marriage at this time. Moreover, they are unable to do things, their spirits are decadent, their brains are slow, and insomnia and forgetfulness are just some of the symptoms of neurasthenia. The harm of masturbation and nocturnal emission is difficult to describe in detail.</p>
<p>Regarding the remedy for the harm, you should first quit masturbation, and then take "Simit's Sperm-Locking Tablets" to consolidate the sperm barrier and stop nocturnal emission, so that nocturnal emission can be completely cured. However, premature ejaculation, impotence, underdevelopment, and neurasthenia caused by nocturnal emission. "Fertility Hormone" must be taken at the same time to fully strengthen the gonads. The effect is like a god.</p>

<p>(1) Impotence Treatment Regains Development</p>
<p>Patient Tang Guorong, 27 years old, lacks strength in sexual life after marriage, and the couple lacks pleasure. (Chief complaint) ... At the age of sixteen, he was induced by bad friends in the school dormitory to perform interactive masturbation. He developed a habit and practiced masturbation once every night, which greatly destroyed his youth. The development of the sexual organs was hindered. The local area is abnormally small, and nocturnal emission is frequent and uninterrupted. Therefore, not only did his grades in school decline. He got married at the age of twenty-four, but after marriage, although he was able to quit his bad habits, all the harms caused by masturbation and nocturnal emission were completely brewing, deeply rooted. Therefore, he suffered from premature ejaculation on the wedding night. But what is most unfortunate is that he cannot continue to have the ability to have a second sexual intercourse, so he has been living in tragedy for several years after marriage. (Current symptoms) ... Sparse pubic hair, prostate, and gonads have all been destroyed by bad habits and are completely in a state of weakness. (Treatment method) ... Diagnosed Tang Jun's root cause is the weakness of the gonads and the relaxation of the sperm barrier, so in addition to performing electrotherapy every day, take the gonad hormone preparation "Fertility Hormone" to enhance the ability of the gonads, improve the development of sexual organs, and enhance sexual performance. At the same time, use "Simit's Sperm-Locking Tablets" to consolidate its sperm barrier and stop its nocturnal emission. In less than two months, Tang Jun's sexual organs increased by a quarter, and impotence, premature ejaculation, and nocturnal emission have completely disappeared.</p>
<p>(2) Masturbation, Early Marriage, Phimosis, Infertility</p>
<p>Patient Xu Shengming, 29 years old, from Liyang, Jiangsu. (Chief complaint) ... He had the bad habit of masturbation at the age of fifteen, and got married at the age of nineteen. Moreover, he had excessive sexual life after marriage, and his sexual nerves were abnormally weak, so nocturnal emission has never stopped. Moreover, the sexual organs are underdeveloped, not only small but also phimosis. When urinating, the urine first enters the foreskin, and then is discharged from the foreskin. It is the same when ejaculating, which is extremely unpleasant. (Current symptoms) ... The penis, testicles, prostate, etc. are all underdeveloped. Hyperactive reflex function, sexual neurasthenia, and neurasthenia are all present. And suffering from third-degree phimosis, only the front end of the glans has a tiny channel exposed. (Treatment method) ... Perform surgery to remove the phimosis, retract the foreskin, suture the gaps, and use "Simit's Sperm-Locking Tablets" to treat his nocturnal emission. At the same time, take "Fertility Hormone" to treat his sexual weakness, neurasthenia, and underdevelopment, etc., and he was completely cured after two months.</p>

<p>Editor: The stomach problem I suffered from as early as ten years ago was really caused by eating improperly and without restraint, and I liked cold drinks, so my stomach was damaged, and I often felt unbearable pain. In addition, my appetite was not good and my diet was drastically reduced. I was introduced by a friend in mid-autumn to take "Stomach Pain Relief," and my stomach pain was slightly healed. At the same time, I took "Stomach Strengthening Hormone," so my digestion improved. (Xu Yi)</p>

<p>Editor: I contracted gonorrhea due to several acts of prostitution. I was also misled by medicine, and the acute disease turned into a chronic disease. It lasted for three years, and I only got "Anti-Gonorrhea," a combination of flavochrome and vaccine, from a friend this summer, and I was completely cured. Three years of pain were relieved in one fell swoop, and I know that there must be many people in society who are doing this, so I sincerely recommend it. (Chen Haihan)</p>

<p>Sir: I heard from my roommate that vaginal discharge is a common disease for women, but the vaginal discharge I suffer from is unusually surging. It also emits strange odors, causing me great mental suffering. Fortunately, my husband is wise. Seeing the report that "Cure Discharge Spirit" has cured countless cases of vaginal discharge, he bought a box from Wing On Company, and after external use, the discharge stopped completely. It can be said to be effective. (Shen Ling)</p>

<p>Editor: My father is old. After contracting an illness this summer, he was bedridden for three months. Although he has now recovered, his spirit is not as full as before, and his muscles are thin. He has little energy when talking and working. Although the family tried their best to replenish him, it was ineffective. My uncle bought "Fertility Hormone" from the French Pharmacy to replenish him. The vitality was greatly restored. Not only did his spirit improve, but his body became stronger. He has a great prospect of being stronger as he gets older. This is really effective, and I would like to talk about it with those who have the same disease.</p>

<p>Every girl is willing to be praised: "So beautiful." So they try every means to seek the beauty method. Applying powder has become a common practice in the women's world. But can powder absolutely turn ugliness into beauty? No, it is completely impossible.</p>
<p>A yellow and thin face is covered with powder. She thinks she is proud, but she does not expect others to be scolding her for being ugly and trying too hard. Once she accidentally reveals her true face, she is still ugly. Even if she is good at makeup, it is impossible. Moreover, modern concepts of beauty do not only pay attention to facial beauty. On the contrary, they regard the beauty of posture as the first requirement: obvious curves, firm skin, and plump breasts must be loud and elastic. Can this be achieved by any powder?</p>
<p>On the sports field and in the swimming pool, there is no place for powder to stand. The true, era-appropriate health and beauty are revealed, and there is no need for any disguise. It is true that many women do warmly welcome such beauty, but because they cannot get it, they have to use powder as a disguise. For these people, we are willing to do our best to persuade them to take the gonad preparation "Female Fertility Hormone," which can make the gonads developed and all parts of the body perfectly developed. The shriveled breasts can be transformed into towering ones, and the dry and rough skin will turn into smooth and plump ones. The various limbs develop evenly, and the curves can be fully revealed. In this way, having all the beauty of posture, you will naturally be moving. Why do you need powder!</p>
<p>As for thinness caused by vaginal discharge, it is appropriate to use "Cure Discharge Spirit" to stop vaginal discharge; if you have ever suffered from gonorrhea, it is appropriate to take the combination of vaccine and flavochrome "Anti-Gonorrhea" internally.</p>

<h3 id="e208">The Contribution of Bone Pain Therapy <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Zhou Xiaohan</p>
<p>No matter the disease, it must have its origin. However, the same disease can have different origins. For example, the symptom of joint pain mentioned in this article, its origin, has several types. Therefore, whether the treatment is effective depends on whether the medicinal power contained in the prescribed medicine can treat all of its sources. For example, if the patient suffers from this symptom due to internal dampness caused by rheumatism, treating it with bone pain methods for venereal disease will be useless and harmful. Conversely, it will also lead to many problems. Therefore, those who contracted gonorrhea due to early sexual encounters, if they experience joint pain, the treatment should prioritize clearing the blood. They must take a combination of yellow pigment and Fackin's preparation "Antilin" to thoroughly eliminate the gonorrhea that remains in the mucous membrane. Then, take "Johnston's Bone Pain Tablets" to relax the joints and soothe the meridians. Even if the illness progresses to hemiplegia, recovery is not difficult.</p>
<p>Patient Wu Minsheng, 39 years old, suffered from spermatorrhea for three years ten years ago, so in recent years, he has experienced pain in his whole body joints. Although he tried ordinary bone pain treatment, it was ineffective. Later, under the guidance of a doctor, he took "Antilin" and "Johnston's Bone Pain Tablets." Because the residual toxins of gonorrhea were cleared, and "Johnston's Bone Pain Tablets" can also dispel dampness, clear blood, and prevent arteriosclerosis, he soon recovered his health.</p>

<p>It is said that a school principal is a "lucrative position," especially in public schools. However, this "lucrative position" now seems not even as good as "chicken ribs," because although chicken ribs are tasteless to eat, it is still a pity to discard them. But now there are those who think being a school principal is not as good as being a postman, and it is not a pity to discard the position. If you don't believe it, here is a newspaper report to prove it:</p>
<p>Wenling Correspondence: Wang Yungao, principal of Guanxiao Cai Elementary School (formerly the Fifth County Elementary School) in the western district of this county... Now, because the cost of living is increasing, and a monthly income of a dozen yuan is not enough to make ends meet, he took the postman exam at the Wenling Post Office the other day. Yesterday, I heard that Mr. Wang has already submitted his resignation from the position of principal to the county government..."</p>
<p>The principal here should actually be called an elementary school principal. To put it more precisely, it should be an inland elementary school principal. Because many university presidents drive cars and live in Western-style houses. Even some principals of public and private primary and secondary schools are well-fed and clothed. I have not heard of anyone expressing discouragement about the education career and insisting on leaving in anger.</p>
<p>If the reader is not forgetful, you should remember that when transferring principals, this faction and that faction, this system had special effects, and that system was extremely vicious, fighting and snatching, even breaking heads and firing guns, etc. If it weren't because the "principal" was a lucrative position, why would they be so unwilling to let go? It can be seen that there is a big difference in the ranks of "principals," and for this rank, some people show special enthusiasm for education, and even if they are dismissed, they are still willing to be responsible to the end; while some people only care about profit and abandon the position like old shoes.</p>
<p>For the latter, we will take Wang Yungao, the principal of Guan Wei Cai Elementary School in Wenling, as an example. Wang Yungao is unwilling to be a principal because his monthly income is only a dozen yuan, while a postman generally earns 20 yuan. So Principal Wang would rather be a postman. The rank and status between a principal and a postman are vastly different, but Wang Yungao disregards his status and reputation for the sake of money, which shows that he is indeed a utilitarian. In terms of the spirit of service, although a postman also serves the public, it is not as meaningful as a principal cultivating talents for the country and society. Gan Yungao was able to disregard everything and resolutely take off his official hat, proving that the problem of eating is always higher than everything else.</p>
<p>"Only when clothing and food are sufficient will people know etiquette and righteousness." Asking a hungry person to teach is like asking a beggar to talk about integrity. Although there have been many enthusiastic educators advocating and promoting education in China in recent years, the result of such "enthusiasm" is that most common people have no way to receive secondary education, and a small number who can go to school are just getting a diploma, and at most, creating gilded mediocrities who go to the West. In terms of talent, they are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns.</p>
<p>Let's talk about primary education. The general phenomenon is that a person does not become an elementary school teacher until they are extremely bored. So those who can be postmen go to be postmen. The remaining ones are like the old, weak, and disabled soldiers in the army, who only know a few words, or even don't know any and still muddle along. So most of the primary schools in China are not "cultivating talents" but "killing talents." Regarding Wang Yungao's seeking a better job, and some educational celebrities who drive cars and live in Western-style houses, opening their mouths about what education is and closing their mouths about what education is, it is really tearful and laughable!</p>

<p>— Li Liwen</p>
<p>—Encounter One—</p>
<p>The boat entered the mouth of Santiaou Bay, and the seawater gradually became lighter.</p>
<p>The night breeze gently blew up. The setting sun reflected a vast and brilliant scene on the sea. Fishermen returning from the sea were rowing their small boats——the night breeze lightly carried the gentle sound of the oars that often evoke infinite thoughts in people——slightly——creak——creak——</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>People were crowding on one side of the deck, and a complex emotion was gently scratching at their hearts. On the shore, the gray-blue, mighty mountains, the verdant trees, and the exquisite wooden houses painted in various colors, seemed to be sleeping in the golden afterglow of the setting sun, silently and colorlessly radiating a premonition of tranquility and happiness.</p>
<p>The stern rumbled——rumbled——splashed——churning up a pile of turbid yellow waves, and the boat stopped trembling.</p>
<p>I got off the boat, carrying my only luggage——a half-new imitation leather suitcase, and walked for several hours on the narrow, dark streets of Santiaou, then, stuffed a few pieces of "Roti" (Note 1) into my pocket, and got on that yellow, old, long-distance bus.</p>
<p>In the car, I swallowed two pieces of Roti——and fell into a daze and fell asleep. Several days of life at sea had not allowed me to be quiet, and fatigue seemed to erupt at me all at once. A Dutch ticket inspector woke me up, and I subconsciously handed over my ticket, and then fell back into a dazed sleep. When a kind fellow passenger woke me up, I had already——arrived in Bangka.</p>
<p>I rubbed my sleepy eyes, and in the sky, golden brilliance had already shone, shining on my back with a slight warmth. Several Bornean natives (Note 2) with strange clothes and fierce looks passed by me, and a peculiar smell almost made me sneeze.</p>
<p>I walked along a small road onto the bustling Dabogong Street. At the end of the street, I found the place that made me cross mountains and rivers with my only hope——a not-so-large grocery store. I excitedly and hesitantly stepped inside. My sister's husband was busy copying something at the counter, and the shop assistants cast strange glances at me. I walked to the front of the counter——my brother-in-law looked up, and I seemed to see something from his long-unseen, round, plump, ruddy face, and almost wanted to jump in and hug him——and go wild with joy... However, my brother-in-law's cold, almost expressionless gaze stopped me, and he simply uttered a sentence to me:</p>
<p>"You're here?"</p>
<p>I didn't answer, something deeply stimulated me, making my whole body tremble slightly: I wanted to hold my brother-in-law's hand and ask him why he had hurt my feelings like this——but I didn't do it, but instead humbly and almost pleadingly narrated everything that had happened, I told him how I had begged acquaintances for travel expenses and came to Borneo with such a passionate heart...</p>
<p>"Brother-in-law," I said——a tear suddenly rolled down my nose. "Give me a job, any kind of job——I can take care of myself."</p>
<p>"Young man——everything has changed now. I am really saddened by the degeneration of young people. Actually, why is it necessary to do this? Everyone has their own duty!"</p>
<p>"This is not our problem, brother-in-law, please give me a job! I promise you, I am a very good worker——don't think I ran away from school."</p>
<p>My brother-in-law yawned at length. "You are an excessively stubborn person. Look here——there won't be a job that suits you!"</p>
<p>"No——no," I almost shouted out. "As long as it is a job, it doesn't matter where you send me——I am suitable for anything."</p>
<p>My brother-in-law fell silent, shaking his head slightly like a pendulum, and picked up the pen with one hand——and began to write.</p>
<p>When closing the shop in the evening, my brother-in-law handed over five shields, giving me a deadly blow like an arrow with that cold, expressionless tone:</p>
<p>"You should go back on the boat you came on. You don't need to go to your sister's grave——the bus leaves at 8:10, go early and you might be able to get a good seat."</p>
<p>I stood blankly under the dim kerosene lamp, I wanted to cry, and I wanted to laugh heartily——suddenly I snatched the money from my brother-in-law's hand, picked up the suitcase——and rushed out. ...</p>
<p>On the street, a night atmosphere was looming, and the mighty mountains of Borneo were dimly overlooking everything with their towering shadows. The shops had closed their wooden doors, and a faint yellow light leaked from the gaps in the boards.</p>
<p>I strode forward, one hand still tightly grasping that paper shield, and a slight coolness of the Borneo sea breeze was felt on my body.</p>
<p>Note 1: Roti, Malay: bread.</p>
<p>Note 2: There are two kinds of Borneo savages——one lives in the deep mountains all year round, eating raw meat and drinking blood, and the other lives scattered in the foothills, communicating with people. The former is called: raw savage, the latter is called: cooked savage.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Impressions After Seeing the First National Cartoon Exhibition <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Ji</p>
<p>("In the decline of a chaotic age, writing emerges"—Xunzi)</p>
<p>In fact, it is not necessarily writing; all art, all art produced in the hands of artists living in a chaotic world, inevitably presents a kind of helpless smiling tears. However, this "helplessness" does not mean that people are truly helpless. On the contrary, it shows that the artists of a generation have worked hard to actively find solutions in helplessness.</p>
<p>This characteristic exists not only in all outstanding essays in modern times, but also in the emerging folk art of cartoons.</p>
<p>People are becoming smarter. Nowadays, no writer, whether writing or painting, circles around certain prescribed themes. Expanding the scope of creative themes is a gratifying phenomenon. Because, as Mr. Lu Xun said, we not only remember "we," but we must also remember "they" outside of us: similarly, we not only have to describe "great work," but also describe "debauchery and shamelessness."</p>
<p>This has been quite well expressed in the three emerging arts of essays, prints, and cartoons in recent years. Although there may still be room for further discussion technically, the suffering of people in chaotic times, the ardent longing for light, the hatred of the baseness of the world... etc. can be seen.—Even if the art of a chaotic age is inevitably put on a different face, this face still makes us feel more noble and lovable than the face of a dog.</p>
<p>These emotions were quite evident in all the more than two hundred works in the First National Cartoon Exhibition. Because we still remember the various practical difficulties, in this regard, even if we sometimes feel that it is somewhat "poor," we no longer make excessive complaints.</p>
<p>The name "cartoon" at this exhibition is quite broad. It not only refers to the general so-called "caricature" (Cariture) (naturally, this is the most in number), but also includes "sketches," book illustrations (such as Cao Hanmei's "Golden Lotus" meticulous brushwork), and even "poster designs" (National Cartoon Exhibition posters). And the content, like the form, is very multifaceted. The lack of a central temperament seems to be a regret that cannot be ignored. In terms of highly accomplished techniques, we must mention Cao Hanmei's "Golden Lotus illustrations" and Zhang Guangyu's "Hanging Branches". In addition, Ye Qianyu's "Portrait of a Certain Lady," Zimei's "Anna May Wong," and Zhang Wenyuan's "Grand View Garden" also gave us very hard-to-remove good impressions. However, it seems that the most thrilling ones are not these delicate and exquisite works. Three works that used great intelligence in terms of technique and gave people clear and understandable themes should be cited: "The Country is Broken, the Mountains and Rivers Remain" (Gao Longsheng), "Tai Chi Diagram" (Shao Yucun), and "Only the State Magistrate is Allowed to Set Fires" (Lin Daoan). That kind of expression method that makes people know at a glance should be one of the main characteristics of cartoons. I personally do not admire those obscure things that are not easy to understand. Of course, this is due to the poverty of personal artistic cultivation, but I think that if cartoons really should belong to the masses, then those grotesque and mysterious brushstrokes are not a good path. Modern artists have gotten rid of a strange concept and no longer regard making their works incomprehensible as a proud goal.</p>
<p>This decision to hold an exhibition had a lot of visitors. People hope to find their own pain, tears, cries, and comfort in the hard work of the artists. I don't think this is an excessive request, right? And in this regard, when we recall the past print exhibitions, we cannot help but feel a little demanding in terms of content achievement.</p>
<p>However, even so, we saw the hard work of the organizers and creators—in front of the torn map, what more can we ask for?</p>

<p>Dreaming of the Red Mansion, surnamed Wang. Sister Feng's bones are too light. She is unrestrained and no one cares about her. She only loves beauty, greed, and wealth, and is busy scheming. The most ridiculous thing is that Jia Rui has thoughts and wants to touch her. He tries to seduce her several times, wanting Feng to marry him. Who knows that Xifeng has a poisonous heart. She calls her two nephews, Rong and Qiang, to discuss together. Everyone sets up the lovers' trap. It's a pity, public morality is completely lacking. Greedy Rui is happy. In the evening, he sneaks through the wall gate. He sneaks into the alley and waits for the door to open. The cold wind is hard to resist. Suddenly, the window opens upstairs, which makes him happy. He doesn't expect that a pot of urine pours down on him, and the smell is unbearable. Jia Rui is drenched all over. He is designing to run away in a panic. The hateful Jia Rong holds a torch and comes out. He grabs him on the spot and wants to send him to the execution ground. Jia Qiang comes out to mediate. He forces him to write a debt agreement. From then on, Rui becomes ill. His mind is turned upside down and he lies on the bed. He soon dies young. Jiang Binchu Three Smiles</p>

<p>One mother gave birth to nine sons. She also gave birth to a daughter. Returning to the court with glory. The gatekeeper reports to the inner hall. The lady hears and rushes out to greet. She welcomes the husband to the inner hall. Husband, I have been crowned emperor abroad for twelve years. Lady, I hope you are safe and sound. I don't know which of the nine sons is good. I hope the lady will tell me about their whereabouts. Husband, the eldest son is the prime minister in the court. The second son sits in the hall as a successful candidate in the imperial examination. The third son is granted the title of Earl in Yunnan. The fourth son is the Minister of War. The fifth son is the governor. The sixth son teaches the crown prince literature. The seventh son is the left deputy censor. The eighth son is the Minister of Personnel. The ninth son is still young. He won the top scholar last year. One daughter is sixteen years old. The Emperor wants her to be his concubine. The nine daughters-in-law are virtuous. Eight granddaughters accompany her in the embroidery room. Twelve grandsons are skilled in literature and martial arts. Everyone discusses literature in the study. Sometimes they can fight with swords and spears. Twenty years ago, I received a sign. They are full of officials in red robes and hats. There is also a golden dragon hanging in the center. Now there are many rich nine sons and grandsons</p>

<p>Yuan Chang (120) Midnight 0:45 to 1:30 Opening: "Wang Shipeng Visits the Prime Minister"</p>
<p>Ten years of hard work in the study. He became famous all over the world in one fell swoop. Yesterday was the imperial banquet in the Qionglin Garden. Today, he should visit the prime minister. The second and third place winners also submit their posts. They bow respectfully and talk about the academy. After a few words of small talk over fragrant tea, he kindly asks the top scholar to stay. You are the first among the three hundred candidates. Your literary talent is as high as the Big Dipper. My young daughter is still unmarried. I would like to recruit you as my son-in-law. The top scholar leaves his seat and calls him Master Xiang. The golden hairpin has already been betrothed to the right family. The wife of chaff does not leave the hall. The poor friend cannot be forgotten. Stopping the wife and marrying another is a violation of morality. Glory does not oppress a strange man. Wealth cannot change an ambitious man. He refuses the marriage and angers the treacherous prime minister. He leaves without saying goodbye. I think, this kid is ignorant and reckless. There is no discussion. Who will discuss with you again? He orders him to be transferred to Chaoyang.</p>

<p>Robert Taylor, the ideal lover in the hearts of women who has been in the film industry for only a few years, is meeting the Shanghai audience again from today in the blockbuster "政海巾幗" (State of the Union) publicly screened at the Nanjing Grand Theater. He is paired with Hollywood's glamorous star Joan Crawford. She plays a smart and capable woman in the film, relying on her far-sighted mind and extraordinary thinking, which is enough to influence the political situation of President Jackson's era in the United States at that time. In addition, the scenes of love between men and women are added, which makes it more vivid, lively, and intriguing. In order to produce this film, MGM not only paid attention to the exquisite production of costumes, props, and sets, but also put a lot of effort into the selection of actors. In addition to the two stars mentioned above, the supporting actors include the experienced Lionel Barrymore, the romantic young man Franchot Tone, Melvyn Douglas, and James Stewart. When the film was publicly screened in the United States, newspapers unanimously praised it as a great work that could compete with "叛艦喋血記" (Mutiny on the Bounty) and "舊金山" (San Francisco).</p>
<h3 id="e221">Minxin News <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>Because the character played by Liang Saizhu needs a lot of small props, such as watches, bracelets, earrings, and rings, Xiong Chun, who is in charge of managing costumes and props during filming, draws the patterns one by one in order to prevent mistakes.</p>
<p>In addition to serving as the photographer for "靈肉之門" (Gate of Flesh and Spirit), photographer Zhuang Guojun also serves as the photographer for "新人道" (New Humanity) with Shi Shipan, so he works in the studio almost every day.</p>
<p>One of the main sets of "靈肉之門" (Gate of Flesh and Spirit) - the courtroom, has been filmed a few days ago. The courtroom scene is the final closing scene of the whole play, so not only all the protagonists and main characters of the whole film appear, but also more than 50 extras and extras also participate in the filming at the same time. Before filming, director Zhong Shigen visited lawyer Wu Chengyu to refer to all the details in the courtroom.</p>
<p>Bu Wancang, the director of "新人道" (New Humanity), and technician Li Geng went to Qingjiangpu a few days ago to see the location of the film, and now they have returned to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Jin Qingyu's new work "鬩墻記" (Fratricide) has now been mostly written. "靈肉之門" (Gate of Flesh and Spirit) and "新人道" (New Humanity) will be published in one volume.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Li Minghui and the Spotted Leopard <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>Foreign women are currently in vogue for raising spotted leopards. They buy leopard cubs and use milk to raise them. When they grow up, they are tamed like cats, but they are more beautiful than cats.</p>
<p>However, their original animal nature has not been extinguished. If they return to the mountains and forests and hear the howling of their kind, they will suddenly feel that they belong to the mountains and forests, to their kind. Then, they will immediately hate their owners and would rather return to the mountains and forests to live a wild life of struggle and foraging. But this is free and liberated. No matter how rich and delicious the food their owners provide, it is still bound and unfree.</p>
<p>As the female lead Li Minghui in the new film "淸明時節" (Qingming Season), which has recently completed filming, the playwright Yao Xinong's metaphor of the spotted leopard to portray her character as the maid Chunlan is very appropriate. In the era of the maid, because of the oppression of the environment and power, she was as docile as a lamb, living a slave life. But once she came into contact with her kind - the toiling workers - and returned to their masses, when people tried to subdue her again, she completely changed. She also has a strong sense of self-esteem, resistance, and not being oppressed.</p>
<p>"淸明時節" (Qingming Season) depicts human self-esteem very thoroughly, and director Yang Yuqian's technique in handling the whole play is very vivid and lovely.</p>
