<p>— 星</p>
<p>近者吾國駐外某大使。於離國以前。在首都演說外交問題。於過去吾國外交之失策。感想萬千。氏謂過去外交。往往憑意氣之衝動。不察國際之實在情勢。而坐失機會。噬臍莫及。最明顯者。如巴黎和會之際。列强已有五年以後交還治外法權之意。國人以堅執立卽收回治外法權。雖三年之期亦以爲太長。降至今日。治外法權仍未收回。此巴黎和會中之坐失良機也。華盛頓會議之際。膠濟路收回問題。爲其他一切談判之關鍵所在。本代表已表示相當之讓步。如鐵路之會計主任等用中國人。而以日本人爲副當時中國代表團爲民衆團體所包圍。民衆之意。主張完全收回代表團無計可施。拒絕日本之讓步。日本代表以爲事無可爲。轉趨强硬。經英美諸國之調解。卒以日本人爲正中國人爲副之决定爲妥恊。此則華盛頓會議中之弄巧爲拙之例也。九一八之事發生。吾國國民反對直接交涉之聲浪至高。政府亦不明國聯之內容。而欲以第三者出任調停。結果第三者無能爲力。而日本之侵略。得隴望蜀。無所底止。使當時善用時機。則敵國之內侵或不至於此。氏謂弱國之外交。當審度內外情勢。權衡彼此實况。於八成之可能性中。做到七成五。已爲難能可貴。懸案當求早日解决。蓋懸案愈多。於弱國愈不利也。</p>
<p>推氏之見解。以爲過去國民之意。表現於外交問題者。在質量方面。尙不能符合吾人之理想。蓋國民於外交之實際需要。尙欠了解。使外交家坐失良機。使國家反受損失。然民意在質量上固有不足。吾人决不能因此斷定民意在數量上已超過必要之程度。蓋吾國過去外交之失敗。一方面固由於人民與政府尙未切實做到一致之地步。一方面則因爲政府後盾之民意。爲量尙未充分。假使有充分的民意。而此民意又以最精確之方向最合於需要之途徑表現。則外交局面或不至於此。過去民意表現之未符理想。其勢力尙未充分與偉大者。蓋有下列諸因。人民於外交問題。不感興趣也。人民於外交問題之判斷。太尙感情也。人民於實際外交進行及環境實况。所知不多。亦無從知悉也。領導民意者。無一致之態度無共同之信念也。此諸原因政府當負大半責任。蓋民意之形成。以精確之認識爲條件。政府於外交進行。諱莫如深新聞檢査無微不至。民衆旣爲盲目。其愛國情緒之激盪。自不能表現於理智方面。而重於感情方面。更有大部份民衆。以對於實際情形之無從知悉。於國事遂採不聞不問之態度。亡國之禍卽在目前。而尙置若罔聞。領導民意之輿論界。更一以不明眞相。二以懼於發表意見。遂不能盡其指導人民爲政府外交後盾之責。在此種情形之下。欲民意之質量上精確。數量上充分。蓋亦難矣。</p>
<p>故吾人認爲弱國外交。使無精確的充分的民意爲後盾。必至於失敗。過去民意之不精確。固如某大使之言。過去民意之未充分。更値得吾人之留意。所望於政府者。解除言論之的束。使外交進行於可能範圍中對民衆公開。所望於人民者。於外交問題提高興趣。切實注意。而以理智爲判斷之準繩。以事實爲是非之根據。新聞界庶可以盡其天責。而外交家亦可以减少困難矣。</p>

<p>— 趙人</p>
<p>風險卽損失或傷害之機緣。損失或傷害能預料其必定發生，吾人可事先防範，估計其損失或傷害之價値，或聽天由命任其自然。倘損失或傷害未必發生，但有發生之可能，且發生後損失或傷害之程度不能預測，則發生及發生後之結果，胥待機綠。機綠之特點卽在不確定，故風險之起源亦由於不確定。人老而死爲必然之事，但死在何歲，如何死法，皆在不可知之數。九十五歲以上之人，其生命眞如朝露，隨時可死。三四十歲之人，誰能料其必死，又有誰能料其必死於非命，然世人眞有三四十歲而不死者，亦眞有三四十歲而死於非命者，以是三四十歲之人，雖不必日夕憂慮其死，但亦不能必其不死，其他歲數之人亦如是。此卽所謂風險，風險之本體在此爲生存或死亡，風險之起源，在此由於生存或死亡之不確定。工廠內之汽鍋，使用日久而老舊窳毀不能工作，亦爲必然之事，故管理工廠者，得依汽鍋使用之年數，佔計其損失之程度，而作爲工廠製造成本費用之一部。但汽鍋有能繼續使用迄至老舊窳毀不能工作者，亦有汽鍋可以使用之期限未滿，而驟然爆炸銷毀者，究竟誰家工廠之汽鍋，半途必炸，無人敢爲預言，但每個汽鍋，炸或不炸，悉屬可能，故凡備有汽鍋之工廠，均有汽鍋爆炸之風險，而風險之起源，在此由於炸或不炸之不確定。又如經營商業，火要在以低價批入，高價售出，從中取利，然除少數享有專利權或壟斷政策已成功者外，貨物進出之價格，隨時隨地受市塲供求之影響，漲落靡定。購價低而賣價高，則嬴利之機會大，購價高而賣價低，則必受損失，且嬴利之機會，不獨視經營商業者對於市塲變動之銳敏準確之觀察，以定賣賈之價格與數量，而人員之佈置，欵項之籌措，其適當與吾，亦足以影響嬴利之有無。經營妥善則保持已有資本而外，尙可賺得嬴利，經營失當，則損失資本猶不足，以是經營商業者一經决定某業，卽冒資本損失之風險，而風險之起源，在此由於運用資本以求嬴利之不確定。至於購置房產而虞火災，舶運貨物而虞沉沒，投資實業則慮公司破產，購買債券則慮本息無着，企業者固有損失資本之憂，而勞動界允感失業賦閒之苦，其故悉由於不確定。以是風險問題，實隨時隨地縈環於吾人社會經濟之組織與動作中。</p>
<p>風險可分爲靜態與動態兩種。個人安居樂業而在某歲死或不死，房屋依然或被焚或不焚，是爲靜態的風險。賽車跑馬而死於非命或不死，經營商業應付變幻不測之市塲，或損失資本或保持資本而外尙有嬴餘，是爲動態的風險。風險又可分爲投機性與單純性兩種。投機性之風險，有損失之機會，但亦有嬴餘之希望。如買賣證券經營工商農礦，不幸而損失，當然無從恢復，但幸而成功，則嬴利必遠逾所期。單純性之風險，如房屋機器，倘兆焚如，則損失絕對不能恢復，卽幸而保存，亦决不因保存而除原有之使用效率外加增嬴利希望。按其性質風險又可分爲五種。一爲自然風險，如旱潦風雹霜雪火災等。其影響於收穫畜牧及交通極鉅，而災害之來及其結果，實難預測。二爲生產風險，現代生產需要機器及勞工，而機器中如汽鍋，則有爆炸之虞，其原因由於材料之不堅實及管理者之疏忽，其影響則使生產停頓，如勞工則以功作效率礙難使其標準化，繼續畫一，故生產不能預如所期。而上述之自然風險，允足使原料來源及價格發生劇變，使生產之結果。無論量與値，均時有减低之虞。又如農業生產，因依賴自然之力量極大，故投機性最顯。三爲社會性風險，如戰爭暴動罷工停廠搶刦贋造等。四爲個人愚蒙之風險，此項風險由於個人未能利用現成之機會與智識，使銳敏者爭前而獲得意外之利益，而愚弱者落後遭受競爭之損失。此在商業中新事業創造人之勇進牟利，而追隨者難與頡頏，爲通常之現象。五爲市塲風險，因時間有先後，故市塲上之供求價格時在變動，而商人遂不得不負擔因時間而起之市價變動之風險。</p>
<p>抑風險尙有程度之別，損失而能必共發生，甚至發生之時期亦可預測，則損失無論如何鉅大，不得謂爲風險。如前所言，此種損失或聽其自然，或可事先防範，或化爲成本。最大之風險，乃在最大之不確定一點，此卽槪然邏輯或數學中，所謂成功與失敗之機綠適彼此相等時。失敗之機緣，離成功之機緣愈遠愈大，則失敗之槪然性愈高，而其不確定或風險愈小。彼經營商業者，其所作爲，實類日夕持秤衡量其賣買之得失。嬴利可必，自必趨之，損失一定，或竭力避免，或將其化爲成本而併入賣價中，其衷心忐忑不能解决者，乃在得失適相貼近時。蓋以此最爲不確定故。俗語「亦許賺錢亦許不賺錢」卽表示此種心理及風險。</p>
<p>風險之程度不同，風險之估計亦視人與其境地而異。中產者除能保衣食外，財源有限，故損失雖小而犧牲甚大，對於各種風險之估計必高。富厚者家私百萬，故損失雖及數千，而毫無難色，對於同樣之風險，其佔價必低。例如今日證券市塲之投機，雖貧富均有，而資力薄弱者，除極少數肯作孤注一擲外，類皆少得卽足。而資力雄厚者必忍受損失，以待善價，其下注旣大，故所希冀者必高，而其損失或嬴利必鉅。然此非謂資力雄厚者必不敗，事實上共問且多雄資而因連續失利，以至傾家蕩產者，然必竟財力充裕者對於損失之風險，佔價較低，故敢繼續投機，損必大損，嬴必大贏。又有某種風險，其佔價有準確之數字可稽，例如擲銅元一枚而賭其擲出正面可得十元，但銅子擲出正面之機綠率爲二分之一，擲出反面之機綠率亦爲二分之一，以十元乘二分之一得五元，卽爲此項風險之估價，人壽保險之運用，卽基於此項原則。</p>
<p>風險旣爲普遍之現象，吾人將何以處置之？其道有三，一爲風險之消除，二爲直接自行負擔風險，三爲將風險轉移他人。第一種如吾人置備雨傘預防雨雪，建築高牆隔離鄰火。如商業則對於市塲有翔實應時之統計，隨時分析其供求狀况，對於內部則施行科學管理，提高效率消滅浪費。如人之生死，雖不能預測，而可由人壽保險公司，集合多人之壽命，公攤死亡之損失。如銀行爲防止提存擠兌，必須設置相當之準備金。如進出口商入同時購進近期賣出遠期之外匯，以免匯兌風險等均是。第二種如企業者除工人給以約定之工資，債權人給與約定之利息外，其他損益統由個人自行擔負。書生紈絝，惑認經營商業，如盲人瞎馬，危險萬分，而商人則以習慣經騐視若故常，雖有損失之風險，大都認爲自然，勇往直前。又如資本家及投機者亦多自行直接投資實業或買賣蹬券。問有工人不問工資多寡，而逕行工作，藉工作機會以求收入者，實例雖不多，但海上旅館飯店之待役，頗近乎此。第三種如稍有積蓄之家，類多轉托銀行代爲投資，或存欵於銀行錢莊，代爲生息，其意蓋以此等組織對於風險之負擔，依其專門智識及經騐，比較能力强大。與其直接投資，損益莫測，何若將此項風險轉嫁專家。夫銀行錢莊並非絕對安全，然在普通情形之下，其鑒別投資之能力，究較私人爲强，此無可否認者也。總之社會組織愈繁密，信用經濟愈發達，則風險之種類愈多，而防止風險之方法因政府對之督促私人團體之硏究亦愈進步。</p>

<h3 id="c82">塞漠生活考察記　（五） <a href="#c82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— 金兌</p>
<p>（丁）畜產用途及銷路　甘省番回人民原以內乳為養料的大宗，所以，甘肅羊肉一項，幾可視作糧食之一，所餘毛革輸出省外，以為織造原料，為數亦夥，自淸季海禁通後，常遠輸及海外，上海天津漢口等處洋行，輒有派人分駐於臨潭，岷縣，夏河，靖遠，海原等縣，就地收買，西北交通梗塞，恃爲運輸的工具，多趨重於牲畜的力量，因以牛，馬，驢，騾，駱駝，都成爲最重要的交通運輸工具，牛類允以岷縣所產的大扁牛，力大性馴，駕車耕田，最爲合用，夏河連城等處所產的小毛牛，又名芝牛，除供力用外，多運銷到省城各地，取乳肉給人們做飮食的用途，永登，臨潭，岷縣的馬匹，每年鎖售於河南陜西等省，充備軍馬，爲數亦很多。</p>
<p>七、甘肅的羊毛業</p>
<p>甘肅與陜西·綏遠·寗夏·靑海等省相接，其氣候和西北各省，大致相同，因地之利，最宜牧畜，已槪述前文，以是民間有游牧為生的，牧羊的猶佔多數，不似東南各省以養羊爲附產物了。者。全年所產羊毛，除供給本省用做毛毯，毛褐，栽羢與各種毛編物的工業製造原料外，每年出口，根據該省民國日報的刋載，民國二十一年度調査：春毛一五·四〇六·擔，每擔百斤，價二十元，共計洋三〇八·一二〇元，秋毛一五·四〇六擔，每擔百斤，價二十五元，共計洋三八五·一五〇元，二十二年度調查：春毛二一·三六二擔，每擔百斤，價二十元，共計洋四二七·二四〇元，秋毛二一·三六二擔，每擔百斤，價二十五元，共計洋五三四·〇五〇元，又根據建設廳的統計，二十三年度調査，僅就二十八縣的詳細報吿，總計年產量一·三二九·四三八公斤，年產價值六一八·九四九元，倘得全年各縣通盤計算，當更不止此數，產毛豐富，概可想見。</p>
<p>羊毛類別，普通分爲棉羊毛（白羊毛）與山羊毛（黑羊毛）兩種，甘肅所產，除上二種外，尙有所謂　　毛，爲山羊而身長白毛，可製皮衣，及毡毯毛布用，不宜製造毛呢，因其細羢太少，性質堅硬，又一種呌紫羊毛，是棉羊而身長黑毛，多產於西藏，故又名藏羊，最宜製作皮衣，因其細羢較多，保溫力强，雖在嚴冬，亦可禦寒，且棉羊黑毛，很覺稀罕，所以很得人們的樂用。</p>
<p>在紡織原料中用的羊毛，多選纖維細長，具相當彈力和光澤，織製各式毛呢，隨意著染顏色，而且天然產量在各種羊毛中，比較豐富的，具着這種特點的，就是棉羊毛了。反過來說，纖維粗細不勻，色澤灰黯，著染色彩不能盡如人意，且棉羊每頭剪毛可得一斤，山羊郤只得半斤，所以這就屬於山羊毛的劣點了。</p>
<p>剪取羊毛，大的分做春秋兩季，春季剪期在淸明前後，羊毛在冬天經過嚴寒氣候，毛含羢質最多，纖維亦細，這時剪下來的呌做春毛，秋季剪期，在中秋節前後，羊毛在夏天曾受炎熱氣候，毛含油質頗大，彈力較强，這時剪下來的呌做秋毛，外此有抓毛和羊羢，多抓於夏季。至於皮毛，係製皮衣及製革，所刮下的廢毛，又呌死毛，含着石灰質甚多，不能著染色素的了。</p>
<p>每常春秋二季，羊毛上市時，由毛販在牧羊區收買，運往城市，轉售於製毛業店商，以地處邊陲交通不便故，近年甚少由內地直接來甘收買的，番民所居地方，仍有以羊毛交換日常用品的，這似乎遠在幾千年前「以物易物」的遺制，他們還在保留着，至於普通羊毛貿易，衡器亦向無標準，有用十六兩或二十四兩爲一斤的秤子，亦有用三十二兩方算一斤的秤子。這種種是由於地域遼遠，種族複雜，和風俗習慣各異的原故吧。近年以來，國內外經濟不景氣，影響所及，羊毛銷路，一落十丈。甘肅向以羊毛爲大宗的出口貨，倘能加以改良，振與毛業，固爲中國所需，提倡國貨，外溢因獲挽回，開發西北，允深利賴。</p>

<p>醫院工作　衛生處處長稱、本年因經濟困難之故、該處原有醫院及其他建設計劃、俱不克如期實現、惟界外醫院設備、漸見發展、尚堪引以為慰、所望者、此次建設之停頓、不至永久如斯、因局立醫院之房屋、已有頹廢不堪應用者、幸賴年來本埠並無厲疫重症發生、尚可勉強支持、但恐泰極否生、實不得不為未雨綢繆之想也、查公共租界現有醫院工作、約分三項、　公眾衛生之服務、　局方醫藥服務、　其他、屬於公眾衛生服務方面者、如肺病療養院·外籍男子花柳病院·種痘　打防疫針·等是、關乎工部局醫藥服務方面者、有警務人員及監犯等醫院、警務及火政處人員之衛生演講、公務人員聘任時之體格檢驗各部衛生宣傳、及莫干山療養院等、若以傳染病症而論、本年狀况、極為滿意、霍亂之未發生、已如上述、本年熱病醫院病　人、共一千四百零九人、較之上年之二千餘人、已减去百分之三十、患天花之入病院者、祇四十一人、內死三人、惟上年患者有三百六十九人、死一百三十五人、未知今年尚能保持此種良好狀態否、現本埠所感缺少者、即肺病治療所設備之不敷、新立熱病神經病醫院、又復以經濟關係而停頓、貧苦市民齒科設備、亦感缺乏、致女子小兒患牙病者日眾、兒童休養所設備、亦應添加、關於監獄醫院工作方面西牢已遷入新所衛生設備較前已大見進步、監犯所患者、除須奏力者四人外、餘悉輕微小症、遷入隔離所者二人、患神經病者二人、以上無死者、中牢方面情形、亦較前進步、衛生方面之一大改革、即為廢除以前之清潔夫役、而代以受有完備訓練之護士十二名云、</p>
<p>食物檢查　關乎飲食物清潔方面、一九三五年內、亦有顯著之進步、牛乳價格已漸見低落、惟清潔程度、則已增加、此後乙種牛乳、亦擬一律消毒、此舉大概不致發生何種阻碍、東區局立屠宰所開放之後、肉類檢查、漸有統一之可能、此於市政衛生方面、亦可云係一大進境、惟屠戶方面、尚多拘於積習、未能適量應用此項機械運用、本年食物樣品之受檢查者、有麵粉·麵包·奶油·人造奶油·乳酪·葡萄糖·牛乳糖·乳粉·亞麻子·香腸·煉乳·等、飲料之受檢資者、有威士忌·啤酒·酒精·伏特加·各種汽水菓汁·菓露等、普通情形、尚屬良好、牛奶摻雜之弊、較前已减少云、</p>
<p>學校衛生　工部局學校醫藥衛生工作、共分三大部、　局立各學校、　局立各華童小學、　界內補助金學校、第一項局立學校指立局各一、中西男女中學而言者、現局方以經濟關係、對於此等學校、應有之醫藥服務、尚未能盡量供給所能舉辦者、僅校舍及飲水之清潔等、而最重要之工作、在一九三五年度、係以華董小學五所為中心、設立臨時診斷所、及沙眼檢查等工作、惟以醫務工作人員、不敷支配、診所不能常設之故凡串沙眼者、痊癒遂覺遲延、是年小學生之受檢驗者、凡一千九百六十七人、患眼病者、佔一千一百四十三名、患皮膚病者四百四十二人、心臟不良者八百六十四名、肺弱者三百九十三名、扁桃腺症一千二百五十二人、視線不良者八十九名、心臟病患者之所以如此眾多、大約係由於兒童病後、調養時間未充足、即使復學之故、關乎補助金華人私校方面、是年視察共二千三百六十三次、大致因目前經濟凋敝之故、此等學校學額之過於擁擠、實屬最困難之問題、以前舊校衛生狀况良好者、今已成為不良好、大抵皆因學生眾多、講室地位空氣不充足之故、有已擴充校舍者、其餘則限於地盤、無法擴充、此問題現在正在衛生當局特別研究之中云、</p>
<p>夏令工作　工部局衛生處每屆夏令、即有特別之工作發生、飲料方面、街頭挑擔零售各種菓汁者、檢驗之結果、大抵皆不合人類之用、運送冰淇淋者、與以相當之憑照、以區別於其他之私售者、撲蠅亦屬夏令工作之一凡各大旅舍飯館、皆經不時檢查、使置備除蠅之物、本埠所有汽水廠十三所、亦須不時加以檢查、此外如除蚊工作、垃圾管理、以及游泳之清潔等、亦屬該處夏令工作之一部份云、</p>

<p>崇明人包健甫、年芷不惑、向在物品交易所爲經紀人、年前歇業、乃受僱於四川路二百九十九號東亞銀行、其家則住滬西赫德路二百四十弄七號、娶妻胡氏、與包同庚而復同鄉、生有二子、長名志剛、現年十三歲、在卡德路育才公學肄業、次名志炯、纔九齡、就讀於小沙渡路培仁小學、包尙有老父迎養在寓、三世同堂、家庭原甚融洽、但包於數載之前、置有外室湯氏、雖尹邢</p>
<p>素來避面</p>
<p>而包之愛情、顯已不專、故胡氏常與衝突、上年十二月十一日、包因將家內冰箱一隻、取往妾處使用、致胡氏大憤、遂與爭執、翌晨八時、胡氏竟購鴉片烟土、自行吞服、而以剩餘之四小包、置諸臥室桌上、屬其兩子於啜粥後、各服補藥、入校讀書、迨兩子餐畢入室、則胡氏已倒臥床上、即各取</p>
<p>烟土兩包</p>
<p>呑之、而後分別赴校、未幾胡氏腹中毒發、經家人以電話報知包健甫馳歸、車送海格路紅十字會醫院救治、詛胡氏甫離家門、而志剛志炯兩孩、已相繼由各該學校派人送回、由包延醫診察、始知亦係毒發、當亦亟送紅會醫院施救、該院於片刻之間、連得母子之服毒者三口、</p>

<p>敎唆自殺</p>
<p>之控訴、昨晨、由劉毓桂推事開庭、飭提包胡氏到案研訊、包健甫亦挈兩子到庭、先由捕房律師張大蔭陳述本案發生經過、謂被吿當係恐彼自殺死後、其所生之兩子、將爲無母之兒、故出此同歸於盡之舉、並將醫院診斷報吿書及志剛在醫院自書、係其母命彼兄弟呑服烟土之供狀呈案、庭上旋傳包志剛質訊</p>

<p>中央國術館國體專校赴南洋表演、宣傳體育、備受僑胞熱烈歡迎、該校領隊龐玉森、日前返國抵滬、定今晚晋京、銷假視事、據談該校在南洋表演畢後、仍將由張校長率領赴菲律賓、茲將各情誌次、</p>
<p>在菲律賓比賽程序</p>
<p>據龐氏談、該校選手過菲律賓時、因前承該地華僑籃球聯合會函約比賽、故本人率籃球隊員、同赴該會拜訪、並接洽比賽事宜、由該會會長李連朝招待、當即決定在菲比賽程序如次、一·菲律賓大學、二·聖道碼士大學、三·國民大學、四·聖迷拉書院、五·遠東大學、六·拉薩書院、七·黎薩大學、八·中西校友隊、九·華僑聯隊、以上所有比賽地點、均在黎薩紀念體育場舉行、接洽妥定後、由李會長導引各處參觀一週、隨卽登輪次早開往星加坡、</p>
<p>星埠比賽五戰五勝</p>
<p>船行六日、於二十五日早抵星、到碼頭歡迎者、計有十餘團體、及當地聞人等數百人、全體隊員下榻於九龍堂、至國術表演與籃球比賽日期、均由中華總商會與籃球排球總會商定、於一月三十一日開始至二月六日止、國術表演七日、籃球比賽五次、計二月一日對維揚籃球隊、二日對工商籃球隊、三日無、四日對崇武籃球隊、五日對業餘籃球隊、六日對星聯隊、以上五戰、我隊已得五勝、戰績如下、國體對維揚、國體八十二、維揚四十三、國體對工商、國體九十九、工商三十四、國體對崇武、國體六十一、崇武二十九、國體對業餘、國體五十一、業餘三十九、國體對星聯、國體五十五、星聯四十五、</p>
<p>國術表演觀眾踴躍</p>
<p>至國術之表演、每日節目更換、亦頗得觀衆歡迎、為限制觀眾維持秩序起見、由總商會規定購票入場、票價係四種、五角·一元·二元·三元、場內可容納五六千人、但每場仍係擁擠、坐位尚感不敷應用、在最後一日、為普及宣傳起見、是日公開表演國術、不售票、惟距表演三時前、已告人滿之患、擠得水洩不通、秩序無法維持、隨將場門關閉、蓋不准出入矣、後至者均不得其門而入、概抱向隅之嘆、查僑胞對國術感覺如此興趣、當亦對國術有良好之印象、與深刻的認識、故於敝國之宣傳工作、亦不無相當效果、殊堪自慰、</p>

<p>— Louisa　M.Alcott原著　鄧曉滄譯</p>
<p>他們都在那兒——梅格的父母馬先生和馬夫人，坦第姨丈和艾美姨母，老勞先生，現在已白發飄蕭，精神衰退，裴先生和裴夫人，及其所牧養的一　童子，此外還有許多朋友都來對於逝者表示敬意。我們猜想那巽退的喬恩柏魯客，在他勞碌，靜肅與質樸的生活裏，當無多時間以交友；然而現在他們卻是紛紛來了——老的少的，富的窮的，高級的與低級的；不知不覺間他的影響已遍及於他們，他的德行猶自昭彰，他暗地所做的許多好事都起來為他祝福。他棺旁　客的眾多與哀戚，較之馬先生所能道的，便是一篇更有力的誄詞。那裏來的有他所曾多年忠事的東家，有他為了紀念母親曾以他的薄儲帮助過的那些窮苦的老婦；還有他的妻予，他曾予以這麼的幸福，那死傷亦竟不能完全毀棄它；他的襟史與姊妹，他已深深占了他們心中的一角；他的小兒子和女兒，他們已經覺得喪失了他剛強的臂膊與柔和的聲音；幼年的兒童，為他們最和善的游伴而飲泣，高高的少年，忽然動容，在注意他們所永不能忘的一幕。一件很簡單的儀式，也是很短；馬先生本欲對於他所最敬重的女婿，表示些欽崇與愛惜，可是那老父的聲調曾於他們婚儀中忽因感動而不能畢其辭的至此竟至不能成聲。在最後一次「亞門」之後，（註）跟着是一回長長久久的靜寂，直到樓上菊綏賓賓嚶嚶的微聲方始將其打破；於是，裴先生下了一個令，那些曾受良好訓練孩子們的聲音便一齊迸發，唱出一個讚美歌，充滿了高尚而無墨礙的感情，別人也不知不覺一一加入，用他們的全心唱着，覺得他們苦難的心靈，已乘着那剛柔兼濟的讚美詩的翼上，而上昇於平安之境界了。</p>
<p>（註）『亞門』為每次祈禱之結束詞。</p>

<h3 id="c189">亟應提倡農村護士（下） <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— 殷金泉</p>
<p>關於辦理農村衞生的方案意見，也有種種，但我國學者多承認，解决我國衛生問題，唯一的出路便是採用公醫制度，的確，辦理農村衞生，必須有組織而得到最大之衞生設施，務使此種設施，能以最小的經濟，普偏全國農村，所以我國農村衛生行政，必須由國家辦理，應自中央起，至農村止，成立一個有系統之組織，然後方可用最小的經濟獲最大效果，此種組織也是歐美學者所公認的，可是這種計劃，要看政府當局之財力而定，所以在這多事之秋民窮財盡的局面，要想理想成爲事實，是很不容易的；於是又有人提倡說：「醫藥界中的人，誰個不有悲天憫人的慈善心腸，服務社會的犠牲精神，農村中可憐的情况，旣然如此，要解除農民的痛苦，必須耍我們醫藥界人，以身作則，趕快到農村去服務。」這又談何容易呢？因爲現有醫學校的畢業生，不能擔負辦理農村衛生之責任，或則資格甚高，生活程度太高；或則程度雖低，目的在營業：而且普通醫校偏重於治療，對於預防多不注意，同時是否個個有慈悲心腸，來到破産的農村去服務，還是問題，就退一步說：假使有這種慈悲心腸的人，願意服務這破產的農村，但是想靠營業是養不活身體的，再退一步說：假使有少數醫師，能够而且情願，慷慨解囊來免費施診，但靠這少數醫師的免費施診，來推行醫療到農村，是斷斷辦不到，做不通的事。</p>
<p>在這種環境之下，應農村社會的需要，而產生了農村護士的新名詞，從這名詞的字意一望，就知道與普通所謂服務醫院中的護士不同了，作者認爲農村護士，是辦理農村衛生事業的先進人才，從上面種種事實看來，對於農村護士之訓練，作者認爲以下三點，可供獻給研究農村衞生問題諸位研究。</p>
<p>農村護士人才應就地選擇　農村護士人才須就地選擇優秀份子，（初中畢業或同等資格，）經考試合格，方得擔任，因爲在農村本地生長大的，才能知道農村的風俗習慣及痛苦，才得到農民的信仰，才肯熱心的實幹。</p>
<p>農村護士訓育應注重勤儉　要以最小經濟，而得最大效果，雖然在於實施的得當，但是一部分仍須辦理者自身的能勤能儉，所以對於農村護士訓練，勤儉兩字，最應注重，這樣方不易染上都市的惡習，在現代的困苦農村間，才能克苦耐勞的去幹，而使農民得着實在的新醫保障。</p>
<p>農村護士敎材應切合需要辦理農村衛生，不需要單獨治療人才，或衛生人才，更請不起醫療衛生兩種專門人才，所以農村護士課程，應預防治療並重，使他不獨能實行衛生工作，而且能擔任治療職務，至於課程時間的分配，及一切詳細辦法，可參考首先創辦的「鎭江農村護士學校。」</p>
<p>應着社會的需要，鎮江已創辦了農村護士學校，蘇省其他各縣，不妨聞風而起，竭力提倡，由縣而省，以偏全國農村，亦爲辦理農村衛生之良法，若各學者認爲尙少系統的話，等到國事安定，國庫富裕，國家來舉辦有系統的組織的時候，這班農村護士也是爲辦理公醫制度時，最切合最需要的人才，採用以後，可以减少一部分人才訓練的時間，公醫制的進行工作，也多了一班熟手生力軍了。</p>
<p>上面說得很多了，我們不妨平心靜氣的想一想，農村破產的程度已高到極點了，農民貧病交迫日非一日，國家尙無系統之辦理農村衛生的組織，在這境遇之下，農村護士，是最切合農村衛生事業之需要，所以應亟于提倡農村護士，尙希注意農村衛生人仕加以商榷之。</p>

<h3 id="c191">醫學趨勢與國家之關係 <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— 沈松年</p>
<p>我國萬事皆落人後，雖號開化最早，均在各國之先，已有四千餘年悠久的歷史，就是根據進化論的一定公式來講：開化早的民族，一切事業的發達，皆應成正比例，——也較開化遲的各國進展得早。詎知事實適得其反，我國雖開化最早，而今國家的地位却在各國之下，已陷於落伍之途，醫學亦何獨不然呢，茲僅就管見所及，特歸納數點，略論如决。</p>
<p>（甲）國民思想之束縛</p>
<p>封建時代之帝王，爲滿足其帝王慾，防止國民叛亂，於是採取科舉制，應用八股文來束縛知識階級的思想，思想旣被束縛，遑論其他，醫學亦因之不能進步，都是故步自封了。</p>
<p>（乙）不求學術上的進展</p>
<p>各國醫學史，常常可以見到先由玄理而進於實際，中國的醫學趨勢，以前都像各國的先例，但是以後終不求學術上進展了。照理凡是先人未完成的業績，是要後來的人應該去發揮，去完成。那末，才不負先人創說時的一番苦心，所以研究與討論，是「發揮」的源泉，不求進展，對於學術的障得，影響實在是甚大。</p>
<p>（丙）不公開，守秘密</p>
<p>一切的發明，皆出於先知先覺者的理智木能，偶有所發見，卽不息的努力研究，至力有未逮　，卽公　發表出來，供大家研肘，較　了多數人的腦汁，加以不斷的研究實騐，才得完成偉績！可是國人只知自私自利，凡偶有所發明，必秘密得不使第二者知道，這是由於自古以來的政府無相當辦法獎勵發明者所致。是以發明者旣無法律的保陣，當然不肯公開發表。茲可舉例如左：</p>
<p>如拳敎師，有一百套拳頭，傳給他的得意門人，只九十九套，因恐全給他知道了，與自己本領相等。這樣個個人腦中存了此念，一代一代的徒子徒孫傳下去，越縮越少，結果就失了傳。醫學也是如此，所以沒有進步</p>
<p>（丁）同道間互相傾軋</p>
<p>這也是自私自利，爲名利問題，竟不惜破壤同道名譽，沒有互助精神，不互相聯絡，研討學術上的進展。竟以同行嫉妬爲能事，切磋的利益沒有了，醫學那裏還會進步。</p>
<p>明白了上述各點，略可窺見我國醫學不進步的原因，雖直接衰弱原因，由於帝國主義者的種種壓迫。要知道國能自强，帝國主義者常然亦不敢藐視而加以侵犯，例如日本在明治未維新以前，一切都幼稚，國家的衰弱，外侮的侵凌，正和現在我國相彷。維新以後，轉弱爲强，竟能一躍而爲世界頭等强國。僅就醫藥事業而論，在昔採取蘭醫，維新後廢蘭醫而研究新的進步的時代醫學，故已與世界各先進國並駕齊驅，此大和民族素性喜模仿的優點，這倒很値得驚佩的呀！</p>
<p>我們現在可知道，不隨世界潮流邁進，歷史已給我們深切底敎訓，並且事實上已經可以證明結果必致落伍，國家當就漸趨衰弱，甚而至於减種亡國，明乎此，足證國家之盛衰，在乎國民身體之健全與吾爲轉移。要使國民健全，全賴乎醫學智識的普及，務使人人了解普通所不可少的醫藥常識及應有的衛生知識。—這非有賴於衛生敎育的普及不可。是以我們中國要永遠適存於世界上，應盡量隨時研究世界現代醫學，務使醫學進展得與世界各先進國並駕齊驅，務使普遍到民間去，務使人人體强力健，國民個個至少對於國家有一點供獻，或做一番有益於國家的偉大事業。因體旣衰弱，精神同時萎靡不振，此類人，决不會成功偉大事業的。足證偉大事業的成就，全賴身體健全也明矣，其基礎還在於醫學的發達！</p>
<p>（戊）頑固與不知進取之弊</p>
<p>有些頑固者，斥研究泰西時代醫學的不是，這是不明世界潮流者的主觀見解。要知道學術無國界，他國之長，正可補我人之不足，前面已說過。總理云迎頭趕上世界一切進步的學術，俾不致使我國落伍，而結果達於沒落之途，眞是至理名言，如爲國家實利計：爲眞正的學術上的進展着想，中西醫應互想聯絡，團結一致，同在科學的信仰之下，共同研討學術上的進展，因科學在沒有進展到極端時，隨時在進展，隨時在發明，如以爲已往之學識已滿足，無改進之必要，故步自封，瞬間會就可使你落伍，落伍者，卽是沒落之先兆。我們要求學術上的進展，第一務求只知共然，不知其所以然的學說了然；無可了然的打破之，並發揮固有可以整理的材料，撮其精華，去其糟粕。也是應該經過的步驟。</p>
<p>爲國家實利計，爲人類永久幸福計，應當普及民衆醫藥衛生常識爲宗旨；集中國內醫藥人才，研究現代醫藥，完成中國醫學之獨立，並隨時促進中國醫學之進展。不但是要與世界各國的醫學並駕齊驅，也得要抱着宏願與世界各科學昌明的先進國家一樣，產生醫藥上的新發明。</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>因事實已瞪明：給時代開倒車的落伍者，或故步自封者，結果不爲人工所淘汰；將來必爲天然所淘汰—若油盞的被電燈所淘汰，已爲事實勝雄辯的鐵證。「宮室興而巢居廢，烹飪作而生食絕這是大家都知道的，正輿上例相同。茲更欲使頑固而不知時代潮流所趨的人們，爲促其覺悟起見，更進而言之，略述醫學史的起源及進展的動向於後，可使時代的進化與醫學的新趨勢進行，是無可抵抗的：</p>
<p>太古時代，人民思想簡單，知識幼稚，根本未知醫學究爲何物？遇有疾病，出乎先知先覺的理智本能來治療，所謂理智本能者，卽如犬戚到胃有不適時，能吃多量的草，以催起嘔吐；若猿猴能自己拔去身上的木刺或竹刺之類是也。——如遇有不能以理智本能來醫治的，只聽其自然而已！</p>
<p>因爲人類畢竟是有個較無論何種動物複雜而大的腦，故理智本能，自然較一切爲發達，故其後先知先覺的先哲們，以爲病是詫異的，定有神鬼妖魔在那兒作祟，於是凡遇敵人，他們便掌了兵器（按：那時的武器，不過是尖石所紮成之類，因那時人民思想幼稚一切都簡單故也。）在病者身上，臨空厮殺，以爲可把神鬼妖魔驅走，病者卽愈。——這種理想的療法仍不能醫治病人，於是他們又以爲神鬼妖魔比凡人利害，能戰勝一切，遂卽就向神鬼妖魔哀求，以便釋放病人，於是便生出祈禱一回事——正和泰西從前未達科學境界時的醫學相似，一切均操於僧人之手。——這種迷信舉動，現在中國大都市中，也還存在流行着，而一般無知愚民，還很信仰着。可見醫學內新趨勢，完全沒有普及於國家，眞是可嘆。</p>
<p>上述迷信舉動，仍不能醫治病人，於是先知先覺的神農氏發見本草能治病，經過他不斷地努力研究。以自己的身體做試騐品，據神話傳說，他嘗藥草嘗到第一百種。剛巧遇着能殺人的砒霜，就此犧牲了他的生命，眞是可惜！如那時他也懂得砒霜的成分，决不能就此完結了他的生命。且他旣是先知先覺的創造者，對於醫藥定還有不少的供獻，他是中醫界的鼻祖，現在的舊醫就肇端在此時。</p>
<p>其後又有不少的名醫若張仲景，扁鵲，華陀，葉天士，……等均給予中國醫學的進展，有很大的影響。</p>
<p>可是中國人只知墨守陳法，根本不知改良，不求進展，不知整理。不知迎合科學新趨勢，世界各國，却不斷地在那裏研究，改進，幷且時有發明，時有進展，致形成了我國現今醫學落伍的畸形。</p>
<p>在新的進步趨勢未產生以前，因無相當的來替代，一方面自然的趨勢，舊的落伍的，必歸淘汰，這是歷史上已給我們證明，無可諱言的，產生了更新的，那或許現在認爲新的進步的，也被牠淘汰都說不定，如此循環不息地在進展着，可見醫學趨勢也跟着國家進化一直到人類終了。</p>
<p>明乎此，足證時代的落伍者，遲早終有沒落的一天，淘汰的一天，爲謀醫學與世界各國並駕齊驅，站在同一水平綫上起見，願一切醫藥界同仁，應隨時隨着世界潮流，研究現代醫學爲謀舊醫界不被時代潮流所淘汰，永久幸福計，願舊醫界應該齊向科學大道上邁進，那才是國家的實益，不過新醫藥界方面，也有不良的近况，現把陳方之先生所說的話抄在下面，他說：</p>
<p>學術上討論，不是傾軋。</p>
<p>醫政上爭論，不是傾軋。</p>
<p>利用地位與勢力以圖消滅他人的事業，是傾軋。</p>
<p>今之執衛生行政者，也應當明瞭世界醫學趨勢，不可頑固的以爲學了那一國就是那一國可做模範，從他國學醫的都不行。這和國家進步都很有影響的。</p>
<p>綜上以觀，我們希望中國的醫學能够早日獨立，中國的醫學趨勢能够隨着新潮流而進展，一定可靠着我們醫藥界共同努力，决不是一部分崎形發展，就以爲是中國的醫學代表了，這種錯誤觀念要根本剷除，才是國家的福利，醫學有關國家的興衰，此種進展的趨勢，要有賴於醫界的團結才能共謀進步呢（完）</p>
<h3 id="c192">體溫之調節 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 郭人驥</p>
<p>體熱之放散　試比較身體的常溫與空氣的溫度之時，無論如何，必以空氣溫度爲低。是故吾人身體表面之熱，每繼續不絕的爲周圍所奪去。又在呼吸之際，吸入寒冷空氣而放出溫暖之空氣，亦使其熱得以放散於周圍者也。</p>
<p>體熱之發生　體內生活現象之施行，無時或息。心臟持續跳動，呼吸亦無休止之時。又在食時，消化器發起働作，且施行肌肉働作，此等一切動作之結果，皆發生熱。</p>
<p>體溫之調節熱之放散增加的時侯　熱發生於體內之方法，與熱放散於周回之程度，得能施行適宜之時，體溫恰成平溫。今因外氣已變寒冷，由體表呼吸之關係，體內之熱，過度發散於周回之時，則體溫有下降之虞。然在體內能造成多量的熱，以應付之。若其多量的熱，猝被周回奪去之時，身體內急須製熱之故，卽發超所謂惡寒戰慄是也。</p>
<p>又爲欲不使寒冷之外氣，奪去其體內之熱故，皮　血管，亦起收縮；皮膚成爲蒼白，且呈粟狀。</p>
<p>氣候與飮食欲在體內，造出過多之熱，則熱之材料，不可不取自多量之食物。是故秋風甫起，而氣候乍寒之際，胃口自能日趨佳良，且好攝取脂肪豐富之食物，因其能產出多熱之故也。</p>
<p>熱發生增加之時决言如因某種理由而熱發生於體內過多之時。能將其過多之熱，迅速放散於周圍，以防制體溫之昇高。例如施行長距離賽跑之時，因足部及全身肌肉發起運動之故，而產出過多之熱。爲迅速放散此熱於周圍起見　皮膚之血管擴張，而現潮紅，能自皮　迅速逸去其熱矣。又因不能迅速由皮膚表面放出水蒸汽之故，汗腺之工作特勤，遂至出干如珠矣。</p>
<p>呼吸之决數亦增加，呼出多量而溫暖之空氣及水蒸氣。又如犬樣，常伸出其舌於外方，蓋如犬類動物，因其體熱不易發散於皮膚之故，專恃呼吸以散其熱。試看犬在暑期，或在疾馳之後，每伸長其舌，藉以盛營其呼吸，卽所以增進熱之發散也。</p>
<p>以上皆爲溫血動物，使體溫保持同等程度之事。然此體溫調節，實由其腦中之溫熱中樞主持之也。</p>
<p>溫熱中樞　此溫熱中樞，在常態時，保持其體溫於平溫。然罹傳染病時，則因該病原菌的毒素，或其毒素的發生之産物，能令溫熱中樞陷於變態之故，體溫不成平溫，多變成高溫。然在後述稽留熱之時，此中樞亦能施行保持其體溫於高溫之調節者也。</p>

<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（七十八）梅毒對於鼻病之關係</p>
<p>鼻病中，有由梅毒而來的，稱爲鼻梅毒。鼻梅毒亦如一般梅毒的分爲三期。病變最著，危險最多的時期，就是在她的第三期。可以腐爛鼻骨，鼻背變爲陷塌。俗語所說的開天窗，也是發在第三期。現在且把三期的鼻梅毒，分述如右：</p>
<p>第一期鼻梅毒　由第一期鼻梅毒所生的初期硬結，普通是比較的少。外鼻的初期硬結，大都生在鼻孔部，形成淺表性潰瘍。邊緣多呈腫起硬結，底面平坦，有時侵蝕深部及表面。而於鼻粘膜的初期硬結，主在鼻中隔的前端，發生赤色的扁平隆起。這種隆起，容易變爲潰瘍，底面附着污穢黃色或黃白色豚脂樣物；且易出血，同時發生外鼻的腫脹與壓痛，並訴頭部及下眼窩部的放射性疼痛。附近顎下的淋巴腺，亦來腫脹，往往且有發熱等情。</p>
<p>第二期鼻梅毒　鼻粘膜的梅毒性丘疹，普通是少見的，多爲一種紅斑，粘膜呈潮紅色，多向一側，限局於前部。雖不呈劇烈的症候，但是牠的經過倒很長久的。至於在第二期梅毒所發生的扁平胼胝腫，則多生於外鼻的皮膚及鼻內。生在外鼻皮膚的時侯，則於鼻翼及鼻中隔皮膚部，屢屢發生帽針頭大隆起的斑點，呈銅紅色或褐赤色。上皮則一部剝脫，一部被以帶黃黑褐色的痂塊。生在鼻內的時候，則好發於鼻底及鼻中隔的前端，往往乳嘴過度增殖，鼻腔因之狹小，有時表面破潰，形成淺表性潰瘍。（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c194">牙齒常識問答（二十） <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— 林鑑賢</p>
<p>第六章　牙患的預防</p>
<p>第一節　概言</p>
<p>（第一〇二問）　牙患的預防，在齒科學上，很爲重視嗎？</p>
<p>答　是的。在從前時代，所謂齒科醫學，止限於修補的方面：專門注意怎樣去治療已經發生的牙患，恢復咀嚼的功能。但是現代齒科學的眼光，已經趨向於預防的一途，注意於牙齒的保護，蛀牙的防免，反把修補視爲决要了。其實，牙患若是能够防免，豈不是人類很大的幸福。我所以編這牙齒常識問答的意思，也就是要使得常人多些防護牙齒的知識罷了。</p>
<p>（第一〇三問）牙患確能够防免嗎？</p>
<p>答　在原則上，天賦給我們的牙齒，本來不應該早期損壞的。若是我們從小的時候，就過那合理的生活，用適當的方法來保護牙齒，不去糟蹋牠，那末，牙齒定可以維持牠天然的壽命。現在各國牙醫學界，孜孜研究的，就是要找尋這適當最有效的方法，能够防免牙齒的夭折，增進人類的口福</p>
<p>（第一〇四問）　牙息的預防，已到成功的地步嗎？</p>
<p>答　牙患預防的研究，雖然還不敢說是完全成功，但是我們能够照已經知道的各種方法，如下面幾節所述的，忠實地履行起來，許多的牙患，如蛀牙等，確可以免除或减少的。</p>
<p>第二節　兒童的口腔衛生和齒牙的防護</p>
<p>（第一〇五問）　預防牙患最要注意的是什麼？</p>
<p>答　最應注意是口腔衛生。因爲蛀牙是由於口內食屑微菌和酸質而起，所以欲防免牙患，首要注意口腔的淸潔，把殘留食物，洗刷凈盡，其次要設法消滅微菌，和制止酸質，同時還要顧到牙齒牙肉的磨練，這些都可算屬於口腔衛生範圍內的。</p>
<p>（第一〇六問）　口腔衛生的注意，應該從什麽時候開始？</p>
<p>答　從孩童時代，就應　始。若是孩童時代，乳牙保護得好，有了好的基礎，一生的牙齒就不容易損壤。而且刷牙等良好習慣，惟有從小時養成，方能行之不懈，終身受益。</p>

<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>除開上面所舉列的四種症象外，患者因盜汗過多，須採用止汗劑；貧血的患者則須採用砒鐵諸製劑；這也是緊要的對症療法之一，值得在此間一提的，關於對症療法的大概情形，已見於上面所述了！最後，作者還有幾句話要聲明的，就是：對症療法無疑地是一種暫時的姑息療法；肺結核症之痊愈，是完全仰仗此外的種種療法的。但是我們千萬不要因爲他祇有暫效，非根本辦法，而十分輕視：須知危險症象之解除或减輕，在臨床上還是狠重要的；像欬血一症象，卽完全視臨時處置之得當與吾而定的；其他種種也均抱有同感的。這是應該認識淸楚的。至於種種藥物之如何取捨，以及用量等情，這都是醫者本身事，讀老們無須詳曉的，所以此處也一概節去不談了！</p>

<h3 id="c216">去年對外貿易　（二續） <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— 汪警石</p>
<p>進口增加最鉅者　當推雜糧一項，計增二四，一七四，一八一元。其中大多由於上半年洋米進口所造成。蓋洋米一項竟佔二三，八七七，九〇八元，小麥則增三，〇一八，〇八三元，他如機器與工具亦增加六百五千餘萬元，但自上海進口者已形減少。至書織紙張等進口亦有三百五十餘萬元之增加，其中稍有變遷者，則以德，美，坎拿大等地輸入轉增耳。</p>
<h3 id="c217">出口貿易 <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>出口貿易計增加四〇，五九四，七八一元。其主要商品如油脂臘一項增加達二五，六一五，一四一元，紡織纖維二二，六三四，八七四元。子仁二一，〇六五，七八七元礦砂金屬一二，八三七，三六四元，雜糧等天，一九八，六〇〇元，動物及其産品二，三八九，二六七元，共計八七，七四一，〇三三元。其減退者，如疋頭一一，八六二，四五八元，紗線編織品之一一，，八六二，四五八元，茶減六，四七四，三六五元，生熟皮貨五，四七九，〇四〇元，雜貨四，六〇〇，四〇二元，其他紡織産品一，七二四，〇一八元，共計減少爲四二，〇六五，〇七二元。由上述減退數項中觀之，可知退者多屬工業製品，增加者爲農産品中之油類與子仁等而已也。再就油類而分析之，則桐油一項實增一千五百三十餘萬元，至美國者佔一千二百萬元。花生油亦較前年産六百五十餘萬元，美國亦佔五百萬元。棉子油增二百二十餘萬元，子仁增加則純係美國大師需要所造成。故其增加數額一千一百五十八萬元中，美國獨佔七百八十萬元這鉅，至紡織纖維中之棉花，我國出口已由前年之一千五百三　餘萬元增至二千一百七十餘萬元。其中以輸出日本達一千四百七十餘萬元爲最鉅，德國次之，亦達三百十七萬左右。此外如生絲之出口貿易亦有進展，廠絲已由前年之一千四百三一餘萬元，增至二千六百五千餘萬元，輸向美法兩國均見增加。金屬礦砂等類，則增加較爲普遍，其總額計增一千二百八十萬元。惟錫一項增加較大，約達六百餘萬元。錫米粒　有顯著之增加。雜糧一項增三百　十餘萬元，則純係朝鋪需要　粟轉旺，蓋往者刊印並不需要此類商品，即前年輸出該地者亦僅二，二四六元，去年忽一躍而爲三，三八〇，五三〇元頗足尋味也。再如動物産品等類，其中包括猪鬃，雞蛋家禽等品，輸出達八千餘萬，較前年亦增加二百九十萬元，向英美兩國出口皆有進展。</p>
<p>此外其減少出口者，如生熟皮貨達三百餘萬元，其輸往病因減少之數適與此數相彷，可知向美出口減退之烈。茶之出口，計減少六百四十餘萬元，中以英國低落三百八十餘萬元爲最鉅，蓋彼國沿有大量低廉之存茶，不甚需要華茶之輸入也。輸向蘇俄之茶，亦減少一百餘萬，惟摩洛哥則增加一百四十餘萬元。疋頭一項，減少一千一百餘虧邞，其中香港約少四百萬，關東租借地二百餘萬，朝鮮一百七十餘萬，及英屬東印度一百二十餘萬元之故。其餘從略。</p>
<h3 id="c218">貿易之動向 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>去年我國對外貿易，如以國別間分析之，則美國仍居首位，計貿易額達三萬一千一百三十四萬餘元，輸入值一萬七千餘萬元，其主要商品爲棉花，煤油，木材，汽車，鋼鐵，機器等。輸出爲一萬三千餘萬元，商品以桐油，子仁，猪鬃茶葉生絲等爲主要品。次之爲日本，總值爲二萬二千一百六十餘萬元，輸入以棉布，砂糖，鋼鐵，魚介海産品，人造絲等爲鉅，輸出則以棉花，礦砂，食糧，粉，蔴　之屬較多。英國佔第三位，貿易達一萬四千餘萬元，進口以機械，毛織品，染料顔料較多，輸出以蛋製品佔重要，猪鬃茶葉較次。德國以貿易值一萬三千二百餘萬元佔第四位，進口商品以鋼鐵，機械染料顔料，化學品等居多，此處尚須注意者，即德國進口值，實已駕乎英國之上，此後似有進佔第三位之望也。茲將主要貿易國擴所佔百分率列表於後：</p>
<p>國別　廿三年　廿四年　進出值（位單千元）</p>
<p>由美輸入　二六.一六　一八.九三　一七四、九三〇</p>
<p>向美輸出　一七.六三　二三.六七　一三六、四一〇</p>
<p>由日輸入　一二.二一　一五.〇三　一三六、四一〇</p>
<p>向日輸出　一五.一六　一四.二四　八二、〇五九</p>
<p>由英輸入　一二.〇〇　一〇.四八　九八、二三二</p>
<p>向英輸出　九.三〇　八.五八　四九、四六三</p>
<p>由德輸入　八.九九　一一.〇九　　一〇三、三八五</p>
<p>向德輸出　三.五八　五.〇二　二八、九二六</p>
<p>由香港輸入　二.八五　二.一七　二〇、三五九</p>
<p>向香港輸出　一八.八五　一六.四七　九四、八九三</p>
<p>由安南輸入　三.九七　六.七四　五九、九七三</p>
<p>向安南輸出　〇.八九　〇.九八　五、六四四</p>
<p>由法輸入　二.一六　一.四五　　一三、三六二</p>
<p>向法輸出　三.九五　五.〇七　一九、二四五</p>
<p>由澳洲輸入　一.〇六　四.一二　三七、〇四九</p>
<p>向澳洲輸出　〇.三〇　〇.四三　二、四六七</p>
<p>綜觀上述情形，去年我國以貿易，雖在極端困難，但較諸前年尚略見轉機，蓋進口品已漸減轉少，土貨出口略有增加，因之人超額降低，逆勢暫形和緩，此其一。輸入商品，機械金屬木材數值較大，且較前年尚有增加，足見我國國內建設事業，日有進展，此其二。凡此均需良好現象，足可自慰者也。惟我國出口增加者多屬原料品，工業品仍無起色，則我國依舊處於地位。而洋貨進口中，米糧輸入年複增加，則國內糧食自給問題，仍嚴懲，諸如上述各端，是我國對外雖云漸見轉機，吾人殊不足引以爲充分之樂觀也。欲求真正貿易之順利，除非努力於國民經濟之建設，以充實工商之基礎，再由政令實行編制貿易以保障國內産業，則貿易之前途庶有厚望焉。（完）</p>

<p>— 明月</p>
<p>諸葛亮，是我國的一位深入民間的歷史上的偉人，不論是黃毛孩子，白髪老媼，他們只消一提起「諸葛亮」三字，立刻會感動他們對於「禪機妙算」的異樣的興趣。在江浙兩省裏，還有一句普遍流行著的俗語，便是：「三個臭皮匠，合個諸葛亮。」并且對於諸葛亮是「那裏人，」也很少人會緾錯，因為諸葛亮字孔明，別說呌臥龍先生。在平劇空城計裏，又有一段「我本是臥龍圖...」的唱詞。臥龍圖在現今的湖北省襄陽縣束門外十五里，那裏並不是偏僻的地方，卻是很幽美的所在。山圖的形勢，雖不險峻，但很雄壯，地位也不怎樣廣大，很舒坦而已。這圖中有曲折的幽徑，和蔥秀的樹木，實是一處風景壯麗的勝境。圖上有亭一座，便是抱膝亭，亭後是武候廟，裏面供祀著諸葛亮的神像，有一個道士主持著司理香火事宜。廟裏藏有兩件古物，是一雙靴，和一雙鐵盂。到那裏去遊玩的，假使肯捨施一點香資的話，便可以要求道士拿出來鑒賞。靴是布料做的，可是比較尋常所見的靴大一倍多，那灰黑的顏色，確以是年深代久的古物了，據說：這是諸葛亮當時所著的靴。鐵孟的口差不多有一尺多寬，高大約八寸光景，據說：這是諸葛亮當時用以盛飯的。這些是否齊東野語，我非鑒古家，可不能斷定了。</p>
<h3 id="c221">十三號 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— 周賢</p>
<p>雖然說的十三是一個不詳之數，但是我的一位芳鄰「三十號」，卻是例外的特別地受人歡迎。</p>
<p>這位「十三號」的所以受人歡迎的原因，是十分簡單的，為的是一位女性，為的是一位年青的女性，為的是一位貌美而年青的女性，而且是一位某女校的高材生，同時，還是一位富商的唯一愛女。</p>
<p>這位姑娘的所以成名為十三號的原因，再也簡單不過的，為的是伊的公館是某路某里的三十號。所以當十三號在十幾歲左右時，好事者，便給伊起了一個別號，呌做「十三號」。後來，「十三號」逐漸地成長，十三號三字，逐漸地響亮，逐漸地掛上了弄中每一年青人的嘴上了。所以在前年，當十三號十五歲時，工部局重訂了門牌，把伊家的門牌，改成了五號，但是老門牌，雖已置不用，「十三號」，卻大有萬歲萬歲萬萬歲，與天地同不朽之概。</p>
<p>十三號的所以為十三號，已如上述，大致讀者，當已知其輪廓了。自然，十三號之所具的，是終年燙得鬆鬆，而波紋十分細緻的頭髪。彎彎的，像柳葉般的細眉。挺直的鼻子。長睫毛裏躲著的黑白分明的眼兒。像櫻桃也似的嘴唇。以及苗條的體軀，婀娜的姿態。總之，是夠得上現在所最摩登的「標準」二字。</p>
<p>十三號，不只是「秀外」，同時還是「慧中」。伊現在是一位高中學生，但卻已是一位候補的大學皇后了。伊的所以成為候補的大學皇后，倒也並不是因為美麗，而是用伊的學問，去博取得來的。因為伊在學校中。不只各項科目，都名列前芧，就是學校中的出版物上面，伊也是當時有佳作發表的。而且，還曾屢次的得到常說競賽，成績比賽等等的錦標。同時，伊還善唱英文歌，會跳一切古裝的跳舞。</p>
<p>不過！十三號，和普通的一般女子，却有一點不同凡俗的，那便是十三號雖然今年十七歲了，雖然有時也上交際場所去混混，可是說來真奇怪，伊除了正式的交際之外，却從沒有過一次秘密電話，更未有一封秘密信函。一言一語，一舉一動，都是絕對公開的。</p>
<p>因此伊雖有六偏磷酸钠，普货，一柜装25吨，天津至valpariso,chile请问整柜价格限重有「十三號」的別號，但是伊的名譽却真可說是白壁無瑕，一塵不染</p>

<p>第二十四回　利重美人輕傖夫割愛　志高雙足健壯士投荒</p>
<p>北海真覺得他這話過於露痕跡，在舉了筷子的時候，向他偷看著，只見他神色自若，筷子放到碗裏，慢慢兒的去挑撥著菜，左手扶了酒杯子，待舉不舉的，臉上只是推出笑容來。因笑道：我今天受了敝同宗之托，來接洽買賣的，這種開玩笑的話，留著交來有功夫的時候再談罷，買多才拿起酒壺，在各人本子裏，全斟了一遍，笑道：買賣得作笑話也得說這是沒有什麼關係的，我們談談買賣罷，我看你兩位氫要的價錢，老實說，恐怕不容易得著受主。於我們這裏呢，那可不同，是銀行投資，這一下投下去，因為辦商業，總是資本越大，掙扎的工夫越久，掙扎得越久，自然也就掙錢越多。他說到這裏，似乎很得意，只是搖頭晃腦，接著向下說。可是他儘管說了這樣一大段，北海還不知道，他什麼用意，只是喝酒吃菜，專聽他的。王寶藏更不會研究什麼經濟，現在聽他這樣發了一段子理論，他只是挺了胸坐著，用手扶著放倒的筷子頭，把筷子比齊來。或端著本子碰了嘴唇邊，微微呷著一點兒酒。買多才聽到人家全是靜靜的聽著，他又道：作生意的人，既是預備大量投資，只要辦的事是他所合意的，那自然就不會愛惜錢。所以你們這兩塊地皮，如果能夠買到我們手上來，你們所需要的價目，那總是好商量的。北海看到本子裏面，還有大半杯酒，於是端起來一飲而盡，笑道：我們若是把賈先生的話，照實的告訴了那一批賣主，恐怕他們不但不肯落價反而要漲價起來呢。賈多才將手上的筷子向桌上一按，微偏了身向北海望著道：這是什麼原故？北海笑道：一件破衣服，若是有兩個人搶著要，那衣服還得漲錢呢，何況是一塊地皮。賈多才道：二位王先生意思，是不願意賣給我們嘍？北海笑道：我們出賣地皮，只挑有錢的　兄　　　　,就賣給誰。（四○四）</p>

<h3 id="c224">蘇州的廢曆新年 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— 朱</p>
<p>光陰　水也般的流去，那廢曆新年，又眨眼過去。可是一年之中，在這時難年荒的時候，還是廢曆年頭最少見熱鬧，到處有著使人留戀的景象，來粉飾太平。現在且寫一些蘇州廢曆新年中的熱鬧情景，以見一斑。</p>
<h3 id="c225">門鳥 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>鳥類中，有一種喚做黃頭的小鳥，身體雖然比麻雀還小，可是同類相殘的本性。卻仿佛蟲類中的蟋蟀。一到廢曆歲首，那養鳥的人齊集在茶館裏，在靠著下班窗前，將一隻半桌，放在兩條長凳上，然後把兩隻黃頭鳥籠，合在一起，那兩隻小鳥，就在那面的三條竹梗上，飛鬥起來，往往鬥得毛羽紛落，兀是不可開交。戰勝的鳥，鳥籠上插著緞製的紙花，以示勝利。那種常勝的小鳥他的身價，最高的是可以　三四百元哩。</p>
<p>猴戲　「沐猴而冠」，猴子玩把戲，在我國是一種很早的獸戲。可是因玩猴戲的江北同胞，玩來玩去，祇有幾套老調，於是猴戲就成了落伍的娛樂，祇有在新年中出現，騙騙小孩了。這種猴戲，除了一隻主角穿著紅衣裳的猴子外，還有一隻叭兒狗和一隻老綿羊，做著配角。猴子玩兒的把戲，有帶假面具，翻跟斗，樹叉子，和掮著鞭子打轉等等。狗兒玩兒的把戲，有跳籐圖賽跑等等。猴狗玩完了，最後是壓軸戲，是猴子騎羊，玩把戲的人，將老綿羊牽到遠處，然後從羊奔馳，猴兒在羊奔馳的當兒，躍上羊背，像人騎馬一般，這般奔了三次，猴戲就完了。技術雖是簡單得很，然後偶然瞧，却也頗堪發嚱。</p>
<p>掉龍燈　在火樹銀花的元宵佳節，據說是民間的上燈時節，可是到了現在，花燈如畫的熱鬧情景，是久已瞧不見了。然而掉龍燈的玩意，到現在卻還有一二條點綴點綴。那種龍燈，是一節節用紗布糊著的，兩端裝著龍頭龍尾，在掉動的時候，掉燈人手段好的，真掉動的團轉如意，翻騰飛翔，真像活龍一般。那種龍燈在街上走著，前面打著鬧元宵，（羅鼓正在月裏敲打的，人名鬧元宵。）街上商店，見龍燈來了？有的燃放爆竹歡迎。龍燈見燃放爆竹，就停著舞掉，須俟人家爆竹放完，然後前進。所以燃放爆竹愈多，龍燈也掉得愈熱鬧，鑼鼓喧喧，爆竹聲聲，配著那一　飛舞的龍燈，點綴出元宵特殊風光。</p>
<p>文虎　文虎就是燈謎，是文人們猜度心思的文字遊戲。今年蘇州文虎，是特別的活躍，張燈微射共有兩處。一處是宮巷樂郡社，主辦的人，有願勁秋，程瞻廣等一班老先生雖然詩條深奧些，然而有幾種俗語，却頗為有趣。像「年紀輕輕收徒弟」，射「小人老頭」。「今歲運塘不景氣」，射「荷花大少」。裙下織織紅菱艷」，射「小腳色」。（吳諺小兒）一語破的，莫不發噱異常。尚有一處，則在舊學前民教館，但那裏所出謎語，都不大高明，如「不怕火燒」，射「鑊子」等。却很像小兒們猜的謎謎子了。</p>
<p>蘇州的新年景象，當然不止以上幾種。然而時代變易，除了元旦燒星宿香，吃元寶茶，和逛兀妙觀外。以前關門外一班公子哥兒挾了相好的妓女。坐著紥彩的馬車。在馬路上打轉奔馳的兜馬車，十年以前，大有車如流水馬如龍的熱鬧。但近年以來，化錢的少爺，既然太少，而妓女呢，公娼尚未實行，私娼又在嚴捕，這種兜馬車的風氣，已自行消滅。不過新年中的電影院，卻到處擁擠著大量的觀眾，熱鬧得異乎尋常，代替了當年的繁華景色。</p>

<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>上海的慈善家，到了每一個冬天，除了開辦庇寒所之外，照例還有施粥廠的開辦，這年頭當然照舊。閘北慈善團所辦的施粥廠，還是在柳瑩路，我特地在某一天起了個早，僱一輛人力車到柳瑩路去參觀，因為知道施粥時期規定每天上午七時至九時，去得遲了這幅動亂的流民團怕看不見。</p>
<p>真是嚇人呢，當都市裏的幸福者　躺在熱被裏做他們的甜夢，還不知天曉的當兒，柳營路上施粥廠的前面，已擠滿了無數的飢餓者　。就是不上萬吧，至少得有七八千人。老遠望去，衹見萬頭攢動，人聲鼎沸。這幫人的裏面，有男子，有女人，有老的，更有小的，每個人的手裏，捧著洋鐵罐，破臉盆這一類東西，預備盛粥的。</p>
<p>據說這些人，大都是隔晚三四點鍾就候在這兒的；因為遲了怕要不到粥，軋在前面，總可先進去，要了粥早些回出來，便不擔心事了。</p>
<p>施粥廠的裏面，放著幾隻大缸，埋在泥裏，米是整斛的倒在缸裏燒的。一面是進口，一面是出口，成人三勺，孩童二勺，進來的人，鐵罐和臉盆都是空的，可是出去的時候，這些東西裏面都盛滿了熱湯的白粥。每個人要到了粥，便會面露笑容的捧著出來，有的就坐在小路旁邊來不及的吃，有的一個不留意，盛粥的東西打翻了，會把雙手在地上捧起粥來，不管裏面已雜有泥鹽。</p>
<p>一批出來，另一批進去，要粥的人，不斷的接連著。據說每天平均要燒去三四千石米，這年頭施粥廠正和庇寒所一樣，也感到慈善家的減少，經費的缺乏，所以辦到幾時，誰也不敢確定，到了某一天捐來的錢用完了，就會停辦。這批飢餓　直要到施粥時期過去，才會散開，而第二天的早上，又會這樣的動亂一陣。</p>

<h3 id="c227">讀史有感 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— 周戈</p>
<p>自己也莫明其妙，近來對於讀歷史却感到非常的有興趣。薄薄的一本書里，從原始民族社會直到最近這個所謂資本主義社會，這一長段的史實，雖則簡略，然而却畢竟在我的眼前忽促地演映了一遍。</p>
<p>第一使我感到的，所謂歷史者，好像就是人類不斷的互相殺戮的寫實。在商業資本主義時代，殖民地上的土人的被殺戮，動輒以萬千數計。再進之，由商業資本主義進化上去，英國的「羊吃人」史實，再進之，法國一八四八年的所謂「育天的慘劇」，在　雅克的殘忍下，五天中殺戮人民有五萬之鉅。……使我感到人類之與禽獸，究竟共分別在哪兒？</p>
<p>第二使我感到的，就是每一决的大規模的殺戮，社會是畢竟是有了若干的進步了。血跟社會的演進是分不開來的，要求一社會的向前推進，要求人類的幸福更臻完備，捨血還有什麽呢？流一滴血，卽是社社會多前進一步，人類的幸福多完備一些。血的價値就在這里。</p>
<p>第三使我感到的，就是感到我們自己這個年代了。原來我們也在創造歷史，在將來的歷史上，殺戮的人數或許比過去「五萬」怕還要多上幾倍，一顆炸彈抛下來死個千百人不算希奇，毒瓦斯的殺人是更不可以言喩了。……這些雖然使我有點寒心，然而一想到後人讀起現在這一段歷史來的時候，也像我一樣感到「血與社會的進化以及人類的幸福的更臻完備」有關時，我也便欣然了。</p>
<p>是的，歷史所給予我們的命運是如此，然而相反，我們却在創造一個更加光榮的歷史呵！</p>
<h3 id="c228">溪尾之夜 <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— 耶戈</p>
<p>—漂泊散記之一</p>
<p>踏進溪尾市那單瘦的城樓，已近於蒼朦的黃昏了。</p>
<p>這個生長在僻壤地帶的山城，在我算不了怎樣陌生的，去年的春天，趕着一載洋貨上山頭，聽說接官亭發生了戰事，我曾在這兒逗留過個把星期。這城的面積怕還沒過三方里吧，却有東西南北四條尙稱不怎樣單調的街道，街中終年充塞着馬糞？死老鼠，肉骨頭以及一些令人一見便有不快之感的垃圾堆。</p>
<p>想起了去年在這兒逗留時，曾在鷄亭角底一家小客棧里住過夜，那是一對永春年靑夫婦開的，宿資便宜，招待又週到，何不再到那兒去投宿？於是，我便直望鷄亭角逕奔去。鷄亭角一切都如舊，只是那一家高懸着一塊用紅紙糊成，歪歪斜斜地寫着「大興棧」的客棧不見了，我心里狐疑着，以爲找錯了路，於是便跑了又跑地在街上徘徊着。</p>
<p>在一家瓦房子門口，我覺得有人遠遠地在我背後打招呼，忙轉過頭去，只見從一家掛着竹廉子的門上，一個梳高脚頭，穿黑褂袴的中年婦人，正笑迷迷的掀着竹簾子出來，柔細的問道：</p>
<p>「人客是找歇的嗎」？我點點頭，接着又聽她說「大興棧已經倒了好些時了，我們雖沒掛牌却也和他們一樣」！眼見暮意已經深了，又兼她們也還像是生理人家，於是，我便答應着跟她進去。</p>
<p>這是一間三進的瓦房子，顯然經久沒人走動所以現的這麼空寂。她把我帶進了一間客房後便推說下廚房去替我燒洗足水走了。從背上解下了包袱，又脫去足上那撲滿黃塵的草鞋，實在覺得自己也太疲乏了，躺在床上便覺有點朦朧的睡意。</p>
<p>這時夜色已變的濃了，灰暗充寨了空寂的週遭。突然我聽見一陣嬰兒疲憊的啼聲，從廚房里幽幽咽咽的透將過來，接下可聽見一陣乾咳和喃語，這使我感到恐怖久疑惑，便偸偸的從床上爬起來，透過那竹窗上的玻璃向外窺伺着，在謎般的朦朧中，我發見了一個全身蒼白的怪物在黑暗中蠕動，我底心坎是被一種恐怖的感覺所攫住而跳蕩着了。但當我仔細地注視着，便什麽都明白了。這時這個怪物已經漸漸地摸索着過來，拐杖在地底下敲擊着，響出了明析的響聲。終於他摸進我底房門，胆怯地用着柔細的聲音問道：「客人，呵貝娘還沒來這兒上火嗎？」我忙答應着說這倒沒有什麽關係，在黑暗中休息休息倒很合適的。</p>
<p>「她實在也太忙了，一個人要招待人客又要看顧病了的孩子；但是這有什麼辦法呢！從去年泉溪汽車路開後，我們便請不起夥計了。客人你當然知道：路過的客人那個不從大路走，又近又方便。只是苦了我們這些生理人，就說是鷄亭角那家「大興」客棧吧，便因爲沒生意維持不下倒的。……」老人說罷了話，輕輕的嘆息着，便沉默了。一會，他又從袋子裏摸索着，好久才掏出一盒自來火來，又吿訴我說要點燈，油燈就在床架上，我劃了根自來火照着把油燈找出來點上。火花微弱地逗動了一會，便慢慢的明亮起來。在這時我才知道他原來還是一個瞎子。</p>
<p>「老伯今年怕上了七吧」！我向他問道：</p>
<p>「上了七又有什麽用，人一老了便什麽都沒有，俗語說的好，破草鞋塞桌脚，破草鞋也有破草鞋的用處，只是一個殘廢的老人却什麽也沒用，一日三餐吃飽度死吧！……他很亢奮，語調裏激動他微顫着，兩隻盲眼便在燈光下霎動着。這時那個梳高脚頭的中年婦人，已經出來說水燒好了請我進去打洗。於是我便從包袱裏拿出雙布鞋來，跟她進去，老人坐在床沿上默思着。</p>
<p>當我洗好手足出來，老人已拄着拐杖從房裏摸索着出來了。夜半的時候，我忽然給一陣嘈聲吵醒了，仔細一聽才知道是從廚房裏吵出來的，有一個好像是那中年婦人的聲音在吼着：</p>
<p>「沒良心的鬼啊，你還想把它偸藏起來嗎？米明天沒有了，呵貝也得請醫生看」……</p>
<p>「呵貝的娘，包袱裏就只有這一點點的啊！……」老人膽怯地分辯着，接下便是一片啞默。</p>
<p>這使我從夢中驚醒過來，我想我是失竊了，便點着燈偸偸的從床上爬起來，打開包袱看，才知道那一包角子已經不見了。</p>
<p>好容易挨過了一夜，第二早我便提早着要走了，那個瞎子老人還特地拄着拐杖送出來，用親妮的口吻可嚀道：「客人下回路過，順便拐來坐坐！……」</p>

<p>— 郭卡</p>
<p>—靑島小景之一—</p>
<p>有一年夏天，被偶然的機會，我在靑島東鎭的一家工廠旁邊，避去了整夏的着天。在這里所以引用「避暑」這字眼，完全是因習慣上的聯想作用，因爲靑島這地方已和秦皇島北戴河一樣的和「避暑」這概念發生了特殊關係。不過如若說在靑島東鎭這地方避暑，未免被熟悉這地方的人覺得暗笑：因爲這地方完全在一些工廠大烟囱的蔭庇下，房屋矮小，空氣暄噪，而且住在這里的人也不見得會有「避暑」的好心情。</p>
<p>話說我住在這里，白天大半是在氣悶的小屋里，聽着附近一家啤酒工廠里轟轟轟大機器的吼鳴：晚上，一吃過晚飯以後，那時天氣常常會半明半黑，像蒙着一疋淡灰色的紗樣的，一切朦朧而安靜，這時便常常爲了吃過飯後肚子右點飽而到馬路上去蕩蕩。這算是一天夾最舒適的時間。</p>
<p>有一天晚上，和一個同住的朋友，無目的的在馬路上蕩着的時候，他忽然說道：</p>
<p>「走，我領你到一個新鮮地方去逛逛。」</p>
<p>「到那里去呢？」</p>
<p>「你先不用管，反正你還沒見過。」</p>
<p>我只有好奇的跟着他走，心里想：這麽一個工廠區，除了穿短衣的朋友，還是穿短衣的朋友，能有什麽新鮮玩藝呢？</p>
<p>在那電燈稀少，有點腥臭與汗臭的馬路上走了半天，結果到了一條用石子舖成的狹隘的街上街兩旁完全是矮小的平房，每一個門上挑着隻圓的門燈，每個燈上有個惹眼的小紅字：「三等樂戶」在燈下面，最初映在我眼里來的是一張粉白的臉孔，這臉子無論如何借着鉛粉的掩飾，也遮蓋不住那憔悴與衰老，高觀骨，尖下巴，看來有四十來歲了，見了人還笑呢，但那種笑是多麽可怕呵！在那黝黑的背影下，活像一個陰慘的鬼影！</p>
<p>我好奇的往前窺探着，每一盞燈底下都有些這樣的影子，有的是孤零零的一個，有的是四五個一堆；紅褲子，粉面孔，有的還像剛從鄉下來的小姑娘，網着脚，梳着條小辮子，在那陰慘的臉上也掛着個不自然的微笑。屋子里面有的黑漆漆的，有的還能從窗子里看到粉紅被褥的一角。</p>
<p>是的，除了可怕的成分是有相當誘惑性的！</p>
<p>那朋友悄悄的意味深長的說：</p>
<p>「就是這地方。沒來過吧？」</p>
<p>這地方我確實是頭一决來！街道汚穢而不平，一陣陣飄着不好聞的臭味，脚底下常常會踏到些發濕的東西。許多工人在到處遊蕩着，他們坦着胸，歪　着烟捲，眼晴斜斜的向兩邊瞥着。</p>
<p>在一家門前里，有一個中年以上的女人，—那大概是鴇母吧？—高身材，餅子臉，翹着一雙半尺多長的牛角樣的大脚，拍着一個工人的腦後勺喊道：</p>
<p>「哈孩子，你來了！」她接着又回過頭去，向那幾個妖怪樣的女人，喊着：「快，快！」</p>
<p>於是那工人便被蜂擁着退進那小屋去。</p>
<p>這一齣還沒有看完，那朋友忽然又撅了撅下巴說：</p>
<p>「你看！」</p>
<p>前面有一個十五六歲的小姑娘在忸怩的拉個工人的衣角，那工人正故意的逗着她調笑，旁邊有幾個人高呌着：　　　　「好呵！」</p>
<p>聽了這聲音，使人覺得悚然！</p>
<p>結果我們就帶着悚然的心情離開了那里。默默的走了一大段馬路以後，我才重新的問那朋友道：</p>
<p>「這呌什麼地方？」</p>
<p>「三等樂戶，—就是所說的（下三爛）呵呵！十幾個銅板可以喝喝茶，三幾角洋就能來一下。</p>
<p>一會兒他又說：</p>
<p>「你如果有勇氣，再一天我領你進去看看。」</p>
<p>我沒有回答他，我不知怎麼說好。</p>

<p>不是嗎？這世問値得我感激的，曾給了我無限溫情安慰的是這一枝筆了。自從我從一隻小長方形的盒子裏把它拿在手裏，我就看出它　分量，我的暗淡無光的生命也陡然豐富活躍起來。我帶着它，天南地北的飄蕩流徙中，從不使它有一朝一晚離開凌亂的書桌，讓它安安靜靜，帶着如火的熱情倒臥在那上面，伴着墨瓶的紙片，書冊，寂寞的歲月，哀樂的生涯。風雨深夜，哭笑之餘，它是如何率眞，溫婉，體貼，爲我寫出</p>

<p>我愛看和感動的說話　我能不感動嗎？這世問是沒有第二個人能像它這樣看待我的啊。</p>

<p>— 徐達</p>
<p>「爸爸，給我買一架紙燈吧，——花蝴蝶兒，比去年的要來得漂亮，又大；還有，還有一串百子鞭炮！……」</p>
<p>小囡瞧見爸爸路進了門檻，丟開了她的同伴阿根，一拐一拐地朝向她的爸爸走去，拉住爸爸的組糙的布棉短衣的衣角，楞住兩顆晶黑的眼珠子，口里不住地呢呢喃喃地嚷着。</p>
<p>之興伯歇下了肩上沉重的担子，在簷下的小櫈子上，坐下去，嘴巴大大地張開，露出幾個殘缺的牙齒來，呼呼地喘着氣；解開了布棉衣的鈕扣兒，扯下了頭頂上的破舊氈帽，匹匹地扇着，額角上濕潤潤的，滲出來無數沙粒也似的汗珠。</p>
<p>想起元宵節就在眼前，答應兒子阿囡的紙燈，該給他買一架吧。然而，……他瞧見兒子天眞的情態，心里萬分的難過，懺悔似的低垂着腦袋。</p>
<p>他的老婆從廚房里走出來，那雙尖細的小脚，彷彿支持不了身體的重量，走起路來，一拐一拐地很覺得吃力。她走到之興伯的面前，端詳着擺在他的脚邊的一担堆得滿滿的橙黃色的柑子，遲疑地問：</p>
<p>「不囡的爸，你怎麽還沒有去趕早市呢？……明天，明天就是元宵節啦！也許這兩天柑子的價錢會高貴一點哩！」聲音輕微得有點兒不自然，一字一字從口里緩吞吞輕輕地溜出。</p>
<p>之興伯的祖先傳下來的幾畝柑園，自此，之興伯就承繼先人遺留下來的產業，終年辛辛苦苦的種植着，每年一家的費用，自然就靠着這幾畝柑園的柑樹結下來的果子了。當每年冬天的時候，柑園里的柑子，累累地，靑綠綠地掛滿了枝頭，那時，之興伯瞧見這些累累而又靑綠的柑子，總是像養了兒子般的高興與快活！同時，他却又恐怕有小偸在黑夜里會閃進園里來偸採他的柑子，於是，在這個「柑冬」的時期，他吃過了晚飯之後，放下飯碗，胡亂地抹一下嘴角，就迅速地獨個兒跑到園里來守夜，不管霜露風雨抖擻着精神，深夜里一個人踽踽凉凉地肩着扁担在園里穿來穿去地逡巡着，允其是年將殘了至元宵節這個相子熟了的時候，他防守得連睡眠也都忘記了。</p>
<p>往年，這個時候，特別是元宵節，柑價高貴，他總有一筆巨欵的收入，彌補「柑冬」過後的空閒的日子的家用。</p>
<p>「怎麼沒有去趕早市呢？咳，咳，…」掃淸了喉喻之後，從腰帶問抽出旱烟筒來，裝上一筒烟絲，燃起火柴，嗤嗤地抽着，鼻孔里噴出來兩股悠悠的靑烟，又繼績地說：「今年的柑情可不行了，一祖柑子要捐一塊多錢的捐稅，自然，「羊毛出在羊身上，」柑價也只好提高了　可是，今年的市上却來了許多台灣柑，這些相彷彿魔鬼似的！据說用不着抽捐稅而能通行各地。雖然它的柑汁比不及我門的，可是，表面的顏色與形狀却比我們的漂亮得多，而且價錢又便宜，這一來，我們的相子怎麼不受打擊呢！橫豎正月里人們的購買柑子，　不過是送送親戚朋友，點綴故事吧了！……唉！今年的柑情，那可完了！……」</p>
<p>太陽光給一朶黑雲遮住了，屋簷下現出一片陰影，灰暗暗地。</p>
<p>「爸爸，給我買一架紙燈吧，又大，又漂亮；還有一串百子鞭炮！」小囡又拉着爸爸的衣角，咕嚕起來。</p>
<p>「鬼東西，吵什麽！」媽在她的腦袋上恨恨地敲着。</p>
<p>之興伯緩緩地站起來，走到神龕後拿出來去年買的紙燈，用氈帽拂掉了上面的灰塵，說：「小囡，爸貝花色紙條給你重新做一隻吧。」</p>

<p>— 華</p>
<p>從西貢到了宅郡，已經是黃昏的時候了。</p>
<p>宅郡是安南一個小鎭。看慣了西貢市上那繁華街景，宅郡的風光在我們看來實在是太樸素，太寒傖了，道旁一排像合歡一樣的樹木，長長的枝枒無力地搖擺着，送來了一陣陣南國特有的倦人的熱氣。我們兩個人像剛從水裏爬上來的一般，渾身浸透着汗水。</p>
<p>這同伴是一位商人，離開唐由已經十八年了。他是一個相信命運的人，一個道地的宿命論者。在命運之神的惡意的播弄之下，這麽十幾年來，他始終結貧窮同苦難的重壓弄得喘不過氣來，據說當新嘉坡的樹膠園正在獲利的時節，他亦曾發了一筆小財，但終究賭輸了，因爲他是相信命運的，所以有一個「冬」，一個「仙」或多至是一「撥」（他到過暹羅同新嘉坡），他終是要上賭塲去的。在異國的長長的旅途上，有他作伴，我實在减去了非常寂寞同麻煩。我們是在西貢一家批局結識的。</p>
<p>現在他正從頭上脫下那頂寬邊的大草帽來，不斷地扇着扇着，一排排的汗水從帽邊飛了下來，草帽的黑綢邊亦滲透冷汗，有地方因烈日晒乾了，浮上一彎彎白色的鹽灰。</p>
<p>「得歇歇了。這天氣，沒有發「黑狗痧」眞造化，你說，是不是？」他說</p>
<p>我點了點頭。街上稀落地沒有多少行人。許多赤裸着上身的女人坐在屋門外乘凉，一排排汗珠像黃豆一般從那驚黑的背上滲出來。一個賣冰霜的小商人帶着那個高筐子蹲在路旁，已經昏昏睡去了。當我走過他身旁，才看見他遍身淋濕，一條長長的口涎從他嘴角拖了下來。那些黑臉厚嘴唇的土生小孩，雙手按着凸出的肚皮，驚詫異拉着他們媽媽的裙角，一面注視着我們，一面打着只有三成純熟的潮州人向我們說：</p>

<p>三月春風花正紅。百花舞影月如弓。我是，慢步花聞月影下。又過月橋花徑通。但是，月轉東牆花影亂。花開北苑月華溶。雲破月窺花好處。夜深睡月明中。猛相逢，月裏嫦娥離花國。花間柚子出月宮。我愛她，多情月照花間露。解語花搖月下風。我愛她，月精神。花模樣。月色花香一般同。我們是，把酒花前返月魄。徵歌月下對花容。月中慢擊催花鼓。花下輕彈射月弓。月落且憑花送酒。花殘猶有月催妝。實指望，月圓花好長不散。誰知道，月缺花殘太可傷。從此，春花秋月無窮恨。秋月春花恨不窮。最難忘，明月梅花眠芳月樣潔。月似精神花似容。到而今，花落已隨月波去。月殘猶在花紅中。自古來，鏡花水月一般總成空。</p>

<p>但是真的要決鬥時，他又因為她的媚人的雙眼和美麗臉上的笑窩，把怒氣和勇敢都奪了去，自然的軟化下來了，反而跪在她面前白她求婚，雖然她決意要為丈夫終一等一！最後還說出　　定吧!　這樣的矛盾著！</p>

<p>Tianjin - Lieutenant Colonel Ikeda, Staff Officer of the Japanese Garrison in North China, and a person named Jūrokuyoi, returned to Tianjin on the 16th after concluding negotiations in Tokyo regarding the expansion of the North China Garrison. The Japanese military's plan to strengthen its forces in North China has been largely decided. The number of new troops will be one mixed brigade, which is more than two and a half times the current number of troops. It will be accompanied by special army and air force units. After implementation, the total number of troops stationed in North China will be over 8,000. The commander will be replaced by a lieutenant general. This is expected to be realized in April or May. The Chief of Staff Headquarters, Sugiyama, is scheduled to arrive in Tianjin next week to convene a meeting to finalize the details and make the final arrangements. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Tianjin - Starting from the 15th, the puppet police forces in Shanhaiguan, Yingkou, and Gubeikou have reimposed restrictions on laborers going abroad. When the puppet Datong Company sells permits, Japanese military police monitor and interrogate laborers very closely, and many laborers are prevented from leaving customs. The reason is that conflicts are raging along the puppet Mongolian border, and war rumors are rampant. The Japanese and puppet regimes fear that righteous volunteers will mix in and go outside the customs to increase their strength. Currently, hundreds of passengers are being prevented from leaving customs at Yuguan. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Tianjin - With the escalation of disturbances along the puppet Mongolian border, drastic changes are occurring in the financial and economic sectors within the puppet territory.

Therefore, starting from the 14th, it has promulgated eleven articles of financial control measures. Anyone in the Northeast who remits money to relatives and shops inside the customs must obtain a certificate issued by the local police station. Each private remittance shall not exceed 200 yuan, and each business shall not exceed 1,000 yuan. Remittances are limited to one per month. Businesses are specially allowed to purchase goods from Japan, and there are no restrictions on remittances. The people and merchants are complaining bitterly. The puppet Ministry of Military and Political Affairs has also issued an order to control food and flour, prohibiting exports, in order to maintain the food supply for the people and military in the puppet area in case of emergency. There is unrest everywhere. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>

Each unit was exceptionally brave, vying to be the first to attack fiercely. Everything they encountered was captured.

<h3 id="e9">Doihara's Statement to European and American Reporters in Beijing <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>All Aspects Have Been Progressing Steadily Since the Establishment of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council; He Claims to Strive for the Happiness of Eastern People Based on Culture; The Expansion of the Japanese Garrison Is to Protect Overseas Chinese and Not for the Purpose of Invading North China; If the Communists Run Rampant, He Will Assist the Chinese Authorities in Suppressing Them</p>
<p>Beijing - Doihara met with European and American reporters in the office of the Japanese military attaché this afternoon. Japanese military officer Imai was also present. Doihara said that since the establishment of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, everything has been progressing steadily, and it is expected that the administration of Hebei and Chahar will gradually become clearer. European and American reporters asked about the matter of hiring Japanese advisors for the Political Council. Doihara said that the news report stating that Mr. Ishino and Mr. Kiyoki were hired as advisors to the council, and that I will be hired as a senior advisor, is not true. The reporter further asked if his visit here meant that he advocated force and rejected Europe and the United States. Doihara said that he is here in a personal capacity. He has never advocated "Asia for Asians." His concept is based on culture and strives for the peace and happiness of the people of the East. The local authorities in North China have been able to understand his concept. He had no opportunity to meet with President Chiang. When he met with Wang Jingwei last year, he gained a good understanding of him. The reporter asked what the purpose of the expansion of the Japanese garrison in North China was. Doihara said that there is no news about this yet, and he does not know the number of people to be increased. According to what I think, the number of increases will not be too much. The purpose is not to invade North China, but to protect the lives and property of Japanese residents. The reporter asked if this kind of protection was necessary. Doihara said that because the number of Japanese people coming to North China is increasing day by day, it is necessary to have a considerable force to protect them. Some people suspect that this is for the purpose of invading North China, which is a mistaken notion. The reporter asked about the incident in Chahar Province. Doihara said that Li Shouxin is not a "Manchukuo" army, but a Mongolian army. The reporter also mentioned that since Li's army does not belong to Manchukuo, why does it fly the Manchukuo flag and wear Manchukuo military uniforms? Doihara did not answer. The reporter asked about rumors that Puyi will come to Beijing in March. Doihara laughed loudly and said that there is no such thing. The reporter asked about the Russian-Manchukuo border issue. It is said that I know that Russia has no intention of occupying Manchuria, and that there will not be any major incidents in that area. However, the border should be demarcated clearly, as should the border between Chahar Province and Outer Mongolia. However, there is no such urgency as before at the moment. The reporter asked about the issue of anti-communism. Doihara said that the Japanese authorities will certainly assist the Chinese authorities in suppressing the Communists. The reporter asked if he had heard that the Communists in Suiyuan and southern Hebei had plans for uprisings. Wang said that the situation is not that serious. If that is the case, the Japanese military authorities will certainly come forward to assist the Chinese local authorities in suppressing them. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beijing - When Doihara met with foreign news reporters today, I recognized the Japanese Monroe Doctrine. He said that my views are not based on exclusivism. I do not advocate that Asia should be exclusively for Asians, nor do I advocate political or racial self-determination movements. Doihara also said that he knows that the Japanese army in North China will increase, but not greatly. Its purpose is to protect North China, not to occupy it. It seems that some people are worried that the Japanese will invade and occupy North China, but this worry is based on mistaken notions. Doihara continued to talk about the Communist Party, saying that if the Communist movement in Hebei Province develops seriously and the Political Affairs Council is not strong enough to stop it, the Japanese army will take it as its responsibility to assist the Political Affairs Council in suppressing communism.

<h3 id="e11">Public Opinion and Diplomacy <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— Star</p>
<p>Recently, one of our country's ambassadors to foreign countries gave a speech on diplomatic issues in the capital before leaving the country. He had many feelings about the past failures of our country's diplomacy. He said that in the past, diplomacy often relied on impulsive emotions and failed to observe the actual international situation, thus missing opportunities. It was too late to regret. The most obvious example is the Paris Peace Conference. The powers had already intended to return extraterritoriality after five years. The people of our country insisted on immediately recovering extraterritoriality, even thinking that a three-year period was too long. To this day, extraterritoriality has not been recovered. This was a missed opportunity at the Paris Peace Conference. During the Washington Conference, the recovery of the Jiaoji Railway was the key to all other negotiations. The representative had already expressed considerable concessions, such as employing Chinese people as the chief accountants of the railway and using Japanese people as assistants. At that time, the Chinese delegation was surrounded by popular groups. The people's intention was to advocate the complete recovery of the railway. The delegation had no choice but to reject Japan's concessions. The Japanese representative thought that nothing could be done and became tougher. After mediation by Britain and the United States, a compromise was finally reached with the decision that Japanese people would be the principals and Chinese people would be the assistants. This is an example of being clever but making a mess of things at the Washington Conference. After the September 18th Incident, the public's outcry against direct negotiations in our country was very high. The government also did not understand the content of the League of Nations and wanted a third party to mediate. As a result, the third party was unable to do anything, and Japan's aggression became insatiable. If the opportunity had been used well at that time, the enemy's internal invasion might not have reached this point. He said that the diplomacy of a weak country should assess the internal and external situation and weigh the actual situation of both sides. It is commendable to achieve 75% of the success out of an 80% possibility. Outstanding issues should be resolved as soon as possible because the more outstanding issues there are, the more unfavorable it is to a weak country.</p>
<p>According to his view, the performance of the public's opinion in diplomatic issues in the past has not met our ideals in terms of quality and quantity. The public still lacks an understanding of the actual needs of diplomacy, causing diplomats to miss opportunities and the country to suffer losses. However, although public opinion has its shortcomings in quality, we can never conclude that public opinion has exceeded the necessary level in quantity. The failure of our country's diplomacy in the past was due on the one hand to the fact that the people and the government had not yet reached a consistent point, and on the other hand to the fact that the public opinion backing the government was not sufficient in quantity. If there were sufficient public opinion, and this public opinion were expressed in the most precise direction and in the most appropriate way, the diplomatic situation might not have been like this. The reasons why the expression of public opinion in the past did not meet the ideal and its strength was not sufficient and great are as follows: the people are not interested in diplomatic issues; the people's judgment on diplomatic issues is too emotional; the people know little or nothing about the actual diplomatic process and the real situation of the environment; those who lead public opinion have no consistent attitude and no common belief. The government should bear the majority of the responsibility for these reasons. The formation of public opinion depends on accurate understanding as a condition. The government's diplomatic process is secretive, and news censorship is meticulous. The public is blind, and the agitation of their patriotic emotions cannot be expressed in a rational way, but rather in an emotional way. Moreover, a large number of people have no way of knowing the actual situation and therefore adopt an attitude of indifference to national affairs. The disaster of national subjugation is imminent, but they are still indifferent. The opinion leaders who lead public opinion cannot fulfill their responsibility to guide the people and to back the government's diplomacy because they do not know the truth and are afraid to express their opinions. Under these circumstances, it is difficult for public opinion to be precise in quality and sufficient in quantity.</p>
<p>Therefore, we believe that the diplomacy of a weak country is bound to fail without the backing of precise and sufficient public opinion. As the ambassador said, the inaccuracy of public opinion in the past is true. The inadequacy of public opinion in the past is even more worthy of our attention. What we hope from the government is to lift the restrictions on freedom of speech and to make diplomatic processes open to the public as much as possible. What we hope from the people is to increase their interest in diplomatic issues and pay close attention to them, using reason as the criterion for judgment and facts as the basis for right and wrong. The press can then fulfill its natural responsibility, and diplomats can also reduce difficulties.</p>

<p>Nanjing - Vice Chairman Chiang delivered a speech at the Central Party Headquarters Memorial Week on the morning of the 17th, entitled "Methods to Improve Work Efficiency." The original text is as follows: Fellow comrades, Mr. Ye Chucang just gave a report on recent party affairs, and finally emphasized the two points of "management" and "performance appraisal." I feel that if these two points can be done effectively, they will be very important for the future work efficiency and factual development of our party headquarters and general party members. Therefore, after Mr. Ye's report, I will briefly report a few of my personal opinions to everyone. Everyone often feels that our party has no spirit, only a shell, and is not an ideal revolutionary party. Therefore, all work cannot be promoted according to our plan. Why is this happening? Chinese people are people, and foreigners are also people. Why can foreigners organize a party that is spirited and persevering, while our party, although its spirit is good at first, inevitably becomes lax and disorganized later? I think the biggest reason is that our general superiors and comrades who have leadership responsibilities, from committee members and ministers to section chiefs and section leaders, have not fulfilled their responsibilities. They have not paid attention to training their subordinates, or the training is not effective. We must know that whether it is party affairs, politics, or military affairs, they can only be promoted smoothly if our general supervisors and officials can not only know people and be good at their jobs, but also train their subordinates at any time to cultivate talents. Therefore, superiors should not only direct their subordinates to do things, but also train them so that their knowledge, talents, spirit, and character can continue to improve. They must also increase their experience and ability in personnel management, that is, supervising, directing, and teaching subordinates, as well as the general public, so that all work can not only be gradually promoted, but also always have suitable talents who can continue to be responsible for it. The general situation now is that this point is not fully achieved, so our party cannot be spirited and quickly promote various revolutionary tasks. We learn from the past and hope that the general comrades who bear the responsibility of supervision will pay special attention to training their subordinates in the future. Of course, if we want to train people, we must first train ourselves. We must also be able to supervise ourselves before we can supervise others. If we want to fulfill the responsibility of superiors to train subordinates, we must first be able to lead by example in everything. At the same time, the general comrades who handle affairs must also be aware, automatically invigorate their spirits, and strive for progress. Everyone must recognize that our office is a school, and the superiors are the teachers in this school, and the general subordinates are the students. We must all, from top to bottom, be based on the principle of "organizing schools" and "work educating," and strive together. Then, the efficiency of handling affairs can be greatly improved, and the "management" that Mr. Ye just mentioned can be said to be done perfectly. Finally, as Mr. Ye has already mentioned, "performance appraisal" is the most important thing to improve work efficiency and train subordinates. However, in order for performance appraisal to achieve satisfactory results, it must be able to use reasonable and practical methods. This method must of course be studied and determined according to the situation of each agency and the work of each person, and cannot be generalized. However, there is one point that I think is very important: whether we train or evaluate our subordinates, it is best to call each of them to draft plans to promote work or solve problems within the scope of their responsibilities or for practical problems directly related to their responsibilities. Moreover, for each matter or each problem, it is best to predetermine a variety of different plans based on various possible situations, rather than just one plan. In this way, first, it can enable general subordinates to often exert their intelligence and talents to plan their own work and deal with current problems, so as to cultivate their thorough thinking, automatic spirit, and creative ability, and achieve our goal of training subordinates and cultivating talents. Second, by reviewing the plans they have drafted, we can know how smart and talented each subordinate is, how much experience and knowledge they have, and we can also recognize their thoughts, spirit, and even character. This is the most reasonable and practical method of performance appraisal. Third, it is necessary for us to do things well to establish more plans, because as a result of modern science and civilization progress, all aspects of society are unusually complex and constantly changing. It can be said that there is no one thing or one problem that can be done well by only determining one fixed situation and preparing a rigid plan. Therefore, in order to be able to do things well now, we must first study in detail the relationship between the things we do and all aspects of things, and then predict various possible situations and formulate various practical plans. Then, we can use the most appropriate plan at any time according to the actual situation. For example, if this matter encounters the first situation, we will use the first plan. If it is the second situation, we will use the second plan. It can also be said that if the first plan does not work for us to do this matter, we will use the second plan. If the second plan does not work, we will take out the third plan, and so on. In general, we must use the most appropriate plan to achieve the greatest effect and achieve the greatest success. The meaning of the above is that the first point is to pay attention to training subordinates, and the second point is to be able to establish more plans in handling affairs. I think these two points are the most important methods for us to improve work efficiency and exert revolutionary power in the future. Therefore, I have specially brought them up today to report to you. (17th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e45">Current Situation of Japanese Elections - All Parties Adopt a Cautious Attitude <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo: The Okada Cabinet policy presentation lecture, hosted by the government, is scheduled to be held at Hibiya Public Hall at 3:00 PM on the 17th. After the opening announcement by Director-General of Books Shirogane, Finance Minister Takahashi will speak on the current cabinet's financial policy. Next, Prime Minister Okada will explain the reasons for dissolving the parliament and the current cabinet's policies. This time, the government abandoned the traditional "national unity," so its impact on the political situation will inevitably be significant.</p>
<p>Tokyo: On this day of intense general election battle, the leaders of all political parties are concerned about the political situation and the election status in various regions. The presidents or secretary-generals of the various political parties made statements on the 16th, expressing their beliefs. The contents are as follows:</p>
<p>Seiyukai (Friends of Politics Association): Prime Minister Okada gave a policy speech in the parliament, but the government's attitude has always been inconsistent. Therefore, the Prime Minister had no choice but to hold a lecture at Hibiya Public Hall on the 17th. The general election situation is unfavorable to the government party. Therefore, this measure was taken. However, the Seiyukai will not be affected by this in any way. We firmly believe that the victory of this Friends of Politics Association is certain. The day the government resigns is already imminent.</p>
<p>Minseitō (Constitutional Democratic Party): After the start of the general election campaign, the Minseitō has been actively investigating the party's situation and working hard to establish new candidates, which has been successful. The party has always expanded its efforts through speech and debate and has never relied on power. Therefore, the more fair the election, the more it will benefit the party. According to the current situation, there are 190 people who can be regarded as definitely elected and 40 to 50 people who have a chance of being elected. In the next few days, we must focus all our efforts on the war of words, so that the people can understand the party's attitude and policies towards overcoming this extraordinary time, then we will surely win.</p>
<p>Kokumin Domei (National League): The party has only nominated 35 candidates, but because they were carefully selected by the party headquarters, the election of all candidates is almost certain. Unlike the mess of the two major parties, the victory or defeat of the A party or the B party in today's political situation is not of great importance.</p>
<p>Shōwakai (Showa Society): The party has 48 officially recognized candidates. Although it is not allowed to prejudge the election results, the public's fair criticism will surely support the Showa Society's legitimate claims.</p>
<p>Shakai Taishūtō (Socialist People's Party): Clean elections are quite beneficial to the proletariat party. There will be no abuses such as bribery or abuse of power in the future. The advancement of the proletariat party in this election campaign is noteworthy.</p>
<p>Tokyo: The general election battle is now in full swing. 878 candidates are vying for election under various pressures. The situation is chaotic. Yesterday, those who were said to have the advantage are today reported to be at a disadvantage. According to the estimated number of elected candidates by various factions on the 17th, the Seiyukai is at 162, the Minseitō is at 153, the Showakai is at 16, the Kokumin Domei is at 11, the Socialist People's Party is at 7, and the neutrals are at 7.

One demonstrator was killed and three were injured. Two members of the security forces were also injured. The cabinet then held a meeting to prepare for the incident. Prime Minister Valladares ordered the commander of the capital's garrison to maintain order. In addition, the General Confederation of Labor issued a statement urging all workers to remain calm and resume work at 1:00 PM. (17th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>◎ Madrid: Although five people died and forty-five were injured in this year's parliamentary elections, the authorities claimed that this was the most peaceful election. Although the results of the election are not yet fully known, the conservative Central Party, which currently controls the government, and the left-wing parties will likely achieve a reliable victory. However, in Catalonia, the Socialist Party achieved a major victory. Companys, Borralleras, Gassol, and Estev, who participated in the October 24th rebellion and are currently in prison, are among those elected. (16th Guomin News dispatch)</p>
<p>◎ Madrid: The specially mobilized police today actually defied orders and joined the Communist Party, shouting for amnesty for political prisoners. The government recognizes that the left-wing party, the Popular Front, has indeed secured a majority of votes in Madrid and Catalonia. (17th Reuter dispatch)</p>

<p>◎ Madrid: Prime Minister Valladares has announced that the government has declared a state of alert for eight days to maintain order. The press censorship system has also been restored. All political gatherings will be controlled by local authorities. The Prime Minister also said that although the will of the people should be respected, peace and order must also be intact.

<p>◎ Madrid: It is rumored that labor groups will implement a general strike within 24 hours to demand that the government immediately issue an amnesty order and release political prisoners. This morning at 11:00 AM, several thousand people gathered in the working-class district of the city, the Chamartín de la Rosa district, and marched towards the city center, shouting "Long live the Republic" and singing the Internationale. Demonstrators held up banners demanding amnesty for social and political prisoners. Many workers stopped working along the way and joined the march. The whole city was very disturbed, but it is generally believed that the government has instructed the police not to interfere with the demonstrations unless they become serious.

<p>◎Madrid: The results of the House of Representatives elections as of now show the following number of seats won by each party: 120 seats for the right-wing Popular Action party led by former Minister of War Robles; 12 seats for the Agrarian Party; 2 seats for the Liberal Democratic Party; 34 seats for the Royalist Party; 2 seats for the Conservative Republican Party; 7 seats for the Catalan Autonomy Party; 16 seats for the Central Party; 16 seats for the Basque Nationalist Party (without affiliations); 10 seats for the Radical Party; and 200 seats for the Socialist Party, Republican Union Party, and Left Republican Party belonging to the left-wing Popular Front. Other parties won 5 seats. The total number of seats accounted for is 424, with 49 seats remaining undeclared. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>◎Madrid: Since the establishment of the Spanish Republic in 1931, the third parliamentary election was held today. Armored vehicles patrolled the streets of major cities and towns, and troops were stationed in camps in preparation for incidents. However, everything went relatively smoothly. The most significant event today was the conflict between the left-wing party and the opposition, resulting in three deaths on the left-wing side. The full election results will be known three days later. Both major parties, the left and the right, are currently claiming victory. It is estimated that the right-wing party may win a majority, but only by about thirty seats. Therefore, the power will be in the hands of the Prime Minister and the leader of the Central Party, Beigbeder. The authorities prohibited radio propaganda speeches and adopted other strict measures, so the election did not experience serious disturbances. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>◎Madrid: The results of the counting of votes in the province of Catalonia in the House of Representatives elections show a major victory for the left-wing. The Governor of the province, Escalar, has already submitted his resignation. The Secretary of the Prime Minister, Valladares, issued a report via radio broadcast at 10:20 p.m., stating that the left-wing parties have achieved a major victory in Catalonia, which is the most noteworthy fact of today's election. It is noted that Catalonia is an autonomous province, and all political affairs, except for public security issues which are managed by the central government, are handled by the provincial government. Now that the left-wing has won, the autonomous nature will inevitably become more pronounced, which is a major problem for the central government. This is the reason why the Governor of the province, Escalar, submitted his resignation, and it was accepted by the Prime Minister Valladares. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>◎Madrid: The left-wing parties achieved a major victory in yesterday's House of Representatives elections, as reported in a separate dispatch. It is now learned that the Minister of Public Works in the current cabinet, Del Rio, has been defeated. Prime Minister Valladares is also likely to fail. Although the vote counting in his constituency has not yet been completed as of the time of this dispatch, Valladares has only received 667 votes, while his political opponent among the left-wing candidates has already received 3,000 votes. In addition, the Minister of Labor and Justice, Piñeiro, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ussel, and the Minister of Education, Villalobos, are likely to be elected. The national election situation yesterday was very calm. Only in some places did the left and right wings hold demonstrations, with occasional disturbances, but they were immediately quelled, and the situation was not serious. Only in the cities of Zaragoza and La Coruña did one person die in each city. In the capital, various groups belonging to the left-wing Popular Front began demonstrations in the early morning, marching in formation to the Plaza de Toros de Bilbao area, attempting to overthrow the billboards erected by the counter-revolutionary group, i.e., the far-right Popular Action party. It is said that the leaders of the right-wing and central parties, especially the Popular Action party and the Royalist party, are all unhappy because the victory belongs to the left-wing. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>◎Madrid: In this election for the House of Representatives, the left-wing parties formed a joint front called the "Popular Front" to compete with the right-wing. According to a government bulletin, out of the 473 seats in the House of Representatives, the results are known for 420 seats. The left-wing has 225 seats, the right-wing has 135 seats, and the central parties have 60 seats. It is reported that the left-wing has already won, which was unexpected. Beforehand, the most optimistic people in that faction originally thought that even if they won, they would only win a few more seats. Now that they see the results like this, they are also surprised. According to the final results of each constituency announced this morning, the left-wing won a total of 13 seats in the city of Madrid, while the right-wing only won 4 seats. Among the left-wing, former Prime Minister and leader of the Republican Party, Azaña, received the most votes, totaling 218,641 votes. Even the person ranked thirteenth received as many as 214,049 votes. Among the four members of the right-wing, the leader of the Popular Action party and former Minister of War, Robles, was the champion, but he only received 189,048 votes. Among the fascist candidates, Rivera, the son of former dictator General Rivera, only received 4,268 votes. In the province of Madrid, the left-wing won six seats, while the right-wing only won two seats. According to news from the city of Oviedo, the left-wing also won in all parts of the province of Asturias. In the autonomous province of Catalonia, the left-wing won a total of 41 seats, while the right-wing only won 13 seats. Among the left-wing members elected from the provincial capital, Barcelona, the former President of the Autonomous Government, Companys, and the former Labor Department Advisor, Barrera, are also included. It is noted that the two were also elected in October of the previous year, which is enough to show the strength of the left-wing. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>

<p>London: The Subcommittee of Experts of the General Committee of the Naval Conference, responsible for drafting an agreement on the qualitative limitation of various warships (excluding battleships), held a meeting at Clarence House at 11:30 a.m. today, and is scheduled to continue the meeting this afternoon and tomorrow. Naval figures believe that the success or failure of the Naval Conference depends on the outcome of the French Ambassador to Britain, Corbin, and the Italian Naval Conference representatives, Lieutenant General Raineri and Rear Admiral Piccia, returning home for instructions. Regarding the issue of battleship tonnage, both France and Italy have raised objections to the 35,000 tons proposed by Britain and the United States. If this cannot be agreed upon, the previously agreed-upon issues of mutual notification of shipbuilding procedures and qualitative limitations of various auxiliary ships will all be in vain. Therefore, the representatives of the various countries will not hold important meetings before Corbin and Piccia return to London, and the two important issues of battleship tonnage and inviting Germany to participate in future agreements will also have to be discussed at a later date.

<h3 id="e50">First Major Battle Since the Battle of Magale: Italian Troops Win With New Weapons; Repel 80,000 Ethiopian Troops in Six Days of Fierce Fighting; Over a Thousand Killed and Wounded; Occupy 5,000-Foot-High Mountain; Approximately 5,000 Ethiopian Regular Army Soldiers Killed <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>◎Asmara: The first engagement between the Ethiopian regular army and the Italian army resulted in a major Italian victory. The Italian army has occupied Antalo, 15 miles south of Magale, and raised the Italian flag on Mount Amba Aradam. In this battle, 500 Italian soldiers were killed and 1,000 were wounded, while about 5,000 Ethiopian soldiers were killed. This was the first major battle since the Italian occupation of Magale, and the Italian victory is of great value. Mount Amba Aradam is 5,000 feet high and five miles wide, and is a natural barrier to the Sakota town on the highway to Taza. In this battle, various weapons of the new era, from hand grenades to airplanes, were used almost without exception, and it was the first battle in which all white soldiers participated. One division of Eritrean soldiers was only used as a reserve. The result was that the 25,000 regular troops led by Ethiopian General Mulugheta, who was holding Mount Amba Aradam, were driven away. The Ethiopian army also had 50,000 soldiers holding solid positions behind the defense to help. In this battle, the artillery played a great role. The horse artillery followed closely behind the Italian infantry, and the shells fired by the heavy artillery reached enemy positions ten miles away. However, tank artillery vehicles did not participate in the battle due to the inconvenient terrain. The battle was greatly hindered by continuous heavy rain. The Italian strategy was to have two independent columns bypass the eastern and western slopes of Amba Aradam and meet behind the mountain to encircle the mountain. It began on February 10. The First Army moved south to the Geba River, crossed the river safely without being seen by the enemy. The next day, the army captured the eastern edge of Amba Aradam, a mountain commonly known as Priest's Hat. On February 12, the First Division of the Third Army crossed the Battle River and reached a peak west of Amba Aradam at 8 a.m. The Ethiopian army put up fierce resistance. After that, intermittent shelling occurred, and the sound of artillery and aircraft rumbled, and the thatched huts were burned by the shells, with fires breaking out from time to time. Until 2:30 p.m., the heavy rain stopped the battle. At the same time, the left wing of the Blackshirts, who ascended the slope of Mount Amba Aradam, encountered strong resistance from the Ethiopian army. The Ethiopian army dispatched its entire reserve army to participate in the battle, repeatedly attacking Priest's Hat Mountain, aided by the artillery on Takoro, bombarding the Italian machine gun nests, but was eventually silenced by the Italian artillery's counter-bombardment. At noon, Italian Commander-in-Chief General Badoglio used Alpine Brigade troops to reinforce the battle. The battle lasted until 5 p.m., when the Italian army attacked its destination, the ridge of Mount Amba Aradam. On February 13, the Italian army began to repair the captured positions. The battle was greatly hampered by heavy rain, but 2,500 Ethiopian troops still attacked the Italian left wing in the rain, surrounding a large unit of the Sappada Division. The division relied on the help of the artillery to break through, killing 4,000 Ethiopian soldiers. Eighteen Italian soldiers were killed and sixty-four were wounded. On February 14, Italian aircraft braved the heavy rain to bombard the Ethiopian reinforcements that were moving from the rear to the front lines. On February 15, the Italian army advanced again on both flanks. The Ethiopian army resisted desperately. The Italian soldiers and machine guns on Mount Amba Aradam were all involved in the battle. The Italian artillery heavily bombarded the Ethiopian positions. At dusk, a team of Blackshirts, led by the Duke of Pistoia, raised the Italian flag on the summit of Mount Amba Aradam. The enemy troops retreated in the dark. Eventually, the Italian two-wing columns also met in Antalo, and saw enemy corpses lying everywhere, a testament to the ferocity of the Italian artillery bombardment. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>◎Magale: According to news from our reporter, the Emba Aradam area captured by the Italian army a few days ago is located in the triangular area between Magale, Emba Lachi, and Donchian, with the highest terrain controlling the pass of Bojella Agathe. It is the only way from the Tambien area to the city of Taza where the Ethiopian Emperor resides. A large force of Ethiopian troops was concentrated there, personally led by General Mulugheta, the Minister of the Army of the regiment, and fortifications were built to serve as a barrier to the northern route. Mulugheta was originally a servant of the Emperor and has risen to his current position. The troops he leads are all official Ethiopian troops, with the majority being guards in yellow uniforms, carrying submachine guns, and fully supplied and armed. The officers all carry maps. On the Italian side, a total of five divisions participated in the battle, all of which were domestic troops with sophisticated equipment and airfields built in the vicinity to serve as bases for the air force. However, because the Ethiopian army had more personnel and was familiar with the local terrain, the strength of both sides was roughly equal. Previously, on the 11th of this month, Italian Commander-in-Chief General Badoglio believed that the Ethiopian army had attacked in the Tambien area without success and that it was advisable to take the opportunity to counterattack, so he immediately ordered an offensive to be launched on the Entelda Plateau. After fierce resistance, 30,000 Ethiopian soldiers retreated, and the Italian army took advantage of the victory to advance to the Emba Aradam area and engage in a major battle with the Ethiopian army. Late on the 14th, Ethiopian General Mulugheta was unable to hold on and withdrew his troops, and the area was occupied by the Italian army. After hearing the news of the victory at the command post's observation deck, General Badoglio issued a statement to the military reporters from various countries, saying, "The Emba Aradam area was captured after you arrived here. You have brought good luck with you. I have been uneasy about Emba Aradam not yet being captured for a long time. Now that the Italian flag is flying over the area, I can finally rest assured." The General then praised the Ethiopian army for being brave and good at fighting, and said that during the battle, there was continuous heavy rain, and the roadbeds were loose, making it very inconvenient for the Italian army to supply. The expeditionary force's staff headquarters also issued a statement saying that the victory in this battle was of great importance because the Italian army could take advantage of the victory to advance south. When the Ethiopian army retreated, they set fire to several villages and towns where they had stored food, such as Enema Lian, Baruto, and Guwossa. In general, although the Ethiopian army has mostly retreated, the Emba Aradam Plateau is vast, and it is possible that several thousand remaining troops are hiding in it. The Italian staff headquarters is concerned that the remaining troops will rejoin the Ethiopian army and launch attacks, so it ordered the burning of several villages and towns to clear them out. According to our reporter, after the Emba Aradam battle, large-scale military operations on the northern route seem to have come to an end, because the newly built roads are cut off in two places, the roadbeds are loose, and it is inconvenient for transportation, so it is inevitable that the march will be temporarily suspended. In addition, the military reporters from various countries who participated in the funeral of the fallen Blackshirts in the Serico area saw that many native soldiers had been hit by expanding bullets, with mutilated limbs, which was a tragic sight.

<p>London: Italy protested to Britain on January 24, accusing Britain of adopting extraordinary and unfair plans without first consulting the League of Nations, saying that the secret understanding of a military nature arising from the British memorandum had created an atmosphere of panic that endangered European peace. It should be known that Italy's actions in East Africa are purely of a territorial and colonial nature and will never endanger European peace. Today, the British government has delivered a reply to the Italian Ambassador to Britain, Grandmachi, stating that Britain's position has been stated in the memorandum to the League of Nations Adjustment Committee and does not need to be repeated. It is noted that the British memorandum to the League of Nations detailed the results of the exchange of views between Britain and other governments regarding the situation in the Mediterranean, and in addition to declaring an agreement on mutual assistance between Britain and France in the event of an attack, it also stated that Britain had received assurances from Greece, Turkey, Spain, Yugoslavia, and other countries that they were prepared to faithfully fulfill various obligations under the League of Nations Covenant.

<p>London: It is rumored that the government's defense policy has been criticized by Austen Chamberlain, which may cause a political storm. The political circles do not pay much attention to it. Most of the members of the House of Commons who hold the same opinion as Chamberlain are now waiting for the publication of the government's white paper and then deciding their attitude. The cabinet will hold a special meeting today to consider the recommendations of the Defense Subcommittee. It is expected that several more meetings will be held this week. The government must now consider the adjustment of the Navy and Air Force in order to respond to Chamberlain's criticism of national defense. It is said that this adjustment work should be entrusted to a cabinet committee. If the cabinet decides that the national defense issue should be supervised by a cabinet member, then the issue of restoring Hall to the government will become a political discussion event.

<h3 id="e55">France's Loan from Britain: Totaling £60 Million <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Paris: Regarding the French Ministry of Finance's loan from Britain, the Echo de Paris reported that the loan will be provided by major banks in London. These banks have formed a syndicate, and once British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain returns to London this morning, it can be formally approved. If there are no unexpected complications, it should be completed by the middle of this week at the latest. "The total loan amount is £60 million in British gold, which is the largest international loan completed in the London market since the war. The annual interest rate is about 3%, and the term is nine months or one year, but the French Ministry of Finance may repay it in advance every three months if it wishes. According to absolutely reliable sources, this loan is only provided by the National Bank Syndicate for the use of the French Treasury, and is not the issuance of treasury bonds by France in the London market for circulation. This proves the strength and stability of the London capital market. As for the rumors that France will make concessions in economic and political aspects as exchange conditions for borrowing from Britain, and that British bankers have requested the Bank of France to provide guarantees, these are not true. We can see from the imminent completion of this loan that France's credit is well-known and trusted by the British financial community. As for France's borrowing of this huge amount, the domestic financial market will be reactivated in the next few weeks, and the currency and bond market conditions will also improve, which is what we can expect."

This afternoon, the Popular Front, jointly organized by the left-wing parties, held a large-scale demonstration to protest. All the left-wing elements of the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the Radical Socialist Party, the so-called "Red Eagle Corps" of the left-wing veterans' associations and youth labor unions, came to participate. The number of demonstrators reached as many as 100,000. At 2:30 p.m., they gathered in front of the Pantheon, led by Communist Party leader and Senator Cachin, Socialist Party leader and former Minister of the Interior Frot, Radical Socialist Party leader and former Prime Minister Daladier, and marched through the streets of Paris for five hours.

People watched along the way, including Radical Socialist Party fighters, the masses, and curious citizens. Several anti-fascist intellectuals and famous university professors, such as Ribaud's Valla Berri and the Director of the Court of Audit, were also in the parade. The procession went very well, except that in the Latin Quarter, several students belonging to the right-wing shouted and protested as the procession passed, resulting in a conflict with the demonstrators.

The full text of the resolution is translated below: "Whereas the Japanese government is clearly violating the League of Nations Covenant and the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, occupying Manchuria, Inner Mongolia, and North China, leading to a significant increase in the risk of war in the Far East and the world; and whereas the Chinese people's patriotic organizations are jointly struggling to resist aggression; and whereas the fundamental interests of the United States and the maintenance of peace in the Far East are at stake; therefore, we, the representatives attending the Third National Anti-War Association, gathered in Cleveland, Ohio, from January 3rd to 5th, 1936, hereby pass the following resolution:</p>
<p>Protest against Japan's forceful occupation of Manchuria and North China, and its aggressive policies towards eastern Siberia;</p>
<p>Demand the withdrawal of all US troops stationed in China." (Central News Agency, 17th)</p>

<p>Decide to Reject Participation of Third Country in Investigation Team</p>
<p>Tokyo: Major General Imai, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Army Ministry, and Okamura, Chief of the Second Department of the General Staff Headquarters, visited Togo, Director of the European and Asian Affairs Bureau of the Foreign Ministry, at 10:00 AM on the 17th. They exchanged views on the content of the meeting between Ambassador Ota to Russia and the Soviet Foreign Minister on the 14th regarding the establishment of a mixed commission, and the Gold Mine Gulch Incident. They left at noon. On the same day, the Army-Foreign Ministry Consultative Meeting decided to reject the participation of neutral commissioners from third countries in the mixed commission proposed by Russia. The Northern Suifen Incident, which occurred on October 6th last year, requested the participation of a third country for resolution, but it has been proven that such nominal participation of a third country does more harm than good. Foreign Minister Hirota will base his final decision on this resolution and instruct the ambassador to Russia to formally reject the proposal to the Russian government. Furthermore, Major General Imai explained the facts of the Outer Mongolian border crossing incident and the active military actions of the Soviet Union, and after discussing countermeasures, he mentioned the issue of a Japanese-Soviet non-aggression treaty. It was decided that if the Soviet Union continues such actions, Japan will refuse to conclude such a treaty. After the meeting, Director Togo invited Lieutenant Colonel Tanaka from the Kwantung Army General Staff to listen to his views on the Soviet Union issue. (Domei News Agency, 17th)</p>

<p>If Kwantung Army Acts Arbitrarily, Its Future is Very Dangerous</p>
<p>London: The current situation between "Manchukuo" and Outer Mongolia has recently been commented on by The Times, which stated that the tension in relations between Japan and the Soviet Union can be seen in this situation. Fortunately, after frequent incidents on the border between "Manchukuo" and Outer Mongolia, there has been some awareness within Japan. According to recent news from Tokyo, someone suggested that the Japanese government must restrain the policies pursued by the Kwantung Army. The Soviet Union's military strength in the Far East has been greatly strengthened, and its transportation facilities have also been improved. If the Kwantung Army continues to cause trouble arbitrarily, the danger is very great. The newspaper also concluded that, according to a dispatch from this newspaper's correspondent in Tokyo, Japanese newspapers have made suggestions regarding the "Manchukuo" border conflict incidents, stating that third-country observers should be invited to the scene of the incidents to conduct investigations, and that Japan and Russia should conduct negotiations in the hope of concluding a short-term mutual non-aggression pact. However, it is uncertain whether the Kwantung Army's unilateral actions can be stopped. Even if the Japanese government takes such measures, it is impossible to hope that the Soviet Union will make concessions, as it did when Japan bought the Chinese Eastern Railway in 1932. The Soviet Union of today and the Soviet Union of that time cannot be confused. (Havas, 17th)</p>

<h3 id="e81">The Problem of Risk <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Ren</p>
<p>Risk is the chance of loss or harm. If loss or harm can be predicted to certainly occur, we can take precautions beforehand, estimate the value of the loss or harm, or resign ourselves to fate and let it take its course. If loss or harm is not certain to occur, but there is a possibility of it occurring, and the extent of the loss or harm after it occurs cannot be predicted, then the occurrence and the consequences after the occurrence are all subject to chance. The characteristic of chance is uncertainty, so the origin of risk is also due to uncertainty. It is inevitable that people will grow old and die, but at what age they will die, and how they will die, are all unknowable. For people over ninety-five years old, their lives are truly like morning dew, and they can die at any time. For people in their thirties and forties, who can predict that they will certainly die, and who can predict that they will certainly die prematurely? However, there are indeed people in their thirties and forties who do not die, and there are indeed people in their thirties and forties who die prematurely. Therefore, people in their thirties and forties, although they do not need to worry about their death day and night, cannot be certain that they will not die. The same is true for people of other ages. This is what is called risk. The essence of risk here is survival or death, and the origin of risk here is due to the uncertainty of survival or death. The boiler in a factory will inevitably become old and dilapidated and unable to work after being used for a long time. Therefore, the manager of the factory must estimate the extent of the loss based on the number of years the boiler has been used, and treat it as part of the factory's manufacturing cost. However, some boilers can continue to be used until they are old and dilapidated and unable to work, while others can suddenly explode and be destroyed before the end of their usable life. No one dares to predict which factory's boiler will inevitably explode halfway, but it is possible for every boiler to explode or not to explode. Therefore, all factories equipped with boilers have the risk of boiler explosion, and the origin of risk here is due to the uncertainty of exploding or not exploding. Furthermore, in the operation of a business, the key lies in buying goods at low prices and selling them at high prices to make a profit. However, except for a few who enjoy patent rights or have successfully implemented monopoly policies, the prices of goods going in and out are affected by market supply and demand at any time and place, and fluctuate constantly. If the purchase price is low and the selling price is high, the chance of making a profit is great. If the purchase price is high and the selling price is low, a loss is inevitable. Moreover, the chance of making a profit depends not only on the keen and accurate observation of market changes by the business operator to determine the price and quantity of sales, but also on whether the arrangement of personnel and the raising of funds are appropriate, which can also affect whether or not a profit is made. Proper management can maintain existing capital and even earn a profit, while improper management can lead to losses exceeding capital. Therefore, once a business operator decides on a certain industry, they immediately risk capital loss, and the origin of risk here is due to the uncertainty of using capital to seek profit. As for purchasing real estate and worrying about fire, shipping goods and worrying about sinking, investing in industry and worrying about company bankruptcy, and buying bonds and worrying about the lack of principal and interest, entrepreneurs have the worry of losing capital, and the labor sector feels the suffering of unemployment and idleness. The reason for this is all due to uncertainty. Therefore, the problem of risk is always present in the organization and operation of our social economy.</p>
<p>Risk can be divided into two types: static and dynamic. An individual lives and works in peace and dies or does not die at a certain age, and a house remains or is burned or not burned, are static risks. Racing horses and dying prematurely or not dying, running a business and coping with a volatile market, or losing capital or maintaining capital and having a surplus, are dynamic risks. Risk can also be divided into two types: speculative and pure. Speculative risk has the chance of loss, but also the hope of profit. For example, buying and selling securities and operating industry, commerce, agriculture, and mining. If one is unfortunate and loses, of course there is no way to recover, but if one is fortunate and succeeds, the profit will certainly far exceed expectations. Pure risk, such as houses and machines, if they are burned, the loss can absolutely not be recovered. Even if they are fortunately preserved, they will definitely not increase the hope of profit in addition to the original use efficiency. According to its nature, risk can be divided into five types. The first is natural risk, such as droughts, floods, winds, hailstorms, frosts, snow, and fires. It has a huge impact on harvests, animal husbandry, and transportation, and the arrival of disasters and their consequences are difficult to predict. The second is production risk. Modern production requires machinery and labor. Machines, such as boilers, have the risk of explosion, the cause of which is due to the unsoundness of the materials and the negligence of the managers. The impact of this is to stop production. As for labor, it is difficult to standardize and consistently maintain the efficiency of work, so production cannot be predicted as expected. Moreover, the above-mentioned natural risks are sufficient to cause drastic changes in the source and price of raw materials, causing the result of production, whether in quantity or value, to be reduced at any time. Furthermore, agricultural production relies heavily on the forces of nature, so speculation is most evident. The third is social risk, such as wars, riots, strikes, factory shutdowns, robberies, and counterfeiting. The fourth is the risk of personal ignorance. This risk is due to the individual's failure to take advantage of existing opportunities and knowledge, allowing the keen to compete for and obtain unexpected benefits, while the foolish and weak fall behind and suffer the losses of competition. This is a common phenomenon in commerce, where the pioneers of new businesses advance bravely to make profits, while the followers struggle to keep up. The fifth is market risk. Because there is a time sequence, the supply and demand prices on the market are constantly changing, and merchants have to bear the risk of market price fluctuations caused by time.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are degrees of risk. If a loss is certain to occur, and even the time of occurrence can be predicted, then no matter how great the loss is, it cannot be called risk. As mentioned earlier, this type of loss can either be left to nature, or precautions can be taken beforehand, or it can be transformed into cost. The greatest risk lies in the point of greatest uncertainty, which is when the probability of success and failure is equal to each other, as in probability logic or mathematics. The further the chance of failure is from the chance of success, the higher the probability of failure, and the smaller its uncertainty or risk. Those who run businesses are actually weighing the gains and losses of their transactions day and night. If a profit can be guaranteed, they will naturally go for it. If a loss is certain, they will either try their best to avoid it, or transform it into cost and incorporate it into the selling price. What they are most uneasy about and cannot resolve is when the gains and losses are close to each other. This is because it is the most uncertain. The common saying "It may make money, it may not make money" expresses this kind of psychology and risk.</p>
<p>The degree of risk varies, and the estimation of risk also varies depending on the person and their circumstances. The middle class, in addition to being able to guarantee food and clothing, has limited financial resources, so even a small loss involves a great sacrifice, and their estimation of various risks must be high. The wealthy have millions of assets, so even a loss of several thousand is not a problem, and their estimation of the same risk must be low. For example, in today's securities market speculation, although both the poor and the rich participate, those with weak financial resources, except for a very few who are willing to make a desperate gamble, are generally satisfied with a small gain. Those with strong financial resources must endure losses to wait for a good price. Since their stakes are large, their expectations must be high, and their losses or profits must be huge. However, this does not mean that those with strong financial resources will not fail. In fact, there are many cases where those with abundant resources have lost repeatedly until they have lost their entire fortunes. However, after all, those with abundant financial resources have a lower estimation of the risk of loss, so they dare to continue speculating. If they lose, they will lose a lot. If they win, they will win a lot. There is also a certain kind of risk for which there is an accurate numerical value that can be verified. For example, tossing a coin and betting that it will land on heads can win ten yuan, but the probability of the coin landing on heads is one-half, and the probability of it landing on tails is also one-half. Multiplying ten yuan by one-half yields five yuan, which is the estimated value of this risk. The operation of life insurance is based on this principle.</p>
<p>Since risk is a universal phenomenon, how should we deal with it? There are three ways: first, to eliminate risk; second, to directly bear the risk oneself; and third, to transfer the risk to others. The first type is like us preparing umbrellas to prevent rain and snow, and building high walls to isolate neighboring fires. In commerce, it is about having detailed and timely statistics on the market, analyzing its supply and demand conditions at any time, and implementing scientific management internally to improve efficiency and eliminate waste. As for human life and death, although it cannot be predicted, it can be shared among many people by life insurance companies, sharing the losses of death. To prevent deposit runs, banks must set aside a sufficient reserve. Importers and exporters simultaneously purchase foreign exchange in the near term and sell it in the far term to avoid exchange rate risk. The second type is like entrepreneurs paying workers a stipulated wage, creditors paying a stipulated interest, and then bearing all other profits and losses themselves. Scholars and playboys mistakenly believe that running a business is like a blind man riding a blind horse, extremely dangerous, but merchants treat it as normal with habit and experience. Although there is a risk of loss, most of them consider it natural and move forward bravely. There are also many capitalists and speculators who directly invest in industry or buy and sell securities themselves. There are a few instances where workers do not ask about the amount of wages, but work directly, seeking income through work opportunities, but the waiters in maritime hotels and restaurants are quite similar to this. The third type is that households with a little savings often entrust banks to invest on their behalf, or deposit money in banks and money shops to earn interest, because they believe that these organizations are better able to bear risk based on their specialized knowledge and experience. Rather than investing directly and having uncertain profits and losses, why not transfer this risk to experts? It is true that banks and money shops are not absolutely safe, but under normal circumstances, their ability to identify investments is stronger than that of private individuals, which cannot be denied. In short, the more complex the social organization and the more developed the credit economy, the more types of risk there are, and the more advanced the methods of preventing risk are due to government supervision and the research of private organizations.</p>

<p>— Jin Dui</p>
<p>(D) Uses and Sales of Livestock: The primary food source for the local Hui and Tibetan people in Gansu Province has traditionally been dairy products. Therefore, mutton in Gansu can almost be considered a staple food. The remaining wool and hides are exported to other provinces as raw materials for weaving. The quantity is also significant. Since the opening of maritime trade after the late Qing Dynasty, they have often been exported to overseas markets. Foreign firms in Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, and other places often stationed people in Lintan, Minxian, Xiahe, Jingyuan, Haiyuan, and other counties to purchase locally. Due to the obstructed transportation in the Northwest, the strength of livestock is heavily relied upon for transportation. Consequently, cattle, horses, donkeys, mules, and camels have all become essential means of transportation. Among cattle, the large flat cattle produced in Minxian are valued for their strength and docility, making them ideal for driving carts and plowing fields. The small hairy cattle, also known as zebu cattle, produced in Xiahe, Liancheng, and other places are mostly used for labor and are transported to various parts of the provincial capital for their milk and meat for human consumption. The horses from Yongdeng, Lintan, and Minxian are sold annually to Henan, Shaanxi, and other provinces as military horses, in considerable numbers.</p>
<p>7. The Wool Industry in Gansu</p>
<p>Gansu borders Shaanxi, Suiyuan, Ningxia, Qinghai, and other provinces. Its climate is roughly the same as that of the northwestern provinces. Due to the favorable local conditions, animal husbandry is most suitable, as mentioned in the previous article. Consequently, a majority of the people make a living by nomadism, with sheep herding being the most prevalent, unlike the southeastern provinces where sheep raising is considered a sideline. The wool produced annually, apart from supplying the province for the manufacture of woolen blankets, coarse wool fabrics, rugs, and various knitted woolen goods, is exported every year. According to the Gansu Republic Daily, a survey conducted in 1932 (Year 21 of the Republic) found that spring wool production was 15,406 dan (each dan weighing 100 jin), priced at 20 yuan per dan, totaling 308,120 yuan. Autumn wool production was 15,406 dan, priced at 25 yuan per dan, totaling 385,150 yuan. A survey in 1933 (Year 22 of the Republic) found that spring wool production was 21,362 dan, priced at 20 yuan per dan, totaling 427,240 yuan. Autumn wool production was 21,362 dan, priced at 25 yuan per dan, totaling 534,050 yuan. According to statistics from the Department of Construction, a survey in 1934 (Year 23 of the Republic), based solely on detailed reports from 28 counties, showed a total annual production of 1,329,438 kilograms, with an annual value of 618,949 yuan. If a comprehensive calculation were to be made for all counties throughout the year, the figure would undoubtedly be even higher. The abundant wool production is evident.</p>
<p>Wool is generally divided into two types: cotton sheep wool (white sheep wool) and goat wool (black sheep wool). In addition to these two types, Gansu also produces what is called  wool, which comes from a goat with long white hair. It can be used to make leather clothing and felt blankets and woolen fabrics but is not suitable for making woolen cloth because it has too little fine down and is too stiff. Another type is called purple sheep wool, which comes from a cotton sheep with long black hair. It is mostly produced in Tibet, hence its other name, Tibetan sheep. It is best for making leather clothing because it has more fine down and strong heat-retention properties, making it suitable for keeping warm even in the severe winter. Moreover, black wool from cotton sheep is quite rare, making it very popular.</p>
<p>For wool used in textile raw materials, the preference is for fibers that are fine, long, and have considerable elasticity and luster. They can be woven into various woolen fabrics and dyed in any color. Moreover, the natural yield of this type is relatively abundant among all types of wool. Wool that possesses these characteristics is cotton sheep wool. Conversely, fibers that are uneven in thickness, dull in color, and cannot be dyed to satisfaction, with cotton sheep yielding only one jin of wool per shearing compared to the half jin yielded by goats, are the disadvantages of goat wool.</p>
<p>Shearing wool is largely done in two seasons: spring and autumn. The spring shearing period is around the Qingming Festival. The wool has endured severe cold weather in the winter and contains the most down and the finest fibers. Wool sheared at this time is called spring wool. The autumn shearing period is around the Mid-Autumn Festival. The wool has been exposed to hot weather in the summer and contains a high oil content and stronger elasticity. Wool sheared at this time is called autumn wool. In addition, there is plucked wool and sheep down, mostly plucked in the summer. As for pelt wool, it is the waste wool scraped off during the manufacture of leather clothing and leather, also called dead wool, containing a high amount of lime and cannot be dyed.</p>
<p>During the spring and autumn seasons, when wool comes to market, wool merchants purchase it in the pastoral areas and transport it to the cities, reselling it to woolen manufacturers. Due to the remote location and inconvenient transportation, direct purchasing from inland areas to Gansu has been rare in recent years. In the areas inhabited by the Tibetans and other ethnic minorities, wool is still exchanged for daily necessities. This seems to be a remnant of the "barter" system from thousands of years ago, which they still retain. As for ordinary wool trade, there are no standard weights and measures. Some scales use sixteen or twenty-four taels as one jin, while others use thirty-two taels as one jin. These variations are likely due to the vast distances, complex ethnicities, and different customs. In recent years, the domestic and international economic downturn has affected the wool sales, which have plummeted. Gansu has traditionally relied on wool as a major export commodity. If improvements can be made and the wool industry revitalized, it would benefit China, promote domestic goods, recover foreign earnings, and contribute to the development of the Northwest.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Massive Fire in Nanshi, Tianjin <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Warming Shelter Burns Down, 150 Killed: Charred Bones and Corpses Litter the Ground, a Horrific Sight</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: The warming shelter run by the Mingde Charity Association and the porridge kitchen run by the Chinese Merchants Association behind the Grand Theater in Qinghe Street, Tianjin's Nanshi District, caught fire unexpectedly at 2:50 AM yesterday (the 14th) and were completely destroyed. A total of 149 men and women perished in the inferno, making it an unprecedented tragedy. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Facilities of the Warming Shelter</p>
<p>The Mingde Charity Association in the Japanese Concession of this city is organized by a group of gentry and merchants. Last year, to shelter the homeless from the severe cold, they established a warming shelter in October on the vacant land behind the Grand Theater in Nanshi, a place where the lower strata of Tianjin society gather. It was quite popular. In December, they expanded part of it, accommodating up to 300 or 400 homeless people. At the time of the fire, there were about 200 people staying there. Adjacent to the north of the warming shelter was the porridge kitchen established by the Chinese Merchants Association. The two groups cooperated, with the Chinese Merchants Association providing porridge at noon and the warming shelter providing food in the evening. In total, more than 1,000 people ate there daily. The two places occupied a vast area of 20 mu. The warming shelter was constructed with bamboo poles and reed mats, a total of four layers, to prevent wind penetration. The ground was covered with straw and multiple layers of waste newspaper. In addition to the boiler, there were also several large coal stoves inside. The homeless considered it a blessed place and flocked to the shelter. Men and women were separated into two sections. Even during the severe cold, it was very comfortable. Even rickshaw pullers and peddlers abandoned their homes to stay there.</p>
<p>Sudden Fire</p>
<p>The warming shelter had two managers and five watchmen who patrolled at night. However, with so many people accommodated, there was a mix of good and bad. The front and back doors were locked at night. The Sixth Precinct of the First Public Security Bureau, which was in charge of the area, also sent officers to inspect from time to time. Unexpectedly, at 2:50 AM yesterday, when all was quiet, a fire suddenly broke out. The internal structure of the warming shelter was highly flammable. In an instant, flames soared, illuminating several miles around. The nearby patrol police discovered it and immediately reported it to the Public Security Bureau. All eight fire brigades in the city were dispatched. However, because the fire had already engulfed the entire shelter, the water hoses could do little. So they focused on rescuing people. At that time, screams filled the air, a most tragic scene. It was not until 5:30 AM that the fire was completely extinguished.</p>
<p>Number of Deaths</p>
<p>Apart from those who escaped, the number of deaths, after investigation, was 149, including 141 men (including one watchman), 6 women, and 3 children (2 boys and 1 girl). The corpses were exposed on the spot. The Tianjin District Court sent prosecutors to examine them at 3:00 PM. In the evening, the Public Welfare Society prepared coffins and buried all the bodies. The Director of the Public Security Bureau, Liu Yushu, visited the scene at 10:00 AM. In the evening, he invited monks to pray for the dead. When reporters visited the scene, many spectators were present. The corpses were piled up to one side, completely charred. Some had their internal organs exposed. The scene was so tragic that it was unbearable to witness.</p>
<p>Relief Measures</p>
<p>The cause of the fire has not yet been determined. The Sixth Precinct of the First District has taken the four watchmen, Wang Jialin, Li Wengui (from the Mingde Charity Association warming shelter), Pang Zixi, and Cao Zhenlin (from the Chinese Merchants Association porridge kitchen), to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. Their statements did not reveal the cause of the fire. The City Public Security Bureau has ordered the staff of the Mingde Charity Association to report the truth and has also sent people to investigate everything in order to handle the aftermath and relief work. The Mingde Charity Association held an emergency meeting at 3:00 PM on the 15th to discuss the handling of the aftermath. They resolved to ask the Public Welfare Society for materials and to provide compensation to the families of the deceased. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM. The compensation plan has also been drafted and will be implemented immediately.</p>
<p>Attitude of the Authorities</p>
<p>After receiving the report, the Tianjin Municipal Government sent Inspector Tian Jiuying to conduct an on-site investigation and handle the matter. It is reported that the Chairman of the Mingde Charity Association, Zhong Shiming, considered himself responsible for the matter and avoided meeting with anyone yesterday. Currently, Zhao Pinqing, Chairman of the Charity Federation, Xiao Shaotang, Director of the Public Welfare Society, and Liu Daopeng, Chairman of the Red Cross Society, are separately responsible for handling the aftermath. The unclaimed bodies have been temporarily buried in the public cemetery in Wangjiazhuang in the western suburbs.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Hebei-Chahar Negotiations: Still Many Thorns Ahead <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Yin Rugeng Demands that Eastern Hebei Be Changed to a Special Administrative Region; The Administration of the Six Counties in Northern Chahar Has Not Yet Been Restored to Its Original State</p>
<p>Beiping Dispatch: The Hebei-Chahar diplomatic issue has made little progress due to the excessive demands. The issue of abolishing the organization in Eastern Hebei is not even being discussed at this moment. Yin Rugeng has two demands: (1) that Eastern Hebei be changed to a special administrative region with Yin as the chief administrator; and (2) that the five provinces of North China be autonomous. The Beiping authorities have not approved these demands. Therefore, diplomatic negotiations are not easy to conduct at this time. Song Zheyuan, Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, received Xiao Zhenying, Qin Dechun, and Feng Zhi'an at his private residence this morning (the 16th) and inquired about important matters. According to Tianjin Mayor Xiao Zhenying, the Hebei-Chahar diplomacy is currently under separate negotiation. The Economic Committee held a meeting yesterday to discuss the financial reorganization of the two provinces of Hebei and Chahar and the two cities of Beiping and Tianjin. Whether Wang Tianyou's case will be settled in Beiping is still uncertain. I am scheduled to return to Tianjin tomorrow to handle political affairs.</p>
<p>After Luo Jiaheng, the Chahar Diplomatic Commissioner, arrived in Beiping, he discussed the Chahar issue with Chen Zhongfu, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Tonight, Luo will return to Shanghai via Beijing and will first report the recent situation of Chahar's diplomacy to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs before going to Shanghai. He is expected to return to the north in two weeks. According to Luo, I arrived in Tianjin at the end of last month and went to Zhangjiakou on the 6th of this month. At that time, rumors were rampant, but the facts are not so. The authorities are very firm in their intention not to give up land lightly. Li Shouxin and Zhuo Shihai's troops, totaling more than 2,000, are divided into independent teams and security teams and have no intention of moving south. The year number on their proclamations is the number of years since Genghis Khan. The administration of the six counties in northern Chahar has not been restored to its original state because negotiations have not yet been completed.</p>
<p>Doihara, the representative of the Japanese Kwantung Army, recently made a statement, saying that everything has progressed since the establishment of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee. The Eastern Hebei region has some misunderstandings with the committee. Once the misunderstandings are cleared up, the two sides can be expected to unite. Regarding the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee hiring consultants, if the committee wishes to hire Japanese technicians, I am very willing to introduce them. My current task in staying in Beiping is to strive for peace between China and Japan. All issues are being discussed in turn. Li Shouxin in northern Chahar has a close relationship with the Mongolian side, but not with Manchukuo. It is said that they have no intention of advancing towards the Sui border. As for De Wang, he travels back and forth constantly due to the geographical relationship between Mongolia and Manchuria, but he has not discussed any other issues except seeking local stability.</p>
<p>The internal organization of the Hebei-Chahar Diplomatic Committee is divided into two groups: General Affairs and Political Affairs. Each group is divided into three sections, with four secretaries and three to five specialists. The heads of each section have already been announced. The head of the first section of the General Affairs Group is Lin Gengyu, the head of the second section is Xu Wenyuan (acting as a first-class staff member), and the head of the third section is Ou Daqing. Hu Zheng and Ou Xiaoqing have been announced as secretaries. Four specialists have been internally appointed and will be announced in the next few days. The committee has appointed three additional members: Tang Yueliang, Ren Yuandao, and Zhang Yuquan. Tang has arrived in Beiping, while Zhang and Ren are still staying in Shanghai (16th).</p>
<h3 id="e85">Tianjin Exempts Burdensome Taxes <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Merchants and Citizens Gain Opportunity for Resuscitation; City Government Compensates for Municipal Taxes by Sealing Off the Huili Ball Field</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: Since Xiao Zhenying became the mayor of Tianjin, he has shown a strong intention to let the people rest and recuperate. Shortly after taking office, he first exempted eight types of burdensome taxes in Tianjin. As a member of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, he suggested to Song Zheyuan that three types of water transport taxes on ships in the five rivers of Hebei Province be exempted. For a time, merchants and citizens celebrated. Recently, four other types of taxes, including stall taxes, reed mat taxes, and entertainment taxes, are being reviewed and will soon be abolished. In recent years, Tianjin's commerce has been troubled by both internal and external factors. Internally, the market is sluggish, the rural economy is bankrupt, and the purchasing power of urban and rural areas is weak, causing all industries to stagnate. Externally, Japanese and Korean ruffians smuggle goods with evaded tariffs, which are then sold by unscrupulous merchants, affecting legitimate businessmen. Furthermore, the heavy and complicated taxes have put merchants in a state of moaning and struggling to survive. The city government's decision to exempt and reduce taxes has given hope to the general business community. Since the Spring Festival, various industries in the city have been slightly active. Although it has not yet reached a great situation, if the market remains calm as it is now, a turning point can be expected in the second half of the year. Xiao Zhenying is determined to revive the Chinese area and has instructed Ji Hua, chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, to draft a plan. If it is permitted by the regulations, he will resolve to implement it to relieve the general suffering. Therefore, Ji Hua is currently reviewing and drafting a plan. The City Chamber of Commerce, the Money Industry Association, and other organizations are planning to hold a "Huanghui" fair in mid-March of the lunar calendar to revitalize the market. The so-called "Huanghui" is a type of northern fair that brings together people from the city and countryside to a market for several days of processions. During these days, all kinds of arts and crafts are displayed, and the gold industry also celebrates with lanterns. The government waives all import and export and local taxes during this period. Fifteen years ago, Tianjin used to hold it in early spring. On the day of the fair, the streets were deserted, and many villagers came to the city to visit. According to the Chamber of Commerce, this is not to promote superstition but to use this event to create a buzz and attract people from all directions. All industries can display their goods during the fair for people to see and learn about the product. This is like the wheat festival celebrations in the West or an exhibition. Tianjin merchants have been like fish trapped in a dry rut for a long time. If they can get tax exemptions during the fair, they can take the opportunity to import some goods. The government loses very little, but the merchants benefit greatly. The city government has already agreed to this. However, Tianjin's tax revenue last year was already strained due to the rapid changes in the political situation, frequent personnel changes, and the fatigue of commerce and industry. The city's budget requires more than 5 million yuan per year, and with the various contributions, it requires more than 7 million yuan per year. If the previous year's example is followed this year, tax revenue will be at most 5 or 6 million yuan. Exempting various miscellaneous taxes totals more than 300,000 yuan. Although the amount is not huge, at this time, losing one cent is like missing ten thousand. Therefore, the city government is trying its best to find ways to compensate. However, compensating cannot mean adding burdens to the citizens. Therefore, they thought of the Italian-owned Huili Ball Field, ordering it to pay 100,000 yuan in charity donations annually. According to the authorities, although the Huili Ball Field is located in the Italian concession, 90% of the gamblers are Chinese. Since its establishment, countless men and women who gamble have lost their fortunes and even committed suicide by drowning or poisoning. Since the victims are all Chinese, the Chinese government has no way to ban it, so it can only order it to pay a sum of charity money to be used for the city's construction, to atone for its sins and prevent citizens from resenting it too much. Last month, Xiao Zhenying ordered Liu Dongxuan, director of the Social Affairs Bureau, to negotiate. The Italian directors of the Huili Ball Field took a tough stance and refused to accept the intention. The city government then issued a warning, saying that if they did not comply, they would order the Second and Third Special Districts to seal off the Italian Concession. Because the Italian Concession is located in Hebei and is between the Second and Third Special Districts, gamblers must pass through the two districts every night. Italy initially did not budge but then agreed to pay 20,000 yuan annually, which the city government did not accept. The two sides reached a stalemate. Since the 13th of this month, the Public Security Bureaus of the Second and Third Special Districts have secretly ordered all public transportation companies and rental cars not to pick up or drop off gamblers at the Huili Ball Field. Those who are found will be severely punished. Private individuals who go to gamble are secretly investigated and warned. Even rickshaws are restricted. Therefore, in recent days, the Huili Ball Field has been unusually deserted, and even the dance floor is dimly lit and sparsely populated. However, the Italian concession authorities still maintain their tough stance and refuse to yield, so the stalemate continues (15th).</p>
<h3 id="e86">Britain Hastens Construction of Singapore Naval Base <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Chaoshan Workers Flock South to Work</p>
<p>Shantou Dispatch: After the London Disarmament Conference, Britain decided to allocate an additional 300 million pounds to strengthen its national defense and protect British interests in the world and the Far East, open an air route from Menam (transliteration) to Hong Kong, send airships to visit Japan, and build up Hong Kong's naval and air bases. Because Britain's seven-year military buildup plan is now nearing completion, all projects are being rushed, costing a total of 30,000,000 pounds. Singapore has become the world's largest naval base and the only fortress to protect interests in the Far East. Seven years ago, a large floating dock, 855 feet long and 178 feet wide, was completed in that year. It can accommodate giant ships of 50,000 tons, dragging them out of the water. The floating dock can accommodate 60,000 people standing on it. When it was towed from Wallsend to Singapore, it required eight tugboats and took three months. The floating dock is called No. 9. Britain has a larger floating dock, No. 8, located in Malta, a naval base in the Mediterranean. Malta's strategic location is important, serving as a backup naval port for the Strait of Gibraltar. Singapore's seven-year plan is undoubtedly related to this location. The No. 9 dock is located in Seletar, Singapore, covering an area of 2,800 acres, more than four square miles, and is the most modern and complete naval and air base. In addition, there is a 600-acre naval and air aviation landing field. The land was originally a desolate, uninhabited forest but has now been transformed into steel-roofed aircraft hangars, repair shops, barracks, and other complete facilities. At the southern end of the airfield is the largest radio station, which can be used for military communications between London, Hong Kong, and Shanghai. The village of Changzhao, Singapore, has been transformed into barracks for infantry, artillery, and engineers. Solid fortifications have been built on the mountains near the engineers' barracks, with anti-aircraft guns and long-range artillery. Chinese workers have contributed greatly to the construction of this massive project. Singapore has become the world's seventh-largest port and a major transportation route between the East and West Oceans and a prosperous commercial route. It now has a population of 440,000, with whites (excluding soldiers) accounting for 7,600. It is Britain's most productive colony. During the British Imperial Conference in 1912, New Zealand Prime Minister Massey said that if a hypothetical war were to occur with a certain powerful Eastern nation, without the solid naval and air base in Singapore, Australia and New Zealand would be unable to send troops to assist. At the British Imperial Conference in 1922, Britain abolished the Anglo-Japanese Alliance in the Pacific and insisted on establishing a naval base in Singapore, so that the British Far East Fleet would have a place to repair and refuel. In 1924, British important figure Hankey visited Singapore and, after returning home, submitted a memorandum on the importance of establishing a military port in Singapore. Thus, the seven-year plan was established. All countries with interests in the Far East (USA, France, Netherlands) are protected by the Singapore military port, except for Japan, which opposes it.</p>

<p>Last year, the county detained a large number of tenant farmers who owed rent. Their lives were extremely difficult. The other night, three detained tenant farmers, including Chen, got up to urinate. They searched everywhere for a urinal but could not find one, so they urinated in a corner. A police officer saw this and immediately lashed out with a whip, adding punches and kicks. All three were injured. Tenant farmer Wang Qingtang was the most seriously injured. The next day, he was carried to the Minshang Clinic for examination and treatment. It was found that his lower abdomen was kicked and his life was in danger. The three were later transferred to the county hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>Yu Xirong, a resident of Xialang Village, Tangtou Town, Fifth District of the county, has been working as a silk pawnshop clerk at the Yongtai Jiang Transportation Company. His father, A San, is sixty-three years old. Both father and son are strong and powerful. The other night, eight robbers broke into their house to rob them. Yu Xirong and his father were awakened from their dreams. Hastily, they rang the gong to call for help and used door bolts to knock down one robber. Another robber was also pinned down by Yu Xirong and could not move. However, the robbers were too many. Yu Xirong was stabbed in the back by a robber with a broadsword, injuring his lungs. A San was also stabbed. Seeing that they had caused trouble, the robbers snatched two leather suitcases and many clothes, totaling more than three hundred yuan, and fled in a panic. The incident has been reported to the county government through the Public Security Bureau. The injured person was also brought to the city for treatment. It is said that his condition is extremely serious, but his life is not yet in danger.</p>

<p>Last year, the county's silk industry rebounded, and all silk factories in Xidi made double profits. Therefore, the interest of farmers raising silkworms is also very strong. During the winter last year, they had already placed orders for spring silkworm eggs at the model silkworm farming area's guidance centers. After a thorough investigation by the model area, the county needs 300,000 sheets of spring silkworm eggs this year, which have already been prepared. Currently, 150,000 sheets have already been ordered. However, because the number of silk farmers has increased, the guidance center has decided to expand to 95 locations, an increase of 15 locations compared to last year. Funding has been approved by the Department of Construction. In addition, to facilitate farmers' own drying of cocoons, cocoon stoves of four multipliers and below will be checked and registered.</p>

<p>The Zhejiang Province coastal seawall stretches for hundreds of miles. Due to years of disrepair, the seawall body is riddled with holes, and the situation is critical. However, the provincial treasury is depleted, and there are no funds available for repairs. As the spring floods are approaching, if proper protection is not provided, a single accident would have significant consequences. Zhou Zhenlun, Director of the Water Conservancy Bureau, took a car yesterday to inspect the Haining section of the seawall along the coast and returned to the province in the evening. According to him, the most dangerous sections of the seawall are those between Haining and the eighth (number missing) section, with the Gongmao and other marked areas being the worst. The seawall body is leaning forward and sloping downwards, making the situation extremely dangerous. Additionally, the Wuduo and other marked areas have been using earthen dikes for defense since the seawall body collapsed last year, which could lead to danger if impacted by tides. There are many other dangerous seawall projects. He has instructed the engineering office of the section to prepare a detailed plan to be submitted to the province to request funds for repairs, in order to avoid accidents.</p>

<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange last night that the total transaction amount for yesterday afternoon's 4:30 session was over 3.8 million yuan. Since the market was suspended on January 30th by order of the Ministry, based on the January 29th transaction amount of 34.725 million yuan, and calculating a commission of 6.25 yuan per transaction, the Exchange should have earned approximately 20,000 yuan in commissions per day.

<p>Various Banks Actively Accept Bonds as Collateral</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance had previously ordered the Bank of China, the Central Bank, and the Bank of Communications to calculate the Unified National Bonds used as issuance and savings guarantee reserves at 70% of the face value.

At the same time, the Ministry will allocate funds to establish a price stabilization committee to stabilize bond prices.</p>

<p>According to Shenshi News, in addition to the 25th Year Unified National Bonds, the Exchange will also trade several other types of government bonds, including the 17th Year Financial Long-Term Bonds, the 17th Year Rehabilitation Short-Term Bonds, and the Short-Term Bonds for Dredging the Hai River Project in Hebei Province. As for the Reconstruction Bonds, since they have not yet been issued, they cannot be traded at the same time. Regarding the method for exchanging old bonds for new Unified National Bonds, the Ministry of Finance will announce it soon. It is said that the new Unified National Bonds will not be fully printed until April 20th. The various bonds will be exchanged in stages starting from the 31st of this month, with the exchange expected to be completed by the end of June this year. Holders of old bonds can request exchange from the local Bank of China, Central Bank, or Bank of Communications within the legal period. The three banks will collect and send them to the Shanghai Bond Exchange Center for exchange and distribution.

In addition, there is also the Reconstruction Bond, the new notes of which have been printed at the same time as the Unified National Bond, but the date of full printing will be after April 21st.

<h3 id="e97">This City, Unprecedented Heavy Fog Yesterday Morning <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Difficult to Distinguish Objects Beyond Two Feet, Land, Sea, and Air Transportation All Obstructed</p>
<p>The weather in this city has been warm these past days, with a hint of the New Year spirit. However, heavy fog is commonly seen every morning. A heavy fog suddenly appeared around 10:00 p.m. the night before last, and it did not gradually dissipate until 10:00 a.m. yesterday. Land, sea, and air transportation were all obstructed for a time. The details of each situation are as follows:</p>
<p>Cars Moving Slowly</p>
<p>The fog began at 10:00 p.m. the night before last and was heaviest around 5:00 a.m. yesterday. It was almost impossible to distinguish people and objects beyond two feet. Therefore, cars on the road did not dare to drive fast, and only crept along slowly. At the same time, trams turned on their red lights and also moved slowly to prevent accidents. Pedestrians on the road were all cautious, because beyond two steps, they could only hear the sound of car horns and could not see the body of the car.</p>
<p>Ships Obstructed</p>
<p>The fog obstructed all ships entering and leaving the port. According to inquiries at the Customs' ship entry and exit office, the Changhai ships that were scheduled to leave the port around 8:00 a.m. yesterday, including the Jardine Matheson's Jihe, the Sanbei's Fengpu, the China Merchants' Jiangshun, and the Taikoo's Changsha, were all delayed until after 12:00 p.m. before they reluctantly left the port. In addition, the Shanghai-Ningbo lines New Beijing, New Ningbo-Shaoxing, and New Hongxing were also delayed until the afternoon before leaving the port. There were also more than a dozen ships blocked outside the port, all of which began to slowly enter the Wusongkou after 12:00 p.m. As for civilian ships, the Suzhou River area was also impassable due to the extremely heavy fog. Those that did depart around 11:00 a.m. moved very slowly and their steam whistles sounded continuously.</p>
<p>Shops Lit Lamps</p>
<p>As for airplanes, since the Eurasia Company did not have any flights scheduled on its various routes yesterday, there were no airplanes flying out. The China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Guangzhou line also did not have any flights scheduled yesterday. Only the Shanghai-Hankou-Xi'an plane was blocked and delayed until around 1:00 p.m. before it was able to take off. Also, during the foggy hours, many shops on the main streets lit lamps to welcome customers.</p>

<p>On the 20th at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Hundreds of Groups Participate, Concentrating User Power, Preparing for Final Resistance</p>
<p>According to New News Agency, the Shanghai Special Zone Telephone Issue Committee, in light of the new charging regulations issued by the Shanghai Telephone Company which will soon be implemented, in order to prepare for the final resistance and concentrate the power of all users in the city, has decided to convene a joint meeting of representatives from all groups in the city on the 20th of this month to discuss countermeasures. Yesterday, it specifically notified the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Ratepayers Association, the General Labor Union, the Bar Association, the Accountants Association, the Local Associations, the various Trade Associations, the various Clan Associations, the Citizens Federation, and over 300 other groups to send two representatives to attend the meeting and discuss the process. The announcement is recorded as follows: "Dear Sir/Madam, the new charging regulations issued by the Shanghai Telephone Company are actually a disguised price increase, and they have been announced to be implemented on March 1st. Although this Association and all groups in Shanghai have repeatedly argued on reasonable grounds, the company has not adopted them, resulting in no results. As the implementation period has passed, users are panicking and sending letters requesting a decision on how to respond and comply. However, the matter is of great importance and cannot be handled alone. It is decided to convene a joint meeting of representatives from all public groups in the city at 2:00 p.m. on the 20th of this month in the grand auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at Tianhougong Bridge. We hope that you will send two representatives with a letter to attend. This matter concerns the vital interests of the citizens and the unreasonable deprivation of citizens' economic rights. We hope that you will attend on time and not disregard it. This is of utmost importance."</p>
<h3 id="e99">Rent Reduction Committee Submits Another Petition to the Executive Yuan, Elucidating the Reasons for Requesting Rent Reduction <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>And Requests Heavy Land Value Tax and Vacant House Tax to Be Levied to Suppress Rent Gouging and Seek Market Prosperity</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rent Reduction Committee, in response to news reports that the Executive Yuan was convening relevant departments to hold a meeting to discuss solutions for Shanghai's rent reduction issue, submitted a petition to the Executive Yuan yesterday, elucidating the reasons for requesting a clear order for a 60% rent reduction. The original text read (omitted above). The reasons for requesting rent reduction are presented to your Yuan as follows: "Request for a 60% rent reduction: The real estate industry earns revenue from rent, similar to earning interest on savings. If someone deposits 1,000 yuan, they can earn 10 yuan in interest per month. The standard for rent determination is based on the combined cost of land price and construction cost, so rent levels vary, but the interest rates are similar. Unifying the rent reduction to 60% is equivalent to reducing interest by 60%. Furthermore, Article 442 of the Civil Code states, 'If the leased object is immovable property, the parties may petition the court to increase or decrease the rent due to the rise or fall in its value.' According to legal provisions, rent reduction is a legal act. Moreover, the land prices in Shanghai are not only drastically lower compared to before the January 28th Incident, but also no one is even inquiring about them. Regulations on interest rates for immovable property should not exceed 5%: Article 45 of the Provisional Constitution states, 'Usurious loans and excessively high rents for immovable property shall be prohibited by law.' This clear provision shows that excessive rents for immovable property are prohibited by law. In addition, the Civil Code has restricted interest rates on loans to no more than 5% and prohibits usury through criminal law. Furthermore, the government has recently ordered the reduction of interest rates on deposits and loans to alleviate the market situation, so interest rates on immovable property should not exceed 5%, which is permitted by law. Elimination of the rent collection system: One reason for the abnormally high rents in Shanghai is the speculation of rent collectors, who repeatedly raise rents. For example, if someone's property generates 10,000 yuan in rent per month, someone else is willing to lease it for 12,000 yuan. Therefore, rent collection is a mechanism for extracting rent from tenants and should be clearly prohibited and strictly eliminated. Reassessment of land and property values: Before the January 28th Incident, land prices in Shanghai were high due to commercial prosperity. Since the January 28th Incident, commerce has declined, and people's purchasing power is weak, so land prices should also decrease accordingly, which is reasonable. Therefore, reassessing land values is the only way to resolve the rent reduction issue. At the same time, the municipal authorities should fairly assess the value of buildings and regulate interest rates so that owners do not arbitrarily increase rents. Levy of vacant house tax: Property tax is used to subsidize municipal expenses, so all constructed houses should bear the obligation to pay taxes. The Shanghai authorities do not levy property tax on vacant houses, so owners can maintain high property prices and keep them closed. If a vacant house tax is levied, it can also help subsidize municipal expenses and suppress rents, which is a matter of urgency. Limit the construction period for vacant land: Shanghai is a major city in the East, and it is observed by all countries. Therefore, municipal construction is closely related to international affairs. Due to the current economic downturn, vacant land is abundant and has not yet been constructed, which is related to social recovery. The construction period should be limited to promote prosperity. Lease contracts should be invalidated: Legal changes should shift with social evolution. The market is on the verge of collapse, and it is difficult to restore it to its original state in a short period of time. This cannot be salvaged by human effort. Therefore, the lease contracts previously signed between tenants and owners should not be bound by them during this time of social difficulty and should be declared invalid. Please instruct that provisional attachment and provisional execution should not be abused: Legal provisions state that provisional attachment should not be granted unless there is a risk that compulsory execution will be impossible or very difficult in the future. There are clear restrictions. Therefore, in cases of litigation due to rent reduction, the responsibility for rent arrears should not be entirely borne by the tenant. According to the rent reduction steps prescribed by this committee, if rent is not reduced, rent will not be paid, and the rent will be deposited in a bank. Therefore, although there are rent arrears, there is no significant difficulty in execution. Therefore, the court's implementation of provisional attachment or provisional execution has a significant social impact. The Three Principles of the People of the late Premier of this party place the greatest emphasis on the Principle of People's Livelihood, and the four major needs of the Principle of People's Livelihood should be listed and emphasized equally. Today, the citizens of Shanghai are suffering greatly from the housing problem, and its impact has far-reaching consequences. Seeing this situation with our own eyes is heartbreaking, and it is difficult to remain silent. Therefore, we submit this document and humbly request that you consider the suffering of the citizens, quickly order the establishment of clear standards to alleviate the current situation, and relieve the people from their difficulties. We are extremely grateful. Respectfully submitted to Jiang, President of the Executive Yuan."</p>

However, it is understood that the focus of the mutual discussion seemed to be the exchange of opinions on naval policies toward China, which lasted for a long time. This record will be taken back by Rear Admiral Takasu and contributed to the Naval General Staff for adoption. It is also learned that Major Tajiri Yuzuru, the military attaché in Qingdao, and Major Nakatsu Naruyuki, the military attaché in Hankou, left Shanghai yesterday to return to their respective stations.

<p>Declaration</p>
<p>The association issued a declaration yesterday, stating: Shanghai is a major port in southeastern China, connecting China and foreign countries. It has a large population and its commerce has always been prosperous. However, since January 28th (Shanghai Incident) and for the past four or five years, rural areas have gone bankrupt, financial institutions have collapsed, and the social economy has deteriorated. Commerce has declined and the situation is increasingly dangerous. People of conscience in Shanghai, with a sense of hunger and drowning, seek to save the situation. Therefore, the issue of rent reduction has arisen, benefiting both parties without bias. After the beginning, tenants separately negotiated rent reductions with landlords. In general, wise landlords, understanding the principle of co-existence and co-prosperity, have implemented the meaning of sharing happiness and hardship, and have successively accepted requests, appropriately reduced rents, and reasonably resolved the issue. Only Hardoon Foreign Company, as a giant in the real estate industry, with houses all over various districts, and with tenants who are relatively well-off, occupying important locations, and charging high rents, the tenants have been petitioning for nearly a year. Not only have they not considered the friendship between the landlord and the tenant, but they have also taken many destructive and oppressive actions, including attachments and forced executions. The tenants are forced to convene a joint meeting of the Shanghai Rent Reduction Committee on February 17th. On the spot, it was unanimously decided to establish the Hardoon's Property Tenants Association of the Shanghai Rent Reduction Committee, so that they can work together to deal with the situation. If Hardoon Foreign Company can realize the situation and voluntarily reduce the rent by 40%, then commerce will recover in the future, the city will be revived, and prosperity will return. Both the landlord and the tenant will benefit from it. We can only hope for the best. The tenants will only deposit the rent due in the bank and wait for the resolution of the rent reduction. If the goal is not achieved, we vow not to pay rent to deal with the situation. We hope that the gentlemen of the country will correct us in our sincere intentions.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Residents of Hejiajiao Request Exemption from House Tax; Went to the Police Station Yesterday Afternoon to Request the Release of Detained Persons; Assembled at the Entire Residence This Morning to Petition the Municipal Government <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Hejiajiao in the Fahua District of western Shanghai is located in a remote rural area, and most of the residents are farmers. The Municipal Finance Bureau decided to levy house tax in rural villages such as Hejiajiao in Fahua, which aroused opposition from the residents there. The reasons given were that roads have not been built (only concession roads), and there are no sanitation facilities or other equipment. Rural people live in their own houses and there are no markets except for one or two small teahouses and grocery stores. Moreover, in recent years, agriculture has declined, and it is difficult for residents to maintain their clothing and food, so how can they afford to increase their burden? The residents had previously submitted a petition to the Municipal Finance Bureau for exemption, but a few days ago, a collector from the Municipal West Collection Office went to the home of Yang Ma Shi at No. 2 Hejiajiao to collect house tax and took Yang to the police station, where he was released after paying a fine. Yesterday afternoon, the collector led the police to Yang's house to urge the payment of house tax and detained Yang Wenbin, a resident of No. 19, and Yang Ma Shi of No. 2, and押候解局訊辦。 Residents of the entire residence were informed and spontaneously assembled, flocking to the Xujiahui Police Station to petition. Director Yi Gongding saw that there were a large number of people and feared that it would cause trouble, so he sent Officer Hu to persuade the residents to maintain order. He immediately ordered the release of Yang Wenbin and Yang Ma Shi. Hundreds of villagers cheered and dispersed. It is now known that the residents of the residence are afraid of being detained and punished again, and they have decided to assemble all the residents of the residence at 8:00 AM this morning, carrying documents to petition the Municipal Government, demanding an exemption.</p>

<h3 id="e110">The China Merchants Bureau Held Qualification Examinations Yesterday; Director Lu Earnestly Explained the Purpose of the Qualification Examination; All Staff Members Expressed Their Acceptance of the Examination Method <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the state-run China Merchants Bureau, in order to reorganize its internal structure and economize on routine expenses, had the Ministry of Transportation stipulate qualification examination methods, with the aim of eliminating some redundant personnel. The staff, however, unanimously requested exemption from the exam, which prevented it from proceeding as scheduled. Yesterday, the chief examiners again earnestly explained the matter to all staff members, who have now expressed their acceptance. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>All Staff Members Request Exemption from Examination</p>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation's qualification examination method for the bureau's staff was originally scheduled for written tests on the 16th, 17th, and 18th. Due to the staff's request for exemption, and their expressed intention to resign en masse, Chief Examiner Director Lu and others decided to provide a further earnest explanation to all staff, hoping they would comply with the Ministry's orders, consider the overall situation, and strive for the development of the bureau's affairs. They also announced a postponement of the examination.</p>
<p>Memorial Week Speech: Mr. Bo-ying Tan Reports</p>
<p>Director Lu and others originally intended to explain the gist of the Ministry of Transportation's qualification examination to all staff during the bureau's memorial week ceremony yesterday morning. However, due to General Manager Cai's attendance at the Municipal Land Bureau's memorial week ceremony, and Director Lu's and the other chief examiners' commitment to other official duties, they were unable to attend. Therefore, Deputy Manager Tan led the memorial week ceremony, announcing that a discussion meeting with all staff would be held in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Staff Discussion Meeting Convened in the Afternoon</p>
<p>At 3:00 PM, all staff members of the bureau gathered in the auditorium. General Manager Cai, accompanied by Lu Hanqin, Director of the Navigation Department of the Ministry of Transportation; Peng Hu, Director of the Navigation Bureau; and other examiners dispatched by the Ministry, met with the staff. General Manager Cai first introduced Director Lu, who again explained the Ministry of Transportation's qualification examination method to his colleagues. Subsequently, Director Lu gave a detailed explanation, and Director Peng, speaking as a former colleague (Director Peng served as the Chief of the General Affairs Section during General Manager Liu's tenure), offered encouragement to his colleagues. His words were extremely sincere.</p>
<p>Director Lu's Earnest Explanation</p>
<p>Director Lu first presented to all staff members the Ministry of Transportation's intention to reorganize the China Merchants Bureau, and the importance of the bureau's position in the domestic shipping industry. He then explained that the qualification examination stipulated by the Ministry of Transportation was based on the fairest method of selecting talent. He hoped that all staff members could understand the authorities' difficulties and work together to overcome the challenges. Finally, he guaranteed with his personal integrity that the China Merchants Bureau would not hire any new staff, nor would it employ any private individuals. Furthermore, after the qualification examination, those who were laid off would be given priority for re-employment when the bureau needed to add staff.</p>
<p>Staff Members Vote to Accept the Examination</p>
<p>After the reports from Manager Cai, Director Lu, and Director Peng, the staff members held a meeting in the auditorium to make a final vote on the Ministry of Transportation's qualification examination method. With unanimous agreement, they expressed their acceptance, and the matter came to a conclusion. An announcement was then made to adjourn the meeting.</p>
<p>Individual Interviews Held Yesterday and Today</p>
<p>After the meeting, at 4:00 PM, Director Lu, General Manager Cai, and the other examiners convened in the General Manager's office to discuss and decide to immediately invite each staff member for individual interviews. It was also announced that all office hours would be temporarily extended to 6:00 PM, and all staff members waited in their offices for the interview. However, due to the large number of people and the limited time, the individual interviews will continue today.</p>

<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Bankers' Association, and the Native Bankers' Guild previously submitted a petition to the Executive Yuan to encourage the circulation of real estate in Shanghai, requesting the issuance of specific regulations to assist industry and commerce. The Executive Yuan convened the Ministries of Interior, Finance, Industry, and Judicial Administration to review the matter. The Executive Yuan then consulted the Judicial Yuan for a re-interpretation of Interpretation No. 493. The Judicial Yuan has now responded to the Executive Yuan with the following interpretation:</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of consultation, your esteemed Yuan's inquiry dated September 6th of last year, Document No. 245, concerning doubts regarding the applicability of Article 873, Paragraph 1, and Article 862, Paragraph 1, of the Civil Code, requesting clarification and a response, has been resolved by the Unified Interpretation of Laws and Regulations Conference of this Yuan.</p>
<p>Before the implementation of the registration laws stipulated in the Property Rights Section of the Civil Code, when a mortgagee whose debt has reached the repayment period but has not been repaid petitions the court to auction the mortgaged property, if the debtor or a third party does not dispute the mortgage relationship, there is no need to go through a judgment procedure, and the auction can proceed directly. This is not affected by whether or not a land registration system has been implemented.</p>
<p>In addition to being regarded as an accessory to the factory and mortgaged at the same time as the factory, the factory's machinery can also be regarded as an object of the factory. If only the machinery is mortgaged without transferring possession, according to Article 885, Paragraph 1, of the Civil Code, it cannot have the effect of a pledge until a Factory Mortgage Law is enacted.</p>

<p>Over Two Hundred Pallbearers</p>
<p>Tang's remains were laid in state on the 16th, so fewer people attended the entombment yesterday compared to those who offered condolences during the lying in state. Approximately 200 people, including Shang Zongwu, Director of the Asian Department representing Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Qun, Zhou Jue, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Wang Zhinan, representing the Municipal Security Bureau, former Minister of Interior Xu Xiuzhi, Zhou Zuomin of the banking community, and Tang's friends and relatives, attended in over 50 cars, stretching for over a mile.</p>

Each pallbearer bowed three times to Tang's portrait before gradually dispersing. Tang's tomb is located in the southwest corner of the cemetery and has been completed. The burial ceremony will be held at 3 PM today, adopting Hunan customs. Tang's friends and others will attend to pay their respects.</p>

<p>The Plum Blossom Viewing Tour to Chao Mountain organized by the China Travel Service on Sichuan Road was originally scheduled for the day before yesterday (the 16th). However, because the weather has not been warm since the beginning of spring this year, it was feared that the plum blossoms would not be in full bloom, reducing the tourists' interest. For the sake of caution, the Hangzhou branch was asked to send someone to conduct an on-site investigation. It was learned that the plum blossoms were all in bud, so it has been decided to postpone the tour to the 23rd (Sunday). It is said that each participant will receive a copy of a travel magazine containing travel notes about visiting Linping to view the plum blossoms.</p>
<p>Also, regarding the special train for the Plum Blossom Viewing Tour to Wuxi organized by the company, as reported in this newspaper earlier, the number of people who have been signing up at the company has been incessant. This is because the price is low (only eight yuan and forty cents per person for travel expenses, including round-trip second-class train tickets, food, sightseeing, etc.; group members receive a discount of forty cents as a courtesy), and the facilities are well-equipped. Tickets are sold according to the number of seats to avoid overcrowding, making it enjoyable for travelers to participate. It is said that registration will close on the 21st.</p>

<p>Sentencing Scheduled for the 24th of This Month</p>
<p>Lu Shaotang, a real estate businessman from Suzhou living in Shanghai, formerly served as the manager of the Suzhou branch of the China General Chamber of Commerce Bank and also founded the Guixing Real Estate Company in Shanghai. Unexpectedly, in recent years, he was affected by the economic downturn, which caused him severe hardship. He and his son, Lu Bingsheng, the associate manager of the Suzhou branch of the China General Chamber of Commerce Bank, embezzled and used 500,000 yuan of banknotes from the Shanghai office of the China General Chamber of Commerce Bank, which was stored in the Guixing Real Estate Company. Although part of it was returned, as much as 239,000 yuan was still owed. It was not until the spring of last year that Chuan Xiaoyan, the chairman of the China General Chamber of Commerce Bank, discovered it and found solid evidence. He reported it to the Central Police Station of the Public Concession, requesting that the First Special District Court issue an arrest warrant and instruct detectives to arrest him. Lu Shaotang had already fled after hearing the news, and only his son Bingsheng was arrested, sent to court, and sentenced to one year and six months in prison for embezzlement, and ordered to repay the plaintiff's 239,000 yuan. The case had already been finalized after three trials. Lu Shaotang also surrendered to the police station last month and was sent to the First Special District Court for trial, sentenced to one year and six months in prison, suspended for two years, and ordered to jointly and severally repay the plaintiff's 239,000 yuan with Lu Bingsheng. Lu refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. Yesterday afternoon, Presiding Judge Yu Hua and Judges Kai Zhong and Zhou jointly heard the case. The appellant, accompanied by lawyers Zhang Shizhao and Yang Linzhi, appeared and presented reasons, requesting that the original judgment be revoked and declared innocent. After the court investigated for a long time, and the appellant's agent and the police station's agent, lawyer Gan Jingxian, exchanged arguments, the court ruled that the argument in this case was over and scheduled the judgment to be announced on the afternoon of the 24th of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Wu Tieqing's Trial for Rape of Female Student <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Due to the Case Involving Morality, Public Attendance is Prohibited</p>
<p>Hotel Porter Summoned to Testify</p>
<p>Wu Tieqing, the youngest son of Wu Yaoting, a compradore of the Yokohama Specie Bank and a gold industry tycoon from Suzhou, was previously accused by Zhou Hong, the mother of Zhou Peilei (also known as Zhou Peilan), a student at a Shanghai West Elementary School, of raping her daughter. Because, according to the interpretation of the Judicial Yuan, a legal representative cannot independently file a private prosecution, the court ruled that it would not be accepted and instructed her to report to the police station. Her lawyer, Cai Xiaobai, reported to the Laozha Police Station that Wu Tieqing raped Zhou on the nights of October 1 and 2 in room 816 of the Bozi Hotel. After investigation by Chief Detective You Agan, it was deemed to be a fact, so he requested a summons from the First Special District Court. Yesterday morning, Wu Tieqing was summoned to Criminal Division 1 of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang prosecuted him for the crime of obstructing morality under Article 227, Paragraph 1, of the Criminal Law. Because the case involved morality, Presiding Judge Feng Shide ordered that public attendance be prohibited. The hotel porter Fan Liang from the Yangtze Hotel was also summoned to testify. The defendant, Wu Tieqing, also hired lawyer Kong Zhaozhang to defend him. As a result, the court ordered that the hearing be adjourned. The defendant, Wu Tieqing, was ordered to be detained by the police. The defendant's lawyer requested bail. The court ruled that the defendant's father, Wu Yaoting, could submit a written application, and the court would consider it. The court then adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Continued Hearing of Creditors' Lawsuit Against Wuhua Bank for Fraud and Breach of Trust <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Chen Bingqian Surrendered Yesterday to Explain the Nature of Consultants and Advisors</p>
<p>Yiye Haitien Employed in Tianjin, Plaintiff Requests Letter to Transfer to Tianjin</p>
<p>The branches and sub-branches of the Wuhua Bank in this city closed simultaneously on August 20th two years ago. So far, although the Wuhua Head Office in Hong Kong has sent people to Shanghai to assist in the liquidation, there is still no progress, causing creditors of the Shanghai branch to file civil and criminal lawsuits against those responsible with the Second Special District Local Court, either to recover the embezzled funds or to request legal punishment. Last month, depositors of the branch, such as Kong Zhongqi, filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Local Court against the Shanghai branch's advisors Zeng, Chen Bingqian, Cui Pingxi, Branch Manager Fan Shaoliang, Deputy Manager Ye Haitien, Branch Manager Wang Jian, and Deputy Manager Wu Yousan for</p>
<p>fraud and breach of trust. After the summons, many defendants did not appear, so it was postponed, as recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Dai Rongduo reopened the court. The three defendants, Fan, Ye, and Wu, still did not appear. Chen, Cui, Wang, and others appeared in court with their defense attorneys. The plaintiffs included Kong Zhongqi, Gu Shide, Ma Yimin, and representatives of the Miaoji Company. Guo Xingsheng, Sun Yanji, and Ren Yao did not appear either. Kong testified that he had a total of 5,000 yuan deposited in the Wuhua Sub-Branch at Eight Immortals Bridge. Gu testified that he had a total of 470 yuan deposited in the sub-branch. Ma also testified that he had deposited in the branch, in the amount of 390 yuan. The representative of the Miaoji Company said that the company had also</p>
<p>deposited in the branch, for a total of over 3,400 yuan, and submitted evidence such as deposit books and checks. Defendant Chen Bingqian testified that he was hired as an advisor when the branch opened, but did not receive a salary. In 1934, he returned to Guangdong and resigned. The nature of the advisor was similar to that of a consultant, only for consultation. Cui Pingxi admitted to being one of the nine advisors, but never advised on the bank's affairs and did not receive a salary. The defense attorney for Wu Yousan stated on Wu's behalf that Wu, although he served as the deputy manager of the sub-branch, did not clearly understand</p>
<p>the reasons for the closing of the branch. The court then questioned Wang Jian. Wang testified that the name of the advisory committee was a special product of Guangdong, and there were no clear regulations in the law, so he did not understand his powers. However, the committee issued orders to the branch's managers and deputies. The branch's capital was set at 500,000, half of which was allocated by the head office, and the rest was raised by Fan and Ye. After the closing, it was learned that the amount raised was still insufficient, and 220,000 of the funds allocated by the head office had been withdrawn before the closing. The sub-branch was an agency for the branch's collection and payment.</p>
<p>No Independence, therefore no capital. Each plaintiff then stated that Ye Haitien is currently the deputy manager of the Guohua Bank in Tianjin and requested that a letter be sent to the Tianjin court for assistance. The defendants' lawyers stated that the nature of the case was the same as the case managed by the Second Special District Court and requested that the file be transferred from the Second Special District Court for verification to facilitate understanding. Judge Dai then ordered that the hearing be rescheduled to the afternoon of the 28th of this month.</p>

<p>The City Song Can Be Decided</p>
<p>After Further Study</p>
<p>The Municipal Government of this city posted a notice in the newspaper in May of last year soliciting the Shanghai City Song. There were many respondents. After several reviews, the New Shanghai Song composed by Mr. Hu Jingxi and Zhao Yuanren was considered more appropriate. Yesterday, students from Jingye Middle School, Wusong Middle School, Wuben Girls' School, and Wanzhu Elementary School were gathered to test sing the song, and music experts Xiao Youmei, Huang Jinwu, Ying Shangneng, Chen Nengfang, and others were invited to judge. A total of more than 500 students from various schools arrived and sang at the Municipal Government Auditorium at 10 AM. Mayor Wu personally delivered a speech. First, the Municipal Police Bureau Band performed, and then the students from various schools tested singing in succession. Finally, the entire group sang together, creating a magnificent and resonant sound. The mayor reported that after further study, the city song of this city could be determined.</p>

<p>Guest's Whereabouts Unknown</p>
<p>Hotel Owner Requests Adoption</p>
<p>The Ruiyu Hotel, No. 30 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, is operated by Yu Kunsheng from Ningbo. On the evening of the 14th of this month, a guest suddenly arrived, about 30 years old, carrying a girl who had just been born for eight or nine months. He went upstairs and opened room 14, paying a rent of thirty cents. The guest placed the child on the bed and took out a small silver coin of thirty cents, handed it to the porter, and said that he had something to do outside and would come back immediately. He then abandoned the child and left. Unexpectedly, the guest did not return the next day, and the child kept crying. The hotel owner reported to the police station and instructed Detective Zhang Shisan to go to investigate. He learned that the child was wearing a red cotton robe, a cotton hat embroidered with lotus flowers, and cotton shoes. She was fat and cute. He immediately took her to the police station. The police chief ordered Detective Zhang to investigate the child's family, but there was no information. Therefore, yesterday morning, he sent her to Criminal Division 8 of the Second Special District Court to request a decision. The hotel owner stated the circumstances and said that he requested the court to temporarily hand the child over to a civilian for adoption. Judge Chen approved that the girl be temporarily handed over to Yu Kunsheng for adoption with a guarantor. If any family members came to claim her, she should be returned immediately.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Taxpayers Association Appeals for Severe Punishment of Tax Collection Staff for Disturbances <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Xie Xingxiang and others appeal to the Ningbo Association</p>
<p>The Public Concession Taxpayers Association has sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局) regarding the Western tax collectors who forcibly collected the spring general tax from businesses such as Xie Xingxiang on Xinji Bang Road in Hongkou. They allegedly rushed upstairs, caused disturbances, and beat people indiscriminately. The association requests the Municipal Council to severely punish the staff to ensure business stability. The original letter stated: "To the Ningbo Association in Shanghai: We, Xie Xingxiang and other businesses on Xinji Bang Road in Hongkou, have paid the general tax and patrol fees to the Municipal Council on time every quarter. Recently, we renovated our premises last year. Due to the landlord raising the rent, we are requesting a rent reduction, which is currently in court. Therefore, we pay the general tax at the end of each quarter, pending the resolution of the rent reduction, after which the general tax should be adjusted accordingly. Unexpectedly, on the 8th of this month at 9 am, the Municipal Council sent a Western tax collector to forcibly collect the spring general tax. He rushed upstairs into the bedrooms and beat people indiscriminately, even shop customers were affected. If a citizen refuses to pay tax, there is a court of law or the Municipal Council where the authorities can file a complaint. How can such barbaric methods be used? It is intolerable! We have always admired your association for upholding justice. We earnestly request that you forward this letter to the Municipal Council, requesting severe punishment for the tax collector." After investigating, the Council's staff should show proper courtesy to businesses. The inappropriate actions of the tax collector should be punished to serve as a warning. We have sent a special letter to your association, requesting that you forward it to the Municipal Council, severely punishing the tax collector to appease public sentiment and stabilize business. After deliberation by the association, it was decided that, as the businesses are currently involved in a rent reduction lawsuit and are delaying the payment of the general tax, your bureau's tax collectors should only advise them to pay at the previous rate first. After the lawsuit is resolved, the amount of the general tax can be determined, and the difference can be either refunded or offset. There is absolutely no reason to harass households. Based on the previous letter, we request that your bureau promptly instruct the relevant authorities to investigate the offending staff member and punish him to ensure business stability. This is addressed to the Chief of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession.</p>
<h3 id="e127">1935 Public Concession Health Overview <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Reduction in infectious diseases, only three deaths from smallpox</p>
<p>Cholera hasn't appeared for three years, malaria is a growing concern</p>
<p>Hospital expansion is limited by financial constraints</p>
<p>School medical work focused on Chinese elementary schools</p>
<p>The 1935 report of the Director of the Health Department of the Municipal Council has been submitted to the Board of Directors. As the original text is quite long, we have extracted the key points and translated them into Chinese for your preliminary review.</p>
<p>General Situation in Shanghai: According to the report of the Director of the Health Department, the public health situation in the Public Concession in 1935 can be considered satisfactory. Since 1926, no severe epidemics have been discovered in Shanghai. True cholera has not occurred in Shanghai for three consecutive years. However, this disease is unpredictable, so the Concession authorities must continue to implement preventive and isolation measures to prevent its recurrence. Scarlet fever has gradually decreased in recent years. However, in 1935, it gradually increased again. According to the Director of the Health Department, the government has done its best in terms of prevention, such as strict inspection of beverages and food and mandatory disinfection. What has not yet been achieved is personal hygiene and prevention, which depends on close cooperation between citizens and health authorities. Furthermore, the Concession health authorities are now viewing the latent growth of malaria as a hidden worry. This may be due to the advancement of transportation and the fact that citizens move to the countryside in the summer. To cut off the source of malaria, it is essential to eliminate mosquitoes. The Concession authorities' experiments on removing mosquito larvae have shown some success. According to statistics, in 1935, 122 foreign residents in the Concession contracted malaria and were reported, fortunately, none died. 291 Chinese residents contracted malaria and were reported, with as many as 15 deaths. The prevention of smallpox seems to be deeply understood by all residents in the Concession. More than 300,000 residents in the Concession were vaccinated that year. This is another record of the work of the Health Department. It is also heard that the number of vaccinations on the birthday of the Flower Goddess reached more than 25,000, which shows how much Chinese citizens value flowers. However, the number of people receiving cholera vaccinations has decreased sharply. Only 198,000 people were vaccinated that year, and more than 10,000 people received revaccinations. In addition, the number of cases of rabies in dogs within the Concession has greatly increased. Although the police authorities have tried their best to eradicate this disease, their authority is limited and cannot extend beyond the Concession, which is regrettable. This year, 19 citizens died from rabies, 16 of whom were not residents of the Concession.</p>
<p>Birth and Death Statistics: The registration of infant births in the Public Concession is considered complete for foreign residents. However, for Chinese residents, although the number of infant births registered has increased, it is likely still far from the actual number. 20,567 Chinese infants were reported to be born in the Concession, including 10,983 males and 9,584 females. 891 foreign infants were born, including 448 males and 443 females. This year, 13,429 Chinese died, with old age being the biggest cause of death, followed by pulmonary tuberculosis, brain disease, and typhoid fever. 606 foreigners died in the Public Concession, 488 of whom were residents of the Concession, with non-Chinese Asians accounting for more than half. Furthermore, a census was conducted again this year, which will further increase the accuracy of birth and death statistics.</p>
<p>Hospital Work: The Director of the Health Department stated that due to economic difficulties this year, the department's original hospital and other construction plans could not be realized as scheduled. However, the development of hospital facilities outside the Concession is still gratifying. It is hoped that this suspension of construction will not be permanent, as the buildings of the bureau's hospitals are already dilapidated and cannot be used. Fortunately, there have been no severe epidemics in Shanghai in recent years, so they can barely be maintained. However, it is feared that extreme prosperity will turn into adversity, so it is necessary to plan ahead. The current hospital work in the Public Concession is divided into three categories: Public Health Services, Bureau Medical Services, and Other. Public Health Services include tuberculosis sanatoriums, venereal disease hospitals for foreign men, vaccinations, and inoculations. Bureau Medical Services include hospitals for police officers and prisoners, health lectures for police and fire department personnel, physical examinations for civil servants upon employment, health propaganda for various departments, and the Moganshan Sanatorium. In terms of infectious diseases, the situation this year is extremely satisfactory. The absence of cholera has already been mentioned. This year, the number of patients in the fever hospital was 1,409, a decrease of 30% compared to the more than 2,000 in the previous year. Only 41 people with smallpox were admitted to the hospital, with 3 deaths. In the previous year, there were 369 patients and 135 deaths. It is unknown whether this good situation can be maintained this year. What is currently lacking in Shanghai is insufficient equipment for tuberculosis treatment centers. The new fever and neuropsychiatric hospital has been suspended due to economic reasons. There is also a lack of dental equipment for poor citizens, resulting in an increasing number of women and children suffering from dental diseases. The facilities of the children's convalescent home should also be added. Regarding prison hospital work, the Western prison has been moved to a new location, and hygiene facilities have greatly improved compared to before. Among the prisoners, except for four who required surgery, all suffered from minor ailments. Two people were moved to the isolation ward, and two suffered from mental illness. There were no deaths. The situation in the Chinese prison has also improved compared to before. A major reform in hygiene is the abolition of the previous cleaning coolies and their replacement with 12 fully trained nurses.</p>
<p>Food Inspection: In terms of food and beverage cleanliness, there has also been significant progress in 1935. Milk prices have gradually fallen, but the degree of cleanliness has increased. In the future, Grade B milk will also be disinfected uniformly. This measure is unlikely to encounter any obstacles. After the opening of the Eastern District Bureau Slaughterhouse, meat inspection has gradually become unified. This can also be said to be a major advance in municipal health. However, many butchers are still bound by old habits and have not been able to apply this mechanical operation appropriately. The food samples inspected this year included flour, bread, butter, margarine, cheese, glucose, milk sugar, milk powder, flaxseed, sausage, condensed milk, etc. The beverages inspected included whiskey, beer, alcohol, vodka, various sodas, fruit juices, fruit露, etc. The general situation is still good. The malpractice of milk adulteration has decreased compared to before.</p>
<p>School Health: The Shanghai Municipal Council's school medical and health work is divided into three major parts: Bureau-run schools, Bureau-run Chinese elementary schools, and grant-aided schools within the Concession. The first category, Bureau-run schools, refers to the Chinese and Western middle schools for boys and girls. Due to economic constraints, the bureau has not been able to fully provide the necessary medical services to these schools. What can be done is only the cleanliness of school buildings and drinking water. The most important work in 1935 was to establish temporary clinics and conduct trachoma examinations, centered on five Chinese elementary schools. However, due to the lack of medical staff, the clinics could not be permanently established, so the recovery of those suffering from trachoma was delayed. This year, 1,967 elementary school students were examined, with 1,143 suffering from eye diseases, 442 suffering from skin diseases, 864 suffering from heart defects, 393 suffering from lung weakness, 1,252 suffering from tonsillitis, and 89 suffering from poor eyesight. The reason why so many children suffer from heart disease is probably because they do not have enough time to recuperate after illness, even if they return to school. Regarding grant-aided Chinese private schools, 2,363 inspections were conducted this year. Generally, due to the current economic depression, the overcrowding of these schools is the most difficult problem. Schools that used to have good hygiene conditions are now no longer good, mostly because there are too many students and the classrooms are not well-ventilated. Some have expanded their school buildings, while others are limited by the site and cannot be expanded. This issue is currently being specially studied by the health authorities.</p>
<p>Summer Work: The Municipal Council Health Department has special work to do every summer. In terms of beverages, the results of inspections of various fruit juices sold by street vendors mostly show that they are not fit for human consumption. Those transporting ice cream are given appropriate permits to distinguish them from other private sellers. Fly control is also one of the summer work items. All major hotels and restaurants are inspected from time to time to ensure that they have fly-killing equipment. All 13 soda factories in Shanghai must also be inspected from time to time. In addition, mosquito control, garbage management, and swimming pool cleanliness are also part of the department's summer work.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Typhoid Fever Outbreak Among Japanese Residents on Shigaota Road <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese-language Daily News reports that the area around Shigaota Road at the end of North Sichuan Road in Shanghai is mostly inhabited by Japanese. Recently, there has been a severe outbreak of typhoid fever, with most of the patients being Japanese. There are already more than ten cases, causing panic among nearby residents, and there is a risk of it spreading. For example, Yamazaki Aiko, the wife of a Japanese grocery store owner, fell ill four or five days ago. Yacun, who works at the grocery store, also contracted typhoid fever (i.e., severe typhoid fever) two or three days ago. Both are currently being treated at Suzuki Hospital. In addition, the wife and female servant of an employee of a Japanese spinning mill have also been diagnosed with severe typhoid fever by Fumin Hospital. However, the source of this infection is still unknown. The police of the Japanese Consulate General are sending personnel to investigate the cause and are also forcing residents in the vicinity to get vaccinated. The incubation period for this disease is about ten days. If fever and diarrhea occur, it is difficult to treat, so it is best to get vaccinated as a precaution.</p>

<p>The China National Road Construction Association held an opening ceremony yesterday at the Ninth Floor of the YMCA in Ba Xian Qiao to seek members. On that day, the surrounding area of the venue was decorated with the titles and performance tables of the various team officials. More than a dozen books published by the association were also displayed for public viewing. Those who attended the evening included Wei Yiyi, Peng Xuepei, Wang Xiaolai, Li Zhaohuan, Zhao Shenzhi, Cao Yunxiang, Li Dachao, Zhao Jinqing, Wu Kaisheng, Huang Qiongru, Liu Qufang, Huang Ruisheng, Jiang Zhongquan, and Yu Zuoting's representative, as well as more than one hundred directors, staff, and employees of the association. At 7 o'clock, President Wang Zhengting presided over the meeting and delivered a welcoming speech, reporting on the main points of the meeting. Then, Mayor Wu Tiecheng, the captain of the main team, gave a speech, stating that the revitalization of the national economy, local autonomy, and the cultivation of good social customs could not be accomplished without the universality of highways. Therefore, he hoped that the team officials would widely solicit outstanding members to join the Road Association, jointly advocate for service to the transportation industry, and use all their efforts to achieve complete success. Former Secretary-General Fan Zhenchu reported on the general situation of the association's affairs over the past two years. The current Secretary-General Lou Wangxuan reported on the outline of this membership solicitation. Then, Mao Yun, a representative from the Municipal Party Department, and Lu Lihua and other guests delivered speeches, offering many encouragements. Finally, the chairman announced that the scores would be announced every ten days, with the first announcement on February 25th. He asked the team officials to pay the fees on time to facilitate the settlement and wished them success. Then, everyone gathered for dinner and took photos and dispersed happily, already past 9 o'clock.</p>

<p>Caohejing Town in western Shanghai used to have a local defense force that protected the area. It has not been burned during numerous wars. The residents of the entire town, in order to commemorate the previous achievements, hold a local commemoration every year for three days on the 23rd, 24th, and 25th of the first month of the lunar calendar. This is the twelfth year. Last night was the last day. All the colorful buildings and storefronts were brightly lit, as if it were daytime. Animated films were shown at the Qiuzhi Elementary School for entertainment. Farmers from the surrounding villages came to the town to watch, and the roads were crowded. The town's police station and the defense force sent police to stand guard and maintain order, which was quite good. The local commemoration association summoned local gentry and merchants to hold a commemoration and perform rituals. Then, they gathered for dinner and dispersed.</p>

<h3 id="e132">Husband Has An Affair, Family Provokes A Tragic Change: Wife Takes Poison and Then Orders Two Sons to Swallow It - Accused of Instigating Murder But Mitigating Circumstances Exist - Judge Advises Bao Jianfu to Eliminate Disputes <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Bao Jianfu from Chongming, in his forties, used to be a broker at the Commodities Exchange. He closed down his business some years ago and is now employed at the East Asia Bank at 299 Sichuan Road. His home is located at No. 7, Lane 240, Hart Road in western Shanghai. He married a woman surnamed Hu, who is the same age and from the same hometown as Bao. They have two sons, the eldest named Zhigang, who is 13 years old and studies at Yucai Public School on Carter Road, and the younger one named Zhijiong, who is only 9 years old and attends Peiren Elementary School on Xiaoshadu Road. Bao also has an elderly father who is supported at home. The three generations live together, and the family was originally very harmonious. However, Bao has had a concubine named Tang for several years. Although Yin and Xing have always avoided each other, Bao's love is clearly not focused, so Mrs. Hu often clashes with him. On December 11th of last year, Bao took a refrigerator from home to his concubine's place, which caused Mrs. Hu to be very angry and quarrel with him. The next morning at 8 o'clock, Mrs. Hu bought opium and swallowed it herself. She placed the remaining four small bags on the table in the bedroom and told her two sons to take medicine after drinking porridge and then go to school. After the two sons finished their meal and entered the room, Mrs. Hu had already collapsed on the bed. They each took two bags of opium and swallowed them before going to school. Before long, Mrs. Hu's poison took effect in her abdomen. Her family notified Bao Jianfu by phone, who rushed home and took her by car to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road for treatment. As soon as Mrs. Hu left the house, the two children, Zhigang and Zhijiong, were successively sent back by people from their respective schools. Bao hired a doctor to examine them and found that they had also been poisoned. He also urgently sent them to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. The hospital received three members of the mother and sons family within a short period of time.</p>
<p>The matter was extremely shocking.</p>
<p>They immediately reported it to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which sent Detective Niao Chengjun and a Western detective to investigate. Fortunately, the two children had only ingested a small amount of poison, and after five days of treatment, they all recovered and were taken home by their father. However, Mrs. Bao Hu had ingested more poison and had a history of mental illness, so she had not yet recovered and remained in the hospital. However, the police station believed that Mrs. Hu's suicide was already extremely unwise, and that she had even tried to take her two sons with her, which was very absurd in terms of human reason and law. Therefore, they filed a lawsuit for suicide and</p>
<p>Instigating Suicide</p>
<p>in the First Special District District Court. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu Yugui opened the court and ordered Bao Hu to be brought to court for interrogation. Bao Jianfu also brought his two sons to court. First, Zhang Dayin, the lawyer for the police station, stated the course of events, saying that the defendant must have been afraid that after her suicide, her two sons would become motherless children, so she took this action to die together. He also presented the hospital diagnosis report and Zhigang's confession written in the hospital, stating that his mother had ordered him and his brother to swallow opium. The court then summoned Bao Zhigang to testify about</p>
<p>The Circumstances of Poisoning.</p>
<p>Zhigang no longer claimed that the poisoning was on his mother's orders, only saying that his mother had only told him and his brother to take medicine, so they thought that what was on the table was medicine, and they each took two small pieces and swallowed them. After arriving at the hospital, he was in a state of mental confusion and did not know what he was doing, only feeling sleepy. His younger brother, Zhijiong, said almost the same thing. Judge Liu asked Mrs. Bao Hu, who mostly did not answer. Judge Liu then instructed Bao Jianfu, saying that the three lives in this case had all been saved, which was fortunate. Although</p>
<p>The Reasons for Suicide</p>
<p>had not been stated in detail, it was clear that it stemmed from family disputes. You should find a way to eliminate the disputes to avoid future troubles. He ordered the debate to begin, and first the lawyer for the police station spoke, saying that the defendant's suicide and instigation of suicide were a premeditated plan. In order to prevent such incidents from happening in the future, she should be warned. However, considering that it was due to great provocation, her situation was still worthy of pity and forgiveness, and it seemed appropriate to announce a suspended sentence. The lawyer for the defendant, Jiang Baoli, made a defense, and the court adjourned to pronounce the verdict on Wednesday. Bao Hu was ordered to be taken back by her husband, Bao Jianfu.</p>

Therefore, those who are not related to the Customs House can also freely enter and exit through these three doors. As a result, some people have taken advantage of this opportunity to fraudulently purchase goods from various shops, asking the shops to send someone to deliver the goods to the Customs House and then collect payment. The con artist waits in the Customs House in advance, takes the goods from the deliverer's hands, pretends to go inside to get money, and then escapes through the back door. Similar fraud cases have been seen many times. Recently, a certain aviation lottery sales office was defrauded of 20 yuan of lottery tickets, a certain watch shop was defrauded of an electric meter worth 10 yuan, and a certain Guangdong shop was defrauded of 20 yuan of sausage. All were delivered to the Customs House, and then the con artists disappeared. Yesterday morning at 9 o'clock, a man went to Shenglong Grocery Store on Hengbang Bridge, North Sichuan Road, and bought five catties of slender sausage, two catties of oily fish, four cans of milk, four cans of canned abalone, and four cans of salted fish, worth a total of 16 yuan and 64 cents. He also asked the store to deliver the goods to Mr. Li's office on the second floor of the Customs House to hand over the goods and collect the money. The store sent a Cantonese employee, Liang Xi, to deliver the goods to the Customs House and went directly to the second floor, searching everywhere for Mr. Li without success. When he returned to the escalator, he saw the person who had previously purchased the goods approaching and taking the goods, telling Liang to wait a moment at the door to get the money. At the same time, he carried the goods and wanted to escape. He was discovered by Plainclothes Chinese Detective No. 87 of the Customs House Marine Police, who was serving in the Customs House. The witness and the person were taken to the Marine Police Station. The defendant was identified as Shen Jinsheng, 30 years old, from Guangdong. He spoke fluent Shanghainese and admitted to defrauding the plaintiff of the goods. After checking his fingerprints, it was discovered that in July of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the defendant wore a white uniform with copper buttons and rented a room in a certain hotel, posing as a customs officer. After becoming familiar with the cashier, he falsely claimed that the Customs House was recruiting investigators with a high monthly salary. The cashier was deceived and gave him 50 yuan for "expenses." One day, he was led into the Customs House and told the cashier to take off his silk gown so that he could go upstairs to check his physique. In an instant, the defendant took the silk gown and disappeared. He was arrested by detectives from the Marine Police Station on the 11th of this month and sent to the District Court, where he was sentenced to one year in prison. The police station then verified his fingerprints with the Concession Police Station and discovered that the defendant had committed eight similar fraud cases in the territory. On December 26th of last year, he was just released from prison after serving a one-year sentence for fraud imposed by the Hongkou Police Station in the Special District Court. In less than two months, he was caught in the legal net again. He has committed a total of ten crimes and is extremely lawless. The police chief, having determined the interrogation was clear, ordered the detective to be sent to the District Court for questioning this morning.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Difficulty in Rapidly Implementing Interest Rate Reduction in the Banking Industry: The Banking Industry Subcommittee is Currently Studying the Matter Meticulously, and Will Consult with the Money Industry After a Concrete Plan is Available <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the matter of reducing loan interest rates, rescuing industry and commerce, and prospering the market, the Bankers Association of this city has specially formed a subcommittee to conduct research. Yesterday morning, according to a reporter from the New News Agency who inquired with the banking community, the above matter is extremely complicated and cannot be quickly realized without considering all aspects. Although reducing loan interest rates is a good strategy for rescuing industry and commerce, the banking and money industries themselves cannot be disregarded. In terms of the current situation, bank deposit interest rates are mostly six percent, and loan interest rates are nine percent. In fact, it seems difficult to consider them excessively harsh. If loan interest rates are reduced in the future, then in order to maintain their own interests, deposit interest rates will also have to be appropriately reduced. Therefore, the Banking Association Subcommittee is currently conducting meticulous research. Once a concrete plan is drafted, it will be submitted to the Executive Committee for discussion and then consulted with representatives of the Money Industry Association. Then, the proposed plan will be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for review and approval. Therefore, reducing deposit and loan interest rates is difficult to achieve in the short term.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Tax Police Clash with Farmers: Trial Begins <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Two police officers, Huang Zhifa and Wang Ming, from the 32nd Squad of the 4th District of the Huainan Tax Police stationed in Zhaozhen, Rugao, apprehended Ding Weiyong for selling smuggled salt on the beach on August 13th of last year. They confiscated a bucket of salt and were taking Ding into custody when Ding's father, Ding Shilan, found out. He immediately beat a gong and gathered a large group of people to intercept them. They surrounded Huang and Wang, severely beat them, tied them up with ropes inside a nearby land temple, and intended to kill them. The squad leader, Zhou Fengxuan, discovered this and sent police to rescue the two officers. He also sent men to arrest the assailants, but they were nowhere to be found. So, he brought the Baochang (local head) Wang Fengchi to the squad and began questioning him. Unexpectedly, this aroused public anger. With one voice, over a thousand people gathered, each wielding iron rakes and wooden sticks, and rushed to the squad headquarters demanding the release of the arrested man. The situation was menacing. Fearing a major disaster, Zhou Fengxuan ordered the police to fire warning shots. The order was disrupted, and people scattered. One civilian, Cheng Shaoan, was slow to escape and was killed. Feng Rulin, Liu Kefu, and others were also wounded by gunfire. They filed a complaint with the Rugao County Government, requesting the Jiangsu Higher Court to transfer the case to the Shanghai District Court. After repeated and clear investigations by Prosecutor Tang Ruxiu, Zhou Fengxuan and others were charged with homicide, while Ding Shilan, Ding Weiyong, and others were charged with obstructing official duties and causing injury. At 2 p.m. yesterday, Judge Tan Zhuohong presided over the trial in the Eleventh Court. Ding Shilan and Ding Weiyong failed to appear. Zhou Fengxuan, accompanied by deputy leader Tu Rong, police officers Chen Jun, Tong Changpu, Fan Xianyu, and defense lawyer Ge Zhitan, appeared in court. Judge Tan questioned them extensively and determined that the case was extraordinarily complex. He adjourned the hearing for further investigation and released Zhou Fengxuan and others on bail.</p>

At Dongmen Road, they noticed two men carrying iron tools who looked anxious. They immediately stepped forward to question them, but their speech was evasive, indicating they were not good people. So, they took them back to the squad for interrogation. They confessed that they were Zhou Miaofu, 20 years old, from Pudong, and Shen Linsheng, 23 years old, from Sichuan.

<p>At a time when a second world war is about to break out, and the tide of economic recession is affecting us first, we seem to hear the tragic cries of our compatriots in North China being slaughtered, and we seem to see the desolate scene after the raging torrents have washed over our homeland. In such a dangerous environment, we feel even more fortunate and concerned about the existence of the Native Place Association. We are not confined to narrow localism; this is the beginning of national unity. Without strong hometown ties, how can we talk about national consciousness? Without the virtue of mutual assistance, how can we talk about jointly facing national difficulties? We can only recognize our goals and start from the foundation. The history of the Danyang Native Place Association in Shanghai is very long. Through the efforts of many responsible individuals, it has gradually become sound. Everything is done according to the welfare of the majority. While thinking about the natives of Shanghai, we are always thinking about promoting the cause of our hometown. Indeed, we have many things we want to do but cannot achieve, and we feel even more lonely in our strength. We eagerly look forward to a new force, the entire native of Shanghai, to join this group and work hard. Everyone knows that unity is strength. Two simple examples will make it clear: the wind can uproot an isolated tree but cannot break the branches of a forest. The overbearing mantis cannot defeat a tiny ant colony. Fellow natives, when you first came to Shanghai, did you feel strange? After a busy day, do you feel monotonous? Are there many problems that you think you cannot solve alone? The Native Place Association can solve them for you satisfactorily. Hometown fathers, brothers, and sisters in Shanghai, come and join the Native Place Association! We sincerely welcome you. Spring has arrived, and we hope that the Native Place Association will also rise up with the times! The Danyang Native Place Association Recruitment Committee.</p>

Now, the Shanghai National Martial Arts Institute has arranged clinic hours from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. daily to benefit patients. It is reported that many patients whose limbs were to be amputated due to severe injuries have been cured by Mr. Tong's treatment, avoiding disability.

<p>Yesterday, Xie Xing Lost to Pirates by One Point</p>
<p>Last night, the Shanghai Basketball Association saw the Pirates defeat Xie Xing by a single point. McLean easily defeated the Eagles, securing the top spot in Group A and B, and are scheduled to face Black All in the final to determine the champion. In Group B, Guanghua defeated Xia Guang with a score of 38 to 29, and Moore defeated Liangxi, changing the landscape of the group's championship. Tonight's schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>Liangxi vs. Aurora University, Group B, 6:30 PM, Gong Zheng Yi officiating</p>
<p>Donghua vs. Zhenru, Group A, 7:30 PM, Zhou Jiaqi officiating</p>
<p>Dai Changling</p>
<p>(Note) The match between the Jewish team and the Yi team has been rescheduled to the 21st at 8:30 PM.</p>
<p>McLean Defeats the Eagles: McLean and the Eagles had both won every match in Group A and B. Last night, they met to compete for the right to the championship final. The Eagles initially showed strong momentum, but the McLean players, tall and strong, launched fierce attacks, creating a very resistant situation. Especially Philips' rushes were incredibly sharp, and Cliffin's shuttle movements caused frequent threats to the Eagles' nest. Despite repeated efforts, the Eagles remained in pursuit, and McLean won with a score of 44 to 20, securing the top spot in the group. They will now face Black All from Group B to determine the ultimate champion.</p>

<p>Pirates Plunder Xie Xing: In the Group A match between the Pirates and Xie Xing, Chen Zongqi of Xie Xing took the lead, probing the Pirates' nest. After Shi Guiya reciprocated, Weng Ren'an and Yu Fei each scored a basket, and Xu Heng also found opportunities, followed by Zhou Dayun's long shot. In a short time, they led 10 to 2. This was the golden age of Xie Xing. But soon, the Pirates gradually strengthened their offensive, scoring repeatedly. However, this could not offset earlier losses. The performance of the Xie Xing players was indeed exquisite, but the Pirates' Lan Yin was truly a fierce character. As a result, the Pirates took the lead with a score of 21 to 19 by the end of the first half.</p>
<p>In the second half, the Pirates' momentum intensified, and in a blink of an eye, they had widened the gap to 28 to 20. Afterwards, Zhou, Chen, Qiu, and Xu of Xie Xing all made contributions. Although the Pirates' tall player and Peel also contributed, Xie Xing narrowed the score to 34 to 30. Then, Xu Heng committed a foul, Zhou made free throws and baskets, and Weng Ren'an scored from the line, putting Xie Xing ahead 35 to 34. At this point, the situation was extremely tense. Unfortunately, Xu and Chen fouled out four times, replaced by Tan and Li, which had little impact. But time was not on their side, and the final buzzer sounded, abruptly ending the struggle. As a result, the Pirates narrowly escaped with a 40 to 39 victory.</p>

<p>Moore Unexpectedly Defeats Liangxi: Liangxi had been winning repeatedly in Group B, showing a sense of supremacy. Although Moore had suffered two setbacks, their ambition remained undiminished, hoping to find a way out of this difficult situation and make it to the final. Fortunately, Liangxi's main player, Zhang Jiakui, played while ill, which diminished his strength. Moore calmly coped and played freely, winning with a score of 29 to 21. From now on, the championship of Group B has become uncertain, and it is difficult to predict who will win.</p>

<p>The matches between Zhongqing and Xiqing, originally scheduled due to their participation in the Shanghai Basketball League, are now rescheduled to tonight at 7:15 PM at the original location.</p>
<p>The 8th Xiqing Volleyball League, originally scheduled to open last night at the Xiqing Volleyball Hall, included two Group A matches: Zhongqing vs. Russian Army and McLean vs. Xiqing. However, last night, Zhongqing applied for postponement because players Xu Heng and Chen Zongqi were representing the Xie Xing team in the Shanghai Basketball Group A match against the Pirates, causing a time conflict. Similarly, Xiqing was unable to attend the McLean match due to the same situation, resulting in both matches being cancelled. It is now known that both matches have been rescheduled to tonight at 7:15 PM at the original location.</p>
<h3 id="e164">The National Physical Education Institute's Southern Expedition <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Warmly Welcomed by Overseas Chinese in Various Locations. The Team Will Travel to Various Ports in Malaysia on the 9th for Performances.</p>
<p>The Central National Martial Arts Institute and the National Physical Education School are touring Southeast Asia to promote physical education and have been warmly welcomed by overseas Chinese. Pang Yusen, the leader of the school, recently returned to Shanghai and will go to Beijing tonight to report for duty. According to him, after the school finishes its performances in Southeast Asia, Principal Zhang will lead the team to the Philippines. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Competition Schedule in the Philippines:</p>
<p>According to Pang, when the school's athletes passed through the Philippines, they paid a visit to the Chinese Overseas Chinese Basketball Association in the Philippines, as they had previously received a letter inviting them to compete. They also negotiated competition matters with the association's president, Li Lianchao. The competition schedule in the Philippines was immediately decided as follows: 1. University of the Philippines, 2. University of Santo Tomas, 3. National University, 4. San Beda College, 5. Far Eastern University, 6. De La Salle College, 7. Rizal University, 8. Chinese and Western Alumni Team, 9. Overseas Chinese Joint Team. All competition venues will be held at the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex. After the negotiations were completed, President Li led them on a tour of various places for a week, and then they boarded a ship to Singapore the next morning.</p>
<p>Five Wins in Five Matches in Singapore:</p>
<p>After six days at sea, the ship arrived in Singapore early on the 25th. At the dock, there were more than a dozen groups and hundreds of local dignitaries to welcome them. All team members stayed at the Kowloon Hall. The dates for the martial arts performances and basketball games were determined by the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and the Basketball and Volleyball Association, starting from January 31st to February 6th. There were seven days of martial arts performances and five basketball games: February 1st against the Weiyang Basketball Team, February 2nd against the Gongshang Basketball Team, February 3rd free, February 4th against the Chongwu Basketball Team, February 5th against the Amateur Basketball Team, and February 6th against the Singapore Joint Team. Our team has already won all five matches, and the results are as follows: National Physical Education Institute vs. Weiyang, National Physical Education Institute 82, Weiyang 43; National Physical Education Institute vs. Gongshang, National Physical Education Institute 99, Gongshang 34; National Physical Education Institute vs. Chongwu, National Physical Education Institute 61, Chongwu 29; National Physical Education Institute vs. Amateur, National Physical Education Institute 51, Amateur 39; National Physical Education Institute vs. Singapore Joint Team, National Physical Education Institute 55, Singapore Joint Team 45.</p>
<p>Martial Arts Performances Attract Enthusiastic Audiences:</p>
<p>The martial arts performances also changed the program every day and were quite popular with the audience. To limit the audience and maintain order, the General Chamber of Commerce stipulated that tickets must be purchased for admission. There were four types of tickets: 50 cents, one yuan, two yuan, and three yuan. The venue could accommodate five or six thousand people, but it was still crowded every game, and the seats were not enough. On the last day, for the purpose of popularizing the performances, the martial arts performances were open to the public without tickets. However, three hours before the performance, the venue was already full and overflowing, and the order could not be maintained. The venue doors were closed, and no one was allowed to enter or exit. Those who arrived later were not able to enter, and they all lamented their missed opportunity. It can be seen that the overseas Chinese felt such interest in martial arts, and they must have had a good impression and a deep understanding of martial arts. Therefore, the publicity work for our country also had a considerable effect, which is gratifying.</p>
<p>Continuing Performances in Various Ports in Malaysia:</p>
<p>Our country, at the invitation of Kuala Lumpur, Jinbao, Ipoh, Penang, and other places in Malaysia, will be led by Director Zhang on the 9th of this month to perform martial arts and hold basketball games in various places. Because I had to take care of the affairs of the National Physical Education School, I could not stay overseas for a long time. Therefore, I took the Italian postal ship "Countervanth" on the 10th of this month and returned to China the day before yesterday, and I will return to Beijing to report for duty immediately. The duration of our country's trip to Southeast Asia has not yet been determined, because various islands in Southeast Asia have sent letters inviting us. For the sake of general publicity in Southeast Asia, it is not convenient to refuse. Our country will perform in Kuala Lumpur, Jinbao, Ipoh, Penang, and other places in Malaysia until about March 4th, and then go to Medan, Sumatra, and Java, Surabaya, and Batavia in the Dutch East Indies, and then return to Saigon and Manila.</p>

<p>The Chairman of the International Committee Gave the Closing Remarks. The Venue for the 12th Games Will Be in Japan.</p>
<p>Havas, Garmisch, Germany, 16th: The International Olympic Winter Games concluded today. The closing ceremony was held in the ski resort, with no less than 100,000 participants. Führer Hitler attended in person and sat on the podium. Important officials of the Games were guarding his side. The audience cheered and paid their respects when they saw the Führer in person. Soon after, the award ceremony was held. The winning athletes from various countries were lined up in front of the podium, and the flags were flying. The flags of the top three countries in each event were raised on the Olympic flagpole in order, and the national anthems of those countries were played at the same time. Bela, the chairman of the International Olympic Committee, awarded the prizes one by one. Then, Hartel, the chairman of the German Olympic Committee, tied the commemorative ribbon of this Winter Games to the national flags of the participating countries. Finally, Bela gave the closing remarks, first thanking Führer Hitler of Germany, the German people, and the authorities of Garmisch, and inviting athletes from various countries to go to Berlin in the summer to participate in the 11th International Olympic Games. At this point, the closing ceremony was completed, and the cannons roared. The Olympic flame that had been burning last week was also extinguished. In total, over one million people have visited since the competition began ten days ago, including no less than 800,000 people who purchased tickets to sit in the audience.</p>
<p>The Chairman Discusses the Next Games:</p>
<p>Havas, Garmisch, Germany, 16th: The Winter Games of the Olympic Games have ended. Count Bela, the chairman of the International Committee of the Games, is scheduled to leave for Japan on the 18th. He recently told a reporter from Hamburg that his mission is to investigate whether the 12th International Olympic Games in 1940 can be held in Japan. Italy and Finland had raised objections to the idea of holding the next Games in Japan. According to Bela, if the Winter Games program cannot be held in Japan, the northern part of the country has a harsh climate and many mountains, which can be used as sports venues. As for the long distance to Japan, it is not a problem. Previously, the 10th Games selected Los Angeles, USA as the venue. At first, it was thought that the distance was too far and that the participants would not be enthusiastic. However, when the meeting was held, the opposite happened. Not only did the number of participating countries not decrease, but the results were also very impressive, which shows that the distance is not a cause for concern. Moreover, the spirit of sports in Asian countries is developing day by day, and Japan's preparations will definitely have good results, which is beyond doubt.</p>
<p>Ski Federation Lodges Protest:</p>
<p>Havas, Garmisch, Germany, 16th: The International Ski Competition Federation recently held a meeting and decided that if the International Olympic Committee does not allow former ski coaches to participate in the competition, the Federation will refuse to participate in the 1940 International Olympic Winter Games. This resolution was unanimously approved by the representatives of various countries attending the Federation. Count Bela, the chairman of the International Olympic Committee, recently declared to a reporter that this resolution of the International Ski Competition Federation is impossible for the International Committee to accept. Based on this, it is possible that the ski competition in the 1940 International Olympic Games may be cancelled as a result.</p>

<p>Appointing Chen Lifu, Deng Ti, and Other Nine People as Members and Requesting the Government to Allocate a Special Fund for Boy Scout Subsidies</p>
<p>The China Boy Scout Association, in accordance with Article 27 of the General Regulations of the China Boy Scouts, stipulates that personnel serving in the Boy Scout cause who have honorable conduct in national and social undertakings should have their facts reviewed and evaluated. An Honorary Evaluation Committee should be organized to fairly judge matters concerning honor awards from various places. The association has formally organized and established the committee, with Chen Lifu, Zhang Zhizhong, Zhu Jiahua, Shuo Shusen, Chen Jian, Deng Ti, Zhang Daofan, Gui Yongqing, and Liu Yongyao as members. The association believes that to carry out any undertaking, there must be sufficient funds to promote its work. However, recent investigations have found that the Boy Scout cause in various provinces and cities often cannot be carried out due to a lack of funds, and the association itself cannot provide subsidies due to financial difficulties. Therefore, it intends to request the government to find a way to allocate cash to promote the development of the Boy Scout cause.</p>

<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott, Translated by Deng Xiaocang</p>
<p>They were all there—Meg's parents, Mr. and Mrs. March, Aunt Tandy and Aunt Amy, old Mr. Laurence, now with flowing white hair and declining spirit, Mr. and Mrs. Bhaer, and the young scholar they nurtured, as well as many friends who came to pay their respects to the deceased. We imagine that the retiring John Brooke, in his busy, quiet, and simple life, had little time for making friends; yet now they came in droves—old and young, rich and poor, high and low; unknowingly, his influence had spread to them, his virtue still shone brightly, and the many good deeds he had done in secret rose up to bless him. The multitude of mourners and their grief beside his coffin were a more powerful eulogy than Mr. March could have delivered. There was the employer he had faithfully served for many years, the poor old women he had helped with his meager savings to commemorate his mother, his wife, whom he had given so much happiness that even death could not completely destroy it, his brothers- and sisters-in-law, who had deeply occupied a corner of their hearts, his young sons and daughters, who already felt the loss of his strong arms and gentle voice, young children, weeping for their kindest playmate, and tall young men, suddenly moved, paying attention to a scene they would never forget. It was a very simple ceremony, and very short; Mr. March had intended to express his admiration and love for his most respected son-in-law, but the old father's voice, which had been choked with emotion during their wedding ceremony, was now completely unable to utter a word. After the final "Amen" (Note), there followed a long, lasting silence, until it was broken by the faint sound of Chrysanthemum Sweeny sobbing upstairs; then, Mr. Bhaer gave an order, and the voices of the well-trained children burst forth together, singing a hymn, full of noble and unrestrained emotion, and others unknowingly joined in one by one, singing with all their hearts, feeling that their suffering souls had risen on the wings of the hymn, which combined both strength and gentleness, to a realm of peace.</p>
<p>(Note) "Amen" is the concluding word of each prayer.</p>

<h3 id="e189">The Urgent Need to Promote Rural Nurses (Part 2) <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Yin Jinquan</p>
<p>There are various opinions regarding the plan for implementing rural hygiene. However, many scholars in our country acknowledge that the only way out of solving China's hygiene problems is to adopt a public medical system. Indeed, implementing rural hygiene must be organized and obtain the maximum of hygiene facilities, ensuring that these facilities can be distributed to the rural areas throughout the country with the minimum of economic cost. Therefore, the rural hygiene administration in our country must be managed by the state, establishing a systematic organization from the central government down to the rural areas. Only then can the maximum effect be achieved with the minimum economic cost. This type of organization is also recognized by European and American scholars. However, this plan depends on the financial resources of the government authorities. Therefore, in this turbulent time of poverty and financial exhaustion, it is very difficult to make the ideal a reality. Consequently, some people have proposed that: "Who among those in the medical and pharmaceutical field does not have a compassionate and charitable heart, and a spirit of sacrifice to serve society? Since the plight of the rural areas is so dire, to relieve the suffering of the farmers, we in the medical and pharmaceutical field must lead by example and quickly go to serve in the rural areas." But how easy is this? Because the graduates of existing medical schools cannot shoulder the responsibility of implementing rural hygiene, either their qualifications are too high and their standard of living is too high; or their qualifications are too low and their purpose is to make a profit. Moreover, ordinary medical schools focus on treatment and pay little attention to prevention. At the same time, whether everyone has a compassionate heart and is willing to come to the bankrupt rural areas to serve is still a question. Even if we take a step back and say that there are people with such compassionate hearts who are willing to serve this bankrupt rural area, but relying on business will not be able to support their lives. Taking another step back, if there are a few doctors who can and are willing to generously provide free medical treatment, but relying on the free medical treatment of these few doctors to promote medical care to the rural areas is absolutely impossible, it is not a viable solution.</p>
<p>In this environment, the new term "rural nurse" has emerged in response to the needs of rural society. Looking at the meaning of this term, we know that it is different from the ordinary nurses serving in hospitals. The author believes that rural nurses are the vanguard of implementing rural hygiene. Judging from the various facts above, the author believes that the following three points for the training of rural nurses can be offered to those who are studying rural hygiene issues.</p>
<p>The selection of rural nurse talent should be done locally: The talent for rural nurses must be selected from outstanding individuals locally (junior high school graduates or equivalent qualifications), and they must pass the examination before they can be appointed. Because those who grow up in the local rural areas are the only ones who know the customs and habits and suffering of the rural areas, they will gain the trust of the farmers and be willing to work wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>The training of rural nurses should focus on diligence and frugality: To achieve the maximum effect with the minimum economic cost depends on the proper implementation, but a part of it still depends on the diligence and frugality of the implementers themselves. Therefore, the words "diligence" and "frugality" should be the most emphasized in the training of rural nurses. In this way, they will not easily be contaminated by the bad habits of the cities, and in the current difficult rural areas, they will be able to work hard and enable the farmers to obtain real new medical security.</p>
<p>The teaching materials for rural nurses should be tailored to the needs: Implementing rural hygiene does not require purely treatment talent or hygiene talent, and it is even more impossible to afford both medical and hygiene specialized talent. Therefore, the rural nurse curriculum should emphasize both prevention and treatment, so that they can not only implement hygiene work, but also be responsible for treatment duties. As for the allocation of curriculum time and all the detailed methods, you can refer to the "Zhenjiang Rural Nurse School," which was the first to be founded.</p>
<p>In response to social needs, Zhenjiang has already founded a rural nurse school. Other counties in Jiangsu Province may as well follow suit and strive to promote it, spreading from counties to provinces and covering the rural areas throughout the country, which is also a good way to implement rural hygiene. If scholars believe that it still lacks a system, then when the country is stable and the national treasury is rich, and the state organizes a systematic organization, this group of rural nurses will also be the most suitable and most needed talents when implementing the public medical system. After adoption, it can reduce the time required for talent training, and the implementation of the public medical system will also have a group of skilled and fresh troops.</p>
<p>We have said a lot above, so we may as well calm down and think about it. The extent of rural bankruptcy has reached its peak, and the farmers are suffering from poverty and disease day by day. The country still does not have a systematic organization for implementing rural hygiene. Under these circumstances, rural nurses are the most suitable for the needs of the rural hygiene cause. Therefore, the promotion of rural nurses should be urgently promoted, and it is hoped that those who pay attention to rural hygiene will discuss it.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Letter from the Shanghai Medical Association <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>To Whom It May Concern: Recently, some newspapers, under the guise of promoting medical and pharmaceutical knowledge, have extravagantly engaged in the art of disguised advertising, misrepresenting words and deceiving society, which has a significant negative impact on the future of national health care. We have found that your newspaper's weekly Medical Supplement, published every Tuesday, and the Medical Weekly of the Great Evening News are both fair in their views and detailed in their content, which is greatly admired by our colleagues. In the future, to popularize proper hygiene knowledge, we plan to contact and cooperate with your newspaper and other publications, providing a platform for our members to publish articles, so that we can distinguish between right and wrong and correct the public's perception. We believe that your newspaper will also be happy to do so. We are sending this letter to you accordingly, and we hope that you will take it into consideration.</p>

<h3 id="e191">The Relationship Between Medical Trends and the Nation <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Songnian</p>
<p>In our country, everything lags behind others. Although we are known as the earliest civilization, even preceding all other nations, with a long history of over four thousand years, according to the definite formula of evolution, the development of all endeavors in an early-civilized nation should be directly proportional – even progressing earlier than those nations with later civilizations. How could we know that the reality is the opposite? Although our country was the earliest to be civilized, the nation's position is now below all other nations. It has already fallen behind. Why would medicine be any different? Here, based on my limited insights, I have summarized several points for a brief discussion.</p>
<p>(A) The Restraint of National Thought</p>
<p>The emperors of the feudal era, in order to satisfy their imperial desires and prevent national rebellions, adopted the imperial examination system, using the eight-legged essay to restrain the thoughts of the intellectual class. Once thought was restrained, how could anything else be discussed? Medicine also could not progress because of this; everything was trapped in old conventions.</p>
<p>(B) Not Seeking Progress in Scholarship</p>
<p>In the medical histories of various countries, one can often see the progression from metaphysics to practicality. The trend of Chinese medicine was previously like the precedents of various countries, but later it ultimately did not seek progress in scholarship. Logically, the achievements that predecessors did not complete should be developed and completed by later generations. Only then would they not fail the painstaking efforts of the predecessors in their initial theories. Therefore, research and discussion are the sources of "development." Not seeking progress has a very significant impact on the obstruction of scholarship.</p>
<p>(C) Not Public, Keeping Secrets</p>
<p>All inventions come from the rational abilities of the insightful and prescient. Once something is discovered, tireless efforts are made to research it. When one's abilities are insufficient, it should be publicly announced for everyone to study and discuss. After combining the wisdom of many and continuous research and experimentation, great achievements can be completed! However, the people of our country only know selfishness and self-interest. Whenever something is invented, they must keep it secret so that no one else knows. This is due to the fact that the government has had no appropriate methods to reward inventors since ancient times. Therefore, since inventors have no legal protection, they are naturally unwilling to make public announcements. An example can be given as follows:</p>
<p>For example, a martial arts instructor has one hundred sets of boxing techniques, but only transmits ninety-nine sets to his favorite disciple, because he fears that if the disciple knows everything, his skills will be equal to his own. With this thought in everyone's mind, it is passed down generation after generation of disciples and descendants, becoming less and less, and eventually lost. Medicine is also like this, so there is no progress.</p>
<p>(D) Mutual Infighting Among Colleagues</p>
<p>This is also selfishness and self-interest. For the sake of fame and profit, they do not hesitate to damage the reputations of colleagues. There is no spirit of mutual assistance, no mutual connection, and no discussion of academic progress. They even take pleasure in jealousy among peers. The benefits of mutual learning are lost, so how can medicine progress?</p>
<p>Understanding the above points allows one to glimpse the reasons why medicine in our country is not progressing. Although the direct cause of decline is due to the various oppressions of imperialists, we must know that if a country can strengthen itself, imperialists naturally dare not despise and invade it. For example, before the Meiji Restoration in Japan, everything was immature. The weakness of the country and the invasion of foreign powers were just like our country now. After the Restoration, they turned weakness into strength and were able to leap to become a world-class power. Just in terms of medical and pharmaceutical undertakings, they adopted Dutch medicine in the past, but after the Restoration, they abandoned Dutch medicine and studied new and progressive modern medicine. Therefore, they have already kept pace with the advanced countries of the world. This advantage of the Japanese people's inherent love of imitation is indeed admirable!</p>
<p>We can now know that not keeping pace with the world's trends, history has given us profound lessons, and in fact, it has already been proven that the result will inevitably lead to falling behind. The country will gradually decline, and even lead to extinction. Understanding this is sufficient proof that the prosperity or decline of a nation depends on the health of its people. To make the people healthy, it all depends on the popularization of medical knowledge, so that everyone understands the essential medical and pharmaceutical common sense and the necessary hygiene knowledge. This relies on the popularization of health education. Therefore, if we want China to survive in the world forever, we should study modern medicine of the world as much as possible, so that the progress of medicine keeps pace with the advanced countries of the world, and so that it is popularized to the people, so that everyone is strong and healthy, and every citizen has at least a little contribution to the country, or does a great cause that benefits the country. Because if the body is weak, the spirit is also depressed. This kind of person will never succeed in a great cause. It is sufficient proof that the success of a great cause depends entirely on a healthy body. The foundation lies in the development of medicine!</p>
<p>(E) The Evils of Stubbornness and Lack of Initiative</p>
<p>Some stubborn people criticize the study of Western modern medicine as wrong. This is a subjective view of those who do not understand the world trend. We must know that academics have no national boundaries. The strengths of other countries can make up for our shortcomings, as mentioned earlier. Sun Yat-sen said that we should catch up with all the advanced academic fields in the world, so as not to cause our country to lag behind, and the result is to reach the path of decline. This is a true and meaningful saying. For the sake of the practical interests of the country, for the sake of the true academic progress, Chinese and Western medicine should contact each other, unite together, and under the belief of science, jointly discuss academic progress. Because science is constantly progressing and inventing as long as it has not progressed to the extreme. If you think that past knowledge is already sufficient and there is no need for improvement, staying in place will make you fall behind in an instant. Those who fall behind are the harbinger of decline. If we want academic progress, the first thing is to understand the theories that only know what is happening but do not know why; break through those that cannot be understood, and develop the inherent materials that can be organized, extracting the essence and discarding the dross. This is also a step that should be taken.</p>
<p>For the sake of the country's practical interests and for the sake of mankind's lasting happiness, the aim should be to popularize medical and health knowledge among the people; gather medical talents in China, study modern medicine, complete the independence of Chinese medicine, and promote the progress of Chinese medicine at any time. Not only should it keep pace with the medicine of various countries in the world, but it must also embrace the ambition to produce new medical inventions like the advanced countries with scientific prosperity in the world.</p>

<p>The facts have already proven that the laggards who drive the times backward, or those who stay in place, will not be eliminated by human effort; in the future, they will be eliminated by nature—just as the oil lamp is eliminated by the electric light, which is an ironclad proof that facts speak louder than words. "When palaces are built, cave dwellings are abandoned; when cooking is invented, eating raw food is eliminated." Everyone knows this, and it is the same as the above example. Now, in order to awaken those who are stubborn and do not know the trend of the times, I will go further and briefly describe the origin and development of medical history, so that the evolution of the times and the new trend of medicine can proceed, which is irresistible:</p>
<p>In ancient times, people's thoughts were simple and their knowledge was immature. They did not know what medicine was at all. When they encountered diseases, they treated them with the rational instinct of the insightful and prescient. The so-called rational instinct is like a dog that eats a lot of grass when its stomach is uncomfortable to induce vomiting; or like an ape that can pull out wooden or bamboo thorns from its body. - If they encounter something that cannot be treated with rational instinct, they just let it take its course!</p>
<p>Because humans, after all, have a brain that is more complex and larger than any animal, their rational instinct is naturally more developed than everything else. Therefore, the insightful and prescient philosophers later thought that diseases were strange, and that there must be gods, ghosts, and demons causing trouble there. So, whenever they encountered enemies, they held weapons (note: the weapons at that time were nothing more than sharp stones tied together, because the people's thoughts were immature and everything was simple at that time). They fought in the air over the sick person, thinking that they could drive away the gods, ghosts, and demons, and the sick person would get better. - This ideal treatment still could not cure the patient, so they thought that the gods, ghosts, and demons were more powerful than ordinary people and could defeat everything, so they immediately begged the gods, ghosts, and demons to release the patient, and then prayer came into being - just like Western medicine before it reached the realm of science, everything was controlled by monks. - This superstitious act still exists and is popular in large cities in China, and the ignorant and foolish people still believe in it very much. It can be seen that the new trend in medicine has not been popularized in the country at all, which is really lamentable.</p>
<p>The above superstitious acts still could not cure the patient, so the insightful and prescient Shennong discovered that herbal medicine could cure diseases, and after his continuous efforts, he used his own body as a test product. According to legend, he tasted the hundredth herb. He just happened to encounter arsenic, which could kill people, and sacrificed his life for it, which is really a pity! If he had known the composition of arsenic at that time, he would not have ended his life like this. Moreover, since he was the insightful and prescient creator, he must have had many contributions to medicine. He was the ancestor of Chinese medicine, and the current old medicine started at this time.</p>
<p>After that, there were many famous doctors such as Zhang Zhongjing, Bian Que, Hua Tuo, Ye Tianshi, ... etc., all of whom had a great influence on the progress of Chinese medicine.</p>
<p>However, the Chinese only know how to stick to old methods, do not know how to improve, do not seek progress, and do not know how to adapt to the new trend of science. The countries of the world are constantly researching, improving, and inventing, and constantly progressing, which has led to the current deformed state of backwardness in our country's medicine.</p>
<p>Before the new trend of progress is produced, because there is no equivalent to replace it, on the one hand, the natural trend, the old and backward, will inevitably be eliminated. This has been proven to us in history and cannot be denied. When something newer is produced, perhaps what is now considered new and progressive will also be eliminated by it. Thus, it is constantly progressing in an endless cycle. It can be seen that the trend of medicine also evolves along with the country until the end of mankind.</p>
<p>Understanding this is sufficient proof that those who lag behind the times will eventually decline and be eliminated sooner or later. In order to make medicine keep pace with the countries of the world and stand on the same level, I hope that all colleagues in the medical and pharmaceutical fields should study modern medicine at any time and follow the trend of the world. In order to prevent the old medical field from being eliminated by the trend of the times and for lasting happiness, I hope that the old medical field should move forward on the road of science together. That is the practical benefit of the country. However, there are also bad situations in the new medical and pharmaceutical field. Now I will copy what Mr. Chen Fangzhi said below. He said:</p>
<p>Academic discussion is not infighting.</p>
<p>Controversy over medical administration is not infighting.</p>
<p>Using position and power to try to eliminate other people's careers is infighting.</p>
<p>Those who are now in charge of health administration should also understand the trend of world medicine, and should not stubbornly think that studying in one country means that country can be a model, and that those who study medicine from other countries are not good. This has a great impact on the progress of the country.</p>
<p>In summary, we hope that Chinese medicine can become independent as soon as possible, and that the trend of Chinese medicine can progress with the new trend. It must rely on the joint efforts of our medical and pharmaceutical circles. It is definitely not that a part of the malformed development represents Chinese medicine. This kind of wrong concept must be eradicated in order to benefit the country. Medicine is related to the rise and fall of the country. This trend of progress depends on the unity of the medical community to jointly seek progress (end).</p>
<h3 id="e192">Regulation of Body Temperature <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Guo Renji</p>
<p>Dissipation of Body Heat When comparing the normal temperature of the body with the temperature of the air, the air temperature must be lower. Therefore, the heat on the surface of our body is constantly being taken away by the surrounding air. Also, during breathing, inhaling cold air and exhaling warm air also allows the heat to dissipate into the surrounding air.</p>
<p>Generation of Body Heat The implementation of life phenomena in the body never ceases. The heart continues to beat, and breathing never stops. Also, during eating, the digestive organs start working, and muscle movements are also performed. The result of all these movements is the generation of heat.</p>
<p>Regulation of Body Temperature When the Dissipation of Heat Increases When the method of heat generation in the body and the degree of heat dissipation to the surroundings can be appropriately implemented, the body temperature becomes normal. Now, because the outside air has become cold, due to the relationship between the body surface and breathing, the heat in the body is excessively dissipated to the surroundings, then the body temperature is in danger of decreasing. However, the body can create a large amount of heat to cope with it. If that large amount of heat is suddenly taken away by the surroundings, the body must urgently produce heat, which is the so-called cold shivering.</p>
<p>Also, in order to prevent the cold outside air from taking away the heat in the body, the skin blood vessels also contract; the skin becomes pale and presents a goosebump-like appearance.</p>
<p>Climate and Appetite In order to create too much heat in the body, the heat materials must be taken from a large amount of food. Therefore, when the autumn wind first rises and the climate suddenly becomes cold, the appetite naturally tends to be better day by day, and it is good to ingest foods rich in fat, because they can produce a lot of heat.</p>
<p>It Can Be Decided When Heat Generation Increases When Heat Is Generated In Excess In The Body Due To Some Reason. The Excess Heat Can Be Rapidly Dissipated To The Surroundings To Prevent The Rise Of Body Temperature. For Example, When Performing A Long-Distance Race, Excessive Heat Is Produced Due To The Movement Of The Feet And The Muscles Of The Whole Body. In Order To Rapidly Dissipate This Heat To The Surroundings, The Blood Vessels Of The Skin Expand And Appear Flushed, And The Heat Can Rapidly Escape From The Skin. Also, Because Water Vapor Cannot Be Rapidly Released From The Surface Of The Skin, The Work Of The Sweat Glands Is Particularly Diligent, And As A Result, Sweating Occurs.</p>
<p>The Determination Of Breathing Also Increases, Exhaling A Large Amount Of Warm Air And Water Vapor. Also, Like A Dog, It Often Sticks Its Tongue Outwards, Because Canine Animals Have Difficulty Dissipating Heat From Their Skin, And Rely On Breathing To Dissipate Heat. If You Look At A Dog In The Summer, Or After A Fast Run, It Often Stretches Out Its Tongue To Increase Its Breathing, Which Is Why It Increases The Dissipation Of Heat.</p>
<p>The Above Are All Things That Warm-Blooded Animals Do To Maintain Their Body Temperature At The Same Level. However, This Body Temperature Regulation Is Actually Controlled By The Thermoregulation Center In Their Brains.</p>
<p>Thermoregulation Center This Thermoregulation Center Maintains Its Body Temperature At A Normal Level In The Normal State. However, When Suffering From Infectious Diseases, The Toxins Of The Pathogenic Bacteria, Or The Products Of The Generation Of Their Toxins, Can Cause The Thermoregulation Center To Fall Into Abnormal State, And The Body Temperature Does Not Become Normal, But Often Becomes High. However, In The Case Of Sustained Fever Described Later, This Center Can Also Implement The Regulation Of Maintaining Its Body Temperature At A High Temperature.</p>

<p>(78) The Relationship Between Syphilis and Nasal Diseases</p>
<p>Among nasal diseases, there are those that come from syphilis, called nasal syphilis. Nasal syphilis, like general syphilis, is divided into three stages. The stage with the most obvious and dangerous pathological changes is the third stage. It can rot the nasal bones, and the back of the nose becomes sunken. The so-called skylight, which is commonly said, also occurs in the third stage. Now, let me describe the three stages of nasal syphilis as follows:</p>
<p>First-Stage Nasal Syphilis The initial hard nodule produced by first-stage nasal syphilis is usually relatively rare. The initial hard nodules of the external nose mostly grow in the nostrils, forming superficial ulcers. The edges are mostly swollen and hardened nodules, the bottom is flat, and sometimes it invades the deep part and the surface. The initial hard nodules of the nasal mucosa mainly occur at the front end of the nasal septum, with the occurrence of reddish flat bulges. These bulges are prone to ulcers, the bottom is attached with dirty yellow or yellowish-white lard-like substances; and they are prone to bleeding. At the same time, there is swelling and tenderness of the external nose, and radiating pain in the head and lower eye socket area. The lymph glands under the jaw nearby also become swollen, and there is often fever and other conditions.</p>
<p>Second-Stage Nasal Syphilis Syphilitic papules on the nasal mucosa are usually rare, mostly a kind of erythema, the mucosa appears red, mostly on one side, and limited to the front. Although it does not present severe symptoms, its course is very long. As for the flat calluses that occur in second-stage syphilis, they mostly grow on the skin of the external nose and inside the nose. When growing on the skin of the external nose, spots with needle-head-sized bulges repeatedly occur on the skin of the nasal wing and nasal septum, appearing copper-red or brownish-red. The epithelium is partially peeled off and partially covered with yellowish-black-brown crusts. When growing inside the nose, it is prone to occur on the nasal floor and the front end of the nasal septum. Often the nipples proliferate excessively, causing the nasal cavity to become narrow. Sometimes the surface breaks and forms superficial ulcers. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Lin Jianxian</p>
<p>Chapter 6 Prevention of Dental Diseases</p>
<p>Section 1 General Remarks</p>
<p>(Question 102) Is the prevention of dental diseases highly valued in dentistry?</p>
<p>Answer Yes. In the past, so-called dental medicine was limited to the aspect of repair: specializing in how to treat dental diseases that have already occurred and restore the function of chewing. However, the perspective of modern dentistry has already tended towards the path of prevention, paying attention to the protection of teeth, the prevention of tooth decay, and viewing repair as a last resort. In fact, if dental diseases can be prevented, wouldn't that be a great happiness for mankind. The reason why I compiled this Q&amp;A on dental knowledge is to enable ordinary people to have more knowledge of protecting their teeth.</p>
<p>(Question 103) Can dental diseases really be prevented?</p>
<p>Answer In principle, the teeth that nature has given us should not be damaged early. If we live a reasonable life from childhood, protect our teeth with appropriate methods, and do not mistreat them, then the teeth can definitely maintain their natural lifespan. Now, what the dental medical community in various countries is diligently researching is to find this appropriate and most effective method that can prevent the premature death of teeth and increase the oral happiness of mankind.</p>
<p>(Question 104) Has the prevention of dental health reached a successful stage?</p>
<p>Answer Although the research on the prevention of dental diseases does not dare to say that it is completely successful, we can faithfully implement various methods that are already known, as described in the following sections. Many dental diseases, such as tooth decay, can indeed be avoided or reduced.</p>
<p>Section 2 Oral Hygiene and Dental Protection for Children</p>
<p>(Question 105) What is the most important thing to pay attention to in preventing dental diseases?</p>
<p>Answer The most important thing to pay attention to is oral hygiene. Because tooth decay is caused by food debris, bacteria and acids in the mouth, in order to prevent dental diseases, we must first pay attention to the cleanliness of the mouth, wash away the residual food, and then try to eliminate bacteria and stop acids. At the same time, we must also take care of the training of teeth and gums. These can all be regarded as within the scope of oral hygiene.</p>
<p>(Question 106) When should attention to oral hygiene begin?</p>
<p>Answer It should begin from childhood. If the deciduous teeth are well protected in childhood, and a good foundation is laid, the teeth of a lifetime will not be easily damaged. Moreover, good habits such as brushing teeth can only be developed from childhood, so that they can be practiced unremittingly and benefit for a lifetime.</p>

<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>In addition to the four symptoms listed above, patients need to use antiperspirants due to excessive night sweats; anemic patients need to use arsenic-iron preparations; this is also one of the important symptomatic treatments, and it is worth mentioning here. The general situation of symptomatic treatment has been seen in the above! Finally, the author has a few more words to declare, that is: symptomatic treatment is undoubtedly a temporary palliative treatment; the cure of pulmonary tuberculosis completely depends on other various treatments. But we must not despise it because it only has temporary effect and is not a fundamental solution: it must be known that the relief or reduction of dangerous symptoms is still very important clinically; like the symptom of hemoptysis, it is completely determined by the proper and improper temporary handling; other various symptoms also have the same feeling. This should be clearly understood. As for how to choose various drugs, as well as the amount, etc., these are all matters for the doctors themselves, and readers do not need to know in detail, so they will not be discussed here!</p>

<h3 id="e196">Finance  April Period Begins; Speculation Not Strong <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Short Sellers Seize High Prices; Resulting in a Decline</p>
<p>The gold market started weak and ended weaker yesterday.  Large short sellers took advantage of high prices to exert pressure.  The equalization tax was minimal, causing long holders to liquidate.  The trend was particularly sluggish, resulting in a decline compared to the previous forward period. Initially, the overseas silver market saw a decline in the British market and stability in the American market.  Speculators mentioned that there were a few large sell orders, but not many buyers.  The forward silver price in Montreux saw only slight fluctuations.  Exchange rates were slightly higher.  London raw gold rose by one and a half pence.  Over-the-counter pre-market trading opened, with a price of 54.5 yuan, but it lacked support.  Dacheng, Wuchangxiang, and others immediately sold, generally at 52-53 yuan.  The Central Bank's posted rates were announced, with both British and American markets unchanged.  Customs gold rose by four li on the issue of monetary units.  The standard gold price was listed at 1146.3 yuan.  At this point, there was a slight fluctuation, but soon Dacheng sold again, leading to a further decline.  Although the opening was high, it appeared less attractive when considering a five-yuan premium for the forward period.  After the opening, there was a slight rebound, but sellers took advantage of the high prices to exert pressure, and the market gradually declined.  Sassoon offered shillings, and banks were still doing reciprocal deals.  The HSBC announced posted rates, with both gold and ginger unchanged.  There were still many nurseries.  Subsequently, the silver equalization tax sharply fell by one cent, and confidence waned.  Sellers were eager, breaking the 50-yuan mark.  Longs were disappointed and liquidated, resulting in a period of weakness.  After the low, bids gradually stabilized.  Around noon, the overall trend fluctuated.  The forward market opened slightly lower in the afternoon, but large players took advantage of the low prices to buy in, easily pushing the price up.  Banks engaged in reciprocal forward transactions, and the foreign exchange market was extremely stable.  Demand in the trading floor was weak, and market conditions were very calm.  The Indian silver report showed a decrease of one anna. However, the overall trend remained fluctuating around 49 yuan, without any special changes.

<h3 id="e199">Securities: Stock Exchange Reopened Yesterday <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>—Only One Transaction Made—</p>
<p>Prices Dropped One to Four Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, February 17, the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, after a half-month suspension, reopened as ordered by the Ministry of Finance. However, because new purchases were not allowed, brokers feared drastic changes in the market. After repeated requests and an emergency meeting of brokers, the chairman of the board reported on the situation. New purchases were allowed yesterday, with the actual items submitted immediately. The decision to cancel the rotation was not revoked, and it was decided to open one transaction at 4:30 pm. At that time, the first eight levels failed to open, and the "Bianyi" fell back, dropping 1.9 jiao. The demobilization declined rapidly, with most falling around 4 yuan, except for the 20th level, which fell only 1.95 jiao. In terms of various market prices, if the five types of unified public bonds are compared separately, they are not balanced. For example, the "Gan Juan," which is a type B unified public bond, fell 4.1 jiao, and the 22nd level and the whole of the E unified public bonds also fell 4 yuan. It is inevitable that the "Gan Juan" will suffer too much. Yesterday's situation was entirely due to the panic of the bulls. If the authorities slightly maintained and used an equalization price, there would be no risk of the market price falling to a standstill. The final market price was between one and four yuan lower than on January 29. The total turnover was 3.91 million yuan. The comparison of the price changes is listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>The yarn market trended weakly, and our shortfall was slightly higher. This was because there was a sufficient amount of yarn in the warehouses, the support was weak, and people's confidence was frustrated. At the same time, the overseas cotton market lacked strength. Therefore, the market price slowly declined. However, the actual demand was still good, and the North China route also showed lively signs. On the whole, it did not escape the fluctuating situation.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Closing Price Relied on Support from Spot Sales <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>The opening of the yarn market was in the morning. Because the price of cotton was weak and the market was not strong, the market was soft and there was a lack of buyers. At that time, spot yarn transactions were not strong, and the short sellers were slightly active. Osaka's three-grade yarn fell 3-4 jiao, but there were very few transactions in the market. As a result, the prices of all months fell by 1.12 yuan compared with the closing price of the previous day. The opening of the afternoon market was still bleak. Changfeng also sold off, and the market price was even more fearful. However, the business developed harmoniously. By the time of closing, the price had rebounded by several jiao. As a result, the near month fell by 1 jiao, and the far month fell by 4-5 jiao. It was found that Shenji sold 1,050 bales, Renfeng 400 bales, Yichang 400 bales, Senkang 350 bales, Tonghe 700 bales, Jinkang 550 bales, Gengfeng 650 bales, Yicheng 500 bales, Dachangcheng 900 bales, Changfeng 1,100 bales, and Xincheng 650 bales. Hengyi bought 500 bales, Dafu 10 bales, Taichang 700 bales, Yongchang 1,200 bales, Renfeng 800 bales, and Changfeng 450 bales.

<p>The sales of spot yarn are still developing. The Tianjin Merchants are very willing to buy. It has been found that all the merchants bought a total of 2,425 bales on the whole day. The selling price fell by 5 jiao. The amount purchased by each merchant is as follows</p>

<p>Hankou 5</p>
<p>The cotton market is weak and trending downwards, and the situation is turning frustrating. This is because the prices of cotton in India and the United States have fallen, and the market has reported that there are sufficient chips for delivery. The bulls are also being threatened to settle. However, Tongji's large amount remains safely intact. What the future holds depends on the cotton market in India.</p>

<p>The opening of the standard cotton market in the morning once again showed signs of downturn in all months. This was because coarse cotton in India fell by 3.5 rupees, and fine cotton fell by 1.75-2.25 rupees. Osaka's three-grade cotton fell by 3-4 jiao, and the market's sentiment became even worse. As a result, the prices of all months fell by 2.5-3.4 jiao compared with the closing price of the previous day. The opening of the afternoon market became even more unstable, because the industry was selling off, and the pressure was severe. As a result, the prices of all months fell by 2.5-3.4 jiao compared with the closing price of the previous day. It was found that Ruida sold 2,300 dan, Xingchang 1,900 dan, Yichang 1,800 dan, Tongfeng 1,400 dan, Dachangcheng 3,000 dan, Xincheng 1,800 dan, Jinkang 1,500 dan, Yikang 3,000 dan, Xijin Taichang 5,400 dan, Changfeng 2,100 dan, Runkang 3,400 dan, Dafeng 1,500 dan, Jinchang 1,100 dan, Hengbei 1,100 dan, and Yichang 1,500 dan.

<p>In the Bombay cotton market at the beginning of the week, because operators in the market consolidated overseas prices again, a large number of offsets appeared, which was quite firm and expensive. However, as hedging gradually emerged and foreign news was normal, a slight reaction occurred. In the end, due to limited deliveries and short positions offsetting, it returned to its rise. Pingguoer and Aoji Aomula cotton were very strong because India had recently been in rain, cotton harvests had been damaged, arrivals had decreased, and inventories were not large. Transactions in Japan and Europe were normal. The statistics for the previous week are attached below (unit: thousand bales):</p>

<p>The flour market was active again yesterday because the Tianjin merchants, in addition to loading spot flour, were also collecting recent standard flour on the market in order to continue loading. This was because the local inventory decreased after the north was blocked by ice. Now that the river and sea have been opened, it is planned to load as much as possible. The large bulls were not giving in, and the factories and all parties in the interior were also insisting on not giving in. Except for the long-term new wheat standard, which was slightly hedged, the recent period was offset. Therefore, after the market was stable at noon yesterday, it turned better again in the afternoon.</p>

<p>The wheat market was very popular in the near term yesterday because of the limited amount of spot goods arriving in stock. The short sellers did not dare to let it go, and the offsetting was very healthy after the market opened. There were very few sellers, and the market gradually expanded upwards. Although the long-term new wheat standard was hedged by inland merchants, the non-industry groups were very greedy. In addition, the weather was not good, and the sellers were also unwilling to sell more. Therefore, after the stems had fallen back at one point, they suddenly saw a tight market in the afternoon. No sales were made before the close. The current wheat merchants once again hoarded goods, and the factory buyers were still greedy. However, because the asking price was too high, there were no transactions in the market.</p>

<p>"The sales of Yantai Green Lowland Rice are Endless, and the Sales Market in This Street is Still Not Good"</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) The source of each merchant is rare. A total of twenty merchants arrived (a total of 5,000 stones of goods). The sales market in this street is still not good, and the accumulation is quite a lot. People's hearts are very comfortable, so the market is weak. The price of thick early japonica continues to fall by 5 fen to a jiao. The Qindao and Yantai merchants are still persuading the package rice merchants to purchase 2,000 bags, but it is not tight, causing the market to be hardly stable. The price of the middle market is weak. The Du Yang-style pointed rice also decreased by 5 fen and became yuan, but there was no honor or disgrace.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, more than twenty shipments arrived from the lower reaches of the river. The sales of various colors are still dull. However, the yuan goods are rare and quite popular. The market price of white japonica is a small number of fen. The force of each accumulation is stable, the yuan becomes weaker, the light rice is allowed a small jiao, and the early rice is short of goods. The yuan price is increased by 1.2 jiao.</p>

<p>The market for Ke Xian rice continues to see shipments arriving from Jiujiang. Additionally, there are ample reserves of Han, Sha, Xiang, Man, and Taiwanese rice. The market's activity is primarily driven by the recent slowdown in arrivals. As a result, business on this street has been consistently lively. While sales to Ke merchants remained unchanged yesterday, there were inquiries from Tianjin and Southern merchants. Sellers are maintaining a firm stance, fueled by persistent rumors. Trading firms and storage facilities are reportedly holding onto their stocks, further stabilizing the market. Yesterday, 1,400 bags of Gan rice, 215 bags of Han rice, 100 bags of Taizhou rice, and 5,000 bags of Luoguan rice were sold, all transacted on this street. Prices remained similar to the previous market day.</p>

<p>Yesterday's trading volume in both standard soybean cake and soybeans was minimal. However, the oil market showed signs of strength. According to telegraphic information from Dalian, prices for oil, soybeans, and soybean cake all experienced slight declines, with soybean prices dropping by three cents. Consequently, standard car soybeans also softened slightly. Soybean cake saw some shipments to Shantou, causing standard cake to rise by about one cent. In the soybean oil market, however, there were transactions involving 450 units of both factory-produced and Dalian soybean oil. Additionally, rumors are circulating that foreign firms are in negotiations, with some suggesting a deal has already been finalized. This has created a positive outlook in the market, and prices are largely unaffected by the minor declines reported in the Dalian telegrams. Standard soybean oil for both near and distant months rose by approximately two jiao.</p>
<p>Spot trading in yellow soybeans has slowed for Zha, Chi, Du, and Sha varieties, leading to a decrease in their trading activity. Prices in Shangzhongguan have fallen, while high-end prices have stabilized. Car soybeans are fluctuating due to market indecision in Dalian, causing corresponding shifts in the local market. As a result, the spot oil market improved by two jiao yesterday, while soybean cake sales were limited to scattered transactions, allowing prices to remain stable. Soybean oil mills are showing a slight increase in demand for yellow soybeans, with purchases of 700 bags of Jiehe soybeans and 1,300 bags of Zhumadian soybeans. Prices have risen by five to six fen compared to Saturday. Foreign firms' sesame transactions remain stagnant, making it difficult to maintain the original price of seven jiao per unit.</p>

<p>The sugar market trended flat to soft yesterday. The Guild's quoted price for No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar for spot transactions was 22 yuan, 5 jiao and 5 fen, down by five fen. Transit goods remained unchanged at 7 yuan and 4 jiao and a half. Dong Chi was quoted at the original price. No. 8 Dong white sugar for spot transactions was 22 yuan and 1 jiao, and transit goods were 7 yuan and 1 jiao, down by five fen from the 15th. There was no change in No. 9 white sugar. The trend for Chao Qing sugar remains tight, with no new quotes. Fujian merchants offered dozens of bags of Da Gong powdered white sugar at 19 yuan and 9 jiao, up by four jiao.</p>
<p>The Sugar Industry Cooperative held its tender yesterday. 2,151 bags of Wu Yang coarse white sugar were tendered at 22 yuan and 5 jiao and a half, with 170 bags transacted. 1,400 bags of No. 2 Wu Yang fine white sugar were tendered at 21 yuan and 3 jiao and a half, with 150 bags transacted.

<p>Yesterday (Monday), trading in the woolen cloth market was slow, while transactions with Western-style tailoring shops increased. Tailors from the capitals, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Ningbo, and other regions were actively purchasing goods. Sales of various types of Western suits were therefore increasing daily. Piece goods stores are displaying new samples, and street brokers are particularly busy. Sweater wool with Western characters on the edges, as in previous years, is especially popular. Eastern goods are considered superior to Western goods. Currently, first-grade sweater wool with Western characters on the edges is generally priced at 8 yuan and 7 jiao and a half, while second-grade wool is priced at 7 yuan and 7 jiao and a half. Similar quality wool without the characters on the edges sells for one yuan less per yard, but sales are not as robust.</p>

<p>— Wang Jingshi</p>
<p>The largest increase in imports was in miscellaneous grains, which increased by 24,174,181 yuan. This was largely due to the import of foreign rice in the first half of the year. Foreign rice alone accounted for 23,877,908 yuan, while wheat increased by 3,018,083 yuan. Imports of machinery and tools also increased by over 65 million yuan, but imports from Shanghai have decreased. Imports of books, woven fabrics, and paper also increased by over 3.5 million yuan. The only significant change was an increase in imports from Germany, the United States, and Canada.</p>

Analyzing the oil category further, tung oil increased by over 15.3 million yuan, with exports to the United States accounting for 12 million yuan. Peanut oil also increased by over 6.5 million yuan compared to the previous year, with the United States accounting for 5 million yuan. Cottonseed oil increased by over 2.2 million yuan. The increase in nut and seed kernels was primarily driven by demand from the United States. Of the 11.158 million yuan increase, the United States alone accounted for 7.8 million yuan. In the textile fiber category, cotton exports from China increased from over 15.3 million yuan in the previous year to over 21.7 million yuan. Exports to Japan were the highest at over 14.7 million yuan, followed by Germany at around 3.17 million yuan. Additionally, exports of raw silk also saw progress, with factory silk increasing from over 14.31 million yuan in the previous year to over 26.5 million yuan. Increases were seen in exports to both the United States and France. Metal ores saw a more widespread increase, with a total increase of 12.8 million yuan. Tin saw the largest increase, reaching over 6 million yuan, and there was a significant increase in tin granules. Miscellaneous grains increased by over 3 million yuan, purely due to increased demand for millet for Korean use. In the past, customs authorities did not require this type of commodity to be reported. Exports to Korea in the previous year were only 2,246 yuan, but last year suddenly jumped to 3,380,530 yuan, which is worth noting. Animal products, including hog bristles, eggs, and poultry, reached over 80 million yuan, an increase of 2.9 million yuan compared to the previous year. Exports to both the UK and the US increased.</p>
<p>Decreases were seen in exports of raw and tanned hides, which decreased by over 3 million yuan. The decrease in exports to illness (likely a typo, meaning "England") was similar to this amount, indicating a sharp decline in exports to the US. Tea exports decreased by over 6.4 million yuan, with the UK seeing the largest decrease at over 3.8 million yuan, likely due to the large amount of low-priced tea already available in that country, reducing the need for imports of Chinese tea. Tea exports to Soviet Russia also decreased by over 1 million yuan, while exports to Morocco increased by over 1.4 million yuan. Piece goods decreased by over 11 million yuan, mainly due to decreases in exports to Hong Kong (approximately 4 million yuan), the Kwantung Leased Territory (over 2 million yuan), Korea (over 1.7 million yuan), and British India (over 1.2 million yuan). The rest are omitted.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Trends in Trade <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>Analyzing China's foreign trade last year by country, the United States remained in first place, with a total trade volume of over 311.34 million yuan. Imports were valued at over 170 million yuan, with the main commodities being cotton, kerosene, timber, automobiles, steel, and machinery. Exports were valued at over 130 million yuan, with the main commodities being tung oil, nut and seed kernels, hog bristles, tea, and raw silk. Japan was in second place, with a total value of over 221.6 million yuan. Imports were primarily cotton cloth, sugar, steel, seafood, and rayon, while exports were primarily cotton, mineral ores, food, flour, hemp, and other similar items. The United Kingdom was in third place, with trade reaching over 140 million yuan. Imports were mainly machinery, woolen goods, and dyes, while exports were mainly egg products, followed by hog bristles and tea. Germany was in fourth place, with a trade value of over 132.2 million yuan. Imports were primarily steel, machinery, dyes, and chemicals. It is important to note that Germany's import value has actually surpassed that of the United Kingdom, and it may move into third place in the future. The percentage of trade volume accounted for by major trading countries is listed below:</p>
<p>Country 23rd Year 24th Year Import/Export Value (Unit: Thousands of Yuan)</p>
<p>Imports from US 26.16 18.93 174,930</p>
<p>Exports to US 17.63 23.67 136,410</p>
<p>Imports from Japan 12.21 15.03 136,410</p>
<p>Exports to Japan 15.16 14.24 82,059</p>
<p>Imports from UK 12.00 10.48 98,232</p>
<p>Exports to UK 9.30 8.58 49,463</p>
<p>Imports from Germany 8.99 11.09 103,385</p>
<p>Exports to Germany 3.58 5.02 28,926</p>
<p>Imports from Hong Kong 2.85 2.17 20,359</p>
<p>Exports to Hong Kong 18.85 16.47 94,893</p>
<p>Imports from Annam 3.97 6.74 59,973</p>
<p>Exports to Annam 0.89 0.98 5,644</p>
<p>Imports from France 2.16 1.45 13,362</p>
<p>Exports to France 3.95 5.07 19,245</p>
<p>Imports from Australia 1.06 4.12 37,049</p>
<p>Exports to Australia 0.30 0.43 2,467</p>
<p>Overall, while trade conditions in China last year were extremely difficult, there was a slight turnaround compared to the previous year. Imports gradually decreased, while exports of domestic goods slightly increased, resulting in a reduction in the trade deficit and a temporary easing of the negative trend. This is the first positive sign. Imports of commodities such as machinery, metals, and timber were significant and increased compared to the previous year, indicating progress in China's domestic construction efforts. This is the second positive sign. These are all encouraging signs that are cause for some satisfaction. However, the increase in China's exports was primarily in raw materials, while manufactured goods showed no improvement, indicating that China remains in a position of dependency. Furthermore, the increasing imports of grains, especially rice, highlight the ongoing serious problem of domestic food self-sufficiency. While China's foreign trade is showing signs of improvement, there is no reason for excessive optimism. To achieve genuine trade success, efforts must be made to strengthen the foundation of domestic industry and commerce, and government policies must be implemented to protect domestic industries. Only then can the future of trade be hopeful. (End)</p>

<p>Life is like sailing the ocean. It makes us understand that we have broken free from the stability of a fixed life, like a ship unanchored, and are floating into a world of uncertain life and death.</p>
<p>A tung tree's leaves will fall after some light frost, but a pine tree can endure the winter without withering because it has the spirit of perseverance. From this, we can understand that in our careers, we should not fear being surrounded by demons. As long as we have the spirit of perseverance, we will overcome everything.</p>
<p>If a person has determination and is willing to work hard, then they can rise from inferiority to high achievement, progressing gradually from near to far, and following the path to success step by step. But if they only aim high and far, indulging in pleasure and ease, they will forever hesitate in the graveyard of failure.</p>

<p>— Mingyue</p>
<p>Zhuge Liang is a deeply rooted historical figure in China. Whether it's a small child or an old woman with white hair, the mention of "Zhuge Liang" immediately excites their interest in his "Zen-like wisdom and ingenious calculations." In the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, there is also a popular saying: "Three cobblers combined are equal to Zhuge Liang." And few people will misidentify "where Zhuge Liang was from" because Zhuge Liang's courtesy name was Kongming, not to mention calling him Mr. Wolong. In the Peking opera "Empty City Stratagem," there is also a line in the aria: "I am originally from the Wolong drawing..." Wolongtu is located fifteen li outside the east gate of Xiangyang County, Hubei Province today. It is not a remote place, but a very beautiful one. The shape of the mountain is not steep, but it is magnificent. The area is not very large, but it is very comfortable. There are winding paths and lush trees, making it a scenic spot. There is a pavilion on the map, which is the Baoxi Pavilion. Behind the pavilion is the Wuhou Temple, which houses the statue of Zhuge Liang. A Taoist priest presides over the incense and candle affairs. The temple houses two ancient relics: a pair of boots and an iron bowl. If visitors are willing to donate some incense money, they can ask the Taoist priest to take them out for viewing. The boots are made of cloth, but they are more than twice the size of ordinary boots. Their gray-black color indicates that they are indeed ancient relics from a long time ago. It is said that these were the boots worn by Zhuge Liang at the time. The iron bowl has a diameter of about one foot and a height of about eight inches. It is said that this was the bowl Zhuge Liang used to hold rice. Whether these are just fanciful stories, I am not an expert in antiquities and cannot say for sure.</p>
<h3 id="e221">Number Thirteen <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Xian</p>
<p>Although thirteen is said to be an unlucky number, my neighbor "Number Thirteen" is an exception and particularly popular.</p>
<p>The reason why this "Number Thirteen" is so popular is very simple: it's because of a woman, a young woman, a beautiful and young woman, and also a top student at a certain girls' school, as well as the only beloved daughter of a wealthy businessman.</p>
<p>The reason why this girl became known as Number Thirteen is even simpler: it's because her residence is Number Thirteen of a certain lane. So when Number Thirteen was around ten years old, gossips gave her the nickname "Number Thirteen." Later, "Number Thirteen" gradually grew up, and the name Number Thirteen gradually became famous, gradually appearing on the lips of every young man in the lane. So two years ago, when Number Thirteen was fifteen years old, the Public Works Department revised the house numbers and changed her house number to Five, but although the old house number was no longer used, "Number Thirteen" seemed to live on forever, as immortal as heaven and earth.</p>
<p>The reasons why Number Thirteen is Number Thirteen have been described above, and readers should generally know the outline. Naturally, Number Thirteen has hair that is permed loosely all year round, with very delicate waves, curved eyebrows like willow leaves, a straight nose, black and white eyes hiding behind long eyelashes, lips like cherries, and a slender body with graceful posture. In short, she meets the most modern "standard."</p>
<p>Number Thirteen is not only "beautiful on the outside" but also "wise on the inside." She is currently a high school student, but she is already a candidate for university queen. The reason why she became a candidate for university queen is not because of her beauty, but because she earned it with her knowledge. Because in school, not only are all her subjects at the top of the list, but her excellent works are also published in school publications. Moreover, she has repeatedly won championships in essay contests and performance competitions. At the same time, she is good at singing English songs and can dance all kinds of classical dances.</p>
<p>However! Number Thirteen is different from ordinary women in one way: although Number Thirteen is seventeen years old this year, although she sometimes goes to social events, it's really strange to say that she has never had a secret phone call or a secret letter, except for formal social engagements. Every word, every action, is absolutely public.</p>
<p>Therefore, although she has the nickname "Number Thirteen", her reputation can truly be said to be flawless.</p>

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 24: A Callous Husband Chooses Profit Over Beauty; An Ambitious, Healthy Man Ventures into the Wilderness</p>
<p>Bei Hai really felt that his words were too obvious, and while picking up his chopsticks, he glanced at him. He saw that he was composed, placing his chopsticks in the bowl and slowly picking at the dishes, his left hand holding his wine glass, ready to raise it or not, and he only wore a smile on his face. So Bei Hai laughed, "Today, I am entrusted by my relative to negotiate a deal. Let's leave this kind of joking for when we have time later. "Buying More" then picked up the wine pot and poured wine into everyone's glass, laughing, "Business and jokes go hand in hand. It doesn't matter. Let's talk about the business. To be honest, I don't think you two are asking for prices that are easily accepted by the owner. It's different with us. It's a bank investment. Once it's invested, because doing business, the bigger the capital, the longer the struggle, and the longer the struggle, the more money you naturally make." As he said this, he seemed very proud, just shaking his head. Then he continued. But despite saying such a long speech, Bei Hai didn't understand what he meant, only drinking wine and eating dishes, listening to him. Wang Baozang was even less likely to study economics. Now that he heard him develop this theory, he just sat up straight, holding the fallen chopsticks with his hand to align them. Or holding the wine cup to his lips, sipping a little wine. Buying More, hearing that everyone was listening quietly, continued, "Business people, since they are prepared to invest heavily, as long as the business they are doing is what they want, they will naturally not be stingy with money. So if these two pieces of land can be bought by us, then the prices you need are always negotiable." Bei Hai saw that there was still more than half a cup of wine in his glass, so he picked it up and drank it all, laughing, "If we tell those sellers exactly what Mr. Jia said, I'm afraid they will not only refuse to lower the price but will even raise it." Jia Duocai pressed his chopsticks on the table, turned slightly towards Bei Hai, and asked, "Why is that?" Bei Hai laughed, "If two people are fighting over a torn piece of clothing, then the price of the clothing must rise. What more for a piece of land." Jia Duocai said, "Do you two Mr. Wang mean you don't want to sell to us?" Bei Hai laughed, "We sell land, we only pick the rich, whoever pays the highest price, we sell to them." (404)</p>
<h3 id="e223">Talking About Fake Medicine <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Ai</p>
<p>Good medicine tastes bitter but is beneficial to the illness. This is certainly true, but taking medicine that is not suitable for the ailment can sometimes kill. Therefore, good medicine is still good medicine, but a good doctor can use it to treat disease, while a quack doctor can kill if he uses it without care. This author often sees advertisements for Western medicine in newspapers that state: "German-produced medicine is a holy medicine for all diseases," or "Invented by a great engineer after decades of painstaking effort," and the advertisements use all kinds of exaggerated descriptions. Their techniques of attracting customers are so effective that it seems there is no need to see a doctor if you are sick. Someone as ignorant as myself is certainly unable to prove whether they are genuine or fake, so this kind of suspicion has not been resolved to this day. Yesterday, I bought several copies of "Healthy World" from the Life Bookstore. In the second issue, there is an article called "Again, Telling the Sick," which relentlessly attacks the unscrupulous behavior of some people in the medical field. In the third issue, there is an article called "Made in Germany?", which reveals the truth about fake medicines that are mixed into shadow films. This not only completely dispelled my doubts from the past year or two but also increased my understanding of the world and made me realize that there are such harmful tricks in society. At the same time, it aroused great anxiety: if good medicine is not taken properly, it can be life-threatening, then the effect of fake medicines made out of thin air is, of course, self-evident. I think there must be many people who are deceived. In the opinion of the editors of "Healthy World," and I wish to tell you all through newspapers, adopt an attitude of mistrust towards these fake medicines, publicize it to each other, and prevent people from trying them. This is a method, even if a helpless one.</p>

<h3 id="e224">The Abandoned Lunar New Year in Suzhou <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu</p>
<p>Time flows away like water, and the abandoned Lunar New Year has passed in the blink of an eye. But of all the times of year, in these difficult and lean times, the abandoned Lunar New Year still has the most liveliness, and everywhere there are scenes that make people nostalgic, used to gloss over the grim reality. Now, let me write about some of the lively scenes in Suzhou during the abandoned Lunar New Year to show a glimpse of what it was like.</p>
<h3 id="e225">Door Birds <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>Among birds, there is a type called the Yellow-headed bird. Although its body is even smaller than a sparrow, its nature of mutual destruction is like the crickets among insects. At the beginning of the lunar new year, bird owners gather in tea houses, placing a half-table on two long benches by the window. Then, they put two Yellow-headed bird cages together, and the two small birds start fighting on the three bamboo perches inside. Often, they fight until their feathers fall off, yet they still can't stop. The winning bird has a silk paper flower inserted on its cage to signify victory. The most valuable of these consistently victorious birds can cost as much as three or four hundred yuan.</p>
<p>Monkey Show: "Dressed like a monkey but still a monkey," monkey shows have been a very early form of animal performance in our country. However, because the performers from Jiangbei only repeat a few old routines, monkey shows have become outdated entertainment, only appearing during the New Year to fool children. In addition to the main character, a monkey dressed in red, there is also a pug and an old sheep as supporting characters. The monkey's tricks include wearing masks, somersaulting, climbing tree forks, and spinning with a whip. The dog's tricks include jumping through hoops and racing. After the monkey and dog finish their act, the grand finale is the monkey riding the sheep. The performer leads the old sheep to a distance, then releases it to run. As the sheep runs, the monkey jumps onto its back, like a person riding a horse. After running three times, the monkey show ends. Although the technique is very simple, it is quite amusing to watch occasionally.</p>
<p>Dragon Lantern Twirling: During the Lantern Festival, with its fiery trees and silver flowers, it is said to be the time when folk light their lanterns. However, the lively scene of beautifully painted lanterns is rarely seen these days. Yet, the dragon lantern twirling still exists in a couple of places. The dragon lantern is made of sections of gauze, with a dragon head and tail attached to both ends. When twirling, a skilled performer can make it move smoothly and freely, soaring and turning, truly resembling a living dragon. When such a dragon lantern walks down the street, the person at the front beats the "N鬧元宵" gong (羅鼓正在月裏敲打的,人名鬧元宵). When shops on the street see the dragon lantern coming, some set off firecrackers to welcome it. The dragon lantern stops and dances when firecrackers are set off, waiting until the firecrackers are finished before moving forward. Therefore, the more firecrackers set off, the more lively the dragon lantern becomes, with the sound of gongs and drums, and the crackling of firecrackers, decorating the special scene of the Lantern Festival with the dancing dragon lantern.</p>
<p>Literary Riddles: Literary riddles, or "文虎," are word games in which scholars guess the meaning. This year, literary riddles are particularly active in Suzhou, with two places where lanterns are hung with riddles. One place is the Lejun Society in Gongxiang, organized by a group of old gentlemen including Yuan Jinqiu and Cheng Zhanjiang. Although the poetry strips are somewhat profound, some of the colloquial phrases are quite interesting. For example, "Young age, accepting disciples," which guesses "Little person, old head." "This year's Canal is not doing well," which guesses "Lotus flower, young master." "Embroidered red water caltrop under the skirt," which guesses "Small character" (Suzhou dialect for "child"). One word hits the mark, causing everyone to laugh. The other place is the People's Education Hall in front of the old school, but the riddles there are not very clever, such as "Not afraid of fire," which guesses "Wok." It is very much like riddles guessed by children.</p>
<p>The New Year scene in Suzhou is, of course, not limited to the above. However, times have changed. Besides burning incense for stars, eating Yuanbao tea, and visiting the Wumiao Temple on New Year's Day, in the past, the young masters outside the city gates would take their favorite prostitutes and ride around in decorated carriages on the road. Ten years ago, there was a lively scene of "cars flowing like water, horses like dragons." But in recent years, the money-spending young masters have become too few, and as for the prostitutes, public prostitution has not yet been implemented, and private prostitution is being strictly arrested. This trend of riding around in carriages has disappeared on its own. However, during the New Year, movie theaters everywhere are crowded with a large number of audiences, which is unusually lively, replacing the prosperity of the past.</p>

<h3 id="e226">A Glimpse of the Congee Kitchen <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>Every winter, philanthropists in Shanghai, in addition to opening shelters for the cold, also routinely open congee kitchens. This year is, of course, no exception. The congee kitchen run by the Zhabei Charity Group is still on Liuying Road. I made a special trip to get up early one day and hired a rickshaw to go to Liuying Road to visit because I knew that the congee distribution time was set from 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM every day. If I went late, I was afraid I wouldn't see the turbulent crowd of refugees.</p>
<p>It was really scary! When the fortunate ones in the city are lying in warm quilts, having their sweet dreams, and still don't know it's dawn, the front of the congee kitchen on Liuying Road is already crowded with countless hungry people. Even if it's not 10,000, it must be at least seven or eight thousand people. Looking from afar, I could only see heads moving and the sound of people boiling. Among these people, there are men, women, old people, and even children. Everyone is holding a tin can, a broken washbasin, or something similar to hold the congee.</p>
<p>It is said that most of these people have been waiting here since three or four o'clock the night before because they are afraid that they will not get congee if they are late. If they squeeze to the front, they can go in first, get the congee, and come out earlier, so they don't have to worry.</p>
<p>Inside the congee kitchen, there are several large vats buried in the mud. Rice is poured into the vats by the peck and cooked. One side is the entrance, and the other side is the exit. Adults get three scoops, and children get two scoops. The people who come in have empty tin cans and washbasins, but when they go out, these things are filled with hot white congee. Everyone who gets congee will show a smile on their face and hold it out. Some sit on the side of the road and eat before they can leave. If someone is not careful and the container of congee is overturned, they will pick up the congee with both hands on the ground, regardless of whether it is mixed with mud and salt.</p>
<p>One batch comes out, and another batch goes in. The people who want congee keep coming one after another. It is said that an average of three or four thousand piculs of rice are burned every day. This year, the congee kitchen, like the cold shelter, also feels the reduction of philanthropists and the lack of funding. Therefore, no one dares to determine how long it will be run. One day, when the donated money is used up, it will be closed. This group of hungry people will disperse until the congee distribution period is over, and the next morning, there will be such a turmoil again.</p>

<h3 id="e227">Thoughts on Reading History <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Ge</p>
<p>I don't know why myself, but recently I have become very interested in reading history. In a thin book, from the primitive tribal society to the recent so-called capitalist society, this long period of historical facts, although brief, has after all been shown to me in a hurried manner.</p>
<p>The first thing that makes me feel is that what is called history seems to be a realistic portrayal of human beings constantly killing each other. In the era of commercial capitalism, the killing of natives in the colonies was often counted in the tens of thousands. Furthermore, from the evolution of commercial capitalism, there is the historical fact of the "sheep eating people" in England. Further, there is the so-called "育天 massacre" in France in 1848. Under the cruelty of Jacques, 50,000 people were killed in five days. … It makes me feel, what is the difference between humans and beasts?</p>
<p>The second thing that makes me feel is that every major large-scale killing has ultimately made some progress in society. Blood and the evolution of society are inseparable. What else is there besides blood to demand the advancement of a society, to demand the further perfection of human happiness? One drop of blood shed is one step forward for society, and human happiness is more complete. The value of blood lies here.</p>
<p>The third thing that makes me feel is that I feel our own era. It turns out that we are also creating history. In future history, the number of people killed may be several times more than the past "50,000". It is not uncommon for a bomb to kill thousands of people, and the killing of poison gas is even more indescribable. … Although these things make me a little chilled, when I think that future generations will feel the same way when they read this period of history, that "blood is related to the evolution of society and the further perfection of human happiness," I am also pleased.</p>
<p>Yes, the fate that history gives us is like this, but on the contrary, we are creating an even more glorious history!</p>
<h3 id="e228">Night in Xiwei <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Ge</p>
<p>—One of the Drifting Notes</p>
<p>Stepping into the thin city tower of Xiwei City, it was already close to the twilight of dusk.</p>
<p>This mountain city, which grew up in a remote area, is not so strange to me. Last spring, I rushed up the mountain with a load of foreign goods. I heard that the battle took place at Jieguaan Pavilion. I stayed here for a week or two. The area of this city is probably less than three square miles, but there are four streets in the east, west, north, and south that are not so monotonous. The streets are filled with horse manure all year round. Dead rats, meat bones, and some piles of garbage that make people feel unpleasant at first sight.</p>
<p>I remembered that when I stayed here last year, I spent the night in a small inn at the bottom of Jitingjiao. It was opened by a young couple from Yongchun. The accommodation was cheap and the service was attentive. Why not go there to stay again? So, I went straight to Jitingjiao. Everything in Jitingjiao was as before, but the inn named "Daxing Inn," which was hung with a red paper and crookedly written, was gone. I was suspicious and thought I had gone the wrong way, so I ran back and forth on the street.</p>
<p>At the door of a tile house, I felt someone greeting me from behind from a distance. I turned around and saw a middle-aged woman with a high-heeled head and a black gown and trousers coming out from a door with a bamboo curtain, smiling and softly asking:</p>
<p>"Are you looking for a place to stay?" I nodded, and then I heard her say, "Daxing Inn has been closed for some time. Although we don't have a sign, we are the same as them!" Seeing that the evening was already deep, and she also seemed to be a business person, I agreed and followed her in.</p>
<p>This is a three-section tile house, which is obviously empty because no one has been moving for a long time. She took me to a guest room and then excused herself to go to the kitchen to cook water for me to wash my feet. After taking off the burden from my back and taking off the straw shoes on my feet that were covered with yellow dust, I really felt too tired. Lying on the bed, I felt a little drowsy.</p>
<p>At this time, the night had become dark, and the gray darkness filled the empty surroundings. Suddenly, I heard a tired cry of a baby, faintly coming from the kitchen, followed by a burst of dry coughs and muttering, which made me feel terrified and suspicious. I secretly got up from the bed and peered out through the glass on the bamboo window. In the mysterious blur, I found a pale monster wriggling in the dark. My heart was grabbed by a feeling of terror and beating. But when I looked closely, I understood everything. At this time, the monster was gradually groping over, and the crutches were hitting the ground, making clear sounds. Finally, he groped into my room and timidly asked in a soft voice, "Guest, has Ah Bei's mother not come to add fire here yet?" I replied that it didn't matter, and it was very suitable to rest in the dark.</p>
<p>"She is really too busy. She has to entertain guests and take care of her sick child; but what can be done! Since the Quanzhou-Xiwei car road opened last year, we can't afford to hire a partner. You, the guest, of course, know that the passing guests all take the main road, which is close and convenient. It's just hard for us business people. Just take the 'Daxing' inn in Jitingjiao, for example. It went bankrupt because it couldn't maintain its business. …" After the old man finished speaking, he sighed softly and fell silent. After a while, he groped in his pocket for a long time before taking out a box of self-lighting fire, and told me to light the lamp, the oil lamp was on the bed frame. I scratched a self-lighting fire and found the oil lamp and lit it. The spark flickered weakly for a while, and then slowly brightened. At this time, I realized that he was originally a blind man.</p>
<p>"Uncle, you must be over seventy this year!" I asked him:</p>
<p>"What's the use of being over seventy? When a person gets old, they have nothing. As the saying goes, a broken straw shoe plugs the table leg, and a broken straw shoe also has its use, but a disabled old man is useless. He eats three meals a day and waits to die! …" He was very excited, and his tone stirred him slightly, and his blind eyes flickered under the light. At this time, the middle-aged woman with the high-heeled head had come out and said that the water was boiled and asked me to go in and wash. So I took out a pair of cloth shoes from the bag and followed her in, and the old man sat on the edge of the bed thinking silently.</p>
<p>When I came out after washing my hands and feet, the old man had already groped out of the room with his crutches. In the middle of the night, I was suddenly awakened by a noise. After listening carefully, I realized that it was coming from the kitchen. There was a voice that seemed to be that of the middle-aged woman, shouting:</p>
<p>"You heartless ghost, do you still want to hide it? There will be no rice tomorrow, and Ah Bei has to see a doctor"...</p>
<p>"Ah Bei's mother, there is only this little bit in the bag! ..." The old man timidly defended, followed by a silence.</p>
<p>This woke me up from my dream. I thought I had been stolen, so I lit the lamp and secretly got up from the bed, opened the bag to see, and realized that the bag of copper coins was gone.</p>
<p>I managed to get through the night. The next morning, I was leaving early. The blind old man also specially sent me out with his crutches, and begged me in a close tone: "Guest, when you pass by next time, stop by and sit down! …"</p>
<h3 id="e229">Third-Class Prostitutes <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Guo Ka</p>
<p>—One of the Qingdao Scenery—</p>
<p>One summer, by a chance opportunity, I avoided the scorching heat of the whole summer next to a factory in Qingdao Dongzhen. The reason for using the word "避暑" (avoid the heat) here is entirely due to the associative effect of habit, because Qingdao has a special relationship with the concept of "避暑" like Qinhuangdao and Beidaihe. However, if you say that you are avoiding the heat in Qingdao Dongzhen, people who are familiar with this place may secretly laugh, because this place is completely under the shelter of some factory chimneys, the houses are short, the air is noisy, and the people who live here may not have a good mood to "avoid the heat".</p>
<p>Speaking of me living here, most of the daytime is spent in the stuffy cabin, listening to the roar of the big machines in a nearby beer factory: in the evening, after dinner, the weather is often half-bright and half-dark, like being covered with a piece of light gray yarn, everything is hazy and quiet, at this time, I often go to the road to wander because my stomach is a little full after dinner. This is the most comfortable time of the day.</p>
<p>One evening, when I was wandering aimlessly on the road with a friend who lived with me, he suddenly said:</p>
<p>"Let's go, I'll take you to a fresh place to stroll around."</p>
<p>"Where are you going?"</p>
<p>"You don't have to worry about it, you haven't seen it anyway."</p>
<p>I could only follow him curiously, thinking: such a factory area, besides friends in short clothes, are still friends in short clothes, what new toys can there be?</p>
<p>After walking for a long time on a road with sparse electric lights and a bit of fishy and sweaty smell, we ended up on a narrow street paved with pebbles. On both sides of the street were completely short bungalows. Each door had a round door lamp, and each lamp had an eye-catching small red character: "Third-Class Prostitute" Under the lamp, the first thing that came into my eyes was a pale white face. No matter how much this face was concealed by powder, it could not cover up the haggardness and aging, high cheekbones, sharp chin, and it looked like it was in its forties. When I saw people, I still smiled, but how terrible that kind of smile was! Under the dark silhouette, it looked like a gloomy ghost!</p>
<p>I curiously peeped forward, and there were such shadows under each lamp, some were lonely, some were in a pile of four or five; red pants, powdered faces, some looked like little girls who had just come from the countryside, with bound feet and combed small braids, and there was an unnatural smile on their gloomy faces. Some of the rooms were dark, and some could see a corner of a pink bedding from the window.</p>
<p>Yes, besides the terrible components, there is considerable seduction!</p>
<p>That friend quietly said meaningfully:</p>
<p>"This is the place. Haven't been here before, have you?"</p>
<p>This is definitely the first time I have been to this place! The street is dirty and uneven, and there is a burst of unpleasant smell, and often you will step on some wet things under your feet. Many workers are wandering around, they are bare-chested, tilted with cigarettes, and their eyes are glancing sideways to both sides.</p>
<p>In front of a door, there was a woman over middle age, - that's probably the procuress? - tall, with a cake face, and raised a pair of cow horn-like big feet that were more than half a foot long, patting the back of a worker's head and shouting:</p>
<p>"Ha child, you're here!" She then turned her head and shouted to those monster-like women, "Quick, quick!"</p>
<p>So the worker was swarmed into the small house.</p>
<p>Before this scene was finished, that friend suddenly pouted his chin and said:</p>
<p>"Look!"</p>
<p>In front of us, a little girl of fifteen or sixteen years old was twisting and pulling the corner of a worker's clothes. The worker was deliberately teasing her, and several people beside him shouted: "Good!"</p>
<p>Hearing this sound makes people feel horrified!</p>
<p>As a result, we left there with a horrified mood. After walking a long road silently, I re-asked that friend:</p>
<p>"What is this place called?"</p>
<p>"Third-class prostitutes, - that is, what is said (lowly)! A dozen copper plates can drink tea, and a few cents can do it once."</p>
<p>After a while, he said again:</p>
<p>"If you have the courage, I'll take you in to see it again one day."</p>
<p>I didn't answer him, I didn't know what to say.</p>
<h3 id="e230">Nonsense <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— (Fool)</p>
<p>Through the efforts of Ambassador Arimasa, who returned to China yesterday, cherry seedlings were sent to China from Yokohama today on the Rokko Maru as a symbol of Sino-Japanese friendship. The city of Tokyo donated 5,000 branches to Nanjing and 500 branches to Shanghai. Tan Lao San said that Japan had forcibly occupied the four northeastern provinces and wanted to take the five northern provinces. Are these 5,500 seedlings the reward for the nine provinces? It is really absurd. I wonder how the brilliant Japanese diplomats came up with it. Or, it has another meaning, wanting to turn Nanjing and Shanghai into cherry blossom cities.</p>
<p>The new auxiliary coins have just come out, and counterfeit auxiliary coins have already been discovered. Tan Lao San said that I admire their agility in taking advantage of the situation, but the serious disruption of the new auxiliary currency system has unfolded before our eyes, which is a difficult thing.</p>
<h3 id="e231">Pen <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Mu</p>
<p>Isn't it? In this world, what is worthy of my gratitude and has given me endless warmth and comfort is this pen. Since I took it in my hand from a small rectangular box, I have seen its weight, and my dim and dull life has suddenly become rich and active. I take it with me, drifting and wandering all over the world, and never let it leave the messy desk for a day or an evening, let it lie quietly, with fiery enthusiasm, on it, accompanied by ink bottles, pieces of paper, books, lonely years, and sad and happy life. On stormy nights, after crying and laughing, how sincere, gentle, and considerate it is, writing out for me</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>The words that I love to read and are moved by... Can I not be moved? In this world, there is no second person who can treat me like it.</p>
<p>I also believe that it will never get tired. When it is put down from my hand, I secretly bless it in the quiet lamplight.</p>
<h3 id="e232">The Orange Seller <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Da</p>
<p>"Papa, buy me a paper lantern, — a butterfly, prettier and bigger than last year's; and, and a string of 'hundred sons' firecrackers!..."</p>
<p>The little girl saw her father step over the threshold, abandoned her companion A'gen, and limped towards her father, grabbing the corner of his rough cotton short coat, staring with two clear black eyes, murmuring incessantly.</p>
<p>Zhi Xingbo put down the heavy load on his shoulders, sat down on a small stool under the eaves, his mouth wide open, revealing a few broken teeth, panting heavily; he unbuttoned his cotton coat, took off the dilapidated felt hat from his head, fanning himself vigorously, sweat beads like countless grains of sand oozing from his forehead.</p>
<p>Thinking that the Lantern Festival was just around the corner, he should buy a paper lantern for his son and daughter, as he had promised. However... he saw the innocent look on his son's face and felt extremely sad, hanging his head in repentance.</p>
<p>His wife came out of the kitchen, her small, pointed feet seemingly unable to support the weight of her body, making it difficult for her to walk without a limp. She walked up to Zhi Xingbo, scrutinized the pile of orange-yellow tangerines at his feet, and asked hesitantly:</p>
<p>"Xingbo's dad, why haven't you gone to the early market yet?... Tomorrow, tomorrow is the Lantern Festival! Maybe the price of tangerines will be higher these days!" Her voice was so soft, a little unnatural, the words slowly and softly slipping out of her mouth.</p>
<p>Zhi Xingbo's ancestors had passed down a few acres of tangerine orchards. Since then, Zhi Xingbo had inherited the legacy of his ancestors, working hard all year round. Naturally, the family's annual expenses depended on the fruits of the tangerine trees in these few acres of orchards. Every winter, when the tangerine orchards were full of tangerines, hanging heavily and greenly on the branches, Zhi Xingbo always felt as happy and joyful as if he had raised a son! At the same time, he was afraid that small thieves would sneak into the orchard at night to steal his tangerines. Therefore, during this "tangerine winter" period, after he had finished his dinner, he put down his rice bowl, casually wiped the corners of his mouth, and quickly ran to the orchard alone to guard it, braving the frost, dew, wind, and rain, bracing his spirits, walking alone in the middle of the night, shouldering a carrying pole, patrolling back and forth in the orchard. Especially when the year was coming to an end and the Lantern Festival was approaching, he defended so much that he even forgot about sleep.</p>
<p>In previous years, at this time, especially during the Lantern Festival, the price of tangerines was high, and he always had a large income to make up for the household expenses during the idle days after "tangerine winter".</p>
<p>"Why didn't I go to the early market? Cough, cough..." After clearing his throat, he took out his pipe from his waistband, filled it with tobacco, lit a match, and puffed, two wisps of blue smoke puffing out of his nostrils, and then continued: "The tangerine situation isn't good this year. Each load of tangerines has to donate more than one dollar in taxes. Naturally, 'what comes from the sheep, goes to the sheep,' so the price of tangerines has to be raised. But this year, many Taiwanese tangerines have come to the market. These look like devils! It is said that they don't need to pay taxes and can circulate everywhere. Although their tangerine juice is not as good as ours, the surface color and shape are much prettier than ours, and the price is cheaper. How can our tangerines not be hit by this! Anyway, people buy tangerines in the first month of the year just to give to relatives and friends, to add some festivity!... Alas! This year's tangerine situation, it's over!..."</p>
<p>The sunlight was blocked by a dark cloud, and a shadow appeared under the eaves, dim and gloomy.</p>
<p>"Papa, buy me a paper lantern, big and pretty; and a string of 'hundred sons' firecrackers!" The little girl grabbed her father's coat again, mumbling.</p>
<p>"You little devil, what are you making a fuss about!" Her mother angrily tapped her on the head.</p>
<p>Zhi Xingbo slowly stood up, walked behind the shrine, took out the paper lantern he had bought last year, and brushed off the dust with his felt hat, saying, "Xiao Nan, Daddy will make you a new one with colorful paper strips."</p>
<h3 id="e233">At Zhai Jun <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>It was already dusk when we arrived at Zhai Jun from Saigon.</p>
<p>Zhai Jun is a small town in Annam. Having become accustomed to the bustling street scenes of Saigon, the scenery of Zhai Jun seemed too simple and too shabby to us. A row of trees like mimosa swayed their long branches weakly, sending out a wave of the unique, wearying heat of the southern country. The two of us felt as if we had just climbed out of the water, our bodies soaked in sweat.</p>
<p>My companion was a businessman who had been away from Tangyou for eighteen years. He was a man who believed in fate, a thorough fatalist. Under the malicious manipulation of the god of fate, for more than a decade, he had been constantly overwhelmed by poverty and suffering. It is said that when the rubber plantations in Singapore were making profits, he had also made a small fortune, but he eventually lost it gambling. Because he believed in fate, he would go to the casino, whether it was one "dong," one "xian," or even just one "bo" (he had been to Siam and Singapore). Having him as a companion on the long journey in a foreign country really reduced my loneliness and trouble. We met at a wholesale bureau in Saigon.</p>
<p>Now he was taking off the wide-brimmed straw hat from his head, constantly fanning himself. Rows of sweat flew down from the edge of the hat, and the black silk edge of the straw hat was also soaked with cold sweat. In some places, it was dried by the hot sun, and curved white salt ash floated up.</p>
<p>"We need to rest. In this weather, it would be really lucky not to get 'black dog sha.' What do you say?" He said.</p>
<p>I nodded. There were few pedestrians on the street. Many women with bare upper bodies sat outside their houses enjoying the cool air, rows of sweat beads oozing from their dark backs like soybeans. A small merchant selling shaved ice squatted by the roadside with his tall basket, already fast asleep. When I walked past him, I saw that he was drenched all over, and a long stream of saliva trailed from the corner of his mouth. Those dark-faced, thick-lipped native children, pressing their hands on their bulging bellies, looked at us in surprise, tugging at their mothers' skirts, and speaking to us in a Chaozhou accent that was only 30% proficient:</p>

<p>"Continuously add explanations to the accompaniment" (the fewer explanations, the better). "Although the strong wind followed the vanguard of the flood, the lingering sound of the heavy rain still destroyed the hearts of the refugees. At this time, the great fields had completely become a swamp. Where would they go to survive? Fate was too playful. Let's see if they have the ability to resist! Several people were on a small boat like a leaf in the vast ocean, suffering from the cold wind and the pain of hunger! Fortunately, they were still young, otherwise, how could they not have died of hunger and cold? After enduring this for a few days, they discovered a glimmer of dawn in the future. Originally, it was a towering mountain peak, but now it has been half swallowed by water, and it looks like half a small hill. In the middle waist, there is a broken temple. So, they almost entrusted their entire hope to it. They approached the mountainside and climbed into the temple. Fortunately, there were still people here.</p>

<p>Opening "New Flower Moon Song"</p>
<p>The spring breeze of March brings the red of flowers. Hundreds of flowers dance in the shadow of the moon like a bow. I am, slowly walking among the flowers, smelling the moon, under the shadow, again passing the moon bridge and flower path. However, the moon turns to the eastern wall, and the flower shadows are chaotic. The flowers bloom in the northern garden, and the moonlight dissolves. The clouds break, and the moon peeps at the beauty of the flowers. Late at night, I sleep in the moon's brightness. Suddenly, I meet Chang'e in the moon, leaving the flower kingdom. Pomelo emerges from the flower garden, from the moon palace. I love her, the affectionate moon shines on the dew among the flowers. The understanding flowers sway in the wind under the moon. I love her, the spirit of the moon. The appearance of the flower. The moonlight and flower fragrance are the same. We are, returning the soul to the moon before the flowers with wine. Singing under the moon to face the flowers. Slowly beating the flower drum in the moon. Gently playing the moon shooting bow under the flowers. When the moon sets, I rely on the flowers to send wine. When the flowers wither, there is still the moon to urge makeup. I really hope that the moon will be round, and the flowers will be good, and they will never be scattered. Who knows, the moon will be missing, and the flowers will be withered, which is too sad. From then on, the endless hatred of spring flowers and autumn moon. The autumn moon and spring flowers' hatred are endless. The most unforgettable thing is that the bright moon and plum blossoms sleep with a fragrant moon, like cleanliness. The moon is like the spirit, and the flower is like the appearance. Until now, the fallen flowers have followed the moon waves. The remnant moon is still in the red of the flowers. Since ancient times, mirror flowers and water moon are generally all empty.</p>

<p>The autumn scene in August is fragrant with osmanthus. Amorous women laugh in their boudoirs. Only hear, the sound of cold insects outside the window is endless. The wind blows the purple bamboo rustling. The iron horse in front of the eaves rings. Lower my head. Thinking to myself. Thinking of my mother's handsome and talented man. I have not been married to my husband's family for half a month. The maid sends a letter into my room. Saying that my talented man is sick in bed. I am an incense table, a void worship. Pray to the heavens and the city gods. I only hope that he is safe and well. I have not been married to my husband's family for a month. It hurts me. I have cried several times and returned to life. My husband asks me why I am sad. I only say that the pain in my abdomen is the most difficult to bear. I should have come to the spirit to offer condolences. Only because I am not more than a month old as a new bride. It is inconvenient to offer condolences to the mourning hall. I have to secretly wear three points of mourning for you. I put a piece of linen on my chest. I don't wear red and green clothes. I wear two pieces of plain clothes. A pair of arched shoes on linen. I ask the maid to buy a piece of aloeswood. I carve my talented man's handsome and beautiful face. Wearing a haiqing, yellow belt. Red satin shoes with black satin trim. It is difficult for me to carve you. Pacing back and forth in the study. It is difficult for me to carve you. Opening your mouth to call me dear sister. It is difficult for me to carve you. Facing each other, playing chess, looking at the west wing hall. I have to harden my head and say goodbye to my talented man. When I get on the sedan chair, I cry sadly. Idle people only tell idle stories. Only saying that I can't drop my father and mother. How do they know, I can't drop the affectionate and righteous handsome and talented man. Talented man, I offer you during the day on the dressing table. At night, the blue gauze curtain is the lyric hall. There are so many sad things in the world. Other people's sadness is sad. My sadness is hidden in my belly.</p>

<p>At this time, the landlord Grigory Smirnov happened to come to Popova to calculate her husband's old debt of 1,200 rubles in order to pay the interest on the agricultural bank, but unfortunately, her accountant went to the city and would not come back until the day after tomorrow. She had no choice but to tell him to come and collect it the day after tomorrow, but he could not agree because he had to declare bankruptcy immediately if he did not pay the interest tomorrow. At that time, one had to have the money today, and the other could not pay you back until the day after tomorrow. The two could not retreat, and they quarreled. Finally, both sides were willing to use pistols to solve the matter through a duel.</p>
<p>But when he was really about to duel, her charming eyes and the dimples on her beautiful face took away his anger and courage, and he naturally softened. Instead, he knelt in front of her and begged her to marry him. Although she was determined to remain a widow for her husband! Finally, she said "Yes! Definitely!" Such contradictions!</p>
<p>At that time, her heart was being fought by the reason of "chastity" and the emotion of agreeing to his proposal! In the end, reason could not defeat emotion and was subdued!</p>
<p>When Luk called the coachman, gardener, etc. to rescue, he and she were hugging and sharing a long sweet kiss! Luk could only shout out "Oh God!"</p>
