<h3>美國總統競選之現階段</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>美國共和民主二大黨將於本年六月開全國代表大會推選本屆總統之候選人數日以來各州以選舉參加各黨代表大會之代表競爭頗烈不但二黨領袖各大放厥辭互相攻擊卽同黨之人以爭總統候選人之席亦互相詆毀美國之習慣凡値總選舉之年欲覓總統之位置者必先取得本黨代表大會中代表之擁護欲在代表大會中取得勝利於各州選舉代表之時卽須活動故日來羅斯福波拉之流僕僕風塵以取得人民之好感蓋初選之成敗與大　之成敗有絕對之關係也</p>
<p>就民主黨而論下屆之代表大會將推定羅斯福爲候選人已絕無問題蓋過去之習慣凡第一屆任滿之總統必爲第二屆競選之該黨候選人數十年來此習慣不變且民主黨之反羅斯福派爲數雖多自參議員惠朗被刺身死已無公認之領袖故惠朗之死羅斯福已可高枕無憂至於共和黨方面則無一致擁戴之領袖目前加入競爭者以參議員波拉千薩斯省省長蘭登及芝加哥新聞晚報社長諾克斯之呼聲爲最高鹿死誰手未可卜也</p>
<p>共和黨錦標之誰屬實本年美國大選中之至有興味問題蓋就目前呼聲最高之三人而論波拉之思想最進步不爲資本家所利用其攻擊新政純由小資產階級及農民階級之立塲出發氏之反對大托辣斯反對財閥富豪决不减於羅斯福然彼主張自由競爭個人主義及傳統之三權分立主義州權主義民權主義其思想雖較落後不失爲擁護平民利益之人蘭登爲政界中後進其在干薩斯省頗有政聲平衡預算减低租稅爲有產階級所喜其人謹愼保守有類前總統柯立芝柯立芝者美國工商界最歡迎之人物也至於諾克斯身爲商人其報紙以廣吿爲生命與財閥及工商界一鼻出氣更無疑義矣</p>

<h3>法國衆議院改選　第一次投票揭曉</h3>
<p>右派各黨稍估優勢二次投票左派可勝</p>
<p>（巴黎）此次衆議院改選、共計選舉區六百十八、共應選出衆議員六百十八名、截至本日上午五時十五分止、選舉結果已揭曉者、計有六百十一區、其中已獲選票過　數、確定當選者、共計一百七十九席、其餘四百三十二席、須俟下星期日（五月三日）舉行第二次投票始可决定當選與否、茲將當選人一百七十九名列表如下、</p>
<p>左派人民陣綫所屬各黨　六十二席</p>
<p>（甲）共產黨　十席　（乙）正統派社會黨　二十三席　（丙）共和社會卞義聯合黨　五席　（丁）獨立社會黨　三席　（戊）急進社會黨　二十一席</p>
<p>中央派各黨　五十席</p>
<p>（甲）獨立急進黨　十九席　（乙）左派共和黨　二十三席　（丙）人民民主黨　八席</p>
<p>右派國民陣綫所屬各黨　六十七席</p>
<p>（甲）共和民主聯盟黨　五十七席　（乙）獨立共和黨　十席</p>
<p>（巴黎）衆議院昨日舉行改選結果、因未獲過半數、而須舉行二次投票者、在六百十一席中、竟佔四百三十二席之多、此項數額、在歷屆選舉中、未之前見、除前總理赫禮歐及現任敎育部長蓋努以外、衆議院議長蒲伊松、（正統派社會黨）現任航空部長特阿（共和社會主義聯合黨）二人、亦未當選、按之往例、新衆議院之陣容、觀於第一次投票結果、已可覘其一斑、而本屆選舉第一此投票、則右派稍佔優勢、以故二此投票之形勢、當視左派人民陣綫所屬各黨能否完全履行所訂協定、以為斷也、（按照此項協定、該陣綫所屬各黨、互相的定、一俟第一次投票完畢、查明何黨得票最多、卽在二此投票時、選舉該黨候選人、以博最後勝利）又昨日選舉經過情形、允稱安寗、若干選區內選民、因純粹地方上理由、頗多棄權者、除此而外、全國選民、均踴躍參加投票、以故棄權率、當較之一九三二年為少、說者謂法國人民之擁護議會制度、忠守共和政體、於此可見一斑矣、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>本屆選舉特色　共產黨大勝利　較前增五十萬票</h3>
<p>（巴黎）昨日法國選舉之特色、為共產黨出人意外之勝利、此次共產黨所得票數、比一九三二年多五十萬票、大約可在新衆院得四十五席、而非如預料之三十席、其所獲者、大都為社會黨所失者、而社會黨則有奪取急進派議席之勢、共產黨在巴黎及北方工業區域尤覺勢力强固、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）此次衆議員改選、結果雖未完全揭曉、但在巴黎近郊與北部工業區域、共產黨顯有進步、此層最堪注意、查本屆衆議院中、（於一九三二年選出者）共產黨僅佔十席、據熟悉政情者觀察、選舉結果、該黨所佔議席、當可增至三十左右、至其他社會黨各派、（如正統派社會黨與共和社會主義聯合黨等、）約可得一百四十席左右、與本屆衆議院不相上下、至急進社會黨在本屆衆議院中、共有一百六十席、最佔優勢、頃據該黨資望最深之黨員預測、此此選舉結果、或將减少二十席左右、而僅剩一百四十五席左右、前後比較、雖較遜色、但在新衆議院中、仍可佔最多席數、以上合計左派人民陣綫在六百十八席中、可佔三百十五席左右、至於右派各黨在巴黎城內、地位雖甚鞏固、但該派與中央派各黨、議席數額未必有何重要增减云、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）一般人預料下星期日第二次投票之形勢、當於左派人民陣綫有利、而共產黨則因標榜愛國主義之故、尤當大獲勝利云、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）衆議院改選、本日舉行第一次投票、截至晚間十一時止、全城並未發生騷亂、入晚雨止、各報館門前與投票所前、市民　集、聽候消息、各報館或以傳聲筒報吿選舉結果、或以大字揭示門首、市民莫不先覩為快、至政界人物、則在各俱樂部或咖啡館內、高談闊論、均就第一次投票結果、以推測下屆衆議院之組織、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>法國史上創見　赫禮歐竟落選　謂將退出政界</h3>
<p>（巴黎）昨日從四千八百十四候選人中選出衆議員六百十八人之選舉、已寗靜過去、未發生意外事件、其最出人意表者、為赫禮歐在里昂選舉中竟未獲得絕對之多數、須於五月三日經第二次投票、現悉重要人物之已被選出者、有外長佛蘭亭及總理達拉第等、（二十七日路透）</p>
<p>（巴黎）當選議員中、有現任閣員六人、卽外交部長佛蘭亭、恩給部長裴斯、商務部長龐萊、郵電部長芒德爾、農業部長戴利埃、及勞工部長弗洛沙特是、又人民陣綫重要人物、如共產黨頒袖多萊士、正統派社會黨領袖奧利沃爾、急進社會黨黨魁前總理達拉第二人、及右派共和民主聯盟黨領袖前不管部閣員馬蘭亦均當選、至在第一次投票中、未得過半數選票、而須舉行第二次投票者、則估計有二百餘人之多、其中以急進社會黨前黨魁赫禮歐、與前財長萊諾二人、最為重要、赫禮歐以前總理之資望、而未在第一次投票中當選、此在法國選舉史上、實為創見、惟按照左派人民陣綫各黨、事前所成立之恊定、共產黨與社會黨、當在第二次投票中、選舉赫禮歐、故赫氏當選、終無問題、萊諾係以右傾中央黨選舉人資格、出而競選、其人在財政方面、極力主張法郞貶值、在外交方面、擁護法俄互助公約甚力、因此為右派各黨所反對、（哈瓦斯）</p>
<p>（巴黎）急進黨領袖赫禮歐得初選未獲絕對多數之報吿後、聞已聲明現擬退出政治、不再為第二次選舉之候選人、英法選舉制各異、英國以獲票最多者獲選、法國則以冠軍而獲絕對多數者、方為合格、否則須複選也、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）衆議院選舉第一次投票結果揭曉之後、證券市塲、業已發生惡劣反應、政府公債與法蘭西銀行股票開盤時卽見大跌、共他各銀行、與化學電氣各公司股票、亦一致跌落、法蘭西銀行股票約跌四百點、公債跌一點半、電氣總公司（法國最大之電氣公司）股票跌八十五點、克魯沙軍火廠股票跌八十七點、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>北路意軍萬人　自台西出發進迫阿京　輜重隊兵車絡繹於途兩星期後可達目的地</h3>
<p>（羅馬）據此間消息靈通者所稱、阿國北路意軍、現在台西城集中、本日卽當開始向南方進發、以冀早日攻陷阿國京城云、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>阿斯瑪拉　載重車運輸軍用品及糧食等物、由台西至阿京道上絡繹不絕、士兵及意軍亦開始出發、向阿京進攻之部隊、聞在萬人以上、軍事當局預計、在二星期後、意軍可以開抵阿京、意國部隊之前為工程隊、專修理道路、意軍進行之速、頗足驚人、星期日晚間、意軍已步行全路四分之一、（二十七日國民電）</p>
<p>阿斯瑪拉　台西意軍總部現正籌備進攻阿比西尼亞首都、第一集團國軍·土人軍·空軍·均各集於台西附近、在瑪加勒至台西之路、均見輸運汽車、絡驛於途、該路從前是由間狹道、現已擴大為汽車道、載重三千噸、載有各項軍器及糧食、經已開抵台西、待命前赴阿京前綫、台西以南之天氣、頗為良好、關於阿皇之下落、現乃無確實消息、（二十六日國民電）</p>
<p>台西　意軍今日凖備總攻哈拉爾齊齊加及阿京、南路意軍司令格蘭齊尼將軍部隊已於今日與那西蒲將軍最後防軍接衝、格氏自承認兩日來已死白種軍官十一人、受傷十七人、阿軍損失亦重、非正式消息宣稱、意軍業已佔領薩薩巴尼、（二十六日國民電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）據東菲意軍總司令巴杜格略上將來電、徵實達迦摩杜已下之說、謂南路意軍於四月二十三日突襲佔有該鎭、遇達加堡敵軍悍猛之反攻而擊退之、同日中央縱隊、內有海外投効之兵士、攻擊哈曼萊敵軍之陣地、全日接戰、二十五日黎明、意軍上槍刺逐走法芳河流域諸山洞中之敵兵、而佔領哈曼萊、同時右翼格那迦格戰壕守兵、為意軍所殲、該鈸亦遂陷落意軍乃乘勝北進、意軍損失連菲兵在內、死傷七百餘人、聞阿軍僅哈曼萊一處、死傷已逾千人、戰地築有三角形鞏固之防綫、接連達迦摩杜·薩薩巴納·與達迦堡三鎭、而阻塞通哈拉爾之大道、蓋意軍此次進攻、以哈拉爾為目的物也、該境多嶮岨不毛之山岩、並多深密之灌木、而急流從山間瀉下、以達諸山谷、多汜濫者、阿軍司令那錫波將軍藉土耳其韋希白將軍之助所築成之戰壕綫、廣佈機關槍窟、圖阻格拉齊亞尼將軍之前進、但意飛機所擲之炸彈、準而猛烈、迫令敵軍退出所據之諸山洞、那錫波將軍於是乃以阿國陣式密集進攻、卒為意軍所敗、意軍機械化之隊伍已向達迦堡方面逐北、意軍由摩迦狄斯西沃為起點之交通綫、長約五百哩、故須修築道路與鐵路、水上且須建造橋梁、據當局宣稱、薩薩巴納陷落之消息、如果確實、則意軍可控制交通全綫、而啟通哈拉爾之進路矣（廿七日路透電）</p>
<p>阿京　今晨意機飛過阿京、擲落傳單、內稱、如不投降、定將屠盡居民、毁其房屋、降則阿人受益、因意人將以商業繁榮與文明輸入阿國也云、此項傳單係用阿比西尼亞文字印成、由東菲意軍總司令巴杜格略將軍署名、並稱、意軍已佔據阿國北部全境與沃加登地方、不久將以上帝之扶助而入阿京云（二十七日路透電）</p>
<p>阿京　今日此間有意國三發動機飛機一架、盤旋空際、擲下阿文傳單、略謂意軍在南北兩路、皆已大捷、汝等不必再行毁壞道路、從事抵抗、否則我人必將殲滅汝等也、（二十七日國民電）</p>
<p>阿京　阿皇之女卓海公主、芳齡僅十七、頃向外國各報記者、發表談話、請其代向「全世界婦女」請命、略謂、「意國軍隊在我國境內、橫行不法、並使用毒瓦斯、全世界人士、若竟熟視無睹、則整個文明卽將毁滅、所望君等仗義執言、再三要求貴國有力人士、出以有效的行動、愈速愈妙、君等如能加以督促、則貴國政府必能令行駐意大使、對於意軍暴行、一致表示厭惡之意、並轉請國聯會强迫意國、將其在東菲洲所屯積之瓦斯、悉數銷燬、卽十八國小組委員會（擔任討論制裁問題）亦必受命而立卽禁止軍械運往意國、並封鎖航路、藉以阻止該國軍隊、開至東菲洲」云、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>國聯改組聲　改組理論不一小國極為注意</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯旣未能阻止意阿戰爭、現遂發生改組國聯之問題、許多人以德國不願祖任對於侵略國參加制裁之義務、主張廢除盟的中關於制裁之第十六條、同時又有人主張務使盟約第十六條愈為有力、庶侵略國不復能與施行制裁國家維持友好關係、如意國所為、並有人主張成立地方協定、而規定義務包括在內、以補助一般協定、為國聯之後援、聞較小國家現以甚大之注意視察時局、彼等雖承認國聯在阿比西尼亞之失敗、但恐任何新改組適增弱國之危險耳、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<h3>英前外相　霍爾將任海相　鮑爾溫請霍爾回國</h3>
<p>（倫敦）晨郵報曾載稱、海軍大臣孟塞爾卽當掛冠而去、遺缺當由前外相霍爾爵士繼任云、此在保守黨人士、則稱此層未免言之過早、緣孟塞爾雖不長此担任海相一職、但不脫離政治生活、至霍爾繼任海相一舉、他日容有可能、此際英國輿論、對於此君、仍多不滿入閣之議、一時尙難成為事實云、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）此說雖未經當局徵實、然孟氏切欲吿退、首相鮑爾溫願霍爾回閣之訊業經承認矣、（二十七日路透電）</p>

<h3>化學科講演之一　中等學校化學的敎學（上）　國立編譯館專任編譯陳可忠</h3>
<p>目前中國科學敎育已逐漸推上了繁興之路，這不能不算是　件值得欣幸的事情，譬如近年各種科學專門人才一天一天的增多，科學研究機關及各大學理工農醫等學院的種種進步，是其明例。不過這種科學敎育進展的潮流似乎只能影響到少數在大都會的學術和敎育機關，而對於一般中等學校，仍舊是無由挿入，以致中學生對於理科的程度，進步得　常緩慢。我們知道，中學生是國家的命脈，而中等敎育是一切敎育的咽喉。中等敎育如果失敗，下而影響到初等敎育，上而影響到高等敎育，換言之，就是一切敎育的實施，都用不着談了。敎育當局對於這層，當然認得很淸楚，所以數年來對於中等敎育銳意整頓，而對於理科敎育的改進，尤其努力。最近中小學課程標　和中學理科設備標準的公布，也可算是敎育當局改進中等敎育的先聲。但是課程標準公布以後三四年來，中等理科敎育似乎仍然沒有很顯明的進步。別的姑且不談，單就化學來講罷。案照敎育部的課程標準，初中二年級的化學功課，第一學期每週講習四小時，第二學期三小時；高中的化學也是在二年級習學，每週講習四小時，實騐第一學期三小時，第二學期二小時。這樣看米一個中　的畢業生，在化學方面，有了兩年化學的講習和一年的實騐。中學生對於化學程度，有這樣的準備，在世界各國頂多也不過如此，但是據各大學住持化學人員的報吿，歷年投考大學的學生，化學的程度，並不使人滿意。表面上看來，中學化學準備已算很充分，但結果仍舊使人失望。我們細細考察這一原因，大致不外下列　種：</p>
<p>敎科書編輯不完善　拿我們歷　所審查的化學敎科書看，大部分都免不掉這幾種毛病：　一般化學敎科書的內容，總嫌太多。初中的化學敎科書，幾乎把高中要講的材料，統統編進去，而高中的敎科書又常常把大學的敎材勉强塞入。本來一本書有很群細的內容，很豐富的材料，並不算一件壞事，但是這些敎科書是為中學生用的，我們對於取材的輕重和程度的深淺，該　分注意，否則，這種的敎科書就不適宜於初學的學生了。　有的編書人，缺乏中學敎書的經騐，結果所編的材料，多半不是太深就是太淺。　有的編書人，對於近年化學的發展，不十分明瞭；因為化學是一種日　月異的科學，編書人如果不參考新的村料，所編的書籍就不免落伍，　在所說的，大都是十年以前的老調，譬如　到元素發現的數目，有的敎科書說是八十六種，有的說是九十種，這種很大的差別，明明表示他們對於近年來化學的進展十分隔膜，此外還有少數編書的人對於化學的智識，根本就很淺薄，道類編書的人，大都不是專門學化學的，他們隨便找幾本化學書籍來抄抄，他們自身對於化學的學理和事實，就弄不淸楚，這樣編出來的敎科書，其內容當然不堪過問。</p>
<p>學校設備不充分　我們知道除了敎育比較發達，敎育經費比較充分的幾省外，中等學校的理科設備是非常簡陋的，有的省分，中學化學設備，不特不能供給學生實騐，連敎員的示敎實騐亦不能做。化學本來是一種實騐的科學，離開了實騐和實地的觀察，要使中學生對於化學心領神會發生興趣，是辦不到的。所以敎員儘管在講台上口講指劃，但學生聽起總是茫然，眞是所「謂言者諄諄聽者藐藐」了。</p>
<p>敎員缺乏硏究和進取的精神　中學生化學的程度不能提高，敎員要負很大的責任。因為假使敎科書有不妥當的地方，優良的敎員可以就學生的程度，自由取捨，以補救敎本的缺點，學校設備簡陋，敎員也可以設法補救，有很多淺近的化學實騐，敎員很可以自己製造簡單的儀器來應用的，就是有錢的學校，敎員如果能自己設法製造簡單的儀器，那末所節省的錢可以用買較貴重的儀器。反過來說，有的學校設備經費很充分，但是敎員如果沒有硏究和進取的精神，那末他對於設備的購置和準備，往往漫不經心，就很容易流於浪費了。關於道浪費的情形，在中學方面，究竟做到甚麽地步，本人現在還沒有精確的數據，若就大學而論，這種浪費情形是很可怕的。記得本人前次視察某大學時，有一位理學　的主要人員，用很得意的神氣，指示一種很貴重的光學儀器給我們看，但是經過我們細細的檢查後，發現這種儀器短少了一項機件，結果這個很貴重的儀器是中看不中用的。其他大學中，也不免有此類浪費的毛病。這樣看來，應當省的錢不能省，而眞正需要的東西，却無錢購置，我想在中學方面，這種情形恐怕也免不了吧。此外敎員還有一個普遍的缺點，就是也犯了同編書人一樣的毛病，沒機會去參考新的材料，光敎死書，今天講的材料同去年一樣，去年講的同前年一樣，年年如此，這樣，怎麼能够引起學生的興趣呢？</p>
<p>學制和標準的變動　以往我國的學制和標準常有變動，學校當局旣難擬一固定計劃，敎員敎學也無定軌可循。敎科書的編輯亦受牽動，譬如以前課程的决序是先敎物理後敎化學，現在是先敎化學後敎物理，這樣一來，物理同化學敎科書的內容，尤其是有一部分物理與化學關係最密切的材料，編輯的程序就不得不加以變動。這種標準的變動，在外國是很少，所以他們的敎科書，在再版或修正的時候，都是只將新的材料挿進去，而對於編制和體裁方面，並不十分改動，結果是愈編愈好。中國的敎科書，則因學制和標準的變動，所以敎科書的改動，往往不是增加新材料，而是在迎合新學制和新標準，因此敎科書編來編去，仍是沒有多大的進步。這是就大體而說的，至於有許多敎科書已經出到了三版四版，甚至已出到了十版八版，（這當然是指未經敎育部審定或已失效的書籍而言）而其內容仍是和初版完全一樣，道種不長進的情形，當然不能歸咎於標準的變動。</p>
<p>最近敎育當局亦明瞭以上的毛病，所以對於這些缺點，已經擬就了幾種補救的方法；現在就我個人所知道的說一說：</p>

<h3>陳謨醫生被控　吳徵蘭之子死後　訴醫生過失致死</h3>
<p>小兒專科醫生廣東人陳謨、年五十八歲、家住甘司東路二二一號至三號附設兒科療養院、並在霞飛路維而蒙路口一四一號及北四川路九七七號兩處分設診所、營業頗為發達、近被住法租界寗波路第二十八號門牌汪企張醫院內之看護錢吳徵蘭、齊沛人、年二十八歲、征律師具狀第二特院刑事</p>
<p>自訴陳謨</p>
<p>過失致人於死、法院准狀、於昨日下午三時、由李昌年推事蒞第二刑庭、先據自訴人稱、婦人之子名道生、今年三歲零二月、向來寄養於貝勒路恒淵里朋友張王氏家、於上月十七日、忽發寒熱、先請汪企張開方熬藥、於二十一日下午寒熱忽又增加、適因汪醫生</p>
<p>有事赴杭</p>
<p>故於下午一點三刻時、婦人與張王氏將孩抱至霞飛路陳醫生之診所看病、乃陳醫生於三點一刻始到診所、隨即看病、當據陳醫生說、此是腥紅熱病、須要打血淸針、言曰、即將血淸針一瓶打入肌肉內、約二分鐘、只見小孩二手發抖、口吐白沫、婦人見狀</p>
<p>駭極痛哭</p>
<p>陳醫生尙說不妨事、又打强心針三次、詎已無法挽救、移時身死於診所、但當時雖有多人看見、婦人於昏迷之間、未曾詢問姓名、故此無法邀案作證、然我孩生前非常活潑、在家時又能拍球游戲、霎時間被吿誤指腥紅熱針刺血清劑身死、實有</p>
<p>過失致死</p>
<p>婦人丈夫出門三年未回、祇養此子、請求依法訊辦外、附追撫養喪葬費三千元、慰恤費五千元等語、結之陳謨供、自訴人之小孩在我診所因醫治無效而身死、實有其事、但事實　有不符、是日我於二時許、由甘司東路到霞飛路診所、僅見自訴人之小孩病狀</p>
<p>甚為厲害</p>
<p>係腥紅熱症、當時我囑其速送（格里）醫院、她說救救、我說難救、她又說無論如何要救的、我見他一再懇求、故用血淸針、但此腥紅熱病症、必須要打此血淸針、當時祇打半甁、後我到甘司東路去看其他小孩之病、及至回至霞飛路診所時、自訴人又將小孩抱來叫我救救　故我</p>
<p>又打半甁</p>
<p>官問究竟什麼病、答、的確腥紅熱病狀、口發靑、兩眼向上、遍體發紅點、當時吾一再叫自訴人送醫院、自訴人一再叫我救救　實非醫生之過失云、自訴人又稱、被吿之言不確、當時被吿並未叫我送醫院、未打針前、他頗有把握、他說明天再來復診、不　打後</p>
<p>突然變態</p>
<p>代理律師起而聲稱、査工部局定章、凡腥紅熱病症須送工部局醫院診治、其他醫　、概不可醫治、對此一點、有調査之必要、此案起訴之前、被吿曾託某醫生向自訴人和解、自訴人不允筆語、官向被吿問曰、有無其他小孩死在爾診所否、答、除腥紅熱病外、常常有的、李推事諭改期再核、</p>

<h3>粵桂實業考察報吿（十）</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>粵桂兩省實業之鳥瞰</p>
<p>廣東工業之建設，為其三年計畫中最主要之部分，總計各廠所費在四千萬元左右，魄力之偉大可知，其士敏土廠之營業額，年約二千萬元，省內任何建築，均須採用省營士敏土廠之出品，故其獲利可操左劵，去年有六百三十萬元之贏餘。此外如硫酸，如苛性鈉，如淡氣，如肥田粉，如蔗糖，如造紙，如飲料，均先後成立，而以省營產物經理處總其成。糖之產額，尙不逮銷額之巨，如何挹注，頗費研究。紡織廠之規模，尤為偉大，有棉紡織，毛紡織，絲紡織，蔴及絹絲紡織，可謂包羅萬象，應有盡有，惟廣東不生棉花，又無羊毛，棉紡毛紡，均苦原料之無從挹取，以華北上海之棉紡工業正嫌過剩，復有此　牀架屋之建設，似於整個工業之計畫上不無研究。觀其營業計畫，毛紡年可得五十五萬元之純益，棉紡年可得二十一萬餘元之純益，恐屬理想，事實上不易如願。絹絲蔴紗，大可擴展，此後蔴袋廠成立以後，植蔴事業，大有可為，農林局馮局長曾注意於此，總之粤省工業，仍建立於農業之上，非農業多生產，不能促進工業，非工業大發展，不能謀農業之出路。聞粤省第二期之三年計畫，除注意重工業外，將於農業上有大量的擴展也。最近粤省農業，經馮梯霞局長之銳意經營，頗有成效，目下最巨之工作，一為改良稻種，廣東一年輸入洋米一千九百萬担，總非辦法，故非努力增加米榖產量，使之自給不可，現已試騐各種稻種，比普通米可以增加百分之四十以上。一為優良蔗種，現試騐之蔗種。有二十餘種，比本地種可增產量兩三倍，糖量一倍以上。此外如防除牛瘟，改良果樹，整理水利，促進林墾，防除害蟲，試騐優良菸葉，改進水產事業，改良農具，試騐優良棉種，改良豬種雞種鴨種，均有具體計畫，按步進行。</p>
<p>廣西人民，業農者佔百分之八十，工業仍滯於手工業時代，工作簡單，僅供本省使用，近以國內外工業品輸入激增，製法旣精，售價又廉，致使本省僅有之手工業，亦不能與之抗衡，有日受淘汰之勢。桂省當局，為力求自給及挽救工業落後起見，故雖屬經濟凋敝萬分，亦已設有硫酸，桐油，酒精，製革，製糖，機械，印刷各廠，略具現代工業之規模。惟硫酸酒精兩廠，於原料及市塲問題，無適當之解决，前途慘淡，至為可慮，蓋硫酸原料，旣須仰給外省，粤省兵工廠，又非其顧主，出路旣空，何從立足。惟貴縣糖廠，頗有希望，梧州桐油廠，亦日見發達。南寗之製革印刷兩廠，均往參觀，在幼稚工業中，已屬不可多得，而桂省上下廉潔苦幹之精神，尤屬可敬可效。農業方面，於造林水利兩端，均有積極設施。柳州之農事試騐塲，從事林墾與農作事業，頗有成績，又設農林示範塲於八個民國區幹部學校所在地，逐漸以總塲試騐結果，如選種，栽培，施肥，加工，飼養等技術，由示範塲傳授於民團幹部學生，此等學生，離校回鄕，任鄕村長兼國民基礎學校校長，卽傳授於農民，推廣便捷，容易普遍，近來生產日增。牲畜，米榖，桐油為出口之大宗，果能善於推廣，增加生產，輸出額當日巨一日。桂省棉花最為缺乏，每年棉布棉紗為入口貨之大宗，現在已設棉作試騐塲，以期設法恢復固有之棉產。礦產五金頗富，煤雖有而不豐，已開之礦，如富川，賀縣，鐘山，河池，南丹之錫，恭城，富，賀，鐘之鎢，貴縣，河池之　，右江，武鳴，上林，濛江之金，出產量數，年有增加。故桂省雖號稱窮省，然地下之礦與地面之農作物，均屬致富之源，茍能一方綱羅技術人才，一方利用外省資本，以事開發，則數年之後，窮瘠之區，何難變為富裕之省也。（已完）</p>

<h3>談談非常時期的敎育</h3>
<p>— 邵鳴九</p>
<p>我也　談談這個非常時期的敎育的問題、事前我和現在負敎育行政領導之責者、互相交換意見過、也經過自已再三考慮過、都覺得這個問題、重在事實、不在理論、更無需得唱高調、對於這個問題、明白的說一句、就是要切實容易、可是想達到這句話的辦法，據我看來、祇有使全國不識字的民衆、一致實　民衆識字、換句話說、也就是識字敎育、你瞧現在中央政府不是鼓勵各地方提倡義務敎育、辦些識字學校、結果成功少、而損失多、這個緣故、很是容易明白的、在一般敎育領袖的思想、總是注意通都大邑、從沒有想到深入鄉村裏去、但是極熱鬧的大都市裏、平被頂注意的是新奇的事情，才容易迎合社會人士的心理、並且很容易使一般唯利是圖的人們、竭力投資、以從事漁利、他們也從沒有想到什麼識字敎育、是如何有和於民衆、是地方安甯的根本問題、我說到這一句話的時候、不得不　大都市聲明一句、因爲大都市普通的習慣、多數的民衆、總離不了勞工的生活、在一日裏、所謂最低限度是八小時的工作、多則十幾小時以上、也不一定、條這些勞工的民衆、在生活十分勞苦情况之下、若要强迫他識字、這種辦法、也是不容易收效的、</p>
<p>現在我所要提的、固然逃不以這句老文章、就是趕緊把識字的工作、加重些、實行起來、這句話在表面看來、好像是一帖甘草清淡的藥味、很普通、極平常、但是要吃的人、可以保險有益無損、我再把識字的內容、添上一句、也就是普遍的識字敎育、更明白的說、就是目前敎育所謂「非常時期的敎育、」我之所以不敢妄談何種敎育、是最適合我國現在情勢而需要之敎育、我想國難當頭之急務、還是要從敎育入手、　敎育的方式、恐怕也不能離開這切實的識字敎育罷、我可具體點說、此刻最高敎育當局、早覺悟如何把初等敎育的課程、取聯貫性、而注重普遍民族化、在中等敎育這一階段裹、也提到把課程如何縮緊、使授課時間集中、訓練有具體思想、有感化而兼創造思想的、至於高等敎育的趨勢、也是大同小異、他的辦法、是很對的、可是現在我國的敎育方針、不在治標、而重在治本、國勢旣如是緊急到萬分危險的程度、敎育的目標、常然不能像從前德國式、日本式·美國式·法國式的、還有今日推行道爾頓制、明日改用設計敎學法的、其中有許多新名稱、說不勝說、總之、戲法變來變去、還是這一套、也不管中國式好、外國式好、總要顧到國土民情風俗習慣上去才對、否則大家來討論這個非常時期的敎育、不知從那裏下手、據我個人的意見、與其徒唱空調、不如來幹切切實實簡單而易舉的識字敎育罷、</p>
<p>（附註）對於識字敎育其體的辦法、當然不在本文討論範圍之內、如時間許可、自應另擬辦法、責獻於敎育當局、</p>

<p>咋華商證券交易所、六月份期貨、開始登塲、交易頗稱熱鬧、丁丙兩種、定於六月初旬抽簽、故六月份期貨、均已除中　、市况因連日激漲之後、遽起反動、多頭紛紛出籠、跌風甚厲、甲種下降、遽接連衝進三個最高紀錄、進銳退縮、勢所必至、蓋以連日、川帮買進、一般投機家、風起雲湧、浮多頓見擁擠、壁壘稍一搖動、即有崩潰之虞、檀面情形、當有一部份多頭、作困獸之鬥、故前途危機尙多、未可樂觀也、昨日經過、開盤初因八號買進五月份戊種、開價即發見六十四元之新紀綠、旋以十號及三十五號賽出、遽轉下風、趨勢一變、人氣驟餒、多方爭先出籠、故後列反小二角至四角不等、次盤賣風未戢、十號三十五及四十七號均有拋出及出籠、散戶多頭亦求出脫、市價再小三四角、午後形勢尤劣、跌風更厲、丁種狂跌八角半、餘亦小二角至六角、三十七號出籠未已、收盤雖有丙種之微堅、僅爲臨時空頭之抵補關係、餘則仍小一角至三角、狂漲之後、引起反動、前途似尙有變化、市價結果、除六月份初開出不計外、五月份一致回跌七角至一元三角不等、成交總數、共計八百三十八萬五千元、茲將其漲跌結果、比較列表於後、（單位元成交單位百元）、又今日爲四月低期貨交割之期、停市一天、</p>
<h3>紗花　存紗增多現需淸　標紗花空頭活動甚力</h3>
<p>紗市續挫、跌風益熾、蓋邇來紗銷岑寂、客方皆無進胃、同時倉庫中存紗繼長增高、於是空方活動殊力、但銀行界暨金業帮之多額、尙未出籠、</p>
<p>標紗各月一致下降</p>
<p>標紗前午開盤、各月一致下降、目賣風濃烈、因多方連日吸收胃量、巳有飽滿之狀、空方鑒於對方意態闌珊、拋賣興趣、突然濃厚、於是塲中籌碼鬆懈、市價乃愈形不支、合興大豐賣出加碼、仁豐補空亦旺、標紗結果各月比上日收盤價均跌九角至一元二·三·五角、午後開盤、局勢仍屬平庸、且賣方聲勢汹湧、拍至二三盤時、有一部分獲利者抵補略回、結果各月比上午收盤價近跌一、二角、還漲一角、查賣出大孚五百包、吉豐六百五十包、大豐一千一百包、合興千八百包、森康七百五十包、恒德五百五十包、元一六百五十包　生源一千二百包、永大七百包、信誠一千七百包、達計一千九百包、買進聚興一千四百包、昶記五百包、興昌五百五十包、仁豐二千四百五十包、泰昌八百五十包、潤康一千〇五十包、經華七百五十色、振大一千三百包、愼記九百包、新華一千一百五十包、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>
<p>現紗亦跌一元左右</p>
<p>現紗銷路平淡、查全日各帮買去統計五百五十五包、售價跌五角至一元、各帮買額如下、</p>
<p>棉市大疲、跌風頗盛、蓋以多方拉緊甚久、邇來紗銷淸疲、原棉需求甚滯、於是空方紛紛活動、拋賣亦鉅，壓力甚重，但通記之多頭仍未出檔、且猶在竭力掙扎中、</p>
<p>標花供　五元關口</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、各月一律低落、賣氣嚴重因多方在六月期轉賬後、空方認爲對方收貨力量未見强大、於是賣意大濃特濃、七·八兩個月俱敲破五元關口、但通記之多頭安然不動、結果各月比上日收盤價均跌三角半至四角、午後開盤氣勢仍然不振、且賣方頻施壓力、多方奄無生氣、堅守不動、二三盤稍見回上、收盤又軟、結果各月比上午收盤價近勿動、遠跌一角、查賣出錦昌二千五百擔、合興七各五百擔、森康二千七百擔、慎記二千擔、協成一千五百擔、大昶一千八百擔、永昌一千四百擔、益康四千三百擔、源興昌二千擔、買逃通記一千六百擔、大孚一千五百擔、聚興四千六百擔、振大二千六百擔、泰興三千七百擔、益昶二千二百擔、潤康二千二百擔、同和二千一百擔、一日間最高做價及收盤價列下、</p>
<p>現棉廠需仍屬不爽</p>
<p>現棉消費仍滯、廠胃不爽、來源姚花三百九十包、通花八十包、</p>
<h3>紗布倉庫存紗增高</h3>
<p>華商紗布交易所倉庫中棉紗存底、截至本月二十五日止、統計　萬一千一百八十包、比上次之二萬九千包、增加二千一百八十包、其中以二十支紅魁星四千三百五十包、及天官三千三百六十包、兩牌爲獨多、其次爲大飛艇·金城·汽球·金雞·等紗、約二·三千包之譜、茲將內容列下、（單位包）</p>
<p>美棉現貨需求淸淡</p>
<p>昨美棉開盤、各月漲跌一二磅音、近月因同業買進及補空而堅、遠月平疲、西南方面天氣不定、阿根塞斯及奧克拉霍姆有陣雨可能、其後七月期有套賣、業外買戶缺乏、同業觀望、現需靜寂、借欵棉花在甫方走動益增、收盤平疲、計現貨漲三磅音、期貨漲三磅昔至跌六磅音、英棉現貨跌二點、期貨漲跌一二點、印棉交易稀少、塲中缺乏興奮消息、收盤堅穩、計平果爾跌〇·五〇至一·二五羅比、奧姆辣漲〇·二五羅比、白羅溪跌〇·二五至〇·五〇羅比、原電錄左、（二十五日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、二十七日七八月期白羅溪花之開盤預測、爲二百零二羅比、較上日收盤跌一·二五羅比、</p>
<p>三品紗漲花平</p>
<p>二十七日大阪電、三品期紗漲八角至一元五角、近月爲一百九十八元、遠月爲一百九十八元一角、期棉漲跌一角至三角、近月爲六十四元九角五分、遠月爲六十一元六角五分、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布銷塲供過於求　皖贛尙有去路餘皆零星</h3>
<p>棉布因各路需要益呆、供過於求、價格難以堅持、昨受紗花跌價影響、一致疲落、細布·市布·每疋跌一角左右、八磅四原布、本可漂白加膠粉做成洋紗、以應夏令之需、向甚堅俏、今亦以洋紗銷路淸淡、不敢添製、每疋立跌七分半、細斜賴貨底單薄、市價勉能維持、惟後步甚軟、如陽鶴細斜、現貨與派司貨之價格、相差達每疋一角、以前不過五分、各客路進胃淡薄、僅南昌帮續進本廠各牌細布細斜漂布府綢花布等貨二百件、安徽帮進大生廠申新廠細布及雜牌細斜府綢嘩嘰等貨百餘件、此外都屬小數交易云、</p>
<h3>糧食　廠商觀望粉市平寂</h3>
<p>咋日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份大致呈平寂之態、以洋麥報價芝加哥跌二三角不等、坎拿大跌一角零、市塲人心、對於本月份已將過去、廠方維持市價、稍出壓平、至於遠期、目下雖各廠多數觀望、無大量出檔、惟近來天時殊見順利、麥苗透發頗速、因此人心遂稍和平、回落近分、迨至下午開盤、交易不暢、價亦上落甚微、觀察趨勢、終須新麥有一部分之把握、雙方之爭競、方能開始云、</p>
<h3>期麥買刻稍增　—盤價回好一二分—</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤、各月份出入無幾、六月份開價尙佳、提至六角、後則回落三分、其餘月份、祇有一二分之出入、迨至下午開盤、因天時又呈陰寒、買戶稍暢、各月份提好一二分、照目下情形、全趨互擯、以雙方均靜待新麥之年收如何、方有上落可言、現麥市面、仍無變動、開出東瑤灣宿遷南宿州麥五元三角、由福新辦去千餘包云、</p>
<p>美國小麥、仍受天時影響、旱區有零星陣雨、買進致未奮勇、</p>
<h3>囤戶於脫售　客秈續見疲軟</h3>
<p>昨日客利市　、依盤平疲無神、而囤戶亦以天　　　、存米不能久擱、一部份行囤已有不能堅持之意、目九江米源源而來、溫台米以米質較軟、尤多亟於運申求售、昨市且有少數貶價求脫者、故各米市價續見平落三五分至近角不等、去路仍抵本街一路、客囤仍觀望不動、而洋碎米請求免加全稅一事、甬商請求者巳荷允准、滬商在請求中、大約當援例照准、故後步市况暫乏佳狀云、</p>
<h3>河下米市依舊呆滯　中關薄稻跌去二角餘</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源、共到二十餘號、貨共四十餘石、薄稻居多、故該貨市况、天津靑島烟台等帮雖有動辦二千四五百包、而結果高料行情仍削角外、中關宿貨且跌二角餘、至於厚早粳、到貨雖稀、然連朝沛積頗豐、復以本街銷路尤滯、因而疲弱、再降角許、杜洋尖跟　五分至一角、陰變元平疲、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源念六七號、市上各貨去胃仍屬淸淡、白粳和平、惟久擱之貨因欲求急脫致價疲小數分、陰元貨少、價形挺秀、白元零化仍滯、價又小七八分、薄稻鮮艷之貨、價形挺立、中下者價形疲軟、各尖略帶軟勢、其餘各貨均形和平、</p>
<h3>油市　荳油漲勢頗強</h3>
<p>豆油及花生油之漲風頗盛、比上週末市漲起三五角不等、出於大連劇變、產價步漲、各路銷場繁榮、預測趨勢尙屬堅硬、故一般行販心思一致看好、故其市面有榮無辱之概、統市計開各種豆油一千三百貨、花生油八百五十件、</p>
<h3>糖市　本綿白降去一角</h3>
<p>昨糖市以銷路仍呆、市勢依然下游、公會划盤二四粗砂白現貨叫二十二元、轉口貨六元八角半、比小五分、東赤無更動、東白現貨四號二十一元八角、八號二十一元四角半、均小五分、九號一十一元三角、轉口貨四八九號均無上落、本廠綿白各小一角、振記一號二十元五角、二三四五號亦小五角、大華金心一號均二十元七角、以上各小二角、號貨均乏開出、</p>
<p>四千〇五十九包、五羊粗白東莞順德兩廠出品二十一元八角、曲溪廠出品二十一元六角、二號粵綿白二十一元五分、四號又二十八元角半、中砂白二十元五角半、結果統共成交九百二十一包、比上屆稍增、價無上落、</p>
<h3>南北貨　龍口粉略見回好</h3>
<p>龍口　粉干、近以產價回好數角、市勢轉穩、此間客貨開過二十三元半、行盤北規叫二十四元、南規（九二皮）售二十三元、查產電報過三十一元八角後、（每包計）尙無續報、惟申市以去胃未旺、不易過好、</p>
<h3>絲茶　遂安綠茶大宗上市</h3>
<p>浙省遂安綠茶、由來巳有大宗新貨上市、前因茶棧停兌、市面頓趨呆滯、現聞土莊製茶廠家、已有十餘家携帶現欵趕到搜辦、市面復趨活潑、茶價又復提升至六十八元、</p>
<h3>蕭山新茶頭批到八包</h3>
<p>本市華茶公司製茶廠、昨日巳由浙省蕭山辦到新茶八包、聞諸暨貨日內亦有到滬云、</p>
<h3>河口紅茶先後採摘</h3>
<p>贛省鉛山縣屬之河上紅茶、自二十一日後、黃源葛源等處產茶區域、多有先後採摘、且因天時晴朗、葉底極佳、製茶號家、均已從事收辦新貨、以便興工趕製云、</p>
<h3>雜訉　普通良薑號盤步跌</h3>
<p>良薑前以到存不多、頂上大只會到十五六元、近來中小貨到數漸增、而去胃反呆、兼之廣帮時有賤兌、致價步降、前後已跌去一二元、中小貨尙無穩象、惟大良薑因貨底較缺、尙屬平定、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （肖白）</p>
<p>「自大」是要失敗的，但是我們不可不「自價」，</p>
<p>自信心是比金錢勢力，家世，親友更有助的東西，它是人生最可靠的資本，它能使你克服困難，排除障礙，望着你成功的道上，一步步地走近去，</p>
<p>在這世界上，有許多人，往往就自卑自抑，十分地抹殺自己，他們以爲別入所有的幸福，是永遠不能屬於他們的，他們是陷在命運論的泥沼裹，而不知道積極地自　，和努力做去，他們是可以達到目的，可以操到勝算的。</p>
<p>據說哥侖布的發現新大陸，拿破侖的縱橫歐洲，百戰百勝，他倆不但單純是有着勇氣，並且都是靠了這自信力，纔有他們偉大的成就。</p>
<p>所以，成功的先决條件，就是堅强　「自信」。</p>
<h3>惰性的表現</h3>
<p>— 臥佛</p>
<p>我國人的最普遍的惰性，因爲隨時隨地在不自覺的表現着，所以稍加留意的話，也隨時隨地可以見到。這裏，目把我們常常在感觸到的最明顯的兩種寫在下面。</p>
<p>各地舟車上的情形可以不說，單把我們日常乘坐的電車而言：就已充份表顯着偷懶畏難的共有的根性。電車方停下來時，在下面候着的人都不等車上的乘客下車，就各爭先恐後，個個想排開眾人讓我第一個衝上車廂去，這可以說是奮勇嗎？不！無非怕多站一回，怕搶不到座位罷了，且有他們對於佔取座位的目的，十個中又有九個是着眼那四個座頭的角落，所以就是乘客稀少的時候，這四個角落，也不會空着的，他們都要佔據這角落的原意，爲的是角落可以有個倚靠，可把身體交托個着實，這樣，便要比較省力而舒適的多。所以佔據這四四個角落的人，都是兩足舒伸，兩手平展，頭和背部，斜形的仰後枕着貼着，這不但是懶惰，簡直完全顯露出他「依賴」的根性了。</p>
<p>這種情形，據說在外國是很少見的，但在我們中國，則可說是司空見慣，尤其是衣冠並不楚楚的我們，走進任何一家商家，都得使你頒略個飽。譬如你選購物品時，因爲不能滿意，有勞那位職員多取幾種，一二次給你掉取，還不怎樣，二次以後，煩厭的神色，就會浮露到他的面上，使你見了來個寒心，同時，向你發表的談話，耳朶也漸漸地覺到刺痛了，結果，無論如何不中意，因爲怕他加你幾個不好聽的名號，不敢不掏出錢來買了回去，甯願來上幾天的不快活，不過，我們對這也得原諒，就是不當怨他招待的簡慢，而當怪那深種在各個人心的惰性的作祟，因爲他本人也是受了惰性的支配呀！</p>
<h3>爲富不仁者的遺象</h3>
<p>—</p>
<h3>品茗餘話</h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>茗之爲用，雖滌煩療渴，然揖讓之禮，亦寓乎其中。蓋禮之初，施諸飲食。賓至，主人先享以茗，醴次之，食又次之。故茗者，敬之寓也，禮之所由行也。自盧仝陸羽之流，或贊之以歌，或著之爲經，於是茶遂成爲有閒階級之嗜好品，而究及採藏烹煎諸事焉。</p>
<p>盧仝七椀，人皆知之。茶歌有贊七椀妙趣云：「一椀喉吻潤；二椀破孤悶；三椀搜枯腸，惟有文字五千卷：四椀發輕汗，平生不平事，盡向毛孔散：五椀肌骨淸；六椀通仙靈；七椀吃不得也，惟覺兩腋習習淸風生。」</p>
<p>各出佳茗，相與競飲，謂之「鬭茶」。范希文有鬭茶歌，蓋指武夷茶而言。茲節錄國茶一段，以見當時風尙：「……北苑將期獻天子，林下雄豪先國美。鼎磨雲外首山銅，瓶携江上中濡水；黃金碾畔綠雲飛，碧玉甌中翠濤起。鬭茶昧兮輕醍　，鬭茶香兮薄蘭芷。其間品第何能欺？十目視而十手指。勝若登仙不可攀，輸若降將無窮恥……」</p>
<p>竹裏煎茶，古人稱爲韻事。竹者何？竹爐也。此風雇時巳然。肅宗嘗賜高士張志和奴婢各一人，志和配爲夫妻，名之日，「漁童」，「樵靑」。人問其故。答曰：「漁童使捧釣收綸，產中鼓　：樵靑使蘇蘭薪桂，竹裏煎茶」。</p>
<p>左思嬌女詩日：「吾家有好女，皎皎常白晳：小字爲紈素，口齒自淸歷。貪走風雨中，倏忽數百適。心爲茶　劇，吹噓對鼎歷」。讀此，可想見茶之中入者深矣。</p>
<h3>採茶</h3>
<p>— 波光</p>
<p>綿亘數十里的山岳，植遍了很整齊的茶樹，經過了春雨的新沐，萌着嫩綠的細芽。</p>
<p>三三兩兩的少女，都集合在這山岳上，蹲着身體，伸出玲瓏的手指，攝取似米粒一般的茶芽。嘴里還唱很自然的山歌，非常悅耳，像黃鶯兒出谷一般</p>
<p>市集上的幾個靑年，在這艷陽天氣，漫山遍野的兜着圈子，欣賞這春郊風景，靑葱的麥葉，嫩黃的菜花，更有桃花和玫瑰，正在含苞待放，這幅富有詩意的美畫，只有住在農村的人們方能欣賞。</p>
<p>這許多採茶的女子，是絕少年長的婦人的。因爲婦人們另有紡織的工作，就利用少女的多閒來採茶，可是多刺的玫瑰，將來也是伊們手中的生活。</p>
<p>採茶的工作看來雖然不十分吃力，如果換了年紀大的人蹲在地下一天，也伸不起腰來。採了這些茶葉，回到家內，必須很好很留心的經過人工烘焙，纔得善價而沽。</p>
<p>每年的茶季，在這小小的四安鎭上，也有三十萬元的貿易，農村破產到這般地步，茶的貿易也不無小補呢。</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第一回　品茗作淸談夜窗縣雨　折枝　艷影花巷流芳</p>
<p>我知道你們在學堂裏讀書的學生，對於傳宗接後這句話，是不愛聽的。以爲這是老腐敗。但是我當年在你父親面前說過了這句話，我一定要辦到，才對得住你的父親。那少年站起來大聲笑道：母親未免把話越說越嚴重了。不過是爲了省用一個老媽子，何至於把話牽引得這樣的遠呢？一面笑着，可就站起身來，向堂屋裏走。老太太道。剛回家，你到那裏去？那少年笑道：家裏沒有下人啦，我自己到老虎灶上冲水去。終不成讓母親去冲水吧？老太太這倒沒有話說，頓了一頓，笑道：那麼。明天還要把劉媽呌了回來罷。這位老太太，一番深深的打算，只憑了愛子之心　動，就把原有的計畫給推翻了。原來這位老太太，雖是五十不到的人，他居孀是快有二十年了。他憑了省吃儉用，替　花店裏作些針活貼補着就把這個孤兒撫養大來。這孤兒姓章，自幼經長輩替他取了一個學名叫國器。人家也正因爲他母親立志撫孤，這孩子是應當走上正路的，取這兩個字，也無非是一種　勵之意。社會上的情形，總是矛盾的，越是有錢的人家子弟，有錢上學，有錢買書，書是總績不成功·反過來，窮人家的子弟沒有外物來引誘，家長希望旣大，督貨又嚴，自然是讀書有望。章國器自小就在附近一個敎會學校裹念書，因爲章老太每天股勤敎導的原故，狠是用功。而且性質是很馴良，從來不頑皮。因之學校常局很爲重視，又知道他家境實在是貧寒，索性把他的學費免了。國器一年大一年，知道得着學校免費的待遇，是一件不容易的事情，讀書就更用功了。在中學畢業以後他一方面在附屬小學裹當教員，一方面還在家裏　修中西文。有了閒空工夫，還做些小說筆記之類的文字到上海報館或雜誌社裏去投稿。起初原不過偶然高興，做兩篇文章消遣消遣。後來到每月稿發結算的時候，居然有一二十元的收入，很可以補貼他一點家用。這倒很引起了國器一種興味，心想，也不必再指望加多了，若是每月有這樣一筆確實的收入，除了家用之外，眞還可以買些書看。所以他每日自學堂敎畫回家，沒有第二件事，就是回到那間長式的書房裏去，伏案寫宇，這大他和母親談了那一番話，不免添了許多心事。（一四）</p>
<p>小人物誌</p>
<h3>石工出身的日本廣田首相</h3>
<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>日本自從事變之後；老朽內閣，完全解散。由廣田弘毅出任首相重相組新閣。雖前途尚黑暗重重。但廣田的聲譽，已經中外咸知了。</p>
<p>墨沙里尼是鐵匠店裏的小孩，希特勒是貧家子，斯太林的父親是皮鞋匠，麥唐納家裏是捕魚的。英雄不怕出身低，於是日本來了一個石工出身的廣田首相。日本的階級觀念是十分嚴厲的，大臣的年齡，都要在六十以上。現在以平民而爲首相，年齡又僅有五十九歲，確是所謂靑年內閣了。</p>
<p>廣田弘毅在幼時名丈太良佳在福岡市銀冶町。他的父親廣田德半和他的兄弟德右衛鬥至今還在那裏開着石器店，替人家刻墓碑和造石燈籠。日本的家庭和我國不同，父子的關係不深。兒子做了首相，父親不一定可以成爲不作一事的老封翁。從前德平因家貧入廣田石器店爲傭工，於是便改姓廣田，原來姓林，親戚早已中落了</p>
<p>廣田幼時在福岡小鐘小學讀書，家裏窮得連學費都要拖欠的。回家之後，幫着父親搬運石村，或是穿着工人衣服，出去收賬，到了端午節向農家販了些竹葉藺草，到街上去叫賣。</p>
<p>當時日本福岡有玄洋社的組織，是一種變相的政黨，月成功太郎爲魁。廣田在小學畢業時，日本的大隈外交大臣，因外交失敗，在馬車裏被人暗殺，將右脚炸去。這自刎的兇手，便是玄洋社的社員來島恒喜。廣田之所以能飛黃騰達，便是加入玄洋社的關係。</p>
<p>廣田在高小畢業之後，入修　館中學求學。加入玄洋社，學習柔道，研究陽明之學。他還入少林寺學禪，歸依僧門。至今他的西裝袋裹，時常有一串念珠的，中學時代，適逢日本戰勝滿淸，看見凱旋的將校，意氣揚揚。於是想做軍人，向士官學校報名投考。不久外交失敗，遼東半島，歸回我國，他便憤而和同學平田知夫到東京，預備學習外交。</p>
<p>日本政客大都要東京帝大畢業，於是兩個人只好肩了竹傘書包，徒步從大阪京都奈良走到東京，住在小石川的一間小崖裏。一時同鄉先輩　　，又成了一個團體，名其室爲「浩浩屋」。日本報紙稱他是梁山泊的。廣瀨淡窗曾做了一首詩，描寫他們的生活。「休道他鄉多辛苦，同胞有友自相親，柴　喨出霜如雪，君汲川流我拾薪。」</p>
<p>要入帝大，必須先進第一高等，於是他中了首名入舉。由頭山滿介紹，認識了外務省的山座圓次郎，他的能入外交界，均是山座提拔之力。後來讀到帝大二年的時候，日俄風雲緊急，需要國際情報。於是廣田便被派到朝鮮，偵探俄國的軍情。在營口上陸，乘車到旅順，被俄兵檢查。他連一句俄文也不懂的，由同車的我國人代他翻譯，把帝大的證明書拿了出來，說明到東三省旅行，方才過了難關，因爲那時兩國尙未開戰，否則早已做了階下囚了。</p>
<p>那時候帝大一個學生，便是將來的要人。況且廣出和外交界，十分聯絡，更有希望，於是富豪三菱的本家岩崎便想把女兒嫁他，不能成功。後來日本銀行總裁高橋是淸（即最近被殺的財政大臣）又拿了他女兒的照片，親自和廣田說親，又被他一口回絕了。</p>
<p>帝大畢業　的廣田，因爲英語成績惡劣，在外交官試騐中洛第了。翌　再孝，得第一名，到我北平爲公使隨員。住了二年，成了一位中國通。仟滿歸國，由頭山滿翁介紹和玄　社的月成功太郎的女兒靜子結褵。外交官的夫人，要跟着丈夫出勤歐美，所以大都生活歐美化的。獨有這位靜子夫人却是一個十足日本性的少婦，並沒有在歐洲學着絲毫的洋氣。現年五十二歲，連電戲也難得看一回的。</p>
<p>廣田在駐英公使任三等書記時，和幣原外相，意見相左，便轉仟爲荷蘭公使，再仟駐俄大使，那知他反而因此一飛衝天，漸漸的高昇起來了。</p>

<h3>身體自愈機能</h3>
<p>— 姚星叔</p>
<p>藥物對於疾病治療上，我們不能不承認有相當的意義與價值：允其如金雞納霜之於瘧疾，九一四之於梅毒，以及白喉的血淸治療，功效顯著，已毫無疑義。但千百種的藥物之內，捨此之外，像如此具有特效的，便幾乎可以說一聲不再有了。其餘各種疾病所用的藥物，對於疾病的治愈的作用，不過站在「從旁襄助」的地位：除去一部分需要手術治療的疾病，採用「一刀兩斷」的方法之外，許多的疾患得以痊愈，却是藉身體自家的力量，就是所謂身體自愈機能。</p>
<p>自愈機能這句話，在我國固有的醫籍裹雖然沒有看到，但已過去的人，却老早認識藥物的效力是怎樣了；「不藥爲中醫」，「藥之而愈，不藥亦愈」，「三分吃藥，七分調理」，由這幾句傳流的語句，可以證明前人已經知道疾病的治愈，並不完全是藥物的作用了。</p>
<p>疾病，尤其是諸種急性，慢性的傳染病，本來可以說是具有生活的身體對於外界害因的一種反應。當疾病發生的時候，身體固有的自愈機能便開始活動，以圖抵抗，這在實騐上可以證明，並非玄談。</p>
<p>事實上我們也可看見許多病症，尤其是患者因爲經濟的關係，沒有借重一點藥的力量，經過相當的時期，依樣得到痊愈，這便是自愈的機能的效果。普通一般人的見解，十有八九是迷信藥力萬能，不明白人體自身還有這一種自衛力量存在，眞是非常的愚昧。因此，社會裹服藥的風氣非常流行，並且竟有人以所服舶來藥物價値昂貴，誇耀於儕輩，吃藥還要認爲是一種虛榮。這樣的結果，於是造成功市儈投機，報紙上藥物廣告畸形的發達，以及一部分醫家處方之繁雜，好用成藥配製，在醫學先進的國家，是少所見到的。</p>
<p>可是，照以上所說，似乎疾病的醫療沒有什麼深邃的道理，除了特殊的幾種病之外，一個人若是病了，我們大可置之不理，聽其自然，但話不是這樣說法。</p>
<p>原來，有許多的病，病勢向前進行，而自愈機能發動遲緩，人體貴重的臟器——心臟——首先發生障礙，不能有助於病的痊愈；或者如老人小兒的自愈機能，不甚旺盛，這些都是有賴於吾人加以扶助，維持，促進了。</p>
<p>我們爲欲達到這樣的目的，所以病時除服相當藥物之外，不論飲食，起居，動定，都有一定的規定，這所以維持體力，發揮自愈的機能；但這在一般民衆，却漫不經心，認爲事屬小節，吃藥要緊，不肯身體力行。所謂自愈機能簡直是戕賊罷了，以至病是不愈，或是難愈，最後還要歸罪於醫藥，處置之失當</p>
<p>我不欲舉出許多事例，以免篇幅過於冗長。姑且拿一二個病症簡單說明一下。</p>
<p>說一說傷寒吧，傷寒是急性傳染病的一種，種類有好幾種，輕重緩急，正規與吾，雖同患傷寒，却是人各不同。這個病在現在還沒有特效的療法，醫學的智識及能力，祇能做到維持體力，讓身體自愈機能發展，以圖治愈，這呌做待期治療：於是飲食起居動定，由經騐上得來，遂有嚴格的限制。若是能早期診斷，早期警戒，除去本來身體過於尩瘠，或者發病的病原菌毒力過劇之外，大多數可以痊愈。　因爲病家缺少病時攝養的智識，或者是飲食不當，營養失調，或者不守安靜，心力早衰，不俟自愈機能充發展，遂登鬼籍，比比皆是。</p>
<p>再說肺癆，誰也知道是一個麻煩而凶險的病症。現代醫藥的能力，對於他，直接是毫無辦法，治愈與吾，又是依靠身體自愈的機能。若是一個肺癆患者，得到醫生早期診斷，——必須要早一點看出來，遲則不及，——實行營養療法，安靜安療法，注意日光空氣，加用一點相當的藥物，期以三年五載，必能完全恢復健康。可是普通的人不能明白這個道理，不能照樣實行，雖然注射吃藥，甚至施行手術治療，鬧得天翻地覆，最後還是免小了成爲癆肺之鬼。</p>
<h3>肺癆統計之世界觀（六）</h3>
<p>— 丁惠康</p>
<p>結核之經過，與種族之影響，在亞列物療養院中，Olive　view　Sanatorium有四三七八例之集合報告，均施以同一之待遇及治療，發現黑人患者之大半數，共死亡例甚高，而美國斯拉文人猶太人之死亡例，比較安全。此種材料之試騐及證明，在結核感受與種族關係之問題如何，尙屬疑問。</p>
<p>又Bowen氏之研究，亦有相當之價値，卽在各種不同種族之結核發生，與其各種不同之經過及傳染性，在威而斯地方，Wales有相當之證實，在該處高山間之居民，結核之經過，多爲急性進行者，而平原間之北方種族居民，多患慢性結核，在較高年齡中始行死亡。又在燃煤工業區域中，則不論何種人民，其死亡例之比例，適與上述者相反，其原因或爲高山間之居民，移向平地居住者，共抵抗力大的增進不少。北方種族之居民，因燃煤區域之灰塵關係，致消失共大部分之抵抗力。以故由平地生活轉成工業生活者，足以促進病勢之轉劇。</p>
<p>Gutinann氏之研究，以爲在同樣生活條件之下，猶太種族人民之結核死亡例，雖在經濟恐慌及不良之衛生情形中，較之其他民族爲佳良。猶太人民之此種特殊安全地位，或由於遺傳的保護能力，及疾病早期形成之增高抵抗力，此種情形，乃屬於特殊的，其他種族，尙乏同樣情形之發現。</p>
<p>若以以上種種的觀察而論，結核與種族的關係，究竟如何，雖用各種統計的方法，尙無證明，而解决此種問題。</p>
<p>關於大城市結核死亡例之統計，大多數較一般小城市間者爲高，至於結核死亡例增加興减少之原因，一般的觀察，共最有價値者，則結核爲一種社會病，而與公衆衛生之關係較少。反之，興一般的經濟情形如何，亦有相當之比例。無論如何，不良之居住情形，狹隘而稠密，如由鄉間移向城市者，均爲促成結核死亡例增高之原因。</p>
<p>紐約之結核死亡統計，雖因其區域之不同，居民種族之複雜，極速之繁榮，然現已减爲每一萬居民中僅爲七，三之結核死亡例矣。（一九二八年）同時在四十五個美國大城市之死亡例統計，在三千萬居民之總數中，平均爲八，一三死亡例。</p>
<p>芝加哥僅有六，六之死亡例，（每一萬居民中）較之紐約爲低。在西部諸城之死亡例，有僅三，五例者。惟在城市之中心點，共死亡例較之鄉間爲高。若以種族的統計而論，爲中國人有八十例，黑人四十例，依倫人民三十例，瑞典與挪威人二十例，意大利人十二，二例，俄羅斯之猶太人八，六例。（在每一萬居民中）此種種族差異的原因如何，雖因各種不同之情形，而難解决，惟公衆之情形如何，當然有特殊之關係焉。</p>
<p>鄉村與城市間結核死亡例之比例爲何如乎，以Chodzko氏在國聯萬國衛生處之觀察，則證明結核最高之死亡例，在工業不發達之農業區域。又近　以來，鄉村之結核死亡例，已漸漸增高，或且逾於城市間者矣。但美國　Mc　mullen氏之研究，如土白可林反應陽性之兒童，以百分計而論，爲九與七十一％之比，而此低峯之數目，乃屬於鄉村間者。又Flatzeck　氏亦以爲結核之傳染，在鄉村間平均爲較少云。</p>
<p>近年以來，鄉村間之結核死亡例，其遞减之程度，不及在城市間者之甚，果何故乎。此或由於鄉村間之結核死亡例，已達某種程度之最低峯。如以漢拿物及荷蘭地方如特蘭脫及開特倫諸省而論，則鄉村間之結核死亡例，較之城市間者爲高，其原因或由於統計及報告上之錯誤，鄉村間之家庭傳染，及大家庭制度，亦屬非常危險之原因。以　Ratibor統計之數目而觀，在鄉村間者有四，六六，在城市中有二九七屬於開放性結核之家屬被傳染者。</p>
<p>法國之報告，在鄉村間之幼童結核傳染，並不甚多。士白可林之陽性反應，多在十九歲前後始行發現，在成人則有六十　之陽性反應，最堪注意者，爲Sergent　及　Gonin二氏之證明，凡由鄉村遷往城市間居住之人民，在最初之二年以內，多有發生急性病變者，尤以兩性之靑年人爲多，此種患者，經過短時間之療治或療養，若歸回鄉村居住，以缺乏各種衛生之設備，遂致造成傳染病原絕大之危險。欲避免此種不幸之現象，祇有禁止居民由鄉間遷往城市之一法。而男子似較婦女尤多犧牲於結核者。饑饉及酒精二者，與結核症似尙無十分乏關係。</p>
<p>意大利之報告，則結核傳染與由城市歸回鄉村之居民，亦有莫大之關係。蓋意大利之中部及南部，氣候甚爲佳良，故結核之在鄉村，亦甚爲平和，而結核之傳染數，每與居民之稠密度爲正比例，尤以工業區爲甚云。</p>
<p>俄國關於農村方面之統計報告甚少，且不甚完全。歐戰之後，農村間之結核傳染驟增。至於農村及城市間之比較例，則不能確知。總之，凡鄉民居住之環境，生活之情形，嚴重之工作，酒精及不良之營養，及梅毒等，均與結核有極大之關係焉。</p>
<p>最重要者，爲結核死亡例，與各種不同年齡之關係。德國全境及普羅士省，會有二種之統計報告，直至一九三二年爲止，此項統計，極有價値，因在最近之五年內，將兩性之結核死亡例，曾分別統計也。</p>

<h3>牙齒常識問答（三〇）</h3>
<p>— 林鑑賢</p>
<p>（第一四五問）食物應該怎樣煮製？</p>
<p>答　食物愈新鮮，愈近天然狀態愈好，未經煮過的食物，滋餐料量足，含維他命最富，卽對於牙齒最爲有益。屈立司探海島的居民，因環境的關係，生活至苦，但全島兒童，因慣用生乳，幾無一生蛀牙的。古代人民體格之强，牙齒之堅，恐怕大半是茹毛飲血生食的功勞。食物完全生食，我們恐怕辦不到，而且有病菌和寄生蟲的危險。爲消滅虫菌和適口起見，固然要烹飪，不過但求熟食適口爲度，不宜烹煮過久，或過於加工加料的精製。凡加熱過久之物，或過鹹過奮之物，如醃臘等品，維他命旣喪失，又難於消化，榮養價値很少，都不宜於牙齒。</p>
<p>（第一四六問）　糙米爲什麼較白米爲有益於牙齒？</p>
<p>答　糙米外面這層粃，所含的維他命，蛋白質，鑛鹽等，均較米的自身爲多，對於牙齒和全身，均極滋補。而且糙米飯又可磨練牙齒。精米所煮的白飯，雖然瑩潔可觀，但所含的多係澱粉，遠不及糙米飯的滋補。麥子也是這樣，有麩皮的麵粉較白麵粉爲有益。我國以米麥爲主要食品，但多過於精製，减却天然的滋養料，極宜提倡改良，則食一碗飯可得一碗半之益。有謂糙米飯粗硬難食，是因煮不得法，如果多加些水多煮，香味反較白米爲佳，常食自無不慣。</p>
<p>（第一四七問）　爲什麼要常食粗糙或多含纖維的食品？</p>
<p>答　我們如果專食柔軟的食品，牙齒因爲不用的緣故，就會退化，體弱易懷。必須常會粗糙的或富有纖維的食物，以磨練牙齒，並可自然的淸掃結附着牙齒的食屑，所以這種食品，呌做淸掃食品，（Cleansing　food），如果我們每餐食事將畢時，食些蔬菜如芹菜靑菜鹽菜竹筍等，或水果如蘋果等，均很有益。</p>
<p>（第一四八問）　爲什麼太硬的食品，不宜於牙齒？</p>
<p>答　粗糙的食物固然是好，但太硬的食物，咀嚼時常易用力過猛，有損傷牙磁的危險；如硬殼果實，硬的糖果，乾炒的硬蠶豆等，若牙齒沒有練到十分堅强，食時皆宜謹愼。</p>
<h3>肺結核淺說（八八）</h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>結核菌不能滅絕之理由，旣如上面所述？但是我要十分鄭重地敬告讀者們，就是：千萬不要因此而悲觀，抱一種「跬步才蹈，荊棘已生」；的態度；結核菌過度之恐怖，產生無數神經衰弱者，結果反爲易罹結核之素因；這是狠要不得的！須知無結核菌卽無結核症，固屬眞理：但結案菌一侵入人體，並不是一定卽構成本症，他是需要另外之機會方成的。所以儘敢世界上全體入類，事實上都免不了結核菌的侵襲，但結果完全構成本症者，終究還只一部分，决不是全數或大多數。况且在結核全部患者中，事實上並不是個個都陷於不治的，何必深抱「杞入之憂」呢？第二：更不要因爲結核菌之滅絕，不能成爲事實，而忽視我們的消極預防方針：以謂避免結核菌接觸一層，橫堅是辦不到，實行預防方針與吾，不過如百步之與五十步：還不如完全放任，祗須抵抗力充足，並不一定會構成本症的。此其爲說之謬誤，以及流弊之大，是更加不堪設想的。不錯，所謂消極預防一層，無疑地是一種不徹底的工作。但就我們已知的範圍來講，所謂本症患者的喀痰以及衣服用具等種種之易爲侵襲他人之媒介一層，其事實係昭然若揭的。根據已知的事實，儘量採用現在可能範圍內種種方法來防止他，是我們唯一之目的！他的成績，雖不能滿足我們的最高慾望，但和完全放任相比較，共相差係决對不可並論的。誠然，有人時和本症患者接近，結果並未被傳染成病，這一類事實，我們當然不加吾認，但無論如何是極少數，我們决不能因極少數的僥倖，而抹殺大多數的事實；有如父患梅毒，其子並未患先天性梅毒，我們也不能因這一點例外，而謂梅毒遺傳之說是無稽的。所以儘敢事實上不能滅絕結核菌，决對避免結核菌接觸不能辦到，但對於消極的預防種種，總究不能不儘量採納的。</p>
<p>關於預防方法種種，以及如何施行之處，爲尋常一般病者及非病者不可不明瞭的，現在且一一分述於下面：</p>
<p>第一節　消極的預防</p>
<p>滅絕社會上之結核菌，爲消極的預防唯一之目的，此結核菌大都生存於人體內結核病灶中，而散布結核菌於外界之媒介，則肺結核患之咯痰是；所以如何處置本病患者之咯痰，爲預防上第一件大事。但是我們還要蟯得，此種帶危險性之咯痰，不僅係患進行性本症者之專利品，有許多初期或輕症的本病患者們，表面上看來，幾和康健人一樣，但他的咯痰中結核菌却數見不鮮，這當然使人人都易於忽略的！所以醫學上對於一切稍有本症嫌疑者，都非加以詳細檢查不可；對於隔離與吾一層，也應該和診斷確定之患者，加以同樣之注意方行的。再進一步說，凡發生咳嗽多痰症狀的人們，均可目爲結核傳染之嫌疑犯，爲防患未然計，也應該和本病患者之咯痰，施以同樣之檢查或處置，方可一勞永逸的！</p>

<h3>面皰症</h3>
<p>— （朱秋元）</p>
<p>面皰俗稱粉刺。靑年男女。在十五六歲至二十五六歲者。往往患之。發生地位。在面頰前額鼻樑等處。狀如帽針頭之黑點。與皮脂腺口。完全一致。出側方用力擠壓。則有脂肪性之細長灰白色線條。自內排出。爲皮脂皮屑塵垢之混合物。面皰之底層。有發生痤瘡之小結節者。亦有三數小面皰。互相通連。成爲大面皰者。面皰之發生。由於皮脂之分泌引起障得。治療方法。先將皰中雜質。盡量擠出。用肥皂加以洗净。然後敷以『面麗』香膏。蓋面麗能使皮脂暢達無阻。一方能使毛孔縮小。皮膚立見細膩白嫩。而一方尤能保護皮膚。使塵垢雜質。無由毛孔混入。故已串面皰者。可望速愈。即未患之人搽之。亦有預防之功效也。</p>
<h3>胃病之療治</h3>
<p>— （仲弢）</p>
<p>胃乃消化器管。於吾人之榮養上。殊爲切要。飲食入胃粘膜分泌胃液。胃壁蠕動不巳。俾食塊充分消化。變爲糜粥。至於腸內。腸壁吸收共精華。以入於血。隨血流而運達全身各組織細胞。始可維持寳貴之生命焉。茍胃一旦罹病。則食慾不佳。胃液及蠕動俱弱。食塊不克完全消化。於是組織細胞胥不得其食料，以致身體日瘦。百　叢起。由此觀之。胃於人生。關係豈不大乎。嘗見我國同胞。面黃肌瘦。形容枯槁。一經診察。大率皆患有胃病。夫胃病者。原因極多。症候複雜。其初發現象。多。呈惡心。嘔氣。食思缺損。吞酸。嘈雜。頭痛。頭暈。繼則胃部膨滿。疼痛發作。如灼如揉。如刺如　。以致作事不能勞心勞力。顏色憔悴。精神疲憊。療治之法。莫若購服『胃必靈』。此藥可促胃液之分泌。增進胃壁之蠕動。助消化。通血脈。開胃定痛。破積理氣。效騐之靈。難以詳述。（編者按。『胃必靈』係同仁西藥社經售。地點。在上海法大馬路。西新橋街。德行里一號。價目每盒一元。輕症一盒即愈。。即日久之肝胃氣痛。亦祇須二三盒耳）</p>
<h3>面麗確然值得介紹</h3>
<p>— （韓鼎元來稿）</p>
<p>『面麗確然値得介紹』。在我試驗過面麗之後。腦海中却起了這一個感想。這並不是凑熱鬧。事實是這樣的。我的一個遠房嬸娘。他生了兩面孔的雀斑。尤其在鼻部及鼻的四週。濃而且密。他雖不要學什麼摩登。但耳聽眼見別人家說面麗除斑去皰的好處。禁不起也要試試。當時就託我去買了一瓶。依法搽用。雖然不是一瓶就好。但是却稀疏了許多。後來接着兩瓶三瓶的搽着。果然在三瓶之後。却把滿面的雀斑化爲鳥有。掃除净盡。他固然喜歡的了不得。連我也奇怪起來。面麗的功効。眞是不可思議。從此患雀斑面皰的。有了這面麗。將不知要治好多少人面部的不美觀哩。</p>
<h3>急性淋治療實例</h3>
<p>— （景階）</p>
<p>因淋病之初起。其病灶範團。大槪僅限於尿道局部者爲最多。所以又有淋毒性尿道炎者之名種。普通尿道炎之原因。種類頗多。槪言之。約分四種。曰化學的害因。寒熱的害因。器械的害因。及細菌的害因是也。就中以細菌的害因。約占炎症原因百分之六十以上。而細菌爲尿道炎咨因之最多者。首推淋病發球菌。此菌侵入尿道粘膜。即起化膿而腫賬疼痛。是即所謂淋毒性尿道炎。而實際上亦即淋病之症狀成立矣。有張金發者。爲工廠機司。偶因狎妓。隔日忽覺排尿疼痛。尿道口流出膿汁。乞診於余。遂令放尿玻璃杯中。混濁而有雲絮及絲條之浮遊小體。用顯微鏡查驗。則見淋病雙球菌。星羅棋佈於膿球之內外。斷爲急性淋症。彼因職責關係。事實上不能按日來診。問余應服何樂。即囑其聽『哥那多登』三盒。按日服之。旬日後。復來余處，見共精神舒適。已恢復常態。再爲之檢驗小便　已不復有淋菌之存在矣。初不料『哥那多登』之功效。有若是之速且偉。是誠堪爲自療者法矣。（編者按。「哥那多登」爲近代治淋病之標準內服藥。中西醫家。巳有不少實騐。其售價每盒二元。總經理處。爲上海法大馬路西新橋街德行里一號。同仁西藥社云。）</p>
<h3>甘露治愈鬎鬁記</h3>
<p>— （雍然）</p>
<p>上海法租界西新橋街德行里一號。同仁西藥社出品之「甘露」藥水。（每瓶售洋一元）爲皮膚病之特效製劑。其治癬瘡等疾患。奏效之神且速。夙爲中外醫師所稱道。予臨症上屢喜用之。茲將用「甘露」治愈　痢頭之一例。述之於下。</p>
<p>許小靑君。予友薛洪勳先生之令甥也。現年十四歲。肄業於某初中學校。向患癩痢頭。屢治不愈。同學頗厭惡之。賜以渾號曰石灰小靑。頃乃求治於予。察其體格中等。除頭患癩痢外。別無他種疾病。全頭皮膚。殆成赤禿。僅殘存幾根疎髮。且放一種臭氣。望之儼若平沙水草。寒山樹木然。乃囑其每日以「甘露」藥水。自行塗治。二月後其母購一豚蹄。二籃蘋果。造予門而謝日。小靑癩痢。完全愈矣。毛髮漸生長矣。其諸同學復相謂曰。石灰小靑。今已靑靑。噫。癩痢頭。皮膚病也。何竟受人之譏誚若此。幸望世之患斯疾者。曷速購『甘露』以塗治之。</p>
<h3>白帶之害</h3>
<p>— （潛菴）</p>
<p>凡婦女生殖器之各部疾患。皆有發生白帶之症象。排出多量之　液性分泌物。共主症大率爲慢性子宮內膜炎。在身體較肥胖之婦女。外陰部及大腿內側之皮膚。因分泌物之刺戟。而發腫脹。灼熱而至糜爛。痛癢俱來。殊爲苦惱。白帶原因之最多者。由於傳染。而主要者又以淋病爲最多。凡淋菌侵入子宮粘膚。發生子宮內膜炎者。幸而受胎。往往流產。患者每不明自身所病之原因。旣病而羞不願醫。以致淋菌上行。蔓延而起子宮頸管粘膜炎。子宮內膜炎。喇叭管炎。卵巢炎。子宮周圍腹膜炎等。而卒妊娠不能。豈非大謬也哉。今有極簡易之方法。能使染有淋菌之白帶。及普通之白帶。均可於最短時期。霍然而愈。其法乃以「內服白帶丸」及「外用白帶藥」兩種同時並用。內外兼施。無不克奏全功。該兩藥由上海法大馬路西新橋街德行里一號。同仁西藥社經售。價每種每盒各售二元。</p>

<h3>漢奸的下塲</h3>
<p>— 信</p>
<p>近據報載，僞與北省省長淩陞，警務處長春德，警備軍第一軍參謀長齡，秘書官華義泰，以與蘇俄及外蒙通欵，被處死刑，閱報者每爲此四人惜，以爲此四人者，能暗結蘇蒙，反抗日僞，此種漢奸，尙有可僞，並非漢奸之至劣者，今因謀叛發覺，而慘遭處决，殊足痛惜，</p>
<p>其實此種漢奸，眞有取死之道，所謂自投羅網者也，大凡旣做漢奸，而又不甘爲漢奸，或謀反正，或另圖暗結別種勢力者，其原因有三，</p>
<p>第一種，祇圖陞官發財，及做漢奸已久，見無官可陞，無財可發，未能滿足其慾望，於是鬱鬱不得志，欲別謀發展，另覓生路者，</p>
<p>第二種，欲借外人的力量，而做復辟的好夢，殆至傀儡形成，乃知爲人所賣，而大夢方醒，於是別謀方法，而欲貫澈共原來之主張者，</p>
<p>第三種，無法抵抗强暴，不得不偷安茍生，暫保祿位，一俟有隙可乘，再圖恢復失地，一雪前恥者，迨機會難得，而心又不甘，於是別出心裁，力圖脫離者，</p>
<p>以上三種漢奸，前二種本不足道，若後一種，其立心雖較光明，然一受僞職，卽爲漢奸，旣爲漢奸，卽在某種勢力指揮監督之下，供其奔走，事已如此，而再欲脫離覊絆，自屬甚難，蓋一受牢籠，卽爲箝制，稍洩機密，禍卽隨身，嫌疑之間，事本難處，况旣事僞，人格何存，漢奸下塲，本當如此，</p>
<p>故人有人的立塲，國有國的立塲，聯俄親蒙，原屬自由，本無不可，但一膺僞職，卽受僞命指揮，一通俄蒙，便爲叛逆，叛逆者死，理有固然，是以凌陞，春德，福齡，華霖泰之死，原屬無可逃避者也，凌陞等之爲漢奸，於三者之中，性屬何種，尙不可知，而其爲取死之道則一也，故我因凌陞等之死，而不得不爲漢奸者略一道之，</p>
<h3>憂鬱</h3>
<p>— 丁厂</p>
<p>每次到　　工廠宿舍去找克林，我總會遇着那個胖肚子的暮年自俄衛警，在門口外一條凳子上坐着。他是那麼沮喪着一張臉，像沉於睡眠的狀態中，兩隻憂鬱的眼珠子深藏在瘦凹的眼眶里，似在感傷着他林昔的繁榮的夢。</p>
<p>偶然從他身邊有幾個行人沙沙地走過去，這就立刻打動他的心，說不上是怎麼的，他驚惶地便霍地抬起腦袋來看幾眼，然後，然後，又像是沉於睡眠的狀態中了。</p>
<p>他是一個衰老的異國的流浪人！家鄉在遼遠的Mangtcb河畔。這是他用手指在地上畫給我看的。</p>
<p>他還苦訴了一些異國生活艱難給我聽。他說他在哈爾濱住了好多年，後來給生活逼得沒法，便在三年前流浪到瀋陽來。</p>
<p>他的半生光陰在異國的風塵中，潦倒的過去，如今只贏了一身憂鬱。衰老的心是悽痛的。臉光是削瘦的，却逝去了笑的光芒！他的靑春就如輕夢似的溜遠了：光榮的春也會變作秋天的慘象呵！</p>
<p>初次去找克林，我走到他們的宿舍的大門口便停下脚步，對坐在登子上那個沉於睡眠的狀態中的老衛警，浮着笑臉：</p>
<p>—老先生，麻煩你，我要見　　組克林。</p>
<p>—克林？恐怕到機塲工作去了。說着那麼動聽的極流利的中國語。</p>
<p>—他白天沒有工作，是晚班。—晚班？好的，那麼我給你去找。殷動地走了。</p>
<p>這樣，我因一次一次的去找克林，那個老衛警對我算熟識了。他愛和我談話。他的話就是那麼和藹。有一次，他對我這麼問：</p>
<p>—你和克林是什麼關係？</p>
<p>—是在中學同學。笑着，我是擺動着腦袋。</p>
<p>—你在什麼機關作事？</p>
<p>—沒有職業，是新從縣城中來　。</p>
<p>—那麼找克林幹什麼？</p>
<p>—想讓他給介紹到工廠作工。</p>
<p>—怎麼？你也要作工嗎？</p>
<p>—是的。不作工要挨餓呀。</p>
<p>—呵呵……</p>
<p>—老先生，你什麼時侯來中國的？</p>
<p>—好久，好久以前了。</p>
<p>—已經老了呵？</p>
<p>—老了，老了，好死的入了！快要入墳墓了。</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>他嘆息着，話是那麼的悲傷。</p>
<p>—家呢？</p>
<p>—那呢有家？就是孤獨的一個人呀！結婚以來就沒生下兒女。妻，又在三年前死在哈爾濱。Mangtch河畔雖然曾有我的家，然而，我不能回去，不能回去！唉，我早晚就要死在瀋陽呵！</p>
<p>老淚是一滴一滴的從眼眶子里流下了。</p>
<p>從此，我每當去找克林，他必定要我坐在他的凳子上，對我說上幾分鐘的話，然後，才能把克林給我找來。</p>
<p>等我和克林辦完了事，要走了，他就握着我的手：</p>
<p>—再見，再見！</p>
<p>說着，說着，在他那削瘦的臉上微微掠起一片笑影。</p>
<p>走得不遠，我就停下脚步，回過頭去看了看，他又在沮喪着臉坐在凳子上，依然像是沉於睡眠的狀態。</p>
<h3>愛娜（續）</h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>約摸着將近晚飯的時分，有兩個從酒罐里爬出來的客入走進來，醉醺醺地，不知他們怎麼會那麼老眼昏花，只一看就挑上了阿毛和小妹，這，給了愛娜重大的打擊，意識到在今天怕不會有什麼希望的了。</p>
<p>過了十點鐘，這里的空氣緊張起來，一間一間的小屋子里，笑，笑，姿情的嬌馬，那一套媚眼，那一套推拿的魔術，眞够人受用，總之，空氣在這時像快炸了的油鍋。</p>
<p>死不掉的老張又佔據了愛娜的這間屋子。不知怎麼，愛娜一看見老張的那一叢小鬍子就會生氣，惡心，不錯，連續的他曾在她的身上下過幾翻功夫，結果，她只用一個「失望」把他打發回去。</p>
<p>自然，生意不容許她不接受的，當他在浴池里跳出來以後，照舊的，她把那一套本領加在他的身上，由上身以至於下身，手在不停的擂着。</p>
<p>突的，他把她拉住了：「你有什麼事不快活呢？」頓了一下：「不用想那些吧！你聽，人家的屋子里在笑呢！」幾根小鬍子快連成一條綫了。</p>
<p>她知道在這色情的都會里，祇要肯犧牲，她能收到意外的代價的，那時候一切像雲霧迷住了她的心竅，家庭，姐姐，本身，………大的輪廻的走馬燈呵！</p>
<p>打烊的時候，老張才走了，三張花票子放在小圓凳上，愛娜看着他的背影由甬道里衝出去，她的手在顫抖了。</p>
<h3>孩子</h3>
<p>— 林淡秋</p>
<p>很久沒見面的章君夫婦昨夜突然踏進我的房門。丈夫臉上浮着慘笑，眼圈發紅，像剛流過淚或快要流淚的樣子。夫人呢，完全是副哭喪臉。</p>
<p>「孩子死了，沒錢買棺材，想問你借五塊錢。」章臉色一沉，苦痛得像挖去了心肝，慘笑不見了。</p>
<p>「晤」黃臉孔，尖嘴巴，凸眼睛，一看見我就「叔叔，叔叔」呌個不住的孩子在我腦子裏一閃，我發呆了，回不出話來。</p>
<p>「這孩子死得可憐。病了兩禮拜，沒看過一次醫生。……起初病是很輕的。」章夫入眼睛䀹了幾䀹,䀹出了發光的淚水。</p>
<p>章的眼圈紅得更利害了。</p>
<p>「不要難過呀，我們這種人原不配有孩子的。」我彷彿忘了他們向我借錢的事，我只想用理智的武器來克服他們的悲傷。</p>
<p>「我發誓不再生孩子。」章咬牙切齒地說。</p>
<p>章夫人瞥了丈夫一眼，悽慘的脸容闪出一丝獰笑，比哭还難看的獰笑。</p>
<p>「錢有沒有，錢？」章重新提起錢，四隻濕汪汪的眼睛一齊盯住我的嘴巴。</p>
<p>我呆了一呆。</p>
<p>我自己白天借了一整天，才借到三塊錢付飯費，再借五塊是十二分困難的事。但我一時總覺得不願意對他們說出實情，我該給自己苦難的朋友一點希望，雖然這希望未必不會變成更大的失望。</p>
<p>「我自己沒有錢，明天一早就替你們設法去。…不過同時你們到別處也設法設法，…萬一…」</p>
<p>半夜，我做了一個可怕的夢：</p>
<p>妻披散着長長的頭髮，眼淚鼻涕混成一片，在地上滾，哭，喊：「我不要做人了，我不要做人了；……」母親坐在竹椅上，滿臉怒容，乾　的老眼飽含着淚水，從顫抖的雙唇送出顫抖的聲音「大家看呀，這潑婦，這潑婦……」</p>
<p>「什麼事，什麼事呀？」我瞧瞧妻的淚臉，又瞧瞧母親的怒容。</p>
<p>「什麼事呢！」母親看見我踏進門口，驀地吃了一驚。「你一年一年不回家，這潑婦熬不住，就天天跟我作對。…動不動呼天喊地，做無賴。…看呀，這潑婦。」</p>
<p>妻突然掙起身，坐在地上，不再大聲哭喊了，但低聲的哽咽却益發劇烈起來，使她渾身都搐搦着。</p>
<p>「你幹麼破口傷…傷人呢？…一開口就是絕…絕種貨…雄鷄…丈夫不回家，我能生孩子嗎？」</p>
<p>母親憤憤地雙唇抖得更利害了，彷彿有氣沒處發洩似的。她驀地站起身，衝到妻跟前，發狂似的頓着小脚，咬牙切齒地送出惡毒的臭罵：</p>
<p>「我講錯了嗎，潑婦？…你會生孩子嗎？你不是雄鷄嗎？……哈，丈夫在外面，拜堂時光總在家的呀！你肚子幹麼不大起來呢？…潑婦，說呀！說呀，潑婦…」</p>
<p>像稍稍熄滅下來的猛火突又被潑上滾油，妻的憤怒和悲哀達到空前的頂點了。她又仆臥在地上，拚死命地滾着，碰着，哭喊着。……</p>
<p>一會兒後，她突然止住哭喊，一滾身跳起來，在桌上針綫籃裏抓起一把生銹的剪刀，對準自己的喉嚨一刺，就射出一支噴泉似的血流。衆人驚呌一聲，我展開兩臂衝上前去一抱，抱了一個空，醒了。我慶幸這不過是一塲夢，但這夢委實使我担心，因爲我想起許多夢樣的事實。</p>
<p>驀地想起昨夜的諾言，我得趕快起身替章的孩子的死屍去惜錢。……</p>

<h3>新歌介紹</h3>
<p>車夫歌</p>
<p>南京新運總會製新生活車夫歌，頒發各地新運會傳習，歌詞如下：</p>
<p>車夫歌，唱與車夫聽，車子停，要向指定地點停，車子行，要向道路左邊行，行時兩車不要並，空車行走更要緊，搶路須防撞旁人，闖禍都因不小心，警察指揮你要遵。</p>
<p>車夫歌，唱與車夫聽，車夫執業不微輕，立身行事却要穩，號掛尸規定，執照是憑證，隨車穿帶備查問，車上遺物不要吞，投報警局最要緊，不然查獲被拘留，一生名譽都丟盡，下回主顧無人問。</p>
<p>車夫歌，唱與車夫聽，新生活，民族興，大家努力來實行，香酒不吸酒不飲，守定秩序安本分，衣褲穿着要乾净，墊褥收拾要齊整，對待客人要和平，講定價錢要守信。</p>

<p>邵柏靑……周衍</p>
<p>金漢亭……黃河</p>
<p>金寶</p>
<p>這是江南沿着京滬綫的某縣城外的一個農村。一個秋末冬初的傍晚：</p>
<p>金寶是一個十七歲的年靑姑娘，長得美麗而又活潑，她有一個年紀很大的父親——周光炎，父女二人相倚爲命，耕種着十幾畝田地，倒也很安樂的過着歲月，可是這二年來大水，旱災，把他們苦了下來。父親借了田主金家總管邵柏靑的重利錢，因此今年雖然是豐年，田裹稻子很豐滿，但是沒有到自己要去割的時候，已被邵柏靑派人來割了去。當然這樣一來，田主金家的租又落空了，拿什麼來還呢？這一個問題眞把周光炎焦急死了！</p>
<p>但是光炎想到田主金少爺很愛她的兒女兒金寳，他馬上這念頭又轉到金寳身上去，想把金寳嫁給金少爺，不是什麼都解决了嗎？</p>
<p>不過金寳呢？金寳與別的鄉村姑娘不一樣，她有淸醒的頭腦，自然她不願意去嫁給金少爺，那末更談不到愛上他了。</p>
<p>金寳跟同村的一個誠實勇敢的靑年李雲哥，彼此早就愛上了，而且他們早就說妥，金寳要嫁除非嫁給雲哥，雲哥要娶除非娶金寳。</p>
<p>金少爺實在愛透了金寳，因此他想出種種方法來想把金寳弄到手，雖然有光炎硬逼，錢寳坤的軟騙，但是眞愛情不是金錢與勢力所買得到的。余寳雖受到這封建殘餘勢力所壓迫，可是倒並沒有動搖她向光明前途的進取，她到底都是抱着决心掙扎，奮門！</p>
<p>殘餘封建勢力的壓迫下，是造成了一幕悲劇！</p>
<p>不過這悲劇並非是屈伏，牠是象徵着未來的光明！</p>

<p>電影</p>
<h3>「桃源春夢」的偉大佈景</h3>
<p>韓蘭根劉繼羣合作過「如此英雄」一片，大家就呌他們爲中國的勞萊哈台，而且直到現在，他們二人還實在是中國影界數一數二的滑稽明星，所以，現在將韓蘭根劉繼羣聘來，再合作一部滑稽影片，這一定是影迷們所急切盼望的。在生意眼方面度量下來，新華公司的「桃源春夢」很有營業上的把握。</p>
<p>「桃源春夢」裏有一塲佈景，要佈置一個偉大的桃花源，本來是預備離開上海到別地方去拍外景的，但現在决定在攝影塲要把牠搭起來了。這塲佈景，非但要大數量的燈光，如果沒有廣大的空地也辦不到。所以新華公司拍這一塲戲，打算在新近購下的斜土路對面的十一畝大空塲上搭置，這是新華公司擴展以後的新攝影塲，預料這一塲大佈景開拍的時候，參觀的人一定很多，而且有接連五個晚上的戲。算是懿歟盛哉！</p>
<h3>「新舊上海」演員營</h3>
<p>英茵　英茵，如加入明星不久的一個健康的新人，到明星第一個作品便是這個「新舊上海」，戲是並不算，但在並不多的戲當中，英茵是可以使你　刻的認識了她。</p>
<p>謝雲卿　謝雲卿眞是多能，他是可以演「白相人」，可以演「紳士」，可以演「苦老頭子」，各色各樣，他是都可以愉快勝任，「新舊上海里」，他是演了一個「等於失業」的苦商人。</p>
<p>高步霽　過去，高步霄是演了一點片段的戲，「新舊上海」是有了他完整的演出，演一個擱樓上的小學敎員。</p>
<p>尤光照　尤胖子光照，噱頭製造者，演一個亭子問裏的房客，是一個汽車夫，演出的成績，是更進了一步了。</p>
<p>王吉亭　是一個只想着問房束老太婆要錢去賭的兒子，一個典型的「小抖亂」人物，演得很酷肖。</p>
<p>譚志遠　有茶館裏談天說地的健談客入，是覺得上海不景氣而連幾個酥餅上落下的芝蔴也搜集到口裏。</p>
<p>二房東太太和　廂房房客　王獻齋舒繡文主演「新舊上海」</p>

<h3>End of Tianjin-Japan Military Officer Conference; Yongjian and Matsumuro Visited Song Zheyuan Yesterday; Concrete Expressions on Foreign Affairs, Focus Still on Anti-Communism; Ishii Flew to Changchun with Records</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Yongjian and Matsumuro visited Song Zheyuan at Song's residence at No. 133, 17th Road, British Concession at 5 PM on the 27th. They made concrete expressions regarding the results of the North China military officers' conference, concerning both foreign affairs and anti-communism. Xiao and the two Chens were present. The focus of the conversation remained on further measures for anti-communism. They departed at 6 PM, with potential for continued discussions on the 28th. (Special Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The North China-Japan military officers' conference concluded on the evening of the 26th. There were no meetings on the morning of the 27th, including with military officer Wachi. Sui Yushan flew back to his post on plane No. 129 on the morning of the 27th. The chief of the Yuguan special affairs agency, Hosoki, and the commanders of the garrisons in Yuguan, Tangshan, and Tanggu departed Tianjin on the night of the 27th. Military officers Oomoto and Ishino were scheduled to return to Zhangjiakou and Jinan, respectively, on the morning of the 28th. Ishii, a senior staff officer from the Tianjin military department, flew to Changchun at 7 AM on the morning of the 27th on plane No. 502, carrying the records of the military officers' conference, for liaison purposes. He will stay for one day before returning to the country to report and attend the chiefs of staff meeting. Matsumuro stated that the military officers' conference only lasted one day, during which they listened to Chief of Staff Yongjian's report and conveyed the central government's opinions. There was no gathering today, and the military officers returned to their posts one after another. He and Hamada plan to return to Peiping in about three days. There were no plans to meet with Chairman Song in Tianjin. While anti-communism in North China is indeed important, it was not discussed in this conference. No anti-communist agreement was signed between China and Japan; there was only an exchange of information. The suppression of communists in Shanxi is progressing smoothly, and it seems that there is no danger in Hebei and Chahar. Currently, there are no so-called diplomatic matters between China and Japan. The Hebei-East Chahar issue is a matter within the Hebei-Chahar territory and should be handled by the Hebei-Chahar authorities themselves. The Japanese side is currently discussing matters related to garrison deployments and has nothing to do with the abolition of the Hebei-East government. These discussions are being held in Tianjin, and there are no preparations for any formal meetings to be convened in Peiping. (Special Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Although Hebei-Chahar diplomacy has progressed to a considerable extent after the exchange of views between Xiao Zhenying and Yongjian, the rumors that a so-called anti-communist agreement has been signed have been strongly denied by both parties. The Japanese side's request for joint anti-communism has not been accepted by our side, as we consider it an internal matter. Our side's hope to abolish the Hebei-East organization and restore Chahar to its original state has also not been realized. Although the opinions of both sides are not completely consistent, a minimum compromise has gradually been found through open and frank negotiations in recent days. It is heard that the content of the anti-communist agreement under discussion includes: 1. Not infringing upon our country's sovereignty; 2. Not interfering in our internal affairs; 3. The Hebei-Chahar authorities will independently carry out anti-communism, and stipulations are made on how to arrange defenses internally before the communist bandits invade the borders of Hebei and Chahar, and how to suppress them if they invade. Only after this issue is resolved can discussions on the Hebei-East and Chahar issues begin. (Special Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Chen Zhongfu Goes to Tianjin to Meet Song</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chen Zhongfu went to Tianjin this morning to meet Song and assist Xiao Zhenying in handling Hebei-Chahar negotiations. Military Officer Imai was originally scheduled to return to Peiping today to attend the spirit summoning ceremony, but the trip was cancelled due to the ongoing negotiations in Tianjin. (Special Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Matsumuro's Office to be Expanded</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese side is planning to purchase the original site of the Austrian Embassy, where Matsumuro Xiaoliang resides, to expand Matsumuro's office. Outside rumors suggest that the place will be used as the headquarters of the North China garrison, but those concerned deny it. (Special Dispatch, 27th)</p>

Deng stated that the members of the Legal System Committee of the Hebei-Chahar Political Committee have been appointed by the Political Committee, and he has been designated as the Chairman. He visited Song in Tianjin and had some discussions on internal organization, but no concrete decisions have been made yet. Shi Zhiquan and Yu Tianxiu have been appointed as advisors to conduct research. It is expected that the committee can be established in mid-May. The Legal System Committee is a research and discussion body, not an executive agency. Song has no fixed date to return to Peiping, and he will not go elsewhere for the time being. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Hebei-Chahar Political Committee recently decided to establish a Legal System Committee. On the 27th, it announced Deng Zhexi, Ting Yong, Zhang Youqing, Xing Zanting, and Jiang Gongliang as members, with Deng as the Chairman.

<h3>Three-Day Warships to Temporarily Anchor at Tanggu</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Three Japanese destroyers, "Aoi," "Kiku," and "Hagi," from the Lushun Naval Base, arrived at Tanggu on the afternoon of the 25th, taking advantage of the tide.

<p>(Changsha) Chairman Chiang departed from Guiyang by Boeing aircraft at 12:20 PM on the 27th and landed at the Xinhe Airport in Changsha at 4:00 PM in the afternoon.

When Chairman Chiang got off the plane, military music was played loudly, and Chairman He Jian led all the welcoming personnel to salute. Chiang returned the salute to the welcoming personnel and the public one by one. Chiang wore a grass-yellow Zhongshan suit and looked radiant. He walked for about a li, observing the welcomers lined up on the left and right. They were neat, solemn and smiley. Then he and He Jian rode in a car to the city, and Qian Dajun, director of Chiang's attendant room, Wang Shihe and others followed in cars. They went to He's private residence to rest. The crowds along the way were shoulder to shoulder, cheering. The situation was extremely enthusiastic. Chiang rested for a while and then received important officials from the party, government, and military circles separately, inquiring briefly. At 5:00 PM, various sectors of the party, government, and military held a banquet at the public club. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Guiyang) At 9:00 AM on the 27th, the provincial party headquarters held an enlarged memorial week. All department heads of the party headquarters and above, military officers with the rank of major or above, political officers with the rank of section chief or above, all members of the county training institutes, and gentry from all provinces participated. Chairman Chiang presided. After the ceremony, Chiang gave a speech, which is recorded in full below: Representatives of the party, government, military, and academic circles of Guizhou, and gentry from all walks of life. Since I left Guizhou last year, it has been a year. Because I am busy, I cannot often talk to you. This time I came to Guizhou, and I deeply feel that all undertakings have made progress, especially the anti-smoking efforts have achieved results. The province lacks production, and the locality is barren. Only by banning opium, developing resources, and striving for production and construction can we find a way out. I have silently observed that all sectors of the public have thoroughly understood the anti-smoking efforts, which is the biggest progress in this province. Highway construction is developing day by day, and the economy of this province can be expected to prosper. Bandits can gradually be completely suppressed. News can reach this province on the same day. The cultural level can also be improved, which is the biggest success of this province. For the above two points, I still hope that the party, government, military, academic circles, and gentry of this province will make efforts to publicize and promote them so that the public can understand the urgency of eradicating opium and the need to actively assist in road construction, and to cooperate effectively with the government to achieve success. Whether it is social education or school education or various training courses, the education in this province must be practical and not just empty talk. The purpose of education is to make people understand etiquette, justice, integrity, and shame. If you do not understand etiquette, justice, integrity, and shame, it is equivalent to not being educated. Etiquette is the head of the four dimensions, and attention must be paid to proper and solemn etiquette. In this way, modern citizens can be cultivated and a modern country can be created. The pacification work in this province should focus on organizing baojia and registering civilian guns, which can be completed within a few months. All undertakings require the efforts of the government, especially the cooperation of the people. The intellectuals of this province all understand this meaning, lead the people, and assist the government to complete the mission of building a new Guizhou. When I come to this province again in the future, there will definitely be great progress. After the speech, the ceremony was completed, and he immediately went with Qian Dajun and others to the Qingzhen Airport. Liu Xing, Cao Jingyuan, Guo Siyan, Hao Mengling, Wan Yaohuang and other hundred people accompanied him to see him off. At 11:10 AM, the car arrived at the airport and rested in the office. At 11:50 AM, he took off to Changsha. German advisor Shi Danas remained in Guiyang. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Wang Telegraphs Hu from Germany, Reporting That the Bullet Has Been Removed</h3>

<h3>Chongqing and Chengdu Earthquakes</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) An earthquake occurred in Chongqing City at 7:00 AM on the 27th. The initial shock was very strong, and the doors, windows, and glass moved. It subsided after 20 seconds and stopped after about a minute. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 27th)</p>

The first shock lasted for several seconds, and the houses tilted significantly. Fortunately, it did not cause a disaster. This is the third earthquake in Chengdu this year, and the tremor was the strongest this time. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Chiang's Anti-Smoking Director-General Issues Order: If Poppy Seedlings are Found in Prohibited Planting Areas, Excuses for Avoiding Responsibility Will Not Be Tolerated; Regardless of the Number of Stems, Criminal Penalties Will Be Imposed According to Law, and All Cases Will Be Transferred to Military Law Agencies, Which Cannot Handle Them Vaguely</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Director-General Chiang issued a telegraphic order to all provinces and cities and special anti-opium planting envoys, stating that those who make excuses to evade planting opium will be punished according to law. The original telegram stated: It is checked that illegal opium planting should be punished according to law, and recently, it has been reported from various provinces that a small number of poppy seedlings have been found. The local Baojia attribute it to wild seeds left behind and not deliberately planted, blaming the source of the disaster on the fact that the poppy seeds were not destroyed in the past. Although opium planting has been banned, many opium seeds still remain. In addition, announcements and propaganda have not been earnest, widespread, and deeply rooted in people's hearts, or they are deliberately planted and disguised as wild, or they try and are not afraid of warnings. Even if it is really a wild variety, they fail to eliminate it themselves after it emerges from the soil, and they make excuses to avoid responsibility only after it is discovered. Once this is started, the prohibition of planting will only become a formality, and the heavy penalty will be tantamount to a fake. It is urgent to restrict it by telegram. If opium seedlings are found in the prohibited planting area in the future, in addition to being immediately eradicated, regardless of the number of stems, they should be punished according to the third article of the Interim Regulations on Anti-Smoking Criminal Penalties. Even if there are circumstances that can be forgiven, they can only be reduced according to the circumstances in accordance with Article 20 of the general criminal law. All cases must be handed over to military law agencies for trial, and vague treatment cannot be used. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>New Customs Anti-Smuggling Measures Implemented in North China; Customs Offers High Prices to Buy Informants and Reduce Tax Rates on Artificial Silk, etc.; Ross Summons British Merchants to Inquire About Recent Smuggling Situation</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The new customs anti-smuggling measures in North China were implemented on the 27th, with the Tianjin Customs, Beining, Jinpu, and Pinghan agencies as the main bodies. Tax checkpoints have been set up in Cangxian, Changxindian, Tianjin suburbs, and Xiaozhakou to strictly crack down on smuggled goods transferred by water and land, and more than 100 informants have been hired. The customs also auctioned off confiscated sugar and artificial silk at low prices, causing the prices of stocks held by Japanese to be in disarray. (Special Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The price of artificial silk and sugar smuggled in Tianjin has plummeted due to the strict anti-smuggling measures implemented by the Customs starting on the 27th. Artificial silk is selling for 92 yuan per package, down 25 yuan, and sugar is 18.5 yuan per bag, down 2.5 yuan. It is reported that the sales markets in Gaoyang, Lu Zhoucun, Hebei, are crowded. A certain concession has a stockpile of 800,000 pieces of artificial silk and 1.6 million bags of sugar. In order to dump the goods, the Japanese are renting long-distance buses to sell to Shaanxi and Gansu. (Special Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to Tianjin Customs sources, the Customs is now offering high prices to buy informants to crack down on smuggling, which has proven effective. However, it is still hoped that the second step of anti-smuggling effective measures will be promulgated by the Ministry. The Customs Anti-Smuggling Division has cracked several smuggling cases every day. The Tianjin-Qinhuangdao Customs has suffered too much damage due to the impact of smuggling on tax revenue and the recent silver price in gold units. The tariff revenue for this year is expected to decrease by at least 40% compared to last year's 40 million. (Special Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Ross summoned British merchants residing in Tianjin on the 27th to inquire about the British economic situation and smuggling in North China. In the afternoon, he met with Xu Liya, the Chief Commissioner of the Tianjin Customs, for a long talk. (Special Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to Customs sources, the second step of the new anti-smuggling measures in North China may be promulgated in one day. The tax rates for artificial silk, sugar, and cloth will be reduced to 60%. The tax on each piece of artificial silk will be reduced from 120 gold units to 48 gold units, and the tax on each bag of sugar will be reduced from 96 gold units to 38 gold units. After the promulgation, the smuggled goods will add transportation costs, and those transferred from Hebei-East to Tianjin-Pukou and Pinghan roads will have no profit to be made, which will inevitably cut them off. (Special Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Intermodal Transportation Procedures for Goods Inside and Outside Customs Announced</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Beining Railway announced the intermodal transportation reporting procedures for goods inside and outside the Customs on the 27th.

<p>(Taiyuan) About 300 remnant bandits gathered in the area of Jijiagou, Hongyaocun, and Yushe Village in Shilu. They have very few guns and bullets and come out at night to rob and rape. The people call the bandits Black Bandits. There is one pseudo-division commander among the bandits. After our army's strict search and suppression, they have fled and dispersed. The entire Fourth Division of the bandit pseudo-First Army Corps sneaked into Diaojiayu and other places west of Sangbizhen in Yonghe on the 25th. Our army fought fiercely with them for two hours, and the bandits suffered heavy casualties and then collapsed. Our army is now attacking the bandits together. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Mao Jizhai, the Administrative Commissioner of Northern Shaanxi, arrived in Peiping this afternoon and said that he had met with Yan in Taiyuan. The method of joint defense between Shanxi and Shaanxi has been roughly discussed and has begun to take shape. The military progress in suppressing bandits in northern Shaanxi is very rapid.

<h3>Villagers in Wuxian County Clash with Security Team; Public Security Bureau Chief Rushes to Persuade; County Government Decides to Collect Rent by District</h3>
<p>(Suzhou) On the morning of the 27th, a number of villagers from Liantong Township, Xiatang area, about four miles away from Xietang Town, suddenly planned to go to Xietang Town. The security team of the town heard the news and rushed to stop them. The villagers refused to obey and clashed with the security team. By noon, the number of villagers had increased to more than a thousand. The security team was outnumbered and retreated to Fengyi area near Jinbo. However, the villagers continued to advance. The security team fired into the air to show their power, but the villagers still did not retreat and continued to advance. When they rushed to Huimin Bridge in Xietang Town, Zhang Hanwei, director of the Suzhou Public Security Bureau, and Nie Dezhao, captain of the security team, also rushed to the scene after receiving the report. They summoned the Baojia chiefs at the town office of Xietang Town to inquire about the villagers' intention to gather in the town and the organization of the villagers. However, the villagers only said that they requested the release of the three people who were previously detained and had no other intentions. After Zhang and Nie persuaded them and explained that the three detainees had been released on bail, the villagers gradually dispersed. (Special Dispatch, 21st and 7th)</p>
<p>(Suzhou) At about 8:00 AM on the 27th, hundreds of villagers gathered in Fengyu Village, Chefang Town, near Xietang Town.

At that time, when the security team was surrounded, they fired into the air. A stray bullet hit a Wu woman villager in the thigh, and she was sent to the Suzhou County Hospital for treatment in the afternoon. The injury was not fatal, so there was no danger to her life. (Special Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Suzhou) Deng Xianghai, the county magistrate of Wuxian County, issued a statement, stating that if the villagers are unable to pay the rent, they can discuss it through legal procedures.

<h3>The Current Stage of the US Presidential Election</h3>
<p>— Star</p>
<p>The two major parties in the United States, the Republican and Democratic parties, will convene national conventions in June this year to elect candidates for this year's presidential election. In recent days, competition has been fierce in various states to elect representatives to attend the party conventions. Not only have the leaders of the two parties made grand speeches and attacked each other, but even members of the same party have slandered each other in the competition for the presidential candidate seat. It is a custom in the United States that anyone who wants to seek the position of president in a general election must first obtain the support of the representatives in the party convention. To win in the party convention, it is necessary to be active when electing representatives in each state. Therefore, Roosevelt, Bora and others have been running around to gain the favor of the people. The success or failure of the primary election is absolutely related to the success or failure of the general election.</p>
<p>As far as the Democratic Party is concerned, there is no doubt that the next convention will nominate Roosevelt as a candidate. According to past habits, any president who has completed his first term must be the candidate of the party for re-election. This habit has not changed for decades. Although there are many anti-Roosevelt factions in the Democratic Party, they have no recognized leader since Senator Hiran was assassinated. Therefore, Roosevelt can rest easy with Hiran's death. As for the Republican Party, there is no leader who is unanimously supported. Currently, the most vocal candidates are Senator Bora, Kansas Governor Landon, and Chicago News Evening Post publisher Knox. It is impossible to predict who will win.</p>
<p>Who will win the Republican trophy is a very interesting issue in this year's US election. As far as the three most vocal candidates are concerned, Bora's ideology is the most progressive and he is not used by capitalists. His attack on the New Deal comes purely from the standpoint of the petty bourgeoisie and the peasantry. His opposition to the big trusts and the wealthy is no less than that of Roosevelt. However, he advocates free competition, individualism, and the traditional separation of powers, state rights, and civil rights. Although his ideology is relatively backward, he is still a person who supports the interests of the common people. Landon is a newcomer in the political world. He has a good reputation in Kansas. Balancing the budget and reducing taxes are welcomed by the propertied class. He is cautious and conservative, similar to former President Coolidge. Coolidge is the most popular figure in the American business community. As for Knox, as a businessman, his newspaper relies on advertisements for life and breathes with the financial and business circles without any doubt.</p>
<p>If Bora unfortunately fails, the Republican Party will become a tool for the bourgeoisie. If the Republican Party wins the election in November and Landon, Knox, and others are in the White House, the United States will return to the state before 1932. The banks of New York will regain control of Washington. It is worrying that Bora is isolated and weak, with no financial power or influence as a backing. However, if Bora fails, the Republican Party's hope of victory will also be slim.</p>
<h3>Distribution of National Assembly Representative Quotas; Five Committees of the Legislative Yuan Will Retain the First Draft of the Two Laws, Complete Part of the Draft and Submit it to the 24-Member Committee for Discussion at a Meeting Tomorrow; The Number of Representatives from Northeast China Has Been Increased in Proportion to the Population</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The five committees of the Legislative Yuan's 24-member committee that were appointed to draft the first drafts of the two National Assembly laws met at the Legislative Yuan on the afternoon of the 27th. They have revised the principles and resolutions of the Electoral Law for National Assembly Representatives based on the principles issued by the Central Committee, and have completed all of the reserved articles and appendices of the first draft of the law related to the distribution of representative quotas. The completed draft will be submitted to the 24-member committee for discussion at the fourth meeting on the 29th to conclude all of the drafting work on the two National Assembly laws. Regarding the issue of representative quotas, except for the regional elections, which have been readjusted due to the combined distribution of representatives from Northeast China, the number of representatives to be produced by the remaining professional, military, overseas Chinese, Mongolian and Tibetan, and various elections are largely the same as those previously planned. The original number of representatives to be produced by regional elections was 687, plus the original number of 23 representatives from Northeast China, for a total of 710. It is not yet known how many representatives from Northeast China will occupy in it, but it is heard that the distribution of representatives from Northeast China is based on the principle of population proportion and is appropriately stipulated with reference to the current situation. The number of people has naturally increased. As a result, the number of representatives from each province and city in the original regional elections has also changed slightly. This change has been made after careful research and the original number of representatives from each province and city has been reduced on average, so that no province or city feels unfair.

<h3>Two Central Memorial Weeks: Yu Youren Reports on How to Enter Constitutional Government, Chairman Lin of the National Government Speaks on Saving the Nation with Integrity</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Committee held its 21st memorial week at 9:00 AM on the 27th. Attendees included Central Committee members Ye Chucang, Feng Yuxiang, Lin Sen, Ju Zheng, Yu Youren, Zhang Ji, He Yingqin, Zhou Qigang, Fang Zhi, Zhu Peide, Zhang Qun, Zhou Fo Hai, Jiang Zuobin, Gu Zhenglun, Yu Feipeng, Jing Hengyi, Cheng Qian, Deng Jiayan, Zhang Zhen, and all staff members, totaling over 700 people. After leading the ceremony, Chairman Yu Youren gave an impromptu report on "How to Enter Constitutional Government," stating briefly that the draft constitution was about to be announced and constitutional government would begin. He said that this was not a release of responsibility for our comrades, but rather an increase in responsibility. During the period of military and political rule, force was sufficient, but constitutional government is the founding period of the country. If we do not have precise research, we cannot lead the people. We understand the Premier's teachings on the ways and procedures of building and governing the country with the Three Principles of the People, which not only pave the way for a world of great harmony for China, but also for the whole world. Consolidating and utilizing revolutionary power and realizing the facilities for nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood are our lifelong responsibilities, and only then can we lead the people. The Constitution is a life-saving soup for China to rise from the dead, and the beginning of constitutional government is related to the century-old plan of the country, the historical mission of this party, the revolutionary cause entrusted by the Premier, and the focus of the world. Therefore, the relationship between the Three Principles of the People and the Constitution is very important and can be divided into two aspects: First, the establishment of the Three Principles of the People means that during the constitutional period, no other ideologies or regimes are allowed to exist within the Three Principles of the People state. Second, the relationship between the party and politics is determined. This party is for the genuine birth of the Constitution. Before the revolution of the Three Principles of the People has succeeded, we are only implementing the ideology into the Constitution. This party must also shoulder the future responsibility of building the country under the Constitution. The beginning of constitutional government is to remedy and improve the shortcomings of past military and political training periods in the constitutional period. I hope everyone will work together with one heart and one mind with the people of the whole country to relieve the national crisis. After Yu's speech, the meeting adjourned. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held a memorial week at 10:00 AM on the 27th. Attendees included Feng Yuxiang, Yu Youren, Zhang Ji, Jing Hengyi, Deng Jiayan, Cheng Qian, Chen Shaokuan, Huang Musong, Chen Shuren, Chen Xunyong, Lv Chao, Wei Huai, and staff members from the National Government and various Yuan, Ministries, and Commissions, totaling over 500 people. After Chairman Lin led the ceremony, he gave an impromptu speech on "Saving the Nation with Integrity" until 10:30 AM. After the speech, the ceremony concluded and the meeting adjourned. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Lin spoke on "Saving the Nation with Integrity" at the National Government's memorial week on the morning of the 27th. He first said that in today's difficult national situation, it is especially important to talk about integrity. "The head can be cut off, the body can be killed, but the will cannot be bent." Only when everyone can hold such aspirations can the current crisis be saved, and only then will the revival of the nation be guaranteed. Because everyone knows to respect integrity, the national spirit will be aroused. Once the spirit is stirred up, danger can naturally be sustained, collapse can be supported, decline can be revived, and weakness can be strengthened. Secondly, he said that only those who can practice filial piety, brotherly love, loyalty, trustworthiness, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, and who cannot be corrupted by wealth and honor, moved by poverty and lowliness, or subdued by power and force, can be called people of integrity. The poverty and weakness of a country are not a concern, but the lack of integrity of the people is the greatest concern. Because the country is based on the people, and the people are based on the heart. If the people's hearts are dead and they regard the survival of the country as a matter of indifference, then the foundation of the country is shaken. If the foundation of the country is shaken, how can the country exist, and how can the nation have any hope of revival? Thirdly, he said that the more chaotic and dangerous the times, the more we must respect integrity and adhere to the cultivation of integrity. The most important and noteworthy points are "do not seek improper gain in the face of wealth, and do not evade danger in the face of disaster." Not seeking improper gain and not evading danger is to preserve our integrity, and only then can the country and nation have a way out. Finally, he said that at a time when internal and external troubles are pressing each other, saving the nation and seeking survival certainly requires efforts to consolidate national defense, but the fundamental plan is still to respect integrity and practice loyalty and righteousness. Because those who have no integrity and no loyalty and righteousness must be selfish, self-interested, seeking improper gain and evading danger. They do not have the concept of the country and the nation. Therefore, this city has specifically put forward the topic of "Saving the Nation and Seeking Survival Should Respect Integrity," which is in line with the Premier's legacy of saving the nation with integrity. I hope that the whole country, from top to bottom, will encourage each other. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<h3>Sun Ke Prepares to Propose a Plan for Rural Revitalization</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke has decided to propose a plan for rural revitalization to the Central Government. The content is divided into two parts: First, unifying and adjusting the cooperative system; second, agricultural lending. He appointed legislators Lou Tongsun and Yao Chuanfa to study the cooperative part, and Chen Changheng, Wei Tingsheng, etc. to study the lending part. Secretary-General Liang Hancao, as well as Wu Jingxiong, Wu Shangying, Ma Yinchu, Fu Bingchang, and He Sui, the heads of the five committees on legal system, economics, finance, foreign affairs, and military affairs, participated in the research and held three meetings. A preliminary draft was agreed upon. Another meeting will be held at 2:00 PM on the 29th to create a complete plan for the cooperative system and lending methods, which will be submitted to the Central Political Council next week. According to Lou Tongsun, the adjustment of the cooperative system is currently being drafted. In addition to the current situation of cooperatives, it is felt that they are too scattered, the procedures for handling agricultural loans are mostly slow, and the organization is not very sound, so the cooperative business is almost losing development. The nature of agricultural products has become something that is handled because of loans, which should be corrected as soon as possible to establish a systematic cooperative organization. The current investment in rural areas by various banks has revealed that when farmers are unable to redeem agricultural products due to mortgaged warehouses, the farmers suffer a lot of losses. Therefore, although the current investment in rural areas by various banks takes advantage of slightly lower interest rates than ordinary loans, the results are not entirely satisfactory. The nature of cooperatives is to seek autonomy. The current result of separate investment by banks has created a capital nature. Even if this is regarded as a lending institution, it must be handled uniformly by the central government, otherwise there will be no drawbacks. The Cooperative Law has been promulgated, and the current lending situation cannot be restricted by law. Attention must now be paid to the unity of action to ensure that farmers receive tangible benefits. According to Chen Changheng, the lending method is currently under study and has not yet been concretized. Because of the current desolation of the countryside, President Sun hopes to revitalize the rural economy with greater force. He is currently planning to improve the existing rural cooperatives on the one hand, and to adjust the future rural economy on the other. The Chinese farmers account for 75% to 80% of the national population, and their relationship with the soundness of the entire national economic system is very large. In addition to the improvement of cooperative societies studied this time, which is studied by the two members Yao Chuanfa and Lou Tongsun, the issue of increasing the circulation of rural funds is also being studied. 1. The government allocates funds to establish a national cooperative bank. 2. Or the current Chinese Farmers Bank will be expanded. It is hoped that the Central Bank and other commercial banks will jointly assist, and the central government will uniformly handle rural loans. The Agricultural and Commercial Bureau, which is currently being planned by the Ministry of Industry, has a total capital of 30 million yuan, and 6 million yuan is used for lending each year. The plan is also very large, and it would be quite appropriate to expand the Agricultural and Commercial Bureau in the future. Currently, it is planned to conduct investigations with the Ministry of Industry's Economic and Financial Committee, the Cooperative Enterprise Committee, and other cooperative agencies for research, and then decide on the method. In the future, after the case is submitted to the Central Government for decision, the adjustment of cooperative societies and lending will still be handled jointly by the Ministry of Finance and Industry.

<h3>French Chamber of Deputies Re-election: Results of the First Round of Voting Revealed</h3>
<p>Right-Wing Parties Slightly Advantageous, Left-Wing Parties May Win in Second Round of Voting</p>
<p>(Paris) This re-election of the Chamber of Deputies involved a total of 618 electoral districts, with 618 deputies to be elected. As of 5:15 AM today, the results of 611 districts have been revealed. Among them, a total of 179 seats have been confirmed as winners with more than the required number of votes. The remaining 432 seats will have to wait until the second round of voting on Sunday, May 3, to determine the winners. The list of the 179 elected officials is as follows:</p>
<p>Parties Belonging to the Left-Wing Popular Front: 62 Seats</p>
<p>(A) Communist Party: 10 Seats (B) Orthodox Socialist Party: 23 Seats (C) Republican Socialist Alliance Party: 5 Seats (D) Independent Socialist Party: 3 Seats (E) Radical Socialist Party: 21 Seats</p>
<p>Central Parties: 50 Seats</p>
<p>(A) Independent Radical Party: 19 Seats (B) Left-Wing Republican Party: 23 Seats (C) Popular Democratic Party: 8 Seats</p>
<p>Parties Belonging to the Right-Wing National Front: 67 Seats</p>
<p>(A) Republican Democratic Alliance Party: 57 Seats (B) Independent Republican Party: 10 Seats</p>
<p>(Paris) The results of yesterday's re-election of the Chamber of Deputies show that as many as 432 out of 611 seats require a second round of voting due to the lack of a majority. This number has never been seen before in previous elections. In addition to former Prime Minister Herriot and current Minister of Education Guenot, Chamber of Deputies Speaker Bouisson (Orthodox Socialist Party) and current Minister of Aviation Théo (Republican Socialist Alliance Party) were also not elected. According to past practice, the composition of the new Chamber of Deputies can be seen from the results of the first round of voting. In this election, the right wing has a slight advantage in the first round of voting. Therefore, the situation in the second round of voting will depend on whether the parties belonging to the left-wing Popular Front can fully implement the agreed agreement. (According to this agreement, the parties belonging to the Front have mutually agreed that once the first round of voting is completed, and it is found out which party has received the most votes, that party's candidates will be elected in the second round of voting in order to win the final victory.) In addition, the election process yesterday can be described as peaceful. In some electoral districts, voters have abstained for purely local reasons. Apart from this, voters across the country have enthusiastically participated in the voting. Therefore, the abstention rate will be lower than in 1932. It is said that the French people's support for the parliamentary system and their loyalty to the republican system can be seen from this. (Havas dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<h3>Features of This Election: Great Victory for the Communist Party, Increase of 500,000 Votes Compared to Before</h3>
<p>(Paris) The characteristic of yesterday's French election was the unexpected victory of the Communist Party. The number of votes obtained by the Communist Party this time was 500,000 more than in 1932. It is estimated that it can win 45 seats in the new Chamber of Deputies, rather than the expected 30 seats. What it has gained is mostly what the Socialist Party has lost, while the Socialist Party has a tendency to seize the seats of the Radical Party. The Communist Party is particularly strong in Paris and the northern industrial areas. (Reuters dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Although the results of this re-election of the Chamber of Deputies have not been fully revealed, the Communist Party has made significant progress in the suburbs of Paris and the northern industrial areas. This is most noteworthy. In the current Chamber of Deputies (elected in 1932), the Communist Party only occupies 10 seats. According to observers familiar with the political situation, the results of the election should increase the number of seats occupied by the party to around 30. As for other socialist parties (such as the Orthodox Socialist Party and the Republican Socialist Alliance Party, etc.), they can win around 140 seats, which is about the same as the current Chamber of Deputies. The Radical Socialist Party, which has 160 seats in the current Chamber of Deputies, is the most dominant. According to the prediction of the party's most senior members, the result of this election may reduce the number of seats by about 20, leaving only about 145 seats. Although it is inferior compared to before, it can still occupy the most seats in the new Chamber of Deputies. In total, the left-wing Popular Front can occupy about 315 seats out of 618 seats. As for the right-wing parties, although their position in Paris is very solid, the number of seats of the right-wing and central parties may not have any significant increase or decrease. (Havas dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) It is generally expected that the situation of the second round of voting next Sunday will be favorable to the left-wing Popular Front, and the Communist Party, in particular, will win a great victory due to its advocacy of patriotism. (Reuters dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The first round of voting for the re-election of the Chamber of Deputies was held today. As of 11:00 PM, no riots had occurred in the city. The rain stopped in the evening. Citizens gathered in front of newspapers and polling stations to wait for news. The newspapers either reported the election results through loudspeakers or displayed them in large letters at the entrance. Citizens were eager to see them first. Political figures, on the other hand, were talking loudly in clubs or cafes, all speculating on the organization of the next Chamber of Deputies based on the results of the first round of voting.

<h3>Unprecedented in French History: Herriot Actually Loses Election, Says He Will Withdraw from Politics</h3>
<p>(Paris) The election of 618 deputies from 4,814 candidates yesterday has passed peacefully without any unexpected incidents. The most unexpected thing was that Herriot did not get an absolute majority in the election in Lyon and will have to go through a second round of voting on May 3. It is now known that the important figures who have been elected include Foreign Minister Flandin and Prime Minister Daladier. (Reuters)</p>
<p>(Paris) Among the elected members, there are six current cabinet members, namely Foreign Minister Flandin, Minister of Pensions Pees, Minister of Commerce Pomaret, Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Mandel, Minister of Agriculture Delelier, and Minister of Labor Frossard. Important figures of the Popular Front, such as Communist Party leader Dores, Orthodox Socialist Party leader Olivar, Radical Socialist Party leader and former Prime Minister Daladier, and Republican Democratic Alliance Party leader and former Minister without Portfolio Maran, have also been elected. It is estimated that there are more than 200 people who did not get a majority of the votes in the first round of voting and will have to go through a second round of voting, among which the former Radical Socialist Party leader Herriot and former Minister of Finance Renault are the most important. It is unprecedented in the history of French elections that Herriot, with the qualifications of a former prime minister, was not elected in the first round of voting. However, according to the agreement reached in advance by the parties of the left-wing Popular Front, the Communist Party and the Socialist Party will elect Herriot in the second round of voting, so Herriot's election is not a problem. Renault is running for election with the qualification of a right-leaning central party elector. In terms of finance, he strongly advocates the devaluation of the franc, and in terms of diplomacy, he strongly supports the Franco-Russian mutual assistance pact, so he is opposed by the right-wing parties. (Havas)</p>
<p>(Paris) After receiving the report that Radical Party leader Herriot did not get an absolute majority in the primary election, it is said that he has declared that he now intends to withdraw from politics and will no longer be a candidate for the second election. The British and French electoral systems are different. In Britain, the one who gets the most votes is elected. In France, only the champion who gets an absolute majority is qualified, otherwise there must be a re-election. (Reuters dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the results of the first round of voting in the Chamber of Deputies election were revealed, the stock market has already reacted badly. Government bonds and Banque de France shares fell sharply at the opening. Shares of other banks and chemical and electrical companies also fell across the board. Banque de France shares fell by about 400 points, bonds fell by 1.5 points, Electricité de France (France's largest electrical company) shares fell by 85 points, and Creusot armaments factory shares fell by 87 points.

<h3>10,000 Italian Troops on the Northern Front Depart from Tais, Advancing on Adigrat; Supply Columns and Military Vehicles Form a Continuous Stream, Expected to Reach Their Destination in Two Weeks</h3>
<p>(Rome) According to well-informed sources here, the Italian troops on the northern front in Abyssinia, currently concentrated in the city of Tais, are scheduled to begin their southward advance today, with the hope of capturing the Abyssinian capital as soon as possible. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Asmara: Loaded vehicles transporting military supplies and food are continuously moving on the road from Tais to Adigrat. Soldiers and Italian troops have also begun to depart, with the force advancing on Adigrat said to be over 10,000 strong. Military authorities estimate that the Italian troops can reach Adigrat in two weeks. Engineering teams are at the forefront of the Italian forces, specializing in road repairs. The speed of the Italian advance is quite astonishing. By Sunday evening, the Italian troops had already marched a quarter of the entire route. (National News Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Asmara: The Italian military headquarters in Tais is currently preparing to attack the Abyssinian capital. The First Group of National Troops, Native Troops, and the Air Force are all gathering near Tais. On the road from Maigale to Tais, transport vehicles are seen continuously. The road, which was previously a narrow path, has now been widened into a motor road. Cargo ships carrying 3,000 tons of various military equipment and food have arrived in Tais, awaiting orders to go to the front line at Adigrat. The weather south of Tais is quite favorable. Regarding the whereabouts of the Abyssinian Emperor, there is currently no confirmed news. (National News Agency dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Tais: Italian troops are preparing for a general offensive on Harar, Jijiga, and Adigrat today. General Graziani's troops on the southern front have engaged in final defensive clashes with General Nasibu's forces today. Graziani himself has admitted that eleven Caucasian officers have been killed and seventeen wounded in the past two days. Abyssinian troop losses are also heavy. Unofficial reports claim that Italian troops have already occupied Sassabaneh. (National News Agency dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to a telegram from General Badoglio, commander-in-chief of the Italian forces in East Africa, it has been confirmed that Italian troops on the southern front launched a surprise attack and occupied Daggah Bur on April 23rd, but were repelled by a fierce counterattack from enemy forces at Daggah Bur. On the same day, the central column, which included soldiers who had defected from overseas, attacked the enemy's positions at Hamenlei, engaging in combat throughout the day. At dawn on the 25th, Italian troops charged with bayonets, driving out the enemy soldiers from the mountain caves in the Fafan River valley and occupying Hamenlei. At the same time, the troops defending the trenches at the Ganakager position on the right flank were annihilated by Italian forces, and the stronghold was also captured. Italian forces then advanced north in victory. The Italian losses, including those of the Eritrean troops, amounted to over 700 killed and wounded. It is reported that the Abyssinian forces suffered over 1,000 casualties in Hamenlei alone. The battlefield is lined with a triangular, fortified defense line, connecting the three towns of Daggah Bur, Sassabaneh, and Daggah Bur, blocking the main road to Harar. The goal of this Italian offensive is Harar. The area consists of treacherous and barren rocky mountains, dense thickets, and rapid streams flowing from the mountains into the valleys, often causing floods. General Nasibu, with the assistance of Turkish General Wehib Bey, constructed a trench line equipped with machine gun nests, attempting to impede General Graziani's advance. However, the bombs dropped by Italian aircraft were accurate and devastating, forcing the enemy troops to retreat from the mountain caves they had occupied. General Nasibu then launched a dense, Abyssinian-style attack, which was ultimately defeated by the Italian forces. The Italian mechanized forces are pursuing the retreating enemy towards Daggah Bur. The Italian communication line, starting from Mogadishu in the west, is approximately 500 miles long, so it is necessary to build roads and railways, and construct bridges over the rivers. According to authorities, if the fall of Sassabaneh is confirmed, then Italian forces will be able to control the entire communication line and open the path to Harar. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Adigrat: This morning, Italian aircraft flew over Adigrat, dropping leaflets stating that if the residents do not surrender, they will be slaughtered and their houses destroyed. If they surrender, the Abyssinian people will benefit, because the Italians will bring commercial prosperity and civilization to Abyssinia. This leaflet was printed in the Abyssinian language and signed by General Badoglio, commander-in-chief of the Italian forces in East Africa, who stated that Italian forces have already occupied the entire northern region of Abyssinia and the Ogaden region, and will soon enter Adigrat with God's help. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Adigrat: Today, an Italian three-engine aircraft circled overhead, dropping leaflets in the Abyssinian language, stating that Italian forces have achieved great victories on both the northern and southern fronts. You need not destroy the roads or resist any further, otherwise we will annihilate you. (National News Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Adigrat: Princess Tsehai, the Emperor's daughter, who is only seventeen years old, recently gave an interview to foreign journalists, asking them to appeal on her behalf to "women all over the world," stating that "Italian troops are committing atrocities in our country and using poison gas. If people all over the world turn a blind eye to this, then all of civilization will be destroyed. I hope that you will speak out for justice and repeatedly request influential figures in your countries to take effective action as soon as possible. If you can urge them, then your governments will be able to instruct their ambassadors to Italy to express their unanimous disgust at the Italian troops' atrocities and to request the League of Nations to force Italy to destroy all of its stockpiles of gas in East Africa. The eighteen-nation committee (responsible for discussing sanctions) must also be ordered to immediately prohibit the shipment of military equipment to Italy and to blockade the sea routes, in order to prevent the Italian troops from going to East Africa."

<h3>Calls for Reforming the League of Nations; Differing Theories on Reform Attract Great Attention from Smaller Nations</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Now that the League of Nations has failed to prevent the Italo-Abyssinian War, the issue of reforming the League of Nations has arisen. Many people, citing Germany's unwillingness to assume the obligation to participate in sanctions against aggressor nations, advocate abolishing Article 16 of the Covenant regarding sanctions. At the same time, others advocate making Article 16 of the Covenant even more powerful, so that aggressor nations can no longer maintain friendly relations with nations imposing sanctions, as Italy has done. Still others advocate establishing regional agreements that include defined obligations to supplement general agreements and to serve as a support for the League of Nations. It is reported that smaller nations are now observing the situation with great attention. Although they acknowledge the League of Nations' failure in Abyssinia, they fear that any new reform may increase the danger to weaker nations. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Former British Foreign Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare to be Appointed First Lord of the Admiralty; Baldwin Asks Hoare to Return to the Cabinet</h3>
<p>(London) The Morning Post once reported that the current First Lord of the Admiralty, Sir Bolton Eyres-Monsell, is about to resign his position, and the vacancy will be filled by former Foreign Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare. However, Conservative Party members say that this is premature, because although Eyres-Monsell will not hold the position of First Lord of the Admiralty for much longer, he will not be leaving political life. As for Hoare succeeding as First Lord of the Admiralty, this may be possible in the future. At present, British public opinion is still largely opposed to his joining the cabinet, and it is difficult for this to become a reality in the short term. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>

<p>(Vienna) Vice-Chancellor Starhemberg today gave a speech to 15,000 members of the armed Home Guard in Lower Austria, issuing a grave warning, saying that only those with political shortsightedness and foolishness would hope for the Home Guard's disarmament, and this would not happen until his death. Chancellor Schuschnigg is now able to rely on the loyalty of the Home Guard, but he (Starhemberg) must use this group to resist his so-called friends, otherwise he will be in danger of strangulation and exclusion. Starhemberg's remarks were in response to the efforts of several cabinet members to disband the Home Guard. There have been recent rumors that the Home Guard and Hitler have reached an agreement to implement a coup or restore the Habsburg monarchy, but in light of today's events, this is not credible. Vienna is now calm, and the police and military command deny the existence of any "state of alert." (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) Vice-President and Commander of the Home Guard, Prince Starhemberg, today announced a purge movement to cope with the national crisis in Hohenberg, and after holding several secret meetings beforehand, decided to demand the dismissal of all government advisors who oppose the Home Guard tomorrow. Starhemberg's speech today also criticized military officers who oppose the Home Guard, saying that some people hope to introduce the corrupt spirit of the old political parties into the new nation, which we consider a challenge. Starhemberg also reiterated his loyalty to Chancellor Schuschnigg. At the same time, it is widely rumored in diplomatic circles here that after German leader Hitler assured the Austrian Chancellor that Germany is willing to respect Austria's borders and will avoid interfering in Austria's internal affairs, Germany and Austria are about to reach a compromise. (National News Agency dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) Patriotic organizations recently held a demonstration in Baden. Chancellor Schuschnigg attended and gave a speech, stating that "At a time when there are serious international disputes, it is fortunate that Austria has not been caught in the whirlpool. However, the situation in Austria is not something to be too optimistic about. Some people are planning a general attack on the nation's fundamental system. Fortunately, we are already prepared and can cope with it with ease." He concluded by saying that we must now follow in the footsteps of the late Chancellor Dollfuss and implement a policy of authority. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Spanish Presidential Election: Azaña Expected to be Elected; Leftist Electoral Representatives Win Majority</h3>
<p>Madrid: Spain is scheduled to elect a new president on May 10. Prime Minister Azaña is expected to be elected, but it is still doubtful whether the Left Republican Party to which he belongs will allow him to resign as Prime Minister and become a presidential candidate. It is reported that many party members have stated that if Azaña resigns as Prime Minister, they will not participate in politics. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Madrid: According to the Spanish Constitution, the President is elected jointly by members of the Congress of Deputies and an equal number of electoral representatives. After the resignation of former President Zamora, the government scheduled a national election of these representatives this month, so that on May 10th, they can join the members of the Congress of Deputies in electing his successor. The election in the capital today went very smoothly, and no incidents occurred in the provinces. However, only half of the eligible voters in the capital participated in the election, and the number of abstentions was even higher in the provinces. In some electoral districts, the only candidates nominated were from the leftist Popular Front. It is generally believed that the outcome of this election will be a victory for the left, which will be the same as the outcome of the congressional elections in February. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Madrid: The 473 national electoral representatives were elected by voters yesterday. As of now, the results have been announced for 317 of them, of which 259 belong to the leftist Popular Front and 62 belong to other parties. These electoral representatives will join the members of the Congress of Deputies in electing the successor president on May 10th. It is rumored that the parties belonging to the Popular Front are now planning to nominate the well-known jurist, former President of the Constitutional Court, Albornoz, as a candidate for the presidential election. It is not yet known whether this news is true, and even if it is, there may still be changes. The current Prime Minister, Azaña, was originally the leader of the Left Republican Party and has high qualifications, but he is not expected to be nominated for the presidency, because both the Socialist Party and the Left Republican Party want him to continue serving as Prime Minister.

<h3>London Times Comments on Russo-Japanese Relations: Japan Still Plans to Increase Troops in Manchuria</h3>
<p>(London) The Times commented today on the frequent border conflicts between Outer Mongolia and "Manchukuo," saying that there is no doubt that both Russia and Japan sincerely desire peace, at least for the time being. There is also no doubt that the disputes between the two countries can be resolved through diplomatic channels. However, it is doubtful whether the Japanese government and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs can be immune to compulsion by elements they cannot control. Japan's policy cannot be truly stabilized until a more permanent balance of power is established among the elements now vying for control. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) From the perspective of maintaining order in "Manchukuo" and guarding the borders of Manchuria, Mongolia, and the Soviet Union, the army believes that the current troops in Manchuria are insufficient. Therefore, in order to strengthen the military preparedness in Manchuria, it has been decided to send several divisions from the homeland to Manchuria. However, this will inevitably reduce the number of divisions in the homeland, so it is planned to establish two new divisions in the homeland to supplement them. The strengthening of military preparedness in Manchuria will begin next year, and the supplementing of divisions in the homeland will also be implemented gradually, starting next year.

<p>(Tokyo) Over the last three months, Tokyo police have arrested sixteen Japanese and one Russian who were acting as spies for the Soviet embassy. They will soon be tried in court for violating the Public Peace Preservation Law and the Military Secrets Law. According to newspapers, these individuals were acting on the orders of the intelligence department of the Soviet embassy. They began working last autumn, seeking certain documents, and it is reported that they obtained one, which was sold to the director of the intelligence department of the Soviet embassy for a large sum of money.

<h3>Australia Restricts Japanese Goods; Tax on Artificial Silk and Cotton Fabrics to be Increased; Japan Plans to Impose Retaliatory Taxes</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) It is reported that the Australian government has decided to increase import tariffs on Japanese artificial silk and cotton fabrics. If this happens, a trade war between Japan and Australia will break out next month. After discussions with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Japan has issued instructions to its Consul-General in Sydney, instructing him to inform the Australian government that Japan is prepared to take retaliatory measures against this tariff increase plan. According to the Asahi Shimbun, if the new taxes are implemented in May, then Japan will have no choice but to invoke the Trade Protection Act. The Japanese government is currently working with merchants to study ways to increase tariffs or use other methods to restrict Australian imports based on this law. Currently, the trade balance between Australia and Japan is quite favorable to Australia, and Australia's desire to restrict Japanese goods is making the Japanese people even more resentful. However, the business community does not fully agree with a trade war. Wool is a major Australian export, and if Japan increases its import tariffs on it, it will not only raise domestic prices, but also destroy Japan's export trade of woolen products. Australia has decided to restrict Japanese goods without considering Japanese retaliation because it knows that wool is an absolute necessity for Japan and that without it, it will not be able to maintain one of its largest export industries. Some Japanese government officials advocate taking strong action, such as Japan reducing wool imports and forcing manufacturers to include as much artificial silk in wool yarn as possible. Others advocate using the revenue from the tariffs on Australian wool to subsidize the import of wool from South Africa and South America. The Japanese believe that Australia's attitude is due to British pressure, because Britain wants to restrict Japanese goods from entering Australia in order to expand British goods' sales in Australia. The beef agreement between Britain and Australia, which Australia wants to continue, will begin to be discussed next year. Is Britain using Australia's restriction of Japanese goods as a condition for continuing this agreement? (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Two Japanese Squad Leaders Jumped onto Railway and Were Crushed to Death; Said to be Opposed to the Invasion of China</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Some time ago, two squad leaders from the 4th Company of the 4th Railway Artillery Unit of the Japanese Army, Tomio Imura and Masaru Taguchi, jumped onto the railway near Kii Village, Kaiso District, Wakayama Prefecture, and were crushed to death by an express train from Osaka. These two were promising young men, and why they took such a drastic measure was questioned by many at the time. Later, soldiers in the unit secretly said that the two men were both well-educated and not easily deceived by militarist propaganda. They had always maintained an anti-war stance, especially opposing Japan's invasion of China. Their suicide was said to contain the meaning of remonstrance with their lives.

<h3>Serious Strikes and Lockouts in Palestine; Arabs Boycott Jewish Goods</h3>
<p>Jerusalem: The conflict between Jews and Arabs in Palestine is still serious. Strikes and lockouts are still in progress. However, many Jewish shops have reopened despite the threats from Arabs. Most small-scale business merchants, affected by the incident, are unable to repay their debts and are requesting delayed payments from creditors. The traffic on the roads between this city and the outer provinces is currently being protected by armed police along the way. However, Italian tourists who come here to visit the Holy City are still being pelted with stones by protesters. Traffic between Tel Aviv and Jaffa has not yet been restored. The eastern market in Tel Aviv was originally scheduled to open on Thursday, and the authorities plan to hold it as scheduled, but some people think that Arabs and Jews may clash again. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>

<h3>Polish Control of Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>Warsaw - Polish President Mościcki today ordered a ban on citizens freely buying gold and foreign currency, or exporting them. (National Telegraph, 26th)</p>
<p>Warsaw - The government gazette has just published an order placing foreign exchange operations under government control, stipulating that such operations can only be carried out with the permission of the Polish National Bank. (Havas News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>Warsaw - The government issued an order this morning stipulating that foreign exchange operations should be controlled by the government. This is because, despite repeated government declarations to maintain the value of the national currency, the Złoty, speculation continued in the financial markets. Citizens holding the national currency continued to sell it to exchange for gold or foreign currency. The government therefore issued the above order to crack down. This order took effect this morning. All postal remittances have been suspended. Letters sent abroad with banknotes are also refused. When mailing registered letters, people are not allowed to seal the original letter so that it can be verified whether there are banknotes enclosed. In addition, banks and exchange offices have been ordered not to buy or sell gold and foreign currency. The stock exchange has also been temporarily closed pending further notice, to prevent speculators from manipulating government bonds and various U.S. dollar securities. Foreign companies established in Poland with foreign currency as capital are subject to this order. However, government bonds issued abroad, for which principal and interest are due, will continue to be remitted and are not subject to the ban. Finally, it is stipulated that citizens traveling abroad are only allowed to carry 500 Złoty in national currency per person. (Havas News Agency, 27th)</p>

<h3>Advisor to the King of Afghanistan Flees by Plane from France, Vanishes Without Trace</h3>
<p>(Paris) - French aviator Trouville, today at the Villacoublay airfield, defied the local authorities' prohibition and flew away in a plane purchased by the King of Afghanistan. The authorities immediately ordered the French Sky Police and all the airfields in the country to pay close attention. However, no news of Trouville has been heard so far. Trouville's plane was not loaded with food and water, and he had not obtained a passport. If he lands at any official airfield, there will inevitably be trouble. According to aviation experts, Trouville must have flown to Spain, and from there to northeastern Africa, or it is said that Trouville will fly to Athens, and stop there briefly. Trouville's move, whether legal or not, is unanimously considered a courageous act.</p>
<p>(Rome) - French aviator Trouillet, who was hired as the aviation advisor to the King of Afghanistan, disregarded the prohibition of the country's officials the other day and flew out of the Villacoublay airfield without permission.

<h3>Lecture on Chemistry 1: The Teaching of Chemistry in Secondary Schools (Part 1) - Chen Kezhong, Full-time Compiler, National Institute for Compilation and Translation</h3>
<p>At present, science education in China has gradually embarked on a path of prosperity, which cannot but be considered a cause for rejoicing. For example, the increasing number of specialized scientific personnel and the progress of scientific research institutions and various university colleges of science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine are clear examples. However, this trend of progress in science education seems to only affect a small number of academic and educational institutions in large cities, while ordinary secondary schools are unable to participate, resulting in slow progress in science for middle school students. We know that middle school students are the lifeblood of the country, and secondary education is the throat of all education. If secondary education fails, it will affect primary education from below and higher education from above. In other words, there is no need to talk about the implementation of any education. The education authorities are certainly very clear about this, so they have been keen to rectify secondary education in recent years, especially making efforts to improve science education. The recent promulgation of the curriculum standards for primary and secondary schools and the standards for science equipment in secondary schools can also be regarded as the prelude to the education authorities' improvement of secondary education. However, for three or four years after the promulgation of the curriculum standards, secondary science education does not seem to have made significant progress. Leaving aside other things, let's just talk about chemistry. According to the curriculum standards of the Ministry of Education, chemistry classes in the second year of junior high school are four hours per week in the first semester and three hours per week in the second semester; high school chemistry is also studied in the second year, with four hours of lectures per week and three hours of experiments in the first semester and two hours in the second semester. Judging from this, a high school graduate has two years of chemistry lectures and one year of experiments in chemistry. The preparation of middle school students in chemistry is at most the same as in other countries in the world, but according to the reports of chemistry personnel in various universities, the level of chemistry of students taking the university entrance exam over the years is not satisfactory. On the surface, the preparation for chemistry in secondary schools seems to be very adequate, but the result is still disappointing. After careful investigation of this reason, it is generally nothing more than the following:</p>
<p>Imperfect editing of textbooks. Looking at the chemistry textbooks we have reviewed in the past, most of them inevitably have these problems: In general, the content of chemistry textbooks is always too much. The chemistry textbooks in junior high school almost include all the materials to be taught in high school, and the textbooks in high school often force university textbooks into them. Originally, it is not a bad thing for a book to have very detailed content and very rich materials, but these textbooks are for middle school students, and we should pay attention to the importance and depth of the materials. Otherwise, these textbooks are not suitable for beginners. Some editors lack experience in teaching in middle schools, and as a result, the materials they compile are either too deep or too shallow. Some editors are not very clear about the recent developments in chemistry; because chemistry is a science that changes rapidly, if editors do not refer to new materials, the books they compile will inevitably be outdated. What is said is mostly the old tune of ten years ago. For example, when it comes to the number of elements discovered, some textbooks say there are eighty-six, and some say there are ninety. This big difference clearly shows that they are very isolated from the recent progress of chemistry. In addition, there are a few editors who have very shallow knowledge of chemistry. Most of these editors are not specialized in chemistry. They casually find a few chemistry books to copy, and they themselves do not understand the theories and facts of chemistry. Of course, the content of the textbooks compiled in this way cannot be questioned.</p>
<p>Insufficient school equipment. We know that except for a few provinces with relatively developed education and relatively sufficient education funding, the science equipment in secondary schools is very simple. In some provinces, the chemistry equipment in secondary schools cannot even provide students with experiments, let alone demonstration experiments by teachers. Chemistry is originally an experimental science. Without experiments and field observations, it is impossible for middle school students to understand chemistry and become interested in it. Therefore, no matter how much the teachers talk on the podium, the students always listen with blank expressions. It is really "the speaker speaks earnestly, but the listener listens indifferently."</p>
<p>Teachers lack the spirit of research and progress. Teachers bear a great responsibility for the inability to improve the level of chemistry in middle school students. Because if the textbooks have improper places, excellent teachers can freely choose and discard them according to the students' level to remedy the shortcomings of the textbooks. If the school equipment is simple, teachers can also find ways to remedy it. There are many simple chemistry experiments that teachers can make simple instruments to use themselves. Even for schools with money, if teachers can find ways to make simple instruments themselves, then the money saved can be used to buy more expensive instruments. Conversely, some schools have sufficient funding for equipment, but if the teachers do not have the spirit of research and progress, then they are often careless about the purchase and preparation of equipment, and it is easy to lead to waste. As for the extent to which this waste has been done in secondary schools, I don't have precise data at the moment, but as far as universities are concerned, this waste is terrible. I remember that the last time I inspected a university, one of the main personnel of a science department pointed out a very expensive optical instrument to us with a very triumphant look, but after our careful inspection, we found that this instrument was missing a component, and as a result, this very expensive instrument was just for show and not for use. Other universities also inevitably have this kind of waste problem. Looking at it this way, the money that should be saved cannot be saved, but there is no money to buy the things that are really needed. I think this situation is probably unavoidable in secondary schools. In addition, teachers also have a common shortcoming, that is, they also commit the same problem as the editors. They don't have the opportunity to refer to new materials and only teach dead books. The materials taught today are the same as last year, and the materials taught last year are the same as the year before. How can this arouse students' interest?</p>
<p>Changes in the education system and standards. In the past, our country's education system and standards often changed, making it difficult for school authorities to formulate a fixed plan, and teachers also had no fixed track to follow in teaching. The editing of textbooks is also affected. For example, the previous decision on the curriculum was to teach physics before chemistry, and now it is to teach chemistry before physics. In this way, the content of physics and chemistry textbooks, especially the materials that have the closest relationship between physics and chemistry, the editing procedure has to be changed. This kind of change in standards is rare in foreign countries, so when their textbooks are reprinted or revised, they only insert new materials, and do not change the compilation and style very much. As a result, they are getting better and better. Chinese textbooks, because of the changes in the education system and standards, the changes in textbooks are often not to increase new materials, but to cater to the new education system and new standards. Therefore, the textbooks are compiled and compiled, but there is still not much progress. This is a general statement. As for many textbooks that have been published in the third or fourth edition, or even the tenth or eighth edition (this of course refers to books that have not been reviewed by the Ministry of Education or have expired), and their content is still completely the same as the first edition, this kind of lack of progress cannot of course be attributed to changes in standards.</p>
<p>Recently, the education authorities have also understood the above problems, so they have already formulated several remedies for these shortcomings. Now let me talk about what I personally know:</p>

<h3>Japanese Military Attaché Conference in Tianjin: Focus on Anti-Communism</h3>
<p>Japan hopes for the emergence of a new organization</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence - Japanese military attachés stationed in North China gathered at the residence of the Japanese military commander in Zhangyuan, Tianjin, at 3:00 PM on the 26th. Participants included Tsurumatsu Muro, Deputy Director of the Special Service Agency in Beiping, Bin Tian; Imai of the Japanese Embassy in Beiping; Ueno, Director of the Special Service Agency in Tongzhou; Wachi, Director of the Special Service Agency in Taiyuan; Habayama, Director of the Special Service Agency in Suiyuan; Omoto, Military Attaché in Zhangjiakou; Ishino, Military Attaché in Jinan; Kadosaki, Director of the Special Service Agency in Tianjin; Hosoki, Director of the Special Service Agency in Shanhaiguan. Observers included Mutaguchi, Commander of the Infantry Battalion stationed in Beiping; Kayashima, Commander of the Infantry Unit stationed in Tianjin; Shinabe, Commander of the Infantry Unit stationed in Tangshan; Kagawa, Commander of the Infantry Unit stationed in Tanggu; and Kuwabara, Military Attaché of the Navy stationed in Beiping; Kubota, Military Attaché in Tianjin. Participants from the Japanese military in Tianjin included Chief of Staff Nagami; Senior Staff Officer Ishii; Lin and Okada attached to the unit; Staff Officers Nakai and Dokyowaki. Except for Takahashi, the military attaché in Qingdao, who went to Shanghai to meet Kita, Japanese military attachés from all over North China came to the meeting. The meeting was originally scheduled for two days, but because there were not many proposals, it was concluded in just one afternoon. The important proposals can be divided into approximately five items: 1. The communist problem in North China; 2. Economic development issues (including the Longyan Iron Mine, Pingtangshan Smelter, and extending the Cangshi Railway to become the Qishi Railway, from Qikou to Shijiazhuang); 3. Current general diplomatic issues in Hebei and Chahar; 4. Preparations before strengthening the Japanese garrison in North China; 5. Other issues related to the operation and guidance of the Hebei-Chahar regime. At the beginning of the meeting, Nagami reported on his experience attending the division commander's meeting after returning to Japan, and conveyed the instructions of the army headquarters. At 3:30 PM, discussions began on the various predetermined agenda items. Nagami was the focus of the meeting, so he made the most speeches and proposals. There was a long discussion on specific plans for dealing with communism in North China. The final opinion was still to urge the Hebei-Chahar regime to quickly and clearly sign an agreement to establish a Sino-Japanese anti-communist committee. The Japanese military attachés attending the meeting are scheduled to leave Tianjin one after another on the 27th to return to their posts. Before leaving Tianjin, Tsurumatsu Muro plans to visit Song Zheyuan and Xiao Zhenying with Nagami to discuss the opinions decided at the meeting as a fixed and unchangeable negotiation policy. Xiao Zhenying went to Beiping a few days ago to attend the Economic Committee of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council and hurriedly returned to Tianjin on the afternoon of the 26th to prepare for the meeting on the 27th. Ishii, a staff officer of the Japanese army stationed in Tianjin, is scheduled to fly back to Tokyo on the morning of the 27th with the records of the talks between Nagami and Xiao Zhenying, Chen Juesheng, and Chen Zhongfu, as well as the results of this military attaché conference, to report and represent Nagami at the chief of staff meeting on the first of next month. On the way to Shenyang, he will visit Ueta, commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army in Changchun, to exchange opinions, which will be used to unify diplomatic steps, and will return around the tenth of next month. At that time, the appropriate implementation methods for strengthening the Japanese garrison in North China will be announced separately.</p>
<p>Regarding the conference, according to Bin Tian, "There are specific measures for the North China Anti-Communist Agreement, but it is only a verbal agreement between the two parties, and there is no special agreement or treaty signed. Anti-communism in Hebei Province is indeed important, but this military attaché conference did not intend to make any discussions. Ishii's return to Japan is not solely for this matter. There has been no change in Hebei-Chahar diplomacy recently. Whether it is resolved or not depends on whether the Hebei-Chahar authorities have sincerity." It is also heard that with regard to anti-communism in North China, the Japanese side is not only urging the authorities to establish a Sino-Japanese joint anti-communist committee, but intends that all administrative and military affairs in Hebei and Chahar should be controlled by an organization similar to a committee. At the very least, it must be like the puppet government of East Hebei, with everything that it should have. Although it is not necessary to clearly express how it should be, the North China regime must in fact be able to maintain a concrete and independent buffer organization that is not affiliated with any party, and then the Japanese side will be relieved and temporarily let go, allowing the authorities to follow the guidance. The cancellation of the puppet organizations in East Hebei and Chahar will not become an issue at this point. However, this is not what the current authorities are willing to do. The reason why negotiations cannot be developed at present lies in this. Therefore, judging from the current situation, a method must be established for anti-communism. The current authorities do not deny the need for this. As for the cancellation of the puppet organizations in Hebei and Chahar, it will probably be another matter, and the resolution will be difficult again. (26th)</p>
<h3>Hebei Province Bans Potent Narcotics, Implements Opium Monopoly</h3>
<p>More than 2,000 sales outlets throughout the province Monthly sales of native opium amount to over one million yuan 150,000 people buy and smoke opium</p>
<p>Baoding Correspondence - The Hebei provincial government has implemented a ban on potent narcotics, repeatedly issuing strict orders to its subordinates to handle it conscientiously, and instructing the joint military-police inspection office to earnestly crack down on it. In recent months, more than a hundred people have been arrested in Baoding, Shijiazhuang, and other places for transporting and consuming drugs. Those who transport drugs are generally executed by firing squad. Those who only consume drugs are ordered to quit and sentenced to eight to twelve years in prison. As a result, those who live by transporting potent narcotics have disappeared. The number of traffickers of potent narcotics who have been executed by firing squad by the Security Command since the beginning of this month has reached more than a dozen. On the 4th, a female criminal, Zhang Wangshi, was executed by firing squad. On the 11th, Zhu Zichen, Tang Qingyun, and Zhou Zhenhai were executed by firing squad. On the 12th, Jin Zixiang was executed by firing squad. On the 13th, Qin Xinyuan and Shi Junling were executed by firing squad. On the 18th, Yan Guangya was executed by firing squad (Yan Guangya was the president of the Baoding Minsheng Newspaper). In addition, as many as seventy or eighty people were sentenced to imprisonment and sent to drug rehabilitation centers, causing the Baoding Public Security Bureau Drug Rehabilitation Center and the Qingyuan County Drug Rehabilitation Center to be overcrowded.</p>
<p>The provincial government strictly prohibits potent narcotics, but at the same time, it has lifted the ban on opium and implemented a monopoly. It has also established a clearing office to be responsible for handling it. Each county has created a branch office to assist in the process. More than ninety counties have now established clearing branch offices, all of which are contracted by merchants for a period of three months. Each county branch office pays a contracting fee of 200 to 400 yuan, and the county branch office then recruits sub-sales outlets in various villages and towns. Many county sub-sales outlets have also been established. In Baoding city alone, there are already sixteen sub-sales outlets, and there are also many sub-sales outlets in the villages and towns in the four townships. It is recently estimated that more than 2,000 sub-sales outlets have been established in total. These sub-sales outlets are opium sales outlets. The opium sold is all government opium, which is distributed by the provincial clearing office to the county branch offices, and then by the county branch offices to the various sales outlets for sale. The official price of opium is 2.6 yuan per tael, and opium paste is 5 yuan per tael. Each sub-sales outlet turns on lights to serve customers, and it is extremely convenient for addicts to enter and exit. Therefore, most people who smoke white powder have switched to smoking opium. Not only can they avoid being banned, but they can also smoke openly. Although it is still in the initial stage of establishment, it is estimated that the monthly sales of native opium will reach more than one million yuan, and it will increase in the future. As for this government opium, it all comes from Suiyuan. The famous Jehol Kou opium is all bought by a certain party and cannot be transported to the interior. Since the lifting of the opium ban, sub-sales outlets have opened in various places. According to statistics, there are more than 2,000 sub-sales outlets in the province, and approximately 150,000 people go to buy and smoke opium every day. The staggering number is lamentable.

<h3>Beiping Banking Association Obeys Order to Prohibit Silver Coins</h3>
<p>Hebei Provincial Bank will take over the Silver Coin Bureau Provincial Bank plans to unify the issuance rights of copper coin notes</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence - Since the Ministry of Finance stipulated the change of the monetary system last November, all silver coins buried in the private sector have been exchanged at the Central, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications within a limited period. Circulation is not allowed on the market. Subsequently, the Central Bank extended the deadline for exchanging legal tender to May 3rd. As the deadline is approaching, the Beiping Banking Association has separately notified each bank to complete the exchange within the limited period. It is heard that after the silver in Beiping City is sealed in place, it has been inspected once. Now that there have been exchanges during the exchange period, the Tianjin branch of the Issuance Reserve Management Committee plans to conduct a second inspection after the exchange period expires.</p>
<p>The Hebei Provincial Bank recently received an order from the Hebei Provincial Government to take over the Hebei Silver Coin Bureau. After receiving the order, the bank specially dispatched Zhang Qingxun to lead the takeover personnel and arrived in Beiping from Beijing the day before yesterday. Zhang went to visit Wei Zidan, the manager of the bureau, to discuss the takeover as soon as possible. Wei said that he was responsible to the board of directors and the general meeting of shareholders and had to convene a general meeting of shareholders, submit it for approval, and then hand over the affairs. Zhang reported to Yang Tianshou, the general manager of the Hebei Provincial Bank, yesterday and asked for instructions. Yang told him to postpone it and take over after the bureau's procedures were completed. Zhang left the bureau and returned to Tianjin. At the same time, Wei also consulted with Nie Peiyuan, the chairman of the bureau, and others and decided to convene a general meeting of shareholders next week to resolve this issue. According to sources, the reason why the Hebei Provincial Bank was ordered to take over the Hebei Silver Coin Bureau this time is that it plans to hand over the copper coin notes issued by the bank to the Hebei Silver Coin Bureau for issuance. After consultation with the directors of the bureau, it was decided that after the bank took over the Hebei Silver Coin Bureau, the copper coin notes issued by the bank would be merged and issued to unify the issuance rights of copper coin notes in Hebei Province.</p>
<p>The issue of canceling the standard price of copper coins in Beiping City has been submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau by the Beiping Chamber of Commerce for reconsideration. The bureau has forwarded it to the municipal government for instructions and notified the chamber. The Beiping Financial Maintenance Association has decided to thoroughly decide on the abolition of the standard price of copper coins at a meeting after the issue of the issuance of copper coin notes by the Hebei Provincial Bank is resolved, which is currently in progress. Therefore, the association has postponed the meeting. At the same time, the Social Affairs Bureau has decided to wait for the association to convene a meeting to resolve it. (24th)</p>
<h3>Anhui-Jiangxi Black Tea Transportation and Sales Registered with 260 Companies, Loan of 1.6 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The black tea produced in Qimen, Zhide, and Fuliang counties of Anhui and Jiangxi provinces is under the unified transportation and external trade management of the joint Anhui and Jiangxi Provincial Governments' Transportation and Sales Committee. Xia Gengying, section chief of the Anhui Construction Department, and Liu Chongju, technical expert of the Jiangxi Construction Department, were dispatched to the above three counties to handle registration, loans, and oversee all transportation and sales matters. Xia and others have now largely completed their tasks and have arrived in Wuhu from Tunxi. However, the unified transportation and sales of black tea have aroused fierce opposition from foreign tea firms in Shanghai, and a serious incident of suspending transactions has already occurred. Therefore, we specially visited Xia and others to inquire about the situation. They explained the previous tea firm brokerage situation and the status after the implementation of unified transportation and sales, which are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Tea Firm Brokerage Monopolization and Exploitation</p>
<p>Foreign tea firms are essentially brokers who are responsible for the trade of black tea arriving in Shanghai from the two provinces. Before the tea market approaches, tea firms obtain large loans from foreign companies or banks and then lend them to local tea houses in the form of drafts. Based on the production volume, the standard is an average loan of 20 yuan per box. Statistics show that each tea house receives a loan of up to 30,000 yuan or as little as 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. The tea houses then lend this money to tea farmers and gradually collect their products to be transported to Shanghai. Foreign tea firms thus gain the power to directly trade with foreign countries. However, these drafts from tea firms must also be used to provide loans to green tea tea houses. Therefore, when there is an urgent need for funds, it is difficult to audit the cost of tea leaves, and they are sold off quickly. As a result, the direct losses suffered by tea merchants and tea farmers cannot be calculated. After the tea firms' turnover, the profits obtained from the more than ten items listed on the warehouse receipt exceed 15%, and the interest on the draft loan is also 1.5%.</p>
<p>Tea Merchants Need Unified Transportation and Sales</p>
<p>The provincial government recently implemented unified transportation and sales in order to allow tea merchants to trade directly with foreign countries and reduce the large amount of exploitation they face. Currently, the provincial government charges only 8% interest on loans, and other unified sales handling fees total only 2%. They are not in a hurry to recover the loans, allowing tea leaves to have the opportunity to be sold at a good price. The suffering of tea merchants from previous monopolization and exploitation can be completely eliminated. Since the establishment of the Transportation and Sales Committee, the registered tea houses include 125 in Qimen, 67 in Fuliang, and Zhide has not yet been completed. The government loan is already 1.2 million yuan, and the cooperative loan is 400,000 yuan, totaling around 1.6 million yuan. It is estimated that about 60,000 boxes of black tea will be produced this year, which should meet the needs of buyers. In terms of transportation, the two provincial highway bureaus and the Jiangnan and Zhe-Gan railways have agreed on the lowest freight rate to directly transport the tea to Shanghai. After the implementation of unified transportation and sales, tea merchants in Qimen, Fuliang, and Zhide counties have sent telegrams to the Ministry of Industry, the Economic Committee, and the Anhui and Jiangxi provincial governments, expressing their support. This shows the need for tea merchants for unified sales. (26th)</p>
<h3>Shandong Province Planning to Build the Jinan-Liaocheng Railway Fundraising for Construction through Private Shares, Boshan Road to Be Extended</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Regarding the construction of the Jinan-Liaocheng Railway, relevant parties are actively proceeding. Ge Guangting, chairman of the Jiaoji Railway Committee, came to Jinan from Qingdao early on the 26th because all progress on the railway must be planned in consultation with the provincial government. According to Ge, "My task in coming to Jinan this time is to discuss with Chairman Han the issues of land acquisition and road construction for the Jinan-Liaocheng Railway, as well as the issue of raising private shares. The budget plan for the Jinan-Liaocheng Railway has long been submitted to the ministry for approval. The railway company's articles of association are being revised by the ministry and have not yet been issued. Once issued, we will immediately start preparations. This railway is a joint government-business venture. In addition to the railway and the provincial government undertaking a portion of the shares, if funds are insufficient, the Ministry of Railways can also undertake some. Each private share is set at 100 yuan, and we plan to raise as much as possible without restrictions. However, based on the public's interest in investing in railways and the current economic situation, I dare not predict how much private capital can be raised. Comparing it with current general deposits, interest rates have now been reduced to 7%. The interest rate of this railway in the future will be more than 7%, and the guarantee will be more practical. Our railway has a large stock of materials, worth about one million yuan, which can be used. Except for adding some scattered materials, there is no need to purchase large materials. The total expenditure is estimated to be no more than 3 million yuan. If we recruit workers to build the road, we will save a lot of money, and there should be no major difficulties. In the future, we will set up an office in Jinan to increase work efficiency. The name, whether it is a preparation office or an engineering bureau, has not yet been determined. Committee Member Song (Ruoyu) will be responsible, and the staff will be transferred from our railway to save public funds. Now the people's awareness has improved. In the past, when building railways, the people in the surrounding areas mostly opposed it. Now, not only do they not oppose it, but they also demand construction, which shows that the people's wisdom has been opened. After discussing everything with Chairman Han, the start date should not be far away. As for extending the Zhangdian-Boshan branch line, it has been approved by the Ministry of Railways. All materials will also be used from the old materials stored by our railway, costing tens of thousands of yuan. In the future, it will be extended to Xintai and Laiwu to develop the local mineral production. It is planned to set up three or four stations along the road. This route is shorter, and all preparations are simpler. Construction can begin soon. However, there are many mountains between Xin and Lai, making construction more difficult. But building ten miles can prosper ten miles, and building twenty miles can develop twenty miles, slowly moving forward, but it will take more time," he said. According to Song Ruoyu, "I have been appointed by the Ministry of Railways as a member of the Jiaoji Railway Committee and have now taken office. This time, I came to Jinan with the chairman to visit Chairman Han to discuss the construction of the Jinan-Liaocheng Railway. The roadbed of the railway has been completely determined (the passing places will not be changed) and the survey has been completed. We are now actively preparing to proceed. I will go to Beijing in a few days to contact and ask for instructions from the Ministry of Railways," he said. (26th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang Civil Servants Uniformly Wear Uniforms</h3>
<p>The provincial government stipulates that civil servants must wear uniforms. The Commissioner's Office has issued a notice to the civil servants of all counties under its jurisdiction to implement this on May 1st. The Shanghai Youli Uniform Store has been designated as the supplier. In order to implement civil servant training from May 1st, the civil servant uniforms will be made of domestic yellow khaki cloth, including soft-brimmed hats, belts, and leggings, at a cost of 3.9 yuan per set. The uniform store has sent personnel to Songjiang today to take measurements at the county government, various bureaus, and district offices to ensure that the uniforms can be worn as scheduled.</p>
<h3>Fengxian Planning to Change to Collecting Land Value Tax</h3>
<p>In Fengxian County, since the implementation of "Grain for Certificates" during the Tongzhi period of the Qing Dynasty, more than 70 years have passed. The terrain has undergone many changes, and the old field certificates have been mostly lost. The people have established their own substitute certificates, using certificates to replace certificates. However, disputes have arisen over the years, leading to endless litigation. Therefore, local people are eagerly awaiting land measurement, and the provincial government is also aware of this. In the autumn of the 21st year, Dong Jin was appointed to establish a bureau to handle the matter. Over the years, he has been able to carefully plan and work hard. In addition to completing the land measurement work in the winter of the 23rd year, he is now continuing to complete the registration work. In order to abolish the land tax and equalize the burden, the provincial government has appointed Inspector Zhang Baozhi to Fengxian to guide everything. It is scheduled to change to collecting land value tax this year. The land, which was previously as chaotic as hemp, can now be thoroughly clarified.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Sulun Yarn Factory Sex Scandal Lawsuit</h3>
<p>The Sulun Textile Factory outside Panmen is the largest factory in Suzhou, with 2,800 male and female workers. The general manager is Yan Xinqi, the fourth son of Yan Yutang, the general manager of Shanghai Guangyu Business Company. There is a female worker named Zhu Yindi in the factory who is quite attractive and is appreciated by the factory affairs director Pu Liangyuan. Another female worker named Jiang Fengying asked Zhu Yindi for her consent and Pu Liangyuan gave Zhu Yindi a large number of ornaments, such as Yangzhou wooden combs. Because Zhu did not agree, Pu was angry and removed Zhu from the list. Zhu negotiated with Jiang Fengying, even beating her, and involving Pu Liangyuan and General Manager Yan Xinqi. It is said that Yan and Jiang seem to have a relationship, so a fun case of mutual accusations occurred. Jiang Fengying hired lawyer Liu Zuwang to accuse Zhu Yindi and her mother of obstructing freedom, injury, and damage. Zhu Yindi hired lawyer Jing Shuxian to accuse Jiang Fengying of defamation and damage. Yan Xinqi hired lawyer Liu Zuwang to accuse Zhu Yindi of libel. The court has conducted two preliminary investigations and is now scheduled to hold a public hearing on the 30th.</p>
<h3>Sun Zuji's Testimony in the Tan Zhuohong Case</h3>
<p>Tan Zhuohong, a judge of the Shanghai Local Court, and lawyer Yang Shaopeng were accused in a case. The Wuxian Local Court held a hearing on the afternoon of the 25th and summoned four Shanghai lawyers, Sun Zuji, Gao Junxiang, Zhu Yisheng, and Li Shirui, to testify. On that day, Sun Zuji could not come to Suzhou to report due to appearing in court in Shanghai, and submitted a statement stating that he would come to Suzhou on Monday to be interrogated. Li Shirui had already died of illness. Yesterday (the 27th), Monday, Sun Zuji arrived in Suzhou from Shanghai and reported to the Wudi Court at 10 am. The court president immediately opened the court for questioning. Wu Chao, the defense lawyer hired by Tan Zhuohong and Yang Shaopeng, did not appear in court. Neither of the defendants, Tan and Yang, were signed to the court for questioning. Sun Zuji testified that he was from Wuxi, lived on Fuxu Road in Shanghai, and worked as a lawyer. He did not know Yang Shaopeng, but he had seen his name. He requested an extension of one day because he was arguing in court in Shanghai the day before yesterday. It is true that Yang Shaopeng is a classmate, but he was in a class a few sessions ahead of me. I have met Tan Zhuohong in court. Zhu Yisheng is a colleague, Gao Junxiang is a classmate, and I am not very familiar with Zhu. He is a very upright person. Li Shirui is indeed dead. I know him. I don't know much about whether he is usually proper or improper. He is a good person, and there is no disagreement with Yang, and even less with Tan. The case of Zhang Qidong suing Song Dazheng for defamation was my and Lawyer Du's joint representation of the plaintiffs Zhang Qidong and Yang Dingchen. The lawsuit was filed around October 3rd or 4th last year. The first hearing was on October 14th, and the plaintiffs and their agents were all in court. The defendant Song Dazheng did not appear. At that time, the agent presented the plaintiff's intention to sue and then adjourned the hearing. The date of the hearing was not announced in court. Later, I did not appear in court. Yang Shaopeng came to my office two days after the hearing (October 16th) with a card. The tea room attendant notified me with the card. At that time, there was another person in the reception room, and Lawyer Yang sat and waited beside. This was the first formal conversation with Lawyer Yang. He asked if I was handling the case of Zhang Qidong and Yang Dingchen suing Song Dazheng for defamation. I asked him if he represented the defendant Song Dazheng. He was vague. He said that the presiding judge asked me to say that the evidence presented by the plaintiff was weak, and Judge Tan asked me to say that if a considerable price was paid, the defendant could be arrested, and asked me to convey this to the plaintiff. I replied that the plaintiff was a school teacher, so there was no way. I did not pursue him. After he left, I told my clerks Chen Fengming and Wang Jiacheng in the writing room that the lawyer was actually acting as a pimp for the judge, which was really strange. About twenty days later, the parties Zhang Qidong and Yang Dingchen came together, and I talked about this matter, and they also thought it was strange. Later, I did not go to the second or third hearing. I heard from Lawyer Du about the situation of the hearing. The summons for the defendant was served, but he did not appear in court, which was very strange. Lawyer Du requested the issuance of an arrest warrant in court, but Judge Tan said that this was a small case and there was no need to issue an arrest warrant. The plaintiff then requested a ruling, but Judge Tan did not agree. Later, the case was withdrawn. There are two kinds of relations for the withdrawal. I do not know about other parts of the case against Tan and Yang, such as the Wu Peizhen case and the Dian Yun Shang case. I do not know Chen Hanshi, Han Chu, and Shen Fengzao. After Judge Yu finished his statement, he announced the adjournment of the court and ordered Sun Zuji to return.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Joint Suppression of Bandits by Water and Land Police</h3>
<p>Wu Qifang, the administrative inspector and district security commander of the Wuxi district, previously received reports from various counties along Taihu Lake that bandits had been found in East Taihu Lake. He has telegraphed to the counties along the lake to strictly prevent and suppress them, and telegraphed to the provincial government for instructions. Yesterday, he specifically ordered Zheng Dexin, the captain of the 6th Brigade of the Provincial Security Team stationed in Wuxi, to select capable troops to join the water police to strictly search and suppress the bandits in order to eliminate them. Lie, the district chief of the 2nd District of the Water Public Security in Suzhou, also received an order from the province yesterday to strictly suppress the lake bandits. He specifically ordered all teams under his command and all officers and soldiers of the Zhaowu, Peirong, Anjing, and Sanqian Shui Bing warships to mobilize and set off to East and West Taihu Lakes and Dianshan Lake to conduct a large-scale joint patrol. He also sent telegrams to Wuxi, Wujiang, Wujin, and Yixing counties to send police to assist in preventing and blocking. He led the special team of police to set off from Suzhou to search and suppress the bandits at 7 am yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Railway Worker Dispute Resolved</h3>
<p>The stevedores at Wuxi Station of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway were previously contracted by Meng Jinsun. However, due to frequent conflicts between the workers and the foreman, both transportation and commerce suffered losses. Therefore, the railway bureau took back the management. The contractor and the workers then had a dispute over the deposit issue, which led to litigation in the court for a long time. Shi Wenshi from the Special Party Department of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway and Yuan Qiaofu and Zhang Yunhe from the Railway Workers' Union, Mao Shoujin from the Traffic Department, and Fang Ziqing from the Railway Police Section came to Wuxi to convene a meeting between the two parties to mediate. The following mediation principles were decided: Meng Jinsun will provide a one-time subsidy of 357 yuan in national currency to the workers, and the money should be distributed to each worker for their use according to their names. All copper brand certificates issued to the workers will be invalidated from today. Meng Jinsun will publish an apology in the newspaper. Both parties expressed satisfaction at the time and passed the resolution. Thus, the dispute between the railway stevedores was resolved.</p>

The Suzhou-Wuxi transportation will be more convenient. Within this county, the road starts from the railway station, passes through the foot of Xishan, Yangxi Road, Nanqiao, Zhouxin Town, and Yuxin'an, and reaches Wangting along the canal bank. Then it turns into the inland area of ​​Huguan and reaches the Changmen Gate of Suzhou.</p>
<h3>Changshu Commissioner's Office Investigates Sand Case</h3>
<p>The authorities of Shazhou City in the Seventh District dug out the Ergan River and the violent citizens opposed it, even digging up the river dam, causing all the river works to be destroyed. The authorities arrested Tan Wujin and Ding Shishu, the leaders of the violent citizens, but they were taken back by the violent citizens. The security team was sent to the countryside, but they were unable to stop their actions because the party had 500 or 600 people and guns. The police team did not dare to shoot until they were ordered to do so. So far, there has been no way to solve it for half a month. After the township chief Geng Shimin's residence and his private hospital were destroyed, there was no guarantee for others. After the county government reported to the Commissioner's Office, Zhang Zhongchu was sent to Changshu to investigate on the 27th of this month, and planned to detain the leaders. Zhang Zhongchu went to the countryside to investigate with the captain of the security team in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Jiading Central Committee Sends Members to Inspect Rice Borer Control</h3>

Wu came to the city on the 25th to go to the county government for an examination, which proved to be true. It was decided to arrest the leaders to warn against imitation.</p>
<h3>Stamping Receipts to Prevent Abuses</h3>
<p>The county government and the accounting director's office, in order to eliminate the abuses of grain books, jointly ordered the district offices on the 25th to instruct the village chiefs to stipulate that the receipt of the grain paid by the households in the future should state the amount of silver and be stamped with the name to prevent abuses.</p>

After all the members of the group shook hands and exchanged greetings with the welcoming personnel, they boarded the Dalla Company's passenger ferry to cross the river to Pudong. At 8:30 AM, they arrived at the new customs wharf, disembarked, and then took cars to the New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road to rest.</p>
<p>Motivation for Returning to the Country</p>
<p>Wang Quansheng, the head of the Philippines Overseas Chinese Inspection Group, said in an interview on the ship that the Overseas Chinese in the Philippines were very excited about the progress made in various industries and businesses, as well as cultural and educational construction, in the motherland. However, the news reported in the newspapers was limited and not very clear, and there was a lack of understanding of the overall situation in the motherland. Therefore, they specifically initiated and organized the Philippines Overseas Chinese Inspection Group to return to the country for on-site inspection, so as to introduce the industrial and commercial conditions and cultural and educational situation of the motherland to all Overseas Chinese in the Philippines and jointly develop the motherland. He added that the group's organizational content is three-quarters from the industrial and commercial sectors and one-quarter from the education sector. This is the biggest motivation and hope for the group's return to the country.</p>
<p>Status of Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>There are approximately 140,000 Overseas Chinese from our country in the Philippines, most of whom are engaged in industry and commerce and import and export trade. The relationship between China and the Philippines is still relatively harmonious. In recent years, some lower and middle-class people in the Philippines, instigated by people from a certain country, have harbored some jealousy towards our Overseas Chinese. However, the upper-class people in the Philippines are very clear about the past relations between China and the Philippines, so the relationship between each other can still be harmonious. No overall anti-Chinese incidents have occurred, or if the Philippine government has established harsh regulations for Overseas Chinese, then Overseas Chinese will naturally rise up to oppose them for their own interests. However, this kind of incident is a legal issue, and the overall Sino-Philippine relationship has not been affected in any way.</p>
<p>Inspection Itinerary</p>
<p>Wang stated at the end that the group's inspection period in the motherland is scheduled for two weeks. They plan to stay in Shanghai for one or two days, and on the morning of the 28th, they will pay a visit to Mayor Wu, and visit various constructions in the city center, as well as various cultural, industrial and commercial, and transportation agencies in the city. Then, they will go to Beijing to pay a visit to the authorities. After the inspection in Beijing is completed, they will travel along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway to Zhenjiang, Suzhou, and Wuxi for sightseeing. After returning to Shanghai, they will go to Hangzhou. As for Tianjin, Hankou, Jiangxi, Jiujiang, and other places, the members of the group will go to inspect separately, and they hope to go to Xiamen on the 14th of next month. Most of the members of the group are from Xiamen, Fujian, and they have not returned to their hometown for more than ten years, so they plan to take the opportunity to return to their hometown to visit their elders.</p>
<p>List of Group Members</p>
<p>The Philippines Overseas Chinese Inspection Group to the Motherland has eighteen members: Group Leader Wang Quansheng, members Cai Enzhi, Chen Zhongtai, Su Shengsheng, Chen Muhua, Su Bihui, Chen Mingde, Wang Lixuan, Wang Qiulai, Su Yanfu, Zheng Hanrong, Zheng Jiancai, Ye Yifu, Ye Jiadun, Wu Zeshi, Wu Yongdu, Ke Xiaoxiao, and Chu Songtian.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Entertainment</p>
<p>After the group arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, they rested in their residence in the morning due to the fatigue of the journey. In the afternoon, they went out to visit relatives and friends in Shanghai, and freely visited various roads and city conditions. At 7:00 PM, they attended a banquet hosted by the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau at the New Asia Hotel, including Group Leader Wang Quansheng and all the members of the group, Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau Jian Jinglun, Huang Jianzhong of the Overseas Chinese Federation, and dozens of others. During the banquet, Chairman Jian Jinglun first gave a welcome speech, followed by a reply from Group Leader Wang Quansheng, explaining the purpose and hope of returning to the country for inspection, and reported on the situation of Overseas Chinese in the Philippines, and the recent trends in Sino-Philippine trade. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves until about 9:00 PM before dispersing.</p>
<p>Visit to the Mayor</p>
<p>All members of the group are scheduled to go to the city center at 10:00 AM today, led by Group Leader Wang Quansheng, and accompanied by personnel from the Overseas Chinese Federation and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau, to visit Mayor Wu and visit various new constructions in the city center. At 11:00 AM at noon, they will attend a banquet hosted by the New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory at the Jinlong Restaurant. In the afternoon, they will visit the Overseas Chinese Federation, the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and other agencies and organizations, as well as leaders from all walks of life. At 7:00 PM in the afternoon, they will attend a banquet hosted by Legislator Lin Baisheng. Tomorrow, they will visit various transportation, cultural, industrial, and commercial organizations and factories in the city. They are scheduled to go to Beijing within the day to visit the central authorities.</p>
<p>Public Banquet by Organizations</p>
<p>Various organizations in the city, such as the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Bankers Association, the Overseas Chinese Federation, the Chinese Cultural Association, and the Guangdong, Fujian, and Ningbo native place associations, are currently preparing a public banquet for the group to warmly welcome them. The date of the public banquet will be determined after consultation with the group.</p>
<h3>Eurasia Aviation Corporation Plans to Open the Yunnan-Guizhou Air Route. Li Jingcong is Scheduled to Go for Inspection in Mid-Next Month and Actively Plans to Realize Direct Air Service Between China and Germany.</h3>
<p>After the Shaanxi-Yunnan air route was officially opened on the first of this month, the Ministry of Communications considered its business to be fairly developed. Currently, there is no air route from Kunming to Zhucheng, Guizhou. Therefore, last week, it ordered the Eurasia Aviation Corporation to open a new air route from Kunming to Zhucheng to facilitate transportation. After receiving the order, the company considered that the weather in Guizhou and Zhucheng is unpredictable. For the sake of prudence, it plans to send personnel to conduct an on-site inspection first, select an appropriate air route, and then send aircraft for a test flight. It immediately submitted this intention to the Ministry of Communications to request a two-month extension to allow for full preparation, which has been approved by the Ministry of Communications. Li Jingcong, the general manager of the company, plans to depart from Shanghai by plane in mid-next month, accompanied by He En, the head of the agency's flight group, and Liao Guanxuan, the head of the operations group, to inspect the Shanghai-Xinjiang, Shaanxi-Sichuan, Shaanxi-Yunnan, and Lanzhou-Baotou routes. Then, he will transfer from Kunming to Zhucheng for inspection. As for the Peiping-Guangdong air route, it was suspended last summer and the plan was changed to fly from Peiping to Zhengzhou only. The Hankou and Changsha stations are not flying. Recently, there have been no preparations to resume the service. Regarding the company's main route, the Sino-German air route, although it has not been realized in the past three years due to the obstruction of the Xinjiang authorities, the company has been planning for the opening of the route at all times.</p>
<h3>China Ship Insurance Joint Association Underwrites Insurance for Giant Ships. The British Ship Queen Mary, Our Country Also Reinsures the Hull</h3>
<p>Since the French Post Company completed the 70,000-ton large mail ship Normandie last year, the British Cunard Line has also built the 73,000-ton giant mail ship Queen Mary, which sails the Atlantic Ocean from New York in the United States to Southampton in England. After the completion of the ship, it is the largest, most modern, and fastest mail ship in the world, traveling 37 nautical miles per hour. If it is running at full power, it can travel 40 nautical miles, almost as fast as a train on land. The electrical wires used on the entire ship can pass through the Pacific Ocean with plenty to spare. Its magnificence can be called unprecedented. The patterns used in the main halls of the ship were collected and selected from the art world around the world. It has now been fully completed and will begin sailing next month. In Shanghai, the company has established an Eastern Office in the Sassoon Building to attract passengers from the Far East. The cost of the ship's construction, the hull alone, is more than £10 million. Adding the internal equipment, the cost is even greater. In addition to the major British and American insurance companies underwriting the hull insurance, because the insured amount is too large, a portion of the hull insurance has been transferred to our country's insurance companies for underwriting. The China Ship Insurance Joint Association in this city is the largest group in China for insuring ships, with strong capital and the best credit. The giant ship in China is underwritten by the association, and the association has officially accepted it.</p>
<h3>China Communications and Other Banks Discussed Jointly Handling Silkworm Cocoon Purchasing and Lending. A Concrete Plan Will Be Discussed Again Today. Tang Shoumin and Others Visited Minister Wu to Report.</h3>
<p>China Communications, Shanghai, and other banks jointly handled this spring's silkworm cocoon purchasing and lending. The plan has been drafted and completed. The meeting was not successful yesterday, only exchanging views. Another meeting is scheduled for today. It will be implemented immediately after it is passed. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Joint Lending</p>
<p>China, Communications, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang Xingye, and other five banks, upon the request of Jiangsu and Zhejiang silk merchants' representatives Chu Huiseng, Shen Huachen, and others, decided to jointly handle this spring's silkworm cocoon purchasing and lending, and solicited cooperation from other banks. In addition to the above five banks, China Farmers, Jincheng, Dalu, Zhongnan, Salt Industry, Jiangsu Farmers, Zhejiang Industrial, Zhejiang Local, and other banks have also joined. The silkworm cocoon purchasing and lending plan has been drafted and completed, and Song Hanzhang, General Manager of the Bank of China, and Tang Shoumin, General Manager of the Bank of Communications, visited Minister of Industry Wu Dingchang to ask for instructions.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Meeting</p>
<p>China Communications and other banks held a joint meeting at the Bank of Communications yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM to discuss the specific plans for this spring's silkworm cocoon purchasing and lending. Due to other matters temporarily, the number of attendees was insufficient, so the meeting was changed to a discussion meeting, only exchanging views. It was decided to hold another meeting at the same place at 3:00 PM this afternoon. The notice was issued by the Bank of Communications last night. The joint lending plan will be implemented immediately after it is passed.</p>
<p>Lending Plan</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice Society learned from the silk industry yesterday that the joint lending plan of the Bank of China and other banks stipulates that all silk manufacturers, after being registered and approved for silkworm cocoon purchasing, may apply to the joint banks for loans. Approximately 30% collateral and reliable guarantors are required, and the interest rate is approximately 8% to 10%. At the same time, all silk factories may also jointly borrow money from the bank, with all the silkworm cocoons received as collateral, for a period of three to six months.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Industry's Fishery Protection Fleet is Transferred to Zhejiang Province for Use. The Office is Ordered to Handle the Closing. Zhejiang Province Sends Personnel to Shanghai to Take Over.</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Ministry of Industry's Fishery Protection Office has been approved by the Executive Yuan to close down. All of the office's fishery protection fleet has been transferred to the Zhejiang Provincial Government for use. The office received an order from the Ministry of Industry yesterday to begin closing down. The Zhejiang Provincial Government has also sent personnel to Shanghai to discuss the fleet takeover. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry considered the fisheries of the coastal areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to be extremely important. Therefore, in the 17th year of the Republic of China (1928), the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Administration Bureau was established in Shanghai. Due to the lack of results over the years, and due to environmental factors, the successive directors felt that it was difficult to handle affairs. Later, the ministry sent Yuan Lianghua to succeed as director. Yuan's handling of fishermen's safety was very effective. Subsequently, the ministry reorganized the bureau into the Fishery Protection Office, and Yuan was still appointed as director, in order to specialize in the protection of fishermen. Director Yuan supervised the fleets, patrolling the waters of Jiangsu and Zhejiang at any time, and defended day and night during the fishing season. Therefore, in recent years, the fishing area has gradually become peaceful, and the fishermen have benefited greatly.</p>
<p>Ordered to Close</p>
<p>This time, in order to save expenses, the Ministry of Industry, and because most of the fleet defense areas of the Fishery Protection Office are in the waters of Zhejiang, negotiated with the Zhejiang Provincial Government and agreed to transfer the ministry's original fleet to the Zhejiang Provincial Government for use, and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for approval. The ministry ordered the office to close down yesterday. After receiving the order, Director Yuan immediately ordered the internal staff to comply with the closing. It is expected to be completed by the beginning of next month and reported to the ministry for record.</p>
<p>Handover Within Days</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government, because the Ministry of Industry's Fishery Protection Office has been ordered to close down, and the waters of Zhejiang are in the fishing season, the prevention work in the fishing area cannot be stopped for a day, sent Ling Xiao to Shanghai to negotiate with Yuan on the takeover matters. Within days, the Fishery Protection Office will transfer the Haihong, Haiying, and Haigu ships to the Zhejiang Provincial Government so that they can be directly commanded by the Zhejiang Provincial Government.</p>
<h3>Huang Chaolong Went to Beijing Yesterday to Present a Memorial on the Method of Unified Trade Between China and India</h3>
<p>Huang Chaolong, chairman of the Surabaya Chamber of Commerce in Nanyang, went to Shanghai to investigate domestic industries and pay respects to the authorities, and to present a memorial on the method of unified trade between China and India. He has been warmly welcomed by the industrial and commercial sectors. He has now completed his visit to various factories and is scheduled to take a train to Beijing yesterday morning with Gao Shiheng, who is going to Nanyang to investigate commerce, to pay respects to various ministries of the central government and present his opinions. According to Huang's statement to a reporter from the New Voice Society, the import restriction conditions implemented by the Javanese government are extremely harsh. The method is based on the number of imports from each import merchant before the announcement of the Restriction Law, and is set as the annual import permit for each merchant. Imports exceeding this amount are not allowed, and most of the general importers are in the hands of Dutch merchants. As a result, Chinese merchants feel great pain. Huang believes that the government should negotiate with the Dutch government through diplomatic channels, hoping that Chinese and Indian import and export trade will be mutually adjusted. In other words, if the Dutch goods import a certain amount, the Chinese goods can export a certain amount, then both parties will benefit. Recently, the China National Industries Foreign Trade Association has an Nanyang inspection group. In order to discuss and connect with the authorities, Gao is specifically accompanied to Beijing to present opinions to the Ministry of Industry and other agencies.</p>
<h3>Shanghai County Government Ordered to Strictly Eradicate Rice Stem Borer Eggs. All Men and Women Over Ten Years Old are Mobilized. Selling a Pot of Tea is Punished by Paying 1,000 Rice Stem Borer Eggs.</h3>
<p>Rice stem borers are extremely harmful to crops. The only way to prevent them is to remove the eggs every year. However, most farmers inherit the old superstitious concept of natural disasters and lack understanding of pests. Even if local agricultural agencies guide and persuade them, it is rarely effective. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has formulated methods and ordered all counties to supervise the removal of eggs in a thorough manner. In the future, rice stem borer damage may be eradicated. The methods are recorded as follows: All farmers, regardless of gender, over the age of ten, in the egg-collecting implementation area, are fully mobilized. The egg-collecting period is from August 8th to 20th, every day at 11:00 AM. The egg-collecting quantity is at least 50 egg masses per person per day. Those who collect more will be rewarded, and those who collect less will be fined double the number of eggs. The egg-collecting method is to combine 100 pieces of rice leaves with egg masses into a bundle and submit them to the township office or elementary school on a daily basis. Farmers who do not work hard to collect eggs and have been punished will not be allowed to report disasters or receive relief this year. All tea houses are closed during the egg-collecting period. Those who sell tea will be fined 1,000 egg masses per pot. In addition to sending instructors to provide on-site guidance, the supervision method also includes contacting the police every day to go to the countryside to supervise. It is heard that the Shanghai County Government will comply with the order.</p>
<h3>Japanese Embassy Military Attaché Kita to Go to Beijing Tonight. Stays in Beijing for Three Days to Visit the Authorities. Hosted a Reception for Japanese Officials and Overseas Chinese Last Night.</h3>
<p>The newly appointed military attaché of the Japanese Embassy in China, Seiichi Kita, has been in Shanghai for more than a week. He initially stayed at the Towa-kan on Bund Road and has now moved to the official residence on Wuding Road. He was originally scheduled to go to Beijing the day after tomorrow, but according to news from the Japanese Embassy yesterday, Kita has decided to advance his trip and will leave Shanghai for Beijing on the 11:00 PM express train tonight, accompanied by the assistant military attaché Utsunomiya, to pay respects to Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang, Minister of Military Administration He, and other authorities as the first courtesy visit upon arrival. He is scheduled to stay for three days and leave Beijing on the evening of May 1st to return to Shanghai. At 7:00 PM last night, Kita specifically hosted a banquet at the Japanese Club on Bund Road to entertain colleagues from the Japanese Embassy and leaders of Japanese overseas Chinese (yesterday's newspaper mistakenly reported that he was entertaining Chinese and Japanese officials). Attending were Minister Counselor Wakasugi of the Japanese Embassy, Secretary Horiuchi, Consul General Ishii and all staff members below, as well as Gan Nong, head of the Japanese Residents Association, Miri, chairman of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce, Yamamoto, director of Mitsui &amp; Co., and many others.</p>
<h3>New Life Movement Inspection Group Hosted a Tea Party for the Press Yesterday. Scheduled to Inspect the Municipal Party Headquarters Today. Mayor Wu is Scheduled to Host a Banquet for the Group on the 2nd.</h3>
<p>The work of the New Life Movement General Association Inspection Group in Shanghai is about to come to an end. They will soon advance along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. Wu Tiecheng, the instructor of the Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association, and Qian Dajun and Liu Xiang, the chief and deputy heads of the General Association Inspection Group, specifically hosted a tea party for reporters from various newspapers and news agencies in the city at the YMCA in the Eight Immortals Bridge yesterday afternoon in order to exchange opinions on promoting the New Life Movement. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Reporters</p>
<p>Those who attended included Wu Tiecheng (represented by Pan Gongzhan), instructor of the New Life Movement Promotion Association in the city, Pan Gongzhan, and Li Dachao, and other cadres of the New Life Movement Association, Yan Baohang, Ma Enbo, and others from the New Life Movement General Association, Liu Xiang, Zhang Yuchong, Chen Cong, Duan Kewen, and others from the New Life Movement Inspection Group, Ma Yinliang, Zhang Jiluan, Li Haoran, Jin Huating, Wang Wenbin, Li Zikuan, Johnson, and other Chinese and foreign reporters from various newspapers, more than 100 people.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>Around 4:00 PM, everyone took their seats for tea and snacks. First, Chairman Wu Tiecheng (represented by Pan Gongzhan) gave a speech, briefly stating that the New Life Movement Inspection Group's inspection in Shanghai is about to come to an end. Mayor Wu, Chief Qian, Deputy Chief Liu, and others specifically jointly hosted this tea party for comrades in the press in order to seek criticism and opinions from the press in the city, hoping that everyone would express their opinions so that the New Life Movement could be promoted more easily.</p>
<p>Liu Xiang's Speech</p>
<p>Next, the chairman introduced Deputy Chief Liu for a speech. Liu briefly stated that the group's stay in Shanghai for inspection was not long, and the number of people was small. Shanghai has a large population, a special environment, and a complex society, so of course it cannot be detailed. However, the purpose of the group's visit to Shanghai for inspection is, on the one hand, to investigate and survey the living conditions of the general society, and on the other hand, to assist the city in promoting the New Life Movement. Attention should be paid to whether the lives of civil servants are in line with the spirit of the New Life Movement, and whether the general public's understanding of society is thorough. However, the press is a long-term inspector, so it is hoped that they can constantly urge civil servants to implement the New Life Movement, so that they can achieve twice the result with half the effort. Moreover, the press is a social leader. I hope everyone will work hard for the New Life Movement.</p>
<p>Ma Enbo's Speech</p>
<p>Next, the chairman introduced Ma Enbo, a westerner and instructor of the General Association, to give a speech. Ma gave a speech in English, briefly stating that the importance of the New Life Movement has been agreed upon by people all over China and in friendly countries. However, the detailed rules for the promotion of the New Life Movement must be re-evaluated, what the government should do, what the people should do, and what the New Life Movement Association should urge the government or the people to implement. If so, the success of the New Life Movement can be expected soon.</p>
<p>Yan Baohang's Speech</p>
<p>Next, Yan Baohang, Secretary-General of the New Life Movement General Association, reported on the past two and a half years since the establishment of the association and the current achievements, and explained the meaning of the New Life Movement, briefly stating that the association has 25 provinces and cities, 2,321 counties, 10 railways, and 12 New Life Movement Associations have been established where overseas Chinese gather. There are more than 100,000 members of the labor service groups in each place. In terms of participation in action, it has been promoted from land to sea routes. State-run shipping companies such as China Merchants, and private shipping companies such as Dada and Datong, have all promoted the New Life Movement, and have achieved considerable results. They are currently in the process of promoting the New Life Movement to foreign companies such as Taikoo and Jardine, and the realization period should not be far away. The situation at the various wharves is also very different from before. It can be seen that the initial results of the New Life Movement, in terms of spirit, have changed the decadent habits and filled them with vitality. As for the meaning of the New Life Movement, it is to meet the needs of the times and the environment, and it is not to restore the old ways or reverse the course of history. It is also not that the new life only relies on walking on the left and buttoning buttons. Some people think that people who cannot live cannot implement a new life. It should be known that if a person's life only has food to eat, it cannot be considered a complete solution. The New Life Movement is to solve other cultural, educational, and other aspects of life besides the bread problem, and help them solve the bread problem. The New Life Movement is also not an anti-foreign movement, but a basic work of self-improvement. The association opposes only propaganda without work, and propaganda without work. The association does not want to put up slogans, because it has now reached the era of physical practice. Finally, Zhang Jiluan and others successively contributed opinions, and the chairman relayed the request of Chief Liu to publish special issues of the New Life Movement Inspection in major newspapers on a regular basis. It was already six o'clock, and the official announced the adjournment.</p>
<p>Inspection of the Party Headquarters</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the group, it has been decided to inspect the Municipal Party Headquarters today (28th). Mayor Wu is scheduled to host a banquet for the group at the Municipal Government at noon on the 2nd of next month. Around the 5th, they will leave Shanghai and depart along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway to various counties in Jiangsu and Zhejiang to continue the inspection and assist in promoting the New Life Movement.</p>

<h3>Hankou Chamber of Commerce Appeals for Extension of Silver Coin Exchange Period, National Federation of Chambers of Commerce Cables Ministry of Finance</h3>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce yesterday cabled the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, stating: "To the esteemed Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, We have received a telegram from the Hankou Chamber of Commerce, which states: 'Regarding Instruction No. 1609, dated April 22nd of this year from the Hankou Municipal Government, which states: "Received the Ministry of Finance's *Xiaoqian* telegram of April, 25th year of the Republic, stating: 'The Ministry has entrusted the various provincial and municipal governments to handle the collection and exchange of silver coins and silver bullion within their jurisdictions, to be exchanged for legal tender (法幣) at the nearest three banks. The deadline for this exchange, according to Article 1 of the Regulations for Exchanging Legal Tender, was originally February 3rd, 25th year of the Republic. However, to facilitate exchange for people in remote inland areas, it was extended by three months to May 3rd. We have reported this via *Maqian* Shanghai telegram and *Xianqian* telegram. Subsequently, the three banks submitted a letter outlining feasible plans for promoting the collection of cash using legal tender, and after verification, items one and three were deemed feasible. Furthermore, upon receiving a letter from the Central Bank requesting that each provincial government be informed that the merits and demerits of each county's handling of cash coin exchange should be clearly defined and included in the county magistrate's performance evaluation report to the Ministry, we have issued successive instructions and requested that they be followed. Now, considering that the extension for exchanging legal tender to May 3rd is fast approaching, all silver coins and bullion held by people in various regions should be exchanged for legal tender in accordance with the regulations for use. However, we are concerned that people in remote areas may not fully understand the monetary policies and exchange deadlines, and may not promptly bring their silver for exchange, leading to violations of regulations after the deadline. We request that each provincial government re-issue circular telegrams to their subordinates, immediately re-instructing district, town, and village chiefs to inform the people that if they have silver coins or bullion, they must comply with the deadline to exchange them for legal tender. Meanwhile, public announcements should be issued to inform the public, demonstrating compassion and benefiting monetary policy. In addition to issuing circulars, a special telegram is sent to request review, action, and reply as appropriate." We have received this instruction and, in addition to issuing public announcements and circulars, we hereby instruct your Chamber to comply and to inform the members of your Chamber of Commerce and Industry to comply accordingly.' We note that since the Central Government implemented currency control and prohibited the use of hard currency, the collection and exchange of silver coins and bullion has indeed considered the people's plight and extended the deadline repeatedly, now to May 3rd of this year, which is fast approaching. However, the situation in the commercial sphere makes it difficult to complete the collection within the deadline. This is because large amounts of silver coins are within the scope of banks and money shops, which will certainly have already exchanged them for new currency. However, ordinary merchants and people have only small, scattered amounts, neither for trading nor hoarding, and they do not usually pay attention to them. Once the deadline passes and they use them, they will be subject to the sanctions of stringent laws. Considering human nature, there is a feeling of not being able to avoid being penalized at any time. Moreover, if military and police agencies handle this case, they may not follow legal procedures, causing everyone to feel insecure. This is true even in major cities. As for remote areas, transportation is obstructed, and simple men and women follow old habits. Although the documents on currency reform have been repeatedly issued, the mindset of valuing silver and devaluing paper money cannot be changed by any means. With such a short deadline, collection will be difficult. If this is included in the county magistrate's performance evaluation, it may encourage the extortion of clerks and runners. After all, those who possess valuables invite trouble, and ignorant commoners may be arbitrarily extorted. Even a small amount of one yuan or half a tael can lead to bankruptcy and ruin. Policies intended to benefit the people may instead harm them. This is not an over-exaggerated concern, but rather a common practice. Furthermore, in recent years, banditry and floods have bankrupted rural areas, with the rich declining and the poor becoming displaced. There is no longer the leisurely burying of cash as in the past. All that ordinary people have for daily expenses is necessities such as clothing and food. The collection of cash cannot be achieved quickly and needs to be done gradually. We hope that your esteemed association will unanimously advocate for an extension of the deadline to provide relief. We have received this instruction and hereby submit this to your Ministry for review and approval to extend the deadline for exchanging silver coins, which we earnestly pray for.</p>
<p>Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China, respectfully bows."</p>
<h3>Telephone Subscribers Express: "Rather Disconnect Than Pay More" - Taihexiang and Others Write to the Telephone Problem Committee, Hoping to Inform All Subscribers to Advocate for a Unified Stance</h3>
<p>"The issue of telephone rate increases in the Special District has been dragging on for months. Although various parties have consistently advocated against it, a resolution has not been reached. Subscribers such as Taihexiang on Zhoushan Road and Wan Chang on Dongxi Huade Road, jointly wrote a letter to the Special District Telephone Problem Committee yesterday, stating: 'To the esteemed Committee, we are sending the final notice from the telephone company. This is a touchstone for whether your committee and subscribers are united. After receiving this letter, it would not be difficult for us telephone subscribers to pay the fees in full to avoid the inconvenience of disconnection. However, for the benefit of all subscribers and in consideration of your committee's past efforts, we cannot pay alone and bring shame upon your committee. We are willing to make sacrifices first to support your committee's position. Until the dispute over rates is resolved, we will not pay, even if it means disconnecting our telephones and suffering business losses. We hereby inform you of this and request that all subscribers be notified to take a unified approach. Respectfully.</p>
<p>Additionally, Zheng Xiuzhen on Fuxu Road and Tianhexing on Maba Road, also wrote to the committee, stating: "To the esteemed Committee, after reading today's (i.e., the 24th) report on the telephone rate increase issue, we deeply admire your fair stance. We hope to be informed of the progress of negotiations, and we subscribers will quietly abide by your decisions.'"</p>

This initiative by the Society has significant meaning for popularizing general aviation awareness. The Society's sightseeing flights are long-term, with people able to sign up and pay five yuan at any time for an immediate flight. Anyone interested in taking a flight to experience the scenery from the air should take advantage of the beautiful spring weather and contact the Society as soon as possible."</p>

<h3>National Goods Factory Federation Requests Exemption from Sales Tax on Exhibition Items - Manufacturers Participating Not for Profit, Jiangxi Province's Violation of Original Agreement Difficult to Endorse</h3>
<p>"The Shanghai National Goods Factory Federation received a letter yesterday from the Hangzhou Zhejiang-Jiangxi Special Products Joint Exhibition Office stating that the Jiangxi Provincial Government intends to levy a sales tax of one percent on the value of goods from various factories to cover venue expenses. After receiving the letter, the Federation believed that this action by Jiangxi Province violated the principle of unified tariffs and was difficult to endorse. It immediately sent a letter requesting an exemption to maintain the national goods movement. The original letter stated: 'We have received your letter No. 188 dated April 27th, stating that the Jiangxi Preparatory Office has changed the collection of venue fees to 5% of the value of goods sold. We have telegraphed for consultation and request a review and reply. We promptly submitted this to the Standing Committee for discussion, and it was decided that the venue fee for each room at the Zhejiang pre-exhibition was 30 yuan, and the venue fee for each room at the Nanchang exhibition was 20 yuan. We were instructed to follow the letter and have already collected the fees from participating manufacturers during registration, and it would be inappropriate to change them now, which would result in significant losses. The temporary venue fee, in other words, is rent. It has never been heard of to collect rent equal to 5% of the sales price. Furthermore, participating manufacturers in the national goods exhibition sacrifice transportation costs and sell their products at cost for the sake of national goods promotion, not for profit. In previous national goods exhibitions held by the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Railways, and the provincial governments of Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Jiangsu, Shandong, Hebei, Zhejiang, and various cities and counties, numbering in the dozens, the Ministry of Industry issued tax exemption certificates and discounted shipping vouchers for ships and railways. Not only were customs duties waived on exports, but all local taxes were also waived. The Jiangxi Provincial Government is holding a grand product exhibition to commemorate the opening of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and is soliciting participation from Hangzhou and Shanghai national goods manufacturers. The manufacturers are participating despite cost considerations to support the grand event. How can the provincial government violate the agreement by levying these small taxes and losing credibility with merchants? We request that the Jiangxi Provincial Government maintain the original agreement and waive all taxes to maintain the national goods movement. Since the imposition of tariff autonomy and the abolition of *lijin*, national goods transported to various provinces are exempt from all taxes except for the original consolidated tax. Guangdong Province levies sales tax on imported foreign goods, while national goods are exempt. If Jiangxi adopts the method of levying sales tax on national goods, it would be equivalent to reviving *lijin* and violating the government's principle of unified tariffs. Our federation cannot comply with this. Whether to participate in the Jiangxi exhibition should be decided by the manufacturers' representatives themselves.' The record is on file. We hereby forward the record and request your review, hoping that you will maintain the original agreement and strive to uphold the national goods movement."</p>

<h3>Rickshaw Pullers' Welfare Association Held Preparatory Meeting Yesterday - To Formulate Regulations on Theft and Vehicle Insurance</h3>
<p>"Registered rickshaw pullers petition the Ratepayers Association again. The Rickshaw Pullers' Welfare Association held its first preparatory meeting yesterday. The Rickshaw Pullers' Union issued a statement for rickshaw puller registration. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>First Preparatory Meeting of Rickshaw Pullers' Welfare Association</p>
<p>The preparatory committee of the Shanghai Rickshaw Pullers' Welfare Association convened its first preparatory meeting yesterday. More than ten preparatory committee members, including Zhang Zhenshan, Qin Yizhou, Fu Huanzhang, Wang Degao, and Yuan Guilin, were present. Zhang Zhenshan was elected chairman, and the meeting began with formalities. The chairman reported on the process of initiating the organization of the welfare association, and then the following cases were discussed:</p>
<p>1. How to handle the association's location? It was resolved that the association's location should be in the Nanyang Bridge area in principle, and Zhang Mingzhi, Jia Rongzhang, and Qin Yiqing were appointed to be responsible for handling it.</p>
<p>2. How should the association's funds be raised? It was resolved that the income of rickshaw pullers is very low and cannot bear the burden, and the responsibility will be divided among the contractors in each district.</p>
<p>3. The issue of soliciting supporting committee members and members? It was resolved that: (A) Supporting committee members should be solicited separately by each preparatory committee member. (B) Members should be solicited by the Rickshaw Pullers' Association, and the solicitation method will be determined separately.</p>
<p>4. The association should first carry out work to protect rickshaw pullers according to actual needs. It was resolved that rickshaw pullers often have their vehicles stolen, violate police regulations, or are hit by cars, and they cannot afford it. It was decided to first launch two projects: rickshaw theft insurance and vehicle safety insurance. As soon as the methods are formulated, they will be started.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Pullers' Union Issues Statement for Registered Rickshaw Pullers</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of rickshaw puller registration, the Special District Rickshaw Pullers' Union issued a statement yesterday, stating: 'It has been found that there are approximately 20,000 unemployed rickshaw pullers in the city, but the Vehicle Management Committee only allows 5,000 people to register, which has caused a serious dispute that has not been resolved to date. The Vehicle Management Committee's reason for restricting the number of rickshaw pullers to 5,000 and not following the registration of taxi drivers, which requires vehicle companies to introduce advances and retreats, is twofold: first, to prevent rickshaw pullers from competing due to oversupply; second, the relationship between rickshaw owners and rickshaw pullers is a rental relationship, not an employment relationship. Once unrestricted registration is allowed, following the registration of taxi drivers, which is openly advanced and retreated by the vehicle companies, rickshaw owners may enslave rickshaw pullers. Considering the first reason, preventing competition is to protect the livelihood of a portion of the people, but it must be known that registering rickshaw pullers was originally set up to relieve rickshaw pullers, and the fundamental meaning of relieving rickshaw pullers is to allow all rickshaw pullers to be relieved, not to select a portion of rickshaw pullers and then relieve them again. Although the work of rickshaw pullers is inhumane, to prohibit them from doing the work of cattle and horses and to deprive them of their lives, or to take away the work of cattle and horses and force them to die, is not the way to relieve rickshaw pullers. Now, the Vehicle Management Committee restricts the registration of rickshaw pullers, allowing a small number of rickshaw pullers to be relieved, but how will the majority of rickshaw pullers who are unemployed due to not registering be taken care of? We, for the sake of truly relieving rickshaw pullers, dare not agree with this view. The second reason is even more ridiculous. The rickshaw puller is actually a free laborer. Besides paying the legal rent to the vehicle owner, the rickshaw puller has no other obligations. The length of working hours, the amount of work income, and the activity and laziness of work are all the free will of the rickshaw puller, and the vehicle owner has no possibility of coercion, which is more free than ordinary laborers. Regardless of whether the number of registered people is restricted or the taxi driver registration method is followed, the vehicle owner cannot make the rickshaw puller a slave to the vehicle owner. Although the rental relationship is different from the employment relationship, the employment relationship is not a slave relationship. This must be clarified. The various employment natures organized by the Public Works Department, such as taxi drivers who have registered, are not intended to create a slave relationship between the registrant and the employer. Therefore, the registration of rickshaw pullers, even if it follows the taxi driver's unrestricted free registration method, will not fundamentally cause a slave relationship between the rickshaw puller and the vehicle owner. In short, the intention of the Vehicle Management Committee is nothing more than to use this kind of name to reduce the number of rickshaw pullers and vehicles, and to achieve the purpose of eliminating rickshaws. People in the community, please do not be confused by it."</p>
<p>"Preventing Rickshaw Thieves Scheduled to Open Congress Regularly</p>
<p>The Nanshi Rickshaw Pullers Union, because of rickshaw thieves stealing rickshaws diligently, organized a no-redemption group last year to prevent theft, and the Zhabei area also established a no-redemption group this spring for this reason. However, last night, thieves burned two stolen vehicles on Xiahebang, east of Zhengfeng College on Jiaotong Road in Zhabei, leaving only the magnetic plates 2209 to 2229. The union heard the news and requested the Public Security Bureau and the Security Regiment, and then paid close attention to the passing vehicles. According to custom, after being stolen, the vehicle owner and rickshaw puller must prepare 10 yuan to redeem it. Because the industry formed a no-redemption group, the thieves could not cope and came up with this. The union, in addition to submitting to the police and military agencies to request strict arrests, is scheduled to discuss specific countermeasures at the members' meeting on the 3rd of this month (location: Shicaibu of the Nanshi Union)."</p>
<p>"Registered Rickshaw Pullers Petition Ratepayers Association</p>
<p>Registered rickshaw pullers in the Public Concession recently elected Dai Jingqing, Hui Youde, Hu Shaoqing, Tan Zhengyu, Ling Yude, and other five people as representatives to petition the Ratepayers Association, supporting the Vehicle Management Committee's mutual aid association and canceling the unrestricted rickshaw puller registration, so as not to make their lives fall into desperation. The association appointed Mr. Jin Runxiang to receive them, promising to respond before the 25th of this month after the election of the chairman of the Ratepayers Association. The rickshaw pullers, in order to resolve the dispute fairly, again sent Xue Fangde as a representative to carry the petition letter to the Ratepayers Association at 9:30 am yesterday, requesting justice and a satisfactory response in the shortest time."</p>

<h3>Tung Wah Tugboat Hurricane Sinking Tragedy All Seven Crew Drowned, Four Bodies Not Yet Recovered</h3>
<p>The tugboat "Tung Wah" of Wusong Mao and Tug Company was towing a Ningbo wooden sailing boat to import from the sea area of Sanjia Waters outside of Wusongkou at about 4 pm the day before yesterday, and sailed to Paotaiwan. At that time, the southeasterly wind was strong and the waves were monstrous. Somehow, the tugboat was stirred by the wind and waves and capsized, and the entire boat sank immediately. Of the seven people on board, including the captain and sailors, three were rescued by the companion tugboats "Xin Zhen Chang" and "Xin Fei Hua". The remaining four sailors standing on the deck, Qing Sheng, 22 years old, from Shaoxing, and the cook, Bing Kui, 18 years old, from Shaoxing, and A Gen, 27 years old, from Xinchang, in the boiler room, and one temporary worker whose name is unknown, fell into the water with the boat and were tragically drowned. The bodies have not yet been recovered. Zhao Awu, the owner of the small lost boat, is from Pudong. Because the "Xin Zhen Chang" and "Tung Wah" were traveling side by side, there was an unavoidable suspicion of competition. Yesterday, Zhao Awu reported the information to the Fourth Division of the Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol to investigate the circumstances of the loss, to clarify the truth and to value human life.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Public Security Bureau Proclamation Strictly Prohibiting Gambling</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Public Security Bureau issued Proclamation No. 117 of the Fa Department yesterday, stating that gambling is extremely harmful and has been strictly prohibited by repeated orders. Recently, it has been reported in secret that unscrupulous elements in the city are still colluding with public officials to open gambling dens and engage in gambling and extracting commissions, which is extremely hateful. The Director of this Bureau hates evil as an enemy and will eradicate it thoroughly. In addition to ordering subordinates to investigate and arrest them strictly, it is hereby announced to the public so that all citizens are fully aware. In the future, if anyone is found to be gambling and extracting commissions in public places or residential shops, or using their premises to allow others to open gambling dens, they will be strictly investigated and dealt with. If any public officials are found to be taking bribes and shielding them, colluding and acting as accomplices, citizens may report them at any time if they have witnessed or heard of such activities. Once verified, regardless of the official or police officer involved, they will be arrested and severely punished according to the law, without any leniency. All are expected to comply and not violate this proclamation.</p>
<h3>Court Schedules Auction of Xu Qizhong's Property for Next Month The Bankruptcy Trustee Has Notified the Auction House for Assets Such as Cars and Wireless Refrigerators</h3>

<h3>Japanese Sailor Shooting Case Suspects Still Under Investigation Yesterday Continued Hearing Police Have Not Yet Prosecuted Ye Haisheng Appeared in Court With Tears—Court Adjourned to May 1 for Continued Hearing—</h3>
<p>The case of Japanese sailor Nakayama Hideo being murdered on Binle'an Road, after the Public Concession Public Works Department Special Political Department arrested three Cantonese men Yang Wendao, Chen Rongsheng, Ye Haisheng, etc., discovered that Ye etc. possessed firearms and seized various evidence, and sent them to the court requesting detention, etc., has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, it was again the scheduled date for the hearing of this case. It was originally scheduled to be heard by a collegiate panel of the First Special District Court. However, after learning that the police investigation procedures were not yet complete and prosecution could not proceed, the organization of the collegiate panel was cancelled, and Presiding Judge Xiao Xiefei interrogated the case alone. Before the case was opened, the judicial police chief of the First Special Court specially selected six or seven bailiffs to guard the front and rear of the courtroom, and instructed that no one except police personnel should be allowed into the courtroom. No one was allowed to attend the hearing unless accompanied by Chief Clerk Zha Liangjian. The court originally appointed lawyer Fan Gang as the pro bono defender for Ye, Yang, and Chen, but yesterday Ye Haisheng had already appointed lawyer Wang Shizong to defend him. Yang and Chen also jointly appointed lawyer Ge Zhaoji to defend them. At 1:50 PM, the police escorted Ye and others to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court with six Japanese police officers and Chinese and Western detectives. The Public Security Bureau also specially dispatched Huang Hua, the chief of the Third Section, and the Municipal Government specially dispatched Secretary Zhang Tingrong to the First Special Court, accompanied by Chief Clerk Cha to listen to the hearing. The police representative lawyer was Ru Baoyi, and Western lawyer Bolian also attended the court. At 2:04 PM, Presiding Judge Xiao Xiefei and Clerk Ding Zhongnan ascended to the First Criminal Court. Because the police had not filed a public prosecution, only requested an extension of the detention period, the prosecutor did not attend court to perform his duties. Although Lawyer Fan Gang also attended court, he left immediately because the police had not filed a prosecution and there was no need to defend them. After Presiding Judge Xiao interrogated the case in detail for over an hour and forty minutes, at 3:49 PM, he announced that the hearing would be adjourned to the afternoon of the first of next month. When the police escorted the three defendants out of the courtroom that day, the reporter saw Ye Haisheng in tears. A news agency reported yesterday that the hearing was public, so many people went to listen, but they were all turned away from the courtroom. However, according to inquiries, it is feared that prosecution may still not be possible on May 1. As for the situation of the interrogation, after extensive inquiries by reporters, it is known that what was interrogated yesterday was mostly about the witnesses. There was a witness named Zeng Yuan who had been asked by Ye Haisheng to borrow 25 yuan. There was another witness, Zhang Caiyuan, who claimed to have seen Ye on the day of the incident, accompanied by a Korean Jieke and a Korean student whose name is unknown, going north on North Sichuan Road. Not long after, they came from north to south again. He also said that Ye was wearing a Zhongshan suit that day and was not carrying anything in his hands. According to Ye Haisheng's response to the statements of the above two witnesses, Zeng Yuan's circumstances are quite poor, and it is unlikely that he would borrow money from him, and that he himself never wears a Zhongshan suit on weekdays. Yang Wendao said about the English physics and chemistry book that was searched with a gun shape cut out: He always has his own gun to prevent children from playing with it, so he hid it in the book. However, he cannot determine whether the book currently claimed to have been searched. The case was originally intended to be adjourned for two weeks, but for the benefit of the defendant, it was changed to the first day of next month. Whether the hearing will be public at that time depends on whether the police investigation procedures can be completed.</p>
<h3>British Garrison Commander Praises The Effectiveness of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps Training</h3>
<p>After Brigadier General Sackville, the British Garrison Commander, served as the general inspector of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps last Saturday, April 18, Mr. Arnold, the Director-General of the Public Works Department, sent a letter to thank Sackville in the name of the Honorary Commander-in-Chief of the Corps. This has been reported previously. Now, Sackville has replied to Arnold, in addition to praising the neat military appearance during the inspection, he also highly appreciates the daily training of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, saying that this kind of thorough training, coupled with the diligence of the members in studying, to seek the knowledge they should have to cope with emergencies, is indeed extremely satisfactory. Sackville also said that his contact with the Corps is not limited to this one inspection, because he has been present during the Corps' regular training exercises, so what he has seen and heard is more authentic.</p>

Because of their work relationship, Wang Baozhen and him got along very well. They had physical relations in October last year. From then on, they secretly engaged in illicit affairs, and their love reached its peak. Wang's daughter would not marry anyone but Yang, and Yang would not marry anyone but her. Recently, the daughter suddenly became pregnant and was already four months along. On the 29th of last month, the daughter went to her mother to explain that she wanted to marry Yang. However, her mother strongly opposed, saying that she had promised her daughter to the child of her second husband. Seeing this, the daughter left without saying goodbye and went to Yang's place to tell him the reason, unwilling to return to her mother's place. That night, she lived with him in the Tiande Hotel on Dalianwan Road. The next day, she went to Yang's uncle's place for two nights. Because it was not a long-term plan to continue like this, she rented a house and lived together at 7 Mindeeri, Songpan Road.

Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer of the Public Works Department, stated that the vice captain Xue of the Municipal Public Security Bureau was present in court, bringing a genuine passport for comparison with the forged one. The difference is that the seal of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the genuine one is long and the characters are fine, while the forged one is short and the characters are thick. Two forged certificates were seized at Wang's place and stamped with the seal of the Xiamen Public Security Bureau. Later, these people were going to change the handwriting of going to France, and the defendant admitted in the police station that these forged passports were forged by Chen Keming's brother Chen Dahua and others.

His father, Yang Dingzhai, had served as a compradore for the Nisshin Steamship Company. Although his father repeatedly advised him, it was ultimately ineffective. Unexpectedly, on the ninth of this month, Boquan took advantage of the opportunity when his cousin, Zhou Wang, went to Longhua Temple to burn incense, stealing a fixed deposit certificate for 11,000 yuan from Jin Cheng Bank and a current deposit passbook for 2,800 yuan from Qi Ye Bank, as well as pearl hair ornaments and more than ten pearls. He withdrew 2,500 yuan of the deposit. He lost 300 yuan gambling and lent 200 yuan to a friend surnamed Wang. The remaining money and items were hidden in his residence.

<h3>Guo Yingmou: Abandonment Case Concluded After Interrogation, Lu Zhang Testifies Regarding the Moving of Goods</h3>
<p>Guo Yingmou (also known as Guo Yanting), the owner of Guo Baofeng Earthworks in the old schoolyard of the city, was accused by Ge Yunying, a young woman from Cixi, of theft and obstructing family affairs in a private prosecution brought to the Criminal Court of the Local Court. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Judge Zhang reopened the trial. The plaintiff, Ge Yunying, stated that she was 24 years old and had been seduced and raped by the defendant in 1932. Afterwards, he falsely claimed that he had no wife and was willing to have a lifelong relationship with her. Because she was young and ignorant, she fell for his seduction. In 1934, she divorced her former husband, and the defendant rented a house at No. 9, Lane 33, Houjiabang, where they lived together. They later moved to Kaiming Lane in Jiumudi. They lived peacefully as husband and wife for a while. However, on January 8th of this year, the defendant opened room 507 of the Dadafang Hotel and summoned her, claiming that he had urgent business and was going to Nanjing to find his younger brother at the Meifu Oil Company, and promised to return in three days. If he didn't return, she could go to Nanjing to see him. However, he still had not returned by the 12th, so she went to Nanjing but found no trace of the defendant. She immediately returned to Shanghai, but when she arrived home, the movable property in the house was gone. When she asked the landlord, she was told that the defendant had hired people to move it away. When she tried to negotiate with him, he hid and refused to see her. In such circumstances, it is clear that he intentionally stole all of the plaintiff's property and maliciously abandoned her, and she requested that he be brought to justice. Subsequently, the witness Lu Zhang testified regarding the moving of the goods. Finally, Guo Yingmou stated that he was 36 years old and from Guangdong. He admitted to inducing the plaintiff to divorce her husband because he met her while visiting the Great World. She said that she had no husband, only a mother who depended on handicraft work to make a living, and that the family was poor. He took pity on her and rented a house for her, providing her with living expenses each month. Now her attitude has suddenly changed, and she has run away with the belongings, so he took the utensils back and returned them to Zhang Yongxing Wood Shop, from whom he had rented them, etc. At this point, the judge ordered the lawyers from both sides to debate, and then declared the debate concluded and set a date for sentencing.</p>

They are currently engaged in soliciting initiators. Once there are a sufficient number of people, they will immediately apply to the party and government organs for registration. In the future, when realized, united efforts and mutual assistance will surely make a greater contribution to society. It is said that a temporary solicitation office has been set up at No. 622 Zhoujiazui Road, Yu Binqi Chinese Typewriter Factory. Inventors who are listed as initiators can join by sending a letter.</p>

<h3>Doctor Chen Mo Accused of Negligence Resulting in Death after the Death of Wu Zhenglan's Son</h3>
<p>Chen Mo, a pediatrician from Guangdong, 58 years old, resides at No. 221-3 Gansidong Road, where he runs a pediatric sanatorium. He also has clinics at No. 141 Weier Meng Road and No. 977 North Sichuan Road, both of which are quite prosperous. Recently, Qian Wu Zhenglan, a nurse at Wang Qizhang Hospital at No. 28 Ningbo Road in the French Concession, and Qi Peiren, 28 years old, hired a lawyer to file a criminal private prosecution with the Second Special Court against Chen Mo for negligence resulting in death. The court approved the petition, and at 3:00 PM yesterday, Judge Li Changnian presided over the Second Criminal Court. First, the plaintiff stated that the woman's son, named Daosheng, was three years and two months old this year and had been raised by Zhang Wang, a friend in Hengyuan Lane, Belle Road. On the 17th of last month, he suddenly developed a fever and chills. First, Wang Qizhang was asked to prescribe medicine. On the afternoon of the 21st, the fever and chills suddenly increased again. Because Dr. Wang had gone to Hangzhou on business, at 1:45 PM, the woman and Zhang Wang took the child to Dr. Chen's clinic on Xiafei Road to see a doctor. Dr. Chen did not arrive at the clinic until 3:15 PM and then examined the child. Dr. Chen said that it was scarlet fever and that a serum injection was needed. He said that he would inject a bottle of serum into the muscle. In about two minutes, the child's hands started to tremble and white foam came out of his mouth. The woman was shocked and cried bitterly. Dr. Chen still said it didn't matter and gave three more injections of a cardiac stimulant, but it was already impossible to save him. He died in the clinic after a while. Although many people saw it at the time, the woman was in a daze and did not ask for their names, so she could not invite them to testify. However, my child was very lively before he died. At home, he could play ball and swim. In an instant, the defendant misdiagnosed scarlet fever and died from a serum injection. It was truly a case of negligence resulting in death. The woman's husband has been away for three years and has not returned. She only raised this son. She requested that he be brought to justice according to the law and attached a request for 3,000 yuan for upbringing and funeral expenses and 5,000 yuan for consolation money, etc. In conclusion, Chen Mo stated that the plaintiff's child did die in my clinic due to ineffective treatment. That is true, but the facts are not consistent. On that day, I arrived at the Xiafei Road clinic from Gansidong Road at around 2:00 PM and only saw that the plaintiff's child's condition was very severe. It was scarlet fever. At the time, I told her to send him to (Ge Li) Hospital immediately. She said, "Save him, please." I said it would be difficult to save him. She said, "I must save him no matter what." Seeing her repeated pleas, I used serum, but this scarlet fever must be injected with this serum. At that time, only half a bottle was injected. Later, I went to Gansidong Road to see other sick children. When I returned to the Xiafei Road clinic, the plaintiff brought the child back and asked me to save him, so I injected the other half of the bottle. The judge asked what disease it was exactly. He replied that it was indeed scarlet fever, with blue lips, eyes rolled upward, and red spots all over the body. At the time, I repeatedly told the plaintiff to send him to the hospital, and the plaintiff repeatedly asked me to save him. It was really not the doctor's fault. The plaintiff then claimed that the defendant's words were not true. The defendant did not tell me to send him to the hospital. Before the injection, he was quite confident. He said to come back tomorrow for a follow-up visit. It was not until after the injection that his condition suddenly changed. The attorney for the plaintiff then stated that, according to the regulations of the Public Works Department, scarlet fever must be sent to the Public Works Department Hospital for treatment, and other doctors are not allowed to treat it. This point needs to be investigated. Before filing this lawsuit, the defendant had asked a certain doctor to reconcile with the plaintiff, but the plaintiff refused. The judge asked the defendant if any other children had died in his clinic. He replied that, apart from scarlet fever, it often happened. Judge Li ordered that the hearing be rescheduled.</p>

<h3>Report on the Industrial Survey of Guangdong and Guangxi (10)</h3>
<p>— Yang Yan</p>
<p>A Bird's-Eye View of Industries in Guangdong and Guangxi Provinces</p>
<p>The construction of industry in Guangdong is the most important part of its three-year plan, with a total investment of about 40 million yuan in various factories, which shows its ambition. The turnover of its cement plant is about 20 million yuan per year. Any construction in the province must use the products of the state-run cement plant, so its profits can be guaranteed. Last year, it had a profit of 6.3 million yuan. In addition, factories such as sulfuric acid, caustic soda, light gas, fertilizer, cane sugar, papermaking, and beverages have been established one after another, and the Provincial State-Run Products Management Office takes overall charge. The output of sugar is still less than the huge sales volume, and how to make up for it is a matter of much research. The scale of the textile factory is particularly large, with cotton spinning, wool spinning, silk spinning, hemp spinning, and silk weaving, which can be said to be all-encompassing. However, Guangdong does not produce cotton or wool, and cotton and wool spinning are plagued by the lack of raw materials. With the cotton spinning industry in North China and Shanghai already suffering from overcapacity, the construction of this new factory seems to require further study in the overall industrial plan. Judging from its business plan, wool spinning can obtain a net profit of 550,000 yuan per year, and cotton spinning can obtain a net profit of more than 210,000 yuan per year, which may be just an ideal and difficult to achieve in reality. Silk and hemp spinning can be greatly expanded. After the establishment of the hemp bag factory, the hemp planting industry has great potential. Director Feng of the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau has paid attention to this. In short, Guangdong's industry is still based on agriculture. Without more agricultural production, industry cannot be promoted. Without the great development of industry, there is no way out for agriculture. It is heard that in the second phase of Guangdong's three-year plan, in addition to paying attention to heavy industry, there will be a large-scale expansion in agriculture. Recently, Guangdong's agriculture has achieved considerable results under the vigorous management of Director Feng Tixia. The most important work at present is to improve rice varieties. Guangdong imports 19 million piculs of foreign rice a year, which is not a sustainable solution. Therefore, it is necessary to increase rice production to make it self-sufficient. Various rice varieties have been tested and can increase production by more than 40% compared to ordinary rice. Another is to use superior sugarcane varieties. More than 20 varieties of sugarcane have been tested and can increase yield by two or three times and sugar content by more than one time compared to local varieties. In addition, there are concrete plans for preventing cattle plague, improving fruit trees, managing water conservancy, promoting forest reclamation, preventing pests, testing superior tobacco leaves, improving aquaculture, improving agricultural implements, testing superior cotton varieties, and improving pig, chicken, and duck breeds, all of which are being carried out step by step.</p>
<p>In Guangxi Province, farmers account for 80% of the population, and industry is still stuck in the handicraft era. The work is simple and only for use in the province. Recently, the sharp increase in the import of industrial products from home and abroad, which are exquisitely made and sold at low prices, has made it impossible for the province's only handicraft industry to compete with them, and it is in danger of being eliminated. In order to strive for self-sufficiency and save the backward industry, the Guangxi Provincial Government has set up sulfuric acid, tung oil, alcohol, leather making, sugar making, machinery, and printing factories, which are roughly of the scale of modern industry, even though the economy is extremely poor. However, the sulfuric acid and alcohol factories have not properly solved the problems of raw materials and market, and the future is bleak, which is very worrying. The raw materials for sulfuric acid must be supplied from other provinces, and the Guangdong Arsenal is not its customer, so there is no way out. Only the Guixian sugar factory has hope, and the Wuzhou tung oil factory is also developing daily. The leather and printing factories in Nanning have all been visited and are rare in the nascent industry, and the spirit of honesty and hard work of the people in Guangxi is especially admirable and worth emulating. In agriculture, there are active measures for afforestation and water conservancy. The Liuzhou Agricultural Experiment Station is engaged in afforestation and agricultural work and has achieved considerable results. It also set up agricultural demonstration fields in the eight republic district cadre schools, gradually using the results of general field experiments, such as selection, cultivation, fertilization, processing, and feeding, to impart the technology to the militia cadre students through demonstration fields. These students, after leaving school and returning to their hometowns, serve as village chiefs and principals of national elementary schools, and they impart the technology to farmers, which is convenient and easy to promote. In recent years, production has increased daily. Livestock, rice, and tung oil are the main exports. If they can be promoted well and production can be increased, the export volume will increase day by day. Guangxi Province is most lacking in cotton, and cotton cloth and cotton yarn are the main imports every year. Now a cotton cultivation experiment field has been set up to try to restore the original cotton production. Mineral resources and nonferrous metals are quite rich. Coal is available but not abundant. The opened mines, such as tin in Fuchuan, Hexian, Zhongshan, Hechi, and Nandan, tungsten in Gongcheng, Fu, He, and Zhong, antimony in Guixian and Hechi, and gold in Youjiang, Wuming, Shanglin, and Mengjiang, have increased their output year by year. Therefore, although Guangxi Province is known as a poor province, the underground minerals and the agricultural crops on the ground are all sources of wealth. If it can gather technical talents on the one hand and use foreign capital on the other hand to develop them, then after a few years, why is it difficult to turn a poor and barren area into a prosperous province?

<h3>French Business Football Club Challenges Our World Games Team  If It Materializes, They Will Meet at the Shen Garden Tomorrow Afternoon  Shanghai China Team to Go to Nanjing to Perform with the National Army Instead</h3>
<p>The World Games Football Team was originally scheduled to play against the Shanghai China Team at the Shen Garden tomorrow (the 29th).

<h3>Ministry of Education Orders Vocational Schools to Establish School Advisory Committees</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 27th) The Ministry of Education believes that although the number of vocational schools in various provinces and cities has increased compared to the past, the content is not substantial enough. In terms of student morale training, academic subjects, teaching materials, and internship programs, they do not fully meet the actual needs of the vocational industry. To improve this, in addition to raising the standard of school funding and enriching equipment, it is also necessary to connect with the vocational industry to communicate supply and demand opinions, so as to provide reference for training and teaching. It is specially stipulated that vocational schools should establish school advisory committees. Nine articles of the method were issued to all departments, instructing all public and private vocational schools under their jurisdiction to establish advisory committees and hire five to seven experts or leaders from the agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors of the same nature as the school as committee members to handle the following matters: 1. Student service ethics and moral training; 2. Review and selection of vocational subject teaching materials; 3. Guidance and liaison for student internships inside and outside the school; 4. Employment of graduates; 5. Suggestions for other school facilities. If there are vocational schools of the same nature near each school, they may jointly organize an advisory committee and appropriately increase the number of committee members.</p>

<h3>Talking About Education in Extraordinary Times</h3>
<p>— Shao Mingjiu</p>
<p>I would also like to talk about the issue of education in these extraordinary times. I have exchanged views with those currently responsible for educational administrative leadership beforehand, and after repeated consideration, I feel that the focus of this issue is on facts, not theory, and there is no need to sing high-sounding tunes. To be clear, this issue needs to be practical and easy to implement. However, according to my observation, the only way to achieve this is to have all illiterate people across the country consistently and practically engage in literacy, in other words, literacy education. Look at how the central government is now encouraging various localities to promote compulsory education and establish literacy schools, but with few successes and many losses. The reason for this is very easy to understand. In the minds of general educational leaders, attention is always paid to major cities, and they never think of going deep into the countryside. However, in extremely lively big cities, people are most concerned with novel things, which easily cater to the psychology of social figures, and it is also easy for people who are solely after profit to invest heavily in order to engage in profiteering. They have never thought about how literacy education is beneficial to the people and is the fundamental issue for local peace and stability. When I say this, I must declare to big cities, because in big cities, the common habit is that most of the people cannot live without labor. In one day, the so-called minimum is eight hours of work, and more than ten hours or more is not certain. Under the extremely hard living conditions of these working people, if you want to force them to become literate, this method is also not easy to be effective.</p>
<p>What I want to propose now, of course, cannot escape the old cliché, which is to quickly increase the work of literacy and implement it. This sentence, on the surface, seems like a light and bland herbal medicine, very ordinary and extremely common, but those who take it can be sure that it is beneficial and harmless. I will add another sentence to the content of literacy, which is universal literacy education. To put it more clearly, it is what is currently called "education in extraordinary times." The reason why I dare not recklessly talk about what kind of education is most suitable for the current situation and needs of our country is that I think the urgent task in the face of national crisis is still to start with education. The mode of education, I am afraid, cannot be separated from this practical literacy education. To be more specific, the highest education authorities have long realized how to make the elementary education curriculum interconnected and focus on universal nationalization. In the intermediate education stage, they have also mentioned how to shorten the curriculum, concentrate teaching time, and train concrete thinking and thought that is both edifying and creative. As for the trend of higher education, it is also largely the same. His method is very correct, but now our country's education policy is not focused on treating the symptoms, but on treating the root cause. Since the national situation is so urgent to the point of extreme danger, the goals of education naturally cannot be like those of the former German, Japanese, American, or French models. There are also those who promote the Dalton Plan today and switch to project-based teaching methods tomorrow. There are many new names, too many to mention. In short, the tricks change back and forth, but it is still the same set. Regardless of whether it is a Chinese or foreign style, it must take into account the national land, the people's customs, and habits to be correct. Otherwise, everyone will discuss this education in extraordinary times without knowing where to start. In my personal opinion, rather than singing empty tunes, it is better to do practical, simple, and easy-to-implement literacy education.</p>
<p>(Note) Of course, the specific methods for literacy education are not within the scope of this article's discussion. If time permits, I should propose other methods and dedicate them to the education authorities.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Provincial Experimental Elementary School Night Battle</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Provincial Experimental Elementary School in this city established a scout troop this semester, it has paid great attention to training for extraordinary times. The members of the Shangwen Road first branch and Wenmiao Road second branch of the school jointly held a night battle the night before last. The second branch was in charge of defense, and the first branch was in charge of attack. The members of both sides used specially made symbols to represent weapons. The defending side had already carefully hidden the national flag in a difficult-to-find place within the defense zone. The attacking side's goal was to seize the defending side's troop flag. The defending side's goal was to intercept the attacking side's weapons. Individual faculty members of the school served as referees. After the battle order was issued at 7 pm, all the lights in the defense zone were turned off. Both sides used flashlights to rush, attack, defend, and strike in various places until 8 pm, when the ceasefire was announced. It is reported that the school will hold its tenth practice on the evening of May 2nd.</p>

<h3>Securities Yesterday's Opening Auction of June Bonds: Market Transactions Exceptionally Lively; Sharp Rise Followed by Immediate Reaction; All Bonds Unanimously Fell Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange's June futures commenced, with quite lively trading. Types Ding and Bing are scheduled for lottery drawing in early June, so all June futures are "excepted." After days of sharp rises, the market experienced an immediate reaction, with bulls rushing to exit, causing a significant decline. Type A decreased, successively breaking through three record highs. A rapid advance is inevitably followed by a retreat. This is because in recent days, the Sichuan traders have been buying, and general speculators have surged in. Excessive bullish positions have become congested, and any slight movement in the defenses could lead to a collapse. Given the current situation, some bulls are likely to engage in a desperate struggle. Therefore, the future remains uncertain and not to be taken lightly. Yesterday's activity saw the opening price initially set a new record of 64 yuan due to No. 8 buying May Type E. However, after Nos. 10 and 35 sold, the market quickly turned downward, the trend reversed, and confidence waned. Bulls rushed to exit, resulting in a decline of two to four jiao. In the second session, the selling pressure remained unabated, with Nos. 10, 35, and 47 all selling or exiting. Retail bulls also sought to liquidate, causing the market price to fall another three to four jiao. The situation deteriorated further in the afternoon, with the decline intensifying. Type Ding plummeted 8.5 jiao, while others fell by two to six jiao. No. 37 continued to exit. Although there was a slight firmness in Type Bing at the close, it was only due to temporary short covering. The rest still fell by one to three jiao. The sharp rise was followed by a reaction, and further changes are likely in the future. In the end, except for the initial opening of June, May unanimously fell by seven jiao to one yuan and three jiao. The total trading volume was 8,385,000 yuan. A comparative table of the resulting gains and losses is provided below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan). Furthermore, today is the settlement date for April low-term futures, and the market is closed for one day.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Inventory Increases, Urgent Need to Clear; Speculative Short Selling of Cotton Very Active</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to decline, and the downward trend intensified. This is because yarn sales have been sluggish recently, with no interest from buyers. At the same time, yarn inventory in warehouses has continued to increase. As a result, speculative short selling has been very active, but the significant long positions held by the banking sector and the gold trade have not yet exited.</p>
<p>Bidding Prices for Yarn Decline Across All Months</p>
<p>The bidding prices for yarn opened lower across all months yesterday morning, with strong selling pressure. Because longs have been absorbing the trading volume for days, they have already looked saturated. Shorts see waning long intentions and their sales interests are suddenly strong, so the chips in the market have loosened, and market prices have become increasingly untenable. He Xing and Da Feng sold additional volume. Ren Feng's covering of shorts also increased. As a result, bid prices for all months fell by nine jiao to one yuan and two, three, and five jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. The situation in the afternoon opening was still mediocre, and the selling pressure was overwhelming. By the second and third sessions, some profit-takers covered, resulting in a slight rebound. In the end, all months fell by one to two jiao, but rebounded by one jiao, compared to the morning closing price. Da Fu sold 500 bales, Ji Feng 650 bales, Da Feng 1,100 bales, He Xing 1,800 bales, Sen Kang 750 bales, Heng De 550 bales, Yuan Yi 650 bales, Sheng Yuan 1,200 bales, Yong Da 700 bales, Xin Cheng 1,700 bales, and Da Ji 1,900 bales. Ju Xing bought 1,400 bales, Chang Ji 500 bales, Xing Chang 550 bales, Ren Feng 2,450 bales, Tai Chang 850 bales, Run Kang 1,050 bales, Jing Hua 750 bales, Zhen Da 1,300 bales, Shen Ji 900 bales, and Xin Hua 1,150 bales. The daily high, low, and closing prices are listed below.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Also Falls by About One Yuan</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are lackluster. According to statistics, various trading houses bought a total of 555 bales throughout the day, with prices falling by five jiao to one yuan. The buying volumes of various trading houses are as follows:</p>
<p>The cotton market is very weak, and the downward trend is strong. This is because the longs have been holding tight for a long time. Recently, yarn sales have been sluggish, and demand for raw cotton has been very slow. As a result, speculative short selling has been active, and selling pressure has been significant. However, the long positions of Tong Ji have not yet exited and they are still struggling to hold on.</p>
<p>Bidding Prices for Cotton Supply at the 5-Yuan Threshold</p>
<p>The bidding prices for cotton opened lower across all months in the morning. The selling pressure was severe, because shorts believed that the long side's purchasing power after the June term rollover was not strong, so their desire to sell was very strong, and the prices for July and August both broke the 5-yuan threshold. However, the longs at Tong Ji remained unmoved. As a result, prices for all months fell by three and a half to four jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. The momentum in the afternoon opening was still weak, and the selling side continued to exert pressure, with the long side lifeless and sticking firmly to their positions. By the second and third sessions, there was a slight rebound, but prices softened again at the close. In the end, prices for nearby months were unchanged, while prices for distant months fell by one jiao compared to the morning closing price.

<p>Demand for Spot Cotton Still Unsatisfactory for Mills</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption remains sluggish, and mill demand is unsatisfactory. The sources are 390 bales of Yao cotton and 80 bales of Tong cotton.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth Warehouse Cotton Yarn Inventory Increases</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn inventory in the warehouses of the Chinese Merchants Yarn and Cloth Exchange, as of the 25th of this month, totaled 31,180 bales, an increase of 2,180 bales compared to the previous 29,000 bales. Among them, 20-count Red Kui Xing (4,350 bales) and Tian Guan (3,360 bales) brands were the most abundant. The next most abundant were Da Fei Ting, Jin Cheng, Qi Qiu, Jin Ji, and other yarns, with about 2,000-3,000 bales each. The details are listed below (unit: bales).</p>
<p>Demand for American Cotton Spot Goods Is Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened with fluctuations of one to two points per pound across all months. Nearby months were firm due to buying and short covering by traders, while distant months were flat and weak. The weather in the Southwest was uncertain, with possible showers in Arkansas and Oklahoma. Subsequently, there was spread selling in the July contract. There was a lack of off-exchange buyers, and traders were watching cautiously. Spot demand was quiet. Borrowed cotton activity increased in the F.O.B. market. The close was flat and weak. Spot goods rose three points, and futures rose three points to falling six points. English cotton spot goods fell two points, and futures rose or fell one to two points. Indian cotton trading was scarce, and there was a lack of exciting news in the market. The close was firm. Pingguoer fell 0.50 to 1.25 rupees, Aomula rose 0.25 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell 0.25 to 0.50 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 25th).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Mumbai on the 27th, the opening forecast for the July-August Bailuoxi cotton contract was 202 rupees, down 1.25 rupees from the previous day's close.</p>
<p>Three-Grade Yarn Rises, Cotton Flat</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Osaka on the 27th, three-grade futures yarn rose eight jiao to one yuan and five jiao. Nearby months were 198 yuan, and distant months were 198 yuan and one jiao. Futures cotton rose or fell one jiao to three jiao. Nearby months were 64 yuan and nine jiao and five fen, and distant months were 61 yuan and six jiao and five fen.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Sales Market Supply Exceeds Demand; Limited Sales to Anhui and Jiangxi, Remainder Sporadic</h3>
<p>Due to increasingly stagnant demand from various regions, cotton cloth supply exceeds demand, and prices are difficult to maintain. Yesterday, affected by the decline in yarn and cotton prices, prices uniformly fell. Fine cloth and shih cloth fell about one jiao per piece. Eight-pound four plain cloth can be bleached and starched to make foreign yarn to meet summer demand and is usually very strong. However, sales of foreign yarn are now sluggish, and manufacturers are hesitant to produce it, causing the price to fall immediately by 7.5 fen per piece. Fine twill bottom orders are thin, and market prices are barely maintained, but the outlook is very soft. For example, the price difference between spot goods and forward goods of Yang He fine twill has reached one jiao per piece, previously only five fen. Demand from various regions is weak, with only the Nanchang group continuing to buy 200 pieces of fine cloth, fine twill, bleached cloth, poplin, and printed cloth from this factory. The Anhui group bought over 100 pieces of fine cloth and miscellaneous brand fine twill, poplin, and drill from Dasheng Factory and Shenxin Factory. All other transactions were small-scale.</p>
<h3>Grains: Manufacturers Wait and See, Flour Market Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market was generally quiet after the morning opening. Foreign wheat quotations from Chicago fell by two to three jiao, and Canadian wheat fell by one jiao. Market sentiment anticipates that this month is coming to an end, and factories are maintaining market prices, slightly easing pressure. As for forward months, most factories are currently taking a wait-and-see approach, without significant selling. However, the recent weather has been particularly favorable, and wheat seedlings are sprouting quickly. As a result, sentiment has calmed slightly, and prices have fallen by about one fen. When the market opened in the afternoon, transactions were slow, and prices fluctuated only slightly. The trend suggests that a portion of the new wheat harvest must be secured before competition between the two sides can begin.</p>
<h3>Buying Interest in Wheat Futures Increases Slightly - Prices Rebound by One to Two Fen</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market saw little change in the morning opening prices across all months. The June contract opened well, rising to six jiao, then falling back three fen. Other months only fluctuated by one to two fen. When the market opened in the afternoon, due to another cold snap, buying interest improved slightly, and prices for all months rose by one to two fen. In the current situation, both sides are avoiding each other, waiting to see how the new wheat harvest turns out before there can be any significant price movements. The spot wheat market remains unchanged, with Dong Yaowan, Suqian, and Nan Su Zhou wheat quoted at 5.3 yuan. Fuxin bought over 1,000 bags.</p>
<p>American wheat continues to be affected by weather, with scattered showers in drought areas. Buying has not been enthusiastic.</p>
<h3>Speculators Eager to Sell, Regular Rice Continues to Weaken</h3>
<p>Yesterday's regular rice market was flat, weak, and listless. Speculators, seeing that the weather [is getting warmer] and stored rice cannot be kept for long, some are already showing signs of being unable to hold on. With Jiujiang rice arriving steadily and Wenzhou-Taizhou rice (being softer in quality) particularly eager to be shipped and sold, the market saw a few sellers lowering prices to liquidate. Therefore, market prices for all types of rice continued to fall by three to five fen to nearly one jiao. Sales are still limited to this street, and speculators remain cautious. The issue of exempting the full tax on imported broken rice has already been approved for Ningbo merchants, while Shanghai merchants are still applying. It is likely that the precedent will be followed, so the future market situation is temporarily unfavorable.</p>
<h3>Lower Reaches Rice Market Remains Sluggish; Zhongguan Thin Rice Falls by More Than Two Jiao</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, sources from various groups totaled over twenty firms, with a total of over forty shi of goods arriving, mostly thin rice. As a result, the market situation for this type of rice saw Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, and other groups moving two to four hundred bags, but high-grade prices were still discounted, and Zhongguan old stock fell by over two jiao. Although the arrival of thick early japonica rice was scarce, accumulation over the past few days has been quite abundant. Combined with sluggish sales in this street, the market weakened further, falling by another jiao. Du Yang tip rice was down five fen to one jiao, and overcast Yuan rice was flat and weak.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, sources from various lower reaches totaled twenty-six or twenty-seven firms. Sales of various goods on the market remained sluggish. White japonica rice was stable, but old stock was sold at a slightly lower price due to the desire for quick liquidation. Overcast Yuan rice was scarce, and prices were firm. White Yuan scattered goods were still sluggish, and prices fell by another seven or eight fen. Fresh thin japonica rice prices were firm, while lower grades were soft. All tip rice was slightly soft, and other goods were stable.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Soybean Oil Gains Momentum</h3>
<p>The upward trend in soybean oil and peanut oil is quite strong, rising three to five jiao compared to the previous weekend. This is due to the dramatic changes in Dalian and rising production prices. Sales in various regions are booming. Forecasts suggest that the trend will remain firm. As a result, traders are unanimously optimistic. Therefore, the market is generally positive. A total of 1,300 pieces of various types of soybean oil and 850 pieces of peanut oil were opened on the market.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Refined White Sugar Drops One Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market remained sluggish due to stagnant sales, and the market trend continued downward. The association set the price of No. 24 coarse sand white spot at 22 yuan, and transit goods at 6.85 yuan, down five fen. There were no changes in East Red sugar. East White sugar spot goods No. 4 were 21.8 yuan, and No. 8 were 21.45 yuan, both down five fen. No. 9 was 11.3 yuan. There were no changes in transit goods No. 4, 8, and 9. Refined white sugar from local factories was down one jiao. Zhenji No. 1 was 20.5 yuan, and No. 2, 3, 4, and 5 were also down five jiao. Dahua Jinxin No. 1 was 20.7 yuan, with the above all down two jiao. No. 10 goods were not offered.</p>
<p>4,059 bags, Wu Yang coarse white, produced by Dongguan and Shunde factories, were 21.8 yuan. Qu Xi factory's products were 21.6 yuan. No. 2 Cantonese refined white was 21.5 yuan, and No. 4 was 28.8 yuan. Medium sand white was 20.55 yuan. In the end, a total of 921 bags were traded, slightly more than the previous session, with no price changes.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Longkou Vermicelli Shows Slight Rebound</h3>
<p>Longkou vermicelli has recently seen production prices rebound by several jiao, and the market has stabilized. Local customer goods were offered at 23.5 yuan. The market price for northern specifications was 24 yuan, and southern specifications (92 skin) were sold at 23 yuan. After the production telegram reported over 31.8 yuan (per bag), there have been no further reports. However, the Shanghai market has not seen strong sales, making it difficult to improve.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Large Quantities of Sui'an Green Tea Enter the Market</h3>
<p>Large quantities of new Sui'an green tea from Zhejiang Province have entered the market. Previously, the market had become stagnant due to the tea houses suspending trading. It is now reported that over ten tea factories from local villages have arrived with cash to buy, and the market has become active again. Tea prices have risen back to 68 yuan.</p>
<h3>First Batch of Xiaoshan New Tea Arrives, Eight Packages</h3>
<p>The tea factory of the Shanghai Chinese Tea Company received eight packages of new tea from Xiaoshan, Zhejiang Province, yesterday. It is said that Zhuji goods will also arrive in Shanghai within days.</p>
<h3>He Kou Black Tea Harvested Sequentially</h3>
<p>Black tea in He Kou, under the jurisdiction of Qianshan County, Jiangxi Province, has been harvested sequentially from the 21st onwards in tea-producing areas such as Huangyuan and Geyuan. Due to the sunny weather, the tea leaves are of excellent quality. Tea houses have begun to collect new goods in order to start production.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous News: Price of Ordinary Good Ginger Declines Gradually</h3>
<p>Previously, good ginger prices were high, reaching 15-16 yuan, due to limited supply. Recently, the arrival of medium and small goods has gradually increased, but sales have slowed. Additionally, Guangdong traders are occasionally selling at low prices, causing prices to decline gradually. Prices have already fallen by one or two yuan. There are no signs of stabilization for medium and small goods, but large good ginger is relatively stable due to a shortage of inventory.</p>

<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— (Xiao Bai)</p>
<p>"Self-aggrandizement" is bound to lead to failure, but we must "value ourselves."</p>
<p>Self-confidence is more helpful than money, power, family background, or friends. It is the most reliable capital in life. It enables you to overcome difficulties, eliminate obstacles, and move step by step closer to success.</p>
<p>In this world, many people often underestimate themselves, completely obliterating their own potential. They believe that all the happiness others have will never belong to them. They are trapped in the quicksand of fatalism, unaware that they can achieve their goals and win if they actively strive and work hard.</p>
<p>It is said that Columbus's discovery of the New World and Napoleon's dominance over Europe with countless victories were not just due to courage but also to their reliance on self-confidence for their great achievements.</p>
<p>Therefore, the prerequisite for success is strong "self-confidence."</p>
<h3>Manifestations of Inertia</h3>
<p>— Sleeping Buddha</p>
<p>The most common inertia of the Chinese people is manifested unconsciously anytime and anywhere, so if you pay a little attention, you can see it anytime and anywhere. Here, let's write down the two most obvious things that we often feel.</p>
<p>The situation on boats and vehicles everywhere need not be mentioned. Let’s just take the trams that we ride in daily: they already fully show the common characteristic of being lazy and afraid of difficulty. When a tram just stops, people waiting below do not wait for the passengers on the tram to get off, and instead scramble over each other, each wanting to push away the crowd so that they can be the first to rush into the tram car. Can this be called bravery? No! It's nothing more than being afraid of standing for one more moment, afraid of not being able to grab a seat. And of their goals for occupying a seat, nine out of ten focus on the corners of those four seats, so even when there are few passengers, these four corners will not be empty. Their original intention in occupying these corners is so that there can be something to lean on, so that the body can be entrusted to something solid. This way, it will be much easier and more comfortable. So, the people who occupy these four corners stretch out their legs, spread out their hands, and lean their heads and backs diagonally against the backrests. This is not only laziness, it simply completely reveals their "dependence."</p>
<p>It is said that this situation is rarely seen in foreign countries, but in China, it can be said to be commonplace, especially for those of us whose clothes are not neatly dressed. If we enter any business, we have to get a taste of the cold shoulder. For example, when you are choosing goods, because you are not satisfied, you trouble that clerk to take out a few more kinds. One or two times of taking things out for you is still okay, but after the second time, the look of annoyance will float to his face, making you feel a chill. At the same time, the words he says to you will gradually feel like ear pricks. As a result, no matter how much you dislike it, because you are afraid that he will give you a few unpleasant labels, you have no choice but to take out the money to buy it back, preferring to have a few days of unhappiness. However, we must also forgive this, and not blame him for the simplicity and slowness of his service, but blame the inertia that is deeply rooted in everyone's heart, because he himself is also subject to inertia!</p>
<h3>The Legacy of the Unjust Rich</h3>

<h3>Idle Chat While Sipping Tea</h3>
<p>— 19</p>
<p>The use of tea, although it relieves boredom and quenches thirst, also embodies the etiquette of yielding and deference. In the beginning, etiquette was applied to food and drink. When a guest arrived, the host first offered tea, followed by wine, and then food. Therefore, tea is a symbol of respect, and the way etiquette is practiced. Since the time of Lu Tong and Lu Yu, some praised it with songs, while others wrote treatises on it, and tea eventually became a favorite pastime of the leisure class, leading to studies of tea picking, storage, brewing, and more.</p>
<p>Everyone knows about Lu Tong's seven bowls of tea. The tea song praises the wonderfulness of seven bowls: "One bowl moistens the throat; two bowls break isolation; three bowls scour the dry intestines, leaving only five thousand scrolls of writings; four bowls release a light sweat, all the injustices of life dissipate through the pores; five bowls cleanse the muscles and bones; six bowls connect to the immortal realm; seven bowls cannot be drunk, only a clear breeze feels like it's generated under my arms."</p>
<p>Presenting fine teas and competing in drinking is called "tea fighting." Fan Zhongyan has a tea fighting song, likely referring to Wuyi tea. Here is an excerpt from the National Tea section to see the fashion of the time: "... Beiyuan will soon offer tea to the emperor, the heroes under the forest first praise the beauty of the country. The tripod grinds the bronze of the first mountain outside the clouds, and the pot carries the Zhongru water from the river; the green clouds fly by the golden millstone, and the green waves rise in the jasper bowl. Tea fighting is tasteless like light whey, tea fighting is fragrant like thin orchids. How can the grade be deceived? Ten eyes see and ten fingers point. Victory is like ascending to immortality and unattainable, defeat is like a surrendered general with endless shame..."</p>
<p>Brewing tea in a bamboo grove was called a refined affair by the ancients. What is bamboo? A bamboo stove. This style has been around for a while. Emperor Suzong once granted scholar Zhang Zhihe a male and female servant each. Zhihe matched them as husband and wife and named them "Fishing Boy" and "Woodcutter Qing." People asked why. He replied: "Fishing Boy is used to hold the fishing rod and reel, playing the [instrument name]; Woodcutter Qing is used to gather orchids and cinnamon, brewing tea in a bamboo grove."</p>
<p>Zuo Si's poem about his beautiful daughter says: "My family has a good daughter, fair and always white and clear; her nickname is Wan Su, her speech is clear and distinct. She is greedy to run in the wind and rain, suddenly hundreds of times. Her heart is set on the tea burner, blowing and attending to the tripod." Reading this, one can imagine how deeply one can be immersed in tea.</p>
<h3>Tea Picking</h3>
<p>— Ripple</p>
<p>Stretching over dozens of miles of mountains are planted neat rows of tea trees, sprouting tender green buds after being freshly washed by the spring rain.</p>
<p>Groups of two and three young girls gather on these mountains, squatting down and reaching out with their delicate fingers to pick tea buds that look like grains of rice. They also sing natural mountain songs that are very pleasant to listen to, like a nightingale leaving its valley.</p>
<p>Several young men in the market, in this sunny weather, wander around the mountains and fields, admiring this spring countryside scenery: verdant wheat leaves, tender yellow rapeseed flowers, and even peach and rose flowers that are just about to bloom. Only those who live in the countryside can appreciate this poetic and beautiful painting.</p>
<p>These tea-picking women are mostly young girls. Because the women have another textile work, they use the young girls' free time to pick tea. But the thorny roses will also be their livelihood in the future.</p>
<p>The work of tea picking may not seem very strenuous, but if you replaced an older person squatting on the ground for a day, they would not be able to straighten their backs. After picking these tea leaves, they must be carefully and attentively baked by hand at home in order to sell them at a good price.</p>
<p>Every year during the tea season, there is a trade of 300,000 yuan in this small town of Sian. With rural bankruptcy to this point, the tea trade is not without its small benefits.</p>
<h3>The Crane Returns to Its Nest</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 1: Sipping Tea and Making Small Talk, Rain Outside the Night Window in the County; Breaking off Branches, Beautiful Shadows, Fragrant in the Flower Lane</p>
<p>I know that you students in school don't like to hear the phrase "carry on the family line." You think it's old and corrupt. But I said those words in front of your father that year, and I must do it to be worthy of your father. The young man stood up and laughed loudly: Mother has taken the words too seriously. It's just to save on the use of an old nanny, why bring the words so far? While laughing, he stood up and walked towards the hall. The old lady said. Just got home, where are you going? The young man laughed: There are no servants at home, I'll go to the tiger stove to boil water myself. It can't be that I let mother boil water, right? The old lady had nothing to say to this, and paused before laughing: Then. We'll have to call back Liu Ma tomorrow. This old lady, with deep plans, reversed the original plan with her love for her son. It turned out that this old lady, although not yet fifty years old, had been a widow for almost twenty years. She had raised this orphan by saving and economizing, and by doing some needlework for the flower shop to supplement her income. People also thought that because his mother was determined to raise the orphan, this child should walk on the right path. Taking these two words [Guo Qi], was nothing more than a kind of encouragement. The situation in society is always contradictory. The more wealthy families there are, the more sons and brothers there are who have money to go to school and money to buy books, but they never succeed in their studies. On the other hand, the children of poor families have no external things to tempt them, and parents have great hopes and strict supervision, so naturally they have hope of studying. Zhang Guoqi had been studying at a nearby church school since he was a child. Because Old Lady Zhang taught diligently every day, he studied very hard. And his nature was very docile and never mischievous. Therefore, the school authorities valued him very much, and knowing that his family was really poor, they simply waived his tuition. As Guoqi grew older year by year, he knew that receiving free treatment at school was not an easy thing, so he studied even harder. After graduating from middle school, he worked as a teacher in the affiliated elementary school, and at the same time, he still studied Chinese and Western languages at home. In his spare time, he also wrote novels and notes and submitted them to newspapers or magazines in Shanghai. At first, it was just an occasional pleasure to write two articles for relaxation. Later, when the monthly manuscript fees were settled, he actually had an income of ten or twenty yuan, which could supplement his household a bit. This aroused Guoqi's interest. He thought that there was no need to expect to increase it much. If he had such a definite income every month, in addition to household expenses, he could really buy some books to read. So, every day after he came home from teaching painting at school, the first thing he did was to return to that long study room and write at his desk. After talking to his mother about that matter, he could not help but have a lot more worries. (14)</p>
<p>Sketches of Small People</p>
<h3>The Japanese Prime Minister Hirota, From Stonecutter</h3>
<p>— Ji Yun</p>
<p>Since the incident, the old and frail Japanese cabinet has been completely dissolved. Hirota Koki has been appointed Prime Minister to reorganize a new cabinet. Although the future is still dark and full of challenges, Hirota's reputation is already well known both domestically and abroad.</p>
<p>Mussolini was the child of a blacksmith's shop, Hitler was from a poor family, Stalin's father was a shoemaker, and Macdonald's family were fishermen. Heroes are not afraid of humble origins, and so Japan has a Prime Minister Hirota who comes from a stonecutter's background. Japan's class consciousness is very strict, and ministers are usually over sixty years old. Now, a commoner becomes Prime Minister, and his age is only fifty-nine, which is indeed a so-called "youth cabinet."</p>
<p>Hirota Koki was named Jotaro Yoshi in his childhood and lived in Gin'ya-cho, Fukuoka City. His father, Hirota Tokuhei, and his brother, Tokuemon, still run a stone shop there, carving tombstones and making stone lanterns for people. Japanese families are different from those in our country, and the relationship between father and son is not very deep. Just because the son becomes Prime Minister, the father does not necessarily become an idle old man. In the past, Tokuhei entered the Hirota stone shop as a worker due to poverty, so he changed his surname to Hirota. His original surname was Hayashi, and his relatives had already fallen into decline.</p>
<p>Hirota studied at Fukuoka Shojo Elementary School in his childhood, and his family was so poor that they often had to delay paying tuition fees. After returning home, he helped his father move stone, or wore workers' clothes to collect debts. During the Dragon Boat Festival, he sold bamboo leaves and rushes to farmers and hawked them on the street.</p>
<p>At that time, there was an organization called Genyosha in Fukuoka, Japan, which was a disguised political party, led by Mitsuru Toyama. When Hirota graduated from elementary school, the Japanese Foreign Minister Okuma was assassinated in a carriage due to diplomatic failure, and his right foot was blown off. The suicide bomber was Heki Koshiki, a member of Genyosha. Hirota's ability to rise to prominence was due to his joining the Genyosha.</p>
<p>After graduating from higher elementary school, Hirota entered Shuyukan Middle School to study. He joined Genyosha, learned judo, and studied Yangming philosophy. He also entered Shaolin Temple to study Zen and became a Buddhist. Even now, he often carries a string of prayer beads in his suit pocket. During his middle school days, Japan defeated the Qing Dynasty, and he saw the triumphant officers with high spirits. So he wanted to become a soldier and applied to the military academy. Soon after, due to diplomatic failure, the Liaodong Peninsula was returned to our country. He was indignant and went to Tokyo with his classmate Hirata Tomoe to prepare to study diplomacy.</p>
<p>Most Japanese politicians must graduate from Tokyo Imperial University, so the two had to carry bamboo umbrellas and schoolbags, walking from Osaka, Kyoto, and Nara to Tokyo, living in a small ravine in Koishikawa. Soon, fellow villagers and seniors formed a group called "Koko-ya." Japanese newspapers called them Liangshan Marsh. Hirose Tanso wrote a poem describing their life: "Do not say that a foreign land is full of hardships, compatriots and friends are naturally close to each other, the firewood crackles out frost like snow, you draw water from the river, I gather firewood."</p>
<p>To enter the Imperial University, one must first enter the First Higher School, so he was admitted as the top student. Through the introduction of Toyama Mitsuru, he met Yamazaki Enjiro of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. His ability to enter the diplomatic world was all due to Yamazaki's promotion. Later, when he was in his second year at the Imperial University, the Russo-Japanese situation became urgent, and international intelligence was needed. So Hirota was sent to Korea to detect Russian military intelligence. He landed in Yingkou and took a train to Lushun, where he was inspected by Russian soldiers. He did not understand a single word of Russian, so a Chinese person on the train translated for him, and he took out his Imperial University certificate, explaining that he was traveling in the three northeastern provinces, and only then did he pass the difficult situation. Because at that time, the two countries had not yet gone to war, otherwise he would have become a prisoner long ago.</p>
<p>At that time, a student at the Imperial University was a future important person. Moreover, Hirota had close ties with the diplomatic world and had even more hope, so Iwasaki, the head of the wealthy Mitsubishi family, wanted to marry his daughter to him, but he did not succeed. Later, Takahashi Korekiyo, the president of the Bank of Japan (i.e., the recently assassinated Minister of Finance), took a photo of his daughter and personally proposed marriage to Hirota, but he was flatly rejected.</p>
<p>After graduating from the Imperial University, Hirota failed the diplomatic officer exam due to his poor English grades. He took the exam again the following year and got first place, and went to Beiping, our country, as an attaché to the minister. After living there for two years, he became a China expert. After returning to his home country, through the introduction of Toyama Mitsuru, he married Shizuko, the daughter of Mitsuru Toyama of the Genyosha. The wives of diplomats must follow their husbands to work in Europe and America, so most of them have adopted a European and American lifestyle. However, this Mrs. Shizuko is a thoroughly Japanese woman who has not learned any foreign manners in Europe. She is now fifty-two years old and rarely even watches movies.</p>
<p>When Hirota was a third-class secretary in the British Embassy, he disagreed with Foreign Minister Shidehara, so he was transferred to the Dutch Embassy, and then to the Russian Embassy. Who knew that he would use this as a springboard to gradually rise to prominence.</p>
<p>Although he is now the Prime Minister, his private residence in Harajuku is still very simple. In addition to Mrs. Shizuko, there are two sons, one daughter, three maids, and two cats in the house. He adopts a laissez-faire attitude towards his children. When razors, toothpaste, and pens cannot be found, he asks, "Who used my things again?" Radio calisthenics after getting up every day is his only way to stay healthy. But his gestures and movements, like dancing, are often ridiculed by his daughter. He takes two baths every day, morning and evening, and hums poetry in a low voice while soaking in the tub, which is his habit.</p>
<p>Hirota's mother had never been to Tokyo. Once, Hirota was transferred back to Tokyo. He went to the countryside to accompany his mother to visit Tokyo. Who knew that she had never ridden a train before and became as dizzy as if she were drunk. Halfway there, she refused to ride the train any further. So they had to get off the train in the middle of the journey and spend the night. Hirota and his mother then took rickshaws back to Fukuoka.</p>
<p>He likes painting the most. Although he cannot paint himself, he has a large collection at home. Most of his monthly salary is spent on buying paintings. In addition, he likes growing flowers. When he was the Dutch Minister, he grew a lot of tulips. In the country, he grows potted plants. Although he is Japanese, he likes to read the philosophy of Wang Yangming of our country, and he always has Yangming's works in his hand. He is indeed Yangming's confidant.</p>

<h3>The Body's Self-Healing Mechanism</h3>
<p>— Yao Xing Shu</p>
<p>We cannot but acknowledge the considerable significance and value of medicine in the treatment of diseases: indeed, quinine for malaria, 914 for syphilis, and serum therapy for diphtheria have remarkable efficacy, beyond any doubt. But of the thousands of drugs, apart from these, one can almost say that there are no others with such specific effects. The role of drugs used for other diseases in the cure of disease is merely to play a role of "assisting from the sidelines": apart from a portion of diseases that require surgical treatment, adopting a method of "decisive cut," many diseases can be cured by relying on the body's own strength, which is the so-called body's self-healing mechanism.</p>
<p>Although the term self-healing mechanism is not seen in our country's inherent medical books, people in the past long ago recognized the efficacy of drugs: "The best doctor does not use medicine," "Healed by medicine, also healed without medicine," "Three parts medicine, seven parts conditioning." These traditional sayings prove that our predecessors already knew that the cure of disease is not entirely the result of medicine.</p>
<p>Disease, especially various acute and chronic infectious diseases, can be said to be a reaction of a living body to external harmful causes. When disease occurs, the body's inherent self-healing mechanism begins to activate in order to resist it. This can be proven experimentally and is not just empty talk.</p>
<p>In fact, we can also see that many diseases, especially when patients do not rely on any medical intervention due to economic reasons, can still be cured after a considerable period of time, which is the effect of the self-healing mechanism. The common understanding of most people is that they believe in the omnipotence of medicine and do not understand that the human body itself has this kind of self-defense force. This is very ignorant. Therefore, the trend of taking medicine is very popular in society, and some people even boast to their peers about the expensive value of the imported drugs they take, thinking of taking medicine as a kind of vanity. As a result, market speculators are created, newspaper drug advertisements are abnormally developed, and some doctors' prescriptions are complicated, preferring to use prepared medicines, which is rarely seen in medically advanced countries.</p>
<p>However, according to what has been said above, it seems that there is no profound principle in the medical treatment of diseases. Apart from a few special diseases, if a person is sick, we can simply ignore it and let nature take its course. But that is not how it should be said.</p>
<p>Originally, for many diseases, the disease progresses, but the self-healing mechanism is slow to activate, and the body's valuable organs—the heart—first experience problems, which cannot help the cure of the disease; or the self-healing mechanism of the elderly and children is not very strong. These all rely on us to help, maintain, and promote.</p>
<p>In order to achieve this goal, in addition to taking appropriate medicines when sick, there are certain rules regarding diet, daily life, movement, and rest. This is to maintain physical strength and exert the self-healing mechanism. However, the general public is indifferent to this, thinking it is a minor matter, and that taking medicine is the most important thing, and they are unwilling to put it into practice. This is simply destroying the self-healing mechanism, so that the disease does not heal, or is difficult to heal, and finally the blame is placed on the medicine and improper treatment.</p>
<p>I do not want to give many examples to avoid being too verbose. Let me briefly explain a couple of diseases.</p>
<p>Let's talk about typhoid fever. Typhoid fever is a kind of acute infectious disease, and there are several types. The severity and urgency of the disease, and whether it is regular or not, are different for each person, even if they suffer from the same typhoid fever. There is still no specific treatment for this disease. Medical knowledge and ability can only maintain physical strength and allow the body's self-healing mechanism to develop in order to cure the disease. This is called wait-and-see treatment: thus, diet, daily life, movement, and rest are strictly limited based on experience. If early diagnosis and early warning can be given, unless the body is originally too frail, or the virulence of the pathogenic bacteria is too severe, most people can be cured. Because patients lack the knowledge of recuperation during illness, or their diet is improper, their nutrition is unbalanced, or they do not keep quiet and their mental strength declines prematurely, before the self-healing mechanism is fully developed, they end up dying.</p>
<p>Let's talk about tuberculosis. Everyone knows that it is a troublesome and dangerous disease. Modern medicine has no direct way to treat it. Whether it is cured or not depends on the body's self-healing mechanism. If a tuberculosis patient is diagnosed early by a doctor—it must be discovered early, or it will be too late—and implements nutritional therapy, quiet rest therapy, pays attention to sunlight and air, and adds some appropriate medicines, they will be able to fully recover their health in three to five years. However, ordinary people cannot understand this principle and cannot implement it accordingly. Although they inject medicine, take medicine, and even undergo surgery, causing a great commotion, in the end, they still become ghosts of tuberculosis.</p>
<h3>A Global Perspective on Tuberculosis Statistics (6)</h3>
<p>— Ding Hui Kang</p>
<p>Regarding the course of tuberculosis and the influence of race, Olive View Sanatorium has collected reports of 4,378 cases, all of whom were given the same treatment and therapy. It was found that the majority of black patients had a very high death rate, while the death rates of American Slavic and Jewish people were relatively safe. Regarding how this material proves the relationship between tuberculosis susceptibility and race, the question remains.</p>
<p>Bowen's research also has considerable value, namely, the occurrence of tuberculosis in various different races, and its various different courses and infectivity. In Wales, there is considerable evidence that the course of tuberculosis in the mountain residents is mostly acute and progressive, while the northern race residents in the plains mostly suffer from chronic tuberculosis and die at a later age. In coal-burning industrial areas, the proportion of deaths is the opposite, regardless of the people. The reason may be that the mountain residents have greatly increased their resistance by moving to the plains. The northern race residents have lost most of their resistance due to the dust in the coal-burning areas. Therefore, changing from a plains lifestyle to an industrial lifestyle is enough to promote the aggravation of the disease.</p>
<p>Gutinann believes that under the same living conditions, the tuberculosis death rate of Jewish people is better than that of other ethnic groups, even in economic panic and poor sanitary conditions. This special safe status of Jewish people may be due to inherited protective ability and increased resistance to the early formation of the disease. This situation is special, and other ethnic groups lack the same discovery.</p>
<p>Judging from the above observations, the relationship between tuberculosis and race, despite the use of various statistical methods, has not been proven to solve this problem.</p>
<p>Regarding the statistics of tuberculosis deaths in large cities, most are higher than those in smaller cities. As for the reasons for the increase and decrease of tuberculosis deaths, the general observation is that the most valuable is that tuberculosis is a social disease and has less to do with public health. On the contrary, there is a considerable proportion with the general economic situation. In any case, poor living conditions, narrow and dense spaces, and people moving from the countryside to the city are all reasons for the increase in tuberculosis deaths.</p>
<p>The tuberculosis death statistics in New York, despite the differences in regions, the complexity of resident races, and the rapid prosperity, have now been reduced to only 7.3 tuberculosis deaths per 10,000 residents (1928). At the same time, the death rate statistics in 45 major American cities, in the total population of 30 million residents, averaged 8.13 deaths.</p>
<p>Chicago has only 6.6 deaths (per 10,000 residents), which is lower than New York. The death rate in western cities is only 3.5. However, the death rate in the center of the city is higher than in the countryside. In terms of ethnic statistics, there are 80 cases for Chinese people, 40 cases for black people, 30 cases for Irish people, 20 cases for Swedish and Norwegian people, 12.2 cases for Italian people, and 8.6 cases for Russian Jewish people (per 10,000 residents). The reasons for these ethnic differences, although difficult to solve due to various different situations, of course have a special relationship with the public situation.</p>
<p>What is the ratio of tuberculosis deaths between rural and urban areas? Chodzko's observation at the International Health Office of the League of Nations proves that the highest death rate from tuberculosis is in underdeveloped agricultural areas. In recent years, the death rate from tuberculosis in rural areas has gradually increased, and may even exceed that in urban areas. However, McMullen's research in the United States shows that the percentage of children with a positive tuberculin reaction is a ratio of 9 to 71%, and the low number belongs to rural areas. Flatzeck also believes that the spread of tuberculosis is generally less in rural areas.</p>
<p>In recent years, the degree of decrease in the death rate from tuberculosis in rural areas is not as great as that in urban areas. What is the reason for this? This may be because the death rate from tuberculosis in rural areas has reached a certain minimum peak. For example, in the provinces of Trante and Ketlun in the Netherlands, the death rate from tuberculosis in rural areas is higher than that in urban areas. The reason may be due to errors in statistics and reports, household transmission in rural areas, and the large family system, which are also very dangerous reasons. According to the statistics of Ratibor, there are 4.66 in rural areas and 297 in cities who are infected by families with open tuberculosis.</p>
<p>According to reports from France, there are not many cases of tuberculosis infection in young children in rural areas. Positive tuberculin reactions are mostly discovered around the age of nineteen, and positive reactions are found in 60% of adults. What is most noteworthy is the proof by Sergent and Gonin that people who move from rural areas to cities are prone to acute lesions within the first two years, especially young people of both sexes. If these patients return to the countryside after a short period of treatment or recuperation, due to the lack of various sanitary facilities, they will create a great danger of infectious pathogens. To avoid this unfortunate phenomenon, the only way is to prohibit residents from moving from rural areas to cities. And men seem to sacrifice more to tuberculosis than women. Famine and alcohol seem to have no significant relationship with tuberculosis.</p>
<p>According to Italian reports, tuberculosis transmission is also greatly related to residents returning from cities to rural areas. The climate in central and southern Italy is very good, so tuberculosis is also very peaceful in the countryside. The number of tuberculosis infections is directly proportional to the population density, especially in industrial areas.</p>
<p>There are few statistical reports on the Russian countryside, and they are not very complete. After the European War, tuberculosis infection in rural areas increased sharply. As for the comparison between rural and urban areas, it is impossible to know for sure. In short, the living environment of the villagers, the circumstances of life, the severity of work, alcohol, poor nutrition, and syphilis are all greatly related to tuberculosis.</p>
<p>The most important thing is the relationship between tuberculosis deaths and various different ages. There were two statistical reports from all over Germany and the province of Prussia until 1932. These statistics are extremely valuable because the tuberculosis death rates of both sexes have been statistically separated in the most recent five years.</p>

<h3>Common Knowledge of Hygiene for Ear, Nose, Throat, and Eye Diseases</h3>
<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(86) Ptosis</p>
<p>Ptosis is a condition in which the upper eyelid droops. It is caused by insufficient function of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle. The palpebral fissure often appears closed. There are two types: congenital and acquired. It can be classified into seven causes.</p>
<p>Congenital ptosis - caused by congenital maldevelopment of the muscle or nerve. It is usually combined with eye muscle paralysis, nystagmus, etc.</p>
<p>Paralytic ptosis - The cause of this type of ptosis is mostly syphilitic. It is caused by paralysis of the oculomotor nerve. It is usually combined with paralysis of the external and internal eye muscles.</p>
<p>Sympathetic nerve paralysis ptosis - In sympathetic nerve paralysis, the superior tarsal muscle is also paralyzed, resulting in a slight drooping of the eyelid. Its causes are mostly neck surgery, trauma, or thyroid enlargement, etc.</p>
<p>Trachomatous ptosis - In severe trachoma, the conjunctiva and cartilage of the eyelid are swollen and thickened. At this time, the eyelid often droops slightly due to its weight.</p>
<p>Myasthenic ptosis - After getting up in the morning, ptosis often gradually occurs in one or both eyes. It is said that it is caused by abnormal endocrine function.</p>
<p>Lipomatous ptosis - When there is a lot of subcutaneous fat in the eyelid, it can often cause mild ptosis.</p>
<p>Symptomatic ptosis - This disease is also known as pseudo-ptosis. It is caused by tumors, edema, swelling, etc. in the eyelid, resulting in thickened upper eyelid, which droops due to its own gravity. Furthermore, spastic ptosis caused by spasm of the orbicularis oculi muscle is also a type of symptomatic ptosis. Treatment of ptosis.</p>
<p>Emphasis should be placed on treating the underlying cause first. If the illness is prolonged or congenital, surgical treatment should be used.</p>
<h3>Domestic Medicinal Plants (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Mengbai</p>
<p>(4) Gualou (Trichosanthes japonica, Regel)</p>
<p>(Plant) It grows wild in the fields and is a perennial vine. It is dioecious. The stems and leaves are hairless, and the leaves are light green with a smooth surface. The tendrils are branched, and the berries are yellow when ripe, and are broadly elliptical.</p>
<p>(Crude Drug) Gualou Root (Radix Trichosanthis) - It is made by collecting the roots of Gualou, peeling off the cortex, and drying them. This product is a large, irregular mass, usually cut open with straight lines. The outer surface is similar to white, and the cross-section is white and powdery.</p>
<p>Gualou Kernel (Semen Trichosanthis) - It is made by collecting its seeds. The surface of this product is light yellow, flat and elliptical, slightly pointed at one end, and about one centimeter long.</p>
<p>(Ingredients) The roots contain a large amount of starch. The seeds contain about 26% fatty oil.</p>
<p>(Medicinal Use) Old prescriptions: Gualou Fruit is an important medicine for treating coughs and thirst in febrile diseases. It has special effects on stopping hemoptysis and relieving fever in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. It is also effective for diuresis and promoting lactation. The efficacy of Gualou Kernel is roughly the same. The daily dose is 8 grams, used as a decoction.</p>
<p>Old sayings: It moistens lung dryness, prevents fire, treats coughs, cleanses phlegm, benefits the throat, and stops thirst.</p>
<p>Prescription example: Gualou Kernel Decoction, used to treat intestinal carbuncles, postpartum menstruation, etc.</p>
<p>Coix Seed 15.0 Peach Kernel, Moutan Bark, Gualou Kernel 4.0 each</p>
<p>The above is made into a decoction of 200, and taken in three divided doses a day.</p>
<p>Gualou Qu Mai Pills, used to treat thirst and other symptoms, and used as a diuretic.</p>
<p>Gualou Root 30.0 Qu Mai 15.0 Poria, Yam 12.0 each Aconite 1</p>
<p>The above is ground into a powder, mixed with honey and refined into balls the size of parasol seeds. Take three divided doses a day.</p>
<p>The effect of Gualou Root is roughly the same. The starch made from Gualou Root, called Tian Hua Fen, can treat eczema and other skin diseases, and is used externally.</p>
<h3>Q&amp;A on Dental Knowledge (30)</h3>
<p>— Lin Jianxian</p>
<p>(Question 145) How should food be cooked?</p>
<p>Answer: The fresher and more natural the food, the better. Uncooked food has ample nutrients and is richest in vitamins, which is most beneficial for teeth. The residents of the Cook Islands, due to their environment, live a hard life, but because all the children on the island are accustomed to drinking raw milk, almost none of them have cavities. The strength of the physique and the firmness of the teeth of ancient people were probably largely due to the practice of eating raw meat and drinking blood. We probably cannot eat food entirely raw, and there is a risk of germs and parasites. Cooking is necessary to eliminate germs and make food palatable, but it should only be cooked until it is cooked through and palatable, and should not be cooked for too long or processed and seasoned excessively. Anything heated for too long, or too salty or too stimulating, such as preserved meats, loses its vitamins, is difficult to digest, and has very little nutritional value, and is not good for teeth.</p>
<p>(Question 146) Why is brown rice more beneficial to teeth than white rice?</p>
<p>Answer: The bran layer on the outside of brown rice contains more vitamins, proteins, and minerals than the rice itself, which is extremely nourishing for both the teeth and the entire body. Moreover, brown rice can also exercise the teeth. White rice cooked from refined rice, although clean and attractive, mainly contains starch and is far less nourishing than brown rice. The same is true for wheat; flour with bran is more beneficial than white flour. Rice and wheat are the main foods in our country, but they are often over-refined, reducing their natural nutrients. It is highly advisable to promote improvement, so that eating one bowl of rice can yield the benefits of one and a half bowls. Some say that brown rice is coarse, hard, and difficult to eat, but that is because it is not cooked properly. If more water is added and it is cooked longer, the aroma is even better than white rice, and one will naturally get used to eating it regularly.</p>
<p>(Question 147) Why should we regularly eat coarse or fiber-rich foods?</p>
<p>Answer: If we only eat soft foods, our teeth will degenerate due to lack of use, and our bodies will become weak and prone to illness. We must often eat coarse or fiber-rich foods to exercise our teeth and naturally clean food debris attached to our teeth. Therefore, these foods are called cleansing foods. If we eat some vegetables such as celery, greens, pickled vegetables, and bamboo shoots, or fruits such as apples, at the end of each meal, it will be very beneficial.</p>
<p>(Question 148) Why are foods that are too hard not good for teeth?</p>
<p>Answer: Coarse foods are certainly good, but when chewing foods that are too hard, it is often easy to exert excessive force, which can damage the tooth enamel. When eating hard-shelled fruits, hard candies, or dry-fried hard broad beans, etc., one should be cautious if one's teeth are not yet very strong.</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (88)</h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Given the reasons why tuberculosis bacteria cannot be eradicated as described above, I must solemnly advise readers not to be pessimistic because of this, adopting an attitude of "scarcely have I taken a step when thorns already grow." Excessive fear of tuberculosis bacteria creates countless people with neurasthenia, which in turn becomes a predisposing factor for tuberculosis. This is extremely undesirable! It is true that there is no tuberculosis without tuberculosis bacteria, but it is not the case that the entry of tuberculosis bacteria into the human body necessarily constitutes the disease; it requires another opportunity to form. Therefore, although all people in the world inevitably face the invasion of tuberculosis bacteria, only a portion ultimately develop the full disease, certainly not all or most. Moreover, not all tuberculosis patients are incurable, so why harbor such deep "杞人之憂" [unfounded worries]? Secondly, do not neglect our passive prevention measures simply because the eradication of tuberculosis bacteria is not a reality, thinking that avoiding contact with tuberculosis bacteria is impossible anyway, and that implementing preventive measures is like taking fifty steps compared to a hundred: it is better to simply let go, because as long as resistance is sufficient, the disease will not necessarily develop. The fallacy of this argument and its great harm are even more unimaginable. It is true that passive prevention is undoubtedly an incomplete effort. However, as far as we know, the fact that the sputum, clothing, utensils, etc. of patients with the disease are easily transmitted to others is clearly revealed. Based on known facts, our only goal is to do our best to prevent it using all possible methods within our current capabilities! Although its achievements may not satisfy our highest desires, its difference from complete abandonment is absolutely incomparable. Admittedly, some people have close contact with patients with the disease and do not get infected as a result. We certainly acknowledge such facts, but they are, in any case, extremely rare. We cannot negate the majority of facts because of a small number of lucky exceptions, just as we cannot say that the theory of syphilis heredity is unfounded simply because a father has syphilis and his son does not have congenital syphilis. Therefore, although it is a fact that tuberculosis bacteria cannot be eradicated and that completely avoiding contact with tuberculosis bacteria is impossible, we must still adopt all possible passive prevention measures.</p>
<p>The various preventive methods and how to implement them are things that ordinary patients and non-patients must understand. I will now describe them one by one below:</p>
<p>Section 1: Passive Prevention</p>
<p>The only purpose of passive prevention is to eradicate tuberculosis bacteria in society. These tuberculosis bacteria mostly live in tuberculosis lesions in the human body, and the medium for spreading tuberculosis bacteria to the outside world is the sputum of lung tuberculosis patients. Therefore, how to handle the sputum of patients with this disease is the most important task in prevention. However, we must also know that this dangerous sputum is not only the exclusive product of those suffering from progressive disease. Many patients with early or mild disease appear almost the same as healthy people, but tuberculosis bacteria are frequently found in their sputum, which of course makes it easy for everyone to ignore! Therefore, from a medical standpoint, anyone with even a slight suspicion of the disease must be thoroughly examined. The same level of attention should be paid to isolation as is paid to patients who have been definitively diagnosed. Furthermore, anyone who develops symptoms of coughing and excessive phlegm can be considered a suspect for tuberculosis transmission. In order to prevent problems before they occur, the same examination or treatment should be applied to their sputum as to that of patients with the disease, so that the problem can be solved once and for all!</p>

<h3>Acne</h3>
<p>— (Zhu Qiuyuan)</p>
<p>Acne, commonly known as pimples, often affects young men and women between the ages of fifteen or sixteen and twenty-five or twenty-six. They appear on the cheeks, forehead, bridge of the nose, etc., and resemble black dots like hat pins. They are completely aligned with the sebaceous gland openings. When squeezed from the side with force, thin, elongated, grayish-white lines of fatty material are discharged from within. These are mixtures of sebum, skin debris, and dirt. At the base of the acne, there may be small nodules that develop into pustules. Alternatively, three or four small pimples may be interconnected to form large pimples. The occurrence of acne is due to the obstruction caused by the secretion of sebum. Treatment method: First, squeeze out the impurities in the pimples as much as possible. Wash with soap. Then apply "Mian Li" fragrant cream. Mian Li can ensure that sebum flows freely without obstruction. On the one hand, it can shrink pores, making the skin instantly delicate, white, and tender. On the other hand, it can also protect the skin, preventing dirt and impurities from entering through the pores. Therefore, those who already have acne can hope for a quick recovery. Even those who have not been afflicted can prevent it by applying it.</p>
<h3>Treatment of Stomach Ailments</h3>
<p>— (Zhong Tao)</p>
<p>The stomach is a digestive organ and is essential for our nutrition. Food enters the stomach, and the mucous membrane secretes gastric juice. The stomach wall moves constantly, allowing the food bolus to be fully digested and turned into chyme. It then reaches the intestines, where the intestinal wall absorbs its essence and enters the blood. It travels with the bloodstream to all the tissues and cells of the body, allowing precious life to be maintained. If the stomach becomes ill, appetite is poor, and both gastric juice and peristalsis are weakened. The food bolus cannot be completely digested, and thus tissue cells cannot obtain their nourishment, leading to a daily decline in the body and the emergence of various illnesses. From this perspective, how significant is the stomach to human life? It is often seen that our compatriots are sallow-faced, emaciated, and withered in appearance. Upon examination, most suffer from stomach ailments. There are many causes and complex symptoms of stomach ailments. Initial manifestations often include nausea, belching, loss of appetite, acid reflux, heartburn, headache, and dizziness. Subsequently, the stomach becomes distended, and pain occurs, feeling like burning, kneading, stabbing, or prickling. This makes it impossible to work diligently. Complexion becomes haggard, and the spirit becomes exhausted. The best treatment method is to purchase and take "Wei Bi Ling." This medicine can promote the secretion of gastric juice, enhance the peristalsis of the stomach wall, aid digestion, promote blood circulation, stimulate the appetite, relieve pain, break up accumulations, and regulate qi. Its remarkable efficacy is difficult to describe in detail. (Editor's note: "Wei Bi Ling" is sold by Tong Ren Western Pharmacy, located at No. 1 De Xing Li, Avenue Edward VII, West Xin Qiao Street, Shanghai. The price is one yuan per box. Mild cases can be cured with just one box. Even long-standing liver and stomach qi pain only requires two or three boxes.)</p>
<h3>Mian Li is Indeed Worth Recommending</h3>
<p>— (Manuscript from Han Dingyuan)</p>
<p>"Mian Li is indeed worth recommending." This thought occurred to me after I experimented with Mian Li. This is not just joining in on the hype. The facts are as follows: A distant aunt of mine had a face full of freckles, especially on and around her nose. They were dense and numerous. Although she had no desire to learn anything modern, after hearing and seeing other people talk about the benefits of Mian Li in removing blemishes and pimples, she couldn't resist trying it. She immediately asked me to buy her a bottle and used it according to the instructions. Although one bottle was not enough to cure her, it did thin them out a lot. Later, she continued to use two or three bottles. Sure enough, after three bottles, she turned the freckles on her face into nothing, completely removing them. She was, of course, overjoyed. Even I was surprised. The effectiveness of Mian Li is truly incredible. From now on, those suffering from freckles and pimples will have Mian Li, and I don't know how many people's facial imperfections will be cured.</p>
<h3>Case Study of Acute Gonorrhea Treatment</h3>
<p>— (Jing Jie)</p>
<p>In the early stages of gonorrhea, the lesions are mostly limited to the local urethra. Therefore, it is also known as gonococcal urethritis. There are many causes and types of ordinary urethritis. Generally speaking, they can be divided into four types: chemical causes, hot and cold causes, mechanical causes, and bacterial causes. Among them, bacterial causes account for more than 60% of the causes of inflammation, and the most common bacterium causing urethritis is *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*. This bacterium invades the urethral mucosa, causing suppuration, swelling, and pain. This is what is called gonococcal urethritis, which is actually the onset of gonorrhea symptoms. Zhang Jinfang, a factory mechanic, had casual relations with a prostitute. The next day, he suddenly felt pain when urinating, and pus flowed from the urethral opening. He sought treatment from me. I had him urinate into a glass cup. The urine was turbid and had floating small bodies of flocculent and filamentous material. Under microscopic examination, gonococcal diplococci were seen scattered inside and outside the pus cells. I diagnosed it as acute gonorrhea. Because of his job responsibilities, he was unable to come to the clinic daily. He asked me what medicine he should take. I told him to take three boxes of "Gonadothen" as directed. Ten days later, he came back to me, looking comfortable and having returned to his normal state. I re-examined his urine and no gonococci were found. I did not expect the efficacy of "Gonadothen" to be so rapid and remarkable. It is truly worthy of being a method for self-treatment. (Editor's note: "Gonadothen" is a modern standard internal medicine for treating gonorrhea. Many Chinese and Western doctors have done clinical trials. The price is two yuan per box. The general management office is Tong Ren Western Pharmacy, located at No. 1 De Xing Li, Avenue Edward VII, West Xin Qiao Street, Shanghai.)</p>
<h3>A Record of "Gan Lu" Curing Scabies</h3>
<p>— (Yong Ran)</p>
<p>The "Gan Lu" medicinal liquid (sold for one yuan per bottle), produced by Tong Ren Western Pharmacy at No. 1 De Xing Li, West Xin Qiao Street, French Concession, Shanghai, is a highly effective preparation for skin diseases. Its efficacy in treating diseases such as ringworm and sores is divine and rapid, and it has long been praised by Chinese and foreign doctors. I have repeatedly used it with great satisfaction in my clinical practice. Here, I will describe an example of curing 頭癩痢 [scabies] with "Gan Lu."</p>
<p>Young Master Xu Xiaoqing is the nephew of my friend Mr. Xue Hongxun. He is fourteen years old and studies at a certain junior high school. He has suffered from 頭癩痢 for a long time and has been repeatedly treated without success. His classmates despise him and gave him the nickname "Lime Xiaoqing." Recently, he sought treatment from me. I observed that his physique was average. Other than the 頭癩痢, he had no other diseases. The skin on his entire head was almost bald. Only a few sparse hairs remained, and it emitted a foul odor. Looking at it, it was like aquatic plants on a sandy beach, or trees on a cold mountain. I told him to apply "Gan Lu" medicinal liquid himself every day. Two months later, his mother bought a pig's trotter and two baskets of apples and came to my door to thank me, saying that Xiaoqing's 頭癩痢 was completely cured and that his hair was gradually growing back. His classmates said to each other, "Lime Xiaoqing is now lush green." Alas, 頭癩痢 is a skin disease. Why is it so ridiculed? I hope that those in the world who suffer from this disease will quickly purchase "Gan Lu" and apply it.</p>
<h3>The Harm of Leukorrhea</h3>
<p>— (Qian An)</p>
<p>All diseases of the female reproductive organs can cause the symptom of leukorrhea, excreting a large amount of serous secretions. The main symptom is mostly chronic endometritis. In women who are relatively obese, the skin of the vulva and the inner thighs becomes swollen, hot, and even eroded due to the irritation of the secretions. Pain and itching occur together, which is very distressing. The most common cause of leukorrhea is infection, and the main cause is gonorrhea. When gonococci invade the uterine mucosa and cause endometritis, they often cause miscarriage if pregnancy occurs. Patients often do not understand the cause of their own illness. They are ashamed of their illness and unwilling to seek medical treatment, leading to the upward spread of gonococci, which causes cervicitis, endometritis, salpingitis, oophoritis, pelvic peritonitis, etc., and ultimately prevents pregnancy. Isn't this a big mistake? Now there is a very simple method that can cause leukorrhea infected with gonococci, as well as ordinary leukorrhea, to be completely cured in the shortest period of time. The method is to use both "Internal Leukorrhea Pills" and "External Leukorrhea Medicine" at the same time. By applying both internally and externally, complete success can be achieved. These two medicines are sold by Tong Ren Western Pharmacy at No. 1 De Xing Li, West Xin Qiao Street, Avenue Edward VII, Shanghai. The price for each type is two yuan per box.</p>
<h3>Healed Many People's Acne and Freckles</h3>
<p>— (Manuscript from Jiang Xueqing)</p>
<p>There are many people in my family. Two suffer from freckles: my eldest sister-in-law and my younger sister. Three suffer from acne: my elder sister, my younger brother, and me. At first, I thought, "Why are there so many people in my family who suffer from these facial ailments?" However, after inquiring among relatives and neighbors, I found that five or six out of ten also suffer from them. It can be seen that few people in the world have flawless appearances, and that acne and freckles are the cause of their imperfections. Isn't this a defect in human life? I have often seen in the newspapers that "Mian Li" can treat freckles and acne. My family members all urged me to buy it. I alone did not think so. One day, my younger sister came home from school holding something in her hand, laughing and saying, "I bought Mian Li!" Everyone cheered and scrambled for it. I secretly laughed at their foolishness. Ten days later, my elder sister's acne was healed. The freckles of my elder sister-in-law and younger sister became sparse and faded. My younger brother and I were surprised and asked them about it. They all said that it was the result of applying "Mian Li." They laughed and said to me, "You still don't believe it?" From that day on, my younger brother and I each bought a bottle. A week later, the acne suffered by both of us was healed one after the other. By this time, the freckles of my sister-in-law and younger sister were also completely cured. The total cost was only eight or nine yuan, but it transformed the faces of five people, turning ugliness into beauty. This is truly worth it. Therefore, I wrote this to record it.</p>
<h3>What Those Who Suffer From Nocturnal Emission Must Know</h3>
<p>— (Chi Long)</p>
<p>If unmarried young men have infrequent nocturnal emissions, this is sperm overflow and should not be considered a disease. However, if the frequency is high, or if there are wet dreams, or nocturnal emissions without dreams, or if it continues after masturbation, or if it is combined with insomnia, palpitations, and memory loss, then this is a disease. If it is not treated early, it will have a great impact on one's health. Symptoms of neurasthenia such as impotence and premature ejaculation will follow. One will gradually fall into mental exhaustion and be unable to endure the labor of work and walking. Premature aging will occur, and one's life and career will be ruined. There are many ways to treat it. The simplest and most effective way is to take "Xi Ru Kang," issued by Shanghai Tong Ren Western Pharmacy. The effects of this medicine in strengthening sperm and benefiting the brain have long been proven by doctors and repeatedly tested. Therefore, I especially record this to inform those who suffer from nocturnal emission what to choose. I heard that this medicine sells for two yuan per bottle.</p>

<p>Liver and Stomach Qi Pain</p>
<p>My wife has suffered from liver and stomach qi pain since giving birth last year due to improper food intake. It is now gradually worsening and is unresponsive to medicine. I have long admired your publication's accurate guidance. Therefore, I respectfully inquire and beg you to provide a good prescription. (Jiang Yao asks)</p>
<p>(Answer) Poor digestion after childbirth, occasionally due to improper food intake, can easily harm the stomach. The "Wei Bi Ling" medicine powder sold by Tong Ren Western Pharmacy, No. 1 De Xing Li, West Xin Qiao Street, Avenue Edward VII, Shanghai, can stop the pain within minutes for stomach ailments and stomach pain. It has been repeatedly tested and proven effective and does not recur. It can be purchased and used immediately.</p>
<p>Neurasthenia</p>
<p>I suffer from neurasthenia. The cause is that I read too many books and newspapers in the past two years and overworked my brain. Also, I often have nocturnal emissions at night. Now, although my appetite has not decreased, I have no memory and cannot endure hard work. Sometimes my limbs are weak. Being so young, I feel very disheartened. Therefore, I send this letter seeking a treatment method. (Qiu Xuejian asks)</p>
<p>(Answer) The causes of neurasthenia are generally not due to just one factor. For treatment, you should reduce mental exertion, control your desires, and keep your spirits relaxed. However, your body should not be too idle. For internal medicine, "Ke Ru Kang," issued by Shanghai Tong Ren Western Pharmacy, is quite effective in treating this condition. You can purchase and take it. The price is two yuan per bottle.</p>
<p>Ringworm Flares Up Periodically</p>
<p>I have suffered from ringworm for several years. It flares up slightly in warm weather and is unbearably itchy. The skin has scales and bloodstains, which is especially disgusting. Now that my wedding is approaching, I ask you to provide a treatment method. I am extremely grateful. (Ke Nianzhuang asks)</p>
<p>(Answer) "Gan Lu" medicinal liquid is most effective for treating skin diseases such as ringworm, sores, and scabies. Refer to the instruction manual for usage.</p>
<p>Gonadothen</p>
<p>I unfortunately contracted gonorrhea. After taking "Gonadothen," my urine turned red. I don't know if this is good or bad. I hope you can give me instructions to resolve my doubts. (Cui Desheng asks)</p>
<p>(Answer) "Gonadothen" is a pigment preparation. The urine turns red after taking it because its medicinal power has reached the bladder. There is no need to be alarmed.</p>
<p>Red and White Leukorrhea</p>
<p>My wife has given birth three times without any abnormalities. Unexpectedly, in October of last year, she felt slightly unwell due to tiring housework. Afterwards, she had severe abdominal pain, followed by red and white leukorrhea intermingling and flowing out. My wife was terrified by this sight. Half a year of medicine has had no effect. Therefore, I inquire your publication, begging you to give me the good news as a prayer. (You Yizhi asks)</p>
<p>(Answer) Leukorrhea is a common disease of women. Your wife's red and white leukorrhea is more serious. I heard that the internal Leukorrhea Pills sold by Tong Ren Western Pharmacy in this city have great efficacy. It is best to use them. I especially recommend them. I heard that the price is two yuan per box.</p>
<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>The End of the Traitor</h3>
<p>— Xin</p>
<p>According to recent reports, Ling Sheng, the puppet governor of 北省 [Hebei province], Chun De, the police chief, Fu Ling, the chief of staff of the First Garrison Army, and Hua Yitai, the secretary, were executed for colluding with Soviet Russia and Outer Mongolia. Readers of the newspaper feel sorry for these four people, believing that they were able to secretly ally with the Soviets and Mongols to resist the Japanese puppets, and that such traitors were still redeemable and not the worst of traitors. Now, they have been tragically executed because their rebellion was discovered, which is truly regrettable.</p>
<p>In fact, these kinds of traitors truly sought their own death, what is called "walking right into the trap." Generally, those who become traitors but are unwilling to be traitors, or who plot to return to the right path, or who seek to secretly ally with other forces, have three reasons:</p>
<p>The first type only seeks to be promoted and get rich. After being a traitor for a long time, they see that there are no more positions to be promoted to and no wealth to be acquired, failing to satisfy their desires. Therefore, they are frustrated and want to seek other developments and find another way out.</p>
<p>The second type wants to borrow the power of foreigners to fulfill their dream of restoration. However, when the puppet regime is formed, they realize that they have been sold out, and only then do they wake up from their grand dream. Therefore, they seek other methods to implement their original主張 [position, idea].</p>
<p>The third type has no way to resist tyranny and has to live in comfort and maintain their position, temporarily preserving their salary. Once there is an opportunity, they will try to recover the lost territory and wipe out the previous shame. But when the opportunity is difficult to obtain and they are unwilling, they come up with a new plan to break free.</p>
<p>The first two types of traitors mentioned above are not worth mentioning. However, if it is the third type, although their intentions are brighter, once they accept a puppet position, they become traitors. Once they become traitors, they are under the command and supervision of a certain force, providing them with services. Since things have already reached this point, it is very difficult to break free from the shackles. Once imprisoned, they are controlled. If secrets are leaked even slightly, disaster will follow. The matter is difficult to handle even in suspicion. Moreover, once they have served the puppet regime, where does their integrity lie? The end of the traitor should be like this.</p>
<p>Therefore, people have their own stance, and countries have their own stance. Aligning with Russia and being friendly with Mongolia are originally free and inherently acceptable. However, once one accepts a puppet position, one is under the command of the puppet government. Colluding with Russia and Mongolia becomes treason. Those who commit treason die, which is a matter of course. Therefore, the deaths of Ling Sheng, Chun De, Fu Ling, and Hua Yitai were originally unavoidable. It is still unknown to which of the three types the traitors Ling Sheng and the others belonged, but their way of seeking death was the same. Therefore, I briefly describe this for those who have no choice but to become traitors, because of the deaths of Ling Sheng and the others.</p>
<h3>Melancholy</h3>
<p>— Ding Chang</p>
<p>Every time I went to the factory dormitory to find Klin, I would always encounter that pot-bellied, elderly self-appointed watchman sitting on a bench outside the gate. His face was so dejected, as if he were in a state of slumber. His two melancholic eyes were deeply hidden in his sunken eye sockets, as if lamenting his past dreams of prosperity.</p>
<p>Occasionally, a few pedestrians would rustle past him, which would immediately stir his heart. Inexplicably, he would suddenly raise his head in alarm to take a few glances, and then, then he would once again seem to sink into a state of slumber.</p>
<p>He was an aging foreign wanderer! His hometown was on the distant banks of the Mangtcb River. He drew it for me on the ground with his finger.</p>
<p>He also bitterly complained to me about the difficulties of life in a foreign country. He said he had lived in Harbin for many years, but life forced him to leave, and three years ago he wandered to Shenyang.</p>
<p>Half his life had been spent in the dust of foreign lands, a wasted past, now only yielding a body of melancholy. His aging heart was sorrowful. His face was gaunt, and the light of laughter had vanished! His youth had slipped away like a fleeting dream: the glorious spring would also turn into the desolation of autumn!</p>
<p>The first time I went to find Klin, I stopped at the gate of their dormitory and said to the old watchman sitting on the bench in a state of slumber, with a smiling face:</p>
<p>— Old sir, excuse me, I need to see Comrade Klin.</p>
<p>— Klin? I'm afraid he's gone to work at the airport. He said this in extremely fluent Chinese that sounded very pleasant.</p>
<p>— He doesn't work during the day, he's on the night shift. — Night shift? Okay, then I'll go find him for you. He walked away eagerly.</p>
<p>In this way, because I went to find Klin time and time again, the old watchman became quite familiar with me. He loved to talk to me. His words were so amiable. Once, he asked me this:</p>
<p>— What is your relationship with Klin?</p>
<p>— We were classmates in middle school. I said with a smile, shaking my head.</p>
<p>— What agency do you work for?</p>
<p>— I don't have a job, I just came from the county town.</p>
<p>— Then what do you want to see Klin for?</p>
<p>— I want him to introduce me to work in the factory.</p>
<p>— What? You want to work too?</p>
<p>— Yes. If I don't work, I'll starve.</p>
<p>— Hehe…</p>
<p>— Old sir, when did you come to China?</p>
<p>— A long time ago, a long time ago.</p>
<p>— You're already old, aren't you?</p>
<p>— Old, old, ready to die! Soon to enter the grave.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>He sighed, his words so full of sorrow.</p>
<p>— What about your family?</p>
<p>— Where is there a family? I'm just a lonely person! I haven't had any children since I got married. My wife died in Harbin three years ago. Although I once had a home on the banks of the Mangtch River, I can't go back, I can't go back! Alas, sooner or later I will die in Shenyang!</p>
<p>Old tears flowed from his eye sockets, one by one.</p>
<p>From then on, whenever I went to find Klin, he would always have me sit on his bench and talk to me for a few minutes before he would bring Klin to me.</p>
<p>When I and Klin had finished our business and were about to leave, he would shake my hand:</p>
<p>— Goodbye, goodbye!</p>
<p>As he said this, a faint smile flickered across his gaunt face.</p>
<p>Not far away, I stopped and looked back. He was sitting on the bench again with a dejected face, still looking like he was in a state of slumber.</p>
<h3>Aina (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Especially</p>
<p>Around the time of dinner, two customers who seemed to have crawled out of a wine jar stumbled in, drunk. Somehow, they were so blind that they picked on Amao and Xiaomei at first glance. This gave Aina a major blow, realizing that there probably wouldn't be any hope for today.</p>
<p>After ten o'clock, the air here became tense. In each small room, laughter, laughter, the charming flirtatiousness, that set of seductive eyes, that set of massage magic, were truly enjoyable. In short, the air at this time was like a frying pan about to explode.</p>
<p>The indomitable Old Zhang occupied Aina's room again. For some reason, Aina would get angry and disgusted whenever she saw Old Zhang's little mustache. Indeed, he had made several attempts on her, but she had sent him away with just one word: "disappointment."</p>
<p>Naturally, business wouldn't allow her to refuse. After he jumped out of the bath, as usual, she applied her skills to his body, from his upper body to his lower body, her hands constantly pounding.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he grabbed her hand: "What's making you unhappy?" He paused: "Don't think about those things! Listen, people are laughing in the other rooms!" His few little mustaches almost formed a line.</p>
<p>She knew that in this erotic metropolis, as long as she was willing to sacrifice, she could receive unexpected rewards. At that time, everything was like a cloud that obscured her mind: family, sister, herself… a great revolving lantern of reincarnation!</p>
<p>It was closing time when Old Zhang finally left. Three banknotes were placed on the small round stool. Aina watched his back as he rushed out of the corridor, her hands trembling.</p>
<h3>Child</h3>
<p>— Lin Danqiu</p>
<p>Zhang Jun and his wife, whom I hadn't seen for a long time, suddenly stepped into my room last night. The husband had a wan smile on his face, and his eyes were red, as if he had just cried or was about to cry. The wife, on the other hand, had a completely mourning face.</p>
<p>"The child is dead, and we don't have money to buy a coffin. We want to borrow five dollars from you." Zhang's face darkened, and he looked as if his heart and liver had been dug out. The wan smile was gone.</p>
<p>"Um." The child with a yellow face, pointed mouth, and protruding eyes who would keep calling "Uncle, Uncle" as soon as he saw me flashed in my mind. I was stunned and couldn't answer.</p>
<p>"This child died pitifully. He was sick for two weeks and never saw a doctor once… At first, the illness was very mild." Mrs. Zhang blinked her eyes a few times, blinking out glistening tears.</p>
<p>Zhang's eyes were even redder.</p>
<p>"Don't be sad. People like us are not worthy of having children." I seemed to have forgotten that they had asked to borrow money. I just wanted to use the weapon of reason to overcome their sorrow.</p>
<p>"I swear I won't have any more children." Zhang said, gritting his teeth.</p>
<p>Mrs. Zhang glanced at her husband, a fierce smile flashing across her miserable face, a fierce smile that was even uglier than crying.</p>
<p>"Do you have the money, the money?" Zhang brought up the money again, and four wet eyes stared at my mouth together.</p>
<p>I was stunned.</p>
<p>I had spent the whole day borrowing and only managed to borrow three dollars to pay for food. Borrowing another five dollars was extremely difficult. But for a moment, I didn't want to tell them the truth. I should give my suffering friends a little hope, even if that hope might turn into even greater disappointment.</p>
<p>"I don't have any money myself. I'll try to find a way for you first thing tomorrow morning… But at the same time, you should try to find a way elsewhere too… Just in case…"</p>
<p>In the middle of the night, I had a terrible dream:</p>
<p>My wife, with her long hair disheveled, tears and snot mixed together, was rolling on the ground, crying and shouting: "I don't want to be human anymore, I don't want to be human anymore…" My mother sat on a bamboo chair, her face full of anger, her dry old eyes filled with tears, sending out trembling sounds from her trembling lips: "Look at her, everyone, this shrew, this shrew…"</p>
<p>"What's the matter, what's the matter?" I looked at my wife's tearful face and then at my mother's angry face.</p>
<p>"What's the matter!" My mother was startled when she saw me step into the doorway. "You don't come home year after year, and this shrew can't bear it, so she argues with me every day… She cries and shouts at the slightest provocation, acting like a rogue… Look at her, this shrew."</p>
<p>My wife suddenly struggled to get up, sat on the ground, and stopped crying loudly, but her low sobs became even more intense, causing her whole body to twitch.</p>
<p>"Why do you use such abusive… abusive words?… You keep saying 'sterile… thing…' If my husband doesn't come home, can I have children?"</p>
<p>My mother's angry lips trembled even more violently, as if she had nowhere to vent her anger. She suddenly stood up, rushed to my wife, stomped her small feet like crazy, and sent out vicious curses through gritted teeth:</p>
<p>"Did I say something wrong, you shrew?… Can you have children? Aren't you a rooster?… Ha, your husband is outside, but the wedding night is always at home! Why isn't your belly getting bigger?… Shrew, speak! Speak, you shrew…"</p>
<p>Like a fierce fire that had been slightly extinguished, suddenly had boiling oil poured on it, my wife's anger and sorrow reached an unprecedented peak. She fell prostrate on the ground again, rolling, bumping, crying and shouting with all her might…</p>
<p>A moment later, she suddenly stopped crying and shouting, rolled over, jumped up, grabbed a pair of rusty scissors from the sewing basket on the table, aimed them at her throat, stabbed, and shot out a fountain of blood. Everyone screamed, and I spread my arms and rushed forward to hug her, but I hugged empty air, and I woke up. I was glad that it was just a dream, but this dream really worried me, because it reminded me of many dreamlike facts.</p>
<p>Suddenly remembering last night's promise, I had to get up quickly to raise money for Zhang's child's corpse…</p>

<p>Shao Baiqing…Zhou Yan</p>
<p>Jin Hanting…Huang He</p>
<p>Jin Bao</p>
<p>This is a rural area outside a county town along the Shanghai-Nanjing railway line. An evening in late autumn and early winter:</p>
<p>Jin Bao is a seventeen-year-old young girl, beautiful and lively. She has a very old father - Zhou Guangyan. The father and daughter depend on each other for life, cultivating more than ten acres of land, and they live a happy life. However, in the past two years, floods and droughts have made their lives difficult. The father borrowed high-interest money from Shao Baiqing, the steward of the landlord Jin's family. Therefore, although this year is a bumper year, the rice in the fields is very full, but before it is time for them to harvest it themselves, Shao Baiqing has sent people to harvest it. Of course, in this way, the landlord Jin's family's rent is also lost. How can they repay it? This question really worried Zhou Guangyan to death!</p>
<p>However, Guangyan thought that the young master of the Jin family loved his daughter Jin Bao very much. He immediately turned this thought to Jin Bao, thinking that if he married Jin Bao to the young master Jin, wouldn't everything be solved?</p>
<p>But what about Jin Bao? Jin Bao is different from other village girls. She has a clear mind. Naturally, she is unwilling to marry the young master Jin, let alone fall in love with him.</p>
<p>Jin Bao and Li Yunge, an honest and brave young man from the same village, had long been in love with each other. Moreover, they had already agreed that Jin Bao would not marry anyone but Yunge, and Yunge would not marry anyone but Jin Bao.</p>
<p>The young master Jin really loved Jin Bao very much. Therefore, he tried all kinds of methods to get Jin Bao. Although Guangyan forced her hard and Qian Baokun coaxed her softly, true love cannot be bought with money and power. Although Yu Bao was oppressed by this feudal remnant force, it did not shake her progress towards a bright future. In the end, she struggled with determination!</p>
<p>Under the oppression of the remaining feudal forces, a tragedy was created!</p>
<p>However, this tragedy is not a surrender. It symbolizes the light of the future!</p>

<h3>The Great Scenery of "Peach Blossom Spring Dream"</h3>
<p>Han Langen and Liu Jiqun cooperated in the film "Such Heroes." Everyone called them the Chinese Laurel and Hardy. Even now, the two of them are indeed the leading slapstick stars in the Chinese film industry. Therefore, it is what movie fans eagerly await, to hire Han Langen and Liu Jiqun again to cooperate in a slapstick film. From a business perspective, the Xinhua Company's "Peach Blossom Spring Dream" is very sure in terms of business.</p>
<p>There is a scene in "Peach Blossom Spring Dream" to set up a great Peach Blossom Spring. Originally, it was prepared to leave Shanghai and go to other places to shoot on location, but now it is decided to build it in the studio. This scene not only requires a large amount of lighting, but also cannot be done without a large open space. Therefore, Xinhua Company plans to build this scene on the 11-acre open space opposite Xietu Road, which was recently purchased. This is the new studio after Xinhua Company expanded. It is expected that when this large scene starts shooting, there will be many people visiting, and there will be five consecutive nights of filming. How grand!</p>
