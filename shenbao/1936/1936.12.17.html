<p>或者說我在尋女孩的開心吧？我當時滿心不舒服，我對於我所住的世界我眞是糊塗起來，其實對於女子說話的顧忌，傳統的我有這個習慣，對於男子打招呼，後天的我也有一點警戒，無論你問路或者打聽什麼，終要看看對方的吃相」；至對於兒童還要當心，這是我從來沒有想到過。但是這個敎訓，是曾够我許多日子的思索的。兒童有什麽心腸？只是上海的環境，使她家庭給她這樣的敎育，對於所有的人類，却抱着顧忌與害怕的心理吧了。可是相反的我在另一方面看到，有一些愛打牌的人，新搬進一個地方，沒有三四天工夫，前前後後的隣居男男女女都弄得非常親密，比同住十年以上還要熟悉，這又是什麽道理呢？這沒有別的，是他們有了同好的地方，從這些同好的地方，把他們表面的虛僞都打破吧了。</p>
<p>兩個人接觸，大家都要擺架子，什麽都不願意告訴人，無論思想，主張，慾求，都不露一切痕跡，結巢兩個人對坐一個兩個鐘頭，一天兩天，互相提防對方是否全看輕我，是否會偷我東西，是否會防我做賊，而一句談話都沒有；卽使有諸，也只是「今天天氣哈哈哈。而已。於是時日一天一天過去，地球都可以套一圈了，而二個人還是遠遠的各裝各的玄妙。我對於這一層永遠不明白是文明的人類所應有的事情，所以在可能范圍之中，我是要設法打破這廥虛偽的。二個人間多數的來說，我相信都有同好的，無論民族多多不同，習慣多多異殊，事實上終有可以談談笑笑的地方，火車上大家很悶，何必死板板對坐，談談說說不是一件比較合理的事情？</p>
<p>所以所有我的旅行，無論是對坐的兵士，是鄕下老，是商人，我終會誠誠懇懇同他談一陣，這幾年我有不少短途的旅行，從那裏我得到許多有趣的經騐。這使我養成一種不就自己所好，則就對方所好的去談，我從那裏得到不少的智識。</p>
<p>在津浦路上，我帮一個鄕下老年人搬一個行李，我同他談了許多話，北方農莊的事情我因此知道不少；並且知道在他的經騐中，所有穿洋裝的洋學生，都是看不起他的，只有我，他說是他第一次見到一個「外國派」的人會同他這樣好。從蘇州到上海的夜輪船裏，因爲輪船中人多地方少，沒有睡。我同一個兵士談許多話，他參加過滬戰，告訴許多滬戰的事，……其他同學生同商人等等談話，更是不計其數。在這些經騐裏，有個有趣的統計是這樣的，大概以年齡論三十五歲以下談性的問題最容易接近，四十以上的則談生活問題容易接近，以階級論，對勞働者談生活容易接近，對其他則談異性容易接近，以地域論，對鄕下人談生活較易接近，（這大概是鄕下人腦筋封建，以爲女子可想而不可談的緣故）對城裏人則談異性容易接近，以職業論，對勞工商人談生活較易接近，對學生及小宮僚　談性色較容易接近。離開道裏，就是談國事，談主張與思想而接近，但這是最占少數，談這些主張與思想是要等接近以後才有的。其實生話與性色，爲人生兩大慾望。孔子曾說「食色性也」，羅素曾以爲人類不是屬於「馬克斯主義」就是屬於「弗羅也特主義」，在我這個有趣的統計中，也得到一點證明了。以後我的談話幾乎有了公式。從報紙或從對方所看的書入手，探探他的思想，引不起他的興趣，就從國事談到生活；或從車外的田地談到收穫，談到他們鄉下的種種，有一次一個坐我對而鄕下靑年在對着窗外唱山歌，我於是同他談女子一直談到他到家。生活引不興趣的人，談異性一定配他胃口。每個人各人的環境不同所以大家都不相同，但在同方面看來也可以有這樣的相同，莊子所謂「自其同者言之，天下齊一也，」就是這個道理。</p>
<p>在船上我也用　個公式，我同許多印度人與西洋人都接近了。一個有趣的發現是這樣的，談性色容易引起西洋人的興趣，談生活則容易引起印度人的興趣，這原因，第一因爲西洋人來東方，都不受經濟的壓迫，而印度人則日日在英國拘束中生存。第二是西洋人對這些兩性的事情看得比較公開，而印度社會社交還沒有公開，所以對於談性色是不習慣的，然這並不是絕對的分別，不過大慨的情形如此，已經够使我們發生興趣了。</p>
<p>對於生活，印度靑年中幾乎個個都有强烈的民族的意識，他們要求自由與解放是非常之切的，這羣印度赴歐留學的靑年，幾乎完全是學醫或者學工程，可是他們對於英國所用於殖民地的許多經濟政策，都有透澈的理解。這是我們同行的中國同學所不及的，我們有許多學醫學理工，甚至於學社會科學的人，都只知道行內一點狹小的技術，對於整個中國的社會，政治與經濟，一點都不知道，有些幾乎連極普通的公民常識都沒有，這一種公民資格的缺少，使我感到卽使他對於醫科工科銀行有很大的研究，他一定會覺得在中國做他行內的事與在滿洲國做事是沒有什麽分別的。幾年來有不少學有專長的留學生都做漢奸了，我想這是一個重要的原因。</p>

<p>長春通訊、日人在我東北之採金事業、據其宣稱、近三年來、呈示大躍進、尤以滿洲採金會社之成績爲高、如日本昭和九年（中華民國二十三年）自六月至十二月、半年間之採金額、爲九十五萬七千五百五十九元、昭和十年度爲三百六十七萬八百四十八元、至本年度由一月至，月爲八白萬元、倘以全年度推算、的可達一千萬元、故每年累增爲二倍、日人鑑於以上採金業之發展與獲利之多、不將採金會社於明年度起、以五年計劃、積極推進產金、現正着手準備進行、又一方面、對於企業詳加調查、以防止產金之逃避與私賣、至其五年計劃實施後之東北產金額、預定爲四億之至五億元、其大綱如左、</p>
<p>（一）五年產金計劃</p>
<p>日本昭和十二年　一千五百萬元</p>
<p>日本昭和十三年　二千二百萬元</p>
<p>日本昭和十四年　三千六百萬元</p>
<p>日本昭和十五年　五千七百萬元</p>
<p>日本昭和十六年　八千二百萬元</p>
<p>（二）採金實施方法</p>
<p>（一）採礦調查之撤底企業合理化、</p>
<p>（二）採金船之增設、（照和十二年五雙次年度再增加數雙）</p>
<p>（三）採金方法之改良機械化、</p>
<p>（四）為促進上揭計劃起見、又實施如下辦法、（一）採金移民之實施　、（二）日本內地資本之誘致、（三）設立技術者養成所、（四）小金廠之合併、（五）充實維持治安之警務力、（六）防止產金逃避密賣徹底化、</p>
<p>最後日人幷抱樂觀稱、東北由明年以降、因產業開發、對通貨之膨脹、定準備正貨之基礎、故對採金事、最有希望、</p>

<p>西安事變。突然發生。全國所仰望之軍事領袖。竟至橫被刦持而失其自由。其他祖負淸剿責任之重要軍官。亦以請謁而集中。並遭暴力之轟留。在外交風雲異常緊張之今日。在綏邊戰事正當進行之時際。而後方竟掀起如此不可測度之風波。貽國人以無法寗靜之震撼情緒使阽危局勢。益增漂搖。團結力量。重歸渙散就爲爲之。孰令致之。張學良無論如何藉口。亦難以自解于國人矣。</p>
<p>中央對於此次突發事變。在悲憤痛切之餘。仍以國事爲重。不欲輕動干戈。故一方僅以褫職查辦維持中央之威信。一方渴望送蔣返京。暗示張氏以自新。數日以來。各方對張勸吿之函電。紛披於報紙。而陝變所予嚴重之影響。未見有轉機。是張學良終無悔悟之意。必欲擾害大局。政府縱有委曲求全之苦衷。至是亦難坐視叛變而不顧。故於昨日經中政會之通過。由國府下討伐之明令。並以何應欽爲討逆總司令。預計討逆軍興。玉石實所難辨在政府以整飭綱紀爲前提。自有其不得不爾之趨勢。而張氏以一手造成之事實。竟令無辜生靈。同罹刦數。破壞團結之局面。摧隳對外之實力。使年來辛苦斡旋之功。歸於泡影。舉國一致殷盼之情。適得其反。吾人之痛心失望。又何如耶。</p>
<p>要之。事已至此。吾人亦雅不欲再爲功罪之論列。惟有萬衆一心鎭靜自處。擁護政府之方針。抱定堅决之步驟。至張氏部下果有悔禍之志。更應及早自　恬。庶幾討逆軍。事得以速了。整個力量。不至毀滅。勿令親者痛而仇者快。吾人所殷切默禱者。如是而已。</p>

<p>上海市防癆展覽會、昨邀丁惠康博士演講「疾病保險興民族健康、」詞極精警、節錄如下、</p>
<p>疾病保險意義</p>
<p>社會愈進步、則人事愈紛繁、人之感受病機亦愈多、醫藥負担亦愈重以普遍家庭論、其收支各項、不難精確預算、惟醫樂一項、則難預測、蓋疾病之來、非意料所及、而醫藥之需、往往罄數年積蓄、而不敷一病之消耗、此尚屬以有能力者言、其限於經濟無力就醫、致遷延貽誤者更衆、此各國疾病保險組織盛行之由來也、故一般家庭將疾病保險費、作必要開支、月納微欵、可省不能預算之醫藥費、藉醫藥之保障、維護個人及家庭之健康幸福、法良意善、莫此爲甚、我國迄今尚無此項組織、憾事也、</p>
<p>各國保險情形</p>
<p>疾病保險組織、分公共及私家兩種公共疾病保險、始於一八七一年、投保者爲職工、所繳費不逾三百金、現以德國而論、投保者約有二千萬人、年納費在十二萬萬馬克以上、美則達三十六萬萬元俄亦有二十五萬萬盧布、其醫學之發展、純賴此項組織、積極建設而成功、此類保險爲强迫者、故店主或經理有報告義務、其費槪由店主或公司担任三分之一、職員担任三分之二、其保費約合月薪之百分之四或七之間、</p>
<p>公共疾病保險</p>
<p>公共疾病保險、完全爲薪給者着想、如住病房、以普通三等爲限、處方不能購服成藥、凡醫生俱劃分診療區域、每醫生應療治病者若干俱有定限、保險機關則每年以總收入之百分之十七或二十、爲醫生治療費、其醫院費用、亦有限制、如漢堡地方之病院、每入每日的費六·八馬克、包括各種手術×光及醫藥費在內、此類投保者患疾病時、俱享有疾病金權益、卽一家主人因病入院、除醫藥費外、其家屬尚有日用金之頜取、</p>
<p>私家疾病保險</p>
<p>私家疾病保險與公共者不同、卽與醫生無特的、可延請其私人醫牛診治、由投保者自行付費於醫生或醫院、然後向保險機關收回之、</p>
<p>我應急起直追</p>
<p>我國現在，一般醫家無固定收入、同時病者亦無力就醫、而醫家各自爲政、無統制合作之方、不特醫學無進化、且影響民族之退化、試觀各國醫學進步與其國民健康爲正比例、故此種疾病保險組織、我國宜急起直追、速謀此項保險組織成立、倘全國聞風興起、則他日普及保險時、卽我國防痰事業及醫學建設成功之日也、</p>

<p>輸出物價指數　總爲九七·一、較上月漲百分之一·〇、較去年同月漲百分之八·四、三類指數與七月比數、一致見漲、生產品所漲較多、消費品原料品所漲較少、生產品漲百分之二·五、白廠經歐美市塲一致猛漲、以本月十四日比上月十五日紐約所開滬白廠經每磅市價計自美金一·六三元漲至一·八三元、英法絲市趨勢亦同、復因國內秋繭歉收、繭價高漲、　本加重、本市每擔售價遂自上月之七四〇元漲至本月之八三〇元、棉紗·柏油價亦趨昂、惟白桐油以新貨來源漸旺、生油實銷呆滯、豆油連市見成、售盤皆跌、否則該類指數漲率尙不止此、消費品漲百分之一·〇、豬油以貨缺猝漲、雞蛋因値銷令、與粗布麵粉等同　堅昂、原料品漲百分之〇·四、生鐵·純銻·乾繭以至存貨兩缺、錫塊以海外報漲、各漲一成有奇、豬髮·廢絲·衫木同吿上漲、因之該類中之動物產·林產·鑛產指數一致上升、惟輸出大宗之豐產、則以黃豆·豆餅隨同連市跌落、生仁到湧去滯、與靑豆·棉子餅同趨疲跌、指數猶較上月　低、而原料品指數之漲勢亦因之和緩焉、（未完）</p>

<p>— 張樹英</p>
<p>—潛水艇發明家</p>
<p>潛水艇是現代科學兵器中最重要的武器，牠在戰爭上的重要性，與飛機相等。我們只消從列強幾次在軍縮會議上，對於潛水艇增減及廢棄否的爭點看來，就可明白潛水艇是點着如何重要的位置了。</p>
<p>以目下各國潛水艇設備的完備，與及潛水艇數量之多，定有人懷疑，潛水艇的發明一定很早，且歷史很長吧。其實潛水艇的完全成功，不過距今二三十年，卽歐洲大戰前數年的事，就是最初研究潛水艇，和發明製造模型，也不過是百年以前的事，想不到科學家們只經過幾十年的努力，就製出現代非常完備的潛水艇來，雖然潛水艇是戰爭利器，是以擾亂世界和平，但是完成之連　及對科學貢獻之大，真是令人驚嘆。所以對於發明潛水艇的經過，及發明潛水艇的偉人，我們不單是應該明白，並且值得十分欽佩，霍蘭就是這麼值得我們欽佩的人，他以愛國心，和百折不撓的精神，雖遭幾次失敗，終於得以成功。</p>
<p>霍蘭是於一八四一年，在英國愛爾蘭生的，他的家　很好，自幼得受充分教育，後來在愛爾蘭修道院當先生，他在修道院內，一有空閒，就潛心作潛水艇的研究，這個時候，恰遇美國發生南北戰爭，他　　厄立刻孫（John　Ericsion　1802-1880）替北軍建造鐵甲車，參加戰爭，得到勝利的消息，竟引起他莫大的興趣，和將來最大的一個希望。</p>
<p>霍蘭的希望就是要他的祖國愛爾蘭脫離英國的支配，成為完全獨立的國家。但是當時英國強有力的海軍，正是阻礙他達到這一日的最大障礙物，現在厄立克孫文發明鐵甲軍艦，那麼愛爾蘭的獨立，只有成為夢想，絕無成功的希望了，霍蘭旣有如此大希望，要為祖國的獨立而努力，第一就不能不發明一　能制肘海軍前進及低於鐵甲軍艦的東西不可，這就是學研究製造潛水艇最大的動機。他想潛水艇，能潛入水底，必定可以在敵人不知中擊破敵人軍艇，在戰爭上獲得勝利。</p>
<p>霍蘭有此發明潛水艇的動機後，於是潛心研究潛水艇的製造和先輩研究所得的結果，他由書中知道最初製出潛水艇模型的，為荷蘭人普勒布爾（Cornelis　Von　Prebbel　1742-1826）；後來在美國獨立戰爭的時候，美國人部士涅爾（Danid　Bushnell　1742-1826）曾經製出比較完全的潛水艇，這種潛水艇只有水手　人，用人力潛入水底，可經半小時，但是後來試驗潛擊停泊於紐約港的英國軍艦，結果竟遭失敗，可見製造極為簡單，機關尚不完善，故未能使用。</p>
<p>其次研究潛水艇的，為發明汽船的福爾敦（Robert　Fulton　1765-1815），他起初在美國政府提議製造潛水艇，未得通過，後來又在外國提議，因為沒有得人信用，所以也沒有引起人們的注意和許可，但他自己又沒有力量製造，故在失望中竟對潛水艇斷念。</p>
<p>其後在美國南北戰爭中，雖曾有潛水艇的製造，且南軍的潛水艇曾將北軍戰鬥艦擊沉海底，但構造均極簡單，尚未十分適用。</p>
<p>霍蘭見到這些先輩對於潛水艇的製造和研究，都沒有得到完全成功，所有决心自己來做潛水艇的完成者。他在十七歲時往美國，在波士頓上陸，不幸這位有志的靑年，最初到這塊新大陸後，就得一種慢性病，醫生要他在病院裏作長時期的修養，不想他竟因此長時期的養病，得到潛心研究潛水艇的機會，想出種種製造潛水艇的方法。</p>
<p>一八七五年，就是霍蘭三十五歲那年，他最初製成一隻極小潛水艇，但因製造尚未完備，放到水上，就突入泥中，全艇破壞無餘，這種潛水艇為葉卷烟型，長十六呎，中央寬為二尺，人坐在艇之中央，起蹈推進機，就可以前進，名為霍蘭第一號。第一號失敗後，他毫不灰心，繼續製造第二號，但因第二號亦未加以改良，以致又蹈覆轍。霍蘭經過兩次失敗，經驗愈多，他更自信，自己必能完成這個偉大的使命，所以他更繼續努力研究。因為他一面研究，一面又從事愛爾蘭的獨立運動，並且他所研究的潛水艇，又為達到獨立目的的工具，所以要為他的研究得到幾萬元的費用很容易，因此他很快又製造了兩隻潛水艇。</p>
<p>霍蘭的潛水艇，與前輩所造的很不相同，以前的至少須數分鐘才能完全進水，但霍蘭的只消幾秒鐘就可進入水的深處，在水中完全能自由活動。霍蘭第三號第四號製出後，他對於潛水艇的研究，已經得　相當的成功，他於是辭去教職，注全力研究更完善的潛水艇。</p>
<p>一八八八年，霍蘭好容易得到美國國務總理的贊成，許可美國海軍採用潛水艇，不幸在這許可後不久，就發生華盛頓政變，不能實行，及至一八九三年，美國海軍部再容納他的意見，製造勃蘭額號潛水艇，但因華盛頓政府的技師，不同意霍蘭一部分的設計，結局不免歸於失敗，霍蘭非常憤恨，氣忿忿交回政府九千元的代價，取回潛水艇，再依自己的設計製造新艦，名為「霍蘭號」，這隻霍蘭號就是現代式潛水艇最初的第一隻，長五十三呎十吋，深十呎七吋。這隻潛水艇製出後不久，正遇美國與西班牙發生戰爭，但保守的美國政府，仍不願採用新兵器潛水艇，為擊沈敵艦之工具。</p>
<p>一九〇〇年秋，美國政府才漸漸知道潛水艇偉大的能力，開始收買「霍蘭號」潛水艇，並向霍蘭定製六隻同樣的霍蘭潛水艇，經過一次大演習後，海軍將校們，都非常佩服潛水艇的威力。此時霍蘭已得到莫大的光榮，從此其他各國海軍，也是爭先恐後的採用潛水艇。</p>
<p>一九一四年潛水艇於九月二十二日擊沈英國戰鬥艦數隻，這正是發明潛水艇的偉人霍蘭逝世後一月零十天的事情</p>

<p>— 蘇子涵</p>
<p>—好漢是甯死不辱的—</p>
<p>自從金國的大兵攻破了汴京，把徽宗欽宗兩位皇帝捉了去，另外立了大漢奸張宗昌做皇帝，宋朝的天下就幾乎完結了。幸虧那時高宗從金營逃脫了性命，渡過黃河，在南京登了基，各處的勤王兵馬，忠臣義士都到了南京，總算保住了南邊的半邊天下。</p>
<p>旣然立定了基業，便應該調渡人馬，渡過黃河，同金兵拼命抗戰，好收復失地，洗雪國恥。不想高宗并不這樣做，聽信一般只顧自己享受富貴榮華，不管國家大事的臣子們的話，老守在南邊當皇帝，反把收復失地，洗雪國恥不當一回事。於是把一個忠肝義膽的東京留守宗澤，活活急死，宗留守臨死的時候還大呌着「過河去！」像這樣有血氣，有膽識，忠肝義膽的臣子，高宗竞自不能重用，真是可惜。</p>
<p>高宗儘管在南邊享福，但是金兵絕不會放鬆他，等到秋高草肥，人強馬壯的時候，又派遣人馬，浩浩蕩蕩的殺向南方來。那時守黃河隘口將官裏面，又出了兩個漢奸，賣國求榮，獻了隘口；宗澤的後任杜充，也是個只知道自己不知道國家的傢伙，看見金兵勢大，也投降了。於是黃河南面起，一直到長江北岸，沒有一處沒有金兵，也沒有一處不被金兵騷擾了。</p>
<p>那時高宗正在平江，金兵旣然殺來了，便應該趕緊到南京去，調兵遣將，同金兵抗戰。長江天險，金兵插翅也飛不過來，縱然不得勝，也可以守啊！無奈高宗并不這樣做，反轉聽信黃潛善汪伯彥這些沒用傢伙的話，金兵剛把揚州攻破，就丟掉平江，沒命的向杭州跑，隨後連杭州都　不住了，一直跑到明州，入了海，才算住了腳。</p>
<p>這樣一來，金兵却得其所哉了，毫不費力，便渡過長江，攻破南京，攻破平江，隨着高宗的背後，也一直趕到海上才罷。但是，海邊的百姓却遭了瘟了。如果高宗不丟掉平江，憑着長江的天險，同金兵抗戰，金兵未必能得到便宜，也許還會落一個片甲不回呢。</p>
<p>且住，官家雖然這樣不成材料，百姓裏面可有不少有志氣的，忠肝義膽的人物，不甘心做亡國奴呢。</p>
<p>話說那時候平江　兩個百姓，一個姓劉明鼐，一個姓張名鰲。這兩朋友都是汴京人氏。因為汴京破了，張宗昌賣國，他兩朋友氣憤不過，自己又沒有權力，辦不出什麽事來，只好怨天恨地。隨後聽見高宗在南京登基，兩朋友高興得了不得，便聚在一道商議，一同到南方去，兩朋友商議好了，便收拾動身。好在張鰲沒有家，劉鼐也只有一個妻子，走起來并不麻煩。</p>
<p>到了南邊，劉鼐同張鰲二人就在平江住下了，各人尋了一個小本經營，對付過活。</p>
<p>俟後高宗到了平江，平江就熱鬧起來，頗有些太平景像，大家都安安靜靜的過起日子來。不想金兵野心不足，又興兵爭奪中國的天下，消息一天比一天不好，於是便把大家的好夢驚破了。</p>
<p>劉鼐知道金兵又來了的消息便去找着張鰲到：「我聽見一個不好的信息，說金兵又來了，并且渡過了黃河，攻破了汴京，杜充那狗娘養的也降了！兄弟，你知道不知道？」</p>
<p>張鰲答道：「哥哥，我早知道了。這回皇上該要出兵去同金兵打仗了，打他個落花流水，不止是要把汴京奪過來，就是黃河北邊的地方也應該奪過來，才算對得住百姓，對得住祖宗呢！」</p>
<p>劉鼐道：「那也難說，你想，岳爺現在湖廣剿匪，韓將等也在長江上流，皇上身邊還有什麽好將，不過只剩下黃潛善汪伯彥這些狗娘養的濃包罷了。他們有膽量去向金兵拚命嗎？兄弟，你說。」</p>
<p>張鰲道：「皇上從前能夠從金營裏逃走，單人獨馬的跑到南邊，創出基業來，這膽量見識就不小。他總不應該聽見金兵來了，就如同老鼠聽見貓呌，還沒看見影子就逃了。我們等着瞧吧。」</p>
<p>劉鼐道：「對！我們等着瞧吧。好在我的心老早就定了，這條命遲早都要同金兵拚了的。」</p>
<p>張鰲道：「是啊，到了時候自然是要拚命的。」</p>
<p>兩朋友說到沒有話說的時候，便分手了。</p>
<p>金兵攻破了揚州，平江的百姓們雖然知道了這個不好的消息，但是到還鎮靜，一點也沒有慌亂。本來，揚州離平江還遠，並且還隔一條長江啊！不想官家却鎮不住，早溜到杭州去了。</p>
<p>官家一溜，真不成了。百姓們都想着：「官家一走，分明不要平江了，金兵也自然要佔平江了。金兵要來，我們怎麽辦呢」？</p>
<p>大街上全是人，來來往往，慌慌張張，都是找朋友，找親戚，想商議一個善全之策的。</p>
<p>劉鼐也找到張鰲了。一見面，劉鼐就一把抓着張鰲的手，大呌道：「兄弟，我的話怎樣？那些狗娘養的不是誆供着皇上跑了嗎？真不是東西」！</p>
<p>張鰲也大呌道：「那樣一個皇帝，會跑！國家也不要了，土地也不要了，百姓也不要了，真想不到啊！哥哥，現在是時候了」！</p>
<p>劉鼐道：不錯，現在是時候了，是我們報答國家的時候了！</p>
<p>張鰲道：「不過，哥哥，你這有嫂嫂啊！」</p>
<p>劉鼐道：「兄弟，別那們說，現在是甚麽時候，還顧得了要多。兄弟，你那嫂嫂也是明白人。我向她說：『爲了我們的國家，爲了我們的民族，我要同金兵拚命去了。你年紀輕輕的，又沒兒女，你再走一步吧，別記着我』！你睜著兩眼，說：『你拚命去得了。別拿話擠兌我。你瞧我的。』說着他就轉身走了，哈！兄弟，她抹脖子死了！死得好！她是大宋的好子民，是我劉鼐的好妻子……」</p>
<p>張鰲接上了：「是我張鰲的好嫂嫂」！</p>
<p>劉鼐道：「想拚命的一定不止你我兩個人，兄弟，我們到大街上約人去」！</p>
<p>張鰲道：「好的」。</p>
<p>兩朋友已經到大街上了。大街上還是那樣亂，並且有的還担着箱籠包裹，準備逃走了。</p>
<p>劉鼐大呌道：「不要走啊！走不得的啊」！</p>
<p>有人回答：「不走，等金兵來砍腦袋嗎」？</p>
<p>劉鼐大呌道：「不是這樣說，你走，金兵不會跟來嗎？腦袋仍然保不住。現在官家不要平江了，我們百姓可要，這是大宋的土地啊！我們大家團結起來，同金兵拚命，不就把平江保着了，把自己的身家妻兒也保守了嗎？不要走啊！與其走了還是死，不如同金兵拚命還死得痛快啊」！</p>
<p>張鰲也大呌道：「做亡國奴還是死，拚命也是死，這樣死多痛快啊！殺一個人夠本，殺兩個人賺錢啊」！</p>
<p>呌的儘管呌，走的還是走且住，難道就沒有一個熱血的人嗎？不，熱血的人有的是。瞧！人　裏早跳出二三百個年靑人來，異口同聲的大呌道：「好漢子！我願意同二位好漢去同金兵拚命」！</p>
<p>劉鼐大呌道：「好啊！我們生是大宋的人，死是大宋鬼，呌金兵嘗嘗我們槍尖刀頭的滋味」。</p>
<p>大家也都大呌道：「好啊！好漢領頭，我們找金兵拚命！拚命去！」</p>
<p>一片呌喊震動了天地。</p>
<p>金兵來得真快。</p>
<p>金兵破了揚州，輕輕易易就過了長江，得了南京，一路上也沒有人抵擋他們，浩浩蕩蕩的殺來，不幾天就到了平江</p>
<p>金兵到了平江，還　有消息，早從盤門裏湧出一隊勇士來；為首的便是劉鼐同張鰲。兩朋友每人手挺着一條死槍，一言不發，帶着那隊勇士便殺進金兵陣裏來。</p>
<p>金兵出其不意，到被這隊瘋狂猛虎冲亂了，俟後覺得只不過這一點人，便大家圍上混殺，劉鼐　張鰲領着大家在陣裏左冲右突，殺得屍橫遍地，血流成渠，金兵死了不少，無奈眾寡不敵，手下人漸漸死完，劉鼐也陣亡了。</p>
<p>張鰲看見事情不能成功，便想道：「難道還拿結他們提去受辱嗎？不如死了好」。張鰲主意定了，便一面殺一面退，殺到護城河邊，便湧身一跳，跳在護城河裏死了。</p>
<p>金兵死了千萬人，才得了平江。</p>
<p>過後平江人佩服劉鼐張鰲兩朋友的忠義，便在盤門外靈岩鄉修了一座雙忠祠來紀念他們。</p>

<h3 id="c210">「教育播音講演集」 <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— 彬</p>
<p>第一集　民眾教育篇</p>
<p>教育播音講演集第一集（民眾教育篇）是和教育播音講演集第　集（中等教育篇）同時由教育部編輯，由商務印書倌出版的。後者已經由筆者作文介紹過，這裏，只談談前者吧。這本集子在編輯上共分四類：　公民訓練；　科學常識；　時事講演；　國語訓　；所收演詞共計二十九篇。首先，談談材料的支配。從每類材料的量方面來看，這本集子可算恰到好處。公民訓練類包括演詞計九篇，科學常識類包括演詞十四篇，時事講演類五篇，國語訓練類一篇：材料的支配很是輕重相宜。</p>
<p>但是，說到材料的種類方面，這本集子還有不足和遺漏的缺點。如：在公民訓練類裏，有一種為現在所急需的訓練，却不曾被收　在內，那就是關於國防時期的公民訓練。凡是解釋我國現在所處的環境和危機一類的演詞，可以列入於時事講演類；凡是說明國防時期公民應有的覺悟和職務一類的演詞，可以收入於公民訓練類；凡是介紹有　國防的科學知識一類的演詞，可以收入於科學常識類。但是，這本集子却不曾注意到這　方面的材料。這一點，當然不能由編輯者負責的，而應該由教育播音講演的主辦人員負責的。</p>
<p>又如：在公民訓編類，應該搜集幾篇關於從業的修養，事業和謀業一類的問題；在科學常識類，應該添增幾篇關於分類職業常識一類的演詞。但是，這本集子却又不曾把這些材料注意過。此外，還有一些必要材料，如：關於民眾藝術教育和訓練一類的演詞，也不曾為這本集子所注意過。其實，這一類材料和民眾教育，有着很密切的關係。我們只好希望：以後的教育播音演講，要注意到上述的那些材料才好。</p>
<p>其次，讓我們從這本集子的材料的質方面，來加以一番概要的評論吧。在我們讀過了二十九篇演詞之後，便覺得無一不是民眾所急切需要的知識。尤其以公民訓練類的演詞九篇演詞，和科學常識類的十四篇演詞，對於真理的分析，事物的說明，都極其詳盡而淺明。像這種性質的演詞，當然容易的一般民眾所理解。</p>
<p>現在，且舉出兩篇演詞來論述一下。如：謝冠生所講的公民的權利和義務，對講題的解釋，可說是十分正確而精細的。在演詞的開端，他說明了公民和人民的區別。接着，闡明了公民的條件，那就是：　積極的條件；　消極的條件；　更在這兩類條件之下，舉出了若干種。其次便是公民的權利，包括：　私權；　公權；又在這兩類權利之下，列出若干種。以後便是公民的義務，分為：　納稅；　兵役；　教育；　服從。最後，他在結論裏表示了這樣的主張：「總括的說，具備了公民的條件，而完畢　義務，然後享有各種權利，這才是三民主義的法制之下一個完全的良好的公民。」一般民眾聽了這樣的演詞，就可以明瞭他們和國家政府的種種關係了</p>
<p>另一篇我們所以要談的，便是陳運嬀所講的國歷的好處。本來，曆法一類的題目，是頗不容易講的，但是，她却能講得很詳細而又通俗，這是難得的成績。在演詞的起首，她根據地球的兩種運動，年，月，日的成因，以及人類生活的受天象的支配等，把　的定義分析得極其明白。接着，她把中國的甲子記日法和外國的星期法，比較的加以說明。再者，又講到了中國用歷的四個時期，更舉出了陰陽混合歷的三種壞處。於是，進而比較舊曆和國歷的組成法；最後，才講到了國歷的好處。關於這一點，她從國歷的本身上，和社會生活上來講，尤其注重於後一方面。像　類民眾所急需知道而又極難解釋的題目，她卻有條有理的，講得很仔細，很易於了解。所以，我們把這篇認為是同類演詞中最好的一篇。</p>
<p>除了上述的兩篇演詞之外，還有些也是很精彩的；如：陳大齊所講　公民與道德，張厲生所講的中國爲什麽要實行三民主義，和張鈺哲所講的宇宙淺說等篇。總之，教育播音講演是新興的民眾教育的利器，我們希望此後不斷的舉行。同時，教育播音講演集，我們也希望繼續的編輯，印行，和推廣，藉文字的力量以補播音的不及。不過，在播音演講的材料方面，希望主辦者極力的擴充，沒有一點遺漏才好</p>

<p>——商務出版——</p>
<p>第三，讓我們來論；陳之邁的怎樣研究政治制度？吧。在篇首，他說明了幾種政治制度的研究法，卽；哲學的，歷史的，比較的，和綜合的　種方法。在篇末，他發表了對政治制度的認識；詳細來說，為：㈠政治制度是人類社會的組織之一；㈡政治制度的優劣無絕對的標準；　取中西政治制度之長而去其短的辦法，是永不能實現的。像現在這樣的認識，尤其以第二，第三點為　，可說是很卓越的見解。初學者讀了這篇文章，便對政治制度有一個正確的觀念和認識。</p>
<p>第四，為阮毅成的怎樣研究法律學？首先，他說明了法律學由玄學變為科學的經過；接着，闡明了法律學的，科學研究方法。他　棄法律學的註釋研究方法，而提倡科學研究方法：這是治法律　的人應有的轉變。</p>
<p>第五，我們　談談鍾魯齊的怎樣研究教育學？吧。他把研究教育學的方法，分為普通的，和特殊的兩大類。在普通類的方法之下，又別為三點，卽：　認定門類；　收集資料；　辨出閱讀的資料。在特殊類方法之下，又　為四點，卽：　選擇適當的問題；　採用合宜的方法；　尋求充分的證據；　構成精確的報吿。他的結論是這樣的：「總之，研究教育學，要精准，要淵博，要致用，又要用科學方法使教育學變為真正的科學　好。」鍾氏研究教育學的方法，和阮氏研究法律學的方法是相同的。實在，科學方法是現代人研究各種學術的，最適當的方法。</p>
<p>第六，蔣伍蠡甫的怎樣研究西洋文學　。伍氏像阮氏和鍾氏一樣，也是不把某一種學術看作孤立的，必須和其他學術，尤其是社會科學，發生關係。所以，他在講西洋文學研究方法的根據時，便把「社會科學的見地」列為第一項。其次，必須注意到中國所處的，特殊的地位，這是第二項。第三項，便是應依照中國學生的需要。由於這三項的道理，他主張：中國人研究西洋文學，應有獨自的，研究目的和方法，不必模傲他國人。他又反對：教授用歐美的教授方法，給中國學生講西洋文學；或者只注意到外國語言的價值，而忽略文學的內容。此外，他認為：研究西洋文學的目的，應與方法一致；卽是，先决定一個正確的目的，然後再決定研究的方法。至於研究的意見和準備，也有獨特的見解，可以糾正一般講西洋文學者的錯誤。</p>
<p>其他如：袁道豐的怎樣研究國際政治？，和陳禮江的如何研究民眾教育？等篇，對於所論的學術，都有新穎而正確的解釋，和適當的研究方法。總之，讀書指導第二輯不論在材料和內容兩方面，對讀者可說盡了指導的能事。（完）</p>
<h3 id="c212">怎樣研究哲學（四） <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>

<p>王特夫著　三江書店發行</p>
<p>六，哲學的批判研究：</p>
<p>在哲學研究中，批判的研究方法是有其廣泛的需要的；爲了要正確地接收歷史上的正當的哲學遺產，爲了要能刮除哲學歷史所存的一切殘廢的　滯，爲了要能認識一切哲理學說之理論體系的本身，爲了要能正確地評斷一切哲學思想的價值，甚至爲了要能在研究中發展自己的哲學思維，獲得新的認識與理論，建立自己的哲學體系等等，都有其必要，這是很明白的道理。然而怎樣進行批判的研究呢？要理解一個時代的一種具體的哲學，並對這哲學給予一種批判的研究，那麽首先就得從批判那一時代起，首先就得批判地去研究和理解那一時代的現實生活。此外還應該對於一定的哲學者的身分和生活形態，做一種個人的獨立的批判，才能真正認識和評價他的哲學。如此說來，我們要理解一種哲學，要對這哲學加以批判，那麽　主要的是明瞭　哲學者的時代背景和階級背景，從時代的批判和階級批判中去批判那哲學；其次是從他的個人生活過程的批判中去批判他的哲學。我們應最後地區分析出一定的哲學之某些部份可以成為歷史的正當遺產而接收起來，成為　哲學的內容，並以此去發展自己的哲學思想，形成自己的新的哲學體系，這才算是研究工作的完成。</p>

<p>— 離騷</p>
<p>天氣一冷，上海街頭的特殊形態，不是皮貨店裏大减價的花花綠綠的旗幟，不是聖誕老人笑嘻嘻地在櫥窗要出現，而是癟三乞丐那種凍得索索抖抖的神情。要說人類不是感情的動物，那倒也未必盡然，因爲也有看了這副神情而大動惻隱之念的，如施粥廠及臨時庇寒所的設立等。</p>
<p>這兩個機關的實際情形怎樣，我不大明瞭，但據報上的記載，顯然都是慈善性質的；不管它時期怎樣短促，收容怎樣有限，但造福貧民，比口惠而實不至的，却兩樣得多。</p>
<p>不過這個社會上，獨多的是唱高調的義士。這些義士們，平時總是躲在人家背後，甚至一言不發，但等到有一種新的事物出現，他們便振振有詞起來。他們的說話大致都有一定的公式，除了劈頭一下要駁倒你之外，接着便威慨系之地發一頓牢騷。結果呢，「頭腦淸楚」「澈底解决」一類的讚美，往往是歸諸他們的。但「頭腦淸楚」不過是淸楚而已，而「澈底解决」也不過口頭說說吧了，好在倒楣的是另有一種人在。</p>
<p>例如庇寒所等，當然也免不掉他們的指摘的。第一便是不該「臨時」，爲什麽要臨時呢？難道這些貧民只有這三個月該收容嗎？經過這個三個月之後，他們便有了生路嗎？這是不澈底－其次是，貧民實在太多，這樣的收容，是不是能够儘量呢？如其不能儘量，那又誰是該被摒在門外的？這是不普遍－但義士們的資任，好像祗是喊出「不澈底」與「不普遍」爲止，至於如何可以普遍，如何可以澈底，那又是「說來話長」，只好「略過不表」了。</p>
<p>我倒也並不是反對澈底論的：我擁護澈底。不過　於「高調」的澈底，實在不敢附和，因爲它的影響所及，眼前就要倒楣的，是那班冷得索索抖抖的人們。至於他們自己，在高調唱出之後，立卽就會把這事忹忘懷，因為他們主要的職務就是「唱」，而「唱」也不限於某一事件，遇到其他方面有「唱」出的必要時，誰能禁止他們引吭高歌？</p>
<p>對於臨時庇寒所和施粥廠的設立現在現社會制度之下，原有可以非議的地方，不過事實擺在眼前，如果單唱「高調」，就連這短促時期中所收容的少數難民，也要遭受嚴重的打擊，與其看他們在高調之下冷死餓死，那末讓他們喝碗薄粥，睡睡稻草，也不見得就有什麽罪過。但是，國人生就的習性是不可以不注意的，那便是經手人的廉潔問題，就監察院所彈劾的案件而論，我們知道連某些官吏都有貪污之嫌，何况慈善機關－也就因爲是慈善的關係，只要一個人上下其手，多少人的肚子要遭受到災殃，所以在目前情勢之下，最低限度，我們要求他們賬目公開，一方面可以取信於拿出錢來的眞正慈善家，一方面使災黎所能享受得到的待遇，也得到保障。但這種呼喊，比之高調，也似乎差得遠了！</p>

<p>— 羅鬱</p>
<p>有一年初冬，我住在T埠的南市貧民區里。在一個寒冷的晚上，我穿過車鈴和年霓燈眩耀着的租界，步到那片黑色的垃圾的崗巒上去，最初使我吃驚的，是一個凍僵了的裸露，黑暗裏的肉體，牠像一段伐倒的枯樹，在道旁棄着。</p>
<p>那處，在三百米內沒有行人，祗有一條塡滿黑色散兵綫的陽溝，醜陋的橫在路前。我在寒氣包圍中覺得骨悚，急忙逃過那塊小板橋，找那些熟識的年靑人去。</p>
<p>後來我聽說，那些屍體多半是烟鬼，他們可以不吃飯，不住店，打了馬非睡在冬夜露天的狗窩裏，這原是不值得我們憐憫的。</p>
<p>在貧民區裏的碼頭工人們，卽使餓着肚子，也要想法住店。在傍晚天，他們揑着一搓銅元，默默地走進小店裏，那些住店的還是平日的伙伴們，彼此探問着，再睡在一個板坑上，他們可以不去想那些被風雪給擊倒的。</p>
<p>有一天朝晨，我起身出門是五六點鐘光景，天還陰沉沉的，夜間的小雪仍一在悄悄地飄零，地上的積雪很薄，飴終未蓋住初冬底殘溫，像放在黃米糕上的白糖，隨着輕輕的蒸汽融解着。我穿了一身簡便的工人短裝，雖是破舊，却儘能遮住寒氣；而且那成了習慣的熟睡，給了我洋溢的生命，於是毫不猶預地向碼頭去。</p>
<p>當我走到那條十字小巷底拐角，看到在濡濕的融雪地上，有一個活的人在仰睡着，我是看慣了，可是，他底衣服引起我底注意。那衣服是整齊的，一件黑色的棉袍，一件舊布馬褂，被他底兩膝支起的袍子上面已積了一層融雪。他兩隻手半握着，像一個賽跑選手。</p>
<p>我十分冷靜地觀察着這和寒威搏鬬着的生命。牠們確實是在肉搏着。他底樣子只不過廿歲，兩眼合着，翻出紅色的眼肉，樣子十分可怕。那臉上的融雪像一條小蛇繞過他底耳根，漸漸地殺害着這個流浪的靑年人。他底嘴上湧着白沫，噴着咀咒般的齒音。</p>
<p>我抬起頭時，看到在巷口處，有一個中年的佝僂的人，像在小便。他繞過去，走進一家小店裏去了。我疑惑，這個人是不是來想扒這流浪者底衣裳的呢，這是常有的事，而且在這景况是不會給人看見，地上看不淸的脚印，一層黑色的泥，一層菲薄的雪。</p>
<p>這樣的印象已不能感動我了。我祗想：這個流浪者未必是那些烟鬼中的一個，看衣服是鄉下人的，不像久混城市苦力的模樣。我一邊想着，已走到租界底馬路上了。</p>
<p>老遠有一輛電車駛過去，發出了淸澈的寒冷的鈴聲。街沿上沒有一條生命，平行的兩行街樹底肢膈間疊起未融解的白雪。我在柏油路上擦擦地踏過去，這時只有很少的工人走向河沿去。</p>
<p>忽然像有什麼東西在我底腦子裏炸裂了似的，使我停住了。我想到那一晚所碰見的屍體，同在那一晚我所到過的一間破屋。那是一座低矮的土房，窗紙透出着燈光，當我縮身走進時，專面是暖烘的，在坑沿上有三個年靑人都靠近了一隻舊煤爐子，在那爐子邊上放着一雙發臭的破靴子。他們底衣那很薄，另外一個蹲在坑上用破被裏着他自己，只露出一個臉來。　半截隔板後邊是另一間屋，好幾個漢子鑽攢着頭在賭牌，不時還傳過來一陣沉悶的吵聲。</p>
<p>我記得那個用被子裏着身子的年靑人是不很多說話的。但我知道他是從T埠不遠的一個鄉下跑來的。他底突出的前額很明顯地刻劃着他底鄉土性，眼光是含糊地帶着疑惑。這就是什麼使我吃驚地回憶起來又停住脚步的。</p>
<p>我急忙回頭走，順着原路，想去救一救那個可憐的傢伙，我已記不淸他底名字，可是他底臉孔却活活地湧進我底腦子。</p>
<p>雪還在下着。我走得很快，但是心裏盼望最好那還是一個陌生人，因爲陌生人底死是看慣了的。可是隨着潮濕的脚步，我底心卜卜地跳動起來了。</p>
<p>我已轉入那十字小巷中。等到到了那處拐角時，在一堵土墻根下，一具枯稜的肢體，偏放在泥水中，那個面孔已滾了很多泥漿，但最可怕的是那我所熟識的突出的頭蓋骨。他已經停止了掙扎，而任雪花徐徐撒在他底皮膚上。</p>
<p>在薄雪上還留着一排快將消失的脚印，向巷口的小店那面踏過去。在那爲雪呑下了的人底身旁，只有一雙破舊的靴子放在雪上，那是我曾在一個火爐邊上睥見的頗有年齡的一雙靴子中的一隻。</p>
<h3 id="c215">山轎 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— 羅</p>
<p>所謂山轎，祗是一隻籐椅架兩支竹槓，到杭州進香的人大槪都有過坐這種籐轎的經騐。但是山轎之所以要這樣簡單化，就是要爬山時使抬轎的轎夫輕便，而坐轎的也可以减少危險。困居在都市里的人，看到杭州的山，已經抱驚懼之心了，從靈隱上北高峯去，有一段山路是非常狹窄的，徒步爬山的人因爲祗注意着脚邊的山路，一點也不覺得危險，坐轎的雖然可以自己不費一點氣力，安閑地在轎里抽着烟捲，極目四望，領略那窄如玉帶的錢塘，或隱的可見的房屋；但正因爲安閑，偶然把目光移到轎身下面的山路時，就彷彿在空中飛行，在轉折的地方，更像轎身馬上要傾跌下去似的，而前面後面轎夫的四條腿，却堅捷地在搬動，他們是一脚一脚踏實在石級上，謹愼地，飛速地，想早些到達山峯，他們也可以在大寺前的石欄上坐下來休息一會，或者還有一杯凉茶可喝。坐轎的人往往不會這樣想的，甚至他們忘去了到杭州來的唯一功德—燒香，他們的目光愈收愈近的時候，沒有不是想到轎夫的腿偶然踏空了一脚，以致連人帶轎，從半山腰跌下去，而粉身碎骨。膽怯的奶奶太太們，情願跑出轎來用爬山杖支着，慢慢地爬一截路，讓山轎跟在後面。果然她們飾詞是很漂亮的：「燒香要誠心，最好從山脚一直爬到山頂。」看見盤坐在山的轉灣角上的茅山道人，一個也不遺漏的佈施着香金。但是爬過了一節路，她們又想到旣已化了錢僱着山轎，還費力地爬山有些寃枉，而况走平路的時候也覺得脚心痛的奶奶太太們。她們的念頭又轉了過來，坐了長途火車來燒香，上山時坐一陣山轎也不能不說誠心虔意了，菩薩能够原諒的。可是再坐到轎子里山是更高了，她們又不安心轎夫的腿不要踏空了一脚。有一位太太曾對我說過她上山燒香時的心理分析或許也是一般奶奶太太們的爬山心理吧？自己也曾翻過杭州的山，不過沒有坐過山轎，無從知道自家坐在山轎里時要吾驚惶失措？這一次遊黃山的時候却坐了山轎的，以黃山去比之杭州的峯眞是不可同日而語了；但是以坐黃山山轎的心理去推測坐杭州山轎時的心理，却可以見大槪了。黃山的風景我無法加以描寫，坐在轎里，我的眼睛就沒有空閑的時間去偷窺轎夫的腿。山路大槪更狹窄，而且削直的，轎夫們常常把竹槓提在手里而不是掮在肩脊上。在轉折的地方，前面的轎夫就提着竹槓，後而的轎夫却高舉着過頭頂，看來轎子像附</p>

<p>着地面似的，卽使下臨深淵，我也决不會想到連人帶轎做異鄉之鬼的。因爲要試騐自己的膽量，我也曾注視着前面轎夫的腿，但是搬動得太快了，連山路都看不淸楚，頗有些騰雲駕霧的樣子。那末，連人帶轎翻身下去的時候，恐怕也不會想到跌下去後的危險，而祗是山在自己眼前旋轉罷了。我沒有坐過飛機，不過以這次坐山轎的經騐，看來有機會坐飛機的時候也决不會想到詩人徐志摩是怎樣死去的。</p>

<h3 id="e1">National Government Orders the Punishment of Zhang Xueliang; Appoints He Yingqin as Commander-in-Chief of the Suppression; Endunn Cables Zhang, Denying Any Intention of the Jiang Faction to Harm Him; Liu Zhi Cables Zhang Xueliang with a Final Admonition <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Xueliang has rebelled in Xi'an, holding the Commander-in-Chief hostage. The National Government has already stripped him of all his concurrent and substantive posts, handing him over to the Military Affairs Commission for strict punishment. Despite repeated advice from various parties, Zhang has shown no remorse. The National Government, therefore, issued a clear order for his suppression on the 16th, specially appointing He Yingqin as the Commander-in-Chief of the Suppression. The resolutions of the National Government are as follows: Zhang Xueliang has betrayed the Party and the country, holding the Commander-in-Chief hostage. He has already been stripped of all his concurrent and substantive posts and handed over to the Military Affairs Commission for strict punishment. Yet, he shows no remorse or intention to surrender himself for punishment. Instead, he has concentrated his troops in Xi'an, resisting orders and attempting to carry out his rebellious schemes, disrupting the overall situation. The people of the whole country are deeply indignant. To rectify discipline and uphold the law, the government has no choice but to issue a clear order for his suppression. The Suppression Commander-in-Chief, He Yingqin, is ordered to swiftly command the national army to eliminate the rebels and pacify the treacherous atmosphere, thereby securing the foundation of the country. This order is hereby issued. He Yingqin is specially appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the Suppression. This order is hereby issued. (Sixteenth Central News Agency dispatch) The traitor Zhang Xueliang instigated a rebellion in Xi'an. The National Government issued a suppression order on the 16th, appointing He Yingqin as the Commander-in-Chief of the Suppression, commanding the national army to eliminate the rebels. All parties unanimously support the central government's actions. Endunn departed from Luoyang by plane at 11:00 AM on the 16th to return to Nanjing. However, due to heavy rain, the plane landed in Bengbu. In the afternoon, he changed to a train to Nanjing and is expected to arrive late at night. (Sixteenth Special Dispatch) The Central Political Committee held its 30th meeting at 9:00 AM on the 16th. The committee members present were Sun Ke, Lin Sen, Wu Jingheng, Feng Yuxiang, Ding Weifen, Ye Chucang, Yu Youren, Kong Xiangxi, Zhu Peide, Dai Chuanxian, Wang Chonghui, Chen Guofu, Chen Lifu, Ju Zheng, Cheng Qian, Chen Bijun, Chen Gongbo, Ma Chaojun, Zhang Ji, He Yingqin, Wang Boqun, Niu Yongjian, Li Wenfan, Liang Hancao, Wang Luyi, and Tan Zhen, totaling 26 members. The members attending as observers were the Minister of Education, Wang Shijie; the Minister of the Navy, Chen Shaokuan; the Minister of Industry, Wu Dingchang; the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Zhang Qun; and the Acting Secretary-General, Chen Bulei, among others. Sun Ke acted as chairman. The resolutions are as follows: 1. Regarding the handling of Zhang Xueliang's rebellion: (1) Appoint Committee Member He Yingqin as the Commander-in-Chief of the Suppression to swiftly command the national army to eliminate the rebels. (2) The National Government shall issue a suppression order immediately. (3) Recommend Committee Member Yu Youren to comfort the military and civilians in the Northwest. 2. The Convention on Slavery is to be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. 3. The term of office of the current members of the Legislative Yuan is approved to be extended until the National Assembly is convened. 4. The provisional measures for the National Science Foundation are to be submitted to the Executive Yuan. 5. The late National Government Committee Member Huang Fu, who assisted the central government and contributed greatly to the country, shall be commended by the National Government and granted a public funeral. (Sixteenth Central News Agency dispatch) (Xi'an) (Dispatch at 2:10 PM) When I met with Zhang Xueliang today, Zhang and his subordinates all assured me that they have no intention of harming Chairman Jiang. Zhang then consulted with his subordinate generals. If no unexpected difficulties arise or if forceful attitudes affect the overall situation, a resolution can be reached within a few days. (Endunn, 15th) (Fifteenth Reuters dispatch) (Local News) Chairman Jiang's British adviser, Endunn, cabled the Associated Press from Luoyang today, stating, "Chairman Jiang and Zhang Xueliang and his subordinates do not want to harm Chairman Jiang. Zhang Xueliang then held a meeting with his subordinates. If no unexpected events occur, the situation is expected to take a sharp turn for the better in a few days." (National News Agency)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Minister of Military Administration Chen Cheng was also trapped in Xi'an with Chairman Jiang. Various newspapers have reported his whereabouts, but many are inaccurate. Zhang Xueliang recently sent a telegram to Mrs. Chen, stating, "Cixiu is residing here very well. Fearing that distant rumors are inaccurate, this telegram is sent to reassure you." This shows that the news circulating outside about his being harmed or missing is all untrue. (Sixteenth Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Kaifeng) Regarding Zhang Xueliang's armed rebellion, Director Liu sent a final admonishing telegram on the 15th, hoping that he would repent and atone to the people of the country. The original telegram stated briefly, "The country is in a critical state. You occupy territory on your own authority, hold the Commander-in-Chief hostage, and force your superiors to assist bandits in attacking. I do not know how you can stand between heaven and earth. If you still recognize the country, then I hope you will repent, escort Chairman Jiang out of Shaanxi with courtesy, and then surrender yourself to await the judgment of the people. Then, this act of bravery may slightly atone for your previous offense. Otherwise, there are clear laws against betraying the country and the Party. Even if we want to accommodate you, the principles of law and discipline are at stake, concerning survival. Who does not have a heart? Who does not have blood? We can only follow the people of the country, knock on the gates and request orders. Once the righteous army arrives, you will have cause to tremble. I truly hope that you will consider the benefits." (Sixteenth Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Chairman of the Bank of China, Song Ziwen, has been urgently summoned by the government to come to Nanjing to discuss the issues arising from the Xi'an Incident. Mr. Song is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Nanjing early tomorrow morning. (Sixteenth Reuters dispatch) (Nanjing) Today, the Central Political Committee decided to issue a suppression order, appointing He Yingqin as the Commander-in-Chief of the Suppression. From this, it can be seen that the central government has abandoned the idea of resolving this incident through negotiations and is determined to resort to force, regardless of the cost. It is said that the government hopes to eliminate the rebels in the shortest possible time. The government has summoned the British adviser, Mr. Endunn, to come to Nanjing and will no longer send him to Xi'an for mediation. Mr. Endunn arrived here today from Luoyang by plane, but due to heavy rain, he was forced to land in Bengbu. The government has instructed him to come to Nanjing by train. (Sixteenth Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The English-language North China Star newspaper published an editorial today, praising the British adviser, Mr. Endunn, for flying to Xi'an to rescue Chairman Jiang, as Xi'an is currently one of the most dangerous places in the world. (Sixteenth Reuters dispatch)</p>

The generals vowed to unite under the leadership of Director Liu to uphold the central government and thoroughly implement national policies both domestically and internationally. (Sixteenth Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Gu Zhutong recently received a telegram from Liu Wenhui on the 15th, stating briefly, "At this time of suppressing bandits, border officials have taken the Commander-in-Chief hostage, in effect supporting the enemy, which is enough to make the world tremble. It is a matter of broken hearts. Wenhui has been entrusted to defend the western border and cares deeply about northern Wei. The mountains are blocking the way, making it difficult to sleep and eat. I only hope to support the central government and quickly devise a plan to rescue Chairman Jiang, which is of utmost importance. Wenhui is responsible for defending the territory and will not have other concerns. But it is obvious that even if we link the hooks and use our strength, we will be in great difficulty. We will obey orders and disregard danger," and so on. (Sixteenth Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) After the Xi'an Incident, the financial situation in Beiping became slightly strained. The highest economic authority in Beiping is working with the financial community to find effective ways to stabilize the situation. According to a financial figure, the financial situation in Beiping was stabilized with maximum effort after the Suiyuan Incident. The detention of Chairman Jiang in Xi'an has dealt another blow to the financial community. However, due to the strong credibility of the government authorities, although securities trading has fallen slightly, it has not affected the stability of the financial situation. However, the greatest hope of the financial community is for Chairman Jiang to regain his freedom. If this happens, the financial situation will improve even further. (Sixteenth Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Company, battalion, and regimental commanders of the National Army and all students of military academies telegraphed calling for the punishment of Zhang. The telegram stated, "To all officers and men of the army, navy, and air force across the country: The traitor Zhang Xueliang has betrayed the country and harmed the people. His various crimes are too numerous to count. The central government has been magnanimous, not pursuing the past, and should have been encouraged to be vigilant, atone for his crimes, and serve the country. Now, he has lost his mind and recognizes the bandit as his father, daring to hold the Commander-in-Chief hostage and make wild claims. What even the rebellious ministers of ancient times dared not do, this traitor has done publicly. His flesh is not even fit for dogs and pigs to eat. Our Chairman is responsible for the important task of reviving the country and the nation, and the safety of the world depends on him. At this time when unification has been achieved and national policies are being promoted, how can we allow this traitor to hold him hostage and make demands, causing failure and plunging the entire nation into an abyss of no return? We, as senior cadres in the National Army, are responsible for rescuing the leader and defending the country. We are willing to go through fire and water and risk our lives. If this traitor can repent and respectfully send the Chairman back to Nanjing, he can be subject to the central government's disposition. If he continues to be unrepentant, we vow to have nothing to do with this traitor or any individual related to him. We are willing to work with our comrades across the country, under the leadership of the Military Affairs Commission and Minister He, to rise up and punish this arch-criminal. This is our humble request. We hope you will consider it. Sincerely, the company, battalion, and regimental commanders of the National Army and all 500 students of the Army Infantry School."

<p>The Day of Nationwide Condemnation is the Day of their Final Doom</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Two hundred and seventy-five national youth generals, including Hu Zongnan, Huang Jie, Li Mo'an, Sun Yuanliang, Li Yannian, Yu Jishi, He Zhonghan, Gui Yongqing, Deng Wenyi, Mao Bangchu, etc., issued a "Public Statement" on the 15th regarding Zhang's rebellious uprising. The original text is recorded as follows: "This time, the rebel Zhang Xueliang suddenly raised troops and caused chaos in Xi'an, colluding with bandits to harm the country, violating the dignity of the leader and stealing the authority of the commander, intending to destroy the already unified nation and stable society, resulting in a rebellious act that is unforgivable and unpardonable. This is the greatest shame for all of us revolutionary soldiers and also the greatest stain in the history of the second revolutionary phase. Zhang believes today that by coercing the leader and stealing the commander, he can do whatever he wants. Little does he know that although the leader's body has lost its freedom, the leader's advocacy and teachings, as well as the leader's will and spirit, have not lost their freedom. For our entire nation, the revolutionary soldiers who have been nurtured and inspired by the leader, the revolutionary comrades of the entire party led by the leader, and the revolutionary compatriots of the entire nation are determined to carry out his advocacy, follow his teachings, abide by his will, and promote his spirit, and we will never coexist with the traitors of the party and the nation in this world. At the same time, we deeply know that Zhang himself uses collusion with bandits to resist the enemy as a pretext for rebellion and treason. However, judging from his complex concepts, dissolute behavior, romantic life, and decadent habits, as well as the long-term influence of these concepts and habits on his subordinates, we know that Zhang himself and his subordinates are not only insufficient to resist the enemy but also insufficient to talk about colluding with bandits. For the concepts, behaviors, and living habits of Zhang himself and his subordinates, although there is no lack of the legacy of bandits, they are not enough to meet the conditions of the Red bandits. We can assert that the day Zhang colludes with the bandits will be the day Zhang is eliminated by the bandits. This kind of result does not need divination. Moreover, today, the revolutionary compatriots of the entire nation, the revolutionary comrades of the entire party, and all of us revolutionary soldiers deeply recognize the difficulties of national unity and the difficulties of the leader's years of hard work and courageous risk-taking to create this national unity and social stability. This recognition is the strongest foundation for the revival of the nation. Although Zhang intends to destroy this situation, we firmly believe that the world will be able to recognize the evil of this destructive behavior from their deep understanding. Therefore, today, not only is the hot blood of all revolutionary soldiers enough to bathe and kill the rebels, maintain national unity, and social stability, but also the tears of grief and pain shed by the revolutionary masses of the whole country over this heinous crime are enough to bathe and kill the rebels, maintain national unity, and social stability. In short, we who have received the leader's long-term cultivation and teachings for more than ten years deeply believe that the leader only knows how to cherish the freedom and life of the party and the nation and has never cared about his own freedom and life. If Zhang still has humanity, he will surely recognize this point and recognize his miscalculation in stealing the commander and coercing the leader to destroy the country and society. He should immediately change his course, release the troops and await punishment, in order to redeem his unforgivable crimes and perhaps win the forgiveness of the nation in one out of ten thousand chances. If he is still obsessed and refuses to correct his mistake, then the day of nationwide condemnation will be the day Zhang automatically determines his final doom. It also does not need divination."

<p>Foreign Press Commentary</p>
<p>(London) The Xi'an Incident was raised in the House of Commons today. Foreign Secretary Eden replied to a question from Sir Archibald Clark Kerr on the report, stating that the Central Government had received telegrams and letters from all parts of China expressing support for the Central Government, and that there was no other news. (Reuters telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the Xi'an Incident in Shaanxi Province, China, The Times recently published a commentary, stating: "Zhang Xueliang's act of betrayal may be beneficial to the Japanese government." The Daily Telegraph reported that "China, which was previously fragmented, is now seeking the soul to which the nation entrusts its destiny. Although this incident is said to be a struggle for leadership, in fact, both sides have reacted seriously to Japan's attempt to invade Chinese territory."</p>
<p>(Paris) Various newspapers have continued to comment on the Xi'an Incident in Shaanxi Province, China. Among them, the Communist Party's organ "L'Humanité" stated: "Zhang Xueliang and his Japanese masters have miscalculated, which is a fact. Zhang Xueliang's actions are beneficial to Japan and harmful to his own country. The Chinese people will surely know this." A radical socialist party's organ "L'Oeuvre" stated: "Zhang Xueliang's act of violence hinders the unification of China and may even promote the disintegration of China. This is what Japan has been seeking. It seems that Zhang Xueliang's actions, ostensibly to protect the Communist Party, are actually driven by Japan. It is also not impossible because if Japan could one day announce to the world that communism is very active within China, it could profit from it." (Havas telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Chinese expatriate community here is extremely concerned about the development of the Xi'an Incident in Shaanxi Province. Chiang Weiguo, the young son of Chiang Kai-shek, is currently studying German at the University of Berlin. Chinese expatriates have expressed their sympathy to him. They have also inquired in London and Paris about the latest news on the development of the incident. As for the Japanese diplomats stationed in Germany, they have remained silent about the Xi'an Incident. German public opinion is also quite chaotic. The newspapers still say that the Xi'an Incident was instigated by the Soviets. (Havas telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Cabinet held a cabinet meeting this morning, during which Foreign Minister Delbos reported to the cabinet members on the development of the Xi'an Incident in Shaanxi Province, China, and presented the latest telegrams sent from the Far East for reading. (Havas telegram, 15th)</p>

<p>— Xu Xu</p>
<p>Perhaps you'd say I was trying to make the girl happy? I was very uncomfortable at the time. I was really confused about the world I lived in. Actually, I, with my traditional upbringing, have always been cautious when speaking to women. Due to my later experiences, I also have some vigilance when greeting men. Whether you ask for directions or inquire about something, you always have to look at the other person's appearance. As for children, you have to be careful, which I had never thought of before. But this lesson gave me much to think about for many days. What kind of heart does a child have? It's just that the environment of Shanghai made her family give her this kind of education, harboring a sense of caution and fear towards all of humanity. But conversely, I have seen that some people who love to play cards, after moving into a new place, within three or four days, become very close to the neighbors, men and women, in front and behind, even more familiar than those who have lived together for more than ten years. What is the reason for this? There is no other reason than that they have something in common. From these common interests, they broke through their superficial hypocrisy.</p>
<p>When two people meet, everyone wants to put on airs and is unwilling to tell anyone anything. Whether it is thoughts, opinions, or desires, they do not reveal any traces. As a result, two people sit opposite each other for one or two hours, day after day, mutually guarding against each other, wondering if the other person will look down on me completely, if they will steal my things, if they will suspect me of being a thief, and not a single conversation takes place. Even if there is one, it is just "The weather today is hahaha." Thus, days pass, and the earth can be circled, but the two people are still far apart, each acting mysterious. I never understand why this is something that civilized human beings should do. Therefore, within the possible range, I want to find ways to break through this hypocrisy. In most cases between two people, I believe that there are common interests. No matter how different the nations are and how different the customs are, there are actually places where we can talk and laugh. Everyone is bored on the train. Why sit rigidly opposite each other? Isn't talking and saying something a more reasonable thing to do?</p>
<p>Therefore, in all my travels, whether it is the soldier sitting opposite me, the old villager, or the merchant, I will always sincerely talk to them for a while. Over the years, I have had many short trips, from which I have gained many interesting experiences. This has cultivated in me a habit of talking based either on what I like or what the other person likes. I have gained a lot of knowledge from there.</p>
<p>On the Jinpu Railway, I helped an old villager carry a piece of luggage, and I talked to him a lot. I learned a lot about farming in the north. I also learned that in his experience, all the foreign students wearing Western clothes looked down on him. Only I, he said, was the first time he had seen a "foreign type" person treat him so well. On the night ferry from Suzhou to Shanghai, because there were many people and little space on the ferry, I couldn't sleep. I talked to a soldier for a long time. He had participated in the Shanghai Battle and told me many things about the Shanghai Battle... I talked with countless other students and businessmen. In these experiences, there is an interesting statistic like this: generally speaking, in terms of age, problems about sex are the easiest to approach for those under 35 years old, while problems about life are easier to approach for those over 40. In terms of class, it is easier to approach laborers by talking about life, and it is easier to approach others by talking about the opposite sex. In terms of region, it is easier to approach villagers by talking about life (this is probably because villagers have feudal minds and think that women can be thought of but not talked about), while it is easier to approach city dwellers by talking about the opposite sex. In terms of occupation, it is easier to approach laborers, business people, and merchants by talking about life, while it is easier to approach students and junior officials by talking about sex. Leaving aside these principles, it is easier to get closer by talking about national affairs, opinions, and thoughts, but this is the least common. It is necessary to wait until after getting close before talking about these opinions and thoughts. In fact, life and sex are the two major desires in life. Confucius once said, "Food and sex are human nature." Russell once believed that humans are either "Marxist" or "Freudian." In my interesting statistics, I also got a little proof. Later, my conversations almost had a formula. I started with the newspaper or the book the other person was reading, probed his thoughts, and if it didn't arouse his interest, I talked about national affairs to life; or I talked about the fields outside the car to the harvest, talking about various things in their hometown. Once, a rural youth sitting opposite me was singing a mountain song facing the window, so I talked to him about women all the way until he got home. People who are not interested in life are sure to like to talk about the opposite sex. Everyone has a different environment, so everyone is different, but from the same aspect, they can also have such similarities. Zhuangzi's saying, "Speaking from their similarities, the world is uniform," is this principle.</p>
<p>On the ship, I also used this formula, and I got close to many Indians and Westerners. An interesting discovery is this: it is easy to arouse the interest of Westerners by talking about sex, while it is easy to arouse the interest of Indians by talking about life. The reason for this is, first, because Westerners who come to the East are not subject to economic pressure, while Indians live under British restrictions every day. The second is that Westerners see these things about both sexes more openly, while Indian society's social interactions are not yet open, so they are not accustomed to talking about sex. But this is not an absolute distinction, but the general situation is like this, which is already enough to make us interested.</p>
<p>Regarding life, almost every Indian youth has a strong sense of national consciousness. They are very eager for freedom and liberation. These Indian youths going to Europe to study are almost entirely studying medicine or engineering, but they have a thorough understanding of the many economic policies used by the British in the colonies. This is something that our Chinese students traveling with us lack. Many of us who study medicine, engineering, and even social sciences only know a little bit of narrow technology within the industry. They know nothing about the overall Chinese society, politics, and economy. Some almost don't even have the most basic common sense of citizenship. I feel that the lack of this kind of citizenship makes it so that even if he has a great research in medicine, engineering, or banking, he will definitely feel that there is no difference between doing his job in China and doing it in Manchukuo. In recent years, many students with specialized skills have become traitors. I think this is an important reason.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Japanese to Promote Gold Mining in the Northeast Starting Next Year <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Driven by increased desire for greater profits in recent years, a five-year plan aims for a total gold production value of 500 million yuan.</p>
<p>Changchun Correspondence: According to Japanese claims, their gold mining operations in Northeast China have shown a great leap forward in the past three years, especially the performance of the Manchurian Gold Mining Company. For example, from June to December in Showa 9 (Republic of China Year 23), the gold production value for half a year was 957,559 yuan. In Showa 10, it was 3,670,848 yuan. This year, from January to [month omitted], it was 8 million yuan. If extrapolated for the entire year, it could reach 10 million yuan, doubling each year. Considering the development and profitability of the gold mining industry, the Japanese are planning to actively promote gold production with a five-year plan starting next year for the Gold Mining Company. They are currently preparing to implement it. Furthermore, they are conducting detailed investigations into enterprises to prevent gold production evasion and private sales. After the implementation of the five-year plan, the estimated gold production value in the Northeast will be between 400 million and 500 million yuan. The outline is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Five-Year Gold Production Plan</p>
<p>Showa 12 (Japan) 15 million yuan</p>
<p>Showa 13 (Japan) 22 million yuan</p>
<p>Showa 14 (Japan) 36 million yuan</p>
<p>Showa 15 (Japan) 57 million yuan</p>
<p>Showa 16 (Japan) 82 million yuan</p>
<p>(2) Gold Mining Implementation Methods</p>
<p>(1) Thorough investigation and rationalization of mining enterprises.</p>
<p>(2) Increase in gold dredging boats (five pairs in Showa 12, with more to be added in the following year).</p>
<p>(3) Improvement and mechanization of gold mining methods.</p>
<p>(4) To promote the aforementioned plan, the following measures will be implemented: (1) Implementation of gold mining immigration; (2) Attraction of domestic Japanese capital; (3) Establishment of technical training schools; (4) Consolidation of small gold workshops; (5) Strengthening of public security police force; (6) Thorough prevention of gold production evasion and secret sales.</p>
<p>Finally, the Japanese optimistically claim that from next year onwards, due to industrial development, the Northeast will prepare a foundation of hard currency against currency inflation. Therefore, there is great hope for gold mining.</p>

<h3 id="e48">National Government Orders to Punish Zhang <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>---Middle</p>
<p>The Xi'an Incident occurred suddenly. The military leader, whom the entire nation looked up to, was unexpectedly kidnapped and lost his freedom. Other important military officers responsible for the suppression were also concentrated under the guise of seeking an audience and were detained by force. At a time when the diplomatic situation is unusually tense and the war on the border is in progress, such an unpredictable storm has arisen in the rear, causing the people a shock that cannot be calmed and increasing the precariousness of the situation. The strength of unity is reverting to disunity. Who caused this? No matter what excuses Zhang Xueliang makes, it will be difficult for him to explain himself to the people.</p>
<p>Regarding this sudden incident, the central government, in addition to grief and indignation, still puts national affairs first and does not want to resort to arms lightly. Therefore, on the one hand, it only maintains the authority of the central government by stripping Zhang of his position and investigating him. On the other hand, it hopes that Chiang Kai-shek will be sent back to Nanjing, hinting at Zhang's self-renewal. In recent days, letters and telegrams from various parties advising Zhang have been widely published in newspapers, but the serious impact of the Shaanxi Incident has not shown any signs of turning around. This means that Zhang Xueliang has no intention of repentance and is determined to disrupt the overall situation. Even if the government has the pain of compromising and seeking perfection, it is difficult to sit idly by and ignore the rebellion. Therefore, yesterday, with the approval of the Central Political Council, the National Government issued an order to punish the rebels, and He Yingqin was appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the punitive expedition. It is expected that in the event of a punitive expedition, it will be difficult to distinguish between the innocent and the guilty. The government takes rectifying discipline as a prerequisite, and it has no choice but to do so. However, Zhang, by creating the fact with his own hands, has caused innocent lives to suffer the same fate, destroyed the situation of unity, destroyed the strength against foreign forces, and turned years of hard work into nothing. The unanimous expectation of the whole country has been reversed. How great is our heartache and disappointment?</p>
<p>In short, now that things have come to this, we no longer want to discuss the merits and demerits. We can only remain calm and united, support the government's policy, and take firm steps. If Zhang's subordinates have a desire to repent, they should repent as soon as possible, so that the punitive expedition can be quickly concluded and the entire strength will not be destroyed. We must not let those close to us grieve and those who hate us rejoice. This is what we earnestly pray for.</p>

<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Committee on Technical Cooperation with China met this morning to discuss the cooperation program for 1937. My representative, Guo Taiqi, said that the Chinese government was very satisfied with the League of Nations' dispatch of experts to China and requested that more assistance be provided by experts in specific and detailed plans for water conservancy and highway projects in the future. League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol replied that he would do his best to assist and suggested establishing a planning office in Nanjing, headed by three engineering experts. The Chinese government also plans to invite Strickland to be a senior rural technical advisor and to add a public administration expert. Strickland has expressed his willingness to take the position of advisor, but an administrative expert has not yet been selected. Regarding the dispatch of Chinese experts to Europe, the Chinese government and the League of Nations have formulated several rules for implementation. However, due to the tight budget next year, only half of the planned number of experts can be sent to Europe. Avenol also intends to tighten up the budget so that more people can be sent. Although the budget for next year is not generous, it is planned to be distributed and used carefully to avoid waste. (Central News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Committee on Technical Cooperation with China held a meeting here this morning.

<p>(London) German Ambassador to the United Kingdom General Ribbentrop, in his first public speech to a British audience at the Grosvenor House tonight, solemnly stated that the resolution of the colonial issue has long been a matter of concern. German leader Hitler is deeply aware that Germany should have colonies to supply the raw materials needed by its country and to restore its world trade, which are two essential measures to improve the current standard of living of the German people. If conflict recurs between Britain and Germany, or creates a world war, it will inevitably lead to a great victory for Bolshevism. Ribbentrop expressed regret that Hitler's repeated proposals to reduce armaments and conclude non-aggression pacts and other peace treaties have all failed. He continued that he believed that if destructive communism continues to gain ground, the world will ultimately be unable to restore order and have peaceful development. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>

Unfortunately, all countries have turned a deaf ear."

Regarding the Spanish issue, the newspaper said that the British and French politicians expressed their hope that the policy of non-intervention would continue, which is in line with the German viewpoint.

For example, Lord Wigram, who recently retired, has been serving in the palace since 1910 and is one of the old ministers of the previous dynasty, has now been appointed as Permanent Lord-in-Waiting and Advisor, which is one example. Wigram served as Secretary to George V and Edward VIII until he resigned in July of this year. Harding, who succeeded Wigram as Secretary to Edward VIII, will continue to serve as Private Secretary to the New Emperor George VI, but due to overwork in this constitutional crisis, he has been granted three months of leave to recuperate.

<h3 id="e64">Dispute Between Turkey and France, League of Nations Council Passes Resolution on Transitional Measures, Sends Personnel to Syria for Inspection, Turkish Representative Unilaterally Abstains from Voting <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Council held a meeting this morning and immediately discussed the issue of the Turkish minority in Alexandretta and Antioch in Syria, and unanimously passed a resolution on transitional measures (i.e., various measures to be taken before the League of Nations Council thoroughly discusses the issue in January next year). However, Turkish representative Rüştü abstained from voting. At the beginning of the meeting today, the reporter, Swedish Foreign Minister Sandler, read out the draft resolution, the content of which was proposed by the French government, and there were three points: (1) Send three inspectors to inspect and report to the League of Nations Council. Once the Council meets in January next year, the task of each inspector will be completed; (2) The French government once sent reinforcements to Antioch to quell the disturbances that occurred earlier and is willing to withdraw them, but the normal number of troops stationed will be maintained; (3) France promises not to submit the treaty signed between France and Syria (i.e., the treaty allowing Syria's independence) to Congress for approval before the meeting in January next year. French representative Weygand then rose and spoke in the name of the French government, saying that the transitional measures proposed by Turkish representative Rüştü, namely sending a neutral police force and establishing an international provisional co-management system, could not be accepted, because these measures endanger the privileges enjoyed by the mandatory power under the current system in Alexandretta and Antioch. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Regarding the issue of the Turkish minority in Alexandretta and Antioch in Syria, the Council of the League of Nations did not have time to hold a meeting this afternoon and postponed it to tomorrow. The reporter on this issue, Swedish Foreign Minister Sandler, had a long conversation with French representative Weygand and Turkish representative Rüştü this afternoon, and they had generally agreed on transitional measures to resolve the issue. The French and Turkish representatives have both agreed to send neutral observers to the cities. The French representative also promised to withdraw the troops sent by France to Antioch when disturbances occurred earlier in the two cities, but the normal number of French troops stationed would still be maintained. In addition, France also allows not to submit the treaty signed between France and Syria (i.e., the treaty allowing Syria's independence) to Congress for approval before the League of Nations Council thoroughly discusses this issue in January next year. However, the French position has a basic point, that is, if the Council of the League of Nations makes any decision at present, it must be limited to strict transitional measures, and these transitional measures must not damage the rights of the mandatory power, because these rights are stipulated in the permanent ruling system of the two cities. Tonight at 10 o'clock, Sandler will continue to hold talks with Weygand and Rüştü to determine several details on which the two sides have not yet agreed. For example, whether Turkish observers can be added to the observers sent to the two cities, in addition to neutral people, must also be determined. It is generally hoped that when the Council holds a meeting at 11:30 tomorrow morning, the French and Turkish sides will be able to reach a complete compromise. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>When the Syrian House of Representatives was re-elected in Arab-Aley, Turkish minorities in Alexandretta and Antioch in that place came out to obstruct it, which led to incidents, with two people killed and twenty people injured. Syrian members of the House of Representatives, regardless of Arab or Turkish nationality, had unanimously expressed regret over this incident. According to news from [omission], the cities are now very calm, but in order to avoid the recurrence of incidents, the authorities have taken various security measures at the border between Alia and Turkey to prevent them.

<p>(Paris) The Senate discussed the mandatory arbitration bill for labor disputes today, and former Minister of Justice Senator Le Mer proposed to postpone the discussion of the bill, saying that the government had previously allowed Senator Bianvenou of the left-wing Radical Democratic Party to find a way to prevent workers from occupying factories, but the facts of destroying property rights are still continuing, so the case should be postponed for discussion. The chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, Duruy, immediately expressed his opposition and said that the national economy is currently in a crisis of collapse, and the Senate has no right to delay the vote on this bill to mediate labor disputes. At this point, Senator Foulquier questioned whether the government has the sincerity to implement various orders regarding preventing the occupation of factories and resolutely try to prevent such incidents. Prime Minister Blum replied that there were a total of 147 incidents of workers occupying factories, of which 115 have been resolved, and the workers have withdrawn from the factories. In addition, 32 cases are in the process of being resolved quickly. Currently, there are no more than 2,400 striking workers in the Paris area. Workers occupying factories in Lille have all withdrawn, and the factories in Mulhouse will soon follow suit. If it is said that labor disputes still exist, then I should ask you to quickly pass the mandatory arbitration bill so that these disputes can be resolved quickly, amicably, and legally. At this point, the Senate rejected Le Mer's motion to postpone the discussion with a majority of 207 votes to 59. Subsequently, the Senate announced the end of the debate and decided to hold another meeting at 10:00 on Thursday morning to discuss the articles of the bill one by one. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>(London) Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons today that the British government has decided to increase the reserves of the Bank of England's note issuing department by £65 million as an expedient measure. This step is tantamount to a sudden expansion of the credit base, which is not currently necessary. Therefore, at the request of the bank, I have exercised the power conferred on the government by the Currency and Bank Notes Act of 1928, ordering a reduction of £60 million in the fiduciary note issue, so that the expansion is limited to a small extent. This measure has no greater cause than being timely and appropriate. The fiduciary issue can be increased or decreased at any time in accordance with the aforementioned act. Business circles are quite puzzled by the Bank of England's purchase of £65 million in cash from the Exchange Equalisation Account while simultaneously reducing the fiduciary note issue by £60 million, leading to divided opinions. However, most people believe that this move can indicate the government's confidence in resisting the pressure on the pound caused by the possible repatriation of funds from France and the potential outflow of cash to Wall Street, using the large amount of cash held in the Exchange Equalisation Account. It is also said that when the pound has a strong upward trend, it is best to restore the free activity of the Exchange Equalisation Account, as the account can curb the depreciation of the pound by selling some of its gold reserves.

<p>(London) After holding talks with French Ambassador Corbin regarding non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War, Britain and France reached complete agreement, which can be confirmed by the outcome of these talks. A practical observation plan for the major non-intervention measures and a mediation plan for the Spanish Civil War are expected to be implemented quickly. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) A subcommittee of the Non-Intervention Committee for the Spanish Civil War previously organized a committee of experts to study how to monitor the transport of military aircraft from various countries to Spain. A plan was drafted, the main point of which was to advocate that international inspection agencies should be stationed at airport in European countries for monitoring. Germany and Portugal have expressed their rejection of this plan. Therefore, the expert committee has already begun to devise other alternative plans. A German expert on the committee left for his country tonight to seek instructions from his government. It is generally hoped that the expert can bring back a compromise plan to London so that the aerial observation plan can be drafted as soon as possible. Naval and army experts from various countries attending the Adjustment Committee are now scheduled to meet at the Foreign Office tomorrow to discuss the observation plan for the Spanish border and ports. As for the ban on volunteers going to Spain to serve, so far only the French government has expressed its acceptance, and it is hoped that other relevant countries will also follow suit.

<p>Lisbon. The Portuguese government submitted its reply yesterday to the British and French governments' proposal for mediating the Spanish Civil War and holding a plebiscite for the Spanish people, refusing to accept it. The reply stated that Portugal would consider any proposals that would safeguard peace in Spain, but it would not be appropriate to ignore its own interests. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>Lisbon. Portugal's reply to the British and French proposals for mediating the Spanish Civil War was released by the Portuguese authorities today. The document expressed doubt about the feasibility of mediation and declared that this was a struggle between civilization and barbarism. Unless one side gains complete victory and establishes a strong and generous government, mediation would only be a temporary truce, and a more severe war would follow. If both sides in Spain freely agree to mediation, then the Portuguese government is prepared to cooperate with other countries to study how to make the mediation effective. (Reuters, 16th)</p>

<p>(Moscow) Discussing the news of the upcoming conclusion of the Japan-Poland "Cultural Agreement," the Izvestia newspaper said, "After the signing of the Polish-German agreement, which has nothing to do with human republic and cultural exchange, what followed was the so-called necessity of Japanese-Polish cultural coordination. This fact is deeply meaningful. "This Polish-Japanese agreement, which is about to be concluded, is completely the same as the Japanese-German agreement. Foreign Minister Arita has long known from past experience that the anti-Communist International slogan he chose to advance the Japanese-German conspiracy of peace is ineffective and cannot conceal his true intentions. So he created the signboard of "cultural coordination" to bring Poland into the conspiracy. Not long ago, Mr. Beck put forward a draft proposal in the League of Nations that was clearly manufactured by Germany. Yesterday, Japan announced the proposed Polish-Japanese agreement, the significance of which proves Poland's participation in the Japanese-German aggression conspiracy." (TASS, 15th)</p>

<p>Exchange Rates</p>
<p>British-American. The London foreign exchange market was quiet this morning, and the price of the pound was slightly firm. The opening exchange rate for British-American was $4.90879, higher than the closing price of American-British yesterday by 15625. A small period later, it continued to rise by 1875 to $4.910625. At 1 PM in the afternoon, it fell back by .0625 to $4.91.</p>
<p>British-French. The French exchange rate opened up by 1 pound sterling to 105.13. This price did not move this morning.</p>
<p>Securities</p>
<p>New York. The stock market was still stable this morning. After the market price rose, profiteers took the opportunity to close out their positions, and selling pressure was common. Besselheim Steel stock plummeted, and metal, automobile, and steel stocks were under heavy pressure, while public utilities and railroad stocks were still good. The ups and downs were mostly narrow, and the trading was somewhat selective. The stock market prices in New York are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Cotton and Wheat</p>

The trend of miscellaneous grains is the same as that of the wheat market.</p>
<p>New York cotton market. Stable opening, March futures opened and rose by 5 pounds sterling to 12.37 due to purchases by peers and short covering. As a result, the market gradually became uneven, and the market price fell back to 12.34 due to closing out positions and some straddle sales, but it was still 2 pounds sterling higher than the opening.</p>

<p>London. The rubber market was firm today. At 1 PM in the afternoon, January-March futures rose by .15 to 9 pence .625.</p>
<p>New York. The buying pressure in the rubber market yesterday was seen again today. Consumption figures are currently increasing significantly, resulting in repeated price increases in recent times. It seems unlikely that there will be a reactive impact on production in the short term that will affect the market price, so merchants are very interested. Near noon, profit-taking was stimulated by high prices, causing the price to fall slightly. March futures reached 20.20, which was 29 pounds sterling higher than yesterday's closing price.

<h3 id="e85">Baotou in Suiyuan Province is Resisting the Enemy; Japanese Special Agents Have Withdrawn; Radio Station Has Also Been Canceled; Market Prosperity is Gradually Returning to Its Former State <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Suiyuan Correspondence. The reporter went to Baotou on the afternoon of yesterday and arrived at 4 o'clock. He immediately took a car to visit the airport and the Nanhai Zi area of the Yellow River Wharf, which is 20 miles south of the city. In the evening, he visited Tian Shumei, the city defense commander, the deputy chairman of the Sui-Mongolian Political Council and deputy leader of the Yi League, and A Wang, the commander of the Bao-Xi Railway Protection, as well as the county magistrate and director of the public security bureau, and talked briefly before returning to Suiyuan the next morning. The sights and sounds will be haphazardly recorded below.</p>
<p>Baotou City Appearance</p>
<p>Baotou is an important road north to the various leagues and banners of Inner Mongolia and west to Ningxia and Gansu, and it is also a water and land wharf where fur, grain, licorice, etc. are concentrated. It is the only major town in western Suiyuan. Commerce is prosperous, surpassing Suiyuan. The population is smaller in summer and autumn, about 70,000 people, which is 10,000 fewer than Suiyuan (because some citizens go to various villages to plant agricultural products). In spring and winter, about 90,000 people, which is 10,000 more than Suiyuan (because farmers move to the city after the autumn harvest and merchants from various places come to buy fur). This year, 7 to 8 million catties of fur were sold. The local value is 5 jiao per catty, and it can be sold for 6 jiao when transported to Tianjin. Sheepskin is in short supply. The sales volume and value are more than twice as high as in previous years. Because this winter happens to be the time of the war on the Sui border, the number of National Army troops increased by about 50,000. Each person needs a leather coat, which requires 3 sheets of leather, totaling 150,000 sheets. At the same time, pseudo-bandits and certain parties also bought a large amount of leather, resulting in an imbalance between supply and demand. The licorice produced in Ningxia and Inner Mongolia is transported to Baotou every year in a quantity of more than 3 million catties, and is wholesaled to merchants in various places. This year, fur merchants have made huge profits and are beaming with joy.</p>
<p>Japanese Activities</p>
<p>In Baotou, there are several Japanese people, including Nakagawaroji Hideo, Kaneya, Kuroki Shokou, and Oono Takiji from the branch office established by Hayama, renting a small courtyard in the Baotou Hotel, with a dozen rooms. A radio station is set up inside, reporting news to Changchun, Rehe, Tianjin, etc. every day. To the right of our aircraft factory, there are two aircraft rooms built by the Japanese, which have now been recovered by us through negotiations. However, Japanese aircraft still fly in from time to time, and there are fixed flights every Tuesday. It is said that when the Japanese were repairing the airfield, there were five or sixty Japanese people in Baotou every day. After serious negotiations with our side, the number gradually decreased. The Japanese previously sent special agents to the Wangfu of various banners in the Wuyi leagues, and also set up radio stations. Radio stations were also set up in Wuyuan and Gongmiaozhe, reporting news to the Japanese side at any time. Since Bailingmiao was recovered by our army, the Japanese special agents in various places have withdrawn one after another, and the radio stations have also been canceled invisibly. The importance of the recovery of Bailingmiao can be seen here. A Japanese steamship in the form of an airplane is parked on the bank of the Yellow River. It is said that it has been there for seven or eight months. Recently, the Japanese side sent 50 to 60 surveying personnel and wireless personnel to measure everywhere along the bank of the Yellow River, and also went to Wuyuan, Linhe, and other places to measure. After our side discovered this, we sent military police to monitor the ship, but we still could not dissuade them from their illegal work. Now, because the Yellow River is frozen, their work has to be stopped.</p>
<p>A Wang's Talk</p>
<p>A Wang was recently appointed by the Central Government as the commander of the first bandit suppression area on the Mongolian border, and Pan Shi as the commander of the second bandit suppression area. The reporter visited A Wang at the Baoxi Railway Protection Army Headquarters and was received. According to him, the Yi League is now very peaceful. The total population of the seven banners under its jurisdiction is less than 200,000 people, including 18,000 people in Hangjin Banner, plus 5,000 Han Chinese, more than 20,000 people in Jungar Banner, and more than 10,000 people in each of the other banners. The seven banners have a total of more than 3,000 security teams, including more than 1,300 people in Hangjin Banner, 1,500 people in Jungar Banner, and 200 people in Zhasak Banner. These security teams are not a problem for the security of the various banners.</p>
<p>Tian Shumei's Talk</p>
<p>The reporter visited Tian Shumei, the city defense commander, that evening. According to him, Baotou is now responsible for maintaining security by this brigade. In recent years, residents have been able to live and work in peace and contentment, and commerce has gradually prospered as a result. Therefore, merchants who were afraid of the bandits and dared not move forward have now resumed their old outlook. Baotou's defenses are solid, and there is no need to worry about security.</p>
<p>On the train, I saw many flocks of sheep, camels, and donkeys along the way. I asked the local people traveling with me, "I have often heard that there are many herds of horses and sheep in Inner Mongolia, but why are there donkeys everywhere now?" According to the answer, there were many bandits in Inner Mongolia in the past. Every autumn and winter, many herds of horses were plundered by bandits, and the residents suffered from it. Therefore, they changed to raising herds of donkeys. This is something that happened after the Republic of China. (12th)</p>
<h3 id="e86">Guangzhou Garrison Headquarters: Meeting Convened Regarding the Shaanxi Incident; Military and Political Leaders Jointly Telegraph Support for the Central Government; Banking Sector Also Discusses Measures to Stabilize Finance <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: News of the Xi'an Incident reached Guangdong on the evening of the 12th. By 12 o'clock that night, the Guangzhou Garrison Headquarters of the Military Affairs Commission, the Headquarters of the Fourth Route Army, and the Provincial Government had all received secret telegrams. Later, the Guangzhou branch of the Central News Agency produced and distributed a general press release. However, the release did not reach the newspapers until about 5 a.m. on the 13th. Apart from one or two newspapers that managed to publish it in time, those that did not were quick to issue special editions that day. As a result, the news spread widely, and people throughout the city were shocked. The following is a brief account of the situation in Guangdong Province over the past few days:</p>
<p>Military and Political Stance</p>
<p>In Guangdong Province, the most important military organization in name is the Guangzhou Garrison Headquarters of the Military Affairs Commission. Since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek went north, many important military officers had left Guangzhou with him. Initially, He Yingqin was internally designated as the Director of the Guangzhou Garrison Headquarters. However, due to pressing military affairs in the north, he was unable to come to Guangdong. Later, Army Commander Chen Cheng temporarily took over, but before long, Chen was also ordered to go north. Lin Weiwen, a staff officer of the Garrison Headquarters, recently returned to Nanjing due to important matters in the capital. After the Hankou Garrison Headquarters was established, the Guangzhou Garrison Headquarters transferred over thirty staff members to Hankou. Currently, the Guangzhou Garrison Headquarters retains the First and Second Departments, with Luo Zhuoying, the Army Commander of the 18th Army, acting as the Director, and Qian Zhuolun as the Director of the First Department, and Liu Jianqun as the Director of the Second Department. On the evening of the 12th, after the Garrison Headquarters suddenly received news that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek had been detained in Xi'an, Qian and Liu immediately visited Luo Zhuoying to discuss important military and political matters in Guangdong Province and consulted with Yu Hanmou, the Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Route Army, to discuss countermeasures. As a result, on the one hand, Yu Hanmou was asked to telegraph his position, and on the other hand, he was instructed to maintain public order. Yu Hanmou issued a telegram on the 13th expressing his support for the Central Government. At noon on the 13th, the Guangzhou Garrison Headquarters convened a meeting of military officers at the Garrison Headquarters office on Da Ma Road. Those present included Luo Zhuoying, Yu Hanmou, Huang Musong, Xu Jingtang, Liu Jianqun, Li Jiang, Li Jiezhi, and others. The main points of the resolutions were as follows: (1) All military and political officials should telegraph their support for the Central Government; (2) Military and political officials should maintain calm and strictly guard against the activities of reactionary elements; (3) Maintain financial stability and investigate and apprehend bandits disrupting finance; (4) The General Headquarters of the Fourth Route Army and the Provincial Government should order all division and brigade commanders, security commanders of all districts, and administrative commissioners of all districts to strengthen local defense. At 8 a.m. on the same morning, the General Headquarters of the Fourth Route Army also convened a meeting of its officers. Those present included Commander-in-Chief Yu Hanmou, Chief of Staff Chen Mianwu, Adjutant-General Pan Yingkun, Chief of Military Affairs Wu Fan, Chief of Military Supply Ma Binghong, Chief of Ordnance Huang Yuan, Commander of the Military Police Li Jiang, Police Chief Li Jiezhi, and Division Commanders Zhang Ruigui and Mo Xide, totaling more than twenty people. They discussed the current situation for over two hours and resolved on a number of important matters, including maintaining public security and strengthening the defense of Guangdong Province. At 9 a.m. on the 14th, the generals of the Fourth Route Army and the 18th Army held a joint meeting. All military officers above the rank of major general participated, including Yu Hanmou, Luo Zhuoying, Xiang Hanping, and Xu Jingtang. The meeting adjourned at about 11 a.m.</p>
<p>Financial Dynamics</p>
<p>After the news of the Xi'an Incident spread, some merchants took the opportunity to manipulate finance. On the morning of the 13th, the exchange rate suddenly rose. Usually, the premium on Hong Kong dollars was around 52 (meaning that 100 Hong Kong dollars was worth 152 Guangdong dollars). On the afternoon of the 13th, it rose to 62. The prices of various public bonds all plummeted. Guangxi paper money had dropped to 60% of the value of Guangdong dollars (usually 80%). Finance Director Song Ziliang convened a meeting of leaders from the banking sector, the branch of the Central Bank, the branch of the Bank of China, the branch of the Bank of Communications, and the presidents of provincial and municipal banks at the Finance Department at 3 p.m. that afternoon. He announced that the provincial bank had ample reserves. Since August, the bank had issued 24,108,000 yuan in provincial silver notes, backed by 12,462,000 yuan worth of silver as cash reserve, and another 12,000,000 yuan in public bonds issued by the Ministry of Finance as guarantee reserve. Therefore, its credit was solid. Recently, due to the purchase of silver, an additional 16,500,000 yuan in provincial silver notes and 400,000 yuan in provincial silver dollars have been issued, all backed by 100% central legal tender and raw silver and gold as reserves. This shows that its financial strength is substantial. As a director of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, he will guide the branches of these banks to assist the provincial bank. Therefore, the financial situation is as stable as a rock. Because the end of the year is approaching, the provincial bank will provide loans for the New Year to allow businesses and industries to borrow funds and facilitate turnover. By the 14th, the exchange rate had slightly decreased, with Hong Kong dollars falling to 56. However, trading remained suspended. On the afternoon of the 14th, the banking sector reconvened a meeting to discuss measures to stabilize finance. The meeting was convened by the Guangzhou Banking Association. Representatives from banks such as the Guohua Bank, the East Asia Bank, the Guangdong Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Shanghai Bank, the Guohuo Bank, the Jincheng Bank, the Yanyeh Bank, and the Silk Industry Bank attended. As a result, they unanimously agreed to assist in stabilizing Guangdong silver notes and determining the ratio between the national currency and silver notes. The buying price should not exceed 5, and the selling price should not exceed 51, to stabilize finance and prices in the province. Also, on the 14th, the authorities sent personnel to secretly investigate financial manipulation. Therefore, the buying and selling of Hong Kong dollars and silver remained suspended on the 14th. As for market prices, there were no major changes, only the price of copper coins was slightly higher. Usually, 20 copper coins could be exchanged for 1 jiao, but recently only 18 could be exchanged.</p>
<p>Peaceful Public Security</p>
<p>In recent days, many rumors have circulated in the city. To maintain social order, the authorities have ordered Li Jiang, the Commander of the Military Police District, and Li Jiezhi, the Chief of Police, to dispatch military police and police to patrol day and night. After 12 o'clock at night, suspicious pedestrians are questioned. The police also pay attention to the movement of household registrations in the city and send detectives to hotels, inns, and restaurants to investigate. They also review the population of boat households to prevent criminals from hiding. The military police department has dispatched military police bicycle patrol teams, with five people in each team, totaling more than 120 teams, distributed throughout the urban area, taking turns patrolling. Outside the city, there are security teams to assist in defense. As for the Yuehan Railway, all armies under the jurisdiction of the Yue Railway Garrison Headquarters are stationed at strategic locations. Therefore, public security in the provincial capital is currently peaceful, and market trade is as usual. (December 15)</p>
<h3 id="e87">After the Occurrence of the Shaanxi Incident: Xiamen Remains Peaceful; Business and Academic Circles Telegraph Request for Punishment; Public Security Bureau Issues Notice to Reassure the People <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Communication: After news of the Xi'an Incident reached Xiamen, the whole city was greatly shaken. Although that day was a Sunday and various circles were on holiday, individuals were running around spreading the news. Whenever people met, they invariably discussed the matter with great tension. This spread to the lower classes of people on the streets. The morning newspapers were sold out. However, the market remained extremely stable. On Monday the 14th, various agencies and organizations held meetings to discuss the matter. In the evening, the Xiamen Chamber of Commerce, various trade associations, the Municipal Education Association, and various schools jointly telegraphed the National Government, requesting that Zhang Xueliang be punished. Because Xiamen is in a special location and has been deeply stimulated by foreign aggression, the support for the suppression of bandits this time is unprecedentedly enthusiastic. However, rice merchants are taking the opportunity to manipulate prices. The price of rice, which had been trending down, rose slightly by one or two jiao on the 14th and 15th. The diplomatic community remains silent. The Quanzhou Xinbao, a Japanese agency, published an inaccurate special edition on the 15th concerning Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. The Public Security Bureau immediately ordered the police to arrest the newsboys along the street and confiscate the newspapers. The Gulangyu Municipal Council took the same action. The Municipal Government also lodged a protest with the Japanese Consul, who warned the newspaper in advance. (December 16)</p>
<h3 id="e88">Wuhu Authorities: Alert to Local Security, Stabilizing Prices; Special Commissioner's Office Announces Informal Martial Law <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Wuhu Communication: Upon learning of the major change in Xi'an, officials and civilians here were shocked. The price of newspapers from both local and outside cities suddenly increased sharply. Even with maximized printing quantities, supply could not meet demand. The people's concern for national affairs is now vastly different from the past. Thousands of teachers and students from eight middle schools, including Wuhu Middle School and Advanced Agricultural School, gathered at the Wuhu Middle School playground at 3 p.m. on the 14th amidst the bitter wind. First, they stood solemnly for three hours, quietly listening to Huang Anlu, the director of the political training department of the stationed army, and Gao Wenbo, the special commissioner of the Second Administrative District and concurrently the Magistrate of Wuhu County, report on the current situation. Afterwards, they resolved to pass two telegrams in the name of the United Middle Schools, unanimously condemning Zhang Xueliang, urging him to uphold righteousness and escort Chairman Chiang safely back to the capital, and unanimously supporting the Central Government nationwide, using the power of public opinion to urge Zhang to repent. The Wuhu All-Circles Suppression of Bandits, Elimination of Traitors, Resistance to Insults, and National Salvation Conference, which was recently organized, as well as similar organizations in various counties in southern Anhui, also sent telegrams to the Central Government, sincerely supporting Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's return to the capital to preside over the overall situation. The Administrative Commissioner's Office, in view of the people's tense emotions, although superficially calm as usual, feared that villains would take the opportunity to spread rumors, inevitably affecting people's hearts. Moreover, Wuhu is a city where Chinese and foreigners live together, close to the capital. In order to consolidate local security and people's livelihood, it implemented informal martial law on the 15th. After 11 p.m. every night, pedestrians will be inspected. Villains who fabricate rumors will be carefully investigated and apprehended. On the one hand, the industrial and commercial circles were strictly ordered to maintain the normal state of various commodity prices and not to take the opportunity to raise prices and disrupt the market. Also, at 9 a.m. on the morning of the 15th, more than 1,000 representatives from all walks of life in Wuhu were convened at the Xinhua Grand Theater on Zhongshan Road. Commissioner Gao presided over the meeting, announcing the government's handling of the Shaanxi Incident and instructing the people at all levels to maintain their usual attitude of living and working in peace. Subsequently, it was decided that the conference would send telegrams to the Central Government and Zhang Xueliang. The meeting adjourned at noon. (December 15)</p>

<p>Opening Up the County's Main Road</p>
<p>The streets in the urban area of this county are traditionally very narrow, making transportation inconvenient. Now that the Xihu Railway has opened to traffic, there is a great need to widen the county's main road. The county government is planning to widen the first main line from the South Gate to the North Gate to eight meters to facilitate traffic. This has been approved by the Construction Department. However, according to the opinions of the stationed army, it must be widened to twelve meters to facilitate transportation. It is also proposed to change the route, starting from the South Gate, passing through South Gate Street, South County Street, Daonan Street, County Back Street, North City Center, West Lane, and reaching North Gate Street, close to the northern suburbs, and then widening the northern suburbs to reach the port and connect with the Yangfu Highway, so that it can be bypassed. After consultation, in order to reduce losses, it has been uniformly changed to widening ten meters, and it is scheduled to start work within a few days and be completed within two months. However, the archway of the city gate does not meet the original budget and must be planned separately, delaying the start of construction. After the first line is completed, it will start from the West Gate and open up through Siqian Street, etc., to connect the lines so that it can be looped.</p>

<p>Joint Defense Office Executes Traitors</p>
<p>The Joint Defense Office of Taihu Lake Water Police of Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces, in the last month, arrested the traitor Zhenjiang Xiao Shizi, namely Li Asi, and the bandit Qin Er in this county. After interrogation, they confessed to plotting wrongdoing and robbing with weapons without denying it. A special request was submitted to the Military Affairs Commission for approval to execute them by shooting. After Director Chen received the order, he identified the two criminals, bound them, and took them to the Mudun outside the East Gate for execution by shooting as a warning to the public.</p>
<p>Establishment of a Tramp Training Institute</p>
<p>The tramp training institute in this county, since Magistrate Xu appointed Wu Xuexin to prepare, has been nearly two months, and preparations have been completed. The opening ceremony is scheduled for the 16th. The institute first has a printing department, a coal base department, and a labor service department. In the future, when funds are sufficient, it will be necessary to increase parts to meet social needs.</p>

<p>Judges of the Court Switch Positions</p>
<p>Ren Guanghai, the prosecutor of the local court of this county, has recently received an order from the Judicial Administration Department to go to the Nanjing Judge Training Institute to receive training. After Ren Jun received the order, he set off to Beijing yesterday to receive training. When the term expires, he will return to this county to serve. Also, Liu Bingzhen, a judge of the Criminal Court, was ordered to switch positions with Sheng Shengxiu, a judge of the Nantong Court. Judge Sheng has completed his training and came to Wuxi yesterday to take over and hear cases.</p>
<p>Organizing Labor Service</p>
<p>The labor service for the twenty-fifth year in this county has long been ordered by the county government to the districts for investigation and reporting. However, this service is not limited to dredging rivers, such as repairing dikes, attacking ponds, building roads, and afforestation, as well as self-defense Dingcheng, etc., all of which can be used to organize. The project does not dislike being small or large, and the promotion strives to be universal. Yesterday, Magistrate Long again ordered the district chiefs to formulate separate rules based on local conditions and report them within the year for verification and handling.</p>

<p>Joint Defense by Military Police in Tong Area</p>
<p>In order to prevent traitors from causing disturbances in the counties of Tong, the water and land police teams have specially resolved to divide the responsible defense areas. In addition, the mountain military police joint inspection office sent a team to take charge of patrolling. In the hinterland areas, the township protection system is implemented by the township and town Baos, and the strongmen patrol system is strictly enforced. The Special Commissioner's Office specially ordered the county magistrates to go to the villages to inspect and urge implementation.</p>
<p>County Government Strictly Pursues Overdue Taxes</p>
<p>The accumulated overdue annual taxes in Tongyi over the years amount to more than one million yuan. The county government specially joined local agencies to form a committee to pursue overdue taxes. Since the business owners have already collected rent, the pressure is on to squeeze and pursue. The number of receipts has been very high in recent days, and 400,000 yuan has been collected.</p>

<p>Rising Grain Prices Affect Commerce</p>
<p>Since this autumn harvest in Taixian, grain market prices have been rising steadily. In the past few days, the rising trend has been strong. The price of wheat has risen by more than ten yuan, which is unprecedented in recent years. According to the recent Jiangxun market price, pointed rice is 4 yuan and 2 jiao, bald rice is 4 yuan, Zhan rice is 4 yuan and 7 jiao, pointed rice is 10 yuan, bald rice is 9 yuan and 5 jiao, tea rice is 10 yuan and 4 jiao, barley is 4 yuan and 8 jiao 5, wheat is 10 yuan and 8 jiao, new yuan wheat is 6 yuan and 5 jiao. In addition, soybeans, sesame, buckwheat, black beans, etc. have all risen more or less than before. Taixian has always been a food gathering and distribution market for counties in Jiangbei and the lower reaches of the river. Every year, the county's commerce relies on the turnover of trade after the autumn. Recently, due to the rising grain prices, foreign merchants are no longer buying poorly, and many rice customers are turning to Nantong Erjiagang and other places. The land trade in Chen and Jiangquhai districts has been extremely bleak, and general commerce has also declined and languished.</p>

<p>Busy Cargo Transportation on the Southern Section of the Jinpu Railway</p>
<p>Due to the busy transportation on the Jinpu Railway recently, there are not enough freight vehicles to allocate, and cargo transportation in various places has been greatly affected. In the southern section between Xu and Pei, there is a particular lack of freight vehicles. As a result, the goods waiting to be transported at various stations are piled up like mountains, with food accounting for the majority. The recent invisible stagnation of the grain market here and the reduction in the transportation of miscellaneous grains are due to this impact. In addition, there is also a lack of coal transportation vehicles, and the number of coal transports has been greatly reduced. The coal from Huainan Datong has also been difficult to transport due to the shallow water of the Huai River, causing the price of coal to look up. The price of firewood and coal in Lieshan has risen by 1 jiao per bushel. Most grain merchants believe that it is difficult to transport by Jinpu Road, so they entrust the goods to the Huaihe Wheel Industry Cooperative to transport them to Tian, and then transfer them to Huainan, Jiangnan, Jinghu, and Shanghai to transport them to Shanghai. In recent days, the goods transported out have been mainly miscellaneous grains such as soybeans and sesame. The Joint Transport Office of the Huaihe Railway Huaihe Joint Transport in Bengbu is responsible for handling the joint transport matters. The Bengbu Chamber of Commerce has telegraphed the Railway Bureau, requesting that vehicles be allocated to dredge the bond transportation within the possible range to help businesses in difficulty.</p>

<p>Mayor Wu received a telegram from Vice President Kong in Nanjing on the 15th, which read: "Shanghai Mayor Tiecheng Brother Xun Jian, Fenmi, Recently received a phone report from Donner in Xi'an, arrived in Shaanxi yesterday, and met with the Chairman, who is very safe, and the rest are well. Knowing Note. Brother Kong Xiangxi Kouchou, Xianmi, Jingyin."</p>
<p>A Central News Agency reporter saw in a foreign newspaper that there was news that Chairman Chiang had been killed in Xi'an, but did not know the truth. Therefore, he drove to the downtown area to visit Mayor Wu. According to Mayor Wu, the foreign newspaper's record was not deliberately fabricated by the newspaper, but reprinted the news broadcast by the Red Army, which disturbed people's hearts. Yesterday, Nanjing received a telegram from Xi'an Donner consultant, saying that he had personally met with Chairman Chiang. Today, Reuters has received the same message from Donner to the society. This proves that Chairman Chiang's life is safe, and no matter how unscrupulous Zhang Xueliang is, I am sure that he would not dare to harm Chairman Chiang."</p>
<p>Jiang Fangzhen, who had just returned from overseas military inspection, went to Shaanxi to visit Chairman Chiang. He happened to encounter the Xi'an Incident, and Jiang was also imprisoned in Xi'an. Shanghai has recently received Jiang's telegram reporting safety. This telegram was sent from Xi'an at 8 p.m. on the 15th and arrived in Shanghai at 8 a.m. on the 16th. The original telegram reads, "Shanghai Yabuer Electric Factory Manager Hu Xiyuan, Zhuang Shenwen, Jian, Ping An, please inform, Fangzhen."</p>

The original telegram is as follows: Urgent, Xian Zhang Hanqing Mr. Xun Jian, The Yuan Telegram will be delivered, Now that the meaning is still unfinished, I would like to speak to the executive again, Reading the executive's telegram a few days ago, the reason why the executive seized Chairman Chiang, is nothing more than a request to reorganize the government, accommodate the Communist Party, and unite with Russia, Try to think about the current national government, It is not only loved by the entire Chinese nation, It is also entrusted to the entire national policy of resisting insults and seeking survival in China, This determined that the Suiyuan warning, the Central Army participated in the battle, fighting bravely to kill the enemy and resist insults, and the great righteousness is obvious, In the future, it will advance to recover the lost land and shine our China, It is only a matter of time, However, the executive branch, at this critical moment, Mistakenly advocating the reorganization of the government, It is no different from cutting off its head, Its violation of public opinion, Laughing at foreigners, Even a three-foot child knows it, The executive branch is greedy for profit, How dizzy is it, And the executive branch previously stationed in the Northeast, Re-accepting the frontier, The 918 battle, withdrawing troops and abandoning the land, handing over the enemy with both hands, Now, as the most corrupt person in the country, he extravagantly speaks of resisting Japan and resisting insults, recovering lost land, Sima Zhao's heart, everyone knows it, Deceiving oneself and others, who can believe it, If the Communist Party still knows public opinion, If the Soviet Union still has reason, I will never be willing to form an alliance with the executive branch, Try to read the statement of the Soviet TASS, the executive branch should be ashamed and awakened, If the Communist Party does not care about public opinion and specializes in means, It has already concluded an alliance with the executive branch, Recognizing the executive branch as a comrade, However, the executive branch must know that this is only a temporary strategy of the Communist Party, In order to achieve its goals, the Communist Party does not choose any means, If the executive branch is fortunate for a while, There will also be a day when it is cleared out, Then it is for the executive branch's personal plan, And not for the country and the nation, The executive branch should also know that uniting with Russia is like climbing a tree to catch fish, And accommodating the Communist Party is like eating arsenic and fighting tigers, When this telegram was about to be sent, I received a translation of the TASS Moscow Pravda editorial, Said that the executive branch's rebellion was instigated by a certain country, Then the executive branch is a beastly thief, Not only is there no face to see people, How can he face his father in the ground, The executive branch should think it over, A difference of opinion, life and death are immediately decided, The executive branch should know that Chairman Chiang has always been magnanimous, For political enemies, I have never thought of adding evil, Do not count old accounts, The executive branch now repents, Immediately restore the Chairman's freedom, Then the people of the whole country are still willing to guarantee the executive's wealth, Otherwise, everyone will want to sleep on the executive's skin and eat the executive's flesh, Although the world is big, where can the executive branch live, The executive branch should think it over, Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters of the Chinese Kuomintang, Xian,</p>

<p>The Continental News reports that Mr. Powell, a Far East cameraman for the American Fox Film Corporation, departed from Shanghai for Beiping this morning (the 16th). If possible, he will go to Xi'an to film the major events in China. His assistant, Mr. Vargassoff, who is currently in Beiping, will also accompany him. Mr. Vargassoff is also currently serving as Zhang Xueliang's personal photographer. According to Mr. Powell last night, although he is also a friend of Mr. Zhang, the resistance to going to Xi'an is quite strong, and he fears he may not be able to achieve his objective. It was also reported yesterday that Mr. Huang, a news photographer for the American Hearst Metrotone News, has already gone to Xi'an from Qingdao. Mr. King, a reporter for the New York Times News Agency, is also reportedly departing from Beiping, intending to reach Xi'an.

It is noted that the publisher of the Chicago Daily News is Mr. Knox, the Republican vice-presidential candidate who lost in the recent US presidential election.</p>
<p>The Continental News reports that Mr. Lutz, the pilot of the Eurasia Aviation Corporation, and Mr. Fischer, the co-pilot, were initially of concern for their safety.

Unless the situation in Xi'an improves significantly, it will not stop in that city as usual for the time being. According to Eurasia Aviation Corporation officials, the rapid restoration of order in Xi'an is crucial from the standpoint of China's commercial aviation. Thousands of people directly or indirectly rely on Eurasia's aircraft. Xi'an has become a hub for Northwest aviation operated by the Sino-German company and a very important aviation station.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Contract for Chengdu-Chongqing Railway Loan Signed Yesterday: Total of 34.5 Million, Loan Provided by French Banking Group, Signed by Representative of China Construction Bank <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway Company, for the purpose of constructing the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, signed a contract for a loan of 34.5 million yuan with the French banking group, represented by the China Construction Bank and the Banque Franco-Chinoise. Song Ziwen, Executive Director of the China Construction Bank, issued the following statement regarding the loan:</p>
<p>Today, the China Construction Bank, representing the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway Company, signed a loan contract with the Banque Franco-Chinoise, representing the French banking group, for the construction of the railway between Chengdu and Chongqing. The railway is 523 kilometers long and passes through a prosperous area in central Sichuan. It is expected to be completed within two and a half years. The construction cost is estimated at 54.5 million yuan, of which 20 million yuan will be borne by the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway Company, and 34.5 million yuan will be borrowed from the French banking group. Of this amount, 27.5 million yuan is for the cost of materials and freight to Chongqing, and the remaining 7 million yuan is for cash. The loan will be repaid in 15 years and is unconditionally guaranteed by the Ministry of Railways. The Sichuan-Guizhou Railway Company received a business license from the Executive Yuan on March 21 of this year and was formally established today. Its capital is 20 million yuan, of which 11 million yuan is commercial stock underwritten by the China Construction Bank, 4.5 million yuan is allocated by the Ministry of Railways, and the remaining 4.5 million yuan is allocated by the Sichuan Provincial Government. This loan for the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is very different from previous railway loans: (1) The railway is a private railway, and its business management is entirely in accordance with commercial companies. If necessary, the government will still provide full assistance, and the government's shares can also be sold to ordinary merchants and people under market conditions. (2) It is a new initiative in recent years for foreigners to provide long-term credit in cash and materials for China's railway construction. (3) The construction, operation, management, and procurement of materials for the railway are all managed by Chinese personnel. The loan contract stipulates that two French personnel will be hired as technical staff. (4) The China Construction Bank is the sole trustee of the French banking group.</p>
<h3 id="e114">South Seas Commercial Inspection Group Hopes to Expand South Seas Routes, Requests China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to Organize <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Gao Shiheng, the former leader of the South Seas Commercial Inspection Group, recognizing the importance of the South Seas routes, not only for the convenience of cargo transportation but also for preventing national economic leakage, has repeatedly made suggestions to the government and various parties. Yesterday, he wrote to Director Cai of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, stating the eagerness of domestic and foreign industries and businesses for the South Seas routes, hoping that the company could open the Shanghai to Singapore and Shanghai to Siam routes as soon as possible, or organize joint operations with overseas Chinese shipping companies along the way. The original letter stated: "The patriotic enthusiasm of overseas Chinese in the South Seas is beyond description. They are particularly concerned about the rise and fall of the motherland's shipping industry. They are all pleased with the thriving state of your company and hope that your company can take a further step to open up the South Seas routes, prevent national economic leakage, and facilitate the transportation of national goods. Based on my humble opinion, I would like to request your company to open up the two most essential routes first. The first route is from Shanghai via Xiamen and Hong Kong to Singapore. The second route is from Shanghai via Shantou and Hong Kong to Siam. Each route should have two round trips per month, with cargo transportation as the main business for the time being. The industrial and commercial sectors in Singapore and Siam are dominated by overseas Chinese, so the cargo transportation on both routes will definitely be prosperous. However, in the initial stage of establishment, there may be losses in terms of the company's own income. However, from the perspective of the national economy, every penny earned from the South Seas routes is a leakage that is recovered, and its benefit to the national economy is immeasurable. As a state-owned shipping company, your company should focus on this long-term management and will surely be happy to engage in it. If it is temporarily difficult to open up the above-mentioned routes, then I would like to request that you organize joint operations with overseas Chinese shipping companies. The first route can be contacted with the shipping company run by overseas Chinese in Singapore. The second route can be contacted with the Chen Hongli Shipping Company in Bangkok. The company's ships regularly travel between Siam, Shantou, and Hong Kong, with several trips every ten days. The company is represented by Qian Tailong at 27 Man Wai Street, Hong Kong, and by Bo Ning Company in Shantou. Joint transportation and transshipment in Shantou or Hong Kong are extremely simple and convenient." It is reported that Director Cai Zengji has attached great importance to the points mentioned and has ordered the relevant departments to study them and will send personnel to investigate to make them a reality.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Pang Jingzhou Returns from the Front Lines, Talks in Detail About Opinions on Rescuing the Suiyuan War <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Pang Jingzhou of the China Red Cross Society Relief Committee has repeatedly traveled back and forth to handle relief matters since the outbreak of the Suiyuan War. The North China Temporary Branch of the China Red Cross Society Relief Committee has been established to actively implement the work. He has now returned to Shanghai this morning to raise medical supplies. According to Mr. Pang's statement to the Central News Agency reporter, his observations are as follows: "I first stayed in Beiping, then went to Suiyuan, and returned through Zhuozishan, Jining, and Datong, where I conducted on-the-ground inspections and planned relief equipment. I also had in-depth discussions with officers at all levels, so I have a more detailed understanding of the situation. I now offer the following opinions to those who are enthusiastic about comforting and assisting in relief work: (1) Regarding materials, provide large quantities so that they can be universally distributed. Otherwise, the supply will be insufficient and will inevitably be put aside, and the quality should be practical rather than exquisite. (A) Food should only be filling and does not need to be delicate. Biscuits, for example, do not seem to suit the stomach very well. (B) Gloves made of wool thread are not very durable and are best made of leather. (C) Gas masks are currently being developed by Gu Yuzhen, Dean of the College of Engineering of Tsinghua University, and the reporter (D) Silk cotton vests should be replaced with silk cotton clothing, and if they can be made of thick leather, they must be large in size to be warm and useful. (E) Bedding is not needed on the front lines, and there seems to be no need for it in the rear because there are many stoves. (2) Regarding relief workers, (A) Medicines should not be disorganized and should be the main medicines prescribed by the Military Medical Department. (B) Stretchers are not easily available on the front lines, and I hope that all sectors of society will donate them. The Red Cross Society has several samples of different materials on display for donors to refer to. (C) Relief personnel cannot serve on the front lines unless they have been trained and must be militarized. (D) There are very few suitable places for hospitals in Jin and Sui. Outside Datong City, near the Yungang Grottoes (scenic area), there are 300 houses for civilians that were previously donated by Chairman Chiang and others, but they have not yet been occupied. Each room is one zhang wide and one zhang two deep and can be used as a hospital for the wounded, but because there is a earthen pit in each room, which occupies half of the entire room, the entire building can accommodate a maximum of 1,200 wounded soldiers, and it is difficult to arrange hospital beds." In summary, these are the most important points that can be used as a reference for all sectors of society. Although the country has recently undergone major changes, everyone should remain calm and not forget to provide relief for the Suiyuan War.

<h3 id="e118">New Timetable of Two Railways to be Implemented on New Year's Day; Capital Express to Run Once Daily in Each Direction; Shortened Travel Time Between Beijing and Zhabei, No Longer via North Station <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The Joint Administration Bureau of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, upon order from the Ministry [of Railways], will launch a Capital Express train once daily in each direction on the Beijing-Shanghai Line. On the Shanghai-Zhabei section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Line, one express train will be reduced daily in each direction to align with current engine power conditions. The Traffic Department has already revised the timetables for the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo, and Suzhou-Jiaxing sections, which are approved to be implemented on New Year's Day. All staff and employees have been instructed to comply. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Notice to Staff and Employees</p>
<p>The Traffic Department hereby notifies all staff and employees that, upon order, the Beijing-Shanghai Line will increase the Capital Express by one train daily in each direction, and the Shanghai-Zhabei section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Line will reduce one express train daily in each direction, to align with the current engine power conditions. It is necessary to revise the timetables for each line accordingly. The speed of the Suzhou-Jiaxing Railway has been increased compared to before. All through-trains for passenger connecting service between Beijing and Zhabei will be rerouted via the Suzhou-Jiaxing Railway, with transfers at Wuxian and Jiaxing stations respectively, no longer passing through the North Station, in order to shorten travel time. Furthermore, after the timetables of the two railways are changed, the timetables of all trains on the Suzhou-Jiaxing Railway should also be revised to ensure connection with the trains on the two railways. The timetables for the two railways and the Suzhou-Jiaxing Railway have been revised and are ready to be implemented starting from January 1, 1937. All previous timetable charts issued by this department for the two railways and the Suzhou-Jiaxing Railway will be canceled from the same date. The composition of passenger trains, the operation of vehicles on the two railways and the Suzhou-Jiaxing Railway, and the train numbering method stipulated in Announcement Yun Zi No. 1210 of June 22, 1934, have also been revised as per the attached tables, effective from the same date. As for the current timetables, operating procedures, and train compositions of the trains on the Songhu and Caoyong sections, as well as the Shanghai-Xiangpu commuter trains, all will remain as before, except for the train numbers on the Caoyong section. The points that should be noted in this revised timetable are listed separately below, along with the No. 8 timetable for railway staff of the two railways and the Suzhou-Jiaxing Railway, the train numbering table, the passenger train composition table, and the vehicle operation table, which are hereby distributed for your compliance.</p>
<p>Points to Note</p>
<p>Points to Note for the No. 8 Timetable: A. Regarding the Two Railways and the Suzhou-Jiaxing Railway: (1) Section Chiefs of each Traffic Section, Station Masters of each station, and all ticket inspectors should pay close attention to passenger density at all times, notify the Dispatching Section of the Transportation Department, and fill in the ticket inspector's service report, in order to increase or decrease the number of cars attached to the trains. If stations need to increase or decrease the number of cars due to circumstances, they must obtain the prior consent of the Dispatching Section of the Transportation Department. (2) Through-cars for passengers between Beijing and Zhabei will each use one first, second, and third-class baggage car. Down trains are attached to the third train of the Beijing-Shanghai Line to Wuxian Station, transferred to the 255th train of the Suzhou-Jiaxing Railway to Jiaxing Station, and transferred to the 31st train of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Line to Zhabei. Up trains are attached to the 12th train of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Line to Jiaxing Station, transferred to the 254th train of the Suzhou-Jiaxing Railway to Wuxian Station, and transferred to the 22nd train of the Beijing-Shanghai Line to Beijing.

When operating on the Suzhou-Jiaxing Railway, they should be attached after the conductor's car at the end.</p>
<p>Beijing-Shanghai Line</p>
<p>B. Regarding the Beijing-Shanghai Line: (3) If passengers at Nanjing and Kunshan stations who have purchased through tickets to ride the 302nd Shanghai-Pinghu through-train declare at their respective stations 20 minutes before the train departs from the North Station, the station masters of each station should telegraph the station master of the North Station to make arrangements in advance. The station master of the North Station will issue a stop order, temporarily stopping the train at the relevant stations. (4) If through passengers on the 301st Shanghai-Pinghu through-train wish to disembark at Kunshan Station or Nanxiang Station, they should declare to the Nanjing Station Master in advance, or when Nanjing Station has received a telegram notification from the Railway, the Nanjing Station Master should issue a stop order, temporarily stopping the train at the relevant stations. (5) When the 44th Shanghai-Zhenjiang second and fourth-class commuter train departs from the North Station, it is not allowed to sell fourth-class tickets from the North Station to the three stations before it: Kunshan, Wuxian, and Wuxi, in order to alleviate congestion. (6) The 4th Shanghai-Beijing Express stops at Shitangwan Station, the 5th Beijing-Shanghai Express and the 7th Beijing-Shanghai Night Express stop at Henglin Station, the 6th Shanghai-Beijing Special Express and the 8th Shanghai-Beijing Night Express stop at Benniu Station, and the 21st Beijing-Shanghai Express stops at Xiashu and Zhoujingxiang Stations. All stops are due to meeting arrangements and no passenger tickets to or from these stations will be sold. If the meeting location changes, or the train to be met has already arrived at the station, the above trains will immediately cancel their stops at the respective stations. (7) The 4th Shanghai-Beijing Special Express and the 5th Beijing-Shanghai Special Express each attach through-cars for Shanghai-Wuhu connection, including one first and second-class car and one third-class baggage, postal, and conductor car, which are transferred at Yaohuamen Station, directly connecting Shanghai and Wuhu. These through-cars are attached at the rear of the train. (8) The 501st and 502nd freight trains are specifically for transporting less-than-carload (LCL) freight. The number of cars is limited to 1,000 metric tons, or the total length of the train is limited to 300 meters. If the LCL freight is not enough for a full train, the Dispatching Office of the Transportation Department may allocate other vehicles as appropriate. Stations along the way that wish to add or detach vehicles must first consult with the Transportation Department and obtain consent before proceeding. If there is no loading or unloading of goods at the designated stopping stations, the stop should be canceled. If unloading is required at stations not designated to stop, a temporary stop may be made. The stop order should be issued by the loading station. If goods are to be loaded, the loading station may also contact the nearest large station in advance and issue a stop order to temporarily stop. However, the Transportation Department must be notified by dispatcher telephone in advance in all cases. All loading and unloading procedures must be completed in the shortest possible time, and strict adherence to on-time arrival at the terminating station must be maintained. 9. If there are not enough goods to fill a train for the 401st, 402nd, 403rd, and 404th connecting freight trains, other freight cars from this railway may be attached.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Line</p>
<p>C. Regarding the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Line, 10. The 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th Shanghai-Zhabei special express trains all detach a portion of the cars to go directly to and depart from Shangnan Station. 11. If staff from the Jianqiao Central Aviation School wish to take the 13th Shanghai-Zhabei special express train from the North Station to Jianqiao Station, they may request the Station Master of the North Station with written proof from the school in advance. Or, if they wish to take the 14th Zhabei-Shanghai special express train from Jianqiao Station to the North Station, they may request the Station Master of the Jianqiao Station with a written request from the school two hours before the train arrives at Jianqiao Station. In either case, the train will be allowed to stop at Jianqiao Station. 12. The 801st and 802nd freight trains are specifically for carrying less-than-carload (LCL) freight. If there is excess engine power, full carload vehicles may be added.</p>
<p>Suzhou-Jiaxing Railway</p>
<p>D. Regarding the Suzhou-Jiaxing Railway, 13. When empty or loaded freight cars are attached to mixed trains, up trains are limited to being attached behind the locomotive, and down trains are limited to being attached before the conductor's car at the rear, in order to suit the existing platform conditions at Wuxian and Jiaxing stations. If livestock cars are attached, the circumstances should be considered to ensure that they are separated from passenger cars by a reasonable distance.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Real Estate Industry Union Petitions for Reduced Land Tax; Yesterday, They Submitted a Petition to the Municipal Government, Explaining the Drastic Drop in Land Values; Requesting the Land Bureau to Reassess Land Values and Reduce Tax Amounts <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Industry Association submitted a petition to the Municipal Government yesterday requesting the Municipal Government to instruct the Land Bureau to reassess land values and reduce land taxes. The petition stated: "Petition for instructing the Land Bureau to reassess land values and reduce tax amounts to alleviate the burden and show sympathy. The land prices in Shanghai have plummeted in recent years due to the decline in commerce and the exhaustion of the market. The real estate industry has suffered the most. As a result of this trend, there have been frequent cases of families going bankrupt. This situation is already well known to the Municipal Government. The land tax is based on the market value assessed by the previous Land Bureau Valuation Committee for collection. It has been many years. Due to the current economic recession, there is no hope of recovery in the short term. Landlords are mostly complying with tenants' requests and voluntarily reducing rents. However, on the other hand, they are still painfully paying the land tax according to the previously assessed amount. This has been the case for a long time. However, it is an economic principle that taxes are derived from rents. Now that land values have clearly plummeted and rents have been generally reduced, it is unfair to continue collecting land taxes according to the previously assessed tax amount. The association has repeatedly received complaints from its members, requesting that the land value be reassessed so that the land tax can be reduced. Therefore, we are submitting this petition to the Municipal Government for review and approval to instruct the Land Bureau to reassess the land value in each district and reduce the tax amount from 1937 onwards, in order to be fair and relieve the difficulties of businesses. We are waiting anxiously for your order." Respectfully submitted to Wu, Mayor of the Shanghai Municipal Government.</p>

<h3 id="e128">Customs Brokers and Others Negotiate with Six Companies <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Refusal of Requests Leads to Suspension of Operations</p>
<p>After six companies, including the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the private Sanbei Company, Jiu Shao Company, British-owned Taikoo Company, Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., and Japanese-owned Nissin Steamship Co., announced that water freight charges for various ports along the Yangtze River would be collected according to the weight on the scales, the Shanghai Transportation and Customs Brokers Association and the Shanghai Businessmen's Association jointly opposed this. After a meeting, it was decided that if the companies did not agree to their request, operations would be suspended. The two associations jointly announced: "Regarding the statement by the six shipping companies that, starting from December 15th, all goods transported to various ports along the Yangtze River and charged according to weight will be subject to the rates determined by the Pingzhun Company scales, we have sent numerous letters and delegated representatives to demand the cancellation of the new rule. The six companies have agreed to hold a meeting this Wednesday to discuss the matter. After convening a joint meeting, our association has resolved that, regardless of the outcome of the six companies' discussion, we insist that water freight charges be calculated based on the weight declared to customs for tax purposes. If the companies do not agree to our request, we will have no choice but to suspend operations pending a resolution." Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the six companies held a joint meeting and decided to send representatives to negotiate with the Transportation and Customs Brokers Association and the Shanghai Businessmen's Association to resolve the issue, and agreed to temporarily postpone the implementation of the collection of water freight charges based on the scales for various ports along the Yangtze River.</p>

<h3 id="e129">Robbery on Avenue Haig: One Thief Killed, Two Captured - Guns and Knives Found in Chamber Pots - Stolen Foreign Currency of $390 Recovered <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Lu Maoyuan, a native of Shaoxing, runs the Yong Tai Mao Ji tobacco and currency exchange shop at 534 Avenue Haig. At around 6:00 AM yesterday morning, while Lu was still fast asleep, four robbers armed with guns and knives arrived to rob the shop. They pried open the door and crept inside. Lu's wife, Mrs. Xi, happened to be coming downstairs in her robe when she was stopped and ordered not to move. The robbers then searched the shop, eventually stealing over 300 yuan in foreign currency before fleeing with the loot. Seeing the robbers leave, Mrs. Xi rushed upstairs and woke up the apprentice, Lu Arong, telling him about the robbery. Upon hearing the news, Lu Arong immediately ran downstairs, chased after the robbers outside the shop, and enlisted the help of two neighbors from a nearby brokerage shop. They saw the four robbers turn south into Jinjiazhai Lane along Avenue Haig and enter No. 2, Lane 762 on Chengdu Road. Lu immediately reported to the patrol, who promptly informed the police station. A large number of Chinese and foreign detectives were dispatched to the scene. Just as they were about to rush into the lane to apprehend the robbers, a shot suddenly rang out from a dark corner of a small alley. The detectives returned fire and bravely charged in, killing one robber on the spot with a bullet to the right side of his head, and seizing a gun. Two robbers were captured alive. After being taken to the police station for interrogation, they identified themselves as Wang Acai, 31 years old, and Tian Linchang, 29 years old, both from Ningbo. The dead robber was identified as Zhou Jiaxiang, 29 years old, from Chaozhou, who lived in an upper room behind a small house in the lane. The detectives then searched the premises again, finding Zhou's mistress, Ms. Li, and her daughter, Gendi. They also found another gun and a knife in a chamber pot, as well as 390 yuan in stolen foreign currency in a chest of drawers. All were taken back to the police station for safekeeping, awaiting submission to the court for investigation and prosecution this morning. The robber's body has been sent to the coroner for examination.</p>

<p>Ten o'clock in the morning on the twenty-first</p>
<p>Baoshan County is connected to Shanghai's Hudu and bordered by the sea on three sides, with fresh air and convenient transportation, making it ideal for patients to recuperate. However, previously, there was no hospital of substantial scale. Although there were one or two clinics, due to limited finances and rudimentary equipment, they were almost beyond repair. Starting in the twenty-fifth year, the provincial government proposed establishing county hospitals throughout the province, issuing a general order to all opium suppression bureaus in the province. Any county opium suppression bureau that had not yet established a county hospital was required to begin operations in the twenty-fifth year and to start preparations immediately. Shen Ruohan, the director of the Baoshan County Opium Suppression Bureau, received an appointment order in July of the twenty-fifth year to serve as the chief of the county hospital preparatory office, with instructions to expedite preparations. He selected the site of the existing clinic in the county seat as the hospital site. At the same time, he prepared an estimated budget for start-up costs and operating expenses and submitted it to the county for forwarding to the province. Starting in September, he added an obstetrician and staff and reported the establishment of the hospital that month. Meanwhile, he took over the clinic for renovation and repairs and temporarily established a treatment department at the opium suppression bureau to begin medical work. On November 4, he received an appointment order from the Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, appointing Shen Ruohan as the hospital director and issuing the county hospital seal. On November 25, he received approval for the start-up cost budget. At the same time, the hospital site was also completed, and the purchase of equipment and instruments could be done soon. The opening ceremony is now scheduled for December 21. From then on, the health of the entire county will be protected. Not only are the people of the county overjoyed, but patients from Shanghai who wish to be admitted to the hospital can reach the hospital in a few tens of minutes for a peaceful recuperation.</p>

<p>Tang Youren, former Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Transportation, a native of Hunan, was assassinated on December 25 of last year in front of his private residence, Gan Village, on Rue Gaston in the French Concession. The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau and the French Concession Police have successively apprehended the perpetrators of the case, Liu Zhennan and Qiu Jiyu. They were brought back by the French police, escorted to the Special No. 2 Court for interrogation and detention, and the case was adjourned for further questioning. This has been reported in this newspaper. At 10:00 AM yesterday, the scheduled continuation of the trial took place. The French police escorted the two defendants, Liu and Qiu, to the criminal division of the Special No. 2 Court, where Criminal Judge Wang Gangxu, accompanied by Clerk Gao Yanmao, took the bench for questioning. According to Fei Xizhen, the lawyer for the police department, the police department's investigation of the case has not yet been completed, and a request was made for a two-week extension to complete the investigation procedures before filing a lawsuit for trial. The court questioned the defendants. Liu confessed to firing one shot, and Qiu admitted to firing four or five shots. At the time, they and the fugitives Yang Yousheng, Xiao Kaihui, and Xiang Xingchang and others, a total of five people, carried out the assassination together. "We have now confessed, so what else is there to investigate?" They also said that they were treated poorly in the police station, with insufficient food, and requested to be transferred to the detention center. The court reviewed the confessions, instructed that the case be adjourned until the thirtieth for further questioning, and ruled that the defendants could not be transferred to the detention center while the case was still under investigation, so they were returned to the police station.</p>

<p>Gu Zhuxuan, a native of Yancheng, was involved in the case of instigating the assassination of Tang Jiapeng, as well as the case of bribing guards to buy off inmates Zhao Guangfu and Zhang Tinggui to recant their testimony and fabricate false evidence. The murder case is currently under third instance appeal at the Supreme Court, and the case of instigating false evidence is still under trial at the Special No. 2 Court. Gu has submitted petitions to both the Supreme Court and the Special No. 2 Court requesting bail and suspension of detention. The Special No. 2 Court ruled that he should find two reputable shopkeepers to provide a written guarantee of 20,000 yuan, guaranteeing his presence whenever summoned, and allowing the suspension of detention. The Third Branch of the High Court also convened a court session the day before yesterday afternoon, ruling that he should provide a cash guarantee of 7,000 yuan, plus two reputable shopkeepers to provide a written guarantee of 10,000 yuan, guaranteeing his presence whenever summoned, and allowing the suspension of detention. These details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that Gu's family has been searching for shopkeepers to act as guarantors for days, and has persuaded the owners of the Wanchang Rice Shop and the Xingxinchi Bathhouse to provide a written guarantee of 20,000 yuan. After submitting the guarantee to the court and having the police verify it, at around 3:00 PM yesterday, Judge Chen summoned the two guarantors in the Sixth Tribunal, approved their guarantee for Gu Zhuxuan's release. Regarding the Second Branch of the High Court, Gu's family persuaded the owners of two factories to provide a written guarantee of 10,000 yuan, and submitted shares of the Great World Company to the court as cash. After investigation, the court returned the shares and instructed them to submit other securities or cash. As a result, these procedures could not be completed yesterday afternoon and must be done again today. Gu's family, wives, relatives, and friends, such as Zheng Jianyi, Zhao Ruquan, Zhao Junyu, Ma Honggen, lawyer Wang Jishi, and lawyer Wu Lun, waited until 5:00 PM, intending to welcome Gu Zhuxuan home, but when the court bell rang signaling the end of the day, the bail procedures had not yet been completed. Gu could not be released, so they all dispersed. It is estimated that Gu will regain his freedom today or tomorrow.</p>

<p>Li Xiaobao, former head of the Ximen Branch of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau's Investigation Team, along with his apprentice, investigator Jin Yushan, and team leader Lu Jinchun, were accused of colluding with notorious bandits Xu Xueqin, Yang Defu, Shi Dachengzi, and Zhang Faquan to repeatedly rob shops and residences in Zhabei. They also robbed police officers Zhang Rongjun and Yang Shichao of one pistol each. When the Public Security Bureau strictly ordered their arrest, Lu Jinchun and others were ordered to frame innocent civilians Liu Weizhen, Xu Helin, and Huang Zhenghong, subjecting them to torture and nearly leading them to death. These investigators not only obtained wealth but also received credit and rewards, feeling complacent. Unexpectedly, their secret was discovered by Liang Yu, the former leader of the Second Team, who investigated them. Li Xiaobao then escorted the bandits to other areas, but they were all intercepted by Liang. Li Xiaobao and Jin Yushan deserted their posts and fled in fear of punishment, while Lu Jinchun was unable to escape and was detained and transferred to the local court. The defendants were prosecuted for colluding with bandits and dereliction of duty. Yesterday, Judge Wu Xiangzu continued the trial. Lu Jinchun, Xu Xueqin, and others all denied the charges. The court noted that the original handlers who solved the case at the time were Liang Yu and investigators Wu Xiufeng and Gao Quchuan. They were summoned for further questioning, and the defendants were returned to custody.</p>

<p>Xu Xueseng, former Director of the Gansu Opium Suppression Bureau, was splashed with nitric acid on his face in March of this year on Wangzhi Road in the French Concession, suffering serious injuries. The perpetrator, Gao Jinsheng, was apprehended and sentenced to four years in prison, and the case is currently under appeal. Meanwhile, Xu Xueseng also filed a private lawsuit in the local court, accusing Zhu Guanghan, a wealthy man from Songjiang, of instigating Chen Axi to instruct Gao Jinsheng to harm him, and seeking 100,000 yuan in damages. Zhu, through his lawyers Gu Changyuan and others, filed a counterclaim for false accusation, claiming that it was a malicious accusation of seeking 100,000 yuan due to an unsuccessful loan. Yesterday, Judge Liu Bojun reopened the trial. First, Zhu Guanghan was questioned. He stated that he was 41 years old, from Songjiang, residing on Foch Road, and formerly ran a sauce garden. Chen Axi stated that he was 35 years old, from Suzhou, residing at 3 Guling Road, watching the house. Jiang Weicheng stated that he was 47 years old. Fang Aliu stated that he was 27 years old, from Ningbo, residing at the Xiaocai Market in Hongkou, selling beef for a living. Then, the court questioned the witness Fang Aliu: "Are you friends with Gao Jinsheng?" He replied, "No, I am not." The court asked, "You said earlier that Gao Jinsheng asked you to bring out a letter, saying that Zhu Guanghan instigated it?" He replied, "This was Xu Xueseng who told me to say that. It was on July 17 in the teahouse. He told me to bite Zhu Guanghan. I have not taken any money from Xu. I am speaking from my conscience." The court said, "The letter has the inspection stamp of the Special No. 2 Court Detention Center." The defendant's lawyer immediately retorted, "Whether it was sent by Gao Jinsheng should be investigated." At this point, Xu Xueseng presented an indictment against Gu Changyuan for destroying evidence, saying that he was highly suspected and requesting a legal investigation. He also stated that Zhang Qizhao could not attend the court, but there was a handwritten letter from Zhang to prove it. The court then asked Jiang Weicheng and Feng Zhiming, "Where do you currently reside?" They replied, "19 Lane 8, Zhangjiazhai Road." The court then remarked that this case has been delayed for too long, and if both parties have evidence, they should submit it immediately. The case was adjourned to summon Feng Zhiming for further questioning, and then to begin the debate. The defendant still requested bail and retained lawyer He Xianzhang. The court then adjourned.</p>

<p>After the Tongyi Trust Company ceased operations, it was discovered that it had illegally pledged a large amount of public bonds deposited by trust clients. The creditors have filed lawsuits with the court, which are ongoing. It is now learned that the pledged bank, because the bonds have matured, sold them at market price. After deducting the loan and interest, there was a remaining balance of 137,431.42 yuan. Of this amount, 33,978.17 yuan belonging to the Bank of China cannot be released due to a separate guarantee relationship. The remaining loan amounts from other banks have been transferred to the company's bankruptcy administrator, who has prepared a distribution table and submitted it to the court. It has now been announced that the court has approved the distribution, and starting from the fifteenth, payments will be made at the bankruptcy administrator's office.

<h3 id="e145">Ding Huikang Lectures on "Disease Insurance and National Health" at the Anti-Tuberculosis Exhibition Yesterday <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Exhibition invited Dr. Ding Huikang to lecture yesterday on "Disease Insurance and National Health." His speech was insightful and incisive, and excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>The Meaning of Disease Insurance</p>
<p>As society progresses, human affairs become more complex, and people are more susceptible to illness. The burden of medical expenses also increases. For the average family, it is not difficult to accurately budget various income and expenditure items, but medical expenses are difficult to predict. The onset of illness is unexpected, and the need for medical care often depletes several years' savings. This is true even for those who are financially capable. Those who are economically disadvantaged and unable to seek medical care are even more numerous. This is the reason for the prevalence of disease insurance organizations in various countries. Therefore, the average family treats disease insurance premiums as a necessary expense. By paying a small monthly fee, they can avoid unpredictable medical expenses and protect the health and well-being of individuals and families through medical security. There is no better way. It is a pity that our country does not yet have such an organization.</p>
<p>Insurance Situation in Various Countries</p>
<p>Disease insurance organizations are divided into two types: public and private. Public disease insurance began in 1871. Those insured are workers, and the premiums paid do not exceed 300 gold. In Germany, for example, there are approximately 20 million insured persons, paying more than 1.2 billion marks annually. In America, it reaches 360 million yuan, and in Russia, it is 250 million rubles. The development of medicine relies entirely on this type of organization for active construction and success. This type of insurance is compulsory, so store owners or managers have a reporting obligation. The expenses are generally borne one-third by the store owner or company and two-thirds by the employees. The premium is approximately 4% to 7% of the monthly salary.</p>
<p>Public Disease Insurance</p>
<p>Public disease insurance is entirely for the benefit of salaried workers. For example, hospital rooms are limited to ordinary third-class wards, and prescriptions cannot be used to purchase prepared medicines. All doctors are divided into treatment areas, and each doctor has a set limit on the number of patients they should treat. The insurance organization then allocates 17% or 20% of its total income annually for doctors' treatment fees. Hospital expenses are also limited. For example, in hospitals in Hamburg, the daily fee is 6.8 marks, including various surgeries, X-rays, and medical expenses. Those insured under this type of insurance are entitled to disease benefits when they are ill, meaning that if the head of a family is hospitalized due to illness, in addition to medical expenses, their family can also receive living expenses.</p>
<p>Private Disease Insurance</p>
<p>Private disease insurance differs from public insurance in that it is not tied to specific doctors. Insured individuals can invite their private physicians for treatment, pay the doctors or hospitals themselves, and then claim reimbursement from the insurance organization.</p>
<p>We Should Catch Up Quickly</p>
<p>In our country now, most doctors do not have a fixed income, and patients are unable to afford medical care. Doctors act independently, without a unified and cooperative approach. Not only does medicine not advance, but it also affects the degeneration of the nation. Observing that medical progress in various countries is directly proportional to the health of their citizens, our country should quickly catch up with this type of disease insurance organization and seek to establish such an insurance organization soon. If the whole country responds enthusiastically, then the day when insurance is popularized will be the day when our country's anti-tuberculosis efforts and medical construction succeed.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Court Sternly Interrogates Cai Fufu and Witnesses in the Wang Jindi Sudden Death Case; Cai's Concubine Dies in Chen Xinglin's Home; Spectator Urged to Wait to Urinate; Court Clerk Detained for Preventing Witness Collusion <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Cai Fufu, also known as Cai Xuzhou, a local Shanghai resident, operated the Mingyuelou Teahouse on Xiaoshabo Road and Baima Road and also engaged in real estate. He was over forty years old, but he was fond of women. He had previously enticed Wang Ye'gen's daughter, Jindi, who lived at 20 Caishi Lane, Rue Robert, because she often went to Mingyuelou to watch Tanhuang opera. Cai coveted her, used every means to court her, and designed to seduce her. Jindi was deceived and, on April 11 of this year, was invited out by Cai and taken to Room 36 of the Hongxiang Hotel on Avenue Haig. Cai raped Jindi. Unexpectedly, the matter was discovered by Jindi's parents, who went to catch them in the act and apprehended both of them. Later, after Cai repeatedly pleaded, the matter was not reported to the police station. Cai paid a sum of money to cover up the scandal. Who knew that on May 11, Jindi suddenly disappeared again. At the time, Jindi's parents knew that Cai was not without suspicion, but because they could not determine where their daughter was hidden, they temporarily endured and secretly investigated, but after several months, it was like a stone sinking into the sea, with no news at all. Until November 16 of this year, Jindi's uncle, Chen Xinglin, suddenly went to Wang Ye'gen's home with a message, claiming that Jindi had died suddenly in his home. Wang and Chen had rarely visited each other due to disagreements. Upon hearing the bad news, Wang was overcome with grief. After arguing with Chen, Chen revealed that Jindi had been hidden in his home for a long time, initially sent by Cai Fufu. At that time, Jindi appeared to be ill, reportedly caused by Cai's drunken misconduct. Cai also knew that Chen and Wang Ye'gen were not on good terms, so he hid Jindi in Chen's place, assuming that it would not be leaked. Unexpectedly, Jindi fell ill and died. Unable to hide the matter any longer, he informed Wang Ye'gen's wife. Wang Ye'gen, believing that his daughter's death was unclear, rushed to report to the Caojiadu Public Security Sub-Bureau and petitioned the local court for an autopsy. He also filed a criminal self-accusation with the local court, accusing Chen Xinglin and his wife and Cai Fufu of obstructing family affairs. After the court approved the petition, several trials have been conducted. It is learned that the case was reopened at 9:00 AM yesterday in the Criminal Division of the District Court by Judge Wang Shanxiang. The plaintiff, Wang Ye'gen, was detained in the First Special District Court due to a debt dispute and was not present. His lawyer, Qu Cheng, appeared in court. However, Judge Wang stated that Lawyer Qu had not yet submitted his power of attorney to the court and could not appear in court according to law, so he was dismissed as a spectator. He then immediately summoned the defendants and witnesses to state their names and ages, and ordered them all to leave the courtroom for separate questioning. First, Cai Fufu was questioned about the abduction of Wang Jindi. Cai claimed that Jindi was his concubine and that matchmakers Yin Jubao, Cai Futang's wife, and Yao Gengsheng and his wife had acted as intermediaries. After Judge Wang obtained the testimony, he continued to ask detailed questions. After Cai finished testifying, he ordered the court clerk to summon the witness Yao Gengsheng and others. Unexpectedly, at this time, a person in the audience stood up to leave, saying that he needed to urinate. Judge Wang, believing that the case was of great importance and fearing that someone would collude, quickly stopped him and ordered him to wait until all the witnesses were brought to the courtroom before being released. Before the court's instructions were completed, Judge Wang caught a glimpse of the witnesses Yao Gengsheng and others listening outside the courtroom door. Judge Wang believed that the court clerk was derelict in his duty and immediately announced that the trial would be temporarily suspended. He asked the court clerk in the courtroom to invite the chief court clerk to the court and informed him of what had happened. The chief court clerk believed that the court clerk was suspected of colluding with the defendants and witnesses and ordered his temporary detention. Judge Wang then resumed the proceedings and continued to question the witnesses. He had not finished questioning them by noon, so he ruled that the case would be adjourned for retrial.</p>

<p>Zheng Yizhi, a wealthy businessman from Chaozhou living in Shanghai, operated many businesses in Shanghai during his lifetime, such as the Changfu and Guangde pawnshops on Weihaiwei Road, as well as a certain former earthwork business. He was a major shareholder, and therefore accumulated considerable wealth. More than ten years ago, Zheng Yizhi died of illness in Shanghai, leaving behind more than 200,000 yuan in property, which he entrusted to his brothers Zheng Qiting and Zheng Jianzhi to manage temporarily. Zheng Yizhi's children, Zheng Guoxiao and Zheng Yuezhen, represented by their mother, Zheng Zhang Shuyun, as their legal representative, jointly retained lawyers Sun Zuji and Du Xi to file a lawsuit with the Civil Division of the First Special Court, requesting mediation with Zheng Yizhi's brothers Zheng Hongting, Zheng Jianzhi, Zheng Zuo Zhi, and Zheng Huizhi. The reason was that the property was managed without reporting accounts, and they requested that they be ordered to hand over the investigation, summoned for mediation. The grounds were stated as follows: The father of the petitioners Zheng Guoxiao, Zheng Yizhi, died of illness in Shanghai in the past year. The property he left behind, worth more than three million yuan, at the time of easy money, because the petitioners were either women or young children, was entrusted to his younger brothers, that is, the opposing parties, to jointly manage temporarily. However, for more than ten years, they have not reported any accounts, so the petitioners are completely unaware of the status of all the properties, and they are deeply afraid that after a long time, there will be no way to check. They have sent letters to the opposing parties requesting that they be opened and sent for review, but they were ignored. For this reason, they legally request a summons for mediation, ordering the opposing parties to jointly be responsible for handing over the accounts of the property managed on their behalf for the petitioners to check, so as to be able to audit it. Yesterday morning, this case was mediated by Judge Guo Wei in the Fourteenth Civil Court. Zheng Hongting and others also sent representatives to the court. As a result, the mediation failed, and they will wait for a formal lawsuit to be filed separately.</p>

<p>Zhuang Changrong and His Wife Commit Assault; Gu Chen Clan Faints After Recent Childbirth</p>
<p>Gu A'si, a native of Dongtai residing near the Hujia Wood Bridge in Zhabei, went to a cigarette bridge vendor with his wife Gu Chen Clan around 4:00 PM the day before yesterday to purchase gloves from Zhuang Changrong, a native of Zhenjiang. A dispute arose over the price, which escalated into a physical altercation. As the two sides were grappling with each other, Zhuang's wife suddenly rushed out from the side to help her husband beat Gu. She kicked Gu Chen Clan's vagina, who had just given birth last month. After being kicked, blood flowed down her pants, and she fainted and fell to the ground. After the police arrived, the assailants Zhuang Changrong and his wife, together with the injured woman, were taken to the Linping Road Police Station and transferred to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and transfered to the court for review.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Embezzlement of Gold Nib Points: Jiang Zuling Convicted <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Sentenced to Six Months Imprisonment</p>
<p>Jiang Zuling, a Ningbo native and manager of the Huahua Gold Nib Factory at No. 39 Bowuyuan Road, accumulated debts due to his recent marriage. He embezzled 290 gross (打) of nib points from the factory, worth over 3,000 yuan, and exchanged them for over 1,202 yuan at the Laotianbao Silver Shop. After the factory discovered this, they reported it to the General Inspectorate. Chinese Detective Ni Jiaxin arrested Jiang, his wife Jiang Ge, and his mother-in-law Ge Lin in room 106 of the Tongshang Hotel, seizing stolen money amounting to 1,085 yuan. They were handed over to the First Special District Court for trial, as previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Qian Hongye continued the trial in a criminal court. The Huahua Factory engaged lawyer Tang Mingshi, who attended court to bring a civil suit, requesting that in addition to the recovered funds, the shortfall be ordered to be repaid. After Judge Qian's investigation, he ordered the commencement of arguments. The detective's lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, requested that he be punished according to the crime of embezzlement of business property. The court then and there sentenced Jiang Zuling to six months' imprisonment for embezzling property held in the course of business, and ordered him to repay the plaintiff 2,412.55 yuan in national currency. Jiang Ge and Ge Lin were acquitted of receiving stolen goods.</p>
<h3 id="e150">To Protect Dock Passengers, Please Guard Against Petty Ruffians <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Taking advantage of small steamers arriving at the port to seize property, please ask the police station to dispatch detectives to patrol.</p>
<p>Xing Zhigang, the district head of the 5th district of Shanghai County, stated that to deal with robbers who occupy the docks and disturb the journeys of fellow countrymen, he had requested the Shanghai Public Security Bureau to conduct strict searches. He stated that the public pier for small steamers at No. 18 Dongjiadu, Nanshi, is where passengers from Shangfeng, Nanchuan, and other counties and towns, as well as the Minnan and Pinghu steamer docks at the Outer Guanjiao Bridge, are the locations where passengers from Pinghu, Minhang, and other towns north along the river arrive and depart. Recently, local ruffians led dozens of petty thieves, scattered in the alleyways around these steamer piers. As soon as the small steamers arrive, they take advantage of the confusion of passengers carrying items ashore to seize property. When they see someone weak and vulnerable, they openly rob and snatch, and the passengers, fearing to lose more, let them leave with their spoils, shouting loudly and going on their way, with passersby looking on, but daring not do anything. This seriously harms the ports and passengers, and is greatly related to public safety. He has specially written to the Bureau, requesting a prompt order to the 16th Sub-Bureau and the Dongjiadu Police Station in charge, to dispatch capable detectives to the No. 18 small steamer, the public pier, and the Minnan and Pinghu steamer piers, to patrol and guard closely, and to arrest and investigate these criminals in order to quell the banditry and ensure the safety of passengers.</p>

<p>Ye Qinghua, the younger brother of Ye Qinghe, a Fujianese international drug trafficker who is currently at large, was recently sued in the Second Special Court by Wu Yu, a woman from the same village, for criminal seduction, violation of public morals, and abandonment. The court ordered Wu, along with a bailiff, to summon Ye Qinghua. This led to Ye, along with his wife Yang Zhuxia and his Hong Kong girlfriend Chen Rong, assaulting and injuring Wu. Wu then added a charge of joint assault against Ye Qinghua, Yang Zhuxia, Chen Rong, and others. The case has been heard several times in a consolidated trial, but because Chen Rong has failed to appear, the court has ordered a postponement until she is summoned again for a further hearing. These matters have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, the court was convened again for a further hearing. The defendant Chen Rong still did not appear. Judge Sun Pengxian convened the court, but because Chen Rong and the witness Ye Xijun had not reported, the plaintiff Wu Yu requested that an arrest warrant or wanted notice be issued for Chen Rong. In addition, she stated that a Mr. Shi, a guest at the Dacheng Apartment No. 18, could be summoned to testify and prove the defendants' assault. The court approved the issuance of an arrest warrant for Chen Rong and ordered the witnesses to be summoned for a further hearing on the 23rd.</p>

<p>Jiang Rong, a 40-year-old Ningbo native from No. 3 Renshoufang, Yaojialong, was a fruit vendor who had left his hometown. Last September, he married a fellow villager, Ms. Ren (22 years old), through a matchmaker. After the marriage, all of Jiang's income was handed over to Ms. Ren for management. Unexpectedly, Ms. Ren became involved with Zheng Chunqing. In October, Jiang found that the money managed by his wife Ren for more than two months was insufficient for their needs. Jiang then questioned his wife, but Ms. Ren became angry and fled without a trace, taking clothing and money with her. Until yesterday afternoon at 4:30, Jiang's colleagues, Xu A'fa and Li Ruihong, were working at Ning Shao Wharf when they suddenly saw Jiang Ren, accompanied by two young men, boarding a ship back to Ningbo. They immediately reported to the police on duty, who brought them into the police station. It was determined that the case involved the mainland, and they were sent to the Yemiao Police Station for investigation. It was determined that the case was related to abduction and escape, and they were handed over to the Bureau for legal action.</p>

<p>Ye Xizhang, a 40-year-old Ningbo native, lived at No. 30, Dekangli, Qiujiang Road. He used to run a laundry on Qiujiang Road to make a living. During the January 28th Incident, his shop was burned down and he has been unable to resume business since. He has a wife and four children, and is struggling to make ends meet. Yesterday morning at six o'clock, after getting up, Ye saw that he was about to run out of food. Overcome with grief, he became pessimistic and went out alone. At 8:30, he arrived at the Yangshupu Lan Road Wharf and jumped into the river from the foreign iron barge to commit suicide. Fortunately, he was spotted by a Chinese policeman from the Customs Water Patrol, who quickly rescued him and took him to the police station. However, Ye suddenly became confused due to excessive nervous stimulation and shouted, "The enemy soldiers are attacking! My family's property has all been destroyed!" After a while, he regained his composure and told the truth, weeping as he spoke. The police chief ordered detective Xu Lenian to escort him home and instructed his wife to comfort him well to prevent him from repeating the attempt.</p>

<p>Xi Shun Jin, a plasterer from Gou Nanbang, Xinjiao Port, Peidong, had a wife, Xi Liu, who was 40 years old. They had four children, and the cost of living was high, so the couple's hard work was barely enough to make ends meet. Recently, Xi Shunjin lost his job, and the children, being ignorant, cried for food. The woman found it difficult to be a clever wife without rice, and filled with resentment, she hanged herself at home the night before. When her husband, Xi Shunjin, found out and tried to save her, it was too late. Yesterday, he reported to the Donggou Police Station, which ordered the local bailiff Zhou Jichang to report to the local court for an autopsy.</p>

<p>Lu Lindi, a 20-year-old woman from Huangdu, is considered to be reasonably attractive. Her parents, who live at No. 12 Tokyo Road, Huxi, love her dearly and couldn't bear to let her marry out, so four years ago they took in Lu Rongbao, a 34-year-old local man (who works as a cook in a Westerner's house), as a son-in-law. They have lived together ever since, and the relationship has been generally harmonious. However, in the spring of this year, Lu Rongbao learned that his wife was engaging in improper conduct. Lacking concrete evidence, he mildly guided her, and Lindi followed his advice.</p>
<p>She lived an honest and self-respecting life, but recently, Lu Rongbao learned that Lindi had renewed her affair and decided to investigate. The other day, he pretended that he needed to go out with his employer, and so he might not be home that night. At the same time, he instructed a friend to monitor Lindi's movements. Early in the morning, around eight o'clock, Lindi dressed up in gorgeous clothes and left the house, heading straight to Room 529 of the Nanjing Hotel at No. 200 Shanxi Road. After entering the room, she locked the door. Her husband's friend completely saw this activity and rushed to report to Rongbao. Around ten o'clock, he immediately reported to the General Inspectorate. Chinese Detective Zhang Mingde and detectives Tian Zhengsheng and Chi Shi, ordered a hotel employee to open the door. They found Lindi and a man lying naked in bed. They ordered them to get dressed and took them both back to the police station. The man said his name was Xi Jinfu, a 28-year-old Shanghai native who lives at No. 250, Lane 687, Maigen Road, and works as a clerk at the Shanghai Electric Power Company. Xi and Lu Lindi claimed that they had met in the street a month ago and had exchanged affectionate words, becoming acquainted with each other. Today was their first secret rendezvous. The detectives investigated at the Nanjing Hotel and learned that the room had been booked by Xi on the evening of the 14th. On the morning of the 15th, the woman arrived first around eight o'clock, and Xi arrived later around nine o'clock. This proves that this pair of lovebirds met by appointment, and yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Division of the Ninth Special District Court. The Inspectorate lawyer, Qian Xunfa, explained the situation and charged them with adultery under Article 239 of the criminal code. When questioned, Xi Jinfu claimed that although he had known Lu Lindi for about a month, they had only met once before at the Xihai Grand Theater to watch a movie. This was the first time they had had a relationship because they had few opportunities to meet, and therefore he didn't know much about the woman's situation. Lu also admitted that this was her first secret rendezvous with Xi. Lu Rongbao also engaged a lawyer who came to court and said that he was currently in reconciliation with Lu Lindi, so he requested permission to bail Lindi, but that he would continue to sue Xi. The Inspectorate lawyer objected to the plaintiff's lawyer's request, saying that the accusation was also requested by the accuser. Permitting Lu Lindi's bail would also be at the request of the accuser. How can the Inspectorate be used as a tool for their negotiations, and treat the lawsuit as a joke? Therefore, he asked that the plaintiff's request be rejected. Judge Pan Zhenyang reviewed the case and ruled that the case be rescheduled for a further hearing. Both defendants were remanded in custody.</p>

<p>Dong Huichun, a 19-year-old Shaoxing native who worked as a tea boy at the Meicheng Printing Shop at No. 396 Wuzhou Road, had been working there for ten months. Recently, he had a sudden whim and secretly stole a blank check from the Zhejiang Industrial Bank and three checks from the Guoxin Bank from the cash box. Around ten o'clock on the morning of the 12th of this month, he filled out the Industrial Bank check for 2,000 yuan to withdraw money, but was unsuccessful because the seal was blurred. He immediately changed his plan and used a Guoxin Bank check, still filling it out for 2,000 yuan. At nine o'clock on the morning of the day before yesterday, when he went to the bank at No. 422 Hankou Road to withdraw the money, he was discovered by the manager of the Meicheng Printing Shop, who reported the situation to the Jiaxing Road police station. The police station sent Chinese detective Jin Yangwu to arrest the tea boy Dong and bring him back to the police station along with the filled-out check and two seals. He was taken into custody. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. The Municipal Council lawyer, Zhang Shizhu, explained the case and requested prosecution. Afterwards, Wu Zhongxian, the Shaoxing native manager of the Meicheng Printing Shop, and detective Jin reported the process of investigation. They presented the evidence for inspection. When questioned, the tea boy Dong admitted everything. Judge Xiao Xiefen sentenced Dong Huichun to two years imprisonment. The forged check was confiscated and the two seals were returned.</p>

<h3 id="e164">A Wonderful Scene from the Xiqing Basketball League: Xintong Defeats Mailing Class A: Both Sides Acted Elegantly, Courageously, Not Fiercely; Result: 33 to 23 <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Last night's Xiqing Basketball game between Xintong and Mailing Class A was quite eye-catching, as neither team had been defeated since their establishment. But under the battle, Mailing was dwarfed, and the game was almost entirely controlled by Xintong. The result was 32 to 23, and Xintong maintained its undefeated record. In another game, University beat Hujiang over Nanyang, 42 to 28.</p>
<p>Watching the performance of Xintong is worthy of being a championship team. The beauty of the connection made Mailing little chance to get the ball. Members like Shi Gui Ya and Lan Jin have their roles, and Carson's central dispatch is the soul of the team.</p>
<p>The Mailing team had no connection, inaccurate passing, and no grasp of the shot. So far, the first round has been completely over. The only team that is good enough to fight Xintong is Jinan.</p>
<p>In last night's battle, both sides acted clearly and elegantly, winning by their skills. The battle was brave but not fierce, fast but not anxious, and worthy of being a masterpiece. The first half was 20 to 13, and the overall result was 33 to 23.</p>

<p>Only Aikoku, Qixiu, and Chongde participated in this year’s National Athletic Federation Women's Basketball Championship.

According to the association's regulations, a championship will not be held if only two schools participate, and the competition will instead be an exhibition match. Therefore, this year's competition between Chongde and Qixiu will follow the precedent and be an exhibition match. However, the date has not yet been determined and will likely be after the Tiecheng Cup basketball tournament concludes.</p>

<p>Soochow University: Soochow University issued a telegram stating: "Recently, the border wars have been progressing, and it is hoped that the country's power can be strengthened and the national crisis can be alleviated. The whole country should unite as one to demonstrate the true strength of the nation. Unexpectedly, changes have occurred in Xi'an in recent days, holding the commander-in-chief hostage and claiming troops without authorization, inciting internal strife and benefiting external enemies. Even the most foolish person would not be so misguided. Our colleagues at the school are filled with righteous indignation and deep pain. Considering that forbearance is enough to serve the country and that division will lead to destruction, in addition to telegraphing the National Government to launch a swift attack, we respectfully request that all circles unanimously condemn this act to preserve the nation's lifeline and avert national peril. We earnestly hope for this. All faculty, staff, and students of Jiangsu Private Soochow University and Soochow High School respectfully kowtow."</p>
<p>Universities in Zhejiang Province: Zhejiang University and other schools telegraphed Zhang Xueliang, urging him to escort Chairman Chiang Kai-shek back to Nanjing immediately, stating: "Addressed to all newspaper offices nationwide: We recently sent a telegram to Mr. Zhang Aoqing of Xi'an, which stated: 'Chiang Kai-shek is the mainstay of the nation, and the people rely on him. Recently, we heard that you detained him in western Shaanxi, causing shock throughout the country, and rumors are rampant, making it difficult to fathom. We believe that you, having served at home and abroad for a long time and managed military affairs, must share the desire to save the nation, which is facing great difficulties. How can you gamble the nation's fate on a single throw? At a time when the entire country is celebrating unification and the government's measures are in line with public sentiment, and the victory in Suiyuan is widely praised, all actions should be carefully considered in light of the people's wishes and the current environment. Do not be swayed by momentary emotions and be forever condemned by the nation and future generations. We hope that you will exercise your wisdom, pull back from the brink, and immediately escort Chairman Chiang Kai-shek back to Nanjing to preserve the nation's lifeline and avoid becoming a sinner of the Republic of China. We urge you to consider this carefully. With urgent telegrams, we await your instructions.' National Zhejiang University, National College of Art, and Jiangnan College of Liberal Arts and Zhejiang Provincial School of Medicine respectfully express their concern."</p>
<p>China Education Society: The China Education Society telegraphed Zhang Xueliang, stating: "To Mr. Zhang Hanqing of Xi'an: News reports indicate that you used troops to hold Chairman Chiang Kai-shek hostage and made unwarranted demands. At a time when unification has just been achieved and the country is urgently facing incursions from bandits, it is necessary for the whole country to be of one mind and pool resources to resist the enemy and defend the country to strengthen national prestige. Chairman Chiang has dedicated himself to the safety of the nation, spending years running around and planning meritorious deeds. Unexpectedly, you mistakenly believed in conspiracies and harbored malicious intentions, causing this extraordinary change, creating chaos, and shaking the foundation of the nation. Even if personal success or failure is not worth mentioning, what about the credibility of our Chinese nation? No national affairs can be more reckless and absurd than this. We urge you to take a broad view and consider carefully, placing the lives of the entire nation above all else, change your plans immediately, and send capable personnel to escort Chairman Chiang Kai-shek back to Nanjing to preside over the central government's plans. All demands can be presented, and the masses will follow or reject them. This is where the interests of the nation and the people lie. We hope you will handle this well. China Education Society respectfully urges."</p>

<h3 id="e180">Hubei Province's Literacy Campaign Implements Six-Year Plan, Establishing 70,000 People's Schools to Educate Over 20 Million Illiterates, Adopting Tutorial System and Civic Training Outside of People's Schools <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Wuhan Correspondence: Education in Hubei Province is backward, and it is even more difficult to popularize in rural areas. According to government statistics, among the province's over 30 million people, there are more than 17 million and 76 thousand and 4353 illiterates, and in reality, the number is definitely higher. Implementing universal education is intended for the entire population, with the purpose of training the general public in the ethics and discipline that should be followed in public and private life, and providing the knowledge and skills necessary for daily life. The meaning is very important. However, because the age of the educated varies, the teaching methods are different, so there are divisions of compulsory education, literacy education, and civic training. In order to complete universal education, the Department of Education has decided to implement a supplementary education plan for out-of-school people starting this year, to eliminate illiteracy in the province within six years. The main points are to organize a provincial universal education committee as the general organization for promoting and implementing supplementary education for out-of-school people in the province. The provincial capital and various counties and cities will also form sub-committees. The methods are: (1) To widely establish people's schools. All out-of-school people who exceed the age of compulsory education must enter people's schools for supplementary education. However, priority should be given to men and women aged sixteen to thirty-five, and then extended to older and younger people. (2) Adopt a tutorial system. The tutorial system should continue to be promoted in areas where it has been effective to supplement what people's schools cannot cover. (3) Implement civic training. It should be promoted first in the provincial capital and prosperous towns, and every Sunday should be designated as training time. The implementation of the above three methods should strive for mutual connection. Regarding people's schools, there are two types: single-established and affiliated. Single-established people's schools adopt a half-day, two-part system, with each school having two classes. Affiliated people's schools belong to organizations and groups, each with one or two classes; those belonging to schools have one class for every two existing grades, and those with only one class must also add a class. Each class is limited to 50 students. Single-established schools have three hours of teaching per day, or two hours. Affiliated schools have two hours of teaching per day. Those established in rural areas should avoid the farming season. The length of study, calculated by the amount of teaching time, should not be less than 200 hours. The provincial capital and various counties and cities take the Bao-Jia area as the unit for implementing supplementary education for out-of-school people, to be completed in phases from August of the 15th year of the Republic of China (1926) to July of the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932). In the first year (August of the 25th year to July of the 26th year), the city of Hankou will establish 400 classes of people's schools, the provincial capital will establish 120 classes of people's schools, and the counties will establish a total of 4,200 classes of people's schools. In the second year (August of the 26th year to July of the 27th year), the city of Hankou will establish 600 classes of people's schools, the provincial capital will establish 200 classes of people's schools, and the counties will establish a total of 7,000 classes of people's schools. In the third year (August of the 27th year to July of the 28th year), the city of Hankou will establish 800 classes of people's schools, the provincial capital will establish 280 classes of people's schools, and the counties will establish a total of 9,800 classes of people's schools. In the fourth year (August of the 28th year to July of the 29th year), the city of Hankou will establish 1,000 classes of people's schools, the provincial capital will establish 360 classes of people's schools, and the counties will establish 12,600 classes of people's schools. In the fifth year (August of the 29th year to July of the 30th year), the city of Hankou will establish 1,200 classes of people's schools, the provincial capital will establish 440 classes of people's schools, and the counties will establish 15,400 classes of people's schools. In the sixth year (August of the 30th year to July of the 21st year), the city of Hankou will establish 1,400 classes of people's schools, the provincial capital will establish 520 classes of people's schools, and the counties will establish 74,520 classes of people's schools. Each class will run at least two terms per year. Together with the students of the tutorial and vocational education programs, over 800,000 people can be taught. At the same time, people with better achievements in universal education will be required to take on the role of teaching. It is expected that the illiteracy of the province will gradually be eliminated within the six-year period.</p>

<h3 id="e192">Finance: Speculative Giants Suppress Prices at High Levels; Lower by $1.60 Compared to Previous Close; Down Over $4 If Combined With Deferred Delivery <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>The gold market formally entered its February period yesterday. The market opened in a continued bullish trend, and the spot market also showed strong momentum. However, speculative giants took advantage of the high prices to constantly suppress the market, triggering selling, and ultimately leading to a decline. Early in the morning, news came from overseas that both the London bar and the New York silver market had shrunk. Monteiro forward silver prices rose by half a basket to three baskets. London bullion remained unchanged, and exchange rates rose slightly. The Central Bank's official exchange rates were announced, with both British and American currencies unchanged. The customs gold unit remained unchanged. The official price of standard gold bars was still listed at 1152.7 yuan. Pre-market trading opened outside the market at around 62 yuan. Fuxing, Yongqing, Fayong, Wanxing, and Dacheng all placed orders, gradually rising to over 4 yuan. Although the morning opening was high, the actual opening was lackluster when combined with deferred delivery. After the opening, the Dalian gang and others continued to place orders and the price continued to rise. However, speculative giants took advantage of the high prices to add to their short positions, and many long positions also sold off. The HSBC's official exchange rates were announced, with both British and American currencies unchanged. Many retail investors also added to their short positions, and the market could not hold, gradually moving downstream. However, because many short positions saw lower prices and continued to cover, the spot market was particularly strong, and the exchange rate remained stable. Although there was a rebound, ultimately, speculative giants suppressed prices at high levels, and many long positions sold off. The silver equalization tax was announced, down a little bit, and prices fell steadily. Although there was much struggle in the middle, the overall trend was difficult to be optimistic about. Later, because there were many buyers active after the lower prices, the market turned to hover at noon. The deferred delivery was offered by long positions at around 2.5 yuan. The following is a record of the market situation for the first half of the day.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the public bond market fluctuated more and more violently. The market opened with a tight environment, and the firmness turned into a sudden leap. Market rumors changed from time to time, and people's hearts became more and more flustered. In and out of the market were also quite chaotic. Most large investors sold after the market price rose, so the market price rose and fell quite inconsistently. However, towards the end of the market, as the news published in the evening paper changed, sellers became more and more enthusiastic, and the market price fell sharply. Yesterday morning's opening was full of trepidation, and the market situation also turned weak. Large investors in the 35th and 18th issues sold off, and the market price unanimously fell 34 jiao to 8 jiao. However, the 47th and 11th issues bought a lot. Class B and Unified Class A rose 1 jiao this month. In the second session, large long investors absorbed again, and the market recovered.

In the Ding issue, the 10th, 5th, and 54th issues started to sell off, and the market price fell unanimously by 4 jiao to 6 jiao.

After that, the 54th, 5th, and 11th issues also sold off, and the market price fell by 45 jiao to 1 yuan. The closing result was a sharp drop of 50 cents to over 1 yuan. The total number of transactions was 23.62 million yuan. The following is a comparison of the rise and fall and the high and low prices in a table (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3 id="e195">Yarn and Cotton: Cotton Yarn's Rising Trend is Frustrated, But the Result is Not Much Different; Third-Grade Yarn Plummets by 5 Yuan <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>After the continuous sharp rise in the yarn market, profiteers emerged, and the news eased, and the market situation was slightly flat. Moreover, it has risen sharply by 17 or 8 yuan in the past two days, and a certain degree of pullback is also expected. Osaka's third-grade yarn also moved against the trend yesterday, falling by 5.2 yuan. Current yarn transactions are also affected due to high prices. However, a certain long-side's absorbed amount has not been completely abandoned, and a certain cotton company has settled half of its long positions.</p>
<p>Long-Term Contracts Still Unchanged</p>
<p>The opening of the bidding yarn market still showed a rise in each month, and the momentum was still tight, because the long-side's pulling force was very strong. The second session suddenly fell by 2 yuan this month, and the long-term contracts also followed the decline. The market state changed suddenly when the third session opened for bidding. Floating words arose, saying that a certain cotton industry organization would have news of closure, and the news of a large amount of liquidation and the rebound of public bonds had improved. The selling trend suddenly rose, and the one-month contract plummeted by 2.5 yuan, and the decline in the long-term contracts was slightly behind. Until the close, it was heard that there were still 600 bales of current yarn transactions, and a certain long side came to pull up again, and rebounded by 2.5 yuan. As a result, this month fell 2.9 yuan compared with the previous day's closing price, and the long-term contracts did not move. The afternoon opening rose by 2.9 yuan this month, and the long-term contracts fell back, but it was still calm after entering the market. Only the third-grade yarn plummeted by 5.2 yuan, and the market state at the close was slightly flat. As a result, this month rose 2 yuan compared with the morning closing price, and the long-term contracts were flat. The statistics of the number of sold bales are as follows: Yudai 7,000 bales, Dafu 900 bales, Taichang 750 bales, Yichang 750 bales, Dachang 3,100 bales, Shengyuan 850 bales, Changyu 650 bales, and Hengde 750 bales.

<p>After the big rise in the cotton market, it fell back yesterday, because the US and Indian cotton markets unanimously fell back, and people's hearts turned to downstream. However, some cotton merchants' minds are still absorbing and not releasing, and the current cotton factory's needs are not very enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Recent Decline is Uniquely Severe</p>
<p>The opening of the bidding flower market was due to the decline in the US and Indian cotton markets, and the large investors unanimously went out of the market the previous day, causing the market to relax, and each month fell by 1.2 jiao. After the second session, the yarn market fell back, and the cotton market was even more depressed, forcing the market to rebound slightly until the close. As a result, each month fell by 1.2 jiao to 3.5 jiao compared with the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening was due to the news of the decline in the overseas cotton market, and the market was very tired. At the same time, the current cotton business was not smooth. As a result, each month rose and fell by 5 points to 1 jiao compared with the morning closing price. The statistics of the number of sold bales are as follows: Hengyi 10,800 dan, Juxing 3,100 dan, Taichang 2,100 dan, Changfeng 5,600 dan, Xinchang 5,000 dan, Yuanxingchang 7,800 dan, Changhe 14,700 dan, Taixing 4,900 dan, and Senkang 3,300 dan, Fuan 6,200 dan.

<p>Yesterday, US cotton opened, and each month fell by 2 pounds. It rose to 6 pounds. The December contract was weak due to 40 delivery notices. The distant months were firm due to purchases by foreign merchants, brokers, and peers. The May contract encountered resistance at 1.2 jiao and 3.5 cents. The market reversed due to long positions closing and cotton merchants covering sales. Current cotton was firm. Although many long positions closed at high prices, people's hearts were still stable. The closing was stable. The spot price fell by 11 cents, and the futures fell by 7 to 14 pounds. British cotton spot prices rose and fell by one point, and futures rose by three to five points. Indian cotton covered too much, and the market was tired due to replenishment and purchases by peers, and then long positions closed. Pingguoer fell by 0.5 to 0.75 rupees, Aomula fell by 0.75 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell by 1 rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram from the 15th).

<p>Yesterday's flour market presented an image of initial stability, then a decline, and finally stability again. Foreign wheat quotations, Chicago, pulled back 24 jiao, while Canada improved by 1.65 yuan, and Liverpool still improved by 1.5 yuan. When the gang opened the price, people's hearts were still stable. Then, with the hope of improvement in the situation, and the continued return of large long positions, the asking prices for each month gradually loosened, falling by about 35 points compared to the initial session. When the afternoon session opened, it was very flat at first, but later, the sales of customers were slightly more active, and the rumors about the situation tightened again, causing a surge in buying, and the market atmosphere stepped up again. In the current situation, because the changes in the situation are unpredictable, the future is really beyond grasp.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the wheat at the Jamaican market stopped bidding in the morning due to not paying supplements, and the market opened for trading in the afternoon, and the situation in each month was also chaotic. The first opening of this month was 7 yuan, but later, due to the withdrawal of our head, it fell by 78 points. January and February initially saw stability, but later, due to the instability of the flour market, people inside and outside the industry also acted at a loss, sometimes in and sometimes out, and although the transactions were positive, the market was messy. In March and April, because the buying was more active, the price was up to 7.42 yuan. Later, because many long positions sold out, the market also softened. This situation, I am afraid, is not temporary due to the unclear situation. The current wheat market sees poor delivery, and the whole market only opens for more than 1,000 bales, and the wheat price in Gaoyou Dongtai is 6.9 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e206">Investigation: Shanghai Commodity Price Index Rises <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>November, Year 25</p>
<p>According to the report of the National Tariff Hsiu-jih Association, in November of the 25th year, the Shanghai wholesale, export, and import commodity price indices, as well as the cost of living index, all rose compared to the previous month. The wholesale price increase was particularly high. (Cotton yarn, cotton cloth, wheat, and flour) all continued to rise in price due to brisk sales. (Raw silk, hardware) saw domestic selling prices rise in unison due to sharp increases overseas. This is the main reason for the rise in the index. The details are explained below:</p>
<p>Wholesale Commodity Price Index: The overall index was 113.0, an increase of 3.0% compared to July and 9.4% compared to the same month last year. All eight sub-indices showed increases compared to the previous month. The largest increase was in the (metals, building materials, pharmaceuticals, and textiles) category. The remaining categories did not exceed 2%. The metals category rose by 6.9%. Among the various items, except for (tinplate, black iron pipes, and sewing needles), which remained stable, all others rose. The most notable increase was in lead bars, which rose by 24%, due to recent price increases overseas and scarce inventory. The pharmaceuticals category rose by 5.3%. Douglas fir prices increased due to the American seamen's strike, which hindered supply. (Lime, black bricks, cement, and China fir) also rose by 7% to 14%. Textiles rose by 4.6%. Cotton cloth prices continued to rise due to strong sales, with printed calico rising by 20% and (fine cloth, fine twill, cotton drill) rising by more than 10%. Cotton yarn prices rose by 7% to 10%, reaching the highest price since the second half of the year, due to large purchases from "Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Tianjin, and Guangdong," and spinning mills were working overtime, yet supply still could not meet demand, and local Japanese factories also experienced a labor strike at this time. However, cotton prices remained stable at the same time, and the cotton spinning industry, which had been in difficulty for a long time, showed signs of turning around, with yarn prices high and cotton prices low. In other instances, dried cocoons rose sharply due to extreme scarcity of spot goods, and white silk rose sharply due to external markets. (Woolen cloth, velvet, silk, satin) markets were also firm.</p>
<p>Export Commodity Price Index: The overall index was 97.1, an increase of 1.0% compared to the previous month and 8.4% compared to the same month last year. All three sub-indices showed increases compared to July. Raw materials increased more, while consumer goods and raw material products increased less. Raw materials increased by 2.5%. White silk prices rose sharply in unison in European and American markets. According to the New York price of Shanghai white silk on the 14th of this month compared to the 15th of last month, the price per pound rose from US$1.63 to US$1.83. The trend in the French and British silk markets was the same. Furthermore, the price of cocoons rose sharply due to the poor autumn cocoon harvest domestically, and costs increased, and the local selling price per dan rose from 740 yuan last month to 830 yuan this month. Cotton yarn and asphalt prices also tended to rise. However, tung oil prices fell as new supplies gradually increased, sales of raw oil were sluggish, and soybean oil prices declined in the Lian market. Otherwise, the rate of increase in this category would not have been limited to this. Consumer goods rose by 1.0%. Hog fat prices rose sharply due to shortages. Egg prices were firm and rising, along with coarse cloth and flour, etc. Raw material products rose by 0.4%. Pig iron, pure antimony, and dried cocoons rose by more than 10% due to shortages of inventory, and tin ingots rose due to overseas price increases. Hog bristles, waste silk, and China fir all rose. As a result, the animal products, forestry products, and mineral products indices in this category all rose. However, the abundant production of soybeans, a major export, fell along with the Lian market, and raw kernels arrived in abundance, with sluggish sales, and green beans and cottonseed cake also tended to fall, so the index was lower than the previous month, and the rising trend of the raw material products index was also softened as a result.

<h3 id="e207">Waistcoat Woolen Overcoats Still in Vogue <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Woolen overcoats, especially those with lining, are most popular. They are not only light and easy to wear, but also last a long time. Therefore, most men's overcoats nowadays abandon thick wool and are made with lining. This trend has been prevalent for twelve or thirteen years. At that time, the material used was riding breeches wool, with No. 1005 being the best. Initially, it sold for eight taels and five qian of silver per yard. Later, the supply increased annually, and No. 2 and No. 3 goods were imported. Japanese goods were also spun, flooding the Chinese market. Western clothing stores in the Da Xin Street area resumed advertising, and the sales of riding breeches woolen overcoats became increasingly prosperous. Later, due to too many orders for No. 1005, and inconsistent quality, Kong Shi Foreign Firm changed it to No. 100. Other merchants changed it to No. 1009. As a result, the good ones are now called "Old No. 1005," and the inferior ones are called "New No. 1005." After the abolition of the tael and the adoption of the yuan, domestic Zhanghua products were produced, and imports of both domestic and foreign goods continued to increase, causing prices to gradually decline with the environment. By 1931, customers had largely become tired of riding breeches woolen overcoats. Keqiding suddenly rose in popularity, but still could not replace them. Last year, Zhan Luoding lined overcoats became newly popular, and this year even more so, but they are still difficult to defeat riding breeches wool, because most Keqiding are Japanese goods, and the price is difficult to reduce, but they lose their shape quickly after wearing. Furthermore, Ding tends to shed gray fuzz, while riding breeches wool does not have the above-mentioned common problems, so it has always been popular. The domestic Zhanghua brand’s Yihe riding breeches wool is suitable, with low prices and cheaper imports, and the quality is also solid.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the overseas silk market was relatively stable. New York and Lyon silk prices remained at the previous day's levels. New York spot prices rose by one point, and futures rose by three and a half points. Yokohama spot and futures each rose by ten yuan. The market sentiment was quite strong for a time. Shanghai's silk market is also gradually opening up for sales. White Factory B-grade 20/22 strips sold for 725 yuan yesterday, showing considerable improvement compared to the previous day. In terms of users, only Hangzhou merchants traded, and prices also rose slightly, but unfortunately, there were not many transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Red and Green Tea Domestic Sales Slightly Active <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the tea market has been very sluggish for foreign firms. European and American firms believe that the goods on the market are scarce and do not meet sales tastes. In addition, the winter solstice is approaching, so they are mostly taking a wait-and-see attitude. However, domestic sales of fine Xiu Mei and Fu Xi grades have gradually improved. Gangdong, Guangdong and Shantou merchants are rushing to purchase 700-odd boxes in Shanghai daily, with prices opening at twelve or thirteen yuan. It is reported that the Wulong black tea from old Jia Tai Yu Xin Long and other tea houses has shipped four or five hundred boxes due to replenishment messages from Tianjin.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Sugar Market New Tide Green Continues to Fall by Four or Five Jiao <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was stable. The association's benchmark price for 24 coarse sand white spot goods was 21 yuan and 6 jiao. The transshipment of high-quality goods was 6 yuan and 2 jiao and 2 fen, with transactions already made. Among the Dongbai, only the spot goods of the SH mark were priced at 21 yuan and 2 jiao and a half, and were also allocated. The remaining items lack further news. The staple cotton red silk remained unchanged. The Hao grade goods had Chaozhou merchants selling over a hundred packages of new tide , but the selling was slack. In addition, sales in the north were sluggish, and suddenly fell by four or five jiao. It is heard that the trend of fourteen yuan two jiao and two fen is still difficult to reverse.</p>
<p>Forming a Joint Company, yesterday was the second bidding period for Guangdong sugar in this city. The total quota was over ten thousand packages. The bid price was the same as before. It sold 740 packages of Shunde Factory’s Five Rams coarse white sugar at twenty-one yuan and two jiao, and 415 and 200 packages of the City New Factory at twenty yuan and seven jiao.</p>

<p>Recently, the sales of Longkou vermicelli have been slightly weak, and the market supply has slightly loosened. Yesterday (September 2nd), the higher-priced goods sold for twenty-five yuan, and the second-grade goods sold for twenty-four yuan and a half. However, the customer supply still insists and refuses to show weakness. High-quality goods are priced at twenty-one yuan, and the production price is still firm, showing signs that it is difficult to relax temporarily.</p>

<p>Since the overseas price of ribbed steel bars has returned from five pounds twelve shillings to six pounds nine shillings, the local industry in this city has still been recklessly purchasing them, so the trading is extremely good. Yesterday, the overseas price suddenly rose to seven pounds eighteen shillings, which is one pound and nine shillings better than before. However, the industry believes that the price is too high and is afraid that it will be difficult to sell in the future, so most are taking a wait-and-see attitude, so the trading is slightly clearer than before. However, the market price in this city yesterday was as high as 160 yuan due to the soaring overseas prices. It is heard that there are only sporadic transactions.</p>

<p>— Zhang Shuying</p>
<p>— Inventor of the Submarine</p>
<p>The submarine is the most important weapon in modern scientific warfare. Its importance in war is equal to that of airplanes. We only need to look at the disputes over the increase, decrease, and abandonment of submarines in the major powers' disarmament conferences to understand how important the submarine is.</p>
<p>Given the current completeness of submarine equipment in various countries and the large number of submarines, some people must suspect that the invention of the submarine must have been very early and its history very long. In fact, the complete success of the submarine was only twenty or thirty years ago, that is, a few years before the European War. Even the initial research on submarines and the invention of manufacturing models were only a century ago. It is unbelievable that scientists have produced modern and very complete submarines after only a few decades of effort. Although submarines are weapons of war and disrupt world peace, the completeness of their creation and their great contribution to science are truly amazing. Therefore, we should not only understand the process of inventing submarines and the great men who invented them, but also admire them very much. Holland is such a person worthy of our admiration. With his patriotism and indomitable spirit, he finally succeeded despite several failures.</p>
<p>Holland was born in Ireland, England, in 1841. His family was well-off, and he received a full education from an early age. Later, he became a teacher at a monastery in Ireland. Whenever he had free time in the monastery, he devoted himself to researching submarines. At this time, the American Civil War happened to occur. He was greatly interested in and hopeful for the future when John Ericsson (1802-1880) built ironclad vehicles for the Northern Army to participate in the war and won the victory.</p>
<p>Holland's hope was for his homeland, Ireland, to break away from British rule and become a completely independent country. However, the British's powerful navy at the time was the biggest obstacle to achieving this. Now that Ericsson had invented ironclad warships, Ireland's independence could only become a dream with no hope of success. Since Holland had such a great hope to work for the independence of his country, the first thing he had to do was invent something that could contain the advance of the navy and was lower than ironclad warships. This was the biggest motivation for studying and manufacturing submarines. He thought that if submarines could dive into the water, they would definitely be able to break through enemy warships without the enemy's knowledge and win the war.</p>
<p>After Holland had this motivation to invent submarines, he devoted himself to studying the manufacture of submarines and the results of previous research. He learned from books that the first person to make a submarine model was the Dutchman Cornelis Von Prebbel (1742-1826); later, during the American Revolutionary War, the American Danid Bushnell (1742-1826) made a more complete submarine. This type of submarine only had one sailor, and it used manpower to dive into the water and could last for half an hour, but the experiment of attacking a British warship anchored in New York Harbor failed. It can be seen that the manufacturing was extremely simple and the mechanism was not perfect, so it could not be used.</p>
<p>The second person to study submarines was Robert Fulton (1765-1815), the inventor of the steamboat. He initially proposed to the US government to manufacture submarines, but it was not approved. Later, he proposed it abroad, but because he was not trusted, it did not attract people's attention or permission. However, he did not have the strength to manufacture it himself, so he gave up on submarines in disappointment.</p>
<p>Later, during the American Civil War, submarines were manufactured, and the Southern Army's submarine sank the Northern Army's battleship, but the structure was extremely simple and not very applicable.</p>
<p>Seeing that these predecessors had not achieved complete success in the manufacture and research of submarines, Holland was determined to become the person who completed the submarine. He went to the United States at the age of seventeen and landed in Boston. Unfortunately, this ambitious young man contracted a chronic illness soon after arriving in this new continent. The doctor wanted him to rest in the hospital for a long time. Unexpectedly, he got the opportunity to devote himself to studying submarines and came up with various methods for manufacturing submarines.</p>
<p>In 1875, when Holland was thirty-five years old, he initially made a very small submarine, but because the manufacturing was not yet complete, it was placed on the water and suddenly plunged into the mud, destroying the entire submarine. This submarine was cigar-shaped, sixteen feet long, and two feet wide in the center. The person sat in the center of the submarine and started the propulsion engine to move forward. It was named Holland No. 1. After the failure of No. 1, he was not discouraged and continued to manufacture No. 2, but because No. 2 was not improved, it followed the same path. After two failures, Holland had more and more experience. He was more confident that he would be able to complete this great mission, so he continued to work hard on research. Because he was engaged in Irish independence movement while researching, and the submarine he was researching was a tool to achieve the goal of independence, it was easy to obtain tens of thousands of dollars for his research, so he quickly manufactured two more submarines.</p>
<p>Holland's submarine was very different from those made by his predecessors. In the past, it took at least several minutes to completely flood, but Holland's could enter the depths of the water in just a few seconds and could move freely in the water. After Holland No. 3 and No. 4 were produced, he had achieved considerable success in his research on submarines. He then resigned from his teaching position and devoted all his efforts to researching more perfect submarines.</p>
<p>In 1888, Holland finally obtained the approval of the US Prime Minister to allow the US Navy to adopt submarines. Unfortunately, a political change in Washington occurred shortly after this permission, and it could not be implemented. By 1893, the US Department of the Navy accepted his opinion again and manufactured the Brandle submarine, but because the Washington government's technicians disagreed with some of Holland's designs, the ending was inevitably a failure. Holland was very angry and resentfully returned the government's nine thousand dollar price, took back the submarine, and then manufactured a new ship according to his own design, named "Holland." This Holland was the first modern submarine, 53 feet 10 inches long and 10 feet 7 inches deep. Shortly after this submarine was produced, war broke out between the United States and Spain, but the conservative US government was still unwilling to use the new weapon submarine as a tool to sink enemy ships.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1900, the US government gradually realized the great ability of submarines and began to buy the "Holland" submarine and ordered six similar Holland submarines from Holland. After a large exercise, the naval officers admired the power of the submarine very much. At this time, Holland had received great glory, and from then on, the navies of other countries also rushed to adopt submarines.</p>
<p>On September 22, 1914, a submarine sank several British battleships, which was exactly one month and ten days after the death of the great inventor of submarines, Holland.</p>

<p>— Su Zihan</p>
<p>—Heroes Would Rather Die Than Be Humiliated—</p>
<p>Since the Jin army broke through Bianjing and captured Emperors Huizong and Qinzong, and established the great traitor Zhang Zongchang as emperor, the Song dynasty's empire was almost over. Fortunately, Emperor Gaozong escaped from the Jin camp, crossed the Yellow River, and ascended the throne in Nanjing. The loyalist troops and righteous men from all over the country arrived in Nanjing, and finally preserved the southern half of the empire.</p>
<p>Now that the foundation had been established, troops should have been mobilized to cross the Yellow River and fight the Jin army desperately to recover the lost territory and wash away the national shame. Unexpectedly, Gaozong did not do this, and listened to the words of ministers who only cared about enjoying wealth and glory and did not care about national affairs. He stayed in the south as emperor, and did not take the recovery of lost territory and the washing away of national shame seriously. As a result, the loyal and righteous Zong Ze, the garrison commander of Tokyo, was worried to death. When Commander Zong was dying, he still shouted "Cross the river!" It is a pity that Gaozong could not reuse such a bloody, courageous, loyal, and righteous minister.</p>
<p>Although Gaozong was enjoying himself in the south, the Jin army would never let him go. When the autumn was high and the grass was fat, and the people were strong and the horses were strong, they sent troops again, mighty and majestic, to kill south. At that time, among the generals guarding the Yellow River passes, there were two more traitors who betrayed the country for glory and surrendered the passes. Du Chong, Zong Ze's successor, was also a guy who only knew himself and did not know the country. Seeing the Jin army's power, he also surrendered. As a result, from the south of the Yellow River to the north bank of the Yangtze River, there was no place without Jin soldiers, and no place was not harassed by Jin soldiers.</p>
<p>At that time, Gaozong was in Pingjiang. Since the Jin army had come, he should have rushed to Nanjing to mobilize troops and generals to fight the Jin army. The Yangtze River was a natural barrier that the Jin army could not fly over even with wings. Even if they could not win, they could still defend it! Unfortunately, Gaozong did not do this, but listened to the words of useless guys like Huang Qianren and Wang Boyan. As soon as the Jin army broke through Yangzhou, he abandoned Pingjiang and ran madly to Hangzhou. Then he could not even defend Hangzhou and ran all the way to Mingzhou and entered the sea, which was considered to be settled.</p>
<p>In this way, the Jin army got what they wanted. Without any effort, they crossed the Yangtze River, broke through Nanjing, broke through Pingjiang, and followed Gaozong all the way to the sea before stopping. However, the people on the coast suffered a disaster. If Gaozong had not abandoned Pingjiang and relied on the natural barrier of the Yangtze River to fight the Jin army, the Jin army might not have gained an advantage, and might have even suffered a complete defeat.</p>
<p>Let's stop here. Although the officials were such failures, there were many ambitious, loyal, and righteous people among the common people who were unwilling to be slaves of a conquered country.</p>
<p>It is said that at that time, there were two common people in Pingjiang, one surnamed Liu, named Nain, and one surnamed Zhang, named Ao. These two friends were both from Bianjing. Because Bianjing was broken and Zhang Zongchang betrayed the country, his two friends were so angry that they had no power and could not do anything, so they had to complain to heaven and earth. Later, they heard that Gaozong had ascended the throne in Nanjing, and the two friends were extremely happy. They gathered together to discuss going to the south together. Fortunately, Zhang Ao had no family, and Liu Nai only had a wife, so it was not troublesome to leave.</p>
<p>After arriving in the south, Liu Nai and Zhang Ao settled in Pingjiang, and each found a small business to make a living.</p>
<p>After Gaozong arrived in Pingjiang, Pingjiang became lively and had a peaceful appearance. Everyone lived peacefully. Unexpectedly, the Jin army's ambition was not satisfied, and they raised troops again to seize the empire of China. The news became worse day by day, and everyone's good dreams were shattered.</p>
<p>When Liu Nai heard the news that the Jin army was coming again, he went to Zhang Ao and said, "I heard bad news that the Jin army is coming again, and they have crossed the Yellow River, broken through Bianjing, and Du Chong, that dog's bastard, has also surrendered! Brother, do you know?"</p>
<p>Zhang Ao replied, "Brother, I knew it long ago. This time, the emperor should send troops to fight the Jin army and defeat them completely. Not only should we take back Bianjing, but we should also take back the land north of the Yellow River to be worthy of the people and our ancestors!"</p>
<p>Liu Nai said, "That's hard to say. Think about it, Lord Yue is currently suppressing bandits in Huguang, and General Han and others are also in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. What good generals does the emperor have around him? He only has those useless guys like Huang Qianren and Wang Boyan left. Do they have the courage to fight the Jin army desperately? Brother, what do you say?"</p>
<p>Zhang Ao said, "The emperor was able to escape from the Jin camp and run to the south alone to create a foundation. This courage and insight are not small. He should not run away as soon as he hears that the Jin army is coming, just like a mouse hears a cat meowing, without even seeing a shadow. Let's wait and see."</p>
<p>Liu Nai said, "Yes! Let's wait and see. Fortunately, my mind has long been made up. This life will sooner or later be spent fighting the Jin army."</p>
<p>Zhang Ao said, "Yes, it's natural to fight desperately when the time comes."</p>
<p>When the two friends had nothing to say, they parted.</p>
<p>After the Jin army broke through Yangzhou, the people of Pingjiang knew about the bad news, but they were still calm and not panicked at all. Originally, Yangzhou was still far from Pingjiang, and there was also a Yangtze River separating them! Unexpectedly, the officials could not calm down and slipped away to Hangzhou early.</p>
<p>Once the officials slipped away, it was really over. The people were all thinking, "Once the officials leave, it's clear that they don't want Pingjiang anymore, and the Jin army will naturally occupy Pingjiang. The Jin army is coming, what should we do?"</p>
<p>The streets were full of people, coming and going, panicking, all looking for friends and relatives, trying to discuss a good policy for the whole world.</p>
<p>Liu Nai also found Zhang Ao. As soon as they met, Liu Nai grabbed Zhang Ao's hand and shouted, "Brother, how was what I said? Those dog bastards are not fooling the emperor into running away, are they? They are really not something!"</p>
<p>Zhang Ao also shouted, "Such an emperor, he will run! He doesn't want the country, he doesn't want the land, he doesn't want the people, I really can't imagine it! Brother, now is the time!"</p>
<p>Liu Nai said: "That's right, now is the time, it's time for us to repay the country!"</p>
<p>Zhang Ao said, "However, brother, you have a sister-in-law!"</p>
<p>Liu Nai said, "Brother, don't say that, what time is it now, how can we care so much? Brother, your sister-in-law is also an understanding person. I said to her: 'For our country, for our nation, I am going to fight the Jin army. You are young, and you have no children. Take another step, don't remember me'! You opened your eyes and said: 'You can fight desperately. Don't squeeze me with words. Look at me.' Saying that, she turned around and left, ha! Brother, she wiped her neck and died! She died well! She is a good citizen of Great Song, and a good wife of my Liu Nai..."</p>
<p>Zhang Ao continued, "She is my Zhang Ao's good sister-in-law!"</p>
<p>Liu Nai said, "There must be more than just you and me who want to fight desperately, brother, let's go to the street and invite people!"</p>
<p>Zhang Ao said: "Good".</p>
<p>The two friends had already arrived on the street. The street was still so chaotic, and some were still carrying boxes and packages, preparing to escape.</p>
<p>Liu Nai shouted, "Don't go! You can't go!"</p>
<p>Someone replied: "If you don't go, are you waiting for the Jin army to come and cut off your head?"</p>
<p>Liu Nai shouted, "It's not like that, if you go, won't the Jin army follow? You still can't save your head. Now the officials don't want Pingjiang anymore, but we people want it, this is the land of Great Song! If we unite and fight the Jin army desperately, won't we protect Pingjiang and protect our families and wives and children? Don't go! Instead of dying if you leave, it's better to die happily fighting the Jin army!"</p>
<p>Zhang Ao also shouted, "It's the same as dying as a slave of a conquered country, it's also dying if you fight desperately, so it's more fun to die like this! Killing one person is enough, killing two people makes money!"</p>
<p>Shouting is shouting, but those who leave still leave. Let's stop here, is there really no one with hot blood? No, there are many people with hot blood. Look! Two or three hundred young people have jumped out of the crowd, shouting in unison: "Good man! I am willing to go with the two good men to fight the Jin army!"</p>
<p>Liu Nai shouted, "Good! We are people of Great Song when we are born, and ghosts of Great Song when we die. Let the Jin army taste the taste of our spear tips and knife heads."</p>
<p>Everyone also shouted: "Good! Heroes lead the way, we will find the Jin army to fight! Let's fight!"</p>
<p>A shout shook the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p>The Jin army came really fast.</p>
<p>After the Jin army broke through Yangzhou, they easily crossed the Yangtze River and captured Nanjing. No one resisted them along the way. They killed them mightily and majestically, and arrived in Pingjiang in a few days.</p>
<p>The Jin army had just arrived in Pingjiang, and there was still no news, when a team of warriors suddenly poured out of Panmen; at the head were Liu Nai and Zhang Ao. The two friends each held a death spear, and without saying a word, led the team of warriors into the Jin army's camp.</p>
<p>The Jin army was caught off guard and was disrupted by this team of mad tigers. Later, they realized that there were only a few people, so they surrounded them and fought. Liu Nai and Zhang Ao led everyone to charge left and right in the camp, killing so many people that corpses lay everywhere and blood flowed into rivers. The Jin army died a lot, but unfortunately, they were outnumbered. The people under their command gradually died, and Liu Nai also died in battle.</p>
<p>Seeing that the matter could not be successful, Zhang Ao thought: "Is it possible to have them take them away and be humiliated? It's better to die." Zhang Ao made up his mind, and while killing, he retreated, killing to the moat, and jumped into the moat and died.</p>
<p>The Jin army died thousands of people before they captured Pingjiang.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the people of Pingjiang admired the loyalty and righteousness of the two friends Liu Nai and Zhang Ao, and built a Shuangzhong Temple outside Lingyan Township in Panmen to commemorate them.</p>

<h3 id="e215">"Educational Broadcasting Lecture Collection" <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Bin</p>
<p>Volume 1: Public Education</p>
<p>The first volume of "Educational Broadcasting Lecture Collection" (Public Education) and the volume of "Educational Broadcasting Lecture Collection" (Secondary Education) were edited by the Ministry of Education and published by The Commercial Press at the same time. The latter has already been introduced by the author, so here, let's just talk about the former. This collection is divided into four categories in terms of editing: Citizenship Training; Scientific Knowledge; Current Affairs Lectures; Mandarin Training. A total of twenty-nine speeches are included. First, let's talk about the allocation of materials. Judging from the amount of material in each category, this collection can be considered just right. The Citizenship Training category includes nine speeches, the Scientific Knowledge category includes fourteen speeches, the Current Affairs Lectures category includes five speeches, and the Mandarin Training category includes one speech: the allocation of materials is very appropriate in terms of emphasis.</p>
<p>However, in terms of the types of materials, this collection still has shortcomings and omissions. For example, in the Citizenship Training category, there is a type of training that is urgently needed at present, but it has not been included, and that is citizenship training during the national defense period. Any speeches that explain the environment and crisis our country is currently in can be included in the Current Affairs Lectures category; any speeches that explain the awareness and duties that citizens should have during the national defense period can be included in the Citizenship Training category; any speeches that introduce scientific knowledge related to national defense can be included in the Scientific Knowledge category. However, this collection has not paid attention to this aspect of the material. This, of course, cannot be the responsibility of the editors, but should be the responsibility of the organizers of the educational broadcasting lectures.</p>
<p>Also, for the Citizenship Training category, some articles about the cultivation of employment, career, and job seeking should be collected; for the Scientific Knowledge category, some lectures about common sense of classified occupations should be added. However, this collection has not paid attention to these materials. In addition, there are some necessary materials, such as lectures about public art education and training, that have not been noticed by this collection. In fact, this type of material has a very close relationship with public education. We can only hope that future educational broadcasting lectures will pay attention to the above-mentioned materials.</p>
<p>Secondly, let us give a general review of the quality of the materials in this collection. After we have read the twenty-nine speeches, we feel that none of them are knowledge that the public urgently needs. In particular, the nine speeches in the Citizenship Training category and the fourteen speeches in the Scientific Knowledge category are extremely detailed and clear in their analysis of truth and explanation of things. Speeches of this nature are, of course, easily understood by the general public.</p>
<p>Now, let's cite two speeches to discuss. For example, Xie Guansheng's speech on the rights and obligations of citizens can be said to be very accurate and detailed in its explanation of the topic. At the beginning of the speech, he explained the difference between citizens and people. Then, he clarified the conditions for being a citizen, that is: positive conditions; negative conditions; and under these two types of conditions, he listed several kinds. The next is the rights of citizens, including: private rights; public rights; and under these two types of rights, he listed several kinds. After that are the obligations of citizens, divided into: taxation; military service; education; obedience. Finally, he expressed this view in his conclusion: "In summary, only by meeting the conditions of a citizen, fulfilling obligations, and then enjoying various rights, can one be a complete and good citizen under the legal system of the Three Principles of the People." After listening to such a speech, the general public can understand their various relationships with the national government.</p>
<p>Another article we want to talk about is Chen Yunwei's speech on the benefits of the national calendar. Originally, topics such as calendars are quite difficult to explain, but she was able to explain it in a very detailed and popular way, which is a rare achievement. At the beginning of the speech, based on the two movements of the Earth, the causes of years, months, and days, and the influence of celestial phenomena on human life, she analyzed the definition of the national calendar very clearly. Then, she compared and explained the Chinese sexagenary cycle method of recording days and the foreign weekly method. Furthermore, she also talked about the four periods of the Chinese calendar, and listed the three disadvantages of the mixed Yin-Yang calendar. Then, she compared the composition methods of the old calendar and the national calendar; finally, she talked about the benefits of the national calendar. Regarding this point, she talked from the national calendar itself and social life, especially focusing on the latter. For such topics that the public urgently needs to know and are extremely difficult to explain, she explained them very carefully and easily understood in an organized way. Therefore, we consider this article to be the best of its kind.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned two speeches, there are some that are also very wonderful; such as: Chen Daqi's speech on Citizens and Morality, Zhang Lisheng's speech on Why China Should Implement the Three Principles of the People, and Zhang Yuzhe's speech on A Brief Introduction to the Universe. In short, educational broadcasting lectures are a powerful tool for emerging public education, and we hope that they will be held continuously in the future. At the same time, we also hope that the "Educational Broadcasting Lecture Collection" will continue to be edited, printed, and promoted, using the power of text to compensate for the shortcomings of broadcasting. However, in terms of the materials for broadcasting lectures, we hope that the organizers will do their best to expand them without any omissions.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Reading Guidance Second Series (Continued) <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Bin</p>
<p>——Published by The Commercial Press——</p>
<p>Third, let's discuss; Chen Zhima's How to Study Political Systems? At the beginning of the article, he explained several research methods for political systems, namely; philosophical, historical, comparative, and comprehensive methods. At the end of the article, he expressed his understanding of political systems; in detail, it is: ㈠ Political systems are one of the organizations of human society; ㈡ There is no absolute standard for the advantages and disadvantages of political systems; The method of taking the advantages of Chinese and Western political systems and discarding their disadvantages can never be realized. Such an understanding, especially the second and third points, can be said to be very insightful. Beginners who read this article will have a correct concept and understanding of political systems.</p>
<p>Fourth, it is Ruan Yicheng's How to Study Law? First, he explained the process of law changing from metaphysics to science; then, he clarified the scientific research methods of law. He abandoned the annotation research method of law and advocated the scientific research method: this is a transformation that legal scholars should have.</p>
<p>Fifth, let's talk about Zhong Luqi's How to Study Education? He divided the methods of studying education into two major categories: ordinary and special. Under the ordinary category, he further divided it into three points, namely: identifying categories; collecting materials; identifying reading materials. Under the special category, he further divided it into four points, namely: selecting appropriate questions; adopting appropriate methods; seeking sufficient evidence; composing accurate reports. His conclusion is this: "In short, to study education, one must be precise, erudite, practical, and use scientific methods to transform education into a true science." Zhong's method of studying education is the same as Ruan's method of studying law. In fact, the scientific method is the most appropriate method for modern people to study various academic disciplines.</p>
<p>Sixth, Jiang Wulifu's How to Study Western Literature. Like Ruan and Zhong, Wu also does not regard a certain academic discipline as isolated, but must relate it to other academic disciplines, especially social sciences. Therefore, when he talked about the basis of Western literature research methods, he listed "the perspective of social science" as the first item. Secondly, one must pay attention to the special position of China, which is the second item. The third item is that one should follow the needs of Chinese students. Due to these three reasons, he advocated that Chinese people should have their own research purposes and methods when studying Western literature, and there is no need to imitate people from other countries. He also opposed professors using European and American teaching methods to teach Western literature to Chinese students; or only paying attention to the value of foreign languages while ignoring the content of literature. In addition, he believes that the purpose of studying Western literature should be consistent with the method; that is, first determine a correct purpose, and then determine the research method. As for research opinions and preparations, he also has unique insights that can correct the errors of general Western literature scholars.</p>
<p>Other articles such as Yuan Daofeng's How to Study International Politics? and Chen Lijiang's How to Study Public Education? all have novel and correct explanations and appropriate research methods for the academic disciplines discussed. In short, the second series of Reading Guidance can be said to have done its best to guide readers in both materials and content. (End)</p>

<p>6. Critical Research of Philosophy:</p>
<p>In philosophical research, the critical research method has its broad needs; in order to correctly receive the legitimate philosophical heritage in history, in order to be able to scrape off all the crippled stagnation existing in the history of philosophy, in order to be able to recognize the theoretical system of all philosophical doctrines themselves, in order to be able to correctly evaluate the value of all philosophical thoughts, and even in order to be able to develop one's own philosophical thinking in research, obtain new knowledge and theories, establish one's own philosophical system, etc., all have their necessity, which is a very clear reason. However, how to conduct critical research? To understand a specific philosophy of an era and give a critical research to this philosophy, then one must first start from criticizing that era, first criticize and understand the real life of that era. In addition, one should also make a personal independent criticism of the identity and lifestyle of a certain philosopher in order to truly recognize and evaluate his philosophy. In this way, if we want to understand a philosophy, and to criticize this philosophy, then the main thing is to understand the philosopher's era background and class background, and to criticize that philosophy from the criticism of the era and class; secondly, it is to criticize his philosophy from the criticism of his personal life process. We should finally analyze out that certain parts of a certain philosophy can become a legitimate historical heritage and be received and become the content of philosophy, and use this to develop our own philosophical thoughts and form our own new philosophical system, which is considered the completion of the research work.</p>

<h3 id="e218">High-Pitched Tune <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Li Sao</p>
<p>As the weather gets colder, the special scenes on the streets of Shanghai are not the colorful flags of discounted goods in fur shops, nor the smiling Santa Claus appearing in the windows, but the freezing and shivering expressions of the bums and beggars. To say that humans are not emotional animals is not necessarily true, because there are also people who are deeply moved by this expression, such as the establishment of soup kitchens and temporary shelters.</p>
<p>I am not very clear about the actual situation of these two institutions, but according to the records in the newspapers, they are obviously charitable in nature; no matter how short the period is, or how limited the accommodation is, they are much more beneficial to the poor than those who offer lip service but do not deliver.</p>
<p>However, in this society, there are only too many righteous people who sing high-pitched tunes. These righteous people always hide behind people's backs and even remain silent, but when something new appears, they become eloquent. Their words generally have a fixed formula. In addition to refuting you at the outset, they then launch into a tirade of complaints. As a result, praises such as "clear-headed" and "thoroughly resolved" are often attributed to them. But "clear-headed" is just clear-headed, and "thoroughly resolved" is just talking about it, and it's all right for others to be unlucky.</p>
<p>For example, shelters, etc., are of course not immune to their accusations. The first is that they should not be "temporary." Why should they be temporary? Do these poor people only need to be accommodated for these three months? After these three months, will they have a way to make a living? This is not thorough – The second is that there are too many poor people. Can such accommodation be as much as possible? If it cannot be as much as possible, then who should be excluded? This is not universal – But the responsibility of the righteous people seems to be only to shout out "not thorough" and "not universal." As for how to be universal and how to be thorough, that is "a long story," so I will "skip over it."</p>
<p>I am not against the thorough theory: I support thoroughness. However, I really don't dare to agree with the thoroughness of "high-pitched tunes" because its impact is that the shivering people are the ones who are going to be unlucky. As for themselves, after singing the high-pitched tune, they will immediately forget about it, because their main duty is to "sing," and "singing" is not limited to a certain event. When there is a need to "sing" in other areas, who can forbid them from singing loudly?</p>
<p>Under the current social system, there are reasons to criticize the establishment of temporary shelters and soup kitchens. However, the facts are in front of us. If we only sing "high-pitched tunes," even the few refugees who are accommodated during this short period will suffer a serious blow. Rather than watching them freeze and starve to death under the high-pitched tunes, it is not a crime to let them drink a bowl of thin porridge and sleep on some straw. However, the inherent habits of the Chinese people cannot be ignored, and that is the issue of the integrity of the handlers. Judging from the cases impeached by the Control Yuan, we know that even some officials are suspected of corruption, let alone charitable organizations – precisely because they are charitable, as long as one person manipulates things, the stomachs of many people will suffer. Therefore, under the current situation, at the very least, we require them to make their accounts public. On the one hand, it can gain the trust of the true philanthropists who donate money, and on the other hand, it can ensure the treatment that the disaster victims can enjoy. But this kind of shouting seems to be far from high-pitched tunes!</p>

<p>— Luo Yu</p>
<p>One early winter, I lived in the slum district of Nantao, T City. One cold night, I passed through the concession, dazzling with bicycle bells and neon lights, and walked onto the black, garbage-covered hills. The first thing that shocked me was a frozen, naked body, a dark, fleshly figure abandoned by the roadside like a fallen, withered tree.</p>
<p>There were no pedestrians within three hundred meters, only a ditch filled with black skirmish lines, lying ugly across the road. Surrounded by the cold, I felt a chill down my spine and hurriedly escaped across the small plank bridge to find those familiar young people.</p>
<p>Later, I heard that most of those corpses were opium addicts. They could go without food or lodging, inject morphine and sleep in dog kennels out in the winter night. They were originally not worthy of our pity.</p>
<p>The dockworkers in the slum district, even if they were hungry, still tried to find a place to stay. In the evening, they clutched a handful of copper coins and walked silently into the small shops. Those who stayed there were still their usual companions, inquiring about each other before sleeping on a wooden bunk. They could avoid thinking about those who were knocked down by the wind and snow.</p>
<p>One morning, I got up and went out at five or six o'clock. The sky was still gloomy, and the light snow of the night was still falling quietly. The snow on the ground was very thin, and it had not yet covered the remaining warmth of early winter, like white sugar placed on yellow rice cake, melting with the light steam. I was wearing a simple worker's outfit, which, though old and worn, was able to keep out the cold. Moreover, the habitual sound sleep had given me an overflowing life, so I went to the pier without hesitation.</p>
<p>When I reached the corner at the end of the small cross alley, I saw a living person sleeping on his back on the wet, melting snow. I was used to seeing this, but his clothes caught my attention. The clothes were neat, a black cotton robe and an old cloth vest. The robe above his knees was covered with a layer of melting snow. His hands were half-clenched, like a racing athlete.</p>
<p>I observed this life fighting against the cold with great composure. They were indeed fighting each other physically. He looked only about twenty years old, with his eyes closed, showing the red flesh of his eyelids, which looked very scary. The melting snow on his face was like a small snake winding around the roots of his ears, gradually killing this wandering young man. White foam was bubbling from his mouth, spitting out curse-like dental sounds.</p>
<p>When I looked up, I saw a middle-aged, hunched person at the entrance of the alley, as if urinating. He went around and went into a small shop. I wondered if this person was trying to steal the wanderer's clothes, which was a common occurrence, and no one would see it in this situation. On the ground were indistinguishable footprints, a layer of black mud, and a thin layer of snow.</p>
<p>Such an impression could no longer move me. I only thought: this wanderer may not be one of those opium addicts. Looking at his clothes, he is a countryman, not like someone who has been mixing with urban coolies for a long time. While thinking, I had already reached the road in the concession.</p>
<p>Far away, a tram drove past, emitting a clear, cold bell sound. There was not a single life on the street. Between the branches of the parallel rows of street trees was stacked unmelted snow. I stomped across the asphalt road, and at this time only a few workers were heading towards the river bank.</p>
<p>Suddenly, something seemed to explode in my brain, causing me to stop. I thought of the corpse I had encountered that night, and the broken house I had been to that night. It was a low earthen house, with light shining through the window paper. When I squeezed in, it was warm inside. Three young people were close to an old coal stove on the edge of the bunk, and a pair of smelly, broken boots were placed next to the stove. Their clothes were very thin. Another person was squatting on the bunk, covering himself with a torn quilt, only showing his face. Behind the half partition was another room, with several men huddling together to gamble, and from time to time there was a dull noise.</p>
<p>I remember that the young man covering himself with the quilt didn't talk much. But I knew he had run away from a village not far from T City. His protruding forehead clearly marked his rurality, and his eyes were vaguely suspicious. This is what made me recall with surprise and stop.</p>
<p>I hurried back, following the original road, wanting to save the poor fellow. I could no longer remember his name, but his face vividly poured into my brain.</p>
<p>The snow was still falling. I walked very fast, but I hoped in my heart that it was just a stranger, because the death of a stranger was something I was used to seeing. But with the damp footsteps, my heart was beating.</p>
<p>I had already turned into the small cross alley. When I reached the corner, under a mud wall, a withered body lay crooked in the muddy water. His face was covered with a lot of mud, but the most terrible thing was the protruding skull that I was familiar with. He had already stopped struggling and allowed the snowflakes to slowly sprinkle on his skin.</p>
<p>On the thin snow, there was still a row of footprints that were about to disappear, stepping towards the small shop at the entrance of the alley. Beside the person swallowed by the snow, there was only a pair of old boots placed on the snow, one of which was a pair of quite old boots that I had seen by a stove.</p>
<h3 id="e220">Mountain Sedan <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Luo</p>
<p>The so-called mountain sedan is just a rattan chair with two bamboo poles. Most people who go to Hangzhou to burn incense have had the experience of riding this kind of rattan sedan. However, the reason why mountain sedans are so simplified is to make it easier for the sedan bearers to climb the mountain, and also to reduce the danger for those riding in the sedan. People who are confined to the city already have a sense of fear when they see the mountains in Hangzhou. Going from Lingyin to Beigaofeng, there is a section of mountain road that is very narrow. People who climb the mountain on foot don't feel any danger because they only pay attention to the mountain road at their feet. Although those riding in the sedan can save their energy and leisurely smoke cigarettes in the sedan, looking around and enjoying the narrow Qiantang River like a jade belt, or the houses that are vaguely visible; but precisely because of this leisure, when they accidentally shift their gaze to the mountain road below the sedan, it feels like flying in the air. At the turning points, it is even more like the sedan body is about to fall down immediately, but the four legs of the sedan bearers in front and behind are moving firmly. They are stepping firmly on the stone steps, cautiously and quickly, wanting to reach the peak as soon as possible. They can also sit down on the stone railings in front of the temple to rest for a while, or even have a cup of cool tea to drink. People riding in the sedan often don't think this way, and they even forget the only merit of coming to Hangzhou—burning incense. When their eyes are closer and closer, they all think that the sedan bearers' legs may accidentally step on empty air, causing them to fall from the mountainside with the sedan and be smashed to pieces. Timid grandmothers and wives prefer to run out of the sedan and support themselves with climbing sticks, slowly climbing a section of road, letting the mountain sedan follow behind. Sure enough, their excuses are very beautiful: "Burning incense requires sincerity, it is best to climb all the way from the foot of the mountain to the top." Seeing the Mao Shan Taoists sitting cross-legged on the corner of the mountain, they are giving alms to the incense without missing one. But after climbing a section of the road, they also think that since they have already spent money to hire a mountain sedan, it is a bit wasteful to climb the mountain with effort, and besides, the grandmothers and wives who feel pain in the soles of their feet when walking on flat ground. Their thoughts turned again, they took a long-distance train to burn incense, and it can't be said that sitting in a mountain sedan on the mountain isn't sincere and pious. The Bodhisattva can forgive them. But when they sat back in the sedan, the mountain was even higher, and they were worried that the sedan bearers' legs would step on empty air. A wife once told me that her psychological analysis when she went up the mountain to burn incense may also be the climbing psychology of general grandmothers and wives? I have also climbed the mountains in Hangzhou, but I have never ridden in a mountain sedan, and I don't know how I would panic when sitting in a mountain sedan? This time I traveled to Huangshan, I rode in a mountain sedan. Comparing Huangshan to the peaks of Hangzhou is truly incomparable; but using the psychology of sitting in a Huangshan mountain sedan to infer the psychology of sitting in a Hangzhou mountain sedan can be seen in general. I can't describe the scenery of Huangshan, sitting in the sedan, my eyes didn't have free time to peep at the sedan bearers' legs. The mountain road is probably narrower and more straight, and the sedan bearers often carry the bamboo poles in their hands instead of shouldering them. At the turning points, the sedan bearers in front lift the bamboo poles, while the sedan bearers in the back raise them above their heads. It looks like the sedan is attached</p>

<p>As if standing on solid ground, even if I were overlooking a deep abyss, I would never have thought of becoming a ghost in a foreign land along with the sedan chair. Because I wanted to test my courage, I had been staring at the legs of the sedan carriers, but they moved so fast that I couldn't even see the mountain road clearly, making me feel like I was riding the clouds. In that case, when the person and the sedan chair tumble down, I probably wouldn't think about the danger after falling, but only see the mountain spinning before my eyes. I have never flown in an airplane, but based on this experience of riding a mountain sedan chair, it seems that even if I have the opportunity to fly in an airplane, I would never think about how the poet Xu Zhimo died.</p>

<p>Common Knowledge of Tuberculosis Prevention</p>
<p>Dunben (800) 7:15 PM to 8:00 PM</p>
<p>The harm of tuberculosis is more cruel than guns and cannons, but people have not paid attention to it. They do not know the methods of prevention, nor do they know the importance of early diagnosis. As a result, they delay and make mistakes, and are eventually killed by tuberculosis bacteria (i.e., tubercle bacilli). What a pity!</p>
<p>The rampant spread of tuberculosis in our country is truly terrifying. The number of people who die from this disease each year is as high as 1.4 million, and the number of people suffering from tuberculosis is 27 million (an average of six out of every hundred people, and one out of every sixteen people suffer from tuberculosis). If calculated by time, three people die from tuberculosis every minute. Just imagine how significant this loss of talent and economy is! Moreover, most of those who die from tuberculosis are young people. They are the productive forces of society, and they are giving their all, but just when they are about to achieve something, they are swallowed up by tuberculosis. What a pity!</p>

<p>Cao Xiaoying's "Yu Qingting"</p>
<p>Zhongxi (1040) 1:00 PM to 1:45 PM</p>
<p>Opening Passage: "Busy with Socializing"</p>
<p>The romantic affairs are lively and unrestrained. Celebrations and funerals involve a lot of expenses. Zhao, Qian, Sun, Li, Zhou, Wu, Zheng. It's hard to distinguish, the three strokes of Wang and the grass head of Huang. Funeral notices and invitation cards go without saying. Sixty or seventy years old, definitely offer a toast. One-cent stamps fly all over the sky. Unobstructed passage in all directions. Friendships exist everywhere. Spring breeze and summer rain naturally correspond. However, families in the mainland are already afraid of the bitterness of socializing. That taste in Shanghai is even more difficult to bear. When a child is one month or one year old. Sending out invitation cards, what harm is there? The lady of the house, twenty or thirty years old. A grand banquet celebrates a magnificent hall. The person himself adds even more excitement. Small banquets are common on birthdays. Also, every family has ancestral halls. Not willing to forget the morning and evening sacrifices. Filial sons and virtuous grandchildren are praised by everyone. Red envelopes are written with incense. If they could know in the dark. They would smile happily in the underworld. The anniversary of the burial is calculated separately. Plus entering the ancestral hall. The four seasons revolve in a circle. Red and white posts are really like urging grain. Or, the Zhang family misses something, the Li family sends it. There will be no discussion about it tomorrow. It can be seen everywhere in society. The ways of the world have always been fickle. Wealthy</p>

<p>Merchants are not discussed. Brokerage families secretly grieve. Especially the poor man who has a difficult life. Forcibly putting on airs and climbing the stage. People don't consider people's strength, those who give gifts secretly cry out injustice. Sending invitation cards and inviting guests on behalf. I'm just afraid that teachers will be continuously dismissed in the future. I say, reform the social customs and advocate practicality. Socializing doesn't have to be overly extravagant. Every family has weddings, funerals, and celebrations. Unnecessary socializing should be improved. Don't follow the superficial customs and learn to show off.</p>

<p>Opening Passage: "Golden Hairpin Throws Herself into the Well"</p>
<p>It's as hot as steaming in the fragrance of water chestnuts and lotus. The cicadas chirp incessantly. Lady Wang is, tired of calling and instructing Golden Hairpin to massage her legs while she reclines. Who knows, a little Shen Ying came. Golden Hairpin is, with her head lowered, smiling, and her eyes closed. She refuses Shen Ying and refuses to be disturbed. Baoyu is, secretly eating her lipstick, and they awaken from a dream after teasing each other. Lady Wang is, slapping Golden Hairpin on the head to scold her, scaring Shen Ying to run outside. Who would have thought that the lady would be so angry. Suddenly she was expelled from the garden gate. Golden Hairpin is, containing her grievances and unable to explain, she laments in sorrow. There's nothing to do but the lady doesn't listen. Calling her mother to lead her back and first choose a spouse. She cannot enter Rongning Palace with an excuse. Golden Hairpin resents extremely and throws herself into the well. Reporting it to the lady, who gets a big shock. Lady Wang is, deeply regretting that she was too hasty at the time. She unexpectedly, took the life of a close maid. Later, Jia Zheng enforced family law. He was hit by Huan'er's revenge. It's all because, Golden Hairpin throwing herself into the well hurt Shen Ying.</p>

<p>Opening Passage: "Betrothal"</p>
<p>Seeing her kind face in the White Cloud Nunnery. Miss is, her mood sunk in despair, her hatred doubled. The aunt is, enduring the years with morning bells and evening drums. Enduring that, the cold indifference of the snobbish nuns. Teaching anger to fill her chest. Ordering the steward to be attentive in the future. Also, the madam of the west courtyard must be kept in the dark. Listening, the sound of promise is continuous with each instruction. From now on, Madam has the right to settle down. However, her sadness for her son doubles her pain. That is, Old Madam Bi is filled with ten thousand sorrows. The romantic affairs of children are always tangled. It is only because the selection of concubines is extremely strict by imperial decree. She pities the maidservant in the boudoir. Nurturing her like a flower for eighteen years. Moreover, her temperament is gentle and her appearance is dignified. Her piano doesn't yield to Ban Ji. Praising her singing can be compared to Daoyun. It's difficult to ride the dragon. Only, the Fang family's young master is the most elegant. Consulting with the two sons and recruiting a son-in-law. Mother, he is, the family of Song Ting who was betrothed earlier. That madam did not heed. The letter of matrimony was quickly written with flowery words. Diligently inviting to the Plum Blossom Bookstore. Sisters-in-law sitting shoulder to shoulder behind the screen. Wanting to tell that, the matrimony will be linked face-to-face in the Green Wutong Hall.</p>

<p>The most popular production of Tianyi Film Company, "Female Classmates", is a sound epic about the romance of male and female classmates. The beautiful rising star Chen Qixia plays a smart, lively, and utterly childish female student. Her acting skills have achieved even more rapid progress than in "Huangpu Riverbank". Fan Xuepeng and the new popular young actor Tao Jin co-star. Jiang Jingcheng, Liang Lvyuan, Leng Bo, Wang Huijuan, Xiao Zhengzhong, Shen Yalan, Li Lin, Ning Xuan, and others also play important roles. The play aims to promote the spirit of mutual help among classmates and guide young people on the right path in life. It not only contains educational significance but is also full of dramatic interest. The depth of expression is especially thought-provoking. It is now scheduled to be released at the Jincheng Grand Theater starting on the 18th of this month (Friday), it is said.</p>

<p>—In "Eternal Smile"—</p>
<p>In Wu Village's "Eternal Smile".</p>
<p>Hu Die, to raise the last hundred yuan for her lover Gong Jianong, was threatened by money to satisfy the animal desires of a pawnshop owner, Cheng Zhao, with her body and obtain one hundred yuan. Her exhausted body walked out of the pawnshop in the storm. Unexpectedly, her uncle Luo Kuang robbed her of the money she had obtained in that way. She cried, she shouted, but to no avail. She had to enter Cheng Zhao's bedroom for the second time. Cheng Zhao was filing his nails, and since he no longer desired her, he had become cruel and terrible. She was furious and made vicious accusations, and she had a big fight with him. She was pressed on the table, but her hand touched the scissors. She grabbed the scissors and stabbed them into Cheng Zhao's waist, one stab, two stabs. Cheng Zhao made a final struggling sound and fell to the ground dead. Hu Die trembled in great horror, widened her eyes and looked at the blood on her hands. Soon, she calmed herself slightly, quickly washed the bloody hands, quickly robbed the deceased's treasury, and quickly fled.</p>
<p>Soon, on a stormy night, the city guard caught a woman dressed as a man, and she was Hu Die. This sensational murderer was thus arrested.</p>

<p>The "Thunder and Lightning Drama Society", which has been established for more than a year, has planned several performances, but they have all been aborted due to script issues. Recently, they have been actively rehearsing the two plays "Children Without a Motherland" and "The Proposal". The director is Zuo Ming, and it is expected that they will be performed at the end of this month.</p>
<p>It is rumored that the No. 2 Studio of Star Film Company recently planned to borrow the basic actor Zhou Xuan from Yihua Film Company to film a movie. It is said that all the conditions have been agreed upon. According to officials of Yihua Film Company, it is true that there is a matter of borrowing Zhou Xuan, but it is absolutely not negotiated, and all the procedures are still in contact.</p>
<p>Lianhua's "Orphan Girl Martyr Girl" will be released exclusively at the Xinguang Theater starting on the 19th. The Carlton is probably going to be replaced by the Chinese Traveling Theater Troupe.</p>
