<p>關東軍之改造、使之能保衛僞滿寸寸土地、以禦任何强敵之大軍、此間日人皆視爲念要之圖、蘇俄遠東軍長此在僞滿　長　之東北西三面邊界一帶耀武揚威、則滿洲日人終不能一日安枕也、據關東軍參謀官某大佐聲稱、增厚關東軍之最後方案、雖未在本屆議會提出、然廣田內閣、早遲必依以實行、至於在滿增軍所需之經費、大約將列入一九三七至三八年豫算案中、或謂此項經費、將爲東京中央陸軍當局所考慮之六年國防程序之一部分、據未徵實之謠傳、中央陸軍當局、現方提出需費日金二十萬萬元之一種程序、至於此項方案、是否贊助將關東軍改爲常備軍一節、現尚未悉、此間現信中央陸軍當局之準備贊助關東軍實力之增厚、已由陸相寺內伯爵在議會中明白表示之矣、陸相曾重述其理由如下、　近來蘇俄之態度確爲侵略性、　蘇俄軍隊在俄滿邊界一帶源源動員、並屯集大批軍器、　蘇俄現正計畫在軍略上包圍「滿洲國」、</p>

<h3>我國食鹽問題（下）</h3>
<p>— 財政部鹽務署署長朱體仁</p>
<p>第三點，講到鹽的運銷現在運銷制度，大約可分爲五種：第一種是自山制，現在淮北，四川，陝西，甘肅，口北這幾省區，以及福建的上游各縣，廣東的省河潮梅各區，浙柬的溫州，台州，處州，河南的汝光鞏孟，湖北的鄂西，河東的豫岸陜岸，山東的東岸各區，都是行自由制，這種制度，凡是已經開放的區域，無論鹽商或是普通的人民，都可以自由報運。第二種是專商制，現在湘，鄂，西，皖四岸，淮南，兩浙，松江，長蘆，山東，這幾區的引商票商，都是專商制，這種制度，須有引票　的專商，才有運鹽的資格。第三種是包商制，現在浙東的紹興，蕭山，松江的上海租界，福建的閩南，廣東的雷，瓊，和恩，開，新，陽各屬，長　的永七，津武，和舊官運六十一縣，靈南的邊岸，都是行包商制，這種制度，就是指定區域，招商辦運，商人於規定期限內，可以有專運　。第四種是租商制，現在西岸的建昌五縣，皖岸的滁，來，全，山東的租辦各縣，都是行租商制，這種制度，和包商差不多，不過租辦的期限更短。第五種是官運制，現在只有福建的上游各縣，於自由制之外，並行官運制。以上的幾種運銷制，就法理而論，自然只有自由制度應該提倡，不過就目前事勢而論，還不能實行絕對的自由，只能採用有限制的自由。至於全國銷鹽的數量，二十一年度是四千一百七十餘萬市担，二十二年度是四千二百五十餘萬市担，二十三年度是四千二百八十錄萬市担，精鹽未計在內，近年銷鹽數量，比前較少，牠的减少原因，最聚要的，由於近年的農村經濟衰落，和金融恐慌，人民購買力减少，而稅重和改秤，也不無影響，關於减輕鹽的成本一層，上面於產製方面，已經講過，同時政府於鹽的運輸，也設法使牠减輕費用，如提倡輪運，便是减輕運費的一法，湘，鄂，西，皖四岸運鹽，歷來沿用帆運，帆運是用帆船裝運鹽斤，運費貴，時間久，滷耗蒐，加之船戶沿途偷賣，都是足使鹽的成本加重，如果改用輪船運鹽，那來，費用時間都可節省，　的損耗，也可减少，如是鹽的成本减輕，鹽的銷數，也就可以增多。又政府現在提倡工業用鹽，每担只收三分的輕稅，國內新興工業——允其是化學工業，需用鹽做原料的很多，如果能够充分的利用，銷鹽的總數，常然更可增加。</p>
<p>第四點，講到鹽的稅收鹽稅是一種普遍的稅，本來應該以較輕的稅率爲原則，東西洋各國的鹽稅，都比中國的鹽稅輕，有的甚至於不收鹽稅，可是在中國，過去省自爲政，各種附加很多，現在鹽稅雖然已經由中央統收，但是每年由鹽稅內撥付各省的恊欵，也很不少，照目前國庫收支現狀，暫時還不容易談到無稅問題，不過各省區的鹽稅，高低不一，高的每担鹽稅十元，低的每担只一元數角，輕重過於懸殊，歷年以來，曾經屢次加以整理，輕稅的區域略爲加重，重稅的區域酌量减輕，如二十三年間，减輕湘，鄂，西三岸稅率，有每担减至三元之多者，一方面固然是要避免輕稅鹽衝銷重稅區域的弊病，一方面也是爲平均人民的負担。民國二十一年度共收鹽稅一萬萬五千三百餘萬元，二十二年度收一萬萬七千餘萬元，二十三年度收一萬萬七千三百四十餘萬元，每年都佔國稅收入的第二位，（第一位是關稅）記得第二次全國財政會議開幕的時候，汪院長調詞裏面說過：我們常常有兩種矛盾的心裏，一方面希望財政狀况很好，多收一點錢，就可以多做一點事，另一方面，覺得我國連年天災人禍，國家稅收增多，就是要老百姓增多負担，心裏實在有點不忍」。本人對於鹽稅的意見，可以引用這幾句話來代表。</p>
<p>以上關於鹽的歷史，鹽的產製，鹽的運銷，以及鹽的稅收，都已經大略講明，此外還有一點須要附帶說明的，就是今後鹽務的趨勢，新鹽法，在民國二十五年五月五日，就已經公布，它的精神，重在就塲征稅，這是政府所定的新制度，不過當國家變更一種制度的時候，直接間接，總不免有困難周折及受影響之處，我們總須設法解除難題，和阻力，邁步前進，以期全國鹽務可以早早的走上正常的軌道，國家稅收，也可以更加穩定，同是便利民食問題就可以連帶解决，我想這應該不只是本人一個人的希望，凡是關心鹽務的人，一定都是具有同樣希望的。　（完）</p>

<h3>世運代表團隨征記</h3>
<p>中央社特派員馮有眞（第二信）</p>
<p>望穿秋水抵香港</p>
<p>昨天輪决香港、發出一信、報告了一點關於世運選手由滬赴港途中的生活情形、現在記者提筆寫第二信的時候、已離香港十六小時、距離祖國又遠了二百九十海俚了、（康特浮台輪每小時速度的十八海里）</p>
<p>郵船原定昨天下午一時可到香港的、但是因爲航行速度遲緩、結果到下午五時才到、這稽延的四小時、眞令人望穿秋水、煩悶異常、因爲兩天航海生活、多少已有點厭倦、在陸地上生活慣了的人、一有機會都想能早點登陸、舒散舒散、</p>
<p>在輪船靠棧的前兩三小時、我們已經看見碧水的兩旁、一連串的排列着靑色的小山、大家都知道香港是越走越近了、自從遠離吳淞口後、我們眼睛所接觸的、祗是一望無際的靑天碧水、所以這連串的靑山、不祇給大家許多希望、並且還予精神上以無窮的快慰、</p>
<p>點多鐘的光景、香港和九龍終於在望了、許多整齊的高大的洋樓、從海濱起一直建築到半山腰、山頂上樹木葱蘢、好像是加上了一層翠綠的實蓋、大家對這美麗的小島、報以一陣熱烈的歡呼、郵船漸漸的駛近九龍的碼頭、幾百人都堆集在頭等艙的甲板上、準備登岸、唧唧雜雜的聲音、鬧得人頭暈耳聾、同時汗奧四溢、令人作嘔、</p>
<p>叫點半點、郵船靠定碼頭、架好扶梯、大家正想下船的時候、突然來了一陣大雨、眞是大殺風景、幾百位在碼頭上歡迎的人員與甲板上的旅客、大家眼巴巴的望着、祇有搖巾揮手示意、這樣延滯了半小時、直等雨止天　、才爭先恐後、混亂不堪、一個個像虱子般的從船艙旁一個小門中吐出、我們總算在萬里長程中、完畢八百七十海浬的路途、先了一個初步的段落、</p>
<p>港各界歡送會</p>
<p>香港的同胞、對代表團這决出國所感得興趣、决不弱於國內其他各地的、由華人體育會的發起、香港各界除推了幾百名代表、過江到九龍輪埠歡迎外、並且在南華體育會會址、舉行一個歡送大會、但是郵船在香港停留的時間、預吿祇有兩小時、所以道僩歡送會、祇能舉行一個簡單莊重的儀式、全體選手下船後、由各界歡送會特備一艘專輪、迎接渡江、除掉少數因必需購物品、或有其他私務外、大多數都由香港海港乘專備的汽車、開到南華體育會去、歡送會由謝雨川主席、用廣東語致了簡單的歡送詞、陳君用國語宣讀備就的歡送辭、代表團由沈嗣良郝更生相繼答辭、賓主間所講的、無非是互相勗勉的話、母庸詳紀、進用茶點、遂吿結束、儀式雖極簡單、但是香港同胞這番盛意、是很可感的、</p>
<p>美麗的小島</p>
<p>記者山郵船登岸的時候、因爲看見秩序太亂、不願同大家爭先恐後、所以直到最後、才同來迎接我的香港分社的同人周野蓀韓文幹二君下船、那時歡迎的輪渡、已經開動了、我們祇得乘普通的輪波過江、</p>
<p>香港九龍間輪波秩序的良好、是値得我們讚美的、輪渡棧建築很大、但是祇用一個人、就把她管理下來、由入口到渡輪上去、裝了一個輪齒式的門、必須依次一個一個的進去、這輪决式的門、是由售票的人管理的、你向他納了費、他就把機關撥動、讓你進去、所以輪渡棧上、永遠是靜悄悄的鴉雀無聲、絕無紛擾混亂的現象、這一點我想是値得我們提倡新生活運動負責的人參考的、我想我們如果要使新生活運動推行得很有效果、根本上固然要注重敎育與感化、同時對于制度與方法、也不可疏忽、倘若我們有良好的制度與適宜的方法、必可節省很多精力而收事半功倍之效、</p>
<p>渡輪分兩等、上層爲頭等、每决納費一角、下層爲二等、渡資四分、掄上懸了一塊禁牌、規定　脚不許放在坐椅上、　不許拋擲烟頭、　不准吐痰、大家都照着做、所以船上是十分淸潔、船是兩頭都可行駛的、無須掉頭轉身、速度也很快、七八分鐘可到、每十分鐘對開一决、據說營業很發達、我們沿長江的大埠、如南京浦口間、武昌漢口間、應該照這樣方法改進、</p>
<p>雨後的香港置是一塵不染、馬路的淸潔平滑、恐怕很多家庭的地板、都不及他吧、天氣又是那樣的凉爽、絕不像我們理想中的南國的氣候、偉大的洋樓、排列得十分整齊、電事汽車在寬闊的馬路上、雖然往返也很頻繁、但是絲毫沒有喧擾的情形、在物質上講、這美麗的小島、是値得人留戀的、無怪許多下野軍閥政客、要挾着他們的造　錢在這裏做寓公了、</p>
<p>香港是我舊遊之地、全島的情形、以前巳經觀光過、除掉物質的建設外、沒有其他可以玩賞的地方、加以時間又是那樣的迫促、我祇匆匆的買了一些必需的物品、看了一兩個朋友、便在晚霞中、急急的回到九龍來、當我坐在波輪上的時候、一條五彩的長虹、高懸在蔚藍色的天空中、爲這美麗的小島、增添不少的光輝、</p>
<p>離港續進</p>
<p>郵船靠椗的時候、原來布告在七點鐘準時開船的、可是我們吃了晚飯在吸烟室中談天游戲、直等到八點多鐘才解纜啟程、想不到外國人對時間、也有這樣大的差度、大家對郵船展時開行、都有點不大愜意、這不是因爲想早一點到義大利、而是失悔不能在香港多留一些時間、</p>
<p>無論如何、八點半鐘、郵船總是離別香港向新加坡繼續前進了、我們靠在船舷上的時候、看見香港全山的電燈、照耀得如同滿天的星斗、沒有看過這樣景色的人、驚奇得直叫起來、</p>
<p>半小時以後、除掉黑暗外、什麼都看不見、前夜懸掛在空中的明月、照理應該擴大她的圓形的、可是滿天的烏雲、不知把她藏匿到什麼地方去了、海風吹來、一陣緊似一陣、巨浪擊着鐵板、發出一種可怕的吼聲、船身有點一上一下的簛動了、這時不但甲板上杳無人影、就是吸烟室中也不若前兩天那樣熱鬧、可是有幾位還很勇敢、居然能到頭等艙裏看電影、</p>
<p>記者生畏在長江中小沙洲中、自幼乘慣了白木船、受足了巨浪洶湧澎湃的訓練、所以毫無暈船之苦、十點半走進臥室時、因爲浪花打進房內的緣故、僕歐已把迎風小窗關閉得嚴嚴的、多少有的悶熱、</p>
<p>昨天從香港登輪的、有足球門將黃紀良、高　選手黃英傑、游泳選手陳振興·楊秀瓊、體育考察團員許民輝·郭頌棠·劉權達·葉觀棪·譚鑒斌·等九人、使船上更加熱鬧起來、</p>
<p>輪中訓練</p>
<p>一輪旭日、叉從天水相接、處湧了起來、天空中恢復了輝耀的顏色、風浪也平靜了、許多甲板上又呈現着活躍的氣象、</p>
<p>習慣了水中生活的兩條魚—陳振興楊秀瓊—一早就換上游泳衣開始訓練、游泳池就在經濟二等的甲板上、是用厚木板架成一個方形、裹面貼上油漆過的厚帆布、造成了一丈多見方的小池、注滿了海水、雖不能施展身手、但是總比沒有機會練習好得多、</p>
<p>兩條魚在小池裏　游來游去、轟動了幾十位陸上選手在四週圍着看得發呆、一陣小浪、把池裏的水、翻了出來、站在近旁的人、潑得鞋襪畫濕、引起一陣哄然大笑、頑皮的符保盧、不甘示弱、也換上游泳衣、加入練習、他把灌水的龍頭、對着美人魚直冲、她沒在水裏躱避、可是回不過氣來、鑽出水面的時候、怪呌着討饒、大家又是一陣哄笑、</p>
<p>田徑和籃球選手、今天下午五時、也開始訓練了、地點在頭等艙的甲板上、這是特別交涉的結果、在到香港以前、船長祇答應每天早晨五至九時、可以借用、但是這個時間、頭等艙的旅客固然尙在夢鄕、我們的選手也未始不要休息、所以從上海出發後、到今天才開始訓練、訓練的方法很簡單、大家跑步十分鐘、籃球選手並練習傳遞、因爲這是在輪船上練習的最可能的方法了、不然在船上吃了睡、睡了吃、很容易加重十磅八磅、那不是開玩笑的、這樣的訓練、以後每天將舉行一决、</p>
<p>亞林匹克　躍水比賽之內容及各式躍水之圖解（四）　錢一勤</p>
<p>第一類、正面向水、向前躍水甲表　簡單向前頭墮</p>
<p>第一類、正面向水、向前躍水甲表　向前屈體躍水</p>
<p>第一類、正面向水、向前躍水甲表　寅向前縮體翻騰</p>
<p>晚上雖然仍有一點風浪、大家都還受得住、頭等甲板上開着電影、去看的人不少、但是大隊人馬、還是集中在經濟二等的甲板上、胡琴聲、京戲聲、猜拳聲、鬧做一團、直到十點多點、才歸安靜、</p>
<p>船上的職員、發起一種呌作「賽馬」的遊戲、實際是變相的賭博、方法是這樣的、一條長長的帆布、劃着六條跑道、每道又分成十格、起點處、放着六隻木馬、參加的人、要買票、然後用骰子挪、挪出幾點、就把幾號馬移動一格、誰先移到終點、誰就得勝羸錢、但是結果、祇有一個義大利旅客去買票、船上的職員看見玩不成、祇好把帆布沒精打彩的收捲起來、</p>
<p>夜深了、明天再寫、六月二十九日夜於輪中（未完待明日續）</p>

<p>中國衛生教育社第一屆年會特刊衛生敎育在中國應注重的兩大目標  胡定安　　提倡健美運動　實踐心理衛生　　衛生敎育由我們鼓吹與宣傳，漸漸地達到普遍灌輸，人們至少要把衛生敎育實施的事項發生印像起來，有了確切的認識，才能發生效力，歐美各國培養民族力量的總目標，不但僅注意於國民健康，並且注意到後代的遺傳與種族的改善，只都是根據於生物進化的原理來决定政策的，所以衛生敎育的實施步驟，從初步最平常最輕小的動作，如洗臉，刷牙，這些事起，以　講究到優生强種那麼偉大工作上去，每一樁淺近微小的有關衛生的動作，假使普遍到大多數人們一致的實行，這力量已經是不小了，用敎育方法來推進衛生，就是一種最敏捷的手段，必須見了效果才算是目的。　　中國積弱的由來，並不是從今天開始，遠因近因當然很多，女子方面消耗多麼可寶貴的光陰去講究自身上無謂的修飾，往往忽略了家庭的整潔佈置和健身運動，我們很仔細地算起來，如果一個女子可以把裝飾及其他跟着裝飾了以後無謂的用費，每年至少是可觀的，倘使作爲暑期修養練身的用費，或游泳，或至郊外避暑講究鍜鍊和營養，然後身體健康，表現富有血色的眞美，從新鮮空氣，日光與水的作用，使身體得保持固有的健康，發揮健全的精神，非先養成正確的健康觀念，不會轉移目光到健美運動上去的，現在無論男的女的，中年，靑年，少年都得要明白這個健康原理來大家普遍的倡健美運動，增進國民整個健康，這是第一個大目標，我們應該在提倡衛生敎育中深切注意才行。　　此外一般國民精神不振作，道德墮落，心理不健全可以做漢奸，可以喪心病狂，這都是我們國民的最大弱點，所以只有從衛生敎育想出方法來鼓勵民衆，先要使他們認識健康的利益，自身對於社會國家的關係，能够認出一切不良嗜好的不對，有了健全心身才有正確思想正當行爲，現在的中國，大部分民衆心理不健全，因此發生各種危險不幸事件，衛生敎育的目標，就要側重在心理衛生，要使整個的國民都要健全，耍從幼小的國民實施做起，符合敎育的意義，以上這兩個大目標，實在與國家前途民族存亡有絕大關係，所以要積極提倡，希望國人不要輕視忽視甚至鄙視，還得要努力實行，切實推行，以達到普遍的獲得我們所期望的偉大效果。中國衛生敎育社目前的任務  邵象伊　　中國衛生敎育社宣言中揭示了四大使命就是：　　一，灌輸合理而有效的衛生知識。　　二，糾正不合理而有碍健康的不良習慣。　　三，實現淸潔整齊的理想環境。　　四，推行健康而整調的新生活。　　這四大使命之間有着相互的關係，像是一條結構緊密的鎖鏈，缺了一環，就會破壞牠整個的連擊。然而這條鎖鏈之完成，却不是一件容易事，其推進的步驟，宣言中也曾說：　　「……這種事業（指衛生敎育），旣不是衛生界所能獨力進行，也不是敎育界所能孤軍勝任，却有待於衛生敎育兩界互相聯絡，通力合作，如此，我們相信定可獲得最後的成功」。　　由此可見若企圖完成上述四大使命，必須先組成一條極綿長極堅固極整齊的聯合戰綫，這聯合戰錢是由全國所有的衛生和敎育兩界的熱心同志門組成，其中每一個分子，也就是衛生敎育事業推進過程中一個基本的原動力，由這許多個個分離的力量，合而爲一個整個的力量，以這力量之强大，用來完成上述的四大使命，當不是一件不可能的事。　　然而這條聯合戰綫的陣容旣是如此其　大，那末，如何能使其中各個分子絕對健全，大家的步驟完全一致，而不至陷於散漫，參差，不整齊，無精神的缺陷，這是一個值得注意的問題。　　要做到這一步，我以爲必須從嚴密組織入手，組織一嚴密，一個極散漫極無生氣的團體，就會變成一個極統一極有精神的有機體，而組織不嚴密的結果也就適得其反。　　所以，中國衛生敎育社目前最主要的任務。當致力於組織的工作。量的多和質的精，應當作爲今後擴大本社組織的兩個並重的目標；而整個社團的機構，也應當以最大的努力，使之緊凑鞏固，總社與分社間，社員與社員間，都必須密切聯絡，耍做到像時鐘裏面齒輸一樣，一輪動則全體都動的地步，我敬以此意貢獻給中國衛生敎育社。民眾衛生敎育經騐談  張禮綱　　一，重要嗎　　「衛生敎育究竟重要不重要呢」？我們常常會聽到這樣的問題，換句話說，有許多人在懷疑衛生敎育的價値。　　我們回答這樣的問題，可以分兩方面說，第一是現在需要不需要衛生敎育，第二衛生敎育的功能究竟這樣？　　理論上不去談他，巴有許多人談着，談一些實際的經騐吧！　　一間小小的茅草房，不大，大的有二方丈大小，矮矮的，大孩子走進去便要低着頭，窓戶自然沒有一扇，大門也祗是爲了出人而設置，光綫也還不差，因爲全間房的深度亦不滿一丈，小小的門開着便可照亮了全室，但是冬天是例外，天氣冷了誰願意直開着門吹冷風，空氣的汚濁，在他們是不以爲意的，捏不港看不見的東西，還會對人生有什麼關係，菩薩也不能相信，這樣的一間便居住着一家五六口子，床自然是很少有，拿了一張蓆子地下一舖亂草一堆，便可以睡上五六個人，這是冬天的情形，夏天呢？更不成問題，在月明之夜，談天說地之後便可席地而臥，一覺醒來，旭日東升，生病活該，誰呌你得罪了菩薩，記得去年初到徐州的時候，我很　　着災民如此之多，晚上街上地下睡着許多人，後來方才知道，他們　是「良民」。自然不是都是這樣，但這機的究竟佔多數，　　住是這樣，衣食更不堪問聞，無論冬夏，麵捲一把，不問畫晚，白蝨亂爬，這又是多數這樣，　　這樣的民衆不需要衛生敎育—那眞是，「放屁放屁眞眞豈有此理」了！這是第一問題的解答。　　衛生敎育的功能究竟怎樣呢？不是爲了要保持自己的職業而說他很大已往的經騐，和個人的知識，都要我這樣說。　　要使衛生能不爲行政而設，換言之，要使民衆自動的注意衛生單靠行政的力量是沒有用的，需要敎育的帮　，因爲衛生事業的建設，同別的不同修橋開河，祗要政府建設，人民去帮忙便可成功，而衛生事業則除的物質上的建設之外，不得注意於人民的心理，沒有衛生的習慣和　度，衛生工程再建築得好一點對於人民的生活仍談有多大影響，而這習慣和態度的培養，却非衛生敎育不可，這是從理論方面來說。　　再從已往的經騐來說，亦是這樣。　　爲了使民衆能普遍得到洗澡的機會，我們在實施區內設了一所澡塘，除了收八釐水錢之外，別的一點也不再收費，奇怪這樣便宜的澡塘，第一二天一個人也不來光顧，老闆發了急，便舉行大規模的宣傳，實施區的先生更首先去洗以資提倡現正營業一天天的發達，每晚有四十至六十人的主顧這是衛生敎育功能的表現。　　「衛生敎育究竟重嬰不重要呢」？經過一年的試騐，我斷然的回答重要的，不必懷疑。　　二，障礙重重　　但是在實施的時候，困靴是很多的除了經濟知識等的普通所能見的之外還可以報告一點實地的困難，希望急於要求「拿出成績來看」的朋友加以注意。　　自民衆方面來說有如下的幾點困難。　　第一：沒有一定的軌道沒有一定的範圍，沒有一定的對象。　　沒有定的軌道，便不能有固定的方針，雖然最大的目標是有的，但這最大的目標不足指示他應走的途徑，沒有一定的範圍，便如海底撈針不可捉摸沒有一定的對象，方法便要隨時隨事隨地而更動，沒有成法可循。　　第二：不易拉住對象。　　民衆都有事情，白天操作，不能使他受敎育，晚上休息，他不願意受敎育敎育又不是行政，有權使他們强迫受敎。　　第三：過去的錯誤的觀念：　　「先入爲主」他們受了以往的錯誤的觀念的薰陶，祗是迷價着菩薩觀音，不相信科學，因此，要矯正這錯誤的觀念而使之相信你們的說敎，是難乎其難，在敎育原理上有所謂可塑性者，到了成人時期，便已經很小了。　　自從事於敎育事業的朋友來說：對於衛生敎育，亦有許多談解，是以妨礙他的推行。　　第一：把衛生敎育的範圍看了太小！　　有許多敎育機關推行衛生敎育，　作了疾病診療便算完事，疾病診療以外，便不幹旁的事情，其實疾病治療已不是衛生敎育的範圍，就是算爲一部分，也不過是一部分，不能代表他的全部，但因爲他們觀念的錯誤，便以爲除了疾病診療之外，一切可以不幹，因此幹衛生教育的人便失去了精神上和實質上的帮助。　　第二：根本實現頓生：　　我們常　　人家說：人民　　有　，還要請求衛生　，或者說：中國向來不　求衛生，也沒有個個生疾病，這種話，實在不値一笑，所以也不値同他們答　。但因爲有這種觀念，所以不給推行衛生敎育者以實力的贊助。第三：衛生便要化錢：　　還有一個根水的錯誤酌觀念，便是以爲衛生便要化錢，所以在「民衆連飯也沒有吃有吃的時候」便不能講求衛生，他們那裏知道我國的民衆的不講求衛生，已到不必化錢的衛生亦不注意的地步，不信，可以舉幾個例子，不纏足難道亦要化錢，不隨地便溺難道亦要化錢，但　足和隨地便溺現在却觸目皆是。　　有了這許多的困難衛生敎育的推行，自然不易有成效，但是我們便從此灰心嗎？不，决不，從事民衆敎育的人對任何失敗或困難都不灰心的，在萬難之中求出辦法來解决，才是我們應有的態度，同志們：努力吧，把定主張認識目標，向前邁進，時間過去了，空間總有一些改造的！　　三，一得之言　　怎樣推行衛生敎育才可以比較順利的進行呢？這問題很値得我們商討，現在就我們日常感到的提出來說一說：　　　要迎合人民的心理　有許多衛生事業可以借助於人民固有的心理，譬如人民都喜歡多福多壽，你便可以拿多福多壽的方法來作衛生宣傳的材料，但是反過來說與人民的心理直接衝突的衛生事業，應當極力避免，這並不是說這種事業可以不幹，却是說：要換一個方式去幹。　　　入境問俗　各地的風俗不同，施行衛生敎育的時候應當注意這一點，譬如徐屬一帶，還沒有十分開通，不能隨便走進人家的屋子更不能與人家的閨女接談，如果不注意，給民衆以不良的印象，以後便不易接受你的敎育，所以入境問俗，亦是很重要的。　　　適合人民的需要　民衆的範圍很廣，各種職業不同，年齡差異，性別差異，各有各的需要，各有各的注意點，我們應該因地因材因時，而施以各種衛生的敎育，這樣收效較大。　　　要隨時利用機會　民衆敎育沒有一定的方式，也沒有一定的時間，隨時隨地都可以施行，祗要不失掉機會。所以留意機會，亦很重耍的譬如徐州四月十五日（舊暦）的泰山會，有許多善男信女求佛爺的仙水來洗眼睛，這時候，若去禁止他，或同他講科學原理，他非但不信任，並且還要討厭你，最好的方法，是去同和尙商量，把硼酸水代替他那生水作仙水，這樣，對於民衆的確有利益，和尙耍的是錢，你去同他商量，他一定願意。　　最後我把我們實施所採取的方法說一下：　　我們實施的對象，有兒童成人和家庭三方面，實施的方法是輔導制每一個對象便有一個組織，作爲我們的基礎，兒童有兒童的衛生隊成人有成人衛生隊家庭有母統會和模範家庭。　　兒童衛生隊，由我們訓練，再由見童衛生隊隊員去敎導別的非兒童衛生隊隊員的兒童，成人衛生隊母親會模範家庭亦是一樣，這種方法試騐的結果，覺得還可以利用，一則所化的力量小而可以收很大的效果；再則兒童成人與母親之間，有着聯帶的關係可以互相影響，互相提醒。　　以上是我隨時感到的一點，關於實施的方法，巳在我們工作報吿中詳述（敎育新路最近一期）題名雖說是經騐，其實不過是一點感想而尙祈讀者有以敎之。</p>

<p>申報文藝專刊批評與讀後感  欽文　　批評的任務，在於介紹和指導。介紹重在讀者，指導是讀者和作者兩方面都有關系的。耍完成這任務，對於所提到的作品，必須詳詳細細的解釋。所以眞正的批評家，第一得熟悉藝術的理論，其决明白作者的個性與環境，第三能够認定目前的需要，第四文字寫得生動，好的批評原也是一種創作。　　雖然什麼藝術拿什麼觀點去評論，不失爲批評家的態度；但這只是爲批評而批評，對於人生的意義稀薄，未必有益於當時，總是不經濟的。時至今日，藝術品已由玩賞的進而爲實用的，當然要顧到目前的需要與吾。　　如果不明白作者的情形，不但對於作者隔膜，搔不着癢處，容易發生反感，就无所謂指導。藝術是人格的表現，沒有了解作者，當然也不能透切了解到作品的內容，所批評的就不免錯誤；這樣，就難以使得讀者信任；卽使附和了意見，也是盲從的。　　理論，這在批評家是必需的條件；所謂作家，藝術家，不曾系統的研究過理論，還可以勉强做得，批評家，却非懂得各種理論不可；吾則就不成其批評家了。社會上很有些人，並不會研究過理論，也在這樣那樣的議論別人的作品；雖然評長說短，洋洋數萬言，篇幅拉得很長；並不是正式的批評，元非是「讀後戚。」　　在這里，得先聲明，讀後感雖然不是正式的批評，却也有其價値。只要寫得誠懇，至少代表着一種讀者的意見，這於作者也很有用，是喜歡看的；在別的讀者，也不失爲參考研究的資料。　　自然，寫讀后感，態度誠懇以外，還得謙虛。如果夜郞自大，自命不凡，只是自暴其淺薄，那固然不是正式的批評，也就不是正式的讀后感了。　　一般人時常聽說現在眞正的批評家太少，論長說短的多半另有目的，無非是「捧」與「罵。」眞正的批評家少，怕是事實。其實作家也何嘗多？我却以爲，捧與罵不一定不好；只要捧得有道理，罵得合法，也還需要。因爲：作品總是多方面的，有壤的方面，也有好的方面；有道理的捧，只是側重在好的方面；合法的罵，重在壞的方面罷了，總不失爲一種解釋。假使一件作品，有捧的人，也有罵的人，合起來就有了整個的批評。　　所要不得的是，捧得沒有道理，罵得不合法。　　沒有道理的捧，呌做「亂捧；」不合法的罵是「瞎罵。」銹透了的  眉　　睡得正好，忽然給小床上寶寶的一聲哭吵醒。想爬起來走去看看他，眼睛却澀得睜多睜不開，便懶懶的打算不去理睬他，也許這小條伙是做着夢，哭一聲兩聲便會停的。這麼遲疑着，便半醒半睡的躺着等動靜。寶寶哭了幾聲還不見人打睬，便索性撒潑的大哭起來。她想起今天是星期，得讓毅多睡一會，便趕快坐起來，趿着拖鞋，衝到小鐵床跟前，俯在欄杆上，輕輕拍着寶寶，嘴裏低低的哼着，過一會，寶寶果然又乖乖的睡着了。她站起來伸了個懶腰，打算再躺下去睡一覺，再看看窗，却巳經透着亮。想起今天要讓毅享一天淸福，如果自己跟他睡得一樣晚，起來時屋子裏亂七八糟，早餐也來不及好好料理下些點心，這一夭的開頭就太不舒服了。想着便拿起衣服來披上，一壁打着呵欠，一壁收拾着屋子裏隔晚留下那些凌亂的東西。這時候犬已經大亮，娘姨也煮好了粥，在樓下嘩嘩的放着水洗衣服。　　等娘姨上小菜塲去買菜，她便在廚房裏做毅和寶寶最愛吃的夾沙餡蛋糕。聽到門外有呌賣的鮮花担子過去，趕快打開門，揀了一束半開的晚香玉，把客堂裏茶几上的殘花倒掉，換上這束新鮮的。　　一切料理好，樓上的兩個人還沒聲息。想起多久沒閒看報了，便拿起才送來的中報看看。可是那些消息全模不着頭腦，連幾個人名字也纏不淸楚，還沒來得看出一些頭緒，寶寶叉在樓上喊姆媽了。趕緊跑上去穿他起來，把一份報輕輕放在毅床頭的小几上，等他醒來好躺在床上看。　　毅一直睡到九點半鐘才醒，看完報，洗好臉，下得樓來時已經十點多了。正在客堂裏講着野人哥哥故事的母子倆，一看到他便停下。寶寶搖搖擺擺的跑到他跟着，抱住了大腿要他抱；母親便吩咐娘姨開粥。　　毅一面吃粥，一面問：　　「九九，昨天我寫好的那篇稿子，你給抄出了不曾」？　　九九呆了一下，不好意思的笑了笑。　　「忘記啦。」　　「這一早晨你忙些什麼？」　　「怕寶寶吵醒你，我講着故事哄他安靜呀。」　　「嘖！又是講故事！你這位太太。」　　毅近來時常用到『你這位太太』這句話，那意思便是設：　　「你沒落了，祇會做些沒出息的事了。」　　九九也很明白那句話的意思，心裏有點惱。打算發作兩句；想想又犯不上，現在不比戀愛的時候了，你待發一點兒脾氣罷，他不是揚長出門，便給你個一天落漠；你若好好兒溺愛他，服從他，那他倒也肯像個丈夫那麼愛着你。這一向來九九有了這經騐，所以遇到有些小小不快時，總是忍耐下去。現在她對於毅的那句「你這位太太，」也祇怯怯的笑了笑　　吃完早餐，毅說要去看個朋友。九九給他穿好衣服，打好領結，把手絹替他塞到口袋裹，最後把刷乾凈的帽子交給他時，兩支手揑住他兩邊手膀子，輕輕搖撼着，抬起頭來望着他的臉，溫柔的可囑着：　　「早點回來陪我吃飯。」　　「好的。」　　九九還不放手，溫柔地望着他的臉。毅俯下來親親她的眼，又親親她的嘴。九九的雨支手才滑下來了。　　利用毅不在家的辰光，九九把寢室又重新佈置過，忙到完，看看滿意了，才下樓去燒毅愛好的酒悶肉。　　一點鐘了，毅還不見回來，九九讓寶寶先吃飯，早些吃早些給他去打巾覺。　　等待人的時候是隨便什麼事都沒有心緒做的，九九不時向門外去望望，又回到客堂裹去把椅子挪挪，把花揷揷好，到廚房裏去轉轉，又到客堂裏再坐坐。　　鐘指到兩點，毅還杳無影踵，九九這才相信他是給朋友留下吃中飯了。無聊地呌娘姨開飯，草革的祇吃了半碗。　　飯後來了個女客，是毅的表姊，一位四十多歲的多嘴婦人，身後還帶着兩個不安靜的男孩子。因爲毅不在家，九九祇好一個人打起精神來張羅她。忙着擺糖果碟子，關照娘姨做點心，耐性地聽她訴說這樣那樣，嘴裏應着，此外還得小心着不呌那兩位小客人碰翻花瓶，打碎碟子。　　「書還沒像你那麼唸通，架子倒擺得天般高了，眼裏再沒我這個老太婆哇。打扮得個妖精似的——眞呌人看不上眼，頂該死的是阿灰也給她敎壞了。唉——」　　一句一句話像唸經般的聯着，中間沒空隙，有點兒空便咳一陣嗽，嘆一口氣，馬上又急雨般一陣話在噴射出來了。　　九九裝着聽她的話，嘴裏胡亂搭着腔，心裏却不安的念着那答應回家陪她吃飯的毅。　　「就是在人家吃飯，這時候也該回來了。」　　她悶悶的想着，那個老表姊却衝着她的臉氣憤憤的問：　　「少奶奶，你看天下有這個理數嗎？」　　九九完全沒聽到上文，祇好裝做同情的搖搖頭，嘆了口氣。這一來已經够老表姊滿意了，便更加憤激的訴說起來：　　「我的一尊白磁觀音是供在亭子間裏的——」　　九九心不在焉的，點着頭：　　「我見過的」。　　老表姊愕然的把眼睛一睜：　　「你怎麼會見過？我上個星期，才打南京路買來呀」　　九九慌慌張張的支吾了一下：　　「我說我在磁器公司見過那種磁觀音的。」　　「哦！」　　於是又滔滔的說下去了。　　那張尖削的臉在九九眼中漸漸成了個山羊。」張嘴，像喇叭一樣，永遠張大了嗡嗡的響着，好像永無休止的嗡嗡着。　　九九恨不得把個茶杯照準這煩瑣的嘴擲上去，好塡沒了那不知疲倦的喇叭口子。　　她心裏煩亂的佔計着毅此時在什麼地方，與什麼人在一起，做什麼事情；一雙耳朶，時時在期待着一陳急促的皮鞋聲；她的眼時時穿過客堂的門，看有沒有人來推開虛掩着的後門。這些都沒有，能聽到的還是那「嗡嗡」，能看到的還是那張山羊的臉。　　老表姊到五點鐘才站起身來走，因爲此時碟子裏的糖果都已吃空，兄弟倆沒了指望，百無聊賴的望東望西都沒意思，才催着做媽媽的回家去了。　　睡到這時才醒來的寶寶，好像還沒睡够，嗗嘟了小嘴在發脾氣。先是爲了娘姨拿給他的餅干缺了個角，儘吵着不肯吃，換了塊完整的給他，他又要開水，開水拿到跟前，又堅持着要「爸爸喂」。九九發起恨來，把開水在凳子上重重一擱，大聲說：　　「你喝便喝，不喝便呌娘姨拿去倒掉。爸爸喂！爸爸逃走了，不回來了。」　　這句話可鬧下亂子。寶寶突然跥着小脚，大哭起來，嘴裏連聲的嚷着：　　「我要爸爸！我要爸爸—呃！我要爸爸啊——」　　別人拿給他的糖和呌哥哥，別人哄他的話，一槪不看見，不聽見，只管撤潑的哭，撒潑的呌喊。震得聾耳朶的聲音，頑固的持續着，這弊音一把刀般劈着九九的頭，使她頭裏裂開的痛着。使盡了法子哄他，嚇他，全沒用，這小瘋子只管哭，只管撕開小喉嚨嚷：　　「呃，呃，我要爸爸，爸爸，我要爸爸！」　　九九哄到筋疲力盡還沒用，恨極了，便撩起他褲子來，在小屁股上拍拍的連打了十多下。實實殺猪般呌了一陣，給娘姨拉了去，慢慢的倒停了下來，坐在娘姨膝頭上，抽噎着啃起餅乾來了。　　心裹煩亂，頭裏又痛，九九一個人跑上樓去，在架子上抓了本書，躺到床上去想看看書，借此忘記掉等待的心焦。可是不行，翻過了兩頁，還沒曉得看的什麼柬西。索性拋開書，閉上眼。她似乎看見毅與一羣男女朋友，正從電影院出來，大夥兒跨進一家精緻的咖啡店去，那麼不拘形跡的談着笑着……毅與一個打扮妖嬈的女人，特別親近……　　天漸漸暗了下來。寶寶在樓下喊：　　「媽媽，吃晚飯囉！」　　看床頭几上的小鐘，已經七點都過了。坐起來，頭裹重重的。站到窗口，俯下去盼咐娘姨料理寶寶吃飯，說是自己不舒服，不吃了。　　時鐘的咯的嗒走着，九九的煩亂　慮，也與時俱增。　　把實實拍到睡着，小鐘淸脆的打了九下。　　九九的煩亂慢慢變成氣忿。　　氣忿又慢慢的變成了悲哀。　　她躺在床上自己想：　　「女人是一把刀，年輕時候，有亮亮的光采，有鋒芒的口子，呌人愛她，怕她，敬重她。一把刀丟在潮濕角落裏，日久便上了銹，鈍掉口子，失了光采，漸漸成了個廢物：同樣一個女人若被藏到家庭裏，與社會隔絕，便也會銹掉，失却了聰明，才幹，乃至失却了人家對於她的愛護和敬重，成爲一把不足重輕的銹刀，一個沒出息的廢物！」　　「於是她又想起了早上毅不遜地說出的『你這位太太』　　「自己與他受了一樣完全的敎育，智力和才幹，沒一樣趕不上他啊。回轉去想到初戀時，自己是個年靑，漂亮，思想前進，野心極大的女孩子，毅那時把她看得眞比他自己的生命都重要。可是一結婚，毅便了却一重公案似的把一切都看成平淡；自己却跌在戀愛裏爬不起來，朋友都丟開，一向參加的社會活動都放棄，事業的野心也拋下。她祇願意看着他，聽着他，厮守着他，看他看的書，做他要她做的事………於是一個桀傲不馴，光采熌燜的九九，在戀愛的歲月中漸漸消滅了，新生了一個溫柔的，服從的，毅的寄生虫。　　「隨後便生了寶實，自己又添出一個溺愛的，獻出心身的對象。弄得連毅看的書報也沒時間看了，毅要她做的事也沒時問做了。全副時問精力，都耗費在瑣屑的家事中，庸俗的親戚應酬中。漸漸的在知識上，思想上，趣味上，都與毅分離了，毅往前走，自己落後下來了。於是自已在毅眼中的地位，也很自然的從主子落下來，成爲一個寄生虫了。　　「自己也明瞭自己的沒落，事業的野心之類，丟開不去說它了；至少總得要改善自己在毅心目巾的地位，所以便盡力要自己使得毅滿意。可惜這件事是難的，男子心中的理想女性，條件太多了，你得漂亮，又得老實；你得溫柔服從，也得有驕傲的鋒芒；你得善理家事，也得參加社會活動；你得留守家庭，也得出外掙錢……那麼多的條件是難以呌一個人同時俱備的，所以自己雖然焦頭爛額，却還離那水準遠得很。　　隨着驕傲與自信都消滅，成了一個自己多有時能意識得到的，卑劣的，依賴人的寄生虫了。　　「爲的要守住自己鍾愛的人，爲的要好好保持着溫暖的小家，便祇能忍受一切，把天大的野心和驕傲，一齊槍斃掉！　　「我是個卑劣的寄生虫啊！在物質上，我要依賴他掙來的錢維持我的物質生活；在精神上，我又得依賴他的愛撫來維持我的精神生活。所以他儘管以主子的態度對待我。我是沒背脊的，站不起來的寄生虫！所以他雖然還愛我，却不再敬重我了。　　「我愛他，我敬重他；我也耍他愛我。敬重我！　　「可是他不！　　「他不僅以自己爲主體，且不承認我還有個獨立的人格，他可以說話輕侮我，可以丟下我等到這麼心焦，一點不顧念我的——」　　鐘打了十二點，弄堂裏靜靜的沒一點聲息。九九走到窗跟前，從鐘子裏看到自己興奮得發了紅的臉。俯到窗口上看看弄堂，沒有車子，也沒有人。自己又在心中罵：　　「爲什麼定要等呢？眞是個寄生虫，沒出息的！」　　突然有種欲望在她心中昇起：　　「我要做一個人，做一個獨立的人。我要把死掉的野心復活起來，卸下感情的鏈鎖，卸下生活的惰性，站直起來，鮮鮮活活做個人，過些有意義的日子——」　　沒來得及再往下想，車輪子的聲昔打斷了她的思想，再過一會，後門打得一片響了。　　打開門，看到毅倒在一個朋友肩頭上，一股子酒氣直向九九鼻孔裏冲。朋友帮她把毅扶上樓，放平在床上。又吿訴她，幾個老同學在一起暢叙，毅興致好，多喝了幾杯，所以醉得很凶了。　　朋友才走，毅便嘔吐起來。一壁昏昏迷迷的嘔，一壁苦痛的抓着床沿。嘴裹含含糊糊，像個孩子那麼撒嬌的喊：　　「九九，九九！」　　迷亂無力的眼裏，包着苦楚和愛情。　　九九急煎煎的收拾掉他吐下的東西，急煎煎的灌冷茶給他喝，嘴裏連連的應他：　　「噯，毅，好點了嗎？還難過嗎？」　　喝醉了的人把一顆沉重的頭賴在她膀子上，含糊的說：　　「你不許走！不許九九走！」　　說完便沉沉的睡着着。　　九九的不快，完全爲憐憫與柔情所克服。心中溫柔的想着：　　「他需要我的，這可愛的人。不要轉無聊的念頭罷。事業，使他幸福便是我的事業，」從病院歸家猴子和尙  艾蕪　　信成師這人，身裁高瘦，長手長足，樣子顯得靈靈醒醒的。坐的時候，總喜歡，把足也放在座位上，雙膝高拱在面前，讓手搓着足枒巴玩耍。和人作朋友，極高興說笑，就是比他高一輩的和尙，也無法不同他打起趣來。因此，他得的輝名，也不少，最有味的，就是我們的鄰居，一個愛爾蘭流氓，呌他做Monkey　monk。這種呌法，比我們翻譯過來，喊爲猴子和尙，還較爲有趣一點。　　他不大到寺廟去掛單，常住的地方，却是一些老太婆開的小客棧。這些老太婆，年靑時候，很放蕩，現在收手了，經常還吃一點花花齋，故對於和尙一類的客人，是滿喜歡接待的。　　平時專靠慕化爲生，他的牛皮小提箱內，經常總放有好些厚厚的捐簿。翻翻看，就可知道，他的本事，頗爲不小。裏面具名的，全是出十盾五盾的大善士，塊把錢的，却沒有。據他說，他化緣的時候，並不是低頭站在門前，做出可憐的乞丐相，倒是昂昂藏藏走進屋子，拿天和尙的口吻說話的，敝廟蓋迭大雄實殿，或者塑造五百阿羅漢之類，自然不離口，而緣簿的第一二頁，還用漂亮的楷書，將這些動人的詞句，整整齊齊地寫上。其餘空下的白頁，則貼着一根根紅紙條，其間且灑有許多金色及銀色的點子，眞是美好眩目。緣簿外面，再用黃綾黃綢那類東西，像對聖旨似的包着。光這樣的行頭，就够你肅然起敬了。再加那些華僑的頭家們，是一向處在佛敎國度裏面的，自然是師傳前師傳後，這麼奉承着　　他那每本簿子的序言，我都拜讀過的，什麼九華山要修廟子哪，峨嵋山要塑佛像哪，盡是些了不起的工程。我明白那其中的講究，就笑起向他說。　　「你够忙，包攬這麼多生意！」　　「空事！全是修五臟廟！……丟開，看牠做什麼？」　　他，人就這麼可愛，常是推開窗子說亮話，全不掩飾。他說過，你越現得可憐，就眞的要修什麼廟子，也沒人，肯多捐助你的。爲什麼？你看那些呌花子吧，難道肚皮餓，還半點假麼？可是，成天塞不飽肚皮。我自已，要把派頭撐闊氣些，全是一點一點，學成的乖呀。你知道，化緣，本就是怪可憐的，但你再做出乞憐相，那就更糟了。開首總得要，先抓住他們的軟處，那些善男信女們，……你們怕陰司地府　？……你們想菩薩保佑嗎？那你們不出點功德，積點善，怎麼成？……不管你柬說南山，西說北海，至少一開腔，要把他說得五腑不安，六魂不靈才對。……弄得他來求你，那你就不愁他不出錢了。……總之，全靠你一張嘴巴，和你擺出的派頭。說什麼，老太爺，老太太，你老人家心腸好，行行善呀。狗屁，他肯聽你的。你就看我們的老板，釋加如來吧，他也要打打拌拌，現出丈六金身。住的屋子麼，大雄寶殿。衛兵呢，八大金剛。單這威武樣兒，先就够你拜倒，不敢吐氣。這樣，人家才信得過，你有本事保佑他。……請再看一看土地菩薩吧，那樣兒，長不滿尺。公館呢，小小的，又是土磚兒砌成。不說人不尊敬他，就連野狗都要撤他一身尿。……我先前就盤算過，要是我這和尙，修成功了，賞我一個土地做，媽的，打死我，我都不肯幹！這是眞的，我走過好些地方了，人家給土地寫的字，嚇，那商直糟場人！橫額「吾土地也」，這還不像小丑登臺時的道白？對聯呢，「白天孤孤寂寂：夜晚冷冷淸淸」，完全憐憫的口氣。「燒酒甜酒都不論，公雞母雞總要肥」，這簡直拿菩薩來開玩笑了。……要是我們的老板，我佛如來，能開那張金口，肯說眞心話，我想，他一定會說，普天衆生呵，慈悲是沒有的，你們先要自家强起來呀。我自己永遠相信這兩句眞言：眞的軟不得，假的更要硬。我平日也就是照這兩句話在修練的。唔，話一說，就離題遠了，你們也聽不懂。現在，且看我這樣兒，狗屁不値，坐不像坐，蹬不像蹬，猴頭精怪的。可是，你照，我去化緣哪，……要是映在電影上……呵哈，那是哪里來的法師呀！……那種裝模做樣，那種了不得的神氣，那種耍不完的派頭，連我部要笑出尿來。我的一些同道，師兄師弟，一看見我，就笑着罵道「阿彌陀佛，你　墮地獄的！」其實呢，骨子里，羨慕得了不得。他們說：「眞奇怪，我們木魚都要敲爛了，嗓子都要唸嘶了，一天到晚，還弄不到一塊錢，你這傢伙，到底怎樣幹的？」我道：「老菩薩，你心欠眞，佛祖不肯傳法寶給你哪。」就這樣逗他們玩。永遠不說眞心話。你們在家人，就不要緊。懂得了，也不會抱一本緣簿去化緣。還有，我那神氣，你們也裝不像。　　他講話老是這麼一股勁兒，滔滔不絕的。我們每一决不愛聽的時候，就止住他道　　「不要吹牛了，沒事做還是請我們吃一點東西的好」　　因爲他是極喜歡把臉唱得紅紅的。　　「笑話！吹牛？啐！……我是向你們說法呀！……你們試試看，在這世間上，要是做人軟一點……」　　樣子一點也不兒戲，而且稜起眼睛，像要當面罵人似的。可是，接着還是呌人把滷猪蹄燒臘肉高粱酒之類買回來了，拿起筷子輕輕一點，笑着說道。。　　「請呀，…這才是正經事」　　卽使吃呀喝呀的，比我們還要忙，但他那張嘴巴，還是不忘記用來說笑，並且更加有勁，彷彿機器添了油一樣。像先前在廟子上，老和尙管得緊都什麼鍋子罐子筷藏得使人沒法拿着，他和一批小和尙，便異想天開，把撒尿的夜壺，也偷來燉過雞了猪肉。……諸如此類的事情，都笑着說了出來。　　吃完之後，他照例要朝椅上躺一躺，或者床上睡一睡，臉上總現出不好過的神色，一面拿手揉他的肚皮緩悠悠地說道：　　「就是這東西不爭氣！……一個人總是多災多難的，太餓過不得，太飽也難受。……有些人成天愁着，躭心沒飯吃。……我呢，日子像是過得出來了，看來又是有吃有喝，有說有笑的。可是，依舊乏味得緊！你們想想，天天都這般過去，不討厭得打哈欠麼？」…眞是俗話說得好，人閒就無聊。　　「你該還俗。」別人就一半打趣他，一半說眞心話，「接個把老婆，養他一大羣兒女，成天忙得你上氣不接下氣就好！」　　「這事情，我們只能偷偷地幹呀，」他有興味地笑了起來，「要是眞的還了俗，那是一切都完了？」拿手指一指光頭上的戒疤：「嚇，這是幾十畝大水田哪。」大的肚子摸撫一會之後就好了一些，便又坐了起來，燃　香烟，嘆了一。氣道：　　「嚇，想要日子過得好。總要有錢又要忙囉！」</p>

<p>相老道的神奇了。　　一個月後，相老道來的時候一樣沒有人知道他到那里去了。　　我到那鎭上的時候，已將近秋天了。但是那一年特別酷熱，蚊蟲仍是結隊在臥室里飛行，我因爲睡不熟，趿着拖鞋，搖着蒲扇到院子去納凉。院子里已經有許多旅客在那里談天，店主人也是其中的一個。他正高興地談着兩個月以前在那鎭上出現的老道，他恐怕人家不相信他的話，幾乎每一句中都是「我親眼看見的」。於是一部份人相信了，竊竊地私議起來。但是當店主人滿意地結束他的講述的時候，一個粗大的笑聲在院子的角落里放出來，那是那客寓里的老主顧販驢子胡二。　　在笑聲中胡二敞着生着黑毛的胸肺從黑暗里走近來，走到店主人跟前，他用蒲扇拍着店主人赤裸着的背脊，問他　　「老大哥，你丟了許多錢？」　　店主人用着驚異的目光注視着坐到身旁來胡二，院子頓時也沉靜下來，大家懷着將要有一個驚人的新聞發生似的視綫集中在胡二身上。胡二看見店主人半嚮沒有回答，他說了：　　「我從張家口回來，遇見那老道三决，他懷里有一個樟木人，說是靈官，每處地方都是騙了錢滾路的。哼，老火哥，開了十多年的客寓，遝不知江湖上的道兒？那老道手下有一夥黨羽，專門到一個地方探問各種秘密，那老道然後到那地方去賣相，什麼靈官，見他娘的鬼！」　　「老大哥，倒底丟了多少錢？」　　「沒有，沒有！」店主人還沒有十分相信胡二的話，搖着頭回答。　　「他付了你房飯金沒有？」胡二也像一個賣相那樣的口吻問他。　　店主人祗「噢」了一聲就沒有說下去了。　　胡二又放開喉嚨笑起來。（完）月夜  燕汀　　每年到了這個季節，漁村便給忙碌騰翻了。先是行里來掛秤，收買鮮魚，再後便有人也張掛起了酒館開張的牌子。小辮子，長烟筒，粗野的呌罵，到處充塞着。在那條小小的蛋石路上，每到了上月的夜晚，便徹夜的嚮着脚步，歌聲和囈語，小酒館里就給整個的紅面孔塞着。　　在這樣的塲合里，我認識了小夥子洪升，他是一個寂寞的人，不大喜歡說話，有孤獨癖的，和平常人不大合得來。關於這，當有人問起他時，他便會發嚕囌也似的：　　「爲什麼我要這樣？」他悽然地搖着頭。人家曾勸過我，說寂寞會毀了人，但我除了它，我一切都不會戚覺興趣的。……」停了一會，又「我曾在寂寞里度過了整整半生的，因爲在七八歲時，我便是一個孤兒了。」　　他苦笑着，伸出他底枯黑的手指，在桌子上輕輕地敲着，要一瓶白乾喝了，才站起來在店門外消失。現在，他就開着步子在蛋石路上走着，輕輕的拐過彎，又輕輕的在一家瓦房子外停住。悄然地向四面張望了一會，才伸出手去在竹窗門上敲動一下，接着，那一扇漆木門便慢慢的開了，有一個肥胖的面孔伸了出來，向他看了一眼又縮回去。　　他愁悶地苦笑着，面孔露着痙孿的床沿的一邊，用一種漠然的，顫慄的樣子看他。有一會，他悽然的嘆息着，便　　轉出了蛋石子路，由於習慣，他又望海瀾上移動過去。　　夜潮已經退了，海寂寞地在笑着在岩岸上，他像一匹倨傲的鷹隼似的兀立着，不時向海底那方投着漠然的愁悶的瞥視。他底心緒迷亂極了，他絕望着，厭惡着一切人底生活，厭惡着看來見海洶湧的潮濤和底嗚呌。他是那麼靑年，然而他底感覺是蒼老的，十幾年地，他幾乎完全是在絕望里生活着的；可是他有新的希望在慷憬，他不願無聲無息地沉沒，讓海來捆抱他，他曾不少回企着從那古老的生活方式里排脫出來：有一回是從漁村跑出去，在××一個碼頭上當起卸夫；有一面是當內航船的廚子助手，……然而，有一種看不見的力量，在螢惑和吸引着他，使他不得不又丟棄了一切回轉來。那爲着的，是一個女人，一個情婦，他認識過她已經是三年了一切回轉來。她曾愛過他，撫慰過他。　　然而，這回他底感覺變了，當他從外面第三度歸來的時候。他聽見過謠言：她和行里那小老板有了勾當。在她那窒人的懷抱里，他已再也感不到溫柔和幸福了，他相信着：她現在已反叛他了！「爲什麼她要那麼愁悶和冷淡呢？」他想着，心痛了！　　他輕輕的嘆息着，兩眼漠然而又笨呆地望着天，他看見一輪圓大的月亮，正悄然而又靜穆地掛在那邊，面孔蒼白地，似在嘰嘲他底無能那麼地笑着。這使他想起了那個曾爲他愛過，而現在却已投進了另一個人有力的懷抱底肥胖面孔。他不安的站立起來，有一種衝動在苦悶着他，移動着足，他望村里出發了　　他熟稔幾乎是本能地，在那黑漆門外止住着，剛想伸出手去敲那窗門，突然給一陣從里面丟擲出來的戲謔和喧笑吸引住了。他憤恨地傾聽着，嫉恨在他底心坎里廣大着，而至於完全窒息住他底呼吸了。　　第二天晚上，在酒館里我又碰到了他，已經是七八分醉了，愁悶地向我點着頭，又悲苦地說道：　　「朋友，我想這回我們將永遠不能再見面了，然在今晚我要離開這兒。」　　重新舉起盃子來，滿酌了一盃喝了，便跑到櫃台去還淸了賒賬，揚着手大踏步走了，　　約過二十分鐘光景，整個漁村給人聲溢住了，當我們得了消息趕到時，那個肥胖的女人，已經殭直地癱倒在黑漆門外；行里的小老板，斷了一隻膀子，給人抬進行去了。而在平靜的海面上，却正有一艇小漁船扯滿着帆，望海口箭般的飛馳着。在那爽朗的海風里，就不時帶來了陣陣尖亮的獰笑聲。這笑聲慢慢低弱着，而終於完全地在海波上消失了。割麥子的田裏  郭卡　　這是這村裏唯一的財主家在割麥子。許多拾麥子的人都聚在這塊田裏。拾麥子的人都喜歡到財主家的田裏來，這已是慣例，所以然，在這裏是無用解釋的。　　地主的大兒子提着百靈鳥籠來「看邊」（一），這時他正跟一個「看坡的」（二）蹲在田旁邊，指手劃脚的談論。　　那看坡的說：　　「就是那個，那個尖下巴，紮紅帶子的那個——」　　「就是她嗎？海依牛，」　　「海依半」是這位少爺的口頭語，在這三字的中間，常常夾進幾個笑的音波　　被指的那個，在彎着腰拾麥子，聽見笑聲，一抬頭看見，四隻賊忒忒的眼睛正啾着自己，就趕緊離得遠了一點兒。　　那看坡的又接着說：　　「就是她，今年春裏養的，火家都緊瞅着想拾回家去養着，却不知被毀壞了還是怎麼，都沒有找着，只聽見孩子哇，却不知在那裏，我還打着燈籠在那荻子塲裹找過。」　　「海依半！」那少爺感到大的興趣。「那孩子終究是誰的呢？」　　那看坡的稍微一尋思，就說道：　　「人家都說是你家少二長貴的底，誰知道呢！——說就是去年割麥子時候弄上的。」　　說後很狡獰的一笑。這一笑同時也掠過對面的臉上，他把眼睛向田裏一斜，說道：　　「我今天也看好了個。」　　「哪個？」那腦袋很帶點鬼祟的凑上去。　　「就是那個胖妮，有條大辮子，眼睛大大的，正在跟那高女人說話的那個，你看，笑起來一口白牙！」　　那看坡的像伙盯上眼睛儘看。　　「怎麼樣？你看？」　　「可茁壯！」　　「就要那樣的，那樣的才够味呵！」　　那份想像中的味道，不由的又在心裏掠過。　　「我認得她，那是大唐地閨女，——大唐病了一春了，蚤仗他閨女拾草掘菜，死和我對命，前幾天偸麥穗頭被我碰見兩决。」　　「搶嗎？多麼大的閨女！」　　這時一個長工忽然跟那「胖妮」吵起來，那胖妮偸了車上的麥子，被那長工奪了回來。　　那看坡的輕推了那少爺一下，向爭吵的那面擠了擠眼，那被推的就霍地跳起來，邊嚷着跑去。　　「什麼事？什麼事？」　　「她偸麥子！」　　「他奪我的麥子！」　　那地主的兒子半正經的向那女孩子問道：　　「你偸麥子？」　　「誰偸的？還不準人拾？」　　「不用這樣，不用這樣，還你的麥子，說着玩呢？」　　他敏捷的從長工手裏掠過那把麥子來，遞過去，在那女孩子接的時候，他偸捏了她的指頭。　　他回到那看坡的那裏的時候，那看坡的又向他擠了擠眼。他意味探長的報之以微笑說道：　　「不難上手呵！」　　那被侮辱的女孩子，紅着臉，傷心的想着爸爸的病，沒錢僱短工割麥子，自己在外面的吃氣——一抬頭看見一車子麥子剛推過去，閃出了的地方人家都忙亂的湧過去，自己也就打斷一切思慮，跟着人家拾起來。　　一會兒忽然有小孩喊着跑了半，大家都直起身來向北望，遠遠的一條黑牛背，浮在那一片金黃色的麥海上面，彷彿都市上的汽車頂一般的向東滑去，後面一個緊追着的人，眼看着要捉到那條翹着的半尾巴了，但那牛一轉彎的時候，却顯出牛跟人之間還有相當的距離。　　一時連長工加拾麥子的都直起腰來看得出神。驀地那「胖妮」發現有兩隻可惡的眼睛在向自己斜瞅着。她就突然生氣樣的把頭回轉過去。　　那地主的兒子對這舉動，稍微有點忌恨，默默的想道：回頭跟着你，前面那溝裏再打交道，不怕你——　　註：（一）「看邊」是種方言。每逢收穫時，地主家卽派人至田內專防拾莊稼人偸自己的莊稼，這就呌做「看邊」。　　（二）「看坡的」就像是田地裏巡查，專捉偸竊及蹧踏莊稼的人，此種人多一村或數村合用一人，秋收後，每家出少許糧食以與之。</p>

At the same time, Yan and Zhao jointly sent a telegram to Nanjing, detailing everything. The telegram was very long and was sent out this afternoon. Zhao, Yang, and various military and political figures went to the station to see him off. According to Xu, Yan was unable to attend due to a chronic illness, Zhao due to provincial affairs, and Yang due to training the defense corps.

<p>(Hankou) Today's English-language "Liberty West" newspaper published an editorial stating that the only purpose of the Ming Second Plenary Session is to avoid a "20-year-long" civil war, which would please the Chinese people. The newspaper's editorial reflects the views of the Chinese people in Central China. It is said that Chen and Li have been accused of pursuing personal interests instead of teaching the country and preventing civil war. It is determined that these people will be absent from the Second Plenary Session, so the outcome of the meeting is still uncertain. The eyes of the general public are now focused on Nanjing. In past Nanjing meetings, although representatives from the Southwest attended, the result was that the Central Government and the Southwest did not achieve any close cooperation. The newspaper concluded, "Anyone who cares about the welfare of China must hope that the meeting will achieve the best possible result." (9th Reuters Electric)</p>

If a written statement is deemed insufficient and a petition is necessary, then representatives, limited to a maximum of ten people, may be sent. The capital is of great concern both domestically and internationally, and order and security are of paramount importance. We dare not be negligent in our duties. Anyone who violates this will be strictly investigated and punished without leniency. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Legislative Yuan Passes the Provisional Income Tax Regulations; Exemptions for Pensions and Alimony; It is Reported That Collection Will Begin Next Month</h3>

<p>(Nanjing) When the Legislative Yuan reviewed the Income Tax Law on the 9th, Ma Yinchu argued that the income of profit-making enterprises jointly run by the government and businesses should be clearly defined for taxation to avoid loopholes. The Shanghai groups telegraphed requesting that interest income from employee savings be exempted from taxation and should be considered. Stocks should not be included in the tax list. As a result, the Yuan meeting adopted the first two items to a considerable extent, but the third item was not passed. Zhang Zhihan advocated exempting pensions, old-age care, and alimony for the disabled, laborers, and those unable to support themselves, which was unanimously passed.

<h3>The Opening of the Second Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Executive Committee</h3>
<p>— Gao</p>
<p>The Second Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Executive Committee has opened today. Talented and accomplished individuals flocked to attend. The grand occasion is imaginable. At a time when worries and troubles are intertwined, foreign aggression is increasing, and the Guangdong and Guangxi regions have recently experienced unrest, the hearts of the people across the country are filled with anxiety. This meeting was convened to address the needs of the times. It is certain that through the discussions of the wise men, a path that can be followed will be found to solve the current national crisis. All Chinese people are eagerly looking forward to it. The responsibility of the officials at the conference is paramount.</p>
<p>The prerequisite for dealing with national crises is nothing more than sincere unity. The people know it, the government authorities know it, and even the soldiers in Guangdong and Guangxi must know it. Knowing it but failing to put it into practice, it has remained a slogan to this day. What is the reason? We think about it, we think about it again. Is it that personal emotions cannot be suppressed? Are the ideas of rights not completely eliminated? At a time when the country is in danger, how can there be such superficial views? I dare not falsely accuse the wise men and heroes in the country. Let us further consider that the opposing sides must be skillfully sowing discord, and the unscrupulous politicians are taking advantage of it, creating an atmosphere of unease, which gradually becomes a major obstacle to resisting foreign aggression. Given China's vast land, abundant resources, and large population, if we can concentrate our strength, how can we say that national salvation is impossible? Therefore, unity benefits us, but it is a great disadvantage to others. They will try every means to break us one by one, which is inevitable. However, we are willing to act as鹬蚌 (snipe and clam) for others to exploit. Nothing is more painful than this. The sole keynote of this conference is how to lay the foundation for a unified situation and save the chaotic steps. All Central Executive Committee members attending the meeting should, based on their conscience and the proposition of saving the country, earnestly communicate the opinions of all parties to avoid falling into other people's schemes. They should warn each other to unleash the entire national strength. They should encourage each other to eliminate any discord and abandon any rights under the principle of resisting foreign aggression and saving the country. In this way, the will can be unified and the steps can be aligned. If you ask anyone on the street, no one will not take this as the minimum goal of the request.</p>
<p>Since the unrest in Guangdong and Guangxi, domestic documents have been exchanged, mostly calling for halting on the brink of disaster. The Central Government's decision to convene the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee is to use the macroscopic effect of gathering wisdom and benefiting everyone to plan for the great plan of saving the country and resisting foreign aggression. At the same time, it also allows Guangdong and Guangxi to have the opportunity to express their opinions to eliminate past gaps. We only worry that Guangdong and Guangxi may be proud of the temporary mood and even refuse to participate, which will deepen the rift and darken the future of unity. Fortunately, both sides have been able to take the overall situation into consideration and avoid conflict. Yu Hanmou has already flown to the capital to meet with the authorities, and Huang Linshu and other five members have also rushed to Beijing to attend the conference. Moreover, Li Hanhun, a soldier from Guangdong, cabled the Central Government, requesting that the situation be guided in a favorable direction, believing that the power must be unified and the military orders should not be divided. The solemn words are enough to be a model. It is expected that there will be no major differences at the meeting, and the haze caused by the conspiracy will eventually be dispelled under the candid understanding.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Central Committee member and Army Commander Yu Hanmou telegraphed famous generals in Guangdong on the 9th, stating that Guangdong and Guangxi were raising troops under the banner of resisting Japan. Hanmou advised against this, but his advice was not followed. Therefore, there were the Dong and Zhi telegrams from the Southwest institutions, using foreign enemies to incite war and burdening the central government with internal troubles. The whole country, alarmed by the national crisis, ran around appealing for peace. This is enough to see the trend of popular sentiment. I believe that peace can resist aggression and unity can face the outside world. The country is in such a crisis, what other options are there besides obeying the central government and uniting our strength? Hanmou arrived in Beijing by plane on the 8th to attend the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, hoping to salvage the situation with this sincerity. I hope that all my comrades will share the same spirit. Rather than internal strife, which is abhorred by the people, why not unite to resist foreign aggression and defend against the torrent for humanity? Hanmou, following the strategy personally taught by Chairman Chiang, will return to the army in the coming days, adhering to the warning against fratricide and seeking a way to prevent future troubles. We all advocate unity to overcome national difficulties and obey orders. I respectfully express my heartfelt feelings. It is said that Yu has already sent this telegram throughout the country.

Many powerful generals are dissatisfied with the policies of the Southwest Political Affairs Committee, believing that the current national crisis was caused by the committee. For weeks, there have been rumors that there will be internal rebellions and betrayals within the Guangdong army. The recent defection of a portion of the Guangdong air force to the Central Government is proof of this. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Tang Hai'an Gives a Talk in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Tang Hai'an returned to Hong Kong from the province on the Foshan ship on the evening of the 9th. He stated that he had brought a personal letter from Kong Xiangxi to Guangdong, which he delivered to Chen Jitang to discuss reforming the silver dollar system. The letter was extremely sincere. After negotiations, a concrete plan was agreed upon. Guangdong will hand over 20 million silver dollars to any Central Bank representative for deposit in Guangdong, Hong Kong, or Shanghai, to be used as a foreign exchange fund. The Central Government will issue 20 million silver dollar notes to Guangdong. Guangdong will no longer issue paper money. Tang Shoumin and Bei Zuyi will go south to handle the handover of silver after the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee. Regarding the current situation, Yu stated he spoke to Chen for an hour. Many military officers were present at the time. Chen understood the Central Government. As far as Yu knew, the Central Government had no intention of using force against Guangdong. The troops stationed in Hunan and Jiangxi are being gradually transferred north. The Central Government's attention to reorganizing Guangdong's finances shows its concern for Guangdong. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Zhang Zizhong Discusses the Recent Diplomatic Situation in Hebei and Chahar</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Zhang Zizhong stated that the previous negotiations on the diplomacy of Hebei and Chahar were roughly divided into two steps: first Hebei East, then Chahar. There have been no formal contacts recently. The organization of Hebei East has been abolished, but there is a good trend. I am not responsible for making concessions. Everything is discussed between Chen Zhongfu and Matsumuro. Recently, there have still been many rumors circulating. Some people have asked me about them, and I have told them that the situation in North China is always fluctuating, especially Tianjin, which is a rumor zone. We are used to hearing them and do not feel as sensitive as people outside. As for the rumored organization of four provinces to protect their borders, I have never heard of it. The other side has not made any new demands recently. There have been no messages from Song Zheyuan coming to Tianjin or from Han Fuju going to and fro. Regarding the current situation in northern Chahar, it is said that Li Shouxin is still acting independently and is not under control. De Wang has no intention of moving south. As for the rumors about my own movements, that was a matter of two months ago, which is now in the past. The claim that the Hebei provincial government is being reorganized is also just a newspaper report. In fact, there is no such thing. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Tianjin Municipal Public Works Bureau to Be Abolished</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Zhang Zizhong said that the Tianjin municipal organization and budget have been submitted to the Municipal Improvement Committee for discussion. The Municipal Council will also discuss this in detail this week. Since the Public Works Bureau has little to do, it has been decided to abolish it and have the Social Affairs Bureau set up a section to handle it concurrently. Other bureaus are still being reorganized and have not been finalized. However, since social education is a busy area, it should have its own dedicated responsibilities, so it will be separated. In previous years, the city's finances had a deficit of about 300,000 yuan. Mayor Xiao accumulated a deficit of 500,000 yuan due to special construction projects. He plans to rectify tax collection and make up for it without increasing taxes. Liu Yushu, the Director of the Public Works Bureau, has resigned and will be succeeded by Liu Xizhong. Before he takes office, the Deputy Director, Li Yinqiu, will act on his behalf. The number of police officers in the city is less than in Beiping. After Public Security Director Cheng submits his report, an increase in recruitment may be approved. (9th Dispatch)</p>

I am here to present my credentials to you and convey to you the friendship and importance that the government and people of my country attach to the Republic of China. It is an honor for our two countries to have a long-standing relationship of mutual trust. Recently, the governments of our two countries have mutually upgraded the level of diplomatic missions, which is sufficient proof of our mutual desire to promote friendly relations. I feel honored to have been appointed as the first ambassador of my country to China. I am deeply aware of the importance of this position, which is comforting to you. The previous Minister Wei has maintained the friendly relations between our two countries with unwavering loyalty until his last breath. In the future, I will certainly follow the old example and continue to work hard to ensure that our two countries achieve effective and sincere cooperation in all aspects, as should be the case between countries like ours with thousands of years of noble culture, a deep understanding of their national status, and a love of peace and the arts. I have been stationed in China for many years and deeply admire the virtues of the Chinese people. I have also made many sincere friends in your country. I am very happy to be back in your country and will do my best to fulfill my mission. I am confident that you and the National Government will provide the assistance and trust I need in my work.

I am particularly pleased to hear the friendly sentiments of your government and people, which you have just expressed. The relationship between China and France has been harmonious for many years, and the National Government will certainly work hard to maintain it. I hope you will convey this. The upgrading of diplomatic missions between the two countries is sufficient proof of the sincerity of our mutual friendship and trust and the consolidation of our friendly relations. The fact that your government has selected someone so capable for this new position is a clear indication of this. Your Excellency has traveled to China many times and is familiar with the customs and culture of the Chinese people. By being stationed in this country, you will be able to fulfill your duties as you wish and further strengthen the long-standing friendship between our two countries. As you return to your old home, and your circle of friends is wide, I extend a special welcome to you. The National Government will also always provide friendly and effective assistance so that your noble mission can be accomplished. (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The United States and the Philippines: Murphy Advocates Restoring Protector Status</h3>
<p>(Washington) The United States High Commissioner to the Philippines, Murphy, met with reporters today and still made no statement as to whether he would be a candidate for Governor of Michigan. He stated that even if he decided to run, he would spend at least another six weeks dealing with the Philippine issue. According to reliable sources, if Murphy resigns as High Commissioner to the Philippines, it is recommended that the acting commissioner, Jones, succeed him. Murphy held several meetings with government officials today, strongly advocating that the United States should restore the concept of being a trustee for the Philippines. Current discussions in political circles are all dominated by self-serving commercial attitudes. Therefore, if the United States wants to maintain its reputation in the eyes of Asian countries, it should give the Philippines the fairest treatment. Murphy is now trying to promote preparatory talks for a Philippine-US economic conference by mid-November at the latest so that the details of Philippine-US commercial relations can be studied in detail, providing a solid basis for the formal conference next year. Murphy believes that US commercial policy must be developed beyond the autonomous period, otherwise it will inevitably be delayed until the Philippines is formally independent. Officials are quite moved by Murphy's sincere attitude, so whether Murphy resigns or not, he will remain the central figure in US-Philippine trade issues. (8th Nationalist Dispatch)</p>

<h3>British Government Announces Again: Additional Defense Expenditures Increased to a Total of 190 Million Pounds; Army, Navy, and Air Force All Significantly Expanded</h3>
<p>(London) The authorities today announced additional estimates for the army and air force, stating that Britain's rearmament plan will be accelerated. Naval estimates have already been supplemented. The new estimates will increase this year's defense expenditures to approximately 190 million pounds.</p>
<p>According to the Secretary of State for Air, the construction projects for air force stations approved by Parliament are proceeding rapidly and exceeding expectations. The estimates stipulate the establishment of aircraft manufacturing plants during the current air force expansion period, which will serve as supply sources in wartime.</p>
<p>The army estimates stipulate the purchase of one million pounds worth of machinery and tools and two and a half million pounds worth of military supplies. It is noted that since the start of the Italo-Ethiopian War, the War Office has spent 1.25 million pounds.</p>
<p>The additional air force estimates stipulate the purchase of five million pounds worth of aircraft and air force supplies, 1.5 million pounds worth of weapons and ammunition, and two million pounds for ground construction.</p>
<p>The total additional estimates amount to £19,359,000, including £1,059,000 for the Navy, £6,600,000 for the Army, £11,700,000 for the Air Force, and £293,000 for arsenals. The Air Force's strength will be increased by 5,000 aircraft, bringing the total number of aircraft to 55,000. The additional army estimates include plans to rectify the army's shortcomings and special plans related to the Italo-Ethiopian War and the disturbances in Palestine.</p>
<p>According to the air force budget submitted to Parliament in March of this year, the expenditure was 39 million pounds. The budget proposal stipulated that the three national defense expenditures for the Navy, Army, and Air Force were 158,251,000 pounds. An additional naval estimate of 10.3 million pounds was approved by Parliament after the budget proposal was passed. (Reuter, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the second addition to the naval budget, First Lord of the Admiralty Hoare issued a statement today, stating that the government has now decided to add more warships and expedite their completion, making an additional naval budget necessary. The additional national defense budget announced by the government this morning is divided into three parts: the Navy, Army, and Air Force, as follows:</p>
<p>The additional naval budget, totaling £1,059,000, is used to build two 5,000-ton cruisers, one flotilla leader, eight destroyers, one aircraft carrier, and four submarines. The additional army budget, totaling £6,600,000, will be explained by the Army Council, which believes that the British Army should be modernized after the successive occurrences of the Italo-Ethiopian War and the disturbances in Palestine.</p>
<p>The additional air force budget, totaling £11,700,000, will be used to increase the air force personnel from 50,000 to 55,000, and to add twelve overseas air squadrons to be stationed at major air force bases throughout the British Empire, ensuring that the first line of defense aircraft is increased to 1,750 aircraft before March 31 of next year. In addition, new air force bases will be added in five locations: Linton-on-Ouse, Tholleson, Honington, Scampton, and Morely. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) According to responsible sources here today, regardless of whether the US government installs 16-inch diameter guns on its two new battleships, Britain has decided to equip the two 35,000-ton battleships to be built with 14-inch caliber guns. The reason is that battleships for the Far East must be different from those for Europe. European battleships all comply with the 14-inch caliber gun position regulations. (Reuter, 9th)</p>
<h3>Britain Plans to Withdraw Home Fleet From the Mediterranean</h3>
<p>But Mediterranean Fleet Stronger Than Before</p>
<p>(London) After the outbreak of the Italo-Ethiopian War, the British government previously transferred a portion of the Home Fleet to the Mediterranean for stationing. Responsible sources have revealed that the government intends to withdraw this fleet back to the country, so that the naval personnel in the Mediterranean can be reduced to the "usual" number. However, in practical terms, the number of naval personnel in the Mediterranean is still higher than the original number before the outbreak of the war between Italy and Ethiopia, and the tonnage has also increased accordingly. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) Responsible sources here announced today that the British fleet concentrated in the Mediterranean may soon be reduced to normal. The Home Fleet detachment currently concentrated in Gibraltar will soon sail back to the country, and the Far East Fleet concentrated in the Mediterranean will also begin to sail back to the Far East. It is recalled that Foreign Secretary Eden recently declared in the House of Commons that Britain will forever maintain its defense position in the Mediterranean, even stronger than before the Italo-Ethiopian War. According to a Reuter report from Rome, Italian political circles are extremely satisfied with Britain's immediate reduction of its fleet in the Mediterranean, which can be taken as the first step towards finally resolving the Anglo-Italian disputes caused by Britain's attitude towards Mussolini's "expansion of colonial expeditions." Responsible sources in Rome also recalled Mussolini's recent remarks, namely, "Once the British government withdraws its fleet from the Mediterranean, Italy will recall the extra troops sent to Libya." (Reuter, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) Although the government authorities have decided to withdraw the Home Fleet from the Mediterranean back to the Home waters, the exact timing of the withdrawal has not yet been disclosed. Naval sources have stated that the implementation of this measure is not far off. The fleet that the government intends to withdraw includes: The Home Fleet stationed in the Strait of Gibraltar, whose personnel have served for a long time, should be granted leave, and the ships should be docked for repairs. A number of ships from the China Fleet have already been withdrawn to the country. The West Indies Fleet. The ships stationed in New Zealand, as well as the cruisers "Australia" and "Sydney" belonging to the Australian Fleet. After that, the number of personnel in the Mediterranean Fleet should be reduced to the original number before the outbreak of the Italian-Ethiopian conflict, but the total tonnage should be gradually increased. This is the proposition of Foreign Secretary Eden's speech to the House of Commons on the 18th of last month, namely, "Britain must maintain a defensive posture in the Mediterranean, but its strength must be greater than it was before the outbreak of the Italian-Ethiopian conflict." In addition, naval sources also stated that the composition of the Mediterranean Fleet thereafter has not yet been decided at this time, but the Queen Elizabeth-class battleships (note that these battleships have a displacement of 31,000 tons and a gun caliber of 15 inches) and all of Britain's existing battlecruisers may be included. As for how to allocate destroyers and submarines, nothing has been heard. It is noted that Britain currently has five 31,000-ton battleships, all belonging to the Queen Elizabeth class, including the "Barham," "Queen Elizabeth," "Valiant," and "Warspite," all belonging to the Mediterranean Fleet. In addition, there is one ship, the "Malaya," belonging to the Malay Fleet. There are three battlecruisers in total, one being the "Hood" (42,000 tons), one being the "Renown" (32,000 tons), and one being the "Repulse" (32,000 tons). (Havas, 9th)</p>

<h3>Montreux Conference: Turkey Opposes the Establishment of a Straits Management Committee</h3>
<p>Believes It Violates the Sovereignty of an Independent Country; the Issue of Opening the Black Sea is Temporarily Shelved</p>
<p>Montreux After the meeting of the Dardanelles Straits Commission yesterday, it was decided to postpone the discussion of the difficult issue of warships entering and leaving the straits in wartime. However, a new setback has now occurred in the conference, as Britain has proposed retaining the Straits Management Committee, which Turkey opposes because it is detrimental to its national prestige. The Balkan countries all support it. The Soviet Union is silent on this, with only France supporting Britain. Turkey has proposed replacing the committee with a consular corps. (Reuter, 9th)</p>
<p>Montreux The Montreux Conference reconvened in plenary session this morning. Due to the various difficulties caused by Article 16 of the British amendment (namely, the advocacy of opening the Black Sea in wartime), the representatives of the countries have not yet reached an agreement, so it was decided to discuss Articles 17 and 18 of the amendment. Article 17 stipulates that if Turkey is one of the belligerent countries, it may close the Dardanelles and Bosporus Straits. Article 18 stipulates that if Turkey believes that its security is threatened, it may close the straits, but it should notify the signatory countries and the Administrative Council of the League of Nations of the details of the threat. However, due to a request for temporary reservation by the Japanese delegation in order to seek instructions from the government of that country, no decision could be made. Then, the issue of civilian and military aircraft of various countries flying over the straits was discussed. Regarding this level, the Turkish original draft advocated that it should be prohibited regardless of whether it flies over territorial borders. French representative Peng Gu and British Lord Stanley immediately expressed their views, saying that this level was too harsh. Turkish Foreign Minister Rushdi also issued a statement, saying that an amendment would be proposed, advocating that although aircraft from various countries may pass through the straits, they must not cross the fortified zone. At this time, the General Assembly decided that it would discuss this issue again when Turkey officially proposed this amendment. The General Assembly finally discussed the issue of the survival or abolition of the Straits International Committee. The Turkish original draft advocated that it should be abolished immediately. Romania, Bulgaria, and Greece all expressed their support for this. Representatives from Britain and France believe that if this committee can be retained, it will be beneficial to compiling ship entry and exit statistics and assisting the Turkish government. Other national delegations have proposed compromise proposals, advocating that the Turkish government should always cooperate with the consuls of the countries concerned to discuss the results, but no decision has been made. The General Assembly then decided to continue to hold a plenary session this afternoon. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>Montreux In the Montreux Conference, the Soviet Union advocated prohibiting warships of belligerent countries from entering and leaving the Dardanelles Strait, except when fulfilling the obligations of the League of Nations Treaty. France is now backing the Soviet Union. French Chief Representative Peng Gu is currently drafting a compromise amendment, advocating that Soviet warships also have the right to enter and leave the Black Sea under the regional agreements and mutual assistance agreements formed within the League of Nations Treaty organization. The Montreux Conference is in danger of breaking down due to differences between British and Russian opinions, but after Litvinov and British Chief Representative Stanley met yesterday afternoon, there has been a slight turning point. They talked for an hour and a half, and the result will be mutual concessions in order to seek a compromised solution. Li recognized that he had received instructions from his government, and if he was not satisfied with certain points, he planned to pack his bags and return home. In addition, the Soviet Union and Turkey also had disputes on certain points, which made the future of the conference dim, but after Romanian representative Titulescu's mediation, both sides reached an understanding. (Reuter, 9th)</p>
<p>Montreux Regarding the issue of opening the Black Sea in wartime, the opinions of Britain and Russia differ, and even after French Chief Representative Peng Gu mediated, no solution has been reached. Peng Gu has now decided to propose an amendment to Article 16 of the British draft, which advocates that the Black Sea should continue to be open in wartime, at the conference tomorrow morning in the hope of establishing a compromise solution. He held talks with Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu, Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov, and British Chief Representative Lord Stanley this afternoon, serving as a mediator between Britain and Russia. When he met with Lord Stanley, he stated that since the Soviet Union and Romania have requested the right to freely enter and leave the Black Sea, France should also request to obtain this right, so that when a war occurs, it can join the Black Sea coastal countries to fulfill the obligations stipulated by international obligations and regional covenants. Lord Stanley immediately asked Peng Gu to draft the provisions, taking into account the interests of all parties concerned, and submit them to the conference for discussion. In addition, Litvinov also held private talks with representatives of several countries this afternoon, explaining the requirements proposed by the Soviet Union, namely: The right to freely enter and leave the Black Sea; Closing the Black Sea in wartime in order to prevent attacks from countries not bordering the Black Sea, and said that he had received strict orders from the government and must insist on this requirement. Litvinov also met with British Chief Representative Lord Stanley, but because Stanley had not yet received instructions from the government, the above issue was not mentioned. The Montreux Conference has now been scheduled to meet at 10:00 tomorrow morning to continue discussing Article 16 of the British draft. If the representatives of the countries have not yet received instructions by then, the discussion should be postponed, and the duration of the conference may be extended. It is not yet certain.

<p>Warsaw Polish High Commissioner to the Free City of Danzig, Babe, visited Danzig Senate President Greiser today and issued a statement, saying that the Polish government cannot tolerate any unilateral actions that would change the city's status quo or harm Poland's commercial relations with the city.

<p>(Paris) Foreign Minister Delbos met with the new Polish Ambassador, Lukasiewicz, this evening to discuss the Danzig issue. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(London) Since Danzig Senate President Greiser returned to the Free City, the overall situation in Danzig has been calm, but the British government still holds a serious view. Yesterday, it was learned that German Air Minister Goering had recently become involved in the Danzig dispute and discussed everything with Polish Ambassador to Berlin, Lipski. Lipski explained Poland's position to him. Today, details of a conversation between British Ambassador to Berlin, Newton, and German Foreign Ministry official, Dieckhoff, were learned, stating that Dieckhoff stated that Germany was ultimately dissatisfied with the governance system of the Free City of Danzig, but was determined not to take actions that would be considered direct interference in Danzig's affairs. Dieckhoff did not deny the rumors that Greiser had received orders from Berlin to remain as the Chairman of the Danzig Administration. There is no doubt that Greiser's actions at the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting were instructed by Berlin. (Reuter, 9th)</p>
<h3>Germany Expresses That It Will Not Submit a Reply to the British Question List for the Time Being</h3>
<p>Nor Will It Participate in the Locarno Conference</p>
<p>(London) The Locarno Pact countries will meet in Beijing. According to reliable information today, Germany has notified Britain, stating that it does not wish to participate in this meeting. This matter was notified by German Foreign Minister Neurath to the British Chargé d'affaires in Germany, Newton, on Tuesday. The German Foreign Minister said that Germany believed that it was not appropriate to convene a meeting of the Locarno Pact countries at this time, so it had no intention of sending representatives to attend, but if Italy could participate, it would be another matter. The German Foreign Minister also said that Germany did not intend to reply to the list of questions raised by Britain on May 6 for the time being, because European disputes were so severe that it would be unwise to reply even if it wanted to.

<p>Draft Agreement Already Negotiated With France</p>
<p>(Paris) Delegations from Syria and Lebanon, French mandate territories, recently came here to negotiate with the Foreign Ministry authorities on the merger of the two places into one independent republic and the signing of an alliance treaty with France.

After the mandate system is revoked, France will be responsible for handling the national defense affairs of the Republic of Lebanon in order to protect its security. France will send an ambassador to the country, and the country will station a minister in Paris. This draft shall be submitted to the League of Nations Mandate Territory Committee for approval before it can be implemented. (Havas, 8th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) On the morning of the 9th, the Central Government and the National Government held a ceremony to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the Northern Expedition Pledge. Chairman Chiang's address was as follows: "Fellow officers, soldiers, and students, today, ten years ago, on July 9th, 1926, we held the Northern Expedition Pledge ceremony in Guangzhou. All of our armed comrades in the North, Southwest, and Guangdong regions accepted the Party's mandate, united as one, and strived, fought, and sacrificed to realize the Three Principles of the People of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen. At the same time, all the seniors and comrades in the Party also worked together to guide and struggle. Due to this united effort, we finally completed the mission of the Northern Expedition, achieved national unification, and laid the foundation for the revolution. Today, we are able to hold this solemn and grand ceremony commemorating the tenth anniversary of the Northern Expedition Pledge in the capital, where the mausoleum of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen is located. Everyone must know that this is no ordinary event. Today is truly the most glorious commemorative day for all of our officers, soldiers, party comrades, and compatriots across the country; it is the most important commemorative day for the National Revolution. As we approach this great commemorative day, we feel very honored on the one hand, and on the other hand, we must also remember that the late Premier, who led our revolution, has already passed away. The general officers and soldiers who shared our hardships and lived and died with us, one after another, those who died and those who were wounded, already number more than 300,000. The number of other comrades and compatriots who were wounded or killed for the revolution is even more immeasurable. When we think about these past ten years, how much blood and sweat our general officers, soldiers, comrades, and compatriots have shed for the revolution, for the cause, and for the country, and how many lives have been sacrificed! Today, all the armed comrades across the country, both present and absent, must make extra efforts to strive, to realize the Three Principles of the People, and to fulfill the legacy of our late Premier and the general officers and soldiers who have already died. This year is the 25th year of the Republic of China. By the 35th year of the Republic of China, we must hold a grand ceremony to celebrate the completion of the second phase of the National Revolution. I hope that all armed comrades, as well as all party comrades and compatriots across the country, will hold firmly to this goal, unite sincerely, and work together to intensify our efforts to complete the great revolutionary cause of the next ten years. All officers and soldiers and students who are being inspected today must know that if we want to complete the National Revolution and build the Republic of China, we must have a sound revolutionary armed force. The so-called sound revolutionary armed force must not only have sophisticated weapons, but must also have sound revolutionary soldiers who are capable of using weapons. In other words, all of our general officers and soldiers must have noble spirits and morals, that is, we must follow the instructions of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen, to restore China's inherent morality, to promote the revolutionary spirit, in order to enrich the revolutionary armed force, to achieve the goal of building the country and revitalizing the nation. Now, after the completion of the review parade, I will specially announce the Ten Articles of Reading Instructions for Soldiers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, which embody the inherent moral spirit of China. After everyone follows the recitation, you must always earnestly abide by them. (The following was promulgated and read by Chairman Chiang, article by article, and the entire audience recited along with him in unison.) The Ten Articles of Reading Instructions for Soldiers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force of the Republic of China: Article 1: Implement the Three Principles of the People and defend the nation, and allow no acts of violation or negligence. Article 2: Support the National Government and obey superiors, and allow no acts of hypocrisy or betrayal. Article 3: Respect and love comrades-in-arms and protect the people, and allow no acts of arrogance or rudeness. Article 4: Be loyal to one's duties and carry out orders, and allow no acts of delay or cowardice.

<h3>Japanese Actively Develop Rare Products of Rehe</h3>
<p>Output is abundant, similar to local specialties and curiosities of various counties near Koshu in Japan, totaling over two hundred thousand.</p>
<p>Chengde Dispatch: The topography and composition of Rehe Province are originally complex mountains and waters, and its local products, rare objects, and hot spring eruptions are all unique compared to other provinces. According to Japanese investigations, the state of Rehe's special products is generally similar to that of Koshu in Japan. The production of crystals, many mountains, the habitat of monkeys, and the production of rare items are very similar. In addition, there are many famous mountains near Koshu in Japan, and the neighboring area of Rehe Province also has the famous mountain Lushun. Furthermore, the Japanese are actively promoting the development of special industries in the secret regions of Rehe Province, such as processed crystal agate, etc., and are concurrently developing the scenic spot of Chengde. The Japanese are also referencing the utilization of mountainous areas near Koshu in Japan, setting up weirs, and developing electrification. In terms of industry, Koshu silk is worth 10 million yen, Eishō 500,000 yen, grapes 1 million yen, and wine 400,000 yen, etc., which are quite abundant.

<h3>Smuggled Goods Arrive in Luyi</h3>
<p>Inspection office in Jinan seizes a train car of white sugar.</p>
<p>Jinan dispatch: Smuggling in North China has not stopped. Although relevant parties have repeatedly negotiated, there has been no way to stop it for more than a month. There is hardly a day without smuggled goods being transported from Tianjin to Jinan. This morning (7th), the 77th mixed train arriving in Jinan also had a car of untaxed white sugar, weighing about 30 tons, transported to Jinan via the Beining Railway joint transport, attempting to transport it to Qingdao via the Jiaoji Railway. After arriving in Jinan, it was seized by the Customs Anti-Smuggling Inspection Office. The ronin transporting the smuggled goods negotiated with the inspection office to transport the goods eastward, but were rejected. The goods were detained in the Jinan freight yard. The ronin, unable to negotiate, stayed at the inspection office. The Jinpu Railway Police Section, fearing further conflicts, sent police to the scene to maintain order. The outcome is still unknown. Li Tonghua, deputy director of the inspection office, went to Tianjin to negotiate with relevant parties a few days ago and returned to Jinan last night. It is said that he still did not get any concession.</p>
<p>Also, at 9:47 a.m. on the 7th, the 305th Pingpu express train arriving in Jinan also transported 183 pieces of smuggled goods, including 100 bags of white sugar, 79 bags of rayon, and 4 bags of cigarette paper, all taken away by the smugglers.</p>
<h3>Japan Increases Troops and Immigrants in Manchuria</h3>
<p>Increasing troops to defend against enemies is an urgent plan, and the immigration policy has two major effects.</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reported from Dalian on July 2nd: "How will Japanese military leaders cope with the three major urgent problems Japan faces in Manchuria?" The general public is now speculating. The so-called three problems are: 1. Greatly increasing the number of Japanese troops stationed in Manchuria; 2. Moving millions of Japanese people to Manchuria from Japan; 3. Encouraging Japanese investment in Manchuria. It is generally believed that Lieutenant General Itagaki, Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, and senior military officers of the Central Army in Tokyo have reached an agreement on these three matters. News from Changchun also confirms this.</p>
<p>The transformation of the Kwantung Army to enable it to defend every inch of land in the puppet state of Manchuria against any powerful enemy army is regarded as an urgent plan by the Japanese here. If the Soviet Russian Far East Army continues to flaunt its power along the northeastern and western borders of the puppet state of Manchuria, the Japanese in Manchuria will never be able to rest easy for a day. According to a certain colonel of the Kwantung Army staff, although the final plan to strengthen the Kwantung Army has not been submitted to this session of the Diet, the Hirota cabinet will sooner or later implement it. As for the funds required for increasing troops in Manchuria, they will probably be included in the budget proposal for 1937-1938. It is said that this funding will be part of the six-year national defense program considered by the Central Army authorities in Tokyo. According to unconfirmed rumors, the Central Army authorities are now proposing a program requiring 200 million yen. As for whether this plan supports converting the Kwantung Army into a regular army, it is not yet known. It is currently believed here that the Central Army authorities' preparation to support the strengthening of the Kwantung Army has been clearly expressed by Army Minister Count Terauchi in the Diet. The Army Minister reiterated his reasons as follows: 1. Recently, the attitude of Soviet Russia has indeed been aggressive; 2. Soviet Russian troops are being continuously mobilized and stockpiled with large quantities of military equipment along the Russian-Manchurian border; 3. Soviet Russia is now planning to strategically encircle "Manchukuo."</p>
<p>The success of the colonial plan and the increased investment of Japanese people in Manchuria are generally believed to be foreshadowed by the strength of the Kwantung Army. Therefore, the people here now eagerly want to know to what extent the authorities are willing to guarantee the security of "Manchukuo." Lieutenant General Itagaki's announcement that he would recruit millions of Japanese people to immigrate to Manchuria has aroused discussions in all quarters. The Japanese here naturally support this move. It is said that this plan will involve Manchuria absorbing one million Japanese people every year. According to Lieutenant General Itagaki, this move can be achieved by relocating the entire residents of several villages. This great immigration proposal will not only help solve Japan's terrible population problem but will also be a clever means for the military authorities to achieve their grand plans. Because once one million people leave their home countries and come to the new land of Manchuria every year, the national defense problem can naturally be gradually alleviated and eventually solved. Indeed, the latent power of these civilians will surely be able to protect themselves and the land entrusted to their care. At the same time, the Japanization of "Manchukuo" can also be completed as a result.</p>
<h3>Former President of the Guangdong Provincial Bank, Cheng Tiandou, Assassinated in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Shot three times and died immediately, rumors of political motives behind the death.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Dispatch: Cheng Tiandou, former president of the Guangdong Provincial Bank (during the Chen Jiongming era), was recently assassinated in Hong Kong. Cheng, a native of Zhongshan, possessed huge wealth after leaving the political arena in Guangdong and lived as a recluse in Hong Kong. He built a mansion at No. 51 Robinson Road. The mansion has several buildings in a row, and Cheng lived in one of them, while the others were rented to foreigners. The place is quiet. Cheng has been extremely cautious about his comings and goings recently, always returning home early or late. On the 4th of this month, Cheng returned to his residence by his own car at 6 p.m. When the car reached the intersection in front of his house, it stopped. He then climbed the stone steps to enter the gate. As soon as he stepped on the stone steps, he suddenly encountered an assassin coming towards him, who approached and fired three shots at Cheng. Cheng fell to the ground immediately, lying in a pool of blood. Cheng's family members heard the gunshots and opened the door to check. At this time, Cheng had already fallen to the ground, covered in blood. They quickly wrapped his body in a blanket and stroked his chest. He was still slightly warm. They hurriedly ordered the driver to send Cheng to the National Hospital for treatment. However, after being admitted to the hospital, his limbs were already cold. He opened his mouth to speak, but could only utter inarticulate sounds. After a while, his breath was gone. His wife cried bitterly beside him. Then, the doctor examined Cheng's remains and held a funeral in the hospital. Afterwards, Hong Kong police and detectives went to the scene of the incident to investigate. They found a straw hat full of bloody blood at the scene of the murder. They then inquired with nearby residents. A guest at No. 60 said that he suddenly heard three gunshots outside while having dinner that day. Looking out from the balcony, he saw a man, about thirty years old, wearing a white short shirt and trousers, looking panicked, descending the stone steps and fleeing eastward. This person must be the murderer. It is reported that the reason for Cheng's immediate death was that all three bullets hit vital points, one in the throat, one in the chest, and one in the right shoulder. Cheng left behind a wife, two sons, four daughters, and a mother in her nineties. He left behind a considerable estate. After the incident, the Hong Kong Police Commissioner has dispatched detectives to investigate the murderer and offered a reward of 250 yuan to apprehend him for interrogation. As for the reason for Cheng's assassination, it is rumored to be related to politics. (July 7th)</p>

<h3>Dispute over Increased Slaughter Tax in Shanyang</h3>
<p>There are a total of five meat merchants in Shanyang, and their businesses are roughly the same, but the assessed tax amounts vary greatly. Gu Yuanda's tax amount is the largest, and Tongsheng's is the smallest. They all feel that the treatment is unfair and are seeking relief. The slaughter tax bureau has increased the tax by 20%, but the merchants are unable to bear it due to the poor market conditions. They have petitioned the county government for relief. The bureau sent staff to the town the night before to notify the shops to collect taxes per head. The merchants requested that the tax collection method not be changed because the situation in this town is different, but the bureau refused. It is heard that the two sides are at loggerheads over this issue, and it is unknown how it will be resolved.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Seizes Smuggled Goods Amidst Anti-Smuggling Efforts</h3>
<p>All sectors of Wuxian County are working hard to prevent smuggling. The anti-smuggling committees organized by various industries were officially established on the 9th and held their first meeting. Xue Yongling, Xu Xiaozhai, Zhu Jingbo, Mo Jingyong, and Shen Ruihe were elected as standing members, with Xue Yongling as chairman. Staff members of various groups were also appointed, and simplified rules of procedure and covenants were passed. The Suzhou Customs recently seized a large batch of smuggled rayon worth more than 2,000 yuan, which is currently being detained by the Suzhou Customs. As for its disposal, it has been submitted to the ministry for instructions on the 9th.</p>
<h3>Telegrams Opposing Income Tax</h3>
<p>The Wuxian County Chamber of Commerce believes that the people will not be able to bear the government's planned income tax. Yesterday (9th), it sent telegrams to the chambers of commerce of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Jiangxi, Shandong, and Peiping, Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Hankou, Guangzhou and other provinces and cities, stating: "Reports state that the provisional regulations on income tax are awaiting revision and implementation. According to the draft's principle of light taxation, it is divided into three categories. However, since the implementation of the business tax for various shops, it has been suddenly increased or estimated. The tax rate is increasing day by day, and business is decreasing day by day. Repeated sales involve multiple taxes. Merchants are unable to support themselves, and bankruptcies are frequently heard. The pain is deep, and there are no tears to cry. Yet, the officials in charge are not thinking about recuperating and restoring the people's strength, but are instead imposing taxes on income and strictly defining the laws of punishment in order to achieve their selfish desires. At this time before the promulgation, we are sending a telegram to express our views and to urge the authorities to appeal as a whole to postpone the implementation of the income tax case and give us a chance to breathe, given the poverty and exhaustion of the people." At the same time, an urgent telegram was sent to the Shanghai National Federation of Chambers of Commerce and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating: "The income tax case is about to be passed and implemented, which affects the people's livelihood and business strength, and the public is panicking. In addition to the detailed proxy telegram, please quickly telegraph the authorities to appeal and express your views. We are in urgent need." Signed: Qing, Wuxian Chamber of Commerce.</p>

She remained chaste for five years, but never gave birth. Suspecting it was bloating disease, she sought medical treatment a few days ago. Unexpectedly, with a cry, a boy was suddenly born. The child had regular features and a loud cry. Chen could not help but be shocked because giving birth to a child as a widow was a matter of face. She planned to kill the child. The child immediately turned over and kowtowed to her, crying mournfully. Seeing this, Chen also felt heartbroken and could not bear it. However, giving birth to a child as a widow would inevitably cause criticism, so she gritted her teeth and decided to beat the child to death to preserve her chastity. Unexpectedly, suddenly a giant snake more than ten feet long coiled to the doorway, raised its head and stuck out its tongue, intending to devour people. At that time, Chen and her family members were terrified, but the newborn child stopped crying. Chen's mother then put her hands together, kowtowed and prayed, vowing to raise the newborn child. The snake then slithered away. The incident caused a sensation in the neighborhood, and everyone was amazed. Teahouses and wine shops used it as a topic of conversation. Chen, having been frightened after giving birth, fell ill and was bedridden. The child is now being raised by a wet nurse hired by the Baojia chief Sun's family, and he is fat and cute.</p>

<h3>Yangzhou Detectives Disguised and Capture Bandit Leader</h3>
<p>Wang Depu, the Security Commander of the Seventh District of Jiangsu, has been offering a reward for the capture of the notorious bandit leader Zhao Erdeng. He has also imprisoned the Baojia chief and the bandit's family members in shackles. For more than half a year, he has not been captured. According to the report, the bandit leader was hiding in a shanty town in the old city of Jiangdu. Detective Lin Zongmei was dispatched to bring a soldier and the Baojia chief as an informant to Yang to investigate and arrest him according to the address. Today (7th) afternoon, the detective had disguised himself and arrived here as ordered. Unexpectedly, the bandit leader had already fled after hearing the news. They immediately tracked him down and chased him. Near the Longtouguan Alley in the new city, they saw the bandit leader carrying a package on his back, looking panicked, and running for his life. The detective immediately rushed up and arrested him. He immediately went to the county government to submit a document for detention, adding shackles and chains, in preparation for escorting him to the department for punishment.</p>

The county now intends to change the plan. The Construction Department believes that the riverbed at that location is very deep, always 8 to 10 meters below the lowest water level, and the proposed plan is not applicable. It immediately ordered that funds be raised and built according to the plan of the Water Conservancy Bureau as an important project.</p>

<h3>Our Country's Salt Problem (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Zhu Tiren, Director of the Salt Administration, Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>Thirdly, speaking of salt distribution, the current distribution system can be roughly divided into five types: The first type is the free system, which is currently implemented in several provinces and regions including Huaibei, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Koubei, as well as the upstream counties of Fujian, the provincial river, Chaozhou, and Meizhou districts of Guangdong, Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Chuzhou of Zhejiang, Ruguang Gongmeng of Henan, Western Hubei, the Yu'an and Shan'an regions of Hedong, and the eastern regions of Shandong. In this system, anyone in the opened areas, whether salt merchants or ordinary people, can freely transport salt after reporting. The second type is the exclusive merchant system, which is currently used by the lead merchants and ticket merchants in the four banks of Hunan, Hubei, Western Hunan, and Anhui, Huainan, Liangzhe, Songjiang, Changlu, and Shandong. In this system, only exclusive merchants with lead tickets have the qualifications to transport salt. The third type is the contracted merchant system, which is currently implemented in Shaoxing and Xiaoshan of Eastern Zhejiang, the Shanghai Concession of Songjiang, Southern Fujian, Lei, Qiong, and En, Kai, Xin, and Yang prefectures of Guangdong, Yongqi and Jinwu of Changlu, and the sixty-one counties of the former official transport system, and the border banks of Southern Hunan. This system involves designating regions and recruiting merchants to handle transportation, allowing merchants to have exclusive transportation rights within a specified period. The fourth type is the leased merchant system, which is currently implemented in the five counties of Jianchang in Western Anhui, Chu, Lai, Quan in Anhui, and the leased counties in Shandong. This system is similar to the contracted merchant system, but the lease period is shorter. The fifth type is the official transport system, which is currently only implemented in the upstream counties of Fujian, alongside the free system. From a legal perspective, among the above distribution systems, only the free system should naturally be promoted. However, considering the current situation, absolute freedom cannot be implemented yet, and only limited freedom can be adopted. As for the national salt sales volume, it was over 41.7 million market dan in the 21st year of the Republic, over 42.5 million market dan in the 22nd year, and 42.8 million market dan in the 23rd year. Refined salt is not included. In recent years, the salt sales volume has been lower than before. The most important reason for the decrease is the economic decline in rural areas and financial panic, which has reduced people's purchasing power. Heavy taxes and changes in weighing methods also have some impact. Regarding reducing the cost of salt, the production aspect has already been discussed above. At the same time, the government is also trying to reduce the cost of salt transportation, such as promoting transportation by steamship, which is a way to reduce freight costs. Salt transportation on the four banks of Hunan, Hubei, Western Hunan, and Anhui has historically relied on sailing, which is expensive, time-consuming, and causes significant brine loss. In addition, boatmen secretly sell salt along the way, all of which increase the cost of salt. If steamships are used to transport salt, both expenses and time can be saved, and the loss can also be reduced. In this way, the cost of salt can be reduced, and the sales volume of salt can be increased. Moreover, the government is now promoting the use of salt in industry, charging only a light tax of three cents per dan. Many emerging domestic industries, especially the chemical industry, require salt as a raw material. If it can be fully utilized, the total amount of salt sold can naturally be increased.</p>
<p>Fourthly, speaking of salt tax, salt tax is a general tax, and the principle should be a relatively light tax rate. The salt taxes of Eastern and Western countries are lighter than China's salt tax, and some even do not collect salt tax. However, in the past in China, each province acted on its own, and there were many surcharges. Although the salt tax is now collected centrally by the central government, the amount of money allocated to the provinces from the salt tax each year is also considerable. Given the current state of the national treasury's revenue and expenditure, it is not easy to talk about a no-tax policy for the time being. However, the salt taxes in various provinces and regions vary greatly, with the highest being ten yuan per dan and the lowest being only one yuan or several jiao per dan. The difference is too large. Over the years, efforts have been repeatedly made to reorganize it, slightly increasing the tax rate in low-tax areas and appropriately reducing the tax rate in high-tax areas. For example, in the 23rd year of the Republic, the tax rate was reduced in the three banks of Hunan, Hubei, and Western Hunan, with some reductions as high as three yuan per dan. On the one hand, this was to avoid the drawbacks of low-tax salt flooding into high-tax areas, and on the other hand, it was to equalize the burden on the people. In the 21st year of the Republic, the total salt tax collected was over 153 million yuan, in the 22nd year it was over 170 million yuan, and in the 23rd year it was over 173.4 million yuan. Each year, it ranks second in national tax revenue (the first being customs duties). I remember that during the opening of the Second National Financial Conference, President Wang said in his speech: "We often have two conflicting feelings. On the one hand, we hope that the financial situation is good and that we can collect more money to do more things. On the other hand, we feel that our country has suffered from natural disasters and man-made calamities for years, and an increase in national tax revenue means an increased burden on the people, which is really a bit unbearable." My own opinion on salt tax can be represented by these few words.</p>
<p>The above has roughly explained the history of salt, the production of salt, the distribution of salt, and the tax on salt. In addition, there is one more point that needs to be added, which is the future trend of salt affairs. The new salt law was promulgated on May 5th, the 25th year of the Republic. Its spirit emphasizes the collection of taxes at the production site. This is the new system established by the government. However, when a country changes a system, there will inevitably be difficulties, setbacks, and impacts, both directly and indirectly. We must find ways to solve the problems and resistance and move forward, so that the national salt affairs can get on the normal track as soon as possible, and the national tax revenue can be more stable. At the same time, the problem of facilitating the people's food supply can be solved accordingly. I think this should not be just the hope of one person; everyone who cares about salt affairs must have the same hope. (End)</p>

<h3>Swearing-in Ceremony to Commemorate the Northern Expedition Held by City Party Headquarters Yesterday</h3>
<p>Over 200 Representatives from All Walks of Life Attended, City-Wide Flag Displayed for One Day with Strict Security</p>
<p>The city party headquarters convened representatives from all walks of life in the city at 10 a.m. yesterday to hold a ceremony commemorating the tenth anniversary of the swearing-in of the National Revolutionary Army for the Northern Expedition. The attendees included Wang Ruzhong from the Shanghai branch of the Central Cotton Adulteration and Impurity Elimination Office, Du Mengsen from the Cooperative Business Promotion Association, Long Peiyun from the General Labor Union, Huang Kegui from the Education Association, Cui Zixin from the Association for Cherishing Written Characters, Lin Kecong from the Women's Association, Shui Xiangyun from the Chinese Labor Association, Zhao Zhenhui from the Pharmaceutical Industry Union, Gong Jingyan from the Second Special District City Federation, Tan Gengxin from the Shanghai Audit Office of the Audit Department, Zhang Yichen from the First Special District City Federation, Hu Shouqi from the Changzhou Fellow Villagers Association, Xiao Huiqing from the City Farmers Association, Song Shide from the Chinese National Products Preservation Association, and over 200 others, presided over by Hu Xingyao.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>After performing the ritual, Chairman Hu Xingyao gave a report, stating that ten years ago today, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, following the will of the Premier, led over 100,000 loyal soldiers on the Northern Expedition. Over the past few years, the country has been unified, but a few warlords have not been overthrown. Today's commemorative meeting should recognize several points:  What was the political situation ten years ago?  Why was the Northern Expedition necessary?  What are our thoughts today after ten years? Regarding the first point, the Premier, in view of the corruption and decline of the Manchu Qing government, organized the Revive China Society. As a result, the Manchu Qing dynasty was overthrown. Due to the chaos caused by warlords, the people did not benefit. Therefore, there was the Northern Expedition of the fifteenth year to establish a new Republic of China and realize the nationalism of saving the country.  The social economy was mostly controlled by local tyrants and evil gentry, who colluded with warlords. These local tyrants and evil gentry oppressed farmers and workers, so the Northern Expedition of the Revolutionary Army came to save farmers and workers and realize the principle of people's livelihood.  In the current situation, the smuggling problem in the north is serious, and there are reports of unrest in the southwest. The domestic finances are greatly affected by smuggling. The troops from Guangdong and Guangxi have caused disturbances in neighboring provinces. Although the people of the country have called for their reflection, the current situation is not optimistic. In fact, the internal affairs have long been manipulated by ambitious individuals. The current situation in the country is such that if there is another war, the future is unimaginable. The authorities in Guangdong and Guangxi should realize this as soon as possible, follow the central government's unified steps, and save the national crisis.</p>
<p>Meeting Slogans</p>
<p>Swearing-in for the Northern Expedition is to follow the Premier's will.  Swearing-in for the Northern Expedition is the preliminary work of the National Revolution.  The success of the Northern Expedition is the prelude to the realization of the Three Principles of the People.  To commemorate the success, we must revitalize the party's fighting spirit.  To commemorate the Northern Expedition, we must strive for production and construction.  To commemorate the Northern Expedition, we must unite sincerely and support the central government.</p>

You will certainly be able to see far and wide, uphold justice, plan with sincerity, and lay the foundation for our country. We are listening to your noble words with utmost respect.

All the approved cases were notified to the applicants by the committee to collect the loans. It is also reported that there are still many applicants for loans recently. However, after the committee staff provided detailed guidance on the procedures, the number of those who do not follow the principles set by the ministry has been decreasing day by day.

<h3>The Committee for the Uniform Promotion of Party and National Flags Inspected Flag Displays Throughout the City Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Committee Expressed Satisfaction with Most Areas in the City; Promotion Efforts in the Concessions Are Urgently Needed</p>
<p>The Committee for the Uniform Promotion of Party and National Flags in the city inspected the flag displays throughout the city yesterday, as it was the tenth anniversary of the swearing-in ceremony of the National Revolutionary Army. At 9 a.m. yesterday, the committee members and staff set out in four groups: 1. Ximen and the 16th Pier area, 2. Xinzha, Caojiadu, Caojing, and Xujiahui area, 3. North Station, Jiangwan, the city center, Wusong, and North Sichuan Road area, 4. Pudong area. According to reports, the flag displays were most prevalent in the Ximen and 16th Pier area, the Xinzha and Hengfeng Road area, the Wusong and Linping Road area, and the Pudong area. Generally, 80-90% of the shops have purchased the flags, and more than half of the residents have also purchased them. However, many of the flag displays were not in accordance with the regulations, and the inspectors corrected them on the spot. There were also a few instances of Party and National Flags that did not meet the regulations, but the number was extremely small. Except for those whose colors and sizes were too different, the inspectors did not confiscate them, but rather advised them to purchase new ones. According to the inspectors, they were generally satisfied with the flag displays in various parts of the city. However, in the concession areas, there were very few flag displays. This phenomenon suggests that compatriots residing in the concessions are not entirely unfamiliar with the Party and National Flags, but perhaps the promotion efforts in the concession areas have not yet begun. It is reported that the promotion work in the urban areas will be completed soon. According to reports from the promoters in various locations to the inspectors of the committee, the Public Security Bureau has sincerely assisted in the promotion work, which is why such results have been achieved. Therefore, the committee members expressed their gratitude for this.</p>

<h3>Deng Qingyang and Others Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>They took the night train to Beijing that evening to attend the morning's mausoleum visit. Huang Shi, Wang Quansheng, Li Ciwen, and Li Fulin came together.</p>
<p>Five people, including Deng Qingyang, Huang Linshu, Li Renren, Li Qian, and Cui Guangxi, all Central Committee members specially sent from the Southwest to attend the Second Plenary Session, along with Huang Shi, a Central Committee member staying in Yunnan; Wang Quansheng, a Central Committee member residing in the Philippines; Li Juewen, a Central Committee member and Guizhou Provincial Commissioner of Supervision residing in Guizhou; and Li Fulin, a Central Committee member residing in Hong Kong, arrived in Shanghai at 7:00 AM yesterday morning on the American mail ship President Jefferson.</p>
<p>Arrival Scene</p>
<p>The ship entered the port around 5:00 AM and docked at the 11th and 12th floating docks on the Yangshupu river at 7:00 AM sharp. Mayor Wu's representative, Li Dachao; Wang Zhinan, secretary of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters; and Deng's friends Huang Huapei, Zhang Mumin, Wang Zhisheng, and others went to the ship to welcome them. After exchanging greetings with the welcoming party on board, Deng and the others transferred to a special launch provided by the Municipal Public Security Bureau and landed at the Dongjiadu Wharf.

<p>Departing for Beijing That Evening</p>

<p>Wang's Remarks</p>

How can we endure further disturbances? The compatriots in the Philippines, upon hearing of the unusual movements in the Southwest, are deeply saddened. They all believe that everything can only be resolved peacefully. Various overseas Chinese organizations have repeatedly held meetings and have sent telegrams to the authorities in Guangdong and Guangxi since the 22nd of last month, earnestly advising them not to act rashly. My decision to return to the country to attend the Second Plenary Session is to convey this message on behalf of the overseas Chinese and present it to the conference, observe the situation, and see if there is still hope for peace."</p>
<h3>The Municipal General Labor Union Again Requests the Central Government to Amend the Trade Union Law</h3>
<p>Unrestricted joining and leaving hinders the sound development of trade unions, workers fear employers' authority and find it hard to resist even against their will</p>
<p>The Municipal General Labor Union has again submitted a request to the Central Standing Committee, the Executive Yuan, and the Legislative Yuan to amend Articles 20 and 21 of the Trade Union Law in order to benefit the labor movement. The original request stated: "This union previously considered Articles 20 and 21 of the Trade Union Law unsuitable for practical needs and submitted a request to your esteemed Yuan, which was approved under directive number 713. The directive stated that the Ministry of Industry's response indicated that Articles 20, Paragraph 1 and 21 of the Trade Union Law were designed to prevent trade unions from infringing upon workers' individual freedom and did not require amendment, which was deemed appropriate. Upon convening the seventh standing committee meeting to discuss this matter, it was unanimously agreed that the freedom of trade union members to join and leave should be restricted, which is currently of utmost importance. Therefore, we present our humble opinions to your esteemed leader for detailed consideration. Upon careful examination of the legislative intent behind Article 20, Paragraph 1 and Article 21 of the Trade Union Law, it appears to be to protect workers' individual freedom. This seems reasonable in theory, but in practice, it actually hinders the healthy development of trade unions. In recent years, the result of its implementation has been that shortsighted employers often use this to entice or coerce workers to withdraw from or not join trade unions in order to undermine them. Some argue that the Trade Union Law already has explicit provisions in Article 32 to prevent employers from undermining trade unions, stating that employers or their agents shall not make non-participation in trade union duties, non-membership in trade unions, or withdrawal from trade unions a condition of employment. This point seems to be unnecessary to worry about. However, it is not known that the so-called 'conditions of employment' in the aforementioned article refer to written agreements, such as labor contracts. If an employer actually forces workers to not join or withdraw from a trade union without written evidence, it is still impossible to prevent. Workers, compelled by the need to make a living, even if against their will, do not want to resist or dare to complain due to fear of the employer's authority. This situation is sufficient to endanger the existence of trade unions. If mandatory regulations are not imposed on workers' joining and leaving trade unions, it is not in line with our Party's intention to support the labor movement. Moreover, our country's legislation is based on the Three Principles of the People as the highest principle. Dr. Sun Yat-sen stated in Nationalism, 'The Chinese people are like a heap of sand and need a collective organization.' In Democracy, he stated, 'In order to resist foreign oppression in the future, we must break down individual freedom and form a very solid group.' These words are indeed true. In this extraordinary period, if the people can be tightly organized, they will be able to cope with future disasters. If trade union members are allowed to freely join and leave trade unions, it not only goes against the modern trend of interventionism in legislation but also hinders workers' interests and trade union actions. How can we talk about being loyal and dedicated to the country? For example, with the recent rampant smuggling, if the trade union can command and unify, and the organization is strict, then officials will not engage in sales, workers will not engage in loading and unloading, and unscrupulous merchants will have difficulty establishing themselves. The efficiency of anti-smuggling will definitely increase. As for protecting workers' individual freedom, Article 47 of the Trade Union Law already has explicit provisions for punishment. If the behavior violates criminal law, they should be held criminally responsible. Based on the above reasons, we dare not hesitate to continue requesting your esteemed leader to comply with public opinion and allow the transfer of this request to the Legislative Yuan to amend Article 20 of the Trade Union Law to 'All workers in the same industry or occupation organized by a trade union shall join the respective industry trade union as members,' and Article 21 to 'Trade union members shall not arbitrarily withdraw from the trade union or fail to pay membership fees without justifiable reasons and approval from the trade union' to benefit the labor movement and maintain organization. We are extremely grateful. We respectfully submit."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Bank Agrees to Provide Loans for Tung Oil in Zhejiang Province</h3>
<p>Interest at 9%, tung seeds are concentrated for oil pressing and marketing</p>
<p>Mr. Tang Xunze, director of the Cooperation Office of the Agricultural Management Department of the Construction Department of Zhejiang Province, recently came to Shanghai under orders to contact the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank about providing loans to improve the production and marketing of tung oil. It is now learned that after detailed discussions between Mr. Tang and the Shanghai Bank, the bank has proposed loan principles. The method is: first, cooperatives and cooperative federations will be organized in the tung oil production areas. Then, the Shanghai Bank will provide 500,000 yuan in mortgage loans to the farmers' banks or loan offices in each county, which will then be re-loaned to the cooperatives. Tung seeds from various counties in eastern Zhejiang, where tung oil is produced, will be collected for oil pressing, cooperative transportation and sales. The interest rate on the above loan will be set at 9%. The bank also proposes that, in order to maintain the security of the commercial bank's loans, 80% of production loans will be paid in cash. For marketing loans, the farmers' banks in each county will provide a 30% matching loan, but when repaying the loan, the investment of the outside commercial bank must be repaid first. The Zhejiang Construction Department can agree to this point, and Mr. Tang has already verbally agreed to it. Mr. Tang is now returning to Hangzhou to report on the satisfactory outcome of the negotiations. Once the responsible persons of the farmers' banks and loan offices in each county have been convened to discuss the loan application forms and loan procedures, he will sign an agreement with the Shanghai Bank to implement the plan.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Capital at the Maritime Conference Request Funding from the Ministry of Industry</h3>
<p>Three organizations to convene a meeting at the end of the month to elect representatives</p>
<p>The International Maritime Conference is scheduled to open in November this year. The Chinese government representatives, Zhao Banfu and Secretary Zhu Xuefan, have already gone abroad to attend the International Labor Conference and then attend the Maritime Conference. As for the capital representatives, the All-China Federation of Commerce, the China General Chamber of Industry, and the Shanghai Navigation Association convened a joint meeting on the 8th to elect representatives. However, since Lin Kanghou, chairman of the All-China Federation of Commerce, has not returned from his inspection in Siam, it has been decided to first request funding from the Ministry of Industry. After Mr. Lin returns to China at the end of this month, another joint meeting will be convened to nominate candidates and submit them to the Ministry of Industry for appointment.</p>
<h3>Chen Jitang Sells Cash Reserves, Panic Among the People of Guangdong and Guangxi</h3>
<p>Yang Jianping handled the first batch of 30 million yuan</p>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reports that many Shanghai Guangdong natives have recently received letters from relatives and friends in Guangzhou's business community stating that Chen Jitang is actively preparing for war, expanding his military, and raising funds and equipment with extreme urgency. The value of currency is falling daily, and there is insufficient turnover, forcing him to sell the cash reserves of corner coins accumulated in Guangzhou to foreigners. Recently, the first batch of 30 million yuan was sold to Japanese businessmen by Yang Jianping, the former director of the Postal Savings Bureau, and is currently under negotiation for payment. The people of Guangzhou, upon hearing this news, feel like a major disaster is imminent and are spreading the word. They believe that if Chen Jitang sells the cash reserves, Guangdong corner bills will become worthless paper. Not only will merchants be the first to suffer, but also those who have corner bills will go bankrupt. People are becoming increasingly panicked and feel like they cannot make it through the day. It is also reported that several Guangzhou citizens have been arrested by Chen Jitang for discussing this matter every day. There are also letters instructing people in Shanghai that if there is trading in Guangdong corner bills, they must be exchanged for Hong Kong dollars or sold immediately and not kept. Shanghai natives from Guangdong are extremely worried upon receiving this news because Guangzhou's accumulated cash reserves are related to the lifeline of the local area. If Chen Jitang sells the cash reserves and they flow to foreign countries, it will not only affect the survival of the people in Guangdong and Guangxi but also have a profound impact on the economy of the natives of Shanghai. They plan to convene an emergency meeting of the Shanghai natives to address this matter and seek relief.</p>

<h3>All-China Federation of Commerce Telegraphs Request to Amend the Laws on Chambers of Commerce and Trade Associations</h3>
<p>Requires businesses to join trade associations and trade associations to join chambers of commerce to strengthen industrial and commercial organizations and lay the foundation for the national economy</p>
<p>The All-China Federation of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the Legislative Yuan and the Ministry of Industry, stating: "We recently received a telegram from the Hankou Municipal Chamber of Commerce stating that the fifth plenary session of the members' representatives of the association on April 8th included two important proposals regarding the organization of trade associations and the chamber of commerce itself: one was to request the drafting of sanction measures for stores that do not join trade associations or, having joined, do not pay membership fees in accordance with the regulations, in order to take action; the other was to request amendments to the association's regulations for trade associations that do not join chambers of commerce, or having joined, do not fulfill their due obligations, in order to unite. Both proposals were approved by the congress and submitted to Party and government agencies for promulgation of sanction measures for compliance. However, trade associations are based on the Law on Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations, which does not have absolute restrictions on stores joining associations, resulting in many stores waiting and seeing, and the progress of associations is hindered. Although the local chambers of commerce have submitted interpretations stating that Article 7 of the law stipulates that all companies and firms in the same industry have no freedom not to join associations, since there is no explicit mandatory participation, they can still remain outside the association. If this continues for a long time, trade associations will inevitably disintegrate. This is the first matter for which we request that the Law on Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations be amended. The organization of chambers of commerce originally takes stores as its unit. The so-called trade associations are merely appended to a few clauses in the Chamber of Commerce Law as the basis for organization. In fact, trade associations and chambers of commerce are one and the same, with no possibility of independent activity. Since the separate promulgation and implementation of the Chamber of Commerce Law and the Law on Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations, the foundation of associations is in stores, while the foundation of chambers of commerce is in associations. Without associations, it is impossible to form a chamber of commerce group, and the organization of associations can proceed independently according to the Law on Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations. All the association's organizational processes and the execution of association affairs do not have a chain relationship with the chamber of commerce. They have long regarded the chamber of commerce as insignificant. For matters requiring requests from Party and government agencies, they can directly handle them in the name of their legal entity without the need for the chamber of commerce to forward them. Since authority is not unified, it is difficult to concentrate forces. Moreover, each trade association takes the interests of its own industry as the premise, and business is diverse and conflicts are frequent. The chamber of commerce, in name, is the collective organization of various industries, but it has no power to control them. There is no way to reconcile and coordinate between them, and it is not easy to set an example. Therefore, trade associations believe that joining the chamber of commerce is not a matter of vital interest to them. Some do not want to join at all, or, having joined, refuse to pay fees, violating the association's regulations. It is like the relationship between stores and trade associations. It is like the separation of a body, scattered and without belonging, which greatly undermines the government's intention to protect industry and commerce and develop industry. This is the second matter for which we request that the Law on Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations be amended. Recently, smuggling in North China has become increasingly rampant. The root cause lies in the protection of external forces, which makes it impossible to investigate and deal with it. However, the disunity and lack of self-restraint among merchants are important reasons. If we want to strengthen the organization of merchant groups, we must impose mandatory regulations. If there is resistance to compliance, we must stipulate sanction measures. For stores, we will suspend their business; for associations, we will revoke their organization, so that stores cannot leave associations freely, and associations cannot leave chambers of commerce independently. Then, the organization of industrial and commercial groups will be like the arm being directed by the hand and the finger being directed by the arm, with a consistent spirit and stronger unity. The foundation of the country's controlled economy will also be established. Based on these reasons, we respectfully submit this telegram to your esteemed Yuan and esteemed Ministry for review and verification. We earnestly request that you quickly amend the Chamber of Commerce Law and the Law on Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations in order to consolidate the organization of merchant groups and achieve the effective implementation of the law. This is of utmost importance. Hearing Lantingshi, Acting Chairman of the All-China Federation of Commerce."</p>

<p>Preparations Completed</p>
<p>The YMCA, recognizing the urgent need for air defense knowledge at this time, requested exhibits from the national aviation community last month for public display. Since the end of last month, the exhibits have been transported to this city. Models of various aircraft, such as the "Haiying" and "Haiou," are suspended in the space above the sidewalk. Looking up at them immediately reminds people of the sight of airplanes soaring in the sky. Upon entering, there are two bombs. Stepping into the lounge, there is a large aircraft model displayed in the center, with startling slogans below, such as "China has more than 400 million compatriots, so what? China has a history of over 5,000 years, so what?" Afterward, there are various air defense charts. These days, people have been working day and night to arrange them, and they are now complete.</p>

<h3>Zhang Naiqi Resigns as Deputy Manager of Zhejiang Industrial Bank</h3>
<p>Also seeking to resign as Chairman of China Credit Information Service</p>
<p>The Huadong News Agency reports that Zhang Naiqi, a banking expert and international commentator, has resigned from his positions as Deputy Manager of Zhejiang Industrial Bank and Chairman of China Credit Information Service. This has been confirmed. Zhang has not been going to the bank to work since this week. People in cultural circles are extremely surprised by Zhang's resignation, and there are many misunderstandings, saying that Zhang has gone to Hong Kong after resigning. The Huadong News Agency reporter confirmed this morning that Zhang is still in Shanghai, focusing on writing, and is not going anywhere else. The rumors of going to Hong Kong or Beijing to take up a position are not true. Yesterday, some people hosted a dinner for Zhang at the Yizhixiang Restaurant, which proves that the rumors are false. Li Fusun, General Manager of Zhejiang Industrial Bank, repeatedly tried to persuade him to stay, but to no avail. It is said that the position will be temporarily vacant and another expert will be appointed. The position of Chairman of China Credit Information Service is jointly organized by various banks. Now that Zhang has resigned from the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, he is also seeking to resign from this position. The Executive Committee of the agency has convened a meeting and elected Mr. Zhu of the Bank of China to take over.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Health Sends Personnel to Fujian</h3>

They also purchased a large number of medical equipment and medicines on behalf of Fujian Province. Dr. Lu led the majority of the personnel on the Wuxiang wheel of the Sanbei Company the day before yesterday and went to Fujian first. A large number of medicines and medical equipment will be transported to Fujian by doctors Ding Jingsheng and Li Wenlou after the purchase is complete, and work will begin immediately.</p>

<h3>Standing Committee Meeting of the All-Zhejiang Association</h3>
<p>Report on the Wen Middle School Incident Being Resolved; Proposal to Postpone the Second Installment of Old Taxes</p>
<p>The All-Zhejiang Public Association of this port held a standing committee meeting at its meeting hall in Avenuerie at 2 PM the day before yesterday. Committee members Wei Bozheng, Chu Huiseng, Zhang Shenzhi, Hu Fengxiang, Yu Zhongcheng, Pan Zhe, Chen Menglu, Jiang Zhongquan, Yao Zhimei, Chu Fengyi, Wu Guochang, Zha Zhongjian, Zhang Hengfu (representing Zha), Xu Xiajun, Shi Mengjiu, and over twenty others were present. The meeting was chaired by Chu Huiseng.</p>
<p>Reported Matters: 1. A letter from the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education replied that the Wen Middle School incident had been handled, and the school had resumed classes as usual on the 17th of this month, with order restored. 2. A letter from the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance replied that it had approved the proposed measures to improve the cleaning up of the sand fields in Yuyao, and had issued instructions for compliance. 3. The Zhejiang Provincial Donation and Tax Supervision Committee forwarded the resolution regarding the association's proposal to temporarily suspend the construction special donation. The important points were: "In recent years, taxes and levies have become increasingly heavy, and popular resentment is deepening. The reason is that tax revenues are used before they are collected. From now on, most of the budget income will be used to repay debts, while new undertakings are constantly emerging, with no source of funds. New taxes are continuously added, and new debts are constantly incurred. The donations that were supposed to be temporary cannot be reduced or exempted. The government's credibility is undermined, and the people cannot be deceived. Exhausting the pond to catch fish will inevitably lead to a complete collapse. The central government, recognizing this, strongly advocates abolishing harsh and miscellaneous taxes and reducing surcharges on land taxes, which is a wise long-term plan. It is hoped that local governments will follow this intention and make efforts to implement it, so that the people's suffering may be alleviated and the nation's vitality will not be completely exhausted. If it is difficult to raise new debts, the amount is increased through consolidation, and the collection of funds can be relied upon, or the established agreement is broken and the deadline is extended, how much strength do the people have, and how can they bear the burden?"</p>
<p>Proposed Matters: 1. Yuyao Jing Yisun submitted a petition proposing improvements to the method for cleaning up sand fields, adding opinions, and requesting transmission of the proposal. The meeting decided to comply. 2. Yang Qicheng and others, representatives of Zhejiang Railway creditors, stated that the method of reducing and repaying railway shares has caused significant losses to bondholders and requested assistance. The meeting decided that reducing and repaying debts is related to creditworthiness, and since the Zhejiang Railway has annual surpluses, it is no wonder that bondholders are unwilling to accept this. A telegram will be sent to the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Railways to request relief based on the situation.</p>
<p>Temporary Proposals: 1. The Zhejiang Province's pursuit of old taxes is governed by strict policies, and the people are suffering greatly. Fellow villagers from various places have repeatedly requested assistance from the association. However, since paying land taxes is the responsibility of the people, the association has refused to accept the request. However, since the arrears of nine years are ordered to be cleared within one year, the people's strength is insufficient, and the harassment and oppression by the tax collectors are also a reality. Fortunately, the first phase has already ended, and it is reported that over three million yuan has been collected. The second phase is scheduled to begin in September. It is proposed to postpone it to April or May next year. Is this feasible? Please discuss. The resolution: The people's suffering should be reported to the provincial government for investigation and handling. The meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>Regulations on Production Quotas and Funds Separately</p>
<p>The capital of the Federation, as stipulated in the articles of association approved by the Ministry of Industry, is 5 million yuan in national currency. Regarding the allocation of funds, the decision will be based on the quotas of each factory. It is also stipulated that the production quotas of each factory shall not be increased arbitrarily to avoid overproduction.

<p>Meeting to Decide on the Business Opening Date</p>
<p>The official opening date of the Federation also needs to be decided by the board of directors, which is expected to be in August.

<h3>Principal of Wu Lun Girls' Vocational School Accuses Male and Female Teachers of Defamation</h3>
<p>Zhu Lin, principal of the private Wu Lun Girls' Vocational School on Route Lafayette in the French Concession, recently filed a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, accusing male teachers Wu Xuecun, Cao Chuanzong, Zhou Yuanbin, Shi Dazhi, Cai Dacang, Zhu Zhao'an, and female teachers Wei Yuelu, Feng Naihua, Li Zhou, and nine others of defamation and requesting legal prosecution. The court accepted the complaint, and Sun Peng, acting as presiding officer, inspected the case in Criminal Court Two at 10:30 AM yesterday. None of the nine defendants reported to the court. Only the complainant, Zhu Lin, appeared in court. She claimed that the case was currently under mediation and requested a postponement. She also briefly stated the intent of the prosecution, claiming that the Shanghai Dagongbao newspaper published a news item on the 30th of last month about the Wu Lun Girls' School teachers' hunger strike, which was obtained by the newspaper's reporter from interviews with both the school and the teachers. However, according to the teachers, they pointed out that Xinhua Company had previously borrowed the school to take the staff recruitment examination and defrauded the security deposit. This matter was investigated by the French police and found to be irrelevant. They also said that the Municipal Education Bureau ordered the school to be suspended, but in fact, it was converted into an ordinary junior high school. They also said that the French Municipal Council protected the school, and so on. Not only were these situations inconsistent with the facts, but they also hindered the school's reputation and public credibility. A copy of the Dagongbao newspaper was submitted as evidence. The court reviewed the statements and said that both parties in this case were serving in education and should be reconciled. Moreover, the prosecution in this case cited legal provisions that are crimes that can only be prosecuted upon complaint. If a reconciliation can be reached, a statement can be submitted to withdraw the lawsuit. It was announced that the hearing would be rescheduled for the morning of the 13th, and the court adjourned.</p>

<h3>Liu Baosheng Sentenced for Privately Carrying Drugs</h3>
<p>Cui Chengke, a Chinese detective of the Wayside Police Station, arrested a young man named Liu Baosheng, a native of Lu, near Gongping Road at 1 PM on the 30th of last month. Four small bags of heroin were found on his person. He claimed that he lived at 52 Sanguantang, Huaji Road, and that the heroin belonged to a friend of his father, surnamed Yang, and was to be delivered to 980 Dongyouheng Road. Detective Cui rushed to the address to arrest him. Tang Jinhai, the subtenant, said that he was currently staying in Nanshih in the Chinese area. A search of Liu Baosheng's home revealed Chen Qiusi, a woman from Tongzhou, sleeping in the pavilion. His father fled upon hearing the news. Chen was also taken to the First Special District Court for investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiewei continued the trial in Criminal Court Three. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Municipal Council, stated that the main culprit could not be arrested as the date was postponed. Liu Baosheng confessed that he had been fooled by Yang, a friend of his father, and asked for leniency. Chen Qiusi stated that she had gone to Liu Baosheng's home to ask his father for a debt and fell asleep on the bed, resulting in her being mistakenly arrested. Judge Xiao sentenced Liu Baosheng to one year and six months in prison, and Chen Qiusi was released. The evidence was confiscated.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Railways has allocated 800,000 yuan from the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway loan to reduce and repay the old debts of the former Su-Zhe Railway, including shares and company bonds. The Su-Zhe Railway Debt Liquidation Office has announced that the repayment will begin on the 7th. The Su-Zhe Bondholders Group believes that the last batch of debts is already seventeen or eighteen years overdue, and not only has it not been repaid with principal and interest, but it has been discounted by more than half, resulting in substantial losses. Therefore, Yang Qicheng, Wang Weide, and others have called on the All-Zhejiang Public Association to send a telegram to the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Railways to find a way to make up for the losses, and at the same time, the Bondholders Group directly sent a telegram to the liquidation offices of the two railways, denying the method. Yesterday morning, Wang Weide was publicly elected as a representative to go to Hangzhou to exchange dissenting opinions with the Zhejiang Railway bond debtors and creditors. He will return to Shanghai this afternoon. The reporter from the Industry and Commerce News visited Yang Qicheng, the chairman of the group, who said that the total debt was 1.58 million yuan. The last batch of funds should have been fully repaid in 1918, but the authorities have repeatedly delayed and ignored the repayment. The creditors believe that the profits of the two railways have increased year by year and urgently need to repay the principal and interest. They have filed administrative lawsuits many times, and the authorities have also confirmed that the amount of this debt must be repaid. However, not only has no interest been paid, but the principal has been discounted so much that the creditors cannot remain silent. It has now been decided to jointly go to Nanjing to petition the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee after the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Railways send a telegram to the All-Zhejiang Public Association and the liquidation offices reply to the group. We must achieve the goal of protecting the interests of the creditors. As for the future response, the group plans to convene a plenary meeting in the next few days to discuss it in detail.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Railways Actively Pursuing Full Line Opening of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway</h3>
<p>Borrowing Large Sum from Construction Bank, Assigning Personnel to Oversee Zha-Cao Section Project</p>
<p>The Qiantang River Bridge, jointly built by the Ministry of Railways and the Zhejiang Provincial Government, is under active construction with a strict deadline for completion. Once it is completed and the rails are laid, the east and west banks of the Qiantang River will be directly accessible, and the full-line opening of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway will no longer be a problem. Therefore, a large sum has been borrowed from the Municipal Construction Bank to actively plan the Zha-Cao section from Zha Kou to Caoe River via Xiaoshan and Shaoxing, and to build a bridge over the Caoe River to connect the Zha-Cao section for traffic. Then, the Shanghai-Ningbo section can be reached from morning to evening. The route from Zha Kou through the Qiantang River Bridge to Caoe has long been surveyed and completed. The section from Jingjiang Station on the east bank of the river to Xiaoshan will be renovated using heavy-duty rails by borrowing the Hangzhou-Jiangshan road. The roadbed from Xiaoshan to Caoe has already been built and is currently being measured for mileage and setting of wooden stakes. In order to quickly complete the Zha-Cao section track connection project, the Ministry of Railways will send personnel to Zhejiang to oversee the track connection project.</p>
<h3>Severe Heat Wave in the City</h3>
<p>98 Degrees at Noon Feels Like Being in a Volcano, Many Coolies and Vagrants Collapse from Heatstroke</p>
<p>The city has been experiencing another heat wave recently, and the observatory's forecast has indeed come true. After the heat wave began on the morning of the 8th, the evening was not cool. The scorching heat was even worse on the 9th. The temperature in the central district at noon reached 98 degrees, breaking the new record for this year.</p>
<p>Citywide Scorching Heat</p>
<p>Yesterday's heat was even more severe than the day before. After 6 AM, various parts of the city were invaded by the scorching sun. The heat was extremely high. By 11 AM, as noon approached, the heat was even more intense. In the central district of the Public Concession, the thermometer reached 96 degrees (but the observatory reported only 93 degrees, because the observatory is located in a shady area with dense trees in western Shanghai, where the climate is cooler). At 12 PM noon, it reached 98.5 degrees, almost reaching 99 degrees. The entire city felt like being in a volcano.</p>
<p>Many Heatstrokes</p>
<p>In this kind of scorching heat, workers cannot withstand the sweltering heat, and many suffer from epidemic summer diseases. Therefore, there are especially many people being diagnosed and treated in various epidemic hospitals. Among the dock coolies in the Bund area of the French Concession, one or two also collapsed from heatstroke while working yesterday morning due to being unable to withstand the heavy burden and scorching heat. They were sent to the hospital for diagnosis and treatment. There were also vagrants along the way who could not withstand the struggle against the scorching sun and fainted.</p>
<p>Parks Are Crowded</p>
<p>The heat has been severe in recent days, and even the evenings have not been cool. Citizens have flocked to the parks to cool off. The Wenmiao, Gujiazhai, Bund, Zhaofeng, Hongkou, and other parks within the city limits have been crowded with visitors every night, especially the Bund Garden, which is like a pond of fish. There are also more people cooling off on the streets, and the roads are blocked with people in the evenings, causing inconvenience to pedestrians.</p>

<h3>Policeman Shot and Robbed by Bandits Dies of Serious Injuries</h3>
<p>Jiang Huai'an Dies in the Line of Duty; Public Security Bureau to Provide Compensation</p>
<p>Police Officer Jiang Huai'an of the Sanguantang Police Station in South Shanghai was shot by bandits and robbed of his firearms and ammunition, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that after Officer Jiang was injured, he was rushed to Shanghai Hospital for emergency treatment. He eventually died at 0:20 AM yesterday due to excessive bleeding and because both bullets in his chest could not be removed. Yao Guangnai, the director of the Ximen Branch Bureau, deeply mourned the officer's death in the line of duty. In addition to allocating 50 yuan for clothing and a coffin, he submitted a request to Director Cai for generous compensation and issued a strict order to apprehend the perpetrators and bring them to justice. Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, the local court commissioned a prosecutor to conduct an inspection. The police station chief of Sanguantang Police Station then arranged for the funeral.</p>
<h3>Detainees at the Second Special District Court Detention Center Cause Trouble Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>Resisting Orders in Groups, Twisting and Beating Guards</p>
<p>Detainees at the Second Special District Court Detention Center (formerly the site of the Second Special Prison) in the French Concession's Rue Massenet, recently requested improved treatment from officials. Failing to achieve their goals, on the morning of the 8th at around 9:00 AM, the detainees gathered and shouted. Guards and security personnel were unable to stop them and reported to the French Concession Police. Chinese and Western detectives rushed to suppress the disturbance, which was eventually quelled. Twelve suspects, including Li Shiying from Henan, who had not yet been tried, were taken back to the police station for interrogation. This was reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the French Concession Police sent the twelve detainees back to the detention center. Unexpectedly, the detainees resisted orders in groups and refused to enter the prison cells. They attacked and twisted and beat the guards. Two detainees, Tang Jinsheng and Wu Sannan, broke porcelain pieces and struck their own faces, claiming they had been beaten. They shouted for help. The duty guards and security personnel did their best to stop them. The offending detainees were shackled and locked up. The supervising department reported the incident to the Procuratorate of the Second Special District Court. At 11:00 AM, Chief Prosecutor Qiao Wanxuan, accompanied by forensic doctor Jiang Xuan and clerk Peng Yi, arrived at the detention center to investigate. Duty guards Liu Ying, Teng Guodong, and Dai Rude successively reported the situation of the detainees resisting. Tang Jinsheng and Wu Sannan, who were the leaders and injured, were presented. They claimed that their request for improved treatment had not been met and that they did not intend to resist the internal regulations of the detention center. They pointed to their heads, claiming that they had been beaten and bled by the guards with leather belts. Forensic doctor Jiang then conducted a detailed examination of Tang's injuries, finding a corner of a broken porcelain piece in the wound, proving that it was indeed injured by a porcelain piece and not a leather belt. The official scolded Tang and the others, saying that if there were requests that could be fulfilled, they would naturally be fulfilled. Why did they have to disobey the regulations and gather to make noise, which would be punished according to law? The guards then took Tang and Wu back to their cells. Subsequently, Section Chief Shao Zhenji of the prison accompanied Chief Qiao and others on an inspection of the prison cells. The matter concluded at noon, and they returned to the court.</p>
<h3>Two Rickshaw Pullers Die of Heatstroke on the Road</h3>
<p>Both Were Examined by the Court Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Procuratorate of the First Special District Court requested an examination by the Public Concession Police of two rickshaw pullers who had died of heatstroke on the road due to the hot weather. Zhang Henghe from Jiangbei, 28 years old, was a substitute chauffeur for the Chen family on Fair Road. At 4:40 PM the day before yesterday, while pulling a rickshaw at the intersection of Wusong Road and Tiantong Road, he suddenly collapsed and lost consciousness. A street patrol noticed and reported to the Hongkou Police, who summoned an ambulance to the scene. He was rushed to Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment, but to no avail, and he soon died. Sun Hongcai from Yancheng, 35 years old, resided at No. 22 Hong'an Lane, Xinmin Road, Zhabei, and worked as a rickshaw puller. At 12:00 PM the day before yesterday, while pulling a rickshaw at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Haining Road, he suddenly collapsed. A street patrol reported to the Hongkou Police, who ordered an ambulance to rush him to Tongren Hospital. Treatment was ineffective, and he soon died. At around 10:00 AM, the First Special District Court dispatched Prosecutor Zhang Ru, accompanied by forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuyi, to the Fielun Road morgue. The examination confirmed that both corpses had died of heatstroke. The families were instructed to separately sign guarantees to claim the bodies.</p>
<h3>Jin Taocheng Sentenced to Death for Wife's Murder</h3>
<p>Jin Taocheng, a Jiangbei native, 22 years old, was formerly a worker at the Public Works Department's Sanitation Department. After being laid off, he experienced prolonged unemployment and financial hardship. His wife, Jin Yu-shi, 23 years old, returned to her mother's home at No. 13 Pingfang, Qijiacun, Gordon Road. She then worked as a worker at Fuxin Tobacco Company to make a living. Recently, Jin Taocheng asked his wife to live with him, but she refused. At 12:20 PM on the 25th of last month, he hid a fruit knife and went to his in-laws' house. He pulled out the sharp knife and stabbed Jin Yu-shi several times, causing severe injuries to her neck and chest. The police were alerted and rushed Jin Yu-shi to Guangren Hospital for treatment, but to no avail, and she soon died. The murderer, Jin Taocheng, was captured on the spot, along with the murder weapon, and taken to the Putuo Road Police Station. He was sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation, where he confessed clearly. The court announced the sentence, which was reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, presiding judge Tan Xinzhen took his seat in the Eighth Criminal Court and ordered Jin Taocheng to be brought to court for sentencing. The main text of the judgment stated: "Jin Taocheng is sentenced to death for murder, with permanent deprivation of civil rights. The murder weapon is confiscated."</p>

<h3>Lu Ziliang and Others Accused of Verbally Abusing Lawyer</h3>
<p>Cursing Loudly, Over a Hundred Spectators; Lawyer Zhu Files a Lawsuit in Extreme Indignation</p>
<p>Chen Hongfu, a farmer from Chongming who lived in Gaohang, Pudong, was beaten to death last year, and his body was abandoned by the riverbank. When Prosecutor Li Fen of the Shanghai Local Court arrived for the examination, the deceased's wife, Chen Huang-shi, covered her face without tears. She was taken to court for investigation, and based on the statements of the local bailiffs, Chen's maternal uncle, Lu Ziliang, was also suspected of conspiracy and was arrested and prosecuted. This spring, they were declared innocent, and the prosecutor is currently appealing. Recently, Zhu Wenming, Lu Ziliang's defense lawyer, privately sued Lu Ziliang and his nephew Lu Jinfu, who acted as an intermediary, for public insult in the Local Court. Yesterday, Judge Li Xuedeng opened the court for trial. Zhu Wenming's female lawyer, Zhang Jie, appeared in court and testified: "I am 27 years old, from Wujin, and reside at No. 4, Lane 1851, Yangshupu. Lu Ziliang hired me as his defense lawyer for the murder case, with a fee of 100 yuan. I received 66 yuan, and 34 yuan is still owed. When I requested payment, Lu Ziliang and Lu Jinfu came on May 22nd and claimed that Lu Ziliang was prohibited from seeing visitors and that I was not working to help them. They blamed me for not bringing out the five witnesses who were detained because their testimonies did not match. However, I requested the association to release them on bail the next day, but the prohibition of visits was the judge's prerogative. They then slammed the table and cursed me, calling me a 'gangster lawyer,' 'bum lawyer,' 'begging lawyer,' and 'barren lawyer,' shouting in the main street, attracting over a hundred spectators. Therefore, I reported to the patrol and they were taken away. Because they live in the Chinese territory, I am filing a lawsuit with your court. I am too angry and want to sue them," she said. Lu Jinfu testified: "I am 42 years old, from Chongming. Lu Ziliang did not come because of illness. There was a dispute over the lawyer's fees, but there was no verbal abuse. I am now willing to pay the 30 yuan fee," he said. Finally, witness Pan Zihuan testified to the situation of the verbal abuse at the time. The official stated that the defendant should reconcile with the plaintiff and ruled that Lu Ziliang should be brought to court for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Landlord Qiao Puhuan Accused of Restricting Freedom</h3>
<p>Also Accused of Dereliction of Duty by the Ximen Public Security Branch Bureau Chief</p>
<p>Li Jiang-shi, a woman from Nanjing residing at the Lingjiazhai on Manufacturing Bureau Road, and Liang Jia-zhou from Anhui, accused Ximen Branch Bureau Chief Yao Guangnai of dereliction of duty and landlord Qiao Puhuan of restricting freedom in the Local Court. They claimed that Li Jiang-shi's husband, Li Jiatong, and Liang Jia-zhou had rented houses from Qiao and owed rent. Qiao then colluded with the Ximen Branch Bureau to detain Li Jiatong and Liang's wife in the bureau for as long as eight days without release. They argued that owing rent was a civil debt, but Qiao used the method of restricting freedom. The bureau chief abused his power by managing a case he should not have and by illegally arresting and detaining them. They requested that the victims be released and prosecuted according to law. The court has already sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau requesting verification and handling.</p>
<h3>Bund Bus Stop to Be Moved to Nanjing Road</h3>

The location will be 40 feet west of the main entrance of the Palace Hotel and will be implemented soon.</p>

<h3>City Federation Requests Public Works Department to Reduce House Tax According to Rent Reduction</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Citizens' Federation of the First Special District sent a letter to the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, stating: "We, the First District Branch of our Federation, and the Nanjing Road Business Federation have sent a letter (details omitted, as reported previously), along with photos of rent reduction tickets. In recent years, the market has been sluggish and business has been difficult. Rent and tax reductions have become a necessary trend to cope with the environment. Your department's collection of house tax has always been based on the amount of rent. When rent is reduced, house tax should also be reduced proportionally. Moreover, last autumn, Jicheng Pharmacy at No. 166 Nanjing Road received a refund of overpaid tax after reducing its rent, setting a precedent. We request your department to treat the request of Taikang Company and others for a refund or deduction of overpaid house tax in the same way, in accordance with the precedent, in order to alleviate business difficulties and maintain the market."</p>

<h3>China Fine Arts Association Holds Summer Dinner Party</h3>
<h3>Decides to Hold the First Art Exhibition</h3>
<p>The China Fine Arts Association, though established only half a year ago, has members all over the country, and its work is progressing exceptionally actively.

Yesterday was the association's summer dinner party, held in the painting hall on the fourth floor of the Daxin Company on Nanjing Road, the exhibition venue for the works of the association's executive director Liu Haisu's second trip to Europe.

<h3>Citizen's Association Sends Letter to French Municipal Council to Correct Arrest Procedures</h3>
<h3>Detaining Bao Gang's Family Without a Court Warrant and Beating and Humiliating the Arrested Is Especially Heinous</h3>
<p>Lawyer Bao Gang filed a complaint with the Procuratorate of the Court against Cui Changgui and Yang Yuehua for colluding and framing him, as well as against Zhang Datong, the captain of the detective team, Zhuang Shilin, the squad leader, Wang Peiting, the foreman, and Li Shaochen, the detective, for abusing their power and illegally detaining him. The case was handed over to the French Concession Police Department for the arrest of the suspects. According to regulations, a warrant should have been issued by the court first, but the department did not follow this procedure and arrested the suspects without authorization, which is a violation of the court agreement. Furthermore, detectives such as Wang Ada beat and humiliated the detainees, which is especially heinous. Therefore, Bao Gang sent a letter to the Citizen's Association of the Second Special District and other public organizations, requesting assistance and upholding justice. The original text of the letter from the Citizen's Association of the Second Special District to the French Municipal Council is as follows:</p>
<p>"To Whom It May Concern,</p>
<p>According to a letter from citizen Bao Gang, a lawyer residing at 33 Shou'an Lane, Minti Ni Yin Road, Second Special District, Shanghai, who has always been law-abiding, on the afternoon of the 21st of last month, around 11 p.m., detectives from the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau Detective Team, together with a Western detective (name unknown) and Chinese detective Wang Ada from the Lujiiawan Police Station, forcefully broke into the citizen's residence and, when asked what crime he had committed, claimed that Bao Gang was involved in seduction. When asked if they had any evidence, they replied that they had a statement from the plaintiff. The family argued that even if Bao Gang had committed a crime, it should not involve the laborers, and there was no need to detain them. Detective Wang Ada became enraged and slapped and kicked Zhang Xinkui and Ma Heshang, who were being detained. As a result, they were detained overnight. However, upon reflection, the police station did not receive an official document from the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau or a warrant from the Second Special Court and only relied on the unilateral testimony of the detectives to arrest and detain the citizen's family members without cause. The procedure was improper, and they arbitrarily insulted and aided the evildoers, which is extremely illegal. In such a situation, where is the security of the citizens? If one is falsely accused and immediately arrested, all citizens in the district will be in constant danger. The citizens regard your council as an organization for the welfare of all citizens in the district, upholding justice and sparing no effort. Therefore, we request that your council investigate the truth from the Public Works Department Police Station and strive to negotiate a resolution, so that the beneficiary will not be just one citizen. This letter is sent to you in the hope that you will investigate and handle it accordingly."</p>
<p>Based on this, we have found that the Police Department should first issue an arrest warrant to the court before arresting criminals. Now, the department has not fulfilled this procedure and arrested them without authorization, which is a violation of the court agreement. Moreover, detectives such as Wang Ada arbitrarily beat and humiliated the detainees, which is especially heinous. According to the aforementioned situation, we request that your bureau promptly investigate the truth of the facts and earnestly correct the errors in the arrest procedures to uphold the law and ensure the safety of the citizens. We hope that you will investigate and handle this matter and provide a reply.</p>
<h3>Commemorating the First Anniversary of Nie Er's Death; Music Circles Prepare Memorial</h3>
<p>It has been a year since the passing of the young progressive musician Nie Er, who died while swimming in Japan.

<p>Already Submitted to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry for Review and Action</p>

All submitted materials have been noted and have been submitted to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry for review and action. This approval was issued on July 6, 1936, by Chiang Kai-shek, President of the Executive Yuan.</p>
<h3>Relieving Freed Slave Girls; Preparing to Establish a Liberated Women and Children's Training Center</h3>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau convened a meeting of various groups yesterday and decided that the Ciyou Association will first establish a training center for 100 people.</p>
<p>Since the central government promulgated the measures to prohibit domestic slavery, the Municipal Public Security Bureau has been handling registration, and the registration has been enthusiastic.

<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>As the meeting began, Chairman reported, roughly stating: Since the central government promulgated the measures to prohibit domestic slavery, the Municipal Public Security Bureau has been actively carrying out the orders, and more than 200 people have registered. Among them, more than 30 have already been freed and are awaiting relief. There are only three months left until the end of the registration period, and there will certainly be more registrants in the future, and the number of freed slaves will not be small. If no relief and training organizations are prepared, the freed slave girls will have no place to rest, which is contrary to the original intention of the central government. The bureau has approved the Public Security Bureau's request to discuss relief measures and has convened a meeting of various charitable organizations, hoping that the attendees will share their insights and cooperate to assist.</p>
<p>Decided Measures</p>
<p>*   A liberated women and children's training center will be established. The Public Security Bureau, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the China Ciyou Association will jointly develop a plan and actively implement it.</p>
<p>*   Before the training center is established, the China Ciyou Association is willing to first establish a training center for 100 people. In addition to the 5,000 yuan raised by the association, the Public Security Bureau is requested to provide subsidies for the remaining amount.</p>
<p>*   A temporary quota of 40 freed slave girls has been set. The Xin Puyu Hall, the Zhabei Charity Group, the Women's Temperance Society, and the China Women and Children Relief Association will each be responsible for the training of 10 people.</p>
<p>*   After the entire plan for the training center is formulated, the Social Affairs Bureau will convene a meeting of various charitable organizations to proceed.</p>

<p>The National Academic Work Advisory Office recently sent letters to the education bureaus of all provinces and cities, stating that among the personnel registered with this office, there are many who are willing to serve as teachers. Now that the semester is coming to an end and schools are preparing to add or replace teachers, there are cases where inquiries are difficult to make, and there is no way to find suitable candidates, resulting in situations where learning is not applied, or learning cannot be applied. This makes it difficult to develop talent. This situation deeply and greatly affects the progress of education. The staff of this office, in order to adjust academic talents, strive to ensure that supply and demand correspond, and use talents appropriately, in order to achieve the national purpose of cultivating talents. A copy of the "Registration Form for Public and Private Groups Seeking Staff" is attached for your review. Please forward it to all levels of directly affiliated schools, and when adding or replacing faculty members, fill out and send the form to this office for assistance in finding and recommending candidates. We are deeply grateful for your assistance.</p>

<h3>Accompanying Notes of the World Games Delegation</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Special Correspondent Feng Youzhen (Second Letter)</p>
<p>Longing for the Arrival in Hong Kong</p>
<p>Yesterday, I wrote a letter from Hong Kong, reporting on the life of the World Games athletes on their way from Shanghai to Hong Kong. Now, as I pick up my pen to write the second letter, it has been sixteen hours since we left Hong Kong, and we are another 290 nautical miles away from our motherland (the Conte Verde travels at a speed of 18 nautical miles per hour).</p>
<p>The mail ship was originally scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong at 1:00 PM yesterday, but due to slow sailing speed, it did not arrive until 5:00 PM. These four hours of delay were truly agonizing. After two days of sea life, we were already a bit tired of it. People who are used to living on land want to disembark as soon as possible to relax.</p>
<p>Two or three hours before the ship docked, we had already seen a series of green hills lined up on both sides of the blue water. Everyone knew that Hong Kong was getting closer and closer. Since leaving the Wusongkou, all we had seen was the endless blue sky and water. Therefore, these series of green hills not only gave everyone a lot of hope but also gave us endless joy in spirit.</p>
<p>At a little past 4 o'clock, Hong Kong and Kowloon were finally in sight. Many neat and tall Western-style buildings were built from the seaside all the way to the mid-levels of the mountain. The trees on the top of the mountain were lush, as if covered with a layer of emerald green. Everyone greeted this beautiful island with a burst of enthusiastic cheers. The mail ship gradually approached the Kowloon Wharf. Hundreds of people gathered on the deck of the first-class cabin, ready to disembark. The babbling sounds were deafening, and the overflowing sweat made people sick.</p>
<p>At 5:30, the mail ship docked at the wharf and the gangway was set up. Just as everyone was about to disembark, a heavy rain suddenly came, which was a real killjoy. Hundreds of welcoming personnel on the wharf and passengers on the deck just watched helplessly, waving their handkerchiefs and gesturing. This was delayed for half an hour until the rain stopped and the sky cleared. Then, everyone scrambled and rushed out of a small door next to the cabin like lice. We finally completed the 870 nautical miles of the long journey and took a preliminary paragraph.</p>
<p>Farewell Party by All Circles in Hong Kong</p>
<p>The compatriots in Hong Kong are no less interested in the delegation's decision to go abroad than those in other parts of the country. Initiated by the Chinese Athletic Association, all circles in Hong Kong not only sent hundreds of representatives to the Kowloon Wharf to welcome us but also held a farewell party at the South China Athletic Association. However, the mail ship only stayed in Hong Kong for two hours as scheduled. Therefore, the farewell party could only be held in a simple and solemn ceremony. After all the athletes disembarked, a special ship prepared by the farewell party of all circles welcomed us to cross the river. Except for a few who needed to buy goods or had other private matters, most of them took specially prepared cars from Hong Kong Harbor to the South China Athletic Association. Chairman Xie Yuchuan delivered a simple farewell speech in Cantonese, and Mr. Chen read the prepared farewell speech in Mandarin. Shen Siliang and Hao Gengsheng successively delivered speeches on behalf of the delegation. What the guests and hosts said was nothing but mutual encouragement, so I will not go into details. After having tea and snacks, the ceremony ended. Although the ceremony was very simple, the kindness of the Hong Kong compatriots was very touching.</p>
<p>Beautiful Island</p>
<p>When the reporter disembarked from the mail ship, he did not want to compete with everyone because he saw that the order was too chaotic. Therefore, he did not disembark until the end with Zhou Yesun and Han Wengan, two colleagues from the Hong Kong branch who came to greet me. At that time, the welcoming ferry had already left. We had to take an ordinary ferry across the river.</p>
<p>The good order of the ferries between Hong Kong and Kowloon is worth praising. The ferry wharf is very large, but only one person manages it. A ratchet-type door is installed from the entrance to the ferry, and you must enter one by one in order. This ratchet-type door is managed by the ticket seller. You pay him the fee, and he moves the mechanism to let you in. Therefore, the ferry wharf is always quiet and silent, without any disturbances. I think this is worth referring to by those responsible for promoting the New Life Movement. I think that if we want to make the New Life Movement very effective, we must fundamentally pay attention to education and edification, but at the same time, we must not neglect the system and method. If we have a good system and appropriate method, we can save a lot of energy and achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>The ferry is divided into two classes. The upper level is the first class, with a fee of one dime per trip, and the lower level is the second class, with a fare of four cents. A sign is hung on the ferry, stipulating that feet are not allowed to be placed on the seats, cigarette butts are not allowed to be thrown, and spitting is not allowed. Everyone does as they are told, so the boat is very clean. The boat can be driven at both ends without having to turn around. The speed is also very fast, and it takes seven or eight minutes to reach the destination. It is said that the business is very prosperous. Our major ports along the Yangtze River, such as between Nanjing and Pukou, and between Wuchang and Hankou, should be improved in this way.</p>
<p>Hong Kong after the rain is spotless. The cleanliness and smoothness of the roads are probably better than the floors of many families. The weather is so cool, unlike the climate of the southern country we imagined. The great Western-style buildings are arranged very neatly. Although electric cars are very frequent on the wide roads, there is no noise at all. In terms of material things, this beautiful island is worth cherishing. No wonder many retired warlords and politicians want to live here with their ill-gotten gains.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is a place I have visited before. I have already visited the whole island. Except for material construction, there is nothing else to enjoy. In addition, the time is so pressing. I just hurriedly bought some necessary items and saw one or two friends, and then hurried back to Kowloon in the evening glow. When I was sitting on the ferry, a colorful rainbow hung high in the blue sky, adding a lot of brilliance to this beautiful island.</p>
<p>Leaving Hong Kong and Continuing</p>
<p>When the mail ship was docked, it was originally announced that it would depart on time at 7:00. However, we ate dinner and chatted and played games in the smoking room until after 8:00 before we set sail. I didn't expect foreigners to have such a big difference in time. Everyone was a little unhappy about the mail ship's extended departure, not because they wanted to arrive in Italy earlier, but because they regretted not being able to stay in Hong Kong for a longer time.</p>
<p>In any case, at 8:30, the mail ship left Hong Kong and continued to Singapore. When we leaned on the side of the ship, we saw the lights of the entire mountain in Hong Kong, shining like stars in the sky. People who had never seen such a scene were so surprised that they shouted.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, we couldn't see anything except darkness. The bright moon hanging in the sky the night before should have expanded her circle, but the dark clouds in the sky didn't know where they had hidden her. The sea breeze was blowing, one gust after another. The huge waves hit the iron plate, making a terrible roar. The ship was shaking a little up and down. At this time, not only was there no one on the deck, but the smoking room was not as lively as it had been the previous two days. However, a few people were still very brave and were able to go to the first-class cabin to watch a movie.</p>
<p>The reporter was afraid of the small sandbars in the Yangtze River. He had been used to sailing on white wooden boats since he was a child and had been trained by the surging waves. Therefore, he had no seasickness at all. When he walked into the bedroom at 10:30, the servant had tightly closed the small window facing the wind because the waves were hitting the room, which was somewhat stuffy.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Huang Jiliang, the goalkeeper of the Hong Kong football team, Huang Yingjie, a high jumper, Chen Zhenxing and Yang Xiuqiong, swimmers, and Xu Minhui, Guo Songtang, Liu Quanda, Ye Guanyan, and Tan Jianbin, nine members of the sports observation delegation, boarded the ship, making the ship even more lively.</p>
<p>Training on the Ship</p>
<p>A round of sunrise rose from the intersection of the sky and the water. The sky restored its shining color, and the wind and waves calmed down. Many decks were again showing a lively atmosphere.</p>
<p>The two fish who were used to living in the water—Chen Zhenxing and Yang Xiuqiong—changed into their swimsuits early in the morning and began training. The swimming pool was on the deck of the economic second class. It was a square made of thick wooden boards, covered with painted thick canvas, creating a small pool more than ten feet square, filled with seawater. Although they couldn't stretch their bodies, it was better than having no chance to practice.</p>
<p>The two fish swam back and forth in the small pool, shocking dozens of land athletes who surrounded them and watched in a daze. A small wave overturned the water in the pool. People standing nearby were splashed with wet shoes and socks, causing a burst of laughter. The naughty Fu Baolu refused to be outdone, changed into his swimsuit, and joined the practice. He aimed the water-filling faucet directly at the mermaid. She didn't hide in the water, but she couldn't catch her breath. When she came out of the water, she screamed for mercy, and everyone laughed again.</p>
<p>The track and field and basketball players also began training at 5:00 PM today. The location was on the deck of the first-class cabin, which was the result of special negotiations. Before arriving in Hong Kong, the captain only agreed to lend it from 5:00 to 9:00 every morning. However, at this time, the passengers in the first-class cabin were still in their dreams, and our athletes might not want to rest. Therefore, the training only started today after departing from Shanghai. The training method is very simple. Everyone runs for ten minutes, and the basketball players practice passing. Because this is the most possible way to practice on the ship. Otherwise, eating and sleeping on the ship will easily gain ten or eight pounds, which is no joke. This kind of training will be held once a day in the future.</p>
<p>Explanation of the Contents and Various Dives of the Olympic Diving Competition (4) Qian Yiqin</p>
<p>Category 1: Facing the Water, Forward Diving, Table A: Simple Forward Head Dive</p>
<p>Category 1: Facing the Water, Forward Diving, Table A: Forward Tuck Dive</p>
<p>Category 1: Facing the Water, Forward Diving, Table A: Inward Somersault</p>
<p>Although there was still a bit of wind and waves at night, everyone could still bear it. Movies were playing on the first-class deck, and many people went to watch them. However, the main force was still concentrated on the deck of the economic second class. The sound of the huqin, the sound of Peking opera, and the sound of guessing fingers were all mixed together until after 10:00 before it became quiet.</p>
<p>The ship's staff initiated a game called "Horse Racing," which was actually a disguised form of gambling. The method was this: a long canvas was marked with six lanes, and each lane was divided into ten squares. At the starting point, six wooden horses were placed. Participants had to buy tickets and then use dice to move. The number of points rolled would move the corresponding horse one square. Whoever moved to the finish line first would win money. However, in the end, only one Italian passenger bought a ticket. The ship's staff saw that it couldn't be played, so they had to roll up the canvas listlessly.</p>
<p>It's late, I'll write again tomorrow. June 29th night on the ship (to be continued tomorrow)</p>
<h3>Hua Cheng Cup Singles Tournament Opens Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Forty-Four Participants</p>
<p>The registration for the first Hua Cheng Cup singles tournament organized by the Conte Tennis Club closed yesterday. A total of forty-four people participated in the singles. The opening ceremony is scheduled to be held at the Conte court tomorrow (11th) at 4:00 PM. The first week can be completed on the same day. The second week will be held from the morning of the day after tomorrow and can also be completed on the same day. The dates for the third and fourth weeks will be determined temporarily, and the time will be from 4:45 PM. The semi-finals are scheduled for the 23rd, and the finals will be held at 3:30 PM on the 25th. Carson is the most popular to win the singles championship. Other players such as Zhang Dingzhao, Forbes, Kora Sha, Zhou Guanjun, and Luo Minmo are also quite strong. There will be a fierce competition at that time. It is a pity that our country's strong players Lin Shihua, Qiu Feihai, and Wang Wenzheng are not in Shanghai, so the trophy may be given to others, which is a pity. More than ten groups have already participated in the doubles competition. The registration deadline is noon on the 15th of this month, the competition will begin on the 18th, and the finals will be held on the 26th.</p>
<h3>Conte vs. North Grassland Supplementary Match, First Group</h3>
<p>5:00 PM Today</p>
<p>In the Shanghai Grass Court Tennis Doubles League, in the Conte vs. North Grassland match the other day, the first group, He Jialiu and Chen Yi, played against Gao Qu and Mastol. The North Grassland requested a postponement because Mastol was ill. With Conte's consent, the supplementary match is scheduled to be held at the Conte court at 5:00 PM today. In addition, the first group match between Conte and Portugal was not continued due to intense competition and late hours. The date of the supplementary match has not yet been decided after two rounds of discussion.</p>

<h3>Municipal Education Bureau and Global Student Association Jointly Send Off Students Going Abroad</h3>
<p>Letters Sent to Various Cultural Organizations for Joint Participation</p>
<p>Students Going to the United States Scheduled to Go Abroad in Five Batches</p>
<p>The annual send-off ceremony for students going abroad this year is still initiated by the Global Student Association and the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, jointly organized by various educational and cultural organizations. The dates for these students going to the United States have also been determined. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Joint Send-Off by Cultural Organizations</p>
<p>Since obtaining the consent of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, the Global China Student Association, in accordance with past practice, jointly initiated the preparation for sending off students going abroad. Letters were sent to various cultural and educational organizations in the city to solicit joint initiation. As of yesterday, more than ten organizations have formally responded to participate, including Jinan University, Guanghua University, the Municipal Education Association, the Municipal Local Association, Shen Bao, Xinwen Bao, Min Bao, Dalu Bao, Zhonghua Book Company, Commercial Press, and World Book Company. It is expected that more than forty or fifty organizations will participate in the send-off ceremony. Once all the replies are received, the first preparatory meeting will be held to discuss various important issues such as the date and location of the send-off ceremony, and famous people will be invited to give speeches.</p>
<p>Students Going to the United States Scheduled to Go Abroad</p>
<p>Among the students in this year's class, those going to the United States still account for the majority. According to statistics from the Global Student Association, there are more than two hundred people. The first batch is scheduled to go abroad on the President Grant on August 8, the second batch is scheduled to go abroad on the President Hoover on August 11, the third batch is scheduled to go abroad on the Empress of Japan on August 23, the fourth batch is scheduled to depart on the President Cleveland on August 29, and the fifth batch is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the President Jackson on September 1. At that time, in order to facilitate travel, each ship will be led by the Global Student Association to organize a student group and hold a pre-departure study abroad guidance meeting. According to Mr. Wu Deyin of the Global Student Association, many students going to the United States this year have not yet completed the admission permit procedures. With only one month left before the departure date, if they do not hurry up to complete the procedures, they may not be able to go abroad as scheduled. Therefore, those who have not completed the procedures should pay special attention.</p>
