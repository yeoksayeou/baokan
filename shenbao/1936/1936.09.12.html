<p>時評</p>
<h3>英國外交與太平洋安全</h3>
<p>— 隅</p>
<p>太平洋有關係各國的外交政策。依然非常混沌。因為各國政治家不是上帝。不能如上帝那樣「要有光就有了光」。各國政治家也不如軍人。他們以數年之努力締結成功的條約。常被軍人毀於一旦。目前這時代乃毀的時代而非締的時代。歐洲如斯。太平洋亦如斯。歐洲兩個最大軍國主義國家——德意志與意大利。已由拔刀相見的仇人。變而為「刎頸」之交。她們顯然將於未來的一幕全武劇中唱着雙簧戲。英國的包爾溫。和法國里昂白倫。要想把這兩隻出柙之虎。從那無拘束的原野。拉回到羅卡諾那個老押里去。這種痴心妄想。徒見其勞而無功罷了。</p>
<p>歐洲政治氣壓的高與低。不獨關繫着歐洲自身。亦同樣影響着遠東政治。我們知道。在亞洲有一個國家。她不但與歐洲掀動風潮的德國。早巳有了密約。並且她還看風使舵。當歐洲政治氣壓高的時候。暫時停化活動。一到政治氣壓低的時侯。知道歐洲各國忙於自身的糾紛。無暇東顧。或者有些在遠東有切身利害關係的國家。如英國等。到了這時。對於遠東事件。甚至要仰她的鼻息。她就與那些站在同一陣營的與國。唱和起來。而積極向亞洲大陸進攻。五年來的事實。可不是擺在我們的眼前麽。</p>
<p>由上面所述看來。我們已可的略知道。所謂和平。乃是整個而不可分割的。沒有世界和平。决不會有太平洋和平。那些主張限制戰爭於一隅。而自身置於戰爭旋渦之外的。不是愚妄。就是別有用心。東三省事件。如果主持國聯的大國如英法等。早能像美國當時國務卿所暗示的一樣與他合作。而嚴格遵守盟的。實行制裁。使侵略者有所警戒。那末阿比西尼的事件。也許不會發生。國聯威信。也許不至喪失到這樣地步。遠東事件。也許不會糟到這樣程度。而華盛頓九國公約。以及凱洛格非戰公約也許不會像今日一樣變為廢紙。「一著之失。滿盤皆輸。」到了今日。各國政治家。纔想把那已經被刺刀戳破的許多條約。來維持世界和平。恐已於事無補。最顯明的例子。就是這次太平洋學會在美國玉斯美開會討論九國公約時。日本代表芳澤公然以「向華發展為必要」的理由。主張修改九國公約。且以新公約改訂時。倘把「制裁」這等字樣列入。足使日本戚覺「不安」。可見「集體安全」這個概念。不但在事實上早已抹煞。連這樣的思想。也為那些以武力佔領為擴張領士手段的國家所排斥了。在這樣情况之下。世界寧有和平可言。</p>
<p>「集體安全」這概念旣因侵略國的氣燄高張和國聯的喪失威信而消隱下去。那末國聯盟的中所規定的「一切國際條約必須通知國聯而由國聯公佈」的公開外交方式。也必因國聯的無能而無形消滅。舊時秘密外交的盛行於今日。自然是不可避免的事了。</p>
<p>足以左右世界政治的英國。這幾年來在保守黨控制之下。其對歐洲。初則以集體安全相號召。終則在意阿事件中顯露出狼狽醜惡的眞面目來。其對太平洋方面。自始至終。以覓取實利為出發點。正如英國新任駐華大使許智森这次在東京的談話中所說。「英國在華利益。厥為經濟性質。而以貿易為尤甚。」因此英國當前的對華外交政策。我們可以概括地講。就在當此另一國家志在獨吞全中國的局面下。如何保持其貿易的利益。他們知道。在此歐洲多事之秋。他們沒有力量來單獨與東亞的新興勢力較一日之長。所以他們的政策。只要其已得利益受不到過甚的損害。總望能够妥恊。據上月二日東京朝日新聞所載。許智森大使在倫敦時。曾與日本駐英大使吉田會見。就日本對華政治經濟軍事之意向。與英國對華之希望與意向。詳細交換意見。並竭力主張英日在遠東有協力的必要。艾登外相亦完全同意。此雖日人片面的宣傳。但與事實恐也相離不遠。由此我們可以明白羅斯來華。為什麽須先經過日本。羅斯去華。為什麽又得先至東京一行。此次許智森大使來華。為什麽又要先訪問東京政府。就英國的立塲講。這樣的外交政策。也許能使其貿易利益暫時保存幾許。然而五年來的事實告訴我們。在所謂「飛躍」過程下。英人的貿易界限。已有被擠而局於長江流域的趨勢。在這樣的局面下。還要避開了和平的坦道。而牢守着唯實主義的軀壳。恐怕火燄燎原的時候。英國在遠東的處境。將見比意阿事件更加狠狽不堪了。</p>
<h3>德國社會黨大會反俄運動高潮　羅森堡　戈培爾痛詆共產體無完膚　希特勒企力量創新同盟　欲擯蘇聯放著歐洲之外</h3>
<p>紐倫堡　國社黨大會今日舉行「工役」節日慶祝、景象甚形莊嚴、工團四萬五千人集於大校塲中，負鏟擊鼓揚旗作鵝步、經過元首希特勒之前、其中有靑年萬人、皆解衣至腰、觀衆予以狂熱之歡迎、希氏乃向致詞、謂工役者、不啻國社黨訓練之高等學校也、今者馬克斯主義之各國、城鎭被焚、村莊碎裂、階級互鬥、父兄相殺、吾人則取另一途徑、使爾等不分裂而相團結云、旋由宣傳部長戈培爾博士在大會前致詞、警吿世界共起反抗猶太人與布爾希維克主義、戈氏略稱、歐洲之生存、危機已迫、現在吾人宜不問其結果如何、而從事决定應付布爾希維克主義之方針、德意志深信其終有一日、能使世人明瞭猶太人及布爾希維克主義之眞面目也、歐洲如欲恢復其健康之境、則布爾希維克主義必須毀滅而後可、戈氏又稱、布爾希維克主義祗能由猶太人之腦中產生、今日蘇俄政府要員、百分之九十八以上係屬猶太人云、一般人鑒於昨今兩日希特勒及戈培爾二氏反對猶太人及布爾希維克主義之激烈、對於德國是否將長此維持其駐莫斯科之大使、已引起種種揣測云、（十日路透電）</p>
<p>紐倫堡　今晚國社黨常年大會中、國社黨外交組主任羅森堡及宣傳部長戈培爾、均發表長篇演說、痛詆蘇聯與布爾希維克主義、列席大會之各外國人士、對於此項演說、均產生一種重大印象、咸以為此種演說對於布爾希維克主義及蘇俄政制、明白宣戰、將引起何種政治結果、殊有不堪設想者、謠傳德國將與蘇聯絕交、或藉端斷絕外交關係、亦未可知、聞下星期一日國社黨大會正式閉幕時、希特勒元首並將發表演說、重申反布爾希維克主義之見解、若干人士謂希特勒將向歐洲各國提議團結一致、創立新神聖同盟、以反對莫斯科、換言之、卽就政治上摒蘇俄於歐洲之外是也、德國反蘇聯運動之高漲、於此可見、茲摘錄羅森堡及戈培爾之演詞如下、</p>
<p>羅森堡演說</p>
<p>首謂「歐洲前途之生存、賴以作中流砥柱者、今惟德國而已、曩者猶太資本家拉德諾（曾任社會黨內閣外長及建設部長、於一九二二年被剌殞命）謀使德國與蘇俄聯繫、國社黨首先加以反對、今者西班牙優秀份子、方遭恐怖之屠殺、全歐人士、因此更不可不顧念其前途」云、羅森堡繼謂、布爾希維克黨之革命、乃由猶太世界按照預定不變之計劃組織而成、「在莫斯科與瑪德里如出一轍、」倘無猶太人之領導、則决不至有眞正之社會革命、「吾人曩曾親見猶太人在俄德兩國之活動今猶太人復在瑪德里及巴塞洛那（現由政府軍佔領之西班牙要港）驅逐德國僑民矣、……昔西班牙國君斐迪南與伊薩貝拉、驅逐猶太人出境、今猶太入毀滅西班牙敎堂數百所、並流純粹西班牙種之血液、猶太人可謂已復其世仇矣、不寗唯是、所謂布爾希維克主義、實卽下流社會之信條、布爾希維克黨、在政治與軍事上、施其陰謀、僅恃警察與軍隊、已不復能摧毀之、必賴新信仰與行動、方可遏抑布爾希維克主義之毒燄、被自命為保護西方文明者、竟乃容許蘇俄加入國聯會、是不啻恬顏以出賣歐洲文化也、」羅森堡辭畢</p>
<p>戈培爾演說</p>
<p>由宣傳部長戈培爾繼起演說、共措詞、大致與羅森堡相同、略謂、「俄國以外之共產黨、實不啻第三國際在外國所設置之客籍軍隊、故凡共產黨佔有强大勢力之國家、多少不免受史丹林之命令支配、例如西方有一大國焉、與蘇俄訂結協定之後、其國內之共產黨、卽奉莫斯科之訓令、此後不再反對擴張軍備、不再反對通過軍事經費案、其受莫斯料操縱、於此可見一斑矣、共產黨現正準備向德國開戰、且欲使法國牽入戰爭之漩渦、此卽所謂蘇維埃和平政策云、此外戈培爾演說中、更有一節痛詆蘇聯、幾至體無完膚、其詞曰、「布爾希維克主義者、瘋狂犯罪之行為也、蓋此乃猶太人所發明、猶太人所領導、而用以殲滅歐洲文明民族、建立猶太人之國際霸權者也、布爾希維克主義實卽卑鄙之獨裁制度、布爾希維克黨賴欺騙以取得政權、恃暴力以維持政權、……故布爾希維克主義之問題、實卽關係歐洲生死存亡之問題、吾人對於布爾希維克主義、非贊成卽反對、必擇定其一、而不顧一切、至於俄國布爾希維克主義之內部鬥爭、實係猶太人之家庭內變、蓋猶太人野心勃勃、蓄意破壞、至最後自不免互相火併、遂以猶太人而槍殺猶太人也、…今値國社黨大會、吾人特鳴報警之鐘、彼蘇俄者並非勞工之祖國、俄國政府幾完全由猶太人組織而成、其中無一勞工在內、蘇俄並未實行無產階級獨裁、僅屬猶太人獨裁而已、」至是戈培爾復歷舉蘇聯要人之姓名、加以醜詆、謂蘇聯政治警察局長耶哥達。人民交通委員卽史丹林之婿加昂諾維契。以及人民外交委員李維諾夫、其原來姓名、本屬猶太人、後雖改用俄國姓名、實則皆係猶太貧民窟出身云、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>反猶鬥爭賡續進行</h3>
<p>紐倫堡　國祉黨大會本日賡續開會、當由該黨僧城區支部領袖華格納發表演說稱、「或謂關於猶人之法律自去年九月間頒佈以還、我國對猶太問題、業已澈底解决、余應之曰、猶太人仍在賡績鬥爭中、吾國反猶太鬥爭、仍當賡續進行、各國人民若能了解此乃民族生存所關、則最後勝利、卽屬於本黨」云、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>種族法律雷厲施行　貨也巨額婚姻小借款　六十萬人因以有家室</h3>
<p>紐倫堡　內務部長佛里克博士今日在德國公法學家大會演說、謂國社主義之日耳曼擬恪守其種族法律、而不為外國批評家所左右、博士又稱、政府貸出之婚姻小借欵、迄今共達三萬五千萬馬克、而使六十萬人因以有家室、一九三四年中消滅生殖機能者共六百七十二人、一九三五年减至三百二十四人云、（十一日路透電）</p>
<h3>俄捷軍事合作　捷斥德虛搆事實</h3>
<p>捷克京城　德國宣傳部長戈培爾、昨在該國國社黨大會發表演說、曾涉及蘇聯與捷克相互關係、捷克政府頃發表公報稱、「外傳捷蘇兩國已在軍事上成立合作、用以對付某國、蘇聯陸軍並在捷克建有飛機塲、戈培爾君乃竟加以引述、殊可詫異、實則此項消息、盡屬虛搆之詞」云、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>莫斯科報評論　德侵略野心昭然若揭</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）論及希特勒之演說、眞理報云、「希特勒之演說實際乃為一篇供狀、其中包含不少極不利於法西斯蒂本身之供辭、德國領袖前曾揚言、「保障和平」、今則明言克虜伯工廠工作極佳、超過德人之敵、」此非軍備競爭之明證而何、前曾許人民以「法西斯蒂天堂、」今則聲稱某某數種物品將來尙有缺乏之虞、尤其關於食物、此非承認飢饉及營養不足之不良前途而何、</p>
<p>「該演說坦白聲明增加工銀為不可能、此實庫空如洗之政府對菜色滿面之人民之哀吿、今法西黨徒聞及增加工銀之要求卽感覺頭痛、乃聲稱「增加工銀與减少工時為瘋狂舉動、」在法西斯蒂眼光中、固屬如此也、國庫已日漸空虛、現金準備已日漸减少、毫無通貨可買食物、凡此皆因通貨準備之最後一文、業巳用於憤充軍備、</p>
<p>「該演說極少關於外交政策之聲明、但有一點則異常明白、卽德國决不放棄對於殖民地之要求、德國政策之侵略性質、蓋與共人民之飢饉貧困、同為不可掩飾之事實也、「吾人如除去其中反蘇聯欺騙詞語全部、該演說卽一無所有、其所許於德國人民者如何、飢餓。最殘酷之恐怖·戰爭·侵略而已、法西斯蒂大會之開塲第一幕、顯然並未成功，無論用如何之反蘇宣傳及旁敲側擊、均不能救彼等、法西德國之醜惡可怖之現實、已完全透出反蘇調語以及一切欺騙詐術之外、」</p>
<p>消息報社論云、「希特勒之來賓已完全失望、彼等所見乃為陳腐沈悶之一幕、觀過此種表演以後、卽最邊遠之鄕村中最無大志之觀客亦將要求退票矣、消息報駁斥希特勒所稱「德國文化之燦爛、」及「德國之繁榮」後、續論云、「紐倫堡之挿科打渾及空中樓閣、至此已完全截止、希特勒已忘却渠曾以職業的和平擁護者目居、而突然回到「德國人口過剩之狂談、卽其在「我的奮鬥」中已反覆討論者、而用以證明渠之不可免的帝國主義侵略政策為合理、「希特勒未能發表一篇和平的演說、渠祗能申述其侵略政策、吾人必須直言希特勒述及其帝國主義企圖之一部份、實較其毫無內容全屬幻想之前半大文易於理解、且較有條理、」（十日塔斯電）</p>

<p>外國軍事參觀團曾與伏氏討論此决動作、英國代表華維爾將軍云、苟渠未親眼見到、渠不相信此種動作有實行之可能、法國總代表希維斯格特及伏爾明將軍特別注意執行此種極複雜之動作時秩序井然之情形、渠等云、　空中兵士之降落、使人思及許多問題」、捷克代表團及其領袖魯查將軍亦對伏氏表示、渠等對于飛行員及降落傘家所執行之動作、異常欣佩、伏氏指出降落傘家之勇敢、並云、一此决不過平時之訓練、以期使吾可敬之人民更加强健、誠然、在交戰狀况時實施空中降落軍隊尙有討論之餘地、但此種動作實値極端之注意、蓋無疑問也、「十日塔斯電）</p>

<p>楊氏稱、近年以來、我國整個農村、趨於破產、而湖北為巷、不但連年災禍、許多農民、以草根樹皮及觀音土果腹、卽偶遇豐年、又因物價跌落、榖賤傷農、以致終歲勤勞、雖勉得一飽、終亦不能購換衣物、因之歉固成災、豐亦成災、此固由於整個國民經濟、缺乏調整、而農業本身、未切實改良、允為重大因素、現在改良湖北農業、第一口號、為「農業科學化、」與農業工業化、」我國以農立國、而純粹農產品、如米·麥·棉花·烟草·白糖·麵粉及農產製造品、每年由外輸入、値逾六萬萬元、寗不痛心、湖北產棉、每年約為二三百萬擔左右、今年占全國出產第三位、不可謂不多、而外棉還是不斷流入、因棉質較差、故紡二十五枝之紗、仍非參用外棉不可、欲使國棉暢銷、惟有改良棉種、嚴禁攙水攙雜、米麥之本身、同時需要改良、須講求水利、利用新式農具、凡選種。施肥·刈草·除虫·略用科學、自然農產覺收、政府方面、則為之設倉儲藏、設局檢定、提高其品質、嚴定其標準、並健全農村金融組織、將來國內產銷、可望互應供求、舶來品之輸入、自不難斷絕、至如農民耕作時間、一年僅一百二十日農忙、其餘九個月、皆為農暇、農民勞力、可利用向其他事業發展、最好從事農村副業、如園藝方面、果樹·蔬菜·花卉·之栽培、牧畜方面、馬·牛·羊·豕·雞·鴨·蜂·魚·之飼養、工藝方面、如釀土酒·釀醬油·軋花·紡紗·織布·造紙·以及從事籐工·蓆工·編竹·製蔴、且可利用湖沼、捕魚採蓮、利用山地、造林獵獸、此等副業、只須農民勞力、亦卽農民資本、大可帮助農村之復興、第二口號、為農村保甲化、」與「農村合作化、」因為農民知識淺陋、思想頑固、欲推動農業科學化與農業工業化、非有一種切實組織不可、在政治上、為編組保甲、在經濟上、為創辦各種合作社、是為農村最重要之兩大組織、亦可以說、合作為農村經濟上的保甲、血保甲為農村政治上的合作、保甲制度、辦理完善、不但消極方面、可以維持治安、卽積極方面、亦可推進一切建設事業、而各種合作社、便利允多、有信用合作社、則農民可以運用資金、有利用合作社、則凡因改良農作、或農產品加工、須購新式工具、或有關生產之材料、非一入資力能辦者、均可由利用合作社共同出資購置、共同使用經營、以增加生產、有消費及運銷合作社、則凡社員需要之日用品及所生產之農產品、均可自行採辦運銷、直接向市塲買賣、不受商人操縱、此各種合作社、都要在農村中一一創辦起來、第　口號、為「農民集團化、」「農民訓練化、」一面參加壯丁隊·保安隊·義勇隊·一面合力經營造林、築路·防水·防旱、種種建設事業、只用勞力、不費金錢、卽可達到增進生產之目的、今後當照提出的口號、切實施行、</p>
<p>推行鄉政人員</p>
<p>記者復叩以推行六化政策之機關與人員、楊稱人稱縣長為親民之官、實在縣長與百姓接觸機會不多、推行鄉政、必須區長區員、因為區長身處鄉問、一舉一動、均足直接影響一般民衆、其所處之地位、一面為縣長之手足耳目、一面為鄉村建設之領袖、而各鄉聯保主任、與聯保書記、則為鄉村建設之幹部、彼此聯繫、故區長又為承上啟下之樞紐、所負鄉村建設之責任尤為重大、木省應此需要、業已分區設署、不久卽遍及全省、而區政人員之訓練、現已辦至三期、區政訓練之卞旨、在使區政人員、養成「文武兼修、」「君師並作、」以「管·敎·養·衛·」針對民人「散·愚·貧·弱·」之病根、而加以澈底治療、現在行政人員、有四種毛病、第一為妥恊·遷就·與敷衍、第二為因循·萎靡·動作不緊張、精神不振作、第三為粉飾·虛偽、第四為浪費·虛耗·本人勉勵區政人員、為四幹精神，卽以「硬幹」醫妥恊遷就、「快幹」醫因循萎靡、「實幹」醫粉飾虛偽、「苦幹」醫浪費虛耗、如區政人員能本此精神砥礪實行、則區政之成在此、農村復興亦在此矣、（九月十日）</p>

<h3>日水兵案四要犯審訊記　朱貴生否認參預暗殺案　謂內幕須問陳恩明方知　——今日上午將繼續開庭——</h3>
<p>本市公安局、於上月間拘獲揚州人朱貴生·陳恩明·江北人金道權·三名、調查之下、以其對於去年十一月九日夜間竇樂安路發生之日本水兵中山秀雄被人槍傷身死、及本年七月十日旅滬日僑萱生鑛藏被人槍殺兩鉅案、皆有關係、並以朱等曾經供出係在押首都之刺在案內要犯張世民（卽張玉華又名張維）所主使、因特派幹探赴京、將張</p>
<p>移提來滬　旋由公共租界捕房向市公安局將朱·陳·金·張·四人提解至第一特區地方法院審究、關於中山秀雄部份、業已數度開庭偵查、昨日下午、又由蕭爕棻推事與唐檢察官升座第一刑庭、飭提該四人至案、繼續隔別研鞠、當據捕房律師汝葆彝稱、朱·金·陳·三人、均山市公安局逮捕、該三人被捕之情形、以及彼等在公安局如何供述、庭上如需明瞭、則請向市公安局查詢、自經捕房將朱等提到後、朱等在捕房內、</p>
<p>各有口供　但山捕房調查之下、頗與在公安局所供者、多有出入、故究竟應以何方面供詞為可信、似未便臆測、要唯以今日當庭所訊得者、最為重要矣、就若輩之供詞而言、不獨對於已發生之兩案有重大嫌欵、抑且尙有再演第三案之企圖、庭上審究之後、如認朱等對於中山秀雄一案、實無關係、則卽將若輩送回公安局、反之、則捕房仍當</p>
<p>繼續調查　也云云、庭上遂向朱貴生訊據供稱、二十二年八月、山原籍來滬、在浦東做工、决年正月、失業回籍、至去年四月、友人孫文德函允謀事、故又携同眷屬前來、寓赫德路福德坊孫家、因孫之妻父、與我有舊、孫乃相留、目按月給我生活費三十元、嗣悉孫為華克之黨羽、該欵華氏命孫給付、當時孫並云華若</p>
<p>由港來滬　當可為我謀事、直至去年十月、孫始停止給欵、張世民係在孫家相識、陳恩明係屬同鄉、彼於去年九月、亦係來滬謀事、我在捕房所供去年十一月九日在海寗路海寗旅館房內聞張世民囑咐陳恩明往打死日本水兵及手槍、係由石鳳亭帶去等語、均與被公安局逮捕時、在公安局內所供相同、實則十一月九日下午、我郵寄匯票信回籍之後、旋覺寄信手續錯誤、卽於晚間六時、離海寗旅館而赴北四川路郵局、及將手續補正、已七時餘、正在該局門外、候乘電車、適陳恩明亦自海寗旅館來、據陳對我言、</p>
<p>與陳銘樞　有關係、我前曾服務偵緝隊、外問不無仇人、後又在籍販土以不容於鄉里、逃避至滬、茲乃被仇敵石金山等所害、指我參加華等所組暗殺團之暗殺工作、最近八月三日、華克之雖着金道權邀我往北四川路儉德公寓晚餐、並有所引誘、但我則未與合作等語、繼訊之陳恩明供、去年廢歷九月來滬、初寓朱貴生家、張世民係在朱家會見、彼曾詢我</p>
<p>諳槍術否　至十一月八日、張邀往遊玩、遂同赴海寗路海寗旅館、張則與石鳳亭談話、音細不聞、是夜我宿於該旅館、次日張携一小皮箱來、以箱付石時、朱亦在座、並囑我勿洩漏、嗣朱因補正郵匯手續往郵局、我亦繼出、相遇於郵局門首之電車站、我祇對朱言石鳳亭已經去做、未說石已成功、該水兵是否為石所害、我殊不知、近據石金生云、華克之於本年八月二日、尙至朱貴生家、又謂去歲之日水兵、乃華等所害、此决又將有</p>
<p>同樣舉動　但石金生昔充士匪時、朱貴生為偵緝員、彼此係屬仇敵、去年十一月十日、張世民見我衣單身寒、特贈四元製衣、並非任何酬報等語、旋由狄思威路西探長克勞特報吿調查海寗旅館之情形一過、　之張世民供、與朱·陳·等吿不相識、今朱·陳·均供會見我面、或者彼等固知我也、與華克之係同鄉、王亞樵亦相識、我對刺在案、</p>
<p>誠有嫌疑　但於本案實無關係、不料朱·陳·供詞、均相牽涉、復聞箱上與手槍上皆有我之指模、是則人說物證俱備、我之犯罪、似無可推卸、事誠駭異之至、蓋殺害日水兵之事、我尙係被提至滬公安局始知、故絕對未嘗參加云云、時已五句鐘、蕭推事論令改期（今日）上午再訊、朱等四人　押、</p>

<p>為友奔走</p>
<p>上月之杪、王君忽因案被捕、現羈押於公共租界捕房、尙未定讞、當時郭女士聞斯消息、為知　　德起見、乃為王君出而奔走、各方求援、並曾兩度致函商界某君、請求主張公道、</p>
<p>有人探訪</p>

<p>仁義善會、致財產以前洋貨商業公會執管、改振新俱樂部後、移交管理、改組仁義善會、交仁義善會經管、但公會地基、當初由樂振葆先牛經手買下、因道契關係、故用樂名義道契、以前交貝潤生保管、現在山瑞康號保管、致於恒利銀行與公會是銀錢存放關係云云、至此、由被吿袁漢雲律師中述意見、謂今日代表人馬尙傑有無</p>

<h3>陳健民談國防與精神學</h3>
<p>中國精神研究會陳健民談、國防之要件、在積極方面、為戰鬭力之發揮、戰鬭之力量、在一方面視之、雖關於武器及體格、而根本則全賴精神作用以為轉移、上兵攻心、古有明訓、物質之力量小、精神之力量大、總理已於軍人精神敎育之演詞中昭示於衆矣、今日軍事長官、每注意物質條件之準備、鄙人深願軍隊於技術訓練之外、更輔以精神訓練、關於軍人精神訓練、本會正在擬具具體計劃、行將呈請軍事當局採用、此關於積極方面者也、至消極方面、尙須防制戰鬭力之减少、若遇士兵受傷或染疾病、雖有普通軍醫負責治療、惟一旦遇有戰時精神神經病發生、則非用精神療法不可、而現在我國軍隊、尙無此種專門醫師、歐戰時、法蘭西高等神經病院、首先採用精神療法、當時聘請英國心理學家布拉文博士為醫官專治此症、成續最著、卽布氏一人在院用精神療法而治愈之戰時情神神經病、數在三千名以上、其他病院、此項病兵之數、尙不在內、可見此症在戰時之重要、故精神學對於國防之任何方面、均有重大關係、深願國人羣起而研究之云云、</p>

<h3>（六）（十）籃球第四週兩幕大戰</h3>
<p>大會籃球賽進到第四週時、祗餘八隊、分四組比賽、其中最使人注意的、當然是美國對菲列濱、加拿大對烏拉圭、（另兩組墨西哥勝義大利三十四比十七、波蘭勝秘魯、秘魯秦權）這兩幕比賽都移到大籃球塲舉行、下午五時美國對菲列濱、六時加拿大對烏拉圭、但是歐洲人對籃球興趣、不能其他運動之熱烈、所以這兩幕精彩大戰、作壁上觀者僅一千人、</p>
<p>美國隊痛擊菲列濱</p>
<p>美國為籃球隊發源地、技術高超、自不待官、然菲列濱亦久為遠東盟主、實力未可厚非、作戰前勝敗雖早有定論、但一般均信菲列濱必能予美國以極大之威脅、果然、上半時菲隊全軍用命、不屈不撓、僅以八分之差落後、下半時、美國隊憑其高大之身材、迅捷之動作、表演精彩百出、菲隊還手無力、遂一收塗地、</p>
<p>裁判一聲令下、兩隊列陣對圓、美國中鋒福登勃雷、身高六呎允吋、菲隊麥森相差一頭、中圈跳球、美隊占盡便宜、兩三傳遞、左衛灰晚萊衝進菲營、舉手一揚、球已直穿網窩、打開紀錄、福登勃雷遠挪不中、右鋒强森追上縱身一拍、再建一功、菲隊得球反攻、左鋒勃爾克籃下初試身手、中的而返、福登勃雷籃下搶球、如探囊取物、輕輕一放、不差分毫、六比二、美隊占先、諾爾斯與馬丁納斯各為本隊罰進一分後、福登勃雪强森又先後中的、十一比三、相差愈遠、菲隊亡命反攻、馬丁納斯罰球得分後、派迭拉麥森又相繼騙過最後防綫、扳回四分、勃爾克兩罰不中、大為洩氣、反之、美國隊精神白倍、愈戰愈勇、灰脫萊出將人相、福登勃雷亦百步穿揚、派迭拉埋伏美軍陣地、雖輕輕打進一球、然史璜生兩决遠投、又成十九比十、菲軍改變戰略、着地傳球、美軍灣腰艱難、竟被勃爾克派迭拉兩破網窩、美軍亟以勒格蘭出代史璜生、後防益見穩固、三前鋒出沒敵陣、聲勢汹汹、菲隊勉力追隨、不屈不撓、上半時二十八比二十、美軍小勝、休息再戰、菲軍體力不濟、已成强弩之未、美軍游力有餘、愈戰愈勇、後防堅固、有如金湯鐵壁、前綫陷陣如入無人之境、連罰帶　、加上九分、菲隊始由馬丁納斯罰進一分、此後美軍連珠發砲、頓加十三分、直殺得菲隊頭昏眼花、招架無術、勃爾克千辛萬苦、籃下偷得一球、那經得强森諾爾斯再三摧殘、下半時美軍仍得二十八分、菲軍祗得三分、結果五十六對二十三、美國大勝、裁判伊絲蘭、</p>

<h3>後巿買氣突緊棉花爭轉上騰</h3>
<p>棉市初以天氣晴朗、而外棉平疲趨下、繼以市傳各路產地市價高昂、寗波姚花價飛漲二元之說、於是空頭紛起抵補、市價乃復上騰矣、</p>
<p>標花再漲四角</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、以美棉始漲繼跌、結果漲跌互見、上下一至九磅音、印棉跌一羅比二五、大阪三品花跌三四角、本埠天氣放晴、凉風習習、人心稍萎、塲中買氣不濃、各月均跌二·三角、但入後浮戶抵補、中途上下五分至一角、澄記·大孚·裕大·明德·賡豐·興昌·同和·生源等均賣出、惟長和努力購進一萬担外、潤康·永昌·大豐·長豐·信誠補空、加碼並起、結果各月比上日收盤價跌二三角、午後開盤市况極其緊佾、傳某銀行總經埋就任財政要職之說、由此買氣殊急、盤盤上升、結果各月比上午收盤價均漲五角半至六角半、查賣出澄記一萬担、大孚九千担、德大三千四百担、愼記三千三百担、泰昌四千五百担、信誠三千八百担、益昶二千六百担、興昌二千六百担、生源二千四百担、同和三千一百担、買進福康五千担、大昶二千五百担、大豐二千三百祖、大昌成四千七百担、潤康八千四百担、永昌三千一百担、長和一萬零五百担、合興三千担、豐泰四千二百担、仁豐五千担、一日間最高低價列左、</p>

<p>（附記紗布交易所倉庫中存紗二十支三萬多包亦計算在內）</p>
<h3>美棉巿價近堅遠疲</h3>
<p>昨美棉開盤、各月由不動至漲二磅音、晨初因上日收盤時棉農套賣、交易遲疑、旋以同業及利物浦帮買進、市價上漲、近月空戶、大半移至遠月、因之近堅遠疲、將收盤前、套賣增加、漸生反動、現需靜寂、收盤平穩、計現貨不動、期貨跌九磅音至漲三磅音、英棉現貨跌四點、期貨跌一二點、印棉多頭了結為補空所吸收、旋棉商跨買、又為多頭了結所推翻、計平果爾跌一·二五羅比、奧　辣跌一羅比、白　溪跌一·二五羅比、原電錄左、（十一日電）</p>

<h3>糧食　業外稍有吸進　麵粉先挫後回</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份大致平平、因洋麥報價、雖見微好、惟北路實銷、依然淸寂、故各盤交易、故呈盤旋、比較前日收價、計回跌七厘半左右、迨至下午開盤、初尙不動、後因業外多頭、又稍吸進、廠方之套貨、亦大致觀望、是以交易雖未大暢、喊價已提起近分、業中人之推測、以為目下芷値粉銷旺令、如果北銷淸淡如常、各廠積滯之時、近期仍有壓小之勢云、</p>
<h3>麥巿一度岑寂　午後因漢帮吸進略好分許</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤、各月份平寂如常、開價有起色者甚少、與前日大致相仿、迨至下午開盤、各月份交易較暢、買氣絞活、因傳漢口帮以該處麥價見提、故標準微有吸進、人心遂見挺住、較前日好一分、現麥仍然平穩、廠胃較淡、開明光五河麥四元九角半、竹鎭麥四元七角六分、宿遷麥四元八角六分、决八角二分、江北麥四元七角七分、次六角三分、蔣家壩麥四元八角三分、决八角、高郵麥四元七角二四分、烏衣麥四元八角三分、南京麥四元七角半、瑤灣麥四元八角九分、台州麥四元七角八分、由福新辦三千包、阜豐辦一千五百包、申大辦一千包云、</p>

<h3>河下米巿平疲如故</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源、較前轉多、共到二十五六號、貨共五千餘石、而本街銷塲又屬呆滯、包胃雖有靑島大連兩帮辦五百餘包、然結果仍難維持、厚薄粳行情小去幾分、東新粳到貨雖未見旺、但北市新到崑山貨五儎、致未免受其影響、價低一角、杜洋等新尖走化轉懈、亦短近尺、陰　元平庸、</p>

<h3>日商暢辦中菜籽漲風頗為劇烈　黃豆次貨廠需尙旺</h3>
<p>菜籽交易、新有日本一路銷塲、市况本不易重大發展、近日因油類原料各色俱漲、菜籽亦為該國維一要品、故辦胃甚暢、市價逐形堅俏、上旬中聞平湖貨自九元八九角漲至十元零一角、成交二千餘包、昨市再度上翔、漲至十元零二角、成交一千包、刻下祗有平湖貨尙有少數存貨應市、故漲風依然頗烈、新黃豆到銷兩平、行情無甚軒輊、共開各豆三千七百餘包、大勢高貨價高、故廠家祇就進辦上中關之貨、前途趨勢、暫少捉摸云、</p>
<h3>南北貨　興化新桂圓首批到三千餘件　蒒莊貨猛跌六元</h3>
<p>新桂圓近以到貨漸增、而首批新興華圓、昨亦運到三千餘箱、故號盤趨勢　軟、開跌二三元不一、成交一千六百餘箱、同時行方售盤為欲推廣銷路起見、如頂極天極天宏出辦等篩莊貨、一律均降六元、聞生晒圓肉亦小三元許云、</p>

<h3>五金　英鋼板軋缺飛漲</h3>
<p>英鋼板近日市貨缺乏、外洋到貨又少、而客戶及廠家、需求反見增加、故頗有軋缺之象、行情因之飛漲、如二厘半沽十元、五厘八元半、七厘半八元、一分七元五角、厚花色七元一二角、比之先前、市盤挺起四五角不等、查昨市售出共有四五百担之多云、</p>

<h3>婦女在社會上服務急應爭取機會的平等</h3>
<p>— 振華</p>
<p>自從婦女運動發生以來，在社會上各方面的女子，都獲得了一部分的利益。但是因為法西斯蒂主義的空氣一天比一天濃厚；同時在全社會上政治，經濟等，都陷於一種不景氣然態中，所以婦女運動也就無形停滯了。</p>
<p>婦女的要求解放，達到與男子同等的地位，第一步是要取得敎育上和經濟上的平等，這是每個入都知道而且毫無疑義的一個問題。但是我等獲得了遺產的繼承權，有富裕的金錢；取得了敎育機會平等，造成了高深的學識，而社會不容許我們去利用它，實習它，那末費了若干心血與困難才換得的東西，對於我們又有什麼用處呢？我們願意將爭取得來的東西輕輕的扔了嗎？不，這是决不行的，我們應當取得男女在社會上服務機會的平等，將我們所得來的東西，貢獻到社會去，使全人類都能因我們而到得幸福。</p>
<p>但是，事悄是不會像想像那麼容易的，因為失業者的加多，剛剛踏上了服務道路的女職員們，佔據了男職員的位置，他們不得不呼着女子的做事好像是花瓶似的，只能作裝飾。我們固然不能袒護自己，絕對反對別人的批評，可是，我們絕對不相信男職員們每個都具有豐富的智識？能够盡忠服務。</p>
<p>姊妹們我們應當明白男女的平等？决不是空喊可以成功的，我們必須採用實際的方法去履行。因此在社會上我們不得不要求男女服務機會的平等！去打破那種束縛的寄生生活。但是，我們如何去取得這種平等呢？我想世事都是人為的，只要每個人肯下决心，沒有辦不到的道理。這裏就個人的管見寫下兩點。</p>
<p>（一）養成實際的精神　一個人的成功，全靠在遵循着愚笨的途徑硬幹下去：取巧的成功是偶然的，是帶有危險性的。因此，在求時代，我們養成實際精神，去獲得眞實的學問，庶幾學業成就以後為社會錄用，在服務時秉着實際的精神，努力幹去，那麼，是不是會被人辭退嗎？</p>
<p>（二）接除浮華虛榮的修飾浮華虛榮的修飾，不但消耗時間，虛擲金錢，並且容易引起人們的反感，發生輕視的心理。</p>
<p>上面所述的二點並不是苛求，假使我們能够做到，相信，男女在社會服務的機會平等，一定可以達到，並且能够永遠持續下去。</p>
<h3>世界婦女名人傳（三）</h3>
<p>— 魯沙白</p>
<p>和柯倫泰齊名而任蘇聯人民財政委員長的是瓦爾瓦拉，雅科烏列夫，她牛於莫斯科，為人沉毅寡言，性情和靄和柯倫泰那樣超羣不覊的性格完全兩樣。她於一千九百四十年入黨，一千九百一十年被捕，判處流刑四年，中途逃走，亡命海外。二年後潛回國內；一千九百十三年又被捕，流徙到阿爾罕格利斯克凡三年之久，她在莫斯科也曾被捕過數决，坐過幾回牢；像她這樣始終奮鬥到底的女性，眞是罕見的了。</p>
<p>她不像一般的政治家那樣善於辭令，也不尙空談，祗知埋頭作實際的工作，因此她任職五年，能謹守職責，很得全國人民的信仰。</p>
<p>從製本所女工出身的有尼古萊夫，從裁縫店當學徒而做到黨中央委員會婦女部長的有·亞歷山大拉，阿爾杜錫那·她生長在貧苦的家裏，母親是一個沒有受過敎育的紡織女工，她在十歲的時候，僅受過小學敎育，後因家貧輟學，出外帮助她母親做工。</p>
<p>她在靑年時就在這暗淡工廠中度過了她的靑春，與一切人生應有快樂，物質的享受完全隔絕，每日嚙着黑麵包，她對於這種可詛咒的社會已潛伏着反抗的决心。她與柯倫泰，雅科烏列夫等智識份子不同，不是由理論出發，而是從她的實生活中來參加運動的。她曾被選為彼得堡職工會幹部，二十歲時，已成為一個重要的黨員。十月革命前　曾被捕入獄，判處流刑，她不像一般女性充滿着感傷氣分，幼年的窮苦生活和參加革命後恐怖的流徙的生活，使她磨練成鐵一般的性格，什麼女人的嬌態，男女的戀愛，在她完全是沒有的。</p>
<p>這樣性格的她在亂世中固然可以算是一個英雄，但當蘇聯走進第二决五年計劃，社會生活得到了相常安定的今日，她這樣的人是已失去她的存在的意義。她曾被選為中央人民委員候補委員和婦女部長决長，後又升任婦女部長，但現已取銷。政治的地位也一天天低落了。</p>

<h3>日本新婦女副業的一種法蘭西人像</h3>
<p>— 髮</p>
<p>日本原來以製玩具出名的，日本女子在家裏，沒有事情做的時候，便做着布製的洋囝囝，給弟弟妹妹玩着·最近流行的法蘭西人像，是從法國學來的。經研究改良之後，又將成為日本特有的玩具了。最初也不過是供小孩子玩玩而已，後來製造精美，材料高貴。便成了家庭室內的裝飾品和大商店橱窗裏的點綴物。銷路很大，製作者每月有二三百元的收入，於是成了日本新婦女副業的一種。</p>
<p>普通的洋囝囝的面孔手足，不是賽璐珞的，便是磁質泥質的，容易陂壞，呆板而無生氣。並且都是用複雜的機器製成，家庭中很難仿造。現在流行的法蘭西人像，是全身都用薄綢彩緞做成，普通用木製的玻璃匣子保藏，恐千百年後，仍是完好如新的。</p>
<p>人像的面孔，比較最難製造。用肉色或白色的薄絹，糊在幾層紗布上面，在潮濕的時候，放在鐵製的模型中壓着。乾燥後取出，便成了一個美麗的鵝蛋臉。耳鼻口目，都用顏色繪畫，於是可以仿着照片，畫成種種不同的面孔。大都用電影明星和女優的模型為多。女孩子的模型，當然是最可愛的鄧波兒了。面孔的大小，關係於全身的長短，所以面孔的種類很多，可以任意製造。商店出售的面孔，每個自七八角至一二元不等。家庭中能自己製造，就便利而經濟了。</p>
<p>頭髮是用生絲製造的，染着各種顏色，也可以燙成捲曲的波浪。四肢手脚和身體也是用肉色或白色的薄綢製成，中間塞着棉花，便能包滿充實。用各種鉛絲支持着，做成窈窕的曲綫美。衣服裝飾，更無一定的標準，均可隨心所欲，隨意配置的。此種法蘭西人像，原來都是外國女子的形狀，現在已可以改成日本裝，高髻和服，拖着一雙小木展，怪有趣的。倘若再一改變而成為中國裝束，截髮旗袍，我想在中國一定也可流行起來的。根本方法是相同的，不論男女老幼，任何民族都可製造。</p>
<p>人像的面孔四肢及一切衣帽履物裝飾，均有零售。不能自己製造的，便可買了零件，自行配製。並且大公司均按期舉行講習會，敎授方法，所以學習的人漸多，成為女子的副業。法蘭西人像的價格，自二三元起至數百元不等，大都供室內裝飾及禮物餽送為多。自經商店作為橱窗點綴之後，來往的人，莫不駐足而觀的。</p>
<h3>海濱婦女生活</h3>
<p>— 摩尼</p>
<p>在現社會中對於婦女問題，各有其說，一說女子總是依軟男子，一說男女要共同負担生活，又說女子回到家庭裏去，對於那一個問題為善，我不敢瞎說，我不願女子給商人利用上的做商業幌子，不願女子回到家庭裏去飯後忙着五百剷。姑且來談談海濱的婦女生活。</p>
<p>黃海海濱的婦女，都很凄苦，伊們丈夫大都煮鹽捕魚的。所得到的生活費，說也可憐，那裏能够顧全妻子孩子的吃喝，吃的東西，多以山芋粉充飢，雖則伊們的生活如此的困苦，也不怨天允人，因為海中水產甚豐，伊們每天蹲在海灘上挑鮮貨，據說，「每天可得四百文，因為家裏孩子多，男人做一天工，也只有幾百文，所以我們做些輕便的事，輔助生活。」</p>
<p>像這樣自願的幫助丈夫生產的婦女，也是不可多得的，而且伊們的丈夫沒有常年工作的，而伊們終年不息的存工可做，雖在秋汎時期，每產海蜇，不用挑鮮，但是田間種植棉花，需人耗草，於是伊們捏着鐵剷在强烈的熱光下耙草，每天可得大洋兩角，生活困難的家庭，能够得到細微的幫助，也不無小補，以勞力而生活，終不致於挨餓的的　這等婦女不識一個字，且頭腦很簡單，更且在極艱難的環鏡裏，出賣勞力輔助丈夫生活，比了都市裏專知吃喝裝飾的婦女有點意義了。</p>
<h3>不良環境</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>好好的種子往往被風雨所摧殘</p>
<h3>阿比西尼亞的婚俗（上）</h3>
<p>— 惟經</p>
<p>在阿比西尼亞的婚姻制度之下，女子的命運，是絕對沒有自行選擇之權的。女子的婚姻權，是由父親一入作主的。父親已把女兒許給了人家，不啻已把女兒的命運判定了，是絕對的對於女兒的願意與吾，不加考慮的。在女兒出嫁之前的一二天，新娘的父親，例須備治筵席。這種筵席，大率都是大量的生牛肉，用醬油煎煮的醃羊肉，麥片與牛油混合的東西，不發酵的麵包等等。而這些東西之中，大率都是加入性質强烈的士酒的。當坤宅這麼盛筵欵客時，新郞的親友，也總是同時而且同樣的欽宴着新郞。</p>
<p>結婚的那天新郞由親友陪伴着，騎騾而往坤宅。為顯示他們到達的禮節起見，得嗚放一排槍，及跳一陣戰爭之舞。既畢，乃大隊的擁入坤宅的屋子裏。在那裏，坤宅的全家，（新娘除外），以及親友們，都已在恭候着了　　新郞旣到岳家，岳家得給預備一個座位。這種座位，普通都是在靑草紮成的傘蓋之下的。旣就座　坤宅便請新郞飲宴。（餚饌與前述的相仿。）飲宴既畢，與新郞同來的親友，尙須鳴放一次排槍，及一次戰爭之舞之後，穿着長袍，遮着白厚布面罩的新娘，才由女儐相引入，坐在預設的一個長橙上，靜聽着伊父親報吿着所贈給伊的妝奩。這種妝奩，普通總是些牲畜，家具，農具等等。</p>
<p>新娘的父親，報吿既畢，於是新郞新娘，並肩而立在傘蓋下面，由新娘的父親，問新郞是否願意以他的女兒為妻。新郞便把小指，勾着新娘的小指，這便是表示着願意的意思。簡單的結婚，就算完畢了。接着，是牧師的祝福。若一時找不到牧師時，祝福之舉，由年長的親戚舉行。完畢之後，繼之以舞蹈。於是新娘騎騾而往夫家，再舉行一回簡單的儀式。</p>

<h3>鄧裕芝女士談勞工福利事業</h3>
<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>近世產業發達的國家，對於勞工福利事業，都有精密周詳的設施。譬如說某種產業，齊方只圖近利，不顧勞方生活的安全與健康衛生的保障，其結果必致兩敗俱傷。我們中國的產業，不能與工業先進國比擬，所以勞工福利事業，也是瞠乎其後；俗說水漲船高，暫時要講怎樣辦理這些勞工事業，未免言之過早。可是目前我國勞工的情形，大家應該明瞭一些，我為了這　問題，會和服務於中華基督敎女靑年會全國協會，主持勞工部有十年經騐的鄧裕芝女士，在她一席談話中，可以窺見一斑。</p>
<p>在未談本題之前，先得介紹鄧女士的略歷，給讀者一個認識。她是湖南長沙人，金陵女子大學社會學系畢業後，就在會裏擔任學生部幹事，不上三年，調入勞工部，民國十八年由會派赴日本歐美考察勞工福利事業，Welfare　work特別注意·英·美·德·日·瑞五國，費了五個月時光，得到很多寳貴的資料，常時曾撰長篇報告書，可是沒有公開發表。到了英國，復在倫敦大學經濟學院研究一年，回國後仍任原職。她對於勞工福利事業，觀察很透澈，而且慨乎言之，我知讀者一定會非常感動的。</p>
<p>她說：「我所說的各國勞工狀况，雖是前六年的事，但據最近調查報吿，除德國外，無多大變更，所以我把舊事重提了：（一）當時日本的工會，已經很活動，組織也嚴密，一般工人敎育程度，比我國工人高，由資方主辦的勞工福利，與英美無甚區別，如工人的救濟，娛樂，食宿補習敎育等，都有相當成效。（二）美國的工會，以前分作兩派：一派是A．F．L．全是美國生畏的工人，思想很守舊，歧視外籍工人，華工也給他們排斥的。一派是I．W．W這一派對外籍工友，一視同仁，內部很有組織，所辦工人的敎育，娛樂，救濟等事業也很多。大概美國工會的福利事業，分作兩種：一是廠方主辦的，一是工人自辦的；前者使工人生活安定，無須組織工會，减低勞方與資方對抗的意識，分散工人組織的力量。後者是智識較高的工人，自己辦理一切福利事業，不願給資方有計劃的操縱，兩者各有利弊。美國的產業特別發達，所以工人福利事業也比各國究善。（三）德國當時的工會規模極大，他們自己辦報紙辦學校，由小學至大學，都很完備，後來政制變更，如今工會的大權，操諸國社黨，其情况當然今非昔比了。英國工廠法實施的情形，也一度考察過，他們工會的組織很嚴密，工人敎育與訓練，不在美國之下，工人活躍的情形，不及美國，這就可看到兩國民族性不同的地方。</p>
<p>這裏我要談談我國工人的福利事業，可以分作幾點說：（一）在中國站在工人本身利益的立塲來辦理工人的福利事業，可說極為少數，固然我們也不能和外國來比，外國工會不屬任何一黨，工會是工人經濟鬥爭的方式，如爭工資，工作時間，同時也脫不了政治的活動。（二）實施工人敎育，提高工人智識程度大家認為迫切的事，不過工人敎育，應由何方辦理，倒是値得研究的問題。在英國是社會上第三者，尤其是熱心工大敎育的學者，辦理工人敎育；在資本主義社會裏，以英國的工人敎育辦得最好，你可以和每一個勞工談談國際問題，或是政治問題，都很能對答，我想一位中學生，恐怕也難能吧？中國現在能有社會上第三者（不是政府也不是工人）來辦工人敎育，的確很需要。（三）中國工廠的工作時間，比任何　國都長，普通總是十小時至十二小時，而待遇很苦，不要說教育，就是健康也都不行。他們的精神與時間，都不容許你受敎育的洗禮，現在政府要實施工廠法，减少工作時問，實為重要的先决問題之一。（四）男工苦，女工更苦，由各種產業工人統計表看來，女工比男工衆多，而已嫁的女工，除工廠工作外，有家庭瑣事，她們常减少睡眠的時問，來完成她每天的職務。逢到生產的前後，不能多請假，更覺得苦痛，此種塲合，應用政治力量，促成廠方辦理托兒所，及生產前後加長休假期，但恐不易辦到，因廠方亦有苦衷，反使廠方感到雇用女工的損失。照目前的情形，女工本身沒有健康的生活，而影響到子女的體格，這是很嚴重的問題。我們從國家民族在立塲來說，實不能隨便讓人它過去的。因工人佔都市市民的最大多數，要是工人一家都不健康，這項損失是大得可怕的。疾病原是人生苦事，然而貧目病的工人，那苦痛便可想而知。像上海這麼大的都市，免費及减費的醫院，完全沒有，卽使有一二公立醫院，同樣的有綫人才可以療病，窮人休想能進門。工人生了病，工資停給，已屬損失，而家用增加，再納醫藥費，事實上是不能久待的，因此生病的工人，精神物質，兩重壓迫，於是，往往由小病而人病，大病而死亡，也有初次病愈，因勞頓而復發，這是多麼傷心的事！我是與女工們最接近的一個人，平素耳聞目見，都是　些事，弄得愛莫能助，困難萬分。此外工人失業，也是頂重大的問題，所以我覺得勞工的一切，都不是單純的問題，在現階段的中國，尤其需要緊念解决的！」</p>
<h3>請求指導節育經過</h3>
<p>— 澄子</p>
<p>因為生產孩子的緣故，失業將近一年了。</p>
<p>孩子產下後，對於怎樣可以節育這一問題是再也不敢因循。</p>
<p>偶然地在醫院的掛號處看到婦立科附有指導生育和節制生育和一科，時間是每星期四的午後，那天恰巧是輪値日，我便掛了號，到候診室去請求指導怎樣節制生育。</p>
<p>候診室裏已坐有許多人，我也不知是否都是來受敎節育方法的。輪着我掛的號類，我便被喊進去了。一個女孩子，大約是醫學院那面的實習女生——把我領到裏面的一間去，開始盤問我的經期，生育决數等，我吿知她一切現象都好，上一個孩子生產後還只三個月，她像是很詫異的望了我一眼，就說：『你不要生產孩子麼？那末，你在外面等一會，醫生還沒有來。』說着，她拿了另一張診視單又去喊別的名字了。我跟在她的背後走出，許多人的眼光都集中在我身上，像想探問一下裏面的消息似的，可是我沒有給她們滿足，我悄然地也坐到她們中間去了。</p>
<p>以後，一個一個的進去又出來，只是挨不着我。這樣，大約待了二點鐘模樣，我的名字又被喊着了。一個男孩子——我大約沒有侮辱他，因為那完全不像是一個醫生的模樣，雖然也穿着白外套，他敎我坐下，開始問我要節育的原因，以後便二的詢問我的家庭狀况，經濟情形，都塡在一個表上。塡好，他向我笑了笑，道：『你外面再坐一會吧，等一等再喊你進來。』看上去，好像節育所應備以條件都適合了，這使我快樂得很。我高興地又從新跑到外面去。</p>
<p>等了沒多久，我是又被喊進去了，這時才看到有一個醫生，他大略地又問了問我不要生育孩子的原因，便領我人了診室。看議敎我睡到病床上，病床很高，睡了上去，那幾個男女孩子便都圍攏來看醫生對我的診察。我害怕得很，我有自己是砧上肉似的感覺。那醫生用洋文向那些學生作着生理上的指示，以後，便敎我怎樣使用子宮帽。那所謂子宮帽只是像小茶杯那末的個薄橡皮做成的東西，使用的方法很簡便，只要將那東西完全放入陰道就是了。那醫生還開了一個方子，敎我去買藥，那藥便在子宮帽使用的時候放在子宮帽裏。我從病床上爬下來，醫生們也就都走到外面去，我獨自地站着整理衣衿，這時，那看護已將剛才試用過的一個子宮帽包好，還另外拿了一瓶牙膏似的錫管裝的東西，一瓶遞給我道：『這東西，你拿去、五塊錢，藥另外一元。』我的人不禁一怔，我身上是恰恰有六塊錢，只是這六塊錢却是下半月的生活費，我實在不敢貿貿然就給我了她。（聽說在公開節育的國家，一個子宮帽的價格只有二毛錢上下。）我吿訴她我沒有帶夥那末多的錢。她說！『那末，你明來來拿吧。』我說，『好的。』出了醫院，我覺着很是茫然。</p>
<p>晚上，將日間的經過吿訴了丈夫，他說：『你就去拿吧，應承了別人，不拿怎麼行？』</p>
<p>但是我總躊躇，六塊錢於我究竟是很大的一個數目，第二天，我終於沒有去拿。對於一個因為養不起孩子而不敢生育的婦人，這避孕的用具眞是太貴了。我只能讓人第二個孩子的陰影　是重重的壓在人頭。</p>

<p>性器發育不全，則患者性器萎頹，纖小猶如孩童，健全之性生活旣無從行使，則有虧夫則，難饜妻望，家庭幸福喪先，子嗣更屬無份，</p>
<p>本症如不速治，有碍於健康及壽命均至巨，其危害不亞於早洩，陰萎也，蓋性小，早洩，陰痿，俱屬生殖腺衰頹所引起之性神經衰弱症，倘不早療，則寢假而引起腦神經衰弱，脊髓神經衰弱，於是衰病蜂起，百症雜呈，挽救更大費週章矣，</p>
<p>上列三大性病，邇來罹者甚衆，如施行電療，勵行攝生，役服性病名劑「生殖素」，莫不得手應心，霍然而治，</p>
<p>其有夙患遺精滑精白濁等症而致引起性小，早洩，陰痿者，則當同時分別加以澈底根治，「希米脫氏固精片」為專治遺精滑精聖劑，「安敵淋」為根治五淋白濁要藥，患者均可依法自行治療也，</p>
<h3>手淫斵喪重獲發育</h3>
<p>— 賈治中醫師</p>
<p>患者湯君，年已廿七歲，而性器纖小有如孩童，余詰悉其因少時曾犯劇烈之手淫，耗傷過度，以致無從發育，全身肌肉亦瘦削可慘，卽矚向永安公司購服「生殖素」以培補共生殖腺，性器頓形發育，肌肉亦自壯茁，不惟血旺神足，體重力强，且生機重萌，再返靑春，校之　昔，判若兩人，不啻重生再造云。</p>
<h3>遠年胃痛一旦根治</h3>

<h3>乳峰臀部健美之獲得</h3>
<p>— 劉志民醫師</p>
<p>愛美女子其鑒諸！</p>
<p>西哲有言：「女子惟健乃眞美」！於此可知美而不健，則直一病西施耳，北美焉不永？惟健而美者，則肌肉壯實，曲線畢露，乳峰豐腴，臀部高聳，庶合於時代之健美標準，</p>
<p>按女子之健美與否，可以乳峰發達與否為斷，而乳峰之發達與否，又可於生殖腺壯盛與否為其準繩，蓋生殖腺不惟直接有關乎子嗣，月經，即對於乳腺，靑春，健美，無不有莫大之影響，是故如何完實其生殖腺，當為欲求取健美之女子所追求而企望者也。</p>
<p>生殖腺製劑「女用生殖素」，為調經强身唯，一聖劑，連服一月，其生殖腺即旺盛充實，而乳峰臀部即臻於完美發育，凡欲求得眞正健美之女界同胞，曷不于「女用生殖素」中求之？</p>

<h3>白濁當夫婦同時根治否則隨時可輾轉相傳</h3>
<p>花柳惡症，白濁最為頑固，如失去急性期易治之機會，即轉入慢性時期，痛苦雖緩，而毒實深竄，患者每易誤為已經治愈，然夫妻同室，自難各不相犯，故每于此時復傳染于妻室，成為淋濁性白帶，自此交相傳染，病毒愈深，釜底抽薪，斬草除根，非發婦同時並服淋濁特效藥「安敵淋」以一網打盡不可。</p>
<p>例如有本地人陶君夫婦者，年均卅三四，陶君於廿六歲時誤交不潔，染來淋病，初起急性時期，其勢凶惡，雜藥亂投，將毒收入內部，化為慢性，痛苦較緩，以為已吿治愈，即于此時傳染于陶夫人，白帶淋漓，不敢吿述，而陶君未知也，後陶翁以酒後復發，始由共同鄕至友魯君介紹內服「安敵淋」治愈？（因魯君前亦曾患淋病，服「安敵淋」根治後，重未再發，）陶君自覺藥力與前此所服各藥不同，身體生機，均感舒適愉快，為前此所未有，但自與其夫人同房後，立即又發，始大怪異，春初，來余處中述前情，並求診治，余旣詰悉本末，知其祟在陶夫人之未同時受治，即囑同時並服「安敵淋」，而陶夫人更囑外用「療帶靈」以去炎凈　，一個月後，夫婦均吿根治，迄今半載左右，未有再發云。</p>

<p>患者雷君，廣西人，年二十七歲，學界，雷君在成童時期，因遭劣友所誘，致犯手淫甚劇，訂婚前始自戒絕，然已現遺精之苦，誤於治療，以致生機促弱，結婚後深覺早洩之苦，生趣毫無，新婦怨懟，坐是感情淡薄，漸致破裂，今春診，余診得其精管鬆弛，性能促弱，非固補並重不可，即囑向五洲藥房購服「希米脫氏固精片」固其精關，遣精即止，並服「生殖素」以壯健生殖腺，中氣頓足，同時並輔以電療，故為期藉口月許，即吿痊愈，最近接其來函稱謝，云自別後所患從未再發，夫婦感情，勝於新婚，且其夫人巳懷孚三個月云。</p>
<p>（二）腎痿以致離婚</p>
<p>患者孫君，四川人，年三十四歲，業商，孫君因少犯手淫，過于劇烈，生機為之斵喪，性能形成頹廢，腎痿早洩，夫職難盡，妻室怨懟，已非朝夕，日久詬誶時起，感情趨于破裂，涉訟公堂，判准離異，孫君自遭此重大之刺　，嗒焉若喪，遂决心求治，經囑向太和藥房購服性病名藥「生殖素」，並兼施電療後，性能頓復，生機重萌，早洩腎痿，沉疴皆霍然而除，孫君事後追憶前塵，自悔不早求治療，致抱此終天之恨云。</p>

<p>戒者李君，現寓熱河路，年四十七歲，職業未明，前月來診，據訴染癮多年，三次求戒，均以遺精失眠等不安症狀湧現，精神委頓，體力難受，　復吸上，余當囑向太和藥房購服「希米脫氏固精片」治其遣精失眠之苦，投服培補戒煙名劑「生殖素」除毒斷癮，培補虧損，同時並注射「育維賜保命」輔弼之，以達縮短戒期之效，故為期四名左右，即安全戒烟，迅復壯健，見烟自厭矣。</p>

<h3>健忘頭眩失眠多夢療養方法</h3>
<p>— 俞伯符醫師</p>
<p>都市之靑年，最易罹之關病，其惟神經衰弱乎，蓋人事日繁，刺　孔多，市聲喧擾，殆無寧晷，於是腦神經首當其衝，健忘，頭眩，失眠，多夢，遂成為習見之通病，易地療養，旣為事實上所不放地，用藥自療，又苦一時無所適從，則指示領導，為醫師應盡之天職，爰作本文以供借鑑。</p>
<p>腦神經衰弱，為神經衰弱中重症之一，大都多由性神經衰弱感　而起，故患者常兼訴有遺精，早洩等症，就我人生理言之，精液有昇華榮養腦髓之功，故如罹有遺精症者，非速服「希米脫氏固精片」治之不可，而補精補腦，則須服生殖腺製劑「生殖素」，始克奏挽衰起弱，培補虧損之功。</p>
<p>腦弱患者除藥療而外，同時行使下列療養法，則就治更速，一，戒絕煙酒及一切有刺　性之飮食，（如濃　咖啡，辛辣等，）二·早起早睡，勵行運動，三·勿過勞，四·節慾，五·食物須擇滋養料豐富者，六·常沐浴，出遊。</p>
<p>四肢麻木</p>
<p>患者金君，四肢常麻木，迭次求治，均無大效，後由德醫介紹服「强斯登氏骨痛片」，袪其風濕，除其血毒，即吿根治，四肢靈活異常云。</p>
<p>滑精求治</p>
<p>奔牛沈雪影君：尊罹滑精，勢殊危殆，可速並服「希米脫氏固精片」及「生殖素」以救治之，連服一月，切勿間斷。</p>
<p>未老先衰</p>
<p>馬君：尊恙當服「生殖素」以回複壯盛，則氣血自旺，肌肉亦自發達也。至於胃弱可服「健胃藥」治之。</p>
<p>白帶隱病</p>
<p>城內也是園弄某女士：令妹當外用「療帶靈」以淨膣去炎，如同時並服「女用生殖素」尤有治病健宮，調經駐春之功。</p>
<p>骨痛常識</p>
<h3>骨痛中風　前因後果</h3>
<p>— 香港醫科大學醫學學士吳大超</p>
<p>一般人之見解，以為骨痛與中風，截然為風牛馬不相及之二症，按諸醫理，殊未盡然，蓋骨痛與中風，實有因果相乘之連帶關係，其病源實聘轍，換言之，骨痛特中風之前驅，而中風乃骨痛之結果耳，</p>
<p>試先言骨痛之起因，有緣於飽受風寒潮濕而起者，有緣於餘毒蘊積而起者，患者排泄失常，血份不潔，尿强酸過多，此項酸毒，表成結晶，有如碎玻璃屑，入骨骱間，即鎈軋而現痛感，此骨痛之由來也，血液中尿强酸旣過多，於是血管壁膜受其影響，形成硬化，易致爆裂，此中風之由來也，</p>
<p>是故骨痛治法，首在除其尿酸，中風治法，亦以此為最要，尿酸旣肅淸，則骨節舒暢而骨痛之苦自去，血管自復原，中風之危解而爆裂之禍可免，名藥「强斯登氏骨痛片」之所以被奉為治療骨痛之聖劑，防救中風之神藥者，固首在乎其解酸力之强，然其淸血去毒，袪風除濕之功效，有足多者，故對於肌痠，筋痙，腋麻，體癱等變症，亦能獨奏其尅期治療這神效也。</p>
<p>患者孫君，年四十三歲，因在少年時代飽受風濕，故至卅五歲起即罹骨痛，初則肌痠筋痙，繼則肢麻體癱，痛苦難堪，自由喪失，身體衰弱，面容蒼老，今春來診，囑向五洲藥房購服「强斯登氏骨痛片」袪風凈毒，并服「生殖素」挽衰起弱後，骨痛霍然自療，身體頓復壯健，虎虎有力，前後判若兩人云。</p>
<p>靑年救星</p>
<h3>兩性間熱情的上昇</h3>
<p>— 任國祥醫師</p>
<p>貢獻給婚前婚後的靑年</p>
<p>一段人生的過程中，有不少苦樂不同的滋味在分配給人，造物是公平的，為了呌人類得到樂的調劑，所以有男女兩性的相互生存。在這相互生存的神秘生活中，兩性間就有無可形容的快活在演奏了。</p>
<p>做丈夫的應該要站在做丈夫的地位上發揮男性固有的能力，來饜足妻子的慾望，導妻子到深深頂巔快樂之境，這樣纔能够產生和好的家庭，來充分領略健全性生活的樂趣。不過，話又要說回來了，沒有健全體格的人，自然不能行使健全的性生活，如男子罹有遺精，早洩，滑精，陰萎的，然雖有地屠門而大嚼的雄心，但是結果，熱情的節奏，為了身體上弱點的暴露，大有一顆雄心，冰消瓦解，非但自身感到苦惱，而且陷妻子於嘆息搖頭這境，久之久之，希望永成夢想，不是實行婚變，就是要向你明修棧道了。</p>
<p>這種危險性的潛伏，實在不是家庭間的幸福，確屬是男女間的鴻溝。靑年們！夫婦間的快樂，是天賦所予的，應該細細地去探求，為了要達到目的，不可不未雨綢繆，請不要在岐途傍徨了！也不必慨嘆怨恨，要曉得：「臨淵而羨魚，不若退而結網。」在這裏貢獻給你一種常識，你一向有遣精的，服「希米脫氏固精片」以挽救之，使你的精液貯貯存，體力壯健。早洩，陰萎的，除了趕快滋補生殖腺之外，實在無路可循。此時應以眞正純良的生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』服之，不但可使身體强壯，肌肉結實，而且效命疆塲，有進無退了。</p>

<p>是否淋病三則：其一</p>
<p>春風一度</p>
<p>第八號，本市孫錫庚君問：敝人前偕二三友人冶遊，與某妓春風一度之後，翌日自覺小便刺痛。當時驚駭異常，即請醫求治。醫謂是否淋病現尙不知，須待數日之後。並代注射黃色素一針，云可防預。敝人回家後度日如年，茶飯懶進—自思如染此病，則後半生幸福將付流水。當時恨該妓入骨髓。至今巳半月餘，小便仍舊刺痛，但無其他異常。故請問：（一）是否淋病？（二）如非淋病是何病，如何療？（三）「黃色素」能防淋病否？（四）淋病如何症狀？（五）近來精神萎靡，食慾不進，於吾病有無關係？</p>
<p>（一）淋病潛伏期一日至四日，最多八日，今已半月餘，非淋病。（二）恐是尿道輕微挫傷，重者須用外科方法請醫療治，輕者自服「唹華葉素」（Ucarsol）即可。（三）未嘗不可，但無絕對效力。（四）潛伏期過後人身倦怠，發熱，小便熱刺痛。有白色膿汁流出，尿急而短等。（五）無關患病，此為精神感動使然。其二，</p>
<p>白帶夥多</p>
<p>第九號，屠振亞君問：敝人未結婚時和冶遊，但未曾患病，自與賤內結褵，未滿半月，賤內忽發勢，白帶頗多，（一）不知是否女人淋病？（二）敝人冶遊而未患病，不知亦能傳染賤內否？（三）如何療治？</p>
<p>（一）臨床上診斷女人淋病，常以白帶之多否為斷，如此則尊嫂大有淋病可欵。但欲確診，則非將白帶送交醫師處檢查不可。（二）諱病忌醫，非現代人所應有，閣下曾否患本病不可瞞醫。人而能為自濁「帶菌者」，素無此說，須待實騐後答覆。（四）內服「果能尅淋片」（Sino-acriuqin　Tab）注射「百淋病」（Poligon），並用『含銀果能尅淋』洗子宮（Argoacrindin）。其三，</p>
<p>慢性淋病</p>
<p>第十號X君問：我去年生過一次淋病，自巳買『海濁尅星』，喫了一個月纔好，可是沒有斷根了多辛苦了一點，或喫些酒，依舊有濁流出來。先生，你看這有什麽法子治得牠除根？</p>
<p>答：你是『慢性淋病』，什麽斷根不斷根，簡單一句話，你還沒有治好。論起治療來，在急性的時候便當，慢性的要治好非下絕大的决心不可，在這個時期裏打針，服藥，都歸無用，祇要天天用『含銀果能尅淋』冲洗兩次就够。大槪須要很多時間，非兩個月是難望全治的罷！自己冲洗還不妥當，用過過大有弄巧成拙，釀成『睪丸炎』，『攝護腺炎』（當然也要看細菌是那一型。二十七型『白濁雙球菌』只有數型能成『睪丸炎』，『攝護腺炎』）的危險，為謹愼起見，請醫冲洗最妥。</p>
<p>滿頭熱癤</p>
<p>第十一號，張福全君問：小女生下未及一歲，頭上生　，滿頭都是。肩上，臀上，背上，腹上也有幾顆。本想破頭後可以全愈，誰知越生越多，請問（一）是否胎毒？（二）如何可以不再生出？答：（一）無此說。（二）用『三福消腫膏』（Sanfloid）熱敷，並注射『拿佛哥』（Novargol），後者用量請醫師斟酬。</p>
<p>痢已多時</p>
<p>第十二號，趙福生君問，家母年逾　不惑，體質素不佳，常常咳嗽。最近一個月來一天出三四回恭，肚子不痛，買『阿達斯』內服，喫了即止，止了再瀉，請問（一）是否『稀屎癆』，（二）能治好否，用什麽藥治？（三）這病怎麽來的？</p>
<p>（一）是『腸結核』，又名『結核性腸潰瘍』，閣下說是『稀屎癆』，尙講得通。（二）可服『阿收單寗』（Acetanin），但難治愈。（三）是和肺癆患者同桌飮食，或嚥下自己的痰而來的，如果令堂也有肺結核的話。脚氣二則：其一，</p>
<p>兩脚無力</p>
<p>第十三號，王達三君問：我最近常常心跳，兩脚無力，坐不久發麻（一）有人說是脚氣，可是我脚不腫？（二）上海此病也常見否？（三）什麽緣故？（四）怎麽治？</p>
<p>答：（一）是脚氣。脚氣有好機種！如『冲心性脚氣』，『麻痺性脚氣』，『水腫性脚氣』，『初期脚氣』是，所以並不一定脚腫。尊病恐是麻痺性脚氣。（二）以余所知，上海病極多，尤其是勞工，實前途一大問題也。（三）缺乏『維他命Ｂ4』同時有細菌感染。（四）內服『維他命B』（Vitamin-B），注射『士的寗』（Strychnin　Nitrata），禁米，多菜疏和果品，及饅頭，麵包。其二，</p>
<p>兩脚腫脹</p>
<p>第十四號，高占棲君問：賤內今年生產，尙在授乳期內，兩脚漸漸腫脹。食不進。便秘，欵是脚氣。請問（一）是否脚氣？（二）如何治？（三）食不進，便秘與脚氣有關否？（四）回鄕可治愈否？（五）敝友曾患脚氣，謂脚氣沒有腱反射，何謂腱反射？</p>
<p>（一）未診查雖不敢謂必，但綜合觀之頗似脚氣。（二）見第十三號第四條。便秘可服『療塞通』（Laxadon），食慾不進可服『阿賽多斯陪潑辛』（Actose-Pepsine）（三）亦脚氣之一症狀。（四）遷地療法於本病最有效。（五）人正坐於床沿，兩下腿垂下，輕敲膝蓋骨下端，略一遲欵，腿向前踢，脚向上剔的是『正常』『膝蓋反應』；敲後略不遲欵，卽向前踢，脚也不向前踢的呌做『亢進』，是初期脚氣症狀；敲後動作不敏捷的呌做『减退』，是脚氣後期的症候；敲後完全不動的呌做『消失』，也是脚氣後期的症候。但這非有經騐不能查得準確。</p>
<p>便下脂肪</p>
<p>第十五號，程彝君問：小女今年六歲，平日常呼腹痛，便下半凝固的蛋白狀的脂肪條，請問（一）是何病？（二）何藥醫？</p>
<p>答：（一）『粘液疝通』。（二）可常服Vitamin-A（『維他命A』）Vitamin-B（『維他命B』）等補藥</p>
<p>睪丸腫大</p>
<p>第十六號，歐陽亞光君問：我是一個勞工。自幼有睪丸腫大病，裏面好像一股子氣，常常動來動去，用力一壓就回去。我因為工作非常不便。想治好他，先生請介紹一個省錢的地方去治。因為不瞞先生，一個月拿幾塊錢喫飯就生問題，病生在身上眞治不起呀！</p>
<p>答：你好像是『外鼠蹊疝氣』，這病正如扁鵲所說：『針炙所不能及，酒醪所不能達』，根治方法只有開刀。我想上海若許醫院，一定不乏慈善醫師為你免費治療，介紹醫生實在有關醫者道德，不能為力。</p>
<p>時常傷風</p>
<p>第十七號，李君達君問：敝人年幼衰弱，時常傷風。傷風雖小事，深恐常常發熱，咳嗽，弄成肺病。所以（一）請急想個法子，使他不再傷風。（二）實在不能預防就請指示傷風的療法，以便生了病速好。</p>
<p>（答）：（一）君是否有『慢性鼻竇炎』或『扁桃腺炎』不得而知，知有，割治後則不至再常傷風。此外可注射『流行生性感冒苗漿』，但效力不可靠。煆煉身體。增加身體的抵抗力最重要。（二）鼻塞用『二號加非得林』（Caphedrin　No2）塞鼻；咳嗽服『咳利舒開』（Kresocal）；頭痛發熱服『痛必靈』（Tonbelin）。</p>
<p>下腿濕爛</p>
<p>第十八號，劉和尙君問：敝人去冬下腿四臭虫咬搔破，以後破口日益大開，現在有三寸大，不痛不癢，肉色發黑。醫生看得不少，藥也用了不少，始終未曾見效，請問有何方法可治。</p>
<p>答：是『慢性潰瘍』，治好本是難事，但以余之經騐，藥物只有一種，名『皮治藥軟膏』（Pixrol）治療本病有效，但須持之以恒，非　日至數星期，難望治愈。</p>
<p>想戒香煙</p>
<p>第十九號，謝利恒君問，敝人嗜香煙巳多年，近來時常頭暈，恐是中毒，故擬戒除。而日手指焦黃，惡味，非常厭人。巳戒數次，戒而復吸，奪無良法可以完全戒絕，請示辦法。</p>
<p>答：『賀爾賜保命』可為戒煙酒之輔助劑（Hormspermin）</p>
<p>請戒老海</p>
<p>（一）貴診所可戒老海否？（二）藥費若干？（三）可否走戒，有無痛苦？（四）開『補斯命』可以戒鴉片，不知老海亦能戒否？價若干？（第二十號，Y．S．君問）</p>
<p>（一）可。（二）自五元至五十元，禮龐量而定，注射費另計。（三）可，無大痛苦，堂堂男子，為解除將來之大痛苦，何必畏畏縮縮，畏懼目前之小痛苦，（四）能，價目逕詢藥房可也。</p>
<p>包皮過長</p>
<p>第二十一號，趙小林君問：（一）包皮過第有何害處？（二）手術費幾何？（三）先生處可割否，有無痛苦，幾日可愈？（四）先生門診時刻。</p>
<p>（一）藏垢納垢，平時易起包皮炎，包皮水腫，龜頭炎；婚後不生育；易生花柳病。（二）各醫師不同，本醫師五元。（三）可；無大痛苦；五日至一星期。（五）上午八至十二，下午三至六。</p>

<h3>北海事件</h3>
<p>— 我</p>
<p>成都事件，日本駐華大使川越氏，現方奉外務省的訓令，準備商談，不料北海事件，又突然而起，此種不幸事件，連續發生，眞是對於兩國親善關係上得到重大的打擊，殊為遺憾。</p>
<p>成都事件，怎樣起因，怎樣發生這樣嚴重的結果，一時未得較詳的報吿，無從加以具體的論斷，惟以意度之，約有數點：（一）一般亂民，搗亂地方秩序，而日本新聞記者，適逢其會，偶遭不幸，並無仇殺之意者也，（二）一般亂民，因中日嚴重的局勢，藉洩一時的悶氣，或借此造成交涉難解决之局面，使政府不易應付，惟此種事件，發生於成都省城，在地方當局，自不能不負其責，然亦僅係地方事件，而於國交上大體無關，决不能因小題而大做也。</p>
<p>至於北海事件，更為不幸，現在廣東雖巳大定，而桂省局部問題，正在進行協商中，頗有和平解决之好轉，而一般崛强不馴之軍隊，李白招之卽來，一時未能揮之使去，此種軍隊，尙逗留於北海一帶，此時非特中央的命令，未肯接受，卽李白的命令，恐亦有所不行，此種軍隊，　集一隅，見無出路希望，乃惟恐地方之無事，而日望其有事者，不惜造成此種兇案，而使中央棘手，在此種狀態之下，中央旣無法保全外僑，亦惟有望外僑之善於自謀而已，故此種責任，在我國當局所不敢辭，然亦不能完全負其責也。</p>
<p>總之現當兩國交涉嚴重之狀態中，亦在兩國交涉正在好轉中，外僑自應審愼周慮，在此種並未穩定的區城，應當稍加規選，以免引起事端，因政府保護外僑，原是責職所在，無如在地方混亂的情形中，雖有保護的熱誠，但形格勢禁，一時難以周到，此亦事勢所莫可奈何者也。</p>
<p>幷且此種事件，發生於某一地方，不是莠民乘機搗亂，便是無紀律，與未受中央統治的軍人，假此為反對中央的工具，故此種事件，完全係地方性質，决不能題發揮，擴大其事，而與整個交併為一談也，故欲調整中日兩國邦交，原在此種問題以外，而並不在此種問題之中，若以此種事件，併為一談，則困難問題，當在其後矣。</p>
<h3>一條褲子</h3>
<p>— 梅平</p>
<p>皓月富空，夜凉如火，響晚又下過一陣細雨，宇宙彷彿冲洗過了沒有一絲灰塵，獨坐在窗前，聽着院子里啁啾的蟲聲，一個夏天所給於我的厭倦，現在像一個畏途跋涉的流浪者覓得了溫暖的放店，愉快的休息呵。</p>
<p>在這樣輕悄之夜，本來應該早一點入睡，彌補幾個月來的失眠，但是鐘　已響了一下，等候着情人那樣地我還千元坐在窗前。桌上安放着一册我所喜歡讀的書，現在被輕微的秋風翻到了最末一頁，那是一輻時裝店的廣吿，畫着穿了皮領大衣的紳士小姐們都從那家店里走出來。—是的，已經是秋天了，緊跟着的就是個嚴寒的冬天。</p>
<p>於是我感到一陣凉意侵蝕看我的四肢，急忙穿了浴衣，閉上窗，睡到床上鼻腔已微微窒息着了。秋天生病本也是幸福的，不過那幅時裝店的廣吿深印在我的腦神經上，現在還穿着一套破舊的白凡布西裝的朋友，似乎沒有生幸福底小病的資格。</p>
<p>我開始注意到靜靜地躺在角落里的二品衣箱，像一個小偷那樣地謹愼，那是我唯一的二口衣箱呵。它們是我的侶伴，從刮着黃沙的北國到溫和南方，它們沒有一秒鐘的時間離開過我，那上面的各式各樣的行李票，像我額上的皺紋一樣，已經不能估計它們正確的年齡了。</p>
<p>那二口衣箱里倒底藏着些什麽呢？做主人的我都有些模糊了，因為到這里住下來以後，我沒有更換過身上的那套衣服。這還在其次，當我想從它們身上給我一點希望的時侯，幾乎連擱置鑰匙的地方都記憶不起來了。</p>
<p>箱子上面積着很厚的灰塵，我用乾布拭着，稍微用一點力，就發出一陣哎吱的聲音，也們怨恨我這主人太不注意它們的康健嗎？下雨的時候，屋漏從墻壁上蜿蜓下來積在緒子的底層；這屋子里僅有的一面窓，又開得那末遠，它們見不到一些陽，祇讓灰塵和蜘蛛網做着家。</p>
<p>箱子是開了，一股霉汚味直冲我的鼻孔，在低弱的燈光下，我眼睛發花了，我看不見什麽，我疑惑那口箱子是空的。於是一個盲子那樣地用手去掏摸，我摸着了幾樣滑膩的東西，現在我看得很淸楚了，是破碎的襪子，發臭了的汗衫，一直摸到箱子見底，才發現了寶藏，一條常靑西褲對疊着躺在那裏，雖然觸覺告訴我也像泥鰍那樣油滑，而且上面開着許多白色的花朵，但是我的欣喜已是莫可名狀了。是狄天了呵，應該穿上秋衣了。</p>
<p>然而馬上又使我失望了，上身呢，馬夾呢？那套衣服是在一個小市城裏做的，式樣自然不大漂亮，價格比大都市裏便宜二分之一呢。現在如果單去配製一件上身，恐怕也要這些錢吧？於是我開第二口箱子，因為我的搬家太忙，常常在要走之前把東西在兩口箱子裏亂堆亂塞的。第二口箱子又開了，隨了我手摸出來的是破碎的襪子，發臭了的汗衫，一直見底，沒有什麽了。</p>
<p>我再躺到床上，想着我上次搬家的情形。上次搬家在我大病之後，醫藥費的支出把我所有値錢的東西都寄在長生庫裏了，而那套西服因為一時尋不到那條褲子，祇把上身和馬夾繼了錢，那末，我還要尋什麽呢？</p>
<p>秋天的月色是太好了，它從那小窗裏射到我睡着的床上使我本能安睡，但是我已沒有賞月的興趣了，反之我覺得它很使人討厭。</p>
<p>鼻腔還是室息着，明天恐怕要生病了。</p>

<h3>Yu Hanmou Speaks on the New Life Movement</h3>
<p>(Guangzhou) Commander-in-Chief Yu Hanmou gave a radio address at the Guangzhou Municipal Government on the 11th, titled "Strive to Implement the New Life Movement." His original speech was as follows: "We all know that the New Life Movement promotes a disciplined life based on propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame. What are propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame? Chairman Chiang has already given a very clear explanation, which is that 'propriety is a proper and respectful attitude, righteousness is proper and upright behavior, integrity is clear and honest discernment, and a sense of shame is a real and concrete awareness.' These rules are the rules that should be observed in dealing with people and affairs, and in conducting oneself and interacting with others. There is absolutely no room for doubt. Conversely, if we do not follow these rules, what will the result be? Undoubtedly, it will lead to national subjugation and racial extinction. Because the explanation of propriety is reason, it is called law in nature, rules in society, and discipline in the state. In this way, if there is no propriety, the rules of society and the discipline of the state will be destroyed. Can a country without discipline exist independently? Furthermore, from the perspective of righteousness, the ancients said, 'Righteousness is appropriateness,' which means proper behavior, that is, being in accordance with the way of heaven, the rules of society, and the discipline of the state. If there is no righteousness in society, a trend of killing, framing, and infighting will naturally occur. A nation that has this trend and cannot eradicate it will certainly not prosper. Furthermore, from the perspective of integrity, integrity means clarity, that is, being able to distinguish between right and wrong. The ancients said, 'When the world is in chaos, right and wrong are first confused; when the world is settled, right and wrong are first determined.' It can be seen that the two words right and wrong must be clearly distinguished in society in order to cultivate oneself, manage one's family, govern the state, and bring peace to the world. If right and wrong are not clear, that is, good and evil are not distinguished, society will certainly have no good order, and the country will certainly not be strong enough. Finally, let's talk about the word shame. Shame means knowledge, that is, having a sense of shame and aversion, that is, knowing that one's behavior does not uphold propriety, righteousness, and integrity, and being ashamed of oneself, and then correcting it. Knowing that one's moral, intellectual, and physical education is inferior to others, being ashamed of oneself, and then striving to improve oneself. These can all be examples of knowing shame. The ancients said, 'Knowing shame is close to courage.' If one does not know shame, the people will certainly be immersed in decadence, without a doubt. Therefore, Guanzi said, 'Propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame are the four cardinal virtues of a country; if the four cardinal virtues are not upheld, the country will perish.' These words are absolutely correct. The words I have said above are all based on Chairman Chiang's outline of the New Life Movement, but we should know that although propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame each have their own meanings, their nature is interlinked and inseparable. We should sincerely accept them all and work hard to implement them calmly, following the above four guidelines of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame, and following Chairman Chiang's analysis of the four guidelines, to "maintain order," "value diligence and thrift," "be simple," "be unadorned," "be clean," "be neat," "be honest," and "be loyal," starting with our own clothing, food, housing, and transportation. This is the right thing to do. In recent years, there are many unsatisfactory aspects in Guangdong's politics and society, but I can say that these unsatisfactory things are due to the fact that the New Life Movement has not been paid attention to and earnestly implemented. If we want to make Guangdong a model province, we must strive to implement the New Life Movement. Our Guangdong has the earliest contact with foreigners, the earliest contact with Eastern and Western cultures, and is also the hometown of President Sun. The revolutionary ideas of the people are also very common. The National Revolution also started from Guangdong. It can be seen that the thoughts of the people in Guangdong will not be behind other provinces. Moreover, the New Life Movement has been effective in other provinces, and it is naturally easier for us to implement it in Guangdong. I will give an example to prove that what I said is correct. Guangdong's gambling tax has a total revenue of more than 13 million every year. Many of the government's expenses rely on this gambling tax to maintain. Therefore, many people criticize that Guangdong's ban on gambling will not be successful. But we know that the recent Guangdong Provincial Government has resolutely banned it. This incident is enough to show the spirit of Guangdong people who know shame and have courage. I said above that the guidelines of the New Life Movement, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame, are interlinked and inseparable. If we can know shame, we can naturally implement the three guidelines of propriety, righteousness, and integrity. Therefore, we should restore our self-confidence and believe that we have the ability to implement it, and accept and strive to implement the New Life Movement promoted by Chairman Chiang with a twelve-point sincere attitude. Finally, I will summarize today's speech into the following sentences, please pay attention: (1) The New Life Movement is a movement to save the country and strengthen the nation. (2) We should accept and implement this movement in its entirety with a twelve-point sincere attitude. (3) We should restore our self-confidence and believe that we have the ability to implement it, and resolve to implement this New Life Movement and revitalize China.

<h3>Japanese Regular Cabinet Meeting: Arita Reports on the Beihai Incident; Many Japanese Right-Wing Organizations Express Indignation; Newspaper Opinion and Public Atmosphere Have Become More Moderate</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese regular cabinet meeting was held at 2 p.m. today. The main topic of discussion was the case of the murder of Japanese resident Nakano Junzo in Beihai. First, Foreign Minister Arita gave a detailed explanation of the local report, and then the discussion began, focusing on the resolution of the meeting of the three ministries of Isoya, Toyota, and Kuwashima. Each minister attached great importance to this incident. After careful deliberation, a concrete response plan has been decided. A new instruction will be issued to Ambassador Kawagoe within days to handle the Chengdu incident together with this case, and to make a serious representation to the Nanjing government. (China United Press Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is reported that Japanese Ambassador to China Kawagoe, Army Attaché to the Chinese Embassy Kita, and Navy Attaché Sato will soon depart for Beijing. It is expected that they will visit Foreign Minister Zhang on the 10th to formally begin negotiations. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman stated this morning that Ambassador Kawagoe will soon go to Beijing, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet received the departure date of Ambassador Kawagoe from Shanghai, and the issue of deciding whether the Chengdu incident should be negotiated at the same time as the Beihai incident has been left to Ambassador Kawagoe's discretion. The spokesman also said that representatives of various right-wing organizations visited Japanese Prime Minister Hirota and Foreign Minister Arita on Wednesday, expressing strong indignation over the Chengdu and Beihai incidents, and questioned the authorities as to why they did not occupy Hainan Island to protect the safety of Japanese residents there. Today, the opinion of the various newspapers here is more moderate, and the general opinion is that the Chinese government should closely guard against the recurrence of similar incidents. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today's regular cabinet meeting opened at 2:20 p.m. Foreign Minister Arita first gave a detailed report on the information received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the Beihai incident. Subsequently, Minister of Finance Baba reported that the Emperor's visit to the new Diet building upon its completion had been decided for November 5th. After it was presented for imperial viewing, the meeting adjourned at 3:40 p.m. (Domei News Agency Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The government originally planned to hold a three-minister meeting between Foreign Minister Arita, Army Minister Terauchi, and Navy Minister Nagano after the regular cabinet meeting on the 11th to discuss the China issue centered on the Chengdu and Beihai incidents, and others. However, because Foreign Minister Arita gave a detailed report on the China issue at the cabinet meeting that day, and Japan's basic policy has also been decided, the three-minister meeting will be held after waiting for a detailed report from that place. Therefore, today's three-minister meeting has been canceled. (Domei News Agency Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the investigation of the Beihai incident, special commissioners Diao Zuoqian of Guangdong and Guangxi continued to report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by telegram on the 11th, but the detailed situation is still under investigation. Navy Attaché Nakahara of the Japanese Embassy visited Gao Zongwu, Director of the Asian Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at 3 p.m. on the 11th to inquire about the Beihai incident. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Matsumura, Secretary of the Japanese Embassy, visited personnel of the Asian Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 10 a.m. on the 11th to inquire about the report on the Beihai incident received by our side. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) Due to the serious situation in South China, the 13th Destroyer Division, Wakazake and Sanae, which hurriedly sailed south from Shanghai, arrived in Hong Kong at 1:40 p.m. on the 11th. After loading water and provisions, Wakazake is scheduled to leave Hong Kong for Beihai at 6 p.m. tonight. Sanae will replace Saga in Guangzhou to take charge of security.

<h3>Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Policy Still Emphasizes Delicacy and Moderation</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, according to well-informed Japanese sources here, although the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' policy on the Chengdu and Beihai incidents has been pressured by the Japanese Army and Navy to take strong action, it still emphasizes delicacy and moderation. As to whether this policy will be retained, it depends on how Nanjing responds to Japan's request to resolve the above two cases. If Nanjing can satisfy the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Chengdu and Beihai incidents may be concluded here. (Reuters Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Warship Sails to Beihai; Diao Zuoqian's Statement</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Guangzhou News: Regarding the case of the Japanese merchant Nakano in Beihai, the Japanese insisted on sending special commissioners on a Japanese warship to investigate. Diao Zuoqian, the special commissioner of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs stationed in Guangdong and Guangxi, made it clear that the situation in Beihai is special, and the central government's forces are currently unable to reach it, making it difficult to protect it. He has repeatedly written to the acting consul-general in Guangzhou, politely persuading him to stop. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Mr. Diao Zuoqian, the diplomatic commissioner of Guangdong and Guangxi, told a visiting Reuters reporter today that he is currently awaiting the investigation report from his country regarding the murder of Mr. Nakano, the only Japanese resident in Beihai on September 3. According to Mr. Diao, this case is only a local incident, so there will be no difficulty in resolving it. At the same time, the Chinese here are worried about the Japanese sending ships to Beihai, and because of the anti-Japanese attitude of the 19th Route Army, they are afraid that disputes may develop.

<h3>Executive Yuan Issues Order to All Provinces and Cities to Maintain Local Order and Protect Foreign Nationals</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) In view of the current situation, it is necessary for the whole country to maintain calm and avoid incidents. It is reported that the Executive Yuan issued an order to the chairmen and mayors of all provinces and cities on the 10th, stating that the National Government has reiterated its clear orders to ensure the effective protection of foreign nationals residing in China. This is a responsibility that local governments must fulfill. All diplomatic cases are being properly handled by the central government. Local disturbances should not be allowed to shake the overall situation. On the eve of the September 18th anniversary, it is feared that ignorant people may intentionally cause trouble. Therefore, it is reiterated that attention should be paid to maintaining local order and protecting foreign nationals. Efforts should also be made to prevent and eliminate potential troubles. This is of utmost importance. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Embassy Attaché Imai Issues Statement</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese Embassy Attaché Imai stated that the Japanese government and military are very concerned about the Chengdu and Beihai incidents. It is difficult to predict whether Wang Kemin will come to Beiping to take office. Wang held talks with military personnel in Dalian and Tianjin, but the content is unknown. There has been no progress in the economic cooperation between China and Japan in North China recently. However, this decision, Wanping and Fangshan, have suffered from drought. It is really necessary to improve the water conservancy projects in North China. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Jianchuan, Japanese Advisor to the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, Will Arrive in China Soon</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Lieutenant General Jianchuan, the newly hired top Japanese advisor to the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, is scheduled to come to China from Japan on the 14th to take up his new position. Jianchuan is a central figure in the Japanese military. He was dismissed from his position as the commander of the Fourth Division after the major army changes in June. All parties are paying close attention to this. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Regulations of the Hebei-Chahar Inspection Office Under Study</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) News from the Hebei-Chahar General Inspection Office: The investigation of smuggled goods has been completed and inspection fees will be charged starting next week. The tax rate will vary depending on the type of goods, and will be 40% to 45% of the regular customs duty. The regulations are still being studied by Guo Zhihan, Director of the Hebei-Chahar Finance Office in Ping. They will be announced in the coming days. The Ministry of Finance sent a telegram to Song Zheyuan inquiring about this matter in detail, believing that this method could be implemented for a limited period of time, and cancelled when the smuggled goods are sold out. Song is preparing to reply. Yuan Chongti, Deputy Director of the Hebei-Chahar General Inspection Office, visited Japanese military advisor Ikeda and Sentian on the 11th to discuss the investigation of smuggled goods. The Japanese military will assist. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the establishment of a General Inspection Office in Ping by the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, Finance Minister Kong sent a winter telegram to Song Zheyuan, requesting him to immediately order a stop to the collection of new taxes, stating that it was outrageous that Hebei-Chahar would impose new taxes. If such action is taken, please order it to be stopped immediately to avoid undermining the integrity of customs duties, etc. On the 5th, he received a reply telegram from Song Zheyuan, stating that in order to alleviate the commercial difficulties in Hebei-Chahar, it was planned to set up an inspection office to slightly levy consumption tax on goods that have not completed customs duties, so that they can be transported and sold, which does not conflict with customs duties. Finance Minister Kong believed that it was a good idea for Hebei-Chahar to set up an inspection office to assist customs in combating smuggling. However, if new taxes are levied, it would undermine the integrity of customs duties. In order to understand the truth, he sent Counselor Li Qingxuan and foreign consultant Bai to visit Song Zheyuan again, leaving Shanghai for Ping on the 12th. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) In order to prevent land smuggling, the Ministry of Finance set up a General Inspection Office in the city of Beijing, and inspection offices were set up at important stations along the Jinpu and Pinghan roads to investigate smuggled goods. Since its establishment, smuggling south of Jinan has been reduced, and few smuggled goods have been found. However, smuggled goods in Pingjin and other places are still rampant. Special Commissioner An Si'er, Deputy Commissioner Li Tonghua, went to Tianjin on the 9th to prepare for the establishment of a Tianjin branch first, and then establish a Beiping branch, so that smuggled goods cannot move, without the need for local governments to form another inspection office. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Ping branch of the Hebei-Chahar General Inspection Office was established, and Zhu Ruilin, the former director of the Ping Public Security Bureau, was appointed as the head of the branch. The second branch of the Tianjin Customs in the suburbs of the city decided to set up a Shengfang pier, which will start operations next week. The temporary office for inspection at Dakou has decided to start work on the 15th. Customs officials have already gone to arrange it on the 11th. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Hebei-Chahar General Inspection Office will collect inspection fees for smuggled goods, planning to classify rayon, sugar, piece goods, perfume, seafood, and vanilla into four categories: heaven, earth, yuan, and yellow, and levy taxes accordingly. The Qikou, Shijiazhuang, Zhangjiakou, and other branches will send personnel to prepare on the 12th and collect taxes at the same time as the General Office next week. Wu Hongen, Director of the General Office, visited Song at Song's residence at No. 133 British Concession at 11 a.m. on the 11th to ask for instructions. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Nagai, the Deputy Consul of the Japanese Consulate in Tianjin, went to the customs on the afternoon of the 11th to discuss the return of smuggled goods recently detained in the suburbs of Tianjin. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Beining Railway Bureau replied to the Ministry of Finance that the railway receives 70,000 yuan in freight charges every day for the transportation of rayon smuggled goods, which is a major source of income, and it is difficult to refuse transportation. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Zhang Zizhong Banquets Horinouchi</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The newly appointed Japanese Consul-General in Tianjin, Horinouchi, visited Chen Juesheng at the Beining Railway Bureau at 11 a.m. on the 11th. Zhang Zizhong went to the Consul-General's residence in the British Concession at 10 a.m. to return Horinouchi's visit. At 12 noon, he hosted a banquet in the Municipal Government Garden, with Lu Zongyu, Gao Lingwei, Qi Xieyuan, Chen Juesheng, and Ma Yanchong as guests. Tajiri took a China Airlines flight to Qingdao at 1 p.m. on the 12th and transferred to Shanghai to take office. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Chen Juesheng said that Song's visit to Tianjin has no specific mission. His meeting with Tashiro and Horinouchi is a matter of courtesy and has not been scheduled. The diplomatic situation in North China is inevitably rumored, but the actual situation has improved. Diplomatic matters are not without solutions, but depend on our proper handling. The division of authority between the military departments of Chahar, Suiyuan, Guandong, and North China has been regarded as another issue, and will not affect the overall situation in North China due to their disturbances. There are some cases recently proposed by the Japanese for negotiation, but there are also many that we have raised for negotiation, such as the clarification of the political power and economic cooperation. We are determined to achieve the goal of cooperation based on the principle of mutual benefit and not losing sovereignty or humiliating the country. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Japan is avoiding the use of positive strategies to pressure the political power in North China, and intends to promote a clearer path from the side. Undecided diplomatic issues are also handled with a strategy of alternating tension and relaxation. Chen Zhongfu may come to Tianjin next week to listen to Song's instructions and contact the Japanese. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>

<h3>British Diplomacy and Pacific Security</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>The diplomatic policies of the nations related to the Pacific are still extremely chaotic. Because national politicians are not God; they cannot say, like God, "Let there be light," and there is light. National politicians are also not like soldiers. Treaties they painstakingly conclude over years are often destroyed by soldiers in an instant. This era is one of destruction, not creation. This is true in Europe and in the Pacific. The two largest militaristic countries in Europe—Germany and Italy—have transformed from enemies at daggers drawn to bosom buddies. They will clearly sing a duet in the upcoming drama of total war. Britain's Baldwin and France's Léon Blum want to drag these two tigers out of their unconstrained wilderness and back into the old prison of Locarno. This is a foolish fantasy, a waste of effort with no results.</p>
<p>The high and low atmospheric pressure of European politics not only concerns Europe itself but also affects the politics of the Far East. We know that in Asia, there is a country that not only has a secret agreement with Germany, which is stirring up trouble in Europe, but also plays things by ear. When the atmospheric pressure of European politics is high, it temporarily suspends its activities. Once the atmospheric pressure is low, knowing that European countries are preoccupied with their own disputes and have no time to look eastward, or that some countries with a direct stake in the Far East, such as Britain, even have to rely on it for guidance on Far Eastern affairs, it chimes in with its allies in the same camp and actively launches attacks on the Asian continent. Haven't we seen this play out over the past five years?</p>
<p>From the above, we can get a general understanding that peace is indivisible. There will be no peace in the Pacific without world peace. Those who advocate limiting war to one corner while keeping themselves out of the vortex of war are either foolish or have ulterior motives. If the major powers presiding over the League of Nations, such as Britain and France, had cooperated with the United States, as the U.S. Secretary of State suggested at the time, and strictly adhered to the covenant, implementing sanctions to deter the aggressor, then the Abyssinian affair might not have happened. The authority of the League of Nations might not have been lost to this extent. The Far Eastern situation might not have deteriorated to this degree. And the Washington Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact might not have become waste paper, as they are today. "A single misstep leads to complete failure." Now, national politicians want to maintain world peace by patching up the many treaties that have already been pierced by bayonets, but it is probably too late. The most obvious example is the recent Pacific Conference in Yosemite, USA, where the Japanese representative Yoshizawa publicly argued for amending the Nine-Power Treaty, citing the "necessity of expanding into China" as the reason. He also stated that including words like "sanctions" in the revised treaty would make Japan feel "uneasy." It is clear that the concept of "collective security" has not only been erased in fact but even the idea itself has been rejected by countries that use military occupation as a means of territorial expansion. In such circumstances, how can there be peace in the world?</p>
<p>Since the concept of "collective security" has faded due to the arrogance of the aggressor nations and the loss of prestige of the League of Nations, the open diplomacy stipulated in the League of Nations covenant, which requires "all international treaties to be notified to the League of Nations and published by the League of Nations," will inevitably disappear due to the incompetence of the League of Nations. The prevalence of secret diplomacy, as in the old days, is naturally unavoidable today.</p>
<p>Britain, which has the power to influence world politics, has been under the control of the Conservative Party in recent years. In Europe, it initially called for collective security, but ultimately revealed its embarrassing and ugly true face in the Italian-Abyssinian affair. In the Pacific, from beginning to end, it has taken seeking practical benefits as its starting point. As the newly appointed British Ambassador to China, Archibald Clark Kerr, said in Tokyo, "Britain's interests in China are primarily economic in nature, especially trade." Therefore, we can summarize Britain's current foreign policy toward China as how to maintain its trade interests in the face of another country's ambition to swallow the whole of China. They know that in this turbulent time in Europe, they do not have the strength to compete with the emerging power in East Asia alone. Therefore, their policy is to seek compromise as long as their existing interests are not excessively damaged. According to the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun of the 2nd of last month, Ambassador Clark Kerr met with the Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Yoshida, in London and exchanged detailed opinions on Japan's political, economic, and military intentions toward China and Britain's hopes and intentions toward China. He also strongly advocated the necessity of cooperation between Britain and Japan in the Far East. Foreign Minister Eden completely agreed. Although this is one-sided propaganda from the Japanese, it is probably not far from the truth. From this, we can understand why Rose had to go through Japan first to come to China and why Rose had to go to Tokyo again before leaving China. And why did Ambassador Clark Kerr have to visit the Tokyo government first before coming to China this time? From Britain's perspective, this kind of diplomacy may allow it to preserve some of its trade interests temporarily. However, the facts of the past five years tell us that under the so-called "leapfrog" process, the boundaries of British trade have already been squeezed and confined to the Yangtze River basin. In this situation, if they still avoid the open road of peace and cling to the husk of realism, I am afraid that when the flames spread, Britain's situation in the Far East will be even more embarrassing than the Italian-Abyssinian affair.</p>
<h3>High Tide of Anti-Russian Movement at German Socialist Party Congress Rosenberg and Goebbels Painstakingly Denounce the Communist System Hitler Attempts to Create a New Alliance Wants to Oust the Soviet Union from Europe</h3>
<p>Nuremberg The National Socialist Party Congress today held a "Labor Service" festival celebration, with a solemn scene. 45,000 members of the labor union gathered in the large schoolyard, wielding shovels, beating drums, and waving flags in a goose-step, passing before the Führer Hitler. Among them were 10,000 young people, all undressed to the waist, receiving enthusiastic welcome from the audience. Hitler then addressed them, saying that labor service is no less than a higher school of training for the National Socialist Party. Now, in the countries of Marxism, cities and towns are burned, villages are shattered, classes fight each other, and brothers kill each other. We are taking another path, uniting you instead of dividing you. Then, Propaganda Minister Dr. Goebbels addressed the Congress, warning the world to rise up against Jews and Bolshevism. Goebbels stated that the survival of Europe is in imminent crisis, and now we should decide how to deal with Bolshevism, regardless of the consequences. Germany firmly believes that one day it will make the world understand the true face of Jews and Bolshevism. If Europe wants to restore its healthy state, Bolshevism must be destroyed. Goebbels also said that Bolshevism can only be produced from the brains of Jews. Today, more than 98% of the senior officials of the Soviet Russian government are Jews. In light of the fierce opposition to Jews and Bolshevism by Hitler and Goebbels in the past two days, people have speculated about whether Germany will continue to maintain its ambassador in Moscow. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>Nuremberg Tonight, at the annual Congress of the National Socialist Party, Rosenberg, the Director of the Foreign Affairs Group of the National Socialist Party, and Goebbels, the Propaganda Minister, both delivered lengthy speeches, severely criticizing the Soviet Union and Bolshevism. The foreign guests attending the Congress were deeply impressed by these speeches, believing that this clear declaration of war against Bolshevism and the Soviet Russian political system would lead to unimaginable political consequences. Rumors have spread that Germany will sever relations with the Soviet Union or break off diplomatic relations on some pretext. It is said that when the National Socialist Party Congress officially closes next Monday, Führer Hitler will deliver a speech, reiterating his anti-Bolshevik views. Some people say that Hitler will propose to European countries to unite and create a new Holy Alliance to oppose Moscow, that is, to politically exclude Soviet Russia from Europe. The surge of the anti-Soviet movement in Germany is evident here. The following are excerpts from the speeches of Rosenberg and Goebbels:</p>
<p>Rosenberg's Speech</p>
<p>First, he said, "The future survival of Europe depends on Germany as the mainstay. In the past, the Jewish capitalist Rathenau (who served as the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Construction in the Socialist Party's cabinet and was assassinated in 1922) tried to link Germany and Soviet Russia, and the National Socialist Party was the first to oppose it. Today, the outstanding elements of Spain are being subjected to a terrifying massacre, and all Europeans must not disregard their future because of this." Rosenberg continued, saying that the Bolshevik revolution was organized by the Jewish world according to a predetermined and immutable plan. "Moscow and Madrid are exactly the same." Without the leadership of Jews, there would never be a true social revolution. "We have personally witnessed the activities of Jews in Russia and Germany. Now Jews are expelling German expatriates in Madrid and Barcelona (important Spanish ports currently occupied by the government army). … In the past, the Spanish monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella expelled Jews from the country. Now Jews are destroying hundreds of Spanish churches and shedding the blood of pure Spanish stock. It can be said that Jews have avenged their ancient hatred. Not only that, but the so-called Bolshevism is actually the creed of the lower classes of society. The Bolshevik Party, in its political and military conspiracies, relies solely on the police and the army. It can no longer be destroyed. It must rely on new beliefs and actions to contain the poisonous flames of Bolshevism. Those who claim to protect Western civilization actually allow Soviet Russia to join the League of Nations. This is tantamount to selling out European culture with a straight face." Rosenberg finished his speech.</p>
<p>Goebbels' Speech</p>
<p>Then Propaganda Minister Goebbels took the stage to speak. His wording was generally the same as Rosenberg's. He briefly stated, "The Communist Party outside of Russia is no less than the foreign legion set up by the Third International in foreign countries. Therefore, countries where the Communist Party occupies a strong position are inevitably dominated by Stalin's orders. For example, there is a great power in the West that, after signing an agreement with Soviet Russia, its domestic Communist Party received instructions from Moscow and would no longer oppose the expansion of armaments or the passage of military budget bills. Its manipulation by Moscow can be seen from this. The Communist Party is now preparing to go to war against Germany and wants to drag France into the vortex of war. This is the so-called Soviet peace policy." In addition, in Goebbels' speech, there was a section that severely criticized the Soviet Union, to the point of complete destruction. His words were: "Bolshevism is an act of insane crime. It was invented by Jews, led by Jews, and used to annihilate the civilized nations of Europe and establish Jewish international hegemony. Bolshevism is actually a despicable dictatorship. The Bolshevik Party relies on deception to seize power and on violence to maintain power. … Therefore, the question of Bolshevism is actually a question of the life and death of Europe. We must either support or oppose Bolshevism, and we must choose one or the other, regardless of everything. As for the internal struggles of Russian Bolshevism, they are actually domestic infighting among Jews. Because the Jews are ambitious and deliberately destructive, they will inevitably turn on each other in the end, and then Jews will kill Jews. … Now, during the National Socialist Party Congress, we are sounding the alarm. That Soviet Russia is not the motherland of the workers. The Russian government is almost entirely organized by Jews. There are no workers in it. Soviet Russia has not implemented the dictatorship of the proletariat; it is only a Jewish dictatorship." At this point, Goebbels again listed the names of senior Soviet officials, slandering them, saying that the head of the Soviet political police, Yagoda, the People's Commissar for Transportation and Stalin's son-in-law, Kaganovich, and the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov, their original names were Jewish, and although they later changed to Russian names, they were all from Jewish slums. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<h3>Anti-Jewish Struggle Continues</h3>
<p>Nuremberg The National Socialist Party Congress continued to meet today. Wagner, the leader of the Party's monastic district branch, delivered a speech saying, "Some say that since the laws on Jews were promulgated last September, our country has completely resolved the Jewish question. I should say that Jews are still continuing their struggle. Our country's anti-Jewish struggle should continue. If the people of all countries can understand that this is related to the survival of the nation, then the final victory will belong to this Party." (Havas, 11th)</p>
<h3>Racial Laws Enforced Vigorously Marriage Loans Are Huge Small Loans Enable 600,000 People to Have Families</h3>
<p>Nuremberg Interior Minister Dr. Frick said today at the German Public Law Scholars Congress that National Socialist Germany intends to abide by its racial laws without being swayed by foreign critics. The doctor also said that the government's marriage loans have so far reached 350 million marks, enabling 600,000 people to have families. In 1934, a total of 672 people had their reproductive functions eliminated, which decreased to 324 in 1935. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<h3>Russian-Czech Military Cooperation Czech Rejects German Fabrication of Facts</h3>
<p>Prague, Czech Republic German Propaganda Minister Goebbels gave a speech at the National Socialist Party Congress in that country yesterday, which involved the mutual relations between the Soviet Union and the Czech Republic. The Czech government recently issued a communiqué stating, "It is surprising that Goebbels actually cited rumors that the Soviet Union and the Czech Republic have established military cooperation to deal with a certain country, and that the Soviet army has built an airfield in the Czech Republic. In fact, this information is entirely fabricated." (Havas, 11th)</p>
<h3>Moscow Newspaper Commentary German Aggressive Ambitions Are Obvious</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Regarding Hitler's speech, the Truth newspaper said, "Hitler's speech is actually a confession, which contains many confessions that are extremely unfavorable to the Fascists themselves. The German leader once said, 'Guaranteeing peace,' but now he clearly says that the Krupp factory is working very well, exceeding the enemies of the Germans." Is this not clear evidence of an arms race? He once promised the people a "Fascist paradise," but now he claims that certain items will be scarce in the future, especially food. Is this not an acknowledgment of the poor prospects of hunger and malnutrition?</p>
<p>"The speech frankly states that increasing wages is impossible. This is actually a sad plea from an empty government to people with rosy cheeks. Now, when the Fascist Party hears demands for wage increases, it feels a headache and claims that 'increasing wages and reducing working hours are crazy actions.' In the eyes of the Fascists, this is indeed the case. The national treasury is gradually emptying, cash reserves are gradually decreasing, and there is no currency to buy food. All of this is because the last penny of currency reserves has been used to increase armaments.</p>
<p>"The speech makes very few statements about foreign policy, but one point is very clear: Germany will never give up its demands for colonies. The aggressive nature of German policy, as well as the hunger and poverty of the German people, are undeniable facts. "If we remove all of the anti-Soviet deception, the speech will be nothing. What does it promise to the German people? Hunger, the most brutal terror, war, and aggression. The opening act of the Fascist Congress was clearly not successful. No amount of anti-Soviet propaganda and innuendo can save them. The ugly and terrifying reality of Fascist Germany has completely penetrated the anti-Soviet rhetoric and all deception and fraud."</p>
<p>The News Agency's editorial said, "Hitler's guests were completely disappointed. What they saw was a cliché and dull scene. After watching this performance, even the most unambitious viewers in the most remote villages will demand refunds. The News Agency refuted Hitler's claims of "the splendor of German culture" and "Germany's prosperity," continuing, "The clowning and castles in the air in Nuremberg have now come to a complete end. Hitler has forgotten that he was once seen as a professional peace advocate and suddenly returned to the 'ravings of Germany's overpopulation,' which he repeatedly discussed in 'Mein Kampf,' and used to justify his inevitable imperialist aggressive policies. "Hitler failed to deliver a peaceful speech. He could only reiterate his aggressive policies. We must say frankly that Hitler's description of part of his imperialist attempts is easier to understand and more organized than the first half of his speech, which was empty and full of fantasies." (TASS, 10th)</p>

<h3>Final Act of Russian Military Maneuvers Performance of Airborne Transportation of Troops Swift Movements Leave Observers Speechless</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Today was the last day of the Soviet Russian Red Army's large-scale maneuvers held in Minsk, between Moscow and Berlin. In the final act, 1,200 soldiers, carrying parts for 18 cannons and 150 machine guns, simultaneously jumped from airplanes, parachuting to the ground. The soldiers in each landing area assembled the cannons and machine guns in eight minutes, attacked the enemy from the rear, and defeated them. It is said that the Soviet Russian maneuvers were extremely mechanized. Four Soviet Russian army generals observed the maneuvers in person. Only General Blyukher, commander of the Siberian Red Army, did not participate. Foreign observers included representatives from Britain, France, and the Czech Republic. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) In the Soviet Russian Red Army's large-scale maneuvers, an air force battle is now being staged. Many high-speed bombers, fighters, and warplanes are participating. After flying over 170 kilometers, the airplanes dropped 1,200 soldiers with 150 machine guns and 18 cannons behind the "enemy" lines, taking only seven or eight minutes. All of these extremely complex movements were carried out under new conditions and were fully consistent with the original strategy. The paratroopers jumped down carrying guns and ammunition, and the cannons were dropped from the airplanes at the same time. People's Defense Commissar Marshal Voroshilov extremely praised and thanked the soldiers who participated in this action.</p>
<p>Foreign military observation groups discussed this action with Voroshilov. British representative General Wavell said that he would not have believed it possible to carry out this kind of action if he had not seen it with his own eyes. French chief representatives Generals Schweisguth and Vulmin paid special attention to the orderly manner in which these extremely complex actions were carried out. They said, "The landing of airborne soldiers raises many questions." The Czech delegation and its leader, General Rucha, also expressed to Voroshilov that they were extremely impressed by the actions carried out by the pilots and paratroopers. Voroshilov pointed out the bravery of the paratroopers and said that this was nothing more than peacetime training to make our respectable people even stronger. Indeed, there is room for discussion on the implementation of airborne troops in combat situations, but this kind of action deserves extreme attention, as there is no doubt that it is valuable." (TASS, 10th)</p>
<h3>Russian Military Exercises in the Far East Airborne Artillery Battle Described 1,200 Participants Commanded by Blyukher</h3>
<p>(Harbin) According to Japanese sources, the Soviet government, in view of the increasingly serious situation in the Far East, has conducted several airborne transportation exercises in the eastern border area, and the results have been very satisfactory. At the same time as the large-scale maneuvers were held in the western border area yesterday, 1,200 air defense exercise personnel were dispatched, with Khabarovsk as the center, and the airborne artillery tactics between Moscow and Khabarovsk were carried out under the personal command of Blyukher, commander of the Red Army in the Far East. More than 800 elite machine guns participated in the exercises, and the situation was extremely tense. (Hualian, 11th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Puppet Government Promotes Militarism and Plans to Hold Anti-Russian Propaganda Conference</h3>
<p>(Changchun) The Japanese "Manchukuo" authorities, in order to incite anti-Soviet sentiments among the people and actively prepare to invade Siberia, have decided to take advantage of the anniversary of September 18th to hold a large-scale anti-Soviet propaganda conference. They are now openly soliciting dozens of Japanese and Chinese anti-Soviet slogans, which are being widely disseminated within the puppet Manchukuo. They are also holding roving lecture meetings in various places and conducting large-scale land and air force exercises with the Soviet Far Eastern Red Army as the hypothetical enemy in order to promote militarism. (Hualian, 16th)</p>
<h3>British Troops Transferred to the Far East</h3>
<p>(London) The transport ship "Lancashire," carrying 1,200 officers and soldiers, recently set sail from Hampton Harbour to the Far East. Among them, some army and naval officers were assigned to China, and a batch of air force officers and soldiers were sent to Iraq, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Another army team was assigned to Egypt and various places in the Far East. According to British practice, troop rotations are usually carried out in September. The officers and soldiers carried by the "Lancashire" this time are the first batch. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<h3>The Situation of the Western Rebel Army Grows Daily; The North and South Routes Successfully Link Up, Forming a Besieging Stance Against Madrid; The Northern War Situation Becomes Quiet</h3>
<p>Burgos: Yesterday, the Southern Route National Army occupied the town of Alena in Avila Province. The North and South Route front lines have now successfully linked up, and the situation of besieging the capital of Madrid is becoming increasingly pressing. The Southern Route Army Cavalry advanced from Avila Province and joined forces with the infantry belonging to the Northern Route Army, defeating the government troops and killing 250 enemy soldiers.

<p>Madrid: Today, the government announced that the government troops have extended 18 miles in front of the Estremadura front line near Talavera. It also claimed that General Asensio is currently flanking the right wing of the rebel army. However, according to a message broadcasted by the Seville rebel radio station on the 3rd, the rebel army advanced 7 miles in front of the Estremadura front line and has crossed Talavera. The war on the San Sebastian front has suddenly become quiet in recent days, so it is expected that negotiations for a peaceful handover of the city are currently underway. The Civil Governor of the city, Walterka, issued a statement saying that negotiations are indeed taking place, but the claim that the People's Front is splitting is a rumor. Today, the garrison in the capital has been increased by 5,000 militiamen from Catalonia. It is heard that the arrival of this reinforcement has cost the government one-third of the gold reserves of the Bank of Spain. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>

<p>San Sebastian Resembles a Dead City</p>
<p>San Sebastian Port: The military situation here has not changed. Neither the government troops nor the National Army has taken any action. Extremists in the city are trying hard to regain power. All shops have closed, and vehicles have disappeared, making it a dead city. Only members of the Basque Nationalist Party patrol the streets to maintain order. The general public is extremely frightened that the National Army will begin attacking the city at night, so a large number of women and children are gathering at the coastal docks, waiting for ships to escape to France. The scene is extremely tragic. It is learned that the city of Hernani, 9 kilometers away from here, was bombed by aircraft belonging to the National Army, killing 4 residents and injuring 8. The city authorities have now ordered all residents to evacuate. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Government Troops' Aircraft Bomb Oviedo</p>
<p>Madrid: It was announced here today that a team of Asturian government troops, wanting to scout the rebel forces' defenses in Oviedo, penetrated deep into the city.

Twenty militiamen have surrendered to the government army. An Associated Press reporter reported that when government aircraft bombed Oviedo, several houses were destroyed. There is no general offensive at present, only sporadic attacks in various places to disrupt the rebel army's morale. (National dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>Spanish Communist Congressman Clashes with French Ambassador</h3>
<p>(Paris) French Ambassador to Spain, Herbette, recently clashed with Communist Congressman Orlondo in the port of San Sebastian, Spain. A correspondent of the "Le Matin" stationed in Hendaye reported the incident as follows: On that day, a group of foreign and Spanish refugees, all carrying formal passports, planned to board the French warship "Triton" from the port of San Sebastian to take refuge in France. Herbette went to the dock to take care of them in person. Unexpectedly, Orlondo stepped forward to stop them aggressively, "even raising his fist to strike the French ambassador. The ambassador then pushed him back with his right shoulder and told him, 'I am the French ambassador, how dare you use violence?' Oviedo replied, 'I don't want to hit him, but this gentleman may have to be pushed into the sea.' At this point, Ambassador Herbette ignored Orlondo and ordered the refugees to continue boarding the ship. Only after everything was finished did he leave the dock. Another version of the story says that Oviedo pushed a civilian and accidentally touched Mrs. Herbette. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>

<h3>Turkish Fleet to Cruise the Mediterranean; Invited by the British Naval Department; To Visit Greece in Return</h3>
<p>Ankara, Turkey: According to today's news, the Turkish fleet will depart for a cruise in the Mediterranean on October 18, led by the battleship "Yavuz" (formerly the German battleship "Goeben"). It will first go to Malta, as invited by the British Naval Department. It will then go to Piraeus to reciprocate the visit of the Greek fleet to Istanbul last year. Political circles here attach great importance to this decision, as this is the first time a Turkish fleet has left its territorial waters since Kemal took office as president in 1923. In addition to the "Yavuz" (22,500 tons, armed with ten 11-inch guns), the Turkish fleet also includes the cruiser "Hamidiye" (3,830 tons) and the "Mecidiye" (3,300 tons), as well as two gunboats, three minesweepers, four destroyers, three torpedo boats, five submarines, and one survey ship.

The public applauded and cheered. The Prime Minister's speech mainly stated, "Today I inspected the youth teams.

People around the world should know that the entire Italian nation is like this." (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>Roman Newspaper Advocates for Italian-German Alliance Against Communism; Two Major Forces Compete for Supremacy; Will Inevitably Form an International Conflict</h3>
<p>(Rome) "Il Giornale d'Italia" recently published an article signed by Malavaglia, advocating that Italy and Germany unite to oppose Bolshevism. It stated, "Italy and Germany have each destroyed destructive revolutions within their own countries and have begun constructive revolutions. Now, willing to follow the principles of European civilization, they jointly transform the international order. In general, Italy and Germany jointly bear the responsibility of dealing with Bolshevism in all of Europe. The struggle between the Fascist Party and the Bolshevik Party has become widespread. The nature of this struggle is not a rebellion against the old world, but a competition between two new worlds. The so-called old world has already died out or has only a remnant of life. Therefore, Fascism and Bolshevism, these two revolutionary forces, compete with each other to inherit the legacy of the old world. These two forces are competing for supremacy in various countries in Europe in various forms, but soon they may break through national boundaries and transform into an international conflict."

<h3>Results of Romanian-Yugoslavian Talks Show Unified Diplomatic Policy; Friendship Between the Two Countries Becomes Closer</h3>

<h3>British Trade Union Congress and Labor Party Refuse to Cooperate with the Communist Party</h3>
<p>Portsmouth: The Trade Union Congress continued its meeting today to discuss the issue of the Labor Party and the Communist Party forming a united front. It was immediately and unanimously rejected, with only a few votes in favor. Prior to this, a majority of representatives made strong speeches, urging the Labor Party to pay attention, saying that "the Communist Party is currently ingratiating itself with the Labor Party, hoping to input various communist principles into the Labor Party, and we must guard against it." (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) The Communist Party's proposal to the Labor Party has been explicitly rejected by Sir Citrine, Secretary-General of the Trade Union Congress, at today's general meeting. Citrine said that the Communist Party has arbitrarily ridiculed and insulted the Labor Party for many years, and now it is trying to curry favor with organized labor. This is one of the most interesting things in modern political history. The Communist Party has adopted this method for a very simple reason, because their repeated attempts to manipulate the labor movement have obviously failed miserably, so they have suddenly changed their plans. Although the British Communist Party has been engaged in subsidized propaganda for many years, it still has a limited number of members in the country and cannot occupy any position in the minds of voters. We must not be misled by the claim that the Communist Party represents labor. The Liberal Party is no longer a major political force. After three years of struggle between the Labor Party and the Liberal Party, someone is now asking the Labor Party to engage in restoration. When we hold our heads high like this, there is no danger of Fascism growing in Britain. Citrine concluded by saying that the recent changes in France were achieved by the People's Front making good use of electoral means, so they did not fight each other in the electoral system. However, it is impossible for Britain to achieve the same effect. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Portuguese Government to Carry Out a Large-Scale Cleansing of Communism; Naval Mutiny Clearly Shows Communist Characteristics; Civil Servants Must Swear Allegiance to the Constitution</h3>
<p>Lisbon: According to a statement issued to newspapers by the Portuguese government today, the government is about to carry out a large-scale cleansing of communism throughout the country. This is the consequence of the recent mutiny of two warships. The statement said that the government had long known that a conspiracy was brewing. The government could have avoided the naval mutiny, but sometimes it had to consider international relations, which was more important than the loss. Since the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, Spanish and Portuguese secret agents and some Portuguese have been engaged in active propaganda in Portugal. The poison of this propaganda among the Portuguese soldiers on the two warships led them to plan to occupy the two warships and join their communist comrades. Portuguese warships can be sunk, but no other flags should be hoisted except the Portuguese flag. The article insults Portugal as a regret. It also said that the government now has to step up its offensive against communism. According to another order issued recently, from now on, all those holding national positions, whether they are administrators or autonomous civil servants, as well as Portuguese representatives stationed abroad and prospective professors of national universities, must swear allegiance to the Constitution of Portugal. The oath includes a clause that actively rejects communism and other improper ideologies. Army and navy officers and soldiers must swear to respect the national flag in lieu of a written declaration.

<h3>Strikes Rise and Fall; The Situation in France is Serious</h3>

Matters discussed: (1) The draft general budget for local ordinary income and expenditure for Ningxia Province in the 24th year of the Republic of China.

(8) The case of the Regulations and Amortization Table for Reorganizing Guangdong's Financial Public Debt in the 25th year of the Republic of China was resolved and passed with amendments. (Central News Agency dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Regulations for Reorganizing Guangdong's Financial Public Debt in the 25th year of the Republic of China, passed by the Legislative Yuan on the 11th, are as follows: Article 1. In order to reorganize Guangdong's finances and enrich the preparation of mill receipts, the National Government issues public debt, named the Regulations for Reorganizing Guangdong's Financial Public Debt in the 25th year of the Republic of China. Article 2. The fixed amount of this public debt is 120 million yuan in national currency. Article 3. This public debt is scheduled to be issued on October 1, 1936. Article 4. The interest rate of this public debt is set at 4% per annum, with interest paid twice a year on March 31 and September 30. Article 5. The term of this public debt is set at 30 years, with principal repaid twice a year on March 31 and September 30. The principal will be repaid at 3% per annum for the first 20 years and 4% per annum for the last 10 years. By September 30, 1966, the principal and interest will be fully repaid. The foregoing repayment of principal shall be carried out by lottery. Article 6. The funds for the principal and interest of this public debt shall be allocated from the collection of consolidated taxes in the Guangdong area. The Ministry of Finance shall order the Tax Affairs Department to allocate the amount of principal and interest due each time on a monthly average to the account of this public debt under the National Debt Fund Management Committee in the Central Bank for storage and payment in accordance with the provisions of the Amortization Table. Article 7. The Central Bank is designated to manage the repayment of principal and interest of this public debt. Article 8. The face value of this public debt is divided into four types: 10 yuan, 100 yuan, 1,000 yuan, and 10,000 yuan, all of which are unregistered. Article 9.

Those who commit forgery and damage the credit of this public debt shall be punished by the judicial organs according to law. Article 11. These regulations shall be implemented from the date of promulgation. (Central News Agency dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The case of the Regulations for Reorganizing Guangdong's Financial Public Debt in the 25th year of the Republic of China was carefully studied during the review process in the Legislative Yuan. Ma Yinchu, chairman of the Finance Committee of the Yuan, reported on the review process of the case at the Yuan meeting on the 11th, stating that the purpose of the Ministry of Finance's issuance of public debt for reorganizing Guangdong's finances was originally to compensate for the shortage of preparations for mill receipts in Guangdong Province, so as to stabilize the credit of mill receipts, and then gradually seek to reorganize and implement legal tender. However, when the committee initially reviewed the case, it was unanimously believed that the exchange rate of mill dollars used in Guangdong Province was unstable compared with the current legal tender. Even if the preparation was made up and the price was stabilized, it would still be necessary to find another way to unify the finances in the future. It would be better to take this opportunity to make a fundamental reorganization, issue legal tender, and recover mill receipts, which would not only kill two birds with one stone, but also achieve twice the result with half the effort. Therefore, at that time, both parties had slightly different opinions on the reorganization of Guangdong's finances. Later, when the committee held its second meeting to review the case, representatives of the Ministry of Finance came to the Yuan to explain again that there were difficulties in adopting radical measures in the political, economic, and financial aspects of reorganizing Guangdong's finances. The committee members also unanimously sympathized and completed the review according to the original plan. Whether it is appropriate or not, please have the Yuan meeting approve it. After the words were finished, all the commissioners had no objection, and the case was successfully passed. (Central News Agency dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At the meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 11th, the Municipal Autonomy Law and the County and Municipal Autonomy Law, which were passed by the Third Session of the Eighth-Sixth Meeting of the previous winter, were further revised based on the principles of local autonomy laws and regulations promulgated by the Central Government and by referring to the revised situation of the County Autonomy Law. After the revision, the Municipal Autonomy Law is still divided into nine chapters: the establishment of the city, the autonomous matters of the city, the citizens of the city, the citizens' congress, the city council, the municipal government, the city's financial district, and the supplementary provisions, totaling 68 articles, which is two articles less than the original proposal. The main points of the revision are to abolish the original "Lu Lin" in the organization of the districts under the city and change it to "Bao Jia". Ten households form a "Jia", and a "Jia" head is established. Ten "Jia" form a "Bao", and a "Bao" head is established. Ten or more "Bao" form a "District", and the rest are the same as the original plan. As for the Implementation Law of the County and Municipal Autonomy Law after the revision, the former has 17 articles and the latter has 16 articles. Except for the addition of "The county may, due to its geographical area, population, economy, culture, and other special circumstances, submit a report to the superior agency for approval to guide autonomous affairs by districts", the rest are only textual modifications.

<h3>Wang Kemin Shows Signs of Passivity</h3>
<p>Tianjin: Wang Kemin talked about meeting with Tashiro after arriving in Tianjin. Based on the previous negotiation stage in the north, he inquired about opinions on economic cooperation. Tashiro still asked our side to show its opinions first, and his words were close to procrastination. Finally, he said that after Song arrived in Tianjin, he could first inquire about his opinions and then discuss them. Judging from the current situation, the key still lies in what scope the Japanese side is willing to show, and then the central government can consider accepting the method. The South Manchuria Railway and the Kwantung Army have little to do with this issue. All important responsibilities lie with the North China Army. Nagai, the consul, visited me on the 10th, only for a general visit. He has not met with Song since he arrived in Tianjin. However, I have been ashamed of not making any progress since I received the commission from the Economic Council on July 13, which is now two months. Judging from the current situation, even if I take office, it will be difficult to proceed as desired. It is better to withdraw than to be anxious. Therefore, when I meet with Song, I will return the commission. At 3 p.m. on the 11th, Tajiri, accompanied by Nishida, the vice-consul, visited Wang Kemin at No. 3, Xinzhenghouli, No. 33 Yingjie Road. They talked for a long time. (Special dispatch, 11th)</p>

<h3>Yellow River Floodwaters Receding Slowly, Middle and Lower Reaches of Shandong Still Mostly Dangerous; Luokou Water Level Continues to Rise; Kong Xiangrong Inspects Lower Reaches</h3>
<p>Jinan Communication: The flood in the Yellow River at Shanzhou has passed. Lisheng Village in the upstream of this province has begun to recede since the day before yesterday. However, the middle and lower sections not only have not fallen, but have increased. The water level at Luokou, a dozen miles north of Jinan City, was 31.1 meters at 8:00 p.m. last night. Today (the 10th), it rose to 31.15 meters at 6:00 a.m. and 31.21 meters at 2:00 p.m., with a continuing upward trend. The highest recorded water level at Luokou was 31.4 meters in 1933. It has not reached this figure in the past two years. Based on this year's situation, it is feared that it may break the 31.4-meter mark. This abnormal phenomenon of upstream decline and downstream increase is mainly due to the blockage of the estuary, hindering discharge. Kong Xiangrong, chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, decided to request 1.2 million yuan from the central government to purchase four dredgers and start dredging the estuary next spring. He also plans to build a stone dam at the estuary. Kong himself led Wu Nankai, the chief engineer of the commission, from Jinan to the estuary downstream this morning to inspect and design. The River Affairs Bureau considers Luokou to be the gateway to the provincial capital. The rising water level in recent days is feared to be dangerous. Last night, the bureau selected ten staff members from each department, led by Zhao Youzeng, the chief of the audit section, to be stationed in the upper and lower sections of Luokou to direct the laborers in defense. Zhao Luren, the chief of the general affairs section, also went to inspect the various sections of Luokou this morning. Fortunately, the south bank is very high and is entirely stone坝 (embankment/dam), which is relatively solid. Coupled with the discharge in the middle of the river, it should be safe. This morning, the south bank embankment was submerged by 1.56 to 2 meters of water. The north bank is low, almost level with the water. If it rises further, there may be a danger of overflowing. The turbulent waves in the river are拍浮 (lapping/splashing) against both banks. The water roaring under the iron bridge is like thunder, audible for miles. The masts of the ships are also visible for miles beyond the堤 (embankment/dike). The residents' temporary straw sheds on the river滩 (beach/bank) have been moved to the embankment. There is a car码头 (wharf/pier) at Gaijiagou below Luokou to transport cars across the river by boat. Currently, due to the high water, the码头 (wharf/pier) has been submerged. The small boats carrying passengers on both banks are also finding it difficult due to the high water. It takes two hours to cross from this bank to the other bank. According to river workers, if the溜 (current/flow) does not change, the water level at Luokou will not be a major problem even if it rises further. However, there is always a danger of抽刷 (erosion/scouring) when the water recedes, which cannot be ignored.</p>
<h3>Yang Yongtai Discusses Methods for Reviving Rural Hubei; Striving to Improve Varieties, Provide Storage and Inspection, Effectively Organize Baotou, Establish Various Cooperatives, and Train District Administration Personnel as the Backbone for Promoting Rural Administration</h3>
<p>Hankou Communication: Hubei Province has had a bumper harvest of rice and wheat this year, which has not been seen in more than a decade. The cotton production also ranks third in the country. After years of natural disasters and man-made calamities, the bankrupt rural areas have received deep relief, not only bringing joy to the countryside but also to the markets. Fearing that low grain prices would harm farmers, the provincial government has put forward opinions, requesting the Executive Yuan to pay close attention. At the same time, taking advantage of this opportunity, it has promoted the "Six Modernizations" policy and is actively promoting the recovery of rural areas, seeking fundamental reforms. To understand the content of this plan, this newspaper reporter visited Yang Yongtai, chairman of the provincial government, who told us about the methods for reviving rural areas, which are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Methods for Reviving Rural Areas</p>
<p>Yang said that in recent years, the entire rural area of our country has tended to go bankrupt, and Hubei is no exception. Not only have there been years of disasters, but many farmers have had to fill their stomachs with grass roots, tree bark, and观音土 (kaolin). Even if they occasionally have a bumper harvest, low prices and low grain prices harm farmers, so that although they can barely make a living through hard work all year round, they still cannot afford to buy clothes. As a result,歉 (deficiency) becomes a disaster, and abundance also becomes a disaster. This is due to the lack of adjustment in the entire national economy, and the failure to effectively improve agriculture itself is a major factor. Now, the first slogan for improving agriculture in Hubei is "Agricultural Scientification" and "Agricultural Industrialization." Our country is based on agriculture, but purely agricultural products, such as rice, wheat, cotton, tobacco, sugar, flour, and agricultural manufactured products, are imported from abroad every year, with a value of over 600 million yuan, which is disheartening. Hubei produces approximately 2 to 3 million dan of cotton each year, ranking third in the country, which cannot be said to be insignificant. However, foreign cotton still flows in continuously because the quality of cotton is poor. Therefore, foreign cotton must still be used to spin 25-count yarn. To make domestic cotton sell well, it is necessary to improve cotton varieties and strictly prohibit adulteration with water and other substances. The rice and wheat themselves also need to be improved. We must pay attention to water conservancy and use new agricultural tools. With selection, fertilization, weeding, and pest control, using some science, agricultural production will naturally increase. The government, on the other hand, will set up warehouses for storage, set up bureaus for inspection, improve the quality, strictly set standards, and improve rural financial organizations. In the future, domestic production and sales can be expected to meet supply and demand, and the import of舶来品 (imported goods) will not be difficult to stop. As for the farmers' working time, they are only busy with farming for 120 days a year, and the remaining nine months are spare time. Farmers' labor can be used to develop other industries. It is best to engage in rural side businesses, such as gardening, fruit trees, vegetables, flower cultivation, animal husbandry, horses, cattle, sheep, pigs, chickens, ducks, bees, fish, etc. In terms of handicrafts, such as brewing土酒 (local wine), making soy sauce, ginning cotton, spinning, weaving, paper making, and engaging in藤工 (rattan work),蓆工 (mat work), bamboo编 (weaving), and 麻制 (hemp products). They can also use lakes and swamps to catch fish and pick lotus, and use mountainous areas to plant forests and hunt. These side businesses only require farmers' labor, which is farmers' capital, which can greatly help the revival of rural areas. The second slogan is "Rural Baotouization" and "Rural Cooperatization." Because farmers have shallow knowledge and stubborn ideas, it is necessary to have a practical organization to promote agricultural scientification and agricultural industrialization. In politics, it is the organization of baotou, and in economics, it is the establishment of various cooperatives. These are the two most important organizations in rural areas. It can also be said that cooperation is the economic baotou of rural areas, and blood baotou is the political cooperation of rural areas. A well-managed baotou system can not only maintain治安 (public security) in a passive way, but also actively promote all construction projects. The various cooperatives have many conveniences. With credit cooperatives, farmers can use funds. With utilization cooperatives, those who need to purchase new tools or materials related to production due to improved farming or agricultural product processing, which one person cannot afford, can jointly invest, purchase, and operate through utilization cooperatives to increase production. With consumer and sales cooperatives, farmers can purchase and sell daily necessities and agricultural products directly to the market without being manipulated by merchants. These various cooperatives must be established one by one in rural areas. The third slogan is "Farmer Groupization" and "Farmer Training." On the one hand, they participate in壮丁队 (strong-arm teams),保安队 (security teams), and义勇队 (volunteer corps). On the other hand, they jointly manage afforestation, road construction, flood prevention, drought prevention, and various construction projects. By only using labor and not spending money, they can achieve the goal of increasing production. In the future, we will implement the proposed slogans in a practical manner.</p>
<p>Personnel for Promoting Rural Administration</p>
<p>The reporter further asked about the organizations and personnel for promoting the Six Modernizations policy. Yang said that people call the county magistrate the people-loving official, but in reality, the county magistrate does not have many opportunities to contact the people. To promote rural administration, district chiefs and district staff must be used because district chiefs are in the countryside and their every move directly affects the general public. Their position is not only the ears and eyes of the county magistrate but also the leader of rural construction. The联保 (joint guarantee) directors and联保 (joint guarantee) secretaries of each township are the cadres of rural construction who are connected with each other. Therefore, the district chief is also the pivot for connecting the upper and lower levels and bears the major responsibility for rural construction. In response to this need, the province has already set up district offices, which will soon cover the entire province. The training of district administration personnel has now been carried out to the third term. The purpose of district administration training is to enable district administration personnel to develop both文武兼修 (literary and martial arts) and to be both君师并作 (rulers and teachers), using "管 (management), 教 (education), 养 (nurturing), 卫 (protection)" to address the root causes of the people's "散 (scattered), 愚 (ignorant), 贫 (poor), 弱 (weak)" and thoroughly cure them. There are currently four problems with administrative personnel: first, compromise, accommodation, and perfunctoriness; second, inertia, lethargy, lack of energy, and lack of motivation; third, embellishment and hypocrisy; and fourth, waste and squandering. I encourage district administration personnel to adopt four-干 (doing/working) spirits, that is, to use "硬干 (hard work)" to cure compromise and accommodation, "快干 (fast work)" to cure inertia and lethargy, "实干 (practical work)" to cure embellishment and hypocrisy, and "苦干 (hardship work)" to cure waste and squandering. If district administration personnel can adopt this spirit of砥砺 (encouragement) and practice, then the success of district administration lies here, and the revival of rural areas also lies here.

<h3>Rampant Bandits in Zhangzhou Prefecture, Fujian; Raiders Operate in Small Groups, Inflicting Utterly Cruel Suffering; Farmers Face Appalling Tax Burdens</h3>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: Haicheng County, only forty *li* from Zhangzhou, is located on the coast at the mouth of the Jiulong River and is a wealthy area under Zhangzhou jurisdiction. After June, when bandits in southern Fujian began to stir, Haicheng also suffered from banditry. However, the bandits in Haicheng are neither like the large groups of local militia and bandits in Quanzhou Prefecture, nor like the communist bandits in western Fujian and Zhangzhou Prefecture. They are merely small groups of twenty or thirty people, yet their harm is even more severe than that of the large groups. Since late July, they have become extremely rampant, dividing into four groups: (1) the Huang Hedong group in the Shanhoushan, Xiguan, and Pi Ban areas; (2) the Huang Guotai group in the Daogang and Yuzhen Hengni areas; (3) the Hong Datou group outside the East Gate; (4) the Zheng Beizai group in Banzi. They occupy the four rural areas, and almost everything outside the county seat has become a communist-controlled area. They kidnap, plunder, kill, and maim with extreme cruelty. According to statistics, from July 20 to August 20, within one month, 34 villagers were killed, 63 were kidnapped, and 2,000 people were displaced and fled. Each of these four groups of bandits has only twenty to thirty people. Furthermore, according to a petition submitted by the Haicheng native association in Xiamen to the county government and pacification commissioner at the end of last month, "In the Haicheng area, bandits kidnap, rob, set fires, and kill dozens of times a month. The four groups, Huang Hedong, etc., each have no more than twenty or thirty people, yet in twenty days, there have been about twenty known bandit cases. Haicheng has a stationed company, a security team of forty men, a militia cadre team of sixty men, and thirty police officers, totaling more than two hundred soldiers and police, yet they allow small groups of bandits to do as they please." The petition includes a list of twenty bandit cases in two weeks. For example, the Kokeng community was attacked by bandits on the 26th, and the community leader, Lin Shigen, and four others were killed on the spot, and four people were kidnapped. Two of them were beheaded by the bandits, who sent their heads back to their families as a demonstration. This illustrates the ferocity of the bandits. At the end of August, the Haicheng County government offered rewards for the capture of the four bandit leaders: 1,000 yuan each for Huang Guotai and Huang Hedong, and 800 yuan each for Hong Datou and Zheng Beizai, with half the reward for killing them. However, the bandits have not been subdued at all. In early September, several new bandit leaders emerged: (1) Chen Jinquan, based in Lingdong; (2) Chen Lianqing, based in Lubian; (3) Gan Hai'e of Fenglin community; (4) Gan Shui of Cangli community; (5) Gan Shuzhi of Huangkang community; (6) Gan Jiangquan of Zhongcuo community; (7) Gan Baitang of Gangkou community, all with ten or more people or just a few, together with the Huang and Zheng Hong four groups, they widely distribute "black lists" in various villages. The so-called "black list" is a notice informing someone to pay a certain amount of money; if they fail to pay by the deadline, they will be kidnapped, killed, or their house will be burned. From September 2 to 7, each village was assigned between 300 and 1,000 such notices. The documented amount for those with verifiable victims and amounts is more than 28,000 yuan. The "black lists" were printed in blue ink on newspaper and bore the inscription "Third Brigade of the Fujian Provincial Independent Corps of the Chinese People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army" with a forged seal. As a result, there is terror in various villages, and villagers are scattering and fleeing. No one dares to harvest the rice. More than a thousand villagers near the town enter the city at night to escape the bandits and sleep in the open. In addition, the burning of houses and the theft of cattle are countless. Therefore, although the ten bandit groups in Haicheng are all small, their harm is greater than that of other counties. Furthermore, the tax burden on the villagers of Haicheng is extremely heavy. In addition to temporary levies and the purchase of firearms, as well as the extraction of one to three *dou* of unhusked rice after each *dou* of planted crops is harvested, the known tax items include: Baojia expenses, local gazetteer office expenses, anti-superstition donations, Baozhang office expenses, director office expenses, militia cadre team expenses, a certain cadre team bullet expenses, cadre team soldier subsidies, patrol expenses, patrol bullet expenses, patrol soldier subsidies, county Baojia expenses, district office telephone expenses, training expenses, county government messenger miscellaneous expenses, security team bullet expenses, aircraft donations, police uniform expenses, stationed troops' house repair expenses, district office house repair expenses, sports expenses, district men's salary expenses, deficit expenses, second civilian labor expenses, Bao Lian establishment expenses, registration certificate fees, militia roster fees, Bao Lian special expenses, district team leader salary expenses. These are 29 items. The above only refers to the common burdens on farmers; other temporary and commercial taxes are not included. Therefore, there is now a saying in Haicheng about three things that are abundant: bandits are abundant, taxes are abundant, and refugees are abundant. (September 11)</p>
<h3>Details of the Murder of Japanese Resident Nakano in Haibu, Guangdong; The Deceased Had Been in China for Over Twenty Years and Was a Local Expert in Beihai; The Japanese Consulate Will Send Personnel to Investigate the Truth of the Incident</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: The murder of Japanese resident Junzo Nakano occurred on the 3rd of this month in the port of Beihai, Guangdong Province. This matter has been reported in various telegrams in recent days. Local news suggests that Nakano either committed suicide out of anger or provoked trouble by arguing with locals. The Japanese Consulate in Guangzhou received news of the incident on the 8th. As Consul-General Nakamura had gone to Shanghai the previous week on official business, the consulate has not yet made any statement. Deputy Consul Seichiku Sadaharu has only sent a secretary and notified the Guangdong Provincial Government of the case, as well as reporting to the Japanese Embassy in China and planning to send personnel to the scene to investigate the truth of the matter. According to news from Beihai, the murdered Japanese man, Junzo Nakano, was 52 years old. He came to the port of Beihai over twenty years ago and opened a "Maruichi" pharmacy, also selling Japanese-made children's toys and other sundries. Over the years, his business was doing well, so Nakano married a local woman in Beihai and had children. Later, he took a concubine and also had children. Nakano has resided in Beihai for over twenty years, and through constant exposure, he has become a local expert in Beihai. He speaks the Beihai dialect just like a local, and few know that he is a foreigner. Nakano's life was comfortable. In addition to doing business, he often traveled to the interior of Guangdong, venturing deep into remote forests and occasionally going to rural villages. Although locals secretly guarded against these personal activities, he relied on foreign power for protection, so they could do nothing about it. Recently, as Nakano was familiar with local conditions and relied on the authority of a foreigner, he often interfered excessively in local public affairs, and local people's feelings towards him deteriorated. On the afternoon of the 3rd, several locals entered the Maruichi pharmacy, intending to buy eyeglasses. Because they could not agree on the price, Nakano came out. It is unknown how, but he argued with the customers, and then they started fighting. Nakano was no match and was stabbed by the visitors, suffering serious injuries. After the incident, the assailants fled. By the time the police arrived, the culprits were gone. Nakano's wife went to the Beihai Public Security Bureau to report the case. The bureau immediately dispatched a large number of armed police to search for the suspects, but after searching for half the night, they still found nothing. The head of the Public Security Bureau, Chen Zhen, went to Hepu City the next day to report to the senior military officer stationed there. The authorities immediately issued orders to their subordinates to earnestly protect foreigners and to instruct the people to endure humiliation and bear the burden, and not to act rashly on emotion. After Nakano was injured that day, his son (about twenty years old, currently studying at Hepu Middle School) urgently hired Dr. Wu Shigui from the French hospital to treat him, but due to the severity of his injuries, he died soon after. After this unfortunate incident occurred, Beihai merchants were deeply afraid of diplomatic negotiations, so they suspended business and transported their inventory out of the port to ensure safety. Later, through the military and police's forceful suppression and encouragement to do business with peace of mind and not to disturb themselves, the hearts of the people in Beihai have only slightly calmed down in recent days.

<h3>Kunshan: A Ginkgo Tree Emits Strange Light at Midnight</h3>
<p>Behind the Samsungtan near Zhangpu Town in the sixth district of the county, there is a huge ginkgo tree, several *zhang* high, with a long history. Every summer and autumn, it blooms and bears fruit. According to local residents, starting on the 24th of last month, the top of the tree has emitted strange, colorful light every midnight, and it has not stopped yet. As a result, the news has spread far and wide, and people are marveling at it. The general villagers are extremely alarmed and plan to collect money to build a temple there, which is foolish indeed.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: County Government Arrests Opium Smokers</h3>
<p>County Magistrate Deng believes that there are more than 2,400 opium smokers in the county who have failed to appear for questioning. He issued summonses some days ago, but they still did not appear. Therefore, he ordered the Public Security Bureau to carry out named arrests. On October 1, a total of 108 opium smokers who failed to appear were arrested and sent to the county government yesterday (the 11th) for detention, pending investigation. Arrests continued yesterday, and more than 100 more people were arrested. However, many are avoiding arrest out of fear of punishment. The county government is determined to rigorously pursue them in order to strengthen the prohibition policy.</p>
<h3>Business and Industry Compete to Be National Representatives</h3>
<p>The Wu County professional organizations are electing national representatives. The business community held a vote at Zhongshan Hall starting at 8:00 AM on the 11th. As there are a total of 82 trade associations in the county, and there are more than 800 voters, the vote will be held over two days. However, businessmen are competing fiercely for this national election. The candidates are Cheng Ganqing and Zhang Shoupeng. Both have considerable prestige and influence in the business community of Suzhou. The Chamber of Commerce has set up a rest area in the Yuandu Fangzhang near Zhongshan Hall, while Zhang Shoupeng has set up a rest area in the Leizu Temple, each providing lunch to entertain the voters. Yesterday, more than forty trade associations voted, and the rest must vote today. The labor unions will vote today (the 12th) at the county government. The ballot boxes will be sent to the Wuxi Second District Election Office on the 13th, and the votes will be counted in Wuxi on the 14th.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: A Young Woman Commits Suicide Out of Shame and Indignation</h3>
<p>Yun Ronggen, a resident of Dongda Street in the city, is a water worker by trade. He married a Ms. Ma and has two sons and a daughter. The daughter, named Wenxiu, is twenty years old and skilled in embroidery. She usually stays at home and observes propriety. She is engaged to Zhu Bingqing of Lianyuan Street and will marry in the winter. Chen Jiasu (also known as Ah Qi), the young master of the Wanan Pawnshop next door, falsely accused Wenxiu of having an affair with the young master of a certain money shop and falsely obtained two yuan in legal tender from Yun Ronggen in the name of it. Ronggen returned home and rebuked Wenxiu. Unexpectedly, Wenxiu, feeling compelled and helpless, secretly took opium and committed suicide the previous morning (the 10th). Rescue efforts were ineffective, and she died around 3:00 PM. Afterwards, the local Public Security Bureau and the local court sent personnel to investigate the case in order to handle it according to the law.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: A Seventy-Year-Old Woman Dies of Indignation</h3>
<p>Wei Zhongyuan, a villager in Weijiadang, Zhongzha Town, Fifth District of Jiangdu, was reported by the local community leader, Shi Dequan, last year for writing threatening letters demanding money. He was arrested and sent to the court and sentenced to six months in prison. Now that he has completed his sentence and returned, his elder brother, Zhongyou, encountered Shi's father, Dayuan, on the road, and they had an argument. They argued all the way to Shi's house. Shi then went to the town office and reported that Zhong destroyed the stove and said that 32 yuan in legal tender and a small lock in the cabinet were missing. The town office prepared a document and sent Wei Zhongyou to the district office, and after questioning, he was sent to the county. Now Wei's mother (about seventy years old) is grieving that her son has been repeatedly accused and detained by the Shi family. On the night of the 8th, she went to the Shi family to explain, but she was so anxious that she collapsed and died in the Shi family's house. The Shi family was shocked at the sight and fled. When Wei's mother's family heard the news, they gathered more than a hundred women from the clan and drove to the Shi family to reason with them. It is not yet known how it will end.</p>
<h3>Haizhou: Child Air Defense Drill Held</h3>
<p>The Longhai Railway Protection Team has been conducting air defense drills at Lianyungang Station and the wharves for days. When the locomotive emergency release and the ticket office bell kept ringing, pedestrians on the road were cut off. At 5:00 PM this afternoon (the 9th), another air defense drill was held. The Railway Protection Team deployed posts at important intersections. At the same time, stretcher teams and rescue teams set off together. The drill lasted for several tens of minutes until the locomotive was released again, and traffic was restored.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Agricultural Warehouse Loans Offered</h3>
<p>The Hangzhou Branch of the Farmers Bank of China, in order to quickly implement agricultural warehouse loans due to the abundant autumn harvest in Zhejiang Province this year, has directed the Lingjiaqiao Farmers' Cooperative Union in Hang County to set up twenty small-scale warehouses and provide loans of 100,000 yuan. It has also established a cotton warehouse in Wubao, Hangzhou City, and provided loans of more than 5,900 yuan. It also plans to guide the establishment of a joint warehouse in Anji to handle agricultural product loans of 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. Recently, the head office in Hankou sent an investigator to Zhejiang, accompanied by Xiao Juefei, a rural work specialist, to inspect the rural situation in Hangzhou City and County, as well as Jinhua and Lanxi. He will return to Hankou to report in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Jiashan First District Occupational Election Vote Count</h3>
<p>The occupational elections in the first district, one city, and twelve counties were completed on the 8th. The ballot boxes from the chambers of commerce, farmers' associations, and labor unions in each county were sent to the Jiashan First District Election Office on the 9th. The vote count was divided into groups on the 10th and 11th in Zhongshan Hall. The results for the chambers of commerce were Zhou Yangsong, Chen Qinshi, Jin Runquan, and Wang Wenhan, who received the most votes. For the farmers' associations, Jin Yueguang, Yang Ming, Jiang Qingyun, and Sun Yuwan received the most votes.</p>
<h3>Bengbu: Entertainers Request Reduction in Singing Tax</h3>
<p>The entertainers in this port, originally called prostitutes, used to pay a singing tax of six yuan per month to the Public Security Bureau. Later, a military surcharge of four yuan was added, totaling ten yuan per month. After the Public Security Bureau abolished the tax collection office, this tax was collected by the Fengyang Business Tax Bureau. Now, the entertainer representative, Li Xiaoting, and others argue that, due to the current economic downturn and declining entertainment, the monthly tax of ten yuan for entertainers is truly beyond their means. They have specially petitioned the Anhui Finance Department to order the cancellation of the additional four yuan and to divide the singing tax into three levels of two yuan, four yuan, and six yuan in order to lighten the burden. It is not known whether this will be approved.</p>

<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Supervises the Summoning of Factory Owners; Explains the True Meaning of Labor-Management Coordination; Bureau Director Pan, Section Chief Xu, and Others Deliver Speeches; Hope Both Parties Will Cooperate and Share the Burdens Together</h3>
<p>According to the *Xin Sheng She*, in accordance with the resolutions of the recent joint Party-Government meeting, in order to eliminate labor unrest, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, together with the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Public Security Bureau, summoned the owners of silk factories, cotton mills, and silk weaving factories to the bureau yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM to discuss and explain the true meaning of labor-management coordination. More than twenty people attended, including Qi Yiwen of Yong'an Textile Factories 1, 2, 3, and 5, Li Xizhao, Hua Jianren of Shenxin Factories 1, 6, 8, and 9, and Zhang Peishen of Xiangcheng Heki Silk Factory. Xu Yefu, the chief of the third section of the bureau, presided over the meeting. After reporting the significance of convening the discussion meeting, he said that the occurrence of labor unrest is enough to affect governance and security, and how to prevent it in advance is appropriate. Although government agencies are responsible, industrial and commercial enterprises should also assist the government for their own interests, so that labor unrest can be eliminated in the bud.</p>
<p>Points to note:</p>
<p>1. If a factory is forced to close or suspend work for more than one month, regardless of whether the reason is due to reorganization or financial difficulties, it should be reported in advance.</p>
<p>2. If it is necessary to reduce a portion of workers due to cost-cutting, or if workers' performance is truly poor and they must be dismissed, it should be reported in advance.</p>
<p>3. Reducing wages is an unavoidable measure to maintain business during this period of weak purchasing power, but this move is most likely to cause disputes and should be reported in advance.</p>
<p>4. There is no problem with increasing working hours while simultaneously increasing wages, but some workers may be unwilling to work excessively due to limited physical strength. Moreover, increasing working hours without increasing wages will naturally lead to disputes, so if it is unavoidable to increase working hours, it should be reported in advance.</p>
<p>In short, all of the above are points to note. Any event that could cause a labor-management dispute must be reported at any time so that government agencies can have the opportunity to mediate in advance, so that various disputes can be reduced from large to small, and from existence to non-existence. Then, mediation director Wang Xianqing delivered a speech, saying that in order to achieve labor-management coordination, both spiritual and material aspects must be taken into account. Materially, such as improving treatment, etc., in this era of economic downturn, the factory may not be able to bear the burden in reality, so let's set that aside for now. As for the spiritual aspect, if the factory can deal with it properly, it can also reduce many unnecessary disputes. For example, the recent dispute at the Hongxing Sock Factory was only a verbal conflict between workers, but it caused the entire factory to stop. Fortunately, all those present are experienced and should be able to understand that the factory should treat the workers as parents in a leadership and protective role, and that passionate emotions should be deeply rooted in the lower levels, so that the spiritual and material aspects can be combined, sharing weal and woe, cooperating sincerely, and there is nothing to fear.</p>
<p>Bureau Director's Speech:</p>
<p>Finally, Bureau Director Pan delivered a speech, saying that Section Chief Xu has already conveyed the significance of convening the discussion meeting today, and everyone should understand it. Recently, the situation is tense, and all those who pay attention to the international environment are worried about the occurrence of unexpected events. Although the government is responsible for this responsibility, all sectors should work together. For example, if industrial and commercial affairs are handled improperly, it may also affect security. Especially in factories with a large number of workers, even if a small number of people stir up trouble, it can cause extreme disputes. Some factory workers have labor union organizations, while others do not. Those with organizations have the Party Headquarters to lead them, while those without organizations are easily exploited. Recently, some secret organizations have taken advantage of the opportunity to incite labor unrest in the name of saving the country. Industries such as silk factories, cotton mills, and silk weaving factories have a large number of workers, and once there is an opportunity, they will instigate them from the middle, creating a confrontational situation and using this as a pretext to cause trouble. Although military and police agencies are responsible for local security, this bureau hopes for labor-management coordination to reduce disputes, which can also maintain security. The three industries of silk factories, cotton mills, and silk weaving factories that have been convened today have many workers who are like a heap of loose sand. In addition to discussing with the Party Headquarters and the persons in charge of the labor movement to find ways to have representatives lead these workers, persuade them with reason, and explain the importance of the overall situation, it is hoped that each factory can also be mindful of the current difficulties, labor-management coordination, and cooperation. If there is a problem, it is hoped that it will be handled fairly so that disputes do not easily occur. If there is a fear that a dispute may occur, it is hoped that each factory will report to this bureau at any time, and we will do our best to persuade and find ways to quell it. I believe that everyone is concerned about the decline of the country's status and that, in order to seek the smooth development of their businesses, there is no hope of causing trouble to affect security. Any dispute that is not easily resolved is not due to the factory and the workers themselves, but often there is a third party involved with ulterior motives, attempting to disrupt order. Recently, a certain tabloid supplement had an article saying how difficult the lives of silk weaving factory workers are. This kind of talk, which does not understand the truth, is due to a lack of careful consideration. This bureau welcomes everyone to give advice at any time and hopes to communicate news at any time to assist the government in safely weathering this difficult environment so that it is not destroyed by others. After the speech, factory representatives such as Li Xizhao and Zhang Peishen contributed their opinions and then dispersed.</p>
<h3>General Labor Union Issues Order; Trade Unions Warn Workers Not to Strike or Slow Down; Implement Labor-Management Coordination; Disputes Will Be Mediated According to Law</h3>
<p>The Municipal General Labor Union issued General Order No. 6 yesterday, stating: In order to comply with the order, our country has been affected by the global economic downturn for years. Rural areas are bankrupt, and industry and commerce are declining. In addition, disasters are frequent, and people's purchasing power is declining. If we do not urgently seek remedies, the consequences are unthinkable. The union has repeatedly issued orders urging labor-management coordination, hoping to turn the tide. However, labor unrest in the city has been fluctuating and unstable in recent days, and the future is worrying. In addition to separately submitting reports to Party and government agencies, ordering each factory not to stop work, reduce wages, or dismiss workers at will, and sincerely advising employers in various industries, we hereby reiterate the previous order and earnestly explain that if an accident occurs, they should immediately request mediation according to law and not lightly strike or slow down work, lest they incur blame. The union has high hopes for this. This order is issued on September 11, 1936, by Chairman Zhu Xuefan and Standing Committee Members Zhou Xuexiang, Shao Xubai, Zhang Kechang, Long Peiyun, Li Mengnan, and Ye Xianggao.</p>
<h3>Finance Minister Kong Observes Birthday; Forgoes Customs and Avoids Congratulations</h3>

<h3>American Ambassador Scheduled to Go South; Embassy in Nanjing Has Moved to New Location</h3>
<p>According to the *Xin Sheng She*, the American Consulate-General reported yesterday that the US Embassy's rented Xinhua Bank building in Nanjing has been completed, and all staff members, including Counselor Cooke, have moved into the new location. Ambassador Johnson is scheduled to go south on October 1 and will likely stay in Nanjing for an extended period. However, the Embassy in Beijing will continue to exist. Johnson will likely spend seven or eight months in Nanjing each year and four or five months in Beijing. Assistant American Consul-General Stanton also said that the new location of the embassy in Nanjing was originally intended to be self-built, but there was no suitable location, and due to funding issues, it was unlikely to be approved by Congress, so it was rented. Fortunately, there were contacts regarding the Xinhua Bank building before construction, and the US Embassy participated in the engineering aspects. There are five buildings, one for the Ambassador's residence, one for the Ambassador's office, one for the Counselor's office, and the remaining two for the Secretariat, which is sufficient for use.</p>

The central government has dealt with the financial situation in a very capable manner. When asked about the current commercial situation in Shanghai, Mr. Hart replied that there are signs of prosperity and that the future of Chinese commerce is very bright. There is currently nothing to be concerned about. Of course, there are many rumors circulating, claiming that the central government will take over certain types of businesses and establish monopolies, etc. This move would not be beneficial.

<h3>Party and National Flag Uniform Promotion Committee Decided to End Yesterday; Promotion Difficulties, Poor Results; Donation Request for Birthday Celebrations to be Reduced</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Party and National Flag Uniform Promotion Committee held a closing meeting the other day on the ninth floor of the YMCA. Chairman Li Dachao reported on the promotion process, first mentioning that the Manufacturing and Sales Bureau sent a letter to the committee purchasing aircraft for birthday celebrations, voluntarily offering 15% of the total sales revenue in Shanghai as a donation to promote the flag initiative. He stated that the initial progress was quite difficult, but they continued to work hard to promote the flag initiative. The assistance from the Public Security Bureau was most helpful in promoting the initiative, especially in the urban areas. When the National Revolutionary Army Northern Expedition Oath-Taking Anniversary was held on September 7th, the national flags hung on various streets were very neatly arranged, which was the most spectacular scene since the Northern Expedition. In rural areas, many poor households were unwilling to purchase flags, and promotion staff did not force them to do so. Some schools and organizations did not have flags prepared. The water patrol team started relatively smoothly, but the results were not good. The Manufacturing and Sales Bureau handled the initiative independently in the special district, and the results were also poor. A total of 95,521.82 yuan was sold. According to the 15% donation rate, over 14,000 yuan should be donated. Currently, the bureau has already donated 5,000 yuan to those purchasing aircraft for birthday celebrations. Then, Chen Chaojun, a representative from the Party and National Flag Manufacturing and Sales Bureau, reported on the bureau's expenses and requested a reduction in the donation for purchasing aircraft for birthday celebrations. The following proposals were then discussed: (1) The party and national flag promotion work in this city has been largely completed, and the committee can be closed soon. It was resolved that the committee would be closed immediately and reported to party and government agencies. (2) Where should the committee's files and documents be transferred? It was resolved that they should be transferred to the municipal government. (3) The promotion work of the water patrol team and in the special district has not yet been completed. How should it be handled? It was resolved that the water patrol team's promotion work could be closed immediately, and the party and national flag promotion work in the special district would be handled by the Manufacturing and Sales Bureau. (4) How should the donation for purchasing aircraft for birthday celebrations be settled? It was resolved that representatives from the municipal party committee, municipal public security bureau, municipal chamber of commerce, and the committee purchasing aircraft for birthday celebrations should be invited to liaise with the Party and National Flag Manufacturing and Sales Bureau for settlement. The committee purchasing aircraft for birthday celebrations has already announced that it will be closed on the 10th of this month.</p>

<h3>Yao Xijiu Returns to Shanghai and Talks About Handing Over the Aviation Association; Shanghai Branch of the Aviation Construction Association to be Established Soon; One Million Yuan to be Paid First for Aircraft Purchase Donations</h3>
<p>The Chinese Aviation Association was ordered to merge, and after convening a meeting of the executive directors, it was decided to complete the handover at the end of this month and send concurrently Secretary-General Yao Xijiu to Nanjing to liaise with the National Aviation Construction Association regarding the handover and the establishment of a Shanghai branch. He returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. According to reports, the Shanghai branch will be established immediately after the handover of the general association, and the work of various departments will not be interrupted. Donations for purchasing aircraft for birthday celebrations will also continue. The following is a record of Yao's remarks:</p>
<p>Consolidating Construction Through the Merger of Two Associations</p>
<p>Yao stated that the Chinese Aviation Association has been established for nearly four years and has been concentrating the power of the people of the country to assist the government in building air defense. At the same time, the government also has the National Aviation Construction Association, which is a committee for planning and constructing aviation. Recently, in order to concentrate authority and strengthen forces, the two associations have been merged into the National Aviation Construction Association, with the general association located in the capital and branches established in various provinces and cities throughout the country. The general association has hired more than 40 prominent figures from all walks of life as members, and Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan, and four others as standing committee members, with Zhou Zhirou as the director-general. It has now begun operations. Branches that have already been established in various provinces will continue to operate, and those that have not been established will be actively guided to prepare for establishment.</p>
<p>Shanghai Association to Continue Work After Establishment</p>
<p>The Chinese Aviation Association was ordered to close and is scheduled to be completed by the end of this month. I was sent to Nanjing to liaise with the general association. At that time, Director-General Zhou Zhirou will personally come to Shanghai to take over. As for the Shanghai branch, we will continue to be responsible for it. Therefore, there is a proposal to re-appoint Wu Tiecheng as the chairman and Lin Kanghou, Wang Xiaoxiang, and others as members. At that time, in addition to transferring the affairs of the already established branches in Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Fujian, Hunan, Jiangsu, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Henan, and other provinces to the general association for handling, the Shanghai part of the affairs will be continued by the branch and will not be interrupted. For example, the Aviation Semi-Monthly, because it is the only aviation publication in the country, is quite popular among people at home and abroad, with direct subscriptions reaching more than 5,000 copies. As for the flight training class, it has been earnestly trained with excellent results. After the first phase graduates this winter, it will continue to operate.</p>
<p>Aircraft Purchase Donations Planned for Initial Payment</p>
<p>For Chairman Chiang's 50th birthday this year, various sectors initiated the purchase of aircraft to celebrate his birthday. A committee was established in this city to handle donations. This city pledged to donate one million yuan. Telegrams from various provinces pledged donations, totaling more than four million yuan including the city's contribution. They are now being paid in succession. In order to concentrate operations, the various sectors in the capital established the Chiang Kai-shek Birthday Aircraft Donation Commemoration Committee to concentrate national donations, plan to order aircraft, and prepare for the aircraft donation ceremony. Now that Chairman Chiang's birthday is approaching, in order to assess the donation results in various regions, he ordered each donation point to report and pay first. The Chinese Aviation Association also raised the issue for discussion at the previous executive director's meeting and decided to make a settlement at the end of this month, pay one million yuan of the collected money first, and then continue to collect the remaining unpaid money and continue to solicit donations.</p>
<h3>Mr. Lan Lakos Xi Succeeds as Spanish Consul General in Shanghai; Spanish Government Officially Appointed</h3>
<p>The Shen Shi News Agency reports that Mr. Fuli, the Spanish Consul General in Shanghai, submitted his resignation to the Madrid government earlier this month due to dissatisfaction with the government's policies.

<h3>Agricultural Loan Syndicate Regulations: Measures for Cotton Transport and Sales Loans</h3>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reports that the China Agricultural Loan Syndicate has allocated 1.4 million yuan to handle cotton transport and sales loans for Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hebei, and other three provinces in the Republic of China in 1936. The current loan measures are handled in accordance with the measures set by the cotton production improvement office of the Central Cotton Production Improvement Institute. The measures are recorded as follows: "Because cooperatives lack funds themselves, the initial working capital required for the cotton that is pre-paid at 70% of the flower price, i.e., the cotton that is cooperatively transported and sold, and the cotton that is purchased from members with full payment, averages 4,000 yuan per cooperative, totaling approximately 60,000 yuan. Borrow from the syndicate with the average share capital of each cooperative, approximately 1,000 yuan, deposited in the syndicate as collateral for losses. The flower payment should be made according to the prescribed standards, and the improvement institute is responsible for and supervises the handling. The aforementioned borrowed working capital must be deducted in full when the business is nearing completion, and it is estimated that the price obtained from the sale of cotton from each cooperative is sufficient to repay the principal and interest of the loan, in order to prepare for returning it to the syndicate. At the same time, the instructors of each cooperative must report the number of flowers nearing the end of the season in their respective locations, so that the branch offices can be prepared for the aforementioned calculation."</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Literature Exhibition Establishes Shanghai Solicitation Branch; Ye Yuhu and Zhang Yongni are Appointed as Directors; Hangzhou Decides to Open on October 26</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Library was established by the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education to host the Zhejiang Literature Exhibition, and the library is in charge of the event. A design committee was formed to prepare for various aspects. The previous report was recorded. It is now known that the Shanghai design committee, with the exhibition approaching, and taking advantage of the visit of Chen Xunci, curator of the Provincial Library, to Shanghai, held a Shanghai Micro-Product Branch establishment meeting at the Ningbo Fellow Association on Tibet Road yesterday (the 11th) evening at 7:00 PM.

Ye Yuhu was elected as the chairman. Chen Xunci, curator of the library, reported on the preparation process of the association and the solicitation of products from various branches. Then, the discussion began, and the following key issues were decided: (1) Ye Yuhu was elected as the director, and Zhang Yongni and Qin Runqing were elected as deputy directors. (2) The Fukuyuan Money Shop on Ningbo Road was designated as the communication and collection point for the branch (the shop has a storage vault, and Qin is the manager). (3) The Shanghai solicitation period was set from September 20 to October 15. The collection point will issue official receipts at any time. The Zhejiang Library will send staff to collect them at that time. (4) Each party should solicit books and materials, and can obtain methods and solicitation forms from the shop. In addition, discussions were held on storage safety, display methods, and contact with collectors. The results were very satisfactory. It is reported that the branch offices in Beijing, Ping, Ningbo, Shaoxing, Jiaxing, and Huzhou have all been established and are in progress. The standing committee also decided that the Double Ten period was too short, and decided to open the event on October 26 at the library in Hangzhou.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests Ministry of Finance to Levy Tax on Privately Refined Kerosene</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a memorial to the Ministry of Finance yesterday, requesting action on the matter. On the 10th of this month, the Petroleum Industry Association sent a letter stating that since the import tax on kerosene has been increased several times, it has reached 4.6 yuan per pair (i.e., ten gallons) in national currency. Cunning merchants in various places are competing to refine kerosene from diesel to avoid heavy taxes. This has been going on for several years. In order to prevent tax evasion, the customs has revised the diesel tax regulations to remedy the situation and clearly stipulated that any oil refinery must be approved by the local officials and reported to the customs for approval and assignment of personnel to monitor and collect taxes. The legislation to protect legitimate merchants and prevent tax evasion is very thorough. Unexpectedly, since last year, the number of oil refineries has been increasing, all refining with low-grade diesel, cleverly evading customs duties as before. The products are flooding the market, prices have plummeted, and the losses of all imported kerosene are countless. The government's treatment of oil merchants must be equal, and kerosene and diesel are not domestically produced. If clever tax evasion is allowed to continue, how can the national treasury be valued and fairness be shown? For the sake of the present, the Ministry should forward the matter to the Ministry of Finance to exempt all of the heavy import tax on kerosene, so that cunning people will have no means to use their skills, and the burden can be reduced in today's collapsed rural economy. If it is difficult to implement due to public debt funds, the Ministry should also consult with the provincial and municipal governments to order the police to strictly investigate privately established refineries and order them to report to the government for approval in accordance with the customs regulations, and assign personnel to monitor and collect taxes, similar to the cigarette factory method, which will surely increase annual revenue. If none of the above measures are adopted, imported oil merchants will be in imminent danger and will have to change their industries and engage in oil refining, which will completely eliminate the customs duties of more than 50 million yuan. The association serves the people and is heartbroken that domestic kerosene has not yet been exploited, and the sale of foreign goods is painful. However, the amount of regular tax paid over the years is more than millions, and they have never complained about serving the country. However, with the rampant private oil and the government indifferent, business is declining and bankruptcy is imminent. They have to make a sincere statement. They dare to ask the Chamber to forward the matter to the Ministry of Finance and promptly take strict measures to punish evasion and show fairness. The committee is awaiting orders. After investigating, the establishment of factories by Chinese to refine kerosene from diesel is also a strategy of changing semi-finished products into refined products and reducing leakage. However, once the import tax on diesel is paid, it can be refined without paying any more taxes. The difference between tax-exempt and taxable kerosene is too great. Since there is a door for evasion, it does not seem fair. The association requests that the factories that refine kerosene from diesel be subject to a balanced tax rate, similar to the cigarette factories, and a unified tax be collected, so that manufacturers can still make a profit, and the national tax revenue and the oil merchants' business can be preserved. It seems to be a well-considered and comprehensive strategy, and it is reasonable to request the Ministry to review and approve it for implementation. It is convenient for the public.</p>
<h3>Du Yuesheng of the Gaoqiao Rural Improvement Association Requests Repair of Ponds; Seawater Will Connect with Fields; Prevention of Mid-Autumn Tide Disaster is Necessary</h3>
<p>The Gaoqiao seawall in Pudong, this city, is extremely thin, and after being violently impacted by the strong wind and rain on the 3rd of this month, several places suddenly collapsed, and the situation is extremely serious. Fortunately, the wind direction changed that night, and the situation was temporarily relieved, but the autumn floods are approaching in the blink of an eye, and the future is truly worrying. The Gaoqiao Rural Improvement Association specifically requested the Municipal Public Works Bureau by letter from President Du Yuesheng to prepare a solution as soon as possible to avoid danger. The original letter is recorded below. Respected Sirs: The Pudong seawall extends for more than twenty li from the mouth of the Wusong River to the Daijiazhai section, protecting millions of people in our Pudong area. However, the water is rapid and the seawall is thin, impacting each other, and there is always concern about collapse. The devastating events of 1933 still frighten the people. Who would have known that since the beginning of autumn, the sea level has risen and hurricanes have occurred repeatedly. From the Jiazhai section of the Gaoqiao District ShuiTian Huangjiazhai seawall, which is three miles long, it is felt that it is not safe from one morning to the next, and the situation is extremely dangerous. After the storm tide on the 3rd of this month, the seawall was further shaken. The Longwang Temple at the Daijiazhai Seaside Bathing Beach and the four places in Jiazhai section of the Gaoqiao District ShuiTian Huangjiazhai have been washed into breaches, and the seawater outside the seawall will be connected to the fields inside the seawall. If it is struck by another storm tide, the flood will flow back and become a waterlogged country. What's more, the Mid-Autumn Festival tide is imminent. Alas, my people, worried that they will live with fish and turtles, are in great sorrow day and night, not knowing what to do. If we do not take measures to repair it as soon as possible, the great disaster is at hand. I have seen this and respectfully list the dangerous situation and respectfully ask your Bureau to investigate the facts and instruct the local authorities to quickly engage in dike construction and rescue to relieve the crisis and reassure the people. I hope you will approve and adopt it. The gratitude of the people is not only mine.</p>
<h3>Full Text of the Du Chongyuan Case Verdict: Supreme Court Explains Reasons in Detail; Sentence Changed Regarding Confiscation</h3>
<p>Following the two trials of Mr. Du Chongyuan, the person in charge of *New Life Weekly*, Mrs. Hou Yuzhi, Mr. Du's wife, disagreed and independently appealed. Lawyers Yu Zhong and Luo drafted the appeal. The Supreme Court has now issued its verdict. The full text is recorded below:</p>
<p>(Year 25, Shang Zi No. 832) Appellant Hou Yuzhi, female, wife of Du Chongyuan, age 29, resident of No. 52, Xinyu Lane, Meibai Road, Shanghai. Defendant Du Chongyuan, male, age 39, engaged in industry, resident of *New Life Weekly* office, Fuxing Lane, Sima Road, Shanghai. The above-named appellant filed an appeal against the first instance verdict issued by the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court on July 9th, Republic of China Year 24, in the case of the defendant's offense against international relations. This court's verdict is as follows:</p>
<p>Main Text</p>
<p>The portion of the original verdict concerning the conviction and sentence is revoked. Du Chongyuan is sentenced to imprisonment for one year and two months for disseminating writings and jointly defaming the head of a friendly nation.</p>
<p>Reasons</p>
<p>The appellant's appeal raises approximately three points, namely: (1) Whether the appeal should be accepted; (2) Whether the conditions for prosecution are met; (3) Whether criminal liability exists. Regarding the first point, the issue of appeal has already been decided by this court on September 11th of last year, with a ruling to accept the appeal, so further explanation is unnecessary. As for the second point, it states that Article 119 of the Criminal Code stipulates that offenses against reputation under Article 116 and offenses under Article 118 require a request from the foreign government for prosecution. The method of making such a request is also clearly stipulated in Article 220, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law (which is a mistake; it should be Article 222, Paragraph 1). Now, upon examining the facts stated in the original verdict and the original indictment, this case was initiated solely by a request from the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai to the Shanghai Municipal Government, which then ordered the Public Security Bureau to forward the investigation and prosecution. Since the Consul-General in Shanghai cannot be considered the representative of the foreign government, and the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Public Security Bureau cannot consider themselves the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the highest judicial administrative authority, both the requester and the recipient of the request are unqualified. Therefore, the request cannot be considered legal, and the conditions for prosecution are still lacking. The prosecutor's indictment based on this is an improper acceptance of the case. The third point states that *New Life Weekly*, Volume 2, Issue 15, was published on May 4th of this year (Year 24), while Du Chongyuan was staying in Jiangxi before that date. The letter from the Jiangxi Pottery Management Bureau has been presented as evidence, sufficient to prove that Du Chongyuan did not participate in or know about the publication and distribution of "Gossip Emperor." The original trial did not investigate in detail whether the author "Yishui," who signed the article, was another person, or whether the manuscript had actually been reviewed by Du Chongyuan. Instead, it simply considered that Du Chongyuan, as the editor and publisher, was legally responsible, which shows a lack of thoroughness in the trial. Furthermore, since the author of "Gossip Emperor," Yishui, is someone else, the original intention of the author, whether it contained defamatory intent, could not be speculated by Du Chongyuan, who was unaware. However, if the allegedly defamatory statement is supported by substantial evidence based on objective facts, sufficient to show that it is not entirely without basis, and does not involve private morality, Article 310, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Code still provides an explicit exemption from punishment. In monarchical states, the ideology of the emperor's position varies significantly with the era and culture, with major differences in the so-called divine right theory, patriarchal theory, property theory, and state organ theory. In Japan, since the Meiji and Taisho eras, constitutional scholars in that country have centered their discussions on the organ theory and the subject theory. Therefore, the description of the Japanese Emperor in "Gossip Emperor" has a basis in academic theory and cannot be regarded as a defamatory intention. Moreover, "Gossip Emperor" does not exclusively target the monarch of Japan for gossip. It does not contain a factual infringement on the Japanese Emperor's personality, and at most, it only states that the Emperor's authority is gradually declining. Since it does not harm the general reputation of being an emperor, it is unlikely to harm the Japanese Emperor's personality. It is therefore difficult to say that the author has legally fulfilled the general requirements for the crime of defamation. In addition to the improper distinction regarding the existence of criminal liability, the application of the sentencing provisions cannot be said to be free of error. This court believes that the crime of defamation under Article 310, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code is committed merely by disseminating writings or drawings to point out or spread facts sufficient to damage the reputation of others. It does not require that the reputation of the person being defamed actually be damaged as a necessary element. As for whether those facts are sufficient to damage reputation, it is naturally interpreted that the position of the person being defamed should be concretely observed, and the standard of judgment cannot be based on general abstract views. (The provisions of Article 325, Paragraph 2 of the old Criminal Code are the same.) After examining *New Life Weekly*, Volume 2, Issue 15, submitted by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, the article "Gossip Emperor," signed by Yishui, states: "As far as we know, the Emperor of Japan is a biologist. He has to be the Emperor because of hereditary succession. Everything is done in the name of the Emperor, but in fact, he has no say. The Emperor is used when receiving foreign guests, when reviewing troops, and when holding grand ceremonies. Otherwise, the Emperor is forgotten by the people. The Japanese military and the bourgeoisie are the true rulers of Japan... At present, Japan is reluctant to abandon this antique called the Emperor, which is of great help to the current stage of Japanese rule. It tries to use the Emperor to ease the conflicts between all internal classes and to cover up the crimes of some people... Japan elevates the Emperor to be inviolable, but in fact, he is also a puppet of the modern true rulers." These words not only contain insulting language towards the head of a friendly nation but also point out facts sufficient to damage the dignity of his position. It is in line with the constituent elements of the crime of defamation. The appellant's argument that the essay does not exclusively target the monarch of Japan and does not contain any factual infringement on the Emperor's personality and does not constitute defamation is an abnormal view. Although the appellant also submitted writings by Japanese constitutional scholars, stating that there are still debates among scholars in that country regarding the Emperor's constitutional position, and that the content of the essay is not entirely without basis, claiming that it meets the exemption conditions of Article 310, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Code, it is not known that the provision is only exempt from punishment if the defamed matter can be proven to be true. The writings of Japanese scholars submitted by the appellant are purely academic discussions and are not related to the content of the preceding essay. They cannot prove that the matters pointed out in the original text are true. How can they be used as an argument for exemption? As the defendant served as the editor and publisher of *New Life Weekly*, he should be responsible for the content of the publication. The defendant himself confessed this during the investigation. Although the article "Gossip Emperor" was published under the name of Yishui, the defendant implemented its publication. Unless there is conclusive proof that he was unaware, he cannot shirk joint responsibility. Although the defendant argued that he was still staying in Jiangxi when the weekly was published and did not participate in Shanghai, he presented a letter from the Jiangxi Pottery Administration sent to his friend Sun Xuxian in Shanghai as evidence. However, it is not necessary for the editor to be present at the place of publication in order to review the text published in the publication. Even if the defendant was not in Shanghai when the publication was published, it is still not enough to refute the accusations against him. The original trial found the defendant responsible for the joint crime of harming the reputation of the head of a friendly nation, and taking into account the impact of the crime, sentenced him to imprisonment for one year and two months, which is legally sound. The appellant's allegations on this point are also clearly untenable. Furthermore, Article 119 of the Criminal Code states that the crime of harming reputation under Article 116 requires a request from the foreign government for prosecution (the provisions of Article 127 of the old Criminal Code are the same). The so-called "request by the foreign government" is not limited to a direct request by the foreign government; it also has the effect of a legal request when the foreign government authorizes its subordinate officials to do so. Furthermore, according to Article 222, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, this request must be made through the Minister of Foreign Affairs consulting the highest judicial administrative authority, and the relevant prosecutor must be notified. However, this is not a required procedure for making the request. Therefore, even if the foreign government's request does not go through the procedures outlined in that article, as long as the expression of the request has reached the relevant prosecutor, it should be considered legal. According to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau's official letter to the prosecutor of the original court in this case, it only stated "Upon receiving a telegram from the Municipal Government stating that the Japanese Consul-General came to the office to request prosecution in accordance with the law." It is unclear whether the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai was ordered by the government to act on its behalf. However, the Third Instance Court may investigate the facts in accordance with Article 386 of the Criminal Procedure Law regarding whether the original trial accepted the lawsuit. This court has obtained an official letter from the Shanghai Municipal Government to the prosecutor of the original court, which vaguely states, "In this case, the Japanese Consul-General was ordered by his government to personally come to the office to request legal action." It is beyond doubt that he was ordered to act on his behalf. The expression of this request has also reached the relevant prosecutor, and the conditions for prosecution are complete. The original trial's acceptance of the lawsuit was not improper. The appellant's accusation that the request was made by the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai to the Shanghai Municipal Government, which ordered the Public Security Bureau to forward the investigation, is a misunderstanding. However, Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code states, "If the law changes after the act, the law in force at the time of the judgment shall apply. However, if the law in force before the judgment is more beneficial to the actor, the most beneficial law to the actor shall apply." This refers to comparing the laws in force before the judgment as a whole and applying the one that is most beneficial to the actor. It is not possible to selectively apply the beneficial parts. The defendant committed the crime before the Criminal Code came into effect. According to the law in force before the judgment, he committed the crimes under Articles 42, 122, and 325, Paragraph 2 of the old Criminal Code. The most severe principal penalty under that article is imprisonment for one year or less. After increasing it by one-third, it is imprisonment for one year and four months. Comparing it with the penalty at the time of the judgment, that is, the penalty under Articles 28, 116, and 310, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code, the old Criminal Code is lighter. It is legal to apply the old law as a whole for sentencing. The original verdict only applied the provisions of Article 325, Paragraph 2 of the old Criminal Code for the principal penalty for the crime of defamation. The remaining legal provisions still followed the new law, which is a mistake. Furthermore, only items belonging to the offender and used for the commission of the crime can be confiscated. Article 38, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Code and the latter part of Article 62, Paragraph 1 of the old Criminal Code clearly stipulate this. *New Life Weekly*, Volume 2, Issue 15, on file, was transferred by the Shanghai Municipal Government for reference and does not belong to the offender. It is not eligible for confiscation under the law. The original verdict wrongly treated the publication as being used for the commission of the crime and confiscated it. This is not legal and should be revoked and changed by this court in order to correct the error. The appeal is not entirely without merit. The number of days of detention before the judgment is final that are used to offset the term of imprisonment is a matter of execution. According to the precedent of this court, the new law should be applied. According to Article 46 of the Criminal Code, one day should naturally offset one day of imprisonment, without the need to further advise in the main text.</p>
<p>Based on the above conclusion, in accordance with Articles 389 and 390, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Article 2, Paragraph 1 (but not the provision) of the Criminal Code, and Articles 42, 122, 325 Paragraph 2 and 127 of the old Criminal Code, the judgment is as stated in the main text. August 26, Republic of China Year 25, Ninth Criminal Division of the Supreme Court. Presiding Judge Zhang Xiaolin; Judges Sun Lu, Xu Zaofeng, Ouyang Xu, Sun Yuan. This is certified as a true copy of the original. Clerk Long Puji. August 29, Republic of China Year 25.</p>

<h3>Record of the Trial of the Four Major Criminals in the Japanese Sailor Case: Zhu Guisheng Denies Involvement in the Assassination; Claims the Inside Story Can Only Be Known by Asking Chen Enming - Hearing to Continue This Morning -</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Public Security Bureau arrested Zhu Guisheng, Chen Enming, both from Yangzhou, and Jin Daoquan, from Jiangbei, last month. After investigation, it was found that they were related to two major cases: the shooting death of Japanese sailor Hideo Nakayama on Doulean Road on the night of November 9th last year, and the shooting death of Japanese resident Kuangcang Xuan Sheng in Shanghai on July 10th of this year. Zhu and others had confessed that they were instructed by Zhang Shimin (also known as Zhang Yuhua and Zhang Wei), a key criminal arrested in the capital for assassination. Therefore, special detectives were dispatched to Beijing to transfer Zhang to Shanghai for questioning. Later, the Public Concession Police transferred Zhu, Chen, Jin, and Zhang to the First Special District Local Court for investigation. The part concerning Nakayama Hideo has been investigated in court several times. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiao Xiefen and Prosecutor Tang ascended to the First Criminal Court and ordered the four to be brought to court to continue their separate interrogations. Lawyer Ru Baoyi of the Police stated that Zhu, Jin, and Chen were all arrested by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau. If the court needs to know the circumstances of their arrest and how they confessed in the Public Security Bureau, it should inquire with the Shanghai Public Security Bureau. After the Police brought Zhu and others in,</p>
<p>Each Had a Confession.</p>
<p>However, after the Mountain Police investigated, there were many discrepancies between what they said in the Public Security Bureau. Therefore, it seems inappropriate to speculate on which confession is credible. Only what is obtained from the court interrogation today is the most important. Based on their confessions, not only are there major suspicions about the two cases that have already occurred, but there is also an attempt to stage a third case. If, after the court's investigation, it is determined that Zhu and others have no involvement in the Nakayama Hideo case, then they will be sent back to the Public Security Bureau. Conversely, the Police should still</p>
<p>Continue to Investigate.</p>
<p>Also, etc. The court then questioned Zhu Guisheng, who confessed that he came to Shanghai from his native place in Yangzhou in August of the 22nd year (of the Republic). He worked in Pudong. In the New Year's month, he lost his job and returned to his native place. In April of last year, a friend, Sun Wende, wrote to him promising to find him a job, so he brought his family back and lived in Sun's house in Fude Lane, Hed Road. Because Sun's father-in-law was an old friend of mine, Sun kept me there and gave me 30 yuan a month for living expenses. Later, I learned that Sun was a member of Hua Kezhi's gang, and Hua ordered Sun to pay the money. At that time, Sun also said that if Hua</p>
<p>Came to Shanghai from Hong Kong,</p>
<p>He could find a job for me. It was not until October of last year that Sun stopped paying me. Zhang Shimin was acquainted at Sun's house. Chen Enming was a fellow villager. He also came to Shanghai in September of last year to find a job. What I confessed in the Police station that on November 9th of last year, I heard Zhang Shimin instruct Chen Enming in a room at the Haining Inn on Haining Road to beat a Japanese sailor to death, and that the gun was taken by Shi Fengting, etc., is the same as what I confessed in the Public Security Bureau when I was arrested. In fact, on the afternoon of November 9th, I mailed a money order letter back home. Realizing that the mailing procedure was wrong, I left the Haining Inn at 6 PM and went to the North Sichuan Road Post Office. After correcting the procedure, it was past 7 PM. I was waiting for a tram outside the bureau when Chen Enming came from the Haining Inn. According to Chen,</p>
<p>He Had a Relationship</p>
<p>With Chen Mingshu. I used to serve in the detective team, and I inevitably have enemies outside. Later, I sold soil in my native place and was not tolerated by the villagers. I fled to Shanghai. Now I am being harmed by my enemies Shi Jinshan and others, who accuse me of participating in the assassination work of the assassination group organized by Hua and others. Recently, on August 3rd, Hua Kezhi asked Jin Daoquan to invite me to dinner at the Jiande Apartment on North Sichuan Road and made some inducements, but I did not cooperate. Then Chen Enming confessed, saying that he came to Shanghai in September of last year, and initially lived in Zhu Guisheng's house. He met Zhang Shimin at Zhu's house. He asked me</p>
<p>If I was Skilled with Guns.</p>
<p>On November 8th, Zhang invited me to play, so we went to the Haining Inn on Haining Road. Zhang talked to Shi Fengting, but the sound was too soft to be heard. That night, I stayed at the inn. The next day, Zhang brought a small leather suitcase. When he gave the suitcase to Shi, Zhu was also present and told me not to leak it. Later, Zhu went to the post office to correct the postal remittance procedures, and I followed him out, meeting at the tram station in front of the post office. I only told Zhu that Shi Fengting had already gone to do it, but I did not say that Shi had succeeded. I don't know if the sailor was killed by Shi. Recently, according to Shi Jinsheng, Hua Kezhi went to Zhu Guisheng's house on August 2nd of this year and said that the Japanese sailors last year were harmed by Hua and others. This will definitely have</p>
<p>The Same Actions Again.</p>
<p>But when Shi Jinsheng was a bandit in the past, Zhu Guisheng was a detective, and they were enemies of each other. On November 10th of last year, Zhang Shimin saw that I was dressed sparsely and felt cold, so he gave me four yuan to make clothes, not as any reward. Then, Western Inspector Crowter of Diswei Road reported the situation of the investigation of Haining Inn. Zhang Shimin confessed that he did not know Zhu, Chen, and others. Now Zhu and Chen have confessed to seeing me, or maybe they knew me. I am a fellow villager with Hua Kezhi, and I also know Wang Yaqiao. I am suspicious of the assassination case,</p>
<p>I am Really Suspicious,</p>
<p>But I have nothing to do with this case. Unexpectedly, Zhu and Chen's confessions are all implicated. I also heard that there are my fingerprints on the box and the gun. Then people say that both the evidence and the physical evidence are complete. My crime seems to be unavoidable. It's really shocking. I only knew about the killing of Japanese sailors when I was taken to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, so I absolutely never participated in it. It was already five o'clock when Judge Xiao issued an order to postpone the hearing (today) morning. Zhu and the other four were detained.</p>
<h3>Bandit Wang Er Refuses Arrest, Killed by Bullet Wound</h3>
<p>Ni Fusheng and Wang Er, both from Jiangbei, sneaked into the entrance of Hongan Lane on Bazilu around 1:00 PM the day before yesterday, holding a wooden fake pistol, planning to rob a Guangdong woman, Du Renyi, of her purse, which contained five yuan in banknotes. Wang Er took out a gun and warned Ms. Du not to make a sound. Ni Fusheng stepped forward to snatch it. Ms. Du called out "robber" and resisted, and blew her whistle. The thieves panicked and ran away. Cantonese Xu Yishan and Shaoxing Tian Baochang helped to chase them. Wang Er pulled out a fake gun and threatened Xu. They fled to the intersection of Bazilu and Sichuan Road, where Chinese Inspector Zhang Desheng and Feng Chen of the Hongkou Police Station and Chinese Constable No. 1890 arrived after hearing the alarm. Seeing Wang Er holding a pistol and resisting arrest, Chinese Constable No. 1890 fired his gun and knocked him down to arrest him. It was only then that it was known that his pistol was a fake. Ni Fusheng was also subsequently captured and taken to the police station. After questioning, it was learned that Wang Er (also known as Chen Zhengfa) was 32 years old and had previously been sentenced to 15 years for committing a crime. He was released in April of this year. The police chief ordered Wang, who had stolen a car, to be sent to the Patrol Hospital for treatment. He died at 6:00 AM the next morning due to a wound to a vital part. The body was taken to the forensic examination office on Feilun Road. Bandit Ni was escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Lawyer Zhang Shizhu of the Public Works Department explained the case and requested a postponement. Then, the detectives reported the process of arresting the two thieves and presented a fake pistol for inspection. Du Renyi, Xu Yishan, and Tian Baochang also described the situation of being robbed and chased. When Ni Fusheng was questioned, his confession was evasive. Judge Zhong Qing ordered him to be returned to custody and rescheduled the hearing. Tang, a prosecutor from the court, went to the Wang Er's office and determined that Wang Er, the deceased, had been shot to death by Chinese Constable No. 1890 for robbery and resisting arrest. There was no family to claim the body, so the body was handed over to Pushan Villa for collection. Co-offender Ni Fusheng has also been prosecuted by the police station.</p>
<h3>Detailed Account of the Discovery of Two Nude Corpses, Male and Female, at a Hongkou Women's Hospital; Female Suspect Liang Meiyu Fled Before Arrest; Corpses' Faces Unrecognizable, Apparently Strangled; Female Servant Fei Wangshi Temporarily Detained for Testimony</h3>
<p>The Hongkou Women's Hospital, located at 290 Zhaofeng Road, Hongkou, was rented by Liang Meiyu, a female doctor and concubine of a Mr. Liang, from the Christian Jubilee Church last year. Besides Mr. Liang and Liang Meiyu living together, Mr. Liang's first wife, Meiyu's younger sister, and Fei Wangshi, a female servant from Wuxi, all lived upstairs in the hospital. On the 7th of this month, the Liangs suddenly moved all their valuables away, leaving only a few items in the rooms and leaving a substitute female servant of Fei Wangshi to guard the place. Until the other day, a deacon of the Jubilee Church suddenly noticed an unusually strong foul odor emanating from the hospital's examination room, which aroused his suspicion. He then ordered the female servant on guard to find the source of the odor, but because the room was tightly sealed, she could not enter. Looking through the window, she found nothing. Thus, at 6:00 p.m. the day before, she reported to the Huishan Police Station, which ordered Chinese detectives Huang Fugen and Cui Chengke, along with Western detectives and firefighters, to rush to the scene. They opened the door to the room and found a large, newly nailed rectangular tin box, with traces of lime nearby. The foul odor came from this box. They pried open the floorboards, and to their horror, discovered two nude corpses underneath, both covered with lime, their backs facing up.</p>
<p>They had already begun to decompose, and their faces were difficult to recognize, but it was roughly determined that one was male and one was female, though this could not be confirmed. At this time, Fei Wangshi also arrived at the scene, and the detectives immediately detained her. They then sent the corpses by hearse to the forensic examination office on Feilun Road. According to Fei Wangshi, she had been employed at the hospital since December of last year. On the 1st of this month, she returned to Wuxi and came back to Shanghai at 5:30 p.m. the day before. The female doctor Liang Meiyu's husband was sometimes called Mr. Liang and sometimes Mr. Wang. It was also known that he had another clinic located at No. 1, Lane 353, Nanjing Road, room 315 of the</p>
<p>Dalu Bazaar. The detectives then rushed to investigate, but found that the location was the clinic of Dr. Hou Guangdi, and there was no one inside. Later, checking the telephone directory, they found that Hou lived at 292 Binlang Road, so they rushed there again, but the house was already empty and had been vacated. They then discovered that Hou had opened a hospital at 370 Minguo Road a month ago, and went to investigate, but found no one there either. Subsequently, the detectives learned that Liang Meiyu was hiding at her sister's house at No. 10 Yile Lane, Tangshan Road.</p>
<p>They immediately went to arrest her, but Liang had left moments before. However, according to Fei Wangshi, before she returned to Wuxi, a woman with a serious illness came to the clinic for consultation. The doctor told her to stay at the hospital for treatment, and the woman's husband also stayed at the hospital. According to Yang Youmei, the gatekeeper of the hospital, on the 4th of this month, he heard the sound of floorboards being pried up in the hospital, but he did not pay attention at the time. Yesterday morning, the police sent Fei Wangshi to the Third Criminal Court of the Special No. 1 Court. Zhang Shizhu, the police lawyer, explained the situation in detail and requested that she be detained for further investigation. A deacon of the Jubilee Church then testified about the</p>
<p>circumstances of the discovery. When questioned, Fei Wangshi claimed that she knew nothing about the matter and that she had only arrived in Shanghai at 5:30 p.m. yesterday. Judge Zhong Qing reviewed the statement and ordered that Fei Wangshi be detained until the 18th of this month for further questioning. Subsequently, Tang, the prosecutor of the Special No. 1 Court, summoned Wei Ligong and Zhang Yan, two forensic doctors, and Wang Zuyi, a court clerk, to the forensic examination office to examine the bodies. He then ordered Fei Wangshi to go to the morgue to identify the two corpses. Because their faces had decomposed, they could not be identified. According to the forensic examination, it was determined that the two corpses were</p>
<p>one male and one female. The male's neck still had rope and gauze wrapped around it, while the female's neck had no rope, only gauze. Both corpses were about thirty years old, and their time of death was about one or two weeks ago. The forensic doctors then dissected the female corpse and found gauze adhering to her genital area. According to the forensic doctors' observations, it was either due to an abortion or a miscarriage, but it was still difficult to determine. However, it could be determined that she had been strangled. The gauze from the genital area was taken back by the forensic doctors for further study. Prosecutor Tang ordered that the deaths of the unnamed man and unnamed woman were determined to be due to strangulation. Before the identity of the corpses can be determined, the corpses will be handed over to the Pushan Villa for collection. The criminal in this case should be thoroughly investigated by the relevant police station and brought to justice.</p>

<h3>Chen Huizhang's Tragic Death: Coercion and Reconciliation Case Concluded, Englishman Massey Testifies in Court, Sentencing Scheduled for the 17th of This Month</h3>
<p>Chen Huizhang, a rickshaw puller, was beaten to death by British sailors in front of the British General Association on July 8 of this year. The All Circles organized a support association for the tragic death case, which caused a great sensation. Unexpectedly, it was later reconciled for a price of six hundred yuan. After the reconciliation, the father Chen Xizhu and wife Chen Zang sued Xu Jiesheng, a cadre of the Ximen Branch of the Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Association, Zhang Dengying, the general manager of the Mutual Aid Association, and Miao Jiande, for colluding with Cao Ada and impersonating Chen Zang's brother. Entrusted by Massey, the Englishman who was the chairman of the Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Association and the director of the Bureau of Public Works, they coerced her to put her fingerprints on the document to reconcile the death for six hundred yuan, and two hundred yuan was deducted, so she only received four hundred yuan. The deceased died unjustly, and the living suffered. They were distraught, flattering foreigners, and requested an investigation. After being summoned, the defendants claimed that they were acting with sincerity, seeking justice for the deceased and helping the living. They did not defraud or oppress them. The lady received the compensation from the police station herself, and they did not deduct any money. There was a background to harm them. They asked for Massey to be summoned to testify. Yesterday morning, Zhang Peiming, a judge of the District Court, opened the court and continued to examine the witness. Massey said that he was 60 years old, British, and was the director of motor vehicle affairs in the Bureau of Public Works, residing at No. 179 Jessfield Road. He asked if on July 8 of this year, a rickshaw puller was beaten to death by British sailors, and if you handled the matter of giving six hundred yuan. He answered, the reconciliation was handled by his wife. He asked, according to Xu Jiesheng, was the six hundred yuan paid at your place. He answered, his wife came to my office and said that she had received it. He asked, how much money did she get. He answered, six hundred yuan. He asked, did this six hundred yuan pass through your office. He answered, the woman received a total of six hundred yuan, which was given to her by the police station. She said that she was afraid of danger, so she put five hundred yuan in my office, and she took away one hundred yuan. He asked, when did she take the remaining five hundred yuan. He answered, she came to take it the next day. He asked, did the police station give her this money. The answer is that a person surnamed Yang in the police station represented the British sailor to pay her. He asked, how many people went to the police station in total. He answered, he did not see the woman directly, his subordinates reported it to me. He asked, since this woman got the money, why did she report to you. He answered, because I am the chairman of the Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Association, and she came to thank me. He asked, which of them went to the police station. He answered, his wife, her brother, and Xu Jiesheng. He asked, did Zhang Dengying go. He answered, no. He asked, who asked you to take care of this matter. He answered, Xu Jielian called me. At this point, Massey presented a written statement, claiming that this was the whole story and that there was a background of trouble now, requesting the court to accept the testimony. At this point, the official life began to debate. After the lawyers for both parties argued vigorously, the questioner announced the end of the debate and scheduled the sentencing for the 17th of this month.</p>
<h3>The Hardships of Slum Dwellers: The Municipal Federation Pleads on Their Behalf</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng She, the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation sent a letter to the Bureau of Public Works of the Public Concession yesterday, stating: "To whom it may concern, it is noted that the Shanghai Slum Dwellers' Federation has sent a letter stating that slum dwellers are the poorest citizens living in Shanghai. They are unable to rent houses, so they hastily build sheds in a corner of Pudong, barely sheltering from the wind and rain, in the hope of eking out a living and working hard. The Bureau of Public Works of the Public Concession has ordered them to demolish their homes by a deadline, disregarding our working-class compatriots. If this is implemented, they will be displaced and suffer even more. Who can not feel sympathy for this situation? We have appealed to all sectors of society in this city to rise up and provide assistance. At the same time, our Federation sent a letter to the Bureau of Public Works on August 31, requesting five conditions: (1) In the future, our slum dwellers will automatically restrict themselves from increasing in number; (2) If the landlord builds houses or the Bureau of Public Works needs to open roads, the slum dwellers will move; (3) Comply with the guidance of the Municipal Bureau of Wealth and improve sanitation facilities; (4) Request the Bureau of Public Works to revoke the demolition order to ensure their livelihood; (5) Request the Bureau of Public Works to promptly allocate funds to build public housing to accommodate slum dwellers in order to eliminate them in stages. While this case is being negotiated and the Bureau of Public Works has not made a clear statement, on September 2, the Yangshupu Police Station led a large number of Chinese and Western detectives and more than 80 workers, riding in police vehicles, and forcibly demolished the sheds at No. 448 Chaoyang Road, regardless of the circumstances. They beat people, causing more than 40 slum dwellers to be injured, and arrested and transferred them to the court, charging them with Article 150 of the Criminal Law. As a result, all the slum dwellers panicked and convened a meeting to make five resolutions: (1) Request the Bureau of Public Works to stop the demolition; (2) Detectives who are derelict in their duties should be punished; (3) Guarantee that the same situation will not happen again in the future; (4) Release the arrested poor people; (5) The Bureau of Public Works shall be responsible for medical expenses and compensation for losses for the injured. The records are on file. We have often sent letters to the Bureau of Public Works requesting implementation. However, due to the anxiety and uneasiness of the people, we dare to ask your Federation to consider the hardships of the small and weak ethnic groups and approve the above five conditions to negotiate with the Bureau of Public Works again, so that they can be fully implemented, and our tens of thousands of slum dwellers will benefit greatly. The Federation has checked that slum dwellers are the poorest of the poor in the city. The Federation deeply regrets the unfortunate case of Chaoyang Road. It should be considered that the slums are suffering and should be decided to be implemented as requested."</p>

<h3>Both Cases of Robbery and Accusation at Xue Mai Luo's Office Concluded: Zhang Zuming Sues Zhou Jinggeng Et Al., Zhuang Jimeng Also Sues Zhang Zuming, Both Cases Combined for Trial, Sentencing Scheduled</h3>
<p>In the case of the robbery of cash worth more than one thousand yuan at Xue Mai Luo Accounting Firm, Wanhao, Edward Road, French Concession, in the afternoon of June 9, 1934, the suspect Zhang Zuming (Ningbo native, shareholder of Ruichangshun No. 5 Yu, Broadway Road) was arrested after reporting to the police station. Zhang also confessed to Zhuang Ji (owner of Zhuangyuan), Wang Lianyou (runner of Wuyu), Tang Qingyue (dean of Dade Hospital) and other three people, who were subsequently arrested and transferred to the Special No. 2 Court, where they were prosecuted by the Legal Police Department. Because there was no evidence of a crime, Zhang, Zhuang, Wang, and Tang were declared innocent. Because the Police Department repeatedly appealed, the</p>
<p>third trial still upheld the original judgment. Later, Zhang Zuming hired a lawyer to send a letter to Zhou Jinggeng (victim of the robbery), a comprador at Xue Mai Luo Accounting Firm, accusing him of being innocently implicated in the detention and suffering losses, and demanding compensation of 32,000 yuan. Because Zhou ignored it, Zhang filed a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Special Court, suing Zhou Jinggeng, Gao Yuhua, Feng Ti'e, Wan Guirong, Qian Genghua, Wang Guixiang, and others for jointly fabricating evidence and falsely accusing him, requesting an investigation, and attached a civil suit, seeking</p>
<p>damages of 50,000 yuan. At the same time, Zhuang Jimeng also felt unwilling to be unjustly accused by Zhang Zuming, detained, and imprisoned, so he hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Special No. 1 Court, suing Zhang Zuming for the crime of false accusation, and attached a civil suit, seeking damages of 50,000 yuan. After the trial by the Special No. 1 Court, the case was transferred to the Special No. 2 Court for trial due to incorrect jurisdiction in the French Concession. The Special No. 2 Court filed the complaint, and the case was handled by the former Judge Li Changnian.</p>
<p>The two cases have been combined and tried twice without a conclusion, as detailed in previous reports. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Chen Shuoying of the Special No. 2 Court presided over the Second Criminal Court and summoned the parties of both parties to continue the trial. First, Zhang Zuming sued Zhou Jinggeng et al. The case was reopened and the plaintiff Zhang Zuming was ordered to state the facts of the complaint. He said that he accused the defendants Zhou Jinggeng et al. of false testimony and false accusation. At that time, I was walking properly and was identified as a robber, detained by the police station, and beaten, causing damage to my reputation, spirit, and business.</p>
<p>Various damages were requested for investigation and judgment, and compensation was ordered for my losses of 30,000 yuan. Zhou Jinggeng testified that I was not at the scene during the robbery. After the robbery, I reported to the police station. When the robber searched Gao Yushu, he said that he had copied morphine. Please ask Gao about a package of banknotes robbed from Gao's side. After the police station detained the plaintiff, I only submitted a complaint and filed a private lawsuit, and did not name and report the plaintiff as a thief. Gao Yushu testified that he clearly saw the face of the robber who robbed me. It was absolutely impossible to make a mistake. After the police station arrested the plaintiff, he called me to identify him in the crowd. If it wasn't him, he said</p>
<p>How could he have confessed so clearly when his mind was confused? He was the first to enter the door with a pistol. I was robbed of 6,000 yuan. Feng Ti'e testified that the police station called me to identify him. I identified the plaintiff in the crowd because the plaintiff was the first person to enter the door during the robbery. The remaining Wan Guirong, Qian Genghua, Wang Guixiang, etc. had the same testimony. At this point, the official told that the circumstances of the case were all in the file, and today the debate can be opened. Then the plaintiff's agent lawyer Lu Dingkui and the defendant's defense lawyers Bian Jialu and Zhang Shanle</p>
<p>debated fiercely. The plaintiff's lawyer said that the defendants' identification of the plaintiff as a thief was recorded in detail in the public prosecution record and should be judged according to law. The defendant's defense lawyer said that the plaintiff's allegations were all unsubstantiated and requested that the defendant be declared innocent. After the debate, the court announced the end of the debate and scheduled the sentencing for 2:00 p.m. on the 15th. Then Zhuang Jimeng sued Zhang Zuming for false accusation. The plaintiff Zhuang Jimeng said that the defendant Zhang Zuming was first arrested and falsely accused me, Wang Lianyou, and Tang Qingyue, and was also arrested and sent to your court</p>
<p>The judgment was innocent. At that time, Zhang confessed in the police station that I had used all my pistols to rob. Because I often patrolled specially, I had a pistol, and he also confessed that the stolen money was divided in my car after the robbery. There was no basis at all. I requested an investigation. After I was arrested, my reputation, body, and business were all damaged. I attached a civil suit, seeking compensation for losses of 50,000 yuan. Asked the defendant Zhang Zuming, at that time I was arrested to the police station, asked me to confess my accomplices, slapped me in the face, and took a wooden stick to hit me, and said that if I didn't tell, I would grind electricity. I was forced to lose consciousness and could not confess the plaintiff, etc. However, the plaintiff and I were classmates and relatives. I was really confused and confessed him, otherwise I would never harm him. After the lawyers from both sides debated each other, the court announced the end of the debate and scheduled the sentencing for 1:00 p.m. on the 15th. He left the court immediately.</p>

<h3>Woman Missing: Bizarre Circumstances</h3>
<p>Recently, strange cases have emerged one after another in this city. The case of the corpse in a suitcase found outside the Waibaidu Bridge on Suzhou Road in the Public Concession has just begun to show some clues, while the case of the two buried corpses at the Hongkou Women's Hospital has followed closely behind. Unexpectedly, a bizarre disappearance of a woman occurred in the French Concession yesterday. The strangeness and twists of the case surpass the previous two. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Brief Biography of the Sichuan Woman</p>
<p>Guo Yunxia, a Sichuan woman of thirty-some years old, is a woman who received a considerable education.  She is inherently chivalrous and has a masculine spirit. She married a Mr. Zong, also from Sichuan. The couple came to Shanghai together and have been here for several years. Mr. Zong once served in the 19th Route Army. After the January 28th Incident ended, he returned to work for the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau but passed away in his Shanghai residence last spring due to poor health.</p>
<p>After Her Husband's Death</p>
<p>Mrs. Guo was distraught by her husband's death and nearly lost the will to live. Fortunately, a Mr. Wang, a close friend of Mr. Zong from Anhui, was in Shanghai. He stepped forward to handle all the funeral arrangements for Mr. Zong and raised funds for his coffin and burial. Mrs. Guo deeply appreciated Mr. Wang's kindness and wanted to repay him.</p>
<p>Running Around for a Friend</p>
<p>At the end of last month, Mr. Wang was suddenly arrested for a case and is currently detained in the Public Concession Police Station, awaiting a verdict. Upon hearing this news, Mrs. Guo, out of a sense of gratitude, began to run around and seek help from all sides for Mr. Wang. She even wrote to a businessman twice, requesting him to uphold justice.</p>
<p>Someone Visits</p>
<p>After Mrs. Guo sent the two letters, time passed without a response. Mrs. Guo gradually put the matter aside. Unexpectedly, at around 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, an uninvited guest, a man of around forty years old, with a sturdy build, a dark complexion, and wearing a grayish-brown silk shirt, arrived at Mrs. Guo's residence on the third floor of No. 2, Cishou Lane, Route Saopesai in the French Concession. He asked if Mrs. Wang was home.</p>
<p>Car Awaits</p>
<p>Mrs. Guo happened to be at home. She asked the visitor where he was from. The man said he was sent by Mr. So-and-so to invite her for a face-to-face conversation and urged her to go immediately, saying that a car was waiting at the entrance of the alley. As he spoke, the man handed Mrs. Guo his business card.</p>
<p>Reading the Card</p>
<p>Mrs. Guo took the card and read it carefully. On the front were the words "To Mrs. Wang, No.  , Cishou Lane, Route Saopesai." On the back, it read, "Both letters have been received. Please come to discuss matters in person. Sincerely, Mrs. Wang." At the end was a signature, "Song," and a square seal, but upon closer inspection, the seal appeared to be hastily made.</p>
<p>Going by Car Together</p>
<p>After receiving the card, Mrs. Guo was overjoyed. She handed the card to her male servant, Gao Xisheng, immediately changed her clothes, and happily went with the visitor into a black sedan with a black license plate. As Mrs. Guo left, she specifically told the male servant, "I will be back soon. If anyone comes to visit, please ask them to wait."</p>
<p>Not Returning Late at Night</p>
<p>After Mrs. Guo left, Gao Xisheng, the male servant, stayed at the residence and waited. He waited until late at night but still did not see her return. At first, he suspected that Mrs. Guo had been delayed by important matters. Unexpectedly, by yesterday morning, Mrs. Guo still had not returned. He became suspicious and went to a nearby shop to call Mr. So-and-so's residence to inquire directly. He was told that Mr. So-and-so had not sent anyone with a card to invite Mrs. Guo for a conversation yesterday. Gao received this information and knew that something was wrong. He still hoped that Mrs. Guo would return safely, but all through last night, Mrs. Guo was still nowhere to be found.</p>

<h3>Zhang Pinfu Sentenced to Six Years in Prison for Killing Matchmaker</h3>
<p>Zhang Pinfu, a copper smith from the Shanghai Electric Power Company machine room on Yangshupu Road, married Jiang Afeng in May of this year, with Wang Jiasheng (45 years old), a Suzhou native and colleague, acting as the matchmaker. Upon discovering that Wang and Afeng had been having an affair for years, Zhang was overcome with rage. At 1:00 PM on the 3rd of this month, in the company's toilet, he used a triangular knife to stab Wang multiple times in the head and abdomen, inflicting a total of seven wounds. The injured Wang was rushed to Renji Hospital but died the next day. Zhang Pinfu was arrested by Chinese detectives   Wenzao and Su Yinggen of the Yangshupu Police Station and sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhong Qing presided over the continued hearing in the criminal court. Zhang Shuizhu, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, filed a public prosecution based on Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, the crime of homicide. Xu Yaolin, from Wuxi, testified that he was an employee of the company and that the defendant was his wife's younger brother. He stated that after his wife, Jiang Afeng, and Wang Jiasheng got married, they initially got along well. Wang Jiasheng acted as the matchmaker. Recently, he suspected that Afeng and Wang were having an affair. He came several times, saying that he wanted to deal with it drastically. He advised Zhang to stop it, but unexpectedly, this incident still happened that day. Jiang Genlong, from Pudong, testified that he was a colleague of the defendant. He said that Wang Jiasheng was the original matchmaker for Afeng's marriage, and he assisted. He stated that he did not know about Afeng and Wang Jiasheng's affair beforehand. Recently, Wang told him that the defendant was going to harm his life, and he also tried to dissuade him. Questioned, the defendant confessed that he was in a state of confusion at the time and did not intentionally kill Wang. He was filled with anger, which led to the disaster. He asked for leniency. Judge Zhong sentenced Zhang Pinfu to six years in prison as a warning. Miao Jinxiu wrote the record.</p>

<h3>The Case Against Le Zhenbao and Others is Concluded After Debate is Rescinded: Continued Interrogation Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai West Paint Industry Association, represented by Ma Shangjie, filed a lawsuit in the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court through lawyers Zhang Shizhao and Chao Kun, against Le Zhenbao, Bei Runsheng, Zhang Lanping, Le Gengrong, and others regarding a property dispute with the Foreign Goods Business Association. The debate had originally concluded, and a date was set for the verdict. However, because the presiding judge felt that the case was not yet clear, he specifically rescinded the conclusion of the debate and ordered a new date for reopening the debate. This has been reported in previous issues. Yesterday, Judge Chen Shuoying summoned the plaintiff and members Wang Zuolin, Su Xiangxuan, Zhong Le Shan, Fang E, Dong Yuzhen, Li Shuyan, Hu Runsheng, Xia Kuisheng, Chen Gengsheng, Qin Lianliang, and others, as well as the defendants, to continue the hearing in the criminal court. The four defendants arrived with their defense attorneys, Yan Yinwu, Lin Rongqing, and Yuan Hanyun. The court first asked the plaintiff, Ma Shangjie, whether he had a letter of authorization from the association to represent them in the lawsuit. Ma replied that there were signatures from members and letters to prove that he had previously submitted them to the court and that the letter of authorization could be submitted tomorrow. The court then summoned the plaintiff's members, except for Shen Leshan, Ding Fang E, Li Shuyan, and Chen Gengsheng, who did not attend. Wang Zuolin, Su Xiangxuan, Dong Yuzhen, Hu Runsheng, Xia Kuisheng, Qin Lianliang, and the other six who attended testified that they had previously donated money to the association and that the donation receipts had been lost due to the passage of time and could not be produced. Defendant Bei Runsheng testified that he had previously served as a director of the Foreign Goods Business Association but resigned in 1927. In 1931, he published a statement in the newspaper and submitted three copies of the newspaper as evidence. Zhang Lanping testified that he had served as a director of the Foreign Goods Business Association after 1927 and 1928. The affairs of the association were managed by four people, including President Xiang Rusong and Wang Xiaoxin. The Zhenxin Club was reorganized in 1929 and 1930, and the Renyi Association was reorganized in 1934. A general meeting was held beforehand, and it was reported to the City Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau. The reason was that the association had always handled public welfare undertakings, but since each industry had established its own association, there was no need to continue handling public welfare affairs. Therefore, it was proposed to expand and reorganize the Renyi Charity Association. The property was previously managed by the Foreign Goods Business Association, then transferred to the Zhenxin Club after the reorganization, and then to the Renyi Charity Association after the reorganization of the Renyi Charity Association. However, the land for the association was initially purchased by Le Zhenbao. Due to the deed, it was under Le's name. It was previously kept by Bei Runsheng and is now kept by the Ruikang Firm. The money was deposited in Hengli Bank in relation to the association. At this point, the defendant's attorney, Yuan Hanyun, stated his opinion, asking whether the representative, Ma Shangjie,</p>
<p>Submitted a Letter of Authorization</p>
<p>Ma said that he would submit it tomorrow. He also asked whether the witnesses who attended today understood the situation of the case, whether they agreed to the lawsuit, and whether the lawsuit against the defendants was about a criminal matter or a property issue. Because the witness Wang Zuolin, who attended, is now a member of the executive committee of the Renyi Charity Association, there is no reason for him to sue himself. Zhang Lanping also testified that he did not manage the money in the association. When the association initially purchased the land, it was under Le Zhenbao's name because foreign merchants transferred the deed and needed an individual to come forward, so Le came forward. Also, when the association's</p>
<p>funds were insufficient in the beginning, Le helped to raise money. The court listened to the testimony and did not understand the situation of the land deeds in Shanghai. After the defendant's attorney, Yuan Hanyun, briefly described the history of purchasing land and transferring deeds through registration by foreign merchants in Shanghai concessions, the court asked the plaintiff's witness, Wang Zuolin, whether he held a position in the Renyi Charity Association. Wang replied that although the Renyi Charity Association elected him to be an executive committee member, he had not been there. Before the reorganization, a general meeting was held, but the number of people present was not enough to make a decision. The court then asked the defendant, Zhang Lanping, whether there were minutes of the meeting. Zhang replied that there was a summary and that he would have to look for it. Later, the court questioned the defendant, Le Zhenbao, who admitted that he handled the purchase of</p>
<p>the association's land. The land originally belonged to Wang Xiaoxin and was mortgaged to Dehe Foreign Firm for 2,000 pounds. Before the expiration of the mortgage, it was sold to the association. He handled the transaction and came forward to buy it, totaling three acres and six cents of land. He also handled the expiration of the mortgage, borrowing money from the Baojia Insurance Company to repay the mortgage. At that time, the association's donations were insufficient, so he helped to raise the money. The land deed is currently in his possession, and the deed is in Ruikang Firm. If either one is missing, it cannot be sold or mortgaged. The land was purchased during the Qing Guangxu era. After questioning this far, the court considered the case complex and needed to investigate the minutes of the Renyi Charity Association's reorganization meeting, the land deed of the Hengli Bank transaction, and other documents. The court announced that the hearing would be adjourned and would resume at 2:00 PM on the 18th. The court then adjourned.</p>
<h3>The Case of Gan Weilu Refusing to Pay Municipal Taxes Ends</h3>
<p>The case of lawyer Gan Weilu, who previously raised six reasons for refusing to pay property taxes, caused a sensation for a time. The Public Works Department entrusted three lawyers, Bo Liang, Ru Baoyi, and Shi Baoliang, to file a lawsuit with the First Special District Court. The initial trial ruled that Gan Weilu should repay the full amount. Gan refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Second Higher Court, but to no avail. The original verdict was upheld. After the case was finalized, Gan still failed to comply with the judgment. The Public Works Department then obtained the court's approval to issue an execution warrant to enforce the judgment. Gan had no choice but to comply and paid the full amount of taxes due. Thus, the much-publicized lawsuit came to an end.</p>
<h3>The Newspaper Industry Union Hosts a Banquet for Zhu Xuefan</h3>

The Lianqing Society, an organization of leaders from all walks of life in this city, has invited Mr. Wang to give a lecture at its regular meeting at the International YMCA at 12:30 PM on the 14th of this month to allow its members to understand the new invention.</p>
<h3>Maritime Groups Host a Series of Public Banquets for Wang Oumin</h3>
<p>Mr. Jiang Oumin, the executive director of the Jianghai Wheel Middle Cabin Office, has worked hard in the maritime industry in recent years and has achieved considerable success. During the previous "Wusong Wheel" tragedy, he successfully planned and won. The Chinese Seamen's Union specifically dispatched Yang Xiaotian to send personnel to take over the Guangdong branch and reorganize it into the Guangdong branch. He was appointed as one of the standing committee members of the association. Because the time he spent in Guangdong for the Wusong case was very long, his feelings were extremely harmonious in all aspects. In particular, he was trusted by the group of workers. This mission will surely bring infinite benefits to the future of shipping. It is heard that Wang is scheduled to set off on the Taikoo Qingyuan Wheel today. His friends have hosted banquets to send him off in recent days. Last night, Special Commissioner Yang, Secretary Wang Jiyi, Section Chief Wang Yalun, and Shanghai Branch Committee Member Peng Zhongren, Section Chief Cheng Yongming, Acting Director of the Inland River Office Song Xiaoyun, Standing Director of Jardine Matheson Stevedores Club Chen Yuanlong, Standing Director of the Little Yangtze Wheel United Club Wang Wenhua, Standing Director of the Taikoo Stevedores Club Qian Zhigang, and more than 100 people from the Commercial Wheel Lianyi Association, China Merchants Stevedores Office, Yan Ying General Society, and Jardine Matheson Tongyi Society held public money in the Daya Building and the Zhimei Building.</p>
<h3>The Garment Industry Trade Union Expands Membership Recruitment</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Garment Industry Trade Union was established in 1931. It has worked diligently and has made considerable progress over the years. The union's directors, Chen Xinhua, Weng Liangsheng, and others, believe that the workers in the industry are scattered in all directions and have not been concentrated. In order to strengthen the union's power, the sixth meeting of the board of directors has decided to expand membership recruitment. From September 11th to September 26th, all male and female workers in the industry can register with the union. Temporary registration offices have been set up in Nanshi, Zhabei, Special District 1, and Special District 2. It is heard that many workers have been enthusiastically registering to join the union in recent days.</p>
<h3>The Central Savings Association Will Hold a Lottery: Open for Business as Usual Today and Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Central Savings Association's sixth lottery drawing will be held on the 15th of this month. The special prize is still 15,000 yuan. The number of first, second, third, and fourth prizes has been increased to twelve each.

Yesterday, although there were still four days before the lottery, the depositors at the counters were packed shoulder to shoulder. To facilitate depositors' payments and memberships, the association will be open for business as usual this afternoon, Saturday, and all day tomorrow, Sunday, to avoid any regrets.</p>
<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editors,</p>
<p>In today's newspaper, the news item entitled "Pudong Waterworks Construction" mentions the situation of the Pudong Waterworks project and states that the plant is being implemented by the "Greater Shanghai Water Company." This is incorrect. The Pudong Waterworks is one of the projects under our management and is being handled by the Municipal Government. The plant is directly under our jurisdiction and there is no such thing as the "Greater Shanghai Water Company." Also, the news item was translated from the mainland press. When the reporter from that newspaper came to our company to interview us about the news, we answered in detail. The next day, when the newspaper published the article, it clearly wrote our company name as Greater Shanghai City Trust, and there was no mention of the "Greater Shanghai Water Company." We are deeply concerned that this will cause misunderstanding among the public and are therefore requesting that you correct this.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>General Affairs Department, Shanghai Industrial Trust, 25,  , 11,</p>

<p>Educational News</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan Orders Emphasis on National Children's Education and Health: Orders the Two Ministries of Interior and Education and the Department of Health to Expedite the Planning of Agencies for Children's Welfare</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, November 11th) The Executive Yuan ordered the Ministry of Interior to investigate that children's welfare has more than one aspect, and that the most important aspects are children's education and children's health. Recent surveys of the Beijing-Tianjin area found that there are more than 20,000 children out of school. The total number of children out of school nationwide is more than 30 million. The number is shockingly high. In recent years, the collapse of the rural economy and the inability of farmers' children to attend school are important reasons. However, there are too few elementary schools in various places. If all school-age children were to enroll, there would not be enough space. At present, there are no concrete relief measures for the problem of school-age children who are out of school, and thus there is no way to urge and emphasize physical education and health. At present, the agency responsible for children's welfare has not yet been established, and the above two points cannot be delayed. The Ministry of Interior, together with the Ministry of Education and the Department of Health, should quickly plan and implement measures to promote it.</p>
<p>The French Book Exhibition at Aurora University Opens Today: French Donation to the Peiping Library: Pre-exhibition of Art Books also Held</p>
<p>The new library of Aurora University in this city has been fully completed. The opening ceremony is scheduled for 4:00 PM today. The French book exhibition, which has been in preparation for a long time, will also open at the same time. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony of the New Library</p>
<p>The school previously found that the original library had a growing number of books and was insufficient. Therefore, last summer, it began construction of a four-story building in the west campus of the school. In addition to a portion of the building being used as the university's office and the law school's lecture hall, the remaining portion was used for the library. Construction has been underway for more than a year and was fully completed last month. The opening ceremony is scheduled to be held in the new library at 3:00 PM this afternoon, and guests from all walks of life are invited to visit.</p>
<p>French Exhibition Opens Today</p>
<p>To celebrate the opening of the new library, the school will hold a French book exhibition starting at 4:00 PM this afternoon. In addition to the various books in the library's collection, a large number of new works have been obtained from major French publishers, totaling 46 units and occupying 125 square meters, with a value of 100,000 French francs, for viewing. At the same time, various art books donated by the French Book Industry Association to the Peiping Library in China will also be pre-exhibited here starting today. It is expected that there will be a grand occasion at that time.</p>
<h3>The Recent Four Years of National Central University (6)</h3>
<p>— Luo Jialun</p>
<p>17. Advocating Research and Encouraging Academic Publications</p>
<p>For faculty members who are interested in engaging in specialized research, we have spared no effort in providing the necessary equipment and facilities to the best of our ability. We also aim to publish the results of their research to gain recognition from the international academic community for our university. In the past four academic years, we have published four series of journals: the Literary Series, the Education Series, and the Agricultural Series, each of which has reached Volume 3, Issue 1; the Social Sciences Series has reached Volume 2, Issue 2. Additionally, we have published more than ten types of scientific reports and other academic research reports, some of which have been translated into German or English and have received praise from the international academic community. Although these are just initial results, there will certainly be a day in the future when they will continue to be promoted and developed.</p>
<p>18. Striving for Cooperation with Academic Institutions and Integrating with National and Social Undertakings. Over the past four years, whenever the nation and society have needed to develop undertakings, our university has done its best to assist, proceeding with cooperation and considering its capacity. For example, we have helped the Huai River Commission analyze the soil in the Huai River basin, assisted the military authorities in surveying oil in Sichuan, undertaken afforestation for the capital's fortresses, sent personnel to the Yunnan border to investigate biology, co-organized the Yunnan Border Geographical Survey Team with the Resources Committee, co-organized cotton training classes with the National Economic Council, co-organized the Jiangpu Cotton Planting Guidance Center with the Central Cotton Improvement Institute, surveyed the geology of the entire Jiangning Autonomous Experimental County, improved silkworm and wheat varieties, designed electric irrigation, and assisted in the operation of agricultural improvement projects in experimental townships. We have jointly carried out rice, wheat, cotton, and miscellaneous grain experiments in more than twenty locations with agricultural experiment stations in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hunan, Sichuan, and other provinces and counties; cooperated with the Ministry of Health and the Nanjing Municipal Government to run health clinics and hygiene experiment services; cooperated with the Ministry of Industry to compile Chinese economic statistics; cooperated with the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission to conduct hydraulic engineering experiments; investigated English teaching materials in secondary schools nationwide for the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture; and operated a consultation center for children's issues for the National Children's Year Implementation Committee. These are all verifiable examples. Furthermore, the establishment of the Educational Experiment Institute, the Economic Data Room, and the Administrative Research Data Room within the university are all preparations to train students to research current practical problems, in order to make the national university education somewhat beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>However, our university's current location is in the center of the city, surrounded by streets on all sides, with an area of only over two hundred mu. It is cramped and narrow, leaving no room for development, which causes the College of Agriculture to be separated from the main part of the university, making teaching facilities extremely uneconomical. Various agricultural experiment fields are also scattered in different locations, not together with the various departments, creating many difficulties in terms of experimental research. At the same time, various experimental factories urgently need to be added to the College of Engineering, including the experimental factories for special machinery research classes, all of which require a large area. The facilities for pathology, anatomy, and clinical diagnosis at the College of Medicine also have no space to accommodate them, making it difficult to proceed. As for the housing problem for faculty and students, it is especially necessary to provide adequate solutions to ensure the physical and mental well-being of educators. All of these are urgent needs based on facts and cannot be delayed. As for being mixed in with the city, which is not suitable for cultivating a noble and pure academic atmosphere, the principle is self-evident and there is no need to elaborate further. Fortunately, this matter has been approved by the government, and a decision has been made to actively proceed, first expanding and rebuilding the Colleges of Engineering, Agriculture, and Science, which are in the most urgent need of facilities, to support the central government's original intention of promoting practical science education and to meet the current urgent needs of the country. Moreover, the current location of the College of Physical Education has been traversed and divided by the newly opened Fujian, Chahar, Heilongjiang, and other roads. The special equipment and factories of the College of Engineering also urgently need to be expanded and added. All of these are pressing issues. Fortunately, the location of the new campus has been determined after many surveys, near Shizigang on Jingjian Road outside Zhonghua Gate. It has been approved by the government. The area faces Zijin Mountain to the north, connects to Niushou Mountain to the south, leans against Fang Mountain to the east, and looks out over the Yangtze River to the west from a high vantage point. The future construction area within the campus will be surrounded by mountains, with a small river crossing in front, lush trees, and extremely beautiful scenery. It is truly an ideal place for academic research. Moreover, it is still in the urban area, only three or four kilometers from the city, and not isolated from the city. It simply seeks a location on the periphery of the city that allows for concentrated research, adequate facilities, and expansion at any time. Furthermore, with its convenient transportation, it can still maintain cooperative relationships with various cultural, academic, and health institutions in the capital. As for all matters related to building construction, equipment, and the custody and distribution of funds, it has been approved that the Ministry of Education establish a Construction and Equipment Committee to take charge. The selection of personnel will be approved and hired by the Ministry of Education, and those with knowledge and experience from outside institutions will be invited to participate in the guidance to show prudence and impartiality.</p>
<p>The above are just the major points. There are still many incomplete and imperfect areas. I hope that wise people will provide guidance and assistance, which will not only be the good fortune of National Central University. (End)</p>

<h3>Xiao Wuquan's Painting Exhibition Opens Today</h3>

<h3>Chen Jianmin Discusses National Defense and Mental Science</h3>
<p>Chen Jianmin of the China Mental Science Research Association discusses that the key to national defense, in the active aspect, is the development of combat power. The power of combat, on one hand, relates to weapons and physique, but fundamentally relies entirely on mental action for its transformation. "The best strategy is to attack the mind," as the ancient saying goes. The power of matter is small, and the power of the mind is great. Dr. Sun Yat-sen has already shown this to the public in his speeches on the spiritual education of soldiers. Today, military officers often pay attention to the preparation of material conditions. I sincerely hope that the army, in addition to technical training, will also supplement it with mental training. Regarding the mental training of soldiers, this association is currently drafting a concrete plan and will soon submit it to the military authorities for adoption. This is regarding the active aspect. As for the passive aspect, it is still necessary to prevent the reduction of combat power. If soldiers are injured or become ill, although ordinary military doctors are responsible for treatment, once wartime mental or neurological diseases occur, spiritual therapy must be used, but currently there are no specialized doctors in our country's army. During the European War, the Higher Neurological Hospital of France first adopted spiritual therapy, and at that time, British psychologist Dr. Brown was hired as a medical officer to specialize in treating this disease, with the most significant results. Dr. Brown alone cured more than three thousand wartime mental and neurological patients in the hospital using spiritual therapy. The number of such sick soldiers in other hospitals is not included. It can be seen that this disease is important in wartime. Therefore, mental science has a significant relationship to any aspect of national defense. I sincerely hope that the people of the country will rise up and study it, etc.</p>

<p>(V) (IX) Ninth Day of the Games</p>
<p>The ninth day of the Games saw the complete end of the track and field events, and the start of the swimming events, with finals in some categories.

<p>Track and Field</p>
<p>Marathon Final</p>
<p>The marathon final was held at 3:00 PM. The starting and finishing points were both in the Games stadium. There were 52 runners at the start, but 10 dropped out midway, so only 42 completed the entire course. Japanese athlete Son Kitei remarkably won the championship with a time of 2 hours, 29 minutes, 19.2 seconds, breaking the Games record (set by the previous champion, Zabala of Argentina, at 2 hours, 31 minutes, 36 seconds). Another Japanese athlete, Nan Shoryu, won third place, with the same time as the second-place British athlete, Hapen, only a shoulder's length behind. When the news spread, the whole city of Berlin was stirred. Only two of the three long-distance runners from Finland managed to secure fourth and fifth place, and the other one was eliminated. The previous champion, Zabala of Argentina, who had been leading the way up to 28,000 meters, withdrew due to exhaustion at 31,000 meters, which was also unexpected. Our Chinese athlete, Wang ZhengLin, fought hard and, although he finished in 40th place, it was no easy feat to complete the entire course. Wang's time was 3 hours, 15 minutes, 36.4 seconds, almost an hour behind the first-place winner.</p>
<p>Son Kitei (Japan) 2 hours, 29 minutes, 19 seconds</p>
<p>Hapen (England) 2 hours, 30 minutes, 23.2 seconds</p>
<p>Nan Shoryu (Japan) Same as above</p>
<p>Taimila (Finland) 2 hours, 32 minutes, 45 seconds</p>
<p>Munanen (Finland) 2 hours, 33 minutes, 46 seconds</p>
<p>Kaurman (South Africa) 2 hours, 36 minutes, 17 seconds</p>
<p>Women's High Jump Final</p>
<p>The women's high jump final was held at 3:00 PM with a total of 17 participants. The qualifying height was set at 1.60 meters, with the starting height at 1.30 meters. One person failed to clear it. When the height was raised to 1.40 meters, another three were eliminated. At 1.50 meters, another five stepped down. Then, at 1.55 meters, another three were eliminated. At 1.58 meters, another two were eliminated. Only three people cleared 1.60 meters. As a result, Szak of Hungary took first place with a jump of 1.62 meters, which was 0.03 meters short of the Games and world record of 1.65 meters set by the previous champion, Healy of the United States. It was a novel situation in all sports that only three jumpers were ranked in this competition.</p>
<p>(1) Szak (Hungary) 1.62 meters</p>
<p>(2) Oldham (England) 1.60 meters</p>
<p>(3) Kahl (Germany) 1.60 meters</p>
<p>Men's 4x100m Relay Final</p>
<p>At 2:10 PM, the men's 400-meter relay final saw the US team still fielding Owens, Metcalfe, Tellep, and Wykoff. Owens ran the first leg, finishing the 100 meters with a lead of three meters over the other teams. Metcalfe continued, and by the end of 200 meters, the lead had increased to six meters. Tellep gained another meter, and when Wykoff took the baton and finished, the lead was over ten meters. They broke the 40-second barrier, setting a new world record with 39.8 seconds (the US team set the previous record of 40 seconds in 1932). The Netherlands team was originally in second place, but the last runner accidentally fell upon receiving the baton, resulting in disqualification, which was a great pity.</p>
<p>(1) United States 39.8 seconds</p>
<p>(2) Italy 41.1 seconds</p>
<p>(3) Germany 41.2 seconds</p>
<p>(4) Argentina 42.7 seconds</p>
<p>(5) Canada 42.7 seconds</p>
<p>Women's 4x100m Relay Final</p>
<p>The women's 400-meter relay final was held at 3:30 PM. Great Britain was in the innermost lane, followed by Italy, the United States, Germany, Canada, and the Netherlands. Germany had the most balanced talent and the strongest overall strength. The first three runners for Germany led all the way, with the United States lagging behind by four or five meters. However, the last runner for Germany accidentally fell upon receiving the baton, ruining all their efforts. Ms. Dowflerite covered her face and wept, filled with sorrow and anger. The last runner for the US team, Ms. Stephens, used her final sprint to reach the finish line first with a time of 46.9 seconds, equaling the Games record set by the US team at the previous Games. Great Britain finished second, five meters behind.</p>
<p>First place: United States 46.9 seconds</p>
<p>Second place: Great Britain 47.6 seconds</p>
<p>Third place: Canada 47.8 seconds</p>
<p>Fourth place: Italy 48.7 seconds</p>
<p>Fifth place: Netherlands 48.8 seconds</p>
<p>Men's 4x400m Relay Final</p>

Sweden was in the innermost lane, Germany in the second lane, Hungary in the third lane, the United States in the fourth lane, Canada in the fifth lane, and Great Britain in the outermost lane. In the end, Great Britain defeated the United States by eight meters, which was no easy feat. The first runner for Great Britain took the lead immediately, and the speed of the subsequent two runners was also very consistent. By the time Brown took the last leg, the lead over the US team was already seven meters. Although Frederick made every effort to catch up, it was to no avail. The time for the British team was 3 minutes and 9 seconds, which was still far from the world and Games record set by the US team in the previous Games (3 minutes, 8.2 seconds).</p>
<p>First place: Great Britain 3 minutes, 9 seconds</p>
<p>Second place: United States 3 minutes, 11 seconds</p>
<p>Third place: Germany 3 minutes, 11.8 seconds</p>
<p>Fourth place: Canada</p>

<p>Women's 100m Freestyle Semi-finals</p>
<p>The women's 100-meter freestyle semi-finals were held at 3:00 PM, divided into two groups of eight each. Three from each group, plus the fastest fourth-place finisher, qualified for the final. In the first group, Hermon defeated Germany by one meter, setting a new Games record with an outstanding time of 1 minute 6.4 seconds. In the second group, Argentina and the Netherlands competed fiercely all the way, with no clear advantage. At the finish line, they were only a palm's length apart, and both of their times broke the Games record.</p>
<p>Group One</p>
<p>Mastin Brooke (Netherlands) 1 minute 6.4 seconds</p>
<p>Arante (Germany) 1 minute 7.2 seconds</p>

<p>Men's 100m Freestyle Final</p>
<p>The men's 100-meter freestyle final was held at 3:10 PM, with participants from Japan (3), USA (2), and Germany and Hungary (1 each). The three Japanese athletes had repeatedly broken the Games record in the preliminary and semi-final rounds, creating a great stir. It was generally predicted that they would easily sweep the top three places, and only the American Fick could offer some competition. Unexpectedly, after the start, Széchy of Hungary boldly surged forward without any slackening. The three Japanese athletes swam leisurely, following behind. It wasn't until the last 30 meters that they frantically chased, but it was too late. Széchy snatched the championship by half an arm's length, surprising the entire arena. The American athletes were in poor form, and Fick was defeated by Fisscher of Germany, finishing in fourth place. Lindegren was also eliminated. Although Széchy's time broke the Games record, it was still slower than the 57.5 seconds set by Zusa in the semi-final.</p>
<p>(1) Széchy (Hungary) 57.6 seconds</p>
<p>(2) Yusa Masanori (Japan) 57.9 seconds</p>
<p>(3) Arai Shigeo (Japan) 58 seconds</p>
<p>(4) Taguchi Masaharu (Japan) 58.1 seconds</p>
<p>(5) Fisscher (Germany) 59.3 seconds</p>
<p>(6) Fick (USA) 59.7 seconds</p>

<h3>(VI)(X) Two Major Battles of Basketball in the Fourth Week</h3>
<p>As the Games basketball competition entered its fourth week, only eight teams remained, divided into four groups for competition. Among them, the most attention was naturally focused on the United States versus the Philippines and Canada versus Uruguay (the other two groups were Mexico defeating Italy 34-17, and Poland defeating Peru, Peru surrendering). These two matches were moved to the large basketball court. The United States versus the Philippines was at 5:00 PM, and Canada versus Uruguay was at 6:00 PM. However, Europeans' interest in basketball was not as enthusiastic as in other sports, so there were only a thousand spectators for these two exciting battles.</p>
<p>The United States Team Thoroughly Defeats the Philippines</p>
<p>The United States is the birthplace of basketball and has excellent skills, which goes without saying. However, the Philippines has long been the hegemon of the Far East, and its strength should not be underestimated. Although the outcome of the game was largely determined before the start, it was generally believed that the Philippines would pose a great threat to the United States. Indeed, in the first half, the Philippine team fought with all its might and was only eight points behind. In the second half, the US team relied on its tall stature and quick movements to put on a spectacular performance. The Philippine team was unable to retaliate and was completely defeated.</p>
<p>At the referee's command, the two teams lined up facing the center circle. The American center, Fodenbree, was six feet tall, while the Philippine player, Macson, was a head shorter. The American team had the advantage in the center jump. After two or three passes, the left guard, Huiz Wanlai, charged into the Philippine camp and raised his hand, sending the ball straight through the net to open the scoring. Fodenbree's long shot missed, but the right forward, Johnson, rushed up and tapped the ball in for another score. The Philippine team got the ball and launched a counterattack. The left forward, Burke, tried his skills under the basket and scored. Fodenbree rebounded under the basket as easily as reaching into a bag and lightly put the ball in. Six to two, the US team took the lead. After Knowles and Martinez each scored one point for their respective teams from free throws, Fodenbree and Johnson scored again, making it eleven to three, further widening the gap. The Philippine team launched a desperate counterattack. After Martinez scored on a free throw, Padiera and Macson successively broke through the final defense line and pulled back four points. Burke missed two free throws, which was a big blow. In contrast, the American team's morale was doubled, and they fought more and more bravely. Huiz Tolai showed his skills, and Fodenbree was also accurate from a distance. Although Padiera sneaked in a goal in the American camp, Swanson made two decisive long shots, making it nineteen to ten. The Philippine army changed its strategy, passing the ball on the ground, making it difficult for the American army to bend down. Burke and Padiera broke through the net twice, and the American army hurriedly replaced Shi Huangsheng with Lageran, making the back line more stable. The three forwards emerged in the enemy's camp, with a strong momentum. The Philippine team struggled to follow, indomitable. At halftime, the Americans narrowly won 28 to 20. In the break, the Philippine team's physical strength was insufficient and it had become exhausted, while the Americans had more than enough strength and became braver and braver. The defense was as solid as a golden wall, and the front line was like entering an uninhabited land. With continuous penalties and scores, they added nine points. Only then did Martinez score one point for the Philippine team with a free throw. After that, the American army bombarded continuously, adding thirteen points, directly causing the Philippine team to be dizzy and unable to resist. Burke worked hard to steal a goal under the basket, but Johnson and Knowles repeatedly crushed it.

<h3>The Securities and Government Bond Market is Listless</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange was still exceptionally dull. Although there were changes in the environment, the bond market remained unresponsive. As in the past, there were times of stagnation and hovering, but it was always said that the situation was stable and there were no changes. Now that the situation is changing so drastically, and the bond market is so dull, the reasons for this situation will inevitably be revealed in the near future. Based on the decreasing number of dependency accounts, it is speculated that the future will be increasingly bleak. Retail speculation and investment are not enough to prosper the market. The whole day's trading yesterday was extremely quiet, setting a new record for the most recent days. In the morning, the two sessions totaled only 610,000, and in the afternoon, only 1.1 million. The market price fluctuations were still hovering between 0.05 and 0.1 yuan. In each session, there were definitely one or two kinds with absolutely no one consulting. The market sentiment has been extremely dissipated. As a result, the market price improved slightly by 0.05 to 0.15 yuan. The total number of transactions was only 1.71 million. The comparison list of the increase and decrease results is as follows: (Unit: Yuan, Transaction Unit: 100 Yuan)</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Short Covering is Very Urgent Recently; The Yarn Market Has Become Inverted; A Recent New High Price of 204.5 Yuan Was Discovered</h3>
<p>The yarn market fell in the morning and rose in the afternoon, with a strong momentum. The recent rise in the market is very strong, mainly because the amount of yarn in warehouses is gradually decreasing, already within 30,000 bales. Therefore, the short positions are actively covering, and the market price is steadily increasing, discovering the highest new price since recently. However, the overseas yarn and cotton situation has turned weaker.</p>
<p>This Month Increased Again by 1.5 Yuan</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened in the morning, with slight declines in each month. This was because the American cotton yarn and cotton market was flat, and the spot yarn business turned quiet. The market sentiment was mediocre, and the market was not active. After the second session, there were no major changes. The longs Mingde, Hengchang, Xincheng, and Xingchang did not sell. The shorts Huamao, Changfeng, Xiecheng, Tonghe, and Yongchang covered a lot. As a result, the spot yarn market fell by 0.3, 0.5, 0.6, and 0.7 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon market opened, and the market was tight. This was because the amount of yarn in warehouses was shrinking, and it was rumored that a certain merchant was increasingly short covering in the near month. Therefore, the buying interest was extremely strong, and the market price rose step by step. As a result, each month rose by 1.4, 1.5, 1.6 to 2 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Dada sold 2300 bales, Dafu sold 1,750 bales, Chang sold 1,000 bales, and Chang sold 1,400 bales. Mingde sold 1,750 bales, Chang sold 1,000 bales, Hengchang sold 1,100 bales, Xincheng sold 1,000 bales, Yudda sold 1,000 bales, Jinchang sold 1,300 bales, and Changfeng sold 1,200 bales.

<h3>Metals   British Steel Plate Scarcity Causes Prices to Soar</h3>
<p>Recently, British steel plates have been scarce in the market, with few shipments arriving from overseas. However, demand from customers and manufacturers has increased, leading to a shortage. Prices have therefore soared. For example, 2.5mm plates are selling for $10, 5mm for $8.50, 7.5mm for $8, 10mm for $7.50, and thick patterned plates for $7.12, an increase of 40-50 cents compared to previous market prices.

<h3>Sudden Tightening of Buying Sentiment in Afternoon Market Causes Cotton Prices to Rise</h3>
<p>Initially, the cotton market saw a downward trend due to clear weather and weakness in foreign cotton prices. However, rumors circulated that prices were high in various production areas, with reports of a two-dollar price surge for Ningbo Yao cotton. Consequently, short sellers rushed to cover their positions, causing market prices to rebound.</p>
<h3>Spot Cotton Prices Rise by Another Four Jiao</h3>
<p>In the early market for spot cotton, prices initially rose following the rise in US cotton, but then fell. The result was mixed, fluctuating between one and nine points. Indian cotton fell by 1.25 rupees, and Osaka's Sanpin cotton fell by 0.34 jiao. The local weather cleared up with a cool breeze, dampening sentiment somewhat. Buying interest in the market was not strong, and prices for all months fell by 0.23 jiao. However, floating traders covered their positions later, causing prices to fluctuate by 0.05 to 0.10 jiao. Chengji, Dafu, Yuda, Mingde, Gengfeng, Xingchang, Tonghe, and Shengyuan all sold, while Changhe made a strong effort to buy 10,000 dan. Runkang, Yongchang, Dafeng, Changfeng, and Xincheng covered shorts and increased positions. As a result, prices for all months fell by 0.23 jiao compared to the previous day's close. The afternoon market opened with extremely tight conditions. Rumors that a certain bank's general manager was about to assume an important financial position spurred a rush to buy, driving prices up across the board. As a result, prices for all months rose by 0.55 to 0.65 jiao compared to the morning close. Chengji sold 10,000 dan, Dafu 9,000 dan, Deda 3,400 dan, Shenji 3,300 dan, Taichang 4,500 dan, Xincheng 3,800 dan, Yichang 2,600 dan, Xingchang 2,600 dan, Shengyuan 2,400 dan, and Tonghe 3,100 dan. Fukang bought 5,000 dan, Dachang 2,500 dan, Dafeng 2,300 dan, Dachangcheng 4,700 dan, Runkang 8,400 dan, Yongchang 3,100 dan, Changhe 10,500 dan, Hexing 3,000 dan, Fengtai 4,200 dan, and Renfeng 5,000 dan. The highest and lowest prices of the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Cotton Merchants Hoarding, Transactions Gradually Decreasing</p>
<p>The consumption of spot cotton is mediocre. Holders are asking for prices that are too high, making it difficult for buyers and sellers to agree. 3,200 bales of Yao cotton arrived, with an asking price of 34.20 yuan.</p>
<p>Lingbao Cotton 58.25 Yufeng Factory Purchase 170 pieces Delivery to factory in October/November</p>
<p>Lingbao Cotton 55.50 Yufeng Factory Purchase 173 pieces Spot delivery to factory</p>
<p>Lingbao Cotton 55.75 Yufeng Factory Purchase 65 pieces Spot delivery to factory</p>
<h3>Local Stocks of Chinese and Japanese Yarn Sharply Reduced by Over 14,000 Bales</h3>
<p>A certain cotton industry organization in this port investigated the yarn inventory of Chinese and Japanese factories in Shanghai as of the end of August. The inventory of Japanese yarn was 3,742 bales, and the inventory of Chinese yarn was 54,425 bales, totaling 58,167 bales. This is a decrease of 14,016 bales compared to the 72,183 bales at the end of July, with Japanese yarn decreasing by 946 bales and Chinese yarn decreasing by 13,070 bales. The breakdown of yarn inventory is recorded below (unit: bales):</p>
<p>(Note: The more than 30,000 bales of 20-count yarn stored in the Yarn and Fabric Exchange warehouse are also included in the calculation.)</p>
<h3>US Cotton Market Prices Nearly Firm in the Near Term, Weak in the Long Term</h3>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton opened with prices ranging from unchanged to up two points. Early in the morning, due to cotton farmers selling short at the previous day's close, trading was hesitant. Later, due to buying by dealers and Liverpool, prices rose. Short positions in near-term months were mostly shifted to long-term months, resulting in near-term firmness and long-term weakness. Before the close, increased short selling led to a gradual correction. The market is currently quiet, and the close was stable. Spot prices were unchanged, while futures prices fell by nine points to up three points. English spot cotton fell by four points, and futures fell by 12 points. The liquidation of long positions in Indian cotton was absorbed by short covering. Later, cotton merchants bought across different months, which was then overturned by the liquidation of long positions. Pingguoer fell by 1.25 rupees, Aomula fell by one rupee, and Bairoxi fell by 1.25 rupees. Original telegrams are recorded on the left (dated the 11th):</p>
<p>Pingguoer 157.75 Down 1.25 18.80</p>
<p>Aomula 196.00 Down 1.00 35.20</p>
<p>Bairoxi 118.75 Down 1.25 39.80</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for the 11th was: Bairoxi at 218.5 rupees, down 0.25 rupees; Aomula at 196 rupees, unchanged from the previous day; and Pingguoer at 158 rupees, up 0.25 rupees.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cotton Both Fall: Telegram from Osaka on the 11th. Sanpin futures yarn fell by 0.60 to 1.20 yuan, with near-term at 215 yuan and long-term at 203.8 yuan. Futures cotton fell by 0.15 to 0.35 jiao, with near-term at 66.6 yuan and long-term at 64.45 yuan.</p>
<h3>Grains: Some Outside Buying Interest, Flour Prices Initially Decline then Rebound</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the flour market, prices for all months were generally flat after the morning opening. Although quoted prices for imported wheat saw a slight improvement, actual sales in the northern routes remained sluggish. Therefore, trading was sideways. Compared to the previous day's closing price, prices fell by about 0.075 yuan. The afternoon opening saw little movement initially, but later, due to outside buying interest, there was a slight increase in buying. Factory hedging was also largely on the sidelines. Therefore, although trading was not brisk, asking prices rose by nearly a full yuan. Industry insiders speculate that if northern sales remain as sluggish as usual during the current peak sales season, and factories accumulate inventory, there may be downward pressure in the near future.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Quiet Initially, Afternoon Slightly Better Due to Buying by Hankou Dealers</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market was quiet as usual during the morning opening. Few asking prices showed any improvement, and were roughly the same as the previous day. During the afternoon opening, however, trading was more active and buying interest increased. It was rumored that dealers from Hankou were buying because wheat prices there had risen. Standard wheat saw a slight increase in buying, and sentiment strengthened slightly, improving by 0.01 yuan compared to the previous day. Current wheat prices remained stable, and factory demand was relatively weak. Prices were quoted as follows: Kaiming Guangwu River wheat at 4.95 yuan, Zhuzhen wheat at 4.76 yuan, Suqian wheat at 4.86 yuan (discount of 0.082 yuan), Jiangbei wheat at 4.77 yuan (secondary grade at 4.63 yuan), Jiangjiaba wheat at 4.83 yuan (discount of 0.08 yuan), Gaoyou wheat at 4.7224 yuan, Wuyi wheat at 4.83 yuan, Nanjing wheat at 4.75 yuan, Yaowan wheat at 4.89 yuan, and Taizhou wheat at 4.78 yuan. Fuxin bought 3,000 bags, Fufeng bought 1,500 bags, and Shenda bought 1,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Ke Xian Initially Weak then Stable, Guangdong Dealers Stop Buying While Shantou Continues Strongly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, arrivals of Ke Xian rice remained strong. New arrivals from Sha, Han, Xiang, and Gan totaled 20,000 bags, while existing inventory in the market reached over 100,000 bags. Due to ample supply from production areas and continuous arrivals, the market was inherently weak. Guangdong dealers were buying actively, which helped support the market. Yesterday, however, Guangdong dealers stopped buying because their previous orders had not yet been fully loaded, and due to tonnage and market price considerations. The market became soft and listless again, and prices seemed to be trending downward. Fortunately, Shantou dealers continued to buy actively, and local buying interest was also strong, which helped support the market. Local dealers also responded by selling 600-700 bags of coarse rice. The market stabilized in a weak position. A total of 4,720 bags of Jiangxi rice, 3,453 bags of Xiang rice, 300 bags of Han coarse rice, and 250 bags of Taiwan Xian rice were sold throughout the day.</p>
<h3>He Xia Rice Market Remains Weak as Before</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, arrivals from various dealers increased compared to the previous day, totaling over 5,000 shi (a unit of dry measure) from 25-26 sources. However, local sales were sluggish. Although Qingdao and Dalian dealers bought over 500 bags, the market was still difficult to maintain. Prices for thick and thin Japonica rice fell slightly. Although arrivals of Dongxin Japonica rice were not strong, the 5 shi of newly arrived Kunshan rice in the northern market inevitably had an impact, lowering prices by 0.1 yuan. Du Yang and other newly harvested varieties saw weaker sales and shorter measurements. The Yin variety was mediocre.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were 34-35 arrivals from various sources in He Xia. Sales of cheaper varieties were slightly better, while prices for high-quality broken Japonica rice were weak and unchanged. New West Japonica rice was down by 0.1-0.2 yuan, Dongxin Japonica rice was down by 0.1 yuan, Chen Yangjian rice was down slightly. The Bianyuan variety was stable. New Yangjian rice was up slightly, Xin Tuanjian rice was up slightly, and Xin Bujien rice was down by 0.1-0.2 yuan. Thin Indica rice was down by 0.1 yuan.</p>
<p>Fuxin bought 3,000 bags, Fufeng bought 1,500 bags, and Shenda bought 1,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchants Actively Buying Rapeseed Causes Prices to Rise Sharply: Secondary Grade Soybeans Still in Demand by Factories</h3>
<p>Rapeseed trading has a new outlet in Japan. The market was not expected to develop significantly, but recently, due to the rise in prices of all kinds of oil raw materials, rapeseed has become an important commodity for that country. Therefore, buying interest has been very strong, and market prices have been rising steadily. Earlier this month, Pinghu rapeseed rose from 9.89 yuan to 10.01 yuan, with over 2,000 bags traded. Yesterday, prices rose again to 10.02 yuan, with 1,000 bags traded. Currently, only a small amount of Pinghu rapeseed is available on the market, so the price increase remains quite sharp. New soybeans saw balanced arrivals and sales, and prices were largely unchanged. A total of over 3,700 bags of various soybeans were sold. High-quality beans commanded high prices, so factories only bought middle- to upper-grade beans. The future trend is currently difficult to predict.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: First Batch of New Xinghua Longan Arrives, Over 3,000 Pieces; Shizhuang Goods Plunge by Six Yuan</h3>
<p>Recently, arrivals of new longan have been increasing gradually. The first batch of new Xinghua longan also arrived yesterday, with over 3,000 boxes. Therefore, quoted prices tended to soften, falling by varying amounts of 2-3 yuan. Over 1,600 boxes were traded. At the same time, in order to promote sales, dealers reduced the prices of Shizhuang goods, such as Dingji Tianji Tianhong, by six yuan across the board. It is said that sun-dried longan pulp also fell by about three yuan.</p>
<p>Xu Kuizi in Short Supply, Prices Rise Again by Four Jiao: A New North Goods Store Opens... Chen Da</p>
<p>Recently, Xu Kuizi has been in short supply in production areas, leading to repeated price increases in the market. Prices rose again by 0.04 yuan recently, reaching 18.20 yuan. Premium-grade Zhuangzi was priced at over 19 yuan. Small packages also saw prices rise in tandem. Industry sources report that Li Nifeng, the former manager of Houde, has newly established a large North Goods store named Chen Da. The store is located on Yanghang Street, at the original site of Houde.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Zhenji Refined White Sugar Down Slightly by 0.1 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trended stable. The association's quoted price for spot No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar fell slightly by 0.05 yuan to 21.55 yuan, with some transactions. Transshipment goods were quoted up by 0.05 yuan, but no deals were made. High-grade Zhuang was priced at 6.6 yuan, ordinary grade at 6.55 yuan, and Dongbai No. 4 trademark transshipment goods at 6.3 yuan, and No. 8 at 6.1 yuan, all seeing slight increases. Zhenji refined white sugar from local factories was down slightly by 0.1 yuan, with No. 1 at 20.4 yuan, No. 2 at 20 yuan, No. 3 at 19.6 yuan, No. 4 at 19.2 yuan, and No. 5 at 18.8 yuan. There was a batch of wet brown sugar from the Chaozhou dealers, with Jisheng, Juyuan, and Maoye totaling over 170 bags at 15.1 yuan, Hechang and Zhangyi totaling 96 bags at 15 yuan, secondary grade Zhi 54 bags at 14.85 yuan, and Fuquanyang 40 bags at 18.1 yuan flat.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the third bidding session of the week for sugar from joint-stock companies. The total quota was 8,365 bags. Bidding prices were largely unchanged, except for high-quality sugar from Quxi Factory, which was bid up by 0.1 yuan but failed to sell. ShunDe Factory's Wuyang coarse white sugar sold 1,305 bags at 21.4 yuan, Quxi Factory sold another 220 bags at 20.7 yuan, Shixin Factory sold another 135 bags at 21.2 yuan, and medium granulated white sugar sold 70 bags at 19.3 yuan. A total of 1,730 bags were traded.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Market Gradually Firming</h3>
<p>Yesterday, overseas silk markets saw consistent gains again. However, silk trading was still not enthusiastic. According to Reuters, the number of transactions on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday was 340 bales, with spot prices up 1.5 points and futures prices up one point. New York's Japanese silk asking prices rose by two points, while Chinese silk was unchanged. Yokohama spot prices rose by 12 yuan, and futures prices rose by 2 yuan. Lyon's Japanese silk rose by 0.50 francs, Guangdong silk rose by 1 franc, and Shanghai silk remained at the original price. Yesterday, British, French, and New York firms in this port all saw some transactions. However, because manufacturers' sentiment turned firm, asking prices rose by about 20 yuan compared to the previous day, causing the silk market to gradually firm. A total of 310 bales were sold for both domestic and foreign sales yesterday. Silk asking prices were generally up by 10-20 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Women Should Strive for Equal Opportunities to Serve in Society</h3>
<p>— Zhenhua</p>
<p>Since the rise of the women's movement, women in all aspects of society have gained some benefits. However, because the atmosphere of fascism is becoming increasingly prevalent, and because the entire society's politics and economy are in a state of recession, the women's movement has also stagnated imperceptibly.</p>
<p>Women's demand for liberation and achieving equal status with men requires, as a first step, achieving equality in education and economics. This is a problem that everyone knows and is without doubt. However, if we obtain inheritance rights to property, possessing ample money; we acquire equal educational opportunities, creating advanced knowledge, but society does not allow us to utilize it, to practice it, then what use is something that we exchanged for after much effort and difficulty to us? Are we willing to lightly throw away what we have fought for? No, this is absolutely impossible. We should obtain equal opportunities for men and women to serve in society, and contribute what we have gained to society, so that all of humanity can be happy because of us.</p>
<p>However, things are not as easy as imagined, because with the increase in the number of unemployed, female employees who have just stepped onto the path of service, occupying the positions of male employees, they have to cry that women's work is like a vase, only for decoration. Of course, we cannot protect ourselves and absolutely oppose other people's criticisms, but we absolutely do not believe that every male employee has abundant knowledge? Able to serve loyally.</p>
<p>Sisters, we should understand that equality between men and women? It is by no means empty slogans that can be successful, we must use practical methods to fulfill it. Therefore, in society, we have to demand equality of opportunity for men and women to serve! To break the shackles of that parasitic life. But how do we obtain this equality? I think everything in the world is man-made, as long as everyone is willing to make up their minds, there is no reason why they cannot do it. Here are two points written down on my personal views.</p>
<p>(1) Cultivate a practical spirit. The success of a person depends entirely on persevering along a foolish path: opportunistic success is accidental and risky. Therefore, in the age of seeking, we cultivate a practical spirit, to acquire real knowledge, so that after academic achievement we can be employed by society, and when serving, we adhere to a practical spirit, and work hard, then, will we be dismissed?</p>
<p>(2) Get rid of flashy and vain decoration. Flashy and vain decoration not only consumes time and wastes money, but also easily provokes people's aversion and creates a psychology of contempt.</p>
<p>The two points mentioned above are not harsh demands. If we can do it, I believe that equal opportunities for men and women in social services can definitely be achieved and can last forever.</p>
<h3>Biographies of Famous Women in the World (3)</h3>
<p>— Lusha Bai</p>
<p>Varvara Yakovleva, who was as famous as Kollontai and served as the Soviet People's Commissar for Finance, was born in Moscow. She was a quiet and taciturn person with an amiable personality, completely different from Kollontai's outstanding and unrestrained character. She joined the party in 1904 and was arrested in 1910, sentenced to four years of exile. She escaped halfway and fled abroad. Two years later, she sneaked back into the country; in 1913, she was arrested again and exiled to Arkhangelsk for three years. She was also arrested and imprisoned several times in Moscow; it is rare to find a woman who has always fought to the end like her.</p>
<p>She was not as good at rhetoric as ordinary politicians, nor did she indulge in empty talk. She only knew how to immerse herself in practical work. Therefore, during her five years in office, she was able to abide by her duties and was highly trusted by the people of the country.</p>
<p>Nikolaeva came from a female worker in a bookbinding factory, and Alexandra Ardyutina rose from an apprentice in a tailoring shop to the head of the women's department of the Party Central Committee. She grew up in a poor family. Her mother was an uneducated textile worker. She only received elementary education at the age of ten, and then dropped out of school due to poverty to help her mother with work.</p>
<p>She spent her youth in this dim factory, completely isolated from all the joys of life and material enjoyment that life should have. Gnawing on black bread every day, she harbored a rebellious determination towards this accursed society. Different from intellectuals such as Kollontai and Yakovleva, she did not start from theory, but participated in the movement from her real life. She was elected as a cadre of the Petersburg Trade Union, and at the age of twenty, she had become an important party member. Before the October Revolution, she was arrested and imprisoned and sentenced to exile. Unlike ordinary women, who are full of sentimentality, the poor life in her childhood and the terrifying life of exile after participating in the revolution, tempered her into an iron-like character. There was no such thing as a woman's coquettishness or love between men and women in her at all.</p>
<p>A person with such a character can of course be regarded as a hero in troubled times, but when the Soviet Union entered the second five-year plan and social life had become relatively stable, a person like her had lost the meaning of her existence. She was elected as an alternate member of the Central People's Committee and the head of the women's department, and later promoted to the head of the women's department, but it has now been abolished. Her political status is also declining day by day.</p>

<h3>A Type of French Human Figure in Japanese New Women's Side Jobs</h3>
<p>— Hair</p>
<p>Japan was originally famous for making toys. When Japanese women have nothing to do at home, they make cloth foreign babies for their younger siblings to play with. The recently popular French portraits were learned from France. After research and improvement, it will become a unique Japanese toy again. At first, it was only for children to play with. Later, the manufacturing became exquisite and the materials became expensive. It has become a decoration for family rooms and a decoration for large store windows. The sales are very large, and the manufacturers have an income of two to three hundred yuan per month, so it has become a type of side job for new women in Japan.</p>
<p>The faces, hands and feet of ordinary foreign babies are not made of celluloid, but of porcelain clay, which is easy to break, dull and lifeless. And they are all made with complex machines, which are difficult to imitate in the family. The currently popular French portraits are all made of thin silk and colored satin. They are usually stored in wooden glass boxes, so they will remain intact for thousands of years.</p>
<p>The face of the human figure is the most difficult to manufacture. A thin piece of flesh-colored or white silk is pasted on several layers of gauze, and when it is damp, it is pressed in an iron mold. After drying, it becomes a beautiful oval face. The ears, nose, mouth and eyes are all painted with colors, so it is possible to imitate photos and draw all kinds of different faces. Most of them use movie stars and actresses as models. The model of a girl is of course the most lovely Shirley Temple. The size of the face is related to the length of the whole body, so there are many types of faces, which can be manufactured arbitrarily. The faces sold in stores range from 78 jiao to 12 yuan each. It is convenient and economical to manufacture them yourself at home.</p>
<p>The hair is made of raw silk, dyed in various colors, and can also be permed into curly waves. The limbs, hands, feet and body are also made of flesh-colored or white thin silk, with cotton stuffed in the middle, so they can be full and plump. Supported by various lead wires, a graceful curve is created. There is no definite standard for clothing decoration, and everything can be arranged as you like. This kind of French portrait was originally in the shape of foreign women, but now it can be changed into Japanese costumes, with high buns and kimonos, dragging a pair of small wooden exhibitions, which is quite interesting. If it is changed again into Chinese costumes, with short hair and cheongsam, I think it will definitely become popular in China. The basic method is the same, and it can be manufactured by any nation, regardless of gender or age.</p>
<p>The face, limbs and all the clothing, hats, shoes and ornaments of the human figure are all sold retail. If you can't make it yourself, you can buy the parts and assemble them yourself. And large companies hold lectures on a regular basis to teach methods, so more and more people are learning and becoming women's side jobs. The price of French human figures ranges from two or three yuan to several hundred yuan, and most of them are used for interior decoration and gifts. After being used as window decorations by stores, people passing by will stop to watch.</p>
<h3>Women's Life on the Beach</h3>
<p>— Mani</p>
<p>There are various opinions on the women's question in the current society. One says that women always rely on men, one says that men and women should share the burden of life, and another says that women should return to the family. I don't dare to talk nonsense about which problem is good. I don't want women to be used by merchants as commercial gimmicks, and I don't want women to rush to shovel five hundred times after returning to the family after dinner. Let's talk about women's life on the beach.</p>
<p>The women on the coast of the Yellow Sea are very miserable. Their husbands are mostly salt makers and fishermen. The living expenses they get are pitiful. How can they take care of their wives and children's food and drink? Most of the food is filled with sweet potato flour. Although their lives are so difficult, they don't complain about heaven or others. Because there are abundant aquatic products in the sea, they squat on the beach every day to pick fresh goods. It is said that "they can get four hundred texts a day. Because there are many children in the family, and men only earn a few hundred texts a day, so we do some easy work to supplement our lives."</p>
<p>It is also rare for women to voluntarily help their husbands in production like this, and their husbands do not have permanent jobs, but they can work all year round without stopping. Even in the autumn flood season, every time jellyfish are produced, there is no need to pick fresh ones, but cotton is planted in the fields, and people are needed to remove grass. So they hold iron shovels and rake grass under strong heat, and can get two yuan a day. Families with difficult lives can get subtle help, which is also a small supplement. Living by labor is not to starve. These women do not know a single word, and their minds are very simple. Moreover, in extremely difficult environments, selling labor to supplement their husbands' lives is a bit more meaningful than women in cities who only know how to eat, drink, and decorate themselves.</p>

<h3>Marriage Customs in Abyssinia (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Wei Jing</p>
<p>Under the marriage system in Abyssinia, women have absolutely no right to choose their own destiny. A woman's marriage rights are entirely determined by her father. Once a father has promised his daughter to someone, it is as if he has already determined his daughter's fate, and he absolutely does not consider his daughter's wishes. One or two days before the daughter's marriage, the bride's father is required to prepare a feast. This feast usually consists of large amounts of raw beef, marinated mutton cooked in soy sauce, a mixture of oatmeal and butter, unleavened bread, etc. Among these items, strongly alcoholic drinks are usually added. While the bride's family is hosting such a grand banquet for the guests, the groom's relatives and friends are also enjoying the same banquet.</p>
<p>On the wedding day, the groom, accompanied by relatives and friends, rides a mule to the bride's house. To show their arrival, they must fire a volley of guns and perform a war dance. After that, they enter the bride's house in a large group. There, the bride's entire family (except for the bride), as well as relatives and friends, are waiting. After the groom arrives at the bride's house, the bride's family must prepare a seat for him. This seat is usually under an umbrella made of green grass. After taking his seat, the bride's family invites the groom to a feast (the dishes are similar to those mentioned above). After the feast, the relatives and friends who came with the groom must fire another volley of guns and perform another war dance. Then, the bride, wearing a long robe and a white thick cloth mask, is led in by the bridesmaids and sits on a pre-arranged long orange, listening quietly to her father reporting the dowry he is giving her. This dowry usually consists of livestock, furniture, farm tools, etc.</p>
<p>After the bride's father finishes his report, the groom and bride stand side by side under the umbrella, and the bride's father asks the groom if he is willing to take his daughter as his wife. The groom hooks his little finger with the bride's little finger, which signifies his willingness. The simple marriage is then completed. Next is the pastor's blessing. If a pastor cannot be found at the time, the blessing is performed by an older relative. After the blessing, dancing follows. Then the bride rides a mule to the groom's house, where another simple ceremony is held.</p>

<h3>Ms. Deng Yuzhi Discusses Labor Welfare</h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>In modern industrialized nations, there are sophisticated and comprehensive facilities for labor welfare. For example, if a certain industry only seeks short-term profits and ignores the safety, health, and hygiene of its workers, the result will inevitably be mutually destructive. China's industry cannot compare with industrialized countries, so labor welfare is also far behind. As the saying goes, "A rising tide lifts all boats," it may be premature to talk about how to handle these labor issues for the time being. However, everyone should understand the current situation of Chinese workers. I discussed this issue with Ms. Deng Yuzhi, who has been serving in the Labor Department of the National Association of Chinese Christian Women's Associations for ten years, and her remarks provide a glimpse into the situation.</p>
<p>Before discussing this topic, I must first introduce Ms. Deng's brief history to give readers an understanding. She is from Changsha, Hunan. After graduating from the Sociology Department of Ginling Women's College, she worked as a staff member in the Student Department of the Association. In less than three years, she was transferred to the Labor Department. In 1929, the Association sent her to Japan, Europe, and the United States to study labor welfare, with special attention to welfare work in the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, Japan, and Switzerland. She spent five months and obtained a lot of valuable information. At that time, she wrote a lengthy report, but it was not published publicly. Upon arriving in England, she studied at the London School of Economics for another year and then returned to her original position. She has a thorough understanding of labor welfare and speaks frankly about it. I know readers will be very moved.</p>
<p>She said: "The labor conditions of various countries that I will discuss are from six years ago, but according to recent survey reports, there have been no major changes except in Germany, so I am bringing up old matters again: (1) At that time, Japanese labor unions were already very active, and their organizations were well-structured. The general education level of workers was higher than that of Chinese workers. The labor welfare provided by employers was not much different from that in the United Kingdom and the United States, such as worker relief, entertainment, food and lodging subsidies, education, etc., which were quite effective. (2) American labor unions were previously divided into two factions: one was the A.F.L., which consisted entirely of American-born workers, was conservative in its thinking, and discriminated against foreign workers, including Chinese workers. The other was the I.W.W., which treated foreign workers equally, was well-organized internally, and provided many educational, entertainment, and relief services for workers. Generally speaking, welfare services in American labor unions are divided into two types: one is organized by the factory, and the other is self-organized by the workers. The former stabilizes the lives of workers, eliminates the need to organize labor unions, reduces the consciousness of confrontation between labor and capital, and disperses the organizational strength of workers. The latter involves workers with higher intelligence who manage all welfare services themselves and do not want to be manipulated by employers in a planned manner. Both have their advantages and disadvantages. American industry is particularly developed, so worker welfare is better than in other countries. (3) At that time, German labor unions were very large. They ran their own newspapers and schools, from elementary school to university, which were very complete. Later, the political system changed, and now the power of the labor unions is controlled by the National Socialist Party, so the situation is certainly different now. I also examined the implementation of the British Factory Act. Their labor union organization is very strict, and worker education and training are no less than in the United States, but workers are not as active as in the United States, which shows the different national characteristics of the two countries.</p>
<p>Here, I want to talk about worker welfare in China, which can be divided into several points: (1) In China, it can be said that very few worker welfare programs are organized from the perspective of workers' own interests. Of course, we cannot compare with foreign countries. Foreign labor unions do not belong to any political party. Labor unions are a means of economic struggle for workers, such as fighting for wages and working hours, but they cannot escape political activities. (2) Everyone believes that implementing worker education and improving workers' intellectual level is an urgent matter, but the question of who should organize worker education is worth studying. In England, it is a third party in society, especially scholars who are enthusiastic about worker education, who organize worker education. In capitalist society, worker education is best done in England. You can talk to every worker about international issues or political issues, and they can answer well. I think even a middle school student would probably find it difficult. China now really needs a third party in society (neither the government nor the workers) to organize worker education. (3) Working hours in Chinese factories are longer than in any country. The usual is ten to twelve hours, and the treatment is very poor. Don't even mention education; even their health is not good. Their energy and time do not allow them to be baptized by education. Now the government wants to implement the Factory Act and reduce working hours, which is one of the important prerequisites. (4) Male workers suffer, but female workers suffer even more. According to statistics on workers in various industries, there are more female workers than male workers, and married female workers have household chores in addition to factory work. They often reduce their sleep time to complete their daily tasks. When it comes to before and after childbirth, they cannot take much leave, which makes them feel even more pain. In this situation, political power should be used to urge factories to run nurseries and extend maternity leave before and after childbirth, but this may not be easy to do, because factories also have their own difficulties, which makes them feel that employing female workers is a loss. As things stand, female workers themselves do not have healthy lives, which affects the physical condition of their children, which is a very serious problem. From the standpoint of the nation and the people, we cannot just let it pass. Because workers make up the largest majority of urban residents, if the workers' families are all unhealthy, the loss is terribly great. Disease is originally a painful thing in life, but the pain of poor and sick workers can be imagined. In a city as big as Shanghai, there are no free or reduced-fee hospitals at all. Even if there are one or two public hospitals, only people with connections can get treatment. Poor people can forget about getting in. When workers get sick, their wages are stopped, which is already a loss, but household expenses increase, and they also have to pay medical expenses, so in fact they cannot wait long. Therefore, sick workers suffer from mental and material pressure, so often a small illness becomes a major illness, a major illness becomes death, and some people relapse after their first recovery due to overwork, which is so heartbreaking! I am one of the people who are closest to female workers. Usually what I hear and see are these things, which makes me feel helpless and extremely difficult. In addition, worker unemployment is also a very important issue, so I feel that everything about labor is not a simple issue, especially in the current stage of China, which needs to be resolved urgently!"</p>
<h3>Requesting Guidance on Birth Control</h3>
<p>— Chengzi</p>
<p>I have been unemployed for almost a year because of having children.</p>
<p>After the child was born, I dared not delay any longer on the issue of how to practice birth control.</p>
<p>Accidentally, I saw at the registration desk of the hospital that the Gynecology Department had a section for guiding childbirth and controlling childbirth, the time for which was every Thursday afternoon. That day happened to be my shift, so I registered and went to the waiting room to request guidance on how to control childbirth.</p>
<p>There were already many people sitting in the waiting room. I didn't know if they were all there to receive education on birth control methods. When my number was called, I was called in. A girl, probably a female intern from the medical school, led me to a room inside and began to ask about my menstrual cycle, number of births, etc. I told her that everything was fine, and that it had only been three months since I gave birth to my last child. She looked at me with a look of surprise and said: "You don't want to have children? Well, wait outside for a while, the doctor hasn't come yet." As she spoke, she took another examination form and called another name. I followed her out, and many people's eyes were focused on me, as if they wanted to inquire about the news inside, but I didn't satisfy them, and I quietly sat down among them.</p>
<p>After that, one by one went in and out, but it wasn't my turn. After waiting for about two hours, my name was called again. A boy - I probably didn't insult him, because he didn't look like a doctor at all, although he was wearing a white coat - told me to sit down and began to ask me the reason why I wanted to practice birth control, and then asked me about my family situation and financial situation, which were all filled in on a form. After filling it out, he smiled at me and said: "You sit outside for a while, and I'll call you in later." It seemed that all the conditions for birth control had been met, which made me very happy. I happily ran back outside again.</p>
<p>Before long, I was called in again. This time I saw a doctor, who asked me briefly about the reason why I didn't want to have children, and then led me into the examination room. He told me to lie down on the hospital bed. The hospital bed was very high. After I lay down, the boys and girls all gathered around to watch the doctor examine me. I was very scared. I felt like I was meat on a chopping block. The doctor gave physiological instructions to the students in a foreign language, and then taught me how to use a cervical cap. The so-called cervical cap was just a thin rubber thing like a small teacup. The method of use was very simple: just put the thing completely into the vagina. The doctor also wrote a prescription and told me to buy medicine, which was placed in the cervical cap when it was used. I climbed down from the hospital bed, and the doctors all walked outside. I stood alone and straightened my clothes. At this time, the nurse had already packed the cervical cap that had just been used, and also took another bottle of toothpaste-like tin tubes, and handed one to me, saying: "Take this, it's five yuan, and the medicine is another one yuan." I couldn't help but be stunned. I happened to have six yuan on me, but this six yuan was the living expenses for the second half of the month. I really didn't dare to give it to her rashly. (I heard that in countries where birth control is publicly available, the price of a cervical cap is only about two jiao.) I told her that I didn't bring that much money. She said! "Well, come and get it tomorrow." I said, "Okay." I felt very lost when I left the hospital.</p>
<p>In the evening, I told my husband about what happened during the day. He said: "Go and get it. You promised others, how can you not get it?"</p>
<p>But I hesitated. Six yuan is a large sum for me. The next day, I didn't go to get it after all. For a woman who dare not have children because she cannot afford to raise them, this contraceptive device is too expensive. I can only let the shadow of the second child heavily weigh on my head.</p>

<h3>Treatment for Underdeveloped Genitals, Premature Ejaculation, and Kidney Atrophy</h3>
<p>— (Translated by Dr. Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Expert)</p>
<p>Reprinted from the British Popular Medicine Magazine</p>
<p>Loss of vitality, lack of life interest! Decayed performance, difficult offspring!</p>
<p>With underdeveloped genitals, the patient's genitals are withered and small, like a child's. A sound sex life cannot be exercised, causing a husband to fail his duties, making it difficult to satisfy his wife's expectations, family happiness is lost, and offspring are even more impossible.</p>
<p>If this condition is not treated promptly, it will greatly affect health and longevity. Its harm is no less than premature ejaculation and impotence. Small genitals, premature ejaculation, and impotence are all symptoms of neurasthenia caused by the decline of the reproductive glands. If not treated early, it will lead to neurasthenia of the brain, neurasthenia of the spinal cord, and then various diseases will arise, and it will be even more difficult to save the situation.</p>
<p>In recent years, there have been many people suffering from the above three major venereal diseases. If treated with electrotherapy, practicing health preservation, and taking the famous venereal disease medicine "Reproductive Element", they can all get what they want and be cured quickly.</p>
<p>For those who have a history of nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, leukorrhea, etc., which lead to small genitals, premature ejaculation, and impotence, they should be thoroughly treated at the same time. "Hemitol's Sperm-Strengthening Tablets" are special medicines for treating nocturnal emission and spermatorrhea, and "Anti-Lymph" is an essential medicine for treating the five types of leukorrhea. Patients can treat themselves according to the law.</p>
<h3>Regaining Development After the Loss Caused by Masturbation</h3>
<p>— Dr. Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Tang, is twenty-seven years old, but his genitals are as small as a child's. Upon questioning, I learned that he had engaged in severe masturbation when he was young, which consumed too much energy, resulting in no development. His whole body was also thin and miserable. I immediately told him to purchase "Reproductive Element" from Wing On Company to cultivate and supplement his reproductive glands. His genitals immediately developed, and his muscles also became strong. Not only was his blood strong and his spirit sufficient, his weight was also strong, but his vitality was also re-emerged, returning to youth. Compared with the past, he was like a different person, no less than being reborn.</p>
<h3>Years of Stomach Pain Cured Once and For All</h3>
<p>— Dr. Wang Shiying</p>
<p>Patient Mr. He, is forty-nine years old. Mr. He used to serve in the navy, but in recent years he retired due to physical weakness. He lives in Xixian Aisilu. Last month was Mr. He's birthday, when Mr. He's stomach pain broke out. The guests were unhappy. He was introduced to me by a section chief. I immediately prescribed the famous stomach pain medicine "Stomach Pain Spirit" to treat the cause of his pain, and "Stomach-Strengthening Element" to nourish his sick stomach. After taking more than four boxes in a row, this old disease was cured quickly and thoroughly, and has not recurred for more than a month.</p>

<h3>Obtaining Beautiful Breasts and Hips</h3>
<p>— Dr. Liu Zhimin</p>
<p>Beauty-loving women, take note!</p>
<p>Western philosophers have said: "A woman is only truly beautiful when she is healthy!" From this, it can be known that being beautiful but not healthy is like a sick Xi Shi. How can this last forever? Only those who are healthy and beautiful have strong muscles, exposed curves, plump breasts, and high hips, which are in line with the modern standard of healthy beauty.</p>
<p>According to research, a woman's health and beauty can be judged by the development of her breasts, and the development of her breasts can be judged by the strength of her reproductive glands. The reproductive glands are not only directly related to offspring and menstruation, but also have a great influence on the mammary glands, youth, and beauty. Therefore, how to perfect the reproductive glands should be pursued and hoped for by women who want to obtain beauty.</p>
<p>The reproductive gland preparation "Female Reproductive Element" is the only holy medicine for regulating menstruation and strengthening the body. After taking it for one month, the reproductive glands will be strong and full, and the breasts and hips will reach perfect development. All female compatriots who want to obtain real beauty, why not seek it from "Female Reproductive Element"?</p>

<h3>Leukorrhea Should Be Thoroughly Treated by Both Husband and Wife, Otherwise It Can Be Transmitted Back and Forth at Any Time</h3>
<p>Venereal diseases, leukorrhea is the most stubborn. If you lose the opportunity to treat it in the acute phase, it will turn into a chronic phase. Although the pain is relieved, the poison is deeply embedded. Patients are often mistaken for having been cured. However, it is difficult for husband and wife not to violate each other in the same room, so at this time it is transmitted to the wife, becoming lymphatic leukorrhea. From then on, they transmit the virus to each other, and the virus becomes deeper. To draw firewood from under the cauldron and eradicate the roots, it is necessary to take the lymphatic special medicine "Anti-Lymph" at the same time to eliminate everything.</p>
<p>For example, there is a local couple, Mr. and Mrs. Tao, both thirty-three or four years old. When Mr. Tao was twenty-six years old, he mistakenly engaged in unclean sex and contracted gonorrhea. In the beginning of the acute phase, it was fierce. He indiscriminately took various medicines to bring the poison into his body, turning it into chronic. The pain was relieved, and he thought he had been cured, so at this time he infected Mrs. Tao, who suffered from leukorrhea and dared not tell him, and Mr. Tao did not know. Later, Mr. Tao relapsed after drinking alcohol, and was introduced to take "Anti-Lymph" internally by a mutual friend, Mr. Lu, and was cured? (Because Mr. Lu had also suffered from gonorrhea before and was cured after taking "Anti-Lymph", and has not recurred since.) Mr. Tao felt that the medicine was different from the various medicines he had taken before, and he felt comfortable and happy in his body, which he had never experienced before, but immediately after having sex with his wife, it relapsed again. He began to feel very strange. In early spring, he came to my office to talk about the previous situation and seek treatment. After I learned the whole story, I knew that the problem was that Mrs. Tao had not been treated at the same time, so I told them to take "Anti-Lymph" at the same time, and Mrs. Tao also ordered the external use of "Leukorrhea Spirit" to remove inflammation and purify it. After a month, both husband and wife were cured, and there has been no recurrence for about half a year.</p>

<p>(1) Another Case of Nocturnal Emission and Premature Ejaculation</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Lei, from Guangxi, 27 years old, is a student. Mr. Lei was induced by bad friends in his childhood, which caused him to engage in severe masturbation. He began to quit before his engagement, but he was already suffering from nocturnal emission. He made a mistake in treatment, which led to a weakness in his vitality. After marriage, he deeply felt the pain of premature ejaculation, and there was no interest in life. His new wife complained, and his feelings gradually faded, leading to a breakdown. I consulted him this spring. I diagnosed that his spermatic cord was lax and his performance was weak. It was necessary to strengthen and replenish him. I immediately told him to purchase "Hemitol's Sperm-Strengthening Tablets" from Wuzhou Pharmacy to strengthen his sperm gate, and nocturnal emission stopped immediately. He also took "Reproductive Element" to strengthen his reproductive glands, and his middle energy was sufficient. At the same time, he was supplemented with electrotherapy, so he was cured in about a month. Recently, I received a letter of thanks from him, saying that the disease he suffered from has never recurred since he left, and his feelings with his wife are better than when they were newly married, and his wife is already three months pregnant.</p>
<p>(2) Divorce Due to Kidney Atrophy</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Sun, from Sichuan, 34 years old, is a businessman. Mr. Sun suffered from masturbation when he was young, which was too severe, and his vitality was lost. His performance became decadent, and he suffered from kidney atrophy and premature ejaculation, making it difficult to fulfill his husband's duties. His wife complained, which was not just a matter of a day or two. Over time, quarrels arose and his feelings tended to break down. He filed a lawsuit in court and was granted a divorce. Mr. Sun suffered this major blow and was lost and depressed. He then decided to seek treatment. After being told to purchase the famous venereal disease medicine "Reproductive Element" from Taihe Pharmacy and receive electrotherapy, his performance was restored immediately, and his vitality re-emerged. Premature ejaculation and kidney atrophy, and chronic diseases were all quickly eliminated. Mr. Sun recalled the past afterwards and regretted not seeking treatment earlier, which led to this lifelong regret.</p>
<p>Safe Smoking Cessation</p>
<p>— (Editor)</p>
<p>(1) Quit Three Times and Smoke Three Times: From Now On, Aversion to Smoke</p>
<p>Mr. Li, a smoker, currently resides in Rehe Road, 47 years old, occupation unknown. He came to see me last month and said that he had been addicted for many years. He tried to quit three times, but symptoms of restlessness such as nocturnal emission and insomnia appeared, his spirit was weak, and his physical strength was unbearable. He resumed smoking. I told him to purchase "Hemitol's Sperm-Strengthening Tablets" from Taihe Pharmacy to treat his nocturnal emission and insomnia, and to take the famous smoking cessation medicine "Reproductive Element" to remove toxins, break the addiction, and replenish losses. At the same time, I also injected "Yuweici Protection" to assist him in order to shorten the quitting period. Therefore, he safely quit smoking in about four days, quickly regained his health, and developed an aversion to smoke.</p>
<p>(2) Elderly Women Quit Their Addiction and Become Healthy</p>
<p>Mrs. Chen of Ladu Road, 52 years old, recently found smoking inconvenient, so she tried to quit once, but because her body was weak, she suffered from back pain and was unable to support herself when she quit, so she gave up halfway. After being introduced to take "Female Reproductive Element", her toxins were removed, her addiction was broken, and her physical strength was strengthened. Her smoking appearance was completely gone, and her complexion was ruddy. She looked 44 or 45 years old. She said that quitting was safe and the quitting period was shortened, which was the most satisfying thing for her.</p>

<h3>Methods for Treating Forgetfulness, Dizziness, Insomnia, and Dreaming</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yu Bofu</p>
<p>The most common disease among young people in cities is neurasthenia. The human affairs are becoming more and more complicated, the stimuli are numerous, and the city sounds are noisy, making it almost impossible to have peace of mind. As a result, the brain nerves are the first to bear the brunt, and forgetfulness, dizziness, insomnia, and dreaming have become common diseases. Moving to a different place for recuperation is not allowed in reality, and self-medication is also difficult for a while. Therefore, it is the duty of doctors to provide instructions and guidance. I am writing this article for reference.</p>
<p>Cerebral neurasthenia is one of the most serious symptoms of neurasthenia, and is mostly caused by sexual neurasthenia. Therefore, patients often complain of symptoms such as nocturnal emission and premature ejaculation. From the perspective of human physiology, semen has the function of sublimating and nourishing the brain marrow. Therefore, if you suffer from nocturnal emission, you must quickly take "Hemitol's Sperm-Strengthening Tablets" to treat it. To replenish sperm and brain, you must take the reproductive gland preparation "Reproductive Element" to play the role of saving decline and strengthening weakness and replenishing losses.</p>
<p>In addition to medication, patients with cerebral weakness should also use the following methods of recuperation at the same time to speed up the treatment: 1. Abstain from tobacco and alcohol and all stimulating foods (such as strong coffee and spicy foods). 2. Get up early and go to bed early, and practice exercise. 3. Do not overwork. 4. Practice abstinence. 5. Choose foods with rich nutrients. 6. Take regular baths and outings.</p>
<p>Numbness in the Limbs</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Jin, often suffers from numbness in his limbs. He has sought treatment many times, but none of them have been very effective. Later, he was introduced by a German doctor to take "Strongston's Bone Pain Tablets" to remove his rheumatism and blood toxins, and he was cured. His limbs are unusually flexible.</p>
<p>Seeking Treatment for Spermatorrhea</p>
<p>Mr. Shen Xueying from Benniu: Your suffering from spermatorrhea is very dangerous. You can quickly take "Hemitol's Sperm-Strengthening Tablets" and "Reproductive Element" at the same time to treat it. Take it for one month in a row without interruption.</p>
<p>Premature Aging</p>
<p>Mr. Ma: You should take "Reproductive Element" to restore your strength, so that your qi and blood will be strong, and your muscles will also develop. As for your weak stomach, you can take "Stomach-Strengthening Medicine" to treat it.</p>
<p>Hidden Leukorrhea</p>
<p>A certain lady in Yishiyuan Lane in the city: Your sister should use "Leukorrhea Spirit" externally to cleanse the vagina and remove inflammation. If she also takes "Female Reproductive Element" at the same time, it will have the effect of treating diseases, strengthening the uterus, regulating menstruation, and maintaining youth.</p>
<p>Bone Pain Common Sense</p>
<h3>Bone Pain Stroke Causes and Consequences</h3>
<p>— Wu Dachao, Bachelor of Medicine, University of Hong Kong</p>
<p>The general public believes that bone pain and stroke are two completely unrelated diseases. According to medical principles, this is not entirely true. Bone pain and stroke have a causal relationship. In other words, bone pain is the precursor to stroke, and stroke is the result of bone pain.</p>
<p>Let's first talk about the causes of bone pain. Some are caused by suffering from wind, cold, and dampness, and some are caused by the accumulation of residual toxins. Patients have abnormal excretion, unclean blood, and excessive uric acid. These acidic toxins form crystals, like pieces of broken glass, which enter the bone joints and cause pain. This is the origin of bone pain. Since there is too much uric acid in the blood, the blood vessel walls are affected, forming sclerosis, which is prone to rupture. This is the origin of stroke.</p>
<p>Therefore, the treatment for bone pain lies first in removing uric acid, and the treatment for stroke is also the most important. Once uric acid is cleared, the bones and joints will be smooth and the pain of bone pain will be gone. The blood vessels will return to their original state, the danger of stroke will be resolved, and the disaster of rupture can be avoided. The reason why the famous medicine "Strongston's Bone Pain Tablets" is regarded as a holy medicine for treating bone pain and a miraculous medicine for preventing stroke lies in its strong acid-dissolving power, but its effects of clearing blood, removing toxins, dispelling wind, and removing dampness are also more than enough. Therefore, it can also play a miraculous effect in treating muscle soreness, muscle spasms, axillary numbness, and body paralysis.</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Sun, 43 years old, suffered from rheumatism in his youth, so he suffered from bone pain from the age of 35. At first, he suffered from muscle soreness and muscle spasms, then limb numbness and body paralysis, which was unbearable. He lost his freedom, his body was weak, and his face was old. I consulted him this spring and told him to purchase "Strongston's Bone Pain Tablets" from Wuzhou Pharmacy to dispel wind, purify toxins, and take "Reproductive Element" to save decline and strengthen weakness. His bone pain was quickly cured, and his body was restored to health, full of strength, and he was like a different person.</p>

<h3>The Rise of Passion Between the Sexes</h3>
<p>— Physician Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>A contribution to young men and women before and after marriage.</p>
<p>In the course of a lifetime, many different flavors of joy and sorrow are distributed to people. The Creator is fair. In order to allow mankind to enjoy the tempering of joy, there is the mutual existence of the two sexes. In this mysterious life of mutual existence, there is an indescribable joy being played out between the two sexes.</p>
<p>A husband should stand in the position of a husband and give full play to his inherent male abilities to satisfy his wife's desires and guide her to the heights of blissful pleasure. Only in this way can a harmonious family be produced, and the pleasures of a healthy sex life be fully experienced. However, it must be said that a person without a healthy body cannot naturally lead a healthy sex life. If a man suffers from nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, spermatorrhea, or impotence, even though he may have the ambition to gorge himself in a butcher's shop, in the end, the rhythm of passion will be shattered due to the exposure of physical weaknesses. A grand ambition will melt away, not only causing distress to himself, but also causing his wife to sigh and shake her head. Over time, hope will forever become a dream. Either a marital breakdown will be implemented, or he will be overtly deceiving you.</p>
<p>The latent danger of this situation is truly not a blessing for the family, and it is indeed a chasm between men and women. Young people! The joy between husband and wife is a gift from heaven, and it should be carefully explored. In order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to be prepared. Please do not hesitate on the wrong path! There is no need to sigh and resent. You must understand: "It is better to retreat and weave a net than to stand by the abyss and envy the fish." Here, I offer you some common knowledge. If you have been suffering from nocturnal emission, take "Hemitol Essence-Consolidating Tablets" to remedy it, so that your semen will be stored and your physical strength will be strong. For premature ejaculation and impotence, there is really no other way to go except to quickly nourish the reproductive glands. At this time, take the truly pure and high-quality reproductive gland hormone preparation "Reproductin." It will not only make your body strong and your muscles firm, but also allow you to bravely advance on the battlefield.</p>

<p>Three Questions About Possible Gonorrhea: First Case</p>
<p>A Fleeting Affair</p>
<p>No. 8, Mr. Sun Xigeng from this city asks: I recently went out with two or three friends to engage in pleasure-seeking, and after a fleeting affair with a certain prostitute, the next day I felt a stinging pain when urinating. I was extremely alarmed at the time and immediately sought medical treatment. The doctor said that it was not yet known whether it was gonorrhea and that it would have to wait a few days. He also gave me an injection of yellow pigment, saying it could prevent it. After returning home, every day felt like a year, and I had no appetite for food—thinking that if I were infected with this disease, the happiness of the rest of my life would be ruined. At the time, I hated that prostitute to the bone. It has now been more than half a month, and the stinging pain when urinating is still there, but there are no other abnormalities. Therefore, I ask: (1) Is it gonorrhea? (2) If it is not gonorrhea, what is it and how can it be treated? (3) Can "yellow pigment" prevent gonorrhea? (4) What are the symptoms of gonorrhea? (5) Is there any relationship between my recent mental fatigue and loss of appetite and my illness?</p>
<p>(1) The incubation period for gonorrhea is one to four days, at most eight days. It has now been more than half a month, so it is not gonorrhea. (2) It is likely a minor injury to the urethra. Severe cases require surgical treatment; mild cases can be treated with "Ucarsol." (3) It is not impossible, but there is no absolute effectiveness. (4) After the incubation period, the person feels tired, has a fever, and experiences a hot, stinging pain when urinating. White pus flows out, and there is urinary urgency and frequency. (5) Not related to the disease; this is caused by emotional distress. Second Case,</p>
<p>Excessive Leukorrhea</p>
<p>No. 9, Mr. Tu Zhenya asks: I engaged in pleasure-seeking before I was married, but I never contracted any diseases. Since marrying my wife, less than half a month ago, my wife suddenly developed a condition with a large amount of leukorrhea. (1) I don't know if it is female gonorrhea? (2) I engaged in pleasure-seeking and did not get sick, but I don't know if I could still infect my wife? (3) How can it be treated?</p>
<p>(1) In clinical diagnosis, female gonorrhea is often determined by the amount of leukorrhea. Based on this, your wife is highly suspected of having gonorrhea. However, to confirm the diagnosis, the leukorrhea must be sent to a doctor for examination. (2) Hiding an illness and avoiding medical treatment is not something that modern people should do. You must not hide from the doctor whether you have had this disease before. The concept of a person being a symptom-free "carrier" does not exist. We would need to answer this after further examination. (4) Take "Sino-acriuqin Tablets" internally, inject "Poligon," and wash the uterus with "Argoacrindin." Third Case,</p>
<p>Chronic Gonorrhea</p>
<p>No. 10, Mr. X asks: I had gonorrhea once last year and bought "Hai Zhuo Ke Xing" myself, which I took for a month before I got better, but it was not completely cured. If I work too hard or drink some alcohol, pus still comes out. Doctor, do you see any way to cure it completely?</p>
<p>Answer: You have "chronic gonorrhea." There is no such thing as "completely cured" or "not completely cured." Simply put, you have not been cured yet. When it comes to treatment, it is easier in the acute stage. To cure chronic gonorrhea, you must make a huge determination. During this period, injections and medications are useless. You only need to wash twice a day with "Argoacrindin." This will likely take a long time, and it is difficult to expect a full cure in less than two months! Self-washing is also not appropriate and may backfire, leading to "orchitis" or "prostatitis" (of course, it also depends on the type of bacteria. Only a few types of the twenty-seventh type of "white turbidity diplococcus" can cause "orchitis" or "prostatitis"). For caution, it is best to have a doctor wash it.</p>
<p>Head Covered in Boils</p>
<p>No. 11, Mr. Zhang Fuquan asks: My little granddaughter is less than one year old, and her head is covered in boils. There are also a few on her shoulders, buttocks, back, and abdomen. I thought it would be completely cured after the boils burst, but they are growing more and more. Please tell me (1) Is it fetal toxin? (2) How can I prevent more from growing? Answer: (1) There is no such thing. (2) Apply "Sanfloid" hot compress and inject "Novargol." Please consult a doctor for the dosage of the latter.</p>
<p>Dysentery for a Long Time</p>
<p>No. 12, Mr. Zhao Fusheng asks: My mother is over forty years old and has never been in good health and often coughs. For the past month, she has been having three or four bowel movements a day. Her stomach doesn't hurt. She bought "Adaras" to take internally, which stops it when she takes it, but then she has diarrhea again. Please tell me (1) Is it "thin stool consumption"? (2) Can it be cured and what medicine should be used? (3) How did this disease come about?</p>
<p>(1) It is "intestinal tuberculosis," also known as "tuberculous intestinal ulcer." What you call "thin stool consumption" is understandable. (2) You can take "Acetanin," but it is difficult to cure. (3) It comes from eating and drinking at the same table with someone who has pulmonary tuberculosis or swallowing your own phlegm, if your mother also has pulmonary tuberculosis. Two Cases of Athlete's Foot: First Case,</p>
<p>Weak Legs</p>
<p>No. 13, Mr. Wang Dasan asks: I have recently been experiencing heart palpitations and weak legs, and my legs go numb after sitting for a short time. (1) Some people say it is athlete's foot, but my feet are not swollen? (2) Is this disease also common in Shanghai? (3) What is the reason? (4) How is it treated?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) It is athlete's foot. There are many types of athlete's foot! Such as "cardiac athlete's foot," "paralytic athlete's foot," "edematous athlete's foot," and "initial athlete's foot," so your feet do not necessarily have to be swollen. Your illness is likely paralytic athlete's foot. (2) As far as I know, there are many diseases in Shanghai, especially among laborers, which is a major problem for the future. (3) Lack of "Vitamin B4" and bacterial infection at the same time. (4) Take "Vitamin B" internally, inject "Strychnin Nitrata," avoid rice, eat more vegetables and fruits, and eat less steamed buns and bread. Second Case,</p>
<p>Swollen Feet</p>
<p>No. 14, Mr. Gao Zhanqi asks: My wife gave birth this year and is still breastfeeding. Her feet are gradually swelling. She has no appetite and is constipated, which is suspected to be athlete's foot. Please tell me (1) Is it athlete's foot? (2) How is it treated? (3) Are her lack of appetite and constipation related to athlete's foot? (4) Can it be cured by returning to my hometown? (5) A friend of mine has had athlete's foot and said that athlete's foot has no tendon reflexes. What are tendon reflexes?</p>
<p>(1) Although I cannot say for sure without an examination, based on what you have described, it seems quite like athlete's foot. (2) See item 4 of No. 13. You can take "Laxadon" for constipation, and "Actose-Pepsine" for lack of appetite. (3) Lack of appetite and constipation are also symptoms of athlete's foot. (4) Change of environment is most effective for this disease. (5) Have the person sit upright on the edge of the bed with both lower legs hanging down. Gently tap the lower end of the kneecap. After a slight delay, the leg will kick forward and the foot will flick upward, which is a "normal" "knee reflex." If the leg kicks forward immediately without delay and the foot does not flick upward, it is called "hyperactivity," which is a symptom of initial athlete's foot. If the movement is not agile after tapping, it is called "decreased," which is a symptom of late-stage athlete's foot. If there is no movement at all after tapping, it is called "disappearance," which is also a symptom of late-stage athlete's foot. However, this cannot be accurately checked without experience.</p>
<p>Fat in Stool</p>
<p>No. 15, Mr. Cheng Yi asks: My daughter is six years old and often complains of abdominal pain. She passes semi-solid protein-like fatty strips in her stool. Please tell me (1) What disease is it? (2) What medicine can cure it?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) "Mucous colitis." (2) You can take Vitamin-A and Vitamin-B supplements regularly.</p>
<p>Swollen Testicles</p>
<p>No. 16, Mr. Ouyang Yaguang asks: I am a laborer. I have had swollen testicles since I was a child. It feels like there is a puff of air inside, and it often moves around. If I press it hard, it goes back in. Because of my work, it is very inconvenient. I want to cure it. Please recommend a place to get treatment that will save me money. To be honest, sir, I have trouble affording food with the few dollars I make a month, so I really can't afford to treat a disease on my body!</p>
<p>Answer: You seem to have an "external inguinal hernia." As Bian Que said, "Acupuncture cannot reach it, and wine cannot cure it." The only way to cure it completely is with surgery. I think there must be charitable doctors in many hospitals in Shanghai who will treat you for free. Recommending doctors really concerns medical ethics, so I cannot help you.</p>
<p>Frequent Colds</p>
<p>No. 17, Mr. Li Junda asks: I am weak and often catch colds. Although colds are a minor matter, I am very afraid that frequent fevers and coughs will lead to lung disease. Therefore, (1) please quickly think of a way to prevent me from catching colds again. (2) If I really cannot prevent them, please indicate a treatment for colds so that I can get better quickly when I get sick.</p>
<p>(Answer): (1) It is not known whether you have "chronic sinusitis" or "tonsillitis." If you do, you will no longer catch colds so often after surgery. In addition, you can get injections of "Influenza Vaccine Serum," but its effectiveness is not reliable. It is most important to strengthen your body and increase your body's resistance. (2) Use "Caphedrin No. 2" to decongest your nose; take "Kresocal" for coughing; and take "Tonbelin" for headaches and fever.</p>
<p>Wet and Rotten Lower Legs</p>
<p>No. 18, Mr. Liu Heshang asks: Last winter, my lower legs were scratched by bedbugs, and the wounds have been getting bigger and bigger. Now they are three inches big, and they don't hurt or itch. The flesh is blackish. I have seen many doctors and used many medicines, but none have been effective. Please tell me if there is any way to cure it.</p>
<p>Answer: It is a "chronic ulcer," and it is difficult to cure. However, based on my experience, there is only one medicine that is effective for treating this disease, called "Pixrol Ointment." However, you must persevere, and it will be difficult to expect a cure in less than several days to several weeks.</p>
<p>Want to Quit Smoking</p>
<p>No. 19, Mr. Xie Liheng asks: I have been addicted to cigarettes for many years, and I have recently been experiencing dizziness, which I am afraid is poisoning, so I plan to quit. My fingers are yellowed, and the bad taste is very annoying. I have tried to quit several times, but I relapse after quitting. I have no good way to quit completely. Please advise me on a method.</p>
<p>Answer: "Hormspermin" can be used as an aid to quit smoking and drinking.</p>
<p>Please Help Me Quit Opium</p>
<p>(1) Can your clinic help me quit opium? (2) What is the cost of the medication? (3) Can I quit at home, and will it be painful? (4) "Busming" can be used to quit opium, I wonder if it can also be used to quit opium (second form, in this case)? What is the price? (No. 20, Mr. Y.S. asks)</p>
<p>(1) Yes. (2) From five yuan to fifty yuan, depending on the amount of opium used. The cost of injections is extra. (3) Yes, without great pain. A strong man, to relieve the great pain of the future, why be timid and afraid of the small pain of the present? (4) Yes, you can ask the pharmacy directly for the price.</p>
<p>Long Foreskin</p>
<p>No. 21, Mr. Zhao Xiaolin asks: (1) What are the harms of a long foreskin? (2) What is the surgery fee? (3) Can you do the surgery at your clinic? Will it be painful, and how many days will it take to heal? (4) What are your clinic hours?</p>
<p>(1) It collects dirt and grime, and easily causes balanitis, foreskin edema, and glans inflammation. It can cause infertility after marriage and is prone to venereal diseases. (2) The fees vary from doctor to doctor. My fee is five yuan. (3) Yes; no great pain; five days to one week. (5) 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM, 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>The Beihai Incident</h3>
<p>— Me</p>
<p>The Chengdu incident, in which Japanese Ambassador to China Kawagoe, has just received instructions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to prepare for talks, but unexpectedly, the Beihai incident suddenly occurred again. The continuous occurrence of such unfortunate incidents is truly a major blow to the friendly relations between the two countries, which is deeply regrettable.</p>
<p>How did the Chengdu incident start, and how did such serious consequences occur? A more detailed report has not been obtained at this time, so it is impossible to make a concrete judgment. However, there are several points that can be inferred: (1) Ordinary rioters disrupted local order, and Japanese reporters happened to be there and suffered misfortune, with no intention of revenge. (2) Ordinary rioters took advantage of the tense situation between China and Japan to vent their pent-up anger or to create a situation that was difficult to resolve through negotiations, making it difficult for the government to cope. However, this kind of incident occurred in the provincial capital of Chengdu, and the local authorities cannot but bear the responsibility for it. However, it is only a local incident and is generally unrelated to national relations. It should not be made a big deal out of a small issue.</p>
<p>As for the Beihai incident, it is even more unfortunate. Although Guangdong has now been largely pacified, the local issues in Guangxi Province are currently being negotiated, and there is a good turn for a peaceful resolution. However, the generally strong and unruly troops, who come when Li Bai calls them, cannot be dismissed as quickly as desired. These troops are still lingering in the Beihai area. At this time, they are unwilling to accept not only the orders of the central government, but also likely the orders of Li Bai. These troops, gathered in one corner, seeing no hope of a way out, fear nothing more than peace in the area, and they long for something to happen every day. They do not hesitate to create this kind of heinous crime, making things difficult for the central government. Under these circumstances, the central government has no way to protect foreign nationals, and can only hope that foreign nationals are good at taking care of themselves. Therefore, this kind of responsibility is one that our authorities do not dare to shirk, but they also cannot fully bear the responsibility for it.</p>
<p>In short, at a time when the negotiations between the two countries are serious, and when the negotiations between the two countries are improving, foreign nationals should be cautious and prudent, and should exercise some restraint in these unstable areas to avoid causing incidents. Because the government's protection of foreign nationals is originally a duty, but in the chaotic local situation, although there is a sincere desire to protect, the circumstances are restrictive and it is difficult to be comprehensive in a short time. This is also a helpless situation.</p>
<p>Moreover, this kind of incident occurs in a certain local area, either because ruffians take the opportunity to make trouble, or because undisciplined soldiers who are not under the control of the central government use this as a tool to oppose the central government. Therefore, this kind of incident is entirely local in nature, and cannot be exaggerated or expanded to be equated with the entire negotiation. Therefore, the adjustment of diplomatic relations between China and Japan is originally outside of this kind of problem, and not within this kind of problem. If this kind of incident is equated with the overall negotiation, then difficult problems will be in the aftermath.</p>
<h3>A Pair of Pants</h3>
<p>— Meiping</p>
<p>The bright moon is in the sky, the night is as cool as fire, and there was a drizzle again late in the evening. The universe seems to have been washed clean without a trace of dust. Sitting alone by the window, listening to the chirping of insects in the courtyard, the weariness that summer has given me is now like a weary traveler who has found a warm inn and is happily resting.</p>
<p>On such a quiet night, I should have gone to bed earlier to make up for months of insomnia, but the clock has already struck once, and I am still sitting by the window, waiting like a lover. On the table is a book that I like to read, and now it has been flipped to the last page by the gentle autumn breeze. It is an advertisement for a fashion store, with gentlemen and ladies wearing fur-collared coats walking out of that store. Yes, it is already autumn, and a cold winter is coming soon.</p>
<p>So I felt a chill invading my limbs, and I hurriedly put on my bathrobe, closed the window, and went to bed. My nasal passages were already slightly congested. Getting sick in the fall is also a blessing, but that fashion store advertisement is deeply imprinted on my brain. A friend who is still wearing a worn-out white canvas suit seems to have no qualifications to have a happy little illness.</p>
<p>I began to notice the two trunks quietly lying in the corner, as cautious as a thief. They are my only two trunks. They are my companions. From the yellow sand-swept north to the warm south, they have never left me for a second. The various luggage tags on them, like the wrinkles on my forehead, are so numerous that their exact age cannot be estimated.</p>
<p>What exactly is hidden in those two trunks? Even I, the owner, am a little vague, because I haven't changed the clothes I'm wearing since I moved here. That's only secondary. When I want to get a little hope from them, I can hardly even remember where to put the keys.</p>
<p>The trunks are covered in a thick layer of dust. I wipe them with a dry cloth, and with a little force, they make a groaning sound. Do they resent that I, the owner, am not paying attention to their health? When it rains, leaks drip down from the walls and accumulate on the bottom of the trunks. The only window in this room is so far away that they can't see any sunlight, and they only let dust and cobwebs build homes.</p>
<p>The trunk is open, and a musty smell rushes straight into my nostrils. In the dim light, my eyes are blurred. I can't see anything. I suspect that the trunk is empty. So, like a blind man, I reach in to feel around. I feel a few slippery things. Now I can see them very clearly. They are broken socks and smelly undershirts. I keep feeling until I reach the bottom of the trunk, and then I find the treasure: a pair of evergreen Western pants are folded and lying there. Although my sense of touch tells me that they are as greasy as loaches and covered with many white spots, my joy is indescribable. It's autumn, and I should put on autumn clothes.</p>
<p>But I am immediately disappointed again. What about the top? What about the vest? That suit was made in a small city, so the style is naturally not very beautiful, and the price is half as cheap as in a big city. Now, if I just go to get a top made, I'm afraid it will cost that much money, right? So I open the second trunk, because I'm too busy moving and often just pile things randomly into the two trunks before I leave. The second trunk is open again. What I pull out are broken socks and smelly undershirts, all the way to the bottom. There's nothing there.</p>
<p>I lie back in bed, thinking about my last move. My last move was after I was seriously ill. The expenses for medical treatment sent all my valuables to the Changsheng warehouse. And because I couldn't find the pants at the time, I only sold the top and vest of that suit. So, what am I still looking for?</p>
<p>The moonlight in autumn is too beautiful. It shines through that small window onto my sleeping bed, allowing me to fall asleep instinctively. But I no longer have the interest to enjoy the moon. On the contrary, I find it very annoying.</p>
<p>My nasal passages are still congested. I'm afraid I'll get sick tomorrow.</p>

Love is making a big fuss inside. It says spring has arrived. Love quarrels. Love makes a fuss. The heart cannot be closed. Our hearts are full of passion. Even the Yangtze River cannot extinguish it. Heart fire burns. Heart fire jumps. The heart cannot be closed. Look at the green grass. Look at the bright moon. That is our pure and true love. Flowers smile brightly. Little stars twinkle. Flowers are my body. Stars are my heart. God turns us into one clay figure. Beaten with hammers. Burned with fire. In the future. Forever inseparable.</p>
