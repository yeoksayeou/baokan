<p>— 宜</p>
<p>我政府對於中日和平之維持可謂盡其最大之努力矣初則遷就華北之非常局勢而設立冀察政務委員會繼則正式向日提議在京召開中日國交調整會議以謀中日外交之重入常軌然此種努力非惟不能稍獲日本軍人方面之諒解彼等甚且變本加厲圖再割裂我領土使中日兩民族益復加深其隔閡如僞軍李守信部及蒙古僞保安隊之侵佔察省六縣僞保安隊趙雷部之侵佔塘沽軍糧城及漢奸殷汝耕之與僞滿商訂軍事經濟及交通之恊定顯皆出於日本軍人之策動此外華北日軍爲作挑釁口實而造成之地方糾紛亦有數起最近據東京電訊日軍部方面擬向國會提出其關於對外政策之主張其內容有謂陸軍將確保其與「滿洲國」接壤地域之華北治安而助長地方住民之幸福故對於「民衆自動」之運動亦當採取援助之立塲云云吾人觀於華北日本軍人以往之舉措以及日軍部之决定恢復靑濟駐軍及增加平津駐軍可知彼輩所謂確保華北治安者實欲以武力控制華北所謂助長地方住民之幸福者實欲在我當地同胞間推行其麻醉政策至所謂「民衆自動」之運動則顯已示例於殷汝耕之僞自治運動其爲割裂我領土之烟幕彈固舉世皆知我全國民眾對於此種「自治」醜劇允不能不引爲民族之奇恥而下剷除之决心也</p>
<p>今者著名之土肥原又復到津活動矣僞自治運動之醜劇其將更趨擴大乎去年十一月間甚囂塵上之五省僞自治運動曾因我若干將領之深明大義而卒消弭此乃土肥原輩所未能甘心者日昨土肥原到津津日軍部有一度秘密會議而坂垣磯谷等日武官且僕僕於靑濟平津之間證以日軍部對華北問題所表示之主張則上項運動之將死灰復燃不無蛛絲馬跡可尋也</p>

<h3 id="c73">「死」的神秘　靈魂不死沒有科學上的證據 <a href="#c73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>美國生物學家卡萊爾博士AlexisCarrel推想在今後三百年中，返老還童術或能進展到科學可以决定「死」是吾永爲一種神秘的地步。同時他又警告大衆，用人力把「死」展緩，使許多無用之人，留在人間，爲害實大於「死」的本身，這正切合中國「老而不死是爲賊」的古話了。</p>
<p>博士近在紐的醫學院討論「死的神秘」時，說道！「假使人壽忽然增高到百歲，於是文明便不能肩荷老者居多的人民的經濟擔負。今日文明的習慣和制度，含有一種秩序，那便是社會中的許多衰弱久病和笨漢，靠了「死」的帮助，才能把他們淸除。」</p>
<p>現所發展可爲靈魂不死的科學上的一切證據，博士都不以爲然。他說：「現在有數萬萬人相信靈魂不死，這種信念，是屬於宗敎和哲學範圍，却不屬於實騐的科學範圍。靈學家自稱死後靈魂長存，已經證明。但心靈的活動，爲我們所知道的，是活着的身體上的一種形象，在器官崩解以後，便永遠不會自己表現出來的。性靈或性靈的一部分，死後依然存在之說，目前還沒有科學上的證據，但沒有一個人有權可說這種存在是不可能的。」</p>
<p>博士於是引述細胞有潛能的不死性，只要用林白大佐近所發明的方法，可把已死動物的全部器官依然長大，並能維持人造血的循環。博士自己曾在洛基斐勒研究院中把由雞肚裏挖出的一顆心，立刻放在坡璃管中，用科學方法保持它的生機，至今已二十四年，還活潑潑地躍動哩。</p>
<p>博士决述及起死回生和返老還童術，說道：「假使已死的人，使他回生太遲，那人雖然復活，却沒有靈魂。曾有一决，一個女子在合法死去九分鐘後恢復生命，但是她的四肢却麻木不仁，行爲如一個畜類一般。心靈的活動，大槪在身體死的以前便已消滅，死了以後，便永遠不會自己表現的。」</p>
<p>「靈學家自稱死後靈魂長存，已經證明，而有實騐的證據。這種猜測所根據的事實，我們不能否認其重要。但是他們對實騐結果所作的解釋，似不正確。靈學家忘記世上有千里眼術能够察知過去和未來的事情，所以死後存在的心靈原則，和千里眼術所表露的現象，恰是一而二，二而一，欲加區別，是不可能的。」</p>
<p>「和「死」為抗的力量，其一便是覔求生理學上能决定壽限的因素。現在世上不乏百齡老人，很可表示我們的身體含有比我們所覺得更大的潛能性。大的除去遺傳性之外，或種養生法，或種食品，或種延壽的心靈態度，都是重要條件。這些條件的研究，今日還在萌芽之中，但是已經發見了不少有意義的事實。」博士於是引洛基斐勒研究院中飼養小鼠的經騐爲證。有幾種食品，能增大體量，所生的鼠仔，也因以比尋常爲大，還能减少感染肺炎的可能性，可是不能延長壽命。另有幾種食品，能减小體量，在第一個月中，還能增高死率，可是確能延長壽命。這種結果，使人相信食品和養生法的適當運用，都能延長人的壽命。</p>
<p>博士又說：「乾細胞也有潛伏的生命。李泊旭資氏曾把半乾的機體，接在一頭豚鼠身上，居然能够復活，還能再發出腺分泌。」</p>
<p>博士於是對於這種理想，作游戲的推測，以爲我們能够把人世的生物，置於長時期中止活動的狀態中，並把有限個體的「死」，作長期的延緩。他說：「這事現在雖很渺茫，但是已爲四大可能。性之一。將來或能够把若干個體作長時期的儲藏，使之不生不死，然後再使之恢復尋常生活若千時，也許能用這法使之活幾百年。這話雖覺荒誕，然而我們要知道今日的烏託邦，便是明日的現實。」</p>
<p>「因爲時鐘所記的時刻，在各種生物的內部裹經過不能顚倒的變遝，也順序記着，所以我們要把「死」征服，是一件不可思議之事。人的平均壽限，現在已有顯著的增加，壽命的最高限度，也許將來多少能够大大地展長。將來或突然有意想不到的新發明，開啟返老還童的新可能性。人和「死」的决鬥、或者勝利了後，反而不美，因爲把許多人的「死」，用人力展緩，爲害實大於「死」的本身，「死」，不是一種災難，也不是一種幸福，「死」不是由外而入的變故，却是我們本身上的一部分，理所必然，並且是生命上一種必不可少的條件」。博士這番言論，很可以消除許多人貪生惡死的謬念，和打破想成神仙的迷夢。</p>

<h3 id="c82">國語科講演　怎樣閱讀 <a href="#c82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— 開明書店編譯主任夏丐尊</p>
<p>前天我曾對中學生諸君講過一次話，題目是「閱讀甚麼」，今天所講的，可以說是前回的連續，題目是「怎樣閱讀」。前回講「閱讀甚麼」，是閱讀的種類，今天講「怎樣閱讀」是閱讀的方法。</p>
<p>「怎樣閱讀」和「閱讀甚麼」一樣，也是個老問題，從來已有許多人對於這問題說過種種的話，我今天所講的也並無前人所沒有發表過的新意見，新方法。今天的話是對中學生諸君講的，我只希望我的話能適合於中學生諸君就是了。</p>
<p>我在前回講「閱讀甚麼」的時候，曾經把閱讀的範圍劃成三個方面。第一是職務上的書，第二是參考的書，第三是趣味修養的書。中學生的職務在學習中學校的課程，中學校的各科敎科書履於第一類，學習功課的時候須有別的書籍作參考，這是參考書，屬於第二類。在課外選採些合乎自己個人趣味或有關修養的書來閱讀，這是第三類。今天講「怎樣閱讀」也仍想依據了這三個方面來說。</p>
<p>先講第一類關於諸君職務的書，就是敎科書，擺在諸君案頭的敎科書，有兩種性質可分，一種是有嚴密的系統的，一種是沒有嚴密的系統的，如算學，理化，地理，歷史，植物，動物，等科的書，都有一定的章節，一定的前後次序，這是有系統的。如國文讀本，如英文讀本，就定不出嚴密的系統，一篇韓愈的原道可以收在初中國文第一冊裏，也可以收在高中國文第二冊裏，一篇勿蘭克林的傳記，可以擺在初中英文第三冊，也可以擺在高中英文第二冊。諸君如果是對於自己所用着的敎科書留心的想來早已知道這情形。這情形並不是偶然的，可以說和學科的性質有關，有嚴密的系統的是屬於一般的所謂科學，像國文英文之類是專以語言文字爲對象的，除文法書修辭學書以外，一般所謂讀本敎本，皆是用來作模範，作練習的工具的東西，所以本身就沒有嚴密的系統了。敎科書既然有這種分別，閱讀的方法就也應該有不同的地方。</p>
<p>如果把閱讀分別開來說，一般科學的敎科書應該偏重在閱，語言文學的敎科書應該偏重在讀。一般科學的敎科書，雖也用語言文字寫着，但我們學習的目標並不在語言文字上，譬如說，我們學地理，學化學，所當注意的是地理化學書上所記着的事項木身，這些事項除圖表外原用語言文字記着，但我們不必專從語言文字上去記憶揣摩，只要從語言文字去求得內容就够了。至於語言文字的學科就不同，我們在國文敎科書裏讀到一篇文章——假定是韓愈的書記，這時我們不但該知道韓愈這個人，理解這篇畫記的內容，還該有別的目標，如文章的結搆，詞句的式樣，描寫表現的方法等等，皆得加以研究。如果讀韓愈的畫記，只知道當時曾有過這樣的畫，韓愈曾寫過這樣的一篇文章，那就等於不曾把這篇文章當作國文功課學習過。我們在英文敎科書裏讀華盛頓砍櫻桃樹的故事，目的並不在想知道華盛頓爲甚麼砍櫻桃樹，後來怎樣，乃是要把這故事當作學習英文的材料，收得英文上種種的法則。所以閱讀兩個字不妨分開來用，一般科學的敎科書應懂它的內容，不必從語言文字上去瞎費力，只要好好地閱魷行，像國文英文兩門是語言文字的功課，應在形式上多用力，只閱不够，該好好地讀。</p>
<p>不論是閱，或是讀，對於敎科書該毫不放鬆，因爲這是正式功課，是諸君職務上的工作。有疑難，得去翻字典，有問題，得去查書。這就是所謂參考書了。參考書爲用功的人預備的，因爲要參考先得有參考的項目或問題，這些項目或問題，要閱讀認眞的人才會從各方面發生。這理由我在前回已經講過，諸君聽過的想尚還能記憶，不多說了。現在讓我來說些閱讀參考書的時候該注意的事情。</p>
<p>第一，我勸諸君暫時認定參考的範圍，不要把自己所要參考的項目，或問題拋荒。我們查字典，大概把所要查的字或典故查出了就滿足，不會再分心在字典上的。可是如果是字典以外的參考書，一不小心，往往有轉輾跑遠的事情，舉例來說，你讀桃花源記，爲了「烏托邦思想」的一個項目，去把馬列斯的理想鄉消息來作參考書讀，是對的，但你得暫時記住，你所要參考的是「烏托邦思想」，不是別的項目。你不要因讀了馬列斯的理想鄉消息，就把心分到很遠的地方去。馬列斯是主張美術的，是社會思想家，你如果不留意，也許會把所讀的桃花源記忘掉，像社會思想咧，美術咧等等的念頭上打圈子，從甲方面轉到乙方面，從乙方而再轉到丙方面，結果會弄得頭腦雜亂無章。我們和朋友談話的時候，常常有把話頭遠遠地扯開去，忘記方才所說的是什麼的。這和因爲看參考書把本來的題目拋荒，情形很相像。懂得說話方法的人，碰到這種情形，常會提醒對手，把話說回來，回到所要說的事情上去。看參考書的時候，也該有同樣的注意，和自己所想參考的題目無直接關係的方面，不該去多分心。</p>
<p>第二，是勸諸君乘參考之便，留意一般書籍的性質和內容大略，除了查檢字典和翻閱雜誌以外，所謂參考書者，普通都是一部一部的獨立的書籍，一部書有一部書的性質，內容和組織式樣。你爲了參考，旣有機會去見到某一部書，乘便把部書的情形知道一些，是並不費事的。諸君在中學裏有種種規定要做的工作，課外讀書的時間是很少的。有些書在常識上，將來應用上，却非知道不可。例如，我們在中學校裏不讀二十四史十三經，但二十叫史十三經是什麼樣的東西，却是該知道的常識。我們不做基督敎徒，不必讀聖經，但新的和舊的的大略內容，却是該知道的常識。如果你讀歷史課，對於「漢武帝擴展疆土」的題目，想知道些詳細情形，去翻史記，或是漢書，這時候你大槪會先翻目錄吧，你翻目錄，一定會見到「本紀」「世家」「列傳」「表」「志」等的名目，這就是史記或漢書的組織構造，你讀了裹面的武帝本紀一篇，或全篇裹的幾段，再把這些目錄看過，在你就算是對於史記，或漢書發生過關係，史記漢書是怎樣的書，你可懂得大概了。再舉一個例來說，你在植物或動物學敎師口頭聽到「進化論」的話，你如果想對這題目多知道些詳細情形，你可到圖書館去找書來看，假定你找到一本陳兼善的進化論綱要，你可先閱序文，看這部書是講甚麼方面的，再查目錄，看裹面有些甚麼項目。你目前所要參老的也許只是其中的一節或一章，但這全書的概括智識，於你是很有用處的，你能隨時留心，一年之中，可以收得許多書籍的概括的大略智識，久而久之，你就知道那些書裏有些甚麼東西，要查那些事項，該去找甚麼警，翻檢起來，非常便利。　（未完）</p>

<p>大陸銀行前與華豐·潤豐·元豐·震泰·長順·義生·福昌·裕中·萬茂·華通·德茂·恒茂·正康·等十三家錢莊、訂立領用中南銀行鈔票、數共一百七十五萬元、由各莊交存四成現金保證、而大陸則給以該項保證金之週息六厘半、乃自上年十一月四日、財政部頒行統一幣制發行令後、大陸銀行即藉口要求各莊取消所訂領劵契的、經各莊推代表馬文祥·劉希孟·殷煥之·等與大陸行長葉扶霄交涉無效、遂延律師詹紀鳳、向第一特區地方法院對大陸提起</p>
<p>確認契約　及給付利息之訴、會經一度傳審、已誌前報、茲悉大陸銀行業於日前向法院提出書面答辯、瀝叙理由八點、法院隨將該項答辯送達原吿、而原吿代理律師詹紀鳳氏、因複具狀逐點辯駁、謂尋繹被吿所發理由、就表面論、一若有詞可藉、而夷考實際、則所言絕無事證可憑、爰特撮要答辯如左、　査財政部於上年十一月四日施行統一幣政、不過</p>
<p>禁用硬秈　對於私立銀行特許發行之鈔票、並未禁用、非特未加禁用、抑且於布吿中明示所有硬幣、如換上述特許發行之鈔票、亦准一律通用、是財部統一幣政之命令、與原吿推行中南鈔幣之現狀、初無影響、事理至爲明顯、不意該被吿竟藉此項命令、以牽强附會之理由、取消原吿之權益、無論衡之情法、均難容許、至謂已印未發之中南鈔票、不能實行及已經發行之鈔票、亦</p>
<p>逐漸收回　云云、前者應否增加發行、須視該行是吾需要爲標準、若其現時發行之鈔票已足運用、則雖無財部明令亦無增加發行之必要、乃該被吿列為廢止合約原因之一、殊乏根據、後者所謂逐漸收回、查「逐漸」二字字義、界限頗廣、究竟該幣已否開始逐漸收回、收回者是吾即屬原吿人推行之暗記券、該被告均無確切聲明、又溯自該行奉令至今、已逾兩月、苟其逐漸收回之語非虛、則於此</p>
<p>長時期內　當已有鉅額收回、何不於辯訴中聲明確數、以證其說、查民訴法當事人欲求法院爲有利於己之判决、須負舉證之資、今該被告徒托空言、毫無事證提出、此合的不容廢止者一、　被吿辯訴所述第二第三兩點所述理由、無非以自財部頒佈統一幣制命令後所訂合的、原吿巳不能機續履行爲詞、無驟不聞能之未嘗不言之成理、殊不知在原吿方面、絕無不能</p>
<p>繼續履行　之情狀、所以不得繼續履行者、實由被告利用機會、自己不依合的第四第五兩條循序辦理、反責原吿不能盡其任務、顚倒是非、莫此爲甚、夫此决政府施行統一幣政、不過禁用硬幣、巳如上述、同時並未禁用中南鈔幣、質言之、中南鈔幣一日不加禁用、雙方所訂合的上之權義、自係存續一日、該被告所謂訂的之目的及繼續性之工作、因法令而消滅、胥屬　詞、委非事實、此合約</p>
<p>不容廢止　者二、　被告辯訴理由第三點、謂原告領用之兌換券、有爲被吿繼續不斷的推行使之全部流通市上云云所謂「繼續不斷」四字、原吿遍檢合的、未見有此字樣、旣無此項用語、可見出諸被吿憑空杜撰、查原吿之責任、不過於暗記券發生回籠（見被告辯訴狀）情事時、隨時換回而巳、原告盡此義務、迄已有年、被告謂原吿雖欲領券、而無券可領、雖欲推行、而</p>
<p>無券可發　云云、要知原吿於締的後、即經將晤記券如的領完、辯訴云云、盡屬題外之事、該被吿所以故事牽扯者、無非自知理曲、意在淆惑觀聽而已、此合的不容廢止者三、　被吿辯訴第四點、一則曰享受利益、爲數甚鉅、再則日原告妄思不勞而獲之利、一若原吿方面果獲如何之學利奢、逆知雙方契的、誠如被吿所言、一方須盡義務、始得要求給付權利、在原吿方面、依照合約</p>
<p>所盡義務　亦不可謂不重例如合的第六條被吿兌回之暗記券、如原吿不照合約第四五條規定履行、則被吿代墊兌之現金、應以全額按照滬巿拆息、再加四元半計算欠息、（即每千元至少按月息九厘）如日拆增高、尙須依此遞加、又如合約第四條、原吿派員向被吿換回代兌之暗記券、途中往還、如遇盜竊遺失等等一切責任、皆由原吿負担、試思依照合的、原吿所負之責任、</p>
<p>何等重大而所交納之準備金、祗有四成、可以年博數厘之利息、而六成且不計利息、夫原吿所負之責任重大如彼、而所博之利息纖細如此、乃被吿辯訴中、猶復誇大其詞、謂原告受益優厚、察其用意、無非因廢的於法無據、故特舖陳利益、以博社會之同情、而免與論之指摘、庸知合的一經合法成立、應受法律保護、豈容任意廢毀、此合的不容廢止者四、　被吿辯訴第五六兩點、非</p>

<p>— Louisa　M．Alcott原著　鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>「我不相信你是會的，你有時愛打出手，但是你不說謊，我不信你會偷竊的，」乃德說時，幷且搖着頭，表示决不然的。</p>
<p>「我道　些事都曾做過。我愛說謊話，像發狂一般：現在我以爲這是太麻煩了；當我從貝先生那裹逃走的時候，我偷了園裹的東西當路糧，所以你看我確是個壞坯子，」唐恩說道，幷且用那種粗魯無賴的聲氣，這，他近來芷勉力在掙脫呢。</p>
<p>「呵唐恩！莫說這是你做的！我寗可隨便什麼別的孩子做的，乃德叫道，　　裹那麼憂切，唐恩感激之下便不由得露出欣悅之色，而且表示他確是樂意的，因爲他就旋轉身來，臉上却有一種希奇的神色，雖然他只回答道：</p>
<p>「我不願說什麼話。但是你也不用煩惱，我們總會好好過去的，你看罷。」</p>
<p>他的臉色和他的態度給了乃德一種新的意思：他於是緊合他的兩手，急切訴說道：</p>
<p>「我想你知道是誰做的。假使是的，求他說了罷，唐恩。他們大家無緣無故恨我，實在難受。我想我實在不能再忍受下去。假如我有地方可去，我寗可離開了我所深愛的梅莊，到別地去了；可是我沒有你那麼的身子，也沒有你的勇氣，因此我只得留住，老等着有人告訴他們我是沒有說謊的。」</p>

<p>自去年八月美國實行白銀國有後，隨銀價之在漲而我國白銀滾滾外流，但至今年，則白銀外流之勢已見終止，反有入超之狀，更觀下表即明。</p>
<p>二十四年上海現銀輸出入比較表（註五）</p>
<p>惟現銀之偷運，爲前表所不能表現，故實際情形，當非如此簡單也。</p>
<p>考現銀之得以終止外流，實有下列之原因：</p>
<p>因平衡稅之微收，運銀出口，實際巳無利可圖。</p>
<p>我國外匯已逐漸上漲，與銀價之差價較小，運銀出口，亦屬無利。</p>
<p>因我國中央銀行與上海外商銀行結紳士協定，外商銀行之操縱减少。</p>

<p>經濟界之與外匯漲落直接有關者，莫進出口貿易若，吾人試一觀本年匯價變動與進出口貿易之情形：（註六）</p>
<p>貿易有季節之關係，固不能以短期情形，察其一般趨勢，然外匯與之有直接影饗，縱時間甚短，大體上亦能窺見一斑。我國外匯上漲，表示爲我國貨幣購買力之提高，在理論上言，我國輸入應由是大為增進，然觀上表，一月至五月輸入雖逐漸增加，但吾人除去季節性之影響外，謂由於貨幣購買力提高而增進者究有幾何，初未能即可斷言，據近今海關報吿，本年上半年我國貿易輸出入總値均較往年同期爲减退，計輸入總値較去年同期减少二千四百三十九萬四千五百四十一元，輸出較去年同期减少九百十七萬五千零四十一元（註七）。蓋輸入之增進，非單純之貨幣購買力提高即可爲力，設一方貨幣購買力提高，而他方社會經濟不振，一般講買力低弱，則消費仍必不起，比以頃銷政策爲奪取他國市塲者，所應取鑑者也。</p>

<p>— 永采</p>
<p>在這不景氣氛圍的籠罩下，北里花訊，也日趨闌珊了。一般慣喜尋芳作樂的墜鞭公子，慘綠少年，到這時也因囊篋不裕，祇能麼挲着兩隻大衣袋子，徒呼負負而已。</p>
<p>考妓的肇始，雖倡於管子的「女閭三百」，但一直到明代才漸盛。那時凡自命風流的騷人墨客，總喜歡一遊金閶。興到時更詠詩數首，傳之友好。所以詠妓詩是以明代爲最多。假使我們來悉心蒐集一下，訂一集「妓詩三百首」，確也是部皇皇大觀的巨著。倒不讓唐詩專美於前咧。</p>
<p>我國因南北方的處境不同，所以習性也異。雖微小至一舉一動，也會將個性不自然而然的流露出來。就以妓而論：南妓慣會灌迷湯，掉槍花，用圓滑而假惺惺的手段來籠絡相好。北妓呢，賦性爽直而尚情義，每與生客繾綣過一次，情之所鍾，也都以眞情眞義相對待。這是一個極顯著而確切的事實。</p>
<p>北方下等妓寮，有「摸黑」，「鷄毛窩」等數種，都是苦力車夫們尋歡的地方，每决僅納資銅元數十枚耳。聽說「鷄毛窩」的設備，較「摸黑」允爲簡單。屋中除數妓外，祇有一坑，坑上堆置鷄毛若干，卽作爲「待合所」了。這是一位北里遊的健將吿訴我的。</p>
<p>明人陳大聲，有嘲北妓曲一闋，雖寥寥十數句，已極盡諷刺描寫的能事。特錄之，以博一粲：門前一陣騾馬過，灰揚，那裹有踏花歸去馬蹄香。棉襖棉褲棉裙子，膀脹，那裹有春風初試薄羅裳。生葱生蒜生韮菜，醃臟，那裹有夜深私語口脂香。開口便唱寃家的，歪腔，那裹有春風一曲杜韋娘。舉杯對吃燒刀子，難當，那裹有蘭陵美酒鬱金香。頭上鬆髻高尺二，蠻娘，那裹有高髻雲鬢宮樣妝。行雲行雨在何方，土坑，那裹有鴛鴦夜宿銷金帳。五錢一兩等頭昂，便忘，那裏有嫁得劉郎勝阮郞。</p>

<p>— 惟經</p>
<p>自殺是一種罪惡，這句話，我們是時常聽見的。自殺是犯罪行爲之一，這也是世界文明各國都有的一種法律。但是在倫敦，却有一個「速死會」，由若干有地位的醫學家，法學家，敎士等組織成功了。其目的，是保護有資格自殺者的脫離這個世界。他們的見解，是患有不治之症的人，與其任令其纏綿牀席，遲緩而痛苦地走向死亡的路上去，還不如賦與速死的法律上的權利，使之少受些將死的痛苦。</p>

<p>在這一個目標之下，該會的發起人之一，著名的醫學家毛尼亨爵士，準備向國會中提出一條法律，准許合於條件的請求速死的，用一種簡單而毫無痛苦的方法，結束生命。速死的必須具備的條件，是患有不治之症。在手續方面，須親筆簽一願死的瞪書。在簽字時，須有二個最近的親屬，二個有資格的醫生，親臨作證，而且也須簽名於願死證上，以證明該願死者，確是害着不治之症。這種公開而且合法的自殺，眞可說是曠古奇聞。自殺而有法律的保障，自殺者儘可從容就死，這未始不是自殺者的一個福音。但是觀乎這個速死會的組織的本旨，完全是以人道爲出發點的，所以求死者的資格，也只限於有不治之疾的。可知因經濟壓迫，戀愛失敗等等而自殺的，實在的尚無自殺之必要。這一點，尚希因一時衝動而厭世者，加以注意。</p>

<h3 id="c203">阿比西尼亞實地見聞 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>自從伊阿戰爭發生之後，阿比西尼亞這個國家，已是遐邇聞名了。一個誰都瞧不起的黑人國，而敢和歐洲人傑墨沙里尼的雄師，對抗一下，爲弱小民族吐一口氣，當然是雖敗允榮的。以下是日本外務書記官土田豐氏的談話，他在去年到過阿國考察，所談或者比較正確的</p>
<p>要到阿國去，最便利是乘船到佛領沙孟立蘭特的奇布企上岸，那裹有一條鐵路可以直接通達阿京。從車站出發，沿路都是沙漠，連三尺灌木，黑褐色的岩石也看不到的。火車奄奄一息的，爬上高原，在强烈的日光之下，如若不帶黑色眼鏡，休想看見東西。開了電扇，還是酷熱得時刻想喝水。到了阿國的奇奈敦，已高出海面五千尺了。四面都是綠樹，天氣也漸漸淸凉了。再向南便到阿淮希村，滿是瘧蚊，非用蚊帳不可。夜間只聞山下風和狼吠的聲音，可怕之至。土地漸漸的高起來，溫度漸降。到了阿京附近，一件襯衫再也耐不住了，只好穿起外套來。在車子中看見四圍紫色的山谷，中間一塊白色的建築集團，那是阿京，離海面已有八千尺了。</p>
<p>當火車直抵阿京時候忽而雷電交作，一陣大雨，這是阿比西尼亞的特產物。從五月至九月中是雨期，每天至少要降一二回的。雨霽日出，人民披着很厚的肩布，禦着日光。阿京因地勢很高，故夏天也和北溫帶的春秋一樣，十分溫和的，但空氣稀薄，這是缺點。</p>
<p>阿比西尼亞一名哀篤比亞，在菲洲東部，面積的三十五萬方哩，較日本本國爲大，人口雖說有一千萬，並不正確。建國的歷史巳近四千年。當時有從阿刺伯來遠征的希哀伯女王，做了阿國的統治者，因爲欽慕沿地中海岸的英雄沙龍夢大王的緣故，親自去拜訪。一宿歸來，產了一個王子，這便是阿國皇帝梅奈利克一世。所以至今阿國人民還自誇着說：「我們是大王和女王所生王子的子孫。」自梅奈利克一世起有二千年左右的皇統專制，到後來羣雄割據，紛紛謀叛起來。十九世紀時二世復興阿國，統一全國得着許多意大利的帮助，故以北部沿海地，割給意國。又因英法干涉，於是又把東北沿海地割給英法，而自己却沒有一條出海的通路了。所以二世雖可說是中興，也可說是引狼入室的禍首。後來果然起了叛逆，內戰不息。基督敎的大收師起來立二世的决女柴亞奇爲女王，由今阿國皇帝珊拉休攝政。一九二三年，位法國援助而入國際聯盟。一九三〇年女王崩，乃由珊拉休繼續國位。皇后名麥奈，育三男二女。阿國完全是封建制，各地酋長均招募着兵將，每三年聚集在阿京朝拜一次。國中三分之一是阿瑪拉族，乃是眞正阿國的血統。都信奉基督敎，是官吏佾侶武士等階級。此外是回敎徒和全無智識的黑奴，只能受人使喚的做着奴隸。</p>
<p>人民尚武好戰，是傳統的氣象。宴會時用了奇怪的樂器伴着，舞劍在歌。他們的歌大都是描寫阿特華戰勝意大利的故事。人民武士因爲祖上有大勝意國的光榮，所以都輕視羅馬勇士。其實現在的意大利，已遠非昔比，英法亦見之頭痛，而阿國人還是認爲自己一定可以和祖上一樣，戰敗意軍的。</p>
<p>親友間禮儀很重，在路上相見，也時常彼此問候。有時兩個人擁抱着，兩隻黑鬍子面孔，互相磨擦。上等社會吃牛羊等肉食，下層階級，只吃些鹹味的麵食罷了。</p>

<p>那女子的莫有二十二三的年紀，還不艱看，衣服也並不破爛，不過伊却儘向着西洋人住的牕格中乞求，巡捕跑來干涉，拉伊跑，伊不肯，趕伊回去，伊又說：我那裏有家呵！隨即又大聲的哭了起來！</p>
<p>公共汽車上下來了一個查票員，見是女人，便用電筒恒久的照射着，照射着伊的面龐，伊雖然有些羞怯，惱怒，但却沒的抗議的勇氣！</p>

<h3 id="c209">預防流行性感冒（俗稱傷風）方的法 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Prof．Dr．W．Berger等原著　陳生白節譯</p>
<p>（辰）對於易致戚冒者，像乳兒，妊婦，產婦，老人，恢復期病人，新經手術者，軟骨病，脊柱彎曲病，有循環器病者，猩紅熱和麻疹的病人。都應該禁止訪病或遠避流行地。至於在不良環境之下的使用防病面罩，隔離，服用奎寗。常然可以避免許多不幸事伴的發生的。</p>
<p>（己）參照Prausnitz氏的報吿。當感冒流行期對於病院，診所，官應的候待室的候待時間。有儘可能範圍內來縮短的必要。允其是在病院。因爲待診期間的機會而致感冒呈猖獗的傳染者有之。</p>
<p>（庚）醫院管理。對於流行性戚冒的團體預防上。也佔有重耍的地位。像</p>
<p>A醫院當局應該盡情報的義務對於一個流行性感冒者的住院。有引起傳染的危險。所以醫院當局要隨時顧慮之。</p>
<p>B病人的隔離</p>
<p>C重病允其是像肺炎或已死的肺炎患者的病房。應該要有嚴重的消毒。因爲流行性感冒和肺炎間。有密切的關係的啊。</p>
<p>D一般的禁止訪病　任何疾病或者至少有危險性的疾病。都應該防備它的傳染。當然流行性感冒也不外此例。不得已的時候。就像上面所說的一樣。要帶防病罩，淸潔手指和實施奎寗之內服等。</p>
<p>E懇切的宣傳勸導，隨時的監查，迅速的情報。奎寗，防病罩的使用。無論普通的民衆，也耍有切實施行的義務。醫院裹的醫生，看護婦，旣經處於指導的地位。更應該加緊應做的工作的。</p>
<p>由於上面各種方法的併用而所得的效果。吾人固無爭論的餘地。但是個人的精力如何。實施的徹底與吾。組織的技術和方法的適應與吾所影響於傳染預防的。也是很大的問題。</p>
<p>（乙）發病預防法</p>
<p>流行性感冒的傳染機會，旣這樣的多。而預防它的傳染又這樣的難。所以它的感染又是不能避免於萬一的。當旣經感染之後。怎樣可以預防發病。就應該注意下面的方針。</p>
<p>個人的預防發病</p>
<p>（子）應該嚴重的防備受寒，過勞，營養不足和塵埃，吸烟等足以組成發病的誘因。</p>
<p>（丑）奎寗內服預防法　藥物預防上最有效力的，幾經學者的實騐。到現在爲止。還認奎寗爲第一。奎寗之於流行性感冒巳和於瘧疾相同。得到預防與治療上的價値。</p>
<p>A奎寗預防法的時間和持續</p>
<p>流行期一經開始。倘使就內服奎寗。直到不發現新病的報吿爲止。當然是最好的辦法。至於散在性或持續性流行的。也應該有繼續服用的必要。共他爲了職業的關係。或者特別對於感冒發作的斷續而無寗日者。就要終年或從十二日起到四日爲止的服用了。</p>
<p>又所謂短期預防法者。那是對於不能避免的訪病，同事間的輕症戚冒，聚會於流行地的應急的處置。</p>
<p>B藥劑的選擇要合乎舒適，易服，不磚胃口的原則。像Quinisal（Cbin，BisalicBoehringer　0.25）．Chininperlen＂Zimmer＂（0.05-0.1　und　0.2　ChinHydrrochl　puriss）等。至於奎寗的單獨服用或和水楊酸（Acid　Salicyl）製劑服用時。那一個比較有效。還有待於另行報告。</p>
<p>C用量有用大量的。每天〇·二五－〇·五。有用小量的。每天〇·五。</p>
<p>D副作用　照我們所用的奎寗，水楊酸各〇·二五的預防法。很少有副作用的發生。</p>
<p>（寅）其他藥物的發病預防法</p>
<p>AKleinert　氏Salicyl．＆Urotropin</p>
<p>BH．Berg氏碘劑的預防法</p>
<p>CSpitta氏Protargol的鼻腔滴入法。都有相當的功效。</p>
<p>D由於口腔的淸潔（Panflavin，Formamint等的含嗽和消毒藥水的洗滌）據所得致的效果。恐怕不大可靠。</p>
<p>（卯）特殊免疫的預防發病法雖然還沒有經過科學的嚴密的證實。但却是有使用的價値。可惜本法持續作用不能十分延長。所以要有反覆接種的必要。</p>
<p>所謂混合接種苗者。是指許多足以引起感冒的已死細菌所做成的。據一般經騐所及。好像沒有什麼了不起的作用</p>
<p>團體的預防發病</p>
<p>防備發生感冒的團體預防法。不光是限定於上面所說的傳染預防的法則。同時官廳方面也應該。通盤籌劃。去研究怎樣避免發病的誘因。像保煖的裝置。營養的供給等是。</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>關於流行性感冒的預防法。雖然還不止這些。但是倘使能够實行上面所講的主要的方針，一定可以减輕感冒的發作。縮小感冒的傳染勢力的。末了。再想鄭重聲明的。就是除掉防病罩子，禁止訪病，隔離等等方法外。一個輕而易舉的內服奎寗預防法。對於傳染預防允其是發病預防。因爲有確鑿的功效。所以有再向讀者作有力的介紹。（完）</p>

<p>第三節　齒槽膿漏症</p>
<p>（第八七問）非傳染性牙根膜炎的症候怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）普通的症候，已經在上面第七八問內講過，一切病象，都沒有急性傳染性的那樣劇烈。不過牙根膜起輕度的充血發炎，牙齒稍爲高起酸痛。但若久不治愈，多易受傳染而致化膿，症候變劇。</p>
<p>（第八八問）齒糟膿漏症是怎樣一種病？</p>
<p>（答）齒槽膿漏症，我國俗名呌做牙疳。牠雖然也有牙根膜的炎症，但和上面第二節所講過的完全不同。牙齒本身大都完好，並沒有什麼變化。不過牙床骨逐漸萎縮，牙肉縫裹，常會有一種膿液流出。若不醫治，牙齒就會漸漸鬆動，自然脫落。而且此病發生後，往往不限於一齒，鄰近牙齒，往往現同樣病態，終至脫落。這種病很爲普通，牙齒因此喪失的着實不少。所以牠和蛀牙及蛀牙所引起牙髓牙膜炎等疾病可算牙患中最普通最有害的兩大類疾病。牙醫生的工夫，大半都消耗於醫治這兩類疾病</p>
<p>（第八九問）齒槽膿漏症的原因是什麼？</p>
<p>（答）原因很爲複雜，而且還有十分確定。大槪多由於唾液內所含的石灰質，和食屑等，黏附於牙頸部分。堆積旣久，漸結成如石硬的一層汚物。這就呌做齒石（牠也可由血液排洩物積成的）。因爲這齒石的刺激，牙肉就會充血發炎，日久與牙齒分離而成一囊袋。微菌汚物侵入，遂成膿漏之症。但牠也可因全身疾病。如花柳病糖尿病肺病神經衰弱等而引起的。</p>
<p>（第九〇問）齒槽膿漏症可分做幾種？</p>
<p>（答）可分做三種，各種的症候稍有不同。</p>
<p>（第九一問）第一種的症候怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）牙頸周圍附有一圈黑硬的齒石。牙肉邊綠部分，紅腫發炎。此症程度較淺，爲齒槽膿漏症的初期。囊袋多未形成；膿汁亦無者居多。</p>

<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>第六節　專門性的刺激治療——鐵勃固靈</p>
<p>鐵勃固靈是什麼，及對於本症診斷方面之價値，這種種情形，已在本書第八章裹面詳述過了！但他除開診斷方面外，對於本症之治療，也有絕大之價値的：甚至有許多人主張，如果應用得當，簡直可算作專門特效治療而無愧的！我們曉得，鐵勃固靈是用結核桿菌毒素製成的，故又有結核菌素之名；如果注入人體，對於病灶炎症狀態，係有很大之變化的，最輕微的是病灶部分增加紅腫，劇烈一點，可使病灶部分崩壞。所以他在原理方面，係能够直接達到病灶的；和其他提高人身之生活力，以抵抗病菌蔓延之種種方法，當然不可同樣看待了。</p>
<p>但原理雖然如此，事實上並不能如此做的；如果貿然一决注入大量於人體，不錯，病灶部分或且能够崩壞了，但劇烈的全身反應也隨之而起的；在這方面所發生的，像高熱，頭痛，惡心，嘔吐，等種種，與病者身體自不能無損害的。甚至因此而可發生生命危險的。</p>
<p>那末，他在本症治療一方面，應該怎樣下手方妥呢？他是根據自動免疫的定例，應用於病者，以達治療之目的。其法以極小分量開始，嗣後緩緩逐漸增加，以至大量的。這一種辦法，可使病者漸漸與藥力相習；劑量漸增，則藥力日大，病者之抵抗力亦日大，本身器官亦因與日强；抵抗結核菌毒蔓延之力量，當然亦因以增加的。此種劑量，如果患者有良好的適應性，最後可增加至半公分或一公分的。但最初的劑量，不過合十萬分之光景，可見得用量多寡，前後相差之鉅了！所以病者接受此種治療，需期是狠長久的。大槪每一量所需的時期，至少須三月，尋常則大槪是六月，或延至一年之久的。如果小滿三月，在治療方面是毫無價値的。鐵勃固靈之用法，尋常以皮下注射予績爲最宜；大槪每星期二决，用大量時祇能一决。如果發生反應，則下决劑量决對不能增加，至多限量，以維持上决之注射劑呈　度。除開皮下注射手續外，也有用皮內注射手續者，另外邊有皮內接種　油　摩擦兩種方法：但都沒有皮下注射那樣普通，醫者臨床上採用者也比較少，所以此處也一慨從略了！</p>

<p>「甘露」藥水。中外馳名。無論患者醫者。均已公認為皮膚病治療劑之牛耳。功效之著。無與倫比。史三立君。患乾癬殆六七年。屢醫無效。雖聞有奏效於一時。然經過若干時日。又復發出。金錢虛擲。痛苦備甞。今年五月。訪余治療。余見其結痂纍纍。血痕斑斑。遍體無完膚。遂囑其購「甘露」塗治。不數日間。竟獲出余意表之功效。約連塗二星期。竟將數載之痼疾。一旦消滅凈盡。迄茲七月。未甞再發。有此靈藥。患皮膚病者。可以高枕無憂矣。（按「甘露」藥水。為上海法租界。西新橋街德行里一號。同仁西藥社精良出品。原料高貴。藥力正確。行銷已來。幾遍國內。價每瓶一元。）</p>

<h3 id="c223">從小販割股療親說起 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>在七日的本埠報上，看到如下的一節新聞：揚州人劉鴻新，年廿二歲，業藤箱小販，住居櫻華里，鴻新有母黃氏，年四十八歲，向有胃氣痛病，時發時愈，此次黃氏舊病復發，忽轉沉重，纏綿床褥，呻吟不已，劉鴻新因甞閱小書，深知有割股療親之事，於前晚十一時，身懷利刃，潛往小沙渡路空地上，將左臂割肉一塊，約有二寸，其時會有西捕巡邏經過，見其手執利刃，形跡可疑，拘至捕房，後經劉鴻新將割股醫親之情形陳明，見其左臂受傷，送醫院包紮，傷勢無碍。</p>
<p>劉鴻新確稱得起是一個孝子。他看到母親舊病復發，忽轉沉重，為治療計，竟不惜痛楚用利刃將自己的左臂，割肉一塊。這在常人是不易做出來的。但劉鴻新的一片孝心，雖然可嘉，他畢竟是一個愚孝子，不明白母親有病，應該就醫診治，非一塊肉所能使她痊好。然他之所以割肉，亦不是憑空想出來的法子，要以肉代藥，云試治母親的胃氣痛病，却分蝗是從書中學到的。原來他平時嘗閱讀小書，深知古人有「割股療親」的故事，故自己也為孝心所驅，學做一個孝子。那裏知道結果本身割肉傷痛不打緊，於母親的疾病，亦絲毫沒有裨益。而且又因手執利刃，形跡可疑，給西捕拘至捕房訉問一番。如劉鴻新者，眞可謂「其孝可嘉，其愚不可及」。</p>
<p>然在這里我們所要提出來說的，並非想地劉鴻新加以褒獎，給他掛上一個「孝子」的美名，以揚仁風，而挽頹俗。我們所應注意的，倒是文字影響力的重大。從前我們曾聽見有三個做學徒的，因看過「江湖奇俠傳」一類的小說，一時竟着起迷來，相偕入山訪道求仙，仿學奇俠的故事。還有不久刺殺孫傳芳的施劍翹，這個孝女之為父報仇，依她自己的吿白，是因閱讀聊齋「商三官」一段的故事，深印入腦中，以為故事雖屬假造，但事實非不可能，故乃决心云行刺，做出一回驚動社會的事。卽她所散傳單詩中「父仇未敢片時忘」一句，亦係抄用聊齋「于江」篇的原句。由這幾件事實，我們便可以看出文字感運輸隊之深。一本「奇俠傳」，能呌三個學徒，入山訪道求仙。一段「聊齋誌異」，能使喚一個女子，為父報仇。一節「割股療親」故事，能誘一個小販，割一塊肉治母病。文字影響力的重大，竟有如此驚人者。</p>
<p>對於這一點，一般從事敎育及文化的人，應如何加以留意。我國近今雖受外來新思想的洗禮，但社會上封建意識，仍甚普遍。我們今後要剷除這種舊勢力，須從文化方面着想，使人人建立一正確而合於現代生活的意識。當局對於我國的文化界，應下一番檢視的工作，凡不適於今日者，盡數予以掃滅。如是，社會上一切不合理的行為，或可望其逐漸减少。我們一見市上許多不良書本的流行，眞覺十分危險。</p>

<p>— 黑丁</p>
<p>冬天。</p>
<p>冷風括着靠近在吉拉林河下游的達呼爾人住的巴拉瑪村，已有些死沉沉的冷漠的景象了。茫無涯際的山野，發白的鋪滿了一層很厚的雪。吉拉林河像一條很寬很寬的白帶子，蜿蜒的，靜止的躺在噶哈山的左邊。</p>
<p>是剛剛吃過午飯的時候，五下歲的老頭子魯支索和着他的一個十歲的孫子比亞，冷顫顫地趕着犬撬從刺崑山的山道走回。比亞一張小小的臉蛋兒通紅通紅的，活像喝了幾杯酒。他的腦袋瓜子戴着一頂肥大的長毛的狗皮帽子。兩隻眼睛給遮得幾乎要不瞧見面前的道路了。他一邊走，一邊用藏在皮手包里的手使勁地往腦袋頂上推。又是鼓着嘴腮，皺起鼻樑子，呶噥的罵：</p>
<p>—我把你娘娘的…</p>
<p>那帽子被推得幾乎要掉下來。</p>
<p>魯支索從背在脊樑上的一個皮囊里掏出一枝旱烟袋來，按上烟，擦拉的一聲劃着火柴，就啵啵地抽起來。他聽見比亞在呶噥的罵，於是，他便張開了枯燥的嘴唇，就咕咕嘰嘰的：</p>
<p>—早上說是不讓你戴它，你便不聽。媽媽不是也吿訴你嗎，你也不聽。再這樣，不許你跟我出來。今天要不是你跟來，那隻老狐貍還會逃了嗎？都是你，都是你…</p>
<p>比亞給爺這一頓咕嘰，他一陣就不高興起來，滿臉掛上一層怒色。他賭氣的在爺爺的頭前急步的走，低垂着腦袋，什麽也無心去理睬了。</p>
<p>離着村子還有幾十步距遠，在河邊上站着三個老年人，呱拉的談着話。那三個人其中有魯支索的鄰人巴斯克，還有兩個是從別處來的。當巴斯克一見魯支索從山道上走來，他揚着手，提高了喉嚨，這麽呌：</p>
<p>—喂，老魯哥，你走運了吧？準是又打了不少？</p>
<p>這聲音傳進魯支索的耳朶里，却使他猛然仰起臉來，看了一看，遂卽擺動着手掌，現出很喪氣的樣子來，一邊走，一邊回答：</p>
<p>—走運？再走運連犬撬就要拉不回來！</p>
<p>咳嗽了一聲，停了一回，便接着道：</p>
<p>—都是比亞這孩子，若不是他跟去，那隻老狐貍總算我不能讓牠逃掉的！哼，還走運，你看犬撬這不空着回來了。</p>
<p>—這眞是，這眞是…</p>
<p>巴斯克再三的嘆息着。</p>
<p>魯支索已經走近巴斯克的跟前。他站住脚步，便朝着靠在巴斯克左邊那兩個老年人微笑的看了幾眼。接着，他對巴斯克這麽問：</p>
<p>—這兩位？</p>
<p>又向那兩個老年會意的笑了笑，</p>
<p>這當，巴斯克正伸出手去握着比亞的手腕，張開他那一張剛吃過酒的嘴，噴出一口怪難聞的酒臭來，却醉醺醺的說：</p>
<p>—嘿，十歲就能跟爺爺上山去打獵，眞是一個能幹的小傢伙呵。</p>
<p>嘴里還不時的發着笑聲。</p>
<p>巴斯克聽到魯支索向他問，趕忙回過臉去，用着一種鎭靜的態度，與急迫的口音，便把那兩個老年人，給魯支索介紹了一遍：</p>
<p>—這位是泌頓庫，這位是柴司太。他們是從格蕯鎭來的，</p>
<p>魯支索點着頭，做出熱情的樣子，殷勤的便向那兩個老年人這麽問：</p>
<p>—呵，呵，這麽遠路，兩位來一定是有事的吧？</p>
<p>還沒等他們開口，巴斯克很快的插上嘴：</p>
<p>—你不知道呵，格蕯爾鎭也敎×</p>

<p>×兵佔了！是昨天剛佔的，他們兩位是從鎭上逃出來的呀！</p>
<p>魯來索打了一個冷顫。啞聲的發起楞來，老半天，他才慢吞吞的在喉嚨里：</p>
<p>——噢，是逃出來的……</p>
<p>似乎是想了想，却有些憤怒的意味嘆了幾聲：</p>
<p>——唉，天地改變了！這眞是大災大禍呀！××兵怎麼佔了那，又來奪這……</p>
<p>這空氣再不能安靜下去了。於是，剛才由巴斯克介紹過的泌頓庫，不自覺的便握起拳頭來，又瞪大了眼珠子，惡恨恨的在說：</p>
<p>——昨天鎭上亂極了！××兵是從吉拉林開去的，有二百多呀！一開到鎭，就把鎭上所有的住戶一家一的搜遍了。並且把鎭上所有的槍械都沒收得乾凈了。還有一個風聲，說等幾天連我們獵人用的土槍也要沒收呢。</p>
<p>魯支索被嚇得喘了一口粗氣，嘴里亦是：</p>
<p>——怎麼，怎麼，連我們獵人用的土槍也要……</p>
<p>泌頓庫從度袍子里摸出一枝旱烟　來，抽着烟，又：</p>
<p>——這眞是沒法子，我們還指着什麼生活呢！唉！唉……聽說近來古拉林那一帶也很亂，增加不少的××兵，都說他們要預備和大鼻子國（註）打仗，也不知眞假……現在災難又臨到我們眼前了！鎭上的人今天都跑光了。因爲在今天早上，有兩個××兵死在大街上，滿身都是血，看樣子那是在昨晚上讓人打死的……還沒等泌頓庫說完，沉默了半天的柴司太，却焦急的樣子搶着說</p>
<p>——今天鎭上簡直像塌下天來似的，××兵捉了不少的人去，有索倫人，有鄂倫人，也有畢喇爾人，捉去的不問皂白都殺了，××兵還說我們要造反，其實他們正在造反呀！他們不讓我們活……</p>
<p>——諾啞，諾啞……（註三）</p>
<p>遠遠的透過來幾聲女人的嘆息。接着就能聽見女人喚孩子的聲音了。</p>
<p>這時，擁在鎭兩頭的河泳上那一大羣玩要的，拉爬犂的，滑冰的孩子們，偶然聽到這一種野火似的驚人的捎息，個個被嚇得改變了臉色，着眼老老實實站　脚？像失掉了靈魂似的。有的在喉　里沙啞呌着：</p>
<p>——呵呀！××兵來了！我們往那里跑呢？</p>
<p>孩子都跑回家去了。</p>
<p>比亞趕着犬撬也跑回家去了。</p>
<p>魯支索一張蒼白的臉子，浮着一層陰沉的悒鬱的色彩。半晌，他像從惡夢里驚醒過來似的，硬着喉嚨，這麼喃喃着：</p>
<p>——那麼，那麼，這要怎麼辦呢？假若我們的獵槍眞被沒收去，那我們還有活路嗎？……</p>
<p>聲音發抖，好一回，他又：</p>
<p>——巴斯克，你說××兵能不能再從格薩鎭開到我們這里來了？</p>
<p>巴斯克搖了搖腦袋，說不知道。同時，泌頓庫，和柴司太，異口同聲的說</p>
<p>——這誰敢担保呢。人家要佔那兒，就佔那兒，誰敢當得住……</p>
<p>忽然，遠遠的被一陣風吹來一種哀厲的喊聲：</p>
<p>——造反的年頭！諾啞！諾啞！……</p>
<p>這是魯支索的老婆子伊沙亞從家里急急忙忙的跑到街上，這麼咕咕噥噥的嘆息着。她隔着魯支索還有那麼距遠，就慌慌張張的大聲問：</p>
<p>——是嗎？××兵把格薩爾鎭佔了？</p>
<p>魯支索裝做沒有聽見似的，他無心答理她，只是自己在發愁。</p>
<p>伊沙亞站下了。</p>
<p>巴斯克瞧了瞧伊沙亞，他把眼睛一瞪，嘴唇一裂，就：</p>
<p>——恐怕也會開到我們這里來的……</p>
<p>諾啞，啞諾！這怎麼好？我快回家去求菩薩保佑……</p>
<p>伊沙亞一邊咕噥着，一跛一拐地走回家去了。</p>
<p>魯支索默默的，跟在老婆子伊沙亞的屁股後遜，走着，走着。</p>
<p>黃昏。巴拉瑪村死寂了，街上沒有一個人走。</p>
<p>深夜。巴拉瑪村更死寂了，街上括着猛烈的風。</p>
<p>魯支索沒有睡，他靜靜的跪在菩薩的面前，撐起沉重的困倦的眼皮兩隻憂鬱的眼珠子，一轉一轉的，嘴里：</p>
<p>——咖咖！（註三）保佑巴拉瑪村，保佑我們獵人……</p>

<p>海笑的時候，我沉醉了，我的心給跳躍着的水珠帶了去，我像跌在偉大慈愛的海裏；海怒的時候，我低頭了，我感覺到我自身的渺小，在這偉大的海之前。</p>
<p>而也在這時候，我禁不住流起淚來。我被感動，我祇有流淚；除了流淚，我還能些什麼呢？</p>
<p>海又在咆哮了，還夾着血服的風，我的眼腔又感到一陣熱。這一决，我又將被感動得流　了，然而也將在這一决，我除了流淚之外，還要把渺小的自己投到偉大的海裏去，去流一滴血，因爲我知道，偉大的海原是無數渺小的自己積成的。</p>

<p>「刦後桃花」是戲劇家洪深先生的創作，曾在「文學」上發表，該戲以靑島爲背景，是一部根據歷史事實而演化出來的美妙的影劇。前淸光緒二十三年，德國藉口敎士被殺，遣艦佔領膠州灣，奪爲「租借地」；數十年刻意經營，靑島遂成商業要埠，軍事重鎭。</p>
<p>環繞着靑島諸山，都造有砲台，碧草綠樹間，暗藏着十餘寸口徑的重砲——且又依山沿海修築了平坦大道通行四達。至於市內，更無一處不是華麗的建築，高大的洋房，顯得是十分繁勝的景像，辛亥革命後，遜淸遺老，亡國大夫，喜此地有外國勢力的庇護，視該地爲「今桃花源」；移家卜居，紛紛而至，都預備終老是鄉，可是好長不常，民國三年秋，歐洲大戰，靑島遂爲日帝國全義所奪，「鬼和鬼打架」，不用說吃虧的是咱半殖民地的中國人。於是一些遜淸遺老，亡國大夫的悲劇便發生了。「刦後桃花」並指示出半殖民地的中國人民的求生存的問題，在這動亂的時代中。</p>

<p>Nanjing. The National Government held a weekly memorial service on the morning of the 13th. Deng Jiayan, Wang Boqun, Cheng Qian, Chen Shaokuan, Chen Daqi, Wang Musong, Chen Xunyong, Yu Feipeng, Chen Qicai, Lu Chao, Wei Huai, and 500 other officials from various departments of the National Government attended. Chairman Lin led the ceremony and delivered a speech entitled "Serving with All Our Might." The ceremony concluded at 10:30 AM. (13th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing. Chairman Lin's speech at the National Government's weekly memorial service on the morning of the 13th first explained in detail the meaning of the late Premier's instructions, "The greater the intelligence and ability, the more one should serve the needs of thousands and create blessings for thousands; the smaller the intelligence and ability, the more one should serve the needs of hundreds and create blessings for hundreds." He resolutely said that to implement these words of the late Premier, we must first have a sense of responsibility and a sense of tranquility and then explained them separately. Responsibility: Mencius said, "Yu thought of those drowning in the world as if he himself were drowning, and Ji thought of those starving in the world as if he himself were starving." He also said, "Yi Yin thought of those in the world who were not blessed by him as if he himself had pushed them into a ditch." It can be seen that when Yu, Ji, and Yi Yin were handling affairs, they were always thinking that they had not done their duty. Now, China's economy is backward, the people are poor, and there are disasters and floods, which have caused great losses to the people. The government must relieve the people's suffering and do its best to take responsibility and move forward. The country's politics is complicated, and it cannot be accomplished by one person alone. It must be accomplished by intelligent and capable people who work together and fulfill their responsibilities under the guidance of the entire government. Tranquility: The Great Learning takes calmness, stillness, peace, and deliberation as the foundation of illuminating virtue. Zhuge Wuhou said, "Tranquility clarifies ambition, and quietness leads to far-reaching goals." Those who have accomplished great things and established great achievements in ancient times must have considerable self-cultivation and not be concerned with comfort, wealth, and honor. The late Premier said that people should aim to serve, not to seize. If one aims to seize, one's desire for power will be strong, and one will inevitably forget the public and seek private gain. He concluded that the late Premier took the revival of the nation and the salvation of the world as his mission, devoted his life to it, and never gave up despite all the setbacks. His great courage and benevolence are a model for our party.

If we do our best as individuals, the government's ability will definitely increase. (13th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e13">The Activity of Japanese Military Personnel in North China <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Our government can be said to have made its utmost effort to maintain Sino-Japanese peace. Initially, it yielded to the extraordinary situation in North China and established the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee. Subsequently, it formally proposed to Japan to convene a Sino-Japanese National Relations Adjustment Conference in Beijing to seek the return of Sino-Japanese diplomacy to normalcy. However, not only did such efforts fail to gain the slightest understanding from the Japanese military, they even intensified their efforts to further divide our territory, deepening the division between the Chinese and Japanese nations. The occupation of six counties in Chahar Province by the pseudo-army of Li Shouxin and the pseudo-Mongolian security forces, the occupation of Tanggu Military Grain City by the pseudo-security forces of Zhao Lei, and the military, economic, and transportation agreements between the traitor Yin Rugeng and the pseudo-Manchukuo were all obviously the result of the Japanese military's instigation. In addition, there have been several local disputes created by the Japanese military in North China as pretexts for provocation. Recently, according to Tokyo telecommunications, the Japanese military is planning to submit its proposals on foreign policy to the Diet. The content states that the army will ensure the security of North China, which borders "Manchukuo," and promote the happiness of local residents. Therefore, it will also adopt a supportive stance towards the "automatic movement of the people." From the past actions of Japanese military personnel in North China and the Japanese military's decision to restore the Qingji garrison and increase the Pingjin garrison, we can see that what they call ensuring the security of North China is actually an attempt to control North China by force, and what they call promoting the happiness of local residents is actually an attempt to promote their anesthetizing policies among our local compatriots. As for the so-called "automatic movement of the people," it has already been exemplified by Yin Rugeng's pseudo-autonomous movement, which is a smoke bomb to divide our territory and is known to the whole world. The people of the whole country should not regard this kind of "autonomous" farce as a national shame and resolve to eradicate it.</p>
<p>Now, the notorious Doihara has returned to Tianjin to engage in activities. Will the ugly farce of the pseudo-autonomous movement become even more widespread? Last November, the noisy pseudo-autonomous movement in the five provinces was finally eliminated due to the clear understanding of our several generals. This is something that Doihara and his ilk could not be reconciled to. Yesterday, Doihara arrived in Tianjin, and the Tianjin Japanese military headquarters held a secret meeting. Japanese military officers such as Sakagaki and Isoya were also traveling busily between Qingdao, Jinan, Pingjin. In light of the Japanese military's stated position on the North China issue, there are some hints that the above movement will be revived.</p>
<p>The new Japanese ambassador to China, Arita, is about to arrive in China. It seems that the Sino-Japanese governments are making efforts to adjust their national relations, but the Japanese military is spreading seeds of resentment in North China at this time. Is this not the biggest obstacle to the adjustment of national relations? Therefore, whether the adjustment negotiations can be realized depends on how the Japanese government stops the activities of the Japanese military in North China as a prerequisite.</p>

<h3 id="e19">New York Silver Company Announces: US Silver Purchase Plan a Complete Failure, Only Subsidizing Domestic Silver Producers, Futilely Disrupting International Finance <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>New York - Handy &amp; Harman, brokers who set the daily silver price in New York, released their annual report today, stating that the US government's silver purchase plan has been a complete failure. Therefore, the company recommends that the US gradually withdraw from the silver market. In 1935, the price of silver fluctuated greatly, and now silver has been reduced from a precious metal to an ordinary commodity. The only success of the US Silver Purchase Act of 1934 was to provide domestic silver merchants with huge subsidies, but it has caused financial imbalances abroad and lost other countries' goodwill towards the US. In fact, such subsidies could be provided in other, more convenient ways, the company said. The company suggests finding a way to create a global demand for silver. However, to achieve this goal, the silver purchase law may need to be amended or repealed. If Congress cannot take this action, it can only be hoped that it will allow the Treasury Department to handle it in accordance with the original intention of the law, that is, with public interests as the premise, and not just consider the interests of those who demand to raise the price to $1.29. Last year, the Treasury Department did its best to purchase silver, but in reality, there was still no progress, because the number the Treasury should have purchased was 1.38 billion ounces. However, after absorbing 84.3 million ounces as much as possible for 19 months, the final settlement at the end of last year still fell short of the target by 107.5 million ounces compared to the government's gold reserves. Now, the two most important silver-using regions in the world, China and Hong Kong, have abandoned the silver standard, and other places are also showing a trend of abandonment. Although US silver purchases can standardize exchange rates to prevent the appreciation of the US dollar, from this standpoint, silver is only a commodity. US trade with China has been greatly reduced due to the impact of the US silver purchase plan on China, and the goodwill towards the US that has been cultivated for many years has also been lost once and for all.</p>
<h3 id="e20">US Senator Announces Easing of Silver Purchases Due to Preventing Japanese Smuggling <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Washington - Democratic Senator King claimed today that the US is now easing its silver purchase policy because of the Japanese smuggling silver exports, which is harming the Nanjing government. Since the US eased its silver purchases, the price of silver has fallen, and the Japanese smuggling of silver has completely stopped. Chang Ji said that if countries can use silver, the price of silver will naturally increase normally, and smuggling will not occur, and speculative activities in London, Shanghai, Mumbai and other places will not be induced. London's daily revision of silver prices in the past few years is the reason for the current drop in silver prices. The British policy on silver is harmful and useless. He also said that South American countries will add silver, and many other countries will also use silver as currency. He also said that since his trip to the East, he deeply knows the harm of silver speculation. As far as he knows, a certain bank in Shanghai has made a huge profit of US$17 million in silver speculation. Finally, King claimed that since the US eased silver purchases, Chinese silver speculators have lost their coats, and he firmly believes that our country will adopt a policy of taking away their underwear to teach them a lesson.

<p>London - The price of the US dollar fluctuated in the foreign exchange market this morning. There are currently two different opinions. Europe expects that the US dollar will depreciate soon, but London believes that although President Roosevelt has extended his power to depress the currency value, it is only used as a temporary self-defense tool, and will only use its power when foreign exchange is greatly unfavorable to the US export position. Therefore, when the European dollar selling trend stopped, London's purchases could raise the common price. When the dollar price rose, the European selling trend would start again.

<p>Paris - The bill on banning political groups of a military nature was passed by the Senate and the House of Representatives at the end of last year and has been signed by the President into law. The contents are as follows: (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>The government gazette is expected to be published, divided into three items: The following organizations are ordered to be dissolved: (A) Any group that causes armed demonstrations on the streets in any factual matter; (B) Any sports and sports associations of a military nature, except for military training groups approved by the government, that have the nature of private combat teams or civilian armies; (C) Any group whose purpose is to harm the territorial integrity of France or the republican system. After the dissolution of the above-mentioned organizations, if anyone attempts to maintain or directly or indirectly restore them, the participants will be imprisoned for six months to two years and fined up to 5,000 francs. All uniforms, symbols, badges, weapons and various military equipment of the above-mentioned organizations will be confiscated, and all their movable property will be liquidated.</p>
<p>At the same time, the government gazette also published a law on banning the illegal possession of weapons, stipulating that any person who carries weapons or objects that endanger public safety in public gatherings or demonstrations, whether hidden on their person or exposed to the outside, will be sentenced to imprisonment for three months to two years and fined up to 1,000 francs.

<p>Berlin - Today is the forty-third birthday of Prussian Prime Minister and Central Aviation Minister General Goering. The National Theater held a dance party to celebrate. The grand occasion was unprecedented since Emperor Wilhelm left the country in November 1918. More than 2,000 guests attended, and those who were not known by the Goering couple were not allowed to buy tickets to enter the venue. The stage was decorated into a huge flower pavilion, with fountains in the four corners, and the shimmering silk and satin laid on the four walls and corridors above and below stretched for several miles. Dozens of people in red uniforms held lanterns and lined up inside the courtyard on the left and right. Famous figures in Berlin, except for the leader Hitler and Propaganda Minister Dr. Goebbels, all attended. Former Crown Prince Wilhelm wore a commando uniform, the Fourth Prince wore a stormtrooper uniform, and former King Ferdinand of Bulgaria sat in the box. Goering himself wore a German Air Force uniform, and his wife, former opera star Connie Mann, and the daughter of the King of Italy, Mafalda, and her husband, Prince Philip of Hesse, shared a box. Outside the box were stationed a row of members of Hitler's famous Black Guard. British Ambassador Sir Phipps and almost all ambassadors and ministers from various countries stationed in Berlin attended, all in formal dress. (Reuters, 12th)</p>

<p>Paris - The Fascist Supreme Administrative Council was originally scheduled to meet on January 18, but it has now been postponed to February 1. According to a telegram from the Paris Daily News' Geneva correspondent today, the reason for the postponement is to give Aloisi the opportunity to continue negotiations with the British and French representatives on the Abyssinian issue. In order to realize the conciliation procedure, Italy must agree to expand the powers of the League of Nations' investigation committee so that it can not only investigate the methods of the war in Ethiopia, but also seek remedies to deal with the current situation. The British government intends to propose a ceasefire of six to eight weeks when discussing the issue in Geneva, so that the work of the committee can proceed smoothly. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>London - The issue of an oil embargo against Italy seems to be raised in Geneva within a week, and rumors are rife in European capitals that steps will be taken to end the East African War soon. The front lines have been relatively quiet recently, and the Italian army has not achieved significant victories, so many critics speculate that Mussolini may not refuse to consider peace talks. However, there are various opinions on which country is willing to act as a mediator. Queen Mother of Belgium recently visited her daughter, the Crown Princess of Italy, so the general public believes that Belgium may propose a peace agreement soon. The Daily Express reported that it is rumored in Brussels that the country will propose a new peace plan in Geneva soon, but this statement has been denied by Belgian Prime Minister Theunis. At the same time, the Italian newspaper published an article by Gayda, which said that implementing an oil embargo against Italy would fall within the scope of military sanctions and would be an open act of provocation against Italy. British cabinet members on vacation are now returning to Beijing one after another. A cabinet meeting will be held this week, and the oil embargo issue will be considered. At the same time, the general public is paying attention to the speech to be delivered by Foreign Secretary Eden on Friday. Eden has decided to leave for Geneva on the first day of the week to represent the United Kingdom at the meeting of the League of Nations' Committee of Eighteen. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>Paris - Exelsior's Rome correspondent recently sent out a message from that place, saying, "The diplomatic envoys of countries directly related to resolving the Italian-Ethiopian dispute, such as British Ambassador to Italy Sir Drummond, French Ambassador to Italy Chamberlin, and Italian Ambassador to France Cerutti, have all left their posts and returned to their countries. According to rumors in Rome, this is because of the trend of the times, and there is a need to conduct important discussions with their respective governments, so they have all returned to their countries to report on their duties. It is now heard that Sir Drummond intends to shorten his vacation and return to his post, and the diplomatic circles in Rome believe that the above-mentioned rumors seem to have confirmed that they are not false. The general public also believes that the reason why Sir Drummond returned to his post quickly before the expiration of his vacation must be because of the major events that are about to occur in the turbulent international situation. However, what do the so-called major events refer to? The League of Nations Committee of Eighteen, which will meet on the 20th of this month, will accept the request to intensify sanctions, which is not easy to say." (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>Geneva - Regarding the dispute between Italy and Ethiopia, it is rumored that the Council of the League of Nations will propose a new reconciliation plan during this session. Important personnel from the Secretariat of the League of Nations and delegations from various countries recently told our correspondent that they do not believe this statement, and said that in 1932, the League of Nations sent the Lytton Commission to China to investigate the Sino-Japanese dispute, but the results were not achieved. Now, the League of Nations personnel have never considered sending a similar investigation team to Ethiopia. The reason for this is not only because of the Lytton Commission's past experience, but also because they do not want to change their previous resolutions. These rumors originated in Rome, or were issued by the Italian government to restrain the actions of the League of Nations. Whenever the Council of the League of Nations or the Committee of Eighteen of the General Assembly of the League of Nations met, similar rumors would occur, and their role is self-evident. It should be known that the time is not yet ripe for any new reconciliation attempts. (Havas, 13th)</p>

Since the Vienna riots in February 1934 (organized by the Social Democratic Party), after the peace, the Catholic Party in power in Austria and the Democratic Party in power in the Czech Republic have had some misunderstandings between them. Today's meeting can eliminate doubts. As for the issue of the restoration of the old Habsburg royal family, the general public believes that the Prime Minister will not mention it during his visit to Prague. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<h3 id="e26">There is a Major Turning Point in the Naval Conference: Britain Negotiates Separately with Various Countries <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>London - The naval conference will have a major turning point after the Japanese government's reply arrives. British representatives plan to negotiate separately with representatives of various countries on the 13th to decide the direction of the proceedings of a certain committee on the 14th (Allied Telegraph, 12th)</p>
<p>London - As a result of the 12-night meeting, the two plenipotentiaries, Nagano and Nagai, have met with the British plenipotentiary and decided to prevent the deterioration of the international situation. They intend to implement the agreement in accordance with this policy. However, the Japanese side believes that if the Japanese proposal is rejected, it will inevitably withdraw from the meeting. Therefore, it first negotiates with the British side to find ways to delay the adoption of the Japanese proposal, and after Japan withdraws from the meeting, it signs a four-nation agreement, placing Japan in a separate position. Such situations must be avoided as much as possible to avoid the other party shifting responsibility to Japan and to seek the best policy. Britain keenly feels that the relations with Japan in China need to be adjusted, and there are more such opinions within the Conservative Party. Moreover, arms reduction is not limited to the current meeting, and it can also be agreed upon later, and this is also taken into consideration. Therefore, avoiding the deterioration of international relations is its strong hope, and its enthusiasm for this can be said to be stronger than Japan's. It may also accommodate Japan's demands and come forward as a mediator. There is also such a situation. Also, as France is eager to avoid the deterioration of the international situation due to the complexity of the European situation, it has always served as a mediator between our country and other countries, and it seems that it will not hesitate to work hard in the future. Comprehensively speaking, at least temporarily, it has moved away from the most serious crisis. (Allied News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>Washington - Officials here are very pessimistic about the London conference today and have regarded it as irreparable. However, it seems that the responsibility for the failure should be borne by Japan. The United States alone feels relieved. Although officials are unwilling to officially criticize the situation in London, they often hope in their private capacity that there can still be considerable stable methods for naval issues in the future. If it cannot be stabilized, it will cause suspicion, and the arms race will take the opportunity to accelerate. Accidents can cause wars. However, for the past five years, Japan has been able to do whatever it wants in Asia by relying on its existing naval power. It is very clear that the United States cannot allow Japan to increase its navy. Now the American people do not know why the Japanese army needs a larger navy. Although the Japanese army suggested a practical reduction, its demand for equality is actually an increase in comparative strength, so it is still difficult to dispel the doubts of the world. Moreover, the Philippine Islands are about to become independent, and now the economic relations between Japan and the Philippines are increasing day by day, which makes the American people deeply uneasy. Senior officials generally believe that the London conference has shown that the United States is determined to maintain the stability of naval issues, and the safety and equality of all countries are also stable methods. Judging from the situation in the past five years, it has been determined that Japan's naval strength, although different from the United States, is geographically equal to the United States in terms of safety. Now that the London conference has failed, the US government can no longer be held responsible. The government has been able to inform voters that it has done its best during the meeting. Naval experts said today that after the failure of the London conference, the naval demands for appropriations to defend the Aleutian Islands and to increase defenses in the Hawaiian Islands or the Philippine Islands will be more powerful, and the sentiment of British-American cooperation will also increase. The rumor that Britain will defend Hong Kong shows the trend of other countries after the failure of the conference. (National Telegraph, 12th)</p>
<h3 id="e27">Molotov Reports Soviet Economic Production Increased by Over 20%, All Nationalities Support Peace <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Moscow - The Soviet Union held its Second Plenary Session. Molotov delivered a speech on the development of the Soviet economy in 1935. The audience cheered thunderously. Molotov described 1935 as a "truly outstanding year" for Soviet industry, with production increasing by 20.4% compared to 1934 (the plan stipulated an increase of 16%). The heavy industry plan was completed by 107%, the timber industry by 103%, light industry by 102%, and the food industry by 111.5%. In terms of transportation, freight and railway transport increased by 23%, and waterway transport increased by 21%. Major agricultural sectors such as grain production exceeded 5.5 billion poods, cotton production increased by 45%, sugar beets increased by 43%, the number of horses increased by nearly 5%, cattle by 18%, pigs by 38%, and sheep by 25%. The Stakhanovite movement was the most important achievement of 1935. It completely revolutionized industry and transportation, and opened the first page of greatly improving socialist labor productivity. Taking the Donets coal region as an example, it is the most prominent. The Stakhanovite movement there increased coal production in December by 1.625 million tons compared to August. This number exceeded the total production in December 1925. The reason for the great success and development of the national economy lies in the "new character cadres created last year, who can truly master new technologies. They are the decisive factor in the recent huge achievements of the national economy." The reasons for these successes are, first, the great success in railway transport, which is extremely important for the development of the entire economy; second, the development of the monetary economy; and at the same time, the consolidation of the ruble due to the abolition of the rationing system; and third, the rapid improvement of the material life of the working class and collective farmers. Molotov then quoted Stalin as saying, "The basis of the Stakhanovite movement is, first, the rapid improvement of the material conditions of the workers. Life is already better, comrades, life is already more enjoyable!" (Applause). The Soviet working masses in 1935 felt even more that the development of the national economy was inextricably linked to the improvement of their material conditions. From this, we can see that the most important premise for even greater achievements in 1936 already exists.</p>
<p>Molotov stated that the 1936 national economic plan is truly a great plan. The total industrial production will increase by 23%, the machinery manufacturing industry will increase by 31%, truck production will increase by 89%, rolled steel will increase by 30%, steel will increase by 28%, and coal will increase by 24%. The production of iron will be 14.5 million tons, steel will be 16 million tons, and rolled steel will be 12.2 million tons. The development of light industry will be the greatest, with its production increasing by 29%, and the production of food and timber each increasing by 22%. The total investment is set at 32.3 billion rubles, of which 14 billion will be invested in industry, 4.7 billion in railways, and 8 billion in cultural and social institution construction and housing construction. Investment in freight and railway transport will increase by 15%. The work of industry and transportation will be accurately based on the development of the Stakhanovite movement, and at the same time, according to the resolution of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in December last year, "if industry and transportation can implement the tasks stipulated in this resolution, then this year's great plan can not only be completed, but also exceeded."</p>
<p>The Stakhanovite movement will definitely help its development, in order to mobilize all possible great forces, to catch up with and surpass the advanced capitalist countries in terms of technology. Since this movement was launched by the Stakhanovites, workers in all shops and factories have been vying to respond.</p>
<p>The plan for agriculture aims to increase production by 24%. Grain production will be 6.3 billion poods (in the past three or four years, production will be increased to 7 to 8 billion poods; this year is a major breakthrough). Sugar beet production will increase by 57%, flax by 42%, horses by 10%, cattle by 17%, and pigs by 34%. The production of agricultural machinery will reach 1 billion rubles, and the total power of tractors will increase by 30%. This plan will truly make agriculture develop unprecedentedly, because the rapid development of agriculture is timely. Collective farms will lead the rural areas of the entire country towards a happy life. The new development of the national economy must be based on the transformation of technology and the cadres of new people. These people have been able to master technology and are the core of the Stakhanovite movement. "1936 in all economic sectors will definitely be a Stakhanovite year." This year's plan will make the economy have new and great development. The national economy has been able to complete this great plan because it has become a socialist economy. There are no remnants of capitalists and petty capitalists in any sector of our country's economy. The elimination of capitalist elements makes the national income belong to the working masses and the state. The rapid improvement of the material life of our country's workers and collective farmers is based on this. The new development plan of the national economy is also a plan for the general improvement of the material life of Soviet workers, staff, and collective farmers. National income will increase by 27%, wage funds will increase by 13%, and the number of workers and staff will increase by one million. The Soviet ruble is becoming increasingly consolidated, so the increase in actual wages is greater than the increase in monetary wages. Housing construction costs are more than 2 billion rubles, an increase of 60%. The monetary income of collective farms will increase from 9.4 billion rubles in 1935 to 11.9 billion rubles in 1936. Molotov also stated that the tasks prescribed for transportation two years ago have been realized, so "the central economic task in 1936 will be the development of Soviet commerce." This development already has its best conditions, such as the large increase in the amount of goods, the sharp increase in people's income, and the consolidation of the ruble.</p>
<p>Molotov elaborated on the improvement of the cultural and technical level of the national working class, and the increase in the culture of the entire people, and said that in order to solve these most important tasks, namely, "the large-scale development of the national economy and the general improvement of material life, we can and must move forward at a Bolshevik pace." Molotov concluded the new tasks in economy and culture, pointing out the necessity of changing the People's Commissariat of Heavy Industry and Transportation into the general headquarters of industry and technology, so as to guide various enterprises and have closer contacts with various factories and workshops, and it is necessary to improve the Soviet work in urban and rural areas. Molotov said that the tasks in 1936 are very great, but our country has been able to shoulder this heavy responsibility. We have been able to fully guarantee the new development of the national economy, the general increase of material life, and continue to promote our country's culture. It is only necessary to resolutely implement the elimination of bourgeois remnants in the economy and people's consciousness, complete the technological transformation, and fully support the new people in the working class, who have won the glorious name of Stakhanovites.</p>
<p>The recent congress of industrial, transport, and industrial workers will be used as a labor mobilization for socialist builders, and to thoroughly complete the national economic plan. We must undertake this task, namely, not only to complete, but also to exceed the plan. (TASS dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>Moscow - Today, at the session of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union, after the Deputy Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union, Yan Lawk, made a report on the national economy in 1936, the Chairman of the State Planning Committee immediately proposed a discussion. At this time, the Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Ukrainian Republic, Rubekhink, Fa Zola of Uzbekistan, Kojeev of Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Armenia, the People's Commissar of Water Transport, Bakomov, leaders of various provinces and regions, members of the Central Committee, and workers and farmers spoke successively. Each speaker elaborated on the huge achievements in economy and culture of their respective republics and provinces and regions, and the tasks of completely completing the huge plan for 1936, and said that all nationalities of the Soviet Union unconditionally support the Soviet government's peace policy, and are willing to give their full strength to defend their motherland when necessary. The Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Volga-German Autonomous Republic, Wilhi, elaborated on the prosperity of the republic's economy and culture, and said that "last year, the collective farmers of the Volga-German Republic earned 5 million poods more than the previous year. The poor farmers of the past have gradually become well-off, and many people send food to unemployed workers in Germany." The Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Ukrainian Soviet Republic, Rubekhink, elaborated on the huge development of the Ukrainian economy and culture, and the huge progress of coal industry, smelting industry, and agriculture, and said that in this year, the smelting factories in the Dnipropetrovsk region alone smelted 250,000 tons of iron, more than the entire country of Japan. The Kirov factory in Makiivka produced 1.022 million tons of iron, equal to the output of Poland and Italy combined.</p>
<p>Rubekhink mentioned international issues, saying that if the enemy challenges us, then the Soviet people and their friends will clearly tell them that there is absolutely no possibility of obtaining colonies on Soviet territory. If the German fascists and Polish imperialists interfere with the Soviet Union, they will bring disaster upon themselves. No one can conquer this country under the leadership of the great leader Stanlin. Rubekhink concluded amidst thunderous applause. (TASS dispatch on the 12th)</p>

<p>Tianjin - The Liu Guitang bandits entrenched in Laiyuan were attacked by the 29th Army's Dong and Li regiments and the Jin Army's Gao regiment on the night of the 9th. The bandits were unable to resist and withdrew in a panic. Before leaving, they kidnapped over a hundred male hostages, because they failed to obtain 200 rifles, 10,000 rounds of ammunition, and 5,000 yuan from the Chamber of Commerce. They kidnapped the Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce and fled to Zoumayi in Yi County on the 10th. Because the troops were pursuing them, they split into mounted and foot bandits. Over 700 foot bandits fled to Wan and Tang counties. The mounted bandits headed to Anxin, Quyang, Yi County, Tangwan, and other places. Residents all fled. A regiment of the 53rd Army arrived in Quyang on the 11th and encountered the bandits in Qingkong Mountain, resulting in a fierce battle. The bandits were unable to resist and abandoned dozens of corpses and fled back to the Chahar border. Fuping County, fearing bandit harassment, had the garrison's 678th regiment and the police dig trenches and set up defenses in the city. Farmers in the surrounding countryside all entered the city to take refuge. Hundreds of Liu Guitang's bandits armed with complete rifles and ammunition, wearing tattered gray military uniforms, sneaked into Zhumatun outside Xifengkou on the Great Wall. They looted various villages and ordered them to prepare stoves and food, and refused to leave. The Japanese and puppet troops dispatched a team to suppress them on the 11th.

They also forced them to prepare quick stoves and food. Bandit sentries were stationed seven or eight li around the village. The people suffered heavy losses and were not allowed to flee. A certain national army, upon hearing the report, rushed to suppress them.

<h3 id="e73">The Mystery of "Death": There is No Scientific Evidence for the Immortality of the Soul <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— Special</p>
<p>Dr. Alexis Carrel, an American biologist, speculates that within the next three hundred years, rejuvenation techniques may advance to the point where science can determine that "death" is eternally a mystery. At the same time, he warned the public that artificially delaying "death" and allowing many useless people to remain in the world is more harmful than "death" itself. This is in line with the ancient Chinese saying that "an old person who does not die is a thief."</p>
<p>The doctor said at a recent discussion on "The Mystery of Death" at the New York Medical College! "If human life suddenly increases to a hundred years, then civilization will not be able to bear the economic burden of a population dominated by the elderly. Today's customs and institutions of civilization contain an order, that is, many weak, chronically ill, and stupid people in society can be cleared away with the help of "death."</p>
<p>The doctor did not believe in any of the scientific evidence that has been developed for the immortality of the soul. He said: "Hundreds of millions of people now believe in the immortality of the soul. This belief belongs to the realm of religion and philosophy, but not to the realm of experimental science. Spiritualists claim that the soul lives on after death and has been proven. However, the activity of the mind, as we know it, is an image of a living body, and after the organs disintegrate, it will never manifest itself. There is currently no scientific evidence for the theory that spirituality or part of spirituality still exists after death, but no one has the right to say that this existence is impossible."</p>
<p>The doctor then cited the potential immortality of cells. As long as Colonel Lindbergh's recently invented method is used, all the organs of a dead animal can still grow and maintain the circulation of artificial blood. The doctor himself took a heart dug out of a chicken's stomach in the Rockefeller Institute, immediately placed it in a glass tube, and used scientific methods to maintain its vitality. It has been beating vigorously for twenty-four years.</p>
<p>The doctor finally mentioned resurrection and rejuvenation, saying: "If a dead person is revived too late, then although the person is resurrected, they have no soul. Once, a woman regained life nine minutes after being legally dead, but her limbs were numb and her behavior was like an animal. The activity of the mind probably disappeared before the body died, and after death, it will never manifest itself."</p>
<p>"Spiritualists claim that the soul lives on after death and has been proven, and there is experimental evidence. We cannot deny the importance of the facts on which this speculation is based. However, their interpretation of the experimental results does not seem correct. Spiritualists forget that there is clairvoyance that can perceive things in the past and the future, so the spiritual principles that exist after death and the phenomena revealed by clairvoyance are exactly one and two, and two and one. It is impossible to distinguish between them."</p>
<p>"One of the forces that resist "death" is to seek physiological factors that can determine the limit of life. There are many centenarians in the world now, which shows that our bodies contain greater potential than we realize. In addition to heredity, certain health regimens, certain foods, or certain life-extending mental attitudes are all important conditions. The research on these conditions is still in its infancy today, but many meaningful facts have already been discovered." The doctor then cited the experience of raising mice in the Rockefeller Institute as evidence. Some foods can increase body size, and the resulting mouse pups are larger than usual and can also reduce the possibility of contracting pneumonia, but they cannot prolong life. Other foods can reduce body size, and in the first month, they can also increase the death rate, but they can indeed prolong life. This result makes people believe that the proper use of food and health regimens can prolong human life.</p>
<p>The doctor also said: "Dry cells also have latent life. Mr. Li Boxuzi once connected a semi-dry organism to a guinea pig, and it was able to revive and secrete glands again."</p>
<p>The doctor then made playful speculations about this ideal, thinking that we can put the creatures of the world in a state of suspended animation for a long time, and prolong the "death" of a limited number of individuals for a long time. He said: "Although this matter is very vague now, it is one of the four major possibilities. In the future, it may be possible to store some individuals for a long time, keeping them neither alive nor dead, and then restore them to normal life for a certain time. Maybe we can use this method to make them live for hundreds of years. Although this sounds absurd, we must know that today's utopia is tomorrow's reality."</p>
<p>"Because the time recorded by the clock passes irreversibly within the bodies of various creatures, it also records the order, so it is an incredible thing for us to conquer "death." The average life expectancy of people has now increased significantly, and the maximum limit of life may be greatly extended in the future. In the future, there may be sudden unexpected new inventions that will open up new possibilities for rejuvenation. The duel between people and "death" may not be beautiful even after victory, because artificially delaying the "death" of many people is more harmful than "death" itself. "Death" is neither a disaster nor a blessing. "Death" is not an accident from the outside, but a part of ourselves, which is inevitable and an indispensable condition for life." The doctor's remarks can eliminate many people's misconceptions about greed for life and fear of death, and break the dream of becoming an immortal.</p>

<p>Tianjin communication. Japanese military officers from inside and outside the pass gathered in Tianjin to hold a conference on the situation in North China, which has led to a sudden increase in tension in recent days. The two issues that are being used as pretexts are: First, the misunderstanding and conflict between Chinese and Japanese military police at Chaoyangmen in Beiping; Second, the Twenty-ninth Army stationed at Dagu Port, which the Japanese side accused of insulting Japanese businessmen and tearing up the Japanese flag. The Tanggu area has always been a formal military defense area. Since the conflict between the Thirty-second Army and the Zhao Lei Department of the Pseudo-Hebei Security Force, the defense area has been ceded. There are no regular troops stationed in Tanggu. Only a company from the Liu Jinshan Brigade of the 132nd Division of the Twenty-ninth Army is stationed in Dagu. On January 2, several merchants who were smuggling Japanese goods were found by the garrison troops when they were secretly entering the country. The garrison troops, together with the police chief of the local police station, pursued the smugglers. The merchants fled into the Oshimagumi and Daishimagumi, two Japanese firms in West Dagu. The military police stopped at the door and asked the firms to hand over the criminals. The Japanese in the two firms refused. Chen Yongli, a Chinese hired by the Oshimagumi, even relied on his power to insult the military police. He was arrested by his mother Chen Wu and handed over to the Public Security Bureau for punishment. On the morning of the 3rd, Oshima Kihachiro, the owner of the Oshimagumi, crossed the river and forcibly entered the military defense area, wanting to ask the garrison to release Chen Yongli and his mother. The troops refused to allow him to approach the shore and instructed him to negotiate with the police station. On the 4th, Watanabe Mihiko, a Japanese resident in Dongdazhan, was also suspected of smuggling goods and drugs. He was searched by the troops. Watanabe was dissatisfied and escaped, and then reported to Kataoka, the chief of the Tanggu Japanese Police Station Branch. Together with the military police, Bohe asked to see the garrison officer of the Twenty-ninth Army. The army said that all responsibility rested with the police station and should be handled by the police station. There was no need for the army to have direct talks, so they were not received. This also caused dissatisfaction from the Japanese side. On the 6th, people from the police station, together with troops from the Twenty-ninth Army, escorted Chen Yongli, a Chinese from the Oshimagumi who had been arrested, to the Daishimagumi to identify the criminals. After the Daishimagumi left, it suddenly tore up the Japanese flag hanging outside the door and smashed the doors and windows, etc., falsely accusing the military police of doing it. The Oshimagumi also imitated Daishimagumi's trick of planting evidence, deliberately messing up the miscellaneous items in the room and tearing down the Japanese flag. As a result, the Tianjin Japanese Army and the Japanese Consulate General clamored, believing that the Twenty-ninth Army had insulted the Japanese side. On the evening of the 6th, in addition to sending Chen Dongsheng, a member of the Hebei Provincial Government stationed in Tianjin, to negotiate with the Japanese side and promising to thoroughly investigate and handle the matter, the Pingjin Garrison Headquarters also ordered Lu Nansheng, a member of the department, to come to Tianjin and go to Dagu to investigate with Onozaki, the judicial director of the Japanese Consulate General, and Police Officer Hara. On the same day, Consul General Kawakoshi sent a letter to the Tianjin office of the Hebei Provincial Government based on the reports of the owners of the two firms, Daishimagumi and Oshimagumi, and the Twenty-ninth Army separately sent protests. The wording was still mild and could have been resolved peacefully. Chen Dongsheng went to Baoding that night to report to Song Zheyuan the process of contacting the Japanese side. However, on the morning of the 7th, Ono, the director of the investigation sent to Dagu, and Police Officer Hara returned to Tianjin and reported to Kawakoshi. At the same time, the Japanese Army adopted a persistent attitude, refusing to understand and supporting the serious protest of the consulate. Song, upon hearing the news in Baoding, urgently ordered Xiao Zhenying to negotiate. Xiao met with Commander Tada and Chief of Staff Nagami, but their attitudes were very tough and negotiations could not continue. On the afternoon of the 9th, the Japanese side re-submitted a protest in the name of Consul General Kawakoshi. In addition to listing eight facts in the original text, there were six demands attached: 1. The chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government and the commander of the Twenty-ninth Army must formally apologize to the Japanese side in writing. 2. The directly responsible persons of the Dagu Garrison Army and the Public Security Bureau Branch must be dismissed. 3. The arrested criminals must be severely punished. 4. Compensation for damages. 5. The headquarters of the Twenty-ninth Army and the Hebei Provincial Government must order their subordinates not to insult the Japanese side again in the future. 6. Guarantee that such incidents will not happen again in the future. The letter of protest was still sent to the headquarters of the Twenty-ninth Army and the Tianjin office of the Hebei Provincial Government. Currently, the Dagu garrison company commander has been automatically replaced, and the chief of the Dagu Police Station, Zhang, has fled in fear of crime. The Japanese side's responsibility for the negotiations seems to have been transferred from the consulate to the garrison army. What will be expressed in the future will depend on the decision of the Tianjin military officer conference. (11th)</p>

Zhang Renmin and Pan Yizhi of the Gui Faction Arrive in Guangdong to Await His Arrival. <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou communication. Mr. Hu Hanmin, who has been abroad for several months, was elected as a member of the Central Standing Committee and Chairman of the Central Party Headquarters by the Fifth National Congress. All parties have telegraphed him to return to the country to preside over the central party affairs. Hu left France for Italy on the 29th of last month and also intended to travel. He agreed to the requests of all parties to return to the country after receiving repeated telegrams from the country. He set off on a ship from Italy at the beginning of the month and is expected to pass through Singapore on the 15th or 16th of this month. In addition to sending Xu Chongzhi and others south to welcome him, the Southwest is also looking forward to Hu's return to the country. The Southwest Executive Department has specially sent representative Liu Luyin, and the Southwest Political Affairs Committee has sent representative Li Xiaosheng. The Guangdong Provincial Government, the Guangdong Provincial Party Headquarters, the Seventh Provincial Party Congress, and the headquarters of the First Army Group have sent representatives Lin Yizhong, He Guanghe, Huang Henong, Wu Zhimei, Wu Bosheng from the Guangzhou Municipal Government, Deng Zhende, Deng Zishi from the Overseas Party Headquarters, Luo Yixia, Li Shusheng, Jiang Jianwu, and a group of more than ten people to Hong Kong on the 7th of this month. They will take the Porthos ship to Singapore at 4:00 p.m. on the 8th and are expected to arrive in Singapore on the 12th to meet Hu. This shows that various agencies and groups in the Southwest express a warm welcome to Hu's return to the country. The Seventh Provincial Party Congress sent a letter to Hu requesting instructions. The letter was handed to Lin Yizhong to deliver in person. The letter said, "Chairman Hu Zhantang, the General Assembly (referring to the Seventh Guangdong Provincial Party Congress, which opened on the 4th, all believe that the national crisis is imminent and is on the verge of survival. How to establish the foundation for national salvation in the future and how to carry out the struggle depend on your leadership and guidance. We heard that you are returning to the country and everyone is grateful. In addition to appointing Comrade Lin Yizhong as a representative to welcome you to Singapore, we respectfully inform you in advance and respectfully ask for your inspection. The Seventh Guangdong Provincial Congress bows, (July) seal." It was also heard that Hu will arrive in Hong Kong on the 19th of the month, stay for a while, and then go to Beijing. If necessary, he may come to Guangzhou. The Municipal Party Headquarters plans to convene people from all walks of life at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall to hold a meeting to welcome him. As for the Guangxi Province, Zhang Renmin, the chief of staff of the Guangxi Army, and Pan Yizhi, the representative of the Guangxi Provincial Government, were also appointed to welcome Hu. Zhang and Pan were originally scheduled to take a plane to Guangdong and then to Hong Kong on the 7th, and then take a ship to Singapore. However, due to the bad weather, it was inconvenient to fly. They changed to a land route to Guangzhou. They departed from Nanning on the 7th, arrived in Wuzhou on the 8th, and finally arrived in Guangdong on the 10th. It is not certain whether they will go to Singapore or stay in Guangdong to wait for Hu. (January 9)</p>
<h3 id="e80">Chao-Shan: Vagrant Japanese Roaming Unrestrainedly, Openly Robbing Private Cargo Ships in Broad Daylight; South China Puppet Autonomous Government is Brewing <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Since December 1st of last year, after the Chao-Shan Anti-Smuggling Bureau unified anti-smuggling powers, various tax-collecting merchants and companies were no longer allowed to send inspectors to investigate and harass travelers and returning overseas Chinese. Since then, they have gained many conveniences. Upon landing, after the customs officers inspected their luggage, and after being inspected by the tax police of the Anti-Smuggling Bureau, they could move their luggage into hotels or take boats and cars to their hometowns in the interior. Currently, the Chao-Shan Anti-Smuggling Bureau has a battalion of armed tax police, with five anti-smuggling vessels distributed in key locations on land and water for patrol. Six inspection zones and twenty-one checkpoints have been established in various counties under Chaozhou's jurisdiction. They focus on investigating and seizing heavily taxed goods such as smuggled oil, rice, beans, various textiles, matches, and alcohol, in order to maintain the income from various taxes. Since the anti-smuggling operation began, it has achieved great results. A large amount of smuggled goods has been seized from shops and residents along the waterways and roads. At the same time, many major international negotiations have also taken place. However, the income of the agricultural and miscellaneous tax bureau has gradually improved. At the end of last month, Chinese merchants purchased 70,000 to 80,000 bags of taxable beans from Shanghai, and the lifeless Shantou North-South Trade Grain Merchants and Oil Merchants have seen a revival. The smuggled goods seized by the Anti-Smuggling Bureau used to be sent to Shantou for processing. However, after the incident of vagrant Japanese robbing cargo ships on the evening of the 17th of last month, all seizures in various counties are now handled locally. For serious cases involving political implications, they will be escorted to Guangdong for punishment on the 4th of this month.</p>
<p>At 4 PM on the 4th of this month, a smuggling rice boat with more than 100 bags of rice and beans was intercepted in the Chao-Yang sea area and towed back to the Shantou Deji Foreign Firm pier. As it was being unloaded into the warehouse, the Anti-Smuggling Bureau sent four inspectors to supervise. Towards evening, more than ten vagrant Japanese suddenly appeared, armed with knives and axes, first beating the guarding inspectors and cutting the ship's cable with axes, intending to rob and transport the cargo away. The inspectors resisted desperately and reported to the Anti-Smuggling Bureau, which sent 50 armed tax police to temporarily guard and impose martial law on the seaside, dispersing a group of armed men. Traffic on nearby roads was temporarily cut off. Finally, the rice and beans in the ship were completely unloaded into the warehouse overnight, and martial law was lifted the next morning. Some vagrant Japanese approached Xiao Sheng, the director of the Anti-Smuggling Bureau, falsely claiming that the rice and beans belonged to them and making many unreasonable demands. Xiao went to see Li Yukun, the chief of staff of the Eastern District Public Office, and reported to Mayor Li Yuanhe, saying that if the vagrant Japanese continued to act so unrestrainedly, unexpected events might occur. That night, he telegraphed the details to the province, requesting Li Han-hun to return to Shantou as soon as possible to take charge. In addition, there has recently been a brewing of a South China puppet autonomous government in Chao-Shan. A fake Plum Blossom Party organization was discovered in Songkou Township. In the past two months, an increasing number of vagrant Japanese have been sneaking into the interior from Taiwan and Xiamen. They are active in the lower levels of society, forming ×× societies, and enticing poor farmers, workers, and the unemployed. They set up hospitals and pharmacies in various fairs, secretly engaging in high-profit businesses. It is reported that the coastal terrain of Chaoyang, Dahao, Aotou, and Haimen has all been photographed. Even the key point of entering Shantou from Chaozhou at Donghu Bogong Ridge has been surveyed by the vagrant Japanese, despite the people's resistance. The Guangdong General Headquarters believes that the vagrant Japanese have ulterior motives and secretly telegraphed the Chao-Mei county magistrates and defense forces to pay attention to the comings and goings of pedestrians, and issued a notice stating that no foreign nationals are allowed to arbitrarily photograph scenery or steal terrain without a passport and permission from military and political authorities.</p>
<h3 id="e81">The Ping-Han Railway Bureau Takes Over the Dao-Qing Railway: Changed to a Branch Line, Reducing Scope for Reorganization; Clearing Foreign Debt Set to Be Completed Within Fifteen Years <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Railway Minister Zhang Jia , at the beginning of his tenure, advocated merging the Dao-Qing Railway into the Ping-Han Railway, reducing its scope, and engaging in reorganization. Later, he sent Zou Anzhong, deputy director of the Ping-Han Railway Bureau, to Jiaozuo to take over. Now it has been completed. Mr. Zou returned to Hankou from Jiaozuo today and reported the details to Beijing by telegram. The Dao-Qing Railway starts from the Luo River and ends at Daokou, with a total length of more than 170 kilometers. Because the route is too short, and the only product along the line is the coal produced by the Jiaozuo Zhongfu Company, there is a lack of large-scale products for transportation. Therefore, the annual revenue of the road is only about 1.8 to 1.9 million yuan. After deducting expenses of more than 1.6 million, there is only a surplus of about 200,000 yuan. However, the foreign debt owed to the British merchant bank group is as high as 1.6 million yuan, and the surplus is not enough to pay the interest. The future is indeed worrying. Mr. Zhang Jiawei believes that reorganizing railway administration must start with clearing foreign debt, and clearing foreign debt requires the road to reduce its organization and save expenses. Therefore, it was decided to merge the Ping-Han Railway Bureau for management. After gathering Chen Yanjiong, director of the Ping-Han Railway Administration Bureau, and Zou Anzhong, deputy director, in Beijing, a method was agreed upon and changed to the Dao-Qing branch line. At the end of last year, the Railway Department issued a clear order to Hankou and sent Zou to Jiaozuo to take over. Zou immediately ordered the five departments of the bureau to send staff to go together. They departed north from Hankou on December 31 and arrived in Jiaozuo on January 2 of this year. At that time, a small number of Dao-Qing employees intended to instigate a disturbance and resist the order. After Zou gathered them for a lecture, explaining the Ministry's intention to merge the Dao-Qing Railway, it was for the purpose of reorganizing the railway and unifying management. The employees deeply understood the righteousness and happily complied. The takeover began on the 2nd and was completed by the 8th. The Dao-Qing Railway Bureau originally had five departments: Transportation, Engineering, Mechanical, General Affairs, and Accounting, as well as a Railway Police Department. After merging into the Ping-Han Railway, the directors of the General Affairs and Accounting departments were first dismissed, and the directors of the Transportation, Engineering, and Mechanical departments, as well as the chief of the Police Department, were changed to section chiefs. The remaining staff were assessed and selectively retained. Those who were dismissed were given severance pay ranging from one to three months, and a bonus of one month, depending on their seniority. The workers and railway police remained as before, without any reductions. Although accounting was also merged, revenue and expenditure were still separated to facilitate debt settlement. It is reported that the Ping-Han Railway Bureau's plan for reorganizing the Dao-Qing branch line in the future, such as adjusting transportation, increasing and decreasing freight rates, and purchasing vehicles and cultivating roads, has been determined. Attention will be paid to the item of clearing foreign debt. Generally, after the merger, revenue can be increased by 400,000 yuan, and expenses can be reduced by 200,000 yuan, with an annual surplus of more than 800,000 yuan. It is hoped that interest on foreign debt can be waived and gradually paid off within fifteen years. When Mr. Zou took over, he was ordered by the Ministry to also serve as a representative for negotiating foreign debt. He held two resolutions with Mr. Bell, the representative of the British Zhongfu Company, in Jiaozuo as a preliminary negotiation, and the opinions have become closer. Bell will come to Hankou within days to make detailed negotiations, and Mr. Woodrow, the chairman of the company, will also come to China from England to preside over the negotiations. After a method is agreed upon in Hankou, the Ping-Han Railway Bureau will submit it to the Ministry of Railways for approval and implementation. (12th)</p>

<p>Public Warehouses for Field Rent Established Throughout the Villages</p>
<p>Due to the agricultural disaster and poor harvest this year, the rice shop owners in Suzhou have received few rental payments. The receipts of farm rent is currently less than 40 percent, even after the harvest season. Rent riots have risen up throughout the villages, and despite the county government's efforts to collect the taxes, it hasn't been effective. Now that the rent riots have ceased, and after the village district chiefs mediated, the rice shop owners have agreed to reduce the quality and amount of rent by discretion. For heavily damaged lands, rent will be waived, with only a land price tax of one yuan levied. The farmers have largely expressed their satisfaction. To accommodate the farmers, the rice shop owners have decided to work together and establish public warehouses throughout the villages to collect rents. For this matter, County Chief Wu went to the province yesterday to report the progress of the rent collection in person to the two department heads. With the end of the lunar year approaching, the provincial government needs funds urgently, so he sternly ordered all grain households to quickly go to the county and pay the land price tax.</p>

<p>Old Man Uses Clever Tricks to Deceive Pharmacy</p>
<p>Zhou Heming, the owner of Jiugao Pharmacy in Wuyi Qianqiu Lane, employed two partners. At around 8 AM on the morning of the 12th, an old man suddenly came to the store to buy medicine, claiming to be from Xuzhou and selling horses in Changzhou, buying medicine along the way. The store owner took a piece of paper with a list of medicines, including the German Lion Brand "606" and other items, and asked if the store had everything. The store owner replied that they did. The old man said that he would come back to buy it later. At around 11 AM, the old man came again, carrying three large cigarette boxes, an empty paper box, and a flour sack. He then put the medicine into the empty box and added cod liver oil, hemostatic single medicine, cotton, etc., and tied it up with a mat bag. As the store owner was opening the account to wait for him to pay and deliver the goods, the old man suddenly said that he had not brought the money and needed to go get it, so he would delay picking up the goods. After saying that, he turned and left. The store owner became suspicious and inspected the wrapped medicine box. Who knew that the medicine in the box had disappeared without a trace, leaving only ten large pieces of hemp cake? The other large cigarette boxes were also full of shredded paper and messy ropes. So, he sent his partners to search everywhere. Soon, they saw the old man at the train station, getting on the train and putting the medicine into a bag. They immediately grabbed him. The old man knew that his scam had been exposed and quickly returned the original items, cupped his hands, and apologized. The store partner then took the items and returned. This matter spread quickly, and everyone said it was like a calculating plan.</p>

<p>Zhenjiang-Yangzhou Bus Runs Over Passenger</p>
<p>The last bus, number 15, of the Zhenjiang-Yangzhou long-distance bus, which departed from Zhenjiang on the 11th, arrived at Hongqiao Station. A young man suddenly got off the bus and then got back on to retrieve the radio he had left behind. As he was getting off the bus again, a passenger sitting near the door closed the door, tightly clamping the young man's coat inside. The driver, unaware, immediately started the bus, dragging the young man down. Villagers along the way shouted for the bus to stop. By the time the door was opened, the bus had not stopped, and the young man had fallen under the bus, his head crushed by the rear wheel, and his brains spilled out, killing him instantly. The villagers were in an uproar, and many onlookers gathered. Everyone saw a blurred mass of flesh and could not recognize who it was. Finally, a young woman recognized the gold ring on the deceased's hand as the one they had exchanged when they got married. She was so distraught that she almost fainted. It was then discovered that the deceased was named Yu Jingduo, 22 years old. The young woman was the daughter of Gao Xiaofu, a timber merchant from Hongqiao Town. Yu was married into the Gao family, and his old home was in Twelve Wharf. He opened a department store in Xiaguan, Nanjing. He decided to return to his hometown from Nanjing and met with tragedy.

This not only poses a danger to the buses themselves but also has a significant impact on the embankment. On the 11th, they jointly telegraphed Chairman Chen of the Provincial Government and Director Shen of the Construction Department, appealing to survey a new route east of the Yun embankment, allocate mu donations for road construction, make slight use of civilian fields, and recruit civilian laborers. Taking advantage of this agricultural gap, they should build the Qingyang highway as soon as possible, for a long-term solution, establishing a foundation that will not fail for a hundred years. This will not only avoid the danger of harming the embankment but also seek the safety of travelers. This is a win-win situation. At the same time, they also telegraphed to the counties east of the canal, asking them to advocate the same.</p>

Yesterday morning, the sky finally cleared, and 6,000 laborers on the entire line worked hard to catch up. The road laborers, numbering more than three thousand, building the section to Fangniao, saw that the work was incompatible, and were loudly rebuked by Xu Baoyuan, the provincial engineering instructor, who also removed the marks of laborers Chen Lichang and others and presented them to the province for investigation. The crowd was furious and surrounded and beat the instructor. Fortunately, Baochang Chen Xianrong mediated. In the afternoon, instructor Xu had another conflict with the laborers and vented his anger on Baochang Chen Xianrong and Qian Boyan, removing their marks. This aroused public anger again, and they rushed to Instructor Xu, waving their fists to hit him. Chen Xianrong and Qian Boyan, fearing a major disaster, immediately protected Instructor Xu, who was able to escape. At this time, the noise shook the sky, and all the supervisors on the entire line fled. Instructor Xu fled to the county government, and more than 3,000 laborers also ran to the county government, intending to enter. Fortunately, the regiment police suppressed them, and they gathered outside the gate, shouting slogans. County Chief Yang Zhanchun happened to be attending a provincial land administration meeting and had not returned, so Secretary Shen Jiasheng, Shen Jiren, Standing Committee Member of the County Party Headquarters, Chen Zhefu, Captain of the Police Brigade, and Ma Shirong, Chief of the Public Security Section, jointly discussed a solution and met with the petition representatives. The riot has not yet subsided.</p>

The dates will be decided and announced by the factory. During the overall shutdown period, the factory will lend each worker eight wages. The wages lent before and after will be deducted by three wages per month in February, March, and April of this year. If there is a reduction in working hours in February, March, and April, one wage will be deducted from the lent wages, and two wages will be handled as usual. Both parties were satisfied and dispersed.</p>

<h3 id="e82">Public Speaking on the National Language Subject: How to Read <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— Xia Genzun, Compilation Director of Kaiming Bookstore</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I gave a speech to middle school students on the topic of "What to Read." Today's speech can be seen as a continuation of the previous one, with the topic being "How to Read." The previous speech, "What to Read," was about the types of reading materials. Today's speech, "How to Read," is about the methods of reading.</p>
<p>"How to Read," like "What to Read," is an old question, and many people have said various things about it in the past. What I am talking about today does not contain any new ideas or methods that have not been expressed by predecessors. Today's speech is for middle school students, and I only hope that my words will be suitable for middle school students.</p>
<p>When I talked about "What to Read" last time, I divided the scope of reading into three aspects. The first is books related to one's profession, the second is reference books, and the third is books for cultivating personal interests. The profession of middle school students is learning middle school courses, and middle school textbooks belong to the first category. When studying schoolwork, other books are needed for reference, which are reference books and belong to the second category. Selecting some books that suit one's personal interests or are related to self-cultivation to read outside of class is the third category. Today, when talking about "How to Read," I still want to talk about it based on these three aspects.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the first category, books related to your profession, which are textbooks. There are two types of textbooks on your desk: one with a rigorous system and one without a rigorous system. Subjects such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, geography, history, botany, zoology, etc., all have certain chapters and a certain order, which is a systematic approach. Subjects such as national language readers and English readers do not have a rigorous system. An essay by Han Yu can be included in the first volume of junior high school national language, or it can be included in the second volume of senior high school national language. A biography of Benjamin Franklin can be placed in the third volume of junior high school English or the second volume of senior high school English. If you pay attention to the textbooks you are using, you will already know this situation. This situation is not accidental and can be said to be related to the nature of the subject. Those with a rigorous system belong to the general so-called sciences, while subjects like national language and English focus on language and writing. Except for grammar books and rhetoric books, the general so-called readers and textbooks are all used as models and tools for practice, so they do not have a rigorous system themselves. Since textbooks have this distinction, the methods of reading should also be different.</p>
<p>If we separate reading into two types, general science textbooks should focus on reading, while language and literature textbooks should focus on reciting. General science textbooks are also written in language, but our learning goal is not the language itself. For example, when we learn geography or chemistry, what we should pay attention to is the subject matter recorded in the geography and chemistry books. These items are originally recorded in language, except for diagrams and charts, but we do not need to memorize and ponder them specifically through language. We only need to obtain the content from the language. As for language subjects, it is different. When we read an article in the national language textbook—let's say it is a record by Han Yu—at this time, we should not only know who Han Yu is and understand the content of this record, but we should also have other goals, such as the structure of the article, the style of the sentences, the methods of description and expression, etc., all of which must be studied. If you read Han Yu's record and only know that there was such a painting at the time and that Han Yu wrote such an article, then it is equivalent to not having studied this article as a national language lesson. When we read the story of Washington cutting down the cherry tree in the English textbook, the purpose is not to know why Washington cut down the cherry tree and what happened later, but to use this story as material for learning English and to acquire various rules of English. Therefore, the two words "reading" can be used separately. General science textbooks should understand their content and should not waste effort on language. Just read them well. Subjects such as national language and English are language subjects and should focus more on form. Just reading is not enough; you should study them well.</p>
<p>Whether it is reading or reciting, you should not relax when it comes to textbooks, because this is formal schoolwork and your professional work. If you have any doubts, you should look up the dictionary. If you have any questions, you should look up the books. This is the so-called reference book. Reference books are prepared for diligent people, because in order to refer to something, you must first have items or questions to refer to. These items or questions will only arise from people who read carefully in all aspects. I have already talked about this reason in the previous speech. Those who have heard it should still be able to remember it. I won't say much more. Now let me talk about some things that should be paid attention to when reading reference books.</p>
<p>First, I advise you to temporarily determine the scope of reference and not abandon the items or questions you want to refer to. When we look up a dictionary, we are generally satisfied when we find the word or allusion we want to look up and will not be distracted by the dictionary. However, if it is a reference book other than a dictionary, one may often stray far away if one is not careful. For example, you read "Peach Blossom Spring" and go to read a message about Thomas More's Utopia as a reference book for the item "Utopian thought," which is correct, but you must temporarily remember that what you want to refer to is "Utopian thought," not other items. Don't let your mind wander to very distant places because you read a message about Thomas More's Utopia. Thomas More advocated art and was a social thinker. If you are not careful, you may forget what you read about "Peach Blossom Spring" and circle around ideas such as social thought and art, turning from aspect A to aspect B, and then turning from aspect B to aspect C, resulting in a chaotic mind. When we talk to friends, we often stray far from the topic and forget what we were just talking about. This is very similar to abandoning the original topic because of reading reference books. People who understand the art of speaking will often remind their opponents in this situation to bring the conversation back to the matter at hand. You should pay the same attention when reading reference books and should not be distracted by aspects that are not directly related to the topic you want to refer to.</p>
<p>Second, I advise you to take advantage of the convenience of reference to pay attention to the general nature and content of general books. Apart from checking dictionaries and flipping through magazines, so-called reference books are usually independent books. Each book has its own nature, content, and organizational style. Since you have the opportunity to see a certain book for reference, it is not difficult to learn something about the book. In middle school, you have various tasks to do, and there is very little time for extracurricular reading. However, some books are indispensable for knowledge and future application. For example, we do not read the "Twenty-Four Histories" and the "Thirteen Classics" in middle school, but we should know what the "Twenty-Four Histories" and the "Thirteen Classics" are. We are not Christians and do not need to read the Bible, but we should know the general content of the New and Old Testaments. If you are reading a history lesson and want to know more details about the topic of "Emperor Wu of Han expanding the territory," you can flip through the "Records of the Grand Historian" or the "Book of Han." At this time, you will probably flip through the table of contents first. When you flip through the table of contents, you will definitely see titles such as "Annals," "Hereditary Houses," "Biographies," "Tables," and "Treatises." This is the organizational structure of the "Records of the Grand Historian" or the "Book of Han." After reading one chapter of the "Annals of Emperor Wu," or several sections of the entire chapter, and then looking at these table of contents, you will have a relationship with the "Records of the Grand Historian" or the "Book of Han." You can understand what kind of books the "Records of the Grand Historian" and the "Book of Han" are in general. To give another example, you hear the words "Theory of Evolution" from a teacher of botany or zoology. If you want to know more details about this topic, you can go to the library to find a book to read. Suppose you find a "Outline of the Theory of Evolution" by Chen Jianshan, you can first read the preface to see what aspects this book talks about, and then check the table of contents to see what items are inside. What you want to refer to now may only be one section or one chapter of it, but the comprehensive knowledge of this whole book is very useful to you. If you pay attention at any time, you can acquire the comprehensive and general knowledge of many books in a year. Over time, you will know what is in those books. To check those items, you should find which police and flipping through will be very convenient. (To be continued)</p>

<p>The Beijing Palace Museum, considering that the antiquities transported south by the museum have not been stored in a suitably safe address, in order to protect the antiquities, specially obtained the approval of the Ministry of Education to allocate the Chaotian Palace address in the capital to rebuild the branch and storage vault and approved an appropriation of 200,000 yuan for the 24th year, which was organized by the museum's Construction Engineering Committee to preside over everything and requested Jietai engineers to design and prototype. Since construction began in October last year, the project has been proceeding smoothly. The branch and storage vault can be completed by the end of next month. After the interior decoration is completed, all antiquities transported south will be stored in them, and the Beijing and Shanghai offices will be closed to establish a branch. Part of the antiquities deposited by the museum in the warehouse on Tianzhutang Street in the French Concession of this port has now begun to be verified and prepared for shipment. Ouyang Banghua, director of the office, has been personally checking and registering every day, which has been very busy. All verification matters can be completed within this month. According to relevant sources, after the capital storage vault is completed, another batch of antiquities from Beijing will be transported south.</p>
<h3 id="e86">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Again Telegraphed to Request the Cancellation of the Surtax on Domestic Bran <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Southwest Political Affairs Committee, the Guangdong Provincial Government, the Commissioner of Finance's Office, and President Zou of Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou again yesterday to request the cessation of the surtax on domestic bran. The two telegrams are recorded below:</p>
<p>Telegram to the Southwest Political Affairs Committee, etc.: To the Southwest Political Affairs Committee in Guangzhou, the Guangdong Provincial Government, and the Commissioner of Finance's Office: The surtax on domestic bran has been repeatedly petitioned by manufacturers in Jiangsu and Shanghai due to difficulties. Subsequently, a petition was made to the First Plenary Session of the Central Committee, which approved the resumption of work first and passed the case of Sun Yat-sen University raising construction funds. It seems that the cancellation of this surtax is no longer difficult. President Zou also told the petitioning manufacturers that he would return to Guangdong to discuss a solution, which was greatly appreciated. More than 40 days have passed, but no clear order for cancellation has been received. The end of the year is approaching, and inventories are piling up, making it unbearable to bear the heavy burden. We sincerely request that you separately grant a clear order to exempt Northeast products and products from other provinces from the surtax. Sincerely, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Telegram to Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou: To President Zou of Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou: When the surtax on bran was in Shanghai, the difficulties were presented to you by the industry, and you graciously agreed to mediate when you returned to Guangdong, which was greatly appreciated. We immediately resumed work as instructed. More than 40 days have passed, but no good news has been received. The end of the year is approaching, and there are mountains of goods in stock. We humbly ask for your swift rescue to exempt the surtax. We also hope for a telegraphic reply. Sincerely, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3 id="e87">The Ningjing Stranded on Chenjia Island; 5 Miles from Jiujiang; Telegraph Old Ning Shao to Tow for Rescue <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>In recent months, there has been very little cargo shipped downstream on the Yangtze River. Recently, as the end of the lunar year approaches, business groups must ship goods to Shanghai as soon as possible for economic settlement. Therefore, the Ningjing Wheel of the Ning Shao Company, returning from Hankou to Shanghai, was fully loaded with more than 20,000 pieces of tobacco, cotton, grain, and other goods, making it one of the largest shipments downstream carried by the ship. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today to unload at the warehouse. Unexpectedly, since the beginning of this month, the water level of the Yangtze River has been sharply receding. Around the 10th, the drop was even greater, falling more than two feet a day. On the 12th of this month, the highest water mark in Jiujiang was no more than 16 feet. In Wuhu, the lowest point was 13 feet. The Ningjing Wheel has a load capacity of 1,693 tons and is a new ship of the Ning Shao Company. The hull is 250 feet 6 inches long, 37 feet 4 inches wide, and 19 feet 6 inches deep. The draft of the empty ship is 16 feet 7 inches, and it is more than 17 feet after loading. At 8:00 PM on the 12th, when the ship arrived at Chenjia Island, 5 miles downstream from Jiujiang, it suddenly ran aground. At that time, because the hull was stuck in shallow sand and the water receded with a heavy load, the captain repeatedly reversed the engine but could not get out of the shallows. He had to telegraph Shanghai for help and instructions. Yesterday morning, after discussions at the Shanghai company, they immediately telegraphed the Jiujiang branch to quickly send barges to Chenjia Island to unload the cargo from the Ningjing's cabins. If the Ningjing could be rescued immediately, the cargo would be loaded back into the ship and carried to Shanghai. Barging has been underway since yesterday afternoon. When reporters inquired at the company, a Mr. Chen in charge said that the reason for the Ningjing's grounding had not yet been reported by the captain, but it was mostly due to shallow water. Now that the cargo has been barged, it is hoped that the weight of the ship will be reduced, and it may float to the surface of the river. Today, the Old Ning Shao ship is passing through Chenjia Island, and the company has telegraphed the ship, ordering it to go and tow for rescue.</p>
<h3 id="e88">The Joint Association Asks the Entertainment Industry to Promote the Rent Reduction Movement <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The Joint Association of Rent Reduction in Various Districts of Shanghai, in order to promote universal rent reduction, sent a letter to the local opera, new drama, Suzhou ballad, and storytelling circles in this city yesterday. The original text reads: Sirs, our association was established in response to the needs of the times and the appeals of the citizens, and it is the Joint Association of Rent Reduction in Various Districts of Shanghai. Working tirelessly day and night, we have relied on the support of the masses and the approval of leaders from all walks of life. Under the leadership of the party and government, since its establishment, the association's affairs have progressed by leaps and bounds. The landlords who understand righteousness and reduce rent have become a trend in both the Chinese and foreign concessions, showing that righteousness is in the hearts of the people. The relief of the city's depression and the restoration of commercial prosperity may depend on this. Our association still does not dare to be complacent. We deeply know that this movement must first awaken the citizens of the whole port to work together before it can be completed. To awaken the citizens of the whole port, we must expand the publicity work so that it can be universally and deeply rooted. We have always known that you are a man of insight, with the eloquence of Man Qian and the appearance of Yu Meng, humorously satirizing like Jing Ting, and inspiringly surpassing Guinian. In laughter, anger, and scolding, you have the effect of changing customs. Using national ideas as a morning bell and evening drum, such as dramas on resisting Japan and saving the country, from the wise and discerning to the villagers, all are moved to action. To this day, the patriotic sentiment in the city has been aroused and is rising, permeating the whole port and becoming unstoppable. All this is thanks to your efforts. Your great achievements are well-known. Therefore, we are not afraid to be ignorant and propose that you incorporate and describe the rent reduction situation in each performance, combining solemnity and humor, and combining reward and punishment, in order to awaken the citizens of the whole port to celebrate the righteous cause together. Over time, the effect will be considerable. If you agree, we will be extremely grateful. Seeing that the association's affairs will have new developments and rent reduction will be successful, it is also thanks to your efforts. It is not only a blessing for our association but also a blessing for the entire city. The matter concerns the citizens' livelihoods and will definitely be supported.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Yesterday Morning, Director Ye Zhuotang of the Central Trust Bureau Assumed his Concurrent Post; Chairman Kong Xiangxi Encouraged his Colleagues to Work Hard; Former Director Zhang Handed Over and Immediately Went to Hangzhou and then to Jiangxi <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Gongquan, Managing Director and Director of the Central Trust Bureau, resigned from his concurrent position as director due to his appointment as Minister of Railways. Ye Zhuotang, Managing Director, took over as acting director and took office yesterday morning. The Chairman delivered a speech encouraging his colleagues to work hard. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Guests Offering Congratulations: Ye Zhuotang went to the Central Trust Bureau at 10:00 AM yesterday morning to take over as acting director. The guests who came to offer congratulations included Kong Xiangxi, Minister of Finance and Chairman of the Central Trust Bureau, Zou Lin and Xu Kan, Directors of the Ministry of Finance, Dai Mingli, Director of the Currency Department, Chen Xing, President of the Central Bank. Xi Demao, Director of the Business Bureau, Li Tisheng, Deputy Director of the Treasury Bureau, and Chen Guangfu, Song Ziliang, Chuan Zongyao, Xu Xinliu, Rong Zongjing, Li Fusun, Zhu Sensheng, Chen Qilu, Chen Duan, Liu Tianke, Liu Zhujun, and other 6 people.</p>
<p>Zhang's Report: At about 10:00 AM, a meeting of all staff of the bureau was convened in the auditorium on the second floor of the bureau. First, former Director Zhang Gongquan reported that today is the day that Managing Director Ye Zhuotang takes over as acting director and that he was convening all staff to report three points: introduce the new Director Ye, ask Chairman Kong Xiangxi to give a speech, although he has resigned from the position of director, he is still a Managing Director and will still be responsible for the bureau's affairs.</p>
<p>Kong's Speech: Chairman Kong Xiangxi delivered a speech saying that today is the day that Managing Director Zhang hands over his position as director to Managing Director Ye. The Trust Bureau was originally prepared and established by Director Ye. Now, because the central government attaches great importance to the railway industry, Jiang Yuanwei wants Director Zhang to handle the affairs of the Ministry of Railways and has no time to concurrently lead the bureau, so Director Ye was asked to take over as acting director. Ye is a well-known figure in industry and commerce. Since taking over, I have great hopes for the future of the Trust Bureau. In addition, Zhang is still the Vice President of the Central Bank and the Managing Director of this bureau, so he will definitely continue to guide and help. On the stage of the bureau's auditorium, there are two words "Effort" written by the late Dean Tan. I hope everyone will follow these two words and double their efforts. In this time of national crisis, everyone should work hard. Everything comes from strength. Promoting everything can be effective. Just like the motor of a power plant, it is difficult to be the original power and should be promoted to be effective. Electricity is something that cannot be seen. I hope that all colleagues are engines, the seen is the body, and the unseen is the will, so that the Trust Bureau can be sound and benefit the people. Confucius said, "At thirty, I stood firm", "Establish oneself, then establish others", "Achieve oneself, then achieve others." Moreover, the Ministry of Railways will entrust the Trust Bureau to handle many matters. Don't disappoint Minister Zhang's expectations.</p>
<p>Ye's Reply: Ye Zhuotang replied that he was originally the Managing Director of the Trust Bureau. Since Director Zhang was honored to be appointed Minister of Railways, he was asked to take over as director. Although he felt the importance of the Trust Bureau's business, he dared not refuse. Chairman Kong and Managing Director Zhang have already given speeches. I hope that all colleagues will do their best and make more efforts according to the existing policies and steps. The meeting ended at 10:30. Also, former Director Zhang Gongquan handled the handover of the Central Trust Bureau yesterday morning, and Acting Director Ye Zhuotang took over. It was completed at about 11:00. It is reported that Zhang went to Hangzhou and then to Jiangxi last night to attend the opening ceremony of the Hunan-Jiangxi section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway.</p>

<p>Hu Hanmin, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, is currently on his way back to China and is expected to arrive in Shanghai and transfer to Nanjing before the 10th of next month to preside over central party affairs. In Shanghai, in addition to the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, Municipal Government, and other organizations initiating preparations for a grand welcome, the All-China Federation of Commerce and the General Confederation of Chinese Industries have also expressed their sincere welcome.

The administrative policy is also the same as when the previous director was in office.</p>

<h3 id="e97">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Cables Hubei Provincial Government Requesting Reduction of National Silk Business Tax <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday cabled the Hubei Provincial Government in Wuchang, which read: To the Hubei Provincial Government in Wuchang, we have received a letter from the Silk Industry Association on the 11th of this month stating that based on a letter from Supervisor Wang Yansong, the Hankou Huahua Company branch had forwarded a letter from the Hankou Silk Industry Association stating that the Hubei Finance Department intends to separately levy taxes on stores that also operate in silk, cloth, and wool based on the tax rates for the three industries starting in March of the 25th year, and to classify wool-like fabrics and rayon textiles as foreign goods and increase tax rates, etc. If implemented, this would have a significant impact on the future of the silk industry. Please find a way to maintain the current situation, etc. Now we are forwarding the situation and request that you strive to uphold the principles of the matter (omitted). The Business Tax Law, as resolved by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated by the National Government, stipulates in its fourth provision that taxes should be levied at a rate of 2 to 10 per thousand of the total business income, and that the minimum rate for business income as a business tax rate is 2 per thousand of the total income. Furthermore, the Executive Yuan's circular to all provincial and municipal governments in the 19th year of the Republic stated that the Ministry of Industry reported that silk, in our country, is nothing less than a special national product and needs protection. It is proposed that the Executive Yuan instruct all provinces that the business tax on silk should be in accordance with daily necessities, and the tax rate should not exceed 2 per thousand in order to maintain it. In addition to instructing the Ministry of Industry to present the matter, it is stated that silk is a special national product and needs protection, and its use is also for the daily necessities of the common people. Please instruct all provinces to collect business tax, and the tax rate should not exceed 2 per thousand in order to maintain it. It should be approved and handled accordingly. Please order the Ministry of Finance and all provincial and municipal governments to comply and handle it accordingly. This order, etc., is printed, distributed, and ordered to be complied with. Therefore, the silk business tax should be levied at the lowest tax rate of 2 per thousand, which is a general case approved by the Executive Yuan. All provinces should be consistent. As for the mixing of rayon in silk, its main purpose is to resist imported goods. The Ministry of Industry revised the provisional standards for domestic goods in June of the 23rd year of the Republic, dividing them into seven grades. Those with Chinese capital, Chinese management, Chinese labor, mostly using domestic raw materials, and a small part using foreign raw materials are considered second-grade domestic goods. Those mostly using foreign raw materials are considered fourth-grade domestic goods. If the use of rayon is taxed as foreign goods, then the mixing of foreign cotton in cotton yarn and the mixing of foreign wheat in flour can all be referred to as foreign goods. This violates the standards set by the Ministry and is not in accordance with the fairness of the matter. Based on the above reasons, we hereby submit this telegram to your government for review. Please uphold the current tax rate, as it is in the public interest. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce respectfully.</p>

<p>With the total closing period for the 24th year of the Republic approaching, money shops have begun closing accounts, and remittances between the silver and money industries are gradually increasing. The Industrial and Commercial Loan Review Committee held a regular meeting yesterday and continued to approve more than 100,000 yuan in credit loans. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Money Shops Closing Accounts and Remitting Funds Gradually: After the Money Shop Association decided that January 23rd would be the total closing date for the 24th year, each money shop has begun closing accounts with its customers, setting tomorrow as the date to issue a list of notifications to each account and setting the 20th as the date to issue another list. Internal office hours have been extended, and the time for external receipt and return of tickets has also been extended starting from the 19th. Remittances between the silver and money industries are gradually increasing. The interbank lending rate in the money market yesterday morning was still 8%, but the total exchange volume of the bank clearing house was 18,046,933.26 yuan, including 2,636,178.04 yuan collected on behalf of money shops.</p>
<p>Loan Committee Approved Loans: The Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Loan Review Committee held its 20th meeting yesterday. Committee members Cai Zengji, Qin Runqing, Song Ziliang, Yu Zuoting (representing Qin Runqing), Chen Guangfu (representing Cai Zengji), Bei Songsun, and Xi Demao (representing Bei) attended. Chairman Cai Zengji reported on routine committee affairs and then presented 98 applications for industrial and commercial credit loans. After review, it was decided to approve 12 households, approve loans for 15 households at half the requested amount, and approve loans for 63 households with a reduced amount, totaling 100,710 yuan in approved loans. Another 8 households were either not in line with the loan principles or lacked the necessary documents, and the committee rejected their loan applications. In addition, the second batch of joint applications for small loans of 100 yuan or less from 66 member stores of the Shanghai Noodle Association was submitted to the committee for review yesterday. As a result, 61 households were approved for loans, totaling 4,710 yuan. The association will still collect and receive the loans in accordance with the previous procedures and request that the Loan Committee send staff to supervise the distribution of loans to each household. It is heard that the Loan Committee is still continuing to accept applications for small industrial and commercial credit loans, and the number of people going to the committee's office (2nd floor of the China National Products Bank on Tianjin Road) to apply for loans has been increasing daily recently due to the approaching year-end closing period.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government has successfully pledged disaster relief bonds allocated by the central government with a face value of 3.5 million yuan and provincial water conservancy construction bonds with a face value of 3 million yuan, totaling 6.5 million yuan, to five banks in Shanghai: Central, China, Communications, Jiangsu, and Jiangsu Farmers, for a loan of 4.4 million yuan in legal tender. The contract was signed last month, and the five banks remitted the full amount of the loan yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Contract Signed and Funds Paid Yesterday: The matter of pledging Jiangsu provincial bonds to five banks began in late autumn last year. Zhao Dihua, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Finance Department, negotiated with the Communications Bank, which represented the five banks, several times. As a result, the contract was signed at the end of June, and the funds were paid yesterday. The five banks paid a total of 4.4 million yuan, with the Central, China, and Communications Banks each paying 1.1 million yuan and the Jiangsu and Jiangsu Farmers Banks each paying 550,000 yuan, totaling 4.4 million yuan, which was remitted in one lump sum.</p>
<p>Used for Huai River Diversion, Repayment in Two Years: This bond is intended to be used for the diversion of the Huai River in Jiangsu Province. Repayment is set to begin in two years, with interest at 8% per month, and interest will be paid twice a year in April and October. The five banks will jointly form a banking syndicate to handle this matter. Zhao Dihua came to Shanghai a few days ago, and because the matter has been completely successful, he has returned to Zhenjiang.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Li Pingheng Discusses the Shanghai Special Zone Labor Inspection Without Mentioning the National Labor Association; Cheng Haifeng Mediating in the Process <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Li Pingheng, the current member of the National Labor Council, told a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency during his trip yesterday that the report that the issue of factory inspection in the Shanghai Special Zone will be brought up again for discussion at the National Labor Conference this year is not true. Moreover, the government does not need to submit this issue to the National Labor Association again. After this matter was raised at the National Labor Conference last year, a meeting was convened with representatives from relevant countries such as Britain, the United States, France, Italy, and Japan. After the meeting, the representatives of the relevant countries also sent reports back to their countries. As a result, most countries adopted a wait-and-see attitude, which led to the failure to implement it. As for this matter, our government will not hesitate to suspend it for a long time. The Central Labor Inspection Office and the Shanghai Municipal Government are still negotiating, and Cheng Haifeng, Director of the China Branch of the National Labor Association, is mediating in the process and is very effective. Therefore, the solution will be to adopt a compromise method. As for the progress and content of the current process in general, it is not yet time to release it to the public. According to Li, the National Labor Conference is scheduled to be held in June, and the National Labor Maritime Conference is scheduled to be held in November. He has decided to leave Shanghai on the 19th on the Russian ship Northern Star to Vladivostok, and then transfer to the Siberian Railway to return to Geneva to perform his duties.</p>

<p>Liu Hongsheng, General Manager of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, went to Nanjing last week to visit the authorities of the Ministry of Transportation and has already completed his mission and returned to Shanghai. According to sources close to the reporter, Liu's attitude is no longer as passive as before after the Ministry of Transportation personally persuaded him to stay and promised to solve the company's difficulties to a considerable extent. However, he has not yet returned to work. The rumors that the company's board of directors will be abolished and that two deputy general managers will be added are likely to become a reality. The Ministry of Transportation is currently considering it, and the candidates have also been decided internally. Once a formal decision is made, it will be officially announced.</p>

<p>The member shops of the Shanghai Money Shop Association found that the types of tickets used by the industry were outdated and did not comply with the provisions of the Ticket Law. In order to ensure legitimate use, they specially revised three new styles of tickets: banknotes (i.e., shop notes), checks, and drafts. After being approved by the general meeting, they were officially implemented on the 1st of this month. Yesterday, a reporter from the Industrial and Commercial News Agency learned from the money industry that the three new types of tickets were marked with their respective natures and have been used smoothly since their implementation. Unnecessary disputes have been completely eliminated. The old tickets that had been printed by each shop can still be used as usual after being stamped with a seal indicating the nature of each ticket until they are used up, in order to show accommodation and save costs.</p>

<p>The fourth session of the new executive and supervisory committee members of the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association held their inauguration ceremony at the association's headquarters in the Central Trust Building on the 8th of this month. Du Yuesheng, Chairman of the association, hosted a banquet at the Hangzhou Restaurant on Avenue Edward VII at 7:00 PM last night, inviting the newly appointed Chinese directors and committee members Qian Xinzhi, Lu Bohong, Zhang Fayao, and all the executive and supervisory committee members of the association to celebrate. More than 30 people attended, including Qian Xinzhi and Lu Bohong, Zhang Xiaolin, etc., which was quite a grand occasion. First, Chairman Du Yuesheng delivered a speech saying, "Gentlemen, we are meeting today, on the one hand, to welcome Mr. Qian and Mr. Zhang, and on the other hand, to thank all the gentlemen who are already in the association. Mr. Qian Xinzhi is the new Chinese director, and Mr. Zhang Fayao is the new Chinese committee member. All of you are the backbone of society and are indeed enthusiastic about public welfare. The organization of our association is different from other public groups. It is an organization that has a very close relationship with the French Concession authorities. It is an agency that represents the obligations and rights of the Chinese people in the French Concession, and it is also an agency that represents the Chinese people to advocate fairness. With the efforts of the Chinese directors and committee members in the past, our association has already achieved great results. Today, we have added Mr. Qian Xinzhi, a prestigious figure, as a Chinese director, and Mr. Zhang Fayao, a knowledgeable man, as a Chinese committee member. I believe that we will achieve even greater results in the future. I will follow in your footsteps and work even harder." In response, Chinese Director Qian Xinzhi said, "It is an honor and a great apprehension for me to be supported by the citizens of the French Concession. Because I run a bank, I have little research on municipal administration and diplomacy. The government once appointed me as Minister to France, but I did not dare to try it. The Public Concession also once nominated me as a Chinese director, but I was fortunate enough to decline. Now, I have accepted the invitation of Chairman Du Yuesheng and the sincere persuasion of all of you present, and as a citizen of the French Concession, I resolutely accepted the position. Fortunately, there are very experienced gentlemen such as Mr. Lu Bohong and Mr. Zhang Xiaolin in front of me, so I might as well come as a trainee and follow in your footsteps and do my best to serve the society. The French Concession occupies a very important position in Shanghai. According to the recent population statistics for November, it is close to 500,000, while the Public Concession area is more than twice the size of the French Concession, and the population is only 1 million. It can be seen that the French Concession is much more densely populated than the Public Concession. The importance of our responsibility can also be seen. Finally, I thank Chairman Du." After he finished, Chinese Committee Member Zhang Fayao replied, "Mr. Qian Xinzhi is my teacher and still wants to come as a trainee, which makes me even more apprehensive. I hope that the seniors will guide me in the future, and I am willing to do my best to do something beneficial to the citizens of the French Concession, so as to increase some experience," etc. The banquet ended at 9:00 PM with everyone enjoying themselves.</p>

<p>Since the opening of the Shanghai-Suzhou Road (direct access to Suzhou) last year, travel has been quite convenient. However, since the beginning of winter, rain and snow have alternated, and it has been raining for months, and due to the frequent and heavy traffic, the road surface west of Nanxiang has been damaged by rainwater, the roadbed is loose and floating, and puddles have formed. Vehicles traveling on it are not only prone to bumps but also to getting stuck. The authorities, in view of this, have added workers and are stepping up repairs. It is expected that all repairs will be completed in half a month. It is heard that traffic will be temporarily suspended during this repair period.</p>

It has now been learned that it was decided that colleagues at the Academia Sinica will hold memorial services simultaneously in Nanjing and Shanghai at 2:00 PM on the 18th of this month.

In addition to the colleagues of the Academia Sinica in Shanghai, only the councilors of the Academia Sinica and the corresponding researchers of the various institutes will be notified in advance.

Once everything is in order, the burial will be scheduled. The rumor that Tang was from Hunan and that his remains would be transported to Hunan for burial is not accurate.</p>

The Chairman's report briefly stated that the fundraising work of each mobilization team was scheduled to conclude in phases according to previous circulars. Some team leaders have already submitted the mobilized membership fees and donations to this office. The remaining teams, either due to school holidays or being actively engaged, found it difficult to conclude on schedule. Therefore, an extension was granted until the end of January, hoping that the field secretaries would earnestly work hard to assist in the promotion and handle matters separately within the shortest possible time. In order to expand the publicity of the aviation salvation movement, this office has decided to convene representatives from various entertainment venues in the city at 4 p.m. today to discuss the issue of publicizing aviation salvation and soliciting aviation salvation funds. The collection of aviation salvation funds from the boiled water industry has been approved by the trade association and is currently under investigation and statistics, which will begin soon. Since the automotive transportation industry association requested a reduction in the collection of aviation salvation funds to two yuan per vehicle per month, starting this month, various automobile companies have been enthusiastically paying donations directly to this office or to the association. The collection of aviation salvation funds from other industries is proceeding smoothly, and the results are also excellent. The simple mobile aviation salvation exhibition has already closed in the western district of Shanghai yesterday. In order to popularize public air defense knowledge, it is scheduled to continue in the northern district of Shanghai on the 20th, at Anhui Middle School on Zhongxing Road in Zhabei.

<p>The Municipal Government yesterday sent a letter to the Flood Relief Association for Various Provinces, stating: "A case was submitted by the Mayor, along with a letter from Cai Chang, General Manager of the Shanghai Daxin Company, stating, 'Respected Sir, the tenth day of this month is the anniversary of the opening of our company. Originally, we intended to prepare a simple tea party to thank our relatives and friends for their patronage and guidance. However, considering the many difficulties facing the country and the frequent occurrences of famine and disaster, we will use the funds saved from this tea party for charitable purposes.  The Board of Directors has decided to donate 3,000 national currency, requesting your office to allocate 1,500 yuan to the Shanghai Fundraising Association for Flood Relief in Various Provinces, and the remaining 1,500 yuan to the vagrant vocational training center and the Zhabei porridge distribution center.  We are aware that this is a drop in the bucket and will not solve the problem, but this small gesture should be welcomed by your office, and our company will also use it to bring blessings to our relatives and friends, etc.' By order, the transfer should be made, etc. In response, we have enclosed 1,500 legal tender and sent it to your association, requesting verification and receipt for our records.</p>
<h3 id="e113">The Tobacco Exchange Industry Will Hold an Extraordinary Meeting Today - Discussing the Ban on Hand-Rolled Cigarettes and Other Important Matters <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Southern District Office of the Tobacco Exchange Industry Association has repeatedly received reports from members that the widespread sale of hand-rolled cigarettes throughout the city is hindering business and having a significant impact. Although a letter has been sent to the higher authorities requesting a ban and prevention, no practical measures have been taken to date, despite several months passing. The Luxin Company is selling "Little Flying Girl" cigarettes to the industry, and after being fined for counterfeit stamps, a letter was sent to the company requesting compensation for losses. However, there has been no response for a long time, which is disrespectful to the industry and the association.  Xinshunji, a member company, due to the New Year's Day holiday, rested and stopped supplying cigarettes, resulting in a shortage in the market. They borrowed five packs of "Beautiful" cigarettes from Dachangcheng in the French Concession, which were seized at the Iron Gate of the Sixteenth Shop. A letter was sent to the Huacheng Cigarette Company requesting a letter of proof to the tax office, but the result was ineffective and a fine of two yuan was imposed. It is investigated that the aforementioned cigarettes had already paid unified tax, so why were they seized and fined again? A request should be made to negotiate reasonably. Due to the economic downturn, competition among the industry, and chaotic selling prices, those who intentionally disrupt industry regulations should be severely punished and reported to the executive office of the higher authorities for punishment. Based on this, the office has specially scheduled an emergency meeting of all executive committee members to be held at the association's premises at No. 427 Fumin Road at 2 p.m. today to discuss countermeasures.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Post Offices in Various Places Will Issue Social Savings Gift Certificates <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications promulgated the rules for social telegrams, social interactions have become extremely convenient. In order to develop the telegraph business, a type of social postal savings gift certificate will be issued. This type of gift certificate will be sold by the National Postal Administration Savings and Remittance Bureau and first-class post offices throughout the country. Senders of social telegrams may attach gift certificates to the recipients, and the remittance fee for the gift certificates will be waived. The face value of these gift certificates ranges from two yuan to twenty yuan, and the certificates are divided into red and plain two types, which the sender can freely specify. Holders of social gift certificates can exchange them for legal currency at the local post office or postal machinery office at full value. The Shen Shi News Agency reporter learned from the bureau that before the issuance of social savings gift certificates, the rules for social telegrams will also be modified to suit the circumstances of the issuance of gift certificates. It is said that this measure will be implemented in March.</p>

<p>The weather in the city has been unstable with alternating periods of cold and warm for several days. Although it has rained occasionally, it still feels dry, causing many citizens to suffer from sore throats. At the same time, pests are rampant in the fields in the suburbs, which will affect this year's agricultural activities. Therefore, farmers in general are praying for auspicious snow to avoid disasters. Until about 4 p.m. yesterday, the weather suddenly changed dramatically, with the cold wind piercing to the bone and the overcast sky densely covered. Shortly after, there was light rain. After about half an hour, it turned into snow pellets, but it stopped soon. Then, snowflakes began to fly, dancing wildly in the sky. However, because the rain had not subsided, it melted as it fell. After about twenty minutes, the snow stopped, but the rain did not stop. At about 8:30 p.m., it snowed again, and it was denser than during the day, about two points high, but it still melted. It became sparse at about 10 p.m. and then stopped. However, the weather and wind direction have changed completely. We may hope for a heavy snowfall during the day.</p>

<p>In the case of the conflict between rickshaw pullers and the Mutual Aid Association in the First Special District, the First Special District Court reopened the trial at 10:45 a.m. yesterday. Judge Jiang Shuzi presided over the third criminal court to question the defendants. All 23 rickshaw pullers, including Lu Deguang, appeared in court as summoned and continued to retain attorneys Xi Yafu and Zhu Shuzhen to defend them. Zhang Dengying appeared in court on behalf of the Mutual Aid Association. First, the detective attorney presented the case, and then Judge Jiang interrogated them separately. As a result, Cang Gongsen, Ji Defang, Li Youfu, Zhu Dekun, Zhu Xitong, Cheng Shuangquan, Wang Guangtian, Han Ruben, Ji Songgao, Sun Yicai, Wang Yiming, Han Rugen, Chen Hengkuan, Yu Laojiang, Yin Yonggui, Li Haishan, Huang Amao, Xu Fuchang, Xing Yueqing, Bao Degao, and 20 others were acquitted and released. Ma Taihe, Lu Deguang, Dai Rugui, and three others were each sentenced to three months in prison. However, the detective attorney expressed disagreement in court with the acquittal of Cang Gongsen and 20 others. Therefore, the 20 people each paid a deposit to ensure their appearance if an appeal was made by the detective agency. Lu Deguang and three others declared in court that they were dissatisfied and filed an appeal. The judge ordered each of them to pay a deposit of 300 yuan within the appeal period. In addition, the Rickshaw Pullers Association decided to petition the Municipal Government, the Municipal Party Committee, and the Social Affairs Bureau within days because their members were insulted without cause.</p>

<h3 id="e119">The Case of Thirteen Native Banks Suing the Continental Bank for Confirmation of Bond-Receipt Contracts - The Plaintiff Refutes the Defendant's Response in Six Points - The First Special Court Scheduled a Continued Hearing Today to Summon Both Parties <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The Continental Bank previously entered into a contract with 13 native banks, including Huafeng, Runfeng, Yuanfeng, Zhentai, Changshun, Yisheng, Fuchang, Yuzhong, Wanmao, Huatong, Demao, Hengmao, and Zhengkang, to receive a total of 1.75 million yuan in Central and Southern Bank banknotes. Each bank deposited 40% cash as collateral, and the Continental Bank paid interest on the collateral at a weekly rate of 6.5%. However, since the Ministry of Finance promulgated the Unified Currency System Issuance Order on November 4 of last year, the Continental Bank has used this as an excuse to demand that the banks cancel the bond-receipt contracts they had signed. After the banks sent representatives Ma Wenxiang, Liu Ximeng, Yin Huanzhi, and others to negotiate with Ye Fuxiao, the manager of the Continental Bank, without success, they retained attorney Zhan Jifeng to file a lawsuit against the Continental Bank in the First Special District Court to confirm the contract and pay interest. A hearing was held once, as reported in the previous newspaper. It is now learned that the Continental Bank submitted a written response to the court a few days ago, listing eight reasons. The court then sent the response to the plaintiff, and the plaintiff's attorney, Zhan Jifeng, filed a reply refuting each point, stating that upon examining the reasons given by the defendant, they may appear reasonable on the surface, but upon actual investigation, there is no evidence to support them. Therefore, a summary of the reply is provided below:</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance's implementation of the Unified Currency System on November 4 of last year only prohibited the use of hard silver ingots. It did not prohibit the use of banknotes specially issued by private banks. Not only was it not prohibited, but it was also clearly stated in the announcement that all silver coins, such as those exchanged for the aforementioned specially issued banknotes, would also be allowed to circulate. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance's order to unify the currency system had no impact on the current status of the plaintiff's promotion of Central and Southern banknotes. The matter is very clear. Unexpectedly, the defendant used this order to cancel the plaintiff's rights and interests with far-fetched reasons. Regardless of law or reason, it is difficult to allow. As for the so-called Central and Southern banknotes that have been printed but not issued cannot be implemented, and the banknotes that have already been issued will also be gradually withdrawn, the former should be increased in issuance depending on the bank's own needs. If the banknotes currently issued are sufficient for use, then even without an explicit order from the Ministry of Finance, there is no need to increase the issuance. However, the defendant listed it as one of the reasons for terminating the contract, which lacks basis. The latter, the so-called gradual withdrawal, the meaning of the word "gradual" has a broad boundary. Has the currency already begun to be gradually withdrawn? Are the withdrawals the unmarked notes promoted by the plaintiff? The defendant did not make a clear statement. Moreover, more than two months have passed since the bank received the order. If the statement of gradual withdrawal is not false, then a large amount should have been withdrawn during this long period. Why not declare the exact amount in the defense to prove their statement? According to the Civil Procedure Law, a party seeking a judgment from the court that is favorable to them must bear the burden of proof. Now, the defendant is making empty claims without presenting any evidence. This is one reason why the contract cannot be terminated. The reasons stated in the second and third points of the defendant's defense are nothing more than the fact that since the Ministry of Finance issued the order to unify the currency system, the plaintiff can no longer continue to perform the contract. Without hearing or knowing the reasons, the defendant cannot say that the reasons are reasonable. The fact is that on the plaintiff's side, there is absolutely no situation of being unable to continue to perform. The reason why they cannot continue to perform is actually because the defendant is taking advantage of the opportunity and not following the fourth and fifth articles of the contract in order. Instead, they blame the plaintiff for not being able to fulfill their mission. Inverting right and wrong, nothing is more extreme. The government's implementation of the unified currency policy only prohibits the use of hard silver ingots, as mentioned above. At the same time, it does not prohibit the use of Central and Southern banknotes. In other words, as long as the Central and Southern banknotes are not prohibited, the rights and obligations under the contract between the two parties will naturally continue for one day. The defendant's so-called purpose of the contract and the continuity of the work are eliminated due to the law, which is all sophistry and not factual. This is two reason why the contract cannot be terminated. In the third point of the defendant's defense, it is stated that the exchange coupons received by the plaintiff are being continuously promoted by the defendant to make them fully circulate on the market. The plaintiff has searched the contract but has not found the words "continuously". Since there is no such term, it can be seen that it was fabricated by the defendant out of thin air. The plaintiff's responsibility is only to exchange the unmarked coupons whenever they are returned (see the defendant's defense statement). The plaintiff has fulfilled this obligation for many years. The defendant said that although the plaintiff wants to receive coupons, there are no coupons to receive, and although they want to promote them, there are no coupons to issue. It is important to know that after the contract was signed, the plaintiff immediately received all the unmarked coupons as per the contract. The statements in the defense are all irrelevant. The reason why the defendant is fabricating stories is nothing more than to know that they are wrong and intend to confuse the public. This is three reason why the contract cannot be terminated. In the fourth point of the defendant's defense, it is said that the benefits enjoyed are very large, and then it is said that the plaintiff is妄think of profits without labor, as if the plaintiff has actually obtained some kind of luxury. Knowing that the contract between the two parties, as the defendant said, one party must fulfill its obligations before it can demand the payment of rights. On the plaintiff's side, the obligations fulfilled in accordance with the contract cannot be said to be not important. For example, in Article 6 of the contract, if the defendant exchanges the unmarked coupons, if the plaintiff does not perform in accordance with the provisions of Articles 4 and 5 of the contract, then the cash advanced by the defendant shall be calculated in full according to the Shanghai market discount rate, plus 4.5 yuan (that is, at least 9% interest per month per thousand yuan). If the daily discount rate increases, it shall be increased accordingly. Also, as in Article 4 of the contract, if the plaintiff sends someone to the defendant to exchange the unmarked coupons, all responsibilities such as theft and loss during the round trip shall be borne by the plaintiff. Think about it, according to the contract, the responsibility borne by the plaintiff is so great, and the security deposit only has 40%, which can earn a few percent interest per year, while 60% does not calculate interest. The plaintiff's responsibility is so great, and the interest earned is so small. However, in the defendant's defense, they still exaggerate and say that the plaintiff has received generous benefits. Examining their intention, it is nothing more than because the termination of the contract has no legal basis, so they specially lay out the benefits in order to win the sympathy of the society and avoid criticism. How can a contract that has been legally established be protected by law and allowed to be arbitrarily terminated? This is four reason why the contract cannot be terminated. The fifth and sixth points of the defendant's defense are either a repetition of the meaning or have little relevance to this case, so there is no need to say more. As for the seventh point, the so-called reduction in currency circulation is not enough to compensate for the loss. If that is the case, then they should welcome the plaintiff for their inability to circulate it, so why take the excuse to terminate the contract? The wording is contradictory and self-defeating. This is five reason why the contract cannot be terminated. The eighth point of the defendant's defense refers to the plaintiff's claim for interest on late payment as an unearned profit, which is really inappropriate. It is stipulated in the Civil Code that if a payment has a definite deadline, the debtor shall be liable for late payment from the expiration date of the deadline. The law has clear provisions, so why allow a strong defense? In this case, the security deposit paid by the plaintiff to the defendant, its 40% annual interest, should be paid at the end of each year in accordance with Article 3 of the contract. Then, from the end of the 24th year of the Republic of China, the defendant should bear the interest on late payment. What is the benefit without labor? This is six reason why the contract cannot be terminated. This case is related to the financial community's receipt of bonds, which involves a large amount of money, so the money industry in this city attaches great importance to it. The First Special Court is scheduled to continue the trial this afternoon by Judge Huang Daxi. At that time, the representatives and lawyers of both parties will have another round of eloquence.</p>
<p>Eight hundred counterfeit banknotes of one yuan were taken back to the police station. The next day, they were sent to the Second Special Court for trial by Judge Li Changnian. Because the attorney of the Police Department requested detention and postponement of investigation, and to arrest and prosecute the accomplices at large, the court questioned Yao and ordered the defendant to be detained and rescheduled for further hearing on the 18th. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. It is now learned that on the day of this case's hearing, the detectives learned that the defendant's accomplices were hiding in a house at No. 159 Jiale Road. They rushed to the location and first arrested the landlord Ding Changhai (52 years old, from Anhui) and his wife Ding Fang (50 years old, from Hubei). They also arrested Zai Changheng (38 years old, from Jiangbei) and his mistress Xia Chen (30 years old, from Hanyang) in the storehouse. They found a package of counterfeit banknotes (the same style as the old version of the Bank of China previously seized) in the room, totaling 21, as well as a package of opium of various sizes, weighing more than ten taels, and a package of counterfeit lead double hao coins, totaling more than one hundred pieces. They were all taken to the police station for detention. Detectives were dispatched to guard the agency. In the afternoon, Tang Haisheng (35 years old, from Hubei, residing at No. 96 Gongshun Lane, Wuma Road), Wang Fengshan (42 years old, from Hubei, working on the Taikoo Company's Shashi steamer), Zou Ciheng (62 years old, from Hubei, residing at No. 98 Caishi Road), and Wu Haiyuan (36 years old, from Hubei, cohabitating with Zou) were subsequently arrested. A small number of counterfeit banknotes and counterfeit silver coins were found on each person. They were taken back to the police station. A total of eight accomplices, men and women, were arrested. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. The attorney of the Police Department, Yao Zhao, presented the case, requesting postponement until the 18th for joint investigation with Yao Yunqi, and then filing a lawsuit for investigation. Wang Zhongfa, the detective in charge, reported the arrest of the defendants, stating that it is now known that the defendants arrested later were going to buy counterfeit banknotes and that a detailed report would be given after the investigation. The evidence, such as counterfeit banknotes, lead double hao coins, and opium, was presented to the court. Among the defendants questioned, only Xia Chen admitted to selling, and that she had recently become acquainted with Zai Changheng and that he did not know about her selling counterfeit banknotes. The other defendants all denied the charges. Judge Xiong Huicui verified the confessions and approved the rescheduling of the trial to the 18th to be heard jointly with Yao Yunqi. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>

<p>The Route 4 public bus of the Municipal Public Utility Bureau's Public Bus Management Office was originally scheduled to reach Dapu Bridge. Due to the need to add revetments or drive wooden piles along the river in the Dapu Road area, the implementation was delayed. It is now learned that the above project is nearing completion and is scheduled to extend to Dapu Bridge starting January 10th. It is also heard that Route 4 vehicles are divided into red-plated and black-plated types. The black-plated Route 4 goes directly to Dapu Bridge and returns along the original route. The red-plated vehicles do not go to Dapu Bridge but turn around at Xieqiao.</p>

<p>The Hongfei Transport Company on the Hanghui Road has entered into a contract with the Zhongming Machinery Company in this city to install thirty Zhongming coal-fired instead of oil furnaces. The first unit, along with a gasoline-powered vehicle, departed from Hangzhou for a test drive on the 11th of this month. The results were excellent. The return trip from Anhui to Hangzhou was even faster and arrived at the station on time on the 12th. It was observed that the road has extremely high slopes, and old-fashioned gasoline-powered vehicles sometimes find it difficult, but the coal-fired vehicle, fully loaded with three tons of goods, had such good results. Furthermore, compared to gasoline consumption, it can save more than 70%, which is truly admirable.</p>

<p>Yesterday at 11:03 AM, a Chongming manure and ash boat owned by Cui Linjiang was sailing north in the river near Beichenjiazhui in Donggou, under sail. At that time, the No. 3 ferry, traveling from Shanghai to Wusong, passed by. It was parallel to the sailboat. The ferry sounded its horn as usual. Suddenly, the sailboat turned to the left and crossed the bow of the ferry. The ferry immediately stopped and reversed, but the sailboat's sail was caught by the wind and formed a T-shape with the ferry, causing it to collide and capsize. The ferry crew immediately rescued four people on the spot. Two of them went to another sailboat with their colleagues, while the other two were taken to Gaoqiao on the ferry and sent to the hospital for medical treatment. Both parties reported to the Gaoqiao Public Security Bureau and the Water Patrol Team separately.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Amicable Settlement in the Case of Shanghai Art College Owing Rent <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Art College's premises at 440 Caishi Road, French Concession, is the property of the Yongxi Hall of the Zheshao Guild Hall (commonly known as the Shaoxing Guild Hall) on Liyuan Road, Nanshi. The Shanghai Art College rented the premises for a monthly rent of 760 yuan, and a lease contract was signed. Recently, due to the Art College's accumulation of rent arrears that have not been cleared, the landlord, the Yongxi Hall of the Zheshao Guild Hall, through its legal representative Wei Hongwen, appointed lawyer Zheng Wentong as its agent and filed a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Special No. 2 Court. According to the indictment, the defendant, Shanghai Art College, owed 2,815 yuan in rent before December 1933 and 11,400 yuan for fifteen months from October 1934 to December 1935, totaling 14,215 yuan. The plaintiff requested an investigation and prosecution, and because the defendant's movable property and school equipment were limited, the plaintiff requested permission for provisional execution and a judgment to terminate the lease, order the relocation and return of the premises, and bear the litigation costs. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Xiaoke heard the case in the Civil Court No. 7 based on the indictment. The plaintiff's lawyer appeared in court to state the reasons for the lawsuit and the objects of the judgment. The defendant, Shanghai Martial Arts College, sent a representative and its agent, lawyer Chen Tingrui, to appear in court. According to lawyer Chen's defense, the defendant first requested the rejection of the plaintiff's lawsuit and wanted to file a counterclaim. The reason was that the defendant did owe rent, but the facts were inconsistent. The premises rented by the defendant from the plaintiff were very large, and a part of them was sublet to others. In December 1934, due to carelessness, a part of the premises was destroyed by fire. The defendant immediately requested the plaintiff to rebuild them, but the plaintiff ignored the request. After the carelessness, the defendant lost a part of its income, amounting to two or three hundred gold. Now, the plaintiff wants to collect rent according to the original amount, but the defendant can only pay after the premises are rebuilt. Recently, Mr. Wang Xiaolai mediated and ordered the defendant to pay half of the rent arrears first, and the plaintiff would immediately rebuild the premises, as evidenced by a letter from the plaintiff, the Yongxi Hall of the Zheshao Guild Hall. The defendant would be able to pay half of the rent after school starts in March. Now it is the off-season, and there is no money to pay. However, the plaintiff disputed the defendant's willingness to pay half of the amount due to the distinction between old and new rent arrears. The court then persuaded both parties to reach a settlement, ordering the defendant to pay 8,000 yuan by the end of March. After receiving the payment, the plaintiff would immediately rebuild the premises. The defendant would pay half of the rent arrears when paying the new rent each month. If they failed to pay once, the entire amount would be executed. The plaintiff orally agreed to withdraw the request to terminate the lease and relocate. The minutes were recorded by both parties and signed before leaving the court.</p>

<p>At approximately 1:15 PM yesterday afternoon, a fire broke out at the Wang Yiji Tea Shop, No. 10, Lane 126, Avenue Joffre, French Concession. Because the shop's inventory consisted entirely of dried tea leaves, it was extremely flammable and quickly spread. Fire departments from various parts of the French Concession dispatched vehicles to fight the fire, but the fire was too intense and difficult to control. The firefighters continued to fight the fire until 6:00 PM, but it was still not completely extinguished. As a result, all the tea in the shop was destroyed, and the building was completely burned down, resulting in significant losses. The police are currently investigating the cause of the fire.</p>

<p>Tian Su'e, a woman from Hunan province, 22 years old, a student at a university in Shanghai, had been lodging at the home of her aunt, Madam Tian Huang (58 years old), at No. 284 Xinxin Lane, Rue du Père Robert, French Concession. Recently, Su'e moved to the Tianjitang Pharmacy at No. 226 Avenue du Grand Conseil. Su'e's mother in Hunan sent her 30 yuan for expenses through the post office on December 26 of last year. The post office delivered the letter to Tian Huang's address. Huang did not hand it over to Su'e, but secretly opened it. Seeing that there was a draft, she secretly used Su'e's seal, cashed the money from the post office, and spent it. Recently, Su'e received a letter from her mother at Tianjitang asking if she had received the money that was sent. Su'e asked her aunt about it, but Huang not only denied receiving the money but also made excuses to cover it up. Su'e then investigated with the post office and learned the whole story of her aunt's secret use of the seal and illegal cashing of the remittance. She reported it to the French Concession police. Wang Baoming, a detective, went and arrested Tian Huang and detained her. Yesterday morning, she was sent to the Criminal Court No. 8 of the Special No. 2 Court. Gu Shouxi, a lawyer from the police department, explained the case and requested an extension of the investigation before filing a lawsuit. The detective reported the circumstances of the arrest of the defendant and submitted the evidence seized. Judge Qiu Huan'ying interrogated Tian Huang, who confessed to the illegal cashing. The judge ordered a further hearing on the morning of the 16th and ordered the defendant to be detained.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Foreign Inspector of Customs Extorts; Demands 5,000 Yuan from Baoda Silk Company for Twelve Permits; Company Reports to Customs to Send Someone to Negotiate as Agreed; Police Prosecute for Abuse of Power and Accepting Bribes <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Harrianter, a Western inspector of the Jianghai Customs in this city (claiming to be Swedish), went to the Baoda Silk Company at No. 284 Jiujiang Road and the warehouse at No. 11 Rue Amiral Bayle on the morning of January 9th to investigate permits. According to customs regulations, all permits for silk pieces that were sold out last year must be handed over to the customs inspector for reporting and cancellation by the end of this month to prevent the permits from being used to transport other goods to evade taxes. The reward for those who are fined is quite high. The Western officer found that the goods for twelve silk permits had been sold out for a long time and had not been reported. He extorted 5,000 yuan (according to customs regulations, goods that have been sold out and the permits exist, and are not used to transport other goods, are not fined). Sun Yueqing, a Yuyao native working at Beikaier Road, and manager Li of the company, discussed the matter and felt that the Western officer should not extort money. Sun informed Davis, the Western affairs manager, who in turn informed the tax commissioner and sent Qian Shiqing, a Chinese staff member. At approximately 3:00 PM that afternoon, Qian and Sun took 2,400 yuan in marked banknotes and went to Harrianter's house to negotiate. Harrianter agreed to accept 1,000 yuan, but the negotiations failed. Harrianter said that the company's twelve permits should have been reported earlier. According to customs regulations, a fine of 20,000 to 30,000 yuan would have to be paid. He had found a way to settle it for 5,000 yuan, which was very cheap. In the end, they paid him 2,400 yuan and agreed to pay the rest that night. Harrianter wrote down his home phone number and told them to call first when they sent the rest of the money. Sun and Qian both returned to the company and later took another 2,600 yuan in marked banknotes and delivered it to Harrianter. The next morning, Harrianter returned the twelve permits to the company. The day before yesterday, the police were informed and sent Chinese and Western detectives with a search warrant from the First Special District Court to arrest Harrianter at his address. They only found 90 yuan in unmarked banknotes in the iron box, but the original 5,000 yuan was not found. He was taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to Criminal Court No. 3. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, explained the case and filed a public prosecution for abuse of power and accepting bribes. Davis, a Western customs officer, Qian Shiqing, a Chinese staff member, and Sun Yueqing, a customs broker from Baoda Silk Company, testified about the incident. When questioned, Harrianter said that he had been working at the customs for 22 years. When he went to the company's warehouse to investigate permits that day, he did not meet Mr. Sun. Mr. Sun personally came to his house with the twelve permits in question at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. He did not ask him for money. Moreover, he had already cancelled these permits with the customs. After cancellation according to regulations, they should be returned to the original owner. He worked diligently in the customs and was framed by Mr. Sun out of personal animosity. There was no extortion of 5,000 yuan. His pension for 22 years would be 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. He also hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend him and requested to be released on bail. Judge Jiang Shuzhi ordered the defendant to be detained unless he could provide a 50,000 yuan guarantee. If he could not provide a guarantee, he would be detained. The sentence was scheduled to be announced next Monday.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Jin Ziming Sues Daughter-in-Law for Unchastity; Requests Severance of Family Relationship <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Jin Ziming, a local resident living at No. 30 Kaiping Road, Yangjing Town, Pudong, and an employee of the Baidai Company, recently hired a lawyer to sue his daughter-in-law, Jin Jiang, in the local court for unchastity and adultery, and requested permission to sever family ties. Judge Chen Bingxin summoned both parties several times without a resolution. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, Judge Chen specially opened the Fourth Court to continue the hearing. Both parties appeared in court with their lawyers. Jin Ziming testified that he was 64 years old. After his adopted son, Mingchang, died, he separated from his daughter-in-law, Jin Jiang, in June 1932 and gave her the three-story building on the rented nine acres of land to collect rent for a living. Originally, the rent was more than 90 yuan per month. In addition to the daughter-in-law's residence, there were still rooms for rent, which could earn her another 40 yuan per month. She (referring to Jin Jiang) became lascivious in her prosperity and committed adultery. On December 18 of last year, he caught her and handed her over to the police station to sever relations. The defendant, Jin Jiang, testified that she was 40 years old and a native of the area. She claimed that the plaintiff's testimony was completely inconsistent with the facts. She married the plaintiff's eldest son, Mingchang, in 1916. Unfortunately, her husband died of illness in 1921, leaving behind two sons who were still infants. She raised the orphans with hardship and perseverance for more than ten years. In 1932, the plaintiff suddenly had different intentions and separated from her without providing living expenses. She was forced to gather relatives and friends to negotiate with him. As a result, the plaintiff maintained the daily expenses of the daughter-in-law and orphans and signed a written agreement. The plaintiff voluntarily returned the clothing she had brought when she married and 700 yuan. As for the accusation of adultery, she was actually framed by the plaintiff. Fortunately, the police station investigated and released her. Now, the plaintiff intends to abandon her and disregard her, so she requests the judge to order the plaintiff to bear the living expenses of the mother and children for ten years from 1932 or pay 6,000 yuan in one lump sum. After hearing the testimony, the judge ordered the start of the debate, which was considered concluded, and scheduled the announcement of the verdict.</p>

<p>Maria Marakova, a Russian woman, 35 years old, and her husband, an Englishman named P吏司 (36 years old, an engineer at the Shanghai Electric Power Company), lived together in Apartment No. 1, Lane 750, Route Ghisi. The couple had been married for more than eight years. The night before last, they had a quarrel. Subsequently, the husband left in a huff, saying to his wife that he did not want to return. The wife ordered the servant Peng Wanyu to light the stove in her room for warmth. The next morning at 7:00 AM, Peng planned to go to the wife's bedroom to wait for instructions, but found the door tightly closed. He knocked but received no response. Peng did not suspect anything else and assumed that the wife was still asleep. At around 10:00 AM, the husband returned from outside and saw that the door had not been opened. He broke open the door and entered, only to find the wife naked and bloody, stiff on the bed. He reported it to the Hongkou Police Station, which dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. The body was taken to the autopsy room on Fielun Road. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Zhang Zongru of the First Special District Court, along with two forensic doctors, Wei and Zhang, and clerk Wang Zuyi, arrived at the scene. After examining the body, the Chinese head constable Yin Xingsheng reported the previous situation. The husband, P吏司, and the sister of the deceased, Marakova, claimed that the cause of death was unknown and requested an autopsy. Mr. Zhang approved the request and ruled that the Russian woman, Maria Marakova, died under mysterious circumstances. Based on the request of the husband and sister for an autopsy, it should be approved to be handed over to the forensic doctor for autopsy, and the hearing was rescheduled.</p>

<p>The railroad bridge built by the Jiangnan Railway Company at Dangtu River in Anhui Province, due to the difficulty and expense of the project, used to collect tolls from commercial vehicles passing through the bridge to subsidize the project.

It is reported that the above measures have been notified by the Transportation Committee of the Five Provinces and Cities to the Municipal Public Utility Bureau, and by the bureau to the Taxi Industry Association.</p>

<p>Song Jusheng, a native of Huzhou, residing at No. 13, Tongkang Lane, Mintiniyin Road in the French Concession, has no legitimate occupation. He specializes in impersonating charitable organizations to solicit donations. He previously impersonated the company commander of the First Company of the Special Service Battalion of the 78th Division of the National Revolutionary Army to solicit donations from all sectors of society. Recently, Zhang Zhen, a native of Jiangyin residing at No. 8, Tongkang Lane, suddenly told Song, "This approach of yours will not gain people's trust. It would be better to impersonate charitable enterprises." Thereupon, the two collaborated to print donation ledgers and stamps of the Shanghai Charitable Organizations Federation. Song then went out to solicit donations. On the 11th of the month, Song went to the home of Yang Zili at No. 3, Lane 272, Wuchang Road. He claimed that the organization was currently running a shelter in the Nanshi area and was short of funds. Therefore, he was specifically soliciting donations, requesting people to be charitable and contribute generously. He also presented a newspaper clipping about the shelter to gain trust. At the time, Yang suspected Song's behavior and asked about the details of the Shanghai Charitable Organizations Federation. Song's answers were vague. Yang realized it was an impersonation and summoned Detective Chen Xikang and Officer No. 1363 to arrest him and take him to the Hongkou Police Station. Zhang Zhen was subsequently apprehended. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Fifth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu prosecuted them for attempted fraud under Article 339, Section 2 of the Criminal Law. When questioned, the defendants confessed without hesitation. The police lawyer, having examined the circumstances of the case, believed that they had committed the crime of habitual fraud under Article 340 of the Criminal Law. Therefore, he amended the indictment. Furthermore, considering the crime of forging seals, the police were considering whether to add another charge. Therefore, he requested the court to grant an adjournment for the hearing. Zhan Liangce reviewed the report and ordered the case to be rescheduled for another hearing. The two defendants were remanded to custody.</p>

<p>After the three municipal rehabilitation hospitals for addicts in South and North Shanghai expanded their beds and admitted addicts, it is now known that the Public Security Bureau has been sending addicts for rehabilitation as usual. The South and North Shanghai rehabilitation hospitals for addicts admitted seventy-two addicts in one day. The rehabilitation hospital for convicts also sent and transferred fourteen addicts for verification, a significant number. It is estimated that hundreds of addicts have yet to be sent for rehabilitation. After the expansion of each hospital, it should be sufficient to accommodate them. Therefore, there will certainly be no problem in completing the rehabilitation within a short period. The actual number of beds expanded in each hospital is as follows: the convict hospital increased from two hundred to three hundred, the South Shanghai hospital from one hundred to one hundred and eighty, and the North Shanghai hospital from two hundred and fifty to five hundred. The original beds in each hospital totaled five hundred and fifty. Now, the total has increased to nine hundred and eighty, an increase of four hundred and thirty beds.

<p>Since the Ministry of Finance implemented the unified currency system, domestic exchange rates have tended to be uniform. The Shanghai Banking Association subsequently proposed abolishing the affiliated Bank Market Committee. After several consultations among the banks, it was generally agreed that the establishment of the Market Committee was originally intended to provide member banks with opportunities to allocate exchange positions, connect with industry colleagues, and seek convenience in business handover through market meetings. It should not cease all secondary work simply because the domestic exchange market has been standardized by China's Central Bank. It is reported that the majority of banks have agreed, and the name of the association will remain. The daily market meeting will continue to be held at 9:00 AM as usual. However, future association affairs will focus on reporting interbank lending rates, silver coin imports and exports, domestic and foreign reserves, and investigating the profits and losses of the financial industry and the rise and fall of various industries. This will allow the banks in attendance to send staff to exchange and copy reports, thereby understanding financial trends and seeking mutual benefits for the industry.</p>

<p>The Chinese Seamen's Organizations Federation sent a letter to this newspaper stating, "To the editor: We were surprised to read a report in a certain newspaper about the KMT Party Headquarters banning our organization.

Furthermore, a Yang special representative was dispatched and scheduled to convene a meeting with responsible individuals from all parties on the 14th (today).

<p>To the Editor: According to our client, Ms. Xu Huang, the wife of Mr. Xu, today he saw a report in your newspaper's local news section titled "Young Woman from Nanxun Sold into Prostitution by Pimp Shop in Collusion with Madame Xu Huang (Note: This newspaper wrote Xu Wang, not Xu Huang) at No. 42, Daqing Lane, Nanjing Road." He was extremely surprised. This is because our client was implicated in a loan as an intermediary and was unjustly detained. The case is still under investigation. Although it has been heard twice, neither the plaintiff nor the police mentioned the name "Madame Xu Huang." Moreover, in terms of the facts, Xu Huang's husband is a legitimate businessman, and there is no prostitution in their home. We do not know where the name "madame" came from. Moreover, the bail was approved by this lawyer based on the client's illness and in accordance with the law. It is not known to this office that any information had been given to anyone. Therefore, this lawyer has been specifically commissioned to formally request your newspaper to make a correction. I am sending this letter for your review and action. Sincerely, Lawyer Shi Jiutang, January 12.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Theft Case at Minhua Primary School: Incomplete and Untrue Inside Story; Female Teacher's Waistcoat and Shorts Brought to Court as Evidence; Dispute over Rights and Jealousy Leading to This Situation <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Yu Shangxun, the principal of Minhua Primary School, a Ningbo native, located at No. 10, Lane 251, Weihaiwei Road, had a Western suit and other items worth 77 yuan stolen on October 5th of last year. Recently, teacher Ding Jiasheng (also known as Ding Hao), a local native, was discovered to be a prime suspect. Therefore, on the 4th of the month, he reported to the Chengdu Road Police Station, instructing Detective Yang Xinzheng to arrest Ding. In Ding's suitcase, four pawn tickets were found, two of which belonged to a portion of the stolen items from Yu. He was then prosecuted in the First Special Court under Article 320 of the Criminal Law. Because the defendant claimed that the cause of this case was due to a love affair, specifically because the defendant's lover, Shen Shuqing (also a teacher at the school), had shifted her affections to Principal Yu, he was framed and slandered. The court considered it necessary to summon Shen Shuqing from Foshan, so it ordered a postponement. Ding Jiasheng was allowed to be released on bail of 100 yuan. Yesterday morning was the date for the continued hearing of this case. Many men and women from the education community attended the court to listen. First, Officer Jiang Baolian of the police station stated that the subpoena for Shen Shuqing had been delivered by the police and received by Yu Shangxun. Today, Shen has complied with the summons and arrived in court, requesting the court to question her. Yang Guanchang took the initiative to instruct Yu Shangxun to the case, telling him that if the defendant had committed theft, why would he hide the pawn tickets in his suitcase as evidence for the future? Wouldn't he be more likely to make it known and deliberately publicize that there were pawn tickets worth five or sixty yuan so that people would report him? However, Yu firmly insisted that it was Ding Jiasheng who had stolen the items without a doubt. The fact that the pawn tickets were found in his suitcase and that he had asked someone to mediate afterwards all proved it. The court then instructed Shen Shuqing to come to court. According to her statement, she had been acting on behalf of Principal Yu since October 1st of last year because he was suffering from a foot ailment, until the 10th of that month. On the morning of the 6th of this month, she went to the school to work and saw that the lock on the principal's office door had been broken. She entered the room and saw that the clothes hanging on the clothes rack and placed in the cabinet had disappeared. Knowing that there had been a theft, she reported it to the police station and asked Yu Shangxun about the number of stolen clothes, made a list, and submitted it to the police station. Police lawyer Jiang immediately asked if there were any of her clothes or belongings in the defendant's suitcase. She replied, "Not a single item." He asked, "Do you live in the same room with the defendant?" She replied, "No." Then, witness Zhu Bin, a teacher at the school, submitted a case, proving that Shen had planted the pawn tickets in the defendant's suitcase on the 2nd of the month (as reported in the previous newspaper). He also stated that Principal Yu was afraid that I would come to court to testify on the 6th, so he left a letter for me on the 5th, instructing me not to change the exam subjects for the 6th, intending to control me, while other teachers in the school did not receive such letters. He then submitted the letter to the court. The court asked Zhu whether the principal was at school on the evening of October 5th. He replied, "Not at school, he stayed in a small house." Shen Shuqing completely denied the points of framing made by Zhu Bin, stating that she had filed a separate lawsuit against Zhu and others. When questioned, Ding Jiasheng stated that this case was completely due to a love triangle and jealousy. Shen's statement that there was nothing of hers in his suitcase was not true. Her close-fitting waistcoat, shorts, qipao, etc., were all in his suitcase and had been brought to court today. Because of the plaintiffs' framing and slander, he had suffered significant damage to his spirit and reputation. Therefore, he was filing a counterclaim, requesting that the plaintiff be punished with the crime of false accusation under Article 169, Section 2 of the Criminal Law, and be ordered to issue a statement in the newspaper and compensate him for one yuan in damages. He then presented the underwear and other items to the court. However, Shen denied that the clothing belonged to her. The court then instructed Shen to wear one of the qipaos and then announced the start of the debate. Lawyer Sun Shi'an, representing the initial plaintiff, argued that this case was actually caused by a struggle for rights and jealousy. Therefore, he requested that the defendant be declared innocent. Finally, Ding also claimed that he knew Shen's hidden marks on her body well. The court, having understood, announced the end of the debate and set the date for sentencing this week. The defendant's counterclaim should be filed separately.</p>

<p>The 7th China Youth Men's and Women's Basketball League is scheduled to begin competing at the China Youth Sports Hall at 5:00 PM today. The pre-registration was exceptionally enthusiastic, with a total of thirty-seven teams participating. Four group championships have been set up for schools, banks, businesses, and women. Each Tuesday and Thursday, one match will be played. Each time there are five matches. Once the association's volleyball league concludes, Saturday will be added for a final decision, with three matches required each week. The competition will use a single round-robin system, and the rules will follow the basketball rules of 1935-36 announced by the Physical Education Association. Because there are nineteen participants in the business group, they are divided into three sections for competition. There are only four teams in the women's group, so it is scheduled to begin early next month. The league was originally scheduled to open before Christmas last winter, but due to insufficient preparation, it was postponed to today. Last year, only three groups were set up for schools, banks, and women. The championship in the school group was won by the YMCA High School, the bank group by the Shanghai Bank, and the women's group by the Black Hawk team. The business group is a newly added one this year. In addition to the exceptionally complicated participants in the previous season, the spirit was inevitably distracted. Therefore, this year, the recruitment was changed to an invitation to improve performance. There will be five games played today, one each in the school, bank, and business groups 1, 2, and 3. In addition, due to the small size of the sports hall, those who wish to visit will be charged a small entrance fee of one corner to show restrictions. The order for today is recorded as follows.</p>

<p>The 4th United Cup Tournament has recently entered a tense period. In the game between Langya and Weisha the night before last, the competition was very intense, with the outcome fought with great difficulty. Langya won by a score of four to three.

Although Langya is known for its brave generals and abundant talent, the team that played last night was incomplete and dispirited. Such a strong enemy is a major taboo for military strategists.

<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott Translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>"I don't believe you would do it. You sometimes like to fight, but you don't lie. I don't believe you would steal," said Nat, shaking his head to show that it was impossible.</p>
<p>"I have done worse things. I used to lie like mad; now I think it is too much trouble. When I ran away from Mr. Bell's, I stole things from the garden to eat on the way; so you see I am a bad lot," said Dan, in the rough, impudent tone which he was lately trying so hard to get rid of.</p>
<p>"Oh, Dan! Don't say it was you! I'd rather it had been any other boy," cried Nat, so full of sorrow that Dan was touched, and involuntarily showed it, for he turned away with a queer look on his face, though he only answered:</p>
<p>"I don't want to say anything about it. But you needn't fret; we'll get along all right; you see if we don't."</p>
<p>His face and his manner gave Nat a new idea; he clasped his hands tight, and said eagerly:</p>
<p>"I think you know who did it. If you do, make him tell, Dan. They all hate me without any reason, and it is very hard. I don't think I can bear it much longer. If I had any place to go, I'd leave Plumfield, which I love so much, and go somewhere else; but I haven't got such a body as you, nor your courage; so I must stay and wait till somebody tells them I did not lie."</p>

<p>Yesterday's gold market started weak, but buying interest picked up due to low prices, enabling a rebound. The overall trend fluctuated around the $40 mark. As the settlement date approached, the market remained relatively stable. In the early morning, with overseas silver markets in the UK and US closed, the forward silver price in Montreal rose slightly by one to three and a half points. Exchange rates remained high. The London gold price fell by one penny. Reports indicated that the Central Bank had initiated gold loan collateral, but the monthly interest rate was as high as 7% (around $8 for forward contracts). Although concerns about the settlement date were slightly alleviated, the US Treasury Department was still reportedly in contact with us to purchase silver, with the first batch priced at 65 cents per ounce. Selling pressure remained difficult to suppress. Off-exchange trading opened lower, falling to $37.80 due to supply from Fuxingyong, but Yuanyangyong Qingfayong Dadecheng Huixiang and others took advantage of the low prices to buy, pushing the price up to over $40. The Central Bank's official exchange rates were announced, with no changes in the UK and US. The customs gold unit remained unchanged. The standard gold loan collateral price was lowered to $1145.90. Dadecheng sold gold bars at high prices, causing the price to fall back below $40. The morning opened with low prices, and the trend continued downward due to oversupply. Central and Jiaotong banks seized the opportunity to buy at low prices, and short sellers covered their positions, allowing the price to rebound above $40. At this point, HSBC's official exchange rates remained unchanged, and banks traded forward contracts, stabilizing market sentiment. The price fluctuated around the $40 mark, but as buying interest gradually recovered, the price soon rebounded again. Large players supplied gold bars at high prices, and prices gradually stabilized after reaching a high point. The silver balancing tax remained unchanged. There was still much fluctuation, and market sentiment gradually turned uncertain. Later, the market lacked sustained buying interest and was once pressured by sellers, falling back below $40. However, due to large short sellers covering their positions, the situation stabilized at noon. The after-market was slightly weak, but was able to rebound after opening. Regarding the news about silver exports, Reuters' report was partially acknowledged. Banks bought US dollars and sold British pounds, stabilizing exchange rates, which also led to price increases throughout the city. HSBC bought US dollars, and Indian silver prices were reported to have shrunk by 10 annas. Buying interest increased slightly, causing a rebound, but prices leveled off again after reaching a high point. The forward premium yesterday fell to around $4.50, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 7%.

<h3 id="e190">Foreign Exchange Rates Over the Past Year (Continued 3) <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Time Shanghai to London telegraphic transfer (yuan per British pence) London silver price (per ounce in British pence) October 1934 16.697 23.56 November 1934 15.889 24.25 December 1934 16.342 24.375 January 1935 16.938 24.584 February 1935 17.778 24.818 March 1935 19.085 27.38 April 1935 19.109 30.986 May 1935 20.125 33.865 June 1935 19.620 32.346 July 1935 18.770 30.389 August 1935 17.630 29.476 September 1935 17.743 29.25 October 1935 17.346 29.368</p>
<p>The increase in Shanghai's British exchange rate shows a consistent trend with London silver prices, which has been a unique phenomenon since the beginning of this year. This is different from last year when China's foreign exchange rates moved away from silver prices. However, this is only a difference in degree. If Shanghai's foreign exchange rates are compared with London silver prices, there is still a significant distance in exchange rates, which is why the collection of the balancing tax is still important.</p>
<p>Since the United States implemented silver nationalization last August, China's silver has flowed out in large quantities as silver prices have risen. However, this year, the outflow of silver has come to an end, and there is even a surplus, which is clear from the table below.</p>
<p>Comparison of Shanghai's Silver Import and Export in 1935 (Note 5)</p>
<p>However, the smuggling of silver cannot be reflected in the table above, so the actual situation is not so simple.</p>
<p>The reasons why the outflow of silver has stopped are:</p>
<p>Due to the collection of the balancing tax, it is no longer profitable to export silver.</p>
<p>China's foreign exchange rates have gradually risen, and the difference between foreign exchange rates and silver prices is small, so it is also unprofitable to export silver.</p>
<p>The China's central bank and Shanghai foreign banks have reached a gentleman's agreement, reducing the manipulation of foreign banks.</p>
<p>Fourth,</p>
<p>Those in the economic sector who are directly related to the rise and fall of foreign exchange rates are none other than import and export trade. Let us try to observe the situation of this year's exchange rate changes and import and export trade: (Note 6)</p>
<p>Trade has a seasonal relationship, so it is impossible to observe its general trend in the short term. However, foreign exchange rates have a direct impact on it. Even if the time is very short, a general idea can be seen. The increase in China's foreign exchange rates indicates an increase in the purchasing power of China's currency. In theory, China's imports should greatly increase. However, looking at the table above, although imports gradually increased from January to May, after removing the seasonal impact, how much of the increase is due to the increase in currency purchasing power cannot be immediately determined. According to recent customs reports, the total value of China's import and export trade in the first half of this year decreased compared with the same period in previous years. The total value of imports decreased by 24,394,541 yuan compared with the same period last year, and exports decreased by 9,175,041 yuan compared with the same period last year (Note 7). The increase in imports cannot be achieved simply by increasing the purchasing power of currency. If the purchasing power of currency increases on one side, but the social economy of the other side is sluggish and the general purchasing power is low, then consumption will inevitably not rise. This should be taken as a warning by those who use dumping policies to seize markets in other countries.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Securities - Heavy Pressure <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Bonds are Difficult to Raise Temporarily; Near High, Far Low, Hedging Cannot Be Swapped; Gold Shorts Fell the Most, Dropping $1</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange market remained mired in rumors of interest rate cuts and postponements on bonds, unable to recover. Market sentiment remained depressed. Occasional rallies were inevitably suppressed, and the bulls often succumbed to high pressure, unable to rise. Market prices were near high and far low, making it impossible to swap existing hedges. The tens of millions of dollars of spot goods in February would inevitably have to be delivered upon maturity. If this were to happen, the future squeezes would be quite severe, as the chips would be crowded and naturally loose. The spread of the North China Incident further discouraged the bulls. The trend was completely dominated by the bears, so the future is still one of inability to rise. Even if there is a rebound, it will be very temporary. A total of three sessions were conducted yesterday, with many forward transactions, and selling pressure was still extremely strong. Sellers were mostly Nos. 5, 33, and 71, while there were very few buyers. Gold shorts fell the most, dropping more than one yuan, while the rest fell by only two or three cents to seven or eight cents. The settlement was still lacking in energy. Nos. 4, 11, and 34 were all sold, while Nos. 13, 16, 35, and 78 were all bought. This month's military cuts fell by seven cents, while the rest fell by only two or three cents. Only one session was conducted in the afternoon. The short-selling of No. 48 was slightly offset by retail investors, and most rebounded by one or two cents, but the tail remained weak. If there is a sharp fall, there may be a reaction. Yesterday's market price results were consistently continued to fall by three to five cents to one yuan and one and a half cents. The total number of transactions was 23,010,000 yuan. The results of the increases and decreases are compared in the table below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<p>US Stocks Show Signs of Loosening at Closing</p>
<p>Xinhua Foreign Company reported yesterday (11th) that the exchange rate of the US dollar against foreign exchange fell sharply. Foreign observers believe that President Roosevelt's extension of the Gold Reserve Act is an admission that the crisis has not yet passed, and are also quite worried about the legislative situation of inflation. However, the stock market rose unevenly, indicating that the views of American observers are different from those of Europe. The market was extremely active, with oil, public utilities, and automobile stocks rising slightly in the early morning, but then rebounded due to profit-taking by the bulls. Small exchange stocks were mixed, and the bond market rose. Half-day trading totaled 164 million shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Yarn and Cotton; Very Little Excitement in Yarn and Cotton Markets <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is firm, and the situation is becoming more stable. Market transactions are unusually deserted. As the accounting period approaches, most are preparing to close, and business is turning clear, with no excitement to speak of. Changfeng's bulls have closed, and Yuda's shorts have covered, offsetting each other. The overseas yarn and cotton situation is also calm.</p>
<p>Changfeng Cuts Longs, Yuda Covers Shorts</p>
<p>The pre-market opening for yarn was slow, with each month advancing slowly. Great Orphan Brand (大孤) Three-Ply yarn slightly rebounded. Most transactions in the market were scattered, so there was no significant change in market prices. However, spot yarn sales are still holding up. The results of the pre-market opening show that each month rose by 2, 4, 5, and 6 cents compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening was calm, with no major changes. Changfeng's bulls closed, and Yuda's shorts covered. Both bulls and bears have shortened their chips. The results show that each month rose again by 2, 3, 4, and 5 cents compared to the morning closing price. Sales from Changfeng totaled 500 bales, Yuanyi 200 bales, Yichang 550 bales, Changfeng 1,200 bales, Jinkang 300 bales, Dafeng 550 bales, Hexing 300 bales, and Tonghe 500 bales.

<p>The cotton market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon. The market trend is still weak. However, US cotton continued to rise, and Indian cotton also rose by 3 rupees. Market sentiment slightly improved. However, spot cotton business was worse. As the closing period approaches, yarn factories have temporarily suspended work, and demand is more sluggish.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao's Atmosphere is Peaceful</p>
<p>The pre-market opening for cotton was still strong, with each month rising by 1 to 2 cents. US cotton rose by 3 to 18 points, Indian cotton rose by 1.25 to 2.5 rupees, and Liverpool cotton also rose by more than 10 points. Osaka Three-Ply cotton was unchanged for near-term months, and rose by 2 to 3 cents for far-term months. The market trend was peaceful, and buying and selling were extremely deserted. The results show that each month rose by 1 cent, 1.5 cents to 2 cents compared to the previous day's closing price. The market atmosphere in the afternoon opening was still unremarkable. Renfeng Yuanyi Yichang sold, and Yuda bought. However, there was a lack of those taking delivery this month. The results show that each month fell by 0.5 cents to 1.5 cents compared to the morning closing price. Sales from Tongji totaled 1,400 dan, Jifeng 1,100 dan, Renfeng 1,700 dan, Yuanyi 2,500 dan, Yichang 3,600 dan, Changfeng 1,900 dan, Runkang 3,700 dan, Yikang 1,900 dan, and Dafeng 1,000 dan.

The highest price, your closing price, for the day is as follows.</p>
<p>Factory Demand is Increasingly Quiet Before the Holiday. Spot cotton consumption is turning sluggish. Yarn factories usually temporarily suspend work, so transactions are dull. Source of Yaohua 490 bales, Tonghua 380 bales.</p>

<p>Japanese Yarn</p>
<p>Chinese and British Yarn</p>
<p>Due to poor news from abroad last week, market prices were extremely soft. Afterwards, Liverpool market prices recovered, but local futures traders and speculators sold in large quantities, and there was still no improvement. Indian factories had considerable buying interest, and exporters and brokers also bought. However, due to a lack of stimulating news from abroad, this purchase had no impact on the market. Demand in Europe is poor. It is reported that transactions in the Far East are still smooth. The statistics for last week are attached below (unit: 1,000 bales).</p>

<p>Mills Are Buying to Offset Advance Sales This Month; Customers are Absorbing Forward Contracts</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed a consistent trend of sharp price increases after opening in the morning. Quotations for foreign wheat in Chicago and Canada fell by 1 to 2 cents. However, market sentiment was that the market would soon close this month, and there were less than ten days until the delivery period. Therefore, short sellers bought to cover their positions. The excitement in the market came from this. February started calmly, and then the Nanyang Gang bought, and the market sentiment also improved step by step. The buying interest in other months was also very strong, and the overall situation was good. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the market had risen again. The mills were buying to offset their sales, and the customers were absorbing forward contracts. Some short sellers also bought to cover their positions, so market sentiment became even better. Trading was also brisk, with over 700,000 bales traded in the morning and afternoon, and prices rose by 3 to 4 cents. Looking at the next step, there is still a tendency to continue to rise.</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market was stable in all months after opening in the morning. Foreign wheat prices were reported to be low, but with domestic wheat becoming increasingly scarce and supplies dwindling, coupled with the fact that the flour market was becoming more active, the wheat market was inevitably directly affected. Therefore, prices in all months were 3 to 5 cents higher. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, trading was quieter, but the market was still stable. This month's prices were up by 1 jiao due to a shortage of goods. The spot wheat market was also high. High-quality goods opened at 5 yuan in the morning, and were bought by brokers. Whether it was allocated to the factory or not is not yet certain.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Sudden Influx of Supply Leads to Further Decline in Rice Prices; 140 Rice Ships Arrive in Shanghai; Shipping to Shanghai Before the End of the Year <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there was a sudden increase in supply from various gangs, with a total of over 60 ships arriving (over 12,000 shi of goods). Sales in this street remained sluggish. Therefore, although there were over 4,000 bales, the prices still softened due to the influx of supply. If Houzao japonica rice prices were 5 cents lower, the price of thin indica rice was also 4 to 5 cents lower. Du Yangjian and Yinyuan also fell by a few cents. Bianyuan did not have a wide outlet and was cut by 1 to 2 jiao.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the supply from He Xia was quite strong, with about 70 ships arriving. Sales of white japonica rice in the market remained flat, and wholesalers bought slightly, and the price fell by 1 to 2 jiao. In addition to the small angle following for early rice, the arrival of thin rice was quite strong, and zeroing was normal, and the price was slightly outside the foot. Yangjian high material was upright and beautiful, and the middle was weak. Du Bu Jian was flat and tired, Baiyuan zero demolition was poor, and the price was about 2 angles lower. The prices of other goods were also slightly lower.</p>
<h3 id="e196">The Price of Early Rice is Still Holding <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the supply of early rice kept pouring in. Areas along the Yangtze River and the Wenzhou-Taizhou region saw even stronger arrivals. However, the accumulated stock of early rice and weak local demand caused the market to become sluggish and lifeless. Yet, due to cost considerations, most sellers were unwilling to lower prices to clear their stocks. Moreover, with the end of the year approaching, some sellers were planning to hold on until prices rose again before selling. Therefore, market prices were still holding up. The total daily volume traded included 1,452 bags of Jiangxi rice, 160 bags of Hunan rice, 444 bags of Shashi rice, and 640 bags of Wenzhou-Taizhou-Ningbo rice, all reportedly sold and purchased by businesses in this street.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Silk and Tea: Drastic Decline in Chinese Tea Exports to the United States <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>The United States has historically been the main consumer market for Chinese tea exports. In recent years, due to competition from Indian, Ceylon, Japanese, and Javanese teas, the volume of Chinese tea exports to the United States has decreased from 400,000 chests to 100,000 chests. Last year, due to various factors, exports of Chinese Ping-Shui green tea and both Hunan-Hubei Qimen-Ningzhou black tea to the United States fell sharply to 65,000 chests. The reason for this decline is attributed to the abundant harvests and dumping of cheap tea from India, Ceylon, Japan, and Taiwan in the past year. Furthermore, the quality of Chinese black and green tea has not been pure, and the color and processing methods have deteriorated compared to previous years, which is also a major factor. If reforms are not urgently pursued, the position of Chinese tea in the American market will inevitably gradually decline.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trended flat and struggled to rise. The public association's spot price for No. 24 raw sugar white was 22.45 yuan, down by 0.05 yuan. Transit cargo was 7.25 yuan, with transactions occurring. Dong sugar was quoted at 16.6 yuan, and No. 8 Dong white sugar was quoted at 22 yuan, but no transactions occurred. Transit cargo was 7 yuan, with some transactions. No. 9 sugar was 21.8 yuan, and transit cargo was 6.85 yuan. Mian sugar from the local factory, Zhen Ji No. 1, was 21.4 yuan, while No. 2, 3, 4, and 5 remained unchanged. The price board only showed about a hundred bags of red sugar from bag shops continuing to open, with little price fluctuation. The Guangdong raw white and mian sugar from the Sugar Industry Cooperative Company were priced at the original level, with no changes, but few were interested, leading to a lack of transactions. Furthermore, with the major closing approaching, sales will be temporarily suspended from the 15th.</p>

<p>— Yong Cai</p>
<p>Enveloped in this atmosphere of economic downturn, news of the pleasure quarters in the north is also becoming bleak. The playboys and young men who used to enjoy seeking pleasure are now, due to their depleted wallets, only able to stroke their large coat pockets and sigh in vain.</p>
<p>Although the beginnings of examining prostitutes were initiated by Guan Zhong's "300 female quarters," it was not until the Ming Dynasty that it gradually flourished. At that time, all self-proclaimed romantic literati liked to visit Jin Chan. When in high spirits, they would write several poems and pass them on to friends. Therefore, poems about prostitutes were most abundant in the Ming Dynasty. If we were to carefully collect them and compile a "Three Hundred Poems on Prostitutes," it would indeed be a magnificent masterpiece, not letting Tang poetry monopolize the beauty of the past.</p>
<p>Our country's circumstances differ between the north and the south, so habits also differ. Even small actions reveal personality unintentionally. Take prostitutes for example: Southern prostitutes are accustomed to pouring flattery and playing tricks, using smooth and hypocritical means to win over their lovers. Northern prostitutes, on the other hand, are straightforward and value loyalty. Once they become intimate with a stranger, they treat each other with sincerity and righteousness. This is a very obvious and definite fact.</p>
<p>Lower-class brothels in the north include several types such as "Mo Hei" (touching in the dark) and "Ji Mao Wo" (chicken feather nest), which are places where coolies and rickshaw pullers seek pleasure, paying only a few dozen copper coins per encounter. It is said that the facilities of "Ji Mao Wo" are even simpler than "Mo Hei." In the room, besides a few prostitutes, there is only a pit, with some chicken feathers piled on it, which serves as the "waiting place." This was told to me by a veteran of northern pleasure quarters.</p>
<p>Chen Dasheng of the Ming Dynasty wrote a song mocking northern prostitutes, and although it is only a few dozen sentences long, it fully demonstrates the ability to satirize and describe. It is specially recorded here for your amusement: "A sound of mules and horses passing in front of the door, dust flying, where is the fragrant hoof of a horse returning after treading flowers? Cotton-padded jacket, cotton-padded pants, cotton-padded skirt, bulging, where is the thin silk dress first tried in the spring breeze? Raw scallions, raw garlic, raw chives, pickled and dirty, where is the fragrant mouth grease of secret whispers late at night? Opening her mouth to sing of wronged families, a crooked tune, where is the song of Du Wei's daughter in the spring breeze? Raising a cup to eat shaojiu together, unbearable, where is the fragrant tulip wine of Lanling? A loose bun two feet high on her head, a barbarian girl, where is the high bun and cloud-like hair of a palace style? Where is the rain and clouds, a dirt pit, where is the mandarin duck sleeping in a gilded tent at night? Five qian one liang, the head is held high, then forgotten, where is marrying Liu Lang better than Ruan Lang?"</p>
<h3 id="e201">Legal Suicide <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Jing</p>
<p>Suicide is a sin, we often hear this. Suicide is a criminal act, this is also a law in civilized countries around the world. But in London, there is a "Quick Death Association," successfully organized by several physicians, jurists, priests, and others of standing. Its purpose is to protect those qualified to commit suicide from leaving this world. Their view is that for people suffering from incurable diseases, rather than letting them linger in bed, slowly and painfully heading towards death, it is better to grant them the legal right to quick death, so that they suffer less from the pain of dying.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Weak Animals Surrounded by Enemies <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>Under this goal, one of the founders of the association, the famous physician Sir Moynihan, is preparing to submit a law to Parliament, allowing those who meet the conditions to request quick death, to end their lives in a simple and painless way. The conditions that must be met for quick death are suffering from an incurable disease. In terms of procedures, a written statement of willingness to die must be signed in person. At the time of signing, two of the closest relatives and two qualified doctors must be present to witness and must also sign the death warrant to prove that the person wishing to die is indeed suffering from an incurable disease. This kind of open and legal suicide is truly a rare and ancient event. Suicide with legal protection, those who commit suicide can calmly go to their death, this may not be a gospel for those who commit suicide. But looking at the organization's essence of this Quick Death Association, it is completely based on humanitarianism, so the qualifications of those seeking death are limited to those with incurable diseases. It is known that those who commit suicide due to economic oppression, failed love, etc., really have no need to commit suicide. This point, I hope those who are momentarily impulsive and tired of the world, pay attention to.</p>

<p>Chapter 23: Arguing Vigorously in the Room to File a Lawsuit, Pouring Wine to Renew Old Friendships, Benefits Can Make One Forget Grievances</p>
<p>Just as he said this, the curtain was lifted, and a person in student attire walked in. He took off his hat and nodded to him, saying, "Mr. Jia, I am very presumptuous! But this is the profession of a newspaper reporter, please forgive me." Jia Duocai frowned and said, "Making friends is always welcome, but I am a businessman. I'm afraid there are no materials for you to interview, right?" The visitor laughed, "Finding news materials doesn't necessarily require visiting important people. I believe that Mr. Jia can tell us the truth, then there will be a lot of material." As he spoke, he rubbed his hands and sat down, as if to indicate a little hesitation. But as soon as he was seated, he took out a small diary from his pocket. While flipping it open, he laughed and said, "I just met Commissioner Lan's wife, and she mentioned that there is a problem on Mr. Jia." When Jia Duocai came in, he already knew what he meant, always wanting to muddle through. Now that the other party honestly took out his diary, it was inconvenient to say that this was absolutely not the case, so he forced a smile and said, "A person working outside, taking a temporary family member, it doesn't count for much. Canceling the temporary family member, it's even less worth anything?" The visitor laughed and said, "Does Mr. Jia mean that you don't want Ms. Zhu to come back?" Jia Duocai thought for a while, laughed, "How can she be called Ms. Zhu? You, sir, have raised her personality too high." The visitor laughed, "This is just a casual way of addressing her, you don't have to mind it. If she just leaves you and goes home, what attitude will you take towards her?" Jia Duocai shook his head and said, "I don't want to express any opinions, please forgive me." The visitor laughed, "Mr. Jia is probably preparing to file a lawsuit. But this matter has already involved the women's issue. Those ladies and misses have already regarded Mr. Jia's marriage problem not as a personal matter but as the honor and disgrace of the entire women's circle. The law is nothing more than human feelings. With these women coming forward, the court will have to consider carefully when judging." After saying this, he smiled lightly and looked at Jia Duocai, waiting for his reply. (891)</p>

<h3 id="e204">Firsthand Observations of Abyssinia <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Yun</p>
<p>Since the Italo-Abyssinian War, the country of Abyssinia has been known far and wide. A black country that everyone looks down on dares to confront Mussolini's mighty army, giving the weak and small nations a chance to exhale. Of course, although defeated, it is glorious. The following is a conversation with Mr. Tsuchida Yutaka, the Japanese foreign affairs secretary. He visited Abyssinia last year for inspection, and what he said may be more accurate.</p>
<p>To get to Abyssinia, the most convenient way is to take a ship to Djibouti on the French Somali Coast, where there is a railway that leads directly to the Abyssinian capital. Starting from the station, the road is all desert, not even three-foot shrubs, and black-brown rocks cannot be seen. The train is barely crawling up the plateau, and under the strong sunlight, without black glasses, it is impossible to see anything. Even with the electric fan on, it is still so hot that you want to drink water all the time. When you get to Kineidu in Abyssinia, you are already five thousand feet above sea level. All around are green trees, and the weather is gradually getting cooler. Further south is the village of Awash, full of malarial mosquitoes, so you must use a mosquito net. At night, you can only hear the wind down the mountain and the sound of wolves barking, which is extremely scary. The land gradually rises, and the temperature gradually decreases. When you get near the Abyssinian capital, you can no longer bear a shirt, so you have to put on a coat. In the car, you can see purple valleys all around, with a group of white buildings in the middle. That is the Abyssinian capital, eight thousand feet above sea level.</p>
<p>When the train reaches the Abyssinian capital, there is suddenly thunder and lightning, and a heavy rain, which is a special product of Abyssinia. From May to mid-September is the rainy season, with at least one or two rains a day. After the rain clears and the sun comes out, people wear thick shoulder cloths to protect themselves from the sunlight. The Abyssinian capital is very high, so the summer is as mild as spring and autumn in the northern temperate zone, but the air is thin, which is a drawback.</p>
<p>Abyssinia is called Ethiopia, in eastern Africa, with an area of 350,000 square miles, larger than Japan itself. Although the population is said to be ten million, it is not accurate. The history of the country is nearly four thousand years. At that time, the Queen of Sheba, who came on a long expedition from Arabia, became the ruler of Abyssinia. Because she admired the hero Solomon on the Mediterranean coast, she personally visited him. One night she returned and gave birth to a prince, who was Emperor Menelik I of Abyssinia. So to this day, the people of Abyssinia still boast: "We are the descendants of the prince born of the great king and queen." From Menelik I onwards, there was an imperial autocracy of about two thousand years. Later, the heroes were divided and rebelled one after another. In the 19th century, Menelik II restored Abyssinia, unifying the country with the help of many Italians, so he ceded the northern coastal land to Italy. Also, due to British and French intervention, he ceded the northeast coastal land to Britain and France, while he did not have a way to the sea. So Menelik II can be said to be a restoration, but also a troublemaker who led the wolf into the house. Later, there was indeed a rebellion, and the civil war did not stop. The great Christian masters rose up to establish Menelik II's niece, Zewditu, as queen, and the current Emperor of Abyssinia, Haile Selassie, served as regent. In 1923, with French assistance, she joined the League of Nations. In 1930, the Queen collapsed, and Haile Selassie continued to hold the national position. The Queen's name is Menen, and she has three sons and two daughters. Abyssinia is completely a feudal system. The chiefs of various places are recruiting soldiers, and they gather in the Abyssinian capital every three years to pay their respects. One-third of the country is the Amhara people, who are the true Abyssinian bloodline. They all believe in Christianity and are officials, scholars, and warriors. In addition, there are Muslims and completely ignorant black slaves, who can only be enslaved.</p>
<p>People are martial and warlike, which is the traditional atmosphere. At banquets, they use strange instruments to accompany the dance with swords in song. Their songs mostly describe the story of the victory over Italy in the Battle of Adwa. Because their ancestors had the glory of a great victory over Italy, the people and warriors all despise Roman warriors. In fact, today's Italy is far from what it used to be. Even Britain and France see it as a headache, but the people of Abyssinia still think that they can defeat the Italian army like their ancestors.</p>
<p>The etiquette between friends is very important. When they meet on the road, they often greet each other. Sometimes two people embrace, and two black beards face, rubbing each other. The upper class eats beef and mutton, while the lower class only eats some salty pasta.</p>

<p>— (Yangtze River)</p>
<p>At dusk, the cold wind was blowing sharply. I walked shivering across the intersection of Connaught Road and Jiaozhou Road, but I saw a group of people gathered near the mailbox, shouting, scolding, and laughing. Looking closely, it was a woman who was being bullied.</p>
<p>That woman was no more than twenty-two or three years old, and she was still good-looking. Her clothes were not tattered either, but she kept begging from the windows of the houses where Westerners lived. The patrol came to interfere, pulled her to run, but she refused. He drove her back, but she said, "Where do I have a home!" Then she cried loudly again!</p>
<p>A ticket inspector came down from the bus. Seeing that it was a woman, he used a flashlight to illuminate her face for a long time. Although she was a little shy and annoyed, she did not have the courage to protest!</p>
<p>In the Chinese dictionary, there is only ridicule, no sympathy.</p>

<p>The old man of Chashi Wenshan, sings of righteousness. The sun, moon, rivers, and mountains are shining brightly. The Three Zhus and Six Bridges are buried in the blue earth. Peng Ju's heroic spirit is immortal. See the cypress branches still, a generation of heroes in Shao Bao, more supporting the sky and bathing in the sun. Good scenery, willing to easily bear.</p>
<p>For a long time, the misfortunes of foreign forces have lingered, separating the blue sky. Duke Wan is on the river, after the chieftain is killed. Cutting open the heart and liver to the slaves, Bo's courage should be like a bucket, and the blood stains the spring embroidery of Xuanting. The autumn family pavilion is beautiful in the wind and rain. I wish the heroic children and women boundless life, draw a picture, and lay down pepper wine.</p>

<p>Mr. Hu Jichen, editor of the Shanghai Municipal Chronicle Museum, is an old friend of the poet Liu Yazi and a former member of the Southern Society. Mr. Hu is clumsy in socializing, but his words are full of humor. Recently, I saw a letter he sent to Mr. Liu, saying: "I saw the Jin Lu Qu in the Spring and Autumn edition on the seventh day, which is very good. The first sentence calls himself an old man, and I already know that 'the dance master's intention is not in the woman.' Now I have changed a poem from Qian Jia Shi and present it as a gift:</p>
<p>Powder is greasy and fragrant, the sky is at noon, dragging flowers and belts, dancing in the hall. People don't know your heart is bitter, and they will say that Lun Xian is learning from young people.</p>
<p>Borrowing other people's doggerel and replying, I don't know what you think, brother." This short letter and poem are quite interesting, so I recorded it to fill the Spring and Autumn edition. (Not for remuneration)</p>

<p>(Q) How does gallbladder hydrops occur?</p>
<p>(A) When the cystic duct is blocked, gallbladder hydrops or hydrops of the gallbladder may occur without jaundice.</p>
<p>(Q) How does cholemia occur?</p>
<p>(A) When the bile duct is blocked, jaundice occurs first, followed by cholemia, which leads to bleeding, digestive disorders, and decreased heart function, eventually leading to lethargy and death.</p>
<p>(Q) How does cancer occur?</p>
<p>(A) Cancer occurs due to constant irritation from gallstones.</p>
<p>(Q) How do complications such as cholangitis occur?</p>
<p>(A) After pathogens invade, they can cause cholangitis, cholecystitis, portal vein inflammation, and even liver abscesses. There can also be compression necrosis of the biliary tract, scar stenosis, etc.</p>
<p>(Q) How does peritonitis occur?</p>
<p>(A) Peritonitis occurs because gallstones penetrate the stomach, intestines, colon, or abdominal cavity.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the diagnostic methods for gallstone disease?</p>

<h3 id="e210">Methods to Prevent Influenza (Commonly Known as the Common Cold) <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Original by Prof. Dr. W. Berger et al., Translated and Abridged by Chen Shengbai</p>
<p>(Chen) For those who are prone to colds, such as infants, pregnant women, postpartum women, the elderly, patients in the recovery period, those who have just undergone surgery, those with rickets, scoliosis, and those with circulatory diseases, patients with scarlet fever and measles, visiting patients should be prohibited or they should stay away from epidemic areas. As for the use of protective masks, isolation, and taking quinine in poor environments, many misfortunes can be avoided.</p>
<p>(Ji) Refer to Prausnitz's report. During the flu epidemic, the waiting time in hospitals, clinics, and official waiting rooms should be shortened as much as possible. Especially in hospitals, the opportunity for infection during the waiting period can lead to rampant transmission of colds.</p>
<p>(Geng) Hospital management also plays an important role in group prevention of the flu. Like</p>
<p>A Hospital authorities should be obligated to report that hospitalization of a flu patient poses a risk of infection. Therefore, hospital authorities should always be concerned about it.</p>
<p>B Patient isolation</p>
<p>C Seriously ill patients, especially those with pneumonia or patients who have died of pneumonia, should have their wards thoroughly disinfected. Because there is a close relationship between the flu and pneumonia.</p>
<p>D General prohibition of visiting patients Any disease, or at least a dangerous disease, should be prevented from spreading. Of course, the flu is no exception. When it is unavoidable, as mentioned above, protective masks should be worn, fingers should be cleaned, and quinine should be taken internally.</p>
<p>E Sincere publicity and guidance, constant monitoring, rapid information. The use of quinine and protective masks. Ordinary people also have an obligation to implement them effectively. Doctors and nurses in hospitals are already in a guiding position. We should intensify the work that should be done.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the combined effect of the above methods is effective. However, the individual's energy, the thoroughness of implementation, and the adaptation of organizational technology and methods to us also have a great impact on infection prevention.</p>
<p>(Yi) Prevention of Disease Method</p>
<p>The chances of flu transmission are so high. And it is so difficult to prevent its transmission. So its infection cannot be avoided in case of emergency. After being infected, one should pay attention to the following guidelines on how to prevent the onset of disease.</p>
<p>Individual Prevention of Disease</p>
<p>(Zi) One should strictly guard against cold, overwork, malnutrition, dust, smoking and other factors that can cause the onset of disease.</p>
<p>(Chou) Quinine Oral Prevention Method Drug prevention is most effective, and has been proven by scholars' experiments. Up to now. Quinine is still recognized as the number one. Quinine for the flu is the same as for malaria. Has value in prevention and treatment.</p>
<p>A Quinine prevention method time and duration</p>
<p>Once the epidemic period begins. If you take quinine orally. Until no new cases are reported. Of course it's the best way. As for sporadic or persistent epidemics. It is also necessary to continue taking it. Others for professional reasons. Or those who have intermittent flu attacks should take it all year round or from December 1 to April 4.</p>
<p>The so-called short-term prevention method. That is, emergency measures for unavoidable visits, minor colds among colleagues, and gatherings in epidemic areas.</p>
<p>B The choice of drugs should conform to the principles of comfort, ease of administration, and no bad taste. Such as Quinisal (Cbin, BisalicBoehringer 0.25)．Chininperlen＂Zimmer＂(0.05-0.1 und 0.2 ChinHydrrochl puriss) etc. As for whether it is more effective to take quinine alone or to take it with salicylic acid (Acid Salicyl) preparations. Still needs to be reported separately.</p>
<p>C Dosage has large doses. 0.25-0.5 daily. There are small amounts. 0.5 daily.</p>
<p>D Side effects According to the prevention method of quinine and salicylic acid at 0.25 that we use. There are very few side effects.</p>
<p>(Yin) Prevention of Disease with Other Drugs</p>
<p>A. Kleinert's Salicyl．＆Urotropin</p>
<p>B H. Berg's iodine prevention method</p>
<p>C Spitta's Protargol nasal drip method. All have considerable effects.</p>
<p>D Due to oral hygiene (gargling with Panflavin, Formamint, etc. and washing with disinfectant water), the resulting effects are probably not very reliable.</p>
<p>(Mao) Although the special immune prevention method has not been scientifically and rigorously proven. But it has value in use. Unfortunately, the lasting effect of this method cannot be extended very much. So it is necessary to repeat the vaccination.</p>
<p>The so-called mixed vaccine. Refers to many dead bacteria that can cause colds. According to general experience. Seems to have no great effect</p>
<p>Group Prevention of Disease</p>
<p>The group prevention method to prevent the occurrence of colds. It is not only limited to the rules of infection prevention mentioned above. At the same time, the government should also. Overall planning. To study how to avoid the causes of disease. Like heating equipment. Nutrition supply, etc.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Although there are more than just these prevention methods for the flu. But if you can implement the main guidelines mentioned above, you will definitely be able to reduce the onset of colds. Reduce the infectious power of colds. Finally. I want to solemnly declare again. Is that in addition to protective masks, banning visits, isolation and other methods. An easy-to-use oral quinine prevention method. For infection prevention, especially disease prevention. Because it has a definitive effect. Therefore, I would like to give a strong introduction to readers again. (The End)</p>

<p>Section 3 Alveolar Pyorrhea</p>
<p>(Question 87) What are the symptoms of non-infectious periodontitis?</p>
<p>(Answer) The common symptoms have already been explained in question 78 above. All the symptoms are not as severe as those of acute infectious diseases. However, the periodontal membrane becomes mildly congested and inflamed, and the teeth are slightly raised and sore. However, if it is not cured for a long time, it is easy to be infected and cause suppuration, and the symptoms become severe.</p>
<p>(Question 88) What kind of disease is alveolar pyorrhea?</p>
<p>(Answer) Alveolar pyorrhea, commonly known as "ya gan" in our country. Although it also has inflammation of the periodontal membrane, it is completely different from what was discussed in Section 2 above. The teeth themselves are mostly intact and there are no changes. However, the alveolar bone gradually atrophies, and there is often a kind of pus flowing out of the gums. If not treated, the teeth will gradually loosen and fall out naturally. Moreover, after this disease occurs, it is often not limited to one tooth, and neighboring teeth often show the same symptoms, eventually falling out. This disease is very common, and many teeth are lost because of it. Therefore, it can be considered the two most common and most harmful types of dental diseases together with tooth decay and pulpitis and periodontitis caused by tooth decay. Most of the work of dentists is spent on treating these two types of diseases</p>
<p>(Question 89) What are the causes of alveolar pyorrhea?</p>
<p>(Answer) The causes are very complicated and there is still no definite cause. Most of them are due to the lime contained in the saliva and food debris, etc., adhering to the neck of the teeth. After accumulation for a long time, it gradually hardens into a layer of dirt like stone. This is called dental calculus (it can also be formed by the accumulation of blood excretions). Because of the stimulation of this dental calculus, the gums will become congested and inflamed, and after a long time, they will separate from the teeth to form a sac. Germs and dirt invade, and pus leakage occurs. But it can also be caused by systemic diseases. Such as syphilis, diabetes, lung disease, neurasthenia, etc.</p>
<p>(Question 90) How many types of alveolar pyorrhea can be divided into?</p>
<p>(Answer) It can be divided into three types, and the symptoms of each type are slightly different.</p>
<p>(Question 91) What are the symptoms of the first type?</p>
<p>(Answer) There is a circle of black and hard dental calculus around the neck of the teeth. The edge of the gums is red, swollen and inflamed. This symptom is relatively mild and is the initial stage of alveolar pyorrhea. Most sacs have not formed; most have no pus.</p>

<p>Section 6: Specialized Stimulus Therapy - Tuberculin</p>
<p>What tuberculin is, and its value in the diagnosis of this disease, have been described in detail in Chapter 8 of this book! But besides diagnosis, it also has great value in the treatment of this disease: many people even claim that if used properly, it can be considered a specialized and effective treatment! We know that tuberculin is made from tubercle bacillus toxin, hence the name tuberculin; if injected into the human body, it causes great changes in the inflammatory state of the lesion, the slightest being an increase in redness and swelling of the lesion, and more severe cases may cause the lesion to collapse. Therefore, in principle, it can directly reach the lesion; and it cannot be treated in the same way as other methods that increase the vitality of the body to resist the spread of bacteria.</p>
<p>But although the principle is like this, it cannot be done like this in practice; if a large amount is rashly injected into the human body, it is true that the lesion may collapse, but severe systemic reactions will also occur; what happens in this regard, such as high fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, etc., will inevitably damage the patient's body. It may even cause life-threatening dangers.</p>
<p>Then, how should we start in the treatment of this disease? It is based on the established practice of auto-immunization, applied to patients to achieve the purpose of treatment. The method starts with extremely small doses, and then slowly and gradually increases to large doses. This method allows the patient to gradually become accustomed to the medicinal power; as the dose gradually increases, the medicinal power becomes greater, and the patient's resistance also becomes greater, and the body's organs also become stronger day by day; the power to resist the spread of tubercle bacillus toxin will naturally increase accordingly. If the patient has good adaptability, this dose can eventually be increased to half a cubic centimeter or one cubic centimeter. But the initial dose is only about one hundred thousandth, which shows the huge difference in dosage before and after! Therefore, patients who receive this treatment need a very long period. Generally, the period required for each dose is at least three months, usually about six months, or even up to a year. If it is less than three months, it has no value in treatment. The use of tuberculin is usually best done by subcutaneous injection; generally, two injections per week, and only one injection when using large doses. If a reaction occurs, the dose for the next injection must not be increased, at most limited to maintain the injection dose of the previous injection. In addition to the subcutaneous injection procedure, there are also intradermal injection procedures, and there are also two methods of intradermal inoculation and rubbing; but none of them are as common as subcutaneous injection, and doctors use them less in clinical practice, so they are all omitted here!</p>

<p>— (Xiaofeng)</p>
<p>The most common skin diseases on our face are acne, rosacea, and freckles. Acne and rosacea often occur at the same time. There are small papules, and there are also purulent ones. The cause of these two conditions is mostly due to excessive sebum secretion and the occurrence of obstacles. Freckles are flat spots on the skin, brown or yellow, mostly limited to the cheeks and nose, not as widespread as acne and rosacea. The cause of freckles is the deposition of a pigment in the skin, which is visible when exposed to light. There are many methods to treat acne, rosacea, and freckles. In addition to various external treatments, such as injecting acne serum for acne and rosacea, it is either slow to take effect or the procedure is cumbersome. If you want a simple and quick effect, the most reliable one currently on the market is "Mianli." "Mianli" has extremely high-quality ingredients and a special formulation, so it is effective for treating facial skin diseases such as acne, rosacea, and freckles. Simple and easy to perform.

<p>— (Zhao Zhou)</p>
<p>Gonorrhea is very harmful. If it is not cured in time, there will be many complications, and the disease will become more and more difficult to treat. For example, acute becomes chronic, the anterior urethra becomes the posterior urethra, and it can also invade the rectum to become rectal gonorrhea. It can also be complicated by epididymitis, urethral stricture, prostatitis, arthritis, seminal vesiculitis, spermatic cord inflammation, etc. The cause of this disease is the invasion of gonococci, which causes inflammation of the urethral mucosa. If treatment is sought as soon as possible after the initial infection, other mixed symptoms can be avoided. Otherwise, delaying the time, or being careless with medicine, may lead to lifelong harm. There are those who transmit it to their wives and children. The suffering is prolonged, which not only wastes time and abandons careers, but also cuts off the line of descendants. The harm is so profound. In modern times, the most reasonable and effective treatments for gonorrhea are short-wave diathermy and the injection of mixed vaccines. The Sun Weicai Father and Son Hospital, which is famous for treating venereal diseases in Shanghai, always uses this method to treat this disease. Whether it is acute or chronic gonorrhea, or complicated by various symptoms, once started, all are cured. The author sees that there are more and more people infected with gonorrhea in the city, and there are very few who get good medical treatment. Therefore, I would like to say a word to the sufferers.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Miraculous Experience of Treating Psoriasis with Ganlu <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— (Shoucheng)</p>
<p>"Ganlu" medicinal water is famous both in China and abroad. Whether patients or doctors, it has been publicly recognized as the leader in skin disease treatments. Its effectiveness is unparalleled. Mr. Shi Sanli suffered from psoriasis for almost six or seven years. He had been treated repeatedly without effect. Although he heard that it was effective for a while, it recurred after a certain period of time. Money was wasted and he suffered greatly. This May, he visited me for treatment. I saw that his scabs were piled up and the bloodstains were mottled all over his body. So I told him to buy "Ganlu" to apply. In just a few days, he achieved an effect that exceeded my expectations. After about two weeks of continuous application, he completely eliminated the stubborn disease that had lasted for several years. Until now in July, it has not recurred. With this magical medicine, people with skin diseases can rest easy. (Note: "Ganlu" medicinal water is a fine product of Tongren Pharmacy, No. 1 Dexing Lane, Xinxin Bridge Street, French Concession, Shanghai. The raw materials are of high quality and the medicinal power is accurate. Since its launch, it has spread throughout the country. The price is one yuan per bottle.)</p>

<p>— (Huairou)</p>
<p>Opium flourished in the late Qing Dynasty. In the past hundred years, it has been a major disaster for our national customs. Its harm is more severe than floods and fierce beasts. Although the people know it well, those who practice it are still the same. It consumes energy and damages wealth, and nothing is more serious than this. The country is declining and the nation is weak, and subjugation can be expected. This is why enlightened people are heartbroken, and the government has repeatedly ordered and strictly prohibited it. Now the prohibition orders are brilliant and the laws are strict. Those who are addicted to it should be vigilant. On the one hand, for the sake of their own happiness, on the other hand, to avoid being caught in the net of law, it is imperative to quit smoking addiction. However, there are many people in the world who talk about quitting smoking. Either they do not get the right method and fail to cure it, or they do not examine whether the body of the person quitting is able to bear it, which often causes mistakes. Only Dr. She Zhen, No. 64 Ningbo Road, French Concession, Shanghai, can be said to be good at quitting smoking. His experience is rich and his method of quitting is stable. There is no one better than him. Once the abstinence is implemented, you will feel disgusted when you see smoke, and you can still work as usual. There is no mental pain. He is truly a beacon for fellow countrymen in the underworld.</p>

<p>— (Ji Wu)</p>
<p>Young people are often tempted by external sensations and driven by internal impulses. They often commit the bad habit of masturbation, which leads to symptoms such as nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, and premature ejaculation. Unconsciously, they gradually become ill. When doing things, they often feel weak limbs, tinnitus, and palpitations. Even more seriously, they have weak memory and are forgetful in everything. After a little trouble, they feel dizzy and dizzy, and the pain is unspeakable. If this continues, not only will they suffer a great blow mentally, but also there will be many difficulties in their careers and work. As for the weakening of sexual function as a result, and the pleasure of the boudoir becoming a long-standing regret, it is a hidden pain that cannot be told to outsiders. All of these are very obvious diseases. In summary, it is neurasthenia. Those who suffer from it mostly endure it in silence, but the harm is immeasurable. Since I have been in clinical practice, based on my experience, in addition to electrotherapy and various injection therapies, the "Haierbang Pills" sold by Tongren Pharmacy, No. 1 Dexing Lane, Xinxin Bridge Street, Fada Road, Shanghai, have the greatest, fastest, and most effective effect. It can be recommended as a good medicine for treating neurasthenia. The price is two yuan per bottle, and it is most suitable for those who treat themselves to buy and take.</p>

<p>— (Min Xiu)</p>
<p>The uterus is an organ unique to women. Therefore, uterine diseases are also gynecological diseases. The most common uterine disease we encounter is endometritis. Pinworm invasion, not taking care of oneself during menstruation and childbirth, excessive sexual activity, etc., are all causes of endometritis. Among all microbial infections, gonococci are the most common. Therefore, it is called gonorrheal endometritis. Its symptoms, acute ones, include severe pain in the genitals, heavy pressure in the lower abdomen, frequent urination, difficulty defecating, chills, fever, red and swollen uterine mucosa, and leucorrhea. There is even putrefaction and foul odor. Chronic symptoms are milder than acute ones, but often worsen due to intercourse or menstruation. Leucorrhea also increases accordingly. Patients should be treated as soon as possible to prevent the disease from penetrating deep into the uterus. We mostly use "Oral Leucorrhea Pills" and "External Leucorrhea Medicine" to treat general female genital diseases with leucorrhea symptoms, and they are all cured when taken at the same time.</p>
<p>(Editor's note: The Oral Leucorrhea Pills and External Leucorrhea Medicine sold by Sun Weicai Father and Son Hospital, No. 64 Ningbo Road, French Concession, Shanghai, have great effects. Women suffering from red and white leucorrhea and preventing endometritis can take them as directed, and they will all be effective. It is said that each box sells for two yuan.)</p>

<p>— (Yu Chen)</p>
<p>People rely on diet to live. Even children know this. However, improper drinking and immoderate eating can lead to disease. If you already have stomach disease, you must engage in recuperation. The method of recuperation must be based on the condition of the disease. In short, there should be a fixed amount of drinking and a fixed time for eating. Avoid the stimulation of spicy peppers and vinegar, and avoid the improperness of being too cold or too hot. Tough foods are prohibited. Greasy foods are also unsuitable. Choose foods that are easy to digest and drink things that do not harm the stomach. If there is acid reflux, noisy feelings, nausea, fullness, burning sensation and pain in the stomach, this indicates that the stomach disease has reached a considerable degree. It is useless without appropriate medicines to assist. However, there are many ready-made stomach medicines on the market. Not only do patients have nowhere to turn, but even doctors have difficulty distinguishing between clear and turbid. Based on my past clinical experience, only "Weibiling" is the most reliable medicine. It neutralizes acid and stops vomiting, helps digestion, removes fullness, relieves stomach cramps, and relieves pain. It is said to treat both the symptoms and the root cause. (Editor's note: "Weibiling" is indeed a holy product for treating stomach diseases. Each box is sold exclusively by Tongren Pharmacy)</p>

<p>— (Qi Hou)</p>
<p>Gonorrhea is easy to transmit but difficult to cure. This is because gonococci invade the human body and are deeply hidden in the gaps between the mucous membranes. Moreover, the structure of the bacteria is a capsule of gonococci. The efficacy of ordinary gonorrhea treatments such as copaiba and sandalwood oil is ordinary. Killing is more difficult. Moreover, it is well known that sandalwood oil stimulates the kidneys and harms the stomach and intestines. There are many methods to treat gonorrhea in our clinical practice. However, if you want to find an ideal oral medicine, it must have no side effects, and the effect of killing bacteria must be great. Is it only "Gonadoteng"? This medicine does have a real good effect. Therefore, it has been happily used by medical professionals at home and abroad. It is also welcomed by patients. This agent is made according to the latest theory using special chemical methods. It has a strong bactericidal power, and its penetrating power is even more meticulous. It is really beyond the reach of ordinary gonorrhea treatments. Other effects such as anti-inflammatory, pain relief, antiseptic, diuretic, blood purification, and detoxification are even more rapid. I have tried it repeatedly, and all have achieved complete treatment. That is why I dare to introduce it. (Note: "Gonadoteng" is sold by Tongren Pharmacy, No. 1 Dexing Lane, Xinxin Bridge Street, Fada Road, Shanghai. The price is two yuan per box.)</p>

<p>Once Effective</p>
<p>I committed the bad habit of masturbation when I was young. In recent years, I have often felt dizzy, dizzy, forgetful, insomnia, and my eyes are dull. I have nocturnal emission once every four or five days, which has led to a weak body and all kinds of diseases. Although I have repeatedly taken kidney tonifying medicines sold on the market, they have rarely been effective. Now a friend advises me to take "Haierbang" pills from Tongren Pharmacy in Shanghai, saying that he has taken them with great effect. I would like to ask if my symptoms can also be treated with it and how much is effective. (Zhao Mingde asked)</p>
<p>(Answer) "Haierbang" is effective in treating neurasthenia, nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, and other symptoms. Ordinary symptoms will be completely effective in one or two bottles. If you can take it for a long time, it will strengthen the nerves and repair weakness. Freckles are not painful, but because they are born on the face, the spots are piled up, which is very unattractive. Seven people in my family, and three of them suffer from it. It shows that many people have freckles. Although there are medicines to treat freckles on the market, they have been used repeatedly, and the skin is often greatly stung. As a result, it is still the same as before. Recently, I heard that using "Mianli" to treat it often has miraculous effects. How is it really? Sir, you should tell me the truth. (Cai Jisheng asked)</p>
<p>(Answer) "Mianli" is made using chemical methods. Therefore, it is effective in treating freckles. And the material is noble and different from ordinary products.</p>
<p>Gonadoteng</p>
<p>My mother has had ringworm for many years. After buying and using "Ganlu" medicinal water from Tongren Pharmacy in Shanghai, it was completely cured in just one week. Now I have suffered from leucorrhea for a long time. Money and spirit have been lost. I know that the pharmacy sells the gonorrhea medicine "Gonadoteng", which is quite effective. But I don't know if my disease has become chronic. Can taking it achieve the purpose of complete cure? (Yuan Chongjie asked)</p>
<p>(Answer) "Gonadoteng" treats gonorrhea. Regardless of new or old, it has a real effect. It has been repeatedly clinically tried by famous engineers and all have praised it. It is said that each box sells for two yuan.</p>
<p>Leucorrhea like cotton</p>
<p>My wife had leucorrhea for no reason a month ago. It has been many days now. The more it goes down, the more it goes down. Although she has been treated with medicine repeatedly, it has not been effective. But I used to suffer from gonorrhea. It has been three months since it was cured. I don't know if it has anything to do with this. I would like to ask you and please introduce a good medicine. (Zhang Sen asked)</p>
<p>(Answer) According to the description, it may be related to gonorrhea. You must seek medical treatment as soon as possible. No. 64 Ningbo Road, French Concession, this city.

Hongxin has a mother, Huang, 48 years old, who has always had stomach pain, which comes and goes. This time, Huang's old illness recurred and suddenly became serious. She was bedridden and moaning. Liu Hongxin had read a small book and knew that there was such a thing as cutting one's thigh to treat one's parent. At 11 o'clock the night before, he carried a sharp knife and went secretly to an open space on Xiaoshadu Road. He cut a piece of meat from his left arm, about two inches long. At that time, a Western policeman was patrolling and saw him holding a sharp knife. His behavior was suspicious and he was taken to the police station. Later, Liu Hongxin explained the situation of cutting his thigh to treat his parent. Seeing that his left arm was injured, he was sent to the hospital for bandaging. The injury was not serious.</p>
<p>Liu Hongxin is indeed a filial son. He saw that his mother's old illness had recurred and suddenly became serious. In order to treat her, he did not hesitate to cut a piece of meat from his left arm with a sharp knife. This is not easy for ordinary people to do. But although Liu Hongxin's filial piety is commendable, he is still a foolish filial son, who does not understand that if his mother is sick, she should see a doctor for treatment. It cannot be cured by a piece of meat. However, the reason why he cut the meat was not a method that he came up with out of thin air. He wanted to use meat instead of medicine, saying that he was trying to treat his mother's stomach pain. But he learned it from a book. It turned out that he usually reads small books and knows that the ancients had the story of "cutting one's thigh to treat one's parent". Therefore, he was driven by filial piety and learned to be a filial son. He didn't know that the result was not only that he cut the meat and hurt himself, but it also did not help his mother's illness in the slightest. Moreover, because he was holding a sharp knife and his behavior was suspicious, he was taken to the police station by the Western policeman for questioning. Liu Hongxin can be said to be "his filial piety is commendable, and his foolishness is beyond compare".</p>
<p>However, what we want to say here is not to praise Liu Hongxin and give him the beautiful name of "filial son" to promote benevolence and save the decadent customs. What we should pay attention to is the great influence of words. In the past, we heard that three apprentices, after reading novels such as "The Strange Heroes of the Jianghu", suddenly became obsessed and went to the mountains together to find Taoism and seek immortality, imitating the stories of the strange heroes. There was also Shi Jianqiao, who assassinated Sun Chuanfang not long ago. This filial daughter avenged her father. According to her own confession, it was because she read the story of "Shang Sanguan" in Liaozhai, which was deeply imprinted in her mind. She thought that although the story was fabricated, the fact was not impossible. Therefore, she decided to assassinate and do something that shocked society. The sentence "I dare not forget my father's hatred for a moment" in the leaflet she distributed was also copied from the original sentence in the "Yu Jiang" chapter of Liaozhai. From these facts, we can see the depth of the influence of words. A "Strange Heroes of the Jianghu" can call three apprentices to go to the mountains to find Taoism and seek immortality. A section of "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" can make a woman avenge her father. A story of "cutting one's thigh to treat one's parent" can induce a peddler to cut a piece of meat to treat his mother's illness. The influence of words is so amazing.</p>
<p>How should people engaged in education and culture pay attention to this point? Although our country has been baptized by foreign new ideas in recent times, the feudal consciousness in society is still very common. We must eliminate this old force in the future, starting from the cultural aspect, so that everyone can establish a correct consciousness that is in line with modern life. The authorities should conduct an inspection of the cultural circles in our country, and eliminate everything that is not suitable for today. In this way, all unreasonable behaviors in society may be expected to gradually decrease. We feel very dangerous when we see the prevalence of many bad books on the market.</p>

<p>— Hei Ding</p>
<p>Winter.</p>
<p>The cold wind whipped through Balamacun, home to the Daur people near the lower reaches of the Girin River, already creating a deathly, indifferent scene. The boundless wilderness was covered with a thick layer of white snow. The Girin River, like a wide, white ribbon, meandered and lay still on the left side of Gahashan Mountain.</p>
<p>It was just after lunchtime. The five-year-old (implied: older than 50) Lu Zhisuo, shivering, and his ten-year-old grandson, Biya, were urging their dog sled back along the mountain path of Cikun Mountain. Biya's small face was red and flushed, as if he had drunk a few cups of wine. He wore a large, shaggy dog-skin hat on his head. His eyes were so covered that he could barely see the road ahead. As he walked, he kept pushing the hat up on his head with his hand, which was hidden in a leather glove. He also puffed out his cheeks, wrinkled his nose, and muttered:</p>
<p>— Damn your mother...</p>
<p>The hat was pushed almost to the point of falling off.</p>
<p>Lu Zhisuo took out a dry tobacco pipe from a leather bag on his back, packed it with tobacco, struck a match with a "scratch" sound, and started puffing on it. He heard Biya muttering and opened his dry lips to grumble:</p>
<p>— I told you not to wear it this morning, but you wouldn't listen. Didn't your mother tell you, but you wouldn't listen. If you do that again, you won't come out with me. If you hadn't come today, would that old fox have escaped? It's all your fault, all your fault...</p>
<p>Biya became unhappy with his grandfather's grumbling, and his face was covered with anger. He stubbornly walked ahead of his grandfather, head down, not paying attention to anything.</p>
<p>Dozens of steps away from the village, three elderly men stood by the river, chatting loudly. Among the three men were Lu Zhisuo's neighbor, Baske, and two others who came from elsewhere. As soon as Baske saw Lu Zhisuo coming from the mountain path, he raised his hand, raised his voice, and shouted:</p>
<p>— Hey, Old Lu, are you lucky? You must have caught a lot again?</p>
<p>The sound reached Lu Zhisuo's ears, causing him to suddenly lift his face and take a look. Then, he waved his palm, showing a very frustrated look, and replied as he walked:</p>
<p>— Lucky? If I was any luckier, I wouldn't be able to pull the dog sled back!</p>
<p>He coughed, paused, and continued:</p>
<p>— It's all because of this kid, Biya. If he hadn't come, I wouldn't have let that old fox escape! Hmph, lucky? Look, the dog sled is coming back empty.</p>
<p>— This is really, this is really...</p>
<p>Baske sighed repeatedly.</p>
<p>Lu Zhisuo had already approached Baske. He stopped and smiled at the two elderly men standing next to Baske on his left. Then, he asked Baske:</p>
<p>— These two?</p>
<p>He also smiled knowingly at the two elderly men.</p>
<p>At that moment, Baske was reaching out to grasp Biya's wrist, opening his mouth, which reeked of alcohol from having just drunk, and drunkenly said:</p>
<p>— Hey, to be able to go hunting in the mountains with your grandfather at the age of ten is really a capable little fellow.</p>
<p>He kept laughing.</p>
<p>Baske heard Lu Zhisuo asking him, quickly turned his face, and with a calm attitude and urgent tone, introduced the two elderly men to Lu Zhisuo:</p>
<p>— This is Bitun Ku, and this is Chaisi Tai. They are from Gesaer Town.</p>
<p>Lu Zhisuo nodded, put on an enthusiastic look, and kindly asked the two elderly men:</p>
<p>— Oh, oh, such a long way, you two must be here for something, right?</p>
<p>Before they could speak, Baske quickly interjected:</p>
<p>— Don't you know? Gesaer Town has also been occupied by ×</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>× soldiers! It was just occupied yesterday. These two escaped from the town!</p>
<p>Lu Laisuo shuddered. He stared blankly, speechless. After a long time, he slowly said in his throat:</p>
<p>— Oh, escaped...</p>
<p>Seemingly thinking, he sighed with some anger:</p>
<p>— Alas, the world has changed! This is a great disaster! How did ×× soldiers occupy that place, and now they are coming to seize this place...</p>
<p>The atmosphere could no longer be calm. Then, Bitun Ku, who had just been introduced by Baske, unconsciously clenched his fist, widened his eyes, and said bitterly:</p>
<p>— The town was in chaos yesterday! ×× soldiers came from Girin, more than two hundred of them! As soon as they arrived in the town, they searched every household one by one. And they confiscated all the firearms in the town. There's also a rumor that in a few days, they will even confiscate the homemade guns that we hunters use.</p>
<p>Lu Zhisuo was so frightened that he gasped for air, and said:</p>
<p>— What, what, even the homemade guns that we hunters use...?</p>
<p>Bitun Ku took out a dry tobacco pipe from his robe, smoked it, and said:</p>
<p>— This is really hopeless. What else can we rely on for a living! Alas! Alas... I heard that the Gularin area has also been very chaotic recently, with many more ×× soldiers. They all say that they are preparing to fight the Big Nose Country (Note 1), but I don't know if it's true or false... Now disaster has come upon us! Everyone in the town has fled today. Because this morning, two ×× soldiers died on the street, covered in blood. It looked like they were killed last night...</p>
<p>Before Bitun Ku could finish, Chaisi Tai, who had been silent for a long time, anxiously interrupted:</p>
<p>— Today, the town was like the sky had fallen. ×× soldiers arrested a lot of people, some Solun people, some Oron people, and some Biral people. They killed them all without asking questions. ×× soldiers also said that we were going to rebel, but they are the ones rebelling! They won't let us live...</p>
<p>— Nuoya, Nuoya... (Note 3)</p>
<p>A few sighs from women could be heard in the distance. Then, the voices of women calling their children could be heard.</p>
<p>At this time, the large group of children playing, pulling sleds, and ice skating on the riverside at both ends of the town, suddenly heard this wildfire-like shocking news, and everyone was so frightened that their faces changed. They stood still, as if they had lost their souls. Some of them shouted hoarsely:</p>
<p>— Oh my! ×× soldiers are coming! Where can we run?</p>
<p>The children all ran home.</p>
<p>Biya also urged the dog sled and ran home.</p>
<p>Lu Zhisuo's pale face was covered with a gloomy, depressed color. After a long time, he seemed to wake up from a nightmare and muttered in a hoarse voice:</p>
<p>— Then, then, what are we going to do? If our hunting guns are really confiscated, will we have any way to survive...?</p>
<p>His voice trembled. After a while, he said again:</p>
<p>— Baske, do you think ×× soldiers can come to our place from Gesaer Town again?</p>
<p>Baske shook his head and said he didn't know. At the same time, Bitun Ku and Chaisi Tai said in unison:</p>
<p>— Who can guarantee that? They can occupy wherever they want. Who can stop them...?</p>
<p>Suddenly, a mournful cry was blown by a gust of wind from afar:</p>
<p>— Years of rebellion! Nuoya! Nuoya!</p>
<p>This was Lu Zhisuo's old wife, Yishaya, who had rushed from home to the street, muttering and sighing. She was still a distance away from Lu Zhisuo when she hurriedly asked loudly:</p>
<p>— Is it true? The ×× soldiers have occupied Gesaer Town?</p>
<p>Lu Zhisuo pretended not to hear and didn't bother to answer her, just worrying himself.</p>
<p>Yishaya stopped.</p>
<p>Baske glanced at Yishaya, widened his eyes, and said:</p>
<p>— I'm afraid they will come to our place too...</p>
<p>Nuoya, Nuoya! What can we do? I'm going home to ask the Bodhisattva to bless us...</p>
<p>Yishaya muttered and limped home.</p>
<p>Lu Zhisuo silently followed behind his old wife Yishaya, walking, walking.</p>
<p>Dusk. Balamacun was deathly silent, and there was no one walking on the street.</p>
<p>Late at night. Balamacun was even more deathly silent, and a strong wind was blowing on the street.</p>
<p>Lu Zhisuo didn't sleep. He quietly knelt in front of the Bodhisattva, propped up his heavy, drowsy eyelids, his two melancholy eyes turning and turning, and said:</p>
<p>— Gaga! (Note 3) Bless Balamacun, bless us hunters...</p>
<p>Note: 1. They all call Russia the Big Nose Country.</p>
<p>2. Heavenly Grandfather, Heavenly Grandfather.</p>
<p>3. A term for God.</p>

<p>— Shi Weizhi</p>
<p>The sea is familiar to me.</p>
<p>I have seen it smile, under the warm sun, blowing a gentle breeze, the surface of the sea shimmering with golden water snakes, the water droplets jumping, like innocent children running and playing in the prairie; I have also seen its anger, the surface of the sea only hearing a roar, the waves rolling up higher than people, falling back to hit the stones on the shore, the sound can deafen people; I have also seen the sea's...</p>
<p>When the sea smiles, I am intoxicated, my heart is taken away by the jumping water droplets, I seem to fall in the great loving sea; when the sea is angry, I lower my head, I feel the insignificance of myself, before this great sea.</p>
<p>And also at this time, I can't help but shed tears. I am moved, I can only shed tears; besides shedding tears, what else can I do?</p>
<p>The sea is roaring again, still mixed with the bloody wind, my eyes feel another heat. With this resolution, I will be moved to tears again, but also with this resolution, besides shedding tears, I will also throw my insignificant self into the great sea, to shed a drop of blood, because I know that the great sea is originally made up of countless insignificant selves.</p>

<h3 id="e231">"Peach Blossoms After the Robbery" and the Scenery of Qingdao <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>"Peach Blossoms After the Robbery" is a creation by the playwright Hong Shen, published in "Literature". The play is set in Qingdao and is a wonderful film based on historical facts. In the twenty-third year of Guangxu in the former Qing Dynasty, Germany used the excuse of a priest being killed to send warships to occupy Jiaozhou Bay and seize it as a "concession"; after decades of deliberate management, Qingdao became an important commercial port and a military stronghold.</p>
<p>The mountains surrounding Qingdao are all built with forts, and among the green grass and trees, there are hidden heavy artillery with a caliber of more than ten inches - and flat roads have been built along the mountains and coasts to provide access to all directions. As for the city, there is no place that is not a magnificent building, and the tall foreign houses show a very prosperous scene. After the Xinhai Revolution, the surviving Qing elders and officials of the fallen country liked the protection of foreign forces in this place and regarded it as "Peach Blossom Spring Today"; they moved their families and settled down, and all were prepared to spend their old age in this countryside. However, good times did not last long. In the autumn of the third year of the Republic of China, the European War broke out, and Qingdao was seized by the Japanese Empire. "Ghosts fighting ghosts", needless to say, the losers are the Chinese people in our semi-colonial state. As a result, the tragedy of some surviving Qing elders and officials of the fallen country occurred. "Peach Blossoms After the Robbery" also points out the problem of survival for the people of semi-colonial China in this turbulent era.</p>
<h3 id="e232">Dentsu Stage Play Fully Mobilized <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>Dentsu Company will stage Chekhov's three famous plays for the first time, directed by Sun Shiyi and Xu Xingzhi. Director Sun directed the two plays "The Boor" and "The Anniversary", and Director Xu directed "The Proposal". In order to emphasize the plot, the two directors have slightly modified the script to increase interest.</p>
<p>The actors are particularly suitable for the personalities of the characters in Chekhov's three famous plays staged by Dentsu this time: the amorous Wang Ying plays the widow in "The Boor"; the vicious Jin Shan plays the debt collector in the play; as for the girl in "The Proposal", she is played by the petite Miss Chen Bo'er; the smiling Shi Chao plays a neighbor; the father is played by the old-fashioned Tian Lie, and the cast in "The Anniversary" are also very appropriate. The hot-handed and foot-handed Lan Ping plays the old woman; the extremely bored Gu Er plays the bookkeeper; the showy Lu Luming plays the chairman's wife; and the outwardly strong and inwardly weak cartoonist Cai Ruohong plays the chairman. The actors sat around the stove and rehearsed their lines, and although it was the cold winter season, it felt as warm as spring.</p>
<p>All the costumes for Dentsu's premiere are designed by Xu Xingzhi, with Lan Ping as a consultant, to ensure beauty and suitability. They are being rushed to production immediately.</p>
<p>In terms of stage design, Zhang Yunqiao, an expert in stage design, has been hired to draw three full-color stage drawings, which will be distributed to carpenters to build according to the drawings.</p>

<p>Xiao Ying'er Zhou Xuan plays a kind and amorous maid in "The Wedding Night". Partnering with the fat Guan Hongda, the performance is both serious and humorous, full of humor, and full of eroticism.</p>
<p>Xu Manli has formally joined Art China as a guest performer in "A Flower".</p>
<p>"The Incarnation Girl" will begin filming as soon as the script is approved, but the set is already being built.</p>
<p>Wang Chunquan, the photographer of "The Wedding Night", will be in charge of the photography for "A Flower".</p>
<p>Hu Yingying, the newcomer discovered in "The Incarnation Girl", is a naive and lovely sixteen-year-old girl who is still in school.</p>
<p>Art China has many sports fans, and several of them are almost always present for every football, basketball, and volleyball game.</p>
<p>Yan Youxiang, director of Art China's South China Office, returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong yesterday for official business.</p>
<p>Fang Peilin and Yuan Meiyun, the leading actress of "The Incarnation Girl", went to a French store on Avenue Joffre yesterday to order a "headgear".</p>
<p>"The Wedding Night" is scheduled to be released during the old lunar new year.</p>
<p>Hu Ping has sent a letter saying that she will be able to leave for Shanghai at the end of this month.</p>
